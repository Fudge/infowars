[00:00.000 --> 00:13.340]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.340 --> 00:34.260]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:34.260 --> 00:41.860]  ladies and gentlemen it is Monday the 21st day of September 2015 I am your
[00:41.860 --> 00:47.580]  host Alex Jones we're going to be live here for the next three hours joining us
[00:47.580 --> 00:54.620]  in studio is my friend Pat Riley we also have Jesse Ventura joining us coming up
[00:54.620 --> 00:59.540]  in the second hour we'll have open phones for that Pat Riley who is a personal
[00:59.540 --> 01:05.300]  trainer and a good friend of mine I'm friends with his wife and he we go out
[01:05.300 --> 01:12.540]  tubing and outdoor stuff fishing things like that he just took off three and a
[01:12.540 --> 01:16.380]  half weeks he does this every three or four years to go to Europe this time he
[01:16.380 --> 01:21.580]  went to Croatia Turkey and other areas where Europe basically borders the
[01:21.580 --> 01:32.140]  east and he witnessed the so-called refugees face-to-face and we've seen
[01:32.140 --> 01:37.580]  the stunts where the man throws his wife and kids on a train track and then
[01:37.580 --> 01:43.300]  it's implied that the police did it and the media plays along with this he
[01:43.300 --> 01:51.100]  witnessed this for himself and then he talked to local Turks he said oh he's
[01:51.100 --> 01:56.780]  done that twice this week at that restaurant the guy gets up on a fifth
[01:56.780 --> 02:01.980]  story balcony knocks out the window and then sits there banging his chair
[02:01.980 --> 02:05.740]  leaning back over while his wife and children stand at the bottom as a crowd
[02:05.740 --> 02:09.820]  gathers and says he's going to kill himself I don't get money and they
[02:09.820 --> 02:14.180]  start giving her thousands of dollars the equivalent of that in Turkish and
[02:14.180 --> 02:18.740]  euros and dollars and she just sits there with wads of cash flying at her at
[02:18.740 --> 02:24.980]  the luxury hotel and here's Pat staying in a really cheap hostel a really cheap
[02:24.980 --> 02:31.060]  place for his wife so you can save money and travel more worked for his money and
[02:31.060 --> 02:36.900]  then he's watching the giant con game and if it's a perfect metaphor for the
[02:36.900 --> 02:41.940]  West and how we're guilted into everything we do truly sickening he was
[02:41.940 --> 02:48.100]  in Istanbul when he saw that he's going to describe what he witnessed when he
[02:48.100 --> 02:52.660]  joins us in the last 30 minutes of the broadcast today there's a lot of huge
[02:52.660 --> 02:56.900]  news obviously but I remember about a month ago Joe Biggs covered this from
[02:56.900 --> 03:01.340]  his military sources and a few fragments of news that he was covering out of
[03:01.340 --> 03:07.060]  Afghanistan that Hillary was covering up we wrote articles about it as well at
[03:07.060 --> 03:11.300]  the time covering up sexual abuse of children when she was the head of the
[03:11.300 --> 03:17.540]  State Department well that's now in the New York Times yesterday September 20th
[03:17.540 --> 03:24.860]  US soldiers told to ignore sexual abuse of boys by Afghan allies and basically
[03:24.860 --> 03:29.820]  it's the exact same people Joe Biggs reported on a month ago you can pull up
[03:29.820 --> 03:35.140]  our article headlined Hillary covered up sexual abuse or ordered sexual abuse to
[03:35.140 --> 03:40.420]  be covered up in Afghanistan so again info wars.com just on the very tip of
[03:40.420 --> 03:45.220]  the spirit breaking news and information this is not a joke Saudi Arabia has been
[03:45.220 --> 03:50.700]  chosen to have the UN human rights panel probably get a feminist award or
[03:50.700 --> 03:55.300]  something from from Gloria Steinem but because I've got short hair she'll say
[03:55.300 --> 04:01.300]  I'm the enemy of America and women but that's how they operate Carrie says
[04:01.300 --> 04:07.060]  we're gonna accept 85,000 refugees see first it's 10,000 then it's 15,000 then
[04:07.060 --> 04:11.860]  it's 25,000 I said that two weeks ago I mean I just know their formula we're
[04:11.860 --> 04:15.580]  gonna take 10,000 refugees I'm your Lord and Savior Barack Obama I said so I'm
[04:15.580 --> 04:19.700]  gonna rename them this mountain I'm gonna shut down these power plants I'm
[04:19.700 --> 04:25.980]  gonna open the border because I'm King Obama well first it's 10,000 now it's
[04:25.980 --> 04:29.700]  85,000 then it'll be a million then it'll be two million then it'll be five
[04:29.700 --> 04:33.420]  million then it'll be 10 million that'll be 20 million that'll be 30 million it's
[04:33.420 --> 04:37.660]  40 million illegals right now in the country running around arrogant thinking
[04:37.660 --> 04:41.420]  everybody's there to serve them thinking everybody screwed them over just all the
[04:41.420 --> 04:46.500]  complete joke what a joke so that's over don't worry during the Emmy Awards they
[04:46.500 --> 04:50.020]  attacked Donald Trump is racist because he doesn't want to pay for everybody to
[04:50.020 --> 04:53.420]  come here and have their babies for free even though nobody else does that and
[04:53.420 --> 04:57.620]  of course Saudi Arabia financing all this won't take one of these darling
[04:57.620 --> 05:04.660]  little refugees Alex Jones harassed by TSA over jar of grape jelly that's right
[05:04.660 --> 05:08.260]  radio host Alex Jones had another run-in with the TSA after agent searched his
[05:08.260 --> 05:11.380]  bag and found a jar of grape jelly Jones said he went through the airport body
[05:11.380 --> 05:15.100]  scanner and a physical pat down but the TSA agents insisted upon searching his
[05:15.100 --> 05:18.660]  bags after finding the jar of grape jelly the agents told Jones he was lucky
[05:18.660 --> 05:22.620]  they would still allow him to fly after such a violation Jones recapped on the
[05:22.620 --> 05:26.620]  Sunday show they searched me for 35 minutes and I barely made my plane and
[05:26.620 --> 05:29.820]  they got such enjoyment out of it meanwhile last week federal air
[05:29.820 --> 05:33.140]  marshals were under investigation for filming sex with a prostitute while on
[05:33.140 --> 05:36.620]  duty the two air marshals based in Chicago allegedly used government
[05:36.620 --> 05:39.660]  issued phones to record their own sexual encounters with a prostitute and then
[05:39.660 --> 05:42.540]  shared them on their personal email accounts which they connected to their
[05:42.540 --> 05:46.220]  work phones according to the TSA and remember TSA demands the highest
[05:46.220 --> 05:49.020]  standards of integrity and professionalism let's hope if there's a
[05:49.020 --> 05:52.660]  hijacking and air marshals are aboard they pull out the right gun Rob do

[08:47.140 --> 08:52.700]  away where we had a case in Kansas they call it so part of it we have to break

[08:56.500 --> 09:00.460]  who belong to their families recognize kids belong to whole community I have
[09:00.460 --> 09:12.740]  decided we really need camps for adults all persons of Japanese descent were
[09:12.740 --> 09:16.900]  required to register now they were taken to race tracks and fairgrounds where the
[09:16.900 --> 09:24.700]  army almost overnight had built assembly centers what kind of a situation in the
[09:24.700 --> 09:32.340]  US would you see that happening I mean we've got a lot of people that are
[09:32.340 --> 09:35.980]  coming out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge to to build
[09:35.980 --> 09:42.540]  IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques these people are radicalized
[09:42.540 --> 09:46.380]  and they don't support the United States and they're disloyal to the United
[09:46.380 --> 09:50.900]  States it's our right and our obligation to segregate them from the normal
[09:50.900 --> 09:53.260]  community
[09:57.260 --> 10:01.860]  this is what we're doing here unless not kid about it we're building a domestic

[11:09.060 --> 11:17.780]  precious darling migrants refugees as they're called including mock suicide
[11:17.780 --> 11:23.540]  attempts stage to make the public donate money and we've seen the migrants
[11:23.540 --> 11:28.540]  staging dead bodies of children throwing children on railroad tracks attacking
[11:28.540 --> 11:32.220]  reporters and then running from them so they can be tripped and then say that
[11:32.220 --> 11:36.820]  they're victims the list goes on and on in Europe if you get smacked up side the
[11:36.820 --> 11:44.740]  head by a big rock and you criticize it you are arrested the former Stasi secret
[11:44.740 --> 11:48.860]  police have been reactivated that's mainstream German news they now work for
[11:48.860 --> 11:54.820]  Facebook and alert the government if you criticize the open borders for 5,000
[11:54.820 --> 12:02.940]  euro fines that's over $5,000 and or 120 days in jail unbelievable
[12:05.020 --> 12:11.140]  meanwhile McDonald's is leading the effort to promote migrant aid oh McDonald's
[12:11.140 --> 12:15.460]  is always pushing taking your guns opening your borders a true world
[12:15.460 --> 12:21.580]  government organization thousands more migrants poured into Austria as 13
[12:21.580 --> 12:30.100]  ground off Turkey Saudi Arabia is still not taking one single refugee refugee
[12:30.100 --> 12:34.900]  crisis to test EU at summit of divided leaders the eastern countries are being
[12:34.900 --> 12:39.100]  criticized for not taking more you've only taken three four million in the last
[12:39.100 --> 12:44.340]  year you should take them advertise everything's free so 20 million come and
[12:44.340 --> 12:48.940]  then 50 million and then a hundred million because it's your job to pay for
[12:48.940 --> 12:53.460]  it and the Swedes have to house people in their homes the government's proposing
[12:53.460 --> 12:58.100]  and they're raising new taxes across the EU to pay for it because it's your job
[12:58.100 --> 13:03.060]  no one else is in the world but Europe and America's job to pay for everything
[13:03.060 --> 13:10.660]  and now you see the guilt society now you see it
[13:10.660 --> 13:15.340]  Eastern European leaders in war of words as migrants pour across borders
[13:15.340 --> 13:25.580]  Reuters meanwhile look at this headline not a joke Saudi Arabia chosen to head
[13:25.580 --> 13:36.540]  UN rights panel that'd be like hiring a top pedophile to guard children it'd be
[13:36.540 --> 13:43.260]  like hiring Jerry Sandusky to run a children's orphanage well I guess he did
[13:43.260 --> 13:48.700]  kind of run one that's the whole point the Fox guarding the hen house fury after
[13:48.700 --> 13:55.620]  Saudi Arabia chosen to head key UN human rights panel Saudi Arabia is basically
[13:55.620 --> 14:01.740]  like North Korea with trillions in oil total freakville totally corrupt their
[14:01.740 --> 14:06.900]  people aren't that corrupt but their government is an absolute joke we have a
[14:06.900 --> 14:10.700]  teenager sentenced to death by crucifixion for taking part in anti-government
[14:10.700 --> 14:17.980]  protests in Saudi Arabia criticizing the government and illegally possessing a
[14:17.980 --> 14:27.180]  firearm faces death the mirror reports but don't worry they don't let women
[14:27.180 --> 14:30.860]  drive cars and they'll execute you for teaching the gospel but there are ally
[14:30.860 --> 14:36.860]  our gallant ally meanwhile Kerry again says we were to accept 85,000 refugees
[14:36.860 --> 14:43.260]  next year see first it's 10,000 then it's 85,000 then it's a million that's how
[14:43.260 --> 14:48.220]  they get you ready for it just standard psychological warfare tactic that's out
[14:48.220 --> 14:52.940]  of AP Rand Paul blames Hillary for refugee crisis yes she helped quarterback
[14:52.940 --> 14:56.180]  destabilizing the Middle East absolutely true that's from the Hill newspaper
[14:56.180 --> 15:01.820]  Rand Paul is on target 15,000 more refugees to be resettled in the US on
[15:01.820 --> 15:07.380]  top of the 85,000 Donald Trump says it wasn't the Swedes who blew up the World
[15:07.380 --> 15:11.980]  Trade Center you have extremist Muslims they are a class by themselves he's
[15:11.980 --> 15:18.540]  being called racist for claiming that jihadist terror is Muslim well it is you
[15:18.540 --> 15:22.900]  know I didn't follow the kid with the clock who said he built a clock to take
[15:22.900 --> 15:27.020]  it to school then turns out his dad is a top activist who's pulled stunts before
[15:27.020 --> 15:30.580]  and within hours of it happened the White House you know once the kid to come
[15:30.580 --> 15:34.660]  to the White House and it turns out he didn't build the clock it's it's just
[15:34.660 --> 15:39.060]  the guts of a digital clock from the 70s and he wouldn't respond and tell him it
[15:39.060 --> 15:44.620]  was a clock to cause the freakout that's why cops took him in was because they
[15:44.620 --> 15:49.020]  wanted to know if it was basically like a bomb threat hoax exposed Muslim
[15:49.020 --> 15:55.740]  student Ahmed Muhammad's briefcase clock is 1970s digital alarm clock a total
[15:55.740 --> 16:00.780]  staged event I don't normally agree with Bill Maher but coming up we have that
[16:00.780 --> 16:04.220]  clip we're gonna be playing it where he says look that it didn't look like a
[16:04.220 --> 16:09.140]  clock you've got him showing it to people wires hanging out of it looks
[16:09.140 --> 16:15.460]  like something out of a movie on purpose in my opinion but but this is how
[16:15.460 --> 16:20.180]  they stage everything of course Obama didn't have any of the families killed
[16:20.180 --> 16:25.140]  at the recruiting centers by jihadists to the White House to speak to them no
[16:25.140 --> 16:31.860]  no no and that ties into the next story I'm going to tell more coming up later
[16:31.860 --> 16:36.980]  in the hour I went to check into some syndication while I was there it's why
[16:36.980 --> 16:45.540]  it worked perfectly for the TV show slash radio show but also to be able to
[16:45.540 --> 16:51.300]  attend a friend's wedding up in Omaha Nebraska I've driven through Omaha but
[16:51.300 --> 17:00.020]  never never stayed there it's nice town and I'm flying out yesterday and they
[17:00.020 --> 17:04.900]  tear open my bag and they for 30 minutes search everything and then they say
[17:04.900 --> 17:09.260]  what is this do you know what this is I said yeah it's Concord grape jelly from
[17:09.260 --> 17:13.140]  farmers market I went to I bought some of the grapes too I've already eaten those
[17:13.140 --> 17:18.700]  I says you can they said well why do you have it and I said you see them the
[17:18.700 --> 17:22.900]  squash and the peppers and the things I bought here and my briefcase was half
[17:22.900 --> 17:26.740]  full of produce that's what I do I'm into farmers markets they said well you
[17:26.740 --> 17:30.500]  can't have it's a liquid and I said well actually it's grape jelly but it's
[17:30.500 --> 17:35.860]  it's it's it's a solid or and I said whatever they said well we're gonna have
[17:35.860 --> 17:40.380]  to search in do all the stuff to you again and it went on and on and it's just
[17:40.380 --> 17:45.260]  such a joke this this baptism of slavery this induction into serfdom this
[17:45.260 --> 17:51.260]  training that I'm a criminal and I'm a person that's guilty until proven slave
[17:51.260 --> 17:56.020]  not innocent until proven guilty not even guilty until proven innocent I'm
[17:56.020 --> 18:03.820]  always suspect I'm guilty guilty guilty and so after they've gone through all
[18:03.820 --> 18:07.820]  this rigamarole they wanted to put me in the body scanner and I'd already been
[18:07.820 --> 18:13.500]  basically pat it down and I did it because I was wanting to go ahead and
[18:13.500 --> 18:16.300]  see what the scanner was like after five years of demonstrating against it and
[18:16.300 --> 18:19.700]  protesting I've talked on here about maybe going ahead and doing it just to
[18:19.700 --> 18:24.980]  experience it so I could speak about it and then oh they got real mad and said
[18:24.980 --> 18:28.020]  something's in your back pocket and I said well you told me to go in there
[18:28.020 --> 18:33.060]  with my boarding pass they're all laughing at me and stuff and I just
[18:33.060 --> 18:37.700]  realized how much trouble this country's in but especially because the people in
[18:37.700 --> 18:44.420]  Omaha I guess are so conformist that they thought it was really cute to have me
[18:44.420 --> 18:50.180]  there 30 minutes and they waited till the last minute and said you're gonna miss
[18:50.180 --> 18:53.460]  your flight you're gonna miss your flight I said fine just makes the story
[18:53.460 --> 18:58.020]  bigger and then finally they're announcing my name over the loudspeaker as
[18:58.020 --> 19:02.980]  Southwest had the door open they closed it when I walked in the flight took off
[19:02.980 --> 19:10.420]  five minutes late Southwest waited for me to their credit and I flew back to
[19:10.420 --> 19:17.820]  Austin, Texas crammed in amongst the rest of proletariat and coach and while I
[19:17.820 --> 19:21.860]  was while they were taking off I was sending the photos to Buckley and the
[19:21.860 --> 19:27.660]  audio file my report while it's taxi I followed the report yesterday that
[19:27.660 --> 19:31.860]  aired on the news about an hour after I followed it so great job for the crew

[19:37.780 --> 19:42.500]  security alert over grape jelly that's the headline I wanted but whatever Paul
[19:42.500 --> 19:47.380]  Watson has the headline Alex Jones harassed by TSA over jar of grape jelly
[19:47.380 --> 19:51.740]  and some people are saying what you do pull a stunt on purpose no I just forget
[19:51.740 --> 19:55.620]  I'm not in the free country and I'm in a hurry getting out of my motel and I just
[19:55.620 --> 19:59.700]  stuck the produce and the grape jelly in my bag I'm sorry I'm such a criminal

[24:23.980 --> 24:27.460]  well the mainstream corporate globalist media three months ago began
[24:27.460 --> 24:32.660]  announcing that Russia was to abandon Syria to jihad Saudi Arabian Qatari
[24:32.660 --> 24:39.420]  NATO forces made up of al Qaeda and ISIS we of course reported that the
[24:39.420 --> 24:42.940]  Russians were moving more ships and weapons in that more aircraft were
[24:42.940 --> 24:46.500]  landing the Russians are building at least three airfields one of them a
[24:46.500 --> 24:53.220]  forward airbase to deliver helicopters and air support with marine forces as
[24:53.220 --> 24:57.980]  well as Russian Spetsnaz or special forces and Spetsnaz just means special
[24:57.980 --> 25:02.940]  forces period Russian both Marine and Army special forces this is an
[25:02.940 --> 25:07.260]  exclusive report in English language it is only in the Russian news as of now
[25:07.260 --> 25:13.600]  or an info wars dot com top story info wars dot com Russian Marines battle
[25:13.600 --> 25:19.740]  ISIS in Syria ISIS militants attack Russian airbase according to Russian
[25:19.740 --> 25:28.780]  media Russian Marines clash with ISIS in Syria on Sunday according to Russian
[25:28.780 --> 25:33.500]  media during the fight the Marines allegedly killed and again now they're
[25:33.500 --> 25:36.660]  gonna print the article off and bring it in here and I'm gonna be able to break
[25:36.660 --> 25:41.460]  all that down for you during the fight the Marines allegedly killed several
[25:41.460 --> 25:47.500]  militants that is migrants and captured others in a racist action I would add
[25:47.500 --> 25:50.540]  according to CNN I'm being sarcastic during the fight the Marines
[25:50.540 --> 25:54.980]  allegedly killed several of the peaceniks I'm sorry during the fight the
[25:54.980 --> 25:59.180]  Marines allegedly killed several militants and captured others after
[25:59.180 --> 26:04.300]  ISIS attempted to attack the airbase operated by Russian military reported
[26:04.300 --> 26:15.020]  the Russian news services we have links to that up on info wars dot com it is
[26:15.020 --> 26:18.460]  considered one of the most advanced aircraft in Russia's inventory with
[26:18.460 --> 26:23.620]  updated avionics and a wide array of weapons at its disposal 60 of the jets
[26:23.620 --> 26:28.540]  are planned to be delivered to Russian forces by next year again Russian
[26:28.540 --> 26:32.020]  activity the airbase ramped up Friday upon the arrival of advanced Russian
[26:32.020 --> 26:38.100]  fighter jets including four SU 300 SM flankers which are loose equivalents of
[26:38.100 --> 26:47.220]  the US Air Force FA 18 F Hornet this of course begs the question who provided
[26:47.220 --> 26:50.860]  ISIS with the kind of intelligence of right where to attack to take out the
[26:50.860 --> 26:56.260]  aircraft with live satellite feeds they were targeting the aircraft well I mean
[26:56.260 --> 27:00.180]  the Pentagon's not gonna let their little sweetie cake jihad forces actually
[27:00.180 --> 27:07.020]  get attacked are they so really amazing to see all this unfolding Russia has
[27:07.020 --> 27:11.700]  also shipped in tanks artillery and attack helicopters into Syria and has
[27:11.700 --> 27:14.940]  opened up a high-level communications the US military to ensure that no
[27:14.940 --> 27:19.100]  misunderstandings lead to conflict Moscow and Washington operated a similar
[27:19.100 --> 27:23.460]  red-phone hotliner in the Cold War a striking allegory to the current state
[27:23.460 --> 27:27.260]  of tensions between the two countries especially as a neoconservative think
[27:27.260 --> 27:32.420]  tanks rattle their sabers at Russia and as the Obama White House basically
[27:32.420 --> 27:37.860]  threatens them not to fight back against ISIS or other rebels being run by the
[27:37.860 --> 27:41.100]  West right now the Defense Department is reviewing and updating its
[27:41.100 --> 27:45.220]  contingency plans for armed conflict with Russia over the Syria conflict
[27:45.220 --> 27:52.020]  according to foreign policy magazine never before has America been so clearly
[27:52.020 --> 27:56.140]  on the wrong side ladies and gentlemen a sovereign country done nothing to us
[27:56.140 --> 28:02.780]  under five years of attack by Saudi Arabian proxy armies Saudi Arabia cut
[28:02.780 --> 28:06.740]  and dry attacked us on 9-11 our government covered that up bare minimum
[28:06.740 --> 28:11.980]  that's now come out they then had our government our media demonize an
[28:11.980 --> 28:17.500]  innocent country Iraq which was then basically brought back to the Stone Age
[28:17.500 --> 28:22.740]  and now divided into three countries Kurdistan and of course they have the
[28:22.740 --> 28:28.820]  Islamic State area in the western central area and in the south it is
[28:28.820 --> 28:34.980]  controlled by the Shiites to the east into Iran they have divided the country
[28:34.980 --> 28:38.700]  into three parts they're now openly announcing the plan to break Syria into
[28:38.700 --> 28:42.860]  three parts as well and Russia understands this is about taking their
[28:42.860 --> 28:48.740]  only warm water port there on the Mediterranean in Syria they understand
[28:48.740 --> 28:54.380]  it's part of the march towards bringing down Russia and I'm again I'm not
[28:54.380 --> 28:58.620]  saying Russia is perfect I'm not saying Russia is wonderful but Russia is not on
[28:58.620 --> 29:03.620]  an offensive Russia is not putting cancer viruses in our vaccines Russia is not
[29:03.620 --> 29:09.020]  opening our borders Russia is not funding ISIS Russia is not pushing world
[29:09.020 --> 29:13.180]  government Russia is not trying to take my guns Russia isn't on the news saying
[29:13.180 --> 29:17.860]  my kids belong to the state our criminal illegitimate government is and the
[29:17.860 --> 29:22.180]  good news is our own military and top brass have gone public and they have
[29:22.180 --> 29:26.140]  said they will not be part of openly aiding al-qaeda to bring down Syria and
[29:26.140 --> 29:30.940]  being involved in war crimes so the arrogant Harvard Ivy League globalists
[29:30.940 --> 29:34.380]  that run this country told the military we don't care we'll go with proxy
[29:34.380 --> 29:41.220]  armies and have done it anyways nakedly quadrupling down when we come back it's
[29:41.220 --> 29:46.060]  not a joke Saudi Arabia chosen to head human rights panel and the Pope is now
[29:46.060 --> 29:51.980]  back home in Cuba worshipping for now we're on the march the empires on the
[29:51.980 --> 29:58.100]  run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:59.220 --> 30:04.700]  kid Daniels info wars.com did you know that Pope Francis has strong ties to
[30:04.700 --> 30:08.060]  communism? Francis is a member of the Jesuits who developed the so-called
[30:08.060 --> 30:12.180]  liberation theology which many have labeled Christianized Marxism the other
[30:12.180 --> 30:15.700]  reason why communism and socialism has persevered for so long in Latin
[30:15.700 --> 30:19.540]  America and it's not a coincidence that Cuba's current leader Raul Castro
[30:19.540 --> 30:23.900]  raised Pope Francis for his anti-capitalist stance Castro like Francis was
[30:23.900 --> 30:27.700]  also brought up by the Jesuits starting to make sense now why Francis is
[30:27.700 --> 30:31.860]  constantly calling for carbon taxes and more government and also did you know
[30:31.860 --> 30:35.340]  the recent reconciliation between the US and Cuba was spearheaded by Pope
[30:35.340 --> 30:39.420]  Francis to the benefit of Castro Vatican researcher Leo Zagami wrote an
[30:39.420 --> 30:43.740]  excellent article on info wars.com entitled Vatican flag to fly over the
[30:43.740 --> 30:47.620]  new world order which breaks it all down Zagami wrote Barack Obama and Raul
[30:47.620 --> 30:51.580]  Castro's mandalist leftist agenda is guided and supervised by the first
[30:51.580 --> 30:54.980]  Jesuit Pope in history to help the Cubans embrace the new world order with

[33:21.060 --> 33:25.620]  organization is so well funded so organized. Lamek state linked militants
[33:25.620 --> 33:30.620]  have gained a stronger foothold in Libya seizing new economically vital areas of
[33:30.620 --> 33:35.580]  the country. The leader of ISIS in Libya is none other than Abdel Hakim
[33:35.580 --> 33:40.820]  Belhaj and of course he was armed to the teeth by NATO. A world in which there is
[33:40.820 --> 33:44.780]  the very real prospect of a new world order. The Russians say they're
[33:44.780 --> 33:49.340]  negotiating with North Korea to hold joint military exercise Kim Jong-un and
[33:49.340 --> 33:53.540]  Vladimir Putin teaming up creating an ominous alliance against the United
[33:53.540 --> 33:58.500]  States. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is aggressively opposing the
[33:58.500 --> 34:02.980]  nuclear deal that the US government is negotiating with Iran. Saudi Arabia is
[34:02.980 --> 34:06.860]  apparently prepared to allow Israeli jets into its airspace to conduct attacks
[34:06.860 --> 34:12.260]  on Iran. We have an unprecedented opportunity to build a new world order.
[34:12.260 --> 34:18.860]  I set up a foundation in Ukraine and created an important part in events now.
[34:18.860 --> 34:22.780]  Ukraine is set to receive the first tranche of international monetary fund
[34:22.780 --> 34:28.620]  to eat package we had broker to deal to transition power in Ukraine. Vladimir
[34:28.620 --> 34:35.740]  Putin is on the move. Only when this transformation is complete will we be
[34:35.740 --> 34:41.740]  able to take full measure of the opportunities presented by this new and
[34:41.740 --> 34:47.180]  involving world order. It's known as the Bilderberg group. Could their objective
[34:47.180 --> 34:58.060]  be world domination? We're back live, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much
[34:58.060 --> 35:04.700]  for joining us. The breaking news report is on infowars.com. Russian
[35:04.700 --> 35:12.140]  Marines battle ISIS in Syria. So the valiant forces of the West are attacking
[35:12.140 --> 35:16.540]  the Russians and I guess you're not patriotic if you don't support Al Qaeda.
[35:16.540 --> 35:21.300]  Controlled groups out of Saudi Arabia attacking the innocent sovereign nation
[35:21.300 --> 35:26.260]  of Syria. If you watch the mainstream television news you would believe that it
[35:26.260 --> 35:35.260]  is a war crime not to support this. That is how truly sickening all of this has
[35:35.260 --> 35:43.060]  gotten. Now before I get into the latest on election news ahead of Jesse Ventura
[35:43.060 --> 35:48.100]  joining us and the latest US news economic news what's happening with oil
[35:48.100 --> 35:53.140]  going down last week to record levels bouncing back up a bit this morning.
[35:53.140 --> 36:00.460]  Before we break that down I just wanted to let listeners know that you have now
[36:00.460 --> 36:07.780]  basically knocked a home run out of the park with the 2015 war chest operation
[36:07.780 --> 36:13.500]  that we launched last week. It raised total over a million dollars that we
[36:13.500 --> 36:16.980]  need for the satellites, the closed captioning, the equipment, the reporters,
[36:16.980 --> 36:21.420]  anybody who actually runs a news organization knows that you can't run
[36:21.420 --> 36:27.460]  a small town newspaper for a million dollars a year. But when you add a
[36:27.460 --> 36:32.580]  million dollars to the other capital we have coming in it gives us the working
[36:32.580 --> 36:36.420]  capital we need to do those new projects and to reach tens of millions of more
[36:36.420 --> 36:42.580]  people you can find out details at info wars.com forward slash affiliates the
[36:42.580 --> 36:47.100]  satellite links the feeds all of it and the next project here in the next few
[36:47.100 --> 36:54.420]  weeks and months will be aggressively you myself and we the people lobbying UHF
[36:54.420 --> 37:00.060]  VHF and local cable stations to pick up the daytime show and the nighttime news
[37:00.060 --> 37:03.780]  as well as the Sunday broadcast. There's already a lot of affiliates that are
[37:03.780 --> 37:08.820]  picking it up and we're talking to them signing them up creating a list linking
[37:08.820 --> 37:12.580]  to it and we're a very small organization that's a big job but we're
[37:12.580 --> 37:16.380]  doing the best we can so it's all ready a success I want to salute and thank all
[37:16.380 --> 37:22.380]  of you. And in this month of September we're offering specials that we've
[37:22.380 --> 37:26.580]  never offered before to make it easy for folks to support the info wars
[37:26.580 --> 37:32.540]  operation and make it what I call a 360 win. I have worked with my patriot
[37:32.540 --> 37:38.580]  supply the preeminent storeable food company for many years but for two years
[37:38.580 --> 37:43.340]  I've been negotiating to put out info wars select that's just basically has
[37:43.340 --> 37:47.340]  our sticker stuck on it because for whatever reason folks like things branded
[37:47.340 --> 37:52.100]  info wars I'll just be honest with you and it's the full selection of what my
[37:52.100 --> 37:58.060]  patriot supply has to offer at info wars store.com and you could see all the
[37:58.060 --> 38:02.780]  very same meals the same packages for just a little bit more money info wars
[38:02.780 --> 38:10.380]  select is even less but in one week info wars select will be the same price
[38:10.380 --> 38:14.180]  week to week to whatever their best specials are and we'll continue to have
[38:14.180 --> 38:21.300]  my patriot supply at info wars store.com and info wars select but basically by
[38:21.300 --> 38:26.540]  private labeling I'm contractually able to get them to offer the very lowest
[38:26.540 --> 38:31.820]  prices they're able to that they offer some of their other suppliers and
[38:31.820 --> 38:36.980]  distributors and private labelers as well so that's why we're doing this but
[38:36.980 --> 38:41.900]  I got them and I had their CEO on a week and a half ago to give us for two weeks
[38:41.900 --> 38:48.300]  the lowest price they've ever offered the highest quality non-gmo clean healthy
[38:48.300 --> 38:53.060]  high quality recently produced I mean it's produced every week as fast as they
[38:53.060 --> 38:58.300]  can produce the food fresh food that lasts for decades insurance you can eat
[38:58.300 --> 39:03.380]  in insane times like this it's insane not to have high quality storeable
[39:03.380 --> 39:07.940]  foods insurance you can eat it's insane to not be somewhat self-sufficient to
[39:07.940 --> 39:13.860]  have firearms and a water filtration communications equipment friends and
[39:13.860 --> 39:21.100]  family a backup plan a bug out plan and at the heart of all that is food this is
[39:21.100 --> 39:26.460]  the highest quality easily stored and transported a packaging you're going to
[39:26.460 --> 39:30.740]  find anywhere and your purchase supports the very tip of the spear in the
[39:30.740 --> 39:40.820]  information war so again that's 888-253-3139 to call and ask any questions
[39:40.820 --> 39:49.420]  or order over the phone or it's info or select.com or info or store.com and the
[39:49.420 --> 39:53.100]  full line of my patriot is there at the very same prices they sell it for on
[39:53.100 --> 39:57.380]  their site it's just drop ship by them and there's info or select that's going
[39:57.380 --> 40:00.740]  to be really excellent going to the future we are planning on having some
[40:00.740 --> 40:05.180]  specialty meals and specialty packs that will be different from their mainline
[40:05.180 --> 40:08.980]  products but they'll be just as good I don't want to say better than theirs
[40:08.980 --> 40:12.220]  because it is from them it'll just be a little bit different in the future as
[40:12.220 --> 40:16.180]  well but out of the gates it's the exact same thing just discounted to an even
[40:16.180 --> 40:20.380]  lower level and I I had two weeks authorization two weeks ends in about
[40:20.380 --> 40:25.020]  four days we launched it on a Thursday I'm going to try to extend it out in the
[40:25.020 --> 40:30.700]  next Monday but I may not be able to got a twist some arms to do this to bring
[40:30.700 --> 40:35.100]  you the lowest price that's how business works it's how capitalism operates so I
[40:35.100 --> 40:39.100]  would take advantage of this right now have it forget about it know you're
[40:39.100 --> 40:45.140]  secure know you're ready that's what I've done it's a no-brainer 888-253-3139

[40:51.140 --> 40:54.780]  shipping the free shipping is now ended but they're still 15% off that
[40:54.780 --> 41:00.140]  survival shield nasa and iodine x2 will sell out at current sales projections by
[41:00.140 --> 41:03.380]  the end of the week so the good news is we're funding our operation with high
[41:03.380 --> 41:07.420]  quality products and folks love it the bad news is it could be three weeks or
[41:07.420 --> 41:12.980]  longer after that till more comes in so if you want survival shield nasa and iodine
[41:12.980 --> 41:18.820]  x2 at info wars life calm now is the time the the other bad news we ordered

[41:22.940 --> 41:27.300]  powerful total body cleanses out there and so affordable it will sell out today
[41:27.300 --> 41:33.460]  deep cleanse will sell out today and it could be two to three months until we
[41:33.460 --> 41:38.500]  get more maybe longer deep cleanse was sold out for three months it was back
[41:38.500 --> 41:43.660]  in for a few weeks it is basically down to almost nothing it should be sold out

[41:47.900 --> 41:53.300]  wars life calm or info or store.com is the umbrella area also we ordered a
[41:53.300 --> 41:57.980]  time of the sleep aid knockout because I know I have trouble going to sleep
[41:57.980 --> 42:02.420]  sometimes it's just got nine ingredients known in a healthy way to give you good
[42:02.420 --> 42:08.060]  deep REM sleep it's simply amazing it is available for 1995 a bottle of
[42:08.060 --> 42:12.540]  melatonin would cost 1995 this has the regular strong dose of melatonin the
[42:12.540 --> 42:15.540]  larian root and a whole bunch of other ingredients that synergistically work
[42:15.540 --> 42:19.740]  together the good news is we ordered so much of this it's not selling out yet we
[42:19.740 --> 42:23.580]  have put in a reorder looks like we got enough for the next month or so but
[42:23.580 --> 42:27.620]  knockout is really really popular your purchases again helped fund this

[43:06.620 --> 43:11.140]  the internet as well but they're not as localized or as powerful they're more
[43:11.140 --> 43:18.940]  powerful wide-ranging across borders but not as powerful as the local effect
[43:18.940 --> 43:23.260]  we're able to see to really galvanize and energize this country in this world

[43:57.820 --> 44:01.860]  like work this is the time to not just let the corrupt government take your
[44:01.860 --> 44:07.020]  money and use it against you funding MSNBC and NPR and other channels this is
[44:07.020 --> 44:11.100]  the time to have your voice be heard and if you are listening to us on a local
[44:11.100 --> 44:16.780]  AM or FM station say what a place like Albuquerque we're on three affiliates
[44:16.780 --> 44:24.220]  in Albuquerque New Mexico 2 a.m. 2 f.m. and 1 a.m. and we're getting a huge
[44:24.220 --> 44:28.700]  response they had us on the weekend they moved us to weekdays now they're
[44:28.700 --> 44:32.580]  talking about expanding us and airing us again at night that's how popular the
[44:32.580 --> 44:38.540]  show is we need folks to then take action who are listeners in Albuquerque and
[44:38.540 --> 44:43.380]  put up billboards this is what it's all about ladies and gentlemen this is how
[44:43.380 --> 44:47.140]  the people power can crush the globalist okay I'm done I'm done ranting
[44:47.140 --> 44:54.780]  about that I want to be clear when I say this I have never been anti-Catholic
[44:54.780 --> 45:01.340]  I'm a Christian I don't judge people if I do judge people I don't judge their
[45:01.340 --> 45:05.860]  soul I simply judge whether I think they're trustworthy and good people or
[45:05.860 --> 45:15.540]  not and it was Christ who said you judge a tree by its fruits and the
[45:15.540 --> 45:19.780]  Catholics I've known throughout my life are hard-working trustworthy good fun
[45:19.780 --> 45:26.900]  people who stand up against abortion who stand up against globalism who stand
[45:26.900 --> 45:33.420]  up against tyranny in fact I've got to say probably half the people at the
[45:33.420 --> 45:38.020]  grassroots that I knew in Austin fighting gun control land grabs abortion
[45:38.020 --> 45:43.820]  were Catholics so I turned around I had a pretty good view of Catholics because
[45:43.820 --> 45:47.220]  of that so I'm not judging the Catholic people because I judge a tree by its
[45:47.220 --> 45:54.780]  fruits past popes basically sounded about a hundred degrees different not a
[45:54.780 --> 46:00.500]  hundred and eighty but about a hundred degrees about 60% different than this
[46:00.500 --> 46:05.620]  current pope so you've got to either say if you're a good Catholic out there to
[46:05.620 --> 46:10.140]  use that famous term where the last three or four popes or five popes or ten
[46:10.140 --> 46:17.180]  popes were were they bad or is this guy good because this guy is massively
[46:17.180 --> 46:21.140]  different than classical Catholic doctrine I'm not a Catholic but I've
[46:21.140 --> 46:25.740]  looked at it I've researched it I mean the last few popes were on at least on
[46:25.740 --> 46:31.740]  the surface anti-communist this guy goes to the main square under the Shagwa
[46:31.740 --> 46:37.780]  Vara statue and is you know presented with crucifix from Raul Castro will put
[46:37.780 --> 46:41.700]  you in jail if you're a Christian in Cuba they've arrested a whole bunch of
[46:41.700 --> 46:47.300]  people as well and there's no criticism from him of the crushing of free speech
[46:47.300 --> 46:51.380]  then he says you shouldn't have a car you shouldn't have air conditioning we
[46:51.380 --> 46:57.500]  heard that from Obama when he went to Africa he says that so this is a guy
[46:57.500 --> 47:01.900]  about being poor this is a guy about austerity this is a guy about a gen
[47:01.900 --> 47:07.580]  of 21 that is a plan to impoverish the world to make us politically controllable
[47:07.580 --> 47:13.900]  for social engineering on the surface of the treaty this is all admitted and he
[47:13.900 --> 47:20.860]  sells it as if it's Christ like Christ being humble well the Bible also talks
[47:20.860 --> 47:24.380]  about following God's commandments and being prosperous so you can be self
[47:24.380 --> 47:29.820]  sufficient and help other people so it is a communist liberation theology Ford
[47:29.820 --> 47:34.900]  Foundation program about a hundred years old created by the Jesuits picked up by
[47:34.900 --> 47:43.940]  the Ford Foundation on record that has financed communism all over the world
[47:43.940 --> 47:53.420]  and we have a above-the-law Jesuit Pope promoting classical hardcore communism
[47:53.420 --> 47:58.700]  while he pushes the EU super state and doesn't say a word against that and now
[47:58.700 --> 48:03.740]  he's pushing carbon taxes and world government he's here getting DC lined
[48:03.740 --> 48:10.580]  up in September then he goes to Africa and other countries and then he's going
[48:10.580 --> 48:19.780]  to Europe in December to sell a planetary expansion of the EU and open
[48:19.780 --> 48:26.340]  world government so this pope by every yardstick even if he isn't the false
[48:26.340 --> 48:33.620]  prophet of revelations and Daniel and Ezekiel he fits the bill he I mean like
[48:33.620 --> 48:40.460]  a key goes in a lock and the door opens I mean this key opens the door so if he's
[48:40.460 --> 48:52.140]  not the devil's henchman he sure is trying and you'd have to be blind not to
[48:52.140 --> 48:56.540]  see that whether you believe in the devil or not what this guy is doing is
[48:56.540 --> 49:00.660]  manifesting what's in revelation so he's following it as a blueprint at least
[49:00.660 --> 49:06.860]  bare minimum I mean it's happening you can't deny I've been sitting there
[49:06.860 --> 49:09.540]  arguing with atheists before about skull and bones Mahemian Grove and Satan
[49:09.540 --> 49:12.820]  worship they go I don't believe in the devil and I go fine I get you don't
[49:12.820 --> 49:16.900]  believe in spiritualism or anything above your senses I understand you think
[49:16.900 --> 49:20.900]  you're following the scientific method there even though Einstein and folks said
[49:20.900 --> 49:25.100]  it made them believe in God the more he learned what I'm saying to you is are
[49:25.100 --> 49:29.940]  there pygmies in New Guinea or or are there pygmies are in Central Africa are
[49:29.940 --> 49:35.300]  there are there Islanders in New Guinea that that kill people and shrink their
[49:35.300 --> 49:39.340]  heads the answer is yes doesn't mean you believe in head shrinking it's going on
[49:39.340 --> 49:42.740]  like did the Aztecs cut people's hearts out yes they did doesn't mean you don't
[49:42.740 --> 49:47.260]  believe in their God the flying serpent the point is did they do it yes they did
[49:47.260 --> 49:53.540]  it so that's the issue here this is world government this is a cultism this
[49:53.540 --> 50:00.460]  is a takeover this is one world religion being pushed by this papa and it's
[50:00.460 --> 50:04.380]  unprecedented I mean look at these headlines dissidents arrested as Pope
[50:04.380 --> 50:08.420]  Francis celebrates his first mass in Cuba Pope Francis is wrong about air
[50:08.420 --> 50:13.060]  conditioning national review once it basically banned Pope visit will
[50:13.060 --> 50:18.340]  produce largest security operation US history Washington Post why why pay for
[50:18.340 --> 50:22.100]  it yourself with all the trillions you've got or your man of the people we
[50:22.100 --> 50:27.460]  don't need this giant half the city shut down huge circuses popemobiles all of
[50:27.460 --> 50:33.340]  it no we have a separation of church and state there should not be any federal
[50:33.340 --> 50:38.660]  funding to protect this guy and I don't mean him any harm it's just a joke this
[50:38.660 --> 50:42.460]  filthy rich guy that lectures me that I got air conditioning and then I want my
[50:42.460 --> 50:46.740]  employees to get paid more and I want prosperity tells me I'm a devil as he
[50:46.740 --> 50:52.220]  pushes Rockefeller eugenics garbage I mean I wish this pope would crawl back
[50:52.220 --> 50:56.860]  to his communist Jesuits seminary that he crawls out from under get out of my
[50:56.860 --> 51:02.740]  country and you're not my king this hour of GCN brought to you by let's say

[54:42.620 --> 54:47.020]  mainstream media backing him saying how great he is when you notice the mainstream
[54:47.020 --> 54:51.060]  media was savagely attacking the Catholic Church at every angle until this
[54:51.060 --> 54:57.300]  point to blackmail the church that had its own problems that we exposed into
[54:57.300 --> 55:04.380]  going along with the agenda and you can search Catholic Church blackmailed
[55:04.380 --> 55:10.300]  pedophile scandal rat singer you'll get London Guardian other publications from
[55:10.300 --> 55:15.180]  three years ago right before the old pope ran off to Gandalf Castle I'm not
[55:15.180 --> 55:20.620]  kidding it's called Gandalf Lord of the Rings got that name from it not the
[55:20.620 --> 55:26.340]  other way around and he runs off to Gandalf Castle and they put in this new
[55:26.340 --> 55:33.180]  guy we should be discussing the fact that the Vatican is now run by globalist
[55:33.180 --> 55:37.020]  100% there's the headline London Guardian they found it quick papal
[55:37.020 --> 55:43.460]  resignation linked to inquiry into Vatican gay officials blackmail or
[55:43.460 --> 55:51.100]  corruption Catholics respond to the Vatican's gay lobby Al Jazeera and so
[55:51.100 --> 55:56.100]  they blackmailed the church by having their people infiltrate it set up their
[55:56.100 --> 56:03.580]  operation just like Congress just like Sandusky and Penn State until it's so
[56:03.580 --> 56:10.220]  evil it's so big it's so horrible that it's too big to fail and then it just
[56:10.220 --> 56:14.060]  gets absorbed and starts promoting world government openly and clearly the
[56:14.060 --> 56:17.260]  Catholic Church has been degenerating and rotting and falling apart for a
[56:17.260 --> 56:20.620]  long time Catholics are always mad at me for saying it's just now being taken
[56:20.620 --> 56:24.860]  over I'm not a Catholic scholar compared to the general public I mean I'm a
[56:24.860 --> 56:28.100]  rocket scientist I mean I've studied it quite a bit but not compared to devout
[56:28.100 --> 56:32.740]  conservative Catholics I understand that but I mean it's now just incredibly
[56:32.740 --> 56:39.620]  obvious it's incredibly insane and I get mad when Obama's or Bush would shut
[56:39.620 --> 56:43.860]  down half of Austin or half of Dallas or Clinton getting a haircut remember back
[56:43.860 --> 56:48.460]  then having all the air traffic stopped for an hour they're talking about
[56:48.460 --> 56:52.860]  shutting airports down you know when the Saudi King goes to France they'll
[56:52.860 --> 56:56.780]  shut down 20 miles of the south of France so he doesn't have to see anybody
[56:56.780 --> 57:03.780]  on the beach for him and his family up and down the coast that's sick to shut
[57:03.780 --> 57:12.620]  down public beaches so some degenerate scumbag like the Saudi King I'm sick of
[57:12.620 --> 57:15.860]  the Pope and the Saudi King and the Queen of England and just all of these
[57:15.860 --> 57:26.900]  anachronisms all of these jokes said it enraged locals when they shut down the
[57:26.900 --> 57:32.020]  beaches for him oh you absolutely I mean just talk about being dominated it's up

[57:47.140 --> 57:51.460]  incredible abject ignorance you know I'm not saying nuke North Korea but actually
[57:51.460 --> 57:55.220]  I could see nuking them their government itself that's a pure evil I
[57:55.220 --> 58:00.420]  wouldn't want to start nuclear wars I wouldn't do it but this video is nothing
[58:00.420 --> 58:03.700]  compared to them saying put all gun owners in forced labor camps arrest

[01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:08.580]  Alex Jones had another run-in with the TSA after agent searched his bag and
[01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:11.700]  found a jar of grape jelly Jones said he went through the airport body scanner
[01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:15.300]  and a physical pat down but the TSA agents insisted upon searching his bags
[01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:18.780]  after finding the jar of grape jelly the agents told Jones he was lucky they
[01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:22.900]  would still allow him to fly after such a violation Jones recapped on the Sunday
[01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:27.180]  show they searched me for 35 minutes and I barely made my plane and they got such
[01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:30.540]  enjoyment out of it meanwhile last week federal air marshals were under
[01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:34.100]  investigation for filming sex with a prostitute while on duty the two air
[01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:37.580]  marshals based in Chicago allegedly used government-issued phones to record
[01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:40.380]  their own sexual encounters with the prostitute and then shared them on their
[01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:43.460]  personal email accounts which they connected to their work phones according
[01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:47.300]  to the TSA and remember TSA demands the highest standards of integrity and
[01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:50.580]  professionalism let's hope if there's a hijacking and air marshals are aboard

[01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:06.940]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the

[01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:20.460]  every month or so he joins us he's got his own TV show of course he's a former
[01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:27.140]  governor a mayor talk show host Jesse Ventura kicked off MSNBC because he
[01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:31.340]  wouldn't go along with the Iraq war that's one of the reasons I admire him
[01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:35.820]  Jesse Ventura is our guest he's friends with Donald Trump but disagrees with him
[01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:39.980]  on immigration I agree with Donald Trump on immigration so we'll have a lively

[01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:07.620]  we have links to it up on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com I want to
[01:09:07.620 --> 01:09:13.300]  cover the waterfront with him though we've got the Pope coming to the United
[01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:19.940]  States promoting carbon taxes saying don't have air conditioning that you
[01:09:19.940 --> 01:09:25.580]  know the earth can't handle us all living well teaming up with Obama why are
[01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:31.540]  we paying for what the Associated Press calls the largest security operation in
[01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:36.220]  US history I'm not anti-catholic but at the same time I do not think the Pope
[01:09:36.220 --> 01:09:40.060]  speaks for God what about folks that don't believe in God I mean why do they
[01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:44.860]  have to pay for a foreign head of state who's got trillions of dollars or
[01:09:44.860 --> 01:09:50.580]  euros in the Catholic you know banks why are we doing this and I'm not trying
[01:09:50.580 --> 01:09:54.500]  to bait you into a Catholic bashing fest here Governor Ventura but just
[01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:59.620]  throwing you a wild card here out of the gates what do you make of this well
[01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:05.700]  obviously we don't want nothing to happen to him on our watch do we no I
[01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:10.780]  hear that but but still the same time you know that that I'd like to think that
[01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:15.660]  would be the reason is that they want to make sure that the Pope is safe here and
[01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:20.500]  and that he gets out of the country in one piece I suppose I don't know you
[01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:25.220]  know after all we're a lockdown nation Alex you know that there's a terrorist
[01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:29.780]  behind every tree out there and you know it's called keeping everything safe
[01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:34.460]  keeping things safe costs a lot of money you're being sarcastic of course
[01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:38.260]  you're being tongue-in-cheek you think so
[01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:46.100]  no I mean that's the only logical reason I can come up with is that they they
[01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:50.540]  feel that it they they need to keep the Pope as safe as possible and I I hope
[01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:55.020]  that nothing happens to him I like this pope and you know I'm ready to go out
[01:10:55.020 --> 01:11:00.860]  and see him with a big sign atheists for the Pope all right you know what you
[01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:05.900]  know what why do you like this pop cuz you likes open borders no I like this
[01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:13.140]  Pope because he said I can go to heaven oh really and and on what subject was
[01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:19.420]  that the Pope said atheists can go to heaven well I understand that you were
[01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:25.020]  made to go and I love it I have a chance now you know because he said he's the
[01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:29.260]  highest there is and he says that I can go well here's a person here's why I
[01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:32.860]  stand on the whole atheist deal I get people that can say hey I don't believe
[01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:37.740]  an imaginary guy in the sky I believe in science I believe one I can empirically
[01:11:37.740 --> 01:11:43.180]  see separately though humans only see a tiny spectrum of reality they've proven
[01:11:43.180 --> 01:11:46.500]  dark matter they've proven other dimensions so many scientists that were
[01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:50.420]  atheists get into the genetic engineering realm and go my god something
[01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:55.340]  made this most scientists do not believe in evolutionary theory now but it's its
[01:11:55.340 --> 01:11:59.940]  own religion governor well but then again what about these guys they just
[01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:06.580]  found lately this latest ancient humanoid in Africa yeah they walked up
[01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:19.620]  right they buried their dad cripy looked like a monkey to me
[01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:23.220]  my neighbor I said he looked pretty different than me but yet he looked
[01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:29.140]  humanoid half monkey and he walked up right he buried his dad they and all
[01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:34.180]  this stuff I mean you know let's remember something Alex that whenever man
[01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:42.980]  cannot explain something it's real easy then to attribute it to God my only
[01:12:42.980 --> 01:12:49.020]  issue is so many atheists and you're not like this but so many atheists hate
[01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:55.380]  people that are religious and act like there's a lot of you see Alex atheists
[01:12:55.380 --> 01:13:01.220]  don't hate anybody we just don't believe in that there's a magical person you
[01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:07.700]  talk to and you know that we don't hate nobody you can believe what you want to
[01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:13.140]  believe if you want to go worship a tree just don't force it on to me well I
[01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:18.100]  agree don't force me believe in this don't force me to pay for abortion and
[01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:24.420]  don't force me to pay for the pope well if the leader of Russia came here would
[01:13:24.420 --> 01:13:28.060]  we provide security for him I don't think it needs to be the biggest security in
[01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:31.900]  history no and that's a foreign leader not a religious leader we have a
[01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:37.420]  separation of church the state excuse me there's more Catholics in the world
[01:13:37.420 --> 01:13:41.380]  than there probably is in one country no absolutely there's a there's a probably
[01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:46.860]  800 million Catholics or more you know I see I understand I having been in
[01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:51.740]  government Alex I understand the pomp and circumstance and I understand what
[01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:56.580]  they do and why they do it and it's called just proper respect and it's this
[01:13:56.580 --> 01:14:01.980]  and that now if you want to well then I got one for you Alex mm-hmm why do
[01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:06.900]  churches get by tax-free because Congress shall make no law established
[01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:10.380]  respecting establishment of religion or prohibit the free exercise thereof
[01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:16.020]  Congress has no jurisdiction no but they get the same benefits that I get
[01:14:16.020 --> 01:14:22.300]  I'm an atheist I have to pay more yet the church gets its streets plowed the
[01:14:22.300 --> 01:14:26.500]  church gets by your protection the church gets police protection doesn't
[01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:31.700]  pay a thing for it they don't pay taxes we should all be treated equally wait
[01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:35.220]  sounds like you're talking about illegal aliens now and then you've got these
[01:14:35.220 --> 01:14:39.860]  guys out there that claim to heal people and all that they call themselves a
[01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:44.740]  church and it's done strictly to avoid being taxed on anything I think all
[01:14:44.740 --> 01:14:50.060]  churches should be taxed well and it even says in the Bible Jesus said let's
[01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:55.700]  Caesar have what Caesar's well that was a question of taxation of the church and
[01:14:55.700 --> 01:14:59.900]  he was saying clearly that that's Caesar's currency whose face is on it so
[01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:04.060]  that's his system so I get what you're saying there but in our system as an
[01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:08.940]  atheist why should churches not play property taxes they receive all the
[01:15:08.940 --> 01:15:12.660]  benefits how come I have to put sure let me answer the question for you
[01:15:12.660 --> 01:15:18.020]  because Thomas Jefferson of the left love so much came up with the idea of
[01:15:18.020 --> 01:15:22.700]  separation of church and state that means as an individual you can say or do
[01:15:22.700 --> 01:15:25.620]  whatever you want in government buildings or government finance
[01:15:25.620 --> 01:15:29.820]  facilities like public schools but there cannot be an official religion of the
[01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:34.500]  state or one that the state picks discriminatorily and that Congress has
[01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:38.620]  no authority and can make no law respecting the establishment of
[01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:42.260]  religion or prohibiting the free exercise there are nothing to do with
[01:15:42.260 --> 01:15:49.780]  taxing them they're getting services Alex that I'm paying for what about the
[01:15:49.780 --> 01:15:53.380]  illegals the illegals get anchor babies for free the illegals get all these
[01:15:53.380 --> 01:15:58.580]  services you're all for that Alex come on you but now you're straight the
[01:15:58.580 --> 01:16:03.700]  illegals get all the things illegals also pay taxes and don't file tax returns
[01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:07.140]  how about that how about Congress shall make no law respected the
[01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:13.140]  establishment of anger babies you want to benefit religion if you desire but
[01:16:13.140 --> 01:16:17.780]  take it the route that if you're gonna use it on one hand you have to use it
[01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:21.340]  on the other hand too well I think you've got a really good point being is
[01:16:21.340 --> 01:16:25.980]  how come I have to pay you're claiming you shouldn't have to pay for the pope
[01:16:25.980 --> 01:16:30.420]  to be here I agree I'm saying well how come I have to pay more taxes because
[01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:33.820]  churches don't well it's obviously not fair from any perspective and let's just
[01:16:33.820 --> 01:16:37.300]  be clear because I don't really talk about religion with you a lot there is
[01:16:37.300 --> 01:16:41.620]  no one more critical of establishment churches and religions their political
[01:16:41.620 --> 01:16:47.220]  whorehouses their frauds their jokes their con men most of them who want to
[01:16:47.220 --> 01:16:51.580]  be fake leaders who sit there and manipulate people and basically sell
[01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:56.820]  the equivalent of indulgences to do it tax-free and I don't like that they're
[01:16:56.820 --> 01:17:01.740]  touched them because they're religion because it's for me or the or the press
[01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:05.140]  or the people's right to assemble it's the first amendment and I think it's
[01:17:05.140 --> 01:17:11.700]  it's a good thing the problem is churches now are 501c3 they're now
[01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:15.780]  charities governor so they're not even really churches they're more than that
[01:17:15.780 --> 01:17:22.460]  they're the whole thing of religion is nothing but a massive business why and
[01:17:22.460 --> 01:17:27.140]  so why shouldn't they be held to the corporate standards they're no
[01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:31.860]  different religions no different than a corporation well I agree with you that
[01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:35.940]  churches should have to pay for local services and in most cases they do pay
[01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:41.940]  the local taxes for fire and police and they don't they don't they're off
[01:17:41.940 --> 01:17:48.980]  limits you can't tax religion why not you know you've been a mayor and a
[01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:52.540]  governor and I don't know Minnesota laws but and I defer to your knowledge on
[01:17:52.540 --> 01:17:56.980]  this but I believe a lot of states the churches do have to pay the fire fees
[01:17:56.980 --> 01:18:00.620]  and the property taxes and the rest of it to a certain extent but I agree with
[01:18:00.620 --> 01:18:04.900]  you check up on that before you make that statement well I know it very
[01:18:04.900 --> 01:18:08.980]  state-to-state got a property taxes and churches don't pay property I know in a
[01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:12.420]  lot of states they don't or they pay amended lower levels but listen I agree
[01:18:12.420 --> 01:18:18.140]  with you that Congress the feds have no business wait and churches when they get
[01:18:18.140 --> 01:18:24.460]  this break they also get the benefit of being political because the same churches
[01:18:24.460 --> 01:18:30.300]  that pay no taxes put signs up that marriages between a man and a woman but
[01:18:30.300 --> 01:18:35.300]  that's my next point discrimination yet they don't pay their end of the law see
[01:18:35.300 --> 01:18:41.020]  my belief is if you don't pay taxes then you have no right to participate in the
[01:18:41.020 --> 01:18:46.580]  government system well I know this churches have a First Amendment right
[01:18:46.580 --> 01:18:50.340]  to have their views and I don't agree that's a political statement I am that
[01:18:50.340 --> 01:18:53.420]  sure but I don't think that's a political statement but I don't want to get
[01:18:53.420 --> 01:18:58.220]  too far fielders and we agree on a lot of stuff we disagree on some things my
[01:18:58.220 --> 01:19:02.420]  problem is yes he is that they're turning the state and environmentalism and
[01:19:02.420 --> 01:19:06.500]  all this other stuff into religions as well it's not just the Christians or
[01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:10.980]  other religious groups classically you know what I learned Alex to though you
[01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:19.700]  gotta check up on Horace what about Horace Horace was Jesus 70 years 700
[01:19:19.700 --> 01:19:26.980]  years before Jesus well I do know that they know his background's identical he
[01:19:26.980 --> 01:19:32.260]  was born of a virgin he lived the 33 he was a carpenter it's the entire same
[01:19:32.260 --> 01:19:38.380]  biography of a guy a character named Horace who was an Egyptian religious
[01:19:38.380 --> 01:19:42.620]  figure Horace was a god years before Christ sure you're saying you're saying
[01:19:42.620 --> 01:19:47.580]  the Bible is plagiarized no I'm just saying that you might want to check out
[01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:51.860]  that there's two people with the same there's two people that existed
[01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:56.620]  allegedly no no I know about that guys years apart with the same biography I
[01:19:56.620 --> 01:19:59.780]  mean I know about that guys time in it I mean I wasn't part of it but I'm in the

[01:24:35.060 --> 01:24:39.300]  and more but I don't want to get off into a debate it makes for good radio we
[01:24:39.300 --> 01:24:46.340]  have a lot of listeners that are Christians agnostics animus atheist
[01:24:46.340 --> 01:24:50.140]  whatever I know there are a lot of atheists and people out there that do
[01:24:50.140 --> 01:24:54.940]  fight the New World Order who do fight globalism who want to be free I don't
[01:24:54.940 --> 01:24:58.540]  think somebody's bad if they don't believe in God I think somebody's bad if
[01:24:58.540 --> 01:25:04.940]  they go out and push tyranny on people but that said what about how under
[01:25:04.940 --> 01:25:09.740]  Obama they've not issued one tax exemption well they've issued one in the
[01:25:09.740 --> 01:25:13.220]  last six years to a conservative or libertarian group but they've issued
[01:25:13.220 --> 01:25:17.740]  thousands of the Democrats what about lowest learner and the IRS targeting
[01:25:17.740 --> 01:25:21.260]  churches targeting people when of course they're being political the
[01:25:21.260 --> 01:25:25.980]  Democrats openly recruit and operate out of churches politically and I'm
[01:25:25.980 --> 01:25:30.060]  saying Jesse if Congress can make no law respecting the establishment of
[01:25:30.060 --> 01:25:33.940]  religion or prohibit the free exercise thereof you can say our religion is
[01:25:33.940 --> 01:25:37.700]  whatever you want I mean look at the Scientologist it doesn't mean we have
[01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:41.180]  to agree with it it's just that you've got the right maybe we need the church
[01:25:41.180 --> 01:25:45.540]  to Jesse Ventura I mean what would the church to Jesse Ventura be and let me
[01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:49.660]  make it clear Alex the only offense I took was when you said that atheists
[01:25:49.660 --> 01:25:56.340]  hate this that we don't atheists don't hate anybody we simply don't believe
[01:25:56.340 --> 01:26:01.980]  that there's a supreme being that that we talk to because I've never spoken to
[01:26:01.980 --> 01:26:06.820]  him and you know I'm not saying I just don't believe but we don't hate anybody
[01:26:06.820 --> 01:26:12.380]  you can be an atheist and love your fellow man trust me especially when you
[01:26:12.380 --> 01:26:17.220]  look at it from most people that have religious faith beliefs beliefs they're
[01:26:17.220 --> 01:26:22.100]  going to somewhere else when they're done here atheists we don't necessarily
[01:26:22.100 --> 01:26:27.380]  believe that so we want to make the most about of being here and why would we
[01:26:27.380 --> 01:26:32.020]  want to make people angry or hurt or hate people when we kind of look at this
[01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:36.500]  is the shot you got make the best of it well I'm all against social engineering
[01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:41.060]  and control and so I get the arguments and then I'll quit talking about this
[01:26:41.060 --> 01:26:44.620]  and shift here's some other subjects yeah let's just gears but I just want to
[01:26:44.620 --> 01:26:50.980]  know atheists love people too listen it is the ultimate form of mind control to
[01:26:50.980 --> 01:26:55.180]  say do what I say or you'll be killed or you'll be tortured after you die then
[01:26:55.180 --> 01:26:59.780]  you think you can't escape it is a great social control tool what man has done
[01:26:59.780 --> 01:27:03.260]  with religion I absolutely agree with you and religion has been used to
[01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:10.180]  absolutely enslave people and we'll let that there let's move on well I've got a
[01:27:10.180 --> 01:27:12.980]  bunch of questions I've got a bunch of different topics I want to fire out at
[01:27:12.980 --> 01:27:18.980]  you all right well but first off what else is on your radar screen well not
[01:27:18.980 --> 01:27:24.060]  you know like I said October 20th I go in front of the court of appeals the
[01:27:24.060 --> 01:27:29.100]  a circuit court of appeals on the on the American sniper and you know they're
[01:27:29.100 --> 01:27:35.260]  appealing and trying to get unjust enrichment overturned so that that way
[01:27:35.260 --> 01:27:40.980]  the media can go out to fame anybody and profit from it and that the person
[01:27:40.980 --> 01:27:46.820]  defamed will not be able to get any of those profits even though you like in
[01:27:46.820 --> 01:27:52.980]  the case of the Chris Kyle book that that book all had a presale of 4,000 when
[01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:58.220]  he went on national TV and lied about me and that story about me it jumped a
[01:27:58.220 --> 01:28:05.720]  hundred thousand in one day one day and that's the point they used the
[01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:09.620]  defamation and what they want to do is use the defamation to be able to make
[01:28:09.620 --> 01:28:13.140]  money and it will become a business for them they can pay off a little
[01:28:13.140 --> 01:28:18.620]  defamation and make millions on the back end so they could publish a book
[01:28:18.620 --> 01:28:23.820]  saying that I basically married the Loch Ness monster and had 14 goblin babies
[01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:29.700]  it won't matter that it's not true there I consume and even win but I can't get
[01:28:29.700 --> 01:28:33.180]  them on unjust enrichment so they make a hundred million dollars and pay me a
[01:28:33.180 --> 01:28:37.500]  million and get to basically lie well and they ain't gonna pay you even a
[01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:43.540]  million rest assured on that they just get because my actual defamation award
[01:28:43.540 --> 01:28:49.340]  is only a half a million and then they gave me 1.3 on unjust enrichment that
[01:28:49.340 --> 01:28:53.900]  they you know they had made the estate had made over six million dollars just on
[01:28:53.900 --> 01:28:58.420]  the book and the book publisher has made 40 million on the book or more but how
[01:28:58.420 --> 01:29:03.180]  much since the film came out oh well that ain't part of mine because I wasn't
[01:29:03.180 --> 01:29:06.460]  in the film but they oh yeah they've met the film made three or four hundred
[01:29:06.460 --> 01:29:09.220]  million were they intending to put you in the film
[01:29:09.220 --> 01:29:14.940]  ah there's no way to know all I know is that had I not gone to court you can
[01:29:14.940 --> 01:29:20.100]  bet I would have been in there I had to go to court to stop this lie from being
[01:29:20.100 --> 01:29:24.420]  in the film because it was interesting during the trial they were trying to
[01:29:24.420 --> 01:29:28.260]  diminish my importance to the book now they obviously felt they were gonna lose
[01:29:28.260 --> 01:29:33.780]  but they wanted to diminish the award so the other attorney said Mr. Ventura
[01:29:33.780 --> 01:29:37.140]  wouldn't even call me governor he said Mr. Ventura would it would it surprise
[01:29:37.140 --> 01:29:41.420]  you to know that you're not in the original the first screenplay has been
[01:29:41.420 --> 01:29:45.100]  written and you're not in it and I looked at him in front of the jury and I
[01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:50.500]  said no that doesn't surprise me at all I said we my attorneys have said stay
[01:29:50.500 --> 01:29:55.420]  there story we come back now I'm gonna break Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[01:29:55.420 --> 01:29:57.780]  network
[01:29:59.260 --> 01:30:04.700]  okay Daniels info wars.com did you know that Pope Francis has strong ties to
[01:30:04.700 --> 01:30:08.060]  communism Francis is a member of the Jesuits who developed the so-called
[01:30:08.060 --> 01:30:12.060]  liberation theology which many have labeled Christianized Marxism they're
[01:30:12.060 --> 01:30:15.700]  the reason why communism and socialism has persevered for so long in Latin
[01:30:15.700 --> 01:30:19.540]  America and it's not a coincidence that Cuba's current leader Ryle Castro
[01:30:19.540 --> 01:30:23.180]  praised Pope Francis for his anti-capitalist stance Castro like
[01:30:23.180 --> 01:30:26.860]  Francis was also brought up by the Jesuits starting to make sense now why
[01:30:26.860 --> 01:30:31.620]  Francis is constantly calling for carbon taxes and more government and also did
[01:30:31.620 --> 01:30:34.780]  you know the recent reconciliation between the US and Cuba was spearheaded
[01:30:34.780 --> 01:30:39.060]  by Pope Francis to the benefit of Castro Vatican researcher Leo Zagami
[01:30:39.060 --> 01:30:43.300]  wrote an excellent article on info wars.com entitled Vatican flag to fly
[01:30:43.300 --> 01:30:47.420]  over the New World Order which breaks it all down Zagami wrote Rock Obama and
[01:30:47.420 --> 01:30:51.580]  Raul Castro's Mundialist leftist agenda is guided and supervised by the first
[01:30:51.580 --> 01:30:54.980]  Jesuit Pope in history to help the Cubans embrace the New World Order with

[01:33:31.100 --> 01:33:43.940]  now I wanted to get Jesse Ventura's take on this because back on August 24th
[01:33:43.940 --> 01:33:49.620]  about a month ago Joe Biggs filed a detailed report for info wars nightly
[01:33:49.620 --> 01:33:54.420]  news detailing the fact that the State Department and Hillary Clinton and
[01:33:54.420 --> 01:34:00.820]  others had basically ordered the US military to let the Afghan soldiers and
[01:34:00.820 --> 01:34:05.620]  others abuse children and Joe Biggs filed the report we're gonna play a clip of
[01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:09.060]  it in a moment and then get Governor Ventura's take on it and then get a
[01:34:09.060 --> 01:34:13.380]  brief take on it from Joe Biggs but there it is exclusive Hillary Clinton
[01:34:13.380 --> 01:34:17.220]  sanctioned child rape in Afghanistan document show Clinton State Department
[01:34:17.220 --> 01:34:20.900]  told troops to ignore Afghan pedophilia and here's the headline of the New York
[01:34:20.900 --> 01:34:26.740]  Times yesterday US soldiers told to ignore sexual abuse of boys by Afghan
[01:34:26.740 --> 01:34:31.740]  allies and this goes back to what are we doing funding al-Qaeda and ISIS all
[01:34:31.740 --> 01:34:36.300]  over the world and now it's even come out that our government's funding it the
[01:34:36.300 --> 01:34:39.540]  former head of defense intelligence went public a month ago the deputy head of
[01:34:39.540 --> 01:34:44.620]  the CIA went public two weeks ago on CBS News I want to ask Governor Ventura does
[01:34:44.620 --> 01:34:47.580]  this mean the military's you know trying to do the right thing and this is very
[01:34:47.580 --> 01:34:52.220]  exciting but here's a clip from the report with Joe Biggs last month here
[01:34:52.220 --> 01:34:56.940]  in British Joe Biggs here with info wars.com now last week an article came
[01:34:56.940 --> 01:35:01.660]  out in the Daily Mail titled decorated green beret is kicked out of US Army
[01:35:01.660 --> 01:35:06.540]  Special Forces after shoving Afghan police commander who raped boy who was
[01:35:06.540 --> 01:35:11.420]  12 years old and then beat up his mother when she reported the crime to higher
[01:35:11.420 --> 01:35:16.620]  ups and now you have a decorated soldier who was with the US Army Special
[01:35:16.620 --> 01:35:21.780]  Forces for 11 years he is now being kicked out after he stood up for a young
[01:35:21.780 --> 01:35:27.580]  rape victim and his mother who were beaten by this rogue police commander now
[01:35:27.580 --> 01:35:31.780]  word got out to Sergeant First Class Martland that one of the police
[01:35:31.780 --> 01:35:36.420]  commanders that he had trained had sexually assaulted a boy and hit his
[01:35:36.420 --> 01:35:41.340]  mother decided to take and then Joe goes into his military contact saying yes
[01:35:41.340 --> 01:35:45.620]  this is going on yes this is happening that's the exclusive portion of it they
[01:35:45.620 --> 01:35:50.540]  have the US Army wearing high heels and sensitivity training now they're making
[01:35:50.540 --> 01:35:54.260]  of this you have this huge political war zone we never hear that the West is
[01:35:54.260 --> 01:35:58.420]  what gave us all these inclusive freedoms are forbearers but then Europe
[01:35:58.420 --> 01:36:03.500]  German women are told wear long skirts it'll upset the quote migrants so I
[01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:07.940]  wanted to get Jesse Ventura's take on this I mean I know you're a libertarian
[01:36:07.940 --> 01:36:11.100]  at heart I guess I'm speaking for you or you can tell me what you would
[01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:15.780]  classify yourself as Governor Ventura but what do you make of the millions of
[01:36:15.780 --> 01:36:19.940]  refugees and I know the West destabilized it but Saudi Arabia won't take one
[01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:24.820]  person these other countries won't take one we've got floods of these refugees
[01:36:24.820 --> 01:36:29.460]  coming in and then a lot of them are radicalized former ISIS fighters and
[01:36:29.460 --> 01:36:34.100]  the left is telling us we've got to adopt their culture whether it be the
[01:36:34.100 --> 01:36:39.220]  radical elements of it raping women pedophilia what is your view on the
[01:36:39.220 --> 01:36:44.780]  situation well my view on the situation is we would never be in any of this if
[01:36:44.780 --> 01:36:51.700]  we hadn't have responded like we did to 9-11 by invading Iraq we destabilized
[01:36:51.700 --> 01:36:59.060]  the entire region you now don't know who runs anything over there it's 10 times
[01:36:59.060 --> 01:37:04.740]  worse than it's ever been and ultimately we have to look in the mirror and bear
[01:37:04.740 --> 01:37:10.500]  some responsibility for it because we went over there and started the Iraq
[01:37:10.500 --> 01:37:15.260]  war and this is the end result to the majority of that even though it also
[01:37:15.260 --> 01:37:20.740]  feels look at Afghanistan when the Taliban had Afghanistan the world's
[01:37:20.740 --> 01:37:25.860]  heroin that ground to a halt when we went in there we sided with the poppy
[01:37:25.860 --> 01:37:30.820]  growers and the heroin went back into the banks and the laundered money went
[01:37:30.820 --> 01:37:36.580]  back to the international banks and it you know stopped that first 2003 little
[01:37:36.580 --> 01:37:43.020]  recession that we had so again I don't know what to do Alex this is all the end
[01:37:43.020 --> 01:37:48.660]  result of war whenever you have war people think it's a glorious thing and
[01:37:48.660 --> 01:37:53.780]  it's a wonderful thing you know to be victorious that war but they don't look
[01:37:53.780 --> 01:37:58.900]  at that the kickback and the results the majority of people that die in wars or
[01:37:58.900 --> 01:38:04.340]  civilians not military that's a known fact and what is the end result now
[01:38:04.340 --> 01:38:09.100]  you've got all these people with nowhere to go because you got total unrest over
[01:38:09.100 --> 01:38:15.100]  there where are they all going to go now you know and the wars continue on so
[01:38:15.100 --> 01:38:18.980]  you're going to continue with more and more of this and this is the blowback
[01:38:18.980 --> 01:38:24.260]  from it and people need to understand that before they decide to commit the
[01:38:24.260 --> 01:38:29.220]  war that there will be a blowback when the war is over there will be
[01:38:29.220 --> 01:38:35.940]  repercussions that even at war when you win you ultimately may lose follow me
[01:38:35.940 --> 01:38:39.740]  they have a term for that in fact if Buckley can come in here he was telling
[01:38:39.740 --> 01:38:43.380]  me about the term of the day about a war you win but from the collateral damage
[01:38:43.380 --> 01:38:47.460]  you end up losing down the road there's a particular known term for that we can
[01:38:47.460 --> 01:38:51.060]  pull up but absolutely governor you're right but if we go back to the PNAC
[01:38:51.060 --> 01:38:54.220]  document be building America's defenses that I know you covered on your
[01:38:54.220 --> 01:38:59.940]  television program a conspiracy theory where they admit the plan was to
[01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:03.860]  destabilize the Middle East make it more radical and then have a new coming
[01:39:03.860 --> 01:39:08.940]  super war with the radical jihadis and now we see that but now we see the
[01:39:08.940 --> 01:39:13.700]  former head of defense intelligence and the deputy out of the CIA coming out
[01:39:13.700 --> 01:39:18.900]  and admitting our government funded al Qaeda and and then change the name to
[01:39:18.900 --> 01:39:23.340]  ISIS so I think that's very positive that we have Congress people talking
[01:39:23.340 --> 01:39:27.700]  about the 28 pages and more aren't you and I and other 9-11 truthers that have
[01:39:27.700 --> 01:39:33.300]  been so demonized aren't we vindicated now I believe we are I believe those 28
[01:39:33.300 --> 01:39:38.340]  redacted pages if they make them public has vindicated us because that shows
[01:39:38.340 --> 01:39:43.780]  that it was not what they told us if these guys were financed by the upper
[01:39:43.780 --> 01:39:50.180]  echelon house of sod in Saudi Arabia then were they even operatives of al Qaeda
[01:39:50.180 --> 01:39:56.620]  were they even operatives of the Taliban who knows I mean we're changing
[01:39:56.620 --> 01:40:01.580]  opponents over there every six months one week we're with these guys the next
[01:40:01.580 --> 01:40:06.340]  week we're with these guys and it's just a big chess game going on over there
[01:40:06.340 --> 01:40:12.020]  that as an individual taxpayer you have no idea from one week to the next what
[01:40:12.020 --> 01:40:17.860]  exactly is going on over there and that's why I ran Paul and Bernie Sanders
[01:40:17.860 --> 01:40:23.580]  are the only three I know who are saying get the hell out of there completely
[01:40:23.580 --> 01:40:29.900]  well I totally agree with you on that front all I know is I saw farmers market
[01:40:29.900 --> 01:40:34.860]  it looked really nice and Omaha Nebraska I went there for an hour my suitcase
[01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:38.620]  wasn't that full so I got some stuff from my mom some grape jelly some grapes
[01:40:38.620 --> 01:40:43.540]  some bell peppers I put it in my bag I didn't think oh I can't take grape jelly
[01:40:43.540 --> 01:40:47.020]  and they kept asking me for like 35 minutes why did you try to sneak this
[01:40:47.020 --> 01:40:50.380]  through we're gonna search you again they just tore everything apart test it
[01:40:50.380 --> 01:40:54.740]  they tested for bombs opened up the can of jelly and they do they were so
[01:40:54.740 --> 01:40:58.660]  upset and it was like mental illness it was like twilight zone I said it's great
[01:40:58.660 --> 01:41:05.580]  jelly you know it's great jelly they take women's pumped milk they take you
[01:41:05.580 --> 01:41:09.860]  know little things of perfume away and I mean they thought I was trying to sneak
[01:41:09.860 --> 01:41:13.180]  it through no I thought I lived in a free country where I could stick a thing of
[01:41:13.180 --> 01:41:18.340]  jelly for my mother in a bag and it's just I want my country back you haven't
[01:41:18.340 --> 01:41:24.220]  flown in years and it's just ridiculous that well they're funding al-qaeda sorry
[01:41:24.220 --> 01:41:29.120]  go ahead Alex I did the best I could I tried to go to federal court I spent
[01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:36.740]  20,000 of my own dollars to try to go against Homeland Security and and the
[01:41:36.740 --> 01:41:41.700]  TSA and as I said it got thrown out of court the federal judge said that she
[01:41:41.700 --> 01:41:47.340]  didn't have jurisdiction and I sued under the Fourth Amendment so what are you
[01:41:47.340 --> 01:41:52.740]  to do nothing they they they they're immune and that's the way the Democrats
[01:41:52.740 --> 01:41:57.900]  and Republicans have set our government up to be today to be immune when when
[01:41:57.900 --> 01:42:02.340]  they decide to implement a policy whether that policy follows the
[01:42:02.340 --> 01:42:07.380]  Constitution or the Bill of Rights or not is irrelevant to them and I know I'm
[01:42:07.380 --> 01:42:11.420]  beating the dead horse but I'm gonna keep telling people as long as you keep
[01:42:11.420 --> 01:42:18.020]  electing Democrats and Republicans this is what you are going to get well I
[01:42:18.020 --> 01:42:20.780]  agree with you I want to go to phone calls Joe Biggs we were talking about
[01:42:20.780 --> 01:42:26.860]  his pieces in here now you heard the governor talk about the narcotics went
[01:42:26.860 --> 01:42:31.340]  from you know 10% of world production to 130% of world production they didn't
[01:42:31.340 --> 01:42:36.260]  just become 90% they they then topped it you know 13 times that's the
[01:42:36.260 --> 01:42:39.540]  Associated Press own numbers you were over there in Afghanistan almost died
[01:42:39.540 --> 01:42:44.060]  there repeatedly you're also in Iraq you know what do you think of Intura's
[01:42:44.060 --> 01:42:47.020]  perspective on this I mean he's completely and totally correct about the
[01:42:47.020 --> 01:42:52.180]  the opium because I myself my unit was sent out to actually guard opium filled
[01:42:52.180 --> 01:42:56.460]  sometimes and then sometime in order to take them down depending on if these
[01:42:56.460 --> 01:43:00.460]  guys would play ball with us or not so that's definitely going on and then the
[01:43:00.460 --> 01:43:03.780]  fact that the State Department's gonna come out and release information to the
[01:43:03.780 --> 01:43:07.380]  Department of the Army telling them hey don't stop the pedophilia that is a
[01:43:07.380 --> 01:43:11.580]  cultural issue that's not a cultural issue that's a humanitarian issue that's
[01:43:11.580 --> 01:43:15.340]  child abuse that's rape why are we going over we're supposed to go to
[01:43:15.340 --> 01:43:20.540]  Afghanistan to help them instead we've produced a way more opium ever and now
[01:43:20.540 --> 01:43:25.180]  we're allowing we're not even that we're telling soldiers Marines airmen to not
[01:43:25.180 --> 01:43:28.700]  even go in and stop it and that just shows you what they're gonna do the
[01:43:28.700 --> 01:43:32.740]  fact that they fired this Sergeant First Class who's an operator in the special
[01:43:32.740 --> 01:43:36.700]  forces hey you're out of here because you stopped you're trying to stop pedophilia
[01:43:36.700 --> 01:43:41.740]  that's the message there they're putting out that's ridiculous well I mean
[01:43:41.740 --> 01:43:44.980]  political correctness has gone so far where we have to adopt everybody else's
[01:43:44.980 --> 01:43:51.140]  culture Alex yeah how about John Pericott the CIA guy that refused to
[01:43:51.140 --> 01:43:55.900]  torture and he exposed the torture and had to go to jail for three years I
[01:43:55.900 --> 01:44:02.540]  remember that the guy that go to jail over torture was the guy who exposed it
[01:44:02.540 --> 01:44:06.420]  it's this exact same story or all these reporters I mean I know you didn't like
[01:44:06.420 --> 01:44:10.340]  Obama you're nonpartisan but they admit even liberal professors he's
[01:44:10.340 --> 01:44:16.540]  prosecuted triple the number of reporters than any other president before
[01:44:16.540 --> 01:44:19.060]  well that's what Michael Hastings was said he said there was a complete and
[01:44:19.060 --> 01:44:22.500]  total war on journalism a war on journalists ever since the Obama
[01:44:22.500 --> 01:44:28.380]  administration had taken charge that he was basically hushed and told what to do
[01:44:28.380 --> 01:44:32.700]  and what not to do he was kicked off of Air Force one because he was telling the
[01:44:32.700 --> 01:44:36.620]  truth about stuff they didn't like that and his car blew up I want to go to phone
[01:44:36.620 --> 01:44:40.740]  calls for Jesse Ventura do you have any other questions or comments Joe negative
[01:44:40.740 --> 01:44:43.580]  that's it thanks all right great job with your report thank you so much there
[01:44:43.580 --> 01:44:46.980]  goes Joe Biggs he'll be of course filing reports from Full Wars Nightly News
[01:44:46.980 --> 01:44:51.020]  coming up this evening Jesse I want to go to Mike Kevin Ronnie Bill Jeff and
[01:44:51.020 --> 01:44:55.180]  others before we go any further one of my favorite books that you've written and
[01:44:55.180 --> 01:44:59.860]  I've read almost all the books you've written at least the modern ones because
[01:44:59.860 --> 01:45:04.540]  they have so much info I even learn stuff from also love how each subject has a
[01:45:04.540 --> 01:45:09.700]  chapter but my favorite book you've written American conspiracies that's
[01:45:09.700 --> 01:45:12.860]  going to be coming back into print it was a best-seller and it's going to be
[01:45:12.860 --> 01:45:19.580]  updated correct yeah we did Russell and I through our publisher at Sky Horse Tony
[01:45:19.580 --> 01:45:24.260]  Lyons wanted to do it you know you could write a new chapter Alex almost every
[01:45:24.260 --> 01:45:27.900]  year because the government's going to do something on a yearly basis that
[01:45:27.900 --> 01:45:32.700]  will fit into the book so we did chapters one very close to my heart on
[01:45:32.700 --> 01:45:39.940]  POWs and MIAs and it shows that how young people are misled in the military
[01:45:39.940 --> 01:45:44.940]  to believe you're told if you get captured we will do anything and
[01:45:44.940 --> 01:45:50.500]  everything to get you home well we show in the book how that's simply not true
[01:45:50.500 --> 01:45:56.860]  if you become a political liability you're gone young man or woman there
[01:45:56.860 --> 01:46:01.540]  ain't no US government that's going to come to get you and the case in point is
[01:46:01.540 --> 01:46:07.260]  Captain Scott Spiker the that he was a flyer during the first Bush Gulf War he
[01:46:07.260 --> 01:46:12.700]  was declared dead the first day by then Secretary Defense Dick Cheney who never
[01:46:12.700 --> 01:46:18.340]  served in the military it turned out it was not true Cheney put a fact out that
[01:46:18.340 --> 01:46:22.260]  was false he was he was he was over there for over 12 years
[01:46:22.260 --> 01:46:27.780]  eventually captured by Saddam Hussein who used him as a bargaining chip but when
[01:46:27.780 --> 01:46:36.100]  we invaded he then lost his value and Saddam killed him well you're certainly
[01:46:36.100 --> 01:46:39.900]  right about that and it's just crazy what we've been taught to put up with I
[01:46:39.900 --> 01:46:43.300]  mean I see a lot of folks waking up but it's kind of a paradox they're waking
[01:46:43.300 --> 01:46:47.220]  up and then just saying what do you do about it in your gut Jesse where do you
[01:46:47.220 --> 01:46:50.540]  see this country and the rest of the world going I mean look at the Russians
[01:46:50.540 --> 01:46:54.340]  are moving a base into Syria to fight against ISIS and al-Qaeda our own
[01:46:54.340 --> 01:47:00.020]  governments secretly backing them that's come out we've got the Saudi royal
[01:47:00.020 --> 01:47:05.100]  family by the UN being appointed to lead the UN human rights panel that's like
[01:47:05.100 --> 01:47:09.580]  having Jeffrey Dahmer be on the panel against cannibalism we've just got all
[01:47:09.580 --> 01:47:16.580]  sorts of craziness going on well I guess the good thing it might be crazy but I
[01:47:16.580 --> 01:47:24.860]  still believe in humanity and I believe in man surviving and and and that the
[01:47:24.860 --> 01:47:30.500]  good will win in the end I still have that belief and I believe it's being
[01:47:30.500 --> 01:47:35.000]  shown right now politically in our country by the fact that you see the
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:40.140]  three the three leaders of the Republican run for president are all
[01:47:40.140 --> 01:47:46.060]  people who are not career politicians and then you flip it to the other side
[01:47:46.060 --> 01:47:51.980]  and you see Bernie Sanders independent default socialist much like the
[01:47:51.980 --> 01:47:57.340]  socialism and people shouldn't run from the word socialism socialism practice
[01:47:57.340 --> 01:48:01.700]  very good in Sweden Norway and the Scandinavian countries and they have a
[01:48:01.700 --> 01:48:06.580]  very high standard of living there's certain things we can use from socialism
[01:48:06.580 --> 01:48:12.780]  you need a combination of both to make a healthy country and so I see that as a
[01:48:12.780 --> 01:48:18.780]  shake-up of belief that I'm seeing the American people starting to starting to
[01:48:18.780 --> 01:48:23.860]  wake up and they're starting to realize that we still can control it by the
[01:48:23.860 --> 01:48:29.380]  people we elect and if we continue on that road I don't think we've lost yet
[01:48:29.380 --> 01:48:36.660]  Alex well I'll tell you this on the socialism debate yes if socialism is
[01:48:36.660 --> 01:48:40.700]  only partial and is implemented by a hands-off government and equally
[01:48:40.700 --> 01:48:45.540]  distributed it can create some pretty successful societies if there's a
[01:48:45.540 --> 01:48:50.420]  larger free market system that's left alone you can siphon off of it but the
[01:48:50.420 --> 01:48:54.500]  monopoly socialism run by the globalist that George Soros and others are
[01:48:54.500 --> 01:48:59.220]  pushing is a system to control people clowered and piven basically and it's
[01:48:59.220 --> 01:49:03.780]  very very bad and Bernie Sanders you know wants to basically have programs
[01:49:03.780 --> 01:49:09.500]  that raise taxes to 80 plus percent like France and then the elite themselves
[01:49:09.500 --> 01:49:14.620]  are tax exempt I just can't think of a worse system I cannot believe Bernie
[01:49:14.620 --> 01:49:20.340]  Sanders would support exempting the elite I I'm not gonna buy that out no no
[01:49:20.340 --> 01:49:25.540]  I'm not saying he would I'm saying the socialist system let's remember
[01:49:25.540 --> 01:49:32.180]  something we've already proved socialism alone can't survive and we've
[01:49:32.180 --> 01:49:37.980]  proved capitalism alone can't survive you need a combination of both to have a
[01:49:37.980 --> 01:49:42.660]  healthy standard of living now the problem with our capitalist system today
[01:49:42.660 --> 01:49:47.500]  is the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer and that divide
[01:49:47.500 --> 01:49:53.700]  is getting so big that it's it may never be brought back in line again why you
[01:49:53.700 --> 01:49:58.180]  know people have griped about a minimum wage now you're gonna hear a shocker for
[01:49:58.180 --> 01:50:04.620]  me max I think we should have a maximum wage well the problem is the globalist
[01:50:04.620 --> 01:50:08.900]  have found ways to get around all of that and whatever the globalists are I'm
[01:50:08.900 --> 01:50:15.060]  just talking from Jesse Ventura if you can't if someone can't live on 50
[01:50:15.060 --> 01:50:21.180]  million dollars a year then I might support capital punishment no I mean I
[01:50:21.180 --> 01:50:24.180]  understand extreme examples and I get what you're coming from the you know the
[01:50:24.180 --> 01:50:28.940]  point of the matter is that's the picture we need to look at Alex's you've got
[01:50:28.940 --> 01:50:35.500]  this echelon the 1% of 1% that are I mean look at what's her name I saw a show
[01:50:35.500 --> 01:50:40.820]  on Farini or whatever her name is the woman running for president yes I heard
[01:50:40.820 --> 01:50:47.020]  a guy from Yale it was on Smirkomish Smirkomish Adamon this weekend he said
[01:50:47.020 --> 01:50:52.580]  that when she took over Hewlett Packard that by the time she left the stock
[01:50:52.580 --> 01:50:57.140]  holders stock had cut in half and yet she got a hundred million dollars in
[01:50:57.140 --> 01:51:02.100]  severance yeah let me throw this excuse me that's what I'm talking about
[01:51:02.100 --> 01:51:09.020]  capitalism being damn near being damn near well that's not camel that's
[01:51:09.020 --> 01:51:13.860]  crony capitalism and and that's just damn near criminal where somebody can
[01:51:13.860 --> 01:51:19.580]  come into a company and the stock drops in half and that person leaves and gets
[01:51:19.580 --> 01:51:24.260]  a hundred million dollars I hear you but that's what the stockholders allowed
[01:51:24.260 --> 01:51:27.940]  let me just throw in this fact though it's a great documentary why a certain
[01:51:27.940 --> 01:51:33.860]  amount of socialism is okay sure let me just throw this at you and then I want
[01:51:33.860 --> 01:51:36.260]  to hit a few phone calls you better leave here in just about five minutes I
[01:51:36.260 --> 01:51:40.300]  want to throw this out there I saw an excellent documentary and I was already
[01:51:40.300 --> 01:51:46.100]  aware of the numbers but to see the debates from the 1970s it was a debate
[01:51:46.100 --> 01:51:51.940]  between William F. Buckley and Gore Vidal it was on NBC it was a whole series
[01:51:51.940 --> 01:51:59.020]  of them you know during the whole Nixon reelection campaign and during that they
[01:51:59.020 --> 01:52:03.460]  were pointing out that the top five percent had like 30% of the wealth and
[01:52:03.460 --> 01:52:07.740]  that socialism was the answer to fix it well we've got higher taxes more
[01:52:07.740 --> 01:52:14.540]  regulations more socialism and now it's 1% with 55 60% of the wealth and I'm
[01:52:14.540 --> 01:52:18.180]  just saying they're always gonna game it Jesse the only way to not game it is to
[01:52:18.180 --> 01:52:21.660]  have incredibly low taxes across the board and that's the only thing that
[01:52:21.660 --> 01:52:26.300]  allows the free market to flourish well what's better than that go to my method
[01:52:26.300 --> 01:52:30.900]  get rid of ballast the income tax to a national sales tax if you really get
[01:52:30.900 --> 01:52:34.980]  rid of the income tax that I would be for that ballast the income tax and go
[01:52:34.980 --> 01:52:39.780]  to a national sales tax then everybody pays and wealth is determined by what
[01:52:39.780 --> 01:52:43.420]  you buy not what you make I totally agree that's the way to go just even
[01:52:43.420 --> 01:52:47.100]  turns our guest I'm Alex Jones your host we just kept this break let's go
[01:52:47.100 --> 01:52:52.860]  ahead and go to Ronnie in Texas you're on the air with Jesse Ventura go ahead
[01:52:52.860 --> 01:52:58.820]  Ronnie thank you sir yes I'm agreed Dr. Rand Paul is I think the best candidate
[01:52:58.820 --> 01:53:03.040]  he's anti-war anti-Trump anti the ongoing counterproductive war and
[01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:09.660]  pot smokers he's anti-NDAA he filibustered it so I believe it's up to
[01:53:09.660 --> 01:53:15.100]  you and me and all of us to differentiate the real Dr. Rand Paul from
[01:53:15.100 --> 01:53:21.220]  all those other corrupt politicians let me jump from there and I think your
[01:53:21.220 --> 01:53:26.260]  question is what Jesse is your view of Rand Paul well I I agree with many of
[01:53:26.260 --> 01:53:30.900]  Rand Paul's issues I I stand with him solidly about getting our military get
[01:53:30.900 --> 01:53:36.780]  out of the Middle East I stand with him on ending the war on drugs if I had a
[01:53:36.780 --> 01:53:41.500]  guy on my show a 10-year police officer in Baltimore who told me the
[01:53:41.500 --> 01:53:46.620]  militarization of America right now is directly the path of the war on drugs
[01:53:46.620 --> 01:53:52.300]  absolutely caused it absolutely decriminalized now Ronnie thank you for
[01:53:52.300 --> 01:53:56.580]  the call war on drugs and you'll stop seeing these big vehicles
[01:53:56.580 --> 01:54:02.620]  ramming people's doors down and coming and violating our constitutional rights
[01:54:02.620 --> 01:54:06.740]  every day absolutely let's go to Jeff in California you're on the air Jeff go
[01:54:06.740 --> 01:54:12.420]  ahead hey Alex and Jesse what do you guys think of this David Knight for
[01:54:12.420 --> 01:54:16.580]  president 2016 he'd make a great president sure seriously what's your
[01:54:16.580 --> 01:54:21.340]  question David Knight's a reporter here at M4's governor oh okay you caught me
[01:54:21.340 --> 01:54:26.620]  on that one little inside baseball Jeff do you have another point well not a
[01:54:26.620 --> 01:54:30.220]  man if you guys could throw one more money bomb and throw him on the ticket
[01:54:30.220 --> 01:54:33.140]  he has the best campaign of what he says
[01:54:33.140 --> 01:54:38.540]  well David Knight's a great guy appreciate your call Kevin in Florida
[01:54:38.540 --> 01:54:44.860]  you're on the air with Jesse Ventura go ahead thank you Alex my question is a
[01:54:44.860 --> 01:54:49.380]  governor Ventura why are you so pro open border I don't want to sound like I'm
[01:54:49.380 --> 01:54:53.060]  against open borders but the majority of people that are coming over here
[01:54:53.060 --> 01:54:57.260]  illegally are not trying to do it the right way they're here they're here for
[01:54:57.260 --> 01:55:04.060]  the free money the free medical care the free health care why are you blaming
[01:55:04.060 --> 01:55:09.540]  our system and our politicians who made it all available to them if that's the
[01:55:09.540 --> 01:55:13.740]  case I don't necessarily believe what you're saying there but if that's the
[01:55:13.740 --> 01:55:18.980]  case why aren't you angry at the Democrats and Republicans for creating a
[01:55:18.980 --> 01:55:24.340]  system that allows these people to get on it yeah for the caller I mean I get
[01:55:24.340 --> 01:55:28.500]  what Ventura saying he's saying don't make it about the individual that's just
[01:55:28.500 --> 01:55:32.860]  trying to escape poverty make it about the system that allows it it's like
[01:55:32.860 --> 01:55:38.300]  instead of blaming the TSA how about we blame Congress who actually put this in
[01:55:38.300 --> 01:55:43.060]  place let's get rid of it and just face the danger of the so-called terrorism and
[01:55:43.060 --> 01:55:45.860]  I think the airlines would even make more money what do you think Jesse well
[01:55:45.860 --> 01:55:50.540]  again you know people are not going to the root of the problem that's the point
[01:55:50.540 --> 01:55:56.260]  Alex you know and I don't buy you know everybody wants to start everyone
[01:55:56.260 --> 01:56:02.180]  forgets unless you're Native American you immigrated here and the majority of
[01:56:02.180 --> 01:56:07.260]  illegal immigrants guess what they come in by plane they don't come across the
[01:56:07.260 --> 01:56:11.980]  border no I know that's certainly now they come in by airplane and I don't
[01:56:11.980 --> 01:56:16.060]  think they're full of Mexicans necessarily this whole border I'll tell
[01:56:16.060 --> 01:56:21.940]  you what this country is behaving like 1930s Germany right now we want the
[01:56:21.940 --> 01:56:25.980]  biggest toughest military we're gonna kick everybody's ass and we're putting
[01:56:25.980 --> 01:56:30.700]  every blame of every ill thing in this country on the Mexicans just like the
[01:56:30.700 --> 01:56:35.380]  Germans did to the Jews well I think the case here is a little bit different
[01:56:35.380 --> 01:56:39.780]  because I don't you got Latin America collapsing Mexico was the biggest group
[01:56:39.780 --> 01:56:43.140]  of immigrants it is Chinese now I don't care whether they're white Chinese
[01:56:43.140 --> 01:56:46.940]  whatever I shouldn't have to pay for an anchor baby I can't go to China and pay
[01:56:46.940 --> 01:56:51.700]  for it then let's lead the charge and let's take down the stats I know I already
[01:56:51.700 --> 01:56:55.620]  heard all that no no no it's what you said we should get rid of the incentives
[01:56:55.620 --> 01:57:00.060]  because I'm all for immigration as long as the Statue of Liberty Alex I think
[01:57:00.060 --> 01:57:04.860]  we'll take down paying for folks baby I think we'll take it down I think we'll
[01:57:04.860 --> 01:57:08.180]  pay sure I think I don't know I think it's ugly I say you're rid of it I
[01:57:08.180 --> 01:57:12.220]  agree with you take it down because it says send us your poor send us your
[01:57:12.220 --> 01:57:14.740]  down well that's not in the Constitution and Bellarites that was the
[01:57:14.740 --> 01:57:20.460]  mason's and we want your doctors and lawyers so take that Statue of Liberty
[01:57:20.460 --> 01:57:25.620]  down I agree take it down take it down I think we ought to sell tickets and you
[01:57:25.620 --> 01:57:29.740]  know put a rocket ship hundred shoes of the moon how's that sound and let's not
[01:57:29.740 --> 01:57:36.140]  be racist we need a wall at Canada to absolutely I think we ought to have
[01:57:36.140 --> 01:57:40.820]  robots patrolling the poor listen we can and now we can call ourselves the
[01:57:40.820 --> 01:57:47.500]  United States of East Berlin no excuse me didn't Ronald Reagan say once
[01:57:47.500 --> 01:57:52.940]  tear down that wall yeah well hey what about that let me let me say what about
[01:57:52.940 --> 01:57:57.020]  Mexico and their wall that Mexico has their most draconian immigration laws
[01:57:57.020 --> 01:58:02.420]  in the Americas but it's okay when they do it right because that Mexico has the
[01:58:02.420 --> 01:58:07.100]  most draconian immigration laws for Central Americans and that one-year hard
[01:58:07.100 --> 01:58:10.180]  labor if they catch you coming in you I mean you know they got a big fence down
[01:58:10.180 --> 01:58:16.420]  there right so will you say Mexico tear down that Guatemalan wall no I don't know
[01:58:16.420 --> 01:58:21.740]  anything about that down there all I know is I live 950 miles down there and I
[01:58:21.740 --> 01:58:26.900]  ain't seen a wall I think you should run for president of Mexico that I should I
[01:58:26.900 --> 01:58:30.100]  can't I'm not Mexican well they should let you and you should be able to have
[01:58:30.100 --> 01:58:34.780]  babies for free I think Jesse we love you let me see about you in the break

[02:00:06.100 --> 02:00:12.940]  brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:12.940 --> 02:00:20.460]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:20.460 --> 02:00:34.540]  Alex Jones and I tell you that was a heated discussion with Jesse Ventura we
[02:00:34.540 --> 02:00:40.540]  just argue more and more on air and you know Jesse really believes what he
[02:00:40.540 --> 02:00:45.660]  believes he really believes in the justice of it and he really believes in
[02:00:45.660 --> 02:00:52.260]  the fairness aspect of it but it's not fair that Mexico has a wall offense and
[02:00:52.260 --> 02:00:56.020]  puts Guatemalans in forced labor for a year but then expects everybody to come
[02:00:56.020 --> 02:00:59.460]  up here and have everything for free and that Mexico teaches a liberation
[02:00:59.460 --> 02:01:04.980]  theology and teaches that the southwest belongs to Mexico when Russia had
[02:01:04.980 --> 02:01:12.460]  California you know Spain had Texas the French had Texas and Louisiana that's
[02:01:12.460 --> 02:01:16.660]  why there's six flags over Texas there were a bunch of empires I mean for heaven
[02:01:16.660 --> 02:01:21.220]  sakes the Austrian Hungarian Empire the German Empire ran Mexico for off and on
[02:01:21.220 --> 02:01:27.060]  for 60 years after Spain left so it's just crazy we like if Russians try to
[02:01:27.060 --> 02:01:32.220]  claiming that they had some take on California or Alaska well you may have a
[02:01:32.220 --> 02:01:37.140]  couple hundred years ago but you don't now and I'm not anti-Russian then I say
[02:01:37.140 --> 02:01:42.740]  that the globalists have conquered America the globalist are conquering all
[02:01:42.740 --> 02:01:47.340]  our countries and playing us off against each other and I don't think it's a fair
[02:01:47.340 --> 02:01:56.660]  debate to just play the card that it's racist to say that you know Mexicans are
[02:01:56.660 --> 02:02:01.380]  are bad if you're for you know the borders being closed but that people
[02:02:01.380 --> 02:02:05.060]  aren't saying Mexicans are evil inherently because we don't want the
[02:02:05.060 --> 02:02:09.740]  border completely wide open this isn't Mexico I mean I can't even go down to
[02:02:09.740 --> 02:02:13.740]  Mexico and own land except in small controlled areas I don't have rights as
[02:02:13.740 --> 02:02:18.260]  an American down there if Mexico reciprocated and treated us the same
[02:02:18.260 --> 02:02:22.420]  then we could have a treaty and more open borders but it's just not a one-way
[02:02:22.420 --> 02:02:30.180]  street and I don't like to debate Ventura when we're short on time with a big
[02:02:30.180 --> 02:02:35.140]  question like do you want to get rid of the Statue of Liberty I'm like yeah yeah
[02:02:35.140 --> 02:02:38.980]  let's send it to the moon let's send it to Mars quite frankly it's an
[02:02:38.980 --> 02:02:45.420]  Illuminati symbol quite frankly it's obnoxious quite frankly it's a globalist
[02:02:45.420 --> 02:02:49.140]  instrument of propaganda and I personally don't like the Statue of Liberty I
[02:02:49.140 --> 02:02:54.740]  think it's an interesting piece of art but it's a man in drag the maker of it
[02:02:54.740 --> 02:02:59.220]  admitted that it's something what people think it is and you know it sits there
[02:02:59.220 --> 02:03:03.660]  and says give me your tired give me your hungry give me your starving that's not
[02:03:03.660 --> 02:03:08.820]  what this country was about this country was give us your freeboaters give us
[02:03:08.820 --> 02:03:15.060]  your your swashbucklers give us your builders give us your your strivers give
[02:03:15.060 --> 02:03:19.620]  us your trailblazers give us your rugged individualist and coming up in
[02:03:19.620 --> 02:03:23.220]  studio at the bottom of the hour you want to hear about the migrants as they
[02:03:23.220 --> 02:03:33.300]  call them first don't call them illegals then just call them migrants so it's
[02:03:33.300 --> 02:03:38.740]  all part of this UN global agenda where groups can migrate wherever they want so
[02:03:38.740 --> 02:03:42.700]  the globalists can selectively bring in giant hordes of people who don't
[02:03:42.700 --> 02:03:49.780]  integrate so that they can have a divide and conquer strategy and it just gives
[02:03:49.780 --> 02:03:58.660]  me a headache that the people that push having open borders will not have a real
[02:03:58.660 --> 02:04:03.460]  debate on the subject the fact that none of these Arab countries will take any
[02:04:03.460 --> 02:04:08.100]  of the refugees the fact that Latin American countries have strict controls
[02:04:08.100 --> 02:04:14.100]  and borders and if they didn't the ones that don't end up being failed states I
[02:04:14.100 --> 02:04:20.300]  mean this is how you bring a country down half of Arizona now has signs up
[02:04:20.300 --> 02:04:26.100]  saying don't go down this road under the control of cartels our government has
[02:04:26.100 --> 02:04:31.660]  given roughly half of Arizona the southern half to the drug cartels now
[02:04:31.660 --> 02:04:35.780]  that doesn't mean I'm for the drug war either decriminalized in the incentive
[02:04:35.780 --> 02:04:40.980]  for the drug cartels but while we got the drug war running we've got to control
[02:04:40.980 --> 02:04:45.800]  the sovereign territory of this nation I mean it's a fraud the TSA wants to

[02:05:12.220 --> 02:05:16.300]  pat down but the TSA agents insisted upon searching his bags after finding the
[02:05:16.300 --> 02:05:19.420]  jar of grape jelly the agents told Jones he was lucky they would still allow him
[02:05:19.420 --> 02:05:23.580]  to fly after such a violation Jones recapped on the Sunday show they searched

[02:05:38.060 --> 02:05:40.980]  encounters with the prostitute and then shared them on their personal email
[02:05:40.980 --> 02:05:44.260]  accounts which they connected to their work phones according to the TSA and

[02:10:09.660 --> 02:10:15.460]  harassed by TSA over jar of grape jelly I got photos of it and then another
[02:10:15.460 --> 02:10:20.500]  article all Republican presidential candidates stand for war you know I read
[02:10:20.500 --> 02:10:26.220]  that article and I agree with Roberts on most issues but Rand Paul is not
[02:10:26.220 --> 02:10:31.820]  supporting war so I'm a little bit little bit confused by that but almost all
[02:10:31.820 --> 02:10:37.220]  of them are that is certainly a fair statement and look I've been critical
[02:10:37.220 --> 02:10:41.580]  of Rand Paul only saying he should get more fired up but if you watch that
[02:10:41.580 --> 02:10:46.580]  debate last Wednesday night and we covered it live here during the 28 hour
[02:10:46.580 --> 02:10:51.420]  transmission he's hands down the best candidate I mean Trump's funny to watch
[02:10:51.420 --> 02:11:00.100]  he's fun he says a lot of stuff that's true but it's just crazy you know
[02:11:00.100 --> 02:11:04.340]  talking about optics I saw a story over the weekend about Vladimir Putin and
[02:11:04.340 --> 02:11:10.900]  Berlusconi the former president of Italy in eastern Ukraine in Crimea at a famous
[02:11:10.900 --> 02:11:16.220]  vineyard and they were they opened up a bottle of thousands of bottles of wine
[02:11:16.220 --> 02:11:23.180]  that were there that was 210 years old you just type in Putin and Berlusconi in
[02:11:23.180 --> 02:11:29.900]  Ukraine probe for drinking Crimea wine and this is a stunt they know will reach
[02:11:29.900 --> 02:11:41.020]  out to the proletariat at the time that that bottle of wine was court was
[02:11:41.020 --> 02:11:46.540]  produced Russia fully controlled Ukraine and fully controlled Crimea and the
[02:11:46.540 --> 02:11:50.300]  Crimea was part of Russia but that doesn't matter they're now claiming that
[02:11:50.300 --> 02:11:55.700]  Putin and Berlusconi stole a bottle of wine that was part of a PR stunt just
[02:11:55.700 --> 02:12:00.300]  promoting local Ukrainian wine like oh we're here with the farmers yes let's
[02:12:00.300 --> 02:12:05.380]  open some wine why it's very old and then they reduce it down to the ultimate
[02:12:05.380 --> 02:12:12.460]  crime BBC CNN Fox News Associated Press Reuters French news agencies that
[02:12:12.460 --> 02:12:18.860]  Vladimir Putin is there looting the Ukrainian wine the globalist over through
[02:12:18.860 --> 02:12:23.100]  the country two years ago they put it into civil war they appointed a government
[02:12:23.100 --> 02:12:27.180]  they're bombing and shelling all over the country the Russians have taken a
[02:12:27.180 --> 02:12:33.020]  small area that has their pipelines Joe Biden's son the one that lived not the
[02:12:33.020 --> 02:12:36.180]  other one you know is over there claiming he owns the pipelines now he
[02:12:36.180 --> 02:12:41.220]  heads the company that's getting him it's a power grab in Russia's backyard and
[02:12:41.220 --> 02:12:45.740]  the public is so angry over a bottle of wine the globalists are robbing us with
[02:12:45.740 --> 02:12:49.420]  Obamacare the robbing us of our future they're turning ISIS and al-Qaeda loose
[02:12:49.420 --> 02:12:55.900]  all over the world and they could reduce this though down to Berlusconi and
[02:12:55.900 --> 02:13:03.380]  Putin are in Ukraine stealing the wine and there's a major investigation in
[02:13:03.380 --> 02:13:08.060]  Berlusconi is banned from Ukraine by the Ukrainian authorities in the West well
[02:13:08.060 --> 02:13:13.780]  guess what you don't control that area but it just shows how everything is
[02:13:13.780 --> 02:13:20.460]  turned into propaganda now everything turns into some giant stunt and the real
[02:13:20.460 --> 02:13:28.060]  communist threat this Pope is running around telling us we can't have air
[02:13:28.060 --> 02:13:32.980]  conditioning and that we can't have hot meals and we can't have nice lives why
[02:13:32.980 --> 02:13:36.580]  not say we should make clean technologies why not say we need to build new
[02:13:36.580 --> 02:13:41.740]  civilizations no it's we need to have a new dark age overseen by some guy above
[02:13:41.740 --> 02:13:47.780]  the law tax exempt in an armored palace it's obscene and the left is making
[02:13:47.780 --> 02:13:51.340]  their move worldwide and a lot of people who've been libertarians or
[02:13:51.340 --> 02:13:57.580]  conservatives are deciding join with the left worldwide in the takeover and I'm
[02:13:57.580 --> 02:14:01.940]  seeing this more and more with people where they're going from being
[02:14:01.940 --> 02:14:06.580]  libertarians to just absolutely just getting on the bandwagon yeah let's pay
[02:14:06.580 --> 02:14:10.260]  for everything free for foreigners you're racist if you don't support it
[02:14:10.260 --> 02:14:15.060]  yeah this pope's a great guy yeah we need to go ahead and go along with all
[02:14:15.060 --> 02:14:22.260]  this it's a very dangerous dangerous dangerous situation now I'm gonna go to
[02:14:22.260 --> 02:14:27.780]  your phone calls Gerald and Sonny and Dan and Radle and others that are
[02:14:27.780 --> 02:14:32.340]  patiently holding but first this article is up on prisonplanet.com and
[02:14:32.340 --> 02:14:37.980]  infowars.com and I defend good police officers I defend local government when
[02:14:37.980 --> 02:14:41.940]  it's constitutional I don't take what one bad cop does and projected on to all
[02:14:41.940 --> 02:14:47.220]  the rest of the cops that's the White House and social engineering but more
[02:14:47.220 --> 02:14:54.540]  and more I see videos of pro-lifers on the side of the road or constitutionalist
[02:14:54.540 --> 02:14:58.540]  out on the sidewalk in front of a university this is happening all over
[02:14:58.540 --> 02:15:02.380]  the country they'll do it on Constitution Day or Patriots Day handing
[02:15:02.380 --> 02:15:05.500]  out this is a new event but I see these every few months
[02:15:05.500 --> 02:15:11.420]  pop constitutions and the police will arrest you or find you and courts will
[02:15:11.420 --> 02:15:15.060]  overturn it but still it happens because if you're a student in a university
[02:15:15.060 --> 02:15:19.740]  and you're not blocking a busy walkway or whatever because I've read the
[02:15:19.740 --> 02:15:23.140]  regulations in the laws and seen the court rulings you can stand in a
[02:15:23.140 --> 02:15:27.740]  commons and hand out literature universities are supposed to be the
[02:15:27.740 --> 02:15:31.420]  most open the most free and they're becoming the least open the least free
[02:15:31.420 --> 02:15:36.020]  Steve Watson reports video cop threatened student with jail for handing
[02:15:36.020 --> 02:15:40.100]  out pocket constitutions you can't do it out here otherwise I'm going to have to
[02:15:40.100 --> 02:15:46.140]  lock you up when the cop is sworn a oath to the Constitution that says that he
[02:15:46.140 --> 02:15:50.260]  has a right to assemble peacefully and for redress of grievance video has
[02:15:50.260 --> 02:15:54.100]  emerged of two students the College of DuPage University in Illinois being
[02:15:54.100 --> 02:15:57.460]  threatened with these students on let's come on out he knows guys being
[02:15:57.460 --> 02:16:01.540]  threatened with arrest by a cop for handing out pocket constitutions the day
[02:16:01.540 --> 02:16:05.860]  after Constitution Day I guess this has come out now after the incident the two
[02:16:05.860 --> 02:16:09.740]  students were also handing out flyers the state of America is a free speech
[02:16:09.740 --> 02:16:12.820]  shown when they were approached by officer who subsequently threatened to
[02:16:12.820 --> 02:16:16.260]  take them to jail and some will say well they were out there baiting the cop
[02:16:16.260 --> 02:16:21.420]  well absolutely showing this is going on because it's the same college I've seen
[02:16:21.420 --> 02:16:28.620]  that has fined people for doing this before the footage shows student Joseph
[02:16:28.620 --> 02:16:32.820]  Enders asking the officer what are the rules for doing this kind of stuff on
[02:16:32.820 --> 02:16:36.340]  campus you go to the student life office and they give you a permit to do so the
[02:16:36.340 --> 02:16:39.780]  officer replies you can't have everybody out here doing this officer states
[02:16:39.780 --> 02:16:43.620]  adding otherwise you'd have stuff lined up here everybody handing out a
[02:16:43.620 --> 02:16:47.300]  different view a different point so you can't do that well a college is supposed
[02:16:47.300 --> 02:16:50.940]  to be like that wow university students voicing is playing their opinions in
[02:16:50.940 --> 02:16:56.140]  America the horror the second student Cara Hamilton then comments so like free
[02:16:56.140 --> 02:17:00.460]  speech it's not free speech man the officer asserts claiming that nobody
[02:17:00.460 --> 02:17:04.420]  stopping you from free speech but you solicit out here the basically you are
[02:17:04.420 --> 02:17:08.460]  you're soliciting your opinion so see now putting your opinion out is
[02:17:08.460 --> 02:17:13.620]  soliciting well that's free speech okay quote in the cop okay and you need to go
[02:17:13.620 --> 02:17:18.220]  get a permit the exchange continues with Enders asking is speech a commodity
[02:17:18.220 --> 02:17:22.180]  well you're handing out pamphlets and stuff like that that's exactly what it
[02:17:22.180 --> 02:17:25.260]  would mean the officer response let's go to some of this video and some of this
[02:17:25.260 --> 02:17:28.220]  audio here it is
[02:17:29.740 --> 02:17:33.140]  correct and they do have rules so but you got to go to the student life and see if
[02:17:33.140 --> 02:17:36.220]  you can get a permit to do so you can't just do it whenever you want so just like
[02:17:36.220 --> 02:17:42.220]  excuse me is there is there a what is your guys rules for the you know doing
[02:17:42.220 --> 02:17:45.220]  this kind of stuff on campus what are your guys
[02:17:45.220 --> 02:17:49.540]  you got to go to public you got to go to the students life you got to go to the
[02:17:49.540 --> 02:17:53.900]  student life on today they give you a permit to do so so you need a permit to
[02:17:53.900 --> 02:17:56.540]  yeah we can't because you can't have everybody out there doing this okay
[02:17:56.540 --> 02:17:59.980]  otherwise you have stuff lined up all along here everybody have a different
[02:17:59.980 --> 02:18:06.140]  view and a different point it's not free speech otherwise you'd have
[02:18:06.140 --> 02:18:10.580]  everyone out here with a different point of view that's what a college is for
[02:18:10.580 --> 02:18:13.420]  this is what they've turned them into what was the other big college was a
[02:18:13.420 --> 02:18:17.580]  Dartmouth Paul to the story on a few months ago that said there is no free
[02:18:17.580 --> 02:18:22.240]  speech on campus get used to it in the official handbook I mean this is the
[02:18:22.240 --> 02:18:27.340]  arrogant attitude let's go back to the so-called police officer it's not free
[02:18:27.340 --> 02:18:30.860]  speech man always stopping you from free speech but you can't solicit out there
[02:18:30.860 --> 02:18:34.940]  what basically what you're trying you're soliciting your opinions it pause that's
[02:18:34.940 --> 02:18:40.500]  an opinion and soliciting your opinion is free speech soliciting is coming to
[02:18:40.500 --> 02:18:43.940]  somebody's doors who sell them something on private property not a perceived
[02:18:43.940 --> 02:18:47.900]  public comments so this police officer hasn't read the statutes and hasn't
[02:18:47.900 --> 02:18:54.500]  read the case law here it is you need to go get a permit is a small site is it a
[02:18:54.500 --> 02:19:02.220]  commodity like a speech a commodity so what's the permit for that we need

[02:21:03.700 --> 02:21:06.940]  understand this is supposed to be the freest most open area for the
[02:21:06.940 --> 02:21:11.340]  dissemination of free speech and then I'm gonna be able to show people handing

[02:22:09.340 --> 02:22:13.380]  read the California College student was blocked last year from handing out

[02:22:31.020 --> 02:22:34.740]  going to basically try to start government lawsuits threatening $10,000
[02:22:34.740 --> 02:22:41.900]  fines and getting $700 fines if you go hey lady we cut men's hair that's clearly
[02:22:41.900 --> 02:22:51.140]  not discrimination it's what you do as a business it's how they operate

[02:30:11.980 --> 02:30:15.940]  reason why communism and socialism has persevered for so long in Latin America
[02:30:15.940 --> 02:30:20.020]  and it's not a coincidence that Cuba's current leader Raul Castro raised Pope
[02:30:20.020 --> 02:30:24.300]  Francis for his anti-capitalist stance Castro like Francis was also brought up

[02:33:42.380 --> 02:33:48.220]  public roads that's right ladies and gentlemen and sex reassessment is
[02:33:48.220 --> 02:33:54.820]  latest company benefit in push for equality as they add the chemicals of
[02:33:54.820 --> 02:34:00.220]  the food and water to further confuse the public sexuality moving us towards an
[02:34:00.220 --> 02:34:05.820]  asexual system where you know what there can be no sexualism there can be no
[02:34:05.820 --> 02:34:10.020]  culture of any type everything's just gray or you're offending someone else
[02:34:10.020 --> 02:34:14.420]  who would have ever thought that's from Bloomberg business that they would
[02:34:14.420 --> 02:34:18.220]  actually now be saying ban the word mother and father husband and wife boy
[02:34:18.220 --> 02:34:23.860]  and girl you see it moves from except everyone to you can't be a man or a
[02:34:23.860 --> 02:34:32.340]  woman that hurts somebody else's feelings it's not tolerance it's not like
[02:34:32.340 --> 02:34:38.820]  I'm tolerant of the you know LD leather daddy on South Park it's that it's that
[02:34:38.820 --> 02:34:43.260]  in the future that'll be banned too because it's hurtful of someone who

[02:35:04.860 --> 02:35:08.220]  days for a few weeks and he should be telling you about his experience in
[02:35:08.220 --> 02:35:12.780]  Eastern Europe with the immigrants oh I'm sorry that's not the word I'm supposed
[02:35:12.780 --> 02:35:18.060]  to use now the migrants the the refugees we'll be talking to Pat here in just a
[02:35:18.060 --> 02:35:24.700]  moment again more of the news breaking on info wars.com there is quite a bit of
[02:35:24.700 --> 02:35:29.420]  it right up there that's very important Russian Marines are battling ISIS now
[02:35:29.420 --> 02:35:36.100]  officially in Syria that is red-linked by Kit Daniels up on info wars.com we
[02:35:36.100 --> 02:35:42.820]  also again have Obama supporter signing a petition to Newt North Korea that is
[02:35:42.820 --> 02:35:51.180]  linked up on drudgereport.com on the left-hand side as well now Pat Riley
[02:35:51.180 --> 02:35:58.060]  joins us in studio because this morning I was working out with him and he started
[02:35:58.060 --> 02:36:03.500]  talking about what he saw with the refugees and I said you know you sent me
[02:36:03.500 --> 02:36:08.660]  a lot of great photos text me a lot of great photos I'm certainly envious of
[02:36:08.660 --> 02:36:13.340]  Croatia certainly envious of how beautiful Turkey is I've seen footage
[02:36:13.340 --> 02:36:17.700]  before when we sent a film crew to Turkey out of cover Bilderberg of what it
[02:36:17.700 --> 02:36:23.180]  looks like there I mean it looks like looks like Tantooine you know meets
[02:36:23.180 --> 02:36:29.060]  East Texas meets Canada I mean just the weird way the different landscapes come
[02:36:29.060 --> 02:36:32.780]  together wild stuff but that's not unfortunately while you're here with us
[02:36:32.780 --> 02:36:39.500]  Pat repeat to the viewers and listeners out there what you experienced on your
[02:36:39.500 --> 02:36:45.220]  trip what you saw what the locals in Turkey said because we have footage we
[02:36:45.220 --> 02:36:49.540]  can show in the background while you're talking of the news media saying a father
[02:36:49.540 --> 02:36:53.820]  and his children were going to commit suicide on the tracks they were all so
[02:36:53.820 --> 02:36:57.020]  upset that they couldn't be led into Hungary well it turns out he was
[02:36:57.020 --> 02:37:00.700]  throwing them out of the tracks or their baby will drown and then they
[02:37:00.700 --> 02:37:04.620]  position it for the news cameras who knows what really happened I mean this
[02:37:04.620 --> 02:37:08.980]  is professional level guilt tripping that's going on when the Middle East
[02:37:08.980 --> 02:37:12.780]  isn't taking any of these refugees Saudi Arabia started all these wars all
[02:37:12.780 --> 02:37:16.620]  these invasions they've not taken one single person they've got trillions and
[02:37:16.620 --> 02:37:20.460]  trillions of dollars they buy everybody basically that dropped bombs on Yemen
[02:37:20.460 --> 02:37:24.980]  gets a $300,000 new Bentley you know why don't they give $300,000
[02:37:24.980 --> 02:37:29.060]  Bentley's to the immigrants we're sick of being told we've got to pay for it all
[02:37:29.060 --> 02:37:34.060]  so thanks for coming in to repeat the amazing story where you saw someone
[02:37:34.060 --> 02:37:38.700]  faking suicide if they didn't get more money and it was totally rigged and then
[02:37:38.700 --> 02:37:42.940]  you talked to locals that confirm that so Pat Riley please tell us what you saw
[02:37:42.940 --> 02:37:48.700]  well I had a chance to go to Italy Montenegro Croatia and Turkey and while
[02:37:48.700 --> 02:37:53.260]  in Turkey in Istanbul we were walking around Taksim Square and after dinner
[02:37:53.260 --> 02:37:57.220]  we were just around the square thinking about a second dinner and all of a
[02:37:57.220 --> 02:38:00.980]  sudden some commotion broke out and everybody was surrounding the Taksim
[02:38:00.980 --> 02:38:05.540]  Square Hotel right there on the edge of the square and all of a sudden things
[02:38:05.540 --> 02:38:09.460]  started getting thrown out from the window and the windows open slightly and
[02:38:09.460 --> 02:38:13.260]  we noticed that half of the chair was hanging out and there was a gentleman
[02:38:13.260 --> 02:38:18.900]  with like a white shirt with his back to the windows sitting down and all of a
[02:38:18.900 --> 02:38:21.940]  sudden you know everybody started screaming don't jump don't jump and
[02:38:21.940 --> 02:38:30.180]  there was a Syrian refugee woman with her kids sitting there and she kept
[02:38:30.180 --> 02:38:34.420]  saying we need money this is this is a translation I heard this is you know
[02:38:34.420 --> 02:38:39.140]  this is what we've been pushed to do you know my husband's gonna jump it's we
[02:38:39.140 --> 02:38:44.020]  need money to get us you know further to Germany further into Europe and people
[02:38:44.020 --> 02:38:47.940]  just started shelling out money left and right but long story short he didn't
[02:38:47.940 --> 02:38:53.260]  jump it maybe happened between 12 and 15 minutes before I guess he allowed some
[02:38:53.260 --> 02:38:58.180]  people in the room but he completely broke through the glass and several
[02:38:58.180 --> 02:39:02.580]  times it looked like he was going to go ahead and jump now when you described
[02:39:02.580 --> 02:39:06.380]  the story to me in a telephone you said he had his chair back up against it
[02:39:06.380 --> 02:39:09.900]  ramming through the glass leaning back saying I'm gonna go I'm gonna go and then
[02:39:09.900 --> 02:39:15.860]  she was down below screaming and crying positioned to then give me money give me
[02:39:15.860 --> 02:39:19.020]  money to focus on the street during all this emotion and that you were told by
[02:39:19.020 --> 02:39:23.620]  the local Turks well repeat all that stuff you told me right so essentially
[02:39:23.620 --> 02:39:29.340]  you know that was the night of the 16th I believe in September I previously that
[02:39:29.340 --> 02:39:33.060]  day as well as the following day was trying to negotiate a purchase of a
[02:39:33.060 --> 02:39:37.740]  carpet and had a discussion with the owner of the company why was it just
[02:39:37.740 --> 02:39:41.300]  free you you'd migrated there from Texas why do they just give you a carpet
[02:39:41.300 --> 02:39:46.580]  they owed it to me yeah so or their racist and probably a little bit of that
[02:39:46.580 --> 02:39:50.180]  too but you know it was sad he said essentially this happens two to three
[02:39:50.180 --> 02:39:53.580]  times a week there's always these suicide attempts and it's just a ploy and
[02:39:53.580 --> 02:39:57.180]  because did you ever ask yourself essentially how they were able to afford
[02:39:57.180 --> 02:40:01.100]  that hotel you know myself I was spending the night in a cheap dormitory
[02:40:01.100 --> 02:40:05.700]  hostel you know it was around 12 13 euros a night this hotel probably was
[02:40:05.700 --> 02:40:10.180]  at least 200 American 150 to 200 American nobody ever questioned you know
[02:40:10.180 --> 02:40:13.660]  essentially how he is in the room if that in fact was even you know the
[02:40:13.660 --> 02:40:18.620]  husband but she kept screaming my husband my husband so you know he he said
[02:40:18.620 --> 02:40:21.380]  essentially this happens all the time and her children with her correct correct
[02:40:21.380 --> 02:40:24.540]  and she was using them as a that's a great well that's what the gypsies do in
[02:40:24.540 --> 02:40:27.180]  Europe and when you got to see it to believe it they'll take their first
[02:40:27.180 --> 02:40:32.100]  born whatever and maim it break the arm twist it burn it with acid and then the
[02:40:32.100 --> 02:40:35.380]  childhoods are going begging and then you're supposed to give them money and
[02:40:35.380 --> 02:40:39.140]  it's like well it's their culture to maim their children and well I guess it
[02:40:39.140 --> 02:40:42.420]  was the Nazis culture to kill everybody then you know I don't support any of that
[02:40:42.420 --> 02:40:46.260]  no we have to learn to discriminate against cultures that are twisted and
[02:40:46.260 --> 02:40:51.420]  corrupt I mean it's just a fact it's wrong to torture your children and it's
[02:40:51.420 --> 02:40:55.260]  wrong in Afghanistan to rape children but here it is in the New York Times US
[02:40:55.260 --> 02:41:00.180]  soldiers told to ignore sexual abuse of boys by Afghan allies soon it's going to
[02:41:00.180 --> 02:41:04.820]  be I am a pedophile foe well I am a pedophile foe keep your damn hands off
[02:41:04.820 --> 02:41:09.100]  the kids well sorry Pat go ahead no well the sad thing was he was telling me
[02:41:09.100 --> 02:41:11.900]  essentially you know there's a number of jobs that they could have you know
[02:41:11.900 --> 02:41:15.820]  behind-the-scenes type of deal you know cleaning tables busing tables working
[02:41:15.820 --> 02:41:19.700]  for the city cleaning the streets and they essentially would only make I think
[02:41:19.700 --> 02:41:24.380]  the equivalent to 2025 and American or like a hundred Turkish lira but you were
[02:41:24.380 --> 02:41:27.140]  saying he said there they could live to you know decent yeah so they're
[02:41:27.140 --> 02:41:31.060]  apparently every day you know they they stand a chance to bring in to 400 lira
[02:41:31.060 --> 02:41:35.540]  you know and I don't want the the amount of money I saw you know that was
[02:41:35.540 --> 02:41:38.860]  gifting to her was I mean outrageous I mean she probably made a thousand more
[02:41:38.860 --> 02:41:42.740]  than a thousand lira which allegedly can you know get her where she needs to go
[02:41:42.740 --> 02:41:47.100]  for the next two to three months but I think this is every few weeks go check
[02:41:47.100 --> 02:41:51.180]  into a hotel knock the windows out and then because it's a delicate immigrant
[02:41:51.180 --> 02:41:53.940]  though thank you for knocking your windows out thank you for running the
[02:41:53.940 --> 02:41:58.540]  scan oh we worship you everything's free I mean this is sick I should ask for a
[02:41:58.540 --> 02:42:02.540]  free hotel room and then just go threaten to kill yourself don't throw
[02:42:02.540 --> 02:42:05.820]  lots of cash in your you're you'll be worshipped but apparently they're they're
[02:42:05.820 --> 02:42:09.620]  playing the tourists every day and it's just a really sad attempt to know that
[02:42:09.620 --> 02:42:15.900]  that's not real well Pat Riley is here with us you dropped by occasionally and
[02:42:15.900 --> 02:42:19.380]  hang out at the studio they've been gone for three weeks but you were there in
[02:42:19.380 --> 02:42:24.060]  Europe during the midst of this all I gotta say is the Croatia photos man where
[02:42:24.060 --> 02:42:29.260]  is that like you were at? Plitvich Lakes and Kerka were two national parks that I
[02:42:29.260 --> 02:42:32.980]  went to and I told the quite quite nice you were telling me the women are
[02:42:32.980 --> 02:42:36.780]  particularly not good looking in that area not at all not at all my wife was
[02:42:36.780 --> 02:42:39.780]  happy to know that there were some extremely unattractive women there so
[02:42:39.780 --> 02:42:43.860]  that you know there's your wife went for two weeks but then you went for
[02:42:43.860 --> 02:42:49.340]  three correct but you were a good boy I was very good of course good man all
[02:42:49.340 --> 02:42:53.340]  right the women are ugly the women are ugly continue proceed but you said the
[02:42:53.340 --> 02:42:56.260]  further you go east the better looking they get absolutely total torture and
[02:42:56.260 --> 02:43:02.700]  sound Patrick Riley says that certified delicious women the food was good too but
[02:43:02.700 --> 02:43:04.980]  you know the feminists they were not supposed to compliment women because
[02:43:04.980 --> 02:43:08.940]  they control women that's their territory they run the women and most top
[02:43:08.940 --> 02:43:13.740]  feminists I understand are lesbians and so they want like a like a giant
[02:43:13.740 --> 02:43:20.140]  elephant seal out there with their harem my women my women can we show some
[02:43:20.140 --> 02:43:24.300]  some elephant seals dominant elephant seals and so they're just telling us
[02:43:24.300 --> 02:43:27.620]  stay away from their women but I just want to tell all of no where we're
[02:43:27.620 --> 02:43:35.460]  muscling into the table no women my women that's only fair you want to do a
[02:43:35.460 --> 02:43:40.740]  elephant seal imitation now I'm calling that yeah you ever you might say you
[02:43:40.740 --> 02:43:43.740]  secretly go to a beach and pick up all the women well I mean that's that's a
[02:43:43.740 --> 02:43:47.100]  mating ritual isn't it I'm serious like I they've noticed in Italy like the bigger
[02:43:47.100 --> 02:43:53.620]  fatter arrogant guys all the big boys pulling up on the yachts you know in
[02:43:53.620 --> 02:43:59.220]  in like a tour and split and in Var an island you said to be like Russians
[02:43:59.220 --> 02:44:03.100]  with like 30 tons of Russians going through Budva you know you see all the
[02:44:03.100 --> 02:44:08.620]  mega yachts outside and it's just it's impressive well that's an example of
[02:44:08.620 --> 02:44:12.780]  crony capitalism I see the male see the male he's let's get some audio here I
[02:44:12.780 --> 02:44:15.700]  mean that's that's a beauty I mean there's a top feminist and she says look
[02:44:15.700 --> 02:44:19.420]  these women are mine yeah I should have tried to bite kind of looks like the new
[02:44:19.420 --> 02:44:27.620]  Supreme Court justice anyways can we get some audio please oh my gosh but it's a
[02:44:27.620 --> 02:44:32.020]  horrible trip you know I'll probably never go back ugly country ugly woman
[02:44:32.020 --> 02:44:35.700]  of course you're being sarcastic absolutely it's gorgeous I'd recommend
[02:44:35.700 --> 02:44:40.220]  what is ugly women means means emergency danger will Robinson absolutely
[02:44:40.220 --> 02:44:51.100]  must vacate must leave now must escape must run yes well I tell you no no but
[02:44:51.100 --> 02:44:54.620]  where do you think this whole immigrant things going where people say you must
[02:44:54.620 --> 02:44:58.220]  accept all these foreigners you must pay for everything you must pay for
[02:44:58.220 --> 02:45:01.940]  everybody sex changes you must pay for everybody's abortions I mean I'm sick of
[02:45:01.940 --> 02:45:06.260]  people telling me I've got to pay for all this stuff was American you know I
[02:45:06.260 --> 02:45:10.780]  only ran into people mostly from like New York or maybe California however
[02:45:10.780 --> 02:45:13.380]  everybody was saying well you should take some of these refugees and I go do
[02:45:13.380 --> 02:45:16.140]  you need to know that we better on migration problem now you don't have a
[02:45:16.140 --> 02:45:19.980]  migration problem we have a migration problem like there's superseded ours like
[02:45:19.980 --> 02:45:22.980]  that you know you need to take some Syrian refugees refugees on top of
[02:45:22.980 --> 02:45:26.740]  whatever you know alleged migration issue you have and most of them by the way
[02:45:26.740 --> 02:45:31.740]  are not Syrian ride shotgun with us Pat Riley is here any closing comments
[02:45:31.740 --> 02:45:37.420]  though on watching clearly this fake suicide attempt that that you know ties
[02:45:37.420 --> 02:45:41.380]  in can we roll in the background the footage just for TV viewers of the
[02:45:41.380 --> 02:45:45.380]  father throwing his children on the tracks because the media like this was
[02:45:45.380 --> 02:45:49.140]  this beautiful wonderful thing that was going on no it's sickening but see if
[02:45:49.140 --> 02:45:54.180]  it's a precious immigrant then it's beautiful it just said you know you
[02:45:54.180 --> 02:45:57.300]  you hate to see people struggle as you walk through the streets everybody's you
[02:45:57.300 --> 02:46:01.620]  know that's a tourist is having a good time you know walking around seeing the
[02:46:01.620 --> 02:46:06.260]  shops having a few drinks buying carpets and these women you know are doing
[02:46:06.260 --> 02:46:12.260]  this this this song this pleading song of you know you know you should feel
[02:46:12.260 --> 02:46:16.460]  guilty you should give me money and every corner you take every half a block
[02:46:16.460 --> 02:46:24.620]  you know you see you did a rendition of this for me this morning can you
[02:46:24.620 --> 02:46:30.980]  something like that and you know their native tongue it's you know it's it's
[02:46:30.980 --> 02:46:34.660]  the most interesting form of begging I've ever seen been to fall down to that
[02:46:34.660 --> 02:46:38.740]  like I was in Rome and I was so shocked by it I had my iPhone but I didn't get
[02:46:38.740 --> 02:46:43.220]  footage of it because I was just so stunned by it these three gypsies walk
[02:46:43.220 --> 02:46:47.740]  over and they've got like this looks like a three-foot tall old woman but it's
[02:46:47.740 --> 02:46:52.660]  not and they just pull the veil off and I knew about the scam so it was real
[02:46:52.660 --> 02:46:55.700]  though and clearly this person had been dipped in battery acid when they were a
[02:46:55.700 --> 02:47:01.180]  baby and it was this mutated tortured person and they just pull it off and
[02:47:01.180 --> 02:47:06.500]  it's just like and I'm supposed to go oh thank you for torturing your child I
[02:47:06.500 --> 02:47:10.900]  worship you your culture so beautiful they have this thing at UT where you
[02:47:10.900 --> 02:47:14.140]  know you're supposed to adopt the gypsy culture and all the stuff and I get the
[02:47:14.140 --> 02:47:17.260]  fact there are some gypsy bands that don't rob everybody and aren't into all
[02:47:17.260 --> 02:47:22.340]  the stuff but I mean that's a fact they do this in Europe it's a fact that that
[02:47:22.340 --> 02:47:27.220]  is this culture it is a fact that it's predatory it is a fact they mutilate
[02:47:27.220 --> 02:47:31.620]  their children it is a fact that they inbreed it is a fact they have genetic
[02:47:31.620 --> 02:47:37.700]  disorders it is a fact and I will not worship it I'm done I'm not worshiping
[02:47:37.700 --> 02:47:41.500]  it and I'm against torturing children I'm against mutilating children and I'm
[02:47:41.500 --> 02:47:44.740]  against raping children but the US military is ordered to cover it up
[02:47:44.740 --> 02:47:48.260]  New York Times you heard to hear a month ago how sick is that Riley it's
[02:47:48.260 --> 02:47:52.860]  absolutely atrocious now you're being now you're being a pedophile fob
[02:47:52.860 --> 02:47:56.300]  apparently I'm at everything is that was it was called the waitest because I
[02:47:56.300 --> 02:48:01.060]  sat next to a 350 pound Turkish man who was overflowing by about six to eight
[02:48:01.060 --> 02:48:05.580]  inches on me an hour on the tarmac two hours in the air I put a picture up on
[02:48:05.580 --> 02:48:10.180]  social media and a hashtag fat Turkish and people said that that wasn't quite
[02:48:10.180 --> 02:48:15.020]  nice but he had have the C-bell extender to sit in the chair when I got up from
[02:48:15.020 --> 02:48:17.820]  the three hours of sitting next to my right shoulder and I have a photo
[02:48:17.820 --> 02:48:20.940]  actually my right shoulder was completely wet from his sweat so now I'm
[02:48:20.940 --> 02:48:25.220]  awaited as well as a sex one time I was on a coach airplane flight back for some
[02:48:25.220 --> 02:48:30.320]  TV show in LA with a guy that I'm not exaggerating probably weighed 500
[02:48:30.320 --> 02:48:34.460]  pounds and I know it never taken a bath he had the most nasty hell on earth
[02:48:34.460 --> 02:48:37.980]  smell I've ever smelled onions and garlic on your food not on your people
[02:48:37.980 --> 02:48:43.340]  right well I think I'm supposed to just shove my head up under his arm and
[02:48:43.340 --> 02:48:49.260]  worship him but that's what it is it's a bunch of thugs scum parasites trash of
[02:48:49.260 --> 02:48:53.700]  every race color and creed that want to intimidate the producers into bowing
[02:48:53.700 --> 02:48:58.020]  down to them and being their slaves so this is literally a giant hoard and a
[02:48:58.020 --> 02:49:01.980]  gang with all these different gangs of filth that team up together to make
[02:49:01.980 --> 02:49:08.340]  producers builders serve them and I'm sick of it I mean it's Atlas shrug man
[02:49:08.340 --> 02:49:13.060]  well you know you shouldn't people shouldn't let them you know the beggars
[02:49:13.060 --> 02:49:16.300]  like that detour them from going to countries like that however it's a
[02:49:16.300 --> 02:49:19.260]  dime a dozen it's everybody with the same story just like here have you seen
[02:49:19.260 --> 02:49:21.700]  the gypsies where they have the deformed children absolutely it's I mean it's
[02:49:21.700 --> 02:49:24.860]  just the same thing is going up to Hank I mean why aren't you for dipping your
[02:49:24.860 --> 02:49:28.620]  child in battery acid well I guess I need to how dare you not accept their
[02:49:28.620 --> 02:49:33.060]  culture I have to accept it and hey did your wife wear a long many long skirt
[02:49:33.060 --> 02:49:43.060]  to be respectful of course you know what they say you submit racist filth white trash scum absolutely good
[02:49:43.060 --> 02:49:48.500]  all right let's go to a caller stay here Riley sunny in Nevada you're on the air
[02:49:48.500 --> 02:49:57.460]  welcome thank you Alex I appreciate it hey basically I'm calling because I do
[02:49:57.460 --> 02:50:02.900]  love the Apple Wars show and I agree with most the everything extra series
[02:50:02.900 --> 02:50:08.940]  a lot of a gerbil's method of propaganda being used in the United States and and
[02:50:08.940 --> 02:50:13.940]  it's just human nature I mean I believe it is you know that's just survival the
[02:50:13.940 --> 02:50:18.180]  fittest you know get eliminate the weak and I don't believe it's just racial
[02:50:18.180 --> 02:50:23.940]  against the static it's against anyone who proceeds to be weak it's the power
[02:50:23.940 --> 02:50:28.500]  elite working with weak groups to make them angry and to feel like they've been
[02:50:28.500 --> 02:50:32.300]  messed with to make them aggressive and gang members now that's an over some
[02:50:32.300 --> 02:50:38.100]  occasion well well the middle class is being diverted there that there are
[02:50:38.100 --> 02:50:42.660]  two teams I've heard it's one area then they're not being able to focus on what's
[02:50:42.660 --> 02:50:47.740]  really going on like going down to the root of the actual problem so if you
[02:50:47.740 --> 02:50:51.220]  can you see a bunch of immigrants coming in about either immigrants are coming
[02:50:51.220 --> 02:50:54.940]  here to take this to come here to take that oh undoubtedly immigrants have been
[02:50:54.940 --> 02:50:58.540]  used to skate goats in every culture in every history immigrants make a lot of
[02:50:58.540 --> 02:51:01.300]  contributions there's also a lot of negatives throughout history depending
[02:51:01.300 --> 02:51:04.420]  on the time the period the area the circumstances the economics the socio
[02:51:04.420 --> 02:51:07.780]  economic interactions and larger geopolitical ramifications of the
[02:51:07.780 --> 02:51:12.220]  sociological interface that has to be looked at in a wide spectrum actuary of
[02:51:12.220 --> 02:51:16.620]  the overall system but if you pull back from all that and look at government
[02:51:16.620 --> 02:51:21.340]  welfare directing culture war the New World Order wants your guns it one it
[02:51:21.340 --> 02:51:25.140]  wants open borders it wants to make you pay for somebody to have a sex change I
[02:51:25.140 --> 02:51:29.380]  don't care if some guy wants to go in and have the doctor you know get rid of
[02:51:29.380 --> 02:51:34.380]  this you know what is Johnson the issue is I paying for it and I'm not gonna be
[02:51:34.380 --> 02:51:38.260]  bullied into paying for it which I already am because they said I was
[02:51:38.260 --> 02:51:43.460]  against them it's a load of bull I'm not against any of these transgender people
[02:51:43.460 --> 02:51:48.660]  I'm not I'm sick of them being used as a litmus test to force all this on me God
[02:51:48.660 --> 02:51:53.100]  bless you sonny any comments on that Patrick J Riley you're absolutely right
[02:51:53.100 --> 02:51:58.700]  you know his middle name is not J I'm not paid for it either J for drama
[02:51:58.700 --> 02:52:03.660]  anyways all right let's go ahead and take another call Dan in Indiana you're
[02:52:03.660 --> 02:52:06.980]  on the air welcome
[02:52:06.980 --> 02:52:11.180]  I just had a comment on TSA and the quick fixer on the flight everybody stopped
[02:52:11.180 --> 02:52:14.980]  flying wouldn't take very long they change that real quick well they've
[02:52:14.980 --> 02:52:18.020]  already cut back a little bit because of folks quit and flying or losing 30
[02:52:18.020 --> 02:52:22.460]  billion a year in tourism but it's just continuing to some extent I mean they
[02:52:22.460 --> 02:52:26.420]  hadn't messed with me in a while but I guess I just forgot about this you know
[02:52:26.420 --> 02:52:31.380]  they thought smuggled jelly jelly smeller but but oh here's the key the whole
[02:52:31.380 --> 02:52:34.820]  TSA deal make your point sir and then I'll make my final point on the TSA I
[02:52:34.820 --> 02:52:40.960]  haven't made yet go ahead yeah I was just saying I did strip search for and
[02:52:40.960 --> 02:52:45.020]  cavity search that's just not good you know I don't be subjected to any of that
[02:52:45.020 --> 02:52:49.660]  anymore well you know the Beavis and but had movie Beavis then thinks that he's
[02:52:49.660 --> 02:53:05.860]  finally scored when they search all right God bless you sir you know this gets to
[02:53:05.860 --> 02:53:09.580]  me Riley doesn't it a little bit I mean you should be you know you should be a
[02:53:09.580 --> 02:53:13.980]  little angered about it everybody should have the people don't even know what if
[02:53:13.980 --> 02:53:16.980]  one of you decide you want to have the government pay for your dog to have a
[02:53:16.980 --> 02:53:20.980]  sex change well I think I think if the dog wants to sex change they owe it to
[02:53:20.980 --> 02:53:25.260]  the dog to provide facilities and care for it and then what do you do like have
[02:53:25.260 --> 02:53:30.580]  buttons the dog pushes but even if it doesn't really want one like one is
[02:53:30.580 --> 02:53:33.900]  filet mignon hits one button the other's chicken so it'll choose filet mignon
[02:53:33.900 --> 02:53:41.420]  that means sex change and so the dog runs up and then it's a segue well I'm
[02:53:41.420 --> 02:53:47.020]  just saying that's how preposterous at all absolutely and again we wouldn't be
[02:53:47.020 --> 02:53:51.940]  covering it except it's the number one news story constantly I bought like five
[02:53:51.940 --> 02:53:55.620]  magazines when I flew up to Omaha to read there and back and I read basically
[02:53:55.620 --> 02:54:00.060]  all five of them and it was just all social engineering you know I can say
[02:54:00.060 --> 02:54:04.220]  that I've been throughout most of Southeast mainland Asia and it's very
[02:54:04.220 --> 02:54:08.780]  custom for you to run into ladyboys and gangs of ladyboys and you know they're
[02:54:08.780 --> 02:54:12.980]  not wanting a whole you know new spread and you know a TV show about them and
[02:54:12.980 --> 02:54:16.380]  you know all the sudden you know Caitlyn Jenner comes in the picture and
[02:54:16.380 --> 02:54:19.380]  everybody you know is concerned with well the point is why do you have to pay
[02:54:19.380 --> 02:54:22.940]  for it I'm just it's not even a moral judgment I shouldn't have to pay for it
[02:54:22.940 --> 02:54:27.820]  I want to go to some more phone calls but here's the key to the TSA deal the TSA
[02:54:27.820 --> 02:54:31.020]  people some of them were really rude some of them were somewhat apologetic this
[02:54:31.020 --> 02:54:34.940]  is one of like 35 minutes they said listen we get fired if we don't do this
[02:54:34.940 --> 02:54:40.420]  exactly the way they say so I got patted down twice interrogated about my jelly
[02:54:40.420 --> 02:54:44.540]  and I was just I got missed my plane that's fine just act arrogant powerful
[02:54:44.540 --> 02:54:47.820]  I don't care well why do you have this jelly and I said I just forgot man I
[02:54:47.820 --> 02:54:50.580]  thought I lived in a free country you know there's some produce in there too
[02:54:50.580 --> 02:54:57.500]  excuse me for buying local well you can go but you know you better watch it you
[02:54:57.500 --> 02:55:02.260]  know you're lucky I'm just like no man you're not lucky that we live in a
[02:55:02.260 --> 02:55:07.420]  country like this this is a joke people like come on man hurry up you know they're
[02:55:07.420 --> 02:55:10.700]  like what's this guy's got a problem here land of the free home of the brave
[02:55:10.700 --> 02:55:14.380]  where our government funds al-qaeda and ISIS and open borders and buses the
[02:55:14.380 --> 02:55:18.860]  illegals in and pays for everything but I can't have jelly it's all just social
[02:55:18.860 --> 02:55:23.380]  conditioning and here's what was said they told me it's not our choice we're
[02:55:23.380 --> 02:55:27.860]  just doing our jobs and that's what zero tolerance is about it's about these
[02:55:27.860 --> 02:55:34.820]  people have no leeway to make their own personal decision as a TSA agent they
[02:55:34.820 --> 02:55:39.300]  just are robots they follow total orders here's this guy with no criminal record
[02:55:39.300 --> 02:55:42.620]  he's clearly bought some stuff at the farmers market he's got a thing of
[02:55:42.620 --> 02:55:47.140]  Concord grape jelly I said take the jelly and they go oh no we got a test that we
[02:55:47.140 --> 02:55:50.180]  got open it up we got to ask you questions about it and I couldn't sit
[02:55:50.180 --> 02:55:54.620]  there with a straight face I go man and I know they ate it that night or that
[02:55:54.620 --> 02:55:59.940]  next morning it's it's not funny well now you're probably labeled as a jelly
[02:55:59.940 --> 02:56:04.100]  smuggler should really think about that it had been fine if it was old suitcase
[02:56:04.100 --> 02:56:09.780]  of dead babies been sold to Planned Parenthood and then there's the comment
[02:56:09.780 --> 02:56:13.020]  or someone were like I bet you just did that to get attention oh yeah like I
[02:56:13.020 --> 02:56:17.220]  need to get attention on the TSA like I want to get grape jelly and just throw
[02:56:17.220 --> 02:56:20.420]  it in my back I didn't think about it the hotel room I'm like hurrying getting
[02:56:20.420 --> 02:56:23.660]  packed I'm through the grape jelly in there I can't believe I'm even
[02:56:23.660 --> 02:56:27.540]  discussing this Gerald oh by the way really five minutes of overdrive here
[02:56:27.540 --> 02:56:30.460]  and then the whole next hour David Knight's gonna be hosting the new fourth
[02:56:30.460 --> 02:56:35.820]  hour we're bringing back cold war heats up as Russia media stops calling Russian
[02:56:35.820 --> 02:56:39.620]  troops a little green men and admits boots on the ground they've been there
[02:56:39.620 --> 02:56:45.820]  for years Kerry keeps upping the number of migrants he says from Syria it's now
[02:56:45.820 --> 02:56:53.580]  85,000 what's behind the rise of Fox candidate du jour the ornia pope coming
[02:56:53.580 --> 02:56:59.980]  to America preaching climatology I love that and socialism Autobots and talking

[02:57:13.620 --> 02:57:20.140]  bomb I that proves to those of us who are true believers that God is the one
[02:57:20.140 --> 02:57:25.260]  that they're supporting you so you can get this so it can use you to get this
[02:57:25.260 --> 02:57:29.540]  end-time message out so well God bless you brother and thanks for putting up
[02:57:29.540 --> 02:57:32.820]  when I'm goofy in the third hour sometimes but yes sir the fact that we
[02:57:32.820 --> 02:57:36.780]  got a million dollars in will really help us with a satellite and reach tens of
[02:57:36.780 --> 02:57:40.820]  millions more it's a big deal it's a big responsibility and I'll do my best not
[02:57:40.820 --> 02:57:49.020]  to let you down God bless you sir one quick thing the the terminology of our
[02:57:49.020 --> 02:57:53.700]  English language has been perverted that's why we're having such a hard
[02:57:53.700 --> 02:58:00.140]  time yes sir I mean that's why we can't communicate with a lot of people now
[02:58:00.140 --> 02:58:04.980]  because the language has been changed altered or reduced it's scary anything
[02:58:04.980 --> 02:58:10.660]  else yeah think about it the word legal the word lawful under the common law
[02:58:10.660 --> 02:58:15.660]  it's not called common legal is called common law they bastardize it now
[02:58:15.660 --> 02:58:20.580]  everything is legal tender but the Constitution says no state to make
[02:58:20.580 --> 02:58:27.420]  anything but golden silver is a payment of debt so if Satan has twisted this
[02:58:27.420 --> 02:58:34.140]  thing around to where it's all upside down absolutely upside down world we're

[03:01:15.980 --> 03:01:24.980]  riding shotgun with us. Chris in Kentucky on Jesse Ventura go ahead I've been
[03:01:24.980 --> 03:01:29.940]  listening to you for about four years and I love Jesse I've been listening to him
[03:01:29.940 --> 03:01:35.060]  for a while but getting painful to hear him I mean he sounds like he's gone full
[03:01:35.060 --> 03:01:40.140]  socialist. No I agree and I was telling Anthony Gutierrez and Buckley during a
[03:01:40.140 --> 03:01:42.860]  break and I'm gonna call Ventura and just kind of telling this today because you
[03:01:42.860 --> 03:01:46.220]  know I've defended him I like him I think he's a guy who's for real he believes
[03:01:46.220 --> 03:01:49.820]  what he's saying but you know them when I'm arguing with him and he's getting
[03:01:49.820 --> 03:01:54.460]  most the time it's kind of like some of the other interviews where folks then
[03:01:54.460 --> 03:01:58.420]  just don't like me arguing with him and and and he really seemed irritated
[03:01:58.420 --> 03:02:02.660]  absolutely and he kind of just hung up at the end and it was just kind of like
[03:02:02.660 --> 03:02:08.060]  whoa because he's to be more libertarian and and I mean Bernie Sanders as far as
[03:02:08.060 --> 03:02:12.580]  I'm concerned go to hell and so can Hillary Clinton all these people you
[03:02:12.580 --> 03:02:16.380]  know I went after Bush and folks too with Ventura but he was more libertarian
[03:02:16.380 --> 03:02:22.580]  than and it's just it's just it's just you know I can see his angles on some
[03:02:22.580 --> 03:02:26.300]  political issues but I mean our borders wide open we're paying for
[03:02:26.300 --> 03:02:30.620]  everything free and he said well don't be racist you know it's not the Mexicans
[03:02:30.620 --> 03:02:34.460]  that are gonna get us I never said that and that's it that's cheap shot you know
[03:02:34.460 --> 03:02:40.460]  to play the race card and it's that's what it's very easy really your mic was
[03:02:40.460 --> 03:02:45.540]  off for you say Pat it was an easy shot by the race card yeah it just doesn't
[03:02:45.540 --> 03:02:50.900]  work anymore though but folks see the demographics and there's this idea not
[03:02:50.900 --> 03:02:55.020]  by Ventura by the media that they're gonna turn Hispanics into this racial
[03:02:55.020 --> 03:02:59.300]  block and so you submit to the Borg and that's the new culture and then you give
[03:02:59.300 --> 03:03:04.500]  your culture when it's just that's not it's not a melting pot that's being gone
[03:03:04.500 --> 03:03:08.500]  with it it's a political conquering led by a Latin American communist pope
[03:03:08.500 --> 03:03:11.980]  everybody's getting in line for the new power structure and guess what I'm not
[03:03:11.980 --> 03:03:18.980]  doing it anything else Chris yeah you know one other it kind of seems like he
[03:03:18.980 --> 03:03:22.860]  would be a Jesse would be one of those guys on my peers answering the wrong
[03:03:22.860 --> 03:03:27.860]  question to mark dice and speaking of that he mark dice is another guy I mean
[03:03:27.860 --> 03:03:33.220]  he went by Mark Sheldice he's just fell books on how to pick up chicks and out of
[03:03:33.220 --> 03:03:37.300]  mind control people and I don't think that I read his books I don't and he's
[03:03:37.300 --> 03:03:41.060]  attacked me before too but I don't care I just don't care I love it all you know I
[03:03:41.060 --> 03:03:45.540]  love Ventura I love Mark dice okay and if your name Sheldice you boil it down
[03:03:45.540 --> 03:03:50.300]  and say dice it's like a German slash Polish name I mean you know whatever and
[03:03:50.300 --> 03:03:55.300]  you know what I love it when Mark dice you know got mad at me and stuff that
[03:03:55.300 --> 03:03:57.820]  attacked me I mean it made for great entertainment I forgive him and it's
[03:03:57.820 --> 03:04:03.140]  okay I mean I just don't care look he produces really good stuff he he does
[03:04:03.140 --> 03:04:08.580]  funny things everybody grows nobody's perfect and then Ventura I mean I like
[03:04:08.580 --> 03:04:14.500]  Jesse but I tell you he is taking a big leftist turn I like the guy that doesn't
[03:04:14.500 --> 03:04:18.460]  like both parties I like the guy that wants to expose 9-11 that's the guy you
[03:04:18.460 --> 03:04:22.760]  know who wouldn't shove about the war and got fired from the MSNBC and lost you
[03:04:22.760 --> 03:04:26.820]  know a lot of money I mean I admire him for stuff like that so I like Ventura I
[03:04:26.820 --> 03:04:31.220]  just think he can't handle me arguing with it you know I think that's the
[03:04:31.220 --> 03:04:36.460]  issue and so that's fine listen I'm out of time we'll be able to get to Dion
[03:04:36.460 --> 03:04:42.020]  Scott and Tim if you want to hold over when the great David Knight who folks

[03:04:56.860 --> 03:05:03.780]  transmission continues Alex Jones harassed by TSA over jar of grape jelly
[03:05:03.780 --> 03:05:07.660]  that's right radio host Alex Jones had another run-in with the TSA after agent
[03:05:07.660 --> 03:05:10.600]  searched his bag and found a jar of grape jelly Jones said he went through the
[03:05:10.600 --> 03:05:14.380]  airport body scanner and a physical pat down but the TSA agents insisted upon
[03:05:14.380 --> 03:05:17.980]  searching his bags after finding the jar of grape jelly the agents told Jones he
[03:05:17.980 --> 03:05:21.660]  was lucky they would still allow him to fly after such a violation Jones
[03:05:21.660 --> 03:05:25.780]  recapped on the Sunday show they searched me for 35 minutes and I barely made my
[03:05:25.780 --> 03:05:29.580]  plane and they got such enjoyment out of it meanwhile last week federal air
[03:05:29.580 --> 03:05:32.920]  marshals were under investigation for filming sex with a prostitute while on
[03:05:32.920 --> 03:05:36.620]  duty the two air marshals based in Chicago allegedly used government issued
[03:05:36.620 --> 03:05:39.420]  phones to record their own sexual encounters with a prostitute and then
[03:05:39.420 --> 03:05:42.260]  shared them on their personal email accounts which they connected to their
[03:05:42.260 --> 03:05:45.940]  work phones according to the TSA and remember TSA demands the highest
[03:05:45.940 --> 03:05:48.740]  standards of integrity and professionalism let's hope if there's a
[03:05:48.740 --> 03:05:52.380]  hijacking and air marshals are aboard they pull out the right gun Rob do

[03:08:07.660 --> 03:08:14.340]  war continues it's alex jones and the GCN radio network
[03:08:16.220 --> 03:08:21.060]  welcome to the alex jones show the wrap up and overdrive of the fourth hour I'm
[03:08:21.060 --> 03:08:24.900]  david night your host we've got a host of issues here they're going to talk
[03:08:24.900 --> 03:08:28.740]  about one of them of course is an article that's up on info wars dot com
[03:08:28.740 --> 03:08:32.260]  today half of americans believe the federal government to be an immediate
[03:08:32.260 --> 03:08:37.740]  threat to freedom my question is why so low what is it that they don't
[03:08:37.740 --> 03:08:41.620]  understand when you look at the situation we just had alex jones reported
[03:08:41.620 --> 03:08:45.660]  about yesterday as he was flying he was hassled detained for 35 minutes
[03:08:45.660 --> 03:08:49.300]  searched lectured threatened maybe they put him on a no-fly list who knows
[03:08:49.300 --> 03:08:53.380]  because they don't tell you if they put you on a no-fly list you're not allowed
[03:08:53.380 --> 03:08:56.900]  to know until the next time you try to fly and then they take you off what did
[03:08:56.900 --> 03:09:04.140]  he have he had a bottle of grape jelly what did they think that was what what
[03:09:04.140 --> 03:09:08.700]  what does grape jelly look like that is a possible threat I really don't
[03:09:08.700 --> 03:09:12.420]  understand and they think he was trying to ship live anthrax anthrax no that's
[03:09:12.420 --> 03:09:16.780]  the Department of Defense that does that on a regular basis or weaponized
[03:09:16.780 --> 03:09:20.740]  bubonic plague no they did that as well shipping that through ups they don't fly
[03:09:20.740 --> 03:09:26.820]  commercial airlines they use ups to ship their live bio weapons in the mail but
[03:09:26.820 --> 03:09:31.780]  what if he had shown up at the airport with a suitcase bomb like Ahmed
[03:09:31.780 --> 03:09:35.740]  Muhammad the 14 year old kid or I think that's his first name his last names
[03:09:35.740 --> 03:09:40.580]  Muhammad the 14 year old kid that Obama is going to honor at the White House
[03:09:40.580 --> 03:09:44.260]  what if you took something that looked like that to the airport I'm not
[03:09:44.260 --> 03:09:47.740]  recommending you do it there will probably haul you off and no one will
[03:09:47.740 --> 03:09:50.620]  ever hear from you again because we don't have anything such as a due process
[03:09:50.620 --> 03:09:55.140]  anymore in this country can you imagine if you took something like that to the
[03:09:55.140 --> 03:09:57.940]  airport and ran it through their screeners I mean maybe they wouldn't
[03:09:57.940 --> 03:10:01.740]  notice I mean that it is after all security theater that it might just
[03:10:01.740 --> 03:10:04.700]  sail through and nobody had paid any attention but if it did get drawn to
[03:10:04.700 --> 03:10:08.940]  their attention I guarantee you you wouldn't get an invitation to the White
[03:10:08.940 --> 03:10:13.140]  House I guarantee it and of course as we've mentioned over and over again
[03:10:13.140 --> 03:10:18.180]  Obama has no problems whatsoever with an out of control police department that
[03:10:18.180 --> 03:10:21.460]  is encamped in our schools I can't even believe that we have that in the schools
[03:10:21.460 --> 03:10:26.780]  I would is so far removed from anything that I grew up in anything that my
[03:10:26.780 --> 03:10:30.900]  wife caught in and that was just a couple of decades ago we are so rapidly
[03:10:30.900 --> 03:10:35.900]  falling into tyranny I can't understand why only half of the people believe that
[03:10:35.900 --> 03:10:39.640]  the federal government is an immediate threat to freedom it's not a threat it's
[03:10:39.640 --> 03:10:42.860]  already taking your freedoms it's already telling you that everything you
[03:10:42.860 --> 03:10:47.820]  have has to be sacrificed to national security not just your money and taxes
[03:10:47.820 --> 03:10:51.860]  but also every right every bit because your rights are property as well it's
[03:10:51.860 --> 03:10:55.420]  not just your money your property to go to pay for an out of control government
[03:10:55.420 --> 03:10:59.220]  that is involved in war after war after war and I want to talk about that in
[03:10:59.220 --> 03:11:03.580]  just a moment but let's first talk about the boogeyman in Russia or as the story
[03:11:03.580 --> 03:11:07.820]  came out on RT and they're talking about the government there is going to ban
[03:11:07.820 --> 03:11:13.100]  GMO food production in Russia they have already put they've already banned the
[03:11:13.100 --> 03:11:18.180]  importation of GMO food they said a group of MPs backed by parliamentary
[03:11:18.180 --> 03:11:22.700]  majority party United Russia drafted a bill that severely restricted the
[03:11:22.700 --> 03:11:26.860]  imports of genetically modified agricultural produce and completely
[03:11:26.860 --> 03:11:32.660]  banned its domestic production now this is after they say this draft has not
[03:11:32.660 --> 03:11:36.260]  passed through the parliament but later in the year the state Duma approved a
[03:11:36.260 --> 03:11:40.020]  package of amendments imposing fines on businesses that sell products containing
[03:11:40.020 --> 03:11:45.140]  GMO without adequate labeling to warrant consumers what a difference what a
[03:11:45.140 --> 03:11:50.740]  difference why is it that in this country even people who typically stand for
[03:11:50.740 --> 03:11:55.700]  informed consent and stand for choice stand for freedom people like Rand Paul
[03:11:55.700 --> 03:12:02.900]  would support the dark act that's what we call it telling a forbidding state
[03:12:02.900 --> 03:12:06.340]  governments from telling people honestly what's in their food we're not even
[03:12:06.340 --> 03:12:11.620]  allowed to know so not only are they are we allowed to have this stuff put into
[03:12:11.620 --> 03:12:15.620]  our food they're going to try to ban it in Russia but we have people who are
[03:12:15.620 --> 03:12:20.940]  trying to facilitate it trying to hide the fact that this is in the food why
[03:12:20.940 --> 03:12:26.860]  do they not want it on the label because people don't want it in their food it's
[03:12:26.860 --> 03:12:32.260]  just honesty it's not over regulation because the government should be there
[03:12:32.260 --> 03:12:37.820]  as a referee to prevent force or fraud that's what I agree with as a
[03:12:37.820 --> 03:12:41.980]  libertarian I think government ought to be there as an honest referee to stop
[03:12:41.980 --> 03:12:48.460]  people from robbing you using force on you or ripping you off when they steal
[03:12:48.460 --> 03:12:51.820]  from you when they deceive you then they ought to go to prison if we're going to
[03:12:51.820 --> 03:12:56.500]  use government that's what we should use it for have an honest open free market
[03:12:56.500 --> 03:13:00.380]  where people know what's in their food but they call it the safe and accurate
[03:13:00.380 --> 03:13:05.100]  food act it's not at all that it's an attempt by the federal government to
[03:13:05.100 --> 03:13:11.180]  shut down any information about what's in your food and it is a violation of the
[03:13:11.180 --> 03:13:15.580]  Tenth Amendment when Rand Paul was defending this he said that he was
[03:13:15.580 --> 03:13:19.980]  torn between the two because there were really bad pieces of legislation that
[03:13:19.980 --> 03:13:22.700]  were working their way through in the state legislatures but he didn't like
[03:13:22.700 --> 03:13:24.900]  the idea that federal government was going to do it you know what I don't
[03:13:24.900 --> 03:13:29.940]  either because the Tenth Amendment does says that unless they specifically are
[03:13:29.940 --> 03:13:34.140]  given that power they don't have the power we ought to be eviscerating the
[03:13:34.140 --> 03:13:38.740]  FDA if you ran on a on a platform we said I'm going to stop the FDA from
[03:13:38.740 --> 03:13:43.820]  withholding drugs from cancer patients that would be huge you hear me Donald
[03:13:43.820 --> 03:13:47.700]  Trump and you're about the only one that has the courage to say something that
[03:13:47.700 --> 03:13:52.220]  radical because the rest of these guys are just gonna tow the corporate line
[03:13:52.220 --> 03:13:56.020]  that we've seen from the big mega establishment but of course that
[03:13:56.020 --> 03:14:00.780]  establishment interestingly enough is pushing hard to get Hillary Clinton in
[03:14:00.780 --> 03:14:04.700]  this is an article up on info wars today establishment Democrats are working
[03:14:04.700 --> 03:14:09.460]  hard to push Clinton over Sanders now this is an organization and we've we've
[03:14:09.460 --> 03:14:16.060]  seen not only are they pushing to get her end but also there in many cases some
[03:14:16.060 --> 03:14:19.780]  of the bigger ones are from the bigger corporations are starting to abandon
[03:14:19.780 --> 03:14:24.140]  Clinton they certainly don't want Bernie Sanders they're concerned about Bernie
[03:14:24.140 --> 03:14:26.980]  Sanders I don't think that he's controllable for them but I think that
[03:14:26.980 --> 03:14:31.660]  Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton are I think Joe is Biden his time I think he's
[03:14:31.660 --> 03:14:36.460]  gonna pop into the race and we see that Hillary Clinton drops 20 points in the
[03:14:36.460 --> 03:14:40.380]  South Carolina poll that was on September the 9th we see that the
[03:14:40.380 --> 03:14:44.900]  person that picks up those is not Bernie Sanders there necessarily it is Joe Biden
[03:14:44.900 --> 03:14:49.500]  who seems to be picking up this so the establishment I think has got two horses
[03:14:49.500 --> 03:14:53.540]  in this race Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden and I think that they're going to put
[03:14:53.540 --> 03:14:58.340]  themselves behind Joe Biden at the end I think there's a lot of people who even
[03:14:58.340 --> 03:15:01.940]  though Hillary Clinton is very well connected with a Democrat establishment
[03:15:01.940 --> 03:15:05.620]  I think there's a lot of people in the Democrat establishment that are afraid
[03:15:05.620 --> 03:15:10.820]  of her that perhaps the Clintons could blackmail I think they're afraid of that
[03:15:10.820 --> 03:15:14.620]  mafia so they look at somebody that probably they could deal with a little
[03:15:14.620 --> 03:15:18.220]  bit more easily like Joe Biden and I don't support him I mean this is just
[03:15:18.220 --> 03:15:21.620]  politics gamesmanship that I see happening here now the article that we
[03:15:21.620 --> 03:15:28.580]  have that Kurt Nemo wrote today he said a CNN orc poll ORC I guess the orcs I
[03:15:28.580 --> 03:15:32.620]  guess they're polling orcs I'm a conductive between September 11th and
[03:15:32.620 --> 03:15:37.500]  the 19th if that can be trusted Clinton is supported by 42% Bernie Sanders at
[03:15:37.500 --> 03:15:42.540]  24 Joe Biden who's yet to declare his entry into the races at 22% just two
[03:15:42.540 --> 03:15:47.380]  points behind Bernie Sanders that's why I think he could rapidly take over
[03:15:47.380 --> 03:15:52.460]  because look this this is a guy who you have to ask yourself how in the world
[03:15:52.460 --> 03:15:57.340]  did a guy from the smallest state in the Union who doesn't really bring any
[03:15:57.340 --> 03:16:00.380]  voting block or any connection there he certainly had to be politically
[03:16:00.380 --> 03:16:06.300]  connected to get in as the vice president for Obama and he seems to
[03:16:06.300 --> 03:16:10.540]  have a lot of connections and if you saw the the interview that he had with
[03:16:10.540 --> 03:16:15.940]  Stephen Colbert it was a puff-piece interview but he did a great job coming
[03:16:15.940 --> 03:16:21.020]  across of course we know that he's prone to gaffes but that doesn't seem to be a
[03:16:21.020 --> 03:16:24.640]  problem this time around people are looking for someone that they think is
[03:16:24.640 --> 03:16:28.900]  authentic and if you misspeak that simply makes you sound authentic to them no
[03:16:28.900 --> 03:16:33.140]  matter how well connected with the establishment you are now on the other
[03:16:33.140 --> 03:16:36.500]  side of things even though there are people still in the Democratic Party
[03:16:36.500 --> 03:16:39.900]  who are still trying to push Clinton and I believe that there's others who are
[03:16:39.900 --> 03:16:43.580]  trying to drive her out if they can get her down with this email scandal that
[03:16:43.580 --> 03:16:47.060]  would be something where they could take her down without getting themselves
[03:16:47.060 --> 03:16:51.740]  involved but with her financial backers we see a couple of days ago on
[03:16:51.740 --> 03:16:56.380]  September 19th USA Today reported that big businesses are abandoning the
[03:16:56.380 --> 03:17:00.940]  Clinton global initiative that sounds pretty sinister doesn't it the Clinton
[03:17:00.940 --> 03:17:05.340]  global initiative yeah it's actually actually is sinister actually has a
[03:17:05.340 --> 03:17:11.620]  globalist plot it is a nonprofit arm of the Clinton dynasty USA Today says but
[03:17:11.620 --> 03:17:14.740]  some of the investment company at some of the large corporations the mega
[03:17:14.740 --> 03:17:19.300]  corporations that have pulled out of donating to that right now are Samsung
[03:17:19.300 --> 03:17:25.500]  Exxon Mobil, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Price Waterhouse Coopers, Big Counting Firm,
[03:17:25.500 --> 03:17:30.380]  Hewlett Packard, Monsanto and Dow. So some of these high-profile corporations as
[03:17:30.380 --> 03:17:34.220]  they say might not be the only supporters backing away from association with the
[03:17:34.220 --> 03:17:40.260]  Clinton family charitable arm in 2014 eight national leaders kings presidents
[03:17:40.260 --> 03:17:44.400]  prime ministers appeared on the program for the Clinton global initiative
[03:17:44.400 --> 03:17:49.740]  annual meeting now this year only two leaders one from Columbia and another
[03:17:49.740 --> 03:17:56.300]  one from Liberia are on the program how's that for a drop in your self-esteem
[03:17:56.300 --> 03:17:59.740]  when you've just got two leaders one from Columbia and the other one from
[03:17:59.740 --> 03:18:04.620]  Liberia most Americans probably couldn't find those two countries but
[03:18:04.620 --> 03:18:07.740]  nevertheless I think that's going to move in the way of Joe Biden now on the
[03:18:07.740 --> 03:18:14.540]  other side we've got Carly Fiorina moving up rapidly in the polls and I
[03:18:14.540 --> 03:18:19.220]  want to take a look at that and and also what Donald Trump says he's going to
[03:18:19.220 --> 03:18:23.900]  spend a hundred million dollars to win the presidency that used to be a lot of
[03:18:23.900 --> 03:18:29.380]  money that used to be the entire amount of money going back to the early early
[03:18:29.380 --> 03:18:35.580]  days of the American Republic you know like 2000 George Bush spent a hundred
[03:18:35.580 --> 03:18:38.340]  million dollars in Al Gore Q's and we're trying to buy the election remember
[03:18:38.340 --> 03:18:43.180]  that well Donald Trump could spend that on his own but that's going to be pretty
[03:18:43.180 --> 03:18:47.700]  small compared to the amount of money that people are raising and spending
[03:18:47.700 --> 03:18:51.820]  today hundreds of millions I think one of the I think it was the last time that
[03:18:51.820 --> 03:18:56.140]  Obama ran I'm just pulling from memory here I think it was something like 600
[03:18:56.140 --> 03:19:00.460]  million or more that Obama had because you know those big corporations like we
[03:19:00.460 --> 03:19:04.340]  just listed Monsanto Hewlett Packard Deutsche Bank HSBC they're the ones
[03:19:04.340 --> 03:19:08.780]  getting involved in this and they have changed the way that corporations can
[03:19:08.780 --> 03:19:13.460]  get involved they've also changed the party rules however that's a report from
[03:19:13.460 --> 03:19:18.940]  the New York Times they say party rules meant to streamline the race may backfire
[03:19:18.940 --> 03:19:23.660]  for the GOP you remember that the GOP was very very frightened about the rise
[03:19:23.660 --> 03:19:27.540]  of Ron Paul they wanted to make sure that was never going to happen again that
[03:19:27.540 --> 03:19:31.340]  they were never going to have to embarrass themselves by publicly rigging
[03:19:31.340 --> 03:19:37.260]  the primaries and the caucuses as we saw them do and caught them red-handed so
[03:19:37.260 --> 03:19:40.880]  what they did was they tried to rush things up and they're saying that this
[03:19:40.880 --> 03:19:45.460]  may actually backfire on the GOP establishment it may actually make it
[03:19:45.460 --> 03:19:50.060]  easier for Donald Trump to get the nomination and certainly he's saying
[03:19:50.060 --> 03:19:55.220]  things and saying them in a way that the other candidates in the GOP feared to
[03:19:55.220 --> 03:19:58.780]  tread when we come back though we're going to take a look at the rising

[03:24:15.820 --> 03:24:20.180]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host in this news wrap
[03:24:20.180 --> 03:24:25.020]  up the fourth hour the Alex Jones show we have a breaking news article that was
[03:24:25.020 --> 03:24:28.740]  just handed to me by Kit Daniels media promotes pedophile rights not long
[03:24:28.740 --> 03:24:32.460]  after same-sex marriage ruling leftists are now demanding rights for four
[03:24:32.460 --> 03:24:37.580]  pedophiles they say the leftist media is promoting this as the next social
[03:24:37.580 --> 03:24:43.140]  justice movement salon.com published an op-ed by self-described pedophile
[03:24:43.140 --> 03:24:48.460]  asking Americans to quote learn to accept pedophiles and to be quote
[03:24:48.460 --> 03:24:54.300]  understanding and supportive of their sexual orientation this is now a sexual
[03:24:54.300 --> 03:25:01.380]  orientation praying on young children what do we expect when we despise the
[03:25:01.380 --> 03:25:06.780]  idea anymore in America of consent we despise the idea of consent when it
[03:25:06.780 --> 03:25:10.900]  comes to what's in your food what's in your medicine what medicines you will
[03:25:10.900 --> 03:25:15.340]  take what medicines you'll be injected with we're not informed and they don't
[03:25:15.340 --> 03:25:19.180]  want our consent when it comes to trade treaties that are going to remake our
[03:25:19.180 --> 03:25:24.300]  economy remake our government they don't want our consent and so why would
[03:25:24.300 --> 03:25:30.460]  they care about the consent of children because you can't give consent as a child
[03:25:30.460 --> 03:25:33.980]  that's what we've always understood we've always understood that children
[03:25:33.980 --> 03:25:39.580]  are especially vulnerable because children are easily manipulated and so
[03:25:39.580 --> 03:25:44.540]  we've always had an age of consent that has varied back and forth over the years
[03:25:44.540 --> 03:25:49.100]  over different societies but we all understand children need to be protected
[03:25:49.100 --> 03:25:56.300]  because they are not able to give consent that's why pedophilia is wrong
[03:25:56.300 --> 03:26:00.820]  let me make that very simple for you it's one of the key reasons why it's wrong
[03:26:00.820 --> 03:26:07.180]  you can never have mutual consent by definition this is another example of
[03:26:07.180 --> 03:26:14.420]  our government selling this evil because of a brave new world philosophy it's
[03:26:14.420 --> 03:26:19.460]  exactly like Aldous Huxley's Brave New World they kept the vast majority of the
[03:26:19.460 --> 03:26:26.300]  population under control by keeping them in this hedonistic stupor that's
[03:26:26.300 --> 03:26:30.260]  precisely what's going on in our society people go back and forth we've had we've
[03:26:30.260 --> 03:26:34.300]  talked about this before do we live in a 1984 world do we live in an Aldous
[03:26:34.300 --> 03:26:39.500]  Huxley's Brave New World well actually you live in both the vast majority of
[03:26:39.500 --> 03:26:44.260]  the people if they can be controlled they go for them first with a brave new
[03:26:44.260 --> 03:26:50.300]  world dumbing down if somehow that idiocracy that you are fed in school
[03:26:50.300 --> 03:26:55.180]  fed in the media fed by the politicians if that doesn't work then what they give
[03:26:55.180 --> 03:27:01.140]  you is the full Orwellian 1984 treatment total surveillance to identify those who
[03:27:01.140 --> 03:27:06.340]  were going to stand out from amongst the dumbed it down idiocracies that's the
[03:27:06.340 --> 03:27:11.420]  whole idea behind activity-based intelligence human domain analytics the
[03:27:11.420 --> 03:27:15.980]  geospatial intelligence is predictive they want to see who pops up it's just
[03:27:15.980 --> 03:27:22.980]  that simple you know as an old saying in Japan in terms of making conformity we
[03:27:22.980 --> 03:27:26.260]  had some friends who were Japanese and they said I can't remember the exact
[03:27:26.260 --> 03:27:31.820]  expression but it's essentially the head that pops up gets hammered down there
[03:27:31.820 --> 03:27:36.260]  is a massive effort very successful in Japanese society to make everybody
[03:27:36.260 --> 03:27:41.500]  conform to society's norms the things that are dictated to them the cultural
[03:27:41.500 --> 03:27:46.180]  norms how you should what what it means to be successful that type of thing and
[03:27:46.180 --> 03:27:50.340]  if you deviate from that you were hammered down we are going to be living
[03:27:50.340 --> 03:27:54.940]  in a high-tech society a technocracy is a big new brzezinski looked at that's
[03:27:54.940 --> 03:27:59.340]  going to monitor everything that we do he predicted this a long time ago that's
[03:27:59.340 --> 03:28:02.500]  how they picked him to lead the Trilateral Commission they were very very
[03:28:02.500 --> 03:28:06.780]  happy with the book that he wrote in 1970 talking about the technocracy talking
[03:28:06.780 --> 03:28:12.940]  about merging three global blocks in North America Asia and Europe those being
[03:28:12.940 --> 03:28:16.780]  the stepping stones to a one-world government this has been planned for a
[03:28:16.780 --> 03:28:20.620]  very long time this has always been the dream of tyrants and dictators and the
[03:28:20.620 --> 03:28:24.620]  way they do it even going back to Plato's Republic make sure you destroy the
[03:28:24.620 --> 03:28:29.640]  family make sure you know that that that nobody identifies with a mother and a
[03:28:29.640 --> 03:28:35.980]  father or with a family but only with the state that was Plato's ideal make
[03:28:35.980 --> 03:28:39.820]  sure that they don't know there's not possible for them to even know who their
[03:28:39.820 --> 03:28:45.140]  parents are so the only parent is the state and of course that is precisely
[03:28:45.140 --> 03:28:49.860]  what happened in Huxley's world this is what they're selling us now listen to
[03:28:49.860 --> 03:28:52.900]  this quote this is also from the pedophile who's selling this he says
[03:28:52.900 --> 03:28:56.620]  in essence your brain knows what it likes and it isn't going to take no for
[03:28:56.620 --> 03:29:00.500]  an answer he said in his op-ed for that reason the nature of nurture question
[03:29:00.500 --> 03:29:03.780]  with respect to sexual preferences ultimately irrelevant it all becomes
[03:29:03.780 --> 03:29:09.060]  all hard work hardwired soon enough until it's all you know and it's self
[03:29:09.060 --> 03:29:13.860]  reinforcing no matter how much you wish to dig it out many of us look at that and
[03:29:13.860 --> 03:29:19.060]  say yes unfortunately this man is possessed in many different aspects of
[03:29:19.060 --> 03:29:24.740]  that word with his sexuality this is a way it's going to be sold to us first
[03:29:24.740 --> 03:29:28.940]  it's going to be as he's putting it to us then we're going to see pedophilia
[03:29:28.940 --> 03:29:32.500]  represented in a funny little way we're already seeing that in many different
[03:29:32.500 --> 03:29:36.580]  ways interjected into movies you'll have some sympathetic characters it'll come
[03:29:36.580 --> 03:29:42.220]  along and then they will demand that it is a civil right stay with us we're
[03:29:42.220 --> 03:29:46.060]  going to be right back we're going to talk about ISIS and little green men
[03:29:46.060 --> 03:29:49.820]  that the Russians are finally ex admitting exists not the kind you think
[03:29:49.820 --> 03:29:57.540]  of the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[03:29:59.060 --> 03:30:04.460]  kid Daniels info wars.com did you know that Pope Francis has strong ties to
[03:30:04.460 --> 03:30:07.820]  communism Francis is a member of the Jesuits who developed the so-called
[03:30:07.820 --> 03:30:11.940]  liberation theology which many have labeled Christianized Marxism the other
[03:30:11.940 --> 03:30:15.900]  reason why communism and socialism has persevered for so long in Latin America
[03:30:15.900 --> 03:30:20.020]  and it's not a coincidence that Cuba's current leader Raul Castro praised Pope
[03:30:20.020 --> 03:30:24.260]  Francis for his anti-capitalist stance Castro like Francis was also brought up
[03:30:24.260 --> 03:30:28.660]  by the Jesuits starting to make sense now why Francis is constantly calling for

[03:34:40.380 --> 03:34:43.380]  thank you for hanging on so long you wanted to talk about immigration it
[03:34:43.380 --> 03:34:48.580]  says yeah I did I do want to talk about immigration but I just wanted to
[03:34:48.580 --> 03:34:52.100]  mention real quick because you were talking about the stuff that was going
[03:34:52.100 --> 03:34:56.300]  on in the primaries as far as on the democratic side about them putting up
[03:34:56.300 --> 03:35:01.260]  Joe Biden and place the Hillary and I think the whole thing what that is is
[03:35:01.260 --> 03:35:06.100]  that Bernie Sanders was meant to be the attention getter to get the base route
[03:35:06.100 --> 03:35:10.740]  up and to turn it over to whoever yeah the front runner over there is going to
[03:35:10.740 --> 03:35:15.180]  be because Bernie Sanders is the shield no doubt he was paid off by them to do
[03:35:15.180 --> 03:35:19.580]  that and whether it's going to be Hillary or Joe or something the fact
[03:35:19.580 --> 03:35:23.540]  that they're doing all that stuff behind the scenes they haven't even had a
[03:35:23.540 --> 03:35:28.460]  debate or something that tells you a lot right there about how secretive they
[03:35:28.460 --> 03:35:31.980]  are so it's totally controlled we saw that with the Republican primaries as
[03:35:31.980 --> 03:35:37.300]  I mentioned with Ron Paul when he was running how corrupt the GOP was these
[03:35:37.300 --> 03:35:41.060]  guys don't even pretend to have debates I mean that's how control the Democrat
[03:35:41.060 --> 03:35:46.180]  party is and it really does underscore why we need to have a more much much
[03:35:46.180 --> 03:35:50.900]  much more open electoral systems one of the many things that makes the electoral
[03:35:50.900 --> 03:35:54.220]  system completely rigged completely dysfunctional and that is even just
[03:35:54.220 --> 03:35:58.180]  ballot access or access to the debates we've seen that happen over and over
[03:35:58.180 --> 03:36:02.140]  again but you had a comment about immigration go ahead oh yeah what inspired
[03:36:02.140 --> 03:36:08.100]  me to call in was basically what Jesse Ventura was on and I'm not picking on
[03:36:08.100 --> 03:36:14.020]  him just per state but I noticed with that joke and that whole thing about
[03:36:14.020 --> 03:36:19.140]  all your races that you don't accept the borders and stuff and typically it comes
[03:36:19.140 --> 03:36:23.900]  from these people who do not have dogs in the fight themselves they are off
[03:36:23.900 --> 03:36:29.700]  secluded you know in their own little areas and stuff like that they they're
[03:36:29.700 --> 03:36:34.140]  not amongst you know in these areas where a lot of these immigrants come into
[03:36:34.140 --> 03:36:38.540]  or the illegals come into what is a lot of this inflighting going on in their
[03:36:38.540 --> 03:36:43.620]  cities and stuff like that they put up these arguments about oh well but they're
[03:36:43.620 --> 03:36:47.140]  coming over here for a better life you want to just punish them well I would
[03:36:47.140 --> 03:36:51.660]  say to them okay was it fair to those who were over here who tried to go through
[03:36:51.660 --> 03:36:57.180]  the legal hoop to get here legally and stuff like that it's fair to discard them
[03:36:57.180 --> 03:37:02.780]  I would say you know what hey if you're all accepting about having people come
[03:37:02.780 --> 03:37:06.620]  over here illegally and stuff put up or shut up you buy some of them into your
[03:37:06.620 --> 03:37:11.220]  house you know give it to yourself yeah we heard Nancy Pelosi say that she said
[03:37:11.220 --> 03:37:16.100]  all these people coming we just have we have one community that just happens
[03:37:16.100 --> 03:37:21.340]  have a border running through it I wish I could adopt them all but she didn't did
[03:37:21.340 --> 03:37:25.540]  she didn't adopt a single one precisely what you're talking about look Scott
[03:37:25.540 --> 03:37:31.060]  what it boils down to is just look at the education standpoint of this we
[03:37:31.060 --> 03:37:34.540]  have an explosion in our schools and it's not just providing an education for
[03:37:34.540 --> 03:37:38.260]  them all these children and they're not just all coming from Central and South
[03:37:38.260 --> 03:37:42.700]  America they're coming from all over the world 40 50 60 different languages some
[03:37:42.700 --> 03:37:45.660]  school districts are having to teach these children in because we have to give
[03:37:45.660 --> 03:37:51.660]  them a customized education we don't want them to assimilate heaven forbid
[03:37:51.660 --> 03:37:55.220]  they would assimilate heaven forbid we would have a melting pot that would not
[03:37:55.220 --> 03:38:00.340]  serve the motives of the controlling elite whatsoever it's all about divide and
[03:38:00.340 --> 03:38:05.100]  conquer but it's also a practical aspect we will literally be driven out of our
[03:38:05.100 --> 03:38:08.580]  homes just to pay for the education aspect of it even if it's not in the
[03:38:08.580 --> 03:38:14.220]  other welfare aspects already education budgets are out of control in most cases
[03:38:14.220 --> 03:38:18.300]  that's where the massive property taxes that everyone has to pay are coming from
[03:38:18.300 --> 03:38:22.220]  and if you're not paying the property taxes because you live in a rented
[03:38:22.220 --> 03:38:26.700]  apartment you are still paying it you just don't see it itemized you don't
[03:38:26.700 --> 03:38:30.380]  understand what a huge part of your living expenses that is so are we going
[03:38:30.380 --> 03:38:34.580]  to wind up being homeless in our own country that's one of the aspects of it
[03:38:34.580 --> 03:38:38.620]  I hear people like Jesse Ventura say look we have to understand that unless
[03:38:38.620 --> 03:38:42.780]  we're Native Americans or Indians as Russell means preferred the term Indian
[03:38:42.780 --> 03:38:48.100]  lesser Indians we're all immigrants here well you know what I don't support the
[03:38:48.100 --> 03:38:52.940]  idea that we stole land from the Indians I don't support the idea that we tore up
[03:38:52.940 --> 03:38:55.980]  the treaties that we made with the Indians I think that's horrendous I
[03:38:55.980 --> 03:38:59.780]  think Russell means was right when he said the federal government has
[03:38:59.780 --> 03:39:03.460]  destroyed every treaty it's made with the Indians the treaty they made with you
[03:39:03.460 --> 03:39:07.460]  white man is the Constitution and they have shredded that as well so I'm
[03:39:07.460 --> 03:39:10.180]  concerned about all those things I'm concerned about the practicality of it
[03:39:10.180 --> 03:39:14.900]  we cannot save everyone the obvious example being when you're on a plane
[03:39:14.900 --> 03:39:17.740]  and there's a problem in the air mass come down they say put it on yourself
[03:39:17.740 --> 03:39:22.460]  first you can help people look at this situation in Syria and I'm gonna move on
[03:39:22.460 --> 03:39:26.060]  thank you so much for calling us Scott I want to talk about this situation in
[03:39:26.060 --> 03:39:30.620]  Syria because it's a good example of how they will create a second problem rather
[03:39:30.620 --> 03:39:36.460]  than addressing the root of the problem we have a massive buildup continuing on
[03:39:36.460 --> 03:39:41.580]  we see the breaking story today Russian Marines are battling ISIS in Syria
[03:39:41.580 --> 03:39:45.700]  Russian Marines this is up on info wars.com Russian Marines clashed with
[03:39:45.700 --> 03:39:50.420]  ISIS in Syria on Sunday according to Russian media during the fight the
[03:39:50.420 --> 03:39:54.420]  Marines allegedly killed several militants captured others after ISIS
[03:39:54.420 --> 03:39:59.340]  attempted to an attack an airbase operated by the Russian military brings
[03:39:59.340 --> 03:40:03.820]  up a couple of questions Kit points out interestingly the newspaper also reported
[03:40:03.820 --> 03:40:09.340]  that ISIS militants possessed a detailed plan of the airbase and clear
[03:40:09.340 --> 03:40:14.940]  satellite imagery with the marked key military installations where would they
[03:40:14.940 --> 03:40:20.260]  get that information maybe from the same people that are giving them training
[03:40:20.260 --> 03:40:26.460]  and equipment and support and are smuggling Muslim Chechens into Syria to
[03:40:26.460 --> 03:40:32.860]  fight in that war that would be us even though we pretend that we absolutely
[03:40:32.860 --> 03:40:38.140]  know nothing whatsoever about it go back to the GOP debate for example and of
[03:40:38.140 --> 03:40:43.100]  course this is a question that came up by Hugh Hewitt Hugh Hewitt a radio
[03:40:43.100 --> 03:40:47.060]  personality one of the biggest neocons you'll find out they're always pushing
[03:40:47.060 --> 03:40:52.100]  the any war that he can find and he addressed the question to Donald Trump
[03:40:52.100 --> 03:40:56.380]  he said Mr. Trump two years ago Obama drew a red line that the Syrian
[03:40:56.380 --> 03:41:02.180]  dictator of Assad Assad crossed Obama threatened to strike he didn't his
[03:41:02.180 --> 03:41:06.860]  knees buckled now we've got four million refugees as if that's the reason that
[03:41:06.860 --> 03:41:11.500]  didn't happen we were the ones who were pushing that but Hugh Hewitt couches it
[03:41:11.500 --> 03:41:16.220]  in the position saying you have three senators to your right that said no to
[03:41:16.220 --> 03:41:20.100]  this do they bear responsibility for the refugee crisis what would you have done
[03:41:20.100 --> 03:41:26.500]  when Assad crossed the line really so we go into this area we have now ISIS
[03:41:26.500 --> 03:41:31.300]  commanders who are telling us that they were created by the US military we have
[03:41:31.300 --> 03:41:38.300]  daily revelations about this an ISIS commander in Afghanistan said the same
[03:41:38.300 --> 03:41:43.300]  thing we had the revelations the day of the GOP debate about the head of ISIS
[03:41:43.300 --> 03:41:48.100]  in Syria talking about bringing in Chechen rebels yet we're supposed to
[03:41:48.100 --> 03:41:53.420]  pretend along with the GOP along with Hugh Hewitt that this is something we
[03:41:53.420 --> 03:41:58.580]  had absolutely nothing to do with and that now this war that we started
[03:41:58.580 --> 03:42:03.580]  because we want to take down Assad this war that America started that has been
[03:42:03.580 --> 03:42:08.420]  pushing for multiple years now that because we didn't go in there and do a
[03:42:08.420 --> 03:42:14.100]  knockout punch that now this is all happening we need to stop the war that
[03:42:14.100 --> 03:42:19.780]  we started that we continue in Syria we need to let the Russians kill ISIS
[03:42:19.780 --> 03:42:25.220]  instead of equipping ISIS they are our surrogates just as the Mujahideen just
[03:42:25.220 --> 03:42:31.220]  as they became al-Qaeda they were our Syria our surrogates as well this is an
[03:42:31.220 --> 03:42:35.420]  old game and they keep getting away with it with the American press now what did
[03:42:35.420 --> 03:42:40.060]  Trump say he said I wouldn't have drawn the line but once I drew it once
[03:42:40.060 --> 03:42:45.060]  Obama drew it he had no choice but to go across that line and he said if he had
[03:42:45.060 --> 03:42:48.020]  gone in with tremendous force you wouldn't have millions of people
[03:42:48.020 --> 03:42:51.820]  displaced all over the world and then Hewitt comes back and asks him a follow-up
[03:42:51.820 --> 03:42:55.860]  question now first of all that is absolutely wrong it just would have
[03:42:55.860 --> 03:42:59.700]  happened sooner and Rand Paul points it out but I find it interesting that when
[03:42:59.700 --> 03:43:04.460]  Hewitt asks him a follow-up question Donald Trump says a couple of things and
[03:43:04.460 --> 03:43:08.900]  then he repeats verbatim verbatim if you look at the transcript if he had gone
[03:43:08.900 --> 03:43:11.820]  in with tremendous force you wouldn't have had millions of people displaced
[03:43:11.820 --> 03:43:16.300]  all over the world that's something that they thought about and that's the line
[03:43:16.300 --> 03:43:21.660]  that he's going to stick with that it's our fault because we didn't go in and
[03:43:21.660 --> 03:43:27.940]  presumably nuke Syria to get Assad out now we have this flood of immigrants that
[03:43:27.940 --> 03:43:32.140]  are coming everywhere that's the lie that they're trying to tell you that's the
[03:43:32.140 --> 03:43:36.180]  lie that they're selling you about that and of course the other lie that they're
[03:43:36.180 --> 03:43:41.940]  trying to sell you is the fact that what's going on in the Ukraine that this
[03:43:41.940 --> 03:43:47.540]  is something that is and a piece of Russian aggression we started these
[03:43:47.540 --> 03:43:52.500]  color revolutions we pushed up to those areas and now we've got the Pentagon
[03:43:52.500 --> 03:43:57.140]  wargaming and a Baltic battle against Russia this was reported over the
[03:43:57.140 --> 03:44:01.820]  weekend by foreign policy magazine and we reported it at info wars.com and
[03:44:01.820 --> 03:44:06.460]  what they said was the troubling thing about the war games with Russia and the
[03:44:06.460 --> 03:44:12.100]  Baltic area is that the United States keeps losing really is that really true
[03:44:12.100 --> 03:44:19.020]  or is this really just a play to step up spending for the military industrial
[03:44:19.020 --> 03:44:23.540]  complex I believe that's what this revival of the Cold War is all about
[03:44:23.540 --> 03:44:29.060]  this is an effort to get that profit center ramped up again and so now
[03:44:29.060 --> 03:44:32.980]  they're telling us you know what even though we've got more than half of the
[03:44:32.980 --> 03:44:38.820]  military in the entire world we've got more than half bigger than Russia and
[03:44:38.820 --> 03:44:43.820]  China and the European armies and everybody else combined we just can't
[03:44:43.820 --> 03:44:49.020]  beat the Russians we're gonna have to have more spending military industrial
[03:44:49.020 --> 03:44:52.380]  complex mission accomplished that's what they want to do they want to create a
[03:44:52.380 --> 03:44:56.820]  crisis because they've got the solution prepared and that is a massive arms race
[03:44:56.820 --> 03:45:01.580]  perhaps this time with autonomous killer robots instead of nuclear weapons
[03:45:01.580 --> 03:45:07.620]  maybe that's going to be the crux of the arms race absolute total insanity and
[03:45:07.620 --> 03:45:10.820]  we have an article up on info wars dot com today from Paul Craig Roberts
[03:45:10.820 --> 03:45:13.740]  someone who was high up in the Treasury Department the Republican
[03:45:13.740 --> 03:45:18.500]  administration of Ronald Reagan says all Republican presidential candidates
[03:45:18.500 --> 03:45:23.980]  stand for war it is reckless for Washington to take provocative actions
[03:45:23.980 --> 03:45:28.620]  against Russia and he points out he says Carly Fiorina positioned herself
[03:45:28.620 --> 03:45:34.180]  alongside the macho men as a warmonger she let the military security complex
[03:45:34.180 --> 03:45:39.140]  know that she too was for sale send in the campaign donations that she will see
[03:45:39.140 --> 03:45:42.260]  that the money flows back to the military security complex and the buildup
[03:45:42.260 --> 03:45:46.860]  of fleets and armaments that will send the Russians a message even though she
[03:45:46.860 --> 03:45:51.060]  said she wouldn't talk to Putin she's gonna send him a message with a massive
[03:45:51.060 --> 03:45:54.900]  buildup of equipment and as I pointed out this isn't going to be your
[03:45:54.900 --> 03:45:59.860]  grandfather's military buildup this is going to be something far more horrific
[03:45:59.860 --> 03:46:03.740]  these killer robots are something that they will be able to use and let loose
[03:46:03.740 --> 03:46:09.060]  and confined regions unlike a nuclear war that they were concerned about
[03:46:09.060 --> 03:46:14.020]  getting going to a full doctor strange love scenario but it quite frankly could
[03:46:14.020 --> 03:46:18.340]  turn into a doctor strange love scenario so while they're telling you that we
[03:46:18.340 --> 03:46:21.140]  have to go in and take care of the migrants because we've got this
[03:46:21.140 --> 03:46:26.180]  humanitarian crisis that's the line that was being sold by Donald Trump before
[03:46:26.180 --> 03:46:30.860]  and during the debate that we didn't do enough we didn't do it big enough hard
[03:46:30.860 --> 03:46:36.460]  enough soon enough that's why we have this crisis not at all actually quite
[03:46:36.460 --> 03:46:40.780]  frankly Rand Paul had a good response and I'm gonna read that to you what he
[03:46:40.780 --> 03:46:44.220]  said was I think this gets to the point of wisdom on when to intervene and when
[03:46:44.220 --> 03:46:49.460]  we shouldn't had we bombed Assad at this time like President Obama wanted and
[03:46:49.460 --> 03:46:53.540]  like Hillary Clinton wanted and many Republicans wanted I think ISIS would be
[03:46:53.540 --> 03:46:58.580]  in Damascus today I think ISIS would be in charge of Syria had we bombed Assad
[03:46:58.580 --> 03:47:04.220]  sometimes both sides of a civil war are evil and sometimes an intervention
[03:47:04.220 --> 03:47:09.100]  sometimes makes us less safe this is the real debate we have to have in the
[03:47:09.100 --> 03:47:13.500]  Middle East every time we've toppled a secular dictator we've gotten chaos the
[03:47:13.500 --> 03:47:19.380]  rise of radical Islam and now we're even at more risk exactly but then what does
[03:47:19.380 --> 03:47:23.580]  Marco Rubio do he chimes in and says well what do you do if you have chemical
[03:47:23.580 --> 03:47:28.500]  weapons that end up in the hands of radical Islamic terrorists like al-Nusrah we
[03:47:28.500 --> 03:47:33.860]  were the ones who put it in their hands it was shown by multiple news
[03:47:33.860 --> 03:47:37.780]  organizations we talked about how that it happened in the past and finally we
[03:47:37.780 --> 03:47:44.460]  had people within the US military leak out the fact that it wasn't sarin gas
[03:47:44.460 --> 03:47:50.980]  from the Syrian government it was something different that was how close
[03:47:50.980 --> 03:47:55.700]  we came to going into a full-scale war but now it is ramping up because we've
[03:47:55.700 --> 03:48:00.340]  got Russian troops that are in the Ukraine in the Crimea as the US is war
[03:48:00.340 --> 03:48:04.780]  gaming there we also have Russian troops that are now in Syria as we saw this
[03:48:04.780 --> 03:48:09.260]  article that I began this with and of course the Russian media has been
[03:48:09.260 --> 03:48:13.340]  referring to these people as little green men they've been a bit more
[03:48:13.340 --> 03:48:16.620]  transparent a lot more transparent I should say than our media our media
[03:48:16.620 --> 03:48:21.540]  pretends that we don't even have American troops American boots on the
[03:48:21.540 --> 03:48:25.740]  ground they've said they're going to put some in but then they've reported that
[03:48:25.740 --> 03:48:28.860]  we have spokespersons for the government saying that they're going to put
[03:48:28.860 --> 03:48:32.100]  people in but they won't actually say that they're there they won't actually
[03:48:32.100 --> 03:48:36.500]  show them it's interesting that in Russia they have been showing them but
[03:48:36.500 --> 03:48:39.900]  then calling them little green men because they put masks over their face
[03:48:39.900 --> 03:48:43.780]  and other things so they can't be identified as Russians we've had
[03:48:43.780 --> 03:48:48.700]  Western soldiers with American accents that we've caught on videotape some
[03:48:48.700 --> 03:48:51.620]  people have caught that and put that up on YouTube to show that we already have
[03:48:51.620 --> 03:48:57.940]  American troops in the Ukraine this is absolute insanity and then on top of this
[03:48:57.940 --> 03:49:03.860]  insanity is the massive migration and the lies behind that piled on top of
[03:49:03.860 --> 03:49:08.340]  everything else we have a story up on info wars.com carry says that the US
[03:49:08.340 --> 03:49:13.900]  will accept 85,000 refugees in 2016 it was just this weekend that Hillary
[03:49:13.900 --> 03:49:18.660]  Clinton was criticizing John Kerry saying you're only going to take 15,000
[03:49:18.660 --> 03:49:25.500]  you should take 65,000 then we hear Kerry says 65,000 I'll raise your 65,000
[03:49:25.500 --> 03:49:32.500]  85,000 and now the latest bid of the hour is in an article that Drudge has
[03:49:32.500 --> 03:49:38.140]  linked 200,000 Kerry is saying see how rapidly this is escalating and just a
[03:49:38.140 --> 03:49:43.500]  couple of days we've gone from 15 to 65,000 to 85,000 now to 200,000 in this
[03:49:43.500 --> 03:49:49.380]  bid to accept refugees into America this is not into Europe this is into
[03:49:49.380 --> 03:49:54.660]  America at the same time we learned that four out of five migrants are not even
[03:49:54.660 --> 03:50:00.220]  from Syria the whole thing is a lie the fact that we need to take these people
[03:50:00.220 --> 03:50:04.260]  the humanitarian crisis is something that we created now they come in and we
[03:50:04.260 --> 03:50:07.500]  say well we need to take these people from Syria and yet four out of the five
[03:50:07.500 --> 03:50:11.100]  of them are not from Syria most of them are single males that are coming in
[03:50:11.100 --> 03:50:15.020]  they're not families that are running in refugees this is an article from the
[03:50:15.020 --> 03:50:20.220]  Daily Mail saying that EU logged 213,000 arrivals in April May and June only
[03:50:20.220 --> 03:50:25.500]  44,000 of those were fleeing the Syrian civil war well where did the rest of
[03:50:25.500 --> 03:50:30.020]  them come from they say many of those who are coming to Europe are doing so for
[03:50:30.020 --> 03:50:33.980]  economic reasons not for humanitarian reasons and of course we could easily
[03:50:33.980 --> 03:50:39.260]  stop the humanitarian crisis but they say the number of Afghans looking for
[03:50:39.260 --> 03:50:46.880]  asylum has gone up four-fold from 6,300 to 27,000 another 17,700 claims are made
[03:50:46.880 --> 03:50:52.620]  by Albanians whose country is at peace this is what we're looking at and of
[03:50:52.620 --> 03:50:56.940]  course how do you vet the people to know that you're not letting in jihadists
[03:50:56.940 --> 03:51:00.820]  how do you vet people to know who they are you don't with open borders that's
[03:51:00.820 --> 03:51:04.860]  the point we'll be right back

[03:53:58.980 --> 03:54:16.380]  welcome back to the last segment of the Alex Jones radio show I'm David Knight
[03:54:16.380 --> 03:54:22.100]  here in the fourth hour and the news wrap-up we were just talking about the
[03:54:22.100 --> 03:54:26.380]  massive problems with immigration in both Europe and now we're making that
[03:54:26.380 --> 03:54:31.700]  problem our own we've got John Kerry in a bidding war with Hillary Clinton as to
[03:54:31.700 --> 03:54:37.180]  who can accept the most migrants into the United States were all told that
[03:54:37.180 --> 03:54:42.460]  they're coming from Syria that they are humanitarian refugees nevertheless a
[03:54:42.460 --> 03:54:48.380]  very small percentage of them are as we just pointed out but is Saudi Arabia
[03:54:48.380 --> 03:54:51.980]  going to do anything to help these refugees yes they have come up finally
[03:54:51.980 --> 03:54:57.380]  with an offer to help them they offered to build 200 mosques in Germany how's
[03:54:57.380 --> 03:55:01.380]  that that's help isn't it they're not gonna let any of them go to Saudi Arabia
[03:55:01.380 --> 03:55:08.820]  we've got our our closest Arab ally Saudi Arabia bombing Yemen targeting
[03:55:08.820 --> 03:55:14.860]  civilians and yet we ignore that humanitarian crisis and they won't take
[03:55:14.860 --> 03:55:19.300]  any refugees into Saudi Arabia it was only about 10 days ago that Paul Joseph
[03:55:19.300 --> 03:55:24.340]  Watson talked about Saudi Arabia having 100,000 air-conditioned tents that can
[03:55:24.340 --> 03:55:28.460]  house 3 million people that would be something where they could take some
[03:55:28.460 --> 03:55:32.460]  refugees and put them there in a temporary facility but they're not
[03:55:32.460 --> 03:55:36.660]  about to do that those of course are there because of the Islamic pilgrimages
[03:55:36.660 --> 03:55:41.660]  that they have once a year and here's another question the Pope has told us
[03:55:41.660 --> 03:55:45.100]  that air conditioning is evil that those of us in the West shouldn't have it does
[03:55:45.100 --> 03:55:48.620]  he feel that it's evil for those on Islamic pilgrimage to have it there
[03:55:48.620 --> 03:55:55.020]  what kind of efficiency do you think you get with a tent in the desert and air
[03:55:55.020 --> 03:56:01.020]  conditioner I mean the massive I can't even imagine the massive amount of power
[03:56:01.020 --> 03:56:05.940]  and that has to be used to try to cool a tent if you look at this picture there
[03:56:05.940 --> 03:56:10.700]  is absolutely no insulation on these things and it is out in the middle of
[03:56:10.700 --> 03:56:16.980]  the desert there but let's not worry about that let's simply criticize people
[03:56:16.980 --> 03:56:21.580]  for having air conditioning now as I pointed out in the last segment and we
[03:56:21.580 --> 03:56:25.260]  have the article from Paul Craig Roberts today all the Republican presidential
[03:56:25.260 --> 03:56:29.220]  candidates stand for war and of course one of the most militaristic is Carly
[03:56:29.220 --> 03:56:33.900]  Fiorina I would call her a Lindsey Graham in a skirt although that might be
[03:56:33.900 --> 03:56:38.620]  redundant I just haven't seen pictures of Lindsey in a skirt yet but of course she
[03:56:38.620 --> 03:56:43.180]  is the darling of the week with Fox News perhaps much longer than that and why is
[03:56:43.180 --> 03:56:47.580]  it well it's because Carly Fiorina not only promises to the military industrial
[03:56:47.580 --> 03:56:51.980]  complex anything that they want a blank check for them but her only government
[03:56:51.980 --> 03:56:56.060]  experience has been working with Michael Hayden with a CIA and how they can do
[03:56:56.060 --> 03:57:01.020]  dragnet surveillance of the American people and of course being at Hewlett
[03:57:01.020 --> 03:57:04.660]  Packard she had some experience with that because Hewlett Packard has set up
[03:57:04.660 --> 03:57:08.660]  the massive biometric tracking system that Israel has used to track
[03:57:08.660 --> 03:57:12.660]  Palestinians over there they pretty much have a lock inside the Israeli
[03:57:12.660 --> 03:57:16.860]  government the military industrial complex there but one of the things I
[03:57:16.860 --> 03:57:22.100]  think is interesting is how she has sold herself as the anti-pillary she says
[03:57:22.100 --> 03:57:26.980]  I'm going to take feminism off the table at the same time she wears it on her
[03:57:26.980 --> 03:57:31.420]  sleeve continuously and I think it's instructive to look back then when she
[03:57:31.420 --> 03:57:37.140]  ran for Senate as Barbara Boxer the lady that she ran against who beat her
[03:57:37.140 --> 03:57:42.540]  pointed out it was the best year for Republicans that they'd had in a very
[03:57:42.540 --> 03:57:47.140]  long time back in 2010 remember they took over the Congress Republicans were
[03:57:47.140 --> 03:57:51.180]  winning everywhere but Carly Fiorina did not win her race against the other
[03:57:51.180 --> 03:57:55.220]  woman she was saying she was going to be the antidote to that and that's
[03:57:55.220 --> 03:58:00.380]  precisely what we did not see she also said she was the most mean spirited
[03:58:00.380 --> 03:58:05.420]  candidate she had ever seen in her race and there was a commercial which I
[03:58:05.420 --> 03:58:11.340]  wanted to get to look it up on Google this 30 second commercial will educate
[03:58:11.340 --> 03:58:15.620]  you about Carly Fiorina's background once they started running that
[03:58:15.620 --> 03:58:20.980]  commercial she knows dived in the polls and she never recovered and I think it
[03:58:20.980 --> 03:58:26.380]  is a very fair and accurate commercial do your due diligence understand what's
[03:58:26.380 --> 03:58:29.780]  going on understand you're going to get your freedom back fighting at the local
[03:58:29.780 --> 03:58:32.300]  level none of these presidential candidates is going to give it to you
[03:58:32.300 --> 03:58:43.820]  that's it for today's broadcast join us for the nightly news tonight
