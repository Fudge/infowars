[11:05.960 --> 11:10.240]  deal we can't get a hold of our reporters right now I talked to them 30
[11:10.240 --> 11:16.760]  minutes ago they were gonna do a live feed and I'm told we now have them on

[11:20.320 --> 11:28.960]  we can't do Skype but the globalists are losing right now TPP is unraveling
[11:28.960 --> 11:37.520]  it's in deep trouble sure they'll try to pass it again we'll fight it again these
[11:37.520 --> 11:40.520]  are tectonic forces of good and evil throughout history folks people think
[11:40.520 --> 11:45.640]  we beat it nine times but they're back again oh they're gonna win no we have to
[11:45.640 --> 11:49.120]  want it more than they do it's like a four-quarter football game here and by
[11:49.120 --> 11:54.280]  the way we're in the fourth quarter tied the fourth quarter starting baby and for
[11:54.280 --> 12:03.000]  it's all the marbles everything forget the G7 summit Bilderberg is where the
[12:03.000 --> 12:10.000]  big guns go London Guardian on an independent big business set to lobby
[12:10.000 --> 12:13.920]  politicians on the future of the EU at Bilderberg group meeting they go on to
[12:13.920 --> 12:20.960]  basically say it's illegal all over the Spanish and the Dutch and the Greek and
[12:20.960 --> 12:25.600]  the Italian and the Austrian and the UK they're reporting on Bilderberg saying
[12:25.600 --> 12:33.640]  it's criminal here in the US zero coverage but info wars.com and
[12:33.640 --> 12:37.760]  prisonplanet.com and other quote alternative media that's bigger than
[12:37.760 --> 12:43.280]  most mainstream media set side-by-side against each outlet and drudge
[12:43.280 --> 12:46.720]  report.com helping get it out linking to our stories that's the only groups
[12:46.720 --> 12:49.960]  covering this because mainline conservatives got up for years and
[12:49.960 --> 12:54.800]  said this didn't exist because if you ever admit there's shadowy groups pulling
[12:54.800 --> 12:58.400]  the strings we'll stop focusing on the puppets and start focusing on the
[12:58.400 --> 13:04.280]  controllers and then there goes your new world order down the toilet down the you
[13:04.280 --> 13:13.720]  know water as we know all toilets lead to the White House forget the G7 summit
[13:13.720 --> 13:17.600]  they don't like this Bilderberg is where the big guns go you've already failed
[13:17.600 --> 13:21.840]  federal police in covering up the criminal meeting the specter meeting
[13:21.840 --> 13:29.360]  going on in your town and oh no we have to have the police blocking all the
[13:29.360 --> 13:35.960]  entrance roads the sub roads coming into the main road because we can't have the
[13:35.960 --> 13:40.000]  public seeing the black sedans and the diplomatic plated vehicles going to
[13:40.000 --> 13:47.600]  meet the secret I mean this is upside down planet this is upside down world
[13:47.600 --> 13:51.960]  here's what I wanted to ask the federal police and if you go to our article on
[13:51.960 --> 13:58.840]  info wars.com Kurt Nemo says voice your opposition I totally agree with him we
[13:58.840 --> 14:03.160]  have all the phone numbers up there especially if you live in Europe live in
[14:03.160 --> 14:09.160]  Austria in surrounding areas you've got to call them and say the world is
[14:09.160 --> 14:13.960]  watching what are you doing trampling free speech for war criminals like
[14:13.960 --> 14:23.040]  Henry Kissinger give us a break and we've got the state police number the
[14:23.040 --> 14:29.280]  federal police number the traffic information center the federal police
[14:29.280 --> 14:35.080]  number they're all there with the country codes everything call the public
[14:35.080 --> 14:39.440]  relations offices and say how dare you because now the story is going to be
[14:39.440 --> 14:48.680]  about the secret group of fat cats the secret group of fat cats meeting and then
[14:48.680 --> 14:52.200]  wanting to keep the peasants back six and a half miles and then when the
[14:52.200 --> 14:57.960]  peasants dare put up YouTube videos showing the checkpoints police with
[14:57.960 --> 15:04.280]  their eyes bugging out basically storm the hotel guaranteed trying to get our
[15:04.280 --> 15:10.560]  reporters kicked out of it and then once they've got them kicked out like we've
[15:10.560 --> 15:15.280]  seen before then they won't let them up the road within two miles of a hotel
[15:15.280 --> 15:19.520]  and they've told them you are not to go on any of the national park trails
[15:19.520 --> 15:23.780]  they're harassing people that are skiing people that are hiking this was
[15:23.780 --> 15:29.200]  going on a week and a half ago this was in Austrian papers in the middle of a
[15:29.200 --> 15:36.280]  tourist destination this is a tourist town a tourist region the Alps you're

[16:02.720 --> 16:07.760]  only making it explode right now do you watch what you're doing will now be in
[16:07.760 --> 16:12.920]  scores of newspapers and will only draw more interest and what was the only way
[16:12.920 --> 16:19.280]  we'd fail ladies and gentlemen the only way we fail is by not going and showing
[16:19.280 --> 16:22.640]  your tyranny because they always act like the criminal scum they are you're
[16:22.640 --> 16:30.000]  not allowed to look Hillary Clinton in the eyes on record at Bilderberg they
[16:30.000 --> 16:34.480]  treat everyone like total filth and their minions treat the people like filth
[16:34.480 --> 16:40.400]  this is what they think of you unbelievable let's go to Rob do and
[16:40.400 --> 16:45.600]  Josh Owens reporting from telephone because Skype is down right now tell us
[16:45.600 --> 16:50.240]  where you are in the surrounding area and a report on the police and what
[16:50.240 --> 16:55.040]  you're planning all right hey Alex this is Rob do reporting live from
[16:55.040 --> 17:00.080]  mason Austria just right next door to tell us it's a even smaller hamlet we
[17:00.080 --> 17:04.920]  have a second hotel here just in case we got this actually because it had better
[17:04.920 --> 17:09.960]  Wi-Fi and then all of a sudden the Wi-Fi is back to screwy very interesting but
[17:09.960 --> 17:13.760]  today we were down intel interviewing people asking them what they thought
[17:13.760 --> 17:18.160]  about Bilderberg most of the older people didn't want to talk to us a lot of the
[17:18.160 --> 17:20.480]  younger kids were interested in Bilderberg a lot of them didn't know what
[17:20.480 --> 17:26.040]  it was but during all that I got a call from the hotel manager at the Rumpen
[17:26.040 --> 17:29.160]  Hof where we're staying we have a cabin up there it's the one that's real close
[17:29.160 --> 17:32.920]  to Bilderberg right so where the Interholpen is and he called and he wanted
[17:32.920 --> 17:36.440]  to know if we could pay in full on Wednesday said yeah you know we have no
[17:36.440 --> 17:40.640]  problem you know paying up whatever and he goes well he goes also the police
[17:40.640 --> 17:44.240]  were here looking for you I said really I said we already talked to the police we
[17:44.240 --> 17:48.760]  showed him our passports you know he goes yeah these might have been I don't
[17:48.760 --> 17:51.720]  know if they were different or not but they were asking about YouTube videos
[17:51.720 --> 17:56.080]  and I'm kind of speaking in his broken dial like he was you know talking in a
[17:56.080 --> 18:00.200]  German accent with English and I said the YouTube video is okay that's
[18:00.200 --> 18:03.880]  interesting I said we're you know is it the same police that are in the parking
[18:03.880 --> 18:06.360]  lot because I'll just go up and talk to them when we come back up he goes no
[18:06.360 --> 18:11.440]  they came from a different area I think these are more like like your FBI or
[18:11.440 --> 18:16.440]  something so that tells me that it could be the Cobra special operators that are
[18:16.440 --> 18:21.600]  here there's at least 24 of them that we know of so this this is by the way we're
[18:21.600 --> 18:26.160]  joking these are like these are like special forces people that reside in a
[18:26.160 --> 18:31.680]  castle and they call themselves Cobra security you cannot make this up right
[18:31.680 --> 18:36.560]  and and maybe they saw our report of John bound did on cope it didn't like that
[18:36.560 --> 18:41.760]  or maybe they saw the report of showing the checkpoint and they don't like our
[18:41.760 --> 18:48.240]  free speech they can go straight to hell with all the other fascist scum that's
[18:48.240 --> 18:52.720]  how I feel the guy tried to call me out for videotaping the checkpoint and I
[18:52.720 --> 18:55.640]  said listen you're out here doing something you know you're out here
[18:55.640 --> 19:00.440]  supposedly for this event that doesn't start till Thursday and he goes or the
[19:00.440 --> 19:05.840]  police we you know we have to do this and he was tried to justify that their
[19:05.840 --> 19:10.720]  tyrannical existence what they were doing so I after after this interview I
[19:10.720 --> 19:14.400]  plan on going back down into tells I'm gonna go to the local police and contact
[19:14.400 --> 19:18.120]  them I'm just gonna go into the police station and say hey I heard you guys are

[24:24.520 --> 24:29.160]  am your host Alex Jones if you just tuned in our reporters are covering the
[24:29.160 --> 24:35.240]  globalist meeting the top globalist meeting but they kept secret for about
[24:35.240 --> 24:43.040]  40 years in the last 15 or so we've blown it wide open thanks to Jim Tucker and
[24:43.040 --> 24:48.080]  of course the listeners of this broadcast World Net Daily Drudge Report and
[24:48.080 --> 24:53.560]  many others now it's all over international press and the Austrian
[24:53.560 --> 25:00.880]  police are flipping out federal police are looking for our reporters they're
[25:00.880 --> 25:03.440]  not hiding they're just getting on record what happened before they go
[25:03.440 --> 25:08.600]  looking for them and the sky's the limit there's a tyrannical takeover
[25:08.600 --> 25:12.160]  taking place in the next segment I'll play the video of the checkpoint now
[25:12.160 --> 25:16.400]  that we have the connection with do and others then I have a special report by
[25:16.400 --> 25:21.080]  John Bowne on how TPP is in trouble and remember this is the group behind it all
[25:21.080 --> 25:27.280]  and the 150 members sit on all the other major boards and internationalist groups
[25:27.280 --> 25:32.880]  but this is the very center of the spider web this is just a continuation of
[25:32.880 --> 25:38.120]  the G7 Rob do other points you think are important to make they're about six
[25:38.120 --> 25:42.680]  seven miles away from Bilderberg and other points that Josh Owens thinks we
[25:42.680 --> 25:48.360]  should know well before anything happened this morning when we were leaving
[25:48.360 --> 25:52.920]  our hotel we got we were talking to another blogger who stand there at the
[25:52.920 --> 25:57.920]  hotel and he said they've actually made the security perimeter supposedly smaller
[25:57.920 --> 26:02.600]  so they said now we can walk up to the bus depot and I think that might be in
[26:02.600 --> 26:06.400]  part due to some of the videos we put up because I think somebody probably
[26:06.400 --> 26:11.200]  solved it and made a phone call said look you can't treat people like this so I
[26:11.200 --> 26:14.320]  think that was a pretty important development that happened overnight I
[26:14.320 --> 26:19.280]  don't look at the report I was just told that that in Austria impressed the
[26:19.280 --> 26:23.680]  government issued a an order or decree whatever they issued that said they're
[26:23.680 --> 26:29.280]  shrinking the security perimeter and it's not as big as it once was so as we're
[26:29.280 --> 26:33.400]  getting closer to the event the security perimeter is shrinking which I think is a
[26:33.400 --> 26:36.920]  good thing because this is you know taxpayer public security at this point
[26:36.920 --> 26:43.800]  plus the security perimeter that big won't work right exactly you keep yeah
[26:43.800 --> 26:48.200]  you cannot have that much security there's just no way to do it and with
[26:48.200 --> 26:52.000]  that many people and today they moved actually moved the checkpoint from down
[26:52.000 --> 26:57.040]  in tells up the mountain probably two miles so they actually moved the
[26:57.040 --> 27:01.040]  checkpoint up they started installing porta-potties there so that's going to be
[27:01.040 --> 27:07.040]  the new checkpoint and in the town of Mosin it's a very small town there's two
[27:07.040 --> 27:11.480]  hotels where we saw a bunch of police there so I think that's where they're
[27:11.480 --> 27:15.280]  staying which is right next to well right up the road from the second hotel
[27:15.280 --> 27:18.640]  that we have yeah you should go in there and have lunch you should go in there
[27:18.640 --> 27:25.360]  and have lunch robbie let me ask you this question let me ask you this question
[27:25.360 --> 27:33.160]  well I forgot what the question was just go ahead well I am not too concerned
[27:33.160 --> 27:36.720]  the fact that if they have a problem with me putting up YouTube videos I'll
[27:36.720 --> 27:40.360]  gladly go there and have a dialogue but I'm going to record it I'm going to let
[27:40.360 --> 27:44.400]  him know hey I'm recording this you know if you have a problem with reporters
[27:44.400 --> 27:47.200]  they just say you have a problem with reporters and we can get that on the
[27:47.200 --> 27:49.840]  record and then we can have more discourse because that's the problem
[27:49.840 --> 27:54.320]  Bilderberg is all based on secrecy so we got to stop having the secrecy continue
[27:54.320 --> 27:58.040]  to ebb out in through the society and culture that nobody can say anything
[27:58.040 --> 28:01.400]  about Bilderberg nobody can say anything about security nobody can say anything
[28:01.400 --> 28:05.280]  about anything we've got to sit here shut up and take it as he's at least come up
[28:05.280 --> 28:08.560]  here to this mountain retreat and bathe this town and put all these people
[28:08.560 --> 28:14.760]  essentially on lockdown it's just great and my question was you you went and
[28:14.760 --> 28:18.240]  talked to locals to see what they think about the situation you were saying the
[28:18.240 --> 28:21.440]  old people were scared I guess they've seen this before they know how to
[28:21.440 --> 28:28.720]  submit but the young people were just ignorant a lot of the young people a lot
[28:28.720 --> 28:31.640]  of their answer was I said look you have to put out a guess what is the
[28:31.640 --> 28:36.080]  Bilderberg group of music group no it's not a music group and then I would
[28:36.080 --> 28:38.840]  explain to them what Bilderberg is and I'm like do you think we should have
[28:38.840 --> 28:42.960]  secret meetings one guy actually said yes we should and then I had to talk to him
[28:42.960 --> 28:45.840]  a little bit more and then I said I'm gonna ask you again do you think we
[28:45.840 --> 28:49.080]  should have we should have these meetings in secret and we don't know what's
[28:49.080 --> 28:51.680]  going on he's like no that's bad he's with his two buddies didn't speak much
[28:51.680 --> 28:55.120]  English just listen you need to go back to your house look it up on the
[28:55.120 --> 28:57.520]  internet and start talking to your friends about it because that's the
[28:57.520 --> 29:00.960]  only way this is going to change this is only going to change when we start
[29:00.960 --> 29:05.400]  talking about secret elite meetings that we can't talk about that pressure
[29:05.400 --> 29:09.560]  invited to the head of the economist is invited to I mean there's all kind of
[29:09.560 --> 29:15.040]  Bloomberg is there okay but they're not going to talk about it Hillary Clinton's
[29:15.040 --> 29:21.680]  point Hillary Clinton's chief advisor is on the list and and look at this they
[29:21.680 --> 29:25.440]  can only operate in secret so they can tell the public none of these groups
[29:25.440 --> 29:29.120]  exist since they've told the public this forever they're desperate to keep the
[29:29.120 --> 29:33.840]  public from learning that I know actually these groups do exist Rob great
[29:33.840 --> 29:38.560]  job I want to come back and get Josh's take on what's happened the last 24
[29:38.560 --> 29:41.680]  hours then we're going to play the clip of the checkpoint then I'm gonna get the
[29:41.680 --> 29:46.400]  John Bounds report and then you guys are gonna go out and try to find the
[29:46.400 --> 29:53.040]  federal police on video we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones
[29:53.040 --> 29:57.040]  and the GCN radio network
[29:59.240 --> 30:04.880]  fresh off reports that their acting head resigned because of a 96% failure rate
[30:04.880 --> 30:11.040]  the TSA is in the news once again this time with a notice that 73 of its own
[30:11.040 --> 30:16.320]  employees were flagged for terrorism I guess the hiring managers skip the
[30:16.320 --> 30:22.040]  class on how to read people's minds now to be fair the agency may be confused
[30:22.040 --> 30:25.840]  on what a terrorist actually is when they're being ordered to give VIP
[30:25.840 --> 30:30.440]  treatment to the Muslim Brotherhood a known terrorist organization the
[30:30.440 --> 30:33.520]  terrorist distinction came after the group bombed an Egyptian police
[30:33.520 --> 30:38.120]  department also there have been numerous examples of TSA putting innocent
[30:38.120 --> 30:43.160]  people on watch list small children having the red flag of a terrorist
[30:43.160 --> 30:49.000]  because they simply share the same name of a known offender the agency is in
[30:49.000 --> 30:54.720]  need of long overdue reform if not outright abolishment you can find more

[35:47.760 --> 35:51.960]  domestic parents that's what Cobra would say that's what specter would say
[35:51.960 --> 36:13.600]  that's what Goldfinger would say because that's who those people are resistance

[39:19.960 --> 39:24.400]  dustbin of history excuse me let me settle down before these reports just
[39:24.400 --> 39:28.400]  police harassing our reporters police trying to intimidate free speech police
[39:28.400 --> 39:31.680]  trying to act like we're criminals and bad makes me want to throw up while a
[39:31.680 --> 39:37.280]  bunch of criminals known criminals meet in secret on taxpayer dime hoping we
[39:37.280 --> 39:41.320]  don't expose their their criminal operations we've already exposed them
[39:41.320 --> 39:45.720]  and we're not gonna stop and it's not just info wars we've already reached
[39:45.720 --> 39:52.040]  critical mass and everybody knows it it is my goal to face you it is my goal

[40:00.520 --> 40:05.520]  operate in packs like you we're individuals we value freedom above
[40:05.520 --> 40:09.520]  everything else we value justice above everything we value defense of the
[40:09.520 --> 40:21.160]  innocent about everything I detest you you hate us I hate you right back let's
[40:21.160 --> 40:24.960]  go to Josh Ellen's excuse me Josh go ahead give us your take Josh Ellen's
[40:24.960 --> 40:28.840]  reporter info wars calm there in Austria seeing the disgusting worship of
[40:28.840 --> 40:33.760]  tyranny the disgusting police just rolling out a simpering hateful red
[40:33.760 --> 40:38.160]  carpet against the locals just just just brooding over them sycophantically
[40:38.160 --> 40:43.600]  crouching down to lick the hands of the filthy fetted Bilderberg wart covered
[40:43.600 --> 40:49.560]  proboscis of Henry Kissinger vomiting delicious goodies into their mouths go
[40:49.560 --> 40:55.880]  ahead Josh Ellen's info wars calm surprisingly enough when I got up this
[40:55.880 --> 41:01.040]  morning to leave this hotel to go meet you at the cabin the police president
[41:01.040 --> 41:05.800]  has ramped up an insane amount when I pulled out of this hotel driving down
[41:05.800 --> 41:10.640]  the street there were 1516 that I could see because the roads are winding up on
[41:10.640 --> 41:17.920]  this mountain of police caravans vans completely packed full probably what
[41:17.920 --> 41:23.880]  would you say 20 20 policemen in each van behind me so I swerved over you can
[41:23.880 --> 41:30.880]  see the video on the Alex Jones channel I swerve over and pull the camera up and
[41:30.880 --> 41:37.360]  you can see them just passing by the car one after the other the ones I got on
[41:37.360 --> 41:42.840]  camera I think 1415 there were even more before that it's just unbelievable that
[41:42.840 --> 41:48.560]  there are this many police out here and it hasn't even started yet well when
[41:48.560 --> 41:52.560]  they violate free speech and protect these criminals from the light of
[41:52.560 --> 41:57.040]  exposure not from violence when they do this they transmute themselves from
[41:57.040 --> 42:03.520]  police into true agents of evil absolutely and you can see the
[42:03.520 --> 42:08.040]  citizens in Austria a lot of the people that we talked to today they do talk to
[42:08.040 --> 42:12.080]  today they had gone through checkpoints and they didn't really seem to mind it
[42:12.080 --> 42:15.680]  that much they didn't really seem to bother them that much they were aware of
[42:15.680 --> 42:18.880]  the checkpoints they weren't necessarily even aware of what was going on so I
[42:18.880 --> 42:23.200]  think that that means that this kind of stuff probably not this level of
[42:23.200 --> 42:26.760]  intensity but this kind of stuff probably happens frequently and we're
[42:26.760 --> 42:30.920]  gonna see it and we see it now yeah it's good since time of Hitler we do it we
[42:30.920 --> 42:38.240]  keep it since Hitler we like it because good Hitler good yeah it's gonna be
[42:38.240 --> 42:43.000]  interesting what the Cobra if it is Cobra has to say about whatever video we
[42:43.000 --> 42:48.880]  posted on YouTube oh my gosh does it like it Cobra does it like our free speech
[42:48.880 --> 42:56.840]  you know what they can do upper rope don't you Josh I think so well hey you
[42:56.840 --> 43:00.600]  guys seem very excited to do do already confronted this one out of control cop
[43:00.600 --> 43:06.920]  are you intimidated by them Josh I don't you're not acting like it no I'm not
[43:06.920 --> 43:11.680]  intimidated by them and I just I'm I'm actually I don't want to say I'm excited
[43:11.680 --> 43:16.800]  but I'm very interested to see what they have to say I why are they coming back
[43:16.800 --> 43:21.000]  to the cabin that that do a thing at that we're that we're based out of why are
[43:21.000 --> 43:25.360]  they coming back there to see our passports again and to talk to us about
[43:25.360 --> 43:29.680]  a YouTube video as if a YouTube video it's such a major threat to the masters
[43:29.680 --> 43:33.400]  that they're serving it doesn't make no sense well they think you're gonna roll
[43:33.400 --> 43:38.760]  over like a dog a whip dog on your back and begin you know it's just it's just
[43:38.760 --> 43:43.640]  crazy I mean it's just it shows how out of control government is we just lost
[43:43.640 --> 43:49.160]  her skype feed oh let's go to phone let's contrast that to the UK where the
[43:49.160 --> 43:55.040]  police we had over 3,000 people there it was a huge event international news no
[43:55.040 --> 44:01.560]  one was arrested one guy jumped the fence and was detained we exposed that the
[44:01.560 --> 44:04.760]  media had to admit yeah it's a bad thing the Bilderberg's happening probably
[44:04.760 --> 44:09.480]  illegal in the US the police leave us alone just no media covers it just
[44:09.480 --> 44:14.360]  showing how controlled things are here but in Austria it's worse than Third
[44:14.360 --> 44:18.080]  World police state Turkey where we covered it they're the police were like
[44:18.080 --> 44:26.680]  real apologetic but we are told not to let you they were just scared and then
[44:26.680 --> 44:30.120]  following us around filming us and taking photos but they look very
[44:30.120 --> 44:34.600]  embarrassed in Austria they just get off on it what is it like for you Josh to
[44:34.600 --> 44:40.240]  see the ecstasy that these guys have prancing around their uniforms well
[44:40.240 --> 44:43.600]  listeners can see in the video I posted last night of our confrontation at the
[44:43.600 --> 44:48.920]  checkpoint the one guy that's why I froze the still of him looking into the
[44:48.920 --> 44:54.480]  car he walked by the car and you can see this in the video he walked by the car
[44:54.480 --> 44:59.440]  leaned over looked in with just those dead eyes looked in and put his hand on
[44:59.440 --> 45:03.200]  his gun as if we were about to do something as if he was about to have to
[45:03.200 --> 45:07.240]  use his gun on us because we were sitting in the car being very polite at
[45:07.240 --> 45:13.000]  that and so he comes over to do and makes a smart comment and then he goes
[45:13.000 --> 45:17.480]  into a tirade basically making himself look like a complete moron acting like
[45:17.480 --> 45:23.320]  they are the saviors of people and he said something like we do not protect
[45:23.320 --> 45:27.880]  justice we we protect all year it's our job you know putting himself on such a
[45:27.880 --> 45:33.080]  high pedestal that it was it was laughable I'm up I mean the arrogance of these
[45:33.080 --> 45:38.360]  people can this guy even do a cover commander imitation no I mean that's
[45:38.360 --> 45:46.560]  the real test I think that's what will last when we go to the police
[45:46.560 --> 45:52.400]  oh all right Josh oh it's great job I so you're gonna go to the police station
[45:52.400 --> 45:55.760]  and I would just be filming openly and they say what are you doing just say
[45:55.760 --> 45:59.520]  well you got cameras right here you have checkpoints I mean is it your national
[45:59.520 --> 46:04.480]  symbol a camera or is it an ostrich or is it Arnold Schwarzenegger's you know
[46:04.480 --> 46:10.320]  rear end with all the steroid injection shot points I mean what is it is it
[46:10.320 --> 46:16.120]  Kurt Voltaim you know and then just point out hey they're looking for us here
[46:16.120 --> 46:21.920]  we are we're evil reporters we turn ourselves in we're so horrible obviously
[46:21.920 --> 46:25.200]  cash a lot of your equipment back at one hotel because if they really get nasty
[46:25.200 --> 46:29.480]  they may try to you know grab all your stuff and that Lord knows do what but
[46:29.480 --> 46:34.920]  just get ready and take a photo before you go in and tweak that out at real
[46:34.920 --> 46:39.360]  Alex Jones but Josh when are you planning to do that so we can maybe see

[46:55.500 --> 46:58.880]  is probably 10 miles from where we are right now all right is it a state police
[46:58.880 --> 47:06.960]  local police or federal I believe it local police well I know that there's a
[47:06.960 --> 47:11.520]  smorgasbord of a different police out there but maybe you should just go find
[47:11.520 --> 47:16.240]  the the I know some are fed summer state police are those checkpoints federal or
[47:16.240 --> 47:21.880]  state police checkpoints I believe they're state police well why don't you
[47:21.880 --> 47:28.600]  go find their lordships you could go find them there too and you know pull up
[47:28.600 --> 47:34.040]  get out what are you doing talking to us we are such gods you do not talk to me

[47:51.360 --> 47:55.800]  the day so that I can get to the actual checkpoint video that he's talking about
[47:55.800 --> 48:01.760]  if you're a radio listener in full wars comm has the video posted you also watch
[48:01.760 --> 48:06.000]  us restream it info wars comm forward slash show and send that link out the
[48:06.000 --> 48:13.920]  folks we're gonna post on the front page the live link video of this
[48:13.920 --> 48:18.640]  transmission so you can share that with friends and family as well but this is
[48:18.640 --> 48:23.200]  important and I get excited to start barking back at the globalist minions
[48:23.200 --> 48:27.520]  it this is a big deal this is the trampling of freedom this shows you
[48:27.520 --> 48:31.920]  Europe's fallen to tyranny it just shows the darkness growing all over the
[48:31.920 --> 48:36.240]  planet but the good news is their agendas are in trouble we're fighting back and
[48:36.240 --> 48:40.640]  we will gain ground we will gain steam we will defend free speech worldwide we
[48:40.640 --> 48:46.280]  will defend the press worldwide we will stop NSA spying we will turn the tide
[48:46.280 --> 48:49.480]  of tyranny we have to we don't have a choice it's gonna totally overtake us
[48:49.480 --> 48:54.840]  if we don't and we're here just tip of the spear trailblazing telling the truth
[48:54.840 --> 48:59.400]  making it safe to expose that ISIS his government run making it safe for others
[48:59.400 --> 49:02.640]  to attack the Federal Reserve politically making it safe taking the heat
[49:02.640 --> 49:06.200]  up front to expose our government was involved in 9-11 that's now mainstream
[49:06.200 --> 49:09.800]  news it's now mainstream news the government's running ISIS as I mentioned
[49:09.800 --> 49:14.680]  that's our job and this morning I don't normally you know get arrogant or on a
[49:14.680 --> 49:18.800]  power trip but but I was in the shower this morning just thinking and I and I
[49:18.800 --> 49:25.120]  just thank God and I leaned my head up against the the the the stone wall and I
[49:25.120 --> 49:29.720]  thought thank God I've been protected this long thank God we've been so effective
[49:29.720 --> 49:41.720]  thank God that all of my problems all of my foibles have been turned to good
[49:41.720 --> 49:46.960]  Lord works mysterious ways and we are just at such a legendary epic point
[49:46.960 --> 49:50.840]  humanity is within four wars right at the tip of the spear I mean it is just
[49:50.840 --> 50:01.320]  surreal it is surreal to know the enemies vulnerable and know they can be
[50:01.320 --> 50:05.320]  defeated that's why they're freaking out that's why they're they have police
[50:05.320 --> 50:10.640]  threatening people six miles away because they cannot be exposed it's game
[50:10.640 --> 50:17.520]  over we have approached the enemy's main layer I'll keep using the analogy
[50:17.520 --> 50:21.080]  because we're talking about Germania here but we're talking about the former
[50:21.080 --> 50:26.600]  Austrian Hungarian Empire here but I mean we're we're like right there in
[50:26.600 --> 50:32.280]  Berlin within a hundred yards of of Hitler's command base I mean that's the
[50:32.280 --> 50:37.840]  allegory I mean we've already if people realize the power we had the globalists
[50:37.840 --> 50:41.200]  have this con game where they ridicule it oh Bilderberg doesn't exist is it a
[50:41.200 --> 50:45.760]  burger what does it got cheese on it oh there's no secret groups setting up trade
[50:45.760 --> 50:51.360]  deals a trigger there's no death panels dude these crazy people it doesn't work
[50:51.360 --> 50:55.440]  anymore because what they're doing is so illegal so illegitimate so over the
[50:55.440 --> 51:02.200]  top that the minute it's forced to be admitted it's all over that's why they're
[51:02.200 --> 51:05.800]  racing to get a police state in place they think that's gonna protect them
[51:05.800 --> 51:11.640]  when it all comes out it's not gonna protect anything you'll be thrown into

[52:02.560 --> 52:06.840]  something you dreamed of having that if you ever had status you'd realize how
[52:06.840 --> 52:12.280]  it's a prison how it's nothing the only reason to have status and power is for
[52:12.280 --> 52:16.880]  service real service that's the only thing that empowers everything else
[52:16.880 --> 52:22.680]  brings you down let's go to this checkpoint footage as our reporters

[52:34.040 --> 52:38.480]  cover-up that's why they act so guilty because their bosses have told them
[52:38.480 --> 52:41.360]  whatever you do you keep the press out of there whatever you do you intimidate
[52:41.360 --> 52:45.680]  people and run them off and they're going sir it is not working they are not
[52:45.680 --> 52:48.840]  afraid this is in the newspaper what do we do

[52:53.040 --> 53:00.360]  to do because if I kiss that rear end they might let me join in one of their
[53:00.360 --> 53:06.280]  subgroups all the money order you know I mean this is how these people think it's

[53:31.840 --> 53:36.680]  that's why I get fired up because they are the enemy of everyone your children
[53:36.680 --> 53:42.320]  your family your prosperity your wealth your dignity your honor they are
[53:42.320 --> 53:46.880]  anathema let's go ahead and go to this clip I'll narrate the parts where there's
[53:46.880 --> 53:52.160]  no audio here it is video starts with them driving through the mountain road
[53:52.160 --> 53:59.000]  coming up to the checkpoint first there's a few police vehicles and they drive
[53:59.000 --> 54:03.560]  one up to the actual checkpoint it stopped the police scurry around they've
[54:03.560 --> 54:07.000]  got an evil reporter there's nothing worse notice our police have been trained
[54:07.000 --> 54:11.320]  reporters are bad as well even mainstream reporters can attack now because the
[54:11.320 --> 54:17.320]  enemy the globalists need to turn the police to their service and by doing
[54:17.320 --> 54:21.040]  this we expose that it's happening
[54:23.520 --> 54:26.840]  they've gone through two different subject points now they're being stopped
[54:26.840 --> 54:31.560]  at this portable buildings on the highway to search them
[54:31.560 --> 54:43.640]  they just get off on the fact that they think they're menacing people yeah for
[54:43.640 --> 54:50.240]  the place up here they told us to carry that with us our guys are polite they're
[54:50.240 --> 54:52.520]  nice
[54:54.760 --> 54:58.680]  loving to check the papers our police have been trained as well he says pull
[54:58.680 --> 55:10.480]  over there put over there over the side there make them wait 10 minutes and then
[55:10.480 --> 55:19.400]  here comes the lucky charms man mr. arrogant be pleased on the back side so
[55:19.400 --> 55:29.480]  she goes to search Josh gets out to go to help her up in it
[55:30.080 --> 55:35.720]  so all of this is gone on the guy comes over with his hand on his gun basically
[55:35.720 --> 55:42.920]  bugging his eyes out menacing them they just look so upset like it's so
[55:42.920 --> 55:48.840]  disgusting that people would dare want to know about things they would dare not
[55:48.840 --> 55:54.560]  want to just grovel at the feet of tyranny she's see they're disgusted by
[55:54.560 --> 55:56.960]  freedom
[55:59.040 --> 56:08.680]  into the edge bit there in this game very small I think it's very impolite to
[56:08.680 --> 56:13.400]  film persons without asking them I think it's okay in Austria we say this is
[56:13.400 --> 56:18.480]  impolite okay right yeah it's okay for you if I film you sure but it's a
[56:18.480 --> 56:26.200]  question of character I think okay so do that's bad character who gets out to
[56:26.200 --> 56:31.160]  go talk to him you know I think it's a question to character that you guys have
[56:31.160 --> 56:35.040]  all this setup and there's not even an event going on there's not even what
[56:35.040 --> 56:40.760]  there's not even an event going on right now the event is not for Thursdays but
[56:40.760 --> 56:44.880]  we are the police right so it's our job and we get paid from Texas for controlling
[56:44.880 --> 56:49.680]  I know not only if this doesn't win we control the whole year sure I mean don't
[56:49.680 --> 56:53.240]  you think don't you think people are don't you think people are concerned
[56:53.240 --> 56:57.400]  about that like how much taxes are they spending on this yes I also spend taxes
[56:57.400 --> 57:00.720]  on this but I can't decide it but this is supposedly a private meeting you know
[57:00.720 --> 57:06.360]  this isn't a meeting for play this isn't a g7 this is a lot different yes I mean
[57:06.360 --> 57:09.600]  they say it's a private meeting they don't allow press yeah sure but it's a
[57:09.600 --> 57:15.320]  private meeting yeah but there is danger on it and we don't just say people
[57:15.320 --> 57:19.200]  that are officials okay because if you have a party at your home and there
[57:19.200 --> 57:23.440]  comes a burglar it's also your private home sure and we save it right and we
[57:23.440 --> 57:30.080]  also save this they're gonna save us by working for the Bilderberg group to
[57:30.080 --> 57:34.040]  treat the press like garbage and put his hand on his gun and bug his eyes out but
[57:34.040 --> 57:40.600]  when he didn't intimidate the crew then he got mad and ran off and then he
[57:40.600 --> 57:44.840]  really backed down when Rob do got out was towering over him just being polite
[57:44.840 --> 57:51.960]  and in going man what's your problem it's normal to want to cover 150 world
[57:51.960 --> 57:57.080]  leaders meeting in secret what's sick is that the Western press has been so
[57:57.080 --> 58:01.360]  controlled they would attend it and say it didn't exist being brought into the
[58:01.360 --> 58:06.000]  criminal corrupt conspiracy I told you we sell out a survival shield nascent
[58:06.000 --> 58:11.160]  iodine x2 we have a small amount that's being made right now and then when
[58:11.160 --> 58:13.440]  that's gone I don't know what's gonna happen but we have the original
[58:13.440 --> 58:16.840]  survival shield that a lot of folks like it's not as strong and it's very clean

[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:55.800]  unraveling very exciting Intel and that ties into the hundreds of articles that
[01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:59.040]  go back over the last few years everything is rigged the biggest price
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:04.800]  fixing scandal ever Rolling Stone this is who Bilderberg is London Telegraph

[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:20.600]  billion five guilty of market rigging but nobody gets in criminal trouble and

[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:50.360]  acting like their totes but they should all be in jail like Bernie Madoff or

[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:30.080]  the numbers to the state police the federal police and others and I think
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:34.880]  folks should also something you can do is the day Bilderberg starts arriving in
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:38.920]  the second day you can just call the hotel and ask for people's rooms are
[01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:45.760]  asked for by name and one morning it was 6 a.m. my hotel phone rings I'm about

[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:07.240]  the line of him having like a two-minute conversation with David Rockefeller

[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:58.640]  counters the al-Qaeda ISIS Salafist army is really just made up a whole bunch of
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:04.240]  people but the word is it's actually folks inside the US military in NATO
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:07.720]  you've already heard some of those folks on air saying the whole thing's a
[01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:12.040]  criminal operation arm al-Qaeda that's now breaking big in the news again
[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:26.120]  devastating victory for freedom but now they have hacked army dot mill and other

[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:37.440]  describes as superpowers by having your entire body act as a biological

[01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:44.200]  com and that supply is running low and is in question that's why it's more

[01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:12.440]  the GCN radio network we've got a huge second hour lined up for you any time
[01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:19.160]  now our reporters Rob do and Josh Owens reporting from Austria at Bilderberg
[01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:24.840]  2015 maybe calling either by phone or video Skype as they go look for the
[01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:28.800]  federal police that have showed up their hotel when they were gone wanting to
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:31.600]  know about their YouTube videos and wanting to talk to them and we're
[01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:36.640]  basically upset they've gone through checkpoints you name it so look for that
[01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:42.840]  to happen X u.s. intelligence officials confirmed secret Pentagon report proves
[01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:47.680]  u.s. complicity in creation of ISIS that's from zero hedge according to
[01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:52.080]  newly declassified u.s. document the Pentagon foresaw the likely rise of the
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:55.920]  Islamic State that's something they released after it got leaked that
[01:08:55.920 --> 01:09:01.800]  they're running it oh we've got to take your rights because al-Qaeda might attack
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:10.160]  you when they're running it that's what ISIS is report Pfizer hid link between
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:14.640]  antidepressants and birth defects just like they hid the link to mass murder
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:21.000]  and suicide g7 summit president Assad could face exile in Russia and the West
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:26.400]  plan to tackle ISIS in Syria that's their excuse to occupy Syria after they
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:30.960]  take a sod out is to take out ISIS they put in charge then ISIS will be given
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:36.600]  part of Syria and part of Iraq as the original payoff plan that's why the
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:40.200]  military admits they're not allowed to bomb any real ISIS in vehicles they're
[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:46.320]  given once a week or so a brick building to bomb just to make it look like they're
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:51.720]  actually fighting them truly truly sick so they've gone from openly backing them
[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:57.440]  two years ago to randomly bombing a few buildings just for the news media I want
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:02.160]  to get to this report TPP the unraveling begins and then after that
[01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:11.760]  simply amazing parallel that Richard pointed out to me this morning we have
[01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:21.080]  these two New York inmates that have basically broken out over the weekend
[01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:24.240]  it's one of the top stories in the country oh it's so horrible that they've
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:28.840]  gotten out oh we're all in so much danger one of them killed a sheriff's
[01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:34.000]  deputy the other one beat somebody to death it's clearly an inside job search
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:41.800]  for killers clues after brazen New York prison escape well that ties into the
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:46.560]  tens of thousands per month of illegals being released thousands of them
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:54.720]  convicted of aggravated crimes including rape assault arson bank robbery I mean
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:11:00.400]  you again this is it where's all the freaking out about that again I'm not
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:04.280]  even against the illegals they're just people fleeing collapsing countries I
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:10.720]  get it I'm against how they get off without fines they get to drunk drive do
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:14.640]  everything else commit felonies remember the railway killer mainly prayed on
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:17.920]  Hispanics that's another thing is they mainly pray on Hispanics they get away
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:22.800]  with it and on the immigrant community that's usually what gangs do first
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:32.760]  generation the big point here is that the railway killer killed like was it
[01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:36.320]  more than 15 people or something he'd rape him and kill him and they could
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:40.880]  ever keep him in jail because he had a fake name he'd get put in jail released
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:45.040]  for other crimes he just went around crimes freeing everywhere and we're
[01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:51.840]  told just ignore it but oh my gosh oh my gosh we've got criminals two of them
[01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:57.640]  that escaped in New York everybody's dead it's all over run for the hills okay
[01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:04.520]  let's go ahead now and go to this report some good news TPP the unraveling
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:10.800]  unraveling begins TPP will hand huge corporations the power to change u.s. laws
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:15.400]  at will but more and more people prominent people are speaking out
[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:20.960]  against it leading the charge is senator ran paul here's John bounce report the
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:24.960]  trans-pacific partnership trade package is beginning to unravel with more
[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:29.000]  prominent voices slamming president obama and the republican leadership over
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.840]  the secretive deal that threatens to cost American jobs and hand big
[01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:36.800]  corporations new powers that would violate national sovereignty house
[01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:41.760]  majority whip representative steve scolese of Louisiana and rules committee
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:45.880]  chairman representative Pete sessions of Texas refused to reveal to Breitbart
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:49.600]  whether they had read the TPP agreement but still said they would support the
[01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:53.920]  trade promotion authority and allow president Barack Obama to fast-track the
[01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:59.480]  TPP lawmakers claim that TPA is separate from TPP and that they will review the
[01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:03.420]  final TPP agreement before it is considered by Congress however as
[01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:08.280]  Matthew Boyle explains this explanation doesn't wash a vote for the TPA is a
[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:13.400]  de facto green light for the TPP since there is essentially no way to halt a
[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:18.320]  trade deal once it has been fast-tracked Boyle writes since fast-track was
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:22.040]  created in the Richard Nixon administration not one trade deal that
[01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:27.360]  started on fast-track has been forwarded as such a vote for TPA is a vote for
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:32.520]  TPP since passing TPA will all but guarantee the successful passage of
[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:37.120]  TPP senator Marco Rubio senator Lindsey Graham and representative John Boehner
[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:42.560]  are also refusing to reveal if they visited the secret room to read the
[01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:47.440]  controversial TPP document although all three are set to vote for the TPA
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:52.560]  Daniel Horowitz senior editor of the conservative review writes it is
[01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:56.320]  unforgivable for the Republican majority to shirk its congressional duty and
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:14:00.240]  refuse to read the text of a bill that will give Obama unprecedented authority
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:04.560]  over our economy passing a bill in order to find out what's in it is what
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:08.840]  placed the Pelosi Congress in the ash heap of history it's not an auspicious
[01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:13.320]  path for ambitious politicians the Washington Post reports the push from
[01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:17.320]  the president included direct calls to lawmakers interviews with television
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:21.680]  stations in key states and plans to bring several Democrats aboard Air Force
[01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:25.920]  one with him meanwhile despite claims that climate change mandates would not
[01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:30.000]  be a part of TPP president Obama admitted during an NPR interview on
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:34.200]  Wednesday that this would indeed be the case by passing such mandates via the
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:38.800]  TPP Obama could sneak through draconian climate regulations under the radar
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:43.040]  knowing that they would almost certainly be rejected by Congress on their own
[01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:47.560]  this would satisfy calls by the likes of French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius
[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:51.680]  a Bilderberg member to enforce the new rules via global treaties to cut
[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:55.640]  Congress out of the equation Obama will attend summit in Paris in December to
[01:14:55.640 --> 01:15:00.200]  negotiate a climate agreement Howard Richmond writes Obama would not need to
[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:03.760]  get Congress to approve the unfair climate change treaty terms that he
[01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:08.480]  negotiates instead he could get the Commission set up by the Trans Pacific
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:12.520]  Partnership Agreement to add those terms to the Trans Pacific Partnership
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:16.880]  after that the investor-state dispute settlement provisions set up by that
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:21.280]  agreement could enforce Obama's terms through the threat of multi-billion
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:25.960]  dollar fines upon the US government physicians are rallying as they become
[01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:30.400]  increasingly concerned about the passage of TPP prescription drug costs could
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:35.200]  waylay the affordability of biologics and thousands of prescription drugs by
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:39.520]  drastically altering intellectual property protections under the TPP
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:43.200]  corporations could sue countries for restricting their products due to
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:47.360]  legislation brought to fruition by their own government policies the
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:51.680]  investor-state dispute settlement portion of the TPP gives the upper hand
[01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:55.680]  legislative bodies would only act as advisory boards to the ruling
[01:15:55.680 --> 01:16:00.400]  corporatic governments most recently the World Trade Organization tribunal
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:04.560]  ruled against the United States in a NAFTA suit brought by Canada and Mexico
[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:08.960]  that claim the US country of origin labeling law which requires foreign
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:14.000]  meat to be labeled as such is an unfair and illegal trade practice the WTO's
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:19.000]  May 18th ruling was the fourth time in three years that the global court had
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:24.040]  ruled against cool even though US courts had ruled that cool is legal faced with
[01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:28.640]  WTO penalties and threats of retaliation the US Congress is now
[01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:34.000]  considering repeal of cool and American consumers may soon lose the ability to
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:38.880]  discover if the meat at the grocery store or restaurant is US raised or from
[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:43.640]  Mexico Brazil or China critics of the TPP assert that the trade deal will cost
[01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:48.640]  American jobs and give huge corporations the power to change US
[01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:55.240]  laws John Baum for info wars.com and that's why Builderburg is important it is
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:17:00.000]  the progenitor of the grand daddy of all of this
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:05.280]  meanwhile they're pushing for borders to be open across the planet and we have
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:13.280]  Richard Matt and David sweat who escaped this weekend from a maximum
[01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:18.000]  security prison in New York you've got the governor running around
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:22.240]  grandstanding like it's the end of the world you've got checkpoints guys with
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:27.720]  machine guns running around looking for them saying look out public oh it's so
[01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:32.600]  dangerous and I mean I hope they catch the guys the point is hundreds of
[01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:40.480]  thousands of illegals are released every year tens of thousands with serious
[01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:43.720]  felonies many of which haven't even served time they just have the
[01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:50.520]  convictions in Mexico or the US break out get out or are released and then
[01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:55.360]  they're picked back up and are released again ice director struggles to explain
[01:17:55.360 --> 01:18:00.120]  release of thousands of criminal immigrants immigration and customs
[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:07.160]  enforcement directors Sarah Saladina is sold on you thank you for helping me
[01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:10.640]  guys struggle to explain the reasons behind the Obama administration's
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:15.240]  release of thousands of criminal immigrants when pressed by Lamar
[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:24.480]  Smith Republican of Texas in the fiscal year of 2014 ice released 30,558
[01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:33.840]  convicted criminal immigrants did you hear that 30,000 plus convicted of 79,059
[01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:39.240]  crimes allowing them to walk free in the US and folks we're talking about
[01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:49.120]  everything you can imagine but then two guys get out and it just shows how
[01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:55.440]  controlled the media is any US newspaper that reported on Bilderberg
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:19:01.280]  it's newsworthy it's pertinent drugs would link to it it'd be one of the top
[01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:05.840]  stories it would cause a national debate you'd win a Pulitzer Prize because
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:08.880]  you're the mainstream media if you did it you'd get a Pulitzer Prize not the
[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:12.680]  people that worked on it for 40 years and I think that's fair because you're
[01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:17.240]  the mainstream media and your God well not anymore but see they won't do it
[01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:22.880]  because they're controlled and they know it's a quote career killer to report on
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:26.880]  the real shadow government but it's already a career killer because the
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:30.480]  globalists are shutting down the old media they don't want any media and
[01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:34.760]  they're coming after the free independent press so why have you
[01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:39.440]  destroyed yourselves why won't you report on it once Bilderberg kicks off
[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:46.080]  officially on Thursday there'll be some cheeky snarky joke articles or if I
[01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:50.640]  talk about China getting caught selling babies in gold foil and make a joke hey I
[01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:54.920]  bet you're eating that inside Bilderberg they'll all run with that and say that I
[01:19:54.920 --> 01:20:01.120]  was serious and then make a joke out of so the phone rings and I pick it up and

[01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:23.960]  reporters from the Alps in Austria Bilderberg 2015 let me plow into other
[01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:31.400]  news right now this story is up on RT.com it's also mirrored at info wars
[01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:39.880]  dot com droning on forever Boeing patents UAV that could fly indefinitely
[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:45.760]  recharging in midair electricity powered drone would have a rechargeable
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:52.480]  tether cable that would connect to a power source so the drone would fly up
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:57.400]  lower its light cable down and then fly in circles basically while it's
[01:24:57.400 --> 01:25:02.920]  powering back up as drone technologies continues to advance Boeing has raised
[01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:08.680]  the bar even higher the aerospace giants has received a patent for a UAV that
[01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:16.600]  could fly forever recharging in midair via a tether attached to ground I saw
[01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:22.680]  Alexander Hague back in like 1992 when he had a TV show nationwide on cable
[01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:29.160]  where he had a company that was going to have blimps over every major city but at
[01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:32.680]  about a hundred thousand feet that had solar panels on the top that would then
[01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:37.360]  run telecommunications cell towers but also spy on people his word was
[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:41.560]  security and now of course they're launching those they launched them a
[01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:45.840]  long time ago but only in certain cities like DC New York
[01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:52.240]  Salt Lake City for some reason had one Dallas had one and I could play you the
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:57.800]  ABC newscast and a CBS one you go to YouTube and type in mystery UFO over
[01:25:57.800 --> 01:26:04.320]  Salt Lake and it's a giant blimp better than the Hindenburg looks like the
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:14.040]  Hindenburg and it's got propellers on it and it's a government blimp we even
[01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:22.320]  know the model and instead they told the public it was an alien they said is it
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:27.520]  aliens I mean that's how they treat the public so stupid it's a blimp hundred
[01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:31.640]  plus year old technology in fact the French had hot air balloons for 400
[01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:35.680]  years ago and the Italians they debate who invented the French the Italians
[01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:43.160]  probably Italians they've had hot air balloons for 400 plus years they've had
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:50.640]  well thousands if you count the Chinese launching lanterns but the hot air balloons
[01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:55.640]  to carry people for 400 years and we've had derogables for over a hundred and
[01:26:55.640 --> 01:27:06.680]  15 years or so are longer actually and the public thinks it's a flying saucer
[01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:11.720]  because they they couldn't be educated on surveillance blimps instead they
[01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:17.240]  think it's an alien I mean that's what's so frustrating about this and they've
[01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:24.760]  got conservative talk show host that will get up on television and the radio
[01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:29.280]  and attack this show and say there's no FEMA camps there's no COG there's no
[01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:33.880]  NSA now they've changed their tune since then but back when they were doing that
[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:38.040]  four or five years ago saying I was a liar I knew people that worked in their
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:42.680]  offices and they said no they know it's real we're giving them all the
[01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:48.600]  documents they just have been told to do this imagine knowing they've got FEMA
[01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:52.640]  camps knowing they're preparing for all this and then you get up there and you
[01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:57.160]  lie because you're scared of the government you ought to be scared of
[01:27:57.160 --> 01:28:01.600]  not saying something and not doing something by the way they found the ABC
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:12.200]  news piece out of Salt Lake it's a giant silver blimp with rudders and tail fins
[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:18.920]  that's a naval blimp I know that model you can look it up up there
[01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:24.400]  surveilling people and everybody thinks it's a UFO if I can we rewind that and
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:32.960]  play the audio thanks this is my frustration here go ahead and roll it
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:43.960]  thanks what's hovering over Salt Lake City is it a rocket a blimp a UFO a
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:48.960]  strange object seen in the skies has residents scratching their heads the
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:53.560]  craft floated overhead for several minutes before disappearing Salt Lake
[01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:57.320]  air traffic controllers said their radar didn't pick up anything and they have
[01:28:57.320 --> 01:29:02.480]  no knowledge that's because they were told to lie that's a shorter version of
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:05.800]  the report there's a whole bunch of them they go into saying no it must be
[01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:10.320]  aliens it must be flying saucers because they don't want to tell you the feds
[01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:15.080]  have a giant blimp up there with ground penetrating radar snoop systems I mean
[01:29:15.080 --> 01:29:20.760]  I told people 20 years ago about the FBI's sessions and the Department of
[01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:25.600]  Energy and the EPA they've all got them but I knew because in each Texas I knew
[01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:29.640]  folks that worked on them and they said oh yeah they're out looking for marijuana
[01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:33.760]  fields there they fly over the power plants to check to see if they're
[01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:37.720]  fudging their sensors that no toxic waste is coming out of the towers but
[01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:41.040]  we're told to tell people that they're not government we'll see all that was
[01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:45.960]  released last week you can hear it here 20 years ago or you can hear it you know
[01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:53.040]  now from the establishment we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones
[01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:57.080]  and the GCN radio network
[01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:04.600]  maybe I'm old-fashioned but back in my day a school field trip consisted of a
[01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:08.800]  sack lunch and a trip to the zoo but now they've upped the ante in places like
[01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:13.360]  Minneapolis where a private school is taking their kids to a sex shop that's
[01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:17.120]  right multiple news outlets are reporting that parents are demanding
[01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:21.120]  school chiefs removal after she took a group to the smitten kitten for sex
[01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:25.440]  education class and as you might imagine a place like the smitten kitten has
[01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:30.080]  several objects that you won't find in gym class and while the school has not
[01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:34.640]  been available for direct comment they did issue a statement Gaia Democratic
[01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:38.560]  Schools Board of Directors stands behind the premise of the field trip the
[01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:42.040]  statement said we view it as a legitimate learning experience that
[01:30:42.040 --> 01:30:45.880]  relates directly to the topics covered during our year-long sexual health
[01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:50.360]  class some parents like Steven straw Matt are mad as hell and have already
[01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:54.920]  removed their children from the school you can find more reports on the Alex

[01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:59.440]  pharmacological mammoth Pfizer faces more than a thousand lawsuits we're
[01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:07.440]  gonna hit that in a moment I want to get into the latest on Bilderberg and a
[01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:16.000]  whole other grouping of news about election 2016 here in this Republic but
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:22.160]  before we do that I wanted to just mention that Joe Biggs earlier was
[01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:28.200]  showing me magazine articles and newspaper articles out of Austria and
[01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:35.480]  then US stories about them concerning Cobra commandos no it's not a GI Joe show
[01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:41.400]  it's a real security group that is running security and I guess in charge
[01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:47.280]  of the 2000 federal and state police paid for by taxpayers to guard the
[01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:53.720]  Bilderberg group meeting the New York Times says does not exist you can pull
[01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:59.760]  up a article out of the New York Times it's a film review of the film New World
[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:05.960]  Order that came out in 2009 a year after Bilderberg 2008 in Chantilly Virginia
[01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:10.640]  and they actually say that I'm in a hotel parking lot having a full-on
[01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:16.200]  hallucination of blackstand secret service and world leaders that they
[01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:22.840]  just said that you see Jones imagining things that's right none of this is real
[01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:27.200]  the show isn't real Obamacare is not real nobody's coming after your guns
[01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:31.640]  nobody got rid of the borders nobody's jacking up your taxes government loves
[01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:39.560]  you government's perfect everything's fine so I asked Joe to get these articles
[01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:52.680]  together maybe scan them or give the files to the crew so that we can show
[01:35:52.680 --> 01:36:02.400]  TV viewers just how amazing this is that that Bilderberg has this paramilitary
[01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:07.240]  group running around protecting it from the evil press all again taxpayer paid
[01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:16.280]  for briefly before I get into Pfizer and how they hid the link between any
[01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:23.040]  depressants and birth defects and before I get back into the fact that everyone's
[01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:28.000]  freaking out the media is freaking out about two escaped killers from New York
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:37.520]  State prison the 30 plus thousand illegals that have been released that
[01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:45.040]  have felony criminal backgrounds we have some congressional testimony dealing
[01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:52.440]  with that and more but briefly we sold out of survival shield nation iodine
[01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:56.240]  X2 the deep earth crystal source it's so pure and that folks have you know had
[01:36:56.240 --> 01:37:00.160]  such rare reviews about because everybody knows there's a massive iodine
[01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:04.960]  deficiency out there in the soil and in the food that's why seafood is so
[01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:08.440]  important because it has a lot of iodine has a lot of toxins as well so the best
[01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:13.560]  place to get it is deep earth pure source well no one else we know of has
[01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:21.120]  ever done that we have the problem is we secured some two years ago and
[01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:24.960]  basically it's run out and now we're having to secure more and that may take
[01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:28.800]  some time so we're sold out right now we have a small amount of the iodine left
[01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:32.920]  the crystals that has been basically manufactured but now it's got to be put
[01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:36.520]  in the bottles and then shipped from the laboratory here in the US to our
[01:37:36.520 --> 01:37:40.040]  shipping facility but we're gonna be out for a while of survival shield nation
[01:37:40.040 --> 01:37:44.440]  iodine X2 we do have the original survival shield that's from a kelp source
[01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:50.880]  the cleanest out there after X2 super high quality but not as strong that's
[01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:58.160]  what I tend to give my children info wars life.com or 888-253-3139 and
[01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:03.400]  secondarily it's a win-win because your purchase supports the broadcast and what
[01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:13.720]  we're doing here when you buy these products it funds the whole operation

[01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:31.600]  and birth defects pharmaceutical mammoth Pfizer faces more than a thousand
[01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:38.200]  lawsuits from victims who say the company knew about the relationship between
[01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:41.840]  birth defects and their number one best-selling antidepressant a claim that
[01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:45.440]  Pfizer has of course battled against now however new reports of surface that
[01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:49.120]  Pfizer's own scientific advisors were warned of the deadly link for more than
[01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:55.840]  a year something that my team told you in 2012 was already going on this is
[01:41:55.840 --> 01:42:01.560]  Anthony Uchiarty reporting according to Bloomberg at Pfizer Inc. report shows a
[01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:05.640]  scientist warned executives last year about a potential link between the
[01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:11.280]  antidepressant drug Zoloft and birth defects I know someone who the doctor
[01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:17.960]  says got verligo or whatever Michael Jackson had from Zoloft and recommended
[01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:22.140]  changes to the medication safety warning again I kind of inserted that
[01:42:22.140 --> 01:42:25.080]  statement in the middle of that line let me just read that again a Pfizer Inc.
[01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:30.960]  report shows a scientist warned executives last year about a potential
[01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:36.960]  link between the antidepressant drug Zoloft and birth defects and recommended
[01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:41.120]  changes to the medication safety warning the document from a Pfizer drug
[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:46.000]  safety official might complicate the company's efforts to fend off lawsuits
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:49.000]  brought by parents of children with malformed hearts
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:53.400]  Pfizer has consistently rejected suggestions that Zoloft caused newborn
[01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:59.000]  abnormalities and Monday the document was taken out of context by lawyers
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:03.480]  suing the company here's what we know about serotonin reuptake inhibitors
[01:43:03.480 --> 01:43:11.240]  they're super toxic across the board they're based in fluoride molecule and
[01:43:11.240 --> 01:43:17.720]  they just have a laundry list of things they do to you they're extremely toxic
[01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:22.800]  they're extremely addictive they're extremely psychoactive they are in the
[01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:29.920]  whole of juice the hallucinogen class they are hallucinogenic they are
[01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:37.320]  psychotropic and they also are linked to Alzheimer's they're linked to diabetes I
[01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:45.360]  mean they're bad news and they push them on everybody there are more than 50
[01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:49.960]  different types of serotonin reuptake inhibitors just in the United States and
[01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:57.040]  they usually are stronger than the last one the average foster child in America
[01:43:57.040 --> 01:44:01.760]  70 plus percent are on psychotropic look it up or any psychotics they're on
[01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:07.680]  mind-altering drugs either either speed or any psychotics or antidepressants
[01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:15.360]  but 70 plus percent in national studies look it up are on a behavioral
[01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:24.480]  modification drug and on average they're on seven drugs total that are
[01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:27.520]  mind-bending because they start acting worse and worse the answer is more and
[01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:32.880]  more drugs you guys actually find the headline that was quick that one was
[01:44:32.880 --> 01:44:36.960]  saying it all Americans we're looking for foster okay yeah I just remember a
[01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:42.160]  W.O.A.I. report on the state numbers and they had state hearings in the state
[01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:45.320]  defended it and said well the fact we're putting 70 I think was like 70
[01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:52.280]  one percent of our kids on these drugs is okay because that's a national average
[01:44:52.280 --> 01:44:58.560]  as well in fact it was the headline was over two-thirds of Texas foster
[01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:05.160]  children on mind-altering prescriptions Congress asked why foster children take
[01:45:05.160 --> 01:45:12.880]  more mental health meds than other kids that's yahoo news 2014 the point is when
[01:45:12.880 --> 01:45:18.080]  you're in the government's grass they do horrible things by the way I'm not
[01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:22.360]  doing a cliffhanger here I don't really do that I have a tendency to say we have
[01:45:22.360 --> 01:45:27.080]  big news coming up and then just start saying it right then our reporters were
[01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:30.200]  only 10 miles away from the state police headquarters they were gonna go to and
[01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:33.320]  say here we are we hear the feds that are commanding you were looking for us
[01:45:33.320 --> 01:45:38.760]  we're just reporters we have nothing to hide they would already be there but the
[01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:44.920]  checkpoint has a huge traffic backup now and so they've been in traffic for
[01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:49.280]  almost an hour trying to get 10 miles in Austria there's the checkpoints they've
[01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:52.640]  set up all over the place so they're in traffic in a checkpoint they're unable
[01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:57.640]  to get Skype right now so you can't see that but they are shooting HD video so
[01:45:57.640 --> 01:46:01.480]  we can show the traffic jam there's the headline traffic jam caused by
[01:46:01.480 --> 01:46:08.240]  Bilderberg security traffic jam caused by secret government conspiracy I know I
[01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:12.080]  told you guys to do it but we've called them and told them to shoot video right
[01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:16.480]  of that traffic jam fantastic great job
[01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:23.000]  now I mentioned this earlier but I forgot to play the clip so I'm gonna do it
[01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:29.800]  now and it ties into this report Hillary's plan to stuff the ballot box by
[01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:35.200]  Phyllis Schlafly of World Net Daily she spotlights the devious plan to capture
[01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:38.680]  even more illegal alien votes and then she goes over Clinton now all these
[01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:41.640]  states are issuing the illegals driver's license then letting them vote
[01:46:41.640 --> 01:46:45.960]  Illinois and New York are saying let illegals vote openly so first they
[01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:49.080]  denied that was the plan now they're just I mean can I go to Mexico or
[01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:54.800]  Nigeria or China and show up and get free healthcare and have my baby and then
[01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:59.840]  vote no they'd laugh at me and they should of course you can't vote in China
[01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:04.560]  so I guess it's kind of a non-issue because it's so free it's the model of
[01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:07.640]  course all the trendies are into it
[01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:12.400]  they're also into quote killing their kids it's so sexy you think I'm if you're
[01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:15.600]  a new listener we actually have clips of communists saying I kill my kids I kill
[01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:20.280]  my kids I love killing my kids I love Satan I love long arm hair I love
[01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:26.400]  stinking I just I just love it that ties into ice director struggles to explain
[01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:32.480]  release of thousands of criminal migrants 79,000 crimes plus committed by
[01:47:32.480 --> 01:47:37.960]  30,000 released just last year we don't have numbers yet by the way I just
[01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:42.080]  released 30,000 more violent criminal illegal aliens onto American streets
[01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:51.400]  who mainly attack Hispanics I guess we want to collapse like Mexico we've got
[01:47:51.400 --> 01:47:55.320]  to get a handle on this right now folks it's out of control that ties in to
[01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:59.800]  congressional testimony earlier this year with families talking about losing
[01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:05.760]  their loved ones to criminal illegals who've been released when no one else
[01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:10.400]  would be be the Hispanic black or white or Asian of your citizen you get put in
[01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:14.560]  prison but if you're an illegal you are a magical creature who gets released over
[01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:20.720]  and over and over again let's go to that testimony my name is Jamil Shaw my son
[01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:27.320]  Jamil Andre Shaw II was murdered by a dreamer DACA recipient a child brought
[01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:32.160]  to this country by no fault of his own my family's peace and freedom were
[01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:37.600]  stolen by an illegal alien from Mexico he was brought here by his illegal alien
[01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:42.640]  parents and allowed to grow up as a wild animal some people believe that if you
[01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:48.280]  are brought over by no fault of your own that it makes you a good person they
[01:48:48.280 --> 01:48:53.120]  want us to believe that dream at kids don't murder I am here to debunk that
[01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:58.520]  myth kids brought over the border by no fault of their own do kill Americans
[01:48:58.520 --> 01:49:04.600]  how many Americans killed by illegal aliens are too many one two hundred
[01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:09.800]  thousand hundred thousand ask any parent whose child was murdered by an
[01:49:09.800 --> 01:49:14.840]  illegal alien how many is too many as one of those parents I'm here to tell
[01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:21.080]  you that one is too many my son Jamil Shaw II was murdered while walking on
[01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:26.800]  his own street three houses down from his home in a legal alien on his third
[01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:32.720]  gun charge was visiting a neighbor where my son was coming home he shot my son
[01:49:32.720 --> 01:49:37.680]  in the stomach and then in the head killing him do black lives really matter
[01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:42.960]  or does it matter only if you are shot by a white person or a white policeman
[01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:47.240]  the well yes that is the only time it matters because George Soros wants us
[01:49:47.240 --> 01:49:54.520]  all killing each other and again the gang culture whether it be white black
[01:49:54.520 --> 01:49:58.920]  or Hispanic is being protected and being fostered and being allowed to grow
[01:49:58.920 --> 01:50:04.760]  because if he reads a big number sense keys between the technotronic era they
[01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:08.760]  admit that governments like to have combines of criminals that run
[01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:15.440]  everything in certain racial areas so that they can basically control those
[01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:19.640]  populations through the criminals that actually work for them and just like it's
[01:50:19.640 --> 01:50:23.080]  come out that some of the biggest Mexican drug cartels work for the CIA and
[01:50:23.080 --> 01:50:31.440]  the DEA destabilizing Mexico just like ISIS works for our government this is
[01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:37.160]  the sick plan so they sell it like oh you just don't like Hispanics no I love
[01:50:37.160 --> 01:50:43.480]  everybody as long as they're not welfare-head criminals and what's
[01:50:43.480 --> 01:50:47.240]  happening is took the entire world China's now replaced Mexico is the
[01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:53.280]  biggest destination group coming here China runs ads Cheng moved America get

[01:53:12.760 --> 01:53:16.160]  realize there was such a thing as electronic pickpocketing what is that
[01:53:16.160 --> 01:53:20.120]  well apparently many of the new credit and debit cards being issued have radio
[01:53:20.120 --> 01:53:24.360]  chips inside them called RFID the transmitter banking information to
[01:53:24.360 --> 01:53:28.320]  card readers when we pay unfortunately a bad guy can also get one of these
[01:53:28.320 --> 01:53:31.840]  readers and go around the city scanning people collecting their credit card
[01:53:31.840 --> 01:53:36.120]  numbers and personal information without us knowing it wow that sounds scary
[01:53:36.120 --> 01:53:39.640]  since you're getting a new wallet anyway you should definitely get an ID

[01:54:14.400 --> 01:54:17.960]  covered it to our tweet asking him are you going to be attending Bilderberg
[01:54:17.960 --> 01:54:21.760]  because you're gonna be in Germany and Austria when it's going on and his chief
[01:54:21.760 --> 01:54:26.200]  of staff said no and the media made jokes about it and said how dare they

[01:58:57.280 --> 01:59:01.920]  because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality
[01:59:01.920 --> 01:59:06.640]  and they weren't as affordable as they should be so I refused probably 30 40
[01:59:06.640 --> 01:59:11.000]  firearms manufacturers over the years will then about six months ago we get
[01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:16.440]  contacted by head down firearms HD firearms.com own and run by a bunch of
[01:59:16.440 --> 01:59:20.320]  former Navy SEALs special ops people their veterans their patriots their

[01:59:50.720 --> 01:59:56.120]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:59:56.120 --> 02:00:12.120]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:12.120 --> 02:00:16.240]  he all right we're cutting straight to our last few on the GCN radio show
[02:00:16.240 --> 02:00:21.040]  here back live live video feed audio feed from the state police headquarters in
[02:00:21.040 --> 02:00:24.880]  the area Rob do's has been thrown out tell us what happened during the break
[02:00:24.880 --> 02:00:27.120]  Rob I couldn't skip that break was in the hour
[02:00:27.120 --> 02:00:32.920]  sure well you probably saw what the the large guy came out they seem to have a
[02:00:32.920 --> 02:00:37.200]  size differential whenever the large guys come out there's always a bit of
[02:00:37.200 --> 02:00:42.640]  air air and angst about them but he came out and said you're Rob do yes we we
[02:00:42.640 --> 02:00:48.160]  told you not to film the police and and then he said something else and then
[02:00:48.160 --> 02:00:50.720]  left so I guess maybe that's what they're gonna tell me not to film the
[02:00:50.720 --> 02:00:55.760]  checkpoints anymore which that seemed to be the message that they wanted to give
[02:00:55.760 --> 02:01:00.280]  me they never said don't film the checkpoints all the guy said was that's
[02:01:00.280 --> 02:01:04.440]  rude to do to film checkpoints or to film the police that when they had
[02:01:04.440 --> 02:01:08.640]  cameras yeah you tried to ask him what the law is what did he say to that he
[02:01:08.640 --> 02:01:12.000]  didn't answer me he walked off and then the other guy got all snippy he goes
[02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:16.000]  there's no discussion during the break he said there's no discussion we have the
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:20.400]  whole thing on video Josh shot it as well I was also recording audio and we
[02:01:20.400 --> 02:01:24.560]  had a hidden pin camera so I guess we've given them all our intelligence at
[02:01:24.560 --> 02:01:29.400]  this point we're not hiding you told him you were filming yeah I told him we
[02:01:29.400 --> 02:01:34.400]  were filming I told him we were broadcasting live and you know all I
[02:01:34.400 --> 02:01:41.720]  could say is they have a very pretty receptionist well you're married Josh
[02:01:41.720 --> 02:01:46.720]  has got a girlfriend that's right what happens in Austria stays in Austria no
[02:01:46.720 --> 02:01:52.800]  no no no he did look receptive like you wanted to get a picker up so no it was
[02:01:52.800 --> 02:01:58.520]  uh it's just very this is just a very weird police state there's not a lot of
[02:01:58.520 --> 02:02:02.600]  you know communication from them I have no problem with not filming their
[02:02:02.600 --> 02:02:06.280]  checkpoints they never said that oh give me a break their checkpoints on a
[02:02:06.280 --> 02:02:11.080]  highway they got the cameras all aimed at us I mean look like you've done
[02:02:11.080 --> 02:02:14.680]  something wrong wait no here's the thing Alex when we went there through the
[02:02:14.680 --> 02:02:18.120]  first checkpoint the first time we didn't even have our cameras going and
[02:02:18.120 --> 02:02:22.600]  they flipped out they were flipping out on us they had their hands on their guns
[02:02:22.600 --> 02:02:26.640]  like we were doing something bad because we showed them us passports we showed
[02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:41.440]  them us passports the next time we're going through the checkpoint we're
[02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:44.960]  gonna film it and they got all mad that the second time went to the checkpoint
[02:02:44.960 --> 02:02:48.920]  we filmed it and then they tried to tell me I was rude for filming them you know
[02:02:48.920 --> 02:02:53.120]  and I'm like look I'm not trying to be rude the point is they keep turning it
[02:02:53.120 --> 02:02:58.840]  around this is what they do they make it like you're a criminal so you didn't
[02:02:58.840 --> 02:03:03.720]  defend yourself changing the subject to them having checkpoints trying to act
[02:03:03.720 --> 02:03:07.440]  like the press is illegal covering a very important event I would say to them
[02:03:07.440 --> 02:03:12.720]  next is filming illegal in Austria tell me the law we are press why are you
[02:03:12.720 --> 02:03:17.400]  covering up the criminal meeting because as soon as we did that in
[02:03:17.400 --> 02:03:21.280]  Switzerland they stopped acting aggressive we said go back and check with
[02:03:21.280 --> 02:03:25.320]  your Canton leaders state leaders you're gonna get a lot of trouble and then
[02:03:25.320 --> 02:03:30.360]  next they were very polite and helpful after those exchanges so I would just
[02:03:30.360 --> 02:03:34.160]  say hey we're not criminals we're here to cover this you let us in the country
[02:03:34.160 --> 02:03:37.680]  you ought to be glad we're covering it don't you want to know what's going on
[02:03:37.680 --> 02:03:41.240]  because I guarantee you those people don't know anything they're in there
[02:03:41.240 --> 02:03:47.560]  talking about sports scores all day right and taking selfies we're actually
[02:03:47.560 --> 02:03:51.760]  going back up to the other checkpoint so I don't know how much longer is the
[02:03:51.760 --> 02:03:57.320]  show going we've got an hour left so how far away from that checkpoint are you
[02:03:57.320 --> 02:04:01.600]  I would say about six minutes okay we'll just get a little bit of traffic
[02:04:01.600 --> 02:04:04.640]  getting down here but after that we're you know it's it's smooth sailing we'll
[02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:10.760]  do this down at seven yeah pull over take a break I'm gonna come in talk to
[02:04:10.760 --> 02:04:14.000]  for about five minutes about Bilderberg and some interesting developments with
[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:19.840]  Joe Beggs but be on Skype with us okay and then and then with Joe Beggs and
[02:04:19.840 --> 02:04:24.600]  here with us you can then go live up to the checkpoint and when they come and
[02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:31.280]  say I already told you no filming you say tell me the law I want to know the
[02:04:31.280 --> 02:04:37.240]  law tell me why do you have cameras I guarantee they've got cameras at the
[02:04:37.240 --> 02:04:41.320]  checkpoint and so just talk to them because believe me they don't want to
[02:04:41.320 --> 02:04:46.760]  escalate this they'd love to arrest you and get brownie points with their
[02:04:46.760 --> 02:04:50.800]  masters but they've been told don't do that because it'll draw more attention
[02:04:50.800 --> 02:04:54.760]  and then the press will be forced to report on the criminal mafia meeting
[02:04:54.760 --> 02:04:58.480]  mafia 2.0 taking place Rob you just stay on the line but we're gonna come right
[02:04:58.480 --> 02:05:04.600]  back to you checkpoints harassment and cobra commandos this is not your
[02:05:04.600 --> 02:05:10.800]  granddaddy smoke-filled room this is Bilderberg 2015 every year the
[02:05:10.800 --> 02:05:16.320]  Bilderberg confab tweaks its efforts to lock out the media deny transparency and
[02:05:16.320 --> 02:05:22.840]  keep its agenda secret similar to the 6.2 mile exclusion zone around the radio
[02:05:22.840 --> 02:05:27.480]  active chair noble plant Austrian federal police have set up a similar size
[02:05:27.480 --> 02:05:33.200]  zone to keep the public away from the hotel or over 150 world leaders will
[02:05:33.200 --> 02:05:39.000]  meet in secret info wars reporters were stopped at a checkpoint had their
[02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:43.760]  vehicle searched and even had police come to the front door of their hotel
[02:05:43.760 --> 02:05:49.640]  room all in the name of keeping their cameras away from the 150 world leaders
[02:05:49.640 --> 02:05:54.960]  attempting to meet in secret will have continual coverage of Bilderberg on the
[02:05:54.960 --> 02:06:00.120]  Alex Jones channel on YouTube ladies and gentlemen you haven't really ever
[02:06:00.120 --> 02:06:04.080]  heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show or the
[02:06:04.080 --> 02:06:08.280]  nightly news or the news website info wars.com because the companies I've
[02:06:08.280 --> 02:06:12.840]  been approached by were not the highest quality and they weren't as affordable
[02:06:12.840 --> 02:06:17.720]  as they should be so I refused probably 30-40 firearms manufacturers over the

[02:10:05.840 --> 02:10:09.000]  world I mean our stickers are all over the world but but I mean there you go
[02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:15.280]  really I want to know it's it's it's the dot in the eye on the inter open so I
[02:10:15.280 --> 02:10:18.920]  just wanted to we were tapping to be driving by that spot again we saw that
[02:10:18.920 --> 02:10:23.240]  as we pulled in today or yesterday I took a picture was it yesterday yeah it was
[02:10:23.240 --> 02:10:28.600]  yesterday I guess I took a photo of it and tweeted that out I'm going to tweet it
[02:10:28.600 --> 02:10:32.280]  tell folks where you are what's about to happen some stations don't care that
[02:10:32.280 --> 02:10:35.760]  first five minutes you were thrown out of the police station they said you rob
[02:10:35.760 --> 02:10:41.720]  do you not film police yeah we've already told you that and then I know
[02:10:41.720 --> 02:10:45.360]  whatever said you can't film the police no one ever said that that's the funny
[02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:48.680]  thing it's like they're acting like this is old news and they never said to me
[02:10:48.680 --> 02:10:54.120]  don't film the police they came to your hotel to tell you that yeah they came to
[02:10:54.120 --> 02:10:58.680]  my hotel and that's you know really that's what you came to my hotel for
[02:10:58.680 --> 02:11:03.600]  don't put up YouTube videos of police I mean what do you have to hide we
[02:11:03.600 --> 02:11:06.720]  obviously that's what they're worried about us we obviously have something to
[02:11:06.720 --> 02:11:10.560]  hide you know they freaked out we drove now this is we're gonna drive past this
[02:11:10.560 --> 02:11:15.960]  is where the checkpoint was yesterday they have since moved it by the way the
[02:11:15.960 --> 02:11:21.320]  TPP is in trouble there the EU's in trouble their whole operation as we
[02:11:21.320 --> 02:11:26.280]  expose it's in trouble they wanted us to all be covert please continue yeah so
[02:11:26.280 --> 02:11:30.320]  here's where they the checkpoint was yesterday this is now it's all clear
[02:11:30.320 --> 02:11:35.680]  suddenly you know and and from what we heard this this happened because people
[02:11:35.680 --> 02:11:39.800]  I guess people were complaining so they made the security area smaller because
[02:11:39.800 --> 02:11:43.080]  this is where they had us yesterday this is where we pulled off and there's a
[02:11:43.080 --> 02:11:47.480]  giant thing it says we're filming you there's a giant camera sign right
[02:11:47.480 --> 02:11:51.200]  there it says we're filming you and so they got but they got mad when I was
[02:11:51.200 --> 02:11:55.240]  filming and called me rude they're roving check well when they say that
[02:11:55.240 --> 02:11:58.280]  it's bad character to film say well you're filming down the street you're
[02:11:58.280 --> 02:12:04.680]  filming here right and I don't know if we're gonna start losing signal we're
[02:12:04.680 --> 02:12:08.880]  going out of the out of the the town area and going up the mountain and it's
[02:12:08.880 --> 02:12:14.040]  notoriously spotty service up here as we've been finding out from from our
[02:12:14.040 --> 02:12:19.480]  different trying to we see now the best reception down in side tell so yeah
[02:12:19.480 --> 02:12:24.440]  side view this is looking down the mountain right now and you do roving
[02:12:24.440 --> 02:12:28.520]  checkpoints beautiful area there's going to be a suspected attack or
[02:12:28.520 --> 02:12:31.600]  something like that so they can keep people thinking so that's what I'm
[02:12:31.600 --> 02:12:34.560]  saying it's kind of shady they've got these Cobra guys in there and they're
[02:12:34.560 --> 02:12:37.840]  moving their checkpoints around we're gonna get your military perspective in a
[02:12:37.840 --> 02:12:40.760]  moment on that you've dug up some interesting stuff out of the Austrian
[02:12:40.760 --> 02:12:47.840]  and Western press on Caldera but before we get into Caldera I'm gonna stay with
[02:12:47.840 --> 02:12:51.560]  these guys until they hit the checkpoint or until their feed goes out amazing
[02:12:51.560 --> 02:12:54.960]  view of your radio listener looks like there are thousands of feet up on the
[02:12:54.960 --> 02:13:00.320]  mountain it's frozen with the town down below them I tell you this has got to be
[02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:04.520]  though even though it's stressful guys a good place to be reporting from very
[02:13:04.520 --> 02:13:13.240]  very beautiful I expect to see snow white any moment pop out any other
[02:13:13.240 --> 02:13:18.600]  comments Rob do or Josh Owens it's very comfortable if you can hear me now it's
[02:13:18.600 --> 02:13:22.760]  very comfortable in terms of temperature it's nice and cool but it's not super
[02:13:22.760 --> 02:13:26.120]  humid even though it's been raining it rained yesterday it rained today but it
[02:13:26.120 --> 02:13:32.480]  doesn't feel really really human but like you get normally in Austin Texas it's
[02:13:32.480 --> 02:13:36.360]  a it's a different a different kind of temperature up here in the mountains it
[02:13:36.360 --> 02:13:39.640]  just feels like you're
[02:13:41.200 --> 02:13:46.440]  and anything we're going we're losing their feed right now you're listening to
[02:13:46.440 --> 02:13:50.800]  Bilderberg 2015 coverage that US media will not cover it's all over the farm
[02:13:50.800 --> 02:13:55.080]  pressure here's the checkpoint here we go
[02:13:57.160 --> 02:14:01.840]  yeah here we go coming through here so we're gonna find out what's going on here
[02:14:01.840 --> 02:14:09.040]  and let your skype stabilize stabilize your rear deflectors watch for enemy
[02:14:09.040 --> 02:14:17.080]  fighters yeah bring up that you're filming up front to just tell them you
[02:14:17.080 --> 02:14:19.960]  know is this a free country or not
[02:14:22.360 --> 02:14:29.200]  first then we're saying yeah inter hop in not not interop I'm broadcasting live
[02:14:29.200 --> 02:14:37.000]  on Skype the U.S. United States America just letting you know they have a
[02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:42.400]  picture of Josh and my passports they're actually looking at us right now
[02:14:50.400 --> 02:14:57.120]  can you imagine America's gonna be just one of the soldiers is telling them
[02:14:57.120 --> 02:15:03.120]  everyone the officers I'm sorry is they're having them pull over for
[02:15:03.120 --> 02:15:12.880]  further interrogation these are the ones that keep filming why aren't they
[02:15:12.880 --> 02:15:21.720]  scared we're going to be breaking all this down and some developments with
[02:15:21.720 --> 02:15:28.080]  Cobra the private military security force in camera well they had a picture of
[02:15:28.080 --> 02:15:31.400]  your license plate so they were obviously filming they had your they have my
[02:15:31.400 --> 02:15:36.440]  passport yeah but they said it's very impolite and so bad bad bad behavior I'm
[02:15:36.440 --> 02:15:41.080]  gonna put this back on me that you film them Rob
[02:15:42.720 --> 02:15:50.520]  Rob you've been directed over to the side of the road correct I don't believe
[02:15:50.520 --> 02:15:55.800]  they're getting my feed we're getting intermediate feed from them yep Skype
[02:15:55.800 --> 02:16:00.120]  just disconnected let's try to reconnect with them Joe Biggs watching this
[02:16:00.120 --> 02:16:03.680]  you've been over in Germany and Austria when you're in the military what do you
[02:16:03.680 --> 02:16:08.640]  make of their behavior it's pretty intense the thing that that makes me
[02:16:08.640 --> 02:16:11.440]  worry a bit is the fact that like you said earlier you're making this analogy
[02:16:11.440 --> 02:16:15.520]  comparing Cobra to FBI and I found some documents pretty much states right here
[02:16:15.520 --> 02:16:21.760]  that they are a mixture of much like America's FBI hostage team and are they
[02:16:21.760 --> 02:16:28.120]  private or are they federal because US media and other media just simply said
[02:16:28.120 --> 02:16:31.800]  they were private security they're federal yeah they are a federal group and
[02:16:31.800 --> 02:16:34.600]  then you were reading out of a German newspaper where they admit that they're
[02:16:34.600 --> 02:16:38.120]  at a castle where they used to torture people yeah it's called the show not
[02:16:38.120 --> 02:16:43.440]  castle and it's a document cam on that guys it's around Vienna it's a 19 mile
[02:16:43.440 --> 02:16:48.480]  south of the ancient Austrian capital it's a 60 room castle with a surrounded
[02:16:48.480 --> 02:16:54.680]  by 70 acre wooded park and surrounded by 15 foot high wall in that area and a lot
[02:16:54.680 --> 02:17:00.120]  of people said it's a center for spies and brainwashing so this is an area where
[02:17:00.120 --> 02:17:03.880]  they are mainstream newspaper saying torture brainwashing you name it from
[02:17:03.880 --> 02:17:07.640]  back in 1972 so you've got this document over that's where they're based now yeah
[02:17:07.640 --> 02:17:11.920]  and that's the the castle that they when I was able to do some and so now it's a
[02:17:11.920 --> 02:17:16.160]  shadowy federal group that they claim is also this private security I guess
[02:17:16.160 --> 02:17:18.560]  that's their argument because they're for Bilderberg but really it's the
[02:17:18.560 --> 02:17:23.120]  government doing it and then it's linked back to a torture castle yeah so I
[02:17:23.120 --> 02:17:26.800]  guess Cobra is probably named after these guys they're not naming themselves
[02:17:26.800 --> 02:17:32.400]  after Cobra yeah I guess we found the real Cobra yeah Cobra Cobra currency
[02:17:32.400 --> 02:17:39.160]  will defeat the press how dare you try to film our operations I've brought
[02:17:39.160 --> 02:17:45.280]  world leaders here to pledge allegiance to Cobra the Americans will soon go
[02:17:45.280 --> 02:17:53.840]  under TPP control sorry we have Rob do on the phone now Rob do go ahead yes
[02:17:53.840 --> 02:17:58.840]  right now they're searching through the car this is a full court press we haven't
[02:17:58.840 --> 02:18:06.480]  been searched like this before so this is I guess this is what it's like in a
[02:18:06.480 --> 02:18:11.200]  free country ask them say is Austria free or did it go back under the Soviet
[02:18:11.200 --> 02:18:16.160]  Union when we weren't looking I think I think they can hear you know I have you
[02:18:16.160 --> 02:18:20.520]  on speakerphone attention from the United States the world is seeing you
[02:18:20.520 --> 02:18:25.120]  engage in police state activities and violating the right of the press your
[02:18:25.120 --> 02:18:29.440]  harassment is being duly noted you're violating the Geneva Convention and your
[02:18:29.440 --> 02:18:33.960]  own federal and state laws guarding the criminal Bilderberg group from the light
[02:18:33.960 --> 02:18:38.120]  of day we know you've been harassing our reporters and trying to violate their
[02:18:38.120 --> 02:18:43.000]  right to gather information so I'm here as Alex Jones communicating with you to
[02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:46.640]  simply let us engage in the First Amendment you know who we are you know
[02:18:46.640 --> 02:18:50.040]  we don't have criminal records you know we simply gather information as
[02:18:50.040 --> 02:18:54.120]  legitimate press so I would ask you to simply stop harassing our reporters
[02:18:54.120 --> 02:19:03.920]  that are trying to do their job why do you do host us we do not host you we
[02:19:03.920 --> 02:19:10.840]  love you from America lots of love bling bling bling

[02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:23.480]  nodding in approval I think there's a crazy gobble of it alright he wouldn't
[02:19:23.480 --> 02:19:29.400]  be too far off anyways do what else is going on now right now they're going
[02:19:29.400 --> 02:19:34.040]  through our stuff I'm still sitting in the car I haven't popped out yet they
[02:19:34.040 --> 02:19:45.120]  haven't asked me to get out and Josh is disclosing our location for them we're
[02:19:45.120 --> 02:19:48.720]  being all up front I've got to skip this network break folks just support us
[02:19:48.720 --> 02:19:52.760]  them for our store.com gcmlive.com because we lose a lot of money when we
[02:19:52.760 --> 02:19:55.600]  skip these breaks but gotta do it with our reporters they're live on the ground
[02:19:55.600 --> 02:20:00.920]  Rob do tell us what else is happening so Josh is explaining to him right now
[02:20:00.920 --> 02:20:09.160]  where we're staying we have fully they pulled us over we pulled the car up
[02:20:09.160 --> 02:20:16.680]  they were looking in the trunk where I don't know I think I think journalists
[02:20:16.680 --> 02:20:23.720]  journalism I don't know is journalism illegal he's not answering me tell him
[02:20:23.720 --> 02:20:33.440]  that we want to be his Liebling and his Liebschen I think I know what that means
[02:20:34.040 --> 02:20:38.040]  yeah I'm trying to just be nice to give these guys a benefit of the doubt look
[02:20:38.040 --> 02:20:42.120]  we're just pressed there to cover an international conference it's not illegal
[02:20:42.120 --> 02:20:46.160]  the world is seeing this is a police state you've already come to our hotel
[02:20:46.160 --> 02:20:50.120]  we came to talk to you but notice they don't talk to us they just continue to
[02:20:50.120 --> 02:20:53.480]  act like it's dirty and it's bad to cover the press tell them to look up
[02:20:53.480 --> 02:20:59.440]  Canada and the firestorm that got started when they arrested me power unless
[02:20:59.440 --> 02:21:02.480]  unless they're done let's see if there you can try it well no they're gonna
[02:21:02.480 --> 02:21:07.160]  probably send somebody else over to talk to you know y'all had I don't know who
[02:21:07.160 --> 02:21:10.560]  came to our hotel today they're looking for me we went down the police station
[02:21:10.560 --> 02:21:16.520]  okay and anyway we're on live via cell phone now it's not video or anything but
[02:21:16.520 --> 02:21:21.360]  they were so basically we're just we went down the police station talked to
[02:21:21.360 --> 02:21:26.600]  them and now we're here and I don't know we're not trying to mess with anybody
[02:21:26.600 --> 02:21:30.240]  we just don't want to be messed with doing our job that's that's kind of how
[02:21:30.240 --> 02:21:34.560]  we feel thank you okay all right y'all have a good day
[02:21:34.560 --> 02:21:38.860]  he said thank you and tell them hell Cobra
[02:21:38.860 --> 02:21:40.860]  they've got
[02:21:40.860 --> 02:21:45.860]  I'm not gonna say hell Cobra
[02:21:45.860 --> 02:21:55.680]  these guys seem to be I don't know how the communication is they did have
[02:21:55.680 --> 02:22:03.480]  photo card did they give you our passports back yeah I think we need our
[02:22:03.480 --> 02:22:09.160]  passport and the booking no no no here they are they're back here okay here
[02:22:09.160 --> 02:22:12.080]  we're good we're good okay I just want to make sure they gave us our passports
[02:22:12.080 --> 02:22:16.800]  and our this booking paper this is probably the most important printout
[02:22:16.800 --> 02:22:20.160]  I've ever printed out out of all the printouts I've done it info or this
[02:22:20.160 --> 02:22:27.160]  booking paper has saved our bus many a time just by showing that we're staying
[02:22:27.160 --> 02:22:31.760]  up the hill they allow us to continue well that is the big let's just stop
[02:22:31.760 --> 02:22:35.520]  right there they would love to stop you but they know it'll make a major
[02:22:35.520 --> 02:22:39.360]  incident but let's just stop right there and think about where we are in
[02:22:39.360 --> 02:22:44.400]  America and in the world there's a globalist meeting of 150 people meeting
[02:22:44.400 --> 02:22:48.720]  it's already in the British news that it's totalitarian that it's illegal it's
[02:22:48.720 --> 02:22:52.720]  in the German news saying it's very suspect and they've got checkpoints
[02:22:52.720 --> 02:22:58.240]  miles and miles away from a private hotel checking everybody three days
[02:22:58.240 --> 02:23:01.720]  before it officially kicks off we're now two and a half days they've had these
[02:23:01.720 --> 02:23:07.840]  checkpoints for over a week and a half the press reports in Austria this shows
[02:23:07.840 --> 02:23:12.640]  the totalitarianism that this group's trying to put out worldwide and they're
[02:23:12.640 --> 02:23:17.520]  on record they're the ones behind victim disarmament they're the ones behind
[02:23:17.520 --> 02:23:22.400]  open borders they're the ones behind carbon taxes they're the ones behind it
[02:23:22.400 --> 02:23:26.920]  all and and I want you guys to now continue on to your hotel continue
[02:23:26.920 --> 02:23:30.560]  driving on cell phone I want to have you co-host with us here from Austria Rob
[02:23:30.560 --> 02:23:36.760]  do and Josh Owens but first you guys have anything else to add well I just want
[02:23:36.760 --> 02:23:41.520]  to say where they have the second new checkpoint now this is still a through
[02:23:41.520 --> 02:23:45.360]  road this is not the only road going to the hotel they they have a spot that they
[02:23:45.360 --> 02:23:50.320]  could block off that is another three miles up the road here that would that
[02:23:50.320 --> 02:23:53.240]  wouldn't bother anybody it wouldn't get anybody's business it wouldn't they
[02:23:53.240 --> 02:23:56.760]  wouldn't be searching people and they would still have plenty of room to set
[02:23:56.760 --> 02:24:01.120]  up a security perimeter it's not like but why do they even set it up for a
[02:24:01.120 --> 02:24:04.840]  private group that's not important according to our media there you go
[02:24:04.840 --> 02:24:09.720]  yeah why don't they just have security at the hotel and in its front gate it's
[02:24:09.720 --> 02:24:14.920]  about harassing everyone so we can't even aim cameras at the building mm-hmm
[02:24:14.920 --> 02:24:20.400]  yeah we can't even get to the media can say it doesn't exist exactly so they can
[02:24:20.400 --> 02:24:25.080]  play the public like a bunch of idiots we've gone to do talk to two different
[02:24:25.080 --> 02:24:29.320]  police groups the one downtown they're very rude to us and then the ones up
[02:24:29.320 --> 02:24:33.480]  here who I guess just rifled through our stuff Josh what did they actually look
[02:24:33.480 --> 02:24:36.920]  through they just look they open up the trunk at everything right they opened up
[02:24:36.920 --> 02:24:42.360]  the trunk they pulled up the lining of the car and looked underneath the lining
[02:24:42.360 --> 02:24:47.320]  of the car so we're very dangerous at this point this is the most full body
[02:24:47.320 --> 02:24:50.640]  cavity search we've ever had to undergo place in the back for a tire and they
[02:24:50.640 --> 02:24:55.760]  ripped up the lining under yeah all right guys we have Paul Watson on the line
[02:24:55.760 --> 02:24:59.360]  with an update on what's happening and unfolding then we're gonna give you some
[02:24:59.360 --> 02:25:02.160]  breaking news on Cobra I'm gonna big article out on it
[02:25:02.160 --> 02:25:05.840]  Bilderberg claimed it was private security no it's it's German secret
[02:25:05.840 --> 02:25:11.120]  police or Austrian secret police involved in mind control this is mainstream
[02:25:11.120 --> 02:25:17.320]  news you in a castle predating GI Joe villain Cobra so this is probably who
[02:25:17.320 --> 02:25:21.760]  Cobra is named after we thought it was a joke they were called Cobra again truth
[02:25:21.760 --> 02:25:27.440]  is stranger than fiction usually it turns out stuff in in fiction is from
[02:25:27.440 --> 02:25:32.960]  reality let's get Paul Watson's take who's still in the UK in London you'll
[02:25:32.960 --> 02:25:39.560]  be traveling in tomorrow into Austria Watson what do you make of this
[02:25:39.560 --> 02:25:44.360]  boys I mean that the claim that it's illegal to film police in Austria from
[02:25:44.360 --> 02:25:48.520]  what I've read is complete BS I mean there'd been some pretty high profile
[02:25:48.520 --> 02:25:53.200]  cases involving asylum seekers and illegal aliens where it was legal to
[02:25:53.200 --> 02:25:58.040]  film police so there's no law against it there's something where they can claim
[02:25:58.040 --> 02:26:02.280]  copyright against their image later on but there's no it's not an actual crime
[02:26:02.280 --> 02:26:05.280]  to film the police in Austria so they only claim the copyright if you're
[02:26:05.280 --> 02:26:09.280]  selling something off their image like like branding it with them the under
[02:26:09.280 --> 02:26:13.280]  news gathering I looked it up to before you guys went they they can say
[02:26:13.280 --> 02:26:19.600]  nothing no so you know there's gonna be dozens more people filming them there in
[02:26:19.600 --> 02:26:23.680]  a couple of days anyway and that's you know last year in Denmark it was
[02:26:23.680 --> 02:26:28.280]  completely different of course and that hotel was almost in the city center it
[02:26:28.280 --> 02:26:32.720]  was literally you know like a mile away from the city center they the police
[02:26:32.720 --> 02:26:36.520]  met with us before we could set up right outside the hotel literally large
[02:26:36.520 --> 02:26:41.480]  yards from the hotel as all the cars were driving in completely different the
[02:26:41.480 --> 02:26:47.520]  police arrested provocateurs that were harassing us they were pretty nice yeah
[02:26:47.520 --> 02:26:51.480]  the provocateurs were worse than the police but in Switzerland it was a
[02:26:51.480 --> 02:26:56.160]  similar geography you know the hotel was halfway up a mountain but still we
[02:26:56.160 --> 02:27:00.560]  could literally stand a hundred yards away from the hotel and look directly at
[02:27:00.560 --> 02:27:04.640]  it there was a huge staging area there so the fact that they show the black
[02:27:04.640 --> 02:27:08.080]  helicopters landing and taking off everything yeah that roll some of the
[02:27:08.080 --> 02:27:12.320]  black helicopters guys go ahead so the fact that they've they've set up these
[02:27:12.320 --> 02:27:18.080]  check point six miles away is bizarre because you know maybe it's due to the
[02:27:18.080 --> 02:27:21.360]  fact that they weren't happy with us last year because literally they were
[02:27:21.360 --> 02:27:26.160]  sat out on the patio having lunch in Copenhagen and there was just a like a
[02:27:26.160 --> 02:27:30.800]  chain-link fence separating the windows like eight guys are basically
[02:27:30.800 --> 02:27:36.400]  fondling each other in bathrobes yeah they were doing that in the in the
[02:27:36.400 --> 02:27:40.760]  hotel window it was all very public and even though we were literally you know
[02:27:40.760 --> 02:27:44.680]  a less than a stone's throw away from Bilderberg members they were about four
[02:27:44.680 --> 02:27:49.600]  cops in the whole area so in comparison to this where they've got you know
[02:27:49.600 --> 02:27:55.320]  2,000 police surrounding this compound it's completely ridiculous because there
[02:27:55.320 --> 02:28:00.440]  are just thought of something Google the leader of Cobra security Austria that's
[02:28:00.440 --> 02:28:08.080]  Cobra commander I bet he's even wearing a mask I'm sorry Paul go ahead well it's
[02:28:08.080 --> 02:28:12.960]  just total overkill Cobra was created as a reaction to the terrorist attack on
[02:28:12.960 --> 02:28:17.680]  the Munich Olympics so they're treating you know a few of the way was staged by
[02:28:17.680 --> 02:28:23.160]  the Germans even at the end of the one day in September or whatever the name it
[02:28:23.160 --> 02:28:27.960]  it won an Academy Award it's got a Michael Douglas narrates it at the end
[02:28:27.960 --> 02:28:31.640]  they admit that they actually staged the hijacking of the plane to release the
[02:28:31.640 --> 02:28:36.160]  terrorist because they'd actually work for the government the whole time sorry
[02:28:36.160 --> 02:28:41.440]  go ahead yeah so it's it's complete overkill I mean there weren't even that
[02:28:41.440 --> 02:28:44.920]  many protesters in Copenhagen it was in the middle of the city so there's
[02:28:44.920 --> 02:28:49.720]  probably gonna be what a few dozen bloggers and quote protesters who can't
[02:28:49.720 --> 02:28:55.440]  even get anywhere near the place when it kicks off so a complete overkill 5.6
[02:28:55.440 --> 02:29:02.560]  million euros including the G7 for this joint operation taxpayer funded that
[02:29:02.560 --> 02:29:07.240]  can't be justified completely ridiculous but again Bilderberg claims that
[02:29:07.240 --> 02:29:13.000]  it's a charity and in fact the UK gave it charity status even though it's a
[02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:16.400]  bunch of private individual let me ask you this Paul and we're gonna break
[02:29:16.400 --> 02:29:20.040]  come back with everybody here Joe Biggs yourself Paul Watson and the crew there
[02:29:20.040 --> 02:29:23.960]  on the ground I want to ask you what you're gonna be trying to focus on when
[02:29:23.960 --> 02:29:26.760]  you get there what you expect to happen I also want to ask you why do you think
[02:29:26.760 --> 02:29:32.000]  England had 3,000 plus people at once demonstrating against it but the US or
[02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:35.000]  anywhere else you can't get that I mean that says something about the UK folks
[02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:41.040]  that they're more awake I think oh yeah I mean that's it that's it yeah I mean
[02:29:41.040 --> 02:29:45.560]  you get what a few hundred when it's in Chantilly but nowhere near like it was
[02:29:45.560 --> 02:29:48.400]  in Watford I want to ask you that question when we come back stay there
[02:29:48.400 --> 02:30:04.240]  on the March the Empire is on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network fresh off reports that their acting head resigned because of a 96%
[02:30:04.240 --> 02:30:10.680]  failure rate the TSA is in the news once again this time with a notice that 73 of
[02:30:10.680 --> 02:30:15.920]  its own employees were flagged for terrorism I guess the hiring managers
[02:30:15.920 --> 02:30:21.440]  skip the class on how to read people's minds now to be fair the agency may be
[02:30:21.440 --> 02:30:25.840]  confused on what a terrorist actually is when they're being ordered to give VIP
[02:30:25.840 --> 02:30:30.440]  treatment to the Muslim Brotherhood a known terrorist organization the
[02:30:30.440 --> 02:30:33.560]  terrorist distinction came after the group bombed an Egyptian police
[02:30:33.560 --> 02:30:38.480]  apartment also there have been numerous examples of TSA putting innocent people
[02:30:38.480 --> 02:30:44.000]  on watch list small children having the red flag of a terrorist because they
[02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:49.800]  simply share the same name of a known offender the agency is in need of long
[02:30:49.800 --> 02:30:55.200]  overdue reform if not outright abolishment you can find more reports

[02:34:30.920 --> 02:34:35.640]  who we are they we're not criminals we work with Alex Jones info wars they
[02:34:35.640 --> 02:34:40.640]  already have all that they already know me welcome you are up to out no filming
[02:34:40.640 --> 02:34:44.360]  but Joe Biggs wants to get into some of the military angle before I go back to
[02:34:44.360 --> 02:34:49.240]  Paul and you guys dealing with this cover group to the media earlier said oh
[02:34:49.240 --> 02:34:53.040]  private security they're not private it's the it's the ministry of the
[02:34:53.040 --> 02:34:57.920]  interior and it's made out of the anti-terror unit from the Munich games
[02:34:57.920 --> 02:35:04.160]  back in the 70s by 1978 well if you watch one day of September the one in
[02:35:04.160 --> 02:35:07.960]  Academy Award they admit at the end of the movie that it was a false flag and
[02:35:07.960 --> 02:35:15.160]  that they staged a hijacking to release the supposed bombers I mean just
[02:35:15.160 --> 02:35:19.280]  every this is the group that ran false flag of the attack on the Munich
[02:35:19.280 --> 02:35:23.960]  Olympics there is no end to this that they're certainly connected then you
[02:35:23.960 --> 02:35:27.200]  pull up a mainstream newspaper article you folks the headline of Joe Biggs
[02:35:27.200 --> 02:35:31.960]  that says it's connected to mind control in a castle that in the country side
[02:35:31.960 --> 02:35:37.040]  outside Vienna at their command base this is from January 30th of 1972
[02:35:37.040 --> 02:35:42.000]  Chodnall Castle is a mystery to Viennese like it said it is this giant
[02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:48.240]  six-room castle on a 70-acre wooded park with 15 foot high walls and that
[02:35:48.240 --> 02:35:52.400]  people said that this was a center for spies and brainwashing and that's the
[02:35:52.400 --> 02:36:00.560]  Boca Raton news so so this thing is news in Florida yeah and then you've got the
[02:36:00.560 --> 02:36:04.640]  Cobra commander group that we're still kind of find out who the commander of
[02:36:04.640 --> 02:36:07.440]  it is the leader of the ministry the interior is a woman and that's why he
[02:36:07.440 --> 02:36:11.920]  wears a mask she's on screen there's Cobra commander actually she's asking
[02:36:11.920 --> 02:36:15.440]  the commander of the units but she's the overall commander that's why Cobra
[02:36:15.440 --> 02:36:19.000]  commander usually wears a mask because she knows that people don't really want
[02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:22.760]  to follow a woman in combat that's why he speaks to that voice like that because
[02:36:22.760 --> 02:36:27.160]  it's really a woman there you go there's Cobra commander sorry so yeah these
[02:36:27.160 --> 02:36:31.200]  guys are much like our FBI and what is our what is our FBI done before stage
[02:36:31.200 --> 02:36:36.480]  events plant evidence to arrest people and that's one of my biggest fears for
[02:36:36.480 --> 02:36:40.560]  some of these guys you know the reporters over there right now that when
[02:36:40.560 --> 02:36:43.160]  they leave their hotel rooms I would encourage you guys when you go back
[02:36:43.160 --> 02:36:47.200]  every time to search that place to make sure nothing's being planted because of
[02:36:47.200 --> 02:36:50.880]  the reason they're being so hostile towards you and stopping you nonstop and
[02:36:50.880 --> 02:36:53.920]  you know and and just being rude I wouldn't make sure that you would be
[02:36:53.920 --> 02:36:57.520]  checking those rooms every time you go back so they don't plan something so
[02:36:57.520 --> 02:37:01.000]  they can come in and all of a sudden say oh we need to come in and perform a
[02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:03.960]  search and then they've got something there that they can kind of get you with
[02:37:03.960 --> 02:37:11.040]  I think that's a great point we're going back to Paul Watson in a moment but let's get
[02:37:11.040 --> 02:37:16.960]  a comment from Rob do and Josh Owens well I'm actually checking every orifice
[02:37:16.960 --> 02:37:21.680]  in the kitchen right now to make sure there's nothing hidden because yeah I
[02:37:21.680 --> 02:37:26.200]  am taking that advice to heart you need to check Henry Kissinger's orifice for
[02:37:26.200 --> 02:37:31.480]  the Constitution maybe where it's hidden I think when when they come up upon me
[02:37:31.480 --> 02:37:38.720]  next time I'll try this oh wait put your weapon I mean you know harm
[02:37:38.720 --> 02:37:43.360]  put your hands maybe they'll maybe that'll like lighten the mood because
[02:37:43.360 --> 02:37:48.640]  these guys are so serious like I'm wearing a blazer you know I'm wearing a
[02:37:48.640 --> 02:37:54.840]  blazer I have a ball cap on I'm wearing glasses you know I'm not I'm not carrying
[02:37:54.840 --> 02:37:59.680]  any weapons you know I have I have a camera I have several cameras and that
[02:37:59.680 --> 02:38:03.400]  that's it that's all we're armed with is the truth and that's all we can do and
[02:38:03.400 --> 02:38:07.800]  it's just amazing you know having that that little confrontation with the cop
[02:38:07.800 --> 02:38:12.520]  yesterday who was trying to justify what they were doing and then saying we do
[02:38:12.520 --> 02:38:16.560]  this for you if you have a party and there's a break-in no you don't set up a
[02:38:16.560 --> 02:38:21.680]  five-mile checkpoint in front of my party and have 2,000 cops running around my
[02:38:21.680 --> 02:38:25.520]  property if I'm having a party for an organization the New York Times and
[02:38:25.520 --> 02:38:29.600]  Rush Limbaugh says doesn't exist that sounds like a McKinney pool party can I
[02:38:29.600 --> 02:38:35.120]  hear from Yoda one more time about because I interrupted Yoda earlier oh wait
[02:38:35.120 --> 02:38:41.240]  what's your weapon I mean you know harm that's really good
[02:38:41.240 --> 02:38:50.360]  nothing to see here at all hello mr. penguin hello mr. penguin oh my
[02:38:50.360 --> 02:38:54.680]  goodness well the thing is they're working for the terrorist everyone knows
[02:38:54.680 --> 02:38:59.560]  it they have to act like we're bad and why they swat team Amish people in
[02:38:59.560 --> 02:39:02.960]  two-year investigations over them selling a neighbor cheese because it's not
[02:39:02.960 --> 02:39:07.960]  illegal but they have to show the jury look we swat team them like it's it's
[02:39:07.960 --> 02:39:11.160]  all theater sorry go ahead well it's amazing how they say they're gonna be a
[02:39:11.160 --> 02:39:16.160]  private security group meanwhile right here it says Austrian Austrian federal
[02:39:16.160 --> 02:39:22.480]  police and what magazine is that out of this was from a magazine let me see this
[02:39:22.480 --> 02:39:29.000]  one it's called Cobra Austria special police commandos a law and order so it's
[02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:33.880]  a law enforcement magazine here here law and order mag calm let's look at it and
[02:39:33.880 --> 02:39:37.080]  they don't even have real photos of themselves it's like artist renderings
[02:39:37.080 --> 02:39:43.600]  of them doing heroic deeds and again folks it's not just covering
[02:39:43.600 --> 02:39:48.680]  Bilderberg this is how the media operates it's how the police operate these
[02:39:48.680 --> 02:39:54.800]  are microcosms of the larger world sorry go ahead you know I was just saying
[02:39:54.800 --> 02:39:58.920]  they they pride themselves on their mountaineering skills the Cobra guys
[02:39:58.920 --> 02:40:01.640]  they're they always compete in these mountaineering competitions and they
[02:40:01.640 --> 02:40:06.160]  always place in the top two or three I you know these are the elite of the elite
[02:40:06.160 --> 02:40:11.000]  of you know of these special forces and it just makes me wonder why they need to
[02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:14.720]  be here for you know like you said an event that doesn't exist and I was at
[02:40:14.720 --> 02:40:19.000]  least 24 of them here yeah I was looking at the map to and there's a an area
[02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:23.600]  where forks and goes into a single road that goes up into the hotel they could
[02:40:23.600 --> 02:40:28.200]  easily just block off that one area that entrance and then allow traffic to
[02:40:28.200 --> 02:40:31.960]  move freely throughout that area meanwhile you're six miles back and a
[02:40:31.960 --> 02:40:35.520]  complete and total police say going through God knows how many checkpoints
[02:40:35.520 --> 02:40:37.600]  today I mean how many checkpoints have you had to go through the day this will
[02:40:37.600 --> 02:40:42.880]  only draw more attention on it I mean that's what's gonna happen here to right
[02:40:42.880 --> 02:40:47.160]  and and everybody I taught well not everybody I talked to probably four out
[02:40:47.160 --> 02:40:51.520]  of the five people that I talked to down there in the town we talked about 20
[02:40:51.520 --> 02:40:53.960]  people but probably four or five of them said yeah they had to go through a
[02:40:53.960 --> 02:40:56.760]  checkpoint and they thought it was weird one guy's like yeah we had to go through
[02:40:56.760 --> 02:40:59.960]  them three times we're just going up to the lake to hang out and we got into a
[02:40:59.960 --> 02:41:03.480]  checkpoint every time then they're being citizens they just have to flash an
[02:41:03.480 --> 02:41:06.760]  ID and go through but they still have to wait if they're pulling somebody else
[02:41:06.760 --> 02:41:10.480]  over we saw a group of journal I assume they were journalists one of them
[02:41:10.480 --> 02:41:14.040]  looked like he was one of those camera guys who carries the giant camera on a
[02:41:14.040 --> 02:41:18.160]  shoulder one of those E and G cameras and they look like they were from Europe
[02:41:18.160 --> 02:41:21.520]  they're on this really small car they had them pulled off to the side as we were
[02:41:21.520 --> 02:41:26.400]  coming down it took a couple photos of them and they turned those guys away not
[02:41:26.400 --> 02:41:30.720]  like them they did no
[02:41:30.720 --> 02:41:42.520]  not proper credentials you carry mine mine mine they turn or I will help you
[02:41:42.520 --> 02:41:50.920]  not do that one mine mine mine well you're not oh my god you know so they
[02:41:50.920 --> 02:41:54.560]  turned this group away and they just like normal dude they had shorts and
[02:41:54.560 --> 02:41:57.760]  polo shirts on look like they were just coming up here to cover the event and
[02:41:57.760 --> 02:42:03.240]  they didn't have the proper paperwork I guess to get through so that's what's
[02:42:03.240 --> 02:42:07.840]  going on here in in Austria and we're giving people the real news I've seen
[02:42:07.840 --> 02:42:12.720]  reports that that we're sensationalists that we come and cover this but you know
[02:42:12.720 --> 02:42:17.200]  what if you're an agree and think that this is reasonable to have a checkpoint
[02:42:17.200 --> 02:42:21.920]  five six miles away from an event I mean that you guys but listen this is how
[02:42:21.920 --> 02:42:25.520]  they spin stuff first they said it didn't exist now they're setting up
[02:42:25.520 --> 02:42:30.680]  planetary government openly we're going under TPP the EU's a dictatorship a
[02:42:30.680 --> 02:42:36.500]  Nazi project on record it was covert the UK's trying to get out right now the
[02:42:36.500 --> 02:42:41.320]  globalists are setting up a global meltdown leader moving yeah the the the
[02:42:41.320 --> 02:42:45.080]  government security people run a mind-control torture castle according
[02:42:45.080 --> 02:42:50.600]  to the Boca Raton times I mean you cannot make this stuff up and then the
[02:42:50.600 --> 02:42:56.080]  media spends it that we're sensational no reality is sensational exactly and
[02:42:56.080 --> 02:42:59.960]  guess what we're winning guess what we're winning we're having a good time
[02:42:59.960 --> 02:43:03.840]  doing it and you got a bunch of people want to power grab and take over and
[02:43:03.840 --> 02:43:07.440]  that's what Germany and Austria were involved staging the Munich attack it's
[02:43:07.440 --> 02:43:12.000]  it's come out so decades later they can run around and harass journalists just
[02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:16.120]  like the Patriot acts used on a number one enemy veterans like Joe Biggs who's
[02:43:16.120 --> 02:43:19.320]  on a don't treat list the VA we know what's going on I want to get Paul
[02:43:19.320 --> 02:43:26.240]  Watson's take on all this Paul a secret government group called Cobra that's in
[02:43:26.240 --> 02:43:31.000]  a mind-control castle running security at Bilderberg that acts like Specter I
[02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:37.120]  mean you really can't make this up all the thing about it is no they try and
[02:43:37.120 --> 02:43:42.040]  make you feel guilty like your bat for wanting to cover this as a reporter or
[02:43:42.040 --> 02:43:46.520]  film the police or whatever when they're literally guarding a conference run by a
[02:43:46.520 --> 02:43:52.200]  war criminal in Henry Kissinger attended by three of the top people from
[02:43:52.200 --> 02:43:59.000]  HSBC who recently got fined again for a second time forty three million dollars
[02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:05.240]  for laundering money for drug dealers and arms dealers and yet where the bad
[02:44:05.240 --> 02:44:09.400]  people for wanting to cover this and yet that's what's taking place at Bilderberg
[02:44:09.400 --> 02:44:14.280]  and what they're discussing at Bilderberg is more capital controls the move
[02:44:14.280 --> 02:44:19.040]  towards the abolition of cash in the name of you know preventing tax fraud and
[02:44:19.040 --> 02:44:23.480]  terror financing to ISIS right let's talk about some of their agenda that you're
[02:44:23.480 --> 02:44:27.880]  what they admit is in their agenda the drudge linked to yesterday let's go over
[02:44:27.880 --> 02:44:31.920]  what they admit is in their agenda and then what our sources say is also there
[02:44:31.920 --> 02:44:36.200]  because they're trying to sow the planet up right now a b they've got to be mad
[02:44:36.200 --> 02:44:40.760]  it's already all over the European and British press it is not in the US press
[02:44:40.760 --> 02:44:46.320]  as usual go ahead well what they admit is in the agenda is basically meaningless
[02:44:46.320 --> 02:44:50.920]  because it's just a series of vague talking points like you know United
[02:44:50.920 --> 02:44:54.880]  Kingdom means absolutely nothing so what they're actually talking about from
[02:44:54.880 --> 02:44:58.640]  what they've said and what from the information we've got is and this is why
[02:44:58.640 --> 02:45:03.000]  Regina Duggan from Google is there this is why the guy from Google DeepMind is
[02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:08.120]  there selling artificial intelligence and big brother surveillance as trendy and
[02:45:08.120 --> 02:45:11.760]  cool that's what they've been working on for the past couple of years with this
[02:45:11.760 --> 02:45:17.360]  ingestible ID chip which Regina Duggan who of course is the former director of
[02:45:17.360 --> 02:45:22.760]  DARPA now a Google executive that's what she's working towards she's in
[02:45:22.760 --> 02:45:28.240]  attendance at Bilderberg for the first time with Google's Eric Smith sorry it
[02:45:28.240 --> 02:45:34.000]  was popping in some says the this is real dark side stuff yeah so they're
[02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:38.760]  basically gonna come out and say in the name of stopping ISIS which now the
[02:45:38.760 --> 02:45:44.080]  Pentagon's leaked report said they knew you they were creating a Salafist
[02:45:44.080 --> 02:45:48.320]  principality in the region by arming all these jihadist groups but never mind
[02:45:48.320 --> 02:45:52.720]  that in the name of stopping ISIS they're going to impose more capital
[02:45:52.720 --> 02:45:57.120]  controls on individuals so France from September is already banning cash
[02:45:57.120 --> 02:46:02.320]  transactions over 1000 euros that's what Bilderberg's gonna talk about because
[02:46:02.320 --> 02:46:06.680]  the very people there are allied with the institutions and the voices that are
[02:46:06.680 --> 02:46:12.960]  talking about abolishing cash all together eventually it's over the top
[02:46:12.960 --> 02:46:17.160]  yeah and I just want to add one thing there's another company the head of
[02:46:17.160 --> 02:46:20.200]  Siemens Corp is gonna be here and they're one of the most corrupt companies
[02:46:20.200 --> 02:46:23.880]  in Europe they've been fined over a billion dollars in corruption scandals
[02:46:23.880 --> 02:46:27.640]  I mean it's nothing but corrupt individuals these are the very same
[02:46:27.640 --> 02:46:31.920]  mega banks hill these are the very same mega banks I showed last hour just find
[02:46:31.920 --> 02:46:39.440]  5.8 million dollars for fixing the global money systems the currency
[02:46:39.440 --> 02:46:42.800]  speculation market every day that is a fraction of what they make per day
[02:46:42.800 --> 02:46:47.680]  Deutsche Bank hit with largest ever LIBOR fine a few years ago where all the
[02:46:47.680 --> 02:46:51.600]  big banks got caught fixing global interest rates and I mean everything is
[02:46:51.600 --> 02:46:55.840]  rigged ladies and gentlemen even the Rolling Stone magazine admits that and
[02:46:55.840 --> 02:47:01.120]  all we're doing is showing you who's rigging it the giant demonic possum
[02:47:01.120 --> 02:47:04.680]  Henry Kissinger the guy from Palantir is there too that large data mining
[02:47:04.680 --> 02:47:09.040]  company that's tied him with the NSA yeah and he's gonna be a they have three
[02:47:09.040 --> 02:47:13.000]  individuals from the the council or the Carnegie Endowment for International
[02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:16.960]  Peace and if people don't know that this group was creating a quarterbacks the
[02:47:16.960 --> 02:47:22.360]  whole show exactly they their first act was to write a letter to Woodrow Wilson
[02:47:22.360 --> 02:47:26.720]  to say hey keep World War one going we need this so we could change America
[02:47:26.720 --> 02:47:31.320]  fundamentally and create a legal action system that's right exactly and so
[02:47:31.320 --> 02:47:39.680]  they're they're going up there the Carnegie Endowment help put the Bolsheviks
[02:47:39.680 --> 02:47:43.080]  in that caused the reign of terror that killed over a hundred million people I
[02:47:43.080 --> 02:47:47.880]  mean these are evil folks figure out how to whitewash World War three how to
[02:47:47.880 --> 02:47:51.120]  turn it into something we need that's why they have these wait a minute are you
[02:47:51.120 --> 02:47:54.760]  being discriminatory against World War three now Rob I mean I've heard a lot of
[02:47:54.760 --> 02:48:02.960]  extremism but don't go that far he's racist he's racist you're a first it's
[02:48:02.960 --> 02:48:06.880]  not gonna affect the United States I mean unless it goes nuclear and then

[02:50:19.440 --> 02:50:23.560]  have to be made of all the available mindsites in the country but I would
[02:50:23.560 --> 02:50:29.080]  guess that a dwelling space for several hundred thousand of our people could
[02:50:29.080 --> 02:50:35.640]  easily be provided well I would hate to have to decide who stays up and who goes
[02:50:35.640 --> 02:50:41.880]  down that would not be necessary Mr. President could easily be accomplished
[02:50:41.880 --> 02:50:46.840]  with a computer and the computer could be set and programmed to accept practice

[02:51:07.120 --> 02:51:10.880]  there's a company called ID stronghold that makes shielded wallets to prevent
[02:51:10.880 --> 02:51:13.880]  electronic pickpocketing oh I didn't realize there was such a thing as
[02:51:13.880 --> 02:51:18.200]  electronic pickpocketing what is that well apparently many of the new credit
[02:51:18.200 --> 02:51:22.680]  and debit cards being issued have radio chips inside them called RFID the
[02:51:22.680 --> 02:51:27.000]  transmitter banking information to card readers when we pay unfortunately a bad
[02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:30.560]  guy can also get one of these readers and go around the city scanning people
[02:51:30.560 --> 02:51:34.200]  collecting their credit card numbers and personal information without us knowing
[02:51:34.200 --> 02:51:38.600]  it wow that sounds scary since you're getting a new wallet anyway you should

[02:54:24.560 --> 02:54:36.200]  leadership and tradition actually they would be prodigiously there would be much
[02:54:36.200 --> 02:54:44.240]  time and little to do with the proper beating techniques and ratio of say
[02:54:44.240 --> 02:54:49.880]  10 females to each male I would guess that they could then work their way back
[02:54:49.880 --> 02:54:56.160]  to the present gross national product we didn't say 20 years but look here doctor
[02:54:56.160 --> 02:55:01.640]  wouldn't this nucleus of survivors be so greased stricken and anguished that
[02:55:01.640 --> 02:55:06.640]  they well envy the dead and not want to go on living
[02:55:06.640 --> 02:55:14.640]  No sir. Excuse me.
[02:55:14.640 --> 02:55:19.440]  And then at the end George C. Scott jumps up and says Mr. President we must
[02:55:19.440 --> 02:55:23.280]  don't allow a mine shaft gap so they've already started nuclear war that's
[02:55:23.280 --> 02:55:26.280]  beginning in minutes the missiles are already being fired both directions the
[02:55:26.280 --> 02:55:29.440]  bombers and they're just busy thinking about how they're gonna get their tunnels
[02:55:29.440 --> 02:55:33.760]  the elite today are actually getting their bunkers their tunnels ready running
[02:55:33.760 --> 02:55:37.960]  to New Zealand I was told by Hollywood insiders like a year before it was
[02:55:37.960 --> 02:55:41.440]  announced that James Cameron thought this was all coming and left people made
[02:55:41.440 --> 02:55:46.240]  jokes about that by the way I shouldn't make jokes I do the show this is really
[02:55:46.240 --> 02:55:50.520]  scary stuff it's very saddening I was very serious the first hour or two I
[02:55:50.520 --> 02:55:55.120]  start making jokes at some point because we make a lot of this and even the crew
[02:55:55.120 --> 02:55:58.080]  my cousin was like I think you're screwing around too much having fun
[02:55:58.080 --> 02:56:02.080]  they don't normally give me advice we cope with gallows humor it's how we
[02:56:02.080 --> 02:56:06.760]  don't go crazy I mean it's better than turning stuff over but we're gonna have
[02:56:06.760 --> 02:56:11.200]  serious coverage of Bilderberg 2015 throughout this week it's truly
[02:56:11.200 --> 02:56:14.280]  disgusting I'm gonna do some overdrive and hit some other issues with this
[02:56:14.280 --> 02:56:17.800]  McKinney situation with the police and the pool party folks are out burning
[02:56:17.800 --> 02:56:21.240]  American flags now up there it's it's it's just really sad what's happened this
[02:56:21.240 --> 02:56:26.520]  chain reaction that the White House has basically set off using some real issues
[02:56:26.520 --> 02:56:30.000]  out there to fan the flames but I wanted to get a closing comment from Paul
[02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:35.040]  Watson and then from Rob do and Josh oh and so they're in Austria site of
[02:56:35.040 --> 02:56:42.840]  Bilderberg 2016 2015 about to kick off Paul Watson yeah apparently they escorted
[02:56:42.840 --> 02:56:47.200]  Charlie Skelton of the Guardian back to his hotel in two police vans they gave
[02:56:47.200 --> 02:56:51.680]  him a personal escort he couldn't even get past the checkpoint so you know that
[02:56:51.680 --> 02:56:55.040]  if they want to draw more attention to themselves then keep doing it because
[02:56:55.040 --> 02:56:59.280]  it'll just make more headlines and shine for the spotlight on Bilderberg but
[02:56:59.280 --> 02:57:04.120]  we've got some of the agenda going up in a video in the next half an hour or so
[02:57:04.120 --> 02:57:07.120]  and then we'll get the rest of the text up after that so that's going up on
[02:57:07.120 --> 02:57:11.120]  info wars.com soon this is from our high-level sources folks this is a big
[02:57:11.120 --> 02:57:15.840]  deal and we should go to the hotel where Skelton is based if you have that info
[02:57:15.840 --> 02:57:20.800]  please give that to Rob do so he can go interview Skelton about his situation
[02:57:20.800 --> 02:57:25.280]  that's a major London Guardian reporter and this is how they respond did he try
[02:57:25.280 --> 02:57:30.600]  to walk up there or did they take his car? No from my understand he drove up
[02:57:30.600 --> 02:57:34.160]  there in in his own car and then they just turned him back then gave him a
[02:57:34.160 --> 02:57:38.680]  personal escort with two police fans full of cops behind him all the way back
[02:57:38.680 --> 02:57:43.320]  to his own hotel so that's the London Guardian undoubtedly the biggest
[02:57:43.320 --> 02:57:47.360]  English language paper in Europe not just the UK I mean that's the paper they
[02:57:47.360 --> 02:57:52.920]  read that they print on newsstands all over Europe so we're talking 400 million
[02:57:52.920 --> 02:57:56.400]  people have access to it and that's how they act I mean that's like the New York
[02:57:56.400 --> 02:58:00.800]  Times. He posted a picture right before that happened to on his Twitter showing
[02:58:00.800 --> 02:58:04.240]  the checkpoint as he approached and then saying hey I'm being escorted out now by
[02:58:04.240 --> 02:58:08.600]  police let's show his Twitter if we can this is simply I keep using the word
[02:58:08.600 --> 02:58:14.520]  amazing Paul what do you make of this stupid that's what it is because they're
[02:58:14.520 --> 02:58:18.480]  just giving us more content more videos and more headlines if they don't want
[02:58:18.480 --> 02:58:22.640]  to draw attention to themselves then be reasonable and don't harass journalists
[02:58:22.640 --> 02:58:28.760]  it's pretty simple well I mean look at how the UK police acted yeah now there
[02:58:28.760 --> 02:58:31.920]  were no stories about police brutality out of that or harassment they were
[02:58:31.920 --> 02:58:35.640]  known out of Copenhagen well they didn't even arrest me when I did bust the blockade
[02:58:35.640 --> 02:58:39.760]  and got on the barge because they knew it was the first amendment free speech
[02:58:39.760 --> 02:58:42.920]  over there but the cops are telling me privately they agree with me great job
[02:58:42.920 --> 02:58:47.340]  Watson great job everybody everybody stay there I'm gonna come back to Paul
[02:58:47.340 --> 02:58:53.320]  then the guys in bigs introducing secret 12 the new info wars life vitamin b12

[02:59:50.040 --> 02:59:56.280]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[03:00:01.040 --> 03:00:06.800]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information
[03:00:06.800 --> 03:00:12.520]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network some of the breaking
[03:00:12.520 --> 03:00:18.760]  news up on info wars.com is having added to it right now screenshots of these
[03:00:18.760 --> 03:00:22.720]  magazine articles and news articles going back even into the 70s about Cobra
[03:00:22.720 --> 03:00:29.640]  that's guarding we're not joking that's guarding the Bilderberg group from the
[03:00:29.640 --> 03:00:33.280]  press and acting like the press is evil and the reason I started getting goofy
[03:00:33.280 --> 03:00:37.840]  last hour is you got a group called Cobra that's in a castle where they
[03:00:37.840 --> 03:00:41.480]  admittedly mind control and torture people and it's in major Florida
[03:00:41.480 --> 03:00:46.760]  newspapers and then that's who's running security it's just upside down world as
[03:00:46.760 --> 03:00:50.000]  I said at the start of the broadcast it's bizarre final comment on that Paul
[03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:55.440]  Watson yeah again it's stupid because they're gonna draw more attention to
[03:00:55.440 --> 03:00:58.760]  themselves and otherwise would have happened so what we're gonna get more
[03:00:58.760 --> 03:01:03.720]  headlines and more news stories out of it one more thing on the agenda they're
[03:01:03.720 --> 03:01:09.320]  talking about arming the Ukrainian militias these openly neo-nazi militants
[03:01:09.320 --> 03:01:14.160]  who you know string people up on crosses burn them alive hang people from the
[03:01:14.160 --> 03:01:18.640]  neck so they're openly talking about arming them and possibly stoking a
[03:01:18.640 --> 03:01:22.440]  major confrontation between Russia and NATO before the end of the year this is
[03:01:22.440 --> 03:01:27.280]  Bilderberg agenda this is Bilderberg agenda yeah same thing with the South
[03:01:27.280 --> 03:01:32.400]  China Sea situation there they're gonna not basically give China any room for
[03:01:32.400 --> 03:01:35.640]  maneuver on that so again possible confrontation people have talked about
[03:01:35.640 --> 03:01:40.480]  China-US relations being the worst in 20 30 years so there's the problem you
[03:01:40.480 --> 03:01:43.960]  can't maneuver the Chinese into a war like we did the Japanese because there's
[03:01:43.960 --> 03:01:48.680]  nuclear weapons now and I'm not saying the Imperial Japanese didn't deserve
[03:01:48.680 --> 03:01:54.040]  some of it they were pretty bad but the Chinese have got nuclear weapons well
[03:01:54.040 --> 03:01:57.960]  there's there's no Chinese representation at Bilderberg there has been a
[03:01:57.960 --> 03:02:01.160]  smattering of it in recent years but they've been completely frozen out now
[03:02:01.160 --> 03:02:05.000]  so they're definitely you know trying to dismantle the bricks ability to have
[03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:10.160]  any influence or challenge just like Putin was kicked out of G7 from G8 and
[03:02:10.160 --> 03:02:14.120]  now the Chinese called that totalitarian yeah they said it was
[03:02:14.120 --> 03:02:18.080]  authoritarian rule you also got Jim Messina of the Messina group who ran
[03:02:18.080 --> 03:02:23.640]  Obama's 2012 reelection campaign he's now advising Hillary so his job will be to
[03:02:23.640 --> 03:02:27.720]  basically strangle any funding any financing for the other potential
[03:02:27.720 --> 03:02:31.640]  presidential candidates that will run against Hillary so that will be his role
[03:02:31.640 --> 03:02:37.520]  at Bilderberg 2015 Paul you are such a on-target great reporter it how long we
[03:02:37.520 --> 03:02:43.280]  working together with 13 14 years something like that yeah longer since
[03:02:43.280 --> 03:02:47.680]  2002 I think aren't you glad I forced you to do video blogs forced you to get on
[03:02:47.680 --> 03:02:52.680]  air with us remember that definitely it's all picking up now and you know I'm
[03:02:52.680 --> 03:02:59.640]  looking forward to getting out there I'm there with a gun you're there with a
[03:02:59.640 --> 03:03:06.320]  belt feeding me it's worked out pretty well so far of course folks I said I
[03:03:06.320 --> 03:03:12.440]  quit joking around that's a doctor's train's love joke isn't it Paul that
[03:03:12.440 --> 03:03:17.280]  you've been doing for about a decade well what I call up once you do a story I
[03:03:17.280 --> 03:03:20.560]  go even if it's like midnight your time it's an emergency right the story Paul
[03:03:20.560 --> 03:03:26.800]  come on come on the Red Cubs are coming you get over there feeding that belt boy
[03:03:26.800 --> 03:03:31.920]  I mean do you like working for General Jack T Ripper just let's be honest yeah
[03:03:31.920 --> 03:03:35.880]  it's a lot of fun all right we're gonna do 15 more minutes overdrive and let Paul
[03:03:35.880 --> 03:03:39.080]  go right here I'm gonna come back with bigs have about five minutes and then
[03:03:39.080 --> 03:03:45.120]  final comments from our two reporters that are there Rob do and of course
[03:03:45.120 --> 03:03:48.840]  Josh Owens but one minute to break Paul other other bombshells are gonna drop
[03:03:48.840 --> 03:03:54.440]  on us it's all about rebranding authoritarianism they know that these
[03:03:54.440 --> 03:03:58.160]  riots are coming this civil unrest you had the billionaire only owner of
[03:03:58.160 --> 03:04:02.720]  Cartier the other day saying that he's afraid that these these artificial
[03:04:02.720 --> 03:04:06.640]  intelligent robots will replace people will basically make them lose their
[03:04:06.640 --> 03:04:11.240]  jobs that that's gonna cause a mass uprising so basically Bilderberg wants
[03:04:11.240 --> 03:04:15.280]  more class warfare and civil unrest like George Soros said was coming back in
[03:04:15.280 --> 03:04:19.160]  2012 now he's funding Black Lives Matter and all these movements that are
[03:04:19.160 --> 03:04:23.840]  creating that but smart billionaires almost to a man or woman who made their
[03:04:23.840 --> 03:04:27.680]  money are freaked out trying to stabilize things so there are some good
[03:04:27.680 --> 03:04:33.200]  forces out there yeah and you know sometimes they invite kind of mavericks
[03:04:33.200 --> 03:04:36.920]  from the outside but then you've got all these Google people there Elon Musk
[03:04:36.920 --> 03:04:41.000]  says that Google's basically creating an army of robots that's gonna wipe out
[03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:45.400]  humanity and now they invited another one from Google this year so it seems
[03:04:45.400 --> 03:04:49.280]  pretty clear that Bilderberg is fully behind that well you're gonna be

[03:06:06.480 --> 03:06:11.560]  info wars.com because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest
[03:06:11.560 --> 03:06:16.240]  quality and they weren't as affordable as they should be so I refused probably

[03:08:16.920 --> 03:08:27.160]  in Austria Rob do last week had the idea to have me voice that piece of
[03:08:27.160 --> 03:08:30.160]  green put it together where Obi-Wan Kenobi's looking at a law-sized space
[03:08:30.160 --> 03:08:34.920]  port he says you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy it
[03:08:34.920 --> 03:08:38.520]  actually worked out pretty good and it's it's turning out worse than we thought
[03:08:38.520 --> 03:08:41.920]  can you imagine how bad the police state's gonna be when this thing actually
[03:08:41.920 --> 03:08:45.960]  kicks off Thursday and the private jets oh yeah go to the nearby airport that's
[03:08:45.960 --> 03:08:50.000]  what they'll be landing and then see how the cops act there whenever you're
[03:08:50.000 --> 03:08:54.480]  trying to follow the sedans or videotape it which is what the press would do I
[03:08:54.480 --> 03:08:58.440]  mean when you've got the Kardashians having a marriage there's 18 helicopters
[03:08:58.440 --> 03:09:03.960]  over it yeah this is 150 world leaders we're not idiots we try to cover stuff
[03:09:03.960 --> 03:09:07.680]  that really is important not all the distractions we're gonna get Joe Big's
[03:09:07.680 --> 03:09:11.320]  take on all this in a moment but finishing up Rob do and Josh Owens
[03:09:11.320 --> 03:09:16.560]  from there in Austria in the Alps close to Bilderberg they've already gone
[03:09:16.560 --> 03:09:20.880]  through two checkpoints to get to where they are other observations I'd like to
[03:09:20.880 --> 03:09:25.160]  talk to Josh in a moment as well and what are you going to do next Rob do
[03:09:25.160 --> 03:09:29.400]  sure well we have a couple reports we need to put together we want to get
[03:09:29.400 --> 03:09:33.880]  those out that before they don't become timely but what's interesting I'm
[03:09:33.880 --> 03:09:37.120]  sitting out here at the back porch looking into the valley there's two
[03:09:37.120 --> 03:09:42.200]  horses in front of me eating grass just like oblivious to the fact that the
[03:09:42.200 --> 03:09:45.840]  world leaders are going to be here and it's just amazing that all around this
[03:09:45.840 --> 03:09:50.280]  there's cops walking in the woods there's cops at the entrance to the dirt road
[03:09:50.280 --> 03:09:54.400]  to our hotel which incidentally that Charlie Skelton was supposed to stay at
[03:09:54.400 --> 03:09:58.880]  our hotel up here on the Mount so I'm not sure where he's at now but he was
[03:09:58.880 --> 03:10:02.120]  supposed to be up here I was looking forward to finally meeting him in person
[03:10:02.120 --> 03:10:06.480]  because I remember talking to him when he finally when he turned when he was
[03:10:06.480 --> 03:10:10.840]  making a big joke about the whole Bilderberg group haha I'm a comedian guy
[03:10:10.840 --> 03:10:16.160]  and then he got arrested twice and I believe it was Greece where he was at
[03:10:16.160 --> 03:10:20.800]  and you know it's just people don't realize how real it is because they
[03:10:20.800 --> 03:10:23.800]  read all this stuff in the newspapers that are like oh it's fake group it
[03:10:23.800 --> 03:10:27.880]  doesn't exist well if it's so fake why are there checkpoints everywhere why do
[03:10:27.880 --> 03:10:32.440]  I have a van a cop at the hotel that I'm at and then another van a cop at the
[03:10:32.440 --> 03:10:37.160]  entrance to the hotel to the road and then there's two checkpoints going down
[03:10:37.160 --> 03:10:42.880]  to the village why so much security because this George Carlin said my
[03:10:42.880 --> 03:10:48.720]  mind because George Carlin said the owners are in control you ain't in it it's
[03:10:48.720 --> 03:10:53.160]  a big club you ain't in it yeah group yeah that's a club they beat you over the
[03:10:53.160 --> 03:11:00.040]  head with I want to get George Carlin had it right I want to get Josh how it's
[03:11:00.040 --> 03:11:05.280]  take on this situation in in closing good job guys great job let's talk to Josh
[03:11:05.280 --> 03:11:08.680]  Owens here real quick a fellow reporter with Rob do be just trying to hand him
[03:11:08.680 --> 03:11:18.600]  the phone hold on one second they don't get your take okay I'm here okay Josh
[03:11:18.600 --> 03:11:26.080]  give us your take on what you've seen unfold so far well I think these are
[03:11:26.080 --> 03:11:29.880]  just a bunch of nice guys that are just trying to help us out you know they
[03:11:29.880 --> 03:11:33.280]  seem like good people I don't think he was really trying to turn my phone off I
[03:11:33.280 --> 03:11:37.320]  think he was just trying to help me save my battery okay so I know we were
[03:11:37.320 --> 03:11:40.000]  screwed on earlier but we're not now are you telling me they grabbed at your
[03:11:40.000 --> 03:11:43.880]  telephone tell us what happened yeah well when we walked into the police
[03:11:43.880 --> 03:11:49.320]  station the one guy who came up there was a female sitting down you you guys
[03:11:49.320 --> 03:11:53.680]  saw it live and there was another guy that walked up and he said what are you
[03:11:53.680 --> 03:11:57.640]  doing and I said filming and he lunged for my camera and then I pulled it back
[03:11:57.640 --> 03:12:01.880]  and he just walked off I think he knew that he knew there was nothing he could
[03:12:01.880 --> 03:12:07.080]  do well there's your headline Austrian police try to take reporters camera yeah
[03:12:07.080 --> 03:12:14.560]  he was an intimidation tactic well we've looked and there's no law Charlie
[03:12:14.560 --> 03:12:17.680]  Skelton was escorted back by two vehicles even though he was supposedly
[03:12:17.680 --> 03:12:20.920]  staying at the same lodge as you so I guess they've gotten to the point now of
[03:12:20.920 --> 03:12:23.520]  not letting people through I guess you're lucky you even made it through
[03:12:23.520 --> 03:12:29.920]  Austrian police lunge at first amendment yeah well when we had when we got
[03:12:29.920 --> 03:12:34.600]  stopped at the checkpoint they made me open every zipper of every bag and they
[03:12:34.600 --> 03:12:39.000]  even tore up the poultry in the back where there's usually a tire under there
[03:12:39.000 --> 03:12:43.000]  they opened it up there's no tire there and they ripped up the upholstery they
[03:12:43.000 --> 03:12:45.720]  pulled up the upholstery to see if I'm not sure what they thought we were
[03:12:45.720 --> 03:12:53.000]  smuggling in but yeah it's outrageous it's unbelievable well it's a major
[03:12:53.000 --> 03:12:57.520]  governmental secret policy meeting that's totally illegal in the US and other
[03:12:57.520 --> 03:13:01.880]  laws violates the Logan Act and so many others it's racketeering I mean they
[03:13:01.880 --> 03:13:05.400]  talk about the soccer association meeting in secret stuff this is the real
[03:13:05.400 --> 03:13:10.360]  deal and then the people that go from LIBOR with all the rigging of the banks
[03:13:10.360 --> 03:13:13.640]  rigging of the interest rates rigging of the currency rates this is a criminal
[03:13:13.640 --> 03:13:18.680]  mafia this is the mega mafia 2.0 all right well Josh anything else you'd like
[03:13:18.680 --> 03:13:24.480]  to add I just I believe you know this is just a second day we've been here and I
[03:13:24.480 --> 03:13:27.480]  hate to say it but it seems like this stuff is just gonna keep getting worse
[03:13:27.480 --> 03:13:30.760]  you know they freaked out at first when we weren't filming and we're crazy when
[03:13:30.760 --> 03:13:35.320]  we were filming we got kicked out of the police station this time the first time
[03:13:35.320 --> 03:13:38.400]  they just looked at our bags this time that we had to open every single
[03:13:38.400 --> 03:13:41.880]  compartment in the bag then they ripped up the upholstery is there's no telling
[03:13:41.880 --> 03:13:48.000]  where it's gonna go day three four five six seven it it's gonna be it's
[03:13:48.000 --> 03:13:52.760]  unbelievable as the Bilderberg hasn't even started let me put it that way
[03:13:52.760 --> 03:13:57.000]  Bilderberg hasn't even started and it's already descended into this ridiculous
[03:13:57.000 --> 03:14:03.280]  thank you so much Josh Owens be safe we'll pray for you drudgereport.com is
[03:14:03.280 --> 03:14:08.040]  breaking the electronic Berlin wall but drudge has to link to foreign press
[03:14:08.040 --> 03:14:13.120]  drudge has to link to foreign press like the London Guardian the Independent
[03:14:13.120 --> 03:14:18.640]  and others to get English speaking news forget G7 G7 summit Bilderberg is
[03:14:18.640 --> 03:14:24.320]  where the big guns go businesses bosses lobby politicians on future of EU and
[03:14:24.320 --> 03:14:31.240]  then info wars.com abolition of cash capital controls and our story breaking
[03:14:31.240 --> 03:14:35.600]  that down by Paul Joseph Watson Paul writes the powerful Bilderberg group
[03:14:35.600 --> 03:14:40.720]  will discuss imposing more capital controls on average citizens while HSBC
[03:14:40.720 --> 03:14:45.640]  whose group chairman will attend the conference is set to pay more than 40
[03:14:45.640 --> 03:14:49.640]  million dollars for illegal money laundering involving arms dealers and
[03:14:49.640 --> 03:14:54.040]  helping the wealthy avoid taxes well what does Hillary do she gets money at
[03:14:54.040 --> 03:14:57.200]  her foundation when she headed up the State Department to let dictators get
[03:14:57.200 --> 03:15:02.240]  weapons I mean these are the real criminals folks it's very much a case of
[03:15:02.240 --> 03:15:07.240]  do as I say not as I do and they want to get rid of cash they admit in press
[03:15:07.240 --> 03:15:13.520]  releases so they can tax our money in bail ins like they're doing in Europe
[03:15:13.520 --> 03:15:17.680]  taking our money so we can't take it put in a mattress they want us fully under
[03:15:17.680 --> 03:15:22.240]  their digital control very important article by Paul Joseph Watson and I
[03:15:22.240 --> 03:15:26.960]  salute Matt drugs for being the only big media he is alternative media but big
[03:15:26.960 --> 03:15:33.760]  media to cover Bilderberg others are ridiculing us I've got the clips I'm
[03:15:33.760 --> 03:15:37.040]  not gonna give them attention mainline conservatives are saying we're full of
[03:15:37.040 --> 03:15:40.600]  prunes all right Joe Biggs you've got five minutes you've got the floor till we
[03:15:40.600 --> 03:15:44.240]  end the transmission your overall view on this your overall view on Cobra and
[03:15:44.240 --> 03:15:47.600]  where you see this going yeah I definitely see this ramping up more and
[03:15:47.600 --> 03:15:51.160]  more like Josh said the security presence definitely gonna stand up and once
[03:15:51.160 --> 03:15:55.000]  these elites are coming in to play and these guys are convoying in you can see
[03:15:55.000 --> 03:15:59.480]  a whole grid lockdown and like I said my concern is that these guys are really
[03:15:59.480 --> 03:16:06.040]  being extra careful because these guys like I said they kind of you know they
[03:16:06.040 --> 03:16:09.720]  kind of go after the ways like the FBI did so like you said the comparison and
[03:16:09.720 --> 03:16:13.200]  we know how the FBI in America stages things as well so I just hope these
[03:16:13.200 --> 03:16:19.360]  guys are taking extra priority taking extra steps to make sure that they are
[03:16:19.360 --> 03:16:24.520]  checking behind themselves checking their hotel and just overall security of
[03:16:24.520 --> 03:16:27.640]  what's going on because I wouldn't put it past these guys to do something like
[03:16:27.640 --> 03:16:31.680]  that because like you said it's every day it's ramping up more and more these
[03:16:31.680 --> 03:16:35.080]  guys are walking through the woods you've got the guy who owns this room where
[03:16:35.080 --> 03:16:37.600]  they're saying saying that there's a good chance it could come back at night
[03:16:37.600 --> 03:16:40.860]  time so I'm hoping that you know they can keep a good eye out also get some
[03:16:40.860 --> 03:16:47.560]  rest but maintain some discipline and keep an eye on I almost said you but
[03:16:47.560 --> 03:16:52.000]  you've been so busy and you wanted to go but I haven't sent Rob do and Josh
[03:16:52.000 --> 03:16:57.120]  on something in a while I know there's some things breaking down up in McKinney
[03:16:57.120 --> 03:17:02.040]  by Dallas and you might be going up to that but what would you be doing right
[03:17:02.040 --> 03:17:05.720]  now if you were in Austria well definitely pulling back looking at those
[03:17:05.720 --> 03:17:10.760]  maps trying to see if I can find some alternate routes maybe circle around into
[03:17:10.760 --> 03:17:14.280]  some other cities and then try to come in there was another back way maybe they
[03:17:14.280 --> 03:17:17.560]  don't have as much security there I don't know but definitely look at those
[03:17:17.560 --> 03:17:20.400]  alternate routes and all you want to do is videotape the building I mean be a
[03:17:20.400 --> 03:17:24.800]  journalist yeah I mean I'm gonna go out and hike and get through the woods and
[03:17:24.800 --> 03:17:29.840]  find out what's going on I mean I'd be kind of curious to see how they react if
[03:17:29.840 --> 03:17:32.760]  they approach you in the woods if they were to take a hike and go up in one of
[03:17:32.760 --> 03:17:37.200]  those trails and see what would happen with that as well you know what do you
[03:17:37.200 --> 03:17:43.200]  think the strategy is putting checkpoint six miles away it's to for
[03:17:43.200 --> 03:17:46.520]  something like that when you do roving checkpoints and you move them around you
[03:17:46.520 --> 03:17:49.720]  do that whenever you think or you've been told by your higher up that there's a
[03:17:49.720 --> 03:17:53.120]  chance that there could be some kind of like outside attack and like I said
[03:17:53.120 --> 03:17:56.160]  that's what concerns me about how they're saying they're like the FBI we
[03:17:56.160 --> 03:18:00.640]  know that the FBI stage things before and this would be a way to lock
[03:18:00.640 --> 03:18:04.960]  everything down and then not allow anything in there whatsoever and they
[03:18:04.960 --> 03:18:07.880]  could do their secret meeting and then go on about their way and detain
[03:18:07.880 --> 03:18:16.040]  journalists shifting gears the Soros destabilization program is in full swing
[03:18:16.040 --> 03:18:19.760]  what do you think of that video the cops mainly grabbing black kids at a
[03:18:19.760 --> 03:18:25.320]  swimming pool in McKinney up by Dallas and then now I think the cop is a
[03:18:25.320 --> 03:18:29.640]  little out of control but then now the response of burning American flags and
[03:18:29.640 --> 03:18:33.200]  stuff how is that now the default response because you get these same
[03:18:33.200 --> 03:18:37.360]  George Soros funded people coming in these these ponds that are working for
[03:18:37.360 --> 03:18:41.520]  him they show up to there's this one guy's names DeRay something he he shows
[03:18:41.520 --> 03:18:45.200]  up at every protest he's got like 140,000 Twitter followers and he's like
[03:18:45.200 --> 03:18:51.080]  the main like voice he's like the celebrity black lives matter guy and he
[03:18:51.080 --> 03:18:56.120]  tweeted out last night said oh my god it was so nice to come to Texas and see so
[03:18:56.120 --> 03:19:01.120]  many familiar faces people from Ferguson Baltimore Cleveland DC it's the same
[03:19:01.120 --> 03:19:05.800]  people to go around to all these things they take an incident and then they blow
[03:19:05.800 --> 03:19:09.800]  it up and then they're out there just trying to get a paycheck you know what's
[03:19:09.800 --> 03:19:14.480]  happening McKinney yeah the officer to pull a gun on a bunch of teenagers and
[03:19:14.480 --> 03:19:18.120]  they're obviously in bathing suits at a pool party that's pretty extreme and
[03:19:18.120 --> 03:19:22.640]  they're just standing like 10 feet away yeah but again they're just training the
[03:19:22.640 --> 03:19:26.640]  cop stack like your commandos in World War one or something and they're just so
[03:19:26.640 --> 03:19:31.000]  ready to go it's just explosive well I mean you know when I was a kid I've had
[03:19:31.000 --> 03:19:33.920]  run-ins with police and they would always approach you ask you what was
[03:19:33.920 --> 03:19:38.360]  going on and then you know as the last resort ever reach for a gun now it's a
[03:19:38.360 --> 03:19:41.920]  reach for the gun first and then try to figure everything out later on in court
[03:19:41.920 --> 03:19:45.680]  and it escalates everything it's just crazy and then the globalists that have
[03:19:45.680 --> 03:19:49.480]  engineered this mindset are gonna play on that to make it even worse that's it
