[00:00.000 --> 00:13.640]  Broadcasting live from the U.N. Stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex
[00:13.640 --> 00:24.600]  Jones show and now your host, David Knight.
[00:24.600 --> 00:27.800]  Welcome it's June 18th, 2020, I'm David Knight, your host.
[00:27.800 --> 00:30.480]  You'll be hearing from Alex Jones in this hour.
[00:30.480 --> 00:36.560]  We're going to be taking a look at what is happening with the book release with Bolton.
[00:36.560 --> 00:40.680]  And I think there's a much more important story here than just the back and forth that
[00:40.680 --> 00:41.680]  he said she said.
[00:41.680 --> 00:46.400]  I'm going to take a look at what kind of guy Bolton is and why was he ever there?
[00:46.400 --> 00:53.040]  We're going to go back and take a look at the war that is really developed between the
[00:53.040 --> 00:58.080]  Neocons and the Pentagon as you've seen in the last few weeks.
[00:58.080 --> 01:03.240]  This is coming to a head and we're going to show you this from the two different factions
[01:03.240 --> 01:04.680]  in Washington.
[01:04.680 --> 01:09.560]  One of them represented by Rand Paul, probably the best example of people who support what
[01:09.560 --> 01:13.040]  President Trump said as a candidate, he's supported and the people who've been fighting
[01:13.040 --> 01:21.160]  President Trump and people like Flynn, interestingly enough Bolton was there as a possible replacement
[01:21.160 --> 01:23.000]  for Flynn right from the very beginning.
[01:23.000 --> 01:25.680]  He was considered for that replacement position.
[01:25.680 --> 01:32.440]  He came on in another position, came on later in 2018.
[01:32.440 --> 01:35.560]  But we're going to go back and look at the history of this.
[01:35.560 --> 01:40.280]  Look at the good angel sitting on President Trump's shoulder, Rand Paul.
[01:40.280 --> 01:41.360]  You don't want to do this.
[01:41.360 --> 01:42.800]  You don't want to set the world on fire.
[01:42.800 --> 01:47.840]  And the bad guy, the little devil sitting on his other shoulder whispering in his ear,
[01:47.840 --> 01:52.040]  let's bomb everybody as President Trump said at one point time, we'd be on World War Six
[01:52.040 --> 01:53.440]  right now if I listen to this guy.
[01:53.440 --> 01:56.480]  And quite frankly, that is the case.
[01:56.480 --> 02:04.560]  And we had the left that was always criticizing Bolton for being a Dr. Strange Love neocon
[02:04.560 --> 02:05.920]  until now.
[02:05.920 --> 02:10.360]  And now he's their hero because he's doing an orange man bad book.
[02:10.360 --> 02:12.720]  So we're going to take a look at that before we do real quickly.
[02:12.720 --> 02:19.400]  Some of the top news here, of course, you see gone with the wind now has exploded everywhere.
[02:19.400 --> 02:23.000]  Because they purged it, it is now number one in sales.
[02:23.000 --> 02:25.320]  And quite frankly, it's kind of the Streisand effect, right?
[02:25.320 --> 02:29.520]  You know, you're going to push back and say, don't watch this while everybody's going to
[02:29.520 --> 02:31.320]  go watch it.
[02:31.320 --> 02:36.160]  And as I said before, it's about much more than the Civil War.
[02:36.160 --> 02:39.000]  You know when it came out in 1939?
[02:39.000 --> 02:44.480]  It hearkened back to the previous fourth turning, which was a civil war.
[02:44.480 --> 02:50.960]  And people right then were on well into the next fourth turning, which was the Great Depression
[02:50.960 --> 02:51.960]  of World War Two.
[02:51.960 --> 02:54.240]  They were on the cusp of World War Two.
[02:54.240 --> 03:03.720]  World War Two had begun officially in a couple of months earlier, September the 29th in 1939
[03:03.720 --> 03:06.760]  when Hitler invaded Poland.
[03:06.760 --> 03:12.040]  And it was released in December, middle of December, and people could look at that and
[03:12.040 --> 03:15.960]  they could see how their society was setting on the precipice, how everything that they
[03:15.960 --> 03:18.520]  had could immediately be erased.
[03:18.520 --> 03:25.720]  Now people who were in a very wealthy, comfortable position could eventually be digging for potatoes
[03:25.720 --> 03:27.440]  because they're starving.
[03:27.440 --> 03:30.440]  Quite frankly, that's a position we find ourselves in today.
[03:30.440 --> 03:32.480]  We are at the next fourth turning.
[03:32.480 --> 03:37.240]  Fourth turning is as Strauss and Howe pointed out, happened about every four generations
[03:37.240 --> 03:38.520]  about every 80 years.
[03:38.520 --> 03:43.440]  They predicted in early 90s that by the mid-2000s there might be some kind of a, they predicted
[03:43.440 --> 03:49.040]  a major global economic event, you know, like around 2007, 2008, remember that?
[03:49.040 --> 03:54.360]  While they predicted it in the early 90s, they said it would set off a fourth turning.
[03:54.360 --> 04:00.320]  It would restructure society, it would be accompanied by massive economic pain, and usually
[04:00.320 --> 04:02.320]  by a massive war.
[04:02.320 --> 04:08.960]  It would all be finished by about 2029, 2030, which is one of the reasons why the UN has
[04:08.960 --> 04:12.760]  a pick that date for how they want what they want society to look like.
[04:12.760 --> 04:15.920]  So we're in the middle of that right now, but you know, we look at the Streisand effect
[04:15.920 --> 04:16.920]  with that.
[04:16.920 --> 04:22.560]  Maybe that's one of the reasons why the makers of Aunt Jemima syrup decided that they would
[04:22.560 --> 04:24.080]  take that off.
[04:24.080 --> 04:30.640]  Maybe it was more about that because they had already had a person on the label, you
[04:30.640 --> 04:32.480]  know, Uncle Ben, is he going to go now?
[04:32.480 --> 04:38.240]  As you have Babylon B saying, maybe we're going to change a cracker jack to a Caucasian
[04:38.240 --> 04:39.240]  jack.
[04:39.240 --> 04:42.920]  Everybody's got to get in on the act because, you know, with the Streisand effect, they
[04:42.920 --> 04:44.760]  could increase their sales, right?
[04:44.760 --> 04:46.520]  Maybe that's what it's really about.
[04:46.520 --> 04:47.520]  We'll be right back.
[04:47.520 --> 04:59.320]  Stay with us.
[04:59.320 --> 05:04.440]  It's finally here introducing the first of its kind, nascent iodine spray with true atomic
[05:04.440 --> 05:05.440]  iodine.
[05:05.440 --> 05:09.640]  Listers have been asking us for months to develop an iodine spray made with our exclusive
[05:09.640 --> 05:11.880]  deep earth crystal nascent iodine.
[05:11.880 --> 05:13.840]  After extensive development, it's finally here.
[05:13.840 --> 05:18.480]  Our proprietary new aerodyne technology allows us to harness the full power of ancient iodine
[05:18.480 --> 05:22.800]  crystals from 7,000 feet below the earth's surface into an ultimate spray formula.
[05:22.800 --> 05:26.960]  I have been using the new X2 spray every day and I feel good knowing that I have the power
[05:26.960 --> 05:29.320]  of true nascent iodine working for my body.
[05:29.320 --> 05:31.000]  I can personally feel the difference.
[05:31.000 --> 05:35.360]  We know iodine is an essential mineral that supports thyroid health as well as healthy
[05:35.360 --> 05:39.440]  metabolism, healthy hormone levels and healthy cognitive function.
[05:39.440 --> 05:44.000]  Iodine may also support your body and healthy response to environmental and dietary toxins.
[05:44.000 --> 05:48.440]  Get your daily dose of essential iodine and experience the benefits of true nascent iodine
[05:48.440 --> 05:49.440]  today.

[05:54.800 --> 05:56.520]  of our new limited first shipment.

[06:05.560 --> 06:12.960]  You found it, the tip of the spear, it is the Alex Jones show.
[06:12.960 --> 06:27.240]  And now, your host, David Knight.
[06:27.240 --> 06:29.760]  Welcome, it's June 18th, year of our Lord, 2020, on David Knight, your host.
[06:29.760 --> 06:33.520]  Start the program that proceeds this program each day with a countdown of how long we've
[06:33.520 --> 06:36.440]  been held hostage.
[06:36.440 --> 06:43.080]  We go back to remember the Iranian hostage taking when they took over the U.S. Embassy
[06:43.080 --> 06:47.560]  and they held hostages for something like 400 days and you had the pictures of them
[06:47.560 --> 06:48.560]  blindfolded.
[06:48.560 --> 06:54.440]  They took them out on a daily basis and it made the nightline program that started talking
[06:54.440 --> 06:56.480]  about that made it a regular fixture.
[06:56.480 --> 07:01.400]  I hope that this doesn't become a regular fixture, but we're now into day 93 of our
[07:01.400 --> 07:02.400]  lockdown.
[07:02.400 --> 07:07.040]  They've eased up a little bit and they've pushed the pause button, but they're about
[07:07.040 --> 07:08.480]  ready to start that up again.
[07:08.480 --> 07:11.640]  And they haven't taken away all of the regulations.
[07:11.640 --> 07:16.440]  And that's part of what these people have planned to do.
[07:16.440 --> 07:20.880]  It is not unrelated to what is going on with Black Lives Matter, Antifa, the other unrest
[07:20.880 --> 07:21.880]  that is happening.
[07:21.880 --> 07:26.160]  They intend to create a civil war, as I pointed out yesterday, we have a UN official and I'll
[07:26.160 --> 07:29.800]  tell you a little bit more about this as well as an update as to where we are right now
[07:29.800 --> 07:36.840]  in terms of America being held hostage, about the masking, about the contact tracing and
[07:36.840 --> 07:40.200]  testing, and about the vaccination that's coming along.
[07:40.200 --> 07:44.160]  I mean, this is a very well laid out plan.
[07:44.160 --> 07:49.000]  They've been planning this, wargaming this for over 20 years.
[07:49.000 --> 07:57.200]  They had created the Model State Emergency Health Powers Act prior, just prior to 9-11,
[07:57.200 --> 08:00.600]  and then they pushed it out to all of the different states and said, hey, you've got
[08:00.600 --> 08:02.880]  to get your, rush this through.
[08:02.880 --> 08:04.600]  Here's the model legislation.
[08:04.600 --> 08:08.680]  Give special powers to all your public health agencies so they can shut down everything
[08:08.680 --> 08:13.120]  in case there's a terrorist attack, you know, with anthrax or something like that.
[08:13.120 --> 08:16.000]  And so they've been preparing this for a very long time.
[08:16.000 --> 08:20.600]  Annual simulations, not just the Event 201 simulation, but annual simulations, wargaming
[08:20.600 --> 08:26.600]  this in order to prepare, mentally prepare and psychologically prepare the people who
[08:26.600 --> 08:29.480]  were going to go along with this at the highest levels.
[08:29.480 --> 08:33.680]  They have been prepared for this for 20-some-odd simulations.
[08:33.680 --> 08:35.760]  First one was Dark Winter.
[08:35.760 --> 08:38.760]  There was a lot of news about that Dark Winter too a couple of years ago.
[08:38.760 --> 08:41.960]  Well, we're in the middle of Dark Winter too.
[08:41.960 --> 08:48.360]  But before we get into that, I want to talk about John Bolton and this book.
[08:48.360 --> 08:54.600]  And you know, the last, we will talk about some of the charges back and forth.
[08:54.600 --> 08:59.800]  I don't put too much credibility in any of these charges going back and forth.
[08:59.800 --> 09:07.360]  John Bolton has essentially reduced himself to just another orange man bad, backbiting,
[09:07.360 --> 09:09.280]  backstabbing, gossiper in Washington.
[09:09.280 --> 09:11.280]  And we got a lot of those people in Washington.
[09:11.280 --> 09:16.320]  I don't think we need to spend a whole lot of time on all the slurs and the slander going
[09:16.320 --> 09:21.200]  back and forth from President Trump to Bolton or vice versa.
[09:21.200 --> 09:27.520]  But the bigger question is, what is going on in terms of our foreign policy?
[09:27.520 --> 09:31.280]  How does somebody like Bolton actually get hired in the first place?
[09:31.280 --> 09:36.360]  And this goes back to right after the election.
[09:36.360 --> 09:44.040]  John Bolton's name has been thrown up by the neocons from the very beginning.
[09:44.040 --> 09:48.040]  Right after the election, Rand Paul went on with Chris Matthews.
[09:48.040 --> 09:53.640]  It'd be interesting to see what Chris Matthews would have said because he was very much against
[09:53.640 --> 09:54.880]  John Bolton at the time.
[09:54.880 --> 09:59.400]  I would imagine today, Chris Matthews, if he was on air would be, oh, we've got to
[09:59.400 --> 10:01.240]  believe everything that John Bolton says.
[10:01.240 --> 10:07.560]  He thought he was a deranged lunatic who was trying to start World War III and he was pretty
[10:07.560 --> 10:08.760]  much right.
[10:08.760 --> 10:13.400]  Rand Paul said at the time, this is December 2016.
[10:13.400 --> 10:15.560]  I want to play a clip for you.
[10:15.560 --> 10:19.040]  Going back and forth, this is Chris Matthews and Rand Paul.
[10:19.040 --> 10:24.280]  In the context, they began by talking about Rex Tillerson, another very bad pick by President
[10:24.280 --> 10:26.440]  Trump, which I criticized in the very beginning.
[10:26.440 --> 10:31.280]  I said, this guy is full on and he's going to push everything about the environmentalist
[10:31.280 --> 10:37.040]  agenda, besides the fact of what he had done for the LGBT movement turning the Boy Scouts
[10:37.040 --> 10:38.480]  gay when he was there.
[10:38.480 --> 10:44.000]  But he was going to be somebody who wound up opposing President Trump on the Paris climate
[10:44.000 --> 10:45.640]  accord and other issues.
[10:45.640 --> 10:49.560]  They began talking briefly about him and then they spent most of their time, however, talking
[10:49.560 --> 10:52.800]  about John Bolton, because there was a lot of rumors that Bolton was going to be one
[10:52.800 --> 10:55.320]  of the first picks for President Trump.
[10:55.320 --> 10:57.720]  Here's that clip from December 2016.
[10:57.720 --> 11:00.800]  It's skiing and fishing with Putin.
[11:00.800 --> 11:02.080]  They got some awards.
[11:02.080 --> 11:04.800]  Let's hear at least a little bit about what his worldview is.
[11:04.800 --> 11:08.400]  Does he believe in intervention, ad nauseam in the Middle East?
[11:08.400 --> 11:12.000]  Does he believe in regime change, nation building?
[11:12.000 --> 11:15.640]  Some of the things that I've been encouraged about Donald Trump, we haven't agreed on some
[11:15.640 --> 11:19.680]  things, but I have been encouraged that he thinks that regime change in the Middle East
[11:19.680 --> 11:24.480]  hasn't made us safer or more secure, that he hasn't been for nation building, regime
[11:24.480 --> 11:25.480]  change.
[11:25.480 --> 11:30.040]  I honestly believe he's learned the lesson that the Iraq War didn't help us as a country.
[11:30.040 --> 11:33.600]  Well, I know he hasn't learned his lesson because it's who he is essentially, and that's
[11:33.600 --> 11:34.760]  John Bolton.
[11:34.760 --> 11:36.520]  That guy won't quit.
[11:36.520 --> 11:41.960]  His desire for power and the weedle his way into every Republican administration is relentless
[11:41.960 --> 11:43.840]  the neocon network helps him.
[11:43.840 --> 11:44.840]  Here he is.
[11:44.840 --> 11:48.280]  John Bolton, the man NBC reports is being, I love this phrase, I actually hate it, eyed
[11:48.280 --> 11:51.720]  for deputy secretary of state has advocated for bombing Iran.
[11:51.720 --> 11:53.040]  Here he was just last year.
[11:53.040 --> 11:54.560]  This is Bolton.
[11:54.560 --> 11:59.480]  Just as Israel twice before has struck nuclear weapons programs in the hands of hostile states,
[11:59.480 --> 12:04.240]  I'm afraid given the circumstances, that's the only real option open to us now.
[12:04.240 --> 12:05.240]  Right now?
[12:05.240 --> 12:06.240]  Or are you saying leading into the future?
[12:06.240 --> 12:09.760]  No, I would have done this five or six years ago because the earlier you strike, the more
[12:09.760 --> 12:10.760]  damage you can do.
[12:10.760 --> 12:13.000]  Oh my God, Bolton on Fox, unbelievable combination.
[12:13.000 --> 12:14.000]  That was a strong booster.
[12:14.000 --> 12:18.560]  Of course, he was of the Iraq invasion still is in 2002, Bolton peddled bad information
[12:18.560 --> 12:20.160]  about that country's weapons program.
[12:20.160 --> 12:23.840]  Quote, we are confident, he said at the time, that Saddam Hussein has hidden weapons of
[12:23.840 --> 12:26.360]  best destruction and production facilities in Iraq.
[12:26.360 --> 12:28.840]  Well, last May, Bolton continued to defend the invasion.
[12:28.840 --> 12:33.240]  That's last month, telling the Washington Examiner, I still think the decision to overthrow
[12:33.240 --> 12:34.240]  Saddam was correct.
[12:34.240 --> 12:36.240]  I love the way it's so prissy, correct.
[12:36.240 --> 12:38.240]  He echoed that sentiment as recently as yesterday.
[12:38.240 --> 12:39.440]  Here we go.
[12:39.440 --> 12:42.680]  I was a member of George W. Bush's administration.
[12:42.680 --> 12:44.040]  He supported the Iraq war.
[12:44.040 --> 12:45.560]  Of course, I supported the Iraq war.
[12:45.560 --> 12:50.200]  I've written on the subject, some people would probably say endlessly about what the lessons
[12:50.200 --> 12:51.600]  are to be learned from it.
[12:51.600 --> 12:55.520]  I've put it out on the record, I've never hidden my views from anybody, and I absolutely
[12:55.520 --> 12:56.760]  don't back away from them.
[12:56.760 --> 13:00.640]  Senator Paul, isn't it interesting the ones who backed the Iraq war, also back going into
[13:00.640 --> 13:04.720]  Libya, also back going into Syria, and they always have one like a little Pez dispenser,
[13:04.720 --> 13:05.720]  a little Kennedy dispenser.
[13:05.720 --> 13:07.440]  They always had the next war they wanted us to fight.
[13:07.440 --> 13:09.920]  There's always one, they pushed about another war comes out.
[13:09.920 --> 13:12.880]  They always want a new war in Bolton's classic.
[13:12.880 --> 13:13.880]  Your thoughts?
[13:13.880 --> 13:15.880]  Will you be able to stop this guy if he gets in the door?
[13:15.880 --> 13:19.040]  Well, this is why learning the historical lessons are important.
[13:19.040 --> 13:23.680]  This isn't the Iraq war from 15 years ago or 14 years ago that we're concerned about.
[13:23.680 --> 13:27.240]  We're worried about whether or not he learned the lesson from that war, but he didn't.
[13:27.240 --> 13:32.800]  He advocated for regime change in Libya, turned into chaos, and ISIS actually became strengthened,
[13:32.800 --> 13:37.120]  and I think we're more at risk now for terrorist attack from Libya than we were before the war.
[13:37.120 --> 13:40.600]  He's also advocated for regime change in Syria.
[13:40.600 --> 13:45.360]  And as bad a guy as Assad is, I don't know that that's helped us because I think it actually
[13:45.360 --> 13:49.000]  has created a power vacuum where ISIS has filled that vacuum.
[13:49.000 --> 13:53.600]  But even more so, advocating for regime change in Iran is a real problem because it shows
[13:53.600 --> 13:57.440]  this naive understanding of the world that he thinks, oh, everything's going to be great.
[13:57.440 --> 13:58.960]  We're going to drop a few bombs.
[13:58.960 --> 14:00.280]  They'll have a new government there.
[14:00.280 --> 14:04.000]  Thomas Jefferson will be elected, and there'll be no more problems in Iran.
[14:04.000 --> 14:08.600]  But it didn't work out that way in Iraq, and I think Iran's a bigger, much stronger country
[14:08.600 --> 14:10.560]  than Iraq ever was.
[14:10.560 --> 14:15.040]  And I don't think he's learned any of the lessons of the Iraq war, and he wants to reinstitute
[14:15.040 --> 14:16.280]  a new war in Iran.
[14:16.280 --> 14:20.200]  So, no, I think this person, John Bolton, should never have any position in the State
[14:20.200 --> 14:21.200]  Department.
[14:21.200 --> 14:24.800]  I will vote no, and I hope my vote will be the deciding vote to keep him out of the State
[14:24.800 --> 14:25.800]  Department.
[14:25.800 --> 14:26.800]  All right.
[14:26.800 --> 14:30.080]  And so John Bolton did not get into the State Department, not at that time.
[14:30.080 --> 14:34.000]  He eventually came in as a national security advisor.
[14:34.000 --> 14:38.360]  But we had Michael Flynn was put in.
[14:38.360 --> 14:41.720]  Unfortunately, President Trump did make the mistake of putting in Rex Tillerson, and he
[14:41.720 --> 14:46.760]  made the mistake of not standing by Michael Flynn as the neocons set him up.
[14:46.760 --> 14:54.800]  I mean, you look at how long this has gone on, how much corruption has been exposed as
[14:54.800 --> 15:01.480]  they did everything they could to entrap General Flynn, because they could not have somebody
[15:01.480 --> 15:05.040]  who told us the truth about what was going on in Syria, told us the truth that there
[15:05.040 --> 15:09.880]  were elements of the U.S. government that were arming ISIS and so forth.
[15:09.880 --> 15:12.320]  They had to get him out of there immediately.
[15:12.320 --> 15:18.080]  And so we go to February 2017, after they had engineered the removal of General Flynn.
[15:18.080 --> 15:23.000]  And again, Rand Paul, the adviser to President Trump, do not hire John Bolton as national
[15:23.000 --> 15:25.720]  security adviser.
[15:25.720 --> 15:29.480]  Instead they hired McMaster at that time.
[15:29.480 --> 15:33.840]  And they had multiple people that were being looked at.
[15:33.840 --> 15:38.840]  Fortunately, President Trump didn't go with a portray us either, but McMaster was also
[15:38.840 --> 15:41.280]  a very bad neocon pick.
[15:41.280 --> 15:44.880]  They engineered to get Flynn out to put McMaster in.
[15:44.880 --> 15:49.440]  We're going to talk more about Bolton's background, and we're going to talk more a little bit
[15:49.440 --> 15:56.120]  about the devil on President Trump's shoulder, Lindsey Graham, pushing John Bolton.
[15:56.120 --> 15:57.120]  We'll be right back.
[15:57.120 --> 15:58.120]  Stay with us.
[15:58.120 --> 15:59.960]  I'm always excited about InfoWars live products.
[15:59.960 --> 16:00.960]  They're amazing.
[16:00.960 --> 16:01.960]  They're cutting edge.
[16:01.960 --> 16:02.960]  You love them.
[16:02.960 --> 16:03.960]  I love them.
[16:03.960 --> 16:06.000]  And they find the InfoWars in the face of the globalist onslaught.
[16:06.000 --> 16:12.600]  But we have come up with a new product over a year in development that is amazing.
[16:12.600 --> 16:20.360]  The only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it.
[16:20.360 --> 16:22.680]  And there's another innovation.
[16:22.680 --> 16:24.680]  It's the spray cap.
[16:24.680 --> 16:30.080]  It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross, goo, but it's high quality.
[16:30.080 --> 16:32.240]  It aerosolizes it in a really great way.
[16:32.240 --> 16:35.480]  I like to put it on my hands, rub a little bit on my face.
[16:35.480 --> 16:38.080]  It's got organic alcohol in it, so spray it around your eyes.
[16:38.080 --> 16:42.480]  But I just love it personally as something that's a moisturizer as well.
[16:42.480 --> 16:44.400]  So this is a real innovation.
[16:44.400 --> 16:48.480]  I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has
[16:48.480 --> 16:52.360]  essential oil in it so it doesn't dry you out and smells great.
[16:52.360 --> 16:54.240]  It's so refreshing.
[16:54.240 --> 16:57.960]  This is a big winner.
[16:57.960 --> 17:06.520]  It's finally here, introducing the new Survival Shield X2 Spray, available now for 33% off
[17:06.520 --> 17:10.480]  at InfoWarsStore.com.
[17:10.480 --> 17:17.280]  Others have been asking us for months to develop an iodine spray made with our exclusive deep

[17:20.280 --> 17:27.520]  Our proprietary new aerodyne technology allows us to harness the full power of ancient iodine

[18:00.520 --> 18:10.520]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:10.520 --> 18:24.840]  All right, welcome back.
[18:24.840 --> 18:30.640]  Over this last weekend on Saturday, President Trump addressed the West Point graduating
[18:30.640 --> 18:31.640]  class.
[18:31.640 --> 18:36.880]  He said, your job is going to be to defend America's vital interests, not to fight endless
[18:36.880 --> 18:39.680]  wars and faraway lands.
[18:39.680 --> 18:43.320]  That is not what the people in the Pentagon want to hear, what the military industrial
[18:43.320 --> 18:44.560]  complex wants to hear.
[18:44.560 --> 18:50.840]  People like James Bolton, people like James Mattis, people like David Petraeus, all of
[18:50.840 --> 18:52.920]  these people, McMaster, so forth.
[18:52.920 --> 18:58.880]  And, of course, President Trump plans to withdraw 9,500 troops from Germany.
[18:58.880 --> 19:01.240]  He's going to relocate them to Poland.
[19:01.240 --> 19:02.560]  The German officials are very mad.
[19:02.560 --> 19:10.240]  I mean, they're as mad as, you know, the governor of a southern state with a base named
[19:10.240 --> 19:12.840]  after a Confederate general would be if they just shut down that base.
[19:12.840 --> 19:14.280]  I don't want to shut down any bases.
[19:14.280 --> 19:15.680]  I mean, this is not about defense.
[19:15.680 --> 19:19.240]  This is about welfare.
[19:19.240 --> 19:28.480]  And you have people like Mark Milley, U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff chair that has been
[19:28.480 --> 19:34.600]  criticizing President Trump after the walk to the church.
[19:34.600 --> 19:39.480]  You had Defense Secretary Mark Esper criticizing President Trump.
[19:39.480 --> 19:44.880]  You had 22 Republicans on the U.S. House of Representatives Armed Services Committee wrote
[19:44.880 --> 19:50.240]  to Trump saying a troop cut in Germany would hurt national security and could encourage
[19:50.240 --> 19:51.240]  Russian aggression.
[19:51.240 --> 19:57.640]  How would that be when you got the troops closer to Russia and Poland?
[19:57.640 --> 20:02.720]  Because, you know, when we put the bases there in Germany, if you remember, the Soviet Union
[20:02.720 --> 20:03.720]  was there.
[20:03.720 --> 20:09.760]  And the Soviet Union had control of Poland, so it couldn't put any forces in Poland.
[20:09.760 --> 20:13.000]  It might explain that to the Republicans.
[20:13.000 --> 20:14.200]  Why is President Trump doing this?
[20:14.200 --> 20:20.160]  Why is he offending the military industrial complex and these neocon establishment Republicans?
[20:20.160 --> 20:25.200]  Twenty-two of them with this Armed Services Committee.
[20:25.200 --> 20:30.080]  Well, because it's election time, quite frankly, and the American people don't want this.
[20:30.080 --> 20:33.280]  candidate Trump did not want this.
[20:33.280 --> 20:36.280]  And he is standing for election.
[20:36.280 --> 20:40.680]  The Republicans really don't care for the most part.
[20:40.680 --> 20:45.360]  And as I said, we've got we go back and we look at how Bolton got in here, always the
[20:45.360 --> 20:49.560]  darling of the neocons and the Republicans who want war.
[20:49.560 --> 20:54.960]  And you just need to ask yourself, why is it that Republicans were talking about prosperity?
[20:54.960 --> 20:58.760]  That's the only they they don't care about liberty.
[20:58.760 --> 21:01.720]  The Democrats don't care about liberty.
[21:01.720 --> 21:03.320]  The Democrats, they want money.
[21:03.320 --> 21:05.360]  They want money as far as welfare goes.
[21:05.360 --> 21:10.600]  The Republicans want money in terms of jobs and an opportunity to that that type of thing.
[21:10.600 --> 21:16.760]  They all want safety and security, but they don't care about liberty.
[21:16.760 --> 21:20.520]  But you know, the reality is, is that if you don't make that the first priority, you don't
[21:20.520 --> 21:22.000]  get any of those other things.
[21:22.000 --> 21:24.840]  You don't get a good economy.
[21:24.840 --> 21:31.160]  You don't have a country that can afford to pay you your universal basic income or your
[21:31.160 --> 21:36.360]  welfare because you've shut down the economy and the biggest destroyer of wealth, which
[21:36.360 --> 21:41.360]  is really where this the Republicans have this fundamental conflict.
[21:41.360 --> 21:47.760]  They want to talk about prosperity, and yet they want to do the very thing that destroys
[21:47.760 --> 21:50.560]  our economy more than anything.
[21:50.560 --> 21:53.920]  And that is war everywhere.
[21:53.920 --> 21:55.280]  You want to get poor fast?
[21:55.280 --> 21:56.280]  Have a war.
[21:56.280 --> 21:59.480]  Now, some of these people are saying, well, you know, it's kind of good, though.
[21:59.480 --> 22:00.480]  We got these.
[22:00.480 --> 22:04.040]  You got some Democrats saying, they burned down these buildings that'll create some jobs
[22:04.040 --> 22:07.600]  for us to go back and break the broken window fallacy.
[22:07.600 --> 22:08.720]  That's a bunch of nonsense.
[22:08.720 --> 22:14.800]  But still, you have these neocons in the Republican Party, and that wing is really represented
[22:14.800 --> 22:21.280]  now that John McCain has left by John McCain's evil twin, Lindsey Graham, who, as I pointed
[22:21.280 --> 22:26.600]  out, you know, you have Rand Paul in December 2016, as people were talking about Trump putting
[22:26.600 --> 22:28.760]  John Bolton in his administration.
[22:28.760 --> 22:32.840]  He and Chris Matthews, you heard that clip saying this guy is a lunatic.
[22:32.840 --> 22:40.560]  He proudly calls for bombing Iran, and we've got to keep him out of there.
[22:40.560 --> 22:45.400]  And within a month, they had engineered the removal of General Flynn.
[22:45.400 --> 22:52.920]  They had put in McMaster, or about to put in McMaster, when Rand Paul said, hey, we've
[22:52.920 --> 22:53.920]  got to.
[22:53.920 --> 22:59.840]  And of course, at that time, David Petraeus is also being considered, evidently, whether
[22:59.840 --> 23:04.680]  he was being considered or whether he was just being given a courtesy call so that President
[23:04.680 --> 23:07.600]  Trump could find out what he was about, who knows.
[23:07.600 --> 23:12.520]  But based on some of the picks that President Trump's administration has put in there, perhaps
[23:12.520 --> 23:15.520]  they were considering David Petraeus.
[23:15.520 --> 23:20.560]  But in an interview, as they were looking for the replacement for General Flynn, that
[23:20.560 --> 23:26.600]  they had falsely accused and who has been persecuted now for years, what a travesty
[23:26.600 --> 23:27.600]  that is.
[23:27.600 --> 23:31.120]  In an interview, Rand Paul said that Bolton would push a foreign policy closer to that
[23:31.120 --> 23:32.880]  of Senator John McCain.
[23:32.880 --> 23:35.960]  He said, John Bolton still believes the Iraq war was a good idea.
[23:35.960 --> 23:38.080]  He still believes regime change is a good idea.
[23:38.080 --> 23:40.960]  He still believes that nation building is a good idea.
[23:40.960 --> 23:47.280]  My fear is that a secret war, and many secret wars to be developing around the globe, I
[23:47.280 --> 23:48.440]  think he would be a bad choice.
[23:48.440 --> 23:53.360]  Well, it turns out the secret war was the one against President Trump when he finally
[23:53.360 --> 23:55.600]  got in there.
[23:55.600 --> 23:59.520]  So Rand Paul was the, you know, we talked about the meme of the good and the bad angels,
[23:59.520 --> 24:02.200]  kind of naive when you think about it from a spiritual warfare thing.
[24:02.200 --> 24:05.480]  But I think it's a pretty good meme for what's going on with the military industrial complex
[24:05.480 --> 24:08.600]  and what's going on in Washington and the Trump administration.
[24:08.600 --> 24:13.840]  Lindsey Graham, however, the evil guy, the devil setting on President Trump's shoulder,
[24:13.840 --> 24:17.680]  because the two of them have put themselves very close to President Trump.
[24:17.680 --> 24:25.720]  Lindsey Graham green-lighted President Trump's appointment of John Bolton after H.R. McMaster left.
[24:25.720 --> 24:27.080]  He said, Bolton has a world view.
[24:27.080 --> 24:28.080]  This is Graham.
[24:28.080 --> 24:32.000]  Bolton has a world view that I think will help the president and make us safer, he said
[24:32.000 --> 24:34.360]  in March of 2018.
[24:34.360 --> 24:38.520]  Lindsey Graham said, Bolton believes the Iranian agreement is a terrible deal for the world,
[24:38.520 --> 24:40.720]  the U.S. and Israel.
[24:40.720 --> 24:44.240]  He believes in a strong military going after terrorists, taking the gloves off.
[24:44.240 --> 24:47.680]  He's a diplomat, but he understands that if you're going to deal with thugs like the Ayatollah
[24:47.680 --> 24:50.640]  and Iran, you've got to be taken seriously.
[24:50.640 --> 24:53.200]  So you're going to drop a few bombs before you start talking.
[24:53.200 --> 24:56.280]  The era of leading from behind is over.
[24:56.280 --> 24:59.080]  John Bolton is leading from the front, kind of guy.
[24:59.080 --> 25:03.520]  Well, it turns out he's kind of a backstabber, I think.
[25:03.520 --> 25:07.120]  Taking notes in all the meetings, everybody said, you know, every meeting he was going
[25:07.120 --> 25:08.280]  to, he's taking copious notes.
[25:08.280 --> 25:13.200]  I mean, he was there as an undercover guy for the neocons from the very beginning.
[25:13.200 --> 25:17.440]  And then praise Trump and called him one hell of a good commander-in-chief and called Bolton
[25:17.440 --> 25:19.560]  the right man at the right time.
[25:19.560 --> 25:22.000]  Well, you know, who is this guy, John Bolton?
[25:22.000 --> 25:23.000]  He's got a long history.
[25:23.000 --> 25:28.360]  If you go back and look at it, this is a guy who was George W. Bush's ambassador to the
[25:28.360 --> 25:35.680]  U.N. He'd had stints and things like the U.S. agency for international development.
[25:35.680 --> 25:40.800]  You know, USAID is a CIA front operation, so he had his little CIA connections there.
[25:40.800 --> 25:44.400]  Prior to that, he had been a summer intern for Sparrow Agnew.
[25:44.400 --> 25:50.880]  Maybe he helped Sparrow Agnew to stuff the cash in his suitcases there at the White House.
[25:50.880 --> 25:55.720]  He also had drawn a low draft number in the Vietnam War, and so he joined the National
[25:55.720 --> 26:01.080]  Guard and he said, I confess, I had no desire to die in a rice paddy in Vietnam.
[26:01.080 --> 26:07.080]  Oh, but he'll send your sons and daughters to die in the desert or maybe a rice paddy,
[26:07.080 --> 26:08.080]  wherever.
[26:08.080 --> 26:09.080]  I mean, you know, everywhere.
[26:09.080 --> 26:15.240]  Yes, no, this is typical of these guys, these chicken hawks, who push war everywhere.
[26:15.240 --> 26:17.520]  They won't fight it themselves.
[26:17.520 --> 26:21.120]  They'll do everything they can to stay out of the conflict themselves.
[26:21.120 --> 26:27.480]  That's the kind of vile person that is always pushing other people over the cliff to their
[26:27.480 --> 26:28.480]  death.
[26:28.480 --> 26:32.440]  As I think about this, Chinese versus Indian War, that's an amazing story.
[26:32.440 --> 26:35.600]  We'll talk a little bit about that coming up, but of course, he was also there with
[26:35.600 --> 26:36.600]  Iran Contra.
[26:36.600 --> 26:39.360]  He was there with the drug war.
[26:39.360 --> 26:42.680]  It's kind of the forest gump of the neocons.
[26:42.680 --> 26:44.360]  John Bolton, we'll be right back.
[26:44.360 --> 26:55.280]  Stay with us.
[26:55.280 --> 26:57.800]  I was talking to my Patriot supplier and great suppliers.
[26:57.800 --> 27:00.760]  You can now say four weeks on average for storable food.
[27:00.760 --> 27:03.280]  It's the highest quality they've got it.
[27:03.280 --> 27:07.160]  There's this little rest we have caught in the current to come up to the surface, get
[27:07.160 --> 27:09.480]  some air before you get sucked back down.
[27:09.480 --> 27:12.000]  I personally am ordering more storable food.
[27:12.000 --> 27:18.480]  I have to now start going into defense posture, 80% offense, but I've always been 100% offense,
[27:18.480 --> 27:21.920]  trying to fully, you know, stop the globalists and we've given them a good run.
[27:21.920 --> 27:26.200]  And I think down the road, they'll be defeated, but we're going to still go down the hard
[27:26.200 --> 27:27.200]  road now.
[27:27.200 --> 27:31.880]  There were a lot worse roads, we'd probably go down, but we've mitigated some of this,
[27:31.880 --> 27:33.600]  but it's still going to be bad in my view.
[27:33.600 --> 27:35.080]  You need to get high quality storeable food.
[27:35.080 --> 27:36.280]  It's something you need.
[27:36.280 --> 27:40.240]  We have high quality ready to get out to you and it supports the broadcast and 360 wins.
[27:40.240 --> 27:45.000]  So please take care of your storeable foods needs at infowarstore.com and get your orders
[27:45.000 --> 27:46.000]  in now.
[27:46.000 --> 27:47.000]  So you get it.
[27:47.000 --> 27:48.000]  So you have it.
[27:48.000 --> 27:49.000]  It's in great containers.
[27:49.000 --> 27:50.000]  High quality.
[27:50.000 --> 27:51.000]  Last 25 years.
[27:51.000 --> 27:53.520]  Get it while you can because if you think things are about to let up, you ain't seen
[27:53.520 --> 27:54.520]  nothing yet.
[27:54.520 --> 27:58.360]  When it comes to regaining energy during the day, convenience is key.
[27:58.360 --> 28:02.520]  Energy and energy drinks provide a short boost, but the crash always follows.
[28:02.520 --> 28:07.440]  That's why we created a mixable energy formula to take on the go, Turboforce.
[28:07.440 --> 28:12.240]  Turboforce from InfoWars Life utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used across the
[28:12.240 --> 28:16.640]  globe to provide focus, clarity, and a boost of energy when you need it.
[28:16.640 --> 28:20.680]  Turboforce is a force to be reckoned with for portable, affordable, and tasty energy.
[28:20.680 --> 28:25.080]  Try adding this to your daily routine and revolutionize your day today.
[28:25.080 --> 28:28.720]  It's time to take a new healthier approach to one of your most basic needs.
[28:28.720 --> 28:32.640]  The Alexa Pure Pro water filtration system is the same water filter that Alex and the
[28:32.640 --> 28:35.800]  InfoWars crew use every day for the purest water possible.
[28:35.800 --> 28:39.120]  You can start cleaning the toxins from your water for clean, healthy, and delicious drinking
[28:39.120 --> 28:40.120]  water.
[28:40.120 --> 28:43.400]  Perfect for preppers or anyone concerned with the healthier source of water, the Alexa Pure
[28:43.400 --> 28:46.800]  Pro can remove up to 99.9% of impurities.
[28:46.800 --> 28:51.000]  This ground-breaking, gravity-fed water filtration system is like no other.
[28:51.000 --> 28:54.560]  Make sure your water is up to your standards today with the Alexa Pure Pro.
[28:54.560 --> 28:58.640]  Aerodyne Technology Delivery System.
[28:58.640 --> 29:04.440]  The first of its kind, pure, nascent, atomic iodine that can be delivered through a spray
[29:04.440 --> 29:05.440]  bottle.
[29:05.440 --> 29:11.280]  The next level of innovation of X2 is here, introducing Survival Shield X2 Spray.
[29:11.280 --> 29:14.400]  The great part about the X2 spray is it's great on the go.
[29:14.400 --> 29:18.560]  When you've got it in the dropper, it's great at your house, it's great at work, but this
[29:18.560 --> 29:23.080]  is great for the car, it's great to keep with you, and again, it's also good for the
[29:23.080 --> 29:27.800]  throat and mouth to get the effects of iodine, not to just ingest it into the stomach.
[29:27.800 --> 29:31.640]  And we're really excited about it, it's 33% off out of the gates.
[29:31.640 --> 29:36.080]  It was listeners' idea asking for us to come up with a spray bottle that had us talk to
[29:36.080 --> 29:40.160]  the scientists and developers and come up with a system that aerosolizes it and delivers
[29:40.160 --> 29:43.680]  it to the body in a new and in some ways, even better way.
[29:43.680 --> 29:49.840]  Get your Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine spray now at 33% off at infowarstore.com and
[29:49.840 --> 29:58.240]  experience the power of aerosolized X2 nascent iodine for yourself.
[29:58.240 --> 30:19.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:19.800 --> 30:26.920]  Alright things are getting close, it's 13 days before Roger Stone gets sent to prison,
[30:26.920 --> 30:31.000]  which is going to be a death sentence at his age, of course.
[30:31.000 --> 30:35.200]  And President Trump, as much as he has tied up in these other things, I mean look at what
[30:35.200 --> 30:36.600]  has happened with General Flynn.
[30:36.600 --> 30:37.760]  Why do we have a Bolton?
[30:37.760 --> 30:41.680]  Well, it's because they were able to engineer the removal of General Flynn and persecute
[30:41.680 --> 30:45.000]  him for two years, and of course, Roger Stone as well.
[30:45.000 --> 30:48.880]  President Trump must step in in these cases.
[30:48.880 --> 30:53.360]  People are watching very closely President Trump.
[30:53.360 --> 30:56.560]  Roger Stone is 67, they're going to send him to prison under these circumstances at
[30:56.560 --> 30:57.560]  the same time.
[30:57.560 --> 31:03.880]  They're letting people out everywhere, convicted violent criminals, because you know, COVID-19
[31:03.880 --> 31:06.040]  let all these people out.
[31:06.040 --> 31:10.280]  And you're going to stand there while Roger Stone is sent to prison.
[31:10.280 --> 31:16.760]  It's just absolutely amazing to see this, but President Trump needs to intervene.
[31:16.760 --> 31:19.840]  He has, he could do the right thing.
[31:19.840 --> 31:24.320]  These people, his base wants to see it, these people who are criticizing him with the Bolton
[31:24.320 --> 31:26.920]  book, they're going to criticize him no matter what.
[31:26.920 --> 31:31.360]  He needs to show that he has some character and some backbone, and that he stands by
[31:31.360 --> 31:35.440]  principles and by people who have been loyal to him.
[31:35.440 --> 31:41.880]  How many times is he going to pick somebody like a Bolton, or a Tillerson, or McMaster,
[31:41.880 --> 31:47.320]  or Mattis, or these other people who are now Defense Secretary and others who are stabbing
[31:47.320 --> 31:49.760]  him in the back?
[31:49.760 --> 31:54.520]  If you're going to, you know, personnel is policy, and if you don't have people who support
[31:54.520 --> 31:59.880]  your policy, if you put in people who support exactly the opposite, that's exactly what
[31:59.880 --> 32:02.440]  we've seen now for the last four years.
[32:02.440 --> 32:12.520]  Going back to John Bolton, again, when, before he was removed, just before he was removed,
[32:12.520 --> 32:18.400]  Rand Paul, who had cautioned against putting him in, before President Trump began his administration,
[32:18.400 --> 32:25.240]  who was talked about, he was talked about again, as H.R. McMaster was put in the place
[32:25.240 --> 32:30.680]  of General Flynn, Rand Paul was saying, don't do it, don't do it, no Instagram is saying,
[32:30.680 --> 32:33.480]  do it, do it, he's great, he's great.
[32:33.480 --> 32:37.360]  And then, of course, he did get the job after H.R. McMaster, and Rand Paul said, in May
[32:37.360 --> 32:44.960]  2019, Bolton is a malign influence, that's reported by the Hill at the time, Paul, who
[32:44.960 --> 32:49.000]  believes the U.S. should reduce its military presence in Syria, and Afghanistan says he
[32:49.000 --> 32:53.480]  has alarmed by the recent mobilization of U.S. combat troops to counter what some Trump
[32:53.480 --> 32:58.480]  officials see as a rising threat posed by Iran.
[32:58.480 --> 33:04.320]  And again, this is the point in time where the U.S. was maneuvering, Bolton and Pompeo
[33:04.320 --> 33:12.200]  were maneuvering to try to get us into trying to provoke Iran, or hoping that they crammed
[33:12.200 --> 33:17.280]  enough ships into the Strait of Hormuz, there would be some kind of an incident that we
[33:17.280 --> 33:23.040]  could interpret, like we did the Gulf of Tonkin incident, interpret that as an attack and start
[33:23.040 --> 33:24.040]  a war.
[33:24.040 --> 33:29.360]  A war which, as I pointed out, John Bolton decided that he didn't want to fight in, asked
[33:29.360 --> 33:33.280]  about Bolton's role in the recent development of an aircraft carrier strike group, and an
[33:33.280 --> 33:38.440]  Air Force bomber task force, Rand Paul said, I fear that he is a malignancy, yes, he is
[33:38.440 --> 33:40.080]  a cancer.
[33:40.080 --> 33:46.400]  The entire military industrial complex, neocons that he represents, are a malignancy, a malignant
[33:46.400 --> 33:47.400]  cancer.
[33:47.400 --> 33:53.120]  He is a malignancy, a malignant influence on the administration.
[33:53.120 --> 33:56.320]  Paul believes that Bolton is in a camp of hawks who may be pushing Trump in the direction
[33:56.320 --> 33:57.320]  of war.
[33:57.320 --> 34:01.920]  The question is that it's being done in reaction to our increased presence there, and our naming
[34:01.920 --> 34:07.120]  of all the revolutionary guards as terrorists, is this a reason to our policy, or is it simply
[34:07.120 --> 34:10.680]  an aggressive policy, saying that we're going to start a war?
[34:10.680 --> 34:16.880]  Iran knows you don't start a war with the United States, but of course Bolton always
[34:16.880 --> 34:18.760]  wanted to.
[34:18.760 --> 34:25.960]  And his ally in that was John McCain, and his ally Lindsey Graham, and after McCain
[34:25.960 --> 34:31.720]  was gone, it was Lindsey Graham, and at the time, there was an interesting article written
[34:31.720 --> 34:39.640]  by Yahoo, it's finance news, Lindsey Graham has two sources of power, they said, his gavel
[34:39.640 --> 34:44.120]  and his golf clubs, well, no, that's not his two sources of power.
[34:44.120 --> 34:48.600]  Lindsey Graham's two sources of power are the Judiciary Committee and the Foreign Relations
[34:48.600 --> 34:56.760]  Committee, and see, he wants to put his foreign relations committee and his credentials as
[34:56.760 --> 35:04.680]  a neocon warhawk, doing whatever Israel wants, whatever the military industrial complex wants.
[35:04.680 --> 35:11.320]  That is his key to power, but his gavel that he was able to use against President Trump
[35:11.320 --> 35:18.040]  also was his ability, his position on the Judiciary Committee, and the claims that they
[35:18.040 --> 35:20.420]  brought against President Trump for impeachment.
[35:20.420 --> 35:26.000]  Those were the two sources of Lindsey Graham's power and his pressure.
[35:26.000 --> 35:29.600]  He said, hey, he needs to do the right thing and not pull these troops back, because if
[35:29.600 --> 35:33.560]  he does, I'm going to be his worst enemy, because he was sitting there on the Judiciary
[35:33.560 --> 35:38.480]  Committee that was going to set on the impeachment stuff, and they created those charges out
[35:38.480 --> 35:39.480]  of nothing.
[35:39.480 --> 35:44.960]  Some of his friends that they talked about in this Yahoo article, Robert Menendez, remember
[35:44.960 --> 35:52.960]  when Menendez was caught in a cut and dry case of corruption, he should have been removed
[35:52.960 --> 35:57.640]  from office, sent to prison, the Democrat from New Jersey, and he was Lindsey's buddy
[35:57.640 --> 36:02.520]  because both of them are neocons, and Lindsey Graham testified on his behalf, did everything
[36:02.520 --> 36:10.440]  he could to make sure that his buddy, also the top Democrat, the top Democrat, top Republicans
[36:10.440 --> 36:16.160]  on the Foreign Relations Committee, make sure that they want to shake up that neocon lock
[36:16.160 --> 36:18.160]  on foreign relations.
[36:18.160 --> 36:21.880]  So Menendez says, you know, with Lindsey, it's a mixed bad, obviously to the extent
[36:21.880 --> 36:26.060]  that he can get the president's ear, you know, sitting on his shoulder as a devil, trying
[36:26.060 --> 36:30.360]  to affect his thinking on something that I would agree with on, well, that's a good thing.
[36:30.360 --> 36:32.880]  That's a good thing.
[36:32.880 --> 36:42.360]  And Trump has been reminded now, as he criticized Bolton firing him, a lot of people said, you
[36:42.360 --> 36:44.680]  know, you're the one who hired him.
[36:44.680 --> 36:45.680]  Why did you hire him?
[36:45.680 --> 36:46.680]  And that's a good point.
[36:46.680 --> 36:50.480]  That has been the Achilles heel of the Trump administration.
[36:50.480 --> 36:56.880]  The dregs that have been brought into this administration, you have to ask yourself, why?
[36:56.880 --> 37:00.080]  There have been too many bad appointments in the Trump administration.
[37:00.080 --> 37:07.400]  So we look at this more important than anything that was alleged to have been said in private.
[37:07.400 --> 37:12.960]  And again, this is going to be a very interesting legal battle because President Trump has said
[37:12.960 --> 37:17.160]  he's, this is highly classified information and it is.
[37:17.160 --> 37:21.640]  And this is stuff that is said in private, talking about national security issues.
[37:21.640 --> 37:27.480]  This guy who says that we've got to go to war with everybody, John Bolton, because it's
[37:27.480 --> 37:32.240]  about national security and yet he is willing to violate national security so they can attack
[37:32.240 --> 37:35.120]  President Trump and make himself look good.
[37:35.120 --> 37:43.120]  Because he was not sent in merely as this book is born out of not just him being essentially
[37:43.120 --> 37:48.600]  a fifth column within the Trump administration and the policies to make sure that they could
[37:48.600 --> 37:50.560]  get President Trump going in the right direction.
[37:50.560 --> 37:52.440]  If not, they could destroy him.
[37:52.440 --> 37:57.320]  Then it became personal when President Trump criticized him.
[37:57.320 --> 38:00.440]  And President Trump said, I will consider every consideration with me as President to
[38:00.440 --> 38:01.680]  be highly classified.
[38:01.680 --> 38:05.800]  So that would mean if he wrote a book and if the book gets out, he's broken the law.
[38:05.800 --> 38:08.400]  And I would think that he would have criminal problems.
[38:08.400 --> 38:13.640]  Well, that's right because when you look at some of the things that were discussed in
[38:13.640 --> 38:18.640]  this, right, there's the first hand, they're talking about this, they're pushing this book.
[38:18.640 --> 38:24.360]  This Sunday, he's going to have a prime time one hour interview because ABC wants to help
[38:24.360 --> 38:26.240]  anybody that's going to come after President Trump.
[38:26.240 --> 38:30.880]  And so it's going to be a first hand account of crucial moments, private meetings in the
[38:30.880 --> 38:35.640]  Oval Office, the Putin-Trump summit in Helsinki, historic meetings with North Korean leader
[38:35.640 --> 38:38.720]  Kim Jong-un, phone calls that President Trump made.
[38:38.720 --> 38:42.960]  Well, you don't think that's about classified information?
[38:42.960 --> 38:43.960]  National security?
[38:43.960 --> 38:50.320]  So he's going to do this on Sunday with ABC News' Martha Raditz.
[38:50.320 --> 38:55.440]  And it's kind of interesting because when you look at the timing of this book, the book
[38:55.440 --> 38:58.200]  was to be published on the 23rd.
[38:58.200 --> 39:00.800]  So two days would be Tuesday.
[39:00.800 --> 39:04.560]  On Sunday, on the 21st, he's going to have this interview.
[39:04.560 --> 39:09.240]  He's already leaked some information, you know, a few days in advance of that.
[39:09.240 --> 39:12.200]  Now, originally, the Trump administration said, well, you know, since you've been taking
[39:12.200 --> 39:18.240]  notes about all this stuff and since you were in highly secretive position here, and that
[39:18.240 --> 39:23.960]  could be a violation of national security, classified information, we need to review that.
[39:23.960 --> 39:28.360]  Trump administration said, we won't be finished with that until four days before, until the
[39:28.360 --> 39:32.520]  19th, which will be tomorrow, except he's already published the book.
[39:32.520 --> 39:33.520]  They've printed the book.
[39:33.520 --> 39:34.880]  They've distributed the book.
[39:34.880 --> 39:37.120]  He's leaked the book.
[39:37.120 --> 39:43.040]  But of course, he waited until a week after his buddy, Lindsey Graham, had his primary.
[39:43.040 --> 39:46.640]  Very, very interesting timing, isn't it?
[39:46.640 --> 39:54.320]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[39:54.320 --> 39:58.920]  It's finally here, introducing the first of its kind, nascent iodine spray with true
[39:58.920 --> 40:00.400]  atomic iodine.
[40:00.400 --> 40:04.080]  Researchers have been asking us for months to develop an iodine spray made with our
[40:04.080 --> 40:06.880]  exclusive deep earth crystal nascent iodine.
[40:06.880 --> 40:08.840]  After extensive development, it's finally here.
[40:08.840 --> 40:13.480]  Our proprietary new aerodine technology allows us to harness the full power of ancient iodine
[40:13.480 --> 40:17.800]  crystals from 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface into an ultimate spray formula.
[40:17.800 --> 40:21.960]  I have been using the new X2 spray every day, and I feel good knowing that I have the power
[40:21.960 --> 40:24.280]  of true nascent iodine working for my body.
[40:24.280 --> 40:26.000]  I can personally feel the difference.
[40:26.000 --> 40:30.400]  We know iodine is an essential mineral that supports thyroid health, as well as healthy
[40:30.400 --> 40:34.440]  metabolism, healthy hormone levels, and healthy cognitive function.
[40:34.440 --> 40:39.000]  Iodine may also support your body in healthy response to environmental and dietary toxins.

[41:51.480 --> 41:58.960]  I don't like coming to you every day on the radio and TV stations that you watch and listen
[41:58.960 --> 42:03.120]  to a song and telling you all these horrible things, but you notice almost everything we've
[42:03.120 --> 42:05.740]  talked about, horrible, has come true.
[42:05.740 --> 42:09.560]  We were warning everybody to try to stop it.
[42:09.560 --> 42:13.200]  It's like telling somebody if you've got a pool, put a fence around it if you have little
[42:13.200 --> 42:17.120]  kids, because even if they're good swimmers, they can hit their head and drown.
[42:17.120 --> 42:19.560]  People don't listen, they go out and their kid's dead in the pool.
[42:19.560 --> 42:23.080]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, this is the death of the third world and the collapse of the
[42:23.080 --> 42:24.080]  first world.
[42:24.080 --> 42:29.440]  And this is 21st century warfare carried out by the globalist, and they admit they've
[42:29.440 --> 42:30.680]  orchestrated it.
[42:30.680 --> 42:34.120]  They admit it's, quote, good to save the earth, and they're teaching us to be more
[42:34.120 --> 42:39.280]  frugal, and they want to make us poor so they can dictate our surrender to this post-human
[42:39.280 --> 42:40.280]  technocracy.
[42:40.280 --> 42:45.560]  I know all this sounds insane when I was talking about it 25 years ago, but now it's public
[42:45.560 --> 42:48.000]  because it's their operations manual.
[42:48.000 --> 42:52.800]  I wish this wasn't the case, but they're really our evil psychopaths in control of most major
[42:52.800 --> 42:54.960]  institutions and we've got to stop them.

[43:58.200 --> 44:13.340]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show for over 25 years.
[44:13.340 --> 44:19.360]  We have predicted that once the globalists were able to orchestrate major civil unrest
[44:19.360 --> 44:28.460]  in the United States along racial lines that Hollywood and academia would hype, that then
[44:28.460 --> 44:37.400]  Democrats would announce a partnership with the United Nations to create a civilian peacekeeping
[44:37.400 --> 44:39.200]  force.
[44:39.200 --> 44:45.920]  Now the global Clinton initiative and their foundation have come out and said that they
[44:45.920 --> 44:53.240]  want millions of virus tracers for COVID-19 to come to your houses and that they're going
[44:53.240 --> 44:58.320]  to hire those people who are quickly trained, who've been laid off and out of the colleges.
[44:58.320 --> 45:03.240]  So the armies of woke individuals have signed up for the different George Soros organizations
[45:03.240 --> 45:11.360]  like moveon.org, Black Lives Matter, Antifa, the anti-gun groups, all the different Soros
[45:11.360 --> 45:18.520]  funded district attorneys, mayors, sheriffs, and of course attorney generals that they
[45:18.520 --> 45:23.600]  have put in place for this concerted political takeover.
[45:23.600 --> 45:29.640]  And by creating this new political office that actually sits above every city, they
[45:29.640 --> 45:32.920]  will be able to decide who gets what services and who doesn't, who they're going to send
[45:32.920 --> 45:35.880]  to your house and who they're not going to send to your house.
[45:35.880 --> 45:40.720]  So instead when there's a domestic violence report or a break-in report, they decide because
[45:40.720 --> 45:46.360]  of who you are, who they're going to send and instead they send a political commissar
[45:46.360 --> 45:51.520]  to your home social worker to decide what move they're going to make next.
[45:51.520 --> 45:53.400]  This is secret police.
[45:53.400 --> 45:56.040]  This has been their plan from the beginning.
[45:56.040 --> 45:58.040]  We have warned everyone over and over again.
[45:58.040 --> 46:05.360]  Now, yesterday Albuquerque announced they're creating this fourth branch of essential service,
[46:05.360 --> 46:10.240]  the unarmed social workers that come, but they're not really unarmed because the minute
[46:10.240 --> 46:14.640]  you don't do what they want, they snap their fingers and the police come, but now because
[46:14.640 --> 46:19.640]  they have this political power, the police will be protected, either do the right thing
[46:19.640 --> 46:25.480]  or the wrong thing because the media is not going to report on it in a bad light.
[46:25.480 --> 46:27.680]  That's how this whole thing operates.
[46:27.680 --> 46:31.680]  With the big tech censorship and the mainstream media not reporting on the 10 to 1 black on
[46:31.680 --> 46:36.520]  white crime, all the hate crimes against whites, massively exploding, all of this, it creates
[46:36.520 --> 46:40.800]  the perception actually that whites are out there purging and hunting blacks when really
[46:40.800 --> 46:45.040]  statistically very, very sadly, thanks to the woke culture, it's the other way around.
[46:45.040 --> 46:52.000]  This is a very sophisticated, strong cities, UN initiative, all codified by Loretta Lynch
[46:52.000 --> 46:56.920]  six years ago, two days of video at the UN website of them laying out the whole plan.
[46:56.920 --> 46:59.200]  It's all State Department random 7277.
[46:59.200 --> 47:03.520]  It's all general and complete disarmament, the peaceful world, except when you read the
[47:03.520 --> 47:09.840]  document it says that the special UN approved paramilitary brigades with social workers
[47:09.840 --> 47:12.880]  under them will be authorized and will be in your town.
[47:12.880 --> 47:15.800]  Your police will be disarmed, your sheriffs will be abolished.
[47:15.800 --> 47:21.000]  That's already happening totally backwards where cities are getting laws passed, where
[47:21.000 --> 47:24.720]  they're getting the counties to get rid of the sheriff and merge it into the police department
[47:24.720 --> 47:25.720]  so it's not elected.
[47:25.720 --> 47:30.240]  This is systematically about cutting the people out of their communities, cutting out oversight,
[47:30.240 --> 47:35.520]  cutting out transparency, cutting out low control and bringing in centralized control
[47:35.520 --> 47:37.480]  in front of everyone.
[47:37.480 --> 47:42.680]  So again, this is community review boards filled with Antifa and other globalist communist
[47:42.680 --> 47:50.040]  trash who have a political stranglehold on the towns, who will then be an office inside
[47:50.040 --> 47:54.920]  in phase one every department to actually be on the ground reporting on the police,
[47:54.920 --> 48:01.120]  rattling on the police, micromanaging the police and maneuvering them towards full absorption
[48:01.120 --> 48:02.560]  into the UN program.
[48:02.560 --> 48:03.760]  Now let's move on from that.
[48:03.760 --> 48:07.680]  As soon as the mayor came out and announced that, LA didn't want to get beaten to the
[48:07.680 --> 48:08.680]  punch.
[48:08.680 --> 48:12.720]  They came out with the exact same program, the exact same proposal because it's the exact
[48:12.720 --> 48:14.360]  same operation.
[48:14.360 --> 48:16.640]  Now they're announcing it in Europe as well.
[48:16.640 --> 48:22.600]  It's a global movement, all the big corporations, all the big media, all the big academia, all
[48:22.600 --> 48:27.440]  the big banks, all the big ecclesiastical groups, they're all for this wokeness and
[48:27.440 --> 48:32.400]  oh, they care so much about the 14 black men that die wrongfully at the hands of police
[48:32.400 --> 48:34.960]  every year on average in the United States.
[48:34.960 --> 48:39.280]  And now no one can criticize Black Lives Matter, no one can talk about them, talk show hosts
[48:39.280 --> 48:44.520]  that just say all lives matter are being fired, columnists are being fired, you just can't
[48:44.520 --> 48:49.880]  say that, no, no, no, it's the black lives and the media represents the black people
[48:49.880 --> 48:54.840]  as a shield that they hold up and say, oop, don't be racist, I represent black people,
[48:54.840 --> 48:58.520]  you've got to accept the United Nations in control of your police department.
[48:58.520 --> 49:02.440]  And this isn't some far away thing, it's not like headlights at night off the distance,
[49:02.440 --> 49:06.320]  you're not sure it's a car, a truck, what it is, this is the car pulling into your driveway
[49:06.320 --> 49:07.320]  at night.
[49:07.320 --> 49:13.800]  Okay, it's there, it's what it is, it's materialized, it's happening, the games are over and now
[49:13.800 --> 49:16.720]  we've got to ask ourselves, what's the next phase of this?
[49:16.720 --> 49:21.160]  Well, we've obviously got to speak out against it and expose it because this is Agenda 21,
[49:21.160 --> 49:25.560]  it's Agenda 2030 and if you go read all those human documents, it's just an extension of
[49:25.560 --> 49:30.200]  what they have been planning the entire time and it is the exact same plan.
[49:30.200 --> 49:35.400]  And so I'm begging listeners and I'm begging viewers to understand this is not like past
[49:35.400 --> 49:37.400]  leftist stuff you've seen before.
[49:37.400 --> 49:42.560]  That was them just digging into the society, getting control, setting up their boards, buying
[49:42.560 --> 49:45.040]  off the politicians, everything lined up.
[49:45.040 --> 49:50.240]  The Democrats and the deep state have control of every major city in the United States is
[49:50.240 --> 49:57.280]  now blue, they have election fraud in place, they are systematically expanding that power,
[49:57.280 --> 50:01.160]  they are systematically shipping drugs in, getting the homeless on the drugs, then the
[50:01.160 --> 50:06.680]  Democrats and these different NGOs manage each one of those homeless people and skim
[50:06.680 --> 50:10.800]  about half the money off the top from them, they then parlay that money, not just into
[50:10.800 --> 50:12.680]  their own houses and cars and boats.
[50:12.680 --> 50:19.800]  So they push that then into hiring more bureaucrats, more social workers, more NGOs all under UN
[50:19.800 --> 50:24.440]  certification and control who then come in and encourage again, oh, you can camp on people's
[50:24.440 --> 50:27.960]  private property, oh, you can camp in front of somebody's house, oh, there's more services
[50:27.960 --> 50:32.560]  for the homeless to fix this homeless problem, but instead the homeless problem only explodes
[50:32.560 --> 50:36.160]  because they're literally farming these people, same thing with illegal aliens, that's why
[50:36.160 --> 50:39.360]  they're breaking down the borders right as the UN implodes the third world.
[50:39.360 --> 50:43.960]  They bring in masses of these illegals, tens of millions of them, then they encourage them
[50:43.960 --> 50:48.600]  not to get jobs, they encourage them not to work, they shut down the economy with COVID-19,
[50:48.600 --> 50:53.080]  they sign them up for welfare, but they order them to go get a part-time job somewhere,
[50:53.080 --> 50:56.960]  whether it be in sex, traffic, you name it, and then they skim part of that money off.
[50:56.960 --> 51:00.120]  I have seen hundreds and hundreds of articles over the years, but now there's a total media
[51:00.120 --> 51:04.440]  clampdown, so you don't see it when it happens, where the local Democrats in Austin and San
[51:04.440 --> 51:09.920]  Antonio in Dallas and Houston out in California, everywhere in the United States, New York,
[51:09.920 --> 51:15.080]  Boston, I mean, everywhere, they will catch people in dungeons, in basements, and generally
[51:15.080 --> 51:20.360]  it's local Hispanic leaders who are actually coyotes and who are holding them as prisoners
[51:20.360 --> 51:25.040]  and slaves because other members of their family have not paid them enough of the money
[51:25.040 --> 51:30.320]  that they get from their jobs and from welfare, I mean, this is such a criminal operation,
[51:30.320 --> 51:35.000]  and that's why Pelosi called MS-13 God's children, and that's why they're so angry
[51:35.000 --> 51:40.880]  at Trump trying to shut off the fentanyl, because this is a designed rollout plan where
[51:40.880 --> 51:45.720]  they want the homeless completely passed out on the streets, and again, you can go to 100-plus
[51:45.720 --> 51:51.760]  cities in the United States and go through huge 20, 30, 40 square block areas in the
[51:51.760 --> 51:57.280]  case of Austin or in the case of places like LA, and you will just see people laid out,
[51:57.280 --> 52:01.600]  passed out at noon in the sun with feces and urine running down the street because they're
[52:01.600 --> 52:06.280]  on fentanyl, that again, it shipped into them, the police are ordered, and I've been there,
[52:06.280 --> 52:09.480]  I've interviewed the police, they've given us tours, they're ordered not to bust any
[52:09.480 --> 52:14.800]  of the drug dealers, they're ordered not to stop any of the gangs and the prostitution,
[52:14.800 --> 52:20.000]  and it's just expanding and expanding like a huge black hole, sucking everyone into it.
[52:20.000 --> 52:23.880]  So as soon as you're like Chicago and have 20, 30, 40 black people kill each other a
[52:23.880 --> 52:27.720]  week, that's not even a news item because that's all part of the larger plan.
[52:27.720 --> 52:33.400]  That's an open air drug den, prostitution den, gambling den, human trafficking den.
[52:33.400 --> 52:37.520]  So again, they have a very sophisticated plan, but then when a cop might do something wrong,
[52:37.520 --> 52:41.360]  might use too much force, like in the case of Atlanta, well, they throw the book at them
[52:41.360 --> 52:47.240]  because it's white on black and they can accentuate that false idea and stereotype that the cops
[52:47.240 --> 52:50.960]  were all bloodthirsty killers out trying to hunt down black people, when in reality,
[52:50.960 --> 52:55.640]  they slow roll into the black areas now and that is allowing the crime to explode, which
[52:55.640 --> 52:59.800]  again, the Democrats and the organized crime, the control that have done by design for over
[52:59.800 --> 53:03.440]  a hundred years, the Democrats have been working on sucking off poor people in their cities
[53:03.440 --> 53:07.080]  and now they've just made a scientific plan, they've tailored it, Europe is bringing in
[53:07.080 --> 53:11.400]  Muslims and others and creating no go zones and doing the exact same formula again and
[53:11.400 --> 53:13.720]  then milking off the top of that money as well.
[53:13.720 --> 53:18.400]  This is a takedown plan and it's totally criminal, it's totally evil and this is what you get
[53:18.400 --> 53:23.120]  when you have these Democrat mayors and others that claim they have this moral high ground
[53:23.120 --> 53:26.920]  and so by golly, they're going to set up this new arm of the city government, but it's
[53:26.920 --> 53:30.480]  not an arm of the city government, it's an arm of political control to bring in their
[53:30.480 --> 53:34.640]  politicos and give them political power and you just imagine how bad it is when Antifa
[53:34.640 --> 53:39.200]  and BLM and the Communists have that police power, that's when we go to the physical
[53:39.200 --> 53:42.880]  civil war, unfortunately, so this is their plan to win and to see control of the cities
[53:42.880 --> 53:47.880]  ahead of the takedown of the economy and total martial law and all that stands between their
[53:47.880 --> 53:52.480]  operation and our future is our action, our prayers, our understanding how serious this
[53:52.480 --> 53:56.680]  is and Donald Trump and others taking action and realizing how serious this is.
[53:56.680 --> 54:00.480]  They've put up the corruption so long that the nation has cancer now and so the good
[54:00.480 --> 54:04.560]  old boys networks up at the justice department allow this criminal conspiracy of Loretta
[54:04.560 --> 54:08.800]  Lynch, the UN, Obama and Hillary to continue, they themselves will be destroyed as well
[54:08.800 --> 54:12.680]  because what's clear now is you're not going to have a two-party system sharing power anymore,
[54:12.680 --> 54:13.680]  okay?
[54:13.680 --> 54:17.320]  The knives are out and one of the parties is going to be basically cut up and destroyed
[54:17.320 --> 54:22.680]  and the original party that survives is going to split into two and the Democrats see themselves
[54:22.680 --> 54:23.680]  as the original party.
[54:23.680 --> 54:27.920]  There was only one party at first, the Republican Party came around in slavery, obviously, with
[54:27.920 --> 54:32.680]  Abraham Lincoln and so this is do or die time, people better get serious.
[54:32.680 --> 54:36.160]  Back to David Knight on the live transmission on the other side of this quick break, ImphilWars.com
[54:36.160 --> 54:44.640]  tomorrow's news today.
[54:44.640 --> 54:53.200]  It's finally here, introducing the new survival shield X2 spray, available now for 33% off
[54:53.200 --> 54:57.120]  at infowarsstore.com.
[54:57.120 --> 55:03.560]  Listeners have been asking us for months to develop an iodine spray made with our exclusive
[55:03.560 --> 55:06.960]  deep earth crystal nascent iodine.
[55:06.960 --> 55:14.160]  Our proprietary new aerodine technology allows us to harness the full power of ancient iodine
[55:14.160 --> 55:21.840]  crystals from 7,000 feet below the earth's surface into the ultimate spray formula.
[55:21.840 --> 55:27.880]  Iodine is an essential mineral that helps support thyroid health, healthy metabolism,
[55:27.880 --> 55:29.720]  and healthy cognitive function.
[55:29.720 --> 55:37.880]  Get the new survival shield X2 spray for 33% off-intro pricing at infowarsstore.com.

[55:46.280 --> 55:53.200]  This is the end, my friends, my only friends, the end of our elaborate plans, the end of
[55:53.200 --> 55:59.040]  everything that stands the end, the safety, the delusion.
[55:59.040 --> 56:05.400]  It's all over, ladies and gentlemen, because it was only the mirage of safety, movies and
[56:05.400 --> 56:10.840]  partying and living like children, ever growing up, ever caring about other people.
[56:10.840 --> 56:14.520]  This delivered us into the hands of tyranny.
[56:14.520 --> 56:18.480]  Just like the history book show, it's just like the Bible states, every time Israel became
[56:18.480 --> 56:23.720]  corrupt and evil and turned away from God, they were brought into captivity because their
[56:23.720 --> 56:30.440]  people sold out to special interest and were infiltrated by spies and then they were enslaved.
[56:30.440 --> 56:36.160]  We are repeating that again today, compliance and going along with this system leads to
[56:36.160 --> 56:38.960]  absolute bondage.
[56:38.960 --> 56:41.080]  Infowars has decided to fight for freedom.
[56:41.080 --> 56:47.640]  Infowars has had great victory thanks to your support and your prayers.
[56:47.640 --> 57:02.960]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[57:02.960 --> 57:15.600]  All right, let's take some more of the mask off of this COVID pandemic.
[57:15.600 --> 57:21.920]  We have Sadiq Khan in London saying that mandatory masks will be the new normal for at least
[57:21.920 --> 57:22.920]  another year.
[57:22.920 --> 57:26.680]  They may never let you take those masks off.
[57:26.680 --> 57:30.000]  There is a full court press going on right now.
[57:30.000 --> 57:34.360]  The political establishment, especially the media, we've got one mainstream media after
[57:34.360 --> 57:36.000]  the other in the last couple of days.
[57:36.000 --> 57:43.920]  We've had a fact check from USA Today, we've got the LA Times, we've got NBC News, all
[57:43.920 --> 57:47.480]  of them talking about, well, there's this debate about masks and so forth, and they're
[57:47.480 --> 57:51.280]  trying to convince people very, very hard that you should wear your mask.
[57:51.280 --> 57:57.240]  Let me tell you, this is about more than just the medical issue.
[57:57.240 --> 58:02.160]  Why do we have to take medical advice from these politicians?
[58:02.160 --> 58:05.640]  Why can't we let our doctors decide this?
[58:05.640 --> 58:10.920]  My wife has been to a couple of different doctors the last couple of weeks for some minor things.
[58:10.920 --> 58:16.400]  I'm glad to say that it's minor, but in both instances, in one of them, they had the full
[58:16.400 --> 58:17.400]  drill.
[58:17.400 --> 58:21.320]  They're taking your temperature when you come in, giving you a mask because we don't have
[58:21.320 --> 58:22.320]  masks.
[58:22.320 --> 58:24.320]  We don't carry masks.
[58:24.320 --> 58:26.640]  Haven't done that this entire time.
[58:26.640 --> 58:30.720]  And then as soon as she gets in the room with the doctor, he says, let's take these stupid
[58:30.720 --> 58:32.960]  things off.
[58:32.960 --> 58:34.720]  Another doctor, same thing.
[58:34.720 --> 58:35.720]  That doesn't do any good.
[58:35.720 --> 58:38.480]  Actually it's harmful for you.
[58:38.480 --> 58:42.560]  And if you understand what these masks are about, folks, the N95, why do they call it
[58:42.560 --> 58:43.560]  an N95?
[58:43.560 --> 58:45.800]  Well, here's the facts.
[58:45.800 --> 58:52.560]  It can collect 95% of particles that are 0.3 microns or larger.
[58:52.560 --> 58:54.400]  Not 100%, but 95%.
[58:54.400 --> 58:58.320]  If you've got it tied around your face, and of course, I've got a beard, so it doesn't
[58:58.320 --> 59:00.520]  work anyway.
[59:00.520 --> 59:04.080]  But it gets some if there's 0.3 microns or larger.
[59:04.080 --> 59:09.680]  One is, COVID-19 is 0.125 microns.
[59:09.680 --> 59:14.400]  That's about third the size of the smallest ones that it can get.
[59:14.400 --> 59:16.720]  And it only gets 95% of those.
[59:16.720 --> 59:22.400]  Now the fact checkers will come out, like USA Today, and they'll say, oh, well, that's
[59:22.400 --> 59:23.600]  fake news.
[59:23.600 --> 59:32.160]  You really can catch mosquitoes if you put up a hurricane chain link fence.
[59:32.160 --> 59:33.920]  Don't believe the numbers.
[59:33.920 --> 59:36.360]  Remove their narrative.
[59:36.360 --> 59:39.480]  And they say, well, you know, it doesn't just travel by itself.
[59:39.480 --> 59:41.480]  It's attached to stuff.
[59:41.480 --> 59:42.480]  Like your spit and things.
[59:42.480 --> 59:45.480]  Well, you know what else is attached to your spit?
[59:45.480 --> 59:49.280]  Bacteria that your body is trying to expel.
[59:49.280 --> 59:53.480]  And then, of course, it also decreases the amount of oxygen in your blood.
[59:53.480 --> 59:55.480]  It increases the amount of CO2.
[59:55.480 --> 1:00:00.240]  Those are each one of those are their own health condition.
[1:00:00.240 --> 1:00:05.960]  A few weeks ago, we had this story here at InfoWars, a guy wearing a mask by himself
[1:00:05.960 --> 1:00:08.720]  in his car with the windows rolled up.
[1:00:08.720 --> 1:00:12.920]  He passed out from lack of oxygen, hit a tree.
[1:00:12.920 --> 1:00:15.240]  So yeah, it has consequences.
[1:00:15.240 --> 1:00:16.400]  But you got the LA Times.
[1:00:16.400 --> 1:00:20.160]  Why are so many people not wearing masks?
[1:00:20.160 --> 1:00:25.040]  And another one from NBC News, necessary or needless, three months in the pandemic, Americans
[1:00:25.040 --> 1:00:28.080]  are still divided on wearing masks.
[1:00:28.080 --> 1:00:33.520]  And then again, by showing a picture of a young pretty nurse, she says, you really want
[1:00:33.520 --> 1:00:34.680]  to argue this with me?
[1:00:34.680 --> 1:00:36.960]  She says to a man, I'm a nurse.
[1:00:36.960 --> 1:00:39.480]  Well, you know, talk to your doctor about this.
[1:00:39.480 --> 1:00:40.760]  Don't talk to NBC News.
[1:00:40.760 --> 1:00:42.160]  Don't talk to LA Times.
[1:00:42.160 --> 1:00:43.320]  Don't even listen to me.
[1:00:43.320 --> 1:00:44.320]  Talk to your doctor.
[1:00:44.320 --> 1:00:48.200]  You know, we have the same called a doctor-patient relationship that they want to destroy.
[1:00:48.200 --> 1:00:50.920]  We have the same called informed consent that they want to destroy.
[1:00:50.920 --> 1:00:54.160]  And that folks is why they're doing this with the mask.
[1:00:54.160 --> 1:01:00.800]  It's the same logic that they use for the vaccines.
[1:01:00.800 --> 1:01:04.360]  You are not protected if you get the vaccine.
[1:01:04.360 --> 1:01:09.840]  You're only protected if I get the vaccine, the herd mentality.
[1:01:09.840 --> 1:01:12.160]  You are not protected if you wear one of these masks.
[1:01:12.160 --> 1:01:16.280]  So argue about how effective these masks are because, you know, they get the virus, doesn't
[1:01:16.280 --> 1:01:18.200]  travel by itself and travels with spit.
[1:01:18.200 --> 1:01:19.200]  Oh, okay.
[1:01:19.200 --> 1:01:20.200]  Well, fine.
[1:01:20.200 --> 1:01:22.720]  Then you can filter it out on your side.
[1:01:22.720 --> 1:01:23.720]  Wear your mask.
[1:01:23.720 --> 1:01:24.720]  Oh, no, no.
[1:01:24.720 --> 1:01:25.720]  I'm not protected.
[1:01:25.720 --> 1:01:29.680]  If I'm wearing a mask, you've got to wear the mask to protect me.
[1:01:29.680 --> 1:01:33.640]  And now we have politicians who are pushing that very hard, and we'll tell you when we
[1:01:33.640 --> 1:01:38.960]  come back, because I want to talk about America being held hostage, the approaches of different
[1:01:38.960 --> 1:01:43.880]  governors here in Texas and in Arizona, two Republican governors, two different ideas
[1:01:43.880 --> 1:01:49.840]  on how to do this, eight cities run by Democrats begging to tie you down with masks.
[1:01:49.840 --> 1:01:56.840]  We'll be right back, so do this.
[1:01:56.840 --> 1:02:05.320]  Globalists have gotten away with their Russiagate hoax, their Ukraine hoax, their COVID-19 hoax,
[1:02:05.320 --> 1:02:11.320]  and now it's the race riot hoax of 2020.
[1:02:11.320 --> 1:02:14.840]  We've got to ask ourselves what's coming next, what I can tell you.
[1:02:14.840 --> 1:02:20.040]  It's going to be a bunch of big, old, fat mass shootings to create even a bigger race
[1:02:20.040 --> 1:02:21.040]  war.
[1:02:21.040 --> 1:02:26.200]  It's going to be economic collapse, China invading Taiwan, Hong Kong, you name it.
[1:02:26.200 --> 1:02:28.760]  The globalists are attacking on every front.
[1:02:28.760 --> 1:02:32.880]  That's why now, more than ever, we have to realize, they tried to censor them for wars
[1:02:32.880 --> 1:02:37.720]  off the air, because they knew that when they watched this whole situation, that they didn't
[1:02:37.720 --> 1:02:40.120]  want the people's voice to still be on air.
[1:02:40.120 --> 1:02:44.320]  But thanks to you and our crew, we are still on air.
[1:02:44.320 --> 1:02:51.320]  So let's boost that transmission like a Batman signal now, more than ever, Infowars.com lives.
[1:02:51.320 --> 1:03:03.840]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show, and now
[1:03:03.840 --> 1:03:15.800]  your host, David Knight, folks, let's talk about the lockdown, because that, I believe,
[1:03:15.800 --> 1:03:22.080]  is still at the basis of what is happening as we see the Marxist and Befaw, the Black
[1:03:22.080 --> 1:03:26.600]  Lives Marxists, isn't the Black Lives Matter?
[1:03:26.600 --> 1:03:28.520]  Black Lives do matter.
[1:03:28.520 --> 1:03:30.320]  All color lives matter.
[1:03:30.320 --> 1:03:34.440]  But these people are using this for their Marxist agenda, but the basis for why they're
[1:03:34.440 --> 1:03:40.720]  doing this and what is getting people on both sides, you realize the tactic that is often
[1:03:40.720 --> 1:03:44.800]  used by the police during a protest or riot, they call it kettling, right?
[1:03:44.800 --> 1:03:45.800]  What do they do?
[1:03:45.800 --> 1:03:49.440]  Well, it's kind of like a pincer movement, you know, you start to contain the crowd,
[1:03:49.440 --> 1:03:54.520]  you push them back into an area where you can grab everybody.
[1:03:54.520 --> 1:04:00.480]  And it's a very well-known tactic, as a matter of fact, they did it to Rob Dew when he was
[1:04:00.480 --> 1:04:03.400]  covering an event, covering a riot as a reporter.
[1:04:03.400 --> 1:04:06.600]  He got kettled into the crowd and arrested.
[1:04:06.600 --> 1:04:10.240]  They did some pretty nasty things to him, just as a reporter.
[1:04:10.240 --> 1:04:18.480]  And so this is a long-held tactic, but you understand that you are being kettled not
[1:04:18.480 --> 1:04:23.640]  by the police, you're being kettled by the politicians and the propaganda press, the
[1:04:23.640 --> 1:04:26.080]  mockingbird media.
[1:04:26.080 --> 1:04:30.080]  They're kettling you into one of two positions.
[1:04:30.080 --> 1:04:37.160]  Either you stand with the rioters or you stand with the police who are using excessive force.
[1:04:37.160 --> 1:04:39.200]  Take your pick.
[1:04:39.200 --> 1:04:40.800]  You can't have any other way, right?
[1:04:40.800 --> 1:04:47.560]  You can't say that, well, you know, a peaceful protest, that's guaranteed under the Constitution.
[1:04:47.560 --> 1:04:50.240]  If people are rioting, then, you know, respond with force.
[1:04:50.240 --> 1:04:51.320]  You can't say that.
[1:04:51.320 --> 1:04:52.720]  We've got to reform the police.
[1:04:52.720 --> 1:04:56.840]  No, no, no, you've got to pick one side or the other, and you've got to say that you've
[1:04:56.840 --> 1:05:02.440]  got to sign on either to the looting or to the police brutality.
[1:05:02.440 --> 1:05:03.440]  That's the kettling.
[1:05:03.440 --> 1:05:07.840]  It's also called a Hegelian dialectic.
[1:05:07.840 --> 1:05:14.960]  You have the thesis, the antithesis, and the two of those are being used to force you into
[1:05:14.960 --> 1:05:19.160]  what they really want, which is the synthesis.
[1:05:19.160 --> 1:05:22.120]  And this is what the two-party system is about.
[1:05:22.120 --> 1:05:27.320]  This has been, it's a kettling, a Hegelian dialectic, and this is the way you're being
[1:05:27.320 --> 1:05:28.320]  controlled right now.
[1:05:28.320 --> 1:05:33.440]  So let's talk about America being held hostage, and again, this is day 93 by my reckoning.
[1:05:33.440 --> 1:05:40.760]  I count it from the day that we got locked down here in Austin, March the 17th.
[1:05:40.760 --> 1:05:44.520]  But actually, I think the last normal day that we had, as somebody pointed out, was
[1:05:44.520 --> 1:05:45.520]  Friday the 13th.
[1:05:45.520 --> 1:05:50.480]  It was over the weekend that things started really going bad.
[1:05:50.480 --> 1:05:51.680]  That was Friday the 13th.
[1:05:51.680 --> 1:05:57.720]  That was the day that these two smart people, Fauci and Berks, went to President Trump.
[1:05:57.720 --> 1:05:59.000]  And we now know they're not smart.
[1:05:59.000 --> 1:06:01.920]  They're wise guys, mafia figures.
[1:06:01.920 --> 1:06:04.480]  They came to him and they said, you know, we've got this thing from the Imperial College.
[1:06:04.480 --> 1:06:06.000]  One, oh, that sounds very impressive.
[1:06:06.000 --> 1:06:10.920]  And they say, two million people are going to die if you don't lock down the country.
[1:06:10.920 --> 1:06:12.840]  So then they put out the guidelines and recommendations.
[1:06:12.840 --> 1:06:16.520]  Immediately you had California, New York shut everything down.
[1:06:16.520 --> 1:06:21.880]  You had Democrat strongholds like Austin follow.
[1:06:21.880 --> 1:06:29.320]  And even though we are now relaxed, like 50% occupancy in restaurants and churches and
[1:06:29.320 --> 1:06:36.200]  so forth here in Texas, the Democrat mayors are just bristling at the freedom that we
[1:06:36.200 --> 1:06:37.200]  have here.
[1:06:37.200 --> 1:06:38.200]  They've got to stop this.
[1:06:38.200 --> 1:06:44.000]  And so you've got the mayor of Houston, Mayor Turner, eight other mayors are demanding that
[1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:51.040]  Governor Abbott let them put masks on our faces, force us to wear masks.
[1:06:51.040 --> 1:06:57.200]  You've got San Antonio, Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth, El Paso, Arlington, Plano, Grand Prairie,
[1:06:57.200 --> 1:07:02.640]  Grand Prairie, all saying we've got to have the authority to set rules and regulations
[1:07:02.640 --> 1:07:06.320]  to force people to wear this stuff.
[1:07:06.320 --> 1:07:12.400]  And of course, this is what the establishment of the deep state pulled off 9-11.
[1:07:12.400 --> 1:07:18.760]  They wrote these types of regulations before they pulled off 9-11 a few months before 9-11.
[1:07:18.760 --> 1:07:22.680]  They wrote the Model State Emergency Health Powers Act and understand how this goes.
[1:07:22.680 --> 1:07:29.200]  We have the United Nations writes things like Agenda 21 and they put these recommendations
[1:07:29.200 --> 1:07:36.120]  and guidelines out to the various states to enforce them.
[1:07:36.120 --> 1:07:38.640]  And then they say, well, you know, we're not imposing this.
[1:07:38.640 --> 1:07:41.920]  Oh, no, no, you just put out the model legislation and you're waiting for people to put that
[1:07:41.920 --> 1:07:42.920]  in.
[1:07:42.920 --> 1:07:44.600]  That's where we get smart cities, ideas and so forth.
[1:07:44.600 --> 1:07:50.640]  It's now become the Agenda 21 has now become the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainability.
[1:07:50.640 --> 1:07:51.760]  It was all about the environment.
[1:07:51.760 --> 1:07:57.960]  But of course, again, they removed the justification of saving the planet from melting down because
[1:07:57.960 --> 1:07:59.600]  of Cal Farts.
[1:07:59.600 --> 1:08:05.320]  And now everybody's going to die because of a virus.
[1:08:05.320 --> 1:08:06.720]  And they got everything that they wanted.
[1:08:06.720 --> 1:08:13.600]  And we've even got a UN official coming out and saying this is a fire drill for sustainability
[1:08:13.600 --> 1:08:15.440]  for the UN 2030 Agenda.
[1:08:15.440 --> 1:08:19.120]  What is happening with COVID-19 is a fire drill.
[1:08:19.120 --> 1:08:22.840]  And the other part of that is the riots and that's all about civil rights and you really
[1:08:22.840 --> 1:08:27.160]  do need the United Nations, not only our plan, but you need us to come in and help you to
[1:08:27.160 --> 1:08:31.920]  fix this because we're there for human rights.
[1:08:31.920 --> 1:08:36.560]  And as you look at the response of this, even this executive order, the whole premise
[1:08:36.560 --> 1:08:43.440]  that all of these problems can be solved if we just centralize the control more, if instead
[1:08:43.440 --> 1:08:48.760]  of having the control locally over the police department, we need to have it at the federal
[1:08:48.760 --> 1:08:49.760]  government level.
[1:08:49.760 --> 1:08:50.760]  And guess what?
[1:08:50.760 --> 1:08:55.440]  That's not going to be good enough either because not only is the centralized control
[1:08:55.440 --> 1:09:01.480]  of the police and their input into this, that is what has been militarizing the police and
[1:09:01.480 --> 1:09:09.080]  driving excessive force, a shoot first training program and all of the military weapons that
[1:09:09.080 --> 1:09:13.880]  have been put out to the various cities.
[1:09:13.880 --> 1:09:20.480]  But it is also the whole idea that you can fix this if you go centralized.
[1:09:20.480 --> 1:09:23.480]  That is the antithesis of what America was about.
[1:09:23.480 --> 1:09:27.880]  America was about decentralized control because that's what you have to have if you're going
[1:09:27.880 --> 1:09:30.360]  to have liberty of any sort.
[1:09:30.360 --> 1:09:36.240]  Consolidation of power is the prescription for tyranny.
[1:09:36.240 --> 1:09:39.720]  And so when we look at this, just remember what Ronald Reagan said, he said, government
[1:09:39.720 --> 1:09:40.720]  is not the solution.
[1:09:40.720 --> 1:09:41.720]  It is a problem.
[1:09:41.720 --> 1:09:47.600]  Let me tell you, centralization, turning this federalization of any problem is only going
[1:09:47.600 --> 1:09:51.560]  to make that problem worse, but that's not where it ends.
[1:09:51.560 --> 1:09:53.960]  It ends with the United Nations.
[1:09:53.960 --> 1:09:58.600]  They're already talking about how they're going to globalize this, come up with global
[1:09:58.600 --> 1:09:59.800]  sets of rules.
[1:09:59.800 --> 1:10:01.840]  You'll have to report to these people globally.
[1:10:01.840 --> 1:10:08.240]  And so when we look at this, fortunately, Governor Abbott has declined to do this.
[1:10:08.240 --> 1:10:11.240]  He said, I make it clear on a daily basis around the entire state of Texas that wearing
[1:10:11.240 --> 1:10:15.120]  a mask is very important and local officials send that message.
[1:10:15.120 --> 1:10:19.400]  Putting people in jail, however, is the wrong approach for this.
[1:10:19.400 --> 1:10:26.280]  I've been very critical of Governor Abbott for imposing any of these rules.
[1:10:26.280 --> 1:10:30.160]  Because people have criticized him for that, he's relaxed the rules in many cases, and
[1:10:30.160 --> 1:10:34.720]  to his credit, he is not allowing these Democrat mayors to push him on this.
[1:10:34.720 --> 1:10:36.280]  But let me tell you something.
[1:10:36.280 --> 1:10:39.160]  If you're half free, that means that you're half slave.
[1:10:39.160 --> 1:10:48.200]  And we've got to stop this altogether before they roll out the next wave of this.
[1:10:48.200 --> 1:10:50.240]  Whatever happened to informed consent, right?
[1:10:50.240 --> 1:10:51.920]  This is what Governor Abbott is talking about.
[1:10:51.920 --> 1:10:55.360]  Look, let's tell people what we know, and then we'll let them make the decision.
[1:10:55.360 --> 1:10:56.360]  And guess what?
[1:10:56.360 --> 1:11:00.280]  If I make the wrong decision, then you can use me as exhibit A. See, look, he didn't
[1:11:00.280 --> 1:11:01.280]  wear a mask.
[1:11:01.280 --> 1:11:03.800]  He never wore a mask.
[1:11:03.800 --> 1:11:07.760]  David Knight never did anything different during this whole coronavirus thing.
[1:11:07.760 --> 1:11:09.240]  And see, he died.
[1:11:09.240 --> 1:11:12.000]  Yeah, he drove around with his windows down.
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:15.440]  He drove around with a top down on his car everywhere he went.
[1:11:15.440 --> 1:11:19.360]  He went into any store that wouldn't kick him out because he wasn't wearing a mask.
[1:11:19.360 --> 1:11:20.360]  And he died.
[1:11:20.360 --> 1:11:21.360]  Oh, wait a minute.
[1:11:21.360 --> 1:11:22.360]  He didn't die.
[1:11:22.360 --> 1:11:26.000]  See, it's not as dangerous as the health experts are saying.
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:27.160]  See, it works both ways.
[1:11:27.160 --> 1:11:29.920]  I'm willing to be patient zero for you.
[1:11:29.920 --> 1:11:31.880]  I'm willing to be a guinea pig for you.
[1:11:31.880 --> 1:11:36.440]  They're going to take people who will be guinea pigs for their COVID vaccine, aren't they?
[1:11:36.440 --> 1:11:37.440]  They've already done that.
[1:11:37.440 --> 1:11:41.040]  It hasn't worked out too well for some of them either.
[1:11:41.040 --> 1:11:45.320]  After giving these people the vaccine, they're going to call for some of them to take the
[1:11:45.320 --> 1:11:49.240]  vaccine and then be exposed to COVID-19.
[1:11:49.240 --> 1:11:54.040]  Now they couldn't do that, Fauci pointed out, when they had the Ebola scare.
[1:11:54.040 --> 1:11:57.920]  So we can't give something to the people when 80% of them are going to die and it's going
[1:11:57.920 --> 1:12:02.640]  to turn your internal organs into liquefy them, right?
[1:12:02.640 --> 1:12:04.640]  We can't do that.
[1:12:04.640 --> 1:12:10.560]  That's against the Geneva, another Geneva convention, the Nuremberg Code.
[1:12:10.560 --> 1:12:15.520]  You cannot volunteer for something that is likely going to kill you.
[1:12:15.520 --> 1:12:21.800]  But if you can volunteer for COVID-19, that means it's not likely to kill you.
[1:12:21.800 --> 1:12:25.040]  That means it's not nearly as dangerous as they're saying.
[1:12:25.040 --> 1:12:30.600]  But I volunteered to be part of the control experiment group that doesn't wear a mask
[1:12:30.600 --> 1:12:36.860]  ever, because I value my freedom more than I value my life.
[1:12:36.860 --> 1:12:38.840]  That was a principle on which this country was founded.
[1:12:38.840 --> 1:12:39.840]  And you know what?
[1:12:39.840 --> 1:12:42.360]  If you don't value your freedom more than life, you will never have it.
[1:12:42.360 --> 1:12:46.760]  And if you don't allow other people to have freedom, you won't have it either.
[1:12:46.760 --> 1:12:47.760]  We'll be right back.
[1:12:47.760 --> 1:12:50.920]  Stay with us.
[1:12:50.920 --> 1:12:54.200]  The people of the world have awakened to globalism.
[1:12:54.200 --> 1:12:59.360]  And so populist movements are throwing the globalist out of their countries.
[1:12:59.360 --> 1:13:03.840]  That's why the New World Order is instituting race war and division and telling the people
[1:13:03.840 --> 1:13:09.200]  that rebellion is about overthrowing your local police and government and destroying
[1:13:09.200 --> 1:13:11.160]  essential services.
[1:13:11.160 --> 1:13:15.200]  This is an attempt to have society collapse.
[1:13:15.200 --> 1:13:18.440]  And the globalists, as they've done in the third world, will come in and pick up the
[1:13:18.440 --> 1:13:19.440]  pieces.
[1:13:19.440 --> 1:13:24.880]  We must stand against the UN, the IMF, the World Bank, and the EU openly saying defund
[1:13:24.880 --> 1:13:25.880]  the police.
[1:13:25.880 --> 1:13:27.360]  The police have a lot of problems.
[1:13:27.360 --> 1:13:28.720]  We all have a lot of problems.
[1:13:28.720 --> 1:13:31.480]  But this is our government and our local vocabulary.
[1:13:31.480 --> 1:13:36.160]  And believe me, once the globalists have overthrown this country, they're going to put in a real
[1:13:36.160 --> 1:13:38.400]  police state where you have no due process or freedom.
[1:13:38.400 --> 1:13:42.200]  The globalists believe Communist China is the model of the world.
[1:13:42.200 --> 1:13:44.320]  And they are orchestrating this entire thing.
[1:13:44.320 --> 1:13:48.840]  The people helping them are collaborators and are idiots and must be opposed.
[1:13:48.840 --> 1:13:50.840]  Infowars.com.
[1:13:50.840 --> 1:13:54.800]  Aerodyne Technology Delivery System.
[1:13:54.800 --> 1:14:00.840]  The first of its kind, pure, nascent atomic iodine that can be delivered through a spray
[1:14:00.840 --> 1:14:01.840]  bottle.
[1:14:01.840 --> 1:14:07.440]  The next level of innovation of X2 is here, introducing Survival Shield X2 Spray.
[1:14:07.440 --> 1:14:10.600]  The great part about the X2 Spray is it's great on the go.
[1:14:10.600 --> 1:14:14.720]  When you've got it in the dropper, it's great at your house, it's great at work, but this
[1:14:14.720 --> 1:14:18.000]  is great for the car, it's great to keep with you.
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:22.640]  And again, it's also good for the throat and mouth to get the effects of iodine, not to
[1:14:22.640 --> 1:14:24.160]  just ingest it into the stomach.
[1:14:24.160 --> 1:14:25.680]  We're really excited about it.
[1:14:25.680 --> 1:14:27.800]  It's 33% off out of the gates.
[1:14:27.800 --> 1:14:32.280]  It was listeners' idea asking for us to come up with a spray bottle that had us talk to
[1:14:32.280 --> 1:14:36.320]  the scientists and developers and come up with a system that aerosolizes it and delivers
[1:14:36.320 --> 1:14:39.840]  it to the body in a new and in some ways, even better way.
[1:14:39.840 --> 1:14:46.040]  Get your Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine spray now at 33% off at infowarstore.com and
[1:14:46.040 --> 1:14:54.720]  experience the power of aerosolized X2 nascent iodine for yourself.
[1:14:54.720 --> 1:15:09.000]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  Live from the infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show and now your
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:18.800]  host, David Knight.
[1:15:18.800 --> 1:15:26.160]  All right, we've got some amazing stories coming out of this China-India thing.
[1:15:26.160 --> 1:15:28.320]  I have to read the details of what happened there.
[1:15:28.320 --> 1:15:36.320]  And it's kind of like I-Station Zebra, except it was in the Himalayas, a big conflict there.
[1:15:36.320 --> 1:15:41.120]  Very interesting what happened, and of course we've got a lot of updates as to what is happening
[1:15:41.120 --> 1:15:44.040]  in terms of violence across the country as well.
[1:15:44.040 --> 1:15:48.240]  I've got a couple more things I want to say about mask, and I want to go to its follow-through,
[1:15:48.240 --> 1:15:53.640]  which is the vaccine, because some very troubling things are happening in the vaccines.
[1:15:53.640 --> 1:15:56.080]  The first people that are going to get it, that are already bragging, are going to be
[1:15:56.080 --> 1:15:57.080]  the military.
[1:15:57.080 --> 1:16:01.640]  We're going to make sure we take care of the military, got to give them the vaccine first,
[1:16:01.640 --> 1:16:03.480]  make them the guinea pigs.
[1:16:03.480 --> 1:16:09.320]  And as we're trying to sell this to getting black participants to volunteer for the vaccine,
[1:16:09.320 --> 1:16:13.080]  they're saying, this will only work if we get black people to volunteer for this.
[1:16:13.080 --> 1:16:17.760]  And the black people are saying, wait a minute, I remember those Tuskegee experiments that
[1:16:17.760 --> 1:16:18.760]  you did.
[1:16:18.760 --> 1:16:20.240]  I'm not so sure that I trust the government.
[1:16:20.240 --> 1:16:24.320]  Yeah, it's just the young white liberals who trust the government so much that they
[1:16:24.320 --> 1:16:28.600]  are willing to turn themselves into guinea pigs.
[1:16:28.600 --> 1:16:33.200]  Kind of the Darwin Award winners as we look at this.
[1:16:33.200 --> 1:16:36.240]  Anyway, before we do, real quickly, I want to remind you about some of the products that
[1:16:36.240 --> 1:16:39.560]  we have at infowarstore.com, because that's what supports this program and everything
[1:16:39.560 --> 1:16:41.080]  that we do.
[1:16:41.080 --> 1:16:42.680]  And of course, I work here as well.
[1:16:42.680 --> 1:16:47.040]  I have a morning program before this program every day, Money Through Friday.
[1:16:47.040 --> 1:16:51.200]  You can find it from 9 to noon Eastern time.
[1:16:51.200 --> 1:16:55.480]  And everything that we do is supported by the products that we sell at infowarstore.com.
[1:16:55.480 --> 1:17:01.400]  And that's a good thing, because as you see what's happening with zero hedge and with
[1:17:01.400 --> 1:17:07.480]  the Federalist, as Google is trying to shut them down by removing ads being put on their
[1:17:07.480 --> 1:17:16.280]  websites, it is, I'm really glad that Alex set up this model to support the company.
[1:17:16.280 --> 1:17:21.040]  We take donations and a lot of people operate on donations, a lot of people operate on ads
[1:17:21.040 --> 1:17:22.960]  that they sell as a free thing.
[1:17:22.960 --> 1:17:27.320]  We decided that we wanted to put out products to help you to prepare for this very thing
[1:17:27.320 --> 1:17:28.880]  that's happening right now.
[1:17:28.880 --> 1:17:36.920]  Prepare your help, prepare to make sure that you don't have to go to the government handout
[1:17:36.920 --> 1:17:41.560]  agencies when they shut down the food supply, or that you have to go to these grocery stores
[1:17:41.560 --> 1:17:43.360]  as crazy as they get.
[1:17:43.360 --> 1:17:45.600]  Make sure you've got food.
[1:17:45.600 --> 1:17:49.600]  And so we have our storeable food right now, it's the shortest lead time that we've had
[1:17:49.600 --> 1:17:52.480]  in months at infowarstore.com.
[1:17:52.480 --> 1:17:57.880]  Make sure that you're prepared, lock in the price, because we may see food prices go up
[1:17:57.880 --> 1:18:00.240]  if the economy does not come back.
[1:18:00.240 --> 1:18:03.840]  That's why they're going to be bringing back this lockdown.
[1:18:03.840 --> 1:18:10.920]  They've paused it so they can engage in some fun and games looting and burning and a different
[1:18:10.920 --> 1:18:12.760]  aspect of fear.
[1:18:12.760 --> 1:18:17.520]  Try to push the Civil War, and let me tell you, people are locked down, everyone is getting
[1:18:17.520 --> 1:18:20.360]  very edgy, and they're exploiting that.
[1:18:20.360 --> 1:18:23.280]  So make sure that you've got food at the very least.
[1:18:23.280 --> 1:18:29.680]  And again, our lead time is getting much shorter now, so take advantage of that.
[1:18:29.680 --> 1:18:35.000]  We've got all info wars shirts available at cost, $9.95, and then we've got some great
[1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:41.760]  discounts on things like our eight-pack power stack, 70% off, and that eight-pack power
[1:18:41.760 --> 1:18:46.760]  stack has got a lot of different supplements, and we kind of divide it into morning and
[1:18:46.760 --> 1:18:47.760]  evening supplements.
[1:18:47.760 --> 1:18:53.000]  We have things for the morning that are going to help you to wake up, to focus, to be alert,
[1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:57.480]  and in the evening, the supplements will help you to relax and to get to sleep naturally.
[1:18:57.480 --> 1:19:01.040]  We have some natural nutraceuticals.
[1:19:01.040 --> 1:19:06.680]  Those are things that are not pharmaceuticals, they are based on food, but they have a medicinal
[1:19:06.680 --> 1:19:11.240]  effect, very well-known natural products that are going to help you to relax, help you
[1:19:11.240 --> 1:19:13.160]  to get to sleep at night.
[1:19:13.160 --> 1:19:18.120]  We also have 60% off many other items like Brainforce Plus, my favorite supplement, Biotru
[1:19:18.120 --> 1:19:19.120]  Selenium.
[1:19:19.120 --> 1:19:25.080]  Selenium is a very essential mineral that you should have, and the question is getting
[1:19:25.080 --> 1:19:26.080]  a good source.
[1:19:26.080 --> 1:19:31.560]  And so our source, we call it Biotru because it's non-GMO, it's organic, our Biotru Selenium,
[1:19:31.560 --> 1:19:35.560]  and it's now 60% off many other products as well at infowarsstore.com.
[1:19:35.560 --> 1:19:40.440]  All right, I was just talking about how all these Democrat mayors are begging Governor
[1:19:40.440 --> 1:19:47.000]  Abbott to allow them to be able to force people to wear face masks, and he says, no, we're
[1:19:47.000 --> 1:19:49.760]  going to tell people that we think it's a good idea if they do, but we're not going
[1:19:49.760 --> 1:19:50.760]  to force them to do that.
[1:19:50.760 --> 1:19:56.760]  Nevertheless, in Travis County here, they have the county commissioners, again, all
[1:19:56.760 --> 1:20:01.880]  Democrats, they unanimously voted to pass an ordinance that would require face masks
[1:20:01.880 --> 1:20:06.840]  at county facilities, or they can charge you with trespassing.
[1:20:06.840 --> 1:20:15.960]  So they're always going to come up with some kind of a way to work around the authorities
[1:20:15.960 --> 1:20:17.120]  that try to give us freedom.
[1:20:17.120 --> 1:20:20.480]  And you know, the major authority that gives us freedom?
[1:20:20.480 --> 1:20:21.480]  The Constitution.
[1:20:21.480 --> 1:20:25.560]  That's really the one that supports our God-given rights.
[1:20:25.560 --> 1:20:26.560]  It doesn't give us any rights.
[1:20:26.560 --> 1:20:29.640]  It just says, no, they have these rights, and you're not going to take them from people,
[1:20:29.640 --> 1:20:31.480]  just like Governor Abbott said about the masks.
[1:20:31.480 --> 1:20:33.840]  But they'll find a way to try to get around that.
[1:20:33.840 --> 1:20:40.000]  And in Arizona, the Republican governor there, Governor Ducey, a Republican governor, has
[1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:43.320]  just announced that he's going to do what Governor Abbott would not do.
[1:20:43.320 --> 1:20:50.960]  He's going to give local governments the ability to set their face mask mandates, and they
[1:20:50.960 --> 1:20:52.520]  were eager to take them up on it.
[1:20:52.520 --> 1:20:57.400]  So here in Texas, you had eight cities get together and write a letter to Governor Abbott
[1:20:57.400 --> 1:21:00.280]  and say, well, you want to force people to wear masks, and he says, I'm not going to
[1:21:00.280 --> 1:21:01.280]  let you do that.
[1:21:01.280 --> 1:21:04.360]  I'm not going to let you arrest people for not wearing a mask.
[1:21:04.360 --> 1:21:07.360]  I can't breathe.
[1:21:07.360 --> 1:21:08.520]  That's what you should have on your mask.
[1:21:08.520 --> 1:21:09.520]  I can't breathe.
[1:21:09.520 --> 1:21:18.040]  But the, just an aside here, we were driving around through Wednesday and there was a bunch
[1:21:18.040 --> 1:21:23.720]  of college kids with masks on doing, I can't breathe, I can't breathe.
[1:21:23.720 --> 1:21:30.360]  And I came so close to yelling out, take your masks off then, but I would have gotten something
[1:21:30.360 --> 1:21:33.960]  out of my car, I'm sure.
[1:21:33.960 --> 1:21:36.920]  Sometimes discretion is advised.
[1:21:36.920 --> 1:21:41.880]  But anyway, in Texas, Governor Abbott said no to those eight cities, but in Arizona,
[1:21:41.880 --> 1:21:45.040]  the Republican governor there, Ducey said yes, and so now you've got eight cities like
[1:21:45.040 --> 1:21:50.200]  Phoenix, Tucson, Scottsdale, and so forth, Mesa, Chandler, all going to start requiring
[1:21:50.200 --> 1:21:51.200]  people to wear masks.
[1:21:51.200 --> 1:21:55.880]  So, as I said, you've got this big propaganda campaign going on simultaneously, just they're
[1:21:55.880 --> 1:22:04.160]  all doing the same article all at the same time, LA Times, NBC News, USA Today, you got
[1:22:04.160 --> 1:22:07.200]  to wear the mask.
[1:22:07.200 --> 1:22:10.720]  And even this headline here from NBC News, I like this, Necessary or Needless, and as
[1:22:10.720 --> 1:22:15.000]  I said, they've got a picture of a real pretty young nurse, and she says like, you really
[1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:16.440]  want to argue with this with me?
[1:22:16.440 --> 1:22:17.440]  I'm a nurse.
[1:22:17.440 --> 1:22:20.320]  Well, I don't know.
[1:22:20.320 --> 1:22:22.680]  Let's ask the real experts, right?
[1:22:22.680 --> 1:22:30.040]  Let's ask Tony Fauci, or we could ask Jerome Adams, the U.S. search in general.
[1:22:30.040 --> 1:22:32.080]  They've been of two minds, haven't they?
[1:22:32.080 --> 1:22:36.000]  Well, no, actually, Fauci said, I was lying to people at the beginning when I told them
[1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:37.160]  that they didn't need to wear masks.
[1:22:37.160 --> 1:22:40.040]  I'm telling you, you've got to wear the mask.
[1:22:40.040 --> 1:22:45.440]  No, actually, Fauci was saying, yeah, we had those N95 masks.
[1:22:45.440 --> 1:22:49.840]  I didn't want them to wear those N95, we had to save those for our heroes, so you people
[1:22:49.840 --> 1:22:50.840]  can die.
[1:22:50.840 --> 1:22:55.040]  Well, Fauci, now that we're all told that we've got to wear masks, we can wear scarves
[1:22:55.040 --> 1:23:00.080]  or bandanas, I had a story sent to me from one of the listeners, if you want to send
[1:23:00.080 --> 1:23:01.080]  me stories.
[1:23:01.080 --> 1:23:05.120]  By the way, I'm on Twitter at Liberty Terrain.
[1:23:05.120 --> 1:23:07.640]  If you sign up, if you're following me, you might want to make sure that you're still
[1:23:07.640 --> 1:23:11.680]  following me because they will unfollow you.
[1:23:11.680 --> 1:23:12.760]  They did that to my wife.
[1:23:12.760 --> 1:23:17.600]  They kept hammering her to follow AOC.
[1:23:17.600 --> 1:23:21.400]  They could tell from her tweets, she's not an AOC type of person.
[1:23:21.400 --> 1:23:26.400]  So this is not about licking at any demographics, but they kept pushing that.
[1:23:26.400 --> 1:23:31.800]  Eventually, they told her, you don't want any notifications from me, from your husband.
[1:23:31.800 --> 1:23:33.920]  And eventually, they unfollowed her from me.
[1:23:33.920 --> 1:23:38.800]  But you'll see there where you can send me some news, as at the David Knight Show at
[1:23:38.800 --> 1:23:40.520]  protonmail.com.
[1:23:40.520 --> 1:23:43.960]  And by the way, I'll tell you what somebody said, a couple of amazing stories that people
[1:23:43.960 --> 1:23:48.760]  sent me, experiences that they had about masks when we come back, stay with us.

[1:24:49.400 --> 1:24:54.520]  It's finally here, introducing the first of its kind, nascent iodine spray with true atomic
[1:24:54.520 --> 1:24:55.520]  iodine.

[1:24:59.720 --> 1:25:01.920]  deep earth crystal nascent iodine.

[1:25:47.520 --> 1:25:48.520]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut.
[1:25:48.520 --> 1:25:49.520]  You're on the air.
[1:25:49.520 --> 1:25:50.520]  Thanks for holding.
[1:25:50.520 --> 1:25:51.520]  Hello.
[1:25:51.520 --> 1:25:52.520]  Can you hear me?
[1:25:52.520 --> 1:25:53.520]  I sure can, sir.
[1:25:53.520 --> 1:25:54.520]  Thank you.
[1:25:54.520 --> 1:25:55.520]  Hey, Alex.
[1:25:55.520 --> 1:26:01.040]  Before I start, man, I just wanted to talk to you, bro, and it's a pleasure to be talking
[1:26:01.040 --> 1:26:02.040]  right now with you, man.
[1:26:02.040 --> 1:26:04.040]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[1:26:04.040 --> 1:26:07.040]  I'm from New Brink, Connecticut, and I just want to plug in.
[1:26:07.040 --> 1:26:11.640]  I'm a truck driver, and two before us have changed the way I drive.
[1:26:11.640 --> 1:26:17.520]  Me and my brothers that drive, there's a couple of us, we're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto
[1:26:17.520 --> 1:26:18.520]  Ricans.
[1:26:18.520 --> 1:26:24.520]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and Rolla, and I have lost weight because I started
[1:26:24.520 --> 1:26:27.520]  drinking all that sugar, and I just want to thank you for that, man.
[1:26:27.520 --> 1:26:31.960]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term, high-quality energy powder
[1:26:31.960 --> 1:26:35.240]  there is, so this was designed by one of the top guys in the country.
[1:26:35.240 --> 1:26:38.240]  He didn't want his name on it because obviously the political issues, but we had to pay a
[1:26:38.240 --> 1:26:41.560]  lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it, and we believe it is the
[1:26:41.560 --> 1:26:45.720]  best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there, and you're saying that it's made your
[1:26:45.720 --> 1:26:46.960]  life better, so that means a lot to me.
[1:26:46.960 --> 1:26:48.360]  Thank you to all your truck drivers.
[1:26:48.360 --> 1:26:52.120]  We love you.
[1:26:52.120 --> 1:26:59.120]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:26:59.120 --> 1:27:17.120]  All right, so our masks, necessary needle list, we've been called both by Fauci.
[1:27:17.120 --> 1:27:22.080]  We lied to people, he said, well, we didn't have enough N95 masks, but now you can wear
[1:27:22.080 --> 1:27:27.240]  a bandana, and we had bandanas back then, so why was he lying to us if it's necessary
[1:27:27.240 --> 1:27:28.240]  and safe?
[1:27:28.240 --> 1:27:32.920]  I mean, he's needlessly putting us at risk, and we've seen the surgeon general, Jerome
[1:27:32.920 --> 1:27:36.640]  Adams, going from, no, no, no, you don't want to wear it.
[1:27:36.640 --> 1:27:44.480]  It actually makes things worse, which is actually a lot of doctors have told us that, and for
[1:27:44.480 --> 1:27:49.000]  the reasons that I already mentioned, but then he went from that to, well, no, you should
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:54.600]  wear them, you must wear them, wear them, because it is a sign of your freedom.
[1:27:54.600 --> 1:27:57.360]  That's where our U.S. Surgeon General, Jerome Adams, is.
[1:27:57.360 --> 1:28:00.400]  Let me tell you, we don't even need a surgeon general.
[1:28:00.400 --> 1:28:01.400]  What?
[1:28:01.400 --> 1:28:03.120]  What is a surgeon general anyway?
[1:28:03.120 --> 1:28:10.840]  Yes, yes, Jerome Adams, he is the very model of a modern surgeon general, and he is a useless
[1:28:10.840 --> 1:28:15.280]  appendage that needs to be amputated, along with the rest of the office there.
[1:28:15.280 --> 1:28:21.400]  But let me tell you what they're not telling you, as they got the war on hydroxychloroquine,
[1:28:21.400 --> 1:28:26.960]  it's not just a war on hydroxychloroquine, it's the war on every other alternative treatment.
[1:28:26.960 --> 1:28:31.320]  We have the U.K. public health bodies are reviewing vitamin Ds, efficacy in fighting
[1:28:31.320 --> 1:28:32.320]  coronavirus.
[1:28:32.320 --> 1:28:38.240]  Coronavirus is a class of viruses, the common cold and flu belong to that class of viruses,
[1:28:38.240 --> 1:28:40.440]  and yes, guess what?
[1:28:40.440 --> 1:28:42.800]  Vitamin D has always been very effective.
[1:28:42.800 --> 1:28:47.320]  As a matter of fact, you had a former head of the CDC and a guy who's currently working
[1:28:47.320 --> 1:28:50.880]  for the NIH, Fauci's organization, both of them.
[1:28:50.880 --> 1:28:55.640]  I said when I talked about this, or winter sun, you know, we sell a supplement, vitamin
[1:28:55.640 --> 1:29:00.880]  D, it's weight listed right now because it is a very important thing to have for a lot
[1:29:00.880 --> 1:29:02.760]  of different reasons.
[1:29:02.760 --> 1:29:04.360]  I mean, it is actually a hormone.
[1:29:04.360 --> 1:29:07.760]  If you don't get out in the sun, where your body can make the vitamin D, you need to be
[1:29:07.760 --> 1:29:12.360]  making that because it helps your body's immune system, and that's exactly what the
[1:29:12.360 --> 1:29:16.760]  NIH and CDC officials were saying.
[1:29:16.760 --> 1:29:18.160]  So is this news?
[1:29:18.160 --> 1:29:21.320]  Is it news that intravenous vitamin C is very helpful?
[1:29:21.320 --> 1:29:24.760]  Is it news to you that stem cells were found in China?
[1:29:24.760 --> 1:29:33.080]  They had nine elderly people that were nearly dead from the COVID-19, and they gave them
[1:29:33.080 --> 1:29:38.480]  stem cells, not taken from aborted babies, but stem cells that were taken from umbilical
[1:29:38.480 --> 1:29:39.480]  cords.
[1:29:39.480 --> 1:29:44.560]  And they found that all nine people, 100%, yes, it's a small study, but, you know, we
[1:29:44.560 --> 1:29:51.320]  have the standard of care that's being sold to everybody by Fauci, Remdesivir, by Gilead.
[1:29:51.320 --> 1:29:53.640]  It's got to be, he's got to have some financial ties to this company.
[1:29:53.640 --> 1:29:59.360]  I mean, he has pushed that company for every one of his fake pandemics.
[1:29:59.360 --> 1:30:05.520]  And going all the way back to AIDS, he was pushing Remdesivir as a treatment for AIDS.
[1:30:05.520 --> 1:30:09.240]  And they found, well, it's actually got some very, very nasty side effects besides the
[1:30:09.240 --> 1:30:10.880]  fact that it'll bankrupt you.
[1:30:10.880 --> 1:30:15.200]  It's got a lot of nasty side effects, and it didn't work.
[1:30:15.200 --> 1:30:19.120]  He pushed it again with Ebola.
[1:30:19.120 --> 1:30:22.400]  Now he's pushing it again, saying it's a standard of care, and it is not.
[1:30:22.400 --> 1:30:28.400]  The studies are not there, but when you talk about these other studies, stem cells, again,
[1:30:28.400 --> 1:30:32.360]  they found that it not only cured 100% of the people, but it also repaired damage to
[1:30:32.360 --> 1:30:33.360]  their lungs.
[1:30:33.360 --> 1:30:37.920]  But of course, don't tell people that, because they don't want anybody to know about how
[1:30:37.920 --> 1:30:42.600]  effective stem cells are until they can come up with some way to patent it, preferably
[1:30:42.600 --> 1:30:46.160]  by cell lines taken from aborted babies.
[1:30:46.160 --> 1:30:49.200]  That's really what they can patent, and that's why they're pushing this off.
[1:30:49.200 --> 1:30:54.480]  And you know, it's the Trump administration, FDA is out of control.
[1:30:54.480 --> 1:30:57.760]  The FDA under President Trump is out of control, and it's not his people.
[1:30:57.760 --> 1:31:00.960]  These are carryovers, permanent bureaucrats that are there.
[1:31:00.960 --> 1:31:04.720]  But again, President Trump is responsible for not doing anything to pull this back.
[1:31:04.720 --> 1:31:10.800]  The FDA, under President Trump, has banned certain types of stem cell treatments using
[1:31:10.800 --> 1:31:13.440]  your own stem cells.
[1:31:13.440 --> 1:31:23.920]  They have also tried to ban vaping, and they want to ban salad bars and buffets because
[1:31:23.920 --> 1:31:25.160]  of COVID-19.
[1:31:25.160 --> 1:31:30.080]  These people are on a power trip, every bit as bad as any Democrat may or anywhere.
[1:31:30.080 --> 1:31:32.000]  They've got to be put under control.
[1:31:32.000 --> 1:31:34.760]  But they don't want you to know about Intervenous Vitamin C, they don't want you to know about
[1:31:34.760 --> 1:31:39.800]  stem cells, they don't want you to know about another very old drug, a steroid, that was
[1:31:39.800 --> 1:31:43.520]  just recently found to be very effective of people who were at advanced stages of this.
[1:31:43.520 --> 1:31:46.880]  But they don't want you to know about hydroxychloroquine, and when I look at this story that's being
[1:31:46.880 --> 1:31:54.280]  put out by CNN, US has a stockpile, and now we're stuck with 63 million doses of hydroxychloroquine.
[1:31:54.280 --> 1:32:02.520]  Well, maybe we can find a use for those, because they're not useless simply because the FDA
[1:32:02.520 --> 1:32:06.440]  has revoked its emergency permission to use that.
[1:32:06.440 --> 1:32:09.080]  I mean, why are we politicizing this?
[1:32:09.080 --> 1:32:11.720]  We've got a lot of doctors who have experience.
[1:32:11.720 --> 1:32:14.520]  You don't listen to the doctors, you're going to listen to the beer crafts in Washington?
[1:32:14.520 --> 1:32:17.920]  We've got a lot of doctors that say this is very effective, and of course it's effective
[1:32:17.920 --> 1:32:24.560]  when they do it in conjunction with zinc, and they don't do that.
[1:32:24.560 --> 1:32:30.520]  But this is being put in, you know, all of this revocation of the use of hydroxychloroquine,
[1:32:30.520 --> 1:32:38.120]  the CNN story never mentions the fake story from Lancet, the UK Journal of Medicine, which
[1:32:38.120 --> 1:32:39.120]  they retracted.
[1:32:39.120 --> 1:32:40.360]  Why did they retract it?
[1:32:40.360 --> 1:32:44.680]  Because the people who put this thing together not only rigged it, could not include zinc,
[1:32:44.680 --> 1:32:49.440]  but they also wouldn't show their data.
[1:32:49.440 --> 1:32:54.280]  And just like I said, this is, I've seen this pattern before, this is why I never bought
[1:32:54.280 --> 1:32:58.400]  into this from the beginning, because I've seen these people do exactly the same thing
[1:32:58.400 --> 1:32:59.920]  with the climate change stuff.
[1:32:59.920 --> 1:33:07.440]  I was part of a group that sued in the wake of Climate Gate, where they were exchanging
[1:33:07.440 --> 1:33:14.360]  emails with the University of East Anglia, and Michael Mann, the guy who invented the
[1:33:14.360 --> 1:33:20.080]  idea of the hockey stick, you know, the COT was going to go up exponentially, and so is
[1:33:20.080 --> 1:33:25.040]  the temperature, they're going to be tied directly to each other, that's absolute nonsense.
[1:33:25.040 --> 1:33:27.560]  And as these people are passing notes back and forth to each other, saying we've got
[1:33:27.560 --> 1:33:31.640]  to hide the decline, our models aren't working, and so forth, we try to get their data.
[1:33:31.640 --> 1:33:37.360]  So that shows your data, you put the data together when you're working for a university,
[1:33:37.360 --> 1:33:44.600]  they paid you for it, it was done on university time, you have published the data, and the
[1:33:44.600 --> 1:33:49.760]  data has been used for public policy, and now we'd like to see that data, so we can
[1:33:49.760 --> 1:33:50.760]  review it.
[1:33:50.760 --> 1:33:54.320]  Not going to show it to you, fought us in court, and won in the court.
[1:33:54.320 --> 1:33:59.040]  Court said, no, no, that's privileged information, yeah, we know why it's privileged, because
[1:33:59.040 --> 1:34:04.280]  it would show it was a lie, just like it was exposed in this Landsat story about hydroxychloroquine
[1:34:04.280 --> 1:34:06.120]  was a lie, but it's all about politics.
[1:34:06.120 --> 1:34:10.120]  We've got to, for two reasons, they've got to attack Trump, and they've got to make
[1:34:10.120 --> 1:34:13.720]  sure that you don't know anything about any of these effective treatments, so they can
[1:34:13.720 --> 1:34:16.000]  keep this going.
[1:34:16.000 --> 1:34:21.600]  Which brings us to the vaccines, NBC News says a COVID-19 vaccine will work only if the trials
[1:34:21.600 --> 1:34:24.240]  include black participants.
[1:34:24.240 --> 1:34:31.040]  So go ahead, roll up your sleeve, it's time for that sole vaccination, power power, yeah,
[1:34:31.040 --> 1:34:34.640]  roll up your, if you ain't got it, you might just be getting the disease, persuade black
[1:34:34.640 --> 1:34:39.400]  people who have a deep mistrust of experimental drugs and medical institutions, they've got
[1:34:39.400 --> 1:34:44.440]  to do this to participate in clinical trials, they said African Americans have been disproportionately
[1:34:44.440 --> 1:34:48.360]  affected by COVID-19, and we know this, of course, because of CDC statistics, and they
[1:34:48.360 --> 1:34:50.720]  never lie.
[1:34:50.720 --> 1:34:56.600]  They never say that somebody died of COVID-19 without even knowing if they died with it.
[1:34:56.600 --> 1:35:00.000]  So we've gone down that road many times, I won't plow that field again.
[1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:06.320]  They stress the medicine could produce different results based on race and genetic background,
[1:35:06.320 --> 1:35:08.880]  and that's exactly what the black people are concerned about, because you know they know
[1:35:08.880 --> 1:35:15.920]  about this, the Tuskegee experiments, she says, yeah, that's a real problem, I've got
[1:35:15.920 --> 1:35:22.520]  to, people keep mentioning that to me when I go around and try to sign them up as volunteers.
[1:35:22.520 --> 1:35:27.040]  And the government has been doing a lot of that stuff, quite frankly, but it's not going
[1:35:27.040 --> 1:35:32.120]  to be the black people are going to be the first guinea pigs, it's going to be U.S. military.
[1:35:32.120 --> 1:35:36.480]  Military.com, U.S. troops would be among the first to get a working COVID-19 vaccine,
[1:35:36.480 --> 1:35:37.480]  say officials.
[1:35:37.480 --> 1:35:38.480]  Isn't that nice?
[1:35:38.480 --> 1:35:42.200]  That's an extra benefit, apparently, from military.com.
[1:35:42.200 --> 1:35:45.840]  They're not saying this is a bad thing, right, because they've said in the past, well, you
[1:35:45.840 --> 1:35:52.880]  know, if China, Fauci's like saying, China gets the vaccine first, we're going to make
[1:35:52.880 --> 1:35:55.600]  sure that they share it with us.
[1:35:55.600 --> 1:36:02.200]  Yeah, well, okay, China can have all the vaccines they want as far as I'm concerned.
[1:36:02.200 --> 1:36:08.240]  What concerns me is that we've paid $1.2 billion to AstraZeneca to make sure that they can
[1:36:08.240 --> 1:36:13.240]  manufacture 300 million doses of whatever this Frankenstein contraption is that they
[1:36:13.240 --> 1:36:19.320]  are putting out there, and we've got legislatures like Virginia, Colorado laying the foundation
[1:36:19.320 --> 1:36:25.200]  to force you to take mandatory vaccines, and you've got lawyers like Alan Dershowitz
[1:36:25.200 --> 1:36:31.200]  lining up to argue before the Supreme Court that you have no right to refuse that.
[1:36:31.200 --> 1:36:33.360]  This is why we need to keep our guns, folks.
[1:36:33.360 --> 1:36:34.360]  We'll be right back.
[1:36:34.360 --> 1:36:35.360]  Stay with us.
[1:36:35.360 --> 1:36:54.160]  United Nations is publicly depopulating Africa and many other third-world sectors of the
[1:36:54.160 --> 1:36:55.160]  world.
[1:36:55.160 --> 1:37:01.640]  Bill and Melinda Gates that control the UNWHO openly say they want to depopulate brown people.
[1:37:01.640 --> 1:37:08.560]  It is absurdist that Apple and Google and Nike have slave factories in China, the worst
[1:37:08.560 --> 1:37:13.080]  on the planet, and then lecture white people in America how they're bad to black people.
[1:37:13.080 --> 1:37:18.080]  Now, all of the world, people are taking knees trying to overthrow police and put leftists
[1:37:18.080 --> 1:37:19.480]  in control.
[1:37:19.480 --> 1:37:22.520]  This is a totally sickening, disgusting joke.
[1:37:22.520 --> 1:37:26.600]  You ever heard the saying, keep your friends close, enemies closer?
[1:37:26.600 --> 1:37:29.080]  Leftists are evil, and they divide and conquer people.
[1:37:29.080 --> 1:37:34.760]  But at the heart of them is a eugenics-based depopulation operation.
[1:37:34.760 --> 1:37:39.360]  Why aren't Black Lives Matter and Cold Springs Harbor in New York where they run the whole
[1:37:39.360 --> 1:37:41.560]  operation trying to topple statues?
[1:37:41.560 --> 1:37:43.720]  Why aren't they at the United Nations?
[1:37:43.720 --> 1:37:48.600]  Because they're controlled by the UN and being directed by their masters.
[1:37:48.600 --> 1:37:57.200]  It's finally here, introducing the new survival shield X2 Spray, available now for 33% off
[1:37:57.200 --> 1:38:01.120]  at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:38:01.120 --> 1:38:07.560]  Listeners have been asking us for months to develop an iodine spray made with our exclusive

[1:38:49.040 --> 1:38:55.000]  We were told by the United Nations, we were told by the CDC and Fauci that two plus million
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:39:00.560]  Americans would die, that millions of Europeans would die, that we did not do exactly as they
[1:39:00.560 --> 1:39:01.560]  said.
[1:39:01.560 --> 1:39:03.040]  And it turned out it was all frauds.
[1:39:03.040 --> 1:39:08.640]  The models, the testing, taking regular depths and putting it in the COVID-19 column, all
[1:39:08.640 --> 1:39:12.560]  a complete criminal fraud, but none of them are getting sued, none of them are getting
[1:39:12.560 --> 1:39:17.080]  prosecuted, none of them are getting in trouble except for Bill Gates, the FDA, shut down
[1:39:17.080 --> 1:39:22.000]  his factories that are making fake COVID tests that show everyone is positive.
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:26.600]  And despite that, they're still testing record numbers of people, creating hysteria and saying
[1:39:26.600 --> 1:39:32.200]  the numbers spiking and why it will be 200,000 dead by the election, and it's all Trump's
[1:39:32.200 --> 1:39:33.200]  fault.
[1:39:33.200 --> 1:39:37.400]  And now, oh, China had 40 cases in one city, we've got to lock down again, everything's
[1:39:37.400 --> 1:39:38.400]  over.
[1:39:38.400 --> 1:39:41.800]  And this, ladies and gentlemen, is the new order teaching us to be total prisoners.
[1:39:41.800 --> 1:39:50.040]  Either we expose the COVID hoax or all permanently enslaved by it, your choice.
[1:39:50.040 --> 1:39:59.560]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy and overall wellness.
[1:39:59.560 --> 1:40:07.320]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date, super male vitality, specifically
[1:40:07.320 --> 1:40:14.320]  designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality
[1:40:14.320 --> 1:40:15.320]  in males.
[1:40:15.320 --> 1:40:21.320]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses, and it contains
[1:40:21.320 --> 1:40:25.960]  no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[1:40:25.960 --> 1:40:26.960]  Yes.
[1:40:26.960 --> 1:40:33.600]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology, working together in
[1:40:33.600 --> 1:40:38.600]  perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[1:40:38.600 --> 1:40:40.200]  So what are you waiting for?
[1:40:40.200 --> 1:40:42.200]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[1:40:42.200 --> 1:40:45.120]  Never been a better time than right now.
[1:40:45.120 --> 1:40:52.120]  Super male vitality at InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:40:52.120 --> 1:41:07.120]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:41:07.120 --> 1:41:18.480]  All right, so Joy Behar is saying the Trump rally is 10 times worse health risk than the
[1:41:18.480 --> 1:41:19.480]  BLM protests.
[1:41:19.480 --> 1:41:24.540]  That's not about a disease, folks.
[1:41:24.540 --> 1:41:26.040]  This is simply politics.
[1:41:26.040 --> 1:41:31.320]  And of course, you have Dr. Fauci when he asked if he would attend President Trump's
[1:41:31.320 --> 1:41:32.320]  Tulsa rally.
[1:41:32.320 --> 1:41:33.560]  He says, of course not.
[1:41:33.560 --> 1:41:37.320]  We haven't gotten out of our first wave yet, right?
[1:41:37.320 --> 1:41:41.560]  The second wave is coming, and the third wave, and the fourth wave, we've got to wave these
[1:41:41.560 --> 1:41:42.560]  people goodbye.
[1:41:42.560 --> 1:41:50.040]  Look, the Trump people are not doing anybody a favor by going through the motions of pretending
[1:41:50.040 --> 1:41:54.040]  that Fauci has got a leg to stand on with this stuff.
[1:41:54.040 --> 1:41:58.600]  I mean, the whole thing that he's sold, President, that garbage that he's sold, two million people
[1:41:58.600 --> 1:42:00.960]  going to die.
[1:42:00.960 --> 1:42:05.640]  That was based on a simulation that even before that was sold to people.
[1:42:05.640 --> 1:42:10.360]  University of Edinburgh looked at that Imperial College of London study and said, you run
[1:42:10.360 --> 1:42:16.440]  their computer model, and you get a different answer every time with the same inputs.
[1:42:16.440 --> 1:42:22.320]  Now, understand, with a computer model, you're going to run random inputs through it to try
[1:42:22.320 --> 1:42:25.960]  to see over a range of values what kind of stuff it's going to get out.
[1:42:25.960 --> 1:42:26.960]  We're not talking about that.
[1:42:26.960 --> 1:42:32.960]  We're talking about putting in the same number in front and getting out different answers
[1:42:32.960 --> 1:42:39.000]  out the back end, which means it's an absolute piece of garbage that was written in FORTRAN,
[1:42:39.000 --> 1:42:41.160]  like 15,000 lines of code in FORTRAN.
[1:42:41.160 --> 1:42:44.560]  They deliberately did that so they could blame it on bad code.
[1:42:44.560 --> 1:42:48.240]  I mean, they actually told the University of Edinburgh, well, run it on a slower computer.
[1:42:48.240 --> 1:42:50.080]  They said, what are you talking about?
[1:42:50.080 --> 1:42:57.480]  That isn't going to change the fact that your software's got bugs on it.
[1:42:57.480 --> 1:43:03.920]  And beyond that, it was the implementation of the model, but the model itself was fundamentally
[1:43:03.920 --> 1:43:05.840]  flawed.
[1:43:05.840 --> 1:43:11.640]  As Ionitis, the epidemiologist at Stanford said from the very beginning, he said, they're
[1:43:11.640 --> 1:43:18.000]  making assumptions that people, this is going to affect, every person infected is going
[1:43:18.000 --> 1:43:21.040]  to infect another 2.3 people forever.
[1:43:21.040 --> 1:43:22.360]  That isn't the way any of this stuff works.
[1:43:22.360 --> 1:43:26.040]  We're talking about smallpox or we're talking about cholera or anything else.
[1:43:26.040 --> 1:43:33.280]  Going back to the 1840s, Ted, not Ted, Farr's Law, I knew what Ted Farr, Farr's Law, pointed
[1:43:33.280 --> 1:43:35.720]  out that you get that bell-shaped curve, that's what they were talking about.
[1:43:35.720 --> 1:43:38.420]  So he says, you're talking about people talking about flattening the curve, but that's not
[1:43:38.420 --> 1:43:39.420]  even in the model.
[1:43:39.420 --> 1:43:40.920]  It doesn't even have a curve.
[1:43:40.920 --> 1:43:46.160]  It's got a straight line going up because this is absolute garbage and the code is even
[1:43:46.160 --> 1:43:49.600]  worse and yet Fauci's not been discredited.
[1:43:49.600 --> 1:43:52.480]  We're still going with his guidelines and recommendations.
[1:43:52.480 --> 1:43:56.000]  He not only needs to be fired, he needs to be discredited.
[1:43:56.000 --> 1:43:58.080]  And let me tell you how this should look.
[1:43:58.080 --> 1:44:04.200]  Instead of the MAGA rally, having people wear masks and getting their temperatures taken,
[1:44:04.200 --> 1:44:08.040]  they ought to do what these legislators are doing in New York City.
[1:44:08.040 --> 1:44:11.080]  They said, enough is enough.
[1:44:11.080 --> 1:44:16.640]  As they were letting these people literally run riot in the city, the Blasio, he goes
[1:44:16.640 --> 1:44:21.240]  to the Jewish community to punish them because he's upset about the fact that they have been
[1:44:21.240 --> 1:44:24.920]  defying his lockdown and social distancing rules.
[1:44:24.920 --> 1:44:25.920]  They had a funeral.
[1:44:25.920 --> 1:44:26.920]  How dare them?
[1:44:26.920 --> 1:44:27.920]  I'm serious.
[1:44:27.920 --> 1:44:31.560]  I'm going to shut you guys down permanently so as to the synagogues and to the churches
[1:44:31.560 --> 1:44:33.640]  in New York City.
[1:44:33.640 --> 1:44:38.480]  And then because these people are talking back to him, he goes down to a playground and they
[1:44:38.480 --> 1:44:43.840]  literally put chains around the iron gates into the children's playground.
[1:44:43.840 --> 1:44:49.240]  So now you've got three lawmakers in New York City, went with an official and they cut the
[1:44:49.240 --> 1:44:54.760]  chains off of the gates there in Brooklyn in defiance of him.
[1:44:54.760 --> 1:44:58.080]  They said, enough is enough.
[1:44:58.080 --> 1:45:01.800]  They said that this tiny little oasis of joy is being withheld from the children of our
[1:45:01.800 --> 1:45:04.600]  community and enough is enough.
[1:45:04.600 --> 1:45:09.440]  If it was truly, truly the case that for public safety, for public health, parks had to be
[1:45:09.440 --> 1:45:13.520]  closed, then you would close all of the parks.
[1:45:13.520 --> 1:45:15.480]  But this is not the case.
[1:45:15.480 --> 1:45:18.000]  So let all the parks be open.
[1:45:18.000 --> 1:45:20.000]  The hypocrisy has to end.
[1:45:20.000 --> 1:45:22.200]  And it ends today right here at Cobare Park.
[1:45:22.200 --> 1:45:28.440]  So what they're doing is, not only is he saying, well, you can't, and these were typically
[1:45:28.440 --> 1:45:33.480]  young people who attended the funeral, they had masks on, the Blasio called the police
[1:45:33.480 --> 1:45:34.480]  out on him.
[1:45:34.480 --> 1:45:35.840]  He said, you can't do that.
[1:45:35.840 --> 1:45:37.960]  And then immediately he says, oh, but you can all go riot.
[1:45:37.960 --> 1:45:39.360]  You can do anything you want.
[1:45:39.360 --> 1:45:40.360]  Go for it.
[1:45:40.360 --> 1:45:41.360]  That's good.
[1:45:41.360 --> 1:45:42.360]  Love that.
[1:45:42.360 --> 1:45:47.880]  And then he locks down their park while he lets other parks stay open.
[1:45:47.880 --> 1:45:50.240]  They said, what are we waiting for?
[1:45:50.240 --> 1:45:51.240]  What are we waiting for?
[1:45:51.240 --> 1:45:52.600]  They said, to open these playgrounds.
[1:45:52.600 --> 1:45:55.320]  Are we waiting for some kid to run out in the street and get killed and finally say,
[1:45:55.320 --> 1:45:56.600]  oh, we should open the playgrounds?
[1:45:56.600 --> 1:45:58.560]  That doesn't make any sense.
[1:45:58.560 --> 1:46:03.800]  What President Trump needs to do is he needs to cut the chains that Fauci has put on our
[1:46:03.800 --> 1:46:07.000]  lives and he needs to get in his face.
[1:46:07.000 --> 1:46:12.880]  He needs to discredit him with some real experts, some real scientists who have been right from
[1:46:12.880 --> 1:46:17.480]  the beginning because it's not just these rules and regulations and guidelines that
[1:46:17.480 --> 1:46:20.240]  have to be cut.
[1:46:20.240 --> 1:46:25.080]  You have to cut the psychological chains that have been forged on people who are too afraid
[1:46:25.080 --> 1:46:27.200]  to go outside and yet they're still doing that.
[1:46:27.200 --> 1:46:29.280]  Keep your dog socially distanced now.
[1:46:29.280 --> 1:46:31.080]  They're still putting this out.
[1:46:31.080 --> 1:46:32.840]  I mean, we've been down this road.
[1:46:32.840 --> 1:46:36.440]  Remember, they put this out and they tried to scare people with the social distancing
[1:46:36.440 --> 1:46:37.600]  of your pets.
[1:46:37.600 --> 1:46:38.600]  You're going to get it from them.
[1:46:38.600 --> 1:46:40.000]  Then they came back and said, well, never mind.
[1:46:40.000 --> 1:46:41.000]  You're not going to get it from your pets.
[1:46:41.000 --> 1:46:42.800]  You're going to get it from touching things.
[1:46:42.800 --> 1:46:43.800]  Well, no, never mind.
[1:46:43.800 --> 1:46:46.240]  You're not going to get it from touching things until they say that you can.
[1:46:46.240 --> 1:46:50.800]  They're going to go back and forth, back and forth to create confusion and fear.
[1:46:50.800 --> 1:46:57.560]  These people have to be not only removed, but discredited, put them in the trash bin
[1:46:57.560 --> 1:47:02.320]  of junk science where they belong.
[1:47:02.320 --> 1:47:04.280]  And that brings us to the vaccines.
[1:47:04.280 --> 1:47:06.280]  You know, we look at the leading contender here.
[1:47:06.280 --> 1:47:12.560]  Why is Moderna given $456 million, a half a billion dollars to develop a vaccine?
[1:47:12.560 --> 1:47:15.600]  Well, it's because President Trump wanted it as quickly as possible.
[1:47:15.600 --> 1:47:17.280]  I don't care about the safety.
[1:47:17.280 --> 1:47:19.080]  I don't care about the efficacy.
[1:47:19.080 --> 1:47:25.200]  I don't care that they have never done a treatment for anything.
[1:47:25.200 --> 1:47:28.640]  They have a reckless business model.
[1:47:28.640 --> 1:47:30.840]  I wish Michael Crichton was still alive.
[1:47:30.840 --> 1:47:33.560]  Well, he would rip these people apart.
[1:47:33.560 --> 1:47:37.920]  That was a whole premise of Jurassic Park.
[1:47:37.920 --> 1:47:41.720]  Doing reckless things that you don't have any knowledge of what the outcome is going
[1:47:41.720 --> 1:47:42.720]  to be.
[1:47:42.720 --> 1:47:44.200]  And that's precisely the business model of Moderna.
[1:47:44.200 --> 1:47:48.440]  Of course, the real business model is to sell fictional narratives so they can raise a lot
[1:47:48.440 --> 1:47:51.400]  of money on Wall Street until they go to the White House and then they get a half a billion
[1:47:51.400 --> 1:47:53.200]  dollars.
[1:47:53.200 --> 1:47:56.600]  Because as President Trump went around the room, well, it's going to take us a couple
[1:47:56.600 --> 1:47:57.600]  of years to do a vaccine.
[1:47:57.600 --> 1:47:59.960]  Well, we can do it in a couple of months.
[1:47:59.960 --> 1:48:02.120]  We've done it in 45 days.
[1:48:02.120 --> 1:48:04.240]  We just need some guinea pigs to test this on.
[1:48:04.240 --> 1:48:05.240]  You want to give us some money?
[1:48:05.240 --> 1:48:06.960]  You gave them a lot of money?
[1:48:06.960 --> 1:48:14.040]  Yeah, made Monsef Slouy, the guy who was on the board, made him the vaccine czar to
[1:48:14.040 --> 1:48:16.360]  vet these different ones.
[1:48:16.360 --> 1:48:24.600]  And the thing that makes Moderna so dangerous is it's based on messing with your DNA and
[1:48:24.600 --> 1:48:26.160]  your RNA.
[1:48:26.160 --> 1:48:32.360]  And if you don't understand how dangerous that is, the story that was out just the last
[1:48:32.360 --> 1:48:35.960]  couple of days, it may still be up on Drudge Report, it was floating around, it came from
[1:48:35.960 --> 1:48:42.000]  the week, but I have the original story here from 10.medium.com.
[1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:48.720]  Just edited human embryos in the lab and it was a disaster.
[1:48:48.720 --> 1:48:56.120]  Around half of the edited human embryos contained major unintended edits, said Fyodor Yurnov,
[1:48:56.120 --> 1:48:59.560]  a gene editing expert at the University of California, Berkeley.
[1:48:59.560 --> 1:49:02.000]  He said, there is no sugarcoating this.
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:08.840]  This is a restraining order for all genome editors to stay the living daylights away from
[1:49:08.840 --> 1:49:10.960]  embryo editing.
[1:49:10.960 --> 1:49:14.960]  Let me tell you why you don't do embryo editing of humans or anything like that.
[1:49:14.960 --> 1:49:20.240]  You make a change at the embryo level and that change is going to be permanent for that
[1:49:20.240 --> 1:49:23.080]  organism.
[1:49:23.080 --> 1:49:31.800]  And because you can make changes, they've done some genetic engineering to affect animals
[1:49:31.800 --> 1:49:33.080]  and adult animals.
[1:49:33.080 --> 1:49:36.920]  You do that kind of genetic engineering and it will be temporary.
[1:49:36.920 --> 1:49:39.480]  But if you do it to an embryo, it's permanent.
[1:49:39.480 --> 1:49:44.920]  Not only that, but those changes that you've made, right or wrong, good or bad, are going
[1:49:44.920 --> 1:49:49.320]  to be propagated to their offspring forever, forever.
[1:49:49.320 --> 1:49:50.320]  Very, very dangerous.
[1:49:50.320 --> 1:49:51.320]  They don't know what they're doing.
[1:49:51.320 --> 1:49:54.960]  And let me tell you, when we go back and we look at this, this is one of the reasons
[1:49:54.960 --> 1:50:00.840]  that this gets me so upset is because Fauci and Collins are at the center of this.
[1:50:00.840 --> 1:50:04.720]  Fauci's boss, Francis Collins, was the guy who, before he went to the, became the head
[1:50:04.720 --> 1:50:06.520]  of the NIH.
[1:50:06.520 --> 1:50:09.680]  He headed the Human Genome Project.
[1:50:09.680 --> 1:50:13.160]  They had the best scientists and they worked for decades with the best computers and so
[1:50:13.160 --> 1:50:14.480]  forth.
[1:50:14.480 --> 1:50:16.880]  And they wound up saying, you know, we've got an awful lot of junk DNA.
[1:50:16.880 --> 1:50:18.880]  They still don't understand it.
[1:50:18.880 --> 1:50:22.320]  They still don't understand what they're doing.
[1:50:22.320 --> 1:50:25.960]  And then they've got a tool that is not a scalpel.
[1:50:25.960 --> 1:50:28.000]  It is a chainsaw.
[1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:31.280]  And people who have been using this, people in the cattle industry and so forth, have been
[1:50:31.280 --> 1:50:43.080]  using it to say, hey, when you make an edit with the Casper-Krisnei, the CRISPR-Cas9 editing,
[1:50:43.080 --> 1:50:48.120]  it's not software, it's a organism that they're using to do this editing.
[1:50:48.120 --> 1:50:49.960]  They said, it's not very precise.
[1:50:49.960 --> 1:50:52.080]  We go in and we think we want to make a change here.
[1:50:52.080 --> 1:50:54.720]  And they don't even know if that's the right thing to do.
[1:50:54.720 --> 1:50:58.240]  But when they go in to make that change, they make secondary and tertiary changes to the
[1:50:58.240 --> 1:51:02.000]  organism and they don't know what's happening with that.
[1:51:02.000 --> 1:51:05.000]  So I say it's like a chainsaw, not a scalpel.
[1:51:05.000 --> 1:51:08.520]  And they don't even know what they're supposed to be adding in the first place.
[1:51:08.520 --> 1:51:10.120]  It's a very, very dangerous thing.
[1:51:10.120 --> 1:51:15.320]  But the reason this is being pursued and what is so dangerous about Moderna, they originally
[1:51:15.320 --> 1:51:19.160]  called themselves Mode RNA, they changed the pronunciation of it.
[1:51:19.160 --> 1:51:26.960]  But they are really going in and editing Messenger RNA and as I've pointed out before,
[1:51:26.960 --> 1:51:29.800]  it operates very much like a virus or like a cancer.
[1:51:29.800 --> 1:51:30.800]  These things are all related.
[1:51:30.800 --> 1:51:35.480]  You go in and start editing DNA or RNA.
[1:51:35.480 --> 1:51:38.040]  I mean, we'll be right back.
[1:51:38.040 --> 1:51:42.240]  One of our best-selling products is Living Defense and it's been sold out for over four
[1:51:42.240 --> 1:51:45.560]  months because it's hard to source the ingredients that are organic.
[1:51:45.560 --> 1:51:48.240]  We've got a limited supply right now, but it's selling out fast.
[1:51:48.240 --> 1:51:51.360]  And I want those of you that have it, the experience of Living Defense to get it for
[1:51:51.360 --> 1:51:52.360]  yourself.
[1:51:52.360 --> 1:51:53.360]  Here's just part of one testimonial.
[1:51:53.360 --> 1:51:58.240]  Look, in January 2016, I went in a hospital, I went in the VA hospital out here in Boise,
[1:51:58.240 --> 1:51:59.600]  and I was in there until June.
[1:51:59.600 --> 1:52:04.240]  And one of the only things that got me through that ordeal was listening to Info Wars three
[1:52:04.240 --> 1:52:08.880]  hours a day and I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about Living Defense.
[1:52:08.880 --> 1:52:09.880]  Let me tell you something, man.
[1:52:09.880 --> 1:52:14.680]  I had an internal digestive problem and I stumbled with it for about five or six years
[1:52:14.680 --> 1:52:17.000]  and the doctors, they tried every tip.
[1:52:17.000 --> 1:52:18.200]  Nobody could figure out what it is.
[1:52:18.200 --> 1:52:21.760]  And then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said,
[1:52:21.760 --> 1:52:23.760]  you know what?
[1:52:23.760 --> 1:52:24.760]  I'm going to get me some of that freaking Living Defense.
[1:52:24.760 --> 1:52:27.400]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritional because they don't want you to have a stuff,
[1:52:27.400 --> 1:52:31.400]  but I ordered it, had it shipped to me, I got it, I hid it from the nurses, I started
[1:52:31.400 --> 1:52:32.400]  taking it, man.
[1:52:32.400 --> 1:52:34.880]  That stuff changed my life, it saved my life.
[1:52:34.880 --> 1:52:39.120]  Alex Jones and Info Wars saved my life.
[1:52:39.120 --> 1:52:43.240]  Aerodyne Technology Delivery System.
[1:52:43.240 --> 1:52:49.040]  The first of its kind, pure, nascent, atomic iodine that can be delivered through a spray
[1:52:49.040 --> 1:52:50.040]  bottle.
[1:52:50.040 --> 1:52:55.880]  This level of innovation of X2 is here, introducing Survival Shield X2 Spray.
[1:52:55.880 --> 1:52:58.960]  The great part about the X2 Spray is it's great on the go.
[1:52:58.960 --> 1:53:03.120]  When you've got it in the dropper, it's great at your house, it's great at work, but this
[1:53:03.120 --> 1:53:08.320]  is great for the car, it's great to keep with you, and again, it's also good for the throat
[1:53:08.320 --> 1:53:12.600]  and mouth to get the effects of iodine, not to just ingest it into the stomach.
[1:53:12.600 --> 1:53:16.240]  We're really excited about it, it's 33% off out of the gates.
[1:53:16.240 --> 1:53:20.680]  It was listeners' idea asking for us to come up with a spray bottle that had us talk to
[1:53:20.680 --> 1:53:24.760]  the scientists and developers and come up with a system that aerosolizes it and delivers
[1:53:24.760 --> 1:53:28.240]  it to the body in a new and in some ways, even better way.
[1:53:28.240 --> 1:53:34.440]  Get your Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine spray now at 33% off at infowarstore.com and
[1:53:34.440 --> 1:53:42.120]  experience the power of aerosolized X2 nascent iodine for yourself.
[1:53:42.120 --> 1:54:03.640]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:54:03.640 --> 1:54:09.120]  I was just talking about this failed experiment that scared the people who looked at it.
[1:54:09.120 --> 1:54:13.720]  As they looked at these embryos, they're modifying, they said, to understand the role of a single
[1:54:13.720 --> 1:54:18.880]  gene in early human development, a team of scientists at the London-based Francis Crick
[1:54:18.880 --> 1:54:24.920]  Institute, again, Francis Crick was one of the two co-discoverers of the DNA, removed
[1:54:24.920 --> 1:54:30.240]  from a set of 18 donated embryos, they said, even though the embryos were destroyed after
[1:54:30.240 --> 1:54:35.960]  just 14 days, it was enough time for a single edit to transform into, quote, major unintended
[1:54:35.960 --> 1:54:36.960]  edits.
[1:54:36.960 --> 1:54:42.960]  Now, talk about how afraid they are and how, you know, it became a big issue when China
[1:54:42.960 --> 1:54:47.720]  did it, they sanctioned and disappeared the scientists who did it.
[1:54:47.720 --> 1:54:54.880]  And yet it is at the core, not only of the beginning of this COVID-19 virus, but also
[1:54:54.880 --> 1:54:58.560]  the end game, the vaccine, the genetically engineered vaccine.
[1:54:58.560 --> 1:55:02.600]  You know, we look at the fact that Francis Collins is always saying he was there with
[1:55:02.600 --> 1:55:09.480]  the human genome experiment, he's now head of the NIH that Fauci works for, and they
[1:55:09.480 --> 1:55:16.120]  are pushing a vaccine and the lead candidate is one that's going to do genetic engineering.
[1:55:16.120 --> 1:55:24.600]  And as the, and it was Allison Young at USA Today who did a wonderful series of stories
[1:55:24.600 --> 1:55:33.520]  showing lax security and lax safety measures at biosafety level three and biosafety level
[1:55:33.520 --> 1:55:36.800]  four labs across this country.
[1:55:36.800 --> 1:55:43.760]  And it was absolutely breathtaking and frightening in the lapses that they'd had.
[1:55:43.760 --> 1:55:48.720]  Animals that had been seriously modified and infected with very dangerous pathogens escaping,
[1:55:48.720 --> 1:55:49.720]  contagious pathogens.
[1:55:49.720 --> 1:55:55.560]  You know, the whole purpose of all this, it's Nazi science folks.
[1:55:55.560 --> 1:56:00.800]  We executed people for doing this type of stuff after World War II.
[1:56:00.800 --> 1:56:02.920]  We had Nazis who were executed for this.
[1:56:02.920 --> 1:56:11.920]  We had Japanese scientists who were executed, but the best ones we brought over quietly.
[1:56:11.920 --> 1:56:19.480]  Operation paperclip, they became the basis for a biochemical and bio, biological or chemical
[1:56:19.480 --> 1:56:23.120]  warfare and a biological warfare system.
[1:56:23.120 --> 1:56:27.160]  We wanted their science, so we didn't execute those guys.
[1:56:27.160 --> 1:56:33.400]  And so they wound up at Fort Detrick and other places and the legacy of this is now the kinds
[1:56:33.400 --> 1:56:40.200]  of programs that the NIH, Francis Collins and Fauci were involved in.
[1:56:40.200 --> 1:56:44.160]  You know, we talk about the origins of this and how they were allowing this to go on at
[1:56:44.160 --> 1:56:49.460]  UNC Chapel Hill, how they were funding it in China at that very lab, $3.7 million.
[1:56:49.460 --> 1:56:56.400]  And they did that in defiance of the prohibitions of stopping, you know, they said, stop funding
[1:56:56.400 --> 1:56:57.400]  this.
[1:56:57.400 --> 1:56:58.400]  Why?
[1:56:58.400 --> 1:57:03.360]  Because of all the major lapses that they had had in terms of safety.
[1:57:03.360 --> 1:57:04.360]  But they didn't.
[1:57:04.360 --> 1:57:05.360]  They continued on with it.
[1:57:05.360 --> 1:57:11.400]  So people were outraged when Chapel Hill came out with their research and Fauci said, yeah,
[1:57:11.400 --> 1:57:14.480]  we just continued, you know, about a half dozen of these that we thought were good.
[1:57:14.480 --> 1:57:18.120]  We just, even though you told us not to, we continued to do it.
[1:57:18.120 --> 1:57:19.720]  They're absolutely out of control.
[1:57:19.720 --> 1:57:21.920]  These people are like the military industrial complex.
[1:57:21.920 --> 1:57:26.400]  They have, they don't pay any attention to what Congress or the president or anybody
[1:57:26.400 --> 1:57:28.040]  says to them.
[1:57:28.040 --> 1:57:29.720]  Their law under themselves.
[1:57:29.720 --> 1:57:31.120]  And they're Nazi scientists.
[1:57:31.120 --> 1:57:35.560]  I mean, that would not only be removed and discredited, they ought to be jailed for the
[1:57:35.560 --> 1:57:37.020]  kind of stuff that they're doing.
[1:57:37.020 --> 1:57:39.680]  And yet they get away with this.
[1:57:39.680 --> 1:57:42.960]  You know, we go back and we look at what Michael Crichton's the central thing that he was talking
[1:57:42.960 --> 1:57:43.960]  about with Jurassic Park.
[1:57:43.960 --> 1:57:50.600]  You know, we look at it as a very entertaining movie about dinosaurs running around everything.
[1:57:50.600 --> 1:57:57.920]  But if you look at the book, what he was concerned about was the ethics that nobody is concerned
[1:57:57.920 --> 1:58:04.720]  about with this stuff, the ethics that Francis Collins and Tony Fauci don't care about or
[1:58:04.720 --> 1:58:08.880]  the Chinese scientists don't care about or the people at Moderna who are developing these
[1:58:08.880 --> 1:58:15.640]  vaccines at breakneck speed don't care about.
[1:58:15.640 --> 1:58:21.200]  And what he was saying at the time and a lot of scientists were saying it decades ago.
[1:58:21.200 --> 1:58:26.880]  They said our scientific capability, our technology is outstripping our ability to make any ethical
[1:58:26.880 --> 1:58:27.880]  judgments about this.
[1:58:27.880 --> 1:58:31.440]  But you know, the problem is, is that nobody's even trying to make ethical judgments about
[1:58:31.440 --> 1:58:32.440]  this.
[1:58:32.440 --> 1:58:33.960]  It isn't that it's moving so fast we can't do it.
[1:58:33.960 --> 1:58:36.840]  So we don't even care about that anymore.
[1:58:36.840 --> 1:58:37.840]  We'll be right back.
[1:58:37.840 --> 1:58:51.880]  It's finally here, introducing the first of its kind, nascent iodine spray with true
[1:58:51.880 --> 1:58:53.120]  atomic iodine.
[1:58:53.120 --> 1:58:57.600]  Listers have been asking us for months to develop an iodine spray made with our exclusive
[1:58:57.600 --> 1:58:59.800]  deep earth crystal nascent iodine.
[1:58:59.800 --> 1:59:01.760]  After extensive development, it's finally here.
[1:59:01.760 --> 1:59:06.400]  Our proprietary new aerodyne technology allows us to harness the full power of ancient iodine
[1:59:06.400 --> 1:59:10.720]  crystals from 7,000 feet below the earth's surface into an ultimate spray formula.
[1:59:10.720 --> 1:59:14.880]  I have been using the new X2 spray every day and I feel good knowing that I have the power
[1:59:14.880 --> 1:59:17.240]  of true nascent iodine working for my body.
[1:59:17.240 --> 1:59:18.920]  I can personally feel the difference.
[1:59:18.920 --> 1:59:23.160]  We know iodine is an essential mineral that supports thyroid health as well as healthy
[1:59:23.160 --> 1:59:27.360]  metabolism, healthy hormone levels and healthy cognitive function.
[1:59:27.360 --> 1:59:31.920]  Iodine may also support your body and healthy response to environmental and dietary toxins.
[1:59:31.920 --> 1:59:36.280]  Get your daily dose of essential iodine and experience the benefits of true nascent iodine
[1:59:36.280 --> 1:59:37.280]  today.
[1:59:37.280 --> 1:59:42.440]  Get the new Survival Shield X2 spray for 33% off at InfowarsStore.com before we sell
[1:59:42.440 --> 1:59:44.400]  out of our new limited first shipment.
[1:59:44.400 --> 2:00:10.400]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show and now your
[2:00:10.400 --> 2:00:11.400]  host, David Knight.
[2:00:11.400 --> 2:00:19.860]  David, who is working to take viruses and bacteria that are dangerous, make them more
[2:00:19.860 --> 2:00:21.200]  deadly and more easily spread.
[2:00:21.200 --> 2:00:22.800]  That's what they call gain of function.
[2:00:22.800 --> 2:00:24.620]  The CDC does that.
[2:00:24.620 --> 2:00:27.000]  The NIH does that.
[2:00:27.000 --> 2:00:29.040]  In Europe, they're doing things like that.
[2:00:29.040 --> 2:00:34.680]  The EU has now proposed emergency leeway on gene engineering rules for coronavirus vaccines
[2:00:34.680 --> 2:00:35.680]  because it's coronavirus.
[2:00:35.680 --> 2:00:37.800]  Let's just get rid of all the rules.
[2:00:37.800 --> 2:00:38.920]  And here's the problem, folks.
[2:00:38.920 --> 2:00:42.320]  There are no rules for the people who are making the rules right now.
[2:00:42.320 --> 2:00:46.240]  We no longer have any restraints, any legal restraints.
[2:00:46.240 --> 2:00:49.160]  Everybody has thrown off the chains of the Constitution.
[2:00:49.160 --> 2:00:53.440]  And when they do that, they're forging chains for you.
[2:00:53.440 --> 2:00:59.920]  The people making the rules have no rules or restrictions at all.
[2:00:59.920 --> 2:01:04.280]  And so they're saying, Reuters that are reported, this is Reuters, Reuters are reported last
[2:01:04.280 --> 2:01:05.280]  week.
[2:01:05.280 --> 2:01:09.800]  The EU's Executive Commission was considering easing those rules for COVID vaccines.
[2:01:09.800 --> 2:01:16.840]  EU officials said many promising vaccines under development against the new coronavirus
[2:01:16.840 --> 2:01:19.840]  could face delays in European trials if the rules are not relaxed.
[2:01:19.840 --> 2:01:22.400]  Why were those rules there?
[2:01:22.400 --> 2:01:23.600]  They were to protect your health.
[2:01:23.600 --> 2:01:26.240]  Oh, but we don't care about protecting your health now.
[2:01:26.240 --> 2:01:29.480]  Now we've got to have a vaccine.
[2:01:29.480 --> 2:01:32.680]  In Italy and France, for example, treatments must receive authorization from government
[2:01:32.680 --> 2:01:35.840]  environment or research departments, as well as from health and drug authorities.
[2:01:35.840 --> 2:01:38.120]  But we don't have time for that.
[2:01:38.120 --> 2:01:42.240]  We didn't have time to even go through and test people and figure out what was going
[2:01:42.240 --> 2:01:44.360]  on before we locked everything down.
[2:01:44.360 --> 2:01:45.760]  We just had to do it right now.
[2:01:45.760 --> 2:01:50.280]  You know, I've heard this argument made before when Hillary Clinton was trying to take over
[2:01:50.280 --> 2:01:56.040]  health care and I was going to meetings and speaking against it.
[2:01:56.040 --> 2:02:00.320]  And I heard one person after the other that always make the argument.
[2:02:00.320 --> 2:02:03.080]  The health care system is so bad now.
[2:02:03.080 --> 2:02:04.080]  We got to do something.
[2:02:04.080 --> 2:02:08.000]  And I said, all right, well, maybe you ought to take a look at what she's proposing here.
[2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:12.280]  Because if you've got a fire and you've got a bucket of liquid over there, you might want
[2:02:12.280 --> 2:02:19.320]  to see if that's water or if it's gasoline before you throw it on the fire.
[2:02:19.320 --> 2:02:20.680]  And that's exactly what they're doing.
[2:02:20.680 --> 2:02:25.960]  They're getting ready to throw a bucket with these untested vaccines.
[2:02:25.960 --> 2:02:32.800]  Many of them based on very, very dangerous, unproven ideas of genetic modification.
[2:02:32.800 --> 2:02:38.480]  Again, Moderna has never produced a single treatment that's been approved for anybody
[2:02:38.480 --> 2:02:39.480]  when they were tested.
[2:02:39.480 --> 2:02:43.000]  So now they've got a half a billion dollars to run through something at operational warp
[2:02:43.000 --> 2:02:44.000]  speed.
[2:02:44.000 --> 2:02:46.680]  And where are you going to manufacture these things?
[2:02:46.680 --> 2:02:49.560]  You know, 300 million doses, one for everybody.
[2:02:49.560 --> 2:02:53.560]  Military, you get yours first.
[2:02:53.560 --> 2:02:55.560]  Can't wait to test it.
[2:02:55.560 --> 2:02:57.360]  They can't wait to give it to you.
[2:02:57.360 --> 2:02:59.000]  That's the whole point.
[2:02:59.000 --> 2:03:04.440]  They're just itching to stick that thing in your arm, these government pricks.
[2:03:04.440 --> 2:03:06.920]  And you better tell them what they can do.
[2:03:06.920 --> 2:03:09.840]  Makes me so angry to see this stuff.
[2:03:09.840 --> 2:03:13.680]  I've been talking about this for years.
[2:03:13.680 --> 2:03:15.520]  What's going on with all of this?
[2:03:15.520 --> 2:03:18.680]  And I said, when this happened, I said, well, you know, there's indications that this thing
[2:03:18.680 --> 2:03:20.840]  was modified and there are.
[2:03:20.840 --> 2:03:25.440]  Fortunately, it's not as dangerous as it could have been.
[2:03:25.440 --> 2:03:27.680]  But it's just a matter of time before they get it right.
[2:03:27.680 --> 2:03:31.600]  It's just a matter of time before they make a mistake and let something out or before
[2:03:31.600 --> 2:03:33.280]  they deliberately do this as a weapon.
[2:03:33.280 --> 2:03:34.720]  We've got to shut these.
[2:03:34.720 --> 2:03:40.440]  What we ought to be working on is not a vaccine, an untested vaccine to give to everybody.
[2:03:40.440 --> 2:03:47.040]  We need to be shutting down these Nazi scientists for running this biochemical and biological
[2:03:47.040 --> 2:03:49.760]  warfare against us.
[2:03:49.760 --> 2:03:52.720]  We need to be shutting that down.
[2:03:52.720 --> 2:03:55.760]  They try to do it for a short period of time and then they reauthorize it again.
[2:03:55.760 --> 2:03:58.240]  So these people are out there able to do this.
[2:03:58.240 --> 2:04:01.320]  As I was saying, Michael Crichton, when Jurassic Park is in, you've got to think about the
[2:04:01.320 --> 2:04:05.080]  ethics of what you're doing and what happens if this gets out of control.
[2:04:05.080 --> 2:04:09.720]  And a lot of scientists have been ringing that bell.
[2:04:09.720 --> 2:04:18.320]  The real problem with the genetic engineering, which goes beyond these characters who have
[2:04:18.320 --> 2:04:20.600]  their own depopulation agenda.
[2:04:20.600 --> 2:04:26.160]  There's another side of this that's equally disturbing out of another novel that always
[2:04:26.160 --> 2:04:32.760]  is etched into my mind and that is a change agent by Daniel Suarez.
[2:04:32.760 --> 2:04:36.320]  The beginning of it is excellent.
[2:04:36.320 --> 2:04:45.600]  It begins with a couple who are, they've gone to an underground facility that is doing genetic
[2:04:45.600 --> 2:04:49.320]  modification for humans.
[2:04:49.320 --> 2:04:53.880]  And the premise of his novel is that this is in the future where they really do know
[2:04:53.880 --> 2:04:58.840]  what they're modifying and they really can do this stuff.
[2:04:58.840 --> 2:05:06.920]  And so you have a couple there and the way he sets this up, one of them, let's say the
[2:05:06.920 --> 2:05:11.600]  husband, is all for doing the genetic modification.
[2:05:11.600 --> 2:05:16.520]  He's brought the wife along and she's not really sure about this.
[2:05:16.520 --> 2:05:19.440]  And then you've got the salesman.
[2:05:19.440 --> 2:05:23.920]  And what the salesman is telling them is he says, look, if you make these changes and
[2:05:23.920 --> 2:05:26.960]  they've got different packages, you know, well, I've got this change and it's going
[2:05:26.960 --> 2:05:29.400]  to cost you this much and that'll make the kids smarter.
[2:05:29.400 --> 2:05:31.360]  Here's another one that'll give them longer life.
[2:05:31.360 --> 2:05:34.880]  Here's another one that will give them better strength and so forth.
[2:05:34.880 --> 2:05:40.880]  They've got all these different things that they can do to improve your child, eugenics.
[2:05:40.880 --> 2:05:43.720]  And she's like, well, I don't know, things could go wrong with that.
[2:05:43.720 --> 2:05:45.040]  And he goes, let me tell you something.
[2:05:45.040 --> 2:05:46.040]  We know what we're doing.
[2:05:46.040 --> 2:05:51.920]  We're experts at this and not only that, but when you make, when you pay this money,
[2:05:51.920 --> 2:05:52.920]  this is a lot of money.
[2:05:52.920 --> 2:05:55.760]  I know for each one of these changes, but every one of these changes that you make to
[2:05:55.760 --> 2:06:01.280]  your child, that's going to be passed along to your grandchildren and your great grandchildren.
[2:06:01.280 --> 2:06:05.720]  And so you're creating a legacy here with this money that you give me.
[2:06:05.720 --> 2:06:11.400]  We're going to create a legacy of improvements for every generation of your descendants are
[2:06:11.400 --> 2:06:14.480]  now going to be advantaged compared to everybody else.
[2:06:14.480 --> 2:06:17.240]  He's still not ready to buy into this.
[2:06:17.240 --> 2:06:23.000]  And so then he pulls out the fear factor and he said, well, let me tell you, here's
[2:06:23.000 --> 2:06:24.000]  the situation.
[2:06:24.000 --> 2:06:25.560]  Other people are doing this as well.
[2:06:25.560 --> 2:06:28.760]  Remember, this is a black market that we're talking about here, right?
[2:06:28.760 --> 2:06:32.320]  This is not a, you know, government is trying to shut this down, but this is a black market
[2:06:32.320 --> 2:06:33.320]  that's operating.
[2:06:33.320 --> 2:06:34.320]  You know, those things do happen.
[2:06:34.320 --> 2:06:35.320]  That's why we have the drug war.
[2:06:35.320 --> 2:06:38.320]  And it's been going on for 50 years because you prohibit something that doesn't make
[2:06:38.320 --> 2:06:39.320]  it go away.
[2:06:39.320 --> 2:06:43.480]  If the technology is there, it's there.
[2:06:43.480 --> 2:06:46.600]  And so he says, uh, so here's, here, okay, you don't want to do this.
[2:06:46.600 --> 2:06:49.480]  Well, let me give you the other side of this, the fear side.
[2:06:49.480 --> 2:06:50.480]  He sells her.
[2:06:50.480 --> 2:06:54.080]  He says, uh, other people are doing this.
[2:06:54.080 --> 2:06:57.200]  A lot of other people are doing this.
[2:06:57.200 --> 2:07:04.440]  And if you don't do this for your child, your child is going to be dumber, weaker, fill
[2:07:04.440 --> 2:07:08.880]  in the blank than the other children.
[2:07:08.880 --> 2:07:15.960]  Your child will be the servant of those children, those, that next generation and not only that,
[2:07:15.960 --> 2:07:21.480]  but all of your descendants by not doing this, if you don't do this, see, this is the argument
[2:07:21.480 --> 2:07:26.880]  that gets the governments into the arms races and so forth.
[2:07:26.880 --> 2:07:31.520]  So basically it takes that same argument that is always used for the arms race, you know,
[2:07:31.520 --> 2:07:40.440]  to push, um, autonomous killing robots or nuclear weapon increases or the bio warfare
[2:07:40.440 --> 2:07:42.120]  program itself.
[2:07:42.120 --> 2:07:48.560]  If you don't do it, the other people will and you will wind up losing to them.
[2:07:48.560 --> 2:07:53.280]  It's a brilliant, just if you don't read anything other than the introduction of that book,
[2:07:53.280 --> 2:07:58.320]  it lays out the moral dilemma, which really is something that permeates everything that
[2:07:58.320 --> 2:08:04.560]  the government does, it's all based on keeping up and keeping ahead of other people.
[2:08:04.560 --> 2:08:12.400]  And it is a very, when I look at what is happening with us and what got me started on this was
[2:08:12.400 --> 2:08:19.400]  a few years ago, you know, they brought in a bacteria that came out, it was only in two
[2:08:19.400 --> 2:08:25.360]  different places in the world and, and it had about a 45% fatality rate if you got infected
[2:08:25.360 --> 2:08:28.640]  with this bacteria, but that wasn't good enough for them.
[2:08:28.640 --> 2:08:31.320]  They decided that they would bring it in and weaponize it.
[2:08:31.320 --> 2:08:36.440]  And so, you know, we were talking about the Tuskegee experiment, Tulane and so forth being
[2:08:36.440 --> 2:08:37.440]  involved in that.
[2:08:37.440 --> 2:08:42.240]  Well, they took it to Tulane University, you get that kind of stuff done.
[2:08:42.240 --> 2:08:46.360]  And they took it to a biosafety level three lab.
[2:08:46.360 --> 2:08:51.720]  It was also adjacent to the national primate center, had a lot of primates there and they
[2:08:51.720 --> 2:08:59.440]  were in an open area and lo and behold, this bacteria, Burkholderia pseudomalei was the
[2:08:59.440 --> 2:09:04.400]  name of it, it got out of the biosafety level three lab and it was found in some of these
[2:09:04.400 --> 2:09:07.280]  monkeys that were roaming around in the field.
[2:09:07.280 --> 2:09:11.640]  And what's even more troubling about it was that this Burkholderia pseudomalei gets into
[2:09:11.640 --> 2:09:17.640]  the soil and replicates and spreads and so the CDC brought in investigators, one of them
[2:09:17.640 --> 2:09:23.240]  got sick with that, said, oh, don't worry, that doesn't have anything to do with this.
[2:09:23.240 --> 2:09:26.400]  She investigates this stuff all the time, it must have been a prior infection.
[2:09:26.400 --> 2:09:29.680]  Oh, oh, so you had somebody who was sick with this and you brought them in to investigate
[2:09:29.680 --> 2:09:30.680]  it?
[2:09:30.680 --> 2:09:31.680]  Yeah, okay.
[2:09:31.680 --> 2:09:35.880]  But when you look at this and you understand that they're bringing this thing in that kills
[2:09:35.880 --> 2:09:41.520]  45% of the people, I mean, it's not Ebola, but it's certainly much more deadly than COVID-19.
[2:09:41.520 --> 2:09:46.160]  They bring that in, they weaponize it to make it more easily spread to make the globalist
[2:09:46.160 --> 2:09:50.800]  want us domesticated, they want us inside our homes, watching our televisions and being
[2:09:50.800 --> 2:09:53.960]  controlled by our quote, smartphones.
[2:09:53.960 --> 2:09:54.960]  Everybody knows this.
[2:09:54.960 --> 2:09:55.960]  It's to admit a goal.
[2:09:55.960 --> 2:10:00.320]  We've had whistleblowers from Facebook, Twitter and Google go public and say at the highest
[2:10:00.320 --> 2:10:05.800]  levels, their job is to make you neurotic, destroy your mind and take over your life.
[2:10:05.800 --> 2:10:08.280]  And now the COVID hysteria is all about that.
[2:10:08.280 --> 2:10:12.520]  I recently had a woman in the street while I was with my youngest daughter and my daughter
[2:10:12.520 --> 2:10:19.200]  walked close to her and she said, get away six feet and gave her a super ugly look.
[2:10:19.200 --> 2:10:21.640]  This ladies and gentlemen is mental illness.
[2:10:21.640 --> 2:10:25.040]  My daughter walking four feet from some old woman is not a crime.
[2:10:25.040 --> 2:10:27.840]  The old woman's mental illness is the crime.
[2:10:27.840 --> 2:10:32.960]  If we give in to it, this is total and complete mind control.
[2:10:32.960 --> 2:10:38.240]  We must expose the COVID hoax now they're going to continue to clamp down using this.
[2:10:38.240 --> 2:10:39.240]  It's a U.N.
[2:10:39.240 --> 2:10:40.240]  Bill Gates plan.
[2:10:40.240 --> 2:10:43.600]  They've been proven to be criminal liars and they must be defeated.
[2:10:43.600 --> 2:10:46.600]  They must be exposed.

[2:11:48.320 --> 2:12:14.080]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:12:14.080 --> 2:12:15.080]  Welcome back.
[2:12:15.080 --> 2:12:18.960]  This is Alex Jones with Arms Races and as we look at the arms race, we see that China
[2:12:18.960 --> 2:12:26.760]  is now showing proudly showing their miniature robo tank with a lot of firepower.
[2:12:26.760 --> 2:12:28.360]  Make no doubt about it.
[2:12:28.360 --> 2:12:33.160]  Where we are headed is autonomous killing machines.
[2:12:33.160 --> 2:12:34.920]  You should be very concerned about that.
[2:12:34.920 --> 2:12:39.160]  You should be very concerned about and I've mentioned this.
[2:12:39.160 --> 2:12:43.080]  I've done videos about this saying that you'd be concerned about where they're going with
[2:12:43.080 --> 2:12:44.080]  the police.
[2:12:44.080 --> 2:12:49.800]  We have as we see this COVID-19 brought out and people are getting so afraid of being
[2:12:49.800 --> 2:12:52.160]  around other people.
[2:12:52.160 --> 2:12:53.160]  They're saying story after story.
[2:12:53.160 --> 2:12:54.160]  Don't worry.
[2:12:54.160 --> 2:12:56.560]  We have robot waiters and they're going to bring the food to your table.
[2:12:56.560 --> 2:13:00.000]  So you don't have to have any close contact with any other nasty humans.
[2:13:00.000 --> 2:13:03.400]  Well, you know, the food's still being made in the back by those nasty humans.
[2:13:03.400 --> 2:13:04.400]  But don't worry.
[2:13:04.400 --> 2:13:05.400]  They're working on that too.
[2:13:05.400 --> 2:13:09.620]  They're going to have some robo chefs and pretty soon, you know, they're going to purge
[2:13:09.620 --> 2:13:11.960]  out all of these diseased humans.
[2:13:11.960 --> 2:13:14.440]  You understand that the globalists are pushing all this stuff.
[2:13:14.440 --> 2:13:22.120]  They see all of us as a disease factories and they want to eliminate all of us.
[2:13:22.120 --> 2:13:25.640]  That's what's really ultimately behind this.
[2:13:25.640 --> 2:13:32.160]  And so the next step with this, as they tell everybody, you know, those humans out there,
[2:13:32.160 --> 2:13:35.960]  you don't want them as cops either because they just can't control themselves.
[2:13:35.960 --> 2:13:40.000]  So what you need to have is you need to have some robo cops, robotic police.
[2:13:40.000 --> 2:13:42.720]  So we can program.
[2:13:42.720 --> 2:13:46.400]  Well, let's assume that they do a better job of it than they did with the Imperial College
[2:13:46.400 --> 2:13:50.320]  of London's simulation that it completely locked down the globe.
[2:13:50.320 --> 2:13:51.560]  Oh, I'm so sorry.
[2:13:51.560 --> 2:13:52.560]  That was a mistake.
[2:13:52.560 --> 2:13:57.800]  Well, what do you think is going to happen when they have robo cops?
[2:13:57.800 --> 2:13:59.360]  It's not just going to be a lockdown to the globe.
[2:13:59.360 --> 2:14:00.720]  They will keep everybody locked down.
[2:14:00.720 --> 2:14:02.960]  I mean, you've seen this in sci-fi, you know, where this is headed.
[2:14:02.960 --> 2:14:04.680]  But let me tell you, this is actually where it's headed.
[2:14:04.680 --> 2:14:10.160]  I've talked to Professor Noel Sharkey several times about the efforts that made people to
[2:14:10.160 --> 2:14:13.800]  try to get them to admit that they don't want to do this, but that isn't going to work.
[2:14:13.800 --> 2:14:19.520]  It's going to be an arms race, just like we were talking about the idea being sold one
[2:14:19.520 --> 2:14:26.360]  on one with a husband and wife team about, oh, you've got to pay them money to upgrade
[2:14:26.360 --> 2:14:29.600]  your baby because if you don't, everybody else is going to upgrade their babies and
[2:14:29.600 --> 2:14:30.600]  you'll be the servant of them.
[2:14:30.600 --> 2:14:31.600]  That was the same argument.
[2:14:31.600 --> 2:14:35.480]  This has been used to push the military industrial complex, and there's one of these hideous
[2:14:35.480 --> 2:14:36.480]  things right there.
[2:14:36.480 --> 2:14:38.880]  You can now get that for a little under $75,000.
[2:14:38.880 --> 2:14:43.120]  So we should be able to replace the cops with one of these things, right, that you see right
[2:14:43.120 --> 2:14:44.120]  there on the screen.
[2:14:44.120 --> 2:14:48.120]  One of these Boston Dynamics, you know, I don't, as a matter of fact, I don't know
[2:14:48.120 --> 2:14:52.640]  too many cops that can do that kind of gymnastics.
[2:14:52.640 --> 2:14:59.440]  I can't do that kind of gymnastics, you know, but that is a very worrisome thing because
[2:14:59.440 --> 2:15:01.440]  we know where this is headed.
[2:15:01.440 --> 2:15:05.480]  And as the Chinese are doing this, make no doubt about it, they're going to have killer
[2:15:05.480 --> 2:15:08.800]  drones that are going to be making kill decisions.
[2:15:08.800 --> 2:15:13.480]  I mean, it's bad enough that we got drone assassination programs, but it's also when
[2:15:13.480 --> 2:15:17.280]  they make the kill decisions themselves because that's where it's headed.
[2:15:17.280 --> 2:15:23.480]  You know that's where it's headed because if you don't offload that decision to them,
[2:15:23.480 --> 2:15:27.280]  then your robot force will be killed by the robots that are on the scene because they'll
[2:15:27.280 --> 2:15:30.720]  make the decision real quickly on the scene.
[2:15:30.720 --> 2:15:35.760]  And so that's where this all leads, it's a logical extension to it.
[2:15:35.760 --> 2:15:39.960]  And so as we look at this and how dangerous this is going, I understand that you're not
[2:15:39.960 --> 2:15:41.880]  going to get rid of the human factor.
[2:15:41.880 --> 2:15:45.640]  You'll just have fewer humans because I have some people and say, well, I think that'd
[2:15:45.640 --> 2:15:49.280]  be a good idea because I think, you know, the robots aren't going to have the prejudices
[2:15:49.280 --> 2:15:53.160]  that the humans do or they're not going to get angry.
[2:15:53.160 --> 2:15:57.160]  Oh, no, they'll kill you in cold blood.
[2:15:57.160 --> 2:15:58.320]  That's right.
[2:15:58.320 --> 2:16:02.320]  There's going to be somebody that is going to be ultimately making those decisions in
[2:16:02.320 --> 2:16:09.720]  the background and it will give them plausible deniability to wipe out entire areas on the
[2:16:09.720 --> 2:16:14.000]  planet or most of the areas on the planet.
[2:16:14.000 --> 2:16:17.040]  And they'll just say, oh, well, there's a software error and it went viral.
[2:16:17.040 --> 2:16:21.160]  You know, we really can't control that.
[2:16:21.160 --> 2:16:23.480]  We look at what is happening with India and China.
[2:16:23.480 --> 2:16:26.200]  This is kind of a, I station zebra thing.
[2:16:26.200 --> 2:16:35.240]  Remember that movie, one of my favorite movies, Patrick Gouin was in that, it was a standoff
[2:16:35.240 --> 2:16:40.400]  in Antarctica or the North Pole or somewhere, you know, one of those two and turned into
[2:16:40.400 --> 2:16:44.000]  a shooting war between Russia and America, but don't tell anybody about it.
[2:16:44.000 --> 2:16:47.560]  I usually don't hear anything about this, but this particular one, people are talking
[2:16:47.560 --> 2:16:48.560]  about it.
[2:16:48.560 --> 2:16:55.480]  Biggest clash between China and India and over 50 years leaves at least 50 casualties.
[2:16:55.480 --> 2:16:59.400]  If you can believe the stories that they have here, probably a lot more people in that.
[2:16:59.400 --> 2:17:04.200]  New Delhi and Beijing are both claiming the other side's forces triggered the confrontation.
[2:17:04.200 --> 2:17:12.240]  They beat each other with rocks, clubs and their fists for over eight hours in the dark.
[2:17:12.240 --> 2:17:17.040]  Some of them using the deep, the difficult and steep Himalayan terrain around them.
[2:17:17.040 --> 2:17:22.640]  Many of the casualties were caused by hand to hand combat or falls from the high cliffs.
[2:17:22.640 --> 2:17:26.800]  Many people had a fall and they drowned or they fell and they couldn't get up and they
[2:17:26.800 --> 2:17:29.520]  died of hypothermia, cold.
[2:17:29.520 --> 2:17:32.640]  Indian government officials have confirmed that at least 20 of their troops are killed.
[2:17:32.640 --> 2:17:37.880]  Several others are in critical condition suggesting that the death toll may rise, writes Breitbart.
[2:17:37.880 --> 2:17:43.720]  Indian reports claim PLA soldiers, quote, hunted down their Indian counterparts to kill them
[2:17:43.720 --> 2:17:46.560]  even as they retreated into undisputed territory.
[2:17:46.560 --> 2:17:48.960]  So what's going on here?
[2:17:48.960 --> 2:17:53.800]  What occurred at the border, they have an area, kind of like the demilitarized zones
[2:17:53.800 --> 2:17:59.200]  that you have when you have a border conflict, is called the line of actual control, the
[2:17:59.200 --> 2:18:00.200]  LAC.
[2:18:00.200 --> 2:18:05.160]  It's a strip of border between India and Chinese occupied Tibet.
[2:18:05.160 --> 2:18:08.440]  Last week, diplomats from both sides issued a statement claiming that they had reached
[2:18:08.440 --> 2:18:13.240]  a peaceful resolution on the LAC tensions and then this breaks out.
[2:18:13.240 --> 2:18:19.360]  News of India says that China suffered between 35 and 50 casualties, which includes both
[2:18:19.360 --> 2:18:20.720]  killed and wounded.
[2:18:20.720 --> 2:18:26.120]  India's News 18 reported that at least 23 Indian soldiers were killed in the battle,
[2:18:26.120 --> 2:18:29.880]  but as many as 110 have needed medical attention in the aftermath of the incident.
[2:18:29.880 --> 2:18:36.960]  At least two dozen Indian soldiers, the report continued, are facing life-threatening injuries.
[2:18:36.960 --> 2:18:41.200]  And then there's a comment from the Chinese government's propaganda newspaper Global Times,
[2:18:41.200 --> 2:18:47.280]  the editor-in-chief is named Hu, and who gets to comment first, who's on first?
[2:18:47.280 --> 2:18:49.160]  She's on second.
[2:18:49.160 --> 2:18:55.720]  Hu regularly uses Twitter, despite the fact the Communist Party bans Chinese citizens
[2:18:55.720 --> 2:18:56.720]  from the platform.
[2:18:56.720 --> 2:19:00.400]  But of course, you know, they have a different set of rules, just like our Fauci and Berks
[2:19:00.400 --> 2:19:01.400]  do.
[2:19:01.400 --> 2:19:10.640]  Hu claimed, they have it, that many of the Indian soldiers who died did so as a result
[2:19:10.640 --> 2:19:15.240]  of not being evacuated quickly enough from the frigid region, so we didn't kill them.
[2:19:15.240 --> 2:19:21.160]  And yet, when you look at the reports, some of them say that, you know, but neither, this
[2:19:21.160 --> 2:19:26.360]  is a surprising thing, neither side had guns, and they didn't even have these mechanized
[2:19:26.360 --> 2:19:28.960]  robots that China's got, right?
[2:19:28.960 --> 2:19:33.040]  But they were hunting them down with, they're fighting with stones, iron rods, and they
[2:19:33.040 --> 2:19:37.960]  said that the Chinese troops hunted down these Indian soldiers, didn't die of cold, they said
[2:19:37.960 --> 2:19:43.080]  they hunted them down and beat them with batons wrapped in barbed wire.
[2:19:43.080 --> 2:19:49.360]  You know, this kind of reminds me of what Einstein said, he said, I don't know what
[2:19:49.360 --> 2:19:55.640]  weapons will be used to fight World War III, but World War IV will be fought with sticks
[2:19:55.640 --> 2:19:56.640]  and stones.
[2:19:56.640 --> 2:19:59.680]  So maybe we've just seen a preview of World War IV here.
[2:19:59.680 --> 2:20:04.000]  Human nature doesn't change, however, does it, not unless you experience Christ.
[2:20:04.000 --> 2:20:10.440]  But these people have given us a preview, even though they're working on autonomous killer
[2:20:10.440 --> 2:20:15.120]  robots, and these are the people who are going to be writing the software for the autonomous
[2:20:15.120 --> 2:20:16.120]  killer robots.
[2:20:16.120 --> 2:20:22.360]  All right, I'm going to take a break, we'll be right back, and we'll talk about the hatred
[2:20:22.360 --> 2:20:25.080]  and that is being exploited here in the United States.
[2:20:25.080 --> 2:20:29.000]  These people hate each other so much that they hunt each other down with sticks and
[2:20:29.000 --> 2:20:34.360]  stones and rods wrapped in barbed wire to kill each other.
[2:20:34.360 --> 2:20:36.880]  Is that the future that is coming here to America?
[2:20:36.880 --> 2:20:39.240]  If the Democrats get their way, it is.
[2:20:39.240 --> 2:20:43.240]  If the globalists get their way, it is, because this is the agenda that they have of hate.
[2:20:43.240 --> 2:20:47.240]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut, you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[2:20:47.240 --> 2:20:48.240]  Hello, can you hear me?
[2:20:48.240 --> 2:20:49.240]  I sure can, sir, thank you.
[2:20:49.240 --> 2:20:54.760]  Hey, Alex, before I start, man, I just wanted to talk to you, bro, and it's a pleasure to
[2:20:54.760 --> 2:20:55.760]  be talking right now.
[2:20:55.760 --> 2:20:57.760]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[2:20:57.760 --> 2:21:02.800]  I'm from New Brink, Connecticut, and I just want to plug in, I'm a truck driver, and two
[2:21:02.800 --> 2:21:08.400]  before us have changed the way I drive, me and my brothers that drive, there's a couple
[2:21:08.400 --> 2:21:16.000]  of us, we're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans, we used to be on Monster and Red Bull
[2:21:16.000 --> 2:21:20.240]  and Rola, and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar, and I just
[2:21:20.240 --> 2:21:21.440]  want to thank you for that, man.
[2:21:21.440 --> 2:21:26.040]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term, high-quality energy powder
[2:21:26.040 --> 2:21:27.040]  there is.
[2:21:27.040 --> 2:21:30.080]  So, this was designed on one of the top guys in the country, he didn't want his name on
[2:21:30.080 --> 2:21:32.880]  it because, obviously, the political issues, but we had to pay a lot of money for this
[2:21:32.880 --> 2:21:36.680]  formulation just for the design of it, and we believe it is the best, strongest, but
[2:21:36.680 --> 2:21:40.600]  healthiest energy out there, and you're saying that it's made your life better, so that means
[2:21:40.600 --> 2:21:41.600]  a lot to me, thank you.
[2:21:41.600 --> 2:21:43.520]  To all your truck drivers, we love you.
[2:21:43.520 --> 2:21:48.000]  I was talking to my Patriots supplier, great suppliers, you can now say four weeks on average
[2:21:48.000 --> 2:21:51.520]  for storeable food, it's the highest quality, they've got it.
[2:21:51.520 --> 2:21:55.640]  Use this little rest we have caught in the current to come up to the service, get some
[2:21:55.640 --> 2:21:57.760]  care, before you get sucked back down.
[2:21:57.760 --> 2:22:00.280]  I personally am ordering more storeable food.
[2:22:00.280 --> 2:22:06.680]  I have to now start going into defense posture, 80% offence, but I've always been 100% offence
[2:22:06.680 --> 2:22:10.760]  trying to fully stop the globalists, and we've given them a good run, and I think down the
[2:22:10.760 --> 2:22:16.000]  road they'll be defeated, but we're going to still go down the hard road now.
[2:22:16.000 --> 2:22:20.160]  There were a lot worse roads we'd probably go down, but we've mitigated some of this,
[2:22:20.160 --> 2:22:21.880]  but it's still going to be bad in my view.
[2:22:21.880 --> 2:22:24.560]  You need to get high-quality storeable food, it's something you need.
[2:22:24.560 --> 2:22:28.520]  We have high-quality ready to get out to you, and it supports the broadcast of 360 wins,
[2:22:28.520 --> 2:22:33.280]  so please take care of your storeable foods needs at infowarstore.com and get your orders
[2:22:33.280 --> 2:22:38.440]  in now, so you get it, so you have it, some great containers, high-quality, last 25 years,
[2:22:38.440 --> 2:22:41.800]  get it while you can, because if you think things are about to let up, you ain't seen
[2:22:41.800 --> 2:22:44.240]  nothing yet.
[2:22:44.240 --> 2:22:48.520]  We're already to the latter part of June, and of course most of the country is not completely
[2:22:48.520 --> 2:22:54.480]  reopened again, and already foushee, and the UN billable indicates criminal combiner
[2:22:54.480 --> 2:23:00.040]  telling us, don't go to Trump rallies, oh no, but the very same media that promotes that
[2:23:00.040 --> 2:23:04.360]  we shouldn't go to Trump rallies is telling us we should go to the Democrat Party, Black
[2:23:04.360 --> 2:23:09.640]  Lodge Matter, all white people are evil, mind control, brainwashing events.
[2:23:09.640 --> 2:23:13.560]  This is the attempted murder of common sense and logic.
[2:23:13.560 --> 2:23:18.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to be more politically active than you ever have,
[2:23:18.120 --> 2:23:23.320]  because we are going into hardcore United Nations-controlled bondage.
[2:23:23.320 --> 2:23:27.000]  Major police departments like Los Angeles and Albuquerque, New Mexico are announcing
[2:23:27.000 --> 2:23:31.840]  they're going under UN control and turning their, quote, police into community activist
[2:23:31.840 --> 2:23:33.080]  organizers.
[2:23:33.080 --> 2:23:37.600]  This is just the beginning, everything's going to accelerate now from this point out,
[2:23:37.600 --> 2:24:06.880]  so it's here, no more games, the new world order has arrived.
[2:24:06.880 --> 2:24:13.880]  And now, your host, David Knight.
[2:24:13.880 --> 2:24:21.400]  Hi folks, we were just talking about what happened with the Chinese and Indians at the
[2:24:21.400 --> 2:24:29.560]  border, and now inside China, in Beijing, they are now pushing the second wave.
[2:24:29.560 --> 2:24:33.840]  It's beginning in China, and if you go back and look at this, I believe, and I said from
[2:24:33.840 --> 2:24:40.800]  the very beginning, I said first of all, there's evidence that this is engineered, hopefully
[2:24:40.800 --> 2:24:46.120]  they didn't do a good job of it, and it turns out they didn't, but I said I'm concerned
[2:24:46.120 --> 2:24:50.080]  that no matter what this is, no matter how dangerous it's going to be, I said that at
[2:24:50.080 --> 2:24:54.080]  the very beginning, I said the worst thing we could do would be to shut down and lock
[2:24:54.080 --> 2:24:58.720]  down our society as China has done, and then I said it again when it was done in Italy,
[2:24:58.720 --> 2:25:04.360]  and before it was done here, we already had hard data out of Italy, showing that the average
[2:25:04.360 --> 2:25:10.000]  age of the people, the first time they did it, was 80.3 years, and it was 79.5 in the
[2:25:10.000 --> 2:25:17.000]  second report, and they showed that most of the people who died had three co-morbidities,
[2:25:17.000 --> 2:25:23.600]  meaning that they didn't die from it necessarily, they died with it, and they said, and now,
[2:25:23.600 --> 2:25:28.360]  when you go back and look at this, you see 40% of the people who died were nursing homes,
[2:25:28.360 --> 2:25:32.920]  well penalty for Cuomo, because he was pushing people in the nursing homes, even as he was,
[2:25:32.920 --> 2:25:41.560]  he named a bill after his 90-some-odd-year-old mother, and I forget what her name was, let's
[2:25:41.560 --> 2:25:48.320]  just call her Clementine, that's a good name, Clementine Cuomo, goes pretty good with Frato,
[2:25:48.320 --> 2:25:54.920]  because that was my grandmother's name, let's just call her Clementine, you think I'm making
[2:25:54.920 --> 2:26:01.680]  fun of them, that was my grandmother's name, Clementine, anyway.
[2:26:01.680 --> 2:26:07.640]  He named it after her, and he put ahead a pretty stiff jail sentence, plus a $5,000 fine,
[2:26:07.640 --> 2:26:13.920]  if you infected, if you didn't practice all these lockdown and quarantine stuff and you
[2:26:13.920 --> 2:26:20.840]  got somebody infected, that was elderly, and yet he forced these people by the thousands
[2:26:20.840 --> 2:26:23.800]  in these nursing homes, because they said, look, you're not going to be able to refuse
[2:26:23.800 --> 2:26:27.680]  admission to anybody if they test positive for coronavirus in a nursing home, you've
[2:26:27.680 --> 2:26:33.400]  got to take them in, and so they've had a lot of people die in the nursing homes, but
[2:26:33.400 --> 2:26:39.760]  let's talk about that, even if this was something like Ebola, the worst thing you could do would
[2:26:39.760 --> 2:26:43.480]  be to force everybody to shut everything down, why?
[2:26:43.480 --> 2:26:47.040]  Because it was obvious from the very beginning, it was going to create food shortages, it's
[2:26:47.040 --> 2:26:52.480]  going to create all kinds of issues, created medicine shortages, done all kinds of damage
[2:26:52.480 --> 2:26:56.400]  to the health system itself.
[2:26:56.400 --> 2:27:00.080]  If you're going to fight a war, oh, this is a more, well, you don't shut down your factories
[2:27:00.080 --> 2:27:01.080]  to fight a war, right?
[2:27:01.080 --> 2:27:04.960]  It's idiotic to do that, and yet that was the model that came out of China.
[2:27:04.960 --> 2:27:11.240]  I said, we're, this may be biologically engineered, but we're being socially engineered.
[2:27:11.240 --> 2:27:12.240]  They're modeling this.
[2:27:12.240 --> 2:27:15.880]  It's like predictive programming in a movie, except it was a predictive modeling.
[2:27:15.880 --> 2:27:20.120]  They were showing the behavior, they said, look, do this, and then all the globalist
[2:27:20.120 --> 2:27:24.080]  leaders around the world were saying, yeah, we got to follow the Chinese example.
[2:27:24.080 --> 2:27:27.720]  And you had, as this was rolling out, you had all the mainstream media here in America
[2:27:27.720 --> 2:27:31.240]  saying, yeah, it's pretty creepy what they were doing with the biometric surveillance
[2:27:31.240 --> 2:27:36.800]  and the social credit system and the tracking of everybody, and yet we need to do that here
[2:27:36.800 --> 2:27:37.800]  for COVID-19.
[2:27:37.800 --> 2:27:41.800]  You know, it was creepy when they did it just because, you know, it was about politics,
[2:27:41.800 --> 2:27:44.760]  but hey, if it's about a disease, that's a good thing, and we need to do that.
[2:27:44.760 --> 2:27:46.200]  We need to step up.
[2:27:46.200 --> 2:27:51.160]  They're going to be way ahead, they're going to be so much better equipped to handle this
[2:27:51.160 --> 2:27:56.400]  than we are because we don't have tracking in place here, so we need to do that as quickly
[2:27:56.400 --> 2:27:57.400]  as possible.
[2:27:57.400 --> 2:28:02.360]  And so now we have the second wave, and the second wave is being modeled for us right
[2:28:02.360 --> 2:28:03.360]  now.
[2:28:03.360 --> 2:28:09.320]  As a matter of fact, newsbusters.org has a study that they did about how TV paused its
[2:28:09.320 --> 2:28:15.680]  pandemic panic in order to push the panic button on other things, in order to push the
[2:28:15.680 --> 2:28:17.160]  protests.
[2:28:17.160 --> 2:28:22.640]  It consumed nearly all of the airtime for three months between March to May on the Big
[2:28:22.640 --> 2:28:30.440]  Three Networks, ABC, CBS, NBC, the Mockingbird media, the propaganda press.
[2:28:30.440 --> 2:28:34.000]  The people who always did that for the CIA.
[2:28:34.000 --> 2:28:40.840]  So nearly all the time on the Big Three from early March to late May, but for two weeks,
[2:28:40.840 --> 2:28:45.320]  beginning in late May and early June, those same networks put the virus story on the backburner
[2:28:45.320 --> 2:28:51.960]  and then moved to the story about protests, and of course they had a monolithic opinion
[2:28:51.960 --> 2:28:52.960]  about that as well.
[2:28:52.960 --> 2:28:57.800]  That was always the way it was when you had just the Big Three and NPR.
[2:28:57.800 --> 2:29:01.480]  They always covered the same stories, and they always had the same take on it.
[2:29:01.480 --> 2:29:06.760]  It was almost as if somebody at the CIA was writing their narrative for them.
[2:29:06.760 --> 2:29:08.920]  You've seen this numerous times.
[2:29:08.920 --> 2:29:12.520]  We have all these different affiliates just reading the script.
[2:29:12.520 --> 2:29:14.280]  Well, they were just reading the script as well.
[2:29:14.280 --> 2:29:18.640]  Now the protest is subsided, TV news is once again ramping up its coronavirus coverage.
[2:29:18.640 --> 2:29:19.640]  So they break it down.
[2:29:19.640 --> 2:29:21.640]  Look at this table.
[2:29:21.640 --> 2:29:23.880]  Get the overhead shot here.
[2:29:23.880 --> 2:29:27.520]  It shows that in the early days, it was 20 percent.
[2:29:27.520 --> 2:29:31.400]  Then at the peak of all of this, it was 88 percent.
[2:29:31.400 --> 2:29:33.880]  And then it goes back down to 18 percent.
[2:29:33.880 --> 2:29:38.560]  It went up to almost 90 percent, now it goes back down to just under 20 percent.
[2:29:38.560 --> 2:29:42.160]  And now protests, post-protests, as that's starting to die down, they're going back to
[2:29:42.160 --> 2:29:46.040]  the other narrative and they've doubled it now from 18 percent to 36 percent.
[2:29:46.040 --> 2:29:47.440]  So it's surging again.
[2:29:47.440 --> 2:29:52.840]  This is part of the second wave of propaganda, the modeling, and it's beginning in China
[2:29:52.840 --> 2:29:55.280]  as well.
[2:29:55.280 --> 2:30:03.840]  China has had about 140 people that have now tested positive in Beijing.
[2:30:03.840 --> 2:30:07.560]  This is a city of 21 and a half million people.
[2:30:07.560 --> 2:30:09.880]  There's about eight million people in New York.
[2:30:09.880 --> 2:30:12.080]  So this is about three times the size of New York City.
[2:30:12.080 --> 2:30:19.280]  But when we went to China to adopt my daughter, we went to Nanning, I'd never heard of it.
[2:30:19.280 --> 2:30:23.720]  And it had, between six and seven million people, it was nearly as big as New York City.
[2:30:23.720 --> 2:30:28.120]  I'd never even heard of it because it's not a big city by Chinese standards.
[2:30:28.120 --> 2:30:33.560]  21 and a half million people, 158 infections.
[2:30:33.560 --> 2:30:35.320]  And what are they doing?
[2:30:35.320 --> 2:30:37.640]  They have mandated testing.
[2:30:37.640 --> 2:30:43.760]  And now you've got massive mobs at the testing facilities because you're not going to be
[2:30:43.760 --> 2:30:49.880]  able to move an inch if you're not tested and given a permission to go somewhere, which
[2:30:49.880 --> 2:30:52.480]  is already being worked on here in America.
[2:30:52.480 --> 2:31:01.440]  I showed you the wrist bracelet that was being worked on by somebody who I know that has given
[2:31:01.440 --> 2:31:02.440]  me information in the past.
[2:31:02.440 --> 2:31:05.680]  He's a white hat hacker.
[2:31:05.680 --> 2:31:11.160]  And so they're working on the computer version of this.
[2:31:11.160 --> 2:31:14.120]  But they said, you know, he said, this is the way it's going to work as we roll this
[2:31:14.120 --> 2:31:15.120]  out.
[2:31:15.120 --> 2:31:17.720]  He said, you'll have to get a test.
[2:31:17.720 --> 2:31:18.720]  There it is right there.
[2:31:18.720 --> 2:31:19.720]  There's the article.
[2:31:19.720 --> 2:31:24.360]  You'll have to get a test each day to travel.
[2:31:24.360 --> 2:31:28.400]  And then they'll give you a wristband of a particular color.
[2:31:28.400 --> 2:31:30.920]  And that'll be good for travel that day.
[2:31:30.920 --> 2:31:34.400]  And the next day, they'll change the color of the wristband until they can get it done
[2:31:34.400 --> 2:31:36.280]  with the computer stuff, right?
[2:31:36.280 --> 2:31:38.280]  That's the way they're testing it.
[2:31:38.280 --> 2:31:40.040]  And that's basically what they're doing in China.
[2:31:40.040 --> 2:31:42.640]  They're getting ready to roll this out.
[2:31:42.640 --> 2:31:49.040]  It is a fire drill, says Lisa Kingo, the executive director of the UN Global Compact.
[2:31:49.040 --> 2:31:51.600]  She did an interview with The Guardian.
[2:31:51.600 --> 2:31:56.440]  And this UN official said, there are very, very clear connections linking the current
[2:31:56.440 --> 2:31:59.440]  health crisis, the climate change issues, and Black Lives Matter.
[2:31:59.440 --> 2:32:02.880]  Now, she is not a conspiracy theorist.
[2:32:02.880 --> 2:32:06.640]  She is exposing the conspiracy plan.
[2:32:06.640 --> 2:32:08.320]  She's monologuing like a supervillain.
[2:32:08.320 --> 2:32:13.360]  She said the coronavirus pandemic is just a fire drill for what's coming.
[2:32:13.360 --> 2:32:17.240]  Government actions, purportedly taken to stop the spread of the virus, have crippled economies
[2:32:17.240 --> 2:32:21.840]  across the globe, and it's been attributed to the widespread social unrest, making her
[2:32:21.840 --> 2:32:24.640]  warning particularly sobering reports RT.
[2:32:24.640 --> 2:32:29.760]  She says, the only way forward is to create a world that leaves no one behind.
[2:32:29.760 --> 2:32:33.040]  And that phrase, where did that phrase come from?
[2:32:33.040 --> 2:32:38.960]  I thought that that was, I thought it was George W. Bush that coined that phrase, you
[2:32:38.960 --> 2:32:43.480]  know, to sell common core and the federal takeover of education.
[2:32:43.480 --> 2:32:46.960]  Oh, well, wait a minute, no, that's the UN is talking like that.
[2:32:46.960 --> 2:32:52.560]  You know, the funny thing is, is that as we look at immunity, talking about the vaccines
[2:32:52.560 --> 2:32:58.920]  that they push out, you know, big pharmaceutical companies were given immunity from legal action
[2:32:58.920 --> 2:33:02.080]  with the vaccines that they put out.
[2:33:02.080 --> 2:33:09.680]  We have given legal immunity to the police.
[2:33:09.680 --> 2:33:15.800]  And it's funny, when you do that type of thing, it almost invites bad actions, doesn't it?
[2:33:15.800 --> 2:33:21.960]  If you can't be punished when you do the wrong thing, say, I don't think that the solution
[2:33:21.960 --> 2:33:26.280]  to what is happening here in this country, yeah, we need to understand that you're always
[2:33:26.280 --> 2:33:30.800]  going to have bad actors in any organization, you have to reform them, or you become contaminated
[2:33:30.800 --> 2:33:33.280]  by you own the corruption.
[2:33:33.280 --> 2:33:35.200]  That's not what they want.
[2:33:35.200 --> 2:33:38.120]  Instead they want immunity for the police, just like they want immunity for these big
[2:33:38.120 --> 2:33:40.640]  pharmaceutical people, and we shouldn't allow that to happen.
[2:33:40.640 --> 2:33:42.960]  We'll be right back.
[2:33:42.960 --> 2:33:50.240]  Allergies, dander, asthma, germs, toxins, there are many reasons why we need to think
[2:33:50.240 --> 2:33:52.840]  about what is really in the air around us.
[2:33:52.840 --> 2:33:57.240]  You may not be able to stop breathing, but we can control what's in the air we breathe.

[2:37:40.040 --> 2:37:46.280]  Ah, anyways, it's all at infowarsstore.com.
[2:37:46.280 --> 2:37:56.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:37:56.080 --> 2:38:11.040]  Alright, this is our last segment and Matt Bracken is going to be taking over in the
[2:38:11.040 --> 2:38:12.040]  next segment.
[2:38:12.040 --> 2:38:13.040]  Enemy is foreignanddomestic.com.
[2:38:13.040 --> 2:38:19.880]  I'm sure Matt is going to have what to say about the escalation of force on both sides
[2:38:19.880 --> 2:38:20.880]  and proposals for that.
[2:38:20.880 --> 2:38:25.040]  I'm going to talk a little bit about what is happening in terms of the hate in this
[2:38:25.040 --> 2:38:30.200]  segment, but before we do, I'll quickly remind you about the products we have at infowarsstore.com
[2:38:30.200 --> 2:38:32.200]  because that's how we fund this operation.
[2:38:32.200 --> 2:38:38.800]  So Google would like to shut us down trying to do that to a zero head, trying to do that
[2:38:38.800 --> 2:38:47.320]  to the Federalist, but we depend on the products that you buy, the contributions that you make,
[2:38:47.320 --> 2:38:48.640]  but especially the products that you buy.
[2:38:48.640 --> 2:38:53.800]  I mean, you can't make a direct contribution, we do have that set up, but primarily what
[2:38:53.800 --> 2:38:57.720]  we do is we try to give you products that are going to help you to prepare for the types
[2:38:57.720 --> 2:39:03.240]  of situations that we see now already rolling out across the country as well as to prepare
[2:39:03.240 --> 2:39:04.240]  your health.
[2:39:04.240 --> 2:39:10.160]  Isn't it interesting that as we see both threats to your health and to your safety that we have
[2:39:10.160 --> 2:39:12.200]  products to help you prepare for that.
[2:39:12.200 --> 2:39:17.240]  And again, when you look at your health, just make sure that you have given yourself the
[2:39:17.240 --> 2:39:25.040]  right kinds of nutrition, naturally, nutraceuticals, natural, effective, safe, and right now very
[2:39:25.040 --> 2:39:27.440]  effective in terms of price.
[2:39:27.440 --> 2:39:29.600]  We've got still some great discounts.
[2:39:29.600 --> 2:39:33.720]  We've got 70% off of our AMPM day and night pack.
[2:39:33.720 --> 2:39:37.720]  That's the eight-packed power stack we call it, but it's got supplements that you can
[2:39:37.720 --> 2:39:41.080]  take in the morning to help you wake up, to help you focus, other supplements that you
[2:39:41.080 --> 2:39:47.200]  take at night that are going to help you to relax, maybe to sleep, natural, safe, effective,
[2:39:47.200 --> 2:39:50.400]  and now 70% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:39:50.400 --> 2:39:55.880]  We also have all of our InfoWars t-shirts available at cost at $9.95.
[2:39:55.880 --> 2:39:58.840]  And we have our storeable food.
[2:39:58.840 --> 2:40:01.920]  It is a storeable for up to 25 years if you don't need it.

[2:40:05.800 --> 2:40:10.040]  lead time right now that we've had for months at InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:40:10.040 --> 2:40:13.240]  All right, let's talk about what is happening across the country.
[2:40:13.240 --> 2:40:17.440]  You know, I see Jefferson statues being attacked, and they say, well, we've got to rename the
[2:40:17.440 --> 2:40:24.720]  schools and get rid of the names of Jefferson and Washington that were used.
[2:40:24.720 --> 2:40:32.920]  And I look at this statue of Jefferson toppled at a Portland high school, and the garbage
[2:40:32.920 --> 2:40:38.680]  there, the spray painting and the statue laying on the ground, and I think, you know,
[2:40:38.680 --> 2:40:41.320]  what have these people ever done?
[2:40:41.320 --> 2:40:43.400]  Do they know?
[2:40:43.400 --> 2:40:45.400]  They're probably functionally illiterate.
[2:40:45.400 --> 2:40:46.640]  They know nothing about history.
[2:40:46.640 --> 2:40:50.360]  Do they know what Jefferson contributed?
[2:40:50.360 --> 2:40:53.120]  Are they going to be able to make that kind of contribution?
[2:40:53.120 --> 2:40:55.520]  Or are they just going to destroy stuff?
[2:40:55.520 --> 2:40:58.560]  You know, Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence.
[2:40:58.560 --> 2:41:04.080]  He actually attacked slavery as part of that, but he laid a foundation for individual liberty.
[2:41:04.080 --> 2:41:08.320]  These people are laying a foundation for slavery.
[2:41:08.320 --> 2:41:14.160]  He also was the thing he was most proud of was his Virginia statute for religious freedom.
[2:41:14.160 --> 2:41:16.760]  He founded the University of Virginia.
[2:41:16.760 --> 2:41:20.400]  That's his mistake.
[2:41:20.400 --> 2:41:25.400]  I've argued that with, at Colonial Williamsburg, they have actors who do that.
[2:41:25.400 --> 2:41:31.320]  I had a great guy who did a great thing with Jefferson, and he would take questions from
[2:41:31.320 --> 2:41:35.960]  the audience, but if you asked him something that was about current events, he would not
[2:41:35.960 --> 2:41:36.960]  reply to you.
[2:41:36.960 --> 2:41:40.120]  So I had asked him a question, because it was a rhetorical question, and I just wanted
[2:41:40.120 --> 2:41:42.080]  to get the statement out.
[2:41:42.080 --> 2:41:48.120]  Since Jefferson had talked about public funding of educational institutions, I would just
[2:41:48.120 --> 2:41:49.120]  throw it out to him.
[2:41:49.120 --> 2:41:52.560]  I did it a couple of times, various places.
[2:41:52.560 --> 2:41:57.880]  He would come and speak to conservative or libertarian organizations, and I did it a
[2:41:57.880 --> 2:41:58.880]  couple of times there.
[2:41:58.880 --> 2:42:04.680]  I did it just at gatherings at Colonial Williamsburg, but I had always asked him the question.
[2:42:04.680 --> 2:42:12.880]  I would say, well, you were against forcing people to pay for a church that they didn't
[2:42:12.880 --> 2:42:17.760]  believe in, because we had, in terms of establishing a religion, what they're really talking about
[2:42:17.760 --> 2:42:23.760]  is forcing people, in some states, you were forced to attend a particular church.
[2:42:23.760 --> 2:42:30.120]  In other states, you may not, the more liberal ones, you were not forced to attend a church,
[2:42:30.120 --> 2:42:36.000]  but you were still forced to pay money to that established church, and all of the states
[2:42:36.000 --> 2:42:38.880]  that created the federal government, they all had established religions.
[2:42:38.880 --> 2:42:45.240]  As a matter of fact, it persisted in Massachusetts, and one other state, I think it was Connecticut,
[2:42:45.240 --> 2:42:46.360]  well into the 1800s.
[2:42:46.360 --> 2:42:53.240]  I think the established state church in Massachusetts continued into the 1840s.
[2:42:53.240 --> 2:42:56.080]  But I don't agree with that.
[2:42:56.080 --> 2:43:03.520]  And didn't agree with that, but I said, if you have a school that is funded by the government,
[2:43:03.520 --> 2:43:08.280]  and that includes our K through 12, not just the universities, I said, what you're doing
[2:43:08.280 --> 2:43:11.040]  is you're really teaching values to people, aren't you?
[2:43:11.040 --> 2:43:13.760]  Whose values are you teaching?
[2:43:13.760 --> 2:43:16.000]  What is the fundamental religion that you're teaching?
[2:43:16.000 --> 2:43:19.400]  Are you teaching Christianity, Islam, are you teaching secular humanism?
[2:43:19.400 --> 2:43:25.880]  If you use state funds to do this, isn't that as reprehensible as using state funds
[2:43:25.880 --> 2:43:27.160]  to fund a church?
[2:43:27.160 --> 2:43:33.080]  Well, I know nothing of this place that you're talking about, but he would always say.
[2:43:33.080 --> 2:43:35.360]  But basically, that was his fundamental problem.
[2:43:35.360 --> 2:43:40.760]  But they're toppling statues of Thomas Jefferson, and at the University of Portland, you know,
[2:43:40.760 --> 2:43:45.320]  this is the higher education, they are so enlightened that they're actually removing
[2:43:45.320 --> 2:43:48.720]  the slave that was part of the Lewis and Clark expedition.
[2:43:48.720 --> 2:43:54.120]  You know, they had a statue there, they had one of the guys, Lewis or Clark, had Captain
[2:43:54.120 --> 2:43:58.040]  Clark, and on his right hand, he's standing there, and the three of them were side by
[2:43:58.040 --> 2:43:59.040]  side.
[2:43:59.040 --> 2:44:01.880]  See if you can find a picture of the original statue.
[2:44:01.880 --> 2:44:06.600]  They've removed the slave, you still have Captain Clark there, and you still have an
[2:44:06.600 --> 2:44:10.720]  Indian on the right-hand side, but on his left-hand side, there was also a slave, and
[2:44:10.720 --> 2:44:12.680]  they were all standing next to each other.
[2:44:12.680 --> 2:44:17.360]  It wasn't that anybody was in a subordinate position kneeling down or anything.
[2:44:17.360 --> 2:44:22.680]  They didn't have the slave kneeling like he was an NFL player.
[2:44:22.680 --> 2:44:29.080]  No, he was standing up like an equal, and they removed him, because you know what they're
[2:44:29.080 --> 2:44:33.800]  doing now is they're now destroying anti-slavery figures.
[2:44:33.800 --> 2:44:38.840]  As a matter of fact, I like what the Babylon Bee said in terms of satire.
[2:44:38.840 --> 2:44:44.480]  It's really true, activists fight racism by driving all people of color out of pop culture.
[2:44:44.480 --> 2:44:46.240]  That's what they're doing at the University of Portland.
[2:44:46.240 --> 2:44:50.520]  They took, there he is, he's on the, you can see him, he's the one closest to the camera
[2:44:50.520 --> 2:44:51.520]  there.
[2:44:51.520 --> 2:44:52.520]  He's standing there.
[2:44:52.520 --> 2:44:53.800]  They removed the black guy.
[2:44:53.800 --> 2:45:01.400]  We don't want to have a statue that shows a black man, an American, the Captain Clark,
[2:45:01.400 --> 2:45:04.760]  and the Indian is part of an American display there.
[2:45:04.760 --> 2:45:07.360]  We don't want to show people working together.
[2:45:07.360 --> 2:45:08.440]  We don't want a melting pot.
[2:45:08.440 --> 2:45:10.440]  We don't want a community working together.
[2:45:10.440 --> 2:45:12.840]  We got to isolate and tear down anything that shows that.
[2:45:12.840 --> 2:45:17.040]  So they're going to remove the first thing they did was remove the black guy, and that
[2:45:17.040 --> 2:45:19.000]  was a Babylon Bee headline.
[2:45:19.000 --> 2:45:22.880]  They just fight racism by driving all people of color out of pop culture, talking about
[2:45:22.880 --> 2:45:28.480]  Aunt Jemima, the land of lakes, Uncle Ben's, the Simpsons.
[2:45:28.480 --> 2:45:29.880]  I mean, they've done that already.
[2:45:29.880 --> 2:45:31.280]  I mean, this is not satire.
[2:45:31.280 --> 2:45:35.120]  This is the idiocracy that we live in, and that's what they're doing at the University
[2:45:35.120 --> 2:45:36.120]  of Portland.
[2:45:36.120 --> 2:45:43.800]  You got software host GitHub now banning the terms master and slave from programming code.
[2:45:43.800 --> 2:45:48.360]  That's not pushing slavery.
[2:45:48.360 --> 2:45:53.400]  Well, that will happen if you get Robocops, but no, are they going to change the other
[2:45:53.400 --> 2:45:55.720]  terms, things like demon and virus?
[2:45:55.720 --> 2:45:58.960]  These are just, they're descriptive.
[2:45:58.960 --> 2:46:01.880]  Like a demon is something that you start and it runs in the background.
[2:46:01.880 --> 2:46:05.680]  You don't really, and that's pretty descriptive.
[2:46:05.680 --> 2:46:10.440]  And then a virus is something that somebody else gives you that puts on your computer
[2:46:10.440 --> 2:46:11.440]  system.
[2:46:11.440 --> 2:46:16.440]  But no, they're destroying the statues of leading anti-slavery figures.
[2:46:16.440 --> 2:46:21.960]  You know, I talked about this at length on the morning program.
[2:46:21.960 --> 2:46:25.480]  By the way, if you want to hear that, it's 9 to noon Eastern time.
[2:46:25.480 --> 2:46:28.600]  Mathias Baldwin, I talked a great deal about this guy.
[2:46:28.600 --> 2:46:35.040]  He had a great life, and he rose up from a position of poverty, not using any slaves,
[2:46:35.040 --> 2:46:37.360]  but using engineering.
[2:46:37.360 --> 2:46:43.360]  And they became a Christian, and they became an abolitionist, and he started educational
[2:46:43.360 --> 2:46:50.040]  establishments and paid for them himself to educate black people.
[2:46:50.040 --> 2:46:55.720]  And he hired black people when people weren't doing that in his area.
[2:46:55.720 --> 2:46:58.020]  They came after his statue.
[2:46:58.020 --> 2:46:59.680]  This is not about the Civil War.
[2:46:59.680 --> 2:47:03.480]  They're coming after people like Admiral Farragut.
[2:47:03.480 --> 2:47:07.800]  And you got popular mechanics, this story that's on Infowars.
[2:47:07.800 --> 2:47:10.360]  Popular mechanics, publishing advice on how to topple statues.
[2:47:10.360 --> 2:47:14.280]  You can take them down physically, or you can do it chemically, you can destroy them.
[2:47:14.280 --> 2:47:19.000]  That's what we're focused on right now, folks, just destroying everything.
[2:47:19.000 --> 2:47:24.560]  And what is so concerning about this is that it's not just the useful, youthful idiots
[2:47:24.560 --> 2:47:25.560]  at the bottom.
[2:47:25.560 --> 2:47:31.080]  It's the people at top, like Tim Kaine, who would have been our vice president if Hillary
[2:47:31.080 --> 2:47:32.080]  Clinton had won.
[2:47:32.080 --> 2:47:39.320]  And he's out there putting out the hatred that the U.S. didn't invent slavery.
[2:47:39.320 --> 2:47:45.120]  Let's roll the clip of what happened in Houston, because we're almost out of time here.
[2:47:45.120 --> 2:47:49.920]  Show people what happens with this mob attacking the guys who walks out of a convenience store.
[2:47:49.920 --> 2:47:50.920]  Why?
[2:47:50.920 --> 2:47:53.880]  Well, he's white, and they're black.
[2:47:53.880 --> 2:47:55.360]  And this is the end result, folks.
[2:47:55.360 --> 2:47:59.760]  We're not talking about people physically attacking statues.
[2:47:59.760 --> 2:48:06.320]  This is all being done so that we can route the mob to attack people based on the color
[2:48:06.320 --> 2:48:08.200]  of their skin.
[2:48:08.200 --> 2:48:14.160]  And this is the logical extension of what Tim Kaine is trying to force our country into.
[2:48:14.160 --> 2:48:16.320]  And a lot of people are taking the bait.
[2:48:16.320 --> 2:48:18.920]  A lot of people, both black and white.
[2:48:18.920 --> 2:48:20.840]  Well, that's it for the broadcast.
[2:48:20.840 --> 2:48:21.840]  My part of it.
[2:48:21.840 --> 2:48:25.640]  Matt Bracken will be joining you in the next segment, enemies, foreign, and domestic.com.
[2:48:25.640 --> 2:48:32.160]  Thanks for listening.
[2:48:32.160 --> 2:48:35.440]  The people of the world have awakened to globalism.
[2:48:35.440 --> 2:48:40.600]  And so populist movements are throwing the globalist out of their countries.
[2:48:40.600 --> 2:48:45.080]  That's why the New World Order is instituting race war and division and telling the people
[2:48:45.080 --> 2:48:50.440]  that rebellion is about overthrowing your local police and government and destroying
[2:48:50.440 --> 2:48:52.400]  essential services.
[2:48:52.400 --> 2:48:56.400]  This is an attempt to have society collapse.
[2:48:56.400 --> 2:48:59.680]  And the globalists, as they've done in the third world, will come in and pick up the
[2:48:59.680 --> 2:49:00.680]  pieces.
[2:49:00.680 --> 2:49:05.800]  They must stand against the UN, the IMF, the World Bank, and the EU openly saying they
[2:49:05.800 --> 2:49:07.200]  fund the police.
[2:49:07.200 --> 2:49:08.560]  The police have a lot of problems.
[2:49:08.560 --> 2:49:09.960]  We all have a lot of problems.
[2:49:09.960 --> 2:49:12.680]  But this is our government and our localist tabulary.
[2:49:12.680 --> 2:49:17.360]  And believe me, once the globalists have overthrown this country, they are going to put in a real
[2:49:17.360 --> 2:49:19.640]  police state where you have no due process or freedom.
[2:49:19.640 --> 2:49:23.440]  The globalists believe communist China is the model of the world.
[2:49:23.440 --> 2:49:25.560]  And they are orchestrating this entire thing.
[2:49:25.560 --> 2:49:31.560]  The people helping them are collaborators and are idiots and must be opposed, infowars.com.
[2:49:55.560 --> 2:50:05.560]  This is an attempt to have society collapse.
[2:50:05.560 --> 2:50:15.560]  The globalists believe communist China is the model of the world.
[2:50:15.560 --> 2:50:36.560]  The globalists believe communist China is the model of the world.
[2:50:36.560 --> 2:50:51.400]  Listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:50:51.400 --> 2:50:58.240]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[2:50:58.240 --> 2:51:02.800]  And now, your host, Matt Bracken.
[2:51:02.800 --> 2:51:12.760]  Okay, you've got me for the next hour, and I've been writing about this for the last
[2:51:12.760 --> 2:51:13.760]  15 years.
[2:51:13.760 --> 2:51:14.960]  And here we are.
[2:51:14.960 --> 2:51:19.480]  We're actually in this revolutionary moment now.
[2:51:19.480 --> 2:51:27.920]  It sort of reads like some of my novels, which at the time were considered hyperbolic and
[2:51:27.920 --> 2:51:31.720]  fiction that could never happen, not in the United States of America.
[2:51:31.720 --> 2:51:33.240]  But it is happening.
[2:51:33.240 --> 2:51:39.680]  And during this hour, I'm going to zoom in to, like, antifotactics and then zoom out
[2:51:39.680 --> 2:51:47.360]  to the historical perspective and zoom even further out to who benefits from this situation.
[2:51:47.360 --> 2:51:53.560]  And starting right now at the very macro, there's no doubt that the globalists and the
[2:51:53.560 --> 2:51:57.400]  Chinese communists are both fomenting this.
[2:51:57.400 --> 2:52:00.680]  Both of them think that they will come out on top.
[2:52:00.680 --> 2:52:06.620]  The Chinese communists think that the globalists are useful idiots, capitalists who are selling
[2:52:06.620 --> 2:52:11.520]  them the rope to hang the rest of the world with.
[2:52:11.520 --> 2:52:18.680]  And the globalists think that there is just a, almost like a religious reformation going
[2:52:18.680 --> 2:52:20.760]  on globally.
[2:52:20.760 --> 2:52:25.880]  And it's a secular religion, but they're as fanatical as any religious zealots ever
[2:52:25.880 --> 2:52:31.880]  were, and that they have to destroy the concept of the nation-state.
[2:52:31.880 --> 2:52:38.560]  Open borders for population flow, open borders for trade, they'll benefit the globalists
[2:52:38.560 --> 2:52:41.960]  think because they'll run the entire economic order.
[2:52:41.960 --> 2:52:47.680]  Meanwhile, the Chinese tiger is looking at them and saying, do lots of my work for me
[2:52:47.680 --> 2:52:53.040]  and we'll be around to collect the pieces when the shooting is all over, when the shooting
[2:52:53.040 --> 2:53:00.920]  and dying is all over, while watching, watching David show last hour, obviously he's dead
[2:53:00.920 --> 2:53:02.520]  on the money.
[2:53:02.520 --> 2:53:08.360]  We are going to see things that if you think that the first half of 2020 was amazing, some
[2:53:08.360 --> 2:53:16.000]  people say the first few months of 2020 were like a decade, well, we're just gearing up.
[2:53:16.000 --> 2:53:18.960]  The election isn't until November.
[2:53:18.960 --> 2:53:25.880]  And the election is really going to be the battle, the main battle of our lifetime.
[2:53:25.880 --> 2:53:33.080]  Because after the unfortunate death of George Floyd, you know, with the knee on his neck,
[2:53:33.080 --> 2:53:40.640]  this was taken as the go code, the activation code for Marxists all over the world.
[2:53:40.640 --> 2:53:47.240]  Now they can, they can at various times come right out and call themselves Marxists, and
[2:53:47.240 --> 2:53:55.320]  at other times they retreat behind camouflage using, using cut out foundations and organizations.
[2:53:55.320 --> 2:53:58.720]  But when you watch the money, you see where it comes from.
[2:53:58.720 --> 2:54:04.360]  The money comes from, from these globalist corporations that are working hand in glove
[2:54:04.360 --> 2:54:10.400]  with the Chinese communists, companies like Google and YouTube that would love to absolutely
[2:54:10.400 --> 2:54:18.000]  crush the last vestige of freedom and make no doubt, America is the last citadel.
[2:54:18.000 --> 2:54:20.000]  America is the redoubt.
[2:54:20.000 --> 2:54:24.880]  If you think that America can collapse into anarchy and then tyranny either from the
[2:54:24.880 --> 2:54:29.680]  left or the right, and the rest of the world would be unscathed that you can take off to
[2:54:29.680 --> 2:54:36.040]  Uruguay or New Zealand, and your life will just go on placidly as before.
[2:54:36.040 --> 2:54:43.120]  If America goes down, then countries like, like Uruguay or New Zealand will be picked
[2:54:43.120 --> 2:54:45.760]  off like low hanging fruit.
[2:54:45.760 --> 2:54:47.920]  They won't last a decade.
[2:54:47.920 --> 2:54:49.360]  They'll be gone too.
[2:54:49.360 --> 2:54:51.960]  So this really is the battle.
[2:54:51.960 --> 2:54:59.240]  And this is the period where I would compare it to 1920s Germany.
[2:54:59.240 --> 2:55:01.600]  When the street fighting begins.
[2:55:01.600 --> 2:55:09.080]  It's no coincidence that Antifa uses the same communist inspired logo as the communists
[2:55:09.080 --> 2:55:15.280]  who were engaged in the street fighting against the national socialists in the 1920s.
[2:55:15.280 --> 2:55:16.840]  It's no coincidence.
[2:55:16.840 --> 2:55:18.560]  It's the same people.
[2:55:18.560 --> 2:55:24.000]  It's just, it's flowered at the roots of continued generation upon generation.
[2:55:24.000 --> 2:55:27.240]  They've won the long march through the institutions.
[2:55:27.240 --> 2:55:30.800]  They've turned our children against their own country.
[2:55:30.800 --> 2:55:33.880]  And now we're going to reap the bitter fruit.
[2:55:33.880 --> 2:55:37.120]  And that's what I'm going to talk about in the next segment.
[2:55:37.120 --> 2:55:49.200]  Aerodyne technology delivery system, the first of its kind pure nascent atomic iodine that
[2:55:49.200 --> 2:55:51.720]  can be delivered through a spray bottle.
[2:55:51.720 --> 2:55:57.800]  The next level of innovation of X2 is here introducing survival shield X2 spray.
[2:55:57.800 --> 2:56:00.960]  The great part about the X2 spray is it's great on the go.
[2:56:00.960 --> 2:56:03.560]  When you've got it in the dropper, it's great at your house.
[2:56:03.560 --> 2:56:06.520]  It's great at work, but this is great for the car.
[2:56:06.520 --> 2:56:08.320]  It's great to keep with you.
[2:56:08.320 --> 2:56:12.960]  And again, it's also good for the throat and mouth to get the effects of iodine not to
[2:56:12.960 --> 2:56:14.520]  just ingest it into the stomach.
[2:56:14.520 --> 2:56:16.000]  We're really excited about it.
[2:56:16.000 --> 2:56:18.160]  It's 33% off out of the gates.
[2:56:18.160 --> 2:56:22.600]  It was listeners idea asking for us to come up with a spray bottle that had us talk to
[2:56:22.600 --> 2:56:26.680]  the scientists and developers and come up with a system that aerosolizes it and delivers
[2:56:26.680 --> 2:56:30.200]  it to the body in a new and in some ways even better way.
[2:56:30.200 --> 2:56:36.400]  Get your survival shield X2 nascent iodine spray now at 33% off at infowarstore.com and
[2:56:36.400 --> 2:56:52.840]  experience the power of aerosolized X2 nascent iodine for yourself.
[2:56:52.840 --> 2:56:58.480]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[2:56:58.480 --> 2:57:01.120]  It's Matt Bracken.
[2:57:01.120 --> 2:57:08.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show about the historical roots of Antifa.
[2:57:08.120 --> 2:57:14.000]  Speaking about the historical roots of Antifa from the 1920s, a century all the way through
[2:57:14.000 --> 2:57:17.280]  till the 2020s.
[2:57:17.280 --> 2:57:23.080]  Antonio Gramsci was Italian communist in the early part of the 20th century that was actually
[2:57:23.080 --> 2:57:27.800]  in the long run a lot smarter than Lenin and Stalin.
[2:57:27.800 --> 2:57:33.640]  They believed that they could crush the world with communism just using subversion tactics,
[2:57:33.640 --> 2:57:36.280]  infiltrating agents, creating chaos.
[2:57:36.280 --> 2:57:43.480]  Gramsci understood that countries like Italy had too much love of their own patria.
[2:57:43.480 --> 2:57:44.600]  They loved their church.
[2:57:44.600 --> 2:57:47.000]  They loved their culture, their language.
[2:57:47.000 --> 2:57:53.280]  They weren't going to be taken in by Boris and Natasha sneaking in and committing sabotage
[2:57:53.280 --> 2:57:55.480]  and assassination.
[2:57:55.480 --> 2:57:57.520]  That's exactly what happened.
[2:57:57.520 --> 2:58:04.000]  At the end of World War II it looked like the red sickle was going to sweep across Europe,
[2:58:04.000 --> 2:58:05.840]  but we stopped it.
[2:58:05.840 --> 2:58:10.240]  People didn't want to be forced into communist subjugation.
[2:58:10.240 --> 2:58:17.640]  Antonio Gramsci, along with the Fabians in England and the Frankfurt School in Germany,
[2:58:17.640 --> 2:58:24.840]  which was transplanted to the American university system, they understood that to collapse the
[2:58:24.840 --> 2:58:28.280]  West it had to be an inside job.
[2:58:28.280 --> 2:58:36.160]  They had to take over all of our cultural institutions, our education system, and spread
[2:58:36.160 --> 2:58:43.160]  this rot, this communist rot, all through every layer of our society so that eventually
[2:58:43.160 --> 2:58:48.680]  when the crisis came, Americans wouldn't even defend America.
[2:58:48.680 --> 2:58:52.280]  I used the analogy of the parasitic wasp.
[2:58:52.280 --> 2:58:57.800]  I don't know if any of you have ever seen this meme, but the Soviet Union, when we think
[2:58:57.800 --> 2:59:02.280]  of winning the Cold War, did the Soviet Union lose?
[2:59:02.280 --> 2:59:10.720]  Perhaps they're gone, but what they did while they were in a powerful communist subversion
[2:59:10.720 --> 2:59:17.400]  force, they spread the poison into our body so that our children are coming out of our
[2:59:17.400 --> 2:59:21.440]  universities as little malice-red guards.
[2:59:21.440 --> 2:59:23.640]  Make no mistake, that's what this is.
[2:59:23.640 --> 2:59:31.000]  This is something completely new in America, where I mean I have relatives who do not defend
[2:59:31.000 --> 2:59:33.000]  the First Amendment.
[2:59:33.000 --> 2:59:39.560]  When they hear about Zero Hedge and the Federalists being taken or attempted to be taken down
[2:59:39.560 --> 2:59:42.920]  by NBC and Google, they cheer for it.
[2:59:42.920 --> 2:59:49.640]  They think that right-wingers are so dangerous that we shouldn't be given a platform.
[2:59:49.640 --> 2:59:56.040]  They are so brainwashed that they actually are encouraging these monuments being taken
[2:59:56.040 --> 2:59:58.040]  down.
[2:59:58.040 --> 3:00:03.360]  This is another thing about blowing up our education system.
[3:00:03.360 --> 3:00:07.000]  We have children that have no historical background.
[3:00:07.000 --> 3:00:09.880]  They can't put a context on any of this.
[3:00:09.880 --> 3:00:16.480]  All they can hear is, this guy owns slaves, therefore the statue has to come down.
[3:00:16.480 --> 3:00:21.040]  Nowhere in their education are they taught that slavery existed throughout human history
[3:00:21.040 --> 3:00:28.360]  and every culture on every continent, and that it was the English and later the Americans
[3:00:28.360 --> 3:00:31.040]  who stamped it out and abolished it.
[3:00:31.040 --> 3:00:38.160]  It was Europeans that went into Africa in the 19th and 20th century and stamped it out.
[3:00:38.160 --> 3:00:44.600]  Slavery was still legal in Saudi Arabia and several African countries until the 1960s,
[3:00:44.600 --> 3:00:50.760]  and now it's making a comeback in some countries like Mauritania and Libya, open slave markets.
[3:00:50.760 --> 3:00:54.920]  But our children do not get any of that historical context.
[3:00:54.920 --> 3:00:59.880]  This is sort of like Cambodia in the 70s, starting with a year zero.
[3:00:59.880 --> 3:01:02.240]  We're going to only accept perfect human beings.
[3:01:02.240 --> 3:01:07.680]  But let me tell you, there's a danger to this for everyone because eventually it could
[3:01:07.680 --> 3:01:12.600]  come to the point that only vegans can be memorialized.
[3:01:12.600 --> 3:01:17.600]  Anybody who is ever a bloodthirsty meat eater, his statue will have to be torn down.
[3:01:17.600 --> 3:01:20.240]  That would include Martin Luther King and others.
[3:01:20.240 --> 3:01:28.200]  It never ends once you get into this purity spiral of the Jacobin, French Revolution
[3:01:28.200 --> 3:01:33.880]  style of ever greater demands for perfect equality.
[3:01:33.880 --> 3:01:35.680]  It doesn't end.
[3:01:35.680 --> 3:01:43.760]  It doesn't end until the cannibals have feasted on each other and the society has collapsed.
[3:01:43.760 --> 3:01:50.760]  However, the other way it can end is with a right-wing reaction and getting a general pentachat.
[3:01:50.760 --> 3:01:58.040]  This is a very dangerous period we're in because right now we have generals who are in collaboration.
[3:01:58.040 --> 3:02:04.960]  I'm convinced people like Petraeus McRaven on the outside, people like Millie on the
[3:02:04.960 --> 3:02:10.680]  inside that are outwardly showing disloyalty to the commander-in-chief.
[3:02:10.680 --> 3:02:16.600]  There's been a hallmark of our country that we elect presidents and the military abides
[3:02:16.600 --> 3:02:18.480]  by their decisions.
[3:02:18.480 --> 3:02:25.160]  We have a general of the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who is submitting and bowing
[3:02:25.160 --> 3:02:26.160]  the knee.
[3:02:26.160 --> 3:02:29.120]  In a sense, he pulled a drew breeze.
[3:02:29.120 --> 3:02:32.640]  He pulled an Oklahoma State University coach.
[3:02:32.640 --> 3:02:38.960]  He got down and he begged for forgiveness for walking with Trump to a church that the
[3:02:38.960 --> 3:02:45.400]  Antifa communists had tried to burn down just two blocks from the White House.
[3:02:45.400 --> 3:02:50.040]  Imagine a Civil War general saying, I'm sorry, I can't walk with Lincoln.
[3:02:50.040 --> 3:02:51.600]  That would be seen as political.
[3:02:51.600 --> 3:02:52.600]  It's insane.
[3:02:52.600 --> 3:02:57.000]  There were war-like conditions around the very White House.
[3:02:57.000 --> 3:03:04.080]  Something like 60 Secret Service personnel were injured some grievously by having five-pound
[3:03:04.080 --> 3:03:08.400]  and ten-pound bricks thrown at them en masse.
[3:03:08.400 --> 3:03:10.040]  We don't hear anything about this.
[3:03:10.040 --> 3:03:18.080]  We are rapidly reaching a 1920s Germany moment where there's going to be open street fighting
[3:03:18.080 --> 3:03:19.440]  with guns.
[3:03:19.440 --> 3:03:22.880]  We've already seen just an inkling of it.
[3:03:22.880 --> 3:03:29.000]  This is, I think, two days ago in Albuquerque where the police are refusing to defend any
[3:03:29.000 --> 3:03:33.160]  civil property, not your jewelry store, not a statue.
[3:03:33.160 --> 3:03:35.480]  The police are out of it.
[3:03:35.480 --> 3:03:37.120]  They're standing down.
[3:03:37.120 --> 3:03:45.120]  So it was left to volunteer self-appointed civilian militia to try to defend the statue
[3:03:45.120 --> 3:03:47.880]  of a conquistador in Albuquerque.
[3:03:47.880 --> 3:03:53.240]  The mob outnumbered the self-appointed militia.
[3:03:53.240 --> 3:03:55.320]  They were driven away.
[3:03:55.320 --> 3:04:02.440]  One of the people that was attending was at the point of being beaten to death and knifed
[3:04:02.440 --> 3:04:04.440]  and he defended himself with a pistol.
[3:04:04.440 --> 3:04:06.840]  So it's getting that close.
[3:04:06.840 --> 3:04:12.680]  In South Philadelphia, Italians are defending the Christopher Columbus statue.
[3:04:12.680 --> 3:04:17.120]  They're saying, you'll have to come through us if you want to take down that statue.
[3:04:17.120 --> 3:04:18.880]  And they're carrying guns.
[3:04:18.880 --> 3:04:22.640]  I mean, this is something new in America.
[3:04:22.640 --> 3:04:26.560]  And we're only in the early innings of this.
[3:04:26.560 --> 3:04:31.520]  We still have this pandemic rolling through where they're going to possibly try locking
[3:04:31.520 --> 3:04:34.200]  down, which nobody will ever believe now.
[3:04:34.200 --> 3:04:36.320]  The lockdown is never going to happen again.
[3:04:36.320 --> 3:04:39.640]  It doesn't mean you have to go to a restaurant if you don't want to.
[3:04:39.640 --> 3:04:44.760]  But restaurants are going to say the hell with being closed by law when you allow rioters
[3:04:44.760 --> 3:04:48.840]  to smash windows and do anything that they want.
[3:04:48.840 --> 3:04:57.120]  So this is absolutely a moment in history when you have to be on the alert.
[3:04:57.120 --> 3:05:04.400]  If you're even driving across a freeway or downtown avenue, you're going to have to
[3:05:04.400 --> 3:05:10.600]  be on the alert that you could be stopped in traffic and yanked out of your car and
[3:05:10.600 --> 3:05:14.040]  beaten in the United States of America.
[3:05:14.040 --> 3:05:19.440]  And the Marxist mainstream media has to take a lot of the blame for this because they have
[3:05:19.440 --> 3:05:25.760]  absolutely been pouring gasoline on the flames of this racial hatred.
[3:05:25.760 --> 3:05:31.440]  If you look at the actual data and numbers of white on black crime compared to black
[3:05:31.440 --> 3:05:36.160]  on white crime, it's completely out of proportion to reality.
[3:05:36.160 --> 3:05:43.240]  But the media puts the telescope on the incidents that do happen and just whip and whip and
[3:05:43.240 --> 3:05:48.640]  whip the racial fervor to the point where elderly people are just getting beaten on
[3:05:48.640 --> 3:05:51.000]  the sidewalk or in stores.
[3:05:51.000 --> 3:05:53.760]  People are being yanked out of cars.
[3:05:53.760 --> 3:05:56.800]  And the saying is get the whitey.
[3:05:56.800 --> 3:06:00.480]  I mean, this is crazy in this country that it's coming to this.
[3:06:00.480 --> 3:06:06.000]  But we have got to be ready for what's coming next because we're just starting to see the
[3:06:06.000 --> 3:06:11.600]  beginning of the kinetic phase of what's going to happen between now and November.
[3:06:11.600 --> 3:06:15.640]  Because believe me, the White House is the great prize.
[3:06:15.640 --> 3:06:23.040]  If Biden somehow, if his senile carcass is dragged over the finish line and he is elected,
[3:06:23.040 --> 3:06:30.200]  we are going to see this country run by the Obamas, by Valerie Jarrett, by the Black
[3:06:30.200 --> 3:06:33.280]  Lives Matter and Antifa supporting senators.
[3:06:33.280 --> 3:06:37.040]  This is absolutely going to be the end of the country as we know it.
[3:06:37.040 --> 3:07:05.720]  And I'll get back to the next part of this right after the break.
[3:07:05.720 --> 3:07:14.720]  This is a totally sickening, disgusting joke.
[3:07:14.720 --> 3:07:18.760]  You ever heard the saying, keep your friends close, enemies closer.
[3:07:18.760 --> 3:07:21.120]  Leftists are evil and they divide and conquer people.
[3:07:21.120 --> 3:07:26.920]  But at the heart of them is a eugenics-based depopulation operation.
[3:07:26.920 --> 3:07:31.520]  Why aren't Black Lives Matter at Cold Springs Harbor in New York where they run the whole
[3:07:31.520 --> 3:07:33.720]  operation trying to topple statues?
[3:07:33.720 --> 3:07:35.640]  Why aren't they at the United Nations?
[3:07:35.640 --> 3:07:39.840]  Because they're controlled by the UN and being directed by their masters.
[3:07:39.840 --> 3:07:43.240]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut.
[3:07:43.240 --> 3:07:44.240]  You're on the air.
[3:07:44.240 --> 3:07:45.240]  Thanks for holding.
[3:07:45.240 --> 3:07:46.240]  Hello.
[3:07:46.240 --> 3:07:47.240]  Can you hear me?
[3:07:47.240 --> 3:07:48.240]  I sure can, sir.
[3:07:48.240 --> 3:07:49.240]  Thank you.
[3:07:49.240 --> 3:07:50.240]  Hey, Alex.
[3:07:50.240 --> 3:07:52.240]  Before I start, man, I just wanted to talk to you, bro, and it's a pleasure to be talking
[3:07:52.240 --> 3:07:53.240]  right now with you, man.
[3:07:53.240 --> 3:07:54.240]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[3:07:54.240 --> 3:07:58.240]  I'm from New Brink, Connecticut, and I just want to plug in.
[3:07:58.240 --> 3:08:02.840]  I'm a truck driver, and two before us have changed the way I drive.
[3:08:02.840 --> 3:08:08.840]  Me and my brothers that drive, with a couple of us, we are Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans.
[3:08:08.840 --> 3:08:15.440]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and Rolla, and I have lost weight because I stopped
[3:08:15.440 --> 3:08:18.440]  drinking all that sugar, and I just want to thank you for that, man.
[3:08:18.440 --> 3:08:23.040]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term, high-quality energy powder
[3:08:23.040 --> 3:08:24.040]  there is.
[3:08:24.040 --> 3:08:26.240]  So this was designed on one of the top guys in the country.
[3:08:26.240 --> 3:08:29.240]  He didn't want his name on it because obviously the political issues, but we had to pay a
[3:08:29.240 --> 3:08:31.440]  lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it.
[3:08:31.440 --> 3:08:35.940]  And we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there, and you're
[3:08:35.940 --> 3:08:37.440]  saying that it's made your life better.
[3:08:37.440 --> 3:08:38.440]  So that means a lot to me.
[3:08:38.440 --> 3:08:39.440]  Thank you to all your truck drivers.
[3:08:39.440 --> 3:08:42.440]  We love you.
[3:08:42.440 --> 3:08:51.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:08:51.440 --> 3:09:06.120]  Okay, we're back with our pre-revolutionary chat.
[3:09:06.120 --> 3:09:08.800]  What's the purpose of this battle of the monuments?
[3:09:08.800 --> 3:09:10.560]  Why is this happening?
[3:09:10.560 --> 3:09:15.480]  Not only in America, but across the United Kingdom and even in Europe.
[3:09:15.480 --> 3:09:17.560]  What's happening?
[3:09:17.560 --> 3:09:24.440]  This is a malice year zero where everything that comes before is demolished.
[3:09:24.440 --> 3:09:34.800]  In England, they've even vandalized a statue of Robert de Bruce, the braveheart figure
[3:09:34.800 --> 3:09:39.920]  who had never saw a black person in his life, probably didn't even know that Africa existed.
[3:09:39.920 --> 3:09:47.040]  So we're rapidly just getting into a thing about the white master having to come down,
[3:09:47.040 --> 3:09:50.720]  create, from any era on any country.
[3:09:50.720 --> 3:09:54.600]  And this is absolutely going to lead to a race war.
[3:09:54.600 --> 3:10:00.720]  And the people fomenting this, they are useful idiots, but many of them are just totally
[3:10:00.720 --> 3:10:01.720]  evil.
[3:10:01.720 --> 3:10:05.240]  They understand it, and they want it to happen.
[3:10:05.240 --> 3:10:08.840]  It's a saying ascribed to Lenin, the worse the better.
[3:10:08.840 --> 3:10:13.400]  The worse the conditions, the better it is for creating a revolution.
[3:10:13.400 --> 3:10:14.840]  The people have to be hungry.
[3:10:14.840 --> 3:10:20.840]  There have to be food riots before people will actually storm the governor's mansions
[3:10:20.840 --> 3:10:23.040]  and storm the political buildings.
[3:10:23.040 --> 3:10:27.800]  Not just a handful of Antifa, but the large scale of the population.
[3:10:27.800 --> 3:10:34.280]  Now in our country, less than 15% of people are black, so a race war just based on the
[3:10:34.280 --> 3:10:41.680]  numbers might not go so well for anybody who is stoking this racial hatred.
[3:10:41.680 --> 3:10:43.040]  But it doesn't matter.
[3:10:43.040 --> 3:10:47.760]  The outcome of this period of the strife is not what's key.
[3:10:47.760 --> 3:10:53.160]  It's just reducing America to anarchy and strife and civil war.
[3:10:53.160 --> 3:10:59.800]  If America is tearing itself apart, this will absolutely benefit most of all the Chinese
[3:10:59.800 --> 3:11:01.000]  communists.
[3:11:01.000 --> 3:11:07.320]  We will be unable to protect Taiwan or allies in the Philippines or Malaysia or other areas
[3:11:07.320 --> 3:11:09.520]  that may be of interest to China.
[3:11:09.520 --> 3:11:16.480]  While we are ripping our own throats out, like wild cats in a sack, China will have
[3:11:16.480 --> 3:11:19.240]  a free hand everywhere that it pleases.
[3:11:19.240 --> 3:11:26.240]  So the people that are stirring up this hatred, they don't care if it turns out that there's
[3:11:26.240 --> 3:11:32.760]  a right wing reaction and a brutal military dictatorship, or if it turns out to be a left
[3:11:32.760 --> 3:11:39.280]  wing Maoist revolution with a cultural revolution and gulags, that's not the point.
[3:11:39.280 --> 3:11:40.440]  They don't care.
[3:11:40.440 --> 3:11:43.200]  They want to see America wrecked.
[3:11:43.200 --> 3:11:48.560]  And when this ship of state is driven at full speed onto the reef, they don't really care
[3:11:48.560 --> 3:11:53.520]  if it gets stuck on the rocks or if it sinks in deep water or breaks up in five pieces.
[3:11:53.520 --> 3:11:57.280]  They just want to see America wrecked.
[3:11:57.280 --> 3:12:03.360]  And you've got, you know, outside of the people that are knowingly, willingly doing this,
[3:12:03.360 --> 3:12:09.360]  you have, as always, a much bigger cadre of useful idiots.
[3:12:09.360 --> 3:12:15.240]  Thanks to the Gramsian long walk through the institutions and the deliberate sabotage of
[3:12:15.240 --> 3:12:21.080]  our educational standards to crank out little communists, we now have, you know, untold
[3:12:21.080 --> 3:12:27.560]  millions of useful idiots willing to march in the street once they're sufficiently provoked
[3:12:27.560 --> 3:12:30.720]  and whipped up by our Marxist mainstream media.
[3:12:30.720 --> 3:12:37.240]  Now, at the macro level, we see this with people just sending money to Black Lives Matter,
[3:12:37.240 --> 3:12:42.000]  even though the money's going into private hands or to the Democrats.
[3:12:42.000 --> 3:12:48.640]  And at the smallest local level, you'll see thousands of people turn out for a march.
[3:12:48.640 --> 3:12:53.400]  And if you look at this graphic that's up right now, I made that today, you can see
[3:12:53.400 --> 3:12:59.360]  that the red in the center, these are the actual Antifa hardcore cadres.
[3:12:59.360 --> 3:13:01.540]  These are the trained operatives.
[3:13:01.540 --> 3:13:07.280]  These are the guys that are wearing black that have the ear thing that are using tactical
[3:13:07.280 --> 3:13:09.800]  radios and burner phones.
[3:13:09.800 --> 3:13:16.360]  These are guys that are employing very sophisticated cell structure with like little squads and
[3:13:16.360 --> 3:13:24.760]  captains and kernels that are driving around in vehicles with the radio cell phone jammers
[3:13:24.760 --> 3:13:27.040]  and other sophisticated equipment.
[3:13:27.040 --> 3:13:28.640]  This is actually happening.
[3:13:28.640 --> 3:13:33.840]  The guys that you see actually smashing the window with a skateboard, he's like a private,
[3:13:33.840 --> 3:13:38.760]  he's a foot soldier, but there's a chain of command all the way up to a person leading
[3:13:38.760 --> 3:13:39.760]  the entire riot.
[3:13:39.760 --> 3:13:45.640]  Now, you can see on this graphic, the green ring is the useful idiots.
[3:13:45.640 --> 3:13:51.840]  Right around the actual Antifa cadre, which might only be 20 to 40 people, you have support.
[3:13:51.840 --> 3:13:56.800]  They know that they're defending Antifa and they'll get in the way of police, they'll
[3:13:56.800 --> 3:13:58.440]  block cameras.
[3:13:58.440 --> 3:14:04.640]  They're not actually going to smash a window or throw a Molotov cocktail, but they know
[3:14:04.640 --> 3:14:06.600]  they're there to be human shields.
[3:14:06.600 --> 3:14:10.880]  The useful idiots are also human shields and they don't even know it.
[3:14:10.880 --> 3:14:19.720]  But when the police are so stretched that say 100 police have to mind a herd of 10,000
[3:14:19.720 --> 3:14:23.360]  marchers, it's impossible for them to contain it.
[3:14:23.360 --> 3:14:29.440]  So there are all these gaps where the Antifa hardcore can dash out through their useful
[3:14:29.440 --> 3:14:33.040]  idiot shield and smash windows.
[3:14:33.040 --> 3:14:34.840]  That's signal number one.
[3:14:34.840 --> 3:14:39.480]  When a window is smashed by that harmless skateboard, so we all by now know that the front wheels
[3:14:39.480 --> 3:14:44.960]  of a skateboard, when used like a bat or like a perfect window breaker on police cars or
[3:14:44.960 --> 3:14:47.040]  on storefront windows.
[3:14:47.040 --> 3:14:54.320]  So once the window is broken, then the useful idiots who are in a looting mode, they rush
[3:14:54.320 --> 3:14:55.320]  in.
[3:14:55.320 --> 3:14:57.480]  This diverts attention for the police.
[3:14:57.480 --> 3:14:58.800]  The police don't know what to do.
[3:14:58.800 --> 3:15:00.680]  They can't really make mass arrests.
[3:15:00.680 --> 3:15:02.840]  There's too many people at once.
[3:15:02.840 --> 3:15:08.000]  And these little probes can be striking out in multiple directions, as we've seen.
[3:15:08.000 --> 3:15:17.160]  Then once the looting phase is finished, the Antifa fire crew comes in and sets the store
[3:15:17.160 --> 3:15:18.400]  on fire.
[3:15:18.400 --> 3:15:20.480]  That's the progression.
[3:15:20.480 --> 3:15:23.440]  Broken windows, looting, fires.
[3:15:23.440 --> 3:15:29.780]  With often the flanks, other teams setting arson fires just as diversion attacks.
[3:15:29.780 --> 3:15:33.240]  This is not some random spontaneous behavior.
[3:15:33.240 --> 3:15:35.360]  These people are trained.
[3:15:35.360 --> 3:15:37.640]  These people have gone to camps.
[3:15:37.640 --> 3:15:42.200]  They have unbelievable amount of unity and discipline.
[3:15:42.200 --> 3:15:49.640]  Now they're all mostly beta males and SJW chicks, but that makes them no less dangerous
[3:15:49.640 --> 3:15:51.980]  because they will follow orders.
[3:15:51.980 --> 3:15:54.600]  They actually believe in something.
[3:15:54.600 --> 3:16:01.040]  You could say that in the 20th century and the 21st century, the most successful by far
[3:16:01.040 --> 3:16:09.240]  evangelizing religion, even more than Islam, is Marxism-Leninism, even when they camouflaged
[3:16:09.240 --> 3:16:10.240]  the title.
[3:16:10.240 --> 3:16:16.720]  I mean, how is it that we are cranking out millions from our best universities, millions
[3:16:16.720 --> 3:16:21.280]  of people whose goal is to destroy the country that nurtured them?
[3:16:21.280 --> 3:16:25.200]  I mean, this is an amazing, amazing time.
[3:16:25.200 --> 3:16:31.560]  And because college output is also the input for the military and for our intelligence
[3:16:31.560 --> 3:16:40.040]  services and even our FBI, now we see that we can't even trust our generals who are selected
[3:16:40.040 --> 3:16:43.480]  by the Senate from the colonels list.
[3:16:43.480 --> 3:16:45.360]  It's put forward to the Senate for a vote.
[3:16:45.360 --> 3:16:51.560]  So it becomes very political in our country when the generals that rise to the top are
[3:16:51.560 --> 3:16:58.480]  generally the deep state guys who are looking forward to double and triple dipping on a
[3:16:58.480 --> 3:17:02.720]  couple of corporate warbucks boards after they retire.
[3:17:02.720 --> 3:17:07.120]  They pay in advance while they're on active duty with a wink and a nod that after they
[3:17:07.120 --> 3:17:11.400]  get their 20 or their 25 years in, they're going to go to work for the country, for the
[3:17:11.400 --> 3:17:15.680]  company that they've been shoveling the contracts towards.
[3:17:15.680 --> 3:17:19.760]  It's incestuous even within our military.
[3:17:19.760 --> 3:17:24.440]  Not in the lower ranks, but the leadership of our military is not going to be there
[3:17:24.440 --> 3:17:25.920]  if they're needed.
[3:17:25.920 --> 3:17:27.360]  So what's going to happen next?
[3:17:27.360 --> 3:17:32.520]  Okay, between now and between now and the election, when we come back after this break,
[3:17:32.520 --> 3:17:36.360]  I'm going to talk about the steps that are going to happen next and how you can interpret
[3:17:36.360 --> 3:17:37.680]  them.
[3:17:37.680 --> 3:17:43.640]  We were told by the United Nations, we were told by the CDC and Fauci that two plus million
[3:17:43.640 --> 3:17:49.200]  Americans would die, that millions of Europeans would die, that we did not do exactly as they
[3:17:49.200 --> 3:17:50.200]  said.
[3:17:50.200 --> 3:17:55.040]  And it turned out it was all frauds, the models, the testing, taking regular depths and putting
[3:17:55.040 --> 3:17:58.800]  it in the COVID-19 column, all a complete criminal fraud.
[3:17:58.800 --> 3:18:02.760]  But none of them are getting sued, none of them are getting prosecuted, none of them are
[3:18:02.760 --> 3:18:06.760]  getting in trouble except for Bill Gates, the FDA, shut down his factories that are
[3:18:06.760 --> 3:18:10.640]  making fake COVID tests that show everyone is positive.
[3:18:10.640 --> 3:18:15.240]  And despite that, they're still testing record numbers of people, creating hysteria and saying
[3:18:15.240 --> 3:18:20.840]  the numbers, spiking and why it will be 200,000 dead by the election, and it's all Trump's
[3:18:20.840 --> 3:18:21.840]  fault.
[3:18:21.840 --> 3:18:26.000]  And now, oh, China had 40 cases in one city, we've got to lock down again, everything's
[3:18:26.000 --> 3:18:27.000]  over.
[3:18:27.000 --> 3:18:30.320]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the new order teaching us to be total prisoners.
[3:18:30.320 --> 3:18:38.600]  Either we expose the COVID hoax or all permanently enslaved by it, your choice.
[3:18:38.600 --> 3:18:48.080]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy and overall wellness.
[3:18:48.080 --> 3:18:55.840]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date, super male vitality, specifically
[3:18:55.840 --> 3:19:02.880]  designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality
[3:19:02.880 --> 3:19:03.880]  in males.
[3:19:03.880 --> 3:19:09.840]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses, and it contains
[3:19:09.840 --> 3:19:14.520]  no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[3:19:14.520 --> 3:19:15.520]  Yes.
[3:19:15.520 --> 3:19:22.080]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology, working together in
[3:19:22.080 --> 3:19:27.240]  perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[3:19:27.240 --> 3:19:28.680]  So what are you waiting for?
[3:19:28.680 --> 3:19:38.120]  Go to the N4 store, never been a better time than right now, super male vitality at n4store.com.
[3:19:38.120 --> 3:19:43.240]  It's finally here, introducing the first of its kind, nascent iodine spray with true atomic
[3:19:43.240 --> 3:19:44.240]  iodine.
[3:19:44.240 --> 3:19:48.440]  Listers have been asking us for months to develop an iodine spray made with our exclusive
[3:19:48.440 --> 3:19:50.640]  deep earth crystal nascent iodine.
[3:19:50.640 --> 3:19:52.600]  After extensive development, it's finally here.
[3:19:52.600 --> 3:19:57.240]  Our proprietary new aerodine technology allows us to harness the full power of ancient iodine
[3:19:57.240 --> 3:20:01.520]  crystals from 7,000 feet below the earth's surface into an ultimate spray formula.
[3:20:01.520 --> 3:20:05.720]  I have been using the new X2 spray every day, and I feel good knowing that I have the power
[3:20:05.720 --> 3:20:08.040]  of true nascent iodine working for my body.
[3:20:08.040 --> 3:20:09.760]  I can personally feel the difference.
[3:20:09.760 --> 3:20:14.160]  We know iodine is an essential mineral that supports thyroid health, as well as healthy
[3:20:14.160 --> 3:20:18.160]  metabolism, healthy hormone levels, and healthy cognitive function.
[3:20:18.160 --> 3:20:22.760]  Iodine may also support your body in healthy response to environmental and dietary toxins.
[3:20:22.760 --> 3:20:27.080]  Get your daily dose of essential iodine and experience the benefits of true nascent iodine
[3:20:27.080 --> 3:20:28.080]  today.

[3:20:40.360 --> 3:21:00.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:21:00.040 --> 3:21:06.360]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones with Matt Bracken.
[3:21:06.360 --> 3:21:23.440]  You know, to tell you the truth, if you want to see a couple of handbooks about what's
[3:21:23.440 --> 3:21:30.520]  going to happen next, I've been writing about this now for 15 years, and it's coming.
[3:21:30.520 --> 3:21:32.020]  It's happening.
[3:21:32.020 --> 3:21:37.680]  Another book that I highly recommend, I could be here all day recommending books, but you
[3:21:37.680 --> 3:21:41.560]  can get this on Amazon Used Marketplace for a couple of bucks.
[3:21:41.560 --> 3:21:48.720]  This is called The Dirty War by Martin Dillon, and it's about the battle between the Brits
[3:21:48.720 --> 3:21:53.440]  and the IRA from the 1960s through the 1990s.
[3:21:53.440 --> 3:21:57.880]  A lot of what's going to happen has already happened.
[3:21:57.880 --> 3:22:03.440]  The differences between the fight between the IRA and the Brits at the urban guerrilla
[3:22:03.440 --> 3:22:07.320]  warfare level, the differences are mainly technological.
[3:22:07.320 --> 3:22:13.760]  They didn't have cell phones, they didn't have the internet, we do, but those technological
[3:22:13.760 --> 3:22:21.760]  factors work for both sides, the sword and the shield, the enemies and the antagonists
[3:22:21.760 --> 3:22:27.240]  and protagonists, they all benefit from and suffer from the same technological advances.
[3:22:27.240 --> 3:22:31.680]  So they kind of cancel each other out like in a numerical equation.
[3:22:31.680 --> 3:22:40.760]  What's left to learn from that is the incredible amount of duplicity, the lying, the backstabbing,
[3:22:40.760 --> 3:22:48.160]  the double and triple of dealing with false agents, false informants.
[3:22:48.160 --> 3:22:53.280]  It's an unbelievable snake pit when you get into a dirty civil war.
[3:22:53.280 --> 3:22:58.960]  It's like trying to find the correct tail or head in a barrel full of rattlesnakes that
[3:22:58.960 --> 3:23:01.840]  are all squirming around together.
[3:23:01.840 --> 3:23:08.320]  People will lie, people will do false flag operations, governments will run dirty programs
[3:23:08.320 --> 3:23:11.120]  like I have in my novels.
[3:23:11.120 --> 3:23:17.040]  Governments will have secret units that they absolutely deny the existence of.
[3:23:17.040 --> 3:23:22.640]  They will swear there is no such thing as that unit, and that unit will be going out
[3:23:22.640 --> 3:23:27.680]  and snatching people and putting them into secret detention centers.
[3:23:27.680 --> 3:23:29.520]  Absolutely guaranteed.
[3:23:29.520 --> 3:23:33.040]  That's if they're even trying to be efficient and effective.
[3:23:33.040 --> 3:23:38.280]  Another dirty war that had a lot of similar manifestations and maybe even more apropos
[3:23:38.280 --> 3:23:44.680]  to what we're going to experience is the Argentina dirty war of the 1970s.
[3:23:44.680 --> 3:23:52.360]  With clandestine interrogation centers, assassinations of the families of military officers, that's
[3:23:52.360 --> 3:23:54.560]  what a dirty war is all about.
[3:23:54.560 --> 3:24:01.200]  It will make you yearn for the good old days of the North versus South Civil War when there
[3:24:01.200 --> 3:24:08.160]  was some level of chivalry where civilians were not intentionally targeted, where bombs
[3:24:08.160 --> 3:24:10.640]  weren't planted in churches.
[3:24:10.640 --> 3:24:17.720]  What's going to be coming is going to be very ugly, and a lot of the operations will
[3:24:17.720 --> 3:24:25.560]  be false flag operations, and the British war between, you could loosely say the British
[3:24:25.560 --> 3:24:32.560]  military and the SAS versus the official and provisional IRA and other groups.
[3:24:32.560 --> 3:24:38.560]  Both sides used a tremendous amount of false flag bombings.
[3:24:38.560 --> 3:24:43.560]  They planted bombs in their own territory to blame on their enemy.
[3:24:43.560 --> 3:24:46.160]  This is absolutely to be expected.
[3:24:46.160 --> 3:24:51.300]  When you see somebody sniped, always ask yourself, who benefits?
[3:24:51.300 --> 3:24:57.240]  If the result of a sniping or a bombing is that the media can fan up hatred against the
[3:24:57.240 --> 3:25:05.080]  conservatives, then you can bet it was probably a false flag operation committed by the leftists.
[3:25:05.080 --> 3:25:11.280]  As this progresses, there will be action and reaction from both sides, and it's almost
[3:25:11.280 --> 3:25:18.480]  just as likely when a sniping happens or a bomb goes off that it will be a false flag
[3:25:18.480 --> 3:25:20.560]  because they work.
[3:25:20.560 --> 3:25:26.320]  You will have public officials absolutely swearing that they know nothing about some
[3:25:26.320 --> 3:25:34.160]  special unit which is working with some secret militia or some secret left-wing militia like
[3:25:34.160 --> 3:25:36.540]  the John Brown Gun Club.
[3:25:36.540 --> 3:25:42.640]  I will absolutely swear there's no connection whatsoever between hypothetically Seattle
[3:25:42.640 --> 3:25:48.120]  Police Department Special Intelligence Unit and John Brown Gun Club.
[3:25:48.120 --> 3:25:53.480]  They absolutely, they don't even know who they are, but this is ridiculous.
[3:25:53.480 --> 3:25:59.200]  I would expect in this environment with so many of our law enforcement having come out
[3:25:59.200 --> 3:26:05.720]  of college as indoctrinated Marxists, I would expect that the FBI is not going to particularly
[3:26:05.720 --> 3:26:06.720]  be on our side.
[3:26:06.720 --> 3:26:13.600]  I don't know if you missed it, but last week in Washington, the FBI agents with their tactical
[3:26:13.600 --> 3:26:18.840]  gear on took a knee in support of the Black Lives Matter, which is a Marxist outfit.
[3:26:18.840 --> 3:26:22.160]  I mean, it was founded by Marxist revolutionaries.
[3:26:22.160 --> 3:26:23.840]  They make no bones about it.
[3:26:23.840 --> 3:26:29.120]  Their goal is to destroy the United States of America as a constitutional republic.
[3:26:29.120 --> 3:26:31.120]  That's their goal.
[3:26:31.120 --> 3:26:36.720]  And there are so many useful brainwashed idiots in this country that reflexively, because
[3:26:36.720 --> 3:26:41.400]  of what they see repeated on the media, they just say, oh, of course, I support Black Lives
[3:26:41.400 --> 3:26:42.400]  Matters.
[3:26:42.400 --> 3:26:47.800]  I mean, this is a classic example of a wolf in sheep's clothing, and it's effective.
[3:26:47.800 --> 3:26:57.000]  I mean, look at this FBI operation that you would imagine that if pallets of bricks had
[3:26:57.000 --> 3:27:04.120]  been dropped off on the same day in a dozen different cities on routes where marches were
[3:27:04.120 --> 3:27:08.120]  going to take place, even though they weren't scheduled, they weren't, you know, like written
[3:27:08.120 --> 3:27:14.440]  in anybody's diary, if pallets of bricks were dropped off in a dozen cities to be picked
[3:27:14.440 --> 3:27:20.960]  up by protest marchers, how hard would that be for the FBI to figure that out?
[3:27:20.960 --> 3:27:25.320]  You need a truck with a special lift or a little crane.
[3:27:25.320 --> 3:27:31.000]  You need, there's invoices, there's an electronic paper trail.
[3:27:31.000 --> 3:27:36.840]  These bricks aren't just falling out of the sky, yet somehow, the same FBI, which was
[3:27:36.840 --> 3:27:45.320]  led by Comey and Strzok and Page and traders like that, that same FBI at the lower level
[3:27:45.320 --> 3:27:50.680]  that Sean Hannity assures us every night that 99% of them are just the best, most patriotic
[3:27:50.680 --> 3:27:51.680]  Americans.
[3:27:51.680 --> 3:27:54.240]  Well, I've got news for you.
[3:27:54.240 --> 3:28:00.320]  If Page and Strzok and Comey graduated from the FBI Academy 15 or 20 years ago, you think
[3:28:00.320 --> 3:28:05.480]  that they're making more patriotic Americans that are coming out of college and going into
[3:28:05.480 --> 3:28:08.720]  the FBI or less patriotic.
[3:28:08.720 --> 3:28:15.480]  I mean, it churned my guts to see FBI agents taking a knee for Black Lives Matter with
[3:28:15.480 --> 3:28:19.200]  the FBI logo on their tactical vests.
[3:28:19.200 --> 3:28:24.920]  It disgusted me, and you're telling me that they can't crack the case of pallets of bricks
[3:28:24.920 --> 3:28:27.480]  all being delivered in a dozen cities.
[3:28:27.480 --> 3:28:31.320]  That is the essence of a federal crime.
[3:28:31.320 --> 3:28:35.320]  Or maybe some people will say, well, Matt, it takes a while to investigate these things.
[3:28:35.320 --> 3:28:40.440]  Look, when you're trying to put out a fire, you've got to move and make some decisive
[3:28:40.440 --> 3:28:41.440]  arrests.
[3:28:41.440 --> 3:28:44.000]  You've got to grab some of the leaders.
[3:28:44.000 --> 3:28:47.480]  Somebody made a decision to drop off all those bricks.
[3:28:47.480 --> 3:28:53.400]  There were conversations that I'm sure they can be found, and there are email contacts
[3:28:53.400 --> 3:28:54.400]  and conversations.
[3:28:54.400 --> 3:29:00.960]  And if the FBI doesn't arrest people for those bricks, then there is no FBI or they're working
[3:29:00.960 --> 3:29:03.040]  for the other side.
[3:29:03.040 --> 3:29:10.000]  And that is a key ingredient of a dirty war because you're going to have the totally selective
[3:29:10.000 --> 3:29:18.600]  use of law enforcement to punish your political allies and to punish your political enemies
[3:29:18.600 --> 3:29:25.280]  and punish your enemies.
[3:29:25.280 --> 3:29:26.960]  Sound like Joe Biden now.
[3:29:26.960 --> 3:29:32.480]  But listen, when you can't trust law enforcement or they've been so demoralized that they take
[3:29:32.480 --> 3:29:39.520]  themselves out of the picture, we're going to see a devolution and a total anarchy.
[3:29:39.520 --> 3:29:45.160]  If you heard about Atlanta last night with all the police on the blue flu sick out,
[3:29:45.160 --> 3:29:50.440]  how long will it take criminals to figure out that gun store or jewelry store?
[3:29:50.440 --> 3:29:53.320]  Nobody's going to come if I bust in there tonight.
[3:29:53.320 --> 3:29:54.580]  This is going to spread.
[3:29:54.580 --> 3:30:00.840]  This is why the FBI needs to make key arrests immediately as soon as possible because this
[3:30:00.840 --> 3:30:02.680]  is going to spread.
[3:30:02.680 --> 3:30:08.960]  And once the store owners realize there are no police, there's going to be a lot of dead
[3:30:08.960 --> 3:30:13.960]  bodies on sidewalks near broken windows and near statues.
[3:30:13.960 --> 3:30:16.080]  That's the next thing that's going to happen.
[3:30:16.080 --> 3:30:21.520]  Some Americans are going to say, well, I can't protect that Columbus statue by myself when
[3:30:21.520 --> 3:30:27.240]  a hundred Antifa come, but I can sure make it painful for them to be the guy climbing
[3:30:27.240 --> 3:30:29.720]  up on top with the cable.
[3:30:29.720 --> 3:30:31.040]  Real painful.
[3:30:31.040 --> 3:30:37.280]  And that's what the kind of thing we're going to see next.
[3:30:37.280 --> 3:30:45.840]  It's finally here, introducing the new survival shield X2 spray available now for 33% off
[3:30:45.840 --> 3:30:49.760]  at infowarstore.com.
[3:30:49.760 --> 3:30:56.200]  Listeners have been asking us for months to develop an iodine spray made with our exclusive
[3:30:56.200 --> 3:30:59.600]  deep earth crystal nascent iodine.
[3:30:59.600 --> 3:31:06.800]  Our proprietary new aerodyne technology allows us to harness the full power of ancient iodine
[3:31:06.800 --> 3:31:14.520]  crystals from 7,000 feet below the earth's surface into the ultimate spray formula.
[3:31:14.520 --> 3:31:20.520]  Iodine is an essential mineral that helps support thyroid health, healthy metabolism,
[3:31:20.520 --> 3:31:22.360]  and healthy cognitive function.
[3:31:22.360 --> 3:31:30.520]  Get the new survival shield X2 spray for 33% off intro pricing at infowarstore.com.
[3:31:30.520 --> 3:31:36.440]  That's survival shield X2 spray at infowarstore.com.
[3:31:36.440 --> 3:31:38.520]  The globalists want us domesticated.
[3:31:38.520 --> 3:31:44.880]  They want us inside our homes watching our television to be controlled by our quote smartphones.
[3:31:44.880 --> 3:31:45.880]  Everybody knows this.
[3:31:45.880 --> 3:31:46.880]  It's the admitted goal.
[3:31:46.880 --> 3:31:51.200]  We've had whistleblowers from Facebook, Twitter, and Google go public and say at the highest
[3:31:51.200 --> 3:31:56.720]  levels their job is to make you neurotic, destroy your mind, and take over your life.
[3:31:56.720 --> 3:31:59.280]  And now the COVID hysteria is all about that.
[3:31:59.280 --> 3:32:03.760]  I recently had a woman in the street walls with my youngest daughter and my daughter walked
[3:32:03.760 --> 3:32:10.120]  close to her and she said, get away six feet and gave her a super ugly look.
[3:32:10.120 --> 3:32:12.520]  This ladies and gentlemen is mental illness.
[3:32:12.520 --> 3:32:15.960]  My daughter walking four feet from some old woman is not a crime.
[3:32:15.960 --> 3:32:20.640]  The old woman's mental illness is the crime if we give in to it.
[3:32:20.640 --> 3:32:23.880]  This is total and complete mind control.
[3:32:23.880 --> 3:32:27.080]  We must expose the COVID hoax now.
[3:32:27.080 --> 3:32:29.160]  They're going to continue to clamp down using this.
[3:32:29.160 --> 3:32:30.960]  It's a UN Bill Gates plan.
[3:32:30.960 --> 3:32:34.480]  They've been proven to be criminal liars and they must be defeated.
[3:32:34.480 --> 3:32:38.320]  They must be exposed.
[3:32:38.320 --> 3:32:43.000]  What info wars has been able to do thanks to your support and your prayers and your word
[3:32:43.000 --> 3:32:48.240]  of mouth has been nothing short of historic and truly epic.
[3:32:48.240 --> 3:32:52.000]  This is the battle for the future of humanity.
[3:32:52.000 --> 3:32:59.360]  And now open world government is being established with an end game to depopulate the planet.
[3:32:59.360 --> 3:33:04.800]  Now the internal operations of the globalist are being externalized.
[3:33:04.800 --> 3:33:07.480]  You must decide which side you're on.
[3:33:07.480 --> 3:33:12.080]  Living in denial, having mass Stockholm syndrome, learned helplessness will only deliver you
[3:33:12.080 --> 3:33:15.480]  into misery, destruction, and finally death.
[3:33:15.480 --> 3:33:20.840]  And this is a spiritual death we're talking about, not just a physical death.
[3:33:20.840 --> 3:33:23.560]  The delusions must end now.
[3:33:23.560 --> 3:33:28.960]  Info wars was correct about it all and we have come so far by exposing the enemy.
[3:33:28.960 --> 3:33:32.040]  The people that are aware of the new will decide to join it out of fear.
[3:33:32.040 --> 3:33:37.360]  They are truly fearless, we must fight this or lose our souls.

[3:34:41.440 --> 3:34:59.640]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:34:59.640 --> 3:35:03.360]  Final segment and the wrap up.
[3:35:03.360 --> 3:35:10.920]  We left you off with my hypothesis that things are about to get sporty in a kinetic way.
[3:35:10.920 --> 3:35:17.680]  The Albuquerque shooting was just like a little hors d'oeuvre, an appetizer.
[3:35:17.680 --> 3:35:22.680]  There was also somebody I think in Portland ran over a couple protesters actually just
[3:35:22.680 --> 3:35:27.160]  refused to stop when they got in front of his car, which to me is a Darwin award.
[3:35:27.160 --> 3:35:33.920]  I mean, if you're on a public street as far as I'm concerned, even in Portlandia, Portlandistan,
[3:35:33.920 --> 3:35:36.960]  if you want to stop my car, you better be a police officer.
[3:35:36.960 --> 3:35:41.920]  If you're just some, you know, face pierced thug standing in front of my car, that's why
[3:35:41.920 --> 3:35:44.440]  I have a high clearance SUV.
[3:35:44.440 --> 3:35:46.000]  I'm not stopping.
[3:35:46.000 --> 3:35:52.040]  In the first days of Minneapolis, there was actually a tanker truck driver on I-35 where
[3:35:52.040 --> 3:35:56.560]  there were hundreds of people in front of him and he slowed down and got up a little
[3:35:56.560 --> 3:36:01.200]  speed and slowed down and I could only imagine what was going through his mind.
[3:36:01.200 --> 3:36:06.200]  If I stop, I might become Reginald Denny, brain damage with a cinder block.
[3:36:06.200 --> 3:36:11.600]  If I run over them, I'll be a mass murderer, but this is the kind of decision that's coming.
[3:36:11.600 --> 3:36:16.320]  And when you're out in traffic, you better be thinking of escape routes.
[3:36:16.320 --> 3:36:20.080]  Never stop without room to accelerate out.
[3:36:20.080 --> 3:36:22.680]  Never stop bumper to bumper in traffic.
[3:36:22.680 --> 3:36:23.680]  Just don't do it.
[3:36:23.680 --> 3:36:25.560]  You got any concerns at all.
[3:36:25.560 --> 3:36:30.400]  Leave that 12 or 15 feet so you can get up some speed and swerve out of danger because
[3:36:30.400 --> 3:36:32.000]  this is coming.
[3:36:32.000 --> 3:36:34.360]  So what's going to happen next?
[3:36:34.360 --> 3:36:41.680]  I can only speak about some small units, some small conservative paramilitary units that
[3:36:41.680 --> 3:36:48.600]  I have hypothetically heard about, but they're not in contact at any kind of a national level.
[3:36:48.600 --> 3:36:51.720]  There is no like antifa overall organization.
[3:36:51.720 --> 3:36:54.680]  It doesn't exist.
[3:36:54.680 --> 3:37:00.160]  Security is the primary factor to consider in any kind of a little trust group.
[3:37:00.160 --> 3:37:04.800]  And I'm talking a group of between two and 10 at the outside.
[3:37:04.800 --> 3:37:09.880]  These are people that have known each other for many years, like brothers.
[3:37:09.880 --> 3:37:14.320]  If anybody showed up and tried to join or hung around and said, Hey, I hear you and
[3:37:14.320 --> 3:37:16.360]  some guys that go out shooting.
[3:37:16.360 --> 3:37:19.720]  They would absolutely say, I have no idea what you're talking about.
[3:37:19.720 --> 3:37:27.640]  But any, any counteraction to antifa is going to take place at this small unit level where
[3:37:27.640 --> 3:37:35.160]  an operation will happen against, for example, somebody taking down a statue of Jefferson
[3:37:35.160 --> 3:37:37.440]  or Washington.
[3:37:37.440 --> 3:37:41.400]  Somebody is going to be plinked if I can put it that way.
[3:37:41.400 --> 3:37:47.440]  I'm just guessing hypothetically, but there are other operations that are also going to
[3:37:47.440 --> 3:37:54.040]  happen because of just studying the last month, the last couple of weeks.
[3:37:54.040 --> 3:37:57.040]  You can see that people have been followed home.
[3:37:57.040 --> 3:37:59.600]  People have been followed home from rallies.
[3:37:59.600 --> 3:38:05.320]  Conservatives by antifa, you know, undercover, the black guys in black are just their privates.
[3:38:05.320 --> 3:38:06.720]  They're meant to be seen.
[3:38:06.720 --> 3:38:12.000]  The guys who are not wearing the black, they may have something like this hidden with a
[3:38:12.000 --> 3:38:15.400]  hood over it, but they're not meant to be seen.
[3:38:15.400 --> 3:38:20.720]  And then you've got guys in vehicles that are run that are like flankers or recon elements.
[3:38:20.720 --> 3:38:25.920]  They also constitute a quick reaction force in case the conservatives did get a little
[3:38:25.920 --> 3:38:27.120]  too aggressive.
[3:38:27.120 --> 3:38:30.160]  They'll have people that can rush in in vehicles.
[3:38:30.160 --> 3:38:32.160]  This has already been displayed.
[3:38:32.160 --> 3:38:34.840]  Of course, you'll never see this in the mainstream media.
[3:38:34.840 --> 3:38:39.600]  You have to pick this up in, you know, alternate media.
[3:38:39.600 --> 3:38:42.680]  But there have been people followed home.
[3:38:42.680 --> 3:38:43.680]  Houses have been attacked.
[3:38:43.680 --> 3:38:45.520]  Cars have been attacked.
[3:38:45.520 --> 3:38:47.560]  People have had their homes vandalized.
[3:38:47.560 --> 3:38:51.320]  It's a small step from there to the Molotov cocktail.
[3:38:51.320 --> 3:38:58.080]  Now a note about Molotov cocktails historically up until really right now, like this year,
[3:38:58.080 --> 3:39:03.000]  the rule of engagement for somebody getting ready to throw a Molotov cocktail is that
[3:39:03.000 --> 3:39:06.440]  you can shoot them on site, on site.
[3:39:06.440 --> 3:39:12.160]  You don't have to wait to be set on fire or your house set on fire or your shop set on
[3:39:12.160 --> 3:39:13.160]  fire.
[3:39:13.160 --> 3:39:18.600]  If somebody is standing outside of your shop, your home or next to you on the street and
[3:39:18.600 --> 3:39:23.760]  they're lighting a Molotov, that constitutes a deadly threat right then period.
[3:39:23.760 --> 3:39:25.240]  Shoot them.
[3:39:25.240 --> 3:39:28.080]  That was always the law enforcement rule of engagement.
[3:39:28.080 --> 3:39:31.680]  And that's why arson attacks used to be rare.
[3:39:31.680 --> 3:39:38.040]  Now the police have been so hamstrung that somebody has to be caught with a car full
[3:39:38.040 --> 3:39:41.840]  of Molotov cocktails to even be booked.
[3:39:41.840 --> 3:39:47.640]  But the actual guy standing there on the sidewalk with it in his hand on film.
[3:39:47.640 --> 3:39:50.880]  That used to be a target of opportunity.
[3:39:50.880 --> 3:39:57.100]  And as the police are demoralized, not only defunded but demoralized to the point where
[3:39:57.100 --> 3:40:02.480]  all they do is get in their squad car, drive off to a shady spot behind the Dunkin Donuts
[3:40:02.480 --> 3:40:04.840]  and wait out their shift.
[3:40:04.840 --> 3:40:07.600]  These cops aren't going to be a factor.
[3:40:07.600 --> 3:40:12.120]  It's going to be the rooftop Koreans that are going to be a factor in terms of static
[3:40:12.120 --> 3:40:18.280]  defense but then expanding upon a static defense will be people that are anticipating
[3:40:18.280 --> 3:40:24.520]  Antifa moves and are setting up what you might call an overwatch position where they can
[3:40:24.520 --> 3:40:32.760]  either make a target of opportunity kinetically or with binoculars and with the technical
[3:40:32.760 --> 3:40:41.200]  radio means figure out who the bosses of these Antifa squads are and follow them home.
[3:40:41.200 --> 3:40:46.480]  Another type of operation will be what I would call a bait operation where you can predict
[3:40:46.480 --> 3:40:52.960]  that if you send somebody into or near the Antifa, they will be followed home.
[3:40:52.960 --> 3:40:57.440]  Like a woman who is waving an American flag, she got followed home or tires cut.
[3:40:57.440 --> 3:41:03.560]  Well, you can do a bait operation where you lure those Antifa followers right down an
[3:41:03.560 --> 3:41:12.760]  alley and as they used to say, give them what for extremely violently because if the police
[3:41:12.760 --> 3:41:18.240]  are going to step out of the equation, then that is part of the overall plan right now
[3:41:18.240 --> 3:41:25.040]  is to demoralize and get the police just to stand down.
[3:41:25.040 --> 3:41:28.400]  Conservatives aren't just going to watch their country taken over.
[3:41:28.400 --> 3:41:36.480]  There's a meme out there in a saying, genocides happen against an unarmed population.
[3:41:36.480 --> 3:41:42.960]  Civil wars happen when there's an armed population and there's never been a civil war in history
[3:41:42.960 --> 3:41:50.540]  that I'm aware of where millions upon millions of people were armed as well as law enforcement
[3:41:50.540 --> 3:41:56.920]  or the military at the small unit level with weapons that can reach out many hundreds of
[3:41:56.920 --> 3:41:59.240]  yards with great precision.
[3:41:59.240 --> 3:42:00.240]  It's never happened.
[3:42:00.240 --> 3:42:04.720]  You know, there's a saying about Switzerland, it's never been invaded by a foreign power.
[3:42:04.720 --> 3:42:10.720]  Well, it's also never had a tyrant rise to power because the Swiss have a culture of
[3:42:10.720 --> 3:42:17.560]  marksmanship and they take their battle weapons home after their brief military service.
[3:42:17.560 --> 3:42:25.520]  So with the Antifa and BLM that are trying to stoke this racial or class war, they may
[3:42:25.520 --> 3:42:29.160]  not really understand what they're getting in for.
[3:42:29.160 --> 3:42:31.440]  Absolutely the useful idiots have no idea.
[3:42:31.440 --> 3:42:39.520]  They'll believe whatever, you know, Don Lemon and Cuomo tell them on television, Rachel Maddow.
[3:42:39.520 --> 3:42:41.000]  They'll believe anything.
[3:42:41.000 --> 3:42:43.560]  The useful idiots will believe anything.
[3:42:43.560 --> 3:42:51.120]  But the Antifas that are larping as urban terrorists, they really don't have a clue because they're
[3:42:51.120 --> 3:42:58.600]  going up against hundreds of thousands of Americans that from Vietnam and the wars in
[3:42:58.600 --> 3:43:05.200]  the Middle East on have made a very close study of insurgency and counterinsurgency
[3:43:05.200 --> 3:43:13.040]  operations of operating in an urban guerrilla environment, have actually have like a PhD
[3:43:13.040 --> 3:43:14.040]  in it.
[3:43:14.040 --> 3:43:19.200]  Then they go back home and they run a machine shop or they become a lawyer, but they never
[3:43:19.200 --> 3:43:26.200]  forgot those skills and they're watching their country be figuratively shat upon and peed
[3:43:26.200 --> 3:43:34.000]  upon by these communist terrorists that our communist professors have been mass producing
[3:43:34.000 --> 3:43:36.080]  and they don't like it a bit.
[3:43:36.080 --> 3:43:38.800]  They really don't like it a bit.
[3:43:38.800 --> 3:43:45.760]  Now if you want to read more about where this can go, I would recommend my own long essay.
[3:43:45.760 --> 3:43:51.200]  It gets suppressed, websites disappear and they come back up, but right now, currently,
[3:43:51.200 --> 3:43:56.920]  you can read my essay called When the Music Stops, How America's Cities Will Explode
[3:43:56.920 --> 3:43:58.080]  in Violence.
[3:43:58.080 --> 3:44:03.240]  You can read it on American Partisan and if you want to see some of the tactics that
[3:44:03.240 --> 3:44:07.760]  I think are going to be coming into play, I dig pretty deep into them.
[3:44:07.760 --> 3:44:13.040]  This is the entire escalation, the scale of escalation on both sides, where it's going
[3:44:13.040 --> 3:44:14.160]  to take us.
[3:44:14.160 --> 3:44:19.520]  I think we're well into it and I don't see any way of turning this off because the Marxists
[3:44:19.520 --> 3:44:22.840]  see the November election as do or die.
[3:44:22.840 --> 3:44:28.440]  They will absolutely take nothing off the table in terms of tactics, nothing.
[3:44:28.440 --> 3:44:35.320]  So all the surprises we've seen in the first half of 2020, expect more surprises.
[3:44:35.320 --> 3:44:41.280]  Get your rifles zeroed, make sure you've got your preps laid in, harden your house because
[3:44:41.280 --> 3:44:43.800]  the Antifa are coming home.
[3:44:43.800 --> 3:44:47.760]  They're not just going to be at the statue, they're going to be going through their target
[3:44:47.760 --> 3:44:48.760]  list.
[3:44:48.760 --> 3:44:55.920]  There have already been reports about law enforcement officers' homes being reconned.
[3:44:55.920 --> 3:45:02.200]  These are all preliminary steps and before I go, I'd like to mention my novels that
[3:45:02.200 --> 3:45:05.000]  are all about this are available.
[3:45:05.000 --> 3:45:09.440]  You have to go to Amazon if you want to get Kindle or Audible, but if you want to get
[3:45:09.440 --> 3:45:16.520]  the printed hard copy book that can never be deleted by the NSA or Jeff Bezos, you can
[3:45:16.520 --> 3:45:20.280]  get them straight for me and the information is on my website.
[3:45:20.280 --> 3:45:40.120]  We are going into a terrible time, America, and we'll see how it turns out.
