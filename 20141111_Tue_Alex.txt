[00:00.000 --> 00:14.120]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.120 --> 00:39.360]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones well we had him on Sunday and he
[00:39.360 --> 00:43.800]  was basically starting to tell all about the real power struggles going on between different
[00:43.800 --> 00:48.960]  agencies in the federal government so dr. Steve Pachanick is going to be on with us in the
[00:48.960 --> 00:54.600]  third hour we'll have open phones for the last 30 minutes so you can ask Steve Pachanick your
[00:54.600 --> 01:03.680]  own questions so that's coming up today we also have Edward T. Haslamon who wrote Dr. Mary's
[01:03.680 --> 01:08.480]  monkey how the unsolved murder of a doctor a secret laboratory in New Orleans and cancer
[01:08.480 --> 01:13.880]  causing monkey viruses are linked to Lee Harvey Oswald the JFK assassination and emerging global
[01:13.880 --> 01:19.920]  pandemics for by Jim Mars we sell this book at enforce store.com but that's a side issue the
[01:19.920 --> 01:26.440]  reason it's important as it gets into how they manufacture a lot of these pandemics and a lot
[01:26.440 --> 01:31.840]  of times the cure is worse than the disease so it's been 30 minutes with the author of
[01:31.840 --> 01:38.960]  Dr. Mary's monkey excellent book getting into the weaponization of cancer more than just focusing
[01:38.960 --> 01:45.600]  in on Ebola and the laboratories developing that getting a different perspective we had of
[01:45.600 --> 01:50.960]  course the gentleman Stephen Hatfield the doctor who was accused of anthrax on the top
[01:50.960 --> 01:55.560]  bioweapons expert to get into Ebola people said no we some people said we don't agree with the
[01:55.560 --> 02:00.600]  stuff he said in his views well we bring you different perspectives this is not a cult and
[02:00.600 --> 02:07.080]  then I tell you what I think is going on as best I can tell and you can make up your own mind kind
[02:07.080 --> 02:13.320]  of like Fox News always said we report you decide the Democrats said you know they distort you
[02:13.320 --> 02:22.600]  decide but as far as I'm concerned all those big media outlets have a globalist agenda I have an
[02:22.600 --> 02:25.920]  agenda of trying to tell the truth trying to be accurate trying to build a better world for my
[02:25.920 --> 02:29.480]  children and a better world for your children because they're gonna live together into the
[02:29.480 --> 02:37.400]  future we're all on this ship together we'll open the phones up in the first hour today as well
[02:38.040 --> 02:44.040]  Ferguson is really heating up they could say that the verdict of the grand jury on whether to
[02:44.040 --> 02:50.120]  indict the police officer or not is going to be coming out in a matter of three four days it
[02:50.120 --> 02:56.920]  could be any minute they are bracing for it I think the longer they wait the worse they make it
[02:56.920 --> 03:03.720]  because it's just building and the media is now covering it throwing gas on the fire you can't
[03:03.720 --> 03:10.000]  really blame them though it is a news issue because what we've seen with Obama and MSNBC is a pure
[03:10.000 --> 03:16.680]  racial division agenda taking everybody fighting with each other and the legitimate the attempted
[03:16.680 --> 03:23.440]  legitimize things like the knockout game and what I'd call black-on-white black clan type
[03:23.440 --> 03:31.480]  activity humans are just humans humans have the same types in all quote groups and they act the
[03:31.480 --> 03:38.680]  same and and it was kosher for the clan in the south in some areas to attack black people and so
[03:38.680 --> 03:46.440]  they did it and now it's kosher to take any wrong towards a black person in some areas and
[03:46.440 --> 03:54.120]  project it onto whites in general and there obviously are a lot of police abuses as well so
[03:54.120 --> 03:58.600]  that throws gas on the fire there's a lot of mistrust of the government in general and that
[03:58.600 --> 04:05.080]  rolls downhill on the police departments the globalists do want to divide and conquer they do
[04:05.080 --> 04:10.280]  want to fight with the cops up they do want an us against them mentality the last thing they want
[04:10.280 --> 04:16.280]  us to do is to take control of our local police departments and reach out to them that will break
[04:16.280 --> 04:21.320]  the globalist takeover through the feds and that's why I've really attempted to hold up good police
[04:21.320 --> 04:28.480]  in the last five six years instead of just knee jerk reaction attack the police constantly because
[04:28.480 --> 04:36.600]  that's what the globalist want and we have to not have the civil war and Ferguson I just got
[04:36.600 --> 04:42.680]  chills every time I talk about it because it's we're on the verge of civil war homeland security has
[04:42.680 --> 04:49.640]  set it all up they've stirred it all up and are we dumb enough to kill each other get me the from
[04:49.640 --> 04:53.960]  russia would love clip please about the fighting fish time he's fighting fish we're gonna talk

[08:28.040 --> 08:40.040]  so
[08:43.720 --> 08:52.040]  sami's fighting fish fascinating creatures brave but dumb the whole stupid yes they're stupid
[08:52.040 --> 08:57.880]  except for the occasional one such as we have here let's the other two fight
[09:00.520 --> 09:01.400]  and he waits
[09:06.920 --> 09:13.880]  waits until the survivor is so exhausted that he cannot defend himself and then like specter
[09:13.880 --> 09:22.680]  he strikes i find the parallel amusing our organization did not arrange for you to come
[09:22.680 --> 09:32.520]  over from the russians just for amusement number three come in cronstein sit down number three
[09:32.520 --> 09:38.200]  while we listen to what number five is devised for us i hope cronstein's efforts as director of
[09:38.200 --> 09:44.840]  planning will continue to be as successful as his chess they will be according to your instructions
[09:44.840 --> 09:50.920]  i've planned for specter to steal from the russians their new lector decoding machine for this we need
[09:50.920 --> 09:56.920]  the services of a female member of the russian cryptograph section in turkey and the help of
[09:56.920 --> 10:02.040]  the british secret service naturally neither the russians nor the british will be aware that they
[10:02.040 --> 10:08.120]  are now working for us number three is your section ready to carry out cronstein's directives yes number
[10:08.120 --> 10:13.160]  one the operation will be organized according to cronstein's plan i have selected a suitable
[10:13.160 --> 10:19.080]  girl from the russian consulate in istanbul she's capable cooperative and her loyalty to the state
[10:19.080 --> 10:24.120]  is beyond question and you're absolutely sure she believes you're still head of operations for
[10:24.120 --> 10:29.880]  soviet intelligence it is most unlikely she will know i'm now working for specter mosca has kept my
[10:29.880 --> 10:36.520]  defection secret from everyone but a few members of the procedure for your sake i hope so cronstein
[10:36.520 --> 10:43.800]  you are sure this plan is foolproof yes it is because i have anticipated every possible variation of
[10:44.360 --> 10:49.720]  counter move but what makes you think that m the head of british intelligence will oblige you by
[10:49.720 --> 10:55.640]  falling in with your plan for the simple reason that this is so obviously a trap my reading of the
[10:55.640 --> 11:00.920]  british mentality is that they always treat a trap as a challenge in any case they couldn't possibly
[11:00.920 --> 11:07.000]  pass up even the slightest chance of getting their hands on the lectern decoder they have wanted one
[11:07.000 --> 11:13.560]  for years all that you say could be true what else as an added refinement i think that specter will
[11:13.560 --> 11:19.080]  probably have the chance of a person revenge for the killing of our operative doctor no because
[11:19.080 --> 11:24.600]  the men the british will almost certainly use on a mission of this thought would be their agent
[11:24.600 --> 11:32.520]  james bond let his death be a particularly unpleasant and humiliating one good i should
[11:32.520 --> 11:39.560]  put my plan into operation straight away and there will be no failure i have probably played
[11:39.560 --> 11:45.480]  that clip 20 times over the years because it's divide and conquer
[11:47.480 --> 11:52.840]  chicare jackson made a little piece detailing it comparing it to the fictitious character
[11:52.840 --> 12:00.760]  cobra commander but when you understand that high level os s and then mi6
[12:02.200 --> 12:07.960]  fleming ian fleming wrote the james bond books that then became the movie
[12:10.280 --> 12:16.920]  the films then you understand how shocking it all is because they're basically telling you
[12:16.920 --> 12:24.680]  what's really going on of course i wouldn't call it specter i would call it the carlal group
[12:27.240 --> 12:37.000]  i wouldn't call it chaos to use the get smart comedy i would call it the belterberg group
[12:40.360 --> 12:46.200]  when you look at the trilateral commission the cfr the un it's only a few hundred people
[12:46.200 --> 12:51.400]  that share and head up all these organizations and then they interface with the corporate hedge
[12:52.040 --> 13:03.160]  who have a moon raker plan we're living in their master plan we know a lot of their plan because
[13:03.160 --> 13:09.560]  much of its public what they wrote about the 30s 40s 50s 60s 70s 80s that's been declassified
[13:10.120 --> 13:14.760]  we can now see was actually carried out and you can follow their previous long term
[13:14.760 --> 13:24.280]  term engineering project and see where it's going the secret space programs the
[13:25.640 --> 13:31.320]  other secret programs that are going on are so advanced the elite now behave as if we don't
[13:31.320 --> 13:36.440]  even exist and the public decisions have been made and have been publicly announced
[13:37.000 --> 13:42.760]  in scores of publications that the cleanup world government is being established the
[13:42.760 --> 13:48.920]  robots and computers and smart grids are now being put in place the tentacles are being
[13:48.920 --> 13:58.280]  sent out to tie into every system and the great war against humanity is now being launched
[13:58.280 --> 14:03.560]  but incrementally in third world areas where communications aren't good and where people
[14:03.560 --> 14:09.480]  can't get word out or get help and then we will sit back afar accepting the technocracy
[14:09.480 --> 14:16.120]  as a cocoon of protection as we're under these great black wings of the carrion beast
[14:18.680 --> 14:24.360]  and it'll be phased in incrementally into the planopolis the social engineering
[14:26.280 --> 14:31.320]  viruses are already being released from the vaccine nanotech engineered systems they call
[14:31.320 --> 14:36.920]  viruses to reduce fertility as if we are living in children of men the film
[14:36.920 --> 14:47.080]  until only artificial babies will be capable of being produced that's being phased in now
[14:48.600 --> 14:54.120]  but humans are an incredibly resilient species and we'll have our own mutations against what's
[14:54.120 --> 15:02.920]  being done to us the system knows that and there will be a cultural societal genetic race memory
[15:02.920 --> 15:12.120]  through all of the derivations of homo sapiens sapien and hybrid homo sapiens sapiens and there
[15:12.120 --> 15:19.160]  will be a conscious response a subconscious response a mass subconscious response that the
[15:19.160 --> 15:24.280]  establishment's fully aware of and trying to gauge and control and placate through movies
[15:24.280 --> 15:30.680]  and culture that are giving us simulated race consciousness victories while on the physical
[15:30.680 --> 15:39.480]  plane we are being destroyed and that's why you're seeing so many hollywood films come out
[15:39.480 --> 15:45.160]  basically telling the truth decrying the police state decrying the technocracy decrying those
[15:45.160 --> 15:51.640]  that don't want us to get off the planet decrying the eugenicist is because it's a revelation of
[15:51.640 --> 15:59.320]  the method and even the producers and writers of those films don't understand this until they're
[15:59.320 --> 16:07.400]  told it by people like me and then their mouths hang up and and they say that's why they wouldn't
[16:07.400 --> 16:12.840]  let us do this in the past but now it's not just about the money because freedom is popular
[16:13.640 --> 16:18.520]  that's why we were approached by the cia that's why we were approached by mit that's why we were
[16:18.520 --> 16:23.080]  approached by the ford foundation or carning endowment for peace that's why they made recommendations
[16:23.080 --> 16:28.680]  of changes because they're just giving you a revelation of the method of what they're doing
[16:28.680 --> 16:35.080]  so your subconscious mind is prepared and comfortable with the death of the species
[16:36.760 --> 16:45.720]  and out of that mutagenic abomination they believe will rise the mutated human species to merge
[16:45.720 --> 16:51.480]  with the computers to merge with the silicon life form and the new species will be born
[16:51.480 --> 16:57.240]  and it might as well as be as alien as something from a trillion light years away coming through a
[16:57.240 --> 17:04.280]  wormhole but it won't come from a wormhole and it won't come from the horsehead nebula it will
[17:04.280 --> 17:11.080]  come from this planetoid orbiting that standard sign remember that when you sit here and think
[17:11.080 --> 17:20.680]  this is whacked out stuff you are on a planetoid orbiting a sun an asteroid belt and mars lay out
[17:20.680 --> 17:28.680]  towards the gas giants and the kuiper belt and the great long march of our species the nomads
[17:30.200 --> 17:36.600]  and our love of inventiveness and of working together against impossible odds and against
[17:36.600 --> 17:42.920]  creatures far more powerful than us we have conquered the planet and we're sold that that's
[17:42.920 --> 17:47.880]  an evil idea and a bad thing because they don't want you to admire yourself they don't want you
[17:47.880 --> 17:55.400]  to have that dignity of where you come from as a species that's why the most low of us still is an
[17:55.400 --> 18:01.880]  amazing creature but they've been turned into golem like creatures scrabbling after the
[18:01.880 --> 18:08.680]  signals and symbols of success the logos of power not the true power that already beats in your
[18:08.680 --> 18:20.040]  breast as the blue blood pours through your veins and arteries and no i'm not saying we're all blue
[18:20.040 --> 18:27.800]  bloods your blood is blue it's blue in your veins and red in your arteries when it spills out on the
[18:27.800 --> 18:38.040]  ground it's black and it's destined to colonize the universe and these evil priests of the
[18:38.040 --> 18:43.480]  Illuminati sitting there as the preachers up in their pulpits up in their satanic command bases
[18:44.040 --> 18:49.320]  tell you you're destined to fall you're destined to fail you're destined to die you're destined
[18:49.320 --> 18:55.160]  to roll over you're destined to submit and that when you act like a lowly coward rolling around

[19:00.280 --> 19:06.040]  say you defend your family of a killer came in your house christ wouldn't do that you should lay
[19:06.040 --> 19:10.760]  down when an intruder comes and pee on them those are the comments on youtube that's what the feds
[19:10.760 --> 19:16.680]  advise of course christ said sell your garment by a sword christ beat the money changers with a whip
[19:19.320 --> 19:24.680]  all the other prophets you name it didn't didn't didn't go along with what they were ordered to do
[19:24.680 --> 19:35.320]  do they stood john the baptist all of them christ gave himself up as a sacrifice
[19:36.440 --> 19:46.040]  to be abused and to be tortured as an example to be the phoenix rising from the ashes christ
[19:46.040 --> 19:51.800]  was there to take the fall and rise again christ was there to be martyred that's why

[24:30.280 --> 24:35.080]  fema reason six is veterans day
[24:37.480 --> 24:40.920]  and i wonder in all these parades and events they're going to be having i think are great
[24:40.920 --> 24:46.040]  are they going to talk about the death panels and the secret death list and all the major
[24:46.040 --> 24:52.280]  vas are they going to talk about how they're trying to take veterans of nonviolent records
[24:52.280 --> 24:57.880]  have done nothing wrong take their guns because in the homeland security reports they say the
[24:57.880 --> 25:03.000]  veterans are the new terrorist there was another report out yesterday with a police chief saying
[25:03.000 --> 25:09.960]  they need the m wraps to fight returning veterans the armored vehicles and they just keep saying
[25:09.960 --> 25:15.400]  veterans will ied improvise explosive device your department that's in federal documents
[25:15.400 --> 25:19.240]  been in the news for five six years that they tell them you're training to fight veterans
[25:19.240 --> 25:25.000]  they're going to bomb you you know cops let me just say something because i know you're not stupid
[25:26.280 --> 25:30.120]  when it comes to criminal stuff on average probably no more about the public i'll say that
[25:30.680 --> 25:34.920]  you know they're trying to hire dumb detectives and people now because criminals run the government
[25:34.920 --> 25:41.640]  don't want to be found out that's on record as well if there's no crime going on if somebody
[25:41.640 --> 25:45.240]  keeps saying that house is going to get burned down that house is going to get burned down and
[25:45.240 --> 25:50.920]  files a bunch of reports in a year and there's no evidence and no suspect and then the house burns
[25:50.920 --> 25:57.160]  down who do you go talk to you go talk to the person that keeps saying somebody's going to burn
[25:57.160 --> 26:00.520]  that church down or somebody's going to burn that down or somebody's going to throw them all off
[26:00.520 --> 26:06.120]  cocktails the governor's mansion you go to that person because obviously they're the prime suspect
[26:06.120 --> 26:14.280]  and nine times out of ten is going to be in them inside job so they just keep saying in fact that's
[26:14.280 --> 26:17.640]  that's scrolled off that's in featured news archive will you print me that the headlines
[26:17.640 --> 26:23.240]  like top cop says m rapture firm are for the tea party and then he gets into veterans in the article
[26:25.080 --> 26:30.280]  and the pentagon trains for that the tea party's not doing anything has the lowest crime rate and
[26:30.280 --> 26:36.120]  all the statistics out there conservatives libertarians christians everybody knows that it's in
[26:36.120 --> 26:40.760]  the criminology reports so why is that the main threat because you're not criminals that's that's
[26:40.760 --> 26:46.200]  why because the government's planning stuff so evil so over the top so criminal the illegitimate
[26:46.200 --> 26:50.840]  government that it wants to get the cops ready and tell you that's the enemy well you're not stupid
[26:50.840 --> 26:55.240]  police don't you have a lot more in common with the vets most of you are vets than you do with
[26:55.240 --> 27:00.760]  the scumbag politicians that have run this country on the ground intentionally so that's
[27:00.760 --> 27:05.240]  what i think about on veterans day i think about on veterans day the fact that what they're doing
[27:05.240 --> 27:10.040]  in obama care and and the rationing and the death list and and the death panels all the things that
[27:10.040 --> 27:16.520]  have now been admitted has been tested out at least the last six years seven years it did get
[27:16.520 --> 27:20.760]  worse under obama you just can't deny it they started putting the veterans by the tens of thousands
[27:20.760 --> 27:27.320]  a year on a no treatment list now it's the law to treat them the money's been paid to treat them
[27:27.320 --> 27:31.080]  it's not that you don't have the money to treat them you just give them pills and it's a death
[27:31.080 --> 27:36.600]  panel it's a bioethics committee you hear him saying don't you know kill kids up to age five
[27:36.600 --> 27:41.880]  kill old people this is what's going on this is being sold that hey you're of no use we're
[27:41.880 --> 27:47.640]  going to kill you hey grandmas of no use throw it on a well this is such a barbarous society
[27:47.640 --> 27:53.480]  you've had va supervisors on record but before all this broke saying older veterans should be
[27:53.480 --> 27:59.800]  shot in the head to save money we reported that before the veterans scandal broke that's their
[27:59.800 --> 28:07.560]  attitude towards them we have major whistleblowers on that whistleblower is in the top five people
[28:07.560 --> 28:14.600]  in the hospital in the huge medical facility they're happy to say they're a director we got
[28:14.600 --> 28:20.040]  all their credentials but we didn't use their name major east cusp facility one of the biggest
[28:20.040 --> 28:26.040]  in the country and the attitude is we hate the veterans by the administrators the rank and
[28:26.040 --> 28:32.600]  file are trying to help on average it's the same in every organization it's the same story so
[28:32.600 --> 28:38.360]  that's what i'm talking about on veterans day and we come back i'm going to obama over in asia and
[28:38.360 --> 28:45.240]  i'm going to get into the population vaccine in kenya mainstream news sterilizing a sterilizing

[33:29.640 --> 33:34.120]  well i said it yesterday and i'm very careful about my words and i'll say it again
[33:34.120 --> 33:43.400]  when you are hired by the winehouse to be part of an advisor to come up with a strategy on rolling
[33:43.400 --> 33:53.960]  out obama care that has the eugenics bioethics rationing of care death panels in them that is
[33:53.960 --> 33:59.400]  written by foreign insurance companies to double and then triple and then quadruple over five years
[33:59.400 --> 34:04.520]  the average premium of healthy people that have been insured for decades like my dad and my mother
[34:05.320 --> 34:10.920]  we've already seen a doubling now and myself it's gone up almost double for my family
[34:12.040 --> 34:18.040]  and you say we package it this way so that congress wouldn't know it was a tax so we could roll it
[34:18.040 --> 34:25.560]  through and transparency was key in getting it over on the dumb voters and the other professors
[34:25.560 --> 34:34.200]  are nodding that is a criminal conspiracy and that is a confession i don't know of a grand jury out
[34:34.200 --> 34:41.320]  there that wouldn't say that it wasn't fraud to write reports and to go out and be a pundit
[34:43.480 --> 34:47.400]  remember it was like seven eight years ago as a washington post headline
[34:47.400 --> 34:58.040]  g a o general accounting office rules that fake news is illegal in fact you can probably type in
[34:58.040 --> 35:03.800]  g a o rules fake news is illegal and it reported on tens of billions spent by the federal government
[35:06.200 --> 35:10.840]  directed by the white house but congress was involved to buy off
[35:10.840 --> 35:18.840]  the media behind the scenes to pay money to fox news cnn
[35:21.800 --> 35:25.880]  armstrong williams was the one guy they always pick one guy when a big corrupt story comes out
[35:25.880 --> 35:31.080]  oh he got 200 and or $340,000 to go around on a syndicated radio show and he's been on the
[35:31.080 --> 35:36.200]  show before he's a pretty good guy but he took that money to go and promote head start and say it
[35:36.200 --> 35:41.240]  was conservative to federalize education it's through head start that michelle obama gets to
[35:41.240 --> 35:48.600]  tell your kids what to eat yeah there it is washington post administration rejects ruling on pr videos
[35:48.600 --> 35:56.840]  g a o called tapes illegal propaganda man my memory is good 2005 i said six seven years ago
[35:56.840 --> 36:03.800]  though my memory wasn't good on that okay so time flies i look up it's like 2014 about
[36:03.800 --> 36:06.520]  2015 i can't even believe it now
[36:09.720 --> 36:17.560]  so when i say this is illegal i'm ready to be sued and knock on wood i haven't been for defamation
[36:17.560 --> 36:22.600]  or slander or libel i had a few threats and i said okay here's my lawyers here's our defense
[36:22.600 --> 36:27.320]  they stick their tail between their legs because i'm ready to go to court with this guy i'm ready
[36:27.320 --> 36:33.080]  to go to court with obama i'm ready to have them throw me in that briar patch any day i know
[36:33.080 --> 36:37.720]  criminal activity when i see it and when they sit up there on television
[36:39.800 --> 36:41.000]  and in print media
[36:43.400 --> 36:52.520]  and say we lied to people and they're dumb it's like zuckerberg saying our users trust us their
[36:52.520 --> 36:59.960]  dumb efforts these people have made you billions of dollars zuckerberg you sold them a pump and dump
[36:59.960 --> 37:08.120]  on your facebook stock you you censor people you manipulate you claim you're free and open
[37:08.120 --> 37:12.920]  you're not you're a fraud but you know what it's your company and you can have it in the terms
[37:12.920 --> 37:18.600]  and conditions in lawyer speaking cheat people and and sell their data and use it but it's not
[37:18.600 --> 37:23.000]  illegal he admits to calling them dumb efforts
[37:23.000 --> 37:31.560]  but when you work in the government and you take money to be in a commission and then you lie and
[37:31.560 --> 37:38.840]  deceive is that not fraud is fraud not illegal i want this professor prosecuted
[37:40.920 --> 37:45.160]  and i'm going to make some phone calls and talk to some criminal lawyers i know and others
[37:46.120 --> 37:51.160]  and make sure i get all the proper terms straight but i mean just under the propaganda
[37:51.160 --> 37:56.600]  function to be paid to go out and deceive is illegal gao ruling and there's a bunch of other
[37:56.600 --> 38:02.760]  federal and state rulings not just a bureaucratic ruling but everyone on their face knows
[38:03.960 --> 38:10.520]  that coming out saying we lied to people to pass something that takes money from them that's theft
[38:11.960 --> 38:16.920]  now maybe this guy isn't consciously a racketeer because when you work with a bunch of other people
[38:16.920 --> 38:23.720]  for fraud it's organized it's racketeering it's a racketeering practice maybe he doesn't know
[38:23.720 --> 38:30.200]  up in his little pinhead ivory tower as an economist what he's doing maybe there's an ignorance plea
[38:30.760 --> 38:35.880]  but it's kind of like with murder okay so it's manslaughter mac you didn't know when you punched
[38:35.880 --> 38:39.560]  him in the face he'd fall over and hit his head on the curb doesn't matter you're still liable
[38:39.560 --> 38:47.880]  these people need to be punished he wants to parade around up there on television it was originally
[38:47.880 --> 38:54.920]  on the university network system and then reared on c-span according to reports i have
[38:54.920 --> 38:59.960]  and then they want to run around and threaten fox news to not air it sing we don't give you
[38:59.960 --> 39:07.560]  permission hey you're a bunch of lawyers over there jerks we can't take an entire university
[39:07.560 --> 39:12.680]  transmission and try to sell dvds of it as if anybody will want to buy that but we can take
[39:12.680 --> 39:17.560]  the clip and put it in a film if we want as part of the context and sell it not that we want to do
[39:17.560 --> 39:25.880]  that and we can sure play it on radio and tv to show what you said in a public forum on television
[39:25.880 --> 39:33.000]  about screwing us there's a public interest and the public paid for the university i would love
[39:33.000 --> 39:40.360]  that lawsuit the court would cite you double the attorney's fees and time and damages i know
[39:41.080 --> 39:45.960]  the university's been threatened to sue people now who play the clip good sue me i'm not a
[39:45.960 --> 39:52.680]  litigious person but i will slap you down i can't believe how stupid all these lawyers are
[39:52.680 --> 39:57.320]  or maybe they're not stupid maybe they think i'm dumb like what you call the public i'm not dumb
[39:57.320 --> 40:03.800]  i'm not dumb i could be more corrupt and evil and all you combine but i refuse to screw people
[40:04.360 --> 40:08.280]  i refuse to sell out my honor so i know all your tricks you little rat
[40:12.280 --> 40:16.040]  this is what internet two is about where corporations or universities they get a lot
[40:16.040 --> 40:23.640]  of power in this they can shut down administratively your website or your content just by claiming
[40:23.640 --> 40:29.880]  anything or if you do it three times no judge no jury no no adjudification nothing they will
[40:29.880 --> 40:34.760]  just ban you off the internet forever and that's why obama announced the end of passcodes
[40:37.960 --> 40:43.480]  that's why obama came out and said i'm directing that you use biometrics because then they can
[40:43.480 --> 40:47.320]  have you biometrically tied to the internet you won't be able to use your smartphone you
[40:47.320 --> 40:52.200]  won't be able to use the internet computers if they banned you from the web an internet blacklist
[40:52.200 --> 40:57.720]  is what china is now going to biometrically working with microsoft this is their dashardly plan

[41:16.040 --> 41:22.280]  racketeering fraud it's racketeering when globally they get together with the car manufacturers and
[41:22.280 --> 41:26.840]  governments get these big trade agreements summits they have outside of law that now supersede our
[41:26.840 --> 41:38.920]  law according to their claims and say by the year 2020 by the year 2008 you look this up
[41:38.920 --> 41:49.160]  twice stumble i'm going to memory by the year 2008 all cars globally must have
[41:51.400 --> 41:56.840]  the box the tracks everywhere you go what you do a record of service everything and now they're
[41:56.840 --> 42:01.080]  adding gps to it in most cars and then they announced we're going to tax you by the mile
[42:01.640 --> 42:08.200]  that is an organized system outside of law outside of regulation outside of state or federal law
[42:08.200 --> 42:15.800]  being done by these people there's us today black boxes for cars raise privacy concerns
[42:15.800 --> 42:22.280]  magically they're globally standardized magically they started taxing people in a trial program in
[42:22.280 --> 42:32.440]  new york new york austin texas and san fran cisco it's always the trendy areas oh i really like it
[42:32.440 --> 42:39.240]  i really like it you see and i'm only giving you a few examples mechanized scientific rolled out
[42:39.240 --> 42:44.920]  like aliens were doing it or something this is a total rewrite of everything a huge scientific

[42:59.960 --> 43:04.760]  no was frank herbert that said that every rebel
[43:07.960 --> 43:10.920]  is secretly a wannabe aristocrat to paraphrase his quote
[43:13.000 --> 43:16.280]  that's why that's so many elites say to me look just join us you'll get power to get more with
[43:16.280 --> 43:22.200]  us just come on you're a well of of of of you know power and evil i'm not bragging this kind

[43:46.120 --> 43:51.720]  screw each other over and stab each other in the back i won't be part of it when they shovel me
[43:51.720 --> 43:58.120]  into my grave never and i don't want some nanotech blight to get out and kill the atmosphere
[43:59.320 --> 44:04.600]  some andromeda strain that shows up in some laboratory that's the real threat is the super
[44:04.600 --> 44:09.560]  science stuff that's now here that isn't science fiction at all and what the elite are doing
[44:10.520 --> 44:16.440]  is out of control they're out of control and they are in control but they are out of control
[44:16.440 --> 44:21.800]  they are inept
[44:23.000 --> 44:30.120]  toll-free number to join us 800-25-99231 first-time callers again your chance to get involved on
[44:30.120 --> 44:37.640]  air 800-25-99231 800-25-99231 we are living in epic times
[44:37.640 --> 44:47.240]  we are living in incredible times of change the best of times the worst of times a tale of two
[44:47.240 --> 44:52.840]  cities we are here there is so much opportunity there is so much wonderment there is so much
[44:52.840 --> 44:57.720]  incredible things in this wide wide world and universe there is so much goodness there is so
[44:57.720 --> 45:04.120]  much beauty there is so much happening but it's compartmentalized it's atomized and it's scientifically
[45:04.120 --> 45:09.560]  being targeted and that's why you know the globalists are bad because they wage war on virtue
[45:10.200 --> 45:15.800]  they wage war on honor they seek to pull humanity down instead of empowering humanity
[45:15.800 --> 45:17.560]  they've written humanity off
[45:21.880 --> 45:28.760]  they don't need beast of burden anymore they don't need soldiers anymore they're not going to need
[45:28.760 --> 45:39.560]  policing or bureaucrats or lawyers this is the systematic incremental in phases destruction
[45:39.560 --> 45:46.760]  of our species genetically we're already being irrevocably damaged vandalized and in concentric
[45:46.760 --> 45:52.120]  rings the new world order technocrats will pose as the saviors
[45:52.120 --> 46:04.040]  as they are the authors of our destruction and my transmission to you is really a warning to
[46:04.040 --> 46:12.120]  those in the future when there is no doubt that you understand who the authors are and were
[46:12.120 --> 46:22.040]  so that they be convicted in the court of public opinion now and into the future
[46:22.920 --> 46:25.560]  but we are facing a time that
[46:28.120 --> 46:32.360]  will be like none other we've seen before and certainly into the future
[46:32.360 --> 46:41.480]  it's an epic time we are living in the most fantastical science fiction
[46:42.120 --> 46:49.720]  dystopic adventure under hardcore entertainment mind control hardcore trendy control they use our
[46:49.720 --> 46:55.320]  tribal systems of peer pressure and conformity against us
[46:55.320 --> 47:07.080]  they use their knowledge of who we are like a psychopath uses their knowledge to entice a
[47:07.080 --> 47:13.720]  small child into their creeper van we don't admire the psychopath that can trick a child
[47:14.440 --> 47:20.920]  into the van we hate them and love them oh the elite are so smart they know how to lie
[47:20.920 --> 47:27.960]  oh the elite are so cool they know how to deceive you know how to keep a child in a box
[47:28.520 --> 47:34.680]  so they don't know how to talk like skinner did and then talk about how smart you are because
[47:34.680 --> 47:43.240]  you could reduce someone down to nothing that's what you build that's what you do
[47:45.320 --> 47:48.760]  i could do that for you in about 10 seconds just get out on the highway and i'll run over you
[47:48.760 --> 47:56.040]  oh but you do it slow don't you you enjoy sucking the life force out of the innocent
[47:56.840 --> 48:01.480]  holding us down holding humanity down well let me tell you you're not going to hold humanity down
[48:01.480 --> 48:09.240]  forever and just like you step on a cockroach you're not happy when you step on it you catch
[48:09.240 --> 48:16.280]  a big one in your kitchen at night but you say sorry pal and you grab that catalog that came in
[48:16.280 --> 48:21.880]  in the mail that you're going to throw away you go pow you get a napkin scoop him up spray some
[48:21.880 --> 48:27.240]  windex on there throw it in the trash throw it in the toilet i won't take any pleasure
[48:28.600 --> 48:33.400]  and and this energy going out to future humans that will defeat you this energy doesn't take
[48:33.400 --> 48:37.480]  any pleasure in your destruction it just needs to be done because you're a trillion times worse
[48:37.480 --> 48:43.160]  than a cockroach a cockroach fulfills an interest it fulfills a niche of eating dead meat that needs
[48:43.160 --> 48:48.920]  to be cleaned up you kill society so you can feed on the meat you would dumb down the soul
[48:48.920 --> 48:54.360]  civilization so you could chase us down easier and feel more powerful because you're stunted and ugly
[48:54.360 --> 49:00.040]  and twisted and you don't like the strong you don't like the brave you don't like the good it's your
[49:00.040 --> 49:06.280]  fancy to see us fail to see us stumble to see us poisoned to see us confused to see us in pain
[49:06.280 --> 49:14.280]  let's play this professor jonathan gruber they took it off info wars dot com has the report
[49:14.280 --> 49:19.080]  they told fox news they couldn't air it video the mama care architect jonathan gruber saying a
[49:19.080 --> 49:25.080]  lack of transparency was crucial in fueling quote stupid americans which caused controversy was
[49:25.080 --> 49:30.840]  subsequently deleted from the university of pennsylvania only to be reinstated after backlash
[49:30.840 --> 49:37.880]  the trisant effect and they told fox news they couldn't air it so fox news didn't fox news doesn't
[49:37.880 --> 49:42.280]  ask permission to air our stuff they know full well you don't need permission fox news doesn't
[49:42.280 --> 49:46.680]  want to air this the republican leadership doesn't want to get rid of obama care rupert
[49:46.680 --> 49:52.120]  murdoch has endorsed hillary clinton do you understand with this type of video and the
[49:52.120 --> 49:58.760]  other architect admitting it's a screw job we could bring it down let's go to gruber it's just
[49:58.760 --> 50:03.720]  you can't do it politically you just literally cannot do it okay transparent financing unless
[50:03.720 --> 50:09.320]  i transfer anything also transparent spending i mean the this bill was written in a tortured
[50:09.320 --> 50:14.040]  way to make sure cbo did not score the mandate as taxes if cbo scored the mandate's taxes the
[50:14.040 --> 50:20.120]  bill dies okay so it's written to do that in terms of in terms of risk-rated subsidies if you get a
[50:20.120 --> 50:24.200]  law which said healthy people are going to pay in it made explicit the healthy will pay in
[50:24.200 --> 50:29.800]  it sick people get money it would not have passed okay just like the people transparent lack of
[50:29.800 --> 50:34.680]  transparency is a huge political advantage no and basically you know call it the stupidity
[50:34.680 --> 50:39.880]  american voter or whatever but basically that was really really critical to get in the thing to pass
[50:39.880 --> 50:46.760]  yeah like you want to attack when somebody's asleep or exactly or like if you're carjacking
[50:46.760 --> 50:49.720]  somebody you want to do it at night nobody's around you and you don't you want to get them
[50:49.720 --> 50:53.960]  when they're distracted that's just you know it's an advantage to attack somebody from behind yeah
[50:54.840 --> 51:01.480]  these are the professors running the country okay this hour of gcn programming is proudly

[54:06.360 --> 54:12.120]  i was called by the new york times i was called by the la times i was called by new york magazine
[54:12.120 --> 54:19.400]  and a bunch of others in the last few years as they were doing searches i found out why
[54:20.120 --> 54:26.040]  they were wondering how he kept breaking big stories and also uh rob do's nickname is doosopher
[54:27.000 --> 54:31.560]  because he used to yell at some of the tv crew i mean he's really nice but you know he would he
[54:31.560 --> 54:37.800]  would gripe at him so the marcos morales started calling doosopher and put a name tag on his uh
[54:37.800 --> 54:43.560]  on his desk said doosopher and so a couple times they would ask me and who's doosopher
[54:44.520 --> 54:47.320]  because i'd said that on air and it had been in transcripts and i said that's where i'd do
[54:47.960 --> 54:55.320]  and i had to explain no i'm not goosopher well goosopher has gone public and paul watz has
[54:55.320 --> 55:00.920]  got a video report up on info wars dot com he's going to be joining us in the next hour this just
[55:00.920 --> 55:06.920]  broke when i saw this report during the break it sent chills down my spine because you know
[55:06.920 --> 55:11.160]  about the missing nukes out of dais air force base within days of us saying that lindsay
[55:11.160 --> 55:16.440]  graham said prepare for the east coast to be nuked that was in cbs news i mean that really did
[55:16.440 --> 55:21.960]  happen you notice the base never when it was in newspapers and stuff us saying it never responded
[55:21.960 --> 55:28.760]  and said that's ridiculous because there was a big scene with the base security they said you
[55:28.760 --> 55:33.080]  got a sign for this or not he's supposed to be nukes here where are these 18 wheelers going
[55:33.080 --> 55:38.280]  and the base commander came out and did a written order and said stand out and the police because
[55:38.280 --> 55:43.560]  they had private police there almost didn't do it because the military they was freaking out
[55:43.560 --> 55:48.200]  i mean i mean do you really think we want to just break stuff like that and it's not true
[55:49.880 --> 55:58.840]  well goosopher has hacked a lot of top people and the word is goosopher hacked into uh and they
[55:58.840 --> 56:08.680]  and the plan is to nuke chicago now it's funny because i remember seeing it on cnn he did this
[56:08.680 --> 56:14.600]  before 9 11 but also after gary heart and warren redmond of the gary the the heart
[56:14.600 --> 56:22.280]  robin commission of the council on farm relations was on television i think it was cnn we got to
[56:22.280 --> 56:29.400]  find that clip and he said chicago dallas cleveland and denver will be nuked by terrorist
[56:30.840 --> 56:36.680]  and then it was like a weird message out to everybody and they do this just like he sent
[56:36.680 --> 56:41.160]  that letter to ocment energy saying yeah we stage 9 11 and we'll stage other stuff and
[56:41.160 --> 56:46.680]  blame it on you and then published it in the huffington post was thinly veiled he said you know
[56:46.680 --> 56:51.240]  we stage stuff the main things like that don't think we won't attack you just because the public's
[56:51.240 --> 57:00.120]  against it you better do what we say and i ran pretty much did so see for whatever reason you
[57:00.120 --> 57:04.360]  know larry silverstein went and bought the sears tower and all that we were on two affiliates in
[57:04.360 --> 57:15.480]  chicago there's major indicators they're going to hit chicago and i don't know when and i've told
[57:15.480 --> 57:19.000]  you about a nuclear false flag to bring in marshal law this is a big deal we're going to talk to

[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:56.200]  um but i wanted to talk well that's not just a creepy guy that's that's that's one of the
[01:02:56.200 --> 01:03:02.280]  main obama architects of the screw job known as obama care oh yeah i've been spreading that

[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:22.920]  your whole crew um and i i really never understood the depths of the freedom of press until um i
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:27.320]  really see what you guys are doing and you're spending your people in the hairy situations and
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:33.400]  i want to tell you that me and my family are praying for you guys um i i was out actually at the
[01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:39.000]  buddy ranch and i saw josh and and david night out there and i can't tell you how much it touched
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:45.320]  me that you were spending your people out there um and and it you know to know that we people were
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:50.360]  going to see what happened that day there was two reporters there i mean um and and you guys were one
[01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:58.280]  of them and i just really want to thank you um for that it was very important um and i'm also
[01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:05.960]  about gmo labeling i have um some thoughts on that i don't know if you um i'm a small farmer
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:12.840]  from nevada basically and i um i understand the movement for labeling and and and things of that
[01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:19.000]  nature but i think it'll put undue cost on you having to prove and certify everything
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.360]  that's kind of the fear mongering i've seen because i got family that are that are that are
[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:29.400]  farmers as well and it'll just be the co-ops or where you sell it through uh then then the the
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:34.600]  private certifiers will go out and then they'll certify that it's organic but i mean finish your
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:43.000]  point sorry my point is is i i truly truly trust in the free market and i think that as the ambassador
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:48.360]  of the free market i really think that we should be about repealing um that money would be really
[01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:54.200]  well spent repealing what we can't say rather than trying to make um someone put a label on what you
[01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:59.880]  can already find out already well i agree i mean if people should just label it aging starts at the
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:06.680]  cellular level when cells become toxic they die early and aging sets in in the past decade we

[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:33.320]  hour or or the nightly news at the end of the last hour paul watson's report broke at info wars dot
[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:41.800]  com and prison planet dot com it's red linked top hacker chicago nuke attack plan for 2015
[01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:48.360]  gucifer now to be clear i've been contacted to show how i've been connected to this and just by
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:53.720]  the media's research even though i'm not connected to it we've been contacted by l.a times new york
[01:08:53.720 --> 01:09:01.560]  times new york uh daily news new york magazine for some reason all the new york outfits rolling
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:11.400]  stone again and a bunch of others wanting to talk to me about gucifer and basically you're
[01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:16.120]  saying well you leak a lot of stuff you have a lot of breaking stuff are you gucifer or is he
[01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:21.800]  giving you info or is she giving you info we don't know who or didn't know now of course more of
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:29.560]  its known uh who gucifer is but it's one of the top hackers in the world you know we've had captain
[01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:34.760]  crunch on who's a listener and he's the top grand daddy hacker but he's not currently the top hacker
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:43.160]  and gucifer has been very credible
[01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:51.160]  and so paul watson filed this three-minute report we're going to play it then go to paul
[01:09:51.160 --> 01:10:01.880]  watson in london but i want to remind you and we'll go to a document cam shot here for tv viewers
[01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:09.480]  that back in september of last year we broke this news dais refuses to deny secret nuke transfer
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:19.640]  dais officially responds to secret nuke transfer refuses to deny and it's right down the road from
[01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:27.320]  the big company that is the only company in the u.s that demilitarizes them deactivates them
[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:33.880]  pan tex but they weren't going to pan tex they were going to lindsay graham's district within
[01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:39.480]  hours of his breaking this graham comes out on cbs news and says a nuke attack is imminent
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:47.640]  in in in the carolina's are in georgia or in new york the exclusive high-level source confirms
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:55.400]  secret u.s nuclear warhead transfer off the books to obama senator grand warms of nuke strike after
[01:10:55.400 --> 01:11:00.680]  missing warhead report you can go read the cbs report in our story watch the video in fact if
[01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:08.680]  you scroll down for tv viewers there's a cbs article by the way they went and changed the
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:19.240]  article about a day later they do a lot of that now so i don't know exactly what's going on
[01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:27.880]  on but we've played the clip before somebody could probably find it he said it on cnn
[01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:34.840]  and he said a similar thing on fox the head of the heart rubbing commission gary heart
[01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:39.800]  said and remember before 9 11 and we played this clip at nauseam
[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:46.600]  he basically said a huge terror attacks coming to change where we live our lives
[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:50.840]  once it happened he said on c span we to use this disaster to bring in what president
[01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:55.560]  bush's father called for a new world order and make lemonade out of these lemons
[01:11:56.920 --> 01:12:03.320]  well he said dallas cleveland chicago and denver would be hit by terrorist nuke
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:11.560]  and we see preparations in the brainwashing of the military and police that patriots in the
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:16.120]  military might get nukes and detonate them and then we see shows like jericho where a private
[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:22.680]  security company like haliburton or groups like it i guess you'd say something like
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:34.920]  xz formerly blackwater does it to bring in marshal law post apocalyptic action drama series
[01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:42.600]  airden cbs from 2006 2008 so this is out there but when you hear us talk about it it's not coming
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:47.960]  from conjecture it's coming from high-level sources now remember we first reported this
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:54.920]  people didn't believe it it was in the local news there was a big frackish and then our sources said
[01:12:56.040 --> 01:13:02.600]  wane madson actually at the time broke it that it was missing high-tech cruise missiles four of them
[01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:10.280]  the media said two on a b-52 going down to louisiana and we had sources down there that said it was four
[01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:14.200]  well then had a buddy still in the air force down there and saw it all happen
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:23.560]  and they were trying to disappear chainie was four high-tech cruise missiles so let's get something
[01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:29.480]  straight there's real smoke here that means there's fire in fact i can see fire in the smoke i don't
[01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:34.120]  know exactly how bad it is it's like pulling up to a house fire in a fire department you don't know
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:40.680]  how bad it is to get inside generally it could explode any minute i don't know how bad it is but
[01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:46.520]  it it stinks and this would be the perfect way to make obama look like a victim his town his people
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.520]  i don't know how big a nuke they would detonate we're on two affiliates in chicago
[01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:57.240]  i'm not in the business here to scare people i'm not the one originating this report
[01:13:57.240 --> 01:14:03.880]  it's a top hacker who's released hundreds of documented real hacks and is the premiere hacker
[01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:09.480]  probably a consortium of hackers trying to warn people though they claim it's one guy now
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:13.560]  let's play paul watchers report go to it and then your phone calls and we'll get to your phone calls
[01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:17.720]  i have moved the guest that was coming up at the bottom of the hour uh let's go ahead and go to
[01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:24.760]  paul watchers report filed just 20 minutes ago at info wars dot com gucifer the romanian hacker
[01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:29.320]  who accessed private email accounts of numerous top government and military officials as well as
[01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:36.680]  the bush family is quoted in the new york times as predicting a nuclear attack on chicago sometime
[01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:43.960]  in 2015 having eluded the fbi and the secret service for years gucifer real name marcel lasar
[01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:49.640]  infamously hacked george w bush's creepy self-portraits while also accessing email
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:55.400]  accounts belonging to colin paul as well as military officers and celebrities he is now
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:15:01.400]  serving a seven-year prison sentence in romania explaining the purpose behind his hacking which
[01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:07.000]  was conducted merely by guessing the security answers to people's email accounts to obtain their
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:13.160]  passwords gucifer's manifesto is quote a potpourri of conspiracy theories about the terrorist attacks
[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:21.880]  of september 11 2001 the 1997 death of princess diana and alleged plans for a nuclear attack
[01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:28.920]  in chicago in 2015 and whether you believe it to be the work of a conspiracy or a plot crafted
[01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:35.880]  by a group like isis the fact is that chicago has been a terror target since 9 11 earlier this summer
[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:42.520]  the fbi warned that isis were planning to target major us cities after the terror group put out a
[01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:48.680]  series of chilling tweets identifying the old republic building in chicago as being in the
[01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:54.760]  crosshairs gucifer also makes another intriguing comment during the new york times interview
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:16:01.480]  quote this world is run by a group of conspirators called the council of illuminati very rich people
[01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:07.640]  noble families bankers and industrialists from the 19th and 20th century of course a far cry from
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:14.440]  the original 18th century bavarian illuminati the modern incarnation largely centers around claims
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:19.640]  by hip hop artists and other members of the entertainment industry that they're part of an
[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:26.680]  occult secret elite that controls the planet in name checking the illuminati gucifer is most
[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:33.080]  likely making the general point that global events are coordinated and managed to some extent by elite
[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:38.360]  banking families just as they have been down the centuries but what's your view on gucifer's
[01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:46.840]  comments about the illuminati and a nuclear attack on chicago in 2015 let me know in the comments below
[01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:50.840]  check out the other videos subscribe to the channel i'm paul joseph wassen reporting for

[01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:22.040]  corporation on record saying nukes will hit these cities and they'll totally take our rights as a
[01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:28.120]  alert to their own mid-level minions obviously or you can elaborate on why you think they do it now
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:32.760]  you've got the missing nukes and just people freaking out the base i mean there were guns out
[01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:37.880]  of the dias folks this was unbelievable uh we've got that going on no one ever said we were liars
[01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:42.600]  about that you notice because it happened they might have been dummy nukes or something i don't
[01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:51.080]  know but they were told they were nukes they weren't going to pin tax uh so paul looking at
[01:17:54.600 --> 01:18:01.800]  gucifer coming out who did get into all these top people's emails i mean they admitted this was
[01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:07.240]  all real he really did this and more and i know they claim he's the only person operating that name
[01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:11.400]  i don't think that's the case from what i've studied and seen obviously it's now coming out that
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:16.280]  schnoden is not one person uh but a consortium group and i'm not even sure exactly who he's working
[01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:20.440]  for but that's another subject this cloak and dagger stuff gets into that we're trying to reveal
[01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:25.080]  the cloak and dagger to people so that the tricks don't work anymore the way to beat this system is
[01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:31.160]  to expose it and to bring in a more honorable chivalry based system which is more secure for
[01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:36.520]  everybody uh you know true security true peace true prosperity paul what's what's your gut on all this
[01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:43.720]  well what's interesting about it alex is you know it came out in this new york times article which
[01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:49.480]  came out last night they visited the transylvanian prison in which he's serving this seven-year
[01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:55.800]  sentence and he basically said to them look before i answer any questions i'm going to read out this
[01:18:55.800 --> 01:19:03.880]  manifesto as to why i did this hacking and what the purpose of it was so he obviously expected them
[01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:09.400]  at least to some extent to reprint some of his manifesto because it was a condition of the
[01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:15.960]  interview itself that's what it says in the article but all they afford to it is one dismissive
[01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:22.840]  paragraph in which they mention you know 9 11 the death of princess diana and the alleged plot
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:29.480]  plan to attack chicago with a nuclear weapon in 2015 so obviously this was a and they talk later
[01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:35.320]  about how he makes extensive notes about all these plots which obviously he's gone and some knowledge
[01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:41.080]  of yeah now obviously this is where people still fall for it it's the new york times just like
[01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:46.760]  snowden tried to talk to them first and all they did was cattle on him you go to the cia you go to
[01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:51.000]  the new york times that's who they are you go to the carney endowment for peace that's really
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:57.400]  they're above the cia above the state department you go to this trust and you expect them to then
[01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:04.200]  make you credible it's the opposite and and this is how the trolls are they're on info wars.com
[01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:08.760]  freaking out about this right now and on youtube saying we're liars we're reporting on the new york
[01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:14.200]  times they're saying we made this up see paul because they're not really trolls we've tracked
[01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:18.760]  some of the ip addresses before these are coming out of government servers paul they don't even
[01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:23.560]  incorporate servers they don't even try to hide it now just like the obama administration guys
[01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:28.120]  saying you know the public's dumb we like to them it's sort of plan to rip them off they just hope
[01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:33.240]  people are dumb and don't check they'll probably say that this uh you know gooseifer guy uh or
[01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:39.480]  gucifer doesn't even exist as well uh the point is this may stop a chicago nuke attack and then
[01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:44.760]  we don't get thanked for that or gucifer doesn't get thanked instead they'll just say he doesn't
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:51.480]  exist but it's only the public being so weak minded that allows this to happen well i mean the
[01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:56.200]  screenshot from the new york times is in the video i will i will add it to the article with the link
[01:20:56.200 --> 01:21:01.560]  to the new york times so the time that's not good enough i'll look i'll just call you racist and
[01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:07.320]  that'll that'll shut you down i don't need facts i don't need to be intellectual racist that's gonna
[01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:15.480]  do it yeah i just need no one word sorry paul go ahead um but again the concern is he's had access
[01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:23.160]  to the emails rock a fat fella family bush family council on foreign relations fbi secret service
[01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:30.280]  aids to bill clinton uh george tenet richard armitage john negroponte the list goes on and on
[01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:36.920]  secret service romanian intelligence that's where he was arrested he breaks in he has the intel
[01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:41.240]  he gives it to him and they don't want the story of the century with a confirmed hacker
[01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:45.800]  that's like nothing but truth no it's just aha he says chicago is going to get note
[01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:52.040]  yeah it's this dismissed in a sentence it's completely ridiculous i mean that's why we exist
[01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:56.600]  to pick up on that kind of thing and make it into a story just like forbs last week goes yeah we're
[01:21:56.600 --> 01:22:00.200]  in a meeting with the media with the cdc we're supposed to cover up what appears to be a public
[01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:06.680]  cases you know gucciardi went up to dalis paul and talked to more doctors and they're like oh yeah
[01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:10.280]  this is definitely going on they're covering up a public cases and they're scared they go
[01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:13.400]  we don't like covering it up because we're going to be liable we think the government will leave
[01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:18.680]  us holding the bag now i'm not saying it's pandemic and we're all dead but clearly paul there is a
[01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:23.560]  bola here and there and they're covering it up i mean it's not fun to live in a country where the
[01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:29.160]  media and everybody goes along with lies this is not making us secure it's making us insecure paul
[01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:33.480]  and we're not even going to know if they are covering up to what extent because the media
[01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:37.960]  has agreed not to report on any of the cases there's actually a flight that went out of
[01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:43.960]  grand canaria remember when those Ebola potentially bola victims they had Ebola symptoms washed up on
[01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:48.280]  a beach in grand canary these african illegal immigrants they were just dumped out on the
[01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:51.800]  beach everybody freaked out yeah vomiting with blood running out their irans yeah
[01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:56.040]  yeah it turns out there was a flight that went from grand canaria i think it was to
[01:22:56.600 --> 01:23:02.120]  andrew's air force base looking into that now if that was a secret transfer for potential
[01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:06.840]  treatment of Ebola victims which if it's the case the media is not going to report on it because
[01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:12.600]  they've been sworn to secrecy all right get back into the nukes i've been erupting because this
[01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:18.600]  gets me so upset so excited in a bad way start over paul with again for folks that just joined us
[01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:23.960]  new york times meets gets what's in the emails of the world elite rockefellers you name it new
[01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:30.360]  chicago and the idiots at the new york times just think it's all a big joke yeah this is
[01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:35.240]  goosey for old goosey for who was a hacker for several years very prominent over the past several
[01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:41.240]  years out of transylvania he lived in romania he hacked into the personal email accounts
[01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:45.960]  technically he didn't even hack he gathered information from the internet and guessed the
[01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:51.640]  passwords so he wasn't even um breaking some of those hacking laws obviously he got in illegally
[01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:57.000]  but he just guessed the security answers and the passwords bush family he was the guy who released
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:03.400]  the uh bush self portraits he also hacked the rockefeller family members of the council on
[01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:10.360]  forum relations aids to bill clinton fbi secret service members um george tenet former cia richard
[01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:16.040]  armitage john negroponte so he hacked all these accounts there's actually a scandal with colin
[01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:22.040]  powell who he also hacked where this romanian politician was sending nude photos of herself
[01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:26.840]  to colin powell so he had to come out and admit that he'd been hacked and then deny that he was
[01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:30.760]  having an affair with her so this was all confirmed that he was getting into these accounts he was
[01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:37.480]  arrested in romania back in january he was indicted in abstentia in virginia back in june
[01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:43.960]  now he's in prison for seven years in romania he came out to the new york time said look i'll only
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:48.760]  i'll do an interview with you but only if you print this manifesto this long manifesto that he
[01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:57.320]  read out before he agreed to any questions in that manifesto was alleged plot to attack chicago
[01:24:57.320 --> 01:25:04.360]  with a nuclear weapon in 2015 but it was dismissed by the new york times in a paragraph as some kind
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:10.760]  of um paranoid conspiracy theory alongside the death of princess diana and 911 let me say this
[01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:18.520]  let me say this to gucci for we want your manifesto we will print it in a whole info wars.com is ready
[01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:22.760]  so you just i know they probably aren't letting him get info out because they're all scared of what
[01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:27.640]  he's got you know we've got romanian listeners that have sent us bilderberg footage and stuff from
[01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:33.480]  istanbul turkey uh that we have that guy's phone number jacobson has it we ought to get a hold
[01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:39.160]  of our romanian sources and deputize them as a reporter and send them in if he can get in of
[01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:42.840]  course they may have only let the new york times in to see him because they knew he'd spin it
[01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:47.240]  this is outrageous paul paul you want to get on a plane i'll pay for it you're ready to go to
[01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:52.680]  transylvania buddy they say it's beautiful maybe that's something we can talk about your only your
[01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:59.640]  only three hours away saddle up let's go but the only thing they actually printed out of his manifesto
[01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:04.280]  was the quote this world is run by a group of conspirators called the council of illuminati
[01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:09.640]  very rich people noble families bankers and industrialists from the 19th and 20th century
[01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:15.720]  so they reprinted that part of it then later on they talk about him making extensive filling
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:21.560]  notebooks with conspiracy theories in small neat tan writings so he's obviously writing down everything
[01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:26.680]  that you learned through these emails and they're they're dismissing it as paranoid conspiracy theories
[01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:34.280]  well obviously the police sees all those copies of the stuff i mean gucifer gucifer released the
[01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:40.280]  paintings of bush and him and the bathtub and more so they've got the intel and so the good news is
[01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:46.280]  we know about the chicago nook plan uh they think we're so dumb they had heart brag about it 10 years
[01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:53.000]  ago so how many times have i said i think chicago is the major false flag target with a new paul
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:27:00.520]  how many times numerous times in fact i think there was a plot involving a terrorist to attack
[01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:05.080]  a building in chicago but the building wasn't even built when the plot was supposed to happen so
[01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:10.440]  it's been in the works for a while of course if it happened they probably blame it on somebody
[01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:17.240]  like isis because we had these stories from back in august about isis tweeting pictures of threats
[01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:23.160]  made against chicago buildings like the old republic building which is in chicago there was another
[01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:30.520]  story um this year again in august man arrested for making bonfire in chicago after he flew an isis
[01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:35.880]  flag from his car and led police on a chase so you know whether it's going to be by isis or
[01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:41.960]  blamed on isis or patsies or whatever as he said definitely chicago has been a big target since at
[01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:48.840]  least 9 11 that's right we're putting the cbs news story up about the isis plan is being protected
[01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:55.720]  by you know who the criminal globalist running our government it's just a fact but this also goes to
[01:27:55.720 --> 01:28:07.240]  david rockefeller colon pal uh all these top gangsters sure they're in control of things
[01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:12.360]  they've got all these super weapons they've had all these scientists build them all this but they
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:18.280]  don't know how to run it all they're too lazy not to have uh nonsense pass codes that nobody
[01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:25.000]  can figure out i mean any i'm not a tech guy but i don't use names it's scrambled uppercase lowercase
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:31.960]  you know gibberish symbols but they're lazy i mean obviously these people don't uphold any security
[01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:39.160]  any preparations because they think everyone's totally dumb but so what 10 15 percent are super
[01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:45.480]  smart so they're operating as if all the seven million people are idiots when there's probably
[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:51.080]  like 500 million people that are as smart as they are we're just not psychopaths so i don't know how
[01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:56.040]  they that shows how all the other technologies and things they've got we're all in danger folks
[01:28:56.760 --> 01:29:01.400]  they're green lighting open air pharmacological crops that scientists say i'll probably kill
[01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:08.840]  everybody you know hiv and corn uh hepatitis and corn uh super funguses that could spread to the
[01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:18.600]  atmosphere and make interstellar a real reality the andromeda strain a real reality i just shudder
[01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:24.520]  at how bad these people are paul well and the point with the passwords because we had the story
[01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:30.040]  last week about the security cameras across the world most people never bothered to change the
[01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:36.680]  default password so it's like you know admin and then password so this website itself direct access
[01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:41.960]  to people's bedrooms and living rooms with these private security cameras across the world because
[01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:47.480]  people failed to change that's right was it 300 000 cameras or something just so far every country
[01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:53.320]  yeah thank you paul great job march the empire keep watching it run alex jones articles on this

[01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:09.000]  just trying to be sensational no we're not trying to be sensational i could have been a lot bigger
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:15.480]  and been syndicated a lot faster and made more money selling out to the establishment i could make
[01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:17.480]  talking about anything interesting
[01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:25.240]  but i will not sell my soul out to the fraud of the new world order

[01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:05.560]  our clothing line is so popular it's all selling out or our supplements are so good
[01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:10.360]  better get it quick it's about to sell out we only say that when something's really selling out
[01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:16.680]  and you don't like to have a bunch of product at the end of the year because of taxes so we
[01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:22.520]  tend to try to budget enough to order stuff in in the fall and then we don't order any other t-shirts
[01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:29.800]  books videos supplements from the laboratories until new years i've had to put in rush emergency
[01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:36.360]  orders for everything everything is shelling out except stuff that was already sold out
[01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:41.640]  like the new mystery stuff that we haven't announced yet that has never been sold out

[01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:39.800]  and the fact that a show this hardcore is on 170 something stations and dominating the internet
[01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:43.560]  i mean it's just shows there's still a lot of good people in government a lot of good people in

[01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:52.680]  supporting us and americans didn't want to believe all this stuff was true now they know how much
[01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:58.520]  trouble we're in and i'm not here to even demonize the system i just wanted to change i don't want
[01:39:58.520 --> 01:40:04.840]  to take these people on but i got to it's like when you get mugged or something you make the
[01:40:04.840 --> 01:40:09.560]  decision am i gonna let this person take my wallet and probably go ahead and beat me over the head
[01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:14.680]  for fun or you know what i'm gonna go ahead and punch them right in the throat and all gee i
[01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:18.040]  shouldn't have rammed their head into that concrete i might have to tell the cops why they're in a
[01:40:18.040 --> 01:40:24.520]  coma i'm gonna probably go to jail but when they see the rap sheet they'll let me out and it's just
[01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:28.600]  it's happened to me twice being mugged and the person pulls a knife or whatever and i'm just
[01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:32.920]  like you know i'm gonna have to hurt you now and you know what i'm kind of ashamed of it lord
[01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:39.080]  i'm gonna enjoy it and it's not that i'm a sadist i like to hurt innocent people i just i have this
[01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:44.440]  thing where i just i actually do like hurting bad people and i try to repent of it i shouldn't
[01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:48.920]  enjoy it sometimes and it's been a long time so i do something like that but you know it's an analogy
[01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:56.280]  of of of the world politically i fight with words i fight with my heart i fight with the truth and i
[01:40:56.280 --> 01:41:03.160]  want to with words really hurt the globalist i really do hate this professor that helped
[01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:07.000]  write the obama care plan and helped deceive congress and the public laughing at us calling
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:12.520]  us stupid and how they lied to us and snickering and giggling i don't want to physically hurt him
[01:41:12.520 --> 01:41:17.960]  that make him a martyr or a victim i want to savage him with the truth i want to show him
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:23.000]  that abusing people and ripping people off isn't funny i want to get that smirk off his face you
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:29.720]  know what i mean let's go ahead and talk to tony tony in no no i'm sorry tony was up next but
[01:41:29.720 --> 01:41:34.120]  actually i'm going to richard's he's been all the longest uh richard in maryland sorry uh you're on
[01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:40.760]  the air on veterans day go ahead good morning alex welcome brother good morning alex welcome
[01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:49.400]  i'm a 27 year army veteran sergeant and i'm gonna tell you why i am on the most wanted
[01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:58.440]  list of a llama because i took my oath to office to defend and protect the constitution against
[01:41:58.440 --> 01:42:05.160]  all enemies born and domestic seriously and i still consider myself obligated under that oath
[01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:14.360]  and that's why i always vote for liberty loving candidates well that's right the veterans uh
[01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:19.800]  combat veterans are the most wanted most hated by homeland security but that doesn't mean homeland
[01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:25.240]  security on average is even bad that's woken them up why do you think obama and the globalists
[01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:30.600]  thought they could get away with saying veterans are the number one enemy because they're afraid of
[01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:41.960]  veterans because the president will fight back if needed and they're not being fooled by obama
[01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:50.760]  obama sucks well you're right brother veterans will fight back veterans aren't afraid to die
[01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:56.760]  a lot of them are ready to die they've been treated like crap and they're trying to get a civil war
[01:42:56.760 --> 01:43:02.520]  started with veterans so i want veterans to fight smart with their minds as long as possible and
[01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:07.560]  that if it does go to a shooting war we need to not get in the civil war they want with the cops
[01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:15.480]  we need to defend ourselves and we know who the enemy is don't we yes we do and i say to root
[01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:22.760]  pal go baby go god bless your brother on veterans day you know people could say all america's wars
[01:43:22.760 --> 01:43:27.720]  and you know veterans day listen a lot of people got put in harm's way and they were bad wars but
[01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:31.960]  they were fighting for their family for their buddies beside them they were lied to about why
[01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:36.840]  they went to these wars and are treated like crap afterwards they go and they fight proxy armies
[01:43:36.840 --> 01:43:42.680]  built by the globalists secretly like al-qaeda they really were fighting al-qaeda and and extremists
[01:43:42.680 --> 01:43:49.080]  in many cases and they're hated because now the age of men is coming to an end according to our
[01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:53.960]  controllers and it's the age of the machines and the technocracy and the age of pharmacological
[01:43:53.960 --> 01:44:00.920]  and chemical and radiological warfare by the elite against us and so we need to understand if the
[01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:07.720]  globalists hate the veterans by extension the police i mean come on same thing then they
[01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:16.760]  need to not be our enemies it's very simple if the new world order is coming after somebody
[01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:23.320]  there's a reason for it and nine times out of ten is because they're good and in them is the hope
[01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:27.640]  but it's not just to the veterans our hope it's to all of us we're all veterans of a
[01:44:27.640 --> 01:44:32.680]  propaganda war we're all veterans of the vaccine war and the fluoride war and the gmo war being
[01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:36.760]  carried out against us you need to realize that folks you are under new world order attack
[01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:45.880]  whether you believe that or not whether you work for him or not you have not been exempted
[01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:48.280]  so on this veterans day remember
[01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:54.440]  the troops are veterans of the vaccine program ten times what it is for the public
[01:44:55.080 --> 01:45:00.440]  the troops are the are the victims of the testing that the political class that hates them has done
[01:45:00.440 --> 01:45:02.440]  i
[01:45:05.160 --> 01:45:11.000]  see paten it's coming up to talk about that let's talk to tony and then ryan tony and fema region
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:16.840]  three what former state are you calling me from now under fema control pennsylvania alex all right
[01:45:16.840 --> 01:45:24.600]  brother what's on your mind um i just want to recommend a guest um a man named carl k a r l
[01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:31.640]  lent l e n tz and uh he has a talk shoot program uh he helps people for free basically getting
[01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:38.360]  their kids back from cps and what he's done is he's made he's basically uh deciphered the court
[01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:43.880]  system how to actually access the common law you know how to not go in there as the legal person
[01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:47.640]  you know we ever we all go in there as defendants playing the role of the legal person
[01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:53.480]  where he teaches in one or two lines to write a a claim they always come in with complaints
[01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:59.800]  and we have to come in with a claim and as a man you trump their agency and as the claim trumps
[01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:04.760]  sure well it's time to get alfred a desk on and all those guys and uh some of the constitutional
[01:46:04.760 --> 01:46:10.760]  lawyers that put out real patriot uh information not patriot mythology i'm not saying the guy you
[01:46:10.760 --> 01:46:14.440]  are talking about does that i don't know who he is but i don't get into it a lot because it's a
[01:46:14.440 --> 01:46:19.880]  minefield you can push people into legitimate stuff it's very complex and then they get off into
[01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:26.120]  into what they call um you know paper terrorism that'll that will get you locked under the jail
[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:30.920]  but yeah a lot of statistics show pro-state litigants if they really know what they're doing
[01:46:31.480 --> 01:46:38.760]  are doing better uh in many cases uh than the lawyers uh the average lawyer will just
[01:46:38.760 --> 01:46:43.160]  collect money and sell it on the river if you get a top lawyer it they actually are into having
[01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:47.880]  a really good win record and want to win but you will pay through the nose for that uh thank you
[01:46:47.880 --> 01:46:54.520]  so much great points ryan in colorado you're on the year hey alice great to talk to you finally
[01:46:54.520 --> 01:47:00.840]  um i'm calling in i want to know about the um what you think about the outcome um in furgus
[01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:09.080]  and rosary with that push um the un gun treaty ban even more and one more question was uh i live
[01:47:09.080 --> 01:47:14.120]  in colorado spring of colorado and um i'm surrounded by veterans everywhere i go
[01:47:14.120 --> 01:47:21.960]  and would you put it past the elite to possibly send a nuke this way to colorado spring well if i
[01:47:21.960 --> 01:47:27.160]  was a foreign enemy that's exactly what i would nuke would be colorado springs because that's the
[01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:35.800]  site of the real u.s government and north com you know just outside denver and that is exactly
[01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:41.320]  where all the big underground bases and bunkers are in the nukes and uh they've got a whole congress
[01:47:41.320 --> 01:47:46.760]  there ready to go and i mean if i was a terrorist again they're always going to hit a populist
[01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:54.760]  area like dalas or chicago if they want to terrorize us and it won't be the un it won't be um it won't
[01:47:54.760 --> 01:48:00.840]  be the you know the capital or wherever a real terrorist would hit um if i was some foreign
[01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:07.000]  terrorist group i would hit the congress or i would hit something like colorado springs or
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:11.320]  i'd blow up the un and again before they put the new york times that i would blow it up i'm saying
[01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:14.840]  if i was a terrorist i would never do anything like that anything offensive plus i wouldn't
[01:48:14.840 --> 01:48:18.920]  have a nuke i don't know my life so bizarre they might deliver one here one day i have no idea but
[01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:27.560]  you know getting serious here yes i think you're in a major terrorist spot you're in a and if there
[01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:33.000]  was ever a government coup counter coup let's say north com and general demcy decided to not go along
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:38.200]  with the new king of chicago um then they would nuke they would get all the generals together for
[01:48:38.200 --> 01:48:43.720]  some meeting and then nuke them in colorado springs or get everybody meeting at camp david and and
[01:48:43.720 --> 01:48:48.120]  nuke the military leadership i mean basically here's the deal once you go into tyranny there is no
[01:48:48.120 --> 01:48:52.840]  security the sky's the limit uh so yeah no i think you're in a pretty dangerous place colorado springs
[01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:58.520]  all right well thank you for the information oh one more thing uh did yeah go ahead un gun
[01:48:58.520 --> 01:49:03.240]  treaty is there um do you have any more information from the un gun treaty at all oh yeah i meant to
[01:49:03.240 --> 01:49:07.800]  answer that thank you for the call um yeah they the un treaty says the civilian ownership of
[01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:12.120]  firearms should be abolished that threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state
[01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:17.240]  that's the text of the treaty and it puts in all sorts of arms restrictions and ammo restrictions
[01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:21.960]  and global regulations and obama says he'll follow it even if congress doesn't doesn't
[01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:25.720]  erratify the senate doesn't ratify which they say they won't they've warned him not to
[01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:31.880]  do and uh yeah mass riots across the u.s is what brought gun control in the 60s why would you
[01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:36.280]  restrict people's guns because there's looting all over the country in detroit and places
[01:49:37.240 --> 01:49:43.320]  it's guns that help stop it so i mean mobs don't go down the street usually in cities where
[01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:46.920]  everybody's armed because you start trying to burn down somebody's business they're gonna shoot you
[01:49:47.800 --> 01:49:51.960]  i'm not looking for trouble but you come on my property the mob comes down the road to my house
[01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:57.000]  there's a nine-foot fence around it and barbed wire inside that doesn't look like an army base
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:03.400]  it looks real nice but it is basically a base and um got the heavy door the whole nine yards
[01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:07.720]  you're gonna be met with resistance and not because i'm a tough guy i'm not gonna roll over
[01:50:08.280 --> 01:50:13.320]  my instinct is to fight it feels good not because it's this thing good going with your
[01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:19.160]  gut and what you're meant to do also feels good see that's why they've held off on the civil war
[01:50:19.160 --> 01:50:24.200]  until they think they can win it they understand americans love to fight and if they really want
[01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:27.960]  to start a civil war it's it's going to be unbelievable the problem is they want to wipe
[01:50:27.960 --> 01:50:33.400]  out the police and military and they plan on us wiping them out in the civil war and so that's why
[01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:39.960]  i've said civil war starts i'm just going to try to stay in a location broadcast and i'm not going
[01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:44.360]  to be off i'm not a military person i'm not going to be a george washington out there trying to

[02:02:02.600 --> 02:02:08.920]  program last week uh during the elections in it and it was a blurb that came on once i haven't
[02:02:08.920 --> 02:02:19.720]  heard anywhere else that uh was it eight or ten uh generals i guess and higher ranking on visuals
[02:02:19.720 --> 02:02:27.560]  were released most of which were released because of um loss of confidence and one on mb yeah no no

[02:10:24.440 --> 02:10:30.120]  helped found delta force with general blakin and of course ran psyops for the state department
[02:10:30.120 --> 02:10:36.440]  and advised the u.s army and of course he is a composite character the jack ryan character
[02:10:36.440 --> 02:10:40.760]  nobody probably knows who that is nowadays uh from the patriot games and wrote a bunch of
[02:10:40.760 --> 02:10:45.720]  books with tom clancy he has a new book that he advised on that just came out as well and
[02:10:45.720 --> 02:10:49.560]  he's also as a medical company that he never talks about him again we talk about that at the bottom

[02:10:58.040 --> 02:11:05.320]  and we'll do another bank of callers just specifically for pacinic 800-25-99231 trained
[02:11:05.320 --> 02:11:10.920]  in psychiatry at harvard university and international relations at mit his novels are based on over
[02:11:10.920 --> 02:11:15.960]  20 years experience resolving international crises he's a top hostage negotiator for the
[02:11:15.960 --> 02:11:20.200]  department of state and for four administrations and he's of course a member of the council on
[02:11:20.200 --> 02:11:26.600]  farm relations and came on my show back in 2002 and said that 9-11 was an inside job and that
[02:11:26.600 --> 02:11:30.200]  bin laden was dead and their government was financing radical muslims and letting us attack us
[02:11:30.200 --> 02:11:36.120]  and ordering stand downs uh the cfr called up threatening him at the time and i remember he
[02:11:36.120 --> 02:11:41.320]  called me he goes yes they're visiting me yes they're very upset that transcript oh boy uh i guess
[02:11:41.320 --> 02:11:46.680]  leave it up but what do you think and well the rest is history and then basically stuff he's
[02:11:46.680 --> 02:11:53.320]  covered on the air has been attacked by stratford which again is an admitted cia um echo chamber
[02:11:53.320 --> 02:11:57.160]  because the cia is not supposed to be involved in domestic propaganda they made it legal this year
[02:11:57.160 --> 02:12:03.400]  but before that they use strafford for that which overall strafford promotes you know guns and some
[02:12:03.400 --> 02:12:08.520]  free freedom issues so at least they're not communist in their ideology but as the cia
[02:12:08.520 --> 02:12:12.840]  tentacle i'm not even saying that the worst thing out there uh but you know they do criticize me
[02:12:12.840 --> 02:12:18.040]  for no reason uh because i don't believe they're baloney i'm bin laden but dr pacinic joins us
[02:12:18.040 --> 02:12:21.880]  he was on sunday for just two segments and was just dropping bombshell after bombshell
[02:12:21.880 --> 02:12:26.440]  i want you to talk to us like we're five years old dr pacinic because whenever you're talking
[02:12:26.440 --> 02:12:31.080]  i can tell you're talking to the establishment and that's important to have that conduit but
[02:12:31.080 --> 02:12:35.000]  there are different groups in the establishment obviously so talk about the different power
[02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:39.080]  structures that are there the good the bad the other the different mafias that are there the
[02:12:39.080 --> 02:12:44.600]  different combines that are there and your well research view and then described in just how you
[02:12:44.600 --> 02:12:49.880]  see the battlefront the battle space will they pull a false flag to make obama look like an angel
[02:12:49.880 --> 02:12:55.160]  and pull his bacon because he's falling apart so fast uh what's going on with russia i know you're
[02:12:55.160 --> 02:13:00.760]  an expert on that and don't like the russkies uh and the whole ukraine situation and this gas
[02:13:00.760 --> 02:13:07.480]  pipeline all of it with dr steve pacinic right now uh and then we'll go to bill in thailand and
[02:13:07.480 --> 02:13:13.080]  everybody else that's holding rena and canada douglas in idaho daniel in colorado wane in texas
[02:13:13.080 --> 02:13:18.520]  all right doc there's my long uh hypomanic introduction to you you've got the floor now
[02:13:18.520 --> 02:13:23.080]  tell us please answer the question what are the real power structures who are the power players
[02:13:23.080 --> 02:13:28.760]  in your view and who are the good the bad and the ugly well the real power structure always goes
[02:13:28.760 --> 02:13:34.920]  but behind what stalin once said the power of the gun it's what determines the viability of
[02:13:34.920 --> 02:13:40.680]  the power structure it's pretty crude but it is very real and even in the republic and remember
[02:13:40.680 --> 02:13:45.480]  we are in a republic i want to congratulate everybody with the veteran but basically the power
[02:13:45.480 --> 02:13:52.120]  structure in america is what i said the military industrial complex as evidenced by the power
[02:13:52.120 --> 02:13:58.760]  first it's the military with its numerous generals admirals and all kinds of senior officials
[02:13:58.760 --> 02:14:04.520]  when we do not need now we are downsizing our military we should be downsizing but we're not
[02:14:04.520 --> 02:14:09.480]  in fact we have more generals and admirals than we had in world war two where george marshall the
[02:14:09.480 --> 02:14:16.440]  most brilliant law strategist created two wars two different arenas the pacific and and europe where
[02:14:16.440 --> 02:14:23.240]  we won two wars since that time as a comment about our military we have lost every major war
[02:14:23.240 --> 02:14:28.120]  as general boykin has said who was the head of special forces and what we've done i've worked
[02:14:28.120 --> 02:14:34.840]  with we have not won a battle since 1944 the battle of the bulge that's a very serious indictment of
[02:14:34.840 --> 02:14:40.680]  our military but at the same time we have a new breed of military leaders the likes of which we
[02:14:40.680 --> 02:14:47.320]  have not seen before many of them like teeth alexander general portray as uh many others
[02:14:47.320 --> 02:14:54.840]  at phd as well as multiple degrees in strategic analysis and in cyber war we're coming into a
[02:14:54.840 --> 02:15:02.120]  new era where the gun the missile and even the icbm and the b-52 and the old triad of power
[02:15:02.120 --> 02:15:07.160]  that we used to run from the white house under the nixon ford reagan administration
[02:15:07.160 --> 02:15:13.400]  the triad of the bombers the icbm the nuclear submarines the only one left is the nuclear
[02:15:13.400 --> 02:15:18.600]  submarine and that's been supplanted by really cyber war and the man who brought it to the
[02:15:18.600 --> 02:15:24.520]  forefront in the power structure was really quite formidable dr keith alexander a general
[02:15:24.520 --> 02:15:30.280]  keith alexander who's been correctly reprimanded for overreaching his own mandate but he's done
[02:15:30.280 --> 02:15:36.120]  that in the attempt to really understand how far the national security agents can reach now having
[02:15:36.120 --> 02:15:42.440]  said that the major power would probably within the national security agency 16 or 15 under
[02:15:42.440 --> 02:15:49.400]  intelligence groups including the civilian cia now i have been a fan of the old cia where you had
[02:15:49.400 --> 02:15:56.440]  people who came out of the os s men like paul redmond uh jim lily don greg and others who really
[02:15:56.440 --> 02:16:02.200]  came in because they wanted to be dedicated to america but unfortunately over the past 20 to 30
[02:16:02.200 --> 02:16:08.440]  years the cia a civilian organization became a paramilitary organization co-opted part of the
[02:16:08.440 --> 02:16:13.560]  military units through an office called the special operations low intensity conflict
[02:16:13.560 --> 02:16:19.160]  office or solik and took in special forces where they asked them to take off their uh
[02:16:19.160 --> 02:16:24.760]  their uh the ranks and basically put them in paramilitary organizations general denis
[02:16:24.760 --> 02:16:29.480]  flair and others like myself and other generals feel that this is no longer appropriate we need
[02:16:29.480 --> 02:16:34.200]  our special forces under total command of the military and isn't that a coup of the republic
[02:16:34.200 --> 02:16:40.680]  system that george washington set up uh in 1776 when he founded the army which then they immediately
[02:16:40.680 --> 02:16:46.360]  then go to the mercenaries and make them the new rock stars up front paying a bunch now they don't
[02:16:46.360 --> 02:16:53.320]  as much to suck everyone out of the old republic system into their new private army which can
[02:16:53.320 --> 02:16:59.720]  then be spun off uh to foreign corporations and you basically have a soft coup well that's correct
[02:16:59.720 --> 02:17:05.080]  what's happened in effect over the period since 9 11 the most famous stand down and the one that
[02:17:05.080 --> 02:17:12.120]  should receive kudos and i know alex is very uh very very uh private about it he really does
[02:17:12.120 --> 02:17:17.560]  deserve the kudos for broadcasting what was a significant message that this was a stand down
[02:17:17.560 --> 02:17:23.400]  in a false flag since that time we haven't had that we've had deception denial and distortion
[02:17:23.400 --> 02:17:28.760]  but the most important false flag we've had in the 21st century was the 9 11 one in america
[02:17:30.120 --> 02:17:34.840]  now what happened as a result of that is cheney who had never served in the military and refused
[02:17:34.840 --> 02:17:40.840]  to serve 11 times when he was drafted yet i and others who were drafted the first time went in
[02:17:40.840 --> 02:17:47.400]  this coward or chicken hawk cheney sent our boys into the hard car arms way in iraq and afghanistan
[02:17:47.400 --> 02:17:52.440]  knowing fully well that they were going into getting killed for no reason whatsoever so we've
[02:17:52.440 --> 02:17:59.320]  been in wars that we don't really need korea vietnam iraq afghanistan we've had a we've
[02:17:59.320 --> 02:18:05.480]  had a complex right so we've had a military industrial complex that purely was about profit
[02:18:05.480 --> 02:18:10.440]  even if it undermined the overall interest of the united states that sounds like killing the
[02:18:10.440 --> 02:18:16.440]  golden goose even if i was a sociopathic globalist making billions i would not want to undermine my
[02:18:16.440 --> 02:18:22.920]  main command base well you correct ballots the key issue now for america and why i'm very positive
[02:18:22.920 --> 02:18:29.160]  about america and even more positive about our military but american citizens have to put a break
[02:18:29.160 --> 02:18:34.680]  on what's called the military industrial complex generalizing how it was clearly a formidable leader
[02:18:34.680 --> 02:18:40.920]  but he was also formidable americans who was a very down-to-earth individual who said look
[02:18:40.920 --> 02:18:47.080]  if we don't watch our military industrial complex we will erode the basis of the republic what is
[02:18:47.080 --> 02:18:52.520]  happening now and why we have to be careful is that the republic has turned into an empire
[02:18:52.520 --> 02:19:00.600]  the empire is out of control with 783 bases in 223 countries we are fighting no one and actually
[02:19:00.600 --> 02:19:06.680]  we have a navy that should be denying access to the chinese that's probably the legitimate national
[02:19:06.680 --> 02:19:12.280]  security concern we have in south china which is being negotiated now other than that we have no
[02:19:12.280 --> 02:19:18.360]  real interest in other countries isis is not a major concern for us israel is not a major concern
[02:19:18.360 --> 02:19:24.680]  for us the middle east is not a major concern we are a formal net exporter of oil and gas
[02:19:24.680 --> 02:19:30.840]  at the result of that we have because of our entrepreneurial skills and ingenuity we have
[02:19:30.840 --> 02:19:37.880]  been a net exporter of oil and now gas we do not need saudi arabia we do not need any middle east
[02:19:37.880 --> 02:19:44.440]  and country to supply oil and gas and in turn they cannot manipulate the price that we decide
[02:19:44.440 --> 02:19:51.000]  to lower and we keep lowering the price of gas and oil down from 100 brent oil to 80 brent oil
[02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:56.280]  and probably we'll bring it down to what the canadian said which is $50 a barrel of brent oil
[02:19:56.280 --> 02:20:01.160]  my suspicion is we will have the keystone pipeline going all the way from alberta
[02:20:01.160 --> 02:20:07.480]  down to texas and the reason for that is because canada needs to export its shale gas oil through
[02:20:07.480 --> 02:20:13.240]  that pipeline and we have been a very good partner and why would george soros be trying to block that
[02:20:13.240 --> 02:20:21.000]  key pipeline is he uh how how in bed is he with the chinese uh obama is not very well in bed with
[02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:26.920]  the chinese i have to give him credit the chinese are basically deciding two things one they're
[02:20:26.920 --> 02:20:32.440]  putting into position and they think to all of their neighbors primarily vietnam which by the way
[02:20:32.440 --> 02:20:38.360]  after 30 is being our strongest ally in southeast asia we are going to be parking our our military
[02:20:38.360 --> 02:20:44.040]  in vietnam we officially don't have bases there because we don't want to and uh for those that
[02:20:44.040 --> 02:20:48.200]  don't know china's been attacking vietnam and people think it's weird that we're teamed up with
[02:20:48.200 --> 02:20:53.560]  vietnam now they've been fighting the chinese for 500 years and that's why they didn't want us there
[02:20:53.560 --> 02:20:57.480]  it was always stupid to go there is anybody that tries to go there they fight them and it's just
[02:20:57.480 --> 02:21:03.160]  how bizarre now that you're about to you know have these and why is china making statements like
[02:21:03.160 --> 02:21:07.720]  we may take philippine islands we may take japanese islands why are they escalating the
[02:21:07.720 --> 02:21:13.400]  rhetoric and what does this gas deal mean with putin and then let's segue into russia okay the
[02:21:13.400 --> 02:21:18.520]  issue why china is talking as loudly as they are they have it for internal consumption not for
[02:21:18.520 --> 02:21:25.560]  external china right now is not capable of landing a an effective fleet against our own fleet we had
[02:21:25.560 --> 02:21:30.520]  an effect our sink pack of commandant chief of the pacific has denied access through the most
[02:21:30.520 --> 02:21:35.400]  important straits of water straits which is the straits of malacca where trade goes through and
[02:21:35.400 --> 02:21:41.080]  80 percent of the trade is off protecting chinese boats so if you really want to look at the paradox
[02:21:41.080 --> 02:21:47.560]  of the situation our navy protects chinese boats to do free trade into southeast asia the second
[02:21:47.560 --> 02:21:52.680]  part is vietnam is the only country that has defeated five countries including france japan
[02:21:53.560 --> 02:21:59.080]  china twice in the united states and they have no animosity to us because they realize that we came
[02:21:59.080 --> 02:22:05.320]  in there not as exploiters or as colonialists that basically is that an opportunity and we left as
[02:22:05.320 --> 02:22:11.080]  opposed to the french whom they really hate now what happened to china is putin because we are
[02:22:11.080 --> 02:22:17.080]  decreasing the price of oil and effectively we are in an economic war let this be understood this
[02:22:17.080 --> 02:22:22.920]  is not by chance nor was gorbachev correct about saying this is a new cold war this is not a new
[02:22:22.920 --> 02:22:29.880]  cold war gorbachev knows that he was taken down because we were effective in both the push administration
[02:22:29.880 --> 02:22:35.720]  and the reagan administration and i must give credit to push senior who was exemplary in really
[02:22:35.720 --> 02:22:41.400]  running the operations against the soviet union let me repeat it again reagan gets proper credit
[02:22:41.400 --> 02:22:46.200]  but the person who does not get proper credit and should be lauded for what was done in the
[02:22:46.200 --> 02:22:54.280]  soviet union and against the soviet is george hw bush 41 and james bay per section of state
[02:22:54.280 --> 02:23:00.440]  these are two exceedingly modest men from texas who have never asserted their rightful place in
[02:23:00.440 --> 02:23:05.480]  the history of the takedown of the soviet union they were the implementers they were the ones who
[02:23:05.480 --> 02:23:11.480]  provided the overall oversight over my strategy and tactics that would develop the rain corporation
[02:23:11.480 --> 02:23:16.680]  then cooperated by the cia and the military intelligence and we effectively took down the
[02:23:16.680 --> 02:23:21.960]  soviet union against their economic variables their military variables and their religious
[02:23:21.960 --> 02:23:28.120]  never underestimate that we are a christian society to deal christian society with hope john
[02:23:28.120 --> 02:23:34.120]  was very effective at bringing together one million polish catholics on the border of russia
[02:23:34.120 --> 02:23:40.120]  to basically say religion is not dead and we will stimulate that religion of brief orthodox or
[02:23:40.120 --> 02:23:45.240]  russian orthodox in the soviet union and that was the beginning of the end of the soviet union
[02:23:45.240 --> 02:23:49.880]  so contrary to a gorbachev would like to believe or anybody else would like to believe
[02:23:49.880 --> 02:23:56.520]  this was really a a group after on behalf of the cia the military intelligence bush senior
[02:23:57.080 --> 02:24:04.600]  reagan and baker who really carried through an immense amount of of heavy-duty work with
[02:24:04.600 --> 02:24:12.680]  a multiple coordinates involved in the economic military to be uh even music we used to show
[02:24:12.680 --> 02:24:17.000]  that we could break up the apparatchiks which we used to rock and roll believe it or not and
[02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:23.000]  religion so this is not we're not entering a new code what's happening is because we are a
[02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:28.120]  formidable country and i think everybody should recognize it and enjoy it for this moment we
[02:24:28.120 --> 02:24:34.440]  have created envy envy in this world means that the russian historically have never been able to
[02:24:34.440 --> 02:24:40.280]  equal what we have done despite the fact that we have taken down twice the repressive regime
[02:24:40.280 --> 02:24:46.680]  and probably putin will leave within time because he can no longer manage an economic system that's
[02:24:46.680 --> 02:24:50.920]  based on the market economy sure doc doc doc let's shift gears for a moment
[02:24:52.040 --> 02:24:58.120]  after you finish on russia get into though the awakening the moving back to the states
[02:24:58.760 --> 02:25:05.080]  the liberty movement what you think is positive because i see a lot of positive stuff but the
[02:25:05.080 --> 02:25:10.360]  corporate globalist interests that are using the united states like it's evil frankenstein
[02:25:10.360 --> 02:25:15.480]  they're not giving up they're moving forward i mean i see them pulling false flags i see them doing
[02:25:15.480 --> 02:25:22.440]  economic scams uh but they're also afraid to do big false flags now because they know we're aware
[02:25:22.440 --> 02:25:27.480]  of the tricks i'm going to talk about that political landscape as well sure the american
[02:25:27.480 --> 02:25:33.240]  political landscape thanks to you and others quite frankly be what we will call the conspiracy
[02:25:33.240 --> 02:25:38.920]  although alternative media has really become the mainstay we took that name and i thank alex and
[02:25:38.920 --> 02:25:44.680]  others who were involved and became the mainstay because what in fact happened is we devolved the
[02:25:44.680 --> 02:25:50.280]  power all the way from the white house down to the regional governors and then the commission
[02:25:50.280 --> 02:25:56.040]  and as a result of the tea party movement which did have an impetus effect and eventually had
[02:25:56.040 --> 02:26:03.480]  lost its usage it basically stimulated a lot of the grassroots initiatives and the basic
[02:26:03.480 --> 02:26:08.760]  underlying americanism within our people that is we understood that we were being
[02:26:08.760 --> 02:26:13.880]  good when we understood what we were being lied to we understood that that obama didn't belong
[02:26:13.880 --> 02:26:18.680]  there we understood that bush lied to us we understood that clinton was immoral so what
[02:26:18.680 --> 02:26:24.600]  happened in return our reactions come out thanks to people like you we can articulate those feelings
[02:26:24.600 --> 02:26:30.920]  and basically state the positions we said no more we don't want this we don't want the bushes we
[02:26:30.920 --> 02:26:35.960]  don't want the clinton as barbara bush said no more bushes in the white house she's correct
[02:26:35.960 --> 02:26:40.600]  and i would add no more clintons in the white house so we are beginning to evolve into new
[02:26:40.600 --> 02:26:46.360]  political entity which has greater control at the grassroots level where the corporations are not
[02:26:46.360 --> 02:26:51.080]  that effective that's why they have gone overseas but what happened when they went overseas is they
[02:26:51.080 --> 02:26:57.480]  forgot that the american worker is the most efficient fast entrepreneurial worker in the world
[02:26:57.480 --> 02:27:02.440]  when he went to china the corporation they came back with very poor products when they went to
[02:27:02.440 --> 02:27:09.400]  india they came back with medicines that were highly diluted by other products so the american
[02:27:09.400 --> 02:27:15.160]  corporation suddenly said wait a minute europe is going into devaluation and deflation china's
[02:27:15.160 --> 02:27:20.680]  heading into deflation and a problem with their environment we're coming back to the united states
[02:27:20.680 --> 02:27:27.800]  so what's happened is the corporation are economic cowards what do i mean companies like fiser take
[02:27:27.800 --> 02:27:33.880]  what's called an adverse inversion technique they basically buy out a company like astrosanica
[02:27:33.880 --> 02:27:38.680]  which is not a very effective pharmaceutical company because of the tax advantage and without
[02:27:38.680 --> 02:27:45.000]  leaving their own base they go from a 35 percent tax rate down to a 15 percent tax rate even though
[02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:50.920]  they've done nothing more than shift paperwork in new york that has to change the american public
[02:27:50.920 --> 02:27:56.760]  is basically subsidizing big corporation and big farmer which doesn't deserve it despite what they
[02:27:56.760 --> 02:28:01.800]  say to you and they say to me as a physician they have not developed all these medications
[02:28:01.800 --> 02:28:08.440]  on the basis of fda research and on the basis of the nih they developed it on the basis of having
[02:28:08.440 --> 02:28:14.840]  side effects and their own greed so what i'm saying the american public is a very effective
[02:28:14.840 --> 02:28:20.440]  instrument for brooking these big industries for being able to stop them for saying okay that's
[02:28:20.440 --> 02:28:26.200]  enough we may not always agree with obama yet nevertheless the economic warfare is effective
[02:28:26.200 --> 02:28:32.360]  against the soviet union and i mean against russia and putin is is crying out he needs help
[02:28:32.360 --> 02:28:37.160]  the chinese need help now because we're going to fast track that trade and that means a lot more
[02:28:37.160 --> 02:28:43.720]  for the political power base in the united states we are now the only people that have increased
[02:28:43.720 --> 02:28:49.880]  in our growth development we've had a decrease in unemployment and really in relation to europe
[02:28:49.880 --> 02:28:55.320]  and china and the world we're doing much better even though there's the isis and ebola we're able
[02:28:55.320 --> 02:29:01.080]  to transfer that we're able to transport beyond that and get back into our work what about where
[02:29:01.080 --> 02:29:08.040]  the beauty ahead i'm sorry well we're just going to break your okay we're going to break when we
[02:29:08.040 --> 02:29:10.920]  come back and we need to finish up and we're going to have some phone calls we're also going to talk
[02:29:10.920 --> 02:29:15.560]  about your medical company which we've never talked about but before we go there i want to
[02:29:15.560 --> 02:29:23.880]  specifically though get into what i call this fascist leftist ideology i don't even call it
[02:29:23.880 --> 02:29:31.800]  socialist where they get off on trying to destroy the family messing with men messing with women the
[02:29:31.800 --> 02:29:38.600]  attempt to screw up families and to screw up the society this is what you do to a foreign enemy
[02:29:38.600 --> 02:29:44.520]  and i would call that an immoral tactic why are they using those type of scyops to degenerate
[02:29:44.520 --> 02:29:51.160]  society here why is the political class doing that we'll talk to the doctor the empires on the run

[02:35:34.200 --> 02:35:39.800]  or they put out crud or they put out synthetic stuff because they want to use marketing to do it

[02:36:27.080 --> 02:36:33.480]  about your line of nutraceutical uh supplements because i mean i know that it's a very very popular
[02:36:33.480 --> 02:36:37.960]  people have gotten great results with it and i'm interested maybe you can work with us and help us
[02:36:37.960 --> 02:36:44.280]  formulate something dr pacinic well the pleasure let me first state that alex uh the question you
[02:36:44.280 --> 02:36:50.600]  asked me was about the nature of the left wing distorting the value of the america oh yeah i mean
[02:36:50.600 --> 02:36:55.000]  why do they come out and brag yes obama cares meant to bankrupt you yeah the reason is very simple
[02:36:55.000 --> 02:37:00.280]  the reason is we're basically a christian country what happens in the christian country is not that
[02:37:00.280 --> 02:37:06.200]  everyone is in a religion they can be a fear but what the statement of christianity is about is
[02:37:06.200 --> 02:37:12.280]  the statement of certain values that hold true to the very roots of what our country was based on
[02:37:12.280 --> 02:37:17.880]  which is the family is a central value of the organization the community the community is
[02:37:17.880 --> 02:37:24.760]  central element of the uh state and the county and the states are central element of the republic
[02:37:24.760 --> 02:37:31.560]  so when you have these values you learn what is appropriate what is not appropriate certain things
[02:37:31.560 --> 02:37:37.480]  break the norm when you have gay marriage you have different types of relationships that may be within
[02:37:37.480 --> 02:37:43.720]  the christian shield that's up to the theologians to decide that but the basic point that there may
[02:37:43.720 --> 02:37:49.960]  be a a war of values of class structures that's inherent to the republic we have always had
[02:37:49.960 --> 02:37:55.960]  internal wars between one ideology and another ideology i have always had faith that the american
[02:37:55.960 --> 02:38:01.640]  public will reaffirm its basic belief and that we're a Judea christian country which
[02:38:01.640 --> 02:38:07.640]  arises on values of both religion and that doesn't mean that you can't be an atheist it can be as
[02:38:07.640 --> 02:38:13.800]  long as you understand the precepts and the conduct of behavior that those religions mandate in
[02:38:13.800 --> 02:38:17.160]  other words treat others as you would treat yourself the golden rule well that's what i'm
[02:38:17.160 --> 02:38:24.440]  getting at is it's very soviet style but also fascist the way they persecute people and want
[02:38:24.440 --> 02:38:29.880]  to arrest preachers that read out of the bible in houston they want to subpoena them and want to
[02:38:29.880 --> 02:38:35.880]  make you talk away and adopt their language that's not liberal thomas jefferson was a liberal
[02:38:35.880 --> 02:38:42.120]  these people are just sickening autocratic control freaks engaged in what i'd call
[02:38:42.120 --> 02:38:48.840]  bullying attempts at cultural overwrites well the point here is where there is always
[02:38:48.840 --> 02:38:54.840]  strife there's always an opportunity for america this is where we have the opportunity to fight that
[02:38:54.840 --> 02:39:00.360]  be it on the right or the left if somebody tried to suppress a minister who wants to read from the
[02:39:00.360 --> 02:39:05.880]  bible or whatever time then he has the right to assert his right and to fight for that right
[02:39:05.880 --> 02:39:11.560]  within the doctrines of the american constitution and our declaration of independence those are the
[02:39:11.560 --> 02:39:17.240]  mandates that are given to us that's why the federal government is becoming weaker and weaker
[02:39:17.240 --> 02:39:22.760]  and what's happening is now judges and judicial courts are beginning to make mandates that have
[02:39:22.760 --> 02:39:28.760]  no relevance to everyday living where the robert says that the country that a company is a person
[02:39:28.760 --> 02:39:34.680]  is absolutely ridiculous and probably will be changed but in turn that has affected the way
[02:39:34.680 --> 02:39:39.880]  we have voted and that's affected the way the candidates have come forth but my face in the
[02:39:39.880 --> 02:39:46.040]  american public is that it really will revolve around things that are anti fascists anti suppression
[02:39:46.040 --> 02:39:52.040]  anti repression simply because that's the way we grew up the problems for the most of the world
[02:39:52.040 --> 02:39:58.280]  is that they cannot mirror the notion of the individuality of the america be it your black
[02:39:58.280 --> 02:40:03.240]  white green yellow or red that's why people want to come to this country it will always remain that
[02:40:03.240 --> 02:40:08.680]  way we will always struggle within sure why would our elites and the republicans working with them
[02:40:08.680 --> 02:40:13.880]  try to fundamentally dumb people down and screw the country up that is such a premeditated
[02:40:13.880 --> 02:40:20.440]  vandalism of the culture it just it repudiates the people running things and shows that they're
[02:40:20.440 --> 02:40:26.600]  the lowest form of scum well if you have nothing else to do you run for congress and ascend it
[02:40:26.600 --> 02:40:31.480]  most people that are treated who are a professional politician really have never started their own
[02:40:31.480 --> 02:40:36.440]  business have never had day-to-day concerns like you and i where we have to meet a payroll we have
[02:40:36.440 --> 02:40:42.680]  to meet financial obligations most of them are very entitled very lazy and very scared to go
[02:40:42.680 --> 02:40:49.240]  out into the real world to find work and to put themselves up against the reality of uncertainty
[02:40:49.240 --> 02:40:54.760]  and that's really what we've had in leaders whether it's clinton bush jr or obama not one of them
[02:40:54.760 --> 02:40:59.800]  has had a job other than being a professional politician which by definition means he's never
[02:40:59.800 --> 02:41:05.720]  had a job so what we have to look for now is somebody who's really been in the executive
[02:41:05.720 --> 02:41:12.440]  branch or the management branch of any company or state yeah why is it always lawyers why don't we
[02:41:12.440 --> 02:41:19.000]  have like you know corporate people or business people or or medical doctors or something like
[02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:24.680]  instead it's always lawyers who just believe they can argue this any side of anything and so there's
[02:41:24.680 --> 02:41:31.000]  nothing there there's no core value and so they're threatened by anybody who has values of any type
[02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:37.880]  they just want us to be these these programmable bots well the lawyers are basically creating
[02:41:37.880 --> 02:41:43.240]  their own game you play within the law you pray within a kabuki that's corrupt and distorted
[02:41:43.240 --> 02:41:48.360]  if you play in medicine it's an open-ended game that has its own rules but now you got rand paul
[02:41:48.920 --> 02:41:53.560]  you have a lot of doctors now in congress you're going to have cpas at the local level here at
[02:41:53.560 --> 02:41:59.960]  the commissioner level and we need more managers literally at jobs and now we have to have another
[02:41:59.960 --> 02:42:07.240]  da who's come out of proctor and gamble we're going to have businessmen running forth i mean uh you know
[02:42:07.240 --> 02:42:12.360]  romney was an example of the business man john huntsman was an example of the business man america
[02:42:12.360 --> 02:42:19.240]  turned them down for a man who had no history and no practical application so the question becomes
[02:42:19.240 --> 02:42:24.840]  are we going to repeat this again are we going to vote in somebody who's singular because of their
[02:42:24.840 --> 02:42:30.680]  color or their gender or are we going to bring in somebody who understands finances management
[02:42:30.680 --> 02:42:36.840]  and implementation that's the decision america now because you've come on over the years for 14 years
[02:42:36.840 --> 02:42:41.960]  or 13 years and never plugged anything i mean i do find your company interesting tell us tell us
[02:42:41.960 --> 02:42:47.080]  the name of it we'll put the website up on screen tell us about your your nutrition when i was in
[02:42:47.080 --> 02:42:53.800]  montana seven eight years ago i developed a company with a brilliant uh uh natural gas named john
[02:42:53.800 --> 02:43:00.920]  new steed and we developed two key products one was mk4 or osteo k which was used for osteoporosis
[02:43:00.920 --> 02:43:06.200]  we didn't initiate that product we took it in from japan that we're used for 30 years for the
[02:43:06.760 --> 02:43:14.120]  for the treatment of osteoporosis and the prevention of fractures we don't worry about the uh bone
[02:43:14.120 --> 02:43:18.440]  density as much as we worry about decretion fractures and we found that we can decrete
[02:43:18.440 --> 02:43:24.440]  fractures significantly at the same time we've gotten initial approval by the fda for the treatment
[02:43:24.440 --> 02:43:30.840]  of acute myocytic leukemia and myocytoplastic uh syndrome which are very important issues and
[02:43:30.840 --> 02:43:35.720]  people all over the world have now been buying this up in the hundreds and thousands and and as i
[02:43:35.720 --> 02:43:41.320]  said to alex you know i really don't know what's the company because it works by itself it's word
[02:43:41.320 --> 02:43:47.880]  of mouth and the other products might afford which is amazing a mitochondrial section and it
[02:43:47.880 --> 02:43:52.920]  proves the memory and the last product we have is the multiple vitamins which is the requirement
[02:43:52.920 --> 02:43:58.920]  of four vitamins minimum per day which was uh formulated by dr john new steed and when you
[02:43:58.920 --> 02:44:04.680]  deal with nbi health you will be dealing with my partner john new steed who's a brilliant brilliant
[02:44:04.680 --> 02:44:10.440]  uh pharmacist and a brilliant botanist and this company's been very successful because of word
[02:44:10.440 --> 02:44:15.000]  of mouth and because the products do work and we don't claim that we discovered the initial
[02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:20.600]  product we claim that reformulated is made of pure and potent which means that very rare in
[02:44:20.600 --> 02:44:27.800]  america they have products which are literally not diluted with other uh a brand other low quality
[02:44:27.800 --> 02:44:33.480]  products we guarantee the highest quality made in the united states and its performance again well
[02:44:33.480 --> 02:44:37.240]  i'm very interested in it because i look at the formulations they're amazing and i know how
[02:44:37.240 --> 02:44:43.080]  successful it is in just eight years um and i mean we follow it in fours life.com the very
[02:44:43.080 --> 02:44:47.960]  same ideas the very same principles and it is all about word of mouth and that's why being
[02:44:47.960 --> 02:44:53.400]  moral is a win-win-win for the customers for yourself for everybody and that's the only karma
[02:44:53.400 --> 02:44:59.720]  or mojo reput you so that i want uh is uh you know serious high quality and there's all these
[02:44:59.720 --> 02:45:04.920]  attempts to suppress these type of things uh but i see that being defeated as well so the moral
[02:45:04.920 --> 02:45:09.560]  of the story is there's not just evil in this world there's good as well now listen i want to get
[02:45:09.560 --> 02:45:15.320]  the calls i don't want to hog everybody here renee david wane douglas daniel uh who's been holding
[02:45:15.320 --> 02:45:25.400]  the longest here john reena in canada okay reena in canada the guy in tailand had to hang up uh
[02:45:25.400 --> 02:45:30.680]  okay reena in canada go ahead you're on the air with dr pacenic okay you can hear me yes i can
[02:45:30.680 --> 02:45:39.240]  ma'am yeah okay so um i just i kind of have a small uh testimonial about vaccines and then i'm just
[02:45:39.880 --> 02:45:46.280]  wondering uh how they can get away with this stuff um two years ago when my son was two and
[02:45:46.280 --> 02:45:52.680]  half he was given a vaccine and then the next day when he got out of the bath his leg started
[02:45:52.680 --> 02:46:00.120]  wobbling and he just like fell over and i 20 minutes later he was really hot i ended up having
[02:46:00.120 --> 02:46:06.120]  to call 911 while i was waiting his lips turned blue it was like the scariest day of my life
[02:46:06.120 --> 02:46:11.000]  we've got to the hospital they did all kinds of tests they couldn't find anything wrong with him
[02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:15.960]  and then i started researching vaccines and i found out it says right in the inserts that they
[02:46:15.960 --> 02:46:21.640]  caused seizures and i'm just wondering how they could be constantly injuring well almost everyone
[02:46:21.640 --> 02:46:26.920]  i know that's ill got a vaccine adulter child they get gion beret narcolepsy they can't drive
[02:46:26.920 --> 02:46:32.920]  cars anymore uh they get epilepsy from it they get cancer from it uh people's kids are fine
[02:46:32.920 --> 02:46:37.720]  their brain damage with blood coming out their nose the next day i mean it is a curse and again
[02:46:37.720 --> 02:46:43.080]  i'm not saying vaccines aren't a real technology it's just that whatever's going into them whatever's
[02:46:43.080 --> 02:46:49.960]  happening i wouldn't take a vaccine uh if my life depended on it now i don't know dr pacenic's
[02:46:49.960 --> 02:46:57.240]  view on this dr pacenic your view on immunization well on a collective level we need to immunize
[02:46:57.240 --> 02:47:01.880]  our children otherwise we're going to have an outbreak of what i've seen when i grew up which
[02:47:01.880 --> 02:47:10.280]  is polio measles it is not a very good uh epidemic to have on the other hand you do have concerns
[02:47:10.280 --> 02:47:16.280]  side effects so you really have to study and find out how much thermosol and how much mercury there
[02:47:16.280 --> 02:47:21.240]  is in the vaccine and whether there's a variation of it well that's the thing though they lie and say
[02:47:21.240 --> 02:47:26.280]  see you're honest like doctors always were and said yeah this cost benefit now they just say hey
[02:47:26.280 --> 02:47:31.720]  there's no side effects trust us take it and when you get hurt they try to deny it uh here's an example
[02:47:31.720 --> 02:47:35.960]  they never said give pregnant women vaccines until six years ago now they say give them extra
[02:47:36.520 --> 02:47:39.800]  and now i've talked to medical doctors on there they say that's crazy what do you say
[02:47:41.080 --> 02:47:45.960]  well i haven't given it you know i've just given vaccines to myself and my family unfortunately
[02:47:45.960 --> 02:47:52.040]  nothing has happened but i can't get into the details of vaccines i've not been uh privy to all
[02:47:52.040 --> 02:47:58.120]  the studies but i do know from an epidemiological point of view that we do have to contain certain
[02:47:58.120 --> 02:48:06.440]  problems once flu which spanish flu has killed over 20 million people in 1990 we have some control
[02:48:06.440 --> 02:48:11.400]  over that now yeah i think the issue is the vaccine companies have been given protections
[02:48:11.400 --> 02:48:16.120]  where they can't get sued basically remember port and down and bio port and the troops getting
[02:48:16.120 --> 02:48:21.880]  hurt with bad vaccines i think the issue is they're allowed to put out crap doc well that that's the
[02:48:21.880 --> 02:48:28.120]  problem of the fda the fda has to monitor this more effectively can we monitor more effectively yes
[02:48:28.120 --> 02:48:33.960]  will i speak on behalf of the fda no i think margaret hamberger has to and uh you know address
[02:48:33.960 --> 02:48:38.840]  these issues as to where the vaccine has to be improved well that lady already hung up but i
[02:48:38.840 --> 02:48:43.960]  wanted to hear from her her son got better we're so sorry ma'am look it's it's causing effect take
[02:48:43.960 --> 02:48:47.960]  the shot have the convulsion and it's an autoimmune response in the brain according to medical doctors
[02:48:48.520 --> 02:48:52.520]  and and i get the fact i wish vaccines were safe and effective i would take them
[02:48:52.520 --> 02:48:57.400]  it's just that the damage i believe is starting to outweigh what they claim the good is doc uh
[02:48:57.400 --> 02:49:00.360]  let's talk to daniel in colorado you're on the air with dr pacenic
[02:49:00.360 --> 02:49:09.560]  hello alex thank you for taking my call um i'm calling from durango colorado and here in the
[02:49:09.560 --> 02:49:18.680]  local paper of the durango herald they put out an article stating drone steak to the sky and
[02:49:18.680 --> 02:49:25.400]  how they're selling this is how it will be beneficial for wildfires how they can locate
[02:49:25.400 --> 02:49:31.640]  the hot spots and go in and pick them out um you know we see the police state forming
[02:49:32.440 --> 02:49:38.760]  we see marshal along the horizon how do you what are your thoughts on drones that's a good
[02:49:38.760 --> 02:49:42.520]  point whenever we showed about five years ago or four years ago that they're planning to use
[02:49:42.520 --> 02:49:47.080]  drones and surveil farmers and harass people they had the media say it wasn't true now they're
[02:49:47.080 --> 02:49:51.880]  launching them dr pacenic what is your concern on drones the police state you name it because
[02:49:51.880 --> 02:49:57.080]  there isn't awakening happening but the system tends to you know try to set up an oppression system
[02:49:57.960 --> 02:50:03.640]  well what's happening is the more the police state tries to set up an oppressive system the
[02:50:03.640 --> 02:50:09.400]  more it becomes in other words the bigger it becomes in some way the american public should
[02:50:09.400 --> 02:50:15.480]  be grateful it really doesn't function as size increases it becomes more ineffectual i'll give
[02:50:15.480 --> 02:50:21.240]  you an example the day 20 30 years ago they may have collected the national security agency
[02:50:21.240 --> 02:50:26.200]  one million bits of information in a minute so they might have been able to monitor now
[02:50:26.200 --> 02:50:31.800]  they're collecting billions of bits of information which has no relevancy to anything with the issue
[02:50:31.800 --> 02:50:37.560]  of drones it's a fascinating phenomenon because now you can buy a drone for 300 dollars and people
[02:50:37.560 --> 02:50:43.400]  can actually have their own drones taking pictures so i think it's a new era i think it's
[02:50:43.400 --> 02:50:47.880]  equally uh i tell you what stay there stay there i want to come back and have you finish up
[02:50:47.880 --> 02:50:54.600]  out of prachetic i had a drone fly into my property up to my house through the window

[02:54:32.680 --> 02:54:37.880]  the question and i want to be on your show and look at this honor to have you wane in texas
[02:54:37.880 --> 02:54:43.080]  you're on the air go ahead uh yeah i like to want to share something real quick and then i got a
[02:54:43.080 --> 02:54:50.280]  question uh i've seen some things out here 70 miles from your location um i've seen two
[02:54:50.280 --> 02:54:56.600]  spacecraft out here man but i just three days ago i saw what looked like a b 52 silver
[02:54:57.160 --> 02:55:06.840]  fuselage flying over me and what fell out of the sky was like a giant sperm i mean it was odd
[02:55:06.840 --> 02:55:13.640]  but it had a tail like a web uh like a spider web almost it i'm seeing things out here that are
[02:55:13.640 --> 02:55:21.160]  unbelievable so i believe they have technology beyond our understanding uh my question for
[02:55:21.160 --> 02:55:26.920]  i'll tell you you saw what dropping giant sperm out of this guy well these things had like an
[02:55:26.920 --> 02:55:33.800]  egg sack on one end and a tail that came off of it i mean it looked like a huge sperm but uh it
[02:55:33.800 --> 02:55:41.080]  was odd i wish i'd got pictures sounds like some kind of midair refueling deal uh very very strange
[02:55:41.080 --> 02:55:47.480]  uh what was your question for dr pacinic well but i'm concerned about the psychology that we
[02:55:47.480 --> 02:55:52.760]  can't get beyond between the believers and the and the non-believers of what's going on here
[02:55:52.760 --> 02:55:59.400]  and does this relate to revelation and that some men's minds are seared the great delusion
[02:55:59.400 --> 02:56:04.840]  yeah given a great delusion let me ask pacinic that then in the time thank you caller
[02:56:04.840 --> 02:56:11.080]  there's some video that i'd like to see it um dr pacinic how do you get people who have
[02:56:11.080 --> 02:56:15.560]  cognitive dissonance that are in denial to wake up and admit this stuff's going on
[02:56:16.920 --> 02:56:23.320]  well the problem well it takes an incident and it takes a shock for them to suddenly realize
[02:56:23.320 --> 02:56:27.800]  that there's one thing they believe and then the phenomenon is not according to their belief
[02:56:27.800 --> 02:56:34.440]  like 9 11 everybody felt oh it's not possible because it takes too many people to be in a conspiracy
[02:56:34.440 --> 02:56:38.920]  and we don't do that the american government doesn't do that then finally and alex jones
[02:56:38.920 --> 02:56:43.960]  come forth or dr pacinic and then what happened is engineers and architects from all over the
[02:56:43.960 --> 02:56:50.680]  united states hundreds of them said look the uh the fact that uh building 40 stories high comes
[02:56:50.680 --> 02:56:55.800]  down in 10 seconds it's not possible and this is what happened and then eventually that cognitive
[02:56:55.800 --> 02:57:01.240]  dissonance of non-belief with the phenomenon of how you destroy a building and the fact
[02:57:01.240 --> 02:57:06.280]  that a third building was blown up without any effect that breaks the cognitive dissonance
[02:57:06.280 --> 02:57:12.760]  that's right people begin to say oh my god you know our country does go against us and therefore we
[02:57:12.760 --> 02:57:19.160]  must protect us and that's why you and i are here to basically attempt to break that now but it takes
[02:57:19.160 --> 02:57:25.240]  time david louisiana you're on the air go ahead hey this is david with the null report i got the
[02:57:25.240 --> 02:57:30.440]  interview john mccain about ben gazi and i got a job from the staff yeah i got to uh speak to an
[02:57:30.440 --> 02:57:37.320]  establishment establishment uh republican uh over the uh one night as a congressional victory party
[02:57:37.320 --> 02:57:42.520]  and i was picking his brains about a lot of topics and he said one of them was russia and he said
[02:57:42.520 --> 02:57:47.320]  that we should go in and kill every single one of the rebels in the uh donetsk region the first
[02:57:47.320 --> 02:57:53.160]  question and mr pacinic is do you think we should cut off the uh russian pipeline in that region
[02:57:53.160 --> 02:57:58.360]  and the second one is uh we always associate communism with democrats do you believe that
[02:57:58.360 --> 02:58:05.960]  there are fascists in the establishment republican party or are they just crony capitalist well i think
[02:58:05.960 --> 02:58:11.720]  that two good questions number one we don't have to do anything physically we're doing it already
[02:58:11.720 --> 02:58:18.520]  psychologically and economically when you drop the price of oil below 90 uh the dollars for barrel
[02:58:18.520 --> 02:58:24.440]  that's the first uh red line for him and the second red line is that the kremlin we know
[02:58:25.320 --> 02:58:30.520]  is bearing for uh a economy and not an affected economy i'll tell you what you five more minutes
[02:58:30.520 --> 02:58:34.920]  stock i want you to be able to finish this thought we'll talk to douglas and if you know we don't
[02:58:34.920 --> 02:58:40.280]  need to go and they were basically dropping the whole economy of russia by just lowering the price
[02:58:40.280 --> 02:58:45.000]  of oil but is that moral what did they do to us i'm gonna come back and ask you that straight ahead
[02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:52.200]  70 seconds we're back folks and for wars dot com when you're out on the road the last place you

[03:00:05.240 --> 03:00:18.520]  fix bayonets we are now entering overdrive with your host alex jones broadcasting live
[03:00:18.520 --> 03:00:23.960]  from the front lines if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[03:00:24.760 --> 03:00:28.200]  by the way there's a story here because i'm getting the emails all over the country
[03:00:28.200 --> 03:00:35.880]  where cable systems are dropping cnn including time warner cable systems and pacenic was just
[03:00:35.880 --> 03:00:39.880]  telling me that during the break dr pacenic i didn't know that but we're getting these emails
[03:00:39.880 --> 03:00:46.200]  i mean that i guess in his area of the country it happened to two years ago i said cnn is dead
[03:00:46.200 --> 03:00:51.320]  almost two years ago last january it'll be two years this january and that just shows how they're
[03:00:51.320 --> 03:00:56.920]  collapsing dish network just dropped them doc what does that signify so you're saying you have
[03:00:56.920 --> 03:01:03.320]  time warner cable and cnn's not on it no no actually you were very uh prophetic because
[03:01:03.320 --> 03:01:09.960]  when you said it last week i was about to add well our windstream uh company which is basically
[03:01:09.960 --> 03:01:16.040]  providing us with cnn and other cable literally dropped cnn and without any excuse without any
[03:01:16.040 --> 03:01:21.240]  apologies what it says it doesn't have an audience it never will have the kind of audience that you
[03:01:21.240 --> 03:01:27.560]  have it doesn't it doesn't manage to go into the millions it really is just ablam the repetition
[03:01:27.560 --> 03:01:31.960]  and people are not watching and by the way you know what we're getting i haven't launched it yet
[03:01:31.960 --> 03:01:34.280]  because i've been so busy with the satellites and a few other things but it's going to happen
[03:01:34.280 --> 03:01:40.040]  soon the next few months we have cable systems and broadcast tv beating down our doors wanting
[03:01:40.040 --> 03:01:46.360]  to carry the nightly news in this show so it just shows its word of mouth it's exactly word of
[03:01:46.360 --> 03:01:51.000]  mouth and that's the point alex you didn't even realize how prophetic you were and how enduring
[03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:58.200]  you were but cnn is not prophetic and i mean anderson cooper did his internships at the cia he
[03:01:58.200 --> 03:02:04.200]  came out of jail i mean the man can't even speak the truth and it's not effective people aboard
[03:02:04.200 --> 03:02:09.480]  by it they board by fox as well i have to tell you i know rise rails i respect them very much but
[03:02:09.480 --> 03:02:15.240]  it's nothing more than show business it turns you have literally gone forth you took the risk
[03:02:15.240 --> 03:02:19.240]  people want to learn they want to hear different points of view and they're really not interested
[03:02:19.240 --> 03:02:25.640]  in what cable has to say or tv has to say and you saw it the market worked that turner broadcasting
[03:02:25.640 --> 03:02:31.000]  just dropped them so did windstream and now you see that there is no more cnn and they won't come
[03:02:31.000 --> 03:02:36.600]  back on and eventually that nobody will care and that's really what the reality was but you were
[03:02:36.600 --> 03:02:40.520]  more prophetic than you really well forget about me i mean it was obvious when i was there two years
[03:02:40.520 --> 03:02:44.120]  ago they were rotting and i said they're collapsing and i've been taking the last few months look at
[03:02:44.120 --> 03:02:51.960]  their ratings i mean 15 minutes of this radio show rated with arbitron has the ratings of one
[03:02:51.960 --> 03:02:58.040]  of their shows and i'm a small operation how can i have more viewers and listeners than cnn
[03:02:58.040 --> 03:03:03.560]  and how can they still be on tv it's like this facade that was just still standing there same
[03:03:03.560 --> 03:03:10.360]  thing with msnbc how fast could the facade start collapsing dr pacenic well it's collapsing now
[03:03:10.360 --> 03:03:16.680]  nobody's really watching msnbc jeb stoker is not effective he wasn't affected mbc the man who ran
[03:03:16.680 --> 03:03:21.720]  that and he's not affected msnbc nobody wants to hear the repetition of the same story line
[03:03:21.720 --> 03:03:26.440]  same narrative and they don't want to pay that kind of money for it you in turn provide more
[03:03:26.440 --> 03:03:31.640]  punch for the dollar i'm not here to advertise you but you keep it up the point of fact is
[03:03:31.640 --> 03:03:37.640]  you can do it for well over 12 to 13 years where cnn cannot do it well i mean that's that's just since
[03:03:37.640 --> 03:03:43.080]  14 13 years we've been talking i've been on air 20 but i was a lot smaller 20 years right yeah but
[03:03:43.080 --> 03:03:49.240]  you grew they did not grow they went from a lot of money to very ineffectual deleveraging position
[03:03:49.240 --> 03:03:54.040]  remember when time Warner aol the leveraging remember when time Warner aol was the biggest
[03:03:54.040 --> 03:03:59.720]  company in the world yeah but it wasn't in a holy alliance you had time Warner which i was
[03:03:59.720 --> 03:04:04.760]  part of as a book writer and they had money and aol was the paper company we had nothing more than
[03:04:04.760 --> 03:04:10.600]  that the paper and basically aol now is really not very effective it doesn't grow and most of
[03:04:10.600 --> 03:04:17.160]  the institutions are too large they can't provide what they can't adapt so this well listen i agree
[03:04:17.160 --> 03:04:21.720]  with you the establishment is a joke if people will just stand up to it and you're an example of
[03:04:21.720 --> 03:04:25.320]  that i'm an example our listeners are i'm sorry to all the callers i'm out of time
[03:04:25.320 --> 03:04:30.120]  dr patrick thank you so much for the time today interesting perspective uh on the whole honor
