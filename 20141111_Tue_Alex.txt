[00:00:04.983 --> 00:00:06.284]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.284 --> 00:00:08.045]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.045 --> 00:00:09.806]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.806 --> 00:00:11.387]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.387 --> 00:00:12.928]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.928 --> 00:00:17.130]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.192]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.517 --> 00:00:46.865]  Well, we had him on Sunday, and he was basically starting to tell all about the real power struggles going on between different agencies in the federal government.
[00:00:46.865 --> 00:00:49.647]  So, Dr. Steve Pucinich is going to be on with us in the third hour.
[00:00:49.647 --> 00:00:56.753]  We'll have open phones for the last 30 minutes, so you can ask Steve Pucinich your own questions.
[00:00:56.753 --> 00:00:58.175]  So, that's coming up today.
[00:00:59.656 --> 00:01:15.205]  We also have Edward T. Haslaman, who wrote Dr. Mary's Monkey, how the unsolved murder of a doctor, a secret laboratory in New Orleans, and cancer-causing monkey viruses are linked to Lee Harvey Oswald, the JFK assassination, and emerging global pandemics.
[00:01:15.205 --> 00:01:16.566]  Forward by Jim Mars.
[00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:19.848]  We sell this book at InfoWareStore.com, but that's a side issue.
[00:01:19.848 --> 00:01:25.272]  The reason it's important is it gets into how they manufacture a lot of these pandemics.
[00:01:26.152 --> 00:01:28.456]  And a lot of times the cure is worse than the disease.
[00:01:28.456 --> 00:01:36.809]  So we'll spend 30 minutes with the author of Dr. Mary's Monkey, excellent book, getting into the weaponization of cancer.
[00:01:37.941 --> 00:01:44.144]  More than just focusing in on Ebola and the laboratories developing that, getting a different perspective.
[00:01:44.144 --> 00:01:53.828]  We had, of course, the gentleman Stephen Hatfield, the doctor who was accused of anthrax on, the top bioweapons expert, to get into Ebola.
[00:01:53.828 --> 00:01:57.329]  Some people said, we don't agree with the stuff he said in his views.
[00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.350]  Well, we bring you different perspectives.
[00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.291]  This is not a cult.
[00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.006]  And then I tell you what I think is going on, as best I can tell, and you can make up your own mind.
[00:02:07.006 --> 00:02:10.909]  Kind of like Fox News always said, we report, you decide.
[00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:14.853]  The Democrats said, you know, they distort, you decide.
[00:02:14.853 --> 00:02:20.379]  But as far as I'm concerned, all those big media outlets have a globalist agenda.
[00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:29.934]  I have an agenda of trying to tell the truth, trying to be accurate, trying to build a better world for my children and a better world for your children because they're going to live together into the future.
[00:02:29.934 --> 00:02:34.396]  We're all on this ship together.
[00:02:34.396 --> 00:02:38.138]  We'll open the phones up in the first hour today as well.
[00:02:38.138 --> 00:02:39.779]  Ferguson is really heating up.
[00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:50.104]  They can say that the verdict of the grand jury on whether to indict the police officer or not is going to be coming out in a matter of three or four days.
[00:02:50.104 --> 00:02:50.825]  It could be any minute.
[00:02:52.315 --> 00:02:54.376]  They are bracing for it.
[00:02:54.376 --> 00:02:58.437]  I think the longer they wait, the worse they make it.
[00:02:58.437 --> 00:03:03.499]  Because it's just building and the media is now covering it, throwing gas on the fire.
[00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:06.260]  You can't really blame them though, it is a news issue.
[00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:12.061]  Because what we've seen with Obama and MSNBC is a pure racial division agenda.
[00:03:12.061 --> 00:03:13.462]  Taking everybody fighting with each other.
[00:03:14.696 --> 00:03:25.001]  And the attempt to legitimize things like the knockout game and what I'd call black-on-white, black-Klan type activity.
[00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:26.381]  Humans are just humans.
[00:03:26.381 --> 00:03:30.583]  Humans have the same types in all, quote, groups.
[00:03:30.583 --> 00:03:32.264]  And they act the same.
[00:03:32.264 --> 00:03:36.866]  And it was kosher for the Klan in the South in some areas to attack black people.
[00:03:38.433 --> 00:03:39.873]  And so they did it.
[00:03:39.873 --> 00:03:51.677]  And now it's kosher to take any wrong towards a black person in some areas and project it onto whites in general.
[00:03:51.677 --> 00:03:55.878]  And there obviously are a lot of police abuses as well, so that throws gas on the fire.
[00:03:55.878 --> 00:04:02.540]  There's a lot of mistrust of the government in general, and that rolls downhill on the police departments.
[00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.860]  The globalists do want to divide and conquer.
[00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.441]  They do want us fighting with the cops, though.
[00:04:07.452 --> 00:04:09.493]  They do want an us-against-them mentality.
[00:04:09.493 --> 00:04:15.674]  The last thing they want us to do is to take control of our local police departments and reach out to them.
[00:04:15.674 --> 00:04:18.795]  That will break the globalist takeover through the Feds.
[00:04:18.795 --> 00:04:29.459]  And that's why I've really attempted to hold up good police in the last five, six years, instead of just knee-jerk reaction, attack the police constantly, because that's what the globalists want.
[00:04:32.222 --> 00:04:37.407]  We have to not have the Civil War, and Ferguson... I just got chills.
[00:04:37.407 --> 00:04:41.230]  Every time I talk about him, I do, because it's... We're on the verge of Civil War.
[00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:47.496]  Homeland Security has set it all up, they've stirred it all up, and are we dumb enough to kill each other?
[00:04:47.496 --> 00:04:52.280]  In fact, get me the From Russia With Love clip, please, about the fighting fish.
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.321]  The Siamese fighting fish.
[00:04:53.321 --> 00:04:55.643]  We're going to talk about that when we come back.
[00:04:55.643 --> 00:04:56.164]  Stay with us.
[00:04:58.957 --> 00:05:09.524]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[00:05:09.524 --> 00:05:15.988]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:05:15.988 --> 00:05:18.310]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.411]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality.
[00:05:21.411 --> 00:05:28.276]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:05:28.792 --> 00:05:32.455]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:05:32.455 --> 00:05:36.738]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:05:36.738 --> 00:05:38.519]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:46.384]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:05:46.384 --> 00:05:47.525]  But for how long?
[00:05:47.525 --> 00:05:54.170]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.972]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:05:58.345 --> 00:06:04.746]  When I first got online and I seen the price of the X2 and the DNA Force, I was a little hesitant, but I pulled the trigger on it.
[00:06:04.746 --> 00:06:05.747]  It has changed my life.
[00:06:05.747 --> 00:06:07.927]  I've been taking it for about 24 days now.
[00:06:07.927 --> 00:06:09.447]  Counting the weights, staying in shape.
[00:06:09.447 --> 00:06:11.988]  InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:06:11.988 --> 00:06:13.448]  You've heard the callers to the show.
[00:06:13.448 --> 00:06:17.449]  Several months back, I started taking your nascent iodine and your super meal.
[00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:19.429]  Prior to this, I was barely walking.
[00:06:19.429 --> 00:06:22.070]  Now, I'm able to function as a human again.
[00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:39.647]  Whether it's Survival Shield Nascent Iodine or DNA Force, Super Male Vitality, Super Female Vitality, Lung Cleanse, Fluoride Shield, Oxy Powder, I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:40.107 --> 00:06:41.869]  That's true.
[00:06:41.869 --> 00:06:45.712]  Just amazing what it's able to do to actually detox the body.
[00:06:45.712 --> 00:06:46.513]  It's great stuff.
[00:06:46.513 --> 00:06:50.576]  If I'm going to promote something, it's got to be something I personally use and that I believe in.
[00:06:50.576 --> 00:06:57.302]  Check out Infowarslife.com today and the entire line of groundbreaking, cutting-edge, hardcore products.
[00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:08.336]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[00:07:08.336 --> 00:07:18.261]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new oxy powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[00:07:18.261 --> 00:07:21.183]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body.
[00:07:21.383 --> 00:07:21.663]  I think?
[00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:36.600]  We're good.
[00:08:10.451 --> 00:08:14.041]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:08:14.041 --> 00:08:18.212]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:43.867 --> 00:08:45.788]  Siamese fighting fish.
[00:08:45.788 --> 00:08:47.328]  Fascinating creatures.
[00:08:47.328 --> 00:08:50.628]  Brave, but on the whole stupid.
[00:08:50.628 --> 00:08:53.169]  Yes, they're stupid.
[00:08:53.169 --> 00:08:57.990]  Except for the occasional one such as we have here, who lets the other two fight.
[00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:07.051]  And he waits.
[00:09:07.051 --> 00:09:11.412]  Waits until the survivor is so exhausted that he cannot defend himself.
[00:09:12.811 --> 00:09:18.173]  And then, like Spectre, he strikes.
[00:09:18.173 --> 00:09:20.373]  I find the parallel amusing.
[00:09:20.373 --> 00:09:29.576]  Our organization did not arrange for you to come over from the Russians just for amusement, Number 3.
[00:09:29.576 --> 00:09:31.357]  Come in, Kronstein.
[00:09:31.357 --> 00:09:36.118]  Sit down, Number 3, while we listen to what Number 5 has devised for us.
[00:09:36.118 --> 00:09:41.900]  I hope Kronstein's efforts as Director of Planning will continue to be as successful as his chess.
[00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:42.400]  They will be.
[00:09:43.266 --> 00:09:50.230]  According to your instructions, I've planned for Spectre to steal from the Russians their new electro-decoding machine.
[00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:58.815]  For this, we need the services of a female member of the Russian Cryptograph Section in Turkey, and the help of the British Secret Service.
[00:09:58.815 --> 00:10:01.117]  Naturally, neither the Russians nor the British will be aware.
[00:10:01.738 --> 00:10:03.999]  That they are now working for us.
[00:10:03.999 --> 00:10:07.702]  Number three, is your section ready to carry out Kronstein's directives?
[00:10:07.702 --> 00:10:08.702]  Yes, number one.
[00:10:08.702 --> 00:10:12.025]  The operation will be organized according to Kronstein's plan.
[00:10:12.025 --> 00:10:15.327]  I have selected a suitable girl from the Russian consulate in Istanbul.
[00:10:15.327 --> 00:10:20.770]  She's capable, cooperative, and her loyalty to the state is beyond question.
[00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:25.233]  And you're absolutely sure she believes you're still head of operations for Soviet intelligence?
[00:10:25.828 --> 00:10:29.050]  It is most unlikely she would know I'm now working for Spectre.
[00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:33.352]  Moskva has kept my defection secret from everyone but a few members of the Presidium.
[00:10:33.352 --> 00:10:35.673]  For your sake, I hope so.
[00:10:35.673 --> 00:10:39.255]  Kronstein, you are sure this plan is foolproof?
[00:10:39.255 --> 00:10:40.795]  Yes, it is.
[00:10:40.795 --> 00:10:45.278]  Because I have anticipated every possible variation of counter-move.
[00:10:45.278 --> 00:10:51.501]  But what makes you think that M, the head of British intelligence, will oblige you by falling in with your plan?
[00:10:51.501 --> 00:10:53.682]  For the simple reason that this is so obviously a trap.
[00:10:54.494 --> 00:10:59.799]  My reading of the British mentality is that they always treat a trap as a challenge.
[00:10:59.799 --> 00:11:04.763]  And in any case, they couldn't possibly pass up even the slightest chance of getting their hands on the electro-decoder.
[00:11:06.044 --> 00:11:08.205]  They have wanted one for years.
[00:11:08.205 --> 00:11:08.965]  Mm-hmm.
[00:11:08.965 --> 00:11:10.706]  All that you say could be true.
[00:11:10.706 --> 00:11:11.627]  What else?
[00:11:11.627 --> 00:11:18.930]  As an added refinement, I think that Spectre would probably have the chance of a personal revenge for the killing of our operative, Doctor No.
[00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:26.294]  Because the man the British will almost certainly use on a mission of this sort would be their agent, James Bond.
[00:11:26.294 --> 00:11:31.096]  Let his death be a particularly unpleasant, humiliating one.
[00:11:31.096 --> 00:11:32.377]  Good.
[00:11:32.377 --> 00:11:34.598]  I shall put my plan into operation straight away.
[00:11:35.459 --> 00:11:38.220]  And there will be no failure.
[00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:47.683]  I have probably played that clip 20 times over the years because it's Divide and Conquer.
[00:11:47.683 --> 00:11:56.166]  Jakari Jackson made a little piece detailing it, comparing it to the fictitious character Cobra Commander.
[00:11:56.166 --> 00:12:00.468]  But when you understand that high-level OSS and then MI6
[00:12:02.313 --> 00:12:10.456]  Fleming, Ian Fleming wrote the James Bond books that then became the movie.
[00:12:10.456 --> 00:12:12.517]  The films.
[00:12:12.517 --> 00:12:15.518]  Then you understand how shocking it all is.
[00:12:15.518 --> 00:12:19.859]  Because they're basically telling you what's really going on.
[00:12:19.859 --> 00:12:22.060]  Of course, I wouldn't call it Spectre.
[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:24.681]  I would call it the Carlisle Group.
[00:12:27.463 --> 00:12:34.289]  I wouldn't call it chaos, to use the Get Smart comedy.
[00:12:34.289 --> 00:12:40.574]  I would call it the Bilderberg Group.
[00:12:40.574 --> 00:12:55.687]  When you look at the Trilateral Commission, the CFR, the UN, it's only a few hundred people that chair and head up all these organizations and then they interface with the corporate heads who have a moon raker plan.
[00:12:57.113 --> 00:13:00.416]  We're living in their master plan.
[00:13:00.416 --> 00:13:04.779]  We know a lot of their plan because much of it's public.
[00:13:04.779 --> 00:13:12.766]  What they wrote about in the 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, that's been declassified, we can now see was actually carried out.
[00:13:12.766 --> 00:13:22.154]  And you can follow their previous long-term engineering project and see where it's going.
[00:13:22.154 --> 00:13:24.395]  The secret space programs, the
[00:13:25.811 --> 00:13:53.849]  Other secret programs that are going on are so advanced, the elite now behave as if we don't even exist, and the public decisions have been made and have been publicly announced in scores of publications that the clean-up world government is being established, the robots and computers and smart grids are now being put in place, the tentacles are being sent out to tie into every system, and the Great War
[00:13:55.436 --> 00:14:06.142]  Against humanity is now being launched, but incrementally in third world areas where communications aren't good and where people can't get word out or get help.
[00:14:06.142 --> 00:14:18.890]  And then we will sit back afar, accepting the technocracy as a cocoon of protection as we're under these great black wings of the carrion beast.
[00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:24.453]  And then it'll be phased in incrementally into the Plandopolis, the social engineering,
[00:14:26.394 --> 00:14:45.809]  Viruses are already being released into the vaccine, nanotech-engineered systems they call viruses, to reduce fertility as if we are living in children of men, the film, until only artificial babies will be capable of being produced.
[00:14:45.809 --> 00:14:48.811]  That's being phased in now.
[00:14:48.811 --> 00:14:55.176]  But humans are an incredibly resilient species, and we'll have our own mutations against what's being done to us.
[00:14:55.176 --> 00:14:56.137]  The system knows that.
[00:14:58.564 --> 00:15:11.969]  And there will be a cultural, societal, genetic, race memory through all of the derivations of Homo sapiens sapiens and hybrid Homo sapiens sapiens.
[00:15:11.969 --> 00:15:18.191]  And there will be a conscious response, a subconscious response, a mass subconscious response.
[00:15:19.051 --> 00:15:35.491]  That the establishment is fully aware of and trying to gauge and control and placate through movies and culture that are giving us simulated race consciousness victories while on the physical plane we are being destroyed.
[00:15:35.491 --> 00:15:37.613]  And that's why you're seeing so many Hollywood films.
[00:15:39.181 --> 00:15:52.628]  Come out basically telling the truth, decrying the police state, decrying the technocracy, decrying those that don't want us to get off the planet, decrying the eugenicist, is because it's a revelation of the method.
[00:15:52.628 --> 00:16:02.434]  And even the producers and writers of those films don't understand this until they're told it by people like me.
[00:16:02.434 --> 00:16:06.056]  And then their mouths hang open and they say, that's why
[00:16:07.247 --> 00:16:13.808]  They wouldn't let us do this in the past, but now, it's not just about the money, because freedom is popular.
[00:16:13.808 --> 00:16:15.909]  That's why we were approached by the CIA.
[00:16:15.909 --> 00:16:18.049]  That's why we were approached by MIT.
[00:16:18.049 --> 00:16:21.550]  That's why we were approached by the Ford Foundation or Carnegie Endowment for Peace.
[00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:24.390]  That's why they made recommendations of changes.
[00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:35.052]  Because they're just giving you a revelation of the method of what they're doing, so your subconscious mind is prepared and comfortable with the death of the species.
[00:16:36.894 --> 00:16:57.926]  And out of that mutagenic abomination, they believe will rise the mutated human species to merge with the computers, to merge with the silicon life form, and the new species will be born, and it might as well be as alien as something from a trillion light years away coming through a wormhole.
[00:16:59.005 --> 00:17:04.068]  But it won't come from a wormhole, and it won't come from the Horsehead Nebula.
[00:17:04.068 --> 00:17:09.072]  It will come from this planetoid orbiting that standard sun.
[00:17:09.072 --> 00:17:10.253]  Remember that.
[00:17:10.253 --> 00:17:18.498]  When you sit here and think, this is whacked out stuff, you are on a planetoid orbiting a sun.
[00:17:18.498 --> 00:17:23.542]  An asteroid belt and Mars lay out towards the gas giants and the Kuiper belt.
[00:17:25.305 --> 00:17:42.035]  And the great long march of our species, the nomads, and our love of inventiveness and of working together against impossible odds and against creatures far more powerful than us, we have conquered the planet.
[00:17:42.035 --> 00:17:47.298]  And we're sold that that's an evil idea and a bad thing because they don't want you to admire yourself.
[00:17:47.298 --> 00:17:50.880]  They don't want you to have that dignity of where you come from as a species.
[00:17:53.134 --> 00:17:57.796]  That's why the most low of us still is an amazing creature.
[00:17:57.796 --> 00:18:04.239]  But they've been turned into golem-like creatures, scrabbling after the cygnets and symbols of success.
[00:18:04.239 --> 00:18:18.725]  The logos of power, not the true power that already beats in your breast as the blue blood pours through your veins and arteries.
[00:18:18.725 --> 00:18:20.545]  And no, I'm not saying we're all blue bloods.
[00:18:20.545 --> 00:18:21.546]  Your blood is blue.
[00:18:23.131 --> 00:18:26.797]  It's blue in your veins and red in your arteries.
[00:18:26.797 --> 00:18:31.464]  When it spills out on the ground, it's black.
[00:18:31.464 --> 00:18:34.849]  And it's destined to colonize the universe.
[00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:51.716]  And these evil priests of the Illuminati, sitting there as the preachers, up in their pulpits, up in their satanic command bases, tell you you're destined to fall, you're destined to fail, you're destined to die, you're destined to roll over, you're destined to submit.
[00:18:51.716 --> 00:18:58.019]  And that when you act like a lowly coward, rolling around on the ground, you'll be teleported out.
[00:18:58.019 --> 00:19:03.961]  Every time I see these emails and texts about, you shouldn't say you defend your family if a killer came in your house, Christ wouldn't do that.
[00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:08.931]  You should lay down when an intruder comes and pee on them.
[00:19:08.931 --> 00:19:10.231]  Those are the comments on YouTube.
[00:19:10.231 --> 00:19:11.292]  That's what the feds advise.
[00:19:11.292 --> 00:19:15.173]  Of course, Christ said, sell your garment, buy a sword.
[00:19:15.173 --> 00:19:19.654]  Christ beat the money changers with a whip.
[00:19:19.654 --> 00:19:24.636]  All the other prophets, you name it, didn't go along with what they were ordered to do.
[00:19:24.636 --> 00:19:24.936]  They stood.
[00:19:31.047 --> 00:19:32.508]  John the Baptist, all of them.
[00:19:32.508 --> 00:19:41.051]  Christ gave himself up as a sacrifice to be abused and to be tortured as an example.
[00:19:41.051 --> 00:19:45.693]  To be the phoenix rising from the ashes.
[00:19:45.693 --> 00:19:48.994]  Christ was there to take the fall and rise again.
[00:19:48.994 --> 00:19:50.995]  Christ was there to be martyred.
[00:19:50.995 --> 00:19:54.036]  That's why he let them kill him.
[00:19:54.036 --> 00:19:56.317]  Not because Christians are supposed to lie down and be murdered.

[00:21:19.768 --> 00:21:23.051]  If you do, are you willing to bet your life on it?
[00:21:23.051 --> 00:21:24.311]  Children left with no homes.
[00:21:24.311 --> 00:21:26.133]  And no one's coming to help them.
[00:21:26.133 --> 00:21:28.975]  The first step towards self-reliance in the face of disaster.
[00:21:29.175 --> 00:21:30.296]  It's time to prepare!
[00:21:58.214 --> 00:22:04.580]  When I first got online and I seen the price of the X2 and the DNA Force, I was a little hesitant, but I pulled the trigger on it.
[00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:05.561]  It has changed my life.
[00:22:05.561 --> 00:22:07.743]  I've been taking it for about 24 days now.
[00:22:07.743 --> 00:22:09.265]  Counting the weights, staying in shape.

[00:24:23.762 --> 00:24:27.382]  I'm coming to you live from Austin, Texas.
[00:24:27.382 --> 00:24:30.443]  Deep in the heart of Texas.
[00:24:30.443 --> 00:24:31.123]  FEMA Region 6.
[00:24:31.123 --> 00:24:37.725]  It's Veterans Day.
[00:24:37.725 --> 00:24:46.687]  And I wonder in all these parades and events they're going to be having, I think they're great, are they going to talk about the death panels and the secret death lists and all the major VAs?
[00:24:46.687 --> 00:24:47.467]  Are they going to talk about
[00:24:48.516 --> 00:24:55.400]  How they're trying to take veterans who have non-violent records, have done nothing wrong, take their guns.
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:25:00.082]  Because in the Homeland Security reports, they say the veterans are the new terrorists.
[00:25:00.082 --> 00:25:07.045]  There was another report out yesterday with a police chief saying they need the MRAPs to fight returning veterans.
[00:25:07.045 --> 00:25:07.706]  The armored vehicles.
[00:25:09.261 --> 00:25:14.482]  And they just keep saying, veterans will IED, improvise explosive device, your department.
[00:25:14.482 --> 00:25:22.004]  That's in federal documents, been in the news for five, six years, that they tell them, you're training to fight veterans, they're going to bomb you.
[00:25:22.004 --> 00:25:28.786]  You know, cops, let me just say something, because I know you're not stupid, when it comes to criminal stuff on average.
[00:25:28.786 --> 00:25:30.186]  No more about the public, I'll say that.
[00:25:30.186 --> 00:25:37.308]  Even though they're trying to hire dumb detectives and people now, because criminals run the government, don't want to be found out.
[00:25:37.308 --> 00:25:38.148]  That's on record as well.
[00:25:39.466 --> 00:25:54.195]  If there's no crime going on, if somebody keeps saying, that house is going to get burned down, that house is going to get burned down, and files a bunch of reports in a year, and there's no evidence and no suspect, and then the house burns down, who do you go talk to?
[00:25:54.195 --> 00:26:02.520]  You go talk to the person that keeps saying, somebody's going to burn that church down, or somebody's going to burn that down, or somebody's going to throw them all off cocktails at the governor's mansion.
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:07.923]  You go to that person, because obviously they're the prime suspect, and nine times out of ten it's going to end up being them.
[00:26:09.352 --> 00:26:12.454]  Inside job.
[00:26:12.454 --> 00:26:25.284]  So they just keep saying, in fact that's that scrolled off, that's in Featured News Archive, you print me that, the headlines like Top Cops says MRAPs are for the Tea Party and then it gets into veterans in the article.
[00:26:25.284 --> 00:26:26.945]  And the Pentagon trains for that.
[00:26:26.945 --> 00:26:29.207]  The Tea Party is not doing anything.
[00:26:29.207 --> 00:26:31.429]  Has the lowest crime rate in all the statistics out there.
[00:26:32.691 --> 00:26:35.973]  Conservatives, Libertarians, Christians, everybody knows that.
[00:26:35.973 --> 00:26:37.694]  It's in the criminology reports.
[00:26:37.694 --> 00:26:39.155]  So why is that the main threat?
[00:26:39.155 --> 00:26:40.235]  Because you're not criminals.
[00:26:40.235 --> 00:26:41.256]  That's why.
[00:26:41.256 --> 00:26:49.680]  Because the government's planning stuff so evil, so over-the-top, so criminal, the illegitimate government, that it wants to get the cops ready and tell you that's the enemy.
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:51.541]  Well, you're not stupid, police.
[00:26:51.541 --> 00:26:53.743]  Don't you have a lot more in common with the vets?
[00:26:53.743 --> 00:26:59.506]  Most of you are vets than you do with the scumbag politicians that have run this country to the ground intentionally.
[00:27:00.598 --> 00:27:02.159]  So that's what I think about on Veterans Day.
[00:27:02.159 --> 00:27:16.332]  I think about on Veterans Day the fact that what they're doing in Obamacare and the rationing and the death list and the death panels and all the things that have now been admitted has been tested out at least the last six years, seven years.
[00:27:16.332 --> 00:27:18.815]  It did get worse under Obama, you just can't deny it.
[00:27:18.815 --> 00:27:22.818]  They started putting the veterans by the tens of thousands a year on a no treatment list.
[00:27:24.133 --> 00:27:25.734]  It's the law to treat them.
[00:27:25.734 --> 00:27:27.554]  The money's been paid to treat them.
[00:27:27.554 --> 00:27:29.095]  It's not that you don't have the money to treat them.
[00:27:29.095 --> 00:27:30.635]  You just give them pills.
[00:27:30.635 --> 00:27:32.076]  And it's a death panel.
[00:27:32.076 --> 00:27:34.037]  It's a bioethics committee.
[00:27:34.037 --> 00:27:37.858]  You hear them saying, don't, you know, kill kids up to age five, kill old people.
[00:27:37.858 --> 00:27:39.599]  This is what's going on.
[00:27:39.599 --> 00:27:41.660]  This is being sold that, hey, you're of no use.
[00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:42.660]  We're going to kill you.
[00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:44.141]  Hey, grandma's of no use.
[00:27:44.141 --> 00:27:44.801]  Throw it on a well.
[00:27:45.794 --> 00:27:47.874]  This is such a barbarous society.
[00:27:47.874 --> 00:27:55.636]  We've had VA supervisors on record before all this broke saying older veterans should be shot in the head to save money.
[00:27:55.636 --> 00:27:59.497]  We reported that before the veteran scandal broke.
[00:27:59.497 --> 00:28:01.537]  That's their attitude towards them.
[00:28:01.537 --> 00:28:04.138]  We have major whistleblowers on.
[00:28:04.138 --> 00:28:11.940]  That whistleblower is in the top five people in the hospital, in the huge medical facility.
[00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:13.380]  They're happy to say they're a director.
[00:28:14.434 --> 00:28:18.275]  We got all their credentials, but we didn't use their name.
[00:28:18.275 --> 00:28:19.655]  Major East Coast facility.
[00:28:19.655 --> 00:28:21.196]  One of the biggest in the country.
[00:28:21.196 --> 00:28:23.676]  And the attitude is, we hate the veterans.
[00:28:23.676 --> 00:28:25.577]  By the administrators.
[00:28:25.577 --> 00:28:28.297]  The rank and file are trying to help, on average.
[00:28:28.297 --> 00:28:31.058]  It's the same in every organization.
[00:28:31.058 --> 00:28:32.078]  It's the same story.
[00:28:32.078 --> 00:28:34.279]  So, that's what I'm talking about on Veterans Day.
[00:28:34.279 --> 00:28:39.140]  When we come back, I'm going to get into Obama over in Asia, and I'm going to get into
[00:28:41.035 --> 00:28:42.736]  Depopulation vaccine in Kenya.
[00:28:42.736 --> 00:28:43.797]  Mainstream news.
[00:28:43.797 --> 00:28:47.340]  Sterilizing Africans via the shots.
[00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:49.161]  The UN's been caught.
[00:28:49.161 --> 00:28:52.304]  They don't have major Catholic bishops going public and scientists.
[00:28:52.304 --> 00:28:53.845]  I mean, they're caught red-handed.
[00:28:53.845 --> 00:28:56.567]  But it's Africa, so this is like, oh, nobody cares.
[00:28:56.567 --> 00:28:57.628]  Like over here, nobody cares.
[00:28:57.628 --> 00:28:58.829]  Gardasil shots killing people.
[00:28:58.829 --> 00:29:00.510]  It's not just that they're black Africans.
[00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:01.511]  People don't care, period.
[00:29:01.511 --> 00:29:09.156]  It's this attitude of, well, yeah, 60,000 kids got paralyzed after they took the Bill and Melinda Gates polio vaccine in one year alone in India.
[00:29:11.144 --> 00:29:12.465]  64,000 is the number one.
[00:29:12.465 --> 00:29:12.966]  Big deal.
[00:29:12.966 --> 00:29:13.927]  Yeah, a bunch of them died.
[00:29:13.927 --> 00:29:14.527]  Big deal.
[00:29:14.527 --> 00:29:17.871]  Let's move along now, okay, to how scary the boogeyman is under the table.
[00:29:20.247 --> 00:29:28.709]  When we come back, the University of Pennsylvania deleted the Obamacare architect video after backlash and told Fox News they couldn't air it.
[00:29:28.709 --> 00:29:33.310]  It's fair use to air 30 seconds of something, especially when it's a public university.
[00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:34.671]  And guess what, scumbags?
[00:29:34.671 --> 00:29:36.011]  You may have censored the video.
[00:29:36.011 --> 00:29:40.352]  We're going to play it over and over again now, okay?
[00:29:40.352 --> 00:29:43.173]  Remember the guy that said, yeah, Americans are dumb idiots.
[00:29:43.173 --> 00:29:44.393]  Yeah, we're screwing them over.
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:49.541]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.541 --> 00:29:51.281]  Skunk Empire's on the run.
[00:29:51.281 --> 00:29:52.262]  We're gonna come back.
[00:29:52.262 --> 00:29:59.165]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.165 --> 00:30:00.506]  The experts are clear.
[00:30:00.506 --> 00:30:07.609]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[00:30:07.609 --> 00:30:13.892]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:30:13.892 --> 00:30:17.454]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[00:30:17.594 --> 00:30:21.817]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[00:30:21.817 --> 00:30:27.140]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:28.140]  Not our iodine.
[00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:31.963]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[00:30:31.963 --> 00:30:34.504]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[00:32:05.778 --> 00:32:06.999]  Security alert.
[00:32:06.999 --> 00:32:08.999]  This is Homeland Security.
[00:32:08.999 --> 00:32:09.900]  Analysis.
[00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:12.701]  InfoWars building into the media operation.
[00:32:12.701 --> 00:32:17.582]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[00:32:17.582 --> 00:32:18.623]  Crime directive.
[00:32:18.623 --> 00:32:20.163]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[00:32:20.163 --> 00:32:23.004]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[00:32:23.004 --> 00:32:26.265]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[00:32:26.265 --> 00:32:28.426]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[00:32:28.726 --> 00:32:30.087]  These people are assaulting us.
[00:32:30.087 --> 00:32:32.908]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[00:32:32.908 --> 00:32:34.869]  They are never going to stop.
[00:32:34.869 --> 00:32:38.910]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[00:32:45.853 --> 00:32:46.854]  Imperative.
[00:32:46.854 --> 00:32:48.875]  Destroy Little Planet TV.
[00:32:48.875 --> 00:32:53.397]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[00:32:53.397 --> 00:32:54.937]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[00:32:54.937 --> 00:32:55.678]  You can feel it.
[00:33:21.047 --> 00:33:25.131]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:25.131 --> 00:33:29.755]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:29.755 --> 00:33:35.941]  Well, I said it yesterday, and I'm very careful about my words, and I'll say it again.
[00:33:35.941 --> 00:33:44.589]  When you are hired by the White House to be part of an advisor to come up with a strategy on rolling out Obamacare,
[00:33:45.660 --> 00:34:05.529]  That has the eugenics, bioethics, rationing of care, death panels in them, that is written by foreign insurance companies to double and then triple and then quadruple over five years the average premium of healthy people that have been insured for decades, like my dad and my mother.
[00:34:05.529 --> 00:34:08.091]  We've already seen a doubling now.
[00:34:08.091 --> 00:34:10.312]  And myself, it's gone up almost double.
[00:34:10.312 --> 00:34:10.932]  For my family.
[00:34:12.219 --> 00:34:24.601]  And you say we package it this way so that Congress wouldn't know it was a tax, so we could roll it through and transparency was key in getting it over on the dumb voters.
[00:34:24.601 --> 00:34:27.002]  And the other professors are nodding.
[00:34:27.002 --> 00:34:30.422]  That is a criminal conspiracy.
[00:34:30.422 --> 00:34:32.762]  And that is a confession.
[00:34:32.762 --> 00:34:41.404]  I don't know of a grand jury out there that wouldn't say that it wasn't fraud to write reports and to go out and be a pundit
[00:34:43.632 --> 00:34:56.121]  Remember, it was like seven, eight years ago, there was a Washington Post headline, GAO, General Accounting Office, rules that fake news is illegal.
[00:34:56.121 --> 00:35:01.004]  In fact, you can probably type in, GAO rules fake news is illegal.
[00:35:01.004 --> 00:35:10.951]  And it reported on tens of billions spent by the federal government, directed by the White House, but Congress was involved, to buy off
[00:35:13.752 --> 00:35:27.195]  The media, behind the scenes to pay money to Fox News, CNN, Armstrong Williams was the one guy, they always pick one guy when a big corrupt story comes out.
[00:35:27.195 --> 00:35:38.778]  Oh, he got $200,000 or $340,000 to go around on a syndicated radio show, and he's been on the show before, he's a pretty good guy, but he took that money to go and promote Head Start and say it was conservative to federalize education.
[00:35:38.778 --> 00:35:42.359]  It's through Head Start that Michelle Obama gets to tell your kids what to eat.
[00:35:44.172 --> 00:35:45.073]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:35:45.073 --> 00:35:46.013]  Washington Post.
[00:35:46.013 --> 00:35:48.695]  Administration rejects ruling on PR videos.
[00:35:48.695 --> 00:35:52.638]  GAO called tapes illegal propaganda.
[00:35:52.638 --> 00:35:53.778]  Man, my memory's good.
[00:35:53.778 --> 00:35:54.079]  2005.
[00:35:54.079 --> 00:35:57.121]  I said six, seven years ago, though.
[00:35:57.121 --> 00:35:58.361]  My memory wasn't good on that.
[00:35:58.361 --> 00:36:02.184]  Okay, so time flies.
[00:36:02.184 --> 00:36:03.265]  I look up, it's like 2014, about 2015.
[00:36:03.265 --> 00:36:04.826]  I can't even believe it now.
[00:36:09.818 --> 00:36:15.721]  So, when I say this is illegal, I'm ready to be sued.
[00:36:15.721 --> 00:36:19.463]  And knock on wood, I haven't been for defamation or slander or libel.
[00:36:19.463 --> 00:36:22.804]  I've had a few threats and I've said, okay, here's my lawyers, here's our defense.
[00:36:22.804 --> 00:36:26.987]  They stick their tail between their legs, because I'm ready to go to court with this guy.
[00:36:26.987 --> 00:36:28.767]  I'm ready to go to court with Obama.
[00:36:28.767 --> 00:36:32.309]  I'm ready to have them throw me in that briar patch any day.
[00:36:32.309 --> 00:36:35.211]  I know criminal activity when I see it.
[00:36:35.211 --> 00:36:37.752]  And when they sit up there on television,
[00:36:40.012 --> 00:36:56.602]  And in print media, and say we lied to people and they're dumb, it's like Zuckerberg saying, our users trust us, they're dumb effers.
[00:36:56.602 --> 00:36:58.803]  These people have made you billions of dollars, Zuckerberg.
[00:36:58.803 --> 00:37:03.466]  You sold them a pump and dump on your Facebook stock.
[00:37:05.018 --> 00:37:06.118]  You censor people.
[00:37:06.118 --> 00:37:07.199]  You manipulate.
[00:37:07.199 --> 00:37:08.239]  You claim you're free and open.
[00:37:08.239 --> 00:37:08.599]  You're not.
[00:37:08.599 --> 00:37:09.699]  You're a fraud.
[00:37:09.699 --> 00:37:10.280]  But you know what?
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:21.443]  It's your company and you can have it in the terms and conditions and lawyer speak and cheat people and sell their data and use it, but it's not illegal.
[00:37:21.443 --> 00:37:26.524]  He admits to calling them dumb effers.
[00:37:26.524 --> 00:37:33.866]  But when you work in the government and you take money to be in a commission and then you lie and deceive, is that not fraud?
[00:37:35.111 --> 00:37:36.853]  Is fraud not illegal?
[00:37:36.853 --> 00:37:41.096]  I want this professor prosecuted.
[00:37:41.096 --> 00:38:01.052]  And I'm going to make some phone calls and talk to some criminal lawyers I know and others and make sure I get all the proper terms straight but I mean just under the propaganda function to be paid to go out and deceive is illegal GAO ruling and there's a bunch of other federal and state rulings not just a bureaucratic ruling.
[00:38:01.052 --> 00:38:02.814]  But everyone on their face knows
[00:38:04.093 --> 00:38:08.855]  That coming out saying we lied to people to pass something that takes money from them?
[00:38:08.855 --> 00:38:12.097]  That's theft.
[00:38:12.097 --> 00:38:15.678]  Now, maybe this guy isn't consciously a racketeer.
[00:38:15.678 --> 00:38:19.460]  Because when you work with a bunch of other people for a fraud, it's organized.
[00:38:20.248 --> 00:38:21.549]  It's racketeering.
[00:38:21.549 --> 00:38:22.989]  It's a racketeering practice.
[00:38:22.989 --> 00:38:28.991]  Maybe he doesn't know up in his little pinhead ivory tower, as an economist, what he's doing.
[00:38:28.991 --> 00:38:30.892]  Maybe there's an ignorance plea.
[00:38:30.892 --> 00:38:32.133]  But it's kind of like with murder.
[00:38:32.133 --> 00:38:34.814]  Okay, so it's manslaughter, Mac.
[00:38:34.814 --> 00:38:38.195]  You didn't know when you punched him in the face he'd fall over and hit his head on the curb.
[00:38:38.195 --> 00:38:38.915]  Doesn't matter.
[00:38:38.915 --> 00:38:40.456]  You're still liable.
[00:38:40.456 --> 00:38:42.857]  These people need to be punished.
[00:38:42.857 --> 00:38:45.658]  He wants to parade around up there on television.
[00:38:47.233 --> 00:39:00.669]  It was originally on the university network system and then re-aired on C-SPAN, according to reports I have, and then they want to run around and threaten Fox News to not air it saying we don't give you permission.
[00:39:00.669 --> 00:39:02.692]  Hey, you're a bunch of lawyers over there, jerks!
[00:39:05.683 --> 00:39:11.608]  We can't take an entire university transmission and try to sell DVDs of it as if anybody would want to buy that.
[00:39:11.608 --> 00:39:18.433]  But we can take the clip and put it in a film if we want as part of the context and sell it, not that we want to do that.
[00:39:18.433 --> 00:39:27.380]  And we can sure play it on radio and TV to show what you said in a public forum on television about screwing us.
[00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:32.223]  There's a public interest and the public paid for the university.
[00:39:32.223 --> 00:39:33.945]  I would love that lawsuit.
[00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:40.172]  The court would cite you, double the attorney's fees, and time and damages.
[00:39:40.172 --> 00:39:40.512]  I know.
[00:39:40.512 --> 00:39:44.294]  The university's been threatening to sue people now who play the clip.
[00:39:44.294 --> 00:39:44.854]  Good!
[00:39:44.854 --> 00:39:45.774]  Sue me!
[00:39:45.774 --> 00:39:50.356]  I'm not a litigious person, but I will slap you down!
[00:39:50.356 --> 00:39:52.857]  I can't believe how stupid all these lawyers are.
[00:39:52.857 --> 00:39:54.018]  Or maybe they're not stupid.
[00:39:54.018 --> 00:39:56.799]  Maybe they think I'm dumb, like what you call the public.
[00:39:56.799 --> 00:39:58.460]  I'm not dumb!
[00:39:58.460 --> 00:39:58.920]  I'm not dumb.
[00:39:59.847 --> 00:40:04.649]  I could be more corrupt and evil than all of you combined, but I refuse to screw people.
[00:40:04.649 --> 00:40:06.509]  I refuse to sell out my honor.
[00:40:06.509 --> 00:40:12.491]  So I know all your tricks, you little rat.
[00:40:12.491 --> 00:40:16.813]  This is what Internet 2 is about, where corporations and universities, they get a lot of power in this.
[00:40:18.632 --> 00:40:24.659]  They can shut down administratively your website or your content just by claiming.
[00:40:24.659 --> 00:40:32.067]  Or if you do it three times, no judge, no jury, no adjudication, nothing, they will just ban you off the internet forever.
[00:40:32.067 --> 00:40:34.811]  And that's why Obama announced the end of passcodes.
[00:40:38.151 --> 00:40:45.636]  That's why Obama came out and said, I'm directing that you use biometrics because then they can have you biometrically tied to the internet.
[00:40:45.636 --> 00:40:47.377]  You won't be able to use your smartphone.
[00:40:47.377 --> 00:40:50.879]  You won't be able to use the internet computers if they ban you from the web.
[00:40:50.879 --> 00:40:56.362]  An internet blacklist is what China is now going to biometrically working with Microsoft.
[00:40:56.362 --> 00:40:57.763]  This is their dastardly plan.
[00:40:59.514 --> 00:41:02.076]  Obama's Cyber Security Advisor!
[00:41:02.076 --> 00:41:05.680]  Biometrics will replace passwords for safety's sake!
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:10.504]  It's for your safety!
[00:41:10.504 --> 00:41:11.305]  Maloney!
[00:41:11.305 --> 00:41:15.649]  It's to tax you and track you and control every aspect of your life!
[00:41:15.649 --> 00:41:17.470]  It's another racketeering fraud!
[00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:18.371]  It's racketeering!
[00:41:19.557 --> 00:41:43.672]  When globally, they get together with the car manufacturers and governments, get these big trade agreement summits they have outside of law, that now supersede our law, according to their claims, and say, by the year 2020, by the year 2008, 2008, you can look this up, it's why I stumble, I'm going to memory, by the year 2008,
[00:41:47.486 --> 00:41:55.974]  All cars globally must have the box that tracks everywhere you go, what you do, a record of service, everything.
[00:41:55.974 --> 00:41:59.278]  And now they're adding GPS to it in most cars.
[00:41:59.278 --> 00:42:01.780]  And then they announce, we're going to tax you by the mile.
[00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:09.788]  That is an organized system outside of law, outside of regulation, outside of state or federal law being done by these people.
[00:42:11.613 --> 00:42:12.974]  There's USA Today.
[00:42:12.974 --> 00:42:15.915]  Black boxes for cars raise privacy concerns.
[00:42:15.915 --> 00:42:17.875]  Magically, they're globally standardized.
[00:42:17.875 --> 00:42:29.080]  Magically, they started taxing people in a trial program in New York, New York, Austin, Texas, and San Francisco.
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:31.401]  It's always the trendy areas.
[00:42:31.401 --> 00:42:32.841]  Oh, I really like it.
[00:42:32.841 --> 00:42:33.842]  Oh, I really like it.
[00:42:34.707 --> 00:42:41.573]  You see, and I'm only giving you a few examples, mechanized, scientific, rolled out, like aliens were doing it or something.
[00:42:41.573 --> 00:42:44.075]  This is a total rewrite of everything.
[00:42:44.075 --> 00:42:48.039]  A huge scientific takeover designed to hurt you and your family.
[00:42:48.039 --> 00:42:50.361]  Period.
[00:42:50.361 --> 00:42:55.025]  And you don't join with this, and then you're just part of the new aristocracy.
[00:42:55.025 --> 00:42:57.948]  You're part of the new elite.
[00:42:57.948 --> 00:42:58.829]  You're an aristocrat.
[00:43:01.886 --> 00:43:10.980]  It was Frank Herbert that said that every rebel is secretly a wannabe aristocrat, to paraphrase his quote.
[00:43:13.203 --> 00:43:17.525]  That's why I've had so many elites say to me, look, just join us, you'll get power, you'll get more with us, just come on.
[00:43:17.525 --> 00:43:21.507]  You're a well of, of, of, of, you know, power and evil.
[00:43:21.507 --> 00:43:22.427]  I'm not bragging, this kind of stuff.
[00:43:22.427 --> 00:43:27.670]  I've been told, you just know you want to join us and you'll get, you're just a pit of ambitions.
[00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:28.710]  You need it.
[00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:32.192]  No, I'm a pit of hating you.
[00:43:32.192 --> 00:43:34.813]  I'm a pit of not standing bullies.
[00:43:34.813 --> 00:43:37.775]  I'm a pit of loving humanity.
[00:43:37.775 --> 00:43:40.116]  I am what my name means, a defender of humanity.
[00:43:42.526 --> 00:43:44.327]  And I don't think that's something special.
[00:43:44.327 --> 00:43:48.710]  I don't understand why everybody likes to screw each other over and stab each other in the back.
[00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:51.052]  I won't be part of it.
[00:43:51.052 --> 00:43:54.754]  When they shovel me into my grave, never.
[00:43:54.754 --> 00:43:59.417]  And I don't want some nanotech blight to get out and kill the atmosphere.
[00:43:59.417 --> 00:44:08.543]  Some andromeda strain that shows up in some laboratory, that's the real threat is the super science stuff that's down here that isn't science fiction at all.
[00:44:08.543 --> 00:44:09.603]  And what the elite are doing
[00:44:10.689 --> 00:44:16.552]  Is out of control, they're out of control, and they are in control, but they are out of control.
[00:44:16.552 --> 00:44:23.176]  They are inept.
[00:44:23.176 --> 00:44:24.297]  Toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[00:44:24.297 --> 00:44:26.518]  First-time callers, again, your chance to get involved on air, 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[00:44:26.518 --> 00:44:28.479]  We are living in epic times.
[00:44:41.004 --> 00:44:45.267]  We are living in incredible times of change.
[00:44:45.267 --> 00:44:46.788]  The best of times, the worst of times.
[00:44:46.788 --> 00:44:48.269]  A tale of two cities.
[00:44:48.269 --> 00:44:49.390]  We are here.
[00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:50.631]  There is so much opportunity.
[00:44:50.631 --> 00:44:52.072]  There is so much wonderment.
[00:44:52.072 --> 00:44:55.754]  There is so much incredible things in this wide, wide world and universe.
[00:44:55.754 --> 00:44:57.496]  There is so much goodness.
[00:44:57.496 --> 00:44:58.636]  There is so much beauty.
[00:44:58.636 --> 00:45:00.578]  There is so much happening.
[00:45:00.578 --> 00:45:04.861]  But it's compartmentalized, it's atomized, and it's scientifically being targeted.
[00:45:05.714 --> 00:45:10.355]  And that's why you know the globalists are bad, because they wage war on virtue.
[00:45:10.355 --> 00:45:12.736]  They wage war on honor.
[00:45:12.736 --> 00:45:15.917]  They seek to pull humanity down instead of empowering humanity.
[00:45:15.917 --> 00:45:22.079]  They've written humanity off.
[00:45:22.079 --> 00:45:25.720]  They don't need beasts of burden anymore.
[00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:28.281]  They don't need soldiers anymore.
[00:45:28.281 --> 00:45:30.441]  They're not going to need police soon.
[00:45:30.441 --> 00:45:31.882]  Or bureaucrats.
[00:45:31.882 --> 00:45:32.382]  Or lawyers.
[00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:41.415]  This is the systematic, incremental, in phases, destruction of our species.
[00:45:41.415 --> 00:46:00.469]  Genetically, we're already being irrevocably damaged, vandalized, and in concentric rings, the New World Order technocrats will pose as the saviors, as they are the authors of our destruction.
[00:46:00.469 --> 00:46:01.790]  And my transmission to you
[00:46:03.095 --> 00:46:23.084]  Is really a warning to those in the future when there is no doubt that you understand who the authors are and were, so that they be convicted in the court of public opinion now and into the future.
[00:46:23.084 --> 00:46:32.388]  But we are facing a time that will be like none other we've seen before and certainly into the future.
[00:46:35.447 --> 00:46:37.088]  It's an epic time.
[00:46:37.088 --> 00:46:49.291]  We are living in the most fantastical science fiction dystopic adventure under hardcore entertainment mind control, hardcore trendy control.
[00:46:49.291 --> 00:46:58.294]  They use our tribal systems of peer pressure and conformity against us.
[00:46:58.294 --> 00:47:02.555]  They use their knowledge of who we are
[00:47:04.332 --> 00:47:11.434]  Like a psychopath uses their knowledge to entice a small child into their creeper van.
[00:47:11.434 --> 00:47:15.256]  We don't admire the psychopath that can trick a child into the van.
[00:47:15.256 --> 00:47:18.277]  We hate them and love them.
[00:47:18.277 --> 00:47:19.737]  Oh, the elite are so smart.
[00:47:19.737 --> 00:47:21.158]  They know how to lie.
[00:47:21.158 --> 00:47:23.738]  Oh, the elite are so cool.
[00:47:23.738 --> 00:47:25.839]  They know how to deceive.
[00:47:25.839 --> 00:47:31.261]  You know how to keep a child in a box so they don't know how to talk, like Skinner did?
[00:47:32.793 --> 00:47:40.216]  And then talk about how smart you are because you could reduce someone down to nothing.
[00:47:40.216 --> 00:47:42.657]  That's what you build?
[00:47:42.657 --> 00:47:45.518]  That's what you do?
[00:47:45.518 --> 00:47:46.919]  I could do that for you in about 10 seconds.
[00:47:46.919 --> 00:47:50.800]  Just get out on the highway and I'll run over you.
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:53.622]  Oh, but you do it slow, don't you?
[00:47:53.622 --> 00:47:57.003]  You enjoy sucking the life force out of the innocent.
[00:47:57.003 --> 00:47:58.363]  Holding us down.
[00:47:58.363 --> 00:47:59.744]  Holding humanity down.
[00:47:59.744 --> 00:48:01.905]  Well, let me tell you, you're not going to hold humanity down forever.
[00:48:05.322 --> 00:48:09.066]  And just like you step on a cockroach, you're not happy when you step on it.
[00:48:09.066 --> 00:48:12.509]  You catch a big one in your kitchen at night.
[00:48:12.509 --> 00:48:18.115]  But you say, sorry, pal, and you grab that catalog that came in in the mail that you're gonna throw away.
[00:48:18.115 --> 00:48:20.097]  You go, pow!
[00:48:20.097 --> 00:48:24.462]  You get a napkin, scoop them up, spray some Windex on there, throw it in the trash.
[00:48:24.462 --> 00:48:26.264]  Throw it in the toilet.
[00:48:26.264 --> 00:48:27.325]  I won't take any pleasure.
[00:48:28.809 --> 00:48:32.491]  And this energy going out to future humans that will defeat you.
[00:48:32.491 --> 00:48:35.052]  This energy doesn't take any pleasure in your destruction.
[00:48:35.052 --> 00:48:36.353]  It just needs to be done.
[00:48:36.353 --> 00:48:38.594]  Because you're a trillion times worse than a cockroach.
[00:48:38.594 --> 00:48:40.915]  A cockroach fulfills an interest.
[00:48:40.915 --> 00:48:44.317]  It fulfills a niche of eating dead meat that needs to be cleaned up.
[00:48:44.317 --> 00:48:46.418]  You kill society so you can feed on the meat.
[00:48:47.915 --> 00:48:59.381]  You would dumb down this whole civilization so you could chase us down easier and feel more powerful because you're stunted and ugly and twisted and you don't like the strong, you don't like the brave, you don't like the good.
[00:48:59.381 --> 00:49:06.324]  It's your fancy to see us fail, to see us stumble, to see us poisoned, to see us confused, to see us in pain.
[00:49:07.637 --> 00:49:11.680]  Let's play this professor, Jonathan Gruber.
[00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:15.042]  They took it off Infowars.com as the report.
[00:49:15.042 --> 00:49:17.263]  They told Fox News they couldn't air it.
[00:49:17.263 --> 00:49:29.212]  Video of Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber saying a lack of transparency was crucial in fooling, quote, stupid Americans, which caused controversy, was subsequently deleted from the University of Pennsylvania, only to be
[00:49:30.262 --> 00:49:33.023]  Reinstated after backlash, the Streisand effect.
[00:49:33.023 --> 00:49:37.165]  And they told Fox News they couldn't air it, so Fox News didn't.
[00:49:37.165 --> 00:49:39.526]  Fox News doesn't ask permission to air our stuff.
[00:49:39.526 --> 00:49:41.447]  They know full well you don't need permission.
[00:49:41.447 --> 00:49:43.768]  Fox News doesn't want to air this.
[00:49:43.768 --> 00:49:46.489]  The Republican leadership doesn't want to get rid of Obamacare.
[00:49:46.489 --> 00:49:48.650]  Rupert Murdoch has endorsed Hillary Clinton.
[00:49:48.650 --> 00:49:50.151]  Do you understand?
[00:49:50.151 --> 00:49:55.393]  With this type of video, and the other architect admitting it's a screw job, we could bring it down!
[00:49:56.189 --> 00:49:58.231]  Let's go to Gurube.
[00:49:58.231 --> 00:50:00.213]  It's just, you can't do it, politically.
[00:50:00.213 --> 00:50:02.316]  You just literally cannot do it, okay?
[00:50:02.316 --> 00:50:06.140]  Transparent financing, and let's not transparent financing, also transparent spending.
[00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:12.747]  I mean, this bill was written in a tortured way to make sure CBO did not score the mandate as taxes.
[00:50:12.747 --> 00:50:14.629]  If CBO scored the mandate as taxes, the bill dies.
[00:50:15.436 --> 00:50:17.297]  Okay, so it's written to do that.
[00:50:17.297 --> 00:50:26.563]  In terms of risk-rated subsidies, if you get a law which said healthy people are going to pay in, it made explicit the healthy will pay in and sick people get money, it would not have passed.
[00:50:26.563 --> 00:50:32.606]  Okay, just like the people, lack of transparency is a huge political advantage.
[00:50:32.606 --> 00:50:40.091]  And basically, you know, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically that was really, really critical to getting the thing to pass.
[00:50:40.091 --> 00:50:42.052]  Yeah, like you want to attack when somebody's asleep.
[00:50:43.806 --> 00:50:51.139]  Or, exactly, or like if you're carjacking somebody, you want to do it at night and nobody's around, and you don't, you want to get them when they're distracted.
[00:50:51.139 --> 00:50:55.045]  That's just, you know, it's an advantage to attack somebody from behind, yeah.
[00:50:55.045 --> 00:50:57.089]  These are the professors running the country, okay?
[00:50:59.164 --> 00:51:03.906]  This hour of GCN programming is proudly sponsored by BlocketPocket.com.

[00:51:14.105 --> 00:51:16.447]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources.
[00:51:16.447 --> 00:51:21.130]  Is it time to convert paper 401ks and IRAs to solid gold and silver yet?

[00:51:26.334 --> 00:51:31.658]  Are you ready to surrender your right to buy body armor?
[00:51:31.658 --> 00:51:32.418]  No joke.
[00:51:32.418 --> 00:51:35.120]  Congress is now trying to outlaw civilian body armor.
[00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:36.381]  And if House Bill H.R.
[00:51:36.601 --> 00:51:42.203]  If 5344 becomes law, you can kiss your right to protect yourself against rifle bullets goodbye.
[00:51:42.203 --> 00:51:45.004]  Don't put off your body armor purchase any longer.
[00:51:45.004 --> 00:51:47.506]  Go now to infidelbodyarmor.com.
[00:51:47.506 --> 00:51:51.427]  Thousands of military veterans trust their lives to Infidel Body Armor.
[00:51:51.427 --> 00:51:52.548]  You should too.
[00:51:52.548 --> 00:51:55.509]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L.
[00:51:55.509 --> 00:51:56.949]  Infidel Body Armor.
[00:51:56.949 --> 00:51:58.070]  Just won't quit.
[00:51:58.470 --> 00:52:02.654]  There may be a hidden danger lurking in our homes and surroundings.
[00:52:02.654 --> 00:52:05.417]  Without the right equipment, you'll never know it's there.
[00:52:05.417 --> 00:52:13.164]  Natural and man-made nuclear radiation can find its way into our living environment, and maser instruments are your best line of defense.
[00:52:13.544 --> 00:52:22.608]  Unlike lower-cost products, Maser Instruments detects all forms of nuclear radiation, including alpha, beta, gamma, and x-rays.
[00:52:22.608 --> 00:52:28.431]  Most products require you manually turn them on for each use, but Maser Instruments are different.
[00:52:28.971 --> 00:52:29.731]  We're good to go.
[00:52:58.581 --> 00:52:59.401]  This is Dan Pilla.
[00:52:59.401 --> 00:53:01.182]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[00:53:01.182 --> 00:53:02.823]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[00:53:02.823 --> 00:53:05.665]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[00:53:05.665 --> 00:53:07.946]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[00:53:07.946 --> 00:53:12.449]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[00:53:12.449 --> 00:53:16.411]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[00:53:16.411 --> 00:53:20.173]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[00:53:20.173 --> 00:53:20.493]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX.
[00:53:20.493 --> 00:53:22.234]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[00:53:27.611 --> 00:53:31.292]  Genesis is defined as an origin, creation, or the beginning.

[00:53:54.379 --> 00:53:54.579]  GCN!
[00:54:06.525 --> 00:54:12.171]  I was called by the New York Times, I was called by the LA Times, I was called by New York Magazine.
[00:54:14.289 --> 00:54:22.834]  And a bunch of others in the last few years, as they were doing searches, I found out why, they were wondering how he kept breaking big stories.
[00:54:22.834 --> 00:54:29.117]  And also, Rob Dues' nickname is Ducifer, because he used to yell at some of the TV crew.
[00:54:29.117 --> 00:54:32.319]  I mean, he's really nice, but you know, he would gripe at them.
[00:54:32.319 --> 00:54:40.743]  So, Marcos Morales started calling him Ducifer and put a name tag on his desk that said Ducifer.
[00:54:40.743 --> 00:54:43.545]  And so, a couple times they would ask me, and who's Ducifer?
[00:54:44.650 --> 00:54:48.152]  Because I'd said that on air and it had been in transcripts and I said, that's what I'll do.
[00:54:48.152 --> 00:54:51.753]  And I had to explain, no, I'm not Guccifer.
[00:54:51.753 --> 00:54:54.695]  Well, Guccifer has gone public.
[00:54:54.695 --> 00:54:58.336]  And Paul Watts has got a video report up on InfoWars.com.
[00:54:58.336 --> 00:55:00.537]  He's going to be joining us in the next hour.
[00:55:00.537 --> 00:55:02.538]  This just broke.
[00:55:02.538 --> 00:55:05.640]  When I saw this report during the break, it sent chills down my spine.
[00:55:06.621 --> 00:55:09.722]  Because you know about the missing nukes out of Dyess Air Force Base.
[00:55:09.722 --> 00:55:14.243]  Within days of us saying that, Lindsey Graham said prepare for the East Coast to be nuked.
[00:55:14.243 --> 00:55:15.343]  That was in CBS News.
[00:55:15.343 --> 00:55:17.544]  I mean, that really did happen.
[00:55:17.544 --> 00:55:22.125]  You notice the base never, when it was in newspapers and stuff, us saying it, never responded.
[00:55:22.125 --> 00:55:24.306]  And said that's ridiculous.
[00:55:24.306 --> 00:55:24.626]  Because...
[00:55:26.141 --> 00:55:28.002]  There was a big scene with the base security.
[00:55:28.002 --> 00:55:29.743]  They said, you gotta sign for this.
[00:55:29.743 --> 00:55:31.403]  There's not even supposed to be nukes here.
[00:55:31.403 --> 00:55:33.304]  Where are these 18-wheelers going?
[00:55:33.304 --> 00:55:37.506]  And the base commander came out and did a written order and said, stand down.
[00:55:37.506 --> 00:55:41.288]  And the police, because they had private police there, almost didn't do it.
[00:55:41.288 --> 00:55:43.709]  Because the military was freaking out.
[00:55:43.709 --> 00:55:50.072]  I mean, do you really think we want to just break stuff like that and it's not true?
[00:55:50.072 --> 00:55:54.874]  Well, Guccifer has hacked a lot of top people.
[00:55:54.874 --> 00:55:55.555]  And the word is,
[00:55:56.837 --> 00:56:01.759]  Guccifer hacked into, and the plan is to nuke Chicago.
[00:56:01.759 --> 00:56:08.422]  Now, it's funny, because I remember seeing it on CNN.
[00:56:08.422 --> 00:56:11.163]  He did this before 9-11, but also after.
[00:56:11.163 --> 00:56:20.827]  Gary Hart and Warren Rudman of the Hart-Rudman Commission of the Council on Foreign Relations was on television.
[00:56:20.827 --> 00:56:22.067]  I think it was CNN.
[00:56:22.067 --> 00:56:22.928]  We've got to find that clip.
[00:56:24.716 --> 00:56:31.000]  Chicago, Dallas, Cleveland, and Denver will be nuked by terrorists.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:35.982]  And then it was like a weird message out to everybody, and they do this.
[00:56:35.982 --> 00:56:45.308]  Just like he sent that letter to Ahmadinejad saying, yeah, we staged 9-11, and we'll stage other stuff and blame it on you, and then published it in the Huffington Post.
[00:56:45.308 --> 00:56:46.348]  It was thinly veiled.
[00:56:46.348 --> 00:56:49.330]  He said, you know, we staged stuff, the main, things like that.
[00:56:49.330 --> 00:56:51.871]  Don't think we won't attack you just because the public's against it.
[00:56:51.871 --> 00:56:52.712]  You better do what we say.
[00:56:54.212 --> 00:56:55.372]  And Iran pretty much did.
[00:56:55.372 --> 00:57:03.355]  So see, for whatever reason, you know Larry Silverstein went and bought the Sears Tower and all that.
[00:57:03.355 --> 00:57:08.937]  We were on two affiliates in Chicago.
[00:57:08.937 --> 00:57:14.038]  There's major indicators they're going to hit Chicago.
[00:57:14.038 --> 00:57:15.239]  And I don't know when.
[00:57:15.239 --> 00:57:17.979]  I've told you about a nuclear false flag to bring in martial law.
[00:57:17.979 --> 00:57:18.540]  This is a big deal.
[00:57:18.540 --> 00:57:19.700]  We're going to talk to Watson about it.
[00:57:20.655 --> 00:57:21.475]  Talk to Watson about her.
[00:57:21.475 --> 00:57:23.056]  I'll play his report bare minimum.
[00:57:23.056 --> 00:57:23.676]  Start next hour.
[00:57:23.676 --> 00:57:26.457]  We'll go to your phone calls as well.
[00:57:26.457 --> 00:57:28.137]  What a job, I tell you.
[00:57:28.137 --> 00:57:35.039]  Before we go any further... That's so sensational, but it's all true.
[00:57:35.039 --> 00:57:38.740]  I just wish reality wasn't so incredibly dangerous.
[00:57:38.740 --> 00:57:39.601]  And they might hit Austin.
[00:57:39.601 --> 00:57:41.741]  You never know where they're gonna hit.
[00:57:41.741 --> 00:57:47.023]  Before I go any further... I'm not gonna get into it.
[00:57:48.379 --> 00:57:50.741]  We are selling out of Survival Shield X2.
[00:57:50.741 --> 00:57:53.624]  It'll probably be sold out in a week, maybe three or four weeks until we get more in.
[00:57:53.624 --> 00:57:59.289]  The nascent iodine, the turbochargers, myself and my family, and you've heard the rave reviews.
[00:57:59.289 --> 00:58:01.491]  We've still got it 10% off with the biodefense pack.
[00:58:01.491 --> 00:58:02.912]  I'm just going to offer it until it sells out.
[00:58:02.912 --> 00:58:04.894]  Then that special will be gone.
[00:58:04.894 --> 00:58:06.976]  We're selling out basically of everything.
[00:58:06.976 --> 00:58:11.741]  We do have more of the Coil Silver and Occupower that was out for three months, four months.
[00:58:11.741 --> 00:58:12.341]  That's back.
[00:58:12.341 --> 00:58:12.681]  Excellent.
[00:58:13.382 --> 00:58:15.463]  It's basically like the poor man's DNA force.
[00:58:15.463 --> 00:58:17.904]  It just does so much, not just for the eyes, other cells.
[00:58:17.904 --> 00:58:20.686]  OcuPower, one of the strongest, best formulas out there.
[00:58:20.686 --> 00:58:25.749]  OxyPowder is sold out, but only for two days, so it's officially not sold out.
[00:58:25.749 --> 00:58:27.109]  We've got a whole bunch of other products.
[00:58:27.109 --> 00:58:28.810]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:58:28.810 --> 00:58:30.451]  Infowarslife.com.

[00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:45.047]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:49.202 --> 00:58:58.866]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super-oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[00:58:58.866 --> 00:59:08.791]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new oxy powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[00:59:08.791 --> 00:59:11.712]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[00:59:11.912 --> 00:59:12.192]  I think?
[00:59:26.909 --> 00:59:28.129]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:04.898 --> 01:00:09.741]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.741 --> 01:00:11.302]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.302 --> 01:00:12.863]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.863 --> 01:00:17.065]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.065 --> 01:00:21.788]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.788 --> 01:00:23.909]  I know it's Guccifer.
[01:00:23.909 --> 01:00:26.451]  I'm an accused of being Guccifer and called by...
[01:00:27.811 --> 01:00:30.112]  New York Magazine, New York Times, you name it.
[01:00:30.112 --> 01:00:33.374]  And then you think I know how to pronounce it.
[01:00:33.374 --> 01:00:34.995]  I'm from Texas, I butcher stuff.
[01:00:34.995 --> 01:00:38.117]  It's okay.
[01:00:38.117 --> 01:00:41.659]  Guccifer.
[01:00:41.659 --> 01:00:44.221]  I just think of Ducifer.
[01:00:44.221 --> 01:00:46.342]  Rob Dues, uh, nickname.
[01:00:46.342 --> 01:00:51.485]  Uh, Paul Watson's article's up there, Top Hacker Chicago Nuke Attack Plan for 2015.
[01:00:51.485 --> 01:00:54.126]  Huge news.
[01:00:54.126 --> 01:00:56.528]  And folks say, uh, in the comments,
[01:00:58.559 --> 01:01:00.060]  No, take Detroit instead.
[01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:01.862]  Detroit is considered a dead already.
[01:01:01.862 --> 01:01:02.702]  Chicago's suffering.
[01:01:02.702 --> 01:01:03.863]  You can see the reasoning there, yeah.
[01:01:03.863 --> 01:01:12.269]  For whatever reason, that's the intel keeps coming out in the chatter.
[01:01:12.269 --> 01:01:16.252]  Michael D'Angelo says Chicago's definitely the city I wouldn't mind getting nuked.
[01:01:16.252 --> 01:01:23.557]  Maybe we should open the phones up for Chicagoans and say, what do you think of Guccifer, the top hacker who keeps leaking incredibly classified stuff?
[01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:27.961]  Coming out and saying that he's gone through high-level people's intel.
[01:01:27.961 --> 01:01:32.162]  That's the plan.
[01:01:32.162 --> 01:01:45.664]  All I know is we got a panic communique by high-level folks at Dias saying they brought out nukes hidden in the hangars.
[01:01:45.664 --> 01:01:47.125]  They loaded them on 18-wheelers.
[01:01:47.125 --> 01:01:50.825]  The police with other officers said, where's the authorization?
[01:01:50.825 --> 01:01:53.386]  They wouldn't sign paperwork so the police wouldn't let them leave.
[01:01:55.492 --> 01:02:00.194]  The base commander came out and said, let him go.
[01:02:00.194 --> 01:02:02.995]  And then the media, TV stations, radio called that base.
[01:02:02.995 --> 01:02:11.758]  Dyess would never deny it.
[01:02:11.758 --> 01:02:18.020]  And then you saw all hell break loose about nukes hitting the East Coast right where we said they were taking them.
[01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:20.501]  Look, this is above my pay grade.
[01:02:20.501 --> 01:02:22.161]  But let me give you another little news flash.
[01:02:22.161 --> 01:02:23.602]  It's above anybody's pay grade.
[01:02:25.623 --> 01:02:26.904]  Let's go to one phone call now.
[01:02:26.904 --> 01:02:28.465]  We'll go to Watson for about five, six minutes.
[01:02:28.465 --> 01:02:29.646]  Then we'll go to everybody else.
[01:02:29.646 --> 01:02:32.789]  Joe, Richard, Tony, Ryan, Wesley, and others.
[01:02:32.789 --> 01:02:36.752]  Joe in Nevada, go ahead.
[01:02:36.752 --> 01:02:38.373]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:02:38.373 --> 01:02:39.174]  I'm doing good, brother.
[01:02:39.174 --> 01:02:42.297]  What do you think about all this crazy news?
[01:02:42.297 --> 01:02:50.443]  Oh man, that video of that creepy guy talking yesterday about making everyone sick and doing it on purpose and making us broke is pretty crazy.
[01:02:53.421 --> 01:03:01.206]  Well, that's not just a creepy guy, that's one of the main Obama architects of the screwjob known as Obamacare.
[01:03:01.206 --> 01:03:02.747]  Oh yeah, I've been spreading that out.
[01:03:02.747 --> 01:03:06.089]  Most people have never seen that.
[01:03:06.089 --> 01:03:07.749]  It's pretty wild.
[01:03:07.749 --> 01:03:12.552]  I wanted to talk with you real quick about freedom of the press and the work you guys are doing.
[01:03:12.552 --> 01:03:15.554]  I wanted to say I'm praying for you and your whole crew.
[01:03:18.090 --> 01:03:30.356]  I really never understood the depth of the freedom of press until I really see what you guys are doing and you're sending your people into hairy situations and I want to tell you that me and my family are praying for you guys.
[01:03:32.303 --> 01:03:41.931]  I was out actually at the Bundy Ranch and I saw Josh and David Knight out there and I can't tell you how much it touched me that you are sending your people out there.
[01:03:41.931 --> 01:03:47.095]  And you know, to know that people were going to see what happened that day.
[01:03:47.095 --> 01:03:54.261]  There was two reporters there, I mean, and you guys were one of them and I just really want to thank you for that.
[01:03:54.261 --> 01:03:55.122]  It was very important.
[01:03:57.495 --> 01:04:00.701]  And also about GMO labeling.
[01:04:00.701 --> 01:04:02.645]  I have some thoughts on that.
[01:04:02.645 --> 01:04:07.193]  I don't know if you... I'm a small farmer from Nevada basically.
[01:04:07.999 --> 01:04:19.123]  And I understand the movement for labeling and things of that nature, but I think... You're saying it'll put undue costs on you having to prove and certify everything.
[01:04:19.123 --> 01:04:33.368]  That's kind of the fear-mongering I've seen, because I've got family that are farmers as well, and it'll just be the co-ops or where you sell it through, then the private certifiers will go out, and then they'll certify that it's organic.
[01:04:33.368 --> 01:04:35.149]  But, I mean, finish your point, sorry.
[01:04:37.007 --> 01:04:41.229]  My point is I truly, truly trust in the free market.
[01:04:41.229 --> 01:04:47.572]  And I think that as the ambassador of the free market, I really think that we should be about repealing.
[01:04:47.572 --> 01:04:55.817]  That money would be really well spent repealing what we can't say, rather than trying to make someone put a label on what you can already find out already.
[01:04:55.817 --> 01:04:56.437]  Well, I agree.
[01:04:56.437 --> 01:04:57.758]  I mean, people should just label it.
[01:04:58.977 --> 01:05:00.977]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[01:05:00.977 --> 01:05:05.498]  When cells become toxic, they die early, and aging sets in.
[01:05:05.498 --> 01:05:09.959]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[01:05:09.959 --> 01:05:17.260]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[01:05:17.260 --> 01:05:26.362]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:05:26.562 --> 01:05:32.104]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.
[01:05:32.104 --> 01:05:39.688]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed-listed published studies.

[01:06:28.692 --> 01:06:32.355]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:06:32.355 --> 01:06:36.619]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:06:36.619 --> 01:06:38.400]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:43.745]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[01:06:43.745 --> 01:06:46.267]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.
[01:06:46.267 --> 01:06:47.408]  But for how long?

[01:07:10.851 --> 01:07:17.995]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the InfoWarsLife line because they are not of the very highest quality.
[01:07:18.015 --> 01:07:18.635]  We're good to go.
[01:07:38.783 --> 01:07:48.908]  That all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited Infowarslife.com and believed in us and tried the products.

[01:08:01.294 --> 01:08:04.055]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:04.055 --> 01:08:06.857]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:13.891 --> 01:08:19.315]  Well, this news is so incredibly important that I'm going to move the author of Dr. Mary's Monkey.
[01:08:19.315 --> 01:08:20.716]  This is very important as well.
[01:08:20.716 --> 01:08:24.599]  Weaponized cancer declassified in the vaccines.
[01:08:24.599 --> 01:08:29.222]  We're going to move him to another day for full hour or the nightly news.
[01:08:29.222 --> 01:08:35.947]  At the end of the last hour, Paul Watson's report broke at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:08:35.947 --> 01:08:36.668]  It's red-linked.
[01:08:38.717 --> 01:08:44.241]  Top hacker, Chicago nuke attack planned for 2015, Guccifer.
[01:08:44.241 --> 01:08:52.067]  Now to be clear, I've been contacted to show how I've been connected to this just by the media's research, even though I'm not connected to it.
[01:08:52.067 --> 01:09:08.179]  We've been contacted by LA Times, New York Times, New York Daily News, New York Magazine, for some reason all the New York outfits, Rolling Stone again, and a bunch of others wanting to talk to me about Guccifer.
[01:09:10.433 --> 01:09:14.436]  And basically saying, well you leak a lot of stuff, you have a lot of breaking stuff.
[01:09:14.436 --> 01:09:18.319]  Are you Guccifer or is he giving you info or is she giving you info?
[01:09:18.319 --> 01:09:25.944]  We don't know who, or didn't know, now of course more of it's known, who Guccifer is.
[01:09:25.944 --> 01:09:29.007]  But it's one of the top hackers in the world.
[01:09:29.007 --> 01:09:36.772]  We've had Captain Crunch on who's a listener, and he's the top granddaddy hacker, but he's not currently the top hacker.
[01:09:36.772 --> 01:09:39.214]  And Guccifer has been very credible.
[01:09:46.348 --> 01:09:49.972]  And so Paul Watson filed this three-minute report.
[01:09:49.972 --> 01:09:52.654]  We're going to play it, then go to Paul Watson in London.
[01:09:52.654 --> 01:10:06.529]  But I want to remind you, and we'll go to a document cam shot here for TV viewers, that back in September of last year, we broke this news.
[01:10:06.529 --> 01:10:09.492]  Dias refuses to deny secret nuke transfer.
[01:10:12.372 --> 01:10:18.376]  Dias officially responds to secret nuke transfer, refuses to deny.
[01:10:18.376 --> 01:10:23.860]  And it's right down the road from the big company that is the only company in the U.S.
[01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:29.304]  that demilitarizes them, deactivates them, Pantex.
[01:10:29.304 --> 01:10:33.528]  But they weren't going to Pantex, they were going to Lindsey Graham's district.
[01:10:33.528 --> 01:10:37.731]  Within hours of his breaking this, Graham comes out on CBS News and says a nuke attack
[01:10:38.917 --> 01:10:46.022]  is imminent in the Carolinas, or in Georgia, or in New York.
[01:10:46.022 --> 01:10:48.944]  Exclusive high-level source confirms secret U.S.
[01:10:48.944 --> 01:10:53.547]  nuclear warhead transfer off the books to Obama.
[01:10:53.547 --> 01:10:56.669]  Senator Grant warms of nuke strike after missing warhead report.
[01:10:56.669 --> 01:10:59.030]  You can go read the CBS report in our story.
[01:10:59.030 --> 01:11:00.411]  Watch the video.
[01:11:00.411 --> 01:11:03.273]  In fact, if you scroll down for TV viewers, there's the CBS article.
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:10.081]  By the way, they went and changed the article about a day later.
[01:11:10.081 --> 01:11:16.983]  They do a lot of that now.
[01:11:16.983 --> 01:11:22.805]  So, I don't know exactly what's going on, but we've played the clip before.
[01:11:22.805 --> 01:11:25.987]  Somebody could probably find it.
[01:11:25.987 --> 01:11:30.448]  He said it on CNN.
[01:11:30.448 --> 01:11:32.869]  And he said a similar thing on Fox.
[01:11:32.869 --> 01:11:34.870]  The head of the Hart-Rubin Commission, Gary Hart,
[01:11:36.138 --> 01:11:46.865]  said, and remember before 9-11, and we played this clip at Nauseam, he basically said a huge terror attack is coming and it's going to change the way we live our lives.
[01:11:46.865 --> 01:11:57.052]  Once it happened, he said on C-SPAN we need to use this disaster to bring in what President Bush's father called for, a new world order, and make lemonade out of these lemons.
[01:11:57.052 --> 01:12:03.397]  Well he said Dallas, Cleveland, Chicago, and Denver would be hit by terrorist nuke.
[01:12:05.498 --> 01:12:13.740]  And we see preparations in the brainwashing of the military and police that patriots in the military might get nukes and detonate them.
[01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:33.024]  And then we see shows like Jericho, where a private security company like Halliburton, or groups like it, I guess you'd say something like XZ, formerly Blackwater, does it to bring in martial law.
[01:12:33.024 --> 01:12:34.964]  Post-apocalyptic action drama series.
[01:12:36.536 --> 01:12:38.137]  Aired on CBS from 2006-2008.
[01:12:38.137 --> 01:12:40.538]  So this is out there.
[01:12:40.538 --> 01:12:44.220]  But when you hear us talk about it, it's not coming from conjecture.
[01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:46.101]  It's coming from high-level sources.
[01:12:46.101 --> 01:12:49.202]  Now remember, we first reported this.
[01:12:49.202 --> 01:12:51.724]  People didn't believe it.
[01:12:51.724 --> 01:12:52.724]  It was in the local news.
[01:12:52.724 --> 01:12:53.805]  There was a big fracas.
[01:12:53.805 --> 01:12:57.947]  And then our sources said, Wayne Madsen actually at the time broke it.
[01:12:59.369 --> 01:13:08.158]  That it was missing high-tech cruise missiles, four of them, the media said two, on a B-52 going down to Louisiana.
[01:13:08.158 --> 01:13:14.265]  And we had sources down there that said it was four, welding out a buddy still in the Air Force down there and saw it all happen.
[01:13:17.742 --> 01:13:22.906]  And they were trying to disappear, Cheney was, four high-tech cruise missiles.
[01:13:22.906 --> 01:13:24.527]  So let's get something straight.
[01:13:24.527 --> 01:13:26.268]  There's real smoke here.
[01:13:26.268 --> 01:13:27.069]  That means there's fire.
[01:13:27.069 --> 01:13:29.531]  In fact, I can see fire in the smoke.
[01:13:29.531 --> 01:13:30.992]  I don't know exactly how bad it is.
[01:13:30.992 --> 01:13:33.954]  It's like pulling up to a house fire in a fire department.
[01:13:33.954 --> 01:13:36.856]  You don't know how bad it is until you get inside, generally.
[01:13:36.856 --> 01:13:38.097]  It could explode any minute.
[01:13:38.097 --> 01:13:41.699]  I don't know how bad it is, but it stinks.
[01:13:41.699 --> 01:13:45.102]  And this would be the perfect way to make Obama look like a victim.
[01:13:45.102 --> 01:13:46.623]  His town, his people.
[01:13:49.252 --> 01:13:50.956]  I don't know how big a nuke they would detonate.
[01:13:50.956 --> 01:13:52.519]  We're on two affiliates in Chicago.
[01:13:53.937 --> 01:13:55.799]  I'm not in the business here to scare people.
[01:13:55.799 --> 01:13:58.041]  I'm not the one originating this report.
[01:13:58.041 --> 01:14:04.566]  It's a top hacker who's released hundreds of documented real hacks and is the premier hacker.
[01:14:04.566 --> 01:14:08.009]  Probably a consortium of hackers trying to warn people.
[01:14:08.009 --> 01:14:09.690]  Though they claim it's one guy now.
[01:14:09.690 --> 01:14:10.971]  Let's play Paul Watson's report.
[01:14:10.971 --> 01:14:12.633]  Go to it and then to your phone calls.
[01:14:12.633 --> 01:14:13.734]  And we'll get to your phone calls.
[01:14:13.734 --> 01:14:17.037]  I have moved the guest that was coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:14:17.037 --> 01:14:22.081]  Let's go ahead and go to Paul Watson's report filed just 20 minutes ago at InfoWars.com.
[01:14:23.092 --> 01:14:38.197]  Guccifer, the Romanian hacker who accessed private email accounts of numerous top government and military officials, as well as the Bush family, is quoted in the New York Times as predicting a nuclear attack on Chicago sometime in 2015.
[01:14:38.197 --> 01:14:51.502]  Having eluded the FBI and the Secret Service for years, Guccifer, real name Marcel Lazar, infamously hacked George W. Bush's creepy self-portraits while also accessing email accounts belonging to Colin Powell,
[01:14:52.122 --> 01:14:55.024]  As well as military officers and celebrities.
[01:14:55.024 --> 01:14:59.167]  He is now serving a seven-year prison sentence in Romania.
[01:14:59.167 --> 01:15:14.557]  Explaining the purpose behind his hacking, which was conducted merely by guessing the security answers to people's email accounts to obtain their passwords, Guccifer's manifesto is, quote, a potpourri of conspiracy theories about the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the 1997 death of Princess Diana,
[01:15:18.980 --> 01:15:24.443]  ...and alleged plans for a nuclear attack in Chicago in 2015.
[01:15:24.443 --> 01:15:35.289]  And whether you believe it to be the work of a conspiracy or a plot crafted by a group like ISIS, the fact is that Chicago has been a terror target since 9-11.
[01:15:35.289 --> 01:15:40.492]  Earlier this summer the FBI warned that ISIS were planning to target major US cities.
[01:15:41.192 --> 01:15:49.918]  After the terror group put out a series of chilling tweets identifying the Old Republic building in Chicago as being in the crosshairs.
[01:15:49.918 --> 01:15:55.221]  Guccifer also makes another intriguing comment during the New York Times interview, quote,
[01:16:02.526 --> 01:16:06.267]  Bankers and industrialists from the 19th and 20th century.
[01:16:06.267 --> 01:16:23.372]  Of course, a far cry from the original 18th century Bavarian Illuminati, the modern incarnation largely centers around claims by hip-hop artists and other members of the entertainment industry that they're part of an occult secret elite that controls the planet.
[01:16:23.372 --> 01:16:28.633]  In name-checking the Illuminati, Guccifer is most likely making the general point
[01:16:29.193 --> 01:16:36.637]  That global events are coordinated and managed to some extent by elite banking families just as they have been down the centuries.
[01:16:36.637 --> 01:16:45.082]  But what's your view on Guccifer's comments about the Illuminati and a nuclear attack on Chicago in 2015?
[01:16:45.082 --> 01:16:47.003]  Let me know in the comments below.
[01:16:47.003 --> 01:16:49.324]  Check out the other videos, subscribe to the channel.
[01:16:49.324 --> 01:16:52.106]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson reporting for InfoWars.com.
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:55.661]  All right, let's go now live to London.
[01:16:55.661 --> 01:17:03.645]  We're skipping this network break coming up and at the bottom of the hour I'll go directly to Tony, Richard, Ryan, David, Wesley and others.
[01:17:03.645 --> 01:17:06.666]  I appreciate you guys holding but this is emergency news obviously right here.
[01:17:09.284 --> 01:17:21.591]  You've got the Hart-Rudman Commission that wrote the plan for the post-free America police state with the RAND Corporation on record, saying nukes will hit these cities and that they'll totally take our rights.
[01:17:21.591 --> 01:17:25.613]  As an alert to their own mid-level minions, obviously.
[01:17:25.613 --> 01:17:27.995]  Or you can elaborate on why you think they do it.
[01:17:27.995 --> 01:17:31.397]  Now you've got the missing nukes and just people freaking out at the base.
[01:17:32.005 --> 01:17:33.866]  I mean, there were guns out at Dias, folks.
[01:17:33.866 --> 01:17:35.588]  This was unbelievable.
[01:17:35.588 --> 01:17:36.889]  We've got that going on.
[01:17:36.889 --> 01:17:40.471]  No one ever said we were liars about that, you notice, because it happened.
[01:17:40.471 --> 01:17:42.573]  They might have been dummy nukes or something.
[01:17:42.573 --> 01:17:44.774]  I don't know, but they were told they were nukes.
[01:17:44.774 --> 01:17:47.316]  They weren't going to Pentax.
[01:17:47.316 --> 01:17:59.866]  So, Paul, looking at Guccifer coming out, who did get into all these top people's emails,
[01:18:00.902 --> 01:18:02.383]  I mean, they admitted this was all real.
[01:18:02.383 --> 01:18:03.723]  He really did this, and more.
[01:18:03.723 --> 01:18:07.305]  And I know they claim he's the only person operating under that name.
[01:18:07.305 --> 01:18:09.886]  I don't think that's the case from what I've studied and seen.
[01:18:09.886 --> 01:18:14.949]  Obviously, it's now coming out that Snowden is not one person, but a consortium group.
[01:18:14.949 --> 01:18:17.930]  And I'm not even sure exactly who he's working for, but that's another subject.
[01:18:17.930 --> 01:18:19.671]  This cloak and dagger stuff gets into that.
[01:18:19.671 --> 01:18:24.053]  We're trying to reveal the cloak and dagger to people so that the tricks don't work anymore.
[01:18:24.053 --> 01:18:27.335]  The way to beat this system is to expose it and to bring in a more
[01:18:28.115 --> 01:18:32.779]  Honorable, chivalry-based system, which is more secure for everybody.
[01:18:32.779 --> 01:18:34.801]  True security, true peace, true prosperity.
[01:18:34.801 --> 01:18:38.164]  Paul, what's your gut on all this?
[01:18:38.164 --> 01:18:45.291]  Well, what's interesting about it, Alex, is, you know, it came out in this New York Times article, which came out last night.
[01:18:45.291 --> 01:18:51.757]  They visited the Transylvanian prison in which he's serving this seven-year sentence, and he basically said to them,
[01:18:52.446 --> 01:19:01.571]  Look, before I answer any questions, I'm going to read out this manifesto as to why I did this hacking and what the purpose of it was.
[01:19:01.571 --> 01:19:10.516]  So he obviously expected them, at least to some extent, to reprint some of his manifesto because it was a condition of the interview itself.
[01:19:10.516 --> 01:19:12.357]  That's what it says in the article.
[01:19:12.357 --> 01:19:16.680]  But all they afford to it is one dismissive paragraph.
[01:19:17.279 --> 01:19:25.295]  In which they mention, you know, 9-11, the death of Princess Diana, and the alleged plot plan to attack Chicago with a nuclear weapon in 2015.
[01:19:26.736 --> 01:19:35.922]  So, obviously this was a, and they talk later about how he makes extensive notes about all these plots, which obviously he's garnered some knowledge of.
[01:19:35.922 --> 01:19:39.984]  Yeah, now obviously, this is where people still fall for it.
[01:19:39.984 --> 01:19:45.268]  It's the New York Times, just like Snowden tried to talk to them first, and all they did was cattle on him.
[01:19:45.268 --> 01:19:54.434]  You go to the CIA, you go to the New York Times, that's who they are, you go to the Carney Endowment for Peace, that's really, they're above the CIA, above the State Department, you go to this trust,
[01:19:55.447 --> 01:19:58.289]  And you expect them to then make you credible.
[01:19:58.289 --> 01:20:00.130]  It's the opposite.
[01:20:00.130 --> 01:20:02.952]  And this is how the trolls are.
[01:20:02.952 --> 01:20:07.474]  They're on InfoWars.com freaking out about this right now and on YouTube saying we're liars.
[01:20:07.474 --> 01:20:09.616]  We're reporting on the New York Times.
[01:20:09.616 --> 01:20:11.337]  They're saying we made this up.
[01:20:11.337 --> 01:20:12.397]  See, Paul?
[01:20:12.397 --> 01:20:13.798]  Because they're not really trolls.
[01:20:13.798 --> 01:20:16.079]  We've tracked some of the IP addresses before.
[01:20:16.079 --> 01:20:18.241]  These are coming out of government servers, Paul.
[01:20:18.241 --> 01:20:21.363]  They don't even, and corporate servers, they don't even try to hide it now.
[01:20:21.983 --> 01:20:27.365]  Just like the Obama administration guys saying, you know, the public's dumb, we lie to them, it's their plan to rip them off.
[01:20:27.365 --> 01:20:30.166]  They just hope people are dumb and don't check.
[01:20:30.166 --> 01:20:36.568]  They'll probably say that this, you know, Guccifer guy, or Gucci-fer, doesn't even exist as well.
[01:20:36.568 --> 01:20:43.591]  The point is, this may stop a Chicago nuke attack, and then we don't get thanked for that, or Gucci-fer doesn't get thanked.
[01:20:43.591 --> 01:20:45.972]  Instead, they'll just say he doesn't exist.
[01:20:45.972 --> 01:20:49.453]  But it's only the public being so weak-minded that allows this to happen.
[01:20:50.868 --> 01:20:54.011]  Well, I mean, the screenshot from the New York Times is in the video.
[01:20:54.011 --> 01:20:57.894]  I will add it to the article with the link to the New York Times, though.
[01:20:57.894 --> 01:21:00.157]  That's not good enough.
[01:21:00.157 --> 01:21:03.059]  Look, I'll just call you racist and that'll shut you down.
[01:21:03.059 --> 01:21:03.820]  I don't need facts.
[01:21:03.820 --> 01:21:05.421]  I don't need to be intellectual.
[01:21:05.421 --> 01:21:07.003]  Racist.
[01:21:07.003 --> 01:21:08.564]  That's gonna do it.
[01:21:08.564 --> 01:21:10.526]  Yeah, I just need to know one word.
[01:21:10.526 --> 01:21:11.167]  Sorry, Paul, go ahead.
[01:21:12.933 --> 01:21:16.757]  But again, the concern is he's had access to the emails.
[01:21:16.757 --> 01:21:29.854]  Rockefeller family, Bush family, Council on Foreign Relations, FBI, Secret Service, aides to Bill Clinton, George Tenet, Richard Armitage, John Negroponte, the list goes on and on.
[01:21:30.414 --> 01:21:33.736]  Secret Service Romanian intelligence, that's where he was arrested.
[01:21:33.736 --> 01:21:43.102]  He breaks in, he has the intel, he gives it to them, and they don't want the story of the century with a confirmed hacker that's leaked nothing but truth.
[01:21:43.102 --> 01:21:47.085]  No, it's just, aha, he says Chicago's gonna get nuked.
[01:21:47.085 --> 01:21:50.167]  Yeah, it's dismissed in a sentence, it's completely ridiculous.
[01:21:50.894 --> 01:21:54.918]  I mean, that's why we exist, to pick up on that kind of thing and make it into a story.
[01:21:54.918 --> 01:22:01.345]  Just like Forbes last week goes, yeah, we're in a meeting with the media, with the CDC, we're supposed to cover up what appears to be Ebola cases.
[01:22:01.345 --> 01:22:09.232]  You know, Gucciardi went up to Dallas, Paul, and talked to more doctors, and they're like, oh yeah, this is definitely going on, they're covering up Ebola cases.
[01:22:09.232 --> 01:22:14.217]  And they're scared, they go, we don't like covering it up because we're going to be liable, we think the government will leave us holding the bag.
[01:22:15.083 --> 01:22:21.467]  Now, I'm not saying it's pandemic and we're all dead, but clearly, Paul, there is Ebola here and there and they're covering it up.
[01:22:21.467 --> 01:22:26.011]  I mean, it's not fun to live in a country where the media and everybody goes along with lies.
[01:22:26.011 --> 01:22:29.173]  This is not making us secure, it's making us insecure, Paul.
[01:22:30.089 --> 01:22:32.170]  And we're not even going to know if they are covering it up.
[01:22:32.170 --> 01:22:32.931]  To what extent?
[01:22:32.931 --> 01:22:36.232]  Because the media has agreed not to report on any of the cases.
[01:22:36.232 --> 01:22:39.294]  There's actually a flight that went out of Gran Canaria.
[01:22:39.294 --> 01:22:45.357]  Remember when those Ebola, potentially Ebola victims, they had Ebola symptoms, washed up on a beach in Gran Canaria.
[01:22:45.357 --> 01:22:47.258]  These African illegal immigrants.
[01:22:47.258 --> 01:22:48.679]  They were just dumped out on the beach.
[01:22:48.679 --> 01:22:49.620]  Everybody freaked out.
[01:22:49.620 --> 01:22:51.841]  Yeah, vomiting with blood running out their errands, yeah.
[01:22:52.731 --> 01:22:58.356]  Yeah, turns out there was a flight that went from Gran Canaria, I think it was to Andrews Air Force Base.
[01:22:58.356 --> 01:23:04.142]  I'm looking into that now, if that was a secret transfer for potential treatment of Ebola victims.
[01:23:04.142 --> 01:23:08.366]  Which if it's the case, the media's not going to report on it because they've been sworn to secrecy.
[01:23:10.626 --> 01:23:11.767]  All right, get back into the nukes.
[01:23:11.767 --> 01:23:15.329]  I've been interrupting you because this gets me so upset and so excited in a bad way.
[01:23:15.329 --> 01:23:28.357]  Start over, Paul, with, again, for folks that just joined us, New York Times meets, gets what's in the emails of the world elite, Rockefellers, you name it, nukes Chicago, and the idiots at the New York Times just think it's all a big joke.
[01:23:29.605 --> 01:23:37.710]  Yeah, this is Gucifer, or Guccifer, who was a hacker for several years, very prominent over the past several years, out of Transylvania.
[01:23:37.710 --> 01:23:39.191]  He lived in Romania.
[01:23:39.191 --> 01:23:41.973]  He hacked into the personal email accounts.
[01:23:41.973 --> 01:23:43.254]  Technically, he didn't even hack.
[01:23:43.254 --> 01:23:46.776]  He gathered information from the internet and guessed the passwords.
[01:23:46.776 --> 01:23:50.598]  So he wasn't even breaking some of those hacking laws.
[01:23:50.598 --> 01:23:54.561]  Obviously, he got in illegally, but he just guessed the security answers and the passwords.
[01:23:55.181 --> 01:23:56.022]  Bush family.
[01:23:56.022 --> 01:23:59.626]  He was the guy who released the Bush self-portraits.
[01:23:59.626 --> 01:24:12.659]  He also hacked the Rockefeller family, members of the Council on Foreign Relations, aides to Bill Clinton, FBI Secret Service members, George Tenet, former CIA, Richard Armitage, John Negroponte.
[01:24:12.659 --> 01:24:14.260]  So he hacked all these accounts.
[01:24:14.260 --> 01:24:17.364]  There's actually a scandal with Colin Powell who he also hacked.
[01:24:17.944 --> 01:24:27.932]  Where this Romanian politician was sending nude photos of herself to Colin Powell so he had to come out and admit that he'd been hacked and then deny that he was having an affair with her.
[01:24:27.932 --> 01:24:30.654]  So this was all confirmed that he was getting into these accounts.
[01:24:30.654 --> 01:24:33.397]  He was arrested in Romania back in January.
[01:24:33.397 --> 01:24:37.680]  He was indicted in abstentia in Virginia back in June.
[01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:39.962]  Now he's in prison for seven years in Romania.
[01:24:40.894 --> 01:24:52.281]  He came out to the New York Times and said, look, I'll do an interview with you, but only if you print this manifesto, this long manifesto that he read out before he agreed to any questions.
[01:24:52.281 --> 01:24:58.565]  In that manifesto was alleged plot to attack Chicago with a nuclear weapon in 2015.
[01:25:00.908 --> 01:25:11.871]  But it was dismissed by the New York Times in a paragraph as some kind of paranoid conspiracy theory alongside the death of Princess Diana and 9-11.
[01:25:11.871 --> 01:25:13.711]  Let me say this to Guccifer.
[01:25:13.711 --> 01:25:15.012]  We want your manifesto.
[01:25:15.012 --> 01:25:16.692]  We will print it in whole.
[01:25:16.692 --> 01:25:19.453]  Infowars.com is ready.
[01:25:19.453 --> 01:25:23.274]  I know they probably aren't letting him get info out because they're all scared of what he's got.
[01:25:24.380 --> 01:25:28.663]  You know, we've got Romanian listeners that have sent us Bilderberg footage and stuff from Istanbul, Turkey.
[01:25:28.663 --> 01:25:32.185]  In fact, we have that guy's phone number.
[01:25:32.185 --> 01:25:32.965]  Jacobson has it.
[01:25:32.965 --> 01:25:38.228]  We ought to get a hold of our Romanian sources and deputize them as a reporter and send them in if he can get in.
[01:25:38.228 --> 01:25:43.011]  Of course, they may have only let the New York Times in to see him because they knew he'd spin it.
[01:25:43.011 --> 01:25:44.492]  This is outrageous, Paul.
[01:25:44.492 --> 01:25:45.833]  Paul, you want to get on a plane?
[01:25:45.833 --> 01:25:46.854]  I'll pay for it.
[01:25:46.854 --> 01:25:48.194]  You ready to go to Transylvania, buddy?
[01:25:48.194 --> 01:25:48.875]  They say it's beautiful.
[01:25:50.615 --> 01:25:52.576]  Maybe that's something we can talk about.
[01:25:52.576 --> 01:25:54.037]  You're only three hours away.
[01:25:54.037 --> 01:25:54.578]  Saddle up.
[01:25:54.578 --> 01:25:55.978]  Let's go.
[01:25:55.978 --> 01:26:09.807]  But the only thing they actually printed out of his manifesto was the quote, this world is run by a group of conspirators called the Council of Illuminati, very rich people, noble families, bankers and industrialists from the 19th and 20th century.
[01:26:09.807 --> 01:26:11.868]  So they reprinted that part of it.
[01:26:11.868 --> 01:26:14.370]  Then later on, they talk about him making extensive
[01:26:15.377 --> 01:26:19.580]  Filling notebooks with conspiracy theories in small, neat handwritings.
[01:26:19.580 --> 01:26:26.865]  So he's obviously writing down everything that he learned through these emails and they're dismissing it as paranoid conspiracy theories.
[01:26:26.865 --> 01:26:31.328]  Well obviously the police seized all the copies of the stuff.
[01:26:31.328 --> 01:26:39.493]  I mean, Guccifer released the paintings of Bush and him in the bathtub and more, so they've got the intel.
[01:26:39.493 --> 01:26:41.855]  And so the good news is we know about the Chicago nuke plan.
[01:26:42.965 --> 01:26:47.307]  Uh, they think we're so dumb they had Hart brag about it ten years ago.
[01:26:47.307 --> 01:26:53.149]  So, how many times have I said I think Chicago's the major false flag target with a nuke, Paul?
[01:26:53.149 --> 01:26:53.609]  How many times?
[01:26:53.609 --> 01:26:56.810]  Uh, numerous times.
[01:26:56.810 --> 01:27:04.612]  In fact, I think there was a plot involving a terrorist to attack a building in Chicago, but the building wasn't even built when the plot was supposed to happen.
[01:27:04.612 --> 01:27:06.873]  So, it's been in the works for a while.
[01:27:06.873 --> 01:27:09.294]  Of course, if it happened, they'd probably blame it.
[01:27:10.049 --> 01:27:22.659]  On somebody like ISIS, because we had these stories from back in August about ISIS tweeting pictures of threats made against Chicago buildings, like the Old Republic building, which is in Chicago.
[01:27:22.659 --> 01:27:32.748]  There was another story this year, again in August, a man arrested for making bomb threat in Chicago after he flew an ISIS flag from his car and led police on a chase.
[01:27:33.508 --> 01:27:44.135]  So, you know, whether it's going to be by ISIS or blamed on ISIS or Patsy's or whatever, as he said, definitely Chicago has been a big target since at least 9-11.
[01:27:44.135 --> 01:27:44.695]  That's right.
[01:27:44.695 --> 01:27:53.461]  We're putting the CBS News story up about the ISIS plan is being protected by, you know who, the criminal globalists running our government.
[01:27:53.461 --> 01:27:54.362]  It's just a fact.
[01:27:54.362 --> 01:28:02.487]  But this also goes to David Rockefeller, Colin Powell, all these top
[01:28:03.755 --> 01:28:05.697]  Gangsters.
[01:28:05.697 --> 01:28:07.378]  Sure, they're in control of things.
[01:28:07.378 --> 01:28:10.420]  They've got all these super weapons.
[01:28:10.420 --> 01:28:14.043]  They've had all these scientists build them all this, but they don't know how to run it all.
[01:28:14.043 --> 01:28:18.987]  They're too lazy not to have nonsense passcodes that nobody can figure out.
[01:28:18.987 --> 01:28:22.390]  I mean, I'm not a tech guy, but I don't use names.
[01:28:22.390 --> 01:28:27.294]  It's scrambled, uppercase, lowercase, you know, gibberish symbols.
[01:28:27.294 --> 01:28:28.135]  But they're lazy.
[01:28:28.795 --> 01:28:36.956]  I mean, obviously, these people don't uphold any security, any preparations, because they think everyone's totally dumb.
[01:28:36.956 --> 01:28:38.097]  But so what?
[01:28:38.097 --> 01:28:40.297]  10-15% are super smart!
[01:28:40.297 --> 01:28:48.459]  So they're operating as if all the 7 million people are idiots, when there's probably like 500 million people that are as smart as they are.
[01:28:48.459 --> 01:28:50.319]  We're just not psychopaths.
[01:28:50.319 --> 01:28:56.140]  So I don't know how they... That shows how all the other technologies and things they've got... We're all in danger, folks.
[01:28:56.940 --> 01:29:02.465]  They're green lighting, open air, pharmacological crops that scientists say will probably kill everybody.
[01:29:02.465 --> 01:29:14.415]  You know, HIV in corn, hepatitis in corn, super funguses that could spread to the atmosphere and make interstellar a real reality.
[01:29:14.415 --> 01:29:17.858]  The Andromeda strain a real reality.
[01:29:17.858 --> 01:29:20.300]  I just shudder at how bad these people are, Paul.
[01:29:21.974 --> 01:29:28.238]  Well, and the point with the passwords, because we had the story last week about the security cameras across the world.
[01:29:28.238 --> 01:29:31.180]  Most people never bothered to change the default password.
[01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:33.862]  So it's like, you know, admin and then password.
[01:29:33.862 --> 01:29:44.289]  So this website has set up direct access to people's bedrooms and living rooms with these private security cameras across the world because people failed to change their password.
[01:29:44.289 --> 01:29:46.190]  That's right, was it 300,000 cameras or something?
[01:29:46.190 --> 01:29:46.550]  Just so far?
[01:29:46.550 --> 01:29:47.631]  Yeah, in every country.
[01:29:47.631 --> 01:29:48.612]  Yeah, thank you Paul, great job.
[01:29:48.612 --> 01:29:49.653]  We're on the march.
[01:29:49.653 --> 01:29:50.353]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:50.353 --> 01:29:50.853]  We'll keep watching it.
[01:29:52.175 --> 01:29:54.862]  Alex Jones articles on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:54.862 --> 01:29:56.386]  Let me tie it into the missing notes.
[01:29:59.287 --> 01:30:08.931]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[01:30:08.931 --> 01:30:18.856]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[01:30:18.856 --> 01:30:21.777]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body.
[01:30:21.997 --> 01:30:22.277]  I think?
[01:30:36.971 --> 01:30:37.211]  We're good.
[01:30:59.031 --> 01:31:05.417]  When I first got online and I seen the price of the X2 and the DNA Force, I was a little hesitant, but I pulled the trigger on it.
[01:31:05.417 --> 01:31:06.418]  It has changed my life.
[01:31:06.418 --> 01:31:08.601]  I've been taking it for about 24 days now.
[01:31:08.601 --> 01:31:10.122]  Counting the weights, staying in shape.

[01:31:20.112 --> 01:31:22.775]  Now, I'm able to function as a human again.
[01:31:22.875 --> 01:31:32.604]  Whether it's survival shield nascent iodine or DNA force, super male vitality, super female vitality, lung cleanse, fluoride shield, oxy powder.

[01:32:56.631 --> 01:32:57.432]  Others don't.
[01:33:09.366 --> 01:33:11.987]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:11.987 --> 01:33:18.210]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:18.210 --> 01:33:22.172]  When we hack the elite's email.
[01:33:22.172 --> 01:33:25.673]  Oh, when we catch them talking about nuking cities.
[01:33:25.673 --> 01:33:28.735]  I just ad-libbed that.
[01:33:28.735 --> 01:33:31.496]  That's why I used to sound so stupid.
[01:33:35.951 --> 01:33:36.432]  Whatever.
[01:33:36.432 --> 01:33:42.440]  The public doesn't care that the Globalists carried out 9-11 and fund the radical Muslims and are planning to probably nuke a major city.
[01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:44.303]  I just know Chicago's on their list.
[01:33:44.303 --> 01:33:45.525]  Okay, whatever.
[01:33:45.525 --> 01:33:46.286]  You want to get nuked?
[01:33:46.286 --> 01:33:46.646]  Go ahead.
[01:33:46.646 --> 01:33:49.150]  I'm sorry for you.
[01:33:49.150 --> 01:33:50.532]  Take all the vaccines, too, folks.
[01:33:50.532 --> 01:33:51.233]  The government loves you.
[01:33:53.433 --> 01:33:58.154]  I'm not, you know, obviously here bashing our listeners.
[01:33:58.154 --> 01:34:01.315]  I'm talking to new listeners, people that think that that's a joke.
[01:34:01.315 --> 01:34:05.336]  They think that what I'm saying isn't true or we're just trying to be sensational.
[01:34:05.336 --> 01:34:07.877]  No, we're not trying to be sensational.
[01:34:07.877 --> 01:34:15.058]  I could have been a lot bigger and been syndicated a lot faster and made more money selling out to the establishment.
[01:34:15.058 --> 01:34:17.499]  I could make talking about anything interesting.
[01:34:20.706 --> 01:34:27.792]  But I will not sell my soul out to the fraud of the New World Order.
[01:34:27.792 --> 01:34:32.256]  You sign on with them, you're signing on to abject pure evil.
[01:34:32.256 --> 01:34:36.479]  It's that simple.
[01:34:36.479 --> 01:34:41.863]  Now, I'm gonna go right to your phone calls and then into a bunch of news for folks that have been patient.
[01:34:41.863 --> 01:34:44.245]  I appreciate Richard on Veterans Day, a U.S.
[01:34:44.245 --> 01:34:45.146]  Army vet holding.
[01:34:45.146 --> 01:34:49.250]  We'll go to him first and then Tony, Ryan, David, and
[01:34:51.010 --> 01:34:52.651]  Others that are patiently holding like John.
[01:34:52.651 --> 01:34:56.133]  Let's talk about nukes in Chicago.
[01:34:56.133 --> 01:35:03.878]  Briefly, it is one of the best sales tactics out there to say, our clothing line is so popular, it's all selling out.
[01:35:03.878 --> 01:35:07.840]  Or our supplements are so good, better get it quick, it's about to sell out.
[01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:11.322]  We only say that when something's really selling out.
[01:35:11.322 --> 01:35:13.564]  And you don't like to have a bunch of product at the end of the year.
[01:35:14.977 --> 01:35:28.031]  Because of taxes, so we tend to try to budget enough to order stuff in in the fall, and then we don't order any other t-shirts, books, videos, supplements from the laboratories until New Year's.
[01:35:28.031 --> 01:35:32.717]  I've had to put in rush emergency orders for everything.
[01:35:32.717 --> 01:35:36.441]  Everything is shelling out except stuff that was already sold out.
[01:35:37.836 --> 01:35:43.121]  Like the new mystery stuff that we haven't announced yet that has never been sold out because we haven't launched it yet.
[01:35:43.121 --> 01:35:45.163]  And then Silver Bullet was sold out.
[01:35:45.163 --> 01:35:46.384]  OcuPower was sold out.
[01:35:46.384 --> 01:35:48.526]  It finally came in.
[01:35:48.526 --> 01:35:51.008]  Just an amazing overall nerve formula.
[01:35:51.008 --> 01:35:52.609]  Not just good for the eyes, but so much more.
[01:35:52.609 --> 01:35:55.672]  It's kind of the less expensive DNA force.
[01:35:55.672 --> 01:36:04.200]  You get a lot of the same benefits from our research that you get from the more expensive nutraceutical super grade DNA force.
[01:36:06.820 --> 01:36:10.864]  But we are selling out of the entire catalog right now.
[01:36:10.864 --> 01:36:12.646]  Hopefully, we'll get some of it in a little bit quicker.
[01:36:12.646 --> 01:36:20.414]  Take this Molon Labe shirt, the high-tech camo version that I've never got so many compliments wearing that I'm wearing right now.
[01:36:20.414 --> 01:36:23.878]  This is sold out in XXL, XLL.
[01:36:23.878 --> 01:36:27.001]  All we have it in is medium and small, and it may take a month.
[01:36:27.822 --> 01:36:31.044]  We get it from China in two weeks, we get it from the U.S.
[01:36:31.044 --> 01:36:32.224]  in a month or longer.
[01:36:32.224 --> 01:36:37.587]  I'm not complaining, it's just the bureaucracy, the cost, everything, to have it made in America.
[01:36:37.587 --> 01:36:51.674]  But it is high quality, it's very inexpensive for made in America, it's very high quality, and I've never had compliments, not wearing a Hugo Boss jacket, not wearing, you know, nice clothes, not wearing other gun shirts.
[01:36:51.674 --> 01:36:56.096]  I've never got compliments like I get with this camo shirt, and I wish we could sell it to you.
[01:36:56.960 --> 01:37:03.086]  We do have the gold leaf for women in a women's cut of Molon Labe in black and the men's in black.
[01:37:03.086 --> 01:37:04.847]  Two different designs in the ball caps.
[01:37:04.847 --> 01:37:13.915]  And we do have those in stock, InfowarsStore.com, MadeIn1776.com.
[01:37:13.915 --> 01:37:17.519]  And we had sold out of the brass belt buckles because they hadn't been able to produce enough.
[01:37:17.519 --> 01:37:18.900]  We print 500 of each.
[01:37:18.900 --> 01:37:20.161]  So another 150 came in.
[01:37:20.161 --> 01:37:21.302]  Those are almost sold out.
[01:37:21.302 --> 01:37:22.083]  And then those are gone.
[01:37:23.533 --> 01:37:34.889]  So InfoWarsStore.com is the big master site and has InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWars subgroups like MadeIn1776.com.
[01:37:34.889 --> 01:37:36.932]  We also have the Lung Cleanse that's selling out.
[01:37:36.932 --> 01:37:39.756]  Three shots in the mouth.
[01:37:39.756 --> 01:37:40.176]  And breathe in.
[01:37:41.340 --> 01:37:44.263]  It's amazing what it does when my larynx is tired or whatever.
[01:37:44.263 --> 01:37:45.845]  I've got a cold or sore throat.
[01:37:45.845 --> 01:37:50.831]  Better than any other brand out there because it's the Rolls-Royce of true essential oils and extracts.
[01:37:50.831 --> 01:37:52.152]  It's super thick.
[01:37:52.152 --> 01:37:59.941]  I challenge you to go to the store and find somebody else that's got one of these similar products that isn't, you know, just thin and watery and just some menthol with a few herbs.
[01:37:59.941 --> 01:38:01.443]  This has got dozens of them.
[01:38:03.061 --> 01:38:06.062]  under the highest quality organic extractions.
[01:38:06.062 --> 01:38:11.244]  ShowinfoWarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:38:11.244 --> 01:38:25.910]  And a couple times a day when I don't forget, once a day when I do forget, three times a day when I'm really on it, I take all these different products, dump them into a glass of water and drink it.
[01:38:25.910 --> 01:38:27.071]  And it's awesome.
[01:38:27.071 --> 01:38:31.993]  You can also take it straight up sublingually, but I like to do it this way because it tastes pretty good actually.
[01:38:33.968 --> 01:38:34.889]  When you mix them all together.
[01:38:34.889 --> 01:38:39.853]  Infowarslife.com, I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:38:39.853 --> 01:38:46.539]  But if you do want to stock up on any of the products, now is the time, because some of them may not be available for 12 weeks.
[01:38:46.539 --> 01:38:48.981]  I said 12 weeks last time for DNA Force, it took 16 weeks.
[01:38:48.981 --> 01:38:49.021]  888-253-3139.
[01:38:54.597 --> 01:38:57.539]  Infowarslife.com and that's how we fund the operation.
[01:38:57.539 --> 01:38:59.080]  Please support our local AM and FM stations.
[01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:00.441]  Become sponsors of them.
[01:39:00.441 --> 01:39:01.442]  Support their sponsors.
[01:39:01.442 --> 01:39:02.663]  Spread the word about them.
[01:39:02.663 --> 01:39:06.325]  That is key as well to support the broadcast and the transmission.
[01:39:06.325 --> 01:39:07.446]  And you've been doing it.
[01:39:07.446 --> 01:39:09.427]  That's why most stations had us on on the weekends.
[01:39:09.427 --> 01:39:10.328]  Then we go on at night.
[01:39:10.328 --> 01:39:11.609]  Then they put us on live.
[01:39:11.609 --> 01:39:20.274]  We salute those stations from Chicago to Oklahoma City to Lubbock, Texas to Los Angeles, California to Rochester, New York to
[01:39:21.115 --> 01:39:22.016]  You name it.
[01:39:22.016 --> 01:39:32.829]  We salute all of you, from Kansas City, Missouri, to you name it, to Needles, California, to Northern California, just almost 180 affiliates right now.
[01:39:32.829 --> 01:39:34.451]  We're just exploding.
[01:39:34.451 --> 01:39:36.934]  And the fact that a show this hardcore is on 170-something stations.
[01:39:38.496 --> 01:39:39.976]  And dominating the internet?
[01:39:39.976 --> 01:39:48.899]  I mean, it just shows there's still a lot of good people in government, a lot of good people in the companies out there, a lot of good people in the system, a lot of good people out there like you supporting us.
[01:39:48.899 --> 01:39:51.800]  And Americans didn't want to believe all this stuff was true.
[01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:54.400]  Now they know how much trouble we're in.
[01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:56.601]  And I'm not here to even demonize the system.
[01:39:56.601 --> 01:39:58.221]  I just want it to change.
[01:39:58.221 --> 01:39:59.882]  I don't want to take these people on.
[01:39:59.882 --> 01:40:00.542]  But I got to.
[01:40:03.106 --> 01:40:04.627]  It's like when you get mugged or something.
[01:40:04.627 --> 01:40:05.407]  You make the decision.
[01:40:05.407 --> 01:40:11.231]  Am I going to let this person take my wallet and probably go ahead and beat me over the head for fun?
[01:40:11.231 --> 01:40:11.591]  You know what?
[01:40:11.591 --> 01:40:13.993]  I'm going to go ahead and punch them right in the throat.
[01:40:13.993 --> 01:40:16.675]  And oh gee, I shouldn't have rammed their head into that concrete.
[01:40:16.675 --> 01:40:19.496]  I'm going to have to tell the cops why they're in a coma.
[01:40:19.496 --> 01:40:21.538]  I'm going to probably go to jail.
[01:40:21.538 --> 01:40:24.319]  But when they see the rap sheet, they'll let me out.
[01:40:24.319 --> 01:40:25.981]  And it's just happened to me twice being mugged.
[01:40:25.981 --> 01:40:27.421]  And the person pulls a knife or whatever.
[01:40:28.462 --> 01:40:30.165]  I'm just like, you know, I'm gonna have to hurt you now.
[01:40:30.165 --> 01:40:31.347]  And you know what?
[01:40:31.347 --> 01:40:32.569]  I'm kind of ashamed of it, Lord.
[01:40:32.569 --> 01:40:33.931]  I'm gonna enjoy it.
[01:40:35.080 --> 01:40:38.302]  And it's not that I'm a sadist and like to hurt innocent people.
[01:40:38.302 --> 01:40:43.164]  I just, I have this thing where I just, I actually do like hurting bad people.
[01:40:43.164 --> 01:40:44.145]  And I try to repent of it.
[01:40:44.145 --> 01:40:45.405]  I shouldn't enjoy it sometimes.
[01:40:45.405 --> 01:40:47.466]  It's been a long time since I've done something like that.
[01:40:47.466 --> 01:40:51.388]  But, you know, it's an analogy of the world.
[01:40:51.388 --> 01:40:53.409]  Politically, I fight with words.
[01:40:53.409 --> 01:40:54.690]  I fight with my heart.
[01:40:54.690 --> 01:40:56.050]  I fight with the truth.
[01:40:56.050 --> 01:41:00.252]  And I want to, with words, really hurt the globalists.
[01:41:00.252 --> 01:41:01.113]  I really do hate
[01:41:02.332 --> 01:41:11.278]  This professor that helped write the Obamacare plan and helped deceive Congress and the public, laughing at us, calling us stupid, and how they lied to us and snickering and giggling.
[01:41:11.278 --> 01:41:12.759]  I don't want to physically hurt him.
[01:41:12.759 --> 01:41:14.201]  That'd make him a martyr or a victim.
[01:41:14.201 --> 01:41:16.942]  I want to savage him with the truth.
[01:41:16.942 --> 01:41:21.065]  I want to show him that abusing people and ripping people off isn't funny.
[01:41:21.065 --> 01:41:23.047]  I want to get that smirk off his face.
[01:41:23.047 --> 01:41:24.108]  You know what I mean.
[01:41:24.108 --> 01:41:25.429]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tony.
[01:41:26.397 --> 01:41:27.177]  Good morning Alex.
[01:41:27.177 --> 01:41:28.258]  Good morning Alex.
[01:41:28.258 --> 01:41:29.778]  I'm a 27 year Army Veteran Sergeant.
[01:41:29.778 --> 01:41:32.619]  And I'm going to tell you why I am on the most wanted list of Obama.
[01:41:32.619 --> 01:41:34.340]  Because I took my oath to office.
[01:41:56.112 --> 01:42:00.600]  Defend and protect the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:01.141]  Seriously.
[01:42:01.141 --> 01:42:05.309]  And I still consider myself obligated under that oath.
[01:42:05.309 --> 01:42:08.876]  And that's why I always vote for liberty-loving candidates.
[01:42:12.602 --> 01:42:13.242]  Well that's right.
[01:42:13.242 --> 01:42:18.986]  The veterans, combat veterans are the most wanted, most hated by Homeland Security.
[01:42:18.986 --> 01:42:21.508]  But that doesn't mean Homeland Security on average is even bad.
[01:42:21.508 --> 01:42:22.929]  That's woken them up.
[01:42:22.929 --> 01:42:29.373]  Why do you think Obama and the globalists thought they could get away with saying veterans are the number one enemy?
[01:42:29.373 --> 01:42:33.376]  Because they're afraid of veterans.
[01:42:33.376 --> 01:42:38.620]  Because the veterans will fight back if needed.
[01:42:38.620 --> 01:42:41.982]  And they're not being fooled by Obama.
[01:42:43.777 --> 01:42:46.018]  Obama sucks!
[01:42:46.018 --> 01:42:47.258]  Well, you're right, brother.
[01:42:47.258 --> 01:42:49.299]  Veterans will fight back.
[01:42:49.299 --> 01:42:50.879]  Veterans aren't afraid to die.
[01:42:50.879 --> 01:42:53.300]  A lot of them are ready to die.
[01:42:53.300 --> 01:42:55.361]  They've been treated like crap.
[01:42:55.361 --> 01:42:58.362]  And they're trying to get a civil war started with veterans.
[01:42:58.362 --> 01:43:02.543]  So I want veterans to fight smart with their minds as long as possible.
[01:43:02.543 --> 01:43:08.385]  And if it does go to a shooting war, we need to not get in the civil war they want with the cops.
[01:43:08.385 --> 01:43:11.466]  We need to defend ourselves, and we know who the enemy is, don't we?
[01:43:12.918 --> 01:43:13.698]  Yes, we do.
[01:43:13.698 --> 01:43:18.521]  And I say to RuPaul, go baby, go!
[01:43:18.521 --> 01:43:20.642]  God bless you, brother, on Veterans Day.
[01:43:20.642 --> 01:43:24.504]  You know, people can say, oh, America's wars, and, well, Veterans Day.
[01:43:24.504 --> 01:43:27.626]  Listen, a lot of people got put in harm's way, and they were bad wars.
[01:43:27.626 --> 01:43:31.028]  But they were fighting for their family, for their buddies beside them.
[01:43:31.028 --> 01:43:35.470]  They were lied to about why they went to these wars, and they're treated like crap afterwards.
[01:43:35.470 --> 01:43:39.152]  They go and they fight proxy armies built by the globalists secretly, like Al Qaeda.
[01:43:39.152 --> 01:43:40.553]  They really were fighting Al Qaeda.
[01:43:42.149 --> 01:43:44.611]  And extremists in many cases.
[01:43:44.611 --> 01:43:49.753]  And they're hated because now the age of men is coming to an end according to our controllers.
[01:43:49.753 --> 01:43:52.755]  And it's the age of the machines and the technocracy.
[01:43:52.755 --> 01:43:59.299]  And the age of pharmacological and chemical and radiological warfare by the elite against us.
[01:43:59.299 --> 01:44:11.206]  And so we need to understand if the globalists hate the veterans, by extension the police, I mean come on, same thing, then they need to not be our enemies.
[01:44:13.046 --> 01:44:14.948]  It's very simple.
[01:44:14.948 --> 01:44:19.693]  If the New World Order's coming after somebody, there's a reason for it.
[01:44:19.693 --> 01:44:22.255]  And nine times out of ten, it's because they're good.
[01:44:22.255 --> 01:44:24.357]  And in them is the hope.
[01:44:24.357 --> 01:44:26.379]  But it's not just to the veterans our hope, it's to all of us.
[01:44:26.379 --> 01:44:28.742]  We're all veterans of a propaganda war.
[01:44:28.742 --> 01:44:33.687]  We're all veterans of the vaccine war, and the fluoride war, and the GMO war being carried out against us.
[01:44:33.687 --> 01:44:34.808]  You need to realize that, folks.
[01:44:34.808 --> 01:44:36.850]  You are under New World Order attack.
[01:44:38.697 --> 01:44:46.841]  Whether you believe that or not, whether you work for him or not, you have not been exempted.
[01:44:46.841 --> 01:44:55.346]  So on this Veterans Day, remember, the troops are veterans of the vaccine program ten times what it is for the public.
[01:44:55.346 --> 01:45:00.568]  The troops are the victims of the testing that the political class that hates them has done.
[01:45:00.568 --> 01:45:06.932]  Steve Pucinich is coming up to talk about that.
[01:45:08.373 --> 01:45:09.934]  Let's talk to Tony and then Ryan.
[01:45:09.934 --> 01:45:15.457]  Tony, in FEMA Region 3, what former state are you calling me from, now under FEMA control?
[01:45:15.457 --> 01:45:16.718]  Pennsylvania, Alex.
[01:45:16.718 --> 01:45:18.859]  Alright, brother, what's on your mind?
[01:45:18.859 --> 01:45:36.330]  Um, I just wanted to recommend a guest, um, a man named Carl, K-A-R-L, Lentz, L-E-N-T-Z, and, uh, he has a talk show program, um, he helps people for free, basically getting their kids back from CPS, and what he's done is he's basically
[01:45:37.185 --> 01:45:37.425]  I think so.
[01:45:56.650 --> 01:46:10.474]  And as a man, you trump their agency and the claim trumps... Sure, well it's time to get Alfred Adasko and all those guys and some of the constitutional lawyers that put out real patriot information, not patriot mythology.
[01:46:10.474 --> 01:46:16.256]  I'm not saying the guy you are talking about does that, I don't know who he is, but I don't get into it a lot because it's a minefield.
[01:46:16.256 --> 01:46:21.198]  You can push people into legitimate stuff, it's very complex, and then they get off into what they call
[01:46:22.478 --> 01:46:26.960]  You know, paper terrorism that will get you locked under the jail.
[01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:37.945]  But yeah, a lot of statistics show pro se litigants, if they really know what they're doing, are doing better in many cases than the lawyers.
[01:46:37.945 --> 01:46:40.206]  The average lawyer will just collect money and slay it on the river.
[01:46:40.206 --> 01:46:47.750]  If you get a top lawyer, they actually are into having a really good win record and want to win, but you will pay through the nose for that.
[01:46:47.750 --> 01:46:49.591]  Thank you so much, great points.
[01:46:49.591 --> 01:46:51.332]  Ryan in Colorado, you're on the air.
[01:46:52.639 --> 01:46:54.200]  Hey Alex, great to talk to you finally.
[01:46:54.200 --> 01:47:02.547]  I want to know about the outcome in Ferguson, Missouri.
[01:47:02.547 --> 01:47:05.550]  Would that push the UN gun treaty ban even more?
[01:47:05.550 --> 01:47:14.217]  And one more question, I live in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and I'm surrounded by veterans everywhere I go.
[01:47:14.217 --> 01:47:20.823]  And would you put it past the elite to possibly nuke this way to Colorado Springs, Colorado?
[01:47:21.605 --> 01:47:26.526]  Well, if I was a foreign enemy, that's exactly what I would nuke would be Colorado Springs.
[01:47:26.526 --> 01:47:28.607]  Because that's the site of the real U.S.
[01:47:28.607 --> 01:47:34.748]  government and NORTHCOM, you know, just outside Denver.
[01:47:34.748 --> 01:47:42.290]  And that is exactly where all the big underground bases and bunkers are and the nukes and they've got a whole Congress there ready to go.
[01:47:43.905 --> 01:47:51.247]  I mean, if I was a terrorist, again, they're always going to hit a populist area, like Dallas or Chicago, if they want to terrorize us.
[01:47:51.247 --> 01:47:57.429]  It won't be the UN, it won't be the Capitol, or wherever a real terrorist would hit.
[01:47:57.429 --> 01:48:07.872]  If I was some foreign terrorist group, I would hit the Congress, or I would hit something like Colorado Springs, or I'd blow up the UN.
[01:48:08.874 --> 01:48:13.758]  And again, before they put the New York Times that I would blow it up, I'm saying if I was a terrorist, I would never do anything like that.
[01:48:13.758 --> 01:48:15.399]  Anything offensive, plus I wouldn't have a nuke.
[01:48:15.399 --> 01:48:18.881]  I don't know, my life's so bizarre, they might deliver one here one day, I have no idea.
[01:48:18.881 --> 01:48:26.507]  But getting serious here, yes, I think you're in a major terrorist spot.
[01:48:26.507 --> 01:48:34.193]  And if there was ever a government coup, counter-coup, let's say NORTHCOM and General Dempsey decided to not go along with the nuking of Chicago.
[01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:37.001]  Alright, well thank you for that information.
[01:48:37.001 --> 01:48:37.381]  Oh, one more thing.
[01:48:37.381 --> 01:48:37.781]  The UN Gun Treaty.
[01:48:59.784 --> 01:49:01.525]  Do you have any more information on the U.N.
[01:49:01.525 --> 01:49:02.746]  gun treaty at all?
[01:49:02.746 --> 01:49:03.786]  Oh yeah, I meant to answer that.
[01:49:03.786 --> 01:49:04.867]  Thank you for the call.
[01:49:04.867 --> 01:49:06.248]  Yeah, the U.N.
[01:49:06.248 --> 01:49:09.850]  treaty says that civilian ownership of firearms should be abolished.
[01:49:09.850 --> 01:49:12.312]  That it threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state.
[01:49:12.312 --> 01:49:13.953]  That's the text of the treaty.
[01:49:13.953 --> 01:49:19.176]  And it puts in all sorts of arms restrictions and ammo restrictions and global regulations.
[01:49:19.176 --> 01:49:22.698]  And Obama says he'll follow it even if Congress doesn't ratify it.
[01:49:22.698 --> 01:49:24.779]  The Senate doesn't ratify it, which they say they won't.
[01:49:24.779 --> 01:49:25.760]  They've warned him not to.
[01:49:26.980 --> 01:49:29.321]  And, uh, yeah, mass riots across the U.S.
[01:49:29.321 --> 01:49:31.442]  is what brought gun control in in the 60s.
[01:49:31.442 --> 01:49:37.465]  Why would you restrict people's guns because there's looting all over the country, in Detroit and places?
[01:49:37.465 --> 01:49:40.566]  It's guns that help stop it.
[01:49:40.566 --> 01:49:44.908]  So, I mean, mobs don't go down the street, usually in cities where everybody's armed.
[01:49:44.908 --> 01:49:47.009]  If you start trying to burn down somebody's business, they're going to shoot you.
[01:49:48.055 --> 01:49:55.616]  I'm not looking for trouble, but you come on my property, if a mob comes down the road to my house, there's a nine-foot fence around it and barbed wire inside that.
[01:49:55.616 --> 01:50:00.537]  Doesn't look like an army base, it looks real nice, but it is basically a base.
[01:50:00.537 --> 01:50:05.198]  And you've got the heavy door, the whole nine yards, and you're going to be met with resistance.
[01:50:05.198 --> 01:50:08.498]  And not because I'm a tough guy, I'm not going to roll over.
[01:50:08.498 --> 01:50:09.959]  My instinct is to fight.
[01:50:09.959 --> 01:50:11.039]  It feels good.
[01:50:11.039 --> 01:50:16.340]  Not because, here's the thing, going with your gut and what you're meant to do also feels good.
[01:50:16.340 --> 01:50:16.900]  See, that's why
[01:50:17.932 --> 01:50:20.776]  They've held off on the Civil War until they think they can win it.
[01:50:20.776 --> 01:50:23.700]  They understand Americans love to fight.
[01:50:23.700 --> 01:50:26.824]  And if they really want to start a Civil War, it's just going to be unbelievable.
[01:50:26.824 --> 01:50:32.852]  The problem is they want to wipe out the police and military, and they plan on us wiping them out in the Civil War.
[01:50:32.852 --> 01:50:33.973]  And so that's why I've said...
[01:50:35.242 --> 01:50:42.424]  Civil War starts, I'm just gonna try to stay in a location, broadcast, and I'm not gonna be off, I'm not a military person.
[01:50:42.424 --> 01:50:45.805]  I'm not gonna be a George Washington out there trying to lead people.
[01:50:45.805 --> 01:50:52.847]  I'll be more like a, you know, Thomas Jefferson or something, sitting back and trying to be, you know, come up with a political solution.
[01:50:52.847 --> 01:50:55.208]  But I'll leave the fighting to, but I will defend myself.
[01:50:55.208 --> 01:50:56.668]  I will defend myself.

[01:52:14.640 --> 01:52:19.021]  If you're fortunate enough to have retirement savings, it's probably not enough.

[01:54:28.826 --> 01:54:39.170]  It's like it always is.
[01:54:39.170 --> 01:54:42.931]  Alex Jones here, back live, going to your phone calls.
[01:54:42.931 --> 01:54:49.694]  I've studied how different technocracies, different political systems, different oligarchies
[01:54:51.474 --> 01:54:54.539]  Have controlled civilizations.
[01:54:54.539 --> 01:54:57.064]  Princeton came out last year, Yale this year.
[01:54:57.064 --> 01:54:58.666]  I've got the articles in the stack today.
[01:54:58.666 --> 01:55:00.609]  I may be flipping the tube.
[01:55:02.461 --> 01:55:05.122]  And said, no, the world's run by an oligarchy.
[01:55:05.122 --> 01:55:08.584]  And yes, we are totalitarian, and yes, foreign banks run America.
[01:55:08.584 --> 01:55:13.606]  It's like, one time I saw this professor, Thomas Barnett, that lectures at the Army War College.
[01:55:13.606 --> 01:55:14.347]  He was on C-SPAN.
[01:55:14.347 --> 01:55:21.070]  He said, we're part of a global government, and we're under their control, and, you know, we work for Wall Street, and the military is, you know, going to take over, and all this stuff.
[01:55:21.070 --> 01:55:24.952]  And I called him up to get him on as a guest, and then he clicked, my producer.
[01:55:26.092 --> 01:55:31.255]  Came on the line and said, back then it was Genesis getting the guest on, that period.
[01:55:31.255 --> 01:55:33.357]  And I, cause I would tell them who I wanted.
[01:55:33.357 --> 01:55:40.241]  And so I had them call him back and I got on the line, you know, via phone patch over the microphone.
[01:55:40.241 --> 01:55:42.382]  And I said to him, I said, listen, come on the show.
[01:55:42.382 --> 01:55:44.583]  And he goes, no.
[01:55:44.583 --> 01:55:46.084]  And I said, well, come on, come on and defend.
[01:55:46.084 --> 01:55:47.445]  He goes, listen, you're going to be defeated.
[01:55:47.445 --> 01:55:48.266]  You'll never stop us.
[01:55:49.178 --> 01:55:50.199]  He started laughing at me.
[01:55:50.199 --> 01:55:55.244]  I mean, you're talking to these guys, and they go, well, just come on and promote world government then.
[01:55:55.244 --> 01:55:57.806]  Don't do it by stealth.
[01:55:57.806 --> 01:55:58.587]  Come on and tell us.
[01:55:58.587 --> 01:56:02.050]  He goes, never.
[01:56:02.050 --> 01:56:03.071]  And he was just so angry.
[01:56:03.071 --> 01:56:04.712]  I said, you will be defeated.
[01:56:04.712 --> 01:56:07.154]  And he was just like, ha, ha, ha.
[01:56:07.154 --> 01:56:10.518]  It's like out of a movie when you understand, just like this
[01:56:12.614 --> 01:56:16.637]  Obama guy, this professor, going, yeah, they're a bunch of dumb people.
[01:56:16.637 --> 01:56:20.960]  We kept it secret, lack of transparency, so yeah, massively increased prices.
[01:56:20.960 --> 01:56:22.741]  Gotta hide the cost.
[01:56:22.741 --> 01:56:24.523]  That's how we fooled Congress, too, yeah.
[01:56:27.329 --> 01:56:32.391]  When I was a kid growing up, I'd see movies with bad guys and they'd rub their hands together and go, I will soon defeat all the good people.
[01:56:32.391 --> 01:56:34.311]  Ah, yes, it's so much fun to be evil.
[01:56:34.311 --> 01:56:36.092]  And I thought, you know, that's ridiculous.
[01:56:36.092 --> 01:56:37.812]  That's not how bad people act.
[01:56:37.812 --> 01:56:40.793]  And then I grew up and found out that's exactly how they act.
[01:56:40.793 --> 01:56:46.675]  I used to grow up seeing mobster movies where they'd go, you know, I really think you need to be my friend.
[01:56:46.675 --> 01:56:48.355]  I want to know you good.
[01:56:48.355 --> 01:56:49.716]  And I was at this big 9-11 event.
[01:56:51.348 --> 01:56:51.528]  I don't
[01:57:10.305 --> 01:57:21.027]  Nephew or something and he's like this big guy and I'm in a leisure Exercise Russian mobster jogging outfit and he's going Alex I love you!
[01:57:21.027 --> 01:57:24.088]  I wish I could tell you how I feel about my wife!
[01:57:24.088 --> 01:57:26.088]  The stuff we know is so terrible!
[01:57:26.088 --> 01:57:27.849]  I love you!
[01:57:27.849 --> 01:57:30.189]  I'll go out to dinner with you tomorrow!
[01:57:30.189 --> 01:57:31.729]  You're so nice!
[01:57:31.729 --> 01:57:32.950]  You're so brave!
[01:57:32.950 --> 01:57:38.411]  And I was and I went and looked up the guy later and we did go out some that night people would see him and go huh?
[01:57:39.451 --> 01:57:41.613]  And then I went and looked the guy up and it's who they said.
[01:57:41.613 --> 01:57:42.973]  Oh, Alex!
[01:57:42.973 --> 01:57:43.634]  Oh, gee!
[01:57:43.634 --> 01:57:45.775]  And the guy would get teary eyes.
[01:57:45.775 --> 01:57:49.858]  He's so good!
[01:57:49.858 --> 01:57:54.240]  I'd see that in movies when Robert De Niro would do that and say, this is bad acting.
[01:57:54.240 --> 01:57:54.801]  No!
[01:57:54.801 --> 01:57:58.263]  That's how they act!
[01:57:58.263 --> 01:57:59.023]  I'm digressing.
[01:57:59.023 --> 01:58:01.004]  I said I'd go to your phone calls.
[01:58:01.004 --> 01:58:01.665]  It's just that
[01:58:03.080 --> 01:58:06.041]  Well, the globalists actually go, ah, the power's mine!
[01:58:06.041 --> 01:58:07.042]  We're gonna screw everyone!
[01:58:07.042 --> 01:58:08.242]  Oh, it's so much fun!
[01:58:08.242 --> 01:58:10.663]  Put poison in their water!
[01:58:10.663 --> 01:58:14.125]  I mean, just, why?
[01:58:14.125 --> 01:58:15.625]  Why?
[01:58:15.625 --> 01:58:19.307]  I'll get you and your little dog, too!
[01:58:19.307 --> 01:58:20.868]  We're just all naive, yeah!
[01:58:20.868 --> 01:58:21.968]  Government likes us!
[01:58:21.968 --> 01:58:23.189]  It's run by nice people!
[01:58:23.189 --> 01:58:28.071]  We're gonna go on a break, go to David in Nebraska.
[01:58:28.071 --> 01:58:30.112]  We're gonna go to, uh, John.
[01:58:31.801 --> 01:58:34.725]  Reena, Douglas, and Daniel.

[01:58:41.614 --> 01:58:45.599]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:49.116 --> 01:58:55.359]  Another major health threat, this one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:58:55.359 --> 01:58:58.040]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:58:58.040 --> 01:59:05.063]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:59:05.063 --> 01:59:08.064]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:59:08.064 --> 01:59:11.085]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:59:11.085 --> 01:59:13.026]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:59:13.026 --> 01:59:15.867]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:59:15.947 --> 01:59:21.689]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:59:21.689 --> 01:59:25.190]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:59:25.190 --> 01:59:28.291]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[02:00:04.980 --> 02:00:06.281]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.281 --> 02:00:08.062]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.062 --> 02:00:09.824]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:09.824 --> 02:00:11.405]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.405 --> 02:00:12.946]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.946 --> 02:00:17.130]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.130 --> 02:00:22.294]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.294 --> 02:00:26.978]  By the way, the crew liked my Italian gangster story.
[02:00:26.978 --> 02:00:29.380]  It's true story.
[02:00:29.380 --> 02:00:31.241]  But they didn't get why I was rubbing my face.
[02:00:31.241 --> 02:00:33.423]  No, that's what he was doing to my face.
[02:00:35.472 --> 02:00:36.252]  Yeah, how you doing Alex?
[02:00:36.252 --> 02:00:37.413]  I just had a quick phone real quick for you.
[02:00:37.413 --> 02:00:40.475]  It's just a few sentences long, if you don't mind.
[02:00:40.475 --> 02:00:42.115]  Alright, you need to stop using their pills.
[02:01:02.898 --> 02:01:08.682]  Because the pills are the tools to rule the able through a problematic soulless numbing.
[02:01:08.682 --> 02:01:14.507]  They're going to keep dumbing until they fool the faithful with a holographic second coming.
[02:01:14.507 --> 02:01:18.490]  They spray the skies, deny the tides, and supply the highs.
[02:01:18.490 --> 02:01:22.913]  Well, that's a good poem or rhyme.
[02:01:22.913 --> 02:01:27.036]  You ought to go into hip-hop.
[02:01:27.036 --> 02:01:31.439]  I mean, you can find me at Facebook slash B-E-A-R-E-N, Barron.
[02:01:33.209 --> 02:01:37.393]  Uh, I'm not like a rapper or anything like that.
[02:01:37.393 --> 02:01:40.735]  I just, you know... You're not a rapper, you're an O.G.
[02:01:40.735 --> 02:01:41.116]  Macker!
[02:01:41.116 --> 02:01:43.578]  I like to read and write poetry.
[02:01:43.578 --> 02:01:45.660]  I'm a racist, Alex.
[02:01:45.660 --> 02:01:46.600]  Hey, we love you, brother.
[02:01:46.600 --> 02:01:47.381]  Having fun with it.
[02:01:47.381 --> 02:01:48.202]  Take care.
[02:01:48.202 --> 02:01:49.162]  Thank you, David.
[02:01:49.162 --> 02:01:51.164]  John, John, you're on the air.
[02:01:51.164 --> 02:01:53.186]  You want to talk about nukes in Chicago.
[02:01:53.186 --> 02:01:54.727]  Go ahead.
[02:01:54.727 --> 02:02:00.112]  Yeah, um, actually I'm in, I reside in, uh, FEMA Camp 5 here up here in Wisconsin.
[02:02:00.874 --> 02:02:23.265]  I was listening to a local radio program last week during the elections and there was a blurb that came on once, I haven't heard it anywhere else, that was it eight or ten generals, I guess, and higher ranking officials were released, most of which were released because of
[02:02:24.730 --> 02:02:27.612]  Loss of confidence in one of them.
[02:02:27.612 --> 02:02:30.173]  Thousands, thousands of officers.
[02:02:30.173 --> 02:02:32.134]  Dozens and dozens of generals a month.
[02:02:32.134 --> 02:02:33.235]  It's in the hundreds.
[02:02:33.235 --> 02:02:35.356]  And it's all the head nuke commanders, you name it.
[02:02:35.356 --> 02:02:37.297]  Yes, that's going on.
[02:02:37.297 --> 02:02:43.340]  Yeah, well, it's kind of strange that that happened last week and now this other story breaks, you know, so.
[02:02:43.340 --> 02:02:48.383]  Well, I'm going to steal your term because it's not just FEMA Region 5 that you're in up in Wisconsin.
[02:02:48.383 --> 02:02:49.083]  I'm in FEMA Region 6.
[02:02:49.083 --> 02:02:49.904]  You're right.
[02:02:49.904 --> 02:02:51.285]  You're calling from FEMA Camp 5.
[02:02:53.035 --> 02:03:07.842]  I mean, because just identifying that we're under FEMA since 1979, and that it's openly preparing for martial law, we should just identify we're in the... They've already put the world into 10 regions, each country into 10 regions, and let's just identify that we're under FEMA.
[02:03:07.842 --> 02:03:14.245]  I wonder if I could use that in my VA ID.
[02:03:14.245 --> 02:03:15.566]  Probably.
[02:03:15.566 --> 02:03:16.466]  God bless you, brother.
[02:03:16.466 --> 02:03:17.807]  Anything else?
[02:03:17.807 --> 02:03:18.688]  Yeah, one more thing.
[02:03:18.688 --> 02:03:21.369]  You know, it was Obama...
[02:03:22.890 --> 02:03:25.252]  Locking up the internet and stuff like that.
[02:03:25.252 --> 02:03:34.318]  I have access videos of yours that you've been posting from time to time and I access them and I get no audio.
[02:03:34.318 --> 02:03:40.203]  I go to YouTube, get the same video, no audio.
[02:03:40.856 --> 02:03:47.378]  Yeah, I'm hearing this from a lot of people, that suddenly there's no audio on our videos, and then we go check them and there's video.
[02:03:47.378 --> 02:03:50.738]  Folks, send us emails at showtipsandinfowars.com.
[02:03:50.738 --> 02:03:51.899]  Tell us what you're seeing.
[02:03:51.899 --> 02:03:54.339]  God bless you, appreciate your call.
[02:03:54.339 --> 02:04:02.201]  I'm going to start going to Bill in Thailand, and then we'll go back to callers, but Pachenik's coming up, so kind of address your questions to him or comments.
[02:04:02.201 --> 02:04:06.002]  Bill in Thailand, what's on your mind?
[02:04:06.002 --> 02:04:07.483]  Hello, Alex.
[02:04:07.483 --> 02:04:08.603]  Bill in Thailand here.
[02:04:09.490 --> 02:04:20.035]  The cities you spoke about on the Nuclist are the same cities that were in the running to host the Republican National Convention.
[02:04:20.035 --> 02:04:25.017]  I know because they chose Cleveland and my family's from there.
[02:04:25.017 --> 02:04:26.198]  Wait a minute, I forgot that.
[02:04:26.198 --> 02:04:30.700]  They were looking at Dallas, Denver, Cleveland, and Chicago.
[02:04:30.700 --> 02:04:34.761]  Oh my gosh, Nuclist cities match Republican convention sites.
[02:04:34.761 --> 02:04:37.422]  Where did they choose?
[02:04:37.422 --> 02:04:38.443]  They chose Cleveland.
[02:04:39.090 --> 02:04:42.072]  That's right.
[02:04:42.072 --> 02:04:47.016]  Will Obama nukes the Republican National Convention.
[02:04:47.016 --> 02:04:48.797]  That's a way to take out your enemies right there.
[02:04:48.797 --> 02:04:51.659]  Wow, I'm going to come back to you.
[02:04:51.659 --> 02:04:52.059]  Stay there.
[02:04:52.059 --> 02:04:56.202]  You'll be off the hold, but we're going to go to Rena, Douglas, Daniel, Bill, and others.
[02:04:56.202 --> 02:04:56.583]  Stay with us.
[02:04:59.232 --> 02:05:02.874]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:05:02.874 --> 02:05:07.157]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:05:07.157 --> 02:05:08.938]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:05:08.938 --> 02:05:16.803]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:05:16.803 --> 02:05:17.944]  But for how long?
[02:05:17.944 --> 02:05:20.165]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[02:05:20.165 --> 02:05:24.588]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[02:05:24.588 --> 02:05:26.449]  Infidel Body Armor.
[02:05:26.449 --> 02:05:27.390]  Just won't quit.
[02:05:28.872 --> 02:05:39.436]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[02:05:39.436 --> 02:05:45.899]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[02:05:45.899 --> 02:05:48.240]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:51.321]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality.
[02:05:51.321 --> 02:05:58.204]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[02:05:58.604 --> 02:06:04.729]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[02:06:04.729 --> 02:06:08.051]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[02:06:08.051 --> 02:06:09.793]  Here we go, folks, I'm being a sergeant!
[02:06:09.793 --> 02:06:16.197]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[02:06:16.197 --> 02:06:22.102]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking our hands down on the streets?
[02:06:22.242 --> 02:06:26.184]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[02:06:26.184 --> 02:06:29.146]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[02:06:29.146 --> 02:06:37.551]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[02:06:37.551 --> 02:06:39.652]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[02:06:39.652 --> 02:06:40.693]  It's a war against the truth.
[02:06:41.053 --> 02:06:49.997]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
[02:06:49.997 --> 02:06:52.659]  Visit InfoWarsNews.com today.

[02:06:58.325 --> 02:06:59.646]  The experts are clear.
[02:06:59.646 --> 02:07:06.771]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[02:07:06.771 --> 02:07:13.055]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:13.055 --> 02:07:16.638]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[02:07:16.758 --> 02:07:20.981]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[02:07:20.981 --> 02:07:26.306]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[02:07:26.306 --> 02:07:27.306]  Not our iodine.
[02:07:27.306 --> 02:07:33.671]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits and is tested and proven to be completely pure.
[02:07:33.671 --> 02:07:35.693]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today.
[02:07:35.693 --> 02:07:37.274]  See the informational videos.
[02:07:37.274 --> 02:07:39.236]  Read the information there compiled.
[02:07:39.236 --> 02:07:43.439]  And for a limited time, when you use promo code NOW at checkout, you get a
[02:07:43.439 --> 02:07:43.699]  We're good.
[02:08:16.872 --> 02:08:20.933]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:08:20.933 --> 02:08:22.894]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:22.894 --> 02:08:30.056]  Words like violence break the silence.
[02:08:30.056 --> 02:08:33.837]  Come crashing in, into my little world.
[02:08:33.837 --> 02:08:37.559]  Painful to me, it's right through me.
[02:08:37.559 --> 02:08:40.420]  Don't you understand?
[02:08:40.420 --> 02:08:41.720]  Oh, my little girl.
[02:08:52.127 --> 02:08:57.252]  Words are very unnecessary with your lover.
[02:08:57.252 --> 02:08:59.954]  And they can only do harm, it's true.
[02:08:59.954 --> 02:09:03.176]  In my experience.
[02:09:03.176 --> 02:09:07.320]  That kills more relationships getting into arguments than anything else.
[02:09:07.320 --> 02:09:08.621]  Leave it lie.
[02:09:08.621 --> 02:09:14.505]  But what brings societies and civilizations down is silence.
[02:09:14.505 --> 02:09:19.990]  And the reason we played that intro, I was talking to Dr. Steve Pachinick, a legendary, if you study such things,
[02:09:21.642 --> 02:09:30.085]  And, of course, kids today don't even know who Chuck Yeager is, so... By the way, tomorrow, Freo Ricky Ross, the biggest cocaine dealer, arguably, in U.S.
[02:09:30.085 --> 02:09:40.848]  history, certainly the biggest on the West Coast, $30 million a day at some times, with the CIA, is going to be landing here in a couple hours, and is going to be here with us in studio for two hours tomorrow.
[02:09:40.848 --> 02:09:50.451]  Of course, he's a big part of the new movie, Kill the Messenger, on Gary Webb, of course, who I knew very well and was going to be coming on my show to vindicate himself when they killed him.
[02:09:51.957 --> 02:09:56.303]  Just like the DC Madam.
[02:09:56.303 --> 02:09:57.525]  I don't want to get into that.
[02:09:57.525 --> 02:09:58.466]  That's a whole other story.
[02:09:58.466 --> 02:10:02.291]  The point is, you hear real news, cutting-edge information here.
[02:10:02.291 --> 02:10:05.435]  Rick Ross, the real Rick Ross, not the fat rapper.
[02:10:05.435 --> 02:10:06.857]  He'll be here with us in studio.
[02:10:09.858 --> 02:10:12.440]  We are joined by Dr. Steve Pachinick for the next 15 minutes.
[02:10:12.440 --> 02:10:14.282]  StevePachinick.com.
[02:10:14.282 --> 02:10:18.446]  He's a medical doctor and a board-examining psychiatrist.
[02:10:18.446 --> 02:10:22.030]  And of course held the rank, basically, of colonel when he was in the Navy.
[02:10:22.030 --> 02:10:24.632]  Did a lot of secret operations he can't get into.
[02:10:24.632 --> 02:10:27.555]  Helped found Delta Force with General Boykin.
[02:10:27.555 --> 02:10:31.458]  And of course ran PSYOPs for the State Department and advised the U.S.
[02:10:31.458 --> 02:10:31.659]  Army.
[02:10:33.357 --> 02:10:36.380]  And of course he is a composite character, the Jack Ryan character.
[02:10:36.380 --> 02:10:39.102]  Nobody probably knows who that is nowadays.
[02:10:39.102 --> 02:10:42.185]  From the Patriot Games and wrote a bunch of books with Tom Clancy.
[02:10:42.185 --> 02:10:45.407]  He has a new book that he advised on that just came out as well.
[02:10:45.407 --> 02:10:47.909]  And he also has a medical company that he never talks about.
[02:10:47.909 --> 02:10:51.332]  I'm going to get him to talk about that at the bottom of the hour and take your phone calls.
[02:10:51.332 --> 02:10:52.854]  I know we have callers left over from before.
[02:10:53.294 --> 02:10:54.475]  Pchenik can talk about anything.
[02:10:54.475 --> 02:10:58.178]  Just address your comment or question at him for those first bank of callers.
[02:10:58.178 --> 02:11:01.540]  I'm going to do another bank of callers specifically for Pchenik 800-2599231.
[02:11:01.540 --> 02:11:09.907]  Trained in psychiatry at Harvard University and international relations at MIT.
[02:11:09.907 --> 02:11:13.510]  His novels are based on over 20 years experience resolving international crises.
[02:11:13.510 --> 02:11:18.474]  He's a top hostage negotiator for the Department of State and for four administrations.
[02:11:18.474 --> 02:11:21.076]  And he's of course been a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[02:11:21.676 --> 02:11:32.445]  He came on my show back in 2002 and said that 9-11 was an inside job and that Bin Laden was dead and their government was financing radical Muslims and letting us attack us and ordering stand downs.
[02:11:32.445 --> 02:11:34.407]  The CFR called up threatening him at the time.
[02:11:35.851 --> 02:11:43.415]  And I remember he called me, he goes, yes, they're visiting me, yes, they're very upset, that transcript, oh boy, I guess leave it up, but what do you think?
[02:11:43.415 --> 02:11:45.597]  And, well, the rest is history.
[02:11:45.597 --> 02:11:52.961]  And then, basically, stuff he's covered on the air has been attacked by Stratford, which, again, is an admitted CIA echo chamber.
[02:11:53.541 --> 02:11:56.143]  Because the CIA is not supposed to be involved in domestic propaganda.
[02:11:56.143 --> 02:11:59.265]  They made it legal this year, but before that they used Stratford for that.
[02:11:59.265 --> 02:12:07.030]  Which, overall, Stratford promotes guns and some freedom issues, so at least they're not communist in their ideology.
[02:12:07.030 --> 02:12:11.413]  But as a CIA tentacle, I'm not even saying they're the worst thing out there.
[02:12:11.413 --> 02:12:16.576]  But they do criticize me for no reason, because I don't believe they're baloney on Bin Laden.
[02:12:16.576 --> 02:12:18.277]  But Dr. Pucinich joins us.
[02:12:18.277 --> 02:12:21.940]  He was on Sunday for just two segments and was just dropping bombshell after bombshell
[02:12:23.047 --> 02:12:28.186]  I want you to talk to us like we're five years old, Dr. Puccini, because whenever you're talking, I can tell you're talking to the establishment.
[02:12:29.226 --> 02:12:31.067]  And that's important to have that conduit.
[02:12:31.067 --> 02:12:33.709]  But there are different groups in the establishment, obviously.
[02:12:33.709 --> 02:12:42.314]  So talk about the different power structures that are there, the good, the bad, the ugly, the different mafias that are there, the different combines that are there, in your well-researched view.
[02:12:42.314 --> 02:12:47.157]  And then describe to us how you see the battle front, the battle space.
[02:12:47.157 --> 02:12:51.240]  Will they pull a false flag to make Obama look like an angel and pull his bacon?
[02:12:51.240 --> 02:12:53.861]  Because he's falling apart so fast.
[02:12:53.861 --> 02:12:54.922]  What's going on with Russia?
[02:12:54.922 --> 02:12:56.083]  I know you're an expert on that.
[02:12:56.980 --> 02:13:01.802]  I don't like the Russkies and the whole Ukraine situation and this gas pipeline.
[02:13:01.802 --> 02:13:06.224]  All of it with Dr. Steve Pachinik right now.
[02:13:06.224 --> 02:13:09.125]  And then we'll go to Bill in Thailand and everybody else that's holding.
[02:13:09.125 --> 02:13:13.206]  Renee in Canada, Douglas in Idaho, Daniel in Colorado, Wayne in Texas.
[02:13:13.206 --> 02:13:17.488]  All right, Doc, there's my long hypomanic introduction to you.
[02:13:17.488 --> 02:13:18.628]  You've got the floor now.
[02:13:18.628 --> 02:13:20.429]  Tell us, please answer the question.
[02:13:20.429 --> 02:13:21.950]  What are the real power structures?
[02:13:21.950 --> 02:13:24.090]  Who are the power players in your view?
[02:13:24.090 --> 02:13:25.371]  And who are the good, the bad, and the ugly?
[02:13:26.274 --> 02:13:31.176]  Well, the real power structure always goes behind what Stalin once said.
[02:13:31.176 --> 02:13:36.479]  The power of the gun is what determines the viability of a power structure.
[02:13:36.479 --> 02:13:40.261]  That's pretty crude, but it is very real, even in a republic.
[02:13:40.261 --> 02:13:41.902]  And remember, we are in a republic.
[02:13:41.902 --> 02:13:44.343]  I want to congratulate everybody who's a veteran.
[02:13:44.343 --> 02:13:50.146]  But basically, the power structure in America is what Eisenhower said, the military-industrial complex.
[02:13:50.746 --> 02:13:52.288]  As evidenced by the following.
[02:13:52.288 --> 02:14:00.255]  First, it's the military with its numerous generals, admirals, and all kinds of senior officials, whom we do not need now.
[02:14:00.919 --> 02:14:02.741]  We are downsizing our military.
[02:14:02.741 --> 02:14:04.663]  We should be downsizing, but we're not.
[02:14:04.663 --> 02:14:17.977]  In fact, we have more generals and admirals than we had in World War II, where George Marshall, the most brilliant of all strategists, created two wars in two different arenas, the Pacific and Europe, where we won two wars.
[02:14:17.977 --> 02:14:22.923]  Since that time, as a comment about our military, we have lost every major war.
[02:14:23.503 --> 02:14:27.126]  As General Boykin has said, he was the head of special forces.
[02:14:27.126 --> 02:14:33.050]  And the one I've worked with, we have not won a battle since 1944, the Battle of the Bulge.
[02:14:33.050 --> 02:14:35.812]  That's a very serious indictment of our military.
[02:14:35.812 --> 02:14:42.496]  But at the same time, we have a new breed of military leaders, the likes of which we have not seen before.
[02:14:42.496 --> 02:14:52.183]  Many of them, like Chief Alexander, General Petraeus, many others have PhDs, as well as multiple degrees in strategic analysis.
[02:14:52.763 --> 02:14:54.024]  And it's cyber war.
[02:14:54.024 --> 02:15:17.380]  We're coming into a new era where the gun, the missile, and even the ICBM and the B-52 and the old triad of power that we used to run from the White House under the Nixon, Ford, Reagan administration, the triad of the bombers, the ICBM, the nuclear submarines, the only one left is the nuclear submarine, and that's been supplanted by really cyber war.
[02:15:17.380 --> 02:15:21.763]  And the man who brought it to the forefront in the power structure was really quite the
[02:15:22.143 --> 02:15:22.843]  We're good to go.
[02:15:37.350 --> 02:15:45.976]  Major power would probably be within the National Security Agency, 16 or 15 other intelligence groups, including the civilian CIA.
[02:15:45.976 --> 02:15:59.785]  Now, I have been a fan of the old CIA, where you had people who came out of the OSS, men like Paul Redman, Jim Lilly, Don Gregg, and others, who really came in because they wanted to be dedicated to America.
[02:15:59.785 --> 02:16:06.850]  But unfortunately, over the past 20 to 30 years, the CIA, a civilian organization, became a paramilitary organization.
[02:16:07.350 --> 02:16:07.630]  We're good.
[02:16:24.079 --> 02:16:29.101]  General Dennis Blair and others like myself and other generals feel that this is no longer appropriate.
[02:16:29.101 --> 02:16:32.302]  We need our special forces under total command of the military.
[02:16:32.302 --> 02:16:43.986]  And isn't that a coup of the republic system that George Washington set up in 1776 when he founded the army, which then they immediately then go to the mercenaries and make them the new rock stars?
[02:16:44.706 --> 02:16:57.760]  Up front paying them a bunch, now they don't as much, to suck everyone out of the old republic system into their new private army, which can then be spun off to foreign corporations, and you basically have a soft coup.
[02:16:58.868 --> 02:16:59.869]  Well, that's correct.
[02:16:59.869 --> 02:17:18.585]  What happened, in effect, over the period since 9-11, the most famous stand-down and the one that should receive kudos, and I know Alex is very private about it, he really does deserve the kudos for broadcasting what was the significant message that this was, a stand-down and a false flag.
[02:17:19.125 --> 02:17:20.906]  Since that time, we haven't had that.
[02:17:20.906 --> 02:17:23.608]  We've had deception, denial, and distortion.
[02:17:23.608 --> 02:17:30.272]  But the most important false flag we've had in the 21st century was the 9-11 one in America.
[02:17:30.272 --> 02:17:40.439]  Now, what happened as a result of that is Cheney, who had never served in the military and refused to serve 11 times when he was drafted, yet I and others who were drafted the first time went in.
[02:17:40.939 --> 02:17:41.659]  We've had a complex...
[02:18:02.079 --> 02:18:09.343]  So we've had a military industrial complex that purely was about profit, even if it undermined the overall interest of the United States.
[02:18:09.343 --> 02:18:11.764]  That sounds like killing the golden goose.
[02:18:11.764 --> 02:18:17.387]  Even if I was a sociopathic globalist making billions, I would not want to undermine my main command base.
[02:18:18.356 --> 02:18:19.657]  Well, you're correct, Alex.
[02:18:19.657 --> 02:18:31.626]  The key issue now for America, and why I'm very positive about America, and even more positive about our military, but American citizens have to put a break on what's called the military-industrial complex.
[02:18:31.626 --> 02:18:46.338]  General Eisenhower was clearly a formidable leader, but he was also a formidable American, who was a very down-to-earth individual who said, look, if we don't watch our military-industrial complex, we will erode the basis of the republic.
[02:18:46.869 --> 02:18:52.636]  What is happening now and why we have to be careful is that the republic has turned into an empire.
[02:18:52.636 --> 02:18:55.380]  The empire is out of control with 783 bases in 223 countries.
[02:18:55.380 --> 02:18:55.860]  We are fighting no one.
[02:19:00.032 --> 02:19:04.394]  And actually, we have a Navy that should be denying access to the Chinese.
[02:19:04.394 --> 02:19:11.077]  That's probably the legitimate national security concern we have in South China, which is being negotiated now.
[02:19:11.077 --> 02:19:14.739]  Other than that, we have no real interest in other countries.
[02:19:14.739 --> 02:19:16.900]  ISIS is not a major concern for us.
[02:19:16.900 --> 02:19:18.781]  Israel is not a major concern for us.
[02:19:18.781 --> 02:19:20.962]  The Middle East is not a major concern.
[02:19:20.962 --> 02:19:24.464]  We are a formidable medics order of oil and gas.
[02:19:24.724 --> 02:19:25.144]  I'm good to go.
[02:19:43.156 --> 02:19:44.797]  And why would George Soros
[02:20:12.205 --> 02:20:14.791]  Be trying to block that key pipeline.
[02:20:14.791 --> 02:20:17.457]  How in bed is he with the Chinese?
[02:20:19.275 --> 02:20:21.716]  Obama is not very well in bed with the Chinese.
[02:20:21.716 --> 02:20:23.557]  I have to give him credit.
[02:20:23.557 --> 02:20:26.678]  The Chinese are basically deciding two things.
[02:20:26.678 --> 02:20:39.543]  One, they're putting into position and they're saying to all of their neighbors, primarily Vietnam, which by the way after 30th is being our strongest ally in Southeast Asia, we are going to be parking our military in Vietnam.
[02:20:39.543 --> 02:20:42.324]  We officially don't have bases there because we don't want to...
[02:20:43.544 --> 02:20:49.369]  Yeah, for those that don't know, China's been attacking Vietnam, and people think it's weird that we're teamed up with Vietnam now.
[02:20:49.369 --> 02:20:53.692]  They've been fighting the Chinese for 500 years, and that's why they didn't want us there.
[02:20:53.692 --> 02:20:55.173]  It was always stupid to go there.
[02:20:55.173 --> 02:20:57.255]  If anybody tries to go there, they fight them.
[02:20:57.255 --> 02:21:06.623]  And it's just how bizarre now that you're about to, you know, have these... And why is China making statements like, we may take Philippine islands, we may take Japanese islands?
[02:21:06.623 --> 02:21:08.544]  Why are they escalating the rhetoric?
[02:21:08.544 --> 02:21:10.626]  And what does this gas deal mean with Putin?
[02:21:10.626 --> 02:21:11.927]  And then let's segue into Russia.
[02:21:12.907 --> 02:21:19.189]  Okay, the issue why China is talking as loudly as they are, they have it for internal consumption, not for external.
[02:21:19.189 --> 02:21:25.210]  China right now is not capable of manning an effective fleet against our own fleet.
[02:21:25.210 --> 02:21:38.974]  We had, in effect, our sink pack of Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific has denied access to the most important straits of water, which is the Straits of Malacca, where trade goes through, and 80% of the trade is off protecting Chinese boats.
[02:21:38.974 --> 02:21:42.075]  So if you really want to look at the paradox of the situation,
[02:21:42.555 --> 02:21:47.160]  Our Navy protects Chinese boats that do free trade into Southeast Asia.
[02:21:47.160 --> 02:22:00.533]  The second part is Vietnam is the only country that has defeated five countries, including France, Japan, China twice, and the United States, and they have no animosity to us because they realize that we came in there not as exploiters,
[02:22:01.133 --> 02:22:07.859]  Or as colonialists, it basically is an opportunity and we left, as opposed to the French, whom they really hate.
[02:22:07.859 --> 02:22:15.885]  Now, what happened to China is Putin, because we are decreasing the price of oil, and effectively we are in an economic war.
[02:22:15.885 --> 02:22:16.966]  Let this be understood.
[02:22:16.966 --> 02:22:18.247]  This is not by chance.
[02:22:18.727 --> 02:22:22.229]  Nor was Gorbachev correct about saying this is a new Cold War.
[02:22:22.229 --> 02:22:23.910]  This is not a new Cold War.
[02:22:23.910 --> 02:22:31.414]  Gorbachev knows that he was taken down because we were effective in both the Bush administration and the Reagan administration.
[02:22:31.414 --> 02:22:33.956]  And I must give credit to Bush Sr.
[02:22:33.956 --> 02:22:38.378]  who was exemplary in really running the operations against the Soviet Union.
[02:22:38.378 --> 02:22:39.419]  Let me repeat it again.
[02:22:40.091 --> 02:22:50.866]  Reagan gets proper credit, but the person who did not get proper credit and should be lauded for what was done in the Soviet Union and against the Soviets is George H.W.
[02:22:50.866 --> 02:22:54.431]  Bush, 41, and James Baker, Secretary of State.
[02:22:54.431 --> 02:22:56.594]  These are two exceedingly modest men.
[02:22:56.974 --> 02:23:03.175]  From Texas, who have never asserted their rightful place in the history of the takedown of the Soviet Union.
[02:23:03.175 --> 02:23:18.659]  They were the implementers, they were the ones who provided the overall oversight over my strategy and tactics that were developed at the RAND Corporation, then cooperated by the CIA and the military intelligence, and we effectively took down the Soviet Union against their economic
[02:23:19.099 --> 02:23:19.779]  We're good to go.
[02:23:36.847 --> 02:23:45.370]  And we will stimulate that religion of Greek Orthodox or Russian Orthodox in the Soviet Union, and that was the beginning of the end of the Soviet Union.
[02:23:45.370 --> 02:24:03.637]  So contrary to what Gorbachev would like to believe, or anybody else would like to believe, this was really a group effort on behalf of the CIA, the military intelligence, Bush Senior, Reagan, and Baker, who really carried through an immense amount of heavy-duty work
[02:24:04.252 --> 02:24:18.157]  With multiple coordinates involved in the economic, military, even music we used to show that we could break up the Aparatchiks, which we used to rock and roll, believe it or not, and religion.
[02:24:18.157 --> 02:24:20.778]  So, we're not entering a new Cold War.
[02:24:20.778 --> 02:24:29.961]  What's happening is, because we are a formidable country, and I think everybody should recognize it and enjoy it at this moment, we have created envy.
[02:24:29.961 --> 02:24:32.022]  Envy in this world means that the Russians,
[02:24:32.495 --> 02:24:40.478]  Historically have never been able to equal what we have done despite the fact that we have taken down twice the repressive regime.
[02:24:40.478 --> 02:24:49.301]  And probably Putin will leave within time because he can no longer manage an economic system that's based on the market economy.
[02:24:49.301 --> 02:24:51.802]  Doc, let's shift gears for a moment.
[02:24:51.802 --> 02:24:59.885]  After you finish on Russia, get into though the awakening, the moving back to the States, the Liberty Movement.
[02:25:00.979 --> 02:25:02.219]  What do you think is positive?
[02:25:02.219 --> 02:25:11.482]  Because I see a lot of positive stuff, but the corporate globalist interests that are using the United States like it's evil Frankenstein, they're not giving up.
[02:25:11.482 --> 02:25:12.422]  They're moving forward.
[02:25:12.422 --> 02:25:14.822]  I mean, I see them pulling false flags.
[02:25:14.822 --> 02:25:18.743]  I see them doing economic scams.
[02:25:18.743 --> 02:25:23.144]  But they're also afraid to do big false flags now because they know we're aware of the tricks.
[02:25:23.144 --> 02:25:25.525]  I want to talk about that political landscape as well.
[02:25:26.084 --> 02:25:26.805]  Sure.
[02:25:26.805 --> 02:25:36.834]  The American political landscape, thanks to you and others, quite frankly, what we will call the conspiracy of alternative media, has really become the mainstay.
[02:25:36.834 --> 02:25:49.786]  We took that name, and I thank Alex and others who were involved, and became the mainstay because what in fact happened is we devolved the power all the way from the White House down to the regional governors and then the Commission.
[02:25:50.416 --> 02:26:06.700]  And as a result of the Tea Party movement, which did have an impetus effect, and eventually had lost its usage, it basically stimulated a lot of the grassroots initiatives and the basic underlying Americanism within our people.
[02:26:06.700 --> 02:26:17.943]  That is, we understood that we were being hoodwinked, we understood that we were being lied to, we understood that Obama didn't belong there, we understood that Bush lied to us, we understood that Clinton was immoral.
[02:26:18.403 --> 02:26:20.364]  So what happens in return?
[02:26:20.364 --> 02:26:27.309]  Our reactions come out thanks to people like you who can articulate those feelings and basically state the positions.
[02:26:27.309 --> 02:26:28.790]  We've said no more.
[02:26:28.790 --> 02:26:29.770]  We don't want this.
[02:26:29.770 --> 02:26:30.951]  We don't want the Bushes.
[02:26:30.951 --> 02:26:32.092]  We don't want the Clintons.
[02:26:32.092 --> 02:26:35.113]  And as Barbara Bush said, no more Bushes in the White House.
[02:26:35.113 --> 02:26:36.134]  She's correct.
[02:26:36.134 --> 02:26:38.415]  And I would add no more Clintons in the White House.
[02:26:38.415 --> 02:26:47.161]  So we are beginning to evolve into a new political entity which has greater control at the grassroots level where the corporations are not that effective.
[02:26:47.621 --> 02:26:49.203]  That's why they have gone overseas.
[02:26:49.203 --> 02:26:57.652]  But what happened when they went overseas is they forgot that the American worker is the most efficient, fast, entrepreneurial worker in the world.
[02:26:57.652 --> 02:27:01.857]  When he went to China, the corporation, they came back with very poor product.
[02:27:01.857 --> 02:27:05.101]  When they went to India, they came back with medicines that were highly
[02:27:06.162 --> 02:27:08.405]  Uh, diluted by other products.
[02:27:08.405 --> 02:27:14.792]  So the American corporation suddenly said, wait a minute, Europe is going into devaluation and deflation.
[02:27:14.792 --> 02:27:18.717]  China's heading into deflation and a problem with their environment.
[02:27:18.717 --> 02:27:20.900]  We're coming back to the United States.
[02:27:20.900 --> 02:27:24.564]  So what's happened is the corporation, our economic cowards.
[02:27:24.564 --> 02:27:25.105]  What do I mean?
[02:27:26.263 --> 02:27:30.825]  Companies like Pfizer take what's called an inversion technique.
[02:27:30.825 --> 02:27:38.248]  They basically buy out a company like AstraZeneca, which is not a very effective pharmaceutical company, because of the tax advantage.
[02:27:38.248 --> 02:27:48.472]  And without leaving their own base, they go from a 35% tax rate down to a 15% tax rate, even though they've done nothing more than ship paperwork in New York.
[02:27:48.472 --> 02:27:49.513]  That has to change.
[02:27:49.913 --> 02:27:56.057]  The American public is basically subsidizing big corporation and big pharma, which doesn't deserve it.
[02:27:56.057 --> 02:28:06.303]  Despite what they say to you and they say to me as a physician, they have not developed all these medications on the basis of FDA research and on the basis of NIH.
[02:28:06.303 --> 02:28:11.345]  They developed it on the basis of having side effects and their own greed.
[02:28:11.345 --> 02:28:15.428]  So what I'm saying, the American public is a very effective instrument
[02:28:15.848 --> 02:28:21.251]  For brooking these big industries, for being able to stop them, for saying, okay, that's enough.
[02:28:21.251 --> 02:28:31.417]  We may not always agree with Obama, yet nevertheless, the economic warfare is effective against the Soviet Union, I mean, against Russia, and Putin is crying out.
[02:28:31.417 --> 02:28:32.457]  He needs help.
[02:28:32.457 --> 02:28:39.501]  The Chinese need help now, because we're going to fast-track that trade, and that means a lot more for the political power base in the United States.
[02:28:40.043 --> 02:28:45.386]  We are now the only people that have had increase in our growth development.
[02:28:45.386 --> 02:28:53.050]  We've had a decrease in unemployment and really in relation to Europe and China and the world, we're doing much better.
[02:28:53.050 --> 02:29:00.534]  Even though there's the ISIS and Ebola, we're able to transport beyond that and get back into our work.
[02:29:00.534 --> 02:29:04.836]  And that's where the beauty is.
[02:29:04.836 --> 02:29:05.797]  We're just going to break here.
[02:29:07.401 --> 02:29:07.961]  We're going to break.
[02:29:07.961 --> 02:29:10.202]  When we come back, I want you to finish up and we're going to give us some phone calls.
[02:29:10.202 --> 02:29:13.263]  We're also going to talk about your medical company, which we've never talked about.
[02:29:13.263 --> 02:29:22.805]  But before we go there, I want to specifically, though, get into what I call this fascist, leftist ideology.
[02:29:22.805 --> 02:29:24.586]  I don't even call it socialist.
[02:29:26.092 --> 02:29:31.736]  Where they get off on trying to destroy the family, messing with men, messing with women.
[02:29:31.736 --> 02:29:36.780]  The attempt to screw up families and to screw up the society.
[02:29:36.780 --> 02:29:41.103]  This is what you do to a foreign enemy and I would call that an immoral tactic.
[02:29:41.103 --> 02:29:46.146]  Why are they using those type of psyops to degenerate society here?
[02:29:46.146 --> 02:29:47.828]  Why is the political class doing that?
[02:29:47.828 --> 02:29:48.848]  We'll talk to the doctor.
[02:29:48.848 --> 02:29:49.709]  We're on the march.
[02:29:49.709 --> 02:29:52.251]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.251 --> 02:29:54.913]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:30:11.638 --> 02:30:17.841]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the Infowarslife line because they are not of
[02:30:17.841 --> 02:30:18.041]  Of course.
[02:30:38.872 --> 02:30:49.681]  I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited Infowarslife.com and believed in us and tried the products.

[02:30:59.312 --> 02:31:02.974]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:31:02.974 --> 02:31:07.257]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:31:07.257 --> 02:31:09.038]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:31:09.038 --> 02:31:14.361]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[02:31:14.361 --> 02:31:16.903]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.
[02:31:16.903 --> 02:31:18.044]  But for how long?

[02:31:58.513 --> 02:32:00.474]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[02:32:00.474 --> 02:32:05.016]  When cells become toxic, they die early, and aging sets in.
[02:32:05.016 --> 02:32:09.479]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[02:32:09.479 --> 02:32:16.782]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[02:32:16.782 --> 02:32:25.847]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:32:26.067 --> 02:32:31.610]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.

[02:33:27.393 --> 02:33:33.896]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:33.896 --> 02:33:36.256]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:45.345 --> 02:33:47.608]  To some people, this sounds like nails on a chalkboard.
[02:33:47.608 --> 02:33:56.078]  It sounds like heaven to me.
[02:33:56.078 --> 02:34:00.643]  I got to tell ya, poker is his game.
[02:34:00.643 --> 02:34:03.907]  Monday through Friday from 11am to 2pm Central.
[02:34:05.023 --> 02:34:08.024]  We are here, live, weeknight, 7 o'clock central.
[02:34:08.024 --> 02:34:09.864]  I want to go to your phone calls.
[02:34:09.864 --> 02:34:17.627]  I want to talk to Dr. Pucinich about the question I was throwing at him back as we went to break, and then I forgot.
[02:34:17.627 --> 02:34:18.727]  What was the question?
[02:34:18.727 --> 02:34:23.789]  It was an important question, and I wanted him to think about it, and I want to see if he remembers what the question was.
[02:34:23.789 --> 02:34:25.049]  It'll pop in my head in a second.
[02:34:25.549 --> 02:34:27.010]  This is teleprompter free, folks.
[02:34:27.010 --> 02:34:29.311]  So, I mean, you're really getting what I think here.
[02:34:29.311 --> 02:34:32.113]  So sometimes I forget what I was talking about earlier.
[02:34:32.113 --> 02:34:36.736]  But we'll see if Dr. Pachunik remembers the question I was asking him.
[02:34:36.736 --> 02:34:39.197]  And I'm also a little bit selfish, too.
[02:34:39.197 --> 02:34:44.961]  I know he's got two products that are world-renowned and are best sellers around the planet.
[02:34:44.961 --> 02:34:49.444]  He's into nutraceuticals as well as a medical doctor and psychiatrist.
[02:34:49.444 --> 02:34:52.466]  And so I want to pick his brain about that as well.
[02:34:53.206 --> 02:35:02.130]  You know, didn't just produce movies and write a bunch of books with Tom Clancy and, you know, run the State Department's PsyOps and do the Camp David Accords and all the amazing things he's done.
[02:35:02.130 --> 02:35:04.612]  Much of it classified so we can't talk about it.
[02:35:04.612 --> 02:35:07.073]  He also has a very successful nutraceutical company.
[02:35:07.073 --> 02:35:13.216]  And that's what we have at Infowarslife.com is the most cutting-edge, documented products.
[02:35:13.216 --> 02:35:15.217]  And Pachinick said something so interesting during the break.
[02:35:15.217 --> 02:35:17.738]  He said, he said, well, Alex, I said, well, why are you so successful?
[02:35:17.738 --> 02:35:19.659]  He goes, really, no marketing, nothing.
[02:35:19.659 --> 02:35:20.780]  He goes, it's word of mouth.
[02:35:21.400 --> 02:35:24.882]  He started out selling almost none of it and it just slowly grew over the years.
[02:35:24.882 --> 02:35:25.942]  He was telling me what they sell a day.
[02:35:25.942 --> 02:35:28.183]  It's just, it's incredible.
[02:35:28.183 --> 02:35:29.304]  And that's word of mouth.
[02:35:29.304 --> 02:35:30.805]  See, we're the same thing here.
[02:35:30.805 --> 02:35:40.450]  A lot of nutraceutical companies just put out the basic thing they can or they put out crud or they put out synthetic stuff because they want to use marketing to do it.
[02:35:40.450 --> 02:35:41.730]  No, we don't use marketing.
[02:35:41.730 --> 02:35:42.751]  We use, hey,
[02:35:44.515 --> 02:35:46.536]  This is really high quality, just try it.
[02:35:46.536 --> 02:36:05.022]  And then people get results at InfoWarsLife.com with the great products that are there, whether it's the Oxy Powder, Survival Shield, or DNA Force, or whether it's the Lung Cleanse, or whether it's the Fluoride Shield, Chelating Detoxifier, or Colloidal Silver, the 300 parts per million.
[02:36:05.882 --> 02:36:20.510]  Nanosilver, just all of it is stuff that's been known to have really good effects across the board and that is that we can also then get the very best of and bring you at competitive prices at Infowarslife.com.
[02:36:20.510 --> 02:36:21.771]  You can also call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:36:21.771 --> 02:36:22.231]  But Dr. Pachinnik,
[02:36:26.674 --> 02:36:33.644]  Tell me about your line of nutraceutical supplements because, I mean, I know that it's very, very popular.
[02:36:33.644 --> 02:36:36.649]  People have gotten great results with it, and I'm interested.
[02:36:36.649 --> 02:36:39.874]  Maybe you can work with us and help us formulate something, Dr. Pachinik.
[02:36:40.643 --> 02:36:41.463]  Well, it's a pleasure.
[02:36:41.463 --> 02:36:50.207]  Let me first state that, Alex, the question you asked me was about the nature of the left wing distorting the values of the American people.
[02:36:50.207 --> 02:36:50.488]  Oh, yeah!
[02:36:50.488 --> 02:36:51.968]  I mean, why do they come out and brag?
[02:36:51.968 --> 02:36:53.669]  Yes, Obamacare's meant to bankrupt you.
[02:36:53.669 --> 02:36:55.150]  The reason is very simple.
[02:36:55.150 --> 02:36:58.211]  The reason is we're basically a Christian country.
[02:36:58.211 --> 02:37:02.373]  What happens in a Christian country is not that everyone is Christian in religion.
[02:37:02.373 --> 02:37:03.794]  They can be atheists.
[02:37:03.794 --> 02:37:08.816]  But what the statement of Christianity is about is the statement of certain values that hold true.
[02:37:09.594 --> 02:37:17.076]  The very roots of what our country was based on, which is the family is a central value of the organization, the community.
[02:37:17.076 --> 02:37:22.118]  The community is a central element of the state and the county.
[02:37:22.118 --> 02:37:24.939]  And the states are a central element of the republic.
[02:37:24.939 --> 02:37:29.860]  So when you have these values, you learn what is appropriate, what is not appropriate.
[02:37:30.503 --> 02:37:31.544]  I think so.
[02:37:49.051 --> 02:37:53.816]  We have always had internal wars between one ideology and another ideology.
[02:37:53.816 --> 02:38:04.527]  I have always had faith that the American public will reaffirm its basic beliefs and that we're a Judeo-Christian country which rises on values of both religions.
[02:38:04.527 --> 02:38:06.629]  And that doesn't mean that you can't be an atheist.
[02:38:07.009 --> 02:38:13.851]  It can be, as long as you understand the precepts and the conduct of behavior that those religions mandate.
[02:38:13.851 --> 02:38:16.091]  In other words, treat others as you would treat yourself.
[02:38:16.091 --> 02:38:16.692]  The Golden Rule.
[02:38:16.692 --> 02:38:27.854]  Well, that's what I'm getting at is, it's very Soviet-style, but also fascist, the way they persecute people and want to arrest preachers that, you know, read out of the Bible in Houston.
[02:38:27.854 --> 02:38:29.575]  They want to subpoena them and want to
[02:38:29.995 --> 02:38:32.438]  Make you talk away and adopt their language.
[02:38:32.438 --> 02:38:33.599]  That's not liberal.
[02:38:33.599 --> 02:38:35.982]  Thomas Jefferson was a liberal.
[02:38:35.982 --> 02:38:44.853]  These people are just sickening autocratic control freaks engaged in what I'd call bullying attempts at cultural overrides.
[02:38:46.052 --> 02:38:51.555]  Well, the point here is, where there is always strife, there's always opportunity for America.
[02:38:51.555 --> 02:38:56.677]  This is where we have the opportunity to fight back, be it on the right or the left.
[02:38:56.677 --> 02:39:06.062]  If somebody tried to suppress a minister who wants to read from the Bible or whatever time, then he has the right to exert his right and to fight for that right.
[02:39:06.062 --> 02:39:10.844]  Within the doctrines of the American Constitution and our Declaration of Independence,
[02:39:11.144 --> 02:39:13.685]  Those are the mandates that are given to us.
[02:39:13.685 --> 02:39:25.028]  That's why the federal government is becoming weaker and weaker, and what's happening is now judges and judicial courts are beginning to make mandates that have no relevance to everyday living.
[02:39:25.028 --> 02:39:32.689]  Whether Roberts says that a company is a person is absolutely ridiculous, and probably will be changed.
[02:39:32.689 --> 02:39:38.491]  But in turn, that has affected the way we have voted, and that's affected the way the candidates have come forth.
[02:39:38.971 --> 02:39:50.362]  But my faith in the American public is that it really will revolve around things that are anti-fascist, anti-depression, anti-repression, simply because that's the way we grew up.
[02:39:50.362 --> 02:39:56.027]  The problem for the most of the world is that they cannot mirror the notion of the individuality of the American people.
[02:39:57.364 --> 02:39:59.965]  Be it black, white, green, yellow or red.
[02:39:59.965 --> 02:40:02.046]  That's why people want to come to this country.
[02:40:02.046 --> 02:40:03.567]  It will always remain that way.
[02:40:03.567 --> 02:40:05.328]  We will always struggle with them.
[02:40:05.328 --> 02:40:12.071]  Sure, why would our elites and the Republicans working with them try to fundamentally dumb people down and screw the country up?
[02:40:12.071 --> 02:40:16.393]  That is such a premeditated vandalism of the culture.
[02:40:16.393 --> 02:40:21.816]  It just, it repudiates the people running things and shows that they're the lowest form of scum.
[02:40:22.864 --> 02:40:26.748]  Well, if you have nothing else to do, you run for Congress and a Senator.
[02:40:26.748 --> 02:40:39.102]  Most people that I've treated who are professional politicians really have never started their own business, have never had day-to-day concerns like you and I, where we have to meet a payroll, we have to meet financial obligations.
[02:40:39.102 --> 02:40:43.927]  Most of them are very entitled, very lazy, and very scared to go out into the real world
[02:40:44.537 --> 02:40:45.118]  I think so.
[02:41:00.974 --> 02:41:10.247]  So what we have to look for now is somebody who's really been in the executive branch or the management branch of any company or state.
[02:41:10.247 --> 02:41:12.170]  Yeah, why is it always lawyers?
[02:41:12.170 --> 02:41:16.095]  Why don't we have like, you know, corporate people or business people or...
[02:41:16.476 --> 02:41:18.297]  Well, the lawyers are basically creating their own game.
[02:41:18.297 --> 02:41:23.619]  You play within the law, you play within a kabuki that's corrupt and distorted.
[02:41:44.000 --> 02:42:02.598]  It's an open-ended game that has its own rules, but now you've got Rand Paul, you've got a lot of doctors now in Congress, you're going to have CPAs at the local level here, at the commissioner level, and we need more managers literally at jobs, and now we have the head of the VA who's come out of Procter & Gamble.
[02:42:02.598 --> 02:42:05.380]  We're going to have businessmen running forth.
[02:42:07.102 --> 02:42:09.544]  You know, Romney was an example of a businessman.
[02:42:09.544 --> 02:42:11.925]  John Huntsman was an example of a businessman.
[02:42:11.925 --> 02:42:17.950]  America turned them down for a man who had no history and no practical application.
[02:42:17.950 --> 02:42:21.592]  So the question becomes, are we going to repeat this again?
[02:42:21.592 --> 02:42:26.836]  Are we going to vote in somebody who's singular because of their color or their gender?
[02:42:26.836 --> 02:42:32.120]  Or are we going to bring in somebody who understands finances, management, and implementation?
[02:42:32.120 --> 02:42:33.501]  That's the decision America has to make.
[02:42:33.641 --> 02:42:39.769]  Now, because you've come on over the years, for 14 years or 13 years, and never plugged anything.
[02:42:39.769 --> 02:42:41.812]  I mean, I do find your company interesting.
[02:42:41.812 --> 02:42:42.553]  Tell us the name of it.
[02:42:42.553 --> 02:42:44.195]  We'll put the website up on screen.
[02:42:44.195 --> 02:42:45.837]  Tell us about your nutrition.
[02:42:49.462 --> 02:42:56.443]  We're a company with a brilliant naturopath named John Neustadt and we developed two key products.
[02:42:56.443 --> 02:43:01.024]  One was MK-4 or Osteo-K which was used for osteoporosis.
[02:43:01.024 --> 02:43:03.004]  We didn't initiate that product.
[02:43:03.004 --> 02:43:11.066]  We took it in from Japan that we have used for 30 years for the treatment of osteoporosis and the prevention of fractures.
[02:43:11.066 --> 02:43:18.927]  We don't worry about the bone density as much as we worry about decreasing fractures and we found that we can decrease fractures.
[02:43:19.406 --> 02:43:20.146]  Significantly.
[02:43:20.146 --> 02:43:30.728]  At the same time, we've gotten initial approval by the FDA for the treatment of acute myelocytic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, which are very important issues.
[02:43:30.728 --> 02:43:35.149]  And people all over the world have now been buying this up in the hundreds and thousands.
[02:43:35.149 --> 02:43:41.011]  And as I said to Alex, you know, I really don't watch the company because it works by itself.
[02:43:41.011 --> 02:43:46.532]  It's word of mouth and the other product is Mitophor, which is amazing, a mitochondrial
[02:43:47.188 --> 02:43:48.429]  We're good to go!
[02:44:07.843 --> 02:44:12.788]  And this company has been very successful because of word of mouth and because the products do work.
[02:44:12.788 --> 02:44:15.490]  And we don't claim that we discovered the initial product.
[02:44:15.490 --> 02:44:28.381]  We claim that we formulated it and made it pure and potent, which means it's very rare in America to have products which are literally not diluted with other brands, other lower quality products.
[02:44:28.381 --> 02:44:33.225]  We guarantee the highest quality made in the United States and its performance guaranteed.
[02:44:33.365 --> 02:44:39.068]  Well, I'm very interested in it because I look at the formulations, they're amazing, and I know how successful it is in just eight years.
[02:44:39.068 --> 02:44:51.854]  I mean, we follow at Infowarslife.com the very same ideas, the very same principles, and it is all about word of mouth, and that's why being moral is a win-win-win for the customers, for yourself, for everybody.
[02:44:51.854 --> 02:44:57.917]  I mean, that's the only karma or mojo, reap what you sow, that I want, is serious high quality.
[02:44:59.418 --> 02:45:04.121]  All these attempts to suppress these type of things, but I see that being defeated as well.
[02:45:04.121 --> 02:45:08.884]  So, the moral of the story is, there's not just evil in this world, there's good as well.
[02:45:08.884 --> 02:45:10.085]  Now listen, I want to get the calls.
[02:45:10.085 --> 02:45:11.706]  I don't want to hog everybody here.
[02:45:11.706 --> 02:45:14.908]  Renee, David, Wayne, Douglas, Daniel.
[02:45:14.908 --> 02:45:20.111]  Who's been holding the longest here, John?
[02:45:20.111 --> 02:45:21.752]  Reena in Canada.
[02:45:21.752 --> 02:45:23.113]  Okay, Reena in Canada.
[02:45:23.113 --> 02:45:25.634]  The guy in Thailand had to hang up.
[02:45:25.634 --> 02:45:26.935]  Okay, Reena in Canada.
[02:45:26.935 --> 02:45:28.276]  Go ahead, you're on the air with Dr. Pachinik.
[02:45:29.261 --> 02:45:30.422]  Okay, you can hear me?
[02:45:30.422 --> 02:45:31.823]  Yes, I can, ma'am.
[02:45:31.823 --> 02:45:43.912]  Okay, so, um, I just, I kind of have a small, uh, testimonial about vaccines and then I'm just wondering, uh, how they can get away with this stuff.
[02:45:43.912 --> 02:45:54.620]  Um, two years ago when my son was two and a half, he was given a vaccine and then the next day when he got out of the bath, his legs started wobbling and he just, like, fell over.
[02:45:55.664 --> 02:45:58.985]  And 20 minutes later he was really hot.
[02:45:58.985 --> 02:46:01.306]  I ended up having to call 9-1-1.
[02:46:01.306 --> 02:46:03.506]  While I was waiting his lips turned blue.
[02:46:03.506 --> 02:46:06.227]  It was like the scariest day of my life.
[02:46:06.227 --> 02:46:07.567]  We got to the hospital.
[02:46:07.567 --> 02:46:08.888]  They did all kinds of tests.
[02:46:08.888 --> 02:46:11.208]  They couldn't find anything wrong with him.
[02:46:11.208 --> 02:46:16.930]  And then I started researching vaccines and I found out it says right in the inserts that they cause seizures.
[02:46:17.530 --> 02:46:20.431]  And I'm just wondering how they could be constantly injured.
[02:46:20.431 --> 02:46:24.352]  Well, almost everyone I know that's ill got a vaccine, adult or child.
[02:46:24.352 --> 02:46:26.452]  They get Guillain-Barré, narcolepsy.
[02:46:26.452 --> 02:46:28.393]  They can't drive cars anymore.
[02:46:28.393 --> 02:46:30.253]  They get epilepsy from it.
[02:46:30.253 --> 02:46:32.054]  They get cancer from it.
[02:46:32.054 --> 02:46:33.034]  People's kids are fine.
[02:46:33.034 --> 02:46:35.374]  Their brain damaged, the blood coming out their nose the next day.
[02:46:35.374 --> 02:46:37.635]  I mean, it is a curse.
[02:46:37.635 --> 02:46:40.996]  And again, I'm not saying vaccines aren't a real technology.
[02:46:40.996 --> 02:46:45.657]  It's just that whatever's going into them, whatever's happening, I wouldn't take a vaccine
[02:46:47.937 --> 02:46:49.058]  My life depended on it.
[02:46:49.058 --> 02:46:50.998]  I don't know Dr. Pachinick's view on this.
[02:46:50.998 --> 02:46:53.899]  Dr. Pachinick, your view on immunization?
[02:46:53.899 --> 02:47:04.642]  Well, on a collective level, we need to immunize our children, otherwise we're going to have an outbreak of what I've seen when I grew up, which is polio, measles, mumps.
[02:47:04.642 --> 02:47:08.383]  It is not a very good epidemic to have.
[02:47:08.383 --> 02:47:12.644]  On the other hand, you do have concerns and side effects, so you really have to study
[02:47:13.385 --> 02:47:19.467]  Find out how much thermosol and how much mercury there is in the vaccine and whether there's a variation of it.
[02:47:19.467 --> 02:47:20.387]  Well, that's the thing though.
[02:47:20.387 --> 02:47:25.008]  They lie and say, so you're honest, like doctors always were, and said, yeah, there's a cost-benefit.
[02:47:25.008 --> 02:47:27.469]  Now they just say, hey, there's no side effects.
[02:47:27.469 --> 02:47:28.510]  Trust is taken.
[02:47:28.510 --> 02:47:30.370]  And when you get hurt, they try to deny it.
[02:47:30.370 --> 02:47:31.871]  Here's an example.
[02:47:31.871 --> 02:47:34.891]  They never said give pregnant women vaccines until six years ago.
[02:47:34.891 --> 02:47:36.852]  Now they say give them extra.
[02:47:36.852 --> 02:47:38.392]  Now, I've talked to medical doctors on air.
[02:47:38.392 --> 02:47:39.333]  They say that's crazy.
[02:47:39.333 --> 02:47:39.793]  What do you say?
[02:47:41.260 --> 02:47:49.746]  Well, I haven't given it, you know, I've just given vaccines to myself and my family, and fortunately nothing has happened, but I can't get into the details of vaccines.
[02:47:49.746 --> 02:47:59.352]  I've not been privy to all the studies, but I do know from an epidemiological point of view that we do have to contain certain problems.
[02:47:59.352 --> 02:48:00.813]  One is flu.
[02:48:00.813 --> 02:48:03.394]  Spanish flu has killed over 20 million people in 1990.
[02:48:05.435 --> 02:48:07.536]  We have some control over that now.
[02:48:07.536 --> 02:48:12.959]  Yeah, I think the issue is the vaccine companies have been given protections where they can't get sued basically.
[02:48:12.959 --> 02:48:17.581]  Remember Porton Down and BioPort and the troops getting hurt with bad vaccines?
[02:48:17.581 --> 02:48:20.042]  I think the issue is they're allowed to put out crap, Doc.
[02:48:21.001 --> 02:48:22.762]  Well, that's the problem of the FDA.
[02:48:22.762 --> 02:48:25.883]  The FDA has to monitor this more effectively.
[02:48:25.883 --> 02:48:27.604]  Can we monitor more effectively?
[02:48:27.604 --> 02:48:28.284]  Yes.
[02:48:28.284 --> 02:48:30.365]  Will I speak on behalf of the FDA?
[02:48:30.365 --> 02:48:31.085]  No.
[02:48:31.085 --> 02:48:37.428]  I think Margaret Hamburger has to address these issues as to where the vaccines have to be improved.
[02:48:37.428 --> 02:48:40.609]  Well, that lady already hung up, but I wanted to hear from her if her son got better.
[02:48:40.609 --> 02:48:42.129]  We're so sorry, ma'am.
[02:48:42.129 --> 02:48:43.870]  Look, it's cause and effect.
[02:48:43.870 --> 02:48:45.511]  Take the shot, have the convulsion.
[02:48:45.511 --> 02:48:48.032]  And it's an autoimmune response in the brain, according to medical doctors.
[02:48:48.832 --> 02:48:49.733]  And I get the fact.
[02:48:49.733 --> 02:48:51.574]  I wish vaccines were safe and effective.
[02:48:51.574 --> 02:48:52.735]  I would take them.
[02:48:52.735 --> 02:48:57.599]  It's just that the damage, I believe, is starting to outweigh what they claim the good is, Doc.
[02:48:57.599 --> 02:48:59.320]  Let's talk to Daniel in Colorado.
[02:48:59.320 --> 02:49:02.142]  You're on the air with Dr. Pichennik.
[02:49:02.142 --> 02:49:03.423]  Hello, Alex.
[02:49:03.423 --> 02:49:05.805]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:49:05.805 --> 02:49:08.587]  I'm calling from Durango, Colorado.
[02:49:08.587 --> 02:49:17.474]  And here in the local paper, the Durango Herald, they put out an article stating drones take to the sky.
[02:49:18.446 --> 02:49:24.073]  And how they're selling this is how it will be beneficial for wildfires.
[02:49:24.073 --> 02:49:28.398]  How they can locate the hotspots and go in and pit them out.
[02:49:28.398 --> 02:49:31.781]  You know, we see the police state forming.
[02:49:31.781 --> 02:49:34.785]  We see Marshall Law on the horizon.
[02:49:34.785 --> 02:49:37.248]  What are your thoughts on drones?
[02:49:38.343 --> 02:49:39.084]  That's a good point.
[02:49:39.084 --> 02:49:46.688]  Whenever we showed about five years ago or four years ago that they're planning to use drones to surveil farmers and harass people, they had the media say it wasn't true.
[02:49:46.688 --> 02:49:48.089]  Now they're launching them.
[02:49:48.089 --> 02:49:51.832]  Dr. Pucinich, what is your concern on drones, the police state, you name it?
[02:49:51.832 --> 02:49:57.135]  Because there is an awakening happening, but the system tends to, you know, try to set up an oppression system.
[02:49:58.134 --> 02:50:05.478]  Well, what's happening is, the more the police state tries to set up an oppressive system, the more faulty it becomes.
[02:50:05.478 --> 02:50:10.341]  In other words, the bigger it becomes in some ways, the American public should be grateful.
[02:50:10.341 --> 02:50:13.023]  It really doesn't function as size increases.
[02:50:13.023 --> 02:50:15.324]  It becomes more ineffectual.
[02:50:15.324 --> 02:50:16.285]  I'll give you an example.
[02:50:16.994 --> 02:50:26.098]  A day, 20, 30 years ago, they may have collected the National Security Agency 1 million bits of information in a minute that they might have been able to monitor.
[02:50:26.098 --> 02:50:31.280]  Now they're collecting billions of bits of information which has no relevancy to anything.
[02:50:31.280 --> 02:50:35.801]  With the issue of drones, it's a fascinating phenomenon because now you can buy a drone for $300.
[02:50:37.402 --> 02:50:42.685]  People can actually have their own drones taking pictures, so I think it's a new era.
[02:50:42.685 --> 02:50:46.147]  I think it's equally... I'll tell you what, stay there, stay there.
[02:50:46.147 --> 02:50:49.188]  I want to come back and have you finish up, Dr. Puccini.
[02:50:49.188 --> 02:50:57.332]  I had a drone fly into my property, up to my house, through the window, and it got away before I could get it.
[02:50:57.332 --> 02:50:58.053]  But that did happen.
[02:50:59.227 --> 02:51:01.948]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[02:51:01.948 --> 02:51:06.249]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.

[02:51:28.891 --> 02:51:32.272]  I am a 47-year-old female and had a heart attack in 2005.
[02:51:32.272 --> 02:51:35.593]  This is Alice from New Jersey.
[02:51:35.593 --> 02:51:38.774]  I still get angina, even with four stents.
[02:51:38.774 --> 02:51:41.695]  I was taking nitro two or three times a week.
[02:51:41.695 --> 02:51:46.716]  The very first day after taking Heart and Body Extract, the chest pain was gone.
[02:51:46.716 --> 02:51:48.677]  Now I don't wear a nitro patch.

[02:54:08.948 --> 02:54:20.736]  Well, we've been getting Dr. Steve Pchenik's perspective today.
[02:54:20.736 --> 02:54:23.819]  We've got six minutes left and we'll take a few more calls for him.
[02:54:23.819 --> 02:54:27.161]  StevePchenik.com is his site.
[02:54:27.161 --> 02:54:29.523]  Doc, anything else you want to add before we talk to Wayne and David?
[02:54:31.096 --> 02:54:34.758]  Uh, no, I'm very pleased to answer the question and honored to be on your show.
[02:54:34.758 --> 02:54:37.099]  Honored to have you.
[02:54:37.099 --> 02:54:40.561]  Wayne in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:54:40.561 --> 02:54:44.543]  Uh, yeah, Alex, I want to share something real quick and then I've got a question.
[02:54:44.543 --> 02:54:48.125]  Uh, I've seen some things out here 70 miles from your location.
[02:54:48.125 --> 02:54:59.111]  Uh, I've seen two spacecraft out here, man, but I, just three days ago, I saw what looked like a B-52 Silver fuselage flying over me.
[02:54:59.804 --> 02:55:05.126]  And what fell out of the sky was like a giant sperm.
[02:55:05.126 --> 02:55:12.249]  I mean, it was odd, but it had a tail like a web, like a spider web almost.
[02:55:12.249 --> 02:55:14.909]  I'm seeing things out here that are unbelievable.
[02:55:14.909 --> 02:55:21.392]  So I believe they have technology beyond our understanding.
[02:55:21.392 --> 02:55:24.233]  I'll tell you, you saw what dropping giant sperm out of the sky?
[02:55:25.174 --> 02:55:30.738]  Well, these things had like an egg shack on one end and a tail that came off of it.
[02:55:30.738 --> 02:55:34.922]  I mean, it looked like a huge sperm, but it was odd.
[02:55:34.922 --> 02:55:36.963]  I wish I'd got pictures.
[02:55:36.963 --> 02:55:39.865]  Sounds like some kind of mid-air refueling deal.
[02:55:39.865 --> 02:55:41.627]  Very, very strange.
[02:55:41.627 --> 02:55:43.948]  What was your question for Dr. Pchenik?
[02:55:43.948 --> 02:55:52.235]  Well, I'm concerned about the psychology that we can't get beyond between the believers and the non-believers of what's going on here.
[02:55:52.959 --> 02:55:58.741]  And does this relate to revelation in that some men's minds are seared?
[02:55:58.741 --> 02:55:59.661]  The great delusion.
[02:55:59.661 --> 02:56:01.841]  Yeah, given the great delusion.
[02:56:01.841 --> 02:56:03.942]  Let me ask Pchenik that then, in the time.
[02:56:03.942 --> 02:56:05.042]  Thank you, caller.
[02:56:05.042 --> 02:56:05.802]  There's some video of that.
[02:56:05.802 --> 02:56:08.203]  I'd like to see it.
[02:56:08.203 --> 02:56:15.565]  Dr. Pchenik, how do you get people who have cognitive dissonance and are in denial to wake up and admit this stuff's going on?
[02:56:18.294 --> 02:56:27.981]  Well, it takes an incident and it takes a shock for them to suddenly realize that there's one thing they believe and then the phenomenon is not according to their beliefs.
[02:56:27.981 --> 02:56:37.108]  Like 9-11, everybody felt, oh, it's not possible because it takes too many people to be in a conspiracy, and we don't do that, and the American government doesn't do that.
[02:56:37.108 --> 02:56:46.615]  Then finally, Alex Jones comes forth, or Dr. Pchenik, and then what happened is engineers and architects from all over the United States, hundreds of them said, look,
[02:56:47.988 --> 02:56:53.236]  The fact that a building 40 stories high comes down in 10 seconds is not possible.
[02:56:53.236 --> 02:56:54.318]  This is what happened.
[02:56:54.318 --> 02:56:57.283]  And then eventually that cognitive dissonance of non-belief
[02:56:58.174 --> 02:57:06.278]  Phenomenal how you destroy a building and the fact that a third building was blown up without any effect, that breaks the target of discipline.
[02:57:06.278 --> 02:57:06.658]  That's right.
[02:57:06.658 --> 02:57:14.261]  Eventually people begin to say, oh my god, you know, our country does go against us and therefore we must protect us.
[02:57:14.261 --> 02:57:20.124]  And that's why you and I are here to basically attempt to break that denial, but it takes time.
[02:57:20.124 --> 02:57:21.645]  David Louisiana, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:57:22.987 --> 02:57:24.948]  Hey, this is David with the NOLA Report.
[02:57:24.948 --> 02:57:27.650]  I got to interview John McCain about Benghazi.
[02:57:27.650 --> 02:57:29.010]  Good job.
[02:57:29.010 --> 02:57:47.041]  Yeah, I got to speak to an establishment Republican one night at a Congressional Victory Party, and I was picking his brains about a lot of topics, and he said, one of them was Russia, and he said that we should go in and kill every single one of the rebels in the Donetsk region.
[02:57:47.041 --> 02:57:48.862]  The first question to Mr. Pchenik is,
[02:57:49.383 --> 02:57:53.349]  Do you think we should cut off the Russian pipeline in that region?
[02:57:53.349 --> 02:58:04.166]  And the second one is, we always associate communism with Democrats, but do you believe that there are fascists in the establishment Republican Party, or are they just crony capitalists?
[02:58:05.563 --> 02:58:07.125]  Well, I think there are two good questions.
[02:58:07.125 --> 02:58:10.288]  Number one, we don't have to do anything physically to Putin.
[02:58:10.288 --> 02:58:13.651]  We're doing it already psychologically and economically.
[02:58:13.651 --> 02:58:21.640]  When he dropped the price of oil below $90 per barrel, that's the first red line for him.
[02:58:21.640 --> 02:58:24.543]  And the second red line is that the Kremlin, we know,
[02:58:25.513 --> 02:58:27.935]  But is that moral?
[02:58:27.935 --> 02:58:29.777]  What did they do to us?
[02:58:29.777 --> 02:58:31.859]  I'm gonna come back and ask you that straight ahead.
[02:58:31.859 --> 02:58:32.540]  70 seconds.
[02:58:32.540 --> 02:58:33.160]  We're back folks.
[02:58:33.160 --> 02:58:33.541]  Infowars.com.
[02:58:49.389 --> 02:58:56.051]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:58:56.051 --> 02:59:01.192]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:59:01.192 --> 02:59:16.256]  There's a place down in Tennessee Where they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit
[02:59:18.420 --> 02:59:30.205]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:59:30.205 --> 02:59:32.006]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:59:32.006 --> 02:59:34.867]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:59:34.867 --> 02:59:38.928]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[02:59:38.928 --> 02:59:41.509]  So you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:59:41.509 --> 02:59:44.211]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:59:44.211 --> 02:59:45.791]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:59:45.791 --> 02:59:46.571]  Got it.
[02:59:46.571 --> 02:59:47.432]  Others don't.
[02:59:50.906 --> 02:59:53.522]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:11.249 --> 03:00:12.770]  Fix bayonets.
[03:00:12.770 --> 03:00:20.332]  We are now entering overdrive with your host, Alex Jones, broadcasting live from the front lines.
[03:00:20.332 --> 03:00:24.974]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:24.974 --> 03:00:30.596]  By the way, there's a story here, because I'm getting emails all over the country, where cable systems are dropping CNN.
[03:00:32.754 --> 03:00:35.255]  Including Time Warner cable systems.
[03:00:35.255 --> 03:00:37.656]  And Pchenik was just telling me that during the break, Dr. Pchenik.
[03:00:37.656 --> 03:00:38.297]  I didn't know that.
[03:00:38.297 --> 03:00:44.020]  But we're getting these emails, I mean, that I guess in his area of the country it happened too.
[03:00:44.020 --> 03:00:46.381]  Two years ago I said CNN is dead.
[03:00:46.381 --> 03:00:48.042]  Almost two years ago, last January.
[03:00:48.042 --> 03:00:50.403]  It'll be two years this January.
[03:00:50.403 --> 03:00:52.004]  And that just shows how they're collapsing.
[03:00:52.004 --> 03:00:54.645]  Dish Network just dropped them.
[03:00:54.645 --> 03:00:56.266]  Doc, what does that signify?
[03:00:56.266 --> 03:00:58.807]  So you're saying you have Time Warner cable and CNN's not on it?
[03:00:59.599 --> 03:01:14.462]  No, actually you were very prophetic, because when you said it last week, I was about to add, well, our Windstream company, which is basically providing us with CNN and other cable, literally dropped CNN.
[03:01:14.462 --> 03:01:19.043]  And without any excuse, without any apologies, what it says is it doesn't have an audience.
[03:01:19.043 --> 03:01:22.023]  It never will have the kind of audience that you have.
[03:01:22.023 --> 03:01:24.884]  It doesn't manage to go into the millions.
[03:01:24.884 --> 03:01:26.304]  It really is just tablum.
[03:01:26.824 --> 03:01:29.146]  It's a repetition of people not watching TV.
[03:01:29.146 --> 03:01:30.587]  And by the way, you know what we're getting?
[03:01:30.587 --> 03:01:35.612]  I haven't launched it yet because I've been so busy with the satellites and a few other things, but it's going to happen soon, in the next few months.
[03:01:35.612 --> 03:01:42.338]  We have cable systems and broadcast TV beating down our doors wanting to carry the nightly news and this show.
[03:01:42.338 --> 03:01:44.560]  So it just shows it's word of mouth.
[03:01:45.486 --> 03:01:48.007]  It's exactly word of mouth, and that's the point, Alex.
[03:01:48.007 --> 03:01:53.668]  You didn't even realize how prophetic you were and how enduring you were, but CNN is not prophetic and enduring.
[03:01:53.668 --> 03:01:58.209]  I mean, Anderson Cooper did his internship at the CIA.
[03:01:58.209 --> 03:01:59.309]  He came out of jail.
[03:01:59.309 --> 03:02:03.550]  I mean, the man can't even speak the truth, and it's not effective.
[03:02:03.550 --> 03:02:04.730]  People are bored by it.
[03:02:04.730 --> 03:02:07.271]  They're bored by Fox as well, I have to tell you.
[03:02:07.271 --> 03:02:08.291]  I know Roger Ailes.
[03:02:08.291 --> 03:02:10.972]  I respect him very much, but it's nothing more than show business.
[03:02:11.866 --> 03:02:14.128]  Turn, you have literally gone forth.
[03:02:14.128 --> 03:02:15.390]  You took the risk.
[03:02:15.390 --> 03:02:16.451]  People want to learn.
[03:02:16.451 --> 03:02:18.072]  They want to hear different points of view.
[03:02:18.072 --> 03:02:22.397]  And they're really not interested in what cable has to say or TV has to say.
[03:02:22.397 --> 03:02:23.318]  And you saw it.
[03:02:23.318 --> 03:02:24.399]  The market worked.
[03:02:24.399 --> 03:02:27.081]  That Turner Broadcasting just dropped them.
[03:02:27.081 --> 03:02:28.102]  So did Winstream.
[03:02:28.102 --> 03:02:31.586]  And now you see that there is no more CNN and they won't come back on.
[03:02:32.296 --> 03:02:34.517]  And eventually nobody will care.
[03:02:34.517 --> 03:02:36.258]  And that's really what the reality was.
[03:02:36.258 --> 03:02:37.879]  But you were more prophetic than you realize.
[03:02:37.879 --> 03:02:38.839]  Well forget about me.
[03:02:38.839 --> 03:02:42.821]  I mean it was obvious when I was there two years ago they were rotting and I said they're collapsing.
[03:02:42.821 --> 03:02:45.622]  And I've been saying the last few months look at their ratings.
[03:02:45.622 --> 03:02:49.304]  I mean 15 minutes of this radio show rated.
[03:02:49.844 --> 03:02:53.325]  with Arbitron has the ratings of one of their shows.
[03:02:53.325 --> 03:02:55.245]  And I'm a small operation.
[03:02:55.245 --> 03:02:58.226]  How can I have more viewers and listeners than CNN?
[03:02:58.226 --> 03:03:00.307]  And how can they still be on TV?
[03:03:00.307 --> 03:03:03.488]  It's like this facade that was just still standing there.
[03:03:03.488 --> 03:03:05.708]  Same thing with MSNBC.
[03:03:05.708 --> 03:03:08.409]  How fast could the facade start collapsing, Dr. Pachinik?
[03:03:09.107 --> 03:03:10.507]  Well, it's collapsing now.
[03:03:10.507 --> 03:03:12.608]  Nobody's really watching MSNBC.
[03:03:12.608 --> 03:03:14.249]  Jeb Zucker is not effective.
[03:03:14.249 --> 03:03:18.750]  He wasn't effective at NBC, the man who ran that, and he's not effective at MSNBC.
[03:03:18.750 --> 03:03:25.092]  Nobody wants to hear the repetition of the same story line, same narrative, and they don't want to pay that kind of money for it.
[03:03:25.092 --> 03:03:27.653]  You, in turn, provide more punch for the dollar.
[03:03:27.653 --> 03:03:36.055]  I'm not here to advertise you, but the point of fact is, you can do it for well over 12 to 13 years, where CNN cannot do it.
[03:03:36.055 --> 03:03:37.396]  Well, I mean, that's just since...
[03:03:38.672 --> 03:03:39.433]  For 13 years.
[03:03:39.433 --> 03:03:40.034]  We've been talking.
[03:03:40.034 --> 03:03:41.656]  I've been on air 20, but I was a lot smaller.
[03:03:41.656 --> 03:03:42.757]  20 years, right.
[03:03:42.757 --> 03:03:43.839]  Yeah, but you grew.
[03:03:43.839 --> 03:03:44.960]  They did not grow.
[03:03:44.960 --> 03:03:49.406]  They went from a lot of money to very ineffectual, deleveraging positions.
[03:03:49.406 --> 03:03:53.070]  Remember when Time Warner AOL was the biggest company in the world?
[03:03:56.109 --> 03:03:58.270]  Yeah, but it was an unholy alliance.
[03:03:58.270 --> 03:04:03.834]  You had Time Warner, which I was part of as a book writer, and they had money, and AOL was the paper company.
[03:04:03.834 --> 03:04:05.755]  We had nothing more than paper.
[03:04:05.755 --> 03:04:08.997]  And basically, AOL now is really not very effective.
[03:04:08.997 --> 03:04:10.197]  It doesn't grow.
[03:04:10.197 --> 03:04:12.459]  And most of the institutions are too large.
[03:04:12.459 --> 03:04:13.639]  They can't provide.
[03:04:13.639 --> 03:04:15.600]  They can't adapt.
[03:04:16.641 --> 03:04:17.782]  Well, listen, I agree with you.
[03:04:17.782 --> 03:04:21.044]  The establishment is a joke if people will just stand up to it.
[03:04:21.044 --> 03:04:22.105]  And you're an example of that.
[03:04:22.105 --> 03:04:22.925]  I'm an example.
[03:04:22.925 --> 03:04:23.626]  Our listeners are.
[03:04:23.626 --> 03:04:24.606]  I'm sorry to all the callers.
[03:04:24.606 --> 03:04:25.567]  I'm out of time.
[03:04:25.567 --> 03:04:27.528]  Dr. Pachinik, thank you so much for the time today.
[03:04:27.528 --> 03:04:30.310]  Interesting perspective on the whole world.
[03:04:30.310 --> 03:04:31.271]  Always a pleasure.
[03:04:31.271 --> 03:04:31.511]  All right.
[03:04:31.511 --> 03:04:32.051]  Thank you so much.
[03:04:32.051 --> 03:04:33.192]  Thank your audience.
[03:04:33.192 --> 03:04:33.492]  All right.
[03:04:33.492 --> 03:04:36.114]  StevePachinik.com is his website.
[03:04:36.114 --> 03:04:39.476]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are our websites.
[03:04:39.476 --> 03:04:41.658]  And I'm not trying to be the biggest thing around.
[03:04:41.658 --> 03:04:45.700]  In fact, it's daunting and a little bit creepy to have as much responsibility.
[03:04:46.922 --> 03:04:49.005]  The dinosaurs are dropping.
[03:04:49.005 --> 03:04:49.867]  They're already dead.
[03:04:49.867 --> 03:04:52.751]  They're just putting perfume on them so you don't smell the stink.
[03:04:52.751 --> 03:04:53.613]  Great job with the crew.
[03:04:53.613 --> 03:04:55.216]  Back tonight, 7 o'clock central.
[03:04:55.216 --> 03:04:56.277]  InfoWars Nightly News.
