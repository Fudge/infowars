[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:43.880]  Texas Alex Jones we are live my friends thank you so much for joining us it is
[00:43.880 --> 00:53.760]  Tuesday the 22nd day of March 2011 and we have former top CIA briefer to Ronald
[00:53.760 --> 00:58.440]  Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush Ray McGovern to give us his take on Libya
[00:58.440 --> 01:02.680]  and what's unfolding in the Middle East he'll be joining us coming up in the
[01:02.680 --> 01:06.040]  third hour today Webster Griffin Tarpley is going to pop in for just one
[01:06.040 --> 01:11.040]  segment either at the bottom of this hour or at the start of the next hour we've
[01:11.040 --> 01:14.520]  confirmed he's on we just don't know what time yet and we're working that out
[01:14.520 --> 01:19.880]  right now it has been confirmed and Tarpley mentioned this yesterday but
[01:19.880 --> 01:27.320]  now it's in US news and Russian news Libyan assault planned months ahead well
[01:27.320 --> 01:32.240]  of course it was planned months ahead it was globalist back special forces from
[01:32.240 --> 01:36.600]  the US and England now you've seen that US aircraft probably shot down they claim
[01:36.600 --> 01:42.120]  it crashed because of technical problems mechanical difficulties right outside
[01:42.120 --> 01:48.920]  of Benghazi that yes US aircraft are in their bombs away and so are US special
[01:48.920 --> 01:55.560]  forces they've got amphibious invasion ships off the coast and that is in the
[01:55.560 --> 02:01.320]  cards but Libyan assault planned months ahead General Wesley Clark proof Libyan
[02:01.320 --> 02:05.800]  invasion was planned ten years in advance US General Wesley Clark explains
[02:05.800 --> 02:10.120]  that the Bush administration plan to take out seven countries in five years
[02:10.120 --> 02:17.640]  Iraq Syria Lebanon Libya Somalia Sudan and Iran and if there's protest in Iran
[02:17.640 --> 02:22.400]  and the government crushes them or if there's military attacks by US backed or
[02:22.400 --> 02:28.080]  globalist back rebels in Iran will we then be forced to invade Iran that's the
[02:28.080 --> 02:32.800]  precedent being set right now and it's now become a big debate we started
[02:32.800 --> 02:36.880]  covering this last Friday now it's finally in mainstream news that the
[02:36.880 --> 02:40.360]  Congress had nothing to say about this Congress didn't even have a resolution
[02:40.360 --> 02:48.480]  much less a declaration of war and that Obama has taken direct orders from the
[02:48.480 --> 02:57.360]  UN which sets an incredible which sets an incredible precedent so we're gonna
[02:57.360 --> 03:02.960]  be going over all the facets of that today Tarpley called us this morning and
[03:02.960 --> 03:06.880]  with baited breath saying it's the proof it's the proof and here it is out of the
[03:06.880 --> 03:11.920]  Asian Tribune it's also in the London Guardian Libyan rebellion has radical
[03:11.920 --> 03:17.520]  Islamist fervor Benghazi linked to Islamic militancy US military document
[03:17.520 --> 03:22.080]  reveals that they're funding Al Qaeda well that was in London Telegraph Sunday
[03:22.080 --> 03:26.680]  we wrote about it on Sunday before that article even came out in fact I know it
[03:26.680 --> 03:33.120]  was in yesterday's stack will you just repull me the London Telegraph article
[03:33.120 --> 03:37.480]  dealing with it being Al Qaeda you see you can't get around the fact it was Al
[03:37.480 --> 03:43.680]  Qaeda attacked Russia under US orders you can't get around the fact that it was
[03:43.680 --> 03:47.680]  Al Qaeda attacked the Serbs and then oh we had to bomb them through the UN and
[03:47.680 --> 03:52.080]  NATO because how dare the Serbs fight back you can't get around the fact but
[03:52.080 --> 03:55.960]  it's so crazy and I admit it sounds crazy truth is stranger than fiction
[03:55.960 --> 04:01.160]  who do you think Al Qaeda is it's a Saudi Arabian terror group created by the CIA
[04:01.160 --> 04:06.880]  and the Saudis that they use to attack the US and then they invade Al Qaeda's
[04:06.880 --> 04:13.320]  ancient enemy Iraq Saudi Arabia's big enemy I mean have you figured this out
[04:13.320 --> 04:17.920]  yet I mean look at the facts ladies and gentlemen remember we'll pull up Fox News
[04:17.920 --> 04:21.760]  and show your AP Amaral Milwaukee number one in Al Qaeda now at the time number
[04:21.760 --> 04:27.760]  three meeting secretly at the Pentagon I mean this is the incredible reality that
[04:27.760 --> 04:31.840]  we're dealing with here now I also want to open the phones up throughout the
[04:31.840 --> 04:35.640]  broadcast today but I want to just hear your comment your question I got to move
[04:35.640 --> 04:38.640]  the next person because if it's long-winded and I'm long-winded we
[04:38.640 --> 04:48.000]  won't get to anybody 1-800-259-9231-8259-9231 is the toll-free number to
[04:48.000 --> 04:52.240]  join us but you're partly coming up in about 25 minutes from now we've got
[04:52.240 --> 04:55.200]  Ray McGovern and a lot more in the latest on the reactors it ain't looking
[04:55.200 --> 05:00.960]  good and radiation maps what's hitting the United States stay with us
[05:00.960 --> 05:05.760]  Alex has told you that the mid-east uprisings over food prices and shortages
[05:05.760 --> 05:09.800]  caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide we're seeing the impact right
[05:09.800 --> 05:13.800]  here in the United States ethanol that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and
[05:13.800 --> 05:18.480]  fuel prices hit a 30-month high in February and pump prices are expected
[05:18.480 --> 05:23.240]  to reach $5 a gallon because of shipping costs food is being priced out of the
[05:23.240 --> 05:28.040]  reach of millions of Americans with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days

[08:05.520 --> 08:13.560]  the information war continues it's alex jones and the GCN radio network
[08:16.320 --> 08:24.760]  it is Tuesday the 22nd day of March 2011 Webster Griffin Tarbley with huge new
[08:24.760 --> 08:28.400]  developments is joining us at the bottom of the hour then Ray McGovern
[08:28.400 --> 08:32.560]  former top CIA analyst Ronald Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush will be
[08:32.560 --> 08:39.040]  joining us in the third hour today there's been huge new developments in
[08:39.040 --> 08:43.360]  Japan they are obviously now and even mainstream media is having to admit this
[08:43.360 --> 08:50.480]  covering up the full magnitude the Pentagon is considering forced evacuations
[08:50.480 --> 09:00.120]  of US personnel in Japan we also have a special guest of the Corbett report
[09:00.120 --> 09:05.480]  he's been out of out of Japan during the disaster but he's gonna be back in
[09:05.480 --> 09:10.280]  Japan he's actually back there now we'll be interviewing him tomorrow but here's
[09:10.280 --> 09:19.320]  some of the news xenon-133 animation is up on info wars.com showing the
[09:19.320 --> 09:28.200]  dispersion of the radioactive isotope the radiation has blanketed the entire
[09:28.200 --> 09:37.720]  United States xenon-133 and it has a 5,243 day half-life has now reached the
[09:37.720 --> 09:43.080]  entire eastern seaboard and will soon likely cover the entire world zero hedge
[09:43.080 --> 09:48.600]  has that breakdown of the maps and when I get into this we'll put it up on screen
[09:48.600 --> 09:54.360]  for president planet TV viewers also nuclear plant contaminate see after
[09:54.360 --> 09:59.280]  damaged the fuel rods not just the spent fuel rods the hundreds of thousands
[09:59.280 --> 10:02.160]  of them blown in all directions and thousands of feet in the air but the
[10:02.160 --> 10:08.320]  live uranium and plutonium fuel rods inside the reactors that's Bloomberg
[10:08.320 --> 10:14.240]  also a key report at prisonplanet.com by Steve Watson Fukushima radiation level
[10:14.240 --> 10:18.720]  cover-up readings around plant do not correlate with those observed 100
[10:18.720 --> 10:22.440]  kilometers away they're finally giving us readings from in and around the plant
[10:22.440 --> 10:29.880]  over a week later CNN report US military considers mandatory evacuations in
[10:29.880 --> 10:33.560]  Japan the US military is considering the mandatory evacuation of thousands of
[10:33.560 --> 10:36.680]  American troops and their families in Japan out of concern over rising
[10:36.680 --> 10:41.440]  radiation levels a senior defense official tells CNN but you notice this
[10:41.440 --> 10:45.320]  this is basically out of the news it's still there but not on the front burner
[10:45.320 --> 10:50.080]  now and we got reports last Friday that the first radiation from the Friday
[10:50.080 --> 10:54.880]  before it reached and since then there's all these different private radiation
[10:54.880 --> 11:00.040]  monitoring maps online and you'll see increased levels and then hours later it
[11:00.040 --> 11:06.400]  gets taken down and they say it was a mistake and with the past history of the
[11:06.400 --> 11:09.080]  federal government going into universities and other facilities and
[11:09.080 --> 11:13.960]  telling them to basically whitewash things at Three Mile Island what the
[11:13.960 --> 11:18.680]  Russians did in Ukraine outside Kiev with your noble what the Japanese have been
[11:18.680 --> 11:22.120]  caught doing you really can't believe a word you're being told to remember as the
[11:22.120 --> 11:26.560]  nuclear physicists have explained when you sit there with a Geiger counter and
[11:26.560 --> 11:29.800]  it only shows slight increases that's because you're measuring the general
[11:29.800 --> 11:36.120]  background increase but in fallout it's only that little piece that's actually
[11:36.120 --> 11:40.160]  highly radioactive with uranium or plutonium or some of the other deadly
[11:40.160 --> 11:44.760]  isotopes that if you breathe it or that if it touches the end of the Geiger
[11:44.760 --> 11:48.560]  counter then you get a spike then the dust falls off the front you go well
[11:48.560 --> 11:52.440]  why did that just jump and now it jumped for 10 minutes and now it has you know
[11:52.440 --> 11:55.720]  it was 20 something times 30 something times now it's now the Geiger counter
[11:55.720 --> 12:00.280]  stopped because it's that invisible little pieces of dust floating around I
[12:00.280 --> 12:07.160]  mean they say the background radiation and a radiation in a uranium mine isn't
[12:07.160 --> 12:12.800]  even readable as an increase on a Geiger counter that have special devices to
[12:12.800 --> 12:17.040]  even pick up where it's at but you breathe that stuff mining in there for a
[12:17.040 --> 12:22.000]  decade you get lung cancer and it's the same situation that this is not good
[12:22.000 --> 12:26.160]  for us but the nuclear industry tied in with the government joined at the hip is
[12:26.160 --> 12:30.240]  very powerful and they've got a long history not just here but in every other
[12:30.240 --> 12:37.200]  nuclear power of covering this situation up so continuing it's not a good sign
[12:37.200 --> 12:41.960]  that the military is considering a mandatory evacuation after five days
[12:41.960 --> 12:49.280]  ago having a voluntary evacuation and they found upwards of 26 times safe
[12:49.280 --> 12:54.800]  levels of radiation in the Japanese water and the Japanese food as far away
[12:54.800 --> 13:00.200]  as a hundred plus miles from Fukushima and remember we have up in Canada a
[13:00.200 --> 13:05.480]  reactor last week that released a bunch of radioactive isotopes into the lake
[13:05.480 --> 13:11.640]  and then it was just a minor footnote they said oh it's safe levels so it's
[13:11.640 --> 13:15.760]  standard operating procedure Reuters reports steam rises from stricken
[13:15.760 --> 13:22.080]  Japan plant they're just continuing to melt continuing to have fires and Steve
[13:22.080 --> 13:27.240]  Watson's article has aircraft photos heat photos taken and released by the US
[13:27.240 --> 13:32.440]  government showing just incredible heat signatures inside of those plants
[13:32.440 --> 13:37.160]  they're in some stage of meltdown that's been admitted going back seven days
[13:37.160 --> 13:43.400]  ago they were admitting actually eight days ago they were admitting last
[13:43.400 --> 13:48.320]  Monday partial meltdowns and those explosions and partial breaches of the
[13:48.320 --> 13:52.120]  containment facilities so the truth is government is covering this up that's
[13:52.120 --> 13:57.960]  a hundred percent we just don't know the severity of the cover-up that's going
[13:57.960 --> 14:02.440]  on right now but smoke and steam rose from two of the most threatening actors
[14:02.440 --> 14:07.800]  at Japan's quake crippled nuke plant on Tuesday suggesting the battle to avert a
[14:07.800 --> 14:12.600]  disastrous meltdown and stop the spread of radiation was far from one there's
[14:12.600 --> 14:16.160]  already been partial meltdowns confirmed they admit that there's already been
[14:16.160 --> 14:21.760]  600,000 plus fuel rods catching on fire exploding stored on top of four reactors
[14:21.760 --> 14:26.080]  that have blown sky high they claim that there's only partial breaches on two of
[14:26.080 --> 14:31.240]  the internal containment facilities but outside of it was stored and on the roof
[14:31.240 --> 14:37.600]  was stored the hundreds of thousands of rods so amazing information on that
[14:37.600 --> 14:46.920]  front continuing with this information if they have complete meltdowns and it
[14:46.920 --> 14:49.960]  may have already happened because the winds are going straight out to see it's
[14:49.960 --> 14:53.520]  easy for them to try to cover it up with the increased radiation levels in and
[14:53.520 --> 14:57.960]  around Japan and just whitewash that if they have complete Chernobyl type melt
[14:57.960 --> 15:01.600]  downs or if that's happened and we haven't been told remember last Friday
[15:01.600 --> 15:06.040]  the head of the plant breaks down and cries and says I can't cover up this is
[15:06.040 --> 15:11.280]  a this is enough radiation to kill people I can't lie to you the Fukushima 50
[15:11.280 --> 15:16.720]  the people that are working in there valiantly are probably gonna die what
[15:16.720 --> 15:20.840]  does that tell you about what's being blown out to see but the globalist it
[15:20.840 --> 15:24.640]  with DU they tell the troops to use they know it's a death sentence and their
[15:24.640 --> 15:30.360]  own army manuals on it that was army regulations to issue those to all the
[15:30.360 --> 15:34.880]  troops up until 1991 they just stopped issuing them we've had dr. Doug Rocky
[15:34.880 --> 15:43.240]  wrote the manuals on physicist the leading NBC trainer most of police out
[15:43.240 --> 15:47.080]  there today were trained by people trained by Rocky and they lie to you and
[15:47.080 --> 15:51.200]  say that's no problem until 91 it was deadly poisonous highly radioactive
[15:51.200 --> 15:56.200]  couldn't use it unless it was a world war 3 scenario with giant divisions of
[15:56.200 --> 16:00.440]  Russian tanks pouring across outnumbering NATO forces 10 to 1 it was a
[16:00.440 --> 16:05.720]  last-ditch weapon just like Davy Crockett tactical nukes were but the
[16:05.720 --> 16:09.120]  globalist said you know what let him go ahead and use it serve it out to m16s
[16:09.120 --> 16:16.040]  serve it out to NATO 308 serve it out to all the major fighting vehicles
[16:16.040 --> 16:20.840]  calibers the guns and the Bradleys the guns and the warrior vehicles the big
[16:20.840 --> 16:28.520]  Shabo D rounds in the Abrams the Abrams m1 what is it m1a1 now that's a
[16:28.520 --> 16:35.440]  rifle I forget the newest type of Abrams the point is they serve these systems
[16:35.440 --> 16:40.880]  out and then they use it all over the place and they know exactly what they're
[16:40.880 --> 16:43.760]  doing so if they'll tell the troops use something that they know is going to
[16:43.760 --> 16:49.240]  soft kill them what will they do to us and that's the issue is these different
[16:49.240 --> 16:56.320]  types of radioactive fallout begin to hit the US we'll put the zero hedge but I
[16:56.320 --> 16:59.680]  found to be a very good source of information we also have what Watson
[16:59.680 --> 17:03.120]  writing another article on this right now we'll put this up on screen xenon
[17:03.120 --> 17:12.560]  1 3 3 dispersion radio nuclei has blanketed entire United States radioactive
[17:12.560 --> 17:25.640]  xenon 1 3 3 as a 5,243 day half-life or is that a 5.243 day half-life I I've got
[17:25.640 --> 17:30.560]  to research this more has now reached the guys look up with xenon 1 3 3 is
[17:30.560 --> 17:35.360]  half-life fish has now reached the entire eastern seaboard and soon will
[17:35.360 --> 17:41.000]  likely cover the entire world we know Chernobyl did and we'll continue with
[17:41.000 --> 17:44.960]  that report let's show them the animation let's scroll down and roll
[17:44.960 --> 17:51.680]  that animation for prison planet dot TV viewers there it is there's the
[17:51.680 --> 17:57.560]  animation up above it and it's showing it being dispersed from Japan and then
[17:57.560 --> 18:10.680]  coming in as a cloud and drifting across into the United States and that's the

[24:21.000 --> 24:26.960]  Webster Tarpley coming up with powerful new information let me start segueing
[24:26.960 --> 24:31.880]  into this key info right now I covered the Fox News article for those of you
[24:31.880 --> 24:36.280]  living out there in denial Associated Press and others also reported on this
[24:36.280 --> 24:41.760]  last October and November and we're all lucky who they now have said is the
[24:41.760 --> 24:47.640]  number one in Al Qaeda he has replaced Osama bin Laden as the boogeyman puppet
[24:47.640 --> 24:53.080]  trained in the u.s. lived in the u.s. he's behind the underwear bomber he's
[24:53.080 --> 25:00.440]  behind the Times Square bomber the shoe bomber the Fort Hood shooter he's the
[25:00.440 --> 25:06.000]  name they use via email and phone calls when they contact useful idiot mentally
[25:06.000 --> 25:13.520]  ill real terrorist in the u.s. who they try to get to attack targets and who did
[25:13.520 --> 25:16.680]  they use to attack the Serbs then NATO went in and blew the daylight side of
[25:16.680 --> 25:21.520]  them Al Qaeda out of Albania on record that's not debated who do they use to
[25:21.520 --> 25:25.840]  attack Iran White House admitted four years ago Al Qaeda number three in Al
[25:25.840 --> 25:35.120]  Qaeda who do they use to go after Qaddafi Al Qaeda that's headline here out of the
[25:35.120 --> 25:43.600]  London Telegraph now that said here is the London Telegraph the West and Al
[25:43.600 --> 25:48.560]  Qaeda are on the same side statements of support for Libya's revolution by Al
[25:48.560 --> 25:53.080]  Qaeda and leading Islamists have led to fears that military action by the West
[25:53.080 --> 25:57.200]  might be playing into the hands of its ideological enemies this is not the West
[25:57.200 --> 26:02.520]  ideological enemies it's the bankers crew of terrorist who come and menace the
[26:02.520 --> 26:06.560]  West so we'll be held ransom by the globalists that own the military
[26:06.560 --> 26:12.280]  industrial complex to pay trillions a year into the black hole and so they
[26:12.280 --> 26:16.720]  can use them to menace the West to give up our liberties and our freedoms and so
[26:16.720 --> 26:22.680]  they can set up their police state control grid and here of course is the
[26:22.680 --> 26:30.160]  latest report dealing with this out of the Asian Tribune Libyan revolution has
[26:30.160 --> 26:35.800]  radical Islamist fervor Benghazi linked to Islamic militancy US military
[26:35.800 --> 26:41.280]  document reveals well known to the United States policymakers in Obama's
[26:41.280 --> 26:43.840]  White House and Clinton State Department along with the National
[26:43.840 --> 26:48.200]  Security Council but not widely known the American mainstream media the US
[26:48.200 --> 26:53.080]  West Point Military Academy's combating terrorism center document reveals that
[26:53.080 --> 26:57.960]  Libya sent more fighters to Iraq's Islamic militancy on a per capita basis
[26:57.960 --> 27:02.160]  than any other Muslim country including Saudi Arabia perhaps more alarmingly for
[27:02.160 --> 27:06.360]  Western policymakers most of the fighters came from Eastern Libya the
[27:06.360 --> 27:12.360]  center of the current uprising against Muammar Gaddafi the analysis of the
[27:12.360 --> 27:16.440]  combating terrorism center West Point was based on the records captured by
[27:16.440 --> 27:21.920]  coalition forces in October of 07 in a raid near Sinjar along Iraq's Syrian
[27:21.920 --> 27:26.160]  border and it basically goes into the fact that Saudi Arabia is involved the
[27:26.160 --> 27:31.120]  US is involved the point is they hide this stuff in plain view that's who the
[27:31.120 --> 27:38.000]  airstrikes are backing is real Al Qaeda and it's on record that they're shipping
[27:38.000 --> 27:45.680]  arms in out of Saudi Arabia fighters in out of Saudi Arabia through Western
[27:45.680 --> 27:54.600]  Egypt into Eastern Libya that's who's there I mean on every front in Serbia in
[27:54.600 --> 28:01.560]  Iran in the United States and we're all a lucky the 7-7 bombers it turned out was
[28:01.560 --> 28:05.960]  run by the admitted head of Al Qaeda in England who the British were supporting
[28:05.960 --> 28:10.440]  and protecting and who's an MI6 asset that's in my film Terror Storm made made
[28:10.440 --> 28:19.480]  four and a half five years ago 2007 release 2007 I mean may British SAS
[28:19.480 --> 28:25.800]  caught dressed up as Sunnis running around in Basra shooting Iraqi police on
[28:25.800 --> 28:31.240]  record to get the Sunnis and Shiites killing each other this is the strategy
[28:31.240 --> 28:36.240]  it's so simple the globalist hate America they're dismantling the republic
[28:36.240 --> 28:41.120]  this isn't the US government our flag our country our money has been captured
[28:41.120 --> 28:44.720]  by the offshore globalist the same ones destroying our liberties and our freedoms
[28:44.720 --> 28:48.640]  launching these wars ordering torture using Hollywood they control the
[28:48.640 --> 28:55.080]  tell us tortures good to destroy our name worldwide to set us up later now all
[28:55.080 --> 28:59.000]  of that said it's turned out US and British special forces have been there
[28:59.000 --> 29:04.720]  since before the fall of many areas of Libya it turns out alberida in the UN
[29:04.720 --> 29:11.400]  globalist back we're in there bringing down Mubarak months ago and now we learn
[29:11.400 --> 29:15.680]  it's not just US and British special forces Libya US fighter jet crash lands
[29:15.680 --> 29:23.520]  in field near Benghazi an F-15 an F-15 a bomber fighter bomber in their
[29:23.520 --> 29:25.880]  dropping bombs you weren't told that in the news you were told it was only
[29:25.880 --> 29:31.320]  cruise missiles our intel was they were launching aircraft bombers off those
[29:31.320 --> 29:40.920]  ships and they are attacking african now confirms that that's going on it is
[29:40.920 --> 29:46.280]  confirmed and we're gonna come back and talk a little extra partly about this
[29:46.280 --> 29:50.880]  think about it al-qaeda works for the globalist against everybody we're on

[30:00.600 --> 30:03.960]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[30:03.960 --> 30:07.920]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[30:07.920 --> 30:12.200]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[30:12.200 --> 30:16.480]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[30:16.480 --> 30:20.840]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[30:20.840 --> 30:24.920]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[30:24.920 --> 30:29.480]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[30:29.480 --> 30:33.600]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[30:33.600 --> 30:37.560]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[30:37.560 --> 30:41.360]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[30:41.360 --> 30:44.080]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[32:36.960 --> 32:40.480]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[32:40.480 --> 32:45.720]  checkout to. Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we

[35:49.280 --> 35:54.480]  by West Point right by the top war strategist there that dovetails with the
[35:54.480 --> 35:59.360]  Asia times Libyan rebellion has radical Islamist's fervor Benghazi link to
[35:59.360 --> 36:03.760]  Islamic militancy US military documents reveal but let's continue here's the
[36:03.760 --> 36:08.960]  London Telegraph the West and Al Qaeda are on the same side Al Qaeda being
[36:08.960 --> 36:14.680]  funded by the West Wesley Clark we have this clip later saying what you said
[36:14.680 --> 36:18.000]  yesterday we now have the video clip saying that there with that this is a
[36:18.000 --> 36:22.240]  ten-year-old plan to invade all these countries and to use Al Qaeda to
[36:22.240 --> 36:27.360]  basically destabilize it explain to people how Brazinski created it what it
[36:27.360 --> 36:32.360]  is how these rogue networks operate and how big this is that here we're being
[36:32.360 --> 36:36.360]  told that there are these heroes Al Qaeda that we've got to protect from
[36:36.360 --> 36:40.080]  Gaddafi they call them protesters when they're not protesters they have their
[36:40.080 --> 36:43.920]  own fighter jets that have crashed they have their own tanks their own missile
[36:43.920 --> 36:48.080]  launchers and Gaddafi has said I'm not saying he's an angel folks the point is
[36:48.080 --> 36:52.480]  he's a lesser of two evils he said to Obama yesterday what would you do if
[36:52.480 --> 36:57.600]  rebels were launching missile attacks on cities but the but our media calls them
[36:57.600 --> 37:04.800]  democratic protesters now Al Qaeda is our is the good guys well the history of
[37:04.800 --> 37:09.560]  it of course is that the Al Qaeda was created by the United States by the CIA
[37:09.560 --> 37:14.120]  by Robert Gates actually who was working for Brzezinski in the Carter
[37:14.120 --> 37:20.080]  administration and then under Reagan as a secret army Al Qaeda is a CIA secret
[37:20.080 --> 37:24.520]  army to be used against the Soviets in Afghanistan and among the personnel that
[37:24.520 --> 37:28.840]  we've got added on later on a younger and more energetic guy would be this
[37:28.840 --> 37:34.080]  double agent Al Laki the CIA Laki who's been used to cheap dip all kinds of
[37:34.080 --> 37:38.920]  people from Major Hassan to to the guy with the Times Square bomb and so forth
[37:38.920 --> 37:44.920]  however the the headline right now is the United Nations resolution and the
[37:44.920 --> 37:49.480]  entire NATO coalition and other countries too are now bombing Libya in
[37:49.480 --> 37:54.040]  defensive civilians a humanitarian intervention in defensive civilians who
[37:54.040 --> 37:57.720]  are these civilians of course they're armed gangs they're they're a group of
[37:57.720 --> 38:03.320]  irregular military forces by the way are rounding up random people robbing
[38:03.320 --> 38:07.840]  people mainstream news confirms that lining them up and shooting them they're
[38:07.840 --> 38:11.880]  lynching black Africans they are highly racist they think every any black black
[38:11.880 --> 38:14.880]  person is if it's a mercenary for Gaddafi but the big headline is this
[38:14.880 --> 38:20.680]  northeast Libya the hotbed of the rebellion Benghazi Tobruk and Darna
[38:20.680 --> 38:27.560]  is terrorist heaven it's al-Qaeda's number one world recurrent ground so the
[38:27.560 --> 38:34.200]  people that you are defending US troops are being risked today to defend the
[38:34.200 --> 38:40.200]  existence of the younger brothers of the suicide bombers who blew up American
[38:40.200 --> 38:45.960]  soldiers and others in Iraq let's just look at this study I would recommend
[38:45.960 --> 38:51.000]  people take a look at it it comes from the combating terrorist center of the
[38:51.000 --> 38:55.000]  Department of Political Sciences United States Military Academy West Point
[38:55.000 --> 39:00.680]  December 2007 and what we find in here is that the number one country for
[39:00.680 --> 39:06.800]  recruiting suicide bombers and other terrorist fighters to go into Iraq and
[39:06.800 --> 39:12.640]  kill GIs is Libya and the statistics of the following Libya is a country with
[39:12.640 --> 39:19.720]  six million people it nevertheless supplied 20% of the al-Qaeda terrorists
[39:19.720 --> 39:25.320]  in Iraq and this comes from the essentially the US captured the al-Qaeda
[39:25.320 --> 39:30.640]  personnel file in a city called Sinjar near the Syrian border in October
[39:30.640 --> 39:36.200]  of 2007 so one arm of the of of the military captured the CIA's dossier of
[39:36.200 --> 39:40.320]  the eastern recruiting ground that wasn't even really under the control of
[39:40.320 --> 39:46.960]  Qaddafi six million people six and a half now produce 20% of the terrorists in
[39:46.960 --> 39:54.760]  Iraq now Saudi Arabia with 25 million people produced about 40% so you get
[39:54.760 --> 39:59.880]  an idea that the the Libyan contribution to the al-Qaeda terrorist
[39:59.880 --> 40:07.040]  patsy fanatic psychotic presence in Iraq is much greater than the population
[40:07.040 --> 40:10.840]  and now that they even break it down according to cities the number one
[40:10.840 --> 40:14.920]  source of terrorist fighters going into Iraq according to these al-Qaeda
[40:14.920 --> 40:21.440]  personnel files was Saudi Arabia was Riyadh so the city of Riyadh with 4.3
[40:21.440 --> 40:28.480]  million people contributed 52 terrorists second place goes to the city of
[40:28.480 --> 40:37.200]  Darna in Libya with 51 terrorists but Darna only has 80,000 people so Riyadh
[40:37.200 --> 40:44.680]  52 terrorists 4.3 million people Darna 51 terrorists 80,000 it means that Darna
[40:44.680 --> 40:48.040]  which is right there by the Egyptian border it's a part of the area being
[40:48.040 --> 40:52.840]  defended by the no-fly zone this is terrorist heaven this is the number one
[40:52.840 --> 40:57.200]  terrorist the recruiting center in the world in proportion to population you
[40:57.200 --> 41:02.080]  go down the list mecca comes in third in Saudi Arabia with 43 that's a much
[41:02.080 --> 41:08.480]  larger city the number four is Benghazi Benghazi with 21 terrorists Benghazi is
[41:08.480 --> 41:15.360]  the capital of this rebel confederacy or coalition that the CIA has put
[41:15.360 --> 41:19.720]  together so we now have this unbelievable situation where the United
[41:19.720 --> 41:24.480]  Nations and NATO and the United States are all saying a humanitarian emergency
[41:24.480 --> 41:29.440]  we must intervene to protect the heroes of democracy from the evil dictator
[41:29.440 --> 41:34.080]  Gaddafi and it turns out that the heroes of democracy are the younger brothers
[41:34.080 --> 41:38.880]  of the suicide bombers who went into Iraq and killed American soldiers and
[41:38.880 --> 41:43.440]  other members of the international coalition as well as Iraqis and at the
[41:43.440 --> 41:48.840]  same time this is going on the US is bombing Pakistan predator drones are
[41:48.840 --> 41:54.400]  over Pakistan right now killing people in the name of fighting al-Qaeda even as
[41:54.400 --> 41:59.520]  the United States is is joining hands with al-Qaeda and defending them against
[41:59.520 --> 42:03.120]  Gaddafi let me let me stop you and then I want you to continue dr. Tarple of
[42:03.120 --> 42:06.160]  your breakdown but but but for people that don't understand full spectrum
[42:06.160 --> 42:10.200]  dominance for people that don't understand the true strategy here or the
[42:10.200 --> 42:15.320]  stratagem correct me or or I know I'm not wrong but but elaborate on what I'm
[42:15.320 --> 42:21.160]  about to say you have a giant global corporate globalist combine that's
[42:21.160 --> 42:25.520]  basically a mafia that's waging war against the nation-state whether it's
[42:25.520 --> 42:31.480]  America Libya it doesn't matter that uses slick propaganda and packaging they
[42:31.480 --> 42:35.840]  need the multi trillion dollar a year wars the multi trillion dollar a year
[42:35.840 --> 42:41.200]  US defense budget alone they've got to manufacture threats and so the average
[42:41.200 --> 42:45.960]  American sees it like oh America wants to go beat al-Qaeda and then they don't
[42:45.960 --> 42:49.320]  understand well then why is al-Qaeda always funded and working for the
[42:49.320 --> 42:55.440]  globalist because that's how they start the wars that's how they create the
[42:55.440 --> 43:01.960]  pretext they use this secret army to destabilize any area they want as the
[43:01.960 --> 43:05.120]  pretext to then invade look at a chessboard if they want to invade a
[43:05.120 --> 43:10.600]  certain country on the map they put the al-Qaeda piece into that map and then
[43:10.600 --> 43:14.680]  they can stage it themselves or their patsy's can stage it as a pretext to put
[43:14.680 --> 43:20.960]  in sanctions no fly zones invasions whatever they want that's what al-Qaeda
[43:20.960 --> 43:25.480]  is so people who look at this like well al-Qaeda doesn't work for us well there
[43:25.480 --> 43:29.480]  is no us we don't run this country anymore we're run by the globalist who
[43:29.480 --> 43:35.440]  use us as their overall global engine of a modern neocolonialism and al-Qaeda is
[43:35.440 --> 43:41.040]  this convenient boogeyman or a pretext to invade or attack or destabilize any
[43:41.040 --> 43:44.480]  country they want to go into and you can't get around that historical fact
[43:44.480 --> 43:50.040]  that they do work for the New World Order if al-Qaeda is essentially a pool of
[43:50.040 --> 43:55.520]  patsy's of fanatics of fighters of psychotics of militants who can be used
[43:55.520 --> 44:01.560]  the ideology of al-Qaeda is that all existing Arab and Islamic Muslim
[44:01.560 --> 44:06.000]  government are illegitimate none of them represents the caliphate they say
[44:06.000 --> 44:09.760]  that the caliphate is the is the form of government that that is prescribed by
[44:09.760 --> 44:13.640]  the by the holy books and therefore none of them are any good so with al-Qaeda
[44:13.640 --> 44:17.680]  you immediately have a way to attack any existing Arab government case in point
[44:17.680 --> 44:24.000]  the Libyan Islamic fighting group the Libyan Islamic fighting group their line
[44:24.000 --> 44:29.240]  is Gaddafi is an apostate Gaddafi is somebody who might once have been a
[44:29.240 --> 44:33.680]  Muslim but he's now an apostate he's a heretic he's he's gotten out of his
[44:33.680 --> 44:38.600]  religion he's turned into a into a secularist this Libyan Islamic fighting
[44:38.600 --> 44:44.720]  group has transmogrified they changed themselves into al-Qaeda of the Islamic
[44:44.720 --> 44:49.200]  Maghreb and you can look at their website al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb
[44:49.200 --> 44:54.280]  their website says down with Gaddafi down with the dictator long live the
[44:54.280 --> 45:00.480]  wonderful fighters and heroes of Benghazi Benghazi and Tobruk and Darna
[45:00.480 --> 45:05.600]  and don't forget Darna because Darna is the place that's terrorist heaven al-Qaeda
[45:05.600 --> 45:10.120]  heaven and this is this is what the US has allied with now but Webster isn't
[45:10.120 --> 45:14.640]  this this West Point report the left hand not knowing what the right hand's
[45:14.640 --> 45:19.640]  doing well you know life is complicated and it's impossible to control
[45:19.640 --> 45:23.080]  everything and when you're when you're when you're improvising these crazy
[45:23.080 --> 45:27.640]  operations from one year to the next the problem with any covert operation is
[45:27.640 --> 45:31.920]  it can't be kept secret over time because you've got to redeploy the assets
[45:31.920 --> 45:35.880]  in other words this the West Point report says right now in Iraq this is
[45:35.880 --> 45:39.920]  giving us a hard time right because the Bush Cheney line was the presence of
[45:39.920 --> 45:44.480]  al-Qaeda is used to justify a US military attack right that would be
[45:44.480 --> 45:50.640]  Zarkawi and the al-Qaeda in Iraq but now under Obama you're not you're not
[45:50.640 --> 45:56.160]  using al-Qaeda as a way to to attack it because it's there you're saying al-Qaeda
[45:56.160 --> 46:00.360]  are now redefined as the heroes of democracy and we're gonna bomb the
[46:00.360 --> 46:04.760]  country in order to protect them so it's because that's the globalist asset
[46:04.760 --> 46:09.720]  they've got in each country isn't this a replay of Kermit Roosevelt and the and
[46:09.720 --> 46:15.920]  the CIA and and British MI6 in 1953 with Mosaic who was even pro-western but
[46:15.920 --> 46:20.800]  wouldn't give everything over to BP then Anglo-American oil and so they use the
[46:20.800 --> 46:24.320]  Muslim extremists to overthrow the government then they double cross them
[46:24.320 --> 46:29.040]  and put the puppet Shaw in certainly the al-Qaeda is a force of
[46:29.040 --> 46:34.640]  obscurantism that opposes modernization westernization industrialization and
[46:34.640 --> 46:38.160]  everything else the Muslim Brotherhood which is the mother of al-Qaeda was used
[46:38.160 --> 46:43.480]  by the CIA to oppose President Nasser in Egypt but right now I think the parallel
[46:43.480 --> 46:48.160]  we ought to think of is look at look at gates look at the people around Carter
[46:48.160 --> 46:53.720]  and Brzezinski and then Reagan creating al-Qaeda and giving them these
[46:53.720 --> 46:59.080]  finger missiles and other means imagine what happens if this group this gaggle of
[46:59.080 --> 47:05.640]  terrorists in in Benghazi imagine if they take over the oil revenue of Libya
[47:05.640 --> 47:10.400]  they're gonna have billions and billions of dollars and the CIA is now
[47:10.400 --> 47:14.920]  arming them they're smuggling in or shipping in weapons from Egypt with it
[47:14.920 --> 47:18.280]  with the collusion of the Egyptian army by the way that's in the associated
[47:18.280 --> 47:23.600]  press they're not even denying that and and and then a month a month a year two
[47:23.600 --> 47:26.800]  years later everyone will forget that the West backed them then we'll have to
[47:26.800 --> 47:31.400]  invade again because al-Qaeda has now taken control of Libya and no one will
[47:31.400 --> 47:36.320]  even remember this right and al-Qaeda can then install you know bigger and
[47:36.320 --> 47:39.800]  better surface-to-air missiles on the northern coast and interdict all the
[47:39.800 --> 47:45.240]  traffic in the Mediterranean so goodbye Mediterranean al-Qaeda has always been the
[47:45.240 --> 47:49.080]  globalist weapon and they're now using it again I mean how obvious is this have
[47:49.080 --> 47:55.360]  to get Webster what do you make of the US F-15E fighter bomber having technical
[47:55.360 --> 47:59.600]  difficulties and crashing outside Benghazi they were denying that US
[47:59.600 --> 48:03.360]  aircraft were dropping bombs they were only cruise-missiling now Gates is
[48:03.360 --> 48:07.360]  announced they're gonna pull back aircraft looks like Gaddafi may have
[48:07.360 --> 48:11.440]  some missiles that folks don't know about I think you're gonna find out what
[48:11.440 --> 48:14.280]  he has the further you delve into it you're gonna find some unpleasant
[48:14.280 --> 48:18.680]  surprises I'm very skeptical about the fact that when the NATO supermen get get
[48:18.680 --> 48:24.160]  the shot down or brought down it's never because of unfriendly action but I
[48:24.160 --> 48:28.400]  think the main thing is the entire command structure is now in chaos because
[48:28.400 --> 48:32.120]  Obama for his demagogic political reasons by the way that's confirmed the
[48:32.120 --> 48:35.720]  NATO alliance is completely breaking up absolutely oh yeah what do you make oh
[48:35.720 --> 48:39.320]  there's so many questions what do you make of Putin coming out and saying this
[48:39.320 --> 48:42.520]  is a new crusade it's horrible and Menyedyev for the first time ever
[48:42.520 --> 48:48.080]  breaking and in rebuking Putin well that that's a clear choice for the voters in
[48:48.080 --> 48:52.120]  Russia and given the fact that the average Russian voter deeply suspicious of
[48:52.120 --> 48:56.440]  the United States I think that would have to be advantage Putin and indeed
[48:56.440 --> 49:00.040]  advantage for the world because it's important for somebody to say no to
[49:00.040 --> 49:03.200]  these things they've always claimed that Menyedyev was a puppet of Putin but
[49:03.200 --> 49:06.480]  you've disagreed and said that it's two different groups well then well then what
[49:06.480 --> 49:10.680]  is the real grouping in Russia and certainly the the oligarchs the the
[49:10.680 --> 49:16.080]  people the new orish the people who have gotten filthy rich privatizing the
[49:16.080 --> 49:20.400]  state property of the Soviet Union have now gravitated to Medvedev that would
[49:20.400 --> 49:24.960]  include Anatoly Chewbias who's the leader leader of that group but look the
[49:24.960 --> 49:30.760]  thing about the command structure is that the Italians say you can't use our
[49:30.760 --> 49:35.880]  seven bases unless it's under NATO command the British say no we want
[49:35.880 --> 49:41.480]  British command the French Sarkozy who is a little Napoleon says no it has to
[49:41.480 --> 49:46.640]  be French command the Arabs they have one Arab so far right the Arab
[49:46.640 --> 49:51.000]  big leaves have come down to Qatar the only one is this the little country
[49:51.000 --> 49:56.520]  where Al Jazeera comes from Qatar and any other Arabs they might get so they've
[49:56.520 --> 50:00.960]  only got the British base they've only got the British base they've got well
[50:00.960 --> 50:05.160]  they they so far they have had that these the Sigonella Sicily in the seven
[50:05.160 --> 50:10.200]  Italian bases but the Italian no no by base I meant I meant Qatar and Al
[50:10.200 --> 50:14.120]  Jazeera is a known British front right there that's well that they couldn't be
[50:14.120 --> 50:17.520]  clearer right there they're part of their part of this enterprise of killing
[50:17.520 --> 50:22.760]  Arabs there in in Libya but the the broader question is because of
[50:22.760 --> 50:26.840]  Obama's cowardice because of Obama's unwillingness to take responsibility for
[50:26.840 --> 50:30.400]  what he's actually doing to give a noble office address look you in the eye and
[50:30.400 --> 50:35.400]  say I'm attacking we've now got this chaos one of the main principles of
[50:35.400 --> 50:39.880]  military operations is unity of command and if you don't have unity of
[50:39.880 --> 50:44.920]  command you have big trouble right now NATO has really big trouble Norway yeah
[50:44.920 --> 50:48.000]  they can't lead without the United States stay there Webster one more
[50:48.000 --> 50:51.720]  segment to see where you think all this is going but everything Webster is
[50:51.720 --> 50:56.200]  talking about is all confirmed mainstream news hidden in plain view Al Qaeda
[50:56.200 --> 51:02.160]  openly works for the banksters stir up crises we all know that Berkey water

[54:23.680 --> 54:30.960]  our history issue a directive a resolution and within less than 48
[54:30.960 --> 54:35.000]  hours the United States starts attacking a country you have this F-15
[54:35.000 --> 54:39.800]  shot down right over Benghazi where reportedly Gaddafi's rolled in he's
[54:39.800 --> 54:44.960]  shelling the Al Qaeda people the supposed heroes I'm sorry I don't like Al Qaeda
[54:44.960 --> 54:49.320]  folks I apologize I'll be seen as unpatriotic and Webster Griffin
[54:49.320 --> 54:53.640]  Tarpley is our guest Webster this is really unraveling quickly what do you
[54:53.640 --> 54:59.160]  make of Gates announcing that air allied airstrikes are now to slow the
[54:59.160 --> 55:04.480]  Wall Street Journal reports in lieu of this F-15 going down that reveals it's
[55:04.480 --> 55:09.600]  not just cruise missiles it shows what happens when when stupid imbecilic
[55:09.600 --> 55:14.800]  politicians like like Obama and Sarkozy metal in military this engine among
[55:14.800 --> 55:20.400]  other things this is also calibrated to suit the image of Obama and
[55:20.400 --> 55:25.320]  Sarkozy it's a recipe for disaster Norway has dropped out because of the
[55:25.320 --> 55:30.400]  inclarity of the command Turkey had been a candidate to join Turkey now says
[55:30.400 --> 55:35.200]  they will not join Germany and they're not happy with with with the Sarkozy
[55:35.200 --> 55:39.760]  Germany never came in that's a really important one the United Arab Emirates
[55:39.760 --> 55:43.960]  was supposed to send the military forces they have bugged out because of the
[55:43.960 --> 55:48.960]  backlash in the Arab streets so I think it's clear there's going to be a
[55:48.960 --> 55:56.200]  stalemate at best and at worst Obama will essentially I'm sorry Gaddafi will
[55:56.200 --> 56:01.760]  do what Saddam Hussein did at the end of the first Gulf War and proceed despite
[56:01.760 --> 56:06.840]  the presence of a no-fly zone and bombing to reassert the territorial
[56:06.840 --> 56:11.800]  integrity of the country against these armed gangs and the Financial Times
[56:11.800 --> 56:16.560]  reports he's got giant hordes of gold the true international currency that
[56:16.560 --> 56:22.080]  he's paying mercenaries with well he's fighting the this group and he has said
[56:22.080 --> 56:25.920]  that they are terrorists and now I was a little bit skeptical of that at the
[56:25.920 --> 56:29.840]  beginning but now I find indeed these these are indeed terrorists if you look
[56:29.840 --> 56:35.280]  at that city of Ghana if they have 80,000 people and they said 51 suicide
[56:35.280 --> 56:41.240]  bombers to Iraq that means you get one terrorist for every 1500 or 1600
[56:41.240 --> 56:45.920]  people that's that's a pretty heavy concentration and by the way there's an
[56:45.920 --> 56:49.720]  Arab supremacist vein here that you alluded to but doing some studying on
[56:49.720 --> 56:54.080]  Libya Gaddafi's been about unifying Africa and not persecuting black
[56:54.080 --> 56:59.800]  Africans that live in Libya this eastern area has been a Libya North Africa for
[56:59.800 --> 57:04.480]  Arabs only group and that seems to be the core of a lot of their vitriol as
[57:04.480 --> 57:09.840]  they hunt black Libyans down and kill them you notice the liberal media isn't
[57:09.840 --> 57:13.920]  picking up on that ethnic cleansing they don't care it's very interesting they
[57:13.920 --> 57:19.040]  focus on the fact that the Arab League in a moment of total bribery approved
[57:19.040 --> 57:24.960]  this operation the African Union said no before it and the African Union continues
[57:24.960 --> 57:30.240]  to say no and demand a ceasefire but the African Union is mainly black African
[57:30.240 --> 57:35.760]  states so they don't count the whole thing has a tremendous anti-black racist
[57:35.760 --> 57:40.440]  overtone against black Africans probably also because of the reasons you said I'm
[57:40.440 --> 57:44.880]  wondering you look at these people who are now leading that that rebel council
[57:44.880 --> 57:49.800]  in the Benghazi there's Eunice and Jaleel and Eunice and Jaleel are the
[57:49.800 --> 57:54.480]  Defense Minister and the Interior Minister of previous governments and
[57:54.480 --> 57:58.980]  these guys have now been re-baptized heroes of democracy Hillary Clinton when
[57:58.980 --> 58:04.960]  she had her mixer with the terrorist leadership there in Paris she met another
[58:04.960 --> 58:12.360]  one of these characters and well at that point she she met Mahmood Jibril who
[58:12.360 --> 58:16.600]  represents this leadership council I'm wondering whether he was actually from
[58:16.600 --> 58:20.060]  Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb so she would have been
[58:20.060 --> 58:25.160]  cavorting with with terrorists on that occasion so again if you think that the
[58:25.160 --> 58:29.480]  the big operation of the US right now also involves Pakistan that's been the
[58:29.480 --> 58:33.280]  third Jaleel do five more minutes and I promise callers a full hour of calls
[58:33.280 --> 58:37.760]  we're going to shift gears into the Fukushima cover-up that's intensifying
[58:37.760 --> 58:41.800]  and then we'll get back into oblivion
[58:43.360 --> 58:50.000]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network
[58:51.000 --> 58:56.040]  Alex has told you that the mid-east uprisings over food prices and shortages
[58:56.040 --> 59:00.080]  caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide we're seeing the impact right
[59:00.080 --> 59:03.880]  here in the United States ethanol that was supposed to reduce petroleum use
[59:03.880 --> 59:08.880]  and fuel prices hit a 30-month high in February and pump prices are expected to
[59:08.880 --> 59:13.560]  reach $5 a gallon because of shipping costs food is being priced out of the
[59:13.560 --> 59:18.320]  reach of millions of Americans with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days

[01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:23.320]  Alex Jones
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:42.040]  all right we are now into hour number two it is the 22nd day of March 2011 your
[01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:44.720]  calls coming up in the next segments will also get into the latest
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:49.400]  developments in Fukushima the ongoing cover-up and intensifying radiation
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:54.200]  levels nuclear plant contaminate sea after damage to fuel rods tiny amount of
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:57.760]  radioactive particles reach Iceland so it's now gone all the way over North
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:01.960]  America and orders of reporting it's reached Iceland Fukushima radiation
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:05.600]  levels cover-up we have a report on that US military considers mandatory
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:11.480]  evacuations in Japan that is all coming up CNN reporting so they're evacuating
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:14.960]  even further and talking about forced evacuations you better believe that we've
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:18.360]  got some serious meltdowns here they admit partial meltdowns that we pray not
[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:22.280]  full Chernobyl situation Webster we got about three and a half minutes left
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:27.080]  Webster tarply finishing up I guess we need to get the word out that al Qaeda is
[01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:32.320]  publicly working with the Western powers to overthrow Qaddafi that's very bold of
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:35.160]  them but from what you're saying and what the media is reporting this
[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:40.080]  coalition's falling apart things aren't starting to go too well it's a very very
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:46.280]  cynical policy of power politics it has nothing to do with democracy or human
[01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:50.680]  rights or anything of this sort but what the finding is again from West Point
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:56.680]  the document is called al Qaeda's foreign fighters published at the the
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:00.520]  combating terrorism center of the Department of Social Sciences US
[01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:05.120]  Military Academy West Point New York December 2007 it's all in there there's
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:09.680]  also an article in the Asia Tribune it's not another publication with a similar
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:15.440]  name the Asia Tribune by Daya Gamaj that gives a very useful summary and again
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:21.400]  the finding is that Libya gave more terrorists and suicide bombers to al Qaeda
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:29.120]  Iraq attacks than any other country in proportion to population 20 per million
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:34.440]  that's more than twice as much as the Saudi Arabian contribution and this
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:38.600]  contribution was not spread equally over Libya but it was overwhelmingly
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:45.560]  concentrated in northeast Libya the area of Benghazi to Brooke and Darna and
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:49.640]  that's exactly the area which is the hotbed of the rebellion this this group
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:54.600]  that had already rebelled in 1995 you remember the David Shaler affair when
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:59.440]  Shaler said he was sitting at MI5 he noticed that MI6 the British equivalent
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:05.600]  of the CIA had hired al Qaeda to try to kill Gaddafi well that failed although it
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:10.000]  did kill some people but in in the coordination with that there was an
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:16.680]  insurrection in about 1995 96 of these same terrorist characters in northeast
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:21.480]  Libya which was then crushed by by Gaddafi so that's the origin of the of
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:25.040]  the bad blood so we've already had the al Qaeda boys trying to overthrow Gaddafi
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:28.600]  before but how dare you talk about about al Qaeda Webster these are loving good
[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:33.240]  people I'm afraid that that mythology now falls to the ground and we see that
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:38.480]  this is simply a group of armed thugs if I dare say it they're really mercenaries
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:41.520]  they're mercenaries but they are some of them of course are fanatics or
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:46.400]  psychotics they generally fit the profile of armed patsies they think they're
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:49.840]  doing one thing they're actually doing something else although the problem with
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:54.280]  this is you get into this Frankenstein effect if you create this suppose they do
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:58.760]  see his control of Cyranaica northeast Libya suppose they see his control of the
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:03.480]  oil revenues and they are armed by the CIA through now they can destabilize
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:08.400]  Tunisia to the west Egypt to the east they can project power and into the
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:13.480]  med into the Mediterranean and then the Italian island of Lumpard is not far
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:20.000]  away Italy's not far away neither is Spain France Greece Cyprus all sorts of
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:25.920]  European coasts so this is a piece of insanity and it's not the globalist
[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:30.120]  want destabilization kamikaze states as you warned during the election three
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:34.400]  years ago but those of us who wanted to defend civilization have to condemn this
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:40.320]  as a piece of strategic lunacy because it sets you up for a new round of mayhem
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:47.280]  if these characters succeed and I think it portrays the the role of Gaddafi I
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:50.480]  think in a much different light when you see that he's and that's why the
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:53.880]  globalist that's why the globalists are so desperate to make sure they defeat
[01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:58.320]  Gaddafi keep the Domino's following Webster partly dot net our sites info

[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:58.000]  with the power of a thousand sons and I said they did this now now when we're in
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:01.320]  the middle of the biggest most threatening disaster to mankind in
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:08.280]  history and I realized the globalist had shown their face in the game of poker
[01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:16.120]  it's called a tell everyone I know here said the same thing verbatim what they
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:23.960]  started a new war now Alex we in Japan are the canaries in the mine shaft we
[01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:28.080]  know we're not being told the whole truth about radiation exposure the face of
[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:33.280]  death has smiled at me and the only thing I can do is smile back I'm not
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:37.240]  afraid of dying I've had a good life but it makes me very sad to see the

[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:55.320]  we're praying for a resolution to the nuclear crisis but the bottom line is
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:59.720]  we don't know what the truth is now the world is on the edge of a dark abyss
[01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:06.280]  here is the solution the time is now the time is now for people around the
[01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:11.080]  world starting in the US to put down their remote controls unplug their TVs
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:16.160]  and put their mind control devices and storage now is the time to take to the
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:23.080]  streets and millions in the millions in peaceful gondies nonviolent mass protests
[01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:29.360]  against the wars now is the time for everybody to shout no no more wars it
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:34.000]  has to stop now the elites have the technology but we've got the numbers
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:39.480]  absolutely big big big daddy I appreciate your call thank you and if
[01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:42.640]  you're headed by being cut off no other talk radio show that's big would have
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:47.400]  somebody talk for two minutes on you know you watch Fox News CNN there's
[01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:51.520]  constant ban banter back and forth their callers on the regular shows at about
[01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:55.760]  45 seconds if I don't give callers 20 minutes they get mad but yes very good
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:13:00.640]  points they are having the children in and around Fukushima still in school
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:04.560]  though there's 26 times the radiation in the food and water that's been reported
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:10.360]  as of two days ago Obama also announced new gun control draconian legislation
[01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:16.040]  during the Japan crisis just three days into it while diverting us with NCA a
[01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:20.560]  March Madness distractions and talking about the American people being in a
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:27.520]  trance and giggling they think it's very funny and this war is a brazen criminal
[01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:31.440]  operation there's no doubt about it will in New York you're on the air go ahead
[01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:36.120]  hi Alex I think you should give that big daddy a job you know I sounded pretty
[01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:43.200]  good to me I'm saying building seven if anyone anyone listening just just if
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:46.400]  you haven't done it get get the video building seven and just show it to
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:50.160]  people show it to anyone you can do because that's like the smoking gun
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:53.200]  obviously yeah we have the video the police saying get back they're gonna
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:57.680]  blow up building seven and they blew it up on 9-11 yeah yeah yeah so I mean I
[01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:00.520]  just want to remind everybody out there if they haven't done it to go do that and
[01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:05.520]  I think you want to say you handled the whole Jupiter Saturn controversy with
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:10.000]  grace and dignity the other day and I appreciate that I don't think it was a
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:15.640]  controversy that I was talking about studies in the solar system now show
[01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:20.440]  that large meteors and comets hit planets more often than people had thought
[01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:24.000]  and I said Saturn was hit by Shoemaker leavey comments instead of Jupiter
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.720]  that's what happens when you talk three hours a day but sir do you do you will
[01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:32.440]  have any any comments about the Libya situation any any comments about the
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:38.400]  ongoing cover-up of the ongoing meltdowns at Fukushima well I think you
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:41.840]  I think you're saying it pretty well man and I agree with a lot of what's
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:45.520]  saying and there's a lot of a lot of BS going on and thank you will I appreciate
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:48.520]  that I'm gonna move quickly now through the calls Tim in Washington you're on
[01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:54.960]  the air yeah hello I said a question whenever do you saw the news it kind of
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:58.640]  seems like Obama's just been in government he's not going to Congress to
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:03.160]  enact wars and it seems that the United States is gone and we're not just a
[01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:08.200]  part of the United Nations well that is this is the first time that a United
[01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:12.000]  Nations resolutions come out and Congress had nothing to say there wasn't
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:17.640]  even a petty resolution much less a declaration and now we take orders
[01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:22.480]  directly from the UN and we have the quotes it's in one of the news articles
[01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:25.960]  I have today where Obama during the campaign said the president doesn't have
[01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:32.720]  the power to unilaterally launch wars unless we're already under attack and
[01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:38.680]  then the executive has that power and and clearly this is the country another
[01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:43.440]  step for globalism just like when Obama became the head of the UN Security
[01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:48.880]  Council for a term that's in our film fall the republic that's why Kissinger
[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:52.840]  and all other globalists were there just smiling when he became president and
[01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:56.720]  the head of the UN Security Council which is totally unconstitutional it
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:16:02.800]  violates article one section nine just absolutely incredible so is he a
[01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:08.000]  dictator now well here's the deal everybody over the year sends me emails I
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:14.000]  see comments saying Alex where's the martial law well when the Pentagon makes
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:18.800]  a deal to steal all the veterans death benefits outside of law that's martial
[01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:24.240]  law when Michigan announces let's put it on the screen a Detroit Free Press the
[01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:29.320]  headline Michigan declares financial martial law that means the regular law
[01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:33.320]  the regular checks and balances the bill of rights the Constitution don't
[01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:41.240]  apply when Obama has the EPA implement carbon taxes and restrictions on new
[01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:46.680]  power plants outside of law that's a dictatorship of the bureaucracy there's
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:51.800]  the Atlantic magazine Michigan declares financial martial law when they set up
[01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:56.360]  federally funded checkpoints with police taking blood without warrants that's
[01:16:56.360 --> 01:17:01.360]  martial law when they have TSA now at highway checkpoints making you drive
[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:04.880]  under high-powered radiation scanners that shoot through your car and you that's
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:09.440]  martial law when the TSA demands to stick their hands down your pants that's
[01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:13.160]  hardcore martial law when they have free speech zones and you've got to have a
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:16.840]  permit that they can deny to have a demonstration on a street corner that's
[01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:20.880]  martial law but they don't call it martial law in the executive orders and
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:26.280]  the John Warner Defense Authorization Act and PDD 51 they say the president for
[01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:30.560]  any reason or the bureaucracy for any reason can suspend any law and Congress
[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:35.880]  for six months all of that continuing and expanding when Obama says he's above
[01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:40.440]  the law and can order torture as Bush did that's tyranny that's martial law but
[01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:44.520]  they don't call it that they call it security they call it civil emergency
[01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:50.240]  they call it protecting America and so all these bozos are looking for martial
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:53.800]  law now with the internet kill switch going in now with the announcements that
[01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:57.920]  they're gonna have government takeover and break-ins over radio and TV with
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:02.640]  announcements 9,000 telescreens going in malls and shopping centers saying watch
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:06.960]  your neighbors with with big brother announcements that's martial law that's
[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:12.000]  right out of 1984 it's here we're going into it and now they're announcing
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.360]  mergers of the big telecoms that they're gonna restrict what websites you can
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:19.600]  visit and that they're gonna derank content farms like drudge report comm
[01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:25.360]  and info wars calm it's all slow heating up the water boiling us to death with
[01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:29.480]  yuppies running around saying I don't see tyranny as the bankers devalue their
[01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:36.560]  currency with a dollar devaluation tax show show I mean it's not answering your
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:41.240]  question well and it says it does but I just I just think the American public
[01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:45.080]  are just like completely hooked on some annex and so as you just explained it
[01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:49.280]  they just don't realize that they're under this type of tyranny because it's
[01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:54.880]  not the government is since 96 listens to your cell phones without warrants and
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:59.880]  can dial in even when they're turned off they admit the public schools issue
[01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:05.360]  laptops and watch the kids at home and announce it themselves I mean our
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:11.320]  laptops watching you at home without warrants that's beyond martial law yeah
[01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:16.160]  I put my phone in a box as soon as I get home I don't I don't trust it well
[01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:20.240]  that's a good move my friend I mean they admit that they're just surveilling
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:24.920]  everything anything else said sir yeah I had one quick question for you do you
[01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:29.000]  know what the saturation level is for populations greater than 500,000 due to
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:35.560]  Fukushima reactor admissions and work I get that information I don't ask that
[01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:40.000]  question again do you know what the saturation level for populations over
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:45.080]  500,000 due to the projected emissions of the Fukushima reactors you I know what
[01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:49.880]  the saturation is yeah before we get sick and before we start showing signs of
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:55.560]  radiation sickness dr. Bob Bowman actually sent me an email with all those
[01:19:55.560 --> 01:20:00.360]  numbers it varies and it's debated I'll try to answer that when we come back
[01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:05.040]  dr. David Berry has provided excellent advice for all those interested in
[01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:09.600]  practical economics and sound money it's certainly worth reading that's what
[01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:14.480]  congressman Ron Paul said about cha-ching wisdom 123 practical universal truths

[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:42.720]  look here's the deal Tim I'm not a medical doctor I'm not a physicist but
[01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:46.040]  I've had them on to break down the different ranges that are seen as
[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:52.280]  dangerous it's too hard to break down you've got scores of different radioactive
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:25:02.560]  isotopes tritium zion xenon radioactive iodine I mean the list goes on on
[01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:07.520]  uranium plutonium but generally uranium plutonium are pretty heavy so they tend
[01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:11.000]  to fall out of the atmosphere but a little bit of it gets on say a feather
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:16.560]  or some grass or a cobweb something that they can get airborne then it can get
[01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:20.080]  picked up and brought across but most of it's going in the ocean and they are
[01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:23.840]  reporting in the news today that in Bloomberg at the ocean off of that
[01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:27.480]  suckers what's really radioactive it's built right on the ocean and the winds
[01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:31.840]  are blowing out there so you got to watch Pacific seafood now those those
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:36.280]  currents go right up to Alaska and all those big fisheries where we get the
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:40.440]  bottom-feeding crabs the mollusk that we eat you know restaurants we buy at the
[01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:44.800]  supermarket they I mean it's a butterfly effect there's just no way to even
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:49.480]  calculate it we just know overall it's not good and and culture runs around
[01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:53.240]  saying it's nutritious for you even low levels of radiation according to the
[01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:57.120]  government that you eat the food year after year that's had it fall on the
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:03.600]  soil you get the recurring low-level radioactivity it bio accumulates up to
[01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:10.480]  a higher level of radioactivity but many doctors we've had on say you know you
[01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:17.480]  don't take potassium iodine until the radiation is a hundred times what they
[01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:22.160]  say is safe levels but then again I'm not going to give medical advice it's a
[01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:30.680]  very very very complex issue okay but it's good obviously to have potassium
[01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:33.360]  iodine in your medicine cabinet it's good to have gas masks it's good to have
[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:37.240]  storeable food it's good to have a bug out pack it's good to have an evacuation
[01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:44.360]  plan for nuclear fallout disasters plants blowing up forest fires earthquakes
[01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:49.120]  riots that's the big one with the economy imploding Michael Louisiana you're on
[01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:54.280]  the air so I just want to tell you thank you for all the information I'm trying
[01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:59.080]  to wake up everybody I can I guess I was more appalled at the mr. Obama speech
[01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:05.120]  Barry Centera of his speech that he had did and he just mentioned so casually
[01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:10.120]  about the UN doing this and I'm going what the hell is going on with our
[01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:15.040]  country when the hell did we give authority to the UN about controlling
[01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:20.600]  anything America does America better I'm sorry Alex I get to let me just add
[01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:24.760]  something here Mike George W. Bush I called for his impeachment Jerome
[01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:28.840]  course he did he's a mainline conservative Ron Paul talked about it when
[01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:35.120]  Bush signed secretly the North American Union SPP agreement at Baylor in 2005
[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:40.080]  no one even hardly talked about it we've been going under this system in 2007
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:43.800]  he gave a press conference in my film in-game with Merkel and Barroso of the
[01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:48.360]  EU saying they were merging the North American Union with the EU with the
[01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:54.480]  North Atlantic agreement I mean it was right there so yes but this is the first
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:28:00.360]  time a president has become the sitting member of the Security Council for that
[01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:05.520]  round a year and a half ago that was treason and now well the UN says so we
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:12.000]  got to attack the UN now becoming our boss other countries who voted in that
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:17.460]  now trumping our Congress who didn't even have time to respond and then the
[01:28:17.460 --> 01:28:21.840]  servile Congress only a few Democrats are complaining the servile Congress the
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:25.280]  Republicans and Democrats went along with it regardless of what you think of
[01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:29.200]  this new war the UN's now our boss
[01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:33.840]  crazy that's ludicrous to think that the UN is our boss I refuse to let the UN be
[01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:37.840]  our boss we're still Americans well this is the true birth we are seeing the
[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:42.360]  birth of true world government right now foreign IMF set our dollar value G20
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:47.400]  sets it the wars are launched by the UN unelected bureaucrats and the North
[01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:52.640]  American SPP agreement they they set the agenda I mean it's he follows UN rules
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:57.760]  on carbon emissions I mean we're under world government right now it's here
[01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:02.680]  whether you wanted or not I cannot believe it's here but you woke me up to
[01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:06.400]  it about a year ago and just over the last couple of months especially with
[01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:10.560]  you can't tell me that the light radiation just from the leakage hit our
[01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:15.440]  coast and we're ready and we have we have documented it and then that's right
[01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:19.600]  the stuff from the stuff from eight nine days ago hits Friday they say it
[01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:23.260]  increased then all the really bad stuff from the explosions we now hear nothing
[01:29:23.260 --> 01:29:29.160]  but the Icelanders are saying we're getting radiation Iceland I mean what
[01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:34.040]  is Iceland what is Iceland twelve thousand miles away from Japan I'm sorry
[01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:44.160]  go ahead I Mike I kind of missed it but I understand the last part but thank you
[01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:49.760]  so much I understand you're you're angry Charles Steve Denise Alex in Japan
[01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:55.960]  we'll go to you first we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and
[01:29:55.960 --> 01:30:02.920]  the GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:07.240]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation
[01:30:07.240 --> 01:30:10.600]  could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new
[01:30:10.600 --> 01:30:14.520]  energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:18.720]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:23.160]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:27.920]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:31.720]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:35.320]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:39.680]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:42.840]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:46.520]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:09.680]  caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide we're seeing the impact right
[01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:13.440]  here in the United States ethanol that was supposed to reduce petroleum use
[01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:18.440]  and fuel prices hit a 30 month high in February and pump prices are expected to
[01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:23.120]  reach $5 a gallon because of shipping costs food is being priced out of the
[01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:27.920]  reach of millions of Americans with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days

[01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:29.880]  lost her bobbles to my tree many a soldier many a soldier shed his life
[01:33:29.880 --> 01:33:36.280]  blood on my blade drink up this next one the master taught me in the spring of
[01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:49.080]  25 a little bit of this role but I am still alive I was a sailor I was born
[01:33:49.080 --> 01:34:00.160]  upon the tide with the sea I did buy I sailed a school around the Horn of
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:11.160]  Mexico I went off the world the mains a little blow and when the yards broke off
[01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:21.880]  they said that I got killed but I'm a living still but I'm living still I was
[01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:30.000]  a damn building across the river deep and wide we're stealing what it is
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:36.040]  cool place called bolder a place called bolder on the wild called
[01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:43.760]  think about what those Japanese are doing those brave men in there now 9 10
[01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:53.000]  days into fighting intensely against that situation that's unfolding we're
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:57.760]  gonna go back to Alex in Japan Charles Trey Mike James and others by the way
[01:34:57.760 --> 01:35:01.760]  Alex twittered us this morning at twitter.com forward slash real Alex Jones
[01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:05.520]  and we hit him back and said try to get in Alex with another report from you
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:11.640]  from Japan so we'll be talking to Alex here in a moment before I go any further
[01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:16.560]  I want to remind listeners we have the online video bookstore we also have the
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:19.600]  Patriot t-shirts I can't tell you how many people I talked to that wear the
[01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:24.760]  info or shirts the wide variety we have and how many people they meet on the
[01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:28.560]  street some that become very good friends or girlfriends or boyfriends some
[01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:34.040]  folks wearing the shirts have met their future spouse great way to realize how
[01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:38.200]  many people are really awake out there is to wear a Ron Paul 2012 shirt or a you

[01:35:57.320 --> 01:36:01.760]  times the response we've ever had to another one I mean we've had hundreds
[01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:05.000]  and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds in fact Phil's
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:10.320]  estimating is close to a thousand videos sent in can you imagine show
[01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:14.240]  victims of our own success everybody that entered the contest is a winner but
[01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:18.760]  we'll announce the $7,000 first place the $2,000 second place the thousand
[01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:23.240]  dollar third place it was very hard but I will announce that tomorrow so Phil
[01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:28.440]  don't let me forget we've posted the last 10 finalist the top 10 finalists
[01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:33.200]  yesterday but if you want to see those but the top three winners will be posted

[01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:50.480]  here in just a moment I wish I had the money to pay everybody that entered but
[01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:54.200]  we'd be bankrupt just absolutely incredible job to everybody and the
[01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:58.680]  amount of information that got out the amount of activism the incredible
[01:36:58.680 --> 01:37:03.000]  production quality all of it it just blew us away but we got to be careful
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:11.400]  about doing these contents now because before it took hundreds of hours of man
[01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:16.840]  hours to to watch all this now it became insane I mean just insane Phil has
[01:37:16.840 --> 01:37:20.600]  been spending basically much of his day every day I've been spending hours every
[01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:26.560]  day and Phil's got graphics to do and he produces on the show just trying to go
[01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:30.480]  through all this it's incredible it is and I've talked to so many people in
[01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:35.160]  Los Angeles New York you name it and DC and TV stations and newspapers have
[01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:39.480]  picked up on it who've seen the V for victory campaign it's just incredible so
[01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:42.600]  keep it up folks and it's an example if they do try to shut down the web and
[01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:47.880]  start curtailing information of what we can do with flyers and activism alone
[01:37:47.880 --> 01:37:53.760]  people going up on the sides of fluoride filled containers at government
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:58.200]  facilities and spray painting on the side of them that fluoride is rat poison I

[01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:33.160]  getting through and responding to our Twitter request to you as a good source
[01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:37.080]  of info in Japan I'm gonna go through after you leave us some more of the big
[01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:41.120]  developments in Japan but again radiation being picked up as far away now
[01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:46.440]  as Iceland according to Reuters but our media is basically covering it up
[01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:50.200]  Japanese admit they haven't been able to stop the ongoing meltdowns they're
[01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:54.840]  fearing a complete meltdown the AP is predicting I mean the AP is reporting
[01:39:54.840 --> 01:40:00.720]  what is your take on what's happening Alex well like other callers have said
[01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:06.200]  before they're not telling us everything but not only that but I'm reading
[01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:15.480]  right now on Japan today dot com that the industry minister Danry Kaida he
[01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:22.680]  reportedly forced firefighters to carry out water spring missions in the power
[01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:27.800]  plant so you know they're not telling us the truth and they're sending their
[01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:31.680]  guys out there in the radiation and they're forcing them and if they don't
[01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:37.640]  go they just punish them which is which is not just slavery it's actually
[01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:46.480]  murder if someone doesn't want to go into a radiation bade facility with 600
[01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:53.200]  thousand fuel rods laying around with internal facilities melting down I guess
[01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:56.840]  you could call them cowards because they signed up to be firefighters but you
[01:40:56.840 --> 01:41:00.200]  certainly can't and I'm not calling them cowards but you certainly can't order
[01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:06.840]  them in how about these plant officials and and culture and everybody that built
[01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:11.720]  these reactors on fault lines that tell us radiation is good for us how about
[01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:16.800]  and culture get a shovel and go in there and scoop up all the deadly radioactive
[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:21.520]  waste how about she drinks some of it if it's so good how about we see the
[01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:26.000]  government and all the pro nuclear people how about they instead of ordering
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:32.800]  the firefighters and police in there to their deaths no doubt it'll take time to
[01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:35.960]  kill them but the head of the plan is admitted this stuff is deadly we will
[01:41:35.960 --> 01:41:40.280]  kill many of those that have been in there how about all the bureaucrats how
[01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:47.480]  about they all go in there yeah exactly and I mean the locals here the people the
[01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:52.720]  Japanese people I mean they seem they seem all relaxed and like like nothing's
[01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:57.040]  going on but you look at all the foreigners I mean there are their home
[01:41:57.040 --> 01:42:01.960]  countries are telling them to evacuate so I mean what's that all about you know
[01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:06.400]  I mean for me I'm Canadian and the government's been telling us to go back
[01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:11.040]  home but I look at all my Japanese friends here and they're like man it's
[01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:15.840]  okay the government says it's okay so well here's the deal there's almost as
[01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:20.080]  you know no stealing in Japan except by the criminal class against the general
[01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:26.320]  public very few muggings stoic intelligent brave people when they're
[01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:32.920]  ordered but it's also has another name it's called being servile when they
[01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:37.920]  follow orders unto death because of their history of worshiping their Emperor
[01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:43.120]  that goes back to the show guns and then the samurai and but what does it tell
[01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:50.360]  you to have the Pentagon announcing CNN reports US military considers mandatory
[01:42:50.360 --> 01:42:55.920]  evacuations from Japan now they're telling us the radiation is low no big
[01:42:55.920 --> 01:43:01.680]  deal but the military won't get near it now what does that tell you man it's
[01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:07.120]  just scary it's like it's really one side says something and the other one
[01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:10.400]  says something else there who do we believe I'm really worried I don't know
[01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:15.120]  if I should go back home or if I should stay in Tokyo I spent a week back in the
[01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:20.320]  in the South but I had to come back to work but I mean what should I do no one
[01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:24.120]  knows really are you the guy that called the Friday it happened and I told you
[01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:31.760]  to run to the South no yeah well I don't know what to say I mean it's your
[01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:34.680]  decision Alex but God bless you we appreciate your call from Japan anything
[01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:40.200]  else you want to add well I had something but I forgot but I'll just call back
[01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:43.720]  again in another day no no no take a minute think about what they were what
[01:43:43.720 --> 01:43:49.720]  was it you wanted to point out about what's happening in Japan well well like
[01:43:49.720 --> 01:43:56.280]  you well like I was saying the people I'm a teacher I'm an English teacher and I
[01:43:56.280 --> 01:44:01.800]  teach about 12 lessons a day and nobody nobody none of my students are even
[01:44:01.800 --> 01:44:06.680]  worried about it they talk about it but they just mentioned the earthquake they
[01:44:06.680 --> 01:44:10.840]  don't mention like the radiation or anything like they don't know anything
[01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:16.800]  like people are just blinded by the media and like everything so happy and it's
[01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:20.680]  weird it's really well look at Obama he's going around like it's no big deal
[01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:25.200]  hey March Madness traveling to South America you know it's just like hey all
[01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:31.400]  that matters is March Madness yeah what is that it's called people who've been
[01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:35.800]  trained to only care about issues of no significance so they won't be involved
[01:44:35.800 --> 01:44:39.880]  in the game of life so they won't be players in life so they won't control
[01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:44.160]  their own destiny so the globalists can just program them and they'll sell their
[01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:49.120]  soul for style for sports for things that don't matter and meanwhile the
[01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:52.200]  globalists are obsessed with how things really work and controlling things
[01:44:52.200 --> 01:45:00.960]  Alex good to hear from you Charles in California you're on the ear good good
[01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:05.720]  good your quick points and I can hang up and listen to your response if you
[01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:11.440]  prefer I would be great if you guys did a new story just on the updates of the
[01:45:11.440 --> 01:45:17.240]  Gulf cover-up young going illnesses and the geological consequences I think that
[01:45:17.240 --> 01:45:20.960]  were really parallel the cover-up that's going on Japan right now okay well I
[01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:25.000]  mean I mean I was part of in tourist TV show on that large areas of the bottom
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:30.120]  of the Gulf are dead the oil was not dispersed from the surface it was not
[01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:35.480]  cleaned up it was sent to the bottom with a dispersant that itself very toxic
[01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:38.920]  seafood is still testing positive with the toxins they don't care they just
[01:45:38.920 --> 01:45:43.880]  serve it up to everybody here in America and it's another giant cover-up just like
[01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:48.040]  they do with everything else yeah you don't hear anything on mainstream people
[01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:51.960]  have sores you don't hear about you don't hear about Haiti where tens of
[01:45:51.960 --> 01:45:55.800]  thousands are still dying you don't hear anything about the tsunami victims of
[01:45:55.800 --> 01:45:59.320]  six years ago you don't hear that's the point you don't hear about all the
[01:45:59.320 --> 01:46:03.920]  thousands of firefighters and police dying of lung cancers and sinus cancer
[01:46:03.920 --> 01:46:07.040]  from the deadly dust they said was safe to breathe when we now know they
[01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:10.880]  premeditatedly lied knew how deadly it was they know people have short
[01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:15.600]  attention spans exactly I just wanted to connect that you know with Japan cover
[01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:19.320]  up the second of all wasn't there supposed to be a hearing this month on
[01:46:19.320 --> 01:46:25.120]  the Obama search the Obama what certificate I heard there's supposed to
[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:27.800]  be another hearing this month yeah they've been talking they've been talking
[01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:32.400]  Congress about it that's something important to check okay also it's
[01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:36.600]  important to remind people JP Morgan is profiting out the food stamps and is it
[01:46:36.600 --> 01:46:40.600]  true that Goldman Sachs is the only provider that you can buy
[01:46:40.600 --> 01:46:45.960]  treasuries from or is that false and I believe that's false but expanding on
[01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:50.480]  that JP Morgan almost all the food stamp systems nationwide for the states and
[01:46:50.480 --> 01:46:53.840]  the federal government because it's all a federal program but distributed by the
[01:46:53.840 --> 01:46:59.720]  states goes through a JP Morgan system and they use foreign Indian operators so
[01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:03.760]  see under globalism and under federal law they're supposed to you give it to
[01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:08.320]  American companies but they don't great points Charles let's go ahead and talk
[01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:14.560]  to Trey and Alabama Trey you're on the air hey Alex how are you good hey
[01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:19.240]  brother you've heard of uh you're in all the radiation here that you've heard
[01:47:19.240 --> 01:47:23.880]  about out to wait the nuclear research facility have you not in Iraq say that
[01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:27.880]  again it's out to wait the nuclear research facility have you heard about
[01:47:27.880 --> 01:47:39.360]  that Iraq before spell it out to wait the TUW AI THA I know that there was a
[01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:44.320]  reactor bombed by the Israelis in the early 80s I know there is a lot of DU
[01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:48.160]  that's been spread around there but no tell me about it that's correct there's
[01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:52.800]  actually three reactors there there's a French a Russian in a Turkish the French
[01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:57.360]  was the one they talked about the most it was called also rec back in 2005 I
[01:47:57.360 --> 01:48:02.080]  actually was part of the security team that I we had a scientist come in that
[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:06.760]  area it was still guarded it's still to this day guarded by the Israeli I'm
[01:48:06.760 --> 01:48:10.760]  just giving up the Israeli Iraqi defense force there
[01:48:10.760 --> 01:48:18.440]  walked around with this guy with a guy counter many times it was pinged out
[01:48:18.440 --> 01:48:23.120]  there at the length that and we actually went to the top the reactor walked
[01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:28.000]  around no no protect the stuff on the guy said it was a safe area well see
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:32.320]  that's the mind control they just tell you Chernobyl safe they tell you Three
[01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:38.080]  Mile Island safe they tell you that the Japan Fukushima is safe and they tell
[01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:42.840]  and I've seen the reports years ago about those bombed out reactors which
[01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:46.800]  obviously you know threw up radiation and they tell you it's safe and so you're
[01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:50.520]  there with a Geiger counter pegged out and the guy's going hey it's safe because
[01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:56.400]  they told me so yeah he in fact some of my guys are some of one guys he's got
[01:48:56.400 --> 01:49:01.520]  gout he's has bone destiny problems now I'm I have intestinal issues you know
[01:49:01.520 --> 01:49:04.800]  every good place to have any culture come up there and visit I like to take her
[01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:07.760]  for a tour to think that they were well yeah you've already gotten enough so you
[01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:11.960]  just stand outside and you let her go into the old reactor core and then she
[01:49:11.960 --> 01:49:16.200]  can pour water down the side of the rods and then drink it and then she says it
[01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:21.720]  she'll never have cancer I mean she says it's magic it's like magic beans right
[01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:25.440]  and like I said I mean he even got to the part where you open the door in this
[01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:30.360]  grayish bluish powder comes out I mean it was by night and you know he's like oh
[01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:33.600]  we need to get out of here well I mean I'm already covered way to be you know
[01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:37.040]  from when you open the door and we're not on earth was this moron giving you a
[01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:42.920]  tour because he'd been told it was safe I guess you know and in fact this is the
[01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:46.920]  same place where you know the Iraqi people in the actual invasion they took
[01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:50.920]  the yellow cake barrels that have yellow cake up into the streams and they
[01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:56.840]  used it for food food storage and it just it spread out everywhere I mean and
[01:49:56.840 --> 01:50:00.400]  this thing is still meeting it the wind blowing what what can you imagine what
[01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:03.840]  are you know my brothers and sisters over there right now well I mean the
[01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:08.840]  Pentagon waved a magic wand in 1991 and said D use no no longer a problem
[01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:13.280]  radiations I mean before that you weren't allowed to sit on it on a munitions
[01:50:13.280 --> 01:50:20.560]  can that had DU Abrams say bows or what's the gun in the in the Bradley
[01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:24.920]  what's the millimeter of that 25 millimeter yeah so you have DU that now
[01:50:24.920 --> 01:50:29.560]  it's served out the 308s 50 cows now they tell you I mean when you fire those
[01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:33.520]  as you know they ignite as they go out the barrel you get a lethal dose it'll
[01:50:33.520 --> 01:50:38.160]  take 20 years to kill you on average but hey just tell you it's safe brother the

[01:54:21.600 --> 01:54:26.760]  over everybody but the minute you realize that we've already been captured by
[01:54:26.760 --> 01:54:31.240]  fraud that we're occupied by the offshore banks then we can shut about
[01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:36.880]  restoring the Republic but we've got to admit how bad things really are if we're
[01:54:36.880 --> 01:54:42.240]  ever gonna change things knowing is half the battle a couple of announcements
[01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:46.160]  here but I wanted to briefly engage in and no matter where you live you should
[01:54:46.160 --> 01:54:50.920]  push and get the same thing cities in Canada and the US are removing fluoride
[01:54:50.920 --> 01:54:55.160]  right now the EPA's had to admit it is increasing bone cancer brain damage and
[01:54:55.160 --> 01:54:59.480]  lowering IQs the Austin City Council Health and Human Services is having a
[01:54:59.480 --> 01:55:03.840]  hearing on water fluoridation in about an hour and five minutes from now get
[01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:10.680]  down there support them speak and they're having a huge hearing and I hope
[01:55:10.680 --> 01:55:15.840]  that everybody will get down there to the City Council it's the City Hall 301
[01:55:15.840 --> 01:55:22.200]  West 2nd Street Council Chambers room 1001 Austin Texas get in there and say
[01:55:22.200 --> 01:55:25.560]  you don't have a right to forcibly medicaid us and put deadly sodium
[01:55:25.560 --> 01:55:32.320]  fluoride let the criminals in government know it's not a joke the tide is turning
[01:55:32.320 --> 01:55:36.960]  against them there's also a public hearing going on for the next three hours
[01:55:36.960 --> 01:55:43.200]  on HB 1937 to outlaw the TSA sticking their hands in your pants that's going
[01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:49.520]  on there's debate on the house floor going on and they're also in the John H
[01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:54.880]  Reagan building room 120 meeting right now fighting the TSA and that's going on
[01:55:54.880 --> 01:55:58.360]  in many other areas if you want to get down there that's going on for the next
[01:55:58.360 --> 01:56:01.320]  three hours but that fluoride meeting starts in two hours I get a lot of
[01:56:01.320 --> 01:56:04.360]  requests to plug local stuff things we're a nationwide international show I
[01:56:04.360 --> 01:56:07.240]  start plugging each city each county would just be kind of an announcement
[01:56:07.240 --> 01:56:10.000]  show but I want to commend the people that are standing up against this and
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:14.160]  fighting for the truth to get out let's talk to Mike in Illinois Mike you're on
[01:56:14.160 --> 01:56:22.240]  the air I got a couple points one you have a substance called zeolite they
[01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:26.880]  used to 500,000 tons of that in Chernobyl they used it to decontaminate
[01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:31.200]  contaminate the reactors the people in the soil if you guys want to look that
[01:56:31.200 --> 01:56:34.680]  up I know you guys like to make sure everything's documented and whatnot
[01:56:34.680 --> 01:56:40.200]  tell folks what that is because I've read about that zeolite is a natural
[01:56:40.200 --> 01:56:46.200]  recurring rock that will absorb toxins and heavy metals from your body or from
[01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:51.880]  the soil back when when they entered over the feet in the cookies cookies and
[01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:55.160]  biscuits for the kids with this on it they gave it to the cows to get rid of
[01:56:55.160 --> 01:56:58.680]  the radiation in their milk they put it in the ground to get the radiation out
[01:56:58.680 --> 01:57:03.000]  of the soil and the crops it's it's quite an amazing thing and you can buy it
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:07.320]  in small you know they have like little medicine bottles and all that kind of
[01:57:07.320 --> 01:57:10.920]  good stuff that cost you a fortune but you can also buy it by the ton and you
[01:57:10.920 --> 01:57:15.440]  know it's just a it's an amazing substance that detoxifies things all
[01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:21.840]  right we'll check into it reduces radiation as much as 95% in when they
[01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:30.680]  used it in the Chernobyl areas okay anything else yes you know with the
[01:57:30.680 --> 01:57:37.040]  radiation coming our way rain we all know the rain will take radiation out of
[01:57:37.040 --> 01:57:44.160]  the air and I was watching your video report on Ben Livingston yes and I was
[01:57:44.160 --> 01:57:47.480]  wondering how many planes he's actually got and actually if he can put a storm
[01:57:47.480 --> 01:57:53.320]  front in between the West Coast and this common radiation well he's a
[01:57:53.320 --> 01:57:57.280]  meteorologist he's pretty old now I don't even know if he still works there
[01:57:57.280 --> 01:58:02.520]  after calling for a big weather modification company but I appreciate
[01:58:02.520 --> 01:58:06.440]  your call sir absolutely we know they have weather modification there's a lot
[01:58:06.440 --> 01:58:12.440]  they could do to try to block the stuff coming in out of Japan there was an
[01:58:12.440 --> 01:58:17.920]  unusually strong storm in the last week between Japan and the United States
[01:58:17.920 --> 01:58:22.880]  that may have actually caused a lot of the fallout to precipitate into the
[01:58:22.880 --> 01:58:26.680]  Pacific Ocean so that's some good news it could also be seen as carrying it
[01:58:26.680 --> 01:58:29.360]  because the storm continued into the West Coast that's why they've been dodging
[01:58:29.360 --> 01:58:32.720]  raindrops the last four or five days there in Los Angeles with unusually
[01:58:32.720 --> 01:58:37.040]  strong downpours you'll be right back ladies and gentlemen on the other side

[02:00:43.160 --> 02:00:47.280]  your phone calls I looked up with the last caller said about a mineral zeolite
[02:00:47.280 --> 02:00:51.080]  that the Russians did use try to detoxify some of the soils and try to
[02:00:51.080 --> 02:00:54.840]  bind with the radiation at Chernobyl and they claimed it does have some good
[02:00:54.840 --> 02:00:59.520]  effects for that thank you caller for that information who's up next here
[02:00:59.520 --> 02:01:08.560]  John James in Alaska going north to Alaska you're on the air sir pretty
[02:01:08.560 --> 02:01:15.560]  good I just wanted to mention something about harp and the tsunami over there
[02:01:15.560 --> 02:01:22.680]  the day before the tsunami the northern lights were out big time and also heard
[02:01:22.680 --> 02:01:28.080]  rumor that harp was wide open the following week and that days but led up
[02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:38.040]  to the tsunami yeah I really can't operate off rumors though
[02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:45.400]  um yeah I don't know just wanted to mention that well James there's no
[02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:50.680]  doubt that governments have been working on seismic magnetic weapons the
[02:01:50.680 --> 02:01:58.800]  former secretary of defense did admit that back in 97 the issue is we were
[02:01:58.800 --> 02:02:03.540]  hit by a record solar storm and the moon was the closest had been to the
[02:02:03.540 --> 02:02:09.240]  planet in decades and we know the moon controls the tides it also manipulates
[02:02:09.240 --> 02:02:13.480]  the magnetic field and the magma it's not just the ocean that it causes to have
[02:02:13.480 --> 02:02:18.440]  waves but also makes the magma bulge towards the moon and we know Japan has
[02:02:18.440 --> 02:02:23.600]  always had big earthquakes and tsunamis but there's no doubt that harp exists I
[02:02:23.600 --> 02:02:26.480]  just I don't know what I'm supposed to do because I get so many calls saying
[02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:32.360]  well is it harp well I don't know I mean what do you think well I was listening
[02:02:32.360 --> 02:02:39.640]  to heartbell well back a few years ago and he had called the harp and and he
[02:02:39.640 --> 02:02:44.400]  plays this I he plays this message on on this radio he called harp and he was

[02:02:57.320 --> 02:03:04.320]  yeah and and the call stopped got interrupted and it was a general who

[02:06:11.400 --> 02:06:14.800]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[02:06:14.800 --> 02:06:19.320]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:06:19.320 --> 02:06:23.880]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:06:23.880 --> 02:06:27.920]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:06:27.920 --> 02:06:31.720]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:06:31.720 --> 02:06:35.320]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[02:06:35.320 --> 02:06:39.640]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[02:07:03.240 --> 02:07:07.680]  uprisings over food prices and shortages caused by fuel costs are spreading
[02:07:07.680 --> 02:07:12.000]  worldwide we're seeing the impact right here in the United States ethanol that
[02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:16.200]  was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices hit a 30-month high in
[02:07:16.200 --> 02:07:20.840]  February and pump prices are expected to reach $5 a gallon because of
[02:07:20.840 --> 02:07:24.800]  shipping costs food is being priced out of the reach of millions of Americans

[02:08:22.920 --> 02:08:27.680]  take on them and continue with your calls I had a former top CIA analyst
[02:08:27.680 --> 02:08:32.520]  Ronald Reagan and George Bush senior Ray McGovern joining us to give us his
[02:08:32.520 --> 02:08:39.280]  take on what's happening in Libya right now Syria protests spread authorities
[02:08:39.280 --> 02:08:44.200]  pull back the so-called protesters and burned down police stations government
[02:08:44.200 --> 02:08:48.840]  buildings and telecommunications their Western back commando al-Qaeda just like
[02:08:48.840 --> 02:08:54.920]  in Libya but we're not supposed to point that out will you input a resolution
[02:08:54.920 --> 02:08:59.880]  out now about a bombing campaign of Syria maybe we'll our government and
[02:08:59.880 --> 02:09:03.120]  Congress have nothing to say and just click their heels when they say jump and
[02:09:03.120 --> 02:09:07.840]  ask how high probably unrest spread in southern Syria on Monday with hundreds of
[02:09:07.840 --> 02:09:10.440]  people demonstrating against the government in three towns they're the
[02:09:10.440 --> 02:09:14.520]  main city of Darrah but authorities had not used force to quell the latest
[02:09:14.520 --> 02:09:18.440]  protests security forces killed four civilians and demonstrations that
[02:09:18.440 --> 02:09:23.160]  erupted last week of course yesterday they burned things down in the capital
[02:09:23.160 --> 02:09:30.880]  and other cities Libya attacks sparks oil price surge financial times of
[02:09:30.880 --> 02:09:36.320]  London global oil prices rose sharply today and into yesterday yesterday into
[02:09:36.320 --> 02:09:40.520]  today after the initial round of Western bombing against Libya was met by
[02:09:40.520 --> 02:09:45.560]  Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi's promise to have a long drawn-out war which
[02:09:45.560 --> 02:09:51.640]  tenders fears will keep the North African oil nations oil from the market
[02:09:51.640 --> 02:09:59.960]  continuing with the reports out of Libya Russia has urged immediate Libyan
[02:09:59.960 --> 02:10:10.760]  ceasefire also a US fighter jet F-15 E fighter bomber did crash outside Benghazi
[02:10:10.760 --> 02:10:15.040]  in eastern Libya they're claiming it was technical difficulties our aircraft
[02:10:15.040 --> 02:10:19.320]  never get shot down and there I go with mine control that I'm under it's not our
[02:10:19.320 --> 02:10:22.440]  aircraft the globalist bankers have captured America they use our good
[02:10:22.440 --> 02:10:26.920]  men and women in the military as their cannon fodder not our military the US
[02:10:26.920 --> 02:10:31.840]  occupied military force of the New World Order and an aircraft go down Libya US
[02:10:31.840 --> 02:10:36.560]  fighter jet crash lands in field near Benghazi US warplane has crash landed
[02:10:36.560 --> 02:10:41.560]  Libyan field in an area around Benghazi the telegraph can disclose US government
[02:10:41.560 --> 02:10:48.760]  now confirms that an F-15 E fighter bomber that did crash outside of
[02:10:48.760 --> 02:10:54.320]  Benghazi and Gates has now announced that they are going to cut back on the
[02:10:54.320 --> 02:10:59.360]  amount of air sorties into the country and cruise missile attacks whatever that
[02:10:59.360 --> 02:11:03.920]  signifies because I guess the NATO coalition is falling apart right now
[02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:09.040]  Gaddafi again shells rebel towns with US plane down Muammar Gaddafi's forces
[02:11:09.040 --> 02:11:15.560]  attacked two West Libyan towns killing dozens while rebels were pinned down in
[02:11:15.560 --> 02:11:19.640]  the east and NATO tried to resolve a heated fight over who should lead
[02:11:19.640 --> 02:11:26.320]  Western air campaign so that continues gold is key to financing Gaddafi's
[02:11:26.320 --> 02:11:30.440]  struggle financial Times of London reports the international community has
[02:11:30.440 --> 02:11:34.760]  hit Muammar Gaddafi with a raft of sanctions and asset freezing amid the
[02:11:34.760 --> 02:11:39.080]  cutting off of his funding but the embattled Libyan leader is sitting on a
[02:11:39.080 --> 02:11:42.840]  pot of gold the Libyan Central Bank which is under Colonel Gaddafi's control
[02:11:42.840 --> 02:11:50.360]  holds 143.8 tons of gold that's enough to operate for a long time according to
[02:11:50.360 --> 02:11:54.040]  the latest data from the International Monetary Fund although some suspect the
[02:11:54.040 --> 02:12:00.000]  true amount could be several tons higher those reserves are among the top 25 in
[02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:04.280]  the world and are worth 6.5 billion at current prices this is only gonna hurt
[02:12:04.280 --> 02:12:08.640]  the Libyan people enough to pay a small army of mercenaries for months or even
[02:12:08.640 --> 02:12:12.560]  years while some central banks hold their gold reserves in internal vaults in
[02:12:12.560 --> 02:12:17.080]  London New York or Switzerland Libya's bullion is in the country said people
[02:12:17.080 --> 02:12:22.440]  familiar with the country's activities in the gold market continuing allies
[02:12:22.440 --> 02:12:28.920]  expand Libyan military campaign the debate the command but that's
[02:12:28.920 --> 02:12:32.080]  countermanded by the reports they're actually going to cut back to military
[02:12:32.080 --> 02:12:36.800]  campaign this is the big news but yet you have that's the Russian president
[02:12:36.800 --> 02:12:45.000]  breaks ranks with Putin over Libya Russia adjusted today to shift in its
[02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:50.000]  policies after President Dmitry Medvedev for the first time broke ranks
[02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:54.680]  with Vladimir Putin by slamming the premier's comments on the Libyan
[02:12:54.680 --> 02:12:59.880]  conflict in an unexpected dispute that shattered three years of harmony in
[02:12:59.880 --> 02:13:04.360]  Russia's ruling tandem Medvedev publicly rebuked Putin for comments
[02:13:04.360 --> 02:13:08.360]  comparing the UN resolution the loud airstrikes on Libya to a medieval
[02:13:08.360 --> 02:13:13.320]  call to a crusade Putin said the resolution was flawed an example of an
[02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:17.560]  increasing trend of US military intervention in direct contradiction of
[02:13:17.560 --> 02:13:20.880]  Russia's decision to abstain in the vote which in essence allowed the
[02:13:20.880 --> 02:13:24.560]  resolution to be passed analysts said the comments essentially marked the start
[02:13:24.560 --> 02:13:28.840]  of Russia's 2012 presidential election campaign where many expect Putin to seek
[02:13:28.840 --> 02:13:33.560]  to return to the Kremlin after handing over the presidency to Medvedev in 2008
[02:13:33.560 --> 02:13:38.600]  a grim-faced Medvedev told Russians on state television that using words such
[02:13:38.600 --> 02:13:41.160]  as crusade
[02:13:42.320 --> 02:13:47.240]  expeditions by armies in the Middle Ages to end Muslim rule over the Holy Land
[02:13:47.240 --> 02:13:51.720]  in reference to a Muslim country was unacceptable he quote said under no
[02:13:51.720 --> 02:13:56.800]  circumstances is it acceptable to use expressions which essentially lead to a
[02:13:56.800 --> 02:14:01.480]  clash of civilizations as a crusade and so on Medvedev said in a hastily
[02:14:01.480 --> 02:14:05.960]  convened briefing it is unacceptable otherwise everything may end up much
[02:14:05.960 --> 02:14:09.280]  worse compared to what's going on now everyone should remember that Medvedev
[02:14:09.280 --> 02:14:15.120]  said all right so there you go continuing National Journal reports
[02:14:15.120 --> 02:14:18.560]  during Gates visit to Russia Russian Defense Minister calls for immediate
[02:14:18.560 --> 02:14:22.320]  ceasefire and says that civilians are being killed which was roundly rebuked
[02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:30.680]  by Secretary Gates calling it lies calling it lies outright lies is the
[02:14:30.680 --> 02:14:40.280]  full quote okay let me continue with some of the other news and then we will get
[02:14:40.280 --> 02:14:45.200]  back to your phone calls ahead of Ray McGovern coming up who's going to be
[02:14:45.200 --> 02:14:51.080]  joining us it is confirmed by the Combating Terrorism Center at West
[02:14:51.080 --> 02:14:57.960]  Point that Al Qaeda is the group that is in Iraq and also out of Libya and that
[02:14:57.960 --> 02:15:03.080]  basically that that is the group working with NATO in the UN giving the US
[02:15:03.080 --> 02:15:07.960]  orders now to attack Qaddafi so those of you that hate Qaddafi I'm not saying
[02:15:07.960 --> 02:15:11.240]  he's some angel he certainly not now you're working with Al Qaeda that's
[02:15:11.240 --> 02:15:16.080]  also in the Asian Tribune and it's also in the London Telegraph headline the
[02:15:16.080 --> 02:15:23.720]  Western Al Qaeda are on the same side and that it's Al Qaeda attacking him that
[02:15:23.720 --> 02:15:26.600]  is Muammar Qaddafi let's do this let's just go to some more calls and I'll
[02:15:26.600 --> 02:15:31.120]  get into some new developments on the radiation situation in Fukushima clearly
[02:15:31.120 --> 02:15:35.160]  being covered up talk of completely evacuating Americans from Japan the
[02:15:35.160 --> 02:15:38.540]  island of Japan and some economic news I want to hit but right now let's go to
[02:15:38.540 --> 02:15:44.000]  Eric in Canada Eric thanks for holding you're on the air hi Alex good talking
[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:53.000]  to you I just want to float an idea about how to get the troops back home it's
[02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:59.920]  about a boycott on driving like we should have a no driving summer where
[02:15:59.920 --> 02:16:05.320]  we'll just be walking biking or using public transit and avoiding the use of
[02:16:05.320 --> 02:16:09.560]  all petroleum products well for whoever can do that that's a great boycott to
[02:16:09.560 --> 02:16:13.000]  teach the globalist we don't need of the problem is they've built the United
[02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:17.080]  States and Canada in a sprawling way whether you love it or hate it that's
[02:16:17.080 --> 02:16:23.000]  how we're designed and I have to commute you know 25 30 minutes into work
[02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:27.760]  every day and you know my office is out in the middle of an industrial complex
[02:16:27.760 --> 02:16:31.840]  there aren't even really neighborhoods near here so I mean what does somebody
[02:16:31.840 --> 02:16:38.520]  like me do I don't know I mean ride a bicycle or ride a bicycle 20 miles maybe
[02:16:38.520 --> 02:16:42.120]  maybe use alternates fuels if you can or I don't know I mean it's something we
[02:16:42.120 --> 02:16:45.800]  should maybe think about as a pressure well I'm all about trying to move off
[02:16:45.800 --> 02:16:51.400]  the grid I'm actually got my own water well putting in solar I've moved and so
[02:16:51.400 --> 02:16:56.840]  that's a great point okay thanks Alex thank you it just people don't have the
[02:16:56.840 --> 02:17:00.160]  time the energy the capital to do this is taking me years to get to this point
[02:17:00.160 --> 02:17:06.080]  let's go ahead and talk to Mike in California Mike you're on the year he
[02:17:06.080 --> 02:17:10.840]  dropped off Joe in Florida you're on the year hi Alex how's it going I have a
[02:17:10.840 --> 02:17:16.120]  comment about the collapsing of NATO wouldn't it the collapsing of NATO from
[02:17:16.120 --> 02:17:21.400]  a globalist point of view the essential as far as the chess game is concerned in
[02:17:21.400 --> 02:17:27.520]  the defeat of America our country when we eventually renege on our debt to China
[02:17:27.520 --> 02:17:37.600]  and we're attacked by them NATO is a Bilderberg group created organization
[02:17:37.600 --> 02:17:43.760]  even before Bilderberg officially began it was set up by those very individuals
[02:17:43.760 --> 02:17:54.360]  they love it NATO is the army of the UN so I see this is a greedy gamble by NATO
[02:17:54.360 --> 02:17:58.320]  to expand its power and set the precedent through the UN to boss all
[02:17:58.320 --> 02:18:03.480]  these NATO members including the US around I see it more of a balance of
[02:18:03.480 --> 02:18:08.360]  power the globalist want to use the West and NATO as a counterbalance to China
[02:18:08.360 --> 02:18:17.920]  while they invest in both sectors okay all right other than that my only other
[02:18:17.920 --> 02:18:22.840]  comment on what happened in Japan was that was obviously a layer cake of
[02:18:22.840 --> 02:18:28.880]  disaster I mean a plant on a fault with radioactive rods on I mean on top of it
[02:18:28.880 --> 02:18:34.680]  it's just we were discussing it with some friends and I'm not I can't see how
[02:18:34.680 --> 02:18:39.320]  else you could set up a recipe for disaster I mean Japan they have the
[02:18:39.320 --> 02:18:43.640]  tsunamis caused by the earthquakes in one of the worst fault zones on a fault
[02:18:43.640 --> 02:18:48.920]  line on the coast where you have the tsunamis in a rural area where there's
[02:18:48.920 --> 02:18:54.520]  not a lot of support and then storing 39 years of nuclear waste on top of the
[02:18:54.520 --> 02:19:02.160]  explosive facilities you know you couldn't do it any it shows it shows how
[02:19:02.160 --> 02:19:07.600]  reckless the globalist are with genetic engineering gmo weapons systems du
[02:19:07.600 --> 02:19:12.160]  they're crazy they're they're they're they're they're they're they're nihilistic
[02:19:12.160 --> 02:19:18.520]  lunatics right and another comment if you know as far as you know these
[02:19:18.520 --> 02:19:22.360]  political think tanks that make people fight between Republican and Democrat
[02:19:22.360 --> 02:19:27.840]  which basically split human views conservative liberal libertarian
[02:19:27.840 --> 02:19:32.600]  humanitarian I think you know what we should do is you know if they want
[02:19:32.600 --> 02:19:37.000]  people to fight I mean we should fight in a peaceful way to sort of end all this
[02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:42.680]  mayhem and you know come to a realization as to what's really going on in
[02:19:42.680 --> 02:19:46.720]  our country well said Joe and he boiled it down so succinctly they break
[02:19:46.720 --> 02:19:50.000]  everything in the left right to make certain issues left certain issues right
[02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:54.920]  so they can then control the debate and give you a false choice they keep you
[02:19:54.920 --> 02:19:59.640]  in a box of Republican Democrat and say oh it's conservative to like wire
[02:19:59.640 --> 02:20:04.400]  tapping do you want to learn more about preparing for the hard times ahead have
[02:20:04.400 --> 02:20:08.360]  you ever thought about actually getting off the grid and becoming truly self
[02:20:08.360 --> 02:20:12.680]  reliant introducing off the grid news a weekly newsletter for independent

[02:24:13.560 --> 02:24:20.280]  shows I know of that ever got the director project manager of harp on the
[02:24:20.280 --> 02:24:28.320]  show and we were successful in finding the interview and it's from June 24th
[02:24:28.320 --> 02:24:35.880]  2008 dr. Paul Kossy ko sse why tomorrow will play part of that interview but I've

[02:24:44.920 --> 02:24:50.480]  full three-hour I think was four-hour show MP3 with the hour interview with
[02:24:50.480 --> 02:24:55.520]  dr. Paul Kossy the civilian head of harp and I haven't had time to re-listen to
[02:24:55.520 --> 02:24:58.600]  him but I remember the Air Force Colonel breaking in and things during the
[02:24:58.600 --> 02:25:02.480]  breaks and on air just cutting the call off we had to go to break and say why
[02:25:02.480 --> 02:25:05.520]  aren't you there and he came on and talk to us and he did start talking about
[02:25:05.520 --> 02:25:09.640]  igniting the atmosphere at night and so you the listeners are welcome to go
[02:25:09.640 --> 02:25:13.480]  listen to it grab clips of it put it on YouTube it's a big interview that never
[02:25:13.480 --> 02:25:17.920]  got the attention it should have but people tune in randomly one time to the
[02:25:17.920 --> 02:25:21.160]  show and say I see this stuff constantly on the web Alex never talks about the
[02:25:21.160 --> 02:25:25.400]  fellow deserve Alex never talks about harp Alex never talks about the New
[02:25:25.400 --> 02:25:29.120]  World Order Alex never talks about the Vatican Alex never talks about this or
[02:25:29.120 --> 02:25:33.720]  that I talk about it all talk about everything it's just a long show three
[02:25:33.720 --> 02:25:36.680]  to four hours every day we always do three sometimes four hours and overdrive
[02:25:36.680 --> 02:25:42.560]  we cover the full spectrum and this is a big interview big interview we're gonna
[02:25:42.560 --> 02:25:47.960]  get it up on info wars.com the next ten minutes for everybody program
[02:25:47.960 --> 02:25:52.640]  manager the scientific director of the harp information I remember I had his
[02:25:52.640 --> 02:25:56.200]  whole bio at the time I read it out the start of the interview and so that's
[02:25:56.200 --> 02:25:59.000]  that I don't know if he's the director now but I've told Jaren and the other
[02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:03.800]  producers I want to get they contacted us and wanted to dispel rumors and when
[02:26:03.800 --> 02:26:07.800]  they came on it was you know pretty revealing and they wouldn't let Ventura
[02:26:07.800 --> 02:26:12.440]  in there they contacted us as some type of psych warfare op I guess because he's
[02:26:12.440 --> 02:26:18.160]  a listener Anthony and Michigan you're on the air go ahead Alex I want to talk
[02:26:18.160 --> 02:26:22.840]  about something I saw in the footage coverage of the Fukushima thing and
[02:26:22.840 --> 02:26:27.120]  then if you would allow it I have a comment on something Nick baggage sub
[02:26:27.120 --> 02:26:34.280]  dot last week on your show when the first reactor exploded you know typical or
[02:26:34.280 --> 02:26:38.200]  obvious all the stations are showing the same footage over and over and over again
[02:26:38.200 --> 02:26:44.320]  the loop of the explosion I noticed after a couple hours they edited that
[02:26:44.320 --> 02:26:48.240]  footage across the board every station started showing the footage but without
[02:26:48.240 --> 02:26:52.480]  the actual explosion I thought that was kind of odd I wanted to show it to my
[02:26:52.480 --> 02:26:56.880]  wife when she got home I had it recorded just by circumstance so I put on the
[02:26:56.880 --> 02:27:01.080]  recording of it and when I put on the recording I went frame by frame and I
[02:27:01.080 --> 02:27:05.760]  noticed what I first thought was just a pressure wave coming out of the reactor
[02:27:05.760 --> 02:27:10.400]  it appeared to be concentrated almost cylindrical in shape coming out to the
[02:27:10.400 --> 02:27:14.560]  left and when I went frame by frame inside that cylindrical kind of
[02:27:14.560 --> 02:27:18.080]  translucent what I thought was a pressure wave which it may be I don't
[02:27:18.080 --> 02:27:23.520]  know it's sort of like a cup shape like a diaphragm shape that's a little more
[02:27:23.520 --> 02:27:30.720]  opaque than the wave itself but the odd thing is as it rushes away from the
[02:27:30.720 --> 02:27:34.880]  reactor before it leaves the screen and if it was just a pressure wave it would
[02:27:34.880 --> 02:27:39.600]  just continue on and expand it disappears like somebody flipped a switch
[02:27:39.600 --> 02:27:44.440]  and so I was wondering I was gonna ask Nick baggage if perhaps that could have
[02:27:44.440 --> 02:27:48.000]  been something that's some type of beam or harp I know there are those that
[02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:53.000]  believe there was some kind of a secret weapon used like a lot of times a lot of
[02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:58.000]  times explosions cupcake you know how a cupcake goes up small and then kind of
[02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:02.720]  hangs over the sides a lot of times in pressure waves they go out and then the
[02:28:02.720 --> 02:28:07.280]  pressure turns back in and they'll actually suck in I mean I think if we
[02:28:07.280 --> 02:28:11.440]  start again just speculating that you know they're using space beams or
[02:28:11.440 --> 02:28:16.560]  whatever on it it looks like a classic explosion from hydrogen that then
[02:28:16.560 --> 02:28:21.600]  ejected the fuel rods stored on top of the mox mark one reactor thousands of
[02:28:21.600 --> 02:28:25.520]  feet into the air you can see that going on they now admit that happened now what
[02:28:25.520 --> 02:28:29.720]  was your comment about Nick baggage well reading between the lines not that he
[02:28:29.720 --> 02:28:33.400]  was trying to be deceptive at all you asked him his opinion because people
[02:28:33.400 --> 02:28:37.520]  keep calling you about harp and you've methodically told people look it's all
[02:28:37.520 --> 02:28:41.880]  speculation I can't really say which I appreciate but one of the things he
[02:28:41.880 --> 02:28:46.120]  mentioned in his sort of just commenting on it he used the word triggered and I
[02:28:46.120 --> 02:28:52.240]  wondered if with the supermoon so-called and the super flares from the sun the
[02:28:52.240 --> 02:28:55.240]  x flares no he said that that's what harps designed to do is that when they
[02:28:55.240 --> 02:29:00.840]  already have the the the conditions right for an earthquake that harp can then
[02:29:00.840 --> 02:29:04.920]  be that trigger that pushes it over the edge I don't think that was hidden what
[02:29:04.920 --> 02:29:08.480]  he said he said it straight out right no I'm saying he said it straight out I'm
[02:29:08.480 --> 02:29:11.920]  just saying he wasn't like saying I think it could be a trigger he just used
[02:29:11.920 --> 02:29:16.160]  the word trigger if you get a chance to look at that footage of the explosion
[02:29:16.160 --> 02:29:19.400]  again I appreciate what you said the cupcake effect but it looks really odd
[02:29:19.400 --> 02:29:23.320]  how it just completely blinks out of the picture and the fact that they edited
[02:29:23.320 --> 02:29:26.800]  the footage because that's the money shot not to be this respect well I know
[02:29:26.800 --> 02:29:31.080]  this I've caught Fox every day when I watch when they show Fukushima they
[02:29:31.080 --> 02:29:34.840]  show it file footage before the disaster and they're nice painted buildings
[02:29:34.840 --> 02:29:38.120]  people walking around and Americans are watching them thinking well that's no
[02:29:38.120 --> 02:29:42.200]  big deal meanwhile you see real photos and videos it's blown into bits with a
[02:29:42.200 --> 02:29:46.440]  bunch of shattered buildings the reactor buildings we'll be right back with
[02:29:46.440 --> 02:29:50.760]  Ray McGovern on what's happening in Libya with his expert take stay with us

[02:30:26.080 --> 02:30:29.800]  America's biggest mall owner general growth properties in fact Barron's

[02:32:15.120 --> 02:32:19.560]  its influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[02:32:19.560 --> 02:32:24.840]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay

[02:33:54.560 --> 02:33:59.120]  CIA with wide spectrum knowledge of what was happening geopolitically around the
[02:33:59.120 --> 02:34:03.240]  world he of course is very well known for confronting Rumsfeld and saying you
[02:34:03.240 --> 02:34:08.080]  said that the WMDs were in to Crete Rumsfeld said I did not say that and
[02:34:08.080 --> 02:34:12.000]  then he said well here's the evidence and then Rumsfeld got skewered in the
[02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:16.360]  media he also predicted a year before that Cheney would try to stage a Gulf
[02:34:16.360 --> 02:34:23.080]  of Tonkin event off the coast of Iran with fake attacks on aircraft carriers
[02:34:23.080 --> 02:34:28.560]  that indeed then did materialize it's an amazing source of information and he's
[02:34:28.560 --> 02:34:34.680]  also against all of these globalist wars Ray what is your bottom line take on
[02:34:34.680 --> 02:34:43.440]  what's happening in Libya on the report here out of West Point also being picked
[02:34:43.440 --> 02:34:52.160]  up by Asian Tribune that it is Al Qaeda that is being used to go after Gaddafi
[02:34:52.160 --> 02:34:55.960]  who's obviously not a good guy himself but here's the one in Telegraph the
[02:34:55.960 --> 02:34:59.600]  West and Al Qaeda on the same side statements of support by Libya's
[02:34:59.600 --> 02:35:03.640]  Revolution by Al Qaeda and leading Islamists have led to fears that military
[02:35:03.640 --> 02:35:07.960]  action by the West might be playing in the hands of ideological enemies we have
[02:35:07.960 --> 02:35:13.120]  the Fox News headline and more all-aloki exclusive head of Al Qaeda leader
[02:35:13.120 --> 02:35:17.280]  dined at the Pentagon just months that were 9-11 he's the Patsy Minder with his
[02:35:17.280 --> 02:35:21.760]  secret army what is Al Qaeda what's happening in the Middle East why is this
[02:35:21.760 --> 02:35:28.880]  now happening why did an F-15E crash over Benghazi why is giving there's so
[02:35:28.880 --> 02:35:33.880]  many questions Ray thanks for coming on with us well you're most welcome there
[02:35:33.880 --> 02:35:39.040]  are a lot of questions and it's supremely questionable as to whether we
[02:35:39.040 --> 02:35:44.560]  should be doing what we're doing in in Libya you know the the one thing that
[02:35:44.560 --> 02:35:51.800]  comes through very clearly is the fact that the hypocrisy that you what the US
[02:35:51.800 --> 02:35:58.480]  has demonstrated and dealing with these Arab governments knows no bounds take it
[02:35:58.480 --> 02:36:06.240]  just to go back a month or two and look at Egypt now when Mubarak started to
[02:36:06.240 --> 02:36:10.720]  have problems Hillary Clinton was very quick to say out it's a stable
[02:36:10.720 --> 02:36:14.760]  government you know they were our friends I've been at dinner with the
[02:36:14.760 --> 02:36:19.440]  robotics and a lot of business and that they were waiting to see what the army
[02:36:19.440 --> 02:36:26.800]  would do in Egypt okay now the army thank goodness did the right thing they
[02:36:26.800 --> 02:36:31.720]  didn't break up the demonstrators and the tide turned and as soon as the tide
[02:36:31.720 --> 02:36:36.320]  turned then we have this back and forth Obama saying well now we support
[02:36:36.320 --> 02:36:41.160]  democracy now maybe we're going to go so it's terribly cynical a way to see
[02:36:41.160 --> 02:36:44.800]  which way the wind was blowing and then all of a sudden they supported
[02:36:44.800 --> 02:36:53.040]  democracy now let's take a look at it was happening in Libya Libya were
[02:36:53.040 --> 02:37:00.680]  extensively intervening to protect civilians right now how do you protect
[02:37:00.680 --> 02:37:07.040]  civilians by bombing Tripoli by trying to hit Gaddafi's palaces it's a it's a
[02:37:07.040 --> 02:37:11.640]  very misguided adventure here there's no end in sight nor will there be for
[02:37:11.640 --> 02:37:17.840]  many many months meanwhile and this is the real the real bottom line here in
[02:37:17.840 --> 02:37:25.720]  places that really matter to us more than even Libya that is Bahrain and Yemen
[02:37:25.720 --> 02:37:32.200]  what are we doing there well we had not only waited for to see what the army
[02:37:32.200 --> 02:37:37.840]  would do in Bahrain for example but we encouraged not only the Bahrainian
[02:37:37.840 --> 02:37:42.920]  security police and army but also the Saudis to intervene in Bahrain and
[02:37:42.920 --> 02:37:48.560]  chewed up the demonstrators so this time we're on the side of the government
[02:37:48.560 --> 02:37:54.920]  why well very simple about rain the Ford's facilities that well they look
[02:37:54.920 --> 02:37:59.360]  like in San Diego on steroids I mean that's where the whole fifth fleet is
[02:37:59.360 --> 02:38:03.920]  that's the fleet that we have in the Persian Gulf the other end of the Persian
[02:38:03.920 --> 02:38:08.280]  Gulf is Yemen what are we doing there well the authorities are shooting up
[02:38:08.280 --> 02:38:12.560]  the people we're supporting the authorities why because Yemen is a very
[02:38:12.560 --> 02:38:18.920]  very strategic position and also the authorities allow our special forces to
[02:38:18.920 --> 02:38:23.840]  do whatever they want our drones to do anything that they want in Yemen so any
[02:38:23.840 --> 02:38:30.880]  Arab any Egyptian let's say any Syrian even any Jordanian Palestinian looking
[02:38:30.880 --> 02:38:36.160]  on with safety goodness what kind of a what kind of a policy is being waged out
[02:38:36.160 --> 02:38:42.120]  of Washington we have non-interference where it should be on the side of the
[02:38:42.120 --> 02:38:50.160]  democracy the Democrats and then we have interference with on behalf of whom we
[02:38:50.160 --> 02:38:55.440]  don't know on behalf of home Barack Obama's let himself be railroaded be
[02:38:55.440 --> 02:39:01.600]  pressured into intervening into Libya where there are enormous uncertainties
[02:39:01.600 --> 02:39:07.040]  we don't know how deeply the forces will be committed how long we don't even know
[02:39:07.040 --> 02:39:12.200]  the identities of many of the rebels on whose behalf we're intervening we don't
[02:39:12.200 --> 02:39:15.160]  know what the intervention is gonna likely accomplish we don't even know
[02:39:15.160 --> 02:39:20.760]  what intended to accomplish or how well and you know this is about as stupid as
[02:39:20.760 --> 02:39:25.560]  you can get now besides all that we have a constitutional process in this
[02:39:25.560 --> 02:39:31.840]  government what we're supposed to have a constitution that says that the power to
[02:39:31.840 --> 02:39:36.520]  make war is reserved to to the representatives of people in the
[02:39:36.520 --> 02:39:41.480]  Congress not the executive and yet what did Barack Obama do well he checked
[02:39:41.480 --> 02:39:45.800]  around with the UN he got support in the UN but did he get support in the
[02:39:45.800 --> 02:39:49.520]  Congress he didn't even check with the Congress he went off and did this all by
[02:39:49.520 --> 02:39:54.840]  himself that's unconstitutional and it's an impeachable offense so you know here
[02:39:54.840 --> 02:39:59.760]  we have a president acting very much in the tradition of the very recent
[02:39:59.760 --> 02:40:04.440]  tradition of his predecessor George W. Bush where the president pretty much
[02:40:04.440 --> 02:40:09.920]  should support or commit our forces to feckless adventures such as the one
[02:40:09.920 --> 02:40:14.680]  that's just begun Olivia mark my words this will have a no good end
[02:40:14.680 --> 02:40:21.080]  Ray McGovern top retired CIA analyst we're seeing gates come out and say
[02:40:21.080 --> 02:40:25.480]  that we're gonna cut airpower and strikes but then separately NATO and the
[02:40:25.480 --> 02:40:29.200]  Pentagon announced even though he's the supposed head of the Pentagon that
[02:40:29.200 --> 02:40:34.760]  they're intensifying the strikes in the same hour we see the Germans not being
[02:40:34.760 --> 02:40:40.520]  part of this the Turks not being part of it we see Medvedev and Putin fighting
[02:40:40.520 --> 02:40:46.520]  with each other Putin saying it's bad Medvedev rebuking him for calling it a
[02:40:46.520 --> 02:40:53.200]  foolish crusade I mean this this doesn't have you know the normal polished look of
[02:40:53.200 --> 02:40:58.520]  a new war it does seem to be very helter skelter very confused I mean is
[02:40:58.520 --> 02:41:03.280]  there's some method to the madness a and how do you from studying history see
[02:41:03.280 --> 02:41:08.360]  this ending what are the different scenarios well the only method in this
[02:41:08.360 --> 02:41:16.240]  madness so to speak would be the three-letter word oh I L Libby of course
[02:41:16.240 --> 02:41:21.800]  has lots of oil not only that but it's the kind of pure oil that requires very
[02:41:21.800 --> 02:41:28.560]  little refining and Western Europe is very much dependent on that oil now the
[02:41:28.560 --> 02:41:32.640]  rest of the world is not so much dependent but Western Europe is so here
[02:41:32.640 --> 02:41:38.560]  we have oil being a primary consideration as it is a primary consideration
[02:41:38.560 --> 02:41:44.600]  with how we're dealing with Bahrain and Yemen also because that oil 40% of the
[02:41:44.600 --> 02:41:49.800]  oil traded in international trade goes through the Strait of Hormuz and of
[02:41:49.800 --> 02:41:57.280]  course the fifth fleet is there to make sure that it does so in Libya we
[02:41:57.280 --> 02:42:03.920]  have a situation where the Gaddafi sits on top of all this oil he's only got I
[02:42:03.920 --> 02:42:10.120]  think four million people in the country so it should be not quite a piece of
[02:42:10.120 --> 02:42:14.920]  cake here or cakewalk as they said about Iraq but they're thinking well let's
[02:42:14.920 --> 02:42:18.760]  just get involved you know let's get involved and then we'll find out who
[02:42:18.760 --> 02:42:22.840]  these people are that we're protecting and maybe they're not a kite or maybe
[02:42:22.840 --> 02:42:28.200]  they are but anyhow we'll be in there and then we can work our will get Gaddafi
[02:42:28.200 --> 02:42:33.080]  out of there and make sure that the oil in Libya is safe for Western Europe
[02:42:33.080 --> 02:42:38.640]  that's pretty much it you know it's seldom so simple but when you put oil on
[02:42:38.640 --> 02:42:44.720]  top of your reasons for either intervening or not intervening and it
[02:42:44.720 --> 02:42:50.280]  all makes sense in a very very cynical kind of way because as you know the
[02:42:50.280 --> 02:42:55.440]  world is running out of oil and we've got a corner more than our share well
[02:42:55.440 --> 02:43:03.320]  expanding on that with Ray McGovern Ray looking at this how do you see it
[02:43:03.320 --> 02:43:07.760]  ending I mean I had two questions there but I mean how do you know looking into
[02:43:07.760 --> 02:43:12.200]  your crystal ball I know it's not a hundred percent but studying past history
[02:43:12.200 --> 02:43:17.760]  the region the bold I've never seen a president move this quick to just ignore
[02:43:17.760 --> 02:43:23.840]  Congress and and and let the other nine that voted for it basically control our
[02:43:23.840 --> 02:43:28.800]  foreign policy unprecedented there totally unconstitutional Republicans mom
[02:43:28.800 --> 02:43:34.440]  Democrats mom except for a few anti-war Democrats raising the Constitution and
[02:43:34.440 --> 02:43:39.560]  you you then have the unconstitutional I know there's an executive order against
[02:43:39.560 --> 02:43:43.960]  trying to assassinate people it's also international law they now basically
[02:43:43.960 --> 02:43:48.040]  admit that they did try to target Gaddafi with cruise missiles and bombs I
[02:43:48.040 --> 02:43:56.520]  mean this is quite an escalation well it is and I guess you mentioned the word
[02:43:56.520 --> 02:44:04.360]  bold to describe Obama's quick reaction here in my view there's a thin line
[02:44:04.360 --> 02:44:10.840]  between bold and irresponsible I go on the irresponsible side to characterize
[02:44:10.840 --> 02:44:15.480]  this ill-considered intervention so you're saying it's brash it's not
[02:44:15.480 --> 02:44:19.480]  thought through that's exactly right yeah I think we're really pretty sick much
[02:44:19.480 --> 02:44:24.760]  saying the same thing but but it's also irresponsible in the sense that doesn't
[02:44:24.760 --> 02:44:28.960]  make a lot of sense now here here he says that the objective of the operation
[02:44:28.960 --> 02:44:34.280]  that is Obama is limited to quote the protection the protection of citizens of
[02:44:34.280 --> 02:44:42.640]  civilians in Libya well so that objective is by nature unlimited in
[02:44:42.640 --> 02:44:48.440]  duration you know as long as civilians need to be protected in Libya then we
[02:44:48.440 --> 02:44:53.240]  have a quote the right under the Supreme under the person's statement to stay
[02:44:53.240 --> 02:45:00.840]  there the right interrupt Hillary also said and so was Obama in statements you
[02:45:00.840 --> 02:45:04.800]  will accept an international aid force that will obviously be armed NATO UN
[02:45:04.800 --> 02:45:10.280]  backed up by the Western powers or else well I mean that right there is saying
[02:45:10.280 --> 02:45:15.480]  you will accept an invasion a ground invasion and they've got the trip ships
[02:45:15.480 --> 02:45:23.280]  off the coast yeah it's you know the important thing here is the end game
[02:45:23.280 --> 02:45:28.120]  and the what's going to happen at the very end and that's really very much up
[02:45:28.120 --> 02:45:35.160]  for grabs Admiral Mullen apparently admitted on the Sunday TV shows that
[02:45:35.160 --> 02:45:40.400]  they could end up you know it's just the could end up with Gaddafi still in
[02:45:40.400 --> 02:45:46.920]  power and so if Gaddafi still around have we still accomplish the mission what
[02:45:46.920 --> 02:45:50.800]  is the mission accomplished there can be no declaration of a mission accomplished
[02:45:50.800 --> 02:45:57.320]  as long as our our objective is to protect the civilians in Libya the
[02:45:57.320 --> 02:46:02.360]  the reality on the ground is that we mean to get rid of Gaddafi we couldn't
[02:46:02.360 --> 02:46:06.520]  get the others security counsel to agree to that kind of language but we're gonna
[02:46:06.520 --> 02:46:11.040]  do it anyway and please please don't talk about international law but you
[02:46:11.040 --> 02:46:15.800]  don't you know with the Supreme with this soul remaining superpower in the
[02:46:15.800 --> 02:46:21.400]  world we don't have to worry about it the national law if the Europeans the
[02:46:21.400 --> 02:46:25.440]  Europeans will cooperate with us on this because they have been more at stake of
[02:46:25.440 --> 02:46:30.960]  it than we do because of the oil from Libya so it's a very cynical sort of
[02:46:30.960 --> 02:46:36.960]  set of circumstances and the long-term effects of this will be that any Arabs
[02:46:36.960 --> 02:46:44.600]  that have any conscience or or a sense of fairness will look at this and say see
[02:46:44.600 --> 02:46:50.040]  that's what we thought the Americans were like you can't trust them and by and
[02:46:50.040 --> 02:46:55.600]  by we're gonna get rid of those corrupt kings and Bahrain and Yemen and we're
[02:46:55.600 --> 02:46:59.720]  gonna have those places to our own and then we'll see what kind of what's the
[02:46:59.720 --> 02:47:04.280]  US will have in this part of the world it's a losing game I can't believe I
[02:47:04.280 --> 02:47:10.040]  can't believe that Obama is being so naive yeah totally going away from
[02:47:10.040 --> 02:47:15.200]  soft power at a time when the military is spread so thin what about the terror
[02:47:15.200 --> 02:47:20.360]  card we're seeing unbelievable hype starting last Friday that if Gaddafi was
[02:47:20.360 --> 02:47:23.720]  struck he's now been struck via the resolution and the bombardments
[02:47:23.720 --> 02:47:29.960]  intensifying that he will launch terror attacks in Western Europe and the US now
[02:47:29.960 --> 02:47:33.760]  a do you think Gaddafi would try to play a card like that even though he gave up
[02:47:33.760 --> 02:47:38.440]  most of his terror networks and B could this be the open door for a false flag
[02:47:38.440 --> 02:47:43.080]  to legitimize the war because people won't pay attention to the fact that it
[02:47:43.080 --> 02:47:49.160]  was started by the West so so will he actually carry out an attack or could the
[02:47:49.160 --> 02:47:54.200]  West stage something to legitimize a full invasion and the further crack down
[02:47:54.200 --> 02:48:00.600]  on liberty in the West well Alex that's always a possibility in these
[02:48:00.600 --> 02:48:05.040]  circumstances I don't think the West has its act together to the degree that
[02:48:05.040 --> 02:48:10.160]  they're able to do that just now they may end up doing that but what you point
[02:48:10.160 --> 02:48:17.760]  out very specifically is the ridiculous argument here that Gaddafi is a really
[02:48:17.760 --> 02:48:24.720]  bad guy because he might unleash terrorists on us that's backwards why
[02:48:24.720 --> 02:48:29.360]  would he unleash terrorists on us well because of what NATO or the NATO
[02:48:29.360 --> 02:48:33.920]  countries involved are doing to Libya so if you don't want to encourage
[02:48:33.920 --> 02:48:40.280]  terrorist acts against your country then maybe it wouldn't ought not to be flying
[02:48:40.280 --> 02:48:44.840]  sorties and bombing the country and trying to take out to the leader of the
[02:48:44.840 --> 02:48:50.680]  country it's it's a big Philip it's a big catalyst for terrorism what we're
[02:48:50.680 --> 02:48:55.920]  doing and when people say well why are they he is well you know if you want to
[02:48:55.920 --> 02:48:59.800]  buy the line that they had our democracy or our freedom well you know I got a
[02:48:59.800 --> 02:49:05.480]  bridge up in Manhattan that I'd really like to sell you with with Brooklyn
[02:49:05.480 --> 02:49:09.320]  you know but what they hate is our policy and our policy is determined
[02:49:09.320 --> 02:49:14.720]  first and foremost by our need for oil secondly but close a close second is our
[02:49:14.720 --> 02:49:19.520]  help need to do everything the Israelis tell us to do and thirdly to have the
[02:49:19.520 --> 02:49:24.520]  permanent military bases the fifth fleet being in boxing well that was my next
[02:49:24.520 --> 02:49:29.000]  question how is Israel involved in all this from your research well you know
[02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:34.040]  so far I think they've been looking on rather helplessly usually they're
[02:49:34.040 --> 02:49:39.720]  pretty much in command but things have moved so fast that that they have not
[02:49:39.720 --> 02:49:44.640]  been able to to keep up with it just yet the bottom line is that this is a
[02:49:44.640 --> 02:49:49.440]  disaster this whole thing is a disaster for Israel especially the Egypt
[02:49:49.440 --> 02:49:54.560]  democracy here well it reminds me of Bay of Pigs where you've got Western back
[02:49:54.560 --> 02:49:58.480]  rebels we know British SAS in there trying to wrangle them and control them
[02:49:58.480 --> 02:50:01.800]  and sometimes getting arrested because it shows they don't have full control
[02:50:01.800 --> 02:50:05.760]  these are al-Qaeda funded groups a lot of money Saudi Arabia with Western money
[02:50:05.760 --> 02:50:11.360]  that's admitted that some contingents are and with all of this happening it's
[02:50:11.360 --> 02:50:15.080]  like Bay of Pigs the rebels are there they're getting beat we've got to go in
[02:50:15.080 --> 02:50:19.040]  and help them I mean in that kind of what's happening yeah the only only
[02:50:19.040 --> 02:50:23.560]  uncertainty here and it's a big one is who are these rebels you know nobody
[02:50:23.560 --> 02:50:28.280]  seems to know and one thing you can bet you didn't mention Mossad the
[02:50:28.280 --> 02:50:33.320]  Israeli Secret Service you can bet that they're in there big time but and we'll
[02:50:33.320 --> 02:50:37.320]  do what they can to steer things in the right direction as far as their
[02:50:37.320 --> 02:50:40.520]  interests are concerned stay there Raymond governor I want to come back in a
[02:50:40.520 --> 02:50:44.120]  final segment and ask what their interests are what Mossad scurrying
[02:50:44.120 --> 02:50:48.680]  around in the area would do also this US aircraft shot down they claim we didn't
[02:50:48.680 --> 02:50:52.640]  have any regular aircraft over at the marines only using cruise missiles from
[02:50:52.640 --> 02:50:58.440]  bombardment I think F-15 E is a fighter bomber so we're gonna talk to Raymond
[02:50:58.440 --> 02:51:02.360]  government about that on the other side stay with us this message starts with a

[02:54:29.440 --> 02:54:35.080]  bankers have bankrupted us but more wars briefly Ray McGovern finishing up
[02:54:35.080 --> 02:54:44.960]  with Israeli policies what what what they see their interest being well it's
[02:54:44.960 --> 02:54:50.720]  not an exaggeration Alex to say that there's a completely new strategic
[02:54:50.720 --> 02:54:57.000]  situation facing Israel and that part of the world you see if you go back to the
[02:54:57.000 --> 02:55:01.800]  treaty the very important treaty that Egypt signed with Israel that was
[02:55:01.800 --> 02:55:06.320]  supposed to be the first step Jimmy Carter forced that through against great
[02:55:06.320 --> 02:55:09.680]  opposition on part of the Israelis and there was going to be even more
[02:55:09.680 --> 02:55:15.800]  opposition when he forced through phase two which was to address the grievances
[02:55:15.800 --> 02:55:21.800]  of the Palestinians and help them to set up a decent state now when he was non
[02:55:21.800 --> 02:55:26.840]  reelected the Israelis did everything they could to not reelect him then they
[02:55:26.840 --> 02:55:34.280]  they sabotaged any subsequent efforts and what Jimmy Carter started never
[02:55:34.280 --> 02:55:40.680]  got completed or never got continued what we had was a situation with a 32
[02:55:40.680 --> 02:55:46.560]  years Mubarak became not only the US Patsy in that part of the world but
[02:55:46.560 --> 02:55:52.000]  Israel's Patsy so lemon his number two or the head of his intelligence that he
[02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:57.480]  was called Israel's best friend okay so we have now now we have a very different
[02:55:57.480 --> 02:56:02.960]  situation now we have the prospect of a real democracy in Egypt was that mean
[02:56:02.960 --> 02:56:09.200]  well a real democracy is responsive to the sentiments to the thoughts and
[02:56:09.200 --> 02:56:13.840]  objectives of the people now how do the Egyptians feel about the Palestinians
[02:56:13.840 --> 02:56:18.040]  the ones in Gaza the ones in the West Bank who have been treated this way by
[02:56:18.040 --> 02:56:22.480]  the Israelis they feel very strongly about that they might start giving aid
[02:56:22.480 --> 02:56:27.560]  to Gaza that's exactly right and so whereas for 32 years the Israelis have
[02:56:27.560 --> 02:56:32.560]  been able to do what they wanted with respect to Syria Lebanon Gaza you name
[02:56:32.560 --> 02:56:37.120]  it now they have to worry about their southern and their western borders now
[02:56:37.120 --> 02:56:41.880]  it's no longer assumed that they can just do what they want in Gaza and that's a
[02:56:41.880 --> 02:56:46.600]  biggie and so the Israelis must be very very concerned about this we see in
[02:56:46.600 --> 02:56:50.620]  their statements that they are indeed and they'll do everything they can in
[02:56:50.620 --> 02:56:56.520]  Libya to try to force things into the kind of channel that will give them
[02:56:56.520 --> 02:57:01.280]  some leverage not only in Libya but in Egypt as well but it's gonna be an uphill
[02:57:01.280 --> 02:57:05.400]  struggle and they're gonna have to readjust their policy if they want to
[02:57:05.400 --> 02:57:11.120]  all right we're almost out of time in one minute what's your view on Fukushima
[02:57:11.120 --> 02:57:17.480]  well you know the I think the thing that really leaps out at me is the
[02:57:17.480 --> 02:57:23.840]  revelation in the WikiLeaks cables that the Japanese mothers were warned three
[02:57:23.840 --> 02:57:29.440]  four or five years ago that this might happen and nothing was done so what you
[02:57:29.440 --> 02:57:34.640]  have here are some people making a heck of a lot of money on these nuclear power
[02:57:34.640 --> 02:57:40.080]  stations and having very little regard for the welfare actually for the very
[02:57:40.080 --> 02:57:44.560]  lives of the people who have around it this is not atypical we see that in our
[02:57:44.560 --> 02:57:50.720]  own country even even now we see people proposing and suggesting that we go ahead
[02:57:50.720 --> 02:57:57.200]  with more power plants nuclear type you know it shows the brazen hubris yeah and
[02:57:57.200 --> 02:58:01.120]  it sort of means that we have to get out on the street and put our bodies into
[02:58:01.120 --> 02:58:05.560]  it here because nothing seems to work because the money the money is going to
[02:58:05.560 --> 02:58:08.880]  those people that are elected to representatives and they're not
[02:58:08.880 --> 02:58:12.160]  representing us well they're even covering up the severity of it that's
[02:58:12.160 --> 02:58:16.320]  admitted Ray McGovern thank you so much for spending time with us in adding your
