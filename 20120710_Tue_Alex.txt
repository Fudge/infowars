[00:00.000 --> 00:11.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.560 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:37.240]  Texas Alex Jones it is Tuesday my friends thank you so much for joining
[00:37.240 --> 00:48.520]  us it is Tuesday the 10th day of July 2012 coming up in the second hour we are
[00:48.520 --> 00:55.600]  going to be joined by Rosalind Peters who's done a lot of deep research into
[00:55.600 --> 01:01.080]  weather modification and I thought to get her on late last week when I saw the
[01:01.080 --> 01:07.840]  report out of the Hill newspaper in Apollo Tano on weird weather and climate
[01:07.840 --> 01:11.480]  change there's a pattern here and their answer is pay Al Gore and the global
[01:11.480 --> 01:16.160]  government a bunch of money and they will basically take care of everything
[01:16.160 --> 01:21.440]  for us then but meanwhile there is a massive sustained weather modification
[01:21.440 --> 01:26.120]  going on all over the world on record most of it's classified but the fact
[01:26.120 --> 01:30.440]  that it is going on is declassified just the details are classified so she's
[01:30.440 --> 01:34.560]  going to be joining us coming up in the second hour and we'll also open the
[01:34.560 --> 01:39.760]  phones up then we're gonna open the phones up during this hour as well I had
[01:39.760 --> 01:44.840]  been planning to go to Colorado to report on the road and check out the
[01:44.840 --> 01:49.240]  United States before the federal checkpoints completely shut it down and
[01:49.240 --> 01:52.880]  enemies of the global government like myself won't be able to travel anymore
[01:52.880 --> 01:56.360]  under the no travel system they're openly announcing I mean I'm not kidding
[01:56.360 --> 02:01.680]  that's where all this is that's where all this is going but then the little RV we
[02:01.680 --> 02:08.680]  have little as a joke turbo on the net sounds fancy but all those big buses
[02:08.680 --> 02:16.440]  have turbos on their diesel blew up as an old bus and so I didn't go but that's
[02:16.440 --> 02:19.480]  why Mike Adams was sitting in yesterday because I was gonna be on the road that
[02:19.480 --> 02:23.960]  day give me a chance to go all the way to Colorado but I want to thank him for
[02:23.960 --> 02:30.080]  sitting in and doing a fabulous job we are again going to be here for the next
[02:30.080 --> 02:34.760]  three hours today and more and more I realize that I'm just an information
[02:34.760 --> 02:39.320]  overload as I know you are as well I mean I just read all this news and
[02:39.320 --> 02:42.920]  information and track it and follow it and then want to talk about each little
[02:42.920 --> 02:47.600]  piece of it and then only get to a fraction of it and that's what's
[02:47.600 --> 02:53.640]  allowing tyranny to continue to spread its black wings over human society is
[02:53.640 --> 02:58.240]  because so much is happening and things are moving so quick and this
[02:58.240 --> 03:07.120]  foundation of corruption has been built to such a point that that this tyranny
[03:07.120 --> 03:14.800]  is just being poured out like a like a vial of acid onto us we've just got to
[03:14.800 --> 03:19.560]  be here pointing out to people why this is happening and really it hit me this
[03:19.560 --> 03:24.280]  morning again I made this point a lot but it really hit me that much stronger
[03:24.280 --> 03:31.520]  that this is premeditated this is an organized scientific takeover and
[03:31.520 --> 03:35.360]  that's why the system doesn't care if we all wake up that's why they don't care
[03:35.360 --> 03:40.480]  what we do they're going ahead with it and I just want people serving the
[03:40.480 --> 03:45.760]  system who are compartmentalized cogs to understand the future being developed
[03:45.760 --> 03:53.720]  the future being established is a future without about 99% of us now that's
[03:53.720 --> 03:58.160]  only in a few globalist documents that they plan to kill 99% most the
[03:58.160 --> 04:03.000]  documents are 80% or 90% and that's the debate they have but I just want to tell
[04:03.000 --> 04:07.920]  all the professors and camp followers and fellow travelers that go along with
[04:07.920 --> 04:13.760]  all this that you're gonna be killed as well now now people like dr. Pionka ut
[04:13.760 --> 04:19.960]  calls for a airborne Ebola to be released till 90% of us he says he
[04:19.960 --> 04:22.720]  understands that he and his family are gonna die and he's sad about it but it
[04:22.720 --> 04:29.000]  needs to happen and he turns out people out of the biology department who send
[04:29.000 --> 04:32.800]  me threatening emails and I go look them up and find out there you know over
[04:32.800 --> 04:36.680]  bioweapons development saying of course humans are a parasite you know we'd be
[04:36.680 --> 04:40.880]  better off without any humans and you know the doctor only wants to kill 90%
[04:40.880 --> 04:44.680]  we should probably kill everyone and then you go look the person up there in a
[04:44.680 --> 04:48.160]  white lab coat bragging about how they work in bioweapons development you know
[04:48.160 --> 04:52.560]  these are the type of big issues we're talking about we're gonna come back get
[04:52.560 --> 04:58.360]  into all of it it's a very important TSA is now savagely attacking and death

[06:11.400 --> 06:15.440]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[06:15.440 --> 06:19.320]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[06:19.320 --> 06:23.600]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[06:23.600 --> 06:27.760]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[06:27.760 --> 06:32.080]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[06:32.080 --> 06:35.800]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number

[08:05.940 --> 08:13.320]  information war continues it's alex jones and the GCN radio network
[08:21.520 --> 08:28.720]  it is Tuesday my friends the 10th day of July 2012 I am your host alex jones
[08:28.720 --> 08:33.120]  and we are going to be here for the next three hours today we're going to take a
[08:33.120 --> 08:39.480]  deep look at ongoing declassified weather modification going on globally and
[08:39.480 --> 08:45.180]  being used as weather weapons against populations across the world with
[08:45.180 --> 08:50.360]  Rosalind Peterson of California Skywatch always informative and it ties
[08:50.360 --> 08:55.800]  into the drones ties into massive whale and other marine mammal beaching all
[08:55.800 --> 09:02.600]  over the world with the new super high-power sonar systems as well very
[09:02.600 --> 09:09.840]  important information coming up you know where do you start I've probably got
[09:09.840 --> 09:13.920]  200 articles here in front of me each one more insane in the last I just want
[09:13.920 --> 09:17.480]  to get this out here right now and everybody listening because they have a
[09:17.480 --> 09:21.760]  lot of new listeners every day the tune in but also longtime listeners because
[09:21.760 --> 09:28.680]  this hit me right between the eyes psychologically of this morning it just
[09:28.680 --> 09:33.080]  really hit me that we've been very accurate about our analysis of the
[09:33.080 --> 09:38.000]  world government and their end game and that it is totally premeditated
[09:38.000 --> 09:43.200]  everything you see unfolding right now at a global level by the banking crime
[09:43.200 --> 09:49.240]  syndicates and that they are waging war against society and want to implode the
[09:49.240 --> 09:53.720]  world economy and that is literally in thousands of their statements and
[09:53.720 --> 09:58.200]  documents but when you consciously understand that and you consciously
[09:58.200 --> 10:03.880]  realize that all of the big pharma were set up by eugenicist in the last 150
[10:03.880 --> 10:09.120]  years the people that created Hitler just giving an idea who they are and that
[10:09.120 --> 10:15.800]  that that they designed the new drugs to hurt you and kill you as part of a
[10:15.800 --> 10:22.280]  system to profit while they get rid of you and that they block good inexpensive
[10:22.280 --> 10:30.640]  drugs from being legalized and that it is premeditated complete evil I was just
[10:30.640 --> 10:36.080]  thinking about this in the last four days it's come out that the drug company
[10:36.080 --> 10:42.720]  Glaxo Smith Klein knowingly put out an asthma drug that did not help you and in
[10:42.720 --> 10:47.880]  fact made asthma worse and is linked to killing a bunch of people and they've
[10:47.880 --> 10:58.040]  made 7.8 billion in one year off of it 13.4 billion globally and they're
[10:58.040 --> 11:03.360]  estimated to make even more than that in the future 13.4 bill in just
[11:03.360 --> 11:08.200]  international sales by 2020 but they had blockbuster cells of 7.8 billion in
[11:08.200 --> 11:17.240]  2010 and that they knew it was a death sentence now in the 60s they said stop
[11:17.240 --> 11:22.160]  giving oral polio vaccine to people and that it was the law it had to be
[11:22.160 --> 11:26.840]  destroyed it's still given in the United States
[11:29.080 --> 11:35.280]  see that's what's incredible it is in the Indian and African and European and
[11:35.280 --> 11:44.760]  even US medical publications that last year alone 47,500 plus children were
[11:44.760 --> 11:50.560]  paralyzed and many of them died we're talking about kids dying over a few
[11:50.560 --> 11:54.560]  weeks as a virus eats their nerves and then not being able to breathe and
[11:54.560 --> 12:02.240]  dying doesn't feel too hot under the UN Bill and Melinda Gates polio vaccine
[12:02.240 --> 12:07.400]  program no one's gonna save them no one's gonna help them and I get to go
[12:07.400 --> 12:10.600]  sit in a restaurant here stay with my kids and watch cops strut around in
[12:10.600 --> 12:16.080]  there as they eat bugging their eyes out at me fine I mean it's a joke it's a
[12:16.080 --> 12:23.200]  joke it's a joke the country in the world is run by psychopath killers
[12:23.200 --> 12:28.680]  creepy vicious murderous nerds like Bill Gates and his wife that I have to sit
[12:28.680 --> 12:35.640]  there and look at knowing full well what they're doing and then I get to see
[12:35.640 --> 12:39.920]  all the little bureaucratic state in pecking and micromanaging and throwing
[12:39.920 --> 12:45.320]  the book at the public and all of this while I know I don't think I know in
[12:45.320 --> 12:51.360]  a quadruplicate triplicate on top of itself that they're murdering us and no
[12:51.360 --> 12:55.040]  understanding against them and it's just getting more and more insane because
[12:55.040 --> 13:03.400]  the average person listening to this is a new listener a cannot believe it's
[13:03.400 --> 13:06.560]  really this bad and be even if they check it out and find out it's true what
[13:06.560 --> 13:12.520]  do you do what do you do well I guess you just die I mean we just watch society
[13:12.520 --> 13:16.080]  slowly dying it becomes normal to have you know half your family with cancer
[13:16.080 --> 13:19.600]  and you know but brain damage and everybody just starts dying and that's
[13:19.600 --> 13:27.120]  the way it is and everybody goes out and has a little 10k jog for all the
[13:27.120 --> 13:30.800]  neurological disorders of the breast cancer up 2,000 plus percent or the
[13:30.800 --> 13:35.720]  pediatric cancers yeah because I've got all this news in front of me but does
[13:35.720 --> 13:38.720]  any of it even matter
[13:40.040 --> 13:44.080]  but they had a famous musician yesterday in fact I had at the stack but you guys
[13:44.080 --> 13:50.640]  print it for me again because I can't find it get groped and there was a big
[13:50.640 --> 13:55.520]  death conference in Kentucky and they were flying back out wearing their
[13:55.520 --> 14:01.040]  shirts from the death conference you're unable to hear and the TSA started
[14:01.040 --> 14:04.240]  making fun of them calling them names and stealing stuff out of their bags in
[14:04.240 --> 14:07.920]  front of them and then eating their candy out of one guy's bag and laughing
[14:07.920 --> 14:12.240]  at them and people like well that's an anomaly no it's not that's what's meant
[14:12.240 --> 14:16.840]  to happen that's what tyranny looks like that's what we're going to go into
[14:16.840 --> 14:21.360]  that's that's that's who the home inspectors are in Australia now exact
[14:21.360 --> 14:25.560]  type goons doing the same stuff this is what it's like to be a slave
[14:25.560 --> 14:30.040]  everybody wants to be a slave well you're gonna get to be one on your way to
[14:30.040 --> 14:42.200]  being soft killed so they implemented a market program back in 2010 to push a
[14:42.200 --> 14:46.640]  direct to consumer kind of like in the 80s and 81 they mailed out Prozac in
[14:46.640 --> 14:51.760]  samples in the mail a psychotropic hallucinogen based chemical weapon that
[14:51.760 --> 14:57.160]  brain damages you and they mailed out samples in the mail oh but the police are
[14:57.160 --> 15:00.400]  gonna have a checkpoint later today in your town to just make sure you don't
[15:00.400 --> 15:08.360]  have any drugs and you're supposed to oh yes sir yes sir I I watched these cops
[15:08.360 --> 15:13.200]  yesterday when the waiter came over and and thanked him and said oh surge they
[15:13.200 --> 15:16.840]  just ignored them like this is the citizen it's a piece of trash cops didn't
[15:16.840 --> 15:20.000]  even act like they existed as they're sitting there eating in like an hour-long
[15:20.000 --> 15:27.800]  lunch and then I watch as they got up and ambled around I watch as a family was
[15:27.800 --> 15:32.480]  walking up and they all fearfully waited for the police to go out the door
[15:32.480 --> 15:36.720]  first and the dad that people their kids were shaking in fear I mean get me out
[15:36.720 --> 15:40.640]  of this country just just get me out of here it's the whole world though I could
[15:40.640 --> 15:44.440]  go to third-world countries I could go to Mexico or North Korea and you know
[15:44.440 --> 15:49.120]  watch people and cops come stand up you know scared up against the wall just
[15:49.120 --> 15:55.320]  just just just I don't even hate those police by the way I just know we're
[15:55.320 --> 16:04.120]  circling the drain just everywhere I go I see the signs of it and it tears my
[16:04.120 --> 16:09.120]  guts out I mean I this is coming out every day or two now and and by the way
[16:09.120 --> 16:18.200]  blacksmith client admits that they knew their asthma drug add there actually
[16:18.200 --> 16:24.320]  caused asthma and killed people including adrenal insufficiency worsening of
[16:24.320 --> 16:30.080]  asthma and death well I mean they knew that the Gardasil shot was killing
[16:30.080 --> 16:34.800]  people didn't protect you from cervical cancer set it on the insert they knew
[16:34.800 --> 16:38.680]  that the H1N1 was killing people they knew that they were given the small
[16:38.680 --> 16:44.160] pox and anthrax shots the troops it killed thousands they know it's not for a
[16:44.160 --> 16:48.280]  greater good though like well statistically this makes it better they spread
[16:48.280 --> 16:54.200]  it that's why polio is now spreading in Africa Central Asia Pakistan subcontinent
[16:54.200 --> 16:59.840]  India became it's admitted they don't even deny they're causing it and then
[16:59.840 --> 17:03.240]  now when they have outbreaks and it paralyzes people they go well we don't
[17:03.240 --> 17:09.840]  call it polio but it is polio and it's a weaponized polio I mean I was thinking
[17:09.840 --> 17:14.720]  about knowingly Bill Gates went over there to inject but also give him oral
[17:14.720 --> 17:18.200]  you can pull up Bill Gates gives children polio vaccine and he gets this
[17:18.200 --> 17:20.880]  psycho look on his face while he's giving them a shot or put it in their
[17:20.880 --> 17:24.840]  mouth and I just thought my god how do you do that well what I mean and he's
[17:24.840 --> 17:28.960]  you know dad's had a Planned Parenthood global issue Genesis he's on record

[26:08.720 --> 26:14.560]  the whole thing is basically an arrest scenario
[26:14.560 --> 26:18.560]  that's what it is the whole thing is again acclimating and we also have a
[26:18.560 --> 26:21.360]  video and curse you into a blurb on it right now
[26:21.360 --> 26:25.200]  up at info wars.com and prisonpunna.com of the tsa

[26:32.800 --> 26:36.640]  guns are banned so the criminals all move there because they don't follow the law
[26:36.640 --> 26:41.600]  to feed on citizens that do and no no no they're just searching people

[27:02.880 --> 27:05.760]  confirmed as well they do hire criminals that that's that's the
[27:05.760 --> 27:08.720]  mainstream news and when they hire them it's all a big
[27:08.720 --> 27:12.720]  joke now it's like oh she's good looking watch this if you're into women
[27:12.720 --> 27:18.320]  or if the guy's into men it's watch this and uh if it's a movie star women come

[27:44.080 --> 27:47.280]  that's exactly what it's like to show up at your business and say
[27:47.280 --> 27:50.240]  uh you can still work here and get a small paycheck if you want but the state
[27:50.240 --> 27:53.920]  owns it now and we're uh you know putting these bureaucrats families in
[27:53.920 --> 27:58.240]  here to run this and by the way we'll arrest you if you
[27:58.240 --> 28:01.600]  don't keep this running for us and just basically give us the money
[28:01.600 --> 28:04.960]  it's just like when the mafia would show up at your grocery store your cleaners
[28:04.960 --> 28:08.640]  or wherever you know 60 70 80 100 years ago in new york or someplace
[28:08.640 --> 28:11.920]  or new jersey places where folks would put up with it culturally
[28:11.920 --> 28:15.840]  and they'd come to him and say you're gonna pay me 20 percent of everything
[28:15.840 --> 28:19.040]  you make and to make sure you do you're gonna hire my buddy here
[28:19.040 --> 28:22.320]  he's not gonna do any work but he's gonna sit behind the counter and he's gonna
[28:22.320 --> 28:25.120]  watch everything you're doing you're gonna pay him too and then a few months
[28:25.120 --> 28:28.720]  later if you put up with that they go oh you're gonna hire some more people
[28:28.720 --> 28:32.240]  and then you know what we're gonna kill your daughter and kill your wife
[28:32.240 --> 28:35.440]  if you don't go sign some debts with the bank
[28:35.440 --> 28:40.000]  and give us the money because you know what we've learned you'll put up with
[28:40.000 --> 28:42.400]  this and see that's what government's doing now
[28:42.400 --> 28:46.320]  it's saying uh we're going to have the government enforce
[28:46.320 --> 28:49.600]  the IRS on you
[28:50.160 --> 28:52.880]  and they're gonna collect money and pay it to foreign banks and they're gonna
[28:52.880 --> 28:56.720]  enforce the health care on you and we're gonna cut the care you get
[28:56.720 --> 28:59.840]  as well uh written by the insurance companies

[33:51.920 --> 33:56.160]  deafies steal his candy again the man was part of a conference of
[33:56.160 --> 33:59.040]  deaf folks hearing impaired coming back so they knew they were
[33:59.040 --> 34:03.280]  with their conference t shirts and because they were signing
[34:03.280 --> 34:08.960]  they can read obviously lips and blogger for tea and theater was traveling
[34:08.960 --> 34:11.280]  back home having attended a week-long conference
[34:11.280 --> 34:16.480]  for deaf people in louisville his t-shirt part of a promotional material for
[34:16.480 --> 34:19.440]  the conference clearly identified him as being deaf as soon as he approached
[34:19.440 --> 34:22.800]  airport security then i'll see big government is what's
[34:22.800 --> 34:28.000]  insecure the tsa officers they're not officers began laughing at the man
[34:28.000 --> 34:31.680]  welcome in north korea they went through my bag for no reason and found a couple
[34:31.680 --> 34:35.520]  of bags of candy i brought i was told i was
[34:35.520 --> 34:40.400]  wasn't allowed to fly with that i've flown with food before
[34:40.400 --> 34:46.320]  they were even sealed and it went on you don't make excuses slave
[34:46.320 --> 34:49.680]  i was then asked if i would like to donate the candy to the usl
[34:49.680 --> 34:53.440]  for the trips since i know the airport there has a
[34:53.440 --> 34:58.960]  international guard base i figured it would go to the soldiers
[34:58.960 --> 35:02.720]  so he said sure oh well the fun see now you
[35:02.720 --> 35:05.280]  that they were testing you to see if they could have some fun
[35:05.280 --> 35:09.840]  because cowards cowards want to make sure you're a cowards they can have some
[35:09.840 --> 35:12.880]  safe fun things would have gotten real loud at
[35:12.880 --> 35:17.040]  that point with me the guards as i was getting scanned
[35:17.040 --> 35:21.440]  that's right radiated and getting your naked body scan why not do more started
[35:21.440 --> 35:25.280]  eating the candy they just told me was for the soldiers in front of me
[35:25.280 --> 35:29.920]  well that's the whole point still laughing at me very clearly now
[35:29.920 --> 35:33.760]  one of them asked why they were laughing
[35:33.760 --> 35:37.280]  and one of them came up to me pointed at my shirt and laughed at me and said
[35:37.280 --> 35:43.120]  effing deathy the louisville tsa called me a effing deathy and laughed at me
[35:43.120 --> 35:47.040]  because i was deaf and they and they expected
[35:47.040 --> 35:52.000]  wouldn't say anything back or wouldn't hear them make no bones about it
[35:52.000 --> 35:57.200]  she was facing me and i read her lips there was no mistake
[35:57.200 --> 36:01.120]  i would later find out that they had called at least four other individuals
[36:01.120 --> 36:04.880]  the same thing yeah you get a bunch of deaf folks who on average
[36:04.880 --> 36:09.680]  and higher IQs than average folks you idiot tsa maggots
[36:09.680 --> 36:16.000]  and then i mean this is the essence of north korea the essence of of
[36:16.000 --> 36:20.160]  mexican corruption they wouldn't even act like this in mexico by the way
[36:20.160 --> 36:26.000]  the the the essence of everything disgusting the essence of
[36:26.000 --> 36:29.440]  nazi germany tyranny russian communist tyranny
[36:29.440 --> 36:32.320]  i mean this is it
[36:32.560 --> 36:37.600]  and i'm just amazed by how trashy this country's gotten in many sectors
[36:37.600 --> 36:41.200]  and how those of us that are wholesome and aren't degenerate
[36:41.200 --> 36:48.400]  we're the enemy and it just goes on with the hiring of criminals
[36:48.400 --> 36:52.480]  dumping over jars on dumping them out then laughing at people with their
[36:52.480 --> 36:57.120]  families ashes uh they're not gonna stop
[36:57.120 --> 37:01.600]  this is the fun you know i told you what happened probably
[37:01.600 --> 37:07.120]  it was in 2006 and i was flying back from los angeles
[37:07.120 --> 37:10.560]  and again i just been at the hotel just shower just put
[37:10.560 --> 37:16.560]  fresh sock shoes on because if anything i've got good hygiene
[37:16.560 --> 37:20.080]  and i'm driving through and they say take your shoes off i'm going through
[37:20.080 --> 37:22.480]  walking through all the athletes foot all of it talk about a
[37:22.480 --> 37:25.520]  sanat sanitization problem talk about a
[37:25.520 --> 37:29.200]  biohazard and these guys start laughing at me going
[37:29.200 --> 37:34.000]  oh look at mr stinky feet and it was so infantile so childlike
[37:34.000 --> 37:39.040]  i kind of halfway smiled at the guys and they looked at me and started being
[37:39.040 --> 37:42.880]  real aggressive going mr stinky feet oh he doesn't like a sand we have stinky
[37:42.880 --> 37:46.000]  feet and i didn't even really get mad i was
[37:46.000 --> 37:50.880]  shocked by how pathetic and weak and and and warm like these people were
[37:50.880 --> 37:54.080]  and i was like wow
[37:54.640 --> 37:58.080]  i was wow
[37:58.720 --> 38:02.880]  and then they looked away and walked off because i guess
[38:02.880 --> 38:06.320]  they wanted me to get upset and feel humiliated that would feed their
[38:06.320 --> 38:09.520]  vampiric power it wasn't that it was more
[38:09.520 --> 38:15.600]  how pathetic they were and more shock and they read that and scurried off but
[38:15.600 --> 38:18.480]  imagine they've got those little kids in there every day
[38:18.480 --> 38:21.840]  you've seen the videos the photos they get scared they yell at the parents
[38:21.840 --> 38:24.560]  stand back grab the two three-year-old cry and drag them off
[38:24.560 --> 38:28.720]  there's a hardcore psychic vampire feeding going on right there well that
[38:28.720 --> 38:33.920]  kid scared being a pedo trained by the pedo
[38:33.920 --> 38:38.000]  enforcers i mean it's a pedo feeding frenzy
[38:38.000 --> 38:41.280]  and again the humiliations are just going to get worse i mean this is the
[38:41.280 --> 38:44.640]  bottom falling out because hey 50 plus million babies that
[38:44.640 --> 38:48.320]  have been chopped up nobody was there to save them nobody was there to say they
[38:48.320 --> 38:52.560]  were a human so they're going to drag your your four-year-old off and molest them
[38:52.560 --> 38:55.360]  they're going to grab your wife's breasts they're going to put you in a
[38:55.360 --> 38:57.680]  microwave oven they're going to steal your candy
[38:57.680 --> 39:01.520]  they're going to take a two ounce bottle of shampoo when i was in billings
[39:01.520 --> 39:06.240]  and start screaming at women who kept the shampoos saying this is illegal
[39:06.240 --> 39:09.600]  and all this stuff when it was actually what was it three or four ounces
[39:09.600 --> 39:16.560]  and they knew full well it was about sacks of puss that live to dominate and
[39:16.560 --> 39:22.880]  bully people and that's hard work bullying people
[39:25.360 --> 39:31.680]  it's hard work doing that only the lowest life forms enjoy things like that
[39:31.680 --> 39:36.720]  and i now digress it's just that this is only a small manifestation you're
[39:36.720 --> 39:41.360]  going to say children aren't children in the womb well you know what then
[39:41.440 --> 39:45.600]  why not kill children up to age three guys type it in bioethicist journal calls
[39:45.600 --> 39:49.280]  for killing children up to age three who are even healthy kill the old you're
[39:49.280 --> 39:52.240]  now hearing it you're now hearing them go well yeah you're not going to get eye
[39:52.240 --> 39:56.160]  surgery when you're over 60 you don't deserve that it's we all
[39:56.160 --> 40:00.480]  pay into it those old dirty bad people the time magazine was telling us about
[40:00.480 --> 40:03.760]  two weeks ago i'm going to take care of them get rid of them
[40:03.760 --> 40:07.200]  see it's a predatory economy where it implodes now
[40:07.200 --> 40:11.760]  it isn't a win-win where the economy grows that's their enemy that's freedom
[40:11.760 --> 40:17.120]  they're getting rid of that this is the new economy this is the new america
[40:17.120 --> 40:21.840]  where four cops are eating in a restaurant
[40:22.560 --> 40:28.560]  and i watched them while i sat there for an hour eating with my children
[40:28.560 --> 40:32.240]  and they didn't talk to the waiter when the waiter came over and groveled to them
[40:32.240 --> 40:37.520]  and called them sir sir sir in fear this country is so gone i mean wow
[40:37.520 --> 40:43.120]  whoa i mean just oh so pathetic uh yeah there's
[40:43.120 --> 40:46.480]  daughters should have the right to kill unwanted disabled babies at birth as
[40:46.480 --> 40:49.520]  they are not a real person claims former oxford academic
[40:49.520 --> 40:53.120]  yeah that's something else this is a new bioethics journal
[40:53.120 --> 40:58.960]  calls for killing children up to age three government funded
[40:58.960 --> 41:01.600]  and again i'm not even bashing the police they were in their own world
[41:01.600 --> 41:04.560]  they're so used to it they think it's normal maybe they think they're royalty
[41:04.560 --> 41:07.520]  queen elizabeth doesn't think it's abnormal people to fall down before
[41:07.520 --> 41:11.120]  and the cops didn't and then i watched when the cops got up
[41:11.120 --> 41:15.840]  there was a family going out the door and it wasn't done out of respect
[41:15.840 --> 41:20.880]  it was done out of fear they waited and the three cops went in front of the
[41:20.880 --> 41:24.400]  family and the one cop in the at the end felt
[41:24.400 --> 41:28.160]  embarrassed and turned and went no no you go
[41:28.160 --> 41:35.680]  see in that little act of being humble is the hope of our civilization
[41:35.680 --> 41:39.280]  the one cop when the family sit there with fear
[41:39.280 --> 41:43.360]  up against the wall good-looking family
[41:43.600 --> 41:47.040]  the three cops well yeah we're god walked by and the one at the end
[41:47.040 --> 41:50.880]  looked at him and there was this moment and you could tell he saw the fear
[41:50.880 --> 41:54.400]  and he smiled at him and waved him forward i mean that's how
[41:54.400 --> 41:58.560]  land of the free home of the brave where you see cops in a restaurant walking
[41:58.560 --> 42:03.200]  across the thing 10 15 feet behind you and you're so scared of them
[42:03.200 --> 42:07.200]  you're so scared of them that you stand up against the wall
[42:07.200 --> 42:13.040]  that's what the tsa and all of this is about well not me
[42:19.120 --> 42:23.040]  if there was some new continent and it didn't even have electricity
[42:23.040 --> 42:26.560]  i would go there now if it was promised that the globalist wouldn't
[42:26.560 --> 42:28.720]  invade it wouldn't be messed with it if i had to go
[42:28.720 --> 42:33.520]  hand dig wells and i had to go live in the middle of the desert
[42:33.520 --> 42:36.560]  i would leave i will tell you now but here's the deal
[42:36.560 --> 42:42.320]  there is nowhere to go nowhere to run and let me tell you
[42:42.320 --> 42:44.960]  you want to know why we've gotten to this point you got to look in the mirror
[42:44.960 --> 42:48.480]  here's the toll free number to join us going to give the number out now
[42:48.480 --> 42:58.880]  first time callers 800-25-99231 800-25-99231 and we will get you up and on
[42:58.880 --> 43:04.400]  the air 800-25-99231
[43:07.680 --> 43:11.360]  you know i was reading it's not just two big
[43:11.360 --> 43:14.960]  pharma companies there's actually three who've just been
[43:14.960 --> 43:19.600]  caught and are paying less than 10% of the money they made to the government
[43:19.600 --> 43:23.520]  so it's really a license to kill for knowingly killing people
[43:23.520 --> 43:26.560]  with vaccines they knew were going to kill them and they knew
[43:26.560 --> 43:32.640]  actually gave them the measles and other pathogens
[43:32.640 --> 43:36.160]  where big companies knew drugs were killing people
[43:36.160 --> 43:42.160]  and put it on the market they know you see instead of saying oh don't give it
[43:42.160 --> 43:45.200]  to a pregnant woman as they've done for 67 to years of vaccines
[43:45.200 --> 43:49.200]  knowing it causes an autoimmune response and can either brain damage
[43:49.200 --> 43:53.520]  the children or cause a miscarriage instead they just three and a half
[43:53.520 --> 43:57.040]  years ago started saying pregnant women especially
[43:57.040 --> 44:00.560]  no danger and had it taken off the inserts
[44:00.560 --> 44:04.320]  i mean wow man i mean that is cold blooded
[44:04.320 --> 44:08.800]  you got a happy six month pregnant woman and the and the dad's excited and
[44:08.800 --> 44:11.520]  they're getting their buying you know stuff getting the crib ready
[44:11.520 --> 44:15.280]  and then you have a horrible miscarriage and these people just lick it up like a
[44:15.280 --> 44:18.320]  dog eating vomit
[44:19.600 --> 44:24.880]  my guts are torn out by this because i understand ladies and gentlemen i they
[44:24.880 --> 44:27.440]  are hurting innocents everywhere there are
[44:27.440 --> 44:31.280]  hospital beds of soft killed children paralyzed
[44:31.280 --> 44:34.640]  in horrible pain with bed sores all over them
[44:34.640 --> 44:38.240]  just later to be given hospice and to be killed that's what india does
[44:38.240 --> 44:44.880]  is they're so poor because the un came and gave them the vaccine last year
[44:44.880 --> 44:49.280]  now the 47 plus thousand thousands and thousands and thousands of died thousands
[44:49.280 --> 44:52.400]  more are dying and they're over there right now nobody's helping them
[44:52.400 --> 44:56.080]  they're in open air with bugs crawling on them if they haven't been euthanized
[44:56.080 --> 44:59.120]  yet if they can hold on if they haven't been given opium yet till they die at
[44:59.120 --> 45:03.920]  the hospice and it's just funny to america america the average american
[45:03.920 --> 45:07.920]  listening probably thinks this is cute i've talked to them it's fun it's
[45:07.920 --> 45:13.120]  neat well it's all going to happen to us you need to understand that
[45:13.120 --> 45:16.640]  and i shake with the judgment this country's coming under even if you're
[45:16.640 --> 45:19.760]  a nihilist and don't believe in god you need to know when you let this type of
[45:19.760 --> 45:22.640]  stuff go on it's going to come back on you
[45:22.640 --> 45:28.160]  and they've announced the new executive order as i told you years ago
[45:28.160 --> 45:31.200]  because they already had other executive orders and i could see the
[45:31.200 --> 45:35.120]  the federal regulations that they're going to be able to take over all
[45:35.120 --> 45:38.800]  communications radio tv internet cell phones and
[45:38.800 --> 45:41.040]  that they're going to start testing it more and more with government
[45:41.040 --> 45:43.680]  announcements fact it's already begun and they say
[45:43.680 --> 45:49.680]  it's a selective kill switch uh they're already testing it
[45:49.680 --> 45:54.080]  it's just armored pill boxes hundreds of millions of rounds
[45:54.080 --> 45:58.640]  hollow points for us checkpoints swat teams everywhere
[45:58.640 --> 46:02.400]  taking our money and arming to the teeth against us drones
[46:02.400 --> 46:07.040]  armored vehicles tanks citizen spy forces
[46:07.040 --> 46:11.040]  the cable man the telephone person the maid service
[46:11.040 --> 46:14.960]  everyone is trained to spy on you when you go rent a car they ask you 20
[46:14.960 --> 46:17.840]  questions literally more than 20 spying on you
[46:17.840 --> 46:21.120]  hotels there's everybody's a secret agent everybody knows how to watch each
[46:21.120 --> 46:25.440]  other but the crook foreign banks that took over
[46:25.440 --> 46:29.440]  nobody's watching the government oh it's it's it's totally secret behind
[46:29.440 --> 46:33.120]  national security she thinks they're backwards government's
[46:33.120 --> 46:36.240]  supposed to be transparent and then we're supposed to be secret
[46:36.240 --> 46:40.560]  because we're individuals and we don't have the power of the mega state
[46:40.560 --> 46:48.960]  so we're supposed to have the secrecy they're supposed to have none of it
[46:49.040 --> 46:51.920]  i've got a lot of economic news that we're going to get to after our guest
[46:51.920 --> 46:55.520]  leaves us and after calls uh google of course it came out months
[46:55.520 --> 47:01.360]  ago what we told you years ago for the nsa is driving around in vehicles grabbing
[47:01.360 --> 47:04.800]  your wireless transmissions and cracking codes and
[47:04.800 --> 47:08.240]  downloading your computer and ignoring privacy settings and going
[47:08.240 --> 47:10.880]  through and downloading the contents of your computer
[47:10.880 --> 47:15.200]  loading trojans on your computer uh and watching you and listening to you with
[47:15.200 --> 47:18.480]  ai computers that go to the national security agency google
[47:18.480 --> 47:26.080]  is the nsa and that's the daily mail google find 25.5 mil for ignoring
[47:26.080 --> 47:29.280]  customer privacy settings the largest penalty ever imposed
[47:29.280 --> 47:34.240]  by us federal trade commission that'd be like if i got caught

[48:55.680 --> 48:59.680]  and killing them and when i saw this this weekend i wasn't on yesterday
[48:59.680 --> 49:03.520]  when i saw this sunday night i said didn't that just happen
[49:03.520 --> 49:07.200]  and i went and looked it up and found more than one other case

[49:12.080 --> 49:15.840]  boy killing and that happened this weekend associated press

[49:43.760 --> 49:47.280]  investigated connections between these two groups of people
[49:47.280 --> 49:51.600]  uh and because statistically that's what this is

[49:54.960 --> 49:59.360]  and in one month it happens to small children in the u.s
[49:59.360 --> 50:04.000]  at cemeteries to small children

[54:13.920 --> 54:17.760]  but Ernest Borgnein was a listener of this radio show
[54:19.040 --> 54:25.840]  but did not want to come on the show and it was about five years ago I talked to Ernest Borgnein
[54:25.840 --> 54:31.920]  it was just interesting factoid that when he was 90 years old or 91 years old
[54:31.920 --> 54:39.440]  died at 95 Sunday night I guess that he was aware of the new world order and pretty smart guy
[54:41.360 --> 54:45.360]  there's a lot of other famous people you know he never said hey don't talk about us talking on
[54:45.360 --> 54:49.840]  air I just didn't want to go on air and say I just talked to Ernest Borgnein because it would sound
[54:49.840 --> 54:57.360]  so ridiculous but you know it's looking at many other interesting famous people we've had on the
[54:57.360 --> 55:06.240]  show from Charlton Heston to you name it Charlie Sheen the list just goes on and on and again it's
[55:06.240 --> 55:11.520]  not bragging hey I know famous people it's saying look freedom is popular there's a lot of interesting
[55:11.520 --> 55:17.920]  people that are aware of what's going on in the world of course we've heard Ed Asner on the show
[55:17.920 --> 55:25.200]  many times but he's aware of the new world order his his his fix for it is not is not what my fix
[55:25.200 --> 55:32.320]  would be but he certainly is a good guy at heart but Ernest Borgnein it's funny I was thinking
[55:32.320 --> 55:36.800]  about him a couple weeks ago and I thought I ought to dig that number out I ought to try to get a hole
[55:36.800 --> 55:44.720]  to him and get him on the show he is so cool I mean like 95 and still alive and I must have been
[55:44.720 --> 55:50.080]  thinking about him because he must have been sick or something but the same thing with Kurt Vonnegut
[55:50.960 --> 55:56.080]  I got sent some of his art told he was a listener got in touch with him he's like I'm too old no
[55:56.080 --> 56:00.480]  I'm not giving any more speeches I'm gonna give one more speech and I'm done he gave one more
[56:00.480 --> 56:04.640]  speech at university and was dead a year later but that would have been cool
[56:08.160 --> 56:13.040]  Harry Dean Stanton I've gotten to know him when in fact when I met him at Jesse Ventura's birthday
[56:13.040 --> 56:18.480]  party he's like I know you you're Alex Jones I like what you're doing and then you want to be cool
[56:18.480 --> 56:22.080]  and then not try to get him on the show you know he's in red dawn alien everything else you can
[56:22.080 --> 56:26.800]  imagine it's not just that he's a movie star it's that he's he's iconic and he's really old he's one
[56:26.800 --> 56:33.040]  of the old guild movie stars which is just I mean I could care less about say meeting Madonna
[56:34.080 --> 56:41.840]  I could care less about meeting Justin Timberlake or and I'm not even saying he's not a good actor
[56:41.840 --> 56:47.600]  I saw him in some of you called out of time now that was pretty good it's just there's something
[56:47.600 --> 56:53.200]  about you know there's certain people it's my love of humanity that's why it's okay to like Hollywood
[56:53.200 --> 56:57.760]  stars and people at a certain level because it's about liking humanity it's about realizing we're
[56:57.760 --> 57:01.920]  made in the image of the creator there's a lot of interesting souls out there because the globalist
[57:01.920 --> 57:07.760]  message is we're trash now the globalist show you the image of Hollywood does so you think you're
[57:07.760 --> 57:12.800]  not like them and feeling adequate but it's the other way around I have had a chance to
[57:13.600 --> 57:18.160]  because before I knew a lot of Hollywood people and other famous folks there was kind of like wow
[57:18.160 --> 57:23.520]  that's that unknown country that magic place but getting to meet so many famous people and get to
[57:23.520 --> 57:30.480]  know them many of them that have reached out to me over the years it it lost its magic which was a
[57:30.480 --> 57:36.720]  good thing you know I so many famous people say wow once I became famous I realized it doesn't mean
[57:36.720 --> 57:43.200]  anything doesn't mean really much at all there's some pluses there's also some minuses being famous
[57:43.200 --> 57:48.480]  is only good if you use it to better the world because that's the only thing that fulfills and
[57:48.480 --> 57:53.200]  I'm now ranting we're gonna go to break and come back with calls and then our guest I don't mean to
[57:53.200 --> 57:57.680]  get so negative but the world is negative if we don't admit the negative in the world we can't
[57:57.680 --> 58:02.240]  defend the positive because the positive outweighs the negative but people tend to not fight the
[58:02.240 --> 58:08.720]  negative so it takes over very simple equation but the evil is coming out in the open you notice
[58:08.720 --> 58:13.520]  all this stuff by big pharma and all the crimes and all the it's just coming out government drug
[58:13.520 --> 58:19.440]  dealing government gun-running but the government's answer is armed to the teeth and expand and go okay
[58:19.440 --> 58:24.640]  you know we're crooks now stick them up well you know what that isn't working there's a giant arms
[58:24.640 --> 58:30.800]  race citizens are buying three four five million guns a month you know this is a collision course
[58:30.800 --> 58:36.720]  we're on is my point prison planet dot tv info wars dot com with the tip of the spear we'll be right

[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:23.200]  also download an archival your mp3's try to hand them out to any willing participants but i appreciate
[01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:28.160]  what you're doing and getting the word out i just wanted to comment on uh some of that information
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:35.040]  on the tsa i don't i personally won't fly until the uh until this is reversed i know you had a
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:43.280]  congresswoman on uh last week i was talking about a bill she's trying to introduce to get the uh tsa
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:48.800]  back to screener status rather than well i mean again it's already illegal you don't even need
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:54.080]  to build a point out they've just declared themselves they are the stasi force they are they're
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:59.760]  already on the streets it's just a good force they just wear blue overalls now and come up to
[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:04.640]  on the highway i'm gonna search your vehicle i mean it's just it's just all made up craziness
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:10.320]  well you know peaceful resistance i'm all about it i mean uh when i drive down the street and i see
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:16.240]  a state cop come the other way and he's got his head turned toward me i do the exact same thing i bug
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:21.200]  out my eyes out at him just like he's bugging his eyes at me and they turn away they realize what
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:26.240]  they're doing i think and it's all about that i know it's bizarre when you see cops bugging their
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:31.600]  eyes out and you're driving down a road the speed limit they fly up on you and then there's a whole
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:37.280]  lane right next to you it's like what is the point of that i mean this is tyranny folks and now the tsa
[01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:43.760]  goes oh your dad's ashes and throws it on the ground or or rips off colostomy bags and laughs or
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:50.960]  takes kids away as they cry uh or makes fun of a group of deaf people screaming you effing deafies
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:57.280]  at them i mean it's just this is what we've become pretty vicious i like the romney approach though
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:03.120]  if you remember during the uh during the debates uh they could never get a lot of guys could never
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:08.560]  get romney to answer the question and romney finally said well i don't tell you what questions they
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:13.120]  asked me so don't tell me how to answer them i thought that was a great a great comment and if
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:19.120]  a cop pulls me over and asks me the question like you know why i pulled her over i'm just gonna give
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:25.840]  him the time of day like look at my watch and say you know 330 when he asked me why i'm gonna say
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:30.720]  well yeah i didn't ask you you know which questions they asked me why are you telling me how to answer
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:38.000]  get a little bit smart the point is the government is is involved in child trafficking on record it's
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:43.920]  it's not a government it's involved in every crime you can imagine at the top and there's nothing but
[01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:50.000]  all these new agencies hymn pecking us as we go bankrupt by design i'm done i'm done
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:56.480]  exactly i am just totally and completely through with it but again it's not just the bureaucracy
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:04:03.440]  it's the general public are like these incredibly cowardly creatures that roll over and who want

[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:47.520]  worldwide tied into all these quote strange weather patterns there's a story out of fox 13
[01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:56.400]  and it says obama parade parody causes controversy huntsville utah had a parade and one of them
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:10:03.120]  was called the obama nation and they called the secret service on it and said criticizing our
[01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:08.800]  president is illegal and remember we can play the newscast in fact i had you guys pull that up a
[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:14.080]  few weeks ago and we never played it the truth squads you know the newscast where they say it's
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:20.560]  illegal to criticize obama i want to play that in a moment if you can find that thank you and
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:24.320]  you've seen the school teachers say you're you're not allowed to criticize the president you can
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:29.920]  be arrested this is the new attitude and the media reports on it like maybe that's the case
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:34.880]  that's right you don't have free speech you don't talk bad about our dear leader i mean
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:41.040]  that's that's not something you do i mean what do you think this is america oh wait i guess it
[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:48.080]  used to be but we're not supposed to and then there's this article by kurt nimo up at info
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:55.360]  wars dot com pentagon test drone at civilian air park in ohio oh mommy what are the trips
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:58.880]  doing running checkpoints oh what are the marines doing over there oh they're just here
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:06.880]  acclimating us and admitting it's for martial law preparation wk r c tv and system of ohio
[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:13.440]  has put a friendly spin on the ongoing effort to introduce military technology into civilian realm
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:18.320]  the planes look and sound like radio controlled aircraft that anyone can buy and by the way
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:22.480]  they like these cheap noisy ones because they want you know they're there but they are modified
[01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:28.640]  with special systems for research and observation that's called spying and surveillance but kind of
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:34.320]  like the new army document that's public they don't even is for gun confiscation door to door it says
[01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:44.000]  gun evacuation god i love the orwellian terms they have here a lot of things that we use surprisingly
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:48.400]  you're from model airplane field now they call them switch blades they weaponize them too it's not
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:52.720]  really the aircraft that we're testing but the components inside like the autopilot and flight
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:59.040]  control system said mike plankton of the us air force yeah they test cheap ones first with their
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:04.960]  field people this is standard before giving them the more expensive ones and it's just how great
[01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:12.160]  it is to be surveilled by the pentagon beware of the military industrial complex we're being
[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:18.880]  absorbed by the bureaucracy they own the politicians those they don't own that's called being a terrorist
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:25.600]  but even the washington times has an article out today basically giving props to info wars.com
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:33.440]  and prisonpunna.com saying that we're basically all terrorists now in fact let me give you the exact
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:41.200]  let me give you the exact headline on that just type info wars.com into google nsa news
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:48.160]  prudent i guess that's the editor of the washington times the new terrorists they're all of us
[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:55.680]  and you know they've wired in now my computer we can actually see what i'm doing on screen that's
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:13:00.560]  awesome instead of them having to aim a camera just what i'm doing i just punch it up you're
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:09.120]  watching on prisonpunna.tv and it just goes on to say that well basically that we're all terrorists
[01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:15.040]  when a country has been taken over by what amounts to criminal gang which is what we now
[01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:22.720]  have in washington the quiet naturally practical everyone else in the country who becomes and
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:30.400]  comes to recognize this becomes a political adversary and it goes on to say that and the
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:36.240]  next person's like why aren't you going after the muslims because the quote muslim extremist
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:39.280]  work for the globalists that are being given control the middle east right now
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:47.040]  in fact there's even an article in the london telegraph today about that so al qaeda were you
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:53.600]  didn't know that it was never about al qaeda all the hardened bunkers and everything go ask the cops
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:59.040]  if they're trying to fight al qaeda are trying to fight you they're trying to fight you and you're
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:04.960]  like but i don't want to fight them oh when they come take your guns or they come conscript your
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:13.760]  children or the or the new tsa wants to rape your daughter you're going to end up going after
[01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:18.640]  them and you're going to be on the nightly news and on all the new jumbo trons as a terrorist
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:24.640]  and then the and then the party's on and that's the whole plan these guys are sitting around
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:29.680]  bored in the swat teams and everything you know it's tough having to go to mexican food restaurants
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:34.560]  three times a day and sit around in their cars all day i mean you know it's time to really have a
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:39.680]  war with america and don't worry it's gonna happen i'm sure you want it you go and get it
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:49.440]  i want to choose which side you're on but hey hey hey again the people running our government
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:58.880]  really are the nice guys aren't they knowingly in 1999 13 years ago the top insurance companies met
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:05.520]  with the department of defense and they decided because things render an emergency since 1933
[01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:10.080]  that they would just take all the death benefits of all the military personnel
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:12.480]  from world war two right through till now
[01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:20.080]  so they tell them of the army or navy or marines oh sign this form and it takes a small part of
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:27.200]  your checkout for a death benefit life insurance you sign it over your mama your daddy your wife
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:31.920]  your husband and you know what a lot of money built up in there in fact over a trillion dollars
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:40.080]  so they just took it and it was in the news bloomberg ap oh yeah they yeah when you die we
[01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:48.720]  we took it because we're the good guys yeah yeah man because they're fighting al-qaeda
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:55.360]  yeah right growing the opium and if you find out about all this like pat killman that and
[01:15:55.360 --> 01:16:00.320]  you're no longer useful they just kill you and say you died fighting al-qaeda which turned out to be a
[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:04.560]  lie and then you tell people this and they go yeah i know that's true alex but i don't want to think
[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:09.920]  about it oh really you don't want to think about it you just want to go wave an american flag on the

[01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:11.440]  how i see it they new world order the bankers they're they have their plan and they're committed
[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:18.000]  it and they know if they don't succeed with this they're going to fail and they're going to go to
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:21.840]  jail they're going to be prosecuted no that's it i mean no they're totally committed and
[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:25.280]  that people try to argue with them people sit there and try to have debates like oh they're
[01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:30.880]  misguided no they're following a public scientific program of total takeover
[01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:39.680]  in every facet of our life now i don't the people and i hear you you talk to your blue in the face
[01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:46.640]  and i i do the best i can try to wake people up videos they're your website planet info wars
[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:53.840]  dot com the new one you just put out and i don't think the people the citizens realize
[01:25:54.560 --> 01:26:01.520]  that this is not going to get better every day you come on the radio it's getting worse it's
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:07.920]  getting worse it's more it's more aspects of our life now it's getting cartoon crazy i can't believe
[01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:13.440]  how fast it's moving but but a lot of people are waking up right now so we have to take heart
[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:19.280]  there are a lot of people finally waking up to what's happening but the system just goes ahead
[01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:30.480]  with the takeover right and the last point i want to make is we citizens we have to like the actors
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:35.440]  the entertainers the sports they know what's going on they know exactly what's going on you
[01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:40.560]  don't get to that level and you don't see and hear things they know what's going on but they're
[01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:44.720]  keeping their mouth shut they don't want to talk they don't want to get involved and here we are
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:50.400]  spending two three hundred dollars a ticket to go to their game and meanwhile they know the big
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:55.920]  picture they know what's going on and no one's confronting them as well on top of the media
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:27:02.960]  that's because that's because of television and movies uh the whole corporate world they
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:09.440]  meet in these big board meetings you know the top fortune 100 or so they agree on the program
[01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:15.680]  they incrementally roll this stuff out that's why it's so hard to beat is that it's a creeping death
[01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:21.920]  but it's now reached a galloping speed so take heart i hear you all we can do is fight back
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:26.560]  against it and speak out against it because we'd be in a lot worse shape right now if folks hadn't
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:32.320]  been resisting it they're behind schedule that's why they're trying to move things forward a lot
[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:42.400]  faster now and kind of skip some of the in-between steps because they can see that the time is running
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:50.080]  very very short for them that's my point but for those that are in long long land they're in for a
[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:57.600]  very rude awakening steve in california you're on the air alex thanks for all you do thank you
[01:27:57.600 --> 01:28:04.800]  uh i just uh was over your skies last week and what i found surprising i uh got back into the
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:09.920]  country via miami and in all the years i've traveled and i mean millions of miles abroad
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:17.040]  the first time i'd ever been asked three specific times how much money i had on me or monetary
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:23.440]  instruments and the last uh dhs officer just looked me deadpan in the face and said how much
[01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:31.200]  cash you got on you now that's what this is all about is capital controls and if you would have
[01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:35.760]  had silver coins on your five or six they would have probably tried to take them and they admit
[01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:42.160]  you're not going to leave the country now if they say you owe them money no judge no jury i mean
[01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:47.920]  things are dark folks it takes courage just to stay here i mean i'm this is not rhetoric this is
[01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:55.280]  really happening it's it's bad and and uh brazilians themselves i got daft in brazil and
[01:28:55.280 --> 01:29:02.400]  i'll tell you they weren't too happy with the reo plus 20 crew to uh put it quite bluntly
[01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:07.920]  you know real and copacabana has a pretty famous nightlife and they're trying to shut all that down
[01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:15.920]  alex they're going to make it a family atmosphere if you can believe it well that's all as a part of
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:22.240]  reo plus 20 here and where i live in tomacula i'm right near camp panelton uh a major military
[01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:28.320]  facility and if you get a hold of a copy of the military press the july first issue i think it's
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:34.400]  very enlightening that the military is not asleep at the wheel with respect to who i refer to as the
[01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:39.600]  pimp in chief i tell what i want to hear about this issue maybe give us the headline again we'll

[01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:52.240]  steven california he was a local highway patrol military base publication there in california
[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:58.640]  the marine corps base and go ahead and tell us what it what it said well there was two commentaries
[01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:05.280]  in there alex and one was basically referring to our commander in chief is not paying any attention
[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:11.920]  to the constitution and performing acts that are basically seditious and and and being a traitor
[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:18.240]  to our nation and our constitution that's that's what it boiled down to and uh and is that a physical
[01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:22.960]  newspaper out there yes it is in fact uh you can go in front of any shopping center usually
[01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:29.360]  there's a free periodical publication a monthly publication in fact i can grab a copy today scan
[01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:35.840]  it and send it to you if you'd like yeah that'd be great show tips and info wars.com uh and just
[01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:40.960]  and just put something in there in the byline so we know but putting it back on screen for radio
[01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:46.720]  listeners we did pull up the site for the local newspaper uh what's the name of one of the articles
[01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:54.080]  and we'll search it and put it on screen right now uh dear mr president and the author was
[01:34:54.080 --> 01:35:00.400]  richard matt no no dear mr president yeah yeah dear mr president should get it and so this is
[01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:07.840]  something that's on the base as well yes yes uh we have a large community uh right around here in
[01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:13.440]  tomeka son of our population that's uh you know no i know that i know that's one of the biggest
[01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:18.240]  in the united states but you know the issue here is that's what you should be saying you're not supposed
[01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:23.440]  to just follow orders i mean if the president says grow opium in afghanistan you say no i'm not going
[01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:28.160]  to do it uh the president says ship cocaine and you say no i'm not going to do it if the president
[01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:33.520]  says ship guns 20 000 i'm to mexico and hand grenades you better not do it especially because
[01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:37.920]  if you get caught they're going to blame it on you which they've done so you know they keep catching
[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:44.960]  army and navy and marines shipping guns in and then it goes to court and the and the feds try to
[01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:49.840]  blame it on them and it turns out they've been ordered to do it and then they call them a you
[01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:56.160]  know a a a a gang uh so so people should know that you will be burned it's like folks that got
[01:35:56.160 --> 01:36:01.600]  ordered a torture and then when it came out they put them in prison and then bush still bragged oh
[01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:07.440]  but i still order the torture i do it again but then he sent people to prison when they got caught
[01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:14.400]  because they're doing illegal things uh but did we find that article gentlemen we're still looking
[01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:19.600]  for it well listen i'd like you to send me a copy of that so so it it is waking the military up
[01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:27.040]  that um that they are openly they're talking about the fact that the united nations and nato
[01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:33.280]  supposedly commands the military now and not congress yes yes and this is the same base where
[01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:39.440]  we have this sergeant just recently who was relieved of his command and i think dishonorably
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:46.080]  discharged because he posted on his uh web page facebook whatever i can't remember just what it was
[01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:55.440]  uh his dissatisfaction with the actions of the uh administration well again though there's also
[01:36:55.440 --> 01:37:01.360]  something else happening here obama's being blamed for all this and i hate rama manual i hate barack
[01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:08.320]  obama but they're just a mafia team hired because they'll get dirty and get all this done everything
[01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:13.920]  they're doing is what the big mega banks want that's why mitt romney on his actual policies
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:19.600]  did you see last week when mitt romney was like well i guess his quote was the supreme courts made
[01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:26.240]  its decision and we've got to abide by it and he went on and said this is not a tax it's a penalty
[01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:31.440]  agreeing with the white house unprecedented i think jack abronoff summed it up on that segment he
[01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:36.160]  had on 60 minutes last sunday in about one sentence he just said the whole damn system's corrupt
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:42.880]  well yeah everybody was saying oh listen to bernie made off you know saying hey i was just trying
[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:49.040]  to compete yes he was a quasi outsider even though he created the nasdaq and was he was in the upper
[01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:55.200]  echelon but the bottom of the upper echelon and he cheated a bunch of globalist is why he went to
[01:37:55.200 --> 01:38:00.320]  jail uh no no you're not supposed to do that you cheat the little guy you take the military's death
[01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:08.080]  benefits you steal the teacher and police pensions uh you know you do stuff like that you you got the
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:14.560]  country uh but you don't rip off the ultra rich and it's true whenever he gave that interview for
[01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:19.760]  new york a magazine and he said look what i'm doing is what the federal reserve does it's
[01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:27.280]  absolutely true but the federal reserve when the ponzi scheme goes belly up signs us on to their
[01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:34.720]  debt then has their media lecture us on how it's really our debt and how great they are pretty good
[01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:40.880]  business if you can get it wonderful to have means of people with your scapegoat you said it
[01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:45.760]  patriots that's all they are you said it brother thank you so much for the call great points let's
[01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:55.920]  talk to moose in florida moosher on the air hey alex hey buddy how you doing good uh yeah i think
[01:38:55.920 --> 01:39:03.360]  the the main word that i found uh the the un criminal organization is going to put us on there
[01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:12.000]  is a subversion for his putting us under all the countries uh not only the the us but uh all the
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:18.240]  countries around the world um they're trying to put out everything under one uh one umbrella
[01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:26.720]  no that i mean that's what they're saying it's it's called subversion and sedition if you don't
[01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:32.880]  agree to lawless evil and that's what the john warren defense authorization acts for it's what
[01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:41.040]  all the public army manuals for fema camps reeducation camps killing us confiscating our guns
[01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:49.040]  torturing us all of its public the only question is will the military actually follow the orders
[01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:53.200]  well the globalists aren't just going to wake up one sunday morning and say we're a big evil
[01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:57.840]  government taking over america has been captured by foreign banks well they actually do go on the
[01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:03.520]  news and say that but they're going to say we were hit you know chicago was hit by an abomb
[01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:09.920]  militia working with al qaeda or something like that or uh or or uh the militia released a bio
[01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:16.240]  weapon from the university of texas at galveston something like that and oh my gosh we've got
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:20.560]  to arrest all the people that are saying the government did it because they're trying to
[01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:26.560]  sow discord and and a lot of cowards will say just keep me safe the stock market plunged by
[01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:35.280]  5000 points arrest them and the yuppies will line up and say arrest alex jones he he's the reason
[01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:40.000]  the stock market went down and and you'll see a lot of others people we thought our friends in
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:46.000]  congress they'll suddenly line up and agree that's preposterous to say that criminal elements in
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:53.120]  government or corporations release the bio weapon uh yes it's it's yelling fire in a theater arrest
[01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:58.480]  anyone that says it and that's what they're priming for and then the civil war starts because
[01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:03.920]  yeah most people when the cops come to arrest you at your house are going to go you know to the
[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:07.680]  to the camp and be tortured and come out and say that you're a terrorist on the newsletter
[01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:12.080]  or be a double agent for them the torture camps are really about that the torture you in the camps
[01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:16.640]  and then release you as one of their agents later or to find innocent people that are weak minded
[01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:22.000]  and just and just you know so they can say oh they were formerly in a camp uh and so you can't
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:25.840]  believe them now when they get caught you know doing something criminal that most the al-qaeda
[01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:31.280]  leading the siege forces all over the middle east taking over right now and you know mutilating
[01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:37.200]  women and everything and blowing up the universities and you know putting burkas on the women uh they
[01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:44.400]  were trained in the last 10 years at x-ray a lot of them were 14 years old and now they are commanders
[01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:50.320]  you know u.s. helicopters land discordium with weapons gold everything they need to lead the
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:55.200]  opposition uh in the takeover so i'm sorry i'm ranting sir anything you'd like to add
[01:41:56.320 --> 01:42:03.520]  no that's fine and actually uh there's one one more point uh there's a uh youtube video on uh
[01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:13.120]  psychological warfare subversion uh by uh xjb um propaganda uh specialist uh u d
[01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:22.000]  the yes man over yeah i've seen it i've seen it and uh it's uh the destruction of uh social
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:28.960]  infrastructure uh in each single country yeah that's the thing if you read a kgb takeover plan
[01:42:29.920 --> 01:42:35.680]  it's exactly what the globalists are following all their tactics are guerrilla warfare all their
[01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:41.360]  tactics are right out of a soviet manual but it's run by bankers but wait the mega bankers
[01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:47.680]  funded linen and stylin this is it they want a breakdown they'll pose as saviors mass culling
[01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:54.240]  reeducation uh the rural affairs council under the pentagon is meant to start everybody out
[01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:59.760]  posing as saviors the collaborators will be allowed to operate it is just going to be hell on earth
[01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:05.120]  if they're able to launch it but they are attempting to launch a soviet style collapse
[01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:13.920]  reeducation go ahead yeah that you're absolutely right and um and i i ask all the all the info
[01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:19.520]  warriors and uh uh your uh the the callers that speak more than one language to get the word
[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:25.840]  out um because like how you said you quoted before uh we're surrounded and doesn't matter
[01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:32.720]  where you fire the information uh it just makes sure it goes out doesn't matter which language
[01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:38.400]  yeah that's again the marine corps general surrounded in korea by roughly 10 times this
[01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:42.640]  number is probably more but and they said sir we're completely surrounded and cut off and
[01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:48.080]  they said good now we can attack in all directions and they were able to uh uh fight their way out
[01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:53.520]  but but yes you're absolutely right i mean look i'm not up here theatrically saying this we've
[01:43:53.520 --> 01:44:00.240]  analyzed it all and i'll go read some soviet reeducation document from the 40s and the 50s
[01:44:00.240 --> 01:44:05.040]  where they were taken over countries and it's word for word what homeland security is doing
[01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:13.040]  i mean it's everything they do is a psychological operation to destroy the country and it's just
[01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:18.320]  so off the charts crazy i can't believe it's happening i don't blame people for not believing
[01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:27.440]  this it's it's i'm getting chills right now i appreciate your call it's so horrible we should
[01:44:27.440 --> 01:44:35.120]  be able to just not do this can't we just not do this and does this has to have has to happen i mean
[01:44:35.120 --> 01:44:42.960]  why why and so many people are cowardly going to serve this just because it's so scary deep down
[01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:46.960]  inside they're going to make excuses to themselves terry in texas you're on the air welcome
[01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:50.240]  hello yes go ahead
[01:44:50.240 --> 01:44:58.400]  i've got a tsa victory story for you okay tell me well uh my daughter was flying
[01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:03.520]  internationally last week at a dfw airport and this was her first time to fly she's gonna be
[01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:09.440]  flying by herself oh that's where they went and miss usa's pants yeah well that that was that was
[01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:14.320]  really concerning me my wife we were praying about it and that was really our only concern
[01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:19.680]  with her flying internationally so we get to the airport we go to the check in to check in her
[01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:24.480]  baggage and we ask if there's any way we can get in the airport with her because she was flying
[01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:30.320]  by herself and it was myself and my wife my son and my daughter who's 15 and she's really cute so
[01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:36.560]  i just wanted to be along with her and uh the lady's like well we can give one pass and so she
[01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:39.920]  checks in her bag and she's like you know what i'm gonna go ahead and give you all passes so you
[01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:45.680]  can get in we start walking up to the gate you know i thought they'd be eyeballing my daughter
[01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:50.880]  but it's like they were looking at my my son he was a supermodel coming up to the coming up to the
[01:45:50.880 --> 01:45:57.040]  the tsa screening counter on your phone broken for a minute who were they who were they pepe
[01:45:57.040 --> 01:46:03.440]  lapioing that was my son oh yeah that's that's you know that's mainly their favorite so what
[01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:09.040]  else happened so we we go we go in there we go in and they say okay you need to go to the right
[01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:13.760]  which would be the body scanner and my wife says you know we don't want to do that so they yell
[01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:19.360]  opt out and then a guy probably in his 50s comes around and he just grabs us and he says he's like
[01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:24.800]  don't worry about it and puts us through the metal detector and that was it they didn't touch us
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:31.600]  but they were actually body body scanning people and they were groping them after the body scan
[01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:36.080]  and it was just you know we got out there we got out of there without even being touched well thank
[01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:40.000]  god for that what they've done more and more is that it's caught they know we're at the breaking
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:45.360]  point so it's it's guerrilla warfare when they know that when you're going to get mad they back off
[01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:52.720]  when you give in they they do more and more and more and more and more including taking women's
[01:46:52.720 --> 01:46:58.240]  tops off saying i want to date with you they just had to settle a lawsuit uh was it an amaryllis
[01:46:58.240 --> 01:47:04.640]  for that i mean they they are flip tsa i'm not joking folks well multiple times stripped down
[01:47:04.640 --> 01:47:10.160]  naked and began running around screaming i'm god i mean who else wants to act like this all day
[01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:16.880]  somebody who's got good self-image intelligent competent would be embarrassed to treat anybody
[01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:22.000]  like this but again this is the psych warfare if there's a real threat which of course it's
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:27.360]  manufactured you would profile but they're like no no no we're politically correct so we we take
[01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:33.920]  the diaper off a one year old or or we make an old woman strip search it's about being outrageous
[01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:39.040]  and over the top what do you think of the group of deaf people coming in from a conference uh
[01:47:39.040 --> 01:47:45.200]  being uh uh being attacked uh and being screamed at and called uh you know deafies and all this
[01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:51.200]  stuff and having their their their stuff stolen in front of them oh it's disgusting and and one
[01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:55.840]  thing my daughter said when we got out she said she said you know what i thought alex was exaggerating
[01:47:55.840 --> 01:48:00.320]  about these people and you know it was worse than than we even thought it was going to be these
[01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:06.720]  people look like just you know stereotypical pedophiles oh i know listen if you're walking
[01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:12.240]  down a street at night and you see a guy with trash cans coming out the back of a restaurant
[01:48:12.240 --> 01:48:16.720]  you know it's somebody that works there you know you instantly look that they're wearing an apron
[01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:22.160]  they've got a hair net on whatever or if you're walking down an alley to your parked car from a
[01:48:22.160 --> 01:48:27.840]  meeting or whatever and you see giggling women who look like they're drunk you instantly make a
[01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:32.080]  decision that's girls having fun it's not even conscious okay there's a guy getting it's not
[01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:36.240]  that i'm living in fear but if i'm cutting through to get to my car or something you know midnight
[01:48:36.240 --> 01:48:41.840]  or something after a business meeting or whatever and and i'm downtown you know i'm scanning show i
[01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:46.960]  scan okay that's a guy taking the trash out all right that's some drunk women all right uh that's
[01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:54.800]  a male by himself instant scan clean cut uh statistically uh you know criminals generally
[01:48:54.800 --> 01:49:00.800]  you know wear a uniform that's how stupid they are statistically not a threat but i'll still
[01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:08.160]  walk on the other side but you see four or five guys gangbanger type acting tough giggling you
[01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:13.840]  can see the predator look how they'll be bouncing on their toes whether they're black white old
[01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:18.960]  young hispanic it's the same attitude of thinking they're tough they're they're sizing you up like a
[01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:26.320]  like a like a group of wolves you as a human have instant analysis of what the situation is
[01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:32.160]  and tsa wasn't like this even five six years ago they are fully now shifting in because normal
[01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:35.680]  folks are getting out of there i've had a lot of them actually come to our rallies and stuff
[01:49:35.680 --> 01:49:44.960]  against the tsa uh and now it's shifting into criminals the body language the look everything
[01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:51.280]  is these are criminals uh and you're absolutely right and it's a collection of just ne'er do well
[01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:56.880]  scum and and the globalists knew that they knew the good people are going to get out
[01:49:56.880 --> 01:50:00.800]  and it's going to be nothing but absolute scum and this is going to be their new
[01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:09.200]  stawzy army to pour out on the streets of america a final comment on that well i also i just i
[01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:13.600]  believe it was nothing more than than the hand of the lord and it was like it was like beating
[01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:17.760]  that car wars where these are not the droids you're looking for and you know what it was just
[01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:22.400]  it was god with his hand on us and he just delivered us from our worst fears and you know
[01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:27.200]  it we're just we're just thankful to him well thank you god bless you and again folks if you
[01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:32.720]  don't have children it is scary a 15 year old daughter that would be somewhat scary but imagine
[01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:37.440]  your three year old girl or boy and you know kids don't like strangers to begin with it's a good
[01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:42.880]  instinct and they take them and go okay come over here and the little kid gets drug away i've seen
[01:50:42.880 --> 01:50:47.200]  it with their arm out towards mama they're like stand back stand back no and then they take them
[01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:52.160]  and put the little kid in a cage the little kid scared looking around being traumatized
[01:50:52.160 --> 01:50:59.200]  and then here comes the pedo like an eel comes coming right up it's pedo time i mean it's incredible
[01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:07.840]  folks have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on

[01:51:12.080 --> 01:51:18.080]  been a better time to get ready for the winter power outages ahead here's why solar power generators
[01:51:18.080 --> 01:51:22.960]  are now available from our friends at solutions from science one of our oldest sponsors their
[01:51:22.960 --> 01:51:28.320]  emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most unlike gas
[01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:34.000]  generators a solar generator runs quietly amidst no fumes and produces electricity from the sun
[01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:39.280]  it's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own own whether it's ice storms

[01:54:06.720 --> 01:54:22.160]  because there's a war on for your mind i was thinking of the nerve of all of these different big
[01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:28.560]  pharma companies to knowingly sell you drugs that they know are going to kill you and don't even
[01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:38.800]  protect you whether it's for measles mumps rubella uh the human papillomavirus gartersfield h1n1 flu
[01:54:38.800 --> 01:54:46.640]  they knew it didn't protect human actually hurt you that all came out and here it is in the news
[01:54:46.640 --> 01:54:55.680]  i mean they knew louvox or vioxx would kill a bunch of people they they knew that this and made tens
[01:54:55.680 --> 01:55:06.240]  of billions a year that this ad there did not protect you did not help made asthma worse and
[01:55:06.240 --> 01:55:18.320]  would cause all sorts of endocrine failure and death and they've paid a tiny fine
[01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:27.840]  of what a billion dollars and they go on to describe in the previous reports during the
[01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:32.720]  same period of time the u.s. department of justice began a lengthy investigation of black show
[01:55:32.720 --> 01:55:38.080]  resulting in recent civil and criminal fines of three billion of improper off-label marketing of
[01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:46.640]  antidepressants paxil and wellbutrin and ad there it just goes on how they sell all this as if it's
[01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:52.880]  good for you knowing it's bad folks they knew in the trials of prozac that it caused massive
[01:55:52.880 --> 01:56:01.520]  increases in suicide and violent activity they know all this they know exactly what they're doing
[01:56:02.240 --> 01:56:06.960]  and again if you study the real world if you watch my film in-game or all the reports i've
[01:56:06.960 --> 01:56:11.680]  done or that erin dykes has done i always say the banking cartels are at the top of the new
[01:56:11.680 --> 01:56:17.840]  world order that's not really true the globalists get their power out of banking and out of the
[01:56:17.840 --> 01:56:23.120]  fact that they can issue unlimited fake currency and credit and different financial instruments
[01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:28.800]  and then control the regulators and so it's not it's not seen as fraud but it is fraudulent
[01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:35.280]  so that's where they get their power from but who they are is big pharma they're obsessed with
[01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:41.840]  medical tyranny and it's the big insurance companies big pharma that on record wrote the
[01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:46.000]  health care law and now they're saying they're going to shift and by the way my dad is in
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:50.400]  health care he's in health care management as well so i get to hear about this all the time
[01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:57.360]  about how everything is shifting towards government control and towards drugs where
[01:56:57.360 --> 01:57:02.160]  they're trying to say doctors dentists you name it can't even do the treatments they think are best
[01:57:02.160 --> 01:57:06.800]  you've got to come in and give the treatment well you heard last week i had dr blalock on
[01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:12.800]  about it this is social engineering and and this is what's going on and then i was thinking about
[01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:21.360]  the nerve of google in a press release in 2005 saying we use the microphones and cameras on
[01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:27.280]  the computers to listen to you with ai computers then we sell the data and we wrote articles
[01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:32.240]  about it and people said oh you're insane this couldn't be true with a link to their press release
[01:57:32.240 --> 01:57:38.400]  on google's website now here we are seven years later it's like oh yeah tell me something i don't
[01:57:38.400 --> 01:57:46.720]  know how do we go from that would never happen to oh yeah it's no big deal driving around worldwide
[01:57:46.720 --> 01:57:52.880]  with tens of thousands of google cars many of them now robotic a whole bunch of states have
[01:57:52.880 --> 01:57:59.600]  robot cars driving around on them with these big antennas on top that instantly crack the codes
[01:57:59.600 --> 01:58:04.320]  because they're designed with back doors they're the nsa to steal all the data off your computer

[02:00:58.640 --> 02:01:04.240]  at a date in ohio i'm not sure if you're aware but there's a lot of local industry involved in
[02:01:04.240 --> 02:01:10.720]  this area with uh right paterson air force space developing drone technology and uh friend of mine
[02:01:10.720 --> 02:01:17.200]  attends a local community college and claire community college and a few weeks ago he had
[02:01:17.200 --> 02:01:24.800]  a gentleman from an organization called information control corporation come in and was talking about
[02:01:24.800 --> 02:01:31.120]  their work with drones in our area and uh he said that there's already drones in the sky over
[02:01:31.120 --> 02:01:37.840]  date in ohio and they've already contributed to dozens of arrests and they fly at high altitude
[02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:46.320]  and use high resolution cameras to just zoom in on whatever they want to zoom in on yeah with taxpayer
[02:01:46.320 --> 02:01:51.360]  money it's it's unlimited just take another house take another farm buy a bunch of drones
[02:01:51.360 --> 02:01:57.440]  it's actually in the news uh with the pentagon in ohio today uh this is pentagon test drones at
[02:01:57.440 --> 02:02:03.680]  civilian air park in ohio and they go on to say it's part of surveilling the public again this is
[02:02:03.680 --> 02:02:08.320]  just totally training you that you're the enemy has nothing to do with stopping crime all these
[02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:14.880]  cameras the rest of it it's all about surveilling you and making you feel powerless that's what
[02:02:14.880 --> 02:02:20.320]  government wants you to feel like and yes this is the new economy is as i've said surveillance
[02:02:20.320 --> 02:02:28.080]  checkpoints drones armored vehicles as one side of the society basically absorbs or resorbs the
[02:02:28.080 --> 02:02:34.960]  other side of society i agree and that's why we just try to get out on the streets and uh
[02:02:34.960 --> 02:02:41.040]  participate in your contests and do our own kind of things to just continue to try and wake up our
[02:02:41.040 --> 02:02:48.480]  community uh you know we were out hanging posters the other day and uh for the latest contest and
[02:02:48.480 --> 02:02:53.360]  it's amazing i mean everybody you talk to i mean they know that the government's crooks and and they
[02:02:53.360 --> 02:02:59.520]  know that our rights are being violated and you know obama's a scumbag and romney's a scumbag
[02:02:59.520 --> 02:03:04.640]  but i think a lot of people just don't realize to what extent you know the control grid is being
[02:03:04.640 --> 02:03:09.520]  set up and uh you know we're just trying to spread the word and you know hopefully turn
[02:03:09.520 --> 02:03:14.480]  it tight against these people well i totally agree with you well said that's why we're having
[02:03:14.480 --> 02:03:19.760]  the stop obama dictator contest that's extended through this friday i've been so busy i haven't
[02:03:19.760 --> 02:03:25.840]  gone out and hung them up yet i am going today i am going today to hang up posters and shoot video
[02:03:25.840 --> 02:03:30.800]  and talk about why i'm doing it and then we'll uh air that tomorrow here on the show but everybody
[02:03:30.800 --> 02:03:36.320]  post your own posters you know there's poison in the water fluoride the vaccines are deadly big
[02:03:36.320 --> 02:03:41.840]  pharma wants to kill you uh foreign banks took over america that's why we had the v for victory
[02:03:41.840 --> 02:03:47.120]  contest we should just bring that back don't want to have a contest to do it we've got to show people
[02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:54.080]  the power of the grassroots that's why i cannot state enough we have had we've been delisted by
[02:03:54.080 --> 02:03:59.520]  google on google news we get harassed they try every form of censorship in corporate america
[02:04:00.160 --> 02:04:06.400]  it doesn't matter you the people spreading the word about info wars dot com prison planet dot com
[02:04:06.960 --> 02:04:11.280]  without you we wouldn't be able to do this we're hiring new reporters we're expanding
[02:04:11.280 --> 02:04:18.800]  in the face of tyranny we're expending uh the capital that we've accrued in a all-in fight
[02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:23.440]  against the globalist uh because people now are beginning to realize this is really real
[02:04:24.240 --> 02:04:29.440]  again again as i've said a hundred times this is not a boss hog takeover that would not be good
[02:04:30.160 --> 02:04:35.680]  because a boss hog takeover leads to a hot tyranny we had we've had boss hog in charge for probably
[02:04:35.680 --> 02:04:45.600]  80 90 years now boss hog died folks we got the devil and uh the globalist want to kill the majority
[02:04:45.600 --> 02:04:51.280]  of the world population everything that you're seeing is only the build-up towards a global
[02:04:51.280 --> 02:04:58.640]  straightjacket to tie us down so the scientific technocrats seek and engage in orderly extermination
[02:04:58.640 --> 02:05:03.600]  now what are we going to do about it sick of the globalist eugenesis control freaks adding poison

[02:08:43.920 --> 02:08:48.720]  colorado well there's always climate change napolitano said there's a pattern here and she
[02:08:48.720 --> 02:08:54.320]  noted these summer wildfires as well as the east coast heatwave and the high velocity winds whipped
[02:08:54.320 --> 02:08:58.400]  through the mid-atlantic last week thousands of people remain without electricity because of the
[02:08:58.400 --> 02:09:05.120]  windstorm people always had big fires and big windstorms and big prairie fires uh it some
[02:09:05.120 --> 02:09:12.320]  summers are always hotter than others but i've always pointed out that there is weather manipulation
[02:09:12.320 --> 02:09:17.040]  and modification going on it's admitted that billions a year spent by the department of energy
[02:09:17.040 --> 02:09:23.360]  alone and department of defense engaged in weather modification i remember it was in the san antonio
[02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:31.280]  express news gotta be like 12 years ago is a footnote blurb they had flooding that killed over 30
[02:09:31.280 --> 02:09:38.000]  people in one day in south texas and then they said oh and the air force says the weather
[02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:44.080]  modification the drills they were doing the the uh to cause rain had nothing to do with it
[02:09:46.640 --> 02:09:49.760]  it's almost like that gun you saw me shoot your neighbor in the head with it had nothing to do
[02:09:49.760 --> 02:09:56.720]  with his head getting blown off the point is this stuff's been going on forever and they can easily
[02:09:56.720 --> 02:10:01.680]  and have admitted that they will use it as a weapon against countries that don't pay off their imf
[02:10:01.680 --> 02:10:08.800]  world bank loans you name it the globalists are all about playing god that's what all the gmo is
[02:10:08.800 --> 02:10:15.040]  about that in the major studies that are out there screws up the gut flora the gmo corn wheat you
[02:10:15.040 --> 02:10:21.920]  name it and then don't worry bill gates is coming out with patents on new gmo milk that gives you
[02:10:21.920 --> 02:10:27.920]  new gut flora he's spending billions on and he's involved in the weather modification as well
[02:10:27.920 --> 02:10:32.640]  because this is where the whole future is going they're engineering our future
[02:10:33.360 --> 02:10:39.360]  and not asking us questions about it they're releasing the gmo mosquitoes and not asking us
[02:10:39.360 --> 02:10:45.360]  have a guest on the nightly news tonight uh covering that shalom news did a good job of this
[02:10:46.160 --> 02:10:51.680]  gates and monsanto go after milk in the near future by the way guys there was a new york
[02:10:51.680 --> 02:10:56.880]  daily news article about the hatari militia guy getting his guns back i meant to cover sunday
[02:10:56.880 --> 02:11:00.640]  after i take calls i want to cover that will you repull that article or print it for me
[02:11:00.640 --> 02:11:06.080]  just because it's it implied having guns was terrorist and i just want to illustrate how
[02:11:06.080 --> 02:11:10.480]  disconnected the so-called corporate media is well they're not disconnected they're
[02:11:10.480 --> 02:11:17.040]  they're operatives of the globalist so what's their answer to less and less of us believing their
[02:11:17.040 --> 02:11:22.720]  bull bringing internet censorship in to shut down their competition that's their answer
[02:11:22.720 --> 02:11:28.560]  but i digress gates and monsanto go after milk and the reason i want to cover this is
[02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:34.320]  we've been talking about this the last few years gates is putting billions into gut flora research
[02:11:35.520 --> 02:11:42.800]  and take just the bt corn if bugs eat it they die a few months ago i made a big
[02:11:42.800 --> 02:11:47.920]  joke out of it a sick joke because there was a washington post headline
[02:11:47.920 --> 02:11:53.040]  in fact i could pretty much give you the exact headline you can look it up yourself
[02:11:55.040 --> 02:12:00.560]  washington post monsanto says farmers not planting
[02:12:03.520 --> 02:12:12.480]  monsanto says farmers not following planting rules for insects monsanto says farmers not
[02:12:12.480 --> 02:12:18.480]  following rules and then hidden in the article it said uh yeah you're supposed to plant refuge crops
[02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:23.840]  that are one third of your regular crops so bugs have something to eat because it's not good to
[02:12:23.840 --> 02:12:30.640]  have all the bugs die in the area and so under environmental agreements bugs dying is is is bad
[02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:37.840]  you dying is good basically and if the in fact they found the article there it is makers resently
[02:12:37.840 --> 02:12:42.640]  modified seeds say more farmers evading epa rules i think that's it yeah yeah print it
[02:12:42.640 --> 02:12:47.760]  monsanto co and other seed makers reported a three-fold increase last year and us farmers
[02:12:47.760 --> 02:12:52.960]  caught violating rules to stop insects for developing resistance is genetically modified corn
[02:12:52.960 --> 02:12:58.880]  the rules affect farmers planting seeds modified to produce the toxin delivered from bacillus
[02:12:58.880 --> 02:13:06.160]  throngensis or bt a natural insecticide yeah um there's uh you know poison and plants they can
[02:13:06.160 --> 02:13:10.080]  call it natural but it grows about a thousand times stronger than it normally does is the point
[02:13:11.200 --> 02:13:16.480]  and then you eat it the environmental protection agency requires those growers to also plant an
[02:13:16.480 --> 02:13:24.400]  adjacent area a so-called refuge haha of bt corn so that bugs feed on both types of corn and don't
[02:13:24.400 --> 02:13:31.200]  become immune to the toxin about 41 percent of the three thousand three farmers inspected you
[02:13:31.200 --> 02:13:36.880]  gotta get inspected when you buy seeds from these guys in 0 11 they're really just gmo organisms
[02:13:36.880 --> 02:13:42.400]  failed to comply with the refuge requirement according to data that monsanto provided last
[02:13:42.400 --> 02:13:48.880]  week seed companies are concerned that bugs resistance to modified crops may be increasing
[02:13:48.880 --> 02:13:54.800]  oh all right let's stop right there gets into the bt gene engineer they've got it where it creates a
[02:13:54.800 --> 02:13:59.840]  poisonous fungus another one creates a poisonous bacteria conservatively a thousand times
[02:13:59.840 --> 02:14:06.240]  i think the number was 1200 and something times on average stronger but plants can also mutate and
[02:14:06.240 --> 02:14:13.280]  have it a lot stronger and so their argument is well it's natural well i can pick up a natural
[02:14:13.280 --> 02:14:18.800]  20 pound rock and bash your brains out with it too a lot of plants grow cyanide strict nine
[02:14:19.680 --> 02:14:25.920]  a lot of plants grow high levels of arsenic in them uh there are silver night shade grows all
[02:14:25.920 --> 02:14:31.440]  over texas out in fields witches would take it to hallucinate in old england uh don't want to
[02:14:31.440 --> 02:14:35.280]  get folks out to take it it's very dangerous the point is you eat about a leaf of that you're
[02:14:35.280 --> 02:14:39.760]  going to have a violent hallucination before your heart explodes does that make it okay because
[02:14:39.760 --> 02:14:48.080]  it's natural i always love folks that say but it's natural it's natural but they unnaturally
[02:14:48.080 --> 02:14:54.480]  engineer the plant to not have it growing on the outside of the corn but the corn grows it inside
[02:14:54.480 --> 02:15:00.560]  and then bugs eat it and what do bugs do bugs fall over and die but they say it's safe for you
[02:15:01.520 --> 02:15:09.840]  to then eat it and then suddenly you see off the charts incredible different intestinal
[02:15:09.840 --> 02:15:18.400]  and stomach disorders uh irritable bowel uh crones i mean it is guys type in massive increase in
[02:15:18.400 --> 02:15:24.320]  crones massive increase in intestinal disorders i mean i i don't want to exaggerate here because i
[02:15:24.320 --> 02:15:32.880]  do the math like i don't know the math of one in 25 300 having autism 29 years ago and now it's
[02:15:32.880 --> 02:15:38.800]  one in 58 what thousand percent increases that i don't know i've done the math on the cancer
[02:15:39.360 --> 02:15:46.480]  pediatric cancers you know depending on the type would be one out of two million in the 30s and then
[02:15:46.480 --> 02:15:50.640]  now that same pediatric cancer is one out of 20 something thousand i mean you've got to look up
[02:15:50.640 --> 02:15:56.400]  the numbers yourself and do the do the metric increase but the point is it's straight up out of
[02:15:56.400 --> 02:16:06.240]  sight insane in your face but my point is is that gut disorders are just everywhere and there's
[02:16:06.240 --> 02:16:11.360]  toxicity in the gut that then causes chronic toxicity in the brain those two are connected
[02:16:11.360 --> 02:16:18.800]  just devastating effect on our society and bill melinda gates who own part of monsanto and who
[02:16:18.800 --> 02:16:24.160]  were also part of eugenics operations worldwide and caught doing all form of you know sterilization
[02:16:25.040 --> 02:16:30.960]  you name it funding un programs and more and more this is coming out we've been talking about it
[02:16:30.960 --> 02:16:34.720]  for 10 years finally they're going wait a minute they're funding forced abortion wait a minute they're
[02:16:34.720 --> 02:16:40.240]  going to forced abortion conferences wait a minute you know they do say get rid of the population
[02:16:40.240 --> 02:16:48.560]  they do want death panels yeah i know he dresses like a non-threatening nerd now there's a pub med
[02:16:48.560 --> 02:16:54.080]  dot gov the increasing prevalence of crone's disease and industrialized societies the price of
[02:16:54.080 --> 02:17:00.640]  progress in fact we've got a new yorker magazine article talking about sterility in the west and
[02:17:00.640 --> 02:17:07.520]  just says well it's part of the way it is anyways this is being done by design it's not the average
[02:17:07.520 --> 02:17:15.600]  toxins that are the main contributor it's the gmo crops you know over 80 percent of the filler foods
[02:17:15.600 --> 02:17:24.480]  the corn the soybeans the wheat the sugar beets do i need to go on all the major food crops now
[02:17:24.480 --> 02:17:31.440]  are over 80 percent when i say 80 i'm guessing down on average there's metrics of this so 89
[02:17:31.440 --> 02:17:36.560]  percent of us corn gmo and it just goes down the list i'm just saying 80 percent it's actually over
[02:17:36.560 --> 02:17:44.880]  that but it the average is very you are being bombarded with this okay okay so you're you're
[02:17:44.880 --> 02:17:49.200]  a woman your hair is falling out your thyroid is going out at 35 you just got diagnosed with
[02:17:49.200 --> 02:17:55.760]  cancer your sister did really hurting women uh all this is going on you're being murdered you're
[02:17:55.760 --> 02:18:04.320]  being murdered murdered murdered let me say it again murdered yeah there's the mosquito solution
[02:18:04.320 --> 02:18:11.520]  can genetic modification eliminate a deadly tropical disease oh yes genetic modification
[02:18:11.520 --> 02:18:17.360]  they're going to make you take a shot through the mosquito oh it looked obama's smiling on the
[02:18:17.360 --> 02:18:28.160]  cover he's your doctor now it's trendy he's black it must be okay again just the total
[02:18:28.160 --> 02:18:33.680]  political correctness no matter what color these people are they're a bunch of globalist killers
[02:18:33.680 --> 02:18:38.720]  and it goes on to say bill gauge pays for experiments to genetically modify humans
[02:18:39.920 --> 02:18:45.680]  bill gates just gave 8.3 million grant to develop gmo designer humans by simply altering the
[02:18:45.680 --> 02:18:52.240]  leading or adding certain gut bacteria and fungi corporations create designer human consumers in
[02:18:52.240 --> 02:18:56.480]  the near future so they're advertising they're going to do this to you and then make you have to buy
[02:18:56.480 --> 02:19:03.680]  stuff from them they don't even hide the business model oh you're dying from crones will finally bill
[02:19:03.680 --> 02:19:10.480]  gates has got something for you and look he's a smiling little guy he's a nice man we're in a suit
[02:19:10.480 --> 02:19:16.000]  i mean come on you know so what are your kid you know has to get their guts chopped out and dies
[02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:24.560]  in surgery with crones i mean so what and it just goes on to say that uh and fungus corporations
[02:19:24.560 --> 02:19:29.520]  can create designer human customers in their future and bill gates wants to do just that starting
[02:19:29.520 --> 02:19:35.920]  by quote spiking that's the word they use the milk that a toddler drinks gates and corporations he
[02:19:35.920 --> 02:19:42.240]  licenses could potentially make a human short tall smart dumb submissive aggressive autistic this
[02:19:42.240 --> 02:19:50.000]  is what they say savant healthy or constantly in need of pharmaceutical drugs or depend on windows
[02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:55.760]  computer-based assist us the rest of their life not joking see they know the gut is causing the
[02:19:55.760 --> 02:20:02.720]  brain damage their engineering is through it we'll be right back hi this is alex jones did you know
[02:20:02.720 --> 02:20:07.280]  that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the arctic
[02:20:07.280 --> 02:20:11.680]  circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than
[02:20:11.680 --> 02:20:16.080]  silver or gold it's true seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country
[02:20:16.080 --> 02:20:20.480]  and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science

[02:24:23.360 --> 02:24:27.680]  you guys you see nerves come out of your brain
[02:24:27.680 --> 02:24:39.000]  and grow into your eyes in utero inside your mother and of course you have your
[02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:42.520]  spinal cord that is connected to your brain and nerves that go into your
[02:24:42.520 --> 02:24:49.680]  stomach and so just like you drink and then you get a buzz in your brain or
[02:24:49.680 --> 02:24:54.560]  you eat and you get energy in your brain the system knows they're attacking
[02:24:54.560 --> 02:25:01.640]  our brain through the food the dyes the preservatives all of it and
[02:25:01.640 --> 02:25:07.640]  villain Melinda Gates make money owning Monsanto they pretty much control it
[02:25:07.640 --> 02:25:17.520]  on destroying your gut flora and now they're going to give you the treatment
[02:25:17.520 --> 02:25:24.280]  to where oh you babies don't have gut flora anymore we have a treatment and
[02:25:24.280 --> 02:25:30.680]  then your baby gets a new gut flora genetically designed by them human milk
[02:25:30.680 --> 02:25:37.840]  produced in cows udders so you're allowed to survive that's the business
[02:25:37.840 --> 02:25:44.280]  model cut your legs off sell you bionic legs basically but of course they have
[02:25:44.280 --> 02:25:50.400]  the back door to it and that's why now the miniaturization has gotten it
[02:25:50.400 --> 02:25:56.360]  inexpensive enough now that they can launch drones basically over every
[02:25:56.360 --> 02:25:59.480]  neighborhood and so they're going to do it and you're going to pay for it and
[02:25:59.480 --> 02:26:04.720]  they're going to make money off of it while they rape your privacy and if you
[02:26:04.720 --> 02:26:08.240]  don't like that a SWAT team will drop by and they're going to continue to raise
[02:26:08.240 --> 02:26:17.040]  the taxes till you lose your property and they're going to take it and so the
[02:26:17.040 --> 02:26:28.240]  world turns and they know exactly what they're doing but don't worry a big
[02:26:28.240 --> 02:26:40.160]  sis was asked by the Hill newspaper about what she thought about the bad
[02:26:40.160 --> 02:26:45.000]  weather ask point blank if the wildfires were caused by climate change to
[02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:50.240]  Polatano responded it could be a lot of different things but then she explained
[02:26:50.240 --> 02:26:57.200]  and expanded her view which seemed to make a connection between climate change
[02:26:57.200 --> 02:27:02.680]  and the weather events you have to look at climate change over a period of years
[02:27:02.680 --> 02:27:08.600]  not just one summer to Polatano said you could always have one abnormal summer
[02:27:08.600 --> 02:27:15.680]  but when you see one after another after another then you can see and say yeah
[02:27:15.680 --> 02:27:22.280]  there's a pattern here funny all this climate change that they say is going on
[02:27:22.280 --> 02:27:26.400]  well number one climate change is the only thing that is constant is change
[02:27:26.400 --> 02:27:32.480]  that's number one but number two if there's giant ongoing weather
[02:27:32.480 --> 02:27:38.360]  modification going on all over the world and the Pentagon has documents like
[02:27:38.360 --> 02:27:45.680]  owning the weather 2025 and they admit they're doing all these tests why
[02:27:45.680 --> 02:27:50.160]  shouldn't that be looked at why shouldn't that be discussed because if
[02:27:50.160 --> 02:27:55.400]  governments love to exacerbate crises and then pose and offer the solution
[02:27:55.400 --> 02:28:01.640]  and have been caught doing it time and time again shouldn't they be the prime
[02:28:01.640 --> 02:28:08.600]  suspects here that's the question now this is a short segment we're gonna go
[02:28:08.600 --> 02:28:16.240]  to break and come back and go to David Jim Michael Jake actually first is even
[02:28:16.240 --> 02:28:19.840]  on the longest and then Donald we're gonna get to all of you after this break
[02:28:19.840 --> 02:28:24.720]  and then I will get to all the news I have not yet covered and there is quite
[02:28:24.720 --> 02:28:29.120]  a bit of it quite a bit of it on the economy and what's happening in the
[02:28:29.120 --> 02:28:33.240]  Middle East we're also going to be looking at some of the latest things that
[02:28:33.240 --> 02:28:41.560]  old old Mitt Romney is up to I did get the latest issue of military press that's
[02:28:41.560 --> 02:28:45.920]  published in Southern California and is it camp Pendleton there's the cover of
[02:28:45.920 --> 02:28:50.360]  it if you're watching on prisonplanet.tv got some great made in America
[02:28:50.360 --> 02:28:55.840]  hardware they're on the cover of it and indeed I did find the articles that
[02:28:55.840 --> 02:29:02.920]  that the caller was talking about where they talk about the commander-in-chief
[02:29:03.040 --> 02:29:09.680]  being involved in unconstitutional activity they're talking about how do
[02:29:09.680 --> 02:29:14.840]  you legalize illegal aliens when the president can't act unilaterally that's
[02:29:14.840 --> 02:29:25.720]  the publisher they've got articles in here about the United Nations and the
[02:29:25.720 --> 02:29:30.600]  takeover so yeah the fact that you haven't heard a controversy about this
[02:29:30.600 --> 02:29:34.280]  being on the base shows that they're starting to understand what's happening
[02:29:34.280 --> 02:29:37.960]  because listen the criminals the enemy the globalists they took over the

[02:33:41.160 --> 02:33:46.080]  through some very important news the big drug companies the same ones who've
[02:33:46.080 --> 02:33:49.200]  all been caught selling drugs they know don't treat what they say and that they
[02:33:49.200 --> 02:33:52.880]  kill you or giving you vaccines that actually give you what they say it's
[02:33:52.880 --> 02:33:57.840]  fighting knowingly to spread it to then scare others to take the shots they now
[02:33:57.840 --> 02:34:02.800]  we're pushing to put kids on oxy cotton the stuff that made Rush Limbaugh go
[02:34:02.800 --> 02:34:10.080]  deaf and they're trying to at the same time make children take their deadly
[02:34:10.080 --> 02:34:15.960]  vaccines we're gonna be breaking all of that down here in just a moment but
[02:34:15.960 --> 02:34:20.840]  right now let's go to David in Canada then we'll go to Jake and others you're
[02:34:20.840 --> 02:34:27.600]  on the air welcome hey Alex how you doing pretty good my friend I got a few
[02:34:27.600 --> 02:34:35.480]  comments I recently lived in Pennsylvania Lebanon County and during the
[02:34:35.480 --> 02:34:42.000]  Obama elections I had decided to leave because I did not want to be ruled by a
[02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:49.800]  communist one of the things I did I had moved to Canada and with this new
[02:34:49.800 --> 02:34:58.880]  healthcare passing I have a message for all Americans don't bother leaving don't
[02:34:58.880 --> 02:35:06.360]  don't bother leaving America now because the IRS has it if you owe any debt you
[02:35:06.360 --> 02:35:13.160]  can't leave if you come to a doctor up here they're gonna tell you to Google it
[02:35:13.160 --> 02:35:19.200]  you don't even get an appointment you you did not get a doctor's appointment the
[02:35:19.200 --> 02:35:25.040]  doctor tells you to Google it oh I've seen this new spam on our YouTube
[02:35:25.040 --> 02:35:30.240]  channel and an info works calm or they say you know in a socialist system there's
[02:35:30.240 --> 02:35:36.280]  a hundred percent unemployment I'm having a Freudian slip there is a hundred
[02:35:36.280 --> 02:35:41.120]  percent employment and everything is wonderful and they actually believe this
[02:35:41.120 --> 02:35:46.640]  they are like oh the Soviet Union Communist China they have no idea because
[02:35:46.640 --> 02:35:52.400]  they're taught in public school and in college the socialism and communism is a
[02:35:52.400 --> 02:35:58.640]  good thing it's amazing they're just help us a little morons I had married a
[02:35:58.640 --> 02:36:09.040]  Canadian girl and she waited 18 months 18 months just for a test for carpal
[02:36:09.040 --> 02:36:17.080]  tunnel another thing I will I want to make a comment to all your listeners like
[02:36:17.080 --> 02:36:21.600]  I said I'm American born I lived in Lebanon County Pennsylvania right by
[02:36:21.600 --> 02:36:25.600]  Hershey Pennsylvania where they made the candy thought they may get in Mexico now
[02:36:25.600 --> 02:36:34.840]  pal and I'll tell you what Alex I am appalled at how do you I don't know how
[02:36:34.840 --> 02:36:38.840]  to say it but I cannot understand why I know why you're distracted I know why
[02:36:38.840 --> 02:36:45.320]  you're distracted somebody just turn the radio on nation on earth why the
[02:36:45.320 --> 02:36:52.960]  citizens of United States are not standing up and saying no I don't get it
[02:36:52.960 --> 02:36:57.560]  all I hear you because if somebody's wearing a uniform I'm convinced if
[02:36:57.560 --> 02:37:00.960]  somebody in a uniform told the average American stick your baby in a garbage
[02:37:00.960 --> 02:37:06.400]  disposal they would salute and say yes sir and do it I mean they America is the
[02:37:06.400 --> 02:37:12.720]  opposite of how it was founded now the average person is a posing mindless
[02:37:12.720 --> 02:37:20.400]  jellyfish now that's not everybody but they're about 50% and the other 50% it
[02:37:20.400 --> 02:37:26.000]  runs the gamut and I'm not trying to be negative here it's just very scary what
[02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:29.400]  people have turned into but let me mention one news article before I go
[02:37:29.400 --> 02:37:34.360]  back to your calls here it is right here the caller called in in the last hour
[02:37:34.360 --> 02:37:40.560]  about this it's a military press big free periodical publication in Southern
[02:37:40.560 --> 02:37:45.200]  California this is on the base at Camp Pendleton it's targeting veterans and
[02:37:45.200 --> 02:37:50.920]  current active duty and I have had a chance to read over this now and it
[02:37:50.920 --> 02:37:59.000]  sounds like Alex Jones wrote half the articles all hail Emperor Obama and then
[02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:02.920]  it goes over the fact that he says the UN runs our military and that world
[02:38:02.920 --> 02:38:06.960]  government is good and that he can shut down our power plants if he feels like
[02:38:06.960 --> 02:38:13.600]  it and then he can do whatever he wants there you go and the whole magazine is
[02:38:13.600 --> 02:38:20.640]  like that well it does have the retro pin-up girls from World War two with
[02:38:20.640 --> 02:38:29.400]  modern modern little God's creations there I but I actually read that's why
[02:38:29.400 --> 02:38:33.760]  we miss the music that's that's why I but I read military press for the
[02:38:33.760 --> 02:38:41.520]  articles okay that's enough all right ladies and gentlemen continuing here
[02:38:41.520 --> 02:38:47.920]  with the news look it is time to stop complying with it all when you go to the
[02:38:47.920 --> 02:38:52.720]  airport and some TSA person wants to grope you dress them down say good call
[02:38:52.720 --> 02:38:56.920]  the cops get there an hour and a half early make a whole ordeal out of it
[02:38:56.920 --> 02:39:00.600]  stand up to them when people his said she would say they're just doing their
[02:39:00.600 --> 02:39:05.160]  job what doing their job to destroy the country doing their job they're on the
[02:39:05.160 --> 02:39:11.080]  highways now you idiot and again it's not just the TSA it's all of it stop
[02:39:11.080 --> 02:39:15.880]  acting like their heroes and we're in a war zone and you got to do it because
[02:39:15.880 --> 02:39:21.600]  Al Qaeda is hiding under the table this is all being done because we've been
[02:39:21.600 --> 02:39:25.480]  taken over by foreign mega banks and I'm going back to the calls but guys go to
[02:39:25.480 --> 02:39:29.800]  that clip since you found it this is from four years ago during the campaign
[02:39:29.800 --> 02:39:35.560]  the reason I raise this is the Secret Service is now being dispatched to
[02:39:35.560 --> 02:39:40.000]  people that criticize Obama a case out of Florida they had a float in the
[02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:45.600]  community parade calling Obama unabomination locals called the Secret
[02:39:45.600 --> 02:39:49.320]  Service on them and the media acts like maybe that's a good thing maybe you
[02:39:49.320 --> 02:39:55.160]  shouldn't talk bad about Obama so here is a clip from the news and this
[02:39:55.160 --> 02:39:59.760]  happened nationwide it's happening again this is the authoritarianism we're
[02:39:59.760 --> 02:40:04.760]  dealing with in this country so use the First Amendment or lose it people ask
[02:40:04.760 --> 02:40:09.320]  why I'm saying get our fliers calling Obama a dictator and post them
[02:40:09.320 --> 02:40:14.080]  everywhere because he's trying to become one and if he doesn't get in trouble
[02:40:14.080 --> 02:40:18.840]  for this it will set the precedent for the next puppet president here is that
[02:40:18.840 --> 02:40:23.440]  clip senator Barack Obama's presidential campaign is asking Missouri law
[02:40:23.440 --> 02:40:28.720]  enforcement to target anyone who lies or runs a misleading television ad during
[02:40:28.720 --> 02:40:31.880]  the presidential campaign this was john mills is live at the county election
[02:40:31.880 --> 02:40:35.160]  board in maple what he's been learning more about which members of law school
[02:40:35.160 --> 02:40:38.520]  law enforcement are getting involved in this John tell us more about this
[02:40:38.520 --> 02:40:42.920]  Russell good evening prosecutors and sheriffs from across Missouri are
[02:40:42.920 --> 02:40:47.280]  joining something called the Barack Obama truth squad two high-profile
[02:40:47.280 --> 02:40:51.560]  prosecutors are part of the team we met them this afternoon in the central
[02:40:51.560 --> 02:40:55.960]  west and they are Jennifer Joyce from the city Bob McCullough the st. Louis
[02:40:55.960 --> 02:41:00.440]  County prosecuting attorney they will be reminding voters that Barack Obama is a
[02:41:00.440 --> 02:41:04.600]  Christian who wants to cut taxes for anyone making less than two hundred
[02:41:04.600 --> 02:41:09.760]  fifty thousand dollars a year they also say they plan to respond immediately to
[02:41:09.760 --> 02:41:16.040]  any ads and statements that might violate Missouri ethics laws we want to
[02:41:16.040 --> 02:41:20.520]  keep this campaign focused on issues we don't want people to get distracted and

[02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:22.680]  your comments on the man and the woman who like you're in the boat with like
[02:48:22.680 --> 02:48:26.360]  they just seem like they didn't even know where they're at like how serious the
[02:48:26.360 --> 02:48:32.920]  Grove is and well here's the deal I I agreed to be on that TV show and so it's
[02:48:32.920 --> 02:48:40.000]  not very friendly or professional to break bread with people and talk about
[02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:44.720]  about them but that's who they selected for the show was just average Joe
[02:48:44.720 --> 02:48:52.040]  Schmoes Sally soccer mom Joe six-pack and they were interviewing me at a
[02:48:52.040 --> 02:49:00.920]  theater there in the the little town of Monterey and I'm like they had a bar

[02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:10.120]  theater thought because they rented the whole thing and the guy basically told

[02:55:02.160 --> 02:55:07.200]  Creek machine gun shoot from Michigan was the leader of this little militia
[02:55:07.200 --> 02:55:10.920]  they're like you know the feds like what do we do they try to confiscate the
[02:55:10.920 --> 02:55:15.360]  guns and have martial law and collapse everything and come to kill us well I
[02:55:15.360 --> 02:55:19.640]  guess we may have to fight then I mean that's declaration of independence
[02:55:19.640 --> 02:55:24.440]  boom all arrested all fake and that federal judge is gonna get a lot of
[02:55:24.440 --> 02:55:27.520]  trouble now because they weren't a total criminal and the judge just said
[02:55:27.520 --> 02:55:32.080]  release them now they still kept to because they could say the guns were
[02:55:32.080 --> 02:55:37.440]  fully auto as if you just can't go get a tax stamp for that everybody
[02:55:37.440 --> 02:55:42.040]  obsesses over full auto I don't want full auto they ever come grab one of my
[02:55:42.040 --> 02:55:46.040]  guns and make it full auto to put me in jail I mean what a joke the point is is
[02:55:46.040 --> 02:55:49.360]  that the news doesn't even know what they're talking about this Jason Fields
[02:55:49.360 --> 02:55:54.200]  is probably three years old it says that Indiana militiamen gets back as 41
[02:55:54.200 --> 02:55:58.600]  guns and they keep calling them machine guns but fully auto and then it goes and
[02:55:58.600 --> 02:56:01.680]  admits two of them have been charged with machine guns he wouldn't be getting
[02:56:01.680 --> 02:56:05.200]  them back if they were machine guns he had illegally and they call them
[02:56:05.200 --> 02:56:09.360]  implements of destruction but when the drones are above us that's a good thing
[02:56:09.360 --> 02:56:16.960]  though right and admitted militiamen oh so evil basically that's just the term
[02:56:16.960 --> 02:56:21.760]  for civil defense got 41 guns and more than a hundred thousand rands of
[02:56:21.760 --> 02:56:24.720]  ammunition back from the government Friday see it shouldn't be about why
[02:56:24.720 --> 02:56:31.160]  was an innocent guy set up the guns were confiscated when Thomas Pedeck and six
[02:56:31.160 --> 02:56:35.040]  other members of Atari militia were arrested no nine on charges they plan
[02:56:35.040 --> 02:56:39.840]  to kill police officers and overthrow the government he was acquitted in March
[02:56:39.840 --> 02:56:42.960]  when a federal judge Victoria Roberts found there was insufficient evidence in
[02:56:42.960 --> 02:56:47.360]  the case Pyec and others then petition to get their weapons back the
[02:56:47.360 --> 02:56:53.480]  implements of destruction oh which are clear to AK-47s to semi-auto handguns
[02:56:53.480 --> 02:56:59.600]  shotguns crossbows and swords required two trips to take home according to TV
[02:56:59.600 --> 02:57:05.880]  station WLS when Pyec arrived to pick up his property from the Hammond Indiana
[02:57:05.880 --> 02:57:10.000]  police station he was already packing heat oh it's so horrible he had a gun
[02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:13.640]  we should all start carrying guns just to let all these government servants know
[02:57:13.640 --> 02:57:17.280]  who the boss is see they want to run TV ads and have billboards up that say
[02:57:17.280 --> 02:57:21.560]  reporting legal guns with an image of a revolver and then the carpet cleaners
[02:57:21.560 --> 02:57:25.360]  in your house and sees a gun case and calls the cops on you that happened to
[02:57:25.360 --> 02:57:33.080]  me I mean that's how mentally ill and dumb the public is I mean just some
[02:57:33.080 --> 02:57:46.840]  fucking some thumb sucking thumb sucking mindless idiots I just get so
[02:57:46.840 --> 02:57:51.120]  disgusted with people I can't even pronounce the words right and it just
[02:57:51.120 --> 02:57:55.280]  goes on just a piece you know whatever he said according WLS you've got a phone
[02:57:55.280 --> 02:58:01.400]  keys wherever it ain't a thing with me and it goes on he also got back military
[02:58:01.400 --> 02:58:06.760]  helmets bulletproof vest $100 in cash and a cell phone and it goes on to
[02:58:06.760 --> 02:58:13.520]  basically demonizing so government arming to the teeth with giant tanks
[02:58:13.520 --> 02:58:19.960]  weapons all these systems surveilling us illegally that's good that's safety even
[02:58:19.960 --> 02:58:23.520]  though historically that's the main danger but you get citizens trying to
[02:58:23.520 --> 02:58:28.720]  counterbalance that that's bad hey I agree with the government it's bad for
[02:58:28.720 --> 02:58:32.400]  us to own guns I think it's good foreign banks brag they've taken over
[02:58:32.400 --> 02:58:37.200]  America and are preparing to bankrupt us to consolidate and take it over I think
[02:58:37.200 --> 02:58:54.200]  that's a good thing we should all worship government thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN live.com today
