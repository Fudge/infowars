[00:00.000 --> 00:14.120]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.120 --> 00:38.680]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen thank you
[00:38.680 --> 00:46.520]  so much for joining us on another live worldwide edition of the Alex Jones show and it is Friday
[00:46.520 --> 00:52.200]  I mean the weeks now go by like minutes and we're going to have open phones on Obamacare
[00:52.840 --> 00:58.760]  on the state of the world the state of the awakening that's taking place but also there's
[00:58.760 --> 01:04.360]  not just those that are waking up there's those that are buying into anything and everything and
[01:04.360 --> 01:11.160]  psychologically what we're seeing happen here is the social engineers are really rolling out
[01:11.160 --> 01:18.040]  their paradigm of control of authoritarianism masquerading as political correctness and so we
[01:18.040 --> 01:23.880]  have a lot of examples of that today huge NSA developments and news will give you the story
[01:23.880 --> 01:30.520]  behind the story the news behind the news on that a bunch of key economic numbers and Obamacare
[01:30.520 --> 01:35.960]  facts coming out and some really good news why we fight why we stand up why we get involved
[01:37.080 --> 01:43.800]  the psych warfare folks out there have some memes that they put out as talking points in the
[01:43.800 --> 01:49.480]  corporate state-run media that have been picked up by the general public that oh you're always
[01:49.480 --> 01:53.720]  saying we're in a police state or you're always saying you know there's great tyrannies around
[01:53.720 --> 02:00.760]  the corner and why don't you shut up it isn't that bad whereas we hold back a lot of it and so
[02:00.760 --> 02:06.280]  then they say oh it's not as bad as you say or or all these horrible things didn't happen because
[02:06.280 --> 02:14.200]  we're fighting them off at every front when you stand up against the authoritarianism of saying
[02:14.200 --> 02:21.000]  your child can't come uh on you know the last day of school before Halloween dress like a cowboy or
[02:21.000 --> 02:28.040]  as an Indian and and when you point out that's political correctness and mind control you are
[02:28.040 --> 02:34.120]  stopping their cultural tyranny when you don't roll over to a 21 taking over your local town with
[02:34.120 --> 02:38.840]  international regulations and money you are fighting on the front lines of human liberty
[02:38.840 --> 02:43.880]  when you defend the second amendment you're having a victory and it's an eternal fight you've got to
[02:43.880 --> 02:55.240]  do it over and over and over and over again so that's what it comes down to and here's
[02:55.240 --> 03:03.640]  another example of a victory against tyranny it's up on info wars dot com right now army
[03:03.640 --> 03:15.720]  halts program that labeled christians radical extremist briefings characterized conservatives
[03:15.720 --> 03:22.200]  as a terror threat well again you cannot come up with a headline as bad as this these manuals
[03:22.200 --> 03:29.160]  actually are it says you'll be arrested in court marshal if you give money to any tea party group
[03:29.160 --> 03:35.960]  all legal and lawful and it says you'll be arrested if you're part of a tea party or
[03:35.960 --> 03:42.840]  a evangelical christian group evangelicals are the second or third largest group you can debate
[03:42.840 --> 03:48.040]  that i looked up the numbers they're the second or third largest christian group 80 of americans
[03:48.040 --> 03:53.480]  characterize themselves as christians you're talking about 40 to 60 to 70 no one knows the
[03:53.480 --> 04:00.840]  actual numbers over 40 million people who are the most law-abiding loving good people on average no
[04:00.840 --> 04:10.920]  one denies that and they're saying they're bad people and you'll be arrested this is 200 proof
[04:10.920 --> 04:18.200]  tyranny this is the essence over the top i mean all they can do after this is start arresting christians
[04:18.200 --> 04:25.960]  that's all they can do is go back to roam throwing us to the lions it is maximum evil
[04:27.080 --> 04:32.760]  and it's totally naked but the good news is they tried this nationwide now they're gonna have to
[04:32.760 --> 04:36.920]  back off but we're not going to stop we want investigations we want congressional hearings
[04:37.960 --> 04:43.560]  we're going to use their offensive to try to sneak in and get ready for a purge of christians
[04:43.560 --> 04:47.000]  and we're going to shoot it right back in their face like judo and throw them right through the
[04:47.000 --> 04:52.760]  political wall they came to attack us we're going to step aside stick our foot out and trip them
[04:52.760 --> 04:57.880]  and watch them go right down the stairs to break their political necks that's info war

[09:00.040 --> 09:16.600]  edition wide open phones the entire three hours 800 259 92 31 800 259 92 31 i am a testimony to what
[09:16.600 --> 09:24.280]  you can do fighting against tyranny incrementally over time like the water torture example the
[09:24.280 --> 09:29.400]  globalists know this they do things over time always pushing never giving up when they're defeated
[09:29.400 --> 09:34.600]  regrouping coming back that's why you have to have a spirit of victory a spirit of resistance
[09:34.600 --> 09:39.400]  a spirit of honor and it doesn't mean any of us are perfect we're all flesh and blood
[09:40.280 --> 09:46.360]  imperfect vessels but we've got to ask god to lead god and direct us to go up against the globalist
[09:46.360 --> 09:52.520]  and we will prevail in the end ladies and gentlemen and it is the great animating contest of liberty
[09:52.520 --> 10:00.280]  versus tyranny that is what we were born to do it is the animating contest of liberty that fulfills
[10:00.280 --> 10:09.560]  that energizes that expands horizons the raw search for hedonistic enjoyment leads towards
[10:09.560 --> 10:17.720]  arachn ruin and i'm not up here as some you know hypocrite lecturing people believe me i know i know
[10:18.840 --> 10:25.240]  and there's balance in everything but we are an incredibly unbalanced society hurtling towards
[10:25.240 --> 10:31.960]  corruption believing that more corruption more decadence will fulfill us when it will not it is
[10:31.960 --> 10:40.680]  purity and honesty and strength in the final equation that is fulfilling whole free number to

[10:58.120 --> 11:06.200]  25 9 9 2 3 1 but i want to direct radio listeners to info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[11:09.240 --> 11:14.920]  to a article on the site army halts program that labeled christians radical extremists
[11:16.760 --> 11:27.640]  now this is extremely extremely extremely good news because remember just at last year
[11:27.640 --> 11:33.880]  when when this was coming out in the manuals republic the corporate controlled decepticon
[11:33.880 --> 11:39.320]  press would say it didn't exist then earlier this year they said okay it does exist and we will
[11:39.880 --> 11:46.920]  arrest you and court martial you if you proselytize even when you're not on duty well that's your
[11:46.920 --> 11:50.600]  free speech they don't care if you go get drunk or they don't care if you want to organize an
[11:50.600 --> 11:57.080]  occult ceremony they do on the basis no no it's christianity solely they're going after it's always
[11:57.080 --> 12:03.160]  the enemy of authoritarians because it makes a god above the state and it doesn't fit in with the
[12:03.160 --> 12:09.080]  whole state run uh system historically that's why from hitler to the romans they attack christians
[12:09.880 --> 12:16.520]  army halts program that labeled christians radical extremists look at how the communist
[12:16.520 --> 12:21.400]  and the soviets went after christians and this is how it all begins political correctness first
[12:21.400 --> 12:27.400]  don't be racist then don't use words like this then don't criticize the government then uh don't
[12:27.400 --> 12:33.240]  talk about your religion on the street uh proselytizing is illegal then don't do it your own church
[12:33.240 --> 12:37.480]  then you can't have your church then we're going to arrest you if you don't renounce it then we're
[12:37.480 --> 12:43.960]  going to arrest you even if you do renounce it they have found families this year and a few
[12:43.960 --> 12:50.200]  decades ago as well they found another wave living in Siberia for more than 50 years multi-generational
[12:50.200 --> 12:57.640]  who can't even hardly talk anymore living hundreds of miles from humans who were the children of
[12:57.640 --> 13:04.040]  christians that fled linen and stale in fact you could just search the smithsonian reporter on a
[13:04.040 --> 13:10.120]  few months ago just incredible article because anthropologists and archaeologists have gone
[13:10.120 --> 13:17.720]  back to where they lived and they survived off of a bag of seeds they ran away with to build a plant
[13:17.720 --> 13:25.560]  small crops hidden this is what it's like folks they killed of the 80 plus million in china
[13:25.560 --> 13:31.320]  most of them were christians they exterminated with pleasure under cia directives almost every
[13:31.320 --> 13:37.960]  christian in china again the globalists have been in control for a long time and in compartmentalized
[13:37.960 --> 13:44.120]  operations they could double cross put malin and then give him his marching orders just like they
[13:44.120 --> 13:50.520]  did with the kemer rouge and went after christians and others in cambodia in the name of anti-communist
[13:50.520 --> 13:58.760]  just like they fund anti christian groups uh everywhere libyan egypt syria the globalist
[13:58.760 --> 14:03.400]  want to exterminate christians and they don't care if you're protestant they don't care if you are
[14:03.400 --> 14:08.760]  catholic they don't care if you are orthodox for some reason if you're orthodox they really want
[14:08.760 --> 14:15.480]  you dead and they will hunt you down and they will kill you and the average cia clerk working at
[14:15.480 --> 14:19.480]  lanley virginia thinks they're fighting for christianity and fighting for liberty meanwhile
[14:19.480 --> 14:24.760]  the globalists get a christian community alone they will fund a group to murder them it's not even
[14:24.760 --> 14:32.520]  the cia it is criminal groups within these agencies using the secrecy of the agencies to do whatever
[14:32.520 --> 14:37.160]  they want and if they are not of the devil they might as well be i mean they're certainly following
[14:37.160 --> 14:43.560]  that archetype to hunt down christians now if you're some glitterbug tinkerbell fake preacher
[14:43.560 --> 14:47.400]  saying worship government you can have a big megachurch they love you you'll be infregard
[14:47.400 --> 14:50.040]  you'll be clergy response team you'll have an fbi card in your wallet
[14:53.560 --> 15:00.760]  but if you're a real christian they they want to end your life conversion isn't enough to the new
[15:00.760 --> 15:08.760]  world order religion and they'll use anybody to kill you animus muslims mercenaries they don't care
[15:08.760 --> 15:16.120]  everywhere they kill the christians they go after the christians it's it's undoubtable it's incontrovertible
[15:16.920 --> 15:25.480]  it is a fact worldwide that the spirit of this world does not like the idea of jesus christ
[15:25.480 --> 15:30.600]  and you can ask yourself as an agnostic or an atheist you know why that is if you don't believe
[15:30.600 --> 15:38.280]  in god my point is that regardless the ideas in the bible in the new testament particularly scare
[15:39.000 --> 15:46.920]  tyrants to death so in america our top story today is that the secretary of the army came out
[15:46.920 --> 15:53.080]  and released the memo it's linked on fox news and on reuters they officially came out and released
[15:53.080 --> 15:57.800]  and it's the secretary of the army said this is uh outrageous and will no longer be done
[15:59.160 --> 16:04.520]  so there you go it is confirmed this is going on now we already know what's going on we have the
[16:04.520 --> 16:11.320]  training manuals we've had well they haven't hidden it psyops at ford hood gave us the information
[16:11.320 --> 16:21.400]  last year you know why it seems to always be psyops that keeps resisting inside the pentagon
[16:21.400 --> 16:27.320]  because psyops knows propaganda and knows manipulation and they recognize what's being used on them
[16:29.880 --> 16:37.560]  number one group awake probably 90 psyops special warfare 80 non-commissioned officers 70 percent
[16:37.560 --> 16:44.520]  or more are awake enlisted around 50 percent and and it's exponentially growing the best news i can
[16:44.520 --> 16:49.480]  give you here ladies and gentlemen is that the military that the globalist want to use against
[16:49.480 --> 16:56.520]  us is the most awake group in triplicate overwhelmingly undoubtedly just absolutely
[16:57.560 --> 17:01.800]  it is a blessing that this is the case and that's why the globalists knew this five years ago
[17:01.800 --> 17:06.840]  they knew it was their only main threat one of the dominant threats the the prime threat to their
[17:06.840 --> 17:15.000]  takeover that's why they said returning veterans christian veterans christian soldiers are our enemy
[17:15.000 --> 17:21.400]  because they know you're not going to take part in evil ladies and gentlemen they know
[17:21.400 --> 17:26.280]  that when the rubber hits the road you're going to resist the new world order takeover of the
[17:26.280 --> 17:31.560]  republic and so you're their enemy whether you like it or not folks they know what's written on
[17:31.560 --> 17:38.600]  your heart they can see your soul the devil that the spirit of this world has come to attack you
[17:38.600 --> 17:45.800]  and wage war on you and probably in the final equation overcome you but only for a season
[17:45.800 --> 17:52.040]  out of that will become the greatest revival the world has ever seen and we're here to stand
[17:52.040 --> 17:58.440]  watchman and to warn what's coming in the cashless society the world government the b system undoubtedly
[17:58.440 --> 18:03.480]  it's all being set up the problem is these controlled globalist preachers come out on purpose
[18:03.480 --> 18:09.000]  and say crisis coming back next week next month next year set these dates to discredit things by
[18:09.000 --> 18:15.640]  design these are globalist operatives whether they know it or not but you don't just go to the church
[18:15.640 --> 18:21.000]  and hide your head in the sand and say oh good you know it's you know the mark of the beast is coming
[18:21.000 --> 18:26.440]  down the road so i'll just go have fun and enjoy myself you should be out there and warning everyone
[18:26.440 --> 18:32.600]  about the mega banks about the 10 global regions you know the bible says 10 regions 10 kings that
[18:32.600 --> 18:37.800]  give their power to the world king that comes the globalist set it up under 10 kingdoms the un calls
[18:37.800 --> 18:44.760]  it 10 kingdoms the people at the un believe lucifer is christ and they're trying to bring him in
[18:44.760 --> 18:50.120]  that's what atheists don't get i've snuck into behemian grove i've covered skull and bones i've
[18:50.120 --> 18:55.800]  researched it i've met top globalists and they say yes you're right my family are luciferians
[18:55.800 --> 19:00.920]  we believe lucifer is christ he's coming but i don't believe he's christ i believe he's the devil
[19:00.920 --> 19:05.720]  and that's why i want to say we're not all bad alex we are slaves of the system what do we do
[19:07.720 --> 19:13.160]  so whether god and the devil are real or not this human art type and i just say that so there's no
[19:13.160 --> 19:20.280]  debate whether the god and the devil are real or not you know wickedness and evil exist in the
[19:20.280 --> 19:25.320]  world you know goodness exist you know ugliness and beauty exists you know freedom and slavery
[19:25.320 --> 19:31.560]  exist and the god of this world the people running things are not atheists and agnostics
[19:31.560 --> 19:38.280]  they worship the spirit of light tony blair on record says i worship the angel of light folks
[19:38.280 --> 19:44.280]  that is a direct quote the angel of light is lucifer that's what it means luminescence light
[19:45.240 --> 19:52.040]  the false light of lucifer i didn't mean to get off into that but the good news when we come back
[19:52.040 --> 19:56.920]  is that we force this out in the open the pentagon had to admit it was going on and says
[19:56.920 --> 20:02.360]  they're stopping it but we've got to keep pushing it when we come back are you prepared for disasters

[26:35.880 --> 26:41.480]  our culture shutting down our industry attacking our morals going over their entire program
[26:42.440 --> 26:47.080]  of control manipulation do me a favor give me the communist goals that came out in congress

[26:52.440 --> 26:57.960]  read this from the 50s then ask me if it hasn't come through and the point is is that
[26:58.840 --> 27:04.600]  still we're trying to hold up the main walls from the main assault and the enemies walking around
[27:04.600 --> 27:09.560]  inside going there's nothing behind those walls but liberty and freedom don't listen to people
[27:09.560 --> 27:17.480]  there's nothing bad as a giant rock flies over micatopolton crushes people as we see the jobs
[27:17.480 --> 27:23.560]  lost the families imploding our health being lost as we see the tyranny increasing as we
[27:23.560 --> 27:30.280]  see the nsa spying the secret arrest the war on the press the war on the family it's all intensifying
[27:30.280 --> 27:34.440]  and they're saying there's nothing going on hey look at this army manual saying christianity
[27:34.440 --> 27:39.240]  will basically be banned and returning veterans of the number one terror threat that doesn't exist
[27:39.240 --> 27:45.720]  that's not real and we force it out in the mainstream then they have to respond then there's a debate
[27:45.720 --> 27:52.120]  about it and people go wow you're authoritarians that sounds like russia saying uh you can't be
[27:52.120 --> 27:56.120]  part of a christian group that sounds like russia saying you can't be part of a mainline
[27:56.680 --> 28:01.080]  tea party with one of the lowest crime rates out there totally legal lawful groups trying to
[28:01.080 --> 28:07.640]  make illegal by fiat totally mainline organizations even radical organizations should be protected
[28:07.640 --> 28:14.120]  as long as they don't do anything illegal under the first amendment wow you're really really really
[28:14.120 --> 28:22.280]  really dangerous you see we're now taking their attacks and trying to get us just to accept okay
[28:22.280 --> 28:28.200]  we can't pack lunches for our kids anymore okay calling yourself father and mother is racist against
[28:28.200 --> 28:34.680]  gay people see now it's not tolerance towards gay people now you being a father or mother you being
[28:34.680 --> 28:41.640]  straight that hurts them see it's not about tolerance it's about adoption and the globalists
[28:41.640 --> 28:46.920]  don't even care about gay stuff and all that it's about attacking the dominant culture and getting
[28:46.920 --> 28:51.880]  you to accept anything they want and that the state is the mommy and the daddy which is officially
[28:51.880 --> 28:57.400]  taught in public schools nationwide but here's the article info wars dot com army halts program
[28:57.400 --> 29:04.680]  that labeled christians radical extremist the secretary of the army has halted training programs
[29:04.680 --> 29:09.000]  that characterize conservatives as radical extremists in light of numerous media reports
[29:09.000 --> 29:12.920]  which highlighted how recruits were being taught that christians were to be considered domestic
[29:12.920 --> 29:18.520]  hate groups that's a quote and then they train them for war with us on several occasions over
[29:18.520 --> 29:23.320]  the past few months media accounts of highlighted instances of army instructors supplementing programs
[29:23.320 --> 29:28.600]  of instruction southern property law center and including information or material that is inaccurate
[29:28.600 --> 29:34.600]  objectionable and otherwise inconsistent with current army policy army secretary john mckew

[33:51.960 --> 33:57.720]  but this is a big deal and and this is the the model i thank you for joining us alex jones
[33:57.720 --> 34:04.680]  back live here on this friday edition this is the model of defeating them first they deny
[34:04.680 --> 34:10.040]  those fema camps then they deny that they're training to take our guns then they deny that
[34:10.040 --> 34:15.720]  they're training to run checkpoints all over the country and round us up and put us in forced
[34:15.720 --> 34:21.160]  labor camps but we go get all the emergency centers establishment documents the civilian
[34:21.160 --> 34:28.600]  labor camp documents uh all these other program documents freedom from war documents 7277 state
[34:28.600 --> 34:34.840]  apartment random document we get all those documents we show them to people and then the
[34:34.840 --> 34:40.440]  alternative media forces the story out there and then it causes a debate in the military
[34:41.240 --> 34:45.400]  why do you think it's the military that's the most awake i mean there's a lot of reasons
[34:45.400 --> 34:51.480]  but it's because they're actually in there compartmentalized being prepared for this
[34:52.040 --> 34:57.240]  and now they're getting ready to go so operational for a stage civil war in america that they're
[34:57.240 --> 35:04.680]  down to in many units in many areas to the privates preparing them for war with the american people
[35:07.320 --> 35:11.000]  i've been to these urban warfare drills many times and they'll have the press they're going
[35:11.000 --> 35:15.640]  yes we're training to be in iraq or we're training to be in macedonia or we're training for other
[35:15.640 --> 35:20.360]  countries and then you'll go see the drill and the soldiers will even be asking i thought this
[35:20.360 --> 35:25.080]  was for overseas why are these people saying they're from san francisco we're fighting and
[35:25.080 --> 35:30.440]  that they're in a militia and i've actually seen you know the captain go don't worry about that soldier
[35:31.400 --> 35:35.400]  so they'll have a cover story but it's so flimsy
[35:35.400 --> 35:45.240]  it's designed to never even be challenged and so we just ignore their lies ignore their propaganda
[35:45.240 --> 35:51.880]  we bring a flamethrower of truth to these people and burn them alive i mean the truth is like
[35:51.880 --> 35:58.280]  dragons fire to these worms i mean that's why they're so scared of us is that we're honorable we
[35:58.280 --> 36:04.280]  have the truth and good men and women throughout the entire system worldwide care about their kids
[36:04.280 --> 36:11.960]  and don't like criminals and don't like scams and deep down want prosperity and so the military now
[36:12.840 --> 36:18.360]  hurt us for decades and many others warning them about the takeover plan and now it's here
[36:18.360 --> 36:21.800]  and they think obama's they're closer and they want to hurry up and try to do it
[36:23.320 --> 36:28.120]  but now they're not doing it in a vacuum where no one's resisting them everyone's pointing out
[36:28.120 --> 36:33.800]  in media outlets as bigger bigger than state run media that it's the total takeover of society
[36:33.800 --> 36:37.640]  when they say your kids don't belong to you where they're challenging them pointing out
[36:37.640 --> 36:42.680]  it's authoritarianism when they say christians are terrorists and need to be arrested and
[36:42.680 --> 36:47.960]  rounded up and if you are part of their group we're going to arrest you where they're challenging it
[36:48.520 --> 36:55.800]  so if you challenge the over the top bad behavior then it destroys those that are pushing it
[36:55.800 --> 37:00.120]  this is all designed for us just to lay down and accept it and it's not going to happen now
[37:00.120 --> 37:05.480]  now paul watson's written some good articles on this fox news is covered it others have covered it
[37:05.480 --> 37:11.880]  but even fox news and info wars dot com kind of whitewash it because the reality of this is
[37:11.880 --> 37:16.840]  so hardcore it should be 10 times worse the headline is army halts program that labeled
[37:16.840 --> 37:24.360]  christians radical extremists know army halts program threatening to arrest christian members
[37:24.360 --> 37:30.840]  of the military that's what the training manuals that fox news got said
[37:33.720 --> 37:38.120]  oh it said evangelicals or radicals don't be part of them or you'll be court-martialed
[37:38.120 --> 37:42.120]  and don't be part of the any tea party group or give money to any of these groups don't give money
[37:42.120 --> 37:49.400]  to an evangelical church or we will arrest you do i need to say how big that is again i know i
[37:49.400 --> 37:55.080]  keep marveling here because if we just accept the social engineering and have a new normalcy bias
[37:55.080 --> 38:00.600]  to just accept in america they tell us what our kids can eat at school we can't pack lunches they're
[38:00.600 --> 38:04.440]  going to give them inoculations without asking they're going to take 10 year olds to have abortions
[38:04.440 --> 38:09.240]  without asking the parents but you got to have a thing to go to the planetarium of the zoo
[38:10.440 --> 38:15.480]  look how far down the rat hole we already are but if we realize we're under attack and we realize
[38:15.480 --> 38:20.120]  how out of control it is and how bad-mouthing the founding fathers and gun owners and veterans
[38:20.120 --> 38:25.000]  is pure treason and we point out that wait a minute we've got groups that admittedly worship
[38:25.000 --> 38:30.920]  mal seven of the 15 or so czars wait they say they want to put us in labor camps they talk about
[38:30.920 --> 38:36.040]  they talk about martial law sila jackson lee wait a minute we these aren't americans this
[38:36.040 --> 38:43.080]  is a takeover group they want to arrest us for being liberty lovers you want to arrest
[38:43.080 --> 38:48.280]  audi murphy for fighting the nazis no we're going to find out exactly who funds you we know who
[38:48.280 --> 38:54.120]  funds you the big foreign banks on record and we are going to keep exposing you and call for
[38:54.120 --> 38:57.640]  congressional investigations and we're going to take the congress over and the state's over and
[38:57.640 --> 39:02.520]  let me explain what's going to happen to you your leaders are in are going to end up going to prison
[39:02.520 --> 39:09.720]  for this for a plan i'm going to say this again to arrest mainline christians and put them in
[39:09.720 --> 39:17.400]  military breaks i mean again words do not describe the mega magnitude of this and this is what they're
[39:17.400 --> 39:22.200]  trying now because they're getting ready to go operational and start the civil war and have
[39:22.200 --> 39:29.240]  gun owners veterans and christians listed as the enemy and have some type of red terror purge
[39:29.240 --> 39:34.280]  they really believe in their ivory towers up there in dc they're going to get away with this
[39:34.280 --> 39:39.000]  and have it wiped out the military and police in a fight with us and then they roll in with the
[39:39.000 --> 39:45.160]  chai come and and and and and you in world government military in the final equation
[39:46.760 --> 39:52.440]  that's how crazy these people are and they're crazy enough to do it historically that the
[39:52.440 --> 39:59.640]  globalists have done this in russia in china in cuba in africa all over the place in latin america
[39:59.640 --> 40:05.080]  in eastern europe in the middle east they will sit back while we have a decade long civil war
[40:05.080 --> 40:09.880]  war because they want to destroy america let me tell you you think they won't get away with this
[40:10.440 --> 40:16.200]  the plan is to destroy all of us we are with the police and the military and i hope they're
[40:16.200 --> 40:21.720]  listening and i know those that disagree with me are listening i know those that are awake are
[40:21.720 --> 40:28.600]  listening listen you don't want to go down this road mr tough guy you are going to literally
[40:28.600 --> 40:34.520]  get run over and in the process a lot of good people are going to get smashed as well we don't
[40:34.520 --> 40:40.520]  want this the globalists and the collectivist and the communists that are financed by the foreign
[40:40.520 --> 40:48.600]  banks to do this to us plan a major reorganization collectivization sovietization here in america
[40:49.320 --> 40:55.160]  said i go to your phone calls i'm going to them but we don't just stop see for just a few days ago
[40:55.160 --> 40:58.760]  they had the white house mouthpieces media matters and others saying this wasn't real
[40:58.760 --> 41:05.800]  they want to creep around behind the scenes with captured groups like the military and
[41:05.800 --> 41:11.160]  foster kids and public school children and college students people under their control under their
[41:11.160 --> 41:17.720]  big reeducation camp we can turn the military into a reverse reeducation camp and turn it
[41:17.720 --> 41:23.240]  into a liberty camp of waking up and getting out of the camp and returning america we can go into
[41:23.240 --> 41:28.600]  the cancer centers and reprogram with the truth and liberty and common sense that the troops are ready
[41:28.600 --> 41:34.600]  to take in like like like mother's milk instead of poison they're ready to upload our information
[41:34.600 --> 41:39.960]  they were built for it they were made to be free men and women they're ready for us to come and aid
[41:39.960 --> 41:46.600]  them we will go into their attack programs and we will seize it just like operation valkyrie
[41:46.600 --> 41:55.320]  and that failed in 1944 but our program is non-aggressive non-military but we use the
[41:55.320 --> 42:01.320]  military as the growth area for this and it's already been achieved that was always my goal
[42:01.320 --> 42:05.560]  that i didn't have the sophistication to understand all the different facets i just knew it was key
[42:06.200 --> 42:09.960]  to wake up the military and the police because they're the enforcement arm but because they're
[42:09.960 --> 42:14.760]  the group prepared for war with us while they watch the establishment media say they weren't
[42:14.760 --> 42:20.920]  being prepared for it they know they're being lied to and the mission is evil and foreign and corrupt
[42:20.920 --> 42:28.680]  and traitorous and evil now what is operation valkyrie it is a martial law takeover system that
[42:28.680 --> 42:36.360]  the hitler set up which then members of the general staff were able to reverse jack and try to turn
[42:36.360 --> 42:43.880]  against hitler it failed but the point is what i'm telling you is we can use the entire system
[42:43.880 --> 42:49.560]  they've already set up not to go take out the illegitimate government we will use the fact
[42:49.560 --> 42:55.720]  that they've set up a valkyrie program against us but that that traitorous valkyrie program
[42:55.720 --> 43:02.280]  against the republic is the proof and the confession of the treason by the globalist you
[43:02.280 --> 43:07.640]  understand this that they would come out and openly say all evangelicals are terrorists
[43:07.640 --> 43:13.960]  and the enemy and you'll be arrested if you're one they went to total soviet level evil in front
[43:13.960 --> 43:22.280]  of the entire military 100 convicted that they are enemy infiltrators do you understand that
[43:22.280 --> 43:31.480]  ladies and gentlemen and again apolitano four years ago thursday april 16 2009 stood by her
[43:31.480 --> 43:38.040]  report in the associated press in the washington times instead christians and returning vets
[43:38.040 --> 43:45.320]  are the terror enemy not al-qaeda the troops though are busy they didn't go look this up
[43:45.320 --> 43:50.440]  they just heard me saying it and thought they'll never say christians are our enemy now they're
[43:50.440 --> 43:55.080]  being taught that and now they were already told by us the enemy's going to come in and do this get
[43:55.080 --> 44:00.280]  ready and then here comes the enemy around the corner like a stampede of traitorous goblins
[44:00.280 --> 44:07.880]  and we are ready for them not flat-footed geared up surging forward worldwide the transmission's
[44:07.880 --> 44:12.760]  out the emergency beacon is blasting some people say my show's a broken record sometimes you bet

[44:33.800 --> 44:40.120]  created them 160 years ago a golden eugenics and i'm just giving you the data points so you can
[44:40.120 --> 44:45.240]  go see it for yourself emergency emergency here's who hit us here's who they are they've taken over

[44:51.000 --> 44:55.640]  government's running al-qaeda yeah right now they publicly run them see and they go al-qaeda in the
[44:55.640 --> 44:59.880]  threat your granddaddy who's a christian's the threat that veteran that vietnam veteran he's
[44:59.880 --> 45:05.000]  the threat well you bet they're the threat to a foreign takeover of course they're a threat to
[45:05.000 --> 45:11.080]  foreign enemies they swore an oath to defend the republic against all enemies foreign and domestic
[45:11.080 --> 45:16.040]  and they need to stand by it but the american people need to stand by it as well i said i'd go
[45:16.040 --> 45:21.720]  to your calls we need congressional investigations on this this they are caught red-handed we need
[45:21.720 --> 45:25.800]  the adl the southern poverty law center that are running all this hauled up before congress
[45:27.400 --> 45:34.520]  who are in our police departments and everything else teaching the police this crap so that
[45:35.160 --> 45:40.120]  anybody that stands on the way of the country being usurped can be arrested these are
[45:40.120 --> 45:47.000]  authoritarians if you want i'm telling you the blueprint is a high-tech version of the 1917 take
[45:47.000 --> 45:51.400]  over in russia folks you better go study that i'm telling you that's their plan that's what they
[45:51.400 --> 45:58.280]  admit they're following we are all in grave danger okay that's all i have to say and if you think
[45:58.280 --> 46:06.440]  cowering to these people is going to protect you you're insane you are insane and by the way the
[46:06.440 --> 46:11.320]  globalist pushing this are destroying themselves as well only a moron would bring something in this
[46:11.320 --> 46:15.720]  evil look at the folks that brought the soviet thing in they had purge after purge of each other
[46:15.720 --> 46:22.040]  for 50 years what a nightmare situation you're creating this is this this this is the most
[46:22.760 --> 46:28.360]  self-destructive action by the elite i could even imagine all right i said to go to your
[46:28.360 --> 46:32.040]  calls we're gonna go to him right now thank you for holding thank you for calling chris sam eric
[46:32.040 --> 46:37.720]  kathleen or kathleen and omar and others you're on the air chris from georgia you're on the air go
[46:37.720 --> 46:44.920]  ahead yeah hi i would say i'm on a i'm on a roof to stop the hammering here um the two little things
[46:44.920 --> 46:50.520]  that i could uh if you could uh get gnome chomsky on the show i've tried to get gnome chomsky on i
[46:50.520 --> 46:55.640]  got him on like 12 14 years ago i forget and he was against the second amendment and i couldn't help
[46:55.640 --> 47:00.360]  blowing up at him i politically agree with him on a lot of his analysis just not on his solutions
[47:00.360 --> 47:05.960]  he is a very smart person but he said that you know using a british model two different cultures
[47:05.960 --> 47:10.920]  that more guns means more crime when statistically in our culture it means lower crime that's
[47:10.920 --> 47:17.880]  incontrovertible now so i blew up at chomsky well i can see that but well it's the reason why is
[47:17.880 --> 47:23.880]  because he's kind of an icon for the left and it could bring a lot of the left into your show
[47:23.880 --> 47:28.600]  i've already sent an email probably five years ago apologizing to chomsky saying i want to do a
[47:28.600 --> 47:34.120]  more professional interview on things we agree with and it'd be a good platform for him to come on
[47:34.120 --> 47:39.800]  so i've already i could have done the interview better i i i apologize for blowing up at him
[47:39.800 --> 47:45.080]  and calling him stupid um but i knew that he was smart enough to know that's two different cultural
[47:45.080 --> 47:51.080]  models and so cultures are different and vary and so it's a side issue just the second amendment's
[47:51.080 --> 47:58.520]  a real hot button for me i think if i could um yeah i'd be good i think if you dwelt upon the
[47:58.520 --> 48:03.000]  irish experience a little more like you know the troubles in the 80s and the ira and all i mean
[48:03.000 --> 48:09.560]  even though you said higher echelons of the ira were in cahoots with the british secret service
[48:10.200 --> 48:16.120]  as far as rebellion i mean it's an incredible model of heroism oh no no i'm not saying that
[48:16.120 --> 48:19.560]  that all the irish rebels were bad people they were incredible people and i admire what they
[48:19.560 --> 48:24.760]  did in their courage the leadership didn't even really have a choice uh you know mi five and the
[48:24.760 --> 48:29.720]  commandos and mi six were killing them if they didn't become double agents so so that's what i'm
[48:29.720 --> 48:35.480]  saying is that that's the problem with any covert operation is it can be threatened or taken over
[48:35.480 --> 48:39.800]  even if your leader is you know messianic it doesn't mind being killed they can still try to
[48:39.800 --> 48:45.880]  decapitate it that's why it has to be leaderless and just an idea that's unstoppable because ideas
[48:45.880 --> 48:50.840]  are bulletproof a friend of mine who i think was you know may have been involved in that stuff but
[48:50.840 --> 48:58.840]  those guys never really talked about it he said that a mere 200 ira snipers closed down the operations
[48:58.840 --> 49:04.600]  of a 35 000 man british army oh yeah i mean if folks think the ira that could barely get weapons
[49:04.600 --> 49:09.160]  i mean one of the most disarmed places in the world for hundreds of years if they thought the ira
[49:09.160 --> 49:15.080]  gave the british regulars trouble can you imagine what a civil war is going to look like with uh
[49:15.080 --> 49:21.880]  the patriots against the the snot-nosed folks that'll engage in treasonous activities
[49:21.880 --> 49:30.040]  yeah yeah and so one real quick uh your lead make is your lead in song the wolf tones the men behind
[49:30.040 --> 49:35.720]  the wire or men behind the wire you know after next break great great inspirational song
[49:36.440 --> 49:40.920]  uh you know about the ira going to get their men out of the british jail yes sir we'll look it up
[49:40.920 --> 49:45.800]  god bless you no no i agree the model of total resistance is the way to go they start trying
[49:45.800 --> 49:50.440]  to arrest us around us up which they're openly saying we're going to put christians in jail
[49:50.440 --> 49:54.840]  we're going to put we're not going to just audit and harass the tea party we're going to put you
[49:54.840 --> 50:03.320]  in jail i mean these are flaming criminals i mean they are outrageously evil people ask why i get
[50:03.320 --> 50:08.680]  upset start yelling when the government starts saying we're going to arrest mainline christians
[50:08.680 --> 50:13.080]  we're going to arrest soldiers that that are part of christian organizations or part of the tea
[50:13.080 --> 50:19.720]  party i mean obama should be impeached and arrested right now i mean if our country had any sense
[50:19.720 --> 50:25.320]  there would be an emergency in congress they would be dragging them in he would at least resign
[50:25.320 --> 50:31.080]  there we would find out who's doing this people would be indicted because you have free speech
[50:31.880 --> 50:35.320]  but you don't have speech to i mean if i wouldn't organize and try to take over
[50:35.960 --> 50:39.480]  and try to say get with my neighbors to go tell my other neighbors will beat you up or put you
[50:39.480 --> 50:44.920]  in jail if you're a christian that would be racketeering but the government does it i mean it
[50:44.920 --> 50:52.840]  is tyranny with a gigantic flaming capital satanic tea the size of the earth i we're going to come

[54:19.320 --> 54:25.400]  who are evangelicals one of the biggest christian groups in the country we're going to arrest you
[54:25.400 --> 54:30.920]  if you give money to the tea party i mean that is racketeering that is organized crime violating
[54:30.920 --> 54:37.480]  somebody's civil rights that's even beyond saying you know black folks aren't allowed to vote or white
[54:37.480 --> 54:44.280]  folks or whatever i mean that's saying you can't even be part of your religion that is just so
[54:44.280 --> 54:51.240]  criminal and again they're not liberals these are authoritarian crux and they love any captured
[54:51.240 --> 54:58.520]  audience school kids military any group they can control any group they can mess with and do social
[54:58.520 --> 55:04.680]  engineering on it's amazing i'm gonna go right back to your phone calls uh let's go ahead and
[55:04.680 --> 55:11.560]  talk to omar uh you're on the air go ahead i know i like um i just want to run through a few quick
[55:11.560 --> 55:17.880]  points and then you can have a new response um first of all i would like to say that how have
[55:17.880 --> 55:27.160]  we gone to a country with a hyper-communist leader whose campaign slogan is a new dawn
[55:28.360 --> 55:35.960]  and who repeatedly discusses socialist ideals like there's no type of big deal well that's right
[55:35.960 --> 55:43.000]  for those that don't know the term forward and capturing the future and uh the new dawn is marxist
[55:43.000 --> 55:51.240]  linonist famous 1917 and then and then other revolutions in the 30s it is direct death squad
[55:51.240 --> 55:56.840]  red terror we're coming to kill everybody talk for all their insiders and we're all going hey
[55:56.840 --> 56:03.480]  i like that obama he's a nice fella that's what i'm telling you this is it definitely my second point
[56:03.480 --> 56:10.200]  is the sovereignty of our nation is being destroyed through the north american union for many purposes
[56:10.200 --> 56:16.600]  one main purpose that i would like to bring up on to the audience is that and canada right now they
[56:16.600 --> 56:24.040]  are eliminating money transfer physical money they are starting to use biometric systems to
[56:24.840 --> 56:32.840]  use for financial um transactions so my thing is i feel like once they set the president
[56:32.840 --> 56:38.920]  that's when obama and his colonies they're going to try to do the same thing they're already trying
[56:38.920 --> 56:43.320]  to implement biometrics in the schools oh they're already doing it listen sir i totally agree with
[56:43.320 --> 56:47.400]  your points everything is on the timetable to implode the world economy they admit this at
[56:47.400 --> 56:53.080]  davos every year and bring in the global s dr is the solution they're in the news now doing it
[56:53.080 --> 56:58.280]  they're going to maneuver us into a global currency you'll still have a regional currency
[56:58.280 --> 57:05.000]  but it's going to be denominated in s dr's in fact the dollar when used international transfers
[57:05.000 --> 57:10.840]  is already denominated uh for shipping and for banking in strategic drawing rights which is
[57:10.840 --> 57:17.320]  an imf world bank aka private federal reserve digital currency the globalists can already
[57:17.320 --> 57:22.920]  make unlimited money for themselves they're just maneuvering us towards bankruptcy into false debt
[57:22.920 --> 57:33.080]  i agree um i have two more points one is about the boston marathon these people in the media are so
[57:33.080 --> 57:40.600]  sloppy that they actually took the picture from the principal sanny hook who they said got killed
[57:40.600 --> 57:47.480]  who they said adam lands are shot and then when the boston marathon happened they put her picture
[57:47.480 --> 57:53.800]  up changed her name a little bit and said that she was a victim of the boston marathon well i know
[57:53.800 --> 57:58.360]  this and god bless you i appreciate your call obviously the white house is watching they're
[57:58.360 --> 58:03.240]  listening they have their front groups right about us daily all i can tell you is sandy hook
[58:03.240 --> 58:08.280]  is very mysterious there is a cover up the state admits there's a cover up of what drugs he was on
[58:08.280 --> 58:13.000]  it was clearly another shooter the whole story is a fraud the boston bombing they had multiple
[58:13.000 --> 58:19.080]  drills going on we confirmed that they ordered to stand down even those taking part in the drills
[58:19.080 --> 58:24.680]  thought that there was a bombing during the drill while the national archives a key national
[58:24.680 --> 58:29.800]  archive area burned down at the same time so they always do other weird stuff definitely a blackoff

[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:55.640]  last night on the nightly news and then i see a comment down here by heroes comment saying alex
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:01:01.160]  jones why don't you talk about the new network shows showing all these new cop shows coming out
[01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:05.240]  where they're all in military gear knocking down people's doors as if they are trying to give us
[01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:11.080]  the perception this is all normal the network tv is doing a number on us with their new programming
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:17.800]  obama propaganda everyone says yes please illegally search my car when i know i have
[01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:24.840]  an old roach in the astray these people are idiots all i've ever talked about is for 20 years at

[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:37.640]  schooler is a criminal any parents that are christian or criminals uh we do reports every
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:43.000]  few months on the nightly news where the cartoons the dramas the cop shows every movie i go see
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:49.640]  that's a drama or cop show cop movie is illegal checkpoints and you know random stuff going on
[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:56.440]  to condition you that it's normal yes yes i know it's part of the total acclimation of the police
[01:01:56.440 --> 01:02:03.080]  and military as well and now they're segwaying into christians are the enemy and gun owners of the
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:09.080]  enemy yes yes we're in trouble and so i do talk about it but people think because i don't talk
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:18.280]  about something in one video that doesn't mean then in every other video i haven't covered it
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:28.520]  there's like this thing where if a video is about one thing then the there must not be any other
[01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:33.400]  videos in the known universe that i've done that covered it it's just a really weird criticism
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:37.640]  i see a lot out there i mean this wasn't even so much a criticism it just becomes a pet peeve
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:41.240]  that why didn't you cover this why didn't you cover that i try to cover as much as i can in fact
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:45.240]  we're gonna go back to your calls come back to them the next segment and i've got to get to news
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:49.240]  for mark dice going just they'll go back into your calls there's a lot of key news coming up
[01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:58.440]  right now let's go to catherine in canada year on the air go ahead hi alex hey how you doing
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:03.880]  hello hey um i have i just have a theory that i want to bounce off you and see what you think
[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:09.320]  it's about obama care and the health care dot gov website and all the security issues around it
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:14.600]  i honestly think they're going to use the security issues with the health care website and scrap it
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:20.440]  and then implement the medical rsid chip stating to the american people that this is the new secure
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:24.120]  way to get health care and that's how they're going to get people to get the chip and i think
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:28.120]  that's why the persecuting christians because we all know that's technically the mark of the beast
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:33.480]  i think that's why the pierce persecuting christians now well that's right no no no that's right
[01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:38.520]  and they actually admit the government releases the social security numbers they they foster the
[01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:46.280]  fraud they foster the fraud so that then when there's identity theft crises they can bring in the
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:51.160]  biometrics bring in the chips bring in the control the head of google said two weeks ago
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:56.440]  we are going to put chips in your brain not just in your body and if it's trendy i mean people will
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:04:01.640]  do it i totally believe that's how i see a commercial for this medical chip but that's
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:04.760]  how they want to keep the information and i think that's what they're doing is they're
[01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:09.400]  going to make the website so corrupt to make people beg for a new secure system and that's
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:13.400]  how they're going to tell people this is the best way to do it this secure way get this medical chip
[01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:17.640]  and everybody has their health care will be fine and i just wonder if you agree or disagree on that
[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:25.240]  ma'am you're absolutely on target i totally and completely agree with you
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:31.160]  and uh the average church will not warn anybody because their government run

[01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:40.520]  there is still a lot of good in the world but there are criminal interests engaged in
[01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:46.760]  scientifically developed high-tech forms of cultural warfare to break down our society
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:55.880]  and turn humanity into human resources the social engineers are our enemy they're not
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:09:00.280]  trying to build a better world that's always creating disasters as well
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:07.880]  they are consciously building an anti-human transhumanist eugenesis world
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:13.880]  in their attempt to play god i want to cover a few news stories and go right back to your phone
[01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:22.360]  calls here is a story out of cns news census bureau means tested government benefit recipients
[01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:34.360]  outnumber full-time year-round workers 108 million people are on the welfare doll one way or another
[01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:38.360]  that's more than all full-time workers and now officially
[01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:47.320]  the federal government is encouraging companies under obama care to lay people off to part time
[01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:53.160]  and then tell them to go get welfare assistance as a supplement and that's what they've done
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:57.480]  with the illegal aliens is they bring them in they work at wages you can't live on and then
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:01.400]  they're given government supplement even though they're here illegally those agencies give it to
[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:07.160]  them and that's been admitted for a long time this is to get everybody dependent cloward and
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:14.760]  piven and they've done it we're now there that's why they're making their move and they're going
[01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:20.040]  to make those of us that produce their slaves and the people living on welfare don't know they'd
[01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:23.960]  have a better life in a true free market they don't know the standard of living is dropped
[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:27.480]  they don't know they're being put on welfare to get control of them so they can be medical
[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:32.760]  guinea pigs and be forced to take vaccines and the rest of it they don't know what eugenics is
[01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:40.680]  they have no idea they're going into slavery we're now crossing the rubicon into the new dawn
[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:48.280]  forward as the communists say under obama slogans so there you go most americas accumulating
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:53.960]  debt faster than they're saving for retirement we're going into debt bondage where the taxes
[01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:59.880]  and the regulations have been set where the the the the mass of the people will be bankrupted
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:04.040]  and then they'll turn the heat up again and bankrupt the nouveau riche and then the wealthy
[01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:10.840]  only the ultra rich offshore will be left with money and there'll be no ladder up for the poor
[01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:15.480]  the permanent poor and then they're going to cut the welfare off which is already beginning notice
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:22.120]  right that they cross the 50 mark now they're up like 50 plus percent just just a year ago it was
[01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:29.480]  47 percent now it's 49 about to be 51 52 you count all the illegals it's like 60 and then
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:34.680]  now they're going to start cutting the benefits back and then means testing do you sterilize
[01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:40.440]  yourself do you take the vaccines do you volunteer compulsory volunteer work for the
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:47.560]  different youth brigades so there you go americans are the recipients of means tested government
[01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:53.000]  benefits have now outnumbered the total population the philippines
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:12:03.720]  and i have more reports here where they are now telling workers go get on welfare this is the new
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:10.120]  american way and then oh the pentagon secretary of the army came out as we reported last hour
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:15.880]  fox news you name it's reporting it info wars.com has the document and they've come out and they've
[01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:21.720]  said you know what we are teaching that christians are illegal and that praying and being an evangelical
[01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:25.320]  is illegal and we're going to arrest you and we are teaching you can't be part of the tea party
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:38.120]  and we'll arrest you and we're suspending that for now this government is pure evil but oh you woke up

[01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:01.800]  info wars dot com article about this and i think it's important we understand if you go to democrat
[01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:09.800]  areas uh in your city and i'm not even a republican folks you know that i'm just saying the democrats
[01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:16.520]  are the model of dumb down submissive slave if we go to democratic areas of austin they sign the same
[01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:22.680]  thing to make austin nazi germany for obama to put gun owners in camps for obama to ban water for
[01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:28.520]  obama to put make people wear helmets on their heads for safety if you say for safety for the
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:34.280]  children for obama i want to send my crew out and literally say we want to well we already said kill
[01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:40.440]  babies up to age three for obama but how about throw babies and woodchippers live for obama
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:47.080]  or something like that or or or throw babies to pit bulls to be eaten for obama they will sign it
[01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:51.720]  and i'm not i'm not joking if you say for obama there might be a good pickup line if you're you
[01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:56.280]  know walk up to a woman is obama's porter and say come home with me immediately for obama
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:02.680]  and i mean maybe that's what this is all about i mean it's like programming and they do it and you
[01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:08.360]  have to understand when we show these and when mark does it he'll go out for 15 minutes and
[01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:15.960]  we're not cherry picking folks this is really what happened so mark we're going to break in a minute
[01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:19.480]  and also we'll talk about a tv show that aired last night nationally that you were on that i'm
[01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:26.200]  surprised actually covered bohemian grove and skull and bones so good job on that front but mark uh
[01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:32.200]  i mean is there nothing they won't sign these crazy petitions i've been doing them for about
[01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:37.240]  nine months now and it's sort of just repealing the second amendment during the the gun debate i
[01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:42.520]  thought let's see if we could get people to just repeal the second amendment and do gun confiscations
[01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:48.200]  and it was no problem door-to-door gun confiscations cascades and i just kept doing it more and more
[01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:53.880]  outrageous let's ban pressure cookers from let's ban muslims from buying pressure cookers to keep
[01:27:53.880 --> 01:28:00.040]  people safe let's ban black backpacks because the boston bombers used black backpacks
[01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:06.280]  statistics show that the terrorists used black pack that black let's do one let's ban uh butcher
[01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:10.520]  knives and show people an article of someone killed by one they're actually trying that in england
[01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:16.280]  there's one video that i haven't posted yet that is the only concept that didn't really work i mean
[01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:21.800]  it would have worked it just would have taken maybe three times the amount of uh opportunities to
[01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:27.160]  show the videos i only show half the people in the videos because three four five minutes you get
[01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:31.880]  the point an eight nine ten minute video of the same thing over and over again it's going to be a
[01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:37.000]  little redundant yeah let's be clear you could show a lot more of these people oh i could show
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:41.560]  probably two or three times as many sometimes there's some audio problems a little bit of static
[01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:45.720]  with people's cell phones with the wireless mic and everything but for the most part i'm showing
[01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:50.840]  probably half of the people and like you said if you just mentioned those keywords will you
[01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:56.040]  support obama i mean as as some of your audience knows as you know i've got them to sign petitions
[01:28:56.040 --> 01:29:02.040]  to repeal the first amendment the second the fourth the sixth and seventh and by the way my
[01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:06.600]  crew right my crew has been out with you multiple times and witnessed it themselves and we've done
[01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:12.200]  it in austin i mean this is on record of course now mark we're going to break when we get your
[01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:17.240]  take on this when we come back they're saying they're going to arrest people that are evangelical
[01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:22.280]  or give money to the tea party uh who who are in the military i mean that shows these are
[01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:28.200]  authoritarians and the population is willing to do literally anything assign their name
[01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:33.320]  birthday and signature to the policy no matter how crazy it sounds it this is the zombie plague
[01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:38.200]  it's it's spreading we can stop it but it's it's going to be a tough tough uphill battle well the
[01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:41.880]  thing is i've also noticed if you try to wake the zombies up they then just call you racist
[01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:46.440]  you could be talking about the weather and their response is racist so that's what the zombie
[01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:52.440]  chirps its call is like racist racist racist here on the march instead of like a sheep buying it's a

[01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:37.320]  all the hip young things
[01:33:41.240 --> 01:33:43.400]  know that obama is their king
[01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:53.800]  and the number one rule of the modern age is don't think just feel trendy and sign on to anything as
[01:33:53.800 --> 01:34:01.000]  long as it's for big government and the loving state and of course they got a rude awakening
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:05.640]  coming once the globalists fully take over just like they do in every other collectivist country
[01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:10.840]  there's not going to be any welfare it's going to be fox con slave factories with suicide nets
[01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:16.760]  forced abortions and mobile execution vans until they've got the robots in place which is only about
[01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:24.360]  10 to 15 years out for pretty much total conversion to robots the french one i haven't done in six years
[01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:29.560]  then the bio weapons are going to get released the minute the robots are in and working they're
[01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:33.960]  only there to take our jobs get us dependent on government they're going to be scrapped as well
[01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:41.400]  this is a high-tech form of warfare i cover it in my film in-game blueprint for global enslavement
[01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:45.880]  and the reason i laugh is it's so painful and i just think of how naive the general public
[01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:51.720]  is and has no idea of the technocracy they're facing and that it's all public it's all in white
[01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:57.160]  paper is the total plan i've made films about it we've broken down the plandopolis every word i tell
[01:34:57.160 --> 01:35:01.720]  you by the way you can go look up and then find just volumes in their own words on their battle
[01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:08.200]  plan for you and your family so you can either roll over and die and laugh at me or you can
[01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:13.000]  stand up and research this and find out i'm telling you the truth and then call me up hyperventilating
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:18.360]  and saying it's it's worse worse worse worse worse you said yes i know it's worse than i said i can't
[01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:22.600]  believe i'm still alive i can't believe we're at this level having this big of an effect
[01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:29.480]  but it shows there's still forces of good in the universe and evil hasn't fully converted over yet
[01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:35.000]  but it's getting close we're in grave danger we're gonna go back to mark dice in a moment and get
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:39.080]  into some other issues with him as well then your phone calls i remember we're listeners supported
[01:35:39.080 --> 01:35:47.400]  and what i do is i go out and i find the very best products out there that i use and that i have a
[01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:54.040]  great effect from like the best clean seaweed pure brown seaweed extract modifying from the southern
[01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:59.480]  hemisphere we've had this tested the grip that we've got it from hasn't tested this is about the
[01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:03.080]  cleanest seaweed you can find out there i say about the cleanest we don't know if there's cleaner
[01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:07.400]  out there that somebody hadn't found this is what i take it's what my family takes it's incredible
[01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:12.840]  and then i began to research the nascent iodine that's naturally in it and found the ultimate
[01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:20.040]  from our research info wars survival shield proprietary patented form of nascent iodine
[01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:26.040]  and i've finally been allowed to know how it's actually made if that's a secret it's incredible
[01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:31.320]  russian scientists the whole nine yards it's made in utah and it is it is tesla type stuff
[01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:36.520]  that's all i'm going to tell you i'm not allowed to say anymore the point is this is it and it's
[01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:41.000]  sold out they are making more for me right now they can't believe how much of it we sold
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:44.920]  not even that much really in the aggregate for for a company like this it's more like a laboratory
[01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:50.040]  so you can pre-order it it'll be in in a couple weeks really probably a week or so but i don't
[01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:55.320]  want to say that anytime to ship it out so if you want to get in line and the pre-order we're

[01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:50.680]  there on the site all right folks um we're going to go back to mark dice now that was a short
[01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:55.960]  segment mark getting back into the zombie osis this is quite frightening and everybody should
[01:37:55.960 --> 01:38:01.640]  be concerned it should be not just national news at info wars dot com or drudge report dot com
[01:38:01.640 --> 01:38:07.080]  this should be discussed on abc news nbc news but they don't want to do that this is their target
[01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:13.000]  audience this is why they teach common core two plus two equals five i feel like a liar when i say
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:18.840]  that it's on record they teach two plus two equals five now you can't pack lunches under obama care
[01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:23.800]  and under michelle's control nationwide the announcements being made from virginia uh to
[01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:28.680]  california that you can't pack lunch period for your children they will eat deadly gmo they will
[01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:34.680]  eat aspartame i mean they're now taking the velvet glove off and and taking the cloaking device
[01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:40.280]  often and really telling us you're a prisoner what do you make of the military saying you will not be
[01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:45.560]  an evangelical or we will arrest you and the army now admits that the secretary of the army
[01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:51.880]  has come out and said well that is being taught and it shouldn't be i mean i mean the the magnitude
[01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:57.960]  of this how evil these people are well the new world order obviously is aiming to destroy our culture
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:01.960]  to keep everybody out of the way so that they can do whatever they want to do in the government and
[01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:07.000]  evolve into their luciferian god and prepare the planet really for their illuminati messiah so
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:13.000]  dumbing down the culture is is obviously working it is a zombie apocalypse i'm even using that
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:17.720]  terminology for years but it's it's virtually true and these petitions that i've been doing over the
[01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:24.600]  last year show that people will approve and stamp their name on the most ridiculous things or simply
[01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:29.720]  just not pay any attention just believe the line that they're told about what it is not critically
[01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:34.760]  thinking for itself so if i can get these people to sign petitions to repeal the bill of rights
[01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:40.840]  to support a nazi style or willian police state to ban black backpacks to just do these ridiculous
[01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:45.720]  things that nobody in their right mind should even consider occasionally you can see people
[01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:49.080]  cracking a smile and busting out laughing and realizing what i'm doing and i show them in
[01:39:49.080 --> 01:39:55.800]  the videos but the vast majority of the people are virtually walking mindless mentally enslaved
[01:39:55.800 --> 01:40:01.880]  mainstream media watching and music listening morons and that's why these people will do whatever
[01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:06.200]  it takes that's why they'll round up the christians at some point and point the finger at us because
[01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:11.800]  we're trying to preserve the culture and prevent it from getting sucked down this hollywood vortex
[01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:20.360]  this do what thou wilt social Darwinistic sin is in culture and so that's why christians are seen
[01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:27.880]  as the problem because we are the last stitches holding this society the fabric of society together
[01:40:27.880 --> 01:40:33.960]  before the Orwellian Illuminati plan is able to just unroll without any opposition that's right
[01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:37.240]  and they're going to come to our farms they're going to come to our apartments on our homes and
[01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:41.640]  they've said they're going to take our children and josslyn elders said this they're going to take
[01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:46.680]  our three-year-olds and take them into a public area and grab their genitals josslyn elders said
[01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:51.240]  reach down and show them how to do it i mean play that club and and and people say well why are they
[01:40:51.240 --> 01:40:56.120]  into that because they're if you read the bible or any other history the bible it's been confirmed
[01:40:56.120 --> 01:41:01.320]  especially the new testament is history by the roman historians and others very accurate about what
[01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:06.360]  went on in those times every corrupt culture didn't just say we want to rape your kids we want to
[01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:15.400]  burn them to an idol the druids the Aztecs societies follow a decadence arc that's why we see Hollywood
[01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:19.880]  putting out movies like hostile and all these horror movies where the worse the more graphic the more
[01:41:19.880 --> 01:41:25.480]  violent the more disgusting these saw films the more the audience likes it purge oh yeah it's just
[01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:30.600]  everybody likes to go and watch the majority of the brain dead american public loves to go and watch
[01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:34.520]  these movies and lives vicariously through the audience or through their characters murdering
[01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:39.080]  these people that's how disgusting and decadent our culture that's right the murderers are now
[01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:44.440]  the good guys but then if you say something to these people they're offended and call the police
[01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:49.640]  on you so they grovel in fear of any type of goodness or freedom but then they fantasize
[01:41:49.640 --> 01:41:56.600]  that they're raping children we have illuminati icons like miley cyrus who i call miley virus
[01:41:56.600 --> 01:42:02.680]  a an illuminati icon of evil literally teaching the children how to pop ecstasy i mean she's
[01:42:02.680 --> 01:42:07.480]  literally singing about popping ecstasy and partying and this was all planned to make her a child star
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:13.000]  bait the hook get everyone in yes and she's on all the family friendly shows you know in a perfect
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:18.920]  world in a sane world good morning america ellen all of these seemingly family friendly talk shows
[01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:24.600]  would shun such as satanic skank and would have nothing to do with her but instead the mainstream
[01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:30.680]  media monopoly is illuminati controlled mind controlling machine promotes these people
[01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:36.040]  puts them on all the magazines puts them on all the shows i can't even go to the gym without listening
[01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:44.600]  to this pop culture porta potty uh just these gargoyles pumping their urine stream the mainstream
[01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:50.520]  media is a urine urine but i mean seriously though they are on record and some of redstone said
[01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:56.520]  it's like a decade ago trying to sexualize 20s that was an official memo put out by nicolodian i
[01:42:56.520 --> 01:43:02.840]  mean these are weapon systems you turn on any cop show now anybody that wants freedom is you know
[01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:08.040]  being arrested i mean we can really see where they want to take us this is this is a where do you
[01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:14.520]  think their ultimate in game is uh the hollywood cretins and others well the ultimate end game is
[01:43:14.520 --> 01:43:20.120]  to have a massive lower class of people that suck off of the what's left of the middle class the
[01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:25.720]  producing class uh in order to create a bigger bureaucracy i'm sorry a bureaucracy it is a
[01:43:25.720 --> 01:43:30.680]  bureaucracy at this point too to create an entitlement class an ineptocracy where you have
[01:43:30.680 --> 01:43:35.080]  a small percentage of people that are working and trying to work hard and get ahead and and raise
[01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:42.280]  their family and and maintain some sort of a positive image in the culture to suck their wealth
[01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:47.960]  to give it to those who don't work who don't uh care to then enslave those people so that you
[01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:52.280]  can't get ahead you can't retire you can't take that vacation you can't go to take a couple days
[01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:58.600]  off to go and protest um so that you are enslaved to your own job while the lower class the the
[01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:06.280]  mentally enslaved welfare class is then leaching off of those producers and it's ultimately to
[01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:12.280]  produce a literal satanic society that's why we have these illuminati wannabes in the mainstream
[01:44:12.280 --> 01:44:17.720]  media promoting satanism pop stars promoting satanism in the illuminati this isn't just
[01:44:17.720 --> 01:44:23.320]  just heavy metal or rock stars i mean we're talking about female pop stars kesha rihanna
[01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:28.760]  christina aguilera to destroy the most real old-fashioned classic rocker heavy metal
[01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:33.640]  you really listen to it is a lot of it's actually anti-satan it's just really heavy and male this
[01:44:33.640 --> 01:44:39.000]  stuff is satanic is illuminati has all the proper symbols it's not even you know old-fashioned bat
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:44.440]  them at stuff it is targeting directly at little girls we got rihanna one of the biggest pop
[01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:49.400]  stars in the world i mean she has a music video out called s&m sadomasa kids i mean she's dressed
[01:44:49.400 --> 01:44:53.960]  up in bondage looks like she's about to get gang banged by a bunch of dudes on a dirty mattress
[01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:59.000]  with a bunch of big brother or welly and cameras in another video she's dancing around on the floor
[01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:03.560]  and what looks to be a satanic pentagram painted on the floor and satanic off of med devil horns
[01:45:03.560 --> 01:45:09.320]  this is what your kids are being taught to idolize and mimic and we have any issue is it's not even
[01:45:09.320 --> 01:45:14.280]  an issue now but expanding on this it's not because they're going to give us some heavenly
[01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:20.120]  world where you know the guys all have fun with the devil cheerleaders that's just bait on the hook
[01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:23.640]  it's it's it's in the communist goals in fact i haven't around here i'm going to go over some of
[01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:29.560]  those with you it is in the goals openly that that were put in the congressional record to destroy
[01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:35.240]  us morally so we will stand down and be enslaved and this isn't just communist enslavement to be
[01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:41.640]  physical slaves this is for the world population reduction program well ultimately it's a hedonistic
[01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:46.200]  do-it-all wilt society i mean at some point when this luciferian illuminati anti christ
[01:45:46.200 --> 01:45:50.360]  their supposed messiah appears the reason christians are going to be demonized is because
[01:45:50.360 --> 01:45:54.120]  we're going to be the ones that are saying wait a minute that is wrong we shouldn't be doing that
[01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:59.400]  we we want to preserve a family we we have family values so we are seen as the enemy and so that's
[01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:04.920]  why they're poisoning the culture through these pop stars through the mentally enslaving mainstream
[01:46:04.920 --> 01:46:11.400]  media and that's right and and and now they've got giant drooling satanic welfare hordes who who openly
[01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:15.640]  uh people calling all the time i see it in the news principles will tell fathers your kids belong
[01:46:15.640 --> 01:46:21.640]  to us now get out of here and the cops are just sitting with their weapons i mean they it is pure
[01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:26.600]  evil and they know it's their time and if you have a family if you don't have a family structure
[01:46:26.600 --> 01:46:31.400]  you don't have a father a mother aunt and uncle's grandparents to show you support to teach you
[01:46:31.400 --> 01:46:36.360]  then you see the government as god you see the government as your big brother and that's of course
[01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:42.120]  their plan to destroy the family to create people a welfare state an entitlement class a cradle to
[01:46:42.120 --> 01:46:48.120]  grave nanny state where the government is your god the government provides everything that you
[01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:53.000]  need not your family you don't need to work for it yourself the government will give it to you if
[01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:59.080]  you follow in line which is extremely surprising about the the pop star the mainstream media machine
[01:46:59.080 --> 01:47:03.240]  it's completely surprising that i was able to appear on the each channel the entertainment
[01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:09.000]  channel last night in secret societies of hollywood a kind of a salacious a scandalous
[01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:14.280]  look at hollywood sex clubs and the the drug dealing and the the private parties the bondage
[01:47:14.280 --> 01:47:19.720]  things but they did at the very end of this two hour special actually include me talking about the
[01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:25.480]  bill the burr group of the bohemian grove in a pretty fair way and people when i how can this
[01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:30.680]  happen how could you get on the tv because entertainment shows like this don't have the
[01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:35.400]  gatekeepers that hard news do you see the illuminati's not all powerful people think that they have
[01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:39.320]  all power no they're very powerful but they don't have their tentacles wrapped around well i want
[01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:44.440]  to be clear because i've been you know watching this as well from the inside being able to be in
[01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:48.520]  a lot of mainstream media stuff to the point of not even really wanting to do it and and refusing
[01:47:48.520 --> 01:47:54.280]  90 percent of it now more than that hard news they're worried about a hard news audience
[01:47:54.280 --> 01:47:59.800]  who's at a higher level of awakening so it's different propaganda this is aimed at slugs
[01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:04.760]  they think the slugs are going to want to be in the illuminati now and are going to think this is
[01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:09.720]  really sexy and cool yeah and you're right sometimes stuff slips through but here it is
[01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:16.680]  premiering tonight secret hollywood societies and unsolved mysteries go ahead yeah and that's
[01:48:16.680 --> 01:48:21.080]  part of the reason why these pop stars are doing this because they're teaching the people to appeal
[01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:26.440]  to it most of the mentally enslaved population instead of seeing the illuminati as bad they
[01:48:26.440 --> 01:48:31.160]  they're appealing the power is very appealing they want that wealth they want the most successful
[01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:36.120]  come on lines now it's been in the news that you tell young girls i'm with the illuminati you do
[01:48:36.120 --> 01:48:41.160]  bad things have sex with me i'll let you in and it's just con artists including pedophiles over
[01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:46.440]  aged you know you know guys with girls are like 15 16 and they just fall right in line because
[01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:51.080]  you know for everybody from adana down to casket everybody else uh you know this is how you get
[01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:56.280]  the power but really you just get enslaved and end up being a crack whore yeah that's you know
[01:48:56.280 --> 01:49:00.680]  people think that celebrity is a good thing people appeal they want to be that celebrity that's why
[01:49:00.680 --> 01:49:05.560]  they idolize these really false idols but the celebrities can't tell you that fame is a curse
[01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:11.800]  they're some of the most empty shallow fearful people paranoid most people can't even understand
[01:49:11.800 --> 01:49:17.560]  what goes along with being somebody like a celebrity like these people we see on the tv and me it's a
[01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:22.840]  curse and it's such a curse that the celebrities themselves can't even tell the audience to stay
[01:49:22.840 --> 01:49:27.240]  away and that's part of the system is to keep sucking more and more people in to make it seem
[01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:32.360]  like that's the ultimate goal in life is to go to these red carpet events and just look pretty
[01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:38.840]  and have paparazzi chasing you around and that's what these zombie the generation z is generation
[01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:44.520]  zombie the problem is 99.99 percent of people will never even be in the edge of celebrity
[01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:49.960]  so they don't know how hollow it is i have gained quite a bit of quote celebrity and and have absolutely
[01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:55.160]  hated every minute of it except for being able to do good with it as kind of an anti-celebrity
[01:49:55.160 --> 01:50:00.680]  you i know have have now been able to traffic in that has it not demysticized it for you mark
[01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:07.160]  dice now that you've had a chance to uh you know be known yeah it's it's pretty interesting i mean
[01:50:07.160 --> 01:50:11.400]  there's a lot of downside that goes with it much of the audience has no idea the kind of baggage
[01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:15.880]  that comes along with being a public figure especially being a public figure in this arena
[01:50:15.880 --> 01:50:19.880]  and it's you know the more popular i get almost the more regretful it is but there's
[01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:25.400]  you have to do this to reach the people this is what i was made to do is to infiltrate this system
[01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:30.360]  to culture jam their mainstream sure that's what we're all meant to do exactly is fight this my
[01:50:30.360 --> 01:50:34.920]  point is for those that feel inadequate because they sit there and watch tv all day it's literally

[02:01:33.560 --> 02:01:41.720]  theft auto uh so when i was playing it uh the one character is a crazy like canadian uh like he's
[02:01:41.720 --> 02:01:45.000]  basically a terrorist because he's going around doing all these crimes but he's working with a
[02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:50.360]  militia called civil border patrol and they they do all sorts of like together as a unit they do all
[02:01:50.360 --> 02:01:54.680]  sorts of uh like crimes and and blow up things and stuff like that and they're demonized throughout
[02:01:54.680 --> 02:02:01.560]  the game too it's pretty uh it's pretty weird that that like that happens in that game sir it's all
[02:02:01.560 --> 02:02:11.000]  my i'd say it's about 90 plus percent of every video game every cop show every popular book
[02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:21.400]  everything out there is cartoons you know green lantern fights the militia that's the bad guy
[02:02:22.360 --> 02:02:26.120]  like captain america fought the nazis well captain america fights patriots now
[02:02:27.560 --> 02:02:35.800]  this is social engineering this is an all out culture war i mean do you understand that the army
[02:02:35.800 --> 02:02:40.760]  officially admits that they were teaching that being an evangelical christian is a arrestable
[02:02:40.760 --> 02:02:50.120]  offense i mean that that is that is soviet union sir i mean the the government is run by absolute
[02:02:50.840 --> 02:02:55.160]  red chair criminals god bless you and and and what everybody should do is because i can't cover all
[02:02:55.160 --> 02:03:01.560]  this you should tape a clip of that or or show a clip of it on your computer put it on youtube
[02:03:01.560 --> 02:03:06.520]  say grand theft auto for whatever it is demonizes patriots it'll get seen by a bunch of people
[02:03:06.520 --> 02:03:13.080]  then we can do a report you get the humid off the state run media and then respond to it you
[02:03:13.080 --> 02:03:18.760]  have to battle it and then battle it then we'll talk about it when you see the programming you
[02:03:18.760 --> 02:03:28.120]  have to a respond to it b boycott it c speak out against it publicly not just on cyberspace
[02:03:28.680 --> 02:03:34.120]  and then do something against the enemy all right let's go to uh sam in california welcome
[02:03:34.120 --> 02:03:40.600]  you're on the air hey alex uh how you doing man i'm good thanks for holding go ahead hey god bless
[02:03:40.600 --> 02:03:47.080]  you so uh i wanted to first start off by saying wow i can't believe japan's got hit again that's
[02:03:47.080 --> 02:03:53.240]  that's ridiculous this is stranger than fiction literally you couldn't make this stuff up
[02:03:55.000 --> 02:04:02.520]  so uh anyways um i was trying to make a point about what the next step would be knowing what's
[02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:10.120]  coming uh for all of us americans and patriots um the only thing i can really see other than you
[02:04:10.120 --> 02:04:16.920]  know as far as peaceful means go you know people gotta really really double down on the family
[02:04:17.480 --> 02:04:22.200]  and people have to stand around if you're gonna have a kid you gotta stand around to raise that
[02:04:22.200 --> 02:04:28.920]  kid men gotta be men again women have to be ladies again you gotta reverse this whole
[02:04:28.920 --> 02:04:37.640]  this this rapid rapid descent into the darkness man it's terrible there's no there's no coming
[02:04:37.640 --> 02:04:44.520]  out of that end so we gotta reverse it we can't proceed going forward can't be done you're like

[02:08:27.480 --> 02:08:31.240]  said that if they gave money the evangelical groups of the tea party they would be court
[02:08:31.240 --> 02:08:37.000]  marshal violating their first amendment no that's not the old soviet union or nazi germany that's
[02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:43.160]  america and we're going to a special guest who's heading up a group with oliver stone and others
[02:08:43.160 --> 02:08:49.320]  to try to draw bipartisan attention to the illegal nsa spying then your phone calls are coming up
[02:08:50.120 --> 02:08:56.760]  but right now we need to go to brian in arizona he's saying he's a military police and he says
[02:08:56.760 --> 02:09:01.320]  we've been sent footage before by military police and others so i want this footage of them in
[02:09:01.320 --> 02:09:07.560]  briefings openly talking about gun confiscations now that's now in the manuals that they're training
[02:09:07.560 --> 02:09:11.880]  to quarantine cities and towns and confiscate guns we've had navy seals on confirming it
[02:09:11.880 --> 02:09:19.240]  we have the documents we know that but footage not just in some army manual but footage could really
[02:09:19.880 --> 02:09:24.280]  really hurt uh the folks that are trying to covertly prepare the military for basically
[02:09:24.280 --> 02:09:30.600]  civil war brian obviously uh you've got to go back in right now tell us as much as you can
[02:09:30.600 --> 02:09:36.760]  and how we get this footage but describe it for us okay so i was in a briefing with uh fema fema
[02:09:36.760 --> 02:09:42.040]  runs my old unit i'm actually out now i got out in september of this year uh they were talking
[02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:46.040]  about suspension of the constitution second and fourth amendment rights being taken away and i
[02:09:46.040 --> 02:09:51.960]  openly ask them are we going to take guns he says no but he says they will it's clearly on the video
[02:09:51.960 --> 02:09:59.080]  they will talking about the fema guys with us um so that's the gist of the video you could uh i'm
[02:09:59.080 --> 02:10:02.680]  filming the floor because it kind of startled me when they said that they're going to suspend the
[02:10:02.680 --> 02:10:08.920]  constitution under martial law which is pretty scary to me well sir you you have a right when
[02:10:08.920 --> 02:10:14.040]  something is uh illegal like this you should go public give us your full name we'll try to stand
[02:10:14.040 --> 02:10:20.280]  behind you and everything uh and uh come on the show and talk about it i'm do you have any
[02:10:20.280 --> 02:10:28.120]  establishing video before you aim to the floor now you can see the soldiers acus uh and i mean i
[02:10:28.120 --> 02:10:32.200]  have training regarding steam accounts i probably have three or four soldiers who would come forward
[02:10:32.200 --> 02:10:36.280]  and talk about that too all right well i'm ready to fly you all here right now because here's the
[02:10:36.280 --> 02:10:41.640]  deal i have all this in the civilian inmate labor camp programs uh the emergency centers
[02:10:41.640 --> 02:10:46.760]  establishment act i have footage i've shot of them training to do it and saying it's for americans but
[02:10:46.760 --> 02:10:52.440]  then saying you know later in the news it was for overseas of course it's joint use so it's on record
[02:10:52.440 --> 02:10:58.840]  it's just that we need the soldiers themselves and the internal videos because for whatever reason
[02:10:58.840 --> 02:11:04.840]  the whole world is a stage each of us players upon it as shakespeare said it's the seeing it
[02:11:04.840 --> 02:11:09.080]  that makes people believe it can you just upload it to youtube or how can you get us that video
[02:11:09.800 --> 02:11:13.640]  um if you guys could give me like an address i can mail you like a little thumb drive i'll
[02:11:13.640 --> 02:11:16.920]  upload it to youtube too but i'm a little nervous i don't know if i could get in trouble for it is
[02:11:16.920 --> 02:11:22.120]  why i didn't already do it did they tell you it was a classified briefing no the fema agents in
[02:11:22.120 --> 02:11:25.640]  there or i don't know what you want to call them the fema people are they don't have security
[02:11:25.640 --> 02:11:29.320]  clearances i don't i mean i already knew that exactly because i've aired fema training videos
[02:11:29.320 --> 02:11:34.120]  here it's got to be 20 times over the years saying the founding fathers are bad all of that stuff
[02:11:34.120 --> 02:11:40.360]  we're going to you know go after them so the issue is if if if if they're talking about
[02:11:40.360 --> 02:11:45.880]  just emergencies and it's in plain view uh you morally uh can do whatever you want i mean they
[02:11:45.880 --> 02:11:50.760]  may down the road try to say you can't i mean they're saying you can't be a christian but we
[02:11:50.760 --> 02:11:58.760]  have to call them on it to back them off uh so uh i mean i can't give you myself legal advice because
[02:11:58.760 --> 02:12:03.160]  i wasn't there i don't know what they said but no they would say as you know this is a classified
[02:12:03.160 --> 02:12:07.640]  briefing under subsection such and such remember you've signed agreements you know do not release
[02:12:07.640 --> 02:12:12.280]  this information this is need to know the folder you were given would say secret top secret or
[02:12:12.280 --> 02:12:17.480]  it would say restricted uh so no i mean i put out restricted stuff constantly uh and i look at it
[02:12:17.480 --> 02:12:21.880]  make a determination uh but i don't think this was even restricted from what you're saying
[02:12:21.880 --> 02:12:31.320]  so i would simply i would simply uh go to another site i mean if i was you personally i would just
[02:12:31.320 --> 02:12:36.840]  upload it uh to a youtube account and i would use something like a proxy server when you go and sign
[02:12:36.840 --> 02:12:42.040]  up and do it the problem is google google wants uh that owns youtube wants that but i mean i mean
[02:12:42.040 --> 02:12:46.760]  i'm not going to tell you what what you should do i because i already know what's in the manuals
[02:12:46.760 --> 02:12:51.640]  people seem to see the video i would just upload it and say who i was and be upfront saying i'm a
[02:12:51.640 --> 02:12:56.120]  good guy i have nothing to hide see because they've got us in this the troops that told me they were
[02:12:56.120 --> 02:13:01.880]  threatening to arrest christians last year were scared to go public well they finally went public
[02:13:01.880 --> 02:13:06.760]  and now the secretary of the army has had to back off and say we're not going to do this anymore
[02:13:06.760 --> 02:13:13.080]  so people need to know that fema is training to suspend the constitution and confiscate firearms
[02:13:13.080 --> 02:13:20.520]  um what i can do serve is that we have sub youtube accounts if you know how to do it
[02:13:21.320 --> 02:13:24.680]  because i could just listening to you i trust you and plus we have sub accounts
[02:13:24.680 --> 02:13:29.560]  i can have one of my guys rob do walk you through uploading it to our account how's that sound
[02:13:30.360 --> 02:13:33.800]  that sounds good i want to get the word out there because i talk to people about it like
[02:13:33.800 --> 02:13:38.600]  i've seen it i understand it and they're like oh that's crazy talk but i want them to hear them say
[02:13:38.600 --> 02:13:44.360]  the constitution will be suspended and they will take guns they would be fema in our meeting well
[02:13:44.360 --> 02:13:52.280]  as you know it was fbi atf and auxiliary police the the army would run security in katrina and it
[02:13:52.280 --> 02:13:59.560]  was uh units under fema that did the gun grabbing i know i i asked him about that they say we won't
[02:13:59.560 --> 02:14:04.760]  take him i said but what about katrina he said well that was a different story well i would upload
[02:14:04.760 --> 02:14:08.760]  plus they'll say it's out of context i would upload a large chunk of it a couple minutes before a
[02:14:08.760 --> 02:14:16.200]  few months after uh and i mean if i was you i'd just come out this is your choice but i mean
[02:14:16.200 --> 02:14:21.240]  you know this will arrest you if you're a christian a mainline christian i mean if you were a weirdo
[02:14:21.240 --> 02:14:26.760]  group you shouldn't arrest people i mean this is just we've got to stand and say we're not bad
[02:14:26.760 --> 02:14:31.240]  you're bad i'm going to put you on hold give us your name and number we'll keep that secret unless
[02:14:31.240 --> 02:14:37.400]  you uh you know don't want it to be secret and then i will have rob do call you uh as soon as
[02:14:37.400 --> 02:14:42.680]  you're ready we're ready to do the upload uh so let's set that appointment okay all right sounds
[02:14:42.680 --> 02:14:47.160]  good thank you very much great put him on hold double check his number give it to rob do this is
[02:14:47.160 --> 02:14:51.880]  maximum level importance i want this uploaded immediately dug palet with other fema videos
[02:14:51.880 --> 02:14:56.840]  we have in context and the training manual that will deal with the cognitive dissidents
[02:14:56.840 --> 02:15:02.200]  when the infiltrators try to say it's fake all right let's move on to the next issue uh the nsa
[02:15:02.200 --> 02:15:06.120]  i've got a bunch of breaking news on that but since he's been holding without breaking news
[02:15:06.120 --> 02:15:11.800]  ben dorenberg you've probably heard uh there is a national movement varieties reporting on it
[02:15:11.800 --> 02:15:16.840]  oliver stone john cusack warned against nsa surveillance and i really like oliver stone
[02:15:17.720 --> 02:15:22.920]  for his courage on jfk but also saying obama is a snake worse than bush because he's able to get
[02:15:22.920 --> 02:15:30.280]  stuff over on people uh sythia mckinney says a more effective of evils uh and he joins us to talk
[02:15:30.280 --> 02:15:38.360]  about this big demonstration that's coming up ben dorenberg of rally dot stop watching us dot us
[02:15:38.360 --> 02:15:43.560]  thank you for coming on thank you so much for having me alex uh wow you've got the floor sir
[02:15:43.560 --> 02:15:48.760]  tell us about what's coming up and uh why your group has coalesced around the fourth amendment
[02:15:48.760 --> 02:15:55.000]  absolutely so the rally against mass surveillance which is rally dot stop watching dot us is going
[02:15:55.000 --> 02:16:00.200]  to be the largest rally in us history against surveillance and for our right to privacy and
[02:16:00.200 --> 02:16:07.080]  so it's uh literally hundreds of groups so we've got everyone from the aclu to uh reddit to young
[02:16:07.080 --> 02:16:12.840]  americans for liberty and the libertarian party um so the rally is going to be in dc at noon tomorrow
[02:16:12.840 --> 02:16:17.880]  at union station and we've got nsa whistleblower speaking someone's going to be reading a new
[02:16:17.880 --> 02:16:24.120]  statement from edward snowden uh who endorsed the rally we're going to have um thomas drake uh
[02:16:24.120 --> 02:16:29.240]  representative justin amash who was the libertarian congressman who introduced the bill that almost
[02:16:29.240 --> 02:16:34.520]  cut funding for uh for the nsa's phone record program and uh as well as a whole lot of other
[02:16:34.520 --> 02:16:38.840]  speakers so it's you know if you're you're going to take a few hours out of your life to do anything
[02:16:38.840 --> 02:16:43.880]  on the nsa issue and try and get them uh to stop surveilling every american this is this is the time
[02:16:43.880 --> 02:16:50.200]  to do it certainly and now we learn that it's public figures all over the world for blackmailing
[02:16:50.200 --> 02:16:57.720]  purposes we learned this is something that makes the stasi uh blush uh what do you personally think
[02:16:57.720 --> 02:17:03.480]  of from just a year ago you were a kook if you said we're being spot on to now we know
[02:17:03.480 --> 02:17:09.000]  edward snowden has exposed everything has basically recorded yeah well that's why that's
[02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:13.000]  why this rally is so important because you know before it was a thing where yeah some
[02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:17.160]  some of us knew that that things like this were going on and it was uh yeah people were called
[02:17:17.160 --> 02:17:21.560]  kooks and now it's at the point where now everyone knows what's going on and if we don't take a stand
[02:17:21.560 --> 02:17:26.440]  now then i think the takeaway is going to be that oh the american people must be okay with this
[02:17:26.440 --> 02:17:32.680]  and uh you know we we can't live in a free country if if every every action every website we visit
[02:17:32.680 --> 02:17:37.480]  every email we send our phone call we make is is being surveilled it's it's not compatible with
[02:17:37.480 --> 02:17:41.880]  the constitution and it's not compatible with with the kind of life that that we want to live
[02:17:41.880 --> 02:17:48.200]  well as you said silence is consent they will set the precedent for this we've got to have
[02:17:48.200 --> 02:17:53.960]  people prosecuted you've got bipartisan uh folks coming out like marco rubio today it's
[02:17:53.960 --> 02:17:59.880]  up on info wars dot com diane feinstein last week saying it's no big deal everything gets
[02:17:59.880 --> 02:18:07.080]  spied on big deal it's like oh you know it's big deal you know everybody knows the nazi spy on you
[02:18:07.080 --> 02:18:12.600]  i mean it's so unprecedented how they're trying to hide all this in plain view yeah well diane
[02:18:12.600 --> 02:18:16.680]  feinstein said that this wasn't surveillance what they're doing and edwards noden actually came
[02:18:16.680 --> 02:18:22.040]  straight out and just said uh you know what are you talking about but that's so that this coalition
[02:18:22.040 --> 02:18:28.120]  to stop watching this coalition that's we have three things that we're asking for uh one is um to
[02:18:28.120 --> 02:18:33.400]  make it explicitly illegal for these sort of blanket surveillance programs um and then step two
[02:18:33.400 --> 02:18:38.360]  what you're talking about is accountability for public officials who've lied to congress or to
[02:18:38.360 --> 02:18:43.160]  the american people so when you look at uh you know for me personally i think one of the most upsetting
[02:18:43.160 --> 02:18:49.400]  things is just watching that video of general clapper straight lying to the senate and uh with no
[02:18:49.400 --> 02:18:54.040]  consequences you know he didn't even lose his job let alone um you know it's a crime to lie to
[02:18:54.040 --> 02:18:59.000]  congress so i think uh uh you know people are outraged and so it's just a question of uh as you
[02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:03.880]  mentioned a few minutes ago it's you know you can't just stay on cyberspace you got to you know get up
[02:19:03.880 --> 02:19:08.760]  and and you know take to the streets and and do something about it so uh you know i hope everyone
[02:19:08.760 --> 02:19:14.360]  on the east coast uh is able to make it to dc um you know like i said it's it's rally dot stop

[02:24:09.560 --> 02:24:13.240]  are coming up directly at the start of the next segment and then the other news i haven't gotten
[02:24:13.240 --> 02:24:21.960]  to yet uh new news fox news is finally reporting an hour later uh on the tsunami uh news um or 45
[02:24:21.960 --> 02:24:30.120]  minutes later uh 7.3 some are saying 7.6 that hit off the coast of vukashima um prefect or state
[02:24:30.680 --> 02:24:35.960]  and we'll know i guess the next hour or so if a big tsunami hits they're telling people in coastal
[02:24:35.960 --> 02:24:42.200]  areas to evacuate and there's really no news in the us on this right now on fox tv that is
[02:24:42.200 --> 02:24:46.920]  mentioned it for five seconds out there and of course you know this all blows over directly on us
[02:24:46.920 --> 02:24:51.480]  and it's still melting down and worse than ever and many experts just a few weeks ago were saying
[02:24:51.480 --> 02:24:55.960]  if it hits with another earthquake of the same magnitude or near it i mean it we're talking
[02:24:55.960 --> 02:25:02.440]  total meltdown of all those fuel rods it'll make chernobyl look like a gift and chernobyl
[02:25:02.440 --> 02:25:08.280]  the un estimates killed a million people since 1986 from radiation i mean this is this is incredible
[02:25:08.280 --> 02:25:13.400]  and and at a certain point i mean just protecting your thyroid isn't enough folks
[02:25:14.120 --> 02:25:17.560]  if this continues i'm going to have to move my kids to the southern hemisphere i'm not kidding
[02:25:18.360 --> 02:25:21.880]  everybody just bathing irradiation and culture says it's good for you
[02:25:21.880 --> 02:25:26.520]  towards mommy i says it's okay why don't they go live in fukashima with all the dying kids and
[02:25:26.520 --> 02:25:31.800]  people uh this is incredible ben doranberg um a national chair restored the fourth
[02:25:32.680 --> 02:25:37.160]  grassroots national movement in nsa master valence there's a video we're going to play
[02:25:37.160 --> 02:25:41.240]  later every leaves us called stop spying on us what's the exact name of a guy's
[02:25:42.920 --> 02:25:47.880]  stop watching us and and you know he even corrected me it was worse than what i said when
[02:25:47.880 --> 02:25:52.600]  i paraphrase her saying the spying is no big deal she said something even more welly and i
[02:25:52.600 --> 02:25:58.280]  and feinstein a couple days ago she said this is not surveillance this is the very essence of the
[02:25:58.280 --> 02:26:04.200]  purest surveillance without a warrant that's surveillance it's warrant it's warranted surveillance
[02:26:04.200 --> 02:26:12.040]  this is unwarranted mass dragnet and it is incredible living in 1984 my friend
[02:26:14.040 --> 02:26:20.840]  it's uh it's it's just you know we didn't think this was you know i i didn't think people would
[02:26:20.840 --> 02:26:24.760]  would with a straight face you know claim that this that this isn't surveillance i mean it is
[02:26:24.760 --> 02:26:30.440]  crazy but you know i think what we're really seeing is with with this coalition um you know
[02:26:30.440 --> 02:26:34.440]  there are a lot of groups in the united states that that are influential and just aren't going
[02:26:34.440 --> 02:26:39.080]  to stand for it and so i think you're seeing a really interesting alliance between traditional
[02:26:39.080 --> 02:26:46.040]  civil liberties groups like the aclu um internet freedom groups like the e f f um and mozilla um
[02:26:46.040 --> 02:26:50.600]  as well as uh libertarian groups like young americans for liberty and students for liberty
[02:26:50.600 --> 02:26:54.920]  and libertarian party and you know i think uh as well as my group or sort of the fourth
[02:26:54.920 --> 02:26:58.520]  and i think what you're going to see is that there is this coalition forming of people who
[02:26:58.520 --> 02:27:02.760]  aren't going to stand for this well i agree and as you mentioned there's going to be free market
[02:27:02.760 --> 02:27:09.640]  solutions as as huge inventions get rolled out and fortunes are made countering this mozilla's
[02:27:09.640 --> 02:27:15.880]  light beam tool will expose who is looking over your shoulder on the web uh so many other exciting
[02:27:15.880 --> 02:27:21.160]  things being developed uh so you know the fact that this has been exposed and that and that now
[02:27:21.160 --> 02:27:26.280]  they have to admit this is happening uh i think this is the beginning of the end plus their spying
[02:27:26.280 --> 02:27:32.600]  is so great the new data center keeps catching on fire uh i mean literally the lines are burning
[02:27:32.600 --> 02:27:37.720]  up they're stealing so much data yeah well you'll love this alex so the uh the restore the fourth
[02:27:37.720 --> 02:27:43.160]  utah chapter actually you know how you can do adopt a highway yes they adopted the highway right
[02:27:43.160 --> 02:27:48.360]  outside the nsa's data center i saw that yeah there's a sign that says restore the fourth and
[02:27:48.360 --> 02:27:53.320]  they get to go out there in their t-shirts and hold signs while they pick up trash so um yeah i mean
[02:27:53.320 --> 02:27:57.320]  you know that's the thing is there's so many problems you know it's immoral what they're doing
[02:27:57.320 --> 02:28:02.200]  it's unconstitutional it doesn't even fit the laws that they're claiming it fits under and it also
[02:28:02.200 --> 02:28:07.400]  doesn't work i mean we've seen you know time and time again that when you try and throw this kind
[02:28:07.400 --> 02:28:12.360]  of this amount of data in one place you can't you can't figure anything out from it you're just you
[02:28:12.360 --> 02:28:17.880]  know you're just avalanched in data and apparently you know the the hardware can't even handle it so
[02:28:17.880 --> 02:28:22.920]  so you know it doesn't work it's illegal it's immoral it's unconstitutional and so i think uh
[02:28:22.920 --> 02:28:27.560]  you know this right is is going to be the first seven and really and then meanwhile big banks
[02:28:27.560 --> 02:28:31.880]  for laundering drug money not getting in trouble all this corruption is hiding in plain view and
[02:28:31.880 --> 02:28:36.120]  they won't do anything about that they're using it to try to control markets they're giving it to
[02:28:36.120 --> 02:28:42.520]  select corporations it's the industrial sabotage and the unfair trade advantage of the fortune 100
[02:28:42.520 --> 02:28:47.800]  being able to get this data and that's on record that's the real lawsuits right there that we've
[02:28:47.800 --> 02:28:53.480]  seen that that we're spying on other countries not just their their military leaders not just their
[02:28:53.480 --> 02:28:59.400]  presidents but also on their businesses um you know for economic advantage and so you know i think
[02:28:59.400 --> 02:29:04.840]  many times when when these programs get defended as as being against terrorism um you know they're
[02:29:04.840 --> 02:29:09.400]  also being used for economic advantages and for political i totally agree plus the globalism on
[02:29:09.400 --> 02:29:14.840]  our country aren't even giving us the american people the fruits of the stolen data uh they're
[02:29:14.840 --> 02:29:19.880]  they're offshoring the stuff they feel from the europeans to china uh it's amazing well we want to
[02:29:19.880 --> 02:29:24.680]  cover obviously sunday when i'm back on what you do tomorrow and uh folks can find out about the

[02:34:49.960 --> 02:34:56.680]  going pretty good my friend as am i as am i um i just wanted to uh say i received my uh
[02:34:57.560 --> 02:35:03.880]  nason iodine and uh my stack of uh info wars magazines first of all i wanted to share with
[02:35:03.880 --> 02:35:09.880]  the listeners that the iodine it tastes great tastes like honey uh by the way sir we've not been
[02:35:09.880 --> 02:35:14.360]  screening calls i want to be sure this because i mean did we screen your call when you called in
[02:35:15.720 --> 02:35:21.640]  no no he just asked me what the topic was and uh here i am on the air and that's just so they can
[02:35:21.640 --> 02:35:25.400]  if you want to volunteer and i can just get an idea of what you want to talk about but we go to
[02:35:25.400 --> 02:35:30.840]  everybody here on air unless sometimes i say it's on a particular topic and then they've got to say
[02:35:30.840 --> 02:35:35.320]  yeah i'm a military person or i'm a firefighter or i'm a school teacher or i'm a doctor you know
[02:35:35.320 --> 02:35:41.160]  giving their take on old on obama care or something but nine times out of ten it's totally on screen
[02:35:41.160 --> 02:35:48.200]  because we're getting huge listener feedback loving the iodine and listen i didn't mean to do a
[02:35:48.200 --> 02:35:51.640]  plug right now i want you to be able to talk about it uh i don't know if it's going to be positive
[02:35:51.640 --> 02:35:57.800]  or negative but go ahead and give us your review i'll go ahead ben give us your review you want
[02:35:57.800 --> 02:36:04.520]  to talk about the iodine well um i just got it to taste great like i said actually uh the main
[02:36:04.520 --> 02:36:10.520]  thing that i wanted to uh to talk about was uh one of the reoccurring themes that i always hear
[02:36:10.520 --> 02:36:16.680]  people call up and say what can i do alex what can i do and this is totally it's it's kind of
[02:36:16.680 --> 02:36:22.120]  ironic that i'm actually almost plugging another product but i had this experience the other day
[02:36:22.120 --> 02:36:27.720]  it's the first time that i've gotten a stack of magazines from you guys and it's not like i've
[02:36:27.720 --> 02:36:33.880]  got a bunch of extra money but one of the things that i always go back to is the one thing that
[02:36:33.880 --> 02:36:40.440]  everybody can do is obviously live the best the cleanest and the and work to be a force of good
[02:36:40.440 --> 02:36:45.960]  and all facets of your life and the second thing is to unlock people's minds as much as you possibly
[02:36:45.960 --> 02:36:52.040]  can so i figured you know this is the easy way for me to go ahead and do that um so i got my
[02:36:52.040 --> 02:36:58.040]  package in the mail with the iodine in the magazines and uh so i went to starbucks uh because i know
[02:36:58.040 --> 02:37:02.360]  that that's a that would be a good place to uh sit them around and then hopefully there are some
[02:37:02.360 --> 02:37:07.800]  open-minded people there who would be able to you know read the magazine enjoy it some will
[02:37:07.800 --> 02:37:12.360]  some will take it for what it is and uh maybe i'll unlock their minds some people might just
[02:37:12.360 --> 02:37:19.080]  throw it in the trash but uh so i go into starbucks with uh with five copies of magazines i want to
[02:37:19.080 --> 02:37:25.080]  spread them out all over town right so i go into starbucks i set one down on a couple of the tables
[02:37:25.080 --> 02:37:32.280]  and then i set three down on uh the like the community book center you know if you will of
[02:37:32.280 --> 02:37:37.480]  my local starbucks here and by the way we sell them at cost and they're big and colorful and flashy
[02:37:38.200 --> 02:37:42.040]  show that people can get them in bulk if they want and give them to people and so that's the
[02:37:42.040 --> 02:37:46.040]  whole point and will we save the world with that no but it's one more little thing notice how they
[02:37:46.040 --> 02:37:50.680]  want to make us a moral they want to dumb us down they want to break the family up they want to make
[02:37:50.680 --> 02:37:55.880]  us dependent you do the opposite of what they want that's how you defeat them it's very simple
[02:37:55.880 --> 02:38:00.120]  and you're right it's all of us doing little things so to make a long story short what happened
[02:38:01.480 --> 02:38:06.200]  i uh i put i put them down and i kind of just watched them out of the corner of my eye went up
[02:38:06.200 --> 02:38:12.840]  to the counter ordered my uh ordered my coffee and i saw two people pick up the magazines almost
[02:38:12.840 --> 02:38:17.480]  instantly and they hadn't seen me put them down there so nobody really knew who put them down so
[02:38:17.480 --> 02:38:24.680]  the first person was uh this older lady she took it she looked at the cover kind of confused look
[02:38:24.680 --> 02:38:30.600]  on her face looked at the back cover of uh prozac the killer clown uh and uh then she took it over
[02:38:30.600 --> 02:38:37.480]  the table sat down and started reading it and uh i tell you what thinking about it now and and even
[02:38:37.480 --> 02:38:42.440]  that it gave me goosebumps because you know maybe it was because of what i did that i unlocked this
[02:38:42.440 --> 02:38:48.280]  woman's mind now then we had the polar opposite happened and i'm hopefully hopefully i'm going
[02:38:48.280 --> 02:38:57.640]  to be able to channel your uh npr uh liberal phony liberal voice oh oh oh your friend so
[02:38:58.680 --> 02:39:06.120]  candy candy puppy get in the car here we are trendy so she comes she she takes one look and
[02:39:06.120 --> 02:39:10.680]  you know in typical liberal fashion she judges the look by its cover she sees what's on the outside
[02:39:10.680 --> 02:39:18.360]  and she goes oh my god look at what somebody left here oh my god what is this oh she takes it up to
[02:39:18.360 --> 02:39:27.320]  the counter of the starbucks man this burn this oh oh arrest whoever did it if trips love jesus
[02:39:27.320 --> 02:39:33.720]  arrest them that's liberal so what did she do she gets to the uh the manager behind the counter
[02:39:33.720 --> 02:39:41.000]  oh look what it says oh my god oh jeez oh the manager takes a look at it and pulls it
[02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:46.680]  naps and throws it in the trash now luckily they didn't notice the rest of the copies that i had
[02:39:46.680 --> 02:39:52.040]  left around the place and the woman who was reading the magazine actually saw the entire
[02:39:52.040 --> 02:39:57.000]  thing happen and she kept reading it and she read that magazine from the time that i was
[02:39:57.000 --> 02:40:01.400]  from the time that i ordered my coffee at the time they made it the time that i walked out
[02:40:01.400 --> 02:40:07.160]  and by the way we can show people the cover of the magazine it's a skull and it says obama care
[02:40:08.200 --> 02:40:11.800]  and i mean time magazine the stuff has to have way more provocative than that
[02:40:11.800 --> 02:40:17.480]  but the fact that it criticized the lord and savior that's not allowed because these are people
[02:40:17.480 --> 02:40:26.280]  are authoritarians simply amazing and so uh but but i'll bet you money after you left they dug
[02:40:26.280 --> 02:40:32.200]  that out of the trash and probably got passed around and read five times more see it i know all
[02:40:32.200 --> 02:40:36.520]  the people at starbucks and i i talk to them because they have the stack of the wall street
[02:40:36.520 --> 02:40:41.880]  journal the new york times and the local st louis rag the post dispatch and i always like
[02:40:41.880 --> 02:40:47.400]  take one of the covers and i show it to them and i kind of snicker and say you know this is actually
[02:40:47.400 --> 02:40:53.720]  you know not the way it is and you know it's this way and so the people at starbucks know that uh
[02:40:53.720 --> 02:41:00.120]  you know who i am and what i'm all about and you know usually uh you do kind of see a lot of people
[02:41:00.120 --> 02:41:04.840]  who are who are more slightly more intelligent i think than your normal average american in there
[02:41:04.840 --> 02:41:11.000]  so well brother and people can't afford you know buying magazines a dollar a piece 64 page big color
[02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:15.080]  glossy to give them to friends and family and i appreciate your call great story that's why
[02:41:15.080 --> 02:41:21.160]  you can do a two-sided print at a print shop for like a cent a piece or less isn't it and you could
[02:41:21.160 --> 02:41:28.360]  go get a hundred copies of a flyer with warning this is happening and then some websites and leave
[02:41:28.360 --> 02:41:34.520]  those out and it's even more devastating for your bang for your buck the magazine is made after you've
[02:41:34.520 --> 02:41:38.760]  read it to leave it a dental office leave it at a hair cutting place because you know the magazines
[02:41:38.760 --> 02:41:43.080]  send them free there because they get read a bunch of times uh so you go to the dental office leave
[02:41:43.080 --> 02:41:47.560]  one when you go to church leave one uh when you go to a restaurant leave one that's what we got 10
[02:41:47.560 --> 02:41:52.920]  packs up to 100 packs at cost but even if you can't even afford that it doesn't matter just speak
[02:41:52.920 --> 02:41:57.720]  out to people or when you're at the counter you know talk about hey all this sugar gum actually
[02:41:57.720 --> 02:42:03.960]  has aspartame but you know that gives you makes you go blind they count on us just getting in line
[02:42:03.960 --> 02:42:11.960]  if we all just start speaking out it's over it's over and same thing oh you're teaching that if
[02:42:11.960 --> 02:42:16.120]  you're in the tea party or if you give money to the tea party you're going to be court-martialed
[02:42:16.120 --> 02:42:19.640]  we're going to make a big deal out of that and the army goes okay we're reversing that
[02:42:19.640 --> 02:42:24.200]  well that's not enough there needs to be congressional investigations who should arrest
[02:42:24.200 --> 02:42:31.560]  people if they're an evangelical christian i mean in i mean cuba wasn't that bad if you
[02:42:31.560 --> 02:42:37.560]  were a christian in cuba they would kind of let you be one half what i mean that this is just i
[02:42:37.560 --> 02:42:44.520]  mean this is unbelievable i appreciate your call sir let's talk to alan in delaware alan you're on
[02:42:44.520 --> 02:42:50.520]  the air welcome hey alex so good to be back with you i just want to tell you man i don't have to
[02:42:50.520 --> 02:42:56.920]  ask you how you're doing you're doing a fantastic thing up job you know i want to just tell you
[02:42:56.920 --> 02:43:06.200]  as a testimonial to this nation i died 552 days ago i got this stuff two weeks ago my REM sleep
[02:43:06.200 --> 02:43:13.720]  and i'm not lying because i don't lie i don't have time for that bs i have had full eight hour
[02:43:13.720 --> 02:43:19.720]  full REM sleep every night for the past i was about to say dr group doesn't like to say too much
[02:43:19.720 --> 02:43:24.200]  about this special atomic iodine you know that's made with all the gas and the electricity and
[02:43:24.200 --> 02:43:28.040]  then the secret you know patented way they do it there's nothing else like another iodine
[02:43:28.040 --> 02:43:32.120]  tastes like rocket fuel folks and it's quite frankly poisonous the stuff you're from the store
[02:43:32.120 --> 02:43:36.920]  this stuff that's national academy of science is listed as one of a kind i did my research i
[02:43:36.920 --> 02:43:41.080]  brought you the best product it's why it's sold out people can preorder it it'll be back in a few
[02:43:41.080 --> 02:43:44.840]  weeks and i'm not trying to be a little calling about it i mean we just really promote good stuff
[02:43:44.840 --> 02:43:50.200]  gucciardi today goes my god i took two of the droppers of this what you're not supposed to do
[02:43:50.200 --> 02:43:56.120]  folks follow the indications and also talk to a physician before you take it okay he goes man
[02:43:56.120 --> 02:44:02.520]  i just went to basically he said the wildest dreams and that's what group says i'm not gonna get
[02:44:02.520 --> 02:44:07.640]  it all the stuff group says it's like point is try it we haven't gotten any complaints the only
[02:44:07.640 --> 02:44:11.880]  complaint is if you take a lot of it like i am you'll start detox and stuff starts coming out of
[02:44:11.880 --> 02:44:18.120]  your skin starts coming out other places and then uh you know uh if i take a lot of it sometimes it
[02:44:18.120 --> 02:44:21.880]  can give me a little bit of a stomach ache this is detoxing and and doctor group warned that would
[02:44:21.880 --> 02:44:27.080]  happen but uh as bad as i treat myself and i still look like a toad but people can really see the
[02:44:27.080 --> 02:44:32.440]  difference i mean this it's it's it's amazing but that's why the elite puts the the stuff on the
[02:44:32.440 --> 02:44:38.360]  same periodic table the boring the chlorine the fluoride in there because it literally blocks
[02:44:38.360 --> 02:44:45.400]  all your key glands that's why we call it survival shield because it doesn't just detox you it blocks
[02:44:45.400 --> 02:44:51.000]  all this other grud because it's electrical and it goes around grabbing all that stuff
[02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:57.000]  but i'm ranting tell me what it's doing to you well alice what it's done at 56 years old my site
[02:44:57.000 --> 02:45:05.000]  has gotten clearer i'm just stating a fact here no joke no bs no aspartame diet coke no crap for
[02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:10.680]  the last two and a half months i've dropped 30 pounds as an x bodybuilder i'm starting to define
[02:45:10.680 --> 02:45:15.480]  but let's get back to what we were talking about earlier was fukushima i've been looking at this
[02:45:15.480 --> 02:45:20.440]  for the last two days brother and i will tell you something it's so weird that i get on the phone with
[02:45:20.440 --> 02:45:28.760]  you and a half an hour ago they reported a 7.4 magnitude what do you think about gc in china
[02:45:28.760 --> 02:45:34.760]  with the emp systems and being on the fault lines of the earth of the the ring of fire
[02:45:35.320 --> 02:45:42.360]  and wanting to take out japan as a staunch american ally well sir god bless you and i
[02:45:42.360 --> 02:45:46.680]  appreciate your call uh then the last time they had fukushima the national media attacked me and
[02:45:46.680 --> 02:45:54.840]  said that i said it was a a tsunami bomb that is not what i said i said it was in the the
[02:45:54.840 --> 02:45:59.880]  london telegraph and in the australian it's called the australian newspaper
[02:46:01.400 --> 02:46:08.440]  about 10 years ago they declassified a plan to have tsunami bombs to attack the eastern
[02:46:08.440 --> 02:46:14.760]  soviet union or japan after world war two and they actually tested a tsunami bomb off the coast
[02:46:14.760 --> 02:46:20.680]  of some island chain the south pacific i forget the point is is that anybody can type in pentagon
[02:46:20.680 --> 02:46:25.720]  pentagon develop tsunami bombs you'll get london telegraph uh that that was the latest article
[02:46:25.720 --> 02:46:30.040]  that i was covering then and then that and then the white house run media groups came out and said
[02:46:30.040 --> 02:46:35.400]  that i said it was that i'm not saying i am not saying rachel madow nothing you even hurt me but
[02:46:35.400 --> 02:46:39.400]  you're just such liars you'll take it out of context i am not saying the new tsunami today
[02:46:39.400 --> 02:46:46.520]  and the new 7.6 or 7.3 it's varies earthquake was man-made i'm saying these technologies exist
[02:46:47.160 --> 02:46:52.680]  and it's suspicious and actually i'll search it let me just go over here if you type in uh man-made
[02:46:52.680 --> 02:46:59.160]  tsunami or pentagon planned uh man-made tsunami for japan it was after world war two you can pull
[02:46:59.160 --> 02:47:04.120]  it up let me see or while i go to a caller i'll pull that up uh you know just like i said there
[02:47:04.120 --> 02:47:08.520]  are weather weapons probably wasn't a weather weapon that hit oklahoma city but they did
[02:47:08.520 --> 02:47:13.800]  city but they do have weather weapons that's mainline news and then they said that i said it
[02:47:13.800 --> 02:47:19.160]  was a weather weapon so it's but but but yeah it is a little suspicious that it's the same spot over
[02:47:19.160 --> 02:47:23.400]  and over again but it is japan they build their houses out of paper in balsa wood for a reason
[02:47:23.400 --> 02:47:29.160]  i mean they built it on a fault line one of the biggest most i think they say it's arguably the

[02:54:14.040 --> 02:54:18.600]  i'll be hosting the nightly news tonight seven o'clock central on friday night
[02:54:19.480 --> 02:54:23.160]  i have a lot of breaking news on the tsunami i'm gonna go back to big ben here in a minute
[02:54:23.160 --> 02:54:27.000]  because i sound like he said i don't know if i should go on living this is the great challenge
[02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:31.000]  this is when you want to be alive facing all this evil this is what it's all about
[02:54:32.360 --> 02:54:37.720]  anthony gucciardi in the last few weeks has been talking about the record number of typhoons
[02:54:37.720 --> 02:54:41.320]  they call them hurricanes in our side of the world they're typhoons on the other side
[02:54:42.440 --> 02:54:47.000]  and they get up to over 200 miles an hour and are much more devastating as the pacific's obviously
[02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:57.640]  bigger so a pacific megastorm is a typhoon and atlantic is a hurricane they've got a huge one
[02:54:57.640 --> 02:55:05.080]  here's the rt story fukushima moves radioactive water as it races for typhoon francisco and on
[02:55:05.080 --> 02:55:11.480]  top of it a 7.6 or 7.3 there's different reports just went off off the coast about an hour and 10
[02:55:11.480 --> 02:55:17.880]  minutes ago and they're evacuating for that i i i hope nothing's going to hit them i guess we'll
[02:55:17.880 --> 02:55:23.320]  find out in the next 30 minutes or so uh but my point is is it what a horrible place and you were
[02:55:23.320 --> 02:55:27.160]  saying during the break while i drug you in or you're saying this is either divine or it's
[02:55:27.160 --> 02:55:31.400]  devilish and my whole point is there's the article tsunami bomb tested off busy on the coast all i'm
[02:55:31.400 --> 02:55:36.120]  saying is this stuff does exist and so msnbc has no right to attack me even though they're deceptive
[02:55:36.120 --> 02:55:40.600]  about what is admitted to be going on well the thing is this is such a perfect storm i mean
[02:55:40.600 --> 02:55:44.840]  not is it just the typhoon this typhoon francisco coming in and they're already bracing for us
[02:55:44.840 --> 02:55:48.440]  saying yeah the radio activity is insane it's going to go in the ocean it's going to go everywhere
[02:55:48.440 --> 02:55:54.040]  with this typhoon but then the typhoon is mixing with this weird cold weather streak that's up there
[02:55:54.040 --> 02:56:00.120]  so it's it's gaining mass it's gaining power that's going to come in anyway and attack type uh fukushima
[02:56:00.120 --> 02:56:04.280]  but then we have this weird earthquake that continues to be upgraded it was 6.8 then it was
[02:56:04.280 --> 02:56:09.800]  7.3 now they're saying 7.6 who knows what actually is that hits and now they're saying a tidal wave
[02:56:09.800 --> 02:56:14.520]  is going to hit along fukushima so we already have the typhoon and now we have an earthquake
[02:56:14.520 --> 02:56:19.320]  and a tidal wave i mean what what's next i mean is the star going to fall on fukushima i mean this
[02:56:19.320 --> 02:56:24.840]  is the perfect storm of events that are converging on fukushima right now oh wormwood all right
[02:56:24.840 --> 02:56:28.680]  i'm not stars falling thank you and we'll get more tonight on the nightly news thank you so much
[02:56:29.400 --> 02:56:36.520]  folks all i know is that that is why uh we have been uh warning people over and over again with
[02:56:36.520 --> 02:56:41.320]  what's happening uh in the northern hemisphere with the radiation levels more than double
[02:56:41.320 --> 02:56:45.640]  to protect your thyroid that's what got me into the model filing that we sell in m4store.com
[02:56:45.640 --> 02:56:50.600]  that's what got me into trying to find the best nascent iodine talking to all the top scientists
[02:56:50.600 --> 02:56:55.480]  and doctors and folks and then rediscovering dr group is right here in texas and finding this
[02:56:55.480 --> 02:57:02.680]  patented iodine that's sold out uh and it is just everybody trying to take care of themselves i sell
[02:57:02.680 --> 02:57:07.560]  water filters because they're the water filters i use i sell model filing and nascent iodine because
[02:57:07.560 --> 02:57:12.520]  it's the products i use and i believe in you just heard those testimonials of spontaneous people
[02:57:12.520 --> 02:57:16.760]  calling in maybe i should screen calls we don't have all those testimonials because we got news
[02:57:16.760 --> 02:57:22.040]  to cover it sounds ridiculous but that's really how good all this stuff is and it's not a silver
[02:57:22.040 --> 02:57:26.440]  bullet though it's just something to mitigate it other than moving to the southern hemisphere it just
[02:57:26.440 --> 02:57:31.480]  shows the insanity of what we're dealing with swim full wars store.com to find the model filing
[02:57:31.480 --> 02:57:37.400]  that we do have in stock that has the natural nascent iodine in it so that's m4store.com and
[02:57:37.400 --> 02:57:41.560]  regardless the radiation levels are up with reactors leaking here they don't care anymore
[02:57:41.560 --> 02:57:45.640]  everything's just falling apart with the spirit of evil that's taking everything over the bureaucrats
[02:57:45.640 --> 02:57:49.480]  don't even care anymore they're just delusional they just dance on the radiation they have the
[02:57:49.480 --> 02:57:53.640]  troops using the du they just don't care real fast finishing it with ben then i'll go into overdrive
[02:57:53.640 --> 02:57:58.680]  and take those other calls ben you're not saying you're going to hurt yourself and feel like there's
