[08:21.880 --> 08:28.920]  broadcast i come to you from my hometown of dallas texas uh here at the same hotel where
[08:28.920 --> 08:32.120]  dick chaney and other people are staying i've been running to them last night i'll tell you
[08:32.120 --> 08:37.640]  that story coming up later ran into one of the reporters for the drudge report uh as well we
[08:37.640 --> 08:41.800]  tried to crash the party and and i'm not kidding i'm actually going to tell you tell you that um
[08:42.920 --> 08:49.000]  tell you that story coming up uh wow here it is you know they said this uh a week ago but now
[08:49.000 --> 08:55.240]  they're in the u.s parents deny son's guilt and accuse us of plot no no actually they're still in
[08:55.240 --> 09:01.480]  russia saying that yesterday now they're coming this is in the new york times uh and um they go on
[09:01.480 --> 09:06.680]  to say the intelligence services had been on them for five years and had set them up and recruited
[09:06.680 --> 09:12.520]  them somehow and that is exactly what they do in false flags so there is the new york times
[09:12.520 --> 09:17.000]  with that piece of news we're going to be getting into that more uh today congressman ron paul is
[09:17.000 --> 09:25.240]  scheduled to join us at the start of the next hour and then we are also uh going to be getting uh
[09:25.240 --> 09:32.120]  seaball edmunds uh on the broadcast she was an fb i translator and uh witness them in the 9 11
[09:32.120 --> 09:37.480]  stand down and running al qaeda uh that's on record she had to break a federal gag order to bring
[09:37.480 --> 09:42.440]  that information out to you and people say well if stuff like this happened you know the government
[09:42.440 --> 09:48.120]  was involved in terror attacks we would we would know someone would talk a lot of people did talk
[09:48.120 --> 09:53.960]  and then they spin it and say chris matthew says alex jones says george w bush had like
[09:53.960 --> 10:00.520]  wiley coyote this is exact words uh with a plunger detonating it i'm not saying that george
[10:00.520 --> 10:06.200]  w bush even probably knew what was going on because i later talked to somebody who was with him in the
[10:06.200 --> 10:14.360]  bunker uh with another one of the bushes um that night after it happened when he was you know basically
[10:14.360 --> 10:19.000]  scaring around scared i'm not so much scared but but i mean he was either that or he's a great actor
[10:19.000 --> 10:24.600]  which i don't think towards w bush is but the people behind him the globalists that control
[10:24.600 --> 10:32.600]  presidents control societies they created al qaeda they run al qaeda and they are using the threat of
[10:32.600 --> 10:38.920]  al qaeda to basically take over our society and make everyone a suspect there's an article up
[10:38.920 --> 10:45.320]  at info wars dot com where a new fbi manual flyer says anyone taking pictures period or video anywhere
[10:45.320 --> 10:50.200]  is a suspected terrorist put them in a terrorist database and that's why the cops come up to you
[10:50.200 --> 10:55.880]  and arrest you now if you're you know videotaping the eiffel tower in paris or if you're videotaping
[10:55.880 --> 11:00.760]  the washington monument i've actually had the police come over we have this on tape put on the
[11:00.760 --> 11:05.160]  web you've seen it and say what are you doing and we're like well we're getting video of the
[11:05.160 --> 11:10.600]  washington monument why well i don't have to answer your questions in america but it's for my tv show
[11:10.600 --> 11:15.800]  do you have a permit for that and i was actually sitting there with a c-think film crew for the
[11:15.800 --> 11:20.840]  independent film channel and they and they looked at the cop and they go dc doesn't give permits
[11:22.520 --> 11:26.840]  because you don't need a permit to be in a public place or on the street with a camera
[11:26.840 --> 11:31.960]  you need a permit if you're gonna block a street and the cops said hey i'm gonna arrest you if you
[11:31.960 --> 11:39.240]  don't leave and so in america we left just because we were there to get a job done and weren't there
[11:39.240 --> 11:43.240]  to fight for the first amendment that day but maybe we should have gotten arrested maybe we need to
[11:43.240 --> 11:49.400]  stop giving in every time we get pushed around my point is it's about making us the suspects
[11:49.400 --> 11:54.280]  but the novel idea of could it be the government or could it be elements in the government or could
[11:54.280 --> 11:59.080]  it be defense contractors that want to sell trillions of dollars of more stuff and who want
[11:59.080 --> 12:06.040]  to make america the war zone and get paid ten billion dollars per company per year to spy on
[12:06.040 --> 12:12.680]  our email and spy on what we're saying this is all admitted now everything we talked about for so
[12:12.680 --> 12:19.960]  long is now admitted and so now i'm telling you what's coming next now i'm telling you what's
[12:19.960 --> 12:30.760]  coming next now again riding shotgun with us today our our jacari jackson and the
[12:32.200 --> 12:36.920]  other info wars nightly news reporter one of the other reporters david night and again our
[12:36.920 --> 12:42.040]  skype is a little bit catchy today so i want to ask the network every time my skype cuts out you
[12:42.040 --> 12:49.720]  go to backup skype will you give me a roger roger houston that i'm on the air okay roger
[12:49.720 --> 12:54.360]  roger that's great because when i see my screen go black and you guys are reconnecting uh what'd
[12:54.360 --> 13:03.240]  you go to backup skype there well done houston they're actually in austin but houston was close
[13:03.240 --> 13:09.000]  enough uh and again i'm here in dallas orbiting around dick chaney right now uh who is uh somewhere
[13:09.000 --> 13:14.120]  in the building i can't make up the weirdness of all this is it synchronicity or serendipity
[13:14.120 --> 13:23.960]  that i ran into uh dick chaney and george bush uh here in dallas or no it'd be like i ran into
[13:23.960 --> 13:27.960]  the super bowl what do you know i came to this town the super bowl is happening here this weekend
[13:27.960 --> 13:31.880]  no the presidential library is being opened and so that's why this happened i didn't even think
[13:31.880 --> 13:41.400]  of this by the way i was on my way uh yesterday on my way uh driving uh up here and right off
[13:41.400 --> 13:46.520]  i-35 is the town of west where that fertilizer plant blew up so we thought hey let's pull over at
[13:46.520 --> 13:51.640]  the check shop a place that has hot sandwiches uh that's a texas tradition and and and and about
[13:51.640 --> 13:57.720]  three blocks away is where the the fertilizer plant blew up so i i said let's drive by it well
[13:57.720 --> 14:02.120]  we go driving by it on a city street and the state police were even stopping firemen and
[14:02.120 --> 14:05.800]  stuff that were there for the funeral that had just ended and there were helicopters flying
[14:05.800 --> 14:09.800]  above because i was told obama had been there but he was gone and the state police came over
[14:09.800 --> 14:13.480]  with such pleasure and said what do you think you're doing here and we said well we're just
[14:13.480 --> 14:18.760]  driving by to see what's going on and uh he goes we can't go that way and i go okay well where do
[14:18.760 --> 14:24.120]  we turn around he goes well you can't turn around they start smiling at us so i jump up because
[14:24.120 --> 14:29.320]  richard was driving and peer out of the bus and i said oh so i'm an american scum you're enjoying
[14:30.040 --> 14:35.320]  me uh you know uh watching me squirm well i shot video of it you basically have seen it
[14:35.320 --> 14:40.280]  and people are like alex is a real wimp he drove all the way up to west and then when they told him
[14:40.280 --> 14:46.440]  leave he did no no no no no i am a wimp but not the way you think i am um i'm actually pretty
[14:46.440 --> 14:51.720]  pretty tough all right i'm being sarcastic folks not a lot of sleep i apologize the point is is
[14:51.720 --> 14:56.040]  that we were driving by and just thought we'd do a report for you so it's kind of a drive by
[14:56.760 --> 15:03.080]  literal drive by media but it just illustrates that then the his commander his superior comes over
[15:03.080 --> 15:08.360]  and goes yeah you can turn around right there and the other guy was starting to get mad like
[15:08.360 --> 15:11.880]  he was going to do something to us i'm because we're totally polite we're like no we're just
[15:11.880 --> 15:16.600]  driving by he goes why do you think you're going to do that well we're just okay we're just going
[15:16.600 --> 15:22.920]  to turn up there no you can't do that okay uh we're working we turn around well you can't turn
[15:22.920 --> 15:30.200]  around and then smiling at us i mean this is the essence of government it's like uh some a kid
[15:30.200 --> 15:35.720]  did using a magnifying glass to burn ants or something or pull the wings off a butterfly
[15:36.520 --> 15:41.640]  as bradley manning said about what the u.s. military does overseas i mean someday it'll be
[15:41.640 --> 15:48.360]  like total skynet robots bombing and destroying and killing everybody in third world countries
[15:48.360 --> 15:53.720]  i guess it's already happening and then occasionally there'll be a bomb go off and they'll hype it up
[15:53.720 --> 15:58.360]  like the nation just defeated some incredible threat so we have the perception that there was some
[15:58.360 --> 16:03.960]  type of uh you know external thing going on and that we're not really the big empire taking over
[16:03.960 --> 16:10.040]  the world and my biggest issue with the empire is not only is it immoral but this giant mega empire
[16:11.000 --> 16:18.040]  that we're seeing unfold here this giant mega empire we're paying for it and it's treating us
[16:18.040 --> 16:23.080]  just like it treats the other people uh that it's enslaving and destroying this is not even an
[16:23.080 --> 16:27.800]  american empire this is not an empire spreading liberty and freedom and the bill of rights and
[16:27.800 --> 16:33.400]  the constitution like the cia says we overthrow countries to spread democracy no you put dictators
[16:33.400 --> 16:40.680]  and al-qaeda in and now you run al-qaeda publicly in libya and syria and all over the place and
[16:42.120 --> 16:47.560]  and then lecture me how i'm unamerican to point out the global crime syndicate illegal mafia
[16:48.440 --> 16:55.640]  is sitting here uh now declaring that i'm the enemy as well i mean it's asinine meanwhile big siss
[16:55.640 --> 17:04.280]  homeland is using 1000 more rounds per person than the arming but uh she denies the ammunition
[17:04.280 --> 17:09.320]  purchases are aimed at civilians uh even though this military government and that's what it is
[17:10.040 --> 17:14.920]  is training to to fight the american people in all their manuals and all their drills
[17:14.920 --> 17:22.920]  you have enough ammo now to fight a 35 year war it was a 27 year war in iraq it's now a 35 year war
[17:22.920 --> 17:27.560]  they've gotten the over a billion delivered there's over a billion more that are on back order
[17:27.560 --> 17:31.640]  that they they're gonna get over the next few years and then they have these headlines everywhere
[17:31.640 --> 17:39.400]  alex jones discredited alex jones gets his day in congress congress takes up the conspiracy theory
[17:39.400 --> 17:46.600]  drudge report takes up the conspiracy theory the debunk theory about bullets and then you read
[17:46.600 --> 17:51.720]  about the bullets and they say yes we've bought two plus billion bullets and it's discredited that
[17:51.720 --> 17:56.600]  you said we did i mean i'm actually reading mainstream news going the discredited bullet
[17:56.600 --> 18:01.800]  story they're now having congressional hearings let's cut to that clip and then she says well
[18:01.800 --> 18:05.960]  we've bought them to save money but it's not aimed at the american people and you know the hollow
[18:05.960 --> 18:12.920]  points are illegal under the geneva convention uh they are for target practice when anyone knows

[24:51.880 --> 24:56.760]  that's how you pronounce it not so bell she says see bell and i respect how she wants it
[24:56.760 --> 25:01.960]  pronunciation so see bell edmunds is going to be joining us uh incredible whistleblower coming
[25:01.960 --> 25:06.760]  up at the bottom of the next hour and uh it's weird you know when i go on vacation i just kind
[25:06.760 --> 25:10.600]  of get in the screwy mood that's why i'm joking around a lot but literally i am in the same building
[25:10.600 --> 25:15.080]  as dick cheney right now and it's just like just a little man creeping around on a cane
[25:15.080 --> 25:18.280]  but but just think of all the new world order stuff he's been involved in
[25:18.280 --> 25:24.920]  just amazing how fragile life is how short it is people take themselves so incredibly seriously
[25:24.920 --> 25:31.000]  and then you've got the video up on info wars dot com uh that uh john bound and mark dice and
[25:31.000 --> 25:39.080]  jackson rob jackson went and produced and i i want to be clear they did that shoot in 15 minutes
[25:39.080 --> 25:45.480]  in oceanside california by la and that is all the people they talked to okay we did not go out
[25:45.480 --> 25:49.640]  there for five hours to find people that would sign a petition calling for america to be turned
[25:49.640 --> 25:53.880]  over to nazi germany and gun owners to be arrested and children to be injected with pure mercury
[25:54.440 --> 26:00.440]  we went to english-speaking people and explained it to them and they signed it because if you
[26:00.440 --> 26:06.840]  talk in a liberal voice a snake voice they're under a trance we're going to go out with a snake
[26:06.840 --> 26:12.040]  voice in austin and and we're going to call for babies babies to be killed in america up to age
[26:12.040 --> 26:19.640]  three we're going to call for a law so it's legal uh four babies and dice is uh doing another one
[26:19.640 --> 26:23.560]  well he's already done it he's going to have next week that's so controversial he doesn't know if
[26:23.560 --> 26:29.640]  he should even air it i mean what he asked them and they they they all agreed it was time to burn
[26:29.640 --> 26:36.440]  people murder people bury people um i just can't even believe it i i i don't want to give away what
[26:36.440 --> 26:41.000]  he did and and and again we're going to be doing this as well to illustrate how the public is in a
[26:41.000 --> 26:46.920]  zombified state and i got to say it it's liberals that are like this even mainline republicans that
[26:46.920 --> 26:52.040]  they've got their problems and want to kill all the muslims and have their issues they have common
[26:52.040 --> 27:01.160]  sense and street smarts i don't know i mean compared to democrats democrats are scary and they always
[27:01.160 --> 27:05.640]  walk around talking about how smart they are all day that's another thing they do and and they're not
[27:05.640 --> 27:11.240]  smart they're dangerous and they're crazy and i said we go to our guest host here who were there
[27:11.240 --> 27:15.800]  riding shotgun with us today they're going to be popping in with news alerts and little tidbits
[27:15.800 --> 27:19.960]  of information throughout the day but you know me in the first 30 minutes or so i just get warmed
[27:19.960 --> 27:24.920]  up babbling texas style hillbilly style david night jacari jackson what are you going to be
[27:24.920 --> 27:28.920]  interspersing today because you're going to be hosting a third hour all by your lonesomes today
[27:28.920 --> 27:36.360]  i'm jacari jackson here with david night just like alex said that we have a few articles that
[27:36.360 --> 27:43.960]  we'll be conducting a little bit later fbi conducts gun sweeps in oakland dhs and fbi warn of terrorist
[27:43.960 --> 27:47.960]  with cameras following boston bombing now this is exactly what we said what happened
[27:47.960 --> 27:52.040]  and you have the mad house and other people of the world saying this is they said this was going
[27:52.040 --> 27:56.280]  to be used to take your rights or something and that's exactly what it is i'm sick of that dude
[27:56.280 --> 28:01.960]  saying that we're wrong and that i'm sick of that him he has a man he needs to gut up and admit we've
[28:01.960 --> 28:09.880]  been told the truth david what do you have well there's news that the u.s. mint is suspending
[28:09.880 --> 28:14.840]  sales of small gold coins at the same time premiums are rising so it's going to be interesting we're
[28:14.840 --> 28:18.840]  going to have ron paul on later so it'll be interesting to see i know he follows gold pretty
[28:18.840 --> 28:23.560]  closely what he makes out of all the shortages of gold and silver and of course we know what's
[28:23.560 --> 28:27.400]  happening with ammo and there's an article about that on info war today and the thing about that i
[28:27.400 --> 28:32.360]  think bloomberg was on i mean uh ron paul was on bloomberg a couple days ago and they kept asking
[28:32.360 --> 28:35.960]  ron paul ron paul why do you like gold and he told him why he likes gold and why do you like gold
[28:35.960 --> 28:39.720]  and then they switched anchors and just kept asking him the same question over and over and i think
[28:39.720 --> 28:44.760]  we actually i don't get why they do that i was on obian anthony show i think they do it and like
[28:44.760 --> 28:50.840]  eight times norton kept asking me the same question and i don't even know what that tactic is i don't
[28:50.840 --> 28:54.360]  know i guess they were trying to see if he would change his answer and he always had you know like
[28:54.360 --> 29:00.200]  always he always had a will uh well thought out thought provoking answer but they just weren't
[29:00.200 --> 29:07.880]  satisfied with his answer you know alex you were talking about uh how dumb down everything is in
[29:07.880 --> 29:12.840]  the wake of this bombing the analysis of it and there was an article that was on uh lou rockwell's
[29:12.840 --> 29:18.040]  page from butler schaefer and he said perhaps we ought to change the motto of the us from in god we
[29:18.040 --> 29:23.160]  trust to ignorance is bliss he said the failure in intelligence wasn't the fact that the fbi and the
[29:23.160 --> 29:27.720]  cia and homeland security and all these other agencies had indicators that something was up
[29:27.720 --> 29:35.000]  with one of these brothers failure in intelligence is the american people abdicating uh their ability
[29:35.000 --> 29:40.440]  to look at information i disagree with that i think we should worship the image of not a golden
[29:40.440 --> 29:47.240]  calf but of an ostrich with its head in the sand or it's head in the toilet with a dead baby yeah
[29:47.240 --> 29:51.960]  we could replace the eagle with an ostrich and the motto with the we're on the march the empires on

[33:36.840 --> 33:41.160]  here and then we're going to have jacari jackson and david night there in austin texas break down
[33:41.160 --> 33:46.120]  some other important breaking news they have like planned parenthood running around saying hey women
[33:46.120 --> 33:52.600]  wear shirts saying i had an abortion absolutely i sacrificed my child i killed my child i'm proud
[33:52.600 --> 33:57.560]  of it because you see they're losing the battle statistics and studies are showing people are
[33:57.560 --> 34:02.680]  turning against abortion i'm not judging women that have had them i'm not saying that you're a
[34:02.680 --> 34:08.120]  murderer i'm saying you were manipulated into this and now they're trying to make it something
[34:08.120 --> 34:13.080]  that's like laudable like getting a gold medal or something and in every culture people have been
[34:13.080 --> 34:19.640]  lauded for killing their children that's just something that's happened over and over and over
[34:19.640 --> 34:26.760]  again throughout civilization and in different different cultures so what i want to do actually
[34:26.760 --> 34:34.120]  right now is throw it over to jacari jackson and david night what i want to cover first is gentlemen
[34:34.120 --> 34:40.360]  the latest developments that we were first talking about you know back last monday during the tragic
[34:41.160 --> 34:46.360]  you know first hours the bombing we said if there's a drill if the patsies were in intelligent
[34:46.360 --> 34:52.360]  services or protected by them if they use it for some big power grab like marshal law
[34:53.800 --> 35:01.880]  to to basically condition uh if that happens if we see all of these all of these different
[35:02.520 --> 35:09.560]  telltale signs then we know it's an inside job or at least a provocateur event which is a type of
[35:09.560 --> 35:16.040]  type of inside job and indeed ladies and gentlemen that is what has now happened and if you look at
[35:16.040 --> 35:24.120]  the new york times parents deny son's guilt and accuse us of plot well ladies and gentlemen that's
[35:24.120 --> 35:31.480]  just the simple facts that one brother was killed the other climbed out of a boat and was just fine
[35:31.480 --> 35:36.760]  and then suddenly had his throat cut out and now what what the senator first said back on
[35:36.760 --> 35:48.360]  uh tuesday uh is now uh mainstream news that that all these agencies cia fbi you name it all knew
[35:49.000 --> 35:55.240]  exactly who these guys were and were quote following them tracking them the russians
[35:55.240 --> 35:59.160]  blew their cover and said who are these guys and then it came out two days ago and has been
[35:59.160 --> 36:03.720]  in no mainstream media except foreign russian news they released the documents out of georgia
[36:03.720 --> 36:12.520]  that indeed tamerlin uh zardav the the older brother uh indeed was in cia sponsored uh
[36:12.520 --> 36:17.880]  jamestown association groups under zebigny brzezinski whose plan it is to radicalize
[36:17.880 --> 36:23.480]  muslims and use them worldwide as the tool to take liberties here in america uh in the middle east
[36:23.480 --> 36:27.880]  and against russia and again people say what are you saying there aren't radical muslims my whole
[36:27.880 --> 36:34.120]  world's about hating muslims and you know my dog's got an al-qadadi chuteau no no no i'm not saying
[36:34.120 --> 36:38.840]  there aren't radical muslims and there isn't a clash of civilizations what i'm saying is the
[36:38.840 --> 36:43.640]  globalists are throwing fuel on the fire as a way to take our liberties and have an excuse for all
[36:43.640 --> 36:50.600]  these wars and empires and they use them like a swiss army knife or a skeleton key for every job
[36:50.600 --> 36:55.160]  going back like i mean this goes back to the british using radical muslims out of saudi arabia
[36:55.160 --> 36:59.400]  to overthrow the different countries that were there before turning into one big country and
[36:59.400 --> 37:05.080]  now they've used those guys worldwide hitler took over the middle east for oil uh during the start
[37:05.080 --> 37:09.240]  of world war two and rommel went in and for the few years he had it before he got kicked down
[37:10.120 --> 37:15.080]  what did they do they set up and expanded the muslim brotherhood now at the end of world war
[37:15.080 --> 37:20.600]  two the keys got handed from hitler over to the united states uh and then israel was set up basically
[37:20.600 --> 37:24.680]  as a command base over there whether you support israel or don't or whether you just want peace over
[37:24.680 --> 37:30.120]  there the point is it was set up as like an aircraft carrier uh you know out there in the middle east
[37:30.120 --> 37:35.080]  to basically be a base of military operations and again this wasn't done to democratize or bring
[37:35.080 --> 37:39.720]  freedom over there it was done to put radical muslims in charge look what we did kicking out
[37:39.720 --> 37:44.360]  mubarak who wasn't a great guy a western back dictator but he was a dictator you know back
[37:44.360 --> 37:48.920]  when the u.s wasn't as as openly evil you know i mean we had corrupt people in there but they
[37:48.920 --> 37:54.040]  weren't just absolutely pure evil uh now he's gone after 31 years and they then they're putting
[37:54.040 --> 38:00.040]  basically al-qaeda light in so that's my take on that but this is a case of this is absolutely come
[38:00.040 --> 38:05.800]  out uh in the open and i want you guys to spend about five minutes breaking that down and i want
[38:05.800 --> 38:09.640]  the guys to bring me down while you're doing that because i want to readjust my camera it actually
[38:09.640 --> 38:15.800]  fell off the computer here so i have to read all right we're here i think you know picking up on
[38:15.800 --> 38:20.680]  what elix was talking about here's some of the agencies according to the official story that
[38:20.680 --> 38:27.080]  knew about this attack he had the fbi the cia u.s customs and border protection boston joint
[38:27.080 --> 38:32.760]  terror task force tide that's a terrorist identities datamart at datamart environment
[38:33.320 --> 38:39.240]  and homeland security itself all of these people were had red flags raised to them about tamerlan
[38:39.240 --> 38:44.440]  the older brother and yet they didn't catch anything now in the polytunnel said that she
[38:44.440 --> 38:49.000]  knew about it but she didn't think it was a big deal yeah yeah janet you failed us all right
[38:49.000 --> 38:53.240]  homeland security failed us if you even look if you if you don't look at anything else but the
[38:53.240 --> 38:58.440]  official story you have to say that homeland security which was created 12 years ago in the
[38:58.440 --> 39:03.080]  aftermath of 9 11 the whole rationale for the creation of homeland security was that we've
[39:03.080 --> 39:06.920]  got all these bureaucracies that aren't sharing information with each other that aren't communicating
[39:06.920 --> 39:12.360]  with each other so we need one gigantic bureaucracy to rule them all okay and that's what we've got
[39:12.360 --> 39:16.680]  with homeland security and guess what they're offering the same excuse they did 12 years ago
[39:16.680 --> 39:21.720]  so why do we spend all this money on homeland security why do we centralize all this investigation
[39:21.720 --> 39:26.520]  i mean at that very level their story has no credibility and we should not be handing over
[39:26.520 --> 39:30.920]  any liberty to them at all and we should take back the liberties that they took because we're
[39:30.920 --> 39:35.240]  it wasn't a very good exchange for us and that's exactly the point because not just terrorism
[39:35.880 --> 39:40.040]  databases but all kinds of databases you have the nsa data mining centers and all this stuff
[39:40.040 --> 39:45.800]  and even with all the the information they illegally collect on us citizens they still can't
[39:45.800 --> 39:49.880]  you know keep people from committing crimes and you know i'm not necessarily referring to the
[39:49.880 --> 39:54.040]  boston bombing suspects but just in general they can't keep people from committing the crimes with
[39:54.040 --> 39:59.960]  all the resources that they have well even if you look at the war on drugs you have scores of people
[39:59.960 --> 40:05.960]  dying from drug overdoses in federal prisons every year if they can't stop the flow of drugs
[40:05.960 --> 40:11.000]  in prisons to the extent that inmates can not only get drugs but get enough of them to have an
[40:11.000 --> 40:15.960]  overdose what kind of a society would we have to live in for them to be able to interdict drugs to
[40:15.960 --> 40:20.920]  protect us from ourselves so the whole idea of using force and interdiction to stop everything
[40:20.920 --> 40:27.560]  is a failed idea but it's just when you look at even the no fly list and the absurdity of that
[40:27.560 --> 40:33.960]  the fact that this tides thing flagged tamlin when he was heading back to russia and and they
[40:33.960 --> 40:38.680]  decided to let him fly anyway and yet you have children who are put on the no fly list you have
[40:38.680 --> 40:43.560]  wade hicks who had just been vetted by homeland security had been vetted by the fbi for enhanced
[40:44.120 --> 40:50.040]  security checks and was stopped mid journey to japan to see his wife in the military and stranded
[40:50.040 --> 40:55.880]  in hawaii because he couldn't fly anywhere never was given any explanation so this kind of authoritarian
[40:55.880 --> 41:00.840]  bureaucracy that doesn't pay any attention to the law and just rides rough shot over people
[41:00.840 --> 41:05.720]  is accountable to no one and will not tell anybody to this day people who are put on the no fly list
[41:05.720 --> 41:09.960]  are not ever told if they're ever taken off of it they're never told why they were even put on it
[41:09.960 --> 41:14.600]  it's like some kind of a star chamber where you're accused in absentia and but at least the star
[41:14.600 --> 41:18.520]  chamber would tell people what they were accused of we don't even get that from homeland security
[41:18.520 --> 41:22.680]  and you you brought up a good point and you said that they're not accountable to anybody and we saw
[41:22.680 --> 41:26.680]  that with napolitano when she was being grilled by i believe the congressman and he said you know
[41:26.680 --> 41:30.600]  what's what's up with this side guys she says well if i think it's a big deal i'll get around to
[41:30.600 --> 41:34.840]  telling you yeah it's a big deal yeah sit down congressman don't talk to me and that's kind of
[41:34.840 --> 41:38.440]  the attitude that you're getting about these ammunition purchases as well right when they say
[41:38.440 --> 41:43.240]  you know why are you getting a thousand times why are you using if you're divided out by the
[41:43.240 --> 41:47.320]  number of people there why are you using a thousand times more rounds than the army's using you know
[41:47.320 --> 41:51.240]  well i can't tell you that i'm not going to tell you that and i think that's a very good point to
[41:51.240 --> 41:56.280]  bring up i mean when you're using more more rounds domestically than you need in a foreign
[41:56.280 --> 42:01.560]  occupation i mean that's a pretty pretty big deal and nobody wants to talk about that they don't
[42:01.560 --> 42:06.360]  want to talk about the fully automatic ar-15s they don't want to talk about the armored vehicles and
[42:06.360 --> 42:10.120]  you know everybody well not everybody but you see some of the naysayers saying well they bought
[42:10.120 --> 42:15.240]  dump trucks too and i'm okay yeah they bought dump trucks they also have armored vehicles that they
[42:15.240 --> 42:20.360]  say can withstand mines landmines they said they need those for warrants sweeps i know a lot of the
[42:20.360 --> 42:25.160]  the crypts in the bloods like to use landmines and their daily activities and whatnot that makes
[42:25.160 --> 42:29.320]  absolutely no sense but i want to get to this david we have a link and drudge maybe you guys can
[42:29.320 --> 42:35.480]  pull it up update falsely identified boston bomber found dead in the river and i believe alex has been
[42:35.480 --> 42:39.400]  talking about this for some time saying that you know bodies are going to pop up in the river and
[42:39.400 --> 42:45.240]  sure enough they did falsely identified boston bomber found dead in river one of the individuals
[42:45.240 --> 42:51.080]  identified as a possible boston bombing accomplice has been found dead in the providence river police
[42:51.080 --> 42:55.400]  and providence pulled a man's body from the providence river on tuesday and authorities said
[42:55.400 --> 43:01.320]  it's very possible that it is but forgive me for this uh pronunciation suddenly
[43:01.960 --> 43:08.120]  for potty a former brown university student who has been missing since mid march it was pointed
[43:08.120 --> 43:13.160]  out that the image bore a similarity to one of the suspects first named by the fbi and i remember
[43:13.160 --> 43:16.600]  remember we had the caller call in the other day and he said you know maybe we should do some
[43:16.600 --> 43:20.440]  crowd sourcing and i don't think crowd sourcing is necessarily a bad thing but when you get to
[43:20.440 --> 43:24.600]  the point where you're harassing people in the very scenario i gave that caller was you know
[43:24.600 --> 43:27.720]  you they're going to start harassing little girls with backpacks you know that the little girl had
[43:27.720 --> 43:32.600]  a black backpack and it's it gets way out of hand but i think it can be a very useful thing just
[43:32.600 --> 43:37.000]  something to use with extreme caution well we have an article on info wars from curtain ammo
[43:37.000 --> 43:42.120]  and he says the dhs and fbi warning of terrorists with cameras following the boston bombing now
[43:42.120 --> 43:47.560]  we just had peter king former uh chair of the house committee on homeland security saying that
[43:47.560 --> 43:51.800]  well you know we could have stopped this or found these guys quicker if we had more cameras well
[43:51.800 --> 43:56.040]  they had a lot of cameras at the finish line and they confiscated they confiscated cameras
[43:56.040 --> 44:01.000]  from people who were there just film it right what they don't want they don't want a free press
[44:01.000 --> 44:05.560]  they don't want a free citizenry they don't want people taking pictures of their crime scenes
[44:05.560 --> 44:10.200]  because they want to control what information comes out and what information doesn't and along
[44:10.200 --> 44:16.440]  that line we look at this the implausibility of this this uh these two brothers the second one
[44:16.440 --> 44:20.600]  with a white backpack now immediately it was obvious because for days they've been talking
[44:20.600 --> 44:25.640]  about a black backpack and then when they flagged these guys they didn't say anything initially
[44:25.640 --> 44:29.880]  about the second guy having a white backpack right and uh so we started talking about it
[44:29.880 --> 44:33.640]  and then immediately cnn comes on with an explanation says well this is what it would
[44:33.640 --> 44:38.680]  have been i think it was less than an hour yeah after that press conference right cnn came up with
[44:38.680 --> 44:46.760]  their own uh probable cause situation for why the backpack was white and not the black backpack
[44:46.760 --> 44:50.520]  i mean this was nothing that they got from the fbi that we know of it's just something they came up
[44:50.520 --> 44:55.960]  on their own yeah they just put the bags out of bags they did have an fbi uh uh former fbi
[44:55.960 --> 45:02.040]  profiler as they they introduced an fbi profiler i want to tell this story i've told it to david
[45:02.040 --> 45:06.040]  and i told it to the guys in the back back when i was in college i wouldn't say i was recruited
[45:06.040 --> 45:10.120]  by the fbi but the fbi approached me at a career fair you know because i was studying
[45:10.120 --> 45:13.640]  criminal justice and said hey you know when you get your degrees you come check out the fbi
[45:13.640 --> 45:17.400]  and you're not just asking basic question you know what about all that fbi profiling i see on
[45:17.400 --> 45:25.160]  the moves he said there is no position in the fbi called fbi profiler none and you can verify that
[45:25.160 --> 45:30.200]  at the fbi's website we went there and looked at fbi it's the careers section and if you look at
[45:30.200 --> 45:35.400]  item number 17 because i must get this request a lot it says i'd like to be an fbi profiler and
[45:35.400 --> 45:40.600]  they say there is no such job as an fbi profiler but they had an fbi profiler according to cnn
[45:40.600 --> 45:45.560]  yeah he is an fbi profiler if you guys can dig that up that would be really great even if we have
[45:45.560 --> 45:49.960]  to wait till the next segment so he came on and he he was ready with a demonstration now here's
[45:49.960 --> 45:55.160]  the question okay i think that's somewhat implausible but he's saying that uh you know he had the black
[45:55.160 --> 46:00.840]  backpack in with a bomb inside it inside of a white backpack he would take that out and then
[46:01.400 --> 46:06.360]  leave it down there and then put the white backpack on and go okay well if he was so clever to do that
[46:06.360 --> 46:11.960]  why didn't the older brother who is a mastermind why didn't he do the same thing okay why didn't
[46:11.960 --> 46:18.280]  he have a white backpack with a black backpack bomb inside of it i mean it just it makes no sense
[46:18.280 --> 46:23.800]  and we're told that they don't have any video of the older brother setting anything down but we do
[46:23.800 --> 46:28.200]  have they say video of the younger brother setting something down but nobody has seen
[46:28.200 --> 46:33.800]  exactly they will not show you the video now now think about this no person identified by the name
[46:33.800 --> 46:39.880]  in the investigation is saying that they saw the videos okay the governor of massachusetts said that
[46:39.880 --> 46:45.960]  he went to a briefing and they described the video to him but they didn't show the governor of
[46:45.960 --> 46:50.840]  massachusetts oh my gosh they described it yeah they described it so that's some damning evidence
[46:50.840 --> 46:57.320]  right there they described a video that nobody's saying but that's the whole point of the suspicion
[46:57.320 --> 47:03.240]  about the younger brother so zohar is this video where he supposedly took this backpack out of the
[47:03.240 --> 47:08.840]  other one and left it on ran it's crazy also guys again alex jones popping back in here
[47:08.840 --> 47:14.600]  guys great points you're making is you have the police chief you know the big guy uh that everybody
[47:14.600 --> 47:21.640]  sees the press conferences he said on fox that he had the whole video of this uh described to him
[47:21.640 --> 47:27.640]  first he said it is just chilling and riveting a video and they said oh you've seen it well no no no
[47:27.640 --> 47:34.120]  no i hadn't described to me but listen all that is sad issues i think it's important list at all
[47:34.120 --> 47:38.680]  as part of the overall continuum of this but you have to understand you've got a drill at the exact
[47:38.680 --> 47:43.240]  same time you've got them desperate to cover up that drill you've got all these other people with
[47:43.240 --> 47:47.880]  backpacks there which again are part of the drill we're not saying they're in on it they're there
[47:47.880 --> 47:52.360]  so that no one can ever find the real guy with a bomb so the real guy can slip in how do you
[47:52.360 --> 47:56.920]  in a country in a world where they know there's going to be thousands of cameras they want the
[47:56.920 --> 48:02.040]  thousands of cameras to create all this fear to usher in a fundamental change in our society
[48:02.040 --> 48:06.440]  towards open martial law they'll just call it security they'll call it public safety how do
[48:06.440 --> 48:12.680]  you how do you have that fundamental shit well you got to have the footage but how do you then
[48:12.680 --> 48:17.480]  bomb something and then get your backpack bombs in or whatever they were really in
[48:17.480 --> 48:22.440]  and then have the real perpetrator be able to slip out you have it's the old spy trick of have
[48:22.440 --> 48:28.440]  20 people show up at the same restaurant dress the same way so that people can't find out who's
[48:28.440 --> 48:36.440]  handing off a package this is all classic spy stuff out of real spy craft to have the drill
[48:36.440 --> 48:40.680]  in case you get caught to say you're part of the drill and then i say okay there's a drill
[48:40.680 --> 48:45.560]  that just bumped it up to 90 chance i said this you know the day it happened okay a drills confirmed
[48:45.560 --> 48:52.600]  people are saying drills okay the the the boston globe admitted that there was a drill they had
[48:52.600 --> 48:57.160]  a drill years before they're the same thing happening okay that just bumps up to 90 percent
[48:57.160 --> 49:01.320]  because you know if you have a drill the exact same place exact same time of a bombing that's
[49:01.320 --> 49:05.960]  what it was for unbelievable you're at 90 percent now if it comes out they're being shadowed by the
[49:05.960 --> 49:12.440]  fbi and cia the curtain emo rope if they were sent by these foundations that are trying to undermine
[49:12.440 --> 49:18.200]  russia by sending in muslim extremists and we listed the organizations then it goes to 99 percent
[49:18.200 --> 49:23.400]  and folks it's gone to 99 percent and then you get them covering up trying to kill the brothers
[49:24.120 --> 49:29.400]  silencing the other brother dead bodies popping up the cover up of this saudi that somehow was
[49:29.400 --> 49:34.360]  involved i don't know it was a patsy or maybe the target i mean we don't know but we know this guy
[49:34.360 --> 49:39.320]  is at the white house we know michelle is visiting him the first lady we know this guy
[49:39.320 --> 49:44.440]  is on no fly list because again you've got agencies that aren't actually terrorists
[49:44.440 --> 49:49.560]  that will pick up on these people and put them on a list or they've done this they put them on a list
[49:49.560 --> 49:53.800]  so when something gets blown up or they want to set them up later they say oh look we were
[49:53.800 --> 49:58.120]  watching them that's then uses the proof against them as well and the fact that they're allowed to
[49:58.120 --> 50:04.680]  get on and off planes tamerlan is the older brother with fake names boom ladies and gentlemen
[50:04.680 --> 50:10.680]  we know the workshops he attended with the cia we know what he did we know he went around a mosque
[50:10.680 --> 50:16.920]  just to jump up and say i want to kill infidels to test and see if there were real radicals in
[50:16.920 --> 50:22.200]  those mosques but see when you get hired because they were secular at first party guys you know
[50:22.200 --> 50:26.680]  wanting to get money be playboy type guys you know they were rock stars they're out partying
[50:26.680 --> 50:31.720]  they're not real muslims the point is when you go out and take part in the drills or when you take
[50:31.720 --> 50:36.440]  part as an infiltrator posing as a muslim extremist you are now creating the history
[50:36.440 --> 50:42.120]  and the ledger to be set up that's what happened with tim mcvay lee harvey oswald and everybody
[50:42.120 --> 50:47.800]  else this is a total intelligence operation it is a false flag and when we come back i'll tell you
[50:47.800 --> 50:52.840]  the motive for it then we'll get into the latest on the bullets uh the media is in full panic mode
[50:52.840 --> 50:57.880]  trying to cover this up they are preparing for war against the american people folks and if this
[50:57.880 --> 51:04.760]  story gets out it's over for them we travel so much and having a fake tv well it gives added
[51:04.760 --> 51:11.320]  peace of mind burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets but fake tv can full even

[54:35.320 --> 54:38.600]  from the boston bombing to his new homeschooling curriculum to where he thinks the new world
[54:38.600 --> 54:42.680]  order is going and what's happening with gold that is all coming up with former congressman
[54:42.680 --> 54:47.640]  dr ron paul and then we have c bell edmunds the whistleblower coming on look you all know the
[54:47.640 --> 54:53.240]  motives set the precedent as they said this is like 9 11 you even see the pr rollout we're now
[54:53.240 --> 54:57.960]  going to be on the streets you're now all suspects and what do you say to that having
[54:57.960 --> 55:08.600]  the bill of rights suspended usa usa usa cheering tyranny with the chance of usa usa usa so the
[55:08.600 --> 55:15.960]  motive is let the military industrial complex eat america fully this far and offshore bank owned
[55:15.960 --> 55:21.800]  monstrosity that is installing al-qaeda and libyan syria so we can fight the next war with them
[55:21.800 --> 55:26.280]  so it's full spectrum dominance and it's a way to make us all suspects and then get syspa
[55:27.080 --> 55:32.200]  passed and and and just absolutely butcher the bill of rights and constitution and distract
[55:32.200 --> 55:36.920]  from uh obama imploding america and shutting down our power plants and shipping our jobs overseas
[55:36.920 --> 55:40.680]  so it's all meant to make us rally around and see the government as the daddy as the mommy
[55:40.680 --> 55:44.600]  as chris rock said you know obama's like your dad so shut up and do what he says
[55:45.960 --> 55:50.040]  you know kim jong il kim jong un he's like our dad so shut up and do what he says
[55:50.040 --> 55:54.360]  you know hitler he's like our dad shut up and do what he says i mean that's what every
[55:54.920 --> 55:59.960]  group that loves authoritarianism says and you watch that video up at info wars dot com that
[55:59.960 --> 56:06.120]  has to go viral everywhere californians sign petition to bring in nazi rule and they would
[56:06.120 --> 56:10.200]  say yeah please sign the petition to confiscate the guns and bring in nazi fascism in america
[56:10.840 --> 56:17.000]  and these are people that spoke english black hispanic you name it uh white uh mainly whites
[56:17.000 --> 56:22.280]  and hispanics uh and and and that's that's the people that's everyone that we asked it's not
[56:22.280 --> 56:27.400]  like we're cherry picking here they were out there 15 minutes it's like a seven minute video
[56:27.400 --> 56:30.120]  because they just you know cut out the parts where they were waiting for somebody to walk up on the
[56:30.120 --> 56:37.160]  boardwalk everyone we talked to except for one group of people uh so that's like 90 percent said
[56:37.160 --> 56:42.120]  we want to take the guns to live under nazi rule because they don't know even what nazis are
[56:42.120 --> 56:46.120]  it's like it's for the earth the children the nazis will run everything and take the guns
[56:46.120 --> 56:52.360]  oh i'm for that thank you thank you for supporting the nazis ma'am and and it's we're gonna get more

[01:00:56.360 --> 01:01:00.120]  and co-host even when i'm there because i enjoy their ideas and banter and it's thought-provoking
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:05.640]  uh but jacari jackson and david night uh are riding shotgun up there also uh in case that we
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:11.400]  have any technical difficulties because we are coming to you via the internet uh right now the
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:19.720]  wonders of the internet uh and we do have and we do have congressman ron paul uh joining us
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:25.160]  today again i'm on the road so i have a couple of my info wars nightly news reporters riding shotgun
[01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:29.960]  with us of the next 30 minutes in case anything cuts out they'll be able to ask the congressman
[01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:33.720]  former congressman questions uh it's great to have you on with us today sir thank you
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:39.800]  wow so much is happening i want to get into your homeschooling curriculum i hope to
[01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:43.000]  actually promote it later when you start that affiliate program i think everybody should get
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:48.040]  involved in that but before we go there what do you make of boston and that whole marshal law
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:54.520]  spectacle that we saw well it's rather scary you know me that i always try to look on the
[01:01:54.520 --> 01:02:00.520]  positive things and think things can't be quite as bad but those pictures really concerned me
[01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:06.280]  you know i mean that is such a visual image when you see these thousands and thousands of troops
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:13.400]  and they weren't your local friendly policemen that were involved and it was uh accepted too
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:19.000]  easily i mean can you imagine all these people being locked and became prisoners and then the
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.440]  police the military police were a lot of marching to any house anytime without a search warrant
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:32.520]  it was uh marshal law you know uh so i think it was very very scary that's just that's just hope
[01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:37.480]  it wakes up some people but unfortunately you still hear those well the government has to
[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:43.560]  do something to make us safe and i think i think that's where the big big disconnect is is what
[01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:48.680]  is the purpose of government is to give us perfect safety and perfect economic security
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:52.680]  or is it there to allow us to run our own lives and protect our liberties
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:58.040]  i want to expand on that because we're going to break uh here in a moment this is our short
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:03.720]  segment again former congressman and dr ron paul uh joins us are very active in the defense of
[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:08.600]  liberty uh i want to expand again in the next segment on the boston issue because some stations
[01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:14.120]  join us then i want to you know get your full take on that but i mean clearly any excuse the
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:20.120]  the the the power structure has to grab power they do it and it seems that that appetite is
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:24.280]  getting more and more intense why do you think that's happening well the problems are getting
[01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:29.320]  bigger they say that congress isn't doing a job because they're broke but it's the it's the whole
[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:34.840]  system that's broke we're financially broke but those individuals in washington and their mentality
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:39.800]  is different than so many of people outside of washington because they've told me personally
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:45.080]  that they need to take care of people and they need to regulate people's lives because
[01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:49.320]  we can't trust it to themselves because they may hurt themselves or they may not take care of
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:53.400]  themselves and i've asked them i said why is that the case well they are they're too stupid
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:04:00.360]  and inferring we the politicians know what is best i mean that is a mental status of that
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:05.640]  they have and they cling to real and then they don't do like i'm hitler and i'm gonna take over
[01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:11.400]  i'm gonna take away liberty i'm doing the lord's work i care about people you've heard the liberals
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:16.360]  say that they care about people we don't but of course if you really care about people you'll
[01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:20.920]  protect liberty and there'll be more production and more people taking care of them instead of
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:25.240]  special interest taking over control of our government and the wrong people benefiting
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:30.840]  but anyway uh that's the mess that we have it's continuing so every time there's an opportunity
[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:36.440]  they think well if i enhance my power i can do more good not for the world uh although there's
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:42.600]  sinister reasons for us to be going about around the world most of the people are complacent and
[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:48.680]  they just uh go along to get along and they think well we got to go help those people we got to get
[01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:54.280]  rid of absolutely congressman ron paul's our guest i want to expand and you know flesh that

[01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:28.840]  all right i'm coming to you on the road up here in dallas texas visiting family and congressman
[01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:34.920]  ron paul joins us as well from texas via the phone and we have our reporters riding shotgun
[01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:40.840]  with us and the former congressman is just popping in with the news and analysis update here with us
[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:44.760]  today and he's going to talk some about the homeschooling curriculum he's got coming out
[01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:49.560]  in september that is truly a revolutionary idea that i'm fully behind but first officer
[01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:55.880]  seeing the images of lockdown saying it's a prison overriding the bill of rights that is martial law
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:09:01.400]  by definition now they're saying this is the new way in america and we've got to have drones now
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:06.520]  domestically and that basically america's a battlefield we've known this was coming along
[01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:12.040]  with the economic collapse that is centralization uh what can you say about what americans can do
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:16.920]  to reverse this and uh your take on what you saw in boston a former congressman ron paul
[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:23.400]  well i think what boston has told me it's a bigger issue and more difficult to reverse than i might
[01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:30.040]  have hoped i'm always hopeful i always want to be positive i get a lot of people who understand
[01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:35.880]  and should do it but to overcome the power of the department of homeland security i mean
[01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:39.400]  it looks like they're going to have all the guns at least they want to have all the guns
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:43.240]  they're buying up all the ammunition but of course they said they would never use it against
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:48.760]  american citizens what and what are they doing then when you witness what went on in boston
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:53.000]  i mean if this is not martial law i don't know what martial law is going to look like
[01:09:54.040 --> 01:10:00.360]  but the constitution has been trampled and the america people have to stand up any way they know
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:06.280]  how to do it by spreading messages reading study and uh getting involved in politics uh
[01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:11.720]  ultimately though it's education people have to understand why why liberty uh provides the
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:16.360]  answers for us but we have been conditioned probably for 30 or 40 years and you hear it all
[01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:21.640]  the time from the president their job is to make us safe one the liberals say we want you to make
[01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:26.680]  you economically safe and secure and no and nobody falls through the cracks and we're going to take
[01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:31.880]  care of everybody but then others say we want to make you physically safe and governments aren't
[01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:36.680]  supposed to do that governments are supposed to protect our liberties uh once they decide they're
[01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:42.760]  going to make us safe economically and physically safe uh they can only do this by taking away our
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:48.440]  liberties and that's where we are we seek safety rather than liberty and we were warned about it
[01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:53.960]  and i think we need to re-warn the american people and they have to know what the goals are
[01:10:53.960 --> 01:11:01.000]  and to in order to establish their priorities again dr ron paul joins us uh you you talk about
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:05.880]  the bullets you know we broke that story drudge report forced it into the mainstream media
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:09.800]  and they said they're we're not buying bullets and then they said okay we bought a billion now it's
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:14.600]  two billion and then they come out and say it's a hoax that we're buying bullets but we did buy
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:20.520]  bullets so their lies their denials have gotten like schizophrenic where you're reading a headline
[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:27.480]  and they testify this is a hoax but we did buy the bullets and now she said before congress today
[01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:33.480]  big sis that dhs denies ammo purchases aimed at civilians when the targets are of women and
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:38.760]  children on record and the army manual say they're training to take on domestic groups that first
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:43.800]  document we got four years ago said ron paul veterans gun owners libertarians conservatives
[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:50.600]  erin russo uh film owners i mean just bizarre and and and now all that is mainline so what do you
[01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:56.280]  say about the intensified lying or do you disagree or uh are are they not intensifying their lives
[01:11:56.280 --> 01:12:01.880]  well you know they have the major medias on their side so they paint us as paranoid and this is our
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:07.800]  job whether it's uh talk shows like yours or our internet programs or whatever we're doing we have
[01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:13.960]  to reverse this whole idea that uh that we are you know paranoid and just imagining these things
[01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:19.240]  when she when she gives us an inch and says oh yeah we did purchase them they have to pound
[01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:24.040]  her and figure out what are you going to do with them what is the intent how much money
[01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:29.880]  you think congress should have a more of a backbone to stand up and demand this that's their
[01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:35.000]  responsibility but congress goes along with that they they give up the prerogatives to the executive
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:43.400]  branch so easily and uh if if we don't do it see the people eventually have to do it members of
[01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:47.560]  congress go along to get along they've been doing that for years so we only have a dozen or two up
[01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:53.400]  there they're trying but what we need to do is wake up more and more people to howl their congressmen
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:13:01.640]  to say find out why and what are they up to because it's only information that uh that they have
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:05.800]  that can wake the people up if they don't get the information they're going to be too complacent
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:13.240]  and then it'll be too late after boston i i worry more on on where we are but then again
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:17.720]  when i go to the college campuses i get good responses a lot of young people are saying
[01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:21.000]  you know we know what you're talking about and we don't like it and we're going to be stuck
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:26.760]  with a big bill and we don't have a job so there's a receptive ear out there so it's a battle it's
[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:30.920]  a battle for the hearts and minds of people to decide which they think is correct are they going
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:35.400]  to go along with the status quo and you know the federal reserve and the income tax system
[01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:40.360]  and government taking care of us and make us safe and secure or are we going to say it's time we
[01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:44.600]  defended our position that we want our freedoms back and just get the government out of the way
[01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:50.280]  well they as you said earlier government claims that it's here to help us but everywhere government
[01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:55.080]  gets involved it creates dependency in this rec society we've sent our reporters out in austin
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:14:00.840]  but also in california not just in texas and the most people sign petitions to confiscate all the
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:08.200]  guns to not just ban carbon dioxide but dehydrogen monoxide or water and it seems like you've got
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:13.000]  two things happening either people are getting more awake or they're getting even more dumb down
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:18.360]  and they're saying hey we're a democracy a 51 vote to make the other 49 slaves we're going to do it
[01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:23.000]  but in a republic that actually blocks them but the federal government's moving forward like
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:28.600]  it's a democracy they can do whatever they want do you see a collision a clash of civilizations
[01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:35.960]  of informed high IQ productive good people that have it succumb to cultural you know collectivism
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:42.200]  and marxism and globalism versus the zombie hordes i mean this is getting bad is my point yeah
[01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:48.440]  no i i think there will be will be this collision mainly because our our country is is bankrupt
[01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:55.080]  but also uh there's more and more people waking up which i think is is very good and that's
[01:14:55.080 --> 01:15:01.960]  beneficial but uh the one thing though individuals like myself who want to look on the positive side
[01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:10.360]  thing we shouldn't ever get so naive as to think that we're up against a an enemy that's a rather
[01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:17.400]  a soft enemy the worst things get the harder they'll work and the more they'll do to cling to power
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:21.880]  under the pretense of course are always helping people because they hate us they've been powerful
[01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:27.640]  because they've always been to get the moral high ground we're doing good you know we go over
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:33.240]  these countries we want to get rid of bad dictators yes we have deficits but we take care of poor
[01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:39.960]  people all all of that but now they're running out of money and they can't do it and they make
[01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:45.000]  these false promises the only thing left for them since their promises aren't believed anymore
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:49.400]  is they're going to use power and that's why you see the department of homeland security and fbi
[01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:55.240]  uh invoking martial laws in a in a major city i agree so i think it'll get worse i've always said
[01:15:55.240 --> 01:16:01.000]  it's going to get worse before it gets better uh because we haven't even had the big economic
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:06.600]  crisis that i think is coming and then you wonder how complacent the american people will be so the
[01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:11.960]  more people we can alert to being prepared for this so they can handle some of the emergencies
[01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:17.720]  to get by the better off will be so we want everybody to be protected as many as possible
[01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:22.600]  so they don't have to depend on the government but when the government's broke they have very
[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:29.160]  little to promise except our might to try to you know restore order absolutely and so it's a sign
[01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:33.480]  of their weakness that they're trying to flex their muscles and use any excuse to take over and
[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:38.680]  plant the flag of authoritarianism on our once great republic because they understand and they're
[01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:43.400]  scared and they know they've mismanaged things uh now now shifting gears into a subject that so
[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:47.480]  many callers when they heard you were coming on the last few days wanted me to ask you uh just as
[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:53.240]  a layman here and and and working with a golden silver company like minus resources they they're
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:58.440]  having trouble getting the gold it's being bought so quick places are sold out everywhere the mint
[01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:04.200]  can't even make enough uh but they're using paper money to drive down the price while elites
[01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:09.320]  are buying and as fast as they can what do you make of what's happening uh with the war on gold
[01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:14.920]  well i think i think there is and governments always have a war on gold because they want
[01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:20.760]  their paper to last as long as possible they did that how much gold do you think we dumped in the
[01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:25.640]  fifties in the sixties at thirty five dollars an ounce trying to prove that point markets though
[01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:31.480]  eventually uh win out so i think that they very well could be involved in all this dumping of
[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:36.440]  gold that you know that one day when it could be the gold prices went down so much there were 53
[01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:42.760]  thousand contracts sold by one individual i just wonder how close treasure department was uh was
[01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:50.680]  to that but the open market number that best tells you about this disconnect is is the premium on the
[01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:58.200]  coin so uh you and i might hear oh yeah gold prices are crashing and uh well maybe we ought to buy
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:03.560]  some more so we go out evidently there is more than just a couple of us doing that quite a few
[01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:08.040]  went out so the premium goes up which is natural that's the way the market works the price is not
[01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:12.920]  supposed to be going up because the price is so-called fixed by these traders in the paper
[01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:18.200]  market but the premium is part of the price and the price was uh i don't know what the premium
[01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:24.360]  has done in the last day or two but i know when it was when the price of gold was going down rapidly
[01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:29.640]  the premiums went up which meant there was that's like nixon price fixing sure but isn't it like
[01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:34.680]  nixonian price fixing i mean sure he can fix the price but then you can't find you know the
[01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:39.160]  things that they fix the price on when i'm saying ish i'm getting reports everywhere that people the
[01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:44.840]  shops they can't get the gold that there's a major shortage at this lower price so doesn't that right
[01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:49.240]  there prove that the market is saying gold is really worth a lot more and as you said they can't
[01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:55.320]  suppress it forever shifting gears what about bitcoin i've been leary day one because if this
[01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:59.240]  wasn't something globalists were involved in they would have destroyed it now they're not all
[01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:06.360]  powerful but i just have a bad feeling well i don't know uh it's actually what's going on
[01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:12.040]  there i have deep reservations about it because my understanding of money is a little bit different
[01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:17.720]  than uh something uh that comes out of a computer and i don't understand how it's calculated i don't
[01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:24.040]  think anybody else does but if we have a truly free society and people are doing this and they're
[01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:30.600]  not committing fraud and it actually is a it becomes a a means of exchange and people can
[01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:36.680]  transfer and measure things in a bitcoin you know i'm not going to object to that but i i don't think
[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:42.120]  that is the answer i think money has to be something that has been established uh in the
[01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:48.440]  marketplace and there's been a pretty good test on gold and silver like thousands of years so i'm
[01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:54.760]  very reluctant to get involved in even the bitcoin you know it's going to be uh when you make a sale
[01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:59.960]  or a purchase in bitcoin you have to you know do the mathematical changes figure oh how much is
[01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:06.280]  how many dollars am i getting for this but uh i i i hope it's a method where they're challenging
[01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:12.520]  because that's been one of my positions is that we would just have a legal competition with the
[01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:17.960]  federal reserve in place this would be helpful but i'm thinking more along the lines of somebody
[01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:25.000]  who's out there using gold and silver as legal tender as advocated under the constitution uh
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.680]  but you know what happens to people who do that you can go to prison for that you're called a
[01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:34.280]  counterfeiter but uh the federal reserve should be the ones that be held uh responsible for counter
[01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:38.680]  fitting all right i want to get into homeschooling and then let you get out of here but last question
[01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:44.360]  before we get to that i want to bring up boston again because uh the government locked down the
[01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:48.920]  city and then couldn't find the guy and then as soon as they lifted the lockdown which is totally
[01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:54.360]  illegal then a citizen smoking a cigarette out back his house saw the guy was in the boat i mean
[01:20:54.360 --> 01:21:00.040]  this you not only did it not protect us uh you know it's totally unconstitutional but it it's just
[01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:04.840]  all a giant fraud what would you do uh you know down there where you live in south texas on the
[01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:09.400]  coast if they said don't come out of your house today uh or will arrest you and and or what would
[01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:15.000]  you do if you drove up and and you know they had your you know your family with hands up i mean
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:19.160]  this is a big deal they need to get in trouble you have any ideas as a constitutionalist and a
[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:24.760]  pretty smart guy how we could take action uh against this precedent setting garbage that's a
[01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:30.200]  tough one because uh they're the ones who are using violence illegally against the people
[01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:35.480]  and to resist it of course uh that's armed conflict and it's how much how much of a stomach
[01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:41.560]  do you have for the conference confrontation but what we have to do is intellectually argue against
[01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:48.840]  and expose those people who have these lockdowns and and having uh martial law declared because
[01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:54.360]  three people were killed which was tragic but what about every night i think every day there's
[01:21:54.360 --> 01:22:00.120]  about 48 murders every day sometimes on a weekend there'll be 10 in one city they never
[01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:07.960]  locked down the city so uh this um this is a exactly unprecedented very very dangerous and
[01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:13.400]  we have to expose them every chance we get sure i'm i mean that they've had lone gunmen out all
[01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:17.480]  the time you don't lock down a whole city if they said hey please stay in your homes in this block
[01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:21.560]  we think he's in one of your houses that would be you know kind of a probable cause at least you
[01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:27.160]  know something uh reasonable suspicion but i mean just you're all locked in your house and now we're
[01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:31.720]  going to aim guns at you i mean little kids in yards they'd aim guns at them i can't wait to
[01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:36.120]  get you on in september because this is revolutionary idea to get out of the government training camp
[01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:41.320]  spend a few minutes sir and the time we've got left here telling us the best websites to visit
[01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:46.360]  where we should go to find out about this uh hopefully you'll get your your your site back soon
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:52.200]  ronpaul.com but what are the best sites to visit and and why have you launched this homeschooling
[01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:58.120]  initiative of course homeschooling is something i've been very sympathetic with for for many many
[01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:02.040]  years more so every year because i think the public educational system is deteriorating
[01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:09.240]  i've talked about it before but in congress you can't really do a whole lot even 20 30 years ago
[01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:13.320]  i've often thought to myself you know it'd be neat to have a school when i'm out of congress but
[01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:18.840]  i always thought about brick and mortar school but technology has changed and all of a sudden
[01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:25.640]  you know there's a much bigger opportunity to have more students at a much cheaper price have
[01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:32.360]  good education have it you know where it's not very expensive so i've had some help
[01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:40.120]  with this uh tom woods and gary north have been working with me on on this and and they are great
[01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:47.400]  at teaching and we're going to have math math courses in science and history in english and
[01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:54.840]  also you know the first six six grades are going to be free you can go in and get on there uh after
[01:23:54.840 --> 01:24:01.800]  september and get education first six grades for free uh and then the later grades there will be
[01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:06.600]  tuition charges but the one that one other unique thing that we've come up with on this
[01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:11.400]  where it's different there are a lot of homeschooling programs and they're not you know a lot of them
[01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:16.680]  are very decent all about ours will be somewhat unique but there's going to be a lot of interplay
[01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:26.840]  between students and uh and teach self teaching and also um it it it means that uh the cost will
[01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:32.200]  go down because we're not going to have people buying books uh they can if they want but we
[01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:37.400]  want to keep the cost down so if we have a course on the constitution it's going to be done by
[01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:44.920]  reading the constitution and the uh federalist papers and then having a teacher giving a lecture
[01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:49.560]  and then p and the students writing so it would be a little bit different approach we think we
[01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:54.680]  can give everybody a better education at a much better price than anything that's out there right
[01:24:54.680 --> 01:25:00.040]  now and uh again what are the best sites other than canvane for liberty for people to visit right
[01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:05.400]  now to find everything ron paul in particular it's ron paul curriculum dot com and uh there's
[01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:12.280]  there's a preliminary course you can sign up for 25 dollars uh to help you uh get into uh high
[01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:18.440]  you know preparing for high school but that the curriculum really gets started in in september
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:23.480]  but there is a web page now and it gives you some information and it will keep you up to date on
[01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:28.680]  there's a question and answer uh section on there are people calling my wife did it we printed it
[01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:32.840]  off it's it's so it's excellent let me just say this then i'll let you get out here because you've
[01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:37.720]  got to go uh you know when i first talked to you before you went live on air you know we were talking
[01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:41.000]  about you know promoting and how important it is and you were talking about how it's free for people
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:45.960]  through the first six grades and then almost apologizing for selling it listen we have gotten
[01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:51.080]  a liberty movement to fund each other and to vote with our dollars and we'll take the economy back
[01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:55.560]  as you know through markets it's time you know the media attacks us the establishment that lives
[01:25:55.560 --> 01:26:01.160]  off our tax money and corporate welfare that that you sell a book or i sell a film ladies and gentlemen
[01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:06.680]  you either spend your money with websites like drudge report dot com clicking on the sponsors
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:13.240]  ron paul sites my sites you spread the word about us or we're done okay this is war bonds ron paul
[01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:18.680]  you know he lives in a modest house can sail off of the sunset he's at 76 you know years older
[01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:23.480]  whatever it is fighting every day because he has a passion for liberty against the authoritarians
[01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:28.280]  and this is a revolutionary act taking our kids back from the scum so sir i'm going to get behind
[01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:34.440]  your curriculum and i salute you when it comes out uh in september everybody should buy it and give
[01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:40.200]  it to their family members if they won't buy it everybody should support this 110 congressman
[01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:45.400]  wonderful it's good being with you today thank you so much we'll talk to you soon thank you all
[01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:51.000]  right there he goes ladies and gentlemen i mean it's bottom line bottom line i i'm ready to die
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:56.680]  for freedom okay i'm in the globalist face saying i want you going down 110 percent i'll
[01:26:56.680 --> 01:27:01.320]  say a while i liked oblivion so much because that's what it's all about that art type of giving your
[01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:06.280]  life up for liberty and i don't want to die but you know what i love liberty so much i'm not afraid
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:10.840]  of them even though i know how horrible they are i know the things they could do every time i look at
[01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:14.920]  my children and know they could come after them and they threaten my family i just look look at them
[01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:20.280]  and i commit and you know i'm a slob on air half the time i'm burnout ladies and gentlemen i cannot
[01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:26.600]  unplug i dream about this stuff i i can't play outside with my kids or go fishing all i'm thinking
[01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:30.680]  about is news in the new world order and then i do so much research i get on air and can't even
[01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:35.400]  talk about it all because i just know too much i mean it's like the narles barkley song i want to
[01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:40.200]  come back out of break with that uh with our guests because it's you know i'm not crazy because i
[01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:45.240]  didn't know enough it's because i knew too much and i just was talking to ron paul during the break
[01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:49.320]  and he's like and yeah you know we're selling it because you know we have to pay for it and
[01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:55.000]  everything and i'm like i was like man don't apologize that you're selling it i mean the
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:00.440]  globalists have taken over and control the issuance of currency and credit okay we're doing this
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:04.280]  because we love liberty and want to be free and then they create this idea like he said that
[01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:10.200]  they have the moral authority they can sell stuff they can make us give them our money to then use
[01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:15.320]  against us and that's moral and then we oh alex jones you know i've ever had the austin police
[01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:21.640]  chief and he's like oh alex jones alex jones is selling stuff alex jones has got a 50 caliber rifle
[01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:28.280]  yeah and i'll sell my house and a little bit of real estate i've got and all my guns if i ever
[01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:34.840]  have to keep info wars dot com going i will live in a rat infested trailer before i ever stop spending
[01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:39.160]  my money on fighting the new world order but yeah i like nice things i like being comfortable but
[01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:46.360]  that's not my god you see my god is god is liberty and his life and his freedom that's why i take the
[01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:50.920]  money you give us by buying the great products we promote and hire more reporters and get better
[01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:56.280]  equipment and building studios i have a dream to bring these people down i'm a builder i want to
[01:28:56.280 --> 01:28:59.800]  build things i want to construct things i want to build an architecture of freedom i want to
[01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:05.080]  lead the way out of this with you right beside me and in front of me and behind me this is i have
[01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:10.040]  a dream of liberty i have a dream of freedom i have a dream of my children not being slaves
[01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:15.800]  and i am sick of the globalists having the moral high ground while they use our tax money against
[01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:20.440]  this that we're not supposed to sell stuff i don't even i skip this network commercial you know how
[01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:24.600]  much money that costs the network i can't nothing they can do because i just won't be on the network

[01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:18.920]  that place even your emotions haven't let go and so much space
[01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:24.920]  and when you're out there without care yeah i was out of time
[01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:33.400]  but it wasn't because i didn't know enough i knew too much i just knew too hard
[01:33:33.960 --> 01:33:37.400]  does that make me crazy that i predicted everything that would happen with the bombing
[01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:42.200]  crazy the first five minutes after it was announced does that make me crazy
[01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:49.880]  crank this back up for a minute does that make me crazy possibly
[01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:58.760]  man i feel sorry for people that don't know how the world works i just i want the whole universe
[01:33:58.760 --> 01:34:03.560]  to open up to everybody it's it's all right there you can read the philosophy the history books
[01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:08.360]  and you're going to be reading what men and women read and what men and women thought hundreds of
[01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:13.320]  years ago thousands of years ago and you're going to read thoughts you've had independently yourself
[01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:20.280]  and have that kinship through time with people who who discovered beauty loved beauty loved
[01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:26.200]  kenship honor all the things that are good you're not going to find that through this new world order
[01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:31.720]  culture because it cannot give you anything good because if you get something good you're going
[01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:38.520]  to grow and develop like a healthy tree that will bear fruit of a free society they don't want that
[01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:44.280]  they want to be in charge and do bad things and to do that they've got to dumb you down but what
[01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:52.920]  is going to stop them is courage and cbel edmunds was an fbi high security clearance translator
[01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:58.600]  and because she can speak arabic and several other languages and she was listening before
[01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:01.720]  during and after 9 11 and she went to congress told them what she knew and they gagged her
[01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:06.600]  she pretty much broke the gag order incredible courage you've seen the persecution of whistleblowers
[01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:14.440]  the last few years who even exposed crime and they um you know basically threatened her in
[01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:19.640]  things but but she hasn't been thrown in jail ladies and gentlemen it takes a lot of courage
[01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:24.600]  to go up against these people most men i know will not do it they won't even admit this is going on
[01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:29.800]  but uh cbel edmunds did that will give you her website i'm on the road i'm pulling up a story
[01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:34.280]  she really wants us to look at so we'll let her break down here we've got riding shotgun jacari
[01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:38.040]  jackson and david night they'll be hosting the whole next hour and they're going to have syrian
[01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:41.880]  girl on breaking down the fact they're trying to frame them for chemical weapons but i have to say
[01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:48.040]  to uh sebel because i heard her on tv a few days ago we saw her on tv we linked to it from rt
[01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:53.960]  with abby martin excellent piece going over the fact that this could be a false flag could be
[01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:58.840]  i mean knowing what she knows i'm not going to recap at all but we know this the fbi cia was
[01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:04.680]  on these guys for five years it's now confirmed mainstream news in europe in russia that he was
[01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:10.760]  in a cia sponsored the big brazinski program to undermine the caucuses where they're putting al-qaeda
[01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:16.040]  in this is a total setup and this is this is a message to all the patsies out there people
[01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:20.040]  to think you're part of national security stuff you're playing the part of a terrorist to infiltrate
[01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:24.680]  groups you're going to be set up a lot of times uh and and the little brother was just tagging along
[01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:29.480]  he was partying the night before he had no idea they've cut his throat out he climbed out of the
[01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:33.800]  boat and they tried to kill him he's been told you're dead if you don't play ball same thing
[01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:38.120]  happened with mcvey they do the same thing over and over again that's how i'm able to tell you
[01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:42.680]  what's going to happen i had richard belzer on when it was announced and i said there'll be a drill
[01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:47.320]  the people will be handled they'll set up patsies that openly work for intelligence groups
[01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:51.320]  people are like how did you know this jones people are so freaked out right now
[01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:55.080]  they're saying you know that jones must be a government agent or something well if i am a
[01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:59.240]  government agent we need more like me no i'm not i'm a liberty lover who studied what they do it's
[01:36:59.240 --> 01:37:04.680]  so pathological now sebel edmonds has been a total insider and a real government agent that
[01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:08.680]  went public and she has a news website that we're going to put on screen for tv viewers and let her
[01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:15.400]  plug uh here on air but uh see bell i want you to take the floor here that my reporters have a
[01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:20.360]  few questions for you at the next segment and talk about your case briefly to recap it and then
[01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:25.000]  what did you think the minute you saw the boston bombing because i know being a false flag expert
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:30.360]  someone who's covered it for 15 16 years uh actually longer than that but i really been on it since
[01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:36.200]  oklahoma city so i guess 18 years this is like flashbacks for me it's very painful i wish this
[01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:42.040]  wasn't an inside job because that's a lot less scary than you know to have a few lone nuts out
[01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:46.680]  there than to know that the system is this corrupt and then why would they do it see bell thank you
[01:37:46.680 --> 01:37:53.560]  for so much for joining us hi alex good to be with you again and uh as far as my uh case is
[01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:57.880]  concerned i'm not going to get into the civil liberties and the details of my case but i want
[01:37:57.880 --> 01:38:03.320]  to emphasize the fact that since my case broke in 2002 with all the state secrets privilege and
[01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:11.160]  gag orders i have been emphasizing the gifts the reason for the state secrets privilege uh and also
[01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:17.560]  the gag orders being our operation and this is our us the united states government's operations in
[01:38:17.560 --> 01:38:25.240]  central asia and caucuses some direct operations also through proxy nations such as nato member
[01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:32.280]  turkey in this region and that includes all the stands you know kyrgyzstan tajikistan kazakhistan
[01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:40.920]  but also in the caucuses chechnya dagistan and uh so this has been pretty much a consistent uh
[01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:48.440]  theme for the past 10 years with my case and every time i have given an interview or talk about it
[01:38:49.400 --> 01:38:54.840]  people go like oh stand central asia caucuses even people you always bring that up because that's
[01:38:54.840 --> 01:39:00.440]  what you were listening to and this is part of the public program in that red crescent to to
[01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:05.880]  destabilize that this is a public program what is incredible is that it's all public but the public
[01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:12.680]  so ignorant it's like we're speaking martian oh well a lot of it alex you say it's public info
[01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:19.320]  but the mainstream media has really never ever ever covered this and a lot of the pseudo alternatives
[01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:24.760]  that you know about i know about our listeners know about they never touch these regions but
[01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:32.280]  now lo and behold uh with this incident uh in in boston suddenly it put this region the caucuses
[01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:38.200]  chechnya and dagistan on the map you know these people went from freedom fighter rebels overnight
[01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:46.040]  with boston incidents into the hottest terrorist cell hottest al-qaeda terror cell hottest islamic
[01:39:46.040 --> 01:39:50.760]  radical cell parroting each other getting their script from the state department from from the
[01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:57.080]  cia especially the new york crimes and and la times uh washington post but also to a certain
[01:39:57.080 --> 01:40:02.680]  degree a lot of these quasi alternative media and i know a lot of people they got bogged down with
[01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:09.880]  all these ever changing ever conflicted uh contradictory semantics and details the bottom
[01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:13.800]  line is these guys were working for western intelligence the russians blew their cover
[01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:17.800]  for people that don't know you've been saying publicly for 10 years since you broke the gag
[01:40:17.800 --> 01:40:23.720]  order uh with a lot of courage as i said earlier that it was a crime network from central asia
[01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:31.720]  right through the stands right into uh the caucuses right into albania right into southern europe
[01:40:31.720 --> 01:40:36.600]  eastern europe right into so explain the big picture because you were on the inside listening
[01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:41.240]  to all this explain to people what's happening here on the brzezinski grand chessboard and
[01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:47.000]  then how that fits into these brothers sure so as i was saying while people were bogged down with
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:52.440]  all these ever changing information which is in a way it's a matter of distraction people you know
[01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:58.120]  making a lot of uh you know putting out a lot of hypotheses and talking about some details on the
[01:40:58.120 --> 01:41:03.880]  ground we came out as boiling frog's pose and we talked about the bigger picture and that's exactly
[01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:09.720]  what the u.s. government that's what exactly the mainstream media don't want people to look at to
[01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:14.920]  step back and look at the big picture number one the fact that they were from uh this region you
[01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:20.920]  know with connections to chechnya dog aside these are not even nations these are regions within russian
[01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:27.720]  territory and russia and the other thing i talked about of course the the interview referred to was
[01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:32.440]  a good interview with abby martin but was very short so i really couldn't get into it and that's
[01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:38.600]  why we have a much longer interview from five days before that on our website when i get to explain
[01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:44.120]  for example one of the things that keep coming out of the parents for the suspects were that you
[01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:49.560]  know this thing dated back to three to five years ago and while fbi was talking about two years you
[01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:55.160]  know russian is notifying the fbi at the end of 2011 the other inconsistency that is very important
[01:41:55.160 --> 01:42:01.000]  and i'm going to link it to this great game uh in a second had to do with the style that the
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:05.880]  parents were talking about the style of the uh communication relationship of these government
[01:42:05.880 --> 01:42:11.880]  officials with the suspect right away i said first of all that seems to be the recruitment style
[01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:17.080]  you know especially if it dated three to five years ago and considering these guys especially the
[01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:23.880]  older brothers language linguistic skills you know he speaks russian chechen the turkic language
[01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:28.040]  and english he's yeah for people that i know they come to like you know they come to people
[01:42:28.040 --> 01:42:34.360]  and they're like 16 17 18 this is five years ago and say you are powerful you're a leader the cia
[01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:38.600]  needs you to infiltrate these groups so you get these parting animals suddenly you're going to
[01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:43.720]  mosque saying i want to blow everyone up they're they think they're finding radical muslims but
[01:42:43.720 --> 01:42:49.000]  really they're creating the ledger in the history to be set up well i would be careful to characterize
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:54.120]  it as infiltrating because when you're talking about these groups alex and this goes to my case
[01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:58.920]  and this goes to what i've been referring to for the past 11 years all these groups are our groups
[01:42:58.920 --> 01:43:04.120]  we the united states created these groups okay no no no no no no no no i totally agree with you
[01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:08.520]  it's on record the state department runs the islamic terror groups all of them in the stands
[01:43:08.520 --> 01:43:12.680]  you're the expert but but i mean that's all admitted you're misunderstanding i'm saying when
[01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:17.640]  they sent the brothers around to shoot their mouths off at mosque about how they you know
[01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:23.080]  how they hate america and stuff and then they go party at the dorm at night that is clearly
[01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:29.640]  them thinking their agents infiltrating radical groups is what i'm saying when in truth they're
[01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:34.840]  creating their history their ledger to be set up later no i understand and one of the other thing
[01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:40.040]  i need to emphasize right here at this point is initially when the report came out there were
[01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:46.360]  a lot of people who said well these guys only associated with modern you know wealthy churchish
[01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:52.600]  students and businessmen there and we didn't see any signs of radicalization they were hanging out
[01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:57.560]  in bmw's going to nightclubs and now you're referring to this thing of some of these people
[01:43:57.560 --> 01:44:03.160]  coming and saying this is what they said in the mosque that's why i haven't been really covering
[01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:09.960]  all these changing contradictory details because after we can get a lot of people exactly your
[01:44:09.960 --> 01:44:14.760]  right to come and say and okay then i'm gonna shut up let's here's what i'm gonna do then you've
[01:44:14.760 --> 01:44:20.600]  got the floor what is the core of this and what people need to know go ahead well alex this really
[01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:26.520]  makes me feel special you're giving me the floor i'm really honored thank you uh so what i pointed
[01:44:26.520 --> 01:44:33.960]  out the fact that okay these people are exact profile that cia seeks especially in the united
[01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:39.560]  states we don't have many people from caucuses so the older brother is a perfect operative for the
[01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:45.480]  cia to recruit that was the number one thing we put out through our website and say nobody's talking
[01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:51.080]  about the cia connection everybody's putting the focus on fbi and and i believe that the russians
[01:44:51.080 --> 01:44:57.240]  did in fact contact the fbi at the end of 2011 fbi went there they came back and they were told by
[01:44:57.240 --> 01:45:03.960]  the cia to butt out to zip and not to close the case because while i was working at the fbi
[01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:11.000]  with the agents on these operations this was a recurring theme alex we would have a lot of
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:16.520]  investigations we would open up we would uh you know pursue suspects and lo and behold either the
[01:45:16.520 --> 01:45:21.480]  state department and again i have been saying this for 11 years or cia would step in and would
[01:45:21.480 --> 01:45:26.840]  pressure the scs level people the top tier level people in the fbi to shut down the investigations
[01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:32.680]  to close the investigations because whatever we were looking at or whoever we were looking at happened
[01:45:32.680 --> 01:45:40.280]  to be uh our guys from the cia and state department site so and this went to a lot of 9 11 related cases
[01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:47.480]  where uh we had actively just in my own department alone several cases where the cia came and said
[01:45:47.480 --> 01:45:52.920]  you're going to shut this investigations and you're not going to pursue this person or actually cia
[01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:59.480]  facilitated the suspects exit from the country from the united states immediately weeks after 9 11
[01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:06.120]  so that was very similar the other thing that i kept telling people to look at is what is going
[01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:13.480]  to happen immediately after this terror incident the so-called scripted uh terror incident i said
[01:46:13.480 --> 01:46:18.760]  watch three areas very carefully and this is what you're going to be seeing and guess what in the
[01:46:18.760 --> 01:46:24.760]  past two days what we put out a week ago saying this is what's going to take place it's already in
[01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:31.880]  effect it's already taking place number one i said well the biggest obstacle for us to go and
[01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:37.000]  actually directly invade syria because we have the military power we can take it we can take them
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:43.640]  out in two days okay go to syria and get rid of Assad and do this and finish it invade ala libya
[01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:51.720]  you know ala egypt but i said the only obstacle has been russia now with this connection suddenly
[01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:57.720]  we changing had saying well these guys that we created for a while we are going to declare them
[01:46:57.720 --> 01:47:03.640]  the terrorists the hot al-qaeda cell look again we have done this throughout the history with
[01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:10.920]  mujahideens that we created al-qaeda bin laden in afghanistan at some points they were our freedom
[01:47:10.920 --> 01:47:16.840]  fighters they were our guys at some point they were terrorists and sometimes we do it several times
[01:47:16.840 --> 01:47:23.560]  kla okay in the balkans with albanians we deeply we have kla's under terrorist category with the
[01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:28.920]  state department then during the balkan war we made them the freedom fighters our allies we lift
[01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:35.400]  that terrorist title and then after we were finished we were done we put that title back again we do
[01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:43.320]  this a lot with and same thing with mk the mujahideen khad some people refer to them as mko now look at
[01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:48.600]  chechens right suddenly chechens are the terrorists and all these bad guys do you know who's the biggest
[01:47:48.600 --> 01:47:54.680]  lobby for the chechens in several years ago they established a chechen lobby guess who established
[01:47:54.680 --> 01:48:02.680]  it james woosie ex cia director michael ladine frank gaffney richard richard pearl when you look at
[01:48:02.680 --> 01:48:09.400]  the names of these lobbyists that set up this uh the committee for peace in chechnya okay the american
[01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:14.920]  committee for peace in chechnya a lobby group for chechens you're looking at all the infamous cia
[01:48:14.920 --> 01:48:21.480]  di a pentagon and the neocons okay later after it got a little bit of scandalous they changed the
[01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:28.680]  chechnya in the title into caucuses the american committee for peace in caucuses right think this
[01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:33.960]  is not even a nation we're talking about chechnya and now we have this big group lobby group with all
[01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:41.720]  the cia and neocon guys for chechnya and chechens people have to ask this so this is what you know
[01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:47.720]  what happens now i pointed out that there is a possibility that we made a backdoor deal with
[01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:57.240]  the russians okay look step aside and let us go and invade syria directly okay for a while we'll
[01:48:57.240 --> 01:49:04.120]  declare the chechen and these guys in douglas sun as the most radical al-qaeda terrorist overnight
[01:49:04.120 --> 01:49:10.200]  okay we'll set it up we'll script it for you and we'll give you the free hand because russia has been
[01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:16.520]  pretty much wary of really tackling some of these cells within its own regions because if you look
[01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:22.280]  at the map you see that the region is very close right on the border of georgia now recall that
[01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:30.280]  conflict in 2008 the five-day war with georgia and russia so it's a very volatile region plus
[01:49:30.280 --> 01:49:34.760]  russia people are like well russia doesn't need permission from the united states but you have
[01:49:34.760 --> 01:49:39.480]  to look at the geopolitics and you're open for political cover they need the political cover
[01:49:40.120 --> 01:49:45.480]  russia doesn't want that kind of a bad rep in the eu the united states has looked russia is
[01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:50.600]  repressing these minorities they are committing genocide so they have been kind of wary even
[01:49:50.600 --> 01:49:54.440]  though their intelligence have all the stuff uh information on these cells sure we're about to
[01:49:54.440 --> 01:49:58.280]  go to let me just throw this question at you and then we can come back and you can have the floor
[01:49:58.280 --> 01:50:02.680]  continually and and finish up these important points you're making why would then the georgian
[01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:08.200]  government along with the russians release their military the documents that he's at the cia
[01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:14.600]  jamestown funded wolsey controlled zabigny brzezinski controlled meetings uh why would georgia i know
[01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:19.320]  it's moving a little bit away from the west now but why would georgia do that i mean they're obviously
[01:50:19.320 --> 01:50:26.840]  upset about this what does it signify uh because the we produce this video report in an hour in
[01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:33.240]  that interview on this and during this interview uh i counted the issue and i said i'm really asking
[01:50:33.240 --> 01:50:39.800]  for some factions within the russian government intelligence and georgia to put out information
[01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:45.880]  because their intelligence for years for more than two decades have been well all all our
[01:50:45.880 --> 01:50:51.080]  operations well you didn't do that absolutely so stay there so operate great great stay there
[01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:55.880]  she know we gotta go to break it's a hard break we're gonna come back and and recap what you

[01:54:47.800 --> 01:54:53.240]  but again kind of an overall news transmission here you're listening to the elix jones show and i'm
[01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:59.000]  elix jones all right cbel you got cut off by the break there uh you were getting to uh a central
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:04.520]  point that a week or so ago when i've seen the video up on your uh boiling frogs website be sure
[01:55:04.520 --> 01:55:09.960]  and give that full url out uh that you did call for these other intelligence agencies to go public
[01:55:09.960 --> 01:55:14.120]  i was just shocked at georgia and it probably was you because you're well respected worldwide
[01:55:14.760 --> 01:55:19.480]  that georgia would actually go yeah here's the right thing these guys were cia but it's got a
[01:55:19.480 --> 01:55:25.240]  grind on people in intelligence agencies who aren't pure evil like you when you're working at the fbi
[01:55:25.240 --> 01:55:30.200]  to just watch the the you know bin laden working for the cia you're sitting there listening to it
[01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:35.240]  and they're running drugs you know you name it weapons so so this is about a five-minute
[01:55:35.240 --> 01:55:40.600]  segment left continue making this central point you were getting to right so the back deal would
[01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:48.600]  be okay now like with this incident suddenly we have uh chechens and the these fashions within
[01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:55.400]  within the region caucuses going from freedom fighters to hot terrorists al-qaeda link terrorists
[01:55:55.960 --> 01:56:02.280]  and in return for russia to have free hand to go and do a major house cleanup which it has been uh it
[01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:07.880]  hasn't been doing for a while i'm talking about a massive operations and going to the region even
[01:56:07.880 --> 01:56:13.240]  though these people are our people that we planted we do this all the time this is and that's how
[01:56:13.240 --> 01:56:17.640]  diplomacy works you know we'll take our missiles out if you take your missiles out or we'll let
[01:56:17.640 --> 01:56:23.320]  you kill our spies if you let us kill your spies right alex and instead of the international
[01:56:23.320 --> 01:56:28.760]  communities uh vilifying russia they will be clapping and saying look boston thing happened
[01:56:28.760 --> 01:56:33.240]  we already declared them we already portrayed mainstream media running the scripts from the
[01:56:33.240 --> 01:56:38.440]  state department as terrorists so the international community is going to be supporting especially
[01:56:38.440 --> 01:56:46.760]  the united states and e u russia's coming uh crackdown right so and i said and and as part of that
[01:56:46.760 --> 01:56:52.360]  we are going to go and invade syria guess what we put this information this analysis out that
[01:56:52.360 --> 01:56:58.600]  interview i encourage people to go and watch that video report at boiling frogs post it's 45 minutes
[01:56:58.600 --> 01:57:05.880]  and this uh we put out about a week ago and it basically aces in every single point and now they're
[01:57:05.880 --> 01:57:14.200]  saying syria has chemical weapons we have syria wmd ala al-qaeda i mean ala iraq okay bam it came
[01:57:14.200 --> 01:57:21.000]  out yesterday all right two you look at the breaking news russia rounded up 140 people of
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:28.120]  caucus radical islamic terrorists that's breaking news currently right now as we speak first page
[01:57:28.120 --> 01:57:35.080]  of russia today's channel so everything that we predicted is basically taking place now you
[01:57:35.080 --> 01:57:40.760]  compare it out to the mainstream media and the alternatives that have gotten bogged down in the
[01:57:40.760 --> 01:57:47.480]  semantics and some details some ridiculous stuff as it happened with 9 11 they basically lose the
[01:57:47.480 --> 01:57:53.160]  entire picture instead of looking at the big picture they are looking at little fragments and i
[01:57:53.160 --> 01:57:59.560]  understand as far as investigative approach goes people can get clues and put together but the
[01:57:59.560 --> 01:58:04.840]  clues they are giving you the mainstream media and government they are not clues this is exactly
[01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:11.480]  as you just talked about contradictory conflicting a lot of them fault ever changing evolving
[01:58:11.480 --> 01:58:17.240]  devolving rather than doing that we have been presenting the bigger picture and the boston
[01:58:17.240 --> 01:58:23.240]  terror incident basically uh facilitated what we are seeing right now and what we're gonna be
[01:58:23.240 --> 01:58:26.200]  see bell we gotta go to break we're gonna come back into a little bit more time with you and i'd

[02:00:38.920 --> 02:00:42.360]  where they've made public statements since then that's why she's so frustrated i can hear it in
[02:00:42.360 --> 02:00:47.000]  her voice it's all laid out it's all admitted the globalist run al-qaeda they created it
[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:51.640]  they're giving them living in syria uh they'll say i ran as al-qaeda even though it's sheites
[02:00:51.640 --> 02:00:58.040]  they just have oh muslims are bad let's blow up syria oh 9 11 uh you know let's blow up iraq it
[02:00:58.040 --> 02:01:02.760]  that's how dumb they think you are and so she'll be with us this little segment about five minutes
[02:01:02.760 --> 02:01:07.080]  into the next but next monday i want to have the crew get clips from the video she talked about her
[02:01:07.080 --> 02:01:13.880]  boiling frogs post where a week before all this came out she laid it out because she was an insider
[02:01:13.880 --> 02:01:20.440]  for years listening to this in the caucuses into the stands and she knows i mean it's all run by
[02:01:20.440 --> 02:01:25.720]  the cia it's all run by the globalist so she'll finish up you've got the floor then the guys will
[02:01:25.720 --> 02:01:29.800]  take you out to break an interview in the next segment and then they've got syrian girl on to
[02:01:29.800 --> 02:01:38.520]  expose it from another perspective uh but uh this is just really incredible well go ahead and finish
[02:01:38.520 --> 02:01:44.840]  up yeah yes so as i was saying with this now we are going to see a big-time international
[02:01:44.840 --> 02:01:52.920]  plot for russia starting this crackdown uh operations with the uh with the factions in
[02:01:52.920 --> 02:02:00.520]  uh chechnya and in dagestan region and again we need to also watch georgia very very closely
[02:02:00.520 --> 02:02:08.200]  with this because about a week before 10 days before boston uh terrorist event russia sent the
[02:02:08.200 --> 02:02:16.120]  united states a very strong uh also simultaneously cryptic message saying we really don't like what
[02:02:16.120 --> 02:02:21.480]  you have been doing with georgia and that is georgia is in line to become a nato member
[02:02:21.480 --> 02:02:28.840]  and we had this joint um exercise military exercise with georgia right there on the border
[02:02:28.840 --> 02:02:33.640]  and again if you go to the map and you look at georgia's borders what you're going to see is
[02:02:33.640 --> 02:02:40.600]  you're going to see dagestan and chechnya exactly the region that suddenly became the hot region
[02:02:40.600 --> 02:02:47.080]  after the incident so that's extremely important too as far as iran uh goes i haven't put that
[02:02:47.080 --> 02:02:52.920]  analysis out it's going to come out on monday uh i believe as part of this back deal with russia
[02:02:52.920 --> 02:02:58.040]  we are going to put this whole iran situation on hold we're going to hear a lot of more of these
[02:02:58.040 --> 02:03:04.600]  talks with the united nation and nothing is going to happen on iran at least i would say for a year
[02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:09.960]  or or longer however in the next couple of weeks you're going to see the finished up with syria
[02:03:09.960 --> 02:03:18.280]  and you're going to see further internal um domestic crackdown from russia towards the factions in
[02:03:18.280 --> 02:03:24.600]  dagestan and chechnya and one other thing i want to talk about i haven't talked about it before
[02:03:24.600 --> 02:03:30.600]  but for the past several years what i have been getting both from my sources in turkey but also
[02:03:30.600 --> 02:03:37.160]  some intelligent sources here has been the fact that zawahiri iman zawahiri has also been in this
[02:03:37.160 --> 02:03:42.920]  region he's not in pakistan he hasn't been residing in pakistan and here's one prediction i'm gonna
[02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:49.400]  make uh hypothesis i'm not calling the theory at this point the hypothesis i'm gonna put forward
[02:03:49.400 --> 02:03:57.240]  here is uh we will be hearing about uh zawahiri and pursuit of zawahiri in the region which again
[02:03:57.240 --> 02:04:02.600]  as they laid a ground with the boston incident they made it the hot terror cell and we're gonna
[02:04:02.600 --> 02:04:09.160]  be here in u.s pursuing zawahiri in the region and i'm saying it today on april 26 here on your
[02:04:09.160 --> 02:04:15.080]  show uh during your show alex all right thank you miss edmonds i'm jacari jackson and david night

[02:04:25.320 --> 02:04:29.640]  in c bell because uh you know we were talking about some details at the beginning of this
[02:04:29.640 --> 02:04:34.600]  and we sometimes we look at the really close tiny details like colors of backpacks and the
[02:04:34.600 --> 02:04:39.960]  feasibility of the government story and and that when we do that we kind of try to get people to
[02:04:39.960 --> 02:04:45.320]  look at this and examine the official story but what you've done is you've given us a larger context
[02:04:45.320 --> 02:04:48.760]  you know we were looking at the official story the whether there's bombing drills that sort of
[02:04:48.760 --> 02:04:52.840]  thing you bring it out to the larger picture and that's okay we'll be right back after this break

[02:09:10.840 --> 02:09:17.240]  okay putting together with the bigger picture and then following the events as they unfold
[02:09:17.240 --> 02:09:24.680]  after the incident very very very similar to nine eleven and and and to do that you know with
[02:09:25.880 --> 02:09:32.920]  with a logical cool-headed way and of course as with all terror events you have for the government
[02:09:32.920 --> 02:09:39.240]  for the powers really positive externalities and what have been you know have been the positive
[02:09:39.240 --> 02:09:46.840]  externalities here with the incident and number one the government and the powers successfully
[02:09:46.840 --> 02:09:55.640]  had a test run test run for their martial law climate and they took boston and they implemented
[02:09:55.640 --> 02:10:04.600]  it in a pretty large scale i would say considering we were talking about just one teenager 19-year-old
[02:10:04.600 --> 02:10:10.440]  underrun he has never had paramilitary or military training and now we're hearing that he was not
[02:10:10.440 --> 02:10:18.360]  really armed and we stormed houses we shut down stores so unfortunately this was a very successful
[02:10:18.360 --> 02:10:24.920]  drill this was the real drill for the government and for the powers for the police estate and very
[02:10:24.920 --> 02:10:32.040]  unfortunate because of the reaction we saw not only during the event but also afterwards from
[02:10:32.040 --> 02:10:42.520]  people in boston i i am i am really uh troubled by the fact that the test result shows that our
[02:10:42.520 --> 02:10:48.520]  nation is ready to be graduated in the you know the graduation level of police state i don't think
[02:10:48.520 --> 02:10:53.560]  you can get really any further than that absolutely you know i think this is david night how you
[02:10:53.560 --> 02:10:58.920]  don't see bell i think that is uh i think it's real important to look at like you said the
[02:10:58.920 --> 02:11:04.600]  details to see if this is a contrived narrative but as you just pointed out they have a domestic
[02:11:04.600 --> 02:11:10.920]  agenda that they're after that is a military martial law type of police state we saw that very
[02:11:10.920 --> 02:11:16.440]  clearly and we call that from the very beginning you're bringing in a larger international agenda
[02:11:16.440 --> 02:11:21.640]  which we see also with the war in syria that sort of thing and you provided us information
[02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:26.360]  about what you think might be possible motivations you know we had a lot of information leaked by the
[02:11:26.360 --> 02:11:32.200]  russian government that the fbi and the cia were not giving us and so uh you know kind of you talked
[02:11:32.200 --> 02:11:37.320]  about that motivation a lot of people didn't catch a lot of lot of stations don't cover the earlier
[02:11:37.320 --> 02:11:42.360]  hours so could you recap that very briefly and just give us a quick recap of what you see is
[02:11:42.360 --> 02:11:50.120]  russia's motivation in this in the broader context of the syrian war coming up because uh the three
[02:11:50.120 --> 02:11:57.800]  main objectives here have been number one the russia has been consistently for the past over a year
[02:11:57.800 --> 02:12:04.760]  the biggest obstacle for our invasion of syria okay and to remove that obstacle uh and that is
[02:12:04.760 --> 02:12:12.440]  russia and you're going to see this especially with this uh syria wmd ala iraq uh russia is going
[02:12:12.440 --> 02:12:18.360]  to step aside kind of give us the green light saying fine i'm not going to be an obstacle go
[02:12:18.360 --> 02:12:25.240]  head invade syria for russia russia has been determined to go i mean drastically crackdown
[02:12:25.240 --> 02:12:30.760]  on the factions and these are our people these are united states governments this is the cia and
[02:12:30.760 --> 02:12:38.200]  nato as part of operation gladio that started after the fall of the soviet union that's why
[02:12:38.200 --> 02:12:46.360]  we call it the operation gladio plan b in central asia and caucuses taking uh various factions radicalized
[02:12:46.360 --> 02:12:52.680]  them train them arm them direct them and use them as terrorists against russia we are doing it to a
[02:12:52.680 --> 02:12:59.400]  certain degree in chinese border of zinjiang some people know this area as uyguristan or
[02:12:59.400 --> 02:13:04.920]  turkish span if you look at the uprisings there the radical islamic terror cells again right now
[02:13:04.920 --> 02:13:09.720]  we are not talking about it right now they are freedom fighters right now they are the minorities
[02:13:09.720 --> 02:13:17.160]  that china is repressing but one day maybe based on a deal with china we will have them uh you know
[02:13:17.160 --> 02:13:23.000]  put them on the map as terrorists but currently they are our guys there and so for russia is going
[02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:29.880]  to be applauded this news just broke with russia arresting over 140 radical islamic terrorists
[02:13:30.680 --> 02:13:35.640]  from the region is that adab has done chechnya related factions within russia and we're gonna
[02:13:35.640 --> 02:13:41.960]  hear more we're gonna hear u.s congress applauding it u.s intelligence agencies u.s media is going to
[02:13:41.960 --> 02:13:47.080]  applaud and of course the majority of the americans who are only exposed to the mainstream media
[02:13:47.080 --> 02:13:53.400]  and they are only getting one-sided uh flat uh made up narrative from the mainstream media
[02:13:53.400 --> 02:13:58.120]  absolutely they are going to applaud it as well again another unfortunate reality on the ground
[02:13:58.120 --> 02:14:03.720]  you know when you're talking about that how in one area now the islamic terrorists who future
[02:14:03.720 --> 02:14:08.280]  islamic terrorists are now called freedom fighters just as we've seen before and there's a famous
[02:14:08.280 --> 02:14:12.760]  quote from henry kissinger he said we have no permanent interest permanent allies only permanent
[02:14:12.760 --> 02:14:18.360]  interests and uh quite you know right now what they're interested in is going to war with syria
[02:14:18.360 --> 02:14:23.640]  we saw that uh talked about several years ago and so we need to put that in the broader context
[02:14:23.640 --> 02:14:29.400]  we need to see how they're using these islamic groups as cutouts as motivation and justification
[02:14:29.400 --> 02:14:34.520]  for their permanent interests at one point there are allies and then there are you know
[02:14:34.520 --> 02:14:39.080]  sworn enemies and we see this happening over and over again and then domestically we also
[02:14:39.080 --> 02:14:44.600]  need to turn back to henry kissinger when uh it was just leaked uh with wiki leaks his comment
[02:14:44.600 --> 02:14:49.560]  said that the illegal we do immediately the unconstitutional yeah is more difficult takes a
[02:14:49.560 --> 02:14:54.840]  little bit longer that's what we see happening domestically so we need to look at henry kissinger
[02:14:54.840 --> 02:15:00.040]  for really kind of the backstory of what's going on domestically and internationally you are referring
[02:15:00.040 --> 02:15:06.040]  to the great game and and i think this is a good point to emphasize one fallacy out there that are
[02:15:06.040 --> 02:15:13.240]  that is being emphasized by people like shore you know the cia still cia guy and a lot of uh
[02:15:13.240 --> 02:15:19.560]  quasi alternatives that pose as alternatives uh real alternatives and that is this whole notion
[02:15:19.560 --> 02:15:26.760]  of blowback uh i i really caution people against thinking that way let's say even if 9 11 was a
[02:15:26.760 --> 02:15:32.920]  blowback with it was not okay i'm a big believer of that based on all the facts that we have you
[02:15:32.920 --> 02:15:38.840]  would think okay you know fool the government once u.s. government shame on them and fool them
[02:15:38.840 --> 02:15:45.240]  twice shame on the government you would think that would stop this uh terror creation uh through
[02:15:45.240 --> 02:15:52.280]  using radical islam in central asia caucuses zinjiang area of china we have been continuing this
[02:15:52.280 --> 02:15:58.280]  after 9 11 so this whole notion of blowback i mean you either have to say all these guys including
[02:15:58.280 --> 02:16:04.520]  kissinger and brzezinski and all these neocons and and cia they are so dumb and so naive that they
[02:16:04.520 --> 02:16:09.480]  keep doing the same thing and lo and behold it blows back right on our face and we get terror
[02:16:09.480 --> 02:16:17.080]  events or you have to change this notion of blowback and and i urge people to look at the context to
[02:16:17.080 --> 02:16:22.840]  look at the history to look at the last 35 years look at this recent event and the analysis we have
[02:16:22.840 --> 02:16:28.680]  been putting and then ask yourself does it really look like blowback because this is like the second
[02:16:28.680 --> 02:16:34.280]  tier justification the first year okay you know the people are saying this was a genuine event these
[02:16:34.280 --> 02:16:41.080]  guys were radical guys who caused the boston terror then you have the second year tier imposters
[02:16:41.080 --> 02:16:45.960]  imposters who are coming and they are talking about well it's blowback and they are coming out
[02:16:45.960 --> 02:16:52.760]  already saying you see this is what happens when you uh say you know have some joint partnership for
[02:16:52.760 --> 02:16:59.400]  a while with some groups and whether it's chechnya it comes back and it haunts us well that is as
[02:16:59.400 --> 02:17:05.720]  false as the scenario one the official narrative it is just the support that again is distraction so
[02:17:05.720 --> 02:17:12.760]  i urge people to to to remove themselves again step back look at it and you see that come on
[02:17:12.760 --> 02:17:17.320]  you know how many blowbacks are we gonna have i mean nobody is learning here this is not a blowback
[02:17:17.320 --> 02:17:23.160]  as 9 11 was not a blowback you have to at some point say are the people who want to protect us
[02:17:23.160 --> 02:17:29.720]  are they keystone cops or are they you know kind of sly like a fox i mean you know that there's
[02:17:29.720 --> 02:17:35.560]  you you know they if they're so incredibly incompetent that's one argument but then the
[02:17:35.560 --> 02:17:40.600]  other thing is as you're pointing out and and let's recap for people who are just tuning into this
[02:17:40.600 --> 02:17:47.000]  hour you're saying this because you worked at the fbi and as you told alex there'd be many times
[02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:51.880]  when you would be following somebody in the cia would come in and basically take you off the case
[02:17:51.880 --> 02:17:57.880]  take people the fbi off the case is that correct absolutely i mean not once not twice not three
[02:17:57.880 --> 02:18:05.080]  times we had valuable suspects right after 9 11 and with the state department you know it's like
[02:18:05.080 --> 02:18:12.520]  cia aka state department stepping in stepping in and saying no uh we want to deport these guys send
[02:18:12.520 --> 02:18:18.440]  them back we don't want them to be interrogated certain active investigations by the fbi's counter
[02:18:18.440 --> 02:18:24.520]  terrorism and counterintelligence operations investigations being shut down completely
[02:18:24.520 --> 02:18:31.880]  being shut down her pressure from state department and the cia now officially just for the people's
[02:18:31.880 --> 02:18:37.400]  benefit they cite sensitive diplomatic relations and they as they cited in my case when they
[02:18:37.400 --> 02:18:42.040]  invoke the state secret privilege they said if this woman gets to talk if her case goes through
[02:18:42.040 --> 02:18:48.600]  congress with a hearing or goes through court it will be detrimental for certain sensitive diplomatic
[02:18:48.600 --> 02:18:53.160]  relations united states have of course people right away jump the gun and they're just talking
[02:18:53.160 --> 02:18:59.160]  about saudi arabia or turkey and all along i've been talking about it's not that it is that a
[02:18:59.160 --> 02:19:05.240]  certain fbi investigations counterintelligence not counterterrorism investigation that covered the
[02:19:05.240 --> 02:19:16.440]  period 1996 till 2002 dealt with nato cia operations in russia's caucuses and central asia recruiting
[02:19:16.440 --> 02:19:22.840]  training radicalizing arming making them turning them into terrorists okay to use them against

[02:24:12.040 --> 02:24:17.000]  david night filling in alex's on well not vacation he's just out of the studio for a few days our
[02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:21.400]  guest is c bell admins now miss admins i have a question for you earlier when you're talking
[02:24:21.400 --> 02:24:27.880]  to alex you mentioned that the cia was very interested in the older brother of course
[02:24:27.880 --> 02:24:32.600]  referring to the boston bombing suspects why was he so ideal and what does the cia look for when
[02:24:32.600 --> 02:24:39.960]  they're recruiting sure uh let me give a personal example of how how they recruit and a lot of times
[02:24:39.960 --> 02:24:47.480]  cia recruits under the label state department uh in 1997 why while i was pursuing my degree in
[02:24:47.480 --> 02:24:54.360]  george washington university one of my professors okay uh after class asked me to stay behind and
[02:24:54.360 --> 02:25:00.520]  said look you know with your languages turkish farsi other turkic languages such as other by
[02:25:00.520 --> 02:25:08.520]  johnny and and having multiple passports etc you would be an ideal uh candidate for the state
[02:25:08.520 --> 02:25:14.840]  department and i know they are very interested in having you work for them okay and what it was
[02:25:14.840 --> 02:25:21.880]  that i found out basically it was through state department it was the cia because look you uh you
[02:25:21.880 --> 02:25:27.800]  when you have the linguistic abilities okay you know the religion or no the the target religion
[02:25:27.800 --> 02:25:36.920]  which is islam uh you look the part well that is the perfect cia operatives for that part of the
[02:25:36.920 --> 02:25:43.000]  world whether it's the middle east or central asia and caucuses i mean you get a john doe with blue
[02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:51.080]  eyes and blonde and uh thick american accent and no language come on and you know these people can
[02:25:51.080 --> 02:25:58.040]  be easily identifiable and people around the world they have they know by now that okay through our
[02:25:58.040 --> 02:26:04.680]  embassies with visfi through our ngos which is for central asia caucuses for russia this is why
[02:26:04.680 --> 02:26:12.600]  uh russia shut down all these us angios that's the number one cia grounds for operations and that is
[02:26:12.600 --> 02:26:19.080]  both the terror operations with other operations as well in in this region uh russia and central asia
[02:26:19.080 --> 02:26:23.960]  through angios so russia was very smart with shutting down these angios because these angios
[02:26:23.960 --> 02:26:30.840]  are all cia uh so again people there they know that that's the fact so they watch out so what is
[02:26:30.840 --> 02:26:38.040]  the best way for the cia to have people on the ground to do the work to uh to take care of some
[02:26:38.040 --> 02:26:45.400]  of the operations yet land in you know yet not raise that much suspicions and and you have to also
[02:26:45.400 --> 02:26:51.800]  look at the nationalistic aspects of people within the region too no matter what even if let's say
[02:26:51.800 --> 02:26:57.720]  they hate russia they are wary of the united states they know that okay united states supporting them
[02:26:57.720 --> 02:27:03.400]  or asking them or training them or or or carrying out operations with them it's not for the best
[02:27:03.400 --> 02:27:09.400]  benefit of those factions those minority groups those uh islamic cells within the region it is for
[02:27:09.400 --> 02:27:15.720]  the united states benefits so they tend to trust people who look like themselves you know they have
[02:27:15.720 --> 02:27:21.240]  that they shared a religion with they shared a language with therefore uh they are very active
[02:27:21.240 --> 02:27:27.240]  this is the cia within the university campuses and i believe that's where they recruited the older
[02:27:27.240 --> 02:27:32.200]  brother that's the likely place i'm not putting it as back as i'm putting it as a highly likely
[02:27:32.200 --> 02:27:40.120]  possibility as it occurred in my case and he would be the ideal cia operative candidates there
[02:27:40.120 --> 02:27:46.360]  a conduit to further certain things that will be much easier to do with uh your average jondo
[02:27:46.360 --> 02:27:51.720]  americans and same thing is true with afghanistan with all over middle east we do that a lot and
[02:27:51.720 --> 02:27:56.920]  number one recruiting places are the universities the college campuses here in the united states
[02:27:56.920 --> 02:28:01.560]  absolutely he fits more the profile of that type of person than he does a terrorist uh because of
[02:28:01.560 --> 02:28:06.360]  his uh family relationships and like you said the multiple languages that sort of thing and even
[02:28:06.360 --> 02:28:11.720]  the lifestyle that he's living i mean no it's uh as alex had talked about it very secular lifestyle
[02:28:11.720 --> 02:28:18.120]  now you know russian passport that's extremely important caring russian passport is very very
[02:28:18.120 --> 02:28:25.880]  very important yes absolutely yeah i'm looking at the bio for your book here a classified woman the
[02:28:25.880 --> 02:28:31.240]  c bell edmunds story and one thing really stuck out at me here it says having lived under middle
[02:28:31.240 --> 02:28:36.520]  east dictatorships edmunds knows firsthand what can happen when government is allowed to operate
[02:28:36.520 --> 02:28:41.880]  in secret i think you know so many times we've talked to people who've lived under foreign
[02:28:41.880 --> 02:28:47.480]  dictatorships whether they're coming from uh eastern europe or uh some other place and those
[02:28:47.480 --> 02:28:52.360]  are the people who see the hallmarks of what's happening here and i think that's basically
[02:28:52.360 --> 02:28:57.640]  what gives you the guts to speak out on this that that maybe an american would look at the same
[02:28:57.640 --> 02:29:03.400]  situation that you saw an american would say this could never happen in america this is america
[02:29:03.400 --> 02:29:07.720]  this can't happen here you've lived under it we've seen other people who've come here from
[02:29:07.720 --> 02:29:12.920]  poland from germany from other places and they say we've lived under it too and we see it happening
[02:29:12.920 --> 02:29:19.560]  and being repeated here absolutely i mean you aced it there because um the reason that this
[02:29:19.560 --> 02:29:24.280]  is the reality for the americans number one of course is the mainstream media when you look at
[02:29:24.280 --> 02:29:30.600]  hollywood even when you look at the textbooks the uh history books in the united states universities
[02:29:30.600 --> 02:29:37.000]  high schools it all has this illusion of you know like during the war war two with hollywood
[02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:43.000]  when american soldiers come they hand out Hershey bars you know and then people are throwing flowers

[02:34:24.440 --> 02:34:31.480]  i was trying to prove earlier i want to be an fbi profiler first you need to realize the fbi
[02:34:31.480 --> 02:34:39.240]  does not have a job called profiler the next time you see that on your big box network just
[02:34:39.240 --> 02:34:44.200]  keep that in mind there is no such position and also real quick guys if you can stay right there

[02:34:59.160 --> 02:35:03.720]  now david you have some comments about the ron paul interview yeah and also we have searing girl
[02:35:03.720 --> 02:35:07.000]  in just a few minutes go ahead david that's right you know one of the things i appreciate about
[02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:12.200]  ron paul is he always focuses on the bedrock issues you know he focused on the fed because
[02:35:12.200 --> 02:35:16.760]  it's such a central issue our money and the the soundness of our currency and and it and it has
[02:35:16.760 --> 02:35:23.080]  tentacles into so many other things education is that way as well education is a bedrock issue
[02:35:23.080 --> 02:35:28.200]  education is the future of our children if you can grab them in every tyrant has said this going
[02:35:28.200 --> 02:35:32.120]  all the way back to play to if you can get the kids at an early age they own them for life
[02:35:32.760 --> 02:35:37.800]  don't let them have your kids don't let the government schools take your kids take them back
[02:35:37.800 --> 02:35:43.160]  from people why is education a bedrock issue just look at this lockdown in boston and the reaction
[02:35:43.160 --> 02:35:48.440]  of a lot of people to that children are being conditioned in schools for lockdowns it didn't
[02:35:48.440 --> 02:35:53.560]  happen when i was in school when i went to school they have our lockdown protocol was
[02:35:53.560 --> 02:35:57.480]  we're going to line up against the wall right where the you know the killer would walk by
[02:35:57.480 --> 02:36:01.320]  and just you'll spray the wall and he's going to shoot all of us that's right but if you go back
[02:36:01.320 --> 02:36:05.320]  and you look at the writings of the people who set up our government educational system people
[02:36:05.320 --> 02:36:10.280]  like man and do they were very clear about what their purpose was they were very clear about the
[02:36:10.280 --> 02:36:13.800]  schools and just as we look at some of these things and say wow look at this homeland security is
[02:36:13.800 --> 02:36:18.040]  not working and the fbi is not working and they got all these people at the finish line but
[02:36:18.040 --> 02:36:21.960]  this still happened anyway wow these guys are incompetent we need to give them more power we
[02:36:21.960 --> 02:36:26.520]  need to lose more freedoms and then you look at it and you say maybe that wasn't the design at all
[02:36:26.520 --> 02:36:30.760]  maybe they weren't really trying to stop this and you got to look at the same thing in schools
[02:36:30.760 --> 02:36:35.560]  people say johnny can't read what's the problem with this well this government schools that was
[02:36:35.560 --> 02:36:39.400]  never their first priority that was the way they were sold to the parents the parents wanted that
[02:36:39.400 --> 02:36:45.160]  but that is not their priority their priority is to make the citizens passive it is to make them
[02:36:45.160 --> 02:36:50.040]  dependent on the government it is to make them see the government as god oh yeah and you know
[02:36:50.040 --> 02:36:54.520]  my wife has a master's degree in education i took care of the religion and the politics stuff for my
[02:36:54.520 --> 02:36:59.560]  sons because i didn't want to be a slave of sin or slave of government and that's that's what we're
[02:36:59.560 --> 02:37:05.400]  looking at here you know that the difference is the government looks at education as a way of
[02:37:05.400 --> 02:37:11.800]  filling a bucket you are a passive bucket and they're going to stick information in you we look at
[02:37:11.800 --> 02:37:18.040]  education as lighting a fire we're trying to give our sons our daughters the tools to educate
[02:37:18.040 --> 02:37:23.160]  themselves the interest to pursue something and the freedom to pursue it which you don't have in
[02:37:23.160 --> 02:37:28.680]  school so if you've got kids in school even if you can't work out how to get if you're a single
[02:37:28.680 --> 02:37:32.280]  parent or something you have a difficult time working out how you're going to do homeschooling
[02:37:32.280 --> 02:37:37.560]  because it is very difficult even with a two-parent home still look at this curriculum
[02:37:37.560 --> 02:37:41.560]  because this is something that you can put in wrong all curricula the wrong paul curriculum is
[02:37:41.560 --> 02:37:45.160]  going to be coming out in september this is something where you can fight back against
[02:37:45.160 --> 02:37:49.160]  the indoctrination that they're getting in school it's a lot of indoctrination just like alex
[02:37:49.160 --> 02:37:54.280]  talks about often of your kids go off to school and how many guns do your your parents own are
[02:37:54.280 --> 02:37:59.240]  they on any type of medication i mean how often do you go on vacation and all these other little
[02:37:59.240 --> 02:38:04.200]  things uh just be a snitch and you know do what the state tells you like you said the state is god
[02:38:04.680 --> 02:38:09.080]  so you think there's something yeah i mean they haven't come out and made the kids believe that
[02:38:09.080 --> 02:38:14.520]  yes yet uh we are god i wouldn't be surprised if they do that sometimes soon though anyway
[02:38:14.520 --> 02:38:18.680]  guys let me know we have searing girl up and we'll go to her okay so we have a right now
[02:38:18.680 --> 02:38:23.720]  searing girl popular youtube channel i believe it's the searing girl partisan channel she
[02:38:23.720 --> 02:38:29.000]  joins us now to talk about all things syria can you hear me uh yes i can hear you thank you for
[02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:33.080]  having me oh thank you for being on okay now i want to start with this article right here
[02:38:33.080 --> 02:38:37.320]  and once again jacari jackson david nightfilling in for alex jones while he is on the road
[02:38:37.320 --> 02:38:41.880]  u.s intelligence points to small-scale use of sarin in syria and i want to get your comment on
[02:38:41.880 --> 02:38:47.080]  this syrian girl numerous court questions remain about the origins of the chemical
[02:38:47.080 --> 02:38:53.080]  and what effect it a parent it's apparent use could have on the ongoing syria syria syria civil
[02:38:53.080 --> 02:38:59.400]  war when asked whether the intelligence community's conclusion pushed the situation across barack obama's
[02:38:59.400 --> 02:39:05.000]  red line that could trigger more u.s involvement in the war hegel that is defense secretary chuck
[02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:10.360]  hegel said it was too soon to tell but then we have this other article from politico some lawmakers
[02:39:10.360 --> 02:39:16.760]  told last week about syria and sarin and it has john mccain you know everybody's favorite john mccain
[02:39:16.760 --> 02:39:22.600]  saying that we need to have intervention in syria and also need to arm the rebels so what are your
[02:39:22.600 --> 02:39:29.800]  thoughts about that well you know this banter about chemical weapons has been going on for
[02:39:29.800 --> 02:39:37.800]  over a year now the u.s uh saying that it's got a red line on their use and uh accusations flying
[02:39:37.800 --> 02:39:45.240]  about their use the a high level source actually within the opposition told me that he was approached
[02:39:45.240 --> 02:39:52.360]  by the u.s state department with a cash offer in exchange for uh claiming a hoax chemical
[02:39:52.360 --> 02:39:59.480]  weapons story this was months and months ago and he added that recently uh he saw the victims of
[02:39:59.480 --> 02:40:05.080]  bodies of supposed chemical weapons attacks in syria and that he believed that those fighters
[02:40:05.080 --> 02:40:11.000]  died due to accidental discharge of makeshift chemical weapons that the epise have themselves
[02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:19.320]  created and you know there's been actually examples of the fsa which is the rebels or insurgents which
[02:40:19.320 --> 02:40:27.080]  is a more accurate term for them um have been using makeshift chemical weapons in aleppo
[02:40:27.080 --> 02:40:32.600]  and tunnel four alex thompson covered this and many people many civilians were hospitalized as a
[02:40:32.600 --> 02:40:39.080]  result but it wasn't sarin because uh the symptoms didn't have the telltale signs of that there was
[02:40:39.080 --> 02:40:46.920]  also videos that came out and i think info was covered this as well of rabbits uh being killed
[02:40:46.920 --> 02:40:55.320]  by um the fsa who were mixing chemical weapons so there's some there's some evidence that uh
[02:40:55.320 --> 02:41:01.640]  the fsa themselves are manufacturing their own chemical weapons and using them the reason that
[02:41:01.640 --> 02:41:09.960]  this guy in the opposition um didn't go along with this this uh u.s state department request is he
[02:41:09.960 --> 02:41:15.640]  wasn't convinced of their intentions to really intervene in syria because they have never said
[02:41:15.640 --> 02:41:22.920]  that what they would do if their red line is crossed and so i this is still the case so i would urge
[02:41:22.920 --> 02:41:30.920]  this person to come forward himself but um i think that the u.s agenda potentially they have uh plans
[02:41:30.920 --> 02:41:38.920]  to intervene but perhaps they just want to set a precedent for real chemical weapon use um and the
[02:41:39.480 --> 02:41:44.600]  end agenda being to just further create more destruction because if you let the you know
[02:41:44.600 --> 02:41:51.240]  ram it out of the hat then that's it then you know it increases the likelihood of chemical weapons
[02:41:51.240 --> 02:41:58.920]  really being used we uh serin were you able to hear uh i think we've got an echo going back on
[02:41:58.920 --> 02:42:04.040]  the line there but uh were you able to hear the interview that we had with c bell edmunds earlier
[02:42:05.240 --> 02:42:11.000]  no unfortunately i wasn't able to well she had a very we spoke to her and she had a very interesting
[02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:16.200]  take on both the boston bombing and what's going on in syria kind of tying them together
[02:42:16.200 --> 02:42:21.560]  and in her opinion uh she said that she thought that uh this information that's coming out of
[02:42:21.560 --> 02:42:28.040]  russian intelligence services linking these suspects and the bombing to uh foreign cia involvement
[02:42:28.040 --> 02:42:35.160]  and that sort of thing she believes that uh russia has been the main obstacle to our involvement
[02:42:35.160 --> 02:42:39.800]  there in terms of nations she believes that kind of a backdoor deal has been struck between american
[02:42:39.800 --> 02:42:45.240]  intelligence services and russian intelligence services to essentially uh demonize chechnya
[02:42:45.240 --> 02:42:52.120]  and give russia a free hand to work there while uh giving us a chance to uh move into syria because
[02:42:52.120 --> 02:42:59.720]  russia is no longer opposing us what do you think about that i don't think that uh russia is gonna
[02:42:59.720 --> 02:43:06.120]  make a deal that sells syria out not at this point um i think that there's uh definitely
[02:43:06.120 --> 02:43:13.720]  something going on with the with chechnya um being labeled as the culprit behind the boston
[02:43:13.720 --> 02:43:19.560]  bombings i mean the reason that russia is supporting syria at the moment is because
[02:43:19.560 --> 02:43:24.280]  there's some very radical chechens coming across the border into syria and they just
[02:43:24.280 --> 02:43:32.840]  started their own cartoon so um to radicalize the caucus and the middle east uh threatens russian
[02:43:32.840 --> 02:43:40.200]  sovereignty and uh when i say radicalize i mean create like an islamic extremist ideology in
[02:43:40.200 --> 02:43:46.680]  its fostered like they did with al-qaeda um this is a threat to russia and this is what's happening
[02:43:46.680 --> 02:43:52.840]  in syria so of course russia is going to oppose that's one of the reasons russia is opposing
[02:43:52.840 --> 02:44:02.120]  u.s presence in syria now as for the back word deal i it's possible um the reason she said that was
[02:44:02.120 --> 02:44:07.000]  because now now what you're saying is is that the uh russia is concerned about chechn influence in
[02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:12.120]  syria is one of the reasons that they're standing against uh involvement there what she was saying
[02:44:12.120 --> 02:44:15.240]  and she had predicted this a week ago was that russia would make a major move that they were
[02:44:15.240 --> 02:44:21.480]  being held back because of uh you know public opinion against them coming down too hard on
[02:44:21.480 --> 02:44:27.640]  chechen rebels and here we are in the intervening week as more and more details have come out and
[02:44:27.640 --> 02:44:34.440]  as we've heard this constant drone in the news media about chechen islamists that uh now che that
[02:44:34.440 --> 02:44:41.240]  now russia has been emboldened as uh cbill had predicted and uh just in the last day or so has
[02:44:41.240 --> 02:44:49.960]  arrested 140 uh people associated with chechnya in moscow so uh that's that was kind of tied into
[02:44:49.960 --> 02:44:55.240]  what she was saying uh you know explain the reasons why the russians would be releasing
[02:44:55.240 --> 02:45:01.880]  all this information about cia involvement with the brothers and and them being used as a chechen
[02:45:01.880 --> 02:45:12.120]  rebels you know i think um with the boston bombing the brothers um from the evidence i've seen i i have
[02:45:12.120 --> 02:45:19.320]  doubts that these guys were um islamic extremists at all just just by the way that they dressed or
[02:45:19.320 --> 02:45:25.800]  the way that um their twitter feed was uh this it's really doubtful i and that's very important
[02:45:25.800 --> 02:45:33.800]  siren giril can you elaborate on that why why you have doubts well if you look at um the dress
[02:45:33.800 --> 02:45:43.160]  of the al-qaeda style of terrorism um this might be superficial but they usually have a beard and
[02:45:43.160 --> 02:45:49.320]  no moustache and that's because they follow a very specific sect of islam called salafism or
[02:45:49.320 --> 02:45:56.680]  orhabizen and um this is the case you know if it's not just a beard and no moustache then at least
[02:45:56.680 --> 02:46:03.560]  the beard another of the two brothers had that and um it just seems bizarre because it doesn't fit
[02:46:03.560 --> 02:46:10.840]  the bill of uh of what you know exactly alex has pointed out that they had a very western appearance
[02:46:10.840 --> 02:46:15.960]  and uh uh western attitudes that sort of thing and uh but of course here in america it's very
[02:46:15.960 --> 02:46:20.200]  difficult for us to talk about those kind of nuances and get the american public to understand it
[02:46:20.200 --> 02:46:25.560]  they don't understand the difference between sunni and shiaite for example so it's uh you know we
[02:46:25.560 --> 02:46:32.360]  talk about wahabi uh islam uh they don't understand that distinction either so for the official
[02:46:32.360 --> 02:46:36.840]  government narrative it works very well for them to just point out these guys were islamicists
[02:46:36.840 --> 02:46:44.040]  you know that's that's it period just because of where they come from i suppose yeah for russia
[02:46:44.040 --> 02:46:52.600]  um making a backdoor deal with the us regarding chechnya um i don't see russia selling syria out
[02:46:53.320 --> 02:46:59.240]  just uh the position that they've taken up to this point is very hard to back down from
[02:47:00.120 --> 02:47:07.720]  um it won't if if anything if they sold uh you know anything out it wouldn't be full
[02:47:07.720 --> 02:47:14.360]  blown intervention i still have my doubts that um it would come to that so perhaps this is more
[02:47:14.360 --> 02:47:20.200]  to do with political pressure you know this claim is coming also at a time where the syrian
[02:47:20.200 --> 02:47:26.040]  military has been making sweeping advances in both the mascus and aleppo and it could just
[02:47:26.040 --> 02:47:31.960]  be a sign of desperation you know and in the first place the claims are coming out of israel
[02:47:31.960 --> 02:47:37.880]  and that's not exactly a neutral party when it comes to syria syria and israel have been enemies for
[02:47:37.880 --> 02:47:44.600]  since israel's inception so um and israel starts to gain the most out of the rebel or
[02:47:44.600 --> 02:47:50.920]  insurgent victory in syria as it would drive a wedge between syria and iran um and netanyahu
[02:47:50.920 --> 02:47:56.680]  says so himself so it's no surprise that israel is the one trying to push for intervention by
[02:47:56.680 --> 02:48:02.040]  the us in syria um well it certainly bears close inspection and as we've seen before and we've
[02:48:02.040 --> 02:48:07.480]  pointed out uh just as we see with uh what we believe are domestic uh false flag operations you
[02:48:07.480 --> 02:48:13.960]  know we see uh a drill going on at the same time at the same place with terrorist activity uh with
[02:48:13.960 --> 02:48:18.680]  exactly the same mo and that sort of thing we see the government doing certain things over and over
[02:48:18.680 --> 02:48:25.160]  again and one of the things that we see them do when they want to have a a war is to bring up a kind
[02:48:25.160 --> 02:48:31.080]  of bogus uh charges of weapons of mass destruction right seeing this done uh you know for iraq we
[02:48:31.080 --> 02:48:35.400]  we've seen it done a year ago as you as you mentioned this is a narrative that is being
[02:48:35.400 --> 02:48:41.000]  hyped up yet again in the last day or so uh and we've already kind of covered this ground quite a
[02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:50.600]  bit once before um even in syria absolutely you know and the ironic thing is after the united nations
[02:48:50.600 --> 02:48:57.160]  went through and found no chemical weapon evidence in iraq uh the u.s. attacked anyway and uh then
[02:48:57.160 --> 02:49:04.680]  proceeded to use chemical weapons in white phosphorus over fallujah in iraq so really this
[02:49:04.680 --> 02:49:10.680]  this whole thing is not about chemical weapons it's not about humanitarianism right it's about
[02:49:10.680 --> 02:49:16.040]  finding a way in tell us a little bit about the charges last year and how that boiled down can
[02:49:16.040 --> 02:49:21.880]  you kind of recap that for our audience um the charges last year of chemical weapons yes mm-hmm
[02:49:21.880 --> 02:49:27.240]  yeah the charges the allegations of chemical weapons used last year there has been so many
[02:49:27.240 --> 02:49:35.240]  allegations at the beginning there was um just some threats issued by the u.s. you know in case you
[02:49:35.240 --> 02:49:41.400]  use chemical weapons and um there was one i'm not sure if it was last year it was a few months ago
[02:49:41.400 --> 02:49:49.640]  where there was a few hundred injured civilians in a lepo that had inhaled some kind of gas
[02:49:50.200 --> 02:49:55.640]  some of them had suffocated to death but the gas itself wasn't sarin which is the most likely
[02:49:55.640 --> 02:50:04.600]  weapon that syria would possess um sarin would would be the nerve agent and um it's a lot more
[02:50:04.600 --> 02:50:13.880]  potent and even uh people uh working with the the wounded would be overcome by the its effects
[02:50:13.880 --> 02:50:21.560]  and that's not that's not the symptoms so um i suppose none of the accusations have been able
[02:50:21.560 --> 02:50:28.120]  to stick and i think this is another one of those i mean what evidence do they have uh chock hegel
[02:50:28.760 --> 02:50:33.480]  said that uh you know at the beginning he was saying there isn't enough evidence okay hold on
[02:50:33.480 --> 02:50:37.080]  to that thought searing girl we have to go out to break and we'll come right back with that thought
[02:50:37.080 --> 02:50:42.040]  on chuck hegel i'm jacari jackson they've not feeling in for alex jones who's out on the road
[02:50:42.040 --> 02:50:55.400]  so stay tuned we'll be back with searing girl right after this
[02:50:55.400 --> 02:51:06.760]  hey there my name is frank bates do you know the number one most valuable item in a crisis
[02:51:06.760 --> 02:51:12.840]  some people think the answer is gold others think it's a gun but the correct answer will shock you
[02:51:12.840 --> 02:51:19.560]  i just created a free video at crisis123.com that reveals a surprising item that is more valuable
[02:51:19.560 --> 02:51:26.120]  than gold in a crisis 97 of americans don't have this one critical item in fact they haven't even
[02:51:26.120 --> 02:51:32.040]  given it a thought and the sad truth is that you may not survive without it when a real crisis hits

[02:54:21.720 --> 02:54:28.760]  All right and welcome back to the Alex Jones radio show Jakari Jackson and David Knight filling
[02:54:28.760 --> 02:54:36.120]  in now we have an article on infowars.com US unveils Iraq WMD curveball curveball style
[02:54:36.120 --> 02:54:42.360]  lies versus Syria so we have Syrian girls still on the line and also Syrian girl I want to ask
[02:54:42.360 --> 02:54:48.920]  you we saw an article a couple weeks ago about a young child here in a ak-47 in Syria I'm sure you
[02:54:48.920 --> 02:54:55.480]  saw that video as well the 10 year old boy eight years old yes he was smoking a cigarette and carrying
[02:54:55.480 --> 02:55:04.280]  an ak actually there's been so many examples of children being used as soldiers in this war you
[02:55:04.280 --> 02:55:12.200]  think that the crew of invisible children who made koni 2012 that propaganda to to have some
[02:55:12.200 --> 02:55:16.440]  comments about it but yeah and then I was talking a lot about that a couple weeks ago on the info
[02:55:16.440 --> 02:55:21.240]  voice nightly news and I was like we're all the koni people who were so concerned about those
[02:55:21.240 --> 02:55:25.880]  concerned about a guy who many of the people and you've gone to say has been dead for six plus years
[02:55:25.880 --> 02:55:31.800]  at least been missing but you know we see this child with uh playing with explosives and ak-47s
[02:55:31.800 --> 02:55:39.000]  and nobody cares about that you know it's actually um I've seen examples in the mainstream media where
[02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:46.920]  they uh kind of made it heroic or you know understandable that the rebels were using child
[02:55:46.920 --> 02:55:55.240]  soldiers in in Syria it's repulsive but I did want to make a few last points about the chemical
[02:55:55.240 --> 02:56:02.200]  weapons sure that we were speaking about before um you know one thing is that again the claims are
[02:56:02.200 --> 02:56:08.360]  coming out of Israel in the first place but Syria isn't signatory to the chemical weapons convention
[02:56:08.360 --> 02:56:13.480]  so the media when it's claimed that Syria is breaking international law is it's completely
[02:56:13.480 --> 02:56:18.920]  false and another country that isn't signatory to the chemical weapons convention is Israel
[02:56:18.920 --> 02:56:23.800]  so it's ironic that this information comes out from them but Chuck Hagel you know at first he was
[02:56:23.800 --> 02:56:30.920]  saying that uh he's he wasn't disbelief about it but then he said the direct quote was this the
[02:56:30.920 --> 02:56:38.840]  decision to reach this conclusion was made in the past 24 hours so it's kind of like saying
[02:56:38.840 --> 02:56:43.480]  he decided to make a conclusion so the conclusion wasn't made based on evidence but
[02:56:43.480 --> 02:56:50.280]  but you know political expediency so um finally I did want to say that if the Syrian military were
[02:56:50.280 --> 02:56:56.120]  to use chemical weapons then why would they use it on a small scale as is claimed here right wouldn't
[02:56:56.120 --> 02:57:02.120]  that defeat the purpose of chemical weapons which is to cause mass destruction wouldn't it be simpler
[02:57:02.120 --> 02:57:08.280]  just to to shoot the insurgents rather than then use these small scale chemical weapons so it's
[02:57:08.280 --> 02:57:15.480]  really a bizarre claim and there's no evidence yet whatsoever and even if they're uh coming up with
[02:57:15.480 --> 02:57:20.920]  evidence it's it could just as easily be the FSA who have been using it for which we have evidence of
[02:57:20.920 --> 02:57:27.800]  and uh you know again it's just more excuse to create war is just as it was in Europe exactly
[02:57:27.800 --> 02:57:33.480]  when we see these kind of claims come up we all ought to be skeptical we all ought to demand a
[02:57:33.480 --> 02:57:37.000]  burden of proof that is much higher than we've seen in the past you know you always hear those who
[02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:41.880]  forget history or doom to repeat it that's usually said about a generational ignorance that's about
[02:57:41.880 --> 02:57:46.680]  something that's uh happened a long time ago this is something that we saw happen just 10 years ago
[02:57:46.680 --> 02:57:51.640]  and in this article that jacari references on info wars dot com curveball let me just fill this in
[02:57:51.640 --> 02:57:57.800]  for people who are listening on the radio that's the alias of the iraqi defector who basically
[02:57:57.800 --> 02:58:03.320]  fabricated claims about iraq's weapons of mass destruction and the british independent has an

[03:00:33.240 --> 03:00:37.080]  run through some news articles and searing girl you are welcome to give your take as well but david
[03:00:37.080 --> 03:00:41.640]  night go ahead and finish up what you have also that article that we referenced on info wars dot
[03:00:41.640 --> 03:00:46.840]  com and and just think about this and what just recently happened with libya as i report about
[03:00:46.840 --> 03:00:53.240]  3,300 bombshells that were designed to carry mustard and sarin gas chemicals were destroyed years
[03:00:53.240 --> 03:00:59.560]  ago by momar qaddafi when he was trying to make peace with the west but instead we went in and we
[03:00:59.560 --> 03:01:07.880]  overthrew him right and what remains now though there are still 10 metric tons of mustard gas
[03:01:07.880 --> 03:01:15.160]  and sarin gas stockpiled in barrels located in the libyan desert south of triply and they're
[03:01:15.160 --> 03:01:20.360]  worried now that those weapons are going to show up in the hands of al qaeda so here you have someone
[03:01:20.360 --> 03:01:25.960]  who destroyed weapons of mass destruction but we overturned him anyway and then even though we're
[03:01:25.960 --> 03:01:31.560]  very that that supposedly our greatest concern is weapons of mass destruction and yet somebody who
[03:01:31.560 --> 03:01:37.880]  is cooperating with us on it we went to war against him and then we left those in place to be used by
[03:01:37.880 --> 03:01:43.400]  al qaeda who are our allies and overthrowing the guy who was destroying his weapons of mass
[03:01:43.400 --> 03:01:50.360]  destruction this is the insanity of our foreign policy that's being run by corporations to profit
[03:01:50.360 --> 03:01:54.520]  from this and people just can't i don't know why people can't understand that we're funding these
[03:01:54.520 --> 03:02:01.080]  people yeah i don't know yeah searing girl what are your thoughts yeah i mean they've been funding them
[03:02:01.080 --> 03:02:09.400]  since the 80s you know al qaeda is the biggest tool in the middle east for the us it's become
[03:02:09.400 --> 03:02:16.200]  blatantly obvious i didn't want to make a comment about the first article where the one iraqi spy
[03:02:17.560 --> 03:02:23.960]  led to the 100 000 deaths it's funny because there was a bvc article about that that said
[03:02:23.960 --> 03:02:30.520]  the iraqi who fooled the world but you know what the world wasn't fooled the u.s government wasn't
[03:02:30.520 --> 03:02:35.400]  fooled the the u.k government wasn't fooled they knew very well there wasn't any weapons of mass
[03:02:35.400 --> 03:02:41.960]  destruction in iraq you and told them so so to put all the blame of the war on this one guy and
[03:02:41.960 --> 03:02:48.360]  suppose it false claims oh absolutely ridiculous i think though the point is is that here here is
[03:02:48.360 --> 03:02:53.560]  a guy who is a key source and he's coming out and saying that it was a lie just as we've seen
[03:02:53.560 --> 03:02:58.920]  colin powell admit that it was a lie and people underneath him now you say it was it is blatantly
[03:02:58.920 --> 03:03:04.680]  obvious and it is to everybody that al qaeda is being run by the american cia and yet we had rachel
[03:03:04.680 --> 03:03:11.800]  madow criticizing alex jones on the radio on her uh television show a couple of days ago
[03:03:11.800 --> 03:03:19.560]  one straw man absurd argument after the other and one of them was he thinks that uh uh barack obama
[03:03:19.560 --> 03:03:27.000]  is the global head of al qaeda isn't he isn't that with that movie uh that that tom hanks
[03:03:27.000 --> 03:03:32.680]  movie charlie wilson's war isn't that about how we made al qaeda now and tom hanks is running around
[03:03:32.680 --> 03:03:36.840]  what do you what do you guys need to shoot down these helicopters exactly he took over the position
[03:03:36.840 --> 03:03:43.560]  as global head of al qaeda from george bush his predecessor and uh but she is so buried in partisanship
[03:03:43.560 --> 03:03:48.920]  that she's not going to admit that but of course it's also an effort to uh ridicule and try to take
[03:03:48.920 --> 03:03:55.480]  down alex jones to put this the straw man argument up that uh oh yeah he's running al qaeda yeah it's
[03:03:55.480 --> 03:03:59.400]  blatantly obvious yeah you bring up a good point i want to close with syringer we have about a minute
[03:03:59.400 --> 03:04:04.440]  or so left now syringer we get criticized a lot for the information that we provide are you
[03:04:04.440 --> 03:04:10.120]  criticized as well or you know what type of opposition do you come up against oh i'm called
[03:04:10.120 --> 03:04:17.560]  many things i'm called a russian agent i'm called not really syrian um paying being paid by the asset
[03:04:17.560 --> 03:04:24.760]  government lots of things to try to you know blacken my name and my message um if i did have a bit of
[03:04:25.960 --> 03:04:31.240]  airtime left i would just like to say you know the manufacturing of claims of chemical weapons
[03:04:31.240 --> 03:04:36.120]  is still going and that source that gave me information from inside the opposition they
[03:04:36.120 --> 03:04:41.480]  say that the u.s. state department approached him with false information about chemical weapons to
[03:04:41.480 --> 03:04:47.800]  try to make him the one to come out with it so it's still happening it's like re regurgitation of the
[03:04:47.800 --> 03:04:54.200]  old uh tricks and you know even in all the time we have syringer sorry to cut you off uh but you're
