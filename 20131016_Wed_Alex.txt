[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:32.960]  well officially I am the most concerned I have ever been for this country
[00:32.960 --> 00:40.000]  officially the feelings of dread I've been having the intellectual concerns I've
[00:40.000 --> 00:47.360]  been having that match that the data coming in just went from an eight on
[00:47.360 --> 00:59.080]  the Richter scale to a nine-and-a-half top story at info wars.com linked in red
[00:59.440 --> 01:10.440]  Chase Bank limits cash withdrawals bans international wire transfers and I am
[01:10.440 --> 01:14.080]  going to go in this afternoon like I'm setting up an account with Chase and
[01:14.080 --> 01:18.000]  check into this but this we've called the numbers we've looked into this this is
[01:18.000 --> 01:27.240]  indeed being done bigger than saying you can't pull cash out of the bank over
[01:27.240 --> 01:32.760]  certain limits after the 17th of next month the bigger issue is saying no
[01:32.760 --> 01:40.440]  zero foreign wire transfers you have to understand Chase Manhattan used the
[01:40.440 --> 01:44.280]  biggest shareholder in the private Phillip Reserve it is the main head of
[01:44.280 --> 01:52.080]  the Hydra of the dozen or so mega bank heads there's six big ones its head is
[01:52.080 --> 01:58.560]  bigger than almost all the others combined Goldman Sachs is is almost like
[01:58.560 --> 02:06.200]  the tail and the guts and the brain to a great extent but but the big head is
[02:06.200 --> 02:10.760]  Chase and I'll guarantee you this means nobody else is going to be allowed to
[02:10.760 --> 02:14.400]  do wires because they wouldn't be doing this and losing the business this this
[02:14.400 --> 02:19.800]  signifies curtains and again they know how done the public is they're going to
[02:19.800 --> 02:22.640]  use the fake government shutdown and default all the rest of the stuff that's
[02:22.640 --> 02:28.560]  happened before as the smoke screen to bring us into global crises now it's
[02:28.560 --> 02:32.520]  becoming very clear what they're up to Obama care was never even meant to work
[02:32.520 --> 02:37.640]  badly all of this is meant to scuttle the country it's a hundred percent clear
[02:37.640 --> 02:42.640]  I'm a hundred percent sure now I was already pretty sure and we know they're
[02:42.640 --> 02:47.240]  clowered in pivot strategies and other stratagems other gambits but now it's
[02:47.240 --> 02:51.000]  a hundred percent clear and then let me give you the next big bombshell these
[02:51.000 --> 02:57.680]  are the leaks coming in and contacts Paul Joseph Watson on fire as usual with
[02:57.680 --> 03:03.520]  info wars calm and present planet calm crisis USDA order states to withhold
[03:03.520 --> 03:10.200]  electronic food stamps and I saw this at 6 a.m. this morning and as soon as they
[03:10.200 --> 03:14.720]  opened up on the east coast at 7 a.m. I began to call and they told me there was
[03:14.720 --> 03:19.080]  government shutdown so I couldn't talk to any PR people but I called the numbers
[03:19.080 --> 03:26.520]  involved and indeed this is a real document and this came out October 11th
[03:26.520 --> 03:31.320]  so last week we got it we're breaking it they are going to stop sending food
[03:31.320 --> 03:37.120]  stamps of the digital money of the USDA that's over it on the supplemental
[03:37.120 --> 03:42.640]  nutritional assistance program snap and the country will snap with 49 million
[03:42.640 --> 03:48.280]  people on this baby alone and it also funds through health and human services
[03:48.280 --> 03:51.160]  but it's the group that funds at the school lunch program at least part of it
[03:51.160 --> 03:56.680]  so they call it a snaps lapse in funding now of course that's all standard
[03:56.680 --> 04:01.280]  essential funding but it's just like cities won't fix potholes will let
[04:01.280 --> 04:05.000]  police cars be falling apart and ambulances and fire trucks not working
[04:05.000 --> 04:09.720]  and they'll you raise taxes over and over again and then hold you hostage or
[04:09.720 --> 04:13.160]  raise them again that's what's happening shutting down the monuments the
[04:13.160 --> 04:17.360]  national parts that are even privately funded and at private lodges fact it's
[04:17.360 --> 04:21.480]  in the headline here principle stops pledge of allegiance to remind kids of
[04:21.480 --> 04:26.200]  government shutdown I mean that's all this is that's what's that's what's
[04:26.200 --> 04:32.520]  going on here so we're going to go to break and when we come back we're gonna
[04:32.520 --> 04:35.640]  get into why this is such a big deal I'm gonna try to be calm in fact I am
[04:35.640 --> 04:42.800]  calm this news is so ultra horrible I'm actually calm I mean we are talking
[04:42.800 --> 04:51.600]  about just an insane time ladies and gentlemen to be alive I I would be

[08:09.520 --> 08:27.360]  resistance to tyrants is obedience to God it's Alex Jones welcome my friends
[08:27.360 --> 08:34.000]  welcome and thank you for joining us on this Wednesday the 16th day of October
[08:34.000 --> 08:44.600]  2013 I am officially now more concerned and more not even freaked out because
[08:44.600 --> 08:50.720]  now I'm completely calm and focused because we have absolute confirmation
[08:50.720 --> 08:56.080]  of everything we predicted everything we broke down everything that we surmised
[08:56.080 --> 09:00.240]  by projecting forward analytically historically what was going to happen
[09:00.240 --> 09:06.120]  that our analysis has been absolutely spot-on now we don't deserve laurels or
[09:06.120 --> 09:17.640]  praise here because about 95% or so maybe a little less 90 over 90% of
[09:17.640 --> 09:22.080]  everything they're doing the globalists have written white papers and
[09:22.080 --> 09:25.680]  documents on how they've done it in other countries and how they were going to do
[09:25.680 --> 09:31.240]  it here I mean rank corporations said they would put federal forces over local
[09:31.240 --> 09:35.700]  police then privatize them take everyone's guns break up the family put
[09:35.700 --> 09:38.840]  everybody in forced labor camps I mean that was a plan back in the 80s and 90s
[09:38.840 --> 09:43.760]  we've printed those reports off shown them to you here on air for the national
[09:43.760 --> 09:49.640]  stability the national stability force the national stabilization force I've
[09:49.640 --> 09:54.400]  actually read through over the years thousands of pages in those different
[09:54.400 --> 09:59.000]  reports I mean I've actually sat there in horror with the ran corporation when
[09:59.000 --> 10:04.720]  I first ran into these in 1998 because I saw an article in the Austin America
[10:04.720 --> 10:08.680]  statesman saying that soon we wouldn't have liberties there would be troops on
[10:08.680 --> 10:16.840]  the streets federal paramilitaries private contractors and that terrorism was
[10:16.840 --> 10:21.600]  coming and that it was going to be the pretext to roll this out and the
[10:21.600 --> 10:27.040]  article was so thinly veiled that I went to the University of Texas law
[10:27.040 --> 10:32.800]  library and actually because back then I couldn't find it online actually pulled
[10:32.800 --> 10:36.640]  the ran corporation report and I've been running around like a chicken with my
[10:36.640 --> 10:40.240]  head cut off ever since saying they're gearing up for martial law they'll
[10:40.240 --> 10:44.160]  trigger a collapse with derivatives they'll then take over their funding
[10:44.160 --> 10:47.280]  terrorist groups so they allow to attack us so they can then take our rights
[10:47.280 --> 10:56.840]  and so we've gone through all those permutations and now we're here towards
[10:56.840 --> 11:01.920]  the big D-Day New World Order invasion basically this is their D-Day because they
[11:01.920 --> 11:10.560]  see America and Liberty as the bad guy and it's on or to flip it back and maybe
[11:10.560 --> 11:15.000]  it's operation Barbarossa to use the Hitler analogy of the globalist being
[11:15.000 --> 11:23.480]  Hitler turning east this is economic warfare it is strategically been war
[11:23.480 --> 11:27.480]  game in other nations and they are rolling it out obama care was designed
[11:27.480 --> 11:34.720]  as a torpedo to completely destroy the engine of one-seventh the economy
[11:34.720 --> 11:39.200]  health care and impoverish everyone else with a massive direct tax to offshore
[11:39.200 --> 11:45.200]  banks a massive torpedo attack and do federalized health care and restrict
[11:45.200 --> 11:50.960]  care and lower quality they're shutting down the power grids everywhere they're
[11:50.960 --> 11:54.560]  shutting down the privately owned independently controlled city county
[11:54.560 --> 11:59.160]  state-owned power systems power prices are doubling in many areas there are
[11:59.160 --> 12:02.600]  about a third nationwide the last five years they are actually blowing our
[12:02.600 --> 12:07.760]  energy system I mean this is a this is a military attack they are chemically
[12:07.760 --> 12:09.960]  hitting the public biologically hitting the public
[12:09.960 --> 12:15.800]  radiologically hitting the public they are attacking the family they are
[12:15.800 --> 12:22.560]  breaking down the entire society we are under total war total siege scientific
[12:22.560 --> 12:27.800]  and Cass Sunstein and John P. Holdren and all of them at the White House have
[12:27.800 --> 12:32.680]  all been are been writing white papers since the 70s on their battle plan for
[12:32.680 --> 12:40.440]  us it's all public that's how dumb they think the public is and now it's clear
[12:40.440 --> 12:44.360]  obama care was never meant to even work except for a direct tax to foreign
[12:44.360 --> 12:48.640]  banks they've doubled the premiums they're set to quadruple them in the
[12:48.640 --> 12:51.320]  next three years it'll never even get to that they're gonna implode everything
[12:51.320 --> 12:55.840]  long before it's just set to no matter what it takes they will send us into
[12:55.840 --> 13:01.640]  depression while posing as saviors giving select government money and
[13:01.640 --> 13:06.320]  contracts to insiders and to their friends just like when a third world
[13:06.320 --> 13:10.880]  country takes an IMF or World Bank loan say for five billion dollars it is in
[13:10.880 --> 13:16.160]  the document on record that that Western taxpayer money so they're impoverishing
[13:16.160 --> 13:20.120]  you while they transfer the wealth is given to select globalist corporations
[13:20.120 --> 13:25.360]  who then make sure no benefit goes to the outside population and who will
[13:25.360 --> 13:30.400]  even demand to get this five billion Brazil in one case you've got to shut
[13:30.400 --> 13:34.080]  off your city run water system and turn it over to us you've got to turn off
[13:34.080 --> 13:39.160]  these five power plants in your capital city and you've got to take it from the
[13:39.160 --> 13:43.480]  new plants we've got coming online and then once they do that the politicians
[13:43.480 --> 13:46.880]  get the money they run with part of it they're paid off they move to Switzerland
[13:46.880 --> 13:51.520]  directly president of Mexico Salinas it doesn't matter it's the same pattern
[13:51.520 --> 13:56.800]  they moved to Luxembourg or London they take us just a maybe a hundred million
[13:56.800 --> 14:00.600]  of the five billion in one case and then they leave they shut down the country
[14:00.600 --> 14:05.280]  they double triple the water prices they double triple the power prices and then
[14:05.280 --> 14:08.560]  they shut everything down until everything is bankrupted then they come
[14:08.560 --> 14:14.480]  in and phase two by everything up and they do it over and over again then
[14:14.480 --> 14:18.880]  they'll use a drug war when a country like Mexico is 50 years into this tour
[14:18.880 --> 14:22.800]  that's only economy they've got they'll come in and then wage war against all
[14:22.800 --> 14:29.120]  the cartels they don't fully control who were just paying them a kickback a a
[14:29.120 --> 14:34.440]  ransom what was the term the Romans use when the when the when the when their
[14:34.440 --> 14:39.440]  vassal states tribute they pay tribute to Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Chase Bank of
[14:39.440 --> 14:44.480]  America Wells Fargo on record hundreds of billion per bank per year on record
[14:44.480 --> 14:48.680]  they pay the tribute and then that wasn't even enough they said run full
[14:48.680 --> 14:52.080]  extermination operation so they could still expose this eight years ago on
[14:52.080 --> 14:55.560]  the show they put him in jail for it DEA agent with a whistle he said they're
[14:55.560 --> 14:59.600]  training CIA paramilitaries to train Los Zetas no one even heard that name then
[14:59.600 --> 15:05.840]  here now they're gonna launch a civil war in Mexico to destabilize the country
[15:05.840 --> 15:09.840]  just like you fund both sides in Libya and Syria this and the globalists are
[15:09.840 --> 15:13.280]  doing that here man against woman old against young black against white why
[15:13.280 --> 15:16.040]  do you think Rachel Maddow gets up there every night with Al Sharpton and says
[15:16.040 --> 15:22.080]  every one at that World War two March was a racist with no evidence it's so
[15:22.080 --> 15:25.360]  that blacks Hispanics Asians and others don't feel like they have a right to
[15:25.360 --> 15:31.160]  liberty and so they then associate Bill of Rights Constitution due process with
[15:31.160 --> 15:38.960]  racism it is psych warfare 101 now I'm looking at the news here ladies and
[15:38.960 --> 15:44.120]  gentlemen try to remain calm I already knew this was going on already told my
[15:44.120 --> 15:50.080]  wife I already told the crew weeks ago on record I went and I said we've got to
[15:50.080 --> 15:54.680]  make preparations now to basically in the future under collapse if it goes this
[15:54.680 --> 15:58.880]  far and it may go this far holding us ransom the globalist to have arm guards
[15:58.880 --> 16:08.320]  here basically and just guard money to even pay our crew and and prepare for
[16:08.320 --> 16:14.280]  real collapse folks by design blaming the shutdown see we're bankrupt if they
[16:14.280 --> 16:17.880]  keep raising the debt limit anyways already losing our credit rating last
[16:17.880 --> 16:23.400]  year when they raised the debt but if they don't hold the ransom and then do
[16:23.400 --> 16:28.960]  the debt ceiling then it destroys confidence because the rating agencies
[16:28.960 --> 16:32.360]  run by the big banks that have maneuvered us there they're now over our
[16:32.360 --> 16:35.720]  country ratings agencies not even foreign countries this is how we've been
[16:35.720 --> 16:38.720]  maneuvered into this they lower our credit rating which is what they want
[16:38.720 --> 16:44.440]  anyways get us into a 17 trillion dollar debt shine us on to unfunded mandates
[16:44.440 --> 16:49.120]  of 70 trillion that's top economists on average say about 70 trillion that's our
[16:49.120 --> 16:54.440]  real debt 70 trillion the debt they signed us on to 644 trillion derivatives
[16:54.440 --> 16:58.720]  USA Today reported not concur with their analysis our experts do other
[16:58.720 --> 17:03.680]  economists 644 trillion that was four or five years ago more like 80 I mean
[17:03.680 --> 17:08.280]  800 trillion now that they say is our debt that's not ours we could get out of
[17:08.280 --> 17:13.360]  the 70 trillion it's going to be hard we could we could deal with it they want to
[17:13.360 --> 17:17.480]  have it so far gone folks it's over unless we just renounce all the debt
[17:17.480 --> 17:21.200]  that will still implode things so they've got us maneuvered with the
[17:21.200 --> 17:23.920]  communist Chinese the private Federal Reserve owning the most debt than the
[17:23.920 --> 17:29.360]  communist Chinese then the Saudi Arabians then the Bank of England the Bank of
[17:29.360 --> 17:34.200]  Germany Boondis they've got us totally maneuvered into this situation and
[17:34.200 --> 17:39.560]  they're now telling us everything's going to collapse because the Tea Party
[17:39.560 --> 17:43.760]  didn't want to bankrupt the country and go above 17 trillion and wanted to
[17:43.760 --> 17:47.520]  finally cut some stuff and the Tea Party Republicans the small core there
[17:47.520 --> 17:51.360]  they're corrupt in establishment but they get this will destroy the whole
[17:51.360 --> 17:54.640]  country and they don't want to do that that's one school that just wants to

[24:19.200 --> 24:24.080]  they create the crises or exacerbated and they certainly don't let a good
[24:24.080 --> 24:29.520]  crisis go to waste they use it as a power grab and their evil is only
[24:29.520 --> 24:34.880]  surpassed by their arrogance like the head of the National Park Service coming
[24:34.880 --> 24:40.200]  out in the press release and a speech a press conference defending the shot down
[24:40.200 --> 24:45.240]  of the parks when they have most of their personnel still on duty 80 plus
[24:45.240 --> 24:51.360]  percent harassing people and going and shutting down parks that they're not
[24:51.360 --> 24:56.640]  even normally at opens commons areas because they want you to feel the pain
[24:56.640 --> 25:01.240]  it's all about running your life making themselves the center of the universe so
[25:01.240 --> 25:05.000]  the crisis is real because they're orchestrating it and have maneuvered us
[25:05.000 --> 25:09.840]  into it people get confused they go well wait you say the debt limits no big
[25:09.840 --> 25:14.360]  deal but it is a big deal listen to me carefully because I see the Democrats
[25:14.360 --> 25:18.880]  commenting on info wars.com going you wanted this right winger now what's
[25:18.880 --> 25:23.720]  happening now you'll learn this will wreck health care then we'll get pure
[25:23.720 --> 25:28.240]  socialism you won't get anything idiot unless you're gonna be working in a
[25:28.240 --> 25:32.520]  slave camp at Foxcom jumping into suicide nets with Al Gore laughing about
[25:32.520 --> 25:38.000]  his billion-dollar paycheck morons you're not liberals you're authoritarian
[25:38.000 --> 25:41.680]  followers you're not even authoritarians you're useful idiots for
[25:41.680 --> 25:45.400]  authoritarians you'll find out though it doesn't matter you'll get what you want
[25:45.400 --> 25:52.600]  don't worry the point is is that they had the debt limit earlier for months and
[25:52.600 --> 25:57.560]  months remember just a little while ago and all they did was it was this year
[25:57.560 --> 26:01.040]  was a few months ago for was it three months they froze the debt limit and
[26:01.040 --> 26:07.840]  said oh we haven't gone above sixteen point three trillion we haven't gone
[26:07.840 --> 26:16.160]  above sixteen point three trillion they just did an accounting manipulation and
[26:16.160 --> 26:19.360]  then it finally got passed so they said okay no big deal but see now they're
[26:19.360 --> 26:22.760]  ready with the martial law drills the government shutdown drills and
[26:22.760 --> 26:25.800]  everything in place now they're ready because there was a government shutdown
[26:25.800 --> 26:30.400]  to blame it on that and to hold it up and they have Moody's and standard and
[26:30.400 --> 26:34.000]  pours and all the rating agencies saying America's about to lose its rating
[26:34.000 --> 26:38.160]  and about to collapse and will be no more there'll be a new global order run
[26:38.160 --> 26:41.920]  by the IMF and World Bank with SDRs and the end of the dollar and even if this
[26:41.920 --> 26:46.240]  doesn't happen this time they're introducing the idea here it is
[26:46.240 --> 26:50.200]  Washington hits the sixteen point seven trillion debt ceiling with three
[26:50.200 --> 26:54.200]  hundred billion in new debt tomorrow officially it will be breached because
[26:54.200 --> 26:57.840]  they're not gonna just say oh it didn't go up remember Obama waved a magic wand
[26:57.840 --> 27:00.520]  for three months okay you won't pass the debt ceiling you want to have the
[27:00.520 --> 27:06.120]  crisis now nope our debt hasn't gone up we'll use accounting gimmicks now
[27:06.120 --> 27:11.000]  they're not doing that so see it's kind of like if somebody runs you over on
[27:11.000 --> 27:17.520]  purpose you are being run over but it's on purpose kind of like normally if
[27:17.520 --> 27:20.520]  somebody didn't want to jump the sidewalk and run you over on purpose
[27:20.520 --> 27:24.720]  car driving by you on the road wouldn't be a danger the debt limit wouldn't be a
[27:24.720 --> 27:29.560]  big issue long term it is because we're overall it brings us to being insolvent
[27:29.560 --> 27:35.640]  back it's not too far down the road a few years now max but if someone jumps the
[27:35.640 --> 27:41.640]  curb and runs over you see now it's artificial but it's a real problem
[27:41.640 --> 27:46.560]  that's what I need to get through to the Democratic Party people and again I'm
[27:46.560 --> 27:50.000]  not defending the Republicans when they were in love and you know with Bush they
[27:50.000 --> 27:56.680]  wouldn't even have lovers tryst with him or Spats they love torture they love
[27:56.680 --> 28:00.560]  secret police they love being spied on because it was to fight the Muslims and
[28:00.560 --> 28:05.480]  the al-Qaeda and I was like the globalist run al-Qaeda you people are idiots this
[28:05.480 --> 28:08.560]  is all gonna be used on you look at the internal training manuals just for the
[28:08.560 --> 28:14.480]  American people now they know I mean I guarantee if Bush had a third term or
[28:14.480 --> 28:20.120]  some Republican had gotten elected if John McCain would have been elected I
[28:20.120 --> 28:24.400]  mean the Democrats would be freaking out if they were arresting members of the
[28:24.400 --> 28:30.080]  press torturing torture ships all this but though oh it's okay because he's
[28:30.080 --> 28:38.080]  black and then that's all it's clearly more white than he is black I mean it's
[28:38.080 --> 28:44.000]  just it's just totally sick folks how it all becomes a giant distraction and then
[28:44.000 --> 28:47.600]  they use it for racial division and all the rest of it and they are maneuvering
[28:47.600 --> 28:50.320]  us and the Republicans come and say okay we'll give you all of Obamacare
[28:50.320 --> 28:55.560]  everything else you want and Obama says I don't want that it's your fault we're
[28:55.560 --> 28:59.280]  gonna lose our credit rating and then meanwhile they have all the establishment
[28:59.280 --> 29:02.480]  banks who didn't threaten to lower our credit rating for three months when it
[29:02.480 --> 29:06.640]  really went above the debt limit no now on cue that worked for Goldman Sachs
[29:06.640 --> 29:15.240]  JP Morgan Chase the whole nine yards look at this look at the articles right
[29:15.240 --> 29:21.000]  here they now have them threatening to destroy our credit rating look at these
[29:21.000 --> 29:25.560]  headlines the Sun is setting on the dollar supremacy and with it American
[29:25.560 --> 29:33.320]  power all on purpose Fitch puts US credit rating under review for downgrade
[29:33.320 --> 29:41.320]  RT that's some of what we've got they are maneuvering us by design and you could
[29:41.320 --> 29:44.720]  give Obama anything he wants he wouldn't go with it because the plan is to
[29:44.720 --> 29:50.120]  destroy America and break our back to then collectivize us we're on the

[33:54.040 --> 33:58.240]  it was taken over almost every country in the world
[33:58.240 --> 34:03.240]  that is establishing hegemonic planetary private corporate rule
[34:03.240 --> 34:06.560]  by what that's a quote from devos two years ago
[34:06.560 --> 34:11.040]  that are demanding one hundred trillion per decade in taxes
[34:11.040 --> 34:12.880]  from the nation states
[34:12.880 --> 34:16.000]  so you pay four or five levels of government taxes
[34:16.000 --> 34:18.880]  now there's going to be a global government tax
[34:18.880 --> 34:22.360]  it's always been there with the IMF and World Bank but it was small compared to
[34:22.360 --> 34:23.440]  the aggregate
[34:23.440 --> 34:24.920]  now
[34:24.920 --> 34:26.800]  it's going to be the majority
[34:26.800 --> 34:29.400]  and it's going to be digitally on everything
[34:29.400 --> 34:31.200]  tracking and tracing what you do
[34:31.200 --> 34:33.120]  and then gaming the economy
[34:33.120 --> 34:37.080]  for poverty and social control that's called agenda twenty one
[34:37.080 --> 34:39.240]  this is scientific tyranny
[34:39.240 --> 34:40.600]  all the way to describe it
[34:40.600 --> 34:43.080]  a scientific dictatorship
[34:43.080 --> 34:45.720]  whose main programming
[34:45.720 --> 34:47.600]  whose prime directive is
[34:47.600 --> 34:49.120]  exterminate
[34:49.120 --> 34:52.760]  set up world government cut off resources dumbed down populations
[34:52.760 --> 34:54.440]  poisoned food supply
[34:54.440 --> 34:55.960]  reduced population
[34:55.960 --> 34:59.560]  and many will say there are too many people they're dumbed down needs to happen
[34:59.560 --> 35:02.680]  even if you agree with that you need to understand
[35:02.680 --> 35:05.800]  we've done the math and roth cop said only six thousand people are a member of
[35:05.800 --> 35:09.120]  the inner elite i agree with that analysis the head of the kitchens agree
[35:09.120 --> 35:13.840]  we did the math on that it was point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero was
[35:13.840 --> 35:16.680]  six zeros and i think four two
[35:16.680 --> 35:19.400]  i go from memory so it's it's not the one percent
[35:19.400 --> 35:22.820]  it's not the it's not that ninety nine point nine nine nine nine nine nine nine
[35:22.820 --> 35:26.920]  nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine
[35:26.920 --> 35:31.860]  nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine ninety nine nine
[35:31.860 --> 35:35.680]  five all on and on and on the facts
[35:35.680 --> 35:38.040]  he had a matter of two whole bunch of Badges
[35:38.040 --> 35:42.120]  before you talk about how many of their are furs先
[35:42.120 --> 35:44.040]  the elite are worried about the top
[35:44.040 --> 35:46.160]  ten percent that are middle class
[35:46.160 --> 35:49.680]  they got to get rid of because they might be a little lepid and have some savings. They might
[35:49.680 --> 35:53.280]  politically get involved, take government back. That's what the armored vehicles and
[35:53.280 --> 35:58.320]  homeland security's for. And there won't be many of those left soon. Don't worry. All of you that
[35:58.320 --> 36:03.120]  want everybody to be poor and miserable, you're very close to your dream. You're gonna, it's,
[36:03.120 --> 36:11.840]  you like company? You are so close to all the prosperity that's left gone. So just keep waiting,
[36:11.840 --> 36:16.560]  keep that hand out to Obama. Because as soon as they've bankrupted the whole country and rolled
[36:16.560 --> 36:22.000]  it over, they're going to turn everything off, okay? Get ready. The armored vehicles, the troops
[36:22.000 --> 36:25.360]  are trained, they're ready. That's one reason the military and police are waking up because they're
[36:25.360 --> 36:29.840]  getting the training. George Washington's bad, the gun owners are bad, Christians are bad.
[36:30.640 --> 36:33.760]  And they're taking notes when people freak out and putting them in a database. I mean,
[36:33.760 --> 36:39.040]  this is a secret police takeover, like a foreign government took over or space aliens took over.
[36:39.040 --> 36:42.960]  It's that hardcore. You're living in the middle of a science fiction movie.
[36:44.400 --> 36:48.080]  And you see what they've done to other first world countries like Greece.
[36:48.080 --> 36:52.480]  They just year after year, they bankrupt them, they squeeze them, they bring in taxes,
[36:52.480 --> 36:56.640]  then go, this will pay your debt. That's all fake and the banker's debt that the banker
[36:56.640 --> 37:01.840]  operative signed them on to 90 plus percent. Then they break it down worse and go, we didn't know
[37:01.840 --> 37:10.400]  doing that would make the place go totally bankrupt. Oh, we had to buy everything up for nothing. Okay,
[37:10.400 --> 37:15.760]  and they're just going to keep squeezing and squeezing and squeezing and they'll bring in
[37:15.760 --> 37:19.680]  new leaders that will promise to fix it. And then they'll only squeeze and they'll bring in more
[37:19.680 --> 37:25.600]  leaders. We've got the enemy attack profile. We know who the globalist are. We know who their
[37:25.600 --> 37:33.520]  operations are. We know their plans and folks cash controls. Two things happen when they drop
[37:33.520 --> 37:37.280]  the hammer on a country. They do it country by country, the globalist, so they can contain it
[37:37.280 --> 37:45.520]  and control it. And it shows you how powerful they think they are that they're now going to go
[37:45.520 --> 37:51.280]  after Western Europe, Northern Europe, England, the UK, the United States, Australia, New Zealand,
[37:51.280 --> 37:55.920]  because they got to break the West. The West has built the world government because of our wealth
[37:55.920 --> 38:00.800]  and ingenuity, but now they're done with us. Now we've got to be brought down low.
[38:02.000 --> 38:05.200]  Coming up, Senate leaders announced agreement to end shutdown, raise debt.
[38:06.880 --> 38:10.800]  Top senators struck a deal just minutes ago to reopen the government and extend the federal
[38:10.800 --> 38:14.880]  government borrowing authority into next year on both sides of the Capitol, hoping for a quick
[38:14.880 --> 38:20.880]  action to reassure nervous financial markets. See how we were held hostage? So again, give Obama
[38:20.880 --> 38:26.480]  everything he wants, increase the debt limit, total Obamacare, and push it out into February.
[38:26.480 --> 38:30.800]  And then again, they'll hold his hostage again over and over and over again. This is the plan
[38:30.800 --> 38:35.360]  that was set to go through the February 7th deal. Government's funded through January 15th,
[38:35.360 --> 38:40.480]  and then they'll start it all over again, all over again. You see maneuvering us
[38:40.480 --> 38:45.360]  towards the cash controls. I'm going to get to that. The intel from high level sources
[38:46.240 --> 38:49.760]  is middle of next year is when they plan to drop the hammer completely.
[38:49.760 --> 38:55.040]  Now there's one thing that could stop them. Total awareness. If you get this info that you're
[38:55.040 --> 39:00.160]  seeing and listening to right now, people watching us on infoworks.com or prisonplanet.tv,
[39:00.160 --> 39:05.120]  folks listening to us on the radio right now, millions of you, if you take the data and say,
[39:05.120 --> 39:09.920]  take this video when it's on prisonplanet.tv tonight, the archive, and send it out to friends
[39:09.920 --> 39:16.800]  and family and explain it to them. I know it's not their favorite football game, you know,
[39:16.800 --> 39:20.480]  male soap opera or whatever. Or I know it's not your wife getting her hair done once a week.
[39:20.480 --> 39:23.520]  And I know it's not your wife getting her nails done. And I know it's all fun.
[39:24.960 --> 39:28.400]  I know it's fun to go to the football game and get your nails done and all the rest of it.
[39:28.400 --> 39:31.760]  And I called my wife today and I said, she works hard, does a great job. She was there
[39:31.760 --> 39:35.280]  getting her nails done and stuff. And I said, if you need to stop doing your nails for a while,
[39:35.280 --> 39:40.400]  we need to get everything in gear now. And I mean, I need to stop screwing around myself.
[39:40.400 --> 39:47.040]  And I don't really screw around, but it's time to get our butts in gear. I called my wife with
[39:47.040 --> 39:50.240]  this news right for the show. And I said, where are you? I said, I want you to go get some more
[39:50.240 --> 39:53.920]  cash out of the bank. We don't have much cash. And she said, well, I'm getting my hair done.
[39:53.920 --> 39:58.800]  And I said, fine. But I said, look, we've got to get our butt in gear. She goes, well, we do. We
[39:58.800 --> 40:04.880]  got two fences around our house. We moved to the country. We got weapons. We've got French bulldogs
[40:04.880 --> 40:08.640]  that are guards. I'm joking. These are real guard dogs. You know, we've got neighbors that are
[40:08.640 --> 40:13.440]  informed. We got the horrible food, blah, blah. And I said, we needed to get more. We need to stop
[40:13.440 --> 40:21.840]  worrying, myself included, about all this side corollary BS. We need to commit to working even
[40:21.840 --> 40:26.160]  harder to get the word out for everybody while we still have this platform. And I told her,
[40:26.160 --> 40:29.520]  I need your full support for me to work seven days a week.
[40:31.840 --> 40:35.520]  And she always supports me. She's a great wife. It's just that I told her, I said, listen,
[40:35.520 --> 40:40.640]  I just want you to know, I saw this coming so far off because historians and researchers saw it,
[40:40.640 --> 40:45.200]  a lot of experts. And if you know history, it's very clear. I said, but it's almost like you're
[40:45.200 --> 40:50.480]  blind and I'm blind. We have a blind spot politically because we're so accustomed and so
[40:50.480 --> 40:57.120]  acclimated and so ready for it that we're almost comfortable with it. And I don't want to just be
[40:57.120 --> 41:03.200]  comfortable with it. I don't want to have battle fatigue, psychological fatigue, and then just
[41:03.200 --> 41:10.560]  kind of lay down and not worry about it anymore. This is the time for maximum, maximum, maximum
[41:10.560 --> 41:15.920]  effort. Because of patriots in the last 60 years who knew about this plan, who saw it being done
[41:15.920 --> 41:22.400]  to other third world and old world countries, we have the enemy program. I've read stuff written
[41:22.400 --> 41:28.640]  by patriots in the fifties that has now come true exactly as they said. Cleon Scalzen,
[41:28.640 --> 41:36.320]  Naked Communist, Naked Capitalist, 1950s. I read that book when I was about 10 because I looked
[41:36.320 --> 41:39.920]  at it at my grandparents' house so long. They had a bookshelf in the bathroom of all places.
[41:39.920 --> 41:44.240]  They just had bookshelves in every room. They'd read so many books, a bar in full of books.
[41:44.960 --> 41:48.160]  They weren't TV heads. This is how my dad grew up. And I'd go there in the summers and I remember
[41:48.160 --> 41:51.760]  reading the Naked Communist. It was like reading space alien talk. I didn't know what it meant
[41:51.760 --> 41:57.840]  when I was 10 years old. Well, now I know it's all coming through, all of it. 1972,
[41:57.840 --> 42:04.960]  none dare call a conspiracy, all come true. Of course, you know it's nephew
[42:06.560 --> 42:13.200]  who comes on the show routinely. Joel Scalzen, the point is this, this is the real deal.
[42:17.200 --> 42:23.600]  This is the real deal. And currency controls and capital controls are the last thing to come along
[42:23.600 --> 42:29.040]  with one other thing when they hammer a country. In 2002, Joseph Sticklitz left the World Bank
[42:29.040 --> 42:33.120]  as his chief economist, Nobel Prize winner. He said it was too predatory, too evil. He would not
[42:33.120 --> 42:37.280]  be part of this evil plan. And people said, what is the evil plan? He said, I signed on disclosure
[42:37.280 --> 42:44.480]  agreements, but it's predatory and it's designed to wreck society. And he said, that's not what
[42:44.480 --> 42:49.440]  I've signed up to do. More of kind of a real liberal who really wanted to redistribute wealth.
[42:49.440 --> 42:54.560]  And then magically 2,000 pages of documents appeared at the BBC. And before national security
[42:54.560 --> 43:01.600]  denotus was issued to Greg Palast, about 100 pages or so got out. We got them. We published them.
[43:01.600 --> 43:08.080]  They went newspapers around the world. Palast got them to us as the denotus came through.
[43:09.280 --> 43:16.000]  And as the MI5 people basically stormed the offices, we were able to get them out in 2002.
[43:16.000 --> 43:24.240]  And the plan has 111 point program. And one of the points is called the IMF
[43:24.240 --> 43:27.120]  riot. I want to get Greg Palast on next week if we can do it, guys.
[43:29.360 --> 43:34.000]  Investigative Journalist, former federal fraud top investigator. That's how I got into all this.
[43:34.960 --> 43:39.440]  And the plan is you start currency controls. You don't want people to get their money out.
[43:39.440 --> 43:43.920]  You pass regulations saying you can't leave if they just start a tax investigation on you.
[43:43.920 --> 43:47.040]  They're now staying homeless. Security will just do that without even the IRS being able
[43:47.040 --> 43:51.360]  to pass a law this year. Remember that? It's all happening. Of course, you can't leave. I mean,
[43:51.360 --> 43:55.440]  it's on. I mean, they're really doing it. And where you can't wire your money out of the country.
[43:56.000 --> 44:02.160]  They want to rob everybody. And then the next thing they do is they turn off the welfare checks
[44:02.160 --> 44:07.280]  on purpose. And they always blame the opposition that's trying to save the country and blaming
[44:07.280 --> 44:12.560]  the foreign bankers. I've watched this in Mexico, Brazil, Nigeria. I've watched it in my 20 years
[44:12.560 --> 44:17.680]  of research every month that's going on somewhere. There's an exact program. Well,
[44:17.680 --> 44:23.360]  Stiklitz, when he left, he says he didn't release the documents. We believe him. The documents came out
[44:26.400 --> 44:32.960]  where they have this program, lower level economic hit man, John Perkins. We need to get him back on.
[44:34.560 --> 44:39.200]  John Perkins, you know, was working for the Pentagon and the CIA as a private contractor.
[44:39.200 --> 44:43.680]  He would go into third world countries and go meet with the president and say, okay, I've already,
[44:43.680 --> 44:47.680]  you've already been given offers. You will take these investments. You'll take the 15 million
[44:47.680 --> 44:51.840]  we're going to give you in your Swiss bank account, or you're going to be dead. And usually they'd
[44:51.840 --> 44:57.040]  say, Senor, I don't want to hurt my people. They'd say, well, you better think about what you want
[44:57.040 --> 45:03.760]  to do. Because when they pull me out, they send in the jackals. Those are the hit teams. You understand
[45:03.760 --> 45:15.440]  me? I guess I'm moving to Switzerland, Senor. But my family has been here hundreds of years,
[45:15.440 --> 45:20.880]  and I wanted to be a good president. You do what we say, or you and your family,
[45:22.560 --> 45:29.280]  you know, you do what we say. And now they're going to do it here. Now they're going to do it
[45:29.280 --> 45:32.800]  here. And they're going to take your guns. Your kids are going to belong to them. They're going to
[45:32.800 --> 45:37.520]  be in youth brigades to get their check. Everyone will still get their little EBT cards. But finally,
[45:37.520 --> 45:41.600]  what the conservatives have always wanted is you're going to have forced national labor. That's
[45:41.600 --> 45:46.880]  already being proposed and pushed just to graduate high school every year until you're an old woman
[45:46.880 --> 45:52.160]  or old man. You're going to serve in government brigades. They've already beta tested them. I
[45:52.160 --> 45:56.640]  ran into the brigades yesterday on the streets calling the police on me because I dared go on
[45:56.640 --> 46:02.800]  a green belt that was closed because it rained. They all are going to have their little card that
[46:02.800 --> 46:06.720]  gets its little creds on. They'll have a couple other jobs, but they'll need that. It'll all be
[46:06.720 --> 46:10.800]  actuary, but you've got to have that little card, that little national homeland security card that
[46:10.800 --> 46:14.320]  shows you've been checked and you're part of the team. And you'll even get to go through a faster
[46:14.320 --> 46:18.000]  line at the airport and you'll be part of the team. And you know, your parents will be proud of
[46:18.000 --> 46:21.360]  you. You'll have your little uniform and you know, you'll live in the room out back. And
[46:21.360 --> 46:24.720]  you know what? If your parents don't like it, you'll report them and you'll become a captain.
[46:24.720 --> 46:30.400]  They'll actually let you into the actual armed forces of the domestic national stability force.
[46:31.840 --> 46:36.000]  John Johnson or whatever your name is, if you do the right thing and report your father.
[46:36.720 --> 46:41.840]  And it'll be sad when they take Gad away for reeducation, but the guys will take you for
[46:41.840 --> 46:45.920]  drinks after. They're really going to be watching you to see if you're going to turn. But if you
[46:45.920 --> 46:50.800]  don't and go, you know, my dad deserves it, they're going to say, congratulations, sergeant. You're
[46:50.800 --> 46:59.280]  now on the team. Congratulations. And that's how it's all going to go. I've studied it everywhere
[46:59.280 --> 47:03.040]  else and they're coming. Of course, here's the deal. It ain't going to happen here like that,
[47:03.040 --> 47:07.520]  punks. We're going to take it all back and you're all going to go to prison. And I'm not worried
[47:07.520 --> 47:11.760]  about what happens to me in the final equation. You're going to be beaten because we know who you
[47:11.760 --> 47:16.560]  are. We know your battle plan. You're not doing this in the dark like you've done in all these
[47:16.560 --> 47:21.520]  other countries. We've been here warning people and being laughed at. They're not laughing. No
[47:21.520 --> 47:26.560]  one's laughing anymore except the dumbest democratic party idiots who think they're part of the power
[47:26.560 --> 47:33.680]  structure. No one is laughing anymore. The military special warfare is not laughing anymore.
[47:35.280 --> 47:39.680]  They saw what you do to them blowing up the Navy Seals. They know all the bin Laden raid
[47:39.680 --> 47:46.320]  was fake. They know everything. So you're going to do this at high noon out in front of everybody.
[47:46.320 --> 47:49.360]  You're going to strike me down. I don't want to die. But you don't want to bet. Colonel
[47:49.360 --> 47:55.280]  Travis didn't want to die either. I'm committed 100% and it feels so good and so right. I wish
[47:55.280 --> 48:00.320]  I had a thousand lives to give for humanity. I wish I had a thousand lives. I wish I had a thousand
[48:00.320 --> 48:08.640]  families to give for humanity. It doesn't matter. I'm all in and we now need to go out to everyone
[48:08.640 --> 48:14.320]  we know in an emergency information warfare operation and exercise our first amendment
[48:14.320 --> 48:20.320]  and hit the overpasses and have the open carries and warn the police and warn the military and put
[48:20.320 --> 48:25.680]  the government in check and let them know. Join aside the new order foreign banks that are going
[48:25.680 --> 48:33.600]  to wreck everything and destroy our prosperity and totally enslave us or freedom and liberty that
[48:33.600 --> 48:38.160]  created all this wealth and prosperity. I mean my goodness it's not even hard to choose the right
[48:38.160 --> 48:42.000]  thing except so many of you are cowards deep down inside. You're scared of the system. You know

[54:31.760 --> 54:38.400]  prosperity so people don't really have a lot of opportunities because the collectivists can't
[54:38.400 --> 54:43.120]  have competition with their takeover and they don't want collectivism to build people up they
[54:43.120 --> 54:47.520]  want collectivism to get control of people to carry out population control measures and that's

[55:31.600 --> 55:37.920]  up there could be two globalists in a high tech ivory tower 20 years in the future
[55:37.920 --> 55:42.160]  if they successfully carry all this out and and say have killed everyone on the planet but themselves
[55:42.160 --> 55:46.080]  hypothetically they actually claim an internal documents about one person will be allowed to

[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:39.520]  they drink out of bpa when they're pregnant it massively increases miscarriages and that's one
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:43.840]  of the reasons they designed the plastics out of thousands of different types made sure this was
[01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:51.440]  deployed worldwide but also gives men cancer women cancer and also makes all mammals uh
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:56.880]  become sexually confused in their endocrine systems and makes male animals become attracted

[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:24.720]  times now they're not angry they're like yeah he's right he's right we've got a bpa free section
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:31.040]  so i mean i'm just a normal guy hey that's a chemical weapon by the enemy i'm just you know
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:38.480]  wow that's weird that i care about some woman you know we have a crew member here at the office who
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:47.680]  had a little baby girl massively premature and she and she's just gone through living hell
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:52.320]  but she's made it she's really cute i've seen photos of her in the spirit in her eyes and
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:57.120]  everything that family's gone through it's just hellish with the feeding tube and everything else
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:02.480]  now i guess it's been about five six months since the baby was born and um
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:10.560]  i'm not like the globalist you see i actually do ask every day how's your daughter i actually do
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:18.000]  empathize with having to go through that i actually actually think about things like that a lot
[01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:23.120]  and see evil people my whole life have used the fact that i'm a real person and i'm loving
[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:28.480]  they've used my good side against me but see i've learned how to become a man where i'm also
[01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:33.920]  mean and aggressive to bad people and now i don't just trust people right off the bat so i'm loving
[01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:40.880]  and i have empathy for people but for the empathy i have i'm much meaner than than than even the most
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:46.240]  evil people who try to be mean and that's what i'm saying to good people out there it's time for you
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:51.120]  to understand that just because you're a sweet loving nice person you can't just be sweet and
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:54.960]  loving and have empathy in the world's going to be okay and let the globalist use your empathy
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:04:02.240]  to sign on to their fraudulent programs the devil's chariot is pulled by so many well-meaning people
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:05.680]  that just buy into the line oh well he says he wants to give all ladies free houses and
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:11.840]  take care of poor people and give me free health care and i want to buy into that because i want
[01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:16.080]  to believe that i think we should take middle classes people money and take care of poor folks
[01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:21.920]  and to them it's a moral high ground they just want to say they're moral
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:28.480]  and then feel like they're better than you and then that's the end of it
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:35.360]  but every time now i see a pregnant woman i tell her don't take vaccines sometimes their husband
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:39.040]  acts like they want to physically attack me i just look at them with love and i'll say listen i got
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:43.360]  three kids i don't mean to get in your business we're not supposed to talk to each other people

[01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:21.440]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.520]  well you know government defaults already happened twice in this country before
[01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:39.360]  the reason it's all a fraud is that earlier this year as you know they had a debt limit
[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:44.400]  they couldn't get it passed and so they just did accounting manipulations for more than two months
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:49.840]  to say that the us debt was not going up remember that i mean everybody forgets that so why were
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:56.240]  they making it a big deal this time so that they can get obama care through finally so that they
[01:08:56.240 --> 01:09:01.680]  can make everybody think that our lives depend on the federal government and now the head of the
[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:06.000]  park service we're going to play a clip here in a few minutes has come out and admitted that he was
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:12.160]  indeed in contact with a white house no kidding but that he made the decision how many of these
[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:18.160]  agency heads have we caught over and over and over again
[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:25.600]  how many of them we caught with their back channel emails like the irs head and others
[01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:29.840]  who said she wasn't ordered by the white house to persecute people and of course she was and why
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:38.160]  isn't she been indicted for perjury not just for not just for persecuting people they're getting
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:45.280]  away with classical hardcore tyranny on a scale of one to ten it's about seven i mean people
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:52.160]  like hitler and and and linen and stall on her tens folks a seven's a big deal i mean this is a
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:58.400]  big big thing they're getting away with here and so now they say that they have come to a
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:05.920]  debt increase and government agreement about 30 minutes ago here's the headline of the washington
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:12.080]  times senate leaders announced agreement in shut down raised debt top senator struck a deal today
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:16.720]  to reopen the government and extend the federal government's borrowing authority until next year
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:22.240]  february 7th the federal government itself will be funded through january 15th so three months
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:33.360]  now again ladies and gentlemen separately they're using all of this as a drill as they deliver the
[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:38.080]  armored vehicles as they train the riot police with the local police that's in the news as they
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:43.200]  prepare to limit cash withdrawals and to shut off welfare they're wargaming into the future because
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:50.000]  they know you go 16 17 18 20 25 trillion it's already untenable it's already more at that point
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:55.920]  than the gdp each year it already is gross domestic product and so they've completed our
[01:10:55.920 --> 01:11:00.560]  journey into enslavement now they just have to do the conversion make sure the puppet government
[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:07.520]  says that all that debts ours when we're signed on to the 644 trillion that they claim is the us
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:15.360]  share of global derivatives overhang of 1.5 trill 1.5 quadrille which is 1 500 trill that
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:20.480]  numbers four years old the numbers have not been re-released since then but mainstream media says
[01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:29.840]  1.5 quadrille us say today 644 trill the debt of the us not our debt foreign banks made these
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:35.200]  derivatives didn't even spend them didn't even really use them made money off the trading of them
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:40.400]  off trade fees have have infected all the major pension funds public and private and are holding
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:45.440]  everyone hostage they've already triage it's already sitting there but they go you're going to pay for
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:51.440]  it because they need that control over us and they use the financial ignorance of the public
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:57.280]  to sell this so again as i said earlier in the first hour before this even happened regardless
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:04.560]  this is a big drill getting us ready for the collapse middle of next year max two years from now
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:08.640]  all of our financial experts concur which now coming down and then you notice they're gearing
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:13.040]  up everywhere let me give you this new constellation of articles that ties into this as data points
[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:20.160]  for you and i'll get into other news ahead of a big special report we saw this we noticed this
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:30.480]  yesterday and i talked about it and showed it on tv for radio listeners they can go to the archive
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:36.160]  of prism upon it on tv and see it because most of our listeners most people that listen or watch
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:41.200]  the show are just radio listeners probably 95 percent over 90 percent the rest uh watch us on
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:48.320]  prism planet dot tv and in full wars dot comports last show but rachel madel told a whole bunch of
[01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:53.120]  lies she said that the veterans came on sunday and threw barricades at police she said they
[01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:58.400]  attacked the police first she said that the police weren't paid we went looked it up those police are
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:05.200]  paid they're all paid all the police on duty are paid there's some administrative in dc uh for the
[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:10.400]  district but then also the federal police the white house police the capital police they're all
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:16.720]  there all essential 80 plus percent and that's been on the news rachel madel lied and said that
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:22.320]  they were not being paid while they were being attacked and then she kept cutting to the same
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:27.840]  video we showed last sunday on a live feed and then clipped out and kept showing of the veterans
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:34.720]  being charged by riot police who then hit them with billy clubs shoving them back and then the
[01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:40.320]  veterans push back the young police that looks like he's 75 and just you know throws this one cop
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:45.600]  back and the cops are shaking in fear it's just ridiculous because they only hire trendies now
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:51.200]  these people only think about protecting themselves and socialism and the other great utopia they're
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:56.000]  not warriors folks police all day now only worry about their safety what you should worry about
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.400]  your safety but that's secondary you should not have that job if you're shaking in your boots in
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:06.080]  fear you shouldn't be a soldier you shouldn't be a cop you is ridiculous but again that's the nanny
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:10.640]  state get them in that mindset now they're not protectors except for their own butts but the
[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:15.840]  point is so instead we have all these videos of them bullying women and people in wheelchairs
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:20.640]  they would go around younger troops or guys that look like you know they had a little bit of sauce
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:25.120]  in them had a can of what but in their in their in their pocket and they would literally go and
[01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:30.000]  then attack wheelchair people and shove them and hit them and because that's what they do they are
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:34.880]  just a pack of scum and they always have special units now in every big city department that are
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:42.880]  the trendy police who kind of just waddle around and who was the sports guy that talks real effeminate
[01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:49.200]  not bob costas no no the sports guy he would like jump around and do
[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:51.040]  jazzer size and all that early stuff
[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:58.080]  Richard Simmons it's basically Richard Simmons in combat gear
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:02.880]  and then going i'm giving you a ticket for walking on the sidewalk on the edge of federal
[01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:07.840]  property at the national mall oh you're foreign students coming to see the great lakes we're
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:12.640]  going to arrest you oh you're coming to see the west coast by seattle you didn't know this was
[01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:18.400]  federal property i'm writing you all 125 dollar tickets now let's get ready to do some exercises
[01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:27.360]  i mean it is amazing to see the rule of the of the parasite the rule of the coward the rule of the
[01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:28.640]  of the trendy
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:37.280]  i just showed a clip of Richard Simmons no offense to him nothing against how he talks but
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:42.480]  he's not out there trying to be a commando i mean that's really the difference here it's just the
[01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:47.920]  affront of them coming over and then Rachel Maddow this is coming up the bottom of the hour Rachel
[01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:54.560]  Maddow comes over and keeps showing the clip of the old guy shoving the cop back and she goes
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:16:01.200]  he they attack them with no pay and she knows she's lying everything she says is a lie i mean
[01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:07.200]  it's amazing to see 100% lies i mean it's hard to just be a pure liar i mean it takes skill
[01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:13.280]  to invert reality but that's what the enemy does and they are an enemy group they see us
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:18.160]  as the enemy they know we're the enemy their white papers are out folks these are military
[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:23.440]  operations i'll guarantee you Rachel Maddow and her top producers and the people at that facility
[01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:28.560]  hold hold rank in the new world order hold corporate and many times intelligence rank
[01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:34.400]  it's come in anderson cooper cia i mean most of the top anchors and and people you see on cnn msm
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:39.680]  especially are agents of foreign powers i'll tell you right now ladies and gentlemen these are
[01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:44.960]  agents of foreign powers agents of the foreign banks who get taxpayer money with stimulus money
[01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:51.120]  and the rest of it worse than npr and they're up there waging war editing video of the cops
[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:57.280]  at ramming into vets and the vets notice she has no audio too because the vets are like we're peaceful
[01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:02.000]  we're peaceful and they keep ramming them so they push them back and then the police urinate
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:09.680]  basically on themselves and start shaking you mean we don't just get to attack people then
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:16.000]  the nothing else comes back it'd be like if they had ufc for trendies and they walk into the ring
[01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:22.080]  Simmons you know walks in the ring in a diaper and then and then whoever he's going to beat up
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:26.720]  is chained up in a chair and he comes up starts whacking him with a baseball bat going trendy
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:33.200]  trendy i mean that's what they think this is we ought to do ufc for trendies you have like
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:41.520]  you know some huge top uh el guapo or something uh you know at his peak or whatever and and chained
[01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:46.400]  up can't even move hands are chained down and then just have have Simmons just hop around
[01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:51.920]  maybe with a small hatchet like whoever the top ufc guy is you know one of those monkeys where
[01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:55.280]  they chain them down and beat the top of their head out and then eat the brain live and just
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:18:00.160]  have trendies dance around in tutus with small hatchets hacking whoever the toughest person is
[01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:04.800]  in the head and then they all just eat their brain while troops with machine guns guard them and
[01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:09.920]  then have temples of weakness and fraud have temples of worshiping scum have temples of
[01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:15.120]  worshiping the destruction of men and women and children and just temples to failure just
[01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:20.240]  for the weakest rule everything and just dominate anything beautiful and good how's that sound
[01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:27.040]  does that sound like a good thing i'm telling you it'd be it'd be big you could have whoever
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:32.560]  the top ufc person is look up whoever the top heavyweight is right now chain down in the middle
[01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:39.680]  of the octagon and then have like people in tutus and stuff prance around like with little tiny
[01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:44.240]  hatchets just hacking them in the head i'm telling you that would be the number one sport for trendies
[01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:48.400]  because that's what they want they want to chain america down chain our families down
[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:54.000]  chain our industry down chain our jobs down and then just take their time prancing around all over

[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:34.640]  month i don't do that through chase but through a texas bank but the point is i'll guarantee
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:39.360]  it's going through some big wiring service that goes over the back of chase i mean this is a big
[01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:44.240]  deal we have the copy of their announcement everything and no one else is covering it oh
[01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:48.560]  hi neighbor you're not gonna get your money out of the country and the tsa if you have five silver
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:58.080]  coins will confiscate them there's no law neighbor oh hi uh we're just being friendly here you're not
[01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:04.320]  allowed to get any of your money out of the country and then here's another one crisis usda
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:10.000]  orders states to withhold electronic food stamps and a new article came out about more
[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:16.000]  food stamp problems and kit daniels wrote a story food stamps dependency riots lead to
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:22.400]  martial law but here's the paul watson article upon imprison planet dot com crisis usda orders
[01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:26.800]  states to withhold electronic food stamps
[01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:34.800]  and by the way this came out this morning and we the letters from yesterday
[01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:40.320]  but the point is we're breaking this is that they're still gearing up for it see all these
[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:46.080]  shutdowns and all this is about getting you ready for it just like carney the white house carnival
[01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:50.800]  barker remember the former white house chief of staff said we don't want a good crisis go
[01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:57.360]  to waste they've clearly been with the big globalist banks and and and outlets threatening the credit
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:01.440]  and faith of the country when they couldn't get the debt increased months ago they just froze it
[01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:06.480]  even though the debt was going up this time they hyped it they introduced that obama a week ago
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:10.880]  introduced that that was the signal well if you don't do the debt increase we'll get welfare checks
[01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:16.000]  things will collapse they began all this talk in the press with the communist chinese laughing at us
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:21.440]  saying america's bankrupt and using that for state propaganda they he started all this and
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:26.400]  then now carney comes out and says how dare the republicans and again folks i don't i'm
[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:31.280]  nonpartisan everybody knows that the republican tea party is totally in the right on this trying
[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:38.640]  to save the country we will go bankrupt by their system in the next year or so uh with accounting
[01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:46.160]  maybe two years with accounting manipulations if they continue to have a debt bigger than the gdp i
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:50.880]  mean we are being absolutely destroyed and they're saying no the reason we have debt problems is
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:55.600]  because there's not enough debt remember obama said raising the debt doesn't raise the debt so when
[01:28:55.600 --> 01:29:00.640]  we come back first i have carney said there's just minutes ago at a press conference that that that
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:10.960]  well he has a fruity and slip he says well you know um you know we use this as um leverage i mean
[01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:16.160]  they use it as leverage we're not going to let them use it as leverage and they just sit up
[01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:22.560]  there knowing their constituents on average are just helpless tv ads who were set in the
[01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:29.200]  in front of the television from birth in crap loaded diapers with snot and flies all over them

[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:56.000]  them back to fairness doctrine and talk radio where you can't even have political views only
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:59.840]  the government propaganda which is a political view the end of the first amendment because it's
[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:03.920]  racist i thought we'd play that homeland security announcement where they're being honest with you
[01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:07.920]  pentagon said two months ago they're gonna start being honest with you about the globalist overall

[01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:35.600]  india so you can't even have americans employed to have a welfare system that goes against bringing

[01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:46.880]  be able to wire money out of the country or get money out of the account anymore they will decide

[01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:13.200]  look for another job right now we wish we could unionize it's horrible we know the radiation's
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:17.360]  bad i do you know that's that's the difference that i get
[01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:27.920]  but let me just uh now since i mentioned it go to the
[01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:36.640]  j carney press conference um that's ongoing uh where he had a little Freudian slip and then
[01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:44.960]  we have the clip of the former white house chief of staff rom immanuel um telling you what he really
[01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:50.560]  thinks here it is i understand what you were saying about there's no winners but clearly the
[01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:58.160]  white house and the president wanted to establish a new norm no reopening of the government with
[01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:04.480]  what you consider to be partisan legislative attachments avoiding default with the same
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:10.800]  approach mm-hmm is that strategy been vindicated do you believe 16 days of shutdown was worth
[01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:18.320]  that effort to achieve that what we thought that was totally unnecessary and this was a
[01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:25.920]  manufactured crisis president's position from the beginning was uh that congress ought to pass a
[01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:33.600]  continuing resolution at existing funding levels he made no uh requests associated with that demanded
[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:39.680]  no concessions associated in return for signing a legislation to extend government funding uh to
[01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:44.640]  allow for broader budget negotiations so uh but he did want to push back on the idea that you could
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:50.480]  use either one of these pieces of these deadlines has levers has that been the president believes
[01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:56.000]  that it was the right position to take and it remains the right position to take that especially
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:02.400]  when it comes to the full faith and credit of the united states that neither he nor any of his
[01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:12.400]  successors can allow a dynamic to take root where raising the debt ceiling is used as leverage or
[01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:19.360]  the refusal to raise the debt ceiling is used as leverage to try to achieve some partisan policy
[01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:24.640]  objective all right that's enough folks the globalists that run this country that have hijacked this
[01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:28.720]  nation that literally have it captured and occupied and that's not rhetoric that's they brag about
[01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:33.120]  that publicly looking up the financial problems of london they laugh at us the communist chinese
[01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:39.040]  are laughing at us calling us their slaves right now in the news today we're now lectured by the
[01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:45.200]  imf the world bank by by by by chase that you know lobbies for more welfare to administer all their
[01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:49.680]  little slaves that they're sending credit cards who to get into debt this is the political takeover
[01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:57.520]  and he says that you know that that they don't use debt but that the republicans were using it
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:41:02.640]  to hijack and hold people hostage when they are maneuvering us towards bankruptcy and the globalists
[01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:07.920]  use debt limits to always hold countries hostage to get them deeper and deeper under globalist
[01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:14.080]  control until they raise your taxes sky high to bankrupt you on purpose not to give money to the
[01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:20.160]  bankers the bankers control all the fiat money and then all the poor people go we give trillions
[01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:24.240]  to foreign banks i can have some free health care there's gotta be something free for me
[01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:30.160]  you know you want a piece of it alexis join the team i'm tired of being poor you don't get it's
[01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:35.200]  the system that engineered itself this way that wants to make it worse on record to make you
[01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:43.520]  dependent you people don't listen and that's why you're in such bad shape now they want to make
[01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:48.160]  it where those of us that are smart enough to still know how to be successful in a system like this
[01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:53.120]  they want to shut that down too they don't like people like me having crew members they don't
[01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:58.560]  like small businesses and operations and media groups everything is written and set up legislatively
[01:41:58.560 --> 01:42:05.920]  to shut it down by the big boys who want combines and oligopolies and monopolies on record
[01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:10.000]  that's what we're facing do you get it the people that wrote this obama supporters
[01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:17.200]  are the most predatory vicious deceptive wicked people that when they have their ways
[01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:25.760]  with a population haliburton got caught all over the world when they have a captive population
[01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:33.120]  like iraq loading people on c 130s and flying them to foreign countries to work as slaves in brick
[01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:42.800]  factories and and textile fact i mean real slaves do you understand every one of these
[01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:48.160]  globalist companies doesn't just want the cheapest labor they don't want the public getting anything
[01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:55.520]  you don't get into their club unless you hate the general public and want to dumb them down and
[01:42:55.520 --> 01:43:01.120]  hurt them and see it as a war against them but those guys then use the very massive unwashed
[01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:07.200]  dumbed down spoiled lazy fluoride head people as a weapon against their enemy the virtuous
[01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:13.600]  middle class the artisan class they are at war with us because they know historically we are
[01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:21.680]  their downfall now you better wake up to this in Rome when Rome became corrupt they knocked out
[01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:26.480]  the middle class it's happened everywhere whole pot knocked out the middle class the communist
[01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:30.720]  knocked out the middle class wherever they were at doesn't matter fascist knock out the middle
[01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:38.400]  class and i'm i'm here talking to the dumboes out there i'm begging you i know you're listening
[01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:43.600]  to just admit your morons i mean i just i shouldn't talk to you like that it's just that you gotta
[01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:50.320]  admit you've been conned you signed on to an ijerian chain letter you got scammed just admit it
[01:43:54.640 --> 01:43:58.800]  or as each stage of the crisis gets worse you'll just beg even more like baby birds
[01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:04.160]  for Obama to vomit awful into your mouth that they stole from somebody some third world country or
[01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:09.200]  the middle class and that's only long enough to keep you in line for them to make sure they
[01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:13.600]  take out their enemy the middle class but for a lot of trendies and people that are anti-success
[01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:18.720]  you guys are like yeah you bet let's bring it all down you know it's true but you decide to join it
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:22.960]  nihilistically as if you have control over it because you accept it let's go to this other clip
[01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:27.520]  and then our big top story today premiering this report put together by Darren McBrain myself and
[01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:35.360]  adan Salazar uh let's go to the head of the park service in a smarmy little way covering for the
[01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:40.480]  white house and going well i did talk to them they don't make the mistake of lying like the irs lady
[01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:46.480]  the irs head of the tax regroups admit you talked to them like i'm gonna shut them down is that a
[01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:52.480]  problem you do whatever you think's needed there's sweets a cake they had other top park
[01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:58.480]  service people said they were ordered to make life miserable by this guy and this is the way
[01:44:58.480 --> 01:45:03.520]  they run their life and boy in this guy a carbon cutout of what you would have imagined the head
[01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:08.320]  of the park service looked like i think nothing has resonated more with the public than to see
[01:45:09.120 --> 01:45:17.280]  an open-air monument such as the world war two memorial and is that Richard Simmons brother
[01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:23.040]  the martin luther king memorial it just seems that common sense did not prevail
[01:45:24.160 --> 01:45:30.560]  did you now you said you take full responsibility for that action is that correct that's correct
[01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:37.040]  most corrupt and did you discuss this with the secretary of interior a jewel at any time yes i
[01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:42.560]  did and did he been closing his eyes we talked to discuss it with anyone in the white house
[01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:51.040]  i'm going to come on to us did you um in in several times you know what he's thinking about right
[01:45:51.040 --> 01:45:58.720]  there on with the white house i presented with the secretary my decision but it was never the
[01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:03.680]  reverse so there was never so you discussed with officials in the white house your action
[01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:11.040]  and you also discussed it with her her now the car so park service director i discussed closing
[01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:15.680]  monuments of the white house they had denied that earlier yes i did said director when i was going
[01:46:15.680 --> 01:46:22.320]  to discuss the closers with the secretary of the interior department he didn't he almost talks
[01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:28.080]  like that uh miss america like it was like such as americans helping did you discuss with anyone
[01:46:28.080 --> 01:46:34.960]  at the white house did you ask the congressman and the director uh dr dumb dumb uh went ahead and
[01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:43.680]  said that he did okay let's get serious now and shift gears into the report that is up on info
[01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:54.560]  wars dot com if you are a radio listener you can go to info wars dot com and get this article
[01:46:55.920 --> 01:47:00.800]  it is very important that everyone get this article and send it out to your friends and family
[01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:07.520]  because it catches them red-handed framing the veterans and engaging in pure lies and it's not
[01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:16.400]  about it's not about janet rino's daughter rachel mato it's about the fact that they're so deceptive
[01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:20.960]  and and are so skilled he's actually like a olympic level athlete of deception she makes
[01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:25.520]  bill clinton pale in significance or at least her teleprompter writer did uh there at the
[01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:33.040]  government funded msnbc nbc edits video to frame veterans uh here is the darren mcbrane report
[01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:38.000]  and obviously the video is much more powerful so go to info wars dot com uh and watch the report
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:43.600]  and then get it out to everyone you know because this frame up of vets uh is is is really powerful
[01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:48.720]  when we're able to expose it and and and like a judo move throw it back at him here it is last
[01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:56.000]  night on msnbc rachel madow covered the veterans march that took place over the weekend and in
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:02.880]  stereotypical mainstream fashion she deliberately distorted and falsified the facts surrounding
[01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:09.200]  the protest first she made it look like the veterans march was organized by the tea party
[01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:15.520]  led by ted cruz and sarah palin and she said it was a small demonstration and once again
[01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:22.080]  pulled out the race card insinuating that the veterans rally was somehow racially motivated
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:26.480]  vaguely threatening but incoherent is a patented thing with these folks it has never ever held
[01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:31.440]  them back like say this guy who brought the confederate flag to the rally to wave it in front
[01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:35.840]  of the white house yes an african-american family lives in the house oh my gosh okay i think the
[01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:39.840]  idea here was more about waving a confederate flag in front of a house where a black family lives
[01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:44.720]  than it was about anything specific related to the marines and of course they kept showing footage
[01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:50.720]  of this one guy who was out there with his confederate flag but failed to show the incredible
[01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:58.800]  amount of veterans who showed up including yes black veterans and that's because most everyone
[01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:04.880]  is extremely outraged right now about the obama administration putting up barricades
[01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:12.000]  and denying veterans access to our nation's memorials don't need to perform the constitution
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:18.880]  you have to have to do these veterans served our country they put their life in line they have
[01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:23.280]  MPs out with the police giving tickets to veterans you don't lock their access to the memorial
[01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:30.240]  surely you got more dignity and respect to that you're gonna spit on their graves as well when
[01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:37.440]  they die but rachel maddow's line to her audience got worse she claimed that the veterans for example
[01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:44.240]  were throwing the barricades at the white house which did not happen they then picked up the barricades
[01:49:44.240 --> 01:49:50.000]  that were around the closed world war two memorial and dragged the barricades over to the white house
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:56.160]  and hurled the barricades at the white house but the big lie was when she told her audience
[01:49:56.160 --> 01:50:02.080]  that the police were not getting paid then the protesters went home so the police who threw no
[01:50:02.080 --> 01:50:06.320]  fault of their own are working without being paid the police had to pick up those barriers
[01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:11.040]  dragged them back to where they came from and keep working their shifts without being paid
[01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:15.120]  because of the shutdown that these folks made happen wait a minute let's stop right there
[01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:20.480]  notice they keep showing a video loop of a veteran who is pushing one of the riot police
[01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:27.200]  backwards what msnbc failed to show their audience was the fact that it was the riot police who
[01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:34.880]  lashed out at veterans first you can clearly see this cop pushing the veteran before the veteran
[01:50:34.880 --> 01:50:42.640]  pushes back msnbc deliberately edited that part out of the video and as far as the cops not being
[01:50:42.640 --> 01:50:50.000]  paid during the shutdown it's on record that all patrol and riot police are seen as essential
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:56.240]  they're all on duty and they're all getting paid one two three four five six seven eight nine ten
[01:50:56.240 --> 01:51:01.120]  little backup so the police they're gonna yell that they're are working without pay while the
[01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:05.680]  shutdown goes about woman's incredible and working without pay includes now getting screamed at
[01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:15.280]  for being at work is very threat is very lobbying and extra police and a lot of war two veterans
[01:51:15.280 --> 01:51:21.200]  that showed up for the march over the weekend and no world war two veterans should be denied
[01:51:21.200 --> 01:51:28.080]  access to the iwo jima memorial or the world war two memorial or to any other memorial for that
[01:51:28.080 --> 01:51:34.800]  matter and the fact that they were denied access should be a wake-up call to us all the enemy is
[01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:43.120]  no longer foreign it is domestic so remember you can't trust msnbc you can't trust rachel madow
[01:51:43.120 --> 01:51:50.400]  and don't fall for the race card those memorials belong to us each and every one of us and as long
[01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:56.000]  as they're out there putting up barricades it's up to all of us to get out there support our veterans
[01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:03.680]  tear those barricades down and send a clear message to obama that we're not about to back down
[01:52:03.680 --> 01:52:10.080]  i'm darryl mcbrane for info wars dot com all right there you go in the full report without my
[01:52:10.640 --> 01:52:18.160]  commentary is up on info wars dot com right now it's up on info wars dot com right now and
[01:52:18.160 --> 01:52:27.680]  prison planet dot com report nbc edits video to frame veterans and what's so sick about this is
[01:52:27.680 --> 01:52:31.760]  people say why do they keep calling anybody that doesn't want total government or wants to keep
[01:52:31.760 --> 01:52:38.560]  our guns or actually knows obama cares a scam racist because they know you know that isn't true
[01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:46.480]  they are trying to brand it for minorities who are really the majority now all put together
[01:52:46.480 --> 01:52:53.600]  in this country that not turning your guns in not having socialist health care that's a scam
[01:52:54.560 --> 01:53:00.880]  is racist so that black folks don't feel like or hispanics or others they can come out to a tea
[01:53:00.880 --> 01:53:05.760]  party or they can come out to a pro gun rally or they can come out to a demonstration about the
[01:53:05.760 --> 01:53:10.400]  memorials being shut down when the rest of the memorials aren't any illegal aliens can go have
[01:53:10.400 --> 01:53:17.520]  demonstrations there do you understand that folks i mean there have been demonstrations out at the
[01:53:17.520 --> 01:53:21.520]  grand canyon about it being shut down by the local business owners of all race colors and creeds
[01:53:21.520 --> 01:53:27.440]  has nothing to do with black people or whatever but they inject that so that people don't come
[01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:32.560]  together and don't feel like liberty is theirs oh that's only for old white people i don't i don't
[01:53:32.560 --> 01:53:38.000]  want a right to have a gun i want to live in chicago or new york or dc where you know i've
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:42.480]  got a right as a black person to live in a black city and not have my guns don't you see you're in
[01:53:42.480 --> 01:53:47.200]  a black city where they push abortion on you 24 seven and a and you don't have a right to own
[01:53:47.200 --> 01:53:52.480]  guns and they pump gangster culture in to make sure everybody kills each other and then use examples
[01:53:52.480 --> 01:53:57.920]  of areas they run in control to tell all the other areas of the country oh look turn your guns in
[01:53:57.920 --> 01:54:04.080]  people owning guns made people get killed in chicago the nr a's the new clan and they know full
[01:54:04.080 --> 01:54:10.480]  well when the democratic party puts that talking point out on msnbc cnn fox sports bob costis all
[01:54:10.480 --> 01:54:17.280]  of it they know full well the nr a was founded mainly by abolitionists at the end of the civil
[01:54:17.280 --> 01:54:23.440]  war to train blacks how to use guns they know that full well that's the sick joke to them you see
[01:54:24.160 --> 01:54:29.840]  that's what's so incredibly luscious about these lies to the globalist is that is that
[01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:39.360]  that it's so incredibly over the top the lies are such a wall of fraud that the average person

[01:57:09.280 --> 01:57:16.080]  with taxpayer money we fund ourselves with citizens supporting us i did research for two years deeply
[01:57:16.080 --> 01:57:20.320]  a year and found from all the medical doctors scientists nutritionists that nasa and iodine
[01:57:20.320 --> 01:57:25.040]  was the way to go but that you couldn't find it and all the competitors we went with it tasted
[01:57:25.040 --> 01:57:28.640]  horrible and made me feel bad and i talked to top doctors and they said that's probably not real
[01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:35.280]  nasa and iodine i found the one laboratory that makes it doctor group it's all sold out be three
[01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:43.600]  weeks till we get more it's in a non-gmo organic vegetable base glycerin base and it's amazing

[01:57:53.760 --> 01:57:58.400]  behind trying to ship it all out but it should all be shipped everybody's already ordered as of now
[01:57:58.400 --> 01:58:02.000]  in the next week or so most people've already gotten it but a little bit we're still getting
[01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:07.040]  the last third out we sold out the last bunch that came in we're doing a huge run biggest run yet
[01:58:08.880 --> 01:58:12.800]  they had to even put in another bottling machine to be able to do it just a small

[02:00:29.360 --> 02:00:35.120]  doing the report right now things on the nightly news tonight a document he got through lawsuits
[02:00:35.120 --> 02:00:40.480]  with the loving tsa you know they declared national security on alex jones and matt drudge and others

[02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:59.360]  documents said they're not really for terrorism so don't worry about that of course they the
[02:00:59.360 --> 02:01:04.160]  government runs that it's about currency controls it's about controlling the slaves
[02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:07.600]  which we already knew because look at what they do and tell what they're for
[02:01:08.160 --> 02:01:12.080]  it'd be like if a dog ran up a tree and was barking at a coon it looked like a coon dog i go
[02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:15.680]  is that a coon dog well of course it's a coon dog i mean it's like
[02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:21.600]  it'd be like if you're looking at uh maryland and roe and her prime
[02:01:22.480 --> 02:01:28.240]  norma jean and you ask is that a bombshell blonde i don't know it'd be like looking at this
[02:01:28.240 --> 02:01:33.520]  government saying is this a big fat stinking rat infested tyranny of control freak scumbags
[02:01:33.520 --> 02:01:39.280]  wanting to absolutely enslave us on sicko power trips but even ain't there's never been one
[02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:48.480]  i mean this is the biggest nastiest slobber and stinkiest vicious most pus filled giant maggot
[02:01:49.520 --> 02:01:53.920]  infested creature i've ever seen in my life so that's some of the news we've got
[02:01:54.640 --> 02:01:59.840]  some of the news up on drudgereport.com next obama vows immigration push mercy
[02:02:00.480 --> 02:02:07.280]  reed mcconnell reached deal white house no winners except golden sacks and jp morgan they
[02:02:07.280 --> 02:02:16.080]  they brought you tonight's jokes and no matter no matter if you laugh or not they still laugh
[02:02:16.080 --> 02:02:22.960]  remember obama said that viral photo of public sex act at university sparks rape allegations
[02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.480]  that's just some of the news we're going to be
[02:02:28.480 --> 02:02:36.640]  breaking down drudge reports that even crews folded and vote for it
[02:02:37.680 --> 02:02:41.600]  and then the flashback of crews saying life or death you know what happened is
[02:02:43.440 --> 02:02:49.440]  the republican leadership that's patriotic realized that they want to direct the whole
[02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:53.440]  country and have the debt limit go down so obama could basically become a dictator
[02:02:53.440 --> 02:03:00.960]  and that if they let him have his obama care now he can get the blame for it and i got to say
[02:03:00.960 --> 02:03:04.640]  mitch mcconnell first said that a few weeks ago and i wasn't sure if i agreed with it
[02:03:04.640 --> 02:03:09.200]  we wore game that idea ron paul last friday agreed he said no that is the way to go
[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:14.800]  we've tried to beat it it's already going to go down it's going to go down with dead increases
[02:03:15.840 --> 02:03:20.320]  we've got to fight it each time but when they hold us hostage at least this time you've got to let
[02:03:20.320 --> 02:03:25.120]  them have it because the constituents are too stupid we have to let obama care hurt them first
[02:03:28.240 --> 02:03:36.320]  and so i'm not here apologizing for ted crews i'm just saying i i myself as of last friday said
[02:03:36.320 --> 02:03:41.200]  ron paul isn't it really time to agree with mitch mcconnell as much as i hate saying that
[02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:46.720]  that we've tried to beat this we're trying to do the moral thing they won't let us stop
[02:03:46.720 --> 02:03:50.960]  maybe we can cue that up later in the next hour we're already in the next hour but
[02:03:51.520 --> 02:03:55.040]  find it towards the end of the interview with ron paul it's like 20 minutes long
[02:03:55.040 --> 02:03:59.440]  and he said no no i think that's right i fought health care takeover you fought it
[02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:04.560]  we tried to stop it but now we're just going to get the blame let them have it
[02:04:05.440 --> 02:04:11.040]  it's going to fail let them have it let it be their baby now obama is just going to blow
[02:04:11.040 --> 02:04:14.480]  something up and blame it on patriots before he gets the blame anyways or start a big war but
[02:04:14.480 --> 02:04:20.480]  i mean maybe that's wrong maybe we should open the phones up in overdrive or something
[02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:27.520]  because i got pharmacist ben fuchs coming on with some medical news but what do you think about this
[02:04:27.520 --> 02:04:34.000]  i mean i mean it is true even crews folds flashback this is life or death he said he said i won't
[02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:39.600]  delay debt bill and that's because obama says the republicans are holding his hostage it's the
[02:04:39.600 --> 02:04:45.440]  opposite he's trying to bankrupt us keep raising the debt ceiling cut nothing only increase give
[02:04:45.440 --> 02:04:50.240]  trillions more to foreign banks rape everybody with obama care a few good republicans try to
[02:04:50.240 --> 02:04:55.440]  hold it up the republican leadership goes after them ted cruise tries to stand against it and then
[02:04:55.440 --> 02:04:59.840]  we're going to get the blame as libertarians for what they've done so fine have your disaster have

[02:11:00.560 --> 02:11:06.080]  who's depositing what unless you're a billionaire socialist then you are tax exempt and above the
[02:11:06.080 --> 02:11:15.200]  law aka uh the uh french socialist so that's some of the news uh on that front and here is the
[02:11:15.760 --> 02:11:20.800]  on intelograph the sun is setting on dollar supremacy and with it american power no matter
[02:11:20.800 --> 02:11:25.040]  how many dead increases they do they've now bankrupted us and the globalists will move on to the next
[02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:31.280]  country uh phitch puts u.s credit rating under review for downgrade because they didn't capitulate
[02:11:31.280 --> 02:11:35.600]  to the bankers fast enough just like greece and the more you capitulate the worse things get
[02:11:35.600 --> 02:11:42.240]  but so what the public doesn't care there's a football game on today so that's just some of
[02:11:42.240 --> 02:11:49.760]  the news on that front but the biggest news of the day i've got to say is chase bank sending
[02:11:49.760 --> 02:11:54.160]  letters to their customers we have copies of them up there we've called them it's real letters
[02:11:54.160 --> 02:12:00.320]  saying no foreign wire transfers anybody doing even moderate size business is doing foreign
[02:12:00.320 --> 02:12:06.400]  wire transfers i wire money to paul watson every month as a contractor he's a contractor not an
[02:12:06.400 --> 02:12:13.840]  employee over in the uk uh and uh i'm not doing wires with chase but the whole point is is that
[02:12:13.840 --> 02:12:18.800]  they wouldn't be doing that unless it's going to be system wide and i mean that is so draconian
[02:12:19.680 --> 02:12:24.640]  you can even do foreign wire transfers you live in like places like i ran i mean only though i
[02:12:24.640 --> 02:12:30.880]  think north korea you can't do them so i mean this is this this is insane and they're going to limit
[02:12:30.880 --> 02:12:36.720]  well how much cash you can get out so it's official they run the whole show they run america chase is
[02:12:36.720 --> 02:12:44.960]  the jewel in the crown of the foreign banks that run america and set up the federal reserve 100
[02:12:45.520 --> 02:12:52.880]  100 years ago on december 23 100 years of the shareholders of jp morgan chase now merged jp
[02:12:52.880 --> 02:12:57.200]  morgan and chase were involved at the time uh running this country directly into the ground
[02:12:57.200 --> 02:13:02.640]  and they ran the takeover of ireland and the takeover of grace the takeover of everybody else
[02:13:02.640 --> 02:13:09.920]  absolutely incredible uh article i mean here's an example crisis usda orders states to withhold
[02:13:09.920 --> 02:13:16.960]  electronic food stamps that's important but it has 919 comments look at chase bank limits cash
[02:13:16.960 --> 02:13:24.000]  withdrawals bans international transfers 176 that should have a million comments people should be
[02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:29.680]  freaking out over what that means and we have what's on the nightly news to break that down
[02:13:30.400 --> 02:13:36.720]  okay good and then report nbc edits video to frame veterans that just went up that is so
[02:13:37.680 --> 02:13:41.680]  incredibly important and you'll be like well i already know that i already know
[02:13:41.680 --> 02:13:46.320]  the liars well your friends and family don't know that and then fort hood gears up for financial
[02:13:46.320 --> 02:13:52.240]  collapse julie wilson has that new report just went up seconds ago as i hit refresh we don't
[02:13:52.240 --> 02:13:56.880]  have automatic refresh on info wars dot com so be sure and refresh yourself by the way tell it i
[02:13:56.880 --> 02:14:01.840]  wanted to automatically refresh every hour i mean that's that's that needs to be done just in case
[02:14:01.840 --> 02:14:05.840]  people you know have it sitting there and forget to refresh it as their homepage is important
[02:14:05.840 --> 02:14:10.080]  because i forget it all the time at home and then i something big breaks uh so let's put a
[02:14:10.080 --> 02:14:18.960]  every one hour refresh on there okay and then moving right along here i wanted to get pharmacist
[02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:25.280]  ben fuchs on about a host of medical issues that are being announced and big developments that
[02:14:25.280 --> 02:14:29.200]  are taking place because he's very informative and from all of my deep research he's one of the
[02:14:29.200 --> 02:14:34.880]  most informed people out there that concurs with the analysis of people like you know doctor group
[02:14:34.880 --> 02:14:41.680]  that comes on the show and mike adams and others and we're going to be discussing um you know different
[02:14:43.200 --> 02:14:49.440]  things with him about that in a moment but i wanted to first bring up a fox news report bpa
[02:14:49.440 --> 02:14:54.720]  could cause miscarriages because for me there's a lot of stuff we can't do about the overall
[02:14:54.720 --> 02:15:00.720]  neural order and things like that but we can start filtering our water we can start trying to eat
[02:15:00.720 --> 02:15:06.080]  less and less gmo and finally get off of it we can start gardening we can start eating health
[02:15:06.080 --> 02:15:12.960]  here we can start mild exercise um or more if you've already started i'm just saying you don't have to
[02:15:12.960 --> 02:15:19.280]  become superman overnight taking care of ourselves is how we defeat the globalists they want to hurt
[02:15:19.280 --> 02:15:24.320]  us they want to dumb us down they're on record so get off the gmo get off the bisphenol a get
[02:15:24.320 --> 02:15:29.840]  off the chemicals the biologicals protect your thyroid with from the radiologicals things like
[02:15:29.840 --> 02:15:34.640]  that but one of the biggest things you can do is bisphenol a when i first learned that they had
[02:15:34.640 --> 02:15:40.080]  deals back in the fifties to pick out a thousands of different combinations of plastic a type that
[02:15:40.080 --> 02:15:45.200]  leached estrogen to feminized men to hyper feminized women giving them breast cancer accelerating
[02:15:45.200 --> 02:15:51.200]  the aging of their breast and other sexual tissues causing these cysts to form very quick
[02:15:51.200 --> 02:15:56.800]  that an 85 year old woman would have said you're 20 and you get them it is chemical warfare john
[02:15:56.800 --> 02:16:02.000]  p holgren talks about it in the eco science written um the year i was born 1974 they're very
[02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:07.360]  proud of what they've done and since i've been talking about it and others have since i learned
[02:16:07.360 --> 02:16:12.160]  of it now mothers are getting it glass for their children people are getting away from it more and
[02:16:12.160 --> 02:16:17.520]  more but still it's in a lot of things and i wanted to just get a few minutes with pharmacist
[02:16:17.520 --> 02:16:22.560]  ben fuchs joining us also syndicated radio host here on the gc and radio network i wanted to get
[02:16:22.560 --> 02:16:28.720]  it his take on this because now it's becoming more and more mainstream but we can't get it banned
[02:16:29.440 --> 02:16:34.800]  when it's it's it's like glyphosate in the water supply which also fries your endocrine systems
[02:16:34.800 --> 02:16:40.640]  on record how bad is this stuff because the studies cnn's also reporting on it the studies
[02:16:40.640 --> 02:16:47.360]  are on record that it is massively increasing multiple fold miscarriages and women by messing
[02:16:47.360 --> 02:16:51.920]  up their hormones a lot of compounding pharmacies as i've heard you talk about and i've heard local
[02:16:51.920 --> 02:16:55.440]  ones talk about it on the radio they will show one of the biggest ones people's pharmacy
[02:16:57.440 --> 02:17:03.440]  the fact that they just now put women on compounded uh herb based hormones so they
[02:17:03.440 --> 02:17:09.200]  don't lose the baby they're just recommending it out of hand because so many women uh are are
[02:17:09.200 --> 02:17:16.560]  basically taking the statistical abortion pill might as well be r u 486 that's really what this
[02:17:16.560 --> 02:17:20.720]  is statistically it's making sure that you know about a third of the women have miscarriages that
[02:17:20.720 --> 02:17:24.960]  shouldn't there's another loving gift from the liberals the trendies so so pharmacist been
[02:17:24.960 --> 02:17:30.640]  fused what can you say to us about bpa and other estrogen mimicers and just how bad this is uh
[02:17:30.640 --> 02:17:36.320]  well you hit the nail on the head actually uh estrogen is the key word and while most folks
[02:17:36.320 --> 02:17:41.520]  know that estrogen is being a feminizing hormone and indeed it is and like you say if feminizes
[02:17:41.520 --> 02:17:46.560]  men and hyper feminizes women that's what breasts are and that's what breast tumors are but even
[02:17:46.560 --> 02:17:54.800]  more importantly estrogen is a for anti fertility substance it shuts down fertility that's what you
[02:17:54.800 --> 02:17:59.280]  take so that you can get pregnant yes it's an element of birth control it's a birth control pill
[02:17:59.280 --> 02:18:05.840]  bisphenol a is birth control it's population control it is it's chemical warfare as you said
[02:18:05.840 --> 02:18:11.360]  and to make matters worse estrogen is a stress hormone it shuts down the immune system it maximizes
[02:18:11.360 --> 02:18:18.640]  the body's it accelerates the body's response to stress it induces cancer it's on the FDA is
[02:18:18.640 --> 02:18:26.240]  known to cause cancer list why would any industrial operation want to put a toxin a well recognized
[02:18:26.240 --> 02:18:31.680]  toxin that suppresses fertility that causes stress that suppresses the immune system that gender
[02:18:31.680 --> 02:18:36.960]  benders that creates like you say feminized men and hyper feminized women why would they ever put
[02:18:36.960 --> 02:18:42.160]  that in some kind of industrially industrially produced and a consumer product well the way I
[02:18:42.160 --> 02:18:48.400]  look at it Alex is it's a clear example of how we are manipulated of how our chemistry
[02:18:48.400 --> 02:18:54.080]  is manipulated for nefarious purposes and so the real revolution is to take control of your
[02:18:54.080 --> 02:18:58.720]  chemistry again and I'm doing that right now you hit them that's exactly what I was about to say
[02:18:58.720 --> 02:19:04.560]  we need to understand how to control our chemistry for example iodine one of the best ways to protect
[02:19:04.560 --> 02:19:09.360]  yourself from cancer one of the best ways to protect yourself from breast cancer and from
[02:19:09.360 --> 02:19:13.760]  breast cysts is to make sure that you got enough iodine iodine is very difficult to find in the
[02:19:13.760 --> 02:19:18.160]  diet and thus the importance of supplemental and I know today I wanted to get you on to talk about
[02:19:18.160 --> 02:19:22.560]  iodine because all the experts are just lining up on the fact that iodine I want to talk about the
[02:19:22.560 --> 02:19:28.000]  best types of iodine nascent versus others I'm going to talk about some of the info wars health
[02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:34.880]  dot com young jevity systems that have wide spectrum iodine's in them because we've sold out of my
[02:19:34.880 --> 02:19:39.280]  survival shield nice and I don't people can back order that then for his life dot com but there
[02:19:39.280 --> 02:19:43.200]  are other naturally occurring ones like in the modifier when we sell an info or store dot com
[02:19:43.200 --> 02:19:47.840]  I don't know about what is available in info wars health dot com because as people figure this out
[02:19:47.840 --> 02:19:53.920]  it's all selling out and then move into other top health news with pharmacist Ben Fuchs when we
[02:19:53.920 --> 02:19:58.320]  come back but we've got to take control of our chemistry that's what we're doing against the
[02:19:58.320 --> 02:20:05.200]  globalist Alex Jones here and I want to tell you about a long time friend of the show my
[02:20:05.200 --> 02:20:11.360]  patriot supply as you might remember this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed

[02:24:14.800 --> 02:24:27.200]  by the way folks if you go to infowarslife.com you can order the nation atomic pure iodine
[02:24:28.960 --> 02:24:34.240]  that doctor group and others you know set up front is the very best and i've been
[02:24:34.240 --> 02:24:41.120]  taking it for two months and just had incredible response but if there are other forms of iodine
[02:24:41.120 --> 02:24:47.040]  pharmacist ben fuchs explained to me why iodine is so important and then also some of the other
[02:24:47.040 --> 02:24:50.640]  minerals and things i'm told you need to take with it to have it actually work properly i've
[02:24:50.640 --> 02:24:57.280]  also been detoxing while i've been on it in ways i've never experienced uh just for me personally
[02:24:57.280 --> 02:25:02.400]  and and doctor groups of this would happen mental clarity energy you name it but i've also been
[02:25:02.400 --> 02:25:09.280]  detoxifying some uh i mean what's the difference between nascent iodine and the other iodines
[02:25:09.280 --> 02:25:15.280]  that are out there nascent iodine is electrified iodine technically is called atomic iodine
[02:25:15.280 --> 02:25:20.320]  minerals are usually complex with other substances or sometimes they're complex with themselves
[02:25:20.320 --> 02:25:25.600]  what makes nascent iodine so neat is the fact that all of the electrical energy is kept on the
[02:25:25.600 --> 02:25:31.200]  iodine atom the the electrical energy is not spread across iodine atoms or across potassium as it is
[02:25:31.200 --> 02:25:35.680]  in lugal solution and some of the other iodine supplements with nascent iodine you get an
[02:25:35.680 --> 02:25:42.720]  electrified iodine atom what that means is the body sucks up nascent iodine really rapidly it
[02:25:42.720 --> 02:25:46.240]  doesn't have to metabolize it or break it down the way it does when you have when you take a
[02:25:46.240 --> 02:25:50.720]  potassium iodide product like lugal solution and lugal solution is still a good form of iodide but
[02:25:50.720 --> 02:25:55.280]  it doesn't even come close to the electrified version the nascent iodine version well the
[02:25:55.280 --> 02:25:59.840]  electrified tastes good compared to the other ones well you're getting electrical activity you're
[02:25:59.840 --> 02:26:06.400]  getting us the lugal solution tastes awful absolutely hideous but with the nascent iodine
[02:26:06.400 --> 02:26:10.880]  you're getting a cleaner form of iodine than you would be getting if you use the lugal solution
[02:26:10.880 --> 02:26:14.960]  but the neatest thing about the nascent iodine is the fact that it's bioavailable and as you know
[02:26:14.960 --> 02:26:20.560]  alex when it comes to nutrition it's not what you're taking it's what your body is using and
[02:26:20.560 --> 02:26:25.280]  with nascent iodine you're maximizing what we call bioavailability and that makes it the most
[02:26:25.280 --> 02:26:29.360]  superior form of iodine now there's other forms of iodine of course we've been talking i've talked
[02:26:29.360 --> 02:26:33.840]  on this program a lot and i talk on my program a lot about lugal solution we've talked in the past
[02:26:33.840 --> 02:26:38.560]  about a product called iodorol there's seaweed there's various ways that you can get iodine but to
[02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:42.560]  make absolutely sure that you're getting this essential mineral in my opinion you should be
[02:26:42.560 --> 02:26:46.560]  using the nascent iodine and you you said something very interesting most people don't realize that
[02:26:46.560 --> 02:26:52.240]  iodine is an important brain element it's important for the developing brain and it's important for
[02:26:52.240 --> 02:26:57.120]  the adult brain as well and so the mental clarity that you get the sense of the mental sense of
[02:26:57.120 --> 02:27:01.360]  well-being that you get it's a very common these are very common benefits of iodine that people
[02:27:01.360 --> 02:27:05.360]  don't talk a lot about and meanwhile when the government actually cared about us they put iodine
[02:27:05.360 --> 02:27:10.400]  in the salt now they take it out and put fluoride in the water the opposite explain what that does
[02:27:10.400 --> 02:27:14.160]  this is all on purpose yeah well that's a very good point you see if you look at the periodic table
[02:27:14.160 --> 02:27:19.520]  you'll find that the periodic table of elements is divided up into columns and all of the columns
[02:27:19.520 --> 02:27:23.840]  all of the substances in each column are related to each other well in the second to last column
[02:27:23.840 --> 02:27:28.160]  this is called the halogen column you've got three elements that are very similar four elements that
[02:27:28.160 --> 02:27:33.040]  are very similar to each other one is iodine another is bromine another is fluoride and another
[02:27:33.040 --> 02:27:38.960]  is chloride and the body gets confused by would rather have iodine but in the if there's no iodine
[02:27:38.960 --> 02:27:44.320]  it's going to take in whatever it can take so in the latin the if there's a lack of iodine under
[02:27:44.320 --> 02:27:48.240]  a circumstance where there's not enough iodine the body's going to take in fluoride the body's
[02:27:48.240 --> 02:27:54.000]  going to take in chloride or chlorine the body's going to take in bromine as well and you end up
[02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:59.040]  with brominosis you end up with fluoride fluoride deposits in the pineal gland you end up with
[02:27:59.040 --> 02:28:05.680]  weaker bone you can end up with chlorine toxicity all of this can be counteracted by supplementing
[02:28:05.680 --> 02:28:09.680]  with iodine and if you don't supplement with iodine if you don't have iodine you're on higher
[02:28:09.680 --> 02:28:15.200]  risks of all of brominosis and toxicity from fluoride as well as from chlorine as well so
[02:28:15.200 --> 02:28:19.200]  if you look at the periodic table that's all you need to know look at the column you'll see iodine
[02:28:19.200 --> 02:28:23.760]  and then you'll see fluoride and then you'll see bromine and then you'll see chlorine three toxins
[02:28:23.760 --> 02:28:29.600]  one nutritional element you want to make sure that's just good for you it's a survival shield
[02:28:29.600 --> 02:28:35.120]  abs not only the survival shield it's anti fluoride it's anti bromine it protects your pineal gland
[02:28:35.120 --> 02:28:38.640]  in addition to all these benefits that we're talking about it protects the most important
[02:28:38.640 --> 02:28:43.920]  gland in the body the pineal gland which regulates everything alex if you want it to destroy a
[02:28:43.920 --> 02:28:49.120]  culture if you want to destroy a civilization if you want to destroy a species you could do no
[02:28:49.120 --> 02:28:54.640]  better job than to target the pineal gland which is exactly what fluoride in the water does not to
[02:28:54.640 --> 02:29:00.480]  mention chlorine in the water not to mention bromine and flour and in in mountain dew and
[02:29:00.480 --> 02:29:06.880]  soda pop and in plastics etc we have created this environment where we are immersed saturated in
[02:29:06.880 --> 02:29:11.600]  toxicity and then what's crazy is we do a lot of bad stuff on our own but the establishment is
[02:29:11.600 --> 02:29:16.480]  actually doing a lot of this on purpose to politically control us and then you research them
[02:29:16.480 --> 02:29:19.920]  whether it's the communist chinese leaders or the european leaders or the u.s leaders
[02:29:19.920 --> 02:29:23.840]  they're all obsessed with everything you're saying pharmacist ben fuchs they're all on the

[02:34:23.200 --> 02:34:30.560]  i use the young javid products infowars health.com i would with a doctor group went out and found the
[02:34:30.560 --> 02:34:37.920]  very best nascent iodine for survival shield at infowarslife.com that's what we do here but but
[02:34:37.920 --> 02:34:43.920]  separately like any iodine is as you know that i guess is in the salt you can still buy where they
[02:34:43.920 --> 02:34:48.320]  add it but they don't put it in there i guess by law now i would guess from pharmacist fuchs is
[02:34:48.320 --> 02:34:55.440]  better than the other three things on the periodic table that we know are bad like the chloride and
[02:34:55.440 --> 02:35:02.240]  the fluoride and the rest of it going in and filling these organs in these glands that need the thyroid
[02:35:03.520 --> 02:35:08.400]  you know to operate and need it to have iodine to do that but you're the expert pharmacist ben
[02:35:08.400 --> 02:35:14.960]  fuchs brightsideben.com uh is of course your syndicated radio show website brightsideben.com
[02:35:14.960 --> 02:35:21.600]  continue to get into uh you know really the key here why iodine well i mean answer my question
[02:35:21.600 --> 02:35:27.040]  if people can't get our super nascent iodine uh if people and the other stuff out i try to find
[02:35:27.040 --> 02:35:30.240]  others to believe me to fill the orders it's just no good i can't sell it i don't think it's real
[02:35:30.240 --> 02:35:34.560]  nascent iodine i'm sorry it tastes like rocket fuel this stuff tastes great and no one else seems
[02:35:34.560 --> 02:35:39.600]  to have it it's like it's like a lost art i'm told so where do people else get this naturally i mean
[02:35:39.600 --> 02:35:45.280]  i'm told that the uh certain types of seaweed that are in the ancient legacy oceans that that that they
[02:35:45.280 --> 02:35:50.480]  do uptake and then metabolize and have the good iodine explain to me what type this is and and
[02:35:50.480 --> 02:35:54.880]  where people can get it if they can't get nascent iodine well the big problem with iodine alexis
[02:35:54.880 --> 02:35:59.840]  it's not a terrestrial mineral it's an ocean mineral so the sources of iodine the best sources
[02:35:59.840 --> 02:36:07.280]  of iodine are ocean products seaweed and seafood but of course we know that uh seafood has got
[02:36:07.280 --> 02:36:12.560]  the mercury in it so you got to be a little bit careful but seaweed has a really neat property
[02:36:12.560 --> 02:36:19.120]  in that it has a it can purify toxins so when you eat seaweed products ocean vegetation products
[02:36:19.120 --> 02:36:25.040]  use seaweed supplements you get a minimal amount of toxicity and you get a good amount of iodine
[02:36:25.040 --> 02:36:31.040]  and i've been talking about eating seaweed for a long time in addition uh Celtic sea salt and ocean
[02:36:31.040 --> 02:36:36.480]  salts tend to be better sources of iodine than iodine salt you know the iodine form of iodine
[02:36:36.480 --> 02:36:40.480]  they put an iodine salt it's not an absorbable form and then you've got to deal with excipients
[02:36:40.480 --> 02:36:44.960]  and flow agents and all of the other things they put in into the salt the non-nutritional substances
[02:36:44.960 --> 02:36:49.600]  that they put into salt if you use something like okay so let's be specific when you go to the store
[02:36:49.600 --> 02:36:53.600]  you want organic people say well salt can be organic anyway so now it can actually be mixed
[02:36:53.600 --> 02:36:58.800]  with things that aren't organic well what type do you need Celtic sea salt or Himalayan salt
[02:36:58.800 --> 02:37:03.040]  there's actually hundreds of different gourmet salts but look for Celtic sea salt and look for
[02:37:03.680 --> 02:37:08.160]  a look for Himalayan salt here's something neat about salt uh it's kind of similar to uh
[02:37:08.160 --> 02:37:11.600]  some of the benefits that you get with iodine iodine is also very important for the body stress
[02:37:11.600 --> 02:37:16.000]  gland the adrenal glands in fact all salt is important for the adrenal glands and one of the
[02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:22.320]  reasons why we crave salt so much is because our adrenal glands are fried because we're under so
[02:37:22.320 --> 02:37:26.800]  much stress so when you're under a lot of stress you're going to find yourself craving salt and
[02:37:26.800 --> 02:37:31.920]  what does the doctor tell you stay away from salt watch your salt intake so people are on these low
[02:37:31.920 --> 02:37:38.240]  salt diets that not only exacerbates problems with stress it not only reduces the body stress
[02:37:38.240 --> 02:37:44.320]  response but it induces these terrible salt cravings that everybody has I mean you cannot go without
[02:37:44.320 --> 02:37:48.320]  salt you may try to if your doctor tells you but you're going to find yourself gravitating
[02:37:48.320 --> 02:37:54.640]  towards salty foods so what you do is you act preemptively you get yourself some Celtic sea
[02:37:54.640 --> 02:37:59.840]  salt or some Himalayan salt or even any good mineral product that can help provide some salt
[02:37:59.840 --> 02:38:05.280]  some salts for the adrenal glands and you drink salt water and you don't drink a lot of it you
[02:38:05.280 --> 02:38:10.480]  just drink just enough until your salt cravings disappear and what you'll find is you have better
[02:38:10.480 --> 02:38:16.480]  adrenal gland functioning which means more energy which means a better response ability to respond
[02:38:16.480 --> 02:38:23.040]  to stress and it also means the manufacturing of fertility and anti-aging and growth hormones
[02:38:23.040 --> 02:38:28.480]  these are the kinds of strategies that the medical model is promoting that shut down our ability to
[02:38:28.480 --> 02:38:33.920]  thrive almost everything you hear from the mainstream medical model is almost intentionally
[02:38:33.920 --> 02:38:37.120]  designed to keep us from thriving I was about to say you know I've been doing research the last
[02:38:37.120 --> 02:38:41.200]  few years trying to get back in shape from being totally unhealthy from years and it's not caring
[02:38:41.200 --> 02:38:46.080]  about myself and figuring they'd kill me anyway so while I bother I've been busy you know trying
[02:38:46.080 --> 02:38:51.040]  to lose 40 50 pounds lost most of it to get back in shape it's well it's really hard to get back
[02:38:51.040 --> 02:38:55.360]  in shape once you've gotten out of it and I talked to you and so many other experts and I said well
[02:38:55.360 --> 02:39:00.480]  what's a what's an herb what's a vitamin what's a mineral that says natural growth hormone or will
[02:39:00.480 --> 02:39:06.000]  boost my natural testosterone to help me exercise more and you said iodine iodine it will then
[02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:10.320]  regulate the thyroid other glands and allow you to release the stuff you need and indeed that's
[02:39:10.320 --> 02:39:16.480]  happened my problem is I'm not even lifting weights uh except for once a week really light reps
[02:39:16.480 --> 02:39:22.720]  I'm trying to get small not big and instead I've lost some weight but with my clothes off I mean
[02:39:22.720 --> 02:39:27.120]  you know it looks like I'm trying to be a bodybuilder or something that's not what I want so what do I
[02:39:27.120 --> 02:39:32.560]  need to do pharmacist Ben Fuchs because I do still eat like a pig I guess yeah you can't help getting
[02:39:32.560 --> 02:39:36.480]  ripped that's gonna happen Alex you're just gonna have to wear long sleeved shirts buddy because
[02:39:36.480 --> 02:39:40.640]  once your body once you start to lose body fat and once you start to replace that body fat with
[02:39:40.640 --> 02:39:44.720]  muscle mass you're just gonna get ripped you know that's just one of the things that happens and as
[02:39:44.720 --> 02:39:49.040]  you say the thought the iodine regulates the thyroid yeah but I'm telling you this iodine is
[02:39:49.040 --> 02:39:53.920]  like anabolic steroids or something I mean I'm literally turning into a gorilla it's and I go
[02:39:53.920 --> 02:39:58.800]  in with weights now and it's just like it's unbelievable like I'm 18 you're fueling your
[02:39:58.800 --> 02:40:03.360]  thyroid your thyroid next to your pituitary or your pineal gland your thyroid maybe the most
[02:40:03.360 --> 02:40:08.640]  important gland in your body it regulates every single cell in the body and by the way we're talking
[02:40:08.640 --> 02:40:12.480]  about the adrenal glands there's a very important link between the adrenal glands and the thyroid
[02:40:12.480 --> 02:40:17.040]  once your adrenal glands are stressed out once you're maxing out with adrenal hormones and your
[02:40:17.040 --> 02:40:21.040]  adrenal glands are trying to deal with your stressed out life over time the thyroid will
[02:40:21.040 --> 02:40:26.560]  gradually slow down and this is one of the reasons why stress makes you gain weight this is one of
[02:40:26.560 --> 02:40:31.040]  the reasons why hypothyroidism is such an epidemic and making sure that you're getting enough iodine
[02:40:31.040 --> 02:40:36.960]  and by the way selenium and iodine work together to help fuel the thyroid this is one of the reasons
[02:40:36.960 --> 02:40:40.800]  why once you start taking in these supplements that help the thyroid you'll lose weight you'll
[02:40:40.800 --> 02:40:44.560]  gain more muscle mass not to mention the fact that you're going to feel better and have more energy
[02:40:44.560 --> 02:40:49.840]  as well and by the way there's something called fluoride fatigue which is a which is caused by
[02:40:49.840 --> 02:40:55.600]  excess ingestion of fluoride affecting the thyroid and causing hypothyroidism in a sluggishness once
[02:40:55.600 --> 02:41:01.600]  you get in once you start taking in taking in iodine your bodies will start to absorb less fluoride
[02:41:01.600 --> 02:41:06.000]  and once again you'll have better thyroid functioning and you'll have more muscle mass more
[02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:13.600]  energy better better immunity more clarity of thinking as well as weight loss simply incredible
[02:41:13.600 --> 02:41:19.360]  and and again this power structure knows this i mean being a pharmacist being a successful
[02:41:19.360 --> 02:41:23.760]  compounding pharmacist a guy that has natural lines a cosmetics you name it you don't brag about
[02:41:23.760 --> 02:41:28.640]  yourself but you're very successful really smart guy i mean interviewing you the last four or five
[02:41:28.640 --> 02:41:33.120]  years uh i know more and more you've researched the political more and i've sent you documents where
[02:41:33.120 --> 02:41:38.880]  they admit all this stuff but this is a conscious program putting the best phenol a in removing
[02:41:38.880 --> 02:41:44.240]  even the you know the junkie iodine putting in the fluoride putting the fluoride in as an additive
[02:41:44.240 --> 02:41:50.160]  to most of the processed foods it levels thousands of times above the water uh level i mean i mean
[02:41:50.160 --> 02:41:54.720]  this is murdering people alex you know as well as i know who are the first people to put fluoride
[02:41:54.720 --> 02:41:58.640]  in the water who are the first what was the first country that to start using fluoride the communist
[02:41:58.640 --> 02:42:03.120]  russians and the nazis right exactly and this is the kind of stuff that we're putting in our
[02:42:03.120 --> 02:42:07.440]  water here in this country that are you can actually go to the drugstore and get fluoridated
[02:42:07.440 --> 02:42:12.960]  water for your baby nursing water they call it where you drown your baby's brain in fluoride
[02:42:12.960 --> 02:42:17.600]  as if it's not they can't wait until we're adults and we're drinking tap water now you can fluoridate
[02:42:17.600 --> 02:42:23.440]  your baby and by the way as the prescription drug fluoride is limited to 2.2 milligram doses
[02:42:23.440 --> 02:42:28.320]  daily doses you get far more than that if you drink half a gallon of water a gallon of water
[02:42:28.320 --> 02:42:32.880]  oh yeah we're being forcibly medicated and the water is nothing they sprayed on the crops is
[02:42:32.880 --> 02:42:36.560]  is one of the main pesticides that's another one and due to lawsuits last year they announced
[02:42:36.560 --> 02:42:44.320]  they're phasing it out as an illegal pesticide by 2014 you're getting when you when you eat vegetables
[02:42:44.320 --> 02:42:50.320]  that veg the vegetables are saturated and fluoride fluoridated water tap water not to mention all the
[02:42:50.320 --> 02:42:54.480]  other crap that's in the tap water so you can't even eat vegetables safely even by the way organic
[02:42:54.480 --> 02:43:00.400]  vegetables can have this but nation iodine blocks it that's right that's right that's i could you
[02:43:00.400 --> 02:43:05.520]  know there is so many reasons to get on this nason iodine as a supplement as a daily supplement
[02:43:05.520 --> 02:43:11.120]  every single day from from protection from bromine and chlorine and fluoride to protection
[02:43:11.120 --> 02:43:16.160]  for the thyroid to protection for the various glands what do i take it with again selenium selenium
[02:43:16.160 --> 02:43:20.000]  and iodine work together especially for the thyroid you and that's one that dr wallott's been
[02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:24.880]  talking about for many many years selenium is a super super incredibly important mineral and one
[02:43:24.880 --> 02:43:28.800]  that many of us are deficient in support for protection from cancer important for protection
[02:43:28.800 --> 02:43:33.920]  from from heart disease it's important product a component of something called glutathione
[02:43:33.920 --> 02:43:38.880]  which is your body's major cancer fighter selenium has got so many wonderful benefits it's active in
[02:43:38.880 --> 02:43:43.280]  very very small amounts and even being active in small amounts many people are deficient in
[02:43:43.280 --> 02:43:47.680]  selenium always take iodine and selenium together they work together for the thyroid by the way i
[02:43:47.680 --> 02:43:52.480]  had some of my friend's family over sunday night for a dinner party and i didn't know that they'd
[02:43:52.480 --> 02:44:00.080]  signed up under m4's team dot com or members at m4's health dot com for for two years and i mean
[02:44:00.080 --> 02:44:04.000]  this is a true story and they said they'd come on the show and they're sitting there my wife made
[02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:11.360]  dinner wait and they go listen my wife couldn't even get out of bed with uh the uh arthritis she
[02:44:11.360 --> 02:44:16.960]  was having rheumatoid arthritis and that she got on the beyond tangy tangerine and the alex pack in
[02:44:16.960 --> 02:44:24.560]  the and the uh fx system and the joint things that dr wallock recommended at m4's health
[02:44:24.560 --> 02:44:31.360]  and that within six months it was almost all gone and now it's gone it's gone now she doesn't have
[02:44:31.360 --> 02:44:37.280]  the arthritis anymore and her hands were even giant swole up and now that's almost all gone away
[02:44:37.280 --> 02:44:43.760]  and again it's just incredible that that this is more people telling me this and saying this is
[02:44:43.760 --> 02:44:49.200]  incredible and i mean i know it's good for you but i can't believe how good just basic stuff is
[02:44:49.200 --> 02:44:53.680]  yeah it's incredible and you know i'm a pharmacist and i i'm very careful about the things i recommend
[02:44:53.680 --> 02:44:58.480]  and the things that i promote and i'm telling you alex when i see the kind of responses the people
[02:44:58.480 --> 02:45:01.920]  get when they start a nutritional supplement program they get on the beyond tangy tangerine
[02:45:01.920 --> 02:45:07.040]  they get on some of these things that we talk about on the program it blows me away and i can't
[02:45:07.040 --> 02:45:12.800]  shut my mouth it's not it would not be fair of me as a healthcare professional to not tell people
[02:45:12.800 --> 02:45:16.480]  about the benefits of these things to not tell people about the beyond tangy tangerine and i don't
[02:45:16.480 --> 02:45:20.480]  like being a salesperson i don't feel comfortable being a salesperson i'm a healthcare professional
[02:45:20.480 --> 02:45:26.320]  but as a healthcare professional i have a sacred duty to tell people about things that i see work
[02:45:26.320 --> 02:45:31.600]  and that i know work and that have a a theoretical basis as well as a clinical basis for working
[02:45:31.600 --> 02:45:35.440]  and so when i talk about the beyond tangy tangerine or nason iodine or selenium or the young
[02:45:35.440 --> 02:45:41.280]  javity products i'm telling you this because i know the stuff works and has panacea and incredible
[02:45:41.280 --> 02:45:46.480]  sounding as it is it is a panacea and it is incredible and i say on my radio show every day
[02:45:46.480 --> 02:45:52.400]  you're gonna think it's a miracle but it's not a miracle it's just the way the body works now now
[02:45:52.400 --> 02:45:56.640]  now now what about the the nason iodine detox i've been on about a month and a half or so and
[02:45:56.640 --> 02:46:02.880]  was just so much energy super aggressive losing weight still eating like a pig all the stuff but
[02:46:02.880 --> 02:46:06.480]  then about the last week i still have a lot of energy but i am noticing i want to go into what
[02:46:06.480 --> 02:46:11.920]  a detox is like but you know there's different ways to detox your skin other ways i'm really
[02:46:11.920 --> 02:46:17.840]  detoxing now and dr uh group was saying maybe i want to slow down i mean i'm taking the recommended
[02:46:17.840 --> 02:46:23.040]  dose uh you know that the establishment recommends but but maybe i should slow down for a while because
[02:46:23.040 --> 02:46:27.600]  it does feel like i have a hangover sometimes in the morning now make sure you're doing other
[02:46:27.600 --> 02:46:31.920]  nutrients that support detox and one of the most important nutrients isn't really a nutrient at all
[02:46:31.920 --> 02:46:37.040]  but it's water drinking more water will help you flush out toxicity also there's a very important
[02:46:37.040 --> 02:46:42.880]  relationship between vitamin c and iodine vitamin vitamin c can help you retain iodine much more
[02:46:42.880 --> 02:46:46.960]  effectively and vitamin c has some wonderful detox properties as well and this is one of the
[02:46:46.960 --> 02:46:50.480]  neat reasons this is one of the most important reasons and the neatest things about getting on a
[02:46:50.480 --> 02:46:56.720]  supplement program alex to a well-balanced program all the individual nutrients have very interesting
[02:46:56.720 --> 02:47:01.920]  properties iodine for the thyroid and vitamin c for immunity and selenium for the heart and for
[02:47:01.920 --> 02:47:07.120]  making glutathione but what you really want to focus on is getting on an entire program a well
[02:47:07.120 --> 02:47:11.840]  balanced program that provides you with all 90 essential nutrients each one has its own and that's
[02:47:11.840 --> 02:47:17.760]  why beyond genitangerine 2.0 organic is so important because it's all right there exactly and then you
[02:47:17.760 --> 02:47:23.920]  can supplement on top of that so so obviously i forgot i need to take selenium now now what do
[02:47:23.920 --> 02:47:30.000]  i do if from fluoride most of my life until i woke up to it has has has kind of calcified in my
[02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:37.120]  thyroid in my pineal is it true that nascent iodine long term if it's the proper type uh can actually
[02:47:37.120 --> 02:47:42.800]  help you begin to actually slough some of that out absolutely once your body gets the good stuff alex
[02:47:42.800 --> 02:47:47.520]  it doesn't take the bad stuff it loses the bad stuff once you start taking iodine the fluoride
[02:47:47.520 --> 02:47:53.200]  will drop off the bromine will drop off the calcium which is is in response to the to the
[02:47:53.200 --> 02:47:58.720]  fluoride will start to drop off as well you can also use other uh uh a chelating nutrients vitamin
[02:47:58.720 --> 02:48:02.640]  c chelating means magnetically attract and there's nutrients that will magnetically attract
[02:48:02.640 --> 02:48:07.040]  fluoride out of your body selenium is a wonderful chelating agent that can magnetically attract
[02:48:07.040 --> 02:48:13.520]  fluoride out of your body vitamin c is tremendously chelating it can uh help attract uh help attract
[02:48:13.520 --> 02:48:18.960]  a fluoride out of your body there's something called n acetyl cysteine nac which is tremendously
[02:48:18.960 --> 02:48:23.600]  maybe the most important chelating agent you could ever use you can use n acetyl cysteine by the way
[02:48:23.600 --> 02:48:27.680]  n acetyl cysteine is great for hangovers it's great for any toxicity in the body you can use that on
[02:48:27.680 --> 02:48:32.800]  a regular basis sulfur has got some tremendous chelating properties things like msm sulfur and
[02:48:32.800 --> 02:48:37.760]  you can of course find sulfur in in in fresh vegetables uh and fresh fruits and vegetables
[02:48:37.760 --> 02:48:41.440]  there's you you want to make sure you're pounding your body with these chelating agents as well as
[02:48:41.440 --> 02:48:46.640]  antioxidants vitamin e by the way works together with selenium and vitamin a and something called
[02:48:46.640 --> 02:48:51.520]  alpha and vitamin uh vitamin c vitamin c vitamin e and selenium all work together as well as
[02:48:51.520 --> 02:48:55.920]  something called alpha lipoic acid which you don't hear very much about you don't hear hardly
[02:48:55.920 --> 02:49:00.720]  anything about alpha lipoic acid but it's got some tremendous chelating properties so pound
[02:49:00.720 --> 02:49:04.480]  yourself with these chelating agents you'll magnetically pull that fluoride out of your body
[02:49:04.480 --> 02:49:09.040]  and you'll support the work that the iodine is doing to dump fluoride off of the pineal
[02:49:09.040 --> 02:49:13.280]  literally things like nascent iodine from what i've heard from others they go around electrically
[02:49:13.280 --> 02:49:17.840]  charged and grab the fluoride and things and drag it out of your body it's all about the electricity
[02:49:17.840 --> 02:49:24.080]  alex nascent iodine is electrified iodine and anytime you electrify a nutrient you improve
[02:49:24.080 --> 02:49:31.360]  the body's ability to utilize it incredible i want to come back and ask you about politics and what's
[02:49:31.360 --> 02:49:35.360]  happening in the world i want to start getting into that after the break but look at this iodine
[02:49:35.360 --> 02:49:40.160]  deficiency during pregnancy may adversely affect children's mental development and that's out of
[02:49:40.160 --> 02:49:45.520]  the medical press and then they link through to a new study on that but i mean that was in the
[02:49:45.520 --> 02:49:50.880]  Lancet medical journal i mean they've known this forever i read about a hundred years ago in england
[02:49:50.880 --> 02:49:54.880]  where they were saying kids had low IQ from not enough iodine that's why they're putting it in
[02:49:54.880 --> 02:49:59.840]  the salt i mean they're always acting like they just discovered this they were using nascent iodine
[02:49:59.840 --> 02:50:03.360]  a hundred years ago or close to a hundred years ago we've known about the importance of nascent
[02:50:03.360 --> 02:50:08.800]  iodine as well you guys are right on top of it alex that whole nascent iodine thing you are
[02:50:08.800 --> 02:50:12.560]  right on top of it and and jumping on nascent iodine is one of the smartest things you could do
[02:50:13.680 --> 02:50:18.480]  well no i mean you're the one told me get on nascent iodine i was six months a year ago i
[02:50:18.480 --> 02:50:23.520]  remember i called you up and i said what is a good supplement you know to naturally give more
[02:50:23.520 --> 02:50:28.480]  energy and and boost my thyroid and you said nascent iodine and then i tried a bunch they
[02:50:28.480 --> 02:50:33.200]  so horrible tasting and didn't do anything and then i ran into dr group and man this stuff's
[02:50:33.200 --> 02:50:40.320]  unbelievable the problem is we can't make enough of it so but i've got mine and that's what matters
[02:50:41.040 --> 02:50:44.800]  we'll be right back my friend i want to get into the politics the shutdown that now supposedly
[02:50:44.800 --> 02:50:48.800]  ended today and so much more but folks we want to get it back ordered it comes in about two weeks
[02:50:48.800 --> 02:50:54.160]  there's be three weeks out survival shield nascent iodine info wars life and i dare you try

[02:55:37.120 --> 02:55:42.000]  work in 18 hours a day many days and i couldn't have done this without pharmacist ben fuchs advising
[02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:46.800]  me the last four years uh with people like dr group people like mike adams the health ranger
[02:55:47.680 --> 02:55:52.160]  and it's just it is exciting because if i didn't know this when i was young before i tore myself
[02:55:52.160 --> 02:55:57.280]  up and ate like a pig and drank and you know did all the stuff i did for 12 years i mean it was just
[02:55:57.280 --> 02:56:01.040]  amazing if i'd have known this when i was playing football it was in great shape i mean this stuff
[02:56:01.040 --> 02:56:06.880]  is dynamic but i didn't mean to go off into a rant about health stuff let me ask ben your
[02:56:06.880 --> 02:56:11.920]  smart guy business owner in your own right big compounding pharmacy in colorata what do you
[02:56:11.920 --> 02:56:18.880]  make of obama care the shutdown uh all the preparations for urban warfare i mean i think
[02:56:18.880 --> 02:56:22.800]  they're purposely trying to wreck the country what do you think's happening they want to
[02:56:22.800 --> 02:56:27.920]  scared alex they want us running they want us to be chicken little the fact of the matter is
[02:56:27.920 --> 02:56:32.160]  is that you don't do your best work when you're scared you cannot heal you cannot grow you cannot
[02:56:32.160 --> 02:56:37.200]  thrive your brain shrinks when you're in fear that's what they're looking for is to have people
[02:56:37.200 --> 02:56:42.240]  freaked out and that's why it's so important to take control of your life alex the last thing
[02:56:42.240 --> 02:56:46.960]  you ever want to have to do is go to an obama care doctor even doctors will tell you that even
[02:56:46.960 --> 02:56:50.880]  doctors are going to tell you that you don't want to go to an obama care physician once we have
[02:56:50.880 --> 02:56:56.000]  government mandated in uh medical care where the government works off a formulary and you
[02:56:56.000 --> 02:57:02.320]  pick your uh there's a menu of of treatments or a menu of pharmaceuticals it's all over
[02:57:02.320 --> 02:57:08.640]  then they have complete control over your body and this is why it's so important to be proactive
[02:57:08.640 --> 02:57:14.320]  to get yourself on a supplement program to learn how to hack into your appetite your appetite uh
[02:57:14.320 --> 02:57:21.840]  your cravings for foods use salt use oils use protein all of these will allow you to wean
[02:57:21.840 --> 02:57:27.760]  yourself off of the corporate swill the last thing you ever want to do is participate in
[02:57:27.760 --> 02:57:33.760]  government mandated health care or to eat corporate inspired food and the best way to protect yourself
[02:57:33.760 --> 02:57:37.280]  from all this alex the way i look at it is to number one make sure you're getting on a good
[02:57:37.280 --> 02:57:42.800]  nutritional supplement program and number two take control of your mind take control of your
[02:57:42.800 --> 02:57:48.720]  emotions and your feelings don't buy into the the the fear tactics of government shutdown and
[02:57:48.720 --> 02:57:53.520]  all the things that they want you to think don't buy into it get yourself on a good nutritional

[03:01:06.080 --> 03:01:11.440]  gears though back to ben fuchs um and what we're just talking about pharmacist ben fuchs
[03:01:11.440 --> 03:01:15.600]  bright side ben he's got an hour long show every day getting picked up by a lot of stations right

[03:01:21.200 --> 03:01:24.800]  been i'm pretty shook up right now this banking thing but again this is something we could take
[03:01:24.800 --> 03:01:32.160]  control of for now the problem is under the the the big pharma as you know writing and i've been
[03:01:32.160 --> 03:01:37.040]  actually watching i got addicted to this i probably watched let's not exaggerate 30 hours of codex
[03:01:37.040 --> 03:01:41.600]  elementarius voting and meetings going back about six seven years on the internet that i've seen
[03:01:41.600 --> 03:01:47.520]  from the u n and i didn't know it's actually it is big pharma and they want it banned where you
[03:01:47.520 --> 03:01:52.240]  can't even buy uh vitamin c in a bottle i thought it was just lowered it down like some european
[03:01:52.240 --> 03:01:57.520]  countries have done to nothing they really are very close people don't know this to like not even
[03:01:57.520 --> 03:02:02.720]  letting you get vitamin d in mass i mean these people are out of control why do you think alex
[03:02:02.720 --> 03:02:06.800]  why do you think they're so hell bent on keeping people from having vitamins you know when you
[03:02:06.800 --> 03:02:13.120]  come right down to it out we are vitamins we are minerals we are protein and carbohydrates
[03:02:13.120 --> 03:02:17.760]  and fat and they want to sell all their artificial garbage that's toxic they don't want us having
[03:02:17.760 --> 03:02:22.640]  what we are they want to poison the environment poison the water poison the food and then deprive
[03:02:22.640 --> 03:02:27.600]  us of what we need to protect us from the poison you know it's like a one-two punch and i'm telling
[03:02:27.600 --> 03:02:32.320]  you alex as long as we have the ability to buy nutrients this is this is something people want
[03:02:32.320 --> 03:02:36.320]  to take advantage of whatever kind of supplements you want you want to start taking advantage of
[03:02:36.320 --> 03:02:41.920]  this right away you want to start taking advantages of this today get yourself on a supplement program
[03:02:41.920 --> 03:02:47.360]  start to use macro nutrition meaning protein and essential fatty acids and making sure you're
[03:02:47.360 --> 03:02:51.840]  staying away from corporate swell making sure you're restricting your intake of refined foods
[03:02:51.840 --> 03:02:56.560]  and refined carbohydrates you know these are things that we can do today and these are things we
[03:02:56.560 --> 03:03:01.680]  should be doing today and the upside of all of this alex is you're gonna feel better you're gonna
[03:03:01.680 --> 03:03:06.160]  be more resistant to disease you're gonna be more resistant to the poison that's in the water and
[03:03:06.160 --> 03:03:10.480]  in the atmosphere in the environment and you know what else it's a friggin no-brainer i don't know
[03:03:10.480 --> 03:03:15.440]  what i i don't know what kind of downside people can see to getting on a good solid nutritional
[03:03:15.440 --> 03:03:19.360]  supplement program protecting themselves from these kinds of toxins and toxicity that's in our
[03:03:19.360 --> 03:03:24.160]  environment you said it well if folks can't get the high quality nascent iodine in for us live
[03:03:24.160 --> 03:03:28.480]  dot com and they can pre-order it we sold out more is coming in a few weeks it's like three weeks
[03:03:28.480 --> 03:03:33.760]  out if we ship it to people um you know victims of our own success but it really is amazing
[03:03:33.760 --> 03:03:37.760]  the amount of phylin i got a lot of energy out of that nothing compared obviously to the uh
[03:03:38.320 --> 03:03:44.240]  to the nascent iodine the proper type uh there's obviously the m4s health type put out by
[03:03:44.240 --> 03:03:49.440]  longevity that's a wide spectrum of sea plants ancient legacy i'm told is pretty powerful what
[03:03:49.440 --> 03:03:54.720]  else would you find over at m4s health dot com uh probably most important to be on tangy tangerine
[03:03:54.720 --> 03:03:58.720]  the essential fatty acids the ultimate efa's the digestive enzyme you know we can talk about the
[03:03:58.720 --> 03:04:03.360]  importance of digestive enzymes for protecting your body from bisphenol A one of the best ways
[03:04:03.360 --> 03:04:07.520]  that you can protect yourself from toxicity and plastics and in the environment is to improve
[03:04:07.520 --> 03:04:13.200]  your body's ability to clear these toxicity these toxins out and one of the most important strategies
[03:04:13.200 --> 03:04:18.800]  for clearing out toxins is bile the ile bile that stuff that's made in the liver that nobody ever
[03:04:18.800 --> 03:04:24.640]  talks about is one of the most important detoxifying substances in your body and you get the precursors
[03:04:24.640 --> 03:04:30.080]  to bile in the ultimate enzymes from young jevity very underappreciated product and i was also
[03:04:30.080 --> 03:04:35.120]  reading tell me if i'm interpreted this wrong that the the the liver also almost vomits out
[03:04:35.120 --> 03:04:40.400]  its toxins in the bile to be flushed out that's exactly right in keeping your liver taking care
[03:04:40.400 --> 03:04:44.880]  of your liver is also very important by the way bisphenol A is almost specific for toxin out the
[03:04:44.880 --> 03:04:52.160]  liver it's incredible all right right side ben folks will be tuning in i know tomorrow 10 a.m
