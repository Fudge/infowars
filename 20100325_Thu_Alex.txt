[00:38.200 --> 00:46.320]  second hour Judge Andrew Napolitano will be joining us for a full hour to talk
[00:46.320 --> 00:49.680]  about the health care bill to discuss how the Democrats are trying to act like
[00:49.680 --> 00:55.480]  they're victims from a few bricks being thrown through windows trying to spin
[00:55.480 --> 00:58.680]  this whole thing like anyone that's against the health care bill is a
[00:58.680 --> 01:02.720]  racist Nazi which has nothing to do with it we'll be talking to Judge Andrew
[01:02.720 --> 01:07.560]  Napolitano about that and his new book lies the government told you myth power
[01:07.560 --> 01:13.000]  and deception in American history also I talked to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts the
[01:13.000 --> 01:18.640]  father of Reaganomics the head of policy for Ronald Reagan of the Treasury best
[01:18.640 --> 01:22.800]  selling author syndicated columnist he writes two columns a week he is
[01:22.800 --> 01:29.040]  quitting the column there was not much ambiguity in his final column that he
[01:29.040 --> 01:35.480]  sent to us and asked us to post at info wars.com and prisonplanet.com but some
[01:35.480 --> 01:41.480]  people were still questioning exactly what he meant by a goodbye I'm done but
[01:41.480 --> 01:47.400]  I talked to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts yesterday and later in the broadcast I
[01:47.400 --> 01:50.360]  will tell you what he had to say he said that he will probably come on our show
[01:50.360 --> 01:57.800]  first late next week but that he is moving right now and I could hear people
[01:57.800 --> 02:02.920]  boxing up things in the background but he said as soon as he gets moved he will
[02:02.920 --> 02:10.640]  come on this show first Dr. Paul Craig Roberts okay the news is so off the
[02:10.640 --> 02:15.560]  charts as usual things just get crazier and crazier by the day I mean
[02:15.560 --> 02:18.840]  everything we warned you about is coming true because we're reading government
[02:18.840 --> 02:23.960]  documents but it's all here and the news is so important that I'm not just
[02:23.960 --> 02:28.200]  going to start ranting into it at the very beginning of the broadcast I thought
[02:28.200 --> 02:31.760]  we do things a little bit different today I want to open the phones up but
[02:31.760 --> 02:40.240]  only for doctors and nurses to get their take on the government takeover of
[02:40.240 --> 02:43.200]  healthcare if you think it's a good thing like to know you've actually read
[02:43.200 --> 02:46.720]  the bill you think it's a bad thing and you've read the bill or looked at the
[02:46.720 --> 02:52.480]  sections we'd like to hear from you and I will go directly to your calls in the
[02:52.480 --> 03:06.640]  next segment 1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 for doctors and nurses we
[03:06.640 --> 03:09.760]  can also have people who work in VA hospitals call in to talk about the type
[03:09.760 --> 03:14.280]  of care the government provides most of it goes to bureaucracy they don't give
[03:14.280 --> 03:19.640]  the VA actual doctors and medical workers the money they need the entire VA is
[03:19.640 --> 03:24.120]  set up around not delivering treatment and trying to get our veterans into the
[03:24.120 --> 03:31.840]  psychiatric system so they can lose their second amendment rights 1-800-259-9231
[03:31.840 --> 03:38.960]  now in the second third and fourth hour we'll have wide open phones I don't even
[03:38.960 --> 03:43.720]  know what to say anymore it's a 2700 page bill it's back in the Senate oh
[03:43.720 --> 03:47.160]  Obama signed it but now they've got it basically a new bill they're trying to
[03:47.160 --> 03:53.720]  tack even more horrible things on to it and then we've got this story up on

[08:32.000 --> 08:38.360]  for a full hour coming up in the next hour at the very start of the broadcast
[08:38.360 --> 08:42.800]  today I want to go to your phone calls I want to hear from doctors and nurses
[08:42.800 --> 08:50.560]  and medical workers who are aware of the dangerous provisions in this bill this
[08:50.560 --> 08:57.560]  freedom killing constitution overthrowing legislation I talked to my dad last
[08:57.560 --> 09:02.200]  night he was listening to Rush Limbaugh yesterday and he said that Rush Limbaugh
[09:02.200 --> 09:09.200]  was saying that Obama may suspend elections in fact I forgot to tell my
[09:09.200 --> 09:13.800]  crew go to Limbaugh's site his transcript from yesterday because my dad a
[09:13.800 --> 09:17.160]  few weeks ago said that Limbaugh was saying the whole Constitution and Bill
[09:17.160 --> 09:21.280]  of Rights was being overthrown and then we went to his site indeed he had said
[09:21.280 --> 09:26.360]  that so I know he said it because my dad said he heard it but that's a big deal
[09:26.360 --> 09:31.960]  to have Limbaugh coming out saying we may have martial law in America and that
[09:31.960 --> 09:36.760]  this bill is so lawless so illegal so criminal that this shows that we have
[09:36.760 --> 09:42.400]  real tyrants running the country and that none of us are safe I mean Limbaugh is
[09:42.400 --> 09:48.840]  actually telling the truth the complete truth in saying this did did you hear
[09:48.840 --> 09:55.880]  about this did you hear him say this the phones are only open for doctors
[09:55.880 --> 10:01.520]  and nurses and if you heard Limbaugh talk about it and I'll have the guys I try
[10:01.520 --> 10:06.920]  to pull up the clip and find it but I mean no doubt it was said my dad doesn't
[10:06.920 --> 10:10.240]  make stuff up he was right a few weeks ago when he said he heard Limbaugh say
[10:10.240 --> 10:14.680]  that because he tunes back and forth from my show to Limbaugh show when he's not
[10:14.680 --> 10:24.040]  working or when he's at lunch oh man I mean that's the thing about this is that
[10:24.040 --> 10:34.520]  you cannot deny anymore that the time is late we are in deep trouble as a
[10:34.520 --> 10:42.120]  society now I have a lot of important news that just becomes more and more
[10:42.120 --> 10:49.960]  amazing more and more absurdist more and more ridiculous every day and we're
[10:49.960 --> 10:52.640]  going to be getting to that coming up a little bit at the bottom of the hour and
[10:52.640 --> 10:59.720]  more throughout the broadcast today but I do want to go to your calls now coming
[10:59.720 --> 11:05.840]  up loophole exempts Washington insiders from Obamacare mandate we went look to
[11:05.840 --> 11:11.600]  the subsection of the bill it's there Politico is also reported on this but the
[11:11.600 --> 11:15.040]  story is very very important this needs to get out to everyone this is the
[11:15.040 --> 11:22.720]  essence of tyranny it's really the coup de gras or the cherry on top to have a
[11:22.720 --> 11:30.000]  government that exempts itself from the laws that it foist on its slave subjects
[11:30.000 --> 11:38.080]  in the last five years the European Union bureaucracy has exempted itself from
[11:38.080 --> 11:45.760]  the upwards of 60 percent tax rate in Europe under EU control they have exempted
[11:45.760 --> 11:55.400]  themselves down to 17 percent or they pay less than a third of what everyone
[11:55.400 --> 12:01.000]  else does and then all the tax laws are selectively enforced with a really rich
[12:01.000 --> 12:09.120]  billionaires pay almost no taxes separately from that most of the IRS
[12:09.120 --> 12:12.520]  enforcers in this country don't even target middle class they target working
[12:12.520 --> 12:18.040]  class blue collar folks most of the investigators are targeting them because
[12:18.040 --> 12:24.160]  the criminals run the system from the top they want to be exempt and they are
[12:24.160 --> 12:27.360]  how many congressmen and their wives don't pay taxes
[12:27.360 --> 12:35.040]  Geithner runs the treasury we'll also get into Dr. Paul Craig Roberts saying
[12:35.040 --> 12:38.800]  goodbye truth has fallen and taken liberty with it we'll talk about his
[12:38.800 --> 12:44.520]  final editorial article he says he is done writing editorial columns I talked
[12:44.520 --> 12:48.120]  to him yesterday on the telephone he scheduled to be coming on later in the
[12:48.120 --> 12:55.320]  show next week he's moving right now and again Andrew Napolitano this new book
[12:55.320 --> 13:00.640]  lies the government told you myth power and deception in American history that
[13:00.640 --> 13:03.600]  is coming up
[13:09.360 --> 13:16.280]  also cops in New Jersey town given keys to homes that's right and they want to
[13:16.280 --> 13:19.720]  have this nationwide where the police just have a key to your house and it's
[13:19.720 --> 13:24.880]  illegal to have burglar bars we are prisoners the entire country the entire
[13:24.880 --> 13:29.320]  world is being turned into a giant prison that is only the tip of the
[13:29.320 --> 13:37.240]  iceberg of the news but as I said I want to go to your phone calls right now
[13:37.240 --> 13:42.600]  but I'm telling the listeners I want to hear from doctors or nurses people
[13:42.600 --> 13:48.240]  directly affected by this insurance company takeover this is not even
[13:48.240 --> 13:53.040]  socialism it's tyranny where they socialize your wealth and then feed it
[13:53.040 --> 14:00.400]  in to their financial system and don't forget what Bloomberg is reporting and
[14:00.400 --> 14:04.440]  I've been talking about this since last week but we're going to cover it more
[14:04.440 --> 14:10.560]  today the FDIC and the federal government are pressuring government
[14:10.560 --> 14:17.360]  pension funds particularly but private ones as well for cities counties fire
[14:17.360 --> 14:25.280]  police teachers to invest their money in the banks to quote prop them up to
[14:25.280 --> 14:30.840]  invest in the bad loans I mean that those are quotes so you think the
[14:30.840 --> 14:34.600]  socialist health care attaching your wages controlling your life and lowering
[14:34.600 --> 14:38.040]  your standard of care you know cutting Medicare and Medicaid while raising taxes
[14:38.040 --> 14:42.920]  you think that's a robbery a rape they are now moving to take your pension
[14:42.920 --> 14:46.000]  funds and many people have already had much or all of their private pension
[14:46.000 --> 14:50.680]  funds stolen these big CEOs and their and their top shareholders move the
[14:50.680 --> 14:54.280]  assets out into other shell corporations and sell off their assets and then
[14:54.280 --> 14:59.880]  announce oh the the company's bankrupt sorry you don't get your pension you
[14:59.880 --> 15:04.480]  know about in Ron and global crossing and companies like that but the hundreds
[15:04.480 --> 15:08.200]  of companies the last five years have stolen the pension funds all are part
[15:08.200 --> 15:15.360]  remember Bush in 2005 got the policies changed for that and I warns you then
[15:15.360 --> 15:22.280]  they were setting up a debt bubble and getting ready to rob you this is all
[15:22.280 --> 15:26.960]  illegal and lawless and until we get angry and say no and really face up to
[15:26.960 --> 15:30.520]  how evil and corrupt and legitimate our government is it's only gonna get worse
[15:30.520 --> 15:35.680]  people have to grow up and realize that tyranny is the norm in the world and
[15:35.680 --> 15:41.480]  that it's happening here in a really bad way I can't look at Nancy Pelosi she is
[15:41.480 --> 15:47.640]  seriously a narcissistic demon goblin and I can't look at Obama I can't look
[15:47.640 --> 15:52.720]  at Newt Gennrich I can't look at Senator Lindsey Graham that guy wants the
[15:52.720 --> 15:57.760]  healthcare bill that guy wants the carbon taxes with Republicans like these
[15:57.760 --> 16:04.960]  we have no hope no hope okay let's go to your calls I'm gonna talk to Dr. Hall
[16:04.960 --> 16:12.560]  first in Florida Dr. Hall you're on the air go ahead morning Alex hi I I just
[16:12.560 --> 16:17.000]  wanted to bring up a couple of points number one I'm a practicing family
[16:17.000 --> 16:22.600]  practice doc here in in Miami Beach there was no tour reform built into this
[16:22.600 --> 16:27.080]  bill we have South Florida's one of the highest litigious states in areas in the
[16:27.080 --> 16:33.440]  country what are we gonna do about that number two we have the patient protection
[16:33.440 --> 16:37.160]  affordability care act provides five billion dollars for high-risk pool
[16:37.160 --> 16:43.880]  folks who are have HIV AIDS these folks are allocated five billion dollars for
[16:43.880 --> 16:49.400]  this pool and what I've calculated by the CBO's own estimates it's four
[16:49.400 --> 16:55.360]  thousand dollars per person and you have perhaps two billion dollars per five
[16:55.360 --> 16:59.400]  hundred thousand individuals to cover this and that's just a healthy person
[16:59.400 --> 17:03.400]  so there's no way they can afford to provide any sort of care for folks with
[17:03.400 --> 17:10.240]  HIV AIDS which is pretty endemic in our part of the world here well that's a
[17:10.240 --> 17:16.240]  good point and we do need tort reform but instead you've got big pharma the
[17:16.240 --> 17:21.520]  vaccine makers that are all but immune when their vaccines kill and main people
[17:21.520 --> 17:27.280]  in mass but then meanwhile folks go to doctors now and they expect the doctor
[17:27.280 --> 17:34.360]  to be able to heal them of anything and everything they have when in some cases
[17:34.360 --> 17:41.520]  doctors just can't heal you or something goes wrong because doctors are not God
[17:41.520 --> 17:47.360]  and then people sue them you know people sue if they get an infection when their
[17:47.360 --> 17:55.160]  tooth gets pulled people sue if you know the doctor fixes their broken leg and
[17:55.160 --> 17:58.520]  then they don't wear the crutches right and fall downstairs and break it again
[17:58.520 --> 18:02.280]  and you've got all these lawyers that are out of control and the whole system
[18:02.280 --> 18:06.240]  is shut up to go after doctors and people wonder why health care costs have
[18:06.240 --> 18:10.760]  gone up so much a big part of it is the fact that the doctors have to buy
[18:10.760 --> 18:13.760]  liability insurance I mean I've read where some doctors are spending a
[18:13.760 --> 18:17.120]  couple hundred thousand dollars a year just on their liability insurance if
[18:17.120 --> 18:21.680]  you've been sued once or twice you see tens of thousands of patients many of
[18:21.680 --> 18:25.960]  them are mentally ill schizophrenic nuts who start accusing the doctors of all
[18:25.960 --> 18:31.040]  manner of us made up garbage and they've always got some slime ball lawyer
[18:31.040 --> 18:35.160]  ready to sue that's another good point you made well you know defensive
[18:35.160 --> 18:40.000]  medicine they calculate cost is about 90 to 150 billion dollars a year I bet the
[18:40.000 --> 18:45.200]  costs are higher than that Catherine Seville is who's you know HHS had was
[18:45.200 --> 18:49.000]  the lead trial attorney lobbyist for the state of Kansas you know of course
[18:49.000 --> 18:53.400]  she's involved with this so it doesn't surprise me that we're we're facing a
[18:53.400 --> 18:57.720]  you know we're going to have a huge issue doctors are going to be retiring
[18:57.720 --> 19:01.360]  and folks are going to go to CVS or Walmart for their health care get
[19:01.360 --> 19:05.920]  their snickers and their pap smear because that's where it's headed let me
[19:05.920 --> 19:12.960]  ask you one more question dr. Hall family practitioner there in Florida the
[19:12.960 --> 19:16.400]  insurance companies did write the bill that's in the Wall Street Journal it's
[19:16.400 --> 19:21.200]  in Bloomberg it's back in the news today but they just quietly have a few
[19:21.200 --> 19:26.720]  paragraphs here and there going well actually the biggest insurance companies
[19:26.720 --> 19:30.680]  actually wrote this and this makes 30 million people get insurance and they
[19:30.680 --> 19:35.440]  and it allows them to lower their care when come back I want to ask you are
[19:35.440 --> 19:40.360]  the doctors you're talking to and are your patients aware that this is not just
[19:40.360 --> 19:45.160]  some freebie giveaway and again it's also in the Associated Press that this
[19:45.160 --> 19:49.880]  doesn't cover children with pre-existing conditions the group that the
[19:49.880 --> 19:53.480]  government supposedly wanted to help more than anyone we'll get your take on
[19:53.480 --> 20:01.560]  that and talk to her rich Frank Tony Nessa and others stay with us you worry

[24:05.440 --> 24:10.800]  all right going back to Dr. Hall in Florida with my question are doctors
[24:10.800 --> 24:18.360]  aware of the fact that this is a insurance company scam Dr. Hall Alex I
[24:18.360 --> 24:21.720]  don't think many of my colleagues are aware of what's going on I don't think
[24:21.720 --> 24:26.360]  any of them have read the 2,700 pages or even one page they're so caught up in
[24:26.360 --> 24:30.520]  trying to see patients every five minutes I don't think they know yeah I'll
[24:30.520 --> 24:34.840]  tell you this the problem crisis solution issue that we have with the
[24:34.840 --> 24:40.800]  health insurer particular well-point in anthem California two three weeks ago
[24:40.800 --> 24:45.000]  right before this thing came down they increased rates by 39 percent there is
[24:45.000 --> 24:48.840]  the problem the crisis was there what's the solution past the Obamacare plan
[24:48.840 --> 24:53.840]  came right down our throats they're all in cahoots it's a big roost and I I
[24:53.840 --> 24:58.600]  really believe and until doctors wake up which most of them are asleep
[24:58.600 --> 25:02.520]  unfortunately they're so caught up in paperwork and red tape with the insurance
[25:02.520 --> 25:07.160]  companies trying to get paid I don't think anything's gonna happen I agree
[25:07.160 --> 25:10.920]  with you and I appreciate your call in fact before the bill even passed a few
[25:10.920 --> 25:15.480]  weeks ago I saw press reports where the government just cut Medicare and Medicaid
[25:15.480 --> 25:21.240]  fund preemptively by more than 20 percent so that's all this is ladies and
[25:21.240 --> 25:25.320]  gentlemen is a giant government takeover of healthcare to lower quality and
[25:25.320 --> 25:29.760]  ensure bigger profits for the bank owned insurance companies let's talk to
[25:29.760 --> 25:39.160]  Nessa in New York here on the air hello hi hi Alex I work in New York and it
[25:39.160 --> 25:43.680]  seems like that we're having a hard time keeping our jobs here because the city
[25:43.680 --> 25:50.920]  is going bankrupt and I just wanted to say that I thought it was inevitable that
[25:50.920 --> 25:55.080]  this would pass I thought it was inevitable because they really had our
[25:55.080 --> 26:00.600]  hearts they had our hearts when we think about you know the patient or the
[26:00.600 --> 26:05.920]  family that went bankrupt not being able to afford the treatment that they needed
[26:05.920 --> 26:11.680]  or everybody has a story like that and if what you're saying is true and I
[26:11.680 --> 26:15.640]  guess I have to read the health care bill then we really wasted a goal and
[26:15.640 --> 26:20.800]  opportunity we could have been this could have been an opportunity for us to be
[26:20.800 --> 26:27.040]  ahead of the curve in the world we could have used this as as as a launching
[26:27.040 --> 26:32.200]  pad and we could have just researched in and patented the technology the
[26:32.200 --> 26:36.280]  government could and the American people could have exported technology to
[26:36.280 --> 26:40.480]  other countries well Nessa here's the problem and I appreciate your call we
[26:40.480 --> 26:47.280]  don't have nice people running the government and so any bill they pass is
[26:47.280 --> 26:52.640]  going to be a scam just like the banker bailout bill you had 99% of Americans
[26:52.640 --> 26:57.560]  in polls against it a year and a half ago back in October 2008 but it still
[26:57.560 --> 27:01.760]  happened and you're saying this was inevitable to pass because they had our
[27:01.760 --> 27:08.320]  hearts before it passed over 70% now it's over 80% are against the bill
[27:08.320 --> 27:13.080]  because people are actually having a chance to look at subsections of it in
[27:13.080 --> 27:18.000]  England in Europe in Canada by every yardstick they have even worse health
[27:18.000 --> 27:22.040]  care than we do oh the government taxes you and then supposedly gives you free
[27:22.040 --> 27:26.480]  health care that's like the government saying we give school kids free laptops
[27:26.480 --> 27:33.320]  they're not free it's paid for with taxpayer money and then they use the
[27:33.320 --> 27:39.080]  laptops to watch you at home illegally anything they give you has strings
[27:39.080 --> 27:44.120]  attached it's like of the mafia comes and offers to give you a loan at 30%
[27:44.120 --> 27:51.480]  interest you don't take it it's designed to make you a debt slave and I
[27:51.480 --> 27:56.440]  cleaned off my stack from the last two days here so hey well you guys print me
[27:56.440 --> 28:01.760]  that AP article again oversight and health bill children with preexisting
[28:01.760 --> 28:08.200]  conditions not covered and I'll read the subsection again if what I'm saying is
[28:08.200 --> 28:15.800]  true of course what I'm saying is true I mean I want you to know listeners please
[28:15.800 --> 28:20.080]  check out what I say I don't make stuff up I occasionally make a mistake here
[28:20.080 --> 28:25.360]  there but but very rarely and it's normally just on a date or a the or an
[28:25.360 --> 28:30.000]  amount or a bill number and I get little things like that wrong but we're
[28:30.000 --> 28:35.200]  telling the truth Frank in North Carolina did you hear Limbaugh talk about
[28:35.200 --> 28:42.560]  talk about they're not being elections coming up Alex I did want to speak about
[28:42.560 --> 28:45.800]  Rush Limbaugh but I didn't hear that particular thing but I did want to back
[28:45.800 --> 28:50.920]  you up what you're saying last January I just got laid off from work I was home
[28:50.920 --> 28:54.440]  and I turned on Rush Limbaugh I hate him I can't stand it but you know kind of
[28:54.440 --> 29:00.880]  monitoring enemy radio waves he he spent about a minute before he went to a
[29:00.880 --> 29:04.640]  commercial break right at the beginning of the show and the first 15 minutes he
[29:04.640 --> 29:09.680]  said everything that you say about the New World Order the elites how they're
[29:09.680 --> 29:12.880]  running everything about how the president and all that those guys are
[29:12.880 --> 29:16.120]  all just pumped I couldn't believe it I mean I listened to Rush Limbaugh for
[29:16.120 --> 29:21.000]  15 years I was a mind-numb robot listening to that guy and I could not
[29:21.000 --> 29:25.720]  believe my ears what I was hearing so I'm like you know hanging on after you
[29:25.720 --> 29:28.680]  know when it goes to commercial I'm like oh my god I can't believe he's talked
[29:28.680 --> 29:33.440]  about this he comes back I listened to the rest the rest of the show two and
[29:33.440 --> 29:40.480]  three-quarter hours he doesn't mention it ever again well I know he said this
[29:40.480 --> 29:43.360]  yesterday because my dad said he heard it we're looking for the transcript but
[29:43.360 --> 29:48.200]  he said Obama may suspend elections and I agree with it thank you Frank we'll be

[34:49.520 --> 34:53.800]  legislation a potential problem emerged oh a potential administration
[34:53.800 --> 34:59.000]  officials not servants their officials are now scrambling to keep a gap in
[34:59.000 --> 35:02.760]  highly touted benefits for children Obama made better coverage for children a
[35:02.760 --> 35:08.080]  centerpiece of his health care remake but it turns out the letter of the law
[35:08.080 --> 35:12.960]  provided a less than complete guarantee that kids with health problems would not
[35:12.960 --> 35:17.920]  be shut out of coverage and it goes on to say how it now exists under the new
[35:17.920 --> 35:21.720]  law insurance companies still would be able to refuse new coverage to children
[35:21.720 --> 35:27.960]  because of a pre-existing medical condition said Karen Lightfoot spokeswoman
[35:27.960 --> 35:31.320]  for the House Energy and Commerce Committee one of the main congressional
[35:31.320 --> 35:36.280]  panels that wrote the Obama bill into law folks
[35:39.800 --> 35:44.040]  the way I read the bill it says insurance companies can deny anybody with a
[35:44.040 --> 35:50.880]  pre-existing condition and then you get pushed on to Medicare Medicaid which
[35:50.880 --> 35:54.880]  they cut the funding for and they're gonna add tens of millions of people to
[35:54.880 --> 35:59.560]  I mean it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that's a lie all right
[35:59.560 --> 36:04.160]  I'm gonna go quickly to your calls now let's go ahead and talk to Rich in New
[36:04.160 --> 36:11.440]  York you're on the air hello Alex welcome oh my god I'm so glad I got through
[36:11.440 --> 36:15.360]  with you I talked with you once before I'm a health care worker here in New York
[36:15.360 --> 36:18.680]  City I'm just gonna tell my phone now by the way this is an internet phone I hope
[36:18.680 --> 36:24.520]  it sounds clear sounds fine go ahead all right we talked once before about the
[36:24.520 --> 36:31.840]  whole whole forced inoculation issue and I'm so happy that you woke me up and I
[36:31.840 --> 36:36.560]  got down to a lobby one time in Manhattan and Judge McNamara shot that
[36:36.560 --> 36:43.240]  down as you well know and they're gonna probably continue on a new front to try
[36:43.240 --> 36:48.480]  to do this to us again we're seeing it over and over real quickly I work in a
[36:48.480 --> 36:55.920]  hospital there was a Matt emergency managers meeting today in regard to
[36:55.920 --> 37:02.080]  emergency preparedness and a whole host of other issues this is nothing new I
[37:02.080 --> 37:06.600]  mean it's going on for a long time my whole concerns I think they're gonna
[37:06.600 --> 37:11.560]  turn the hospital system in New York City into a prison system well it's not
[37:11.560 --> 37:17.560]  the first time that they've actually had clientele from said institutions like
[37:17.560 --> 37:22.360]  Rikers and other things I think they use that as a beta test on the general
[37:22.360 --> 37:26.920]  population of the hospital like the hospital workers fish themselves to
[37:26.920 --> 37:34.320]  coexist with a prison population and all the patients like prisoners true
[37:34.320 --> 37:43.080]  precisely so it's like just a again a slow gradual process of no this system
[37:43.080 --> 37:47.480]  is run by psych warfare experts so everything is done in a psychological
[37:47.480 --> 37:53.080]  operant conditioning creeping programming yeah Frank Zappa talked about it a
[37:53.080 --> 37:57.200]  long time ago that's why I wish he would use Frank Warren is for your bump
[37:57.200 --> 38:01.480]  music I'm not gonna tell you what to do but Frank Frank Zappa knew about this a
[38:01.480 --> 38:04.880]  long time ago Jason's a little more open-minded to Frank Zappa I think he's
[38:04.880 --> 38:08.600]  a little too too censored on the waves we don't want to get you in trouble with
[38:08.600 --> 38:14.760]  the FCC or not I'm not censoring Frank Zappa I've had his widow on awesome
[38:14.760 --> 38:21.480]  awesome I played extended interviews with him I've played interviews where he
[38:21.480 --> 38:25.480]  was on crossfire so you may have missed that but I appreciate your call I mean
[38:25.480 --> 38:31.840]  look there's so much to cover here Fess Parker died last week I'm a big fan of
[38:31.840 --> 38:37.920]  his music and I didn't even know about it till yesterday in fact guys remind me
[38:37.920 --> 38:43.880]  to play that Long Live George Washington intro coming into the next segment I
[38:43.880 --> 38:47.520]  want to play that for folks thank you caller let's talk to Linda in
[38:47.520 --> 38:55.360]  California go ahead hi hey Linda you're on the air welcome good to have you here
[38:55.360 --> 39:03.520]  with us yeah I'm a nurse and I was married to a practicing physician who was
[39:03.520 --> 39:10.520]  impacted for over 40 years in California and back in 1965 he predicted all of this
[39:10.520 --> 39:16.760]  and he said physicians will rue the day that you know medicare can you try to
[39:16.760 --> 39:22.640]  get a little bit closer to your telephone yeah can you hear me better yeah go
[39:22.640 --> 39:29.880]  ahead okay I think that this is you know really been going on for a long time
[39:29.880 --> 39:36.040]  and I'm still working actively in health care the hospital situation and I see
[39:36.040 --> 39:43.000]  where all the older doctors who know what's coming are going to quit and the
[39:43.000 --> 39:48.840]  younger doctors have been trained over the last 15 20 years to just accept
[39:48.840 --> 39:54.440]  whatever the government says with organizations like jaco and AMA and
[39:54.440 --> 40:04.200]  others that put down these Medicare as the leading say so on whatever was done
[40:04.200 --> 40:09.520]  medically exactly in the last 30 years the government in collusion with the
[40:09.520 --> 40:13.160]  insurance companies has already taken over health care and it's all the
[40:13.160 --> 40:17.720]  bureaucracy in the red tape and not letting the actual medical experts the
[40:17.720 --> 40:23.160]  doctors and nurses and specialist run things as soon as the bureaucrat started
[40:23.160 --> 40:27.080]  running health care it was doomed and we're going to end up just like England
[40:27.080 --> 40:31.040]  where you wait a year and a half for cancer surgery the lowest survivability
[40:31.040 --> 40:35.240]  of any western nation it's going to be absolutely destroyed which is exactly
[40:35.240 --> 40:39.240]  what the control freaks want but they're all exempt and they will all go to
[40:39.240 --> 40:43.320]  elite clinics I appreciate your call and here's the article up on prison
[40:43.320 --> 40:50.520]  planet calm loophole exempts Washington insiders from Obamacare mandate no
[40:50.520 --> 40:54.720]  Obamacare for Obama his family his staff the vice president the vice president
[40:54.720 --> 40:59.240]  staff the rest of the administration Nancy Pelosi Nancy Pelosi staff Senate
[40:59.240 --> 41:02.840]  majority leader Harry Reid Reid staff all other House and Senate leaders and
[41:02.840 --> 41:07.160]  their staff all committee members and their staff the list goes on that's from
[41:07.160 --> 41:13.640]  Politico now if it's so good for all of us why are they exempt why did the
[41:13.640 --> 41:19.240]  German government and German military demand a adjutant and mercury free
[41:19.240 --> 41:25.080]  special vaccine for H1N1 and then they even refused that why did we find out
[41:25.080 --> 41:29.400]  the British government wasn't really taking real vaccines but was taking
[41:29.400 --> 41:37.440]  fake saltwater shots on the news if it's so good come on people realize what's
[41:37.440 --> 41:41.600]  happening this is a criminal operation a loophole written into the financial
[41:41.600 --> 41:45.960]  health care reform bill passed on Sunday and signed the law by Obama yesterday
[41:45.960 --> 41:49.520]  exempts Washington insiders and committee staff members from the mandate
[41:49.520 --> 41:52.480]  that now requires every American to purchase health insurance members of
[41:52.480 --> 41:55.680]  Congress and their office staff will have to buy insurance through the will
[41:55.680 --> 41:59.760]  not have to buy through the state-run exchange created under the bill
[41:59.760 --> 42:04.400]  however those working for congressional committees or for party leaders in the
[42:04.400 --> 42:10.120]  House and Senate are excluded they don't have to page 158 of the bill defines
[42:10.120 --> 42:16.240]  congressional staff narrowly as employees employed by the official office of a
[42:16.240 --> 42:21.080]  member of Congress whether in the district office or in Washington the
[42:21.080 --> 42:24.600]  congressional research service believes a court could rule that the
[42:24.600 --> 42:28.200]  legislation would exclude professional committee staff joint committee staff
[42:28.200 --> 42:32.280]  some shared staff as well as potentially those staff employed by
[42:32.280 --> 42:37.320]  leadership offices if that's so staffers who work for Nancy Pelosi in her
[42:37.320 --> 42:42.320]  capacity as representative from California would go into the exchange
[42:42.320 --> 42:46.880]  program while staffers who work for her in her capacity a speaker would stay on
[42:46.880 --> 42:50.680]  the government's plan other capital employees like those who work for the
[42:50.680 --> 42:56.080]  clerk of the House of the House of Historian would be similarly exempted
[42:56.080 --> 43:03.640]  this is complete and total discrimination on a massive on a ultra massive
[43:03.640 --> 43:09.440]  level and they know what they're doing this is another reason to have this
[43:09.440 --> 43:17.480]  thing repealed it is discriminatory let's go to Rob in Georgia you're on the
[43:17.480 --> 43:24.960]  year good afternoon Alex welcome thank you just a couple quick things and I've
[43:24.960 --> 43:30.440]  got a run here myself because I'm actually in the office today huge boon for
[43:30.440 --> 43:34.680]  the pharmaceutical companies once again you mentioned AIG the insurance
[43:34.680 --> 43:41.000]  companies but if I recall correctly in the national health care proposal was
[43:41.000 --> 43:47.160]  that you had to carry prescription drug coverage yes yes they're said to make
[43:47.160 --> 43:51.760]  hundreds of billions of dollars every few years off of this that's why the
[43:51.760 --> 43:55.520]  insurance companies and big pharma lobbied for the bill and wrote the
[43:55.520 --> 44:00.520]  stinking thing as well as a Medicare Part D because that's the type of health
[44:00.520 --> 44:05.640]  care you're going to get is the drugs this is this is the comparative care
[44:05.640 --> 44:10.280]  where the government and the insurance companies decide what you get taking
[44:10.280 --> 44:14.800]  control away from doctors and nurses and it also has unfunded Medicare
[44:14.800 --> 44:21.120]  Medicaid doubling on the states it makes the states pay for most of this as a
[44:21.120 --> 44:25.960]  separate tax on top of the other taxes in the bill that are federal which will
[44:25.960 --> 44:29.960]  then make the states raise taxes well and I know here in Georgia that they're
[44:29.960 --> 44:33.760]  already gonna go after on a constitutional on basis but the last
[44:33.760 --> 44:37.960]  thing I want to mention to you is it's kind of a bombshell for physicians I've
[44:37.960 --> 44:42.400]  worked with them for 21 years now and I work in the farm partly in the
[44:42.400 --> 44:45.280]  pharmaceutical industry but I want to tell you that what people don't know
[44:45.280 --> 44:49.520]  and understand is these drugs that we take in the US for the greater part
[44:49.520 --> 44:54.120]  aren't made here anymore they're made in India some of which the active
[44:54.120 --> 44:58.800]  ingredients are made in China and then they're sold back to the US market if I
[44:58.800 --> 45:05.040]  can real quick give you a quote from this is Asia Times 2005 it says India
[45:05.040 --> 45:08.840]  today has the largest number of US food and drug administrative approved
[45:08.840 --> 45:14.400]  manufacturing facilities outside the US drug master files which have to be
[45:14.400 --> 45:21.520]  approved by the FDA before a drug can enter the US market file up these 126
[45:21.520 --> 45:27.720]  companies have filed that's more than Spain Italy China and Israel put
[45:27.720 --> 45:31.680]  together they're gonna say we're talking about we're talking Asia Times May of
[45:31.680 --> 45:37.480]  2005 that's five years ago and we now have these Chinese made vaccines filled
[45:37.480 --> 45:43.240]  with live pig virus and everything else it's amazing well the thing is the
[45:43.240 --> 45:46.680]  point is they're not only getting a freebie from the government you know
[45:46.680 --> 45:50.160]  why they're going there is because they can make it for ten cents on a dollar and
[45:50.160 --> 45:55.760]  they could they could sell it to the UK and your local pharmacy for the you know
[45:55.760 --> 45:59.500]  the price that you would know at full price that you would only pay at the
[45:59.500 --> 46:04.840]  pharmacy it's a complete total ripoff I appreciate your call great points let's
[46:04.840 --> 46:08.080]  talk to Jeremy calling from California go ahead
[46:08.080 --> 46:15.720]  hey man on Monday I wanted to I listened to a wide swath of radio to see what
[46:15.720 --> 46:20.000]  the to gauge what the temperature was out there as far as the bill I listened
[46:20.000 --> 46:24.840]  to Tom Hartman Rush Limbaugh everybody and what you said about Limbaugh was
[46:24.840 --> 46:29.200]  actually a trip because I did notice that and the interesting thing is through
[46:29.200 --> 46:33.560]  that throughout the day there seemed to be a major theme on the right and on the
[46:33.560 --> 46:37.080]  left everybody just gauging their own opinion and they were basically taking
[46:37.080 --> 46:42.920]  the establishment line but I I was struck by Limbaugh because it did seem like it
[46:42.920 --> 46:47.880]  almost seemed like he was restraining himself from really going into you know
[46:47.880 --> 46:54.080]  going down the avenue of truth and when he said that about elections he didn't
[46:54.080 --> 46:59.000]  just say it once he said it multiple times and you know it was it it was a
[46:59.000 --> 47:04.480]  big thinking you know he has a lot to lose you know after everything he's
[47:04.480 --> 47:09.920]  built up if this thing goes down he doesn't have a golden parachute you know
[47:09.920 --> 47:14.920]  he's got the same money that we have and so it was it was definitely a
[47:14.920 --> 47:19.800]  mind-blower well I'll go back to Bloomberg with quotes from the federal
[47:19.800 --> 47:25.960]  government telling state agencies around the nation to invest fire police
[47:25.960 --> 47:32.960]  military you name it pension funds to quote prop up bad loans in banks I mean
[47:32.960 --> 47:36.960]  they're openly saying they're taking your retirement money this is to the
[47:36.960 --> 47:42.320]  government people and putting it into the corrupt banks I mean it's just the
[47:42.320 --> 47:48.720]  time for screwing around is over the time for denial is over so many
[47:48.720 --> 47:52.800]  countries fall to hardcore corruption and oppression and authoritarian
[47:52.800 --> 47:59.040]  oppression and tyranny because the public cannot believe it's actually
[47:59.040 --> 48:03.000]  happening the public cannot believe they're actually being robbed they
[48:03.000 --> 48:07.640]  cannot believe that there are bad people in the world where do you think
[48:07.640 --> 48:11.880]  corrupt bad people go they go into government because in government they
[48:11.880 --> 48:18.120]  can rob the people and team up with big corporations to create monopolies and
[48:18.120 --> 48:23.360]  take over society it's all true the world government the eugenics the
[48:23.360 --> 48:28.400]  poisoning of the water the dumbing down of the population that the the training
[48:28.400 --> 48:35.080]  everyone to spy on their neighbors it's all happening that the jig is up folks
[48:35.080 --> 48:40.720]  the balloon went up a long time ago and if people don't grow up and really get
[48:40.720 --> 48:45.200]  serious it's over and so I'm glad Michael Savage and Limbaugh are talking about
[48:45.200 --> 48:48.600]  world government new world order now and talking about how the Republicans are
[48:48.600 --> 48:53.920]  just as bad you know Glenn Beck I've been watching him some he's getting a
[48:53.920 --> 48:59.480]  little bit better because I think you hit the nail on the head here there's a
[48:59.480 --> 49:03.600]  lot of nouveau reach and a lot of new wealth and a lot of even big establishment
[49:03.600 --> 49:11.400]  people that realize in a bona fide tyranny the ultra elite then rob the
[49:11.400 --> 49:17.640]  rest of the elite and that's the one reason this may get overturned is there
[49:17.640 --> 49:20.880]  a lot of wealthy people I don't mean people were $10 million I mean people
[49:20.880 --> 49:25.840]  worth a billion dollars who are now figuring out they are not part of the
[49:25.840 --> 49:30.400]  power structure and that this is a hot tyranny this isn't some good old boy
[49:30.400 --> 49:36.760]  corruption this is a hardcore mechanized police state and Limbaugh and all of them
[49:36.760 --> 49:40.520]  better start talking about the secret arrest legislation they need to start
[49:40.520 --> 49:43.520]  talking about the Mayak and Homeland Security reports and how all of this is
[49:43.520 --> 49:46.320]  set up for the American people they better start talking about the FEMA
[49:46.320 --> 49:50.080]  camps they better start talking about poison in the food and water they better
[49:50.080 --> 49:55.760]  go all the way because only the truth will save us and I've talked to some
[49:55.760 --> 50:00.640]  big radio executives who are scared and know what's going on and want to try to
[50:00.640 --> 50:04.480]  promote my show nationwide but the bigger shareholders above them won't let
[50:04.480 --> 50:09.640]  them do it so look look at some of the biggest radio networks out there their
[50:09.640 --> 50:14.200]  executives know full well I'm telling the truth they're not stupid they'd love
[50:14.200 --> 50:19.360]  to have Alex Jones on they know we get big ratings but they can't do it because
[50:19.360 --> 50:26.560]  the owners of the companies are top globalist I appreciate your call I have
[50:26.560 --> 50:30.960]  talked in the last few months to executives at the highest level that
[50:30.960 --> 50:35.480]  have contacted me and and they're not saying like they did ten years ago hey
[50:35.480 --> 50:39.240]  sell out they're saying yeah you're right we better we better do something yeah
[50:39.240 --> 50:42.840]  this is you know years ago I thought you were exaggerating a little bit it's all
[50:42.840 --> 50:46.400]  true it's worse than you said but you know you're absolutely right you know my
[50:46.400 --> 50:52.200]  wife wants to get out of here and it's bad see this is the trick of the
[50:52.200 --> 50:56.200]  authoritarians they always get all these idiots and and people that think they
[50:56.200 --> 51:02.560]  can be bought off to go along with it you can't bargain with the devil is it

[01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:58.960]  with this is to suspend elections they're trying to demonize the tea parties

[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:24.640]  what's important to you right now what do you what's number one on your front
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:28.440]  burner the the loss of freedom at the hands of the government which happens
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:32.160]  with every tick of the clock I kiddingly say in the beginning of that book
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:36.680]  which you were very kind to to mention Alex that when I told friends I was
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:40.760]  writing a book about the government and lies and that it was 4,000 pages long
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:44.560]  everybody laughed and said we're able to get all the lies in the 4,000 pages of
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:48.600]  course the publisher made the publisher made me stop at 300 pages but it shows
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:54.600]  you the the the perception that the public has is that the government does
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:59.840]  lie to us has been lying to us and we accept these lies and are willing to
[01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:04.000]  laugh about it even though every one of those lies I talk about in the book and
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.840]  even many that you just mentioned in the introduction destroys our liberty
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:12.840]  destroys our freedom by inducing us to make political decisions on erroneous
[01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:17.640]  information that the government claims is true and when we give up this liberty
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:24.320]  and lose this property we don't get it back absolutely when we come back I
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:27.320]  want to get into the health care bill I want to talk about what's next for these
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:32.680]  guys the blanket amnesty the national worker ID for citizens that illegals are
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:36.760]  exempt from I've read the bill it's the same thing in this bill the health care
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:41.800]  bill it talks about how we have to have an electronic medical ID card but it
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:48.280]  says illegals are again exempt from that no surprise that they would do
[01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:54.160]  something like that in order a to control us be to know where we are and
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:59.680]  what we're doing and see to create a permanent underclass fully dependent
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:02.960]  upon them the next thing you know is that they'll allow those folks to vote
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:07.080]  and you know which way they'll vote in favor of the party or the group or the
[01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:11.240]  candidate that gives them as big a piece of the pie to which we contribute at the
[01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:18.080]  point of a gun judge Andrew Napolitano the new book lies the government told

[01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:19.520]  tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:24.800]  the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:28.560]  attention. The fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:33.560]  the criminal off-short cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its
[01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:37.680]  ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists
[01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:41.200]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:46.440]  checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we

[01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:31.640]  chapter and verse and still some call in and say are you really telling the
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:38.840]  truth here's page 65 of the signed bill and it's in section bi eligibility for
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:44.840]  health plan and this is the actual section of the bill and it says may
[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:49.480]  allow for the use of a machine readable identification card and they have
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:53.280]  another bill where they make citizens have a national ID card to have a job
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:09:01.920]  but the illegals are exempt and you have a what 8% approval rating for read 10
[01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:07.720]  percent for Pelosi 11% for Congress they know that 80% of the public is
[01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:11.560]  against this healthcare takeover we know the insurance companies wrote it it's
[01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:17.280]  actually a scam the establishment knows what they're doing is unconstitutional
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:22.000]  and lawless but they're going ahead with it and that's why Rush Limbaugh and I
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.480]  agree with him I'm glad he's really coming out now and telling it like it is
[01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:30.440]  right said that they may suspend elections because he says there's no way
[01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:34.360]  they can they can win and that it appears they're putting in a police state
[01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:39.160]  control grid but as you know this was all set up in the last 20 30 years in this
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:44.640]  nation it's bipartisan Judge Napolitano what is the state of our union the state
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:48.800]  of our union is that it is a bipartisan movement toward a police state and we
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:52.680]  don't have two parties in this country Alex even though most people think we do
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:56.840]  your listeners know that we have one party the big government party there's a
[01:09:56.840 --> 01:10:02.000]  Republican wing that likes war and deficits and assaults our civil liberties
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.160]  there's a Democratic wing that likes welfare and taxes and assaults our
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:10.120]  commercial liberties but they basically will feed each other because they're
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:14.160]  not interested in freedom they don't believe in fidelity to the Constitution
[01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:19.520]  they're just interested in power I mean on my radio show last month I asked the
[01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:23.120]  number three ranking Democrat in the House of Representatives congressman
[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:27.040]  Jim Clyburn congressman where in the Constitution is the government
[01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:31.960]  authorized to regulate health care and he said to me judge most of what we do
[01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:36.800]  down here referring to Washington is not authorized by the Constitution where in
[01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:42.080]  the Constitution is it prohibited that we regulate health care the very fact
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:48.920]  that he would ask that question shows a create tremendous 180 degree
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:53.040]  misunderstanding of the federal government the Congress is not a general
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:58.560]  legislature it doesn't exist in order to right every wrong it exists only to
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:05.800]  exercise power in 17 unique discrete specific well-defined set out areas in
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:11.000]  a piece of paper called the Constitution to which he took an oath to uphold at
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.160]  least he was candid enough to acknowledge they're not upholding it but
[01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:20.320]  what is to become of us Alex if the government decides the extent of its
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:25.880]  own powers if the government freely admits it violates its oath to uphold
[01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:31.280]  the Constitution and if whenever financial or civil liberties are involved
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:36.880]  both sides of the government Republican and Democrat agree the president signs
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:41.640]  a new Patriot Act and he signs it in the undercover of darkness because he's
[01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:45.440]  afraid those to whom he promised he wouldn't do so might see a picture of
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:50.000]  him of him doing it the president when he was a senator blasted George W. Bush
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.120]  for conducting an illegal war he's killed as many people as Bush ever did
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:12:00.200]  and is sending drones to to Pakistan in more so in one year than Bush did in
[01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:06.800]  eight there there is very little change that comes about the elections in this
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:13.880]  country unless and until people there is very little change judge and once they
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:17.760]  start violating the Bill of Rights and Constitution the sky is the limit as you
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:21.680]  know as a constitutional law scholar and as a judge but the general public is
[01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:24.920]  just now beginning to discover this what about last week when they were
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:31.040]  still trying to just deem and pass this whole thing without even having the
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:35.360]  House vote on it I mean at least we force them to back off of that but that
[01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:41.920]  gives us a window into their wall as mindset exactly it shows us that they
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:48.080]  would have caused to become law not only that which they haven't read and we
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:50.720]  know they haven't read it because they made promises that their their
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:55.000]  scriveners found out last night aren't in there but that they haven't even voted
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:59.680]  on at least we shamed them into voting on it at least we know that Bart
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:04.720]  Stupak is no more pro-life than Barack Obama at least we know where people
[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:09.760]  truly stand on all of this because the the uproar from people all across the
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:14.720]  political spectrum forced them to vote how odd and quaint Alex that our
[01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:19.040]  representatives should actually vote on something and that we should be able to
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:25.000]  know how they voted you know when the extension of the Patriot Act was enacted
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:30.720]  in the Senate it was done by a voice vote so that no senator was recorded as to
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:34.600]  how he or she voted on it and when they changed the the definition of the word
[01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:39.280]  financial institution to mean a doctor's office a lawyer's office the post office
[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:43.160]  a computer server anything under the were under the sun which would let them
[01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:47.400]  serve a self-written search warrant on it that vote was taken by voice vote so
[01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:51.520]  there's no record of how anybody voted on it at least this time we have a record
[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:58.040]  so we want to vote the bums out we know who the bums are and on top of that we
[01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:04.560]  have bills in the last decade introduced to make them read the bills act and they
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:11.360]  fight that to the nail that Ron Paul introduces every year two simple four
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:16.840]  line bills every member of Congress shall certify under oath that he or she
[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:21.360]  has read a bill before voting for or against it and every bill this is the
[01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:25.720]  second one that is introduced must cite in the Constitution the authority for
[01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:31.600]  the bill neither of those proposals as simple basic and rational as could be a
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:36.200]  junior in high school social studies could understand them neither of those
[01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:40.440]  have seen the light of day neither of them ever makes it to a committee for
[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:44.000]  hearing but there may be some hope because you could have said the same
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:49.320]  thing about his proposal to audit the Fed ten years ago now it has passed the
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:52.800]  House of Representatives what will happen in the Senate I don't know but his
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:56.960]  persistence has caused the American public to be aware of these things and
[01:14:56.960 --> 01:15:02.360]  caused the public to pressure power hungry members of Congress occasionally to
[01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:08.680]  do the right thing judge Andrew Napolitano as a constitutional expert as
[01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:15.240]  a former judge reading over the bill and over the subsections there's so many
[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:20.800]  things that are unconstitutional and then there's also deception even the AP
[01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:27.080]  admits this doesn't protect people with self with with already existing
[01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:32.880]  conditions with children that is the one that mrs. Pelosi and company are
[01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:38.640]  stumbling over this morning Alex because they promised Democrats and the
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:43.640]  Democrats promised their constituents that children with pre-existing
[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:48.560]  conditions would be covered immediately now put aside the fact that the federal
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:54.160]  government has no authority whatsoever take it to the bank no authority
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:59.280]  whatsoever to regulate health care and to tell insurance carriers who they may
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:03.600]  ensure but even if you're for socialism this is another rip-off just like
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:07.800]  communism under the Soviets was a rip-off or socialism in england's a rip-off
[01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:11.520]  anytime they get a big pool of money they're gonna steal most of it they're
[01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:14.760]  not gonna give it of course because sooner or later you run out of other
[01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:19.120]  people's money but in this particular case they lied to their own people the
[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:24.200]  socialist monstrosity that they passed didn't even have in it the clauses that
[01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:29.440]  they used to sell it on the american people one of which is this your children
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:33.760]  will be taken care of from the minute the president signs it baloney they didn't
[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:38.000]  even read what they wrote they didn't even write what they wrote they just took
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:42.440]  passages and put it together by the way did you hear who praised the president's
[01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:48.120]  signing of this legislation just about 15 minutes before I was happy to come on
[01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:54.800]  your air let me guess fidel Castro fidel Castro praised Obamacare that's an
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:17:00.600]  endorsement if ever there was one well the state is god under the new world
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:07.320]  order system let's get into the unconstitutionality of this and how you
[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:11.840]  would attack it I don't think attorney general suing or joining their suit is
[01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:16.720]  enough we need to have states nullify under the 9th and 10th amendment and to
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:20.760]  not just roll this back but you're not going to take our highway funds you're
[01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:24.400]  not going to take our education funds I mean I think this is a wake-up call for
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:29.720]  people to really start reversing the fact that for a hundred plus years the
[01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:33.720]  federal government has been expanding its authority into areas that are
[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:38.520]  completely illegal well you know it's one thing Alex for a state legislature
[01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:42.200]  and a governor to sign a piece of paper saying we stand on our 10th amendment
[01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:46.840]  and we are a sovereign state it would be quite another for a state legislature
[01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:51.680]  to enact legislation that did the following prohibit state employees from
[01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:58.080]  enforcing federal law indict federal officials who come into the state with
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:03.400]  the intention of enforcing federal law that conflicts with state law impose a
[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:07.520]  real estate tax on federal property within the state now I know that that has
[01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:10.920]  been unlawful for the past 200 years but suffice it to say we have a
[01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:15.400]  different supreme court now that might look at this at this differently dragged
[01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:21.240]  before county and state grand juries federal officers who insist on enforcing
[01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:26.040]  federal law that is unconstitutional within the states the states really have
[01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:31.040]  to stand up for their sovereignty they have to do more than say we are a sovereign
[01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:36.120]  state there has to be teeth to their proclamation of sovereignty now I would
[01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:41.240]  like to see the popular election of senators done away with I would like
[01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:47.000]  to see state legislatures send members of the Senate to the Senate because then
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:51.400]  they wouldn't be stealing power from the states or those senators would soon be
[01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:55.320]  out of their jobs the federal government didn't begin to grow to gargantuan
[01:18:55.320 --> 01:19:00.080]  proportions until the progressive era with the popular election of senators
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:04.160]  who were able to pander to the collectivist impulses of the masses and
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:08.360]  deliver as big a piece of pie as they could and create the permanent
[01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:14.120]  underclass that relied on them for support and returned it with votes very
[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:20.800]  well said and let's come back and talk about constitutional ways to apply what
[01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:24.400]  you just discussed because if we do get the grand juries to start
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:28.640]  investigations and call for indictments if we do get the states to pass laws
[01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:32.800]  saying our employees will not comply with this that's all completely
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:36.960]  constitutional and other ideas other solutions because there's a lot of
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:41.360]  people listening right now folks are paying attention to these issues right
[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:47.000]  now folks are angry now is the time to take what Judge Napolitano is saying
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:52.480]  and I totally agree with him and to put it into force now is the time the
[01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:55.720]  Democrats have said they think you're gonna forget about this and they can
[01:19:55.720 --> 01:20:00.360]  slowly implement it and that's how they're gonna domesticate us we say no
[01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:06.920]  one major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system the main
[01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:10.200]  event is the wholesale destruction of the world caught the push for every

[01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:04.000]  hello Ted Anderson listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:07.720]  Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending therefore with
[01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:11.280]  catastrophic events it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently
[01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:14.840]  placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts
[01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:18.840]  a fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held
[01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:22.320]  in reserve for immediate withdrawal deficit spending will skyrocket through
[01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:26.000]  FDIC if the government is forced to ensure deposits during a bank run

[01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:34.000]  with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors however an
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:37.680]  increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity can cause

[01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:09.960]  my friends have you studied history and other empires nations republics corruption
[01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:16.600]  grows slowly like an infection and then it blooms and the nation falls and the
[01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:21.400]  elites that have become wealthy and powerful will use a police state to
[01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:26.680]  try to maintain control of the population that they've robbed and we've seen a
[01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:31.480]  premeditated development of this police state in their internal documents to
[01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:35.640]  suppress the american people it's the same thing worldwide and now you have
[01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:40.000]  these elites going offshore forming a global government openly saying a bank
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:43.880]  of the world that you will pay all your carbon taxes to talk about that in the
[01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:48.320]  next segment with judge andrew depolitano author best-selling author
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:51.240]  of multiple books his new book is out we'll tell you about the book and get
[01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:55.640]  into it before he leaves us but getting back into solutions on this obama care
[01:24:55.640 --> 01:25:01.160]  judge right am i right in saying that this is pretty much the make it or break
[01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:06.760]  it issue if we give into this and if we can't defeat this then the sky's the
[01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:12.200]  limit for these tyrants it is and vice president biden admitted as much
[01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:15.560]  yesterday when he said if we had to pass this we would have been toothless and
[01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:20.640]  now that we've passed this we have a lot else that we need to do first of all we
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:24.280]  know that the next eight months is going to be a rush to legislation because
[01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:27.400]  they know they're not stupid they know that they will never have the
[01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:31.480]  majorities in the congress after november if there is a november election
[01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:34.840]  that they have now so they're going to try and regulate as much as they can
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:39.480]  in the next eight eight months but but think about how insidious this is
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:43.720]  the supreme court has ruled countless times that the the most private
[01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:48.680]  conversation you have the one most utterly immune from governmental
[01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:52.600]  intrusion is with your physician more so than with your spouse
[01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:57.560]  it's with your physician this legislation purports with the stroke of a pen
[01:25:57.560 --> 01:26:01.480]  to do away with generations of that protection
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:06.200]  by putting a federal bureaucrat between you and your physician
[01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:09.640]  and permitting the bureaucrat to dictate to the physician
[01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:13.960]  what services are available to you and how much money is available
[01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:18.280]  for those services and it says they can share it with any federal agency they
[01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:20.920]  want and it says that those decisions by the
[01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:24.520]  bureaucrat are not appealable everything under the sun that the government
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:27.960]  does except the supreme court because that's the last appeal is
[01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:30.440]  appealable but this legislation says it's not
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:33.320]  appealable so they violate your right to privacy
[01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:37.160]  they violate your right to talk to your physician without the government there
[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:40.520]  they violate your right to the privacy of your medical records
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:44.120]  they decide how much money is available to pay your physician
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:47.960]  for the services that you may need is this the government
[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:53.320]  that the framers gave us or is this as you say alex so nicely
[01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:57.160]  the breaking point is this the point beyond which
[01:26:57.160 --> 01:27:02.360]  they cannot go now that leads us to the constitutional challenges to me
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:07.000]  the violation of privacy and the order that all americans
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:11.160]  shall purchase something whether they want it need it can afford it
[01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:15.480]  already have it or not purchase something that the government approves of
[01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:19.960]  are the two most obvious unconstitutional aspects of this
[01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:23.640]  there are many others it's against the constitution for the congress
[01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:27.400]  to tell a state legislature how it must legislate
[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:30.760]  and how it must spend that's called commandeering
[01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:34.520]  the legislature that's been prohibited for many years but the congress does it
[01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:38.360]  and gets away with it anyway but hold on hold on that's another key point you
[01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:41.560]  just rattled off is that and we've heard the state
[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:44.440]  legislatures and governors and attorney generals talk about this and it's in the
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:48.920]  bill that in some cases doubles the amount of money that states
[01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:52.440]  must levy to give to medicare and medicaid yes it does
[01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:55.960]  yes it does now normally when the congress wants to control a state
[01:27:55.960 --> 01:28:00.440]  legislature it bribes it so for example did you ever wonder why speed limits
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:04.040]  are the same all around the country did you ever wonder why the blood alcohol
[01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:08.360]  content in a person's veins sufficient to charge them for drunk driving is the
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:11.640]  same in every state did all 50 states just magically
[01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:15.640]  adopt the same standards no the congress adopted the standards
[01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:19.240]  was told by its lawyers these standards wouldn't fly because the constitution
[01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:22.760]  doesn't authorize the congress to do this so the congress went to the states
[01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:26.360]  and said here is hundreds of millions of dollars to
[01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:29.240]  repave your highways but if you accept this money
[01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:33.800]  you have to legislate about speed limits and blood alcohol content as we want
[01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:38.120]  that's a bribe if you or i alex or anybody listening to us now went to a
[01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:42.120]  state legislature and said here's cash now write the law the way i want it
[01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:45.560]  we would be arrested and rightly so for attempted bribery
[01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:49.160]  in this case with this health care legislation
[01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:53.160]  there is no bribe there is an outright command
[01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:57.320]  from the congress to the state legislatures you shall
[01:28:57.320 --> 01:29:01.560]  license more physicians you shall spend more money
[01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:04.520]  when the congress does that that's called
[01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:08.840]  commandeering a state legislature and the supreme court
[01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:13.320]  in the past 15 years has twice prohibited the congress from doing that
[01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:16.680]  so that's another unconstitutional aspect of this
[01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:21.560]  it invades an area of state sovereignty the regulation of the medical
[01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:27.320]  profession reserved to the states so we're right back to the declaration of
[01:29:27.320 --> 01:29:31.320]  independence where they talk about unelected governors
[01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:35.160]  coming in and overriding the legislatures commanding them
[01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:40.600]  taxation without representation the democrats know this is all illegal
[01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:43.640]  and i guess that's why limbaugh and others are openly saying they may try
[01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:46.360]  martial law now they want to take over the internet with
[01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:51.160]  cyber security we'll talk about it all straight ahead stay with us
[01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:57.400]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio
[01:29:57.400 --> 01:30:02.520]  network hi this is alex jones did you know that
[01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:05.960]  the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage

[01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:12.360]  non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold
[01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:15.880]  it's true seeds about reform even gold and silver before in this country and
[01:30:15.880 --> 01:30:19.560]  it's possible that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from

[01:33:34.280 --> 01:33:37.080]  and now that they've already done something this unpopular
[01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:41.560]  and committed political suicide right harry saying hey we got to go ahead and
[01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:44.440]  pass the carbon tax we got to go ahead and pass
[01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:48.600]  blanket total amnesty we've got to go ahead
[01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:53.240]  and pass cyber security which even the associated press says allows obama to
[01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:56.840]  completely shut the web off if he so chooses
[01:33:56.840 --> 01:34:00.840]  they want to pass the new enemy belligerence
[01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:04.680]  act that says for any intelligence value or such other matters
[01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:08.520]  as the president considers you may be secretly arrested
[01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:12.440]  and interrogated and held i mean they are and lindsay
[01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:16.920]  grand is arguing for similar legislation you know how how hideous that piece of
[01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:21.160]  legislation it is it actually says the only way you can get out of
[01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:26.200]  military confinement and even appear before a judge alex
[01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:30.920]  is if the house and senate intelligence committees vote to let you out
[01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:36.280]  what a perversion of our system of justice that instead of having judges
[01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:40.440]  say to the government thou shalt not violate the right of any person
[01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:44.280]  because the constitution protects persons not just good persons and not just
[01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:47.160]  americans but all persons they would have themselves
[01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:50.840]  politicians assume the judicial role and decide
[01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:55.240]  who can get away from the waterboarding and into a federal prison
[01:34:55.240 --> 01:34:59.720]  instead this is an orgy this is an orgy of power grabbing
[01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:03.240]  yes it is by the executive and yes it is the
[01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:07.160]  legislative and again i hear all these neocons on radio and tv saying
[01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:11.000]  oh we don't want to let al qaeda go but the point is we know
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:14.600]  that all of this is written and we have the homeland security internal documents
[01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:18.680]  this whole thing is designed and pointed at returning veterans
[01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:23.720]  gun owners conservatives libertarians this is for the american people you know
[01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:27.880]  when janet uh... the head of the uh... department of homeland security janet
[01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:30.680]  what's her name uh... announced that the most
[01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:33.320]  dangerous people on the planet where the groups you just
[01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:37.480]  uh... indicated uh... right to lifers people believe in the second
[01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:41.240]  amendment revert returning veterans from the wars
[01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:44.760]  people who think taxes are too high and the government is too onerous i got in
[01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:48.520]  an argument on air with one of my uh... fox colleagues
[01:35:48.520 --> 01:35:52.680]  who said to me well she knows that you are in favor of second amendment rights
[01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:55.960]  and she knows your pro-life and she knows you're against the iris
[01:35:55.960 --> 01:35:59.400]  but how does she know who that everybody else feels that way i said
[01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:04.600]  because she can capture her agents can capture every keystroke on your
[01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:07.560]  computer how can she do that he says
[01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:11.880]  because she has the power under the patriot act which you will tell you
[01:36:11.880 --> 01:36:15.000]  which fox colleague this was but you can probably guess
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:19.800]  which you supported when your guy george w bush was in the white house
[01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:23.240]  now it's in the hands of those who would use this power against you
[01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:26.920]  what are you crazy don't you realize liberty once given up
[01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:29.560]  and put in the hands of the government as power
[01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:34.200]  never comes back when will they learn
[01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:38.280]  when will they learn alex the patriot act wasn't enough for them to learn from
[01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:42.280]  now it's being used on them the neocons themselves this monstrosity from
[01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:45.800]  mccain and lindsay graham where they can lock up any american they want to
[01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:49.000]  waterboard the person until the legislature says to stop
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:55.480]  this is not america this is not america let's talk
[01:36:55.480 --> 01:36:58.760]  about the heart and soul of the republican party
[01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:03.640]  then the leadership predominantly are as you said just the other wing of the
[01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:07.640]  big government party they're the twins right and
[01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:12.440]  everywhere if george w bush had proposed obama care
[01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:15.960]  the republicans that are screaming the loudest now would be supporting it
[01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:19.560]  that's what i think of their fidelity to the constitution
[01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:23.320]  to the primacy of the individual and to the free market to them
[01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:27.800]  it's just a game of r versus d it has nothing to do
[01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:31.400]  with the natural law or human liberty i'm sorry for interrupting you i wanted to
[01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:34.760]  get that in because no no it's me no i totally agree
[01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:38.040]  claim to be pure here they're no more pure than the other side
[01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:41.800]  they just happen to be in the minority so it's convenient and comfortable for
[01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:46.760]  them to oppose this monstrosity well i agree with you let me
[01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:51.480]  then pose the question this way for you we've seen top republican strategists
[01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:54.840]  come out against ran paul and say they've got to defeat them
[01:37:54.840 --> 01:37:58.200]  they're now allowing the head election official who's
[01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:00.440]  running against ran paul and the republican
[01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:06.680]  a party to not recuse himself but run the election
[01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:11.320]  that he himself is running in correct the associated press up so i want to get
[01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:14.040]  your take on that we have all these other republican strategists
[01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:17.080]  demonizing the tea parties demonizing the berthers
[01:38:17.080 --> 01:38:21.000]  we know his names bury sataro we know he gave up a citizenship became an
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.640]  indonesian regardless of what happened in kenya
[01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:28.120]  and where there's smoke there's fire we know that the main line blue blood
[01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:35.080]  leadership is attempting to demonize and shut down debate and stop the american
[01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:38.680]  people from using the republican party to take our country back
[01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:42.920]  what you what are your expert recommendations because those were
[01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:47.240]  i mean absolutely spot on earlier on what the state should do with obama care
[01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:50.840]  what is your recommendation for the american people
[01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:53.960]  to not just let the republicans play the part of opposition
[01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:58.120]  and then get in power and and basically go along with all this i think the
[01:38:58.120 --> 01:39:02.440]  american people should vote out of office and and aggressively hound out of
[01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:06.840]  office lawfully obviously not only everyone who voted for obama care
[01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:10.520]  but everyone who voted for tarp proposed by george w bush
[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:14.680]  everyone who voted for the first two stimuluses that we've had in the past
[01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:18.920]  four years which came from george w bush everyone who voted for the patriot act
[01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:23.000]  which came from george w bush everyone who voted for any tax increase now that
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:27.640]  would be about 93 to 94 percent of the congress these
[01:39:27.640 --> 01:39:33.480]  people's voting records must be revealed the collusion of ran poll being
[01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:37.640]  forced to run against the guy who was in charge of counting the ballots even
[01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:42.760]  joe stalin wouldn't have been so bold as to do that he would have put a crony in
[01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:47.480]  to count the ballots but in kentucky the republicans are forcing ran poll to
[01:39:47.480 --> 01:39:50.920]  run against the guy who will decide who wins the the election
[01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:55.000]  the american public cannot put up with that they need to find to file lawsuits
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:58.600]  they need to listen to you they need to listen to what i attempt to do
[01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:02.520]  at fox they need to educate themselves they need to know what their rights are
[01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:06.200]  and they cannot taking this take this sitting down now alex you know
[01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:10.200]  i have been privileged to be the keynote speaker at many of these tea parties
[01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:14.040]  these folks are not going away they are not going to be co-opted by the
[01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:18.280]  republicans they are as much a threat to the republican leadership thank god
[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:21.560]  as they are to the democratic leadership because they understand
[01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:25.240]  that the constitution was written to keep the government
[01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:30.120]  off the people's backs not to find sneaky ways for the government to do it
[01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:35.720]  and get away with it let's expand into ran poll ron paul's son i mean in many
[01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:39.400]  polls he's ten points ahead right he's a shoe into win
[01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:42.520]  and this illustrates the republican leadership admits this
[01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:45.720]  this isn't just an anti-democrat incumbency
[01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:50.760]  this is an anti-incumbent period and the guy he's running against is getting
[01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:55.480]  all this aig banker money uh... he's a globalist and then meanwhile
[01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:58.920]  he's going to run the election and i talked to uh...
[01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:03.560]  uh... ran polls of people two days ago and they talked about they went to the
[01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:06.600]  commission and they said unanimously no
[01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:10.680]  he can run uh... your election but then we looked at past rulings in other
[01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:14.120]  states they've always said someone has to recuse themselves
[01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:19.320]  if they're the state's head election official uh... and and are running
[01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:22.840]  uh... i mean again it just shows how
[01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:25.880]  every form of common sense and checks and balances
[01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:29.720]  are being removed and when you have a real constitutionalist running for an
[01:41:29.720 --> 01:41:33.320]  office income the republican party to try to destroy them
[01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:38.600]  they they fear someone like ran poll just as much as they fear his father run
[01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:43.320]  poll because of their utter fidelity to the constitution and to the natural
[01:41:43.320 --> 01:41:45.880]  law and to the belief that the individual
[01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:48.520]  is greater than the greater than the government
[01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:52.440]  even in my home state of new jersey notorious
[01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:57.000]  for corruptions and political prosecutions it is against the law
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:01.480]  for the collector of the ballots to be on the ballot when he's collecting them
[01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:05.560]  it's almost inconceivable that this could be happening in kentucky right
[01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:10.200]  underneath our noses and the courts won't uh... won't interfere with it
[01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:13.880]  listen i'm i i think that ran paul will win the primary
[01:42:13.880 --> 01:42:18.280]  and will win the election and will be an unbelievable asset in the united
[01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:21.800]  state senate in spite of this i can't advise him as to whether or not he
[01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:25.240]  should file a lawsuit candidly i don't think he needs to do so
[01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:28.600]  but but there's a general principle of law that if
[01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:33.000]  the government's behavior appears to be in a conflict
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:36.520]  then the person that is creating the appearance of a conflict
[01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:39.560]  should step back this guy can run against ran paul
[01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:43.480]  or this guy can count the votes in the election that ran paul is running in
[01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:46.600]  but nobody in their right mind would say that he could do both
[01:42:46.600 --> 01:42:50.760]  at the same time and be absolutely honest that's too much of a temptation
[01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:54.360]  for a human being to have to endure and for the electorate to have to
[01:42:54.360 --> 01:42:58.360]  abide by well i mean you've got all the election officials under him
[01:42:58.360 --> 01:43:01.640]  that are being promised jobs in the u.s senate absolutely they're all political
[01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:05.800]  appointees alex so he can take them to well he's not going to go to the senate
[01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:09.000]  but he can promise to take them to the senate with him
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:13.240]  so will they look the other way when a when a group of absentee ballots
[01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:17.560]  suddenly disappears into the river or suddenly shows up in somebody's trunk
[01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:23.400]  this will force dr paul ran paul to hire more poll watchers to hire more people
[01:43:23.400 --> 01:43:26.920]  to watch the government because the government cannot be trusted
[01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:30.760]  to run an honest election because the guy running the election
[01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:35.320]  is running against ran paul this is just absurd
[01:43:35.320 --> 01:43:39.880]  well i mean if this precedent gets set this new corrupt precedent
[01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:42.520]  pretty soon the only people that can get elected anywhere
[01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:46.520]  will be the head of elections suddenly that'll be the only person that can run
[01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:49.880]  and win and then they'll become kings and their
[01:43:49.880 --> 01:43:53.560]  kids will be the only ones that can win sort of like alexander hamilton when
[01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:56.440]  he wanted george washington to be a king you know what i think will happen
[01:43:56.440 --> 01:44:01.240]  ran paul wins by such a large number that all of their sneaking and trickery
[01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:05.880]  will not be enough to affect the outcome and this collector of ballots who also
[01:44:05.880 --> 01:44:09.800]  wants to be on the senate will be relegated to the dustbin of history
[01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:13.880]  where he belongs well we're already running out of time it's always amazing
[01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:17.800]  having and we got 15 minutes left here i want to get into the book
[01:44:17.800 --> 01:44:23.320]  lies the government told you but first specifically the democrats and and
[01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:26.760]  lindsey graham the republicans they all know
[01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:30.120]  that carbon dioxide isn't bad they all know that china
[01:44:30.120 --> 01:44:34.520]  isn't going to make the cuts they all know that this will industrial
[01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:38.680]  uh be industrial suicide and we have all these big environmentalists
[01:44:38.680 --> 01:44:42.600]  saying they want to destroy our economy why does government
[01:44:42.600 --> 01:44:47.720]  want to destroy the economy government wants to control us
[01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:51.720]  because of what's saying agustin called libido dominante look we all know about
[01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:55.560]  certain types of libido this is a lust for power
[01:44:55.560 --> 01:45:00.600]  before the civil war we sent people to our state houses and to congress
[01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:05.240]  who were interested in liberty who were concerned with confining the government
[01:45:05.240 --> 01:45:09.160]  with assuring that it did not appear will interfere with our natural rights
[01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:11.560]  with our civil liberties and with our property rights
[01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:15.480]  since the civil war we have sent people to the government by and large there
[01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:18.280]  are exceptions both before the civil war and afterwards
[01:45:18.280 --> 01:45:21.640]  but by and large people who are not interested in liberty but people who are
[01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:24.760]  interested in power power for its own sake
[01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:28.440]  power in and of itself power to control other people
[01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:32.040]  government attracts those who lust for power
[01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:37.000]  ron paul and rand paul and ron paul's colleagues in the house
[01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.880]  and if there are any in the senate i'm unaware of them
[01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:44.360]  are the exception to the rule but for the most part this is the type of human
[01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:49.400]  being that the government attracts and this type of illicit
[01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:53.240]  aggregation of power gets worse and worse and worse because
[01:45:53.240 --> 01:45:56.040]  when they get power they hand it off to their successors
[01:45:56.040 --> 01:45:59.960]  just like mike churtoff handed it off to janet napolitano and i know what
[01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:03.560]  you're thinking the answer is no we are not related
[01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:09.400]  this happens generation after generation after generation that's why i am not
[01:46:09.400 --> 01:46:13.240]  optimistic about our future because it will take a generation
[01:46:13.240 --> 01:46:18.920]  of doctors paul to change this to stop it to reverse it
[01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:21.720]  well that's what g ever griffin and others have said though we have to have
[01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:24.920]  the long view of history we're not going to beat these people overnight
[01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:28.120]  we've got to do everything we can and start resisting now
[01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:32.200]  just to slow it down and then stop it and then start
[01:46:32.200 --> 01:46:36.760]  reversing it but the good news is this is really open people's eyes up the
[01:46:36.760 --> 01:46:41.160]  carbon taxes the open borders uh the takeover of the health care bill
[01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:45.400]  the fact that it is just pure robbery not even you know benevolent socialism
[01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:49.720]  which which is an oxymoron uh do you agree though that the
[01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:54.120]  battle lines are now drawn and that the awakening is exploding
[01:46:54.120 --> 01:46:59.080]  i do and i believe that the the great mass of independent voters are on the
[01:46:59.080 --> 01:47:02.760]  side of liberty in this i believe that the average man
[01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:05.720]  and woman who accepted the government for what it was
[01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:09.000]  now fear it and now need to understand
[01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:12.360]  that they can change it when i told a crowd in florida the other night
[01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:16.280]  that that we have the power to abolish the irs the place went
[01:47:16.280 --> 01:47:20.200]  wild with enthusiasm and a couple people said to me
[01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:23.640]  i didn't know that i thought it was in the constitution i thought we had to
[01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:27.720]  have income taxes we have the power if we work hard enough
[01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:32.440]  and educate ourselves to throw the yoke of tyranny off of us
[01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:35.720]  okay judge judge i'm gonna give you the floor
[01:47:35.720 --> 01:47:40.280]  for the last 12 minutes and we're going to skip this network break coming up
[01:47:40.280 --> 01:47:43.640]  i'm going to sit back and i want you to give us a speech or rant
[01:47:43.640 --> 01:47:47.400]  cover the book any issues you want to cover and i'll say bye to you because
[01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:50.440]  i always get so intrigued and i want to back up what you're saying i'm always
[01:47:50.440 --> 01:47:52.600]  adding things i want at the end of the interview
[01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:57.000]  shut up but before we do that i want to encourage viewers to support this radio
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:00.200]  show to support our films we have two new films coming out
[01:48:00.200 --> 01:48:04.600]  in the middle of april order them at info wars dot com invisible empire
[01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:07.800]  a new world order defined and police state for
[01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:12.200]  the rise of female you'll also see them premiere at prison planet dot tv and
[01:48:12.200 --> 01:48:15.800]  super high quality but go by the dvds make copies
[01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:18.840]  give them everyone you know because one of the most effective things
[01:48:18.840 --> 01:48:24.600]  that we have ever done is these films and this unlocks people's minds it shows
[01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:27.240]  them the predatory nature of this global elite
[01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:31.240]  please go to info wars dot com purchase the books the videos the materials
[01:48:31.240 --> 01:48:34.200]  because they're key tools to wake your friends and family up
[01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:38.200]  and it supports this broadcast now the the only caveat of proviso i'm going to
[01:48:38.200 --> 01:48:41.080]  sit back and shut up judge is before you get into the book
[01:48:41.080 --> 01:48:44.120]  and taxes and the nature of slavery and bondage and we
[01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:48.280]  what we're truly going under global government is openly being announced
[01:48:48.280 --> 01:48:51.400]  why do you think they're finally admitting that okay it's a world
[01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:55.960]  government it's going to be run by banks and what is the nature of this world
[01:48:55.960 --> 01:48:59.400]  government from your research and then tie that in
[01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:03.800]  uh to the overarching system of why they want a global government so no one
[01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:07.480]  can run and flee and set up societies that are free
[01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:11.480]  because then that competes with the collectivist and outshines them
[01:49:11.480 --> 01:49:15.240]  in every case so speak to that and then you've got the floor in the last 11
[01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:19.160]  minutes on any issue you want to cover oh you are so kind and so generous to me
[01:49:19.160 --> 01:49:22.040]  alex and i'm deeply grateful uh to be here look i'm
[01:49:22.040 --> 01:49:26.040]  just a simple night watchman that's employed by fox my job is to watch the
[01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:29.560]  government in the nighttime when it doesn't think that people are watching
[01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:31.800]  it and doesn't want people to look at it
[01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:36.200]  to see what it is doing to steal our freedom and to steal our property the
[01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:39.560]  one world government has been around since the progressive era
[01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:43.800]  and you're right alex these people are enormously patient
[01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:47.880]  obviously the people who came up with this concept are no longer with us but
[01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:51.000]  their successors are they are wealthier they are more
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:54.120]  sophisticated and they are just as committed as their
[01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:58.600]  predecessors were they simply want control they want power
[01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:04.440]  for the the the joy of exercising power in and of itself power corrupts
[01:50:04.440 --> 01:50:08.920]  absolute power corrupts absolutely they don't want to have to answer to voters
[01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:13.000]  they don't want to have to answer to a constitution that limits their behavior
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:16.440]  they want to be able to take whatever property they can whether they call it
[01:50:16.440 --> 01:50:19.880]  eminent domain whatever they want to call the process by which
[01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:24.200]  they take it they want to protect us cradle to grave
[01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:28.040]  so that we are totally dependent upon them for everything
[01:50:28.040 --> 01:50:31.320]  so they can decide who will be in their group and who won't
[01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:37.400]  if you read george orwell's 1984 he was just off by a couple of years but
[01:50:37.400 --> 01:50:41.320]  almost everything that was in there was predicted
[01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:48.600]  and we see it now the use of law to assault liberty and to steal property
[01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:53.560]  do you remember alex studying basic american history the king of england
[01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:58.840]  had ingenious ways to taxis the last straw was the stamp
[01:50:58.840 --> 01:51:01.720]  act it required that every colonist have
[01:51:01.720 --> 01:51:04.840]  on every piece of paper in his or her home a stamp
[01:51:04.840 --> 01:51:09.160]  every book every bank draft every mortgage every lease every deed every
[01:51:09.160 --> 01:51:12.520]  pamphlet even a poster that was going to be nailed to a tree
[01:51:12.520 --> 01:51:16.760]  had to have the king stamp on it imagine having to go yet we have enough
[01:51:16.760 --> 01:51:19.960]  difficulties with the post office as it is you had to go to a foreign post
[01:51:19.960 --> 01:51:23.240]  office in the colonies and by the king stamp question
[01:51:23.240 --> 01:51:27.480]  how did the government know if you had the king stamp on every piece of paper
[01:51:27.480 --> 01:51:31.000]  in your house answer the parliament enacted the towns and
[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:35.160]  acts which permitted british soldiers to write their own search warrants
[01:51:35.160 --> 01:51:38.920]  and thus they would show up at your home and hand you a piece of paper
[01:51:38.920 --> 01:51:42.520]  on which they had purported to authorize themselves to enter your home
[01:51:42.520 --> 01:51:46.600]  ostensibly to look for the stamps of course they would confiscate alcohol
[01:51:46.600 --> 01:51:49.800]  they would confiscate furniture which you couldn't demonstrate you had paid
[01:51:49.800 --> 01:51:52.600]  taxes on they would even sometimes kick you out of the
[01:51:52.600 --> 01:51:56.200]  house and take it over for days or weeks or months
[01:51:56.200 --> 01:51:59.480]  we fought a revolution we won the revolution
[01:51:59.480 --> 01:52:04.440]  we wrote a constitution we added the fourth amendment to that constitution
[01:52:04.440 --> 01:52:09.160]  which next to the right to life is the greatest right there is the right to be
[01:52:09.160 --> 01:52:12.280]  left alone and it says the government can't come
[01:52:12.280 --> 01:52:15.240]  onto your property and can't seize what you have
[01:52:15.240 --> 01:52:18.600]  and can't intrude into your privacy unless it goes to a judge
[01:52:18.600 --> 01:52:22.120]  and demonstrates to a neutral judge that it is more likely than not that you are
[01:52:22.120 --> 01:52:25.720]  committing crime fast forward 200 years to the
[01:52:25.720 --> 01:52:29.240]  patriot act what does the patriot act do it allows
[01:52:29.240 --> 01:52:33.880]  federal agents to write their own search warrants
[01:52:33.880 --> 01:52:38.760]  we have elected a government that has done the very same thing to us
[01:52:38.760 --> 01:52:44.840]  which was the last straw when we broke away from an island
[01:52:44.840 --> 01:52:50.360]  3 000 miles away that was regulating us as if we were chattel and as if we were
[01:52:50.360 --> 01:52:54.200]  slaves to them when jefferson wrote in the in the declaration of
[01:52:54.200 --> 01:52:58.440]  independence the words that every school child knows alex by heart
[01:52:58.440 --> 01:53:01.720]  all men are created equal and endowed by their creator
[01:53:01.720 --> 01:53:06.520]  with certain inalienable rights and that among these is life liberty and the
[01:53:06.520 --> 01:53:11.160]  pursuit of happiness he wedded the american soul
[01:53:11.160 --> 01:53:15.720]  to the idea of the natural law that our rights come from nature from our
[01:53:15.720 --> 01:53:20.040]  humanity that we are created in the image and likeness of god and as he is
[01:53:20.040 --> 01:53:24.600]  perfectly free he has given us the gift of perfect freedom
[01:53:24.600 --> 01:53:30.600]  in philadelphia in 1787 when they argued all summer about how the government
[01:53:30.600 --> 01:53:33.240]  should look and what the constitution should be
[01:53:33.240 --> 01:53:36.760]  they began with an argument about what is the source of our rights
[01:53:36.760 --> 01:53:40.600]  and alexander hamilton the big government guy of the day
[01:53:40.600 --> 01:53:44.360]  the guy who said debt was good even in 1787
[01:53:44.360 --> 01:53:47.720]  argued that without the government there can be no rights
[01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:50.840]  and the same government that gives rights can take them away
[01:53:50.840 --> 01:53:54.760]  madison repute refuted him toe to toe point to point
[01:53:54.760 --> 01:53:58.760]  and said our rights come from our humanity madison won
[01:53:58.760 --> 01:54:03.000]  read the first amendment it doesn't say congress shall grant
[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:06.840]  freedom of speech it says congress shall make no law
[01:54:06.840 --> 01:54:11.560]  abridging the freedom of speech why do i emphasize the word the
[01:54:11.560 --> 01:54:15.240]  because the framers recognized that freedom of speech
[01:54:15.240 --> 01:54:18.840]  pre-existed the government pre-existed the country
[01:54:18.840 --> 01:54:23.080]  came by virtue of our birth and the purpose of the first amendment
[01:54:23.080 --> 01:54:26.600]  was to assure that congress and ultimately the president and
[01:54:26.600 --> 01:54:31.320]  eventually the courts and one day the states could not interfere
[01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:35.160]  with the basic freedoms the right to think as you wish
[01:54:35.160 --> 01:54:38.920]  the right to say what you think the right to publish what you say the right
[01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:43.560]  to worship or not to worship the right to come and go as you see fit
[01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:46.760]  the right to petition the government for a redress of grievances
[01:54:46.760 --> 01:54:50.280]  the right to defend yourself alex by any
[01:54:50.280 --> 01:54:53.960]  technologically advanced means that are available
[01:54:53.960 --> 01:54:57.720]  at any given time which includes the right to shoot
[01:54:57.720 --> 01:55:01.160]  at the government when it is taken over by tyrants
[01:55:01.160 --> 01:55:04.920]  and then of course the right to be left alone in the fourth amendment all of
[01:55:04.920 --> 01:55:09.160]  these rights are natural to us and every person in the
[01:55:09.160 --> 01:55:12.600]  government takes an oath to uphold the constitution
[01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:17.080]  meaning upholding the inviolability of these rights
[01:55:17.080 --> 01:55:21.160]  but in my years on the bench and i write about this uh in the book
[01:55:21.160 --> 01:55:24.120]  every time the government was in front of me alex
[01:55:24.120 --> 01:55:28.200]  it wasn't to enforce the constitution it wasn't to protect
[01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:31.480]  someone's rights it was to find some sneaky or
[01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:35.960]  ingenious way to get around the constitution
[01:55:35.960 --> 01:55:42.280]  but claim that they were enforcing it now my new book and i'm i'm very happy
[01:55:42.280 --> 01:55:47.160]  to tell you that as of a few minutes ago it's number 13 on the new york times
[01:55:47.160 --> 01:55:50.920]  bestseller bestseller list that doesn't mean the times approves of the book
[01:55:50.920 --> 01:55:55.720]  hardly it means that the most public counter of book sales
[01:55:55.720 --> 01:55:59.080]  is ranking me number 13 which is very good because then it gets published in
[01:55:59.080 --> 01:56:02.440]  that list and a lot of folks that don't watch fox or
[01:56:02.440 --> 01:56:07.640]  listen to alex jones or don't know me uh will be exposed to the book the book
[01:56:07.640 --> 01:56:11.960]  posits the following why do we expect that the government
[01:56:11.960 --> 01:56:15.320]  will lie why do we know that the government lies
[01:56:15.320 --> 01:56:19.560]  and do nothing about it would linden johnson have beaten barry goldwater in
[01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:22.360]  64 if we knew that he was secretly planning
[01:56:22.360 --> 01:56:25.960]  to invade north vietnam as he accused goldwater of doing
[01:56:25.960 --> 01:56:30.360]  would fdr have been elected in 44 re-elected in 44 if the public had
[01:56:30.360 --> 01:56:34.520]  known that he caused pearl harbor because he needed an excuse
[01:56:34.520 --> 01:56:39.720]  to enter world war two would george w bush have been re-elected in 2004
[01:56:39.720 --> 01:56:43.080]  if people knew that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq and
[01:56:43.080 --> 01:56:46.360]  that he knew it and ought to have known it that he was torturing people and
[01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:49.640]  lying about it that he was listening to people's phone calls and capturing
[01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:53.800]  their computer strokes all in violation of federal law
[01:56:53.800 --> 01:56:58.760]  that's what the book challenges americans alex to be aware of to recognize
[01:56:58.760 --> 01:57:04.840]  to reject and to correct my dear friend i've enjoyed all my time with you
[01:57:04.840 --> 01:57:10.040]  and in closing why do we put up with the line why have we gotten to a point
[01:57:10.040 --> 01:57:14.680]  where it's just accepted they lie but then that 20 percent that supports the
[01:57:14.680 --> 01:57:18.440]  government health bills still believe they're getting something free
[01:57:18.440 --> 01:57:24.120]  and the system is going for broke because they passed the point of no return
[01:57:24.120 --> 01:57:28.040]  they have committed so many crimes they're so lawless they've stolen so much
[01:57:28.040 --> 01:57:31.880]  they know the country's going bankrupt bloomberg reports the feds are openly
[01:57:31.880 --> 01:57:35.960]  getting ready to take pension funds to fund their operations and to fund the
[01:57:35.960 --> 01:57:40.440]  banks they have decided to go all the way just like hitler or
[01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:44.520]  stalin or mal and it's time for the public to wake up i mean you mentioned

[02:00:23.320 --> 02:00:28.600]  continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security
[02:00:28.600 --> 02:00:32.360]  objectives that we've set we've got to have a civilian national
[02:00:32.360 --> 02:00:36.520]  security force that's just as powerful just as strong
[02:00:36.520 --> 02:00:39.640]  just as well funded
[02:00:39.640 --> 02:00:45.080]  president obama and his chief of staff rama manual
[02:00:45.080 --> 02:00:49.560]  have repeatedly stated on the record that all americans below the age of 64
[02:00:49.560 --> 02:00:53.240]  will be forcibly conscripted into federal service
[02:00:53.240 --> 02:00:58.200]  citizenship is not an entitlement program it comes with responsibilities
[02:00:58.200 --> 02:01:01.800]  everybody somewhere between the ages of 1825 will serve three months of basic
[02:01:01.800 --> 02:01:05.320]  training and understanding in a kind of civil defense
[02:01:05.320 --> 02:01:10.040]  now it doesn't always have to be uh service in uniform one of the things
[02:01:10.040 --> 02:01:14.040]  that if you talk to our generals they are desperate for
[02:01:14.040 --> 02:01:20.040]  is a civilian counterpart to our military forces so is this compulsory
[02:01:20.040 --> 02:01:23.480]  then well you have to uh in the sense is it's a
[02:01:23.480 --> 02:01:27.400]  required of everybody 18 to 25 three months
[02:01:27.400 --> 02:01:30.600]  uh and at some point at that point you do it
[02:01:30.600 --> 02:01:34.040]  obviously i'm like i said perfect legislation will work that process
[02:01:34.040 --> 02:01:37.640]  through you can do it during a college summer or you can do it after high school
[02:01:37.640 --> 02:01:42.280]  if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[02:01:42.280 --> 02:01:45.960]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme
[02:01:45.960 --> 02:01:49.640]  bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascism
[02:01:49.640 --> 02:01:53.640]  obama's transition site change.gov proclaimed
[02:01:53.640 --> 02:01:57.080]  that middle school and high school students will be forced to serve the
[02:01:57.080 --> 02:02:00.280]  federal government
[02:02:00.280 --> 02:02:05.640]  fascism is gutter up streets up hooligans thugs
[02:02:05.640 --> 02:02:08.600]  permanently idealistic students swarming adolescents
[02:02:08.600 --> 02:02:12.840]  just the kind of thing you see around obama the way you get a population to
[02:02:12.840 --> 02:02:15.880]  enslave itself when the police and the army
[02:02:15.880 --> 02:02:19.720]  are no longer enough to do that so i think that's that's uh
[02:02:19.720 --> 02:02:23.400]  if you're a left liberal uh it's time to open your eyes to that
[02:02:23.400 --> 02:02:27.320]  all young americans between the ages of 18 and 24
[02:02:27.320 --> 02:02:31.640]  will be conscripted into a paramilitary domestic security force
[02:02:31.640 --> 02:02:37.400]  if obama has his way adults and seniors will also be forced into other forms of
[02:02:37.400 --> 02:02:41.960]  service for the betterment of the homeland
[02:02:43.400 --> 02:02:47.080]  number three disarming the american people
[02:02:47.080 --> 02:02:51.080]  obama operatives in the congress have introduced more than 10 bills
[02:02:51.080 --> 02:02:54.120]  that would end the second amendment as we know it
[02:02:54.120 --> 02:02:58.200]  hr 1022 would allow the new attorney general eric holder
[02:02:58.200 --> 02:03:03.320]  the dictatorial power to ban any gun he wishes at will
[02:03:03.320 --> 02:03:08.120]  in 2008 before the supreme court in the dc gun ban case
[02:03:08.120 --> 02:03:13.000]  district of columbia versus heller holder argued for the complete disarmament
[02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:17.480]  of the american people and that only the military should own firearms
[02:03:17.480 --> 02:03:21.160]  hr 257 would ban all youth shooting sports
[02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:26.040]  including ymca and youth olympic shooting clubs
[02:03:26.040 --> 02:03:31.560]  hr 45 would force all gun owners to undergo federal psychological screening
[02:03:31.560 --> 02:03:36.360]  registration and testing to keep their firearms
[02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:41.400]  white house chief of staff rama manual has proposed the extra judicial banning
[02:03:41.400 --> 02:03:46.200]  of any american on the fraudulent no fly list from owning any firearm
[02:03:46.200 --> 02:03:50.200]  that is if you are on the no fly list because you are known
[02:03:50.200 --> 02:03:58.760]  as maybe a possible terrorist you cannot buy a handgun in america
[02:03:58.760 --> 02:04:03.240]  over 25 000 americans are added each month to the no fly list
[02:04:03.240 --> 02:04:07.400]  which numbers over a million people who have not been charged or convicted
[02:04:07.400 --> 02:04:13.400]  of any crime it's a case of mistaken identity for a five-year-old boy from
[02:04:13.400 --> 02:04:16.600]  normandy park he had trouble boarding a plane because
[02:04:16.600 --> 02:04:20.520]  someone with his same name is wanted by the federal government king five's

[02:08:13.080 --> 02:08:18.360]  i'm gonna get into the bill that obama signed versus what's happening
[02:08:18.360 --> 02:08:23.560]  right now in the senate and try to break that down other nightmare
[02:08:23.560 --> 02:08:27.960]  provisions we've now found in the bill it just gets worse by the day
[02:08:27.960 --> 02:08:32.280]  i'm trying to wade through this 2,700 pages i see other breakdowns of it i go
[02:08:32.280 --> 02:08:35.400]  double check what the media is saying if it's accurate or not
[02:08:35.400 --> 02:08:38.840]  this bill was even worse than we originally thought if that is possible
[02:08:38.840 --> 02:08:42.920]  there's loopholes exempting washington insiders from obama care mandate
[02:08:42.920 --> 02:08:47.880]  i've got a bunch of amazing police state news that we need to go over as well and
[02:08:47.880 --> 02:08:52.440]  i want to talk about these brinks commercials
[02:08:52.440 --> 02:08:56.520]  for a segment or so in the last hour today because i don't watch a lot of tv but
[02:08:56.520 --> 02:09:01.320]  we have tv on's in a few different office areas to monitor things
[02:09:01.320 --> 02:09:05.240]  here in our studios and i see these brinks commercials where
[02:09:05.240 --> 02:09:09.080]  a woman's having a party everybody's leaving the party
[02:09:09.080 --> 02:09:13.240]  and her girlfriends are saying who is this guy oh we don't know
[02:09:13.240 --> 02:09:17.800]  and as soon as she locks the door he comes hatefully and knocks the window in
[02:09:17.800 --> 02:09:21.320]  and then the alarm goes off and so that makes him run away
[02:09:21.320 --> 02:09:28.120]  and then she calls 911 well matt ryan here in my office
[02:09:28.120 --> 02:09:32.920]  with one of his family members over the weekend
[02:09:32.920 --> 02:09:36.840]  they had somebody calling up some of his relatives threatening to come attack
[02:09:36.840 --> 02:09:39.560]  him this guy had been convicted multiple times
[02:09:39.560 --> 02:09:43.160]  of attacking people they called the police five times
[02:09:43.160 --> 02:09:46.520]  over several hours he was coming to sing i'm coming to get you i'm coming to
[02:09:46.520 --> 02:09:50.440]  hurt you i'm coming to and he came beat a woman up with
[02:09:50.440 --> 02:09:53.480]  a chain
[02:09:53.560 --> 02:09:57.480]  beat her bloody and then the police showed up
[02:09:57.480 --> 02:10:01.720]  and i made the point well why didn't your relatives
[02:10:01.720 --> 02:10:06.440]  have a gun well they were scared of guns and it's because of the media i see
[02:10:06.440 --> 02:10:10.120]  these images on the news of when somebody's
[02:10:10.120 --> 02:10:15.240]  breaking in your house you call 911 the cops under federal and state rulings
[02:10:15.240 --> 02:10:19.640]  literally thousands of times it's more than a couple thousand
[02:10:19.640 --> 02:10:23.560]  just in the state of texas it has been found that
[02:10:23.560 --> 02:10:27.560]  they have no liability to protect you and conversely
[02:10:27.560 --> 02:10:30.440]  they have no right to keep you from protecting yourself and most police
[02:10:30.440 --> 02:10:34.120]  understand that but the bureaucrats want you disarmed and in
[02:10:34.120 --> 02:10:37.720]  england if you stab an intruder or even beat him up or one guy
[02:10:37.720 --> 02:10:42.200]  threw a guy through a second door window and he broke his legs and then
[02:10:42.200 --> 02:10:46.280]  the police arrested the homeowner that defended themselves
[02:10:46.280 --> 02:10:51.160]  they want you domesticated servile on your back they want the instinct for
[02:10:51.160 --> 02:10:54.440]  you to take action and protect yourself to be
[02:10:54.440 --> 02:10:58.520]  extinguished every few days i see articles in england canada the us and
[02:10:58.520 --> 02:11:01.880]  other western nations where a young woman will be
[02:11:01.880 --> 02:11:06.120]  stabbed on a busy street and bleed to death over four hours
[02:11:06.120 --> 02:11:10.440]  or a woman will be beaten with a lead pipe in toronto on a busy street
[02:11:10.440 --> 02:11:14.600]  and office workers laughed at her naked body for hours and didn't even call the
[02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:18.040]  cops or in a case a few years ago an austin cop
[02:11:18.040 --> 02:11:23.560]  at the corner of i-35 and william cannon was hit by a car
[02:11:23.560 --> 02:11:26.680]  and laid bleeding to death in a pile of fire ants
[02:11:26.680 --> 02:11:31.080]  for over an hour and no one called the police
[02:11:31.080 --> 02:11:40.760]  so this domestication i've told the story about six seven years ago
[02:11:40.760 --> 02:11:45.000]  i was at a metaline restaurant
[02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:50.920]  and i went to the bathroom and when i came out there was a big
[02:11:50.920 --> 02:11:55.080]  commotion a few tables over where my wife and son were
[02:11:55.080 --> 02:11:58.200]  my toddler son what even a toddler he was tiny
[02:11:58.200 --> 02:12:01.320]  and i said what's going on this big crowd of about 20 people
[02:12:01.320 --> 02:12:04.600]  and they said she's choking call 911 everybody had their cell phones out
[02:12:04.600 --> 02:12:07.880]  calling 911 and i said well here let me do the heimlich maneuver and they
[02:12:07.880 --> 02:12:11.000]  almost fought me they're like wait a minute buddy well you
[02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:15.160]  know wait don't you know wait for the police
[02:12:15.160 --> 02:12:18.120]  and i started yelling at him she'll be dead in four minutes
[02:12:18.120 --> 02:12:22.520]  and i had to actually shove people out of the way and they were getting angry
[02:12:22.520 --> 02:12:26.360]  and i had to get on over her get my hands around her to the heimlich and a
[02:12:26.360 --> 02:12:30.040]  big piece of bread came out she was purple she was starting to collapse on
[02:12:30.040 --> 02:12:33.960]  the table and i talk a lot about this because
[02:12:33.960 --> 02:12:39.480]  this is why we're slaves this is why we're in so much trouble for me
[02:12:39.480 --> 02:12:44.360]  if i know the heimlich maneuver they gave us a half day course on swim team
[02:12:44.360 --> 02:12:48.520]  and i when i was like 12 years old if i know the heimlich maneuver on an adult
[02:12:48.520 --> 02:12:55.080]  or a baby if i know cpr i'm not going to call 911
[02:12:55.080 --> 02:12:58.840]  and the police will try to show up the fire department and the ems will try to
[02:12:58.840 --> 02:13:01.800]  show up but i see these cases now in the news every
[02:13:01.800 --> 02:13:05.000]  few days where people stand and watch someone bleed to death they don't put a
[02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:09.160]  tourniquet on some guy's leg it's been chopped off in a construction accident
[02:13:09.160 --> 02:13:11.800]  they don't help an old lady who's just been mugged
[02:13:11.800 --> 02:13:15.640]  they don't want to get involved they're narcissistic they're selfish and they
[02:13:15.640 --> 02:13:20.280]  don't see themselves in the position as taking action
[02:13:20.280 --> 02:13:26.840]  they see themselves as drones or spectators in society so i'm going to
[02:13:26.840 --> 02:13:29.720]  talk about this with matt ryan for about 20 minutes or so
[02:13:29.720 --> 02:13:32.440]  coming up the next hour after we take calls and cover
[02:13:32.440 --> 02:13:37.000]  other important news but um
[02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:41.160]  i watch these brinks commercials which are conditioning
[02:13:41.160 --> 02:13:44.600]  where over and over again it shows the evil man coming
[02:13:44.600 --> 02:13:48.760]  and trying to hurt you and the women you know the ad should be for smith and
[02:13:48.760 --> 02:13:51.320]  wesson and show the woman shooting him
[02:13:51.320 --> 02:13:54.360]  smith and wesson by the way would sell millions of guns and the good news is a
[02:13:54.360 --> 02:13:57.640]  lot of women are figuring this out and they're actually out buying guns i mean
[02:13:57.640 --> 02:14:00.920]  i have two daughters and you know one of them's five she's already
[02:14:00.920 --> 02:14:04.680]  learned how to shoot the two-year-old you know she's not old enough yet
[02:14:04.680 --> 02:14:08.360]  but when my daughters go away to college or go to way to get married or
[02:14:08.360 --> 02:14:12.040]  or or to work in another city they're going to go to a city where there's
[02:14:12.040 --> 02:14:15.640]  still a second amendment if we still have it uh or they're going to end up
[02:14:15.640 --> 02:14:19.720]  illegally owning guns even with their band my daughters aren't and my son
[02:14:19.720 --> 02:14:23.320]  aren't going to sit in their apartments of their houses waiting
[02:14:23.320 --> 02:14:28.280]  to be raped or robbed waiting to be hogtied and tortured
[02:14:28.280 --> 02:14:33.560]  and it's so fundamental because i'm not domesticated i'm a wild human
[02:14:33.560 --> 02:14:37.880]  i have my instincts i have my common sense and i don't know how women out
[02:14:37.880 --> 02:14:42.360]  there and men have been trained
[02:14:42.360 --> 02:14:49.000]  to somebody calls and says i'm coming over there to attack you
[02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:53.720]  they wouldn't come if they knew you had a gun number one and i wouldn't go out
[02:14:53.720 --> 02:14:56.280]  and look for trouble but if somebody i'd let them you know start banging on the
[02:14:56.280 --> 02:14:58.920]  door and i'd get down on my knees at the end of the
[02:14:58.920 --> 02:15:01.800]  hall waiting and as soon as that door busted open
[02:15:01.800 --> 02:15:05.800]  i'm going to unload every round right into them
[02:15:05.800 --> 02:15:08.920]  but it's the same attitude of not getting involved in politics not getting
[02:15:08.920 --> 02:15:11.560]  informed not knowing your congressman's voting record
[02:15:11.560 --> 02:15:14.600]  not standing up against tyranny not going to town hall meetings and shouting
[02:15:14.600 --> 02:15:19.080]  these scum down it's this attitude that somebody else
[02:15:19.080 --> 02:15:22.040]  i mean i get thousands of emails every year literally thousands
[02:15:22.040 --> 02:15:25.160]  and hundreds of phone calls you've heard them on air saying i'm glad you're
[02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:27.880]  there doing this for us i'm glad you're there i could sleep
[02:15:27.880 --> 02:15:31.880]  better at night what do you mean you know this information
[02:15:31.880 --> 02:15:34.840]  and some of you aren't taking action because you think
[02:15:34.840 --> 02:15:37.960]  i'm going to fix it
[02:15:39.640 --> 02:15:43.560]  what has happened to people that they would sit there and gerald salenty told
[02:15:43.560 --> 02:15:47.560]  the same story how he said is there a doctor in the house first
[02:15:47.560 --> 02:15:50.120]  and uh... and no one in the restaurant said there's a doctor in the house a
[02:15:50.120 --> 02:15:52.520]  packed restaurant then he found out after the fact
[02:15:52.520 --> 02:15:58.040]  there was a doctor but they didn't want to get involved
[02:15:58.040 --> 02:16:00.920]  but then meanwhile there are some people who want to get involved and the
[02:16:00.920 --> 02:16:06.440]  government recruits them who mean well to be tattletales to be spies
[02:16:06.440 --> 02:16:13.720]  everything is a counterfeit everything is twisted around backwards
[02:16:13.720 --> 02:16:17.720]  and people have been made to believe that some specialist a cop
[02:16:17.720 --> 02:16:21.000]  or an emt or somebody else is going to be there for him
[02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:25.080]  the police on average take twelve minutes
[02:16:25.080 --> 02:16:29.880]  in fact that's a few years old google uh... average nine one one
[02:16:29.880 --> 02:16:34.280]  national average national nine one one average police response time i
[02:16:34.280 --> 02:16:38.040]  last time i saw it was twelve minutes thirty something seconds but
[02:16:38.040 --> 02:16:43.400]  it may have changed the point is that in twelve minutes anything could happen
[02:16:43.400 --> 02:16:47.880]  and the police may be tied down in other events and they can't make it
[02:16:47.880 --> 02:16:51.560]  you know the more police we get the more crime we have look at chicago look at
[02:16:51.560 --> 02:16:54.440]  new york more police than any other cities in the country
[02:16:54.440 --> 02:16:58.840]  more crime all right i'm done ranting about this i said i'd cover
[02:16:58.840 --> 02:17:03.800]  next hour i'm already getting it now they say six minutes
[02:17:03.800 --> 02:17:07.640]  i wonder what source that's from though because the
[02:17:07.640 --> 02:17:11.880]  six minutes to live or die the price of just a few seconds lost
[02:17:11.880 --> 02:17:16.680]  people die that's u.s.a. today most of the numbers i've seen are over 10
[02:17:16.680 --> 02:17:21.560]  minutes but okay six minutes six minutes ladies and gentlemen
[02:17:21.560 --> 02:17:26.840]  you've got seconds everybody needs to buy guns you need to take shooting
[02:17:26.840 --> 02:17:30.920]  lessons you need an instant access pistol safe you just go through
[02:17:30.920 --> 02:17:34.440]  the drawer pops open if you have children in the house you want to
[02:17:34.440 --> 02:17:37.880]  you want the gun safe you don't have children have it in a drawer
[02:17:37.880 --> 02:17:41.800]  and i sleep so good at night when i get death threats
[02:17:41.800 --> 02:17:45.080]  and people saying they're going to come to my house and do things you come to my
[02:17:45.080 --> 02:17:49.480]  house you're dead i'm red-blooded i'm not a slave
[02:17:49.480 --> 02:17:53.080]  i'm not a coward i'm going to defend myself but it's not even being
[02:17:53.080 --> 02:18:00.280]  brave it's self-preservation i mean you can corner a
[02:18:00.280 --> 02:18:04.840]  raccoon and if you try to go and grab it it's going to bite you it's going to
[02:18:04.840 --> 02:18:09.560]  attack you it's vicious you try to corner a dog you try to corner a rat
[02:18:09.560 --> 02:18:14.680]  you try to corner a rabbit it will bite you humans are losing their humanity
[02:18:14.680 --> 02:18:18.520]  we're told to be a bunch of cowardly jellyfish to lay down to anything and
[02:18:18.520 --> 02:18:22.520]  everything and don't get involved and sit on your button watch tv
[02:18:22.520 --> 02:18:25.560]  but meanwhile the specialist in government they're taught to be more
[02:18:25.560 --> 02:18:29.640]  vicious and pain compliance and torture and to attack the citizens and that
[02:18:29.640 --> 02:18:33.720]  it's virtuous so they get more militarized they get more out of control
[02:18:33.720 --> 02:18:37.560]  they get more hateful they're taught we're basically the enemy and then
[02:18:37.560 --> 02:18:41.880]  we're taught not even to defend ourselves stan

[02:24:55.080 --> 02:24:58.280]  security and what i mean by false sense of security
[02:24:58.280 --> 02:25:03.880]  when nothing happened with ytk people were looking at al keppett with 350
[02:25:03.880 --> 02:25:06.520]  thousand foreign troops to come in and take us over and when
[02:25:06.520 --> 02:25:09.480]  nothing happened with this people just gave up alex
[02:25:09.480 --> 02:25:13.400]  they're looking for a red dawn scenario
[02:25:14.120 --> 02:25:19.080]  i agree with you people are looking for a overnight takeover this is a creeping
[02:25:19.080 --> 02:25:22.200]  incremental death
[02:25:22.200 --> 02:25:27.160]  you just don't come into a country and take it over overnight alex you have
[02:25:27.160 --> 02:25:30.840]  you have to implement these plans that they implemented in these foreign lands
[02:25:30.840 --> 02:25:35.080]  like cuba for years i mean castro he might have come in and took over but
[02:25:35.080 --> 02:25:37.240]  they had to implement their brainwashing and
[02:25:37.240 --> 02:25:41.160]  indoctrination centers and all that you had a friend of mine who was a guest on
[02:25:41.160 --> 02:25:44.280]  your show years ago by the name of geoff colon
[02:25:44.280 --> 02:25:47.880]  geoff colon knows what it's like to live under communism alex these people in
[02:25:47.880 --> 02:25:51.000]  this country are spoiled rotten they have no concept what it's like to live
[02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:55.720]  under social disorder we know big government is hellish
[02:25:55.720 --> 02:25:59.080]  and i appreciate your call those that have studied history know that but the
[02:25:59.080 --> 02:26:02.440]  public who don't help people when they're
[02:26:02.440 --> 02:26:05.880]  bleeding on the side of the street don't help women being attacked by thugs
[02:26:05.880 --> 02:26:10.840]  remember well was it more than 10 years ago for a week after week in new york
[02:26:10.840 --> 02:26:17.560]  city and central park hordes of 500 to a thousand men
[02:26:17.560 --> 02:26:20.360]  there were different sized crowds we could pull up that video i bet it's on
[02:26:20.360 --> 02:26:23.480]  youtube rapes in central park fact try to pull it up
[02:26:23.480 --> 02:26:28.280]  and the police i would imagine you'd search it under police refuse to help
[02:26:28.280 --> 02:26:32.120]  women being sexually assaulted in central park that'll pull it up
[02:26:32.120 --> 02:26:35.480]  and the cops would just stand around a circle around the rapers
[02:26:35.480 --> 02:26:39.480]  and let them do it because the cops are drawn from the very same
[02:26:39.480 --> 02:26:48.520]  people that fill up this country and the public just expects somebody else to
[02:26:48.520 --> 02:26:54.360]  save them and they don't know what's about to happen to them
[02:26:54.360 --> 02:26:57.880]  let's talk to darning in oklahoma you're on the air
[02:26:57.880 --> 02:27:03.160]  uh yeah i wanted to talk about um the airport scanning
[02:27:03.160 --> 02:27:09.640]  about three years ago someone who is very close to me who works with tsa
[02:27:09.640 --> 02:27:15.080]  told me that they had a special meeting that they were putting devices in the
[02:27:15.080 --> 02:27:20.200]  headrest of the airplane seats to monitor
[02:27:20.200 --> 02:27:25.400]  brainwaves yes i saw that a few months ago and i forgot to cover it they're
[02:27:25.400 --> 02:27:29.160]  going to have cameras in the airplanes that scan your eyes
[02:27:29.160 --> 02:27:33.160]  that look for aggressive movements again they've proven that lie detectors are
[02:27:33.160 --> 02:27:36.520]  a fraud and now they're just getting fancier quackery
[02:27:36.520 --> 02:27:39.720]  they have mobile homeland security 18 wheeler trailers
[02:27:39.720 --> 02:27:42.680]  that put you in a brain scanner and ask you questions and then say you're
[02:27:42.680 --> 02:27:47.000]  guilty uh and i did see the report of they're going to monitor brainwaves
[02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:50.760]  in the seats of the aircraft hell if you let them put your kids through a naked
[02:27:50.760 --> 02:27:54.120]  body scanner if you let them grop your your body
[02:27:54.120 --> 02:27:57.640]  i mean they now squeeze the woman and squeeze the man and grab your

[02:36:54.920 --> 02:36:58.920]  Driving around in a police car with art and police
[02:36:58.920 --> 02:37:00.920]  Into their American police force club
[02:37:00.920 --> 02:37:02.920]  Jesus, it's insane!

[02:37:13.920 --> 02:37:15.920]  And it was just not a matter of the day
[02:37:15.920 --> 02:37:17.920]  To connect the dots behind our heads
[02:37:17.920 --> 02:37:19.920]  Five versions of this story
[02:37:19.920 --> 02:37:21.920]  Can you add how they were before
[02:37:21.920 --> 02:37:23.920]  Getting in the end of that town?
[02:37:23.920 --> 02:37:24.920]  And the scanning mission
[02:37:24.920 --> 02:37:26.920]  That you currently want to get into the court
[02:37:26.920 --> 02:37:27.920]  You told me to go through the scanner
[02:37:27.920 --> 02:37:28.920]  And I said no
[02:37:28.920 --> 02:37:30.920]  It's a real act of submission
[02:37:30.920 --> 02:37:32.920]  They were involved in a crime
[02:37:32.920 --> 02:37:41.920]  This is huge!
[02:37:51.920 --> 02:37:53.920]  The police state isn't coming
[02:37:53.920 --> 02:37:54.920]  It's here
[02:37:54.920 --> 02:37:56.920]  Police state 4
[02:37:56.920 --> 02:37:59.920]  The rise of FEMA
[02:37:59.920 --> 02:38:01.920]  And that is the first trailer
[02:38:01.920 --> 02:38:03.920]  We'll have some other trailers and sneak peeks
[02:38:03.920 --> 02:38:05.920]  Next week for the documentary
[02:38:05.920 --> 02:38:07.920]  It will premiere the 21st of April
[02:38:07.920 --> 02:38:09.920]  At prisonplanet.tv
[02:38:09.920 --> 02:38:11.920]  For prisonplanet.tv
[02:38:11.920 --> 02:38:14.920]  Members, and if you want the highest quality DVD
[02:38:14.920 --> 02:38:16.920]  I want to support our work here
[02:38:16.920 --> 02:38:19.920]  Order the DVD so you get it first
[02:38:19.920 --> 02:38:20.920]  And don't waste time
[02:38:20.920 --> 02:38:22.920]  Everybody wants to know about the FEMA camps
[02:38:22.920 --> 02:38:24.920]  The government and the media are always lying
[02:38:24.920 --> 02:38:26.920]  And putting out this info
[02:38:26.920 --> 02:38:27.920]  This is their own words
[02:38:27.920 --> 02:38:28.920]  Their own congressional hearings
[02:38:28.920 --> 02:38:29.920]  Their own documents
[02:38:29.920 --> 02:38:31.920]  Video of the FEMA camps
[02:38:31.920 --> 02:38:32.920]  All the plans
[02:38:32.920 --> 02:38:33.920]  The gun confiscation
[02:38:33.920 --> 02:38:35.920]  The foreign troops
[02:38:35.920 --> 02:38:38.920]  FEMA NLEO 9
[02:38:38.920 --> 02:38:40.920]  The film literally covers
[02:38:40.920 --> 02:38:42.920]  The entire police state
[02:38:42.920 --> 02:38:43.920]  Homeland security

[02:38:50.920 --> 02:38:53.920]  888-253-3139
[02:38:53.920 --> 02:38:55.920]  We don't normally discount films
[02:38:55.920 --> 02:38:56.920]  When they first come out
[02:38:56.920 --> 02:38:58.920]  But I just want people to have these
[02:38:58.920 --> 02:39:00.920]  So if you get it with
[02:39:00.920 --> 02:39:02.920]  Invisible Empire
[02:39:02.920 --> 02:39:03.920]  A new order to find
[02:39:03.920 --> 02:39:04.920]  Jason Burmes's film
[02:39:04.920 --> 02:39:06.920]  That ships
[02:39:06.920 --> 02:39:08.920]  Honor before April 15th
[02:39:08.920 --> 02:39:09.920]  Premieres at prisonplanet.tv
[02:39:09.920 --> 02:39:12.920]  April 15th, an amazing film
[02:39:12.920 --> 02:39:14.920]  Go read the synopsis of the film
[02:39:14.920 --> 02:39:15.920]  At infowars.com
[02:39:15.920 --> 02:39:16.920]  Watch the trailer
[02:39:16.920 --> 02:39:18.920]  18 months in the making
[02:39:18.920 --> 02:39:19.920]  This is just as high a quality
[02:39:19.920 --> 02:39:21.920]  As my last few documentaries
[02:39:21.920 --> 02:39:22.920]  Produced in the house
[02:39:22.920 --> 02:39:23.920]  Great graphics
[02:39:23.920 --> 02:39:24.920]  The information is key
[02:39:24.920 --> 02:39:25.920]  Covers a lot of info
[02:39:25.920 --> 02:39:27.920]  We haven't gotten into
[02:39:27.920 --> 02:39:30.920]  Such an important film
[02:39:30.920 --> 02:39:32.920]  Invisible Empire
[02:39:32.920 --> 02:39:34.920]  You can get $5 off
[02:39:34.920 --> 02:39:36.920]  When you get the two films together
[02:39:36.920 --> 02:39:38.920]  Infowars.com
[02:39:38.920 --> 02:39:40.920]  Okay, they're now saying
[02:39:40.920 --> 02:39:42.920]  Five democratic party offices
[02:39:42.920 --> 02:39:43.920]  Around the country
[02:39:43.920 --> 02:39:45.920]  Have had bricks thrown through them
[02:39:45.920 --> 02:39:48.920]  Look stage to me
[02:39:48.920 --> 02:39:52.920]  You then have this new report
[02:39:52.920 --> 02:39:53.920]  From Fox News
[02:39:53.920 --> 02:39:54.920]  Cantor says campaign offices
[02:39:54.920 --> 02:39:55.920]  Was shot at
[02:39:55.920 --> 02:39:58.920]  Accuses dims of exploiting threats
[02:39:58.920 --> 02:40:00.920]  This is big national news
[02:40:00.920 --> 02:40:02.920]  Why was it not big news
[02:40:02.920 --> 02:40:04.920]  When Lou Dobbs got his house shot up?
[02:40:04.920 --> 02:40:05.920]  I mean, it's not good
[02:40:05.920 --> 02:40:07.920]  When anybody does this
[02:40:07.920 --> 02:40:08.920]  But sounds staged
[02:40:08.920 --> 02:40:10.920]  Or it'll be some unstable person
[02:40:10.920 --> 02:40:11.920]  And the system knows
[02:40:11.920 --> 02:40:12.920]  As they squeeze the population
[02:40:12.920 --> 02:40:14.920]  There's gonna be some real events
[02:40:14.920 --> 02:40:15.920]  That go on
[02:40:15.920 --> 02:40:16.920]  Virginia representative Eric Cantor
[02:40:16.920 --> 02:40:18.920]  Said Thursday that his Richmond campaign office
[02:40:18.920 --> 02:40:19.920]  Has been shot at
[02:40:19.920 --> 02:40:21.920]  And that he's received threatening emails
[02:40:21.920 --> 02:40:22.920]  But at the same time
[02:40:22.920 --> 02:40:24.920]  He told House Minority Whip
[02:40:24.920 --> 02:40:26.920]  He accused top Democrats
[02:40:26.920 --> 02:40:29.920]  Of trying to exploit the threats
[02:40:29.920 --> 02:40:32.920]  They've been receiving for political gain
[02:40:32.920 --> 02:40:35.920]  Now, let me expand into this article
[02:40:35.920 --> 02:40:37.920]  In fact, did I send you guys
[02:40:37.920 --> 02:40:39.920]  This MSNBC video clip
[02:40:39.920 --> 02:40:41.920]  That's in this article?
[02:40:41.920 --> 02:40:42.920]  Do you have the clip
[02:40:42.920 --> 02:40:44.920]  That's in this article
[02:40:44.920 --> 02:40:48.920]  Where they have the author of
[02:40:48.920 --> 02:40:53.920]  A article about the tea parties in it?
[02:40:53.920 --> 02:40:54.920]  Okay, good
[02:40:54.920 --> 02:40:55.920]  Because I want to go ahead
[02:40:55.920 --> 02:40:56.920]  And play that now
[02:40:56.920 --> 02:40:58.920]  And then break down the propaganda
[02:40:58.920 --> 02:41:03.920]  Because the governor's mansion
[02:41:03.920 --> 02:41:04.920]  Got firebombed
[02:41:04.920 --> 02:41:06.920]  And if it wasn't a staged event
[02:41:06.920 --> 02:41:07.920]  It was done by people
[02:41:07.920 --> 02:41:11.920]  That don't like government and Republicans
[02:41:11.920 --> 02:41:12.920]  We have all these videos
[02:41:12.920 --> 02:41:14.920]  Posted of Democratic Party thugs
[02:41:14.920 --> 02:41:17.920]  In Florida, in Missouri, and in other places
[02:41:17.920 --> 02:41:19.920]  Beating up tea party folks
[02:41:19.920 --> 02:41:21.920]  In legal lawful demonstrations
[02:41:21.920 --> 02:41:23.920]  And it never makes the national news
[02:41:23.920 --> 02:41:25.920]  It's always maybe on the local news
[02:41:25.920 --> 02:41:27.920]  Or just on YouTube
[02:41:27.920 --> 02:41:29.920]  You have all these calls for violence
[02:41:29.920 --> 02:41:31.920]  By Mecha and LaRaza
[02:41:31.920 --> 02:41:33.920]  A few weeks ago I saw a video
[02:41:33.920 --> 02:41:35.920]  From a Southern Property Law Center meeting
[02:41:35.920 --> 02:41:37.920]  With LaRaza's head there
[02:41:37.920 --> 02:41:39.920]  Talking about how they're fighting racism
[02:41:39.920 --> 02:41:41.920]  LaRaza means the race
[02:41:41.920 --> 02:41:44.920]  This is just a big of a race organization
[02:41:44.920 --> 02:41:47.920]  As the Aryan nations of the Ku Klux Klan
[02:41:47.920 --> 02:41:48.920]  Just as racist
[02:41:48.920 --> 02:41:49.920]  But much bigger
[02:41:49.920 --> 02:41:52.920]  Millions and millions of members
[02:41:52.920 --> 02:41:53.920]  And so what they've done
[02:41:53.920 --> 02:41:55.920]  Is they brought in all these foreigners
[02:41:55.920 --> 02:41:57.920]  On a liberation theology based hate of America
[02:41:57.920 --> 02:41:58.920]  Hate of white people
[02:41:58.920 --> 02:42:00.920]  But that's all kosher and good
[02:42:00.920 --> 02:42:02.920]  And loving and fun
[02:42:02.920 --> 02:42:06.920]  And then meanwhile
[02:42:06.920 --> 02:42:10.920]  Anybody who criticizes this
[02:42:10.920 --> 02:42:11.920]  Is then called a racist
[02:42:11.920 --> 02:42:13.920]  Oh, you don't like socialism, you're a racist
[02:42:13.920 --> 02:42:16.920]  Oh, you don't like government being so large
[02:42:16.920 --> 02:42:17.920]  You're a racist
[02:42:17.920 --> 02:42:18.920]  It isn't working anymore, though
[02:42:18.920 --> 02:42:21.920]  They have really used this guilt card
[02:42:21.920 --> 02:42:23.920]  On white America too long and it's over
[02:42:23.920 --> 02:42:25.920]  And more and more Hispanic Americans
[02:42:25.920 --> 02:42:26.920]  Black Americans know this
[02:42:26.920 --> 02:42:28.920]  What I've seen Gallup polls now
[02:42:28.920 --> 02:42:29.920]  Of over 80% of Hispanics
[02:42:29.920 --> 02:42:30.920]  Want to shut down the borders
[02:42:30.920 --> 02:42:31.920]  They're not stupid
[02:42:31.920 --> 02:42:33.920]  They're smart Americans
[02:42:33.920 --> 02:42:35.920]  As smart as anybody are smarter
[02:42:35.920 --> 02:42:37.920]  They know that the illegals
[02:42:37.920 --> 02:42:39.920]  Are being brought in to drive down the wages
[02:42:39.920 --> 02:42:41.920]  And it's destroying their standard of living
[02:42:41.920 --> 02:42:43.920]  They know America's being used as a steam valve
[02:42:43.920 --> 02:42:45.920]  For revolution in Mexico
[02:42:45.920 --> 02:42:47.920]  So Mexico won't implode
[02:42:47.920 --> 02:42:49.920]  We need the Mexicans who aren't citizens
[02:42:49.920 --> 02:42:50.920]  To go down there and take their country back
[02:42:50.920 --> 02:42:52.920]  It could be a wonderful place
[02:42:52.920 --> 02:42:55.920]  It's got three times the natural resources we've got
[02:42:55.920 --> 02:42:57.920]  I like Mexico, I like the Mexican people
[02:42:57.920 --> 02:42:59.920]  I'd like to be able to travel back down there
[02:42:59.920 --> 02:43:00.920]  But you can't
[02:43:00.920 --> 02:43:03.920]  It's a total police state imploding
[02:43:03.920 --> 02:43:05.920]  You know, we need to fix Mexico
[02:43:05.920 --> 02:43:07.920]  And we need to fix this country
[02:43:07.920 --> 02:43:09.920]  We need to decriminalize drugs
[02:43:09.920 --> 02:43:13.920]  Because it's the drug war that's making Mexico collapse
[02:43:13.920 --> 02:43:15.920]  And it's what's making the Southwest collapse
[02:43:15.920 --> 02:43:17.920]  Well, you guys bring me
[02:43:17.920 --> 02:43:19.920]  In fact, here it is
[02:43:19.920 --> 02:43:22.920]  This is the San Antonio Express news cover Sunday
[02:43:22.920 --> 02:43:28.920]  Drug war is killing Mexico border cities
[02:43:28.920 --> 02:43:30.920]  Of course, you decriminalize drugs
[02:43:30.920 --> 02:43:32.920]  This will end overnight
[02:43:32.920 --> 02:43:34.920]  Because there won't be all the profit involved
[02:43:34.920 --> 02:43:36.920]  But the government is laundering most of the drug money
[02:43:36.920 --> 02:43:38.920]  The drug war you see in Mexico
[02:43:38.920 --> 02:43:40.920]  Is about shutting off the competition
[02:43:40.920 --> 02:43:42.920]  It's about knocking off drug gangs
[02:43:42.920 --> 02:43:44.920]  That aren't paying their cut to the CIA
[02:43:44.920 --> 02:43:46.920]  And the big banks
[02:43:46.920 --> 02:43:48.920]  But here's this key article
[02:43:48.920 --> 02:43:49.920]  We need to get ahead of this
[02:43:49.920 --> 02:43:51.920]  We need to counter this now
[02:43:51.920 --> 02:43:54.920]  I'm going to cover it more next hour
[02:43:54.920 --> 02:43:56.920]  The media is trying to hide violence
[02:43:56.920 --> 02:43:58.920]  To get weak-minded, unstable people
[02:43:58.920 --> 02:44:00.920]  To go out and be violent
[02:44:00.920 --> 02:44:02.920]  And copycat stuff against Democrats
[02:44:02.920 --> 02:44:04.920]  So they can play the part of victims
[02:44:04.920 --> 02:44:05.920]  They're also setting the stages
[02:44:05.920 --> 02:44:07.920]  I've told you for tea parties and others
[02:44:07.920 --> 02:44:08.920]  To commit terror attacks
[02:44:08.920 --> 02:44:10.920]  To be blamed on the American people
[02:44:10.920 --> 02:44:11.920]  That will be staged
[02:44:11.920 --> 02:44:12.920]  I've told you this is all coming
[02:44:12.920 --> 02:44:14.920]  To see it unfolding
[02:44:14.920 --> 02:44:15.920]  But in this article
[02:44:15.920 --> 02:44:17.920]  It exposes who the real thugs are
[02:44:17.920 --> 02:44:19.920]  Pro-Obamacare thugs, not tea party activists
[02:44:19.920 --> 02:44:21.920]  Are the real violent extremists
[02:44:21.920 --> 02:44:23.920]  Prisonplanet.com by Paul Joseph Watson
[02:44:23.920 --> 02:44:25.920]  And I want to go to this clip
[02:44:25.920 --> 02:44:27.920]  Of a tea party activist who's an author
[02:44:27.920 --> 02:44:29.920]  Who really stood his ground
[02:44:29.920 --> 02:44:30.920]  And won the debate
[02:44:30.920 --> 02:44:33.920]  The anchor was very angry on MSNBC
[02:44:33.920 --> 02:44:35.920]  I believe it's MSNBC, isn't it?
[02:44:35.920 --> 02:44:37.920]  We're going to play this piece of propaganda
[02:44:37.920 --> 02:44:39.920]  The guy says, okay, you give me an example
[02:44:39.920 --> 02:44:41.920]  Of violence by Democrats
[02:44:41.920 --> 02:44:44.920]  And that was the one part where he said
[02:44:44.920 --> 02:44:46.920]  Well, there have been examples
[02:44:46.920 --> 02:44:48.920]  But I don't have to get into them now
[02:44:48.920 --> 02:44:49.920]  What do you mean?
[02:44:49.920 --> 02:44:50.920]  We have a bunch of these examples
[02:44:50.920 --> 02:44:52.920]  And we have Jewish activists
[02:44:52.920 --> 02:44:54.920]  And black activists, college students
[02:44:54.920 --> 02:44:56.920]  Caught painting swastikas on their dorms
[02:44:56.920 --> 02:44:58.920]  Burning down their own churches
[02:44:58.920 --> 02:45:00.920]  How many times have they been caught?
[02:45:00.920 --> 02:45:01.920]  And when they get caught
[02:45:01.920 --> 02:45:02.920]  It's a minor footnote
[02:45:02.920 --> 02:45:04.920]  Most of this is staged
[02:45:04.920 --> 02:45:05.920]  Some of this is real
[02:45:05.920 --> 02:45:08.920]  I believe the few racial epithets
[02:45:08.920 --> 02:45:11.920]  That were shown in Obama
[02:45:11.920 --> 02:45:14.920]  During the passage of the House healthcare bill
[02:45:14.920 --> 02:45:16.920]  Sunday were staged
[02:45:16.920 --> 02:45:18.920]  We know the Southern Poverty Law Center, ADL
[02:45:18.920 --> 02:45:20.920]  We know Hal Turner, the big top Nazi
[02:45:20.920 --> 02:45:22.920]  Was an FBI officer, agent
[02:45:22.920 --> 02:45:24.920]  Not just an informant
[02:45:24.920 --> 02:45:28.920]  Let's go ahead and play this clip, though
[02:45:28.920 --> 02:45:30.920]  Joining us is the author of The Big Black Lie
[02:45:30.920 --> 02:45:32.920]  How I learned the truth about democracy
[02:45:32.920 --> 02:45:34.920]  About the Democratic Party
[02:45:34.920 --> 02:45:36.920]  And Kevin Jackson, first of all
[02:45:36.920 --> 02:45:38.920]  What do you make of the latest information
[02:45:38.920 --> 02:45:42.920]  From Congress that there are increasing concerns
[02:45:42.920 --> 02:45:44.920]  About this possibly getting out of hand
[02:45:44.920 --> 02:45:48.920]  Some of this violent imagery and rhetoric
[02:45:48.920 --> 02:45:50.920]  Well, I've been to many tea parties
[02:45:50.920 --> 02:45:51.920]  Around the country
[02:45:51.920 --> 02:45:52.920]  And I've yet to see anybody
[02:45:52.920 --> 02:45:54.920]  Any real violence towards anybody
[02:45:54.920 --> 02:45:56.920]  So I think it's a bit overstated
[02:45:56.920 --> 02:45:59.920]  Were you there on Saturday, though
[02:45:59.920 --> 02:46:01.920]  At the Capitol when Congressman Lewis
[02:46:01.920 --> 02:46:02.920]  And other members of the Congressional
[02:46:02.920 --> 02:46:05.920]  Black Caucus were greeted with
[02:46:05.920 --> 02:46:07.920]  Derogatory racial slurs
[02:46:07.920 --> 02:46:08.920]  When another member of Congress
[02:46:08.920 --> 02:46:11.920]  Was spat upon, were you there for that?
[02:46:11.920 --> 02:46:12.920]  Wasn't there for that
[02:46:12.920 --> 02:46:14.920]  But I saw the video about it
[02:46:14.920 --> 02:46:16.920]  And determined that a lot of what they were saying
[02:46:16.920 --> 02:46:18.920]  Had happened, actually hadn't occurred
[02:46:18.920 --> 02:46:20.920]  Like I said, I've been to hundreds of tea parties
[02:46:20.920 --> 02:46:21.920]  Around the country
[02:46:21.920 --> 02:46:22.920]  What I can tell you is
[02:46:22.920 --> 02:46:24.920]  I've never seen any blacks lynched at one of them
[02:46:24.920 --> 02:46:26.920]  It's still one of the things that's
[02:46:26.920 --> 02:46:29.920]  Only for the Democrats to hold a distinction about
[02:46:29.920 --> 02:46:31.920]  But Kevin, are you okay when
[02:46:31.920 --> 02:46:33.920]  President Obama, the first African-American president
[02:46:33.920 --> 02:46:35.920]  Is depicted the way he's depicted
[02:46:35.920 --> 02:46:36.920]  On some of these signs
[02:46:36.920 --> 02:46:38.920]  Whether it's the Hitler mustache
[02:46:38.920 --> 02:46:40.920]  Or whether it's being depicted as like the Joker
[02:46:40.920 --> 02:46:44.920]  I mean, is that okay with you?
[02:46:44.920 --> 02:46:46.920]  It's par for the course
[02:46:46.920 --> 02:46:47.920]  Every president that's been elected
[02:46:47.920 --> 02:46:48.920]  Has gone through something like that
[02:46:48.920 --> 02:46:52.920]  Bush has been, was demonized as a gorilla
[02:46:52.920 --> 02:46:55.920]  As a chimpanzee, as a cowboy, cowpoke
[02:46:55.920 --> 02:46:57.920]  And a host of other things
[02:46:57.920 --> 02:46:59.920]  In fact, he was depicted as Hitler many, many times
[02:46:59.920 --> 02:47:02.920]  I did a blog about the idea that Bush
[02:47:02.920 --> 02:47:04.920]  Was depicted as Hitler more than Obama was
[02:47:04.920 --> 02:47:06.920]  So that's his par for the course
[02:47:06.920 --> 02:47:07.920]  That's what happens
[02:47:07.920 --> 02:47:09.920]  One side wins, the other side goes after him
[02:47:09.920 --> 02:47:11.920]  So I don't see any difference between him
[02:47:11.920 --> 02:47:13.920]  Between Obama and any other president in this respect
[02:47:13.920 --> 02:47:16.920]  Well, do you remember any Republican members
[02:47:16.920 --> 02:47:19.920]  Of Congress or Republican Party officers
[02:47:19.920 --> 02:47:22.920]  That had bricks thrown through their front windows?
[02:47:22.920 --> 02:47:23.920]  I mean, that's happened now
[02:47:23.920 --> 02:47:27.920]  Half a dozen times over the past few days
[02:47:27.920 --> 02:47:29.920]  Yeah, in fact, there's been many instances
[02:47:29.920 --> 02:47:31.920]  Where Republicans have been attacked
[02:47:31.920 --> 02:47:33.920]  Whether it's at the local level
[02:47:33.920 --> 02:47:35.920]  Up to the national level
[02:47:35.920 --> 02:47:37.920]  I'm our responsibility in the name
[02:47:37.920 --> 02:47:40.920]  And the point is that everything that you guys want to say
[02:47:40.920 --> 02:47:42.920]  Start a hit pause
[02:47:42.920 --> 02:47:44.920]  Watson looking five minutes
[02:47:44.920 --> 02:47:46.920]  I called him this morning and said, look
[02:47:46.920 --> 02:47:49.920]  Remember the union thugs beating people up in Florida
[02:47:49.920 --> 02:47:51.920]  And St. Louis in California
[02:47:51.920 --> 02:47:53.920]  Remember that congressman
[02:47:53.920 --> 02:47:54.920]  Office getting shot
[02:47:54.920 --> 02:47:56.920]  Remember the congressman getting the bricks thrown in
[02:47:56.920 --> 02:47:58.920]  Remember Lou Dobbs
[02:47:58.920 --> 02:48:01.920]  Without even looking, we found
[02:48:01.920 --> 02:48:04.920]  Scores of examples that are in this article
[02:48:04.920 --> 02:48:06.920]  But that's what the media does
[02:48:06.920 --> 02:48:08.920]  They try to play these little tricks
[02:48:08.920 --> 02:48:11.920]  To make it look like this isn't going on
[02:48:11.920 --> 02:48:14.920]  And we've got all the cases
[02:48:14.920 --> 02:48:16.920]  Where they stage these attacks against themselves
[02:48:16.920 --> 02:48:18.920]  Where they've been caught doing it
[02:48:18.920 --> 02:48:20.920]  And then let's think about the IRS
[02:48:20.920 --> 02:48:22.920]  Without due process
[02:48:22.920 --> 02:48:24.920]  Stomping into people's houses
[02:48:24.920 --> 02:48:26.920]  Taking their furniture, taking everything they got
[02:48:26.920 --> 02:48:28.920]  Swat teams busting in on the wrong houses
[02:48:28.920 --> 02:48:29.920]  Killing people
[02:48:29.920 --> 02:48:31.920]  I've got articles here
[02:48:31.920 --> 02:48:32.920]  Out of New York
[02:48:32.920 --> 02:48:33.920]  New York City cops
[02:48:33.920 --> 02:48:35.920]  Sorry for pounding on couples door
[02:48:35.920 --> 02:48:37.920]  50 times because of a police
[02:48:37.920 --> 02:48:39.920]  Database that was wrong
[02:48:41.920 --> 02:48:42.920]  I mean think about
[02:48:42.920 --> 02:48:44.920]  When the government abuses or hurts people
[02:48:44.920 --> 02:48:46.920]  It's always a minor footnote
[02:48:46.920 --> 02:48:48.920]  But then maybe real people did
[02:48:48.920 --> 02:48:50.920]  Throw bricks through their windows
[02:48:50.920 --> 02:48:52.920]  Why is it now such a big deal
[02:48:52.920 --> 02:48:54.920]  When the media always ignores it
[02:48:54.920 --> 02:48:56.920]  That's why some of these reports
[02:48:56.920 --> 02:48:58.920]  Are destroyed
[02:49:02.920 --> 02:49:05.920]  Let's continue
[02:49:05.920 --> 02:49:07.920]  And we have evidence
[02:49:07.920 --> 02:49:09.920]  And we have videos and photographs
[02:49:09.920 --> 02:49:11.920]  Of people of incidents in
[02:49:11.920 --> 02:49:12.920]  Niagara, New York
[02:49:12.920 --> 02:49:13.920]  Rochester, New York
[02:49:13.920 --> 02:49:15.920]  Arizona, Ohio, and Kansas
[02:49:15.920 --> 02:49:17.920]  Where Democratic party offices
[02:49:17.920 --> 02:49:19.920]  Were targeted with stones or bricks
[02:49:19.920 --> 02:49:21.920]  And you're saying that
[02:49:21.920 --> 02:49:25.200]  these are Democrat operatives that are doing a lot of this stuff.
[02:49:25.200 --> 02:49:31.720]  So when you can breathe the evidence and say, this was a Republican person that did that
[02:49:31.720 --> 02:49:32.720]  and I'll believe you.
[02:49:32.720 --> 02:49:36.360]  These are Democratic operatives who are destroying their own property so that somehow people
[02:49:36.360 --> 02:49:39.360]  would just, I don't know, just choose to blame them on Republicans.
[02:49:39.360 --> 02:49:40.360]  You really believe that?
[02:49:40.360 --> 02:49:43.640]  Yeah, it's kind of like when there are riots in Watson, black people go and loot their
[02:49:43.640 --> 02:49:46.600]  own stores and you wonder why did it happen.
[02:49:46.600 --> 02:49:47.800]  It's the same reason.
[02:49:47.800 --> 02:49:53.920]  So when you can tell me with complete evidence that the people that are doing this are Republicans
[02:49:53.920 --> 02:49:55.880]  and I'll be happy to answer your question.
[02:49:55.880 --> 02:50:00.320]  But until then, all you've got is anecdotal evidence, the same way that you have anecdotal
[02:50:00.320 --> 02:50:04.760]  evidence around the Tea Party groups and saying that everybody's a racist, I'm an example
[02:50:04.760 --> 02:50:07.880]  of a person who's been to these events.
[02:50:07.880 --> 02:50:12.320]  Now one single racial incident can I point at, and yet you want to have me here to talk
[02:50:12.320 --> 02:50:13.320]  about how racist it is.
[02:50:13.320 --> 02:50:16.760]  I'm not even saying most of the Tea Portiers are racist, I'm saying that there is a racist
[02:50:16.760 --> 02:50:21.040]  fringe to this and that I wish Republican leaders and Tea Party supporters like yourself
[02:50:21.040 --> 02:50:22.040]  would condemn them.
[02:50:22.040 --> 02:50:23.800]  Well, there's a racist fringe to the Democrat Party because as I said, I've yet to see
[02:50:23.800 --> 02:50:26.280]  a black man lynched at a Tea Party.
[02:50:26.280 --> 02:50:29.200]  But I do know that the Democrat Party has lynched black people.
[02:50:29.200 --> 02:50:33.960]  So if you want to make that equivalency, then let's talk about that for a bit.
[02:50:33.960 --> 02:50:37.680]  Kevin Jackson, you know I disagree with you on a lot of stuff, but I do appreciate you
[02:50:37.680 --> 02:50:38.680]  coming on today.
[02:50:38.680 --> 02:50:39.680]  All right.
[02:50:39.680 --> 02:50:40.680]  My friend.
[02:50:40.680 --> 02:50:49.680]  He kicked his butt, but this whole guilt by association, you start robbing 300 million
[02:50:49.680 --> 02:50:50.680]  people.
[02:50:50.680 --> 02:50:54.560]  You're going to get some pushback.
[02:50:54.560 --> 02:50:56.520]  We'll be right back with more of your phone calls.
[02:50:56.520 --> 02:51:05.240]  Stay with us.
[02:51:05.240 --> 02:51:11.520]  As the economy continues to decline, patriots across the nation are preparing for the worst.
[02:51:11.520 --> 02:51:13.720]  The world is changing fast.
[02:51:13.720 --> 02:51:19.200]  Are you fully prepared or will you be forced to eat government soup?
[02:51:19.200 --> 02:51:27.680]  At www.patreonfood.com, we offer you 135 pounds of dehydrated food and six varieties of canned
[02:51:27.680 --> 02:51:29.920]  meat for half price.
[02:51:29.920 --> 02:51:38.280]  And at survivalistseeds.com, we now offer 50 non-GMO varieties of vegetables and over
[02:51:38.280 --> 02:51:41.440]  10,000 heirloom seeds.
[02:51:41.440 --> 02:51:46.480]  That's twice as many as our competition for the same price.
[02:51:46.480 --> 02:51:50.880]  www.patreonfood.com and survivalistseeds.com.
[02:51:50.880 --> 02:51:53.440]  Food insurance just in case.
[02:51:53.440 --> 02:52:02.680]  Owned by me, Big John Lipscomb.
[02:52:02.680 --> 02:52:06.440]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:06.440 --> 02:52:09.560]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:09.560 --> 02:52:13.920]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[02:52:13.920 --> 02:52:14.920]  at home.
[02:52:14.920 --> 02:52:19.560]  We've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are
[02:52:19.560 --> 02:52:20.560]  calling the shots.
[02:52:20.560 --> 02:52:25.840]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:25.840 --> 02:52:29.240]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[02:52:29.240 --> 02:52:35.040]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[02:52:35.040 --> 02:52:36.040]  world government.
[02:52:36.040 --> 02:52:38.480]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[02:52:38.480 --> 02:52:42.440]  They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[02:52:42.440 --> 02:52:47.960]  Today, it seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen
[02:52:47.960 --> 02:52:49.800]  a fall of the Republic.
[02:52:49.800 --> 02:52:54.240]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[02:52:54.240 --> 02:53:01.040]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:53:01.040 --> 02:53:06.040]  Did you know that there are tiny hidden radio transmitters also known as RFID chips in millions
[02:53:06.040 --> 02:53:08.240]  of passports, credit cards and licenses?
[02:53:08.240 --> 02:53:12.240]  In the current state of the economy, it's no surprise that identity theft has increased.
[02:53:12.240 --> 02:53:16.120]  With current technology, thieves can purchase a simple device online that allows them to
[02:53:16.120 --> 02:53:20.640]  steal your credit card number and other personal information by scanning your wallet or purse.
[02:53:20.640 --> 02:53:23.440]  Think of this identity theft device as a garage door opener.
[02:53:23.440 --> 02:53:26.440]  You push a button and within a certain distance your door opens.
[02:53:26.440 --> 02:53:27.440]  Thieves get near you.

[02:54:19.840 --> 02:54:26.640]  I say that I'm doing it for my mom and my teacher Matt is really excited that I'm doing
[02:54:26.640 --> 02:54:31.920]  all of this and that he's been following me every move.
[02:54:31.920 --> 02:54:35.040]  I'm almost afraid to ask you what you want to do when you grow up because you're more
[02:54:35.040 --> 02:54:36.680]  grown up than a whole lot of people.
[02:54:36.680 --> 02:54:37.680]  I know.
[02:54:37.680 --> 02:54:38.680]  What do you ever thought about that?
[02:54:38.680 --> 02:54:40.640]  What do you want to do when you grow up?
[02:54:40.640 --> 02:54:43.680]  I want to become the president of the United States.
[02:54:43.680 --> 02:54:45.240]  Oh, well, all right.
[02:54:45.240 --> 02:54:51.800]  You're a little Marcellus Owens being used by Barack Obama because they know that their
[02:54:51.800 --> 02:54:55.280]  approval ratings have dropped the lowest ever in history.
[02:54:55.280 --> 02:55:00.360]  For Congress, the president, you name it, this guy's more unpopular than Richard Nixon
[02:55:00.360 --> 02:55:06.560]  in his last months now and there's poor little Marcellus Owens, I'm sure a well-meaning person
[02:55:06.560 --> 02:55:11.600]  being duped thinking he's giving people free healthcare and I showed you the associated
[02:55:11.600 --> 02:55:18.560]  press earlier, in fact, here it is, Marcellus, where it says in the bill, kids are not covered
[02:55:18.560 --> 02:55:21.920]  for preexisting conditions.
[02:55:21.920 --> 02:55:22.920]  There you go.
[02:55:22.920 --> 02:55:26.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be able to refuse coverage to children with preexisting conditions
[02:55:26.640 --> 02:55:27.640]  right there.
[02:55:27.640 --> 02:55:28.640]  Associated Press.
[02:55:28.640 --> 02:55:33.840]  Oh, and Hitler loved always having kids around him and kids at signing statements and when
[02:55:33.840 --> 02:55:35.600]  he was signing bills.
[02:55:35.600 --> 02:55:40.040]  So here's little Owens with our modern Hitler, but we don't recognize this tyrant because
[02:55:40.040 --> 02:55:42.160]  he's got brown skin.
[02:55:42.160 --> 02:55:45.360]  We all know that tyranny can only come from white skin.
[02:55:45.360 --> 02:55:47.840]  In fact, tyranny can only come from a Hitler mustache.
[02:55:47.840 --> 02:55:52.160]  No, ladies and gentlemen, it's the same thing repeating itself.
[02:55:52.160 --> 02:55:55.520]  Hitler was a national socialist and they had government healthcare and they used it to
[02:55:55.520 --> 02:55:58.240]  take control of people's lives.
[02:55:58.240 --> 02:56:02.560]  And now here's this poor little boy up on television being used.
[02:56:02.560 --> 02:56:04.320]  Leif in Montana, you're on the air.
[02:56:04.320 --> 02:56:05.320]  Thanks for holding.
[02:56:05.320 --> 02:56:07.960]  How are you doing, Alex?
[02:56:07.960 --> 02:56:09.920]  I'm doing his best I can to fight these people.
[02:56:09.920 --> 02:56:10.920]  Go ahead.
[02:56:10.920 --> 02:56:11.920]  You're doing great.
[02:56:11.920 --> 02:56:15.920]  Earlier this morning I was listening to one of your shows, one of your past shows, and
[02:56:15.920 --> 02:56:21.320]  you mentioned that some of the rich are finding out that they're not really some of the elite.
[02:56:21.320 --> 02:56:25.640]  A few years ago I was attending a Sundance at the holy man that conducts a ceremony.
[02:56:25.640 --> 02:56:31.160]  I was telling him a time that he had been shown when America was under starvation, not
[02:56:31.160 --> 02:56:36.680]  because there was a food shortage, but because the super rich were hoarding the food.
[02:56:36.680 --> 02:56:41.840]  The super elite, the real rich are the ones that are going to run, everyone.
[02:56:41.840 --> 02:56:45.400]  You know, I've actually heard some of those Native Americans, they've been saying that
[02:56:45.400 --> 02:56:49.800]  for a hundred years that that was going to come to America and that the elite were going
[02:56:49.800 --> 02:56:51.240]  to shut off the food.
[02:56:51.240 --> 02:56:55.200]  The same way they put Native Americans on reservations, the same way they broke up their
[02:56:55.200 --> 02:56:56.200]  families.
[02:56:56.200 --> 02:57:01.720]  Hitler bragged that he took his ideas on how to set up camps from what was done by the
[02:57:01.720 --> 02:57:05.000]  British and others here in the United States.
[02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:12.520]  Well, and reservations are a good example of how you treat us will also come to you.
[02:57:12.520 --> 02:57:18.080]  You know, we're allowing these few people to control everything, but just look at the
[02:57:18.080 --> 02:57:22.040]  microculture on a reservation, they're trying to drew the whole world that way.
[02:57:22.040 --> 02:57:26.840]  And I hope listeners realize that when I make films like Endgame and I show you books like
[02:57:26.840 --> 02:57:31.800]  Eco Science by the White House Science are, they talk about their goal is setting up world
[02:57:31.800 --> 02:57:34.960]  government and then killing the majority of the population.
[02:57:34.960 --> 02:57:35.960]  It's the truth.
[02:57:35.960 --> 02:57:38.320]  It doesn't matter how nuts it sounds.
[02:57:38.320 --> 02:57:44.160]  We're not nuts talking about it, the nuts of the people that write this are and we're
[02:57:44.160 --> 02:57:45.680]  familiar with it.
[02:57:45.680 --> 02:57:50.800]  Our concern, you know, I'm native, our concern is about the human race, not just about, you
[02:57:50.800 --> 02:57:52.280]  know, the poor India.
[02:57:52.280 --> 02:57:55.040]  We're all falling under this and it's up to us to change it.
[02:57:55.040 --> 02:58:01.040]  Us as a human race, not to be slaves, to push them back and say no and become active in
[02:58:01.040 --> 02:58:04.680]  our families and our community again to push back.
[02:58:04.680 --> 02:58:08.200]  You know, I've read that many of the Native Americans are exempt from this because you're
[02:58:08.200 --> 02:58:12.680]  your own nation, but you're already under a lot of the reservation and federal control
[02:58:12.680 --> 02:58:13.680]  already.
[02:58:13.680 --> 02:58:14.680]  It is.
[02:58:14.680 --> 02:58:18.280]  Yeah, it's not true sovereignty, like they tell us.
[02:58:18.280 --> 02:58:23.840]  We pay taxes, we're bound by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and in some ways we find it
[02:58:23.840 --> 02:58:29.360]  interesting Barack Obama has been adopted by the Crow Indians and in our world, an adoption
[02:58:29.360 --> 02:58:34.960]  is my blood, but it still doesn't make him a decent human being just because he's Indian
[02:58:34.960 --> 02:58:35.960]  now.
[02:58:35.960 --> 02:58:37.880]  He's nothing but a puppet reading off a teleprompter.
[02:58:37.880 --> 02:58:38.880]  God bless you.
[02:58:38.880 --> 02:58:43.400]  Final hour, straight ahead, more calls, tons of news.
[02:58:43.400 --> 02:58:45.880]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:45.880 --> 02:58:51.320]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[02:58:51.320 --> 02:58:52.640]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:58:52.640 --> 02:58:56.600]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage
[02:58:56.600 --> 02:58:58.240]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:58:58.240 --> 02:59:02.280]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver
[02:59:02.280 --> 02:59:03.280]  or gold?
[02:59:03.280 --> 02:59:04.280]  It's true.
[02:59:04.280 --> 02:59:07.200]  Seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible
[02:59:07.200 --> 02:59:08.840]  that could even happen again.
[02:59:08.840 --> 02:59:13.360]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[02:59:13.360 --> 02:59:14.360]  seeds.
[02:59:14.360 --> 02:59:19.320]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense
[02:59:19.320 --> 02:59:21.160]  food for you and your family.
[02:59:21.160 --> 02:59:22.280]  And here's the best part.
[02:59:22.280 --> 02:59:26.480]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds
[02:59:26.480 --> 02:59:29.000]  to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:32.240]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:59:32.240 --> 02:59:39.040]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:59:39.040 --> 02:59:43.160]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:59:43.160 --> 02:59:48.040]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:59:48.040 --> 02:59:54.280]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:59:54.280 --> 03:00:09.280]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:09.280 --> 03:00:18.000]  It is already the 4th and final hour of this Thursday, the 25th day of March 2010 edition.
[03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:23.680]  I'm going to continue covering news and we're going to be taking your phone calls at the
[03:00:23.680 --> 03:00:24.680]  bottom of the hour.
[03:00:24.680 --> 03:00:29.840]  I'm going to have Matt Ryan, one of my producers in here, to tell you a little story that happened
[03:00:29.840 --> 03:00:39.920]  to some of his relatives and how it ties into victim disarmament and these brinks commercials
[03:00:39.920 --> 03:00:44.000]  where it shows these thugs trying to attack women and they just huddle down with their
[03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:47.920]  alarm going off and that supposedly protects them.
[03:00:47.920 --> 03:00:50.840]  That is not truth in advertising.
[03:00:50.840 --> 03:00:54.280]  It's fine to have an alarm to let you know somebody's breaking in.
[03:00:54.280 --> 03:01:00.720]  The next step is to have the firearm to defend yourself and to stop the attacker, stop them
[03:01:00.720 --> 03:01:03.400]  dead in their tracks.
[03:01:03.400 --> 03:01:06.520]  So that is coming up also.
[03:01:06.520 --> 03:01:08.920]  Right now, let's go ahead and go back to your calls.
[03:01:08.920 --> 03:01:10.960]  Let's talk to Leo in Missouri.
[03:01:10.960 --> 03:01:11.960]  You're on the air.
[03:01:11.960 --> 03:01:13.960]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[03:01:13.960 --> 03:01:14.960]  Welcome.
[03:01:14.960 --> 03:01:20.120]  I just wanted to get your thoughts on something I had been thinking about and that is as opposition
[03:01:20.120 --> 03:01:25.400]  grows amongst the people to this health care bill, what do you think the chances are of
[03:01:25.400 --> 03:01:30.440]  a big scale terrorist attack happening in this country?
[03:01:30.440 --> 03:01:33.200]  That's all I've been talking about the last three, four months is that they're going to
[03:01:33.200 --> 03:01:35.640]  stage events and blame it on the Tea Parties.
[03:01:35.640 --> 03:01:38.520]  They're going to stage events and blame it on the Berthers and 9-Eleven Truth and you've
[03:01:38.520 --> 03:01:44.480]  seen that start and in every case it's clear that this is being staged and the Southern
[03:01:44.480 --> 03:01:50.080]  Property Law Center and ADL are out preparing the public mind for this and they're absolutely
[03:01:50.080 --> 03:01:55.000]  going to have to have staged terror attacks to be able to force all this through and I
[03:01:55.000 --> 03:01:59.360]  agree with Rush Limbaugh, they may stage events to try to suspend the election.
[03:01:59.360 --> 03:02:03.360]  There is no doubt there's been a lot of talk about suspension of elections before because
[03:02:03.360 --> 03:02:07.600]  of the police state being set up, but now they've got it in place.
[03:02:07.600 --> 03:02:12.800]  And I guess today it was just a big coincidence that Osama been loud and showed up back in
[03:02:12.800 --> 03:02:15.560]  the news again.
[03:02:15.560 --> 03:02:16.560]  That's right.
[03:02:16.560 --> 03:02:19.840]  Every time they need a good distraction, Governor Ridge admitted former head of Homeland
[03:02:19.840 --> 03:02:25.360]  Security last year in a book that they would issue fake terror alerts for political gain
[03:02:25.360 --> 03:02:27.000]  as a political distraction.
[03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:34.120]  In the Patriot Act, issuing a fake terror threat or alert is a very serious felony,
[03:02:34.120 --> 03:02:36.120]  but it's okay when the government does it.
[03:02:36.120 --> 03:02:38.320]  Yeah, that seems to be the case.
[03:02:38.320 --> 03:02:39.960]  That's all I wanted to talk to you about today.
[03:02:39.960 --> 03:02:41.120]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:02:41.120 --> 03:02:43.320]  Leo, incredibly powerful points.
[03:02:43.320 --> 03:02:47.320]  1-800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us.
[03:02:47.320 --> 03:02:50.840]  Doug in Oregon, you're on the air.
[03:02:50.840 --> 03:02:52.840]  Afternoon, Alex.
[03:02:52.840 --> 03:02:53.840]  Welcome.
[03:02:53.840 --> 03:02:54.840]  Yes, welcome.
[03:02:54.840 --> 03:03:04.920]  Oh, hey, Alex, I was wondering if you could possibly give us a resource or a web resource
[03:03:04.920 --> 03:03:13.440]  or maybe you could get a special guest on to inform the listeners, how do you go about
[03:03:13.440 --> 03:03:22.320]  convening a grand jury to indict these people, how do you go about starting a recall, how
[03:03:22.320 --> 03:03:29.520]  do you get your attorney generals to look at evidence and these kind of things because
[03:03:29.520 --> 03:03:33.000]  I think so many people are overwhelmed by the bureaucracy of it all.
[03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:38.000]  Look, number one, you call them, you go visit them in their offices, you demand strong action.
[03:03:38.000 --> 03:03:44.720]  I had Judge Napolitano talk about solutions in the second hour today.
[03:03:44.720 --> 03:03:48.080]  We've had Red Beckman on many times, we had him on a few weeks ago.
[03:03:48.080 --> 03:03:52.480]  In fact, let's go ahead and get Red Beckman back on for another hour just to talk about
[03:03:52.480 --> 03:03:54.680]  how to get grand juries convened.
[03:03:54.680 --> 03:03:59.720]  The government's tried to turn grand juries into creatures of the prosecutors where they
[03:03:59.720 --> 03:04:05.120]  are kept political slaves, basically, of the system.
[03:04:05.120 --> 03:04:10.960]  And grand juries are supposed to decide, in many cases, what they want to go after.
[03:04:10.960 --> 03:04:15.280]  And so you simply try to bring information to the grand jury, there's different procedures
[03:04:15.280 --> 03:04:18.720]  depending on your state to do that, but that's a good idea.
[03:04:18.720 --> 03:04:20.600]  We will do an hour on that next week.
[03:04:20.600 --> 03:04:27.000]  Okay, Alex, I thank you very kindly and God's grace and peace to your family and keep up
[03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:28.000]  the good work.
[03:04:28.000 --> 03:04:29.480]  Thank you so much for the call.
[03:04:29.480 --> 03:04:30.480]  Okay, we're going to go to break.
[03:04:30.480 --> 03:04:34.760]  I'm going to come back and get into some more news, recap some top stories, and then we're
[03:04:34.760 --> 03:04:39.400]  going to continue with your calls and then get into this victimization of society where
[03:04:39.400 --> 03:04:43.400]  everybody just lays there and takes it, this domestication.
[03:04:43.400 --> 03:04:46.440]  It's all coming up after this quick break.
[03:04:46.440 --> 03:04:48.680]  You have founded the front lines of the Info Wars.
[03:04:48.680 --> 03:04:52.760]  We wage war on corruption and crash through the lines and disinformation.
[03:04:52.760 --> 03:04:53.760]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:53.760 --> 03:04:54.760]  Stay with us.
[03:04:54.760 --> 03:05:04.680]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:05:04.680 --> 03:05:09.240]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[03:05:09.240 --> 03:05:10.240]  do you want?
[03:05:10.240 --> 03:05:15.760]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[03:05:15.760 --> 03:05:17.280]  Food is your only ammunition.
[03:05:17.280 --> 03:05:18.520]  How much do you want?
[03:05:18.520 --> 03:05:19.600]  When do you want it?
[03:05:19.600 --> 03:05:21.560]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:05:21.560 --> 03:05:22.680]  When will you need it?
[03:05:22.680 --> 03:05:24.800]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:05:24.800 --> 03:05:26.160]  Will there be any food?
[03:05:26.160 --> 03:05:27.600]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:05:27.600 --> 03:05:31.720]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[03:05:31.720 --> 03:05:32.920]  and be immunized?
[03:05:32.920 --> 03:05:36.680]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:05:36.680 --> 03:05:40.280]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:05:40.280 --> 03:05:41.520]  How much will you need?
[03:05:41.520 --> 03:05:42.520]  We don't know.
[03:05:42.520 --> 03:05:43.520]  How much do you want?
[03:05:43.520 --> 03:05:44.520]  All you can get.
[03:05:44.520 --> 03:05:45.520]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:45.520 --> 03:05:48.640]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[03:06:06.360 --> 03:06:09.120]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world.
[03:06:09.120 --> 03:06:14.360]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[03:06:14.360 --> 03:06:18.960]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from infowars.com.

[03:06:34.480 --> 03:06:35.480]  place.
[03:06:35.480 --> 03:06:38.120]  This film needs to be seen, everybody needs to get it.

[03:06:59.480 --> 03:07:05.120]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:07:05.120 --> 03:07:09.480]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[03:07:09.480 --> 03:07:10.480]  do you want?
[03:07:10.480 --> 03:07:12.480]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:07:12.480 --> 03:07:17.520]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:07:17.520 --> 03:07:18.760]  How much do you want?
[03:07:18.760 --> 03:07:19.760]  When do you want it?
[03:07:19.760 --> 03:07:21.760]  Now or after the battle starts.
[03:07:21.760 --> 03:07:22.880]  When will you need it?
[03:07:22.880 --> 03:07:25.000]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:07:25.000 --> 03:07:26.360]  Will there be any food?
[03:07:26.360 --> 03:07:27.800]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:07:27.800 --> 03:07:31.960]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[03:07:31.960 --> 03:07:33.120]  and be immunized?
[03:07:33.120 --> 03:07:36.880]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:07:36.880 --> 03:07:40.500]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:07:40.500 --> 03:07:41.720]  How much will you need?
[03:07:41.720 --> 03:07:42.720]  We don't know.
[03:07:42.720 --> 03:07:43.720]  How much do you want?
[03:07:43.720 --> 03:07:44.720]  All you can get.
[03:07:44.720 --> 03:07:45.720]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:07:45.720 --> 03:07:53.400]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day, call 1-800-409-5633 or check it
[03:07:53.400 --> 03:08:06.400]  out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com, again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:08:06.400 --> 03:08:11.160]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[03:08:11.160 --> 03:08:12.160]  You want answers?
[03:08:12.160 --> 03:08:20.760]  Well, so does he, he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now live from Austin,
[03:08:20.760 --> 03:08:22.000]  Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:22.000 --> 03:08:27.520]  We are now eight minutes into this fourth and final hour.
[03:08:27.520 --> 03:08:33.720]  I want to recap some of the top stories, most important news dealing with the government,
[03:08:33.720 --> 03:08:39.040]  takeover of healthcare, the American people literally going into socialist bondage.
[03:08:39.040 --> 03:08:45.480]  Then we're going to go to your phone calls and get into a host of other important news,
[03:08:45.480 --> 03:08:49.360]  including an excellent article written by Chuck Baldwin that's up on infowars.com and
[03:08:49.360 --> 03:08:55.400]  prismplanet.com, dates that destroyed America, and I wholeheartedly agree with his analysis.
[03:08:55.400 --> 03:09:03.720]  We're going to break that down towards the end of the broadcast today.
[03:09:03.720 --> 03:09:10.080]  This Senate passes reconciliation bill and sends it back to the U.S. House.
[03:09:10.080 --> 03:09:15.560]  Meanwhile, Barack Obama is challenging Republicans saying, quote, go for it.
[03:09:15.560 --> 03:09:20.680]  Obama tells GOP on health repeal, and he's got all these little kids up on TV with them
[03:09:20.680 --> 03:09:24.360]  saying, thanks for giving me healthcare for my preexisting condition.
[03:09:24.360 --> 03:09:26.880]  Oh, you're so great.
[03:09:26.880 --> 03:09:31.920]  What the Republican leadership won't tell you is, and Bloomberg and Business Week and
[03:09:31.920 --> 03:09:35.880]  the Wall Street Journal will, is the insurance companies wrote this stinking thing and their
[03:09:35.880 --> 03:09:40.320]  stocks are going way up, not the little insurance companies, the medium-sized ones, the big
[03:09:40.320 --> 03:09:41.320]  ones.
[03:09:41.320 --> 03:09:44.800]  This allows them to lower the standard of care under government control with the IRS
[03:09:44.800 --> 03:09:46.840]  telling you what healthcare you can and can't have.
[03:09:46.840 --> 03:09:52.720]  It forces 30-plus million people to buy insurance they don't want or need, sets a very dangerous
[03:09:52.720 --> 03:09:53.840]  precedent.
[03:09:53.840 --> 03:10:00.160]  Again, here is the Associated Press, the big dirty secret gap in healthcare law protection
[03:10:00.160 --> 03:10:04.800]  for children under the new law insurance companies still would be able to refuse new coverage
[03:10:04.800 --> 03:10:09.360]  to children because of a preexisting medical problem.
[03:10:09.360 --> 03:10:12.800]  That was the spokeswoman for the House Energy and Commerce Committee said.
[03:10:12.800 --> 03:10:14.280]  And I went and looked up the subsection.
[03:10:14.280 --> 03:10:15.280]  It is there.
[03:10:15.280 --> 03:10:19.600]  It has a national ID card for healthcare that everybody has to have in the subsection.
[03:10:19.600 --> 03:10:22.440]  I'll just go ahead and show you the subsection right now.
[03:10:22.440 --> 03:10:25.120]  I keep getting emails saying we're making this up.
[03:10:25.120 --> 03:10:34.280]  Here is page 65 of the past House bill, section B, subsection I, eligibility for health plan.
[03:10:34.280 --> 03:10:40.040]  And right here, at the end, it says allow for the use of a machine readable identification
[03:10:40.040 --> 03:10:41.840]  card for healthcare.
[03:10:41.840 --> 03:10:42.840]  Okay?
[03:10:42.840 --> 03:10:48.800]  They got another bill to force citizens to have a national ID card to have any job that
[03:10:48.800 --> 03:10:52.800]  the IRS regulates and watches and it's in the healthcare bill where they take your money
[03:10:52.800 --> 03:10:55.040]  directly out of your account.
[03:10:55.040 --> 03:10:59.240]  They take your refund and here's the associated press.
[03:10:59.240 --> 03:11:04.160]  U.S. citizens may need national ID cards to work if bill passes.
[03:11:04.160 --> 03:11:09.200]  And Lindsey Graham's got a bill to arrest U.S. citizens and allow, quote, enhanced interrogation
[03:11:09.200 --> 03:11:15.400]  for any intelligence reason or reason by the president.
[03:11:15.400 --> 03:11:17.200]  And I just can't believe it.
[03:11:17.200 --> 03:11:23.840]  Rush Limbaugh 15 years ago was a lot more hardcore on the 2nd Amendment and other issues.
[03:11:23.840 --> 03:11:28.820]  Over time, he got pretty bad because he was under a lot of political pressure and in trouble
[03:11:28.820 --> 03:11:33.560]  for Hillbilly heroin and everything else.
[03:11:33.560 --> 03:11:34.560]  But I didn't judge him.
[03:11:34.560 --> 03:11:39.480]  Anybody from paying can get addicted to OxyContin, but when he says have mandatory sentencing
[03:11:39.480 --> 03:11:43.960]  for people that use other illegal drugs and put them in jail for 25 years, that's hypocritical.
[03:11:43.960 --> 03:11:45.040]  But I've got to commend him.
[03:11:45.040 --> 03:11:46.920]  He's saying world government is here.
[03:11:46.920 --> 03:11:48.360]  New World Order is here.
[03:11:48.360 --> 03:11:49.360]  Government takeover.
[03:11:49.360 --> 03:11:50.640]  A globalist elite.
[03:11:50.640 --> 03:11:52.120]  They may suspend the elections.
[03:11:52.120 --> 03:11:53.640]  We're in a police state.
[03:11:53.640 --> 03:11:57.760]  Here I read some of his quotes from yesterday's show, so we commend Rush Limbaugh.
[03:11:57.760 --> 03:12:01.800]  I will always commend anybody that starts telling the truth.
[03:12:01.800 --> 03:12:06.480]  But that tells you how much trouble we're in, how serious this is.
[03:12:06.480 --> 03:12:11.160]  And I agree with Michael Savage six months ago when he said Obama will stage, back cue
[03:12:11.160 --> 03:12:16.800]  that up, Savage says Obama may stage Reichstag.
[03:12:16.800 --> 03:12:19.520]  I've been saying this forever because it's not Obama.
[03:12:19.520 --> 03:12:22.280]  It's the people that run Obama.
[03:12:22.280 --> 03:12:27.200]  When stage terror attacks, Democrats do it.
[03:12:27.200 --> 03:12:29.960]  And they're really starting to get scared of the American people because they know we're
[03:12:29.960 --> 03:12:30.960]  waking up.
[03:12:30.960 --> 03:12:38.520]  And continuing with the health bill, this is out of Politico, okay, politico.com.
[03:12:38.520 --> 03:12:41.160]  Health bill exempt top Hill staff.
[03:12:41.160 --> 03:12:44.160]  Not all the members of the House are not all their staffers.
[03:12:44.160 --> 03:12:48.760]  The Democratic leadership, the leadership of all the committees, they are exempt from
[03:12:48.760 --> 03:12:50.720]  having to be part of the health bill.
[03:12:50.720 --> 03:12:54.680]  Here is the prisonplanet.com article by Steve Watson that details it even more and has the
[03:12:54.680 --> 03:13:01.800]  subsection of the bill, page 158, loophole exempts Washington insiders from Obamacare.
[03:13:01.800 --> 03:13:04.800]  Not just members of the House, it's other special groups.
[03:13:04.800 --> 03:13:09.400]  The sergeant of arms, Obama and others, you can see some of my doodling there.
[03:13:09.400 --> 03:13:12.760]  That's the problem with printing these articles out for prisonplanet.tv viewers.
[03:13:12.760 --> 03:13:15.960]  Long before I saw them, we'll cast the radio show with live webcams.
[03:13:15.960 --> 03:13:20.480]  I would doodle on articles so you get to see my doodling for people that aren't just
[03:13:20.480 --> 03:13:22.920]  listening on the radio.
[03:13:22.920 --> 03:13:32.120]  So that is a very, very important area of this legislation.
[03:13:32.120 --> 03:13:37.800]  I don't know if I'm going to get to this, if I'm going to have time, but it's uponinfowars.com.
[03:13:37.800 --> 03:13:41.880]  War criminal Bush demonstrates his contempt for humanity.
[03:13:41.880 --> 03:13:47.320]  And Curt Nimmel wrote this article, but it's worse than what Curt even puts in the story.
[03:13:47.320 --> 03:13:54.520]  It shows Bush, George W. with Clinton, another criminal, in Haiti, and Bill Clinton shaking
[03:13:54.520 --> 03:13:59.200]  all the Haitians' hands, and a Haitian reaches out to Bush and he shakes his hand.
[03:13:59.200 --> 03:14:01.080]  And it's not that Bush wipes his hand off.
[03:14:01.080 --> 03:14:04.680]  The guy may have had something on his hand.
[03:14:04.680 --> 03:14:10.760]  Bush acts like he's patting Clinton on the arm, and Clinton turns around, but he's rubbing
[03:14:10.760 --> 03:14:19.160]  the sweat or the snot or whatever it is off on Clinton's arm.
[03:14:19.160 --> 03:14:24.680]  And it just shows, if you know psychology, how sadistic and psychopathic and sociopathic
[03:14:24.680 --> 03:14:29.760]  Bush is, that even a former president of the U.S., one of his peers, he reaches over like
[03:14:29.760 --> 03:14:34.760]  he's being his friend, but he goes, ugh, and starts wiping it off on him.
[03:14:34.760 --> 03:14:39.480]  Again, it's just a window into the nastiness of George W. Bush.
[03:14:39.480 --> 03:14:43.240]  And who tripled the size of government, Patriot Act, all of it.
[03:14:43.240 --> 03:14:45.440]  Remember, all of these guys are out of control.
[03:14:45.440 --> 03:14:47.640]  They've all got to be voted out.
[03:14:47.640 --> 03:14:53.480]  That's why the Republican Party's going after Rand Paul in Kentucky, who's 10 points ahead.
[03:14:53.480 --> 03:14:59.240]  They've got the head of elections in the state running against him, and the ethics board
[03:14:59.240 --> 03:15:03.800]  says he is allowed for the first time ever.
[03:15:03.800 --> 03:15:08.600]  Every state has laws that the ballot counters, the people running the ballots can't be on
[03:15:08.600 --> 03:15:09.600]  the ballot.
[03:15:09.600 --> 03:15:10.600]  Well, they don't care now.
[03:15:10.600 --> 03:15:13.600]  So, it doesn't matter if Rand Paul's 10 points ahead.
[03:15:13.600 --> 03:15:16.000]  If we don't make a big deal out of this, he's not going to win, and that's going to send
[03:15:16.000 --> 03:15:17.680]  shockwaves across the country.
[03:15:17.680 --> 03:15:22.160]  The Republican Party, the mainline neocons have said, we've got to beat Rand Paul.
[03:15:22.160 --> 03:15:27.680]  They've written editorials, or real grassroots is going to take over, and our party's over.
[03:15:27.680 --> 03:15:29.640]  Your party is over, scum.
[03:15:29.640 --> 03:15:30.640]  It's not just Democrats.
[03:15:30.640 --> 03:15:31.720]  They're going to get voted out.
[03:15:31.720 --> 03:15:33.640]  Lindsey Graham needs to be out of there.
[03:15:33.640 --> 03:15:34.720]  He's a nightmare.
[03:15:34.720 --> 03:15:39.320]  He supports the carbon tax that will kill what's left of our economy.
[03:15:39.320 --> 03:15:48.560]  Now, in other news, Osama bin Laden in tape threatens to kill Americans, and in the Reuters
[03:15:48.560 --> 03:15:52.440]  and AP articles, it then admits, oh, we don't know if this is really him.
[03:15:52.440 --> 03:15:55.280]  They just put out more fake tapes to scare everybody.
[03:15:55.280 --> 03:16:02.120]  Now, on the police state front, listen to this article, cops in New Jersey town gives
[03:16:02.120 --> 03:16:04.360]  keys to homes.
[03:16:04.360 --> 03:16:07.160]  They have already the government watching kids at home with their government laptops.
[03:16:07.160 --> 03:16:11.720]  You already have cameras going into school showers and locker rooms all over the country.
[03:16:11.720 --> 03:16:18.120]  We already have the Houston police chief last year proposing cameras in everybody's homes.
[03:16:18.120 --> 03:16:22.840]  Franklin Township police set up realtor like lock boxes so officers can respond immediately
[03:16:22.840 --> 03:16:27.600]  to emergencies, and they're just showing up saying, this is what you use on your door
[03:16:27.600 --> 03:16:28.600]  now.
[03:16:28.600 --> 03:16:29.720]  Oklahoma passed a law.
[03:16:29.720 --> 03:16:33.360]  You can't have burglar bars on your house so the criminal government can break in and
[03:16:33.360 --> 03:16:36.040]  soak in the criminals.
[03:16:36.040 --> 03:16:40.280]  It's a novel program designed to improve the safety of senior citizens in New Jersey.
[03:16:40.280 --> 03:16:43.840]  We now see these reports about cops try people's doors to see if they're open.
[03:16:43.840 --> 03:16:44.840]  They have knock and talk.
[03:16:44.840 --> 03:16:49.160]  They come and knock on your door and say, can we see if your guns are legal?
[03:16:49.160 --> 03:16:52.960]  And then now in Boston, they just force their way in.
[03:16:52.960 --> 03:16:56.360]  The program would allow police quick access into a home to help anyone having a medical
[03:16:56.360 --> 03:17:02.360]  emergency without having to break down the door.
[03:17:02.360 --> 03:17:06.440]  And this is just the total domestication, and I'm going to talk about that coming up
[03:17:06.440 --> 03:17:09.800]  at the bottom of the hour.
[03:17:09.800 --> 03:17:11.080]  I mean, here's Fox News.
[03:17:11.080 --> 03:17:12.840]  Should government regulate what we eat?
[03:17:12.840 --> 03:17:19.000]  And it says the feds are announcing they're going to put taxes on food, salt, grease,
[03:17:19.000 --> 03:17:22.320]  just and then surveil everything you're doing.
[03:17:22.320 --> 03:17:24.880]  Let's jam in a few phone calls in these next few segments.
[03:17:24.880 --> 03:17:27.160]  I'm going to go back into the news.
[03:17:27.160 --> 03:17:29.040]  Let's talk to Fred in Iowa.
[03:17:29.040 --> 03:17:31.040]  Fred, you're on the air.
[03:17:31.040 --> 03:17:38.000]  I've been calling into the major talk radio station here in Iowa for the last two and
[03:17:38.000 --> 03:17:39.600]  a half years.
[03:17:39.600 --> 03:17:42.640]  In the last few days, I've seen a major turnaround.
[03:17:42.640 --> 03:17:46.240]  How long that will last, I don't know.
[03:17:46.240 --> 03:17:53.480]  But the hosts are asking the candidates for Congress and the Senate really the tough questions,
[03:17:53.480 --> 03:17:56.680]  like the kind of questions you would ask.
[03:17:56.680 --> 03:18:04.800]  And I would strongly suggest to your listeners to don't give up, because I know what it does
[03:18:04.800 --> 03:18:06.880]  to get overwhelmed at times.
[03:18:06.880 --> 03:18:12.680]  To call into these talk radio shows and be civil, but keep punching away to try to get
[03:18:12.680 --> 03:18:13.680]  the message in.
[03:18:13.680 --> 03:18:14.680]  Exactly.
[03:18:14.680 --> 03:18:16.440]  Let me add this, Fred.
[03:18:16.440 --> 03:18:17.960]  People always say, what are the solutions?
[03:18:17.960 --> 03:18:20.040]  All we're giving people is solutions.
[03:18:20.040 --> 03:18:24.480]  Have grand juries start criminal investigations, have all the payoffs to get this bill passed.
[03:18:24.480 --> 03:18:27.320]  In fact, I saw a story about that in the news today.
[03:18:27.320 --> 03:18:33.440]  They're looking at criminal investigations over giving senators, family members, jobs
[03:18:33.440 --> 03:18:34.440]  to vote.
[03:18:34.440 --> 03:18:35.440]  In fact, I forgot that article.
[03:18:35.440 --> 03:18:36.440]  It's not in my stack.
[03:18:36.440 --> 03:18:38.000]  It was on Drudge.
[03:18:38.000 --> 03:18:40.280]  Print that for me, please.
[03:18:40.280 --> 03:18:44.040]  And take the states back, nullify this, sue over it.
[03:18:44.040 --> 03:18:49.780]  But the power of the average citizen to call into liberal and conservative radio and bring
[03:18:49.780 --> 03:18:54.080]  up real issues and reach hundreds of thousands if not millions of people.
[03:18:54.080 --> 03:18:56.280]  We are the true voice.
[03:18:56.280 --> 03:18:57.920]  We are the American people.
[03:18:57.920 --> 03:19:00.040]  We are the Constitution.
[03:19:00.040 --> 03:19:04.720]  And I'm seeing major radio executives that have contacted me, some of them contacted
[03:19:04.720 --> 03:19:07.480]  me years ago, who finally know this is real.
[03:19:07.480 --> 03:19:09.600]  They finally know we were right.
[03:19:09.600 --> 03:19:12.280]  And so a lot of people weren't controlled.
[03:19:12.280 --> 03:19:14.360]  They just were programmed.
[03:19:14.360 --> 03:19:16.760]  And so they're breaking out of the programming, Fred.
[03:19:16.760 --> 03:19:22.080]  Well, Alex, I understand what you're saying, but let this go out to people that seem like
[03:19:22.080 --> 03:19:25.720]  they're ineffectual or a little bit intimidated.
[03:19:25.720 --> 03:19:27.360]  You've got to keep punching.
[03:19:27.360 --> 03:19:32.320]  I've been a prison planet for seven months.
[03:19:32.320 --> 03:19:37.480]  And the sign I got on my pick up in this little town has really got me in some hot water.
[03:19:37.480 --> 03:19:40.480]  And you probably know what that is.
[03:19:40.480 --> 03:19:42.200]  But you've got to keep punching.
[03:19:42.200 --> 03:19:44.440]  I'm talking to people out there old and young.
[03:19:44.440 --> 03:19:46.000]  I'm an old fool.
[03:19:46.000 --> 03:19:47.000]  You've got to be...
[03:19:47.000 --> 03:19:48.000]  Well, Fred, stay there.
[03:19:48.000 --> 03:19:49.000]  Fred, stay there.
[03:19:49.000 --> 03:19:50.480]  I want to find out what's on your car.
[03:19:50.480 --> 03:19:54.840]  When we come back from this quick break, because I don't know what it is.
[03:19:54.840 --> 03:19:55.840]  What is it?
[03:19:55.840 --> 03:19:58.600]  Infowars.com and what?
[03:19:58.600 --> 03:20:01.880]  In Land of the Free, Home of the Brave, you can't have that?
[03:20:01.880 --> 03:20:04.760]  Are you prepared or are you hardcore prepared?
[03:20:04.760 --> 03:20:06.360]  There is a difference.

[03:21:01.800 --> 03:21:06.000]  Jim Newcomer with Midas Resources, talking today about change, not the change we were
[03:21:06.000 --> 03:21:10.080]  promised by President Obama, but the reality that we must face in these changing economic
[03:21:10.080 --> 03:21:11.080]  times.
[03:21:11.080 --> 03:21:15.200]  With our national debt currently exceeding $12.5 trillion and our unfunded liabilities
[03:21:15.200 --> 03:21:20.240]  totaling over $107 trillion, the value of the U.S. dollar continues its slide into oblivion.
[03:21:20.240 --> 03:21:24.040]  There's still time to ensure your financial security with precious metals, but you need
[03:21:24.040 --> 03:21:25.240]  to act today.
[03:21:25.240 --> 03:21:32.080]  Call me, Jim Newcomer, at 800-686-2237, extension 104, and we can explore how Midas Resources
[03:21:32.080 --> 03:21:34.320]  can help you secure your financial future.
[03:21:34.320 --> 03:21:37.680]  With our government continuing to find new ways to spend our money at the expense of
[03:21:37.680 --> 03:21:41.640]  our children and grandchildren, there's still time to acquire a true hedge against inflation
[03:21:41.640 --> 03:21:42.880]  with precious metals.
[03:21:42.880 --> 03:21:49.280]  Call me, Jim Newcomer, at 800-686-2237, extension 104, and we'll discuss how you can take physical
[03:21:49.280 --> 03:21:53.960]  possession or convert your IRA into precious metals before it's too late.
[03:21:53.960 --> 03:21:59.520]  800-686-2237, extension 104, and make the commitment today to retain the security you
[03:21:59.520 --> 03:22:03.520]  worked a lifetime to establish.
[03:22:03.520 --> 03:22:07.280]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:22:07.280 --> 03:22:10.080]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:22:10.080 --> 03:22:14.760]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[03:22:14.760 --> 03:22:15.760]  at home.
[03:22:15.760 --> 03:22:20.400]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are
[03:22:20.400 --> 03:22:21.520]  calling the shots.
[03:22:21.520 --> 03:22:26.680]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:22:26.680 --> 03:22:32.240]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel,
[03:22:32.240 --> 03:22:36.920]  hell-bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:22:36.920 --> 03:22:39.320]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[03:22:39.320 --> 03:22:43.440]  They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:22:43.440 --> 03:22:48.840]  Today, it seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen
[03:22:48.840 --> 03:22:50.640]  a fall of the Republic.
[03:22:50.640 --> 03:22:55.120]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.

[03:23:06.320 --> 03:23:08.320]  Afraid to answer it?

[03:23:10.280 --> 03:23:14.480]  Did you know that debt settlement, bankruptcy, and attorneys will cost you about 10 times
[03:23:14.480 --> 03:23:17.600]  more than you would legally be required to pay creditors?
[03:23:17.600 --> 03:23:19.760]  These are not ways to help you get out of debt.
[03:23:19.760 --> 03:23:21.800]  They are expensive payment plans.
[03:23:21.800 --> 03:23:25.880]  And if you're in debt already, does it make sense to load yourself up with another payment
[03:23:25.880 --> 03:23:26.880]  plan?
[03:23:26.880 --> 03:23:31.040]  Zero debt in 90 days gets you out of debt in 90 days, guaranteed.

[03:24:25.640 --> 03:24:32.120]  The power of true patriots flooding talk radio and never shutting up and demanding trees
[03:24:32.120 --> 03:24:34.800]  and investigations and criminal investigations.
[03:24:34.800 --> 03:24:41.120]  In fact, the headline on that article was House members call for special prosecutor over
[03:24:41.120 --> 03:24:42.520]  jobs for votes.
[03:24:42.520 --> 03:24:43.520]  That was the headline.
[03:24:43.520 --> 03:24:45.120]  I just remembered the exact headline.
[03:24:45.120 --> 03:24:47.840]  Okay, Fred, you got cut off by the break.
[03:24:47.840 --> 03:24:48.840]  You're in Iowa.
[03:24:48.840 --> 03:24:51.200]  You're saying you've got a bumper sticker that's gotten you in hot water.
[03:24:51.200 --> 03:24:52.200]  Tell us about it.
[03:24:52.200 --> 03:24:53.200]  Yes, it is.
[03:24:53.200 --> 03:24:58.040]  I want to make some points, too, but I think it would be helpful, you know, anyhow, I
[03:24:58.040 --> 03:25:03.040]  got the inside job in the ample wars on the bottom.
[03:25:03.040 --> 03:25:04.040]  And what happens?
[03:25:04.040 --> 03:25:06.440]  I mean, how's it gotten you in hot water?
[03:25:06.440 --> 03:25:14.080]  Well, I tell you the truth, I don't want to go into it to any deeper, you know, in any
[03:25:14.080 --> 03:25:15.080]  depth.
[03:25:15.080 --> 03:25:16.320]  I'm not trying to be a vassal.
[03:25:16.320 --> 03:25:20.640]  No, no, it's okay, but have you been harassed over it?
[03:25:20.640 --> 03:25:25.720]  Not really when people see the sign, except more often than not, I have to bring their
[03:25:25.720 --> 03:25:27.440]  attention to it.
[03:25:27.440 --> 03:25:33.840]  But talking to some of the city people here, let me put it that way, it got a little hairy
[03:25:33.840 --> 03:25:37.280]  and the police.
[03:25:37.280 --> 03:25:41.920]  But could I make some, hold on, they didn't imply that you weren't allowed to have that
[03:25:41.920 --> 03:25:43.520]  bumper sticker, did they?
[03:25:43.520 --> 03:25:48.080]  Like that, you know, wait a minute, so I was right because I've seen this over and over
[03:25:48.080 --> 03:25:49.080]  again.
[03:25:49.080 --> 03:25:53.280]  And I wanted to tell you, you can't have 9-11 was an inside job on it.
[03:25:53.280 --> 03:25:57.440]  Nobody has told me that, Alex, but what did they tell you then?
[03:25:57.440 --> 03:26:03.200]  Well, this is went back, you know, when I've been talking about the flu epidemic and all
[03:26:03.200 --> 03:26:08.120]  this and all the way through and, you know, I've talked to a few people and they said
[03:26:08.120 --> 03:26:15.840]  it was all hooey and all lies, you know, and they would not say anything detrimental to
[03:26:15.840 --> 03:26:20.040]  the, anything about the flu epidemic and all that.
[03:26:20.040 --> 03:26:24.280]  So, you were exposing it as a fraud and they disagree with you, now it's admitted it was
[03:26:24.280 --> 03:26:25.280]  a fraud.
[03:26:25.280 --> 03:26:26.920]  Get into the other points you wanted to make, Fred.
[03:26:26.920 --> 03:26:33.680]  Okay, Alex, there's people like me that are intimidated or they get fearful at times,
[03:26:33.680 --> 03:26:37.560]  but you got to keep punching, I'm not saying I'm a brave guy, I'm not a bar room fighter
[03:26:37.560 --> 03:26:39.920]  anymore, I'm 72.
[03:26:39.920 --> 03:26:45.400]  But you got to keep going and I like this talk radio, I've been working on this for
[03:26:45.400 --> 03:26:52.680]  two and a half years and now with everything that's happening right now politically, these
[03:26:52.680 --> 03:27:00.280]  guys' hosts have got cover and they're getting more courage, but you got to have callers
[03:27:00.280 --> 03:27:05.520]  that call in that kind of back them up or bring it to their attention and other people's
[03:27:05.520 --> 03:27:12.160]  attention and then they don't have to be the lone ranger there by themselves.
[03:27:12.160 --> 03:27:22.560]  And I had a multitude of ways, talk radio, which is the fourth of state, is how we get
[03:27:22.560 --> 03:27:23.720]  the word out.
[03:27:23.720 --> 03:27:28.520]  And we real patriots have to take it over for the mainline Republicans, thank you, Fred,
[03:27:28.520 --> 03:27:29.520]  and we are doing that.
[03:27:29.520 --> 03:27:32.360]  Jim in California, you're on the air.
[03:27:32.360 --> 03:27:36.480]  Hey, Alex, this is Jim in California.
[03:27:36.480 --> 03:27:42.040]  I got in the car today to go on a ride and NPR was on and two shows in a row.
[03:27:42.040 --> 03:27:45.560]  All they're talking about is how patriots are racists, people against the healthcare
[03:27:45.560 --> 03:27:46.560]  bill are racists.
[03:27:46.560 --> 03:27:48.560]  It was really incredible.
[03:27:48.560 --> 03:27:55.120]  Well, they do that to invoke race as poverty pimps to make all the majority groups, minorities
[03:27:55.120 --> 03:28:00.080]  are a majority in many states now, hate white people and to get us all fighting with each
[03:28:00.080 --> 03:28:02.800]  other, it's classic divide and conquer.
[03:28:02.800 --> 03:28:09.080]  They are the racists, Mecha, LaRaza, the government, they are the ones that want us to all fight
[03:28:09.080 --> 03:28:13.040]  with each other and it's disgusting and people see right through it.
[03:28:13.040 --> 03:28:16.040]  Yeah, it was incredible on fresh air.
[03:28:16.040 --> 03:28:20.920]  They had the guy who writes for Southern Poverty Law Center's intelligence report for an hour.
[03:28:20.920 --> 03:28:26.280]  And it just completely blew me away, just wanted to let you know, and the only dovetail
[03:28:26.280 --> 03:28:30.200]  to that is how do I get your show on the radio up your dress, call radio stations and ask
[03:28:30.200 --> 03:28:31.200]  him or...
[03:28:31.200 --> 03:28:36.280]  We're only on, what, four affiliates, which is pretty good in California, but absolutely,
[03:28:36.280 --> 03:28:40.400]  believe me, every station in the country's told us that they've gotten lots of calls
[03:28:40.400 --> 03:28:44.320]  and they know the show is popular and a lot of them are starting to turn it on.
[03:28:44.320 --> 03:28:48.960]  And for all these years, oh, there's not world government, there's not a banking takeover,
[03:28:48.960 --> 03:28:52.640]  there's not government sponsored terror, the government's not watching you off your laptop
[03:28:52.640 --> 03:28:57.040]  cameras, oh, the government isn't putting poison in the water, oh, the UN doesn't want
[03:28:57.040 --> 03:28:58.760]  to reduce our population.
[03:28:58.760 --> 03:29:04.640]  Now you go to Drudge Report almost any day, he's got mainstream links, mainstream papers
[03:29:04.640 --> 03:29:09.280]  admitting this, so the denial is over, and I'm going to talk about that when we come
[03:29:09.280 --> 03:29:11.160]  back in the next segment.
[03:29:11.160 --> 03:29:13.760]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:29:13.760 --> 03:29:17.760]  Thank you so much, Jim, and we will get to Shannon, Steve, Kenny and Kevin before the
[03:29:17.760 --> 03:29:23.120]  show ends, but I'm going to come back and get into the fact that we've been right all
[03:29:23.120 --> 03:29:26.120]  along, that we've told it like it is.
[03:29:26.120 --> 03:29:31.920]  And because we did talk about these issues when it was unpopular, people now remember,
[03:29:31.920 --> 03:29:36.200]  and they remember seeing the films and hearing the radio shows and reading the books that
[03:29:36.200 --> 03:29:41.160]  many others put out, and we were right, and so our credibility is rising, so they're
[03:29:41.160 --> 03:29:44.480]  going to say we're violent, they're going to say we're racist, they're going to try
[03:29:44.480 --> 03:29:48.800]  to radicalize everybody as Cass Sunstein said in the White House documents, it's not going
[03:29:48.800 --> 03:29:52.000]  to work, we'll be right back.
[03:29:52.000 --> 03:29:55.720]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.720 --> 03:30:24.040]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:24.040 --> 03:30:44.320]  They
[03:30:44.320 --> 03:30:56.320]  give them a call at 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds
[03:30:56.320 --> 03:31:03.520]  are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[03:31:03.520 --> 03:31:08.040]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last
[03:31:08.040 --> 03:31:10.080]  chance to not relive history.
[03:31:10.080 --> 03:31:14.760]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[03:31:14.760 --> 03:31:15.760]  at home.
[03:31:15.760 --> 03:31:20.400]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are
[03:31:20.400 --> 03:31:21.400]  calling the shots.
[03:31:21.400 --> 03:31:26.680]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:31:26.680 --> 03:31:32.240]  Full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel,
[03:31:32.240 --> 03:31:36.920]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:31:36.920 --> 03:31:41.240]  Jim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches, and the Congress
[03:31:41.240 --> 03:31:43.240]  is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:31:43.240 --> 03:31:48.760]  Today, it seems like nobody does care. And right now, in Washington, D.C., we have seen
[03:31:48.760 --> 03:31:50.600]  a fall of the republic.
[03:31:50.600 --> 03:31:56.440]  Yet you're copy a fall of the republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're watching online
[03:31:56.440 --> 03:32:00.320]  right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[03:32:00.320 --> 03:32:05.600]  Hi, everyone. Andy Anderson here. Are you using those little bottles of hand gel that
[03:32:05.600 --> 03:32:10.040]  kill germs, bacteria, and other nasties? In today's world, that's smart, especially
[03:32:10.040 --> 03:32:13.760]  with the filthy doorknobs, shopping carts, and handrails we touch every day.
[03:32:13.760 --> 03:32:18.080]  Did you know that once the alcohol evaporates in a few seconds, goodbye effectiveness? No
[03:32:18.080 --> 03:32:20.000]  more protection till you use it again.
[03:32:20.000 --> 03:32:21.280]  Pure Works to the rescue.

[03:40:29.800 --> 03:40:33.800]  It's the same reason we let somebody else fight the banks or somebody else fight the UN
[03:40:33.800 --> 03:40:36.800]  or somebody else fight the healthcare takeover or somebody else.
[03:40:36.800 --> 03:40:38.800]  Look, we've been right about it all.
[03:40:38.800 --> 03:40:43.800]  The UN takeover, the global banks, the surveillance, the stage terror, the police state,
[03:40:43.800 --> 03:40:47.800]  how they're going to use the military against the American people, the federalization of police,
[03:40:47.800 --> 03:40:50.800]  all this legislation to secretly arrest citizens and even torture us.
[03:40:50.800 --> 03:40:53.800]  I had Judge Napolitano going over it earlier.
[03:40:53.800 --> 03:40:56.800]  It's in the legislation that Lindsey Graham's introduced.
[03:40:56.800 --> 03:41:00.800]  Obama's saying he has the power to shut the Internet down over cybersecurity.
[03:41:00.800 --> 03:41:05.800]  Cass Sunstein, his regulations are saying that they want to shut down conspiracy theories.
[03:41:05.800 --> 03:41:09.800]  And he lists people that say man-made global warming isn't real.
[03:41:09.800 --> 03:41:11.800]  Anthropogenic global warming.
[03:41:11.800 --> 03:41:17.800]  I mean, there are tyrants, bona fide, signed, sealed and delivered, certified.
[03:41:17.800 --> 03:41:22.800]  There is no doubt that every other nation on Earth has fallen to tyranny in the past.
[03:41:22.800 --> 03:41:25.800]  We are falling. It doesn't have to happen.
[03:41:25.800 --> 03:41:30.800]  And that's why I'm so excited that not just people on the street are people that didn't like me in the past,
[03:41:30.800 --> 03:41:32.800]  but major radio executives.
[03:41:32.800 --> 03:41:36.800]  Some of the biggest in the country have called me in the last two weeks and have said,
[03:41:36.800 --> 03:41:39.800]  you are absolutely right about all this.
[03:41:39.800 --> 03:41:41.800]  We can't believe this is happening.
[03:41:41.800 --> 03:41:44.800]  We're going to try to figure out ways to get you on more stations nationwide.
[03:41:44.800 --> 03:41:49.800]  But the owners and shareholders of these companies are globalist.
[03:41:49.800 --> 03:41:51.800]  But we know we don't have any future.
[03:41:51.800 --> 03:41:55.800]  And that's why you hear Limbaugh saying new world order, world government, new world order,
[03:41:55.800 --> 03:41:59.800]  they want your guns, they may cancel the election, they may bring in martial law.
[03:41:59.800 --> 03:42:05.800]  In fact, can you queue up that savage clip from earlier and then we'll go to the Brinks clip?
[03:42:05.800 --> 03:42:06.800]  They can't listen.
[03:42:06.800 --> 03:42:08.800]  Listen, most people aren't government operatives in media.
[03:42:08.800 --> 03:42:14.800]  There are some and that's come out in congressional hearings that kind of set the ball rolling and put out the talking points.
[03:42:14.800 --> 03:42:17.800]  Most of them go according to what they think is popular.
[03:42:17.800 --> 03:42:22.800]  And oh, if it's a conspiracy theory to talk about a global government bank takeover plan,
[03:42:22.800 --> 03:42:25.800]  I better not talk about it even as it's happening.
[03:42:25.800 --> 03:42:30.800]  But now people are realizing this is a hot, oppressive, serious tyranny.
[03:42:30.800 --> 03:42:34.800]  This isn't something you can just stand back and go along with.
[03:42:34.800 --> 03:42:36.800]  Did you find it?
[03:42:36.800 --> 03:42:38.800]  Let's play a clip of Savage telling it like it is.
[03:42:38.800 --> 03:42:46.800]  Here it is.
[03:42:46.800 --> 03:42:51.800]  For some reason, this only ever happens in the fourth hour that the clips don't work.
[03:42:51.800 --> 03:42:54.800]  We'll try to play that towards the end of the show.
[03:42:54.800 --> 03:42:59.800]  Let's go ahead and play this Brinks clip.
[03:42:59.800 --> 03:43:12.800]  We're going to get this Brinks clip queued up here in a minute or so because I've been seeing these Brinks ads over and over and over and over and over again
[03:43:12.800 --> 03:43:15.800]  where it shows kids in danger with their mother.
[03:43:15.800 --> 03:43:19.800]  They're never a man in the house because what half the country doesn't even have men in the house now.
[03:43:19.800 --> 03:43:22.800]  They're domesticating us, bringing us into bondage scientifically.
[03:43:22.800 --> 03:43:30.800]  Or if there is a man in the house, they cower with the wife and children and the alarm goes off and Brinks calls and tells them they've called 911.
[03:43:30.800 --> 03:43:32.800]  You know, you can't even call 911 yourself.
[03:43:32.800 --> 03:43:35.800]  Brinks calls them for you.
[03:43:35.800 --> 03:43:39.800]  Or there's a guy at a party and nobody knows who he is and he tries to break in later.
[03:43:39.800 --> 03:43:43.800]  These women go and cower and talk to Brinks on the phone.
[03:43:43.800 --> 03:43:45.800]  Now I'm not saying it's bad to have an alarm.
[03:43:45.800 --> 03:43:46.800]  I think it's good.
[03:43:46.800 --> 03:43:56.800]  The problem here is that they're never show you that the woman goes and gets a gun as they do every day in this country and blast the criminal.
[03:43:56.800 --> 03:43:59.800]  So let's go ahead and play this Brinks clip.
[03:43:59.800 --> 03:44:00.800]  Here it is.
[03:44:00.800 --> 03:44:02.800]  Coming.
[03:44:02.800 --> 03:44:04.800]  It was really nice to meet you, AJ.
[03:44:04.800 --> 03:44:17.800]  Yeah, you too.
[03:44:17.800 --> 03:44:24.800]  AJ?
[03:44:24.800 --> 03:44:25.800]  Hello?
[03:44:25.800 --> 03:44:27.800]  This has been able to rob you of security. Is everything okay?
[03:44:27.800 --> 03:44:29.800]  Yeah, there's this guy. He just smashed in my door.
[03:44:29.800 --> 03:44:30.800]  I'm sending help right now.
[03:44:30.800 --> 03:44:31.800]  Thank you.

[03:45:01.800 --> 03:45:11.800]  Okay, so it's now broad view and I'm not bashing Brinks here, but these are anti-male ads targeting single women.
[03:45:11.800 --> 03:45:20.800]  And I mean, it's fine to have the Brinks to know somebody's breaking in, but isn't it better to have a firearm instead of cowering in fear?
[03:45:20.800 --> 03:45:27.800]  Now I want to go to Matt Ryan and Matt Ryan over the weekend. They called the Austin Police Department five times.
[03:45:27.800 --> 03:45:34.800]  This happened to his wife's niece. This guy has been convicted before for assaulting people.
[03:45:34.800 --> 03:45:41.800]  He said he was coming over to attack her with a chain. He did it, beat her bloody, and the police would never come.
[03:45:41.800 --> 03:45:47.800]  Now again, somebody calls and says, I'm coming over to your house with a chain. I'm going to tell them I'm going to defend myself.
[03:45:47.800 --> 03:45:54.800]  I advise you against it, but I'll be waiting. And if they start knocking the door down, I'm going to kill them.
[03:45:54.800 --> 03:46:01.800]  But again, talking to Matt, Matt's pro-second amendment, but this extended family of his is not.
[03:46:01.800 --> 03:46:07.800]  And so they're more afraid of guns than they are of people attacking them. Matt Ryan, tell us what happened.
[03:46:07.800 --> 03:46:14.800]  Alright, basically to go to the end of the story first, we did have to chase the guy off. Police showed up 20 minutes after he'd already left.
[03:46:14.800 --> 03:46:19.800]  A couple hours before, around 5 p.m., we made a call to APD. He said we're getting threatening calls.
[03:46:19.800 --> 03:46:26.800]  This guy says he's going to come over here. Violent intentions. He's not kidding around. He's already on probation for assault.
[03:46:26.800 --> 03:46:31.800]  He's got a record. Please send somebody over. The police said there's nothing they can do.
[03:46:31.800 --> 03:46:36.800]  We get another call about 10 minutes later. I called them myself. The operator-
[03:46:36.800 --> 03:46:46.800]  So he says I'm coming to assault you. He's got three arrests for this. He's on probation. You're telling him this. This goes on for two hours.
[03:46:46.800 --> 03:46:55.800]  Right. And the second time I called, the operator said we already have him in custody because of another domestic dispute across town that went on during that time.
[03:46:55.800 --> 03:47:03.800]  And I thought that was a little funny because we had just gotten off the phone with him. Well, he called 10 minutes later, so that operator was incorrect in assuring us that he was in custody.
[03:47:03.800 --> 03:47:06.800]  But again, they know they have no liability to protect you.
[03:47:06.800 --> 03:47:18.800]  Exactly. He keeps calling and essentially we have to call three times. On the fourth time, we're told finally an officer's on his way. We'll have him out there in a few minutes.
[03:47:18.800 --> 03:47:25.800]  About 20 minutes later, he shows up, catches our niece. She would just pulled up in the driveway. She was getting out of her car.
[03:47:25.800 --> 03:47:26.800]  He'd probably been waiting.
[03:47:26.800 --> 03:47:32.800]  Right. He assaults her and we have to fight him off. We fought him off. He starts driving down-
[03:47:32.800 --> 03:47:34.800]  Oh, so you went over there to protect her?
[03:47:34.800 --> 03:47:39.800]  Right. Well, basically the whole family rushed out. We were told to stay indoors, but when we saw her pulling up, saw that happen.
[03:47:39.800 --> 03:47:41.800]  Again, the police say stay indoors.
[03:47:41.800 --> 03:47:51.800]  Exactly. We rushed out. We fight the guy off and he escapes. 10 minutes later, they arrive and say, you know, we couldn't find him. I was busy handling his other problem downtown.
[03:47:51.800 --> 03:47:54.800]  And he probably won't even get in trouble with the probation officer.
[03:47:54.800 --> 03:48:00.800]  Right. And here's the guy who has warrants, active warrants. He's on probation. He's got a rap sheet a mile long.
[03:48:00.800 --> 03:48:07.800]  But the police were too busy last weekend doing a roundup for parking tickets. They call it a roundup, conditioning people to the term roundup, roundup.
[03:48:07.800 --> 03:48:12.800]  They say it real scary in radio ads and over 10% of the state has arrest warrants for petty things.
[03:48:12.800 --> 03:48:20.800]  They're too busy out collecting money from the slaves sucking off of us to actually respond to someone saying, I'm coming to attack you.
[03:48:20.800 --> 03:48:21.800]  Exactly.
[03:48:21.800 --> 03:48:25.800]  Now, let me tell you how that should have been handled. They should have been waiting in there with a gun.
[03:48:25.800 --> 03:48:28.800]  And when he pulled up an assaultor, they should have gone down and put that animal down.
[03:48:28.800 --> 03:48:30.800]  I totally agree. 100%.
[03:48:30.800 --> 03:48:35.800]  So now, thankfully, the family was there, so he wasn't able to beat her too bad, but you said she was bloodied.
[03:48:35.800 --> 03:48:41.800]  Yes. He basically had a heavy chain pulled it off, put it around his, his hand and assaulted her.
[03:48:41.800 --> 03:48:46.800]  She had a busted chin. She was bleeding. She was, you know, kind of out of it.
[03:48:46.800 --> 03:48:50.800]  When he had been chased off, she was, she was okay, thankfully.
[03:48:50.800 --> 03:48:56.800]  But yeah, he definitely did. He went at her with a weapon. We called the police said he's got a weapon.
[03:48:56.800 --> 03:49:01.800]  He's, he's, you know, beaten her. It still took them 20 minutes to show up.
[03:49:01.800 --> 03:49:06.800]  Well, I want to show viewers out there what we do here at this office.
[03:49:06.800 --> 03:49:09.800]  I mean, people with concealed carry. I don't have a concealed carry. It's my second amendment.
[03:49:09.800 --> 03:49:14.800]  You come around here with a chain and a gun looking for trouble. You're going to get trouble right back.
[03:49:14.800 --> 03:49:21.800]  This is the spirit of freedom. This is the attitude that we have to have in this country to defend ourselves and defend this Republic.
[03:49:21.800 --> 03:49:29.800]  The government will not protect you. They don't want to protect you. Even if they're good cops, their bosses want them out there sucking off of you.
[03:49:29.800 --> 03:49:40.800]  That's what's going on. That's what's happening. It's time to stop being scared of guns and start being scared of the corrupt government and criminals and to defend yourself.
[03:49:40.800 --> 03:49:45.800]  Matt Ryan, I mean, any other thoughts on this? You were telling me that now the family is going to get a gun.
[03:49:45.800 --> 03:49:51.800]  Absolutely. The family is going to get a gun. My wife and I are definitely going to get one concealed carry, whatever we have to do to protect ourselves.
[03:49:51.800 --> 03:49:59.800]  I do have one thing to say. A couple hours later, the cops said he's going to jail for this. A couple hours later, he calls from the address.
[03:49:59.800 --> 03:50:06.800]  We gave the cops to go pick him up and he was still making violent threats. I mean, the guy obviously didn't get chased down.
[03:50:06.800 --> 03:50:14.800]  No, no, no. It's come out in internal Chicago documents that they let the violent ones go to terrorize the public so they vote for more cops.
[03:50:14.800 --> 03:50:16.800]  So the cops can go out and raise, suck more money.
[03:50:16.800 --> 03:50:20.800]  Exactly. And if I get pulled over and my, my plates are out, I might go to jail.
[03:50:20.800 --> 03:50:26.800]  Well, that's in the news this week. It came out that states are all being ordered right more tickets. So they can't respond.
[03:50:26.800 --> 03:50:32.800]  There's more cops, but they can't respond to real crime because they've got to suck off the people.
[03:50:32.800 --> 03:50:33.800]  Exactly.
[03:50:33.800 --> 03:50:38.800]  Well, she needs to go get a firearm. She needs to take firearms training. She doesn't need to wave it at him or say anything.
[03:50:38.800 --> 03:50:44.800]  He starts trying to assault her. Just unload the revolver. That's the best gun to use, even if you're good with firearms.
[03:50:44.800 --> 03:50:50.800]  A revolver's good under stress. They don't malfunction very often. And folks, it's your right.
[03:50:50.800 --> 03:50:55.800]  If somebody's assaulting you or come in your house to do you harm or trying to rob you in your home, kill them.
[03:50:55.800 --> 03:51:01.800]  The government loves the criminals and protects them. All we can do is kill these murderers.
[03:51:01.800 --> 03:51:09.800]  George Washington said, government is not reason. It is not eloquence. It is force, like fire. It is a dangerous servant and a fearful master.
[03:51:09.800 --> 03:51:15.800]  America's government is no longer the servant of the people and the protector of our liberty, but has become that fearful master.
[03:51:15.800 --> 03:51:21.800]  We, the people, must understand the nature of this government gone awry if we are to be successful in saving our country.
[03:51:21.800 --> 03:51:28.800]  America is being deliberately destroyed by a cabal of international gangsters so that she can be forced into subjugation to a one world government.
[03:51:28.800 --> 03:51:36.800]  The God-given, unalienable rights of the Declaration of Independence are in jeopardy. We must not let them be stolen by ambitious and evil men.
[03:51:36.800 --> 03:51:42.800]  Utopia Silver Supplements believes it is our God-given right to make our own health care decisions, however we deem best.

[03:52:02.800 --> 03:52:09.800]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:52:09.800 --> 03:52:14.800]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:14.800 --> 03:52:20.800]  I've determined its influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:20.800 --> 03:52:25.800]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:25.800 --> 03:52:36.800]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:36.800 --> 03:52:42.800]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[03:52:42.800 --> 03:52:49.800]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[03:54:05.800 --> 03:54:14.800]  I'll make another prediction. I predict that very soon Obama will create a crisis along the lines of the Reichstag fire.
[03:54:14.800 --> 03:54:19.800]  I don't know what form it will take, but I believe that once the minions are seen for what they are,
[03:54:19.800 --> 03:54:24.800]  Ram-Emanuel and his gang will set off a Reichstag fire in this country of some kind,
[03:54:24.800 --> 03:54:32.800]  and they will recall the military dictatorship of Lincoln and Stanton during the Civil War when civilian suspects were arrested without warrant.
[03:54:32.800 --> 03:54:38.800]  I will tell you, as I sit here, I figure that every night as I go to sleep, I put nothing past these agitators.
[03:54:38.800 --> 03:54:45.800]  So, the idea of stage government terror is now being talked about on Savage, Limbaugh, everywhere.
[03:54:45.800 --> 03:54:50.800]  Hannity isn't doing it yet. We are forcing them to cover the real issues, and I commend it.
[03:54:50.800 --> 03:54:58.800]  There is no doubt that most of these bricks being thrown through and gunshots into a congressperson's office in Virginia are staged.
[03:54:58.800 --> 03:55:04.800]  They've caught the controlled left, painting swastikas on churches and dormitory walls.
[03:55:04.800 --> 03:55:10.800]  So many times, I can't even count. This is the reality.
[03:55:10.800 --> 03:55:16.800]  And we have to get serious. We have to get focused.
[03:55:16.800 --> 03:55:20.800]  But 10 years ago, they could alternate Republican and Democratic power,
[03:55:20.800 --> 03:55:23.800]  and then the Republicans would promise to end the tyranny and then would continue it.
[03:55:23.800 --> 03:55:26.800]  And the Democrats would promise and get back in power and continue it.
[03:55:26.800 --> 03:55:30.800]  And it would take years for people to wake up each time and then vote for the other party.
[03:55:30.800 --> 03:55:38.800]  Now, folks know that it's the incumbents, it's their voting records, it's system-wide, and people aren't mincing their words.
[03:55:38.800 --> 03:55:42.800]  And every time you talk about stage terror, every time you talk about New World Order,
[03:55:42.800 --> 03:55:47.800]  every time you talk about world government, every time you point out that we were right about man-made global warming,
[03:55:47.800 --> 03:55:53.800]  being a premeditated fraud, they've now been caught red-handed, they know it's a fraud, they want to control your life,
[03:55:53.800 --> 03:55:58.800]  they want amnesty this year, they want open borders, they want to pass the carbon tax,
[03:55:58.800 --> 03:56:01.800]  where they can selectively shut down any businesses they want.
[03:56:01.800 --> 03:56:07.800]  And the only way they're going to get this through is staging terror attacks to blame them on the Tea Party.
[03:56:07.800 --> 03:56:17.800]  And you see them in full mode right now, 100% pushing this idea and prepping everyone.
[03:56:17.800 --> 03:56:21.800]  And I've been predicting that in the month of April, late April,
[03:56:21.800 --> 03:56:25.800]  because I know there's five big TV documentaries about Tea Parties being evil and violent,
[03:56:25.800 --> 03:56:30.800]  being produced by major news networks and HBO to air in the middle and late April.
[03:56:30.800 --> 03:56:36.800]  And they're producing them because their bosses have given them the word to have this ready then,
[03:56:36.800 --> 03:56:41.800]  because I believe they're going to stage really horrible events coming up in late April.
[03:56:41.800 --> 03:56:44.800]  Remember, I predicted 9-11 two months before it happened.
[03:56:44.800 --> 03:56:47.800]  Just Google, Alex Jones predicts 9-11.
[03:56:47.800 --> 03:56:52.800]  And you'll see millions of views on those videos. And a lot of Austinites saw me do that live,
[03:56:52.800 --> 03:56:57.800]  syndicated radio audience, you heard me do show after show, because I saw the preparation.
[03:56:57.800 --> 03:57:00.800]  I saw them prepping everyone and getting them ready.
[03:57:00.800 --> 03:57:05.800]  And to all of you yuppies out there making $100, $200,000 a year that think you're part of the power structure
[03:57:05.800 --> 03:57:08.800]  and don't think you should be politically involved or think everything's okay or,
[03:57:08.800 --> 03:57:14.800]  oh, it's not as bad as Alex Jones says, it's worse than I can explain to you.
[03:57:14.800 --> 03:57:22.800]  This is a scientific criminal takeover and Obama is just the latest puppet, the latest frontman.
[03:57:22.800 --> 03:57:26.800]  And so read the health care bill for yourself.
[03:57:26.800 --> 03:57:30.800]  Just look at it for yourself. Realize what this means.
[03:57:30.800 --> 03:57:33.800]  Realize that offshore banks have robbed us blind.
[03:57:33.800 --> 03:57:37.800]  Realize that at every level, government is getting exponentially more and more brazen,
[03:57:37.800 --> 03:57:42.800]  more and more criminal, more and more wild-eyed, because they are going for broke.
[03:57:42.800 --> 03:57:47.800]  They have passed the point of no return. They can't stop now.
[03:57:47.800 --> 03:57:53.800]  And so it's two speed trains, liberty and tyranny, going head up against each other.
[03:57:53.800 --> 03:57:58.800]  And everyone who loves liberty, everyone who hates tyranny, everyone who wants to live in a free country
[03:57:58.800 --> 03:58:03.800]  and doesn't want themselves and their children to go into bondage has to stand up now.
[03:58:03.800 --> 03:58:09.800]  We are here waging war on corruption. We are here crashing through the lies and disinformation.
