[00:48.160 --> 00:52.880]  lot of amazing things I don't know two and a half three months ago when I was up there shooting a
[00:52.880 --> 00:58.960]  movie with him and Mike Norris and then a lot of what he talked about then later came out on
[00:58.960 --> 01:05.520]  the news and he's friends with Governor Greg Abbott as I told you I talked to Greg Abbott
[01:05.520 --> 01:09.640]  chief of staff yesterday I never really even gotten to what we talked about completely because
[01:09.640 --> 01:16.520]  he didn't say it was off record but I don't want to give the governor even more trouble the point
[01:16.520 --> 01:21.640]  as we know the governor is a patriot and is aware of what's happening with Jade Helm but Gary Haven
[01:21.640 --> 01:28.320]  will be joining us for an hour and a half at studio with Mike Norris and let me tell you I
[01:28.320 --> 01:31.640]  mean I knew who Mike Norris was because he's made some really big Christian movies that were
[01:31.640 --> 01:37.880]  blockbusters he's produced hundreds of major TV shows dozens of shows but hundreds of episodes
[01:37.880 --> 01:44.800]  and of course he's Chuck Norris' son and Chuck Norris has been on the show I don't know six
[01:44.800 --> 01:49.160]  seven times over the years and is a listener he we're proud of that fact in fact I'm told Chuck
[01:49.160 --> 01:56.960]  listens pretty much every day when he's out driving but they were laying a lot of really
[01:56.960 --> 02:03.320]  incredible stuff on me about how awake the state of Texas government is and we're now seeing a
[02:03.320 --> 02:10.200]  lot of that unfold and they didn't say it was off record but I just when I'm told stuff by
[02:10.200 --> 02:17.640]  people that's so amazing I tend to just not run out and blurt it but we'll see how much they talk
[02:17.640 --> 02:24.000]  about here on air today mainly Gary Haven we're gonna get some Chuck Norris stories that he was
[02:24.000 --> 02:31.840]  telling me and saying I can tell you know his firstborn son and I went and googled him and most
[02:31.840 --> 02:39.000]  of them weren't even known it's just really amazing all the things he was talking about I mean it's
[02:39.000 --> 02:44.240]  known that Chuck Norris was really good friends with Steve McQueen and that he learned martial
[02:44.240 --> 02:48.400]  arts from Chuck Norris that they rode motorcycles together and stuff me Steve McQueen was a man's
[02:48.400 --> 02:53.200]  man you know do an off-road motorcycle racing when he was 40 something years old up against 20
[02:53.200 --> 02:58.120]  year olds and winning but they were telling me he was telling all these Steve McQueen stories I'm
[02:58.120 --> 03:07.920]  a big Steve McQueen fan and just a celebration of Americana masculinity and Patriots because I don't
[03:07.920 --> 03:11.600]  get into Hollywood stuff I care less these guys don't live in Hollywood they live in Texas and
[03:11.600 --> 03:18.040]  they've gone against the grain of Hollywood and you know when Chuck Norris is a fan you got something
[03:18.040 --> 03:27.800]  going for you but it's exciting we're gonna have them in studio today they're I'm told now

[03:36.280 --> 03:45.680]  want to look about an hour and a half with Mike Norris and Gary Haven that said man I've got to
[03:45.680 --> 03:52.160]  cover these headlines which I almost always fail to cover them all the news just in two of my eight
[03:52.160 --> 03:57.560]  or nine stacks today the stacks are thicker today there's only eight or nine stacks are just over
[03:57.560 --> 04:03.640]  the top the good the bad the ugly great things bad things bizarre things incredible things very
[04:03.640 --> 04:10.680]  revealing things happening and going on but I just want to say this and I said this 10 years ago
[04:10.680 --> 04:17.120]  and I said it again last year and I'm saying it now Liberty is hotter than a pistol Liberty is
[04:17.120 --> 04:22.600]  hotter than a branding iron Liberty is hotter than a fiery furnace in the power structure
[04:22.600 --> 04:32.120]  I'm talking about famous defense company owners that I've talked to that I've run into it's like
[04:32.120 --> 04:36.120]  they'll come over and talk to me you know when I'm in some law office and I go look them up and
[04:36.120 --> 04:39.720]  it's like some person worth five billion dollars four billion dollars and they're just saying it's
[04:39.720 --> 04:45.320]  all true blah blah blah I'm going to I'm running to the Cook Islands or you go to Hollywood or you
[04:45.320 --> 04:50.040]  go to New York I mean the elite are the ones that are away because most of them aren't even part of
[04:50.040 --> 04:54.920]  the takeover they're just aware of an even more elite group we're talking a few dozen families
[04:54.920 --> 05:03.640]  that are running the whole show and they're scared as well so a Michigan senator joins a long list

[09:06.120 --> 09:10.280]  greg abin and others and told me i don't know two and a half three months ago when i was
[09:10.280 --> 09:17.320]  in north texas shooting a film with him and chuck norris's son mike norris who's just
[09:17.320 --> 09:23.800]  an amazing individual uh they were just telling me all this incredible stuff uh that obviously
[09:23.800 --> 09:28.040]  they'd been made privy to people like chuck norris have been made privy to and a lot of it then
[09:28.040 --> 09:36.440]  became sort of coming out in the news we have since then seen chuck norris come out and say he's
[09:36.440 --> 09:41.000]  concerned about jade helm not because he doesn't trust the military but because he doesn't trust
[09:41.000 --> 09:46.360]  obama who admittedly is training the military to confiscate guns and go after veterans in the tea
[09:46.360 --> 09:52.440]  party but then the guardian spends it deceptively texas ranger chuck norris warns of government
[09:52.440 --> 10:00.600]  plot to take over state no he didn't they actually go read his quotes he talked about how why aren't
[10:00.600 --> 10:05.560]  they on the border he talked about what louis gohmertz talked about the fact that the military
[10:05.560 --> 10:11.160]  has been ordered to train to take on gun owners and veterans and that's what congressman louis
[10:11.160 --> 10:16.520]  gohmertz of texas who's an army officer veteran himself he said i've never seen training exercises
[10:16.520 --> 10:21.960]  with these type of maps listing states hostile i have never and and and he talked about the
[10:21.960 --> 10:27.400]  training manuals to take on gun owners veterans conservatives libertarians i mean doesn't everyone
[10:27.400 --> 10:32.200]  understand that's been in hundreds of newspapers the media just keeps acting like we're crazy
[10:33.400 --> 10:39.160]  but there's a real fight over who controls the military and their mission and we're saying no
[10:39.160 --> 10:45.080]  unconstitutional missions the military is the main group saying no unconstitutional missions
[10:45.080 --> 10:54.840]  how do you think we at info wars dot com break probably 60 70 percent of the documents restricted
[10:54.840 --> 11:01.560]  you name it that come out of different military bases where they're saying the founding fathers
[11:01.560 --> 11:06.600]  are bad and gun owners are bad and christians are bad and racist and daily caller now had
[11:06.600 --> 11:13.160]  one of those two weeks ago as well and the defense department defended it so our military
[11:13.160 --> 11:19.800]  jay johnson the head of homeland security is in the news today saying they're not
[11:19.800 --> 11:25.560]  going to criticize isis or radical islam in fact they won't call it radical islam
[11:25.560 --> 11:31.800]  continuing what the white house said but they will put out manuals basically calling veterans
[11:31.800 --> 11:38.280]  terrorist and george washington a bad man i mean i have those articles today we're going to be
[11:38.280 --> 11:45.320]  going over them so won't say isis is bad but conservatives veterans gun owners libertarians
[11:45.320 --> 11:51.880]  christians pro livers uh i mean they're auditing libertarian think tanks they're harassing them
[11:51.880 --> 12:10.760]  and it's it's all over the news that all hades uh is basically breaking loose now there is so much
[12:10.760 --> 12:18.280]  to get to today let me just do this separately mike norris was was laying on me at dinner
[12:18.280 --> 12:25.720]  was actually lunch the most amazing chuck norris stories that no one's ever heard this is his son
[12:26.440 --> 12:31.960]  who he works with in filmmaking and tv and produces his own hit films and tv shows
[12:34.040 --> 12:41.400]  lives in dalis outside dalis my hometown i mean amazing stuff and we're not about gossip or
[12:42.280 --> 12:47.160]  you know entertainment news but we are about celebrating patriots people that are under attack
[12:47.160 --> 12:53.160]  and definitely chuck norris is the real deal not just a character tough guy and a lot of really uh
[12:53.800 --> 12:59.400]  you know enjoyable 70s and 80s and 90s movies and tv shows into the 2000s but the fact that he
[12:59.400 --> 13:03.560]  was the world champion in taekwondo and so many other issues once i was talking to joe rogan
[13:03.560 --> 13:08.440]  who was the national champion and his weight for taekwondo uh but chuck norris was the global
[13:08.440 --> 13:13.960]  champion uh and he of course the host of the ufc and i said would chuck norris do good in
[13:13.960 --> 13:18.600]  ufc today if you know if he was 25 he said absolutely he probably win and he goes because
[13:18.600 --> 13:24.760]  the same stuff he had then is how he would end up winning today and so that's what joe rogan the
[13:24.760 --> 13:31.960]  top commentator on on uh jujitsu martial arts uh you know commentary that's what he had to say
[13:31.960 --> 13:36.040]  about chuck norris so there you know there's a lot of jokes out there the whole chuck norris meme and
[13:36.040 --> 13:39.720]  chuck norris you know is a listener in the broadcast he's been on many times he's received
[13:39.720 --> 13:43.720]  a lot of criticism for coming on the broadcast because they have to act like what i'm saying
[13:43.720 --> 13:49.960]  here is so dirty and so bad they had the fox's five attack saying we're crazy they were even
[13:49.960 --> 13:56.920]  willing to go after ted christ saying why is he listening to alex jones why is the governor
[13:56.920 --> 14:01.880]  listening why is chuck norris listening they're not listening to me i mean they are listening
[14:02.760 --> 14:11.480]  but anyone can go to forbes or ap or the army war college and read where the new main enemy
[14:11.480 --> 14:18.120]  is the patriots we're forcing a national debate about that just like we did about nsa warrant
[14:18.120 --> 14:24.760]  was spying 20 years ago i mean we had the former director of the technical division that's like
[14:24.760 --> 14:30.200]  number three position number four position the equivalent of a two star general william benny
[14:30.200 --> 14:46.120]  in the studio here do you understand that we had james bamford the former main producer of nightline
[14:47.400 --> 14:49.880]  on the broadcast
[14:53.720 --> 14:57.800]  18 years ago and 15 years ago laying out everything that snowden came out with
[14:57.800 --> 15:01.880]  he just gave the latest names and the latest programs but it's all basically the same thing
[15:02.520 --> 15:08.600]  we don't make stuff up when we're speculating about the nature of the universe or matter we will say
[15:08.600 --> 15:15.960]  we're speculating but 95 percent of the time we're not speculating and that's what upsets the dinosaur
[15:15.960 --> 15:24.200]  media so much is we're covering legitimate news and information here that people can go look up
[15:24.200 --> 15:27.960]  for themselves that's why ted cruise said he was concerned because we can't trust the federal
[15:27.960 --> 15:33.160]  government not that jade helms an imminent takeover but that the devolution of the military
[15:33.160 --> 15:40.520]  into a domestic tyranny is a fact and they think you're too stupid to go research that and find out
[15:42.120 --> 15:45.880]  let me give you the other headlines before i drill into all this because there is just so much here
[15:45.880 --> 15:53.160]  tpp trade deal congress giving away its authority tpp means congress surrendering its global
[15:55.960 --> 16:03.720]  authority to busy bodies republicans move to rescue obama trade that takes over the internet

[25:02.600 --> 25:07.400]  so they've been gracious enough uh to come down from north texas to be here in the capital of
[25:07.400 --> 25:14.600]  socialism in texas uh austin and so mike norris and gary haven coming up uh in the second hour
[25:14.600 --> 25:19.880]  today with a lot of jade helm analysis uh their take on how great uh the governor is i know they
[25:19.880 --> 25:25.000]  both know him and and of course gary really knows him well and they told me a lot of really
[25:25.000 --> 25:28.520]  interesting stuff a few months ago two and a half three months ago when i was up there shooting a
[25:28.520 --> 25:36.360]  movie with him i was honored to be part of that uh so that is all coming up today and he doesn't
[25:36.360 --> 25:39.080]  get sick of talking about it i wouldn't either of my dad was chuck norris i love telling stories
[25:39.080 --> 25:45.640]  about my dad regardless uh you want to hear amazing chuck norris stories that no one has ever heard
[25:45.640 --> 25:49.480]  i mean because i googled some of these after he told me these stories they're not out there
[25:49.480 --> 25:55.080]  a bunch of them so uh this is the stuff that legends are made of and of course the biggest
[25:55.080 --> 26:00.920]  legend around is gotta be chuck norris globally uh chuck norris so we're gonna talk about talk
[26:00.920 --> 26:05.320]  about that some of the films that mike has made and this new film that's coming out and and then
[26:05.320 --> 26:09.960]  when the film actually comes out i guess in the winter or maybe next year i'm not sure the times
[26:09.960 --> 26:15.400]  yet uh we're going to certainly be promoting it here because strangely enough it's a film
[26:15.400 --> 26:25.000]  film sinnering around the invasion of texas basically by a force i mean hope i'm not giving away
[26:25.000 --> 26:30.440]  too much right now hope i'm not gary can i get a thumbs up or a thumbs down should i shut up a
[26:30.440 --> 26:35.880]  thumbs up okay he's doing a thumbs up in there folks i'm allowed to say it he'll talk about the
[26:35.880 --> 26:41.160]  upcoming film some when he comes in so i'm very excited again i don't usually get giddy about
[26:41.160 --> 26:44.600]  hollywood stuff but you know these folks aren't from hollywood they're from texas and you got
[26:44.600 --> 26:49.960]  an entrepreneur who started the fastest growing franchise globally ever curves uh you know billions
[26:49.960 --> 26:54.920]  uh and then of course the entrepreneur sold it uh and all these other businesses and then you've
[26:54.920 --> 27:01.400]  got mike norris who on top of it learned how to ride a motorcycle from steve mcqueen so it just
[27:01.400 --> 27:08.520]  goes on and on and on so true lore that would only normally be released in some type of uh
[27:08.520 --> 27:15.640]  uh some type of floor level revelry uh you will be learning all of that coming up here today anyways
[27:15.640 --> 27:20.040]  the they're really fun guys to hang out with and i tell you gary i put them over there gave me
[27:20.680 --> 27:26.760]  an entire bag of some of the best cigars i've ever had so he's also a bad influence ladies and
[27:26.760 --> 27:34.600]  gentlemen so uh all right i'm gonna stop right there this is a short segment so much good news
[27:34.600 --> 27:39.160]  so many things to talk about we're gonna have antony gucciardi in here for about 10 minutes
[27:39.160 --> 27:43.720]  at the start of the new segment with some very important health news uh monsanto has been
[27:43.720 --> 27:49.720]  downgraded to a risky bad investment uh by a major rating agency as it comes out in major human
[27:49.720 --> 27:55.320]  studies in europe that it is linked directly to cancer gee it is in rats and other rodents like
[27:55.320 --> 27:59.640]  guinea pigs who would have thought weed killer might be bad for you oh my gosh what are these
[27:59.640 --> 28:05.080]  what are these conspiracy theorists can talk about next and then if you expand on that the feds just
[28:05.080 --> 28:12.840]  came out and said lower uh from 1.5 parts per million florida to six or seven parts per million
[28:12.840 --> 28:18.920]  because it is causing bone cancer other problems and they said ban it in pesticides because it bio
[28:18.920 --> 28:25.240]  accumulates and uh so if you think one part per million is bad they've got 300 parts per million
[28:25.240 --> 28:31.160]  in the leading powdered egg brand of fluoride i mean you want an iq reducer you want to get
[28:31.160 --> 28:35.320]  a chemical lobotomy baby this is the way to do it and the only reason i throw that out is good
[28:35.320 --> 28:39.800]  things are happening we're proving fluoride's deadly poison that weed killer is deadly poison
[28:39.800 --> 28:45.400]  gee that's again hard to prove isn't it it's just prima facia uh wow honeybees eat it and die wow
[28:45.400 --> 28:51.080]  might be bad for us gee if that kills bugs do i want to eat it uh by the way chuck norris
[28:51.080 --> 28:57.320]  rotting for world net daily transcending left right paradigm has come out and criticized gmo you see
[28:57.320 --> 29:02.360]  it's happening the people are coming together it isn't about being liberal or conservative it's
[29:02.360 --> 29:08.520]  about being pro-life not wanting to kill babies and now as i mentioned earlier mexico has banned
[29:09.160 --> 29:13.960]  a major vaccine in the country because it's killing people and maiming them we're going to
[29:13.960 --> 29:20.120]  be covering that and it's sad people are being killed but it's good news that at least there
[29:20.120 --> 29:26.600]  and in india and in japan and in idly when the kids wow we gave a thousand kids the shot the
[29:26.600 --> 29:31.240]  bunch of them got sick and some died we might not want to give this again and they had their medical
[29:31.240 --> 29:36.440]  doctors go in and look at what happened to them and lo and behold it caused brain inflammation
[29:37.320 --> 29:41.560]  just exactly what all the medical doctors have been saying here so we're on the march

[30:15.960 --> 30:20.200]  by the dean of the faculty of agriculture dr vasquez and his team conducted a survey that
[30:20.200 --> 30:24.600]  found that the incidence of cancer in monta maize was three times the provincial and national
[30:24.600 --> 30:29.480]  average correlating with the exposure to pesticides in the area the main crops grown there are gm
[30:29.480 --> 30:35.160]  soy and maize in september 2012 the journal of food and chemical toxicity published a study showing
[30:35.160 --> 30:40.760]  rats with insanely large cancerous tumors that were fed monsanto's in k603 round of persistent
[30:40.760 --> 30:45.160]  genetically modified corn it looks as if the scientists not under monsanto's thumb are now

[33:38.360 --> 33:41.000]  i guess we can get a billionaire in the building and always got cigars going
[33:41.640 --> 33:45.240]  so now we're having a serious conspiracy here i'm turning into russian limbaugh
[33:45.240 --> 33:49.160]  literally now i'm gonna cover my hair back more and more as it falls out
[33:50.440 --> 33:54.360]  and i had some news article up there was a picture of russian limbaugh it was some story
[33:54.360 --> 34:01.960]  last week where limbaugh uh was uh rightfully saying you know something if you are going to
[34:02.840 --> 34:07.960]  ban free speech because isis might attack conservatives for their speech then you need
[34:07.960 --> 34:12.120]  to ban all the liberals promoting gay gay gay gay gay gay that makes isis mad too
[34:12.120 --> 34:17.320]  too and so i had up russian limbaugh dot com was reading that article and my son goes
[34:17.320 --> 34:22.520]  you look like russian limbaugh i guess with my hair comb back and i'm up against him in the
[34:22.520 --> 34:29.000]  10 same time slot not by design this is where i was put 18 years ago by the network but i am
[34:29.000 --> 34:34.760]  now officially degenerating into it because now i'm smoking cigars on the radio they were back
[34:34.760 --> 34:41.240]  there in my office firing up and uh so i thought you know what we're talking health news why not
[34:41.240 --> 34:46.680]  fire up a stogie because that's what it's all about here at info wars dot com seriously
[34:48.200 --> 34:51.000]  i just wanted to violate the city of austin ordinance against indoor smoking
[34:52.040 --> 34:55.880]  anthony do you wish to lodge a complaint against me for this you know i think you're a bad person
[34:56.440 --> 35:00.280]  and i think it's bad for you to highlight the fact that we can actually have fun
[35:00.280 --> 35:05.640]  and smoke cigars while still being healthy and still fighting for things like monsanto losing
[35:05.640 --> 35:10.520]  their credit score now to negative losing money every single month we're celebrating that yeah
[35:10.520 --> 35:16.040]  exactly we're celebrating chuck norris we are we're celebrating the american spirit right now
[35:18.120 --> 35:22.440]  it was excuse me please continue well i think it's amazing to think about all the victories we've
[35:22.440 --> 35:27.320]  had and you were talking about monsanto being downgraded by one of the moody's one of the
[35:27.320 --> 35:31.640]  largest investor credit agencies and it goes beyond that because of all the junk we're getting out
[35:31.640 --> 35:37.880]  of the food supply and i think it's worthy of a cigar i think it's a victory cigar especially
[35:37.880 --> 35:44.040]  uh when you're on air and i think what it is it's a talk radio syndrome is what you're experiencing
[35:44.040 --> 35:49.480]  slowly instead of looking like rush limbaugh you're i've only been doing this i want to do this 20
[35:49.480 --> 35:54.920]  years though only starting to experience rush limbaugh syndrome maybe it's just starting to hit
[35:54.920 --> 35:59.400]  you now starting to catch up to you you know i thought i need to take golf back up i haven't
[35:59.400 --> 36:05.800]  played since i was in high school but only because i'm gonna go insane if i don't do something fun
[36:05.800 --> 36:10.440]  no i've been going skeet shooting what's that called clay shooting where it's like a golf course
[36:10.440 --> 36:14.600]  and they and they move them around each week and i think it's like hill country skeet man
[36:14.600 --> 36:19.640]  that place is awesome bro we gotta go up there should well i think you know when you tell people
[36:19.640 --> 36:24.040]  people laugh i've heard people laugh and you say you know i work 16 18 hours a day and they're like
[36:24.040 --> 36:29.160]  oh yeah right it's actually true i've seen you do it well i used to i just you know i just i gotta
[36:29.160 --> 36:34.600]  be honest that the news has gotten so heavy stuff is so hardcore that if i don't have some brevity
[36:34.600 --> 36:39.880]  and have a good time i'm gonna go nuts i've already gone insane but it's hard to exit out of it
[36:39.880 --> 36:43.880]  because of how much it's infiltrated our daily lives i mean you can't even sit down and turn on
[36:44.840 --> 36:48.760]  netflix or something without being hit by all of it look at that it's a picture of you right there
[36:51.640 --> 36:59.000]  ridiculous oh boy that's not really a good thing except he's lost so much weight looks pretty good
[36:59.000 --> 37:02.680]  he has lost a lot of weight he looks younger he looks 20 years younger than he used to
[37:02.680 --> 37:07.640]  you know all right and today i want to get serious because there's so much hardcore news
[37:07.640 --> 37:13.560]  let's go back to this monsanto news and tie it into tpp we know that this basically bans people
[37:13.560 --> 37:19.240]  even labeling globally that's coming out uh it restricts free speech uh the republican leadership
[37:19.240 --> 37:24.520]  is helping obama get it through against the tea party and against liberals who again should be
[37:24.520 --> 37:29.560]  working together against this in r uh that's the headline on drudgerport.com republicans move
[37:29.560 --> 37:35.560]  to rescue obama trade by the way i'm not a huge cigar guy because they're usually not that good
[37:36.360 --> 37:41.160]  this is the one of the most exclusive cigars you can get so exclusive it's private labeled
[37:41.160 --> 37:49.080]  and i can't even say where it came from i think we can take a guess yank again i think so but ultimately
[37:49.080 --> 37:55.400]  i mean look at the tpp what the republicans are standing for this and some of the democrats too
[37:55.400 --> 38:01.640]  it's an ultimate attack on all of us just because vermont is passing mandatory gmo labeling they're
[38:01.640 --> 38:06.360]  freaking out because they know that they're backed by the biotech giants monsanto's losing
[38:06.360 --> 38:11.480]  money and failing and trying to swallow up singenta which is another biotech company because of that
[38:11.480 --> 38:15.400]  moody's and other investors know that they're failing and they're downgrading them so they're
[38:15.400 --> 38:19.640]  losing over and over again tpp is their attack on us because they can't sustain themselves
[38:20.200 --> 38:24.200]  it's ultimately them saying okay we lose now we're going to pass legislation that just bans
[38:24.200 --> 38:28.920]  the mo labeling completely you'll never actually get what you want because we can't do it legally
[38:28.920 --> 38:33.720]  we can't do it rightfully so it's really another victory i mean we what do you make of mexico
[38:33.720 --> 38:36.360]  and i'm going to read this article now it's all i wanted to get you in here today because you've
[38:36.360 --> 38:41.880]  been writing some of these articles in full wars dot com this one is adan salazar wrote this story
[38:41.880 --> 38:48.040]  but he links through to the main uh mexican state-run media systems uh health officials in mexico
[38:48.040 --> 38:52.440]  moved to suspend infant vaccines over the weekend following reports that routine inoculations killed
[38:52.440 --> 38:58.840]  two babies left 29 others suffering terrible adverse effects on friday infants in the uh
[38:59.560 --> 39:06.200]  destitute village of sima javel ciapas uh began experiencing serious side effects resulting
[39:06.200 --> 39:11.400]  from administration of tuberculosis uh and hepatitis v vaccines symptoms reportedly included
[39:11.400 --> 39:17.640]  fever drowsiness seizures and intense headaches g exactly what happens here six of the 29 infants
[39:17.640 --> 39:22.760]  sickened are said to be in critical condition that's one village see imagine it's all over the
[39:22.760 --> 39:29.160]  country it's always much worse cnn mexico reports the parents of two children who died were so upset
[39:29.160 --> 39:33.240]  they did not grant the state permission to conduct autopsies the two families bury their
[39:33.240 --> 39:39.240]  children sunday in coffins provided by the state authorities mexican officials health authorities
[39:39.240 --> 39:42.760]  have now announced their findings of their investigation but say they've been able to
[39:42.760 --> 39:48.040]  identify the uh suspected batch of vaccine and are looking into whether contaminated needles
[39:48.040 --> 39:57.640]  may have played a role oh the no oh no no no no you get stung by a bee maybe one out of a
[39:57.640 --> 40:03.240]  couple hundred people if you don't have an epi pen you die and the same thing happens your
[40:03.240 --> 40:11.160]  brain swells your throat swells different vaccines do different stuff they gave uh smallpox shots
[40:11.160 --> 40:17.000]  at the start of the iraq war to the troops and to the media and out of a press corps several hundred
[40:17.720 --> 40:22.440]  that were embedded was it four or five died some of them only 30 something years old remember
[40:22.440 --> 40:27.880]  that from heart attacks because it caused an autoimmune response in the ventricles i'm no doctor
[40:27.880 --> 40:35.480]  i'm going off what they said in the news the the the experimental uh anthrax shots in 2001
[40:35.480 --> 40:41.320]  and then again in 2004 they tried it it was the military's own doctors actually they called it
[40:41.320 --> 40:45.800]  mutiny they were court marshaling and refusing to give it they finally won because congress went
[40:45.800 --> 40:50.360]  wait a minute this is an experimental vaccine you can't even make troops take that you can make
[40:50.360 --> 40:55.880]  troops take an approved vaccine you cannot make them under federal law they have rights take that
[40:55.880 --> 41:01.000]  so they reinstated all these doctors at first started the mutiny in denver at the air force base
[41:01.000 --> 41:07.320]  so they were like people are dying you can pull that up in the denver post from the time so all
[41:07.320 --> 41:14.440]  we're doing is exposing what's admitted and as a response were demonized just like we have
[41:14.440 --> 41:18.920]  hundreds of mainstream news articles where they're going isn't it good the military's preparing and
[41:18.920 --> 41:23.240]  being trained to take on the patriots and the veterans and then where did we learn about it
[41:23.240 --> 41:28.440]  from the military who's upset they spent it and go alex doesn't like our military he claims their
[41:28.440 --> 41:33.240]  training for a takeover next week no i didn't i said they're training for an incremental takeover
[41:34.120 --> 41:37.960]  and so they're all over the news globally financial times of london london guardian
[41:37.960 --> 41:45.000]  der spiegel new york times why does chuck norris the icon he thought he loved the military now he
[41:45.000 --> 41:50.120]  says that the military is you know planning a texas takeover the summer no he didn't say that he
[41:50.120 --> 41:55.240]  wrote an editorial and said this is part of a process and he supports the military but doesn't
[41:55.240 --> 42:01.480]  trust the executive branch as president eisenhower said only thing wrong maybe i missed it but chuck
[42:01.480 --> 42:08.040]  norris's article is he didn't have he's got a couple presidents quoted in there thomas jefferson
[42:08.040 --> 42:13.560]  and people but we need to get that quote in the councils of government we must guard against the
[42:13.560 --> 42:21.480]  undue influence of the military industrial complex whether sought or unsought but in fact let's pull
[42:21.480 --> 42:29.000]  that quote up we can actually pull the video up am i bad for quoting him the views attack this the
[42:29.000 --> 42:35.640]  fives attack this cbs news abc news this week all of them all of them all of them that i know of
[42:35.640 --> 42:40.840]  are attacking misrepresenting they put me on tv with a tinfoil out of my head and say jones says
[42:40.840 --> 42:45.480]  there's an imminent takeover and that the military is going to put us in walmarts i never said that
[42:45.480 --> 42:51.800]  other people wondered why walmarts are being shut down we said it's a labor dispute that later came
[42:51.800 --> 42:57.640]  out we debunked the walmart story but does it matter to them anthony no a four-year-old could
[42:57.640 --> 43:01.560]  listen to your show and understand that's not what you're saying it's cherry picking that's why all
[43:01.560 --> 43:06.520]  those attack websites all they do is take little quotes and it's so easy because you can read it
[43:06.520 --> 43:09.960]  and you can go read the comments and most people understand all they're doing is cherry picking
[43:09.960 --> 43:14.600]  your quotes and attacking you and using still photos of you from a five-hour show picking the
[43:14.600 --> 43:19.720]  worst still photo from the five hours when you make a funny face it's a joke and it reminds me
[43:19.720 --> 43:25.560]  going back to the vaccine issue most other countries aren't run by an establishment system that's
[43:25.560 --> 43:29.640]  either medical or military or bureaucratic or whatever to the point where they can't even say
[43:29.640 --> 43:33.800]  or do anything that's why mexico is actually taking action against it because you're allowed to
[43:33.800 --> 43:38.440]  actually question things like why are there additives in the vaccinations like hormones
[43:38.440 --> 43:45.080]  and i'll say that i was down in mexico sport fishing and elima harris and i i think my family's
[43:45.080 --> 43:50.920]  like what's we ran into more fans there than we do in the us i mean the mexicans were awake man
[43:50.920 --> 43:54.120]  mexicans that didn't really speak english alex jones we you know we love you we want and then i'd be
[43:54.120 --> 43:59.400]  like hotel managers were listeners and then we'd go rent a boat maybe listeners and and it was just
[43:59.400 --> 44:04.680]  like crazy how awake the mexicans are and in germany too you go over there and you have cancer
[44:04.680 --> 44:08.600]  they don't say okay we're going to radiate you and give you chemo they're going to say hey well
[44:08.600 --> 44:13.000]  let's look into some ozone therapy let's look into some turmeric let's look into some iodine
[44:13.000 --> 44:16.680]  they're going to say things like that they're not going to immediately start radiating you and insult
[44:16.680 --> 44:20.600]  you if you question it i want to get to some major health news and some major info wars news but
[44:20.600 --> 44:23.880]  first we do have the eisenhower quote and can you guys pull up the video of that too when you
[44:23.880 --> 44:28.360]  get a chance i want to just start playing it obnoxiously because i was going to quote this on
[44:28.360 --> 44:33.000]  this week oh by the way there it is in the councils of government we must guard against the
[44:33.000 --> 44:37.320]  acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial
[44:37.320 --> 44:43.400]  complex the potential for disastrous rise of misplaced power to exist and will persist and he
[44:43.400 --> 44:51.560]  went on to say the military industrial complex run by a technocratic and cultural elite the eugenicist
[44:51.560 --> 44:57.960]  the transhumanist they were in control then he was getting briefed on the plan and he watched
[44:57.960 --> 45:04.680]  that whole speech 21 minutes he's nervous and i'm not going to go any further but some of his family
[45:05.320 --> 45:11.320]  some of his daughters and granddaughters that married the lbj's they live in town and they
[45:11.320 --> 45:14.760]  know about this stuff and i'm not saying they're a perfect family they're involving a lot of you
[45:14.760 --> 45:19.160]  know hell they own like two or three big high-rise buildings downtown you know the point is is that
[45:19.160 --> 45:23.960]  they know what's going on i mean anyone who's been inside the system knows this is the agenda
[45:23.960 --> 45:29.880]  now shifting gears i didn't plug anything yesterday in three hours because i got so upset about the
[45:29.880 --> 45:34.280]  news i i skipped through i think three network breaks that cost us thousands of dollars each
[45:34.280 --> 45:39.400]  time i do that and i start running low on fuel because this operation is like a bomber we've
[45:39.400 --> 45:45.080]  got the weapons the truth we've got the initiative we know who the globalist are but we need the
[45:45.080 --> 45:50.280]  funding that's the fuel and i call this midair refueling we have how many products now in info
[45:50.280 --> 45:54.840]  warslife.com is that a very exciting announcement how many products anthony i don't know the count
[45:54.840 --> 46:03.240]  numerous i mean it's got to be like i think it's like 15 i think it's 15 14 or 15 new proprietary
[46:03.240 --> 46:08.360]  products some of them are just from the biggest labs that are the most trusted in the country
[46:08.360 --> 46:13.080]  that we private label but we soup them up we say well could you add this or could you increase the
[46:13.080 --> 46:17.080]  dosage of that they're like absolutely we're glad people want to buy this stuff from us and make
[46:17.080 --> 46:21.480]  it even better but we go to the best we in fact we have a lot of the studies and stuff on the
[46:21.480 --> 46:25.080]  site we're going to add more on what was added today uh where they keep coming back going there's
[46:25.080 --> 46:29.320]  nothing this is beyond california standards how is this happening from some of the biggest tell
[46:29.320 --> 46:34.440]  folks our labs we use not the labs manufacturer but the labs to test it right we'll use nf nsf
[46:34.440 --> 46:39.320]  certified which is above and beyond gmp we also use gmp certified labs but what happens over and
[46:39.320 --> 46:43.560]  over again is we get these tested for the metals make sure they're super clean and every single time
[46:43.560 --> 46:49.160]  even i can't believe it's just zero zero zero yeah but we're already we've already tested it i mean
[46:49.160 --> 46:53.240]  these companies have already done it they're the highest rated we do it again no absolutely but i
[46:53.240 --> 46:57.480]  know we have some of them i want to go in and actually put those on remember we talked about this
[46:57.480 --> 47:01.080]  few weeks ago i want to go add those today can we do that yeah and we published the item once
[47:01.080 --> 47:05.000]  about a year ago and people were super like super shocked i don't know but i want to add the new
[47:05.000 --> 47:10.760]  ones yeah absolutely the what was it the vitamin d3 and the vitamin 12 we have tests on everything
[47:10.760 --> 47:16.200]  we do independent lab tests after the nsf certified labs test it which we don't even have to do that
[47:16.200 --> 47:21.400]  but we do anyway just a double triple quadruple because we know we're targets yep exactly in case
[47:21.400 --> 47:25.720]  they come after us and say hey you didn't you know you don't have to test we have five tests we don't
[47:25.720 --> 47:30.120]  just have one we have five yeah we have from the biggest labs in the country making it but also
[47:30.120 --> 47:37.240]  testing it separately so we're launching a new product i've been 41 now about to be 42 and everybody
[47:37.240 --> 47:45.400]  knows you hit 40 it's it's it's mainline recommended that you take sawpaw metal and things like that
[47:45.400 --> 47:50.120]  this has got 10 ingredients but you can look into what selenium does what copper does these are the
[47:50.120 --> 47:56.680]  pure types because they've got a lot of dirty ones out there vitamin d3 zinc the the the key
[47:56.680 --> 48:04.440]  plant sterols and and other ingredients oil of oregano is one of the products but now we have
[48:04.440 --> 48:10.520]  prostagard that has come out and you hear people say oh we've got this it's free just pay $10
[48:10.520 --> 48:17.160]  shipping and handling folks that's just sawpaw metal and it's not that strong and i'm not
[48:17.160 --> 48:27.320]  gonna put this out this is a Rolls Royce private labeled it's as high with other sellers this is
[48:27.320 --> 48:35.000]  our proprietary blend of $29.95 this is $19.95 we have a limited first run of this prostagard i've
[48:35.000 --> 48:40.440]  been taking a leading competitor for the last two years my you talked to my doctor about it it really
[48:40.440 --> 48:45.960]  does in not just help you everybody knows it improves everything and that one was $40 that
[48:45.960 --> 48:51.880]  was $40 this one is $19.95 and this is our own blend can i get this anywhere else this is exclusively
[48:51.880 --> 49:00.040]  formulated by the nsf lab for us this is our own infowars life formula it is ultra ultra reduced price
[49:00.040 --> 49:05.000]  and it has sawpaw metal lycopene and by the way sawpaw metal is great i'm going to read to you
[49:05.000 --> 49:10.920]  something from the mayo clinic about sawpaw metal which i was surprised to read today but lycopene
[49:10.920 --> 49:16.120]  is considered the new sawpaw metal and when i talked to those uh the scientists at the lab i
[49:16.120 --> 49:20.280]  guess it was about a year ago they said yeah sawpaw metal is awesome and you should be taking that
[49:20.280 --> 49:24.920]  and most formulas are just a high dose of that and they charge you $40 but you really need to look
[49:24.920 --> 49:30.440]  into lycopene and i did and i talked to a few doctors about it this is the new sawpaw metal
[49:31.000 --> 49:36.120]  and then we have vitamin d3 thrown in there selenium copper zinc the total of 10 different
[49:36.120 --> 49:40.360]  ingredients now they all work together in synergy they all work together in synergy they're hand
[49:40.360 --> 49:44.600]  picked they're formulated in such a way that they're not going to compete with each other
[49:44.600 --> 49:50.600]  and what's interesting to me is that traditionally all the way back to the american indians they were
[49:50.600 --> 49:54.200]  using a number of these ingredients saying that for some reasons as they just knew that when they
[49:54.200 --> 49:59.080]  took it the reproductive health was better they just knew that oh you need to take these berries
[49:59.080 --> 50:03.400]  and that's what we took the sawpaw metal from we took it from berries it's a berry form of sawpaw
[50:03.400 --> 50:09.720]  metal which is arguably uh one of the best kinds so the american Indians were using this for countless
[50:09.720 --> 50:13.960]  years the mayans were using this they called it their health tonic they called it their uh
[50:13.960 --> 50:19.880]  reproductive tonic bottom line everybody knows about sawpaw metal we just add all these other
[50:19.880 --> 50:25.400]  ingredients a super charge it's organic it's concentrated and it supports a hardcore operation

[55:01.240 --> 55:06.200]  but i also believe a lot of gun owners would agree that ak-47s belong in the hands of soldiers not
[55:06.200 --> 55:09.960]  the hands of criminals
[55:15.080 --> 55:19.560]  for many of the police and guard troops it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an american

[56:14.280 --> 56:19.640]  out a context where we're wargaming the whole thing talking about it and i'm like this looks
[56:19.640 --> 56:25.400]  like an invasion plan calling us hostile oh my god he says they're invading what do you think all
[56:25.400 --> 56:30.760]  this is it's a soft invasion to condition the military to accept it i'm going to play next hour

[57:20.120 --> 57:25.080]  by the government recommended uh many studies it makes me actually question it now i'm joking
[57:25.080 --> 57:29.400]  many studies report that saw palmetto may be as effective as the hormonal agent
[57:29.400 --> 57:37.160]  fister tried or pros pro car and may cause fewer side effects just goes on for page after page

[01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:36.520]  so
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:52.840]  child protective services the name says it all cps claims that they are out to protect children
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:58.040]  from abusive and neglectful parents but is that just a ruse in order to take healthy children away
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:02.600]  from good families to place them in the foster care system where they receive bounties from
[01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:06.840]  the federal government that's right the average reimbursement to state and local government for
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:12.520]  each child taken into foster care is about six thousand dollars a month the foster care provider
[01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:17.240]  receives about six hundred dollars a month of that therefore each one of these kids forced into
[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:23.320]  foster care are worth approximately five thousand dollars to cps two foster parents had criminal
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:29.160]  records a son living there with multiple felonies and a convicted sex offender visiting and sometimes
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:36.040]  caring for the children she refused to arrange an adoption her cps supervisors responded with this
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:42.920]  memo recommending the adoption should proceed quickly our theory is that the basis for this
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:49.240]  is the tie to the federal money that every time a child is not placed in a home the state of
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:54.440]  kentucky through its cabinet is losing federal money health protective services in pennsylvania
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:02:00.360]  was at her doorstep taking her one day old baby because they thought liz was abusing drugs but
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:09.720]  what the hospital didn't consider more closely was poppy seeds we reached out to cps they say they
[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:14.840]  can't specifically comment on this case because of privacy law but we wanted to know what the rules
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:20.920]  are and what rights parents have cps says we conduct a risk assessment of the child's safety and
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:26.600]  rely heavily on the direction of health care providers and now anna and alex find themselves
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:32.520]  fighting for sammy's return and for their rights as parents where there's children there are pedophiles
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:38.440]  you know they're in schools and they're in churches and they're everywhere where they can
[01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:43.800]  get their hands on children so we know that that's true and it's it's got to be brought to an end
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:48.840]  it's got to be completely exposed for what it is and in my opinion it needs to completely be
[01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:56.680]  completely be dissolved i i don't see any good left in child protective services senator nancy

[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:22.680]  thorough investigation cps adversary senator nancy schaefer and her husband's life met a very
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:27.640]  abrupt end there are far too many oddities surrounding her life for it to have been anything
[01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:33.880]  but an assassination due to her outspoken crusade to uncover one of the prime child smuggling areas
[01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:39.320]  in the united states at lana georgia bruce was retired and the couple didn't appear to be in
[01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:44.120]  any type of dire financial crisis friends who knew the couple best state that bruce would
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:49.480]  simply not have had the capability to kill his wife nancy was actively exposing corruption within
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:54.920]  the department of family and child services including actions by the dfcs director in the county
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:59.960]  where she lived nancy's husband bruce was highly supportive of nancy's work for decades and would
[01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:05.720]  have had little or no reason to suddenly try to kill her at such a critical juncture in her career

[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:39.320]  take your two-year-old happy daughter who'd never been in the hospital and never been sick and never
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:45.960]  been beaten up you go for weekly visits all right that's just a few minutes from a special

[01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:28.520]  and they even committed war crimes so what's it gonna take i mean what will it take to finally
[01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:34.840]  wake you up think about it if joseph stallin ran for president as a democrat and adolf hitler

[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:20.840]  been friends for years and of course they are filmmakers entrepreneurs mr gaven of course
[01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:25.880]  started haven haven always said wrong haven you can slap me around all you want i don't have
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:33.240]  teleprompters there no you don't yeah yeah yeah uh mr haven started curves and the reason i'm
[01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:37.800]  my memory must have a friend to think where did you start originally in harlingen texas in harlingen
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:43.320]  texas and now you're you've made a major movie with mr norris over here that i was honored to be in
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:47.320]  that's coming out in the future we're going to talk about that tell us about the film and then
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:56.440]  tell us about yourself and then mike norris over here mr haven all you well i uh i retired sold my
[01:10:56.440 --> 01:11:02.360]  company a couple years ago and was looking for something to do and influencing the culture in
[01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:10.440]  a positive way was something that i felt i had a duty to do and you know people uh don't take the
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:14.600]  time they're busy they don't want to watch the news or really invest in reading about what's
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:19.720]  going on but they'd like to be entertained and if you can entertain people why you teach them
[01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:24.120]  something i just thought was a great idea and mike and i've been friends for a long time mike is a
[01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:30.200]  real famous movie director who's done about 20 different films and and so i came in one day
[01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:35.080]  and said i got a great idea you know let's make some movies together and let's influence the culture
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:39.720]  in a positive way while we entertain people and the first movie we made was uh it's out and it's
[01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:47.800]  available now uh it's called mission air and uh you can go and find that information about that from
[01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:53.640]  pure flicks which was the uh distributor for god's not dead for example go to the website and in
[01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:57.720]  christian bookstores and you can you can get mission and by the way these christian films now
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:02.680]  are bigger than a lot of hollywood films i mean the patch from the crisis an example absolutely
[01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:07.720]  i'm sorry gary um there's a number of films that were released this year with a faith-based message
[01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:13.560]  that have done phenomenal so it's really great to see the culture actually starting to change
[01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:19.160]  and and view this this material that we're putting out so it's very exciting it's voting with your
[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:23.720]  dollars i mean this is how you really change the culture absolutely but but it wasn't until
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:28.920]  about nine months ago that gary had this idea for another film that really kind of ramped everything
[01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:34.360]  up uh to a whole another level and that's our next film in merrigaden now gary haven i should have
[01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:39.560]  gone over your bio a little bit better than and not butchered your name here live on radio uh but
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:43.320]  get to know you've just really been amazing your insight into government all the people you've
[01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:47.880]  been talking to federally at the state level you've learned a lot of amazing stuff and it's wild
[01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:54.360]  to know the plot of your upcoming film that's already been shot is now being edited to see
[01:12:54.360 --> 01:13:00.200]  that then it ties into jade helm and it ties into this very theme that america is so concerned about
[01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:07.720]  yeah merrigaden was an idea that i had i i felt that people needed to learn about power and about
[01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:14.680]  what was going on in the world uh the mainstream media is is owned 98 percent of it by six corporations
[01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:20.280]  uh they're scripted they stay on message and so people are not getting the truth out there
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:26.760]  and and i want to commend you you are a i'll please don't no i tell you the the courage
[01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:33.160]  and also your gift to articulate these difficult concepts things like vaccinations you were talking
[01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:37.720]  about earlier you know people are not going to get the truth from the mainstream media
[01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:42.600]  you know much money the pharmaceutical companies spend on mainstream media and to think that they
[01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:48.520]  don't control the message with all that money would be naive so someone like you can articulate it
[01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:52.760]  beautifully it in a way people can understand you can do it better than i in fact your degree is in
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:56.760]  health why don't you give us your take on vaccines you're just telling me about them earlier well
[01:13:57.320 --> 01:14:04.120]  vaccines are a a very concerning thing and i have a five month old granddaughter you know
[01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:09.560]  in it two months this eight pound child was scheduled to to get this cocktail of vaccines
[01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:17.960]  uh whooping cough among them i uh that's something that it is really concerning what's in these
[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:24.280]  vaccines you know do they have mercury do they have aluminum uh do they have uh the the material
[01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:30.040]  of the tissue the vaccines were grown on from green from rhesus monkeys uh that dna is in these
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:34.920]  vaccines you know i'm not saying don't get vaccines but i'm saying think about it think
[01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:42.360]  critically before you allow the establishment to inject into the vein of your eighth pound child
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:47.880]  a cocktail of vaccines people need to take responsibility for themselves they need to
[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:53.560]  think about it because the system has been monetized and so vaccines is a great example
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:15:00.120]  of of the the need for for americans for people like us to just think critically
[01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:06.760]  let's talk about the new film that's in production when it's coming out as much
[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:14.360]  as you can tell us about it the title well um what we could tell you now is um films called
[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:21.960]  marageddon uh we're looking for a about a november release date um we are in uh post
[01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:28.040]  production right now gosh i wish we had um i wish we had a clip to show me yeah a good clip that might
[01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:32.680]  include one of the stars of the show uh uh you might be sitting here with us here today
[01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:36.840]  do we have a let's see if we've got that clip available wait you guys are surprising i don't
[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:42.840]  even know this is to grade that we don't know what you're up to stockpiling food weapons fuel the
[01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:47.800]  national defense authorization act is there to stop domestic terrorist threats to this country
[01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:58.840]  and people like you i am an american i am a patriot you sir are nothing but a traitor
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:08.840]  that man's threat to this country
[01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:15.320]  that little rant will be all over the news tonight
[01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:22.920]  you must understand this plays into our hands the american news media has our narrative and
[01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:29.960]  that narrative charlie gray is perfectly playing the role of right wing extremist the stigma of
[01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:35.000]  that label will stop up the years of the american public faster than any propaganda we could fashion
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:44.600]  by the way you guys we didn't plan any of this uh and and and i just can't believe that you guys
[01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:51.400]  snuck that it is so good that looks better than the big giant blockbuster movies i wish i could
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:56.040]  have lighting like that for my show man that looks good thank you and it sounds good yeah uh
[01:16:56.040 --> 01:17:03.480]  you know uh after you guys called and invited us on uh mr haven says get a clip together and i go
[01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:09.160]  yes sir and so uh we we just kind of put that together just to give the audience a little feel
[01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:16.360]  of um you know the bad politicians the bad guy and our hero in the movie well folks if you just
[01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:24.680]  joined us uh we have with us two amazing individuals mike norris and gary haven in studio and the new
[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:29.480]  film is coming out in november and of course it'll be in quite a few theaters it becomes a hit in
[01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:34.920]  theaters it'll then go nationwide in the thousands of screens if something like this and believe me
[01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:39.320]  i've seen the script i've been in the movie gets out the public with this whole climate i mean
[01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:43.880]  could you guys have imagined we'd be talking about jade helm and all this right when your movie's
[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:48.840]  getting ready to come out yeah because for folks that don't know we don't give the plot away yeah
[01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:54.280]  well we'll tell a little bit about the kind of the theme of it you know i saw this coming uh and
[01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:58.520]  felt like we needed to warn people we need to educate them while we entertain them and it was
[01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:03.560]  kind of consistent with our message so we went from the christian movie to the political realm
[01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:10.200]  and uh and by the way uh you play an evil senator who who is debating with me in front of a city
[01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:18.440]  hearing and you were particularly evil well i tell you uh you guys were gonna have somebody else
[01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:22.360]  play the role and i guess you moved to another position about two weeks before you said hey do
[01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:27.320]  you want to do this i said sure and then uh like about four or five days before i get the script
[01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:32.680]  that had been changed uh and i think i did an okay job but not as good as you guys did that's all right
[01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:38.920]  you're you really are good i mean it just the dynamics of the both of you we're all on the same
[01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:44.280]  side here but what's fun is to go into a movie and you get to play a crooked politician well i tell
[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:49.320]  you i actually did about 10 takes that i sort of really not liking gary it was it was weird it was
[01:18:49.320 --> 01:19:00.040]  weird well it was actually 14 takes out i there's a lot of footage wow this is all over we'll pull
[01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:05.000]  out the fun footage and we'll just have a little party together oh my gosh it's amazing listen i want
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:09.560]  to come back from break here in a moment and get back into the film uh but give us a sneak peek
[01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:17.080]  gary how much of this can we get into well the the movie's based kind of the byline is a true story
[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:23.640]  that hasn't happened yet and and we're really seeing that play out right now uh one of the
[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:30.360]  scenes for example in fact with you uh was a take from a conversation i had with my congressman
[01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:36.680]  where i challenged him why he voted for the national defense authorization act and and i said to him
[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:41.240]  do you realize it suspends the the fifth hold on you told me this story over dinner it was amazing

[01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:49.880]  film for what you told me because you kept going around warning people and then getting this response

[01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:53.640]  so his politics being a real constitutionalist a big fan of 1776 a big supporter of george
[01:24:53.640 --> 01:25:00.360]  washington reading his columns uh in worldnetdaily.com in the last decade or so however long it's been
[01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:05.880]  have made me really get into the mind of chuck norris and see what a one-of-a-kind guy he is
[01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:11.560]  and then to meet his son who's a listener and a patriot as well and and then to meet gary and just
[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:15.560]  to and then the stories you told me about people in government who are awake people that aren't
[01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:22.920]  you know telling me what a real deal uh governor abbott is uh as well uh but i've talked a lot of
[01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:26.840]  folks that know him that have worked for him before he was even in government they say he's a real
[01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:32.200]  christian man a great guy really cares he's suing the government over the power plant shutdowns he's
[01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:35.800]  fighting to secure our border i think we're really lucky to have him as a governor i'm just giving
[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:39.480]  a prelude this is a short segment to what we're going to be talking about today but listen don't
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:43.880]  pause for me i mean i loved having that two hour dinner with you guys where you were just
[01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:47.800]  just just screaming of consciousness you're the guys that eat a radio show fighting the new
[01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:51.640]  world order but hell you've got movies fighting the new world order let's get back as we come back
[01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:55.240]  from break we're gonna play that clip again i got blindsided by that i want to see that again
[01:25:55.240 --> 01:26:00.120]  tell us about the new film how people support it and and more of the plot because when they hear
[01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:06.040]  the plot and understand this is not a b movie folks i mean you spent big money on this you know
[01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:10.440]  you've got hundreds of millions of dollars you spent a lot of money on this you got an incredible
[01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:14.040]  director and mike i've seen a lot of your films they're powerful because you know my kids mainly
[01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:19.240]  watch christian films and you're one of the top directors but my gosh you've knocked it i mean
[01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:24.600]  what that that looks better than steven spielberg movies when they show congress how did you do that
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:38.120]  right here gary i i you know i i do not take lightly what anything that gary asks of me i um
[01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:43.400]  i have so much respect for gary and his wife diane that when this challenge was brought on to do
[01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:51.800]  this film i was in let's do it but boy i had no idea what i was getting into uh once production
[01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:57.560]  started things were happening left and right and decisions having to be made and for this film to
[01:26:57.560 --> 01:27:05.000]  come out the way it did with the message that it's presenting i agree with gary this is a god thing
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:09.480]  that this is happening to get out to get people to open their eyes to what's really happening
[01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:15.160]  in the world um we need this alternative media and and you were talking about my father well
[01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:21.400]  the first thing you told me tell alex i said hi i'm a huge fan so i'm just really excited about
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:27.160]  america absolutely shifting years we're gonna come back and talk more about america and how
[01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:31.800]  people can support it and and make this international huge hit that it needs to be to really educate
[01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:37.720]  people because we're dominating news media the the the liberty movement is able to counter
[01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:43.640]  cnn msnbc but the real brainwashing as you guys were saying during the break is in the music is
[01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:47.800]  in and hollywood is in the culture that's where they're really getting everybody and the fact that
[01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:54.840]  more and more not just christian but patriot film could become the new mega genre that could
[01:27:54.840 --> 01:28:00.200]  basically unseat this and counter their narrative and people are hungry for it so it's not like we're
[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:05.720]  pushing a boulder uphill we're at the top of a hill about to push it downhill at the globalist in my

[01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:34.200]  that little rant will be all over the news tonight you must understand this place into our hands
[01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:41.720]  the american news media has our narrative and at that narrative charlie gray is perfectly
[01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:47.000]  playing the role of right wing extremist the stigma of that label will stop up the years
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:54.760]  of the american public faster than any propaganda we could fashion and that's a clip from the
[01:33:54.760 --> 01:34:01.640]  upcoming film that is going to be coming on in what november yeah roughly november wow
[01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:07.080]  yeah and and is there a website for it yet no no we're right now everything is about getting
[01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:14.200]  the film done we're in vfx right now um first cut's pretty much done um but we just want to give
[01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:19.800]  you a little taste of you well it looks really good i remember seeing the monitors and how
[01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:24.040]  because i've been in some other pretty big films we're like keanu reeves and other folks
[01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:28.840]  some link letter films too of them and quite a few other little movies uh i never really
[01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:32.440]  sought it out but people say hey will you do this cameo or you come do this because pretty much
[01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:36.360]  just playing myself the reason i like this was it was doing something different that's fun
[01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:41.960]  exactly exactly and and that was you had it good though you're just playing yourself it was it's
[01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:47.640]  kind of easy being angry at the system uh in in how they're they're they're uh threatening our freedom
[01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:51.560]  is is a pretty thing to get and again this is gary haven't we've got mike norris here
[01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:56.840]  i tell you i mean your dad's been on the show before via phone and then he came out once
[01:34:56.840 --> 01:35:00.920]  when we were trying to stop the standoff in east texas and he helped kind of diffuse that with the
[01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:05.320]  graze uh so i i mean i know your dad and then i was i mean i knew he was a listener even 15 years
[01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:09.080]  ago but when he's been on he goes no i really am a you know routine listener so i'm just so
[01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:13.400]  flattered but it's how many other people are aware and it's not like i taught tuc norris anything
[01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:18.520]  he was already a patriot before i was born but what do you make with jade helm because i don't
[01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:23.080]  want to give away the film but it it almost parallels this what do you make of jade helm
[01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:29.960]  and and and senator cruise and uh representative golmer and governor abbott and all these other
[01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:35.880]  prominent people saying no and chuck norris no we don't trust obama we don't think this is a takeover
[01:35:35.880 --> 01:35:41.240]  but there shouldn't be this major domestic role we know the military is in the news training to
[01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:48.280]  take on the patriots gary yeah this really is an area i've spent a lot of time it you know being
[01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:55.480]  retired uh it gives me about six hours a day to read and to to stay up on things and so i've i've
[01:35:55.480 --> 01:36:01.320]  i've enjoyed getting to know that now my company does business in 90 countries so i've got a neat
[01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:08.360]  world view of events ukraine for example uh uh if you follow the the script the mainstream media has
[01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:14.280]  been promoting on ukraine uh you would think that putin's this bad guy who's come into chroma and
[01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:21.320]  and taking it over this script is just all wrong uh the united states uh spent six billion dollars
[01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:27.480]  through the state department victoria newland to to overthrow the elected government of ukraine
[01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:34.120]  and this is all about uh moneyed interest it's about bankers interest uh it's another war
[01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:41.320]  where we're going to send our kids in our treasure to go protect the the the assets of monsanto and
[01:36:41.320 --> 01:36:47.320]  in the oil companies and the central bankers and i was having this discussion at dinner
[01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:54.360]  with the governor and ted cruz senator ted cruz uh a few weeks ago and and i was actually vetting
[01:36:54.360 --> 01:36:59.080]  ted cruz you know i was really hopeful we've got a guy that's going to stand up to these moneyed
[01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:04.840]  interests that are controlling our government and um and i was really hopeful that that he was on our
[01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:11.720]  side now i knew that ted cruz's wife was a vice president for uh uh uh for golden sacks and uh
[01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:16.680]  gulma sacks and also that she's a member of the council for our relations and you know it puts him
[01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:23.320]  under suspicion but we had a it wasn't a discussion in fact i'll tell you how it went uh he kind of
[01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:27.640]  talked to the six or eight people at the table about why we need to be there why we need to send
[01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:32.200]  our kids there and i kept my mouth shut and when it was my turn to speak i i started the
[01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:36.920]  conversation like this i said senator uh i know you're a harvard law school graduate who's argued
[01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:43.880]  in front of the spring court i may regret what i'm about to say and i gave the true view of the
[01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:50.200]  ukraine uh over about 10 minutes uh in fact it was so heated i turned to the governor and i said uh
[01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:57.160]  are you gonna invite me back and uh and he did and i think he got to hear the truth uh in in front
[01:37:57.160 --> 01:38:02.520]  of the two of us challenging each other and and i i gotta tell you i wanted to debate with ted cruz
[01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:08.680]  because i had the truth on my side and i was fully informed um that's the one thing i don't like
[01:38:08.680 --> 01:38:13.080]  about him is that he is supporting starting a war with the russians it doesn't mean putin is a good
[01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:18.680]  guy it's just that you don't overthrow an elected government and put neo nazis in charge so joe
[01:38:18.680 --> 01:38:27.080]  biden's son can run a gas company exactly uh this thing stinks so bad that that it and it's a great
[01:38:27.080 --> 01:38:33.560]  example of the control the mainstream media uh uh has on on the informations out there and on who
[01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:38.600]  controls the mainstream media and the american people again it goes back to critical thinking
[01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:43.800]  we really need to quit when you can't just think these people are stupid you know going in poking
[01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:50.440]  a stick in a nuclear power russia uh is just not a good idea and and yet they're doing it in syria
[01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:55.160]  they're doing it in iran they're doing it in in in the ukraine and and you always ask the question
[01:38:55.160 --> 01:39:00.840]  kuo bono who's benefiting from this if you ask that question you can get to the bottom of a lot
[01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:05.240]  of things that's right and these aren't generals these are bankers that think they're invincible
[01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:11.800]  and insulated because they got 15 helicopters no a nuclear war breaks out it's over it's it's insane
[01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:17.160]  and and this all comes from the wulfowitz doctrine uh which came out in the 90s from paul wulfowitz the
[01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:22.840]  secretary of defense when he said that we have to maintain hegemon we have to be the most powerful
[01:39:22.840 --> 01:39:28.600]  the only powerful country on the planet and if any other countries begin to to threaten our power
[01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:35.080]  we have to annihilate them and i'll tell you what we don't have uh the the means we should not be
[01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:43.240]  trying to to dominate the world uh in in it enforce you know our views on on the world
[01:39:43.240 --> 01:39:49.240]  we're going to well i mean we're not even putting american views we're like trying to make russia
[01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:55.720]  teach five-year-olds about gay marriage yeah i mean pootons like saying you're not christian
[01:39:55.720 --> 01:40:00.360]  we're being lectured by latin america who like is trying to put christianity back in schools we've
[01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:05.000]  taken it out i mean this is really getting upside down it's crazy and again you know
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:12.120]  the the this is happening in such a large scale that that our voices uh are are these quiet cries
[01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:17.320]  in the night but but truth is a powerful thing we have truth on our side and we have to have the
[01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:24.040]  courage to speak it i believe i was given the ability the opportunity to speak truth to power
[01:40:24.040 --> 01:40:29.320]  whether it's senator chic cruise or whether it's governor i spent nine hours with george w bush
[01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:34.440]  this is gary haven speaking the founder of the curves uh one of the most successful the most
[01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:39.400]  successful according to forward's franchise in history made billions of dollars and he's here
[01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:43.400]  now trying to fight the global let's go ahead yeah you know and i think you were meeting with george
[01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:49.640]  bush i took him to haiti in my aircraft uh four hours there four hours back uh just him and i
[01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:55.560]  sitting talking so i've had the opportunity to to really speak truth to power on so many different
[01:40:55.560 --> 01:41:02.360]  levels i was a major republican donor because i thought that by supporting conservative republicans
[01:41:02.360 --> 01:41:09.000]  that i could influence good government well i've given up on that uh the republican party has given
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:14.120]  themselves over uh to to the through the establishment well look how they're pushing the tpp
[01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:19.800]  right now that they want to let congress see they're helping obama beat the republicans it's
[01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:25.320]  incredible that's a great example and again this is where you and i uh have a responsibility
[01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:32.440]  you know this trans-specific partnership uh is is not available to to the general public
[01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:39.960]  speaking kept secret this is insane and in this we think from leaks that corporations are going
[01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:45.320]  to be given power to sue governments and and and uh when governments interfere with their
[01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:52.280]  profitability well and we're not allowed to to see this a witnesses the american people should be
[01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:58.920]  up in arms over the the the audacity of of our government and i tell you the republicans are
[01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:07.080]  pushing this as hard as obama is a a a set of laws is going to totally change our society we're not
[01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:14.200]  even allowed to look at it where is the outrage uh over our loss of freedoms over this this issue
[01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:20.920]  it's it's the the whole thing right now is crazy but then this jade helm in our movie is uh uh
[01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:27.480]  uh predict it talks about things like the national defense authorization act uh which the republican
[01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:32.840]  party uh supported that gives the president the ability to declare martial law for any reason
[01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:38.840]  economic or otherwise without approval of congress and under martial law that's right those executive
[01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:44.120]  orders and pdds are all in the books it's been in the news you can just search obama signs executive
[01:42:44.120 --> 01:42:48.680]  order to take over entire economy and during any emergency including economic they put internet
[01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:54.200]  kill switches in they've got india it's all there they say they're main enemies christians and veterans
[01:42:54.200 --> 01:42:59.000]  and gun owners i mean this is crazy and chuck norris reads it and louis gomert reads it and
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:04.600]  senator cruz reads it and ron paul reads it and you read it and we're it's not i mean we're just
[01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:11.880]  telling people they're building this huge tyrannical program and then they misrepresent what we all say
[01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:19.800]  well our movie was a chance to to provide an entertaining venue where we demonstrate and
[01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:28.040]  educate uh what uh 13603 executive order actually does where the president can take
[01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:33.960]  all of your resources i'm a former rancher they can come and take my tractors they can come and
[01:43:33.960 --> 01:43:41.560]  take my property my land they can come and take me and enforce me to work without wages and if
[01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:47.320]  you read 13603 it's very very clear well we talk about this in the movie and then we demonstrate it
[01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:54.120]  we show how the un is going to side uh with the american army and and come in and and arrest
[01:43:54.120 --> 01:43:58.440]  dissidents and by the way that's as you know been in the washington post that they're going to use
[01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:04.120]  un troops during civil disturbance in america yeah it's all out there i mean we read we you're
[01:44:04.120 --> 01:44:08.760]  a you know billionaire company guy you know smart guys founded companies you've made all these top
[01:44:08.760 --> 01:44:13.480]  films i've built my own media system it's not like we're total idiots and we just make stuff up
[01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:19.000]  i mean it's all right here i mean this is what's going on and the thing is it's not like we're
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:24.520]  being conquered uh by the romans or something they're going to put aqueducts in uh we're being
[01:44:24.520 --> 01:44:30.520]  conquered unless the romans were good by the globalists that are anti-human malthusian
[01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:36.920]  exterminist basically satanist and so that's the real problem is we're being conquered by some
[01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:43.960]  really nasty people you know there's three things that that people ought to uh get a hold of uh the
[01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:51.560]  first thing is is that uh that the power in washington uh has been bought and paid for by
[01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:57.560]  moneyed interest there there there is no representation of the people and i could prove this princeton
[01:44:57.560 --> 01:45:03.720]  university just finished the study and analyze what influenced to the average individual voters have
[01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:09.560]  on the policies of the u.s government and pristine university said zero they said that the average
[01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:15.480]  voter the average person has no that's a special interest coup d'etat yep uh and the interest is
[01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:20.280]  the people that provide the money to washington and we're talking about the pharmaceutical
[01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:26.360]  industry uh the industrial security complex we're talking about the bank oh now you're anti troops
[01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:31.320]  oh eisenhower warned too i guess he's bad sorry well you know admission to that i think the greatest
[01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:37.960]  thing we can do to support our troops is to keep them out of wars that they have no business being
[01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:43.720]  exactly why did we arm al-qaeda this the frisarian army now they're isis the cia did now the army
[01:45:43.720 --> 01:45:49.240]  has to go fight them good question so we so we've got to recognize that we have no influence on
[01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:54.840]  washington everybody's been bought and paid for and i've spoken this to uh my senators and i've
[01:45:54.840 --> 01:46:03.880]  spoken this to my con what did chris say when you said that i uh ted cruise liked the guy but i vetted
[01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:09.640]  him and i don't trust him i believe that he's given himself over to to up to the to the elite to the
[01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:15.080]  establishment and and in fact you know we can't go into all that but the only guy i've got any hope
[01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:19.880]  for right now is ran paul and i've met ran paul talked to ran paul tell me about i mean i know him
[01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:25.320]  as well done for 20 years tell tell me you're but i haven't talked to him in years tell me what you
[01:46:25.320 --> 01:46:31.160]  got from meeting with him but two things the first thing is is that that i'm convinced he's his
[01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:35.720]  that he's the son of his father and i'm a big fan of his that's why they hate him they know he's for
[01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:41.480]  real yeah but the other thing is he's also smart and he's staying in the middle to stay electable
[01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:49.240]  and they know he's doing that so so uh i i believe that if he gets elected by staying in the middle
[01:46:49.240 --> 01:46:53.800]  that he'll be the son of his father when he when he's in power and that's exactly what
[01:46:54.440 --> 01:46:59.560]  the atlantic of the new york times and others say they know they've they've had his phones tab
[01:46:59.560 --> 01:47:06.120]  they know the whole deal he's he's his dad yeah and just as good uh a patriot uh and they hate his
[01:47:06.120 --> 01:47:11.160]  guts that that's why i think ran paul is the best quite frankly ted cruise is probably slicker
[01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:15.080]  uh and it would be better than hillary clinton i mean you know i don't think ted cruise is a bad
[01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:22.360]  guy but i think he's he's just compromised at at at at at the highest levels kind of with that
[01:47:22.360 --> 01:47:27.640]  republican power structure the mitch mcconnell's right now that are trying to sign us on the tpp
[01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:34.120]  it's it's insane but you know alex and i think you'd agree with me uh uh there's not going to be a
[01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:39.560]  political solution to this problem that the only solution is of enough people wake up and begin to
[01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:46.920]  think they begin to critically think and begin to to pursue truth and and and and invest the time
[01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:53.400]  and effort uh you told me you've developed a plan and you're a guy that set up more franchises in
[01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:57.160]  the world than anybody ever has even more that's more than mcdonnell's i mean you know the most
[01:47:57.160 --> 01:48:03.640]  successful franchise ever uh so so you're not organized things boy i don't wish i did uh explained
[01:48:03.640 --> 01:48:10.200]  him a great great thing my crew's starting to get good at it uh but but how would you organize uh
[01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:14.680]  simply put a way to take things back because i just organically know if we expose the tyranny
[01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:19.240]  the fraud of the system there'll be enough people in the system that basically leak the truth that
[01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:24.360]  it comes down but i was kind of wrong because now we just know we're slaves and the globalists are
[01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:29.320]  sitting there pointing a gun at this one yeah okay i took over i mean you know i i think the message
[01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:35.800]  has to be uh fairly simple and and that's where the you know this is so complex you know the
[01:48:35.800 --> 01:48:42.760]  derivatives in the in the the money printing you get into that and it's so complex that it's it's
[01:48:42.760 --> 01:48:47.240]  difficult for people to grasp it so you've got to keep the message simple you know and again i i
[01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:52.360]  think there's three things that that if we stay focused on message and the first one is is that
[01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:57.800]  our government in washington is bought and paid for by the money dentress we have no influence
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:03.160]  i uh we're not going to get anybody elected that's going to change anything uh because
[01:49:03.160 --> 01:49:07.720]  number two the message is controlled uh the mainstream media this is the second thing
[01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:12.600]  people need to realize 98 percent of it is owned by six corporations and it's scripted
[01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:17.880]  and they're not going to go off message there's too much money involved so the third point is
[01:49:17.880 --> 01:49:23.400]  is it's up to two individuals to begin to think and to think clearly to think critically
[01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:28.920]  and to pursue truth thank god for alternative media thank god for your oh please don't thank you
[01:49:28.920 --> 01:49:34.360]  well this is so important because the outlets for truth are narrowed now but they exist
[01:49:35.080 --> 01:49:38.600]  in and in alternative there's real danger they're trying to shut them down it's here on the news
[01:49:38.600 --> 01:49:44.280]  today go ahead you bet you they are they realize that uh that that people that are fully aware
[01:49:44.280 --> 01:49:49.480]  are not going to tolerate the loss of the freedoms either through these executive orders that defy
[01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:54.600]  the constitution uh or the national defense authorization act or the spending of money
[01:49:54.600 --> 01:49:58.600]  you know you know your parents are retired uh they're supposed to live off their savings
[01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:03.320]  they're supposed to get six percent interest and enjoy the the benefits of what they've saved
[01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:07.880]  their lives for well they're getting nothing uh you know point six percent interest if they're
[01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:13.080]  lucky or point oh six percent interest uh our government through its monetary policy have
[01:50:13.080 --> 01:50:18.200]  destroyed the life taken trillions of dollars from our parents who saved and prepared for
[01:50:18.200 --> 01:50:24.760]  retirement where's the the outrage over this this is insane and it's supposed to be to to to
[01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:30.280]  stimulate the economy well we just had a negative first quarter we're about to have another negative
[01:50:30.280 --> 01:50:35.320]  there is no stimulation of the economy all there is is massive debts that have been placed on the
[01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:40.760]  backs of not our children and grandchildren because it's not going to last that long this massive debt

[02:00:51.480 --> 02:00:55.320]  segment most of them do but i decided to do this set of stations having to carry propaganda news

[02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:08.120]  is interesting because back when men were men and of course your dad was great buddies with steve mcqueen
[02:01:08.120 --> 02:01:12.920]  i mean it's chuck norris i mean you know steve mcqueen discovers chuck norris or i mean i mean
[02:01:12.920 --> 02:01:18.600]  it's just amazing uh but we'll get into all that but getting back into jade helm i i want to ask
[02:01:18.600 --> 02:01:23.000]  you mr norris what do you think about the big freak out about it because quite frankly it's
[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:26.680]  just one more conditioning to have trips on the streets we didn't say it was that big a deal but
[02:01:26.680 --> 02:01:31.880]  now they're freaking out so bad did you think we hit on something bigger because now we're learning
[02:01:31.880 --> 02:01:39.080]  it is about domestic operations for sure well let me let me say this to you i've had my head
[02:01:39.080 --> 02:01:47.160]  buried in an editing studio for four months um i know about jade helm and i know my dad is very
[02:01:47.160 --> 02:01:54.440]  much an advocate for the anti jade helm um and he's mr military yeah he has the contacts absolutely
[02:01:54.440 --> 02:02:01.800]  he hands out the uh the the the bronze stars and grusher muddle honors yes and so i know jade helm
[02:02:01.800 --> 02:02:07.800]  gary really knows jade helm and what i do know is that my dad said that the troops were kind of
[02:02:07.800 --> 02:02:14.280]  budding up to his ranch and um if i could just say something to them don't do it
[02:02:16.840 --> 02:02:23.720]  and also if any troops back up to gary haven's ranch don't do it seriously you've got armed
[02:02:23.720 --> 02:02:30.360]  helicopters i see my range is three miles from north for here i think i'm out of luck on this
[02:02:30.360 --> 02:02:33.800]  well we all know the truth the troops are awesome they are the most and i'm not kissing
[02:02:33.800 --> 02:02:37.080]  their butt because you still i didn't like all this the establishment using and to make themselves
[02:02:37.080 --> 02:02:41.640]  look good oh the troops are great but then i found out they are the most away group i mean they are
[02:02:41.640 --> 02:02:48.520]  great absolutely we had a number of uh actual military men on our film um that are part of a
[02:02:48.520 --> 02:02:55.320]  security team now but these are all guys that have had four or five six tours of iraq afghanistan
[02:02:56.120 --> 02:03:02.200]  and um the troops are awake let me mention something too one of the messages in our movie
[02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:10.280]  was to tell the troops that they don't have to obey unconstitutional orders for example if
[02:03:10.280 --> 02:03:14.840]  they're ordered to fire an american citizens or disarm american citizens in violation of the
[02:03:14.840 --> 02:03:18.920]  second amendment that they should think about it and this is what's new about this they watch the
[02:03:18.920 --> 02:03:23.800]  movie they're going to think about it now they're going to think about well in advance from the time
[02:03:23.800 --> 02:03:31.720]  there that they're ordered to do it and so getting them to to spend some time on that now may save
[02:03:31.720 --> 02:03:38.360]  us and them from from uh from obeying illegal order there's the providence again i i wish you
[02:03:38.360 --> 02:03:42.120]  would have i should have thought to record that dinner we had and then talking at night after the
[02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:49.880]  shoot because it was it's providence i mean i cannot i don't think i've ever experienced something

[02:10:00.120 --> 02:10:05.960]  possibility you said i believe this is happening and it was so convincing you said it was such
[02:10:05.960 --> 02:10:10.360]  gravitas that i got really excited buckley was there my cousin you'd leave the room and

[02:10:19.160 --> 02:10:22.680]  these people tens of millions of dollars trying to get them to stop selling out america and keep
[02:10:22.680 --> 02:10:26.760]  our jobs here but they won't do it so now i'm gonna start making films i mean alex and you need to
[02:10:26.760 --> 02:10:32.120]  do this and that so go through that providential stuff in your meetings uh you know multi hour
[02:10:32.120 --> 02:10:37.800]  long meetings with the governor private meetings you name it uh and and and and talking to him about
[02:10:37.800 --> 02:10:43.880]  this big choice he would have coming up very soon this was just four months ago yeah let's uh let's
[02:10:43.880 --> 02:10:48.520]  start with what happened this last two weeks and for people that may not be aware the governor of
[02:10:48.520 --> 02:10:57.000]  texas greg abbott uh ordered the the texas national guard to observe the military the special ops
[02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:02.600]  that are doing jade hillan that's a remarkable thing and he took tremendous ridicule in the in
[02:11:02.600 --> 02:11:08.680]  the mainstream media over over uh standing up and in protecting his citizens what a novel idea
[02:11:08.680 --> 02:11:13.720]  protect the citizens that elected you i'm really proud of him uh it took a lot of courage to do
[02:11:13.720 --> 02:11:19.240]  that uh you know we go back uh i retired a couple years ago and was looking for something important
[02:11:19.240 --> 02:11:27.400]  to do and i i felt like that that i had a an opportunity and a duty to to to educate people
[02:11:27.400 --> 02:11:32.520]  to help them to to influence the culture and the greatest threat to our culture right now
[02:11:32.520 --> 02:11:40.040]  is is is the the usurpation of our constitution that protects our freedoms and so using media
[02:11:40.040 --> 02:11:46.680]  using uh movies which are entertaining to to teach people uh was what i decided to do and of course
[02:11:46.680 --> 02:11:52.760]  i partnered with mike norris chuck son uh and we began to make movies now this movie uh uh mike
[02:11:52.760 --> 02:11:58.520]  and i wrote the script over last year we didn't realize how tom he was going to be but the byline
[02:11:58.520 --> 02:12:04.680]  of the movie is a true story that hasn't happened yet and now here we are we're in the editing process
[02:12:04.680 --> 02:12:09.800]  and a lot of the things depicted in the movie are happening for example we talk about the national
[02:12:09.800 --> 02:12:14.840]  defense authorization act that was passed over the last few years which which completely takes
[02:12:14.840 --> 02:12:21.720]  away uh due process in our constitution today in america uh you can be arrested under nothing but
[02:12:21.720 --> 02:12:28.440]  suspicion uh of of terrorism and disappeared incarcerated not be told where you are that's
[02:12:28.440 --> 02:12:34.040]  exactly right not have legal defense not face your accuser and you could be held indefinitely
[02:12:34.040 --> 02:12:41.240]  that's insane in an america but it it is in law codified in law today and now the government's
[02:12:41.240 --> 02:12:45.640]  saying it's for the veterans and the gun owners and the christians oh how dare governor abed be
[02:12:45.640 --> 02:12:52.680]  concerned or chuck norris or or louis gohmert how dare the congressman care so getting people to
[02:12:52.680 --> 02:12:58.120]  to to become aware of what our government has done uh to threaten their freedoms is really the mission
[02:12:58.120 --> 02:13:03.160]  we're on right now this movie is helping us to accomplish that because it tells the story and
[02:13:03.160 --> 02:13:09.000]  demonstrates it it shows it you know his troops come to my ranch and try to take my resources
[02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:14.520]  and in fact there's a great scene uh you know i'm a helicopter pilot so uh i uh i have a helicopter
[02:13:14.520 --> 02:13:21.000]  battle with a hui uh flown by the top helicopter stunt pilot in the world and we do a a dance in
[02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:25.400]  the sky where he's trying to get missile locks i should add dangerous dance from what i mean this
[02:13:25.400 --> 02:13:31.240]  is this is oh the executive producer is flying his own helicopter you know thirty not crosswind
[02:13:31.240 --> 02:13:35.560]  fifteen feet from the other helicopter it was just it was so cool getting to do that but you
[02:13:35.560 --> 02:13:41.240]  know it's fun uh and yet it's very serious uh people need to wear what's really going on and
[02:13:41.240 --> 02:13:45.800]  these are not you know things that might happen this is stuff that's codified in the law today
[02:13:45.800 --> 02:13:49.800]  that are a direct threat to our freedoms so we're telling that story and they're in a financial
[02:13:49.800 --> 02:13:54.360]  collapse they say they're going to seize infrastructure and land and have forced labor
[02:13:54.360 --> 02:14:01.480]  and in this financial collapse that is imminent i mean you can't print money and and buy your own
[02:14:01.480 --> 02:14:06.920]  debt indefinitely if you could do that zimbabwe would be one heck of a success story or why mar
[02:14:06.920 --> 02:14:13.720]  germany yeah by the way we have two curves in zimbabwe so i uh quite successful by the way
[02:14:13.720 --> 02:14:19.400]  so i you know i in my worldwide experience been in 90 countries including 200 locations in ukraine
[02:14:19.400 --> 02:14:23.800]  you know is really giving me an insight uh much broader than you would expect aren't the ukrainian
[02:14:23.800 --> 02:14:29.480]  ladies beautiful oh they all are over there it's amazing uh and i like to take a little credit for
[02:14:29.480 --> 02:14:33.640]  it so we've been there you gotta work it out ending them up and uh in helping them restore their
[02:14:33.640 --> 02:14:39.560]  beauty uh but back to the governor one of the the the opportunities i had was to to really speak
[02:14:39.560 --> 02:14:47.480]  truth to power and uh i believe the texas government is an amazing thing uh i was one of 150 people
[02:14:47.480 --> 02:14:52.600]  on the platform uh on the podium when the governor gave us his speech and he and the lieutenant
[02:14:52.600 --> 02:14:58.920]  governor they said to the public and not a lot of people saw this they said we will sign no laws
[02:14:58.920 --> 02:15:04.120]  that are not consistent with our judo-christian values you would not have heard that from any
[02:15:04.120 --> 02:15:08.520]  platform in any state in the country but texas in a world of universal deceit telling the
[02:15:08.520 --> 02:15:12.760]  truth is a revolutionary act towards our will that's exactly right well i believe that and i
[02:15:12.760 --> 02:15:18.600]  believe god has shown me that texas is going to be a sanctuary uh god has given us good
[02:15:18.600 --> 02:15:23.880]  governance see my uncle said that really yeah he died last year but he he he was a very deep
[02:15:23.880 --> 02:15:27.480]  christian very devout and he believed that you know the bible says that there'll be a place in
[02:15:27.480 --> 02:15:33.160]  a wilderness for the woman and and uh i believe texas is going to be a place in a wilderness for
[02:15:33.160 --> 02:15:39.320]  for for free minded people to to go to uh so the real free state yeah and i believe it'll happen
[02:15:39.320 --> 02:15:44.040]  and i believe that i've been privileged to spend time with the governor and the attorney general
[02:15:44.040 --> 02:15:49.400]  by the way who's the chief law enforcement officer of the state to to teach them and prepare them for
[02:15:49.400 --> 02:15:56.200]  what's coming and uh and i i've they've been very receptive to to to what i've been talking about
[02:15:56.200 --> 02:16:01.560]  so uh and then we had the evidence well gary you are slick i'm ready to buy uh you know i'm ready
[02:16:01.560 --> 02:16:06.440]  to buy snow cones and Antarctica right now he's like do you have fun isn't he gary talks to people
[02:16:06.440 --> 02:16:11.880]  listen i tell you when you got the truth on your side it's pretty absolutely and that's the beauty
[02:16:11.880 --> 02:16:16.840]  of it and again i commend you for telling the truth to somebody please continue well we saw the
[02:16:16.840 --> 02:16:23.160]  evidence of the governor uh uh being willing to protect this the citizens of his state uh with
[02:16:23.160 --> 02:16:27.080]  the and repeat that you told me you said it earlier but you got cut up by the break i mean
[02:16:27.080 --> 02:16:30.680]  because you told me this again back in february and you just talked to him like a month before
[02:16:30.680 --> 02:16:35.960]  specifically he was sworn in specifically you said you're going to have this challenge it's
[02:16:35.960 --> 02:16:40.760]  going to happen and and then describe how he was like really and yeah well keep in mind when when
[02:16:40.760 --> 02:16:45.720]  Greg Abbott was the attorney general of Texas he sued the federal government 28 times more than
[02:16:45.720 --> 02:16:51.240]  anybody has ever done before everything from the epa you know coming into Texas trying to dictate
[02:16:51.800 --> 02:16:59.800]  uh and he won the only 10 commandments uh uh defense he put thousands of dps on the border
[02:16:59.800 --> 02:17:04.600]  and they're trying they're calling him a cook trying to remove them so this man is already
[02:17:04.600 --> 02:17:09.800]  very very knowledgeable in the overreach of the federal government uh but i was in a meeting with
[02:17:09.800 --> 02:17:17.160]  him uh early on and i said you realize that uh the president can take command of the texas
[02:17:17.160 --> 02:17:23.480]  national guard away from you uh and he didn't know that and i showed him the evidence of it under
[02:17:23.480 --> 02:17:29.800]  under national defense authorization act and he was pretty astounding 2007 yeah uh well the 2012
[02:17:29.800 --> 02:17:33.160]  was really the nasty one you're right but did he start with the john warren defense authorization
[02:17:33.160 --> 02:17:38.120]  acts and then obama accelerated and they simply renew it each each year and the republicans
[02:17:38.120 --> 02:17:42.600]  have signed on to this as well as the democrats that's kind of another topic but let's touch on it
[02:17:42.600 --> 02:17:46.840]  now go over it you know we're going to skip this network break go ahead you know the the
[02:17:46.840 --> 02:17:52.040]  we know the democrats are sold out socialists you know they they're they they have bought openly
[02:17:52.040 --> 02:17:58.040]  even yeah and and and when you know your enemy that's one thing but the republicans uh the
[02:17:58.040 --> 02:18:03.400]  establishment republicans are the enemy in our own camp they're the real danger i was explaining
[02:18:03.400 --> 02:18:07.960]  this to john corning senator corning from texas you know tell the crowd right out there there's
[02:18:07.960 --> 02:18:14.120]  a camera okay i said senator uh you know you've got one foot in the conservative camp in one foot
[02:18:14.120 --> 02:18:21.000]  in the establishment camp uh you need to make your mind up because when you're you are an enemy in
[02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:25.960]  our camp and you're more dangerous than an enemy on our on our border and you've got to make your
[02:18:25.960 --> 02:18:31.720]  mind up and has he had an interesting response gary i can't disagree with the thing you said
[02:18:32.360 --> 02:18:37.480]  that's pretty astounding well he admitted he's an enemy well he admitted he's got one foot in
[02:18:37.480 --> 02:18:43.320]  in the establishment camp and uh so we've got to realize uh is is american citizens that the republican
[02:18:43.320 --> 02:18:49.000]  party is not our uh hope either they there is bought and paid for by the money's interest is
[02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:56.520]  is uh is the democrats it's just that they still claim some uh uh uh pledged to to freedom now
[02:18:56.520 --> 02:19:03.720]  there's a few good republicans out there you know i feel good about ran paul and louis gomer and uh
[02:19:03.720 --> 02:19:09.080]  roger williams is my personal congressman i believe he's he's done some good things but uh
[02:19:09.080 --> 02:19:14.360]  they're in the minority our our solution to our country is not going to come into political realm
[02:19:14.360 --> 02:19:20.920]  it's going to become it with the a number of americans waking up and and thinking critically
[02:19:20.920 --> 02:19:25.480]  so that they can make informed decisions about what's going on out there evidence it's all around
[02:19:25.480 --> 02:19:32.440]  us it's an info war very good that's amazing you work that in i mean it's true but specifically
[02:19:32.440 --> 02:19:36.120]  back to the providence so you're there with the governor and you say you're going to make this
[02:19:36.120 --> 02:19:41.480]  decision on a federal takeover i mean you told me yeah you you said i believe it's coming and you
[02:19:41.480 --> 02:19:46.760]  and and and we describe that conversation yeah i said to to to he was the attorney general about
[02:19:46.760 --> 02:19:51.320]  to be sworn in and i said you're going to be the most important governor in the history of texas
[02:19:51.320 --> 02:19:56.280]  and he said how so and he looked perplexed and i said because you're going to be in a position to
[02:19:56.280 --> 02:20:02.840]  have to decide whether to be compliant to an out of control federal government or to stand for the
[02:20:02.840 --> 02:20:08.920]  rights and freedoms of the america of the texas citizens and and you can see his his reaction
[02:20:08.920 --> 02:20:15.560]  to that he it was very very uh meaningful to him and in just two weeks ago we saw the evidence of
[02:20:15.560 --> 02:20:21.800]  him making that kind of decision when he ordered the texas national guard to observe all of these
[02:20:21.800 --> 02:20:26.920]  special op troops that are going to be operating in texas uh under the jade helm program and quote
[02:20:26.920 --> 02:20:31.720]  doing suspicious things and then they give speeches and admit this at one city council
[02:20:32.360 --> 02:20:37.320]  and then go and speak and bass drop the county council and say they never said any of that i mean
[02:20:37.320 --> 02:20:44.360]  it's just we have their own document yeah you remember jack lawain the exercise guy yes yeah
[02:20:44.360 --> 02:20:48.840]  most people do he had the longest running team he was a friend of mine and he used to say that uh
[02:20:48.840 --> 02:20:54.680]  that he always told the truth because he had such a poor memory me too i tell you man well all these
[02:20:54.680 --> 02:20:58.360]  people apparently have poor memories you know when you're trying to keep all these stories together
[02:20:58.360 --> 02:21:04.520]  they're not based in fact you end up exposing it that's why we have an opportunity to to take our
[02:21:04.520 --> 02:21:10.840]  country back because the the things that these people in power do are based on deceit uh and they
[02:21:10.840 --> 02:21:14.840]  can't get away with it if if enough people are thinking clearly well and that's why they want
[02:21:14.840 --> 02:21:19.800]  to make the world so complex and confusing with all these false stories because i'm 41 i you in the
[02:21:19.800 --> 02:21:26.520]  past i had a near photographic memory with text uh and on also photos now it's from stress everything
[02:21:26.520 --> 02:21:29.880]  else it's it's it's it's still a good memory but not as good i kind of you know they say you can make
[02:21:29.880 --> 02:21:33.560]  a couple hundred decisions a day and then you start getting fuzzy and that's why i want to work
[02:21:33.560 --> 02:21:37.080]  till seven or eight at night but after that i just it doesn't work anymore i mean it's like i'm kind
[02:21:37.080 --> 02:21:43.960]  of done or i go take a nap but people my kids ask me questions or family does and and i caught i
[02:21:43.960 --> 02:21:49.000]  caught myself the last few years i go oh yeah yeah this is how it is not lying on purpose but not
[02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:53.560]  being able to remember so just saying something and now i've just learned how to just go i don't
[02:21:53.560 --> 02:21:57.400]  remember or i gotta think about that and i i guess there's something you have to get used to and now
[02:21:57.400 --> 02:22:03.080]  i realize when i asked my grandpa somebody to go uh just yeah because you know you just you don't
[02:22:03.080 --> 02:22:07.720]  want to it's that you they've got the knowledge you just don't want to dredge it all up and i think
[02:22:07.720 --> 02:22:12.920]  that's where they've gotten the american people where they're just so pollacks with so much data
[02:22:12.920 --> 02:22:18.600]  that they kind of just curl up in a ball what i'm saying is don't curl up in a ball go read what the
[02:22:18.600 --> 02:22:22.600]  globalists are saying and the council of farm relations and club of rome and belterberg and
[02:22:22.600 --> 02:22:28.920]  davos they're in the news today calling for planetary government run by them that's though
[02:22:28.920 --> 02:22:33.800]  because that's in scholarly papers between themselves then they have seen an income out
[02:22:33.800 --> 02:22:39.480]  and say it doesn't exist but if you just all we do is go pass them to the executive orders to the
[02:22:39.480 --> 02:22:45.480]  jade helm document to the as a corporate executive you go to the bottom line to the corporate papers
[02:22:45.480 --> 02:22:50.840]  i mean you just get past all the flim flam and all the stuff to the heart of the matter yeah you
[02:22:51.560 --> 02:22:56.760]  just stay on message is what we all have to do you know i have it at my age i have more of a
[02:22:56.760 --> 02:23:02.920]  pulmonary memory okay i i have to take the picture and let it sit there and develop exactly remember
[02:23:02.920 --> 02:23:09.000]  it but people uh if they stay on the basic facts which is you know you're not getting
[02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:14.920]  the truth from the media it's bought and paid for if we're over in ukraine picking a fight with
[02:23:14.920 --> 02:23:19.400]  a nuclear opponent it's probably not the best idea you know these are not concepts that are
[02:23:19.400 --> 02:23:24.600]  complicated or too difficult but stay on message and really think about the things that are important
[02:23:24.600 --> 02:23:30.280]  printing money to buy your own debt you know it's a real simple concept you don't have to
[02:23:30.280 --> 02:23:35.400]  understand derivatives and all that kind of stuff just a bad idea no country in history has been able
[02:23:35.400 --> 02:23:40.760]  to do it and survive why how far do you think you can go i mean how much because obviously we've
[02:23:40.760 --> 02:23:47.320]  gone past weimar past in bob way in the total real metric of money uh digital issuances
[02:23:49.080 --> 02:23:53.720]  now they've got computers and more manipulative systems but we're seeing the signs of it everywhere
[02:23:53.720 --> 02:23:58.600]  i mean how far as a real business expert you know a guy who bootstraps started one of the most
[02:23:58.600 --> 02:24:03.000]  successful chains in history and other corporations which i was reading online in forums he started
[02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:08.920]  dozens of different successful companies and so i'm and i really respect that that's rock star to me
[02:24:08.920 --> 02:24:13.560]  uh you know people that actually entrepreneurs uh you know i know uh paul gejoria i mean i think
[02:24:13.560 --> 02:24:18.120]  he's a rock star he's a patriot as well but kind of keeps him on the low down a little bit uh but
[02:24:18.120 --> 02:24:21.320]  he lives here in austin absolutely i bet you know him i don't want to speak for him we could
[02:24:21.320 --> 02:24:25.000]  probably get him on the show i just kind of anyways i'm not going to get into that but i know him uh
[02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:32.120]  uh how far can it go well let me give you two answers real quick uh this is a great example
[02:24:32.120 --> 02:24:38.760]  that i shared with senator corn in the dinner one day i uh if you took the the spending of the
[02:24:38.760 --> 02:24:45.000]  united states government uh and you took away all the zeroes and let's take the the the the
[02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:49.640]  the three and a half trillion that they spent this year and you reduced it to thirty five thousand
[02:24:49.640 --> 02:24:56.280]  dollars okay i uh that would be the spending of annual spending of our household budget
[02:24:56.280 --> 02:25:02.520]  uh and then we took in two trillion in taxes and uh in that two trillion includes the the the trust
[02:25:02.520 --> 02:25:06.520]  fund for for social security and medicare that's supposed to be set aside and say there's no trust
[02:25:06.520 --> 02:25:10.920]  fund and there's a good example too there is no trust fund there's just i use there's no social
[02:25:10.920 --> 02:25:16.360]  security fund there's no medicare funds gone spend spent spent the general budget uh but but if your
[02:25:16.360 --> 02:25:21.960]  income is is twenty thousand dollars which is two two trillion right to zeroes and and you're
[02:25:21.960 --> 02:25:25.880]  spending thirty five thousand dollars which is three and a half trillion at the zeroes you know
[02:25:25.880 --> 02:25:30.280]  how long can can you can your household manage that budget now here's the other problem you've got
[02:25:30.280 --> 02:25:35.480]  eighteen trillion in debt that has to be serviced every month so your credit card is a hundred and
[02:25:35.480 --> 02:25:41.880]  eighty thousand dollars so you're making twenty you're spending thirty five uh in your trying to
[02:25:41.880 --> 02:25:47.400]  service a hundred and eighty uh thousand and credit you know if your household you'd be bankrupt
[02:25:47.400 --> 02:25:54.120]  uh and then if you took the unfunded liabilities it's not just the eighteen trillion our government
[02:25:54.120 --> 02:25:59.000]  does it's the social security it's the federal pensions it's it's all the other things it's and
[02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:03.560]  it's a minimal conservatively a hundred trillion but if you took a hundred trillion and divided
[02:26:03.560 --> 02:26:07.960]  among a hundred million american families which is how many of us there are it's a million dollars
[02:26:07.960 --> 02:26:13.160]  per family let's go further now there's two point two quadrillion globally in fact derivatives that
[02:26:13.160 --> 02:26:18.200]  we don't know that they say we do the u.s. they say is half of those so one point one trillion
[02:26:18.200 --> 02:26:23.000]  if you had one point one trillion to a hundred trillion that's one point two trillion can we
[02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:27.240]  divide that to a hundred million households please i can't do it i don't care neither guys can you
[02:26:27.240 --> 02:26:33.960]  know the calculator do uh i mean the calculator goes that high but i think it does but divide
[02:26:33.960 --> 02:26:39.560]  one point two quadrillion one thousand two hundred trillion into one hundred million
[02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:44.920]  there you go uh it's going to be a big number you know what it is is probably uh uh ten million
[02:26:44.920 --> 02:26:49.800]  dollars per household but you know just to keep it simple you know the real the things that i think
[02:26:49.800 --> 02:26:54.600]  the average american get the hand around for twelve million a million bucks per family the average
[02:26:54.600 --> 02:27:00.920]  family makes fifty thousand a year uh how are we going to pay that debt off it's mathematically
[02:27:00.920 --> 02:27:05.240]  impossible well their answer is army tanks checkpoints and forced labor it's clowered and
[02:27:05.240 --> 02:27:09.400]  pebbin they collapse everything we'll be begging for troops when there's people running around
[02:27:09.400 --> 02:27:12.520]  burning everything and you got the justice department in there taking some problems that
[02:27:12.520 --> 02:27:17.320]  are there stirring it up for a war on police just like ukraine just like they finance the overthrow
[02:27:17.320 --> 02:27:23.000]  there they're getting ready to do it here and i'll be saying bring the troops in i mean you know
[02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:30.520]  they've got to figure it out now shifting gears uh into mike norris and i and he said hey i don't
[02:27:30.520 --> 02:27:34.360]  mind talking about my dad because he was talking about him you know like he's just you know you
[02:27:34.360 --> 02:27:37.640]  know biggest hero when we were at dinner and stuff because you know he said hey wouldn't be
[02:27:37.640 --> 02:27:42.600]  or wasn't for check norris check norris incredibly private guy you were telling me amazing stuff
[02:27:42.600 --> 02:27:46.680]  i talked to some hollywood stunt drivers and people that i know they go oh yeah it's all true
[02:27:46.680 --> 02:27:52.360]  and more he's just over the top some of the behind the scenes stuff or i mean some of it's so cool i
[02:27:52.360 --> 02:27:56.600]  don't even know if you can even tell these stories i mean and then steve mcqueen and everything else

[02:30:04.760 --> 02:30:11.800]  feminism was a noble cause but modern feminists well instead of fighting for say paid and protected
[02:30:11.800 --> 02:30:20.360]  maternity leave they want to ban words shirts and man spreading come on that's cultural marxism
[02:30:20.360 --> 02:30:25.320]  which asserts that culture and language is responsible for oppressing women and not the
[02:30:25.320 --> 02:30:31.560]  state the truth is the state encourages gender wars it's a divide and conquer tactic designed
[02:30:31.560 --> 02:30:36.920]  to keep us fighting amongst ourselves in fact the feminist movement was hijacked by the political
[02:30:36.920 --> 02:30:43.240]  class to exploit women as the late erin russo revealed the rockefellers bankrolled feminism
[02:30:43.240 --> 02:30:48.360]  and not because they had any interest in women's rights but because women in the workforce was
[02:30:48.360 --> 02:30:54.120]  the ultimate trifecta the state collects more tax dollars children are indoctrinated at an earlier

[02:34:20.600 --> 02:34:25.880]  playing the role of right wing extremist the stigma of that label will stop up the years
[02:34:25.880 --> 02:34:29.160]  at the american public faster than any propaganda we could fashion

[02:34:52.360 --> 02:34:56.360]  government to basically bring in a creeping tyranny and the seizure of the infrastructure of the
[02:34:56.360 --> 02:35:02.280]  country just like the tpp's doing and if we ever try to say no then they bring in the force now
[02:35:02.280 --> 02:35:08.760]  without further ado we've got garry haven in here entrepreneur the creator of the largest
[02:35:08.760 --> 02:35:13.240]  successful franchise in world history according to forbes curves which he retired from a few years

[02:35:27.800 --> 02:35:30.840]  more maybe a little bit of overdrive you've been a trooper sitting there while we talk about the
[02:35:30.840 --> 02:35:34.600]  new world order but thank you for coming down to austin from dallas uh for folks that just joined

[02:35:41.880 --> 02:35:49.960]  wow the real chuck norris um is even cooler than what we heard you know he really is an amazing man
[02:35:49.960 --> 02:35:56.920]  that has done uh so many amazing things not only for the country for the troops um but for his family
[02:35:56.920 --> 02:36:04.920]  and for his friends um just a huge blessing just a huge blessing absolutely well i mean you told us
[02:36:04.920 --> 02:36:09.320]  so many of the stories and i don't think you even need that airpiece they can take off yeah um it's
[02:36:09.320 --> 02:36:14.440]  just dangling there uh i know it's hard to talk about your dad but it's also fun when we're sitting
[02:36:14.440 --> 02:36:18.920]  around eating mexican food though you were telling the stories where should we begin let's start at
[02:36:18.920 --> 02:36:24.280]  the beginning uh you know where you just ended driving in the station wagon every weekend uh to
[02:36:24.280 --> 02:36:29.560]  recruit folks for karate class yeah and it was my dad and i we had this routine we did together
[02:36:29.560 --> 02:36:34.920]  you know he'd we'd be walking across each other he bumped into me we'd do a fight scene and yeah
[02:36:34.920 --> 02:36:44.040]  we go go to chuck norris karate schools um so he ended up losing his karate schools um and he was
[02:36:44.040 --> 02:36:48.040]  teaching steam and queen private lessons and steve goes why don't you just become an actor and he's
[02:36:48.040 --> 02:36:53.480]  like well i can't talk in front of people he says let everybody else do all the talking you say
[02:36:53.480 --> 02:37:00.600]  what's important and that's kind of how chuck norris started in in the cinema but while that was all
[02:37:00.600 --> 02:37:06.440]  taking place we'd go out to california we'd go um motorcycle riding with steve mcqueen i'll never
[02:37:06.440 --> 02:37:13.080]  forget steve mcqueen tighter rope around his stomach i was on an indian motorcycle and i was
[02:37:13.080 --> 02:37:17.560]  going in circles and he was just teaching me how to ride a motorcycle at nine years old
[02:37:18.280 --> 02:37:22.840]  i'm like going wow this is pretty i talked to folks in hollywood and they say steve mcqueen
[02:37:22.840 --> 02:37:29.800]  is hands down the coolest ever had to be had to be he was great he was great man i later on in life
[02:37:29.800 --> 02:37:36.680]  his son and i chad did a movie together um it was really fun my dad had a lot of very interesting
[02:37:36.680 --> 02:37:42.360]  people that he taught karate to bob barker is a black belt um he did that fight scene in that
[02:37:42.360 --> 02:37:49.160]  adam's hand or movie happy madison knocked him out um and so as a kid i just get up i go with
[02:37:49.160 --> 02:37:54.760]  my dad i'll sit there he teaches class we go home you know go home together uh it was when he started
[02:37:54.760 --> 02:38:02.200]  making films that it was just such a meteoric rise i it was like we were talking about our country
[02:38:02.200 --> 02:38:09.320]  at that time needed a hero and our country at this time needs a wake-up call and that's what
[02:38:09.320 --> 02:38:16.520]  you know we're providing for the country a lot what my dad did back then yeah because the globalists
[02:38:16.520 --> 02:38:21.800]  were putting us through a process and of demonizing america blaming america's problems on americana
[02:38:21.800 --> 02:38:26.760]  when americana was the answer to the globalist poison just like they're doing now he he was a
[02:38:26.760 --> 02:38:31.880]  pro america a hero that people needed to notice the day he's speaking out against the globalists
[02:38:31.880 --> 02:38:44.440]  let's get into bruce lee uh bruce lee um wow my dad and bruce met a number of times um and there's
[02:38:44.440 --> 02:38:47.960]  a lot of stories that you could read online about my dad and bruce training yeah but you
[02:38:47.960 --> 02:38:54.840]  told us something nobody knows tell us some of those no i uh i i fought in a karate tournament
[02:38:54.840 --> 02:38:59.880]  and i'd won and my dad was gonna fight that night but bruce lee was there and i'm getting a picture
[02:38:59.880 --> 02:39:06.040]  with bruce lee i'm like oh my gosh this is bruce lee but i'll never forget there was a guy in the
[02:39:06.040 --> 02:39:10.680]  audience and he was look he kept looking and staring like looking back at the guy and finally
[02:39:10.680 --> 02:39:16.280]  bruce just grabbed my face and put it forward like this and we snapped the picture uh and it
[02:39:16.280 --> 02:39:23.480]  was amazing and to this day i still have that picture of bruce lee but growing up in our household
[02:39:23.480 --> 02:39:33.000]  was very adventurous uh for some reason my father was a magnet for anybody that needed help and we
[02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:37.800]  shared a lot of stories and there are all things i could say over here it is no problem but you know
[02:39:37.800 --> 02:39:44.600]  a sunday morning i'm 11 years old there's somebody banging on the front door and i come to the front
[02:39:44.600 --> 02:39:50.040]  door i open up and there's some guy there with a samurai sword going where's chuck norris so people
[02:39:50.040 --> 02:39:58.280]  wanted to come fight him these are his people my dad knew that if they were in trouble or something
[02:39:58.280 --> 02:40:03.480]  they all showed up at our house i don't know why my dad could give him advice well he was a guru
[02:40:03.480 --> 02:40:08.600]  he really was and you know here's a guy standing with a samurai sword and i just looked at him i go
[02:40:09.800 --> 02:40:17.400]  dad oh my god my dad comes down talks the guy down gets him out of there oh we've had people
[02:40:17.400 --> 02:40:23.080]  come stay at our house and said they were relatives uh spent the night uh we're all stuck in a bedroom
[02:40:23.080 --> 02:40:29.080]  my mom my dad my brother and i and and my dad's going to my mom going don't you understand
[02:40:29.080 --> 02:40:34.840]  i keep this guy's butt and he's got control of the house and we're locked in a little room we've
[02:40:34.840 --> 02:40:40.920]  got some guy walking around the house saying he's our uncle gene from oklahoma we had tons of stories
[02:40:40.920 --> 02:40:46.920]  like that it was so exciting to especially like just kind of go back to that time when life was
[02:40:46.920 --> 02:40:51.880]  simple and when did your dad become you know from kind of a mainline conservative constitution so
[02:40:51.880 --> 02:40:56.440]  he's a big fan of the founding fathers are his columns yeah i read one of one he wrote
[02:40:56.440 --> 02:40:59.640]  fears it was great about you know why we need another towards washington or more towards washington's
[02:41:00.200 --> 02:41:05.320]  when did his views when did he become aware of the new world order the globalist the the the
[02:41:05.320 --> 02:41:13.080]  larger program you know um i i think that really came on after we were done doing walker texas ranger
[02:41:13.080 --> 02:41:20.360]  when in a sense he kind of retired uh really from acting is after walker i don't i don't recall him
[02:41:20.360 --> 02:41:26.520]  um and he did expendables but you know i think after walker it gave him time to kind of read
[02:41:26.520 --> 02:41:33.800]  reflect uh investigate he's always been political he's been you know i've been great friends with
[02:41:33.800 --> 02:41:38.040]  the presidents um i don't want to speak for him he's been on the show a few times and you know six
[02:41:38.040 --> 02:41:43.000]  seven eight years ago and a few years ago but he listens quite a bit oh yeah oh absolutely and
[02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:49.240]  i called him while we were filming i go dad alex jones is coming to play a part in our movie and
[02:41:49.240 --> 02:41:54.200]  he was so excited he goes really i tell alex i love him i listen to show all the time i'm like
[02:41:55.000 --> 02:42:00.840]  i will so it's just bizarre to abstract norris a regular listener um you told me a lot of other
[02:42:00.840 --> 02:42:07.800]  stories i don't know how many of these we can tell well i didn't tell you anything oh it was all good
[02:42:07.800 --> 02:42:18.120]  it was all good no it was all really good but it's exciting and and i consider it um
[02:42:18.120 --> 02:42:25.000]  um a privilege and i also consider it a responsibility of being chuck norris's son because
[02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:31.400]  because i'm not only representing myself i am representing my family which is my father which
[02:42:31.400 --> 02:42:36.600]  is my children which is gary i mean well your dad's got to be proud of you fighting the globalist
[02:42:36.600 --> 02:42:41.080]  like you are right now i'm putting out these great christian films he's well he's really excited he's
[02:42:41.080 --> 02:42:49.960]  excited that um obviously you know gary a guy you know let me let me remember when mike shared with
[02:42:49.960 --> 02:42:55.000]  him that we were going to do this movie he asked you one question are you willing to die for it
[02:42:56.280 --> 02:43:02.200]  oh now we're getting to some of the stories are you willing to die for this movie because that's
[02:43:02.200 --> 02:43:13.320]  how important this script was chuck norris said that yes wow yeah what do you mean by that who
[02:43:13.320 --> 02:43:17.800]  was the director on that uh anti-establishment film that was killed dinesh just well dinesh
[02:43:17.800 --> 02:43:22.520]  as soon as it just got locked up a bunch of people are getting killed uh in minnesota a 32 year old
[02:43:23.320 --> 02:43:28.600]  veteran uh was making movie great great state oh yeah they definitely are no it's bad yeah i know
[02:43:28.600 --> 02:43:32.120]  believe me i'm not trying to act like we're in danger anything is i want to freak people out but
[02:43:32.680 --> 02:43:37.480]  i mean it it's it's this is a real deal i'll share that we were filming middle filming and we pick
[02:43:37.480 --> 02:43:43.960]  up the newspaper and this young director i was found in this home uh with an apparent self-inflicted
[02:43:43.960 --> 02:43:48.680]  gunshot wound along with this five-year-old daughter and his wife the people that it was
[02:43:48.680 --> 02:43:53.080]  suspicious people who knew him said this is impossible he was excited just got like the state
[02:43:53.080 --> 02:43:56.600]  center that was exposed in the pedophile rings was coming on my show the next week we covered
[02:43:56.600 --> 02:44:02.120]  at the start of the show she got executed her house in a murder suicide so we heard this i i
[02:44:02.120 --> 02:44:05.720]  told mike i said man i'm glad i'm not the director on this movie
[02:44:08.840 --> 02:44:13.320]  hey well you know they're scared of movies and your dad's right so so so your dad thinks this is
[02:44:13.320 --> 02:44:18.440]  a dangerous film oh absolutely but he was saying go for it he was warning you i think he was proud
[02:44:18.440 --> 02:44:26.600]  i i think um i think we need to be more bold i agree we need to speak up now well look you're
[02:44:26.600 --> 02:44:33.240]  doing some bold stuff right now a lot and i got full disclosure a lot of my knowledge has come from
[02:44:33.240 --> 02:44:43.960]  gary don't blame me all the money's come from gary um we got to make this film hit big yeah and it's
[02:44:43.960 --> 02:44:48.600]  coming together good and that's why it's fun to come in here kind of talk about it and you you place
[02:44:48.600 --> 02:44:55.960]  such a key role in the opening of the film and it's a long scene well that that was just a minute
[02:44:55.960 --> 02:45:03.080]  but it was long and powerful it sets up the rest of the movie so instead of having like
[02:45:03.080 --> 02:45:07.000]  Blade Runner where there's a long narration about replicants of the future yeah you're not
[02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:10.840]  cop your little people uh this is done in a congressional hearing where you really get
[02:45:10.840 --> 02:45:14.680]  everything absolutely it was really smart again who wrote that area you know you wrote
[02:45:14.680 --> 02:45:19.880]  i wrote that scene yeah and in fact i'll kind of restate it that's a smart way to introduce a film
[02:45:19.880 --> 02:45:27.000]  yeah in the movie opens uh where i'm i'm the the the charlie gray the kind of the star and a hero
[02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:33.880]  of the movie and i'm in front of a senate hearing and and alex plays an evil senator very very
[02:45:33.880 --> 02:45:38.760]  and and we have a debate i'm challenging the government to do something about protecting
[02:45:38.760 --> 02:45:44.200]  america from its most imminent threat this is real life and that's an emp attack an electromagnetic
[02:45:44.200 --> 02:45:49.880]  pulse and uh and i'm calling his attention that the the congress has already determined
[02:45:49.880 --> 02:45:57.080]  it's the number one threat and he is ridiculing me which is what the strategy of of the uh those
[02:45:57.080 --> 02:46:02.680]  people do and so we have this opening scene where where you get a gist of what the movie's
[02:46:02.680 --> 02:46:07.240]  going to be about and what you should be concerned about uh and you also get to see
[02:46:07.240 --> 02:46:12.280]  the political establishment to kind of poo poo this whole thing and uh and it's a great way to
[02:46:12.280 --> 02:46:18.840]  kind of get up to speed about what you're about to watch yeah well it's it's it's dynamite the
[02:46:18.840 --> 02:46:25.000]  whole thing's powerful and if we just had more people doing this uh i tell you can launch a whole
[02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:31.480]  new genre of patriot cinema and just like i mean now i'll see in the top box office of the top 50
[02:46:31.480 --> 02:46:38.200]  films or so like 10 of them are christian and a lot of these have really good messages uh and and
[02:46:38.200 --> 02:46:41.960]  so that means we're starting to have victories against these people yeah and i'm wondering if
[02:46:41.960 --> 02:46:48.760]  there's maybe a sliver in hollywood that could be awake because they have dropped hints in other
[02:46:48.760 --> 02:46:53.800]  big hollywood films oh more and more we're seeing uh the people talk about the new world order like
[02:46:53.800 --> 02:46:58.280]  the captain america winter soldier yeah exactly i mean that whole thing is exposing you know the
[02:46:58.280 --> 02:47:03.080]  hydra system and what it's doing and how it's taking our rights in the nsa i mean well you're
[02:47:03.080 --> 02:47:06.680]  in you're out in hollywood some you know and if people are awake out there i mean that's the thing
[02:47:06.680 --> 02:47:10.440]  is it came out in the news that there's thousands of closet libertarians and conservatives cloth
[02:47:10.440 --> 02:47:18.200]  they have cloth secret meetings yeah uh because they're not communist and it goes um it goes a
[02:47:18.200 --> 02:47:25.160]  lot deeper in hollywood than that as far as the agenda in hollywood now you're starting to go
[02:47:25.160 --> 02:47:36.600]  go skip the network break go ahead and who um come on no okay it is there is an agenda in
[02:47:36.600 --> 02:47:45.240]  hollywood right we know what the agenda is it's in the family it's it's too it's a it's a gay agenda
[02:47:45.240 --> 02:47:56.520]  it's a demonic agenda um i saw that firsthand as an 18 year old uh you know back in the 80s
[02:47:57.640 --> 02:48:02.680]  my dad was making movies and hey let's uh make this movie with Mike Norris saying we'll just put
[02:48:02.680 --> 02:48:08.120]  Norris up on the thing and i was like great i'm all in so i was making these movies but i was
[02:48:08.120 --> 02:48:15.640]  exposed at 18 19 years old to agents that they were going to make my future and i said
[02:48:17.560 --> 02:48:22.600]  if this is what it's going to take i'm done and so i just kind of did my own thing produce my own
[02:48:22.600 --> 02:48:27.240]  films and tried to well the issue is it's a cult i mean they make you get involved in this
[02:48:28.600 --> 02:48:33.160]  they do and if you want to be successful if you want to be successful and they make you do
[02:48:33.160 --> 02:48:41.880]  horrendous things to be part of that culture out there i don't want it i live in texas my
[02:48:41.880 --> 02:48:47.880]  kids are texans we're gonna try right here in texas hollywood and by the way you know because

[02:51:23.800 --> 02:51:28.760]  i want to shift gears back into uh any other steve mcqueen stories anymore come on the chuck
[02:51:28.760 --> 02:51:41.080]  norris people want this lore yeah this cromulan lore okay i'm 19 2021 somewhere in there and we
[02:51:41.080 --> 02:51:46.680]  used to train we'd meet at my dad's house every morning seven o'clock and we'd train we had this
[02:51:46.680 --> 02:51:52.920]  guy named john claude van dam driving a little piece of junk rabbit up the street getting out
[02:51:53.560 --> 02:51:59.880]  we had chuck norrish on claude van dam myself i mean all these not me but all these really great
[02:51:59.880 --> 02:52:05.000]  people so we trained oh i mean every morning hours and we're in great shape and i'll never forget one
[02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:10.840]  day my dad goes hey let's all kind of spar around together and i'm like okay great so you know i'd
[02:52:10.840 --> 02:52:17.640]  spar with van dam uh we'd spar on then my dad and i kind of come up and we're sparring and i go oh
[02:52:17.640 --> 02:52:23.800]  boy he kind of kicked me hard right there so i kind of throw one back into van dam no my dad oh
[02:52:24.920 --> 02:52:30.600]  i kill van dam but uh and so i go god boy that kick was awfully hard by my dad and so i kind of
[02:52:30.600 --> 02:52:38.520]  threw one back and my dad like all of a sudden this whole game came on and next thing i know
[02:52:38.520 --> 02:52:45.240]  it was like and i'm on my back and i'm looking up at my dad looking over at me and i just kind of
[02:52:45.240 --> 02:52:53.400]  look up and i go mom and boy did i learn a very valuable i was talking to joe rogan who in his
[02:52:53.400 --> 02:52:58.760]  own right was a champion tycoon oh god in in his way those of ufc and and and he was saying he was
[02:52:58.760 --> 02:53:04.120]  saying if chuck norris was doing 25 30 today he'd be a top ufc contender because he was the smartest
[02:53:04.120 --> 02:53:10.920]  fighter he wasn't the strongest he wasn't the fastest he was the smartest and that is something
[02:53:10.920 --> 02:53:19.400]  i admire so much about my dad is he will set one goal and he will fight and go after that one goal
[02:53:19.400 --> 02:53:25.800]  if it's picking up this coffee cup man he will make that happen but my father's lived that as a creed
[02:53:25.800 --> 02:53:32.600]  his whole life setting goals for yourself and achieving small goals at a time for the ultimate
[02:53:32.600 --> 02:53:39.000]  plan um so these are awesome things that i've been able to take away from my father and and
[02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:45.160]  implement into my own life as well as a lot of things gary has brought into my wife valeri and
[02:53:45.160 --> 02:53:51.400]  i's world with our kids just having somebody you guys are good buddies you know what he's the best
[02:53:51.400 --> 02:53:56.040]  i i mean you guys have no idea if you really got to spend some time with them oh he's definitely
[02:53:56.040 --> 02:54:00.120]  magnetic he is he was saying he's going to mentor me on some business stuff i really appreciate it
[02:54:00.120 --> 02:54:05.560]  yeah oh gosh anyways we're about to finish up this hour to five minutes over we're gonna get some
[02:54:05.560 --> 02:54:12.840]  lunch you guys have been awesome but specifically well i mean he writes about it world that daily
[02:54:13.800 --> 02:54:17.240]  and i guess we could try to get your dad back on i know he's just been super busy i don't i don't
[02:54:17.240 --> 02:54:24.200]  like to bug him a lot all the ranch absolutely but but um i guess he likes huckabee and i saw huckabee
[02:54:24.200 --> 02:54:28.600]  come out and criticize uh the tsa the other day i think you know he said why are we groping grandma
[02:54:28.600 --> 02:54:33.720]  and we got isas terrorists attacking um i wish chuck norris would run for president
[02:54:35.080 --> 02:54:41.880]  yeah you know what i think uh i think what he's doing is going to help us much more than if chuck
[02:54:41.880 --> 02:54:47.000]  norris were president no i hear you let me ask you this question did you did you ever see your dad
[02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:53.880]  outside of a match uh have to like defend himself or somebody else and take somebody out uh i saw
[02:54:53.880 --> 02:55:01.240]  him come very close one time and um one thing my dad is a master of is self-control and you say
[02:55:01.240 --> 02:55:06.600]  he was good like Obi-Wan Kenobi at diffusing things absolutely that his greatest trait is he could
[02:55:06.600 --> 02:55:13.480]  he could look at somebody and know am i going to have to beat this guy's butt or can i talk him
[02:55:13.480 --> 02:55:21.960]  down that come from being a cop i think it's part of his soul he's got a he my dad has a very kind
[02:55:21.960 --> 02:55:29.880]  soul and he always wants to help somebody and um i just think that comes from his dna of wanting to
[02:55:29.880 --> 02:55:35.880]  help people and and he's been great he's been great at it so it's just Steve mcqueen when you think
[02:55:35.880 --> 02:55:40.120]  about your dad steve mcqueen giving a steve mcqueen chuck norris story i know steve mcqueen got him
[02:55:40.120 --> 02:55:46.760]  into hollywood right yeah you know um gosh really the ones i know best are are the ones that i'm

[03:00:34.440 --> 03:00:39.560]  there was just really no comparison but not running down bruce lee my dad would kill bruce lee
[03:00:41.320 --> 03:00:50.040]  hands down in a street fight that's it hey my my dad would take bruce lee any day bruce lee was a
[03:00:50.040 --> 03:00:57.560]  master at exactly what you said he was a master technician he was an acrobat he was brilliant
[03:00:57.560 --> 03:01:03.800]  in the martial arts but bruce was not a fighter he was not an actual competitor which is something
[03:01:03.800 --> 03:01:09.960]  my dad was your dad won the world championship a lot in full contact full contact yeah it was you
[03:01:09.960 --> 03:01:16.040]  know they put a piece of tape over their knuckles oh well that's pretty much so uh but i i i i never

[03:01:34.760 --> 03:01:43.560]  busted nose and oh but gosh just so great he's such a great man he's such a great man and uh
[03:01:43.560 --> 03:01:49.320]  how many fights did he fight oh hundreds yeah hundreds and hundreds and you know back he looks
[03:01:49.320 --> 03:01:53.640]  good for 75 or being in fights yeah because i've probably been in uh if you count when i was really
[03:01:53.640 --> 03:01:58.680]  young they weren't really fights i've probably been in about 75 real fights and i'm not as pretty as i
[03:01:58.680 --> 03:02:03.000]  was when i i've been in years yeah i was a teenager and a little bit in college i mean i i it took my
[03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:07.240]  looks get in a you know just 75 street fights i could imagine being in hundreds of real fights
[03:02:07.240 --> 03:02:15.080]  with professionals yeah yeah and um it's chaos it was chaos inside that ring but it was great
[03:02:15.080 --> 03:02:21.080]  because we got the opportunity to be a father who is the greatest martial artist in the world
[03:02:21.080 --> 03:02:26.200]  and i'm his son and i'm like what gosh this is so cool my dad's up there and he's a world champion
