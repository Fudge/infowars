[00:00.000 --> 00:11.640]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.640 --> 00:19.200]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.200 --> 00:23.240]  Texas Alex Jones
[00:23.720 --> 00:27.720]  you know a lot of people are waking up to the New World Order right now but I
[00:27.720 --> 00:35.440]  don't think people are waking up to the full magnitude of it and last night this
[00:35.440 --> 00:40.040]  morning it's just been hitting me like a ton of bricks just how serious the
[00:40.040 --> 00:45.360]  situation we're in you know I don't sit here with pleasure reminding people that
[00:45.360 --> 00:48.560]  over the years I have been ridiculed and laughed at about everything I've talked
[00:48.560 --> 00:54.360]  about only to have people later admit I was right and I'm telling you that
[00:54.360 --> 00:59.120]  they're going to kill the majority of us I'm telling you that that comes next in
[00:59.120 --> 01:05.880]  their plan because they say that's what they're going to do the United Nations
[01:05.880 --> 01:12.880]  the Club of Rome the Pentagon the eugenicists that run our society and I
[01:12.880 --> 01:17.720]  think about the mass scourge of vaccines killing and maiming millions every year
[01:17.720 --> 01:22.800]  millions and millions of children in the West being kidnapped by the government
[01:22.800 --> 01:27.000]  the way the establishment has launched all these illegal criminal preemptive
[01:27.000 --> 01:31.080]  wars against defenseless Third World countries all of this is hardcore
[01:31.080 --> 01:40.160]  wickedness and tyranny and it's all part of the New World Order and I was
[01:40.160 --> 01:50.880]  thinking this morning got up before the crack of dawn my eyes popped open
[01:50.880 --> 01:59.600]  instantly awake normally I'm very slug like when I first wake up with massive
[01:59.600 --> 02:05.120]  conviction on my heart to warn people and that great danger is near that stage
[02:05.120 --> 02:09.920]  terror attacks and huge new wars are soon to be launched I have all the
[02:09.920 --> 02:15.000]  intellectual evidence all of the analysis all of the data but also have
[02:15.000 --> 02:25.760]  my gut my snout my nose and it's good and I don't like what it smells and I
[02:25.760 --> 02:29.520]  thought about how I went on air months before 9-11 took place and said they're
[02:29.520 --> 02:31.920]  going to attack the World Trade Center blaming on their assets some have been
[02:31.920 --> 02:39.880]  lauding and how I got attacked for that and demonized for that but then it
[02:39.880 --> 02:45.800]  became popularly accepted and understood or how I snuck into Bohemian Grove and
[02:45.800 --> 02:49.480]  for years people said it was fake video and wasn't real now the Bohemian Grove
[02:49.480 --> 02:54.280]  admits I did indeed sneak sneak in and it was real thought about how I've been
[02:54.280 --> 02:57.680]  warning people about martial law and urban warfare and how they would take
[02:57.680 --> 03:02.320]  over the society with a financial collapse for more than a decade and how
[03:02.320 --> 03:06.760]  I get ridiculed and then even when I put out the my ac report last night I saw
[03:06.760 --> 03:13.200]  all these mainstream news articles the women have time to cover here attacking
[03:13.200 --> 03:18.720]  me saying either it isn't true or well this came from Alex Jones we shouldn't
[03:18.720 --> 03:22.600]  believe it while the state police and the governor now it has come out in
[03:22.600 --> 03:30.400]  defense of it of Missouri you know Rush Limbaugh comes out and talks about it
[03:30.400 --> 03:33.160]  and send the Associated Press by the way they've talked to the state police
[03:33.160 --> 03:40.560]  it's real Limbaugh does hours and hours every day on radio and TV on it but see
[03:40.560 --> 03:47.240]  I'm always the one that gets to be attacked when I break it just like it
[03:47.240 --> 03:50.800]  was out for a few days and getting the attention we pointed out the Iowa
[03:50.800 --> 03:54.600]  National Guard gun confiscation drill they themselves were admitting that's
[03:54.600 --> 03:58.280]  what it was was in the newspaper door-to-door asking to search houses
[03:58.280 --> 04:03.320]  and looking for gun dealers how to lock down the tiny town of Arcadia 400 and
[04:03.320 --> 04:09.560]  something people and I get criticized for that I go on there last week it's in
[04:09.560 --> 04:13.300]  Reuters a photo army troops on the streets after the mass shooting in
[04:13.300 --> 04:16.760]  Alabama I go on there people say oh that's not true now it's in the Houston
[04:16.760 --> 04:19.800]  Chronicle and Associated Press and everywhere else and they're admitting
[04:19.800 --> 04:27.040]  it violated federal law Posse commentatus but that's okay because that's
[04:27.040 --> 04:33.120]  what I'm here for I'm here to hit the barbed wire first every single times
[04:33.120 --> 04:36.440]  everybody else can climb up over my back while I'm hanging in the barbed wire and
[04:36.440 --> 04:42.920]  spit on me and give me no credit after they're done climbing over me you know
[04:42.920 --> 04:47.240]  what I like it good because I'm doing this for all the innocent people out
[04:47.240 --> 04:50.960]  there the new orders running over and hurting and killing and I don't care
[04:50.960 --> 04:55.280]  about my name what people say and think about me but the denial does speak to
[04:55.280 --> 05:00.240]  psychology we're talking about martial law in New York when we get back

[06:28.880 --> 06:34.080]  imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs
[06:34.080 --> 06:40.600]  that's fascism it's not about left to right it's about a one-world government

[07:19.880 --> 07:23.800]  e-foods direct if you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people
[07:23.800 --> 07:27.520]  don't get food if you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better
[07:27.520 --> 07:31.240]  than defending yourself and preventing the crime don't call e-foods direct if
[07:31.240 --> 07:35.360]  you believe the official report on 9-11 you won't need food if you think the

[08:21.960 --> 08:28.520]  Amy Allen the hit Ron Paul song and made it high up on the charts I didn't know
[08:28.520 --> 08:33.200]  that after she was on the show last year that when she left her apartment two
[08:33.200 --> 08:36.760]  guys beat her up with her and her friend with a crowbar put her in the
[08:36.760 --> 08:42.680]  hospital still got a black eye from it today she's gonna be in studio with us
[08:42.680 --> 08:47.880]  and we got Jim Mars in studio so a lot of people in studio today Jim Mars needs
[08:47.880 --> 08:53.960]  no introduction I look forward to having them all here with us today I've got a
[08:53.960 --> 08:59.120]  lot of just really important news it's just every day we have more news of
[08:59.120 --> 09:03.440]  shocking new world order import than we would have in six months a year previously
[09:03.440 --> 09:06.920]  it's just everything it's a quickening there's a quickening with those of us
[09:06.920 --> 09:10.480]  awakening there's a quickening of the tyranny and people that are deciding to
[09:10.480 --> 09:15.160]  be delusional and live in denial they're intensifying their denial I mean I
[09:15.160 --> 09:22.560]  watched Glenn Beck clips this morning where he had one of the guys from Penn
[09:22.560 --> 09:28.480]  and Teller on it was Teller and he said do you believe there's a new world order
[09:28.480 --> 09:32.280]  and he said no I mean it can be in hundreds of newspapers a week announcing
[09:32.280 --> 09:37.600]  world government with the IMF issuing its own money and trillions and trillions
[09:37.600 --> 09:41.560]  missing every month from the United States everything's collapsing and these
[09:41.560 --> 09:48.360]  this is the hardcore show where they deny the new world order and then people
[09:48.360 --> 09:51.880]  tell me that Beck is exposing everything what he's doing is mixing truth with
[09:51.880 --> 09:55.760]  disinformation and I'm gonna go over it I would love to have Beck telling the
[09:55.760 --> 09:59.800]  truth frankly I haven't really paid much attention to him until lately and I
[09:59.800 --> 10:02.560]  think he's going in a better direction but you know we've really never
[10:02.560 --> 10:07.360]  criticized Lou Dobbs because he's been consistent you know he is in his hard
[10:07.360 --> 10:11.120]  core is back in bringing out some facts but he's consistently across the board
[10:11.120 --> 10:14.880]  comes off credible the information is accurate and he's done a lot of good
[10:14.880 --> 10:18.520]  opening people's eyes up to the more intense information we bring up but with
[10:18.520 --> 10:22.680]  back I know it stinks to high heaven and so we'll go over some of that but he
[10:22.680 --> 10:27.640]  was absolutely right last night we're gonna play the YouTube clip later he was
[10:27.640 --> 10:33.000]  absolutely right when he said that the hundred and sixty five million dollar
[10:33.000 --> 10:40.720]  bonuses to AIG is a diversion he called it a diversion a distraction from what's
[10:40.720 --> 10:44.440]  really going on that's true folks you have nine point seven trillion since
[10:44.440 --> 10:48.640]  October 3rd October November December January February March so we're talking
[10:48.640 --> 10:52.560]  less than six months and it's nine point seven trillion and that that number's a
[10:52.560 --> 10:58.080]  month old okay every month it's a couple trillion bucks basically or close to two
[10:58.080 --> 11:02.120]  trillion that's what we know about and then we've got clips of senators and
[11:02.120 --> 11:05.320]  congressmen women saying where's the money and private fellow reserve head
[11:05.320 --> 11:09.200]  Bernanke says we're not going to tell you and he says it arrogantly so yes a
[11:09.200 --> 11:13.880]  hundred and sixty five million dollar bonuses when they've already handed out
[11:13.880 --> 11:19.840]  tens of billions of dollars of bonuses is a distraction and is a giant stinking
[11:19.840 --> 11:24.160]  diversion I've been saying that for months I say that in the Obama deception
[11:24.160 --> 11:28.760]  that just came out but we put it in there you know we're making that part of
[11:28.760 --> 11:33.720]  the phone a month ago where I explain Obama says he's fighting bonuses here's
[11:33.720 --> 11:38.080]  his executive order and we blow it up for people where it says all the big
[11:38.080 --> 11:42.840]  firms are exempt on any bailout they took and that bailout deal is in
[11:42.840 --> 11:47.840]  perpetuity so they can selectively enforce on small banks insurance
[11:47.840 --> 11:52.880]  companies they want to go below and then senator Dodd comes out and says I'm so
[11:52.880 --> 11:56.520]  angry about this we need to prosecute these bankers it turns out he wrote the
[11:56.520 --> 12:01.520]  bill and now he's saying Obama told him to do it well that we know that's true
[12:01.520 --> 12:05.760]  because Geithner's the engineer of all of this even under Bush he wrote it and
[12:05.760 --> 12:10.800]  Bush followed the orders because the banking elite owns Bush owns Obama and
[12:10.800 --> 12:15.160]  this is such a simple thing to understand but people can't seem to get
[12:15.160 --> 12:17.880]  the through their heads because if they admit this to themselves that it's all
[12:17.880 --> 12:22.920]  a facade liberal you know Democrat conservative all this stuff is a facade
[12:22.920 --> 12:28.000]  then people will have to face just how dire our real straights are and so yes
[12:28.000 --> 12:31.560]  Dodd is right he was told to do this because the executive order matches the
[12:31.560 --> 12:38.160]  bill they both match each other these guys have engaged in this mass crime and
[12:38.160 --> 12:41.840]  and they believe because they sign an executive order are they pass a bill you
[12:41.840 --> 12:45.600]  can't pass a bill saying you can barbecue children you can't pass a bill
[12:45.600 --> 12:50.680]  saying that you know they can put King's crowns on their heads and you know
[12:50.680 --> 12:56.000]  dance around in pink tutus you know it's unconstitutional you know the big law
[12:56.000 --> 13:00.800]  the Constitution the Bill of Rights that's the supreme orders that's the big
[13:00.800 --> 13:04.320]  ten commandments of our country the military is all about chain of command
[13:04.320 --> 13:08.000]  and following orders I don't care of your commanders tell you can confiscate
[13:08.000 --> 13:10.560]  guns I don't care of your commanders tell you there's no passing comment
[13:10.560 --> 13:14.560]  otis I don't care of your commanders tell you that American citizens can be
[13:14.560 --> 13:17.760]  arrested under the military commissions act and secretly held secretly tried
[13:17.760 --> 13:22.000]  and secretly executed it is against everything this country stands for and
[13:22.000 --> 13:26.600]  the great orders from the founding fathers and they pointed out this was an
[13:26.600 --> 13:32.920]  order from them this was organic natural God-given law of the universe and of
[13:32.920 --> 13:38.720]  nature's God so military and police I don't want to hear it from you you're
[13:38.720 --> 13:42.560]  following orders jack the big orders are there and that's what you follow and
[13:42.560 --> 13:44.880]  more and more police and military are saying they are going to follow those
[13:44.880 --> 13:49.760]  orders and when you do follow those orders we stand beside you 110% when
[13:49.760 --> 13:54.000]  you go against those orders when you go against what our country is and all the
[13:54.000 --> 13:57.520]  basic freedoms and liberties then you become enemies of the republic now you
[13:57.520 --> 14:03.400]  decide which side you're on it's that simple it's up to you I can sit here
[14:03.400 --> 14:07.280]  and put out the facts all day long and be proven right on everything except the
[14:07.280 --> 14:11.000]  fact it's usually worse than I say and you can you can sit there and play
[14:11.000 --> 14:14.320]  patty cake and deny it all day but you know these are facts deep in your gut
[14:14.320 --> 14:18.040]  and your heart the truth is written on your soul and it's there for you to
[14:18.040 --> 14:22.920]  recognize or to ignore you can harden your heart against if you want whatever
[14:22.920 --> 14:25.800]  you do make a decision which side you're on don't sit in the middle of the road
[14:25.800 --> 14:28.320]  now
[14:30.120 --> 14:34.720]  literally the Iowa story about the guard we are the ones that push that big
[14:34.720 --> 14:37.960]  broke it internationally we got attacked by the mainstream media that's the
[14:37.960 --> 14:41.720]  proof in the pudding we broke the my act report got attacked still sight

[16:07.000 --> 16:12.160]  investment a bizarre article out of a time magazine saying it's a collective
[16:12.160 --> 16:16.080]  hallucination that gold has any value and they're going to say paper is what
[16:16.080 --> 16:19.720]  really has value I mean we're really entering cuckoo birdland here if you
[16:19.720 --> 16:23.560]  think that same and that we're insane and that we're having a collective
[16:23.560 --> 16:27.760]  hallucination when your investments gone up from two hundred to sixty bucks five
[16:27.760 --> 16:31.800]  years ago to close to a thousand right now golden up over seventy dollars
[16:31.800 --> 16:40.840]  yesterday my god these people are incredible also I was reminded that
[16:40.840 --> 16:45.440]  remember last year a libertarian state police a report saying libertarians were
[16:45.440 --> 16:50.320]  terrorists came out in alabama that made the AP to see these are everywhere
[16:50.600 --> 16:54.760]  that's just some of what I've got here in front of me but I wanted to bring Rob
[16:54.760 --> 17:00.520]  doing here the city councilman of this New York City would not come on I guess
[17:00.520 --> 17:05.760]  because of fears repercussions or whatever but Jason Burmes is from right
[17:05.760 --> 17:10.880]  outside the city and he says oh yeah it's legendary for police drug dealing and
[17:10.880 --> 17:14.040]  corruption basically mafia run and so we're gonna come back to a little news
[17:14.040 --> 17:18.200]  clip from capital news nine American sitters options martial law over
[17:18.200 --> 17:22.480]  political woes remember two years ago in Milwaukee it came out the city council
[17:22.480 --> 17:27.640]  wanted to declare martial law there's Arkansas and Oklahoma towns that
[17:27.640 --> 17:31.400]  declared martial law we play the CNN clips they go we just search a day and
[17:31.400 --> 17:34.920]  night there's checkpoints on every street this is the answer to the new
[17:34.920 --> 17:38.240]  America see just like Mexico's putting trips on the street so is the United
[17:38.240 --> 17:44.720]  States because the criminals run the show Rob do our producer you talk to the
[17:44.720 --> 17:47.080]  city councilman you've got some notes there tell us what's going on in this
[17:47.080 --> 17:51.560]  town all right I called up and talked to Joseph Allen who's one of the
[17:51.560 --> 17:55.920]  councilman there and we got folks the name of the town it's connectivity New
[17:55.920 --> 18:01.760]  York it's kind of near Albany maybe about 30 minutes outside of Albany the
[18:01.760 --> 18:07.400]  capital yeah so he said he actually had not seen the report on martial law that
[18:07.400 --> 18:11.600]  that that news report and I informed him of it he said okay well I'll check that
[18:11.600 --> 18:14.920]  out he goes that seems a little extreme because that to me says we're gonna bring
[18:14.920 --> 18:19.320]  troops on the street to take care that's what newscast says right well when I was
[18:19.320 --> 18:23.000]  talking to him he's saying that that sort of scenario seems extreme to me
[18:23.000 --> 18:26.320]  because that would say that we're gonna bring troops I see that's what Mexico's
[18:26.320 --> 18:29.360]  doing the cities are also corrupt they're occupying them a troops right
[18:29.360 --> 18:34.360]  and and so he's he's didn't think that martial law was gonna happen there but
[18:34.360 --> 18:37.760]  he said they do have some serious problems with the police and that they've
[18:37.760 --> 18:42.520]  had for about ten years and you know in the report it says there's five
[18:42.520 --> 18:45.520]  officers and I said well how many people you know are on your police force
[18:45.520 --> 18:52.200]  he's a 165 and they've had charges ranging he just gave me a rattled off a
[18:52.200 --> 18:58.000]  list ranging from DWI leaving the scene of an accident rampant for verbal and
[18:58.000 --> 19:01.760]  physical abuse stealing drugs and money from evidence rooms and using them for
[19:01.760 --> 19:06.400]  prostitution services that's part of the course and and in one instance they took
[19:06.400 --> 19:09.440]  a guy out in the woods took his shoes off and left him there I didn't know if
[19:09.440 --> 19:11.840]  it was he didn't say if it was the winner or something that's nothing they
[19:11.840 --> 19:14.720]  probably probably last time I checked hung 30 people in the Travis County
[19:14.720 --> 19:20.600]  jail their ex-belief chief was in prison for drug trafficking and the the
[19:20.600 --> 19:24.720]  president of the police benevolent association the PBA was reported bragging
[19:24.720 --> 19:28.920]  that he made a hundred K and 13 days doing union business and when they tried
[19:28.920 --> 19:32.160]  to discipline these officers through arbitration the police always seem to
[19:32.160 --> 19:36.520]  win so so the answer is bring federal troops and we're gonna play that news
[19:36.520 --> 19:38.680]  clip when we get back and get more comments from Rob doing here our
[19:38.680 --> 19:44.360]  producer and we've got all these guests in studio today and Bob Chapman joining

[24:01.480 --> 24:15.920]  okay this is out of us connected to New York and it shows the mindset of city
[24:15.920 --> 24:21.720]  councils who are liaisoning with the military all over the nation we're
[24:21.720 --> 24:25.880]  seeing reports every day where they're putting regular army in as liaisons and
[24:25.880 --> 24:30.360]  major police departments in even small towns and the military showing up at
[24:30.360 --> 24:34.640]  car wrecks to help oh you're not against helping a car wrecks again all to
[24:34.640 --> 24:39.080]  condition the public to accept this but here is the report out of capital 9
[24:39.080 --> 24:44.280]  news this is out of Albany reporting on Schenectady and the headline mayor
[24:44.280 --> 24:50.640]  considers options martial law over police woes. Officers getting in trouble
[24:50.640 --> 24:53.360]  all at the same time for all these different reasons. Five Schenectady
[24:53.360 --> 24:56.680]  police officers recently accused of everything from drunk driving to
[24:56.680 --> 25:01.120]  beating up a man leading city officials to look at taking drastic action to fix
[25:01.120 --> 25:05.320]  the department tainted by the few who may have acted illegally like Darren
[25:05.320 --> 25:08.920]  Lawrence and Michael Brown accused of driving while intoxicated. Those two
[25:08.920 --> 25:12.560]  officers would we're definitely going to be seeking termination and we're not
[25:12.560 --> 25:15.760]  ruling it out with any of the other officers who are out there. Police chief
[25:15.760 --> 25:19.360]  Marchair has told us you basically have to fire yourself essentially a million
[25:19.360 --> 25:23.640]  dollar fine and lost benefits over a lifetime still. We believe that there are
[25:23.640 --> 25:30.080]  five officers now who could face possible possible termination. But it's not
[25:30.080 --> 25:33.160]  just the threat of termination. Mayor Brian Stratton told us he's looking at
[25:33.160 --> 25:37.400]  all options including disbanding the police department basically starting
[25:37.400 --> 25:41.640]  over. That's something that we're certainly looking into. I think that
[25:41.640 --> 25:46.120]  that the public has had it up to here. Currently officials are reviewing all
[25:46.120 --> 25:50.120]  the legal options planning to present a full report in early April. Options like
[25:50.120 --> 25:54.680]  a consolidated countywide police force or bringing in the state police. The mayor
[25:54.680 --> 25:58.840]  says there is another option and that would be declaring martial law. The
[25:58.840 --> 26:02.000]  governor would have to declare it and then the National Guard would come in.
[26:02.000 --> 26:06.800]  The mayor says it's more for a transition to a county police force if
[26:06.800 --> 26:13.440]  that were to happen. And it could well be that as a stop gap measure that you
[26:13.440 --> 26:18.720]  would need you would need military forces. You would need state police. You
[26:18.720 --> 26:22.040]  would need National Guard. Stratton says the temporary measure would last until
[26:22.040 --> 26:25.680]  the new police force took over. Connected East Corporation Council John Van
[26:25.680 --> 26:28.640]  Norden said quote if you abolish the police department you still have a
[26:28.640 --> 26:32.480]  need not an obligation but a need to police the community. You would need
[26:32.480 --> 26:36.240]  something in transition. Declaring martial law would be one way to bridge
[26:36.240 --> 26:43.440]  the gap. That's a contrives scenario but it's not one that is beyond the realm
[26:43.440 --> 26:48.200]  of possibility if we end up in fact going that particular route. When I
[26:48.200 --> 26:51.480]  think of martial law I think of rioting. I think of Watts rights and things like
[26:51.480 --> 26:54.840]  that. I haven't seen anything that would rise to that level again. I was a
[26:54.840 --> 26:57.480]  little surprised to hear that. But whether the National Guard needs to be
[26:57.480 --> 27:01.160]  called in or not we'll take a more in-depth look on Thursday at the
[27:01.160 --> 27:05.120]  county wide and state police options as officials try to deal with an
[27:05.120 --> 27:09.040]  unprecedented situation in unprecedented ways.
[27:09.040 --> 27:16.600]  It's Connected E. I'm Steve Fair. Alright so what you have going on here is the
[27:16.600 --> 27:21.040]  feds and the states looking for any excuse to come in and totally federalized
[27:21.040 --> 27:26.280]  communities. If you read the John Warren Defense Authorization Act PDD 51 now the
[27:26.280 --> 27:31.120]  new Pentagon directives they've put out recently it says that it's aimed at the
[27:31.120 --> 27:34.600]  people at the legislatures at the governors. So they're starting out with a
[27:34.600 --> 27:39.360]  snack first you know a city of connectivity and they're starting out with
[27:39.360 --> 27:42.720]  all the mass shooting or car wrecks or drunk driving all the armies here the
[27:42.720 --> 27:46.480]  Marines are here all over the nation they're trying to get rid of sheriff's
[27:46.480 --> 27:49.840]  departments and they're saying oh we have a five or six or seven county
[27:49.840 --> 27:54.160]  regional police force now run by the states run by the feds in the threat
[27:54.160 --> 27:58.320]  fusion centers I mean there's police corruption everywhere the society has
[27:58.320 --> 28:02.240]  become very corrupt you don't just find it within the police they could very
[28:02.240 --> 28:07.240]  easily simply fire the police chief the city council can do that and they could
[28:07.240 --> 28:10.680]  that that just happened in some Texas towns with the police chiefs being
[28:10.680 --> 28:13.760]  caught dealing drugs and their kids dealing drugs and boss hog stuff they
[28:13.760 --> 28:18.080]  just fire them and they fire most the officers are all the officers and bring
[28:18.080 --> 28:22.580]  in a new force I mean you they can they can do that overnight they don't need
[28:22.580 --> 28:25.640]  martial law but see how it's just being introduced all over the news I've
[28:25.640 --> 28:29.720]  always heard you know all preachers are preparing for martial law oh there's
[28:29.720 --> 28:33.400]  infraguard where executives are being given weapons and told shoot to kill when
[28:33.400 --> 28:39.000]  the government tells them Rob this is creepy isn't it it's very creepy and
[28:39.000 --> 28:43.520]  there's a lot of interesting talk on that news report a lot of propaganda how
[28:43.520 --> 28:47.200]  you know they just may have to do it I mean I totally agree if you're a city
[28:47.200 --> 28:50.400]  council and you have a corrupt police force and you could get rid of them and
[28:50.400 --> 28:53.960]  bring in something else you know I think you should do that not martial law but
[28:53.960 --> 28:57.320]  you know have the sheriff deputize a bunch well I'm not defending the police
[28:57.320 --> 29:02.120]  and about 80% of the cases when I've really studied these it is the police
[29:02.120 --> 29:06.520]  that are out of control but in 20% of the cases you got a mafia city council and
[29:06.520 --> 29:10.120]  the police aren't going along with it now for what I've seen was connectivity
[29:10.120 --> 29:17.320]  that's not the case right it's the 80% where it is bad cops but again folks
[29:17.320 --> 29:20.640]  notice how all we ever hear is martial law now you know it's the answer to
[29:20.640 --> 29:24.280]  everything yeah it should be the sheriff comes in takes control you know the
[29:24.280 --> 29:28.080]  sheriff should be the one he's the law deputize they got 160 something
[29:28.080 --> 29:31.920]  officers deputize the good ones we exactly he should deputize firefighters
[29:31.920 --> 29:36.440]  whatever you know I'm sorry won't be as many police for a month or two to help
[29:36.440 --> 29:40.640]  CPS kidnap kids or are you know as many police tickets or as many police to deal
[29:40.640 --> 29:45.160]  drugs you know for the for the city fathers and it's probably what's
[29:45.160 --> 29:48.520]  happening here is they're not paying their cut right and probably a little
[29:48.520 --> 29:53.760]  mafia thing going on we'll be right back we're on the March the Empire's on the
[29:53.760 --> 30:02.360]  run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network companies continue to lay off
[30:02.360 --> 30:07.320]  thousands of people unemployment is the highest it's been in over 30 years
[30:07.320 --> 30:11.960]  statistics prove that in a recession crime rates go up everyone needs
[30:11.960 --> 30:15.680]  something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these

[33:17.560 --> 33:21.880]  economic news they've announced that they're monetizing the debt that is the
[33:21.880 --> 33:26.280]  Federal Reserve is buying treasury bills because the foreigners won't buy the
[33:26.280 --> 33:31.360]  debt at the levels they need this means hyperinflation Weimar Republic
[33:31.360 --> 33:34.240]  Germany will bear those of money for food I mean that's what it's always meant
[33:34.240 --> 33:40.240]  in Mexico in Zimbabwe right now that's coming up next hour I mean when they I
[33:40.240 --> 33:43.680]  thought that would come in a year or two that's coming now this is crisis level
[33:43.680 --> 33:46.760]  now we've been covering Schenectady New York saying they're going to clear in
[33:46.760 --> 33:52.040]  martial law over the entire county bring in federal troops and Jason Burmans who
[33:52.040 --> 33:55.400]  lives down here in Austin now of loose change fame doing a show nine to
[33:55.400 --> 34:01.040]  midnight here the info warrior he got calls from folks he knows up in New
[34:01.040 --> 34:04.920]  York last night he's from the town right next to Schenectady and Albany and
[34:04.920 --> 34:09.600]  he has something very important to chime in on here this is a as I said
[34:09.600 --> 34:14.320]  earlier a federal plan to set the precedent for the feds to start taking
[34:14.320 --> 34:18.120]  over cities and counties as they collapse as I told you just like Mexico
[34:18.120 --> 34:22.240]  it's been done by design Jason give us an update on that yeah I mean just to
[34:22.240 --> 34:25.640]  think that the mayor would come up with this plan on his own is absolutely
[34:25.640 --> 34:28.680]  ludicrous we have five officers Schenectady is a relatively big place
[34:28.680 --> 34:33.040]  they have at least a hundred police and 150 something yeah exactly so five guys
[34:33.040 --> 34:36.600]  because they're getting drunk and pulled over and beating people up that that
[34:36.600 --> 34:39.720]  happens fire him you know this is you know to say that's the reason they're
[34:39.720 --> 34:44.520]  doing this is nuts but this guy was one of 39 mayors apparently that went and
[34:44.520 --> 34:48.440]  met with Obama personally yeah we googled that that's the case yeah for how
[34:48.440 --> 34:51.040]  to how the feds are gonna help the local communities well I think you know
[34:51.040 --> 34:54.440]  their economic stimulus obviously they're gonna build these medical centers
[34:54.440 --> 34:58.120]  they've announced in FEMA camps with the clergy where the people go so it'll be
[34:58.120 --> 35:02.080]  advertised look they want to go in the camps that's what a judo scope does is
[35:02.080 --> 35:05.240]  lead the sheep and to be slaughtered I called my mother I called my brother I
[35:05.240 --> 35:08.480]  called a couple of my friends one of my friends who's a teacher he saw it on the
[35:08.480 --> 35:12.200]  local news but they didn't tell him why they just said they were considering it
[35:12.200 --> 35:16.640]  like it was a good thing I call martial law I need everybody I know I called a
[35:16.640 --> 35:20.360]  lot of family members everybody in that surrounding area needs to call up this
[35:20.360 --> 35:22.760]  connecting mayor's office and we're not gonna stand for this because it's gonna
[35:22.760 --> 35:26.280]  affect everybody going into Albany the Capitol and if there's an emergency in
[35:26.280 --> 35:29.200]  the Capitol oh we just got the police report let me have it look look I've
[35:29.200 --> 35:32.800]  got to go to this next guest I want to have you on during Bob Chapman next hour
[35:32.800 --> 35:36.920]  you got it so hang around okay all right thank you Jason Jason Burmese again
[35:36.920 --> 35:40.960]  from that very area of the town right next to it so he's born and raised yeah
[35:40.960 --> 35:45.080]  here it is mayor of connectivity met with President Obama at White House
[35:45.080 --> 35:48.680]  Friday morning and this is really office of the mayor so this is a stage
[35:48.680 --> 35:52.800]  federal takeover plan just one more of many where they're beta testing it by
[35:52.800 --> 35:57.320]  the way I you know said this new Mayak report st. gun owners conservatives
[35:57.320 --> 36:01.680]  libertarians Ron Paul supporters Bob Barr supporters are basically terrorists
[36:01.680 --> 36:06.160]  the governor has come out Nixon and defends it and says he agrees with it
[36:06.160 --> 36:10.800]  Ron Paul and others are saying they're considering legal action you heard that
[36:10.800 --> 36:17.400]  here first yesterday from Pastor Chuck Baldwin who's written a letter with
[36:17.400 --> 36:23.160]  Ron Paul and Bob Barr telling him that they need to retract this we just got
[36:23.160 --> 36:28.240]  in the mail they mail this to us and many others the intelligence report put
[36:28.240 --> 36:31.600]  out by the Southern Prairie Law Center guess what they've got Lou Dobbs in here
[36:31.600 --> 36:35.580]  with white supremacist and basically say he's a terrorist too so you know we were
[36:35.580 --> 36:40.720]  jokingly saying why isn't Lou Dobbs in here and now he is and now Lou Dobbs is
[36:40.720 --> 36:45.240]  bad now Lou Dobbs is a little Hitler I want to bring up for the balance of this
[36:45.240 --> 36:48.600]  hour before all these in studio guests in the financial news because it's
[36:48.600 --> 36:51.520]  perfect timing with all that's happening to give us an update on what's
[36:51.520 --> 36:55.240]  happening in the food world and that's a Steve Shank of the J. Michael Stevens
[36:55.240 --> 36:59.480]  group eatfoodsdirect.com sir what do you think the last three or four minutes of
[36:59.480 --> 37:05.120]  news I was covering well I think it's absolutely in accord with what you and
[37:05.120 --> 37:13.920]  I were going to talk about with the HR 875 and F425 where they're where they're
[37:13.920 --> 37:17.760]  moving on food just as you and I have talked about for the last three years
[37:17.760 --> 37:23.840]  everything is moving at lightning speed Alex and it doesn't surprise me
[37:23.840 --> 37:30.160]  however it does offend me we've got a situation you remember three years ago
[37:30.160 --> 37:35.120]  when we had E. Coli in the spinach and we kind of chuckled about it and said
[37:35.120 --> 37:42.400]  spinach doesn't poop the fact is that now we have house resolution number 875
[37:42.400 --> 37:50.720]  that has been submitted by Rosa Deloro I believe and you said at the time and it
[37:50.720 --> 37:54.720]  later came out that someone was defecating on the spinach in hundreds of
[37:54.720 --> 37:59.400]  sites in Mexico in the US and there was other clear salmonella contamination in
[37:59.400 --> 38:03.360]  other foods where there should be no contamination it you know it's
[38:03.360 --> 38:06.820]  unnatural just like foot and mouth in England we said it was the government
[38:06.820 --> 38:10.280]  BBC admitted it was the government that released it they claim it was an
[38:10.280 --> 38:14.520]  accident at hundreds of sites overnight within a two-day period so bottom line
[38:14.520 --> 38:19.200]  they were staging this to try to bring in total control over farms and ranches
[38:19.200 --> 38:27.200]  and shut and now we have major cities like areas in Oklahoma Tulsa others
[38:27.200 --> 38:30.320]  coming out and saying they want to restrict people having gardens this is
[38:30.320 --> 38:38.920]  mainstream news absolutely now I do want to point out that this Rosa is a
[38:38.920 --> 38:44.720]  Democrat from Connecticut you'll also notice that Connecticut is the one that's
[38:44.720 --> 38:50.640]  cracking down and taking over the Catholic Church you put this whole thing
[38:50.640 --> 38:55.480]  together with what you were announcing just before you brought me up and now
[38:55.480 --> 39:01.280]  you deal with food the ultimate control mechanism we have a bill bill in the
[39:01.280 --> 39:09.200]  House and also in the Senate that is is promoting the inability of people to
[39:09.200 --> 39:16.240]  raise gardens on their own and it's done through restrictions and of course as
[39:16.240 --> 39:21.520]  everything else it's for your own good you see if you use organic fertilizer
[39:21.520 --> 39:29.920]  which is in fact manure then that's offensive to Monsanto now Monsanto and
[39:29.920 --> 39:38.560]  the the large producers like Tyson are all behind this bill which requires
[39:38.560 --> 39:44.120]  small producers and your regular farmers virtually to report every morsel if
[39:44.120 --> 39:48.000]  they've got they're going to track every single carrot from the farm to the
[39:48.000 --> 39:53.520]  store and if something happens in the process that that carrot somehow can be
[39:53.520 --> 39:59.280]  construed to be the cause of any kind of illness they will track right back
[39:59.280 --> 40:03.280]  through with the processor out of business and confiscate the farmer's
[40:03.280 --> 40:08.640]  land let me expand on that because this is important all the major contamination
[40:08.640 --> 40:15.760]  came from factories and plants or illegal alien operated farms in the
[40:15.760 --> 40:20.560]  southwest but mainly out of Mexico just like in 96 or than 10,000 school children
[40:20.560 --> 40:25.680]  contracted hepatitis from feces sprayed on different berries bought by the school
[40:25.680 --> 40:32.360]  lunch program so big agribusiness is causing the crisis but but even the
[40:32.360 --> 40:38.000]  grid like animal ID premises ID you know a $20 tag on a $5 chicken but then
[40:38.000 --> 40:42.880]  Tyson and others are exempt from that they buy group tags so they've written
[40:42.880 --> 40:46.320]  it to shut down the small family farms and ranches and for those that don't
[40:46.320 --> 40:51.040]  know Connecticut and whether you're Catholic or not I know Steve isn't I'm
[40:51.040 --> 40:54.560]  not the point is I couldn't believe it when I saw it two weeks ago the states
[40:54.560 --> 40:59.360]  introduced bills to have the state basically take over the first amendment
[40:59.360 --> 41:03.160]  and take over the Catholic Church what a precedent they're going after the
[41:03.160 --> 41:06.600]  biggest church first think about the little ones I mean this is like East
[41:06.600 --> 41:12.640]  Germany or something oh absolutely and you see what what this what this bill is
[41:12.640 --> 41:18.000]  now you and I have talked over and over again Alex about the fact that food is
[41:18.000 --> 41:24.080]  always the control mechanism right now we have as we've mentioned before vast
[41:24.080 --> 41:29.040]  percentages of our population that literally can't afford food and that
[41:29.040 --> 41:35.040]  inflation is going to continue it is continuing at a huge rate at the same
[41:35.040 --> 41:41.720]  time now get this at the same time commodities prices they have overglutted
[41:41.720 --> 41:45.680]  with commodities buying and other countries coming in and trying to buy
[41:45.680 --> 41:50.440]  our foods and as a result commodities buyers are getting out of the business
[41:50.440 --> 41:57.040]  because the the the cost of food or the price of food is dropping at the
[41:57.040 --> 42:02.680]  commodities level and so farmers can't afford to plant and aren't many of them
[42:02.680 --> 42:06.680]  planning this year that's in all the major farm news so you're going to have
[42:06.680 --> 42:10.920]  a shortage there just as well I'm sure you heard two days ago the Federal
[42:10.920 --> 42:14.520]  Reserve has started we already knew this was going on for months Bob Chapman's
[42:14.520 --> 42:17.960]  covered it in others but it was secret the New York Times said now they admit
[42:17.960 --> 42:24.200]  they monetize this week alone one trillion dollars so they took fiat money
[42:24.200 --> 42:30.320]  the government bought from the government it's its own t-bills but then
[42:30.320 --> 42:34.680]  gives the interest on it to the private Federal Reserve so they get interest and
[42:34.680 --> 42:41.000]  profit off of destroying the economy this is a crime of unimaginable
[42:41.000 --> 42:46.680]  proportions usually in Germany in the 30s or in Zimbabwe Africa right now or in
[42:46.680 --> 42:51.240]  Iceland or other places it's happening hyperinflation usually what happens
[42:51.240 --> 42:54.920]  there is that the government just buys its own debt and then that just inflates
[42:54.920 --> 42:58.680]  no no no this is the government buying the debt but then giving interest to the
[42:58.680 --> 43:02.840]  private Federal Reserve this is so criminal it's hard to even describe and
[43:02.840 --> 43:09.120]  that means inflation is going to explode and the interesting thing Alex is that
[43:09.120 --> 43:15.120]  you're you're hearing about all of the financial stuff going on but bottom line
[43:15.120 --> 43:20.440]  is these these two bills are in a situation where they are going to
[43:20.440 --> 43:26.920]  actually they're actually going to be the the spear point of of this whole
[43:26.920 --> 43:32.320]  takeover and that is the control of the food what's going to happen now they've
[43:32.320 --> 43:38.640]  gotten mandates within this this legal structure to impose million dollar fines
[43:38.640 --> 43:45.480]  for any infraction that's right animal ID and premise society or $2,000 a day
[43:45.480 --> 43:49.240]  fines if a chicken dies and you don't instantly with a computer system you
[43:49.240 --> 43:52.760]  pay for file it with them reporting on yourself but I mean all we do around
[43:52.760 --> 43:56.680]  here is do bookkeeping you imagine all the added stuff now we're talking about
[43:56.680 --> 44:00.800]  million dollar fines this this will destroy what's left of family
[44:00.800 --> 44:07.320]  agriculture oh absolutely and it will destroy with the ability to to observe
[44:07.320 --> 44:13.160]  the the technology that's been been developed against marijuana they can do
[44:13.160 --> 44:17.840]  flyovers and you cannot have a garden with anything growing in it that they
[44:17.840 --> 44:22.440]  set the frequency of to identify yeah let me stop you let me stop you're right
[44:22.440 --> 44:26.520]  there exactly the phony war on drugs the 40 phony war on terror they're now
[44:26.520 --> 44:31.200]  wheeling the giant apparatus around hiring all these new land management
[44:31.200 --> 44:36.440]  DNR groups creating SWAT teams for them rating people selling eggs on the
[44:36.440 --> 44:40.320]  street watermelons rating people selling their own cheese with SWAT teams
[44:40.320 --> 44:45.600]  that's in the news every week rating Amish rating the local Austin farmers
[44:45.600 --> 44:49.360]  market with people selling you know the cheese the government said they couldn't
[44:49.360 --> 44:54.560]  it's all happening and it shows the mindset and now mayors are announcing
[44:54.560 --> 44:58.080]  again in Tulsa other places oh we're not gonna allow you to have home gardens
[44:58.080 --> 45:02.440]  now without an inspection and oh there's police corruption we're gonna have troops
[45:02.440 --> 45:07.720]  on the streets in New York I mean it's it's it's really happening Steve they
[45:07.720 --> 45:14.600]  really are what I would call Sovietizing America absolutely and and the one
[45:14.600 --> 45:21.520]  thing that you're not hearing about except as as you expose it Alex is the
[45:21.520 --> 45:27.360]  issue of food and that is the most diabolical and it touches every American
[45:27.360 --> 45:32.400]  immediately and let me explain they're going to SWAT team anybody with a guard
[45:32.400 --> 45:38.040]  and under this federal law okay this is we're not joking folks they're moving go
[45:38.040 --> 45:43.560]  ahead well one of the things that we've said that previously is you know yeah
[45:43.560 --> 45:47.200]  buy some seeds and start putting in a garden one of the things that we've
[45:47.200 --> 45:53.400]  always talked about Alex is that people must get in a supply two three years the
[45:53.400 --> 45:57.560]  ones that can still afford it put that in two or three years and then stay out
[45:57.560 --> 46:00.840]  of it we used to tell people to absolutely stay out of it do gardening as
[46:00.840 --> 46:06.000]  best you can because very simply as soon as this goes through unless people get
[46:06.000 --> 46:10.960]  their food supplies in before this legislation goes through and starts to
[46:10.960 --> 46:17.800]  be enforced they will not be able to transport it across state lines to get
[46:17.800 --> 46:22.160]  it from sources now here is the announcement I want anybody that's
[46:22.160 --> 46:28.000]  listening that's listen to Alex and me before to absolutely take notes Alex we
[46:28.000 --> 46:31.920]  have concluded that we are no longer going to be able to function with a
[46:31.920 --> 46:39.120]  single distribution point here in Utah as this is moving so fast we've decided
[46:39.120 --> 46:43.880]  to announce those folks who are interested in working with us and
[46:43.880 --> 46:49.240]  helping us can get up on the website we are going to open up a distributor
[46:49.240 --> 46:56.440]  program we're going to have points of influence and and the ability to to have
[46:56.440 --> 47:01.720]  available food all over the country anybody that can work with it there
[47:01.720 --> 47:05.360]  still some families out there that are financially stable enough to be able to
[47:05.360 --> 47:11.200]  help in the movement to save the other members of society that at least have the
[47:11.200 --> 47:16.200]  common sense to realize that we're still Americans so anybody that would like to
[47:16.200 --> 47:22.080]  please get up on eFoodsDirect.com there's a little button there that
[47:22.080 --> 47:28.520]  explains the distributor program for those who I who can't you know work
[47:28.520 --> 47:40.320]  with the internet very readily call 800-409-5633 and 800-409-5633 we will
[47:40.320 --> 47:44.200]  not be returning phone calls on the distributor program until the first of
[47:44.200 --> 47:50.520]  this next week where we did the weekend is just too hard to work with but what
[47:50.520 --> 47:56.120]  we're doing is we're decentralizing the distribution I don't know how long we
[47:56.120 --> 48:01.320]  will be able to continue to distribute food Alex with these regulations coming
[48:01.320 --> 48:07.000]  in and the restrictions I'm concerned that this could shut down very quickly
[48:07.000 --> 48:11.760]  but that's right because you are a major manufacturer and you're actually
[48:11.760 --> 48:15.800]  putting the food together yourself non-gmo you know quality food the best
[48:15.800 --> 48:20.440]  out there for the price and and here's a microcosm my good buddy Bob Dacey who's
[48:20.440 --> 48:24.640]  been on the show for more than a decade he owns a standalone hardware store
[48:24.640 --> 48:28.960]  here in town and gun shop he is going to be a distributor I know he told me about
[48:28.960 --> 48:31.360]  that a few weeks ago but I just been quiet about it until you made the
[48:31.360 --> 48:35.800]  announcement today and that's the kind of folks we need to to then be
[48:35.800 --> 48:41.240]  distributors in areas all over this country but if folks want to still call
[48:41.240 --> 48:45.920]  you Steve they can still get the three-day responder a six-month supply a
[48:45.920 --> 48:50.600]  month supply your supply they can still call now and do that right absolutely
[48:50.600 --> 48:54.920]  and we're moving just as fast as we can to get into prepare what we're caught
[48:54.920 --> 48:58.960]  we're going to call prepared groceries we'll come up on on your show here a
[48:58.960 --> 49:04.800]  little bit later in a week or two and announce that but very simply any of the
[49:04.800 --> 49:08.520]  folks out there that have been contemplating getting food even if they
[49:08.520 --> 49:12.400]  don't get it from e-foods direct for crying out loud before this thing goes
[49:12.400 --> 49:18.040]  through you've got to get your supplies in and I I don't know we'll be giving
[49:18.040 --> 49:22.680]  you further announcements Alex will keep you up to date absolutely on what you're
[49:22.680 --> 49:26.000]  going to have to do with those foods once you get them when all the restrictions
[49:26.000 --> 49:31.480]  start there will be some issues but right now you better get whatever food
[49:31.480 --> 49:35.800]  that you need even if you can't stand Alex or me I can understand where you
[49:35.800 --> 49:40.360]  could you know not stand me but Alex repeat thank you God I love him
[49:40.360 --> 49:45.400]  Steve they love us listen let me say this let me just say this I have a
[49:45.400 --> 49:49.000]  three-year supply for my whole family family of mine that doesn't have enough
[49:49.000 --> 49:54.440]  money it was so affordable I have bought them your supply of food from you I have
[49:54.440 --> 49:58.240]  been so busy we all get so busy I've been tending to call and even get another
[49:58.240 --> 50:01.320]  year's supply for some more of my family because you know that's my
[50:01.320 --> 50:05.120]  responsibility you know you're worried about food supplies and these laws and
[50:05.120 --> 50:08.200]  I think it'll take them a while to get it in place they're certainly trying
[50:08.200 --> 50:11.320]  they're having all their minion mayors announce hey we're not gonna let you have
[50:11.320 --> 50:14.680]  gardens did you see the video of them bulldozing in LA the big community
[50:14.680 --> 50:18.820]  gardens and people can't do it anymore I mean I mean this is getting it folks
[50:18.820 --> 50:23.640]  this is in I just played you a newscast where this Obama mayor is gonna have
[50:23.640 --> 50:28.280]  martial law in the county you know they're calling folks I know it's insane
[50:28.280 --> 50:32.600]  my big issue is if they bring us into depression which it appears they're
[50:32.600 --> 50:37.080]  doing they monetize the debt meaning hyperinflation it's guaranteed now the
[50:37.080 --> 50:43.120]  dollar plunged yesterday gold went up by $70 an ounce that's when I'm worried
[50:43.120 --> 50:47.440]  about is a depression because that's when you have hyperinflation the food's
[50:47.440 --> 50:52.120]  gonna cost so much more so this is a very smart move I believe in it and I
[50:52.120 --> 50:56.200]  believe again you're insane if you don't go to eFoodsDirect.com and order

[53:10.040 --> 53:13.880]  more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds about perform even gold and
[53:13.880 --> 53:17.680]  silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again so

[54:01.280 --> 54:07.280]  the Genesis Communications radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[54:07.280 --> 54:16.520]  because there's a war on for your mind you know we've had it so good in this
[54:16.520 --> 54:21.400]  country so long that people even though all this tyranny is being admitted even
[54:21.400 --> 54:26.480]  the mainstream news they have trouble believing it the establishment may not
[54:26.480 --> 54:29.840]  be successful in completely bringing us into a depression and martial law
[54:29.840 --> 54:33.520]  they're doing a pretty good job of it right now they have to create this
[54:33.520 --> 54:36.760]  worldwide crisis to bring in their world government that will be run by private
[54:36.760 --> 54:41.040]  banks you'll pay your carbon taxes to I mean that's in dozens of mainstream
[54:41.040 --> 54:47.400]  articles every day Reuters you name it it's all happening and I believe in you
[54:47.400 --> 54:53.480]  know guns food gold being self-sufficient and all I can tell you
[54:53.480 --> 54:59.080]  as folks that we appreciate Steve shank coming on the show and all the great
[54:59.080 --> 55:03.520]  things he does so I hope people will visit E the letter E foods direct.com
[55:03.520 --> 55:08.120]  big banners up on info wars.com and present planet.com Steve we've got
[55:08.120 --> 55:13.240]  about four minutes left any other key information well the main thing that
[55:13.240 --> 55:18.240]  that people have to realize is all of the rules have changed Alex you and I
[55:18.240 --> 55:24.240]  both talked and and we just heard a couple of ads for seeds on the on the
[55:24.240 --> 55:30.280]  break here and my my greatest blessing to the American people would be that we
[55:30.280 --> 55:36.600]  would have enough time for them to at least grow a garden this season and be
[55:36.600 --> 55:42.520]  able to get by with it the fact is that no matter what we do the only the only
[55:42.520 --> 55:48.720]  choice that I see for for my family for your family for any these families is to
[55:48.720 --> 55:56.120]  have enough stored food in immediately I mean my gosh the handwriting is on the
[55:56.120 --> 55:59.800]  wall and it's coming out and it's basically being written on our four
[55:59.800 --> 56:05.280]  heads backwards when we shave we've got to get food in and it has to be
[56:05.280 --> 56:09.880]  storeable so that we can survive this thing and then you don't have to worry
[56:09.880 --> 56:13.080]  about it I mean I mean people get life insurance when they're 30 years old and
[56:13.080 --> 56:16.200]  probably won't be dead for 40 years because there's a small chance it might
[56:16.200 --> 56:19.520]  happen there's a good chance this is going to be a catastrophic implosion
[56:19.520 --> 56:23.920]  you know we we you know pray for the best and you know pray for good things to
[56:23.920 --> 56:28.440]  happen but we prepare for the worst and we hope for the best and you know do
[56:28.440 --> 56:33.000]  whatever we can here but I do know you guys have the best food the best quality
[56:33.000 --> 56:36.840]  you know recently you know prepared and made not ancient stuff people are
[56:36.840 --> 56:41.120]  selling from a decade ago and I just hope that people will give you a call
[56:41.120 --> 56:44.360]  and I know there's a lot of folks that are in a position to be distributors
[56:44.360 --> 56:48.400]  it's a great idea it's also a good business decision for folks so I hope
[56:48.400 --> 56:53.480]  they'll give you a call I give out the number again Steve Shane is 800 409

[57:30.160 --> 57:34.040]  up would you believe potatoes because of a couple of supporters subsidized
[57:34.040 --> 57:40.680]  humanitarian or operations where they're shipping our food over to Africa we've
[57:40.680 --> 57:45.200]  got that back now it's carrots but we'll handle that but I'm telling you what
[57:45.200 --> 57:49.200]  more and more the basic items that people are going to need in these
[57:49.200 --> 57:53.040]  supplies are disappearing and there will come a time very shortly when we'll
[57:53.040 --> 57:57.780]  have to eliminate some things and just substitute just just to make the the
[57:57.780 --> 58:03.360]  units put together well you're the best and I just put people you know towards
[58:03.360 --> 58:06.560]  you I hope that they will look your direction for their storable food needs

[59:46.840 --> 59:50.360]  first step is getting storeable food
[59:50.360 --> 1:00:00.360]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[1:00:04.360 --> 1:00:12.400]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[1:00:12.400 --> 1:00:19.920]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas
[1:00:19.920 --> 1:00:27.560]  alex jones we're gonna be getting into the economy coming up in the next
[1:00:27.560 --> 1:00:32.960]  segment we knew this was going on four or five months ago there were little
[1:00:32.960 --> 1:00:36.160]  blurbs about it the New York Times in places about the Federal Reserve quote
[1:00:36.160 --> 1:00:42.080]  issuing its own secret form of currency the World Bank the IMF of
[1:00:42.080 --> 1:00:45.800]  analysis last week they're issuing a secret super currency it's already
[1:00:45.800 --> 1:00:51.280]  going on it's all backed up with taxpayer money or at least they claim it is
[1:00:51.280 --> 1:00:55.840]  and so that will do a couple things it will deflate the value of the currency
[1:00:55.840 --> 1:01:00.760]  thus causing hyperinflation while the real economy contracts that is the
[1:01:00.760 --> 1:01:07.960]  unknown perfect storm in modern history of hyper stag inflation a term I coined
[1:01:07.960 --> 1:01:11.240]  that many economists we've had on say they believe is an excellent term for it
[1:01:11.240 --> 1:01:15.080]  only way to describe it they came out a few days ago the feds did admitted
[1:01:15.080 --> 1:01:19.720]  record increases in the consumer price index and that's even with their
[1:01:19.720 --> 1:01:24.400]  cooked numbers and some of the numbers were the worst in 20 years the worst in
[1:01:24.400 --> 1:01:29.960]  seven years and that was just in a one month change so that is coming up we'll
[1:01:29.960 --> 1:01:33.400]  be getting into that in great detail I mean the announcement I should have
[1:01:33.400 --> 1:01:36.440]  error-aid sirens going on in the background that they that they are
[1:01:36.440 --> 1:01:39.880]  monetizing the debt is staggering so it's coming up in the next segment with Bob
[1:01:39.880 --> 1:01:45.760]  Chapman all over the country Obama has and of course Bush started all of this
[1:01:45.760 --> 1:01:51.600]  but flawlessly seamlessly they're continuing it like relay runners passing
[1:01:51.600 --> 1:01:56.920]  a baton that they are gonna have martial law in the states and cities and the
[1:01:56.920 --> 1:02:03.720]  tent cities and FEMA camps and forced service they have a law that's now past
[1:02:03.720 --> 1:02:07.360]  the house but separately the army issued a directive a few weeks ago for a
[1:02:07.360 --> 1:02:12.960]  million-person civilian army that will be under a draft it says compulsory
[1:02:12.960 --> 1:02:19.160]  doesn't say draft it says compulsory service 18 to 24 and that you will be
[1:02:19.160 --> 1:02:22.320]  directed inside the United States or anywhere else in the planet including
[1:02:22.320 --> 1:02:27.240]  war zones so these poor little obama noids and everybody else I guess for that
[1:02:27.240 --> 1:02:31.360]  matter will be directed they also have a senior corps a green corps were they
[1:02:31.360 --> 1:02:34.440]  will decide what you're going to be and do and then you will serve them it is
[1:02:34.440 --> 1:02:41.680]  past the house and still the public is in denial about that meanwhile the mayor
[1:02:41.680 --> 1:02:48.120]  of Shinakete New York considers options martial law over police woes it's a
[1:02:48.120 --> 1:02:51.720]  good-sized city have a hundred and number here a hundred and sixty five
[1:02:51.720 --> 1:02:56.880]  soldiers police excuse me and Freudian slip there now they want to replace them
[1:02:56.880 --> 1:03:02.160]  with federal troops the National Guard has been federalized and here's the
[1:03:02.160 --> 1:03:06.600]  press release from the mayor's office office of the mayor city of Shinakete
[1:03:06.600 --> 1:03:16.040]  New York it's just for immediate release mayor meets with President Obama at
[1:03:16.040 --> 1:03:22.760]  White House and so this is one of the mayors that 30 of 40 mayors excuse me
[1:03:22.760 --> 1:03:25.600]  from across the country who met with President Obama and vice president
[1:03:25.600 --> 1:03:29.920]  Biden the White House on Friday morning to discuss the recently passed federal
[1:03:29.920 --> 1:03:33.680]  stimulus bill and how they're gonna implement it so so it all has innocuous
[1:03:33.680 --> 1:03:37.920]  names like oh we're gonna have a federal emergency medical centers inside old
[1:03:37.920 --> 1:03:43.960]  army bases and they'll also be a stockade but don't worry local pastors and
[1:03:43.960 --> 1:03:49.800]  community corporate leaders will be there helping run the camp and that dovetails
[1:03:49.800 --> 1:03:56.720]  with the clergy response teams the infra guard the executive little spy
[1:03:56.720 --> 1:04:01.960]  forces and infrastructure protection so this is definitely a staged event oh we
[1:04:01.960 --> 1:04:06.440]  have five officers that are beating people up and drunk driving and so we
[1:04:06.440 --> 1:04:10.080]  have to declare martial law they cut to the police chief going yes martial laws
[1:04:10.080 --> 1:04:14.640]  what we need we can't fire them what does that mean of course they can fire
[1:04:14.640 --> 1:04:19.000]  them so the answer to everything stub your toe martial law car wrecks martial
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:24.800]  law marijuana martial law people growing their own gardens and you know they
[1:04:24.800 --> 1:04:29.000]  have city council people in the news in fact reprint me those it was a couple
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:34.200]  cities doing it Tulsa Oklahoma and others with headlines we can't allow
[1:04:34.200 --> 1:04:37.720]  gardens we've got to have inspections we just can't let citizens grow things they
[1:04:37.720 --> 1:04:42.280]  might grow pot guilty until proven innocent I mean they could have gardens
[1:04:42.280 --> 1:04:48.080]  in the Soviet Union except under Stalin and that's how 20 million people died
[1:04:48.080 --> 1:04:54.200]  just a two-year period in the Ukraine so the whether they can get away with this
[1:04:54.200 --> 1:04:58.640]  or not is still remains to be seen but they're certainly trying it right now
[1:04:58.640 --> 1:05:04.640]  stay with us you worry you see the signs and worry about the future you worry
[1:05:04.640 --> 1:05:08.240]  about economic turmoil and food shortages how to be prepared while preserving

[1:08:13.160 --> 1:08:19.600]  happens throughout history 99% of the time governments become tyrannies free
[1:08:19.600 --> 1:08:33.720]  systems that have any modicum of justice are extremely rare and on every front we
[1:08:33.720 --> 1:08:36.800]  have been looted by offshore private corporations it's very simple the new
[1:08:36.800 --> 1:08:40.520]  world order is offshore corporations buying off county city federal
[1:08:40.520 --> 1:08:45.160]  governments and then having those governments go into debt to the bankers
[1:08:45.160 --> 1:08:48.880]  for the fiat currency the bankers create of nothing but the bankers are greedy
[1:08:48.880 --> 1:08:52.320]  they don't want to just blow out third-world countries completely or use
[1:08:52.320 --> 1:08:57.120]  the United States and Europe to fund their operations Japan as well they
[1:08:57.120 --> 1:09:01.000]  know as they said they would do in 2002 when their documents got leaked the BBC
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:05.240]  covered it implode the entire world and then have everybody in debt to a new
[1:09:05.240 --> 1:09:10.480]  global currency and you will have your credits on your ID card and you will
[1:09:10.480 --> 1:09:13.640]  still have a dollars you will still have loonies you will still have pounds you
[1:09:13.640 --> 1:09:18.840]  will still have pesos you will still have yawns and yen but it will be globally
[1:09:18.840 --> 1:09:23.040]  set every day to the value they want interest rates will be set and you will
[1:09:23.040 --> 1:09:30.080]  pay hundreds hundreds of new taxes to them it's all been announced now ten
[1:09:30.080 --> 1:09:32.680]  years ago i'd read out of government documents this on air and tell you
[1:09:32.680 --> 1:09:35.360]  where to get them people roll their eyes and driving on the highway and say it
[1:09:35.360 --> 1:09:41.240]  wasn't true you'd lazily say I was making it up many people would that's why we
[1:09:41.240 --> 1:09:44.440]  knew all of this we've done nothing special except listen to the globalist
[1:09:44.440 --> 1:09:49.920]  what they said they do we're now here now they're announcing it and putting
[1:09:49.920 --> 1:09:53.440]  their spin on it so it's people say well why would you say mainstream media
[1:09:53.440 --> 1:09:56.800]  lies but then come out and use mainstream media no they would deny this
[1:09:56.800 --> 1:10:00.480]  existed while they were setting it up now that they're going ahead with it and
[1:10:00.480 --> 1:10:03.240]  launching it they're announcing it but putting a spin on it
[1:10:03.240 --> 1:10:07.680]  oh isn't it good they want to restrict home gardens because you might grow pot
[1:10:07.680 --> 1:10:11.360]  oh isn't it good they're gonna protect the food supply but basically shutting
[1:10:11.360 --> 1:10:15.440]  down the farms and ranches with total regulation and control that just can't
[1:10:15.440 --> 1:10:19.160]  be followed or you'll go bankrupt oh isn't it great they're getting ready to
[1:10:19.160 --> 1:10:24.080]  attack Iran oh isn't it wonderful we need martial law in the city the police
[1:10:24.080 --> 1:10:29.120]  are corrupt we need troops you know isn't it wonderful oh they're building
[1:10:29.120 --> 1:10:33.000]  camps for the tent city people and you can't be in the park anymore in a tent
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:37.360]  we're gonna make you go to the camp and there's movies every night and they
[1:10:37.360 --> 1:10:41.960]  will show it on the news and oh look you get free medical care in the camp they
[1:10:41.960 --> 1:10:47.280]  had to implode things to then play the part of the savior now drumroll because
[1:10:47.280 --> 1:10:51.400]  I don't want to just cover this with Bob Chapman and not have it really sink into
[1:10:51.400 --> 1:10:57.720]  people because this is this is the final balloon going up okay monetarily Bob
[1:10:57.720 --> 1:11:01.000]  Chapman said months ago here other economists we've had on said months ago
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:05.360]  the New York Times said it's believed the Federal Reserve is issuing some type
[1:11:05.360 --> 1:11:10.960]  of secret currency then the London Telegraph and AP reported the last five
[1:11:10.960 --> 1:11:16.640]  days in scores I mean I've got a stack of them but let me just read one of the
[1:11:16.640 --> 1:11:20.960]  headlines IMF poised to print billions of dollars in global quantitative
[1:11:20.960 --> 1:11:24.080]  easing international monetary fund is poised to embark on what analysts have
[1:11:24.080 --> 1:11:27.200]  described as a global quantitative easing by printing billions of dollars
[1:11:27.200 --> 1:11:31.120]  worth of a global super currency an unprecedented new effort to address the
[1:11:31.120 --> 1:11:35.840]  economic crisis in a day later this was a Monday they came out and said oh
[1:11:35.840 --> 1:11:41.680]  actually they've already been issuing it so understand this isn't just like
[1:11:41.680 --> 1:11:48.200]  Jim Bob way right now or Iceland or the famous Weimar Republic literally with
[1:11:48.200 --> 1:11:52.800]  wheelbarrows of marks you know million-dollar marks their dollar to buy
[1:11:52.800 --> 1:11:56.160]  a loaf of bread and you'd go into a restaurant to eat dinner and you would
[1:11:56.160 --> 1:12:00.320]  pay for the meal first because it would change on a chalkboard on the wall in
[1:12:00.320 --> 1:12:03.440]  the two hours you were there eating
[1:12:03.440 --> 1:12:08.800]  it might triple in price in an hour and a half two hours that is on record now
[1:12:08.800 --> 1:12:12.320]  in those cases the government just issued currency and destroyed the value
[1:12:12.320 --> 1:12:16.400]  and savings this is worse the Federal Reserve is buying
[1:12:16.400 --> 1:12:20.080]  us treasury securities itself because the world is backing away from them
[1:12:20.080 --> 1:12:23.280]  knowing they're worthless
[1:12:23.280 --> 1:12:29.120]  it's happening now and then the Federal Reserve in some manipulation
[1:12:29.120 --> 1:12:32.720]  its private shareholders are going to get some interest on this so so so
[1:12:32.720 --> 1:12:38.160]  with taxpayer-backed fiat money they are then buying treasury notes
[1:12:38.160 --> 1:12:42.400]  and then they get a profit out of it i mean this is this is something
[1:12:42.400 --> 1:12:46.240]  at an even worse level and so i wanted to bring bob Chapman on perfect timing
[1:12:46.240 --> 1:12:48.720]  today the international forecaster dot com
[1:12:48.720 --> 1:12:51.120]  one of the formerly the largest newsletter in the world before he retired
[1:12:51.120 --> 1:12:54.560]  he's come back with it and of course he was the largest
[1:12:54.560 --> 1:13:00.000]  private golden silver broker and he's a patriot and really needs no
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:04.800]  introduction here but bob is this not the big balloon
[1:13:04.800 --> 1:13:10.560]  going up it's it's part of it it's the the stream
[1:13:10.560 --> 1:13:16.400]  so to speak special drawing rights have been around for a long time
[1:13:16.400 --> 1:13:20.480]  the last time i saw them being used was in the late 60s
[1:13:20.480 --> 1:13:25.600]  and of course in 68 the central banks took a whack at
[1:13:25.600 --> 1:13:30.960]  at gold and that didn't last very long and then about 10 years later
[1:13:30.960 --> 1:13:34.240]  they did the same thing by selling you know more gold
[1:13:34.240 --> 1:13:37.360]  and gold went down a little bit and then went crazy
[1:13:37.360 --> 1:13:43.200]  so every time they sell gold uh the gold goes ballistic afterwards but this is
[1:13:43.200 --> 1:13:48.720]  a trillion dollar by according to the associated press a trillion
[1:13:48.720 --> 1:13:52.160]  well special drawing rights are not used
[1:13:52.160 --> 1:13:56.560]  as money in the system on the street
[1:13:56.560 --> 1:14:03.440]  they are bank to bank and all it is is a replication of what
[1:14:03.440 --> 1:14:08.800]  other central banks are doing they're just adding to the flow
[1:14:08.800 --> 1:14:12.400]  and they're counting these as assets so they are lent
[1:14:12.400 --> 1:14:18.160]  the sdr's to the banking system let's say it's the european central bank
[1:14:18.160 --> 1:14:21.920]  and let's say they give them a five trillion sdr's
[1:14:21.920 --> 1:14:26.000]  and then they can replace on their balance sheet
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:29.120]  other currency that they have with these so
[1:14:29.120 --> 1:14:33.040]  that their balance sheet will look like it's more solvent than so that's why
[1:14:33.040 --> 1:14:36.160]  they're announcing internationally they're doing it
[1:14:36.160 --> 1:14:39.520]  and then domestically they're doing it um this is
[1:14:39.520 --> 1:14:44.880]  hyperinflationary is it not yes it is and
[1:14:44.880 --> 1:14:48.880]  the second part of what you discussed earlier
[1:14:48.880 --> 1:14:51.760]  that is what the federal reserve has admitted and you
[1:14:51.760 --> 1:14:55.280]  you know on this program four months ago i said
[1:14:55.280 --> 1:15:02.160]  that the treasury i believe was secretly selling bonds to
[1:15:02.160 --> 1:15:06.560]  the federal reserve and they in turn were giving the money which they make up
[1:15:06.560 --> 1:15:10.240]  out of thin air to the treasury department which
[1:15:10.240 --> 1:15:13.760]  goes out and spends it immediately monetizes it
[1:15:13.760 --> 1:15:19.920]  and then they take the uh the the bonds that they have and they
[1:15:19.920 --> 1:15:24.880]  lend them out or they sell bonds slowly into the
[1:15:24.880 --> 1:15:29.840]  market in order to liquefy themselves so that the treasury
[1:15:29.840 --> 1:15:32.640]  doesn't have to do that the treasury does large
[1:15:32.640 --> 1:15:35.840]  tranches at each time you know 30 billion here
[1:15:35.840 --> 1:15:41.520]  35 billion there 62 billion there in 30 and 10
[1:15:41.520 --> 1:15:48.640]  and uh five year uh bonds and notes and in fact they started a seven year
[1:15:48.640 --> 1:15:52.160]  bond that they haven't used for 15 or 20 years
[1:15:52.160 --> 1:15:58.480]  and so this is what they've been doing secretly so the 300 billion part of
[1:15:58.480 --> 1:16:04.880]  that 1.2 trillion yesterday that 300 billion i believe has
[1:16:04.880 --> 1:16:10.000]  already been spent or at least a good part of it
[1:16:10.000 --> 1:16:14.320]  and Bernanke is going to be back for more
[1:16:14.320 --> 1:16:18.960]  and i figure they will lead at least an absolute minimum
[1:16:18.960 --> 1:16:25.920]  of five trillion dollars to continue to fund the treasury
[1:16:25.920 --> 1:16:30.720]  that's going to have a heck of a time trying to sell bonds
[1:16:30.720 --> 1:16:34.400]  and they're having to sell it to themselves now
[1:16:34.400 --> 1:16:37.840]  yeah they're trying to sell it to themselves uh let's get into that
[1:16:37.840 --> 1:16:41.520]  and in the backing away alex the last point here
[1:16:41.520 --> 1:16:47.680]  this is immediately hyper inflationary and that's why gold
[1:16:47.680 --> 1:16:55.120]  went from 882 to 960 in two days in fact gold is almost
[1:16:55.120 --> 1:16:59.040]  relatively in change today which is very good gold's going considerably
[1:16:59.040 --> 1:17:01.920]  higher the gold and silver the ones who are going to
[1:17:01.920 --> 1:17:04.720]  profit by this this is the only place to go with
[1:17:04.720 --> 1:17:08.960]  in with your investment money is in gold and silver and i can't stress that
[1:17:08.960 --> 1:17:13.440]  enough there are no more alternatives
[1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:17.440]  we're going to get into gold a little bit later
[1:17:17.440 --> 1:17:21.200]  mainline economists are saying this is going to cause worldwide hyper inflation
[1:17:21.200 --> 1:17:24.480]  all major governments are hyper inflating and you know obama's
[1:17:24.480 --> 1:17:27.200]  announcing a trillion here a trillion there every week
[1:17:27.200 --> 1:17:31.200]  uh basically bigger than the entire gdp of the country now
[1:17:31.200 --> 1:17:34.640]  it's clear they've made the decision to hyper inflate what's the time frame
[1:17:34.640 --> 1:17:38.720]  on that and what's it going to look like on the street in 12 months
[1:17:38.720 --> 1:17:41.760]  well first of all it'll start hitting next month
[1:17:41.760 --> 1:17:46.560]  april may and it's already begun it began in november
[1:17:46.560 --> 1:17:49.760]  but it takes a little while for it to get into the system
[1:17:49.760 --> 1:17:53.840]  uh real on uh real uh cpi real inflation
[1:17:53.840 --> 1:17:58.800]  is somewhere between nine and ten percent it's starting to move up
[1:17:58.800 --> 1:18:02.800]  and you can't look at the government figures it don't mean anything
[1:18:02.800 --> 1:18:06.240]  and so this year we'll probably get back to
[1:18:06.240 --> 1:18:10.480]  real inflation of something on on the order of 15 percent
[1:18:10.480 --> 1:18:14.480]  maybe higher and in the following year you're looking at 30 percent
[1:18:14.480 --> 1:18:19.440]  or more and so that's the way i see it evolving
[1:18:19.440 --> 1:18:22.800]  and um they are going to as you just said
[1:18:22.800 --> 1:18:26.880]  continue to throw money at everything and that means that
[1:18:26.880 --> 1:18:30.800]  all the currencies in the world not just the dollar are going to be doing the
[1:18:30.800 --> 1:18:35.040]  same thing they all have zero interest rates are close to it
[1:18:35.040 --> 1:18:38.960]  uh they are all creating money and credit i just looked at the figures
[1:18:38.960 --> 1:18:44.160]  yesterday and they're in uh tomorrow's international forecaster
[1:18:44.160 --> 1:18:49.280]  the british government the bank of england the month before last
[1:18:49.280 --> 1:18:53.520]  had increased money and credit 17.2 percent
[1:18:53.520 --> 1:19:00.000]  last month it was 18.8 percent this is a major country but at the same time
[1:19:00.000 --> 1:19:03.920]  the the the the depressionary spiral on main street
[1:19:03.920 --> 1:19:07.520]  the stagnation of real estate commercial real estate credit card debt
[1:19:07.520 --> 1:19:10.960]  corporate debt is coming due at record levels
[1:19:10.960 --> 1:19:14.320]  and then here's the big key and i want to come back and and get your
[1:19:14.320 --> 1:19:20.160]  take on this the banks are restricting lending even more
[1:19:20.160 --> 1:19:24.320]  and and and and strengthening the rules on lending for houses
[1:19:24.320 --> 1:19:30.800]  and on businesses at the time that they're being engorged with fiat currency
[1:19:30.800 --> 1:19:34.480]  and that's true that's correct and that's too fat in their balance sheet
[1:19:34.480 --> 1:19:41.360]  and keep the anointed aluminum banks in business
[1:19:41.360 --> 1:19:44.480]  so everything's being thrown into the black hole of the new world order bankers
[1:19:44.480 --> 1:19:48.720]  they just the entire economy the real economy is being fed into their
[1:19:48.720 --> 1:19:53.360]  black hole mouth that's right bastards
[1:19:53.360 --> 1:19:57.120]  bastards and they're just hiring more police and military youth brigades it's
[1:19:57.120 --> 1:20:00.960]  just they're going to turn them all loose on us stay there

[1:24:23.840 --> 1:24:27.040]  it's clear that the rats are leaving the sinking ship just taking whatever
[1:24:27.040 --> 1:24:32.240]  goodies they can with them do you revise your forecast to a
[1:24:32.240 --> 1:24:36.240]  earlier total implosion of society or i mean it does seem they're accelerating
[1:24:36.240 --> 1:24:38.640]  things or what are we on track for
[1:24:38.640 --> 1:24:42.800]  well i think the acceleration you're seeing is more in the area
[1:24:42.800 --> 1:24:49.040]  of domestic control let's call it that you know the items that you brought up
[1:24:49.040 --> 1:24:53.760]  concerning the the government being called in
[1:24:53.760 --> 1:24:57.120]  and uh martial law and this sort of thing
[1:24:57.120 --> 1:25:02.000]  uh that is going on and it's starting to build
[1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:07.520]  uh you might have an incident um maybe sometime this year or next year
[1:25:07.520 --> 1:25:11.760]  it'll get that really going but as far as the money's concerned
[1:25:11.760 --> 1:25:16.560]  uh they can feed you know paper into this system
[1:25:16.560 --> 1:25:20.880]  for at least another couple of years before it comes unglued
[1:25:20.880 --> 1:25:25.120]  and i did this you know you're looking at 600 trillion
[1:25:25.120 --> 1:25:33.040]  to 1.25 quadrillion worth of derivatives and as we found out with
[1:25:33.040 --> 1:25:35.920]  Bear Stearns and Lehman when they went under
[1:25:35.920 --> 1:25:38.960]  these people were writing credit default swaps
[1:25:38.960 --> 1:25:44.480]  which are insurance policies you can buy if you own bonds in a corporation
[1:25:44.480 --> 1:25:47.200]  and you're afraid the corporation could go under like
[1:25:47.200 --> 1:25:52.240]  General Motors is an example and they were running naked
[1:25:52.240 --> 1:25:56.480]  that means they had no collateral at all behind
[1:25:56.480 --> 1:26:01.760]  the contract that they were selling to provide insurance
[1:26:01.760 --> 1:26:05.360]  and that's one of the reasons that they took them down and aig
[1:26:05.360 --> 1:26:09.520]  was doing the same thing and probably three or four times as much
[1:26:09.520 --> 1:26:16.880]  as with Bear and uh and Lehman did and so you've got that overhanging
[1:26:16.880 --> 1:26:20.800]  and what they expect to do is to continue
[1:26:20.800 --> 1:26:23.760]  the feed money's in now how they're going to try to
[1:26:23.760 --> 1:26:28.240]  feed the housing market is they're going to buy CDOs collateralized debt
[1:26:28.240 --> 1:26:32.480]  obligations that are held by people like Citigroup
[1:26:32.480 --> 1:26:36.000]  and the question is what are they going to pay for them
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:41.120]  and recently they've done some deals and they were paying 80 cents on the dollar
[1:26:41.120 --> 1:26:45.360]  well Merrill Lynch had the sums sell some about four or five months ago
[1:26:45.360 --> 1:26:50.400]  and they got 22 cents in the dollar so what they're doing here is really buying
[1:26:50.400 --> 1:26:55.520]  toxic waste in behalf of the american taxpayer who's going to pay for it
[1:26:55.520 --> 1:26:59.200]  but it's in the hundreds of trillions there's no way to do that
[1:26:59.200 --> 1:27:03.600]  all they're doing is using the crisis to consolidate power you know the public's
[1:27:03.600 --> 1:27:06.800]  outrage by the distraction of a hundred and sixty five million dollars in aig
[1:27:06.800 --> 1:27:09.680]  bonuses whereas it's an outrage and it came out
[1:27:09.680 --> 1:27:12.960]  Obama engineered it all while speaking out against it publicly
[1:27:12.960 --> 1:27:16.000]  that gives him a black eye and his administration
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:19.520]  but the bankers just continue on as their puppet Geithner
[1:27:19.520 --> 1:27:23.440]  gets all the heat imagine if the public understood that 9.7 trillion
[1:27:23.440 --> 1:27:26.240]  has disappeared into a black hole and that the federal reserve won't tell
[1:27:26.240 --> 1:27:30.880]  congress where all this money is going the police the
[1:27:30.880 --> 1:27:34.560]  military everybody's starting to finally get it the crooks run things
[1:27:34.560 --> 1:27:37.600]  i don't think the ivory tower boys are going to get away with pulling off
[1:27:37.600 --> 1:27:40.320]  martial law even if they stage some terror attacks or
[1:27:40.320 --> 1:27:44.240]  bio weapons release so they can pose as our saviors i i see them
[1:27:44.240 --> 1:27:48.160]  overreaching here but through the overreaching it's still going to be a
[1:27:48.160 --> 1:27:53.600]  complete disaster well i think the idea in
[1:27:53.600 --> 1:27:58.400]  that respect is to get the new the word out to the people
[1:27:58.400 --> 1:28:01.680]  we don't want any bubba shooting at anybody
[1:28:01.680 --> 1:28:06.640]  so all you americans don't shoot at anybody
[1:28:06.640 --> 1:28:10.320]  don't get sucked into their trap it's not time
[1:28:10.320 --> 1:28:14.160]  a time will come when you have to act but don't
[1:28:14.160 --> 1:28:20.480]  act in some silly incident you know keep your heads
[1:28:20.480 --> 1:28:24.240]  don't give them an excuse to put you in a camp or
[1:28:24.240 --> 1:28:28.400]  put martial law in your town that sort of thing
[1:28:28.400 --> 1:28:31.920]  but as far as the money goes they're going to keep on pumping this thing
[1:28:31.920 --> 1:28:36.880]  and it won't fall of its own volition they will make it fall when they're
[1:28:36.880 --> 1:28:41.040]  ready and when it falls and collapses the only
[1:28:41.040 --> 1:28:43.840]  thing that will be worth anything is gold and silver
[1:28:43.840 --> 1:28:48.960]  besides the food and filters and weapons that you put away
[1:28:48.960 --> 1:28:55.040]  and they expect at that time because they'll have lots of money
[1:28:55.040 --> 1:28:58.480]  they will go and buy everything they can get their hands on
[1:28:58.480 --> 1:29:03.680]  five ten fifteen cents on the dollar and at the same time they'll have a war
[1:29:03.680 --> 1:29:07.600]  going on and you've just talked about a
[1:29:07.600 --> 1:29:10.960]  selective service draft and they want to get
[1:29:10.960 --> 1:29:14.800]  anybody between 18 and 24 off the streets
[1:29:14.800 --> 1:29:19.760]  because if you remember these are the people who fight wars
[1:29:19.760 --> 1:29:22.640]  not the sergeants and yeah for those that don't know
[1:29:22.640 --> 1:29:25.760]  those for those that don't know the house is now past it
[1:29:25.760 --> 1:29:31.040]  and it nexus is in with the pentagon directive of a month ago
[1:29:31.040 --> 1:29:36.240]  which is where it says mandatory service in a civilian military domestically
[1:29:36.240 --> 1:29:40.160]  and overseas it's such it's compulsory and so
[1:29:40.160 --> 1:29:43.600]  a lot of you obama lovers you're going to get the cute little uniform but you're
[1:29:43.600 --> 1:29:46.000]  going to get to try to confiscate the american people's guns
[1:29:46.000 --> 1:29:50.160]  you're going to get to be shipped overseas so enjoy yourselves you earned it

[1:35:52.880 --> 1:35:57.360]  not just mention this on there i wanted to be specific
[1:35:57.360 --> 1:36:01.520]  about the youth brigades this is the house passes mandatory national service
[1:36:01.520 --> 1:36:05.760]  bill prisonplanet.com we link directly to generations invigorating
[1:36:05.760 --> 1:36:10.640]  volunteerism and education act and it says in the bill
[1:36:10.640 --> 1:36:14.880]  it says mandatory service requirement for all able young people will be
[1:36:14.880 --> 1:36:17.680]  developed and it says that they're setting it up through
[1:36:17.680 --> 1:36:20.880]  the public private schools this is also total federal takeover of all the
[1:36:20.880 --> 1:36:25.200]  schools not just a youth corps it's got a
[1:36:25.200 --> 1:36:28.800]  another program here clean energy corps education corps
[1:36:28.800 --> 1:36:32.480]  healthy future corps veterans corps and they're gonna pay them
[1:36:32.480 --> 1:36:35.200]  tax money so it's the federal government is exploding in size they say
[1:36:35.200 --> 1:36:37.680]  you've got to do it but we're going to pay you
[1:36:37.680 --> 1:36:40.720]  and so they're going to be little devilish servants of government to be
[1:36:40.720 --> 1:36:43.680]  part of it i mean this has happened in east germany russia china
[1:36:43.680 --> 1:36:49.840]  nazi germany loving or hating shaves has set this up in venezuela
[1:36:49.840 --> 1:36:54.800]  cuba does it i mean this is classical as bad as it gets the most stinking
[1:36:54.800 --> 1:36:59.440]  tyranny and i wanted to nexus that in with a story from info wars net steve
[1:36:59.440 --> 1:37:03.200]  watson january 30th of this year two months ago defense
[1:37:03.200 --> 1:37:06.320]  department announces civilian expeditionary force
[1:37:06.320 --> 1:37:10.240]  and we've got a link to the bill there and excuse me not bill it nexus is with
[1:37:10.240 --> 1:37:13.520]  the bill to the defense department directive 14 0 4 10
[1:37:13.520 --> 1:37:18.240]  defense department directive 14 0 4 10 management retains the authority to
[1:37:18.240 --> 1:37:22.240]  direct and assign civilian employees either voluntary or involuntary
[1:37:22.240 --> 1:37:25.600]  or on an unexpected basis to accomplish do d missions
[1:37:25.600 --> 1:37:30.000]  domestically or internationally and it says that you will be forced to
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:34.240]  deploy so there you have it exactly what they said
[1:37:34.240 --> 1:37:37.840]  they were going to do decades ago that's now happening
[1:37:37.840 --> 1:37:41.200]  bob Chapman i mean you were in military intelligence you fought in the cold war
[1:37:41.200 --> 1:37:44.400]  you were over in berlin you know before you got into private business
[1:37:44.400 --> 1:37:47.680]  and publishing things like none they're called a conspiracy i mean if people
[1:37:47.680 --> 1:37:52.240]  don't recognize this as the most virulent certified tyranny
[1:37:52.240 --> 1:37:55.200]  can you explain to people historically what this means i mean they're still
[1:37:55.200 --> 1:37:58.560]  calling it a rumor and the bill has passed the house on its way for sure
[1:37:58.560 --> 1:38:02.320]  passage they're saying in the senate
[1:38:02.320 --> 1:38:06.000]  it's the beginning of tyranny is people have read about it
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:09.440]  that occurred in all the places you've mentioned just now
[1:38:09.440 --> 1:38:14.400]  and uh the plans are being put in place how long will it take
[1:38:14.400 --> 1:38:19.280]  i think maybe um i think a year from this summer
[1:38:19.280 --> 1:38:24.560]  and i'll tell you why unemployment will be about 22 percent this year
[1:38:24.560 --> 1:38:29.680]  and by the end of the year and i don't think that's enough to get people
[1:38:29.680 --> 1:38:33.520]  cranked up fully and so i think going into the
[1:38:33.520 --> 1:38:39.120]  following year sometime during 2010 uh the riots and
[1:38:39.120 --> 1:38:43.280]  demonstrations are going to be uh happening in america in a big way i
[1:38:43.280 --> 1:38:47.200]  may be up my timing but things always take a little bit longer than you
[1:38:47.200 --> 1:38:51.040]  think they're going to but their whole movement their whole
[1:38:51.040 --> 1:38:59.120]  plan is moving forward and timeline i i expect real real trouble
[1:38:59.120 --> 1:39:01.760]  next year
[1:39:02.240 --> 1:39:07.040]  can you imagine they're saying a million goons in one of these six cores
[1:39:07.040 --> 1:39:11.520]  alone a million power tripping 20 year olds with guns i mean they're
[1:39:11.520 --> 1:39:14.960]  saying they're going to harm them running around bossing everybody taking
[1:39:14.960 --> 1:39:18.640]  over the cities and counties i mean this is hellish
[1:39:18.640 --> 1:39:23.440]  well if they if they do things that they're not supposed to do
[1:39:23.440 --> 1:39:26.240]  they're going to get killed
[1:39:26.640 --> 1:39:31.200]  it's pretty simple you know there's 40 million x servicemen out there
[1:39:31.200 --> 1:39:35.680]  and and ladies and they all know how to shoot straight
[1:39:35.680 --> 1:39:40.320]  and uh these young people are no match for them
[1:39:40.320 --> 1:39:46.960]  it's as simple as that and uh they're going to get wiped out
[1:39:46.960 --> 1:39:50.960]  i mean even if they threw the military in in the law enforcement in
[1:39:50.960 --> 1:39:54.080]  they might be able to garner three or four million people
[1:39:54.080 --> 1:39:59.360]  against 40 million many who have served in combat no i don't think so
[1:39:59.360 --> 1:40:02.640]  and the way that ammunition is leaving the shelves in the stores
[1:40:02.640 --> 1:40:09.280]  they're obviously polluted for beer well that's my next question for you
[1:40:09.280 --> 1:40:13.600]  folks i would love nothing more than to believe glenn back and rush limbar good
[1:40:13.600 --> 1:40:17.280]  guys but these are the people that said no new world order exist
[1:40:17.280 --> 1:40:22.080]  ron paul supporters are terrorist he was he was following last year only about
[1:40:22.080 --> 1:40:27.760]  13 months ago show after show the federally issued you know my act type
[1:40:27.760 --> 1:40:32.080]  reports and i said he's following a federal demonization script i mean
[1:40:32.080 --> 1:40:35.360]  this is what i do this is all i do folks i know what it is i know what it is when
[1:40:35.360 --> 1:40:38.240]  i see it i see a coral snake on my back porch or
[1:40:38.240 --> 1:40:42.000]  water moccasin i know what it is too okay i see a snapping turtle
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:45.280]  you know a pond i'm about to jump into i don't jump on top the snapping turtle
[1:40:45.280 --> 1:40:49.280]  i know what this is okay and now he comes up i'm your friend i'm fighting the
[1:40:49.280 --> 1:40:52.880]  new world order but i'm not sure if it exists or if forced
[1:40:52.880 --> 1:40:56.960]  service exists and you know i think we do need these my act reports but
[1:40:56.960 --> 1:41:01.120]  it's kind of mean to to say that gun owners are bad too
[1:41:01.120 --> 1:41:04.560]  but you can trust me but by the way al qaeda is about to get us
[1:41:04.560 --> 1:41:08.800]  but the mere fact that limbaugh covered the my act report they're all
[1:41:08.800 --> 1:41:12.080]  covering a week after i covered they covered here and
[1:41:12.080 --> 1:41:14.400]  i've talked to folks in these organizations they admit they're watching
[1:41:14.400 --> 1:41:19.600]  everything we do here um and they're trying to pose as if
[1:41:19.600 --> 1:41:23.200]  they are the voice of the people to get the populations trust
[1:41:23.200 --> 1:41:28.880]  so that a key time like benedict arnold they can stick a knife between our ribs
[1:41:29.680 --> 1:41:33.440]  well that's absolutely correct
[1:41:34.240 --> 1:41:37.760]  but doesn't that signify that we are winning the hearts and minds in a big
[1:41:37.760 --> 1:41:41.360]  way that the guns are being sold out the animals being sold out
[1:41:41.360 --> 1:41:46.320]  that liberty issues are now the hottest thing and growing exponentially
[1:41:46.320 --> 1:41:50.160]  and we got to keep right on doing it and it's not only for americans these
[1:41:50.160 --> 1:41:54.240]  broadcasts go all over the world and we got to let everybody else know out
[1:41:54.240 --> 1:41:58.000]  there that the people who are running your government
[1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:01.680]  are cooperating for the most part with the people who are running ours and the
[1:42:01.680 --> 1:42:06.080]  governments in europe etc and when the time comes you got to
[1:42:06.080 --> 1:42:10.240]  remove them
[1:42:11.520 --> 1:42:14.400]  well it's clear the criminals running the planet are going for broke i mean
[1:42:14.400 --> 1:42:18.080]  they've committed so many crimes and there's so much dirt on them that
[1:42:18.080 --> 1:42:22.400]  they've got to bring in a total tyranny or they're going to jail
[1:42:22.400 --> 1:42:24.960]  at best
[1:42:27.680 --> 1:42:32.480]  most of them are old enough once they get in they'll never get out
[1:42:32.480 --> 1:42:37.040]  well another thing's happening bob even upper echelon
[1:42:37.040 --> 1:42:41.440]  technocrats and functionaries of the elite are speaking out genuinely against
[1:42:41.440 --> 1:42:45.760]  what's happening there's even large sectors of the nuvo riche and the
[1:42:45.760 --> 1:42:50.560]  upper crust of the nuvo riche that are realizing now
[1:42:50.560 --> 1:42:53.680]  oh that they're not going to be protected either that this tyranny
[1:42:53.680 --> 1:42:56.800]  you know might have been fun a few years ago but this is for real this isn't a
[1:42:56.800 --> 1:43:00.080]  game would you like to speak to them
[1:43:00.080 --> 1:43:07.920]  all i can say to you is you have been useful in the climb to the top so to
[1:43:07.920 --> 1:43:11.840]  speak by those who are controlling things
[1:43:11.840 --> 1:43:15.680]  and don't think you'll be protected they will eject you
[1:43:15.680 --> 1:43:22.160]  reject you out of hand it's just like someone who
[1:43:22.160 --> 1:43:30.000]  comes from the other side spies for you and when they go to attack they put
[1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:34.880]  you in the front the same thing all you're doing is uh
[1:43:34.880 --> 1:43:39.920]  going to end up absorbing economic bullets so to speak
[1:43:39.920 --> 1:43:45.920]  and that means that they'll be pointing the figure at you
[1:43:45.920 --> 1:43:50.800]  upper middle class let you take the the lump so to speak
[1:43:50.800 --> 1:43:57.280]  but that only happened for so long and uh once the system breaks down
[1:43:57.280 --> 1:44:00.240]  we're going to get to the people who are doing this and they've been doing it
[1:44:00.240 --> 1:44:02.800]  for centuries and we know who all of them are
[1:44:02.800 --> 1:44:05.440]  well that's a good point i'm not going to get away i mean you know
[1:44:05.440 --> 1:44:10.240]  half the population of the world could die in what we're facing right now
[1:44:10.240 --> 1:44:15.600]  that's a distinct possibility and they're not going to get away
[1:44:17.360 --> 1:44:21.520]  man that's what's amazing about it but you hit on a key point there
[1:44:21.520 --> 1:44:27.120]  that the elite always eat their own and that a lot of people that have been
[1:44:27.120 --> 1:44:35.920]  serving the system knowingly are in for a very very rude awakening
[1:44:35.920 --> 1:44:40.160]  bob Chapman what are a few other brief solutions politically
[1:44:40.160 --> 1:44:42.640]  i mean folks should be spreading the word right now about the new world or
[1:44:42.640 --> 1:44:46.240]  obviously people's minds are open to it now what are some of the other things
[1:44:46.240 --> 1:44:49.040]  folks should be doing right now to try to lessen
[1:44:49.040 --> 1:44:55.200]  this calamity that we're already entering well i don't think this much we
[1:44:55.200 --> 1:44:59.360]  can do about bringing it to a halt
[1:44:59.360 --> 1:45:03.600]  and we can do the things you've talked about also
[1:45:03.600 --> 1:45:07.760]  telling everybody about the federal reserve what it does
[1:45:07.760 --> 1:45:13.360]  and do what a bunch of bad guys they are everybody knows that even though they
[1:45:13.360 --> 1:45:17.760]  voted for these people the people in congress are all paid off except for
[1:45:17.760 --> 1:45:21.840]  perhaps 15 percent and 10 of that 15 percent uh
[1:45:21.840 --> 1:45:28.320]  have private lives that compromise them and you're not going to get anything
[1:45:28.320 --> 1:45:33.440]  done anymore through the system we have two tier courts
[1:45:33.440 --> 1:45:39.920]  and you know you have guys like made off we spend several months in their home
[1:45:39.920 --> 1:45:43.600]  their luxurious home while they're waiting for charges
[1:45:43.600 --> 1:45:47.840]  uh no one is told you yet where all the money went
[1:45:47.840 --> 1:45:52.560]  nobody is told us yet uh who was involved there had to be hundreds of
[1:45:52.560 --> 1:45:56.880]  people involved in this thing you know i've been in finance for 50 years i know
[1:45:56.880 --> 1:46:03.760]  what it takes to do things and so this evolutionary
[1:46:03.760 --> 1:46:07.680]  process is going to go on and on and all of a sudden
[1:46:07.680 --> 1:46:11.120]  the plug will be pulled and i think that's two to three years away
[1:46:11.120 --> 1:46:14.560]  but they got to get a wider war going and i noticed that
[1:46:14.560 --> 1:46:19.120]  they're sending additional troops into afghanistan
[1:46:19.120 --> 1:46:23.920]  it was 40 000 the number i saw yeah first it was going to be 18 then 30 now 40
[1:46:23.920 --> 1:46:28.240]  now obama's saying he may put 80 000 us troops
[1:46:28.240 --> 1:46:32.240]  with other nato and un troops this was the ap headline yesterday
[1:46:32.240 --> 1:46:37.920]  for a total of 400 000 troops in afghanistan by next year
[1:46:37.920 --> 1:46:42.320]  well that means they're going to go invade pakistan and they'll probably
[1:46:42.320 --> 1:46:47.520]  balkanize it based upon tribes and they'll probably go into
[1:46:47.520 --> 1:46:51.600]  bangaladesh and maybe even india uh this is
[1:46:51.600 --> 1:46:55.520]  you know you go back to the writings in the early 80s uh
[1:46:55.520 --> 1:46:58.720]  uh there's a big no brazilian skate and it's all laid out
[1:46:58.720 --> 1:47:02.000]  i mean that's how i found out about it no that's the thing these people all
[1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:04.720]  write books bragging what they're going to do
[1:47:04.720 --> 1:47:09.120]  20 years before he just wrote one last year bragging about all this
[1:47:09.120 --> 1:47:12.640]  we read it to people on air and they still don't believe it bob i
[1:47:12.640 --> 1:47:17.120]  you know i broke the myek report we pushed the story big on the gun
[1:47:17.120 --> 1:47:20.560]  confiscation drills in iowa i still have people claiming all
[1:47:20.560 --> 1:47:24.720]  that's a lie while ap and roiders cover it giving us no
[1:47:24.720 --> 1:47:27.200]  credit for what we broke and i don't even care about that
[1:47:27.200 --> 1:47:33.920]  the issue is i am i am just sick of people living in denial
[1:47:33.920 --> 1:47:37.920]  again half the population is illiterate
[1:47:37.920 --> 1:47:42.160]  and it's their own fault and they're not stupid
[1:47:42.160 --> 1:47:46.400]  they just don't care they just don't care
[1:47:46.400 --> 1:47:49.520]  i agree with you it's like they've had their soul sucked out it's most people
[1:47:49.520 --> 1:47:52.320]  are like in a daze it's like they're half asleep and they're
[1:47:52.320 --> 1:47:55.360]  so self-centered they won't even protect themselves they're just like i'm too
[1:47:55.360 --> 1:47:59.280]  lazy no no there's no corruption i don't have to do
[1:47:59.280 --> 1:48:02.800]  anything then it's because they have no respect for themselves
[1:48:02.800 --> 1:48:05.200]  you know i was thinking about this this morning hit me like a ton of bricks i'm
[1:48:05.200 --> 1:48:09.120]  not some tough guy folks but i was driving
[1:48:09.120 --> 1:48:13.040]  into work i was listening to bbc on xm and they were
[1:48:13.040 --> 1:48:16.560]  talking to people from mass shootings about how the shooters are coming down
[1:48:16.560 --> 1:48:20.880]  the hall killing everybody and the teacher tells them lie down
[1:48:20.880 --> 1:48:24.000]  and they just wait while the guy comes up and shoot them and and and every time
[1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:26.560]  i mention this people email me going oh you're a think you're a tough guy no
[1:48:26.560 --> 1:48:32.560]  folks my survival instinct hasn't been gilded and i can say for a certainty
[1:48:32.560 --> 1:48:36.560]  somebody pulls a gun on me i'm going to go for it because that happened to me in
[1:48:36.560 --> 1:48:40.000]  dallas twice growing up and once with a knife
[1:48:40.000 --> 1:48:43.520]  and then people think oh you're just acting tough no i mean if somebody's
[1:48:43.520 --> 1:48:46.880]  coming down the hall shooting people i'm going to crouch by the door he may shoot
[1:48:46.880 --> 1:48:49.840]  me but i'm going to go after him he's not going to go in the room and kill 20
[1:48:49.840 --> 1:48:53.200]  people in methodically in the class because i'm
[1:48:53.200 --> 1:48:57.600]  i don't have courage bob i am an animal i am vicious
[1:48:57.600 --> 1:49:01.360]  uh you know at a sick level i'd love somebody to try that i want to
[1:49:01.360 --> 1:49:05.680]  literally rip their head off their shoulders and i don't understand
[1:49:05.680 --> 1:49:09.520]  how the time somebody tried to mug me in dallas i feigned like oh my god i'm
[1:49:09.520 --> 1:49:12.560]  scared and started getting down on my knees and grabbed the gun out and
[1:49:12.560 --> 1:49:16.480]  literally stopped that guy's head into into putty and then and then people
[1:49:16.480 --> 1:49:20.000]  think i'm making that up like i made up going to behemian grove or i made up
[1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:24.240]  breaking the mayac reporter i made up you know a founding 9 11 truth or i
[1:49:24.240 --> 1:49:28.640]  made up making the obama deception i'm about action and and the people are so
[1:49:28.640 --> 1:49:31.840]  cowardly bob they think i'm making it up that i've
[1:49:31.840 --> 1:49:35.360]  taken guns away from people i don't understand why people are so
[1:49:35.360 --> 1:49:39.520]  wimpy i don't think of myself as a tough guy bob somebody comes after me i
[1:49:39.520 --> 1:49:44.480]  can't control myself what is wrong with these people
[1:49:44.480 --> 1:49:49.200]  i don't know we've discussed some of it i just don't know
[1:49:49.200 --> 1:49:53.600]  they just continue to do this and the thing that will change it
[1:49:53.600 --> 1:50:01.840]  is an empty belly that's what will make these people act
[1:50:01.840 --> 1:50:04.720]  sounds like a big protest or something's going on there and your undisclosed
[1:50:04.720 --> 1:50:09.280]  third-world country that's right
[1:50:10.480 --> 1:50:15.600]  that's the way they advertise
[1:50:15.600 --> 1:50:19.440]  anyways i was just listening to this guy going and i got down on my belly and i
[1:50:19.440 --> 1:50:23.600]  let him shoot me four times and and everybody was dialing 9-1-1
[1:50:23.600 --> 1:50:27.520]  i mean dial 9-1-1 and die these people raise their daughters their sons
[1:50:27.520 --> 1:50:31.600]  to be cowards and then they send them off into the world not being armed
[1:50:31.600 --> 1:50:35.200]  and then the public's trained to dial 9-1-1 and get on their knees
[1:50:35.200 --> 1:50:40.640]  that's why we've got problems we've been domesticated we've been castrated
[1:50:40.640 --> 1:50:44.400]  folks get past your fear and start really living
[1:50:44.400 --> 1:50:48.000]  i mean i i can't imagine somebody like people in the concentration camps
[1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:51.040]  running into those gullies to be shot they know they're about to die and
[1:50:51.040 --> 1:50:54.560]  they're not attacking the people you're about to die attack bite the guy's
[1:50:54.560 --> 1:50:58.160]  ear off do something get your spirit to fight back

[1:54:27.760 --> 1:54:32.400]  got someone to blame Bob Chapman's our guest right now I wanted to bring Ted
[1:54:32.400 --> 1:54:38.000]  Anderson up because I saw a time magazine article I
[1:54:38.000 --> 1:54:41.840]  have it here in my stack saying that we're delusional and insane
[1:54:41.840 --> 1:54:45.680]  if we want to own gold and that paper is the way to go you can't make this up it
[1:54:45.680 --> 1:54:48.800]  says gold has value only because we believe it has
[1:54:48.800 --> 1:54:53.840]  value it is a collective hallucination that's a quote from is gold
[1:54:53.840 --> 1:54:59.440]  reality the safest investment is called really the safest investment
[1:54:59.440 --> 1:55:03.680]  Bob regardless it is a real industrial metal so is silver
[1:55:03.680 --> 1:55:06.880]  it's outperformed everything it's the only thing performing well right now the
[1:55:06.880 --> 1:55:10.800]  only thing performing well and the establishment is attacking it
[1:55:10.800 --> 1:55:13.760]  with everything they've got and can't hold it down
[1:55:13.760 --> 1:55:17.360]  you're absolutely correct it just shows you how terrified they are
[1:55:17.360 --> 1:55:21.280]  and you know they're in the market every day trying to suppress that silver
[1:55:21.280 --> 1:55:25.520]  and keep the stock market up and again with the stock market they got their
[1:55:25.520 --> 1:55:29.280]  hands full today the market's off 100 points right now
[1:55:29.280 --> 1:55:33.440]  and rightly so with all of the craziness that's going on
[1:55:33.440 --> 1:55:36.560]  with these aluminum is trying to save themselves
[1:55:36.560 --> 1:55:40.400]  and you know gold had two giant days of about
[1:55:40.400 --> 1:55:45.920]  $60 the upside and today it was off 280 or something like that which is
[1:55:45.920 --> 1:55:48.880]  minuscule and we'll probably have a soft day on
[1:55:48.880 --> 1:55:52.720]  Monday but next week it's going higher well let me bring this up it doesn't
[1:55:52.720 --> 1:55:55.920]  matter because Ted Anderson bought gold at $890 and
[1:55:55.920 --> 1:56:00.000]  is passing on the $70 plus dollar savings on the Franks
[1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:05.440]  and on the sovereigns and other coins let's bring Ted Anderson in right now
[1:56:05.440 --> 1:56:09.440]  how good of a deal is that Bob Chapman that he bought into gold
[1:56:09.440 --> 1:56:15.360]  when it was down at $890 and now at now at $970 he's selling it at the
[1:56:15.360 --> 1:56:19.680]  same price when it was low well it's certainly good for the buyers there's no
[1:56:19.680 --> 1:56:23.360]  question about that that's obvious but i gotta say this
[1:56:23.360 --> 1:56:28.400]  and not many people do this Ted it was a stroke of genius
[1:56:28.400 --> 1:56:32.800]  well that's what he always does Ted Anderson yeah i'm right here Alex i
[1:56:32.800 --> 1:56:35.840]  don't know about the stroke of genius because i think any
[1:56:35.840 --> 1:56:40.240]  any dummy could figure out that if that if gold drops right now with what's
[1:56:40.240 --> 1:56:43.760]  going on in washington dc that it's a good time to buy
[1:56:43.760 --> 1:56:47.360]  and that's all i do i just wait for the dips and i buy as much as i can
[1:56:47.360 --> 1:56:50.560]  because you know it's going to happen there's going to be profit taking and
[1:56:50.560 --> 1:56:53.520]  it's going to go up and then it backs off but the trend is up
[1:56:53.520 --> 1:56:56.800]  i mean come on i mean the federal reserve system just stepped in
[1:56:56.800 --> 1:57:00.160]  and they're dropping a trillion dollars on the u.s treasury market what do you
[1:57:00.160 --> 1:57:03.520]  think that's going to do the government is buying its own
[1:57:03.520 --> 1:57:07.680]  debt right now weimar republic type behavior bob still thinks it's a year or
[1:57:07.680 --> 1:57:11.120]  two till total insanity and implosion what do you say Ted
[1:57:11.120 --> 1:57:14.160]  well you know it takes a little bit you know if it takes a little bit of time
[1:57:14.160 --> 1:57:17.520]  for the credit to flow into the prices and yeah indeed we're going to have
[1:57:17.520 --> 1:57:21.600]  inflation within the next year or two i matter of fact i expect to see some of
[1:57:21.600 --> 1:57:24.480]  that coming in already before the end of this year

[2:00:24.720 --> 2:00:28.640]  the simulcast from prisonplanet.tv and t-minus
[2:00:28.640 --> 2:00:32.320]  seven minutes 30 seconds we come into the next segment
[2:00:32.320 --> 2:00:36.320]  for prisonplanet.tv viewers i wanted to finish up with bob Chapman
[2:00:36.320 --> 2:00:43.200]  and ted anderson uh unprecedented to have a trillion 200 million dollars
[2:00:43.200 --> 2:00:49.120]  a private federal reserve but using us taxpayer backed i guess
[2:00:49.120 --> 2:00:53.040]  fiat to go in and buy treasury notes that means
[2:00:53.040 --> 2:00:55.920]  well we've already heard from china and europe and others in russia they're
[2:00:55.920 --> 2:00:59.680]  venezuela they're all backing away from the dollar backing away from us
[2:00:59.680 --> 2:01:02.560]  securities i mean this could this could get out of
[2:01:02.560 --> 2:01:05.360]  hand anytime i hope bob's right we've got a few years
[2:01:05.360 --> 2:01:09.280]  to to get ready for this because the elite's doing it one way or the other
[2:01:09.280 --> 2:01:14.640]  uh ted i mean when you found out of but 48 hours ago that they'd done this uh
[2:01:14.640 --> 2:01:18.160]  he told me you got pretty upset because i mean this is a big
[2:01:18.160 --> 2:01:22.960]  financial move here this signifies they are planning total hyperinflation
[2:01:22.960 --> 2:01:26.400]  that's exactly what they're planning alex when the united states
[2:01:26.400 --> 2:01:29.920]  when the federal reserve system which isn't government goes in and buys us
[2:01:29.920 --> 2:01:34.000]  treasuries they're buying now those treasuries from absolutely nothing
[2:01:34.000 --> 2:01:37.280]  there's no value of what they're buying it with they are taking
[2:01:37.280 --> 2:01:41.120]  and printing new money and injecting it into the system
[2:01:41.120 --> 2:01:45.280]  and driving down the value of what we already have injecting it into themselves
[2:01:45.280 --> 2:01:48.480]  they're hoarding it they're actually clamping down on credit injecting it
[2:01:48.480 --> 2:01:51.920]  into the u.s government treasury and the u.s treasuries of course
[2:01:51.920 --> 2:01:55.120]  to in me they're making promises to everybody in the world i mean not
[2:01:55.120 --> 2:01:58.720]  only just people the united states you're right i mean it's just the
[2:01:58.720 --> 2:02:02.560]  absolute craziness that that you would never expect from the united
[2:02:02.560 --> 2:02:05.600]  states government that is exactly what's happening right now
[2:02:05.600 --> 2:02:10.000]  well it's very go ahead i was just about to say bob said one thing
[2:02:10.000 --> 2:02:14.080]  earlier that was probably the most the key factor this whole thing we need to
[2:02:14.080 --> 2:02:17.600]  continue to expose the federal reserve system this cannot be
[2:02:17.600 --> 2:02:20.880]  yeah they need to be going to jail instead of posing as our saviors
[2:02:20.880 --> 2:02:23.600]  going to the next level the ponzi scheme a world banking system that's my
[2:02:23.600 --> 2:02:26.080]  final question briefly for you bob Chapman
[2:02:26.080 --> 2:02:29.600]  i mean you know they engineered the economic collapse they badmouthed
[2:02:29.600 --> 2:02:32.880]  the stock market to drive it down for consolidation
[2:02:32.880 --> 2:02:35.840]  now they're terrorizing the public saying accept the new bank of the world
[2:02:35.840 --> 2:02:42.080]  or its curtains but the plan for the bank of the world is to implode things
[2:02:42.080 --> 2:02:46.320]  yes when they're ready and obviously they're not there yet
[2:02:46.320 --> 2:02:50.080]  and you're saying that they have the whole world in flames at the same time
[2:02:50.080 --> 2:02:52.960]  and then they think they'll be able to get away with it but you know we're
[2:02:52.960 --> 2:02:57.360]  going to we know what they're going to do and we're just going to stop them
[2:02:57.360 --> 2:03:01.520]  yeah i mean they've certainly miscalculated the amount of resistance in
[2:03:01.520 --> 2:03:04.800]  the alternative media now spilling into the mainstream media
[2:03:04.800 --> 2:03:07.680]  now i think we've got a good shot at bringing these people to justice but we
[2:03:07.680 --> 2:03:12.720]  better we better not hope we better take action

[2:11:20.560 --> 2:11:24.400]  way towards doing that and she's here in austin texas

[2:11:39.440 --> 2:11:43.840]  in uh los angeles there was actually fullerton there was a tea party
[2:11:43.840 --> 2:11:48.320]  and 15 000 people came out to uh protest the tax increases
[2:11:48.320 --> 2:11:51.680]  and a lot of those people 15 000 people
[2:11:51.680 --> 2:11:55.440]  shut down the streets last couple weeks ago had campaign for liberty
[2:11:55.440 --> 2:11:59.760]  ron paul should have been president signs i mean the campaign for liberty had a
[2:11:59.760 --> 2:12:03.440]  um passing all kinds of material and it's still
[2:12:03.440 --> 2:12:06.720]  we haven't given up the fight it's still going and folks from the campaign
[2:12:06.720 --> 2:12:10.560]  like oath keepers have spun off and are getting tens of thousands of police and
[2:12:10.560 --> 2:12:14.560]  military to you know go public and say i'm not going to violate my oath i'm
[2:12:14.560 --> 2:12:17.520]  not going to confiscate guns i'm not going to put people in fema
[2:12:17.520 --> 2:12:21.280]  camps i'm not going to go along with the military commission's act to grab
[2:12:21.280 --> 2:12:24.800]  american citizens there is a huge awakening we have police sending us
[2:12:24.800 --> 2:12:28.400]  all these internal documents where they're trying to covertly demonize us
[2:12:28.400 --> 2:12:31.600]  showing that the establishment is scared of the american people
[2:12:31.600 --> 2:12:35.360]  and knows that we have a chance of bringing the international crime syndicate
[2:12:35.360 --> 2:12:39.040]  to justice now tell folks how you woke up to liberty a little bit about yourself
[2:12:39.040 --> 2:12:43.760]  and then uh jason bermas had you in a few nights ago
[2:12:43.760 --> 2:12:47.920]  on the info warrior show that he does from nine to midnight over the same studio
[2:12:47.920 --> 2:12:52.000]  and i didn't know about this you know that right after you're on my show
[2:12:52.000 --> 2:12:54.880]  it looks like this is happening to me but they've been punching me and telling me
[2:12:54.880 --> 2:12:58.000]  shut up you know don't have a but uh beating with a crowbar
[2:12:58.000 --> 2:13:02.240]  and then not stealing anything uh it was is very bizarre it was very bizarre it
[2:13:02.240 --> 2:13:06.720]  was a three three people i mean there's three of us and uh they pushed
[2:13:06.720 --> 2:13:10.720]  one of my they pushed my friend out of the way to target me and there was two
[2:13:10.720 --> 2:13:14.000]  guys beating my head and face and that's it just my
[2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:18.080]  mouth broke my jaw and uh beat me with a crowbar
[2:13:18.080 --> 2:13:21.360]  uh and i left my friend you still look extremely lovely thank you the same as
[2:13:21.360 --> 2:13:24.320]  you did before um but yeah it was last summer but uh they uh
[2:13:24.320 --> 2:13:27.360]  thank you they uh but they they dumped out all of our
[2:13:27.360 --> 2:13:30.640]  purses i was with two waitresses so they had tons of cash i had tons of cash
[2:13:30.640 --> 2:13:33.360]  they dumped out of purses telling them to take our money
[2:13:33.360 --> 2:13:37.440]  and they kicked it they kicked the money and laughed and walked away and i thought
[2:13:37.440 --> 2:13:41.200]  that's what it's important how they were dressed what they look like
[2:13:41.200 --> 2:13:47.760]  um they were you know i i think i think they were i don't know they were um
[2:13:47.760 --> 2:13:52.480]  you know mexican gang members probably most likely so it was either the
[2:13:52.480 --> 2:13:55.280]  government or somebody hired them or it was a gang initiation
[2:13:55.280 --> 2:13:59.280]  correct but it was bizarre that i was the only one
[2:13:59.280 --> 2:14:03.440]  that they hit they didn't touch well in LA it's on record congressional testimony
[2:14:03.440 --> 2:14:07.440]  the big gangs worked for the CIA well they the police told me they're probably
[2:14:07.440 --> 2:14:10.400]  illegal aliens so we're not even gonna pursue it you know we're not they're
[2:14:10.400 --> 2:14:13.280]  probably not on record anywhere yeah that's how it is they're just invincible
[2:14:13.280 --> 2:14:18.240]  they're the fake IDs just do whatever they want so uh they were
[2:14:18.240 --> 2:14:21.920]  beating with a crowbar yeah i almost died my brain i have
[2:14:21.920 --> 2:14:26.720]  mass i have some uh memory loss but
[2:14:26.720 --> 2:14:30.320]  we need to start carrying a heater right i do
[2:14:30.320 --> 2:14:35.360]  i do no i mean it's our segment right and so that's what we do
[2:14:35.360 --> 2:14:40.080]  and uh i mean it's important to do yeah and i need to
[2:14:40.080 --> 2:14:43.760]  i have a taser right now that's good yeah it's illegal in most states and it's
[2:14:43.760 --> 2:14:47.120]  really powerful so uh by the way the people always try to when i say that
[2:14:47.120 --> 2:14:50.320]  they go well you're a hypocrite you're against tasers no i'm against police
[2:14:50.320 --> 2:14:54.320]  using them when somebody just argues with them or don't tase me bro i'm not
[2:14:54.320 --> 2:14:57.840]  against guns or tasers themselves i'm against their misuse
[2:14:57.840 --> 2:15:00.960]  and i think my taser is more powerful than police tasers
[2:15:00.960 --> 2:15:03.760]  so it's a very very powerful i know they will recently come out with even more
[2:15:03.760 --> 2:15:06.560]  high-powered taser from taser international it's amazing yeah i've
[2:15:06.560 --> 2:15:10.560]  got a great one how many volts or watts is it i forget
[2:15:10.560 --> 2:15:13.120]  but i know that it's illegal in most states which which means it's pretty
[2:15:13.120 --> 2:15:16.560]  powerful i'm very excited about that although i think it's legal in texas
[2:15:16.560 --> 2:15:21.280]  yeah well you almost died so um you know we need to get past our fear of guns
[2:15:21.280 --> 2:15:26.400]  but properly and i'll learn how to use them uh i mean that's so important to
[2:15:26.400 --> 2:15:31.680]  do so we can protect ourselves yeah absolutely i mean you know we've gone
[2:15:31.680 --> 2:15:33.920]  from a culture that understood the second amendment
[2:15:33.920 --> 2:15:38.400]  to a culture that is afraid of it and and that's the biggest fight they're
[2:15:38.400 --> 2:15:42.000]  trying to create the illusion uh that you know it's a bad thing we have to
[2:15:42.000 --> 2:15:47.120]  take the moral high ground back yeah so they were targeting you specifically
[2:15:47.120 --> 2:15:50.160]  targeting me specifically and who knows why maybe
[2:15:50.160 --> 2:15:53.920]  it just uh decided i was their target or
[2:15:53.920 --> 2:15:57.280]  it just was it was weird because it was a couple days after i spoke about the
[2:15:57.280 --> 2:16:01.760]  cia on the show and uh try the cia went in
[2:16:01.760 --> 2:16:04.880]  and because you know you've had uh you know music on the charts you've had
[2:16:04.880 --> 2:16:09.360]  stuff on mtv correct and uh they're really scared of that you know
[2:16:09.360 --> 2:16:12.880]  kind of anthem uh that could really damage them and so tell
[2:16:12.880 --> 2:16:17.120]  folks the cia story the first cia story oh the well the first cia story is that
[2:16:17.120 --> 2:16:22.320]  cia it was right after 9-11 and they called my label and said to um
[2:16:22.320 --> 2:16:25.600]  remove any reference to starting a revolution on my website
[2:16:25.600 --> 2:16:30.480]  so that's the first cia story the uh the second cia story is um
[2:16:30.480 --> 2:16:34.880]  i have befriended a cia agent uh who has high security
[2:16:34.880 --> 2:16:38.400]  clearance and um he told me specifically that
[2:16:38.400 --> 2:16:43.840]  they're not allowed to visit uh info wars dot com prison planet uh
[2:16:43.840 --> 2:16:47.360]  because they could get fired and so any information they don't even trust them
[2:16:47.360 --> 2:16:50.000]  with their own minds they could get fired for
[2:16:50.000 --> 2:16:53.360]  for even looking at because it's the truth uh now you met this guy on an
[2:16:53.360 --> 2:16:56.080]  airplane you've you know gotten to know him and uh
[2:16:56.080 --> 2:17:00.640]  so what's he say about 9-11 truth um he said that he is
[2:17:00.640 --> 2:17:04.320]  hasn't told uh his wife or his friends or anyone
[2:17:04.320 --> 2:17:08.400]  um about what he knows about it or what and what he thinks about it
[2:17:08.400 --> 2:17:12.560]  um out of fear for his job well we've had bill christensen who was a cia
[2:17:12.560 --> 2:17:15.280]  section chief over berlin one of the most important one saying
[2:17:15.280 --> 2:17:18.320]  total inside job we've had the victims family
[2:17:18.320 --> 2:17:22.000]  groups on the largest groups uh mr doil another saying the majority of the
[2:17:22.000 --> 2:17:25.760]  families believe it's an inside job and we've had uh you know former top cia
[2:17:25.760 --> 2:17:27.520]  briefer to ronald reagan george bush senior
[2:17:27.520 --> 2:17:30.320]  ran the government saying all the evidence points towards inside job and
[2:17:30.320 --> 2:17:34.480]  then uh mr bearer uh that the uh film seriana's about uh we seem getting
[2:17:34.480 --> 2:17:37.760]  tortured all that's true story and him out committing assassinations he says
[2:17:37.760 --> 2:17:41.600]  all the evidence points towards inside job he's so so i mean
[2:17:41.600 --> 2:17:45.200]  again it's so compartmentalized even within their own structure and they're
[2:17:45.200 --> 2:17:48.560]  not allowed to talk about it they're not allowed to talk about it so it is a
[2:17:48.560 --> 2:17:52.880]  good sign that secretly at least that they're on our side you know
[2:17:52.880 --> 2:17:56.080]  well some of them are now some of them are some of them some of them are just
[2:17:56.080 --> 2:17:58.880]  psychopathic criminals or they're foreign contractors
[2:17:58.880 --> 2:18:02.720]  and and and the cia is just kind of a catchall for the right 30 plus
[2:18:02.720 --> 2:18:06.480]  intelligence agencies of 15 big ones and then uh they've got so many
[2:18:06.480 --> 2:18:10.080]  private contractors out doing stuff right you know they find people in
[2:18:10.080 --> 2:18:13.440]  special forces that are psychos like to kill and give them all these missions
[2:18:13.440 --> 2:18:16.320]  killing whole villages and stuff and they just bring them back home
[2:18:16.320 --> 2:18:20.400]  yeah right so you'd never talked about that until you came on the show here
[2:18:20.400 --> 2:18:23.360]  about the cia contacting your label for those that don't know i don't know about
[2:18:23.360 --> 2:18:27.040]  your particular case i believe it it was in mainstream news that
[2:18:27.040 --> 2:18:31.600]  white house and cia contact hollywood no anti-government messages get behind the
[2:18:31.600 --> 2:18:35.360]  you know the the country we've been attacked right and so we know they do
[2:18:35.360 --> 2:18:37.760]  that and now they're going to spend 40 something billion a year the pentagon
[2:18:37.760 --> 2:18:41.040]  alone on its image and so you see all these rock bands
[2:18:41.040 --> 2:18:44.960]  you know uh kid rocks not being attacked or three doors downs not being

[2:25:04.160 --> 2:25:12.640]  messages in it but uh but it is for the people it's for people who
[2:25:12.640 --> 2:25:18.720]  you know need to calm down and that's relaxing that's relaxing
[2:25:18.720 --> 2:25:22.080]  because i needed a healing record after my soul i needed to record something
[2:25:22.080 --> 2:25:26.080]  that wasn't loud distorted uh synthetic over produced
[2:25:26.080 --> 2:25:30.000]  i just needed to do a very simple simple or any of these up on the web yet we
[2:25:30.000 --> 2:25:32.640]  can play them i don't think we're fancy enough to have a cd player in the
[2:25:32.640 --> 2:25:36.320]  studio uh okay good so we are going to have some of
[2:25:36.320 --> 2:25:39.120]  that coming up that's good we're coming out of the break with one then
[2:25:39.120 --> 2:25:44.960]  fantastic uh so so you grew up in the west family that was aware of the
[2:25:44.960 --> 2:25:48.400]  globalist agenda i mean did you believe your family when they
[2:25:48.400 --> 2:25:50.240]  were warning you when your mother was warning you about all the stuff that
[2:25:50.240 --> 2:25:54.160]  was coming um not not so much uh in the beginning but she was
[2:25:54.160 --> 2:25:59.360]  stockpiling food making her own bread uh you know she's making her own food
[2:25:59.360 --> 2:26:02.720]  she was i mean she was absolutely she just kind of
[2:26:02.720 --> 2:26:04.960]  banged it in my head my whole life well that's a good
[2:26:04.960 --> 2:26:07.520]  interesting because they had their whole mechanism in place to bring in
[2:26:07.520 --> 2:26:11.360]  martial law then but we knew that back when i started
[2:26:11.360 --> 2:26:13.760]  14 years ago that they weren't going to launch it right at that point because
[2:26:13.760 --> 2:26:17.520]  they hadn't propagandized enough yet and that they had to announce it
[2:26:17.520 --> 2:26:20.720]  first that that would herald their move now they're announcing it does that
[2:26:20.720 --> 2:26:24.720]  concern you it's absolutely amazing it's happened in a
[2:26:24.720 --> 2:26:28.400]  in such a short period of time that's what's astounding it's it's it's
[2:26:28.400 --> 2:26:34.000]  happening very rapidly at this point the new world order for told for so long
[2:26:34.000 --> 2:26:37.200]  because the old timers actually had the government documents now is
[2:26:37.200 --> 2:26:41.120]  upon us yeah you know i talk a lot about a a quickening
[2:26:41.120 --> 2:26:44.560]  or an awakening happening that's much bigger than what we saw last year with
[2:26:44.560 --> 2:26:48.720]  ron paul being the focal point uh are you seeing that same awakening out there
[2:26:48.720 --> 2:26:52.960]  yeah it's it's really refreshing and to see it on aol i mean the cover of aol
[2:26:52.960 --> 2:26:57.440]  to talk about the build of our group uh at 70 percent i watched i read the poll
[2:26:57.440 --> 2:27:01.200]  and it said 70 percent uh 26 000 people took the poll and
[2:27:01.200 --> 2:27:04.000]  70 percent didn't had never heard of the build of our group so
[2:27:04.000 --> 2:27:08.560]  that's very uh very encouraging and and the majority
[2:27:08.560 --> 2:27:11.440]  harassed they liked it and they said that they thought it was a bad thing right
[2:27:11.440 --> 2:27:15.520]  so i guess they need to be arrested as terrorists because the federally written
[2:27:15.520 --> 2:27:20.000]  reports distributed by the states um
[2:27:20.000 --> 2:27:23.200]  they're out running around saying if you put a ron paul bumper sticker on her
[2:27:23.200 --> 2:27:26.720]  believe in a builder bar group or a new world order you're a dangerous person
[2:27:26.720 --> 2:27:29.360]  yeah i don't i don't know i mean we're all terrorists
[2:27:29.360 --> 2:27:34.000]  for you know it's it's it's not to germany it just with a different uh
[2:27:34.000 --> 2:27:37.920]  different clothes well expanding on that uh when this broke last week when we
[2:27:37.920 --> 2:27:43.120]  broke it i had remembered a texas flyer i've been so busy i knew we posted it on
[2:27:43.120 --> 2:27:46.080]  info wars dot com i hadn't even google searched it i just said
[2:27:46.080 --> 2:27:50.000]  hey alabama texas it's come out i finally did print some of those last
[2:27:50.000 --> 2:27:52.480]  nine then jim marz who's in here in about 30 minutes
[2:27:52.480 --> 2:27:55.280]  i opened the door during the break and he goes well you were there he goes look
[2:27:55.280 --> 2:28:00.000]  alex you don't forget the texas one it says the same thing the missouri one says
[2:28:00.000 --> 2:28:02.960]  and i'm like oh there it is we're gonna scan that back in
[2:28:02.960 --> 2:28:06.800]  and show that coming up so there was jim you know with another one these are
[2:28:06.800 --> 2:28:09.760]  everywhere yeah and uh it says the same thing this one says
[2:28:09.760 --> 2:28:13.200]  these are nice people that work at soup kitchens and say they're involved in
[2:28:13.200 --> 2:28:16.720]  government and that they want less government but they're secretly cell
[2:28:16.720 --> 2:28:21.040]  group terrorist this one says it and the texas one says it from four years ago
[2:28:21.040 --> 2:28:24.400]  and the christians i mean if you're a christian and you uh
[2:28:24.400 --> 2:28:27.280]  leaving you know freedom you're a terrorist yeah but if you're one of
[2:28:27.280 --> 2:28:31.200]  these obama worshiping or bush worshiping ones then then it's good
[2:28:31.200 --> 2:28:35.200]  yeah it's terrifying what are you most concerned about these days you know the
[2:28:35.200 --> 2:28:38.800]  house just passed the force national compulsory service
[2:28:38.800 --> 2:28:41.840]  it's going to the senate and it says you'll have to serve in the military
[2:28:41.840 --> 2:28:44.640]  domestically or foreign how does that sound
[2:28:44.640 --> 2:28:48.080]  uh i don't i don't know uh you know it's crazy
[2:28:48.080 --> 2:28:52.160]  it's crazy but i'm i'm a little concerned about our tax dollars going to
[2:28:52.160 --> 2:28:56.240]  bail out foreign banks that's kind of upsetting me lately
[2:28:56.240 --> 2:28:59.600]  yeah and it's not seem to it doesn't seem to be upsetting the country
[2:28:59.600 --> 2:29:02.720]  everyone's just sort of taking it like oh okay this is what we're doing now well
[2:29:02.720 --> 2:29:05.360]  the mainstream media keeps chattering like everything's happy
[2:29:05.360 --> 2:29:09.840]  it's kind of like bagdad bob remember the information spokesman for
[2:29:09.840 --> 2:29:14.560]  the iraqi military in 2003 and the tanks are lit there's explosions going off
[2:29:14.560 --> 2:29:18.080]  two miles behind him there's jets flying by bombing and he's going the
[2:29:18.080 --> 2:29:21.760]  americans are 200 miles away we have defeated them we have routed them
[2:29:21.760 --> 2:29:24.640]  and and so that's what the establishment does is they're like everything's fine
[2:29:24.640 --> 2:29:27.760]  everyone loves government everyone's happy with what's happening right and
[2:29:27.760 --> 2:29:31.040]  if you believe the government might be corrupt you are secretly a terrorist
[2:29:31.040 --> 2:29:33.360]  that wants to kill men women and children right
[2:29:33.360 --> 2:29:37.920]  we're going to take some calls for Amy Allen right now opening the phones up

[2:30:27.520 --> 2:30:30.640]  after a crime is better than defending yourself and preventing the crime
[2:30:30.640 --> 2:30:34.640]  don't call e-foods direct if you believe the official report on 9 11
[2:30:34.640 --> 2:30:38.160]  you won't need food if you think the warnings on the alex jones show are

[2:31:38.080 --> 2:31:41.680]  it's not about left or right it's about a one-world government

[2:33:27.760 --> 2:33:37.280]  so
[2:33:47.920 --> 2:33:50.720]  finally
[2:33:50.720 --> 2:34:20.240]  That's a little bit of a change in weather.
[2:34:20.240 --> 2:34:27.240]  So this is really a spiritual album too, isn't it?
[2:34:27.240 --> 2:34:28.240]  Yeah.
[2:34:28.240 --> 2:34:32.960]  There's a lot of, it's a spiritual, I talk about God a lot on the album, and I talk a
[2:34:32.960 --> 2:34:38.440]  lot about, it's social commentary, and I think it's beautiful, hopefully it'll make
[2:34:38.440 --> 2:34:39.440]  people happy.
[2:34:39.440 --> 2:34:43.240]  And what my plan is to do a tea party tour with the album.
[2:34:43.240 --> 2:34:48.600]  It's a lot of reggae, and I feel like reggae makes people, and they're having tea party
[2:34:48.600 --> 2:34:54.520]  rallies all over the country, left, right, coming together saying no more taxation without
[2:34:54.520 --> 2:34:55.520]  representation.
[2:34:55.520 --> 2:34:59.680]  If it isn't taxation without representation, where the Federal Reserve's giving total power
[2:34:59.680 --> 2:35:02.960]  to just print trillions of dollars and give it to themselves while cutting off credit
[2:35:02.960 --> 2:35:07.280]  to the people, if that isn't it, I don't know what is, but finish your point about reggae.
[2:35:07.280 --> 2:35:13.600]  Well, you know, by Marley, you know, his reggae music revolutionized the political system
[2:35:13.600 --> 2:35:14.600]  in Jamaica.
[2:35:14.600 --> 2:35:21.880]  I feel that reggae, I don't need to be screaming through rock songs to get a message across.
[2:35:21.880 --> 2:35:27.760]  I feel that reggae has a way of making people happy and brings people together in a loving
[2:35:27.760 --> 2:35:28.760]  way.
[2:35:28.760 --> 2:35:36.280]  And I would love to have a tea party tour where we hit every city and we give freedom, liberty-loving
[2:35:36.280 --> 2:35:42.280]  individuals a place to come and find other people, like-minded people, so that's the
[2:35:42.280 --> 2:35:43.280]  goal.
[2:35:43.280 --> 2:35:46.600]  Well, you're doing a super good job, evidenced by being physically attacked.
[2:35:46.600 --> 2:35:48.680]  I think that thing stinks to high heaven.
[2:35:48.680 --> 2:35:51.640]  How long did that knock you out of commission when they almost killed you?
[2:35:51.640 --> 2:35:54.880]  A very long time, a couple months.
[2:35:54.880 --> 2:35:59.360]  And I barely, it was funny because the campaign for liberty sent out a press release that
[2:35:59.360 --> 2:36:05.320]  I was performing at the Raleigh for the Republic, and at that point I couldn't open my mouth
[2:36:05.320 --> 2:36:10.160]  at all, and they sent out the press release and I thought, oh no, and then they called
[2:36:10.160 --> 2:36:13.200]  me the next day and said, we're so sorry that we sent that press release.
[2:36:13.200 --> 2:36:14.200]  Will you do it?
[2:36:14.200 --> 2:36:15.200]  You know?
[2:36:15.200 --> 2:36:16.200]  Will you perform?
[2:36:16.200 --> 2:36:20.680]  And I barely opened my mouth, I was like, okay, I'll do it, you know?
[2:36:20.680 --> 2:36:22.360]  Because they broke in your job.
[2:36:22.360 --> 2:36:23.360]  They broke in your job.
[2:36:23.360 --> 2:36:26.440]  Right, with just having enough faith knowing, you know what, I'm just going to say that
[2:36:26.440 --> 2:36:30.360]  I'll do it, and hopefully by the time it comes, it rolls around, I'll be able to open my mouth.
[2:36:30.360 --> 2:36:35.480]  And literally a few days, a week before the Raleigh for the Republic, I actually could
[2:36:35.480 --> 2:36:36.720]  open my mouth enough to sing.
[2:36:36.720 --> 2:36:40.240]  So it was really amazing, just in the nick of time.
[2:36:40.240 --> 2:36:41.240]  So, yeah.
[2:36:41.240 --> 2:36:44.080]  Well, the Lord works in mysterious ways.
[2:36:44.080 --> 2:36:45.580]  Absolutely.
[2:36:45.580 --> 2:36:48.920]  I want to go to some phone calls now, but before we do that, any other points you want
[2:36:48.920 --> 2:36:51.720]  to add about the album or Southwest or what you're doing?
[2:36:51.720 --> 2:36:55.680]  Well, it's my first time at South by Southwest, and I love it.
[2:36:55.680 --> 2:36:59.880]  I wouldn't mind moving here, and especially if Texas secedes from the Union, I'll be the
[2:36:59.880 --> 2:37:00.880]  first in line.
[2:37:00.880 --> 2:37:02.760]  And with our new president, Chuck Norris.
[2:37:02.760 --> 2:37:04.760]  I'm down, definitely.
[2:37:04.760 --> 2:37:05.760]  I'm into it.
[2:37:05.760 --> 2:37:06.760]  Love it.
[2:37:06.760 --> 2:37:07.760]  Love Austin, and I love South by Southwest.
[2:37:07.760 --> 2:37:10.120]  The Vice President will be Jim Mars.
[2:37:10.120 --> 2:37:12.480]  Yeah, let's do it.
[2:37:12.480 --> 2:37:14.480]  Oh, my God.
[2:37:14.480 --> 2:37:15.480]  I really hope.
[2:37:15.480 --> 2:37:19.080]  You know, some say it's just a dream, but I truly hope it happens.
[2:37:19.080 --> 2:37:20.580]  What do you think?
[2:37:20.580 --> 2:37:23.480]  Do you think it's even possibility?
[2:37:23.480 --> 2:37:25.200]  You know, anything can happen in history.
[2:37:25.200 --> 2:37:29.720]  I would rather take our entire country back and not allow them to balkanize us, because
[2:37:29.720 --> 2:37:32.080]  that's actually in their cards.
[2:37:32.080 --> 2:37:37.160]  But if the new order just continues to totally destroy the Republic, we'll have to take the
[2:37:37.160 --> 2:37:40.960]  states back piece by piece, and then decide if we want to reconvene the Union.
[2:37:40.960 --> 2:37:43.640]  And that's the power of the states under the Ninth and Tenth Amendment, the Declaration
[2:37:43.640 --> 2:37:45.240]  of Independence Constitution.
[2:37:45.240 --> 2:37:50.560]  And so we don't have a choice, and we have to believe that things like that can happen,
[2:37:50.560 --> 2:37:53.840]  and that we have power and can effect change, because history shows that.
[2:37:53.840 --> 2:37:55.960]  That's why the establishment is so scared of us.
[2:37:55.960 --> 2:37:56.960]  Right.
[2:37:56.960 --> 2:37:57.960]  It keeps pushing.
[2:37:57.960 --> 2:37:58.960]  Absolutely.
[2:37:58.960 --> 2:38:00.720]  Let's go to calls here.
[2:38:00.720 --> 2:38:04.360]  Let's talk to Billy in New Jersey, you're on the air with Amy Allen.
[2:38:04.360 --> 2:38:06.360]  Hello, Amy.
[2:38:06.360 --> 2:38:07.360]  Hi.
[2:38:07.360 --> 2:38:11.080]  I'm a huge fan of your work, and it's such an honor to speak with you.
[2:38:11.080 --> 2:38:12.080]  Well, thank you.
[2:38:12.080 --> 2:38:16.400]  I'm a songwriter myself, and I have a couple questions, but I want to ask you how you broke
[2:38:16.400 --> 2:38:18.960]  into the industry, and how it is expressing yourself.
[2:38:18.960 --> 2:38:23.160]  Do you find that the music industry is as confined, and that the government tries to
[2:38:23.160 --> 2:38:29.000]  control it as much as they try to control the movie industry?
[2:38:29.000 --> 2:38:31.440]  Right now, I've decided to take the independent route.
[2:38:31.440 --> 2:38:37.320]  So I have an independent record label, a sidetrack records, and we're going through
[2:38:37.320 --> 2:38:45.880]  ADA, which is Warner, but with major distribution, but they have no creative control whatsoever
[2:38:45.880 --> 2:38:46.880]  on what I do.
[2:38:46.880 --> 2:38:53.000]  And I feel like that is the route that real artists need to look into, is to not sign
[2:38:53.000 --> 2:38:58.640]  the major label, but to have an independent label and have their own control over their
[2:38:58.640 --> 2:39:03.680]  own destinies, because if you sign to a major, it will tell you what you can sing and what
[2:39:03.680 --> 2:39:04.680]  you cannot sing.
[2:39:04.680 --> 2:39:05.680]  Oh, yeah.
[2:39:05.680 --> 2:39:11.400]  I've been approached by Universal and people with my films, and I said, no, because, you
[2:39:11.400 --> 2:39:15.240]  know, you take Jesse Ventura, they gave him a $3 million a year contract for three years,
[2:39:15.240 --> 2:39:21.000]  $9 million, and with MSNBC, and then he wasn't thinking as soon as he went in, they said,
[2:39:21.000 --> 2:39:24.360]  basically, you're not going to cover anything you want, no anti-war.
[2:39:24.360 --> 2:39:28.720]  They had hired him right at the start of the war just to muzzle him, so he left with the
[2:39:28.720 --> 2:39:30.280]  money and went and surfed.
[2:39:30.280 --> 2:39:32.040]  And then now he's back because he can speak.
[2:39:32.040 --> 2:39:35.360]  The contract said he couldn't do any media interviews, couldn't write books.
[2:39:35.360 --> 2:39:36.360]  Selling your soul.
[2:39:36.360 --> 2:39:37.360]  Yeah.
[2:39:37.360 --> 2:39:42.480]  And literally, but he got his soul back and came, went public here on the air with 9-11
[2:39:42.480 --> 2:39:43.480]  Truth.
[2:39:43.480 --> 2:39:44.480]  That's great.
[2:39:44.480 --> 2:39:45.480]  Millie, anything else?
[2:39:45.480 --> 2:39:46.480]  Yeah.
[2:39:46.480 --> 2:39:50.720]  Just one last question, and I want to plug a charity, but what advice do you have to
[2:39:50.720 --> 2:39:55.000]  like, you broke into the mainstream, so people knew your name, so I mean, you could sell
[2:39:55.000 --> 2:39:58.720]  like the alternative music, so you're like, I haven't broken in yet, so what advice would
[2:39:58.720 --> 2:40:03.000]  you have for me to try to break it into the mainstream and then go independent or try
[2:40:03.000 --> 2:40:07.160]  to go independent and then just like promote myself as much as possible, like what would
[2:40:07.160 --> 2:40:08.160]  you say?
[2:40:08.160 --> 2:40:13.400]  Well, if you go into a major, what they do is they hold you up for many, many, many,
[2:40:13.400 --> 2:40:14.640]  many years like they do to me.
[2:40:14.640 --> 2:40:16.720]  They don't let you record with anyone else.
[2:40:16.720 --> 2:40:18.560]  They don't let you release your music.
[2:40:18.560 --> 2:40:20.920]  They don't, you're not free to do that.
[2:40:20.920 --> 2:40:24.280]  So it takes years and years and years to get out of the slavery of that situation.
[2:40:24.280 --> 2:40:25.280]  Yeah.
[2:40:25.280 --> 2:40:28.920]  Put your music out for free on the Internet, and if it's good, you will have success.
[2:40:28.920 --> 2:40:32.240]  So many people want, I'm not saying you're saying this, but they want instant success.
[2:40:32.240 --> 2:40:36.360]  I mean, I've worked for free in radio the first few years, then I got $200 a week, then
[2:40:36.360 --> 2:40:40.720]  I got $400 a week, and then I started my own films and things, but the first few years,
[2:40:40.720 --> 2:40:47.040]  I literally had to go have other jobs, working at an auto parts store or whatever.
[2:40:47.040 --> 2:40:52.200]  Then I hire these college kids and people, young adults, and they should be full grown
[2:40:52.200 --> 2:40:57.040]  adults at 20-something, but they have this sense of entitlement, and this sense, and
[2:40:57.040 --> 2:41:01.880]  ma'am, I appreciate your call, that everything should just happen instantly overnight.
[2:41:01.880 --> 2:41:06.280]  No, you have to believe in yourself and continue to persevere, and you've got to have talent.
[2:41:06.280 --> 2:41:09.280]  Right, and you've got to be true to yourself.
[2:41:09.280 --> 2:41:16.560]  If you start making music for other people or to break into the mainstream as your goal,
[2:41:16.560 --> 2:41:19.840]  you're going to be miserable, and your music's not going to be that good.
[2:41:19.840 --> 2:41:20.840]  Yeah, just love your work.
[2:41:20.840 --> 2:41:23.960]  Plus, being successful is actually not marriage, so maybe you don't want that.
[2:41:23.960 --> 2:41:26.080]  Let's go ahead and talk to Stan in Missouri.
[2:41:26.080 --> 2:41:27.640]  Stan, you're on the air.
[2:41:27.640 --> 2:41:28.640]  Welcome.
[2:41:28.640 --> 2:41:29.640]  No, Amy.
[2:41:29.640 --> 2:41:35.480]  What type of songs are you mostly singing about?
[2:41:35.480 --> 2:41:44.440]  Mostly, well, I've spent a lot of years screaming about political, you know, our rights, basically.
[2:41:44.440 --> 2:41:48.440]  But this particular record is, especially after my assault, is more of an introspective
[2:41:48.440 --> 2:41:51.600]  spiritual journey.
[2:41:51.600 --> 2:41:55.600]  Reggae makes me happy, and it's just about, it's just a spiritual journey.
[2:41:55.600 --> 2:42:00.200]  Did you hear the clip earlier about, you know, the Private Fellow Reserve, the CIA, the New
[2:42:00.200 --> 2:42:01.200]  World Order?
[2:42:01.200 --> 2:42:06.800]  I mean, that's the kind of stuff she's, and millions and millions of views, and I've been
[2:42:06.800 --> 2:42:07.800]  very, very successful.
[2:42:07.800 --> 2:42:08.800]  Go ahead.
[2:42:08.800 --> 2:42:14.640]  Do you sing anything about pro-guns, Amy, anything about the gun culture, anything like
[2:42:14.640 --> 2:42:15.640]  that?
[2:42:15.640 --> 2:42:22.440]  I do have a song, yeah, I do have a song on the record, actually, about that, but yeah.
[2:42:22.440 --> 2:42:27.320]  Briefly, I don't, like, I don't have a whole song about it, but, you know, all of my work
[2:42:27.320 --> 2:42:29.880]  is part of me in it, so yes, I believe in...
[2:42:29.880 --> 2:42:32.160]  Now, the gun culture's a big issue, Amy.
[2:42:32.160 --> 2:42:37.080]  Right now, in the small town of Versailles, Missouri, that's where Dave and Joyce Rowley
[2:42:37.080 --> 2:42:42.160]  have their power hour show, a friend of mine told me last night, he called me and said
[2:42:42.160 --> 2:42:47.680]  the teachers in Versailles School are teaching the kids that guns are bad and making them
[2:42:47.680 --> 2:42:52.480]  write essays on it in their classwork now, and then they're telling it's bad for kids
[2:42:52.480 --> 2:42:54.720]  to hunt, and mom, dad to go out and hunt.
[2:42:54.720 --> 2:43:00.240]  No, no, the public schools, when you put your children in school, you lose them, and most
[2:43:00.240 --> 2:43:02.400]  of the major private schools follow the same curriculum.
[2:43:02.400 --> 2:43:06.520]  They teach you, your parents are bad, I mean, I have Time Magazine for kids, saying your
[2:43:06.520 --> 2:43:09.960]  parents are stupid and backwards, you're going to take a chip, you're cool.
[2:43:09.960 --> 2:43:15.520]  I mean, that's almost a quote, that's paraphrasing, and it's there to brainwash.
[2:43:15.520 --> 2:43:17.040]  College is the same thing.
[2:43:17.040 --> 2:43:21.440]  It doesn't matter what class it is, you are paying to be lied to and be brainwashed by
[2:43:21.440 --> 2:43:25.440]  a bunch of government-funded parasites on average, and it's just...
[2:43:25.440 --> 2:43:26.880]  And you can't own school now, so...
[2:43:26.880 --> 2:43:27.880]  Oh, yeah, now they're...
[2:43:27.880 --> 2:43:28.880]  It's illegal.
[2:43:28.880 --> 2:43:31.600]  All over, they're trying to claim it's illegal, ordering people to put their kids in public
[2:43:31.600 --> 2:43:32.600]  schools.
[2:43:32.600 --> 2:43:33.600]  I mean, it's all happening.
[2:43:33.600 --> 2:43:34.600]  Stan, that's outrageous.
[2:43:34.600 --> 2:43:37.640]  There may be some documentation on them, I know it's going on, but even there in small
[2:43:37.640 --> 2:43:39.360]  town, Missouri, thank you.
[2:43:39.360 --> 2:43:41.960]  And Anthony in New York, you're on the air, go ahead Anthony.
[2:43:41.960 --> 2:43:48.280]  Yeah, I was just wondering what are Amy's favorite bands right now, and she was talking
[2:43:48.280 --> 2:43:53.200]  about how her mom sort of woke her up or talked to her about the New World Order when she
[2:43:53.200 --> 2:43:54.200]  was younger.
[2:43:54.200 --> 2:44:00.200]  I was just wondering how her mother woke up and how she sort of took the red pill.
[2:44:00.200 --> 2:44:03.560]  I'll take the answer off there, thanks guys.
[2:44:03.560 --> 2:44:05.320]  I don't know how my mom...
[2:44:05.320 --> 2:44:07.840]  I don't know how my mom did, actually.
[2:44:07.840 --> 2:44:08.840]  I have to ask her that.
[2:44:08.840 --> 2:44:13.840]  I don't know, she's just always been that way, but I'll find that out.
[2:44:13.840 --> 2:44:15.640]  Was that the question?
[2:44:15.640 --> 2:44:17.320]  He was just asking, I'm thinking...
[2:44:17.320 --> 2:44:19.640]  Oh, what bands I listen to.
[2:44:19.640 --> 2:44:25.840]  Actually, music, since it's my job and it's what I do, and I do it all day, every day.
[2:44:25.840 --> 2:44:31.240]  When I have a free moment, I listen to Alex, or I listen to George and Orient Coast to Coast
[2:44:31.240 --> 2:44:35.680]  Sam, and I read a lot, so I'm not...
[2:44:35.680 --> 2:44:36.680]  You read?
[2:44:36.680 --> 2:44:39.760]  I'm surprised reading isn't in this document.
[2:44:39.760 --> 2:44:43.720]  It says community service means you're a terrorist, if it's not for Obama.
[2:44:43.720 --> 2:44:44.720]  You read, folks.
[2:44:44.720 --> 2:44:46.640]  We got one that can read.
[2:44:46.640 --> 2:44:47.640]  Are you with...
[2:44:47.640 --> 2:44:48.640]  Are you violent?
[2:44:48.640 --> 2:44:49.640]  Total terrorist.
[2:44:49.640 --> 2:44:51.400]  Whoa, hold on a minute.
[2:44:51.400 --> 2:44:54.040]  I got something for you to read right here.
[2:44:54.040 --> 2:44:57.040]  You get arrested sometimes having one of these.
[2:44:57.040 --> 2:44:58.040]  You know what this is?
[2:44:58.040 --> 2:44:59.040]  A pocket constitution?
[2:44:59.040 --> 2:45:00.040]  Yeah.
[2:45:00.040 --> 2:45:01.680]  This is paraphernalia, propaganda.
[2:45:01.680 --> 2:45:02.680]  That's right.
[2:45:02.680 --> 2:45:03.680]  It's what they call it.
[2:45:03.680 --> 2:45:04.680]  This is paraphernalia.
[2:45:04.680 --> 2:45:09.680]  We had a private detective on a few days ago, where they pulled him over and he had one
[2:45:09.680 --> 2:45:12.040]  of these, and they just said, buddy, you're going to jail.
[2:45:12.040 --> 2:45:15.200]  They were like, having this doesn't go good for you, boy.
[2:45:15.200 --> 2:45:17.240]  He even knows how to read it.
[2:45:17.240 --> 2:45:23.000]  My friend actually, amazing he brought that up, my friend, my co-producer on this album,
[2:45:23.000 --> 2:45:28.320]  got pulled over by the police, and he had a Bible on his front seat in Indiana.
[2:45:28.320 --> 2:45:31.440]  He had a Bible, and the guy said, what are you doing with that?
[2:45:31.440 --> 2:45:33.080]  And he said, it's a Bible.
[2:45:33.080 --> 2:45:39.080]  My mom gave it to me, and he goes, yeah, anyone having a Bible in their car, there's probably
[2:45:39.080 --> 2:45:40.080]  a gun.
[2:45:40.080 --> 2:45:41.080]  Do you have any guns on you?
[2:45:41.080 --> 2:45:42.080]  And he goes, what?
[2:45:42.080 --> 2:45:43.080]  I have a...
[2:45:43.080 --> 2:45:44.080]  No, I don't have any guns on me.
[2:45:44.080 --> 2:45:47.640]  And he's like, yeah, well, you just don't seem like you can be trusted.
[2:45:47.640 --> 2:45:50.040]  And starting giving him a hard time, he was just absolutely shocked.
[2:45:50.040 --> 2:45:51.040]  I was like...
[2:45:51.040 --> 2:45:52.040]  Where did this happen?
[2:45:52.040 --> 2:45:53.040]  In Indiana.
[2:45:53.040 --> 2:45:54.040]  Okay.
[2:45:54.040 --> 2:45:55.040]  Well, you see, this is what happens.
[2:45:55.040 --> 2:45:56.440]  I get on there and people exaggerate.
[2:45:56.440 --> 2:45:57.740]  It's the opposite.
[2:45:57.740 --> 2:45:59.320]  He broke the Mayak report last week.
[2:45:59.320 --> 2:46:04.280]  It's all over CNN, Fox, Rush Limbaugh, and of course, none of them getting his credit,
[2:46:04.280 --> 2:46:06.040]  AP, everywhere.
[2:46:06.040 --> 2:46:10.400]  And then just sitting here, I start remembering, wait a minute, member in San Francisco, the
[2:46:10.400 --> 2:46:15.240]  feds put out a report, they broke in San Francisco, it was nationwide, four years ago.
[2:46:15.240 --> 2:46:21.760]  And it said, if they have a road atlas, which my car has, as if you're going to have a road
[2:46:21.760 --> 2:46:25.960]  atlas on the road, that they're selling gas stations and truck stops, that that's a sign
[2:46:25.960 --> 2:46:30.400]  you're a terrorist, cell phones, blue jeans, I've got the Texas report coming in here that's
[2:46:30.400 --> 2:46:32.240]  even worse than the Mayak report.
[2:46:32.240 --> 2:46:36.080]  And see, I'm on air, not even trying to demonize them.
[2:46:36.080 --> 2:46:40.280]  It's many times worse than I can even cover because we've got all these reports.
[2:46:40.280 --> 2:46:44.480]  And I've seen reports where it says if they have a Bible.
[2:46:44.480 --> 2:46:47.280]  So see, and then there was another report in the Associated Press about it right from
[2:46:47.280 --> 2:46:48.280]  9-11.
[2:46:48.280 --> 2:46:50.400]  It was like, a woman with a baby carriage, maybe Al-Qaeda.
[2:46:50.400 --> 2:46:52.120]  No, I'm not kidding.
[2:46:52.120 --> 2:46:56.800]  I'm just, and they're going to have neighborhood watch grips, folks.
[2:46:56.800 --> 2:47:00.080]  So how did this end with the evil Bible?
[2:47:00.080 --> 2:47:04.200]  The evil Bible, he let him go, but he harassed him for a long time, made him go out of the
[2:47:04.200 --> 2:47:07.120]  car.
[2:47:07.120 --> 2:47:09.040]  He said he wanted to search the vehicle.
[2:47:09.040 --> 2:47:14.080]  My friend said, you don't have a right to, and it just went back and forth and really,
[2:47:14.080 --> 2:47:15.080]  really harassed him.
[2:47:15.080 --> 2:47:17.440]  And he said, well, I'm going to call the department and tell them that he harassed me because
[2:47:17.440 --> 2:47:18.440]  I had a Bible.
[2:47:18.440 --> 2:47:21.400]  And I said, well, you really should.
[2:47:21.400 --> 2:47:22.400]  He was shocked.
[2:47:22.400 --> 2:47:25.240]  And I said, well, here's a couple of websites so that you're not shocked by this.
[2:47:25.240 --> 2:47:26.600]  So you can kind of understand what's going on.
[2:47:26.600 --> 2:47:29.680]  So I've turned them on to your show and he's pretty stoked.
[2:47:29.680 --> 2:47:34.520]  Well, we'd like him to call in sometime if he can get in or email Rob D at infowars.com.
[2:47:34.520 --> 2:47:38.000]  We'd like to hear more of those stories from people, especially the documented ones.
[2:47:38.000 --> 2:47:40.600]  I mean, ladies in Las Vegas get pulled by the cops.
[2:47:40.600 --> 2:47:41.600]  They shoot video of it.
[2:47:41.600 --> 2:47:42.600]  It's like, why?
[2:47:42.600 --> 2:47:43.600]  There's a Ron Paul sticker here, ma'am.
[2:47:43.600 --> 2:47:44.600]  Why do you have this?
[2:47:44.600 --> 2:47:47.920]  I mean, because they believe they found Al-Qaeda.
[2:47:47.920 --> 2:47:50.560]  They built, I mean, they really believe this.
[2:47:50.560 --> 2:47:54.560]  They really think, folks, police, that's why the elite are criminal.
[2:47:54.560 --> 2:47:59.680]  We're the good guys exposing the criminals and they think you're stupid and they tell
[2:47:59.680 --> 2:48:00.960]  you we're cop killers.
[2:48:00.960 --> 2:48:03.680]  What the whole first page says of the report.
[2:48:03.680 --> 2:48:05.680]  Well, I don't know when it's going to end.
[2:48:05.680 --> 2:48:07.240]  I mean, I feel like this is just the beginning.
[2:48:07.240 --> 2:48:12.680]  I don't know how far it's going to go, making us wear, you know, their own version of the
[2:48:12.680 --> 2:48:15.680]  star, David, and start shipping us off to camps, I guess.
[2:48:15.680 --> 2:48:16.680]  Yeah.
[2:48:16.680 --> 2:48:18.960]  Well, you know, that's what we've got to do for America to keep it safe.
[2:48:18.960 --> 2:48:24.840]  Anthony in New York, you're on the air, Anthony, and we just went to Anthony.
[2:48:24.840 --> 2:48:26.400]  I can't keep track of these callers anymore.
[2:48:26.400 --> 2:48:27.400]  Pat in New York.
[2:48:27.400 --> 2:48:28.400]  Go ahead.
[2:48:28.400 --> 2:48:29.400]  Those are two New York calls.
[2:48:29.400 --> 2:48:30.400]  Hey, Pat.
[2:48:30.400 --> 2:48:31.880]  I want to say thank you to you and Amy for doing a good job.
[2:48:31.880 --> 2:48:32.880]  Patriot.
[2:48:32.880 --> 2:48:33.880]  Thank you.
[2:48:33.880 --> 2:48:34.880]  Well, she can read, though.
[2:48:34.880 --> 2:48:35.880]  That's a sign of Al-Qaeda.
[2:48:35.880 --> 2:48:36.880]  Very suspicious.
[2:48:36.880 --> 2:48:37.880]  Yeah.
[2:48:37.880 --> 2:48:39.880]  She looks as good as she sounds, too.
[2:48:39.880 --> 2:48:40.880]  Thank you.
[2:48:40.880 --> 2:48:41.880]  Well, I just wanted to move on.
[2:48:41.880 --> 2:48:42.880]  I want to try to let you know.
[2:48:42.880 --> 2:48:43.880]  So put the camera on her instead of me.
[2:48:43.880 --> 2:48:44.880]  Hold on.
[2:48:44.880 --> 2:48:45.880]  Yeah.
[2:48:45.880 --> 2:48:46.880]  Over there.
[2:48:46.880 --> 2:48:47.880]  Go ahead.
[2:48:47.880 --> 2:48:49.480]  This is the local law A for Albany County.
[2:48:49.480 --> 2:48:50.480]  They're trying to sneak this through.
[2:48:50.480 --> 2:48:53.360]  It says the regulating the purchase of ammunition.
[2:48:53.360 --> 2:48:57.400]  And what it is, when you start reading this, it's on albanycounty.com.
[2:48:57.400 --> 2:49:00.280]  Right on their website, you go to local law legislature.
[2:49:00.280 --> 2:49:02.840]  And here I'm just going to read section five real quick.
[2:49:02.840 --> 2:49:07.800]  A record shall be kept by the dealer of each sale of ammunition, which shall show the type
[2:49:07.800 --> 2:49:12.200]  caliber and quantity of ammunition sold, the name and address of the person receiving the
[2:49:12.200 --> 2:49:17.440]  same, the caliber, make, model, manufacturers' name, and serial number of the firearm for
[2:49:17.440 --> 2:49:19.800]  which the purchaser is purchasing ammunition.
[2:49:19.800 --> 2:49:20.800]  Oh, my God.
[2:49:20.800 --> 2:49:21.800]  Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[2:49:21.800 --> 2:49:23.600]  I'm going to hold you over.
[2:49:23.600 --> 2:49:27.200]  Red Alert, Red Alert, Call Paul Watson, Call Curtin, and I want to talk to them during
[2:49:27.200 --> 2:49:28.200]  the break.
[2:49:28.200 --> 2:49:30.960]  This is why we're always ahead of everybody else because our listeners give us all the
[2:49:30.960 --> 2:49:31.960]  tips.
[2:49:31.960 --> 2:49:32.960]  And you watch.
[2:49:32.960 --> 2:49:33.960]  We're going to go look at this.
[2:49:33.960 --> 2:49:36.960]  It's going to be real because the feds everywhere are pushing and you hear about stimulus package.
[2:49:36.960 --> 2:49:39.520]  They tell the counties and cities, we're going to give you this money, but we want
[2:49:39.520 --> 2:49:40.520]  you to build a FEMA center.
[2:49:40.520 --> 2:49:41.520]  Right.
[2:49:41.520 --> 2:49:42.520]  We want you to move the army in with your police.
[2:49:42.520 --> 2:49:43.520]  This is now happening.
[2:49:43.520 --> 2:49:44.520]  Mainstream news.
[2:49:44.520 --> 2:49:50.600]  We want you to start with regulations, not a law, just having the local county order
[2:49:50.600 --> 2:49:56.600]  the gun dealers and Walmart and whatever to write down who got ammo for a gun registration
[2:49:56.600 --> 2:49:57.600]  deal.
[2:49:57.600 --> 2:49:58.600]  This is off the charts.
[2:49:58.600 --> 2:49:59.600]  AlbanyCounty.com.
[2:49:59.600 --> 2:50:00.600]  Is this in New York?
[2:50:00.600 --> 2:50:03.600]  Give me the exact page on the information.
[2:50:03.600 --> 2:50:04.600]  Hold on.
[2:50:04.600 --> 2:50:05.600]  Burmese, you already knew about this?
[2:50:05.600 --> 2:50:06.600]  What's that?
[2:50:06.600 --> 2:50:07.600]  Burmese says he already knows.
[2:50:07.600 --> 2:50:08.600]  Right next to Schenectady.
[2:50:08.600 --> 2:50:09.600]  It makes sense.
[2:50:09.600 --> 2:50:10.600]  It's right.
[2:50:10.600 --> 2:50:11.600]  Oh, my God.
[2:50:11.600 --> 2:50:12.600]  Schenectady.
[2:50:12.600 --> 2:50:15.560]  We're going to have martial law and the feds come in and it turns out he's one of these
[2:50:15.560 --> 2:50:17.200]  special mayors of Obama.
[2:50:17.200 --> 2:50:19.800]  We confirmed that with his own documents.
[2:50:19.800 --> 2:50:21.600]  Did you hear the newscast earlier about martial law?
[2:50:21.600 --> 2:50:23.360]  They said, oh, we got a few corrupt cops.
[2:50:23.360 --> 2:50:25.000]  We're going to bring troops in.
[2:50:25.000 --> 2:50:26.000]  No.
[2:50:26.000 --> 2:50:27.000]  Hold on.
[2:50:27.000 --> 2:50:28.000]  My God.
[2:50:28.000 --> 2:50:29.000]  They're implementing martial law.
[2:50:29.000 --> 2:50:30.000]  Okay.
[2:50:30.000 --> 2:50:31.000]  Okay.
[2:50:31.000 --> 2:50:32.000]  Oh, my God.
[2:50:32.000 --> 2:50:33.000]  Okay.
[2:50:33.000 --> 2:50:34.000]  I've got to guys Google this right now.
[2:50:34.000 --> 2:50:35.000]  AlbanyCounty.com.
[2:50:35.000 --> 2:50:36.000]  Where is it on there?
[2:50:36.000 --> 2:50:37.000]  There's this connected email.
[2:50:37.000 --> 2:50:38.000]  Consider his options.
[2:50:38.000 --> 2:50:39.080]  Martial law over police woes.
[2:50:39.080 --> 2:50:41.000]  That's a capital news nine out of Albany.
[2:50:41.000 --> 2:50:43.720]  Sir, where on the side is this new thing?
[2:50:43.720 --> 2:50:50.440]  You go AlbanyCounty.com slash department, last legislature, last resolution.
[2:50:50.440 --> 2:50:51.440]  Stop.
[2:50:51.440 --> 2:50:52.440]  Stop.
[2:50:52.440 --> 2:50:53.440]  That's not how you get it.
[2:50:53.440 --> 2:50:54.440]  I need the name of the resolution.
[2:50:54.440 --> 2:50:55.440]  That'll take us right to it.
[2:50:55.440 --> 2:50:56.440]  What's the name of the resolution?
[2:50:56.440 --> 2:51:00.000]  Resolution 108, local law number A for 2009.
[2:51:00.000 --> 2:51:01.000]  Stay there.
[2:51:01.000 --> 2:51:02.000]  Give it to us during break.
[2:51:02.000 --> 2:51:03.000]  Merchants.
[2:51:03.000 --> 2:51:06.200]  Do you have trouble sleeping due to sensations in your legs?
[2:51:06.200 --> 2:51:08.000]  You are not alone.
[2:51:08.000 --> 2:51:11.200]  Millions of Americans suffer from restless legs.
[2:51:11.200 --> 2:51:16.240]  Restless legs is a condition caused by the uncontrollable urge to move your legs.
[2:51:16.240 --> 2:51:20.640]  Signs include itching, pulling, tugging, and the feeling that bugs are crawling on your
[2:51:20.640 --> 2:51:21.640]  legs.
[2:51:21.640 --> 2:51:25.840]  If having restless legs is preventing you from getting the good night's sleep you deserve
[2:51:25.840 --> 2:51:30.600]  or is preventing you from enjoying life, you need restulix.
[2:51:30.600 --> 2:51:35.560]  Restulix is an all natural supplement that contains 74 essential vitamins, minerals and
[2:51:35.560 --> 2:51:38.680]  herbs that you may not be getting in your diet.

[2:51:43.520 --> 2:51:47.440]  go back to your regular routine without discomfort or embarrassment.
[2:51:47.440 --> 2:51:49.560]  Call 888-4-FIT-LEGS.
[2:51:49.560 --> 2:51:55.200]  That's 888-434-8534 or visit 4FitLegs.com.
[2:51:55.200 --> 2:52:01.920]  That's the number 4 FitLegs.com and ask how you can get Restulix for free today.
[2:52:01.920 --> 2:52:07.360]  On the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[2:52:07.360 --> 2:52:14.000]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[2:52:14.000 --> 2:52:15.320]  just as well funded.
[2:52:15.320 --> 2:52:20.480]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[2:52:20.480 --> 2:52:22.000]  of the American people.
[2:52:22.000 --> 2:52:26.360]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[2:52:26.360 --> 2:52:31.480]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[2:52:31.480 --> 2:52:38.000]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[2:52:38.000 --> 2:52:41.560]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[2:52:41.560 --> 2:52:48.480]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[2:52:48.480 --> 2:52:54.040]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super-high
[2:52:54.040 --> 2:52:56.640]  quality at presentplanet.tv.
[2:52:56.640 --> 2:53:01.440]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[2:53:01.440 --> 2:53:05.040]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[2:53:05.040 --> 2:53:08.720]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the
[2:53:08.720 --> 2:53:09.720]  world.
[2:53:09.720 --> 2:53:14.640]  Utopia, Texas, is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver who
[2:53:14.640 --> 2:53:19.580]  offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates
[2:53:19.580 --> 2:53:21.160]  or saline solutions.
[2:53:21.160 --> 2:53:25.720]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized
[2:53:25.720 --> 2:53:30.400]  at the cellular level, and germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day
[2:53:30.400 --> 2:53:32.040]  antibiotics.
[2:53:32.040 --> 2:53:35.960]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements including colloidal silver, gold
[2:53:35.960 --> 2:53:36.960]  and copper.
[2:53:36.960 --> 2:53:39.880]  With a money-back guarantee on the colloidal products we produce.
[2:53:39.880 --> 2:53:44.160]  For four years Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies that
[2:53:44.160 --> 2:53:48.240]  would steal our God-given rights of health care and freedom of speech.
[2:53:48.240 --> 2:53:59.560]  Visit us today at utopiasilver.com, that's utopiasilver.com or call 888-213-4338, 888-213-4338
[2:53:59.560 --> 2:54:01.560]  and help us win this battle.
[2:54:01.560 --> 2:54:11.480]  Okay, I got Paul Watson right now in line.
[2:54:11.480 --> 2:54:15.360]  This is going to go mega-huge and alert gun owners to all the gun grabbing.
[2:54:15.360 --> 2:54:19.280]  We've documented the nexus point in this area of New York, and they're doing beta
[2:54:19.280 --> 2:54:22.400]  tests to have counties and cities restrict ammo and guns.
[2:54:22.400 --> 2:54:27.520]  If the caller is what he's saying true, the albanycounty.com is basically crashed right
[2:54:27.520 --> 2:54:28.520]  now.
[2:54:28.520 --> 2:54:29.520]  We can't get on it.
[2:54:29.520 --> 2:54:34.800]  Here, if you have that page loaded, screenshot it and email it to robd, the letter D at infowars.com.
[2:54:34.800 --> 2:54:39.640]  Now give us the coordinates for this, and this ties into Albany, New York, surrounding
[2:54:39.640 --> 2:54:43.680]  county, saying we want to have a federal martial law there.
[2:54:43.680 --> 2:54:44.680]  I mean, this is insane.
[2:54:44.680 --> 2:54:48.840]  We just showed the mainstream news story on that, and we played a clip of it in the first
[2:54:48.840 --> 2:54:49.840]  hour.
[2:54:49.840 --> 2:54:57.320]  So, going back to Pat in New York, slowly, albanycounty.com, you go there.
[2:54:57.320 --> 2:55:01.640]  What is the headline on the bill or law or whatever this is?
[2:55:01.640 --> 2:55:02.640]  Tell us specifics.
[2:55:02.640 --> 2:55:03.640]  All right.
[2:55:03.640 --> 2:55:08.240]  This is called local law number A for the county, and it said that's exactly what it
[2:55:08.240 --> 2:55:09.240]  says.
[2:55:09.240 --> 2:55:12.760]  Local law of the county, Albany, New York regulating the purchase of ammunition in the county of
[2:55:12.760 --> 2:55:13.760]  Albany.
[2:55:13.760 --> 2:55:14.760]  Introduced 3909.
[2:55:14.760 --> 2:55:20.120]  I went up there on 3909, I said it was unconstitutional and everything, but I guess it got moved.
[2:55:20.120 --> 2:55:21.120]  They're trying to push it through.
[2:55:21.120 --> 2:55:25.360]  They're trying to push it through law committee Monday, and this is a county law, though, not
[2:55:25.360 --> 2:55:26.360]  a state.
[2:55:26.360 --> 2:55:27.360]  But they're going to start.
[2:55:27.360 --> 2:55:28.360]  It's a precedent.
[2:55:28.360 --> 2:55:29.360]  They're going to start in Albany County.
[2:55:29.360 --> 2:55:30.360]  I don't understand.
[2:55:30.360 --> 2:55:33.240]  Let me stop you, because that's the county where the capital resides.
[2:55:33.240 --> 2:55:34.240]  Correct?
[2:55:34.240 --> 2:55:35.240]  Yes.
[2:55:35.240 --> 2:55:38.080]  I'm just picking your brain here quick on air.
[2:55:38.080 --> 2:55:39.080]  Okay.
[2:55:39.080 --> 2:55:41.680]  Slowly, because I've got Paul Watson listening right now.
[2:55:41.680 --> 2:55:42.680]  They're moving nationwide.
[2:55:42.680 --> 2:55:48.440]  Paul, as you know, he's our quick writer, to restrict ammo, and that's what the big gun
[2:55:48.440 --> 2:55:49.440]  sites have said.
[2:55:49.440 --> 2:55:50.440]  That's the new move.
[2:55:50.440 --> 2:55:53.320]  This thing, demonizing gun owners, says they've got to stamp all the bullets or you're a cop
[2:55:53.320 --> 2:55:54.320]  killer.
[2:55:54.320 --> 2:56:01.280]  Paul Watson here, on page three, right there, see stamping the bullet with your, basically,
[2:56:01.280 --> 2:56:02.560]  your ID on it.
[2:56:02.560 --> 2:56:08.040]  Give it to us again, albanycounty.com, and give us all the subsections, law, and...
[2:56:08.040 --> 2:56:09.800]  I'll give you the web page.
[2:56:09.800 --> 2:56:13.680]  I can give you the link that will bring you right to the PDF file they have.
[2:56:13.680 --> 2:56:14.680]  Okay.
[2:56:14.680 --> 2:56:20.640]  And it's albanycounty, you know, HTTP, www.albanycounty.com, slash department.
[2:56:20.640 --> 2:56:23.200]  Slowly, departments.
[2:56:23.200 --> 2:56:25.480]  Slash legislature.
[2:56:25.480 --> 2:56:26.480]  Legislature.
[2:56:26.480 --> 2:56:28.480]  Slash resolutions.
[2:56:28.480 --> 2:56:29.480]  Uh-huh.
[2:56:29.480 --> 2:56:30.480]  Slash 2009.
[2:56:30.480 --> 2:56:31.480]  Slash 2009.
[2:56:31.480 --> 2:56:32.480]  Oh, three, oh, nine.
[2:56:32.480 --> 2:56:33.480]  Slash, oh, nine.
[2:56:33.480 --> 2:56:42.480]  Oh, what is that thing there, Dave?
[2:56:42.480 --> 2:56:43.880]  Nobody's going to get that.
[2:56:43.880 --> 2:56:48.480]  Just, just slowly, give me the exact headline on the PDF, and that will pull it.
[2:56:48.480 --> 2:56:49.480]  We now have it.
[2:56:49.480 --> 2:56:50.480]  Okay.
[2:56:50.480 --> 2:56:51.480]  Okay.
[2:56:51.480 --> 2:56:53.600]  So, give us, give us the headline, sir.
[2:56:53.600 --> 2:57:00.160]  The headline just says, local law, number, period, space, and quotations A for 2009.
[2:57:00.160 --> 2:57:01.160]  Okay.
[2:57:01.160 --> 2:57:02.160]  Albany, New York.
[2:57:02.160 --> 2:57:03.160]  Okay.
[2:57:03.160 --> 2:57:04.160]  That will, that will help us find it.
[2:57:04.160 --> 2:57:06.960]  You know, email that page right now to Rob Dugas.
[2:57:06.960 --> 2:57:10.480]  It's not loading here for us, because I guess millions are going to check it out.
[2:57:10.480 --> 2:57:13.840]  Uh, so, email that to us right now, and thank you so much.
[2:57:13.840 --> 2:57:15.680]  Uh, what is it, Rob?
[2:57:15.680 --> 2:57:19.320]  Rob, R-O-B-D, at infowars.com.
[2:57:19.320 --> 2:57:21.320]  At infowars.com.
[2:57:21.320 --> 2:57:22.320]  We'll do.
[2:57:22.320 --> 2:57:23.320]  All right.
[2:57:23.320 --> 2:57:24.320]  Thank you so much.
[2:57:24.320 --> 2:57:25.720]  Amy, I'm going to hold you over five more minutes to get Jim in here, because we cut
[2:57:25.720 --> 2:57:26.720]  you short with that right there.
[2:57:26.720 --> 2:57:29.960]  But I mean, that's the, that's the fast-moving nature of this show.
[2:57:29.960 --> 2:57:30.960]  We'll go verify it.
[2:57:30.960 --> 2:57:31.960]  We'll get it out.
[2:57:31.960 --> 2:57:34.120]  And then, Rush Limbaugh will be talking about it next week.
[2:57:34.120 --> 2:57:35.120]  Exactly.
[2:57:35.120 --> 2:57:36.120]  What's up ahead?
[2:57:36.120 --> 2:57:37.120]  Well, we love it.
[2:57:37.120 --> 2:57:38.120]  We just love exposing these bastards.
[2:57:38.120 --> 2:57:39.120]  Look at this Texas report.
[2:57:39.120 --> 2:57:40.560]  I'd forgotten about this one.
[2:57:40.560 --> 2:57:42.800]  We're the ones that scan this and put this on the web.
[2:57:42.800 --> 2:57:46.920]  And then Jim Mars, years later, comes back and reminds me of it and brought a copy in
[2:57:46.920 --> 2:57:47.920]  today.
[2:57:47.920 --> 2:57:48.920]  This was out of Austin, Texas.
[2:57:48.920 --> 2:57:53.800]  And this says, you know, this is almost as bad as this report, and it says, groups that
[2:57:53.800 --> 2:57:57.320]  are involved in community service, public rallies, demonstrations, private meetings
[2:57:57.320 --> 2:58:01.720]  sponsored by support groups, posters, leaflets, websites, and underground press publications
[2:58:01.720 --> 2:58:02.960]  is a sign of terrorism.
[2:58:02.960 --> 2:58:05.080]  It says, how did terrorists gain support?
[2:58:05.080 --> 2:58:11.240]  And then it basically lists scuba training, cell phones, just everything.
[2:58:11.240 --> 2:58:12.240]  We're just all terrorists.
[2:58:12.240 --> 2:58:14.880]  It says, walking, biking, or driving.
[2:58:14.880 --> 2:58:16.360]  No, I'm not kidding.
[2:58:16.360 --> 2:58:17.360]  I'm reading.
[2:58:17.360 --> 2:58:18.360]  I'm giving you the phone numbers here.
[2:58:18.360 --> 2:58:20.240]  I mean, see, folks think I'm exaggerating.
[2:58:20.240 --> 2:58:24.440]  I can't remember all I've learned, all I've seen, all we've documented.
[2:58:24.440 --> 2:58:29.920]  I mean, it's just, I've been mailed hundreds of these by police and military over the years.
[2:58:29.920 --> 2:58:34.240]  And this one, they had a public symposium, and locals went to it and videotaped the whole
[2:58:34.240 --> 2:58:35.240]  thing.
[2:58:35.240 --> 2:58:38.640]  So somewhere around here, we have the whole videotape of them teaching this to a huge
[2:58:38.640 --> 2:58:39.640]  crowd of people.
[2:58:39.640 --> 2:58:40.640]  Stay with us.
[2:58:40.640 --> 2:58:45.120]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[2:58:45.120 --> 2:58:49.000]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[2:58:49.000 --> 2:58:52.200]  Hello, friends.
[2:58:52.200 --> 2:58:53.200]  This is Alex Jones.
[2:58:53.200 --> 2:58:57.040]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more
[2:58:57.040 --> 2:58:58.040]  important than ever.
[2:58:58.040 --> 2:59:01.000]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[2:59:01.000 --> 2:59:03.800]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[2:59:03.800 --> 2:59:07.800]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family.
[2:59:07.800 --> 2:59:11.760]  In any emergency, if you simply prepare, no one is going to take care of your family in
[2:59:11.760 --> 2:59:13.360]  the final equation between you.
[2:59:13.360 --> 2:59:17.600]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift horrible food that's safe from E. coli,
[2:59:17.600 --> 2:59:21.400]  salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports, and they do it at almost half the
[2:59:21.400 --> 2:59:23.640]  cost of last year's grocery prices.
[2:59:23.640 --> 2:59:28.960]  Call 1-800-409-5633, or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[2:59:28.960 --> 2:59:33.640]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high quality, freeze-dried, and dehydrated
[2:59:33.640 --> 2:59:35.120]  foods they have to offer.
[2:59:35.120 --> 2:59:36.120]  Watch the free videos.
[2:59:36.120 --> 2:59:41.520]  Look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[2:59:41.520 --> 2:59:46.480]  Or on the web, at eFoodsDirect.com.
[2:59:46.480 --> 2:59:47.480]  Take action today.
[2:59:47.480 --> 2:59:54.320]  The first step is getting storable food.
[2:59:54.320 --> 2:59:56.520]  Waging war on corruption.
[2:59:56.520 --> 3:00:02.520]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, initiate.
[3:00:02.520 --> 3:00:11.840]  Man, this show has blasted past, faster than anything I've ever remembered.
[3:00:11.840 --> 3:00:17.480]  We're already three hours in, final hour jam-packed, Jim Maher's next segment in studio for 52
[3:00:17.480 --> 3:00:21.600]  minutes with us today.
[3:00:21.600 --> 3:00:24.920]  And everything we've ever talked about is now just being flaunted in our face.
[3:00:24.920 --> 3:00:30.640]  I have it registering anybody to buy bullets, keeping records of them, absolute high tyranny.
[3:00:30.640 --> 3:00:35.600]  Feds making their move in upstate New York for total takeover and martial law.
[3:00:35.600 --> 3:00:40.600]  Put the martial law headline up as they prepare martial law in that area.
[3:00:40.600 --> 3:00:43.920]  I will now be attacked by national news saying it doesn't exist, even though it's mainstream
[3:00:43.920 --> 3:00:44.920]  news.
[3:00:44.920 --> 3:00:48.920]  Then next week they will announce it's all true, but Glenn Beck will say he's our friend
[3:00:48.920 --> 3:00:51.480]  and maybe it's needed.
[3:00:51.480 --> 3:00:56.640]  But local law number A for 2009, a local law for the county of Albany, New York regulating
[3:00:56.640 --> 3:00:59.640]  the purchase of ammunition in the county of Albany.
[3:00:59.640 --> 3:01:03.520]  So they are moving and moving everywhere with similar things.
[3:01:03.520 --> 3:01:10.120]  Jail time, $1,000 fines, how's that sound?
[3:01:10.120 --> 3:01:15.920]  It sounds, you know, typical, it sounds like, I feel like this is just the tip of the iceberg.
[3:01:15.920 --> 3:01:16.920]  This is just the beginning.
[3:01:16.920 --> 3:01:20.160]  But you were saying during the break the good news is you have a lot of military contacting
[3:01:20.160 --> 3:01:21.160]  you on your MySpace.
[3:01:21.160 --> 3:01:24.200]  Give out some of your websites or your MySpace and talk about the troops and people that
[3:01:24.200 --> 3:01:25.200]  are contacting you.
[3:01:25.200 --> 3:01:31.440]  So you have MySpace.com backslash Amy Allen is a good way to contact me, Amy Allen.com
[3:01:31.440 --> 3:01:32.440]  is another one.
[3:01:32.440 --> 3:01:38.080]  But yeah, I do have a lot of police contacting me and a lot of military personnel, soldiers,
[3:01:38.080 --> 3:01:45.840]  and they say, let's organize, we got the guns, let's get together, let's take back our country.
[3:01:45.840 --> 3:01:50.480]  And they don't, you know, they'll give phone numbers or private emails, but there's a definite
[3:01:50.480 --> 3:01:56.320]  movement within our military to not accept tyranny and they took an oath to defend the
[3:01:56.320 --> 3:02:02.680]  Constitution and they're not going to lay down and die unless it's for this country.
[3:02:02.680 --> 3:02:06.920]  But these scumbag parasite bureaucrats that work for the offshore banks, they just can't
[3:02:06.920 --> 3:02:07.920]  help it.
[3:02:07.920 --> 3:02:08.920]  They hate the fact we're armed.
[3:02:08.920 --> 3:02:10.240]  They hate the fact we have wealth.
[3:02:10.240 --> 3:02:11.640]  They are control freak.
[3:02:11.640 --> 3:02:14.000]  Everybody's known control freak scum in their lives.
[3:02:14.000 --> 3:02:16.680]  Well control freak scum try to get in positions of power.
[3:02:16.680 --> 3:02:19.400]  They love ruling over us and I got news for you, bastard.
[3:02:19.400 --> 3:02:20.400]  You're not going to get away with it.
[3:02:20.400 --> 3:02:22.640]  And they want to kill us most importantly.
[3:02:22.640 --> 3:02:26.320]  Well, yeah, the people running things, are you Genesis?
[3:02:26.320 --> 3:02:29.880]  And it's just, it's all getting more and more insane.
[3:02:29.880 --> 3:02:33.960]  So are you playing anywhere else while you're in town in Austin for South by Southwest?
[3:02:33.960 --> 3:02:38.840]  No, I played three shows yesterday and the day before and now it's just time for me to
[3:02:38.840 --> 3:02:39.840]  enjoy Austin and hang out.
[3:02:39.840 --> 3:02:43.400]  Well, at least we got a plug in two nights ago when you were on Jason Burmes's Info War
[3:02:43.400 --> 3:02:44.400]  show from nine to midnight.
[3:02:44.400 --> 3:02:45.400]  So that's great.
[3:02:45.400 --> 3:02:46.400]  Yeah, that's really, really great.
[3:02:46.400 --> 3:02:50.000]  Anyone who listened to the show to come down and they get a free drink, so well, a few
[3:02:50.000 --> 3:02:51.400]  listeners that came down.
[3:02:51.400 --> 3:02:52.400]  Wow.
[3:02:52.400 --> 3:02:56.320]  So I'm, I'm just excited to have you here and I appreciate you, you know, coming into
[3:02:56.320 --> 3:02:59.920]  studio and you were telling me during the break, you might move to Austin.
[3:02:59.920 --> 3:03:01.720]  I'm thinking about it.
[3:03:01.720 --> 3:03:07.480]  You know, I feel like I need to get out of California and this, this be a good spot.
[3:03:07.480 --> 3:03:10.280]  Everybody I know in California is talking about getting out of California, right?
[3:03:10.280 --> 3:03:14.360]  Well, if, you know, if things go down and there's martial law, I feel like Texas would
[3:03:14.360 --> 3:03:19.080]  be a good safe place to be, you know, a lot safer than California.
[3:03:19.080 --> 3:03:22.880]  Well, especially Austin, we've done our due diligence here, planting the seeds of liberty
[3:03:22.880 --> 3:03:23.880]  everywhere.
[3:03:23.880 --> 3:03:24.880]  Yeah.
[3:03:24.880 --> 3:03:28.440]  And so there's all, we're pretty much the majority here of people who can think they're
[3:03:28.440 --> 3:03:29.440]  on the team.
[3:03:29.440 --> 3:03:30.440]  So.
[3:03:30.440 --> 3:03:34.880]  And the, and the weather's nicer here than Montana, so it's a little cold up there.
[3:03:34.880 --> 3:03:37.160]  Oh, so you've also thought about going back to Montana.
[3:03:37.160 --> 3:03:41.040]  Well, it's, yeah, I mean, they didn't have a speed limit for the longest time, but until
[3:03:41.040 --> 3:03:43.320]  the fed imposed, imposed one.
[3:03:43.320 --> 3:03:44.320]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[3:03:44.320 --> 3:03:45.320]  Yeah.
[3:03:45.320 --> 3:03:48.000]  I, I, I love driving 110 miles an hour right past state troopers.
[3:03:48.000 --> 3:03:49.000]  Nothing happens.
[3:03:49.000 --> 3:03:50.000]  Yeah.
[3:03:50.000 --> 3:03:51.000]  But now they'll get you, huh?
[3:03:51.000 --> 3:03:52.000]  Well, the fed imposed, they said you have to have a speed limit.
[3:03:52.000 --> 3:03:57.160]  So cops now, you know, it's a $20 fine if you speed my, uh, my sister told me yesterday.
[3:03:57.160 --> 3:03:59.760]  She's like, I got a ticket and I said, you're going to pay you now.
[3:03:59.760 --> 3:04:01.040]  He said, yeah, 20 bucks.
[3:04:01.040 --> 3:04:02.280]  She goes, here's 40.
[3:04:02.280 --> 3:04:03.280]  Call your buddies.
[3:04:03.280 --> 3:04:04.280]  I'm going to be flying down.
[3:04:04.280 --> 3:04:08.000]  So, I mean, Montana is just a little different than, uh, in California.
[3:04:08.000 --> 3:04:09.000]  Yeah.
[3:04:09.000 --> 3:04:10.000]  We need people like that here in Texas.
[3:04:10.000 --> 3:04:13.360]  Texas has a lot of tyranny as well, it's not perfect.
[3:04:13.360 --> 3:04:16.400]  Amy Allen's new album, a little happiness.
[3:04:16.400 --> 3:04:17.400]  When's it come out?
[3:04:17.400 --> 3:04:18.400]  Uh, June 9th.
[3:04:18.400 --> 3:04:19.400]  Everywhere.
[3:04:19.400 --> 3:04:20.400]  June 9th.
[3:04:20.400 --> 3:04:21.400]  So we're only talking about a month or so.
[3:04:21.400 --> 3:04:22.400]  A month and a half.
[3:04:22.400 --> 3:04:23.400]  Yeah.
[3:04:23.400 --> 3:04:24.400]  Okay.
[3:04:24.400 --> 3:04:25.400]  There it is.
[3:04:25.400 --> 3:04:26.400]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[3:04:26.400 --> 3:04:27.400]  And, uh, be sure and check it out again.
[3:04:27.400 --> 3:04:28.400]  Fire out those websites.
[3:04:28.400 --> 3:04:29.400]  One more time for folks.
[3:04:29.400 --> 3:04:30.400]  Amy Allen.

[3:04:34.400 --> 3:04:35.400]  And my space.

[3:04:36.400 --> 3:04:37.400]  Backslash.
[3:04:37.400 --> 3:04:38.400]  Amy Allen.
[3:04:38.400 --> 3:04:39.400]  All right.
[3:04:39.400 --> 3:04:40.400]  We're going to fight for liberty.
[3:04:40.400 --> 3:04:42.200]  Getting the word out through music.
[3:04:42.200 --> 3:04:43.200]  We've really solution.
[3:04:43.200 --> 3:04:44.200]  Appreciate you.
[3:04:44.200 --> 3:04:45.200]  Godspeed.
[3:04:45.200 --> 3:04:46.200]  Thank you.
[3:04:46.200 --> 3:04:47.200]  Thank you for having me.
[3:04:47.200 --> 3:04:48.200]  Good to have her here with us.
[3:04:48.200 --> 3:04:49.200]  Jim Mars.
[3:04:49.200 --> 3:04:53.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, in that seat, in three minutes when we get back, prisonplanet.com,
[3:04:53.800 --> 3:04:59.240]  info wars.com, prisonplanet.tv, and the Obama deception is now out on DVD.
[3:04:59.240 --> 3:05:02.000]  Get it and get it out, folks, the info war.
[3:05:02.000 --> 3:05:05.080]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap or detergent?
[3:05:05.080 --> 3:05:08.800]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfate, sodium.
[3:05:08.800 --> 3:05:10.680]  Or maldehydes and more.
[3:05:10.680 --> 3:05:15.240]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which
[3:05:15.240 --> 3:05:16.240]  are synthetic.
[3:05:16.240 --> 3:05:17.640]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[3:05:17.640 --> 3:05:21.360]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to
[3:05:21.360 --> 3:05:25.840]  coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin and
[3:05:25.840 --> 3:05:26.840]  mucous membranes.
[3:05:26.840 --> 3:05:32.560]  Now compare a cow, Ben, pure soap, all natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal
[3:05:32.560 --> 3:05:33.560]  testing.
[3:05:33.560 --> 3:05:38.320]  They're safe and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[3:05:38.320 --> 3:05:42.120]  You're saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[3:05:42.120 --> 3:05:43.120]  Keep it natural.
[3:05:43.120 --> 3:05:51.560]  Call Cow Ben Pure Soap for a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091 or log on to 5starsope.com.

[3:05:56.120 --> 3:06:02.200]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[3:06:02.200 --> 3:06:07.600]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:06:07.600 --> 3:06:14.280]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[3:06:14.280 --> 3:06:15.600]  just as well funded.
[3:06:15.600 --> 3:06:20.720]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[3:06:20.720 --> 3:06:22.240]  of the American people.
[3:06:22.240 --> 3:06:26.280]  While Obama's already fudging, yeah, fudged since day one in this election.
[3:06:26.280 --> 3:06:31.720]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[3:06:31.720 --> 3:06:38.240]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:06:38.240 --> 3:06:39.920]  It's not about left or right.
[3:06:39.920 --> 3:06:41.800]  It's about a one world government.
[3:06:41.800 --> 3:06:48.720]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[3:08:41.840 --> 3:08:47.520]  Solartherm, the pain care you wear.
[3:08:47.520 --> 3:08:53.880]  It says walking, biking, or driving in near-potential targets, wearing a specific valid reason,
[3:08:53.880 --> 3:09:00.840]  may create surveillance, trial runs, it says attend, practice in, or practice a spiritual
[3:09:00.840 --> 3:09:07.680]  indoctrination, prepare for financial or fanatical self-sacrifice, scuba, public rallies, demonstrations
[3:09:07.680 --> 3:09:13.520]  and private meetings sponsored by support groups, posters, leaflets, websites, underground
[3:09:13.520 --> 3:09:17.840]  protests, how to terrace, gain support, what they have here, and they go through, trained
[3:09:17.840 --> 3:09:21.880]  to avoid confrontations with law enforcement and therefore can be expected to project
[3:09:21.880 --> 3:09:22.880]  a nice guy image.
[3:09:22.880 --> 3:09:25.800]  They have another area in here where they talk about, you know, they're involved in
[3:09:25.800 --> 3:09:26.800]  community things.
[3:09:26.800 --> 3:09:28.600]  They want to be involved in government.
[3:09:28.600 --> 3:09:34.000]  They're constitutionalists, they're into, they're into the Second Amendment, cameras
[3:09:34.000 --> 3:09:38.120]  and surveillance equipment, baby formulas, cigarettes, beer, wine, liquor.
[3:09:38.120 --> 3:09:40.600]  And they travel with women and children.
[3:09:40.600 --> 3:09:45.280]  That's right, it says they travel with women and children.
[3:09:45.280 --> 3:09:47.280]  I mean, it goes on and on.
[3:09:47.280 --> 3:09:50.320]  And are polite to police.
[3:09:50.320 --> 3:09:53.280]  It says who are the terrorists, it says right here, in fact, we're going to put that up
[3:09:53.280 --> 3:09:54.280]  on screen.
[3:09:54.280 --> 3:09:55.600]  I have a scan of that, don't we?
[3:09:55.600 --> 3:10:00.760]  On the front page, down below the Texas seal, it says introduction, and it says who are
[3:10:00.760 --> 3:10:01.760]  the terrorists?
[3:10:01.760 --> 3:10:03.840]  I guess they're public rallies and people like that.
[3:10:03.840 --> 3:10:04.840]  Jim Maher's good to see you.
[3:10:04.840 --> 3:10:05.840]  Tell us about this.
[3:10:05.840 --> 3:10:11.680]  Well, this has, of course, been ongoing, this is, as you said, you had this a few years
[3:10:11.680 --> 3:10:14.680]  ago and I had people send it to me.
[3:10:14.680 --> 3:10:21.360]  It's just absolutely incredible that the police are being trained to, I mean, there's always
[3:10:21.360 --> 3:10:23.640]  been a cop mentality, okay?
[3:10:23.640 --> 3:10:27.960]  And I understand this because for about a dozen years, I was a police reporter.
[3:10:27.960 --> 3:10:32.160]  And this is back in the days of the old republic when I actually ran with the cops.
[3:10:32.160 --> 3:10:33.160]  I mean, it was amazing.
[3:10:33.160 --> 3:10:38.000]  I had a little snappy brim hat and sometimes I actually carried my press card in my hat
[3:10:38.000 --> 3:10:42.360]  band and I was good friends with the homicide detectives.
[3:10:42.360 --> 3:10:46.720]  They get a call on a murder and I just run out there with them and we'd go in the house
[3:10:46.720 --> 3:10:51.640]  and I'd step over the blood and the stuff and, you know, I'm right there.
[3:10:51.640 --> 3:10:58.280]  And then what happened was is that I suppose by the early 70s, radio got in on the act
[3:10:58.280 --> 3:11:02.600]  and you remember they started carrying those portable tape recorders, right?
[3:11:02.600 --> 3:11:06.680]  And so the next thing you know, instead of just one news reporter with a pad and pencil,
[3:11:06.680 --> 3:11:10.640]  now you've got five or six radio reporters with tape recorders and it wasn't very long
[3:11:10.640 --> 3:11:16.120]  after that because before all of a sudden TV showed up and they had handheld wind up
[3:11:16.120 --> 3:11:20.440]  cameras and then pretty soon they had light people and then they had, you know, pretty
[3:11:20.440 --> 3:11:22.760]  You were at the Fort Worth Star telegram at the time, right?
[3:11:22.760 --> 3:11:27.560]  And so naturally you couldn't let 20, 30 people and all their equipment into a crime scene.
[3:11:27.560 --> 3:11:31.680]  So they started keeping everybody outside the house, outside the building and you had to
[3:11:31.680 --> 3:11:37.560]  wait until the police public information guy came out to tell you what was going on.
[3:11:37.560 --> 3:11:43.160]  And today, of course, now they string that yellow tape around and push you back 12, 14,
[3:11:43.160 --> 3:11:48.040]  20 blocks and nobody can see what's truly going on.
[3:11:48.040 --> 3:11:50.120]  And I lived through all this.
[3:11:50.120 --> 3:11:51.400]  I know how it happened.
[3:11:51.400 --> 3:11:52.400]  I know why it happened.
[3:11:52.400 --> 3:11:55.800]  But now we have secret police under federal control.
[3:11:55.800 --> 3:12:01.480]  They're putting military officers as liaison publicly in every major and even small departments
[3:12:01.480 --> 3:12:06.440]  and they say, you know, don't distribute these, but it's basically saying anybody and everybody's
[3:12:06.440 --> 3:12:07.440]  a terrorist.
[3:12:07.440 --> 3:12:11.360]  If you have a road almanac, if you've got a cell phone, if you're wearing blue jeans,
[3:12:11.360 --> 3:12:13.440]  it literally lists everybody and everything.
[3:12:13.440 --> 3:12:14.440]  That's right.
[3:12:14.440 --> 3:12:18.520]  And says, by the way, here's a point, possession of global positioning systems.
[3:12:18.520 --> 3:12:19.520]  Okay.
[3:12:19.520 --> 3:12:22.600]  If you've got a GPS, you must be a terrorist.
[3:12:22.600 --> 3:12:23.600]  It's incredible.
[3:12:23.600 --> 3:12:28.440]  Alex, when I was a youngster, you know, back in the old days, we were taught to respect
[3:12:28.440 --> 3:12:34.480]  the police and unfortunately now it's getting to be them and us and them attitude, both
[3:12:34.480 --> 3:12:39.720]  on the part of the public, because they have been turned into so many things that are other
[3:12:39.720 --> 3:12:43.040]  than what I consider legitimate law enforcement.
[3:12:43.040 --> 3:12:44.040]  Well, let me just add.
[3:12:44.040 --> 3:12:45.880]  This is one of the public reports.
[3:12:45.880 --> 3:12:47.280]  Imagine how bad the secret ones are.
[3:12:47.280 --> 3:12:51.520]  Well, evenizing Ron Paul, you know, we have the secret reports, but that that says what
[3:12:51.520 --> 3:12:52.800]  the public needs to know.
[3:12:52.800 --> 3:12:56.760]  We'll put it back up on screen and I've seen some of the secret Texas reports.
[3:12:56.760 --> 3:12:58.160]  They're just as bad as this one.
[3:12:58.160 --> 3:13:00.040]  Well, and let me tell you something.
[3:13:00.040 --> 3:13:04.240]  This goes back several years, but I broke a story while I was at the Star Telegram about
[3:13:04.240 --> 3:13:09.560]  an airline pilot who had gone to a Dallas City Council meeting and it simply got up
[3:13:09.560 --> 3:13:15.640]  and asked some questions about the new proposed Comanche Peak power plant and a DPS undercover
[3:13:15.640 --> 3:13:20.560]  agent had gone back, filed a report and checked it as subversive.
[3:13:20.560 --> 3:13:24.520]  And then they sent this report to the pilot's employer.
[3:13:24.520 --> 3:13:28.000]  Luckily for him, his employer happened to be a friend and he said, look at this.
[3:13:28.000 --> 3:13:29.600]  They've got you down as a subversive.
[3:13:29.600 --> 3:13:35.320]  Well, it's come out that pro-life groups, bike riding groups, anti-death penalty groups,
[3:13:35.320 --> 3:13:38.640]  they have state police in them trying to get them to carry out violence.
[3:13:38.640 --> 3:13:42.080]  I mean, mainline, now they have army intelligence spying on the people.
[3:13:42.080 --> 3:13:43.080]  Right.
[3:13:43.080 --> 3:13:45.120]  This is the opposite of what a free society is.
[3:13:45.120 --> 3:13:46.120]  Absolutely.
[3:13:46.120 --> 3:13:50.400]  And now that you mentioned these agents provocateur, I want to tell everybody that's listening
[3:13:50.400 --> 3:13:51.400]  to your show.
[3:13:51.400 --> 3:13:55.560]  If you're in any kind of group and somebody starts acting up and says, let's go beat up
[3:13:55.560 --> 3:13:59.760]  somebody or let's throw rocks to here, grab those people and get them out of there.
[3:13:59.760 --> 3:14:04.160]  Because violence is, that's exactly what they want.
[3:14:04.160 --> 3:14:08.120]  They want violence so that they can instill martial law.
[3:14:08.120 --> 3:14:09.560]  You're absolutely right.
[3:14:09.560 --> 3:14:12.080]  I want to get back into this report later.
[3:14:12.080 --> 3:14:17.520]  But right now you've got some breaking news from mainline UN documents about who's really
[3:14:17.520 --> 3:14:19.680]  calling the shots and running things.
[3:14:19.680 --> 3:14:21.560]  Let's go ahead and get into that right now.
[3:14:21.560 --> 3:14:26.640]  Well, I just want everybody to be aware because, as you know, I kind of operate on a macro,
[3:14:26.640 --> 3:14:30.680]  global, political thing, I want to know who's really running the show.
[3:14:30.680 --> 3:14:34.640]  And then we hear now that Obama's in and now we're in for change.
[3:14:34.640 --> 3:14:39.920]  But I think we need to look at the remarks of his national security advisor, General
[3:14:39.920 --> 3:14:49.280]  James L. Jones, who last month was at the 45th Munich security conference in Germany.
[3:14:49.280 --> 3:14:51.440]  And they had honored Henry Kissinger.
[3:14:51.440 --> 3:14:57.880]  And of course, we all remember Henry Kissinger, Secretary of State, under Nixon.
[3:14:57.880 --> 3:15:02.240]  And the guy who's responsible for our foreign policy that's gotten us in the mess we're
[3:15:02.240 --> 3:15:05.640]  in right now.
[3:15:05.640 --> 3:15:09.800]  Also a man who has wanted in several countries for war crimes and can't even go into those
[3:15:09.800 --> 3:15:13.080]  countries because there are warrants out for his arrest.
[3:15:13.080 --> 3:15:18.360]  So I think that your listeners need to understand when I tell you that the remarks by James
[3:15:18.360 --> 3:15:22.520]  L. Jones to the Munich security conference open with this.
[3:15:22.520 --> 3:15:25.720]  Thank you for that wonderful tribute to Henry Kissinger yesterday.
[3:15:25.720 --> 3:15:27.360]  Congratulations.
[3:15:27.360 --> 3:15:33.160]  As the most recent national security advisor of the United States, now listen carefully.
[3:15:33.160 --> 3:15:39.320]  I take my daily orders from Dr. Kissinger, filtered down to General Brent Snowcroft
[3:15:39.320 --> 3:15:41.560]  and Sandy Berger, who is also here.
[3:15:41.560 --> 3:15:47.320]  We have a chain of command in the National Security Council that exists today.
[3:15:47.320 --> 3:15:50.400]  And I ask you, so where's the change?
[3:15:50.400 --> 3:15:54.440]  Obama's National Security Advisor takes his daily orders from Henry Kissinger.
[3:15:54.440 --> 3:15:55.440]  Where's the change?
[3:15:55.440 --> 3:15:59.600]  Well, I mean, the Pope is advised by Kissinger because he works for the Rothschilds and Rockefellers
[3:15:59.600 --> 3:16:00.600]  publicly.
[3:16:00.600 --> 3:16:01.600]  Exactly.
[3:16:01.600 --> 3:16:05.120]  And he gets up on MSNBC, it's in the Obama deception, and says, Obama's going to sell
[3:16:05.120 --> 3:16:10.000]  the world on a new world order, a global banking elite, where we pay our carbon taxes
[3:16:10.000 --> 3:16:11.240]  to them.
[3:16:11.240 --> 3:16:12.240]  And there's no change.
[3:16:12.240 --> 3:16:14.120]  It doesn't matter who comes into office.
[3:16:14.120 --> 3:16:17.700]  You've got these imperial legates like Henry Kissinger, who are really around the shots
[3:16:17.700 --> 3:16:19.080]  since the big New Brzezinski.
[3:16:19.080 --> 3:16:22.240]  Go over, again, the providence of that, where you got that specifically, where folks are
[3:16:22.240 --> 3:16:23.240]  finding it.
[3:16:23.240 --> 3:16:28.120]  Well, I pointed this out, and specifically the line, he says, I take my daily orders
[3:16:28.120 --> 3:16:29.680]  from Henry Kissinger.
[3:16:29.680 --> 3:16:33.680]  This is Barack Obama's National Security Advisor, okay?
[3:16:33.680 --> 3:16:36.080]  And people said, oh, well, where'd that come from?
[3:16:36.080 --> 3:16:37.080]  That can't be true.
[3:16:37.080 --> 3:16:42.480]  So, you know, somebody that can, you know, folks, it's right off the Council on Foreign
[3:16:42.480 --> 3:16:43.800]  Relations website.
[3:16:43.800 --> 3:16:44.800]  This is from the CFR.
[3:16:44.800 --> 3:16:45.800]  Yeah.
[3:16:45.800 --> 3:16:51.280]  If you, up at the top, if you want to show that, give me a close shot on this camera,
[3:16:51.280 --> 3:16:52.560]  we'll go on this camera right here.
[3:16:52.560 --> 3:16:56.520]  Just go to the Council on Foreign Relations website.
[3:16:56.520 --> 3:16:58.240]  The gloves are coming off, Alex.
[3:16:58.240 --> 3:17:00.080]  They don't care who knows now.
[3:17:00.080 --> 3:17:01.520]  And why do you think that is?
[3:17:01.520 --> 3:17:10.400]  Well, because ever since their inception back in 1921-22, they've moved very, very surreptitiously,
[3:17:10.400 --> 3:17:17.280]  deceitfully, keeping everything under quiet, under wraps, but beginning with the assassination
[3:17:17.280 --> 3:17:21.880]  of President Kennedy and with the control they had over Lyndon Johnson and then over
[3:17:21.880 --> 3:17:29.200]  Richard Nixon, who was putting the politics with Nazi money, they have slowly grown in
[3:17:29.200 --> 3:17:33.680]  their power and in their control to the point where now they don't really care what you
[3:17:33.680 --> 3:17:34.680]  know.
[3:17:34.680 --> 3:17:38.680]  And their attitude now is almost, we're in charge, what are you going to do about it?
[3:17:38.680 --> 3:17:39.680]  That's right.
[3:17:39.680 --> 3:17:43.480]  This is from the Council on Foreign Relations, CFR.org.
[3:17:43.480 --> 3:17:48.360]  You can just Google, Remarks by National Security Advisor Jones at 45th Munit Conference.
[3:17:48.360 --> 3:17:50.800]  In fact, we'll get that up on screen right now.
[3:17:50.800 --> 3:17:55.640]  Remarks by National Security Advisor Jones at 45th Munit Conference on Security Policy.
[3:17:55.640 --> 3:17:59.760]  When you read even the public CFR stuff and trilateral commission stuff, they said in
[3:17:59.760 --> 3:18:03.720]  the 70s they were going to bankrupt the world economy, bring in a global currency.
[3:18:03.720 --> 3:18:07.560]  And we're here warning people and so we get put in terrorism reports because we go to
[3:18:07.560 --> 3:18:10.200]  the CFR and say, oh, look what's going on.
[3:18:10.200 --> 3:18:14.080]  When all we do is cover the facts here of the bankers raping everybody.
[3:18:14.080 --> 3:18:18.440]  Basically, Alex, you and I are simply reporters, the real terrorists are the people who are
[3:18:18.440 --> 3:18:20.560]  actually implementing these policies.
[3:18:20.560 --> 3:18:21.560]  Absolutely.
[3:18:21.560 --> 3:18:23.240]  I mean, this is so important.
[3:18:23.240 --> 3:18:24.240]  Read that again to people.
[3:18:24.240 --> 3:18:26.800]  I mean, that is powerful, Jim, that you brought in.
[3:18:26.800 --> 3:18:33.040]  The day before they had honored Henry Kissinger at the 45th Munit Conference and so the next
[3:18:33.040 --> 3:18:39.600]  day at the Hotel Bayer-Sherhoff on February the 8th, 2009, Barack Obama's newly named
[3:18:39.600 --> 3:18:44.320]  National Security Advisor General James L. Jones gets up and he says, thank you for
[3:18:44.320 --> 3:18:47.320]  that wonderful tribute to Henry Kissinger yesterday.
[3:18:47.320 --> 3:18:48.560]  Congratulations.
[3:18:48.560 --> 3:18:53.760]  As the most recent National Security Advisor of the United States, I take my daily orders
[3:18:53.760 --> 3:18:58.440]  from Dr. Kissinger, filtered down through General Brent Snowcroft and Sandy Berger who's
[3:18:58.440 --> 3:18:59.440]  also here.
[3:18:59.440 --> 3:19:03.560]  We have a chain of command in the National Security Council that exists today.
[3:19:03.560 --> 3:19:07.960]  In other words, the same people are still running the show through the National Security
[3:19:07.960 --> 3:19:08.960]  Council.
[3:19:08.960 --> 3:19:10.960]  Yeah, these are people who aren't even officially in the National Security Council.
[3:19:10.960 --> 3:19:11.960]  Who voted for Henry Kissinger.
[3:19:11.960 --> 3:19:14.560]  Listen, they're not in the National Security Council officially, but remember the Washington
[3:19:14.560 --> 3:19:16.000]  Post three weeks ago.
[3:19:16.000 --> 3:19:20.720]  They said that under North Common Homeland Security, Congress has no authority repeating
[3:19:20.720 --> 3:19:26.960]  PDD 51 and that the National Security Council rules all, not even the president.
[3:19:26.960 --> 3:19:31.000]  The president's a guy, whether it's George Bush or Ronald Reagan or Barack Obama, who
[3:19:31.000 --> 3:19:35.120]  goes and reads off a teleprompter and that's all he does and then he goes and plays basketball
[3:19:35.120 --> 3:19:37.280]  and smokes cigarettes in his own words.
[3:19:37.280 --> 3:19:41.560]  So and then we're having these stupid childish arguments with Obama supporters or Bush supporters
[3:19:41.560 --> 3:19:45.800]  when the elite admit they're running everything instead of the puppets.
[3:19:45.800 --> 3:19:48.280]  Look past the puppets to the actual elite.
[3:19:48.280 --> 3:19:54.200]  The Obama deception on sale now, by the way, on DVD, edinfowars.com, get it, show it to
[3:19:54.200 --> 3:19:57.200]  everybody this exposes their whole agenda.
[3:19:57.200 --> 3:19:59.560]  Everybody will watch it because Obama is hot right now.
[3:19:59.560 --> 3:20:00.560]  Use this tool.
[3:20:00.560 --> 3:20:02.000]  People are ready to wake up.
[3:20:02.000 --> 3:20:05.440]  Everyone knows that omega three should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[3:20:05.440 --> 3:20:09.280]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective
[3:20:09.280 --> 3:20:11.120]  way to get your daily intake?
[3:20:11.120 --> 3:20:15.480]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American nutrition have the answer.
[3:20:15.480 --> 3:20:18.080]  Nature's Gem, premium omega three.
[3:20:18.080 --> 3:20:22.820]  Unlike other flax seed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing
[3:20:22.820 --> 3:20:28.120]  cooler temperatures and longer summer hours, producing the highest quality premium golden
[3:20:28.120 --> 3:20:29.280]  flax seed around.
[3:20:29.280 --> 3:20:34.360]  In addition, we selectively harvest and sort flax seeds by size and weight, keeping only
[3:20:34.360 --> 3:20:38.000]  the best seeds that can produce the highest abundance of omega three.
[3:20:38.000 --> 3:20:41.560]  The result is a delicious, nutty, buttery flavor.
[3:20:41.560 --> 3:20:43.440]  Nature's Gem golden flax is pure.
[3:20:43.440 --> 3:20:46.920]  There is nothing added and nothing taken away and non GMO.

[3:22:02.040 --> 3:22:08.120]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:22:08.120 --> 3:22:12.640]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[3:22:12.640 --> 3:22:13.960]  us would like to see.
[3:22:13.960 --> 3:22:19.120]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[3:22:19.120 --> 3:22:20.120]  of the American people.
[3:22:20.120 --> 3:22:24.880]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[3:22:24.880 --> 3:22:30.000]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[3:22:30.000 --> 3:22:38.120]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[3:22:38.120 --> 3:22:41.680]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[3:22:41.680 --> 3:22:48.560]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[3:22:48.560 --> 3:22:54.040]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com, or download it in super
[3:22:54.040 --> 3:23:01.560]  high quality at prisonplanet.tv, the Obama deception, the people strike back.
[3:23:01.560 --> 3:23:05.680]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that
[3:23:05.680 --> 3:23:09.680]  you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking
[3:23:09.680 --> 3:23:10.680]  the water?
[3:23:10.680 --> 3:23:14.560]  Yes, because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into
[3:23:14.560 --> 3:23:15.560]  the skin.
[3:23:15.560 --> 3:23:20.200]  The KDF dual-media shower filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to
[3:23:20.200 --> 3:23:25.720]  reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold,
[3:23:25.720 --> 3:23:27.040]  algae and fungus.
[3:23:27.040 --> 3:23:31.880]  The KDF dual-media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year whichever
[3:23:31.880 --> 3:23:32.880]  comes first.
[3:23:32.880 --> 3:23:37.080]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine,
[3:23:37.080 --> 3:23:39.160]  iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[3:23:39.160 --> 3:23:40.160]  What about you?

[3:24:00.000 --> 3:24:10.280]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen with Jim Mars here in the studio with us, author
[3:24:10.280 --> 3:24:14.920]  of The Rise of the Fourth Rock, which we have at infowars.com, this is our best-selling
[3:24:14.920 --> 3:24:15.920]  book right now.
[3:24:15.920 --> 3:24:16.920]  It's powerful info.
[3:24:16.920 --> 3:24:18.960]  No, it's not saying the Nazis run things.
[3:24:18.960 --> 3:24:23.960]  The Nazis got it all from the English and the U.S., the system of corporate fascism,
[3:24:23.960 --> 3:24:28.880]  and one of the preeminent 9-11 books, The Terror Conspiracy, Deception 9-11, and The
[3:24:28.880 --> 3:24:33.440]  Loss of Liberty, Jim Mars, all available at infowars.com.
[3:24:33.440 --> 3:24:36.680]  You're going to be speaking tomorrow night at Brave New Books down at the end of the
[3:24:36.680 --> 3:24:40.720]  drag right here in Austin, Texas, BraveNewBooks.com.
[3:24:40.720 --> 3:24:41.720]  That's it.
[3:24:41.720 --> 3:24:43.360]  Hope to see everybody there.
[3:24:43.360 --> 3:24:47.560]  Now, Jim, you've got some new news on Kissinger and the whole thing.
[3:24:47.560 --> 3:24:48.560]  That's right.
[3:24:48.560 --> 3:24:51.840]  We were mentioning Kissinger and you just mentioned my book, The Rise of the Fourth
[3:24:51.840 --> 3:24:56.880]  Reich, which, and I'm glad you clarified this, I'm not trying to say that goose-stepping
[3:24:56.880 --> 3:25:00.360]  Germans have taken over the United States.
[3:25:00.360 --> 3:25:05.480]  It's this moneyed elite, the very people who created communism in Russia, and then grew
[3:25:05.480 --> 3:25:11.160]  fearful because it was going to spread worldwide, so they created national socialism or Nazism
[3:25:11.160 --> 3:25:15.320]  in Germany, and then after the war, they brought them all over here, okay?
[3:25:15.320 --> 3:25:18.360]  And they've been building up a power base ever since.
[3:25:18.360 --> 3:25:19.440]  We're the new empire.
[3:25:19.440 --> 3:25:20.440]  We're the fourth Reich.
[3:25:20.440 --> 3:25:21.640]  That's my argument.
[3:25:21.640 --> 3:25:28.000]  But as a capper of that, last year, Henry Kissinger, who's wanted for war crimes in
[3:25:28.000 --> 3:25:33.800]  a number of countries, honored former President George Herbert Walker Bush and named him as
[3:25:33.800 --> 3:25:40.720]  the man most instrumental for the reunification of Germany and presented him with this big
[3:25:40.720 --> 3:25:43.080]  award.
[3:25:43.080 --> 3:25:48.320]  This was in July of 2008, and guess where they held the honor ceremony?
[3:25:48.320 --> 3:25:57.160]  On the Vonsei, this lake in Germany, where in January, 1942, held the Vonsei conference,
[3:25:57.160 --> 3:26:00.360]  which is where they decided the final solution.
[3:26:00.360 --> 3:26:04.480]  This is when they made the decisions to exterminate the Jews and the Gypsies and the Omicons.
[3:26:04.480 --> 3:26:11.240]  And we know Kissinger signed the CIA memorandums, State Department memorandum 200 to forced
[3:26:11.240 --> 3:26:16.360]  nations that take money to at least reduce their population by half, and they're all
[3:26:16.360 --> 3:26:17.360]  into eugenics.
[3:26:17.360 --> 3:26:19.160]  So, again, we go back to that.
[3:26:19.160 --> 3:26:24.880]  This is the same Nazi program, the same nationals program that they were trying to carry to
[3:26:24.880 --> 3:26:25.880]  fruition.
[3:26:25.880 --> 3:26:26.880]  And you have that from Fox News, of course.
[3:26:26.880 --> 3:26:28.720]  That's right off of Fox News.
[3:26:28.720 --> 3:26:30.560]  This is not deep secret stuff.
[3:26:30.560 --> 3:26:31.560]  My guys are so good.
[3:26:31.560 --> 3:26:33.960]  They've already got it up on screen in there.
[3:26:33.960 --> 3:26:38.840]  For those that don't understand, the eugenicists, that was the mainline scientific rage from
[3:26:38.840 --> 3:26:41.200]  the 1870s to the 1940s.
[3:26:41.200 --> 3:26:42.200]  Right.
[3:26:42.200 --> 3:26:46.080]  In fact, the first eugenic center was set up in this country.
[3:26:46.080 --> 3:26:47.560]  Little Springs, Harvard.
[3:26:47.560 --> 3:26:48.560]  Yeah.
[3:26:48.560 --> 3:26:50.680]  And then from money from Mrs. Edward Harriman.
[3:26:50.680 --> 3:26:56.200]  And I think you should be pointed out that the Harrimans were the mentors and closest
[3:26:56.200 --> 3:26:57.200]  support of the Bushes.
[3:26:57.200 --> 3:27:01.320]  Now, to explain this mainline history books, and you're a big historian on this as well,
[3:27:01.320 --> 3:27:02.320]  so you can speak to it.
[3:27:02.320 --> 3:27:07.080]  I want you to, you know, the Crown King of England was a big Nazi, hung out with them.
[3:27:07.080 --> 3:27:08.960]  They told the Nazis, help fund them.
[3:27:08.960 --> 3:27:11.320]  We're going to let you take over Europe and fight the Russians.
[3:27:11.320 --> 3:27:12.560]  And then Hitler was a bad guy.
[3:27:12.560 --> 3:27:17.920]  The point is, they set him up, and that's why the right deputy furor flew in once the
[3:27:17.920 --> 3:27:18.920]  war started.
[3:27:18.920 --> 3:27:19.920]  Right.
[3:27:19.920 --> 3:27:22.400]  Parachuted into England, Rudolph Hess, and said, why are you doing this?
[3:27:22.400 --> 3:27:23.920]  They grabbed him through him in the tower.
[3:27:23.920 --> 3:27:25.280]  Hitler said, okay, they've betrayed us.
[3:27:25.280 --> 3:27:29.400]  We've still got to beat the Communist and then turned east with Operation Barbarossa.
[3:27:29.400 --> 3:27:34.200]  And so this is the mastermind level, the Milner Group, Lord Milner and others.
[3:27:34.200 --> 3:27:35.200]  Explain that.
[3:27:35.200 --> 3:27:37.200]  Yeah, well, that's how they operate.
[3:27:37.200 --> 3:27:40.280]  In fact, you know, it's this amazing, the current Pope.
[3:27:40.280 --> 3:27:42.480]  Hitler Youth.
[3:27:42.480 --> 3:27:43.480]  It was a Hitler Youth.
[3:27:43.480 --> 3:27:50.080]  Yeah, Joseph Ratzinger in 1944, he was a member of the Hitler Youth, Arnold Schwarzenegger,
[3:27:50.080 --> 3:27:53.280]  the governor of our largest populated state.
[3:27:53.280 --> 3:27:56.400]  His father was a Nazi guy later, a Nazi political leader.
[3:27:56.400 --> 3:27:59.120]  I mean, it kind of makes you wonder who won the war.
[3:27:59.120 --> 3:28:06.760]  And but as you said, their, their ideas of extermination and of killing people and of
[3:28:06.760 --> 3:28:09.320]  sterilization.
[3:28:09.320 --> 3:28:14.200]  All this goes back long before World War II and actually originated with the eugenics
[3:28:14.200 --> 3:28:16.040]  movement in the United States and Britain.
[3:28:16.040 --> 3:28:18.080]  And that's why they brought all the Nazis here after.
[3:28:18.080 --> 3:28:21.480]  It was all, it was all, you can read the writings that we betrayed you.
[3:28:21.480 --> 3:28:22.480]  Yeah.
[3:28:22.480 --> 3:28:23.480]  We love you.
[3:28:23.480 --> 3:28:24.480]  Come to America.
[3:28:24.480 --> 3:28:26.520]  Well, and they'll run NASA, run every major department.
[3:28:26.520 --> 3:28:27.520]  Exactly.
[3:28:27.520 --> 3:28:28.600]  And they did kind of betray them.
[3:28:28.600 --> 3:28:30.480]  But here's the reason, okay.
[3:28:30.480 --> 3:28:38.720]  I quote from Winston Churchill, who was a inner core member of this financial elite.
[3:28:38.720 --> 3:28:42.440]  And he said that we must destroy Germany.
[3:28:42.440 --> 3:28:45.280]  I don't care if a Jesuit priest is in charge.
[3:28:45.280 --> 3:28:47.800]  So in other words, it wasn't Hitler and the Nazis.
[3:28:47.800 --> 3:28:52.640]  The thing, the problem was Alex, they did not want Germany to be the center of power
[3:28:52.640 --> 3:28:56.720]  with industry and science to lead the financial power of the world.
[3:28:56.720 --> 3:28:57.720]  Exactly.
[3:28:57.720 --> 3:29:01.320]  That had been, that had resided first with the British Empire and then they had shared
[3:29:01.320 --> 3:29:04.320]  it with the Rockefellers and the Morgans and the Duponts.
[3:29:04.320 --> 3:29:05.320]  Okay.
[3:29:05.320 --> 3:29:10.560]  So now they had that Anglo-American financial elite that was running everything and they
[3:29:10.560 --> 3:29:12.280]  didn't want to cut Germany in.
[3:29:12.280 --> 3:29:13.280]  Yeah.
[3:29:13.280 --> 3:29:15.520]  So some people email me go, well, you're defending the Nazis?
[3:29:15.520 --> 3:29:16.520]  No.
[3:29:16.520 --> 3:29:17.760]  Use more than two dimensional thinking.
[3:29:17.760 --> 3:29:18.760]  No.
[3:29:18.760 --> 3:29:23.200]  We're saying the globalists on record set them up like a windup toy and that it originated
[3:29:23.200 --> 3:29:25.240]  from the United States and England.
[3:29:25.240 --> 3:29:26.240]  Everything we saw unfold.
[3:29:26.240 --> 3:29:29.760]  Why do you think Hitler let the British army get away at Dunkirk?
[3:29:29.760 --> 3:29:30.760]  Dunkirk.
[3:29:30.760 --> 3:29:31.760]  No, on record.
[3:29:31.760 --> 3:29:33.760]  I mean, he just stopped and let them all go back.
[3:29:33.760 --> 3:29:36.960]  And they only had to deal with the Vici French to basically stand down so they could take
[3:29:36.960 --> 3:29:37.960]  over France.
[3:29:37.960 --> 3:29:42.480]  And the whole idea was is that they were all going to turn and ally and make peace with
[3:29:42.480 --> 3:29:45.560]  each other and then turn against communist, the Soviet Union.
[3:29:45.560 --> 3:29:46.560]  But that was a big setup.
[3:29:46.560 --> 3:29:49.240]  They'd made secret packs that the British and the US broke.
[3:29:49.240 --> 3:29:50.240]  Yeah.
[3:29:50.240 --> 3:29:51.240]  Stay with us.
[3:29:51.240 --> 3:29:52.240]  We'll be right back.
[3:29:52.240 --> 3:29:53.480]  We're on the march.
[3:29:53.480 --> 3:29:55.880]  The Empire's on the run.
[3:29:55.880 --> 3:30:01.840]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:01.840 --> 3:30:05.960]  I'm Todd Davis, CEO of LifeLock and what I'm about to tell you is true.
[3:30:05.960 --> 3:30:10.840]  My real social security number is 457-55-5462.

[3:30:18.360 --> 3:30:20.960]  Every three seconds, someone's identity is stolen.
[3:30:20.960 --> 3:30:22.840]  It's not just the money that's being stolen.
[3:30:22.840 --> 3:30:27.360]  It's your reputation, your credits, and your valuable time to fix the huge mess.

[3:30:58.760 --> 3:31:07.920]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:31:07.920 --> 3:31:14.200]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[3:31:14.200 --> 3:31:15.800]  just as well-funded.
[3:31:15.800 --> 3:31:20.960]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[3:31:20.960 --> 3:31:22.120]  of the American people.
[3:31:22.120 --> 3:31:26.800]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[3:31:26.800 --> 3:31:31.920]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[3:31:31.920 --> 3:31:38.440]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:31:38.440 --> 3:31:40.120]  It's not about left or right.
[3:31:40.120 --> 3:31:42.000]  It's about a one-world government.
[3:31:42.000 --> 3:31:48.920]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[3:31:48.920 --> 3:31:54.400]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com, or download it in Super
[3:31:54.400 --> 3:32:01.680]  High Quality at prismplanet.tv, the Obama deception, the people strike back.
[3:32:01.680 --> 3:32:06.720]  The new multi-polar inline and portable water system, new from hempusa.org.
[3:32:06.720 --> 3:32:11.400]  Now you can restructure and degas your water supply from any source, rendering chemicals
[3:32:11.400 --> 3:32:15.320]  harmless to the human body by polarizing the molecular structure.
[3:32:15.320 --> 3:32:20.320]  Imagine a softer, smoother water with increased oxygen that helps the nervous system in brain.
[3:32:20.320 --> 3:32:24.800]  There are no filters to buy, and it can be taken anywhere making it our number one new
[3:32:24.800 --> 3:32:27.400]  product from hempusa.org.
[3:32:27.400 --> 3:32:32.120]  This water system will de-scale all piping, hot water heaters, and appliances due to heavy
[3:32:32.120 --> 3:32:34.560]  buildup of hard minerals.
[3:32:34.560 --> 3:32:38.160]  Detoxification may result with restructured water by easily entering the fine capillaries
[3:32:38.160 --> 3:32:43.440]  of the human body by dissolving stones and toxins, with extreme positive effects on plants,
[3:32:43.440 --> 3:32:48.560]  vegetables, and fruits, improved taste, color, size, and yield with approximately 30% less
[3:32:48.560 --> 3:32:49.720]  water usage.
[3:32:49.720 --> 3:32:53.400]  There are multiple sizes also available for farms in commercial use.
[3:32:53.400 --> 3:32:58.160]  Visit hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608.
[3:32:58.160 --> 3:33:27.320]  It's 908-691-2608.
[3:33:27.320 --> 3:33:31.440]  By the way, I didn't know we'd launch this except on the Alex Jones channel on YouTube,
[3:33:31.440 --> 3:33:35.640]  a tour of the office that we promised to do for folks.
[3:33:35.640 --> 3:33:36.640]  The new offices.
[3:33:36.640 --> 3:33:39.120]  What do you think of the new offices, Jim?
[3:33:39.120 --> 3:33:40.120]  This is really great.
[3:33:40.120 --> 3:33:46.680]  It's only fitting that a cutting edge news commentator like you have cutting edge production
[3:33:46.680 --> 3:33:47.680]  facilities.
[3:33:47.680 --> 3:33:50.120]  Well, I don't know if it's a cutting edge, but it's certainly better than what we had
[3:33:50.120 --> 3:33:51.120]  before.
[3:33:51.120 --> 3:33:52.120]  You've got more room, don't you?
[3:33:52.120 --> 3:33:55.600]  Yeah, we've got a 7,800 square feet.
[3:33:55.600 --> 3:33:59.440]  A little bit of room next door to us has come open because I thought we'd have room
[3:33:59.440 --> 3:34:03.080]  for our TV studio, but I don't know what I'm going to do, but it's crazy and the economy
[3:34:03.080 --> 3:34:04.080]  is going to hell in a handbasket.
[3:34:04.080 --> 3:34:08.360]  I don't know what to do because I can sit here, I can fund what we're doing, but then
[3:34:08.360 --> 3:34:12.800]  it means more sponsors, more time spent on that, which I'd rather just put the info out,
[3:34:12.800 --> 3:34:16.840]  but then you need the cutting edge and the staff and the people to do it right.
[3:34:16.840 --> 3:34:17.840]  All that takes money.
[3:34:17.840 --> 3:34:18.840]  Well, it sure does.
[3:34:18.840 --> 3:34:21.880]  Well, see, this really bothers me, Alex.
[3:34:21.880 --> 3:34:27.520]  You and me and we could name dozen other people and people are trying to run websites, people
[3:34:27.520 --> 3:34:33.280]  trying to publish books, and we're all struggling, trying to make a living like everybody else.
[3:34:33.280 --> 3:34:39.560]  And we're going up against people with very deep pockets in the irony, and the thing that
[3:34:39.560 --> 3:34:45.000]  really torques me off is those deep pockets are filled with our tax money.
[3:34:45.000 --> 3:34:46.000]  It's our money.
[3:34:46.000 --> 3:34:48.000]  Yeah, we use our money against us.
[3:34:48.000 --> 3:34:49.240]  Yeah, exactly.
[3:34:49.240 --> 3:34:53.160]  And all we want to do is try to bring truth to people, and then people are confused because
[3:34:53.160 --> 3:34:58.120]  they say, well, I hear Alex Jones said this, but then I didn't see that on CNN or Fox,
[3:34:58.120 --> 3:35:02.880]  so it must be just conspiracy theory or fringe information.
[3:35:02.880 --> 3:35:06.920]  And yet, like everything we've talked about since I've come on here, this is all off of
[3:35:06.920 --> 3:35:12.240]  mainstream news sources, I mean, and off the Council on Foreign Relations website.
[3:35:12.240 --> 3:35:14.280]  We're not making this stuff up.
[3:35:14.280 --> 3:35:16.920]  It just always has their spin on it.
[3:35:16.920 --> 3:35:17.920]  Right.
[3:35:17.920 --> 3:35:19.200]  They put their spin on it.
[3:35:19.200 --> 3:35:23.240]  Well, of course, and that's why, you know, when I mentioned the Council on Foreign Relations,
[3:35:23.240 --> 3:35:26.720]  I'll be the first to admit, I don't think everybody on the Council on Foreign Relations
[3:35:26.720 --> 3:35:28.280]  is some kind of sinister conspirator.
[3:35:28.280 --> 3:35:29.280]  No, it's compartmentalizing.
[3:35:29.280 --> 3:35:30.280]  It's very compartmentalizing.
[3:35:30.280 --> 3:35:34.040]  There's an inter-core elite, okay, but they surround themselves.
[3:35:34.040 --> 3:35:35.600]  For example, you know, I could...
[3:35:35.600 --> 3:35:40.320]  They get all the top CEOs and bankers and media people in there so they can watch them
[3:35:40.320 --> 3:35:46.760]  and know what trends are and have people everywhere they can call in favors, and they
[3:35:46.760 --> 3:35:49.520]  propel the careers of... it's not to 5,000 people.
[3:35:49.520 --> 3:35:50.520]  Right.
[3:35:50.520 --> 3:35:55.320]  And then they can nudge them, you know, with their foundations and think tanks and studies,
[3:35:55.320 --> 3:35:57.520]  you know, they say, well, you know, this is what we need to do.
[3:35:57.520 --> 3:35:59.080]  Now, my point is this.
[3:35:59.080 --> 3:36:04.640]  They would argue that, you know, letting the Council on Foreign Relations and their 5,000
[3:36:04.640 --> 3:36:09.720]  elite people run everything is only sensible because that... they know how to handle money.
[3:36:09.720 --> 3:36:11.200]  They know how everything works.
[3:36:11.200 --> 3:36:13.480]  They've got big educations and degrees.
[3:36:13.480 --> 3:36:18.560]  So therefore, this is the path to peace and prosperity.
[3:36:18.560 --> 3:36:25.720]  And I would argue if their plans and their actions are the way to peace and prosperity,
[3:36:25.720 --> 3:36:31.640]  go back and look at history since their inception in 1921, and you'll find we've had two world
[3:36:31.640 --> 3:36:39.640]  wars, a depression, stock market crash, unlimited other wars, political assassinations, their
[3:36:39.640 --> 3:36:41.800]  track record's not very good.
[3:36:41.800 --> 3:36:44.680]  Well, I mean, let's expand on that.
[3:36:44.680 --> 3:36:45.680]  They fund wars.
[3:36:45.680 --> 3:36:50.480]  They kill millions of people, but Brzezinski brags in two books he wrote that he engineered
[3:36:50.480 --> 3:36:51.480]  Polpon.
[3:36:51.480 --> 3:36:52.560]  I mean, he's proud of that.
[3:36:52.560 --> 3:36:53.800]  So they're very wicked at the top.
[3:36:53.800 --> 3:37:01.400]  He also has admitted that as Secretary of State under Jimmy Carter, he sent spies and
[3:37:01.400 --> 3:37:07.880]  provocateurs into Afghanistan to lure the Russians into moving into Afghanistan so they
[3:37:07.880 --> 3:37:08.880]  could have a big...
[3:37:08.880 --> 3:37:10.040]  Yeah, staging terror attacks six months before.
[3:37:10.040 --> 3:37:11.040]  Yeah.
[3:37:11.040 --> 3:37:13.040]  Saving terror attacks to bring in the Russians.
[3:37:13.040 --> 3:37:14.040]  And no, we're not...
[3:37:14.040 --> 3:37:16.640]  He's proud of it because he said that helped defeat the Soviets.
[3:37:16.640 --> 3:37:20.520]  Well, I mean, here's an example of how our detractors work.
[3:37:20.520 --> 3:37:22.480]  Not people that are government operatives or disinfo.
[3:37:22.480 --> 3:37:24.600]  They're out there too, but people that get mad at me.
[3:37:24.600 --> 3:37:29.440]  I've done my own little studies, like I'll be on one of my YouTube videos, and I'll see
[3:37:29.440 --> 3:37:36.040]  a comment going, Alex Jones is a dirtbag piece of filth fed, and I hope he dies, basically.
[3:37:36.040 --> 3:37:38.360]  And I'll link through the guy's website.
[3:37:38.360 --> 3:37:42.720]  And he's a Georgian living in America, and he's like, all hell Georgia, Georgia will
[3:37:42.720 --> 3:37:44.440]  smash Russia.
[3:37:44.440 --> 3:37:45.440]  Russia's the devil.
[3:37:45.440 --> 3:37:48.680]  And we're not talking about the state that houses Atlanta.
[3:37:48.680 --> 3:37:51.480]  We're talking about Georgia and Southern Russia, right?
[3:37:51.480 --> 3:37:52.480]  Yeah, exactly.
[3:37:52.480 --> 3:37:55.320]  They're on the Black Sea.
[3:37:55.320 --> 3:38:00.560]  And I know right away, that person doesn't like me because I reported that it was a US-Israeli
[3:38:00.560 --> 3:38:05.160]  NATO-backed sneak attack on South Ossetia that kicked off a new Cold War.
[3:38:05.160 --> 3:38:06.160]  And so...
[3:38:06.160 --> 3:38:07.320]  But think about his flawed logic.
[3:38:07.320 --> 3:38:15.400]  I'm a fed because I am against the US, Israel and NATO, starting a new Cold War.
[3:38:15.400 --> 3:38:18.520]  If I was a fed, I'd be going with their policies.
[3:38:18.520 --> 3:38:20.520]  But he makes the instant decision.
[3:38:20.520 --> 3:38:24.960]  He knows there's a new world order, so he has to then make me the bad new world order.
[3:38:24.960 --> 3:38:26.560]  Look, I'm no fan of Putin.
[3:38:26.560 --> 3:38:28.360]  I'm no fan of a lot of things going to Russia.
[3:38:28.360 --> 3:38:30.680]  The whole point is, I know the globalists have this master game.
[3:38:30.680 --> 3:38:35.720]  Their policy is to start a war with Russia and start new conflicts, so I'm against that.
[3:38:35.720 --> 3:38:39.760]  It's like I'm not weighing in on the Serb, Muslim, Crow outside.
[3:38:39.760 --> 3:38:45.000]  I just know that the UN went in, used Arabs to attack the Serbs, got the Serbs to move
[3:38:45.000 --> 3:38:48.000]  in and then went in and blew Serbia away.
[3:38:48.000 --> 3:38:53.920]  So again, I'm finding that everybody that attacks me has a little reason because they're
[3:38:53.920 --> 3:38:58.160]  tribal and they think I'm criticizing their little group when, no, everybody would be
[3:38:58.160 --> 3:39:01.960]  better off if the new world order wasn't stirring up regional conflicts and wars.
[3:39:01.960 --> 3:39:07.320]  But that's my point, is that I can link through on somebody's name and look at their page
[3:39:07.320 --> 3:39:10.320]  and then it's always right there why they don't like me.
[3:39:10.320 --> 3:39:11.320]  Right.
[3:39:11.320 --> 3:39:13.160]  But the thing is, they need to look up.
[3:39:13.160 --> 3:39:14.640]  They need to get the bigger picture.
[3:39:14.640 --> 3:39:16.720]  Well, I'm not against Georgia.
[3:39:16.720 --> 3:39:17.720]  No.
[3:39:17.720 --> 3:39:20.240]  I'm not like, you know, I want to destroy Georgia.
[3:39:20.240 --> 3:39:22.680]  I mean, most Georgians aren't glad that they got in that war.
[3:39:22.680 --> 3:39:28.240]  And in the Clinton years, in the Kosovo, by the way, the Kosovo Liberation Army was the
[3:39:28.240 --> 3:39:32.760]  group that we were supporting and how were we supporting it because we were allowing
[3:39:32.760 --> 3:39:41.480]  Al Qaeda to supply arms and training to the Kosovo Liberation Army and in return, we let
[3:39:41.480 --> 3:39:44.360]  them do their drug smuggling through the Balkans.
[3:39:44.360 --> 3:39:47.680]  Now this is all documented, but people don't get told this.
[3:39:47.680 --> 3:39:49.080]  They don't know this.
[3:39:49.080 --> 3:39:52.600]  All they do is listen to the establishment media and then they think, oh, well, it's
[3:39:52.600 --> 3:39:58.520]  this way and they get, and they get totally dragged down into conservative liberal Republican
[3:39:58.520 --> 3:39:59.520]  Democrat.
[3:39:59.520 --> 3:40:01.320]  Yada, yada, yada.
[3:40:01.320 --> 3:40:02.320]  You got to look up, folks.
[3:40:02.320 --> 3:40:05.880]  You got to look up and see the big picture and you got to see who's really running the
[3:40:05.880 --> 3:40:06.880]  show.
[3:40:06.880 --> 3:40:07.880]  You got to look behind the mask.
[3:40:07.880 --> 3:40:13.600]  That's why I really, uh, I've got to compliment you on your new, uh, Obama deception because
[3:40:13.600 --> 3:40:15.120]  it is a deception.
[3:40:15.120 --> 3:40:16.120]  Okay.
[3:40:16.120 --> 3:40:18.600]  And I've, I know people who say, well, I've met Obama.
[3:40:18.600 --> 3:40:19.600]  He's a very nice guy.
[3:40:19.600 --> 3:40:24.120]  Well, I know people who said they met George W. Bush and he's a really nice guy.
[3:40:24.120 --> 3:40:28.360]  And I don't know personally, either one of those fellows, so I'll say maybe they're telling
[3:40:28.360 --> 3:40:29.360]  me the truth.
[3:40:29.360 --> 3:40:33.840]  But what you and I know, and what we're trying to tell people is they're just little puppets.
[3:40:33.840 --> 3:40:34.840]  They're front people.
[3:40:34.840 --> 3:40:40.320]  They're just talking heads that we see on the television and their whole persona is carefully
[3:40:40.320 --> 3:40:42.680]  crafted, right?
[3:40:42.680 --> 3:40:45.040]  They are creations of the media.
[3:40:45.040 --> 3:40:49.880]  Ronald Reagan, we were, we were all told what a fine family man.
[3:40:49.880 --> 3:40:51.920]  He went to church every Sunday and, you know, data done.
[3:40:51.920 --> 3:40:55.040]  Then after he's out of office, we find out that he never went to church.
[3:40:55.040 --> 3:41:01.040]  He had family problems, dysfunctional family and his wife was consulting astrologers.
[3:41:01.040 --> 3:41:08.400]  You know, so it's, it's, these are just little, uh, little scenarios crafted by the corporate
[3:41:08.400 --> 3:41:11.240]  media to, and everybody thinks that's the way it is.
[3:41:11.240 --> 3:41:14.960]  And when you try to tell them it's not, then they get mad at you.
[3:41:14.960 --> 3:41:15.960]  Absolutely.
[3:41:15.960 --> 3:41:19.400]  Um, you've got some other little interesting things to go over there.
[3:41:19.400 --> 3:41:20.680]  What's that little chart you got?
[3:41:20.680 --> 3:41:26.000]  Well, this is a chart of how the organic food industry has been brought in under and bought
[3:41:26.000 --> 3:41:32.520]  up by, uh, the major, uh, agriculture, food corporations, Heinz, Coca-Cola, Kellogg,
[3:41:32.520 --> 3:41:33.520]  Cargill.
[3:41:33.520 --> 3:41:34.520]  Take your time.
[3:41:34.520 --> 3:41:35.520]  Go over that.
[3:41:35.520 --> 3:41:36.520]  Okay.
[3:41:36.520 --> 3:41:37.520]  Well, no, no, no.
[3:41:37.520 --> 3:41:39.640]  The reason I think everybody, especially if you're into health food or if you're into
[3:41:39.640 --> 3:41:43.080]  the food industry or if you're a farmer or know anything about it, you already know
[3:41:43.080 --> 3:41:48.760]  that agribusiness is where it's at and that it's all tied so closely in with corporate,
[3:41:48.760 --> 3:41:50.280]  the corporate food thing.
[3:41:50.280 --> 3:41:56.440]  What I want to tell you about is, uh, HR 875, which is legislation now pending in Congress.
[3:41:56.440 --> 3:42:00.080]  It's known as the Food Safety Modernization Act.
[3:42:00.080 --> 3:42:04.720]  And people need to take a close look at this and I'll be frank, I have not looked at it
[3:42:04.720 --> 3:42:09.040]  even this close, but I know that just from what I've seen and if I glance in over some
[3:42:09.040 --> 3:42:14.200]  of the, uh, paragraphs and some of the clauses in this proposed legislation, essentially it's
[3:42:14.200 --> 3:42:19.520]  going to mean you can't have a garden because they are going to throw so much stuff at you.
[3:42:19.520 --> 3:42:23.280]  You got to show where it's coming from and what it contains and everything else.
[3:42:23.280 --> 3:42:26.400]  And it's going to criminalize, uh, growing a garden.
[3:42:26.400 --> 3:42:27.680]  It's absolutely amazing.
[3:42:27.680 --> 3:42:32.520]  Uh, during World War II, of course, we were all encouraged to grow gardens.
[3:42:32.520 --> 3:42:35.280]  We wanted, we were going to have victory gardens, right?
[3:42:35.280 --> 3:42:39.760]  And well, here we are, we're in a war on drugs and the war on poverty and a war on terrorism.
[3:42:39.760 --> 3:42:42.560]  You know, you think they'd say, let's grow gardens.
[3:42:42.560 --> 3:42:49.720]  Uh, but no, no, this, this legislation pass, the Food Safety Modernization Act, it's going
[3:42:49.720 --> 3:42:55.720]  to leave food production and preparation up to the giant corporations and they can use
[3:42:55.720 --> 3:43:02.120]  this to just shut down small farms and even your own little private garden.
[3:43:02.120 --> 3:43:06.640]  And uh, you can see this happening all over the, and then of course we have the Hope Bill,
[3:43:06.640 --> 3:43:10.320]  which I'm sure you've already talked about, which is the gun control thing.
[3:43:10.320 --> 3:43:14.800]  And it's, you mentioned that earlier, you, it's going to criminalize everybody that owns
[3:43:14.800 --> 3:43:15.800]  a gun.
[3:43:15.800 --> 3:43:16.800]  It's what it's going to do.
[3:43:16.800 --> 3:43:21.520]  And uh, another thing I didn't hear you mention this is that it's going to call for voluntary
[3:43:21.520 --> 3:43:28.360]  physicals and psychological, um, um, profiling, not profiling, but psychological testing.
[3:43:28.360 --> 3:43:29.360]  No, it's involuntary.
[3:43:29.360 --> 3:43:30.600]  Every gunner has to do it.
[3:43:30.600 --> 3:43:32.760]  You've got to, to be able to own your gun.
[3:43:32.760 --> 3:43:33.760]  Okay.
[3:43:33.760 --> 3:43:34.760]  Now, can you picture this?
[3:43:34.760 --> 3:43:35.760]  Okay.
[3:43:35.760 --> 3:43:38.720]  Mr. Jones, uh, do you believe 9-11 was an inside job?
[3:43:38.720 --> 3:43:39.720]  Well, yes.
[3:43:39.720 --> 3:43:43.720]  Uh, there's evidence of, uh, well, we think you need further self-provision.
[3:43:43.720 --> 3:43:45.160]  They've already said that's a male illness.
[3:43:45.160 --> 3:43:46.160]  Yeah.
[3:43:46.160 --> 3:43:47.160]  Yeah.
[3:43:47.160 --> 3:43:48.160]  It's an evil government syndrome.
[3:43:48.160 --> 3:43:49.160]  Somebody came up with that.
[3:43:49.160 --> 3:43:52.080]  Let me go over a key point here, and I want you to cover this.
[3:43:52.080 --> 3:43:58.560]  We know the feds come in with the $787 million stimulus package that I call the federalization
[3:43:58.560 --> 3:43:59.560]  package.
[3:43:59.560 --> 3:44:03.240]  And what they did in that is they come into the counties and cities.
[3:44:03.240 --> 3:44:04.240]  This is on record.
[3:44:04.240 --> 3:44:09.440]  And they say, we want you to make people be licensed to have a garden because they may
[3:44:09.440 --> 3:44:14.280]  grow marijuana and you can't have, I mean, imagine free people, you know, we're prisoners.
[3:44:14.280 --> 3:44:15.280]  Right.
[3:44:15.280 --> 3:44:16.680]  Imagine we're guilty of the privilege innocent.
[3:44:16.680 --> 3:44:17.680]  We can't have a garden.
[3:44:17.680 --> 3:44:19.200]  So here is the Tulsa news.
[3:44:19.200 --> 3:44:25.400]  Now this is Tulsa world, Tulsa city council questions, community gardens, and he goes
[3:44:25.400 --> 3:44:28.960]  on to say community gardens, citizen gardens, you know, how do we know what these people
[3:44:28.960 --> 3:44:30.600]  are going to be growing vegetables?
[3:44:30.600 --> 3:44:31.600]  Maybe there'll be something else.
[3:44:31.600 --> 3:44:35.840]  He said, is there going to be something who inspects what is growing?
[3:44:35.840 --> 3:44:39.240]  And so he wants police to come in and inspect your gardens.
[3:44:39.240 --> 3:44:41.800]  Now, they're bulldozing them all over the country.
[3:44:41.800 --> 3:44:43.400]  They're getting rid of them.
[3:44:43.400 --> 3:44:44.680]  That's being federally pushed.
[3:44:44.680 --> 3:44:48.040]  Now, I'll tell you who's pushing that are the giant food corporations.
[3:44:48.040 --> 3:44:52.560]  Well, no, I mean, animal ID premises ID is all about shutting them down.
[3:44:52.560 --> 3:44:57.360]  They admit that big agorotabit listen to this, this is a town in New York that says mayor
[3:44:57.360 --> 3:45:04.600]  considers options, martial law over political woes, Albany County, same place, martial law.
[3:45:04.600 --> 3:45:07.560]  They said troops.
[3:45:07.560 --> 3:45:10.300]  Notice we heard Blagojevich before he got kicked out saying I'm going to have National
[3:45:10.300 --> 3:45:13.860]  Guard statewide doing gun sweeps in the neighborhoods because of crime.
[3:45:13.860 --> 3:45:18.160]  We're now hearing all these governors, all these county commissioners, mayors saying
[3:45:18.160 --> 3:45:19.160]  we want troops.
[3:45:19.160 --> 3:45:20.160]  We want troops.
[3:45:20.160 --> 3:45:23.360]  Oh, there's a shooting in Alabama, regular army troops.
[3:45:23.360 --> 3:45:30.640]  And in Albany County, local law number a 2009, anyone who goes and purchases ammo will be
[3:45:30.640 --> 3:45:36.000]  registered when they purchase it, a local law for the County of Albany, New York, regulating
[3:45:36.000 --> 3:45:40.200]  the purchase of ammunition in the County of Albany, and it's going to be up on prisonplanet.com
[3:45:40.200 --> 3:45:41.200]  here very soon.
[3:45:41.200 --> 3:45:46.480]  Paul Watson is doing an article and it says being enacted by the county.
[3:45:46.480 --> 3:45:51.560]  And again, we happen to know that these locals are this are in a beta test with Obama through
[3:45:51.560 --> 3:45:53.800]  the stimulus money to do this.
[3:45:53.800 --> 3:45:56.600]  And so they're saying you want the money, you got to do this to start the precedent.
[3:45:56.600 --> 3:46:01.120]  This is happening nationwide, all these towns and cities registering guns and ammo.
[3:46:01.120 --> 3:46:03.160]  Well, let's look at the flip side of this.
[3:46:03.160 --> 3:46:04.800]  People are going to say, well, what can I do about this?
[3:46:04.800 --> 3:46:06.080]  Well, here's what you can do about it.
[3:46:06.080 --> 3:46:08.480]  We need to take control back at the local level.
[3:46:08.480 --> 3:46:13.640]  I believe it's in Montana, County Montana, where the local sheriff, who is the highest
[3:46:13.640 --> 3:46:19.320]  law enforcement official under the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, has publicly sent notice
[3:46:19.320 --> 3:46:23.080]  to federal officials that if they violate the Constitution of the United States, that
[3:46:23.080 --> 3:46:27.320]  his deputies would escort them to the county line because they were no longer welcome in
[3:46:27.320 --> 3:46:28.400]  that county.
[3:46:28.400 --> 3:46:31.160]  This is the type of activity we've got to start moving to.
[3:46:31.160 --> 3:46:34.400]  You've got to gain control over your local representatives and over you.
[3:46:34.400 --> 3:46:38.440]  But what's happened is, is over the years with all this money and now with everything
[3:46:38.440 --> 3:46:43.400]  under Homeland Security and with billions of dollars for our tax money flowing down
[3:46:43.400 --> 3:46:46.920]  into the hands of local officials, they're buying them up, okay?
[3:46:46.920 --> 3:46:49.640]  And they're saying, okay, now here's what you need to do and do this or we're going
[3:46:49.640 --> 3:46:50.640]  to cut you off of the funds.
[3:46:50.640 --> 3:46:52.120]  That's what I wanted you to comment on.
[3:46:52.120 --> 3:46:56.200]  So that, so when you hear about them going after your guns, going after your gardens,
[3:46:56.200 --> 3:47:00.440]  suddenly all over the country, they're raiding Amish for milk, they're for cheese, people
[3:47:00.440 --> 3:47:04.920]  for eggs, watermelons, cops are pulling up and saying, you can't sell eggs on the side
[3:47:04.920 --> 3:47:05.920]  of the road.
[3:47:05.920 --> 3:47:06.920]  They've been ordered to do this.
[3:47:06.920 --> 3:47:10.040]  They are shutting as they implode the economy.
[3:47:10.040 --> 3:47:13.240]  We were 90% rural in the Great Depression, 7 million starved to death according to big
[3:47:13.240 --> 3:47:15.840]  university studies that came out last year.
[3:47:15.840 --> 3:47:19.400]  So instead of now 10% or rural, only half of those are self-sufficient.
[3:47:19.400 --> 3:47:24.160]  We've gone from 90% self-sufficient to 5% self-sufficient with 10% on the land.
[3:47:24.160 --> 3:47:25.280]  And they're shutting them down.
[3:47:25.280 --> 3:47:26.960]  And so they're shutting them down.
[3:47:26.960 --> 3:47:33.880]  As the UN has said in official documents, 97 Beijing China population summit, they will
[3:47:33.880 --> 3:47:35.520]  use food as a weapon.
[3:47:35.520 --> 3:47:40.480]  And so they're consolidating it, the poison GMO food, the people get mad.
[3:47:40.480 --> 3:47:42.160]  Most of the people start buying organic food.
[3:47:42.160 --> 3:47:43.160]  That becomes popular.
[3:47:43.160 --> 3:47:48.440]  That means the standard where it doesn't have to really be organic to have USDA certification.
[3:47:48.440 --> 3:47:50.120]  Private groups come out with their own certifications.
[3:47:50.120 --> 3:47:51.120]  People go to that.
[3:47:51.120 --> 3:47:53.080]  And then they say, you know, we're just shut and all down.
[3:47:53.080 --> 3:47:56.600]  We're just, you know, in the name of some peanut butter problem, you know, that's big
[3:47:56.600 --> 3:48:01.560]  industry doing that or something, or people in Mexico crapping on the lettuce or the spinach.
[3:48:01.560 --> 3:48:05.840]  Again, they use that highly publicized, a few desks or whatever to bring in total control
[3:48:05.840 --> 3:48:08.320]  on the groups that are putting out the best cleanest food.
[3:48:08.320 --> 3:48:10.000]  It's exactly right.
[3:48:10.000 --> 3:48:11.600]  And now they're shutting down.
[3:48:11.600 --> 3:48:16.880]  The last, our last hope, of course, is firearms.
[3:48:16.880 --> 3:48:20.520]  You go back and you read all the way to the writings in the federalist papers.
[3:48:20.520 --> 3:48:23.640]  You read the writings of Thomas Jefferson and George Washington.
[3:48:23.640 --> 3:48:27.960]  They all made it very clear that the purpose of possessing firearms has nothing to do with
[3:48:27.960 --> 3:48:30.760]  hunting or sportsmanship or anything else.
[3:48:30.760 --> 3:48:35.000]  It has the right to protect yourself from a tyrannical government.
[3:48:35.000 --> 3:48:36.000]  Stay there.
[3:48:36.000 --> 3:48:38.680]  We're going to come back from break here in a moment in the final segment and cover a
[3:48:38.680 --> 3:48:39.680]  few other key issues.
[3:48:39.680 --> 3:48:41.200]  You only got to get you in here more often.
[3:48:41.200 --> 3:48:42.600]  This has been a fabulous interview.
[3:48:42.600 --> 3:48:47.040]  Before we do that, though, ladies and gentlemen, speaking of sponsors, I don't endorse a sponsor
[3:48:47.040 --> 3:48:48.040]  unless I believe in it.
[3:48:48.040 --> 3:48:49.440]  And remember, they also make this show possible.
[3:48:49.440 --> 3:48:51.560]  I want to tell you about Home Gain.
[3:48:51.560 --> 3:48:56.640]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, homegain.com.

[3:49:22.480 --> 3:49:23.960]  There are tons of tools to help you.

[3:49:35.880 --> 3:49:38.600]  value before you put it on the market.

[3:49:50.560 --> 3:49:53.560]  Again, that's homegain.com.
[3:49:53.560 --> 3:49:57.880]  One of the other sponsors that makes this show possible is PMemory.net.
[3:49:57.880 --> 3:50:01.920]  You spend all the time listening to the show every day, but how much of the information
[3:50:01.920 --> 3:50:04.680]  can you actually recall?
[3:50:04.680 --> 3:50:10.600]  Place yourself right now and try to recall the show that aired one week ago.
[3:50:10.600 --> 3:50:12.640]  How about two weeks ago?
[3:50:12.640 --> 3:50:16.600]  And if you cannot recall it, then that's my point.
[3:50:16.600 --> 3:50:21.320]  School of Phenomenal Memory, P-Memory, the letter P, memory.net, proven results from
[3:50:21.320 --> 3:50:25.720]  lesson one guaranteed no gimmicks or magic pills, just pure science and real training
[3:50:25.720 --> 3:50:26.720]  that makes sense.

[3:50:51.120 --> 3:50:53.240]  infowars.com.
[3:50:53.240 --> 3:50:57.720]  Final segment of this really great show today with all these informative guests straight
[3:50:57.720 --> 3:51:02.160]  ahead after this quick break, please stay with us.
[3:51:02.160 --> 3:51:05.960]  People around the world are testifying that their cataracts are quickly disappearing like
[3:51:05.960 --> 3:51:07.840]  magic thanks to CANSI.
[3:51:07.840 --> 3:51:13.040]  The original CANSI eye drop used in clinical trials maintains that only the original unadulterated
[3:51:13.040 --> 3:51:17.800]  formula is effective in reducing, reversing, and slowing the occurrence of senile cataract.
[3:51:17.800 --> 3:51:22.280]  CANSI can also assist in lowering the intraocular pressure associated with glaucoma.
[3:51:22.280 --> 3:51:27.240]  CANSI is beneficial for contact lens disorders, to treat corneal disorders, combat eye strain,
[3:51:27.240 --> 3:51:29.560]  in-ease computer vision syndrome, and more.
[3:51:29.560 --> 3:51:33.880]  People enjoying the benefits while using CANSI report no side effects and the drops are gentle
[3:51:33.880 --> 3:51:35.320]  and don't cause eye burning.
[3:51:35.320 --> 3:51:38.960]  With regular use, people using CANSI drops report a difference in their vision in as
[3:51:38.960 --> 3:51:43.400]  little as 30 days and some have their cataracts completely disappear within months.
[3:51:43.400 --> 3:51:51.680]  CANSI, that's CAN-letter C, is available now by calling 888-212-8871, that's 888-212-8871,
[3:51:51.680 --> 3:51:57.120]  or order online at Nutramedical.com, that's NUTRImedical.com, your source for the most
[3:51:57.120 --> 3:52:02.560]  powerful nutraceuticals and wellness protocols from a doctor you can trust.
[3:52:02.560 --> 3:52:08.640]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:52:08.640 --> 3:52:13.000]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all
[3:52:13.000 --> 3:52:14.480]  of us would like to see.
[3:52:14.480 --> 3:52:19.600]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[3:52:19.600 --> 3:52:21.040]  of the American people.
[3:52:21.040 --> 3:52:22.760]  Well Obama's already fudging.
[3:52:22.760 --> 3:52:23.760]  Yeah.
[3:52:23.760 --> 3:52:25.360]  Fudged since day one in this election.
[3:52:25.360 --> 3:52:30.440]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[3:52:30.440 --> 3:52:38.560]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:52:38.560 --> 3:52:42.120]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one world government.
[3:52:42.120 --> 3:52:49.040]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[3:52:49.040 --> 3:52:54.640]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super high
[3:52:54.640 --> 3:53:01.800]  quality at prisonplanet.tv, the Obama deception, the people strike back.
[3:53:01.800 --> 3:53:05.240]  Attention gardeners, this is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[3:53:05.240 --> 3:53:09.840]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers and herbs.
[3:53:09.840 --> 3:53:13.360]  It's called protogrow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems
[3:53:13.360 --> 3:53:18.040]  to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and like conditions.
[3:53:18.040 --> 3:53:21.520]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[3:53:21.520 --> 3:53:25.680]  Protogrow's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases
[3:53:25.680 --> 3:53:29.120]  bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[3:53:29.120 --> 3:53:32.360]  Protogrow works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock
[3:53:32.360 --> 3:53:34.880]  the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[3:53:34.880 --> 3:53:37.960]  Protogrow's full spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary
[3:53:37.960 --> 3:53:42.080]  taste enough to 10 times the nutritional value, and if you want to double or triple the potency
[3:53:42.080 --> 3:53:44.000]  of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[3:53:44.000 --> 3:53:47.480]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[3:53:47.480 --> 3:53:51.160]  GCN listeners who want to grow dirt-cheafed superfoods should visit the protogrow website
[3:53:51.160 --> 3:53:52.160]  at growlikecrazy.com.
[3:53:52.160 --> 3:53:58.160]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[3:53:58.160 --> 3:54:21.960]  Final segment with Jim Mars here in studio and the transmission is over until the Sunday
[3:54:21.960 --> 3:54:22.960]  live.
[3:54:22.960 --> 3:54:23.960]  4-6pm central standard time and the syndicated transmission we do, five days a week, four
[3:54:23.960 --> 3:54:24.960]  hours a day is enough.
[3:54:24.960 --> 3:54:25.960]  What's five times four?
[3:54:25.960 --> 3:54:26.960]  That's 20 hours.
[3:54:26.960 --> 3:54:30.240]  That's a lot of few hours a week.
[3:54:30.240 --> 3:54:34.560]  I guess that's 22 hours a week of live radio.
[3:54:34.560 --> 3:54:35.560]  I don't see how you do it.
[3:54:35.560 --> 3:54:36.560]  Oh, I love it.
[3:54:36.560 --> 3:54:39.160]  We've got a great crew in here that makes it all possible.
[3:54:39.160 --> 3:54:40.160]  You've got a new book out.
[3:54:40.160 --> 3:54:43.760]  We're not carrying it yet, but we do have your Rise of the Fourth.
[3:54:43.760 --> 3:54:48.000]  I think it's your best book and the other one that we have it in 4Wars.com, but Jim
[3:54:48.000 --> 3:54:51.880]  Mars above top secret undercover mysteries of the digital age.
[3:54:51.880 --> 3:54:55.360]  They sent us a copy of this, your publisher, and it was a great read because I could just
[3:54:55.360 --> 3:54:57.840]  read a chapter every night before I went to bed, covers a lot of subjects.
[3:54:57.840 --> 3:55:04.880]  Now, in the time we have left, when you came in with rave reviews about it, why did you
[3:55:04.880 --> 3:55:06.720]  like the Obama deception?
[3:55:06.720 --> 3:55:13.280]  Oh, well, I would recommend everyone get a copy of the Obama deception because you're
[3:55:13.280 --> 3:55:21.000]  either already kind of anti-Obama, in which case you need to do your homework and get
[3:55:21.000 --> 3:55:26.360]  your ammunition for your arguments, or you're pro-Obama, and you'd really definitely need
[3:55:26.360 --> 3:55:31.480]  to see the Obama deception because you've been deluded and you've been fooled.
[3:55:31.480 --> 3:55:32.840]  And folks, let me tell you something.
[3:55:32.840 --> 3:55:35.840]  This is the same thing that's gone on over the past eight years.
[3:55:35.840 --> 3:55:42.320]  You had conservative Republicans who voted and were staunchly behind everything George
[3:55:42.320 --> 3:55:46.720]  W. Bush did because they thought he was a good constitutional conservative.
[3:55:46.720 --> 3:55:54.000]  They didn't realize that the term neocon actually meant national socialist, okay?
[3:55:54.000 --> 3:55:58.520]  Now the same thing's happening in reverse because now we got all these people who think
[3:55:58.520 --> 3:56:02.960]  that Obama is going to bring us some sort of change and we're going to get away from
[3:56:02.960 --> 3:56:03.960]  this national socialism.
[3:56:03.960 --> 3:56:06.520]  And he's just continuing the exact agenda with different wind addresses.
[3:56:06.520 --> 3:56:07.520]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[3:56:07.520 --> 3:56:11.000]  And so now we've swapped national socialism for Marxist socialism.
[3:56:11.000 --> 3:56:15.640]  In fact, I'm sure you saw Newsweek, who carried a big cover here a week or so ago, said,
[3:56:15.640 --> 3:56:17.120]  now we're all socialists.
[3:56:17.120 --> 3:56:21.120]  Well, when did we get to vote for being socialists is what I want to know.
[3:56:21.120 --> 3:56:23.960]  So people need to understand they need to see the Obama deception.
[3:56:23.960 --> 3:56:26.720]  Plus it's not even real socialism.
[3:56:26.720 --> 3:56:28.520]  It's all going to the bankers.
[3:56:28.520 --> 3:56:29.520]  Right.
[3:56:29.520 --> 3:56:30.520]  Right.
[3:56:30.520 --> 3:56:31.520]  Fascism.
[3:56:31.520 --> 3:56:33.760]  Well, this is what happened in communist Russia in the Soviet Union.
[3:56:33.760 --> 3:56:36.160]  They said everything was in the name of the people.
[3:56:36.160 --> 3:56:37.880]  And yet the people never benefited.
[3:56:37.880 --> 3:56:41.400]  It all went to the Politburo and the Central Committee.
[3:56:41.400 --> 3:56:42.960]  And it's the same thing over here.
[3:56:42.960 --> 3:56:44.120]  I mean, come on.
[3:56:44.120 --> 3:56:48.240]  People need to just wise up, you know, and then you say, well, how do you do that?
[3:56:48.240 --> 3:56:53.840]  Well, number one, turn off your TV and spread the word about and talk to people.
[3:56:53.840 --> 3:56:59.400]  Tell folks your website, Jamars.com, J-I-M-M-A-R-R-S.com.
[3:56:59.400 --> 3:57:04.480]  I try to put up articles that you probably never see on the corporate mainstream mass
[3:57:04.480 --> 3:57:05.480]  media.
[3:57:05.480 --> 3:57:12.000]  And of course, between that and going to Info Wars, that ought to give them a pretty good
[3:57:12.000 --> 3:57:13.960]  idea of what's going on.
[3:57:13.960 --> 3:57:17.760]  I want to thank you for reminding me of that Texas State Police that was a public report,
[3:57:17.760 --> 3:57:20.520]  just as bad as the Missouri Mayak Report.
[3:57:20.520 --> 3:57:23.440]  It's good to see people angry about this, though, and saying, hey, we're not going to
[3:57:23.440 --> 3:57:25.200]  put up with your demonization.
[3:57:25.200 --> 3:57:26.880]  People that are doing this, they're the tyrants.
[3:57:26.880 --> 3:57:27.880]  They're the traders.
[3:57:27.880 --> 3:57:30.480]  They're the people selling out what our country is based on.
[3:57:30.480 --> 3:57:31.480]  That's right.
[3:57:31.480 --> 3:57:35.520]  I would like to grab every law enforcement officer in Texas and say, listen, buddy, I'm
[3:57:35.520 --> 3:57:36.720]  on your side.
[3:57:36.720 --> 3:57:38.520]  I am not a terrorist, okay?
[3:57:38.520 --> 3:57:43.320]  But likewise, I don't want you operating as some kind of thug for the international
[3:57:43.320 --> 3:57:48.680]  bankers who want to come and tell me I can't grow a garden and I can't own a gun and, you
[3:57:48.680 --> 3:57:52.400]  know, et cetera, et cetera, you know, because, hey, folks, we're all in this together.
[3:57:52.400 --> 3:57:55.280]  The attorney always comes to your door in a uniform with the police and military going
[3:57:55.280 --> 3:57:56.280]  along with this.
[3:57:56.280 --> 3:57:57.280]  They're going to help destroy this nation.
[3:57:57.280 --> 3:57:59.560]  What time are you speaking tomorrow at Brave New Books in Austin?
[3:57:59.560 --> 3:58:03.600]  Seven o'clock tomorrow at Brave New Books right across from the university.
[3:58:03.600 --> 3:58:05.680]  And your talks on your new book about top secret?
[3:58:05.680 --> 3:58:09.880]  No, this is the topic you don't want to talk about.
[3:58:09.880 --> 3:58:10.880]  So we won't mention it.
[3:58:10.880 --> 3:58:11.880]  The little green men?
[3:58:11.880 --> 3:58:15.960]  Well, I've been down here several times and I've talked about the rise of the Fourth
[3:58:15.960 --> 3:58:16.960]  Reich.
[3:58:16.960 --> 3:58:17.960]  I've talked about the...
[3:58:17.960 --> 3:58:18.960]  No, no, no.
[3:58:18.960 --> 3:58:20.200]  I mean, you talk about the areas that can be proven, though.
[3:58:20.200 --> 3:58:21.200]  It's very interesting.
[3:58:21.200 --> 3:58:22.200]  Exactly.
[3:58:22.200 --> 3:58:25.360]  But everybody said, because every now and then, something come up about UFOs and they say,
[3:58:25.360 --> 3:58:28.480]  everybody demanded I come back down here and explain to them what's true.
[3:58:28.480 --> 3:58:29.480]  All right.
[3:58:29.480 --> 3:58:30.480]  We're out of time.
[3:58:30.480 --> 3:58:31.480]  Jim Marsh, thank you.
[3:58:31.480 --> 3:58:32.480]  Bye.
[3:58:32.480 --> 3:58:33.480]  You bet.
[3:58:33.480 --> 3:58:34.480]  I'll stay there for a second.
[3:58:34.480 --> 3:58:35.480]  Folks, retransmission starts in 70 seconds, one place.
[3:58:35.480 --> 3:58:38.360]  Infowars.com on the web of the streams and AM and FM dials.
[3:58:38.360 --> 3:58:39.880]  See you Sunday live, 4 to 6 p.m.
[3:58:39.880 --> 3:58:40.880]  God bless you all.
[3:58:40.880 --> 3:58:41.880]  I'm Crib.
[3:58:41.880 --> 3:58:47.880]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[3:58:47.880 --> 3:58:51.880]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[3:58:51.880 --> 3:58:52.880]  Hello, friends.
[3:58:52.880 --> 3:58:53.880]  This is Alex Jones.
[3:58:53.880 --> 3:58:57.480]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's more
[3:58:57.480 --> 3:58:58.480]  important than ever.
[3:58:58.480 --> 3:59:01.440]  We need to be independent and food and water is the key.
[3:59:01.440 --> 3:59:04.280]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line until you have your own bread.
[3:59:04.280 --> 3:59:08.080]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family.
[3:59:08.080 --> 3:59:10.520]  In any emergency, if you simply prepare.
[3:59:10.520 --> 3:59:13.800]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation, but you.
[3:59:13.800 --> 3:59:18.120]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift storable food that's safe from E. coli,
[3:59:18.120 --> 3:59:21.840]  salmonella genetic alteration, or Chinese imports, and they do it at almost half the
[3:59:21.840 --> 3:59:24.080]  cost of last year's grocery prices.
