[00:00.000 --> 00:04.000]  He will fight a democratic plan to bail out the United States automakers.
[00:04.000 --> 00:12.500]  Richard Shelby of Alabama and other GOP lawmakers raise in doubts about whether the plan will pass in this week's post-election session.
[00:12.500 --> 00:17.000]  They've got good workers, but I don't believe they've got good management. They don't innovate.
[00:17.000 --> 00:20.500]  They're a dinosaur, in a sense, and I hate to see this.
[00:20.500 --> 00:23.000]  Shelby appeared on NBC's Meet the Press.
[00:23.000 --> 00:27.000]  Shelby is the top Republican in the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee.
[00:27.000 --> 00:36.000]  He says it would be a mistake to use any of the $700 billion in the Wall Street Rescue to help the automakers survive the current crisis.
[00:36.000 --> 00:39.000]  A strong earthquake has struck eastern Indonesia.
[00:39.000 --> 00:44.000]  The US Geological Survey called it a 7.5 magnitude quake.
[00:44.000 --> 00:48.000]  A tsunami warning that was issued right after the quake has now been lifted.
[00:48.000 --> 00:51.000]  This is IRN USA Radio News.
[00:51.000 --> 00:54.000]  Hi, this is Dale Denton from Maryland.
[00:54.000 --> 00:57.000]  I came from a real estate background.
[00:57.000 --> 01:02.000]  My traditional business, my overhead, was enormous and a downturn put me out of business.
[01:02.000 --> 01:10.000]  The problem with my traditional business was that my overhead grew as the company grew and it eventually grew to about a half million dollars a month,
[01:10.000 --> 01:13.000]  which I couldn't sustain during every session and a downturn.
[01:13.000 --> 01:17.000]  I found myself near 50 and having to start over with no retirement plan.
[01:17.000 --> 01:26.000]  I've been working in a three-step plan for just over two and a half years, something under three years, and the great thing about the Andy Willoughby three-step plan,
[01:26.000 --> 01:31.000]  the minimum investment compared to the return that I got was just awesome.
[01:31.000 --> 01:34.000]  The three-step plan has given me my life back.
[01:34.000 --> 01:36.000]  Hi, how in the world are you anyway?
[01:36.000 --> 01:40.000]  This is Andy Willoughby with the three-step plan home business system.

[01:53.000 --> 01:58.000]  If President-elect Barack Obama names Hillary Clinton to be his Secretary of State,
[01:58.000 --> 02:02.000]  at least one Republican senator said it would be a very good selection.
[02:02.000 --> 02:06.000]  Arizona's John Kyle is the second-ranking Republican in the Senate.
[02:06.000 --> 02:10.000]  He says Clinton's got the experience and the temperament for it.
[02:10.000 --> 02:13.000]  He says the New York senator would be well-received around the world.
[02:13.000 --> 02:23.000]  Comer wins in Southern California, giving some relief to firefighters battling wildfires that have destroyed hundreds of homes and forced thousands of residents to flee.
[02:23.000 --> 02:30.000]  Angela Garbiso with the Orange County Fire Department says they're not only dealing with the fire, but with the evacuees.
[02:30.000 --> 02:37.000]  We've had very good responses as far as people cooperating, and we continue to just make sure that they have their needs met.
[02:37.000 --> 02:47.000]  The fires in Los Angeles Riverside, Orange and Santa Barbara counties have blackened some 30 square miles and destroyed more than 800 mobile homes, houses, and apartments since Thursday night.
[02:47.000 --> 02:52.000]  For the latest news and analysis, log on to ironnews.com.
[02:52.000 --> 02:56.000]  I'm Errol Squires, inventor of Relief One-Day Cold Sir Symptom Treatment.
[02:56.000 --> 03:01.000]  I invented Relief because I wanted a very effective, natural treatment for cold sores that work really fast.
[03:01.000 --> 03:05.000]  Relief works so well, and so fast for me, my family, and friends.
[03:05.000 --> 03:08.000]  I wanted to help other people who suffer from cold sores.
[03:08.000 --> 03:11.000]  I think people are smart enough to know if something works.
[03:11.000 --> 03:15.000]  If you suffer from cold sores, try Relief and find out if it works for you.
[03:15.000 --> 03:22.000]  Relief is comprised of botanical extracts and is guaranteed by Relief Now at all major stores.
[03:22.000 --> 03:26.000]  Barack Obama has stepped down from the U.S. Senate.
[03:26.000 --> 03:31.000]  The president-elect did so today, and has announced three more appointments to his White House staff.
[03:31.000 --> 03:36.000]  Pete Rouse, who headed Obama's Senate staff, will serve as senior adviser.
[03:36.000 --> 03:40.000]  Monal Satvin and Jim Messina have both been named deputy chiefs of staff.
[03:40.000 --> 03:49.000]  World leaders said they're going to keep a sharper eye out for signs of trouble and give bigger roles to fast-rising nations as they try to weather through the global economic crisis.
[03:49.000 --> 03:52.000]  They've put off the hardest decisions until next time.
[03:52.000 --> 03:55.000]  A report from IRN-USA correspondent Connie Lawn.
[03:55.000 --> 03:58.000]  President Bush called the meeting productive.
[03:58.000 --> 04:03.000]  He said the delegates agreed on the need for greater transparency and accountability,
[04:03.000 --> 04:07.000]  so investors and regulators can know the true value of their investments.
[04:07.000 --> 04:12.000]  The officials studied a nine-page document, which had been prepared in advance.
[04:12.000 --> 04:16.000]  They also agreed to hold a second such summit at the end of April.
[04:16.000 --> 04:22.000]  President Bush said he will be retired by then, but promises Barack Obama and his team are well-briefed.
[04:22.000 --> 04:26.000]  The president ended his statements by poignantly saying goodbye.
[04:26.000 --> 04:30.000]  Connie Lawn, IRN-USA Radio News, Washington.
[04:30.000 --> 04:36.000]  A 20-year-old New York man who cops as a crime to rob a jewelry store is facing attempted murder charges.
[04:36.000 --> 04:41.000]  A security guard was shot when he attempted to stop the robbery. He's expected to survive.
[04:41.000 --> 04:48.000]  In space shuttle endeavor, getting ready to meet up with the International Space Station 220 miles high in the sky.

[06:24.000 --> 06:32.000]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[06:32.000 --> 06:40.000]  Welcome and thank you for joining us on this live Sunday edition already the 16th of November 2008.
[06:40.000 --> 06:46.000]  I appreciate the listeners of this radio broadcast, especially during NFL football season.
[06:46.000 --> 06:52.000]  You tune into this transmission who actually care about the future of the country and the world.
[06:52.000 --> 06:57.000]  More than they care about bread and circuses.
[06:57.000 --> 07:02.000]  Not attacking football, ladies and gentlemen, we just have a criminal world government openly set up,
[07:02.000 --> 07:08.000]  world government openly being announced, the bankruptcy of our families, our community, our country,
[07:08.000 --> 07:16.000]  mass depression by design being orchestrated by the new world order criminal syndicate so they can fully bankrupt our society.
[07:16.000 --> 07:24.000]  And the average American is starting to get a little bit more concerned about it, but still they're more upset about their football team losing
[07:24.000 --> 07:31.000]  than the fact that we have a eugenicist government that is putting poisons in the water by design to sterilize us
[07:31.000 --> 07:35.000]  and brain damages and yes, I have the government documents.
[07:35.000 --> 07:38.000]  Yes, I've made films on the subject. Yes, they're really doing it.
[07:38.000 --> 07:43.000]  Yes, truth is stranger than fiction.
[07:43.000 --> 07:49.000]  I have a lot of news here to cover today. I'm going to cover a lot of news on the radio show today on this abbreviated Sunday edition.
[07:49.000 --> 07:53.000]  I do do four hours weekdays coming on Sundays and do two hours.
[07:53.000 --> 07:55.000]  And again, I appreciate you joining us.
[07:55.000 --> 07:58.000]  I have two large stacks of news here. Here's type of headlines.
[07:58.000 --> 08:03.000]  I have fake TV news widespread and undisclosed.
[08:03.000 --> 08:11.000]  Now, about four years ago, the congressional budget office did a big investigation and said the White House alone was
[08:11.000 --> 08:15.000]  in one purchase program buying $1.8 billion a year in fake news,
[08:15.000 --> 08:22.000]  but total the White House was spending more than $10 billion a year for fake news.
[08:22.000 --> 08:29.000]  Now, these are news packages. They have the local news readers on radio, TV, and in print.
[08:29.000 --> 08:33.000]  They change them up just a little bit, put their name in, put the locale in.
[08:33.000 --> 08:39.000]  And if you go read the Center for Media and Democracies report, the congressional budget offices reports on this
[08:39.000 --> 08:43.000]  and the last four years, there's a new one out just last Friday.
[08:43.000 --> 08:46.000]  You will see what the news reports are.
[08:46.000 --> 08:51.000]  It's the announcement that it's the law to take vaccines and that you'll be arrested if you don't.
[08:51.000 --> 08:58.000]  There is no law. That's just one of thousands of things the government pays for.
[08:58.000 --> 09:04.000]  Private corporations pay for fake news too. And this is the big dirty secret of radio and TV.
[09:04.000 --> 09:13.000]  This is the big dirty, big, big, big, big dirty secret because most of it is government.
[09:13.000 --> 09:21.000]  A large portion though is of course a large portion, around 30% depending on which study you look at,
[09:21.000 --> 09:26.000]  is corporations, mainly drug companies.
[09:26.000 --> 09:31.000]  So you'll hear a newscast telling you how great it is to join the military.
[09:31.000 --> 09:37.000]  Or you'll hear a newscast about how great it is that the police are setting up warrantless checkpoints everywhere.
[09:37.000 --> 09:44.000]  Well, the state police in major states have budgets and they pay to have that on the air.
[09:44.000 --> 09:47.000]  And this is how America really works.
[09:47.000 --> 09:52.000]  So this is a big issue. This is a very big issue.
[09:52.000 --> 09:55.000]  Fake TV news widespread and undisclosed.
[09:55.000 --> 10:03.000]  The story's up on infowars.com from the Center for Media and Democracy. It says investigators captured 77 TV stations
[10:03.000 --> 10:12.000]  actively disguising sponsored content from companies including General Motors, Intel, Pfizer, Capital One,
[10:12.000 --> 10:15.000]  to make it look like their own reporting.
[10:15.000 --> 10:22.000]  More than one-third of the time stations aired fake news stories in their entirety as their own opening reporting.
[10:22.000 --> 10:27.000]  Yeah, I remember three years ago I saw one and I went and pulled up the congressional report and they didn't catch all of it,
[10:27.000 --> 10:29.000]  but it was in there.
[10:29.000 --> 10:36.000]  And I saw these newscasts locally, but I saw the same newscast all across the nation thanks to YouTube and Google.
[10:36.000 --> 10:45.000]  I could Google that headline that was on a local TV station here in Austin, the name of the piece.
[10:45.000 --> 10:53.000]  And then it was Medical Watch, and then I could go and see that all across the country.
[10:53.000 --> 10:56.000]  And I went, oh, bingo, that was paid for, and then boom, sure enough.
[10:56.000 --> 10:58.000]  Telling you mercury is good for your brain.
[10:58.000 --> 11:01.000]  I mean, come on, folks.
[11:01.000 --> 11:05.000]  The government is paying to tell you that mercury is good for your brain.
[11:05.000 --> 11:10.000]  It's all off the charts.
[11:10.000 --> 11:19.000]  I mean, you understand how deep you are under propaganda, you understand how thick it is, how serious it is, how pervasive it is,
[11:19.000 --> 11:26.000]  I mean, how un-American this is, how dangerous and deceptive, and I would add, illegal.
[11:26.000 --> 11:34.000]  The courts have found, Congress has reported, that every time the executive branch or any of the agencies,
[11:34.000 --> 11:40.000]  Department of Education, billions on fake news and propaganda, Department of Labor, billions.
[11:40.000 --> 11:44.000]  I mean, just the executive alone, 10 billion a year.
[11:44.000 --> 11:52.000]  And so when you see newscasts telling you Barack Obama's the savior and loves you and lying to you, a lot of it was paid for.
[11:52.000 --> 11:59.000]  When you saw news reports about how great torture was and how George Bush is mankind's savior,
[11:59.000 --> 12:04.000]  or when you see news reports about how gun ownership is bad, most of those are paid for.
[12:04.000 --> 12:11.000]  The government takes your money, my money, and they send it back to the local TV, radio and news prep.
[12:11.000 --> 12:13.000]  It's mainly TV.
[12:13.000 --> 12:15.000]  They even do it on national TV.
[12:15.000 --> 12:19.000]  They even pay millions of dollars per movie.
[12:19.000 --> 12:23.000]  Here's an example of the movie Anger Management.
[12:23.000 --> 12:30.000]  It came out a few years ago and you kept seeing Army of One billboards in the background and pro joined the Army messages in the film.
[12:30.000 --> 12:31.000]  You can go pull up the number.
[12:31.000 --> 12:32.000]  It was in the news.
[12:32.000 --> 12:38.000]  It was several million dollars and that was more than two mil paid just to have that in there.
[12:38.000 --> 12:49.000]  So start being aware that you are bombarded by propaganda on every single front everywhere.
[12:49.000 --> 12:53.000]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, I have probably 60, 70 articles in front of me.
[12:53.000 --> 12:58.000]  Each one is just as important as what I just covered here.
[12:58.000 --> 13:00.000]  And that's my great frustration.
[13:00.000 --> 13:10.000]  That's why I start yelling and screaming and getting angry because I mean, I could spend the next two hours just on this explaining how historically this is so horrible and how dangerous this is.
[13:10.000 --> 13:21.000]  Now, they call it product placement, but I call it propaganda placement when government is 70% or more of the spending.
[13:21.000 --> 13:30.000]  That's why almost every Hollywood movie, you see a movie that's got anti gun messages.
[13:30.000 --> 13:34.000]  It was paid for because the government is rogue is criminal.
[13:34.000 --> 13:36.000]  They want to rob your pension funds.
[13:36.000 --> 13:38.000]  They want to enslave you.
[13:38.000 --> 13:39.000]  They want to control you.
[13:39.000 --> 13:45.000]  They want to dumb you down so they have a move to demonize gun ownership.
[13:45.000 --> 13:55.000]  They want to train you to answer police questions to be pulled over at checkpoints to have secret police spying on you to have interaction with the police.
[13:55.000 --> 14:00.000]  So they're brainwashing the cops and everybody else with all these SWAT team shows and movies and shows like cops.
[14:00.000 --> 14:01.000]  They only show you white trash.
[14:01.000 --> 14:02.000]  We're always guilty.
[14:02.000 --> 14:06.000]  All of this is programming.
[14:06.000 --> 14:09.000]  The cops are brainwashed, the public's brainwashed.
[14:09.000 --> 14:10.000]  Meanwhile, criminals run the government.
[14:10.000 --> 14:23.000]  We're going over a cliff and the public's been fooled to think at least some of them that Barack Obama is real change because he is a Democrat or because he's got darker skin than George Bush.
[14:23.000 --> 14:30.000]  Meanwhile, the Barack Obama has announced they're continuing all the warrantless wiretapping of spying on Americans.
[14:30.000 --> 14:35.000]  They've now announced and I have the video clip from CNN here in front of me.
[14:35.000 --> 14:40.000]  I'll give you the headline later if you want to pull up the actual video clip and the story that accompanies it.
[14:40.000 --> 14:42.000]  It's up on prisonplanet.com right now.
[14:42.000 --> 14:47.000]  And they just said, yeah, the Patriot Act will now be used in all non-terror related.
[14:47.000 --> 14:58.000]  There will be no due process, no bill of rights for general citizens, and the government will spy on you in non-terror related cases, even non-crime related cases.
[14:58.000 --> 15:07.000]  And then I just happened to turn on PBS today and I probably watched maybe an hour of TV a day when I'm exercising in the garage on the treadmill or on the stair step.
[15:07.000 --> 15:18.000]  And I watched 30 minutes of some show called Fueled on PBS, KLRU here in Austin, but it was a national show with Robert Kennedy Jr. and the rest of them up there.
[15:18.000 --> 15:22.000]  And he just said point blank, we're going to take the people.
[15:22.000 --> 15:24.000]  He's going to be in the Obama administration.
[15:24.000 --> 15:29.000]  Everybody losing their job and making part of new environmental cops and tattletale squads.
[15:29.000 --> 15:30.000]  I mean, there it was.
[15:30.000 --> 15:34.000]  I can't even turn the TV on without just propaganda everywhere.
[15:34.000 --> 15:36.000]  Look, there's a powerful elite.
[15:36.000 --> 15:39.000]  They have high tech advertising technologies.
[15:39.000 --> 15:46.000]  They have neutralized the public where the public is drooling and they're moving against us to take all your pension funds and attacks every action you take.
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  Okay, we're going to come back, cover it all.
[15:48.000 --> 15:49.000]  You don't want to miss this broadcast.

[17:30.000 --> 17:39.000]  In fact, they guarantee that every single person will be able to memorize any type of information including entire books after they complete just 60 lessons.
[17:39.000 --> 17:45.000]  And they offer a no questions asked, no time limit, money-back guarantee.
[17:45.000 --> 17:46.000]  Wow, what's the website?
[17:46.000 --> 17:52.000]  Now, don't forget, it's pmemory.net, the letter pmemory.net.
[17:54.000 --> 17:56.000]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[17:56.000 --> 18:02.000]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[18:02.000 --> 18:06.000]  That's right. Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[18:06.000 --> 18:13.000]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[18:13.000 --> 18:19.000]  The truth be told, gold and silver is outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs.
[18:19.000 --> 18:21.000]  Yet no word about IRAs.
[18:21.000 --> 18:26.000]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[18:26.000 --> 18:32.000]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[18:32.000 --> 18:37.000]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[18:37.000 --> 18:40.000]  Call 800-686-2237.
[18:40.000 --> 18:42.000]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[18:42.000 --> 18:46.000]  Call 800-686-2237.
[18:46.000 --> 19:13.000]  That's 1800-686-2237.

[19:30.000 --> 19:34.000]  a solar hand crank flashlight, radio, cell phone charger, and much more.

[19:56.000 --> 20:01.000]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[20:06.000 --> 20:09.000]  All right, welcome back. Your call is coming up in the next segment.
[20:09.000 --> 20:16.000]  At 877-590-5525.
[20:16.000 --> 20:20.000]  One line open at 877-590-5525.
[20:20.000 --> 20:21.000]  We'll get to everybody.
[20:21.000 --> 20:25.000]  From Canada, Texas, New Hampshire, Las Vegas, 10-0-C.
[20:25.000 --> 20:27.000]  I see you all there.
[20:29.000 --> 20:36.000]  All right, so the government, which isn't the government, it's been taken over by private international organizations.
[20:36.000 --> 20:43.000]  That's what the New World Order is. It's global government of and by a select group of 14100 controlling central governments.
[20:46.000 --> 20:53.000]  They run around purchasing lies to put on the news that checkpoints are good.
[20:53.000 --> 20:55.000]  Secret arrest is good.
[20:55.000 --> 21:01.000]  Body scanners that scan your neck and body and store it on government computers at airports is freedom.
[21:01.000 --> 21:09.000]  The CPS is good kidnapping children with no due process and covering up the fact that because they're advertisers,
[21:09.000 --> 21:17.000]  the news can't report that the state CPS and child protective services systems are five times more likely to abuse or kill children.
[21:17.000 --> 21:24.000]  So they sweep it under the rug, the rape rooms, the torture camps, how they murder them, how they fly them out of the country,
[21:24.000 --> 21:28.000]  how most major CPS heads at the state level are known, convicted pedophiles.
[21:28.000 --> 21:31.000]  Oh, you don't believe me. Just Google that. You'll have mainstream news when it comes out.
[21:31.000 --> 21:33.000]  It still slips out here and there.
[21:33.000 --> 21:37.000]  Again, that's just one little example of how all of this works.
[21:37.000 --> 21:47.000]  So fake TV news widespread and undisclosed and they pose on the TV news nationally and locally telling you that mercury is good for you.
[21:47.000 --> 21:50.000]  It's a lot of take vaccines. You'll be arrested if you don't.
[21:50.000 --> 21:52.000]  And the public just believes it.
[21:52.000 --> 21:59.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the level of lying is so bad, I can't even, there's so many lies, I can't even cover it all.
[21:59.000 --> 22:04.000]  You have a bankrupt criminal dominant media.
[22:04.000 --> 22:09.000]  They're owned by the very same banks and brokerage firms that staged the economic collapse.
[22:09.000 --> 22:11.000]  We are now witnessing, I'm going to get to that later.
[22:11.000 --> 22:13.000]  Big new developments there.
[22:13.000 --> 22:15.000]  Here's another one on the lying front.
[22:15.000 --> 22:17.000]  This is out of the London Telegraph.
[22:17.000 --> 22:22.000]  Now, I was already aware of this information by interviewing top scientists who've been complaining about it for years,
[22:22.000 --> 22:27.000]  but this is the first time I've seen it in mainstream news, really lay it out.
[22:27.000 --> 22:34.000]  They just falsify the reports of the earth heating up.
[22:34.000 --> 22:44.000]  They just lie and put in fake data the U.S. government does and these other private groups and Al Gore's little buddy who's the main fearmonger.
[22:44.000 --> 22:47.000]  You can go read this story on the Drudge Report.
[22:47.000 --> 22:49.000]  We can link through the telegraph.
[22:49.000 --> 22:52.000]  It's the world has never seen such freezing heat.
[22:52.000 --> 23:00.000]  And I love, there's thousands of comments on the story below and if you read them, it's all scientists saying, look at this.
[23:00.000 --> 23:09.000]  And they'll put a link up to the year's index, say, from a weather station in Antarctica or a weather station in Dallas, Texas,
[23:09.000 --> 23:13.000]  or a weather station in New Mexico.
[23:13.000 --> 23:22.000]  And then they link to what the U.S. government is claiming and what Al Gore is claiming and it will show that in every case it's lies.
[23:22.000 --> 23:24.000]  They just lie.
[23:24.000 --> 23:30.000]  The Antarctic to the north and the Arctic to the south both had record cold so far this year.
[23:30.000 --> 23:42.000]  And they're growing so fast, each ice shelf has grown over 30%, closing sea lanes that haven't been closed in over 100 years.
[23:42.000 --> 23:45.000]  The Arctic ice sheets are growing so fast.
[23:45.000 --> 23:47.000]  By the way, so is Mars.
[23:47.000 --> 23:51.000]  Mars ice caps are just exploding right now.
[23:51.000 --> 23:57.000]  The entire solar system, the planets that had ice caps had been getting smaller for the last 100 years.
[23:57.000 --> 23:59.000]  This was all marked down by universities with telescopes.
[23:59.000 --> 24:06.000]  Now they're exploding in size, not because of your SUV, because the sun just cooled down.
[24:06.000 --> 24:09.000]  The coldest winter on record is really 1930.
[24:09.000 --> 24:14.000]  They've only been keeping records for about 200 years.
[24:14.000 --> 24:21.000]  Things are cooling down and cooling down fast, ladies and gentlemen, plunging.
[24:21.000 --> 24:24.000]  Now, I don't need to see all these documents.
[24:24.000 --> 24:26.000]  I don't need to see that the U.S. government's lying.
[24:26.000 --> 24:28.000]  I don't need to go, I mean, I know that.
[24:28.000 --> 24:31.000]  Now the local weather stations and governments and other ones aren't.
[24:31.000 --> 24:38.000]  In fact, they're all going, wait a minute, all the numbers you use for your model are a lie.
[24:38.000 --> 24:40.000]  And then they get caught.
[24:40.000 --> 24:42.000]  I mean, this is fraud, ladies and gentlemen.
[24:42.000 --> 24:46.000]  This is how they operate.
[24:46.000 --> 24:56.000]  But I saw Robert Kennedy, Jr. on PBS today, and I'm only watching about 20 minutes.
[24:56.000 --> 24:58.000]  Then I flipped over some other channels.
[24:58.000 --> 25:00.000]  But the point that I flipped back, there were more lies.
[25:00.000 --> 25:01.000]  And there were so many lies.
[25:01.000 --> 25:04.000]  I was writing notes.
[25:04.000 --> 25:06.000]  I had to get physically off the treadmill.
[25:06.000 --> 25:09.000]  That's when I watch TV and write notes.
[25:09.000 --> 25:11.000]  And that's why I said, forget it, my workout's more important than this.
[25:11.000 --> 25:13.000]  I can't jog and jump off the right notes.
[25:13.000 --> 25:15.000]  I'm just going to flip to something else.
[25:15.000 --> 25:19.000]  But in one minute, I heard him tell three lies.
[25:19.000 --> 25:20.000]  One minute.
[25:20.000 --> 25:24.000]  Now, all these are easily verified lies in seconds.
[25:24.000 --> 25:31.000]  The guy that I'm not being the environmental chief who's going to basically like the mafia squeeze money out of everybody, all human activity.
[25:31.000 --> 25:35.000]  He said, we're going to have a carbon-free economy.
[25:35.000 --> 25:37.000]  Carbon will be outlawed.
[25:37.000 --> 25:39.000]  Now, that right there, ladies and gentlemen.
[25:39.000 --> 25:42.000]  I mean, carbon is in everything, everything you do.
[25:42.000 --> 25:44.000]  All industries connected to carbon.
[25:44.000 --> 25:45.000]  Carbon is not bad.
[25:45.000 --> 25:46.000]  It's part of life.
[25:46.000 --> 25:47.000]  We're a carbon-based life form.
[25:47.000 --> 25:48.000]  So this is such a joke.
[25:48.000 --> 25:51.000]  Plants breathe carbon dioxide.
[25:51.000 --> 25:58.000]  He went on to say the United States only has 1% of the world's oil and natural gas.
[25:58.000 --> 26:06.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, what the federal government admits in Alaska is as much oil as is in Saudi Arabia.
[26:06.000 --> 26:09.000]  They just won't let us have it.
[26:09.000 --> 26:14.000]  There is a 600 square mile area starting about 70 miles up the coast of Louisiana.
[26:14.000 --> 26:15.000]  And I've linked to this.
[26:15.000 --> 26:17.000]  It's official government announcements.
[26:17.000 --> 26:18.000]  They found it in the 70s.
[26:18.000 --> 26:24.000]  They laid it off use more oil than Saudi Arabia.
[26:24.000 --> 26:29.000]  1,600 square mile area in our water.
[26:29.000 --> 26:31.000]  Okay, Jack.
[26:31.000 --> 26:36.000]  Anywhere you drill in Texas, deep enough.
[26:36.000 --> 26:38.000]  I mean, they're drilling.
[26:38.000 --> 26:41.000]  Fort Worth looks like an oil field now.
[26:41.000 --> 26:42.000]  They got oil rigs.
[26:42.000 --> 26:44.000]  They're in people's yards.
[26:44.000 --> 26:46.000]  The gas fields, it's just everywhere.
[26:46.000 --> 26:50.000]  From Fort Worth to Houston now, they have discovered a field.
[26:50.000 --> 26:57.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, gas wise that puts Venezuela to shame.
[26:57.000 --> 27:07.000]  You go down to 15,000 feet basically anywhere and so much gas comes out of the ground that the rigs, after they drill them,
[27:07.000 --> 27:11.000]  I mean, they leave these five story nozzles on them.
[27:11.000 --> 27:13.000]  They're so huge.
[27:13.000 --> 27:16.000]  Drive out to East Texas anywhere, everywhere you drive.
[27:16.000 --> 27:26.000]  There's nothing but giant Derrick's drilling or giant nozzles where the rig has come in.
[27:26.000 --> 27:28.000]  That's what else is coming out of these.
[27:28.000 --> 27:30.000]  Helium.
[27:30.000 --> 27:32.000]  All sorts of other great gases.
[27:32.000 --> 27:34.000]  All sorts of other exotic oils.
[27:34.000 --> 27:36.000]  Folks, there's so much oil.
[27:36.000 --> 27:37.000]  The Russians have found so much oil.
[27:37.000 --> 27:39.000]  There's oil everywhere.
[27:39.000 --> 27:40.000]  There's gas everywhere.
[27:40.000 --> 27:44.000]  When they drill these wells in East Texas from Fort Worth all the way to Houston,
[27:44.000 --> 27:49.000]  just one giant gas field, they hit oil four or five times on the way down
[27:49.000 --> 27:52.000]  and there's so much gas they don't even want the oil.
[27:52.000 --> 27:57.000]  They just cap it off.
[27:57.000 --> 28:00.000]  They start drilling on average a 15,000 foot well
[28:00.000 --> 28:05.000]  and they hit oil at 1,000 feet, 5,000 feet, 10,000 feet,
[28:05.000 --> 28:07.000]  16,000 feet above just oil, oil, oil.
[28:07.000 --> 28:09.000]  They'll hit gas over and over again
[28:09.000 --> 28:15.000]  and they just greedily keep digging down to that super mother load, ladies and gentlemen.
[28:15.000 --> 28:18.000]  This little bastard, this little liar, he knows.
[28:18.000 --> 28:22.000]  He comes on and tells you there's artificial scarcity just like the De Beers
[28:22.000 --> 28:25.000]  and the Oppenheimers with the diamonds claiming diamonds are scarce
[28:25.000 --> 28:28.000]  when they're not even hardly semi-precious.
[28:28.000 --> 28:31.000]  In Africa, they just lay around on the ground everywhere
[28:31.000 --> 28:33.000]  but they have a monopoly over it.
[28:33.000 --> 28:35.000]  They have giant warehouses all over Europe.
[28:35.000 --> 28:36.000]  This is admitted.
[28:36.000 --> 28:37.000]  See, it's the same thing.
[28:37.000 --> 28:39.000]  Oil, they're telling you there's no oil
[28:39.000 --> 28:43.000]  and they're claiming the economic crisis is because we're in an oil economy.
[28:43.000 --> 28:44.000]  They want feudalism.
[28:44.000 --> 28:46.000]  They don't want a free market.
[28:46.000 --> 28:48.000]  He told a bunch of other lies.
[28:48.000 --> 28:49.000]  It was just disgusting.
[28:49.000 --> 29:18.000]  That rat bastard.
[29:19.000 --> 29:45.000]  That rat.
[29:45.000 --> 29:52.000]  Call 888-213-4338 and help us win this battle.
[30:15.000 --> 30:22.000]  Call 888-213-4338 and help us win this battle.
[30:45.000 --> 30:52.000]  That's 877-394-6657 or go to getseeds.net.

[32:21.000 --> 32:31.000]  I hope Mr. Bush will hear this song for the heart of America wants this one.

[32:57.000 --> 33:06.000]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[33:06.000 --> 33:07.000]  Yeah, just finishing up.
[33:07.000 --> 33:11.000]  I'm watching PBS and they've got this round table of people.
[33:11.000 --> 33:14.000]  Republicans, Democrats, former head of the CIA,
[33:14.000 --> 33:18.000]  Walsy, Robert Kennedy Jr., all of them.
[33:18.000 --> 33:19.000]  And they're all saying the same thing.
[33:19.000 --> 33:24.000]  Take over the economy, ban carbon, tax, regulate everybody.
[33:24.000 --> 33:27.000]  And then they'd say, yeah, let's put transponders in all the cars
[33:27.000 --> 33:29.000]  and tax you as you drive down the road,
[33:29.000 --> 33:31.000]  which they're already testing all over the nation.
[33:31.000 --> 33:34.000]  And then they would all say, but it's not a tax.
[33:34.000 --> 33:36.000]  They talk to us like we're idiots.
[33:36.000 --> 33:39.000]  Here's this PR pitch on PBS.
[33:39.000 --> 33:41.000]  Then I flip over to the local news channel
[33:41.000 --> 33:45.000]  and there's things about other brainwashing the brownies
[33:45.000 --> 33:47.000]  and Girl Scouts about global warming.
[33:47.000 --> 33:50.000]  And then I flip back over to another local news channel
[33:50.000 --> 33:52.000]  and there's another thing about global warming.
[33:52.000 --> 33:53.000]  Then I flip over to CNN.
[33:53.000 --> 33:54.000]  This is today.
[33:54.000 --> 33:57.000]  There's another thing about global warming.
[33:57.000 --> 34:01.000]  Meanwhile, they are lying with the temperatures.
[34:01.000 --> 34:03.000]  You can go check the U.S. government,
[34:03.000 --> 34:04.000]  what NASA's putting out.
[34:04.000 --> 34:07.000]  You can go check what Al Gore's people are putting out,
[34:07.000 --> 34:10.000]  what the environmental, and they just lie.
[34:10.000 --> 34:13.000]  They're still saying this is the coldest winter on record.
[34:13.000 --> 34:15.000]  They're still saying polar bears can't swim
[34:15.000 --> 34:17.000]  and are drowning because the ice caps are melting.
[34:17.000 --> 34:19.000]  Of course, they don't live in the north.
[34:19.000 --> 34:25.000]  All lies, record numbers, and they're going to list carbon dioxide
[34:25.000 --> 34:27.000]  as toxic waste, ladies and gentlemen,
[34:27.000 --> 34:29.000]  and regulate and come after everybody.
[34:29.000 --> 34:31.000]  And then I saw Robert Kennedy Jr. and everybody nod their heads
[34:31.000 --> 34:33.000]  and they had other guests on there saying, yeah,
[34:33.000 --> 34:34.000]  and everybody out of work,
[34:34.000 --> 34:37.000]  we're going to give them a federal government job fighting
[34:37.000 --> 34:41.000]  for the environment and enforcing the new green economy.
[34:41.000 --> 34:45.000]  And on his website, now understand, this is nonpartisan.
[34:45.000 --> 34:48.000]  They've got the Republican preachers, the Democrat preachers,
[34:48.000 --> 34:54.000]  you know, the Al Sharptons and the head of the 700 clubs
[34:54.000 --> 34:58.000]  up there together on TV shows saying global warming's real.
[34:58.000 --> 34:59.000]  We need a global tax.
[34:59.000 --> 35:01.000]  It will save you.
[35:01.000 --> 35:03.000]  The NFL saying it's real.
[35:03.000 --> 35:05.000]  We've got, I mean, this is the big government move
[35:05.000 --> 35:08.000]  to tax and regulate every facet of your life.
[35:08.000 --> 35:10.000]  And that's what the G20 just met about,
[35:10.000 --> 35:13.000]  is a new global tax paid directly to the private banks,
[35:13.000 --> 35:19.000]  making a select inner group of banks the heads of world government.
[35:19.000 --> 35:22.000]  And then, again, they kept repeating,
[35:22.000 --> 35:25.000]  we only have 1% of the oil and gas total lie.
[35:25.000 --> 35:27.000]  They said this is not a tax.
[35:27.000 --> 35:31.000]  They would describe taxing you, but then say this is not a tax.
[35:31.000 --> 35:35.000]  They were saying it's the hottest year on record
[35:35.000 --> 35:37.000]  when it's really one of the coldest.
[35:37.000 --> 35:43.000]  I mean, just lying, lying, lying, lying, lying, lying, lying, lying, lying.
[35:43.000 --> 35:44.000]  People say, well, that's just your opinion.
[35:44.000 --> 35:46.000]  No, it's not my opinion.
[35:46.000 --> 35:49.000]  They admit, listen to this, the world has never been,
[35:49.000 --> 35:51.000]  has never seen such freezing heat,
[35:51.000 --> 35:52.000]  London Telegraph today.
[35:52.000 --> 35:54.000]  The surreal scientific blunder,
[35:54.000 --> 35:56.000]  they call it a blunder, it's not a blunder.
[35:56.000 --> 36:00.000]  Last week raised a huge question mark about the temperature records
[36:00.000 --> 36:02.000]  that underpinned the worldwide alarm of the global warming.
[36:02.000 --> 36:06.000]  On Mondays, NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies,
[36:06.000 --> 36:08.000]  which is named after a Nazi, I would add,
[36:08.000 --> 36:12.000]  which is run by Al Gore's chief scientific ally, Dr. James Hansen,
[36:12.000 --> 36:16.000]  and is one of the four bodies responsible for monitoring global temperatures,
[36:16.000 --> 36:21.000]  announced that last month was the hottest October on record.
[36:21.000 --> 36:24.000]  This was startling across the world.
[36:24.000 --> 36:27.000]  There were reports of unseasonal snow and plummeting temperatures
[36:27.000 --> 36:30.000]  last month from the American Great Plains to China,
[36:30.000 --> 36:32.000]  and from the Alps to New Zealand.
[36:32.000 --> 36:36.000]  China's official news agency reported that Tibet had suffered its worst snowstorm ever.
[36:36.000 --> 36:40.000]  In the U.S., the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
[36:40.000 --> 36:45.000]  registered 63 local snowstorm records and 115 lowest ever temperatures
[36:45.000 --> 36:54.000]  for the month and ranked it as one of the 70 warmest in October in 114 years
[36:54.000 --> 36:59.000]  and ranked it as only the 70th warmest October in 114 years.
[36:59.000 --> 37:01.000]  So it's about average.
[37:01.000 --> 37:03.000]  So what explained the anomaly?
[37:03.000 --> 37:07.000]  The GISS computerized temperature map seemed to show readings
[37:07.000 --> 37:12.000]  across a large part of Russia have been up to 10 degrees higher than normal.
[37:12.000 --> 37:16.000]  But when expert readers of the two leading warming skeptic blogs,
[37:16.000 --> 37:21.000]  what's up with that, and climate audit began detailing analysis of the GIS data,
[37:21.000 --> 37:25.000]  an astounding discovery. The reason for the freak figures was
[37:25.000 --> 37:28.000]  that scores of temperature records from Russia and elsewhere
[37:28.000 --> 37:31.000]  were not based on October readings at all.
[37:31.000 --> 37:34.000]  Figures from the previous month had simply been carried over
[37:34.000 --> 37:36.000]  and repeated two months running.
[37:36.000 --> 37:39.000]  And then they, it's a long article, then they catch them
[37:39.000 --> 37:42.000]  and then they would just cheat and move other numbers in and they're so lazy,
[37:42.000 --> 37:45.000]  they'll just take, you know, a half of a country
[37:45.000 --> 37:49.000]  and just set the same fake temperature for all of it.
[37:49.000 --> 37:52.000]  They don't even try to cheat where you don't notice it.
[37:52.000 --> 37:57.000]  They just, they just fake all the numbers, use the same number across the country,
[37:57.000 --> 38:01.000]  put out a fake number from the summer for October.
[38:01.000 --> 38:03.000]  And then when they got caught, then they went,
[38:03.000 --> 38:06.000]  because they didn't want to be proven wrong, overall the earth had actually cooled down,
[38:06.000 --> 38:10.000]  which it did, then they went and snuck and raised the temperature
[38:10.000 --> 38:14.000]  on the map in other areas. They are liars.
[38:14.000 --> 38:17.000]  The Club of Rome, the Council on Foreign Relations and other groups,
[38:17.000 --> 38:20.000]  we've written articles at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com
[38:20.000 --> 38:25.000]  with direct links to the United Nations and others
[38:25.000 --> 38:29.000]  admitting it's all fake and that it is a scheme
[38:29.000 --> 38:31.000]  to bring in world government and world taxation
[38:31.000 --> 38:36.000]  in a way to regulate all human activity to control you.
[38:36.000 --> 38:39.000]  Now, they admit it's about taxing.
[38:39.000 --> 38:42.000]  It has nothing to do with the environment.
[38:42.000 --> 38:46.000]  In fact, what it does is it gets heat off real environmental offenders
[38:46.000 --> 38:50.000]  with toxic waste, open air genetic engineering, cross species engineering,
[38:50.000 --> 38:53.000]  a lot of other serious things that are happening,
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.000]  things that are really already causing problems.
[38:55.000 --> 39:00.000]  These GMO crops killing the honeybees, major studies on that,
[39:00.000 --> 39:04.000]  because they have this particular corn variety put out by Monsanto,
[39:04.000 --> 39:07.000]  just in one German study.
[39:07.000 --> 39:10.000]  It grows its own pesticide, so bugs won't eat it,
[39:10.000 --> 39:15.000]  but honeybees still go and pick up the pollen, so they go back and die.
[39:15.000 --> 39:19.000]  See, and they're feeding us the pesticide, too.
[39:19.000 --> 39:22.000]  And they argue, well, this is a naturally occurring fungal pesticide
[39:22.000 --> 39:25.000]  that it produces, yeah, but it's like a thousand times higher
[39:25.000 --> 39:29.000]  than what would naturally occur in corn.
[39:29.000 --> 39:32.000]  Just so happens that most of the rats and guinea pigs
[39:32.000 --> 39:34.000]  that are fed these GMO foods die.
[39:34.000 --> 39:36.000]  Well, it's hurting us, too, folks.
[39:36.000 --> 39:40.000]  We're mammals. We're in the same family.
[39:40.000 --> 39:48.000]  That's why all these intestinal diseases, diseases of the gut are way up.
[39:48.000 --> 39:50.000]  So that's why I'm so upset, ladies and gentlemen,
[39:50.000 --> 39:54.000]  because the article just goes on and on where they got caught lying
[39:54.000 --> 39:57.000]  and then cheated again and again and again,
[39:57.000 --> 39:59.000]  and then you never see this in the mainstream news.
[39:59.000 --> 40:01.000]  It finally met in the telegraph.
[40:01.000 --> 40:04.000]  And then every time I criticize this, I get letters saying,
[40:04.000 --> 40:06.000]  oh, you work for the oil companies, or you're lying.
[40:06.000 --> 40:09.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the oil companies are owned by the big private banks
[40:09.000 --> 40:11.000]  that issue the currency and the liquidity.
[40:11.000 --> 40:13.000]  They control the issuance of money.
[40:13.000 --> 40:15.000]  They don't care about, quote, making money.
[40:15.000 --> 40:18.000]  They care about consolidating markets.
[40:18.000 --> 40:21.000]  They care about monopolies and control.
[40:21.000 --> 40:22.000]  Yeah, they make money.
[40:22.000 --> 40:25.000]  They literally order the issuance and the printing of it.
[40:25.000 --> 40:28.000]  They make money the old-fashioned way they print it.
[40:28.000 --> 40:30.000]  Now, that said, I've got a lot of other news here.
[40:30.000 --> 40:32.000]  This is associated press.
[40:32.000 --> 40:36.000]  Security focuses on protesters more than terrorists.
[40:36.000 --> 40:39.000]  And it goes on to say the U.S. government admits that actually
[40:39.000 --> 40:43.000]  the entire anti-terror apparatus is focused on protesters and jobless,
[40:43.000 --> 40:46.000]  and that they believe the American people are basically terrorists.
[40:46.000 --> 40:48.000]  See, I told you, the whole thing is for us,
[40:48.000 --> 40:50.000]  when they take our pension funds and everything else,
[40:50.000 --> 40:52.000]  which, by the way, they're announcing they're going to do,
[40:52.000 --> 40:54.000]  they're going to take large portions of your private pension funds,
[40:54.000 --> 40:57.000]  your 401Ks, Congress is openly having hearings.
[40:57.000 --> 41:00.000]  They're going to steal it in the name of protecting it,
[41:00.000 --> 41:02.000]  just like Argentina just did.
[41:02.000 --> 41:04.000]  And if you go out and protest it,
[41:04.000 --> 41:07.000]  they'll just have cops go out and stage provocateur actions,
[41:07.000 --> 41:10.000]  and they'll have cops dressed up like protesters attack other cops,
[41:10.000 --> 41:12.000]  and then they'll just fire rubber bullets on the peaceful crowd.
[41:12.000 --> 41:15.000]  Denver Post, again, just admitted in Denver,
[41:15.000 --> 41:17.000]  we caught them in Minneapolis.
[41:17.000 --> 41:20.000]  We weren't sure about Denver.
[41:20.000 --> 41:22.000]  Well, now the police admit they...
[41:22.000 --> 41:24.000]  See, it's like above board now.
[41:24.000 --> 41:29.000]  Yeah, we attack our own officers so we can attack crowds of people with billy clubs,
[41:29.000 --> 41:30.000]  but that's good.
[41:30.000 --> 41:32.000]  Aren't you from police officers?
[41:32.000 --> 41:34.000]  Yeah, we go out and provocateur.
[41:34.000 --> 41:36.000]  Shut up or you don't like cops.
[41:36.000 --> 41:39.000]  Well, okay, I'm sorry, you know.
[41:39.000 --> 41:42.000]  But see, we have a corrupt bankrupt system.
[41:42.000 --> 41:45.000]  And so police, you think you can go commit those crimes
[41:45.000 --> 41:47.000]  because the higher-ups tell you it's okay?
[41:47.000 --> 41:49.000]  Well, just remember, just remember,
[41:49.000 --> 41:51.000]  you work for a criminal elite,
[41:51.000 --> 41:53.000]  doesn't care about you either.
[41:53.000 --> 41:55.000]  You know, American people see women who's a dead Iraqi children
[41:55.000 --> 41:58.000]  and say, ah, good, they're sub-human, kill them.
[41:58.000 --> 42:01.000]  Don't you understand the elite thinks of you the same way?
[42:01.000 --> 42:04.000]  And see, now they're taking your pension funds.
[42:04.000 --> 42:08.000]  Now, they've already sucked $5 trillion, as we told you they would.
[42:08.000 --> 42:10.000]  It was in the bill.
[42:10.000 --> 42:13.000]  The bailout was not a bailout.
[42:13.000 --> 42:14.000]  It was a banker takeover.
[42:14.000 --> 42:17.000]  And of course it wasn't to pay off subprime mortgages.
[42:17.000 --> 42:18.000]  That was never the problem.
[42:18.000 --> 42:21.000]  And now exactly what I told you has happened.
[42:21.000 --> 42:24.000]  They kept it all and none of it's going for mortgages.
[42:24.000 --> 42:26.000]  And it's unlimited.
[42:26.000 --> 42:28.000]  And I watched Friday's hearings, by the way,
[42:28.000 --> 42:30.000]  our own C-span right now re-airing,
[42:30.000 --> 42:34.000]  and Qashqari said, you gave us omnipotent power.
[42:34.000 --> 42:36.000]  Basically, just sit down and shut up.
[42:36.000 --> 42:38.000]  We'll take whatever we want.
[42:38.000 --> 42:40.000]  They'll just put some more fake newscast on,
[42:40.000 --> 42:42.000]  put some more ball games on,
[42:42.000 --> 42:45.000]  and they'll all be third world slaves.
[42:45.000 --> 42:48.000]  They'll just fool a bunch of liberals with Barack Obama.
[42:48.000 --> 42:50.000]  Okay, we're going to come back, go to your phone calls,
[42:50.000 --> 42:51.000]  and a lot of other news.
[42:51.000 --> 42:53.000]  Stay with me. We'll get into the...
[42:53.000 --> 42:55.000]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[42:55.000 --> 42:56.000]  What does humidity mean to you?

[42:59.000 --> 43:01.000]  And many people are beginning to realize
[43:01.000 --> 43:04.000]  that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.

[45:08.000 --> 45:10.000]  as being related to this heavy metal exposure,
[45:10.000 --> 45:13.000]  including memory loss, high blood pressure, depression,
[45:13.000 --> 45:15.000]  mood swings, speech disorders, neuropathy,
[45:15.000 --> 45:18.000]  autoimmune diseases, chronic fatigue, and more.
[45:18.000 --> 45:20.000]  Unfortunately, traditional detoxifying
[45:20.000 --> 45:22.000]  isn't able to clear the body of these harmful
[45:22.000 --> 45:24.000]  and potentially deadly toxins.
[45:24.000 --> 45:26.000]  That's why there's Puricleer from Ripple Creek.
[45:26.000 --> 45:29.000]  Puricleer contains a proprietary blend of ingredients,
[45:29.000 --> 45:32.000]  including a cilantro extract and alphalipoic acid,
[45:32.000 --> 45:34.000]  among other ingredients formulated specifically
[45:34.000 --> 45:36.000]  to promote body cleansing.
[45:36.000 --> 45:38.000]  Puricleer also has ingredients selected
[45:38.000 --> 45:41.000]  to promote improved circulation to enhance activity
[45:41.000 --> 45:43.000]  so that heavy metals may be more effectively captured
[45:43.000 --> 45:45.000]  and removed from the body.
[45:45.000 --> 45:47.000]  Order Puricleer now by calling Ripple Creek
[45:47.000 --> 45:50.000]  at 203-331-0363
[45:50.000 --> 46:19.000]  or go to RippleCreek.com.
[46:20.000 --> 46:22.000]  RippleCreek.com also said,
[46:22.000 --> 46:24.000]  why retreat?
[46:24.000 --> 46:26.000]  This is a question that 90% of our population
[46:26.000 --> 46:28.000]  cannot and will not answer.
[46:28.000 --> 46:31.000]  If they could, that same 90% would have to admit
[46:31.000 --> 46:34.000]  that things may not continue on as they are now.
[46:34.000 --> 46:37.000]  They would also have to admit that they will need a retreat,
[46:37.000 --> 46:40.000]  something completely impossible for the average American to do.
[46:40.000 --> 46:42.000]  Act now before it's too late.
[46:42.000 --> 46:44.000]  In order to find your new,

[46:57.000 --> 47:05.000]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[47:05.000 --> 47:07.000]  Coming up next hour,
[47:07.000 --> 47:10.000]  I'm going to break down exactly what
[47:10.000 --> 47:12.000]  less than 10 global banks are doing,
[47:12.000 --> 47:14.000]  what the G20 meant for.
[47:14.000 --> 47:16.000]  Remember, I told you five weeks ago
[47:16.000 --> 47:19.000]  that it was going to be $5 trillion to begin with.
[47:19.000 --> 47:22.000]  This week it was in hundreds of mainstream news articles
[47:22.000 --> 47:24.000]  that the bailout is now $5 trillion.
[47:24.000 --> 47:27.000]  See, I actually did something that is considered bizarre.
[47:27.000 --> 47:29.000]  I actually read the bill,
[47:29.000 --> 47:31.000]  and it said, the Treasury is above the law,
[47:31.000 --> 47:33.000]  the Federal Reserve can take over America.
[47:33.000 --> 47:35.000]  No one can review this.
[47:35.000 --> 47:37.000]  And so now they're saying, we won't tell you where the trillions went.
[47:37.000 --> 47:39.000]  And no, it didn't go for mortgages.
[47:39.000 --> 47:42.000]  And here's the scary news.
[47:42.000 --> 47:45.000]  $5 trillion conservatively was in the bill.
[47:45.000 --> 47:47.000]  It could be as much as $10 trillion.
[47:47.000 --> 47:49.000]  And it looks like if in five weeks
[47:49.000 --> 47:51.000]  they've already blown $5 trillion.
[47:51.000 --> 47:53.000]  And by the way, the private banks are giving the money,
[47:53.000 --> 47:57.000]  the $5 trillion, and they go out and buy stock for themselves.
[47:57.000 --> 48:01.000]  And then you're going to have to pay it back in taxes
[48:01.000 --> 48:03.000]  and in dollar devaluation.
[48:03.000 --> 48:05.000]  But see, that's okay for them
[48:05.000 --> 48:07.000]  because they've already got a real asset.
[48:07.000 --> 48:10.000]  And then I read about how they're suddenly auditing everybody
[48:10.000 --> 48:12.000]  and squeezing everyone at the IRS.
[48:12.000 --> 48:15.000]  For the few middle class people, the rich will be left alone.
[48:15.000 --> 48:18.000]  But the poor folks think somebody making 100 grand a year is rich.
[48:18.000 --> 48:20.000]  The billionaires will be left alone.
[48:20.000 --> 48:23.000]  People making a million over a decade, they'll be attacked.
[48:23.000 --> 48:26.000]  But they're just going to turn the taxors.
[48:26.000 --> 48:27.000]  I mean, if you've seen the cops,
[48:27.000 --> 48:30.000]  you'll see 50 of them on the road now writing tickets.
[48:30.000 --> 48:33.000]  And property tax, everything, they're going to squeeze you.
[48:33.000 --> 48:35.000]  They're going to take your houses.
[48:35.000 --> 48:38.000]  They are, because that's all got to go to those offshore banks.
[48:38.000 --> 48:43.000]  And I heard all these fake neocons on the radio saying,
[48:43.000 --> 48:45.000]  well, I don't like being a socialism,
[48:45.000 --> 48:48.000]  but we better fund this bailout or the economy will collapse.
[48:48.000 --> 48:49.000]  You suckers.
[48:49.000 --> 48:51.000]  Number one, it's not socialism.
[48:51.000 --> 48:54.000]  If I go rob a bank, it's not socialism.
[48:54.000 --> 48:56.000]  It's called a heist.
[48:56.000 --> 48:58.000]  But they got up there and told the suckers,
[48:58.000 --> 49:00.000]  all right, I said I'd go to the calls.
[49:00.000 --> 49:06.000]  I mean, they're giving CEOs $300, $400, $500 million bonuses,
[49:06.000 --> 49:09.000]  and they're admitting they had a Goldman Sachs brag the New York town.
[49:09.000 --> 49:12.000]  He said, we're just buying other banks up, healthy ones.
[49:12.000 --> 49:14.000]  And I'm giving myself a bonus.
[49:14.000 --> 49:15.000]  It's funny.
[49:15.000 --> 49:19.000]  See, we're here to be laughed at because we're the sports fans.
[49:19.000 --> 49:21.000]  We're the idiots of earth.
[49:21.000 --> 49:24.000]  We're an evil country that will go attack brown people
[49:24.000 --> 49:27.000]  and kill a couple million of them for no reason in Iraq
[49:27.000 --> 49:28.000]  and make jokes about it.
[49:28.000 --> 49:31.000]  And the elites say, look at these suckers that we enslave.
[49:31.000 --> 49:34.000]  Let's just steal everything they've got.
[49:34.000 --> 49:37.000]  And the suckers say, yeah, yeah, I like it.
[49:37.000 --> 49:38.000]  Hurt me.
[49:38.000 --> 49:40.000]  Take everything I got.
[49:40.000 --> 49:42.000]  They control the left.
[49:42.000 --> 49:43.000]  They control the right.
[49:43.000 --> 49:48.000]  And again, Barack Obama spying, secret arrest, big government, all of it.
[49:48.000 --> 49:51.000]  It's going to be Bush on steroids, but the left is just all,
[49:51.000 --> 49:56.000]  suddenly there's all these pro war groups, all these leftist groups.
[49:56.000 --> 49:57.000]  Oh, we love war.
[49:57.000 --> 49:58.000]  Oh, it's so good.
[49:58.000 --> 49:59.000]  We love torture.
[49:59.000 --> 50:00.000]  We love secret arrest.
[50:00.000 --> 50:02.000]  I've got stacks of articles.
[50:02.000 --> 50:05.000]  They're up on prisonblinded.com today.
[50:05.000 --> 50:06.000]  All right.
[50:06.000 --> 50:07.000]  I said, I go to your calls.
[50:07.000 --> 50:08.000]  A lot of calls next hour too.
[50:08.000 --> 50:10.000]  I've been on kind of a rant today.
[50:10.000 --> 50:14.000]  Let's, well, Zip lock is first and then much for the college,
[50:14.000 --> 50:16.000]  but Mike and Kam does as he disagrees.
[50:16.000 --> 50:18.000]  So he goes to the head of the line.
[50:18.000 --> 50:20.000]  Go ahead, Mike, you're on the year.
[50:20.000 --> 50:23.000]  I got two main points.
[50:23.000 --> 50:29.000]  First point is that when you talk about the founding fathers of America
[50:29.000 --> 50:35.000]  and the republic and my point is that if they have got good quotes
[50:35.000 --> 50:38.000]  and they're trying to make it seem like they're against them,
[50:38.000 --> 50:40.000]  I mean, yeah, they're going to have good quotes.
[50:40.000 --> 50:41.000]  All right.
[50:41.000 --> 50:42.000]  That's not really much proof beyond that.
[50:42.000 --> 50:45.000]  I understand it's fashionable to bash the founding fathers,
[50:45.000 --> 50:48.000]  but if you've really studied history, they were amazing people.
[50:48.000 --> 50:50.000]  And it really was the second Renaissance.
[50:50.000 --> 50:53.000]  So you can judge people by the day they were in by today's standards
[50:53.000 --> 50:55.000]  and then say, oh, look how bad they were.
[50:55.000 --> 50:58.000]  But we just have other forms of slavery today.
[50:58.000 --> 51:02.000]  The government puts the drugs out like a deer hunter puts a deer feeder out.
[51:02.000 --> 51:04.000]  And then when the idiots come up and use it,
[51:04.000 --> 51:06.000]  they throw you in their private prisons.
[51:06.000 --> 51:09.000]  How much pot are you smoking right now?
[51:09.000 --> 51:10.000]  Not much.
[51:10.000 --> 51:11.000]  Admit your stoned.
[51:11.000 --> 51:12.000]  I am.
[51:12.000 --> 51:13.000]  Yeah, I can just hear it.
[51:13.000 --> 51:14.000]  Okay.
[51:14.000 --> 51:16.000]  My mind burns with energy.
[51:16.000 --> 51:18.000]  It burns with understanding.
[51:18.000 --> 51:19.000]  Okay.
[51:19.000 --> 51:20.000]  Continually expanding.
[51:20.000 --> 51:22.000]  I can't even articulate to you what I know, sir.
[51:22.000 --> 51:26.000]  I can see you there sitting there smoking the pot in your apartment,
[51:26.000 --> 51:29.000]  calling in, trying to tell me I'm stupid and I'm wrong.
[51:29.000 --> 51:31.000]  Now, what am I wrong about?
[51:31.000 --> 51:34.000]  No, you're right about a lot of stuff.
[51:34.000 --> 51:38.000]  But my second point is that when you say that we've got to put these people
[51:38.000 --> 51:40.000]  up against the court system,
[51:40.000 --> 51:44.000]  I don't think that we should have any courts or republics or anything
[51:44.000 --> 51:46.000]  because that's just like enough.
[51:46.000 --> 51:51.000]  You know, I've talked to a million potheds who read some libertarian
[51:51.000 --> 51:55.000]  screed and then think no government, no organization, no nothing.
[51:55.000 --> 51:58.000]  That isn't how the world works, pal.
[51:58.000 --> 52:02.000]  You have to have a small government to protect you from other governments
[52:02.000 --> 52:03.000]  and other criminal groups.
[52:03.000 --> 52:05.000]  That's what the government's for.
[52:05.000 --> 52:09.000]  And it's dangerous, but it's a necessary, very small evil.
[52:09.000 --> 52:11.000]  But libertarians always just say,
[52:11.000 --> 52:16.000]  get rid of all government now instead of being sensible and saying incremental.
[52:16.000 --> 52:18.000]  I'm not trying to be mean to you, sir.
[52:18.000 --> 52:20.000]  If you call in here to disagree,
[52:20.000 --> 52:25.000]  please have something to disagree with me about.
[52:25.000 --> 52:28.000]  Oh, God, I just can't handle it anymore.
[52:28.000 --> 52:31.000]  I mean, I just, I just, I'm not even bashing potheds, folks.
[52:31.000 --> 52:33.000]  I'm for decriminalization.
[52:33.000 --> 52:36.000]  I don't think you should be put in prison for it.
[52:36.000 --> 52:40.000]  My whole point is I'm just tired of people calling in so stoned,
[52:40.000 --> 52:42.000]  they can hardly talk.
[52:42.000 --> 52:46.000]  You know, hey, man, I don't think we need nothing.
[52:46.000 --> 52:50.000]  Okay, whatever, I'm just here giving you the information.
[52:50.000 --> 52:52.000]  You do with it what you want.
[52:52.000 --> 52:55.000]  They're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines and shooting you up.
[52:55.000 --> 52:56.000]  You got that?
[52:56.000 --> 52:57.000]  You got that?
[52:57.000 --> 52:59.000]  Everybody out there has that little kid die of cancer.
[52:59.000 --> 53:00.000]  They murdered your child.
[53:00.000 --> 53:01.000]  You got it?
[53:01.000 --> 53:02.000]  You got it?
[53:02.000 --> 53:03.000]  That's who runs things.
[53:03.000 --> 53:04.000]  They're not playing games with you.
[53:04.000 --> 53:05.000]  You got it?
[53:05.000 --> 53:06.000]  Grow up, people.
[53:06.000 --> 53:07.000]  Stop watching the Green Bay Packers.
[53:07.000 --> 53:10.000]  Play the Colts or whoever they were playing today.
[53:10.000 --> 53:13.000]  Tennessee Titans in the Colts or the Texans in the Colts.
[53:13.000 --> 53:15.000]  All this bull.
[53:15.000 --> 53:17.000]  I don't have time for it anymore.
[53:17.000 --> 53:18.000]  I'm right.
[53:18.000 --> 53:19.000]  You're wrong.
[53:19.000 --> 53:20.000]  Period.
[53:20.000 --> 53:21.000]  I do homework.
[53:21.000 --> 53:22.000]  I research.
[53:22.000 --> 53:26.000]  I know what's going on and you people don't and you better get up off your butts
[53:26.000 --> 53:31.000]  because this is life and death.
[53:31.000 --> 53:32.000]  Zip lock in New Hampshire.
[53:32.000 --> 53:33.000]  You're on the air.
[53:33.000 --> 53:34.000]  Thanks, Alex.
[53:34.000 --> 53:36.000]  Thanks for handling that last call of the way you did
[53:36.000 --> 53:39.000]  because I'm glad you didn't sit tight on that one.
[53:39.000 --> 53:41.000]  That was serious business right there, right?
[53:41.000 --> 53:42.000]  Yeah.
[53:42.000 --> 53:43.000]  Goodness.
[53:43.000 --> 53:45.000]  I had a question for you.
[53:45.000 --> 53:47.000]  In 2009, I'm a voter now.
[53:47.000 --> 53:49.000]  I just entered as a voter.
[53:49.000 --> 53:51.000]  I decided this year to block Barack.
[53:51.000 --> 53:53.000]  I went to the town hall in New Hampshire.
[53:53.000 --> 53:57.000]  I wanted to see what the heck was going on and everybody's all about Barack down there,
[53:57.000 --> 53:59.000]  except the pollsters.
[53:59.000 --> 54:05.000]  The people at the place were actually a little older and they were actually a little wiser.
[54:05.000 --> 54:08.000]  And I'm going in there like, I have my birth certificate with me.
[54:08.000 --> 54:09.000]  Where do I sign up?
[54:09.000 --> 54:10.000]  They say you don't need it.
[54:10.000 --> 54:12.000]  I said I have a birth certificate.
[54:12.000 --> 54:14.000]  I was born right in this town.
[54:14.000 --> 54:16.000]  I want to vote for somebody born in this country.
[54:16.000 --> 54:20.000]  A whole lot of people looked at me like I was crazy, but it's dead serious.
[54:20.000 --> 54:23.000]  This guy, if he wasn't born in this country, how are we voting him in?
[54:23.000 --> 54:29.000]  And how did the info slip from everybody for nobody to even ask who is this guy?
[54:29.000 --> 54:30.000]  That's what I'm wondering.
[54:30.000 --> 54:33.000]  Well, you see, there's wheels within wheels within wheels.
[54:33.000 --> 54:37.000]  I mean, it's great to criticize Barack Obama, but John McCain was bad as well.
[54:37.000 --> 54:45.000]  The way their paradigm works, if we only attack George Bush, then that empowers the leftist arm or wing of the New World Order.
[54:45.000 --> 54:50.000]  If we only attack Barack Obama, then that empowers the phony controlled right wing arm.
[54:50.000 --> 54:56.000]  We have to show they're both puppet groups putting out different rhetoric, but carrying out the same operation.
[54:56.000 --> 55:03.000]  And Barack Obama is meant to fool the public into buying, stalling the public, not to revolt,
[55:03.000 --> 55:09.000]  just long enough to literally bankrupt the nation and bankrupt the dollar to the foreign banks.
[55:09.000 --> 55:16.000]  We are, quote, bailing out the very banks that control our private Federal Reserve that engineered the collapse.
[55:16.000 --> 55:17.000]  You understand?
[55:17.000 --> 55:22.000]  So that's why they didn't, quote, bail out mortgages, because it was never about the mortgages.
[55:22.000 --> 55:28.000]  It was about bankrupting the U.S. and capitalizing four U.S. banks, six foreign banks,
[55:28.000 --> 55:32.000]  to be able to go out and buy up and leverage the stock market.
[55:32.000 --> 55:36.000]  You mean co-verly, as if nobody would really know this as a voter,
[55:36.000 --> 55:43.000]  but behind the scenes, that's basically exactly what's boiling down as we're putting our, well, we aren't, but as everybody...
[55:43.000 --> 55:49.000]  Look, look, John McCain and Barack Obama, thank you for the call, are bought and paid for by the very same people.
[55:49.000 --> 55:54.000]  So they're just frontmen to deflect all the attention away from the real government.
[55:54.000 --> 55:58.000]  The President's ceremonial, the Congress is pretty much ceremonial.
[55:58.000 --> 56:02.000]  The Congress five weeks ago wouldn't pass the bank or takeover bill.
[56:02.000 --> 56:04.000]  So they were threatened with martial law.
[56:04.000 --> 56:05.000]  I played the C-span clips.
[56:05.000 --> 56:08.000]  They were told, we will arrest the Congress.
[56:08.000 --> 56:09.000]  Now that was total tyranny.
[56:09.000 --> 56:11.000]  They should have all walked out with the press conference.
[56:11.000 --> 56:14.000]  The President should have been arrested, but that ain't how it works here.
[56:14.000 --> 56:17.000]  Northcom's in control out of Colorado Springs.
[56:17.000 --> 56:20.000]  The Congress knows that, okay?
[56:20.000 --> 56:23.000]  And so people can't even believe it.
[56:23.000 --> 56:27.000]  If you read the U.S. government documents, the British Ministry of Defense documents,
[56:27.000 --> 56:29.000]  you know what would have happened if Congress would have walked out and said,
[56:29.000 --> 56:35.000]  we were just threatened with martial law and we're not going along with it anymore?
[56:35.000 --> 56:37.000]  Do you know what they would have done?
[56:37.000 --> 56:41.000]  Probably a neutron bomb would have been detonated in D.C.
[56:41.000 --> 56:47.000]  and the public would have been told that Al-Ciata, I mean Al-Qaeda did it.
[56:47.000 --> 56:53.000]  I mean, the British Ministry of Defense, in their 10-year report they put out last year saying what they believe will happen,
[56:53.000 --> 57:01.000]  they said governments may have to use neutron bombs to stop takeovers of our system.
[57:01.000 --> 57:04.000]  I mean, they're prepared to kill the whole Congress.
[57:04.000 --> 57:06.000]  Don't you understand?
[57:06.000 --> 57:11.000]  This is far beyond, far beyond anything you can deal with, what I can deal with.
[57:11.000 --> 57:14.000]  I can't handle it anymore.
[57:14.000 --> 57:15.000]  Okay?
[57:15.000 --> 57:17.000]  They're sucking the country dry right now.
[57:17.000 --> 57:20.000]  They're international offshore banks.
[57:20.000 --> 57:23.000]  They want it to fall apart. They want to hurt the economy.
[57:23.000 --> 57:26.000]  They want to destroy confidence.
[57:26.000 --> 57:28.000]  They're the military industrial complex.
[57:28.000 --> 57:30.000]  They're the new world order.
[57:30.000 --> 57:31.000]  They're offshore.
[57:31.000 --> 57:32.000]  They hate this country.
[57:32.000 --> 57:34.000]  They hate our founding fathers.
[57:34.000 --> 57:36.000]  You understand?
[57:36.000 --> 57:39.000]  All they're going to give you is a boot, stop it on your face forever.

[59:50.000 --> 59:54.000]  AO590 KLBJ Austin Tech.
[59:54.000 --> 1:00:03.000]  I already knew a fire that's posing perhaps the biggest threat in Southern California this morning is just 5% contained.
[1:00:03.000 --> 1:00:09.000]  After burning 11 square miles in Orange and Riverside counties since it erupted yesterday.
[1:00:09.000 --> 1:00:13.000]  Angela Garviso is with the Orange County Fire Authority.
[1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:18.000]  The winds remain erratic and gusty. Peak gusts about 45 miles per hour.
[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:24.000]  It's still warm and low humidity and obviously we have had a couple flare-ups overnight.
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  An Iraq's cabinet has approved a security pact with the United States that will let U.S. forces stay in Iraq for three more years.
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  Ali Alaba is an Iraqi government spokesman.
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  I think I'm optimistic that this agreement going to pass through the Council of Representatives as it is a national important issue,
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:47.000]  which is the best choice available for Iraq.
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  This is IRN USA Radio News.
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  I was drinking more than I should and I knew it.
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  I just made excuses and wrote it off as stress from work or problems at home.
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  I thought I was functional.
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  But then I realized that just being functional wasn't any kind of life at all.
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  That's when I heard about a free CD from the National Institute for Alcohol Recovery.
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  Turns out it's different from anything else out there including 12 step or hypnosis.
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  It's based on the latest research and it really turned things around for me.
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:24.000]  This free alcohol recovery CD works in the privacy of your own home.

[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  Police northeast of Baghdad report that seven people are dead and seven more may have been hurt.
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  Here's Christopher Torsche.
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  Sunday afternoon there was a suicide car bombing northeast of Baghdad in Indiana Province.
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  This military has different details saying the attack occurred at a police station and that four police and six civilians are dead.
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:20.000]  Even as more fighting is reported in eastern Congo, the main rebel leader in the African country is promising to support a ceasefire.
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:28.000]  He made the promise to a UN envoy who's also been talking in recent days with the country's president and with the leader of neighboring Angola.
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  And even the most die-hard Beatles fans have never heard this recording, but they may soon have the chance.
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:40.000]  Paul McCartney says it's time to release an experimental 14-minute track called Carnival of Light.
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  It included distorted guitar, gargling, and shouts of Barcelona.

[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:30.000]  Authorities and residents in Central North Carolina are assessing damage after a cluster of strong thunderstorms spawned tornadoes Saturday.
[1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  At least two people were killed and a child is reported missing.
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  This man says he and his wife had to run to the back of their mobile home to protect the children when the tornado hit.
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  After a one-month break, smoking is back in the Atlantic City casinos.
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  But it's possible that the decision could be reversed. Again, here's Shirley Smith.
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  The situation will be reviewed in a year to see if the economy has improved enough.
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  If so, the total ban might be put back in places.
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  In Space Shuttle, Endeavour is getting ready to meet up with the International Space Station 220 miles high into the sky.
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  Astronauts have about 14,000 pounds of home improvement equipment to unload as they prepare to remodel the space station.
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  This is NASA's Candrea Thomas.
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  Some of the equipment Endeavour's carrying to the space station includes a new space station.
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  Some of the equipment Endeavour's carrying to the space station includes a new exercise device called an advanced resistive exercise device.
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  Also a second toilet for the station, a galley or kitchen area.
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:46.000]  Two sleep stations for the crew and a water recycling system.
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  I'm Shirley Jordan for IRNUSA Radio News.

[1:06:17.000 --> 1:06:29.000]  590-5525, now live from Austin, Texas. Here's Alex Jones.
[1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:38.000]  By the way, if you don't believe me, you can go to prisonplanet.com and there is a news and focus section on the right hand side.
[1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:47.000]  And there's a headline in there about Fox News predicting total collapse of U.S. economy.
[1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:57.000]  Click on that and then it links to, that's the easiest way to find it, just because we reported on it a year ago,
[1:06:57.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  that was back in the news this week, the British military 10-year plan admitting they said the military works for the private banks
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:13.000]  that own our governments and own us and the New World Order and if governments, even governors, may try to revolt,
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  people may try to overthrow our system because, you know, the military announces in battle plans who they work for.
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  And they said we may have to use neutron weapons on the public.
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:30.000]  For those that don't know, it's a nuke, an airburst nuke, but it doesn't destroy any buildings, doesn't destroy any infrastructure,
[1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:35.000]  doesn't destroy the power lines, it radiates, it's a radiation pulse weapon.
[1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  It just would say I'm sitting here in Austin, Texas, one would detonate at about 3,000 feet, it would radiate the entire city,
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:47.000]  and everybody would die, including people a couple hundred feet under the ground.
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  And that's what neutron bombs were developed for in the United States and they've now been distributed around the world
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  to New World Order controlled countries.
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:08:03.000]  You have the city states in London, the city states, of course, in District of Columbia, those are the true ruling corporations.
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  To some extent, the ruling city over in Rome as well.
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  These are private incorporated systems and the entire weapons system is to be directed on free humanity
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  and they're in a mopping up operation taking over the last few third world countries where they don't have central banks
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:28.000]  controlled by the banking families in there that literally issue and control the currency to control the population.
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  So, I mean, I'm sorry, every reality is pretty scary, but there is no al-Qaeda, folks.
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:40.000]  They just call any terror group that fights against them al-Qaeda.
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  And most of the time they even control the terror groups.
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:46.000]  The terror group doesn't even know they're being financed by the New World Order,
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  so the New World Order has an excuse to go blow the living daylights out of a nation.
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:54.000]  And all of this is interconnected, but I said I'd go to your phone calls and I want to take a lot of them,
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:58.000]  but then I'm going to get into, well, I mean, go back to the radio show.
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:02.000]  The archives are up on infowars.com for free.
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  Go back to the shows I did five weeks ago and I told you exactly what was going to happen.
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  I said it'll be $5 trillion by the new year.
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:12.000]  These are foreign private banks.
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  They won't spend it on subprime mortgages because that's not the problem.
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:16.000]  There is no problem.
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  This is a heist, this is to get governmental power for the Treasury and the private Federal Reserve
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  to literally bankrupt the United States and bring us into a New World Order,
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  a basket of currencies where banking regulation is done by a private group of banks at the world government level.
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  And then Google today, New World Order Global Governance Banking or Banking Global Government.
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:44.000]  Hundreds, well, not hundreds, I typed in New World Order Friday and there were 59,000 under Google News.
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:46.000]  Mainstream news. I mean, look at these headlines.
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  G20 shaping a New World Order.
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:50.000]  New World Order agreed upon it.
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:52.000]  New Bretton Woods.
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  I mean, it's all over the news that the bankers, I told you, world government by the bankers,
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  armies in the past would go conquer people.
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:04.000]  This is economic conquest.
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  And of course I'm freaking out.
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  I mean, I'm so focused, so calm when I'm not on air doing my research.
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  And today I was doing all this research and just getting so upset and thinking,
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  no, I'm going to come in here and I'm going to calmly cover it.
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  But I can't.
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  Once I start talking about it, I get mad.
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  And again, that's triggered because I have all this data and I can't put it all out.
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  There's just too much of it.
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  There's too much proof.
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  All right, let's go to your calls.
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  Christian Las Vegas, thanks for holding her on the air worldwide.
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  This is it, Alex. Like 2007, 2008 was completion. Is this escalating so fast?
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  I don't know what to do.
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  But I just want to comment on a couple of things.
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  First of all, I just want to say that, I mean, I appreciate my brothers and my friends
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  and all the people who got me into this in W.O. about three or four years ago
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  because it wasn't for them and my true friends that I can talk to this on a database about.
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  I would probably be wearing a skintight hauler shirt right now.
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  I would probably be brainwashed.
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  I probably would have voted for McCain or Obama.
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  I mean, it's all about the people around you.
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  You need to unite and educate yourself and your friends and your family.
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  That's right. Person by person, you've got to...
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:16.000]  I mean, look, the government admits that most of the news is fake
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  and they're paying national and local news stations to tell you that
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  the government taking your children is good and that warrantless police checkpoints are good.
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  I mean, everything that Nazi Germany was is now happening.
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  But oh, we can't have a police state with a black president.
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  It is just crazy, but like I said, there's too much evidence.
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  There's too much proof, but you just need to stay up on it every day
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  and research from different sources to educate yourself
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  and find out what the next moves are.
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  Absolutely. Well, I mean, a lot of times people are emailing me going
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  and articles are being written saying,
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  yes, Mr. Jones, they're announcing a new world order,
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:58.000]  but it's not a government. It just means a new world system.
[1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  No. The Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, they're in the news.
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  I showed people the articles this week on the TV show and on the radio show
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  because we go live on the weekday show with video,
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  just like we're videotaping this, but we go live on the weekday.
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  I showed them major papers with Rothschild saying,
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  this is a world government run by the banks.
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  There it is. I mean, can you deny that they're taking your money?
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  Can you deny they're taking your pension fund money?
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  Can you deny? No, you can't deny. Stop denying.
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  I mean, they're local talk show hosts who I hear.
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:34.000]  I don't even listen to radio much.
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:36.000]  I tune in randomly and hear them talking bad about me.
[1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  How I'm crazy and I make stuff up. No, I'm normal.
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  Foreign banks orchestrate an economic collapse,
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:44.000]  tell everybody the economy's going to hell in a handbasket
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  to drive the market down. They openly terrorize the market,
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  which is confidence-built.
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  You know, it relies on confidence.
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  They drive it down and then say, oh, you didn't give us unlimited power.
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  That's why it went down.
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  And then Congress gives them unlimited criminal power.
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  It's totally illegitimate.
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:04.000]  And it's still going down because they're buying it all up,
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:08.000]  openly saying it's for world government, run by them.
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  And still, fake liberals, fake conservatives, Alex Jones.
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  Ha, ha, ha. Hey, man, this isn't funny.
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:17.000]  I'm freaked out, okay?
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  If I only cared about myself, I'd already got out of this country.
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  Okay? And I'm not saying I'm doing you a favor, folks,
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  because we're all tied together. I love humanity.
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  But let me tell you something. This isn't a game.
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  Do I have time to take one more?
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  All right, let's go ahead here and talk to Chris in Tennessee.
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  You're on the air.
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  Yes. Yes, I wanted to talk about the dumbing down
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  of the children and that kind of thing.
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  It's chemically done, yeah, fluoride.
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  Yes. And also, where they don't want to teach them
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:55.000]  the truth about civics and stuff, you know,
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  checks and balances, that kind of thing.
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:14:00.000]  No, they don't teach you about your rights
[1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:02.000]  or they don't teach you about freedom.
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  They teach you to look at what your race is
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  in the name of multiculturalism
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  so you really get all hung up on race,
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  so you're a neurotic weirdo who the media can control through guilt.
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  Yes.
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:16.000]  That's all you learn in school is how to go to jail,
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  how to be frisked, how to use drugs,
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  how to have sex, and how to live in a prison.
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:27.000]  Yes, and like I remember when I was 16,
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  I was driving one night and there was a roadblock,
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  the local sheriff's department, you know,
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  it was normal, well, I thought it was normal.
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:38.000]  Yeah, it's illegal.
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:40.000]  Checking for drunk drivers, you know.
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  I thought that was normal, but come to find out, you know,
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  a friend of mine said, no, that's not.
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  You know, your grandparents, my grandparents,
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  you know, that kind of thing didn't happen.
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  Look, I told everybody they're going to have statewide checkpoints
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  built in on the highways.
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  I had the federal documents and showed it in a film I made in 99
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:00.000]  called Police State 2000,
[1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  and now they're announcing all over the country
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:04.000]  warrantless checkpoints and they say,
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  don't worry, we're not going to stop the illegal aliens.
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:08.000]  They're above the law.
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  They don't have to have insurance and all this,
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  but let me give you a little secret.
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  They haven't told most of the cops yet.
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  They're already license plate scanning.
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  Everybody's license plate, where you go,
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:19.000]  what you do with AI cameras,
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  put in by the National Reconnaissance Office through FEMA
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  and the Austin cops.
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  They already can type in your insurance
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:28.000]  and find out if you really got it.
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  So the next time you lose your card,
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  they go ahead and give you a ticket.
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:34.000]  You can say to the cop, hey, I know you know I've really got insurance,
[1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  but they don't care.
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  It's about squeezing you and letting you know you're a slave
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  and the illegal alien, they don't get arrested for not having it.
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:46.000]  You, the schmuck, the cattle, the people there to bleed
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:48.000]  and suck off of, you do.
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:50.000]  We are their food.
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  I am so frustrated.
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  I can't seem to remember anything anymore.
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:54.000]  What?
[1:15:54.000 --> 1:15:57.000]  Seriously, my memory and attention span is terrible.
[1:15:57.000 --> 1:15:58.000]  I read something and forget.
[1:15:58.000 --> 1:15:59.000]  I forget people's names.
[1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:01.000]  I hear all this great information on the radio
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:03.000]  and I want to tell people, but I forget.
[1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:05.000]  Okay, slow down.
[1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:07.000]  Poor attention and memory loss is not your fault.
[1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:10.000]  Factors like fluoride in the water, aluminum and deodorants,
[1:16:10.000 --> 1:16:14.000]  genetically modified foods the way the education system taught you.
[1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:16.000]  It's all meant to dumb you down.
[1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:19.000]  You know, I can remember everything now, even entire books.
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:20.000]  What, how?
[1:16:20.000 --> 1:16:23.000]  There is this website called School of Phenomenal Memory.
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:25.000]  Their online course is a real breakthrough
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:27.000]  in the field of memory improvement.
[1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:29.000]  In fact, they guarantee that every single person
[1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:32.000]  will be able to memorize any type of information,
[1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:36.000]  including entire books after they complete just 60 lessons.
[1:16:36.000 --> 1:16:40.000]  And they offer a no questions asked, no time limit,
[1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:42.000]  money back guarantee.
[1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:43.000]  Wow, what's the website?
[1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:49.000]  Now, don't forget, it's pmemory.net, the letter P, memory.net.
[1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:52.000]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years
[1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:54.000]  hoping to build up enough wealth to retire
[1:16:54.000 --> 1:16:56.000]  and live out their golden years.
[1:16:56.000 --> 1:16:59.000]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food,
[1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:01.000]  energy, housing and medical,
[1:17:01.000 --> 1:17:04.000]  many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:06.000]  Is this a flaw for enterprise?
[1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:08.000]  Or is our monetary unit, we call the Federal Reserve Note,
[1:17:08.000 --> 1:17:10.000]  forcing us into perpetual debt,
[1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:12.000]  ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:14.000]  These questions and more can be answered
[1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:16.000]  by reading G. Edward Griffin's book,
[1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:17.000]  The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:19.000]  Congressman Ron Paul states,
[1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:22.000]  it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:25.000]  A gripping adventure into the secret world
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:27.000]  of international banking cartel.
[1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:28.000]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:30.000]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s
[1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:32.000]  to anyone who purchases this book.

[1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:40.000]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:49.000]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:51.000]  Everyone knows that omega 3
[1:17:51.000 --> 1:17:53.000]  should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[1:17:53.000 --> 1:17:55.000]  With so many different methods of consumption,
[1:17:55.000 --> 1:17:57.000]  how do you choose a simple yet effective way
[1:17:57.000 --> 1:17:59.000]  to get your daily intake?
[1:17:59.000 --> 1:18:02.000]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American nutrition
[1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:03.000]  have the answer.
[1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:06.000]  Nature's Gem, premium omega 3.
[1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:07.000]  Unlike other flax seed,
[1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:10.000]  our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota,
[1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:13.000]  providing cooler temperatures and longer summer hours,
[1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:17.000]  producing the highest quality premium golden flax seed around.
[1:18:17.000 --> 1:18:19.000]  In addition, we selectively harvest
[1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:22.000]  and sort flax seeds by size and weight,
[1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:23.000]  keeping only the best seeds
[1:18:23.000 --> 1:18:26.000]  that can produce the highest abundance of omega 3.
[1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:29.000]  The result is a delicious, nutty, buttery flavor.
[1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:31.000]  Nature's Gem golden flax is pure.
[1:18:31.000 --> 1:18:35.000]  There is nothing added and nothing taken away and non-GMO.

[1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:51.000]  Are you one of the people who think,
[1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:52.000]  I have plenty of time,
[1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:54.000]  nothing's ever gonna happen bad to me.
[1:18:54.000 --> 1:18:56.000]  Do you believe that when your cupboards are bare,
[1:18:56.000 --> 1:18:59.000]  our corporate controlled government will jump right in to feed you and yours?
[1:18:59.000 --> 1:19:02.000]  Do you have at least a year's supply of food for your family?
[1:19:02.000 --> 1:19:05.000]  This is Kurt, the armchair survivalist, heard on this network.
[1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:08.000]  Survival enterprises sells real food, canned for long-term storage.
[1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:10.000]  Beef, chicken, turkey, bacon, butter, cheese, eggs,
[1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:12.000]  freeze-dried fruits and vegetables,
[1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:14.000]  Mountain House freeze-dried meals, MREs,
[1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:16.000]  a full nutritional line,
[1:19:16.000 --> 1:19:18.000]  the British Birkfeld water filter, and more.
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:21.000]  If you want to prepare now, go to beforeitstoolate.us.
[1:19:21.000 --> 1:19:23.000]  That's before itstoolate.us.
[1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:26.000]  Or call 1-800-753-1981.
[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:29.000]  That's 1-800-753-1981.
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:33.000]  Or you can put your head in the sand and be just another sheeple in the corporate controlled flock.
[1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:37.000]  But remember, those who don't learn from history are bound to repeat it.
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:56.000]  Are you tired of searching for KREG TALK radio?
[1:19:56.000 --> 1:20:09.000]  Search no more. We are the GCN Radio Network.
[1:20:09.000 --> 1:20:13.000]  All right, I want to walk through the hearings I watched Thursday and Friday
[1:20:13.000 --> 1:20:17.000]  in the House and Senate on banking.
[1:20:17.000 --> 1:20:21.000]  They're on, right now, still on C-SPAN. They're re-hearing them.
[1:20:21.000 --> 1:20:23.000]  Unbelievable. I mean, they just came right out and said,
[1:20:23.000 --> 1:20:26.000]  yeah, we stole all the money. There's nothing you can do about it.
[1:20:26.000 --> 1:20:35.000]  The exact number I told you, 5 trillion.
[1:20:35.000 --> 1:20:38.000]  5 trillion.
[1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:41.000]  You can read the subsection where it says no one can review it.
[1:20:41.000 --> 1:20:44.000]  No one can look at it. No one can question it.
[1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:46.000]  And Kashkari would remind them. He would say,
[1:20:46.000 --> 1:20:50.000]  you know about subsections such and such.
[1:20:50.000 --> 1:20:53.000]  And he would just smile and just laugh at the House.
[1:20:53.000 --> 1:20:58.000]  Just laughing. You are our slaves.
[1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:05.000]  See, it's important in psychological warfare for them to let the Congress know their ceremonial.
[1:21:05.000 --> 1:21:08.000]  Let's talk to George in Texas. You're on the air. Welcome.
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  How are you doing, Alex?
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  Oh, I'm pretty freaked out. I mean, this is moving faster than I thought,
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:15.000]  where they openly steal 5 trillion and say,
[1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:18.000]  we're keeping it all and no one can be told where it's going.
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:20.000]  And we're setting up a world government.
[1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:23.000]  And then the yuppies are stumbling around still acting stylish.
[1:21:23.000 --> 1:21:25.000]  Well, did you hear about they're going to say,
[1:21:25.000 --> 1:21:28.000]  do away with the Texas Youth Commission and give it another name,
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:30.000]  but still keep the same rape rooms?
[1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:33.000]  Yeah. I mean, the Texas Rangers found out that they would have these public rapings
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:37.000]  and the judges and locals and police would pull up to rape the children.
[1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:39.000]  They have public fight nights and the rest of it.
[1:21:39.000 --> 1:21:43.000]  And then the state police got in trouble for trying to expose it.
[1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:47.000]  And that's why the state police, the inside skinny, are being overthrown now
[1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:51.000]  because they're not fully controlled by the, by the pedophile rings.
[1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:56.000]  And by the way, I'm not joking all over the country from Florida to Michigan to California.
[1:21:56.000 --> 1:21:59.000]  I mean, how many Homeland Security deputy heads have we heard who get caught
[1:21:59.000 --> 1:22:01.000]  raping little kids or trying to?
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:03.000]  Because you see the whole government isn't bad.
[1:22:03.000 --> 1:22:06.000]  So cops keep busting the other cops doing it.
[1:22:06.000 --> 1:22:09.000]  But it's always the officials seeing, I mean, you got to be scum.
[1:22:09.000 --> 1:22:14.000]  You got to be a, I mean, look in Rome, pedophile rings ran it.
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:16.000]  I mean, it's always the same in history.
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:21.000]  Well, Alex, I talked to a Texas Ranger at work who comes and gets coffee.
[1:22:21.000 --> 1:22:25.000]  He told me that he told me he arrested more people with honor
[1:22:25.000 --> 1:22:27.000]  than the people that are putting in the Texas Rangers
[1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:30.000]  than they even qualified to wash their cars.
[1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:33.000]  No, I know it was the Texas Rangers in West Texas first found out about it.
[1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:34.000]  That's why I said state police.
[1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:36.000]  They're technically part of the state police.
[1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:42.000]  And then, I mean, listen, listen, who wants to be in a foster home with little kids?
[1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:44.000]  And I don't mean your average foster parent.
[1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:46.000]  I mean, some of them are okay, but statistically,
[1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:48.000]  the child's five times more likely to be abused.
[1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:50.000]  Congressional reports on that.
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:51.000]  Adjust department numbers.
[1:22:51.000 --> 1:22:52.000]  Just pull up.
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:53.000]  Rates of child abuse.
[1:22:53.000 --> 1:22:56.000]  Government five times more likely it'll pop up for you.
[1:22:56.000 --> 1:22:59.000]  But somewhere it's even higher, but it's a national average.
[1:22:59.000 --> 1:23:01.000]  But these facilities where they have the youth,
[1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:04.000]  who do you think wants to go work in a youth facility?
[1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:06.000]  A big fat pedophile.
[1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:08.000]  That's right.
[1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:09.000]  Oh, well, God bless, Alex.
[1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:10.000]  Keep up the good work.
[1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:11.000]  Yeah, God bless you.
[1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:13.000]  Yeah, the government isn't the government.
[1:23:13.000 --> 1:23:14.000]  Criminals took it over.
[1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:16.000]  Then they got more criminals in,
[1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:19.000]  and they're trying to kick everybody good out of government.
[1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:21.000]  Okay, that's how this works.
[1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:23.000]  You understand, we're in trouble.
[1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:24.000]  Mayday.
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:26.000]  America is in crisis, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:28.000]  It happens all the time in other nations.
[1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:29.000]  It happened here.
[1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:30.000]  Evil took over.
[1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:31.000]  They don't have full control.
[1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:32.000]  I'm on the air.
[1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:33.000]  Other people are on the air.
[1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:34.000]  That's another example.
[1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:36.000]  The state police tried to stop it,
[1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:39.000]  and the whole thing got covered up.
[1:23:39.000 --> 1:23:42.000]  I mean, folks, just around Austin,
[1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:44.000]  they've shut down three prisons that I know of,
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:46.000]  and I'm not even paying attention to local news.
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:48.000]  I'm paying attention to international and national.
[1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:51.000]  I mean, they had some women's prison out in Bastrop
[1:23:51.000 --> 1:23:53.000]  run by a private group.
[1:23:53.000 --> 1:23:54.000]  You can just Google it.
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:23:56.000]  And it said they were making Porto videos,
[1:23:56.000 --> 1:23:58.000]  raping the women in bondage rooms,
[1:23:58.000 --> 1:24:00.000]  and it said they raped all the women
[1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:04.000]  because the guards thought that that was how it should be done.
[1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:05.000]  And guess what?
[1:24:05.000 --> 1:24:06.000]  They just lost their contract,
[1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:10.000]  and nobody went to prison.
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:12.000]  I mean, that's the thing.
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:14.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, hell has been real,
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:17.000]  and then I can't even keep track of it all.
[1:24:17.000 --> 1:24:20.000]  You know who they hired for Abu Ghraib and Camp X-ray
[1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:22.000]  and these black sites, secret sites,
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:23.000]  ghost sites all around the world?
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:27.000]  It came out in congressional testimony that they hired
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:30.000]  former federal and state prison guards
[1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:32.000]  who've been disciplined or kicked out
[1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:37.000]  for raping and torture.
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:41.000]  By the way, Barack Obama has announced the black sites stay open,
[1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:43.000]  that is the secret black op torture facilities,
[1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:46.000]  the ghost sites, they all stay open.
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:50.000]  It all stays open, the spying on American citizens,
[1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:52.000]  it all stays open.
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:54.000]  I mean, what did you think was going to happen?
[1:24:54.000 --> 1:24:58.000]  And see, for eight years,
[1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:00.000]  you know, under Bill Clinton, I'm an evil right winger.
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:02.000]  Now under Bush, I'm a liberal.
[1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:03.000]  Now all these conservative grips,
[1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:05.000]  oh, you're good again, you don't like Obama.
[1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:07.000]  You idiots, these guys are puppets,
[1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:08.000]  they don't run anything, okay?
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  I'm not talking to the general audience when I say you idiots.
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  I'm telling people out there,
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:14.000]  I'm not making this stuff up.
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:15.000]  If you're tuning in for the first time,
[1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:17.000]  this isn't a game, pal.
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:18.000]  You understand?
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:21.000]  We're all in grave danger right now.
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:24.000]  Keith in New York, you're on the air, go ahead.
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:26.000]  Hey, how are you doing tonight?
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:28.000]  I'm just fired up as usual.
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:32.000]  Yeah, so I've been a member of these Yahoo message boards
[1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:35.000]  for Yahoo Finance for about five or six years now.
[1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:37.000]  I'm 24 years old.
[1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:39.000]  And for the past few years,
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  I've been learning about the markets,
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  learning about the economy.
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:45.000]  May of last year, I was putting some posts on there
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:47.000]  saying markets are inflated
[1:25:47.000 --> 1:25:51.000]  and things should drop 20, 30%, yada, yada.
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:53.000]  And about a week ago,
[1:25:53.000 --> 1:25:55.000]  a few years ago, I went online,
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:25:57.000]  replied to all my posts, brought them up to date.
[1:25:57.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  Magically the next day, Yahoo deleted everything.
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:02.000]  And lately, I had talked about it in there,
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:05.000]  about the martial law I had seen online.
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:08.000]  Yeah, listen, they don't want people to realize
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:11.000]  that Ron Paul and myself and you and millions of others
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:13.000]  were dead on.
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:15.000]  Because see, Obama's going to get in,
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:17.000]  they're going to say, yeah, the banks misuse some of the money.
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:19.000]  They stole 10 trillion.
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:21.000]  Watch, that'll be the number you hear in about a year.
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:22.000]  And it'll really be about 20.
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:25.000]  But the point is, I told you by Christmas it'd be 5 trillion.
[1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:26.000]  It happens sooner than I said.
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:28.000]  But the point is, I read the bill,
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:30.000]  but that's how they're going to do it.
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:32.000]  Oh, that's the past with Obama.
[1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:33.000]  Obama's here now.
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:35.000]  Oh, they stole 10 trillion, but so what?
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:37.000]  Let's move on now.
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:39.000]  The government's going to save you with a carbon tax
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:41.000]  to shut down your job.
[1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  And then you can go work for the government.
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:46.000]  I saw on PBS today, Robert Kennedy say,
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:48.000]  we're going to give you a job
[1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:50.000]  enforcing the new environmental laws.
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:52.000]  I mean, they're just going to hire millions.
[1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:54.000]  They said 3 million of these goons.
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:56.000]  So we've got Yahoo and Google now
[1:26:56.000 --> 1:26:58.000]  taking away my freedom of speech on us.
[1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:00.000]  Sir, Australian government has announced
[1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:03.000]  they're going to ban almost all political sites.
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:06.000]  Just, it's happening here.
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:08.000]  They're blocking us out all over England.
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:10.000]  You can't get to prismplanet.com and infowars.com
[1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  on government broadband systems, government facilities.
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:15.000]  Yes, because they're a pack of criminals
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:17.000]  and they can't have us exposing them.
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:19.000]  You know what they're doing to my videos all over YouTube?
[1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:21.000]  People take the audio and put it up.
[1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  They're going and filing and saying it's adult content
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:28.000]  to have it blocked so people can't hear it.
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:30.000]  See, they're scared of the truth.
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:32.000]  They're making their move.
[1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:34.000]  They staged the terror attacks
[1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:36.000]  so they'd have their police state in place
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:38.000]  so they could then loot the treasury
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:40.000]  and get away with it and then suppress us.
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:43.000]  And here's AP today saying
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:47.000]  that the police state is for the American people.
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:50.000]  How come I'm 24 and I understand these things
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  and what's going on in the country I'm growing up in,
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:54.000]  everyone else in this country seems to be pretty blocked?
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:56.000]  Because they're a nation that bought into the fad culture
[1:27:56.000 --> 1:27:58.000]  of believing whatever the news says is right
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:00.000]  and being like everybody else
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:02.000]  and so they can't admit they've been lied to.
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:04.000]  They can't admit they've been set up.
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:06.000]  They can't admit they're being taken to the cleaners.
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  Their instinct is to grovel to authority
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  and so a lot of them actually know it's true
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:12.000]  but they're going to try to get a black uniform.
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  They're going to try to come take your house.
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:16.000]  They're going to try to be your boss.
[1:28:16.000 --> 1:28:18.000]  A lot of them know what's going on.
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:20.000]  They're going to join the evil.
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  You understand?
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:24.000]  Yeah.
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:26.000]  You bet. A lot of them are cowards
[1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:28.000]  and can't admit what they're part of.
[1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:30.000]  Security focuses on protesters more than terror
[1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:32.000]  because the nation's anti-terror forces
[1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  are mainly focusing on the American people
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:36.000]  and protest and people out of work.
[1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:38.000]  See, it was all for you.
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:40.000]  AP, it's all for you
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:42.000]  so they can have the heist
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:44.000]  and steal everything you've got.
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:46.000]  Offshore banks run the government.
[1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:50.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:52.000]  Honey, have you seen the remote?
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:54.000]  Sweetie, have you seen my car keys?
[1:28:54.000 --> 1:28:56.000]  I can't find my wallet.
[1:28:56.000 --> 1:28:58.000]  Sound familiar?
[1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:00.000]  Why not save time looking for lost things
[1:29:00.000 --> 1:29:02.000]  and lose the stress instead?

[1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:22.000]  FOFA goes through walls, cushions and laundry baskets
[1:29:22.000 --> 1:29:24.000]  up to 30 feet
[1:29:24.000 --> 1:29:26.000]  and projects a clear 90 plus decibel beep.
[1:29:26.000 --> 1:29:28.000]  Got the remote.
[1:29:28.000 --> 1:29:30.000]  Oh, my keys.

[1:29:54.000 --> 1:29:56.000]  finding the right gift can be tough.

[1:30:48.000 --> 1:30:50.000]  for the new year.
[1:30:50.000 --> 1:30:52.000]  Hello, I'm Steve Shank.
[1:30:52.000 --> 1:30:54.000]  We're entering a holiday season
[1:30:54.000 --> 1:30:56.000]  never before seen in America.
[1:30:56.000 --> 1:30:58.000]  We're thankful for the warning
[1:30:58.000 --> 1:31:00.000]  given by members of Mr Obama's campaign team
[1:31:00.000 --> 1:31:02.000]  of the coming international incident
[1:31:02.000 --> 1:31:04.000]  which will force unpopular decisions.
[1:31:04.000 --> 1:31:06.000]  Without this warning
[1:31:06.000 --> 1:31:08.000]  many of us who still have money available
[1:31:08.000 --> 1:31:10.000]  would have unknowingly wasted on a Christmas gifts
[1:31:10.000 --> 1:31:12.000]  that will be useless
[1:31:12.000 --> 1:31:14.000]  when the only food available
[1:31:14.000 --> 1:31:16.000]  is in a government bread line.
[1:31:16.000 --> 1:31:18.000]  When the president is faced with the expected
[1:31:18.000 --> 1:31:20.000]  national security incident
[1:31:20.000 --> 1:31:22.000]  the in place patriot legislation
[1:31:22.000 --> 1:31:24.000]  will control transport and distribution of food.
[1:31:24.000 --> 1:31:26.000]  Those of us who are able
[1:31:26.000 --> 1:31:28.000]  to take care of ourselves
[1:31:28.000 --> 1:31:30.000]  must put in supplies of food.
[1:31:30.000 --> 1:31:32.000]  This will free up the relief organizations
[1:31:32.000 --> 1:31:34.000]  to give food to those unable
[1:31:34.000 --> 1:31:36.000]  to prepare. The greatest gift this Christmas
[1:31:36.000 --> 1:31:38.000]  is life itself.
[1:31:38.000 --> 1:31:40.000]  Food for these unknown times.
[1:31:40.000 --> 1:31:42.000]  Call 800-409-5633

[1:32:16.000 --> 1:32:18.000]  Thank you so much for watching.
[1:32:46.000 --> 1:32:50.000]  888-949-3570
[1:33:16.000 --> 1:33:18.000]  Thank you very much.
[1:33:46.000 --> 1:33:48.000]  Live there
[1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:50.000]  on the mode of dust
[1:33:50.000 --> 1:33:52.000]  suspended in a sunbeam.
[1:33:54.000 --> 1:33:56.000]  Think of the rivers of blood
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:33:58.000]  spilled by all those generals
[1:33:58.000 --> 1:34:00.000]  and emperors
[1:34:00.000 --> 1:34:02.000]  so that in
[1:34:02.000 --> 1:34:04.000]  glory and triumph
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:06.000]  they could become the momentary masters
[1:34:06.000 --> 1:34:08.000]  of a fraction
[1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:18.000]  of a thought.
[1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:20.000]  Alright folks, that's the first
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:22.000]  two minutes, or minute and a half
[1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:24.000]  of the video.
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:26.000]  The final push for world government
[1:34:26.000 --> 1:34:28.000]  by a great YouTube channel
[1:34:28.000 --> 1:34:30.000]  AnnaFroy87
[1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:32.000]  and a whole bunch of his videos
[1:34:32.000 --> 1:34:34.000]  with myself in it, I'm at the end of the video
[1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:36.000]  are only for adults
[1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:38.000]  to see or their band.
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:40.000]  Now that's what YouTube thinks
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:42.000]  you're not allowed to hear.
[1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:44.000]  Uplifting incredible
[1:34:44.000 --> 1:34:46.000]  mind expanding
[1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:48.000]  information about thinking
[1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:50.000]  about how finite we are
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:52.000]  but through that finiteness connecting
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:54.000]  to our past, our present, our future
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  who we are
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:34:58.000]  on this planet. See, you can't hear
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:00.000]  things like that. You're not supposed
[1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:02.000]  to hear things like that.
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:04.000]  No, you're supposed to think about
[1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:06.000]  petty mindless things that won't matter
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:08.000]  today or tomorrow like a football game.
[1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:10.000]  While
[1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:12.000]  a scientific dictatorship
[1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:14.000]  programs you with advertising
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:16.000]  technologies and brainwashes
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:18.000]  you to where the person
[1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:20.000]  you think you are isn't even who you are.
[1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:24.000]  Let's play Dr. Michael Kaufman
[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:26.000]  from Endgame 1.5
[1:35:26.000 --> 1:35:28.000]  again the DVD film, two hours
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:30.000]  and a half long and an hour of extras.
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:32.000]  These were extra extras we put on
[1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:34.000]  line at prisonplanet.tv
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:36.000]  and here's Dr. Kaufman
[1:35:36.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  reading from a major university study
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:40.000]  U.S. government funded in the
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:42.000]  60s about how they would
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:44.000]  control us and drug us and enslave us.
[1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:46.000]  And then here we are
[1:35:46.000 --> 1:35:48.000]  Hold on a minute.
[1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:50.000]  I'm not quite ready to go into that, sorry.
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:54.000]  Here they are describing
[1:35:54.000 --> 1:35:56.000]  I mean there's thousands of these government
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:35:58.000]  documents and textbooks where they say
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:00.000]  they're putting fluoride in your water
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:02.000]  to sterilize you
[1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:04.000]  and to
[1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:06.000]  hurt you and then it's a toxic sedative.
[1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:10.000]  There are thousands of these
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:12.000]  where they admit that they would get us all
[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  in debt, that implode our currency
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:16.000]  and then bring in a world government run by the banks.
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:18.000]  I mean I read that from the 50s
[1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  and the 60s and the 70s and then they said
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:22.000]  in the 70s that we'll
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:24.000]  do this
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:26.000]  by around 2005, 2010
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:28.000]  I mean we're on a plan
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:30.000]  and that's why
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:32.000]  I'm just an average guy from Texas
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:34.000]  who learned about all this and I'm like
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:36.000]  why don't people care?
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:38.000]  Look at the airplanes and the technology
[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:40.000]  and the cell phones and all of it, folks
[1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:42.000]  the technology is even more advanced than that
[1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:44.000]  and the social engineers they do care
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:46.000]  they are in control.
[1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:48.000]  Play Dr. Michael Kaufman.
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:50.000]  Back in 1965
[1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:52.000]  the Department of Health and Education and
[1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  Welfare, HEW
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:56.000]  sponsored a study
[1:36:56.000 --> 1:36:58.000]  on how they're going to get from where
[1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:00.000]  they were then in 1965
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:02.000]  to where we are now in the 21st century.
[1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:04.000]  They came out with a report in 1969
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:06.000]  called the Behavioral Science Teacher Education
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:08.000]  Program
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:10.000]  that's now fully integrated within our educational
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:12.000]  program and this is what they said
[1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:14.000]  and I want to have you hang on to your hats
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:16.000]  because you will not believe what they plan
[1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:18.000]  to do back in 1965-69
[1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:20.000]  and what is happening actually
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:22.000]  today.
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:24.000]  He said calculations of the future
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:26.000]  are no longer considered to be an obscure
[1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:28.000]  academic pursuit.
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:30.000]  Long-range planning and implementation of
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:32.000]  plans will be made by a technological
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:34.000]  scientific elite. This will strain
[1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:36.000]  the democratic fabric to the ripping point.
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  The Protestant ethic will
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:40.000]  atrophy as more and more enjoyed
[1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:42.000]  a varied, lasured and guaranteed sustenance.
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  Work as a means
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:46.000]  and an end of living will diminish.
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:48.000]  Most people will tend to be hedonistic
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:50.000]  and a dominant elite will provide
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:52.000]  the bread and circuses to keep social
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:54.000]  dissension and disruption to at a minimum.
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:56.000]  A small elite will carry
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:37:58.000]  society's burdens.
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:00.000]  The resulting impersonal manipulation
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:02.000]  of most people's lifestyles will be
[1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  softened by provision for pleasure-seeking
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:06.000]  and guaranteed physical necessities.
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:08.000]  The controlling elite will engage
[1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:10.000]  in power plays largely without the
[1:38:10.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  involvement of most of the people
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:14.000]  and that is so true today.
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:16.000]  Most people have no idea what's going on
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:18.000]  in the international arena, have none.
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:20.000]  Almost all of this is being done in secrecy.
[1:38:20.000 --> 1:38:22.000]  Going on with this report,
[1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:24.000]  the society will be a leisurely one.
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:26.000]  People will study, play and travel.
[1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:28.000]  Some will be in various stages of
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:30.000]  drug-induced experiences.
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  Each individual will receive at birth
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:34.000]  a multi-purpose identification
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:36.000]  which will have, amongst other things,
[1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  extensive communications and control uses.
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  Each individual will be saturated
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:42.000]  with ideas of information.
[1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  Each will be self-selected.
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:46.000]  Other kinds will be imposed
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:48.000]  overtly by those who assume the
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:50.000]  possibility for the other's actions.
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:52.000]  Relatively few individuals will be
[1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:54.000]  able to maintain control over their opinions.
[1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:56.000]  Most will be pawns of competing
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:38:58.000]  opinion-molders.
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:00.000]  It's amazing how
[1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:02.000]  back in the 1960s they began
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:04.000]  the process of getting us to where
[1:39:04.000 --> 1:39:06.000]  we are right now. If you look at society
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:08.000]  today, almost every one of the
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:10.000]  characteristics that I've read
[1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:12.000]  have come true. Let's stop right there.
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:14.000]  That's from in game 1.5.
[1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:16.000]  Did you hear that?
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:18.000]  They say that over and over again. In thousands
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:20.000]  of government documents I've read,
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:22.000]  you don't control what you think.
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:24.000]  See, you out there laughing, you're driving back
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:26.000]  from football game, feeling tough,
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:28.000]  you've got this false template
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:30.000]  using your mammalian programming,
[1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  using your natural instincts that have gone
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:34.000]  in and programmed through those
[1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  to literally devolve who you are
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:38.000]  so you never become empowered,
[1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:40.000]  you never become self-actualized or conscious.
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:42.000]  And then Bill Joy,
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:44.000]  there's thousands of examples, but I'll use this one
[1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:46.000]  fine. April issue 2000,
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:48.000]  Why the Future Doesn't Need Us,
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:50.000]  Wired Magazine, owner of some
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:52.000]  microsystems worth
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:54.000]  however many billions. He goes to
[1:39:54.000 --> 1:39:56.000]  a globalist meeting, he comes out
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:39:58.000]  and he goes, my God,
[1:39:58.000 --> 1:40:00.000]  they're planning to kill the majority
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:02.000]  of the public. See, they decided
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:04.000]  we're not going to have everybody living
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:06.000]  in leisure and all this stuff with the technology.
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:08.000]  We're going to go ahead and just build a police
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:10.000]  state grid, use fake terror to get them
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:12.000]  clamped down, then implode the economy,
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:14.000]  then bring in even more control, then
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:16.000]  have controlled bioweapon releases.
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  And they just
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:20.000]  put this in a magazine
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:22.000]  right in your face.
[1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:24.000]  And then I'm weird
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:26.000]  because I'll come in here and give you chapter
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:28.000]  and verse and date and document
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:30.000]  in your face.
[1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:32.000]  Oh, God, help us.
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:34.000]  I mean, I
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:36.000]  feel connected to all humanity.
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:38.000]  I love everybody. It was a beautiful
[1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:40.000]  day today. I love my children, my wife.
[1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:42.000]  I want to help people.
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:44.000]  I'm not a cold-blooded bastard and I know
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:46.000]  this stuff and the slaves
[1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:48.000]  will laugh at you when you warn them.
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:50.000]  They want to be slaves. They want
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:52.000]  to be dumb. They want
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:54.000]  because they have been taught to love
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:56.000]  the false template they're living in.
[1:40:58.000 --> 1:41:00.000]  They have been taught to love the false
[1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:02.000]  paradigm they've been conditioned into.
[1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:04.000]  Now, a lot of them are waking up folks, but
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:06.000]  I mean, I can tell
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:08.000]  you two and a half years ago that they're going to pop the
[1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:10.000]  prime mortgage, but that won't really be the cause
[1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:12.000]  and that they're going to take over and still trillions
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:14.000]  because we go cover the elite meetings.
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:16.000]  I mean,
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:18.000]  I have like foreign intelligence agencies following
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:20.000]  me around every day now folks. We have it on video.
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:22.000]  I mean, I'm living
[1:41:22.000 --> 1:41:24.000]  in Twilight Zone to bring you
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:26.000]  this information. It all happens. I tell
[1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:28.000]  you five weeks ago exactly what's going to happen.
[1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:30.000]  Exactly what I say is going to happen is going to happen
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:32.000]  because these bastards are all
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:34.000]  public about it. They said in 1974
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:36.000]  in the Trilateral Commission
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:38.000]  minutes that were declassified in the mid-80s
[1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:40.000]  that
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:42.000]  of Jimmy Carter's administration that we're going to do all
[1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:44.000]  this. These people
[1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:46.000]  are in control. Do you
[1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:48.000]  got it? They're
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:50.000]  eugenicist. They're neo
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:52.000]  feudal lords and if you don't know what neo feudalism
[1:41:52.000 --> 1:41:54.000]  is, you better find out real fast.
[1:41:54.000 --> 1:41:56.000]  Let me tell you that
[1:41:56.000 --> 1:41:58.000]  Titans
[1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:00.000]  game today
[1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:02.000]  didn't matter. That Red Sox
[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:04.000]  game, you know, ain't going to matter in six months.
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:06.000]  None of that matters folks. It doesn't matter.
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:08.000]  It doesn't matter.
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:10.000]  All right, let's take a call before we
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:12.000]  get a break here.
[1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:14.000]  We're going to come back and I'm going to just accelerate through your calls.
[1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:16.000]  Mike,
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:18.000]  Teresa
[1:42:18.000 --> 1:42:20.000]  and others. We're going to get to everybody. Loaded phone
[1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:22.000]  lines here. Just give each caller about a minute or so.
[1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:24.000]  I meant to get more into the bailout, but whatever.
[1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:26.000]  If you don't want to believe me, if you don't want to check into it,
[1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:28.000]  that was really a foreign banking takeover
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:30.000]  that they're openly announcing world
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:32.000]  government run by the banks. She'll pay your
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:34.000]  government taxes into them. Both parties
[1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:36.000]  and every major nation are for it.
[1:42:36.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  I mean, my God, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:40.000]  if you won't listen to me, there's nothing
[1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:42.000]  I can do. I can't help you.
[1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:44.000]  You can watch my film in game for free
[1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:46.000]  by the way online or get the DVD
[1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:48.000]  at infowars.com. Just google in game
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:43:03.000]  for God's sakes, please.
[1:43:49.000 --> 1:43:52.000]  Honey, have you seen the remote?
[1:43:52.000 --> 1:43:54.000]  Sweetie, have you seen my car keys?
[1:43:54.000 --> 1:44:20.000]  I can't find my wallet.
[1:44:20.000 --> 1:44:29.000]  Oh, my keys.
[1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:51.000]  There's my wallet.
[1:44:51.000 --> 1:45:07.000]  I can't find my wallet.
[1:45:07.000 --> 1:45:32.000]  I can't find my wallet.
[1:45:32.000 --> 1:45:50.000]  I can't find my wallet.
[1:45:50.000 --> 1:46:16.000]  I can't find my wallet.
[1:46:16.000 --> 1:46:38.000]  I can't find my wallet.
[1:46:38.000 --> 1:47:07.000]  I can't find my wallet.
[1:47:07.000 --> 1:47:09.000]  Oh, yeah, this country's running with
[1:47:09.000 --> 1:47:11.000]  the devil in a big way and it's not cute
[1:47:11.000 --> 1:47:13.000]  and it's not funny. I'm going to take a
[1:47:13.000 --> 1:47:15.000]  bunch of final calls here at the end.
[1:47:15.000 --> 1:47:18.000]  But in closing, Texas
[1:47:18.000 --> 1:47:20.000]  agency wants to set up statewide
[1:47:20.000 --> 1:47:22.000]  driver's license checkpoints.
[1:47:22.000 --> 1:47:25.000]  Now, they've done this all over the
[1:47:25.000 --> 1:47:27.000]  country. They claim it's free legal,
[1:47:27.000 --> 1:47:29.000]  but the state police never said that.
[1:47:29.000 --> 1:47:31.000]  They said, no, it's for everybody, insurance,
[1:47:31.000 --> 1:47:33.000]  driver's license, and they even started
[1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:35.000]  saying, well, don't worry, we're not going
[1:47:35.000 --> 1:47:37.000]  to let them go.
[1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:39.000]  I've had many folks and I've had
[1:47:39.000 --> 1:47:41.000]  Austin cops admit this to me and
[1:47:41.000 --> 1:47:43.000]  the police have been on the news.
[1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:45.000]  Sheriff's departments, will they arrest
[1:47:45.000 --> 1:47:47.000]  illegals? The citizen will be arrested
[1:47:47.000 --> 1:47:49.000]  for driving drunk with no ID and
[1:47:49.000 --> 1:47:51.000]  no insurance, but they let them go
[1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:53.000]  because the judges just let them go
[1:47:53.000 --> 1:47:55.000]  because ICE won't come pick them up.
[1:47:55.000 --> 1:47:57.000]  But because this might stop
[1:47:57.000 --> 1:47:59.000]  the illegal alien, government said
[1:47:59.000 --> 1:48:01.000]  you're not doing it. See, again, they
[1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:03.000]  want checkpoints, but it will stop
[1:48:03.000 --> 1:48:05.000]  and that's a big part of the New World Order
[1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:07.000]  is having these open borders. And I'm not
[1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:09.000]  against the poor, desperate Third World
[1:48:09.000 --> 1:48:11.000]  people that want to come here for a better job.
[1:48:11.000 --> 1:48:13.000]  I'm sorry, though, if it's part of the
[1:48:13.000 --> 1:48:15.000]  New World Order plan, I'm against it.
[1:48:15.000 --> 1:48:17.000]  It's real simple. Let's talk to Mike and
[1:48:17.000 --> 1:48:19.000]  Marilyn. You're on the air. Go ahead, Mike.
[1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:21.000]  Yes, thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[1:48:21.000 --> 1:48:23.000]  I really appreciate you
[1:48:23.000 --> 1:48:25.000]  making me aware of the New World Order
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:27.000]  and what's going on.
[1:48:27.000 --> 1:48:29.000]  To harken back to what you said earlier
[1:48:29.000 --> 1:48:31.000]  about the media and stuff,
[1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:33.000]  corporate-controlled media,
[1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:35.000]  just as if we lived in the Soviet Union
[1:48:35.000 --> 1:48:37.000]  just like we're looking at Pronto.
[1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:39.000]  And the same thing also applies
[1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:41.000]  to the
[1:48:41.000 --> 1:48:43.000]  movie industry and everything else.
[1:48:43.000 --> 1:48:45.000]  And by the way, you should apply that to me.
[1:48:45.000 --> 1:48:47.000]  If I tell you a British military report
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:49.000]  and I tell you where the link is,
[1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:51.000]  says governments will use neutron weapons
[1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:53.000]  to stop citizens from overthrowing them,
[1:48:53.000 --> 1:48:55.000]  you better go read it.
[1:48:55.000 --> 1:48:57.000]  Yeah, I agree.
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:48:59.000]  Although the times that I doubted you
[1:48:59.000 --> 1:49:01.000]  when I've gone back to research
[1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:03.000]  that I've found that you've always been right.
[1:49:03.000 --> 1:49:05.000]  In my book, you've got a great track record.
[1:49:05.000 --> 1:49:07.000]  Still, don't trust me. Do not trust me.
[1:49:07.000 --> 1:49:09.000]  Yeah, what you're saying is right.
[1:49:09.000 --> 1:49:11.000]  And I just want to thank you for making me
[1:49:11.000 --> 1:49:13.000]  aware of like, I'm a movie buff
[1:49:13.000 --> 1:49:15.000]  and like movies like Fight Club
[1:49:15.000 --> 1:49:17.000]  where the last few minutes of the film
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:19.000]  you've got these high-rise buildings
[1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:21.000]  in Manhattan going down and stuff, things like that.
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:23.000]  Hey, remember the guy in
[1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:25.000]  2000 blowing up
[1:49:25.000 --> 1:49:27.000]  bombing
[1:49:27.000 --> 1:49:29.000]  mailboxes around the country?
[1:49:29.000 --> 1:49:31.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[1:49:31.000 --> 1:49:33.000]  And then I saw that it was
[1:49:33.000 --> 1:49:35.000]  a smiley face and I said
[1:49:35.000 --> 1:49:37.000]  it's a Fight Club fan.
[1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:39.000]  It's a Fight Club person.
[1:49:39.000 --> 1:49:41.000]  This is real terrorism,
[1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:43.000]  but it's low intensity for attention
[1:49:43.000 --> 1:49:45.000]  and that was about two weeks
[1:49:45.000 --> 1:49:47.000]  before the FBI caught him and it was Fight Club.
[1:49:47.000 --> 1:49:49.000]  But it's not that I'm a genius.
[1:49:49.000 --> 1:49:51.000]  The guy's bombing a smiley face.
[1:49:51.000 --> 1:49:53.000]  They bomb smiley faces in the movie.
[1:49:53.000 --> 1:49:55.000]  I said that woman
[1:49:55.000 --> 1:49:57.000]  that put the B on her face
[1:49:57.000 --> 1:49:59.000]  because it was backwards in the mirror.
[1:49:59.000 --> 1:50:01.000]  I said it was fake.
[1:50:01.000 --> 1:50:03.000]  I mean, I'm an investigator. That's what I do.
[1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:05.000]  I know who criminals are.
[1:50:05.000 --> 1:50:07.000]  I know what you are, you stinking government.
[1:50:07.000 --> 1:50:09.000]  You're a pack of crooks and pets.
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:11.000]  Oh, you make me sick. Go ahead.
[1:50:11.000 --> 1:50:13.000]  You're able to connect the dots
[1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:15.000]  because you live and breathe this,
[1:50:15.000 --> 1:50:17.000]  but I want to bring one movie to your attention
[1:50:17.000 --> 1:50:19.000]  and ask you if this is a predictive program
[1:50:19.000 --> 1:50:21.000]  and I don't know what is.
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:23.000]  Of course, I'm sure you know about
[1:50:23.000 --> 1:50:25.000]  men and how that precedes
[1:50:25.000 --> 1:50:27.000]  the government's running a program.
[1:50:27.000 --> 1:50:29.000]  80 plus percent sperm reduction
[1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:31.000]  in men, close to men and women
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:33.000]  with their eggs being infertile.
[1:50:33.000 --> 1:50:35.000]  They're frying us by design. It's all young.
[1:50:35.000 --> 1:50:37.000]  Well, there's a movie I saw the pre-use for
[1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:39.000]  a couple weeks ago and I
[1:50:39.000 --> 1:50:41.000]  have yet to see it at the local theaters
[1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:43.000]  and I don't know if the movie bombed
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:45.000]  because it was lousy or had critics,
[1:50:45.000 --> 1:50:47.000]  but it's called Blindness and this is
[1:50:47.000 --> 1:50:49.000]  a New World Order's dream. The premise of the movie
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:51.000]  is it stars Julianne Moore.
[1:50:51.000 --> 1:50:53.000]  It sounds like an interesting
[1:50:53.000 --> 1:50:55.000]  and maybe interesting. Well, what happens?
[1:50:55.000 --> 1:50:57.000]  I've got to move on.
[1:50:57.000 --> 1:50:59.000]  Basically, the premise of the movie is
[1:50:59.000 --> 1:51:01.000]  people are struck blind
[1:51:01.000 --> 1:51:03.000]  by this disease
[1:51:03.000 --> 1:51:05.000]  that spreads and only a few people
[1:51:05.000 --> 1:51:07.000]  are able to
[1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:09.000]  That's exactly the type of soft kill stuff
[1:51:09.000 --> 1:51:11.000]  that the United Nations
[1:51:11.000 --> 1:51:13.000]  eugenics directorate is doing
[1:51:13.000 --> 1:51:15.000]  in their own admissions.
[1:51:15.000 --> 1:51:17.000]  They already have vaccines
[1:51:17.000 --> 1:51:19.000]  that they can give you a shot.
[1:51:19.000 --> 1:51:21.000]  They call it a vaccine and the viruses
[1:51:21.000 --> 1:51:23.000]  then go attack the optic nerves.
[1:51:23.000 --> 1:51:25.000]  They can give you a shot
[1:51:25.000 --> 1:51:27.000]  that quote cures you from
[1:51:27.000 --> 1:51:29.000]  cocaine abuse or
[1:51:29.000 --> 1:51:31.000]  cigarettes, but it attacks
[1:51:31.000 --> 1:51:33.000]  the brain cells and the neuro-receptors.
[1:51:33.000 --> 1:51:35.000]  These are live acting
[1:51:35.000 --> 1:51:37.000]  viruses and so, yeah, they got
[1:51:37.000 --> 1:51:39.000]  a bunch of movies about that.
[1:51:39.000 --> 1:51:41.000]  Take
[1:51:41.000 --> 1:51:43.000]  the movie that came out
[1:51:43.000 --> 1:51:45.000]  I Am Legend and see
[1:51:45.000 --> 1:51:47.000]  that's where there's a cancer cure
[1:51:47.000 --> 1:51:49.000]  shot, but then it kills
[1:51:49.000 --> 1:51:51.000]  98% of the public or whatever.
[1:51:51.000 --> 1:51:53.000]  You see, folks, they have
[1:51:53.000 --> 1:51:55.000]  all of this, okay?
[1:51:55.000 --> 1:51:57.000]  Minus the zombies. Let's go ahead
[1:51:57.000 --> 1:51:59.000]  and talk to Teresa. You're on the area.
[1:51:59.000 --> 1:52:01.000]  Psychopathic new world order people are in control, folks.
[1:52:01.000 --> 1:52:03.000]  We're only going to stop them by waking up.
[1:52:03.000 --> 1:52:05.000]  You're on the air.
[1:52:05.000 --> 1:52:07.000]  Welcome, Teresa. North Dakota.
[1:52:07.000 --> 1:52:09.000]  Well, thank you. I won't let you know that we appreciate
[1:52:09.000 --> 1:52:11.000]  everything you do and
[1:52:11.000 --> 1:52:13.000]  we live in a small community
[1:52:13.000 --> 1:52:15.000]  of about 3,000 people
[1:52:15.000 --> 1:52:17.000]  and they want to take
[1:52:17.000 --> 1:52:19.000]  $5.5 million to fix
[1:52:19.000 --> 1:52:21.000]  our roads.
[1:52:21.000 --> 1:52:23.000]  Well, what they want to do is they want to slap
[1:52:23.000 --> 1:52:25.000]  a 15-year assessment for every
[1:52:25.000 --> 1:52:27.000]  homeowner, okay?
[1:52:27.000 --> 1:52:29.000]  Yeah, and they're going to take that money and invest it
[1:52:29.000 --> 1:52:31.000]  and foreign banks are going to steal it.
[1:52:31.000 --> 1:52:33.000]  Wait until the whole government collapses.
[1:52:33.000 --> 1:52:35.000]  They're going to have SWAT teams stealing your house. Go ahead.
[1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:37.000]  Right, and the road is only in the last 10 years.
[1:52:37.000 --> 1:52:39.000]  Okay, but they want to do a 15-year
[1:52:39.000 --> 1:52:41.000]  assessment.
[1:52:41.000 --> 1:52:43.000]  And so, what they want to do
[1:52:43.000 --> 1:52:45.000]  is
[1:52:45.000 --> 1:52:47.000]  so we could protest this if we wanted to
[1:52:47.000 --> 1:52:49.000]  and we had to have 50% of the
[1:52:49.000 --> 1:52:51.000]  people in our town protest.
[1:52:51.000 --> 1:52:53.000]  You know, fill out the forms and
[1:52:53.000 --> 1:52:55.000]  but you had to have your legal house description
[1:52:55.000 --> 1:52:57.000]  on there. Well, not everybody knows
[1:52:57.000 --> 1:52:59.000]  their legal house description.
[1:52:59.000 --> 1:53:01.000]  And if you didn't have that, they'd throw your protest out.
[1:53:01.000 --> 1:53:03.000]  Well, what they do is the property tax
[1:53:03.000 --> 1:53:05.000]  raping us isn't enough
[1:53:05.000 --> 1:53:07.000]  and so they need more money
[1:53:07.000 --> 1:53:09.000]  to pay their husbands and wives and the nepotism
[1:53:09.000 --> 1:53:11.000]  and the corruption and the boss hogs.
[1:53:11.000 --> 1:53:13.000]  They come in and say, we're putting curbs in.
[1:53:13.000 --> 1:53:15.000]  You owe us 20 grand.
[1:53:15.000 --> 1:53:17.000]  Right, but we'll get there. And if you don't
[1:53:17.000 --> 1:53:19.000]  leave your house, the SWAT team will drop by.
[1:53:19.000 --> 1:53:21.000]  40 to 45%
[1:53:21.000 --> 1:53:23.000]  of the property in this town
[1:53:23.000 --> 1:53:25.000]  is owned by the city already.
[1:53:25.000 --> 1:53:27.000]  I know. That's how America works.
[1:53:27.000 --> 1:53:29.000]  To get 50% of the protest, it'd be literally impossible.
[1:53:29.000 --> 1:53:31.000]  Look, they're saying
[1:53:31.000 --> 1:53:33.000]  everybody they put out of work is going to get
[1:53:33.000 --> 1:53:35.000]  a green police job.
[1:53:35.000 --> 1:53:37.000]  Obama's website said everybody freaked out
[1:53:37.000 --> 1:53:39.000]  so they took it down, but then I saw Kennedy
[1:53:39.000 --> 1:53:41.000]  on TV today pushing it.
[1:53:41.000 --> 1:53:43.000]  Not the one dying of the cellphone tumor,
[1:53:43.000 --> 1:53:45.000]  the other one.
[1:53:45.000 --> 1:53:47.000]  And if they put this assessment on there,
[1:53:47.000 --> 1:53:49.000]  nobody's going to be able to sell their house.
[1:53:49.000 --> 1:53:51.000]  That's what it's all about.
[1:53:51.000 --> 1:53:53.000]  And if you can't pay the assessment,
[1:53:53.000 --> 1:53:55.000]  it's going to be a property grant.
[1:53:55.000 --> 1:53:57.000]  They want to bankrupt us.
[1:53:57.000 --> 1:53:59.000]  Banks want to bankrupt.
[1:53:59.000 --> 1:54:01.000]  The big elite banks, not your local ones,
[1:54:01.000 --> 1:54:03.000]  they want business. They want good economies.
[1:54:03.000 --> 1:54:05.000]  Local banks are good. And by the way,
[1:54:05.000 --> 1:54:07.000]  they're using the bailout money to buy up
[1:54:07.000 --> 1:54:09.000]  and to shake your call.
[1:54:09.000 --> 1:54:11.000]  Look, government is now
[1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:13.000]  a private receivership arm to steal stuff
[1:54:13.000 --> 1:54:15.000]  to give it to foreign banks.
[1:54:15.000 --> 1:54:17.000]  That's what the New World Order is.
[1:54:17.000 --> 1:54:19.000]  That's what this big global meeting was.
[1:54:19.000 --> 1:54:21.000]  Michael in Kansas City, you're on the air.
[1:54:21.000 --> 1:54:23.000]  Thanks for holding.
[1:54:23.000 --> 1:54:25.000]  Hello, Alex.
[1:54:25.000 --> 1:54:27.000]  First off, I want to thank you from the bottom
[1:54:27.000 --> 1:54:29.000]  of my heart for trying to inform everybody
[1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:31.000]  about what's going on.
[1:54:31.000 --> 1:54:33.000]  That's what I'm trying to do here in Kansas City.
[1:54:33.000 --> 1:54:35.000]  It was obvious to me from the beginning
[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:37.000]  that those World Trade Centers
[1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:39.000]  were blown to bits.
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:41.000]  And I'm really happy to see so many people
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:43.000]  are becoming informed.
[1:54:43.000 --> 1:54:45.000]  Hold on a minute. The government declassified
[1:54:45.000 --> 1:54:47.000]  that they radiated 4,000 plus
[1:54:47.000 --> 1:54:49.000]  foster children to death and radiation tests.
[1:54:49.000 --> 1:54:51.000]  But the government wouldn't kill people
[1:54:51.000 --> 1:54:53.000]  in buildings. The government's nice.
[1:54:53.000 --> 1:54:55.000]  Go ahead.
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:54:57.000]  I carry it. I carry it.
[1:54:57.000 --> 1:54:59.000]  I'm giving away 300 or 400 copies
[1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:01.000]  of loose change since this came out.
[1:55:01.000 --> 1:55:03.000]  I give it away to total strangers.
[1:55:03.000 --> 1:55:05.000]  And the majority of people think I'm nuts
[1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:07.000]  or some kind of communist.
[1:55:07.000 --> 1:55:09.000]  Polls don't show that.
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:11.000]  Polls show the majority believe you.
[1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:13.000]  You ought to give them end game.
[1:55:13.000 --> 1:55:15.000]  I'm so glad to see so many people
[1:55:15.000 --> 1:55:17.000]  becoming aware of it, like this
[1:55:17.000 --> 1:55:19.000]  Architects and Engineers 9-11 Truth
[1:55:19.000 --> 1:55:21.000]  Organization has come out.
[1:55:21.000 --> 1:55:23.000]  We've got some,
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:25.000]  what the mainstream would call
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:27.000]  reputable people.
[1:55:27.000 --> 1:55:29.000]  I got National Geographic coming in this week
[1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:31.000]  and they said, you will not discuss
[1:55:31.000 --> 1:55:33.000]  and I just said fine, I'll even do a rigged
[1:55:33.000 --> 1:55:35.000]  hit piece. I'll even go in.
[1:55:35.000 --> 1:55:37.000]  They got gloves with huge pieces of iron
[1:55:37.000 --> 1:55:39.000]  on the front and my hands are tied behind
[1:55:39.000 --> 1:55:41.000]  my back in the fight.
[1:55:41.000 --> 1:55:43.000]  They got hatchets and my arms are tied behind
[1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:45.000]  my back. They said, you can't talk about
[1:55:45.000 --> 1:55:47.000]  Northwoods, you can't talk about Gulf of Tonkin,
[1:55:47.000 --> 1:55:49.000]  you can't talk about the history of
[1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:51.000]  government sponsored terrorism, you can't
[1:55:51.000 --> 1:55:53.000]  talk about the drills that day.
[1:55:53.000 --> 1:55:55.000]  It's all limited to their little
[1:55:55.000 --> 1:55:57.000]  rig deal.
[1:55:57.000 --> 1:55:59.000]  My question to you is
[1:55:59.000 --> 1:56:01.000]  ever since we went off
[1:56:01.000 --> 1:56:03.000]  the gold standard and our money is
[1:56:03.000 --> 1:56:05.000]  backed on debt, right?
[1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:07.000]  They keep running up to
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:09.000]  debt and I've been looking at these figures
[1:56:09.000 --> 1:56:11.000]  and we're on an exponential curve and I
[1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:13.000]  knew that this
[1:56:13.000 --> 1:56:15.000]  financial disaster was going to happen.
[1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:17.000]  I see
[1:56:17.000 --> 1:56:19.000]  how they're manipulating the money.
[1:56:19.000 --> 1:56:21.000]  My main question to you right now
[1:56:21.000 --> 1:56:23.000]  is it seems like 9-11 is a mood
[1:56:23.000 --> 1:56:25.000]  thing right now.
[1:56:25.000 --> 1:56:27.000]  No it's not. I appreciate your call.
[1:56:27.000 --> 1:56:29.000]  I've got to let you go. It shows over.
[1:56:29.000 --> 1:56:31.000]  I'm going to answer the question and I'm sorry
[1:56:31.000 --> 1:56:33.000]  to everybody else because I've got to
[1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:35.000]  go. Stephen Maine and
[1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:37.000]  Chris at Florida, Jim, everybody call me
[1:56:37.000 --> 1:56:39.000]  to go to the headline.
[1:56:39.000 --> 1:56:41.000]  Here's the deal.
[1:56:41.000 --> 1:56:43.000]  9-11,
[1:56:43.000 --> 1:56:45.000]  because people think Bush did it, he's a
[1:56:45.000 --> 1:56:47.000]  puppet. The government, the military
[1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:49.000]  industrial complex, the bankers carried out
[1:56:49.000 --> 1:56:51.000]  the attacks. It was in their own documents
[1:56:51.000 --> 1:56:53.000]  that they needed stage terror attacks to
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:55.000]  get us to accept the police state
[1:56:55.000 --> 1:56:57.000]  so they could steal our pension funds.
[1:56:57.000 --> 1:56:59.000]  They had to put a police state in so they said
[1:56:59.000 --> 1:57:01.000]  it's to fight al-Qaeda. Now they admit it's for
[1:57:01.000 --> 1:57:03.000]  us.
[1:57:03.000 --> 1:57:05.000]  It's more important than ever because they're
[1:57:05.000 --> 1:57:07.000]  now saying there's going to be stage terror
[1:57:07.000 --> 1:57:09.000]  under Obama. The CIA is saying get ready,
[1:57:09.000 --> 1:57:11.000]  they're about to head us again to test him
[1:57:11.000 --> 1:57:13.000]  so he can take all our rights and
[1:57:13.000 --> 1:57:15.000]  support torture and more wars.
[1:57:15.000 --> 1:57:17.000]  So exposing government-sponsored terror
[1:57:17.000 --> 1:57:19.000]  and the hundreds of times they admit
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:21.000]  they've done it. That's right.
[1:57:21.000 --> 1:57:23.000]  Declassified is absolutely essential.
[1:57:23.000 --> 1:57:25.000]  Thank you all. I want to take more of your calls
