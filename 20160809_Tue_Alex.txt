[00:00.000 --> 00:16.680]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God, it's Alex Jones.
[00:30.000 --> 00:45.200]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, everybody knows I don't engage in political hype or disinformation.
[00:45.200 --> 00:51.960]  I don't push narratives because I hope people will pick up on them.
[00:51.960 --> 00:59.960]  I push narratives when I know the truth and when I know the globalists are scared of them.
[00:59.960 --> 01:03.680]  Let's let Dave Mustaine continue on for a moment.
[01:03.680 --> 01:08.680]  In my hour of need, no, you are not fit.
[01:08.680 --> 01:24.160]  And though I reach down for you, Hillary, like a Greek, tragedy, is stumbling, dying towards the great org of power.
[01:24.160 --> 01:29.360]  She's always lost to that because she was a teenager recruited by the CIA.
[01:29.360 --> 01:47.880]  And the Ford Foundation, then by MI6, you're not going to get it, lady, and all your evil minions.
[01:47.880 --> 02:05.280]  And even if you steal the president, even if you attain the Oval Office, you will help bring down the New World Order magnificently.
[02:05.280 --> 02:24.640]  Yeah, you think it's our darkest hour as you prepare to bring down the Republic? As you prepare to finally decapitate the United States of America as you drug us to the mud and use us to carry out all your evil?
[02:24.640 --> 02:41.440]  There are more videos surfacing on a daily basis of her disintegration. They're running around with the tranquilizer pen to stop her from having her seizures.
[02:41.440 --> 02:57.440]  And every day she looks like she's deteriorating faster as God steps in, like plagues visited upon Egypt and finally upon Pharaoh's house.
[02:57.440 --> 03:19.320]  You will only see it intensify, ladies and gentlemen, because this country has had Providence on its side, always has. This is a foreign globalist takeover. And there are still people that love God and love the Republic and love the great experiment that is this system.
[03:19.320 --> 03:31.560]  And so as I say every day, it was the best of times, the worst of times. We have a dichotomy in front of us in our hands.
[03:31.560 --> 03:56.680]  We have a parallel system. We are at that proverbial crossroads right now. And the rigging of Donald Trump's speeches where they cut live feeds when he talks about Hillary being a communist Chinese agent, or he talks about Hillary being the founder of ISIS, which is a term I coined.
[03:56.680 --> 04:07.480]  I'm quite proud of that, which she is. I wouldn't call her the founder of ISIS if she wasn't the founder of ISIS. Look it up for yourself.
[04:07.480 --> 04:21.240]  And so now we have more videos of her on the podium at the stage, suddenly not knowing what planet she's on.
[04:21.240 --> 04:37.320]  Talk about judgment. But before we celebrate too much, I don't normally celebrate people's ailments, but it's like God, you know, cursing Herod or something for the things he's done.
[04:37.320 --> 04:52.400]  I just don't want this great evil to be in full control of the nation. But at the same time, imagine her in the Oval Office as she degenerates and rots in front of everyone what she'll pull and what our handlers will pull.
[04:52.400 --> 05:00.000]  I mean, this is a very satanic move by the elite to put this witch in power. We'll be back.
[05:00.000 --> 05:11.880]  Joe Bates here with infowars.com. Communist Party unites behind Hillary. The Communist Party USA may not control many actual votes, but what they lack in support is made up for an enthusiasm.
[05:11.880 --> 05:25.640]  A passion was in full display with a seven person team of reporters covering their national political convention last month, and their convention was a democratic national convention that nominated Hillary Clinton as their undisputed candidate for president.
[05:25.640 --> 05:36.200]  Here are some examples from the editorial produced as part of that coverage by the team. Donald Trump steals wages. He'd pick your pocket in New York minute. He lies and spreads hate. He's a racist in a bully.
[05:36.200 --> 05:56.600]  Do not underestimate Trump and the Republicans while the establishment GOP was surprised by the successful insurgency of so-called outsider Trump. They are united in purpose, delivering more inequality, more misery, more instability and violence against working class people of all races, genders, religions and sexual orientations. The party also gave a big thumbs up to Clinton's running mate, Tim Cain.

[06:59.000 --> 07:04.000]  Dr. Group, you developed Living Defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why is this so good?
[07:04.000 --> 07:15.000]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most. I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system.
[07:15.000 --> 07:27.000]  But right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease around.
[07:27.000 --> 07:31.000]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites.
[07:31.000 --> 07:34.000]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[07:34.000 --> 07:41.000]  You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[07:41.000 --> 07:47.000]  All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today. It just came back in yesterday. Living Defense, infowarslife.com.
[07:47.000 --> 07:54.000]  And folks, you can't lose. It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period. And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[07:54.000 --> 08:02.000]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center. Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[08:02.000 --> 08:12.000]  You have the power. Humanity has the power. We have the power. Do you want to fight? You better believe you got one!
[08:12.000 --> 08:36.000]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty. It's Alex Jones.
[08:36.000 --> 08:56.000]  It is Tuesday, the ninth day of August, 2000 and 16. We're only 91 days out right now from the 2016 presidential election that is undoubtedly the most important election in this nation's history.
[08:56.000 --> 09:10.000]  Hands down, it's not debatable. Whether you're talking about total control of the Supreme Court or whether you're talking about the future of our borders themselves,
[09:10.000 --> 09:19.000]  or the fact that we're going under international, multinational, unelected trade boards established by private corporations.
[09:19.000 --> 09:32.000]  The all-out attack on language, the all-out attack on the family, the all-out attack on normal human activity and agrarian farming activities.
[09:32.000 --> 09:40.000]  Look at DrudgeReport.com. It says it all. This morning, I was doing research for the show and I said to myself,
[09:40.000 --> 09:49.000]  when I get in today, I've got to have them make a bunch of liners that have Twilight Zone music. I mean, we already have that, but I want liners.
[09:49.000 --> 09:57.000]  In fact, I even started telling them to bring this last night, but I definitely want it now that just has the countdown every day.
[09:57.000 --> 10:05.000]  91 days, 90 days with Twilight Zone music playing in the background, because it's the only way to describe it. That's what this is.
[10:05.000 --> 10:12.000]  Every day, it becomes more Twilight Zone. And then I go to DrudgeReport.com.
[10:12.000 --> 10:31.000]  Twilight Zone, Orlando, terrorist dad for Clinton, cheers Hillary at rally, said God will punish gays supported Taliban.
[10:31.000 --> 10:42.000]  Now, this isn't his dad saying this 20, 30 years ago in Afghanistan. This is his dad has a YouTube show in Arabic and Pashtun.
[10:42.000 --> 10:51.000]  And his son went to the mosque where they preached on video. We have the clips in English because we love the homosexuals.
[10:51.000 --> 11:01.000]  We kill them. It is the humane thing to do for Allah. Some weird creepoid imam.
[11:01.000 --> 11:08.000]  And then they invert reality and blame Donald Trump. I mean, it's all Twilight Zone.
[11:08.000 --> 11:15.000]  Because that's what it is.
[11:15.000 --> 11:37.000]  And his dad is at the rally with this big yellow sign praising Hillary. Twilight Zone, Orlando, terrorist dad for Clinton, cheers Hillary at rally, said God will punish gays supported Taliban.
[11:37.000 --> 11:46.000]  And he's there on the local news on local NBC. Hillary Clinton makes the biggest investments since World War II. Good financial security.
[11:46.000 --> 11:53.000]  XCIA Chief Morrell, Hillary told the truth about Benghazi, gun control laws.
[11:53.000 --> 12:11.000]  Here's this guy with his whole family running refugee programs. The father-in-law of the shooter. Remember the Pulse nightclub? 50 something dead.
[12:11.000 --> 12:37.000]  And then you never even hear apologies out of this guy's mouth. And then he's in an Orlando suburb at a Hillary rally. But wait, it gets worse. Infowars.com shows video of Hillary with only 171 people turning up for her rally in Florida.
[12:37.000 --> 12:49.000]  In an empty aircraft hangar, but the press crops the photos to make it look like she has a giant audience.
[12:49.000 --> 12:58.000]  Media Photoshop's Hillary crowd to make her audience look bigger. Only 171 people turn up for Clinton's rally in Florida. They crop it.
[12:58.000 --> 13:12.000]  And in the crowd behind her is Sadiq Mateen, father of Omar Mateen, the Pulse nightclub mass murderer who has nothing to do with Islam.
[13:12.000 --> 13:31.000]  Oh, look, Al Qaeda just hit again. Oh, look, ISIS just hit again yesterday. Hundreds killed and different suicide bombings in the Middle East and Central Asia. And it's like, oh, ISIS hits again? That's the group that has nothing to do with Islam.
[13:31.000 --> 13:36.000]  Here is the shooter's father talking about how wonderful Hillary is.
[13:36.000 --> 13:47.000]  Hillary Clinton speaking to a crowd in Kissimmee just south of Orlando, supposed to be talking jobs, but started off paying tribute to those affected by the Pulse nightclub shooting.
[13:47.000 --> 13:53.000]  And I know how many people, family members, loved ones and friends are still grieving.
[13:53.000 --> 14:02.000]  Notice the man right behind Secretary Clinton with the mustache and wearing a red hat. That's the father of the Orlando shooter.
[14:02.000 --> 14:08.000]  Just hours later, by chance, we ran into him at a rest stop on the way back to West Palm Beach.
[14:08.000 --> 14:12.000]  Clinton is good for United States versus Donald Trump.
[14:12.000 --> 14:17.000]  He wanted to do an interview and showed us a sign he made for Hillary Clinton.
[14:17.000 --> 14:20.000]  So tell us why you wanted to stop and talk now.
[14:20.000 --> 14:35.000]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Why does Drudge call this Twilight Zone? Why was I yesterday telling crew I want Twilight Zone intros and outros for the election?
[14:35.000 --> 14:49.000]  And I want to be able to tailor them every day that has new weirdness that's going on, new bizarreness, and then finally have a big compendium one that's like 10 minutes long right before the election of just all the insanity on day 91.
[14:49.000 --> 14:56.000]  This happened. On day 90, this happened. On day 99, this happened.
[14:56.000 --> 15:12.000]  On day 91, the Orlando mass murder Islamist's dad shows up for Clinton and only gets weirder from there.
[15:12.000 --> 15:36.000]  Just like Khan, oh, the poor person whose son died in Iraq, who set up a Sharia law law journal and law center to integrate Sharia law, specifically as its founding mission.
[15:36.000 --> 15:46.000]  Over Western jurisprudence, which is a merger of European and Anglo-Saxon common law and Jewish law. That's what it is.
[15:46.000 --> 15:51.000]  And the two are so close. That's why they integrated so well. Not the same as Islamic law.
[15:51.000 --> 15:59.000]  And what we're sitting here looking at is total crazy land.
[15:59.000 --> 16:10.000]  I mean, we are overrun. I used to hear 10 years ago by people, they're putting Islamists instead of the FBI and CIA and NSA and the military, and they're going to be putting them in as police chiefs all over Europe, and they're going to take over with them.
[16:10.000 --> 16:17.000]  I'm like, oh, shut up. I know there's a lot of radical Muslims and bad stuff over there, but we shouldn't be stirring them up and we shouldn't be over there.
[16:17.000 --> 16:21.000]  And, you know, this is all exaggerated to take our rights away.
[16:21.000 --> 16:33.000]  I didn't know that they were actually setting them up to basically take over and be the enforcers and henchmen because they'll just go blow themselves up or kill themselves for the establishment anytime they're given an order to do it.
[16:33.000 --> 16:39.000]  The liberals have finally found their army.
[16:39.000 --> 17:02.000]  And of course, they're not liberals. And then indicative emblematic, archetypal, illustrative, declarative, underlining, emblazoning, spotlighting.
[17:02.000 --> 17:13.000]  The rotting establishment is Hillary in Bozo land. There's a new video we're going to have for the break of her on the campaign trail, just totally forgetting who she is.
[17:13.000 --> 17:23.000]  And just just like my grandmother, who's 91 until about a year ago was always there. Sometimes you'll be a go visitor and she'll just suddenly for about a minute not know who she is.
[17:23.000 --> 17:25.000]  And then suddenly she's right back.
[17:25.000 --> 17:34.000]  Hillary Clinton is now doing this on TV everywhere she goes and stumbling around and looks like a bag lady.
[17:34.000 --> 17:45.000]  She doesn't just look old. I wouldn't care if she was 70 years old and knew what she was doing. 80 years old. It's that she is doddering.
[17:45.000 --> 17:58.000]  Phyllis Schlafly at what 90 years old is more together than Hillary Clinton. When you see her give a speech, her body's frail, but her brain is still 95% there.
[17:58.000 --> 18:05.000]  Compared to the incredible intellect she was, she's now just an intellect, a strong intellect. Hillary is gone.
[18:05.000 --> 18:16.000]  Ain't there, ladies and gentlemen, whacked out of her brain. And you can tell she's on drugs. Speed, you name it. That's why she can get charged up and just be all angry.
[18:16.000 --> 18:22.000]  That's why she can't have press conferences. This is why she's like, I'm sorry, I got short-circuited. Oh, Benghazi.
[18:22.000 --> 18:34.000]  I mean, her first press conference in a year. And then you've got this guy who doesn't even have any shame. Here's the big issue.
[18:34.000 --> 18:45.000]  Omar Matinth Jaddy Sadiq, the famous Taliban jihadi brought over here by the CIA in the late 1980s.
[18:45.000 --> 18:58.000]  He's driving around his Mercedes, his modern Mercedes, getting out of his $85,000 car to hold up his Hillary sign. What on earth is going on here?
[18:58.000 --> 19:10.000]  Orlando terrorist father cheers at Hillary Clinton rally, calls for gun control, when his son had a Homeland Security clearance in legal guns.
[19:10.000 --> 19:24.000]  I mean, under his system, under his beliefs, I'm skipping the break. Under all of that network break, I can do it.
[19:24.000 --> 19:33.000]  In fact, I'm going to be honest. Before I punched up Drudge and saw that, I was going to come on air and say, I almost can't even do this show anymore.
[19:33.000 --> 19:43.000]  I'm going to skip this break, guys. We'll go out of the next segment with Twilight Zone.
[19:43.000 --> 20:02.000]  Because it's getting so crazy that it's almost like even sitting up here on air and laughing at all this and playing videos and saying what's coming next almost turns us into sick spectators who are tied down watching little demons eat our toes off.
[20:02.000 --> 20:09.000]  And we're like, look at that little demon. He just ate my big toe and now he's chewing at my heel. Oh, look, I'm bleeding all over the table.
[20:09.000 --> 20:15.000]  Another one just climbed up and I'm chained down and oh, look, they're fighting with each other. Look how evil they are. Doesn't matter.
[20:15.000 --> 20:28.000]  We're chained down with them eating our feet. Now they're metaphorically climbing up with sewing needles and jamming them in our eyes.
[20:28.000 --> 20:36.000]  And we're like, look at this country. It'll never wake up when we're all the body politic being attacked, being diseased, being overrun.
[20:36.000 --> 20:50.000]  Do you know how over the top it is to bring in millions of people a year over the southern border alone that have diseases like TB and black plague and leprosy, which have now made comebacks.
[20:50.000 --> 21:02.000]  They were eradicated. Black plague, bubonic plague, wet leprosy. It's now they're having to set up leper colonies in Texas and Florida.
[21:02.000 --> 21:13.000]  And the CDC tries to keep them quiet, but they're there. Leper colonies, boys and girls, they'll let people in.
[21:13.000 --> 21:18.000]  And there's the board patrol, their gloves and their masks, because I've talked to them and this is listed in literature.
[21:18.000 --> 21:29.000]  They're like, oh, this guy's got wet leprosy, nose rotting off. They don't give them medical treatment. They let them in.
[21:29.000 --> 21:33.000]  But forget leprosy. That's still rare.
[21:33.000 --> 21:48.000]  Drug resistant TB, where the antibiotics that might be able to control it, not get rid of it, cause liver failure and kidney failure in most people within two or three uses.
[21:48.000 --> 21:59.000]  They're taking them and putting them in high schools and middle schools and elementary schools and colleges all over the country and not even testing them.
[21:59.000 --> 22:09.000]  Oh, but don't worry. The high schools and colleges want to make you take 50 something vaccines, including meningitis vaccines that have been linked to all sorts of medical problems.
[22:09.000 --> 22:16.000]  That's okay. And upwards of 22% of the refugees have TB now. That's associated for us.
[22:16.000 --> 22:26.000]  And they don't even test them. That'd be culturally rude. Cause then what we do with you? No, come here, Akeem Ali.
[22:26.000 --> 22:36.000]  Whatever their name is, come here and sit right down next to little Jenny.
[22:36.000 --> 22:42.000]  Why? Why? Why?
[22:42.000 --> 22:51.000]  Because they're at war with us, ladies and gentlemen. The globalist are bringing down the West as we speak.
[22:51.000 --> 22:59.000]  The bare minimum is you would give treatment to these poor souls, like they did at Ellis Island. Statue of Liberty.
[22:59.000 --> 23:06.000]  Oh, you got to come in, but you got cured of your disease first or shipped back.
[23:06.000 --> 23:18.000]  You're tired. You're hungry. You're diseased. So this is the arrogance. Let's back that local NBC newscast up.
[23:18.000 --> 23:25.000]  At least they saw the horror and the bizarreness of it. National media is like, well, see, he cares. He wants gun control.
[23:25.000 --> 23:35.000]  He's sorry for what his son did. No, he's not. He's there as a jihadi who has his own YouTube show who pushes Sharia law
[23:35.000 --> 23:42.000]  and everything that the Imam that his son followed was saying. And it's outrageous that the media never made an issue of his dad.
[23:42.000 --> 23:50.000]  And why hasn't he been deported? Deport his Taliban butt. Oh no, that would be mean.
[23:50.000 --> 23:57.000]  So now he's so arrogant. And on such a power trip, cause you know, Trump's 15 points behind now.
[23:57.000 --> 24:02.000]  Why not make it 20 if we put the graph back there? Why not say he's 3,000 points behind?
[24:02.000 --> 24:06.000]  There could be 100 points behind. Folks would know that was impossible, though.
[24:06.000 --> 24:13.000]  So they're going to tell you, oh, Trump's 15 points, 12 points. Why Fox News has had the little coup now.
[24:13.000 --> 24:19.000]  Where they got rid of Roger Ailes. So I'm going to have scientific polls there. They have their new news director on this morning.
[24:19.000 --> 24:28.000]  And he was saying, oh, yes, there's a lot of fake polls that show Trump neck and neck, but the real polls show her about 12 points ahead.
[24:28.000 --> 24:33.000]  And that's where she's going to win. So Trump is going to lose.
[24:33.000 --> 24:39.000]  And Hammer and the other anchor were like, okay, well, thank you for that information.
[24:39.000 --> 24:44.000]  So we put up our new poll here. This is the new Hillary Clinton poll, MSNBC poll.
[24:44.000 --> 24:48.000]  Another new poll shows that she was 10 points ahead.
[24:48.000 --> 24:51.000]  Then she was, let me look at it here.
[24:51.000 --> 25:05.000]  347 points, 800 and something points, 1,465 points, then 2,727 points, and then 3,435 points is where she is today.
[25:05.000 --> 25:13.000]  On the 9th of August, 2016, she is 3,435 points ahead.
[25:13.000 --> 25:16.000]  And it's scientific. I said so. Okay.
[25:16.000 --> 25:23.000]  So she had 20,000 people in Orlando. That's what the news has been reporting.
[25:23.000 --> 25:28.000]  Now, I'm going to show you the reality here. It's on infowars.com.
[25:28.000 --> 25:33.000]  It's still linked on Drudge. I saw it on Drudge this morning as well. Folks can go there and see it.
[25:33.000 --> 25:38.000]  And if you're a radio listeners, you should go see this and you should send this on to folks.
[25:38.000 --> 25:43.000]  Media Photoshop's Hillary crowd to make her audience look bigger.
[25:43.000 --> 25:48.000]  They cropped it in and then also added and repeated some of the people in there.
[25:48.000 --> 25:51.000]  And why not? I mean, they're fighting an evil racist.
[25:51.000 --> 25:55.000]  So it's okay. Why not just beef that crowd up, crop it and beef it?
[25:55.000 --> 25:59.000]  In reality, look at that. No one. No one.
[25:59.000 --> 26:02.000]  In fact, they're saying that's 100 and 50 something.
[26:02.000 --> 26:06.000]  171. That isn't even that.
[26:06.000 --> 26:10.000]  Good Lord.
[26:10.000 --> 26:14.000]  This is what she has all over the country where Sanders would have 5,000, 20,000, 30,000.
[26:14.000 --> 26:17.000]  She would have a thousand Macs.
[26:17.000 --> 26:20.000]  We've been at the rallies where she'd have a thousand people.
[26:20.000 --> 26:23.000]  It'd be on the news. More than 20,000 showed up in Tennessee. Hillary.
[26:23.000 --> 26:26.000]  This is total state-run media.
[26:26.000 --> 26:29.000]  And it makes my head spin.
[26:29.000 --> 26:33.000]  Let's go back to Omar Mateen, killed 50-plus people.
[26:33.000 --> 26:36.000]  Here's his daddy, Sadiq.
[26:36.000 --> 26:41.000]  Just hours later, by chance, we ran into him at a rest stop on the way back to West Palm Beach.
[26:41.000 --> 26:46.000]  Clinton is good for United States versus Donald Trump.
[26:46.000 --> 26:51.000]  He wanted to do an interview and showed us a sign he made for Hillary Clinton.
[26:51.000 --> 26:54.000]  So tell us why you wanted to stop and talk now.
[26:54.000 --> 26:57.000]  Well, I feel like...
[26:57.000 --> 27:03.000]  I cannot believe he has the nerve again to go to a rally where she's invoking the dead, ignoring Islam's involvement.
[27:03.000 --> 27:08.000]  And then he has the nerve to blame our Second Amendment, our birthright.
[27:08.000 --> 27:11.000]  Because he wants his quarry disarmed.
[27:11.000 --> 27:14.000]  He wants his dimmy. That's when the Muslims start taking over.
[27:14.000 --> 27:18.000]  The subgroups have to pay tribute, and that's what we become.
[27:18.000 --> 27:23.000]  Meanwhile, at the Olympics, we get to see the Brazilian volleyball team.
[27:23.000 --> 27:25.000]  Oh, my God, those women are just...
[27:25.000 --> 27:27.000]  I think Brazilian women, maybe Eastern European.
[27:27.000 --> 27:30.000]  I don't know, but they're hot.
[27:30.000 --> 27:35.000]  Mexican TV stars, I mean, I'm just appreciating God's creations.
[27:35.000 --> 27:36.000]  Can't we all?
[27:36.000 --> 27:43.000]  You've got juxtaposed the Egyptian women totally covered up in teletubbie uniforms.
[27:43.000 --> 27:45.000]  Just like in Europe, they're banning water parks.
[27:45.000 --> 27:47.000]  You know, wearing bikinis, you're going to wear burk outfits.
[27:47.000 --> 27:49.000]  That's actually happening.
[27:49.000 --> 27:53.000]  And we've got the German team.
[27:53.000 --> 27:55.000]  It looks really good too.
[27:55.000 --> 27:57.000]  The Brazilian team, that's what I like.
[27:57.000 --> 27:59.000]  It's athletic, God's creations.
[27:59.000 --> 28:00.000]  That's the way to go.
[28:00.000 --> 28:04.000]  And then you've got the poor Muslim women in their hooded outfits.
[28:04.000 --> 28:06.000]  I mean, I really feel sorry for them.
[28:06.000 --> 28:08.000]  I really, really do.
[28:08.000 --> 28:13.000]  But the particular one of them with the Brazilian team, it's something else.
[28:13.000 --> 28:16.000]  I mean, look at those goddesses, God's creation.
[28:16.000 --> 28:19.000]  And then you've got next to them these poor women having to cover themselves up.
[28:19.000 --> 28:24.000]  I'm going to stop right there, please.
[28:24.000 --> 28:30.000]  Let's go back to Mr. Taliban, who has his own YouTube channel, his own YouTube show,
[28:30.000 --> 28:32.000]  agreeing with everything, basically his son pushed.
[28:32.000 --> 28:33.000]  Here it is.
[28:33.000 --> 28:35.000]  Why stop, talk to you?
[28:35.000 --> 28:40.000]  Because it's very important for the United States of America, especially the election.
[28:40.000 --> 28:43.000]  I was invited by the Democratic Party.
[28:43.000 --> 28:50.000]  Just like come support Hillary, just a regular chain email or a personal invitation?
[28:50.000 --> 28:53.000]  So it came out, I'm a member.
[28:53.000 --> 28:57.000]  So as a member, I get the invitation, but it's not that particular about it.
[28:57.000 --> 29:02.000]  What went into your decision about going to this event, right here in Orlando,
[29:02.000 --> 29:06.000]  where this Pulse nightclub shooting happened?
[29:06.000 --> 29:09.000]  I wish, because I spoke a lot about that.
[29:09.000 --> 29:18.000]  And I wish that my son joined the army and fought ISIS and destroyed ISIS.
[29:18.000 --> 29:20.000]  That would be much better.
[29:20.000 --> 29:26.000]  Did Hillary Clinton's campaign know that you were going to that event and sitting right directly behind her?
[29:26.000 --> 29:31.000]  It's a Democratic Party, so everybody can join.
[29:31.000 --> 29:38.000]  Do you think that some people will be surprised to know that you were there in Orlando or near Orlando?
[29:38.000 --> 29:41.000]  Why they should be surprised?
[29:41.000 --> 29:42.000]  We'll be back.
[29:42.000 --> 29:43.000]  We'll be back.
[29:43.000 --> 29:44.000]  I can't handle it.
[29:44.000 --> 29:46.000]  Oh my gosh, I just can't handle it anymore.
[29:46.000 --> 29:48.000]  At least people are crazy.
[29:48.000 --> 29:50.000]  We're on the march.
[29:50.000 --> 29:52.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[29:52.000 --> 30:21.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:22.000 --> 30:27.000]  In short, sodium fluoride is not a nutritional supplement.
[30:27.000 --> 30:41.000]  It is a prescription drug and a dangerous one.
[30:41.000 --> 30:48.000]  FDA recently announced that marketing fluoride drops and tablets for cavity prevention violates federal law
[30:48.000 --> 30:53.000]  because FDA never approved these products as either safe or effective.
[30:53.000 --> 30:54.000]  Don't use fluoride.
[30:54.000 --> 30:59.000]  Use the Alexa Pure water filter to remove contaminants from your water supply.
[30:59.000 --> 31:06.000]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[31:06.000 --> 31:09.000]  Dr. Griff, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[31:09.000 --> 31:15.000]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[31:15.000 --> 31:21.000]  What the aging process is is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[31:21.000 --> 31:24.000]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[31:24.000 --> 31:26.000]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[31:26.000 --> 31:30.000]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[31:30.000 --> 31:33.000]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[31:33.000 --> 31:35.000]  It works like an antioxidant.
[31:35.000 --> 31:38.000]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[31:38.000 --> 31:41.000]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[31:41.000 --> 31:42.000]  It's in powder form.
[31:42.000 --> 31:45.000]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[31:45.000 --> 31:46.000]  I take this.
[31:46.000 --> 31:48.000]  This is the product that I take.
[31:48.000 --> 31:50.000]  Infowarslife.com and the product we make.
[31:50.000 --> 31:51.000]  We fight the globalists.
[31:51.000 --> 31:52.000]  We fight the new world order.

[32:23.000 --> 32:25.000]  Orange peel, zeolites, and others.
[32:25.000 --> 32:27.000]  Deep cleanse doesn't hold back.
[32:27.000 --> 32:31.000]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products,
[32:31.000 --> 32:36.000]  we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[32:36.000 --> 32:41.000]  Look, there's a reason deep cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietaries
[32:41.000 --> 32:43.000]  by Jurex herbal processing technique.
[32:43.000 --> 32:47.000]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs backed by serious research.
[32:47.000 --> 32:50.000]  And we still bring it to you at the best price out there.
[32:50.000 --> 32:53.000]  To find deep cleanse and experience the all-in-one cleansing,

[32:55.000 --> 33:21.000]  Or call 888-253-3139.
[33:25.000 --> 33:41.000]  Imagine being the mainstream media and basically going to meetings with the attorney general at the time.
[33:41.000 --> 33:45.000]  Eric Holder, we're at an RTF banquet, national meeting.
[33:45.000 --> 33:49.000]  It's on C-SPAN and he gets up and he says,
[33:49.000 --> 33:53.000]  listen, it's not enough to just sometimes go out of the Second Amendment to repeal it.
[33:53.000 --> 33:56.000]  I want you to hammer it every segment constantly.
[33:56.000 --> 33:58.000]  I want brainwashing.
[33:58.000 --> 34:02.000]  I want brainwashing.
[34:02.000 --> 34:07.000]  And you fast forward to today.
[34:07.000 --> 34:10.000]  That's why, and I keep going back to this because it's so central,
[34:10.000 --> 34:12.000]  and I'm going to put a special report together on this,
[34:12.000 --> 34:17.000]  showing Gruberg and showing the State Department head spokesman we played yesterday
[34:17.000 --> 34:23.000]  and all these others, Gibbs and others, where they just make jokes about,
[34:23.000 --> 34:29.000]  yeah, we lie to the filth and they're so stupid and it's so much fun to screw them,
[34:29.000 --> 34:32.000]  and triple their prices.
[34:32.000 --> 34:37.000]  Oh, we've got some young college kids here learning about truth and justice and democracy.
[34:37.000 --> 34:54.000]  Yeah. And then you've got total weirdo behavior with this guy obviously out of his mind.
[34:54.000 --> 35:01.000]  In my view, Sadiq Mateen, his son killed 50 plus people.
[35:01.000 --> 35:04.000]  They're like, do you think it's a little weird you're here with Hillary and, you know,
[35:04.000 --> 35:08.000]  your son and all the rest of this, and she's having a memorial for the dead pushing
[35:08.000 --> 35:12.000]  non-control and you're here and, no, nothing weird.
[35:12.000 --> 35:13.000]  No, no, no.
[35:13.000 --> 35:20.000]  You know, don't show your face, buddy, unless you're there apologizing.
[35:20.000 --> 35:24.000]  But no, he has a YouTube show.
[35:24.000 --> 35:26.000]  He does radio and TV interviews.
[35:26.000 --> 35:35.000]  He played them in Pashtun with translations saying the same crap his son said.
[35:35.000 --> 35:39.000]  And I'll tell you what's so whacked out about these freaks.
[35:39.000 --> 35:43.000]  He's just been confirmed the son had a whole bunch of homosexual encounters
[35:43.000 --> 35:50.000]  and was running around on those apps going wild.
[35:50.000 --> 35:53.000]  Talk about total mental patients.
[35:53.000 --> 35:57.000]  People said, well, see, that's not Islam. See, that's why he was conflicted.
[35:57.000 --> 35:59.000]  No, that's what they do in Islam.
[35:59.000 --> 36:03.000]  It has the highest rates of homosexual sex.
[36:03.000 --> 36:09.000]  Look it up.
[36:09.000 --> 36:18.000]  Do people know that Islam pushes that black people aren't humans and calls them raising heads?
[36:18.000 --> 36:20.000]  And I don't want to get off on some jag about Islam.
[36:20.000 --> 36:22.000]  I knew all this stuff 20 years ago.
[36:22.000 --> 36:25.000]  Okay, but I wasn't wanting to have a class of civilizations.
[36:25.000 --> 36:27.000]  I wasn't wanting to go down this path.
[36:27.000 --> 36:29.000]  I know a lot of these people just want to reform.
[36:29.000 --> 36:33.000]  And, you know, Christianity and some of its past has been barbaric as well.
[36:33.000 --> 36:37.000]  People have used it misappropriated. I get it. Okay.
[36:37.000 --> 36:45.000]  But the brand of Islam we've got running us over right now is super screwed up
[36:45.000 --> 36:51.000]  and incredibly oppressive and illiberal, anti-liberal.
[36:51.000 --> 36:54.000]  And I just want to indict the Democratic Party.
[36:54.000 --> 37:00.000]  And I want to indict all of you that are apologists for Islam
[37:00.000 --> 37:05.000]  because you really are bad people.
[37:05.000 --> 37:09.000]  And they're so arrogant and so disconnected.
[37:09.000 --> 37:16.000]  As far as I could look, maybe I'm wrong, but weren't there national issues that
[37:16.000 --> 37:21.000]  Omar Mateen's dad Sadiq never really apologized?
[37:21.000 --> 37:26.000]  Kind of like in this newscast on NBC Local in Orlando.
[37:26.000 --> 37:32.000]  He's come down from New York for this.
[37:32.000 --> 37:36.000]  And he's there. He's not even from there.
[37:36.000 --> 37:40.000]  Last time I checked and he goes, oh, I wish he wouldn't have done what he did.
[37:40.000 --> 37:45.000]  I wish he would have gone and killed ISIS instead. That would have been better.
[37:45.000 --> 37:49.000]  So some half-ass apology. Excuse me, I don't want to use French here.
[37:49.000 --> 37:52.000]  I apologize.
[37:52.000 --> 37:55.000]  I was kind of having a Hillary moment last time when they said, hey boss,
[37:55.000 --> 37:57.000]  are you mad or something? Because you really had your head down.
[37:57.000 --> 38:01.000]  That's what I do. And I'm like, no, I do not know how to respond to this anymore.
[38:01.000 --> 38:07.000]  I hit a wall with weirdness. Hillary obviously is completely insane.
[38:07.000 --> 38:10.000]  She obviously has trouble standing straight up.
[38:10.000 --> 38:14.000]  She comes back to debates late. She looks like she's wearing a diaper.
[38:14.000 --> 38:19.000]  You know, she's going to need one. She reportedly is having seizures like on the hour.
[38:19.000 --> 38:22.000]  And then you swallow yourself.
[38:22.000 --> 38:26.000]  I'm not knocking folks that are in that position. I'm just telling you,
[38:26.000 --> 38:32.000]  the first lady is either wearing bulletproof underwear or she's got a diaper on,
[38:32.000 --> 38:38.000]  which shows she's incontinent.
[38:38.000 --> 38:45.000]  And I just want a symbol for us, a mentally ill, deranged tyrant who's wearing a crap-filled diaper,
[38:45.000 --> 38:53.000]  who's having seizures constantly, and the media is trying to hide it.
[38:53.000 --> 38:56.000]  And then calling it right-wing BS that she's sick.
[38:56.000 --> 39:01.000]  Look at Bill Clinton. Look at photos of him in full light.
[39:01.000 --> 39:07.000]  He looks like a dead body. I've seen dead bodies.
[39:07.000 --> 39:17.000]  I had dead family members that are 80 years old look better than that.
[39:17.000 --> 39:24.000]  And that's when they've been dead for three days.
[39:24.000 --> 39:26.000]  I don't know what to do at this time.
[39:26.000 --> 39:29.000]  And then they're photo shopping everywhere.
[39:29.000 --> 39:33.000]  Just like we said, we can't find Hillary supporters unless I go to the rich part of town,
[39:33.000 --> 39:37.000]  a very small called Terry Town in Austin, and you'll see some of her signs.
[39:37.000 --> 39:41.000]  That's it. There are Bernie Sanders stickers everywhere in Austin.
[39:41.000 --> 39:46.000]  There are Donald Trump stickers all over the place. There are more Bernie.
[39:46.000 --> 39:50.000]  You go outside Austin, there are Donald Trump stickers all over the place.
[39:50.000 --> 39:52.000]  We go all over the country.
[39:52.000 --> 39:58.000]  Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders everywhere. Hillary, nowhere.
[39:58.000 --> 40:01.000]  The exit polls show it. She stole the nomination.
[40:01.000 --> 40:05.000]  We already know all this. That's what's so crazy about this.
[40:05.000 --> 40:08.000]  We already know this.
[40:08.000 --> 40:12.000]  And so all they're doing is positioning us now with a whole spectrum of polls
[40:12.000 --> 40:14.000]  that they've never done it like this.
[40:14.000 --> 40:18.000]  AP Reuters, you name it.
[40:18.000 --> 40:24.000]  Where Trump, even with fixed methodology, went 10 points ahead on her.
[40:24.000 --> 40:26.000]  10 points.
[40:26.000 --> 40:33.000]  And they went, whoa, changed methodology, sampled 15% more Democrats than Republicans.
[40:33.000 --> 40:38.000]  Shoot her ahead. Not even 12 points.
[40:38.000 --> 40:42.000]  In fact, some polls show them, even the new Reuters polls shows her only three points ahead.
[40:42.000 --> 40:47.000]  So they are panicking because that means Hillary must be down at like 25% or something.
[40:47.000 --> 40:50.000]  Almost every blue collar Democrat I talk to goes, I'm going for Trump.
[40:50.000 --> 40:53.000]  I'm sick of Hillary and I'm sick of the Bushes and the establishment.
[40:53.000 --> 40:57.000]  Most of them wanted Sanders. Sanders was the real candidate.
[40:57.000 --> 40:59.000]  That guy could have been president.
[40:59.000 --> 41:02.000]  In fact, I'll be honest with you, as much as disagree with Sanders in-game
[41:02.000 --> 41:05.000]  and what he wants to do at the end of the road, I've looked at the real demographics.
[41:05.000 --> 41:09.000]  I think Bernie Sanders would have beat Donald Trump in a head-to-head real election.
[41:09.000 --> 41:11.000]  I just thought like it is, folks. And I study.
[41:11.000 --> 41:14.000]  And a lot of people, insiders agree with me.
[41:14.000 --> 41:19.000]  Bernie Sanders, America's gone socialist. America's got major problems.
[41:19.000 --> 41:26.000]  But at least they're trying to go after the big bankers. At least the socialists get that there's a super rich that's screwing everybody.
[41:26.000 --> 41:29.000]  But they think it's class warfare. They think free markets the problem.
[41:29.000 --> 41:33.000]  It's a rigged market. That's the problem.
[41:33.000 --> 41:38.000]  But we talked to Sanders people all over the country. You've seen countless interviews we did with them.
[41:38.000 --> 41:42.000]  Well-spoken. They know the issues.
[41:42.000 --> 41:44.000]  We talked to Hillary people, the ones we can finally find.
[41:44.000 --> 41:46.000]  We weren't trying to find people.
[41:46.000 --> 41:52.000]  Mark Dice isn't trying to find people that are mentally retarded.
[41:52.000 --> 41:54.000]  That's who her supporters are.
[41:54.000 --> 42:00.000]  Or they're really polished, slick con artist types.
[42:00.000 --> 42:02.000]  And, you know, you're at the bar where they're going, yeah.
[42:02.000 --> 42:05.000]  So I just hope we get all the guns. I hope she bans them.
[42:05.000 --> 42:08.000]  Oh, I met with her. She's got a, you know, con everybody.
[42:08.000 --> 42:10.000]  But as soon as we get in, we're taking her.
[42:10.000 --> 42:14.000]  Oh, oh, oh, cheers. Oh, oh, oh.
[42:14.000 --> 42:19.000]  Oh, you like my Versace purse. It's 20 grand. Oh, yeah.
[42:19.000 --> 42:25.000]  Let me go out and get my brand in Mercedes or BMW.
[42:25.000 --> 42:29.000]  So if you go to drudgerport.com, it's also up on infowars.com.
[42:29.000 --> 42:33.000]  You can see the photos and the Photoshop right next to it.
[42:33.000 --> 42:36.000]  And again, this is all just part of the rigging.
[42:36.000 --> 42:41.000]  Doesn't matter in full wars is getting 100% more traffic than we just got six months ago.
[42:41.000 --> 42:45.000]  Doesn't matter if we're getting over 100% traffic from six months back.
[42:45.000 --> 42:49.000]  What we got the year before doesn't matter if we're exponentially growing
[42:49.000 --> 42:54.000]  and have seen 300% growth the last two years.
[42:54.000 --> 43:01.000]  300% growth in IP addresses coming into infowars.com.
[43:01.000 --> 43:03.000]  Not to mention all our other platforms.
[43:03.000 --> 43:09.000]  300% conservatively.
[43:09.000 --> 43:11.000]  And do you know and everybody can see it.
[43:11.000 --> 43:16.000]  It's just look, look at info wars everywhere.
[43:16.000 --> 43:24.000]  And then you go to Amazon's Alexa.com and it says we're down by 80%.
[43:24.000 --> 43:29.000]  Oh, oh, and so is drudge. It'd be like Cassius Clay
[43:29.000 --> 43:33.000]  knocking somebody out in the second round and then they say
[43:33.000 --> 43:38.000]  Cassius Clay lost when the guy he beat is bleeding on the ground.
[43:38.000 --> 43:43.000]  And you say, well, at least we've got all the traffic
[43:43.000 --> 43:45.000]  and they're going down, we're going up.
[43:45.000 --> 43:49.000]  The first thing they do is start minimizing you and cutting off your funding
[43:49.000 --> 43:53.000]  so that advertisers don't want to come to you before they send the government
[43:53.000 --> 43:55.000]  and the regulators after you to shut you down.
[43:55.000 --> 43:58.000]  And that's what they're already doing and saying they're going to do.
[43:58.000 --> 44:00.000]  So here's the deal.
[44:00.000 --> 44:05.000]  Do not take this broadcast for granted because they don't want you
[44:05.000 --> 44:09.000]  to see how we can go out and find photos online
[44:09.000 --> 44:11.000]  of what was really at the Hillary event and then show you the news
[44:11.000 --> 44:15.000]  and then show you how it's photoshopped.
[44:15.000 --> 44:19.000]  They don't want us to get a local NBC reporter that slipped through the cracks
[44:19.000 --> 44:22.000]  and actually reported that this jihadi was there.
[44:22.000 --> 44:25.000]  They don't like that info wars takes at one level.
[44:25.000 --> 44:28.000]  The White House has even written about this, media matters, that's who runs it.
[44:28.000 --> 44:32.000]  We take it to one level and then drudge pushes it to another level
[44:32.000 --> 44:40.000]  and then they can't contain it and then they've got a problem.
[44:40.000 --> 44:43.000]  And see then she'll be, she'll lose another five points from this.
[44:43.000 --> 44:46.000]  She'll be down at 25%.
[44:46.000 --> 44:48.000]  Now they've got to jack polls even harder.
[44:48.000 --> 44:52.000]  Now what happens on election night when 80% go in for Trump
[44:52.000 --> 44:57.000]  and then people are there exiting and everybody's for Trump?
[44:57.000 --> 45:01.000]  Oh, you're going to, oh, and then Trump's going to challenge you, didn't he?
[45:01.000 --> 45:03.000]  Let me explain something to you.
[45:03.000 --> 45:06.000]  And I know most of our listeners know this, but Hillary Clinton
[45:06.000 --> 45:12.000]  as the nominee should have 10,000 people per event even in small towns.
[45:12.000 --> 45:18.000]  Trump is having 50 to 75,000 in big cities and he should.
[45:18.000 --> 45:26.000]  I used to go here, Ronald Reagan speaking to be like 100,000 at Fair Park or wherever.
[45:26.000 --> 45:33.000]  And Dallas on my dad's shoulders.
[45:33.000 --> 45:44.000]  And she's got 171 people at her event according to the Secret Service.
[45:44.000 --> 45:45.000]  171.
[45:45.000 --> 45:49.000]  Trump goes to little towns that have 10, 15,000 people
[45:49.000 --> 45:52.000]  and then everybody comes from the other towns to that sports stadium
[45:52.000 --> 45:54.000]  and he'll have 15,000 people.
[45:54.000 --> 45:58.000]  His smallest crowds are 5,000.
[45:58.000 --> 46:03.000]  And to make them look small, they'll get them in a hanger.
[46:03.000 --> 46:05.000]  They'll get them in a stadium that holds 5,000.
[46:05.000 --> 46:08.000]  They'll only let 1,000 in and then they'll pull back and say,
[46:08.000 --> 46:10.000]  look at his small crowd and Trump's too smart.
[46:10.000 --> 46:16.000]  He goes, hey, Fire Marshal wouldn't let the 4,000 people outside in here.
[46:16.000 --> 46:19.000]  That's why day one, he'd say, pull those cameras back.
[46:19.000 --> 46:26.000]  Those people are here. Remember that a year ago? They wouldn't show 50,000, 80,000, 20,000.
[46:26.000 --> 46:29.000]  See, that's why they hate Trump because he's been in the media.
[46:29.000 --> 46:30.000]  He's been in business.
[46:30.000 --> 46:32.000]  He's been an engineer, an economist.
[46:32.000 --> 46:34.000]  He's seen every angle of it.
[46:34.000 --> 46:35.000]  He knows their games.
[46:35.000 --> 46:41.000]  But they'd spin and go, look at him bitch and say in the Fire Marshal, poor fireman, poor firefighter.
[46:41.000 --> 46:43.000]  Turns out the mayor was a Hillary supporter.
[46:43.000 --> 46:44.000]  Get order it.
[46:44.000 --> 46:52.000]  And the same day she came and she thanked him and it turned out the next town that did it.
[46:52.000 --> 46:54.000]  But guess what happens is Trump exposed it twice.
[46:54.000 --> 47:03.000]  They're not doing it anymore in Democrat cities because Trump walks right up to those Fire Marshal
[47:03.000 --> 47:05.000]  and says, I want your name.
[47:05.000 --> 47:08.000]  I want your badge number. I want it all.
[47:08.000 --> 47:13.000]  That building says right there on the entrance that this holds 10,000 people.
[47:13.000 --> 47:20.000]  10,000. You're going to let him in right now.
[47:20.000 --> 47:26.000]  Now he says a little bit nicer than that.
[47:26.000 --> 47:29.000]  But they don't have room for Trump.
[47:29.000 --> 47:38.000]  They don't have room for Trump unless the Fire Marshal shows up because they don't want those images.
[47:38.000 --> 47:44.000]  Bernie Sanders, 10,000, 20,000, Trump, 15,000, 30,000, 50,000.
[47:44.000 --> 47:47.000]  They don't like it.
[47:47.000 --> 47:53.000]  Remember, trusted Ted couldn't get 3,000.
[47:53.000 --> 47:57.000]  Marco Rubio couldn't get 300.
[47:57.000 --> 48:05.000]  Straw men, fake, frauds, hoaxes, garbage, bull manipulation.
[48:05.000 --> 48:12.000]  Hillary's biggest rallies in Cleveland, Ohio, 2,000.
[48:12.000 --> 48:14.000]  We just showed for TV viewers all of it.
[48:14.000 --> 48:18.000]  In fact, we should put special reports out on just this issue.
[48:18.000 --> 48:22.000]  By the way, I don't know how the team just put that together so fast. Bravo.
[48:22.000 --> 48:26.000]  This, this info wars operation, especially the crew behind the scenes,
[48:26.000 --> 48:32.000]  people that actually run things, the graphics, the editing, the research on the TV side and the radio slash TV side.
[48:32.000 --> 48:36.000]  Just amazing folks. I just thank God for them. I'm very, very honored.
[48:36.000 --> 48:39.000]  And I'm very, very thankful to all of you that make this broadcast possible.
[48:39.000 --> 48:41.000]  Let me spend a few minutes talking about that.
[48:41.000 --> 48:50.000]  We are an information warfare system that is organic, that is real, that is extremely strong and getting stronger thanks to your prayers.
[48:50.000 --> 49:11.000]  We sell thousands of cutting edge products and solar panel systems and preparedness items and things that I personally use in my own personal program to be able to fund this operation.
[49:11.000 --> 49:22.000]  And it is so essential. And I want to thank all of you that have supported us that you go to infowarstore.com and that you check out the non GMO heirloom of pollinated seeds, the Hillary for prison shirts.

[49:44.000 --> 49:51.000]  Anthroplex is 40% off. If you like super male vitality, you're going to love anthroplex. They work together in concert.
[49:51.000 --> 49:55.000]  Anthroplex has some ingredients that aren't in super male and vice versa.
[49:55.000 --> 50:00.000]  Anthroplex, the twice daily pill formulated for men that is designed to restore your masculine foundation. It's also great for women.
[50:00.000 --> 50:11.000]  It's not 40% off unprecedented at infowarslife.com. Anthroplex was created to help fight back against the attack on men and simulate natural masculine health with some blend of unique ingredients.

[50:31.000 --> 50:39.000]  We don't pitch this as that, but I've told the story before. I mean, when I was 40, I went to the doctor, had a big physical, all this other stuff done.
[50:39.000 --> 50:43.000]  And I guess this is what the doctors do. They said, hey, you want a prescription of agar, a prescription of C. Alice?
[50:43.000 --> 50:51.000]  And I was like, I don't really need it, but sure, I'll try it out. Try it out. Really, I just don't need it.
[50:51.000 --> 50:57.000]  For me personally, nothing like super male vitality. Same thing with anthroplex. I mean, it's a big effect, but it takes a day.
[50:57.000 --> 51:24.000]  And that's just in general. It's amazing.
[51:24.000 --> 51:29.000]  We'll see you next time.
[51:54.000 --> 51:59.000]  Go to libertyoncall.org. That's libertyoncall.org.

[54:21.000 --> 54:29.000]  We're back live. Joe Biggs is coming up in about 40 minutes. He has been to countless Hillary events, Trump events, you name it.
[54:29.000 --> 54:41.000]  And of course, I don't just believe Joe. Everybody knows this. It's a fact that you've got to get secret service clearance specifically to sit behind Hillary.
[54:41.000 --> 54:47.000]  And that those people are vetted. It's why a lot of times they're all wearing the same t-shirts or whatever because they're from a group.
[54:47.000 --> 54:58.000]  Omar Martin's daddy gets up behind Hillary in the Orlando suburb.
[54:58.000 --> 55:09.000]  Sadiq Martin's gets up there and he says he's proud of it. He says that, you know, there's no reason he shouldn't be able to do this.
[55:09.000 --> 55:25.000]  In fact, we're going to go back to that part and play that in a minute. Sadiq Martin. And now they're saying, hey, that is crazy. That is insane.
[55:25.000 --> 55:35.000]  We didn't invite him up there. We didn't put him behind Hillary. This just shows how disconnected from reality these folks are.
[55:35.000 --> 55:42.000]  Joe Biggs is going to be giving us a cell report later in the next hour. But you're a veteran of this, Joe. You've been through this many, many times.
[55:42.000 --> 55:49.000]  I know you've tried to get behind Hillary. I guess we'll let folks have a little secret so you could unbutton your shirt and have a Hillary for prison.
[55:49.000 --> 55:58.000]  That stunt never worked. We'll just reveal that now. But this new lie that they didn't let him in, that's certainly a fraud, isn't it?
[55:58.000 --> 56:07.000]  Yeah, it's complete and total BS. I mean, I've registered for her emails, her updates all the time, and I get an email saying, hey, there's going to be a Hillary event.
[56:07.000 --> 56:14.000]  There's going to be a Bernie event, a Trump event, so forth and so on, and it's free and open to the public a lot of times. And yes, you can go.
[56:14.000 --> 56:25.000]  But you have to look at the placement of where Sadiq Martin was. He was standing directly behind Hillary Clinton, which means that you've got to be properly vetted to be able to be back there.
[56:25.000 --> 56:34.000]  Now, that usually goes to donors, people who spend a lot of money towards her campaign and have some kind of, it's like a perk for doing that to be able to stand there.
[56:34.000 --> 56:44.000]  So when I go in to cover these events, you already see that crowd behind the podium already full. It's already been selected by the certain people that they want to have there.
[56:44.000 --> 56:51.000]  So for them to come out, the DNC for the Clinton campaign to say, we had no idea that he was going to be there. He wasn't invited.
[56:51.000 --> 56:57.000]  Well, that's just a plain lie. I mean, that's something that we've got to get used to with the Clintons. It's going to be a lie.
[56:57.000 --> 57:04.000]  But I mean, look at this. Look at the kind of people she keeps in her corner. You have the cons, a guy who wants to have Sharia law above all.
[57:04.000 --> 57:10.000]  And then you have Sadiq Mateen, the father of Omar Mateen, who went out and killed a whole bunch of gay people.
[57:10.000 --> 57:23.000]  And he does TV shows, basically. Yes, in California. It's a pro poshtune show that is watched by many poshtune Afghanis and Europeans around America and throughout Europe.
[57:23.000 --> 57:30.000]  Well, I'll tell you what, get us all that information, all that material together. We're showing on screen right now and come in later in the next hour.
[57:30.000 --> 57:36.000]  Let's do a whole report on this so we can get this out to everybody, Joe. Thanks for pointing that out. Roger that.
[57:36.000 --> 57:43.000]  And Joe's got the footage of him trying to, you know, get obviously into that group and it's already preplanned. It's part of the campaign.
[57:43.000 --> 57:48.000]  It's organized by the campaign. And the fact that they're in the news denying it is incredible.
[57:48.000 --> 57:53.000]  Now, I'm going to get to some more of the interview he did with NBC where he doesn't. There's a problem him being there.
[57:53.000 --> 58:00.000]  We're also going to show some video that I should get to now. This is a new video of Hillary having a momentary blackout and dizzy spell.
[58:00.000 --> 58:05.000]  Another video to add to all the other videos. Here it is.
[58:05.000 --> 58:15.000]  About health care. We need to make what we've got work really well and improve it and get the costs out of.
[58:15.000 --> 58:20.000]  Upward spiral.
[58:20.000 --> 58:24.000]  Upward spiral.
[58:24.000 --> 58:29.000]  Now, again, that's a short little clip by itself. You can say it's nothing, but you added into everything else.
[58:29.000 --> 58:38.000]  He clearly is having little seizures. And again, I have an uncle that's got epilepsy from a motorcycle accident.
[58:38.000 --> 58:43.000]  The same thing with him. We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, in 70 seconds, we've got a lot of their economic news.
[58:43.000 --> 58:50.000]  And oh, big news on arresting climate deniers.
[58:50.000 --> 59:00.000]  Yeah, first of all, I want to say, secret 12 X2 Supermale Brain Force Prostagart Silver Bullet. I use them all. They're phenomenal. They work by info.
[59:00.000 --> 59:01.000]  Thank you, brother.
[59:01.000 --> 59:03.000]  Thank you guys for putting those out there.
[59:03.000 --> 59:09.000]  I am a relatively short time listener and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[59:09.000 --> 59:11.000]  Welcome to the info war.
[59:11.000 --> 59:17.000]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the info war at the same time.
[59:17.000 --> 59:21.000]  You're listening by all the nutraceuticals, FUFX, Mason.
[59:21.000 --> 59:23.000]  Let me ask you a question. Have they worked for you?
[59:23.000 --> 59:26.000]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[59:26.000 --> 59:27.000]  What products are you taking?
[59:27.000 --> 59:33.000]  Everything from Supermale to Brain Force to Winter Sun X2.
[59:33.000 --> 59:39.000]  Even got a little DNA force. So when I just free up everything and I just went to Autoville.
[59:39.000 --> 59:44.000]  Visit infowarslife.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourself.
[59:44.000 --> 59:49.000]  That's infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[1:00:14.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  Now, if you just joined us, I want to be very, very clear.
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  I don't think the number one story in the world is Omar Mateen, the mass murderer from the gay Orlando nightclub that killed 50 plus people.
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:42.000]  I don't think that it's the number one story in the world that his dad showed up in a suburb of Orlando yesterday
[1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  and was part of a vetted group behind Hillary Clinton.
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  And then he went on the news and said he was basically proud of Hillary Clinton and how wonderful she is.
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  And by that, I don't mean that story by itself is the most important.
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  But what it's illustrative of, what it shows you is the total disconnect and the absolute ignorance.
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  And the fact that there is such a love, such a fellow traveler attitude with the Islamists and the Democratic Party,
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  even though the two groups supposedly don't agree with each other on almost anything,
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  that they would have this guy be vetted by the Secret Service and put behind her
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  and that he wouldn't even think that there was an issue with the fact that, hey, your son killed all these people.
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  Is it a good thing that you're here?
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  So I want to play that clip for folks because, again, it just shows how the establishment
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:44.000]  and even their minions are smoking their own propaganda.
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  They're smoking their own bull.
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  They're buying their own baloney.
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  And that's scary because this is an establishment that's making a lot of really dangerous moves worldwide
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  and even mainline analysts, retired generals, foreign leaders are saying, what are you doing?
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  Well, no one ever acted like this before from the West.
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  And we have a bunch of people that have overthrown our institutions who still act like their revolutionaries when they're in charge.
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  And that's very dangerous.
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  And the late actor, Ron Silver, who is a big leftist and better known as being a producer than he was in films like Die Hard,
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  he was at the Clinton's inauguration in 1993 and F-16s flew over.
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  And this guy was so disconnected from reality, such an America hater,
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  that he famously in front of newspaper reporters and Democrats went, how dare them fly those over and threaten us?
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  And they went, Ron, it's OK.
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  There are jets now.
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:50.000]  And see, that tells you everything you have to know about those people.
[1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  They are just people with guns, American flags.
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  There's just a bunch of neurotic fruits.
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  And they just haven't lived in the real world.
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  Here is the daddy of the nightclub killer, the mass murderer Omar Matine's papa at the Hillary event.
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:12.000]  Here he is.
[1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  Clinton's campaign, know that you were going to that event and sitting right directly behind her?
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  It's a Democratic party, so everybody can join.
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  Do you think that some people will be surprised to know and to see that you were there in Orlando or near Orlando?
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  Why they should be surprised?
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  I love the United States and I've been living here for a long time.
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  Why are you busy? I only do TV show for Taliban and Pashtun and family help bring in refugee, me friend, me hook into CIA.
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  This guy was brought here.
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  And it's just all designed in social engineering to bring in incompatible people.
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  Can we put up the photos again of the Islamic women in the teletubbie outfits?
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  I mean, that's what they are.
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  If you don't know what teletubbie are, they're like these little space alien things, these little hats that look like they will condom in on the back of their head, a little antenna.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  And I mean, that's what these women are wearing, these teletubbie outfits.
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  And then here they are playing these other women.
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  And it's just like, look at the future, look at science, look at all the high-tech gear in those bikinis.
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  And then just all the coding and science and everything else that goes into God's amazing designs.
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  Such a fan of God's artwork, I can tell you.
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  And then meanwhile, you've got this demonic cult covering it up.
[1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  And I just, I don't like it.
[1:04:57.000 --> 1:05:03.000]  It's okay, I'll explain it.
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:34.000]  In this photo, CNN's Brian Settler writes that news aggregator Matt Drudge is taking a six-month-old photo out of context.
[1:05:34.000 --> 1:05:40.000]  Settler claims that the images merely show Hillary being aided after a slip and dismisses concerns about Hillary's health.
[1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:43.000]  In addition, the claims of John Cardio are not mentioned.
[1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:53.000]  Cardio told Reitbart about two different individuals, one a federal agent and another an NYPD officer who'd worked security at a Hillary event in New York City,
[1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:56.000]  who both personally witnessed Hillary's walking difficulties.
[1:05:56.000 --> 1:05:59.000]  This has been Joe Biggs with infowars.com.
[1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:31.000]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites.
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:33.000]  Tell us about all the stuff that's said, there's so many things that are in it.
[1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:38.000]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:41.000]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:44.000]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:47.000]  It just came back in yesterday, Living Defense, infowarslife.com.
[1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  And folks, you can't lose full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:56.000]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com. Thank you, Dr. Grieff from the Global Healing Center.
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:07:21.000]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:33.000]  Thank you, Dr. Grieff.
[1:07:56.000 --> 1:08:24.000]  We are on the march. The empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  Fox News has got its medical team come out, we're going to play a clip of that here in just a few minutes,
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  and said, look, she needs to release her neurology records.
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  And I was thinking, who better to bring on somebody that's known, Hillary Clinton,
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:46.000]  somebody who's been in the council on foreign relations, somebody who was the head of psychological warfare
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  for the State Department, a co-author of many of Tom Clancy's books as well,
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  Dr. Steve Pachennick of StevePachennick.com. He's an MD and PhD, an American psychiatrist,
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:08:59.000]  former State Department official, author and publisher.
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  So he has MIT degree as well, trained in psychiatry at Harvard and international relations at MIT
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:10.000]  to specifically talk about Hillary.
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  Look, it always comes up in elections to say somebody's got a health problem
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  or somebody doesn't have a health problem, and a lot of times it's a red herring.
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  But with Hillary, every day now, she doesn't know where she's at.
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:26.000]  She suddenly starts having clearly seizures.
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  Again, I have an uncle who's in a motorcycle accident, and you'll be sitting there with him.
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  He'll suddenly start doing the exact same thing she does.
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  When she was out under the bright lights at the DNC, started doing it repeatedly.
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  She's falling and stumbling downstairs.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  She looks bad. She has lesions on her tongue.
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:46.000]  Dr. Steve Pachennick isn't just a top psychiatrist.
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  He was a board examiner and ran entire medical facilities.
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:56.000]  And so he was also bringing up the fact that Charles Krauthammer had, at one time,
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  actually worked under him in one of these programs.
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  So to break all of this down, and Krauthammer's saying there's serious questions as well,
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  is Dr. Steve Pachennick, doctors specifically, go over your background for folks
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  that may not know who you are, your curriculum background, your letters,
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  and then let's get specifically into what you're seeing with Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  Number one, my background is I went to Cornell Medical School, received my MD in 1968.
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  Then I went to Harvard in 1971, became a psychiatrist.
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  At the same time, I went to MIT to receive my PhD in international relations.
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  I became board certified, and eventually I was brought in as a board examiner in neurology and psychiatry.
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  But in my private practice in Washington, D.C., despite also working at the State Department,
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  at the desk, under Nixon, Ford, Reagan, Bush, and others,
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:04.000]  I also treated congressmen, senators, and major politicians.
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  I clearly won't say who.
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  The key issue for me and why I'm grateful you brought me on the show again,
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:16.000]  and as you know, you didn't know what I was about to say, and I didn't want anybody to know,
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  but the point of fact is the two physicians, Dr. Siegel and the other gentleman from Mount Sinai,
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  who are on Fox News, were absolutely correct, as was Charlie Krauthammer,
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  for demanding that we have an independent investigation of Hillary Clinton.
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  Why do I say that?
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  Number one, for some time now, she has had a history of seizures.
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  When she says she has a hard time going up the steps, she's totally confused.
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  And in one of the most revealing interviews that was done on Fox News, where Chris Wallace repeatedly asked her,
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  did you or did you not commit a malfeasance or felony with the emails?
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  She just repeated total lies.
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  In my business, given the fact that she had a history of three major concussions,
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  1998, 2009, 2012, she could put on anti-coagulant,
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  and I will go over her medical record as it was written by her internist, Lisa Bardak,
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  she evidences a serious problem of neurological and cognitive deficit in the brain,
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  be it post-stroke syndrome or if I said if you have constant thrombosis in the brain,
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  you have to look for occult tumors, occult tumors meaning secret tumors that are in the brain,
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  or biopsied when she was at the Physician's Insurgents' Columbia in 2012 and remained there for six months.
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  There's no question in my mind that Columbia Physician Insurgents has a mandate to reveal the CAT scans,
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  the MRI, and every test that they had done regarding Hillary Clinton's physical staff.
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  Absolutely, so just release it all and you don't have any excuses to do it,
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  or you're hiding something clearly.
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:24.000]  Correct. Now, let me go over this, Alex, and I appreciate it.
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  I want the audience to understand, as most of the audience realizes.
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  I don't usually come on the show unless I have something that I'd like to tell the American audience,
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:38.000]  which is very, very important.
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  As part of the other issue in my world as a psychological operations and intelligence offer and as a desk,
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  I used to give lectures on presidential health at Fort McNair and West Point,
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  and what I used to go over was how we in the Republic hide the health of our president.
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  And I start with Woodrow Wilson, who had a stroke, and for a year and a half,
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:10.000]  he was in a semi-comatose, comatose state where Colonel House and his wife was running the White House.
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:12.000]  We can't have that.
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  Secondly, we had FDR, who was a cripple, and the Secret Service made certain that no one,
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:27.000]  but no one took pictures of Franklin Roosevelt as a cripple in the administration he was in.
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  Then we had a far more serious problem.
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:34.000]  When I was at Cornell Medical School between 64 and 68,
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  a pathology class was given to us that really revealed the story of an individual who went into surgery
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:46.000]  at Cornell in orthopedic surgery and became psychotic.
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  Who was that individual?
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  It was John F. Kennedy.
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  Subsequently, we found out that John F. Kennedy came into the White House illegally and in the Navy illegally
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  because he had an Addison's disease, ADD-IS-ONS,
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  which meant that he had a deficiency in absence of the adrenal gland
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  and had to be given daily shots of steroids, amphetamines, and vitamins from Dr. Fieldgood.
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:19.000]  As a result of that, he became psychotic, inappropriate,
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  and we ended up with the Cuban missile crisis because Khrushchev saw exactly what was happening,
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  that we had a totally disoriented, incapable president, and eventually he had to go.
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  Subsequently, we had a problem with Nixon, whom I had worked with not directly.
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  He had stressed and had developed thromophlebitis.
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:46.000]  He became paranoid as a result of Watergate and he had to leave.
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:54.000]  We then had a president whom I worked under, I did not work directly for, who had Alzheimer's,
[1:15:54.000 --> 1:16:01.000]  whether he had Alzheimer's towards the end of his administration or from the beginning is a very serious question.
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:08.000]  There's no question in my mind that during the Reagan administration, I had been working for James Baker
[1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:13.000]  as well as Bush, a senior, who was then the vice president.
[1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:19.000]  Now we have a case where you have complete sociopathy, you have lies upon lies.
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:24.000]  There's no question her personality is one of a complete sociopath.
[1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:31.000]  Whatever they're saying about Trump right now, that he's sociopathic, he's not capable, he's impulsive,
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:38.000]  that's all nonsense coming from 50 totally incompetent Republicans whom I know personally
[1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:40.000]  and had worked with.
[1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:45.000]  Michael Hayden, who's director of the CIA and was the director of the National Security Agency,
[1:16:45.000 --> 1:16:52.000]  was nothing more than a political general. In the military intelligence field, as one of my generals once said,
[1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:56.000]  he's a moron and he was not considered the brightest of all.
[1:16:56.000 --> 1:17:04.000]  The only man I would respect among all of them was John Negroponte, who was a serious ambassador.
[1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:09.000]  Dr. Pachinic, again, you have treated world leaders, treated US leaders, that's all on record.
[1:17:09.000 --> 1:17:16.000]  So you are an expert of experts, you are sitting here, certified to look at this neurology as an MD and as a psychiatrist,
[1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:20.000]  on record, and the former head of psychological warfare of the State Department.
[1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:24.000]  So you're perfectly, you know, the best person in the world to talk to on this.
[1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:28.000]  I'm not a rocket scientist, but I can ask somebody, hey, do you have Parkinson's disease?
[1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:35.000]  Yes, I do. I mean, I can see when someone looks like they have a neurological disorder, Parkinson's type, you know, spectrum or whatever.
[1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:40.000]  Now, when, I'm not a doctor, I have no training in it, but I can just, I've seen it enough to know what it is.
[1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:47.000]  You, as a truly educated expert, six months a few years ago, disappearing into this brain tumor specialist facility,
[1:17:47.000 --> 1:17:56.000]  all the bizarre behavior, her obviously degenerating, acting so angry, looking disoriented, having many seizures,
[1:17:56.000 --> 1:18:04.000]  looking at her, just in the videos you see online, if you saw that of a layperson, what would you say is wrong with them?
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:16.000]  I would say that she has a cult brain tumor, either glioblastoma, or that she has possibly an onset of Alzheimer's disease,
[1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:27.000]  which begins as what we would call a subcortical vascular dementia because of thrombosis to the brain.
[1:18:27.000 --> 1:18:35.000]  Either way, it has to be ruled out. If she has early onset dementia, which she may well have,
[1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:42.000]  which came out in the issue with Chris Wallace and her quick discussion as a short circuit,
[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:49.000]  and then Keene, Keene, her vice president, took over, it clearly said to me that
[1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:57.000]  Hillary, at this point, is not qualified physically, mentally, or emotionally to be the president of the United States,
[1:18:57.000 --> 1:19:02.000]  unless she has given a clean record of health, which I doubt will happen.
[1:19:02.000 --> 1:19:12.000]  Now, let me give you exactly what happened. They produced the most cockamamie or a very run-down or watered-down medical history.
[1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:22.000]  This is public. Her primary care physician is Dr. Lisa Bardek. I don't know who she is. She's an internist consistent with her position.
[1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:27.000]  She's the chairman and department of medicine at Mount Kisco, New York.
[1:19:27.000 --> 1:19:34.000]  Now, you're talking about a very small town in comparison to where Hillary was really treated,
[1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:42.000]  which was physicians and surgeons at Columbia. And Columbia knows very well, the neurologist then know very well,
[1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:47.000]  that she was worked up with an MRI, CAT scans, and everything else.
[1:19:47.000 --> 1:19:51.000]  Sure. So what they're doing is she's going to some local treating physician, doing a limited thing,
[1:19:51.000 --> 1:19:56.000]  not sharing the other medical records from years ago, and then putting that out as her supposed medical history.
[1:19:56.000 --> 1:20:02.000]  Correct. Then she has anti-coagulant treatment. Now, is she still on any coagulant? We have to know that.
[1:20:02.000 --> 1:20:11.000]  That means she's bleeding out. She had three episodes of concussions that she even documented, 98, 2009, and 2012,
[1:20:11.000 --> 1:20:18.000]  where she had to be treated for 12 months. She wore a glasses that are called Fresnel Prism Glasses,
[1:20:18.000 --> 1:20:25.000]  which are usually worn by patients who have diplopia or double vision, and they have to be able to see better.
[1:20:25.000 --> 1:20:29.000]  And that was shown in the Benghazi inquiry.
[1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:36.000]  Yes, sir. What are you seeing when you see her, what looks like as a layperson, a seizure, where she seems to not have balance,
[1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:41.000]  and then she's been taught to smile and act like it's fun, but people say, are you okay?
[1:20:41.000 --> 1:20:48.000]  Well, what you see there is the classical petite mouth, which can go into a grandmouth seizure.
[1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:54.000]  And then what I saw was the gentleman who came by her, then secret service, and gave her diazepam,
[1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:58.000]  which is valium, in order to reduce the seizure activity.
[1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:05.000]  And that's the key. They're running up, injecting her with, what, I guess, a depressant to stop the brain activity?
[1:21:05.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  Yes, an anti-convulsant medication. She would be on dialatin in other parts.
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:15.000]  But here's the issue. The issue I'm getting to is far greater than even Hillary Clinton.
[1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:23.000]  It's the problem that we have with the secret service, with the FBI and the CIA, and I come back to it again and again and again.
[1:21:23.000 --> 1:21:35.000]  I don't wish her illness, but I do condemn the secret service for the fact that their only loyalty is to their job and to the President of the United States.
[1:21:35.000 --> 1:21:44.000]  It is not to the Republic. They have covered up more malfeasance, more irregularity, and more miscreant behavior.
[1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:49.000]  Dr. Virginia, we'll get into that, and I'm glad that you're making this a compending. I'm not just about Hillary Clinton.
[1:21:49.000 --> 1:21:56.000]  There's a history of this. Sure, sure. There's a history of it. You know Hillary. You've not even really bashed her on this show.
[1:21:56.000 --> 1:22:03.000]  You've even said nice things about her. The larger issue, though, is she looks extremely out of it.
[1:22:03.000 --> 1:22:07.000]  It's one thing if the President's got a heart problem. It's one thing if they've even, you know, got a cancer that can be treated.
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:16.000]  But if she looks so angry, looks so crazed, or looks out of it, and is reportedly so mean and so rude to people now,
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:22.000]  I mean, to me, that just is what I've heard about Alzheimer's or dementia, and it shows she's degenerating very, very quickly.
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:28.000]  I'm just concerned about putting somebody like her in power, I mean, for the obvious reasons.
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:34.000]  So what do you think she's specifically done? Obviously, call for the release of her full medical records. What else?
[1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:42.000]  Well, there's call for release of her full medical records. At the same time, I would want Congress to call in the secret service
[1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:46.000]  to demand exactly what they had witnessed, what they have seen under oath.
[1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:52.000]  What are you injecting her with? There should be congressional hearings. Why is a person follow her with a tranquilizer dart?
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:23:03.000]  They won't do that because it'll look partisan. But at the same time, I would put a gag order on everyone who's involved in any way in adding ad hominem comments.
[1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:13.000]  I mean, the fact that 50 Republican experts, all of them were neocons, Zellico, you have Zellico.
[1:23:13.000 --> 1:23:16.000]  No, I get it. You don't want political points. You care about the Republic.
[1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:24.000]  I don't care about the political points. I care about the mental health and the medical health of this woman, and it has to be addressed.
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:27.000]  Is she unfit to be the nominee?
[1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:36.000]  At this point, yes. Unless proven otherwise, she is not qualified to be the president of the United States as of today.
[1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:43.000]  She neither has the mental capacity, the physical capacity as we've seen them bring her up.
[1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:47.000]  I interrupt you, Dr. Pachennick. Start over with that statement because we're going to put this out. Start over.
[1:23:47.000 --> 1:23:58.000]  I demand that she have an independent, medical, neurological evaluation by people who are neither Republicans nor Democrats
[1:23:58.000 --> 1:24:04.000]  to evaluate her mental status and physical status to be the president of the United States.
[1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:15.000]  I demand that Columbia P&S release the record on the neurological workup of a president of the United States, a potential president.
[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:21.000]  Columbia has a far greater obligation to the country than it does to its patients.
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:32.000]  The HIPAA law, which ironically was brought in by Bill Clinton, has to be broken because it's a far greater issue than a concern of one individual.
[1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:35.000]  We are now talking about the nation state.
[1:24:35.000 --> 1:24:46.000]  What we've seen is a lot of distraction of a group of her people, including Republicans who may or may not have been co-opted to say that Trump is impulsive, he's erratic.
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:53.000]  In fact, the reality is that's a lot of distortion and distraction which belongs to her.
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:25:06.000]  Trump actually found Trump is super disciplined and is just like a workhorse and very, very calm and focused in private.
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  I don't want to get into the politics, but let's make it very clear.
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:17.000]  There is no history that I know about Trump where he has actually killed individuals intentionally or unintentionally.
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:22.000]  Trump hasn't gone around and destabilized all these countries and said, I came, I saw, he died.
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:27.000]  We can honestly say her judgment about Libya isn't questioned.
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:43.000]  Was it her judgment because she thought that was the best thing to do or did she have an underlying psychological, neurological problem which compelled her to act and be aggressive and go to war as she did in Iraq and elsewhere?
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:46.000]  Well, that was my next question because you are a top psychiatrist.
[1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:47.000]  Let me expand on that.
[1:25:47.000 --> 1:25:57.000]  A lot of times you read about dementia, you read about brain tumors, people tend to start acting like kids, they tend to have rages, they tend to get aggressive in a lot of videos.
[1:25:57.000 --> 1:26:08.000]  I thought it was just her acting like a kid for her audience, but more and more I see her on C-spanning things off of the side acting like a little kid but also kind of raging and stomping around.
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:10.000]  What is that indicative of, doctor?
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:20.000]  It's indicative of onset of possibly dementia, that dementia in her case would not be unusual because she's 69 years old, going on 70.
[1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:33.000]  With all due respect to her, she's been under a lot of stress, she's flown all over the world, she has been dehydrated, but she has a well-known history of having concussions.
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:54.000]  Not just one concussion, but concussions in 1998, 2009, and a major concussion in 2012 where she had to wear the Fresno Prisms, which means that she has an ongoing post-concussion syndrome and or a glioblastoma or an onset of dementia or all three.
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:27:03.000]  But without an independent evaluation, without the release of the records from Columbia, not from this Dr. Louis Bardek, I don't know who she is.
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:10.000]  No, understand, release the real medical records. Why was she disappeared for a year, six months in treatment? That's not blood clots.
[1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  No, that is far more serious than a blood clot.
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:26.000]  And also, usually when I examine the resident, I often ask, what does it mean when you have a history of multiple blood clots? Now, usually, most residents don't know that.
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:34.000]  The answer is that we have a hidden tumor, and in this case, a well-beaked glioblastoma, which is a very serious tumor.
[1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:38.000]  And by hidden, sir, can you give us the technicals? Do you mean it's a deep tumor?
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:45.000]  Deep tumor, which is quite aggressive or can be controlled with chemotherapy, radiation, or some other...
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:50.000]  Well, we have to speculate. I mean, she looks pretty bad. She disappears for large periods of time.
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:53.000]  She has to be in the bathroom longer during a debate.
[1:27:53.000 --> 1:28:05.000]  Correct. If this would occur in Trump right now, if Trump were to evidence the kind of behavior that she evidenced with all due respect, we would immediately have asked for Trump's background
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:09.000]  in terms of medical history, psychiatric history, and all.
[1:28:09.000 --> 1:28:21.000]  It's also interesting that throughout her whole life, even as a senator, she keeps on tabulating a story where she created all kinds of economic opportunity.
[1:28:21.000 --> 1:28:26.000]  Yet today, I wrote a whole blog saying that she didn't create any jobs in New York State.
[1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:36.000]  In fact, 25% of the jobs went under through her eight years of a tenureship and then had to pay the Houghton family, who was a corning glass.
[1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:46.000]  She paid them $330,000 for speeches, paid $220,000 to the eBay family when she, in fact, accomplished nothing.
[1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:47.000]  So what you have to...
[1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:55.000]  Well, let's expand on this. What does the psychology say of her and Bill that they would steal the George Washington plates and cutlery?
[1:28:55.000 --> 1:29:07.000]  Well, in that sense, you have, what I've always said, you have basically a very low-class sociopathic family, which really is an arrangement of two people.
[1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:09.000]  You're talking about white trash.
[1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:14.000]  In effect, yeah, that's not a diagnosis, but Bill has never been honest.
[1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:17.000]  Bill has never accomplished really anything.
[1:29:17.000 --> 1:29:27.000]  Bill is born of a mother who was in the prostitute business. He came out of Hope, Arkansas, which was the headquarters of the mob for the Jews and the Italians.
[1:29:27.000 --> 1:29:30.000]  And I mean, that history is well known.
[1:29:30.000 --> 1:29:40.000]  But to come forth and then bring us again another problem of sociopathy, we have to start to ask the question, what's the underlying mental...
[1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:49.000]  Let's answer that straight ahead and talk about the Iran 400 million. Then we're going to shift gears into the mass murders father showing up at the Hillary rally.
[1:29:49.000 --> 1:29:52.000]  We're on the March. The Empire's on the run.
[1:29:52.000 --> 1:30:11.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:22.000 --> 1:30:26.000]  Humans have no known physiological requirement for fluoride.
[1:30:26.000 --> 1:30:34.000]  Sodium fluoride, long known as an effective roach poison, is added to tablets and drops for the purpose of preventing tooth decay.
[1:30:34.000 --> 1:30:41.000]  In short, sodium fluoride is not a nutritional supplement. It is a prescription drug and a dangerous one.
[1:30:41.000 --> 1:30:53.000]  FDA recently announced that marketing fluoride drops and tablets for cavity prevention violates federal law because FDA never approved these products as either safe or effective.
[1:30:53.000 --> 1:31:11.000]  Don't use fluoride. Use the Alexa pure water filter to remove contaminants from your water supply.
[1:31:24.000 --> 1:31:29.000]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.

[1:31:53.000 --> 1:32:14.000]  Hey everyone, pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of the Bright Side and as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[1:32:14.000 --> 1:32:25.000]  Obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease and autoimmune illnesses are rampant. One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[1:32:25.000 --> 1:32:38.000]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day to day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients,
[1:32:38.000 --> 1:32:46.000]  the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats and amino acids it needs to do its healing work, you need to check out infoworseteam.com.

[1:33:16.000 --> 1:33:36.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:47.000]  So I signed by the name of another 24, hey!
[1:33:47.000 --> 1:33:54.000]  Yeah, I just said four, just one more.
[1:33:54.000 --> 1:34:14.000]  We are back live, Dr. Steve Pochinnick, MD slash psychiatrist, a board-certifying individual who's run entire federal facilities, treated presidents, you name it, went through a whole history earlier of how there's this long-term program of bipartisanly of covering up serious illnesses,
[1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:24.000]  a lot of times because vice presidents and others want to basically be running the show. That means George Soros, I guess, in the case of Hillary.
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:37.000]  But Hillary is falling down, she suddenly doesn't know who she is in press conferences, she won't give press conferences, she spent often on a year in a very secretive medical facility that deals with brain tumors.
[1:34:37.000 --> 1:34:47.000]  I wanted to play a brief clip before we shift here to another subject with him, since he mentioned it, this Fox News clip from Hannity. What do Hillary's Clinton's neurological records show?
[1:34:47.000 --> 1:34:58.000]  Not the one she put out from her little family doctor in New York that are just limited, but the real ones, the CAT scans, her true records. Here's a clip.
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:13.000]  The picture which shows Hillary Clinton apparently needing assistance to climb a flight of stairs at a campaign stop back in February was picked up by the Drudge Report, which posted this headline over the weekend detailing Hillary Clinton's history with falls
[1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:25.000]  and speculating that the former Secretary of State could be experiencing a serious undisclosed medical condition. Earlier today we reached out to the Clinton campaign for a statement, and a spokesman told us that the Drudge Report is shameful.
[1:35:25.000 --> 1:35:39.000]  And anyone who buys into that vitriol, including yours truly, is shameful as well. So shameful we are. Anyway, what was noticeably missing from the statement was any reference or a buttle to the health issues that are alleged by Drudge and others.
[1:35:39.000 --> 1:35:46.000]  Jim Hopped in an article, and you know, Hillary's handler, I guess, called with a diazepam pen. What would that be for?
[1:35:46.000 --> 1:35:59.000]  So one of the things that happens after having concussion, usually within a year or so, you should read all the symptoms should resolve. Occasionally you have a latent or delayed kind of post concussion syndromes and seizure is one of the
[1:35:59.000 --> 1:36:01.000]  traumatic head issues for football players.
[1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:05.000]  Exactly what it is. And that can come years down the road. She may have some of the symptoms.
[1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:06.000]  You think that's what you're seeing?
[1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:16.000]  Well, I certainly think that a traumatic brain injury with symptoms down the road is very, very likely here, especially since she had a blood clot on her brain. And as David was mentioning, that can actually lead to a seizure problem.
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:25.000]  Someone's carrying a pen that you would use in the case of a seizure, a valium pen. That makes me wonder about that. We need to see her records to see what's the sequelae.
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:26.000]  They want Donald Trump's tax rate.
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:31.000]  There's two things we want from her. We want her speeches to Wall Street and the medical records in full.
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:42.000]  Well said. I mean, how is that shameful when she's falling down? She's obviously having seizures. She looks worse. She's got weird lesions, rotholes on her tongue and multiple shots.
[1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:50.000]  She either acts disoriented or like a crazy, I mean, I don't mean to be mean. I'm not a neurologist. I'm not a psychiatrist.
[1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:59.000]  I've seen Down syndrome children when they are either really bummed out depressed or they get these euphoric crazy things where they look up and look like the Joker.
[1:36:59.000 --> 1:37:08.000]  I mean, she just acts like a crazy person. I mean, she acts like a crazy schizophrenic would, you know, at a four-way stop in downtown Austin.
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:17.000]  And she looks like a bag lady with her. I mean, I'm not being mean here, folks. I'm telling you, she looks like a classically insane person.
[1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:26.000]  Is that caused by a brain tumor? Is it caused by something else? I mean, everyone's just going with the story that, oh, she was in the hospital off and on for a year for a blood clot.
[1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:37.000]  Dr. Steve Pacinic, again, formerly a Burt's board certifying psychiatrist, MD, former head of psychological warfare for the State Department, you know, a guy that ran entire medical facilities.
[1:37:37.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  I mean, snapshot of this dead reckoning. Is this a woman getting better from something or worse?
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:52.000]  There's no question she's worse. Let me say something. She's not schizophrenic. Let me put the correct words.
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:38:03.000]  I know you're saying it in your late terms. And remember, they're going to accuse us, you and me, of being conspiratorial since we've been doing this since 2001.
[1:38:03.000 --> 1:38:06.000]  Sir, I totally understand. I'm saying I'm a late person. I'm saying she just...
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:17.000]  Alex, I'm not apologizing. All I'm saying to your audience is when we first said that 9-11 was a stand-down, everybody said we were crazy.
[1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:30.000]  And now it's come out. And that came... Now we know it was true. In the same way I'm saying, as I said, 13, 14 years ago, Hillary Clinton and I wish her no illness.
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  I've known her before. I've met her. She's a good mother. And Bill Clinton was a good mother to Chelsea. I happen to know that.
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:55.000]  But the reality is, when you see her now for whatever reason, as a physician, as somebody who is an official within the State Department, and still helps our government for free, and if cares about our presidency,
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:39:06.000]  I have nothing against Hillary per se. I'm just simply stating that her history of sociopathy, her history of ongoing denial and distortion,
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:16.000]  particularly when Chris Wallace interviewed her and said, you're lying. Everything you said about Comey was the reverse.
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:27.000]  It can manifest itself as confabulation, as an issue within herself of having a history of severe concussions, three to four times possibly.
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:41.000]  We know it's in 1998. We know it's in 2009. We know in 2012 Bill Clinton even stated clearly she was in the hospital for six months under the care of physicians and surgeons.
[1:39:41.000 --> 1:39:52.000]  Here is what has to be done. Physicians and surgeons must open their records, not because they're doctors and not because they're sanctimonious and not because they hit the laws.
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:40:02.000]  We have to open those records because the state of the nation and possibly the world depends on what her mental health is and her medical condition.
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:07.000]  That's right. When you want to be the president of the United States, you then make yourself open to the public.
[1:40:07.000 --> 1:40:13.000]  Things that were private now must be public because you now represent us, and I certainly agree.
[1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  So in closing, if you have to deadwreck and, Dr. Petrenik, I'll spend a few minutes on another issue and then let you go and you're busy.
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  No, let me say the second part. There's no question the Secret Service has to be brought before Congress to assess under oath what they have done and what they have seen.
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:41.000]  Not one of these things where they remain their fraternities and then they write their books. That's not going to be acceptable.
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:49.000]  The Secret Service will be indicted for collusion in terms of creating a problem for the United States of America.
[1:40:49.000 --> 1:41:00.000]  Their loyalty is to the people of the United States, not to the presidency. Either they're funded by us and they respond to our request or we defund them.
[1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:11.000]  There is no question the Secret Service for 50 to 60 years has covered up major malfeasance and malpractice that occurred.
[1:41:11.000 --> 1:41:13.000]  They want to expose Hillary and others.
[1:41:13.000 --> 1:41:20.000]  It's the same thing. They covered up for John F. Kennedy. They covered up for Reagan. They covered up for a whole group of people.
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:25.000]  If that's in fact what they do, then they are in collusion with malfeasance.
[1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:34.000]  The bottom line, we need to get these documents out. I think it's becoming a major issue and clearly Trump is dead in her head in the real polls.
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:43.000]  They're putting out fake polls. There's a former top psychological warfare expert that's helped keep governments in power, overthrow foreign governments.
[1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:47.000]  People that don't know you are, you're a rock star of that. Probably more than anybody living.
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:59.000]  Dr. Steve Pacinac, looking at this election, just as a media analyst, I've never seen them photoshopping things, delisting Google, dirty tricks against Donald Trump.
[1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:03.000]  A, do you agree with that statement and B, why are they pulling out all the stops?
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:11.000]  Because they're frightened. And also, this is the modus operandi of the Clinton machinery. They have always been crooked.
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:21.000]  When Clinton came in the first time around and I worked for Bush Senior, I said to one of my CIA operatives, what in fact happened?
[1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:29.000]  How did this guy from Arkansas, who nobody knew, we knew in the State Department that he was receiving money from mainland China?
[1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:37.000]  That was in 88, 89. And my CIA operative told me he's been on the payroll of the Chinese and they stole the election.
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:46.000]  Remember the old Stalin statement? It's not how many people vote or who votes. It's the person who counts the votes.
[1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:55.000]  And whether they adopted the machinery, whether they haven't doctored it, they are completely complicit in malfeasance and activity.
[1:42:55.000 --> 1:43:01.000]  Let me tell you this. I can't go see a movie like The Martian.
[1:43:01.000 --> 1:43:03.000]  No, it's a waste of time.
[1:43:03.000 --> 1:43:14.000]  I can't go see the new Star Trek movie, none of them. Every major action movie or sci-fi movie is how great the Communist Chinese are with bullet bureaus, red flags.
[1:43:14.000 --> 1:43:23.000]  The Starlet Girl is a Communist Chinese colonel. We get our rocket boosters and The Martian from the Communist Chinese to save our mission because we're idiots.
[1:43:23.000 --> 1:43:29.000]  I mean, it's like Hollywood has become, because that's how you know who you're working for.
[1:43:29.000 --> 1:43:37.000]  I mean, Hollywood now, when I see almost any movie, there is red Chinese propaganda in it and this just started happening two years ago.
[1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:39.000]  And let me tell you, it is freaking me out.
[1:43:39.000 --> 1:43:45.000]  Well, I wouldn't worry about Hollywood. Having been a producer and I'm part of the producer's guild, Hollywood is finished.
[1:43:45.000 --> 1:43:50.000]  They have no more capability to develop films than the past.
[1:43:50.000 --> 1:43:54.000]  No, I agree with you, but since when did the red Chinese start running it?
[1:43:54.000 --> 1:44:02.000]  Well, that's not the issue as much as the fact that nobody's going to movies and the millennials are now streaming all of the content.
[1:44:02.000 --> 1:44:04.000]  So let's not worry about Hollywood.
[1:44:04.000 --> 1:44:14.000]  What we have to worry about now is the fact that now, and let's get into the 400 million, I had the four horsemen in the apocalypse.
[1:44:14.000 --> 1:44:31.000]  Obama, Comey, Brennan, three horsemen go in and carry and give a ransom of $400 million part of a $1.7 billion ransom for four Americans held in Iran.
[1:44:31.000 --> 1:44:34.000]  You know how criminal that is? That's treason.
[1:44:34.000 --> 1:44:43.000]  If I had done that over the past 30 to 40 years as the head of counterterrorism and international hostage negotiation, I would have been in prison for that.
[1:44:43.000 --> 1:44:48.000]  And believe me, the FBI would be more than happy to hand me subpoenas.
[1:44:48.000 --> 1:45:01.000]  But when the head of the FBI, the head of the CIA, the president of the United States and John Kerry, pay ransom money basically to keep the Iranians quiet of $1.7 billion.
[1:45:01.000 --> 1:45:06.000]  Isn't like Roger Kipling said in that poem that once you pay the pirate, you must do it over and over again?
[1:45:06.000 --> 1:45:08.000]  Correct. You never stop.
[1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:13.000]  And the Iranians have continuously, they took two more hostages after that.
[1:45:13.000 --> 1:45:17.000]  And so once again, they're going through this action of paying off hostages.
[1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:21.000]  But everybody knows you don't pay off people. Why did they do it?
[1:45:21.000 --> 1:45:27.000]  Because they're cowardly and because they're inept. And I can't tell you how inept they really are.
[1:45:27.000 --> 1:45:34.000]  Comey has failed repeatedly. He failed to indict Hillary. He failed to really handle the FBI.
[1:45:34.000 --> 1:45:39.000]  What did you make of that? Speaking of schizophrenics, schizophrenic speech where he indicts her.
[1:45:39.000 --> 1:45:44.000]  She's horrible. She's lied. She's evil. But then no one will go after her. I mean, what did you make of his speech?
[1:45:44.000 --> 1:45:58.000]  Well, the point of the speech was that he made a very serious mistake when he had General Petraeus who had given over eight notebooks to his mistress and had committed a crime that was a felony.
[1:45:58.000 --> 1:46:07.000]  And then Petraeus on top of that lied. So what did Comey and at that time Eric Holder do? They made him a misdemeanor.
[1:46:07.000 --> 1:46:13.000]  As a result of that, he said that no efficient prosecutor can indict her.
[1:46:13.000 --> 1:46:21.000]  What he meant was that he messed up once again. Comey has to resign because he messed up not only once under Petraeus.
[1:46:21.000 --> 1:46:32.000]  He messed up again under Hillary Clinton. And you can't have an FBI that could not indict a woman like that because the issue that they had already messed up under Petraeus.
[1:46:32.000 --> 1:46:37.000]  So what we have is compounding mistakes again and again.
[1:46:37.000 --> 1:46:43.000]  All right, I hear you. Well, Dr. Steve Petrinick, simply amazing info. Anytime you want to come on, just call Nico. We'd love to get you on.
[1:46:43.000 --> 1:46:47.000]  Thank you for the opportunity and God bless your audience.
[1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:54.000]  Let me just say one more thing. You offered a couple of years ago to fly to Austin and to be in studio. I know your face hadn't been seen in forever.
[1:46:54.000 --> 1:47:01.000]  We could do like Drudge and have you over there in the corner blacked out. But I want to get you a plane ticket here in the next month or so if you want to do it.
[1:47:01.000 --> 1:47:07.000]  Come to Austin and check out the facility after us talking on air for 15 years. It's 15 now, Doc. Almost 17.
[1:47:07.000 --> 1:47:13.000]  I know. And we've had a good friendship. Let's keep it that way. Otherwise, you don't want to see my face.
[1:47:13.000 --> 1:47:17.000]  Okay. Well, before you said you wanted to come to Austin. Remember that?
[1:47:17.000 --> 1:47:23.000]  Well, yeah, a long time ago, but now I'm happy just being in the rural South and working with my people.
[1:47:23.000 --> 1:47:30.000]  But the truth of the matter is let's get the medical records out and the doctors on Fox News were absolutely correct.
[1:47:30.000 --> 1:47:35.000]  They're both excellent doctors. One works at Mount Sinai. The other one's a famous internist.
[1:47:35.000 --> 1:47:40.000]  And like them, I said, let's get the medical records and find out what this is all about.
[1:47:40.000 --> 1:47:43.000]  And I thank you, Alex, for the opportunity to talk.
[1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:47.000]  Thank you. Just in closing in 60 seconds, I think even the establishment steals this election,
[1:47:47.000 --> 1:47:51.000]  which they're trying to set up right now with fake bulls, that it's the end, though.
[1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:57.000]  I mean, they're really showing their cards. They've got a obviously collapsing, degenerating.
[1:47:57.000 --> 1:48:05.000]  It's very sad, rotting woman who they're foisting like a dead, dead king and up in a chair.
[1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:10.000]  And, you know, the El Cid trick worked for about 30 seconds, you know, where he rides out against the Moors.
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:16.000]  But in the real world, you can't have a corpse in the White House for too long, especially in the age of the Internet.
[1:48:16.000 --> 1:48:20.000]  And if the Secret Service and others think they can cover this up for a long time, I think they're wrong.
[1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:25.000]  What do you think all this craziness signifies, Dr. Steve Pachennick of StevePachennick.com?
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:33.000]  Well, we're on the process of a republic which has been led over 30 years by incompetent presidents
[1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:37.000]  of the United States who were not qualified, including Obama.
[1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:41.000]  I said it from the very beginning. He was a liar. He was a sociopath.
[1:48:41.000 --> 1:48:46.000]  He would lie all the way through the White House and couldn't care less.
[1:48:46.000 --> 1:48:50.000]  The same thing with Bush Jr. and the same thing with Bill Clinton.
[1:48:50.000 --> 1:48:56.000]  The only thing I'm not here to promote Trump, although I favor Trump for one simple reason.
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:49:01.000]  He's had a business experience. He's going to clean out whatever there is
[1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:05.000]  as to what his personality is. I could care less.
[1:49:05.000 --> 1:49:12.000]  Well, you're a board-certifying psychiatrist from Harvard and a former head of counterterrorism and a commando before that.
[1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:15.000]  So I think you're certified to tell us what you really think of Trump.
[1:49:15.000 --> 1:49:17.000]  What do you think of his psychology? Because I read these big psychology things.
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:27.000]  Like all of us, we're a bit narcissistic, but I think Trump has been able to advance despite the problems ahead of him.
[1:49:27.000 --> 1:49:33.000]  And he was courageous enough to go forth and said, look, I want to be president of the United States.
[1:49:33.000 --> 1:49:35.000]  He's the first businessman we've ever had.
[1:49:35.000 --> 1:49:39.000]  He's not out to get America. Do you agree with my analysis that he's not out to get us?
[1:49:39.000 --> 1:49:44.000]  No. If anything, I think he wants and he picked a very good man in Michael Pence.
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:50.000]  He wants to get forth and clean out the entire establishment that's totally corrupt,
[1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:57.000]  including the Clintons, the Republicans, the FBI, the CIA, the DNI, I mean, Michael Hayden.
[1:49:57.000 --> 1:50:02.000]  And then he wants to get in, clean it out, and he would be more than happy to give it over to Pence
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:05.000]  and to the people that he brings into the government.
[1:50:05.000 --> 1:50:09.000]  Well, you just showed the inside baseball truth is Trump doesn't want to do any of this.
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:12.000]  He just wants to fix it and get out and go play golf.
[1:50:12.000 --> 1:50:13.000]  That's exactly right.
[1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:15.000]  You know the inside baseball, don't you? Because that's the truth.
[1:50:15.000 --> 1:50:19.000]  Trump doesn't even want to be president. He just can't sit there and watch this happen.
[1:50:19.000 --> 1:50:24.000]  Because he's doing it simply because it's the mandate that he felt he needed to do and just clean it out.
[1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:28.000]  But he's correct. He read Hillary correctly. He read the problems correctly.
[1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:35.000]  He stated that we have a rigged election, Bernie, unfortunately, left and was overwhelmed and couldn't continue.
[1:50:35.000 --> 1:50:38.000]  Well, they're pretty freaked out because they know and it's not a secret.
[1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:42.000]  I mean, Trump's a listener, been a listener for a long time and they're really upset about it.
[1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:45.000]  Dr. Pachennick, thank you. StevePachennick.com, all your great books and material.
[1:50:45.000 --> 1:50:50.000]  Let's get you up for an hour soon about the great book about your mom just from a historical perspective.

[1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:40.000]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.

[1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:17.000]  I don't get up here and attack Hillary.
[1:54:17.000 --> 1:54:24.000]  As a dirty trick to say she's obviously completely ill, I mean, you can look at her, she looks like she's in bad shape.
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:29.000]  But for me, it's the bigger issue that her and Bill have been Communist-Chinese spies forever.
[1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:36.000]  You've heard it from Dr. Steve Pachennick, who was the former head of counterterrorism for the United States, for the U.S. Army, and more.
[1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:43.000]  And the entire structure that isn't Traders knows that this country is in so much trouble.
[1:54:43.000 --> 1:54:51.000]  I mean, it really is crazy. And now we've got this exercise of Hillary going and blaming the Second Amendment for what happened in Orlando.
[1:54:51.000 --> 1:54:58.000]  And there in the crowd, you've got the father, Sadeep Matan, of Omar Matan, who killed 50-plus people.
[1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:06.000]  And then he goes on the news and is arrogant and proud of it, and then Hillary spends it and says, oh, he wasn't invited when they were in the vetted group.
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:10.000]  Joe Biggs has covered many Hillary rallies. He's got the documentation, Joe Biggs.
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:15.000]  Yeah, so I want to go back to the mental state of Hillary Clinton really quick if we can.
[1:55:15.000 --> 1:55:25.000]  My grandmother died of Alzheimer's. My great-grandmother died of Alzheimer's and all started with falling down, forgetting who people were, twitching, things like that.
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:29.000]  So it definitely looks like she almost has an onset of Alzheimer's, in a sense.
[1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:31.000]  Like, there's definitely something going on.
[1:55:31.000 --> 1:55:33.000]  That's what Pachennick said, plus brain tumor.
[1:55:33.000 --> 1:55:35.000]  I mean, that's definitely a possibility.
[1:55:35.000 --> 1:55:43.000]  Now, with what happened in Orlando, she actually spoke at a rally in Kissimmee. I actually retweeted some video just a minute ago from this girl who was in Kissimmee at the rally.
[1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:49.000]  She's a Trump supporter. And what they actually did is they fudged the numbers. This is a room, a building that held about 3,000 people.
[1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:55.000]  They actually moved the walls in and tightened it up so it looked like there was a ton of people in there for when they filmed.
[1:55:55.000 --> 1:55:57.000]  And then in the back area was completely wide open.
[1:55:57.000 --> 1:56:06.000]  Yeah, the footage is up on your Rambo Biggs. It's also on our article that's on Drugsreport.com, infowars.com, breaking that down. It's crazy.
[1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:11.000]  But she can't even, in Omaha, she can't even fill up a rally. They had to bring in high school kids to fill it up.
[1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:17.000]  You know, there's multiple areas where no one's coming out, but they want to tell you that she's leading in the polls and more people are for her.
[1:56:17.000 --> 1:56:26.000]  When in fact, when you go to Trump rallies, there are thousands upon thousands of people and people mile long wrapped around the buildings to go hear this man speak, but no one is for her.
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:33.000]  How do they think they're going to pull this off? I mean, they admit they're adding 15% more Democrats to poll samples to give her a lead.
[1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:35.000]  It's pure bull. How dumb do they think we are?
[1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:39.000]  What was it? Pennsylvania? 60,000 people switched over from Democrat to Republican?
[1:56:39.000 --> 1:56:46.000]  Oh, it's a landslide and they're going to try to steal it. And I tell you, they got the new Fox News director for Ailes. He was on this morning.
[1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:53.000]  Oh, it's true. Hillary's going to win by 12 points, uses his real Nellie guy. And don't listen to others, these unhealthy polls.
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:58.000]  I mean, they are really, they had to take Fox down, though, so that they couldn't challenge it.
[1:56:58.000 --> 1:57:02.000]  Well, yeah, if you start watching Fox now, you start seeing, they're starting to lean more towards Clinton.
[1:57:02.000 --> 1:57:10.000]  Every time you hear these guys, except for Sean Hannity, like it's all like, by the way, I'm not going to get him in trouble, but he did reach out to us.
[1:57:10.000 --> 1:57:14.000]  He said, great job. We appreciate you. I'm trying my best. They're threatening to fire him right now.
[1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:17.000]  So he reached out to us and said he appreciates this.
[1:57:17.000 --> 1:57:25.000]  I just, this country's a deep crap, brother. They are cooling Fox News, but you got fake polls out. They got Fox this morning on three different shows.
[1:57:25.000 --> 1:57:29.000]  I watched him. Oh, he's always been behind Hillary. He's going to lose by 12 points. Yeah.
[1:57:29.000 --> 1:57:35.000]  But it's a top story. They go, well, David Duke endorsed Trump. And then he goes, well, I disavowed him. They're like, were you going to disavow me?
[1:57:35.000 --> 1:57:41.000]  He's like, well, I just did it. How many times do I have to do it? And then she brings out Khan to the DNC to speak.
[1:57:41.000 --> 1:57:44.000]  This guy says that Sharia law should be held over all other laws.
[1:57:44.000 --> 1:57:53.000]  He's just like Sadiq Matin. Yeah. And now you have Sadiq Matin, the father of Omar Matin, the Orlando Pulse nightclub killer.
[1:57:53.000 --> 1:57:59.000]  And they're saying, well, we didn't invite him. He wasn't asked to be here. Well, I've been to tons of these rallies before.
[1:57:59.000 --> 1:58:08.000]  When I'm able to come in this press, that row behind where the presidential candidate speaks is already full before they let in the main public who have been waiting to have tickets.
[1:58:08.000 --> 1:58:15.000]  That's admitted. It's always vetted trusted Democrat turds. Yeah. Now, if he was in the regular crowd standing up, then I could understand.
[1:58:15.000 --> 1:58:18.000]  You know, maybe he just, he got one of those regular emails and decided to show up.
[1:58:18.000 --> 1:58:27.000]  But he was standing behind a presidential front runner for the Democratic Party, right there smiling, waving, all happy and excited.
[1:58:27.000 --> 1:58:32.000]  This is who's in her corner. So what's the message? They're obviously doing this on purpose.
[1:58:32.000 --> 1:58:39.000]  This is like a message to people out there. Hey, bring anybody in. I want to talk about a statement when we get back that he made that I think is very important.
[1:58:39.000 --> 1:59:03.000]  If you're with us info wars dot com four slash show stations across the country, spread the word. Don't take this transmission for granted, folks.

[2:00:02.000 --> 2:00:17.000]  It's a long way from the info wars dot com studios. It's Alex Jones.
[2:00:17.000 --> 2:00:21.000]  It is a long way to the top of the fight against the globalist, but I'm telling you.
[2:00:21.000 --> 2:00:34.000]  The quote, Martin Luther King, I have seen the kingdom. I know where we're going in the animated contest of liberty and the collectivist, the globalist know we're struggling out of their grip.
[2:00:34.000 --> 2:00:47.000]  And they are pulling the stops out. Folks, if Trump was really behind in polls, I'd tell you if any of their BS was real, I'd say the public's pathetic. They're idiots like I did 10 years ago.
[2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:59.000]  What's wrong with you people? They're not. Trump gets 20,000. Sanders gets 20,000. Hillary gets 179. We can't find people at exit polls for Hillary and the primaries.
[2:00:59.000 --> 2:01:01.000]  They stole it. Joe Biggs is here with us.
[2:01:01.000 --> 2:01:16.000]  When I was in Long Beach, California, a bulk of the people that were waiting in line to go into Long Beach to that community college to hear Clinton speak were Trump supporters or Bernie supporters who just wanted to go hear her lie in person to see if it's really as bad as what they've seen in videos.
[2:01:16.000 --> 2:01:18.000]  Man does not look at the gorgon and live.
[2:01:18.000 --> 2:01:27.000]  I mean, most people aren't going out here because they really believe in what she's saying. They're doing it for the circus, the show to be like, all right, man, I hear a lie, but I want to see in person.
[2:01:27.000 --> 2:01:36.000]  Exactly. And then on those days, she gets 1,000. So what does this mean that they admit in different polls they're running every scam you can imagine, or they'll do a third independence.
[2:01:36.000 --> 2:01:44.000]  They don't just randomly call numbers. Who has landlines? Plus, they know who they're calling before they call. They'll have a third independence, a third Democrat, a third Republican.
[2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:54.000]  They'll poll them, but then all the independents are basically Democrats already, or they admit they sample 50% more Democrats. I mean, it's admitted fraud and the whole media just goes along like it's okay, Joe.
[2:01:54.000 --> 2:02:05.000]  It was complete and total fraud because I go to all these events. I can hardly find a Hillary Clinton supporter. At the DNC, for instance, the only Clinton supporters were inside really.
[2:02:05.000 --> 2:02:12.000]  Meanwhile, they're not even talking about the massive amount of chaos going on. The Sanders supporters that are upset that about having the nomination stole.
[2:02:12.000 --> 2:02:14.000]  If you are Hillary, start to attack you.
[2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:20.000]  Oh, they did. They did that to people. It's out of control. People do not like her.
[2:02:20.000 --> 2:02:23.000]  What do you think her real numbers are? I think it's like 10%.
[2:02:23.000 --> 2:02:31.000]  It's a big Psyop. You know, most people are going to watch the TV. They're going to look at it. They're going to believe it and take it as, you know, the 10 commandments.
[2:02:31.000 --> 2:02:37.000]  They're going to say, all right, well, Fox News said that this poll is this or CNN or Rachel Maddow came out and said that this is the poll number.
[2:02:37.000 --> 2:02:42.000]  It's a Psyop to make the regular person, the sheep that I'm with her to come out there and go.
[2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:48.000]  You know how pissed they are that Trump listens to the show? I mean, I'm not talking about me. It's dangerous. I'm not even.
[2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:53.000]  They are so freaked out. When I ran to Globalist at the RNC, they were just totally freaked.
[2:02:53.000 --> 2:02:58.000]  I mean, people are waking up. People are sick and tired of hearing this crap.
[2:02:58.000 --> 2:03:05.000]  You know, there's a lot of people I run into at all these events and they go around. They save up and they go to these events to talk to people and engage.
[2:03:05.000 --> 2:03:08.000]  And no one can find Hillary supporters when you go to them.
[2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:15.000]  We should do special reports like in search of Hillary supporters. We can find a few at UT, a few in the rich neighborhoods.
[2:03:15.000 --> 2:03:17.000]  I tell you, they're always so rich.
[2:03:17.000 --> 2:03:21.000]  Well, if you look at most of her rallies up until now, they've been private.
[2:03:21.000 --> 2:03:27.000]  She does them at rich people. Yeah, they do them at these billionaire houses. You have to spend like $20,000.
[2:03:27.000 --> 2:03:32.000]  They shake their finger at us when there's a bunch of blue collar folks who just want a better job saying we're elitists.
[2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:36.000]  $7,000 to be able to be given the address to the place.
[2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:44.000]  Then $15 or $15,000 to sit down at the table beside her or in the vicinity to be around her highness.
[2:03:44.000 --> 2:03:47.000]  And then $20,000 to ask her a question privately or something like that.
[2:03:47.000 --> 2:03:50.000]  A woman wearing a diaper. Yeah, she looks like a mouse.
[2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:56.000]  Nothing against diapers, but I mean, you know, I'm not normally for burgers, but I think she needs one.
[2:03:56.000 --> 2:04:00.000]  Have you seen the new thing with the Teletubby outfits the Muslim women are wearing?
[2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:04.000]  The Teletubby outfits. But those are big. These are like Teletubby outfits.
[2:04:04.000 --> 2:04:08.000]  Yeah, I saw that. The volleyball players. Yeah.
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:10.000]  Oh my God.
[2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:16.000]  Look, I get it. If you want to wear conservative clothes and do all that, that's what I like in my family.
[2:04:16.000 --> 2:04:21.000]  I tell my daughters, hey, don't dress like you're trying to get a job, you know, at the local strip club.
[2:04:21.000 --> 2:04:27.000]  But at the same time, like it's volleyball, like let the women be in bathing suits, you know.
[2:04:27.000 --> 2:04:31.000]  It was an interesting thing if we go back to this Kissimmee thing where we will.
[2:04:31.000 --> 2:04:34.000]  We got another guest coming on the right shotgun with us. Okay.
[2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:39.000]  Thanks for the rest of the hour. And then have a nice taking over and a lot more.
[2:04:39.000 --> 2:04:45.000]  Listen, here's the deal. I got to laugh and make jokes about this or I'm going to split my wrist.
[2:04:45.000 --> 2:04:49.000]  So I'm serious. I'm not going to actually commit suicide. Don't kill me. It's a figure of speech.
[2:04:49.000 --> 2:04:55.000]  The point is, is that I don't think this is funny, but I have to make it funny or I can't handle it.
[2:04:55.000 --> 2:04:59.000]  Exactly. It's just hilarious. We'll be back.
[2:05:25.000 --> 2:05:33.000]  Miss Leaves, readers with Hillary Clinton photo, CNN's Brian Settler writes that news aggregator Matt Drudge is taking a six month old photo out of context.
[2:05:33.000 --> 2:05:40.000]  Settler claims that the images merely show Hillary being aided after a slip and dismisses concerns about Hillary's health.
[2:05:40.000 --> 2:05:46.000]  In addition, the claims of John Cardio are not mentioned. Cardio told Breitbart about two different individuals,
[2:05:46.000 --> 2:05:53.000]  one a federal agent and another an NYPD officer who'd worked security at a Hillary event in New York City,
[2:05:53.000 --> 2:05:59.000]  both personally witnessed Hillary's walking difficulties. This has been Joe Biggs with infowars.com.
[2:06:24.000 --> 2:06:28.000]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[2:06:39.000 --> 2:06:44.000]  I haven't pulled an all nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brainforce.
[2:06:44.000 --> 2:06:54.000]  I woke up at 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brainforce and came in.
[2:07:14.000 --> 2:07:17.000]  Solar generators really do provide life saving electrical power.
[2:07:17.000 --> 2:07:24.000]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases and produce electricity from the sun.
[2:07:24.000 --> 2:07:31.000]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[2:07:31.000 --> 2:07:38.000]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week. Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators.
[2:07:38.000 --> 2:07:45.000]  And they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off the grid gear in addition to the low price for infowars listeners.
[2:07:45.000 --> 2:07:50.000]  So it's a good time to check it out. Go to gridwars.com. That's gridwars.com.
[2:07:50.000 --> 2:07:54.000]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[2:07:54.000 --> 2:08:09.000]  Go to gridwars.com. That's gridwars.com.
[2:08:24.000 --> 2:08:30.000]  We have a guest joining us who is at the border. I believe it's Lithuania going into Russia.
[2:08:30.000 --> 2:08:43.000]  There's a big convoy of Germans going into Russia in an attempt to draw attention to NATO and Merkel and the globalists moving tanks, weapons and nukes up to the border of Russia trying to start a new Cold War.
[2:08:43.000 --> 2:08:52.000]  We've got top mainline analysts here in the U.S. admitting that all of this is actually going on and unfolding as well.
[2:08:52.000 --> 2:09:00.000]  We should probably play that clip from one of the top Princeton professors from CNN from last week where he illustrates the fact that they're saying,
[2:09:00.000 --> 2:09:08.000]  Donald Trump is, you know, this communist agent. Russia's not even communist anymore because he doesn't want to have a war and wants to have detente.
[2:09:08.000 --> 2:09:11.000]  But Hillary does because she's so liberal, she's so cool.
[2:09:11.000 --> 2:09:14.000]  And Joe Biggs is obviously going to write shotgun with us the rest of the hour.
[2:09:14.000 --> 2:09:29.000]  After our guests leave us the bottom of the hour, we're going to burrow in to the father, Sadiq Mateen, of Omar Mateen, the gay nightclub pulse killer of more than 50 people who shows up in the VIP area of the Hillary event,
[2:09:29.000 --> 2:09:36.000]  gets behind her on the stage and then is on the local news. Joe is burrowing into this, researching this right now.
[2:09:36.000 --> 2:09:45.000]  Also at the same event and at other events, they make the crowd look much larger. A thousand to show up to see Hillary. It's 179 according to the Secret Service,
[2:09:45.000 --> 2:09:50.000]  but she's the rock star that's going to win the election.
[2:09:50.000 --> 2:10:09.000]  Now, Max Bachmann is an independent journalist. He has a TV program on a national German television. And of course, he's also done reporting for infowars.com from Bilderberg 2015, 2016 at generalist.org.
[2:10:09.000 --> 2:10:25.000]  And he joins us to tell us about this convoy, that I guess means friendship, the peace drive from Berlin to Moscow as a citizen's initiative to promote international friendship between Germany and Russia.
[2:10:25.000 --> 2:10:33.000]  The Germans and Russians killed about 20 million on each side World War II, 40 million plus dead. Well, yeah, it's good I didn't have another war.
[2:10:33.000 --> 2:10:49.000]  And they are involved in a convoy to draw attention to what's happening. The website is drushba.info. We'll get into the meaning of that word. Max, thanks for joining us.
[2:10:49.000 --> 2:10:58.000]  Again, he is on the border there. We tried this yesterday. I think it might be three times the charm.
[2:10:58.000 --> 2:11:09.000]  Let him go through the checkpoint and we'll get him on later. Twice is the try, but we've plugged it. We've done it. I'll try it one more time tomorrow and then we'll maybe cover some of their HD videos once they put them out.
[2:11:09.000 --> 2:11:19.000]  He did a great job reporting from Bilderberg for us, but rather internet issues. We're going to shut that down right now. It's the magic of Skype, but I tell you, out in the middle of nowhere, it just doesn't work too well.
[2:11:19.000 --> 2:11:32.000]  It would be nice if other folks from Europe joined the convoy. It's why we're doing it, to tell you about it today. So there it is. Joe Big, shifting gears now. Let's look at this father, the surrealness.
[2:11:32.000 --> 2:11:44.000]  Drudge Report called it the Twilight Zone. This Sadiq Mateen, the father of Omar Mateen, from the nightclub shooting, showing up. He has his own shows where he pushes the same garbage.
[2:11:44.000 --> 2:11:49.000]  It's all being protected. His dad's brought him out of the CIA. What is going on?
[2:11:49.000 --> 2:12:01.000]  Yeah, this guy is involved in a very large pro-Taliban movement. He spits out a lot of anti-homosexual rhetoric and stuff like that where he calls for the cleansing of these kind of people.
[2:12:01.000 --> 2:12:14.000]  And meanwhile, you have a presidential candidate in Hillary Clinton, who gets on stage and says she's for the LGBT, and she is taking money from Saudi Arabia. She's taking money from countries that murder them, throw them off buildings.
[2:12:14.000 --> 2:12:26.000]  And now you have this guy, the father of Omar Mateen, who killed over 49 people in Orlando, Florida at the Pulse nightclub. And this guy is in the vetted area standing behind her.
[2:12:26.000 --> 2:12:34.000]  That should piss off a lot of people. And it also sends a message to other people out there, hey, you want to go out and shoot some people up? Come on into the Democratic Party.
[2:12:34.000 --> 2:12:47.000]  Now, the local WPTV news actually stopped and talked to Sadiq and asked him a few questions. He said, I've been cooperating with the federal government, and that's about it. Thank you.
[2:12:47.000 --> 2:12:58.000]  By the way, the footage of him behind Hillary is priceless from the newscast for TV viewers who can roll some of that behind to just see him smiling behind her. This does smell like sigh. What do you think is going on?
[2:12:58.000 --> 2:13:10.000]  Yeah, definitely. He says Hillary Clinton is good for the U.S. versus Donald Trump, who has no solutions. Now, the news crew ran into her a few miles down the road and was actually able to stop and interview him.
[2:13:10.000 --> 2:13:19.000]  So I don't know what happened in between the time that he didn't want to really give a statement into the miles down the road when this crew ran into him again accidentally at this rest stop.
[2:13:19.000 --> 2:13:29.000]  He then comes out and makes a statement that I think is very interesting. He says, it's the Democratic Party anyone can join. That's a statement he's making.
[2:13:29.000 --> 2:13:35.000]  He's looking at all those people. Hey, you want to come out here? You want to come out here? Because my son did this. My son carried out my wishes.
[2:13:35.000 --> 2:13:43.000]  You guys want to come out here? Guess what? The Democratic Party is going to be one that's going to allow you to come into this country. And the Democratic Party is allowing these borders to be wide open.
[2:13:43.000 --> 2:13:45.000]  That's the message worldwide. He's conducting a jihad.
[2:13:45.000 --> 2:13:56.000]  Yes. He's saying to all those people out there, those pro Taliban supporters, those ISIS sympathizers, hey man, you want to come to America? Come in, vote Democrat. Let's get Hillary Clinton in. We'll be able to have fun.
[2:13:56.000 --> 2:14:03.000]  And then they also want to push this whole gun control thing. Why would they want to push gun control? Why? Because gun free zones are kill zones.
[2:14:03.000 --> 2:14:06.000]  They take the guns away. Then there's psychotic jihadi.
[2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:17.000]  They have a literal, just like Khan pushes this Muslim law firm, Muslim journal to turn us over to Syria law. And the weird leftist cover for it all.
[2:14:17.000 --> 2:14:21.000]  Yeah, exactly. He's able to sit here and go, what? Let's bring these people in. It's okay. Let's do this.
[2:14:21.000 --> 2:14:26.000]  But then you want to come out and say, oh, you want to make fun of gold star families or whatever like that. If you notice the wife didn't say anything.
[2:14:26.000 --> 2:14:34.000]  Maybe it's because they're actually practicing sharia law at home. Maybe Mr. Khan doesn't allow his wife to speak in public unless he speaks to him.
[2:14:34.000 --> 2:14:38.000]  And by the way, we have a clip where Saudi Arabia on record is Hillary's biggest donor. Here it is.
[2:14:38.000 --> 2:14:42.000]  What is the connection with you, Hillary Clinton, Saudi Arabia that certainly got Israel?
[2:14:42.000 --> 2:14:56.000]  It's extensive. I mean, the relationships between Hillary Clinton and Saudi Arabia, between the Clinton Foundation and Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabia is probably the largest single donor to the Clinton Foundation.
[2:14:56.000 --> 2:15:14.000]  And you can see Clinton's arms export policies why she was Secretary of State, favoring extensively Saudi Arabia.
[2:15:14.000 --> 2:15:26.000]  Yeah, I mean, she's a communist Chinese agent slash Saudi Arabia agent. And folks, I criticized Israel when they're doing stuff that's wrong because, you know, Israel is a complex government. It's got bad people as well.
[2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:33.000]  But this thing that Israel makes the weather the way it is, and if you've fallen a banana peel, Israel did it. No, I look at what who really runs it.
[2:15:33.000 --> 2:15:39.000]  And man, I'm telling, and I'll say this, the Israel lobby has really rolled over to communist China. So, you know, bad on them for that.
[2:15:39.000 --> 2:15:46.000]  But Saudi Arabia, it is China. They've got so much money. They are just pumping it in. They are doing whatever they want.
[2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:52.000]  And I'm wondering, Joe Beggs, what is the bigger picture here? Why are they doing this? Where are they wanting to go?
[2:15:52.000 --> 2:15:57.000]  I mean, the reason they can get away with it is because most people are scared to even go up against the Clintons.
[2:15:57.000 --> 2:16:02.000]  Think about since the DNC, Clinton body counter left wing conspiracy, three with ties to DNC.
[2:16:02.000 --> 2:16:08.000]  That's right, three top DNC people over the delegates dead. And they're all being found shot in the head.
[2:16:08.000 --> 2:16:15.000]  The DNC committee emails were leaked a few weeks ago. Three people associated with the DNC have all been found dead under what could be questionable circumstances.
[2:16:15.000 --> 2:16:19.000]  Some including Bernie Sanders supporters suspect that Clintons were behind the deaths.
[2:16:19.000 --> 2:16:24.000]  Now, I know people, many of us that were out there, the DNC actually talked to these Sanders supporters.
[2:16:24.000 --> 2:16:27.000]  And they think that the reason the Sanders stood down is because he was threatened.
[2:16:27.000 --> 2:16:28.000]  Well, no kidding.
[2:16:28.000 --> 2:16:33.000]  You look at FBI director James Comey coming out and all of a sudden listing out all these reasons.
[2:16:33.000 --> 2:16:38.000]  Why should she be indicted? Why should she be thrown in jail? And he goes, well, no one's going to take that case.
[2:16:38.000 --> 2:16:41.000]  You know, and then you have this guy right here, Seth Rich, DNC staffer.
[2:16:41.000 --> 2:16:45.000]  Seth Rich was mysteriously murdered in the streets of Washington, DC on July 10th.
[2:16:45.000 --> 2:16:50.000]  Although it was being investigated as a robbery, his wallet, credit cards and watch were not taken.
[2:16:50.000 --> 2:16:56.000]  The 20 year old was walking back home from his girlfriend's apartment and was found shot in the back.
[2:16:56.000 --> 2:17:01.000]  Well, he had the head of the DNC's outreach program, who was over delegates being found dead.
[2:17:01.000 --> 2:17:03.000]  He'd spoken out for Sanders.
[2:17:03.000 --> 2:17:09.000]  Well, this guy, they believe is the guy who actually leaked the 20,000 emails to WikiLeaks.
[2:17:09.000 --> 2:17:14.000]  They think that this guy, he was an intel analyst, a data analyst, and he was the one responsible.
[2:17:14.000 --> 2:17:19.000]  Because if you actually go back and look at the video with Julian Assange, he says that he did not get it from any kind of Russian hackers.
[2:17:19.000 --> 2:17:20.000]  Did not come from...
[2:17:20.000 --> 2:17:24.000]  Well, sure, the Russians have hacked some stuff, but they blame them for everything.
[2:17:24.000 --> 2:17:28.000]  What about conscientious people inside the system that see the corruption?
[2:17:28.000 --> 2:17:32.000]  Assange has talked about the next group of emails will get Hillary indicted.
[2:17:32.000 --> 2:17:36.000]  Why isn't he releasing them quicker?
[2:17:36.000 --> 2:17:44.000]  Even James Woods has said, what's the line on Vegas for the chances of Julian Assange living until November 8th?
[2:17:44.000 --> 2:17:46.000]  It's not going to look very good.
[2:17:46.000 --> 2:17:51.000]  If this comes out and it's actually as bad as he's saying, or as bad as he's building it up, there's something definitely going to happen.
[2:17:51.000 --> 2:17:55.000]  And he's been holed up in that Ecuadorian embassy for how long now?
[2:17:55.000 --> 2:17:57.000]  I mean, it's been years now.
[2:17:57.000 --> 2:18:01.000]  Exactly. We have a mysterious DNC desk club. Let's play that.
[2:18:01.000 --> 2:18:10.000]  And another man connected to the DNC has been found dead less than a month after the murder of DNC staffer Seth Conrad Rich.
[2:18:10.000 --> 2:18:18.000]  One America's Rachel Roboto tells us more about the mysterious death surrounding Sean Lucas and his involvement with the party's email scandal.
[2:18:18.000 --> 2:18:27.000]  It was a celebratory day for Sean Lucas when he entered the DNC building last month and told a committee official, you've been served.
[2:18:27.000 --> 2:18:31.000]  Lucas worked as a process server for the class action DNC lawsuit.
[2:18:31.000 --> 2:18:39.000]  The lawsuit was filed against both the committee and former DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz for allegedly committing acts of fraud.
[2:18:39.000 --> 2:18:45.000]  After leaked emails revealed the DNC showed favoritism towards Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders.
[2:18:45.000 --> 2:18:54.000]  After serving the papers, Lucas told an independent filmmaker who captured the whole thing on video that although Schultz refused to meet with him, democracy was served.
[2:18:54.000 --> 2:19:05.000]  Yeah, they wouldn't give us any of the head honchos, which I kind of had a feeling wasn't going to happen, but we did make contact with somebody from the Democratic National Committee's office and they've been served.
[2:19:05.000 --> 2:19:08.000]  Democracy has prevailed today.
[2:19:08.000 --> 2:19:16.000]  In a bizarre twist of events on August 2nd, less than one month after serving the subpoena, Lucas was reported dead.
[2:19:16.000 --> 2:19:25.000]  According to police records, Lucas's girlfriend found him lying on the floor unresponsive when she returned home that evening and immediately called 911.
[2:19:25.000 --> 2:19:29.000]  Paramedics said there was no sign of life by the time they arrived on the scene.
[2:19:29.000 --> 2:19:36.000]  Police are not releasing the cause of death at this time and are not commenting on speculation that Lucas was murdered.
[2:19:36.000 --> 2:19:42.000]  His unusual and sudden death is fueling speculation about the recent death of Seth Conrad Rich.
[2:19:42.000 --> 2:19:50.000]  Rich, a DNC employee, was working on several committee cases involving voter and election fraud before he was murdered by gunshots.
[2:19:50.000 --> 2:19:56.000]  He was also set to testify in the FBI's email investigation of Hillary Clinton before he was killed.
[2:19:56.000 --> 2:20:07.000]  Authorities have ruled his death as a robbery gone wrong, but police records indicate nothing was stolen from Rich, even though he had a cell phone, cash and a watch on him at the time of the incident.
[2:20:07.000 --> 2:20:13.000]  No suspects have been arrested and police are now offering a reward to anyone who knows more information.
[2:20:13.000 --> 2:20:18.000]  Now there's been another death. That's one American news doing a great job, Joe Biggs.
[2:20:18.000 --> 2:20:26.000]  Now there's another guy, John Ash, the former president of the United Nations General Assembly. This is the guy that was found that had died and had a barbell dropped on his head.
[2:20:26.000 --> 2:20:35.000]  But the interesting thing about it, the UN actually released a statement saying that he had died from a heart attack and then it came out that they had found him with his barbell dropped on his head.
[2:20:35.000 --> 2:20:45.000]  He was a 61-year-old man. He was about to testify against Chinese real estate developer, NG Lapsing, who was implicated in the China Gate scandal for funding money.
[2:20:45.000 --> 2:20:49.000]  Oh yeah, the Chinese funding Hillary again. Oh, he's dead.
[2:20:49.000 --> 2:20:56.000]  So I mean, there's the Clinton body count and actually, Darryl McBreen, I know he's working on a report for tomorrow. He's doing a big thing on the body count.
[2:20:56.000 --> 2:21:00.000]  It's building up and it's getting to a point where you're starting to see people are dead.
[2:21:00.000 --> 2:21:03.000]  Now there's never been dead bodies around the Clintons.
[2:21:03.000 --> 2:21:11.000]  I mean, have you heard about this? Two of the family members of the two of the guys that died in Benghazi have now sued Hillary Clinton for that.
[2:21:11.000 --> 2:21:16.000]  Let's talk about that in a moment. I'm going to stop right now because I didn't even plug last hour.
[2:21:16.000 --> 2:21:22.000]  We're not going to be here if I don't stop not airing the ads. I'm skipping one right now. I can't even help it.
[2:21:22.000 --> 2:21:28.000]  So it's kind of like schizophrenic deal where I just don't even want to have advertising. I don't want to mess with it, but I got to have it.
[2:21:28.000 --> 2:21:40.000]  And so we go out, we get the very best products we can at the very lowest prices, things that everybody needs, like water filtration systems, non-GMO seeds, incredible supplements, books, films.

[2:21:59.000 --> 2:22:02.000]  It's like SuperMail Vitality has some different ingredients, but some of the same.
[2:22:02.000 --> 2:22:07.000]  SuperMail is even stronger, but this is less, but the two go together well. It's kind of a base for that.

[2:24:40.000 --> 2:24:48.000]  We're here just saying we got great products at really great prices and we're crazy enough to go head up against Hillary and the globalists and the communist Chinese and Saudi Arabians.
[2:24:48.000 --> 2:24:56.000]  But look, don't thank me if they do something to us. I'm not bending over to these people. I'm never joining them. I'm not scum.
[2:24:56.000 --> 2:25:01.000]  Okay, I don't support killing Buddhist and putting them in mobile execution vans and harvesting their organs.
[2:25:01.000 --> 2:25:06.000]  So people think it's heroic to fight this. It's insane not to.
[2:25:06.000 --> 2:25:15.000]  Joe Beggs, let's get more into this weirdo shooter father from the Gay Night Club, the Pulse Club in Orlando showing up at the Stage Hillary event.
[2:25:15.000 --> 2:25:21.000]  He's there in the VIP area. He gives a press interview. This is unreal. What do you think is behind this?
[2:25:21.000 --> 2:25:31.000]  I mean, he is definitely sending out a message and they're allowing him to send out this message that, hey, if you want to come here, you vote Democrat, you can come here.
[2:25:31.000 --> 2:25:38.000]  Borders are going to be wide open. And then you have these guys pushing this gun control narrative where they want to have less guns.
[2:25:38.000 --> 2:25:42.000]  Look at California. Look at Chicago. Look at Chicago where there's so many people.
[2:25:42.000 --> 2:25:47.000]  You're saying the Jihad's on. We're going to come here. We're going to kill people. My son's going to kill people.
[2:25:47.000 --> 2:25:52.000]  And then we're going to take the slaves guns. We're going to take the Demi's guns.
[2:25:52.000 --> 2:25:57.000]  Exactly. I mean, people need to wake up and see this is scary. It's getting to a point.
[2:25:57.000 --> 2:26:06.000]  Now, look at this. Monday, Sadiq posted a video. Sadiq Mateen says his son was well educated and respectful to his parents and that he was not aware what motivated him.
[2:26:06.000 --> 2:26:12.000]  Meanwhile, Sadiq has put out many videos saying that homosexuality is bad and these people should be killed.
[2:26:12.000 --> 2:26:14.000]  Then it adds, God will put it out.
[2:26:14.000 --> 2:26:19.000]  His dad was saying the exact same crap his loon son was doing. You said it.
[2:26:19.000 --> 2:26:22.000]  It's just like in movies where they say they're sending out codes or whatever. It's not even coded.
[2:26:22.000 --> 2:26:27.000]  He's there saying, I'm here behind Hillary. I'm accepted. Come here. Do this. We will take their guns.
[2:26:27.000 --> 2:26:41.000]  My dad sent me a text message earlier saying, hey, go look at Demi contracts from over 11 Islamic countries where Christians and others have to sign a contract to pay 50% tax, not 10% be slaves.
[2:26:41.000 --> 2:26:46.000]  Excuse me. I'm sorry. Really bad allergies right now. Teleprompter free folks. I'm not like Hillary, but I am sneezing.
[2:26:46.000 --> 2:26:53.000]  And I'm like, dad, you print me the Demi contracts, but you fought this. Bracken talks about this. Explain what a Demi contract is.
[2:26:53.000 --> 2:27:02.000]  Well, look at this. So with Bo Bergdahl, what do we do with Bo Bergdahl? We release the Taliban five, which means we are negotiating with terrorists.
[2:27:02.000 --> 2:27:09.000]  Now we have this money that we have given to Iran. We're sending out a message in so many ways. It's all right for you to come here.
[2:27:09.000 --> 2:27:15.000]  It's all right for you to jihad here. And if you get caught or if something happens, hey, it's going to be all right.
[2:27:15.000 --> 2:27:23.000]  We're going to trade our people up for you guys to come here and be comfortable. That's the big issue is we're all about making these people feel comfortable here.
[2:27:23.000 --> 2:27:29.000]  Meanwhile, we can't even live in our own country peacefully. We can't be here happy. We can't even have our own culture.
[2:27:29.000 --> 2:27:40.000]  There's people within America, women who can go out and walk around wearing their clothing and be spit on and mocked at by these Muslim men who don't like the way they do it.
[2:27:40.000 --> 2:27:46.000]  But meanwhile, if we go to another country and don't abide by their culture, their rules, we're going to be looked down upon.
[2:27:46.000 --> 2:27:51.000]  But we're told that they can come here and do whatever they want. It's all going to be free.
[2:27:51.000 --> 2:27:56.000]  Meanwhile, there's veterans who are homeless, who are dying, who are getting the health care they need.
[2:27:56.000 --> 2:28:04.000]  But we're going to bring all these illegals over and allow them to have whatever they want, give them a court date four years down the road and never see them again.
[2:28:04.000 --> 2:28:10.000]  And we're run by foreign enemies. There's no doubt. DrudgeReport.com is top linked our story.
[2:28:10.000 --> 2:28:17.000]  When will Hillary disavow Omar Mateen's father, the man who supports Taliban, an extermination of gays, shows up at Clinton Rowley?
[2:28:17.000 --> 2:28:20.000]  And I would just add, Paul, and it's put in VIP section.
[2:28:20.000 --> 2:28:22.000]  Yeah, he's put in VIP section.
[2:28:22.000 --> 2:28:31.000]  When you go to these events, when you get your press pass, your credentials, when you walk into that facility, you will already see those bleachers behind that candidate that will come up and speak already full.
[2:28:31.000 --> 2:28:37.000]  The other people will start to funnel in on the outskirts, and that'll be your rally.
[2:28:37.000 --> 2:28:45.000]  Those people already pre-picked, predetermined, they're usually local Democrats, people who give money to the Hillary Foundation or Bernie or whoever that's going to be speaking there.
[2:28:45.000 --> 2:28:49.000]  Those people are given the right to bring them plus two or three other people to come in and sit there.
[2:28:49.000 --> 2:28:54.000]  And this guy sitting here saying, oh, I just got an email and the Clinton campaign coming out.
[2:28:54.000 --> 2:28:57.000]  We didn't invite him. It's complete and total BS.
[2:28:57.000 --> 2:29:00.000]  And listen, they stuck him there. They tell you where to stand at those.
[2:29:00.000 --> 2:29:02.000]  They stuck him there on purpose.
[2:29:02.000 --> 2:29:07.000]  So what is the Psyop? Is it Hillary just literally rubbing an end? We'll do whatever we want?
[2:29:07.000 --> 2:29:10.000]  I mean, she wears these Maoist uniforms, and now she's sitting here already with Mao.
[2:29:10.000 --> 2:29:12.000]  Yeah, she wears Mao outfits.
[2:29:12.000 --> 2:29:17.000]  And now she has Khan coming up and speaking, a guy who wants Sharia law over our law.
[2:29:17.000 --> 2:29:19.000]  He founded a law group to enforce it in America.
[2:29:19.000 --> 2:29:24.000]  Yes. And then we have people like Fatala Gelin that we allow to come in.
[2:29:24.000 --> 2:29:27.000]  The CIA gives a backdoor key to to come in.
[2:29:27.000 --> 2:29:29.000]  He's got $150 million.
[2:29:29.000 --> 2:29:33.000]  I mean, this is what our country's doing. They're telling these people, hey, Sharia law, that's fine.
[2:29:33.000 --> 2:29:38.000]  Patriotism, Second Amendment, First Amendment, that's bad. We don't want that here.
[2:29:41.000 --> 2:29:45.000]  I can't believe anymore. Stay there. We're going to be right back and take some phone calls with Joe Biggs.
[2:29:45.000 --> 2:29:49.000]  I'm Alex Jones in FullWars.com. Please don't take the show for granted. We're under attack.
[2:29:49.000 --> 2:29:53.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[2:29:53.000 --> 2:30:00.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:23.000 --> 2:30:30.000]  Here are some examples from the editorial produced as part of that coverage by the team.
[2:30:53.000 --> 2:30:56.000]  The party also gave a big thumbs up to Clinton's running mate, Tim Kaine.

[2:53:53.000 --> 2:53:58.000]  The Worldwide Leader in Mobile Radiation Shielding.
[2:54:24.000 --> 2:54:27.000]  Yes, good afternoon gentlemen.
[2:54:27.000 --> 2:54:35.000]  I've been an average listener of your show for quite a while and I'm very well aware of what the New World Order is doing to us.
[2:54:35.000 --> 2:54:39.000]  I'm an inventor, I kind of think out of the box on occasion.
[2:54:39.000 --> 2:54:55.000]  And the thought occurred to me that this government continuity of government program that has been in effect for years might present a possible means for the New World Order to decapitate our entire government in one fell swoop.
[2:54:55.000 --> 2:55:11.000]  Sure, it's set up for outside globalists to have a total track into everything to be able to bring down our nation anytime they want. That's actually the secret of world government is that they then hold the technotronic technocracy keys above it and can take down any country they want whenever they want.
[2:55:11.000 --> 2:55:16.000]  So you've hit the nail on the head there. It's kind of like Operation Valkyrie in reverse.
[2:55:16.000 --> 2:55:38.000]  If they stage a false attack or if there's some sort of a major emergency where they can get all of the members of Congress into these underground facilities, these facilities are already set up with air ventilation and it would be relatively simple for them to just nerve gas everybody in one fell swoop and decapitate the entire government.
[2:55:38.000 --> 2:55:47.000]  And also, if members of the military are ordered to go into these facilities at the same time, they would do that. Yeah, that's who you got to worry about is the Patriots.
[2:55:47.000 --> 2:55:58.000]  Listen, Warren Buffett called top billionaires the week before 9-11 and said, it's all expenses paid. It's secret. I can't tell you. You need to fly into Omaha on this night.
[2:55:58.000 --> 2:56:09.000]  And they were off at Air Force Base in the morning with big screen TVs. It's all secret what happened as the towers were hit. And a few that have leaked it said they were called their quote for their safety.
[2:56:09.000 --> 2:56:14.000]  Can you believe that? So yeah, it's amazing, man. They know what they're doing.
[2:56:14.000 --> 2:56:23.000]  Buddy, such a nice old man. He loves Obama, though. That's an interesting point, Hans. Anything else?
[2:56:23.000 --> 2:56:40.000]  Yeah. Go ahead. Hello? Yes, sir. Yeah. If you remember that movie where he gets all the crime bosses into this one facility of his and he nerve gasses them and takes all their money, this is something similar to what they're going to do to our members of Congress.
[2:56:40.000 --> 2:56:52.000]  And these people better realize that they think they've earned a seat at the table, but in reality, they're just dooming themselves. Once they enter these facilities, I don't think they'll be coming out of them again.
[2:56:52.000 --> 2:57:01.000]  Yeah, you're talking about the old goldfinger. Written by Ian Fleming, MI6. Let me expand on that. And I appreciate your call.
[2:57:01.000 --> 2:57:16.000]  That's kind of an allegory for what happens under any totalitarian system throughout the ages, that the people that help overthrow the free state, they then are the first people killed by the actual controllers that brought them in.
[2:57:16.000 --> 2:57:25.000]  So yes, the dumbest people are the ones that go along with the takeover. A lot of times they'll flip it back to a more populist movement, the elite will, because that's more stable.
[2:57:25.000 --> 2:57:33.000]  Once they've taken out the elite, a lot of times the takeover isn't even about robbing the general public. You just hit it. It's about knocking out the political class.
[2:57:33.000 --> 2:57:48.000]  Joe? Yeah, I agree completely. Like I said, we've pusified these people so much, the left are crying, they want to bring in these radical jihadis, but who do they think are going to be the first ones to take them out? It's going to be the guys that they're fighting for.
[2:57:48.000 --> 2:57:54.000]  Hopping and posting others over and over again, say it, wear a burqa, cover your face, make the muscles feel good, plus it's sexy.
[2:57:54.000 --> 2:58:03.000]  And now you have Obama coming out. He did this interview on the golf channel the other day where he goes, well, I'm not, he's like, I really don't want to get out. I'm being forced out. And he was joked many times about how...
[2:58:03.000 --> 2:58:08.000]  Yeah, by the way, you guys cue that up. It's only like a 30-second clip. He's on there with that FOP guy and they go, yeah, go ahead.
[2:58:08.000 --> 2:58:11.000]  Oh, we have it here. Let's play the FOP clip right now. Here it is.
[2:58:11.000 --> 2:58:26.000]  Have you taken any divots out of the south lawn here? The rest is a little thick here. I don't practice that much. You know, I'm a... I'm not a hack, but I'm not quitting my day job. I'd say...
[2:58:26.000 --> 2:58:36.000]  Actually, you are quitting your day job fairly shortly. Well, then I may get good. I'm being forced out. I didn't quit. I'd say...
[2:58:36.000 --> 2:58:49.000]  Ah, that's good. And again, I'm not against. This guy's a dandy. You know, in an interview with George Herbert Walker-Busch and W&W in the last interview with that guy, he's literally wearing a dandy outfit. We'll be right back.
[2:59:06.000 --> 2:59:11.000]  And the best part? You'll be helping your friends and family along the way.
[2:59:36.000 --> 2:59:56.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:07.000 --> 3:00:14.000]  Rallying Patriots worldwide. It's Joe Biggs in the InfoWars.com studio.
[3:00:14.000 --> 3:00:26.000]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:26.000 --> 3:00:46.000]  You know how my psychology works? I know Fox News has been controlled opposition forever. The control of libertarian movement. But to know they had a coup, to know they've come in, to know they had this suit planned for years, right before the election, because they can't have Fox challenging a stolen election, really is a bellwether.
[3:00:46.000 --> 3:00:58.000]  It's a canary in the coal mine. It is the biggest canary in the coal mine. And I really haven't even been covering it, because it's almost like I'm celebrating over a dead corpse. Not that it was perfect.
[3:00:58.000 --> 3:01:13.000]  But I really should be, because I'm watching it. It's definitely gone, you know, Hillary now. And you can see them putting the disinfo out. And it's almost like I'd be celebrating over a dead corpse if I attack it, but I have to.
[3:01:13.000 --> 3:01:25.000]  It's crazy. It's absolutely crazy that they really did it. And let me tell you, Drudge and InfoWars is next. Speaking of Drudge, I'm told us now the top story on Drudge. We'll put that on screen.
[3:01:25.000 --> 3:01:39.000]  Twilight Zone, Orlando Terrace, Dad, Cheers, Clinton, Will Hillary disavow. And that's our story. So again, that's just common sense. We put it out. Drudge links to it. Now it'll be a major talking point. If you get the story out to everyone, you know.
[3:01:39.000 --> 3:01:53.000]  And yet they hammered Trump nonstop about David Duke. There should be people, media, do your job. There should be people out there right now on every channel going, wow, Sadiq Mateen was back there in Orlando.
[3:01:53.000 --> 3:02:00.000]  Give me a break. The Cooklois Klan is completely Democrat. Every grand dragon there ever was was a Democrat.
[3:02:00.000 --> 3:02:02.000]  Well, it was Robert Byrd.
[3:02:02.000 --> 3:02:13.000]  And quite frankly, David Duke is right about, we can't just have wide open borders and that there's an anti-white agenda of balkanization. It doesn't mean he's right about white sheets and dancing around in a KKK outfit.
[3:02:13.000 --> 3:02:21.000]  Mecha and Lorazza are right about the exploitation of Hispanics in many cases. It doesn't mean they're right about, you know, all their crap. I mean, look.
[3:02:21.000 --> 3:02:33.000]  I agree with being intellectually honest. Okay. You know, I mean, the Imperial Japanese, I didn't agree with them doing secret testing on our trips. But yes, we did cut off their oil. We did cut off their rubber.
[3:02:33.000 --> 3:02:41.000]  The West did push them into that. Does that mean I agree with what the Japanese did? No. It's just it's reality based, Joe.
[3:02:41.000 --> 3:02:55.000]  I mean, look at all the media now. Now that Fox has completely gone Clinton, mostly, you've only got Info Wars, Breitbart and Michael Savage, who are the only the other people who are giving you that other side.
[3:02:55.000 --> 3:02:56.000]  And by the way, what's going on?
[3:02:56.000 --> 3:02:59.000]  We shut around here. Are we excited about there's so few of us?
[3:02:59.000 --> 3:03:06.000]  No, it's kind of, I mean, it's good that we have the people, but it's kind of sad sometimes.
[3:03:06.000 --> 3:03:07.000]  No, exactly. It's not fun.
[3:03:07.000 --> 3:03:09.000]  A lot of people out there that are on that side.
[3:03:09.000 --> 3:03:11.000]  It's creepy. It's creepy.
[3:03:11.000 --> 3:03:16.000]  Yeah, it's like we're all alone in this one big like Clinton rally, and we're the only ones there.
[3:03:16.000 --> 3:03:20.000]  Because there's no one showing up to the rally. It's like a total hoax where they're calling.
[3:03:20.000 --> 3:03:21.000]  We're just there.
[3:03:21.000 --> 3:03:22.000]  They're shutting the media down.
[3:03:22.000 --> 3:03:24.000]  We're just there bullhorning her and she's just sitting there going.
[3:03:24.000 --> 3:03:32.000]  Well, my point is, is I'm not in competition against Drudge. I'm not in competition against Breitbart. I'm not in competition against Roland Daly or Daily Caller.
[3:03:32.000 --> 3:03:36.000]  I mean, and none of us are perfect, but at least we don't want to destroy the country.
[3:03:36.000 --> 3:03:42.000]  And then I find the real Hillary supporters and Joe, it's like they're not home.
[3:03:42.000 --> 3:03:44.000]  Oh, yeah, I like Hillary Clinton.
[3:03:44.000 --> 3:03:50.000]  It's like the one guy that Rob talked to out there in Philadelphia, the guy was out of his mind.
[3:03:50.000 --> 3:03:52.000]  The other guy goes, yeah, take the gun.
[3:03:52.000 --> 3:03:54.000]  Sweep them up. Get rid of them.
[3:03:54.000 --> 3:03:56.000]  Hey, what did you think about?
[3:03:56.000 --> 3:03:57.000]  What did you think about?
[3:03:57.000 --> 3:04:00.000]  It's a daily show or one of these things to Eric Andre?
[3:04:00.000 --> 3:04:08.000]  No, that one, but somebody else said a clip where they go out and they ask questions, but say they quote Trump, but say it was Hillary and they all agree with it.
[3:04:08.000 --> 3:04:09.000]  Yeah.
[3:04:09.000 --> 3:04:10.000]  That's the thing we found.
[3:04:10.000 --> 3:04:12.000]  You can say we want to put babies in blenders or Hillary.
[3:04:12.000 --> 3:04:13.000]  They'd say yes.
[3:04:13.000 --> 3:04:16.000]  Of course.
[3:04:16.000 --> 3:04:17.000]  It was Jimmy Kimmel.
[3:04:17.000 --> 3:04:18.000]  In fact, we have that clip.
[3:04:18.000 --> 3:04:19.000]  We got to play that.
[3:04:19.000 --> 3:04:20.000]  Is David Knight coming in this studio?
[3:04:20.000 --> 3:04:23.000]  The other one.
[3:04:23.000 --> 3:04:24.000]  So he's being the other one.
[3:04:24.000 --> 3:04:29.000]  Well, that means we can come back and play the Jimmy Kimmel clip and in fact, we have it right now.
[3:04:29.000 --> 3:04:33.000]  We're going to come back and play that after the break and David Knight is going to be taking over.
[3:04:33.000 --> 3:04:35.000]  We have loaded phone lines.
[3:04:35.000 --> 3:04:37.000]  That will be up to David Knight.
[3:04:37.000 --> 3:04:38.000]  These are some good callers.
[3:04:38.000 --> 3:04:42.000]  They have been holding long if he wants to take those phone calls.
[3:04:42.000 --> 3:04:44.000]  But I shouldn't be laughing about all this.
[3:04:44.000 --> 3:04:45.000]  It's either that or cry.
[3:04:45.000 --> 3:04:46.000]  It looks like in combat.
[3:04:46.000 --> 3:04:48.000]  You have to learn to laugh at some of this stuff.
[3:04:48.000 --> 3:04:51.000]  If not, you're going to go crazy.
[3:04:51.000 --> 3:04:53.000]  I had to go nuts or I'd go crazy.
[3:04:53.000 --> 3:04:55.000]  Hillary Clinton's already going nuts.
[3:04:55.000 --> 3:04:58.000]  Oh, man, I can't look at her anymore.
[3:04:58.000 --> 3:04:59.000]  I cannot look at her.
[3:04:59.000 --> 3:05:02.000]  She's Joe Bigger with infowars.com.
[3:05:02.000 --> 3:05:05.000]  CNN bashes conspiratorial questions about Hillary's health.
[3:05:05.000 --> 3:05:13.000]  CNN is attempting to dismiss questions about Hillary Clinton's health by asserting the photos which appear to show her struggling to climb some steps are old.
[3:05:13.000 --> 3:05:23.000]  However, the news network conveniently fails to mention the fact that both federal and NYPD sources have blown the whistle on Hillary's difficulties with balance and walking in the past.
[3:05:23.000 --> 3:05:33.000]  Under the headline Drudge Report, misleads readers with Hillary Clinton photo, CNN's Brian Settler writes that news aggregator Matt Drudge is taking a six month old photo out of context.
[3:05:33.000 --> 3:05:40.000]  Settler claims that the images merely show Hillary being aided after a slip and dismisses concerns about Hillary's health.
[3:05:40.000 --> 3:05:43.000]  In addition, the claims of John Cardio are not mentioned.
[3:05:43.000 --> 3:05:56.000]  Cardio told Reitbart about two different individuals, one a federal agent and another an NYPD officer who'd worked security at a Hillary event in New York City who both personally witnessed Hillary's walking difficulties.
[3:05:56.000 --> 3:06:15.000]  Dr. Joe Biggs with infowars.com.
[3:06:15.000 --> 3:06:27.000]  Right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease around.
[3:06:27.000 --> 3:06:31.000]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites.
[3:06:31.000 --> 3:06:33.000]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[3:06:33.000 --> 3:06:41.000]  You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[3:06:41.000 --> 3:06:47.000]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today. It just came back in yesterday. Living Defense, infowarslife.com.
[3:06:47.000 --> 3:06:50.000]  And folks, you can't lose. It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[3:06:50.000 --> 3:06:56.000]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com. Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[3:06:56.000 --> 3:07:12.000]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[3:07:27.000 --> 3:07:29.000]  I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[3:07:29.000 --> 3:07:42.000]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[3:07:42.000 --> 3:07:44.000]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[3:07:44.000 --> 3:07:50.000]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.

[3:08:30.000 --> 3:08:39.000]  Oh, baby, you're free to sit. Ain't no misery.
[3:08:39.000 --> 3:08:43.000]  Why all men misery?
[3:08:43.000 --> 3:08:47.000]  All right. They call us conspiracy theorists.
[3:08:47.000 --> 3:08:49.000]  They call us poking ghosts.
[3:08:49.000 --> 3:08:52.000]  Truth is, we're alive.
[3:08:52.000 --> 3:08:55.000]  They'd like to lock us up.
[3:08:55.000 --> 3:09:01.000]  Make us play their Pokemon. Not gonna happen.
[3:09:01.000 --> 3:09:04.000]  I don't want to be in your new World Order dungeon.
[3:09:04.000 --> 3:09:08.000]  I don't want to be in your globalist hell.
[3:09:08.000 --> 3:09:13.000]  Oh, there ain't no mystery.
[3:09:13.000 --> 3:09:18.000]  Why I'm in misery?
[3:09:18.000 --> 3:09:19.000]  Joe Biggs is with me.
[3:09:19.000 --> 3:09:21.000]  We got David Knight in the other studio about to hand the baton.
[3:09:21.000 --> 3:09:25.000]  Nightly news comes tonight at 7 o'clock Central Center time.
[3:09:25.000 --> 3:09:28.000]  Want to thank all the viewers and listeners and affiliates and sponsors for making this possible.
[3:09:28.000 --> 3:09:32.000]  Please stop thanking me. It is so humbling when we're out in public, Joe Biggs.
[3:09:32.000 --> 3:09:37.000]  And we run into sometimes thousands of listeners and fans over a weekend at the RNC or DNC.
[3:09:37.000 --> 3:09:43.000]  It's very humbling. Families are little kids and just really, all of them, their eyes are so alive,
[3:09:43.000 --> 3:09:47.000]  whether they be black or white or Hispanic or Asian.
[3:09:47.000 --> 3:09:51.000]  And it's just amazing to see it and it's disproportionate black Americans.
[3:09:51.000 --> 3:09:56.000]  I mean, I gotta say, InfoWars disproportionately has always had a larger group of, you know,
[3:09:56.000 --> 3:09:58.000]  a set of 13% of the population.
[3:09:58.000 --> 3:10:02.000]  I'd say in the United States, 20, 30% of our population is black.
[3:10:02.000 --> 3:10:04.000]  And I'm gonna patronize all you African Americans.
[3:10:04.000 --> 3:10:05.000]  It's a new name every week.
[3:10:05.000 --> 3:10:06.000]  Black folks are sick of all of it.
[3:10:06.000 --> 3:10:08.000]  I mean, I'm a pink folk.
[3:10:08.000 --> 3:10:09.000]  I kind of got goofy looking skin.
[3:10:09.000 --> 3:10:12.000]  But the point is, we're Americans.
[3:10:12.000 --> 3:10:15.000]  We all got red blood and people are sick of being put in these boxes.
[3:10:15.000 --> 3:10:18.000]  And I tell you the fact that Hillary can't get crowds anywhere.
[3:10:18.000 --> 3:10:21.000]  Again, it's indicative she's not really ahead of Trump.
[3:10:21.000 --> 3:10:22.000]  And then we get the nomenclature.
[3:10:22.000 --> 3:10:24.000]  We get the diagnostics.
[3:10:24.000 --> 3:10:29.000]  We get the methodology, the breakdown from Reuters and AP and others on all these polls
[3:10:29.000 --> 3:10:31.000]  where Hillary surged 10 to 15 points.
[3:10:31.000 --> 3:10:34.000]  They added 15% more Democrats.
[3:10:34.000 --> 3:10:38.000]  This is not brain surgery here, folks.
[3:10:38.000 --> 3:10:40.000]  I mean, what do you make of this?
[3:10:40.000 --> 3:10:43.000]  You get on social media, Donald Trump's exploding.
[3:10:43.000 --> 3:10:44.000]  He's everywhere.
[3:10:44.000 --> 3:10:45.000]  He's all over Reddit.
[3:10:45.000 --> 3:10:47.000]  Way better than Hillary.
[3:10:47.000 --> 3:10:48.000]  Twitter, everything.
[3:10:48.000 --> 3:10:49.000]  Find the censorship.
[3:10:49.000 --> 3:10:54.000]  There's a larger amount of accounts that are pro-Trump than there are Hillary Clinton.
[3:10:54.000 --> 3:10:57.000]  And when you look at the Hillary Clinton pages, guess what they are?
[3:10:57.000 --> 3:10:59.000]  Hillary for prison, handcuff Hillary.
[3:10:59.000 --> 3:11:01.000]  Hillary doesn't belong here.
[3:11:01.000 --> 3:11:03.000]  Hillary for saying Quentin, all this stuff.
[3:11:03.000 --> 3:11:05.000]  By the way, that was in the article about it.
[3:11:05.000 --> 3:11:08.000]  Hillary's most popular thing on social media is Hillary for prison.
[3:11:08.000 --> 3:11:09.000]  Exactly.
[3:11:09.000 --> 3:11:11.000]  And that is amazing.
[3:11:11.000 --> 3:11:14.000]  I'm sorry, it's funny.
[3:11:14.000 --> 3:11:17.000]  I want to play this clip.
[3:11:17.000 --> 3:11:21.000]  But first, David, I want to play this clip from one of the national TV shows.
[3:11:21.000 --> 3:11:23.000]  Who is it, Jimmy Kimmel?
[3:11:23.000 --> 3:11:28.000]  Where they do the same methodology we do, whether it's Austin or whether it's Cleveland
[3:11:28.000 --> 3:11:31.000]  or whether it's Philadelphia or whether it's LA.
[3:11:31.000 --> 3:11:37.000]  Our reporters or our auxiliary reporters like Mark Dice.
[3:11:37.000 --> 3:11:41.000]  He gets criticized that way, they go, why'd you just show dumb people?
[3:11:41.000 --> 3:11:42.000]  We're not doing that.
[3:11:42.000 --> 3:11:43.000]  There's a lot of dumb people.
[3:11:43.000 --> 3:11:46.000]  We are showing you basically everyone that had something to say.
[3:11:46.000 --> 3:11:52.000]  And eight out of ten in Austin Democrats want gun owners in forced labor and want to execute us.
[3:11:52.000 --> 3:11:56.000]  Eight out of ten want to kill newborn babies or up to age three.
[3:11:56.000 --> 3:11:57.000]  Those birth abortions.
[3:11:57.000 --> 3:12:01.000]  Eight out of ten want to ban homes bigger than 250 square feet.
[3:12:01.000 --> 3:12:04.000]  I mean, this is a cult of psychopaths.
[3:12:04.000 --> 3:12:05.000]  I mean, these are lunatics.
[3:12:05.000 --> 3:12:06.000]  I don't know what you call them.
[3:12:06.000 --> 3:12:07.000]  I'm not a psychiatrist.
[3:12:07.000 --> 3:12:08.000]  But I know this.
[3:12:08.000 --> 3:12:10.000]  They're freaking crazy in it.
[3:12:10.000 --> 3:12:11.000]  But you got to add one thing.
[3:12:11.000 --> 3:12:13.000]  For Obama, for Hillary.
[3:12:13.000 --> 3:12:16.000]  And that's what Jimmy Kimmel's show illustrated.
[3:12:16.000 --> 3:12:23.000]  Look at David Knight's take on it is, if you say it's for Hillary, if you say Hillary said it, they will support it.
[3:12:23.000 --> 3:12:24.000]  That's called being an occult.
[3:12:24.000 --> 3:12:31.000]  If Donald Trump came out and said, I want compulsory national service and I want you to worship me as God.
[3:12:31.000 --> 3:12:32.000]  I'd say, I'm done with Trump.
[3:12:32.000 --> 3:12:33.000]  He's crazy, blah, blah, blah.
[3:12:33.000 --> 3:12:35.000]  But see, not with them.
[3:12:35.000 --> 3:12:40.000]  If you had a cult follower, Trump wants everybody to drink cyanine Kool-Aid, they'd say, yes, yes, drink it.
[3:12:40.000 --> 3:12:42.000]  But see, Trump isn't doing that.
[3:12:42.000 --> 3:12:45.000]  This is literal cult behavior.
[3:12:45.000 --> 3:12:46.000]  Let's go to the club.
[3:12:46.000 --> 3:12:54.000]  What do you think when Hillary Clinton said, I see improved relations with Russia from a position of strength only as possible?
[3:12:54.000 --> 3:12:56.000]  I agree with Hillary.
[3:12:56.000 --> 3:13:03.000]  Hillary Clinton said that immigration is a privilege and we should not let anyone into this country who doesn't support our communities, all of our communities.
[3:13:03.000 --> 3:13:06.000]  Well, I'd virtually have to agree with that.
[3:13:06.000 --> 3:13:12.000]  Hillary said, in order to achieve the American dream, let people keep more money in their pockets and increase after-tax wages.
[3:13:12.000 --> 3:13:14.000]  Yes, okay.
[3:13:14.000 --> 3:13:23.000]  It's in order, that's a great idea so that we can start to move everybody up and start moving people out of the level of poverty.
[3:13:23.000 --> 3:13:27.000]  And obviously runs fairly severe contrast to what Donald Trump is proposing?
[3:13:27.000 --> 3:13:28.000]  Absolutely.
[3:13:28.000 --> 3:13:31.000]  Many of her comments run severe contrast to Donald Trump.
[3:13:31.000 --> 3:13:33.000]  I agree with this quote from Hillary.
[3:13:33.000 --> 3:13:37.000]  There's nothing I love more than women, but they're really a lot different than portrayed.
[3:13:37.000 --> 3:13:41.000]  They're far worse than men, far more aggressive, and boy, can they be smart.
[3:13:41.000 --> 3:13:42.000]  You know, I agree.
[3:13:42.000 --> 3:13:45.000]  I've worked for 38 years in the hospital with women.
[3:13:45.000 --> 3:13:47.000]  That's very accurate.
[3:13:47.000 --> 3:13:50.000]  And you think that's obviously a sharp contrast to her opponent?
[3:13:50.000 --> 3:13:52.000]  Absolutely.
[3:13:52.000 --> 3:13:55.000]  Hillary Clinton said, I like the concept of local education.
[3:13:55.000 --> 3:13:56.000]  I want to get rid of Common Core.
[3:13:56.000 --> 3:13:58.000]  I think Common Core is a disaster.
[3:13:58.000 --> 3:14:00.000]  Well, I'm an educator.
[3:14:00.000 --> 3:14:02.000]  I'm a school teacher.
[3:14:02.000 --> 3:14:05.000]  I think Common Core is a disaster too.
[3:14:05.000 --> 3:14:07.000]  And what do you think of this Hillary quote?
[3:14:07.000 --> 3:14:09.000]  I have never seen a thin person drinking Diet Coke.
[3:14:09.000 --> 3:14:12.000]  You've never seen a thin person drinking Diet Coke?
[3:14:12.000 --> 3:14:14.000]  Well, let me tell you something.
[3:14:14.000 --> 3:14:17.000]  Diet Coke does not make you thin.
[3:14:17.000 --> 3:14:21.000]  So you would say, get rid of Common Core, keep the Diet Coke.
[3:14:21.000 --> 3:14:23.000]  What do you think of this Hillary Clinton quote?
[3:14:23.000 --> 3:14:25.000]  I am opposed to gay marriage.
[3:14:25.000 --> 3:14:28.000]  Well, I've heard that a lot from a lot of politicians.
[3:14:28.000 --> 3:14:31.000]  It's all about the timing though, isn't it?
[3:14:31.000 --> 3:14:33.000]  No, hey, she's for us now.
[3:14:33.000 --> 3:14:34.000]  Yay!
[3:14:34.000 --> 3:14:36.000]  I'll take that as a win.
[3:14:36.000 --> 3:14:38.000]  What do you think of this quote from Hillary Clinton?
[3:14:38.000 --> 3:14:40.000]  Well, Beth Midler is an extremely unattractive woman.
[3:14:40.000 --> 3:14:44.000]  I refuse to say that because I always insist on being politically correct.
[3:14:44.000 --> 3:14:47.000]  I am sure that she never said that.
[3:14:47.000 --> 3:14:50.000]  You're right. Please don't say that.
[3:14:50.000 --> 3:14:52.000]  I can't make it a guarantee.
[3:14:52.000 --> 3:14:55.000]  So the one Democratic operative kind of a master spider got what it was.
[3:14:55.000 --> 3:15:00.000]  David Knight, is that not illustrative? We're not out trying to make people look dumb.
[3:15:00.000 --> 3:15:04.000]  We show the people. This is how crazy they are.
[3:15:04.000 --> 3:15:07.000]  If you just say it's for Hillary or Obama, they go along with it.
[3:15:07.000 --> 3:15:12.000]  David actually spoke to this lady at the DNC and laid out every reason why she shouldn't be present.
[3:15:12.000 --> 3:15:14.000]  She goes, well, I still think she's trustworthy.
[3:15:14.000 --> 3:15:18.000]  Yeah, talked about all the different issues with leaking information.
[3:15:18.000 --> 3:15:24.000]  She's trying to sell this idea that Donald Trump had some kind of alliance with the Russians to hack the DNC.
[3:15:24.000 --> 3:15:29.000]  Alex, I spent a week at the DNC talking to these very people.
[3:15:29.000 --> 3:15:35.000]  It is a herd mentality. They need a t-shirt that says I'm with herd because that's really what it is.
[3:15:35.000 --> 3:15:37.000]  There's a great political cartoon that we tweeted out.
[3:15:37.000 --> 3:15:39.000]  My wife saw it. I tweeted it out as well.
[3:15:39.000 --> 3:15:45.000]  There's all these sheep around at the Democrat convention and they're saying she would never do anything bad.
[3:15:45.000 --> 3:15:48.000]  And she would never pull the wool over our eyes.
[3:15:48.000 --> 3:15:53.000]  They are sheep. No matter what you tell them, they always say she's loyal and trustworthy.
[3:15:53.000 --> 3:15:57.000]  And honest and, you know, you can't convince them otherwise.
[3:15:57.000 --> 3:16:02.000]  Why does Hillary have armed guards but you can't?
[3:16:02.000 --> 3:16:07.000]  Why does Mexico have borders that we can't?
[3:16:07.000 --> 3:16:09.000]  You know, Alex, there's an update.
[3:16:09.000 --> 3:16:13.000]  Mikhail Phelan just handed me a new story at infowars.com.
[3:16:13.000 --> 3:16:17.000]  WikiLeaks is not convinced at all that Russia had anything to do with it.
[3:16:17.000 --> 3:16:19.000]  Of course, they were the ones who released their information.
[3:16:19.000 --> 3:16:23.000]  They went towards its own private intelligence.
[3:16:23.000 --> 3:16:31.000]  Yes, but they just put out, tweeted out, a $20,000 reward for information on the murdered DNC staffer, Seth Rich.
[3:16:31.000 --> 3:16:32.000]  Who did?
[3:16:32.000 --> 3:16:37.000]  WikiLeaks did. They put out a $20,000 reward for information about this DNC staffer.
[3:16:37.000 --> 3:16:42.000]  That goes towards what you were saying earlier and others were saying that that may be the leak source.
[3:16:42.000 --> 3:16:45.000]  Yeah, because he was a data analyst for the DNC.
[3:16:45.000 --> 3:16:48.000]  They said if anybody could have gotten a hold of that information, it would have been him.
[3:16:48.000 --> 3:16:51.000]  He had to release his info now. He's not safe in that embassy.
[3:16:51.000 --> 3:16:56.000]  And then Assange said that it was not Russia, so definitely it could point to someone like this.
[3:16:56.000 --> 3:17:01.000]  And then it's going to go to who else had ties with Seth Rich and who else had that kind of access.
[3:17:01.000 --> 3:17:06.000]  That's like five different DNC people, three of them involved with the technicals dying in the last month.
[3:17:06.000 --> 3:17:10.000]  And of course, he was beaten and shot and he was not robbed.
[3:17:10.000 --> 3:17:16.000]  Okay, I know this is DC and it's a model of a criminal city, but he was not robbed.
[3:17:16.000 --> 3:17:20.000]  So, you know, all these different things, of course, is just a conspiracy theory.
[3:17:20.000 --> 3:17:22.000]  I'm sure Hillary Clinton would say.
[3:17:22.000 --> 3:17:25.000]  I mean, he could have shot himself in the back of the head twice. That's kind of normal.
[3:17:25.000 --> 3:17:27.000]  Yeah, don't be racist against bullets.
[3:17:27.000 --> 3:17:30.000]  Getting serious here, though. Wow, WikiLeaks is coming out and saying this.
[3:17:30.000 --> 3:17:34.000]  Well, Assange has pointed out that what he's got is supposedly going to bring down Hillary.
[3:17:34.000 --> 3:17:37.000]  I don't know what he's waiting for, David.
[3:17:37.000 --> 3:17:41.000]  Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I've got another article from Julian Assange.
[3:17:41.000 --> 3:17:47.000]  He went on Russia today and he talked about the fact that, of course, this is an article from Steve Watson that's on Infowars.com.
[3:17:47.000 --> 3:17:52.000]  Assange pointed out the fact that Trump really doesn't have any connections in Russia.
[3:17:52.000 --> 3:17:57.000]  He hasn't been able to build any hotels since Putin took office there.
[3:17:57.000 --> 3:18:00.000]  So, he doesn't have any influence there. He can't even get a hotel built.
[3:18:00.000 --> 3:18:06.000]  And yet, Hillary Clinton, as he pointed out, was involved in that massive uranium deal that we've talked about for so long.
[3:18:06.000 --> 3:18:12.000]  Well, he said that she's got more connections to Russia than anybody he's ever seen, except for the Saudis, and she's totally run by them.
[3:18:12.000 --> 3:18:17.000]  Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah, that's a key point, is the Saudi Arabian integration.
[3:18:17.000 --> 3:18:22.000]  And by the way, that's what Russia's supposed to do with its intelligence agencies is fight for Russia.
[3:18:22.000 --> 3:18:28.000]  And then we're supposed to fight for us, and Putin gets that. It's just we're not going to have nuclear war with each other.
[3:18:28.000 --> 3:18:35.000]  Yeah, I understand why people are so obsessed with wanting to make them our enemy when we have one candidate in Trump
[3:18:35.000 --> 3:18:38.000]  who wants to make him an ally. Leave them be. Let them do what they want to do.
[3:18:38.000 --> 3:18:41.000]  Well, look at all the Islamic terror. Be perfect to link up with Russia.
[3:18:41.000 --> 3:18:48.000]  Yeah, you know, when we look at what's going on with Russia, I had these two women that I talked to that were there at the convention
[3:18:48.000 --> 3:18:56.000]  trying to lobby on behalf of Ukraine. One of them wanted to sell the idea that Donald Trump was involved with the Russians to take down the DNC.
[3:18:56.000 --> 3:19:03.000]  She was the one that I went back and forth with and said, really, do you understand the history of how the security establishment
[3:19:03.000 --> 3:19:08.000]  has come after legitimate whistleblowers like Thomas Drake? Do you understand that?
[3:19:08.000 --> 3:19:12.000]  Do you understand what she really did and how she exposed people?
[3:19:12.000 --> 3:19:16.000]  Many people, they believe, died because of her security leaks.
[3:19:16.000 --> 3:19:26.000]  And then the other woman wanted to push for the fact that we needed to step things up and send in lethal aid to Ukraine to fight the Russians and the Crimea.
[3:19:26.000 --> 3:19:35.000]  And I said, really, do you think we really want to go to war in order to stop this dispute of secession and civil war between Crimea and the Ukraine?
[3:19:35.000 --> 3:19:39.000]  Of course, she thinks that Ukraine should secede from Russia, but not Crimea from Ukraine.
[3:19:39.000 --> 3:19:42.000]  And she doesn't even know that George Soros started the whole thing to begin with with Hillary.
[3:19:42.000 --> 3:19:45.000]  And again, not bashing women, but it is archetypal.
[3:19:45.000 --> 3:19:52.000]  They have all these weird power-tripping women in super suits and fancy outfits blustering how they're going to kick the Russians' butts.
[3:19:52.000 --> 3:20:00.000]  It's just wreaks of idiocy. It's crazy. And it won't help our country either, but it will help the big defense contractors. David Knight takes over.

[3:23:53.000 --> 3:24:15.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Tuesday, August 9th, 2016. I'm David Knight.
[3:24:15.000 --> 3:24:25.000]  We're just talking about a breaking story. WikiLeaks offering a $20,000 reward for information on the murder of a DNC staffer that's Seth Rich,
[3:24:25.000 --> 3:24:33.000]  who was beaten and shot to death in D.C. We're going to have more on that story as well as more information about what Julian Assange said about Hillary.
[3:24:33.000 --> 3:24:37.000]  What Hillary said about WikiLeaks. We're going to have all that back and forth.
[3:24:37.000 --> 3:24:45.000]  As well as, of course, the top story on Drudge Report is Twilight Zone. Orlando Terrace Dad cheers the Clintons.
[3:24:45.000 --> 3:24:48.000]  Will Hillary disown this? That's the question.
[3:24:48.000 --> 3:24:52.000]  So we're going to cover that. That's our story at infowars.com.
[3:24:52.000 --> 3:24:59.000]  By Paul Joseph Watson, we're going to take a look at what we've now learned about Hillary's biggest talofan.
[3:24:59.000 --> 3:25:02.000]  That's what the Daily Caller calls him. Of course, we've got the talofan now.
[3:25:02.000 --> 3:25:08.000]  We've got Sharia Khan, a couple of guys. I think it's very telling the hypocrisy of Hillary Clinton.
[3:25:08.000 --> 3:25:14.000]  But before we get to those stories, I want to play for you some other breaking information that we've got here.
[3:25:14.000 --> 3:25:20.000]  This is an exclusive we got here. This is a new phone call message that's been intercepted.
[3:25:20.000 --> 3:25:26.000]  This was sent from Ahmed Dinajab to Barack Obama. But of course, they're friends.
[3:25:26.000 --> 3:25:33.000]  So Ahmed Dinajab, understand, calls him Barry. You'll hear him call him Barry in this clip. Let's run that clip.
[3:25:33.000 --> 3:25:40.000]  What can I do for you? Show me the money.
[3:25:40.000 --> 3:25:44.000]  Yeah, Barry, show me the money.
[3:25:44.000 --> 3:25:49.000]  Ahmed Dinajab is telling Obama, even after all of this cash just broke this last week,
[3:25:49.000 --> 3:25:54.000]  I guess he decided it was time to double down and really punish his good friend Barry.
[3:25:54.000 --> 3:26:00.000]  So he's telling him, come on, man, you still have time to send me the other $2 billion I say you owe me.
[3:26:00.000 --> 3:26:05.000]  If he was Jewish, then we'd call that Hutzpah. But he's not. He's Iranian.
[3:26:05.000 --> 3:26:10.000]  Now, of course, he sends him this letter and it begins with a traditional Islamic greeting.
[3:26:10.000 --> 3:26:13.000]  As-salamu alaikum, I guess, if that's the way you pronounce it.
[3:26:13.000 --> 3:26:17.000]  I'm sure I will become much more of an expert with all the Muslims that we're bringing to this country.
[3:26:17.000 --> 3:26:21.000]  I'll be able to pronounce that precisely, very shortly, I'm sure.
[3:26:21.000 --> 3:26:24.000]  But he went on to say, your campaign slogan was change.
[3:26:24.000 --> 3:26:28.000]  You claim to be determined to change those policies as well as your behavior.
[3:26:28.000 --> 3:26:32.000]  So in other words, Barry, send me the money. Send me your change.
[3:26:32.000 --> 3:26:35.000]  All your change, you can send it in any kind of currency you want.
[3:26:35.000 --> 3:26:37.000]  Just put it on the plane and fly it over.
[3:26:37.000 --> 3:26:43.000]  You know, they had to have a plane to get that $400 million worth of cash and foreign currency to them.
[3:26:43.000 --> 3:26:46.000]  I wonder how many planes it would take to get $2 billion.
[3:26:46.000 --> 3:26:50.000]  You know, we could work that out mathematically with a lot of how many pallets would that be.
[3:26:50.000 --> 3:26:56.000]  But remember that in April, the Supreme Court ruled that Iranian assets worth $2 billion must be paid to American families,
[3:26:56.000 --> 3:27:04.000]  whose relatives were killed in Beirut and Saudi Arabian military attacks that the U.S. government said were the cause of Iran.
[3:27:04.000 --> 3:27:08.000]  They took place in 1983, 1996, the Kubar Tower bombings.
[3:27:08.000 --> 3:27:13.000]  Understand how this is rolled out by the Democrats, okay?
[3:27:13.000 --> 3:27:16.000]  We had Hillary Clinton say, hey, this is an old story.
[3:27:16.000 --> 3:27:19.000]  No, it's an old conspiracy, okay?
[3:27:19.000 --> 3:27:22.000]  This is something we didn't learn about until last Wednesday.
[3:27:22.000 --> 3:27:23.000]  It's not even been a week.
[3:27:23.000 --> 3:27:25.000]  But immediately she said, this is an old story.
[3:27:25.000 --> 3:27:36.000]  What was new about it was the fact that we saw for a fact that Wall Street Journal and others uncovered the fact that this was done as a money laundering expedition.
[3:27:36.000 --> 3:27:41.000]  Of course, as a national review pointed out, another went through various phases, okay?
[3:27:41.000 --> 3:27:42.000]  They say, well, this is an old story.
[3:27:42.000 --> 3:27:43.000]  It's already been talked about.
[3:27:43.000 --> 3:27:44.000]  I'm not going to talk anymore about it.
[3:27:44.000 --> 3:27:45.000]  That's Hillary's approach.
[3:27:45.000 --> 3:27:49.000]  Of course, the media covers for them and say, hey, Donald Trump is talking about that.
[3:27:49.000 --> 3:27:50.000]  He's looking at B-roll.
[3:27:50.000 --> 3:27:52.000]  That's not an actual plane.
[3:27:52.000 --> 3:28:06.000]  Then when we started to say, well, it's ransom, they said, well, no, it was just a coincidence that they picked the day that the hostages are going to be released to release this $400 million in foreign currency from a Swiss bank, a Swiss central bank.
[3:28:06.000 --> 3:28:08.000]  Put it on a secret flight to send it to them.
[3:28:08.000 --> 3:28:10.000]  That was all just a coincidence, okay?
[3:28:10.000 --> 3:28:16.000]  But then we had the hostage pastor come out and say, no, we were told we were held overnight for many, many hours.
[3:28:16.000 --> 3:28:17.000]  We had to sleep there.
[3:28:17.000 --> 3:28:20.000]  We're told you're not leaving until the other plane gets here.
[3:28:20.000 --> 3:28:22.000]  So, okay, now it's a ransom.
[3:28:22.000 --> 3:28:24.000]  We can call it iransum, okay?
[3:28:24.000 --> 3:28:28.000]  That's what it ought to be instead of a Watergate or some ransom gate.
[3:28:28.000 --> 3:28:32.000]  It should be called the iransum story here.
[3:28:32.000 --> 3:28:35.000]  Now, Barack Obama said, well, we had to do that.
[3:28:35.000 --> 3:28:37.000]  We can't just write them a check.
[3:28:37.000 --> 3:28:43.000]  The National Review said, that's right, you can't just write them a check because that would be a violation of law.
[3:28:43.000 --> 3:28:47.000]  That would be a violation of your own sanctions that you have renewed every year.
[3:28:47.000 --> 3:28:52.000]  That have been renewed every year since 1995 when Bill Clinton put them on Iran, okay?
[3:28:52.000 --> 3:28:59.000]  Understand the fact that when the Department of Justice said, we don't want you to do this, they weren't saying, they didn't want to do that because it was bad policy.
[3:28:59.000 --> 3:29:01.000]  It was because it was illegal.
[3:29:01.000 --> 3:29:04.000]  And let me read you some of the laws here, okay?
[3:29:04.000 --> 3:29:13.000]  Just five months ago, as a matter of fact, after iransum, Obama said, Iran has been designated, this is his statement, okay?
[3:29:13.000 --> 3:29:16.000]  Has been designated a state sponsor of terrorism in 1984.
[3:29:16.000 --> 3:29:20.000]  Iran has continued its terrorist-related activities in 2015.
[3:29:20.000 --> 3:29:26.000]  And then, of course, the law says the exportation sales supply directly or indirectly from the U.S., okay?
[3:29:26.000 --> 3:29:28.000]  Wherever it's located is prohibited.
[3:29:28.000 --> 3:29:32.000]  On the very same day they got the hostages and gave them the secret payoff,
[3:29:32.000 --> 3:29:37.000]  the Treasury Department said the clearing of U.S. dollar currency-denominated transactions is prohibited.
[3:29:37.000 --> 3:29:43.000]  And that is punishable as a felony with up to 20 years in prison.
[3:29:43.000 --> 3:29:49.000]  But, of course, we have reached the point in America where powerful people are not punished according to the law, just the rest of us.
[3:29:49.000 --> 3:29:52.000]  Here on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[3:29:52.000 --> 3:30:02.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:23.000 --> 3:30:25.000]  Hillary Clinton as their undisputed candidate for president.
[3:30:25.000 --> 3:30:30.000]  Here are some examples from the editorial produced as part of that coverage by the team.
[3:30:30.000 --> 3:30:33.000]  Donald Trump steals wages. He'd pick your pocket in a New York minute.
[3:30:33.000 --> 3:30:36.000]  He lies and spreads hate. He's a racist in a bully.
[3:30:36.000 --> 3:30:38.000]  You're not underestimating Trump and the Republicans.
[3:30:38.000 --> 3:30:43.000]  While the establishment GOP was surprised by the successful insurgency of so-called outsider Trump,
[3:30:43.000 --> 3:30:53.000]  they are united in purpose, delivering more inequality, more misery, more instability, and violence against working-class people of all races, genders, religions, and sexual orientations.
[3:30:53.000 --> 3:30:56.000]  The party also gave a big thumbs up to Clinton's running mate, Tim Kaine.
[3:30:56.000 --> 3:31:14.000]  You can find more reports like this at infowars.com.

[3:31:43.000 --> 3:31:49.000]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force, and came in.

[3:33:22.000 --> 3:33:30.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight, and we're going to return to more political intrigue and hypocrisy and lies in just a moment.
[3:33:30.000 --> 3:33:34.000]  But before we do, I want to talk to you about something serious, dog sperm.
[3:33:34.000 --> 3:33:44.000]  Yes, this is a story from the Drudge Report, and it actually is quite serious because, you know, the dogs in this case are really kind of like canaries and a coal mine.
[3:33:44.000 --> 3:33:49.000]  Things happen more quickly to dogs and other animals because they have a shorter lifespan.
[3:33:49.000 --> 3:33:55.000]  What this story tells us is something we've been telling you about the food supply for a very long time.
[3:33:55.000 --> 3:34:01.000]  And what they're talking about here, quite frankly, is the sperm quality in dogs has fallen rapidly over the past three decades.
[3:34:01.000 --> 3:34:05.000]  This is a trend, they said, that could help to explain the decline in human fertility.
[3:34:05.000 --> 3:34:10.000]  We're seeing throughout the West, and it's been blamed on sociological issues.
[3:34:10.000 --> 3:34:21.000]  I mean, a lot of people say, well, you know, it's just as we become more, we have this modern lifestyle and women are interested in their careers and they're delaying childbearing.
[3:34:21.000 --> 3:34:24.000]  And yes, all those things are contributing factors, okay?
[3:34:24.000 --> 3:34:32.000]  But when you look at a situation where throughout the West, you're now getting to reproduction rates that are just barely above one.
[3:34:32.000 --> 3:34:36.000]  You have to be over two in order to even maintain your population.
[3:34:36.000 --> 3:34:45.000]  So we see throughout Europe, for example, the Italians who just a couple of generations ago used to have an average five, six kids or more in their families,
[3:34:45.000 --> 3:34:49.000]  all of a sudden that dropped to the lowest in Europe.
[3:34:49.000 --> 3:34:51.000]  So they're just barely over one.
[3:34:51.000 --> 3:35:05.000]  Now, it's not strictly sociological, I believe, and many other people believe, that there are physiological things that are going on that are tied to the kinds of things that we're exposed to in terms of our food,
[3:35:05.000 --> 3:35:09.000]  the additives that go into our food in terms of chemicals that we're exposed to the environment.
[3:35:09.000 --> 3:35:14.000]  And this is what they're seeing, of course, in the dogs because it's going to show up in dogs more quickly.
[3:35:14.000 --> 3:35:19.000]  They say they highlighted a potential link between environmental contaminants and fertility.
[3:35:19.000 --> 3:35:26.000]  Scientists discovered chemicals which have a detrimental effect on sperm function and some commercially available pet foods.
[3:35:26.000 --> 3:35:31.000]  Understand that it's not significantly different for humans either.
[3:35:31.000 --> 3:35:39.000]  The difference is they can see these effects more quickly and they can do more tests on the dogs than they're going to do on humans.
[3:35:39.000 --> 3:35:46.000]  They say this is the first time such a decline in male fertility has been reported in the dog and we believe this is due to environmental contaminants,
[3:35:46.000 --> 3:35:53.000]  some of which we have detected in dog food and in the sperm and in the testes of the dogs themselves.
[3:35:53.000 --> 3:35:55.000]  This is from the new scientist.
[3:35:55.000 --> 3:35:58.000]  This is one of the reasons that we have the kind of products that we have here, folks.
[3:35:58.000 --> 3:36:03.000]  We're not selling products and then creating a need to sell these products.
[3:36:03.000 --> 3:36:06.000]  There is a need for these products is why Alex has created these.
[3:36:06.000 --> 3:36:15.000]  And so we have products like a super male vitality like Anthroplex that are designed to help you fight these kind of environmental challenges that you have,
[3:36:15.000 --> 3:36:18.000]  the kind of estrogen or the hormonal disruptions.
[3:36:18.000 --> 3:36:21.000]  And of course, there are things that disrupt estrogen in women as well.
[3:36:21.000 --> 3:36:23.000]  We have products for that as well.
[3:36:23.000 --> 3:36:30.000]  We have a special right now on Anthroplex, 40% off at infowarslife.com, 40% off.
[3:36:30.000 --> 3:36:32.000]  That is a huge sale, okay?
[3:36:32.000 --> 3:36:35.000]  Also, we have other sales.
[3:36:35.000 --> 3:36:40.000]  We have a premium power pack, 20% off at infowarsstore.com.
[3:36:40.000 --> 3:36:44.000]  And I believe we still have infowarsstore.com free shipping.
[3:36:44.000 --> 3:36:45.000]  Is that correct, guys?
[3:36:45.000 --> 3:36:46.000]  Yeah, we still have that.
[3:36:46.000 --> 3:36:49.000]  Okay, so everything at the store is free shipping.
[3:36:49.000 --> 3:36:56.000]  But also, as you're looking at what's going on in our environment, what's in your food, think about what you need to do to try to combat that.
[3:36:56.000 --> 3:36:59.000]  Of course, you can get cleaner sources of food and that's very important.
[3:36:59.000 --> 3:37:05.000]  But there's so many different ways that you can be exposed to environmental contaminants and food and other chemicals.
[3:37:05.000 --> 3:37:09.000]  Take things that will actually help your system, things like Anthroplex.
[3:37:09.000 --> 3:37:13.000]  And it's 40% off at infowarslife.com.
[3:37:13.000 --> 3:37:19.000]  Now, I want to go to some videos that we have of Hillary Clinton and Julian Assange.
[3:37:19.000 --> 3:37:20.000]  There's a back and forth going on.
[3:37:20.000 --> 3:37:24.000]  Of course, Hillary Clinton is just dismissing this stuff as a bunch of conspiracy theories.
[3:37:24.000 --> 3:37:34.000]  But I want to play for you the video that we have of Julian Assange talking about the Russian supposed Russian connection with Donald Trump.
[3:37:34.000 --> 3:37:40.000]  Any Russian connections between Hillary Clinton and Russia? Any Russian connections there?
[3:37:40.000 --> 3:37:51.000]  Hillary Clinton has done quite well strategically to try and draw connection between Trump and Russia because she has so many connections of her own.
[3:37:51.000 --> 3:37:59.000]  Now, my analysis of Trump and Russia is that there is no substantial connection.
[3:37:59.000 --> 3:38:01.000]  Why do I say that?
[3:38:01.000 --> 3:38:11.000]  Well, because Trump was trying to invest in Russia before Putin in the 1990s, after Putin, in fact, nearly all the way up to the present moment.
[3:38:11.000 --> 3:38:16.000]  And he's had no success. He did not manage to build hotels and so on in Russia.
[3:38:16.000 --> 3:38:23.000]  So that shows how insubstantial his contacts are.
[3:38:23.000 --> 3:38:36.000]  There's an extremely well-documented pattern of when Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, those people, companies, governments who wanted a decision by the Secretary of State in their favor,
[3:38:36.000 --> 3:38:44.000]  making large donations to the Clinton Foundation or, in some other cases, business deals with the people around Hillary Clinton.
[3:38:44.000 --> 3:39:02.000]  Now, one particular instance is the approval by Secretary Clinton of selling 20% of the U.S.-Uranium reprocessing rights to a Russian company to be exported to Russia.
[3:39:02.000 --> 3:39:09.000]  So at that time, a large donation was made by those Russian interests to the Clinton Foundation.
[3:39:09.000 --> 3:39:16.000]  In addition, Clinton's campaign manager, Podesta, was on the board of a company called Jewel Unlimited.
[3:39:16.000 --> 3:39:26.000]  And Jewel Unlimited held some of these rights and received a $35 million investment from Russia.
[3:39:26.000 --> 3:39:28.000]  That's a Russian government company.
[3:39:28.000 --> 3:39:35.000]  And also, Russians were on the board also with Podesta.
[3:39:35.000 --> 3:39:39.000]  The kind of email revelations from WikiLeaks reveal that Hillary Clinton is a Kremlin stooge.
[3:39:39.000 --> 3:39:52.000]  I wouldn't say Kremlin stooge, but there is a much deeper connection on record with Hillary Clinton and Russia than we are presently aware of with Donald Trump.
[3:39:52.000 --> 3:39:54.000]  I wouldn't say she's a Kremlin stooge either.
[3:39:54.000 --> 3:40:00.000]  I would say she is a corrupt politician who is for sale to anyone for any amount.
[3:40:00.000 --> 3:40:07.000]  Remember what he just said there, 20% of U.S.-Uranium capacity was sold to the Russians.
[3:40:07.000 --> 3:40:13.000]  And it was a sweetheart deal for Hillary Clinton's close friend and adviser, Podesta.
[3:40:13.000 --> 3:40:15.000]  But of course, there's also connections to Saudi Arabia.
[3:40:15.000 --> 3:40:19.000]  I want to play what Julian Assange said about Saudi Arabia.
[3:40:19.000 --> 3:40:23.000]  What is the connection between Hillary Clinton and Saudi Arabia that certainly got Israel angry?
[3:40:23.000 --> 3:40:24.000]  It's extensive.
[3:40:24.000 --> 3:40:37.000]  I mean, the relationships between Hillary Clinton and Saudi Arabia, between the Clinton Foundation and Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabia is probably the largest single donor to the Clinton Foundation.
[3:40:37.000 --> 3:40:55.000]  And you can see Clinton's arms export policies while she was Secretary of State, favoring extensively Saudi Arabia.
[3:40:55.000 --> 3:41:07.000]  Absolutely. And you know, there's a story at Breitbart pointing out how Hillary Clinton's State Department rubber-stamped visas for record number of Saudi visitors.
[3:41:07.000 --> 3:41:13.000]  Remember that they're bragging about the fact that they gave Hillary Clinton 20% of her campaign funds.
[3:41:13.000 --> 3:41:16.000]  We'll get to that in just a moment and we've talked about that before as well.
[3:41:16.000 --> 3:41:19.000]  But it's important to remember this, to put this all in context.
[3:41:19.000 --> 3:41:33.000]  So despite, this is Breitbart, despite evidence that Saudi Arabian terrorists exploit the U.S. visa program, and that would be the visa program, the EB-5 visa program that Khazir Khan, or as I like to call him, Sharia Khan, specialized in.
[3:41:33.000 --> 3:41:46.000]  Okay, he specialized in getting people from Saudi Arabian, some other Arabian countries into this country using that visa program EB-5, which has been flagged by a lot of people in Congress as well as Homeland Security,
[3:41:46.000 --> 3:41:52.000]  as being a very fraudulent system, one that is fraught with a lot of security issues.
[3:41:52.000 --> 3:41:55.000]  But this is what she did for them as Secretary of State.
[3:41:55.000 --> 3:42:04.000]  She doubled the number of visas for Saudi visitors while helping to cut a deal with the kingdom to waive security procedures for Saudi nationals.
[3:42:04.000 --> 3:42:16.000]  With their arrival, the U.S. counter-Jihad has learned, they point out that annual number of non-immigrant visas issued to Saudi nationals soared 93% during her tenure as Secretary of State.
[3:42:16.000 --> 3:42:28.000]  They said that it also would allow Saudi visa holders, this is what Hillary Clinton did, allowed Saudi visa holders to enter the U.S. as, quote, trusted travelers.
[3:42:28.000 --> 3:42:32.000]  Okay, they could bypass normal border security processes.
[3:42:32.000 --> 3:42:41.000]  Trusted travelers, you know, kind of like George Bush trusted the bin Laden's and flew them out the day after 9-11 on 9-12.
[3:42:41.000 --> 3:42:45.000]  He flew them out even as they were blaming Osama bin Laden for the 9-11 terrorist attacks.
[3:42:45.000 --> 3:42:47.000]  They fly his family out.
[3:42:47.000 --> 3:42:51.000]  And of course, we've seen the connections in the 28 pages.
[3:42:51.000 --> 3:42:55.000]  We know how closely Saudi intelligence is linked with the CIA.
[3:42:55.000 --> 3:43:01.000]  We know that they are linked with the Federal Reserve, the petrodollar that was created by Nixon and Kissinger.
[3:43:01.000 --> 3:43:08.000]  But to say that they're trusted travelers, no, really, I think she meant to say they were trust fund travelers.
[3:43:08.000 --> 3:43:13.000]  You know, the people who give her the cash, who provide her with her trust fund.
[3:43:13.000 --> 3:43:21.000]  This story that we've covered before as well from Zero Hedge or Saudi Arabia bragged that they'd funded 20% of Hillary's presidential campaign.
[3:43:21.000 --> 3:43:27.000]  Okay, and understand this happened at the same time as the Orlando shooting.
[3:43:27.000 --> 3:43:33.000]  So when we look at this Twilight Zone headline that Drudge is featuring at the Drudge Report today,
[3:43:33.000 --> 3:43:41.000]  the fact that you would have the father of the Orlando shooter at her rally, as Biggs has pointed out,
[3:43:41.000 --> 3:43:45.000]  that they would vet him and deliberately put him behind her.
[3:43:45.000 --> 3:43:49.000]  That's not something that just anybody that goes to the rally gets to be behind the candidate.
[3:43:49.000 --> 3:43:53.000]  They would let him go to the rally, put him behind her.
[3:43:53.000 --> 3:44:00.000]  This is a statement that was made as the Orlando shooting took place.
[3:44:00.000 --> 3:44:10.000]  Hillary Clinton said, it is long past time for the Saudis, for the Qataris, for the Kuwaitis and others to stop their citizens from funding extremist organizations.
[3:44:10.000 --> 3:44:17.000]  And they should stop supporting radical schools and mosques around the world that have set so many young people on a path towards extremism.
[3:44:17.000 --> 3:44:22.000]  Yet she's the one who doubled the number of people coming in from Saudi Arabia.
[3:44:22.000 --> 3:44:28.000]  She's the one who made them trusted travelers, okay, greasing the skids for these people.
[3:44:28.000 --> 3:44:32.000]  Why? Because of money. That's why.
[3:44:32.000 --> 3:44:37.000]  So you got her doing this and making this speech right as the Orlando shooting is taking place.
[3:44:37.000 --> 3:44:44.000]  You've got her putting Kazir Khan, the guy who supports Sharia law, who has commented on it many times.
[3:44:44.000 --> 3:44:56.000]  She has written fawning reviews of the analyses and the papers about Sharia law that have been done by the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood and others.
[3:44:56.000 --> 3:45:02.000]  She chooses that guy to speak just before she accepts the nomination.
[3:45:02.000 --> 3:45:08.000]  The guy who supports the system of law and understand this folks, Islam is not just simply religion.
[3:45:08.000 --> 3:45:11.000]  It is a theocracy that they are selling you, okay?
[3:45:11.000 --> 3:45:24.000]  It is a unification of church and state. These are the Democrats who go to such links to say that no expression of Christianity is allowed because we must maintain this extreme separation of church and state.
[3:45:24.000 --> 3:45:39.000]  So you're not free to practice your religion if you're a Christian, but if you're a Muslim and you want to throw women off the bus and gays under the bus, then you are welcome to introduce Hillary Clinton when you support that kind of Sharia law.
[3:45:39.000 --> 3:45:44.000]  She comes out and talks about how dangerous the Saudis are as the Orlando shooting is going on.
[3:45:44.000 --> 3:45:51.000]  But there was a report, and this is one thing that we didn't really talk about in detail off this Zero Hedge article a couple of weeks ago.
[3:45:51.000 --> 3:45:57.000]  When this article came out, this information was put out by the Petra News Agency, okay?
[3:45:57.000 --> 3:46:02.000]  And what they had were comments from the Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
[3:46:02.000 --> 3:46:08.000]  It included the claim that Riyadh had provided 20% of the total funding to Hillary's campaign.
[3:46:08.000 --> 3:46:13.000]  Now they deleted that report, but however we have a screenshot of it.
[3:46:13.000 --> 3:46:16.000]  And if you look at that screenshot, it's very important.
[3:46:16.000 --> 3:46:22.000]  They say the important part of Prince Mohammed bin Salman's statements before traveling to America, this is their summary of it.
[3:46:22.000 --> 3:46:28.000]  This travel is to strengthen extensive economic relations, that kind of boilerplate language, okay?
[3:46:28.000 --> 3:46:30.000]  Are minor differences with America on some issues?
[3:46:30.000 --> 3:46:32.000]  Don't damage our rooted relations with America.
[3:46:32.000 --> 3:46:35.000]  The two countries are strategic allies so forth and so on.
[3:46:35.000 --> 3:46:39.000]  Saudi kings have always received necessary and sufficient support from the President of the United States.
[3:46:39.000 --> 3:46:44.000]  Yeah, like we put them in the catbird seat with the petrodollar, okay?
[3:46:44.000 --> 3:46:49.000]  They agreed to back up our worthless currency and we agreed to do anything for the Saudis.
[3:46:49.000 --> 3:46:56.000]  Then they go on to say this, Saudi Arabia has sponsored both Republican and Democrat Party of America in America.
[3:46:56.000 --> 3:46:59.000]  Current elections also provide with full enthusiasm.
[3:46:59.000 --> 3:47:01.000]  I'm reading this just as they wrote it.
[3:47:01.000 --> 3:47:05.000]  20% of the cost of Hillary Clinton's election, get that?
[3:47:05.000 --> 3:47:13.000]  20% of the cost of Hillary Clinton's election, even though some events in the country don't have a positive look to support a woman for presidency.
[3:47:13.000 --> 3:47:18.000]  You know, because the Saudis are all about women in leadership positions.
[3:47:18.000 --> 3:47:28.000]  I covered a report not long ago about how the women in Saudi Arabia went nuts over having one night a week in an amusement park
[3:47:28.000 --> 3:47:33.000]  where they could go in and wear regular clothes and not have to dress themselves in a shroud.
[3:47:33.000 --> 3:47:45.000]  And they could drive bumper cars because they can't get behind the wheel of a car outside of the little bumper car arena on ladies night.
[3:47:45.000 --> 3:47:51.000]  Okay, they could go in there, they could watch movies, they could dress normally, they could even drive a little bumper car.
[3:47:51.000 --> 3:47:58.000]  And they loved that release from a little bit of the pressure put on them by the religious police of Saudi Arabia.
[3:47:58.000 --> 3:48:03.000]  The people who, by the way, last year, that's that article, great job guys, you found that.
[3:48:03.000 --> 3:48:05.000]  Look at that, they're dressed in the burkas.
[3:48:05.000 --> 3:48:08.000]  But actually they don't have to dress in the burkas on ladies night.
[3:48:08.000 --> 3:48:11.000]  They can take off the burkas when they go around there, that little bit of freedom.
[3:48:11.000 --> 3:48:16.000]  You know, these are the people that are supporting Hillary Clinton.
[3:48:16.000 --> 3:48:18.000]  But she says it's just a conspiracy.
[3:48:18.000 --> 3:48:21.000]  Okay, there's no limit.
[3:48:21.000 --> 3:48:24.000]  The Trump campaign has never met a conspiracy theory it didn't like.
[3:48:24.000 --> 3:48:32.000]  Well, you know what, if you want to look at a conspiracy theory, again, go back and look at what Barack Obama did with Iransum.
[3:48:32.000 --> 3:48:34.000]  Okay, look at that.
[3:48:34.000 --> 3:48:45.000]  Now, as we're looking at some of this other news, while we're on Democrats here, okay, this is a breaking story that Michael Zimmerman gave me.
[3:48:45.000 --> 3:48:55.000]  That tip to Michael says, fresh off of his campaign to make socialism great again, Bernie Sanders buys a $600,000 summer house.
[3:48:55.000 --> 3:48:58.000]  Okay, understand, this is not his primary home.
[3:48:58.000 --> 3:49:00.000]  He's still going to keep his primary home.
[3:49:00.000 --> 3:49:05.000]  This is just a summer home that he just bought now that the campaign is over.
[3:49:05.000 --> 3:49:09.000]  And I look at this and it's like, well, you know, everybody's wondering, you know, what Bernie's price was.
[3:49:09.000 --> 3:49:19.000]  Was he threatened by the DNC in order to abandon his lifelong principles of socialism and endorse Hillary Clinton or was he bought off?
[3:49:19.000 --> 3:49:24.000]  You know, they give him a golden parachute or maybe a Goldman Sachs parachute.
[3:49:24.000 --> 3:49:30.000]  Is that where he came up with a $600,000 to buy a second home?
[3:49:30.000 --> 3:49:34.000]  You know, there you go, Bernie, champagne wishes and caviar dreams.
[3:49:34.000 --> 3:49:41.000]  This is a four bedroom, 500 foot beach front on Lake Champlain.
[3:49:41.000 --> 3:49:45.000]  Okay, it's on the east side of the island facing Vermont and not New York.
[3:49:45.000 --> 3:49:50.000]  And when I look at this, okay, this is, let me read you some of the tweets these people have.
[3:49:50.000 --> 3:49:57.000]  Man of the people, Bernie Sanders buys a $600,000 second summer home in Vermont.
[3:49:57.000 --> 3:50:00.000]  Another one, the socialist now has a summer home, LOL.
[3:50:00.000 --> 3:50:10.000]  Y'all got clowned as always. Another one, when you find out Bernie Sanders just used your $27 donations to buy himself a new summer home.
[3:50:10.000 --> 3:50:16.000]  Look, he was praising Daniel Ortega and the Sandinistas.
[3:50:16.000 --> 3:50:19.000]  Remember that 30 year old video when he went down there?
[3:50:19.000 --> 3:50:21.000]  He just couldn't say enough nice things about them.
[3:50:21.000 --> 3:50:25.000]  But you understand what Daniel Ortega and the Sandinistas did.
[3:50:25.000 --> 3:50:30.000]  I've been calling him this whole campaign, Bernie Sandinista, okay?
[3:50:30.000 --> 3:50:34.000]  And actually, I heard some of the Sanders people at the DNC call themselves Sandinistas.
[3:50:34.000 --> 3:50:38.000]  Daniel Ortega was a thief, he's a kleptocrat.
[3:50:38.000 --> 3:50:46.000]  He stole all the private property from people and as he was being driven out by a coalition of lefties and righties,
[3:50:46.000 --> 3:50:49.000]  he then privatized that again for himself.
[3:50:49.000 --> 3:50:52.000]  We saw the same thing happening with Hugo Chavez.
[3:50:52.000 --> 3:50:57.000]  They work for the bankers. Hugo Chavez gave them 700% return on their investment.
[3:50:57.000 --> 3:51:01.000]  Now we've got Bernie Sanders with a brand new $600,000 home.
[3:51:01.000 --> 3:51:08.000]  Extendivite, a seven herb combination of garlic, cayenne, hotthorn, bilberry, ginko bloba, balearion and milk thistle.
[3:51:08.000 --> 3:51:14.000]  Extendivite is designed to strengthen the heart and arteries and help the body heal itself.
[3:51:14.000 --> 3:51:20.000]  Doctors are not able to explain the improvements they are seeing in their patients' health who are taking Extendivite.
[3:51:20.000 --> 3:51:25.000]  People who once needed more pills are now taking less and getting better.
[3:51:25.000 --> 3:51:32.000]  Due to the unexplainable improvements in their patients' health, more doctors are calling to order Extendivite for themselves.
[3:51:32.000 --> 3:51:35.000]  Help Extendivite make your doctor a believer.
[3:51:35.000 --> 3:51:41.000]  Extendivite is available in capsule or liquid form for just $69.95 for a two-month supply.
[3:51:41.000 --> 3:51:53.000]  To get started, call 1-877-928-8822 that's 1-877-928-8822 or visit heartdrop.com.

[3:55:23.200 --> 3:55:28.800]  of the specials there as well as store-wide free shipping at InfowarsStore.com.
[3:55:28.800 --> 3:55:34.160]  Of course, we have this breaking story that I mentioned earlier from Mikhail Phelan. WikiLeaks
[3:55:34.160 --> 3:55:39.720]  is now offering a $20,000 reward for information on a murdered DNC staffer. There have been
[3:55:39.720 --> 3:55:46.360]  three people linked to the DNC who have died under questionable circumstances since these
[3:55:46.360 --> 3:55:50.260]  email leaks that affected the DNC. And of course, we've had a lot of people die under
[3:55:50.260 --> 3:55:54.840]  questionable circumstances with Hillary Clinton. Darren McBreen is working on a report right
[3:55:54.840 --> 3:56:00.400]  now about it. There are so many, as a matter of fact, to try to cut it down to the biggest
[3:56:00.400 --> 3:56:06.680]  ones is the problem. And of course, this guy who died, Seth Rich, it was immediately pronounced
[3:56:06.680 --> 3:56:12.680]  by the DC police chief, Kathy Lanier, who never met a gun control law she didn't want
[3:56:12.680 --> 3:56:18.560]  to enforce and extend. She immediately said, well, I think this is a robbery. Yet they
[3:56:18.560 --> 3:56:23.640]  didn't touch his wallet. They didn't touch his watch. They didn't take his phone. Nothing
[3:56:23.640 --> 3:56:29.320]  was taken from him. He was just beaten and shot. So WikiLeaks is not buying it. They
[3:56:29.320 --> 3:56:33.680]  want, they're offering a $20,000 reward for information about his murder.
[3:56:33.680 --> 3:56:39.080]  Now, in other news, we have a question by the New American. They ask, could an increase
[3:56:39.080 --> 3:56:43.720]  in gun ownership impact the election? This is a very interesting way to look at this.
[3:56:43.720 --> 3:56:47.760]  This is a John Lottz organization who said, during President Obama's administration, the
[3:56:47.760 --> 3:56:56.680]  number of concealed handgun permits has soared to over 14.5 million, a 215% increase since
[3:56:56.680 --> 3:57:03.800]  2007. More than 6% of the adult population now has a permit to carry concealed. Do you
[3:57:03.800 --> 3:57:10.160]  want to lose that right that you just newly discovered, folks? Because you will if Hillary
[3:57:10.160 --> 3:57:15.360]  Clinton gets elected. She will appoint judges all up and down, not just in the Supreme Court,
[3:57:15.360 --> 3:57:19.760]  but she will appoint judges everywhere to do everything she can to shut down your right
[3:57:19.760 --> 3:57:24.240]  to keep and bear arms. And they pointed out this from the Heritage Foundation. They also
[3:57:24.240 --> 3:57:30.320]  noted that the swing states have the biggest increase in the number of permits. Florida,
[3:57:30.320 --> 3:57:35.520]  for example, has 1.6 million. While Pennsylvania has 1.2. Ohio, Michigan, North Carolina each
[3:57:35.520 --> 3:57:39.600]  have more than a half million. Indiana has nearly three quarters of a million. These
[3:57:39.600 --> 3:57:45.440]  are all states that were carried by Obama in at least one of his last two elections.
[3:57:45.440 --> 3:57:53.120]  But then on the other hand, we have the federal civilian workforce has soared to 2.79 million
[3:57:53.120 --> 3:57:58.320]  just recently. We've had a massive uptick in the bureaucracy. You know who those people
[3:57:58.320 --> 3:58:02.400]  are going to be voting for. And don't forget when you look at this and you look at where
[3:58:02.400 --> 3:58:07.000]  we're headed, the disruptive technologies that are coming towards us. You're worried
[3:58:07.000 --> 3:58:12.480]  about the DNC hacks. Worry about them hacking your transportation. As I pointed out last
[3:58:12.480 --> 3:58:17.880]  night on the Nightly News, these hacks that they're demonstrating at DEFCON and Black Hat
[3:58:17.880 --> 3:58:23.480]  Conference, one of them with just off-the-shelf components with just a fish depth finder,
[3:58:23.480 --> 3:58:28.360]  they could completely blind a Tesla car. Turn it into, as one of those guys who said to
[3:58:28.360 --> 3:58:34.160]  me said, turn into Helen Keller on an Asgard track. Join us tonight for Nightly News, 7
[3:58:34.160 --> 3:58:49.120]  o'clock tomorrow at 8 p.m. Eastern.
