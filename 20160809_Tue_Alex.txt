[00:00:10.595 --> 00:00:14.637]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:00:14.637 --> 00:00:37.369]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:38.610]  Well, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:00:39.907 --> 00:00:45.288]  Everybody knows I don't engage in political hype or disinformation.
[00:00:45.288 --> 00:00:52.050]  I don't push narratives because I hope people will pick up on them.
[00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.671]  I push narratives when I know they're the truth.
[00:00:56.671 --> 00:00:59.951]  And when I know the globalists are scared of them.
[00:00:59.951 --> 00:01:03.732]  Let's let Dave Mustaine continue on for a moment.
[00:01:03.732 --> 00:01:06.593]  In my hour of need.
[00:01:06.593 --> 00:01:07.473]  No, you are not there.
[00:01:08.612 --> 00:01:24.163]  And though I reached out for you, Hillary, like a Greek tragedy, is stumbling, dying towards the great orb of power.
[00:01:24.163 --> 00:01:31.669]  She's always lusted after it, since she was a teenager, recruited by the CIA and the Ford Foundation.
[00:01:31.669 --> 00:01:33.490]  Then by MI6,
[00:01:38.647 --> 00:01:42.570]  You're not gonna get it, lady.
[00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.935]  And all your evil minions.
[00:01:47.935 --> 00:02:03.448]  And even if you steal the president, even if you attain the Oval Office, you will help bring down the New World Order magnificently.
[00:02:05.488 --> 00:02:09.209]  You think it's our darkest hour as you prepare to bring down the Republic?
[00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.972]  As you prepare to finally decapitate the United States of America?
[00:02:14.972 --> 00:02:24.675]  As you drug us to the mud and used us to carry out all your evil?
[00:02:24.675 --> 00:02:32.418]  There are more videos surfacing on a daily basis of her disintegration.
[00:02:34.284 --> 00:02:41.508]  They're running around with the tranquilizer pen to stop her from having her seizures.
[00:02:41.508 --> 00:02:48.311]  And every day she looks like she's deteriorating faster as God steps in.
[00:02:48.311 --> 00:02:57.456]  Like plagues visited upon Egypt and finally upon Pharaoh's house.
[00:02:57.456 --> 00:03:00.418]  You will only see it intensify, ladies and gentlemen, because
[00:03:01.516 --> 00:03:04.718]  This country has had Providence on its side, always has.
[00:03:04.718 --> 00:03:07.919]  This is a foreign globalist takeover.
[00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:19.385]  And there are still people that love God and love the Republic and love the great experiment that is this system.
[00:03:19.385 --> 00:03:24.147]  And so, as I say every day, it was the best of times, the worst of times.
[00:03:24.147 --> 00:03:26.989]  We have a dichotomy in front of us, in our hands.
[00:03:31.598 --> 00:03:36.622]  We have a parallel system.
[00:03:36.622 --> 00:03:40.005]  We are at that proverbial crossroads right now.
[00:03:40.005 --> 00:03:58.539]  And the rigging of Donald Trump's speeches where they cut live feeds, when he talks about Hillary being a communist Chinese agent, or he talks about Hillary being the founder of ISIS, which is a term I coined, I'm quite proud of that, which she is,
[00:03:59.619 --> 00:04:02.762]  I wouldn't call her the founder of ISIS if she wasn't the founder of ISIS.
[00:04:02.762 --> 00:04:07.546]  Look it up for yourself.
[00:04:07.546 --> 00:04:21.298]  And so now, we have more videos of her on the podium, at the stage, suddenly not knowing what planet she's on.
[00:04:21.298 --> 00:04:22.779]  Talk about judgment.
[00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:26.563]  But before we celebrate too much, and I don't normally celebrate people's ailments, but
[00:04:28.456 --> 00:04:37.443]  It's like God, you know, cursing Herod or something for the things he's done.
[00:04:37.443 --> 00:04:40.265]  I just don't want this great evil to be in full control of the nation.
[00:04:40.265 --> 00:04:52.535]  But at the same time, imagine her in the Oval Office as she degenerates and rots in front of everyone what she'll pull and what her handlers will pull.
[00:04:52.535 --> 00:04:56.918]  I mean, this is a very satanic move by the elite to put this witch in power.
[00:04:56.918 --> 00:04:57.359]  We'll be back.
[00:05:00.183 --> 00:05:02.384]  Joe Bates here with InfoWars.com.
[00:05:02.384 --> 00:05:04.864]  Communist Party unites behind Hillary.
[00:05:04.864 --> 00:05:11.986]  The Communist Party USA may not control many actual votes, but what they lack in support is made up for in enthusiasm.
[00:05:11.986 --> 00:05:18.587]  That passion was in full display with a seven-person team of reporters covering their National Political Convention last month.
[00:05:18.587 --> 00:05:25.749]  And their convention was a Democratic National Convention that nominated Hillary Clinton as their undisputed candidate for president.
[00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:29.510]  Here are some examples from the editorial produced as part of that coverage.
[00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:30.350]  By the team.
[00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.954]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and nutraceuticals.

[00:06:57.148 --> 00:06:58.469]  Check it out for yourself today.
[00:07:00.103 --> 00:07:02.065]  Dr. Grip, you developed Living Defense for us.
[00:07:02.065 --> 00:07:03.386]  It took you over a year to do it.
[00:07:03.386 --> 00:07:04.587]  Why is this so good?
[00:07:04.587 --> 00:07:09.872]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:07:09.872 --> 00:07:23.425]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[00:07:23.425 --> 00:07:24.786]  Right now with all the refugees,
[00:07:25.547 --> 00:07:27.208]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[00:07:27.208 --> 00:07:29.769]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[00:07:29.769 --> 00:07:31.090]  These are all parasites.
[00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:32.170]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:33.511]  There's so many things that are in it.
[00:07:33.511 --> 00:07:38.013]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[00:07:38.013 --> 00:07:41.194]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[00:07:41.254 --> 00:07:44.356]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[00:07:44.356 --> 00:07:45.417]  It just came back in yesterday.
[00:07:45.417 --> 00:07:47.338]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:47.338 --> 00:07:48.358]  And folks, you can't lose.
[00:07:48.358 --> 00:07:51.060]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:54.342]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:54.342 --> 00:07:56.583]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[00:07:56.583 --> 00:08:02.267]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[00:08:02.267 --> 00:08:03.728]  You have the power.
[00:08:03.728 --> 00:08:05.749]  Humanity has the power.
[00:08:05.749 --> 00:08:06.850]  We have the power.
[00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:08.171]  Do you want to fight?
[00:08:08.171 --> 00:08:10.252]  You better believe you got one!
[00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:17.598]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:08:17.598 --> 00:08:36.030]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:38.011]  It is Tuesday, the 9th day of August, 2000.
[00:08:38.011 --> 00:08:38.111]  And 16.
[00:08:42.918 --> 00:08:56.291]  We're only 91 days out right now from the 2016 presidential election that is undoubtedly the most important election in this nation's history.
[00:08:56.291 --> 00:09:01.396]  Hands down, it's not debatable.
[00:09:01.396 --> 00:09:03.799]  Whether you're talking about total control of the Supreme Court,
[00:09:05.683 --> 00:09:19.654]  Or whether you're talking about the future of our borders themselves, or the fact that we're going under international, multinational, unelected trade boards established by private corporations.
[00:09:19.654 --> 00:09:30.502]  The all-out attack on language, the all-out attack on the family, the all-out attack on normal human activity and agrarian farming activities.
[00:09:32.332 --> 00:09:33.774]  Look at DrugsReport.com.
[00:09:33.774 --> 00:09:34.574]  It says it all.
[00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:45.366]  This morning, I was doing research for the show, and I said to myself, when I get in today, I've got to have them make a bunch of liners that have Twilight Zone music.
[00:09:45.366 --> 00:09:47.708]  I mean, we already have that, but I want liners.
[00:09:47.708 --> 00:09:52.613]  In fact, I even started telling them to bring this last night, but I definitely want it now.
[00:09:53.496 --> 00:09:55.697]  That just has the countdown every day.
[00:09:55.697 --> 00:09:57.237]  91 days.
[00:09:57.237 --> 00:09:58.358]  90 days.
[00:09:58.358 --> 00:10:01.899]  With Twilight Zone music playing in the background.
[00:10:01.899 --> 00:10:03.359]  Because it's the only way to describe it.
[00:10:03.359 --> 00:10:05.000]  That's what this is.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.781]  Every day it becomes more Twilight Zone.
[00:10:09.781 --> 00:10:11.922]  And then I go to DrugsReport.com.
[00:10:11.922 --> 00:10:13.722]  Twilight Zone.
[00:10:13.722 --> 00:10:14.703]  Orlando.
[00:10:14.703 --> 00:10:16.963]  Terrorist Dad.
[00:10:16.963 --> 00:10:20.124]  For Clinton.
[00:10:20.124 --> 00:10:22.285]  Cheers Hillary at Rally.
[00:10:23.829 --> 00:10:31.054]  Said God will punish gays, supported Taliban.
[00:10:31.054 --> 00:10:35.036]  Now this isn't his dad saying this 20, 30 years ago in Afghanistan.
[00:10:35.036 --> 00:10:42.381]  This is his dad has a YouTube show in Arabic, in Pashtun.
[00:10:42.381 --> 00:10:48.245]  And his son went to the mosque where they preached on video, we have the clips, in English.
[00:10:49.028 --> 00:10:51.450]  Because we love the homosexuals.
[00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:52.731]  We kill them.
[00:10:52.731 --> 00:10:57.154]  It is the humane thing to do for Allah.
[00:10:57.154 --> 00:11:01.798]  Some weird creepoid imam.
[00:11:01.798 --> 00:11:04.199]  And then they invert reality and blame Donald Trump.
[00:11:04.199 --> 00:11:09.203]  I mean, it's all Twilight Zone.
[00:11:09.203 --> 00:11:10.024]  Because that's what it is.
[00:11:15.987 --> 00:11:20.069]  And his dad is at the rally with this big yellow sign praising Hillary.
[00:11:20.069 --> 00:11:37.517]  Twilight Zone, Orlando terrorist dad for Clinton, cheers Hillary at rally, said God will punish gays, supported Taliban.
[00:11:37.517 --> 00:11:39.959]  And he's there on the local news, on local NBC,
[00:11:41.089 --> 00:11:44.851]  Hillary Clinton makes the biggest investments since World War II.
[00:11:44.851 --> 00:11:46.331]  Good for national security.
[00:11:46.331 --> 00:11:48.612]  Ex-CIA chief.
[00:11:48.612 --> 00:11:49.132]  Morrell.
[00:11:49.132 --> 00:11:51.613]  Hillary told the truth about Benghazi.
[00:11:51.613 --> 00:11:53.154]  Gun control laws.
[00:11:53.154 --> 00:12:00.557]  Here's this guy with his whole family running refugee programs.
[00:12:00.557 --> 00:12:02.338]  The father-in-law of the shooter.
[00:12:02.338 --> 00:12:03.438]  Remember?
[00:12:03.438 --> 00:12:04.319]  The Pulse nightclub.
[00:12:04.319 --> 00:12:07.320]  50-something dad.
[00:12:11.792 --> 00:12:16.895]  And then you never even hear apologies out of this guy's mouth.
[00:12:16.895 --> 00:12:21.838]  And then he's in an Orlando suburb at a Hillary rally.
[00:12:21.838 --> 00:12:24.260]  But wait, it gets worse.
[00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:36.407]  Infowars.com shows video of Hillary with only 171 people turning up for her rally in Florida.
[00:12:39.033 --> 00:12:50.065]  In an empty aircraft hangar, but the press crops the photos to make it look like she has a giant audience.
[00:12:50.065 --> 00:12:52.908]  Media photoshops Hillary crowd to make her audience look bigger.
[00:12:52.908 --> 00:12:56.292]  Only 171 people turn up for Clinton's rally in Florida.
[00:12:56.292 --> 00:12:58.594]  They crop it.
[00:12:58.594 --> 00:13:00.877]  And in the crowd behind her,
[00:13:03.843 --> 00:13:12.727]  Is Sadiq Mateen, father of Omar Mateen, the Pulse nightclub mass murderer, who has nothing to do with Islam.
[00:13:12.727 --> 00:13:14.748]  Oh, look, Al Qaeda just hit again.
[00:13:14.748 --> 00:13:17.490]  Oh, look, ISIS just hit again.
[00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:22.012]  Yesterday, hundreds killed in different suicide bombings in the Middle East and Central Asia.
[00:13:22.012 --> 00:13:25.274]  And it's like, oh, ISIS hits again?
[00:13:25.274 --> 00:13:27.575]  That's the group that has nothing to do with Islam.
[00:13:31.345 --> 00:13:35.781]  Here is the shooter's father talking about how wonderful Hillary is.
[00:13:36.601 --> 00:13:41.244]  Hillary Clinton speaking to a crowd in Kissimmee, just south of Orlando.
[00:13:41.244 --> 00:13:46.807]  Supposed to be talking jobs, but started off paying tribute to those affected by the Pulse nightclub shooting.
[00:13:46.807 --> 00:13:53.552]  And I know how many people, family members, loved ones and friends are still grieving.
[00:13:53.552 --> 00:13:59.055]  Notice the man right behind Secretary Clinton with the mustache and wearing a red hat.
[00:13:59.055 --> 00:14:01.377]  That's the father of the Orlando shooter.
[00:14:02.765 --> 00:14:08.150]  Just hours later, by chance, we ran into him at a rest stop on the way back to West Palm Beach.
[00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:12.635]  Clinton is good for United States versus Donald Trump.
[00:14:12.635 --> 00:14:17.380]  He wanted to do an interview and showed us a sign he made for Hillary Clinton.
[00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.662]  So tell us why you wanted to stop and talk now.
[00:14:19.662 --> 00:14:20.583]  Hit pause.
[00:14:20.583 --> 00:14:21.164]  Just stop.
[00:14:21.164 --> 00:14:22.385]  Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[00:14:26.505 --> 00:14:28.266]  Why does Drudge call this Twilight Zone?
[00:14:28.266 --> 00:14:35.671]  Why was I yesterday telling crew I want Twilight Zone intros and outros for the election?
[00:14:35.671 --> 00:14:48.440]  And I want to be able to tailor them every day that has new weirdness that's going on, new bizarreness, and then finally have a big compendium one that's like 10 minutes long right before the election of just all the insanity.
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.280]  On day 91, this happened.
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:50.141]  On day 90, this happened.
[00:14:50.141 --> 00:14:51.422]  On day 90 or 89, this happened.
[00:14:56.750 --> 00:15:12.881]  On day 91, the Orlando mass murderer, Islamist's dad, shows up for Clinton, and it only gets weirder from there.
[00:15:12.881 --> 00:15:23.548]  Just like Khan, oh, the poor person whose son died in Iraq, who set up a Sharia law
[00:15:26.187 --> 00:15:45.398]  Law Journal and Law Center to integrate Sharia law, specifically as its founding mission, over Western jurisprudence, which is a merger of European and Anglo-Saxon common law and Jewish law.
[00:15:45.398 --> 00:15:46.699]  That's what it is.
[00:15:46.699 --> 00:15:49.821]  And the two are so close, that's why they integrated so well.
[00:15:49.821 --> 00:15:51.922]  Not the same as Islamic law.
[00:15:51.922 --> 00:15:55.724]  And what we're sitting here looking at is total crazy land.
[00:15:59.346 --> 00:16:01.428]  I mean, we are overrun.
[00:16:01.428 --> 00:16:10.457]  I used to hear ten years ago by people, they're putting Islamists instead of the FBI and CIA and NSA and the military, and they're putting them in as police chiefs all over Europe, and they're going to take over with them!
[00:16:10.457 --> 00:16:12.599]  I'm like, oh shut up!
[00:16:12.599 --> 00:16:20.326]  I know there's a lot of radical Muslims and bad stuff over there, but we shouldn't be stirring them up, and we shouldn't be over there, and, you know, this is all exaggerated to take our rights away.
[00:16:21.488 --> 00:16:33.351]  I didn't know that they were actually setting them up to basically take over and be the enforcers and henchmen because they'll just go blow themselves up or kill themselves for the establishment anytime they're given an order to do it.
[00:16:33.351 --> 00:16:39.333]  The liberals have finally found their army.
[00:16:39.333 --> 00:16:42.313]  And of course they're not liberals.
[00:16:42.313 --> 00:16:49.035]  And then indicative, emblematic, archetypal, illustrative,
[00:16:51.857 --> 00:16:53.778]  Declarative.
[00:16:53.778 --> 00:16:55.218]  Underlining.
[00:16:55.218 --> 00:16:56.759]  Emblazoning.
[00:16:56.759 --> 00:17:01.940]  Spotlighting.
[00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:05.822]  The rotting establishment is Hillary in bozo land.
[00:17:05.822 --> 00:17:11.684]  There's a new video, we're going to hit you after the break, of her on the campaign trail just totally forgetting
[00:17:12.523 --> 00:17:18.906]  Who she is and just just like my grandmother who's 91 until about a year ago was always there.
[00:17:18.906 --> 00:17:25.488]  Sometimes you'll be a go visitor and she'll just suddenly for about a minute not know who she is and then suddenly she's right back.
[00:17:25.488 --> 00:17:34.672]  Hillary Clinton is now doing this on TV everywhere she goes and stumbling around and looks like a bag lady.
[00:17:34.672 --> 00:17:36.433]  She doesn't just look old.
[00:17:36.433 --> 00:17:39.434]  I wouldn't care if she was 70 years old and knew what she was doing.
[00:17:39.434 --> 00:17:40.234]  80 years old.
[00:17:40.234 --> 00:17:42.135]  It's that she is daughtering.
[00:17:45.196 --> 00:17:51.799]  Phyllis Schlafly, at what, 90 years old, is more together than Hillary Clinton.
[00:17:51.799 --> 00:17:53.519]  When you see her give a speech.
[00:17:53.519 --> 00:17:58.041]  Her body's frail, but her brain is still 95% there.
[00:17:58.041 --> 00:18:01.703]  Compared to the incredible intellect she was, she's now just an intellect.
[00:18:01.703 --> 00:18:02.743]  A strong intellect.
[00:18:02.743 --> 00:18:05.564]  Hillary is gone.
[00:18:05.564 --> 00:18:08.425]  Ain't there, ladies and gentlemen, whacked out of her brain.
[00:18:08.425 --> 00:18:11.567]  And you can tell she's on drugs, speed, you name it.
[00:18:11.567 --> 00:18:14.808]  That's why she can get charged up and just be all angry.
[00:18:16.152 --> 00:18:25.034]  That's why she can't have press conferences, that's why she's like, I'm sorry, I got short-circuited, oh Benghazi, oh, I mean, her first press conference in a year.
[00:18:25.034 --> 00:18:30.996]  And then, you've got this guy, who doesn't even have any shame.
[00:18:30.996 --> 00:18:34.677]  Here's the big issue.
[00:18:34.677 --> 00:18:42.399]  Omar Mateen's daddy, Sadiq, the famous Taliban jihadi, brought over here by the CIA in the late 1980s,
[00:18:45.469 --> 00:18:54.713]  This is all, he's driving around in his Mercedes, his modern Mercedes, and getting out of his $85,000 car to hold up his Hillary sign.
[00:18:54.713 --> 00:18:58.795]  What on earth is going on here?
[00:18:58.795 --> 00:19:10.701]  Orlando terrorist father cheers at Hillary Clinton rally, calls for gun control, when his son had a homeland security clearance and legal guns.
[00:19:10.701 --> 00:19:13.542]  I mean, under his system, under his beliefs, I'm skipping the break.
[00:19:14.483 --> 00:19:17.725]  Under all of that, network break.
[00:19:17.725 --> 00:19:24.888]  I can do it.
[00:19:24.888 --> 00:19:32.472]  In fact, I'm going to be honest, before I punched up Drudge and saw that, I was going to come on air and say I almost can't even do this show anymore.
[00:19:32.472 --> 00:19:40.216]  I'm going to skip this break, guys.
[00:19:40.216 --> 00:19:42.417]  We'll go out with the next segment with Twilight Zone.
[00:19:43.646 --> 00:20:01.586]  Because it's getting so crazy that it's almost like even sitting up here on air and laughing at all this and playing videos and saying what's coming next almost turns us into sick spectators who are tied down watching little demons eat our toes off.
[00:20:02.793 --> 00:20:07.076]  And we're like, look at that little demon, he just ate my big toe and now he's chewing at my heel.
[00:20:07.076 --> 00:20:08.898]  Oh look, I'm bleeding all over the table.
[00:20:08.898 --> 00:20:12.941]  Oh another one just climbed up and I'm chained down and oh look, they're fighting with each other.
[00:20:12.941 --> 00:20:14.282]  Look how evil they are.
[00:20:14.282 --> 00:20:18.925]  Doesn't matter, we're chained down with them eating our feet.
[00:20:18.925 --> 00:20:25.891]  Now they're metaphorically climbing up with sewing needles and jamming them in our eyes.
[00:20:28.257 --> 00:20:30.578]  And we're like, ha ha ha, look at this country!
[00:20:30.578 --> 00:20:36.361]  It'll never wake up when we're all the body politic being attacked, being diseased, being overrun.
[00:20:36.361 --> 00:20:50.767]  Do you know how over the top it is to bring in millions of people a year over the southern border alone that have diseases like TB and black plague and leprosy, which have now made comebacks.
[00:20:50.767 --> 00:20:52.608]  They were eradicated.
[00:20:52.608 --> 00:20:56.030]  Black plague, bubonic plague, wet leprosy,
[00:20:57.222 --> 00:21:02.864]  It's now, they're having to set up leper colonies in Texas and Florida.
[00:21:02.864 --> 00:21:08.025]  And the CDC tries to keep them quiet, but they're there!
[00:21:08.025 --> 00:21:11.426]  Leper colonies, boys and girls!
[00:21:11.426 --> 00:21:21.269]  They'll let people in, and there's the Border Patrol with their gloves and their masks, because I've talked to them, and then this is listed in the literature, and they're like, oh, this guy's got wet leprosy!
[00:21:21.269 --> 00:21:24.109]  Nose rotting off!
[00:21:24.109 --> 00:21:25.730]  They don't give them medical treatment!
[00:21:26.974 --> 00:21:29.495]  They let them in.
[00:21:29.495 --> 00:21:33.616]  But forget leprosy, that's still rare.
[00:21:33.616 --> 00:21:48.500]  Drug-resistant TB, where the antibiotics that might be able to control it, not get rid of it, cause liver failure and kidney failure in most people within two or three uses.
[00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:55.482]  They're taking them and putting them in high schools, and middle schools, and elementary schools, and colleges all over the country.
[00:21:56.897 --> 00:21:58.538]  And not even testing them.
[00:21:58.538 --> 00:22:00.700]  Oh, but don't worry.
[00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:09.227]  The high schools and colleges want to make you take 50-something vaccines, including meningitis vaccines, that have been linked to all sorts of medical problems.
[00:22:09.227 --> 00:22:10.308]  That's okay.
[00:22:10.308 --> 00:22:13.811]  And upwards of 22% of the refugees have TB now.
[00:22:13.811 --> 00:22:16.693]  That's Associated Press.
[00:22:16.693 --> 00:22:17.834]  And they don't even test them.
[00:22:17.834 --> 00:22:19.055]  That'd be culturally rude.
[00:22:19.055 --> 00:22:20.516]  Because then what will we do with you?
[00:22:20.516 --> 00:22:22.258]  No, come here, Akeem Ali.
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:36.383]  Whatever their name is, come here and sit right down next to little Jenny.
[00:22:36.383 --> 00:22:36.684]  Why?
[00:22:36.684 --> 00:22:38.984]  Why?
[00:22:38.984 --> 00:22:41.985]  Why?
[00:22:41.985 --> 00:22:45.167]  Because they're at war with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:22:45.167 --> 00:22:50.989]  The globalists are bringing down the West as we speak.
[00:22:50.989 --> 00:22:55.190]  The bare minimum is you would give treatment to these poor souls, like they did at Ellis Island.
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:59.422]  Statue of Liberty.
[00:22:59.422 --> 00:23:05.667]  Oh, you got to come in, but you got cured of your disease first or shipped back.
[00:23:05.667 --> 00:23:10.110]  You mean you're tired, you're hungry, you're diseased?
[00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:13.413]  So.
[00:23:13.413 --> 00:23:14.534]  This is the arrogance.
[00:23:14.534 --> 00:23:19.217]  Let's back that local NBC newscast up.
[00:23:19.217 --> 00:23:21.799]  At least they saw the horror and the bizarreness of it.
[00:23:21.799 --> 00:23:23.801]  National media is like, well, see, he cares.
[00:23:23.801 --> 00:23:24.862]  He wants gun control.
[00:23:24.862 --> 00:23:25.982]  He's sorry for what his son did.
[00:23:25.982 --> 00:23:26.403]  No, he's not.
[00:23:28.459 --> 00:23:38.429]  He's there as a jihadi, who has his own YouTube show, who pushes Sharia law and everything that the imam, that his son-in-law was saying.
[00:23:38.429 --> 00:23:41.753]  And it's outrageous that the media never made an issue of his dad!
[00:23:41.753 --> 00:23:43.575]  And why hasn't he been deported?
[00:23:43.575 --> 00:23:46.958]  Deport his Taliban butt!
[00:23:46.958 --> 00:23:49.821]  Oh no, that would be mean.
[00:23:49.821 --> 00:23:51.363]  So now he's so arrogant.
[00:23:52.301 --> 00:23:56.845]  And on such a power trip, because, you know, Trump's 15 points behind now.
[00:23:56.845 --> 00:23:57.526]  Why not make it 20?
[00:23:57.526 --> 00:23:59.307]  We can put the graph back there.
[00:23:59.307 --> 00:24:01.489]  Why not say he's 3,000 points behind?
[00:24:01.489 --> 00:24:03.551]  You could only be 100 points behind.
[00:24:03.551 --> 00:24:06.153]  Folks would know that was impossible, though.
[00:24:06.153 --> 00:24:12.299]  So they're going to tell you, oh, Trump's 15 points, 12 points, why Fox News has had the little coup now.
[00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:16.201]  Well, they got rid of Roger Ailes, so they're not even going to have scientific polls there.
[00:24:16.201 --> 00:24:27.865]  They have their new news director on this morning, and he was saying, oh yes, there's a lot of fake polls that show Trump neck and neck, but the real polls show her about 12 points ahead.
[00:24:27.865 --> 00:24:29.885]  And that's where she's going to win.
[00:24:29.885 --> 00:24:33.206]  So, Trump is going to lose.
[00:24:33.206 --> 00:24:37.888]  And Hemmer and the other anchor were like, okay, well thank you for that information.
[00:24:38.868 --> 00:24:43.571]  So we put up our new poll here, this is the new Hillary Clinton poll, MSNBC poll.
[00:24:43.571 --> 00:24:52.116]  Another new poll shows that she was 10 points ahead, then she was, let me look at it here, 347 points, 800 and something points.
[00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:58.002]  1,465 points, then 2,727 points, and then 3,435 points is where she is today.
[00:24:58.002 --> 00:25:00.604]  On the 9th of August, 2016, she is 3,435 points ahead.
[00:25:00.604 --> 00:25:02.065]  And it's scientific, I said so, okay?
[00:25:02.065 --> 00:25:03.186]  Also, she had 20,000 people in Orlando.
[00:25:03.186 --> 00:25:05.308]  That's what the news has been reporting.
[00:25:22.827 --> 00:25:24.948]  Now, I'm going to show you the reality here.
[00:25:24.948 --> 00:25:27.849]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:25:27.849 --> 00:25:28.930]  It's still linked on Drudge.
[00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:30.331]  I saw it on Drudge this morning as well.
[00:25:30.331 --> 00:25:32.652]  Folks can go there and see it.
[00:25:32.652 --> 00:25:37.454]  And if you're radio listeners, you should go see this and you should send this on to folks.
[00:25:37.454 --> 00:25:41.296]  Media photoshops Hillary Crowd to make her audience look bigger.
[00:25:42.779 --> 00:25:47.002]  And they cropped it in, and then also added and repeated some of the people in there.
[00:25:47.002 --> 00:25:48.443]  And why not?
[00:25:48.443 --> 00:25:50.844]  I mean, they're fighting an evil racist.
[00:25:50.844 --> 00:25:51.825]  So, it's okay.
[00:25:51.825 --> 00:25:53.286]  Why not just beef that crowd up?
[00:25:53.286 --> 00:25:55.047]  Crop it and beef it.
[00:25:55.047 --> 00:25:56.548]  In reality, look at that.
[00:25:56.548 --> 00:25:57.609]  No one.
[00:25:57.609 --> 00:25:58.529]  No one.
[00:25:58.529 --> 00:25:59.730]  In fact, they're saying that's 150-something?
[00:25:59.730 --> 00:25:59.770]  171?
[00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:00.571]  That isn't even that!
[00:26:00.571 --> 00:26:00.811]  Good Lord!
[00:26:09.858 --> 00:26:16.982]  This is what she has all over the country, where Sanders would have 5,000, 20,000, 30,000, she would have 1,000 max!
[00:26:16.982 --> 00:26:19.783]  We've been at the rallies where she'd have 1,000 people!
[00:26:19.783 --> 00:26:20.784]  It'd be on the news!
[00:26:20.784 --> 00:26:23.145]  More than 20,000 showed up to see Hillary!
[00:26:23.145 --> 00:26:26.847]  This is total state-run media!
[00:26:26.847 --> 00:26:28.928]  And it makes my head spin.
[00:26:28.928 --> 00:26:31.549]  Let's go back to Omar Mateen.
[00:26:31.549 --> 00:26:33.270]  Killed 50-plus people.
[00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:34.671]  Here's his daddy, Sadiq.
[00:26:36.169 --> 00:26:36.389]  Impossible.
[00:26:57.170 --> 00:27:11.396]  I cannot believe he has the nerve, again, to go to a rally where she's invoking the dead, ignoring Islam's involvement, and then he has the nerve to blame our Second Amendment, our birthright, because he wants his quarry disarmed.
[00:27:11.396 --> 00:27:12.557]  He wants his demi.
[00:27:12.557 --> 00:27:17.339]  That's when the Muslims start taking over, the subgroups have to pay tribute, and that's what we've become.
[00:27:18.646 --> 00:27:23.408]  Meanwhile, at the Olympics, we get to see the Brazilian volleyball team.
[00:27:23.408 --> 00:27:30.131]  Oh my God, those women are just... I think Brazilian women, maybe Eastern European, I don't know, but they're hot.
[00:27:30.131 --> 00:27:34.853]  Mexican TV stars, I mean, I'm just appreciating God's creations.
[00:27:34.853 --> 00:27:36.254]  I mean, can't we all?
[00:27:36.254 --> 00:27:41.957]  You've got juxtaposed the Egyptian women totally covered up in Teletubby uniforms.
[00:27:42.964 --> 00:27:46.707]  Just like in Europe, they're banning water parks, you know, wearing bikinis, you gotta wear burqa outfits.
[00:27:46.707 --> 00:27:48.749]  That's actually happening.
[00:27:48.749 --> 00:28:00.078]  And we've got the German team, they look really good too, the Brazilian team, that's what I like, it's athletic, God's creations, that's the way to go.
[00:28:00.078 --> 00:28:03.781]  And then you've got the poor Muslim women in their hooded outfits.
[00:28:03.781 --> 00:28:05.082]  I mean, I really feel sorry for them.
[00:28:05.956 --> 00:28:07.497]  I really, really do.
[00:28:07.497 --> 00:28:12.659]  But the particular one with the Brazilian team, it's something else.
[00:28:12.659 --> 00:28:14.600]  I mean, look at those goddesses.
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:18.682]  God's creation, and then you've got next to them these poor women having to cover themselves up.
[00:28:18.682 --> 00:28:20.623]  I'm going to stop right there, please.
[00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:30.164]  Let's go back to Mr. Taliban, who has his own YouTube channel, his own YouTube show.
[00:28:30.164 --> 00:28:31.705]  Agreeing with everything, basically his son posts.
[00:28:31.705 --> 00:28:33.526]  Here it is.
[00:28:33.526 --> 00:28:35.568]  Why I stopped to talk to you?
[00:28:35.568 --> 00:28:40.372]  Because it's very important for the United States of America, especially the election.
[00:28:40.372 --> 00:28:42.774]  I was invited by the Democratic Party.
[00:28:43.254 --> 00:28:50.500]  Just like a come support Hillary, just a regular chain email or a personal invitation?
[00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:57.325]  So it came out, I'm a member, so as a member I get the invitation, nothing particular about it.
[00:28:57.325 --> 00:29:06.892]  What went into your decision about going to this event right near Orlando where this Pulse nightclub shooting happened?
[00:29:06.892 --> 00:29:09.174]  I wish we, because I spoke a lot about that.
[00:29:10.049 --> 00:29:18.977]  And I wish that my son joined the army and fought ISIS and destroyed ISIS.
[00:29:18.977 --> 00:29:20.498]  That would be much better.
[00:29:20.498 --> 00:29:27.104]  Did Hillary Clinton's campaign know that you were going to that event and sitting right directly behind her?
[00:29:27.104 --> 00:29:31.507]  It's a democratic party, so everybody can join.
[00:29:31.507 --> 00:29:38.053]  Do you think that some people will be surprised to know that you were there in Orlando or near Orlando?
[00:29:38.869 --> 00:29:41.292]  Why they should be surprised?
[00:29:41.292 --> 00:29:42.473]  We'll be back, we'll be back.
[00:29:42.473 --> 00:29:44.795]  It's just I can't handle it.
[00:29:44.795 --> 00:29:46.717]  Oh my gosh, I just can't handle it anymore.
[00:29:46.717 --> 00:29:49.020]  These people are crazy.
[00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:52.964]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.964 --> 00:29:55.667]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.239 --> 00:30:03.441]  This is Ashley Beckford for InfoWars.com.
[00:30:03.441 --> 00:30:05.042]  This is your tip of the week.
[00:30:05.042 --> 00:30:07.163]  Article from Mercola.com.
[00:30:07.163 --> 00:30:11.405]  Fluoride, the only drug intentionally added to your tap water.
[00:30:11.405 --> 00:30:20.210]  Fluoride is an endocrine-disrupting, neurotoxic, and bone-weakening substance that the FDA defines as a drug when used to prevent disease.
[00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:26.373]  Because unlike the minerals we need, humans have no known physiological requirement for fluoride.
[00:30:26.593 --> 00:30:34.737]  Sodium fluoride, long known as an effective roach poison, is added to tablets and drops for the purpose of preventing tooth decay.
[00:30:34.737 --> 00:30:38.359]  In short, sodium fluoride is not a nutritional supplement.
[00:30:38.359 --> 00:30:41.521]  It is a prescription drug, and a dangerous one.
[00:30:41.521 --> 00:30:53.227]  FDA recently announced that marketing fluoride drops and tablets for cavity prevention violates federal law because FDA never approved these products as either safe or effective.
[00:30:53.507 --> 00:30:55.108]  Don't use fluoride.
[00:30:55.108 --> 00:31:00.051]  Use the Alexa Pure Water Filter to remove contaminants from your water supply.
[00:31:00.051 --> 00:31:06.754]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[00:31:06.754 --> 00:31:09.416]  Dr. Grip, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[00:31:09.756 --> 00:31:15.402]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[00:31:15.402 --> 00:31:21.509]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[00:31:21.509 --> 00:31:24.792]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[00:31:24.792 --> 00:31:26.474]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[00:31:26.474 --> 00:31:30.779]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[00:31:30.779 --> 00:31:31.760]  It's one of the most effective
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:33.701]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[00:31:33.701 --> 00:31:35.381]  It works like an antioxidant.
[00:31:35.381 --> 00:31:38.803]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[00:31:38.803 --> 00:31:41.404]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[00:31:41.404 --> 00:31:42.464]  It's in powder form.
[00:31:42.464 --> 00:31:45.185]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[00:31:45.185 --> 00:31:46.066]  I take this.
[00:31:46.066 --> 00:31:47.886]  This is the product that I take.

[00:32:57.266 --> 00:33:16.193]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:33.606 --> 00:33:42.569]  Imagine being the mainstream media and basically going to meetings with the Attorney General at the time, Eric Holder.
[00:33:42.569 --> 00:33:45.731]  We're at an RTF banquet, national meeting.
[00:33:45.731 --> 00:33:48.091]  It's on C-SPAN.
[00:33:48.091 --> 00:33:53.794]  And he gets up and he says, listen, it's not enough to just sometimes go out with the Second Amendment to repeal it.
[00:33:53.794 --> 00:33:56.795]  I want you to hammer it every segment constantly.
[00:33:56.795 --> 00:33:58.575]  I want brainwashing.
[00:33:58.575 --> 00:33:59.976]  I want brainwashing.
[00:34:02.947 --> 00:34:18.343]  And you fast forward to today, that's why, and I keep going back to this because it's so central, and I'm going to put a special report together on this, showing Gruber and showing the State Department head spokesman we played yesterday and all these others.
[00:34:20.968 --> 00:34:32.812]  Gibbs and others, where they just make jokes about, yeah, we lie to the filth, and they're so stupid, and it's so much fun to screw them, and triple their prices!
[00:34:32.812 --> 00:34:43.836]  Oh, we've got some young college kids here learning about truth and justice and democracy!
[00:34:43.836 --> 00:34:47.257]  And then you've got total weirdo behavior.
[00:34:49.258 --> 00:34:59.625]  With this guy obviously out of his mind, in my view, Sadiq Mateen, his son killed 50 plus people.
[00:34:59.625 --> 00:35:10.393]  They're like, do you think it's a little weird you're here with Hillary and, you know, your son and all the rest of this, and she's having a memorial for the dead, pushing down control, and you're, you're here.
[00:35:10.393 --> 00:35:12.995]  No, nothing weird, no, no, no.
[00:35:12.995 --> 00:35:18.219]  You know, don't show your face, buddy, unless you're there apologizing.
[00:35:20.708 --> 00:35:23.909]  But no, he has a YouTube show.
[00:35:23.909 --> 00:35:25.589]  He does radio and TV interviews.
[00:35:25.589 --> 00:35:33.471]  We've played them in Pashtun with translations saying the same crap his son said.
[00:35:33.471 --> 00:35:46.074]  And I'll tell you what's so whacked out about these freaks is it's been confirmed the son had a whole bunch of homosexual encounters and was running around on those apps going wild.
[00:35:50.609 --> 00:35:53.170]  Talk about total mental patients!
[00:35:53.170 --> 00:35:54.990]  People say, well see that's not Islam, see?
[00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:56.850]  That's why he was conflicted.
[00:35:56.850 --> 00:35:58.591]  No, that's what they do in Islam!
[00:35:58.591 --> 00:36:03.532]  It has the highest rates of homosexual sex!
[00:36:03.532 --> 00:36:09.193]  Look it up!
[00:36:09.193 --> 00:36:14.134]  Do people know that Islam pushes that black people aren't humans?
[00:36:16.246 --> 00:36:18.408]  And calls them raisin heads?
[00:36:18.408 --> 00:36:20.290]  I don't want to get off on some jag about Islam.
[00:36:20.290 --> 00:36:22.392]  I knew all this stuff 20 years ago.
[00:36:22.392 --> 00:36:22.733]  Okay?
[00:36:22.733 --> 00:36:25.095]  But I wasn't wanting to have a clash of civilizations.
[00:36:25.095 --> 00:36:26.677]  I wasn't wanting to go down this path.
[00:36:26.677 --> 00:36:28.899]  I know a lot of these people just want to reform.
[00:36:28.899 --> 00:36:32.843]  And, you know, Christianity and some of its past has been barbaric as well.
[00:36:32.843 --> 00:36:34.465]  People have used it, misappropriated it.
[00:36:34.465 --> 00:36:35.146]  I get it, okay?
[00:36:37.418 --> 00:36:49.526]  But the brand of Islam we've got running us over right now is super screwed up and incredibly oppressive and illiberal.
[00:36:49.526 --> 00:36:51.528]  Anti-liberal.
[00:36:51.528 --> 00:37:03.676]  And I just want to indict the Democratic Party, and I want to indict all of you that are apologists for Islam, because you really are bad people.
[00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:09.222]  And they're so arrogant and so disconnected.
[00:37:09.222 --> 00:37:20.687]  As far as I could look, maybe I'm wrong, but weren't there national issues that Omar Mateen's dad, Sadiq, never really apologized?
[00:37:20.687 --> 00:37:24.529]  Kind of like in this newscast on NBC Local.
[00:37:24.529 --> 00:37:26.210]  In Orlando.
[00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:29.091]  He's come down from New York for this.
[00:37:32.523 --> 00:37:33.885]  And he's there.
[00:37:33.885 --> 00:37:35.927]  He's not even from there.
[00:37:35.927 --> 00:37:37.389]  Last time I checked.
[00:37:37.389 --> 00:37:40.192]  And he goes, oh, I wish he wouldn't have done what he did.
[00:37:40.192 --> 00:37:42.455]  I wish he would have gone and killed ISIS instead.
[00:37:42.455 --> 00:37:45.558]  That would have been better.
[00:37:45.558 --> 00:37:49.783]  So some half-ass apology, excuse me, I don't want to use French here, I apologize.
[00:37:52.551 --> 00:37:56.073]  I was kind of having a Hillary moment last time when they said, hey boss, are you mad or something?
[00:37:56.073 --> 00:37:57.174]  Because you had your head down.
[00:37:57.174 --> 00:37:57.935]  That's what I do when I get mad.
[00:37:57.935 --> 00:38:01.897]  And I'm like, no, I do not know how to respond to this anymore.
[00:38:01.897 --> 00:38:04.819]  I have hit a wall with weirdness.
[00:38:04.819 --> 00:38:07.341]  Hillary obviously is completely insane.
[00:38:07.341 --> 00:38:10.623]  She obviously has trouble standing straight up.
[00:38:10.623 --> 00:38:12.584]  She comes back to debates late.
[00:38:12.584 --> 00:38:16.547]  She looks like she's wearing a diaper.
[00:38:16.547 --> 00:38:17.507]  You know, she's going to need one.
[00:38:17.507 --> 00:38:19.809]  She reportedly is having seizures like on the hour.
[00:38:19.809 --> 00:38:21.330]  And you soil yourself.
[00:38:22.517 --> 00:38:25.239]  I'm not knocking folks that are in that position.
[00:38:25.239 --> 00:38:38.307]  I'm just telling you, the First Lady is either wearing bulletproof underwear or she's got a diaper on, which shows she's incontinent.
[00:38:38.307 --> 00:38:49.854]  And just what a symbol for us, a mentally ill, deranged tyrant who's wearing a crap-filled diaper, who's having seizures constantly, and the media is trying to hide it.
[00:38:53.151 --> 00:38:56.194]  And then calling it right-wing BS that she's sick.
[00:38:56.194 --> 00:38:58.856]  Look at Bill Clinton!
[00:38:58.856 --> 00:39:01.078]  Look at photos of him in full light.
[00:39:01.078 --> 00:39:04.061]  He looks like a dead body.
[00:39:04.061 --> 00:39:07.644]  I've seen dead bodies.
[00:39:07.644 --> 00:39:17.773]  My... I've had dead family members that are 80 years old look better than that.
[00:39:17.773 --> 00:39:19.475]  And that's when they've been dead for three days.
[00:39:24.079 --> 00:39:26.599]  I don't know what to do at this time.
[00:39:26.599 --> 00:39:29.420]  And then they're photoshopping everywhere.
[00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:36.681]  Just like we said, we can't find Hillary supporters unless I go to the rich part of town, a very small called Terrytown in Austin, and you'll see some of her signs.
[00:39:36.681 --> 00:39:37.662]  That's it.
[00:39:37.662 --> 00:39:41.822]  There are Bernie Sanders stickers everywhere in Austin.
[00:39:41.822 --> 00:39:44.463]  There are Donald Trump stickers all over the place.
[00:39:44.463 --> 00:39:46.243]  There are more Bernie.
[00:39:46.243 --> 00:39:49.904]  You go outside Austin, there are Donald Trump stickers all over the place.
[00:39:50.831 --> 00:39:51.952]  We go all over the country.
[00:39:51.952 --> 00:39:54.994]  Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders, everywhere.
[00:39:54.994 --> 00:39:58.577]  Hillary, nowhere.
[00:39:58.577 --> 00:39:59.897]  The exit polls show it.
[00:39:59.897 --> 00:40:01.479]  She stole the nomination.
[00:40:01.479 --> 00:40:02.619]  We already know all this.
[00:40:02.619 --> 00:40:05.521]  That's what's so crazy about this.
[00:40:05.521 --> 00:40:08.263]  We already know this.
[00:40:08.263 --> 00:40:14.108]  And so all they're doing is positioning us now with a whole spectrum of polls that they've never done it like this.
[00:40:14.108 --> 00:40:15.929]  AP, Reuters, you name it.
[00:40:18.683 --> 00:40:24.731]  Where Trump, even with fixed methodology, went 10 points ahead on her.
[00:40:24.731 --> 00:40:26.753]  10 points!
[00:40:26.753 --> 00:40:29.056]  And they went, whoa!
[00:40:29.056 --> 00:40:32.701]  Changed methodology, shampled 15% more Democrats than Republicans.
[00:40:34.082 --> 00:40:38.204]  Shoot her ahead not even 12 points.
[00:40:38.204 --> 00:40:42.386]  In fact, some polls show them, even the New Reuters poll shows her only 3 points ahead.
[00:40:42.386 --> 00:40:47.549]  So they are panicking because that means Hillary must be down at like 25% or something.
[00:40:47.549 --> 00:40:54.152]  Almost every blue-collar Democrat I've talked to goes, I'm going for Trump, I'm sick of Hillary, and I'm sick of the Bushes and the establishment.
[00:40:54.152 --> 00:40:55.813]  Most of them wanted Sanders.
[00:40:55.813 --> 00:40:56.994]  Sanders was the real candidate.
[00:40:56.994 --> 00:40:58.295]  That guy could have been president.
[00:40:58.295 --> 00:41:02.577]  In fact, I'll be honest with you, as much as I disagree with Sanders' endgame and what he wants to do at the end of the road,
[00:41:03.652 --> 00:41:04.812]  I've looked at the real demographics.
[00:41:04.812 --> 00:41:09.014]  I think Bernie Sanders would have beat Donald Trump in a head-to-head real election.
[00:41:09.014 --> 00:41:11.354]  I just talk like it is, folks, and I study.
[00:41:11.354 --> 00:41:14.495]  A lot of people, insiders, agree with me.
[00:41:14.495 --> 00:41:17.256]  Bernie Sanders, America's gone socialist.
[00:41:17.256 --> 00:41:19.337]  America's got major problems.
[00:41:19.337 --> 00:41:21.277]  But at least they're trying to go after the big bankers.
[00:41:21.277 --> 00:41:26.139]  At least the socialists get that there's a super-rich that's screwing everybody.
[00:41:26.139 --> 00:41:27.859]  But they think it's class warfare.
[00:41:27.859 --> 00:41:29.199]  They think free market's the problem.
[00:41:29.199 --> 00:41:31.120]  It's a rigged market that's the problem.
[00:41:33.957 --> 00:41:35.338]  We talked to Sanders people all over the country.
[00:41:35.338 --> 00:41:38.620]  You've seen countless interviews we did with them.
[00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:41.201]  Well spoken.
[00:41:41.201 --> 00:41:42.082]  They know the issues.
[00:41:42.082 --> 00:41:44.963]  We talked to Hillary people, the ones we could finally find.
[00:41:44.963 --> 00:41:46.544]  We weren't trying to find people.
[00:41:46.544 --> 00:41:52.648]  Mark Dice isn't trying to find people that are mentally retarded.
[00:41:52.648 --> 00:41:54.028]  That's who her supporters are.
[00:41:56.567 --> 00:42:00.431]  They're really polished, slick, con artist types.
[00:42:00.431 --> 00:42:04.214]  And, you know, you're at the bar with them going, yeah, so I just hope we get all the guns.
[00:42:04.214 --> 00:42:05.095]  I hope she bans them.
[00:42:05.095 --> 00:42:06.216]  Oh, I met with her.
[00:42:06.216 --> 00:42:08.018]  She's got a, you know, con everybody.
[00:42:08.018 --> 00:42:11.061]  But as soon as we get in, we're taking them.
[00:42:11.061 --> 00:42:14.904]  Oh, cheers.
[00:42:14.904 --> 00:42:17.487]  Oh, you like my, you know, Versace purse?
[00:42:17.487 --> 00:42:18.368]  It's 20 grand.
[00:42:18.368 --> 00:42:18.888]  Oh, yeah.
[00:42:18.888 --> 00:42:19.429]  Oh, yeah.
[00:42:19.429 --> 00:42:21.791]  Let me go out and get my brand new Mercedes or BMW.
[00:42:25.339 --> 00:42:33.244]  So if you go to DrugsReport.com, it's also up on Infowars.com, you can see the photos and the Photoshop right next to it.
[00:42:33.244 --> 00:42:36.346]  And again, this is all just part of the rigging.
[00:42:36.346 --> 00:42:41.228]  It doesn't matter if Infowars is getting 100% more traffic than we just got six months ago.
[00:42:41.228 --> 00:42:46.471]  It doesn't matter if we're getting over 100% traffic from six months back, what we got the year before.
[00:42:46.471 --> 00:42:50.594]  It doesn't matter if we're exponentially growing and have seen 300% growth the last two years.
[00:42:55.793 --> 00:43:05.461]  300% growth in IP addresses coming into InfoWars.com, not to mention all our other platforms.
[00:43:05.461 --> 00:43:07.783]  300%!
[00:43:07.783 --> 00:43:09.184]  Conservatively.
[00:43:09.184 --> 00:43:11.485]  And everybody can see it.
[00:43:11.485 --> 00:43:16.409]  Just look at InfoWars everywhere.
[00:43:16.409 --> 00:43:22.634]  And then you go to AmazonsAlexa.com and it says we're down by 80%.
[00:43:24.127 --> 00:43:25.629]  Oh, and so is Drudge.
[00:43:25.629 --> 00:43:36.987]  It'd be like Cassius Clay knocking somebody out in the second round and then they say Cassius Clay lost when the guy he beat is bleeding on the ground.
[00:43:40.294 --> 00:43:44.816]  And you say, well, at least we've got all the traffic and they're going down, we're going up.
[00:43:44.816 --> 00:43:55.420]  The first thing they do is start minimizing you and cutting off your funding so that advertisers don't want to come to you before they send the government and the regulators after you to shut you down.
[00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:58.161]  And that's what they're already doing and saying they're going to do.
[00:43:58.161 --> 00:44:00.022]  So here's the deal.
[00:44:00.022 --> 00:44:04.284]  Do not take this broadcast for granted because they don't want you
[00:44:05.868 --> 00:44:15.330]  To see how we can go out and find photos online of what was really at the Hillary event, and then show you the news, and then show you how it's photoshopped.
[00:44:15.330 --> 00:44:22.312]  They don't want us to get a local NBC reporter that slipped through the cracks and actually reported that this jihadi was there.
[00:44:22.312 --> 00:44:28.694]  They don't like that InfoWars takes it one level, the White House has even written about this, Media Matters, that's who runs it.
[00:44:28.694 --> 00:44:34.535]  We take it to one level, and then drugs pushes it to another level, and then they can't contain it, and then they've got a problem.
[00:44:40.154 --> 00:44:43.535]  And see, then she'll be, she'll lose another five points from this.
[00:44:43.535 --> 00:44:45.936]  She'll be down at 25 percent.
[00:44:45.936 --> 00:44:47.837]  Now they've got to jack polls even harder.
[00:44:47.837 --> 00:44:56.940]  Now, what happens on election night when 80 percent go in for Trump and then people are there exiting and everybody's for Trump?
[00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:59.441]  Oh, you're gonna, oh, and then Trump's gonna challenge it, isn't he?
[00:45:01.872 --> 00:45:03.493]  Let me explain something to you.
[00:45:03.493 --> 00:45:13.341]  And I know most of our listeners know this, but Hillary Clinton, as the nominee, should have 10,000 people per event, even in small towns.
[00:45:13.341 --> 00:45:17.665]  Trump is having 50,000 to 75,000 in big cities, and he should.
[00:45:17.665 --> 00:45:21.128]  I used to go hear Ronald Reagan speak and it'd be like 100,000.
[00:45:21.128 --> 00:45:26.873]  At Fair Park or wherever.
[00:45:26.873 --> 00:45:28.834]  In Dallas.
[00:45:28.834 --> 00:45:29.615]  On my dad's shoulders.
[00:45:33.092 --> 00:45:40.138]  And she's got 171 people at her event.
[00:45:40.138 --> 00:45:45.202]  According to the Secret Service.
[00:45:45.202 --> 00:45:45.282]  171!
[00:45:45.282 --> 00:45:54.009]  Trump goes to little towns that have 10-15,000 people, and then everybody comes from the other towns to that sports stadium, and he'll have 15,000 people.
[00:45:54.009 --> 00:46:00.474]  His smallest crowds are 5,000, and to make them look small, they'll get them in a hangar,
[00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:04.471]  They'll get him in a stadium that holds 5,000.
[00:46:04.471 --> 00:46:06.272]  They'll only let 1,000 in.
[00:46:06.272 --> 00:46:08.574]  And then they'll pull back and say, look at his small crowd.
[00:46:08.574 --> 00:46:09.415]  And Trump's too smart.
[00:46:09.415 --> 00:46:13.718]  He goes, hey, fire marshal wouldn't let the 4,000 people outside in here.
[00:46:13.718 --> 00:46:18.601]  That's why day one he'd say, pull those cameras back.
[00:46:18.601 --> 00:46:19.441]  Show how many people are here.
[00:46:19.441 --> 00:46:20.722]  Remember that a year ago?
[00:46:20.722 --> 00:46:21.283]  They wouldn't show 50,000, 80,000, 20,000.
[00:46:26.516 --> 00:46:34.104]  See, that's why they hate Trump, because he's been in the media, he's been in business, he's been an engineer, an economist, he's seen every angle of it.
[00:46:34.104 --> 00:46:35.586]  He knows their games.
[00:46:35.586 --> 00:46:41.472]  But they'd spin and go, look at him, bitchin', sayin' the fire marshal, poor fireman, poor firefighter.
[00:46:41.472 --> 00:46:48.879]  Turns out the mayor was a Hillary supporter, did order it, and the same day, she came, and she thanked him.
[00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:52.601]  And it turned out the next town that did it.
[00:46:52.601 --> 00:46:54.642]  But guess what happened since Trump exposed it twice?
[00:46:54.642 --> 00:47:01.004]  They're not doing it anymore in Democrat cities.
[00:47:01.004 --> 00:47:05.846]  Because Trump walks right up to those fire marshals and says, I want your name.
[00:47:05.846 --> 00:47:07.126]  I want your badge number.
[00:47:07.126 --> 00:47:08.147]  I want it all.
[00:47:08.147 --> 00:47:12.328]  That building says right there on the entrance that this holds 10,000 people!
[00:47:12.328 --> 00:47:12.388]  10,000!
[00:47:12.388 --> 00:47:14.189]  You're going to let them in right now!
[00:47:20.981 --> 00:47:26.843]  Now he says it a little bit nicer than that.
[00:47:26.843 --> 00:47:30.004]  But they don't have room for Trump.
[00:47:30.004 --> 00:47:33.325]  They don't have room for Trump.
[00:47:33.325 --> 00:47:38.507]  Unless the fire marshal shows up, because they don't want those images.
[00:47:38.507 --> 00:47:39.888]  Bernie Sanders, 10,000, 20,000, Trump, 15,000, 30,000, 50,000.
[00:47:39.888 --> 00:47:40.608]  They don't like it.
[00:47:47.452 --> 00:47:53.654]  Remember, tested, trusted Ted couldn't get 3,000.
[00:47:53.654 --> 00:47:57.155]  Marco Rubio couldn't get 300.
[00:47:57.155 --> 00:48:05.637]  Straw men, fake, frauds, hoaxes, garbage, bull, manipulation!
[00:48:05.637 --> 00:48:12.119]  Hillary's biggest rallies in like Cleveland, Ohio, 2,000.
[00:48:12.119 --> 00:48:13.799]  We just showed for TV viewers all of it.
[00:48:13.799 --> 00:48:16.160]  In fact, we should put special reports out on just this issue.
[00:48:18.188 --> 00:48:20.090]  By the way, I don't know how the team just put that together so fast.
[00:48:20.090 --> 00:48:22.752]  Bravo!
[00:48:22.752 --> 00:48:33.382]  This InfoWars operation, especially the crew behind the scenes, people that actually run things, the graphics, the editing, the research, on the TV side and the radio slash TV side, it's just amazing folks.
[00:48:33.382 --> 00:48:35.364]  I just thank God for them.
[00:48:35.364 --> 00:48:36.765]  I'm very, very honored.
[00:48:36.765 --> 00:48:38.867]  And I'm very, very thankful to all of you that make this broadcast possible.
[00:48:38.867 --> 00:48:40.129]  Let me spend a few minutes talking about that.
[00:48:41.258 --> 00:48:50.166]  We are an information warfare system that is organic, that is real, that is extremely strong and getting stronger thanks to your prayers.

[00:49:51.656 --> 00:49:55.117]  AnthroPlex has some ingredients that aren't in super male and vice versa.
[00:49:55.117 --> 00:49:59.459]  AnthroPlex, the twice daily pill formulated for men that is designed to restore your masculine foundation.

[00:50:26.818 --> 00:50:30.042]  What you feel the quickest is obviously libido.
[00:50:30.042 --> 00:50:31.163]  That's what the reviewers say.
[00:50:31.163 --> 00:50:32.985]  We don't pitch this as that, but
[00:50:34.574 --> 00:50:35.675]  I've told the story before.
[00:50:35.675 --> 00:50:40.100]  I mean, when I was 40, I went to the doctor, had a big physical, all this other stuff done, and I guess this is what the doctors do.
[00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:42.663]  They said, hey, you want a prescription of Ager, a prescription of Cialis?
[00:50:42.663 --> 00:50:46.086]  And I was like, I don't really need it, but sure, I'll try it out.
[00:50:46.086 --> 00:50:48.789]  Tried it out, really, I just don't need it.
[00:50:51.311 --> 00:50:54.232]  Nothing, for me personally, nothing like SuperMetal Vitality.
[00:50:54.232 --> 00:50:55.313]  Same thing with Anthro Plus.
[00:50:55.313 --> 00:50:57.373]  I mean, big effect, but it takes a day.
[00:50:57.373 --> 00:50:58.854]  And that's just in general.
[00:50:58.854 --> 00:50:59.755]  It's amazing.
[00:50:59.755 --> 00:51:00.935]  Are you prepared to bug out?

[00:53:56.406 --> 00:53:58.027]  RealPriceSilver.com.
[00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:04.283]  We're back live.
[00:54:04.283 --> 00:54:11.269]  Joe Biggs is coming up in about 40 minutes.
[00:54:25.541 --> 00:54:28.823]  He has been to countless Hillary events, Trump events, you name it.
[00:54:28.823 --> 00:54:32.105]  And of course, I don't just believe Joe.
[00:54:32.105 --> 00:54:34.327]  Everybody knows this.
[00:54:34.327 --> 00:54:41.591]  It's a fact that you've got to get Secret Service clearance specifically to sit behind Hillary.
[00:54:41.591 --> 00:54:42.812]  And that those people are vetted.
[00:54:42.812 --> 00:54:47.775]  It's why a lot of times they're all wearing the same t-shirts or whatever because they're from a group.
[00:54:47.775 --> 00:54:53.559]  Omar Matin's daddy gets up behind
[00:54:54.770 --> 00:55:06.234]  Hillary, in the Orlando suburb, Sadiq... Matins, gets up there, and he says he's proud of it.
[00:55:06.234 --> 00:55:09.295]  He says that, you know, there's no reason he shouldn't be able to do this.
[00:55:09.295 --> 00:55:12.856]  In fact, we're going to go back to that part and play that in a minute.
[00:55:12.856 --> 00:55:17.097]  Sadiq Matin.
[00:55:17.097 --> 00:55:19.478]  And now they're saying, hey!
[00:55:19.478 --> 00:55:22.239]  That is crazy!
[00:55:22.239 --> 00:55:23.079]  That is insane!
[00:55:25.757 --> 00:55:27.103]  We didn't invite him up there.
[00:55:27.103 --> 00:55:28.388]  We didn't put him behind Hillary.
[00:55:31.377 --> 00:55:35.119]  This just shows how disconnected from reality these folks are.
[00:55:35.119 --> 00:55:40.982]  Joe Biggs is going to be giving us a detailed report later in the next hour, but you're a veteran of this, Joe.
[00:55:40.982 --> 00:55:43.123]  You've been through this many, many times.
[00:55:43.123 --> 00:55:45.544]  I know you've tried to get behind Hillary.
[00:55:45.544 --> 00:55:49.687]  I guess we'll let folks have a little secret so you can unbutton your shirt and have Hillary for President.
[00:55:49.687 --> 00:55:50.607]  That stunt never worked.
[00:55:50.607 --> 00:55:57.951]  We'll just reveal that now, but this new lie that they didn't let him in, that's certainly a fraud, isn't it?
[00:55:58.632 --> 00:56:00.073]  Yeah, it's complete and total BS.
[00:56:00.073 --> 00:56:13.127]  I mean, I've registered for her emails, her updates all the time, and I get an email saying, hey, there's going to be a Hillary event, there's going to be a Bernie event, a Trump event, so forth and so on, and it's free and open to the public a lot of times.
[00:56:13.127 --> 00:56:14.068]  And yes, you can go.
[00:56:14.628 --> 00:56:18.351]  But you have to look at the placement of where Sadiq Mateen was.
[00:56:18.351 --> 00:56:25.656]  He was standing directly behind Hillary Clinton, which means that you've got to be properly vetted to be able to be back there.
[00:56:25.656 --> 00:56:32.621]  Now that usually goes to donors, people who spend a lot of money towards her campaign and have some kind of, it's like a perk.
[00:56:33.121 --> 00:56:33.521]  We're good.
[00:56:55.277 --> 00:56:56.598]  We've got to get used to with the Clintons.
[00:56:56.598 --> 00:56:57.478]  It's going to be a lie.
[00:56:57.478 --> 00:56:58.659]  But I mean, look at this.
[00:56:58.659 --> 00:57:01.340]  Look at the kind of people she keeps in her corner.
[00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:04.842]  You have the Khans, a guy who wants to have Sharia law above all.
[00:57:04.842 --> 00:57:10.645]  And then you have Sadiq Mateen, the father of Omar Mateen, who went out and killed a whole bunch of gay people.
[00:57:10.645 --> 00:57:13.607]  And he does TV shows, basically.
[00:57:13.607 --> 00:57:14.827]  Yes, in California.
[00:57:14.827 --> 00:57:23.392]  It's a pro-Pashtun show that is watched by many Pashtun Afghanis and Europeans around America and throughout Europe.
[00:57:23.392 --> 00:57:23.952]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[00:57:25.188 --> 00:57:27.049]  Get us all that information, all that material together.
[00:57:27.049 --> 00:57:28.750]  We're showing it on screen right now.
[00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:30.931]  And come in later in the next hour.
[00:57:30.931 --> 00:57:34.713]  Let's do a whole report on this so we can get this out to everybody, Joe.
[00:57:34.713 --> 00:57:35.794]  Thanks for pointing that out.
[00:57:35.794 --> 00:57:36.734]  Roger that.
[00:57:36.734 --> 00:57:40.296]  And Joe's got the footage of him trying to, you know, get obviously into that group.
[00:57:40.296 --> 00:57:41.777]  And it's already pre-planned.
[00:57:41.777 --> 00:57:43.258]  It's part of the campaign.
[00:57:43.258 --> 00:57:44.659]  It's organized by the campaign.
[00:57:45.700 --> 00:57:48.421]  And the fact that they're in the news denying it is incredible.
[00:57:48.421 --> 00:57:52.763]  Now I'm going to get to some more of the interview he did with NBC where he doesn't think there's a problem with him being there.
[00:57:52.763 --> 00:57:55.224]  We're also going to show some video that I should get to now.
[00:57:55.224 --> 00:58:00.606]  This is a new video of Hillary having a momentary blackout and dizzy spell.
[00:58:00.606 --> 00:58:03.647]  Another video to add to all the other videos.
[00:58:03.647 --> 00:58:05.368]  Here it is.
[00:58:05.368 --> 00:58:06.148]  About health care.
[00:58:06.148 --> 00:58:12.411]  We need to make what we've got work really well and improve it and get the cost out of
[00:58:15.371 --> 00:58:20.595]  Upward spiral.
[00:58:20.595 --> 00:58:23.938]  Upward spiral.
[00:58:23.938 --> 00:58:26.160]  Now again, that's a short little clip.
[00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:29.263]  By itself you can say it's nothing, but you add it into everything else.
[00:58:29.263 --> 00:58:33.086]  She clearly is having little seizures.
[00:58:33.086 --> 00:58:38.111]  And again, I have an uncle that's got epilepsy from a motorcycle accident.
[00:58:38.111 --> 00:58:38.711]  Same thing with him.
[00:58:39.482 --> 00:58:41.483]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, in 70 seconds.
[00:58:41.483 --> 00:58:46.186]  We've got a lot of other economic news and, oh, big news on arresting climate deniers.
[00:58:50.214 --> 00:58:50.874]  Uh, yeah.
[00:58:50.874 --> 00:58:56.697]  First of all, I want to say Secret 12, X2, Supermail, Brain Force, Prostagart, Silver Bullet.
[00:58:56.697 --> 00:58:57.658]  I use them all.
[00:58:57.658 --> 00:58:58.638]  They're phenomenal.
[00:58:58.638 --> 00:58:59.379]  They work.
[00:58:59.379 --> 00:59:00.219]  Buy them, folks.
[00:59:00.219 --> 00:59:00.639]  Thank you, brother.
[00:59:00.639 --> 00:59:02.620]  I really thank you guys for putting those out there.
[00:59:02.620 --> 00:59:08.843]  I am a relatively short-time listener and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[00:59:08.843 --> 00:59:10.824]  Welcome to the InfoWar.
[00:59:10.824 --> 00:59:16.247]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the InfoWar at the same time.
[00:59:16.567 --> 00:59:17.408]  I'm a nine-year listener.
[00:59:17.408 --> 00:59:21.332]  I buy all the Nutraceuticals, AcuFX, Nascent Iodine.
[00:59:21.332 --> 00:59:22.093]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:59:22.093 --> 00:59:23.134]  Have they worked for you?
[00:59:23.134 --> 00:59:25.997]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[00:59:25.997 --> 00:59:27.098]  What products are you taking?
[00:59:27.098 --> 00:59:35.367]  Everything from Super Male to Brain Force to Winter Sun, X2, even got a little DNA Force.
[00:59:35.367 --> 00:59:38.871]  So I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofilth.
[00:59:38.971 --> 00:59:44.017]  Visit Infowarslives.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourself.
[00:59:44.017 --> 00:59:45.599]  That's Infowarslives.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:59:45.599 --> 00:59:46.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:02.216 --> 01:00:05.562]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:00:05.562 --> 01:00:08.828]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:24.557 --> 01:00:27.578]  Now, if you just joined us, I want to be very, very clear.
[01:00:27.578 --> 01:00:37.202]  I don't think the number one story in the world is Omar Mateen, the mass murderer from the gay Orlando nightclub that killed 50-plus people.
[01:00:37.202 --> 01:00:49.307]  I don't think that it's the number one story in the world that his dad showed up in a suburb of Orlando yesterday and was part of a vetted group behind Hillary Clinton, and then he went on the news and said he was, you know, basically proud of Hillary Clinton and how wonderful she is.
[01:00:51.112 --> 01:01:18.425]  And by that, I don't mean that story by itself is the most important, but what it's illustrative of, what it shows you is the total disconnect and the absolute ignorance and the fact that there is such a love, such a fellow traveler attitude with the Islamists and the Democratic Party, even though the two groups supposedly don't agree with each other on almost anything,
[01:01:19.508 --> 01:01:29.095]  That they would have this guy be vetted by the Secret Service and put behind her and that he wouldn't even think that there was an issue with the fact that, hey, your son killed all these people.
[01:01:29.095 --> 01:01:32.017]  Is it a good thing that you're here?
[01:01:32.017 --> 01:01:44.686]  So I want to play that clip for folks because, again, it just shows how the establishment and even their minions are smoking their own propaganda.
[01:01:44.686 --> 01:01:46.967]  They're smoking their own bull.
[01:01:46.967 --> 01:01:48.168]  They're buying their own baloney.
[01:01:52.708 --> 01:01:58.332]  And that's scary because this is an establishment that's making a lot of really dangerous moves worldwide.
[01:01:58.332 --> 01:02:04.096]  And even mainline analysts, retired generals, foreign leaders are saying, what are you doing?
[01:02:04.096 --> 01:02:06.778]  No one ever acted like this before from the West.
[01:02:06.778 --> 01:02:15.003]  And we have a bunch of people that have overthrown our institutions who still act like they're revolutionaries when they're in charge.
[01:02:15.003 --> 01:02:15.904]  And that's very dangerous.
[01:02:15.904 --> 01:02:18.926]  And the late actor Ron Silver,
[01:02:20.148 --> 01:02:26.670]  Who's a big leftist and better known as being a producer than he was being in films like Die Hard.
[01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:31.151]  He was at the Clinton's inauguration in 1993 and F-16s flew over.
[01:02:31.151 --> 01:02:41.274]  And this guy was so disconnected from reality, such an America hater, that he famously in front of newspaper reporters and Democrats went, how dare them fly those over and threaten us!
[01:02:41.274 --> 01:02:46.675]  And they went, Ron, it's okay, there are jets now.
[01:02:46.675 --> 01:02:49.296]  And see, that tells you everything you have to know about those people.
[01:02:50.003 --> 01:03:00.451]  They are just, people with guns, American flags, there's just a bunch of neurotic fruits!
[01:03:00.451 --> 01:03:03.033]  And they just haven't lived in the real world.
[01:03:03.033 --> 01:03:11.198]  Here is the daddy of the nightclub killer, the mass murderer, Omar Mateen's papa, at the Hillary event.
[01:03:11.198 --> 01:03:12.740]  Here he is.
[01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:17.243]  Clinton's campaign know that you were going to that event and sitting right directly behind her?
[01:03:18.741 --> 01:03:23.142]  It's a democratic party so everybody can join.
[01:03:23.142 --> 01:03:30.524]  Do you think that some people will be surprised to know and to see that you were there in Orlando or near Orlando?
[01:03:30.524 --> 01:03:33.444]  Why they should be surprised?
[01:03:33.444 --> 01:03:38.985]  I love United States and I've been living here for a long time.
[01:03:38.985 --> 01:03:40.746]  Why you be surprised?
[01:03:40.746 --> 01:03:46.047]  I only do TV show for Taliban and Pashtun.
[01:03:48.121 --> 01:03:56.869]  Family help bring in refugee, me friendy, me hook into CIA.
[01:03:56.869 --> 01:04:04.556]  This guy was brought here and it's just all designed in social engineering to bring in incompatible people.
[01:04:04.556 --> 01:04:08.699]  I mean can we put up the photos again of the
[01:04:10.123 --> 01:04:12.864]  Islamic women in the Teletubby outfits.
[01:04:12.864 --> 01:04:13.704]  I mean, that's what they are.
[01:04:13.704 --> 01:04:25.688]  If you don't know what Teletubby are, they're like these little space alien things, these little hats that look like they have a little condom in on the back of their head, a little antenna.
[01:04:25.688 --> 01:04:29.989]  And I mean, that's what these women are wearing, these Teletubby outfits.
[01:04:29.989 --> 01:04:32.450]  And then here they are playing these other women.
[01:04:32.450 --> 01:04:34.010]  And it's just like, look at the future.
[01:04:34.010 --> 01:04:34.951]  Look at science.
[01:04:34.951 --> 01:04:38.592]  Look at look at all the high tech gear in those bikinis.
[01:04:39.878 --> 01:04:47.766]  And then just all the, you know, coding and science and everything else that goes into God's amazing designs.
[01:04:47.766 --> 01:04:51.270]  I'm such a fan of God's artwork, I have to tell you.
[01:04:51.270 --> 01:04:55.654]  And then meanwhile, you've got this demonic cult covering it up.
[01:04:55.654 --> 01:04:56.675]  And I just, I don't like it.
[01:04:58.028 --> 01:04:58.989]  Look, it's okay.
[01:04:58.989 --> 01:05:00.070]  I'll explain it.
[01:05:00.070 --> 01:05:02.192]  Joe Bates here with Infowars.com.
[01:05:02.192 --> 01:05:05.514]  CNN bashes conspiratorial questions about Hillary's health.
[01:05:05.514 --> 01:05:13.340]  CNN is attempting to dismiss questions about Hillary Clinton's health by asserting that photos which appear to show her struggling to climb some steps are old.
[01:05:13.340 --> 01:05:23.128]  However, the news network conveniently fails to mention the fact that both federal and NYPD sources have blown the whistle on Hillary's difficulties with balance and walking in the past.
[01:05:23.368 --> 01:05:33.818]  Under the headline Drudge Report Misleads Readers With Hillary Clinton Photo, CNN's Brian Settler writes that news aggregator Matt Drudge is taking a six-month-old photo out of context.
[01:05:33.818 --> 01:05:40.124]  Settler claims that the images merely show Hillary being aided after a slip and dismisses concerns about Hillary's health.
[01:05:40.124 --> 01:05:42.927]  In addition, the claims of John Cardeo are not mentioned.
[01:05:42.927 --> 01:05:44.689]  This has been Joe Biggs with Infowars.com
[01:05:59.764 --> 01:06:00.265]  Not a group.
[01:06:00.265 --> 01:06:01.726]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[01:06:01.726 --> 01:06:03.047]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:06:03.047 --> 01:06:04.248]  Why is this so good?
[01:06:04.248 --> 01:06:09.533]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:06:09.533 --> 01:06:23.084]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:06:23.084 --> 01:06:24.445]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:06:25.226 --> 01:06:26.868]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[01:06:26.868 --> 01:06:29.430]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:06:29.430 --> 01:06:30.731]  These are all parasites.
[01:06:30.731 --> 01:06:31.852]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:06:31.852 --> 01:06:33.193]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:06:33.193 --> 01:06:37.696]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:06:37.696 --> 01:06:40.859]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:06:40.959 --> 01:06:44.003]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:06:44.003 --> 01:06:45.064]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:06:45.064 --> 01:06:47.006]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[01:06:47.006 --> 01:06:48.027]  And folks, you can't lose.
[01:06:48.027 --> 01:06:50.730]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:06:50.730 --> 01:06:53.994]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[01:06:53.994 --> 01:06:56.257]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[01:06:56.257 --> 01:06:58.199]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:06:59.853 --> 01:07:08.036]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but were waiting for an outrageously low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[01:07:08.036 --> 01:07:08.837]  Here's why.
[01:07:08.837 --> 01:07:12.978]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse.
[01:07:12.978 --> 01:07:13.899]  So please listen.
[01:07:13.899 --> 01:07:17.620]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:22.062]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases.
[01:07:22.162 --> 01:07:22.302]  I think?
[01:07:41.221 --> 01:07:45.207]  Of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low price for InfoWars listeners.
[01:07:45.207 --> 01:07:46.949]  So it's a good time to check it out.
[01:07:46.949 --> 01:07:48.651]  Go to gridwars.com.
[01:07:48.651 --> 01:07:50.374]  That's gridwars.com.
[01:07:50.374 --> 01:07:54.259]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[01:07:54.259 --> 01:07:55.821]  Go to gridwars.com.
[01:07:55.821 --> 01:07:57.163]  That's gridwars.com.
[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:17.022]  We are on the march.
[01:08:17.022 --> 01:08:20.186]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:08:20.186 --> 01:08:28.675]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:28.675 --> 01:08:31.659]  Fox News has had its medical team come out.
[01:08:31.659 --> 01:08:33.561]  We're going to play a clip of that here in just a few minutes.
[01:08:33.561 --> 01:08:36.204]  And said, look, she needs to release her neurology records.
[01:08:37.632 --> 01:08:39.793]  And I was thinking, who better to bring on?
[01:08:39.793 --> 01:08:53.017]  Somebody that's known Hillary Clinton, somebody who's been on the Council on Foreign Relations, somebody who was the head of psychological warfare for the State Department, co-author of many of Tom Clancy's books as well, Dr. Steve Pachinick of StevePachinick.com.
[01:08:53.017 --> 01:08:59.680]  He's an MD and PhD, an American psychiatrist, former State Department official, author, and publisher.
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:06.262]  So he has an MIT degree as well, trained in psychiatry at Harvard and international relations at MIT.
[01:09:07.554 --> 01:09:10.215]  To specifically talk about Hillary.
[01:09:10.215 --> 01:09:19.677]  Look, it always comes up in elections to say somebody's got a health problem, or somebody doesn't have a health problem, and a lot of times it's a red herring.
[01:09:19.677 --> 01:09:24.278]  But with Hillary, every day now, she doesn't know where she's at.
[01:09:24.278 --> 01:09:26.638]  She suddenly starts having clearly seizures.
[01:09:26.638 --> 01:09:33.280]  Again, I have an uncle who was in a motorcycle accident, and he'll be sitting there with him, he'll suddenly start doing the exact same thing she does.
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:36.581]  When she was out under the bright lights at the DNC, she started doing it repeatedly.
[01:09:37.621 --> 01:09:39.523]  She's falling and stumbling downstairs.
[01:09:39.523 --> 01:09:40.824]  She looks bad.
[01:09:40.824 --> 01:09:42.945]  She has lesions on her tongue.
[01:09:42.945 --> 01:09:46.088]  Dr. Steve Pachinik isn't just a top psychiatrist.
[01:09:46.088 --> 01:09:51.912]  He was a board examiner and ran entire medical facilities.
[01:09:51.912 --> 01:09:54.234]  And so he was also bringing up the fact that Charles Krauthammer,
[01:09:55.054 --> 01:09:58.236]  Had, at one time, actually worked under him in one of these programs.
[01:09:58.236 --> 01:10:05.199]  So to break all of this down, and Krauthammer's saying there's serious questions as well, is Dr. Steve Pucinich.
[01:10:05.199 --> 01:10:20.787]  Doctor, specifically, go over your background for folks that may not know who you are, your curriculum background, your letters, and then let's get specifically into what you're seeing with Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[01:10:21.966 --> 01:10:29.571]  Number one, my background is I went to Cornell Medical School, received my MD in 1968.
[01:10:29.571 --> 01:10:35.534]  Then I went to Harvard in 1971, became a psychiatrist.
[01:10:35.534 --> 01:10:40.337]  At the same time, I went to MIT to receive my PhD in International Relations.
[01:10:40.337 --> 01:10:47.722]  I became board certified and eventually I was brought in as a board examiner in neurology and psychiatry.
[01:10:47.722 --> 01:10:49.283]  But in my private practice,
[01:10:50.006 --> 01:11:04.137]  In Washington, D.C., despite also working at the State Department as a DAS under Nixon, Ford, Reagan, Bush, and others, I also treated congressmen, senators, and major politicians.
[01:11:04.137 --> 01:11:06.278]  I clearly won't say who.
[01:11:06.278 --> 01:11:19.468]  The key issue for me, and why I'm grateful you brought me on the show again, and as you know, you didn't know what I was about to say, and I didn't want anybody to know, but the point of fact is the two physicians
[01:11:20.168 --> 01:11:33.994]  Dr. Siegel and the other gentleman from Mount Sinai who are on Fox News were absolutely correct, as was Charlie Krauthammer, for demanding that we have an independent investigation of Hillary Clinton.
[01:11:33.994 --> 01:11:35.615]  Why do I say that?
[01:11:35.615 --> 01:11:42.258]  Number one, for some time now, she has had a history of seizures.
[01:11:42.258 --> 01:11:45.059]  One sees that she has a hard time going up the steps.
[01:11:45.723 --> 01:11:47.664]  She's totally confused.
[01:11:47.664 --> 01:12:02.111]  And in one of the most revealing interviews that was done on Fox News, where Chris Wallace repeatedly asked her, did you or did you not commit a malfeasance or a felony?
[01:12:02.111 --> 01:12:08.074]  With the emails she just repeated, total lies in my business.
[01:12:08.359 --> 01:12:19.762]  Given the fact that she's had a history of three major concussions, 1998, 2009, 2012, she's been put on anticoagulant.
[01:12:19.762 --> 01:12:25.864]  And I will go over her medical record as it was written by her internist, Lisa Bardach.
[01:12:25.864 --> 01:12:35.227]  She evidences a serious problem of neurological and cognitive deficit in the brain, be it post-stroke syndrome,
[01:12:35.663 --> 01:12:43.625]  Syndrome, or if I said, if you have constant thrombosis in the brain, you have to look for occult tumors.
[01:12:43.625 --> 01:12:59.189]  Occult tumors meaning secret tumors that are in the brain which were biopsied when she was at the Physicians and Surgeons Columbia in 2012 and remained there for six months.
[01:12:59.189 --> 01:13:04.891]  There's no question in my mind that Columbia Physicians and Surgeons has a mandate
[01:13:05.438 --> 01:13:14.041]  To reveal the CAT scans, the MRI, and every test that they had done regarding Hillary Clinton's physical status.
[01:13:14.041 --> 01:13:14.741]  Absolutely!
[01:13:14.741 --> 01:13:20.923]  So just release it all, and you don't have any excuses to do it, or you're hiding something clearly.
[01:13:20.923 --> 01:13:21.443]  Correct.
[01:13:21.443 --> 01:13:32.767]  Now, let me go over this, Alex, and I appreciate it, and I want the audience to understand, as most of the audience realizes, I don't usually come on the show unless I have something that I'd like to
[01:13:33.627 --> 01:13:37.850]  Tell the American audience, which is very, very important.
[01:13:37.850 --> 01:13:51.780]  One of the other issues in my world as a psychological operations and intelligence officer and as a DAS, I used to give lectures on presidential health at Fort McNair and West Point.
[01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:58.005]  And what I used to go over was how we in the Republic hide the health of our president.
[01:13:58.005 --> 01:14:00.847]  And I start with Woodrow Wilson, who had a stroke.
[01:14:01.403 --> 01:14:10.287]  And for a year and a half, he was in a semi-comatose, comatose state, where Colonel Howes and his wife was running the White House.
[01:14:10.287 --> 01:14:12.048]  We can't have that.
[01:14:12.048 --> 01:14:26.815]  Secondly, we had FDR, who was a cripple, and the Secret Service made certain that no one, but no one, took pictures of Franklin Roosevelt as a cripple in the administrations he was in.
[01:14:26.815 --> 01:14:28.876]  Then we had a far more serious problem.
[01:14:29.403 --> 01:14:46.133]  When I was at Cornell Medical School between 64 and 68, a pathology class was given to us that really revealed the story of an individual who went into surgery at Cornell, an orthopedic surgery, and became psychotic.
[01:14:46.133 --> 01:14:47.374]  Who was that individual?
[01:14:47.374 --> 01:14:48.555]  It was John F. Kennedy.
[01:14:49.244 --> 01:15:09.226]  Subsequently, we found out that John F. Kennedy came into the White House illegally and in the Navy illegally because he had a Addison's disease, ADDISONS, which meant that he had a deficiency and absence of the adrenal gland and had to be given daily shots
[01:15:10.007 --> 01:15:10.707]  We're good to go.
[01:15:39.352 --> 01:15:42.674]  He had stress and had developed thrombophlebitis.
[01:15:42.674 --> 01:15:47.096]  He became paranoid as a result of Watergate and he had to leave.
[01:15:47.096 --> 01:15:54.279]  We then had a president whom I worked under, I did not work directly for, who had Alzheimer's.
[01:15:54.279 --> 01:16:01.662]  Whether he had Alzheimer's towards the end of his administration or from the beginning is a very serious question.
[01:16:01.662 --> 01:16:05.244]  There's no question in my mind that during the Reagan administration,
[01:16:05.814 --> 01:16:12.800]  I had been working for James Baker, as well as Bush Sr., who was then the Vice President.
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:17.163]  Now we have a case where you have complete sociopathy.
[01:16:17.163 --> 01:16:19.725]  You have lies upon lies.
[01:16:19.725 --> 01:16:24.649]  There's no question her personality is one of the complete sociopaths.
[01:16:24.649 --> 01:16:33.636]  Whatever they're saying about Trump right now, that he's sociopathic, he's not capable, he's impulsive, that's all nonsense coming from 50.
[01:16:34.878 --> 01:16:39.684]  Totally incompetent Republicans whom I know personally and have worked with.
[01:16:39.684 --> 01:16:45.512]  Michael Hayden, who's director of the CIA and was the director of the National Security Agency.
[01:16:46.010 --> 01:16:48.311]  Was nothing more than a political general.
[01:16:48.311 --> 01:16:53.835]  In the military intelligence field, as one of my generals once said, he's a moron.
[01:16:53.835 --> 01:16:56.597]  And he was not considered the brightest of all.
[01:16:56.597 --> 01:17:03.641]  The only man I would respect among all of them was John Negroponte, who was a serious ambassador.
[01:17:05.442 --> 01:17:08.363]  Again, you have treated world leaders, treated U.S.
[01:17:08.363 --> 01:17:10.003]  leaders, it's all on record.
[01:17:10.003 --> 01:17:11.583]  So you are an expert of experts.
[01:17:11.583 --> 01:17:15.624]  You are sitting here, you know, certified to look at this neurology as an M.D.
[01:17:15.624 --> 01:17:20.505]  and as a psychiatrist, on record, and the former head of psychological warfare of the State Department.
[01:17:20.505 --> 01:17:24.905]  So you're perfectly, you know, probably the best person in the world to talk to on this.
[01:17:24.905 --> 01:17:28.586]  I'm not a rocket scientist, but I can ask somebody, hey, do you have Parkinson's disease?
[01:17:28.586 --> 01:17:29.186]  Yes, I do.
[01:17:29.186 --> 01:17:34.767]  I mean, I can see when someone looks like they have a neurological disorder, Parkinson's type, you know, spectrum or whatever.
[01:17:35.367 --> 01:17:37.669]  Now, I'm not a doctor.
[01:17:37.669 --> 01:17:40.670]  I have no training in it, but I've seen it enough to know what it is.
[01:17:40.670 --> 01:17:56.741]  You as a truly educated expert, six months, a few years ago, disappearing into this brain tumor specialist facility, all the bizarre behavior, her obviously degenerating, acting so angry, looking disoriented, having many seizures.
[01:17:56.741 --> 01:18:03.725]  Looking at her, just in the videos you see online, if you saw that of a lay person, what would you say is wrong with them?
[01:18:04.756 --> 01:18:27.216]  I would say that she has a brain tumor, either glioblastoma or that she has possibly an onset of Alzheimer's disease which begins as what we would call a subcortical vascular dementia because of thrombosis to the brain.
[01:18:27.216 --> 01:18:30.279]  Either way, it has to be ruled out.
[01:18:30.279 --> 01:18:31.700]  If she has early onset
[01:18:32.649 --> 01:18:41.974]  Uh, dementia, which she may well have, which came out in the issue with Chris Wallace and her quick discussion as a short circuit.
[01:18:41.974 --> 01:18:46.656]  And then Keane, Keane, her vice president, took over.
[01:18:46.656 --> 01:19:02.144]  It clearly said to me that Hillary at this point is not qualified physically, mentally, or emotionally to be the president of the United States unless she is given a clean record of health, which I doubt will happen.
[01:19:02.697 --> 01:19:04.818]  Now let me give you exactly what happened.
[01:19:04.818 --> 01:19:12.461]  They produced a most cockamamie or a very run-down or watered-down medical history.
[01:19:12.461 --> 01:19:13.701]  This is public.
[01:19:13.701 --> 01:19:17.403]  Her primary care physician is Dr. Lisa Bardak.
[01:19:17.403 --> 01:19:18.423]  I don't know who she is.
[01:19:18.423 --> 01:19:22.625]  She's an internist consistent with her position.
[01:19:22.625 --> 01:19:27.187]  She's the chairman of the Department of Medicine at Mount Kisco, New York.
[01:19:27.187 --> 01:19:29.948]  Now you're talking about a very small town.
[01:19:30.689 --> 01:19:37.813]  In comparison to where Hillary was really treated, which was physicians and surgeons at Columbia.
[01:19:37.813 --> 01:19:42.235]  And Columbia knows very well, the neurologists there know very well.
[01:19:42.731 --> 01:19:47.154]  That she was worked up with an MRI, CAT scans, and everything else.
[01:19:47.154 --> 01:19:56.199]  Sure, so what they're doing is she's going to some local treating physician, doing a limited thing, not sharing the other medical records from years ago, and then putting that out as her supposed medical history.
[01:19:56.199 --> 01:19:56.860]  Correct.
[01:19:56.860 --> 01:19:59.201]  Then she has anticoagulant treatment.
[01:19:59.201 --> 01:20:01.243]  Now, is she still on anticoagulant?
[01:20:01.243 --> 01:20:02.143]  We have to know that.
[01:20:02.143 --> 01:20:03.984]  That means she's bleeding out.
[01:20:03.984 --> 01:20:07.607]  She had three episodes of concussions that she even documented.
[01:20:07.607 --> 01:20:08.207]  Ninety-eight.
[01:20:09.444 --> 01:20:14.093]  2009 and 2012 where she had to be treated for 12 months.
[01:20:14.093 --> 01:20:18.100]  She wore glasses that are called Fresno Prism glasses.
[01:20:18.755 --> 01:20:25.737]  Which are usually worn by patients who have diplopia, or double vision, and they have to be able to see better.
[01:20:25.737 --> 01:20:29.899]  And that was shown in the Benghazi inquiry.
[01:20:29.899 --> 01:20:30.239]  Yes, sir.
[01:20:30.239 --> 01:20:41.903]  What are you seeing when you see her, what looks like as a layperson, a seizure where she seems to not have balance, and then she's been taught to smile and act like it's fun, but people say, are you okay?
[01:20:41.903 --> 01:20:44.064]  Well, what you see there is the classical
[01:20:45.362 --> 01:20:58.209]  Petit Mal which can go into a grand mal seizure and then what I saw was the gentleman who came by her, the secret service, and gave her diazepam, which is Valium, in order to reduce the seizure activity.
[01:20:58.209 --> 01:21:04.693]  And that's the key, they're running up injecting her with what, I guess a depressant to stop the brain activity?
[01:21:04.693 --> 01:21:07.474]  Yes, an anti-convulsant medication.
[01:21:07.474 --> 01:21:10.836]  She would be on Dilatin and other parts, but here's the issue.
[01:21:11.601 --> 01:21:15.103]  The issue I'm getting to is far greater than even Hillary Clinton.
[01:21:15.103 --> 01:21:22.889]  It's the problem that we have with the Secret Service, with the FBI and the CIA, and I come back to it again and again and again.
[01:21:22.889 --> 01:21:35.378]  I don't wish her illness, but I do condemn the Secret Service for the fact that their only loyalty is to their job and to the President of the United States.
[01:21:35.378 --> 01:21:37.799]  It is not to the Republic.
[01:21:37.799 --> 01:21:40.361]  They have covered up more malfeasance.
[01:21:40.999 --> 01:21:44.682]  More irregularity and more miscreant behavior.
[01:22:11.780 --> 01:22:15.723]  Or looks out of it and is reportedly so mean and so rude to people now.
[01:22:15.723 --> 01:22:19.886]  I mean, to me, that just is what I've heard about Alzheimer's or dementia.
[01:22:19.886 --> 01:22:22.588]  And it shows she's degenerating very, very quickly.
[01:22:22.588 --> 01:22:25.631]  I'm just concerned about putting somebody like her in power.
[01:22:25.631 --> 01:22:28.113]  I mean, for the obvious reasons.
[01:22:28.113 --> 01:22:30.474]  So what do you think she's specifically done?
[01:22:30.474 --> 01:22:32.956]  Obviously, call for the release of her full medical records.
[01:22:32.956 --> 01:22:33.257]  What else?
[01:22:33.857 --> 01:22:37.339]  Well, there's call for release of a full medical record.
[01:22:37.339 --> 01:22:46.625]  At the same time, I would want Congress to call in the Secret Service to demand exactly what they have witnessed, what they have seen under oath.
[01:22:46.625 --> 01:22:48.006]  What are you injecting her with?
[01:22:48.006 --> 01:22:49.227]  There should be congressional hearings.
[01:22:49.227 --> 01:22:52.269]  Why does a person follow her with a tranquilizer dart?
[01:22:52.269 --> 01:22:54.710]  They won't do that because it'll look partisan.
[01:22:54.710 --> 01:23:02.315]  But at the same time, I would put a gag order on everyone who's involved in any way in adding ad hominem.
[01:23:03.596 --> 01:23:13.379]  I mean, the fact that 50 Republican experts, all of whom were neocons, Zelikow, you have Zelikow.
[01:23:13.379 --> 01:23:13.759]  No, I get it.
[01:23:13.759 --> 01:23:14.980]  You don't want political points.
[01:23:14.980 --> 01:23:15.940]  You care about the Republicans.
[01:23:15.940 --> 01:23:18.141]  I don't care about the political points.
[01:23:18.141 --> 01:23:25.143]  I care about the mental health and the medical health of this woman, and it has to be addressed ASAP.
[01:23:25.143 --> 01:23:27.244]  Is she unfit to be the nominee?
[01:23:27.244 --> 01:23:28.184]  At this point, yes.
[01:23:29.460 --> 01:23:31.121]  Unless proven otherwise.
[01:23:31.121 --> 01:23:36.745]  She is not qualified to be the President of the United States as of today.
[01:23:36.745 --> 01:23:42.890]  She neither has the mental capacity, the physical capacity as we've seen them bring her up.
[01:23:42.890 --> 01:23:44.151]  I interrupt you, Dr. Pachinic.
[01:23:44.151 --> 01:23:46.413]  Start over with that statement because we're going to put this out.
[01:23:46.413 --> 01:23:47.954]  Start over.
[01:23:47.954 --> 01:23:57.741]  I demand that she have an independent medical neurological evaluation by people who are neither Republicans nor Democrats.
[01:23:58.243 --> 01:24:04.766]  To evaluate her mental status and physical status to be the President of the United States.
[01:24:04.766 --> 01:24:13.490]  I demand that Columbia PNS release the records on the neurological workup of a President of the United States.
[01:24:13.490 --> 01:24:15.210]  Potential President.
[01:24:15.210 --> 01:24:21.093]  Columbia has a far greater obligation to the country than it does to its patients.
[01:24:21.093 --> 01:24:25.875]  The HIPAA law, which ironically was brought in by Bill Clinton, has to be broken.
[01:24:26.403 --> 01:24:31.745]  Because it's a far greater issue than the concern of one individual.
[01:24:31.745 --> 01:24:34.746]  We are now talking about the nation-state.
[01:24:34.746 --> 01:24:45.789]  What we've seen is a lot of distraction of a group of her people, including Republicans who may or may not have been co-opted, to say that Trump is impulsive, he's erratic.
[01:24:45.789 --> 01:24:51.411]  In fact, the reality is that's a lot of distortion and distraction which belongs to her.
[01:24:52.691 --> 01:25:04.376]  Well, I've actually found Trump is super disciplined and is just like a workhorse and very, very calm and focused in private, and that's what folks that know him say.
[01:25:04.376 --> 01:25:05.017]  Correct.
[01:25:05.017 --> 01:25:05.817]  I'm not here.
[01:25:05.817 --> 01:25:08.398]  I don't want to get into the politics, but let's make it very clear.
[01:25:08.891 --> 01:25:16.597]  There is no history that I know about Trump where he has actually killed individuals intentionally or unintentionally.
[01:25:16.597 --> 01:25:21.141]  Yeah, Trump hasn't gone around and destabilized all these countries and said, I came, I saw, he died.
[01:25:21.141 --> 01:25:21.742]  Correct.
[01:25:21.742 --> 01:25:26.886]  Now, we could honestly say her judgment about Libya is in question.
[01:25:26.886 --> 01:25:31.330]  Was it her judgment because she thought that was the best thing to do?
[01:25:31.330 --> 01:25:37.815]  Or did she have an underlying psychological, neurological problem which compelled her to act and
[01:25:38.314 --> 01:25:42.756]  Be aggressive and go to war as she did in Iraq and elsewhere.
[01:25:42.756 --> 01:25:45.637]  Well, that was my next question because you are a top psychiatrist.
[01:25:45.637 --> 01:25:47.157]  Let me expand on that.
[01:25:47.157 --> 01:25:48.678]  A lot of times you read about dementia.
[01:25:48.678 --> 01:25:51.199]  You read about brain tumors.
[01:25:51.199 --> 01:25:52.879]  People tend to start acting like kids.
[01:25:52.879 --> 01:25:54.700]  They tend to have rages.
[01:25:54.700 --> 01:25:57.221]  They tend to get aggressive in a lot of videos.
[01:25:57.221 --> 01:26:04.684]  I thought it was just her acting like a kid for her audience, but more and more I see her on C-SPAN and things off to the side acting like a little kid.
[01:26:05.544 --> 01:26:08.786]  But also kind of raging and stomping around.
[01:26:08.786 --> 01:26:10.227]  What is that indicative of, Doctor?
[01:26:10.227 --> 01:26:14.089]  It's indicative of onset of possibly dementia.
[01:26:14.089 --> 01:26:20.313]  Dementia in her case would not be unusual because she's 69 years old going on 70.
[01:26:20.313 --> 01:26:23.955]  With all due respect to her, she's been under a lot of stress.
[01:26:23.955 --> 01:26:26.176]  She's flown all over the world.
[01:26:26.176 --> 01:26:29.658]  She has been dehydrated, but she has a well-known history.
[01:26:31.719 --> 01:26:33.220]  Of having concussions.
[01:26:33.220 --> 01:26:43.823]  Not just one concussion, but concussions in 1998, 2009, and a major concussion in 2012 where she had to wear the Fresno Prisms.
[01:26:43.823 --> 01:26:53.267]  Which means that she has an ongoing post-concussion syndrome and or a glioblastoma or an onset of dementia or all three.
[01:26:53.993 --> 01:27:02.101]  But without an independent evaluation, without the release of the records from Columbia, not from this Dr. Louis Bardek.
[01:27:02.101 --> 01:27:04.083]  I don't know who she is.
[01:27:04.083 --> 01:27:05.384]  Release the real medical records?
[01:27:05.384 --> 01:27:08.487]  Why was she disappeared for a year, six months in treatment?
[01:27:08.487 --> 01:27:09.788]  That's not blood clots.
[01:27:09.788 --> 01:27:10.469]  No.
[01:27:10.469 --> 01:27:12.911]  That is far more serious than a blood clot.
[01:27:12.911 --> 01:27:17.636]  And also, usually when I examine the resident, I often ask,
[01:27:18.211 --> 01:27:22.413]  What does it mean when you have a history of multiple blood clots?
[01:27:22.413 --> 01:27:25.855]  Now usually, most residents don't know that.
[01:27:25.855 --> 01:27:28.697]  The answer is that we have a hidden tumor.
[01:27:28.697 --> 01:27:33.380]  And in this case, it could well be glioblastoma, which is a very serious
[01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:36.401]  And by hidden, sir, can you give us the technicals?
[01:27:36.401 --> 01:27:37.941]  You mean it's a deep tumor?
[01:27:37.941 --> 01:27:46.943]  Deep tumor, which is quite aggressive or can be controlled with chemotherapy, radiation, or some other... Well, we have to speculate.
[01:27:46.943 --> 01:27:48.464]  I mean, she looks pretty bad.
[01:27:48.464 --> 01:27:50.324]  She disappears for large periods of time.
[01:27:50.324 --> 01:27:52.745]  She has to be in the bathroom longer during a debate.
[01:27:52.745 --> 01:27:53.725]  Correct.
[01:27:53.725 --> 01:28:01.527]  If this were to occur in Trump right now, if Trump were to evidence the kind of behavior that she evidenced, with all due respect,
[01:28:01.997 --> 01:28:09.442]  We would immediately have asked for Trump's background in terms of medical history, psychiatric history and all.
[01:28:09.442 --> 01:28:25.773]  It's also interesting that throughout her whole life, even as a senator, she keeps on fabulating a story where she created all kinds of economic opportunity, yet today I wrote a whole blog saying that she didn't create any jobs in New York State.
[01:28:25.773 --> 01:28:28.535]  In fact, that 25% of the jobs went under.
[01:28:29.093 --> 01:28:30.674]  Let's expand on this.
[01:28:30.674 --> 01:28:36.476]  What does the psychology say of her and Bill that they would steal the George Washington plates and cutlery?
[01:28:54.761 --> 01:28:58.762]  Well, in that sense, you have what I've always said.
[01:28:58.762 --> 01:29:06.805]  You have basically a very low-class, sociopathic family of filial duty, which really is an arrangement of two people.
[01:29:06.805 --> 01:29:09.706]  You're talking about white trash?
[01:29:09.706 --> 01:29:10.506]  In effect, yeah.
[01:29:10.506 --> 01:29:14.367]  That's not a diagnosis, but Bill has never been honest.
[01:29:14.367 --> 01:29:16.928]  Bill has never accomplished really anything.
[01:29:17.375 --> 01:29:21.038]  Bill is born of a mother who was in the prostitute business.
[01:29:21.038 --> 01:29:27.484]  He came out of Hope, Arkansas, which was the headquarters of the mob for the Jews and the Italians.
[01:29:27.484 --> 01:29:29.866]  And I mean, that history is well known.
[01:29:30.498 --> 01:29:44.026]  But to come forth and then bring us, again, another problem of sociopathy, we have to start to ask the question, what's the underlying mental... Let's answer that straight ahead and talk about the Iran 400 million.
[01:29:44.026 --> 01:29:49.370]  Then we're going to shift gears into the mass murderer's father showing up at the Hillary rally.
[01:29:49.370 --> 01:29:50.771]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.771 --> 01:29:53.292]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.292 --> 01:29:55.974]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.188 --> 01:30:03.390]  This is Ashley Beckford for InfoWars.com.
[01:30:03.390 --> 01:30:04.991]  This is your tip of the week.
[01:30:04.991 --> 01:30:07.113]  Article from Mercola.com.
[01:30:07.113 --> 01:30:11.335]  Fluoride, the only drug intentionally added to your tap water.
[01:30:11.335 --> 01:30:20.161]  Fluoride is an endocrine-disrupting, neurotoxic, and bone-weakening substance that the FDA defines as a drug when used to prevent disease.
[01:30:20.161 --> 01:30:26.325]  Because unlike the minerals we need, humans have no known physiological requirement for fluoride.
[01:30:26.545 --> 01:30:34.690]  Sodium fluoride, long known as an effective roach poison, is added to tablets and drops for the purpose of preventing tooth decay.
[01:30:34.690 --> 01:30:38.313]  In short, sodium fluoride is not a nutritional supplement.
[01:30:38.313 --> 01:30:41.475]  It is a prescription drug, and a dangerous one.
[01:30:41.475 --> 01:30:53.182]  FDA recently announced that marketing fluoride drops and tablets for cavity prevention violates federal law because FDA never approved these products as either safe or effective.
[01:30:53.442 --> 01:30:55.043]  Don't use fluoride.
[01:30:55.043 --> 01:31:00.088]  Use the Alexa Pure Water Filter to remove contaminants from your water supply.
[01:31:00.088 --> 01:31:08.355]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the info war.

[01:31:59.710 --> 01:32:00.530]  Hey, everyone!
[01:32:00.530 --> 01:32:02.812]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[01:32:02.812 --> 01:32:06.654]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:32:06.654 --> 01:32:08.735]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[01:32:08.735 --> 01:32:19.021]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:32:19.021 --> 01:32:25.004]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[01:32:25.464 --> 01:32:40.401]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[01:32:40.421 --> 01:32:41.001]  I think so.
[01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:23.704]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:57.583 --> 01:33:58.624]  We are back live.
[01:33:58.624 --> 01:34:21.936]  Dr. Steve Kucinich, MD slash psychiatrist, a board certifying individual who's run entire federal facilities, treated presidents, you name it, went through a whole history earlier of how there's this long-term program, bipartisanly, of covering up serious illnesses, a lot of times because vice presidents and others want to basically be running the show.
[01:34:21.936 --> 01:34:23.897]  That means George Soros, I guess, in the case of Hillary.
[01:34:24.915 --> 01:34:26.899]  But Hillary is falling down.
[01:34:26.899 --> 01:34:30.306]  She suddenly doesn't know who she is at press conferences.
[01:34:30.306 --> 01:34:31.568]  She won't give press conferences.
[01:34:31.568 --> 01:34:36.518]  She spent off and on a year in a very secretive medical facility that deals with brain tumors.
[01:34:37.540 --> 01:34:43.686]  I wanted to play a brief clip before we shift gears to another subject with him, since he mentioned it, this Fox News clip from Hannity.
[01:34:43.686 --> 01:34:47.509]  What do Hillary Clinton's neurological records show?
[01:34:47.509 --> 01:34:56.657]  Not the ones she put out from her little family doctor, you know, in New York, that are just limited, but the real ones, the CAT scans, her true records.
[01:34:56.657 --> 01:34:57.058]  Here's a clip.
[01:34:58.197 --> 01:35:19.632]  The picture, which shows Hillary Clinton apparently needing assistance to climb a flight of stairs at a campaign stop back in February, was picked up by the Drudge Report, which posted this headline over the weekend, detailing Hillary Clinton's history with falls and speculating that the former Secretary of State could be experiencing a serious undisclosed medical condition.
[01:35:19.632 --> 01:35:21.834]  Earlier today, we reached out to the Clinton campaign for a statement.
[01:35:22.354 --> 01:35:25.376]  And a spokesman told us that the Drudge Report is shameful.
[01:35:25.376 --> 01:35:30.499]  And anyone who buys into that vitriol, including yours truly, is shameful as well.
[01:35:30.499 --> 01:35:31.780]  So shameful we are.
[01:35:31.780 --> 01:35:39.904]  Anyway, what was noticeably missing from the statement was any reference or rebuttal to the health issues that are alleged by Drudge and others.
[01:35:39.904 --> 01:35:44.947]  Jim Hoft in an article and, you know, Hillary's handler, I guess, called it a diazepam
[01:35:45.247 --> 01:35:46.368]  And what would that be for?
[01:35:46.368 --> 01:35:53.496]  So one of the things that happens after having concussion, usually within a year or so, all the symptoms should resolve.
[01:35:53.496 --> 01:35:58.883]  Occasionally you have a latent or delayed kind of post-concussion syndromes and seizures.
[01:35:58.883 --> 01:36:01.185]  Like traumatic head issues for a football player.
[01:36:01.185 --> 01:36:02.166]  That's exactly what it is.
[01:36:02.166 --> 01:36:04.109]  And that can come years down the road.
[01:36:04.109 --> 01:36:05.330]  She may have some of the symptoms.
[01:36:05.330 --> 01:36:06.251]  You think that's what you're seeing?
[01:36:06.411 --> 01:36:13.053]  Well, I certainly think that a traumatic brain injury with symptoms down the road is very, very likely here, especially since she had a blood clot on her brain.
[01:36:13.053 --> 01:36:16.034]  And as David was mentioning, that can actually lead to a seizure problem.
[01:36:16.034 --> 01:36:19.655]  Someone's carrying a pen that you would use in the case of a seizure.
[01:36:19.655 --> 01:36:20.756]  A Valium pen?
[01:36:20.756 --> 01:36:22.136]  That makes me wonder about that.
[01:36:22.136 --> 01:36:24.117]  We need to see her records to see.
[01:36:24.117 --> 01:36:24.877]  What's the sequelae?
[01:36:24.877 --> 01:36:26.298]  They want Donald Trump's tax break.
[01:36:26.298 --> 01:36:27.698]  There's two things we want from her.
[01:36:27.698 --> 01:36:30.559]  We want her speeches to Wall Street and the medical records in full.
[01:36:31.812 --> 01:36:32.553]  Well said!
[01:36:32.553 --> 01:36:56.333]  I mean, how is that shameful when she's falling down, she's obviously having seizures, she looks worse, she's got weird lesions, rotholes on her tongue in multiple shots, she either acts disoriented or like a crazy... I don't mean to be mean, I'm not a neurologist, I'm not a psychiatrist, I've seen Down Syndrome children when they are either really bummed out, depressed, or they get these euphoric, crazy things where they
[01:36:57.242 --> 01:36:59.924]  Look up and look like the Joker.
[01:36:59.924 --> 01:37:02.646]  I mean, she just acts like a crazy person.
[01:37:02.646 --> 01:37:08.690]  I mean, she acts like a crazy schizophrenic would, you know, at a four way stop in downtown Austin.
[01:37:08.690 --> 01:37:10.531]  And she looks like a bag lady with her.
[01:37:10.531 --> 01:37:12.152]  I mean, I'm not being mean here, folks.
[01:37:12.152 --> 01:37:15.455]  I'm telling you, she looks like a classically
[01:37:16.593 --> 01:37:17.353]  Insane person.
[01:37:17.353 --> 01:37:19.114]  Is that caused by a brain tumor?
[01:37:19.114 --> 01:37:21.415]  Is it caused by something else?
[01:37:21.415 --> 01:37:26.458]  I mean, everyone's just going with the story that, oh, she was in the hospital off and on for a year for a blood clot.
[01:37:26.458 --> 01:37:37.383]  Dr. Steve Pachinick, again, formerly a board-certifying psychiatrist, MD, former head of psychological warfare for the State Department, you know, a guy that ran entire medical facilities.
[01:37:37.383 --> 01:37:39.764]  I mean, snapshot of this.
[01:37:39.764 --> 01:37:41.105]  Dead reckoning.
[01:37:41.105 --> 01:37:43.326]  Is this a woman getting better from something or worse?
[01:37:44.485 --> 01:37:46.347]  There's no question she's worse.
[01:37:46.347 --> 01:37:48.128]  Let me say something.
[01:37:48.128 --> 01:37:50.470]  She's not schizophrenic.
[01:37:50.470 --> 01:37:51.971]  Let me put the correct words.
[01:37:51.971 --> 01:37:54.093]  I know you're saying it in your lay terms.
[01:37:54.093 --> 01:38:03.061]  And remember, they're going to accuse us, you and me, of being conspiratorial since we've been doing this since 2001.
[01:38:03.061 --> 01:38:04.141]  Sure, I totally understand.
[01:38:04.141 --> 01:38:05.463]  I'm saying I'm a lay person.
[01:38:05.463 --> 01:38:08.645]  I'm saying she just... Alex, I'm not apologizing.
[01:38:08.645 --> 01:38:11.868]  All I'm saying to your audience is, when we first said
[01:38:12.679 --> 01:38:15.241]  That 9-11 was a stand-down.
[01:38:15.241 --> 01:38:17.002]  Everybody said we were crazy.
[01:38:17.002 --> 01:38:19.723]  And now it's come out.
[01:38:19.723 --> 01:38:22.765]  And now we know it was true.
[01:38:22.765 --> 01:38:36.653]  In the same way I'm saying, as I said 13-14 years ago, Hillary Clinton, and I wish her no illness, I've known her before, I've met her, she's a good mother, and Bill Clinton was a good mother to Chelsea.
[01:38:36.653 --> 01:38:38.694]  I happen to know that.
[01:38:38.694 --> 01:38:41.776]  But the reality is, when you see her now,
[01:38:42.526 --> 01:38:58.023]  For whatever reason, as a physician, as somebody who is an official within the State Department and still helps our government for free and cares about our presidency, I have nothing against Hillary per se.
[01:38:58.023 --> 01:39:04.610]  I'm just simply stating that her history of sociopathy, her history of ongoing denial
[01:39:05.149 --> 01:39:12.111]  And distortion, particularly when Chris Wallace interviewed her and said, you're lying.
[01:39:12.111 --> 01:39:27.334]  Everything you said about Comey was the reverse, can manifest itself as confabulation, as an issue within herself of having a history of severe concussions, three to four times possibly.
[01:39:27.734 --> 01:39:29.635]  We know it's in 1998.
[01:39:29.635 --> 01:39:31.356]  We know it's in 2009.
[01:39:31.356 --> 01:39:41.740]  We know for in 2012, Bill Clinton even stated clearly she was in the hospital for six months under the care of physicians and surgeons.
[01:39:41.740 --> 01:39:43.421]  Here is what has to be done.
[01:39:43.421 --> 01:39:51.925]  Physicians and surgeons must open their record, not because they're doctors and not because they're sanctimonious and not because they're Hippolytics.
[01:39:52.526 --> 01:40:02.092]  We have to open those records because the state of the nation, and possibly the world, depends on what her mental health is and her medical condition.
[01:40:02.092 --> 01:40:02.452]  That's right.
[01:40:02.452 --> 01:40:07.455]  When you want to be the President of the United States, you then make yourself open to the public.
[01:40:07.455 --> 01:40:13.198]  Things that were private now must be public because you now represent us, and I certainly agree.
[01:40:13.198 --> 01:40:17.400]  So in closing, if you have to dead reckon, Dr. Petranek, I'm going to spend a few minutes on another issue and then let you go.
[01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:17.881]  I know you're busy.
[01:40:18.835 --> 01:40:21.256]  No, let me say the second part.
[01:40:21.256 --> 01:40:32.781]  There's no question the Secret Service has to be brought before Congress to assess under oath what they have done and what they have seen.
[01:40:32.781 --> 01:40:37.423]  Not one of these things where they remain there for 10 years and then they write their books.
[01:40:37.423 --> 01:40:40.744]  That's not going to be acceptable.
[01:40:40.744 --> 01:40:45.326]  The Secret Service will be indicted for collusion in terms of
[01:40:46.027 --> 01:40:49.109]  Creating a problem for the United States of America.
[01:40:49.109 --> 01:40:54.031]  Their loyalty is to the people of the United States, not to the presidency.
[01:40:54.031 --> 01:41:00.354]  Either they're funded by us and they respond to our requests, or we defund them.
[01:41:00.354 --> 01:41:07.278]  There is no question the Secret Service for 50 to 60 years has cover up major malfeasance
[01:41:07.998 --> 01:41:09.940]  And malpractice that occurred.
[01:41:09.940 --> 01:41:13.402]  Well, look, they want to expose Hillary and others.
[01:41:13.402 --> 01:41:14.163]  It's the same thing.
[01:41:14.163 --> 01:41:15.844]  They covered up for John F. Kennedy.
[01:41:15.844 --> 01:41:17.166]  They covered up for Reagan.
[01:41:17.166 --> 01:41:20.008]  They covered up for a whole group of people.
[01:41:20.008 --> 01:41:25.292]  If that's, in fact, what they do, then they are in collusion with malfeasance.
[01:41:25.292 --> 01:41:25.953]  No, I hear you.
[01:41:25.953 --> 01:41:28.415]  But bottom line, we need to get these documents out.
[01:41:28.415 --> 01:41:29.015]  Correct.
[01:41:29.015 --> 01:41:30.817]  And I think it's becoming a major issue.
[01:41:30.817 --> 01:41:34.780]  And clearly Trump is dead even in the real polls.
[01:41:34.780 --> 01:41:35.981]  They're putting out fake polls.
[01:41:37.822 --> 01:41:47.248]  I mean, as a former top psychological warfare expert, a guy that's helped keep governments in power, overthrow foreign governments, people that don't know who you are, you're a rock star of that, probably more than anybody living.
[01:41:47.248 --> 01:41:59.977]  Dr. Steve Pchenik, looking at this election, just as a media analyst, I've never seen them photoshopping things, delisting Google, dirty tricks against Donald Trump.
[01:41:59.977 --> 01:42:01.298]  A, do you agree with that statement?
[01:42:01.298 --> 01:42:03.079]  And B, why are they pulling out all the stops?
[01:42:03.820 --> 01:42:10.166]  Because they're frightened, and also this is the modus operandi of the Clinton machinery.
[01:42:10.166 --> 01:42:11.767]  They have always been crooked.
[01:42:11.767 --> 01:42:19.874]  When Clinton came in the first time around, and I worked for Bush Sr., I said to one of my CIA operatives,
[01:42:20.393 --> 01:42:21.874]  What in fact happened?
[01:42:21.874 --> 01:42:37.880]  How did this guy from Arkansas, who nobody knew, we knew in the State Department that he was receiving money from mainland China, that was in 88-89, and my CIA operatives tell me he's been on the payroll of the Chinese and they stole the election.
[01:42:37.880 --> 01:42:41.061]  Remember the old Stalin statement?
[01:42:41.061 --> 01:42:46.723]  It's not how many people vote or who votes, it's the person who counts the votes.
[01:42:46.723 --> 01:42:49.044]  And whether they adopted the machinery,
[01:42:49.580 --> 01:42:55.275]  Whether they haven't doctored it, they are completely complicit in malfeasance activities.
[01:42:55.275 --> 01:42:56.318]  They know it.
[01:42:56.318 --> 01:42:56.960]  Let me tell you this.
[01:42:58.146 --> 01:43:00.907]  I can't go see a movie like The Martian.
[01:43:00.907 --> 01:43:03.449]  No, it's a waste of time.
[01:43:03.449 --> 01:43:06.070]  I can't go see the new Star Trek movie, none of them.
[01:43:06.070 --> 01:43:23.219]  Every major action movie or sci-fi movie is how great the Communist Chinese are, with Politburos, red flags, the starlet girl is a Communist Chinese colonel, we get our rocket boosters in The Martian from the Communist Chinese to save our mission because we're idiots.
[01:43:23.219 --> 01:43:25.540]  I mean, it's like Hollywood has become
[01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:28.402]  Because that's how you know who you're working for.
[01:43:28.402 --> 01:43:39.031]  I mean, Hollywood, now, when I see almost any movie, there is red Chinese propaganda in it, and this just started happening two years ago, and let me tell you, it is freaking me out.
[01:43:39.031 --> 01:43:40.733]  Well, I wouldn't worry about Hollywood.
[01:43:40.733 --> 01:43:45.757]  Having been a producer, and I'm part of the Producers Guild, Hollywood is finished.
[01:43:45.757 --> 01:43:49.981]  They have no more capability to develop films than the past.
[01:43:49.981 --> 01:43:53.244]  Now, I agree with you, but since when did the red Chinese start running it?
[01:43:53.641 --> 01:44:02.429]  Well, that's not the issue as much as the fact that nobody's going to movies and the millennials are now streaming all of the content.
[01:44:02.429 --> 01:44:04.691]  So let's not worry about Hollywood.
[01:44:04.691 --> 01:44:17.343]  What we have to worry about now is the fact that now, and let's get into the 400 million, I had the four horsemen of the apocalypse, Obama, Comey, Brennan.
[01:44:18.496 --> 01:44:31.364]  Three horsemen go in and carry and give a ransom of $400 million, part of a $1.7 billion ransom for four Americans held in Iran.
[01:44:31.364 --> 01:44:32.725]  You know how criminal that is?
[01:44:32.725 --> 01:44:34.366]  That's treason.
[01:44:34.366 --> 01:44:43.452]  If I had done that over the past 30 to 40 years as the head of counterterrorism and international hostage negotiation, I would have been in prison for that.
[01:44:44.463 --> 01:44:48.704]  And believe me, the FBI would be more than happy to hand me subpoenas.
[01:44:48.704 --> 01:45:02.027]  But when the head of the FBI, the head of the CIA, the President of the United States and John Kerry pay ransom money basically to keep the Iranians quiet of $1.7 billion.
[01:45:02.027 --> 01:45:06.948]  Isn't it like Roger Kipling said in that poem that once you pay the pirate, you must do it over and over again?
[01:45:06.948 --> 01:45:07.568]  Correct.
[01:45:07.568 --> 01:45:08.748]  You never stop.
[01:45:08.748 --> 01:45:12.869]  And the Iranians have continuously, they took two more hostages after that.
[01:45:13.470 --> 01:45:17.417]  And so once again, they're going through this action of paying off.
[01:45:17.417 --> 01:45:20.022]  But everybody knows you don't pay off people.
[01:45:20.022 --> 01:45:21.224]  Why do they do it?
[01:45:21.224 --> 01:45:24.089]  Because they're cowardly and because they're inept.
[01:45:24.662 --> 01:45:27.263]  And I can't tell you how inept they really are.
[01:45:27.263 --> 01:45:29.504]  Comey has failed repeatedly.
[01:45:29.504 --> 01:45:31.746]  He failed to indict Hillary.
[01:45:31.746 --> 01:45:34.347]  He failed to really handle the FBI.
[01:45:34.347 --> 01:45:42.911]  What did you make of that schizophrenic speech where he indicts her, she's horrible, she's lied, she's evil, but then no one will go after her?
[01:45:42.911 --> 01:45:44.432]  I mean, what did you make of his speech?
[01:45:44.432 --> 01:45:53.276]  Well, the point of the speech was that he made a very serious mistake when he had General Petraeus, who had given over eight notebooks
[01:45:53.860 --> 01:46:01.447]  To his mistress, and had committed a crime that was a felony, and then Petraeus, on top of that, lied.
[01:46:01.447 --> 01:46:05.631]  So what did Comey and, at that time, Eric Holder do?
[01:46:05.631 --> 01:46:07.233]  They made him a misdemeanor.
[01:46:07.233 --> 01:46:13.679]  As a result of that, he said that no efficient prosecutor can indict her.
[01:46:13.679 --> 01:46:16.021]  What he meant was that he messed up.
[01:46:16.021 --> 01:46:17.943]  Once again, Comey has to resign.
[01:46:18.450 --> 01:46:24.255]  Because he messed up not only once under Petraeus, he messed up again under Hillary Clinton.
[01:46:24.255 --> 01:46:32.702]  And you can't have an FBI that could not indict a woman like that because of the issue that they had already messed up under Petraeus.
[01:46:32.702 --> 01:46:37.266]  So what we have is compounding mistakes again and again and again.
[01:46:37.266 --> 01:46:38.046]  Alright, I hear you.
[01:46:38.046 --> 01:46:40.848]  Well, Dr. Steve Pachinick, simply amazing info.
[01:46:40.848 --> 01:46:42.530]  Anytime you want to come on, just call Nico.
[01:46:42.530 --> 01:46:43.811]  We'd love to get you on.
[01:46:43.811 --> 01:46:47.514]  Thank you for the opportunity and God bless your audience.
[01:46:47.574 --> 01:46:48.595]  Let me just say one more thing.
[01:46:48.595 --> 01:46:52.217]  You offered a couple years ago to fly to Austin and to be in studio.
[01:46:52.217 --> 01:46:54.218]  I know your face hasn't been seen in forever.
[01:46:54.218 --> 01:46:57.780]  We could do like Drudge and have you over there in the corner blacked out.
[01:46:57.780 --> 01:47:01.322]  But I want to get you a plane ticket here in the next month or so if you want to do it.
[01:47:01.322 --> 01:47:05.484]  Come to Austin and check out the facility after us talking on air for 15 years.
[01:47:05.484 --> 01:47:06.785]  It's 15 now, Doc.
[01:47:06.785 --> 01:47:07.125]  Almost 15.
[01:47:07.125 --> 01:47:07.565]  I know.
[01:47:07.565 --> 01:47:09.126]  And we've had a good friendship.
[01:47:09.126 --> 01:47:10.347]  Let's keep it that way.
[01:47:10.347 --> 01:47:12.368]  Otherwise, you don't want to see my face.
[01:47:14.028 --> 01:47:15.809]  Okay, well, before you said you wanted to come to Austin.
[01:47:15.809 --> 01:47:16.589]  Remember that?
[01:47:16.589 --> 01:47:22.832]  Well, yeah, a long time ago, but now I'm happy just being in the rural South and working with my people.
[01:47:22.832 --> 01:47:26.594]  But the truth of the matter is, let's get the medical records out.
[01:47:26.594 --> 01:47:30.135]  And the doctors on Fox News were absolutely correct.
[01:47:30.135 --> 01:47:31.876]  They're both excellent doctors.
[01:47:31.876 --> 01:47:33.217]  One works at Mount Sinai.
[01:47:33.217 --> 01:47:35.378]  The other one's a famous internist.
[01:47:35.378 --> 01:47:39.600]  And like them, I said, let's get the medical records and find out what this is all about.
[01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:42.721]  And I thank you, Alex, for the opportunity to talk.
[01:47:42.961 --> 01:47:43.802]  Thank you.
[01:47:43.802 --> 01:47:51.348]  Just in closing in 60 seconds, I think even if the establishment steals this election, which they're trying to set up right now with fake polls, that it's the end though.
[01:47:51.348 --> 01:47:53.609]  I mean, they're really showing their cards.
[01:47:53.609 --> 01:48:03.997]  They've got a obviously collapsing, degenerating, it's very sad, rotting woman, who they're foisting like a dead, dead king, you know, up in his chair.
[01:48:05.758 --> 01:48:09.600]  And, you know, the El Cid trick worked for about 30 seconds, you know, where he rides out against the Moors.
[01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:16.162]  But in the real world, you can't have a corpse in the White House for too long, especially in the age of the Internet.
[01:48:16.162 --> 01:48:20.163]  And if the Secret Service and others think they can cover this up for a long time, I think they're wrong.
[01:48:20.163 --> 01:48:24.185]  What do you think all this craziness signifies, Dr. Steve Pucinich of StevePucinich.com?
[01:48:24.648 --> 01:48:37.135]  Well, we're on the process of a republic which has been led over 30 years by incompetent presidents of the United States who are not qualified, including Obama.
[01:48:37.135 --> 01:48:38.695]  I said it from the very beginning.
[01:48:38.695 --> 01:48:39.516]  He was a liar.
[01:48:39.516 --> 01:48:41.297]  He was a sociopath.
[01:48:41.297 --> 01:48:46.079]  He would lie all the way through the White House and couldn't care less.
[01:48:46.079 --> 01:48:47.660]  The same thing with Bush Jr.
[01:48:47.660 --> 01:48:49.121]  and the same thing with Bill Clinton.
[01:48:50.171 --> 01:48:56.042]  The only thing, I'm not here to promote Trump, although I favor Trump for one simple reason.
[01:48:56.042 --> 01:48:58.126]  He's had a business experience.
[01:48:58.661 --> 01:49:01.243]  He's going to clean out whatever there is.
[01:49:01.243 --> 01:49:05.166]  As to what his personality is, I could care less.
[01:49:05.166 --> 01:49:15.115]  You're a board-certifying psychiatrist from Harvard and a former head of counterterrorism and a commando before that, so I think you're certified to tell us what you really think of Trump.
[01:49:15.115 --> 01:49:16.096]  What do you think of his psychology?
[01:49:16.096 --> 01:49:18.678]  Because I read these big psychology things in Atlantic Monthly.
[01:49:18.678 --> 01:49:27.305]  You know, like all of us, we're a bit narcissistic, but I think Trump has been able to advance despite the problems they had of him.
[01:49:27.825 --> 01:49:33.211]  And he was courageous enough to go forth and said, look, I want to be President of the United States.
[01:49:33.211 --> 01:49:35.313]  He's the first businessman we've ever had.
[01:49:35.313 --> 01:49:36.314]  He's not out to get America.
[01:49:36.314 --> 01:49:39.537]  I mean, you heard my analysis that he's not out to get us.
[01:49:39.537 --> 01:49:48.486]  No, he wants, if anything, I think he wants, and he picked a very good man in Michael Pence, he wants to get forth and clean out the entire establishment.
[01:49:48.823 --> 01:49:55.312]  That's totally corrupt, including the Clintons, the Republicans, the FBI, the CIA, the DNI.
[01:49:55.312 --> 01:49:56.954]  I mean, Michael Hayden.
[01:49:56.954 --> 01:49:58.256]  And then he wants to get in.
[01:49:58.840 --> 01:50:04.845]  Clean it out, and he would be more than happy to give it over to Pence and to the people that he brings into the government.
[01:50:04.845 --> 01:50:07.007]  Well, you just showed the inside baseball.
[01:50:07.007 --> 01:50:09.109]  Truth is, Trump doesn't want to do any of this.
[01:50:09.109 --> 01:50:12.051]  He just wants to fix it and get out and go play golf.
[01:50:12.051 --> 01:50:12.712]  That's exactly right.
[01:50:12.712 --> 01:50:14.213]  You know the inside baseball, don't you?
[01:50:14.213 --> 01:50:14.994]  Because that's the truth.
[01:50:14.994 --> 01:50:16.495]  Trump doesn't even want to be president.
[01:50:16.495 --> 01:50:19.197]  He just can't sit there and watch this happen.
[01:50:19.197 --> 01:50:24.202]  He's doing it simply because it's a mandate that he felt he needed to do and just clean it out.
[01:50:24.202 --> 01:50:24.922]  But he's correct.
[01:50:25.823 --> 01:50:31.266]  Hillary correctly, he read the problems correctly, he stated that we have a rigged election.
[01:50:31.266 --> 01:50:35.369]  Bernie unfortunately left and was overwhelmed and couldn't continue.
[01:50:35.369 --> 01:50:38.411]  Well, they're pretty freaked out because they know and it's not a secret.
[01:50:38.411 --> 01:50:42.073]  I mean, Trump's a listener, been a listener for a long time and they're really upset about it.
[01:50:42.073 --> 01:50:43.014]  Dr. Pachinik, thank you.
[01:50:43.014 --> 01:50:45.135]  StevePachinik.com, all your great books and material.
[01:50:45.135 --> 01:50:50.098]  Let's catch up for an hour soon about the great book about your mom, just from a historical perspective.
[01:50:50.538 --> 01:50:51.679]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:50:51.679 --> 01:50:52.319]  There he goes.
[01:50:52.319 --> 01:50:59.622]  Joe Big has got, thank you, big news on this mass murder at the Gay Night Club, showing up at the Hillary rally.
[01:50:59.622 --> 01:51:00.443]  Stay with us.
[01:51:00.443 --> 01:51:04.645]  By now, you know the smart way to buy emergency food storage is calories per dollar.

[01:51:11.988 --> 01:51:15.170]  You need 2,000 calories per day under ideal conditions.
[01:51:15.170 --> 01:51:18.872]  Most 30-day kits don't have enough calories to sustain you for more than a week.
[01:51:18.872 --> 01:51:21.513]  They just don't have enough nutrition to do the job.
[01:51:21.513 --> 01:51:24.775]  See the comparisons for yourself at ReadySupplyFoods.com.
[01:51:24.775 --> 01:51:27.177]  We're the new leader in value and quality.

[01:51:59.921 --> 01:52:04.685]  To a professional trader in precious metals, the key is spot price.
[01:52:04.685 --> 01:52:09.949]  Spot price is market price, what gold or silver actually costs on the exchange.
[01:52:09.949 --> 01:52:15.173]  Regular people looking to invest never get spot price because resellers add fees for everything.
[01:52:15.453 --> 01:52:18.756]  Refining, minting, brokerage costs, commissions.
[01:52:18.756 --> 01:52:21.318]  The public is never offered spot price.
[01:52:21.318 --> 01:52:22.799]  Until now.

[01:52:38.251 --> 01:52:40.992]  Not a piece of paper from Wall Street or a bank.
[01:52:40.992 --> 01:52:44.374]  A 10-ounce bar of silver at spot price.
[01:52:44.374 --> 01:52:46.235]  That's a solid investment.
[01:52:46.235 --> 01:52:47.536]  But you must act now.

[01:52:58.441 --> 01:52:59.202]  50 United States only.

[01:53:13.069 --> 01:53:14.850]  And now introducing Trauma Pads.

[01:53:27.316 --> 01:53:28.317]  Come and take it.
[01:53:29.457 --> 01:53:34.240]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:40.124]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[01:53:40.124 --> 01:53:46.628]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[01:53:46.628 --> 01:53:50.671]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.
[01:53:50.671 --> 01:53:56.935]  For the finest in survival cooking stoves and fire starters made right here in the USA, go to MinutemanStove.com.
[01:53:56.935 --> 01:53:58.676]  That's MinutemanStove.com.
[01:54:00.977 --> 01:54:14.542]  That's right, we can see for miles and miles and miles and miles.
[01:54:14.542 --> 01:54:20.444]  I don't get up here and attack Hillary as a dirty trick to say she's obviously completely ill.
[01:54:20.444 --> 01:54:23.645]  I mean, you can look at her, she looks like she's in bad shape.
[01:54:24.915 --> 01:54:28.758]  But for me it's the bigger issue that her and Bill have been communist Chinese spies forever.
[01:54:28.758 --> 01:54:35.263]  You've heard it from Dr. Steve Pchenik, who was the former head of counter-terrorism for the United States, for the U.S.
[01:54:35.263 --> 01:54:36.944]  Army and more.
[01:54:36.944 --> 01:54:42.228]  And the entire structure that isn't traitors knows that this country is in so much trouble.
[01:54:43.468 --> 01:55:06.797]  I mean, it really is crazy, and now we've got this exercise of Hillary going and blaming the Second Amendment for what happened in Orlando, and there in the crowd, you've got the father, Sadiq Matin, of Omar Matin, who killed 50-plus people, and then he goes on the news and is arrogant and proud of it, and then Hillary spins it and says, oh, he wasn't invited when they were in the vetted group.
[01:55:06.797 --> 01:55:08.777]  Joe Biggs has covered many Hillary rallies.
[01:55:08.777 --> 01:55:10.118]  He's got the documentation, Joe Biggs.
[01:55:11.069 --> 01:55:15.333]  Yeah, so I want to go back to the mental state of Hillary Clinton really quick if we can.
[01:55:15.333 --> 01:55:17.975]  My grandmother died of Alzheimer's.
[01:55:17.975 --> 01:55:19.997]  My great-grandmother died of Alzheimer's.
[01:55:19.997 --> 01:55:25.141]  And it all started with falling down, forgetting who people were, twitching, things like that.
[01:55:25.141 --> 01:55:29.185]  So it definitely looks like she almost has an onset of Alzheimer's in a sense.
[01:55:29.185 --> 01:55:30.646]  Like there's definitely something going on.
[01:55:30.646 --> 01:55:32.168]  That's what Bochenek said, plus brain tumor.
[01:55:32.808 --> 01:55:35.169]  I mean, that's definitely a possibility.
[01:55:35.169 --> 01:55:38.831]  Now, with what happened in Orlando, she actually spoke at a rally in Kissimmee.
[01:55:38.831 --> 01:55:43.673]  I actually retweeted some video just a minute ago from this girl who was in Kissimmee at the rally.
[01:55:43.673 --> 01:55:44.954]  She's a Trump supporter.
[01:55:44.954 --> 01:55:46.715]  And what they actually did is they fudged the numbers.
[01:55:46.715 --> 01:55:49.616]  This is a room, a building, that held about 3,000 people.
[01:55:49.616 --> 01:55:55.499]  They actually moved the walls in and tightened it up so it looked like there was a ton of people in there when they filmed.
[01:55:55.499 --> 01:55:57.660]  And the back area was completely wide open.
[01:55:58.200 --> 01:56:01.001]  Pitches up on your Rambo bags.
[01:56:01.001 --> 01:56:06.062]  It's also in our article that's on DrugsReport.com, Infowars.com, breaking that down.
[01:56:06.062 --> 01:56:06.822]  It's crazy.
[01:56:06.822 --> 01:56:09.702]  But she can't even, in Omaha, she can't even fill up a rally.
[01:56:09.702 --> 01:56:11.843]  They had to bring in high school kids to fill it up.
[01:56:11.843 --> 01:56:18.064]  You know, there's multiple areas where no one's coming out, but they want to tell you that she's leading in the polls and more people are for her.
[01:56:18.064 --> 01:56:26.686]  When in fact, when you go to Trump rallies, there are thousands upon thousands of people and people mile long wrapped around the buildings to go hear this man speak, but no one is for her.
[01:56:26.906 --> 01:56:28.408]  How do they think they're going to pull this off?
[01:56:28.408 --> 01:56:33.052]  I mean, they admit they're adding 15% more Democrats to poll samples to give her a lead.
[01:56:33.052 --> 01:56:35.635]  It's pure bull... How dumb do they think we are?
[01:56:35.635 --> 01:56:37.397]  What is it, Pennsylvania?
[01:56:37.397 --> 01:56:39.699]  60,000 people switched over from Democrat to Republican to vote for Clinton.
[01:56:39.699 --> 01:56:40.140]  Oh, it's fortunate.
[01:56:40.140 --> 01:56:41.121]  And they're going to try to steal it.
[01:56:41.121 --> 01:56:41.621]  And I tell you...
[01:56:42.322 --> 01:56:45.344]  They got the new Fox News director for Ailes.
[01:56:45.344 --> 01:56:46.865]  He was on this morning.
[01:56:46.865 --> 01:56:47.565]  Oh, it's true.
[01:56:47.565 --> 01:56:48.986]  Hillary's going to win by 12 points.
[01:56:48.986 --> 01:56:50.247]  He's this real nelly guy.
[01:56:50.247 --> 01:56:51.247]  And don't listen to others.
[01:56:51.247 --> 01:56:52.788]  These unhealthy polls.
[01:56:52.788 --> 01:56:58.412]  He was... I mean, they are really... They had to take Fox down, though, so that they couldn't challenge it.
[01:56:58.852 --> 01:57:02.794]  Well, yeah, if you start watching Fox now, you start seeing they're starting to lean more towards Clinton.
[01:57:02.794 --> 01:57:07.397]  Every time you hear these guys, except for Sean Hannity, it's all like, oh, it's not so bad.
[01:57:07.397 --> 01:57:09.939]  Well, I'm not going to get Hannity in trouble, but he did reach out to us.
[01:57:09.939 --> 01:57:10.679]  He said, great job.
[01:57:10.679 --> 01:57:11.339]  We appreciate you.
[01:57:11.339 --> 01:57:12.640]  I'm trying my best.
[01:57:12.640 --> 01:57:14.541]  They're threatening to fire him right now.
[01:57:14.541 --> 01:57:16.422]  So he reached out to us and said he appreciates us.
[01:57:18.161 --> 01:57:19.883]  I just, this country's in deep crap, brother.
[01:57:19.883 --> 01:57:21.724]  They are cooing Fox News.
[01:57:21.724 --> 01:57:23.606]  But you look- They got fake polls out.
[01:57:23.606 --> 01:57:27.810]  They got Fox this morning on three different shows I watched going, oh, he's always been behind Hillary.
[01:57:27.810 --> 01:57:29.491]  He's going to lose by 12 points, yeah.
[01:57:29.491 --> 01:57:30.712]  But it's the top story.
[01:57:30.712 --> 01:57:33.214]  They go, well, David Duke endorsed Trump.
[01:57:33.214 --> 01:57:34.395]  And then he goes, well, I disavowed him.
[01:57:34.395 --> 01:57:35.496]  They're like, well, are you going to disavow him?
[01:57:35.496 --> 01:57:36.517]  He's like, well, I just did it.
[01:57:36.517 --> 01:57:37.858]  How many times do I have to do it?
[01:57:37.858 --> 01:57:40.601]  And then she brings out Khan to the DNC to speak.
[01:57:41.181 --> 01:57:44.663]  This guy says that Sharia law should be held over all other laws.
[01:57:44.663 --> 01:57:46.604]  He's just like Sadiq Matin!
[01:57:46.604 --> 01:57:55.869]  Yeah, and now you have Sadiq Matin, the father of Omar Matin, the Orlando Pulse nightclub killer, and they're saying, well, we didn't invite him.
[01:57:55.869 --> 01:57:57.389]  He wasn't asked to be here.
[01:57:57.389 --> 01:57:59.270]  Well, I've been to tons of these rallies before.
[01:57:59.270 --> 01:58:07.695]  When I'm able to come in this press, that row behind where the presidential candidate speaks is already full before they let in the main public who have been waiting to have tickets.
[01:58:08.055 --> 01:58:09.096]  That's admitted.
[01:58:09.096 --> 01:58:11.758]  It's always vetted, trusted Democrat turds.
[01:58:11.758 --> 01:58:14.960]  Yeah, now if he was in the regular crowd standing up, then I could understand.
[01:58:14.960 --> 01:58:18.222]  You know, maybe he just got one of those regular emails and decided to show up.
[01:58:18.222 --> 01:58:26.448]  But he was standing behind a presidential frontrunner for the Democratic Party, right there, smiling, waving, all happy and excited.
[01:58:27.403 --> 01:58:28.904]  This is who's in her corner.
[01:58:28.904 --> 01:58:30.245]  So, what's the message?
[01:58:30.245 --> 01:58:31.966]  They're obviously doing this on purpose.
[01:58:31.966 --> 01:58:35.348]  This is like a message to people out there, hey, bring anybody in.
[01:58:35.348 --> 01:58:38.611]  I want to talk about a statement when we get back that he made that I think is very important.
[01:58:38.611 --> 01:58:41.472]  Yeah, stay with us at fullworks.com forward slash show.
[01:58:41.472 --> 01:58:43.254]  Stations across the country, spread the word.
[01:58:43.254 --> 01:58:45.075]  Don't take this transmission for granted, folks.
[01:58:50.035 --> 01:58:53.996]  Secret 12, InfoWarsLife's Vitamin B12 formulation.
[01:58:53.996 --> 01:59:00.297]  Most forms of Vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[01:59:00.297 --> 01:59:07.599]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[01:59:07.599 --> 01:59:16.381]  InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[01:59:16.701 --> 01:59:22.862]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[01:59:22.862 --> 01:59:27.703]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[01:59:27.703 --> 01:59:31.284]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[01:59:31.284 --> 01:59:33.184]  No needles, no injections.
[01:59:33.184 --> 01:59:34.825]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:59:34.825 --> 01:59:36.025]  Try it for yourself.
[01:59:36.025 --> 01:59:38.345]  Discover the secret, Secret 12.

[01:59:46.747 --> 01:59:48.609]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:11.476 --> 02:00:16.998]  Long way from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:16.998 --> 02:00:25.861]  It is a long way to the top of the fight against the globalists, but I'm telling you, to quote Martin Luther King, I have seen the kingdom.
[02:00:25.861 --> 02:00:30.123]  I know where we're going in the animating contest of liberty.
[02:00:30.123 --> 02:00:35.745]  And the collectivists, the globalists, know we're struggling out of their grip.
[02:00:35.745 --> 02:00:37.666]  And they are pulling the stops out.
[02:00:37.666 --> 02:00:40.887]  Folks, if Trump was really behind in polls, I'd tell you.
[02:00:42.979 --> 02:00:45.822]  If any of their BS was real, I'd say the public's pathetic.
[02:00:45.822 --> 02:00:47.924]  They're idiots like I did 10 years ago.
[02:00:47.924 --> 02:00:49.345]  What's wrong with you people?
[02:00:49.345 --> 02:00:50.947]  They're not!
[02:00:50.947 --> 02:00:51.507]  Trump gets $20,000.
[02:00:51.507 --> 02:00:52.508]  Sanders gets $20,000.
[02:00:52.508 --> 02:00:53.049]  Hillary gets $179,000.
[02:00:56.311 --> 02:00:59.433]  We can't fine people at exit polls for Hillary in the primaries.
[02:00:59.433 --> 02:01:00.714]  They stole it!
[02:01:00.714 --> 02:01:01.715]  Joe Biggs is here with us.
[02:01:01.715 --> 02:01:16.505]  When I was in Long Beach, California, a bulk of the people that were waiting in line to go into Long Beach to that community college to hear Clinton speak were Trump supporters or Bernie supporters who just wanted to go hear her lie in person to see if it's really as bad as what they've seen in videos.
[02:01:16.505 --> 02:01:18.446]  A man does not look into the Gorgon and live.
[02:01:18.846 --> 02:01:22.850]  I mean, most people aren't going out here because they really believe in what she's saying.
[02:01:22.850 --> 02:01:27.755]  They're doing it for the circus, the show, to be like, alright man, I hear a lie, but I want to see in person.
[02:01:27.755 --> 02:01:29.777]  Exactly, and then on those days she gets a thousand.
[02:01:29.777 --> 02:01:38.846]  So what does this mean that they admit in different polls, they're running every scam you can imagine, or they'll do a third independence, they don't just randomly call numbers, who has landlines plus?
[02:01:39.306 --> 02:01:41.167]  They know who they're calling before they call.
[02:01:41.167 --> 02:01:47.512]  They'll have a third independent, a third Democrat, a third Republican, and they'll poll them, but then all the independents are basically Democrats already.
[02:01:47.512 --> 02:01:49.754]  Or they admit they sampled 50% more Democrats.
[02:01:49.754 --> 02:01:51.335]  I mean, it's admitted fraud.
[02:01:51.335 --> 02:01:53.977]  And the whole media just goes along like it's okay, Joe.
[02:01:53.977 --> 02:01:57.599]  Oh, it's complete and total fraud, because I go to all these events.
[02:01:57.599 --> 02:02:00.442]  I can hardly find a Hillary Clinton supporter.
[02:02:00.442 --> 02:02:04.424]  At the DNC, for instance, the only Clinton supporters were inside, really.
[02:02:05.330 --> 02:02:09.056]  Meanwhile, they're not even talking about the massive amount of chaos going on.
[02:02:09.056 --> 02:02:12.402]  The Sanders supporters are upset about having the nomination stolen.
[02:02:12.402 --> 02:02:13.984]  If you wear a Hillary shirt, they attack you.
[02:02:13.984 --> 02:02:14.565]  Oh, they did.
[02:02:14.565 --> 02:02:15.967]  They did that to people.
[02:02:17.165 --> 02:02:18.885]  It's out of control.
[02:02:18.885 --> 02:02:20.226]  People do not like her.
[02:02:20.226 --> 02:02:22.086]  What do you think her real numbers are?
[02:02:22.086 --> 02:02:22.726]  I think it's like 10%.
[02:02:22.726 --> 02:02:24.747]  It's a big psy-op.
[02:02:24.747 --> 02:02:30.808]  You know, most people are going to watch the TV, they're going to look at it, they're going to believe it, and take it as, you know, the Ten Commandments.
[02:02:30.808 --> 02:02:37.209]  They're going to say, alright, well, Fox News said that this poll was this, or CNN or Rachel Maddow came out and said that this is the poll number.
[02:02:37.209 --> 02:02:44.731]  It's a psy-op to make the regular person, the sheep, the unwithheard, to come out there and go... You know how pissed they are that Trump listens to the show?
[02:02:45.922 --> 02:02:48.643]  I mean, it's not about me, it's dangerous.
[02:02:48.643 --> 02:02:50.083]  They are so freaked out.
[02:02:50.083 --> 02:02:53.965]  When I ran into Globalist at the RNC, they were just totally freaked.
[02:02:53.965 --> 02:02:56.025]  I mean, people are waking up.
[02:02:56.025 --> 02:02:58.186]  People are sick and tired of hearing this crap.
[02:02:58.186 --> 02:03:06.829]  You know, there's a lot of people I run into at all these events, and they go around, they save up, and they go to these events to talk to people and engage, and no one can find Hillary supporters.
[02:03:07.520 --> 02:03:11.406]  When you go to them, there's... We should do special reports like, in search of Hillary supporters.
[02:03:11.406 --> 02:03:13.009]  We can find a few at UT.
[02:03:13.009 --> 02:03:13.350]  Yeah.
[02:03:13.350 --> 02:03:15.213]  A few in the rich neighborhoods.
[02:03:15.213 --> 02:03:17.076]  That's how they, they're always so rich.
[02:03:17.076 --> 02:03:20.401]  Well, if you look at most of her rallies up until now, they've been private.
[02:03:21.348 --> 02:03:22.929]  She does them at rich people houses.
[02:03:22.929 --> 02:03:24.810]  Yeah, they do them at these billionaire houses.
[02:03:24.810 --> 02:03:26.470]  You have to spend like $20,000.
[02:03:26.470 --> 02:03:32.733]  And they shake your finger at us when there's a bunch of blue-collar folks who just want a better job saying we're elitists.
[02:03:32.733 --> 02:03:36.595]  Yeah, $7,000 to be able to be given the address to the place.
[02:03:36.595 --> 02:03:43.959]  Then $15,000 to sit down at the table beside her or in the vicinity to be around her highness.
[02:03:43.959 --> 02:03:47.500]  And then $20,000 to ask her a question privately or something like that.
[02:03:47.500 --> 02:03:48.741]  A woman wearing a diaper.
[02:03:49.537 --> 02:03:50.078]  Yeah, she looks like Mal.
[02:03:50.078 --> 02:03:54.042]  Nothing against diapers, but I mean, you know.
[02:03:54.042 --> 02:03:56.685]  I'm not normally for burgers, but I think she needs one.
[02:03:56.685 --> 02:03:57.065]  I wouldn't mind.
[02:03:57.065 --> 02:03:59.928]  Have you seen the new thing with the Teletubby outfits the Muslim women are wearing?
[02:03:59.928 --> 02:04:01.530]  The Bikini Girl outfits.
[02:04:01.530 --> 02:04:03.872]  But those are Bikini, these are like Teletubby outfits.
[02:04:03.872 --> 02:04:04.994]  Yeah, I saw that.
[02:04:04.994 --> 02:04:06.235]  The volleyball players.
[02:04:06.235 --> 02:04:06.735]  Yeah.
[02:04:06.735 --> 02:04:07.256]  Oh my God.
[02:04:10.114 --> 02:04:14.896]  Look, I get it if you want to wear conservative clothes and do all that.
[02:04:14.896 --> 02:04:15.996]  That's what I like in my family.
[02:04:15.996 --> 02:04:21.198]  I tell my daughters, hey, don't dress like you're trying to get a job, you know, at the local strip club.
[02:04:21.198 --> 02:04:24.319]  But at the same time, like, it's volleyball.
[02:04:24.319 --> 02:04:26.460]  Like, let the women be in bathing suits, you know?
[02:04:26.460 --> 02:04:26.620]  Yeah.
[02:04:26.620 --> 02:04:31.141]  You know, it's an interesting thing if we go back to this Kissimmee thing where... We will.
[02:04:31.141 --> 02:04:32.902]  We got another guest coming on the show.
[02:04:32.902 --> 02:04:33.782]  Ride shotgun with us.
[02:04:33.782 --> 02:04:34.002]  Okay.
[02:04:34.002 --> 02:04:35.143]  Thanks for the rest of the hour.
[02:04:35.143 --> 02:04:38.084]  And then Evan Knight's taking over and a lot more.
[02:04:39.557 --> 02:04:40.617]  Listen, here's the deal.
[02:04:40.617 --> 02:04:45.659]  I gotta laugh and make jokes about this or I'm gonna split my wrists.
[02:04:45.659 --> 02:04:47.040]  So, and I'm serious.
[02:04:47.040 --> 02:04:48.120]  I'm not gonna actually commit suicide.
[02:04:48.120 --> 02:04:48.740]  They'll kill me.
[02:04:48.740 --> 02:04:49.781]  It's a figure of speech.
[02:04:49.781 --> 02:04:54.883]  The point is, is that I don't think this is funny, but I have to make it funny or I can't handle it.
[02:04:54.883 --> 02:04:55.863]  Exactly.
[02:04:55.863 --> 02:04:57.564]  It's just hilarious.
[02:04:57.564 --> 02:04:58.024]  We'll be back.
[02:05:00.040 --> 02:05:02.161]  Joe Bates here with InfoWars.com.
[02:05:02.161 --> 02:05:05.483]  CNN bashes conspiratorial questions about Hillary's health.
[02:05:05.483 --> 02:05:13.306]  CNN is attempting to dismiss questions about Hillary Clinton's health by asserting that photos which appear to show her struggling to climb some steps are old.
[02:05:13.306 --> 02:05:23.091]  However, the news network conveniently fails to mention the fact that both federal and NYPD sources have blown the whistle on Hillary's difficulties with balance and walking in the past.
[02:05:23.351 --> 02:05:33.794]  Under the headline, Drudge Report Misleads Readers With Hillary Clinton Photo, CNN's Brian Settler writes that news aggregator Matt Drudge is taking a six-month-old photo out of context.
[02:05:33.794 --> 02:05:40.076]  Settler claims that the images merely show Hillary being aided after a slip and dismisses concerns about Hillary's health.
[02:05:40.076 --> 02:05:43.217]  In addition, the claims of John Cardio are not mentioned.
[02:05:43.217 --> 02:05:50.039]  Cardio told Breitbart about two different individuals, one a federal agent and another an NYPD officer who'd worked security
[02:05:50.299 --> 02:05:55.861]  At a Hillary event in New York City, who both personally witnessed Hillary's walking difficulties.
[02:05:55.861 --> 02:05:59.783]  This has been Joe Biggs with Infowars.com.
[02:05:59.783 --> 02:06:01.863]  BrainForce, it's completely different.
[02:06:01.863 --> 02:06:03.084]  Try a bottle of it.
[02:06:03.084 --> 02:06:04.684]  Rob Due joins us.
[02:06:04.684 --> 02:06:07.785]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[02:06:07.785 --> 02:06:08.906]  Tell us what BrainForce did.
[02:06:08.906 --> 02:06:09.826]  I'd been working all day.
[02:06:09.826 --> 02:06:12.327]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[02:06:12.327 --> 02:06:13.748]  I get in here at 830.
[02:06:13.748 --> 02:06:15.648]  I was kind of run down.
[02:06:15.648 --> 02:06:17.409]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[02:06:17.569 --> 02:06:19.470]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[02:06:19.470 --> 02:06:22.351]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there and popped two of them.
[02:06:22.351 --> 02:06:24.632]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing!
[02:06:24.632 --> 02:06:26.513]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[02:06:26.513 --> 02:06:28.073]  It's got four and a half stars.
[02:06:28.073 --> 02:06:29.414]  People really love it.
[02:06:29.414 --> 02:06:30.014]  Read about it.
[02:06:30.014 --> 02:06:33.856]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise.
[02:06:33.856 --> 02:06:39.118]  Because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[02:06:39.318 --> 02:06:43.342]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[02:06:43.342 --> 02:06:49.507]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[02:06:49.507 --> 02:06:55.392]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:06:59.719 --> 02:07:07.884]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but were waiting for an outrageously low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[02:07:07.884 --> 02:07:08.705]  Here's why.
[02:07:08.705 --> 02:07:12.847]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse.
[02:07:12.847 --> 02:07:13.768]  So please listen.
[02:07:13.768 --> 02:07:17.490]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[02:07:17.490 --> 02:07:23.854]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the sun.
[02:07:23.854 --> 02:07:27.977]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest,
[02:07:28.197 --> 02:07:31.138]  You're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[02:07:31.138 --> 02:07:33.498]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[02:07:33.498 --> 02:07:38.339]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast-charge solar generators.
[02:07:38.339 --> 02:07:45.061]  And they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low price for InfoWars listeners.
[02:07:45.061 --> 02:07:46.821]  So it's a good time to check it out.
[02:07:46.821 --> 02:07:48.502]  Go to gridwars.com.
[02:07:48.502 --> 02:07:50.242]  That's gridwars.com.
[02:07:50.242 --> 02:07:54.103]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[02:07:54.103 --> 02:07:55.664]  Go to gridwars.com.
[02:07:55.664 --> 02:07:57.024]  That's gridwars.com.
[02:08:10.413 --> 02:08:15.296]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:08:15.296 --> 02:08:17.577]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:17.577 --> 02:08:24.161]  You wake up.
[02:08:24.161 --> 02:08:26.923]  We have a guest joining us who is at the border.
[02:08:27.995 --> 02:08:30.197]  I believe it's Lithuanian going into Russia.
[02:08:30.197 --> 02:08:43.549]  There's a big convoy of Germans going into Russia in an attempt to draw attention to NATO and Merkel and the globalists moving tanks, weapons and nukes up to the border of Russia trying to start a new Cold War.
[02:08:43.549 --> 02:08:51.816]  We've got top mainline analysts here in the US admitting that all of this is actually going on and unfolding as well.
[02:08:51.816 --> 02:08:52.917]  We should probably play that clip.
[02:08:53.858 --> 02:09:04.205]  Uh, from one of the top Princeton professors from CNN, uh, from last week, where he illustrates the fact that they're saying Donald Trump is, you know, this communist agent.
[02:09:04.205 --> 02:09:07.848]  Russia's not even communist anymore, uh, because he doesn't want to have a war and wants to have detente.
[02:09:07.848 --> 02:09:11.591]  But Hillary does, uh, because she's so liberal, she's so cool.
[02:09:11.591 --> 02:09:16.294]  And Joe Biggs is obviously going to ride shotgun with us the rest of the hour, uh, after our guests leave us at the bottom of the hour.
[02:09:16.294 --> 02:09:17.254]  We're going to burrow in.
[02:09:18.342 --> 02:09:32.712]  To the father, Sadiq Mateen, of Omar Mateen, the gay nightclub pulse killer of more than 50 people, who shows up in the VIP area of the Hillary event, gets behind her on the stage, and then is on the local news.
[02:09:32.712 --> 02:09:36.115]  Joe is burrowing into this, researching this right now.
[02:09:36.115 --> 02:09:40.098]  Also at the same event, and at other events, they make the crowd look much larger.
[02:09:40.098 --> 02:09:41.459]  A thousand showed up to see Hillary.
[02:09:41.459 --> 02:09:41.559]  It's 179.
[02:09:44.189 --> 02:09:50.636]  According to the Secret Service, but she's the rock star that's going to win the election.
[02:09:50.636 --> 02:09:54.821]  Now, Max Bachmann is an independent journalist.
[02:09:54.821 --> 02:09:59.146]  He's got a TV program on national German television.
[02:09:59.146 --> 02:10:02.029]  And of course, he's also done reporting for InfoWars.com for Bilderberg.
[02:10:03.063 --> 02:10:09.746]  2015-2016 at Generalist.org.
[02:10:09.746 --> 02:10:12.427]  Twitter, the underscore Generalist.
[02:10:12.427 --> 02:10:18.470]  And he joins us to tell us about this convoy that I guess means friendship.
[02:10:18.470 --> 02:10:25.494]  The peace drive from Berlin to Moscow is a citizen's initiative to promote international friendship between Germany and Russia.
[02:10:25.494 --> 02:10:29.656]  The Germans and Russians killed about 20 million on each side in World War II.
[02:10:29.656 --> 02:10:30.436]  40 million plus dead.
[02:10:30.436 --> 02:10:31.997]  Yeah, it's a good idea to have another war.
[02:10:33.246 --> 02:10:38.551]  And they are involved in a convoy to draw attention to what's happening.
[02:10:38.551 --> 02:10:43.014]  The website is drushba.info.
[02:10:43.014 --> 02:10:44.796]  We'll get into the meaning of that word.
[02:10:44.796 --> 02:10:49.640]  Max, thanks for joining us.
[02:10:49.640 --> 02:10:50.881]  Again, he is on the border there.
[02:10:50.881 --> 02:10:51.842]  We tried this yesterday.
[02:10:51.842 --> 02:10:54.184]  I think it might be three times the charm.
[02:10:59.230 --> 02:11:01.432]  Let them go through the checkpoint and we'll get them on later.
[02:11:01.432 --> 02:11:04.094]  Twice is the try, but we've plugged it, we've done it.
[02:11:04.094 --> 02:11:09.157]  I'll try it one more time tomorrow and then we'll maybe cover some of their HD videos once they put them out.
[02:11:29.471 --> 02:11:30.152]  We're good to go.
[02:11:49.224 --> 02:11:53.068]  Yeah, this guy's involved in a very large pro-Taliban movement.
[02:11:53.068 --> 02:12:01.216]  He spits out a lot of anti-homosexual rhetoric and stuff like that, where he calls for the cleansing of these kind of people.
[02:12:01.216 --> 02:12:06.862]  And meanwhile, you have a presidential candidate in Hillary Clinton, who gets on stage and says she's for the LGBT.
[02:12:07.703 --> 02:12:10.764]  And she is taking money from Saudi Arabia.
[02:12:10.764 --> 02:12:14.745]  She's taking money from countries that murder them, throw them off buildings.
[02:12:14.745 --> 02:12:22.566]  And now you have this guy, the father of Omar Mateen, who killed over 49 people in Orlando, Florida at the Pulse nightclub.
[02:12:22.566 --> 02:12:26.107]  And this guy is in the vetted area standing behind her.
[02:12:26.107 --> 02:12:28.128]  That should piss off a lot of people.
[02:12:28.128 --> 02:12:32.489]  And it also sends a message to other people out there, hey, you want to go out and shoot some people up?
[02:12:32.489 --> 02:12:33.909]  Come on into the Democratic Party.
[02:12:34.389 --> 02:12:42.713]  Now, the local WPTV news actually stopped and talked to Sadiq and said, asked him a few questions.
[02:12:42.713 --> 02:12:46.354]  He said, I've been cooperating with the federal government and that's about it.
[02:12:46.354 --> 02:12:46.935]  Thank you.
[02:12:46.935 --> 02:12:47.615]  And then he walked out.
[02:12:47.615 --> 02:12:49.776]  By the way, the footage of him behind Hillary is priceless.
[02:12:50.819 --> 02:12:51.539]  From the newscast.
[02:12:51.539 --> 02:12:56.101]  For TV viewers, we can roll some of that behind to just see him smiling behind her.
[02:12:56.101 --> 02:12:57.561]  This does smell like style.
[02:12:57.561 --> 02:12:58.562]  What do you think's going on?
[02:12:58.562 --> 02:12:59.402]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:12:59.402 --> 02:13:01.143]  He says Hillary Clinton is good for the U.S.
[02:13:01.143 --> 02:13:03.644]  versus Donald Trump, who has no solutions.
[02:13:03.644 --> 02:13:09.826]  Now, the news crew ran into her a few miles down the road and was actually able to stop and interview him.
[02:13:10.206 --> 02:13:19.112]  So I don't know what happened in between the time that he didn't want to really give a statement and to the, you know, miles down the road when this crew ran into him again, you know, accidentally at this rest stop.
[02:13:19.112 --> 02:13:23.395]  He then comes out and makes a statement that I think is very interesting.
[02:13:23.395 --> 02:13:26.577]  He says, it's the Democratic Party anyone can join.
[02:13:27.912 --> 02:13:29.173]  That's a statement he's making.
[02:13:29.173 --> 02:13:30.474]  He's looking at all those people.
[02:13:30.474 --> 02:13:31.894]  Hey, you want to come out here?
[02:13:31.894 --> 02:13:32.635]  You want to come out here?
[02:13:32.635 --> 02:13:34.016]  Because my son did this.
[02:13:34.016 --> 02:13:35.477]  My son carried out my wishes.
[02:13:35.477 --> 02:13:36.417]  You guys want to come out here?
[02:13:36.417 --> 02:13:36.777]  Guess what?
[02:13:36.777 --> 02:13:40.720]  The Democratic Party is going to be one that's going to allow you to come into this country.
[02:13:40.720 --> 02:13:43.521]  And the Democratic Party is allowing these borders to be wide open.
[02:13:43.521 --> 02:13:44.622]  That's the message worldwide.
[02:13:44.622 --> 02:13:45.623]  He's conducting a jihad.
[02:13:45.623 --> 02:13:45.803]  Yes!
[02:13:46.403 --> 02:13:52.967]  He's saying to all those people out there, those pro-Taliban supporters, those ISIS sympathizers, hey man, you want to come to America?
[02:13:52.967 --> 02:13:56.689]  Come in, vote Democrat, let's get Hillary Clinton in, we'll be able to have fun.
[02:13:56.689 --> 02:13:59.231]  And then they also want to push this whole gun control thing.
[02:13:59.231 --> 02:14:00.651]  Why would they want to push gun control?
[02:14:00.651 --> 02:14:01.272]  Why?
[02:14:01.272 --> 02:14:03.473]  Because gun-free zones are kill zones.
[02:14:03.473 --> 02:14:09.277]  They take the guns away, then they're psychotic, jihadi- We have a literal, just like Khan, pushes this Muslim
[02:14:10.157 --> 02:14:17.159]  Law firm, Muslim journal, to turn us over to Sharia law and the weird leftist cover for it all.
[02:14:17.159 --> 02:14:17.759]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:14:17.759 --> 02:14:18.899]  He's able to sit here and go, what?
[02:14:18.899 --> 02:14:19.899]  Let's bring these people in.
[02:14:19.899 --> 02:14:20.380]  It's okay.
[02:14:20.380 --> 02:14:21.120]  Let's do this.
[02:14:21.120 --> 02:14:24.921]  But then you want to come out and say, oh, you want to make fun of gold star families or whatever like that.
[02:14:24.921 --> 02:14:29.542]  If you notice the wife didn't say anything, maybe it's because they're actually practicing Sharia law at home.
[02:14:29.542 --> 02:14:33.763]  Maybe Mr. Khan doesn't allow his wife to speak in public unless he speaks to him.
[02:14:33.763 --> 02:14:37.484]  And by the way, we have a clip where Saudi Arabia on record is Hillary's biggest donor.
[02:14:37.484 --> 02:14:37.884]  Here it is.
[02:14:38.715 --> 02:14:42.477]  What is the connection between Hillary Clinton and Saudi Arabia that certainly got Israel angry?
[02:14:42.477 --> 02:14:43.678]  It's extensive.
[02:14:43.678 --> 02:14:50.662]  I mean, the relationships between Hillary Clinton and Saudi Arabia, between the Clinton Foundation and Saudi Arabia.
[02:14:50.662 --> 02:14:59.007]  Saudi Arabia is probably the largest single donor to the Clinton Foundation.
[02:14:59.007 --> 02:15:06.652]  And you can see Clinton's arms export
[02:15:13.257 --> 02:15:15.539]  Saudi Arabia.
[02:15:15.539 --> 02:15:19.622]  Yeah, I mean, she's a communist Chinese agent slash Saudi Arabia agent.
[02:15:19.622 --> 02:15:23.785]  And folks, I criticize Israel when they're doing stuff that's wrong, because, you know, Israel's a complex government.
[02:15:23.785 --> 02:15:25.626]  It's got bad people as well.
[02:15:25.626 --> 02:15:30.750]  But this thing that Israel makes the weather the way it is, and if you fall into the banana peel, Israel did it.
[02:15:30.750 --> 02:15:32.731]  No, I look at what, who really runs it.
[02:15:32.731 --> 02:15:36.714]  And man, I'm telling, and I'll say this, the Israel lobby has really rolled over to communist China.
[02:15:36.714 --> 02:15:38.315]  So, you know, bad on them for that.
[02:15:39.196 --> 02:15:40.617]  It's Saudi Arabia.
[02:15:40.617 --> 02:15:41.478]  It is China.
[02:15:41.478 --> 02:15:44.480]  They've got so much money, they are just pumping it in.
[02:15:44.480 --> 02:15:46.322]  They are doing whatever they want.
[02:15:46.322 --> 02:15:49.224]  And I'm wondering, Joe Biggs, what is the bigger picture here?
[02:15:49.224 --> 02:15:50.365]  Why are they doing this?
[02:15:50.365 --> 02:15:51.366]  Where are they wanting to go?
[02:15:51.366 --> 02:15:55.890]  I mean, the reason they can get away with it is because most people are scared to even go up against the Clintons.
[02:15:56.721 --> 02:16:02.303]  Think about since the DNC, Clinton body counter, left-wing conspiracy, three with ties to DNC have mysteriously died.
[02:16:02.303 --> 02:16:06.065]  That's right, three top DNC people over the delegates dead.
[02:16:06.065 --> 02:16:07.646]  And they're all being found shot in the head.
[02:16:07.646 --> 02:16:15.389]  Since the DNC committee emails were leaked a few weeks ago, three people associated with the DNC have all been found dead under what could be questionable circumstances.
[02:16:15.389 --> 02:16:18.831]  Some including Bernie Sanders supporters suspect that Clintons were behind the deaths.
[02:16:18.831 --> 02:16:23.833]  Now I know people, many of us that were out there, the DNC actually talked to these Sanders supporters.
[02:16:24.113 --> 02:16:26.915]  And they think that the reason that Sanders stood down is because he was threatened.
[02:16:26.915 --> 02:16:27.795]  Well, no kidding.
[02:16:27.795 --> 02:16:38.663]  You look at FBI Director James Comey coming out and all of a sudden listing out all these reasons why she should be indicted, why she should be thrown in jail, and then goes, well, no one's going to take that case, you know.
[02:16:38.663 --> 02:16:41.625]  And then you have this guy right here, Seth Rich, DNC staffer.
[02:16:41.625 --> 02:16:44.447]  Seth Rich was mysteriously murdered in the streets of Washington, D.C.
[02:16:44.447 --> 02:16:45.587]  on July 10th.
[02:16:45.587 --> 02:16:50.030]  Although it was being investigated as a robbery, his wallet, credit cards, and watch were not taken.
[02:16:50.030 --> 02:16:53.573]  The 20-year-old was walking back home from his girlfriend's apartment
[02:16:54.313 --> 02:16:56.354]  And was found shot in the back.
[02:16:56.354 --> 02:17:08.842]  Well, we have the head of the DNC's outreach program, who was over delegates being found dead, and he'd spoken out for Sanders, but... Well, this guy, they believe, is the guy who actually leaked the 20,000 emails to WikiLeaks.
[02:17:08.842 --> 02:17:09.322]  Ah.
[02:17:09.322 --> 02:17:19.128]  They think that this guy, he was an intel analyst, a data analyst, and he was the one responsible, because if you actually go back and look at the video with Julian Assange, he says that he did not get it from any kind of Russian hackers.
[02:17:19.948 --> 02:17:23.809]  Well sure, the Russians have hacked some stuff, but they blame them for everything.
[02:17:23.809 --> 02:17:27.610]  What about conscientious people inside the system that see the corruption?
[02:17:27.610 --> 02:17:32.531]  And Assange has talked about the next group of emails will get Hillary indicted.
[02:17:32.531 --> 02:17:36.191]  Why isn't he releasing them quicker?
[02:17:36.191 --> 02:17:43.533]  Even James Woods has said, what's the line on Vegas for the chances of Julian Assange living until November 8th?
[02:17:44.508 --> 02:17:45.649]  It's not going to look very good.
[02:17:45.649 --> 02:17:51.491]  You know, if this comes out and it's actually as bad as he's saying or as bad as he's building it up, there's something definitely going to happen.
[02:17:51.491 --> 02:17:55.113]  And he's been holed up in that Ecuadorian embassy for how long now?
[02:17:55.113 --> 02:17:57.754]  I mean, it's been years now he's been there.
[02:17:57.754 --> 02:17:58.095]  Exactly.
[02:17:58.095 --> 02:18:00.036]  We have a mysterious DNC desk club.
[02:18:00.036 --> 02:18:00.576]  Let's play that.
[02:18:02.063 --> 02:18:10.426]  And another man connected to the DNC has been found dead less than a month after the murder of DNC staffer Seth Conrad Rich.
[02:18:10.426 --> 02:18:17.928]  One America's Rachel Rubato tells us more about the mysterious death surrounding Sean Lucas and his involvement with the party's email scandal.
[02:18:19.013 --> 02:18:27.460]  It was a celebratory day for Sean Lucas when he entered the DNC building last month and told a committee official, you've been served.
[02:18:27.460 --> 02:18:31.683]  Lucas worked as a process server for the class action DNC lawsuit.
[02:18:31.683 --> 02:18:39.069]  The lawsuit was filed against both the committee and former DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz for allegedly committing acts of fraud.
[02:18:39.069 --> 02:18:42.412]  After leaked emails revealed the DNC showed favoritism towards
[02:18:42.432 --> 02:18:42.852]  Yeah, you're good.
[02:19:07.870 --> 02:19:15.819]  But in a bizarre twist of events on August 2nd, less than one month after serving the subpoena, Lucas was reported dead.
[02:19:15.819 --> 02:19:23.347]  According to police records, Lucas' girlfriend found him lying on the floor unresponsive when she returned home that evening and immediately called 911.
[02:19:24.989 --> 02:19:28.913]  Paramedics said there was no sign of life by the time they arrived on the scene.
[02:19:28.913 --> 02:19:36.360]  Police are not releasing the cause of death at this time and are not commenting on speculation that Lucas was murdered.
[02:19:36.360 --> 02:19:42.146]  His unusual and sudden death is fueling speculation about the recent death of Seth Conrad Rich.
[02:19:42.146 --> 02:19:49.533]  Rich, a DNC employee, was working on several committee cases involving voter and election fraud before he was murdered by gunshots.
[02:19:49.873 --> 02:19:56.036]  He was also set to testify in the FBI's email investigation of Hillary Clinton before he was killed.
[02:19:56.036 --> 02:20:07.441]  Authorities have ruled his death as a robbery gone wrong, but police records indicate nothing was stolen from Rich even though he had a cell phone, cash, and a watch on him at the time of the incident.
[02:20:07.441 --> 02:20:12.703]  No suspects have been arrested and police are now offering a reward to anyone who knows more information.
[02:20:13.513 --> 02:20:14.493]  And now there's been another death.
[02:20:14.493 --> 02:20:16.994]  That's One American News doing a great job.
[02:20:16.994 --> 02:20:18.055]  Joe Biggs?
[02:20:18.055 --> 02:20:22.037]  There's another guy, John Ash, the former president of the United Nations General Assembly.
[02:20:22.037 --> 02:20:26.358]  This is a guy that was found that had died and had a barbell dropped on his head.
[02:20:26.358 --> 02:20:32.001]  But the interesting thing about it, the UN actually released a statement saying that he had died from a heart attack.
[02:20:32.461 --> 02:20:35.262]  And then it came out that they'd found him with his barbell dropped on his head.
[02:20:35.262 --> 02:20:36.983]  He was a 61-year-old man.
[02:20:36.983 --> 02:20:41.244]  He was about to testify against Chinese real estate developer N.G.
[02:20:41.244 --> 02:20:47.306]  Lapsing, who was implicated in the Chinagate scandal for funding money... Oh yeah, the Chinese funding Hillary again.
[02:20:47.306 --> 02:20:48.267]  Oh, he's dead!
[02:20:48.267 --> 02:20:49.527]  Oh!
[02:20:49.527 --> 02:20:51.488]  So, I mean, there's the Clinton body count.
[02:20:51.488 --> 02:20:54.509]  And actually, Darren McBrain, I know he's working on a report for tomorrow.
[02:20:54.509 --> 02:20:56.470]  He's doing a big thing on the body count.
[02:20:56.470 --> 02:20:57.370]  It's building up.
[02:20:57.370 --> 02:21:01.592]  And it's getting to a point where you're starting to see... Now, there's never been dead bodies around the Clintons.
[02:21:03.237 --> 02:21:05.078]  I mean, have you heard about this?
[02:21:05.078 --> 02:21:11.362]  Two of the family members of two of the guys that died in Benghazi have now sued Hillary Clinton for that.
[02:21:11.362 --> 02:21:12.443]  Let's talk about that in a moment.
[02:21:12.443 --> 02:21:17.065]  I'm going to stop right now because I didn't even plug last hour.
[02:21:17.065 --> 02:21:20.768]  We're not going to be here if I don't stop airing the ads.
[02:21:20.768 --> 02:21:21.848]  I'm skipping one right now.
[02:21:21.848 --> 02:21:23.069]  I can't even help it.
[02:21:23.069 --> 02:21:26.731]  So it's kind of like a schizophrenic deal where I just don't even want to have advertising.
[02:21:26.731 --> 02:21:28.232]  I don't want to mess with it, but I've got to have it.
[02:21:30.322 --> 02:21:43.905]  So we go out, we get the very best products we can, at the very lowest prices, things that everybody needs, like water filtration systems, non-GMO seeds, incredible supplements, books, films, Hillary for Prison shirts, Bill Clinton rape shirts.
[02:21:43.905 --> 02:21:47.006]  You want to be aggressive against these criminals' faces, you know, we're doing it.
[02:21:47.006 --> 02:21:50.527]  We have AnthroPlex that is a male and female, but it's advertised to males.
[02:21:51.932 --> 02:21:56.575]  Enhancer for stamina, libido, energy, you name it.
[02:21:56.575 --> 02:21:59.097]  It's got five-star reviews by thousands of folks.
[02:21:59.097 --> 02:22:00.178]  It's like Super Mel Vitality.
[02:22:00.178 --> 02:22:02.539]  It has some different ingredients, but some of the same.
[02:22:02.539 --> 02:22:04.741]  Super Mel is even stronger, but this is less.
[02:22:04.741 --> 02:22:05.862]  But the two go together well.
[02:22:05.862 --> 02:22:07.183]  It's kind of a base for that.
[02:22:07.183 --> 02:22:08.444]  It's 40% off.
[02:22:08.444 --> 02:22:09.504]  We've never done that.
[02:22:09.504 --> 02:22:11.085]  A lot of big specials.
[02:22:11.085 --> 02:22:11.886]  This is our new special.

[02:22:35.848 --> 02:22:36.489]  We're good.
[02:22:55.527 --> 02:22:57.668]  InfowarsStore.com.
[02:22:57.668 --> 02:23:03.851]  And we also have the solar panel control system and the solar panel system itself.
[02:23:03.851 --> 02:23:05.352]  That is 33% off.
[02:23:05.352 --> 02:23:07.653]  We've never offered that.
[02:23:07.653 --> 02:23:09.114]  We have these units in stock.
[02:23:09.114 --> 02:23:15.958]  This is the very best unit, highest rated, best quality, lowest price that we could find in this class.
[02:23:16.658 --> 02:23:20.501]  And a 33% off, it is a loss leader, the InfoWars Solar Base Station Power Supply.
[02:23:20.501 --> 02:23:23.024]  33% off at InfoWarsStore.com.

[02:23:41.124 --> 02:23:42.705]  Then your typical unit.

[02:24:26.751 --> 02:24:29.173]  Your action is what's built InfoWars.
[02:24:29.173 --> 02:24:30.774]  You are InfoWars.
[02:24:30.774 --> 02:24:40.221]  And we're not here like the IRS taking money from you at gunpoint and giving it to MSNBC in a bailout or a stimulus package or $450 million a year to NPR.
[02:24:40.221 --> 02:24:48.888]  We're here just saying we got great products at really great prices and we're crazy enough to go head up against Hillary and the globalists and the communist Chinese and Saudi Arabians.
[02:24:48.888 --> 02:24:51.190]  But look, don't thank me if they do something to us.
[02:24:51.730 --> 02:24:53.432]  I'm not bending over to these people.
[02:24:53.432 --> 02:24:54.854]  I'm never joining them.
[02:24:54.854 --> 02:24:56.936]  I'm not scum.
[02:24:56.936 --> 02:24:57.216]  Okay?
[02:24:57.216 --> 02:25:01.621]  I don't support killing Buddhists and putting them in mobile execution vans and harvesting their organs.
[02:25:01.621 --> 02:25:04.384]  So, people think it's heroic to fight this.
[02:25:04.384 --> 02:25:06.526]  It's insane not to.
[02:25:06.526 --> 02:25:09.109]  Joe Beggs, let's get more into this weirdo shooter.
[02:25:10.345 --> 02:25:15.828]  Father from the Gay Night Club, the Pulse Club in Orlando, showing up at the Stage Hillary event.
[02:25:15.828 --> 02:25:17.670]  He's there in the VIP area.
[02:25:17.670 --> 02:25:19.191]  He gives a press interview.
[02:25:19.191 --> 02:25:20.171]  This is unreal.
[02:25:20.171 --> 02:25:21.152]  What do you think's behind this?
[02:25:21.152 --> 02:25:30.678]  I mean, he is definitely sending out a message, and they're allowing him to send out this message that, hey, if you want to come here, you vote Democrat, you can come here.
[02:25:31.690 --> 02:25:33.511]  Borders are going to be wide open.
[02:25:33.511 --> 02:25:37.794]  And then you have these guys pushing this gun control narrative where they want to have less guns.
[02:25:37.794 --> 02:25:38.795]  Look at California.
[02:25:38.795 --> 02:25:40.176]  Look at Chicago.
[02:25:40.176 --> 02:25:42.017]  Look at Chicago where there's so many people dying.
[02:25:42.017 --> 02:25:50.804]  You're saying the jihad's on, we're going to come here, we're going to kill people, my son's going to kill people, and then we're going to take the slaves' guns.
[02:25:50.804 --> 02:25:52.025]  We're going to take the demies' guns.
[02:25:52.705 --> 02:25:53.165]  Exactly.
[02:25:53.165 --> 02:25:55.327]  I mean, people need to wake up and see.
[02:25:55.327 --> 02:25:56.047]  This is scary.
[02:25:56.047 --> 02:25:57.188]  It's getting to a point.
[02:25:57.188 --> 02:25:57.828]  Now look at this.
[02:25:57.828 --> 02:25:59.909]  Monday, Sadiq posted a video.
[02:25:59.909 --> 02:26:06.333]  Sadiq Mateen says his son was well-educated and respectful to his parents and that he was not aware what motivated him.
[02:26:06.333 --> 02:26:12.097]  Meanwhile, Sadiq has put out many videos saying that homosexuality is bad and these people should be killed.
[02:26:13.194 --> 02:26:18.538]  Then adds, God will punish those... His dad was saying the exact same crap his loon son was doing.
[02:26:18.538 --> 02:26:19.098]  You said it.
[02:26:19.098 --> 02:26:21.780]  It's just like in movies where they say they're sending out codes or whatever.
[02:26:21.780 --> 02:26:22.681]  It's not even coded.
[02:26:22.681 --> 02:26:24.322]  He's there saying, I'm here behind Hillary.
[02:26:24.322 --> 02:26:25.323]  I'm accepted.
[02:26:25.323 --> 02:26:25.843]  Come here.
[02:26:25.843 --> 02:26:26.504]  Do this.
[02:26:26.504 --> 02:26:27.845]  We will take their guns.
[02:26:27.845 --> 02:26:37.551]  My dad sent me a text message earlier saying, hey, go look at Demi contracts from over 11 Islamic countries where Christians and others that were signed a contract to pay 50% tax, not 10%, be slaves.
[02:26:41.997 --> 02:26:43.498]  Excuse me, I'm sorry, really bad allergies right now.
[02:26:43.498 --> 02:26:44.478]  Teleprompter free, folks.
[02:26:44.478 --> 02:26:45.759]  I'm not like Hillary, but I am sneezing.
[02:26:45.759 --> 02:26:50.281]  And I'm like, Dad, you print me the Demi contracts, but you fought this.
[02:26:50.281 --> 02:26:51.601]  Bracken talks about this.
[02:26:51.601 --> 02:26:53.502]  Explain what a Demi contract is.
[02:26:53.502 --> 02:26:54.562]  Well, look at this, though.
[02:26:54.562 --> 02:26:56.683]  With Bo Bergdahl, what do we do with Bo Bergdahl?
[02:26:56.683 --> 02:27:02.086]  We release the Taliban Five, which means we are negotiating with terrorists.
[02:27:02.086 --> 02:27:04.747]  Now we have this money that we have given to Iran.
[02:27:05.865 --> 02:27:07.750]  We're sending out a message in so many ways.
[02:27:07.750 --> 02:27:08.793]  It's alright for you to come here.
[02:27:08.793 --> 02:27:10.598]  It's alright for you to jihad here.
[02:27:10.598 --> 02:27:12.503]  And if you get caught or if something happens, hey!
[02:27:12.503 --> 02:27:14.087]  It's gonna be alright!
[02:27:15.077 --> 02:27:18.659]  We're going to trade our people up for you guys to come here and be comfortable.
[02:27:18.659 --> 02:27:22.922]  That's the big issue, is we're all about making these people feel comfortable here.
[02:27:22.922 --> 02:27:25.723]  Meanwhile, we can't even live in our own country peacefully.
[02:27:25.723 --> 02:27:26.644]  We can't be here happy.
[02:27:26.644 --> 02:27:28.865]  We can't even have our own culture.
[02:27:28.865 --> 02:27:39.151]  There's people within America, women, who can go out and walk around wearing their clothing and be spit on and mocked at by these Muslim men who don't like the way they do it.
[02:27:40.401 --> 02:27:46.985]  But meanwhile, if we go to another country and don't abide by their culture, their rules, we're going to be looked down upon.
[02:27:46.985 --> 02:27:49.727]  But we're told that they can come here and do whatever they want.
[02:27:49.727 --> 02:27:51.268]  It's all going to be free.
[02:27:51.268 --> 02:27:55.451]  Meanwhile, there's veterans who are homeless, who are dying, who are getting the health care they need.
[02:27:55.451 --> 02:28:03.836]  But we're going to bring all these illegals over and allow them to have whatever they want, give them a court date four years down the road, and never see them again.
[02:28:03.836 --> 02:28:06.317]  Look, we're run by foreign enemies, there's no doubt.
[02:28:06.317 --> 02:28:08.499]  DrugsReport.com is top-linked, our story.
[02:28:09.636 --> 02:28:16.703]  When will Hillary disavow Omar Mateen's father, man who supports Taliban and the extermination of gays, shows up at Clinton rally?
[02:28:16.703 --> 02:28:19.906]  And I would just add, Paul, it is put in VIP section.
[02:28:19.906 --> 02:28:20.267]  Yeah.
[02:28:20.267 --> 02:28:21.168]  He's put in VIP section.
[02:28:21.168 --> 02:28:30.737]  When you go to these events, when you get your press pass, your credentials, when you walk into that facility, you will already see those bleachers behind that candidate that will come up and speak already full.
[02:28:30.737 --> 02:28:33.300]  And then the other people will start to funnel in on the outskirts.
[02:28:34.707 --> 02:28:36.828]  And that'll be your rally.
[02:28:36.828 --> 02:28:38.729]  Those people are already pre-picked, pre-determined.
[02:28:38.729 --> 02:28:44.832]  They're usually local Democrats, people who give money to the Hillary Foundation, or Bernie, or whoever that's going to be speaking there.
[02:28:44.832 --> 02:28:49.314]  Those people are given the right to bring them, plus two or three other people, to come in and sit there.
[02:28:49.314 --> 02:28:53.836]  And this guy, sitting here saying, oh I just got an email and the Clinton campaign coming out.
[02:28:53.836 --> 02:28:54.776]  We didn't invite him.
[02:28:54.776 --> 02:28:56.357]  It's complete and total BS.
[02:28:56.357 --> 02:28:57.777]  And listen, they stuck him there.
[02:28:57.777 --> 02:28:58.858]  They tell you where to stand.
[02:28:59.458 --> 02:29:01.239]  Oh yeah, he's stuck in there strategically.
[02:29:20.885 --> 02:29:24.249]  And then we have people like Fatala Gulen that we allow to come in.
[02:29:24.249 --> 02:29:27.152]  The CIA gives a backdoor key to to come in.
[02:29:27.152 --> 02:29:28.513]  He's got 150 million.
[02:29:28.513 --> 02:29:30.615]  I mean, this is what our country's doing.
[02:29:30.615 --> 02:29:33.798]  They're telling these people, hey, Sharia law, that's fine.
[02:29:33.798 --> 02:29:37.302]  Patriotism, Second Amendment, First Amendment, that's bad.
[02:29:37.302 --> 02:29:37.943]  We don't want that here.
[02:29:41.454 --> 02:29:42.395]  I can't believe it anymore.
[02:29:42.395 --> 02:29:42.715]  Stay there.
[02:29:42.715 --> 02:29:45.296]  We're going to be right back and take some phone calls with Joe Biggs.
[02:29:45.296 --> 02:29:46.937]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[02:29:46.937 --> 02:29:48.138]  Please don't take the show for granted.
[02:29:48.138 --> 02:29:49.339]  We're under attack.
[02:29:49.339 --> 02:29:50.720]  We're on the march.
[02:29:50.720 --> 02:29:52.321]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.321 --> 02:29:55.943]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.012 --> 02:30:02.213]  Joe Bates here with InfoWars.com.
[02:30:02.213 --> 02:30:04.694]  Communist Party unites behind Hillary.
[02:30:04.694 --> 02:30:11.816]  The Communist Party USA may not control many actual votes, but what they lack in support is made up for in enthusiasm.
[02:30:11.816 --> 02:30:18.418]  That passion was in full display with a seven-person team of reporters covering their National Political Convention last month.
[02:30:18.418 --> 02:30:25.581]  And their convention was a Democratic National Convention that nominated Hillary Clinton as their undisputed candidate for president.
[02:30:25.581 --> 02:30:29.322]  Here are some examples from the editorial produced as part of that coverage
[02:30:29.542 --> 02:30:30.182]  By the team.
[02:30:59.882 --> 02:31:04.047]  Introducing Vitamin Mineral Fusion from Infowarslife.com.
[02:31:04.047 --> 02:31:11.514]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable grape-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[02:31:11.514 --> 02:31:22.525]  The all-new Vitamin Mineral Fusion drink mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[02:31:22.965 --> 02:31:30.788]  In the history of InfoWars life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.
[02:31:30.788 --> 02:31:34.669]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today.
[02:31:34.669 --> 02:31:44.853]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[02:31:44.853 --> 02:31:51.595]  The ingredients in Vitamin Mineral Fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[02:31:51.935 --> 02:31:53.396]  That means it's clean.
[02:31:53.396 --> 02:31:54.556]  That means it's pure.
[02:31:54.556 --> 02:31:57.458]  That's Infowarslife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:31:57.458 --> 02:31:59.719]  Take action now before we sell out.
[02:31:59.719 --> 02:32:01.339]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[02:32:01.339 --> 02:32:02.840]  You can't survive without it.
[02:32:02.840 --> 02:32:04.020]  But where do you get it?
[02:32:04.020 --> 02:32:09.763]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[02:32:10.023 --> 02:32:15.925]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[02:32:15.925 --> 02:32:32.789]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[02:32:33.189 --> 02:32:35.670]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[02:32:35.670 --> 02:32:37.130]  Stainless steel construction.
[02:32:37.130 --> 02:32:38.171]  Easy assembly.
[02:32:38.171 --> 02:32:39.091]  Low maintenance.
[02:32:39.091 --> 02:32:41.191]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[02:32:53.655 --> 02:32:56.236]  Go to InfowarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:33:10.513 --> 02:33:11.694]  You found it.
[02:33:11.694 --> 02:33:14.737]  The front lines of the human awakening.
[02:33:14.737 --> 02:33:16.839]  It's the end for war.
[02:33:16.839 --> 02:33:19.422]  And now, Alex Jones.
[02:33:19.422 --> 02:33:22.165]  Okay, so, I know about Demi's.
[02:33:33.756 --> 02:33:39.879]  I read about it in history books decades ago, but then we had former Navy SEAL and writer Matt Bracken on about the whole Islamic invasion.
[02:33:39.879 --> 02:33:48.582]  He says, listen, when they let people kill folks in Europe, and politicians say it's not Islamic, that is the cue that they're operating as a good Demi.
[02:33:48.582 --> 02:33:55.765]  Then I go look at Hollande and Merkel and all of them, and Hillary, they're getting hundreds of millions of their foundations and groups and clubs.
[02:33:56.545 --> 02:33:58.986]  And the thing is, these Muslim countries, almost everybody's slaves.
[02:33:58.986 --> 02:34:06.888]  There's these rich elites on top, and they're all about buying influence, taking over governments, and we're just totally laissez-faire and open.
[02:34:06.888 --> 02:34:09.049]  It's like we have no immune system.
[02:34:09.049 --> 02:34:17.391]  So my dad, who's the biggest, you know, history buff, he goes, uh, shimmy means protected in Arabic, dhimmi, pronounced dimmy.
[02:34:20.393 --> 02:34:28.515]  And it goes, as is you are legal to exist, but because you are buying a license to exist, you can pay over and over to be abused.
[02:34:28.515 --> 02:34:30.776]  Look up the modern Demi Contracts.
[02:34:30.776 --> 02:34:32.317]  Well, Dad, just bring them over here.
[02:34:32.317 --> 02:34:38.338]  If you're, okay, yes, I know about Demi Contracts in Arabic from the Middle East and other areas.
[02:34:38.338 --> 02:34:43.260]  It's like when they bring in workers into Indonesia or some area that's Islamic, they tell them, look, you're going to pay higher taxes because you're not a Muslim.
[02:34:44.312 --> 02:34:51.379]  And so it is, and again the first wave is all like friendly, oh I'm here to be your friend, oh I love you, oh.
[02:34:51.379 --> 02:34:54.522]  And maybe they are the heretics, maybe they are the folks that wanted to get away from it.
[02:34:54.522 --> 02:35:04.472]  But then now we're getting the new waves where they admittedly go to people's houses in France and say, you're going to give me a job, my family mayor, or I'm going to kill you.
[02:35:04.472 --> 02:35:07.035]  And the mayors capitulate because it's politically incorrect.
[02:35:08.311 --> 02:35:12.513]  And because the Muslims don't care if you arrest that group, their cousins will come kill you.
[02:35:12.513 --> 02:35:15.875]  And so now this new wave is from the very worst countries.
[02:35:15.875 --> 02:35:22.979]  These are the ones that invaded Syria from all over the Muslim world, got their butts kicked, so now Europe said, just come here, sweetie pies.
[02:35:22.979 --> 02:35:27.062]  I don't see how the leftists are going to get away with this, Joe Biggs.
[02:35:27.062 --> 02:35:32.465]  What the leftists don't understand is the people that they want to bring in are the ones that are going to have a knife to their neck.
[02:35:34.087 --> 02:35:39.034]  They want to bring these kind of people in, but these are the exact same people that are going to go after them first.
[02:35:39.034 --> 02:35:39.294]  Why?
[02:35:39.294 --> 02:35:42.358]  Because they're the weaker of the humans.
[02:35:42.358 --> 02:35:42.879]  Exactly.
[02:35:42.879 --> 02:35:46.364]  Why do the jihadis continue to attack mainly their own democrat people?
[02:35:46.364 --> 02:35:47.966]  Because they have no respect for them?
[02:35:47.966 --> 02:35:49.148]  They're lesser.
[02:35:50.089 --> 02:35:57.577]  I mean, look at how men, when I grew up, and the heroes we had that we looked up to, you know, the John Waynes and, you know, all this stuff.
[02:35:57.577 --> 02:36:01.222]  We had all these people that we looked up to and we're like, man, that's what a man should be.
[02:36:01.222 --> 02:36:06.267]  Someone who fights for his family, fights for his land, fights for his country, and doesn't back down.
[02:36:07.438 --> 02:36:09.059]  We don't have those kind of people anymore.
[02:36:09.059 --> 02:36:13.784]  We have no role models now because these men have been dumbed down so much.
[02:36:13.784 --> 02:36:16.246]  They're so nancified, so pussified.
[02:36:16.246 --> 02:36:16.826]  They are weak.
[02:36:16.826 --> 02:36:23.172]  They wear short shorts and, you know, they look like you can't tell the difference between a guy and a girl half the time.
[02:36:23.172 --> 02:36:26.835]  And these guys coming over there, they grow up in war-torn countries.
[02:36:26.835 --> 02:36:29.598]  They're fighting every day for something they believe in.
[02:36:29.598 --> 02:36:32.360]  They truly believe in and they're willing to die for.
[02:36:32.360 --> 02:36:34.262]  They're willing to strap a bomb to their chest.
[02:36:35.359 --> 02:36:39.083]  And blow themselves up and kill whoever for what they believe in.
[02:36:39.083 --> 02:36:44.848]  And they see the people over here in Europe, they see the people here in America, and they go, wow, these people are weak!
[02:36:44.848 --> 02:36:45.348]  So that's it.
[02:36:45.348 --> 02:36:46.209]  We just take them.
[02:36:46.209 --> 02:36:47.831]  The left hates the open freedom.
[02:36:48.956 --> 02:36:53.502]  They hate the true liberalism that their fathers and mothers and forebears gave them.
[02:36:53.502 --> 02:36:58.408]  And so it's just like women that like abusive men or bad boys.
[02:36:58.408 --> 02:37:00.131]  It is Stockholm Syndrome.
[02:37:00.131 --> 02:37:00.932]  And they're cuckold.
[02:37:00.932 --> 02:37:05.958]  They really are dominated and think it's sexy and want to wear a burka and be in a slave pit.
[02:37:06.559 --> 02:37:12.203]  I mean, they really want to be sold at bazaars in North Africa at a subconscious level.
[02:37:12.203 --> 02:37:13.524]  They hate daddy.
[02:37:13.524 --> 02:37:19.249]  They gave him all this freedom and they just want to crap all over the West and mutilate and bring everything down.
[02:37:19.249 --> 02:37:21.150]  I grew up in the woods.
[02:37:21.150 --> 02:37:24.113]  I grew up with camel on my face and deer urine on me.
[02:37:24.873 --> 02:37:30.358]  In a tree stand, shooting a bow, taking out a deer, fishing, going out, building stuff.
[02:37:30.358 --> 02:37:31.980]  I mean, that's what I grew up doing.
[02:37:31.980 --> 02:37:33.502]  You didn't play Pokemon Go?
[02:37:33.502 --> 02:37:34.422]  No!
[02:37:34.422 --> 02:37:35.704]  My Pokemon were deer!
[02:37:35.704 --> 02:37:37.505]  And hogs!
[02:37:37.505 --> 02:37:39.567]  I'd round those things up and throw them in a bag and eat them!
[02:37:40.468 --> 02:37:41.089]  I heard it in person.
[02:37:41.089 --> 02:37:49.201]  But think about this, when you go talk about hunting now, when I go out in public here in Austin, around the country, and I talk about hunting, people go, ooh, that's disgusting.
[02:37:49.201 --> 02:37:55.710]  And then you just throw it away, and I'm like, no, I clean it right there on the spot, I fillet it, I freeze it, take it home, I eat it.
[02:37:56.718 --> 02:37:59.099]  I provide for my family from the earth.
[02:37:59.099 --> 02:38:02.401]  And you have these men now that are just like, oh, that is so disgusting.
[02:38:02.401 --> 02:38:05.002]  Either way, we're going to see a One Direction concert later.
[02:38:05.002 --> 02:38:06.083]  Like, what the hell is that?
[02:38:06.083 --> 02:38:07.083]  What is One Direction?
[02:38:07.083 --> 02:38:11.906]  The only direction you're moving in towards is being feminine as hell.
[02:38:11.906 --> 02:38:13.266]  Well, and people call it feminine.
[02:38:13.266 --> 02:38:14.367]  I wouldn't even call it that.
[02:38:14.367 --> 02:38:16.688]  It's just they're so disconnected.
[02:38:16.688 --> 02:38:17.488]  I'm not knocking people.
[02:38:17.488 --> 02:38:19.129]  This is the way the world works now.
[02:38:19.129 --> 02:38:20.550]  They broke up the family.
[02:38:20.550 --> 02:38:22.451]  So your family is the trendy group you're in.
[02:38:22.451 --> 02:38:24.572]  Well, that's some artificially programmed system.
[02:38:26.041 --> 02:38:31.426]  I don't know, I just think the death of the American man is starting to happen.
[02:38:31.426 --> 02:38:33.387]  Well, I think it's the death of responsibility.
[02:38:33.387 --> 02:38:39.713]  Because I don't want to romanticize everything in the past either, but if you look at what they are, they just want to run the white flag up and bend over.
[02:38:39.713 --> 02:38:40.894]  Yeah, they're weak.
[02:38:41.474 --> 02:38:45.077]  You don't see many people that are willing to jump up and put something on the line.
[02:38:45.077 --> 02:38:48.020]  It's like these jihadis, they're willing to strap a bomb to their chest.
[02:38:48.020 --> 02:38:54.365]  They're willing to load a two-ton vehicle down with explosives and drive it into a building because they believe in it.
[02:38:54.365 --> 02:38:59.129]  We have no more, we hardly have any Americans that have conviction to really stand up.
[02:38:59.509 --> 02:39:08.377]  And that's why when you see people like Snowden or Assange, people who actually believe in something are uncovering these truths and leaking this information to the public to expose these people.
[02:39:08.377 --> 02:39:10.059]  They're putting their lives on the line.
[02:39:10.059 --> 02:39:12.341]  We are putting our lives on the line.
[02:39:12.341 --> 02:39:14.323]  Not many people are willing to do that anymore.
[02:39:14.323 --> 02:39:17.546]  Well, I'll just throw this out there as a one-liner, but it's true.
[02:39:17.546 --> 02:39:19.708]  People better not take InfoWars for granted.
[02:39:19.708 --> 02:39:21.550]  I don't mean that like, oh, you better appreciate us.
[02:39:21.550 --> 02:39:24.672]  We're fighting every day just to stay on air and to get the information out.
[02:39:25.598 --> 02:39:27.298]  They're bringing in censorship.
[02:39:27.298 --> 02:39:29.259]  It's intensifying by the moment.
[02:39:29.259 --> 02:39:32.340]  And people say, oh, well, once they shut down the press, I'll be OK.
[02:39:32.340 --> 02:39:33.960]  No, they're coming for everybody.
[02:39:33.960 --> 02:39:36.561]  They want to end prosperity because they can't compete with it.
[02:39:36.561 --> 02:39:38.662]  They want to sew this country up.
[02:39:38.662 --> 02:39:45.124]  The enemy is probing us right now by Sadiq Mateen standing there behind a presidential frontrunner.
[02:39:45.124 --> 02:39:46.104]  He is probing.
[02:39:46.104 --> 02:39:47.244]  He is sending a message out there.
[02:39:47.244 --> 02:39:49.805]  He was brought here by the CIA from the Taliban.
[02:39:49.805 --> 02:39:51.165]  I'm OK to be here.
[02:39:51.165 --> 02:39:52.506]  So continue to come on.
[02:39:52.506 --> 02:39:53.246]  You guys are safe.
[02:39:53.846 --> 02:40:00.032]  He's like, I'm at Orlando where my son, who followed the ideology I pushed, kill the gays, did this.
[02:40:00.032 --> 02:40:01.233]  And I'm standing behind Hillary Clinton.
[02:40:01.233 --> 02:40:02.554]  I'm standing behind her.
[02:40:02.554 --> 02:40:04.195]  And there's nothing these Americans will do.
[02:40:04.195 --> 02:40:05.176]  We've conquered them.
[02:40:05.176 --> 02:40:06.177]  I'm planting the flag.
[02:40:06.177 --> 02:40:08.299]  You don't know how pathetic they are.
[02:40:08.299 --> 02:40:16.827]  And they know that these leftists are going to sit back and go, oh my God, we can't say anything because if we, you know, if we would have brought it up, then we could have been looked at as racist.
[02:40:16.827 --> 02:40:19.810]  And meanwhile, this guy comes up behind him with a blade and just cuts their head off.
[02:40:20.410 --> 02:40:26.618]  But they're willing to sit here and die for political correctness, but they're not willing to die for what America stands for.
[02:40:26.618 --> 02:40:35.329]  Because they created a thought system to base their whole world on rationalizing their cowardice.
[02:40:35.329 --> 02:40:39.073]  I know there's a lot of men and women out there who are willing to stand up and fight for stuff.
[02:40:39.827 --> 02:40:42.828]  The problem is, though, the way they've compartmentalized everything, how do you do it?
[02:40:42.828 --> 02:40:51.770]  Well, you do it with information warfare, you do it with the truth, and you do it with you being the eyes and ears out there, like listeners did, to show that no one was there to see Hillary, but the media lied about it.
[02:40:51.770 --> 02:40:54.711]  You were the human intelligence on the ground that exposed that.
[02:40:54.711 --> 02:40:55.211]  Put that out.
[02:40:55.211 --> 02:40:56.372]  Now it's at the top of DrudgeReport.com.
[02:40:56.372 --> 02:40:58.912]  In fact, let's go to DrudgeReport.com right now.
[02:40:58.912 --> 02:41:01.113]  Paul Watson's article is up there on the very, very top.
[02:41:02.456 --> 02:41:09.143]  Dealing with when will Mr. Mateen decry what his son did?
[02:41:09.143 --> 02:41:11.305]  And when will Hillary disavow?
[02:41:11.305 --> 02:41:13.867]  When will Hillary disavow?
[02:41:13.867 --> 02:41:16.270]  Will Hillary disavow Mateen endorsement?
[02:41:16.270 --> 02:41:17.271]  Let's click on that.
[02:41:17.271 --> 02:41:18.592]  That's the big question.
[02:41:18.592 --> 02:41:19.833]  The Mateen endorsement.
[02:41:19.833 --> 02:41:20.273]  Hashtag.
[02:41:20.854 --> 02:41:23.395]  We have that hashtag, you know, saying, will she disavow?
[02:41:23.395 --> 02:41:24.156]  But think about this.
[02:41:24.156 --> 02:41:30.639]  If this was Donald Trump at a rally right now in Kissimmee, Florida, and we would have spotted Sadiq Mateen in the background, what would have happened?
[02:41:30.639 --> 02:41:32.339]  That would have been... He was clearly brought in.
[02:41:32.339 --> 02:41:33.880]  He was clearly vetted.
[02:41:33.880 --> 02:41:34.800]  He was placed behind.
[02:41:34.800 --> 02:41:36.861]  What messages is Trump sending?
[02:41:36.861 --> 02:41:37.882]  How insensitive he is.
[02:41:37.882 --> 02:41:46.586]  In the very town where the families lost 50-something people, and there's the father himself with his homophobic YouTube channel, an international TV program, calling, you know, for
[02:41:47.066 --> 02:41:52.729]  You know, the eradication of these people, and then there he is gloating on top of the tombstones of the dead people.
[02:41:52.729 --> 02:41:54.530]  This is the end of Donald Trump!
[02:41:54.530 --> 02:41:55.670]  Exactly.
[02:41:55.670 --> 02:42:00.993]  They would say his racist bigotry is what led to this, and this further shows that having... The insensitivity.
[02:42:00.993 --> 02:42:12.919]  ...in the background, that he has no sensitivity for the deaths of the homosexuals who died at the Pulse nightclub, and he's sending a message that it's okay to have this kind of bigotry towards people who are different than us.
[02:42:12.919 --> 02:42:14.160]  This is pissing on the graves.
[02:42:14.440 --> 02:42:15.340]  Yes it is!
[02:42:15.340 --> 02:42:18.242]  And she is openly allowing him to do this on it.
[02:42:18.242 --> 02:42:32.347]  They stuck him, because I've read about this, you've been there many times, but they admit going back decades, that these presidential things, and who they put behind his key in the demographic, who they place, and they put him right over her right shoulder.
[02:42:32.347 --> 02:42:37.790]  I mean, he is right there where you see his head the whole time!
[02:42:38.610 --> 02:42:41.071]  This guy that was on every TV station for a month.
[02:42:41.071 --> 02:42:42.111]  Well, go back to the picture.
[02:42:42.111 --> 02:42:47.073]  He's actually wearing a red hat that looks like a Trump hat.
[02:42:47.073 --> 02:42:48.793]  But it's not that red hat though.
[02:42:48.793 --> 02:42:51.694]  It almost looks like that's kind of purposely like... It's all subliminal.
[02:42:51.694 --> 02:42:53.635]  I mean, let's go back and show it.
[02:42:53.635 --> 02:42:54.895]  You know, I agree with you.
[02:42:54.895 --> 02:42:56.216]  I totally agree with you.
[02:42:56.216 --> 02:42:56.936]  This is sick, Joe.
[02:42:59.230 --> 02:43:00.591]  People are going to see that red hat.
[02:43:00.591 --> 02:43:09.558]  Some people who aren't going to get the actual correct coverage of what's going on, they're going to see him in the back with that red hat and they're going to be like, oh my god, he was back there with his red hat.
[02:43:09.558 --> 02:43:10.859]  It's much like Trump's hat.
[02:43:10.859 --> 02:43:12.220]  Trump who's a racist and a bigot.
[02:43:12.220 --> 02:43:14.281]  He'll probably spend it and say, endorse Trump.
[02:43:14.281 --> 02:43:14.942]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:43:14.942 --> 02:43:16.062]  That's how Hillary will respond.
[02:43:16.903 --> 02:43:19.204]  I want to take a few phone calls in the time we've got left.
[02:43:19.204 --> 02:43:21.486]  Let me give the number out.
[02:43:21.486 --> 02:43:22.366]  It's 800-259-9231.
[02:43:22.366 --> 02:43:23.687]  The David Knight's coming in to take over.
[02:43:23.687 --> 02:43:25.068]  800-259-9231.
[02:43:25.068 --> 02:43:27.769]  What do you think he's doing?
[02:43:27.769 --> 02:43:31.291]  Showing up in the tiny VIP section right behind her.
[02:43:31.291 --> 02:43:32.232]  Here's what's scary.
[02:43:32.232 --> 02:43:33.973]  More people in the VIP section.
[02:43:34.853 --> 02:43:37.714]  That's all vetted and scripted than there were at the Sear.
[02:43:37.714 --> 02:43:39.095]  That's the even bigger story.
[02:43:39.095 --> 02:43:45.257]  It's like fraud on top of fraud, on top of fraud, with this doddering lady up there.
[02:43:45.257 --> 02:43:46.998]  This is what Matt Drebs calls a violence zone.
[02:43:46.998 --> 02:43:55.321]  How many people were in that stadium, or that little hall or whatever you want to call it, that actually had friends or family who died in that shooting?
[02:43:56.161 --> 02:43:58.023]  And no one said anything to this man?
[02:43:58.023 --> 02:43:58.964]  He should have been mauled!
[02:43:58.964 --> 02:44:00.906]  People should have been going up like, why are you here?
[02:44:00.906 --> 02:44:05.250]  Like, why do you think it's even okay for you to be here, based off the rhetoric you've been spewing for so long?
[02:44:05.250 --> 02:44:09.534]  I'm surprised they went, I know it's your culture to kill gays, so thank you for carrying out your culture.
[02:44:09.534 --> 02:44:12.638]  Sorry about the bigots that, like, tried to block their faces when you shot them.
[02:44:12.638 --> 02:44:13.358]  But think about that.
[02:44:13.358 --> 02:44:17.162]  I think they should be tied up on telephone poles so you can shoot them slower.
[02:44:17.162 --> 02:44:19.584]  Or maybe use a Saudi Arabian saber on their wee-wees.
[02:44:20.421 --> 02:44:22.723]  Yeah, Trump supporters would have called that guy out in a second.
[02:44:22.723 --> 02:44:23.985]  Like, what the hell are you doing here?
[02:44:23.985 --> 02:44:26.067]  He would have gotten his ass kicked.
[02:44:26.067 --> 02:44:26.948]  Yeah, within seconds.
[02:44:26.948 --> 02:44:28.810]  Because he didn't come there to apologize.
[02:44:28.810 --> 02:44:30.672]  No, he came there to gloat.
[02:44:30.672 --> 02:44:32.234]  Like, look, I'm still here.
[02:44:32.234 --> 02:44:35.617]  You want to know why?
[02:44:35.617 --> 02:44:38.720]  Aloha snack bar.
[02:44:38.720 --> 02:44:39.501]  He was gloating.
[02:44:40.356 --> 02:44:41.756]  He's going, hey, I'm still here.
[02:44:41.756 --> 02:44:44.317]  My rhetoric is what caused my son to go out and do it.
[02:44:44.317 --> 02:44:44.977]  Well, it's true.
[02:44:44.977 --> 02:44:46.918]  They've taken our life force away.
[02:44:46.918 --> 02:44:51.519]  They've taken our will to survive, to have kids, to live in the West, no matter what color we are.
[02:44:51.519 --> 02:44:54.340]  And they've just brought in, like, cavemen that are just ready to take over.
[02:44:54.340 --> 02:44:59.201]  All their emails are, you're webbing our eyes, you're a weak, we will take the web and kill the men.
[02:44:59.201 --> 02:45:00.602]  What are our kids doing?
[02:45:00.602 --> 02:45:02.282]  Oh, yes, kill us.
[02:45:02.282 --> 02:45:02.722]  Oh!
[02:45:02.722 --> 02:45:04.223]  It's like aged Skrillex.
[02:45:04.223 --> 02:45:05.003]  What are our kids doing?
[02:45:05.003 --> 02:45:07.984]  They're running around with a cell phone in their face, trying to... I hate the West!
[02:45:08.797 --> 02:45:10.339]  You know what their kids are doing right now?
[02:45:10.339 --> 02:45:11.581]  Learning how to shoot.
[02:45:11.581 --> 02:45:14.044]  Learning how to survive on a small bag of rice.
[02:45:14.044 --> 02:45:17.889]  Learning how to build stuff.
[02:45:17.889 --> 02:45:20.873]  That's the thing though, there's an actual war going on.
[02:45:20.873 --> 02:45:22.716]  And we're not getting prepared at all.
[02:45:22.716 --> 02:45:23.197]  Overall.
[02:45:23.197 --> 02:45:23.837]  Why are you being racist?
[02:45:24.946 --> 02:45:25.787]  Hey, I've been there.
[02:45:25.787 --> 02:45:27.088]  I know what these people do.
[02:45:27.088 --> 02:45:28.269]  I know what goes on.
[02:45:28.269 --> 02:45:32.474]  I've seen kids coming out of bazaars throwing grenades at Humvees.
[02:45:32.474 --> 02:45:34.096]  These aren't normal kids.
[02:45:34.096 --> 02:45:37.239]  Our kids are throwing balls trying to pick up Pokeyman Go.
[02:45:37.239 --> 02:45:38.140]  They're throwing grenades.
[02:45:38.140 --> 02:45:40.542]  They're learning how to fashion together knives.
[02:45:42.731 --> 02:45:45.953]  To go after the non-radical country to bring it down, the enemy of Saudi Arabia.
[02:45:45.953 --> 02:45:47.574]  See how crazy that is?
[02:45:47.574 --> 02:45:49.596]  To then take Iraq over for the jihadists.
[02:45:49.596 --> 02:45:53.619]  I'm not blaming you guys, but see the larger... See how sick that is?
[02:45:53.619 --> 02:45:58.102]  Our military thought they were fighting radical Islam when it was basically laying the path in for it.
[02:45:58.703 --> 02:45:58.843]  Yeah.
[02:45:58.843 --> 02:46:01.366]  I mean, you gotta think... Disagree with me if you disagree with that statement.
[02:46:01.366 --> 02:46:01.606]  No, no, no.
[02:46:01.606 --> 02:46:04.709]  I believe you, but you gotta think the low guy on the totem pole... No, I'm not blaming him.
[02:46:04.709 --> 02:46:05.529]  They don't know.
[02:46:05.529 --> 02:46:11.015]  Yeah, we have... No, I'm not... I'm saying though... We're given intel and we go, well, I guess that's what it is.
[02:46:11.015 --> 02:46:14.558]  No, no, but I'm saying the good news is our military said no about the Syria deal.
[02:46:14.558 --> 02:46:15.299]  They've got it.
[02:46:15.299 --> 02:46:19.603]  So how does Obama and Hillary and the globalists put the genie back in the bottle now that the military gets the scam?
[02:46:21.664 --> 02:46:26.711]  Well they continue to put these reporters out that are leftist-leaning kind of people.
[02:46:26.711 --> 02:46:29.274]  So many people watch TV and get their information from that.
[02:46:29.274 --> 02:46:36.223]  They're controlling the narrative by having these kind of people like Anderson Cooper putting out all the information to the bulk of the people.
[02:46:36.664 --> 02:46:37.245]  That's how they do it.
[02:46:37.245 --> 02:46:38.566]  They control the narrative.
[02:46:38.566 --> 02:46:45.252]  Meanwhile, if you're an awake soldier, a veteran, whatever, it really doesn't matter because they're pushing all their stuff to the bulk people.
[02:46:45.252 --> 02:46:53.920]  And when you go out and you bring up the fact that there's radical Islam being brought into our country, the fact that the borders are wide open, they're all going to look at you and laugh and go, haha.
[02:46:53.920 --> 02:46:54.741]  Rachel Maddow.
[02:46:54.741 --> 02:46:55.341]  Look at 9-11.
[02:46:55.341 --> 02:46:58.764]  If the event happens, the Wahhabist enemies get attacked.
[02:46:58.764 --> 02:46:58.965]  Iraq.
[02:46:59.605 --> 02:47:03.327]  Same thing now, the deal is bring them in, let them attack, take our rights when they attack.
[02:47:03.327 --> 02:47:08.590]  There is a deal with Islam, with Wahhabism, to take this country down.
[02:47:08.590 --> 02:47:09.651]  I 100% believe that.
[02:47:09.651 --> 02:47:15.694]  I remember hearing the FBI like 15 years ago, like, it's like, Al Qaeda knows what we're going to do before we do it.
[02:47:15.694 --> 02:47:17.715]  It's like they have moles above us.
[02:47:17.715 --> 02:47:22.178]  Well yeah, it turns out that is what was happening.
[02:47:22.178 --> 02:47:23.298]  Well, let's go to a few phone calls.
[02:47:23.298 --> 02:47:25.099]  Joe Biggs is our guest.
[02:47:25.099 --> 02:47:27.100]  Let me just add real quickly that we have 40% off the
[02:47:29.480 --> 02:47:38.626]  Exercise, libido, stamina enhancer, the best organic formula we could come up with, the highest quality, super low price already, 40% off AnthroPlex.
[02:47:38.626 --> 02:47:41.588]  That's our new special we're running right now on InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:47:41.588 --> 02:47:42.569]  Women can take it as well.
[02:47:42.569 --> 02:47:43.790]  Check it out, read about it.
[02:47:43.790 --> 02:47:46.111]  Look at the 4.8 star reviews.
[02:47:46.111 --> 02:47:51.215]  InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, and a lot of other specials as well.
[02:47:51.215 --> 02:47:54.397]  Let's go to, who should we go to first here?
[02:47:54.397 --> 02:47:56.418]  Let's go to Charles in Tennessee.
[02:47:56.418 --> 02:47:57.379]  You're on the air, welcome.
[02:47:58.769 --> 02:47:59.969]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[02:47:59.969 --> 02:48:01.570]  It's a pleasure to speak with you both.
[02:48:01.570 --> 02:48:07.671]  I just really wanted to take the opportunity to call in and say thank you for the work that you're doing.
[02:48:07.671 --> 02:48:10.012]  Give a shout out to Sergeant Joe Biggs there.
[02:48:10.012 --> 02:48:15.353]  I've never had the pleasure of actually getting to call and speak with you, Aerosol.
[02:48:15.353 --> 02:48:19.014]  And, you know, certainly appreciate your service, sir.
[02:48:19.014 --> 02:48:24.675]  I was, you know, fortunate enough to be able to serve my country as well.
[02:48:24.675 --> 02:48:25.375]  Alex, I just
[02:48:25.762 --> 02:48:28.144]  I just really want to say thank you for everything you do.
[02:48:28.144 --> 02:48:28.984]  God bless you all.
[02:48:28.984 --> 02:48:29.625]  God bless America.
[02:48:29.625 --> 02:48:33.288]  Well, please don't thank me because I'm going to say this, and I had a pet peeve on this.
[02:48:33.288 --> 02:48:38.231]  You guys are more important than we are, giving us the information on the ground, supporting us, spreading the word.
[02:48:38.231 --> 02:48:39.832]  You're just as important as we are.
[02:48:39.832 --> 02:48:41.874]  We're all in this with you too, brother.
[02:48:41.874 --> 02:48:47.198]  How do we get the word out to the public that's somewhat awake but not fully awake?
[02:48:47.198 --> 02:48:51.441]  You know, sir, I've continued to try to do what I can
[02:48:52.378 --> 02:48:52.578]  Yes.
[02:48:52.578 --> 02:48:52.658]  Yes.
[02:49:12.893 --> 02:49:17.717]  Even if it's just we all have a website where we can go in and say, hey, I voted for such and such.
[02:49:17.717 --> 02:49:21.220]  I want to go on record that says I voted for so and so.
[02:49:21.220 --> 02:49:22.201]  Prove me wrong.
[02:49:22.201 --> 02:49:22.501]  I agree.
[02:49:22.501 --> 02:49:25.224]  Everybody should go out and do exit polls to just show.
[02:49:25.224 --> 02:49:26.885]  I talked to 100 people.
[02:49:26.885 --> 02:49:27.826]  70% were for Trump.
[02:49:27.826 --> 02:49:28.887]  They're showing different.
[02:49:28.887 --> 02:49:30.408]  That's how we're going to burn them.
[02:49:30.408 --> 02:49:31.569]  That's how we're going to resist them.
[02:49:31.569 --> 02:49:32.370]  And separately.
[02:49:33.050 --> 02:49:40.874]  Everybody should be copying stories off InfoWars, Prison Planet, and other important sites so that they take us down, you can put it back up.
[02:49:40.874 --> 02:49:43.236]  Because believe me folks, it is getting bad.
[02:49:43.236 --> 02:49:43.996]  It is.
[02:49:43.996 --> 02:49:45.997]  They are really trying to shut things down right now.
[02:49:45.997 --> 02:49:50.020]  Look, the coup over Fox three weeks ago, they suddenly, you watch it,
[02:49:50.860 --> 02:49:51.421]  It is.
[02:49:51.421 --> 02:49:52.581]  It is, except for Hannity.
[02:49:52.581 --> 02:49:54.002]  They have taken that channel over.
[02:49:54.002 --> 02:49:56.484]  Yeah, Hannity's the last true guy out there, really.
[02:49:56.484 --> 02:49:57.065]  He's not perfect.
[02:49:57.065 --> 02:49:57.705]  In the mainstream.
[02:49:57.705 --> 02:49:59.867]  But the point is, they're trying to shut him down right now.
[02:49:59.867 --> 02:50:01.908]  I mean, Fox is gone, folks.
[02:50:01.908 --> 02:50:03.209]  It is gone.
[02:50:03.209 --> 02:50:05.050]  I mean, that shows you they are moving in.
[02:50:05.050 --> 02:50:09.634]  But why aren't Americans pissed off at the fact that illegals can come into this country and vote?
[02:50:10.711 --> 02:50:15.872]  Without registering, without doing anything, and be allowed to go do that and have their vote count multiple times.
[02:50:15.872 --> 02:50:22.333]  But me, I can't even go to Topgolf in North Austin without registering to get a Topgolf card to even go hit a golf ball.
[02:50:22.333 --> 02:50:26.394]  Or if I want to go fly, I have to show my ID, which I have to maintain.
[02:50:26.394 --> 02:50:27.914]  I have to go... You're being racist.
[02:50:27.914 --> 02:50:28.554]  You're being racist.
[02:50:28.554 --> 02:50:35.936]  No, the Democrats in multiple states and multiple cities, California, Illinois, others, have had bills to let illegals vote.
[02:50:37.089 --> 02:50:38.010]  Why are you against illegals?
[02:50:38.010 --> 02:50:40.653]  I can't go to China and vote?
[02:50:40.653 --> 02:50:49.062]  I can't go outside the VA and get healthcare unless the VA goes, okay, you can go outside to a better doctor, which never hardly happens.
[02:50:49.062 --> 02:50:49.502]  Thank you.
[02:50:49.502 --> 02:50:50.363]  God bless you, Charles.
[02:50:50.363 --> 02:50:51.725]  More calls straight ahead with Joe Biggs.
[02:50:51.725 --> 02:50:52.846]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:50:52.846 --> 02:50:53.987]  Infowars.com.
[02:50:53.987 --> 02:50:56.190]  While it's still there, please spread the word.
[02:50:59.982 --> 02:51:04.768]  To a professional trader in precious metals, the key is spot price.
[02:51:04.768 --> 02:51:10.014]  Spot price is market price, what gold or silver actually costs on the exchange.
[02:51:10.014 --> 02:51:15.241]  Regular people looking to invest never get spot price, because resellers add fees for everything.
[02:51:15.521 --> 02:51:18.823]  Refining, minting, brokerage costs, commissions.
[02:51:18.823 --> 02:51:21.385]  The public is never offered spot price.
[02:51:21.385 --> 02:51:22.866]  Until now.
[02:51:22.866 --> 02:51:25.068]  In a limited new customer outreach, J.M.
[02:51:25.068 --> 02:51:29.951]  Bullion offers you the chance to own a 10-ounce bar of pure silver at spot price.
[02:51:29.951 --> 02:51:33.534]  No fees, commissions, markups, not even a shipping cost.
[02:51:33.534 --> 02:51:34.474]  Now through J.M.
[02:51:34.474 --> 02:51:38.037]  Bullion, own the most real investment of all at real cost.
[02:51:38.337 --> 02:51:41.080]  Not a piece of paper from Wall Street or a bank.
[02:51:41.080 --> 02:51:44.424]  A 10-ounce bar of silver at spot price.
[02:51:44.424 --> 02:51:46.306]  That's a solid investment.
[02:51:46.306 --> 02:51:47.627]  But you must act now.
[02:51:47.627 --> 02:51:52.292]  Go online to RealPriceSilver.com for this limited time offer.
[02:51:52.292 --> 02:51:54.855]  That's RealPriceSilver.com.
[02:51:54.855 --> 02:51:57.238]  RealPriceSilver.com.
[02:51:57.238 --> 02:51:58.539]  Limit one offer per household.
[02:51:58.539 --> 02:51:59.280]  50 United States only.
[02:52:00.586 --> 02:52:02.207]  What's it going to take?
[02:52:02.207 --> 02:52:03.667]  Another news story?
[02:52:03.667 --> 02:52:06.228]  You've heard about Infidel Body Armor for years.
[02:52:06.228 --> 02:52:08.389]  You know you should have a set.
[02:52:08.389 --> 02:52:09.729]  So should your wife.
[02:52:09.729 --> 02:52:11.250]  Things aren't getting better.
[02:52:11.250 --> 02:52:12.610]  They're getting worse.
[02:52:12.610 --> 02:52:15.231]  Thousands already wear Infidel Body Armor.
[02:52:15.231 --> 02:52:16.612]  Now get yours.
[02:52:16.612 --> 02:52:20.593]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com and check out today's specials.

[02:54:07.095 --> 02:54:10.478]  Yes, good afternoon gentlemen.
[02:54:10.478 --> 02:54:16.342]  I've been an avid listener of your show for quite a while and I'm very well aware of what the New World Order is doing to us.
[02:54:35.612 --> 02:54:36.873]  And I'm an inventor.
[02:54:36.873 --> 02:54:55.410]  I kind of think out of the box on occasion, and the thought occurred to me that this Government Continuity of Government program that has been in effect for years might present a possible means for the New World Order to decapitate our entire government in one fell swoop.
[02:54:55.410 --> 02:54:56.051]  For example,
[02:54:56.806 --> 02:55:03.048]  Sure, it's set up for outside globalists to have a total track into everything, to be able to bring down our nation anytime they want.
[02:55:03.048 --> 02:55:11.270]  That's actually the secret of world government, is that they then hold the technotronic, technocracy keys above it, and can take down any country they want, whenever they want.
[02:55:11.270 --> 02:55:12.970]  So you've hit the nail on the head there.
[02:55:12.970 --> 02:55:17.892]  It's kind of like Operation Valkyrie in reverse.
[02:55:17.892 --> 02:55:25.534]  If they stage a false attack, or if there's some sort of a major emergency where they can get all of the members of Congress into these underground facilities,
[02:55:26.651 --> 02:55:38.994]  Uh, these facilities are already, uh, set up with air ventilation, and, uh, it would be relatively simple for them to just, uh, nerve gas everybody in one fell swoop and decapitate the entire government.
[02:55:38.994 --> 02:55:47.276]  And also, if members of the military are ordered to go into these facilities at the same time, they would- Yeah, that's who you gotta worry about is the Patriots.
[02:55:47.276 --> 02:55:48.516]  Listen, Warren Buffet-
[02:55:49.724 --> 02:55:55.427]  Called top billionaires the week before 9-11 and said it's all expenses paid, it's secret, I can't tell you.
[02:55:55.427 --> 02:55:58.389]  You need to fly into Omaha on this night.
[02:55:58.389 --> 02:56:02.051]  And they were off at Air Force Base in the morning with big screen TVs.
[02:56:02.051 --> 02:56:05.353]  It's all secret what happened as the towers were hit.
[02:56:05.353 --> 02:56:09.916]  And a few that have leaked it said they were called there, quote, for their safety.
[02:56:09.916 --> 02:56:10.776]  Can you believe that?
[02:56:10.776 --> 02:56:12.637]  So yeah, it's amazing, man.
[02:56:12.637 --> 02:56:14.758]  They know what they're doing.
[02:56:14.758 --> 02:56:16.700]  But he's such a nice old man.
[02:56:16.700 --> 02:56:18.060]  Yeah.
[02:56:18.060 --> 02:56:18.941]  He loves Obama, though.
[02:56:21.377 --> 02:56:22.458]  That's an interesting point, Hans.
[02:56:22.458 --> 02:56:23.519]  Anything else?
[02:56:23.519 --> 02:56:25.040]  Yeah.
[02:56:25.040 --> 02:56:25.440]  Go ahead.
[02:56:25.440 --> 02:56:26.041]  Hello?
[02:56:26.041 --> 02:56:26.501]  Yes, sir.
[02:56:26.501 --> 02:56:27.121]  Yeah.
[02:56:27.121 --> 02:56:35.387]  If you remember that movie where he gets all the crime bosses into this one facility of his and he nerve gasses them and takes all their money.
[02:56:35.387 --> 02:56:40.471]  This is something similar to what they're going to do to our members of Congress.
[02:56:40.471 --> 02:56:48.117]  And these people better realize that they think they've earned a seat at the table, but in reality, they're just dooming themselves.
[02:56:48.951 --> 02:56:52.274]  Once they enter these facilities, I don't think they'll be coming out of them again.
[02:56:52.274 --> 02:56:58.079]  Yeah, you're talking about the old goldfinger, my Ian Fleming, MI6.
[02:56:58.079 --> 02:57:01.802]  Let me expand on that, and I appreciate your call.
[02:57:01.802 --> 02:57:09.089]  That's kind of an allegory for what happens under any totalitarian system throughout the ages, that the people that help overthrow the free state
[02:57:11.664 --> 02:57:16.307]  They then are the first people killed by the actual controllers that brought them in.
[02:57:16.307 --> 02:57:21.069]  So yes, the dumbest people are the ones that go along with the takeover.
[02:57:21.069 --> 02:57:25.752]  A lot of times they'll flip it back to a more populist movement, the elite will, because that's more stable.
[02:57:25.752 --> 02:57:29.834]  Once they've taken out the elite, a lot of times a takeover isn't even about robbing the general public.
[02:57:29.834 --> 02:57:30.675]  You just hit it.
[02:57:30.675 --> 02:57:32.476]  It's about knocking out the political class.
[02:57:34.039 --> 02:57:35.602]  Yeah, I agree completely.
[02:57:35.602 --> 02:57:38.787]  Like I said, we've pussified these people so much.
[02:57:38.787 --> 02:57:40.529]  The left are crying.
[02:57:40.529 --> 02:57:43.154]  They want to bring in these radical jihadis.
[02:57:43.154 --> 02:57:45.297]  But who do they think are going to be the first ones to take them out?
[02:57:45.297 --> 02:57:47.520]  It's going to be the guys that they're fighting for.
[02:57:48.666 --> 02:57:54.630]  Huffington Post and others over and over again say, wear a burqa, cover your face, make the muscles feel good, plus it's sexy.
[02:57:54.630 --> 02:57:55.811]  And now you have Obama coming out.
[02:57:55.811 --> 02:58:01.715]  He did this interview on the Golf Channel the other day where he goes, well I'm not, he's like, I really don't want to get out, I'm being forced out.
[02:58:01.715 --> 02:58:04.537]  And he was joked many times about how- Yeah, by the way, will you guys cue that up?
[02:58:04.537 --> 02:58:05.558]  It's only like a 30 second clip.
[02:58:05.558 --> 02:58:09.081]  He's on there with that fop guy and then, yeah, go ahead.
[02:58:09.081 --> 02:58:09.461]  Oh, we have it.
[02:58:09.461 --> 02:58:10.602]  Here, let's play the fop clip right now.
[02:58:10.602 --> 02:58:12.043]  Here it is.
[02:58:12.043 --> 02:58:14.785]  Have you taken any divots out of the south lawn here?
[02:58:14.785 --> 02:58:15.786]  The rust is a little thick here.
[02:58:15.786 --> 02:58:17.066]  I don't practice that much.
[02:58:18.325 --> 02:58:19.097]  You know, I'm a...
[02:58:21.227 --> 02:58:25.610]  I'm not a hack, but I'm not quitting my day job.
[02:58:25.610 --> 02:58:29.213]  I'd say... Actually, you are quitting your day job fairly shortly.
[02:58:29.213 --> 02:58:31.154]  Well, then I may get good.
[02:58:31.154 --> 02:58:32.115]  I'm being forced out.
[02:58:32.115 --> 02:58:35.077]  I didn't quit.
[02:58:35.077 --> 02:58:36.758]  I'd say... Alright, that's good.
[02:58:36.758 --> 02:58:40.600]  And again, I'm not against... This guy's a dandy.
[02:58:40.600 --> 02:58:47.906]  In an interview with George Herbert Walker Bush and W. And W, in the last interview with that guy, is literally wearing a dandy outfit.
[02:58:47.906 --> 02:58:48.346]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:49.884 --> 02:58:54.967]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and nutraceuticals.

[02:59:52.347 --> 03:00:01.170]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:01.170 --> 03:00:01.610]  Rising up!
[03:00:01.610 --> 03:00:02.531]  Rallying patriots worldwide!
[03:00:02.531 --> 03:00:03.051]  It's Joe Biggs!
[03:00:12.911 --> 03:00:13.992]  You know how my psychology works?
[03:00:13.992 --> 03:00:17.456]  I know Fox News has been in controlled opposition forever.
[03:00:17.456 --> 03:00:19.538]  The control the libertarian movement.
[03:00:36.095 --> 03:00:46.563]  To know they had a coup, to know they've come in, to know they had this suit planned for years, right before the election, because they can't have Fox challenging a stolen election, really is a bellwether.
[03:00:46.563 --> 03:00:48.504]  It's a canary in the coal mine.
[03:00:48.504 --> 03:00:51.627]  It is the biggest canary in the coal mine.
[03:00:51.627 --> 03:00:57.391]  And I really haven't even been covering it, because it's almost like I'm celebrating over a dead corpse.
[03:00:57.391 --> 03:00:59.132]  Not that it was perfect.
[03:00:59.132 --> 03:01:00.833]  But I really should be, because I'm watching it.
[03:01:00.833 --> 03:01:03.615]  It's definitely Hillary now.
[03:01:03.615 --> 03:01:05.297]  And you can see them putting the disinfo out.
[03:01:06.662 --> 03:01:13.287]  And it's almost like I'd be celebrating over a dead corpse if I attack it, but I have to.
[03:01:13.287 --> 03:01:16.229]  It's crazy.
[03:01:16.229 --> 03:01:19.932]  It's absolutely crazy that they really did it.
[03:01:19.932 --> 03:01:21.673]  And let me tell you, Drudge and Infowars is next.
[03:01:21.673 --> 03:01:25.796]  Speaking of Drudge, I'm told it's now the top story on Drudge, we'll put that on screen.
[03:01:25.796 --> 03:01:29.999]  Twilight Zone, Orlando Terrace dead, cheers Clinton, will Hillary disavow?
[03:01:29.999 --> 03:01:30.720]  That's our story.
[03:01:31.876 --> 03:01:33.417]  So again, that's just common sense.
[03:01:33.417 --> 03:01:39.642]  We put it out, Drudge links to it, now it'll be a major talking point if you get the story out to everyone you know.
[03:01:39.642 --> 03:01:44.486]  They have to hammer Trump non-stop about David Duke.
[03:01:44.486 --> 03:01:47.188]  There should be people, media, do your job!
[03:01:47.188 --> 03:01:53.073]  There should be people out there right now on every channel going, wow, Sadiq Mateen was back there in Orlando.
[03:01:53.073 --> 03:01:54.254]  Give me a break!
[03:01:54.254 --> 03:01:57.656]  The Ku Klux Klan is completely Democrat.
[03:01:57.656 --> 03:01:59.498]  Every Grand Dragon there ever was was a Democrat.
[03:02:00.489 --> 03:02:02.009]  Well, it's Robert Byrd.
[03:02:02.009 --> 03:02:09.271]  And quite frankly, David Duke is right about we can't just have wide open borders and that there's an anti-white agenda of balkanization.
[03:02:09.271 --> 03:02:13.533]  It doesn't mean he's right about white sheets and dancing around in a KKK outfit.
[03:02:13.533 --> 03:02:17.314]  Mecha and La Raza are right about the exploitation of Hispanics in many cases.
[03:02:17.314 --> 03:02:19.594]  It doesn't mean they're right about, you know, all their crap.
[03:02:19.594 --> 03:02:19.954]  Yeah.
[03:02:19.954 --> 03:02:21.015]  I mean, look.
[03:02:21.015 --> 03:02:23.115]  Oh, Alex Jones agrees with David Duke.
[03:02:23.115 --> 03:02:25.316]  I agree with being intellectually honest, okay?
[03:02:26.136 --> 03:02:30.617]  You know, I mean, the Imperial Japanese, I didn't agree with them doing secret testing on our troops.
[03:02:30.617 --> 03:02:35.219]  But yes, we did cut off their oil, we did cut off their rubber.
[03:02:35.219 --> 03:02:37.000]  The West did push them into that.
[03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:38.680]  Does that mean I agree with what the Japanese did?
[03:02:38.680 --> 03:02:39.480]  No!
[03:02:39.480 --> 03:02:40.981]  It's just, it's reality-based, Joe.
[03:02:41.843 --> 03:02:43.384]  I mean, look at all the media now.
[03:02:43.384 --> 03:02:55.393]  Now that Fox has completely gone Clinton, mostly, you've only got InfoWars, Breitbart, and Michael Savage, who are only the other people who are giving you that other side of what's going on.
[03:02:55.393 --> 03:02:56.754]  And by the way, we should around here.
[03:02:56.754 --> 03:02:58.275]  Are we excited about there's so few of us?
[03:03:01.798 --> 03:03:09.525]  It's good that we have the people, but it's kind of sad sometimes that we don't have a lot of people out there that are on that side.
[03:03:09.525 --> 03:03:10.786]  It's creepy!
[03:03:10.786 --> 03:03:15.990]  It's like we're all alone in this one big Clinton rally and we're the only ones there.
[03:03:15.990 --> 03:03:17.972]  Because there's no one showing up at the rally.
[03:03:17.972 --> 03:03:20.274]  It's like a total hoax where they're calling it.
[03:03:20.274 --> 03:03:21.795]  They're shutting the media down.
[03:03:21.795 --> 03:03:23.497]  They're bullhorning her and she's just sitting there going,
[03:03:24.295 --> 03:03:27.478]  Well, my point is, I'm not in competition against Drudge.
[03:03:27.478 --> 03:03:29.420]  I'm not in competition against Breitbart.
[03:03:29.420 --> 03:03:32.964]  I'm not in competition against WorldNetDaily or Daily Caller.
[03:03:32.964 --> 03:03:36.668]  I mean, and none of us are perfect, but at least we don't want to destroy the country.
[03:03:36.668 --> 03:03:41.913]  And then I find the real Hillary supporters and Joe, it's like they're not home.
[03:03:42.924 --> 03:03:44.626]  Oh yeah, I like Hillary Clinton.
[03:03:44.626 --> 03:03:49.292]  It's like the one guy that Rob talked to out there in Philadelphia.
[03:03:49.292 --> 03:03:50.694]  The guy was out of his mind.
[03:03:50.694 --> 03:03:54.158]  The other guy goes, yeah, take the guns, sweep them up, get rid of them.
[03:03:54.158 --> 03:03:55.200]  Hey, what did you think about
[03:03:56.323 --> 03:03:58.864]  What did you think about, it's a daily show or one of these things?
[03:03:58.864 --> 03:04:00.565]  Oh yeah, Eric Andre.
[03:04:00.565 --> 03:04:08.309]  Oh that one, but somebody else did a clip where they go out and they ask questions but say, they quote Trump but say it was Hillary and they all agree with it.
[03:04:08.309 --> 03:04:09.170]  Yeah.
[03:04:09.170 --> 03:04:13.552]  That's the thing we found, you can say we want to put babies in blenders for Hillary, they'd say yes.
[03:04:13.552 --> 03:04:14.093]  Well of course!
[03:04:14.093 --> 03:04:18.615]  It was Jimmy Kimmel, in fact we have that clip, we ought to play that.
[03:04:18.615 --> 03:04:20.136]  Is David Knight coming in this studio or the other one?
[03:04:23.479 --> 03:04:24.180]  So he's being the other one.
[03:04:24.180 --> 03:04:27.002]  Well, that means we can come back and play the Jimmy Kimmel clip.
[03:04:27.002 --> 03:04:29.303]  In fact, we have it right now.
[03:04:29.303 --> 03:04:31.465]  We're going to come back and play that after the break.
[03:04:31.465 --> 03:04:33.587]  And David Knight is going to be taking over.
[03:04:33.587 --> 03:04:35.348]  We've got loaded phone lines.
[03:04:35.348 --> 03:04:37.149]  That will be up to David Knight.
[03:04:37.149 --> 03:04:38.090]  These are some good callers.
[03:04:38.090 --> 03:04:39.912]  They have been holding long.
[03:04:39.912 --> 03:04:42.253]  If he wants to take those phone calls.
[03:04:42.253 --> 03:04:44.715]  But I shouldn't be laughing about all this.
[03:04:44.715 --> 03:04:45.796]  It's either that or cry.
[03:04:45.796 --> 03:04:46.857]  It's like in combat.
[03:04:46.857 --> 03:04:48.478]  You have to learn to laugh at some of this stuff.
[03:04:48.478 --> 03:04:49.399]  If not, you're going to go crazy.
[03:04:51.593 --> 03:04:53.782]  I had to go nuts or I'd go crazy.
[03:04:53.782 --> 03:04:55.428]  Hillary Clinton's already going nuts.
[03:04:55.428 --> 03:04:57.114]  Oh man, I can't look at her anymore.
[03:04:58.095 --> 03:04:59.917]  I cannot look at her.
[03:04:59.917 --> 03:05:02.039]  Joe Bates here with InfoWars.com.
[03:05:02.039 --> 03:05:05.381]  CNN bashes conspiratorial questions about Hillary's health.
[03:05:05.381 --> 03:05:13.208]  CNN is attempting to dismiss questions about Hillary Clinton's health by asserting that photos which appear to show her struggling to climb some steps are old.
[03:05:13.208 --> 03:05:22.957]  However, the news network conveniently fails to mention the fact that both federal and NYPD sources have blown the whistle on Hillary's difficulties with balance and walking in the past.
[03:05:23.237 --> 03:05:33.659]  Under the headline, Drudge Report Misleads Readers With Hillary Clinton Photo, CNN's Brian Settler writes that news aggregator Matt Drudge is taking a six-month-old photo out of context.
[03:05:33.659 --> 03:05:39.961]  Settler claims that the images merely show Hillary being aided after a slip and dismisses concerns about Hillary's health.
[03:05:39.961 --> 03:05:43.101]  In addition, the claims of John Cardio are not mentioned.
[03:05:43.101 --> 03:05:49.903]  Cardio told Breitbart about two different individuals, one a federal agent and another an NYPD officer who'd worked security
[03:05:50.183 --> 03:05:55.767]  at a Hillary event in New York City, who both personally witnessed Hillary's walking difficulties.
[03:05:55.767 --> 03:05:57.409]  This has been Joe Biggs with Infowars.com.
[03:06:00.182 --> 03:06:01.624]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[03:06:01.624 --> 03:06:02.945]  It took you over a year to do it.
[03:06:02.945 --> 03:06:04.146]  Why is this so good?
[03:06:04.146 --> 03:06:09.430]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[03:06:09.430 --> 03:06:22.981]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[03:06:22.981 --> 03:06:24.343]  Right now with all the refugees,
[03:06:25.123 --> 03:06:26.764]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[03:06:26.764 --> 03:06:29.325]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[03:06:29.325 --> 03:06:30.626]  These are all parasites.
[03:06:30.626 --> 03:06:31.726]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[03:06:31.726 --> 03:06:33.067]  There's so many things that are in it.
[03:06:33.067 --> 03:06:37.589]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[03:06:37.589 --> 03:06:40.731]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[03:06:40.851 --> 03:06:43.912]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[03:06:43.912 --> 03:06:44.973]  It just came back in yesterday.
[03:06:44.973 --> 03:06:46.894]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[03:06:46.894 --> 03:06:47.914]  And folks, you can't lose.
[03:06:47.914 --> 03:06:50.615]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[03:06:50.615 --> 03:06:53.877]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[03:06:53.877 --> 03:06:56.138]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[03:06:56.138 --> 03:06:58.099]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[03:06:59.488 --> 03:07:05.996]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy.
[03:07:05.996 --> 03:07:18.791]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[03:07:18.971 --> 03:07:22.632]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[03:07:22.632 --> 03:07:29.614]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[03:07:29.614 --> 03:07:42.478]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[03:07:42.478 --> 03:07:44.038]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[03:07:44.318 --> 03:07:50.702]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.
[03:07:50.702 --> 03:07:55.646]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[03:08:14.568 --> 03:08:17.210]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:08:17.210 --> 03:08:22.614]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:08:22.614 --> 03:08:30.059]  I don't want to be there when y'all run the nation.
[03:08:30.059 --> 03:08:37.244]  I don't want to be there when y'all bridge the chain.
[03:08:37.244 --> 03:08:40.147]  Ain't no misery.
[03:08:40.147 --> 03:08:43.149]  Why are we in misery?
[03:08:43.149 --> 03:08:43.529]  Alright.
[03:08:44.980 --> 03:08:49.543]  They call us conspiracy theorists.
[03:08:49.543 --> 03:08:51.965]  Truth is, we're alive.
[03:08:51.965 --> 03:08:55.247]  They like to lock us up.
[03:08:55.247 --> 03:08:58.349]  Make us play their Pokemon.
[03:08:58.349 --> 03:08:58.990]  Not gonna happen.
[03:08:58.990 --> 03:09:04.414]  I don't want to be in your New World Order dungeon.
[03:09:04.414 --> 03:09:08.637]  I don't want to be in your globalist hell.
[03:09:08.637 --> 03:09:09.978]  Oh, there ain't no mystery.
[03:09:13.079 --> 03:09:14.808]  Why I'm in misery
[03:09:17.978 --> 03:09:19.199]  Joe Biggs is with me.
[03:09:19.199 --> 03:09:21.501]  We've got David Knight in the other studio about to hand the baton.
[03:09:21.501 --> 03:09:23.762]  Nightly News coming up tonight at 7 o'clock Central Standard Time.
[03:09:23.762 --> 03:09:28.266]  I want to thank all the viewers and listeners and affiliates and sponsors for making this possible.
[03:09:28.266 --> 03:09:29.326]  Please stop thanking me.
[03:09:29.326 --> 03:09:37.272]  It is so humbling when we're out in public, Joe Biggs, and we run into sometimes thousands of listeners and fans over a weekend at the RNC or DNC.
[03:09:37.272 --> 03:09:38.693]  It's very humbling.
[03:09:38.693 --> 03:09:45.078]  Families, their little kids, and just really all of them, their eyes are so alive, whether they be black or white or Hispanic or Asian.
[03:09:47.037 --> 03:09:51.159]  And it's just amazing to see it, and it's disproportionate black Americans.
[03:09:51.159 --> 03:10:02.125]  I mean, I gotta say, Infowars disproportionately has always had a larger group of, you know, instead of 13% of the population, I'd say, I'd say in the United States, 20-30% of our population is black.
[03:10:02.125 --> 03:10:04.907]  And I'm not gonna patronize, call you African Americans, it's a new name every week.
[03:10:04.907 --> 03:10:06.708]  Black folks are sick of all of it.
[03:10:06.708 --> 03:10:09.810]  I mean, I'm a pink folk, I kind of got, you know, goofy looking skin, but the point is,
[03:10:11.351 --> 03:10:15.494]  We're Americans, we all got red blood, and people are sick of being put in these boxes.
[03:10:15.494 --> 03:10:20.979]  And I tell you, the fact that Hillary can't get crowds anywhere, again, it's indicative she's not really ahead of Trump.
[03:10:20.979 --> 03:10:34.010]  And then we get the nomenclature, we get the diagnostics, we get the methodology, the breakdown from Reuters and AP and others, on all these polls where Hillary surged 10 to 15 points, they added 15% more Democrats!
[03:10:34.010 --> 03:10:36.813]  This is not brain surgery here, folks!
[03:10:38.910 --> 03:10:40.031]  I mean, what do you make of this?
[03:10:40.031 --> 03:10:43.373]  You get on social media, Donald Trump's exploding.
[03:10:43.373 --> 03:10:44.554]  He's everywhere.
[03:10:44.554 --> 03:10:48.356]  He's all over Reddit, he's all over Facebook, Twitter, everything.
[03:10:48.356 --> 03:10:50.898]  Despite the censorship?
[03:10:50.898 --> 03:10:54.760]  There's a larger amount of accounts that are pro-Trump than there are Hillary Clinton.
[03:10:54.760 --> 03:10:57.241]  And when you look at the Hillary Clinton pages, guess what they are?
[03:10:57.241 --> 03:11:03.025]  Hillary for prison, handcuffed Hillary, Hillary doesn't belong here, you know, Hillary for saying Quentin, all this stuff.
[03:11:03.025 --> 03:11:04.726]  By the way, that was in the article about it.
[03:11:05.106 --> 03:11:08.507]  Hillary's most popular thing on social media is Hillary for President.
[03:11:08.507 --> 03:11:09.788]  Exactly, and that is amazing.
[03:11:09.788 --> 03:11:15.290]  I'm sorry, it's funny.
[03:11:15.290 --> 03:11:21.253]  I want to play this clip, but first, David, I want to play this clip from one of the national TV shows.
[03:11:21.253 --> 03:11:22.213]  Who is it, Jimmy Kimmel?
[03:11:22.213 --> 03:11:23.154]  Yeah.
[03:11:23.154 --> 03:11:25.435]  Where they do the same methodology we do.
[03:11:25.435 --> 03:11:30.757]  Whether it's Austin, or whether it's Cleveland, or whether it's Philadelphia, or whether it's LA.
[03:11:32.057 --> 03:11:38.439]  Our reporters, or our auxiliary reporters, like Mark Dice, he gets criticized all the way.
[03:11:38.439 --> 03:11:40.940]  They go, why'd you just show dumb people?
[03:11:40.940 --> 03:11:42.040]  We're not doing that.
[03:11:42.040 --> 03:11:43.021]  There's a lot of dumb people.
[03:11:43.021 --> 03:11:52.964]  We are showing you basically everyone that had something to say, and 8 out of 10 in Austin, Democrats want gun owners, enforce labor, and want to execute us.
[03:11:52.964 --> 03:11:55.905]  8 out of 10 want to kill newborn babies or up to age 3.
[03:11:55.905 --> 03:11:56.905]  Post-birth abortion.
[03:11:56.905 --> 03:12:00.267]  8 out of 10 want to ban homes bigger than 250 square feet.
[03:12:02.322 --> 03:12:04.243]  This is a cult of psychopaths.
[03:12:04.243 --> 03:12:05.304]  I mean, these are lunatics.
[03:12:05.304 --> 03:12:06.345]  I don't know what you call them.
[03:12:06.345 --> 03:12:07.606]  I'm not a psychiatrist.
[03:12:07.606 --> 03:12:08.306]  But I know this.
[03:12:08.306 --> 03:12:10.368]  They're freaking crazy.
[03:12:10.368 --> 03:12:11.609]  But you've got to add one thing.
[03:12:11.609 --> 03:12:13.630]  For Obama, for Hillary.
[03:12:13.630 --> 03:12:16.692]  And that's what Jimmy Kimmel's show illustrated.
[03:12:16.692 --> 03:12:18.393]  Look at David Knight's take on it.
[03:12:18.393 --> 03:12:23.117]  If you say it's for Hillary, if you say Hillary said it, they will support it.
[03:12:23.117 --> 03:12:24.898]  That's called being in a cult.
[03:12:24.898 --> 03:12:26.039]  If Donald Trump came out and said,
[03:12:27.498 --> 03:12:31.020]  I want compulsory national service, and I want you to worship me as God.
[03:12:31.020 --> 03:12:33.541]  I'd say, I'm done with Trump, he's crazy, blah blah blah.
[03:12:33.541 --> 03:12:35.262]  But see, not with them.
[03:12:35.262 --> 03:12:40.265]  If you had a cult follower, well Trump wants everybody to drink cyanide Kool-Aid, they'd say, yes, yes, drink it.
[03:12:40.265 --> 03:12:41.546]  But see, Trump isn't doing that.
[03:12:41.546 --> 03:12:44.848]  This is literal cult behavior.
[03:12:44.848 --> 03:12:45.428]  Let's go to the clip.
[03:12:47.492 --> 03:12:54.674]  When Hillary Clinton said, I see improved relations with Russia from a position of strength only as possible.
[03:12:54.674 --> 03:12:55.794]  I agree with Hillary.
[03:12:55.794 --> 03:13:02.956]  Hillary Clinton said, immigration is a privilege and we should not let anyone into this country who doesn't support our communities, all of our communities.
[03:13:02.956 --> 03:13:05.837]  Well, I'd virtually have to agree with that.
[03:13:05.837 --> 03:13:10.978]  Hillary said, in order to achieve the American dream, let people keep more money in their pockets and increase after-tax wages.
[03:13:12.319 --> 03:13:16.502]  Yes, okay.
[03:13:16.502 --> 03:13:23.147]  That's a great idea so that we can start to move everybody up and start moving people out of the level of poverty.
[03:13:23.147 --> 03:13:27.230]  And obviously runs fairly severe contrast to what Donald Trump is proposing?
[03:13:27.230 --> 03:13:27.791]  Absolutely.
[03:13:27.791 --> 03:13:30.393]  Many of our comments run severe contrast to Donald Trump.
[03:13:30.393 --> 03:13:33.095]  What do you think of this quote from Hillary?
[03:13:33.095 --> 03:13:36.758]  There's nothing I love more than women, but they're really a lot different than portrayed.
[03:13:36.758 --> 03:13:40.061]  They're far worse than men, far more aggressive, and boy can they be smart.
[03:13:40.861 --> 03:13:42.262]  Um, you know, I agree.
[03:13:42.262 --> 03:13:46.986]  I've worked for 38 years in the hospital with women and that's very accurate.
[03:13:46.986 --> 03:13:50.649]  And you think that's obviously a sharp contrast to her opponent?
[03:13:50.649 --> 03:13:51.809]  Absolutely.
[03:13:51.809 --> 03:13:54.872]  Hillary Clinton said, I like the concept of local education.
[03:13:54.872 --> 03:13:56.173]  I want to get rid of Common Core.
[03:13:56.173 --> 03:13:58.314]  I think Common Core is a disaster.
[03:13:58.314 --> 03:14:00.576]  Well, I'm an educator.
[03:14:00.576 --> 03:14:01.837]  I'm a school teacher.
[03:14:01.837 --> 03:14:04.879]  I think Common Core is a disaster too.
[03:14:04.879 --> 03:14:08.962]  And what do you think of this, Hillary, quote, I have never seen a thin person drinking Diet Coke.
[03:14:09.827 --> 03:14:12.929]  Never seen a thin person drinking Diet Coke.
[03:14:12.929 --> 03:14:14.671]  Well, let me tell you something.
[03:14:14.671 --> 03:14:17.513]  Diet Coke does not make you thin.
[03:14:17.513 --> 03:14:20.395]  So you would say, get rid of Common Core, keep the Diet Coke?
[03:14:20.395 --> 03:14:21.075]  Keep the Diet Coke.
[03:14:21.075 --> 03:14:23.477]  What do you think of this Hillary Clinton quote?
[03:14:23.477 --> 03:14:24.618]  I am opposed to gay marriage.
[03:14:25.880 --> 03:14:28.161]  Well, I've heard that a lot from a lot of politicians.
[03:14:28.161 --> 03:14:31.262]  It's all about the timing though, isn't it?
[03:14:31.262 --> 03:14:32.723]  No, hey, she's for us now.
[03:14:32.723 --> 03:14:34.263]  Yay!
[03:14:34.263 --> 03:14:35.464]  I'll take that as a win.
[03:14:35.464 --> 03:14:37.345]  What did you think of this quote from Hillary Clinton?
[03:14:37.345 --> 03:14:44.167]  While Bette Midler is an extremely unattractive woman, I refuse to say that because I always insist on being politically correct.
[03:14:44.167 --> 03:14:45.828]  I am sure that she never said that.
[03:14:50.763 --> 03:14:51.563]  I can't make any guarantees.
[03:14:51.563 --> 03:14:55.125]  The one Democratic operative, kind of a master spider, got what it was.
[03:14:55.125 --> 03:14:56.706]  David Knight, is that not illustrative?
[03:14:56.706 --> 03:15:00.648]  Like, we're not out trying to make people look dumb.
[03:15:00.648 --> 03:15:03.949]  We show the people this is how crazy they are.
[03:15:03.949 --> 03:15:06.990]  If you just say it's for Hillary or Obama, they go along with it.
[03:15:06.990 --> 03:15:12.273]  David actually spoke to this lady at the DNC and laid out every reason why she shouldn't be president.
[03:15:12.273 --> 03:15:14.154]  She goes, well, I still think she's trustworthy.
[03:15:14.154 --> 03:15:14.514]  Oh, yeah.
[03:15:15.254 --> 03:15:18.357]  Alex, I spent a week at the DNC talking to these very people.
[03:15:18.357 --> 03:15:19.057]  It is a herd mentality.
[03:15:19.057 --> 03:15:20.739]  They need a t-shirt that says, I'm with herd.
[03:15:33.829 --> 03:15:34.829]  Because that's really what it is.
[03:15:34.829 --> 03:15:37.470]  There's a great political cartoon that we tweeted out.
[03:15:37.470 --> 03:15:39.690]  My wife saw it, I tweeted it out as well.
[03:15:39.690 --> 03:15:48.412]  It's all these sheep around at the Democrat convention and they're saying she would never do anything bad, you know, and she would never pull the wool over our eyes, okay?
[03:15:48.412 --> 03:15:49.472]  They are sheep!
[03:15:49.472 --> 03:15:57.474]  No matter what you tell them, they always say, you know, she's loyal and trustworthy and honest and, you know, you can't convince them otherwise.
[03:15:57.474 --> 03:15:58.994]  Why the Hillary of armed guards but you can't?
[03:16:02.495 --> 03:16:03.802]  A lot of vegetable borders that we can't...
[03:16:07.601 --> 03:16:09.303]  Alex, there's an update.
[03:16:09.303 --> 03:16:13.686]  Mikhail Thelin just handed me a new story at InfoWars.com.
[03:16:13.686 --> 03:16:17.689]  Wikileaks is not convinced at all that Russia had anything to do with it.
[03:16:17.689 --> 03:16:19.370]  Of course, they were the ones who released the information.
[03:16:19.370 --> 03:16:19.491]  Sure.
[03:16:19.491 --> 03:16:21.952]  More and more of this points towards our own private intelligence.
[03:16:21.952 --> 03:16:30.839]  Yes, but they just put out, tweeted out, a $20,000 reward for information on the murdered DNC staffer, Seth Rich.
[03:16:30.839 --> 03:16:31.000]  Who did?
[03:16:31.000 --> 03:16:31.880]  He was beaten.
[03:16:31.880 --> 03:16:32.521]  Wikileaks did.
[03:16:32.961 --> 03:16:36.783]  They put out a $20,000 reward for information about this DNC staffer.
[03:16:36.783 --> 03:16:41.906]  Wow, that goes towards what you were saying earlier, and others were saying that that may be the leak source.
[03:16:41.906 --> 03:16:44.207]  Yeah, because he was a data analyst for the DNC.
[03:16:44.207 --> 03:16:47.529]  They said if anybody could have gotten a hold of that information, it would have been him.
[03:16:47.529 --> 03:16:51.131]  Assange better release his info now, he's not safe in that embassy.
[03:16:51.131 --> 03:16:55.194]  And then Assange said that it was not Russia, so definitely it could point to someone like this.
[03:16:56.343 --> 03:17:01.124]  And this is going to go to who else had ties with Seth Rich and who else had that kind of access.
[03:17:01.124 --> 03:17:06.326]  That's like five different DNC people, three of them involved with the technicals dying in the last month.
[03:17:06.326 --> 03:17:10.607]  And of course he was beaten and shot and he was not robbed, okay?
[03:17:10.607 --> 03:17:16.569]  I know this is DC and it's a model of a criminal city, but he was not robbed.
[03:17:16.569 --> 03:17:21.751]  So, you know, all these different things, of course, it's just a conspiracy theory, I'm sure, Hillary Clinton would say.
[03:17:22.099 --> 03:17:25.121]  I mean, he could have shot himself in the back of the head twice, that's kind of normal.
[03:17:25.121 --> 03:17:27.482]  Yeah, don't be racist against bullets.
[03:17:27.482 --> 03:17:30.063]  Getting serious here though, wow, WikiLeaks is coming out and saying this.
[03:17:30.063 --> 03:17:34.606]  Well, Assange has pointed out that what he's got is supposedly going to bring down Hillary.
[03:17:34.606 --> 03:17:36.167]  I don't know what he's waiting for, David.
[03:17:37.319 --> 03:17:38.359]  Yeah, I don't know.
[03:17:38.359 --> 03:17:41.240]  I've got another article from Julian Assange.
[03:17:41.240 --> 03:17:47.822]  He went on Russia Today and he talked about the fact that, of course this is an article from Steve Watson that's on Infowars.com.
[03:17:47.822 --> 03:17:52.943]  Assange pointed out the fact that Trump really doesn't have any connections in Russia.
[03:17:52.943 --> 03:17:57.165]  He hasn't been able to build any hotels since Putin took office there.
[03:17:57.165 --> 03:17:59.065]  So he doesn't have any influence there.
[03:17:59.065 --> 03:18:00.345]  He can't even get a hotel built.
[03:18:00.345 --> 03:18:05.907]  And yet Hillary Clinton, as he pointed out, was involved in that massive uranium deal that we've talked about for so long.
[03:18:06.147 --> 03:18:12.291]  Well, he said that she's got more connections to Russia than anybody he's ever seen, except for the Saudis, and she's totally run by them.
[03:18:12.291 --> 03:18:13.351]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:18:13.351 --> 03:18:14.072]  Absolutely.
[03:18:14.072 --> 03:18:17.013]  Yeah, that's a key point, is the Saudi-Arabian connection.
[03:18:17.013 --> 03:18:22.677]  And by the way, that's what Russia's supposed to do with its intelligence agencies, is fight for Russia.
[03:18:22.677 --> 03:18:26.018]  And then we're supposed to fight for us, and Putin gets that.
[03:18:26.018 --> 03:18:28.100]  It's just we're not going to have nuclear war with each other.
[03:18:28.760 --> 03:18:33.525]  Yeah, I don't understand why people are so obsessed with, like, wanting to make them our enemy.
[03:18:33.525 --> 03:18:38.389]  When we have one candidate in Trump who wants to make him an ally, leave him be, let him do what they want to do.
[03:18:38.389 --> 03:18:39.611]  Well, look at all the Islamic terror.
[03:18:39.611 --> 03:18:40.712]  It'd be perfect to link up with Russia.
[03:18:42.270 --> 03:18:50.938]  Yeah, you know, when we look at what's going on with Russia, I had these two women that I talked to that were there at the convention trying to lobby on behalf of Ukraine.
[03:18:50.938 --> 03:18:56.422]  One of them wanted to sell the idea that Donald Trump was involved with the Russians to take down the DNC.
[03:18:56.422 --> 03:19:06.912]  She was the one that I went back and forth with and said, really, do you understand the history of how the security establishment has come after legitimate whistleblowers like Thomas Drake?
[03:19:07.412 --> 03:19:08.313]  Do you understand that?
[03:19:08.313 --> 03:19:12.335]  Do you understand what she really did and how she exposed people?
[03:19:12.335 --> 03:19:16.197]  Many people they believe died because of her security leaks.
[03:19:16.197 --> 03:19:26.043]  And then the other woman wanted to push for the fact that we needed to step things up and send in lethal aid to Ukraine to fight the Russians and the Crimea.
[03:19:26.243 --> 03:19:34.787]  And I said, really, do you think we really want to go to war in order to stop this dispute of secession and civil war between Crimea and the Ukraine?
[03:19:34.787 --> 03:19:39.549]  Of course, she thinks that Ukraine should secede from Russia, but not Crimea from Ukraine.
[03:19:39.549 --> 03:19:42.770]  And she doesn't even know that George Soros started the whole thing to begin with with Hillary.
[03:19:42.770 --> 03:19:52.154]  And again, not bashing women, but it is archetypal to have all these weird power-tripping women in super suits and fancy outfits blustering how they're going to kick the Russians' butts.
[03:19:52.154 --> 03:19:54.455]  It just reeks of idiocy.
[03:19:54.455 --> 03:19:55.196]  It's crazy.
[03:19:55.896 --> 03:19:59.037]  And it won't help our country either, but it'll help the big defense contractors.
[03:19:59.037 --> 03:20:00.017]  David Knight takes over.
[03:20:00.017 --> 03:20:04.239]  By now, you know the smart way to buy emergency food storage is calories per dollar.

[03:20:14.762 --> 03:20:18.463]  Most 30-day kits don't have enough calories to sustain you for more than a week.
[03:20:18.463 --> 03:20:20.804]  They just don't have enough nutrition to do the job.

[03:21:09.549 --> 03:21:12.373]  I had my electricity turned off nine times.
[03:21:12.373 --> 03:21:16.458]  But I figured out a way to quit my job and find financial freedom in real estate.

[03:22:00.984 --> 03:22:05.490]  Do you know that good digestion is your body's first line of defense?
[03:22:05.490 --> 03:22:08.434]  Millions of Americans suffer from poor digestion.
[03:22:08.434 --> 03:22:15.704]  It shows up in the form of heartburn, acid reflux, GERD, irritable bowel syndrome, indigestion, constipation, diarrhea, and many other symptoms.
[03:22:16.164 --> 03:22:19.746]  Healthy digestion relies on armies of friendly bacteria.
[03:22:19.746 --> 03:22:22.628]  These good bugs keep bad bugs in check.
[03:22:22.628 --> 03:22:30.714]  Probe Immune, a new, uniquely developed probiotic is scientifically proven to get to your gut and deliver the benefits of improved digestion.

[03:23:56.111 --> 03:23:57.092]  Come and take it.
[03:24:10.109 --> 03:24:13.753]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Tuesday, August 9th, 2016.
[03:24:13.753 --> 03:24:15.095]  I'm David Knight.
[03:24:15.095 --> 03:24:18.058]  We're just talking about a breaking story.
[03:24:18.058 --> 03:24:27.868]  WikiLeaks offering a $20,000 reward for information on the murder of a DNC staffer, that's Seth Rich, who was beaten and shot to death in DC.
[03:24:27.868 --> 03:24:30.832]  We're going to have more on that story as well as more information about
[03:24:31.332 --> 03:24:37.218]  What Julian Assange said about Hillary, what Hillary said about WikiLeaks, we're going to have all that back and forth.
[03:24:37.218 --> 03:24:41.642]  As well as, of course, the top story on Drudge Report is Twilight Zone.
[03:24:41.642 --> 03:24:44.765]  Orlando Terrace dad cheers the Clintons, okay?
[03:24:44.765 --> 03:24:46.867]  And will Hillary disown this?
[03:24:46.867 --> 03:24:47.648]  That's the question.
[03:24:48.348 --> 03:24:49.489]  So we're going to cover that.
[03:24:49.489 --> 03:24:53.253]  That's our story at InfoWars.com by Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:24:53.253 --> 03:24:58.498]  We're going to take a look at what we've now learned about Hillary's biggest Taliban.
[03:24:58.498 --> 03:25:00.680]  That's what the Daily Caller calls them.
[03:25:00.680 --> 03:25:04.744]  Of course, we've got the Taliban now, we've got Sharia Khan, a couple of guys.
[03:25:04.744 --> 03:25:07.707]  I think it's very telling, the hypocrisy of Hillary Clinton.
[03:25:08.267 --> 03:25:13.768]  But before we get to those stories, I want to play for you some other breaking information that we've got here.
[03:25:13.768 --> 03:25:16.329]  This is an exclusive we got here.
[03:25:16.329 --> 03:25:19.970]  This is a new phone call message that's been intercepted.
[03:25:19.970 --> 03:25:24.171]  This was sent from Ahmed Dinejab to Barack Obama.
[03:25:24.171 --> 03:25:25.831]  But of course, they're friends.
[03:25:25.831 --> 03:25:29.372]  So, Ahmed Dinejab, understand, calls him Barry.
[03:25:29.372 --> 03:25:31.533]  You'll hear him call him Barry in this clip.
[03:25:31.533 --> 03:25:34.173]  Let's run that clip.
[03:25:34.173 --> 03:25:35.894]  Yeah, what can I do for you?
[03:25:37.188 --> 03:25:41.192]  Show me the money.
[03:25:41.192 --> 03:25:43.755]  Barry, show me the money, okay?
[03:25:43.755 --> 03:25:53.965]  Ahmed Dinejab is telling Obama, even after all of this cash just broke this last week, I guess he decided it was time to double down and really punish his good friend Barry.
[03:25:53.965 --> 03:25:59.450]  And so he's telling him, come on man, you still have time to send me the other two billion dollars I say you owe me, okay?
[03:26:00.331 --> 03:26:02.952]  If he was Jewish, they would call that chutzpah, okay?
[03:26:02.952 --> 03:26:03.472]  But he's not.
[03:26:03.472 --> 03:26:04.973]  He's Iranian, okay?
[03:26:04.973 --> 03:26:10.534]  Now, of course, he sends him this letter, and it begins with a traditional Islamic greeting.
[03:26:10.534 --> 03:26:12.995]  As-salamu alaykum, I guess, if that's the way you pronounce it.
[03:26:12.995 --> 03:26:17.476]  I'm sure I'll become much more of an expert with all the Muslims that we're bringing into this country.
[03:26:17.476 --> 03:26:21.038]  I'll be able to pronounce that precisely very shortly, I'm sure.
[03:26:21.038 --> 03:26:23.838]  But he went on to say, your campaign slogan was change.
[03:26:23.838 --> 03:26:27.600]  You claim to be determined to change those policies as well as your behavior.
[03:26:27.600 --> 03:26:28.180]  So, in other words,
[03:26:28.780 --> 03:26:30.420]  Barry, send me the money!
[03:26:30.420 --> 03:26:31.501]  Send me your change!
[03:26:31.501 --> 03:26:34.882]  All your change, you can send it in any kind of currency you want.
[03:26:34.882 --> 03:26:36.802]  Just put it on the plane and fly it over.
[03:26:36.802 --> 03:26:43.064]  You know, they had to have a plane to get that $400 million worth of cash in foreign currency to them.
[03:26:43.064 --> 03:26:45.764]  I wonder how many planes it would take to get $2 billion.
[03:26:45.764 --> 03:26:49.925]  You know, we could work that out mathematically with a lot of, how many pallets would that be?
[03:26:49.925 --> 03:26:56.167]  But remember that in April, the Supreme Court ruled that Iranian assets worth $2 billion must be paid to American families.
[03:26:56.647 --> 03:27:01.469]  Whose relatives were killed in Beirut and Saudi Arabian military attacks that the U.S.
[03:27:01.469 --> 03:27:03.869]  government said were the cause of Iran.
[03:27:03.869 --> 03:27:08.391]  They took place in 1983, 1996, the Khobar Tower bombings.
[03:27:08.391 --> 03:27:12.712]  Understand how this is rolled out by the Democrats, okay?
[03:27:12.712 --> 03:27:15.553]  We had Hillary Clinton say, hey, this is an old story.
[03:27:16.053 --> 03:27:19.274]  No, it's an old conspiracy, okay?
[03:27:19.274 --> 03:27:22.436]  This is something we didn't learn about until last Wednesday.
[03:27:22.436 --> 03:27:25.477]  It's not even been a week, but immediately she said this is an old story.
[03:27:25.477 --> 03:27:36.301]  What was new about it was the fact that we saw for a fact that Wall Street Journal and others uncovered the fact that this was done as a money laundering expedition.
[03:27:36.301 --> 03:27:38.402]  Of course, as a National Review pointed out,
[03:27:39.281 --> 03:27:39.421]  I don't
[03:27:54.361 --> 03:27:54.961]  We're good to go.
[03:28:20.211 --> 03:28:21.792]  So, okay, now it's a ransom.
[03:28:21.792 --> 03:28:23.733]  We can call it iRansom, okay?
[03:28:23.733 --> 03:28:28.074]  That's what it ought to be, instead of a Watergate or some Ransomgate.
[03:28:28.074 --> 03:28:32.016]  It should be called the iRansom story here.
[03:28:32.016 --> 03:28:34.937]  Now, Barack Obama said, well, we had to do that.
[03:28:34.937 --> 03:28:36.158]  We can't just write them a check.
[03:28:37.000 --> 03:28:43.282]  A National Review said, that's right, you can't just write them a check because that would be a violation of law.
[03:28:43.282 --> 03:28:51.124]  That would be a violation of your own sanctions that you have renewed every year, that have been renewed every year since 1995 when Bill Clinton put them on Iran.
[03:28:51.124 --> 03:28:52.164]  Okay?
[03:28:52.164 --> 03:28:59.546]  Understand the fact that when the Department of Justice said, we don't want you to do this, they weren't saying they didn't want to do that because it was bad policy.
[03:28:59.546 --> 03:29:00.926]  That was because it was illegal.
[03:29:01.386 --> 03:29:04.629]  And let me read you some of the laws here, okay?
[03:29:04.629 --> 03:29:13.495]  Just five months ago, as a matter of fact, after I ransom, Obama said, Iran has been designated, this is his statement, okay?
[03:29:13.495 --> 03:29:16.097]  Has been designated a state sponsor of terrorism in 1984.
[03:29:16.097 --> 03:29:19.240]  Iran has continued its terrorist related activities in 2015.
[03:29:21.121 --> 03:29:28.623]  And then, of course, the law says the exportation, sale, supply, directly or indirectly from the U.S., okay, wherever it's located, is prohibited.
[03:29:28.623 --> 03:29:34.544]  On the very same day they got the hostages and gave them the secret payoff, the Treasury Department said the clearing of U.S.
[03:29:34.544 --> 03:29:42.686]  dollar or currency-denominated transactions is prohibited, and that is punishable as a felony with up to 20 years in prison.
[03:29:43.246 --> 03:29:48.850]  But of course, we have reached the point in America where powerful people are not punished according to the law.
[03:29:48.850 --> 03:29:49.450]  Just the rest of us.
[03:30:00.029 --> 03:30:02.230]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[03:30:02.230 --> 03:30:04.710]  Communist Party unites behind Hillary.
[03:30:04.710 --> 03:30:11.832]  The Communist Party USA may not control many actual votes, but what they lack in support is made up for in enthusiasm.
[03:30:11.832 --> 03:30:18.434]  That passion was in full display with a seven-person team of reporters covering their National Political Convention last month.
[03:30:18.434 --> 03:30:25.596]  And their convention was a Democratic National Convention that nominated Hillary Clinton as their undisputed candidate for president.
[03:30:25.596 --> 03:30:29.357]  Here are some examples from the editorial produced as part of that coverage
[03:30:29.577 --> 03:30:30.197]  By the team.
[03:30:59.737 --> 03:31:01.798]  Brainforce, it's completely different.
[03:31:01.798 --> 03:31:03.018]  Try a bottle of it.
[03:31:03.018 --> 03:31:04.619]  Rob Dew joins us.
[03:31:04.619 --> 03:31:07.720]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[03:31:07.720 --> 03:31:08.780]  Tell us what Brainforce did.
[03:31:08.780 --> 03:31:09.761]  I've been working all day.
[03:31:09.761 --> 03:31:12.262]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[03:31:12.262 --> 03:31:13.682]  I get in here at 830.
[03:31:13.682 --> 03:31:15.243]  I was kind of run down.
[03:31:15.583 --> 03:31:17.525]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[03:31:17.525 --> 03:31:19.407]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[03:31:19.407 --> 03:31:21.229]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[03:31:21.229 --> 03:31:22.290]  I popped two of them.
[03:31:22.290 --> 03:31:24.572]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing!
[03:31:24.572 --> 03:31:26.514]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[03:31:26.514 --> 03:31:28.035]  It's got four and a half stars.
[03:31:28.035 --> 03:31:29.356]  People really love it.
[03:31:29.356 --> 03:31:29.957]  Read about it.
[03:31:29.957 --> 03:31:33.801]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise.
[03:31:33.801 --> 03:31:39.086]  Because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[03:31:39.246 --> 03:31:43.289]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[03:31:43.289 --> 03:31:49.435]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[03:31:49.435 --> 03:31:55.340]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:31:59.482 --> 03:32:00.302]  Hey, everyone!
[03:32:00.302 --> 03:32:06.424]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side, and as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[03:32:06.424 --> 03:32:08.505]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[03:32:08.505 --> 03:32:18.789]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[03:32:18.789 --> 03:32:24.771]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[03:32:25.231 --> 03:32:46.011]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino acids it needs to do its healing work, you need to check out InfoWarsTeam.com.
[03:32:46.011 --> 03:32:47.973]  Give your body the gift of good nutrition.
[03:32:47.973 --> 03:32:48.353]  Head over to
[03:32:48.553 --> 03:32:50.393]  Infowarsteam.com.
[03:32:50.393 --> 03:32:52.354]  Your body will be very grateful.
[03:32:52.354 --> 03:32:55.275]  On the web at Infowarsteam.com.
[03:32:55.275 --> 03:33:01.576]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[03:33:01.576 --> 03:33:04.417]  They took my saddle in Houston.
[03:33:04.417 --> 03:33:09.558]  Broke my leg in Santa Fe.
[03:33:09.558 --> 03:33:11.879]  Lost my wife and a girlfriend.
[03:33:15.558 --> 03:33:20.502]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[03:33:20.502 --> 03:33:23.724]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:23.724 --> 03:33:30.529]  I'm David Knight and we're going to return to more political intrigue and hypocrisy and lies in just a moment.
[03:33:30.529 --> 03:33:33.191]  But before we do, I want to talk to you about something serious.
[03:33:33.191 --> 03:33:34.172]  Dog sperm.
[03:33:34.172 --> 03:33:35.213]  Yes.
[03:33:35.213 --> 03:33:43.759]  This is a story from the Drudge Report and it actually is quite serious because, you know, the dogs in this case are really kind of like canaries in a coal mine.
[03:33:44.620 --> 03:33:49.323]  Things happen more quickly to dogs and other animals because they have a shorter lifespan.
[03:33:49.323 --> 03:33:54.466]  What this story tells us is something we've been telling you about the food supply for a very long time.
[03:33:54.466 --> 03:34:00.809]  And what they're talking about here, quite frankly, is the sperm quality in dogs has fallen rapidly over the past three decades.
[03:34:00.809 --> 03:34:05.592]  This is a trend, they said, that could help to explain the decline in human fertility.
[03:34:05.592 --> 03:34:09.735]  We're seeing throughout the West, and it's been blamed on sociological issues.
[03:34:09.735 --> 03:34:13.117]  We've seen a lot of people say, well, you know, it's just as we become
[03:34:14.117 --> 03:34:21.521]  More, we have this modern lifestyle and women are interested in their careers and they're delaying childbearing.
[03:34:21.521 --> 03:34:23.822]  And yes, all those things are contributing factors, okay?
[03:34:23.822 --> 03:34:32.046]  But when you look at a situation where throughout the West you're now getting to reproduction rates that are just barely above one.
[03:34:32.046 --> 03:34:36.908]  You have to be over two in order to even maintain your population.
[03:34:36.908 --> 03:34:38.409]  So we see throughout Europe, for example.
[03:34:39.089 --> 03:34:49.098]  The Italians who just a couple of generations ago used to have an average five, six kids or more in their families, all of a sudden that dropped to the lowest in Europe.
[03:34:49.098 --> 03:34:51.140]  So they're just barely over one.
[03:34:51.140 --> 03:34:53.422]  Now it's not strictly sociological.
[03:34:54.042 --> 03:35:09.880]  I believe, and many other people believe, that there are physiological things that are going on that are tied to the kinds of things that we're exposed to in terms of our food, the additives that go into our food, in terms of chemicals that we're exposed to, the environment.
[03:35:09.880 --> 03:35:14.265]  And this is what they're seeing, of course, in the dogs, because it's going to show up in dogs more quickly.
[03:35:14.785 --> 03:35:19.528]  They say they highlighted a potential link between environmental contaminants and fertility.
[03:35:19.528 --> 03:35:26.893]  Scientists discovered chemicals which have a detrimental effect on sperm function and some commercially available pet foods.
[03:35:26.893 --> 03:35:27.353]  Understand.
[03:35:28.470 --> 03:35:31.432]  That it's not significantly different for humans either.
[03:35:31.432 --> 03:35:39.537]  The difference is, they can see these effects more quickly and they can do more tests on the dogs than they're going to do on humans, okay?
[03:35:39.537 --> 03:35:53.427]  They say this is the first time such a decline in male fertility has been reported in the dog and we believe this is due to environmental contaminants, some of which we have detected in dog food and in the sperm and in the testes of the dogs themselves, okay?
[03:35:53.427 --> 03:35:55.208]  This is from the new scientist.
[03:35:55.208 --> 03:35:58.290]  This is one of the reasons that we have the kind of products that we have here, folks.
[03:35:58.750 --> 03:36:03.755]  We're not selling products and then creating a need to sell these products.
[03:36:03.755 --> 03:36:05.296]  There is a need for these products.
[03:36:05.296 --> 03:36:06.797]  That's why Alex has created these.
[03:36:06.797 --> 03:36:18.628]  And so we have products like Super Male Vitality, like Anthroplex that are designed to help you fight these kind of environmental challenges that you have, the kind of estrogen or the hormonal disruptions.
[03:36:18.628 --> 03:36:21.670]  And of course, there are things that disrupt estrogen in women as well.
[03:36:21.670 --> 03:36:23.312]  We have products for that as well.
[03:36:23.312 --> 03:36:25.454]  We have a special right now on Anthroplex
[03:36:25.974 --> 03:36:29.115]  40% off at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:36:29.115 --> 03:36:30.376]  40% off.
[03:36:30.376 --> 03:36:33.097]  That is a huge sale, okay?
[03:36:33.097 --> 03:36:35.558]  Also, we have other sales.
[03:36:35.558 --> 03:36:40.320]  We have Premium Power Pack, 20% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:36:40.320 --> 03:36:44.302]  And I believe we still have InfoWarsStore.com free shipping.
[03:36:44.302 --> 03:36:44.922]  Is that correct, guys?
[03:36:45.222 --> 03:36:46.562]  Yeah, we still have that.
[03:36:46.562 --> 03:36:56.465]  Okay, so everything at the store is free shipping, but also, as you're looking at what's going on in our environment, what's in your food, think about what you need to do to try to combat that.
[03:36:56.465 --> 03:37:05.868]  Of course, you can get cleaner sources of food, and that's very important, but there's so many different ways that you can be exposed to environmental contaminants in food and other chemicals.
[03:37:05.868 --> 03:37:11.269]  Take things that will actually help your system, things like Anthroplex, and it's 40% off at Infowarslife.com.
[03:37:13.490 --> 03:37:19.316]  Now I want to go to some videos that we have of Hillary Clinton and Julian Assange.
[03:37:19.316 --> 03:37:20.557]  There's a back and forth going on.
[03:37:20.557 --> 03:37:24.922]  Of course, Hillary Clinton is just dismissing this stuff as a bunch of conspiracy theories.
[03:37:24.922 --> 03:37:33.651]  But I want to play for you the video that we have of Julian Assange talking about the Russian, supposed Russian connection with Donald Trump.
[03:37:34.341 --> 03:37:39.107]  Any Russian connections between Hillary Clinton and Russia?
[03:37:39.107 --> 03:37:40.649]  Any Russian connections there?
[03:37:40.649 --> 03:37:51.223]  Hillary Clinton has done quite well strategically to try and draw connection between Trump and Russia because she has so many connections of her own.
[03:37:52.044 --> 03:37:59.846]  Now, my analysis of Trump and Russia is that there is no substantial connection.
[03:37:59.846 --> 03:38:01.067]  Why do I say that?
[03:38:01.067 --> 03:38:12.830]  Well, because Trump was trying to invest in Russia before Putin in the 1990s, after Putin, in fact nearly all the way up to the present moment, and he's had no success.
[03:38:12.830 --> 03:38:16.231]  He did not manage to build hotels and so on in Russia, so that shows how
[03:38:19.793 --> 03:38:23.076]  Insubstantial, his contacts are.
[03:38:23.076 --> 03:38:35.186]  There's an extremely well documented pattern of when Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, those people, companies, governments, who wanted a decision by the Secretary of State in their favour,
[03:38:36.124 --> 03:38:44.267]  Making large donations to the Clinton Foundation or in some other cases business deals with the people around Hillary Clinton.
[03:38:44.267 --> 03:39:01.393]  Now one particular instance is the approval by Secretary Clinton of selling 20% of the US uranium reprocessing rights to a Russian company to be exported to Russia.
[03:39:02.515 --> 03:39:09.278]  So at that time, a large donation was made by those Russian interests to the Clinton Foundation.
[03:39:09.278 --> 03:39:16.280]  In addition, Clinton's campaign manager, Podesta, was on the board of a company called Jewel Unlimited.
[03:39:16.280 --> 03:39:25.444]  And Jewel Unlimited held some of these rights and received a $35 million investment from Russia.
[03:39:26.324 --> 03:39:27.544]  That's a Russian government company.
[03:39:27.544 --> 03:39:34.607]  And also Russians were on the board also with Podesta.
[03:39:34.607 --> 03:39:38.888]  So the kind of email revelations from WikiLeaks reveal that Hillary Clinton is a Kremlin stooge?
[03:39:38.888 --> 03:39:50.772]  I wouldn't say Kremlin stooge, but there is a much deeper connection on record with Hillary Clinton and Russia than we are presently aware of with Donald Trump.
[03:39:51.627 --> 03:39:53.328]  I wouldn't say she's a Kremlin stooge either.
[03:39:53.328 --> 03:39:59.712]  I would say she is a corrupt politician who is for sale to anyone for any amount.
[03:39:59.712 --> 03:40:01.012]  Okay?
[03:40:01.012 --> 03:40:03.814]  Remember what he just said there.
[03:40:03.814 --> 03:40:04.674]  20% of U.S.
[03:40:04.674 --> 03:40:07.256]  uranium capacity was sold to the Russians.
[03:40:07.256 --> 03:40:12.879]  And it was a sweetheart deal for Hillary Clinton's close friend and advisor, Podesta.
[03:40:12.879 --> 03:40:13.159]  Okay?
[03:40:13.159 --> 03:40:15.480]  But, of course, there's also connections to Saudi Arabia.
[03:40:15.480 --> 03:40:18.022]  I want to play what Julian Assange said about Saudi Arabia.
[03:40:19.405 --> 03:40:22.846]  What is the connection between Hillary Clinton and Saudi Arabia that certainly got Israel angry?
[03:40:22.846 --> 03:40:24.367]  Well, it's extensive.
[03:40:24.367 --> 03:40:31.369]  I mean, the relationships between Hillary Clinton and Saudi Arabia, between the Clinton Foundation and Saudi Arabia.
[03:40:31.369 --> 03:40:39.692]  Saudi Arabia is probably the largest single donor to the Clinton Foundation.
[03:40:39.692 --> 03:40:43.294]  And you can see
[03:40:45.185 --> 03:40:56.718]  Clinton's arms export policies while she was Secretary of State favoring extensively Saudi Arabia.
[03:40:56.718 --> 03:41:06.388]  Absolutely, and you know there's a story at Breitbart pointing out how Hillary Clinton's State Department rubber stamped visas for a record number of Saudi visitors.
[03:41:07.193 --> 03:41:19.161]  Remember that they gave, they're bragging about the fact that they gave Hillary Clinton 20% of her campaign funds, and we'll get to that in just a moment, and we've talked about that before as well, but it's important to remember this, to put this all in context.
[03:41:19.161 --> 03:41:22.963]  Say despite, this is Breitbart, despite evidence that Saudi Arabian terrorists exploit the U.S.
[03:41:22.963 --> 03:41:32.910]  visa program, and that would be the visa program, the EB-5 visa program that Qazir Khan, or as I like to call him, Sharia Khan, specialized in.
[03:41:33.630 --> 03:41:49.876]  Okay, he's specialized in getting people from Saudi Arabia and some other Arabian countries into this country using that visa program EB-5 which has been flagged by a lot of people in Congress as well as Homeland Security as being a very fraudulent system.
[03:41:49.876 --> 03:41:55.358]  One that is fraught with a lot of security issues but this is what she did for them as Secretary of State.
[03:41:55.358 --> 03:42:02.941]  She doubled the number of visas for Saudi visitors while helping to cut a deal with the kingdom to waive security procedures for Saudi
[03:42:04.441 --> 03:42:06.222]  With their arrival, the U.S.
[03:42:06.222 --> 03:42:07.682]  counter-jihad has learned.
[03:42:07.682 --> 03:42:16.485]  They point out the annual number of non-immigrant visas issued to Saudi nationals soared 93% during her tenure as Secretary of State.
[03:42:16.485 --> 03:42:24.927]  They said that it also would allow Saudi visa holders, this is what Hillary Clinton did, allowed Saudi visa holders to enter the U.S.
[03:42:24.927 --> 03:42:27.468]  as, quote, trusted travelers.
[03:42:28.331 --> 03:42:28.731]  Okay?
[03:42:28.731 --> 03:42:32.834]  They could bypass normal border security processes.
[03:42:32.834 --> 03:42:34.055]  Trusted travelers.
[03:42:34.055 --> 03:42:41.179]  You know, kind of like George Bush trusted the Bin Ladens and flew them out the day after 9-11 on 9-12.
[03:42:41.179 --> 03:42:45.662]  He flew them out even as they were blaming Osama Bin Laden for the 9-11 terrorist attacks.
[03:42:45.662 --> 03:42:47.142]  They fly his family out.
[03:42:47.142 --> 03:42:49.804]  And of course, we've seen the connections in the 28 pages.
[03:42:51.565 --> 03:42:55.209]  We know how closely Saudi intelligence is linked with the CIA.
[03:42:55.209 --> 03:43:01.855]  We know that they are linked with the Federal Reserve, the petrodollar that was created by Nixon and Kissinger.
[03:43:01.855 --> 03:43:04.518]  But to say that they're trusted travelers?
[03:43:04.518 --> 03:43:08.882]  No, really, I think she meant to say they were trust fund travelers.
[03:43:08.882 --> 03:43:13.506]  You know, the people who give her the cash, who provide her with her trust fund.
[03:43:14.227 --> 03:43:21.691]  This story that we've covered before as well, from Zero Hedge, where Saudi Arabia bragged that they'd funded 20% of Hillary's presidential campaign.
[03:43:21.691 --> 03:43:22.672]  Okay?
[03:43:22.672 --> 03:43:28.075]  And understand, this happened at the same time as the Orlando shooting.
[03:43:28.075 --> 03:43:37.180]  So when we look at this Twilight Zone headline that Drudge is featuring at the Drudge Report today, the fact that you would have the father of the Orlando shooter,
[03:43:38.883 --> 03:43:45.970]  At her rally, as Biggs has pointed out, that they would vet him and deliberately put him behind her.
[03:43:45.970 --> 03:43:50.315]  That's not something that just anybody that goes to the rally gets to be behind the candidate.
[03:43:50.315 --> 03:43:53.518]  They would let him go to the rally, put him behind her.
[03:43:55.760 --> 03:44:00.482]  A statement that was made as the Orlando shooting took place.
[03:44:00.482 --> 03:44:10.527]  Hillary Clinton said, it is long past time for the Saudis, for the Qataris, for the Kuwaitis and others to stop their citizens from funding extremist organizations.
[03:44:10.527 --> 03:44:17.111]  And they should stop supporting radical schools and mosques around the world that have set so many young people on a path towards extremism.
[03:44:17.771 --> 03:44:22.759]  Yet she's the one who doubled the number of people coming in from Saudi Arabia.
[03:44:22.759 --> 03:44:25.603]  She's the one who made them trusted travelers.
[03:44:25.603 --> 03:44:25.903]  Okay?
[03:44:25.903 --> 03:44:28.367]  Greasing the skids for these people.
[03:44:28.367 --> 03:44:29.408]  Why?
[03:44:29.408 --> 03:44:31.051]  Because of money.
[03:44:31.051 --> 03:44:31.431]  That's why.
[03:44:32.085 --> 03:44:37.211]  So you've got her doing this and making this speech right as the Orlando shooting is taking place.
[03:44:37.211 --> 03:44:47.782]  You've got her putting Kazir Khan, the guy who supports Sharia law, who has commented on it many times, who has written fawning reviews of
[03:44:48.860 --> 03:44:55.865]  The analyses and the papers about Sharia law that have been done by the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood and others.
[03:44:55.865 --> 03:45:01.730]  She chooses that guy to speak just before she accepts the nomination.
[03:45:01.730 --> 03:45:06.994]  The guy who supports a system of law, and understand this folks, Islam is not just simply religion.
[03:45:07.674 --> 03:45:10.776]  It is a theocracy that they are selling you, okay?
[03:45:10.776 --> 03:45:13.218]  It is a unification of church and state.
[03:45:13.218 --> 03:45:27.408]  These are the Democrats who go to such lengths to say that no expression of Christianity is allowed because we must maintain this extreme separation of church and state, so you're not free to practice your religion if you're a Christian, but if you're a Muslim.
[03:45:27.888 --> 03:45:38.777]  And you want to throw women off the bus and gays under the bus, then you are welcome to introduce Hillary Clinton when you support that kind of Sharia law.
[03:45:38.777 --> 03:45:44.101]  And then she comes out and talks about how dangerous the Saudis are as the Orlando shooting is going on.
[03:45:44.101 --> 03:45:50.407]  But there was a report, and this is one thing that we didn't really talk about in detail off this Zero Hedge article a couple weeks ago.
[03:45:51.502 --> 03:45:57.449]  When this article came out, this information was put out by the Petra News Agency, okay?
[03:45:57.449 --> 03:46:02.235]  And what they had were comments from the Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
[03:46:02.235 --> 03:46:08.223]  It included the claim that Riyadh had provided 20% of the total funding to Hillary's campaign.
[03:46:08.223 --> 03:46:09.564]  Now they deleted that report.
[03:46:11.326 --> 03:46:15.768]  However, we have a screenshot of it, and if you look at that screenshot, it's very important.
[03:46:15.768 --> 03:46:22.712]  They say, the important part of Prince Mohammed bin Salman's statements before traveling to America, this is their summary of it.
[03:46:22.712 --> 03:46:27.795]  This travel is to strengthen extensive economic relations, that kind of boilerplate language, okay?
[03:46:27.795 --> 03:46:32.437]  Our minor differences with America on some issues don't damage our rooted relations with America.
[03:46:32.437 --> 03:46:35.059]  The two countries are strategic allies, so forth and so on.
[03:46:35.419 --> 03:46:39.523]  Saudi kings have always received necessary and sufficient support from the presidents of the United States.
[03:46:39.523 --> 03:46:44.228]  Yeah, like we put them in the catbird seat with the petrodollar, okay?
[03:46:44.228 --> 03:46:49.953]  They agreed to back up our worthless currency and we agreed to do anything for the Saudis.
[03:46:49.953 --> 03:46:52.055]  Then they go on to say this, Saudi Arabia has...
[03:46:52.896 --> 03:46:56.259]  Sponsored both Republican and Democrat Party of America.
[03:46:56.259 --> 03:46:59.682]  In America, current elections also provide with full enthusiasm.
[03:46:59.682 --> 03:47:02.044]  I'm reading this just as they wrote it.
[03:47:02.044 --> 03:47:04.766]  20% of the cost of Hillary Clinton's election.
[03:47:04.766 --> 03:47:05.246]  Hear that?
[03:47:05.246 --> 03:47:07.428]  20% of the cost of Hillary Clinton's election.
[03:47:07.428 --> 03:47:12.732]  Even though some events in the country don't have a positive look to support a woman for presidency.
[03:47:12.732 --> 03:47:17.436]  You know, because the Saudis are all about women in leadership positions.
[03:47:19.239 --> 03:47:35.035]  I covered a report not long ago about how the women in Saudi Arabia went nuts over having one night a week in an amusement park where they could go in and wear regular clothes and not have to dress themselves in a shroud and they could drive
[03:47:35.856 --> 03:47:45.426]  Bumper cars, because they can't get behind the wheel of a car outside of the little bumper car arena on ladies night.
[03:47:45.426 --> 03:47:51.172]  Okay, they could go in there, they could watch movies, they could dress normally, they could even drive a little bumper car.
[03:47:51.172 --> 03:47:58.159]  And they loved that release from a little bit of the pressure put on them by the religious police of Saudi Arabia.
[03:47:58.800 --> 03:48:03.183]  The people who by the way, last year, that's that article, great job guys, you found that.
[03:48:03.183 --> 03:48:05.185]  Look at that, they're dressed in the burkas.
[03:48:05.185 --> 03:48:11.950]  But actually they don't have to dress in the burkas on ladies night, they can take off the burkas when they go around there, that little bit of freedom.
[03:48:11.950 --> 03:48:12.971]  You know, these are the people.
[03:48:14.045 --> 03:48:16.146]  that are supporting Hillary Clinton.
[03:48:16.146 --> 03:48:18.346]  But she says it's just a conspiracy.
[03:48:18.346 --> 03:48:19.907]  Okay?
[03:48:19.907 --> 03:48:21.267]  There's no limit.
[03:48:21.267 --> 03:48:24.508]  The Trump campaign has never met a conspiracy theory it didn't like.
[03:48:24.508 --> 03:48:25.008]  Well, you know what?
[03:48:25.008 --> 03:48:32.510]  If you want to look at a conspiracy theory, again, go back and look at what Barack Obama did with iRansom.
[03:48:32.510 --> 03:48:32.951]  Okay?
[03:48:32.951 --> 03:48:34.091]  Look at that.
[03:48:34.091 --> 03:48:40.873]  Now, as we're looking at some of this other news, while we're on Democrats here, okay?
[03:48:41.840 --> 03:48:45.081]  This is a breaking story that Michael Zimmerman gave me.
[03:48:45.081 --> 03:48:46.122]  Hat tip to Michael.
[03:48:46.122 --> 03:48:55.346]  It says, fresh off of his campaign to make socialism great again, Bernie Sanders buys a $600,000 summer house.
[03:48:55.346 --> 03:48:58.127]  Okay, understand, this is not his primary home.
[03:48:58.127 --> 03:48:59.888]  He's still going to keep his primary home.
[03:48:59.888 --> 03:49:05.170]  This is just a summer home that he just bought now that the campaign is over.
[03:49:05.170 --> 03:49:09.492]  And I look at this and it's like, well, you know, everybody's wondering, you know, what Bernie's price was.
[03:49:09.492 --> 03:49:10.252]  Was he threatened?
[03:49:10.812 --> 03:49:17.760]  By the DNC in order to abandon his lifelong principles of socialism and endorse Hillary Clinton?
[03:49:17.760 --> 03:49:19.502]  Or was he bought off?
[03:49:19.502 --> 03:49:22.165]  You know, did they give him a golden parachute?
[03:49:22.165 --> 03:49:24.908]  Or maybe a Goldman Sachs parachute?
[03:49:24.908 --> 03:49:27.611]  Is that where he came up with the $600,000 to buy a second home?
[03:49:31.115 --> 03:49:31.876]  You know?
[03:49:31.876 --> 03:49:32.978]  There you go, Bernie.
[03:49:32.978 --> 03:49:34.680]  Champagne Wishes and Caviar Dreams.
[03:49:34.680 --> 03:49:41.929]  This is a four-bedroom, 500-foot beachfront on Lake Champlain, okay?
[03:49:41.929 --> 03:49:44.973]  It's on the east side of the island, facing Vermont and not New York.
[03:49:44.973 --> 03:49:46.816]  And when I look at this, okay, this is...
[03:49:47.897 --> 03:49:50.479]  Let me read you some of the tweets these people have.
[03:49:50.479 --> 03:49:57.264]  Man of the people, Bernie Sanders buys a $600,000 second summer home in Vermont.
[03:49:57.264 --> 03:49:57.804]  Another one.
[03:49:57.804 --> 03:50:00.186]  The Socialist now has a summer home.
[03:50:00.186 --> 03:50:00.926]  LOL.
[03:50:00.926 --> 03:50:02.728]  Y'all got clowned as always.
[03:50:02.728 --> 03:50:03.108]  Another one.
[03:50:03.108 --> 03:50:10.753]  When you find out Bernie Sanders just used your $27 donations to buy himself a new summer home.
[03:50:10.753 --> 03:50:12.474]  Look.
[03:50:12.474 --> 03:50:14.036]  He was praising
[03:50:14.844 --> 03:50:16.605]  Daniel Ortega and the Sandinistas.
[03:50:16.605 --> 03:50:19.747]  Remember that 30-year-old video when he went down there?
[03:50:19.747 --> 03:50:21.628]  He just couldn't say enough nice things about them.
[03:50:21.628 --> 03:50:26.150]  But you understand what Daniel Ortega and the Sandinistas did.
[03:50:26.150 --> 03:50:29.131]  I've been calling him this whole campaign Bernie Sandinista, okay?
[03:50:29.131 --> 03:50:34.494]  And actually, I heard some of the Sanders people at the DNC calling themselves Sandinistas.
[03:50:34.494 --> 03:50:35.355]  Daniel Ortega
[03:50:36.175 --> 03:50:37.195]  He was a thief!
[03:50:37.195 --> 03:50:38.496]  He was a kleptocrat!
[03:50:38.496 --> 03:50:48.798]  He stole all the private property from people, and as he was being driven out by a coalition of lefties and righties, he then privatized that again!
[03:50:48.798 --> 03:50:50.058]  For himself!
[03:50:50.058 --> 03:50:52.299]  We saw the same thing happening with Hugo Chavez.
[03:50:52.299 --> 03:50:54.079]  They work for the bankers.
[03:50:54.079 --> 03:50:57.200]  Hugo Chavez gave them 700% return on their investment.
[03:50:57.200 --> 03:50:59.621]  Now we've got Bernie Sanders with a brand new $600,000 home.
[03:50:59.621 --> 03:50:59.921]  Extendivite!
[03:51:01.781 --> 03:51:08.707]  A seven herb combination of garlic, cayenne, hawthorn, bilberry, ginkgo biloba, valerian, and milk thistle.
[03:51:08.707 --> 03:51:14.493]  ExtendoVite is designed to strengthen the heart and arteries and help the body heal itself.
[03:51:14.493 --> 03:51:19.878]  Doctors are not able to explain the improvements they are seeing in their patients' health who are taking ExtendoVite.
[03:51:20.498 --> 03:51:25.221]  People who once needed more pills are now taking less and getting better.
[03:51:25.221 --> 03:51:32.945]  Due to the unexplainable improvements in their patient's health, more doctors are calling to order Extend-A-Vite for themselves.
[03:51:32.945 --> 03:51:35.646]  Help Extend-A-Vite make your doctor a believer.
[03:51:35.646 --> 03:51:41.149]  Extend-A-Vite is available in capsule or liquid form for just $69.95 for a 2 month supply.

[03:51:51.616 --> 03:52:01.424]  Do you ever feel like you're being watched?

[03:52:04.707 --> 03:52:05.528]  I know I do.

[03:54:10.473 --> 03:54:12.695]  Welcome back to our final segment of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:12.695 --> 03:54:13.775]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[03:54:13.775 --> 03:54:20.860]  Before I get back to the news, I just want to remind you that this is the last chance for free shipping storewide at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:54:20.860 --> 03:54:22.861]  It is going to end in the next 24 hours.
[03:54:22.861 --> 03:54:26.443]  We had told you yesterday it was going to go for another 42 hours, and so we're now down to about 24 hours.
[03:54:27.744 --> 03:54:34.389]  But you can still take advantage of this to get some of the off-the-grid preparedness items that we sell at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:54:34.389 --> 03:54:38.552]  Here's a couple of examples and also additional sales that we have.
[03:54:38.552 --> 03:54:44.837]  The premium power pack we have 20% off and of course this is something you can use to even start your car.
[03:54:44.837 --> 03:54:46.538]  I've actually done that myself.
[03:54:46.538 --> 03:54:52.623]  We had a car that we intentionally left the lights on because we're doing some work outside and ran the battery down because it's getting kind of old.
[03:54:53.383 --> 03:54:57.747]  And we're able to easily jump start that with that little tiny box.
[03:54:57.747 --> 03:54:58.608]  It's invaluable.
[03:54:58.608 --> 03:55:01.670]  That's a really handy thing to have available for you.
[03:55:01.670 --> 03:55:10.097]  Especially, you know, if you're a woman and you're concerned about being stranded on the side of the road and how that might expose you to some safety issues.
[03:55:10.097 --> 03:55:14.201]  Just carry that little tiny box with you and you can restart that car.
[03:55:14.201 --> 03:55:19.305]  Also, if you want to get started on solar power, we have the solar base station is now 33% off.
[03:55:20.726 --> 03:55:21.166]  Thank you.
[03:55:30.017 --> 03:55:33.759]  Of course we have this breaking story that I mentioned earlier from Mikhail Thelin.
[03:55:33.759 --> 03:55:39.042]  WikiLeaks is now offering a $20,000 reward for information on a murdered DNC staffer.
[03:55:39.042 --> 03:55:48.546]  There have been three people linked to the DNC who have died under questionable circumstances since these email leaks that affected the DNC.
[03:55:48.546 --> 03:55:51.788]  And of course we've had a lot of people die under questionable circumstances with
[03:55:52.128 --> 03:55:56.390]  Hillary Clinton, Darren McBrain is working on a report right now about it.
[03:55:56.390 --> 03:56:02.433]  There's so many, as a matter of fact, to try to cut it down to the biggest ones is the problem.
[03:56:02.433 --> 03:56:07.855]  And of course, this guy who died, Seth Rich, it was immediately pronounced by the D.C.
[03:56:07.855 --> 03:56:15.439]  police chief, Kathleen Lanier, who never met a gun control law she didn't want to enforce and extend.
[03:56:15.439 --> 03:56:17.540]  She immediately said, well, I think this is a robbery.
[03:56:18.462 --> 03:56:19.963]  They didn't touch his wallet.
[03:56:19.963 --> 03:56:21.483]  They didn't touch his watch.
[03:56:21.483 --> 03:56:23.344]  They didn't take his phone.
[03:56:23.344 --> 03:56:25.144]  Nothing was taken from him.
[03:56:25.144 --> 03:56:26.685]  He was just beaten and shot.
[03:56:26.685 --> 03:56:29.066]  So, WikiLeaks is not buying it.
[03:56:29.066 --> 03:56:33.087]  They're offering a $20,000 reward for information about his murder.
[03:56:34.232 --> 03:56:37.473]  Now, in other news, we have a question by the New American.
[03:56:37.473 --> 03:56:41.794]  They ask, could an increase in gun ownership impact the election?
[03:56:41.794 --> 03:56:43.615]  This is a very interesting way to look at this.
[03:56:43.615 --> 03:56:45.716]  This is a John Lotz organization.
[03:56:45.716 --> 03:56:51.817]  He said, during President Obama's administration, the number of concealed handgun permits has soared to over 14.5 million, a 215% increase since 2007.
[03:56:51.817 --> 03:56:54.058]  More than 6% of the adult population now has a permit to carry concealed.
[03:57:03.601 --> 03:57:08.585]  Do you want to lose that right that you just newly discovered, folks?
[03:57:08.585 --> 03:57:11.908]  Because you will, if Hillary Clinton gets elected.
[03:57:11.908 --> 03:57:21.136]  She will appoint judges all up and down, not just in the Supreme Court, but she'll appoint judges everywhere to do everything she can to shut down your right to keep and bear arms.
[03:57:21.636 --> 03:57:23.898]  And they pointed out this from the Heritage Foundation.
[03:57:23.898 --> 03:57:30.023]  They also noted that the swing states have the biggest increase in the number of permits.
[03:57:30.023 --> 03:57:33.986]  Florida, for example, has 1.6 million, while Pennsylvania has 1.2.
[03:57:33.986 --> 03:57:37.149]  Ohio, Michigan, North Carolina each have more than a half million.
[03:57:37.149 --> 03:57:39.511]  Indiana has nearly three quarters of a million.
[03:57:39.511 --> 03:57:44.715]  These are all states that were carried by Obama in at least one of his last two elections.
[03:57:45.376 --> 03:57:54.446]  But then on the other hand, we have the federal civilian workforce has soared to 2.79 million just recently.
[03:57:54.446 --> 03:57:57.489]  We've had a massive uptick in the bureaucracy.
[03:57:57.489 --> 03:57:59.792]  You know who those people are going to be voting for.
[03:57:59.792 --> 03:58:05.598]  And don't forget, when you look at this, and you look at where we're headed, the disruptive technologies that are coming towards us.
[03:58:06.599 --> 03:58:09.040]  You're worried about the DNC hacks?
[03:58:09.040 --> 03:58:11.621]  Worry about them hacking your transportation.
[03:58:11.621 --> 03:58:26.567]  As I pointed out last night on the Nightly News, these hacks that they're demonstrating at DEF CON and Black Hat Conference, one of them, with just off-the-shelf components, with just a fish depth finder, they could completely blind a Tesla car.
[03:58:26.567 --> 03:58:31.769]  Turn it into, as the guy who said it to me said, turn it into Helen Keller on a NASCAR track.
[03:58:31.769 --> 03:58:34.050]  Join us tonight for the InfoWars Nightly News, 7 Central, 8 p.m.
