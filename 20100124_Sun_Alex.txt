[00:00:02.057 --> 00:00:08.704]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:00:08.704 --> 00:00:14.210]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.972]  Out of the gates, ladies and gentlemen!
[00:00:17.088 --> 00:00:24.753]  Judge Napolitano is our guest, Andrew Napolitano, who really doesn't need any introduction here, but I'll go ahead and give it.
[00:00:24.753 --> 00:00:33.658]  He's the honorable Andrew P. Napolitano, of course, Fox News contributor, Fox News host, and I believe the best person on that popular channel.
[00:00:33.658 --> 00:00:38.882]  I believe he's the only real, bonafide, libertarian, constitutionalist, conservative.
[00:00:39.542 --> 00:00:40.163]  We're working on it, Alex.
[00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.642]  And I mean people know your bio so I won't get into it.
[00:00:58.642 --> 00:01:01.044]  Freedom Watch on Fox as well.
[00:01:01.044 --> 00:01:02.085]  So much is going on.
[00:01:02.085 --> 00:01:04.967]  I want to move quick here with you today.
[00:01:04.967 --> 00:01:09.271]  Last week you openly said that he could be indicted for this.
[00:01:09.271 --> 00:01:10.352]  It surprised me even...
[00:01:11.973 --> 00:01:17.515]  Some of the MSNBC host, like Mr. Schultz, said that the White House is in deep trouble.
[00:01:17.515 --> 00:01:20.315]  Congress is subpoenaing AIG.
[00:01:20.315 --> 00:01:22.716]  Now we learned that they tucked into a bill.
[00:01:22.716 --> 00:01:30.438]  As you know, that much of this is secret till 2018, which again shows evidence of the attempted cover-up.
[00:01:30.438 --> 00:01:40.141]  You have Geithner and others trying to cover up the fact that they transferred money to themselves and of course to former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson.
[00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:40.761]  This is huge.
[00:01:42.213 --> 00:01:58.438]  You know, we don't exactly know what Geithner himself personally knew, but there's a couple of things that we do know, and I have read the emails that were released by Congressman Darrell Issa, who obtained them in his capacity as an American under the Freedom of Information Act.
[00:01:58.438 --> 00:02:01.419]  He didn't use any particular government authority to get them.
[00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:07.881]  And the emails are between and among lawyers for the New York Fed, lawyers for the Treasury Department,
[00:02:08.413 --> 00:02:16.996]  Lawyers for AIG and lawyers for JPMorgan Chase, which was the intermediary bank that the Fed was using through which to funnel its money.
[00:02:16.996 --> 00:02:32.560]  And basically, it is an instruction from the government to AIG, which was about to receive $185 billion, some from the government and some from the Federal Reserve, the largest single bailout by a government in the history of the world.
[00:02:34.665 --> 00:02:51.389]  And it was an instruction to AIG that in its applications for this money, it not list truthfully the identity of all of its creditors, and it especially not list its intention to pay some of those creditors 100 cents of a dollar.
[00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:59.051]  We now know that the principal creditor that the Fed lawyers wanted to keep from public awareness was Goldman Sachs.
[00:02:59.051 --> 00:03:03.432]  And of course, at the time, the Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, was the recently retired
[00:03:03.931 --> 00:03:14.540]  Chair of Goldman Sachs, we know now that AIG owed Goldman Sachs $13 billion that it planned to pay 100 cents of the dollar and that in fact it did.
[00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.763]  So question, what did Tim Geithner know and when did he know it?
[00:03:18.763 --> 00:03:33.255]  Well, he was the President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at the time his in-house lawyers were telling AIG to hide from the SEC the existence of the debt
[00:03:33.795 --> 00:03:35.297]  ...to Goldman Sachs.
[00:03:35.297 --> 00:03:36.618]  Now, a little bit of basic law.
[00:03:36.618 --> 00:03:42.683]  You go to buy a $100 savings bond, and you give the wrong zip code, no problem.
[00:03:42.683 --> 00:03:49.669]  But if you intentionally give the wrong address, you falsify the federal document, and you can be prosecuted.
[00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:58.317]  Can you imagine what the law would say about falsifying a document, not for a $100 savings bond, but for a $185 billion bailout of taxpayer dollars?
[00:04:01.261 --> 00:04:05.603]  That is what is confronting Tim Geithner.
[00:04:05.603 --> 00:04:18.590]  Now, clearly he's the head of the New York Fed at the time, working with his former boss, the former head of Goldman Sachs, who was the Treasury Secretary in the fall and winter of 2008, Henry Paulson, and we have
[00:04:20.771 --> 00:04:42.486]  Paulson, we have Geithner, we have Bernanke, all in countless House and Senate Banking Committee meetings, repeating what's in the emails, saying, we won't tell you who got the money, we won't tell you, telling Congress, who under the Constitution, as you know, but for some of the audience, has full control over the issuance of currency and credit and the banks.
[00:04:42.486 --> 00:04:45.288]  And so, for him to now say, oh, as the head of the Fed,
[00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:56.243]  I had no idea what was going on with a $185 billion payout to my own former company and to the current Treasury Secretary of 2008.
[00:04:56.243 --> 00:04:57.946]  I mean, this is asinine.
[00:05:01.138 --> 00:05:04.160]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.485]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:05:09.485 --> 00:05:11.526]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:05:11.526 --> 00:05:16.530]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:17.451]  How much do you want?
[00:05:17.711 --> 00:05:18.832]  When do you want it?
[00:05:18.832 --> 00:05:20.713]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:05:20.713 --> 00:05:21.794]  When will you need it?
[00:05:21.794 --> 00:05:23.995]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:05:23.995 --> 00:05:25.336]  Will there be any food?
[00:05:25.336 --> 00:05:26.857]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:05:26.857 --> 00:05:32.140]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.723]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:05:35.723 --> 00:05:39.185]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:05:39.525 --> 00:05:40.745]  How much will you need?
[00:05:40.745 --> 00:05:41.666]  We don't know.
[00:05:41.666 --> 00:05:42.746]  How much do you want?
[00:05:42.746 --> 00:05:43.686]  All you can get.
[00:05:43.686 --> 00:05:44.787]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:44.787 --> 00:05:47.828]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:05:47.828 --> 00:05:49.608]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:05:49.608 --> 00:05:50.528]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:06:01.696 --> 00:06:08.320]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.823]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:06:11.823 --> 00:06:13.904]  Now Judge, isn't it an oxymoron to have
[00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:35.328]  Geithner and the rest of the crew who are in this revolving door sharing powers with each other in the private corporate banks and then in government clearly stating our official policy is who gets these trillions of dollars that have been served out 180 plus billion to themselves
[00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:57.090]  They're official policy before Congress in the last two years is that it's all secret and then now they say oh my goodness this is terrible we don't know who did this we're not involved in these emails making it secret I mean that right there when they have articulated that their policy is to make it secret and then to now say that that
[00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:01.093]  I mean, it just insults rational thought.
[00:07:01.093 --> 00:07:05.036]  Clearly they're engaged in a cover-up, and the SEC is clearly involved.
[00:07:05.036 --> 00:07:13.142]  I mean, here's Kurt Nemo's Infowars.com headline from yesterday, SEC engages in conspiracy with AIG to hide bailout evidence.
[00:07:13.142 --> 00:07:17.965]  We've got a top judge here saying that that's exactly what he thinks is going on.
[00:07:17.965 --> 00:07:19.627]  Where do we go from here?
[00:07:19.627 --> 00:07:22.449]  I mean, the emperor has no clothes.
[00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:23.750]  This is a joke.
[00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.472]  Well, we go to places like your show.
[00:07:27.082 --> 00:07:39.148]  Because of your zeal and your courage and your fearlessness in exposing this, much as you exercise the same zeal and courage and fearlessness in the previous administration.
[00:07:39.148 --> 00:07:40.429]  And we have to educate people.
[00:07:40.429 --> 00:07:45.151]  But Alex, I feel it resonating now.
[00:07:45.151 --> 00:07:50.454]  When Bush was doing these things, I frequently felt that my words, and sometimes yours,
[00:07:50.990 --> 00:08:00.982]  We're falling on deaf ears other than those who, before all this happened, had an appreciation for human liberty and limited government and the primacy of the individual.
[00:08:00.982 --> 00:08:05.989]  But I see that as a prairie fire spreading around the country now.
[00:08:05.989 --> 00:08:06.950]  I mean, just think of it.
[00:08:07.358 --> 00:08:17.767]  The Democrats in Massachusetts are within a weekend of losing a seat that they claimed was the personal property of the Kennedy family to a Republican.
[00:08:17.767 --> 00:08:20.489]  He's not your kind of Republican or my kind of Republican.
[00:08:20.489 --> 00:08:22.210]  There's a mass exodus.
[00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:28.555]  The Democratic Party is imploding because they're... I mean, Bush, we thought Bush was bad because he tripled government.
[00:08:28.555 --> 00:08:34.080]  Obama, as you know, officially spent more money than all presidents before him combined, back to George Washington.
[00:08:34.838 --> 00:08:37.759]  And he has only been in office a year.
[00:08:37.759 --> 00:08:38.639]  You're right.
[00:08:38.639 --> 00:08:39.339]  You're right.
[00:08:39.339 --> 00:08:49.481]  And I think that the Democrats know that they will soon lose their filibuster-proof Senate, and they may actually lose the House altogether in November.
[00:08:49.481 --> 00:08:57.323]  So they know that if they want to do what FDR did to us in 12 years, they only have 10 months left in which to do it.
[00:08:57.323 --> 00:09:00.824]  And the next 10 months will be a mad dash to see how much
[00:09:01.324 --> 00:09:06.429]  Unconstitutional legislation that regulates private human behavior.
[00:09:06.429 --> 00:09:10.833]  They can weave into federal law but they are beginning to feel the blowback already.
[00:09:10.833 --> 00:09:11.814]  Prediction.
[00:09:11.814 --> 00:09:14.777]  If this young man, moderate Republican that he is,
[00:09:15.393 --> 00:09:18.034]  Well I don't know who has jumped ship yet from the Democrats, I'd love to hear it.
[00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:43.792]  Well, at the state level, we're seeing all sorts of state senators and legislative people.
[00:09:43.792 --> 00:09:47.113]  We've seen one in the House, one Democrat, say they're shifting over to... Right.
[00:09:47.113 --> 00:09:53.894]  By the way, I learned this morning that the most liberal member of the House of Representatives, Bob Wexler from Florida, resigned.
[00:09:53.894 --> 00:09:57.875]  And there's no mechanism to replace him in time for the vote on health care.
[00:09:57.875 --> 00:10:06.057]  Now, health care in the House passed by three votes, so Mrs. Pelosi now has two votes with which to play.
[00:10:06.057 --> 00:10:06.937]  That's the extent of her
[00:10:07.577 --> 00:10:09.418]  Wow, that is huge news.
[00:10:09.418 --> 00:10:19.183]  So to be clear, when Senator Dodd says that it's hanging by a thread in conference committee, the government grab of health care, it really is hanging by a thread.
[00:10:19.183 --> 00:10:20.003]  Oh, it absolutely is.
[00:10:20.003 --> 00:10:23.705]  There's a congressman whose name is escaping me, a member of the African American
[00:10:24.235 --> 00:10:32.739]  Leadership in the House of Democrats for Missouri was once the mayor of Kansas City, who said this morning that it truly is in danger.
[00:10:32.739 --> 00:10:38.501]  He predicts eventually something will pass, but he doesn't think it'll be either the House version or the Senate version.
[00:10:38.501 --> 00:10:42.523]  Here's a member of the Democratic leadership who predicted they'd go back to square one.
[00:10:42.523 --> 00:10:43.183]  Why?
[00:10:43.183 --> 00:10:53.127]  Because they did it behind the scenes, because they didn't care about natural rights, they didn't care about the free market, they didn't care about American values, they didn't care about the Constitution, and they're trying to shove it down our throats.
[00:10:53.735 --> 00:11:00.078]  And I think the biggest issue here is liberals finally read the bill and found out, wait, we're not getting a free lunch.
[00:11:00.078 --> 00:11:03.540]  They raise our taxes and cut our goodies.
[00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:06.281]  This is a big bailout to insurance companies.
[00:11:06.281 --> 00:11:07.382]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:11:07.382 --> 00:11:11.324]  And I am delighted to hear the liberals scream.
[00:11:12.082 --> 00:11:19.204]  That they and their states will be paying more money because Nebraska doesn't have to pay for Medicaid and Medicare.
[00:11:19.204 --> 00:11:29.726]  The liberals, and some conservatives have done this too, have been bribing their own members of Congress for generations in order to secure their votes.
[00:11:29.726 --> 00:11:35.868]  But when they are not the recipient of the bribe, but the payer of it, oh how you can hear them squeal.
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:53.351]  Judge, I want to get you up for a full hour in the near future to talk about your latest book, all the work you're doing, because you really are trailblazing at Fox News, and I see them more and more aligning themselves with you and your constitutionalist view.
[00:11:53.351 --> 00:12:04.639]  But in the six, seven minutes we've got left, moving quickly, specifically with your constitutional law background, a constitutional law lawyer and judge, specifically,
[00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:09.481]  You could call the shots.
[00:12:09.481 --> 00:12:14.362]  Right now, how do we force Bankstergate out into the open?
[00:12:14.362 --> 00:12:16.922]  I mean, it's already blowing up in their face.
[00:12:16.922 --> 00:12:28.625]  How do we ensure that we mortally wound the private Federal Reserve banking cartel and reveal to the world that this is an unconstitutional, larcenous enterprise?
[00:12:28.625 --> 00:12:34.966]  Because this patina, this cloak of invincibility has now fallen away from them.
[00:12:36.047 --> 00:12:37.710]  Your take on that?
[00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:43.640]  Well, there's a couple things going on, and they're both positive in our direction.
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:47.727]  There is litigation making its way through the courts, which in my view will grant
[00:12:48.342 --> 00:13:00.370]  To Bloomberg News and to Fox News, under the Freedom of Information Act, documents that the Federal Reserve has been fighting aggressively to keep secret with respect to TARP.
[00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:07.315]  Now, we may not get these documents until after the election of 2010, but once we do get them, it'll be a treasure trove.
[00:13:07.315 --> 00:13:13.799]  There is also legislation making its way through Congress, which is Congressman Ron Paul's legislation.
[00:13:14.229 --> 00:13:15.130]  To audit the Fed.
[00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:23.538]  Now, unfortunately, it has been attached to other legislation, which is utterly hateful to those of us who believe in the free market and limited government.
[00:13:23.538 --> 00:13:32.366]  But, by attaching it to that legislation, the President cannot veto it, because he desperately wants the other legislation with it.
[00:13:32.366 --> 00:13:33.827]  It's a sleeper.
[00:13:33.827 --> 00:13:39.052]  If it becomes law, and if there is a true audit of the Fed, as it does call for,
[00:13:39.844 --> 00:13:46.187]  It will expose this monster from Jekyll Island for all of the horrific things it's done.
[00:13:46.187 --> 00:13:56.211]  The secret foreign policy that it runs, the monsters that it's been bailing out, the people that have been making money, the inflation, the secret tax that it's imposed on all of us.
[00:13:56.211 --> 00:14:03.955]  We will finally have in front of the American people in black and white the who, what, when, where, and how that they did this to us.
[00:14:04.855 --> 00:14:08.318]  So the momentum is shifting in the direction of liberty.
[00:14:08.318 --> 00:14:09.459]  Everybody can feel it.
[00:14:09.459 --> 00:14:11.021]  You are seeing it.
[00:14:11.021 --> 00:14:11.762]  Is that what you're saying?
[00:14:11.762 --> 00:14:13.503]  Yeah, but you know, it's an odd momentum.
[00:14:13.503 --> 00:14:16.466]  I'll give you an example.
[00:14:16.466 --> 00:14:27.056]  The chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, the bombastic and colorful Barney Franke, quintessential liberal Democrat who believes in Soviet-style central planning.
[00:14:27.828 --> 00:14:31.910]  is now a co-sponsor of Ron Paul's Audit the Fed.
[00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:46.378]  So, at the same time he will help that part of the bill to pass the Audit the Fed, he will also usher through more power to the Fed to regulate the economy.
[00:14:46.378 --> 00:14:56.424]  So, in some narrow ways I see blossoms of liberty in the land, but in other ways I see the most heavy-handed government
[00:14:56.815 --> 00:15:08.224]  We have ever known, and it's almost a question of holding our breath until the Democrats lose the filibuster-proof majority in the Senate and perhaps the majority in the House just ten months from now.
[00:15:08.224 --> 00:15:18.432]  And the bigger question is, will we see a repeat of Gingrich, the establishment globalist, coming in, taking control of the new Republicans, and making sure they don't deliver to the people?
[00:15:18.652 --> 00:15:24.518]  Because if Republicans actually delivered liberty and freedom, they would be in power for 50 years, we'd save the country.
[00:15:24.518 --> 00:15:26.600]  But no, they're going to want to launch more wars.
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:30.204]  They're going to want to make money off the naked body scanners like Chertoff.
[00:15:30.204 --> 00:15:38.973]  And if Republicans, as they get into power in the next three years, in the next two elections, if they don't deliver on liberty, what comes next?
[00:15:41.112 --> 00:15:58.035]  I don't know what will come next, but in the six years that the Republicans controlled the White House and the Congress, which would be George W. Bush's first term, and the first two years of his second term, I think there was less fidelity to the Constitution.
[00:16:00.353 --> 00:16:07.335]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:16:07.335 --> 00:16:08.615]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:16:08.615 --> 00:16:09.416]  It's very real.
[00:16:09.416 --> 00:16:11.656]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:16:11.656 --> 00:16:13.317]  And it's available right now to you.
[00:16:13.317 --> 00:16:17.798]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[00:17:00.199 --> 00:17:04.742]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:17:04.742 --> 00:17:05.662]  Number one.
[00:17:05.662 --> 00:17:09.085]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:17:09.085 --> 00:17:09.945]  Number two.
[00:17:09.945 --> 00:17:14.848]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:17:14.848 --> 00:17:15.589]  It's true.
[00:17:15.589 --> 00:17:20.452]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:17:20.452 --> 00:17:20.992]  Number three.
[00:17:21.272 --> 00:17:24.855]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:17:24.855 --> 00:17:29.579]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:17:29.579 --> 00:17:32.341]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:17:32.341 --> 00:17:36.805]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:17:36.805 --> 00:17:40.949]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:17:40.949 --> 00:17:45.713]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:17:45.993 --> 00:17:50.175]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:17:50.175 --> 00:17:51.956]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:17:51.956 --> 00:17:54.198]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:17:54.198 --> 00:17:56.559]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:18:01.923 --> 00:18:05.884]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:18:05.884 --> 00:18:14.745]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:18:14.745 --> 00:18:19.366]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:18:19.366 --> 00:18:30.188]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:18:30.828 --> 00:18:40.330]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:45.772]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:18:45.772 --> 00:18:53.253]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:18:53.253 --> 00:18:56.014]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:19:01.218 --> 00:19:05.242]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:19:05.242 --> 00:19:08.466]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:19:08.466 --> 00:19:13.291]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:19:13.291 --> 00:19:19.678]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:19:19.678 --> 00:19:21.921]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:19:22.421 --> 00:19:22.741]  Tim Geithner?
[00:19:22.741 --> 00:19:23.261]  Bernanke?
[00:19:23.261 --> 00:19:24.062]  They're arsonists!
[00:19:24.062 --> 00:19:25.202]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:19:25.202 --> 00:19:27.443]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:19:41.348 --> 00:19:43.469]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:19:43.469 --> 00:19:48.610]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:19:48.610 --> 00:20:01.273]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:20:01.273 --> 00:20:04.874]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[00:20:04.874 --> 00:20:08.075]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:20:10.945 --> 00:20:13.714]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:20:13.714 --> 00:20:16.522]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:20:36.339 --> 00:20:41.649]  Well, his new book's been out for months, been at the top of the bestseller charts in the Fed.
[00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:53.338]  And of course, he had a number one New York Times bestseller, his Manifesto of Freedom, and you can find out a lot more at Campaign for Liberty.
[00:20:53.338 --> 00:21:04.786]  Ron Paul, again, is our statesman, our champion out there, really exposing the fake Republican Party and the fake Democratic Party.
[00:21:04.786 --> 00:21:11.772]  Congressman, getting back to healthcare here briefly, a month ago on the show, you said it looks like it probably will pass.
[00:21:12.592 --> 00:21:15.073]  Is that still your prognosis?
[00:21:15.073 --> 00:21:18.875]  Yes, but I don't think anybody knows what will be in it.
[00:21:18.875 --> 00:21:21.977]  I don't think it will be everything that Obama wanted.
[00:21:24.821 --> 00:21:31.709]  I wouldn't put a whole lot of money on exactly what's going to happen, because, you know, the right-to-life people in the House are very, very determined.
[00:21:31.709 --> 00:21:37.917]  And Democrats, you know, Bart Stupak says he's going to stick to his guns, so maybe something good will come of all that.
[00:21:37.917 --> 00:21:41.160]  But then again, I think something will pass.
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.984]  The government is going to get more control of medical care.
[00:21:47.119 --> 00:21:53.508]  In every poll, you get Gallup polls of 99% against the banker bailout takeover of 2008.
[00:21:53.508 --> 00:21:55.650]  You see 91% against open borders.
[00:21:55.650 --> 00:22:00.096]  You see 70-plus percent not wanting government-financed abortion.
[00:22:00.096 --> 00:22:01.899]  But it all just continues.
[00:22:02.419 --> 00:22:04.961]  Even if the people are against it.
[00:22:04.961 --> 00:22:06.662]  Take Copenhagen.
[00:22:06.662 --> 00:22:16.648]  The Copenhagen-Denmark event, Congressman, as you know, they couldn't get the treaty, so Obama and Gordon Brown say they're just going to implement it at the executive level.
[00:22:16.648 --> 00:22:18.629]  Is this not tyranny?
[00:22:18.629 --> 00:22:22.132]  It is, and they do a lot of that, and they've been doing it for a lot of years.
[00:22:22.132 --> 00:22:26.995]  Executive orders, probably about 99% of those are illegal.
[00:22:26.995 --> 00:22:30.437]  There are some conditions where a president's allowed to issue an executive order.
[00:22:31.127 --> 00:22:39.070]  But you have the executive orders, you have the signing statements, and I mentioned before about how agencies of government legislate.
[00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:41.010]  That's unconstitutional.
[00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:43.591]  And it's just growing by leaps and bounds.
[00:22:43.591 --> 00:22:51.074]  And when you think about what the CIA does and how we run our foreign policy, it's all out of control.
[00:22:52.759 --> 00:22:56.883]  And it seems from studying history that that's what tyrannies do.
[00:22:56.883 --> 00:23:00.387]  They just get you trained to accept corruption.
[00:23:00.387 --> 00:23:03.029]  No one is for it, but they just do it.
[00:23:03.029 --> 00:23:07.834]  And the people kind of get a broken mindset or broken attitude.
[00:23:09.095 --> 00:23:13.460]  I've seen polls in Europe of 76% against the naked body scanners.
[00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:18.406]  We have medical reports that it does bombard your body with dangerous radiation.
[00:23:18.406 --> 00:23:22.070]  The media blurs the images, but we've posted and gotten the real images.
[00:23:23.872 --> 00:23:27.394]  Images of women's breasts, genitalia, men's genitals.
[00:23:27.394 --> 00:23:30.895]  This is a literal recording of your naked body.
[00:23:30.895 --> 00:23:36.538]  England has to change their law, The Guardian reports, because it is child pornography under their laws.
[00:23:36.538 --> 00:23:41.240]  I mean, who would imagine Stalin putting people through naked body scanners?
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:44.301]  Congressman, can you speak to that A and B?
[00:23:44.301 --> 00:23:49.884]  Could you sponsor a bill to have Congress get control of the TSA?
[00:23:50.624 --> 00:23:57.390]  And not let them put in these machines and we have Chertoff making money off the company that got the government contracts?
[00:23:57.390 --> 00:24:00.132]  I mean, this is just incredible conflicts of interest.
[00:24:00.132 --> 00:24:06.137]  We've already had a vote in the House on this to ban these scanners and they passed it to the House.
[00:24:06.137 --> 00:24:09.380]  So that represented what the people were saying.
[00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:10.561]  That was several months ago.
[00:24:11.201 --> 00:24:14.325]  But it's almost like this is the reaction to it.
[00:24:14.325 --> 00:24:19.432]  We need to prove that we need these machines and they have this incident come up.
[00:24:19.432 --> 00:24:26.782]  So I think the people back then said one thing, but now they're using the tactic.
[00:24:26.782 --> 00:24:29.145]  You were wondering why do the people
[00:24:29.765 --> 00:24:39.554]  Uh, you know, go along, and even though it seems like they're opposed to it, I think the reason that people finally go along, even though their numbers are against it, is because of fear.
[00:24:39.554 --> 00:24:44.258]  I mean, the government knows how to build up fear, you know, fear of the financial collapse of the system.
[00:24:44.258 --> 00:24:46.000]  Oh yeah, that's why we have to bail everybody out.
[00:24:46.941 --> 00:24:54.826]  The fear that Osama Bin Laden is on the verge of having a nuclear weapon and Saddam Hussein is going to bomb Washington, D.C.
[00:24:54.826 --> 00:25:05.192]  is always fear, fear, fear, and then the people get frightened, and then they sacrifice their liberties, and it's a continuous process.
[00:25:05.192 --> 00:25:09.194]  It's a hard thing to combat, but hopefully we'll be able to do it.
[00:25:09.858 --> 00:25:12.279]  So, carbon dioxide is going to kill us.
[00:25:12.279 --> 00:25:15.920]  We've got to have a world government and a world tax to save us.
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:17.460]  The swine flu is going to kill us.
[00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:23.842]  It's killed right around 11% so far, according to the Associated Press, what the regular seasonal flu does.
[00:25:23.842 --> 00:25:27.643]  But we've got to have those forced inoculations in New York and Massachusetts.
[00:25:27.643 --> 00:25:28.763]  That failed.
[00:25:28.763 --> 00:25:36.145]  It does seem that their selling of fear, though, is having less and less effect, and that people are starting to get wise to it.
[00:25:36.405 --> 00:25:37.245]  Yeah, this is it.
[00:25:37.245 --> 00:25:40.926]  And this is the great thing that's happened, is the loss of credibility of government.
[00:25:40.926 --> 00:25:52.230]  And this comes along with the acknowledgement that the government is bankrupt, and that both parties are bankrupt, because governments make promises and they can't fulfill them.
[00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:57.952]  Even these foreign policy adventures, adventurism, that's not going to pan out either.
[00:25:57.952 --> 00:25:59.712]  There will be a point where you can't afford it.
[00:25:59.712 --> 00:26:00.913]  That's why the Soviets left.
[00:26:00.913 --> 00:26:02.393]  It isn't because we fought them.
[00:26:02.393 --> 00:26:04.694]  They finally, the economic system couldn't be sustained.
[00:26:05.354 --> 00:26:15.038]  And there's as much concern on the left as there is on the right about government and its credibility, because the people on the left say, hey, maybe my benefits aren't going to come.
[00:26:15.038 --> 00:26:17.680]  Is it true that Social Security is bankrupt?
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:21.081]  And where are they going to get this money for all this medical bill?
[00:26:21.081 --> 00:26:26.243]  You know, eventually they're starting to wake up, because government is losing their credibility.
[00:26:26.243 --> 00:26:28.585]  And I think this is very, very healthy.
[00:26:28.585 --> 00:26:33.827]  But our job is not just to harp on their total failure as much as to say,
[00:26:34.247 --> 00:26:35.368]  What are we going to do about it?
[00:26:35.368 --> 00:26:36.928]  Is there an answer to this?
[00:26:36.928 --> 00:26:44.432]  This is where, when I talk on college campuses, they're delighted to hear that there are alternatives, there are things to do.
[00:26:44.432 --> 00:26:55.437]  And I am convinced in my own mind that if we had truly a free society and found money and limited government and sensible foreign policy, and we just got out of the way, and everybody got
[00:26:56.209 --> 00:27:00.732]  You know, lost 75% of their wealth tomorrow, but they were left alone.
[00:27:00.732 --> 00:27:05.396]  I think we'd recover quickly, quicker than anybody would ever dream of.
[00:27:05.396 --> 00:27:15.243]  So the whole issue is how free we can be and whether we can have self-reliance and take care of ourselves and push us back to depending on local communities and family.
[00:27:15.243 --> 00:27:22.208]  It is so remarkable how successful that is, but unfortunately our country has lost confidence in that.
[00:27:22.768 --> 00:27:27.790]  But now the question is being asked, if government can't deliver, what is the option?
[00:27:27.790 --> 00:27:33.773]  Too often, though, they're saying, you know, the people that you fight all the time are the one-world people.
[00:27:33.773 --> 00:27:36.454]  And you say, oh yes, there is a crisis, a financial crisis.
[00:27:36.454 --> 00:27:42.776]  That means we need a single central bank for the whole world.
[00:27:42.776 --> 00:27:51.560]  But the other option is maybe introducing the notion of gold and silver coinage here in the United States, like the Constitution mandates.
[00:27:53.123 --> 00:27:59.892]  Congressman, a few minutes ago you alluded to the fact that they couldn't get their multi-billion dollar airport scanners in.
[00:27:59.892 --> 00:28:02.415]  People were refusing en masse.
[00:28:02.415 --> 00:28:06.820]  And so magically, Christmas Day, I heard on the radio about the underwear bomber.
[00:28:08.131 --> 00:28:09.352]  And then I talked to eyewitnesses.
[00:28:09.352 --> 00:28:10.613]  They didn't hear an explosion.
[00:28:10.613 --> 00:28:12.815]  They saw another man on board the flight.
[00:28:12.815 --> 00:28:18.299]  They saw a man lead the underwear bomber onto the flight in Amsterdam.
[00:28:18.299 --> 00:28:20.741]  They had body scanners in Amsterdam.
[00:28:20.741 --> 00:28:22.582]  He bypassed security.
[00:28:22.582 --> 00:28:28.826]  The underwear bomber's father said he was training in Yemen, but he wasn't put on the watch list.
[00:28:28.826 --> 00:28:29.887]  On and on and on.
[00:28:29.887 --> 00:28:31.769]  And you talk about...
[00:28:32.629 --> 00:28:36.492]  Letting this happen, or how convenient that this came along.
[00:28:36.492 --> 00:28:46.340]  Even Rush Limbaugh now admits there's a global government forming, and he admits that the government wants to wreck society so that we all become dependent on them.
[00:29:00.652 --> 00:29:05.957]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[00:29:05.957 --> 00:29:08.700]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:14.045]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[00:29:14.045 --> 00:29:16.808]  Friends, I hope that you will order shadow government.
[00:29:17.048 --> 00:29:18.509]  From Infowars.com.
[00:29:18.509 --> 00:29:19.949]  We also have some specials for you.
[00:29:19.949 --> 00:29:23.531]  Some of our other films have price when you order Shadow Government.
[00:29:23.531 --> 00:29:34.676]  A new level in production quality and in information exposes how a cashless society, surveillance beast grid of total control is being put into place.
[00:29:34.676 --> 00:29:36.517]  This film needs to be seen.

[00:30:01.141 --> 00:30:04.143]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:30:04.143 --> 00:30:09.468]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:30:09.468 --> 00:30:11.529]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:30:11.529 --> 00:30:16.533]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:30:16.533 --> 00:30:17.434]  How much do you want?
[00:30:17.694 --> 00:30:18.815]  When do you want it?
[00:30:18.815 --> 00:30:20.696]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:30:20.696 --> 00:30:21.777]  When will you need it?
[00:30:21.777 --> 00:30:23.978]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:30:23.978 --> 00:30:25.319]  Will there be any food?
[00:30:25.319 --> 00:30:26.840]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:32.123]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:30:32.123 --> 00:30:35.706]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:30:35.706 --> 00:30:39.168]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:30:39.508 --> 00:30:40.750]  How much will you need?
[00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:41.651]  We don't know.
[00:30:41.651 --> 00:30:42.752]  How much do you want?
[00:30:42.752 --> 00:30:43.673]  All you can get.
[00:30:43.673 --> 00:30:44.774]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:44.774 --> 00:30:47.818]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[00:33:01.443 --> 00:33:02.963]  Coast to Coast.
[00:33:02.963 --> 00:33:05.024]  Direct from Austin.
[00:33:05.024 --> 00:33:08.246]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:33:15.051 --> 00:33:26.506]  You know, on the airplanes, if the airlines were responsible, there is technology available now that every individual could be issued something no bigger than a cell phone and it would be your identification badge.
[00:33:27.426 --> 00:33:31.088]  The airline can have that registered.
[00:33:31.088 --> 00:33:36.712]  So they say, oh, I know your little gadget there belongs to Ron Paul, so I want you to put your fingerprint on it.
[00:33:36.712 --> 00:33:39.574]  You put your fingerprint on it, and they get the recording.
[00:33:39.574 --> 00:33:42.436]  They have no record of your fingerprint, no records kept.
[00:33:42.436 --> 00:33:44.497]  The government doesn't know anything about it.
[00:33:44.497 --> 00:33:47.399]  But I'm a frequent flyer, but I have my passport.
[00:33:47.399 --> 00:33:51.861]  You know, I have a card, which I have voluntarily gotten.
[00:33:51.861 --> 00:33:53.242]  It's a corporate passport!
[00:33:54.824 --> 00:33:57.847]  Turn that ID badge on, and that technology is available.
[00:33:57.847 --> 00:34:01.010]  I mean, that at least would take care of 90%.
[00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:04.715]  Even if you didn't fly a whole lot, you could get pre-screened for this.
[00:34:04.715 --> 00:34:06.997]  That's what I would do if I was running the airlines.
[00:34:06.997 --> 00:34:10.321]  I wouldn't say, oh anybody, come on, you know, I'd be very careful.
[00:34:10.461 --> 00:34:13.542]  But Congressman, we know what's really happening.
[00:34:13.542 --> 00:34:15.423]  Take Austin, Texas.
[00:34:15.423 --> 00:34:21.947]  $150 million spent on Capital Metro that 1% of the city rides at a cost over $35 per ride.
[00:34:21.947 --> 00:34:23.287]  The person pays $2.
[00:34:23.287 --> 00:34:25.788]  And $70 million is spent on Austin Roads.
[00:34:25.788 --> 00:34:36.654]  So more than double the money is spent because the government gets to control the buses than what all the rest of the people are using cars.
[00:34:36.654 --> 00:34:37.374]  They only get
[00:34:38.914 --> 00:34:41.855]  Half of the money or less of their own tax money.
[00:34:41.855 --> 00:34:44.035]  And it's the same thing with big government.
[00:34:44.035 --> 00:34:47.356]  Big government with revolving doors, with Homeland Security people.
[00:34:47.356 --> 00:34:49.517]  They're all making money as consultants.
[00:34:49.517 --> 00:34:53.458]  They recommend the body scanners and the surveillance, and then they make money off of it.
[00:34:53.458 --> 00:34:54.898]  It's criminal!
[00:34:54.898 --> 00:34:56.119]  Yeah, there's no doubt about it.
[00:34:56.119 --> 00:34:58.820]  When I heard that thing about Chernoff, it's hard to believe.
[00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:00.180]  Somebody was interviewing him, like,
[00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:06.443]  Oh, by the way, I know you run this, and how did you guys know that this was so important?
[00:35:06.443 --> 00:35:09.584]  It was like, he was really smart that he figured this out.
[00:35:09.584 --> 00:35:13.346]  It wasn't like, is there a conflict of interest?
[00:35:13.346 --> 00:35:16.287]  That question never even came up when he was being interviewed.
[00:35:16.287 --> 00:35:22.750]  Well, that's like in Congress, whenever Paulson had the Treasury, they'd say, well, you got tens of millions of dollars of your own bailout money.
[00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:25.291]  He'd say, I gave myself a waiver.
[00:35:25.291 --> 00:35:27.192]  Yeah, and made it legal, huh?
[00:35:27.618 --> 00:35:30.734]  I mean, can I give myself a waiver, Congressman, to rob banks?
[00:35:31.377 --> 00:35:42.004]  You know, they gave the, I can't remember which company it was, but they were bankrupt and we bailed them out and all, and they still had a tax problem, so they just wrote the taxes off, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:35:42.004 --> 00:35:47.168]  Oh, okay, those last three years' taxes, you had a lot of trouble, so you don't have to pay those taxes.
[00:35:47.168 --> 00:36:01.257]  Can you imagine if you had a tax problem and you had difficulty with the IRS, well, we know you had trouble, so you don't have to pay those back taxes, but that's the way the system works, unfortunately.
[00:36:01.838 --> 00:36:05.444]  Dr. Ron Paul, Congressman Ron Paul joining us, got about eight minutes left here.
[00:36:05.444 --> 00:36:12.898]  Sir, I saw a Bloomberg report where Goldman Sachs is arming its employees literally against the public with pitchforks.
[00:36:15.029 --> 00:36:18.831]  In Washington, are they starting to get the same sense that Wall Street is?
[00:36:18.831 --> 00:36:26.454]  That the people are recognizing their criminal activity, passing unconstitutional bills without even reading it?
[00:36:26.454 --> 00:36:29.516]  Because it seems that Washington's only getting more criminal.
[00:36:29.516 --> 00:36:30.676]  They don't seem to care.
[00:36:30.676 --> 00:36:34.618]  Or is it more like rats running off the sinking ship with the loot?
[00:36:35.242 --> 00:36:37.463]  Well, there's some of that.
[00:36:37.463 --> 00:36:43.546]  I work on the assumption that Washington is usually about 10-15 years behind what the people are thinking.
[00:36:43.546 --> 00:36:50.390]  So, I don't think a person like Nancy Pelosi is aware of what the people are really thinking.
[00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:58.394]  You know, if she heard about the Tea Party movement, I mean, she writes it off as one or two percent of the population that are all nuts.
[00:36:59.094 --> 00:37:01.837]  And she just totally dismisses it.
[00:37:01.837 --> 00:37:04.739]  So that's where, generally, Washington is.
[00:37:04.739 --> 00:37:10.084]  I just don't think that they're quite aware of what's happening with the grassroots.
[00:37:10.084 --> 00:37:14.027]  And I think that's where the real changes are occurring.
[00:37:14.027 --> 00:37:18.231]  And, of course, I'm always hopeful that there's some real changes with the young people.
[00:37:18.231 --> 00:37:22.475]  So that's why I keep talking to myself so that I'm always hopeful.
[00:37:24.474 --> 00:37:32.180]  Speaking of hopefulness, Iceland, it looks like, may say, no, we're not going to pay off private debt.
[00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:35.342]  England is listing all Icelanders basically as terrorists.
[00:37:35.342 --> 00:37:40.105]  They can grab and hold the money that's in British banks.
[00:37:40.105 --> 00:37:42.667]  Goldman Sachs has been caught engineering that crisis.
[00:37:42.667 --> 00:37:43.728]  That's come out in the news.
[00:37:43.728 --> 00:37:48.852]  I mean, shouldn't we just tell these private banks, we're not going to give you any more bailout money?
[00:37:49.858 --> 00:37:55.202]  Well, we should have never given it in the first place, and we shouldn't give any more.
[00:37:55.202 --> 00:37:58.505]  Besides, pretty soon it'll be worthless and won't matter much.
[00:37:58.505 --> 00:38:01.107]  So, the more you give away, you create money out of thin air.
[00:38:01.107 --> 00:38:07.512]  The more you give away, you may temporarily help some of their friends, but it's just more of the same thing.
[00:38:07.512 --> 00:38:10.454]  That's how we got into this trouble, and that's how they're going to keep it going.
[00:38:11.514 --> 00:38:17.920]  A lot of economists are saying we could have total depression within the next year, the real economy over 20% unemployment.
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:20.482]  All the numbers that I know you're well aware of are really bad.
[00:38:20.482 --> 00:38:32.133]  While the mainstream media says this is a great economy because the big banks are making money off the bailout, the dollars continuing its slide went up for a little bit, but still overall it's going down.
[00:38:32.133 --> 00:38:34.015]  Where do you see us in two years, Congressman?
[00:38:35.091 --> 00:38:37.533]  I think we're going to be much poorer as a nation.
[00:38:37.533 --> 00:38:39.674]  I think unemployment rates are going to stay very high.
[00:38:39.674 --> 00:38:44.158]  I think by two years it'll be acknowledged that there was no recovery.
[00:38:44.158 --> 00:38:49.922]  I thought there were some very good articles, and I commented on one this past week about Paul Krugman.
[00:38:50.382 --> 00:38:54.105]  You know, he analyzed the past 10 years, and he had a good analysis.
[00:38:54.105 --> 00:38:55.966]  We're all worse off.
[00:38:55.966 --> 00:39:01.349]  Real income has not gone up, and investments have not gone up.
[00:39:01.349 --> 00:39:06.252]  He did say that you'd be even-steven on your stocks from 10 years ago, but you're actually lower.
[00:39:06.252 --> 00:39:09.494]  If you take into account the inflation, you're down about 20%.
[00:39:10.755 --> 00:39:17.699]  But, of course, he said what we needed was more spending and more regulations, and that would have solved all that problem.
[00:39:17.699 --> 00:39:20.520]  But, no, I think it started ten years ago.
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:23.862]  I think we started slipping into the recession, depression.
[00:39:23.862 --> 00:39:29.705]  I think there's no sign that we have reversed things.
[00:39:29.705 --> 00:39:32.627]  They talk themselves into thinking that things are improving.
[00:39:32.627 --> 00:39:38.270]  When the dot-com bubble burst, they didn't allow the correction to occur, so they created a housing bubble.
[00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:41.911]  Well, they started feeling better, but it didn't solve the problem.
[00:39:41.911 --> 00:39:44.752]  Now, a lot of people don't have houses.
[00:39:44.752 --> 00:39:47.853]  But you don't believe gold is a bubble?
[00:39:47.853 --> 00:39:49.533]  No, I don't believe that.
[00:39:49.533 --> 00:39:51.434]  So that's an inflationary issue?
[00:39:51.434 --> 00:40:00.177]  I think gold reflects, if anything, it's way behind because the bubble is the size of the dollars created.
[00:40:00.177 --> 00:40:07.219]  The real bubble, I think, is in the bond market because the price of bonds are so good because the interest rates are so low.
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.922]  But that's just being held together.
[00:40:10.922 --> 00:40:17.247]  I think this is what the Fed does in collusion with other central banks is they prop that market up.
[00:40:17.247 --> 00:40:19.589]  So if gold met inflation, what would it be like?
[00:40:19.589 --> 00:40:19.790]  $2,500 an ounce?
[00:40:25.421 --> 00:40:26.903]  It would be a lot higher.
[00:40:26.903 --> 00:40:32.869]  I don't think the market's been allowed to adjust to that yet.
[00:40:32.869 --> 00:40:39.076]  That's the other thing that an audit might reveal, is how much they're involved in the gold market.
[00:40:39.076 --> 00:40:43.281]  The governments have always been involved in gold, even when they had gold in
[00:40:43.641 --> 00:40:44.062]  Absolutely.
[00:41:01.104 --> 00:41:04.247]  It's a different way now, but they're working very hard.
[00:41:04.247 --> 00:41:08.510]  They know that a high price of gold is a vote against paper.
[00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:17.157]  They can't allow the people to question the paper money because their kingdom is finished when the people question it.
[00:41:17.157 --> 00:41:18.798]  They're only beginning to question it.
[00:41:18.798 --> 00:41:23.202]  So, if anything, gold is a long way from a bubble.
[00:41:23.202 --> 00:41:24.543]  The real bubble is in the
[00:41:25.163 --> 00:41:30.848]  The size of the currency market and the value of the dollar is artificially high, and the bonds are artificially high.
[00:41:30.848 --> 00:41:33.030]  Congressman, I totally agree with you.
[00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:35.132]  In the last minute and a half, we've got left.
[00:41:35.132 --> 00:41:41.318]  Homeschoolers in California, they ruled a couple years ago that homeschooling's a privilege, that the state owns their children.
[00:41:41.318 --> 00:41:42.579]  That got overturned.
[00:41:42.579 --> 00:41:47.183]  CBS News reports these people moved to the town, didn't register their kids.
[00:41:47.183 --> 00:41:48.324]  It was a civil matter.
[00:41:49.045 --> 00:41:52.668]  But the CPS said, yeah, but that's child endangerment.
[00:41:52.668 --> 00:41:55.811]  And so they were arrested through color of law.
[00:41:55.811 --> 00:41:59.595]  And the school is on television saying they deserve to go to jail.
[00:41:59.595 --> 00:42:02.738]  I mean, this is slavery in my view.
[00:42:02.738 --> 00:42:07.043]  I mean, if we can't raise our children and be left alone by the state, we might as well be the Soviet Union.
[00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:09.261]  We're good to go.
[00:42:27.883 --> 00:42:32.705]  And there was some court fights and we won those, but no, they will never give up on that.
[00:42:32.705 --> 00:42:34.285]  They never give up on control of money.
[00:42:34.285 --> 00:42:38.686]  They will never give up on the control of the education of the young children.
[00:42:38.686 --> 00:42:45.128]  Just think of how they brainwash young children on global warming and some of this radical environmentalism.
[00:42:45.128 --> 00:42:56.352]  So that's a big fight, but hopefully it'll backfire on them and it'll just wake the people up because there's sure a lot of homeschoolers around these days and they're very strong on the Constitution.
[00:42:56.352 --> 00:42:57.052]  They've learned the Constitution.
[00:43:00.454 --> 00:43:05.018]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:43:05.018 --> 00:43:09.341]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:43:09.341 --> 00:43:15.105]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:43:15.105 --> 00:43:15.846]  It's true.
[00:43:15.846 --> 00:43:20.389]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:43:20.709 --> 00:43:21.530]  Number 3.
[00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:25.112]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:43:25.112 --> 00:43:29.035]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:43:29.035 --> 00:43:29.835]  Number 4.
[00:43:29.835 --> 00:43:32.597]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:43:32.597 --> 00:43:36.279]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:43:36.279 --> 00:43:37.060]  Number 5.
[00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:41.203]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:43:41.203 --> 00:43:45.966]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:44:00.899 --> 00:44:03.921]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:44:03.921 --> 00:44:09.246]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:44:09.246 --> 00:44:11.287]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:44:11.287 --> 00:44:16.291]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:44:16.291 --> 00:44:17.212]  How much do you want?
[00:44:17.472 --> 00:44:18.593]  When do you want it?
[00:44:18.593 --> 00:44:20.474]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:44:20.474 --> 00:44:21.555]  When will you need it?
[00:44:21.555 --> 00:44:23.757]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:44:23.757 --> 00:44:25.098]  Will there be any food?
[00:44:25.098 --> 00:44:26.619]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:44:26.619 --> 00:44:31.883]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:44:31.883 --> 00:44:35.486]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:44:35.486 --> 00:44:38.949]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:44:39.289 --> 00:44:40.511]  How much will you need?
[00:44:40.511 --> 00:44:41.412]  We don't know.
[00:44:41.412 --> 00:44:42.533]  How much do you want?
[00:44:42.533 --> 00:44:43.454]  All you can get.
[00:44:43.454 --> 00:44:44.555]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:44:44.555 --> 00:44:47.599]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[00:45:06.856 --> 00:45:08.136]  No, this isn't science fiction.

[00:45:59.639 --> 00:46:04.181]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:46:04.181 --> 00:46:05.101]  Number one.
[00:46:05.101 --> 00:46:08.523]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:46:08.523 --> 00:46:09.383]  Number two.
[00:46:09.383 --> 00:46:14.265]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:46:14.265 --> 00:46:15.025]  It's true.
[00:46:15.025 --> 00:46:19.567]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:46:19.887 --> 00:46:20.708]  Number 3.
[00:46:20.708 --> 00:46:24.291]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:46:24.291 --> 00:46:28.214]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:46:28.214 --> 00:46:29.014]  Number 4.
[00:46:29.014 --> 00:46:31.776]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:46:31.776 --> 00:46:35.459]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:46:35.459 --> 00:46:36.240]  Number 5.
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:40.383]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:46:40.383 --> 00:46:45.147]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:46:49.610 --> 00:46:51.392]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:46:51.392 --> 00:46:53.654]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:46:53.654 --> 00:46:56.256]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:46:56.256 --> 00:47:03.061]  Coast to Coast.
[00:47:03.061 --> 00:47:05.103]  Direct from Austin.
[00:47:05.103 --> 00:47:08.305]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:47:11.886 --> 00:47:18.519]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:47:18.519 --> 00:47:21.505]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:47:23.343 --> 00:47:26.726]  Debra Medina is our guest, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:26.726 --> 00:47:29.609]  She's been in the first big Republican debate.
[00:47:29.609 --> 00:47:30.750]  Hands down, won it.
[00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:32.452]  Many newspapers are saying that.
[00:47:32.452 --> 00:47:39.138]  The grassroots that I've been monitoring is conclusively saying that they want to know more about Debra Medina.
[00:47:39.138 --> 00:47:42.201]  But the first big issue, we have an article at to infowars.com
[00:47:44.182 --> 00:48:06.997]  Governor candidate Debra Medina excluded from televised debate the next key debate coming up January 29th right before the key primary right before voters really make their decision and with your incredible showing last night your poll numbers going up even higher they need to put you in there but I've read that below the big globalist corporation that owns a lot of the TV stations and Dallas Morning News
[00:48:07.677 --> 00:48:15.202]  They're saying not only do you have to have 15 percent, you've got to be able, in the past, to have held a comparable political position.
[00:48:15.202 --> 00:48:16.383]  So you should have been a U.S.
[00:48:16.383 --> 00:48:21.006]  senator or a Texas governor or lieutenant governor to be able to be on the same stage.
[00:48:21.006 --> 00:48:26.510]  By that yardstick, only super high-powered politicians can be in debates.
[00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:30.993]  I mean, they're really, as they see the revolution of awakening back to the Constitution happening,
[00:48:31.613 --> 00:48:35.156]  They are bringing out a new standard that no one can get over.
[00:48:35.156 --> 00:48:36.637]  You can't just be a mayor.
[00:48:36.637 --> 00:48:39.960]  You can't be a state representative and be in a debate now for governor.
[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:42.822]  You have to have been a former governor or U.S.
[00:48:42.822 --> 00:48:43.203]  senator.
[00:48:44.751 --> 00:48:46.572]  This is clearly discriminatory.
[00:48:46.572 --> 00:48:49.133]  People need to boycott Velo if they don't change this.
[00:48:49.133 --> 00:48:50.694]  Dump the Dallas Morning News.
[00:48:50.694 --> 00:48:55.256]  They need to look at their past policies because they're doing a quasi-public thing.
[00:48:55.256 --> 00:48:59.639]  They're acting like it's a public debate, but really they're skewing it.
[00:48:59.639 --> 00:49:03.180]  Or people need to boycott this debate and call for other real debates.
[00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:08.363]  Deborah Medina, running for governor here in Texas, give us your breakdown on this.
[00:49:09.158 --> 00:49:24.449]  Well, I think, you know, we've talked about this political royal class in America and this is more evidence that at least the political establishment and those that support them seem to have, you know, have an agenda to further that.
[00:49:24.449 --> 00:49:28.953]  I hope that we'll use the free market to put pressure on Velo.
[00:49:28.953 --> 00:49:34.757]  I know that there are supporters out there talking with their advertisers and clearly making it known to them that
[00:49:35.217 --> 00:49:37.080]  They want this debate to happen in Texas.
[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:40.685]  They want all three candidates to be heard from and we need another opportunity.
[00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:46.565]  To see all three of us on stage and allow the voter to make a choice in the next election.
[00:49:46.565 --> 00:49:56.334]  So people can help us out by calling below and letting them know about that, but also by calling their advertisers and their support, you know, their customer base and letting them know.
[00:49:56.334 --> 00:50:06.224]  And then help us out by visiting medinafortexas.com and driving dollars our way so that we can buy the media and get out there, get the message out between now and March 2nd.
[00:50:07.659 --> 00:50:19.526]  Well, Deborah, I mean, looking at this, it's so outrageous to read the policy, the new policy of VELO, that you have to have 15% in the polls, and on top of it,
[00:50:21.357 --> 00:50:42.317]  You have to and before it was 15% in the polls in the final debate between Republicans and Democrats and third parties and that was at the national level and they only brought that policy in the last eight years more restrictive than what was there previously but to now in a primary debate say not only do you have to have 15% you've got to hold comparable
[00:50:44.259 --> 00:51:11.512]  Public status so you would have had to be a governor from another state or a US senator to be able to be on that stage that is an impossible hurdle that on its face is fraud I mean this is they must be scared to death of The grassroots and now they might just come right out and ban third parties or ban Candidates from higher office if you weren't already in higher office I mean how will people get into higher office if you have to first be in the highest level of executive office?
[00:51:11.512 --> 00:51:12.052]  I mean this isn't
[00:51:12.472 --> 00:51:13.453]  This is outrageous!
[00:51:13.453 --> 00:51:16.494]  Well, and it's just totally ignoring even the candidacy.
[00:51:16.494 --> 00:51:22.798]  You know, the rest of the media all over Texas, and certainly the grassroots, is abuzz with what happened in that debate last night.
[00:51:22.798 --> 00:51:32.163]  And yet, when you read the Dallas Morning News and their report of the debate, they kind of leave Debra Medina out, almost as though I wasn't on stage.
[00:51:32.163 --> 00:51:36.125]  It's like, were you even at the same debate the rest of Texas was watching?
[00:51:36.125 --> 00:51:39.667]  Because to read their report, they don't
[00:51:40.191 --> 00:51:43.413]  They don't address the Debra Medina factor at all.
[00:51:43.413 --> 00:51:47.135]  And I guess clearly that's where the establishment would like to see.
[00:51:47.135 --> 00:51:49.336]  They don't want people rising up.
[00:51:49.336 --> 00:51:59.982]  They want us to be worker bees, serving that political class, but not out here producing on our own and being independent and enjoying the liberty that our founders, you know,
[00:52:02.443 --> 00:52:12.248]  Put into that Constitution, I mean, they set this nation up so that we can enjoy that freedom and prosperity that's God-given life, liberty, property.
[00:52:12.248 --> 00:52:13.808]  That's not yours to give.
[00:52:13.808 --> 00:52:16.289]  It was given to us by the Creator.
[00:52:16.289 --> 00:52:28.535]  It's yours to protect and preserve, and the Constitution gives us the way, gives us the blueprint by which to do that, and yet we've got just exactly what our founders knew we were going to have, this abuse,
[00:52:32.346 --> 00:52:45.012]  Well, Perry's one talking point was that you and Kay Bailey Hutchinson hate Texas and are saying Texas is bad when you're trying to save what Texas is.
[00:52:45.012 --> 00:52:52.155]  It's Perry that masquerades as a conservative, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson is even worse, if that's possible, from Washington.
[00:52:53.135 --> 00:53:01.080]  And they have brought in, conservatively, a $400 million looting deal to grab 8,000 miles of existing roads and put toll roads on them.
[00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:04.702]  They're both involved, up to their eyeballs in it, though they now try to deny that.
[00:53:04.702 --> 00:53:07.703]  It's on record they are.
[00:53:07.703 --> 00:53:11.345]  Texas has passed all these new districts for taxing.
[00:53:11.345 --> 00:53:17.469]  Every few months, a new bureaucrat shows up and tells me about some new tax that my little office has to pay.
[00:53:17.469 --> 00:53:21.751]  We are turning into California or New York or Illinois or something.
[00:53:22.071 --> 00:53:27.154]  Texas does have people flooding to it because it's not as bad as other states, but not for long.
[00:53:27.154 --> 00:53:32.277]  I mean, you're trying to save Texas as a haven of low taxes and low regulation.
[00:53:32.277 --> 00:53:40.002]  And we know what K-Baby and Mr. Hairspray, Pretty Hair, Twinkle Toes, Perry is going to do.
[00:53:40.002 --> 00:53:41.303]  And for him to try to spin it,
[00:53:42.343 --> 00:53:44.564]  That you're bad-mouthing Texas.
[00:53:44.564 --> 00:53:47.345]  It's just more fraud from this guy.
[00:53:47.345 --> 00:53:49.786]  The sales taxes keep going up.
[00:53:49.786 --> 00:53:54.288]  The property taxes keep going up, even as housing prices go down.
[00:53:54.288 --> 00:53:57.630]  Can you speak to what you would do as governor to the tax system?
[00:53:57.630 --> 00:54:00.831]  Well, we've got to eliminate property tax.
[00:54:00.831 --> 00:54:01.911]  Eliminate!
[00:54:01.911 --> 00:54:03.932]  We didn't have it before and built this country.
[00:54:03.932 --> 00:54:05.153]  Eliminate it!
[00:54:05.153 --> 00:54:06.933]  It's a tax on your property.
[00:54:06.933 --> 00:54:07.654]  It's rent.
[00:54:07.654 --> 00:54:10.295]  You don't really own your property, the founders said, if you have a property tax.
[00:54:10.902 --> 00:54:12.263]  We've got to eliminate property tax.
[00:54:12.263 --> 00:54:16.005]  We've got to recognize that we do need some essential government services.
[00:54:16.005 --> 00:54:21.369]  There are some things that cities and counties in the state government need to do, and clearly they need funds for that.
[00:54:21.369 --> 00:54:30.255]  But the best way to raise that money, the taxing method that causes the least drag on a free and prosperous economy is a sales tax.
[00:54:30.255 --> 00:54:31.476]  We need to broaden the base.
[00:54:32.088 --> 00:54:32.528]  I don't know.
[00:54:54.898 --> 00:54:59.763]  We've got to do that, but I think that the governor, you know, he'd like to paint this really rosy picture.
[00:54:59.763 --> 00:55:09.773]  I guess as a registered nurse, my job wasn't to look at how healthy I would like for you to be, but to deal with the reality of what your clinical conditions and signs are.
[00:55:09.773 --> 00:55:14.578]  And the reality of the economic condition here in Texas isn't near as rosy as he'd like to paint it.
[00:55:15.098 --> 00:55:17.280]  I certainly am not about tearing Texas down.
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:28.111]  I'm about being a realist and looking at objectively where we are, figuring out what's hindering us, and getting us on the path to that freedom and prosperity that we ought to be enjoying.
[00:55:34.039 --> 00:55:38.360]  Employment numbers going up, that is a bold-faced lie.
[00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:41.521]  You are creating more of a burden on the private sector.
[00:55:41.521 --> 00:55:47.762]  We've added 156,000 jobs in the public sector in the last four years.
[00:55:47.762 --> 00:55:55.584]  He's boasting about adding 142,000 to the Texas economy in the last four years, but all of those have been in the public sector.
[00:55:55.584 --> 00:55:58.525]  We've lost 14,000 jobs in the private sector.
[00:55:58.525 --> 00:55:59.645]  That's not job growth.
[00:56:01.241 --> 00:56:01.861]  Absolutely.
[00:56:01.861 --> 00:56:10.126]  So for those who don't understand, Texas is becoming like Massachusetts or New York, and Perry's saying in his doublespeak, that's a great thing.
[00:56:10.126 --> 00:56:13.788]  Deborah Medina's saying, no, go back the way Texas was.
[00:56:13.788 --> 00:56:15.850]  Make Texas great again.
[00:56:16.730 --> 00:56:18.811]  They're trying to raise the Texas gas tax.
[00:56:18.811 --> 00:56:21.692]  They're trying to do everything right now.
[00:56:21.692 --> 00:56:23.513]  We have got to block this.
[00:56:23.513 --> 00:56:26.114]  I mean, the economy is imploding in this state.
[00:56:26.114 --> 00:56:32.337]  Not as bad as other states, because we haven't had the blight of big government as much as other states.
[00:56:32.337 --> 00:56:37.700]  That's why people are running to Texas right now, running away from big government.
[00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:39.041]  Debra, I want to play a clip of you
[00:56:40.410 --> 00:56:41.351]  Alex, let me jump in.
[00:56:41.351 --> 00:56:44.634]  Not as bad as other states, because they overtaxed us a few years ago.
[00:56:44.634 --> 00:56:50.979]  Remember, he built up that rainy day fund to $20 billion because he was overtaxing Texans.
[00:56:50.979 --> 00:56:54.582]  Anybody that's got sitting on that kind of profit can weather a storm.
[00:56:54.582 --> 00:57:01.748]  That's why Texas is weathering the storm, because the governor and the legislature allowed those taxes to be overcollected in prior years.
[00:57:02.788 --> 00:57:06.871]  I think you and I read the Texas Consolidated Annual Financial Report.
[00:57:06.871 --> 00:57:09.332]  I'm not sure either Kay or Rick have ever looked at that.
[00:57:09.332 --> 00:57:15.616]  You can't be an executive and not know what the financial condition of your organization is.
[00:57:15.616 --> 00:57:21.139]  Texans deserve an accurate, honest annual financial report from our CEO.
[00:57:21.139 --> 00:57:24.001]  That's the governor and he's failed to do that time and time again.
[00:57:24.321 --> 00:57:32.664]  And he got upset when you brought that up because no one, ten years ago, when I first started exposing this with Walter Burien and made a film about it, no one knew about these.
[00:57:32.664 --> 00:57:35.446]  That's the real set of books, not the budget.
[00:57:35.446 --> 00:57:38.047]  The budget is the fake thing they push.
[00:57:38.047 --> 00:57:40.448]  And then, boy, you broke a big taboo.
[00:57:40.448 --> 00:57:43.369]  He got upset when you mentioned that little secret name.
[00:57:52.537 --> 00:57:56.498]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:57:56.498 --> 00:58:05.360]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:09.981]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:58:09.981 --> 00:58:20.803]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:58:21.443 --> 00:58:30.946]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:58:30.946 --> 00:58:36.388]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:58:36.388 --> 00:58:43.871]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:58:43.871 --> 00:58:46.612]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:58:51.778 --> 00:58:55.801]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:58:55.801 --> 00:58:59.044]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:58:59.044 --> 00:59:03.848]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:59:03.848 --> 00:59:10.253]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:59:10.253 --> 00:59:12.475]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:59:13.015 --> 00:59:13.315]  Tim Geithner?
[00:59:13.315 --> 00:59:13.816]  Bernanke?
[00:59:13.816 --> 00:59:14.617]  They're arsonists!
[00:59:14.617 --> 00:59:15.778]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:59:15.778 --> 00:59:18.020]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:59:31.912 --> 00:59:33.773]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:59:33.773 --> 00:59:39.196]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:59:39.196 --> 00:59:51.523]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:59:51.523 --> 00:59:55.126]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[00:59:55.126 --> 00:59:58.327]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:00:01.724 --> 01:00:04.125]  Well, you're an intelligent lady.
[01:00:04.125 --> 01:00:05.365]  You're a constitutionalist.
[01:00:05.365 --> 01:00:08.166]  People are really resonating with your message.
[01:00:08.166 --> 01:00:14.567]  And I just want to say again, regardless if you win or not, we all win because you've now injected real issues.
[01:00:14.567 --> 01:00:20.729]  And we're now growing the grassroots across the country, just like with what happened with Ron Paul.
[01:00:20.729 --> 01:00:29.411]  It is essential, though, that people support you, that they put your yard signs up, that they call local radio, that they call BELO and say, put you in the next debate.
[01:00:30.131 --> 01:00:37.135]  That they donate on your website or sign up at your Facebook or get your email and text message alerts.
[01:00:37.135 --> 01:00:38.195]  It is essential.
[01:00:38.195 --> 01:00:42.778]  And it's just the political will of getting involved will lead us to victory.
[01:00:42.778 --> 01:00:53.183]  We know the path of standing up for freedom will win if people just keep going, keep coming, and never back off and never stop.
[01:00:53.183 --> 01:00:59.487]  In the last three, four minutes we've got left, Debra Medina, other issues, other points you'd like to make to this worldwide audience?
[01:00:59.787 --> 01:01:02.368]  Well, I think I've got to pick up with where you're going.
[01:01:02.368 --> 01:01:03.789]  You're absolutely right, Alex.
[01:01:03.789 --> 01:01:05.230]  This is pedal to the metal.
[01:01:05.230 --> 01:01:08.452]  The only poll that counts is March 2nd.
[01:01:08.452 --> 01:01:10.493]  That is Texas Independence Day.
[01:01:10.493 --> 01:01:12.674]  The dominoes are falling our way.
[01:01:12.674 --> 01:01:16.416]  If you ever thought that there was a time when your vote
[01:01:18.023 --> 01:01:19.184]  It is now.
[01:01:19.184 --> 01:01:20.224]  You've got to get out.
[01:01:20.224 --> 01:01:30.507]  You've got to do all you can to raise the identity of this campaign, to help people know that there is someone carrying the voice of the people.
[01:01:30.507 --> 01:01:33.088]  I am just that vessel carrying that message.
[01:01:33.088 --> 01:01:34.708]  I'm honored to do it for Texas.
[01:01:34.708 --> 01:01:37.829]  I'm going to fight really hard, but we have got to have your help.
[01:01:38.329 --> 01:01:40.090]  We can win this race.
[01:01:40.090 --> 01:01:40.911]  Don't let up.
[01:01:40.911 --> 01:01:42.051]  Don't back off.
[01:01:42.051 --> 01:01:43.612]  This is a sprint to the finish.
[01:01:43.612 --> 01:01:47.774]  We're going to push really hard through until 7.01 p.m.
[01:01:47.774 --> 01:01:50.596]  on March 2nd and not let up a second before then.
[01:01:50.596 --> 01:01:53.517]  MedinaForTexas.com.
[01:01:53.517 --> 01:01:54.558]  Help us that way.
[01:01:54.558 --> 01:01:54.998]  Get out.
[01:01:54.998 --> 01:01:55.798]  Knock on doors.
[01:01:55.798 --> 01:01:57.039]  Let your neighbors know.
[01:01:57.039 --> 01:02:00.721]  Ask them to vote and then make sure that they go vote.
[01:02:01.241 --> 01:02:05.864]  So many people say, oh yeah, I'm all about that, and then they get busy and they don't vote.
[01:02:05.864 --> 01:02:08.685]  Early voting starts in February.
[01:02:08.685 --> 01:02:12.507]  Very important that we turn out and vote at the polls.
[01:02:12.507 --> 01:02:17.230]  Don't be discouraged by any negative media reports that you might see.
[01:02:17.230 --> 01:02:20.372]  I think we kind of took everybody by surprise last night.
[01:02:20.372 --> 01:02:27.516]  I expect in the next 48 to 72 hours they'll get their act together and they'll start putting the negative spin on this and trying to
[01:02:27.916 --> 01:02:33.438]  You know, kind of trying to marginalize the campaign and again say we're not going to have an impact on this race.
[01:02:33.438 --> 01:02:35.839]  Boy, we're going to have an impact and we saw that last night.
[01:02:35.839 --> 01:02:46.603]  There was a period, and I know, you know, we've got a lot of problems with Google, but there was a period last night that we were the number one search on Google and for several hours we were the number three search on Google.
[01:02:46.603 --> 01:02:50.264]  It went through not just Texas but the country like a firestorm.
[01:02:50.264 --> 01:02:55.426]  We can win this, but it means all of us have got to dig in until March 2nd and work hard.
[01:02:56.499 --> 01:02:59.680]  The people know we're being looted and being robbed.
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:03.122]  30 plus states are moving to declare sovereignty.
[01:03:03.122 --> 01:03:05.122]  The media spins that and says it's secession.
[01:03:05.122 --> 01:03:05.743]  No.
[01:03:05.743 --> 01:03:07.183]  The states created the federal government.
[01:03:07.183 --> 01:03:08.444]  They're saying no.
[01:03:08.444 --> 01:03:11.005]  The federal government's controlled by offshore banks.
[01:03:11.005 --> 01:03:11.985]  That's now public.
[01:03:11.985 --> 01:03:15.026]  Geithner's on the verge of being indicted.
[01:03:15.026 --> 01:03:15.707]  We now have
[01:03:17.148 --> 01:03:29.559]  This individual at the White House, Harvard professor Cass Sunstein, is now the head of federal regulation saying that he wants to ban free speech and the Second Amendment.
[01:03:29.559 --> 01:03:31.841]  I mean, he's actually saying it.
[01:03:32.822 --> 01:03:38.824]  On video, on television, and that he's the next guy set to be the next Supreme Court Justice.
[01:03:38.824 --> 01:03:40.325]  I mean, this country's in deep trouble.
[01:03:40.325 --> 01:03:41.685]  These people aren't playing games.
[01:03:41.685 --> 01:03:44.286]  You know, it's what caused the battle at the Alamo.
[01:03:44.286 --> 01:03:48.288]  You know, they're essentially declaring the Constitution null and void.
[01:03:48.288 --> 01:03:50.889]  We've got a rule of law here, we're just going to ignore it.
[01:03:51.349 --> 01:03:53.290]  We ignore it, we ignore it, we ignore it.
[01:03:53.290 --> 01:03:57.211]  That's when Travis drew a line in the sand and said, you know, we're not ignoring this.
[01:03:57.211 --> 01:04:02.073]  You're not going to toss out the Constitution and name yourself dictator.
[01:04:02.073 --> 01:04:03.313]  That's what's happening here.
[01:04:03.313 --> 01:04:04.834]  People see it.
[01:04:04.834 --> 01:04:13.057]  We will either fight today at the ballot box or our children will shed blood to regain the freedoms that we've lost.
[01:04:13.057 --> 01:04:13.917]  I think we know that.
[01:04:13.917 --> 01:04:15.638]  I think all of Texas knows that.
[01:04:15.638 --> 01:04:16.938]  Now's the time to dig in.
[01:04:16.938 --> 01:04:17.458]  Fight for us.
[01:04:17.458 --> 01:04:18.099]  And again!
[01:04:18.099 --> 01:04:18.559]  Let's go.
[01:04:19.059 --> 01:04:21.361]  You're just saying what everybody already knows.
[01:04:21.361 --> 01:04:26.727]  Finally, you're saying, and I hear all these people calling into talk radio saying, I want Medina.
[01:04:26.727 --> 01:04:27.968]  These other people are fakes.
[01:04:27.968 --> 01:04:32.913]  I'm hearing Democrats say, I want Medina, not some establishment Democrat who's an Obamanoid.
[01:04:32.913 --> 01:04:35.576]  People know the two big parties are a fraud.
[01:04:35.576 --> 01:04:36.236]  They know that
[01:04:37.401 --> 01:04:40.043]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[01:05:06.203 --> 01:05:08.966]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[01:05:08.966 --> 01:05:14.313]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[01:05:14.313 --> 01:05:18.798]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from Infowars.com.

[01:05:34.837 --> 01:05:36.819]  This film needs to be seen.
[01:05:36.819 --> 01:05:37.961]  Everybody needs to get it.

[01:05:48.744 --> 01:05:50.165]  Shadow Government.
[01:05:50.165 --> 01:05:52.386]  It gives Big Brother a black eye.
[01:05:52.386 --> 01:05:56.107]  Available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:05:56.107 --> 01:05:56.588]  Big Brother.
[01:05:56.588 --> 01:05:57.348]  Mainstream media.
[01:06:08.386 --> 01:06:10.148]  Government cover-ups.
[01:06:10.148 --> 01:06:11.730]  You want answers?
[01:06:11.730 --> 01:06:13.292]  Well, so does he.
[01:06:13.292 --> 01:06:17.476]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:17.476 --> 01:06:22.562]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:06:22.562 --> 01:06:24.724]  Solari.com is her website.
[01:06:24.724 --> 01:06:27.748]  Our websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:06:27.748 --> 01:06:29.129]  She's Katherine Austin Fitz.
[01:06:29.790 --> 01:06:39.281]  I was talking to Birgitta Jones-Dottier, leading the charge to beat the banks in Iceland, not tooting my horn, an example of what you, the activists, have done.
[01:06:39.281 --> 01:06:46.569]  A few months ago, she got a copy of the Obama deception, and she already knew a lot, but that helped give her even more info.
[01:06:47.230 --> 01:06:54.975]  And so another example of how the Obama deception, fall of the republic, the type of effect these films are having all over the world.
[01:06:54.975 --> 01:07:00.938]  Every few days I get newspapers calling up saying, these films have been seen tens of millions of times for free online.
[01:07:00.938 --> 01:07:03.160]  How much money are you making on those free views?
[01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:04.981]  And I say, nothing!
[01:07:04.981 --> 01:07:05.981]  I don't want money.
[01:07:05.981 --> 01:07:07.462]  I want freedom.
[01:07:07.462 --> 01:07:11.345]  I see every person we wake up like a diamond in my hand.
[01:07:11.345 --> 01:07:12.906]  I'm into defeating tyranny.
[01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:16.742]  I mean, again, it's a hierarchy of needs.
[01:07:16.742 --> 01:07:19.004]  I own stuff, but stuff doesn't own me.
[01:07:19.004 --> 01:07:21.226]  I'm into truth and justice and liberty.
[01:07:21.226 --> 01:07:22.407]  I know that's not corny.
[01:07:22.407 --> 01:07:23.488]  I know that's real.
[01:07:23.488 --> 01:07:26.070]  I want my children to live in a free society.
[01:07:26.070 --> 01:07:27.611]  My son and my daughters.
[01:07:27.611 --> 01:07:30.973]  I want my grandchildren, who aren't even born yet, to live in a free society.
[01:07:32.014 --> 01:07:38.259]  They won't even be able to have children under the one-child policy if the globalists are successful.
[01:07:38.259 --> 01:07:41.522]  Now, Catherine Austin Fitts has an amazing bio.
[01:07:41.522 --> 01:07:51.670]  She has managed more than 25 billion of transactions and invested to date and has led a portfolio strategy for 300 billion of financial assets and liabilities.
[01:07:51.670 --> 01:07:58.075]  She was also the number two person at the Department of Housing, Assistant Secretary of Housing, and
[01:07:59.625 --> 01:08:02.587]  The commissioner of the first Bush administration.
[01:08:02.587 --> 01:08:05.629]  And it just goes on and on and on, the things that she's done.
[01:08:05.629 --> 01:08:12.993]  Again, Assistant Secretary of Housing, Federal Housing Commissioner in the first Bush administration of President Hamilton Securities Group, Washington D.C.
[01:08:12.993 --> 01:08:13.693]  Investment Bank.
[01:08:13.693 --> 01:08:17.956]  Super high-powered lady in the system coming out and exposing it.
[01:08:17.956 --> 01:08:22.738]  And she's talked about the crimes committed by Geithner and other people.
[01:08:22.738 --> 01:08:26.701]  And you have Geithner at the New York Fed that runs policy for the Fed.
[01:08:27.341 --> 01:08:44.273]  You have Paulson at the time at Treasury, the former head of Goldman Sachs, Geithner formerly of Goldman Sachs, giving themselves a hundred cents on the dollar for made-up derivatives they made that the public had no contractual agreement to pay for to them.
[01:08:44.873 --> 01:08:48.035]  You have them also ordering AIG to make it secret.
[01:08:48.035 --> 01:08:54.080]  And now that's continued on and that clearly, according to Judge Napolitano and many others, is a federal crime.
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:56.902]  But somebody who really understands this is Katherine Austin Fitch.
[01:08:56.902 --> 01:08:59.404]  So we're going to talk about Bankstergate or Bankergate.
[01:08:59.404 --> 01:09:05.269]  I don't want to call it just Timmy Geithnergate, Tiny Timgate, because he's just one of these people.
[01:09:05.269 --> 01:09:06.910]  It goes to Larry Summers.
[01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:08.591]  It goes to Robert Rubin.
[01:09:08.591 --> 01:09:09.892]  It goes to Ben Bernanke.
[01:09:09.892 --> 01:09:12.474]  It goes to everybody that got rid of the Glass-Steagall Act.
[01:09:12.774 --> 01:09:16.275]  So joining us is a true bonafide expert in all of this.
[01:09:16.275 --> 01:09:18.256]  Kathryn Austin-Fitz, great to have you on with us.
[01:09:18.256 --> 01:09:21.136]  Alex, it's always a privilege and a pleasure.
[01:09:21.136 --> 01:09:30.719]  You know what I would love to tell everybody about is how important this Geithner story is.
[01:09:30.719 --> 01:09:38.061]  You know, it kind of seems like a big inside baseball squabble, but I really want everyone to understand what's at the heart of this.
[01:09:39.557 --> 01:09:40.679]  I want to use a metaphor.
[01:09:40.679 --> 01:09:42.623]  Let's pretend you have a neighbor.
[01:09:42.623 --> 01:09:48.374]  And every time, whenever you and your wife go to buy a car, you have to pay 5% to get a loan.
[01:09:48.374 --> 01:09:49.497]  But he can get a loan for 0 or 1%.
[01:09:51.266 --> 01:09:58.428]  And then when you get a mortgage, you have to pay, you know, 8 to 10 percent, but he can get a mortgage for 0 or 1 percent.
[01:09:58.428 --> 01:10:08.890]  And then when he starts a business, he can get special loans from the local municipality for 0 percent, and then you have to, you know, use your savings or borrow your money or take another loan on your house.
[01:10:08.890 --> 01:10:15.372]  Well, it doesn't take long to figure that he's going to, you know, if this keeps going on, he's going to be able to buy up everything in town, right?
[01:10:16.069 --> 01:10:16.489]  Yes.
[01:10:16.489 --> 01:10:20.893]  And that's what this is about is we've got two classes of players.
[01:10:20.893 --> 01:10:30.860]  We've got a Federal Reserve Bank that's saying we reserve the right to provide low-cost, if not free, cost of capital and even now gifts.
[01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:32.581]  You know, so instead of him borrowing money at 1%,
[01:10:33.422 --> 01:10:39.764]  They just give him the money so he can buy, you know, all the houses up in the neighborhood.
[01:10:39.764 --> 01:10:53.590]  And what we're talking is a backdoor financial mechanism that allows a small group of people to basically buy up and take control of everything because they have, you know, low cost to free money, whereas everybody else has to pay, you know,
[01:10:55.650 --> 01:10:58.531]  Market rate, you know, or a much higher rate, number one.
[01:10:58.531 --> 01:11:06.894]  But number two, if, let's say, he gets in trouble, he gets bailed out, you get in trouble, you lose your house, you lose your car, you lose your family.
[01:11:06.894 --> 01:11:15.457]  And so we're talking about a society that is turning into a, you know, two societies, two economies.
[01:11:15.457 --> 01:11:17.358]  And one is getting rigged money.
[01:11:17.358 --> 01:11:18.778]  And that's what this is about.
[01:11:18.778 --> 01:11:24.020]  Because if you've got a Secretary of the Treasury who's basically trying to rig things,
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:26.043]  Not for the people who are productive.
[01:11:26.043 --> 01:11:28.507]  Not for the people who are making our economy strong.
[01:11:28.507 --> 01:11:30.110]  Not for the people who are creating jobs.
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:38.402]  With the people who are the best dirty players, then, you know, it's, for a financial person, this can go no place good.
[01:11:38.402 --> 01:11:49.125]  It can never work, because instead of allocating capital based to, you know, who's productive, we're allocating capital to who's the best dirty player with the most inside pull.
[01:11:49.125 --> 01:11:56.228]  You know, it's kind of devolved into, you know, the schoolyard in Lord of the Rings or something.
[01:11:58.379 --> 01:12:01.021]  You know, in Animal Farm.
[01:12:01.021 --> 01:12:05.383]  This is the financial version of Animal Farm, and that's what this is about.
[01:12:05.383 --> 01:12:18.910]  Because we've seen, you know, since the beginning of the Republic, until two years ago, in all the wars, Alex, in all the programs, in all the government waste, in all the government spending, we've built up $12 trillion of debt.
[01:12:18.910 --> 01:12:21.492]  And then, in a year and a half,
[01:12:23.891 --> 01:12:32.834]  This administration has lent or given as a gift $12 trillion to Wall Street and the financial firms.
[01:12:32.834 --> 01:12:41.236]  And that is, can you imagine, that is the amount equivalent to all the money we've ever borrowed since the beginning of the republic.
[01:12:41.236 --> 01:12:42.197]  It's incredible.
[01:12:42.197 --> 01:12:43.497]  It's a financial coup d'etat.
[01:12:44.488 --> 01:12:52.232]  And that's what it's about, and the power of this thing is, are we going to create a level playing field, or are we not?
[01:12:52.232 --> 01:13:13.242]  Because if we're going to rig, if we've got a Secretary of the Treasury who's going to rig the game, you know, in visible, secretive ways, and one of the magical things here is, and I've got to give him a lot of credit, is Bloomberg has brought a lawsuit, they won in the first round in August, for Freedom of Information Act against the Federal Reserve.
[01:13:14.017 --> 01:13:38.217]  Um, brought a lawsuit, and won in the first round in August, and the Fed has now appealed, it's in the Court of Appeals, and the Fed is saying, we need the ability to lend an insider group of firms $2 trillion, which is part of the $12 trillion, and not tell you who got it and on what terms, and we don't have to provide that under freedom of information law.
[01:13:38.217 --> 01:13:40.920]  It's just, it's an arrogance which takes your breath away.
[01:13:41.914 --> 01:13:46.538]  And they're setting the precedent to do even more in the future.
[01:13:46.538 --> 01:13:50.702]  And you talk about a rigged game where they get the free money and now it's just given to them.
[01:13:50.702 --> 01:14:00.490]  They then use that money as weapons to buy off states, buy media, buy infrastructure, blow out third world countries, now blow out first world nations.
[01:14:00.490 --> 01:14:06.375]  And they have their people in both parties, as you know, in all the major regulatory positions
[01:14:07.236 --> 01:14:10.800]  And I think that's why they're so arrogant now, is they're going for broke.
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:22.891]  The big question is, and I want to get into how we can push to get Geithner indicted or a special prosecutor or something like that, but the big question is, where are they headed if we don't stop them?
[01:14:22.891 --> 01:14:30.559]  Because they have the incentive to shut off money to Main Street so it's destitute, so they can come in and buy it up for pennies on the dollar.
[01:14:30.559 --> 01:14:31.640]  Right, and that's what they're doing.
[01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:32.581]  We're good to go.
[01:14:49.341 --> 01:15:02.674]  As Assistant Secretary of Housing in 1989, and at the time FHA was the largest property owner because of our foreclosures, and then the RTC got created to handle the dispositions of the SNL.
[01:15:02.674 --> 01:15:09.120]  And we started to auction off, my secretary was on the board of the RTC and so I was involved.
[01:15:10.201 --> 01:15:15.127]  And we were taking in massive amounts of property, and the fraud, Alex, was off the charts.
[01:15:15.127 --> 01:15:21.735]  You know, you'd get a portfolio that says, there are 10 mortgages on this block in Detroit, and you'd go there, and there were no houses there.
[01:15:21.735 --> 01:15:24.178]  You know, so the fraud was off the charts.
[01:15:24.178 --> 01:15:28.563]  But what happened is, when the first bids came in, no one knew if the bids would work.
[01:15:29.435 --> 01:15:42.178]  And I looked at the first three bids and I said, oh my God, the people buying this are buying at 10 cents on the dollar what their syndicate sold two years ago for, you know, 200% of market value.
[01:15:42.178 --> 01:15:43.598]  So it was a pump and dump.
[01:15:43.598 --> 01:15:49.719]  And they were going to make, you know, they were going to triple, quadruple the money they'd made selling out at the high.
[01:15:49.719 --> 01:15:50.699]  So this is a scam.
[01:15:50.699 --> 01:15:51.340]  Shut up!
[01:15:54.382 --> 01:15:57.811]  We're good.
[01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:04.382]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:16:04.382 --> 01:16:09.704]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:16:09.704 --> 01:16:11.745]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:16:11.745 --> 01:16:16.748]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:16:16.748 --> 01:16:17.929]  How much do you want?
[01:16:17.929 --> 01:16:19.069]  When do you want it?
[01:16:19.069 --> 01:16:20.950]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:16:20.950 --> 01:16:22.011]  When will you need it?
[01:16:22.011 --> 01:16:24.212]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:16:24.212 --> 01:16:25.553]  Will there be any food?
[01:16:25.553 --> 01:16:27.093]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:16:27.093 --> 01:16:28.134]  If there's a quarantine,
[01:16:28.294 --> 01:16:29.616]  And you can't feed yourself?
[01:16:29.616 --> 01:16:32.339]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:16:32.339 --> 01:16:35.924]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:16:35.924 --> 01:16:39.749]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:16:39.749 --> 01:16:40.990]  How much will you need?
[01:16:40.990 --> 01:16:41.891]  We don't know.
[01:16:41.891 --> 01:16:42.993]  How much do you want?
[01:16:42.993 --> 01:16:43.934]  All you can get.
[01:16:43.934 --> 01:16:44.735]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:16:44.995 --> 01:16:48.059]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[01:18:07.214 --> 01:18:09.316]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.

[01:18:59.989 --> 01:19:04.533]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:19:04.533 --> 01:19:05.454]  Number one.
[01:19:05.454 --> 01:19:08.877]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:19:08.877 --> 01:19:09.738]  Number two.
[01:19:09.738 --> 01:19:14.623]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:19:14.623 --> 01:19:15.384]  It's true.
[01:19:15.384 --> 01:19:19.928]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:19:20.228 --> 01:19:21.049]  Number 3.
[01:19:21.049 --> 01:19:24.652]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:19:24.652 --> 01:19:28.556]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:19:28.556 --> 01:19:29.356]  Number 4.
[01:19:29.356 --> 01:19:32.119]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:19:32.119 --> 01:19:35.802]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:19:35.802 --> 01:19:36.603]  Number 5.
[01:19:36.603 --> 01:19:40.747]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:19:40.747 --> 01:19:45.511]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:19:45.791 --> 01:19:49.954]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:19:49.954 --> 01:19:51.735]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:19:51.735 --> 01:19:53.997]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:19:53.997 --> 01:19:56.598]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:19:56.598 --> 01:20:03.263]  Coast to Coast.
[01:20:03.263 --> 01:20:05.324]  Direct from Austin.
[01:20:05.324 --> 01:20:08.526]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:17.251 --> 01:20:23.162]  Obviously, ladies and gentlemen, they're trying to ram through government health care.
[01:20:23.162 --> 01:20:29.493]  The Democrats have now actually read it and discovered it's another bailout, another scam to the insurance companies owned by the banks.
[01:20:30.766 --> 01:20:33.449]  I want to get Catherine Austin Fitts' take on that.
[01:20:33.449 --> 01:20:39.554]  Also, they're now reporting hundreds of thousands dead in Haiti from the earthquake.
[01:20:39.554 --> 01:20:40.995]  Hundreds of thousands dead.
[01:20:40.995 --> 01:20:47.261]  I mean, they're talking about all Americans being naked body scanned and recorded, all courthouses having naked body scanners.
[01:20:47.261 --> 01:20:48.882]  They're going in all over the country.
[01:20:48.882 --> 01:20:51.605]  I found out two years ago, year and a half ago, Denver already had it.
[01:20:52.782 --> 01:20:53.943]  I'm kind of all over the map here.
[01:20:53.943 --> 01:20:55.183]  It's just crazy.
[01:20:55.183 --> 01:21:01.426]  Earthquakes kill hundreds of thousands, but we've all got to go through naked body scanners because somebody might blow an airplane up.
[01:21:01.426 --> 01:21:04.508]  Oh, men and women are fighting in France.
[01:21:04.508 --> 01:21:07.129]  150 plus people kill each other a year.
[01:21:07.129 --> 01:21:10.631]  Let's ban arguing or ban marriage outright.
[01:21:10.631 --> 01:21:12.872]  You know, that's the mindset of these tyrants.
[01:21:13.332 --> 01:21:13.932]  No, no, no, no.
[01:21:13.932 --> 01:21:18.215]  You know, because you're dealing, you know, you see the, it's like the Pillsbury Doughboy.
[01:21:18.215 --> 01:21:21.336]  You squeeze one place, it pops out another.
[01:21:21.336 --> 01:21:23.397]  And what you're seeing is the lockdown across the board.
[01:21:23.397 --> 01:21:25.338]  And it's, you know, it's coming in on, in every direction.
[01:21:42.501 --> 01:22:04.618]  And, you know, whether it's the economic insanity and sort of the two-class system or it's the, you know, what they're doing is they're rolling out all sorts of different controls because they know when people figure out that our retirement system has been basically moved offshore and now there's nothing to, you know, to keep the commitments, people are going to get upset.
[01:22:04.618 --> 01:22:11.464]  And by that time, they plan to have the food system and the health care system and all these different systems under lockdown.
[01:22:12.562 --> 01:22:20.689]  To me, one of the scariest ones you haven't brought up yet, Alex, is the idea of sending over a million Americans around to collect all sorts of data on all of us.
[01:22:20.689 --> 01:22:23.992]  I'm sure you've had... Have you ever had Edwin Black on the show to...
[01:22:24.608 --> 01:22:28.429]  To describe how the Nazis put together their original databases.
[01:22:28.429 --> 01:22:31.270]  Yes, he wrote the book on IBM.
[01:22:31.270 --> 01:22:40.532]  And yes, the census people are now telling people to tell them about their stocks and bonds and what type of toilet they have.
[01:22:40.532 --> 01:22:46.514]  And now TSA is just downloading a large percentage of people's computers without warrants and just saying, we're keeping it.
[01:22:47.034 --> 01:22:49.415]  I mean, it's just wall-to-wall evil.
[01:22:49.415 --> 01:22:55.676]  Meanwhile, Geithner and others, who is most to blame in the crime, in the criminal acts, from your expert view?
[01:22:55.676 --> 01:22:58.357]  How do we get Geithner indicted?
[01:22:58.357 --> 01:23:00.338]  I mean, there's open talk of it happening.
[01:23:00.338 --> 01:23:15.502]  Okay, well, here, and I think lots of pressure brought on, you know, this is a time when calls to Congress can make it very, and calls to the White House can make it very uncomfortable for the White House to not make a change here.
[01:23:16.229 --> 01:23:25.474]  But at the heart of this matter, if you really want to make a significant shift, what we're going to have to do is work at the state and local level, and let me describe why.
[01:23:25.474 --> 01:23:31.558]  Have you seen the Governor of Arizona's State of the State address yet?
[01:23:31.558 --> 01:23:32.359]  No, I haven't.
[01:23:32.359 --> 01:23:34.260]  Okay, it's fabulous.
[01:23:34.260 --> 01:23:41.564]  She just came out and she said, and this was on healthcare, she said there are 14 Attorney Generals around the country, State Attorney Generals.
[01:23:42.153 --> 01:23:50.356]  Now working together to prepare, you know, real Tenth Amendment arguments to stop the implementation of this health care reform.
[01:23:50.356 --> 01:23:55.198]  And if my Attorney General won't join them, I will.
[01:23:55.198 --> 01:23:55.918]  Wow.
[01:23:55.918 --> 01:23:56.378]  Right.
[01:23:56.378 --> 01:24:07.202]  And where this is all going to come down, it's going to come down to Tenth Amendment and where we can get a governor, an attorney general, and a majority of the sheriff in a jurisdiction.
[01:24:07.202 --> 01:24:10.323]  Because you know, Alex, the sheriff is the most powerful
[01:24:11.441 --> 01:24:16.543]  Uh, you know, I mean, the Sheriff's Office is more powerful than the military.
[01:24:16.543 --> 01:24:16.983]  Yes.
[01:24:16.983 --> 01:24:24.285]  So, you know, but where we can align the Attorney General, the Governor, and the majority of the Sheriffs in the jurisdiction, that's what's going to happen.
[01:24:24.285 --> 01:24:27.886]  Because the only thing that's going to stop this is when you say no.
[01:24:27.886 --> 01:24:34.748]  And when they say that, when they declare the 10th Amendment, that's when we're going to have to have an argument about the cash flows.
[01:24:34.748 --> 01:24:37.249]  Because you can't keep sending money to Washington
[01:24:37.805 --> 01:24:40.427]  If Washington keeps using it to break the law.
[01:24:40.427 --> 01:24:41.568]  And it's not just Washington.
[01:24:41.568 --> 01:24:44.090]  We have international banks running Washington.
[01:24:44.090 --> 01:24:46.331]  I mean, we don't have our government.
[01:24:46.331 --> 01:24:46.591]  Right.
[01:24:46.591 --> 01:24:48.313]  Congress is not in control.
[01:24:48.313 --> 01:24:52.336]  And so, you know, it's almost like we're at a party.
[01:24:52.336 --> 01:24:53.196]  Everybody's drunk.
[01:24:53.196 --> 01:24:53.997]  Everybody's stoned.
[01:24:53.997 --> 01:24:55.218]  Everything's out of control.
[01:24:55.218 --> 01:24:57.860]  Where do you build the power to say no?
[01:24:57.860 --> 01:25:01.662]  And ultimately, what you're going to have to do is you're going to need a combination of two things.
[01:25:02.879 --> 01:25:08.602]  A group of leadership, and it's going to come down to Governor, Attorney General, and sheriffs in a play.
[01:25:08.602 --> 01:25:11.303]  And either sheriff to show up and break up the party.
[01:25:11.303 --> 01:25:20.267]  Well, one, they're going to have to say no, but they're going to have to do something else, because what the federal government has been doing to prevent them from saying no is trying to get them to be financially dependent.
[01:25:20.267 --> 01:25:20.627]  Yes.
[01:25:20.627 --> 01:25:29.871]  And of course, the worst things get the economy, you know, we're in a downward spiral, and so we've got to reverse the economic spiral at the same time that you take a strong legal stand.
[01:25:30.239 --> 01:25:37.286]  Catherine Austin Fitts is our gracious guest, a very busy lady, spending time with us today.
[01:25:37.286 --> 01:25:39.708]  We appreciate her coming on.
[01:25:39.708 --> 01:25:49.899]  And you were getting into where all this is going, what these people are doing, the police state grid they're setting up, the magnitude of Bankstergate.
[01:25:50.579 --> 01:25:56.903]  And you very astutely, people said, well wait, Obama's been in office less than a year, right at a year next week.
[01:25:56.903 --> 01:25:59.785]  How can she say this administration for a year and a half?
[01:25:59.785 --> 01:26:17.877]  But all of my expert guests said that the last six months or so of Bush's reign, the power was fully given over to the Federal Reserve, to the banks, and that you had total fusion and coordination between the Bush bankers and the Obama bankers.
[01:26:17.877 --> 01:26:19.518]  This is completely bipartisan.
[01:26:20.049 --> 01:26:20.929]  Yes.
[01:26:20.929 --> 01:26:24.530]  You know, this is people who believe in freedom against people who don't.
[01:26:24.530 --> 01:26:28.512]  And it's got nothing to do with those kind of party lines.
[01:26:28.512 --> 01:26:41.016]  So this is totally bipartisan, and in fact, if you look at the people who've stayed between the Clinton administration and the Bush administration, or then held over between the Bush administration, at a deeper level, it's the same team.
[01:26:41.016 --> 01:26:43.657]  So this is not a two-party system.
[01:26:43.657 --> 01:26:45.077]  It's the party of
[01:26:47.685 --> 01:26:51.426]  Just us.
[01:26:51.426 --> 01:27:12.211]  Now, the opportunity again, Alex, is if in those states where we have alignment between the Governor, the Attorney General, and the Sheriff, or the majority of the Sheriffs, and you can take a legal stand, then the question is how do you re-engineer the cash flows so that the Federal Government and the Federal Reserve don't pull the rug out from under?
[01:27:12.211 --> 01:27:14.191]  And so there has to be an economic plan
[01:27:14.645 --> 01:27:18.848]  That has to deal with all the money we're sending to Washington and all the money we're getting back.
[01:27:18.848 --> 01:27:38.762]  And the reality is, I think there are very powerful legal arguments that say, at a state or local level, you can assert common law right of offset for all the money that's been stolen, all the money that's missing, escrow federal taxes, and say, you know something, don't send any money, we'll pay our own stuff here, and literally take control of the cash flows.
[01:27:39.806 --> 01:27:58.255]  But what it's going to mean is in a lot of different industries, we're going to have to start behaving in very productive ways because one of the ways that the money has worked is the bankers are allowed to get away with murder because we get a lot of subsidies and we've allowed ourselves to get very unproductive.
[01:27:58.255 --> 01:28:02.997]  So we have, for example, we have a whole local medical community and the infrastructure
[01:28:03.763 --> 01:28:10.208]  In every one of our places in state that is used to very, you know, it's got a very high cost infrastructure.
[01:28:10.208 --> 01:28:13.751]  So we're all going to have to organize and change.
[01:28:13.751 --> 01:28:20.196]  And the biggest one is we now have, you know, say I live in a county, the war on drugs is our biggest business.
[01:28:20.196 --> 01:28:21.897]  It's our biggest industry.
[01:28:21.897 --> 01:28:26.961]  And we don't have enough people to farm because everybody's too busy dealing or growing drugs.
[01:28:27.885 --> 01:28:33.527]  So, you know, we're going to have to change the local level, and we're going to have to get very, very productive.
[01:28:33.527 --> 01:28:38.569]  Now, if we're willing to do that, we can absolutely turn around the, you know, the economic spiral.
[01:28:38.569 --> 01:28:46.032]  Because it's small business that creates jobs, and at some point, prisons and drug dealing is, you know, is not something that makes a nation great.
[01:28:46.032 --> 01:28:49.753]  The parasite economy is killing the host.
[01:29:01.533 --> 01:29:04.534]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:29:04.534 --> 01:29:09.876]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:29:09.876 --> 01:29:11.917]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:29:11.917 --> 01:29:16.919]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:29:16.919 --> 01:29:18.100]  How much do you want?
[01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:19.220]  When do you want it?
[01:29:19.220 --> 01:29:21.101]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:29:21.101 --> 01:29:22.181]  When will you need it?
[01:29:22.181 --> 01:29:24.382]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:29:24.382 --> 01:29:25.723]  Will there be any food?
[01:29:25.723 --> 01:29:27.244]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:29:27.244 --> 01:29:28.304]  If there's a quarantine,
[01:29:28.464 --> 01:29:29.786]  And you can't feed yourself?
[01:29:29.786 --> 01:29:32.509]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:29:32.509 --> 01:29:36.113]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:29:36.113 --> 01:29:39.917]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:29:39.917 --> 01:29:41.159]  How much will you need?
[01:29:41.159 --> 01:29:42.060]  We don't know.
[01:29:42.060 --> 01:29:43.161]  How much do you want?
[01:29:43.161 --> 01:29:43.902]  All you can get.
[01:29:43.902 --> 01:29:44.903]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:29:45.163 --> 01:29:48.227]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:29:48.227 --> 01:29:50.009]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:29:50.009 --> 01:29:50.910]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.

[01:30:04.643 --> 01:30:07.504]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:30:07.504 --> 01:30:08.784]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[01:30:08.784 --> 01:30:09.604]  It's very real.
[01:30:09.604 --> 01:30:11.845]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:30:11.845 --> 01:30:13.486]  And it's available right now to you.
[01:30:13.486 --> 01:30:17.967]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[01:30:48.324 --> 01:30:50.245]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[01:31:00.336 --> 01:31:04.879]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:04.879 --> 01:31:05.800]  Number one.
[01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:09.222]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:09.222 --> 01:31:10.082]  Number two.
[01:31:10.082 --> 01:31:14.985]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:14.985 --> 01:31:15.726]  It's true.
[01:31:15.726 --> 01:31:20.269]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:20.589 --> 01:31:21.410]  Number 3.
[01:31:21.410 --> 01:31:24.993]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:24.993 --> 01:31:28.916]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:28.916 --> 01:31:29.716]  Number 4.
[01:31:29.716 --> 01:31:32.478]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:32.478 --> 01:31:36.161]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:36.161 --> 01:31:36.942]  Number 5.
[01:31:36.942 --> 01:31:41.085]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:31:41.085 --> 01:31:45.849]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:31:46.129 --> 01:31:50.292]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:50.292 --> 01:31:52.094]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:52.094 --> 01:31:54.336]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:31:54.336 --> 01:31:56.677]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:32:02.042 --> 01:32:06.003]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:06.003 --> 01:32:14.866]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:32:14.866 --> 01:32:19.507]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.

[01:33:01.761 --> 01:33:05.369]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[01:33:05.369 --> 01:33:08.576]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:33:12.890 --> 01:33:14.070]  This is not impossible.
[01:33:14.070 --> 01:33:18.992]  I mean, we have more and more states, 30 plus, moving towards Tenth Amendment declarations.
[01:33:18.992 --> 01:33:22.653]  The media spins that like it's secession or something.
[01:33:22.653 --> 01:33:23.073]  It's not.
[01:33:23.073 --> 01:33:25.234]  It's declaring Tenth and Ninth Amendment.
[01:33:25.234 --> 01:33:32.336]  And we have those success stories and leaders at the state level that will speak out and will be bold.
[01:33:32.336 --> 01:33:38.658]  We can then catapult that movement also into Washington and accurately assess the criminals
[01:33:39.558 --> 01:33:43.759]  That we're facing, and so we do see some bright things happening.
[01:33:43.759 --> 01:33:43.999]  Right.
[01:33:43.999 --> 01:33:51.841]  What we've seen up until now is every time you start to see at the state and local level, people start to really stand up and lead.
[01:33:51.841 --> 01:33:54.141]  That way they get bought off.
[01:33:54.141 --> 01:33:58.382]  You know, the bankers are willing to throw an awful lot of money to buy a leader off.
[01:33:58.382 --> 01:33:59.562]  Or their girlfriend.
[01:33:59.562 --> 01:34:00.422]  Right.
[01:34:00.422 --> 01:34:04.683]  You know, they play the control file, they play the dirty trick, they play the entrapment.
[01:34:04.683 --> 01:34:08.184]  You know, there's all sorts of positive incentives and negative games they can play.
[01:34:08.843 --> 01:34:14.306]  And I think the question is, is there a way we can communicate and organize locally so that they can't?
[01:34:14.306 --> 01:34:25.012]  Because if you look at all the different laws that are happening right now, health care, food safety is a big one, census, all these things, we are across the constitutional line.
[01:34:25.012 --> 01:34:33.417]  And the important thing I want to make, really the important point everybody needs to get in their spirit is, these are the things that are destroying the economy.
[01:34:33.417 --> 01:34:37.479]  I mean, when you, it's like taking a horse or taking a boxer.
[01:34:37.958 --> 01:34:40.979]  And tying his hands and tying his legs and then putting in the ring.
[01:34:40.979 --> 01:34:42.239]  He's going to lose.
[01:34:42.239 --> 01:34:50.301]  So when you make this many rules and you overlay this much expense on small business, you kill the heart of the economy.
[01:34:50.301 --> 01:34:56.143]  And so all of this stuff is what's killing the economy.
[01:34:56.143 --> 01:34:59.344]  You turn that around and you can unleash incredible wealth.
[01:34:59.344 --> 01:35:01.344]  Let me give you a perfect example.
[01:35:01.344 --> 01:35:07.146]  Do you know who is the number one provider of services to the food stamp program in this country?
[01:35:07.757 --> 01:35:09.157]  Alex?
[01:35:09.157 --> 01:35:12.618]  Yes, it's Offshore Central Banks.
[01:35:12.618 --> 01:35:28.162]  It's JPMorgan Chase, and they outsource the data servicing to India, which means in Tennessee, which is one of the states where they provide the services, we now have 20% of our population on food stamps, okay?
[01:35:28.162 --> 01:35:37.144]  So, more than a million people on food stamps, and those people, many of them get unemployment checks or welfare checks, they get food stamps,
[01:35:37.651 --> 01:35:40.233]  And they sit around and we pay them not to work.
[01:35:40.233 --> 01:35:42.974]  Meantime, we have Bocoup, beautiful farmland.
[01:35:42.974 --> 01:35:45.536]  You know, the farmers can't find labor.
[01:35:45.536 --> 01:35:50.619]  Everybody's too busy, you know, dealing drugs or, you know, being on whatever government subsidy.
[01:35:50.619 --> 01:36:00.606]  And we've got the big agribusiness moving down into Latin America, controlling the agriculture, you know, shipping the food in.
[01:36:00.606 --> 01:36:02.407]  It's highly processed.
[01:36:02.407 --> 01:36:03.888]  It makes us sick.
[01:36:03.888 --> 01:36:05.329]  That's part of the health care problem.
[01:36:05.828 --> 01:36:27.315]  And so, and JPMorgan Chase is doing the servicing work, and the theory is that we can pay somebody in India or in Latin America to do something that the people who are getting those food stamps could do here, and it's cheaper to pay them not to work and then pay somebody else in Latin America to do the farming, and somebody in Asia to do the data servicing, and that's just not true.
[01:36:27.315 --> 01:36:28.895]  The numbers don't add up.
[01:36:28.895 --> 01:36:33.517]  And that's why if the state and local players can sit down and say,
[01:36:34.142 --> 01:36:40.968]  Okay, how can we re-engineer this, move all those jobs back to our state, do this on an economic basis?
[01:36:40.968 --> 01:36:50.395]  Where is the opportunity to create lots more cash flows into the local small businesses, lots more equity, lots more skills, lots more knowledge?
[01:36:50.395 --> 01:36:58.982]  You know, it's all there, but you're going to have to deal with, okay, we can't let the feds have control because they're literally draining our lifeblood.
[01:36:58.982 --> 01:36:59.883]  It's like a vampire.
[01:37:00.509 --> 01:37:22.488]  Well, I think the number one mission is to continue to point out there are criminals out in the open who won't say where trillions of dollars went, and then we find out it went to them personally, and they ordered the holding companies that they laundered the money through, like AIG, to not, in federal filings, tell the feds or the public that the very bankers running policy and government were the ones that were getting the money.
[01:37:22.488 --> 01:37:24.609]  I mean, a five-year-old can understand
[01:37:25.470 --> 01:37:28.953]  The reality is the change we're talking about
[01:37:54.164 --> 01:38:15.480]  Cannot be engineered at Washington, because we have created a financial mechanism that would allow us to borrow massive amounts of money globally, and so we've had massive amounts of money, and as long as the criminals could engineer that subsidy, this could keep going, and they could offer more money at cheaper prices, and we've been willing to go along with that.
[01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:18.082]  Now, do you remember my red button story?
[01:38:18.860 --> 01:38:20.401]  Yes, but I'll recap it.
[01:38:20.401 --> 01:38:25.585]  Okay, so I was giving a speech to a group of people called Spiritual Frontiers Foundation.
[01:38:25.585 --> 01:38:30.168]  They have a conference once a year to talk about how we can evolve our society spiritually.
[01:38:30.168 --> 01:38:32.630]  Very committed, dedicated people.
[01:38:32.630 --> 01:38:39.215]  I'm in the middle of the speech and explaining that the Department of Justice in 1999 had told a reporter I was working with that the U.S.
[01:38:39.215 --> 01:38:42.958]  economy launders $500 billion to a trillion dollars a year of all dirty money.
[01:38:42.958 --> 01:38:48.362]  So, not just narcotics trafficking, but illegal gambling, tax evasion, financial fraud, everything.
[01:38:48.775 --> 01:38:51.719]  Okay, now with the financial fraud, it's much bigger.
[01:38:51.719 --> 01:38:53.702]  But at that time, $500 billion to a train.
[01:38:53.702 --> 01:39:01.893]  So I said to this wonderfully spiritual evolved audience, if you could push a red button to stop all hard narcotics trafficking in your community,
[01:39:02.688 --> 01:39:04.189]  I said, why would you not push the button?
[01:39:04.189 --> 01:39:07.151]  They said, we don't want our mutual funds to go down.
[01:39:07.151 --> 01:39:08.733]  We don't want our government checks to go down.
[01:39:08.733 --> 01:39:10.094]  But see, that's the scam!
[01:39:10.094 --> 01:39:11.475]  Justice be done!
[01:39:11.475 --> 01:39:13.496]  May the heavens fall!
[01:39:13.496 --> 01:39:18.120]  I mean, all of these parasitic systems cost more than they make, and they're wrong!
[01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:18.500]  Right.
[01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:31.950]  And so, what it's going to come down to is, we cannot, we've seen the Fed monetize the whole treasury and mortgage market last year, and so we can't, obviously you can't keep monetizing at this rate.
[01:39:32.409 --> 01:39:42.537]  And so now the day has come where the bell is ringing and saying, we can't get free money forever anymore, so something's got to give and we've got to change.
[01:39:42.537 --> 01:39:56.828]  And those changes are going to happen, Alex, in the places where our governors, our attorney generals, and our sheriffs can come together, assert 10th Amendment right, and now we're all going to have to support them in re-engineering the economic flows.
[01:39:56.828 --> 01:40:01.552]  But when it comes out the other side of the sausage maker, we're all going to have to be a lot more productive.
[01:40:03.083 --> 01:40:14.170]  Well, it is true that half the population is on some form of government dole or payment or job, and the government's only getting more aggressive, more parasitic, more militarized.
[01:40:14.170 --> 01:40:14.850]  Right.
[01:40:14.850 --> 01:40:20.914]  And what the cops and the bureaucrats don't understand is the bankers have already moved offshore.
[01:40:20.914 --> 01:40:23.915]  They're literally for three years been buying homes offshore.
[01:40:23.915 --> 01:40:28.278]  They believe they're probably going to lose control, but they've already run off with a bag of money.
[01:40:28.797 --> 01:40:30.818]  I think it is very, very important.
[01:40:30.818 --> 01:40:42.964]  I said in my year-end wrap-up, which I called the Year of the Giant Vampire Squid, the wonderful story from Rolling Stone, declared Goldman Sachs the giant vampire squid.
[01:40:42.964 --> 01:40:51.547]  Basically, what these guys did, Alex, in the 90s and early 2000s, they moved trillions of dollars out of this country, a lot of it illegal.
[01:40:51.547 --> 01:40:56.930]  To do that, they issued massive fraudulent securities and derivatives, and what this bailout did was
[01:40:57.555 --> 01:40:59.457]  It refinanced them out of the fraud.
[01:40:59.457 --> 01:41:10.385]  And so, they have pulled off not only the financial coup d'etat, but pushing the liabilities for the fraudulent securities they issued to do it back onto the taxpayers.
[01:41:10.385 --> 01:41:19.311]  And they're moving their base of operations to China and openly bad-mouthing America and saying it's not a good place to invest to further depress it so they can buy everything up.
[01:41:19.311 --> 01:41:22.474]  The door is not completely shut.
[01:41:22.474 --> 01:41:26.677]  A Geisler investigation and indictment, because we now have
[01:41:27.205 --> 01:41:42.494]  Remember, we have guys that are saying, oh, you know, I proposed a deal where I didn't give Goldman Sachs 100 cents on the dollar, and they said they were fully hedged, so they didn't care, and they'd rather see it default, and they'd pick it up on the other side.
[01:41:42.494 --> 01:41:49.939]  And we now have the Goldman CEO and Chairman saying in testimony today, well, wait a minute, you know, nobody offered me that deal.
[01:41:49.939 --> 01:41:52.000]  So one of them has got to be lying.
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:53.401]  So we now have pitted
[01:41:53.908 --> 01:41:57.469]  The Secretary of the Treasury and the Chairman of the Goldman Sachs and one has got to be lying.
[01:41:57.469 --> 01:42:08.392]  So if you can turn this into, you know, testimony under oath investigation, you know, you can still open a door and unravel this whole thing.
[01:42:08.392 --> 01:42:17.294]  So it is not, you know, it's never, it's never since I'm a big woman, I hate to say it, it's never over till the fat lady thinks, but it's never over till the fat lady thinks.
[01:42:17.294 --> 01:42:20.215]  So I think that, I think you're hammering on the Geithner.
[01:42:20.894 --> 01:42:30.773]  And a possible Geithner indictment is very, very important, because let me tell you, it is inconceivable to me that Geithner is not criminally liable for what's happened.
[01:42:31.328 --> 01:42:43.811]  Well, we have to pierce this veil of infallibility and, and, and, and potpourri, or whatever you want to call it, where the elites just stumble around in fancy suits with SWAT teams around them saying, I will rob this, I will rob that.
[01:42:43.811 --> 01:42:46.191]  Everyone just, just bows down to them.
[01:42:46.191 --> 01:42:56.653]  And the image of these criminals being indicted or in trouble, like Watergate, these crimes are a trillion times that, literally, could bring them down just like Copenhagen went down.
[01:42:56.653 --> 01:42:58.694]  You know, the whole Copenhagen thing went down in flames.
[01:43:02.276 --> 01:43:06.298]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:43:06.298 --> 01:43:09.539]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:43:09.539 --> 01:43:14.321]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:43:14.321 --> 01:43:20.743]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:43:20.743 --> 01:43:22.964]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:43:23.504 --> 01:43:24.986]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:43:24.986 --> 01:43:26.267]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:43:26.267 --> 01:43:28.510]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:43:42.406 --> 01:43:46.790]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[01:43:46.790 --> 01:43:49.673]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[01:44:09.031 --> 01:44:13.477]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.

[01:45:01.465 --> 01:45:04.467]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:45:04.467 --> 01:45:09.792]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:45:09.792 --> 01:45:11.853]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:45:11.853 --> 01:45:16.857]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:45:16.857 --> 01:45:17.758]  How much do you want?
[01:45:18.018 --> 01:45:19.139]  When do you want it?
[01:45:19.139 --> 01:45:21.020]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:45:21.020 --> 01:45:22.101]  When will you need it?
[01:45:22.101 --> 01:45:24.303]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:45:24.303 --> 01:45:25.644]  Will there be any food?
[01:45:25.644 --> 01:45:27.165]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:45:27.165 --> 01:45:32.449]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:45:32.449 --> 01:45:36.032]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:45:36.032 --> 01:45:39.495]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:45:39.835 --> 01:45:41.056]  How much will you need?
[01:45:41.056 --> 01:45:41.957]  We don't know.
[01:45:41.957 --> 01:45:43.078]  How much do you want?
[01:45:43.078 --> 01:45:43.999]  All you can get.
[01:45:43.999 --> 01:45:45.100]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:45:45.100 --> 01:45:48.143]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[01:47:03.385 --> 01:47:05.446]  Direct from Austin.
[01:47:05.446 --> 01:47:08.649]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:47:22.583 --> 01:47:24.764]  Ladies and gentlemen, this isn't a joke.
[01:47:24.764 --> 01:47:25.524]  This isn't a game.
[01:47:49.275 --> 01:47:52.557]  I mean, I've been doing this for 16 years, over 14 years on air.
[01:47:52.557 --> 01:48:06.023]  And when I watch video clips of every single czar, I just randomly look up one of Obama's czars, I type in communism, I type in Mao Zedong, I type in restrictions on free speech.
[01:48:06.023 --> 01:48:06.704]  Do it yourself!
[01:48:07.384 --> 01:48:08.445]  And everyone.
[01:48:23.423 --> 01:48:25.885]  And every one of them loves Mao.
[01:48:25.885 --> 01:48:30.807]  Every, and we were listing them earlier in the week, every one of them loves communism.
[01:48:30.807 --> 01:48:35.510]  Every one of them says we're going to restrict free speech and arrest people.
[01:48:35.510 --> 01:48:44.275]  And Cass Sunstein, one of the most powerful czars over all federal regulations, he interprets federal law and then implements it however he wants.
[01:48:44.275 --> 01:48:48.458]  We've spent the last two weeks, as you know, day after day just reading his quotes, playing video clips.
[01:48:49.284 --> 01:48:52.728]  There is no Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
[01:48:52.728 --> 01:48:53.829]  There is no free speech.
[01:48:53.829 --> 01:48:56.551]  He wants to arrest you for conspiracy theories.
[01:48:56.551 --> 01:48:58.253]  And then he lists them.
[01:48:58.253 --> 01:49:04.159]  He said, if you don't believe that global warming is man-made and deadly, you need to be arrested.
[01:49:04.159 --> 01:49:05.220]  You need to be banned.
[01:49:05.220 --> 01:49:08.864]  I mean, he wrote this for Chicago Law School a year and a half ago.
[01:49:09.756 --> 01:49:13.199]  I mean, I can't believe it!
[01:49:13.199 --> 01:49:27.092]  And so I read, while I was reading all this about our czars, I saw a member of European Union Parliament, Godfrey Bloom, basically putting press releases out going, oh my God, I've had a chance to interview the bureaucracy czars that really run everything.
[01:49:27.092 --> 01:49:28.954]  We have no power over them and they're all
[01:49:30.609 --> 01:49:35.312]  Folks, communists killed hundreds of millions of people, over 100 million conservatively.
[01:49:35.312 --> 01:49:36.613]  These people don't play games.
[01:49:36.613 --> 01:49:40.496]  They take your farm, they take your ranch, they put you in labor camps.
[01:49:40.496 --> 01:49:49.141]  In fact, at the end of the show, I'm going to play about 15 minutes from a British-slash-German documentary that interviewed survivors of North Korean camps.
[01:49:49.141 --> 01:49:50.642]  And they do this on purpose.
[01:49:50.642 --> 01:49:52.043]  They have a system.
[01:49:52.043 --> 01:49:55.065]  And literally, I mean, I saw
[01:49:57.421 --> 01:49:58.262]  And we're going to our guest.
[01:49:58.262 --> 01:49:59.102]  I start ranting.
[01:49:59.102 --> 01:50:07.490]  I saw two weeks ago Hardball Chris Matthews say his idol is Saul Alinsky.
[01:50:07.490 --> 01:50:10.012]  Saul Alinsky is called the communist communist.
[01:50:10.012 --> 01:50:12.013]  He wrote about putting us in labor camps.
[01:50:12.013 --> 01:50:16.497]  I mean, you've got all these rich bureaucrats saying they're going to put us in labor camps.
[01:50:17.677 --> 01:50:26.201]  You know, I think that's the one thing they've got over us, Mr. Bloom, is that they're so evil, they don't have a little mustache like Hitler or a mustache like Stalin.
[01:50:26.201 --> 01:50:40.587]  We have those archetypal images from, you know, 50, 60 years ago that we now can't recognize our generation of tyrants because they're a bunch of lip-wristed pansies hopping around, but they've got the police working for them and the tax man.
[01:50:40.587 --> 01:50:41.728]  These are dangerous people.
[01:50:42.994 --> 01:50:50.277]  Yes, you've hit the nail right on the head there, Alex, because it is the fact that they are so desperately plausible.
[01:50:50.277 --> 01:50:51.498]  They're quite obeyed.
[01:50:51.498 --> 01:50:53.758]  These guys aren't swivel-eyed lunatics.
[01:50:53.758 --> 01:50:57.200]  These guys sit there and look pretty plausible, and I've got a list in front of me.
[01:50:57.200 --> 01:51:04.843]  Our President, Broseph, the President of the Parliament was a former Maoist Communist Party in Portugal.
[01:51:06.029 --> 01:51:06.870]  I've got a whole list.
[01:51:06.870 --> 01:51:09.332]  This isn't top secret stuff.
[01:51:09.332 --> 01:51:11.634]  These people are open, upfront communists.
[01:51:20.560 --> 01:51:23.283]  I have always been, and make no apology for it.
[01:51:23.283 --> 01:51:39.378]  But the thing is, they are urbane, they are plausible, and of course, nobody's interested from the press, because the press have been bought, body and soul, on the BBC, by people who are all, if I may use a little bit of a crudit here, they all piss in the same pot, Alex.
[01:51:40.339 --> 01:51:41.820]  They certainly do.
[01:51:41.820 --> 01:51:48.262]  And again, I want to get your take on all of this instead of ranting myself and backing up what you're saying.
[01:51:48.262 --> 01:51:52.823]  Again, the public's starting to wake up to just how diabolical, and that's the word, they are diabolical.
[01:51:52.823 --> 01:52:00.886]  And I've seen the London Guardian and Mombiot and all of them saying it's treason to deny man-made climate change.
[01:52:00.886 --> 01:52:01.606]  Death penalty!
[01:52:02.667 --> 01:52:18.823]  These guys are all against the death penalty for a child rapist or a murderer but they love talking about arresting us and imprisoning us and in some cases executing us if we deny their global religion of communism.
[01:52:18.823 --> 01:52:24.908]  Can you speak specifically to the European Union and others trying to pass more and more laws to restrict free speech?
[01:52:25.983 --> 01:52:26.744]  Yes.
[01:52:26.744 --> 01:52:35.430]  It's interesting that the British system and the American system is extremely similar, is that we don't have a prescriptive legislative system.
[01:52:35.430 --> 01:52:42.676]  Basically, a free-born Englishman, an American, pretty well do what they like if it isn't actually banned by law.
[01:52:42.676 --> 01:52:44.617]  Now, I mentioned this on your last show.
[01:52:44.617 --> 01:52:46.779]  When I was on the show last, you very kindly invited me.
[01:52:46.779 --> 01:52:50.602]  The Corpus Juris system, or sometimes known as the Napoleonic Code,
[01:52:51.082 --> 01:52:53.965]  Tells the citizen that which he may do.
[01:52:53.965 --> 01:52:56.528]  And that is a fundamental change.
[01:52:56.528 --> 01:53:03.655]  So, they have a rule book to say, this is what you may do, this is what you may not do.
[01:53:03.655 --> 01:53:06.698]  So consequently, they always have the upper hand.
[01:53:06.698 --> 01:53:08.921]  The legal system always has the upper hand.
[01:53:09.481 --> 01:53:32.492]  And of course, if you look at that prescriptive system, and you see that over 50% of all the commissars who actually head up the bureaucracies of the European Union, and 75% of our laws of all countries, not just Great Britain, all countries, are made by the place from which I'm speaking at the moment, you know, this is how we're totally and utterly wrapped up.
[01:53:32.492 --> 01:53:38.255]  And people just don't know and don't understand that these characters are dominating every aspect of their lives.
[01:53:40.143 --> 01:53:52.426]  And again, just briefly for those that don't understand this European Union bureaucracy, because they're setting up a similar quasi-governmental one, more of a corporate brand of it here, with all this bureaucratic power.
[01:53:52.426 --> 01:53:53.766]  You're in France right now.
[01:53:53.766 --> 01:54:03.469]  Describe the different capitals and different bureaucracies, and how was the power originally vested in these unelected pirates?
[01:54:03.469 --> 01:54:05.969]  I mean, explain that in a nutshell for people, please, sir.
[01:54:05.969 --> 01:54:09.450]  Well, it's basically, it's really sort of mission creep.
[01:54:09.930 --> 01:54:10.430]  I don't know.
[01:54:29.802 --> 01:54:36.129]  Slowly, but surely, and relentlessly, to a super state, a super state that we have now.
[01:54:36.129 --> 01:54:46.321]  Run by committees, the committees form the law, and of course one of the sad things that we've lost in the United Kingdom, which is something that you need, that you are, it's happening to you, I believe that it's happening to you.
[01:54:47.373 --> 01:54:50.115]  Is that we have lost our system of common law.
[01:54:50.115 --> 01:54:52.476]  We're now run by quangos.
[01:54:52.476 --> 01:54:53.997]  The United Kingdom is quango.
[01:54:53.997 --> 01:54:55.758]  I'm not sure that word is familiar in America.
[01:54:55.758 --> 01:55:04.803]  Well, it's administrative law where the bureaucracy just churns out new rules with no statutory force behind them.
[01:55:04.803 --> 01:55:05.924]  That's exactly right.
[01:55:05.924 --> 01:55:07.725]  And the powers that they have are extraordinary.
[01:55:07.725 --> 01:55:08.766]  Let me give an example.
[01:55:08.766 --> 01:55:10.747]  The Financial Service Authority in London.
[01:55:11.347 --> 01:55:17.894]  They can virtually kick down your door, they can close your business, they can do exactly as they like.
[01:55:17.894 --> 01:55:19.295]  There is no redress.
[01:55:19.295 --> 01:55:26.822]  You can't come back and say you've ruined my family's investment advisor practice with your shenanigans.
[01:55:26.822 --> 01:55:27.763]  There's no comeback.
[01:55:27.763 --> 01:55:32.488]  And it's the same with DEFRA, which is our agricultural enforcement agency.
[01:55:33.108 --> 01:55:35.631]  And we have a number of these agencies.
[01:55:35.631 --> 01:55:37.973]  So the law has been completely suspended.
[01:55:37.973 --> 01:55:40.435]  Of course, common law was a great thing.
[01:55:40.435 --> 01:55:51.025]  We gave a lot of the free world a magnificent legal system, not perfect, I'm not pretending it's perfect, it never was, but a pretty good one, all of which is now gone.
[01:55:51.565 --> 01:55:57.073]  Uh, and of course, if you take away the law, you take away the rights of the individual, and that's what's happened.
[01:55:57.073 --> 01:55:59.456]  But it hasn't happened in one bite-sized chunk.
[01:55:59.456 --> 01:56:00.597]  They weren't that stupid.
[01:56:00.597 --> 01:56:02.379]  They're not stupid enough to do it in a bite-sized chunk.
[01:56:02.379 --> 01:56:03.381]  Well, let's go back.
[01:56:03.381 --> 01:56:06.845]  In the BBC, of all places, they've had Bilderberg Group members like...
[01:56:07.466 --> 01:56:07.826]  I think?
[01:56:27.617 --> 01:56:50.058]  They said, ha ha, we set this up 50 years ago, now 53 years ago, in your face, and when Judicial Watch sued three years ago, this is in my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, when they sued, they got the internal SPP documents with Bush and everybody else meeting, and this Council of Private Corporations and Bureaucrats, and the first order of business was,
[01:56:50.638 --> 01:56:55.542]  North American integration by stealth through trade and security agreements.
[01:56:55.542 --> 01:57:05.429]  And so this is a dishonest conquest by a bureaucratic class funded by select monopoly capitalists who are not free market.
[01:57:05.429 --> 01:57:06.590]  It's the same model.
[01:57:06.590 --> 01:57:09.152]  We've been in the North American Union since 2005.
[01:57:09.152 --> 01:57:10.012]  We have the documents.
[01:57:10.012 --> 01:57:11.733]  The general public doesn't even know.
[01:57:11.733 --> 01:57:15.056]  You've been in your EU, at least on paper, since 57.
[01:57:15.056 --> 01:57:16.537]  They didn't tell you it was happening until 99, 2000.
[01:57:18.058 --> 01:57:21.681]  And then expanding on from there, we defeat Copenhagen.
[01:57:21.681 --> 01:57:23.402]  The countries don't sign on to it.
[01:57:23.402 --> 01:57:27.125]  And Gordon Brown and Barack Obama and the EU say, don't worry.
[01:57:27.125 --> 01:57:29.287]  Herman Von Ruppe, they say, don't worry.
[01:57:29.287 --> 01:57:30.869]  We already had this power.
[01:57:30.869 --> 01:57:33.711]  We're going to start registering everybody's carbon globally.
[01:57:33.711 --> 01:57:41.177]  And we're going to take U.S., British, and European tax money and start shoveling it into this global government, calling it global government.
[01:57:41.177 --> 01:57:44.580]  I mean, this is a completely illegitimate criminal enterprise.
[01:57:51.019 --> 01:57:55.121]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[01:57:55.121 --> 01:57:58.002]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:57:58.002 --> 01:57:59.263]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[01:57:59.263 --> 01:58:00.083]  It's very real.
[01:58:00.083 --> 01:58:02.324]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:58:02.324 --> 01:58:03.985]  And it's available right now to you.
[01:58:03.985 --> 01:58:08.307]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[01:58:50.748 --> 01:58:55.291]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:55.291 --> 01:58:56.211]  Number one.
[01:58:56.211 --> 01:58:59.634]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:59.634 --> 01:59:00.494]  Number two.
[01:59:00.494 --> 01:59:05.377]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:05.377 --> 01:59:06.118]  It's true.
[01:59:06.118 --> 01:59:11.001]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:11.001 --> 01:59:11.521]  Number three.
[01:59:11.801 --> 01:59:15.404]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:59:15.404 --> 01:59:19.307]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:19.307 --> 01:59:20.108]  Number 4.
[01:59:20.108 --> 01:59:22.870]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:59:22.870 --> 01:59:26.554]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:26.554 --> 01:59:27.354]  Number 5.
[01:59:27.354 --> 01:59:31.498]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:59:31.498 --> 01:59:36.262]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
