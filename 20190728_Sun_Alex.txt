[00:00.000 --> 00:18.280]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[00:18.280 --> 00:35.160]  so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones ladies and
[00:35.160 --> 00:39.320]  gentlemen Trump is moving and moving in a big way against the deep state on
[00:39.320 --> 00:43.200]  Friday in a press conference he said there should be criminal investigation of
[00:43.200 --> 00:47.120]  Obama and Hillary for their deep state activities trying to overthrow his
[00:47.120 --> 00:51.000]  election that's called attempted overthrow the government it's called
[00:51.000 --> 00:58.920]  high treason then Congressman John Ratcliffe did the rounds in the last two
[00:58.920 --> 01:03.440]  days on Fox News you name it saying there's gonna be criminal charges coming
[01:03.440 --> 01:08.040]  for a lot of high-level people that's a big deal but how big was it then when
[01:08.040 --> 01:18.440]  Trump 15 minutes ago tweeted this out I am pleased to announce that highly
[01:18.440 --> 01:21.600]  respected Congressman John Ratcliffe of Texas will be nominated by a media
[01:21.600 --> 01:26.120]  director of national intelligence a former US attorney John will lead and
[01:26.120 --> 01:30.280]  inspire greatness the country loves Dan Coates the current director will be
[01:30.280 --> 01:37.160]  stepping down now the word is coats helped with the whole ongoing cover-up
[01:37.160 --> 01:41.880]  but lied to Trump's face was general Rogers former head of the NSA that first
[01:41.880 --> 01:46.240]  warned Trump when he was president-elect this is beyond bombshell
[01:46.240 --> 01:50.920]  information and I was already up here three hours ago don't normally get up
[01:50.920 --> 01:55.160]  for three hours for the show I get ready at home I was up here three hours ago
[01:55.160 --> 01:59.480]  with a whole stack on the fact that Trump is pushing for criminal indictments
[01:59.480 --> 02:04.120]  does it mean it's gonna happen probably but it means that things are gonna heat
[02:04.120 --> 02:07.920]  up big time everybody better be frosty and have their fingers crossed to get
[02:07.920 --> 02:12.640]  down their knees to little baby Jesus because this is a very serious time to
[02:12.640 --> 02:16.200]  be alive enough to tell you that and we've got clips of what the president's
[02:16.200 --> 02:19.880]  been saying about this and more he hinted at it more than hinted he said
[02:19.880 --> 02:24.440]  there should be basically criminal investigation into Obama and Hillary in a
[02:24.440 --> 02:28.680]  press conference Friday here's part of that we want to find out what happened
[02:28.680 --> 02:34.080]  with the last Democrat president let's look into Obama the way they've looked
[02:34.080 --> 02:39.480]  at me from day one they've looked into everything that we've done they could
[02:39.480 --> 02:43.840]  look into the book deal that President Obama made let's subpoena all of his
[02:43.840 --> 02:48.760]  records let's subpoena all of the records having to do with Hillary Clinton and
[02:48.760 --> 02:52.600]  all of the nonsense that went on with Clinton and her foundation and
[02:52.600 --> 02:56.760]  everything else we could do that all day long frankly the Republicans were
[02:56.760 --> 03:03.440]  gentlemen and women when we had the majority in the house they didn't do
[03:03.440 --> 03:07.240]  subpoenas all day long they didn't do what they what these people have done what
[03:07.240 --> 03:10.760]  they're doing is a disgrace so destructive to our country and I think
[03:10.760 --> 03:14.800]  that's why we're going to take back the house that's why we're easily going to
[03:14.800 --> 03:20.240]  hold the presidency and we're going to continue to hold the Senate and you know
[03:20.240 --> 03:24.200]  people don't say but we picked up two seats of the Senate we went from 51 to
[03:24.200 --> 03:30.240]  53 in the 18 election nobody says they talk about the house and I didn't get
[03:30.240 --> 03:33.520]  the campaign very much for the house I couldn't because we were campaigning for
[03:33.520 --> 03:39.280]  the Senate we almost picked up five seats you know that very well so it's a
[03:39.280 --> 03:43.680]  disgrace that they're doing it they're doing it for political reasons and most
[03:43.680 --> 03:48.840]  of them many of them are admitting that it's politics and frankly it's a very
[03:48.840 --> 03:55.440]  sad thing for our country yes Trump has been surrounded Trump has been demonized
[03:55.440 --> 04:00.920]  he's been lied about he's been obstructed but he's really getting his heels in
[04:00.920 --> 04:06.360]  now he's really his tires are not spinning anymore they're they're they're
[04:06.360 --> 04:09.840]  catching on to the ground here he's getting real friction and moving
[04:09.840 --> 04:17.160]  forward the problem is the internet and Facebook and Twitter and YouTube are
[04:17.160 --> 04:22.080]  conservatively when it comes to politics hundreds of times bigger than all
[04:22.080 --> 04:28.920]  cable news combined I mean routinely before they banned us shadow banned us
[04:28.920 --> 04:33.520]  three years ago than totally ban us last year we had videos with 50 million 40
[04:33.520 --> 04:38.240]  million views every week average video million views it is insane and
[04:38.240 --> 04:44.320]  everybody else had that it's all gone more than 200,000
[04:45.320 --> 04:51.160]  it's worse than that that I said 200,000 or the 200 million people on
[04:51.160 --> 04:56.400]  Facebook and Instagram got banned today that follow Trump he'll never even know
[04:56.400 --> 05:03.520]  about it it's all coming up before I started working at info wars I was not
[05:03.520 --> 05:08.080]  only a fan of Alex Jones and in force dot com but also the products at info
[05:08.080 --> 05:11.560]  or store dot com and there's one product that's offered at info or store dot
[05:11.560 --> 05:16.320]  com that is the elite of the supplements and that's DNA Force plus now I
[05:16.320 --> 05:19.400]  remember when Alex first started talking about this with some of his special
[05:19.400 --> 05:24.680]  guests telomeres and telomere support with your DNA and so I started to look
[05:24.680 --> 05:29.480]  into the science and what telomeres were and how it can improve your health
[05:29.480 --> 05:33.800]  and longevity when you protect your telomeres so I started looking into DNA
[05:33.800 --> 05:39.200]  Force plus but it's expensive why because it is an elite supplement and then I
[05:39.200 --> 05:43.080]  started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive supplements for
[05:43.080 --> 05:48.840]  telomere support and they came and they went but DNA Force plus is still there
[05:48.840 --> 05:53.080]  it is the elite supplement I get excited when DNA Force plus is on sale
[05:53.080 --> 05:58.080]  because I know it's expensive so you should take advantage of 50% off DNA
[05:58.080 --> 06:02.280]  Force plus at infowarstore.com
[06:06.840 --> 06:12.920]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones coming
[06:12.920 --> 06:19.360]  to you live from the front lines of the info war all right ladies and gentlemen
[06:19.360 --> 06:24.520]  history is happening right now there have been a series of events that have
[06:24.520 --> 06:30.040]  taken place in the last three days that are beyond historic they are bombshell
[06:30.040 --> 06:35.560]  bombshells John Ratcliffe the congressman from Texas has been nominated
[06:35.560 --> 06:41.780]  to head up all 17 US intelligence agencies coats who Trump has learned
[06:41.780 --> 06:45.560]  has been working against the restoration of the Republic a lot of evidence shows
[06:45.560 --> 06:50.040]  is being removed and why that is so important is he'll be able to now get
[06:50.040 --> 06:54.240]  into all the files and data on how Trump was illegally spied on we've already
[06:54.240 --> 06:59.600]  reversed engineered it it's already come out in federal court but now all of the
[06:59.600 --> 07:04.720]  crimes of Obama and Hillary illegally spying on candidate Trump spying on him
[07:04.720 --> 07:09.000]  when he was president elect then president then lying to Congress it's all
[07:09.000 --> 07:16.240]  coming out this is huge and the system is completely freaking out they are
[07:16.240 --> 07:21.400]  running around like chickens with their heads cut off just chirping and squeaking
[07:21.400 --> 07:27.280]  and squawking that Trump's a Nazi all the rest of this trying to create race
[07:27.280 --> 07:31.240]  riots or something none of its working numbers show that record numbers of
[07:31.240 --> 07:34.560]  black Americans and Hispanic Americans are supporting Trump a lot of
[07:34.560 --> 07:38.280]  incredible things are happening I'm gonna run through this this segment the
[07:38.280 --> 07:45.000]  good news the bad news is Trump has real blind spots and I was told this by
[07:45.000 --> 07:49.960]  people that know the president well three years ago and I've seen it in his
[07:49.960 --> 07:55.920]  speeches and the speech he gave a few weeks ago at the censorship summit on
[07:55.920 --> 08:00.760]  social media at the White House and I've seen further statements from him and
[08:00.760 --> 08:05.040]  you know I get Mr. President you're 73 and everything and you don't know how
[08:05.040 --> 08:09.080]  the internet really works but I'll explain something in the last three
[08:09.080 --> 08:14.000]  days more accounts have been lost on Facebook and Twitter of your bona fide
[08:14.000 --> 08:20.080]  supporters then you have on both of your Twitter's your Instagram and
[08:20.080 --> 08:28.160]  everything else 200 million followers on major accounts two of the accounts had
[08:28.160 --> 08:35.480]  70 million together 74 million together one had 47 million 130 million the sites
[08:35.480 --> 08:41.960]  were getting hundreds of millions of views of your damn videos you don't
[08:41.960 --> 08:47.000]  think they put you unfiltered on CNN MSNBC ABC News where they only have a
[08:47.000 --> 08:52.960]  million viewers maybe these little meme channels were bigger than Fox News but
[08:52.960 --> 08:56.560]  all the little fancy outfits and all the suits and all the consultants in that
[08:56.560 --> 09:04.400]  in sexuous douchebag that is that is the Republican establishment excuse my
[09:04.400 --> 09:09.120]  French here they don't want to compete with the internet we don't even want
[09:09.120 --> 09:14.760]  the campaign money we don't even want I never got a dime of it we don't we just
[09:14.760 --> 09:19.400]  don't want to live in a communist country and I was bigger than Fox News three
[09:19.400 --> 09:23.400]  years ago when they shadow banned me Matt Drudge is still bigger than Fox News
[09:23.400 --> 09:26.520]  because he has his own site that everybody has to go to which is good he
[09:26.520 --> 09:31.000]  came here three years ago to warn me to emergency get everybody off those sites
[09:31.000 --> 09:34.480]  before I got banned because he talked to a Supreme Court justice that told him
[09:34.480 --> 09:39.400]  it was coming and they've almost passed a bill and the House of Representatives
[09:39.400 --> 09:47.440]  right now bipartisan to give people $30,000 fines for memes I'm not joking
[09:47.440 --> 09:57.720]  go straight to jail ladies and gentlemen that's where this country has gone 15
[09:57.720 --> 10:02.960]  to 30 thousand dollar fines that's the same thing they passed in Europe last
[10:02.960 --> 10:07.560]  year my listeners thought I was making it up and didn't think it was real it's
[10:07.560 --> 10:16.840]  the law in Europe so let's stop right there I know for Trump watching Fox News
[10:16.840 --> 10:21.080]  and read the New York Times and having people show him clips of my show and
[10:21.080 --> 10:26.360]  you know things like that is how he gets the news and specifically if I scream
[10:26.360 --> 10:31.480]  at the president somehow that gets to him but the point is is that almost
[10:31.480 --> 10:37.080]  everyone else under the age of about 40 communicates over Instagram more than
[10:37.080 --> 10:42.480]  Facebook and the heads of Instagram resigned last year when they said
[10:42.480 --> 10:50.040]  Zuckerberg's gonna censor everybody and going to kill the platform so I'm gonna
[10:50.040 --> 10:56.560]  explain this again over 200 million followers I added it up when when I got
[10:56.560 --> 11:01.920]  reported on Friday at RT it was over 120 million two of the accounts alone 74
[11:01.920 --> 11:05.880]  million that's bigger than your Twitter bigger than your Instagram combined
[11:05.880 --> 11:12.640]  Mr. President is two of them are bigger than everybody you're able to reach and
[11:12.640 --> 11:16.120]  guess what little secret was almost everybody was getting what they got on
[11:16.120 --> 11:20.280]  Instagram because Instagram wanted to be big before Facebook bought it a few
[11:20.280 --> 11:24.800]  years ago and now Facebook is running it into the ground because Facebook buys
[11:24.800 --> 11:31.360]  up everything to kill competition it's a giant stinking cartel so in the second
[11:31.360 --> 11:36.360]  hour I'm gonna stop getting into this now and get into the good news in the
[11:36.360 --> 11:40.000]  second hour I'm gonna lay all the numbers out I'm gonna lay all the facts out
[11:40.000 --> 11:47.400]  and I'm gonna go over every bit of it but I see Trump at his White House event
[11:47.400 --> 11:52.080]  going well you know it was rigged in 2016 a lot of dead people voting a lot of
[11:52.080 --> 11:55.720]  eat league illegals and a lot of censorship but I still beat it I'll just
[11:55.720 --> 12:01.040]  campaign harder it's your followers there at those campaign events with fifty
[12:01.040 --> 12:04.520]  thousand people all streaming and everywhere and putting out videos they
[12:04.520 --> 12:08.120]  get a hundred million views Trump you've already got the fifty thousand people at
[12:08.120 --> 12:12.880]  your rally you want to use them as a giant media army to jack into everything
[12:12.880 --> 12:18.120]  which you had Hillary was arrogant back then they're not arrogant now the
[12:18.120 --> 12:23.240]  censorship Mr. President we're seeing right now is I don't know fifty thousand
[12:23.240 --> 12:28.120]  times worse than we saw before total shadow banning down to nothing we have
[12:28.120 --> 12:32.240]  a Twitter Facebook account but no one can see it or they go past that with
[12:32.240 --> 12:37.280]  total bans of my name and info wars and now they're saying the word Christian
[12:37.280 --> 12:40.600]  YouTube's officially sent letters out we have the letters in videos saying you
[12:40.600 --> 12:44.600]  can have Muslim outreach but churches can no longer advertise because
[12:44.600 --> 12:51.520]  Christian what's the word they use Christian does not follow the terms of
[12:51.520 --> 12:58.120]  service unacceptable content keyword Christian we have the official video
[12:58.120 --> 13:05.880]  oh hello well they're a private company they can do what they want oh yeah that
[13:05.880 --> 13:09.680]  has 90% of the search controls in the world and that is openly saying their
[13:09.680 --> 13:13.560]  top executive over quote all new projects that means she certifies that
[13:13.560 --> 13:17.040]  everything's politically correct and evil she certifies it instead of don't be
[13:17.040 --> 13:23.240]  evil that it is evil and she says on the veritas video we're gonna make sure he
[13:23.240 --> 13:27.840]  never gets reelected they're sitting there literally pissing in your face
[13:27.840 --> 13:32.960]  crapping on us and we're taking this illegal un-American cartel crap that
[13:32.960 --> 13:46.600]  that China blushes at unbelievable unbelievable unbelievable so Trump is either
[13:46.600 --> 13:52.640]  an idiot and he's so arrogant he believes he's Superman he's doing this all by
[13:52.640 --> 13:57.520]  himself hey Trump locked up in a jail cell how you gonna convince people what
[13:57.520 --> 14:01.040]  you're doing is right I love you Trump but it'd be like watching my father
[14:01.040 --> 14:06.120]  slit his own throat I'm gonna stop him or watching somebody you love short and
[14:06.120 --> 14:10.160]  cocaine or something listen to me I watch all your speeches you're like well

[16:43.120 --> 16:46.800]  or the turmeric or the bone broth thank you so much for the plugs but listen when
[16:46.800 --> 16:50.160]  people get the Patriot points a lot of times it makes things a loss later
[16:50.160 --> 16:53.640]  because if you're already getting 10% off because you're on auto ship then
[16:53.640 --> 16:57.120]  we're doing 50% off and then you do something like that we have Patriot
[16:57.120 --> 17:00.960]  points we lose money but that's okay thanks for the support last night I'm
[17:00.960 --> 17:06.360]  on info wars.com and I read Chris Pratt criticized for t-shirt choice it is
[17:06.360 --> 17:11.080]  literally the shirt that I envisioned a Betsy Ross but also another just
[17:11.080 --> 17:16.080]  classic American flag all 50 stars with the Gadsden snake superimposed over it
[17:16.080 --> 17:20.120]  and on the back America's back info wars.com but what's better than just an
[17:20.120 --> 17:23.320]  American flag about a don't tread on me under the flag take don't trail the
[17:23.320 --> 17:26.080]  American flag it's a perfect combo so great minds think alike I mean whoever
[17:26.080 --> 17:29.800]  designed that shirt we'd already come up with the exact same similar design it is
[17:29.800 --> 17:34.280]  the don't tread on me American flag t-shirt inspired by the triggering of
[17:34.280 --> 17:38.520]  leftist of the shirt worn by Chris Pratt but it's a you know battle tattered
[17:38.520 --> 17:41.760]  flag like the one that flew over Fort Sumter and again on the back it says
[17:41.760 --> 17:48.680]  America's back info wars.com 4,000 of these babies and that's it so we've got
[17:48.680 --> 17:53.320]  the Betsy Ross version and the American flag version at infowarstore.com be
[17:53.320 --> 17:57.320]  printed in the USA right now infowarstore.com they'll be right back the
[17:57.320 --> 18:02.600]  most banned broadcast in the world start to Marcus in New York Marcus you're on
[18:02.600 --> 18:06.160]  the air thanks for holding yeah I just want to say your show is a breath of
[18:06.160 --> 18:09.600]  fresh air I talked to a lot of people here out in New York City and one thing
[18:09.600 --> 18:13.360]  I could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars I think that the
[18:13.360 --> 18:17.320]  neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know
[18:17.320 --> 18:21.080]  that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the
[18:21.080 --> 18:24.920]  approaching 2020 that's it I mean if Trump buys into this it'll be the end of
[18:24.920 --> 18:27.440]  his presidency it's the only way I think he could be defeated other than
[18:27.440 --> 18:30.640]  assassinating him it's a time to be praying my friend I agree entirely and
[18:30.640 --> 18:33.560]  the last thing I just want to say Alex is I know they're trying to shut you down
[18:33.560 --> 18:37.920]  but the reinforcements have arrived man I would love to see you on air until
[18:37.920 --> 18:41.000]  you're 80 years old I'd love to see what you're talking about when you're 80 but
[18:41.000 --> 18:45.880]  if they do shut you down no you've gone into this war you won a lot of battles
[18:45.880 --> 18:49.320]  and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are gonna
[18:49.320 --> 18:53.080]  continue we're gonna keep fighting in the info war and even if something does
[18:53.080 --> 18:57.120]  happen to you or your show know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people
[18:57.120 --> 19:03.600]  fired up for liberty thank you sir for calling as we gather this evening in the
[19:03.600 --> 19:08.200]  joy of freedom we remember that all share a truly extraordinary heritage
[19:08.200 --> 19:13.320]  together we are part of one of the greatest stories ever told the story
[19:13.320 --> 19:19.120]  of America it is the epic tale of a great nation whose people have risked
[19:19.120 --> 19:25.600]  everything for what they know is right and what they know is true as long as
[19:25.600 --> 19:31.960]  we stay true to our cause as long as we remember our great history as long as we
[19:31.960 --> 19:37.800]  never ever stop fighting for a better future then there will be nothing that
[19:37.800 --> 19:42.240]  America can not do
[19:42.240 --> 19:55.520]  in full wars.com tomorrow's news today full power the Republic of the name of
[19:55.520 --> 20:01.800]  Jesus Christ full power damn the torpedoes go straight at him
[20:01.800 --> 20:25.720]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[20:25.720 --> 20:33.960]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance live from the
[20:33.960 --> 20:39.600]  info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones
[20:43.920 --> 20:49.560]  coming up next segment every major Democrat out there the AOC to Joe Biden
[20:49.560 --> 20:54.720]  said let's get physical let's have a physical war coming up next segment MSNBC
[20:54.720 --> 21:00.840]  tells Democrats we are at war with unindicted criminal Trump just a few
[21:00.840 --> 21:07.600]  days before that that was Friday days before that MSNBC said crush destroy
[21:07.600 --> 21:16.160]  their supporters go out and find them wow what a group of criminals there's so
[21:16.160 --> 21:25.200]  much more to get to but remember Barack Obama he got 65 million dollars rebooked
[21:25.200 --> 21:29.000]  it didn't even sell a couple million dollars and there's no discussion of
[21:29.000 --> 21:37.440]  that payoff and the president wants it looked into but what about all the
[21:37.440 --> 21:42.800]  illegal spying on the president what about all that what what about the lying
[21:42.800 --> 21:46.840]  to Congress what about the sellout to China and the sellout to Russia with
[21:46.840 --> 21:55.440]  uranium one what about Hillary Serber what about Obama working with communist
[21:55.440 --> 22:02.640]  and islamics in Kenya to overthrow his country where he's from where's dad's
[22:02.640 --> 22:08.200]  from I mean there's so many crimes funding ISIS funding al-Qaeda that will
[22:08.200 --> 22:13.200]  make your head spin and they sit there and like go through all of Trump's
[22:13.200 --> 22:15.880]  hundreds of lawyers and hundreds of properties and fines might didn't pay
[22:15.880 --> 22:20.040]  for their taxis for a decade that owed five million dollars and then that's
[22:20.040 --> 22:25.600]  Trump's fault no connection to it and they still can't find any dirt on Trump
[22:25.600 --> 22:30.760]  but Trump has this corrupt Justice Department that won't go after the
[22:30.760 --> 22:33.520]  Clintons and the Obama's because they all know where the bodies are buried
[22:33.520 --> 22:38.760]  well Trump's finally getting people in that are going to take action and John
[22:38.760 --> 22:43.520]  Ratcliffe says Attorney General William Barr will deliver justice to any
[22:43.520 --> 22:47.520]  Obama officials who committed crimes and they go on to say they have all the
[22:47.520 --> 22:53.560]  evidence they have all the documents they have all of the admissions and oh
[22:53.560 --> 23:02.160]  guess what that came out a day ago now today that was on July 27th on Saturday
[23:02.160 --> 23:07.160]  he said that now on July 28th Trump says about an hour ago I am pleased to
[23:07.160 --> 23:10.760]  announce the highly respected Congressman John Ratcliffe of Texas will be
[23:10.760 --> 23:15.240]  nominated by me to be the director of the National Intelligence for all 17
[23:15.240 --> 23:22.160]  agencies and below a former U.S. Attorney John will lead and inspire
[23:22.160 --> 23:30.360]  greatness for the country he loves Dan Coates is thrown out on his butt
[23:30.360 --> 23:35.320]  president said Dan Coates the current director will be leaving office on July
[23:35.320 --> 23:39.240]  15th I would like to thank Dan for his great service for country the acting
[23:39.240 --> 23:46.440]  director will be named shortly so it Trump's got a prosecutor from the
[23:46.440 --> 23:54.000]  Justice Department who also knows Congress about to go in there and run the
[23:54.000 --> 24:00.320]  operation out of all 17 agencies getting a white glove inspection and then
[24:00.320 --> 24:04.800]  all that being passed on to the Justice Department to dig out the traders
[24:04.800 --> 24:08.200]  inside the Justice Department that are working with the globalist the Chicoms
[24:08.200 --> 24:13.760]  and others the EU the big central banks all the robber barons will probably be a
[24:13.760 --> 24:17.360]  few Ruskies in there too I've just studied the whole thing there are some
[24:17.360 --> 24:22.160]  Rusky spies we've got spies over there but they do exist most of them buy off
[24:22.160 --> 24:28.520]  Democrats because everybody knows blue cities blue states are sellouts so there
[24:28.520 --> 24:34.280]  you go ladies and gentlemen Trump is about to do a major proctology exam on
[24:34.280 --> 24:39.040]  these individuals and they are going to be fighting back I said that on Friday
[24:39.040 --> 24:41.680]  when I called into my own show with Owen Schroder doing a great job co-hosting
[24:41.680 --> 24:46.400]  and I say it again today and this is what president Trump said on Friday but
[24:46.400 --> 24:52.280]  before we go to that I want to play what the new nominated head of all of the
[24:52.280 --> 24:57.840]  oversight group that oversees all 17 agencies the director of national
[24:57.840 --> 25:02.720]  intelligence that has all the oversight power by Congress invested in him a
[25:02.720 --> 25:08.160]  congressman now to be the head of that and a former prosecutor that's got to
[25:08.160 --> 25:12.760]  scare the hell out of the establishment so here's John Ratcliffe just yesterday
[25:12.760 --> 25:17.680]  telling you what's coming next so I mean the fact that you did have others
[25:17.680 --> 25:23.320]  writing the report and now we see that do you think people understand that Andrew
[25:23.320 --> 25:30.400]  Weisman was what a Hillary Clinton donor he was at her election party right it's
[25:30.400 --> 25:36.640]  not just Andrew Weisman Aaron Zebley represented Hillary Clinton's aid that
[25:36.640 --> 25:42.480]  set up the unsecure server and smashed her blackberries with with a hammer there
[25:42.480 --> 25:49.240]  were all sorts of folks again that were close to the Clinton Foundation and you
[25:49.240 --> 25:55.360]  know so the bias that was involved there I think are fair things to talk about and
[25:55.360 --> 25:59.960]  I think that's why that in light of the disastrous testimony from from Robert
[25:59.960 --> 26:03.960]  Mueller you know the Democrats paid a heavy price for bringing a reluctant
[26:03.960 --> 26:08.320]  witness to testify they overplayed their hand and they did it in front of the
[26:08.320 --> 26:12.960]  American people on a national television audience and it was just a train wreck of
[26:12.960 --> 26:16.720]  a week for the Democrats it was a great week for Donald Trump because of that but
[26:16.720 --> 26:21.440]  to your point Maria now the things that that Bob Mueller said he didn't know
[26:21.440 --> 26:25.840]  about and his team clearly didn't look at those are things that would be fair
[26:25.840 --> 26:30.880]  for Bill Barr and the Department of Justice to look at because we know that
[26:30.880 --> 26:35.440]  things happen in the Obama administration that haven't been answered
[26:35.440 --> 26:39.120]  there's been no accountability for that yet so I want to talk about and here's
[26:39.120 --> 26:44.000]  why things are different now Trump already knows all this stuff he knew
[26:44.000 --> 26:46.720]  that when Admiral Rogers head of the NSA came and told him three years ago when
[26:46.720 --> 26:52.120]  his president-elect but Trump has to go through the process and he doesn't
[26:52.120 --> 26:54.800]  violate national security rules even though he's the president has allowed
[26:54.800 --> 26:57.840]  to change them when he wants to in the executive it that's a very powerful
[26:57.840 --> 27:01.200]  position but the president is an elected dictator to a certain extent over the
[27:01.200 --> 27:05.640]  executive unless Congress removes him but he reportedly works for us to execute
[27:05.640 --> 27:09.240]  and he wants to start executing boy it'll look really bad for the
[27:09.240 --> 27:12.800]  establishment because they all committed giant crimes believing he never get an
[27:12.800 --> 27:16.240]  office then once he got an office they believed oh my god he's got to have some
[27:16.240 --> 27:19.600]  dirt on him let's find it to set him up while our Justice Department that will
[27:19.600 --> 27:23.800]  keep in charge sends him down the river but he wasn't corrupt and now your
[27:23.800 --> 27:27.560]  people are getting taken out of power and every day that clicks by you get in a
[27:27.560 --> 27:30.640]  worse position here's part of what the president again said on Friday at a
[27:30.640 --> 27:34.760]  press conference about it we want to find out what happened with the last
[27:34.760 --> 27:39.840]  Democrat president let's look into Obama the way they've looked at me from day
[27:39.840 --> 27:45.240]  one they've looked into everything that we've done they could look into the book
[27:45.240 --> 27:49.520]  deal that President Obama made let's subpoena all of his records let's
[27:49.520 --> 27:54.240]  subpoena all of the records having to do with Hillary Clinton and all of the
[27:54.240 --> 27:59.040]  nonsense that went on with Clinton and her foundation and everything else we
[27:59.040 --> 28:03.720]  could do that all day long frankly the Republicans were gentlemen and women when
[28:03.720 --> 28:09.880]  we had the majority in the house they didn't do subpoenas all day long they
[28:09.880 --> 28:12.760]  didn't do what they what these people have done what they're doing is a
[28:12.760 --> 28:16.560]  disgrace so destructive to our country and I think that's why we're gonna take
[28:16.560 --> 28:21.560]  back the house that's why we're easily gonna hold the president that's good
[28:21.560 --> 28:26.760]  except next hour mr. president I'm gonna lay out the computer scientists the
[28:26.760 --> 28:31.040]  head people from DARPA that have been exposing it the whistleblowers no you're
[28:31.040 --> 28:36.080]  not because they can clearly get 10 20 million people to vote and keep others
[28:36.080 --> 28:40.320]  from voting with their algorithms and systems and they're going to do it they
[28:40.320 --> 28:44.800]  were so arrogant in 2016 they only implemented part of it now they are we
[28:44.800 --> 28:50.840]  come back Democrats calling for violence calling for all-out war calling for

[34:04.840 --> 34:11.920]  that's in the poorest part of Baltimore Maryland where they literally treat the
[34:11.920 --> 34:16.240]  people worse than animals and then Elijah Cummings will play a video of him
[34:16.240 --> 34:21.400]  breaking down and crying and yelling and screaming at the head of the border
[34:21.400 --> 34:26.160]  patrol the head of ICE saying you're abusing you have children crapping in
[34:26.160 --> 34:29.360]  their diapers what's what kids do is they crap in their diapers you change them
[34:29.360 --> 34:32.960]  you dumb bastard excuse me lord nothing wrong with bastards I want to compare
[34:32.960 --> 34:39.560]  them to Elijah Cummings they're now saying that Trump is saying that black
[34:39.560 --> 34:48.840]  people are rats no Trump was clear as a clear blue sky he said stop saying the
[34:48.840 --> 34:57.640]  board patrols doing a terrible job clean up your own feted blue city we know blue
[34:57.640 --> 35:02.400]  cities by the piles of feces the homeless and the rats and the plague and
[35:02.400 --> 35:06.540]  they and the typhus and the and then the gangbanging and the shooting and the
[35:06.540 --> 35:13.920]  killing well they've all even a CNN host that's coming up next segment cries when
[35:13.920 --> 35:18.600]  they talk about it how mean everybody's been to Elijah Cummings saying that
[35:18.600 --> 35:28.440]  black people are rats is there no end to how deceptive the Democrats are we're
[35:28.440 --> 35:32.240]  killing people on the southern border we're making them drink out of toilets
[35:32.240 --> 35:37.520]  none of it's true they're coming and abusing the asylum system and there's
[35:37.520 --> 35:44.080]  new video play next segment of the border patrol and a checkpoint that is a
[35:44.080 --> 35:47.880]  approved asylum point I mean they were about a third of a mile away from the
[35:47.880 --> 35:51.120]  approved point but like the head of the former head of our patrol said you come
[35:51.120 --> 35:53.880]  turn yourself in for asylum and an approved point you could take it into
[35:53.880 --> 35:58.080]  custody and checked and then it gets reviewed and most people get to stay
[35:58.080 --> 36:02.440]  here we're the most wide open country in the world for that that turns into
[36:02.440 --> 36:06.440]  killing people the board patrol giving them food patent kids on the head loading
[36:06.440 --> 36:11.240]  them on the trucks they came to us but now the right wings all mad going oh my
[36:11.240 --> 36:15.040]  god you're supposed to you know throw them back over the fence it's the law we
[36:15.040 --> 36:22.320]  have to change the law but that video is coming up next segment as well of the
[36:22.320 --> 36:26.840]  people show up at the right general sector you know there's approved points
[36:26.840 --> 36:34.040]  of entry and they just let them in because they're in 120 degree temperatures
[36:34.040 --> 36:39.040]  and there's little kids with them and that's the policy in the law and they
[36:39.040 --> 36:43.840]  let them in now here's footage shot months ago of what people at night
[36:43.840 --> 36:49.640]  pouring across most of them in guns you name it it's just insane so that's all
[36:49.640 --> 36:55.560]  coming up the Elijah Cummings freaking out the border patrol footage where the
[36:55.560 --> 36:58.080]  people show up the general right area and they just let them in and pat them on the
[36:58.080 --> 37:04.720]  head and then the claims that Trump is saying black people are rats and that
[37:04.720 --> 37:10.840]  will be a new thing he doesn't just say that Mexicans are all criminals he says
[37:10.840 --> 37:16.480]  black people are rats and roaches flashback Bernie Sanders compares
[37:16.480 --> 37:21.720]  Baltimore to third-world country the rats the garbage the collapsing homes the
[37:21.720 --> 37:26.640]  burning cars but when Trump says it yeah there's the video I want to play right
[37:26.640 --> 37:32.920]  there I got crying I mean this is all insane but let me get to this right now
[37:32.920 --> 37:38.000]  the stories up on info wars.com it needs to be shared MSNBC tells Democrats we
[37:38.000 --> 37:46.200]  are at war with unindicted criminal Trump and they say it's time to stop
[37:46.200 --> 37:52.720]  playing by the rules whatever we have to do we're not going to necessarily play
[37:52.720 --> 37:59.520]  fair as if the Democrats that founded the KKK ever played fair they say that
[37:59.520 --> 38:06.400]  the American flag our first flag made by Betsy Ross who was like one of the head
[38:06.400 --> 38:09.760]  abolitionists in the country at the time you know the ones that ended slavery
[38:09.760 --> 38:14.240]  worldwide England was the first to do it came out of England abolitionism spread
[38:14.240 --> 38:20.920]  here they call that a slave flag again it's upside down world ladies and
[38:20.920 --> 38:26.120]  gentlemen and so that's how they operate so let's go ahead and play this
[38:26.120 --> 38:32.440]  incredible clip of where they say we're gonna start cheating oh like you started
[38:32.440 --> 38:37.640]  breathing and I love Donnie Deutch or whatever his stupid name is I mean what
[38:37.640 --> 38:42.080]  a punk man Trump will never be elected Trump will be out in six months all of
[38:42.080 --> 38:45.480]  it a lot of these people by the way have almost no ratings their average show has
[38:45.480 --> 38:51.960]  200,000 viewers before they shadow banned me on Facebook and Twitter my average
[38:51.960 --> 38:57.520]  live video had two million views Hillary lost they shadow banned me average
[38:57.520 --> 39:00.280]  video had a hundred thousand views then they totally banned me because you can't
[39:00.280 --> 39:04.760]  compete you schmucks no one wants to watch you Donnie Deutch no one wants to
[39:04.760 --> 39:09.440]  hear you everyone hates you except the few mental patients that watch your show
[39:09.440 --> 39:14.240]  or people tuning in to get the talking points to go out and lie so here he is
[39:14.240 --> 39:18.800]  and what you said in a couple minutes yesterday to me is the most important
[39:18.800 --> 39:23.800]  thing that's ever been said on this show he's almost like a show and that we are
[39:23.800 --> 39:30.760]  at war it is time for the Democrats to wake up we are playing against cheaters
[39:30.760 --> 39:38.840]  and liars are Steelers and with all due respect it was back in ten seconds you
[39:38.840 --> 39:41.480]  been at war with this country you're the globalist you're on the chai con payroll
[39:41.480 --> 39:45.760]  Hollywood zone by the chai comms MSNBC's parent company has billions of
[39:45.760 --> 39:52.280]  Chinese money coming in the new Tom Cruise movie coming out covered up
[39:52.280 --> 39:57.480]  Japanese and Taiwanese flags and a top gun too you're a foreign enemy you are
[39:57.480 --> 40:03.080]  the enemy boy and you're just oh it's time for us to say we're at war with
[40:03.080 --> 40:10.400]  the Trump you mean America you scumbag here he is to wake up we are playing
[40:10.400 --> 40:15.480]  against cheaters and liars or Steelers and with all due respect to Michelle
[40:15.480 --> 40:21.920]  Obama when they go high and when they go low we got to do whatever we have to
[40:21.920 --> 40:28.120]  do we actually have a government led by Moscow bitch and criminal Trump oh by
[40:28.120 --> 40:32.080]  the way we're gonna call him unindicted criminal Trump now because in two
[40:32.080 --> 40:37.360]  instances he has been an unindicted criminal so I know in in regular when
[40:37.360 --> 40:40.040]  you're playing fair you're supposed to call him President Trump just like what
[40:40.040 --> 40:44.080]  I call it Moscow Mitch we're gonna call him criminal Trump and another message
[40:44.080 --> 40:50.120]  for the Democrats it is time to move forward there are two takeaways from
[40:50.120 --> 40:55.080]  Mueller that we're gonna use as we go to war number one the president broke the
[40:55.080 --> 41:00.520]  law and when he's out of office he can go and we'll go to jail and number two
[41:00.520 --> 41:06.040]  we are vulnerable with our election systems that's our two things we may not
[41:06.040 --> 41:10.720]  have won the battle of impeachment but we're going to win the war of putting
[41:10.720 --> 41:14.360]  him in jail whatever we have to do and we're not gonna necessarily play fair
[41:14.360 --> 41:17.880]  and for all the intellectuals out there whose hair is gonna go on fire but
[41:17.880 --> 41:20.880]  we're becoming like them we're becoming like them
[41:20.880 --> 41:27.760]  cannot lose the next election we will go back 50 years but that's the problem is
[41:27.760 --> 41:33.400]  that they've been cheating all along and now Google and all of them are 200
[41:33.400 --> 41:38.480]  million accounts on Facebook and Instagram that supported the president all
[41:38.480 --> 41:43.760]  annihilated 200 million I wouldn't count them up it was reported on Friday it was
[41:43.760 --> 41:49.320]  like 120 million it's 200 million today as of three hours ago I spent 30 minutes
[41:49.320 --> 41:52.480]  going through and checking all these accounts and looking and adding the
[41:52.480 --> 41:59.000]  numbers up on a calculator a big old fat business calculator and I've shot an
[41:59.000 --> 42:04.160]  emergency report to the president 200 million followers that followed his
[42:04.160 --> 42:10.040]  pro accounts on Twitter I mean excuse me on Facebook and on Instagram gone but
[42:10.040 --> 42:13.920]  listen all of you watching on local TV stations all of you listening on the
[42:13.920 --> 42:18.000]  internet all of you at info wars.com and news wars.com you can overpower them
[42:18.000 --> 42:21.680]  today pick up the phone call 10 people and say they're censoring nationalistic
[42:21.680 --> 42:24.480]  conservatives they're pulling down American flags they're saying we
[42:24.480 --> 42:27.400]  shouldn't have American flags on campuses major universities are saying
[42:27.400 --> 42:30.720]  don't say America or American it's the new n-word and they're saying we can't
[42:30.720 --> 42:35.520]  have Alex Jones he's at info wars.com forward slash show he's at news wars.com
[42:35.520 --> 42:39.360]  you you're not gonna stop the American people or anybody around the world from
[42:39.360 --> 42:41.720]  what they want to listen what they want to hear because we built our own TV
[42:41.720 --> 42:45.560]  network we have our satellite feeds we have our crew and we're standing strong
[42:45.560 --> 42:48.800]  against this when everybody else is gonna be off the air before the election
[42:48.800 --> 42:53.160]  unless Trump does something my god they're calling for violent war they're
[42:53.160 --> 42:58.520]  saying shut everyone up and we put up with these thugs these getchers.
[42:59.280 --> 43:03.800]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena in the public
[43:03.800 --> 43:07.160]  square the other thing that's unique about info wars is it isn't the only
[43:07.160 --> 43:11.240]  network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate
[43:11.240 --> 43:14.800]  sugar daddy that's not backed by some billionaire that's not being funded by
[43:14.800 --> 43:17.960]  secrets foreign government it is completely independent of all that it
[43:17.960 --> 43:22.680]  is an old-school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the
[43:22.680 --> 43:26.160]  freedom of press and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so
[43:26.160 --> 43:29.600]  concerned with at the beginning of the country they actually tried to support and
[43:29.600 --> 43:33.320]  subsidize organizations just like this because this was the kind of press they
[43:33.320 --> 43:36.280]  wanted and then ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been
[43:36.280 --> 43:39.520]  co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been
[43:39.520 --> 43:43.360]  able to control and manipulate what news and views view a person's allowed to
[43:43.360 --> 43:47.320]  have or express or hear and the info wars audience has broken through that
[43:47.320 --> 43:51.720]  they are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate American
[43:51.720 --> 43:55.040]  democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught
[43:55.040 --> 44:09.240]  of the platforming defamation law fair and liable targeting you the most banned network in the world viewers and listeners I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you and we're under
[44:09.240 --> 44:13.720]  unprecedented evil attacks as you've seen but I wanted to take just a minute out here
[44:13.720 --> 44:17.520]  from the bottom of my heart to tell you how much it means to me that when you saw
[44:17.520 --> 44:21.520]  those lies against us last week the worst things you can say about people that you
[44:21.520 --> 44:24.320]  knew they were liars you went and looked it up and found out the truth and so I
[44:24.320 --> 44:28.920]  feel very strong and I feel God's hand on my shoulder and I feel your love in my
[44:28.920 --> 44:32.160]  heart I want you know that love is right back at you and I want to thank you for
[44:32.160 --> 44:35.600]  all you've done with your word of mouth and your prayers your financial support
[44:35.600 --> 44:40.200]  because I'm committed to fight to the end but I want to win and without you I'm
[44:40.200 --> 44:44.040]  gonna be destroyed and it's not gonna be fun but that's not what's important the
[44:44.040 --> 44:48.320]  enemy could win we're a key chess piece in this fight we're being used by God
[44:48.320 --> 44:52.080]  you're being used by God this is Providence so I salute you and I thank
[44:52.080 --> 44:54.880]  you for all you've done from the bottom of my heart
[44:54.880 --> 44:59.520]  Info Wars, the most banned network in the world
[45:00.520 --> 45:03.400]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York, Marcus here on the air, thanks for holding
[45:03.400 --> 45:06.720]  Hey Alex, yeah I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air
[45:06.720 --> 45:10.560]  I talked to a lot of people here out in New York City and one thing I can tell you is that
[45:10.560 --> 45:14.360]  almost nobody agrees with these wars I think that the Neocons are trying
[45:14.360 --> 45:18.200]  desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only
[45:18.200 --> 45:22.240]  way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching 2020
[45:22.240 --> 45:25.600]  that's it I mean if Trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's
[45:25.600 --> 45:28.520]  the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him it's a
[45:28.520 --> 45:31.400]  time to be praying my friend I agree entirely and the last thing I just want
[45:31.400 --> 45:34.960]  to say Alex is I know they're trying to shut you down but the reinforcements
[45:34.960 --> 45:38.960]  have arrived man I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old I'd

[45:42.000 --> 45:47.000]  down no you've gone into this war you've won a lot of battles and there are a lot
[45:47.000 --> 45:50.720]  of people like myself and many others who are gonna continue we're gonna keep

[47:07.120 --> 47:26.200]  all right I got to move fast in this segment as we're so jam-packed I'm
[47:26.200 --> 47:33.960]  Alex Jones we're live it's Sunday July 28 2019 hour number one's almost done but
[47:33.960 --> 47:37.440]  this is the most important segment of the hour Elijah Cummings is an
[47:37.440 --> 47:42.040]  authoritarian bully a monster as Trump has said he's a mob boss that runs
[47:42.040 --> 47:45.640]  Baltimore, Maryland as a king for decades it's well known Trump's right
[47:45.640 --> 47:48.760]  about that when he calls psycho Joe Scarborough a psycho it's because the
[47:48.760 --> 47:52.240]  dead intern was found with the brains bashed out in his office when he calls
[47:52.240 --> 47:55.120]  sleepy Joe sleepy it's because he's always falling asleep when he calls
[47:55.120 --> 47:58.840]  Hillary crooked it's because she's crooked low-energy Jeb he's got low
[47:58.840 --> 48:04.520]  energy now there have been the last three years since Trump got in hundreds of
[48:04.520 --> 48:09.560]  videos shot inside by AP Reuters you name it of how nice these facilities are
[48:09.560 --> 48:14.880]  sand volleyball courts we didn't have that when I was in my school soccer
[48:14.880 --> 48:20.680]  courts Xbox three meals a day all the snacks you can eat you can watch the
[48:20.680 --> 48:23.920]  reports that AP reports ice attention centers more like summer camp than
[48:23.920 --> 48:28.200]  concentration camps here's CNS news exclusive video tour of ice attention
[48:28.200 --> 48:33.680]  facility Xbox soccer free phone calls and lawyers that's because Elijah Cummings
[48:33.680 --> 48:39.000]  keeps saying that they're torturing kids that kids are dying but they're
[48:39.000 --> 48:43.840]  crapping in their diapers which is what kids do when it's totally overwhelmed so
[48:43.840 --> 48:47.160]  they put the men in the outside tents and the unaccompanied women children in
[48:47.160 --> 48:50.440]  really nice facilities that are bankrupting our country and people are
[48:50.440 --> 48:54.200]  pouring in wanting asylum trying to get in we've got a vet him and see who they
[48:54.200 --> 48:58.720]  are Ellis Island used to keep you six months we keep you two weeks they're the most open
[48:58.720 --> 49:01.840]  catcher in least the world's ever seen Trump wants that law change to stop this
[49:01.840 --> 49:05.640]  flood but they turned it into concentration camps draining out of
[49:05.640 --> 49:09.640]  toilets people dying here's Elijah Cummings flipping out the one of the
[49:09.640 --> 49:14.200]  heads of ice and then that's what Trump responded to just saying man take care of
[49:14.200 --> 49:19.320]  Baltimore dude it's literally Orkin says it's what the number two most
[49:19.320 --> 49:25.760]  rat-infested city in the country and just boarded up abandoned buildings
[49:25.760 --> 49:29.760]  everywhere it's as bad as Detroit many areas oh but instead of taking
[49:29.760 --> 49:34.260]  responsibility for another blue city being a cesspit oh oh you mean black
[49:34.260 --> 49:39.200]  people are rats and that's the CNN clips there's so many clips I can't get to
[49:39.200 --> 49:43.960]  them all CNN reporters crying I mean this is just insane but let's go to Elijah
[49:43.960 --> 49:47.120]  Cummings flipping out here it is
[49:47.120 --> 49:55.640]  when we hear about stories coming out from you and your agency that everything
[49:55.640 --> 49:59.960]  is pretty good and you doing a great job I guess you feel like you're doing a
[49:59.960 --> 50:04.200]  great job right and what you're saying we're doing our level best in a very
[50:04.200 --> 50:08.840]  time what does that mean what does that mean when a child is sitting in their
[50:08.840 --> 50:20.440]  own feces can't take a shower come on man what's that about none of us would
[50:20.440 --> 50:28.120]  have our children in that position they are human beings it's not the deed that
[50:28.120 --> 50:32.560]  you do to a child it's the memory it's the memory
[50:32.560 --> 50:37.880]  welcome on expert we are the United States of America we are the greatest
[50:37.880 --> 50:43.520]  country in the world we are the ones that can go anywhere in the world and
[50:43.520 --> 50:48.720]  save people make sure that they have diapers make sure that they have two
[50:48.720 --> 50:56.120]  brushes this makes sure that they're not laying around defecating in some silver
[50:56.120 --> 51:03.320]  paper some silver paper they use the few cage photos from Obama's era other
[51:03.320 --> 51:06.400]  countries they put you in a cage or they shoot your ass trying to come in here
[51:06.400 --> 51:10.600]  we kiss your ass and this bitching whining phoning this poverty pimp it's
[51:10.600 --> 51:13.360]  worth hundreds of millions of dollars since he swindles his way into Congress
[51:13.360 --> 51:17.080]  and you've got these places all falling apart everywhere Democrats are
[51:17.080 --> 51:22.840]  controlled way way a hundred times worse than these ice facilities literally and
[51:22.840 --> 51:27.480]  then they turn around and tell us we're bad now here's a two-minute
[51:27.480 --> 51:31.840]  compilation from AP reports and others your TV viewer it's very powerful it's
[51:31.840 --> 51:37.000]  up on informers.com the newswords.com showing even AP saying these are like
[51:37.000 --> 51:40.120]  summer camps British news saying these are like summer camps and then we were
[51:40.120 --> 51:44.120]  released 90% of the people other folks that are bank robbers rapists that we've
[51:44.120 --> 51:49.080]  gotten the system we send their ass back we got to pay that money but Cummings
[51:49.080 --> 51:52.720]  says we're torturing people in concentration camps well here's here's
[51:52.720 --> 51:55.680]  the good news Cummings nobody wants to get in your district nobody wants to get
[51:55.680 --> 52:02.120]  in a blue district here it is. The United States is running concentration camps on
[52:02.120 --> 52:09.080]  our southern border and that is exactly what they are. Two pairs of bunk beds in
[52:09.080 --> 52:13.400]  each bedroom and the living room. They are concentration camps. HHS provides the
[52:13.400 --> 52:18.120]  teens with six hours daily classroom instruction access to arts and crafts
[52:18.120 --> 52:22.800]  three meals a day and snacks access to call centers to reconnect with family
[52:22.800 --> 52:27.440]  then legal services and as the contractor running the holding facility
[52:27.440 --> 52:33.320]  describes most importantly they provide playtime. Is it schools sports day?
[52:33.320 --> 52:41.360]  Summer camp with freshly made beds eat all you can buffet and the inevitable
[52:41.360 --> 52:47.560]  video games. The fact that concentration camps are now an institutionalized
[52:47.560 --> 52:55.600]  practice in the home of the free is extraordinarily disturbing. Raise your
[52:55.600 --> 52:59.360]  hand if your government plan would provide coverage for undocumented
[52:59.360 --> 53:06.960]  immigrants. Some protesters replace three flags at the front of the facility
[53:06.960 --> 53:12.600]  with a Mexican flag and an upside-down US flag spray painted with abolish ice.
[53:12.600 --> 53:18.600]  You are more concerned with a f***ing piece of cloth than people who are
[53:18.600 --> 53:28.480]  marking cages to it right in front of you. There were American flags hanging
[53:28.480 --> 53:33.440]  all over these facilities that children being separated from their parents in
[53:33.440 --> 53:39.280]  front of an American flag. Mr. Speaker we do have a crisis at our border it is
[53:39.280 --> 53:44.760]  one of morality as we have seen this current strategy unfold intentional and
[53:44.760 --> 53:48.640]  cruelly created by the Trump administration. If you're not happy here
[53:48.640 --> 53:55.600]  then you can leave. White supremacist what you really mean is you're
[53:55.600 --> 53:59.400]  anti-white you're super racist but you want to be in a country founded by
[53:59.400 --> 54:03.640]  Europeans with Christian values not where there's open sewage and death and
[54:03.640 --> 54:06.800]  thousands of murders per town a year. There's a lot of great people every race
[54:06.800 --> 54:09.840]  color and creed they want to come here be Americans that's great you want to
[54:09.840 --> 54:12.840]  come here and say it sucks and jump around on Mali or whatever it is that
[54:12.840 --> 54:18.040]  ladies on where they took down the American flag ran up a Mexican flag and
[54:18.040 --> 54:25.760]  the city council helped do it in Colorado and Aurora look at this now look
[54:25.760 --> 54:29.720]  the board patrol follows the law they follow the current law they're working
[54:29.720 --> 54:38.000]  there all the time it's a horrible job KOLD 13 news showed what happened as
[54:38.000 --> 54:46.280]  asylum seekers showed up at the El Paso border sector they came right up the
[54:46.280 --> 54:50.720]  open area where there's no fence to officially show up where you asked for
[54:50.720 --> 54:58.880]  asylum they did what you're supposed to do 90% get released most never show up
[54:58.880 --> 55:04.800]  to the hearing and they were in minutes given water and food and medicine and
[55:04.800 --> 55:09.960]  checked and processed and and the right wing spun it look Trump's doing nothing
[55:09.960 --> 55:15.080]  it's wide open you've seen the former head chief last week I aired they were
[55:15.080 --> 55:18.360]  saying you make kids drink out of toilets you kill kids he blew up he said I've
[55:18.360 --> 55:21.760]  been there in the 18 wheelers you open them up there's 20 30 dead people and
[55:21.760 --> 55:25.560]  kids clutching their parents arms in the smell of those coyotes that killed them
[55:25.560 --> 55:30.680]  for no reason don't you tell me I'm killing kids you damn liar you show up
[55:30.680 --> 55:35.440]  at the checkpoint area they bring you in and you're not a criminal you're in the
[55:35.440 --> 55:42.560]  country and these damn liars sit up there here let's roll the video that's all
[55:42.560 --> 55:47.040]  over the news of oh look they're letting everybody in why do you think the other
[55:47.040 --> 55:50.520]  folks show up illegally into that because they're smuggling drugs because
[55:50.520 --> 55:53.360]  they've got kids that aren't theirs because they got Democrats telling them
[55:53.360 --> 55:56.800]  don't come in the normal way come to us you're undocumented so we can suck off
[55:56.800 --> 56:01.400]  of you go ahead and roll the audio and video
[56:03.040 --> 56:07.520]  the media spawn those look they're helping them up the hill no that's the
[56:07.520 --> 56:14.320]  opening to it that's the space that's where people are supposed to come do it
[56:14.320 --> 56:21.720]  she that's the third of a mile from the main checkpoint they were waving at them
[56:21.720 --> 56:26.880]  as they came across they weren't running they let them in that's the law not the
[56:26.880 --> 56:31.160]  border patrol you like this TSA sticking your hands down your pants while the
[56:31.160 --> 56:34.680]  borders open and while we pour in as long as I agree don't blame them blame
[56:34.680 --> 56:43.080]  Congress but then Eliza Cummings I never even had time to get to these clips but
[56:43.080 --> 56:45.720]  and I said I was getting the Trump in the censorship but I've got to get into
[56:45.720 --> 56:52.800]  these clips CNN saying that he's Trump's calling blacks rats when he said you
[56:52.800 --> 56:55.560]  ought to take care of your people and clean all that crap up and like Trump's
[56:55.560 --> 56:58.800]  really trying to actually get funding into those areas and this evil person
[56:58.800 --> 57:04.240]  says it's better to have rats than be a rat but first I want to play in the next

[59:58.360 --> 01:00:17.200]  good morning director if you'll let me quickly summarize your opening statement
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:20.440]  this morning you said in volume one on the issue of conspiracy the special
[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:23.960]  counsel determined that the investigation did not establish that
[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:27.080]  members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian
[01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:31.440]  government in its election interference activities and then in volume two for
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:34.880]  reasons that you explained the special counsel did not make a determination on
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:37.920]  whether there was an obstruction of justice crime committed by the
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:42.040]  president is that fair yes sir all right now in explaining the special counsel
[01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:45.160]  did not make what you called a traditional prosecution or declamation
[01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:51.640]  decision the report on the bottom of page two of volume two reads as follows the
[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:54.960]  evidence we obtained about the president's actions and intent presents
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:59.280]  difficult issues that prevent us from conclusively determining that no
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:03.160]  criminal conduct occurred accordingly while this report does not conclude that
[01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:08.400]  the president committed a crime it also does not exonerate him now I read that
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:13.840]  correctly yes all right now your report and today you said that all times the
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:17.560]  special counsel team operated under was guided by and followed justice department
[01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:22.960]  policies and principles so which DOJ policy or principle sets forth a legal
[01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:27.000]  standard that an investigated person is not exonerated if their innocence from
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:32.880]  criminal conduct is not conclusively determined can you repeat the last part
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:37.760]  of that question yeah which DOJ policy or principle set forth a legal standard
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:41.640]  that an investigated person is not exonerated if their innocence from
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:46.840]  criminal criminal conduct is not conclusively determined where does that
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:53.720]  language come from director where is the DOJ policy that says that can you let me
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:59.040]  make it easier is there you go ahead it can you give me an example other than
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:02.160]  Donald Trump where the Justice Department determined that an investigated
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:06.400]  person was not exonerated because their innocence was not conclusively determined
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:12.040]  I cannot but this is a unique okay well you can't time is short I've got five
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:15.560]  minutes let's just leave it at you can't find it because I'll tell you why it
[01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:20.240]  doesn't exist the special counsel's job nowhere does it say that you were to
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:23.640]  conclusively determine Donald Trump's innocence or that the special counsel
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:27.320]  report should determine whether or not to exonerate him it's not in any of the
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:30.400]  documents it's not in your appointment order it's not in the special counsel
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:34.240]  regulations it's not in the OLC opinions it's not in the Justice Manual and it's
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:37.040]  not in the principles of federal prosecution nowhere do those words
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:41.840]  appear together because respectfully respectfully director it was not the
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:45.520]  special counsel's job to conclusively determine Donald Trump's innocence or
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:50.480]  to exonerate him because the bedrock principle of our justice system is a
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:55.360]  presumption of innocence it exists for everyone everyone is entitled to it
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:03:00.480]  including sitting presidents and because there is a presumption of innocence
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:06.120]  prosecutors never ever need to conclusively determine it now director
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:12.160]  the special counsel applied this inverted burden of proof that I can't find
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:17.160]  and you said doesn't exist anywhere in the department policies and you used it
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:22.960]  to write a report and the very first line of your report the very first line of
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:27.220]  your report says and you as you read this morning it authorizes the special
[01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:31.840]  counsel to provide the attorney general with a confidential report explaining
[01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:35.960]  the prosecution or declination decisions reached by the special counsel
[01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:40.360]  that's the very first word of your report right that's correct here's the
[01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:47.080]  problem director the special counsel didn't do that on volume one you did on
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:51.440]  volume volume two with respect to potential of obstruction of justice the
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:56.680]  special counsel made neither a prosecution decision or a declination
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:00.640]  decision you made no decision you told us this morning and in your report that
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:04.640]  you made no determination so respectfully director you didn't follow the
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:10.320]  special counsel regulations it clearly says write a confidential report about
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:15.760]  decisions reached nowhere in here does it say write a report about decisions
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:21.960]  that weren't reached you wrote 180 pages 180 pages about decisions that weren't
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:27.000]  reached about potential crimes that weren't charged or decided and
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:32.280]  respectfully respectfully by doing that you managed to violate every principle
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:37.720]  and the most sacred of traditions about prosecutors not offering extra
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:42.400]  prosecutorial analysis about potential crimes that aren't charged so
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:46.480]  Americans need to know this as they listen to the Democrats and socialists
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:51.120]  on the other side of the aisle as they do dramatic readings from alright folks
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:55.960]  this we're gonna go to break and come back with the real clown world and so
[01:04:55.960 --> 01:05:03.040]  much more before I started working at info wars I was not only a fan of Alex
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:06.960]  Jones and in force dot com but also the products at info or store dot com and
[01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:11.000]  there's one product that's offered at info or store dot com that is the elite
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:15.440]  of the supplements and that's DNA force plus now I remember when Alex first
[01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:19.200]  started talking about this with some of his special guests telomeres and
[01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:23.680]  telomere support with your DNA so I started to look into the science and
[01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:29.120]  what telomeres were and how it can improve your health and longevity when
[01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:33.160]  you protect your telomeres so I started looking into DNA force plus but it's
[01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:37.800]  expensive why because it is an elite supplement and then I started seeing
[01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:41.600]  other competitors coming up with competitive supplements for telomere
[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:47.760]  support and they came and they went but DNA force plus is still there it is the
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:51.880]  elite supplement I get excited when DNA force plus is on sale because I know
[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:57.040]  it's expensive so you should take advantage of 50% off DNA force plus at
[01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:13.480]  info or store dot com waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to
[01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:25.120]  you live from the front lines of the info war a lot of foreign powers a lot
[01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:31.120]  of special interests have used our open society that's why George Soros calls
[01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:36.440]  his criminal enterprise the open society foundation to come in and wage war
[01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:41.560]  against the nation to teach us to hate ourselves to lie about our institutions
[01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:45.520]  to undermine them and collapse them not to make them better I've criticized
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:49.360]  institutions I've criticized bad cops I've criticized bad politicians I've
[01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:52.080]  gone after people trying to get rid of the second amendment or the right to
[01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:57.080]  the first amendment but that's not our government it's the globalists that hate
[01:06:57.080 --> 01:07:02.560]  our form of government they're the anti government individuals because they
[01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:06.400]  want to overthrow our form has been proven to be the best form and replace
[01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:12.160]  it with the lying mob rule we see today without even looking I've got stacks of
[01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:18.400]  articles here we're in California and Illinois and Maryland and everywhere
[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:26.920]  the Democrats are controlled people are losing their student loan financial
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:31.640]  aid because the unions and the lawyers are stealing all of it just like
[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:38.360]  Detroit fell most prosperous area of our country now the poorest eight 80,000
[01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:48.080]  California students lose financial aid thanks to teachers union I don't need
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:50.400]  that clip anymore guys I don't need the clip anymore can we just have a
[01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:54.560]  document game shot packs so again 80,000 California students lose financial
[01:07:54.560 --> 01:08:05.160]  aid thanks to teachers union state government think about that and that's
[01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:12.080]  just one in my stack today what you get under their control is collapse of
[01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:20.800]  civilization and then you get Cummings Elijah Cummings always up there saying
[01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:24.880]  everybody's in the KKK always saying white people to the devil just like
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:30.280]  AFC just spewing the most racist crap that almost no one's buying and saying
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:32.920]  people are drinking out of toilets they're killing kids it's their limiting
[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:38.480]  cages so that Obama had people doing none of it's true but the whole corporate
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:45.760]  media will still line up behind it and the new thing is Trump was calling
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:52.260]  everyone in Baltimore rats the black people because they're all out
[01:08:52.260 --> 01:08:55.400]  complaining saying there's all these videos saying we see everybody getting
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:59.240]  all this free stuff and all this help from other countries how about here where
[01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:02.920]  these people dump junk in the street and they just let people shoot whoever they
[01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:07.880]  want Elijah Cummings doesn't give a damn what does Cummings do when his black
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:13.960]  constituents are saying that he just goes it's better to have rats than to be a
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:21.080]  rat like Donald Trump but that doesn't stop CNN anchor Victor Blackwell chokes
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:27.240]  up on air after Trump rips infested Baltimore and then you read before I
[01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:30.840]  get to this clip let me show you some of these headlines Trump tells black
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:35.560]  lawmaker to clean up disgusting rat and rodent infested district you know like
[01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:39.840]  Skid Row and LA or what's happening in San Francisco where most of the people
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:43.480]  in San Francisco aren't black that are homeless or in Portland they're not black
[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:47.400]  it's a bunch of white people on heroin and running around robbing and killing
[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:51.760]  the point is this is going on in every Democrat area this wasn't about black
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:55.600]  people other than trying to clean this area up and get jobs and businesses back
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:10:00.520]  in that Trump's been trying to do and that's a fact but Elijah Cummings doesn't
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:03.560]  want his people to get up off their knees in front of him he wants them to
[01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:06.240]  stay on their knees
[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:12.120]  outrage as Trump brands mostly black Baltimore as infested mess notice how
[01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:17.480]  they did the quote in yahoo he said a rat infested mess that you need to clean
[01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:25.240]  up for your people was the quote that turns into infested mess Elijah Cummings
[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:29.240]  thinks the corporate media still has total power he still thinks he can put
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:34.720]  out a big fat lie and people are gonna believe it
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:40.040]  there's another one AP Trump attacks minority black district represented by
[01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:47.600]  credit oh when Trump tried to get industry and jobs and to make sure that
[01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:51.200]  the welfare actually goes the people in stolen by the mob lost Cummings Cummings
[01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:55.160]  under criminal investigation and you should know that trying to help people
[01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:59.480]  out turns into attacking black people hey how about you take care of your people
[01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:04.040]  and clean it up and get some jobs in there and all the rats and mattresses and
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:08.560]  garbage and that turns into by the alchemy of the AP Trump attacks majority
[01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:14.280]  black district represented by critic Trump slams Cummings brutal bully whose
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:17.800]  Baltimore district far worse than southern border that's what Trump was
[01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:23.320]  saying Trump was saying you're saying that we're running Nazi death camps
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:25.960]  you're saying we're killing people you're saying we make a drink out of
[01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:29.200]  oil son that's true why don't you clean up your place that actually is a hell
[01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:32.840]  hole you say the border patrols responsible for all these crimes that
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:36.200]  aren't true when if you're their representative and it's way worse than
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:41.440]  the border what do you say about yourself you hypocrite Cummings did you hear
[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:46.840]  he called black people rats and CNN goes yeah Trump called blacks rats are you
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:49.960]  insulted whether you're white or black or whatever the hell color you are that

[01:11:55.680 --> 01:12:01.160]  but it gets worse CNN anchor Victor Blackwell chokes up on air after Trump

[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:29.680]  media lines up to lie about it but like Donnie Deutz on MSNBC it's time to start
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:34.240]  fighting dirty truth is you guys are hated because you fight dirty everybody's
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:39.960]  finally aware of it here's the crime CNN reporter there's a revolution going on
[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:44.640]  in California so many sanctuary areas want out of this ridiculous crime
[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:50.600]  infested and breeding concept infested he says the president says about

[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:29.840]  no human should put up with this it looks like no humans who put up with what
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:33.320]  you're doing to your own people and what you allow the city doesn't even spend
[01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:36.480]  the money they steal to clean up garbage in the street and the police won't do
[01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:39.560]  their job because they're leftist and they're so afraid they'll get fired so
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:45.240]  they let gangbangers kill people and attack the police and then you cry about
[01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:50.720]  how Trump's trying to hurt you because you pray on those people anchor Victor

[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:28.520]  Nancy Pelosi or any of these guys Maxine waters and they come suck off their
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:32.360]  constituents the poorest the most down-to-road and don't do jack crap while

[01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:41.080]  area of Italy right now a $300,000 private government jet that's how much
[01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:45.640]  the trips cost and lecturing Trump about how he's not taking care of all these
[01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:49.680]  people with more free stuff now I'm taking Trump to the woodshed in a loving
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:56.520]  way we come back I'm Alex Jones with info wars dot com info wars dot com
[01:15:56.520 --> 01:16:03.320]  Alex yes I got a plug for the Patriot points I get $180 so far this year and
[01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:07.080]  I feel like I'm stealing from you I buy so much in the store because I mean I
[01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:09.400]  don't want to get that money to Walmart I don't want to give that money to people
[01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:12.960]  gonna donate it to causes I don't believe in so I rather give that money to you
[01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:16.040]  and I'm getting quality products the products that I do receive have changed
[01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:20.120]  my life I mean the X2 has really done a lot for me I've lost weight my brain
[01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:23.920]  works a whole lot better I made my kid they use the toothpaste my son used to
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:27.720]  get these little sore throat and he puts X2 in water and drinks it and it gets
[01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:32.560]  rid of his sore throat I want high quality stuff in there I want a good
[01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:36.360]  price but I've kind of habituated everybody to where everybody buys when
[01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:40.200]  it's 50% off I'm making $2 on the toothpaste 50% off and so it's the same
[01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:43.720]  thing like the fish oil or the turmeric or the bone broth thank you so much for
[01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:47.480]  the plugs but listen when people get the Patriot points a lot of times it makes
[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:50.880]  things a loss leader because if you're already getting 10% off as you're on
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:54.800]  autoship then we're doing 50% off and then you do something like that we have
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:58.680]  Patriot points we lose money but that's okay thanks for the support last night
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:04.200]  I'm on info wars.com and I read Chris Pratt criticized for t-shirt choice it
[01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:09.080]  is literally the shirt that I envisioned a Betsy Ross but also another just
[01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:14.200]  classic American flag all 50 stars with the Gadsden snake superimposed over and
[01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:18.120]  on the back America's back info wars.com but what's better than just an
[01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:21.320]  American flag about a don't tread on me under the flag take don't trail the
[01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:24.080]  American flag it's a perfect combo so great minds think alike I mean whoever
[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:27.560]  designed that shirt we'd already come up with the exact same similar design it
[01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:32.280]  is the don't tread on me American flag t-shirt inspired by the triggering of
[01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:36.720]  leftist of the shirt worn by Chris Pratt but it's a you know battle-cattered flag
[01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:39.760]  like the one that flew over Fort Sumter and again on the back it says
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:46.680]  America's back info wars.com 4,000 of these babies and that's it so we've got

[01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:13.800]  what a globalist are obsessed with it trying to shut it down I didn't invent
[01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:17.760]  all this I went and researched the Renaissance Americana and what really
[01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:21.800]  works for humanity and I'm simply trying to bring it back and lo and behold
[01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:26.360]  it's super popular like it's always been that's why the globalists are trying to
[01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:30.960]  shut it down so desperately because we have the light in the dark of the night

[01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:42.200]  going to happen on this timeline it's like I've been drinking three bottles of
[01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:46.520]  Jack Daniels a day your liver's gonna fail smoking ten packs of cigarettes a
[01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:50.040]  day you're gonna you're gonna get emphysema lung cancer the big tech
[01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:53.680]  giants have all been caught on eternal videos project Veritas they've all their
[01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:57.240]  own statements have come out there's been lawsuits they say oh my gosh we
[01:20:57.240 --> 01:21:00.840]  already tilted it towards Hillary we're already rigged search results but we
[01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:03.040]  didn't do a bunch of other stuff we thought we get caught but this time
[01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:07.840]  we're banning anybody promoting Trump anybody telling people to vote and all
[01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:11.080]  the algorithms all the studies is coming up next time we replace some of the
[01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:15.760]  professors clearly show that they can steal the election trump won in a
[01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:26.080]  landslide in 2016 but he barely won because of the giant fraud now let's
[01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:32.080]  get into it it's been exponential they demonized me for a good year and a half
[01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:38.720]  like I was the second coming of Satan on every channel in the country to
[01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:42.000]  demonize the internet and the idea of conservatism and nationalism and
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:45.480]  populism and to demonize trump and I try to get trump to come out and attack
[01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:49.120]  me it didn't work and even if he did I wasn't gonna come out and attack him we
[01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:52.760]  had that discussion I just as long as his balls these are good as long as he's
[01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:55.400]  trying I don't care if he says I'm the devil if he needs to of course he's
[01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:59.480]  never done that it'll turn his constituents off we're the core of
[01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:04.880]  Trump supporters but I clearly knew and a month before I got banned a year ago
[01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:11.040]  it's 11 months ago it's August 7th all the big tech got together and decided to
[01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:15.160]  do it they admitted it they said kick him off every platform then that didn't
[01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:19.640]  work so ban his name ban any positive mention of him ban info wars calm don't
[01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:24.920]  allow anybody to put it out and people went along with that because they didn't
[01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:29.480]  want to get banned next and then oh the folks bought that let's start banning
[01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:33.280]  hundreds of other people that are prominent then it was up to 800
[01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:37.200]  conservative activists and people a day and then it was a thousand a day and now
[01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:43.800]  it was a hundred something thousand Friday it started Friday it's 200,000 as
[01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:49.080]  of this afternoon when I counted it up document cam shot place this is Donald
[01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:57.080]  Trump's Twitter 62.4 million here's his Instagram 13.9 million followers it's
[01:22:57.080 --> 01:23:06.000]  already shadow banned now the left can't mean they don't people talking via
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:11.800]  memes automatic censorship algorithms can't tell what's funny what's not they
[01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:17.440]  can't censor things as good as an algorithm does so they need people to do
[01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:22.640]  it again memes are hard to censor you got to have a person looking at it so
[01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:28.480]  there's an article from RT this is the end game Instagram users event after
[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:33.880]  site calls meme posting videos I know who all these top groups are hundreds of
[01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:41.440]  accounts banned one of the accounts had over 40 million followers people that
[01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:50.440]  signed up to have the information sent to them 40 plus million think about that
[01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:57.320]  here's another one again right here this is spicy MP4 this is the end game 40
[01:23:57.320 --> 01:24:03.400]  plus million followers and over $600,000 a year in all the accounts this
[01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:08.440]  person had all the work they put in blown away forget the money it's the
[01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:14.120]  speech that matters gone here's another one Instagram you just deleted all my
[01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:24.320]  accounts 30 plus million followers that just happened so I'm going over all
[01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:31.960]  this and there's hundreds of these that add up there's hundreds of these that
[01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:44.200]  add up to over 200 million followers banned in just the last three days so
[01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:47.680]  it's pure exponential in fact forget exponential exponential means just
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:51.120]  going straight up it's doubling this is like five times exponential a hundred
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:59.320]  times it's just it's it's just they're banning everyone I have family that gave
[01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:03.480]  a donation to Trump and you know has a Facebook and mainly since around family
[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:08.280]  photos they're being banned everyone I know is being banned this is a giant
[01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:11.840]  scandal against the communication systems of conservatives nationals
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:15.600]  Christians you've heard the Democrats we're going to war we're gonna fight
[01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:22.720]  dirty and then institutions like Facebook and Google who each are bigger than
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:26.320]  Maubel ever imagined they're not getting broken up they're not getting fought
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:32.200]  back against and so they're going to the limit to suppress speech and suppress
[01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:35.880]  all the crazy things Democrats are doing so they can call for violence so they
[01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:40.640]  can physically attack people and so it can all be covered up and so Elijah
[01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:44.500]  Cummings can run around and say that we're killing Hispanic children in
[01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:50.800]  death camps and no one can respond to it so the stories up on info wars calm the
[01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:55.080]  full message that I taped today before I went live is I wanted to be really
[01:25:55.080 --> 01:26:00.280]  focused is on info wars calm we'll show people that posting right now it's on

[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:44.440]  will we not put up with I don't have time to get to this because I've got this
[01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:51.120]  next segment coming up it's so important in the final segment but YouTube is
[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:54.600]  officially telling people you can't put Christian in your tag and you can't have
[01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:58.760]  Christian ads that is offensive they're officially saying it remember a few
[01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:02.720]  years ago Google Doodle on Christmas and Easter would say nothing about Jesus or
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:06.200]  even Christianity or even a Christmas tree that isn't even Christian or a bunny

[01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:05.160]  I've decided that we're gonna kind of reboot all our supplements in that if
[01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:08.440]  you go back five six years ago before all the censorship of the tax and fake
[01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:11.520]  lawsuits the rest of it I would talk about how great the products are and
[01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:14.520]  how they were the best and why they were and I'd have doctors on an experts to
[01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:17.840]  explain why they were so good and instead the last few years I'm like hey we need
[01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:20.720]  to really support us or they'll shut us down the biggest thing people like to
[01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:23.000]  buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful they
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:27.040]  were and the left always has headlines everywhere. Joan sells unapproved
[01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:30.960]  supplements that he claims are supplements no under federal law since
[01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:35.960]  1996 you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have
[01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:39.040]  no jurisdiction it won't look at it but then they say you've got to say it's not
[01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:42.640]  approved by them and all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in
[01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:45.640]  Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things and a lot of drugs
[01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:49.280]  work great they have side effects not with Mother Nature but Big Pharma doesn't
[01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:53.600]  want you knowing about God's medicine chest infowarstore.com or
[01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:59.560]  triple eight two five three three one three nine talk to Marcus in New York
[01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:09.120]  Marcus here on the air thanks for holding. Hey Alex yeah I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air. I talked to a lot of people here out in New York City and one thing I could tell you is that almost nobody
[01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:13.000]  agrees with these wars I think that the Neocons are trying desperately to get
[01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:16.800]  Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could
[01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:20.720]  defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching 2020. That's it I mean if
[01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:24.040]  Trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's the only way I think
[01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:26.520]  he can be defeated other than assassinating him. It's a time to be
[01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:29.800]  praying my friend. I agree entirely and the last thing I just want to say Alex is
[01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:33.560]  I know they're trying to shut you down but the reinforcements have arrived man I
[01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:37.200]  would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old I'd love to see what
[01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:40.840]  you're talking about when you're 80 but if they do shut you down no you've gone
[01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:45.240]  into this war you've won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people like
[01:32:45.240 --> 01:32:48.720]  myself and many others who are gonna continue we're gonna keep fighting in
[01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:52.520]  the input war and even if something does happen to you or your show know for a
[01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:56.680]  fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty. Thank you sir for
[01:32:56.680 --> 01:32:58.960]  calling.
[01:32:58.960 --> 01:33:23.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:29.640]  President Trump I am here to respectfully tell you that if you don't wake the f**k up and
[01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:33.800]  take action right now you're not gonna get re-elected in 2020. In fact the
[01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:38.800]  globalists are gonna steal that election and then fully overthrow this nation as
[01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:43.200]  you know well. I'm about to give you a briefing on the in-game of censorship and
[01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:47.040]  the fact that you must act now.
[01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:57.440]  Mr. President we're able to get this report to you. I beg you for yourself your
[01:33:57.440 --> 01:34:01.800]  family my family in the whole world to understand that your blind spot your
[01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:06.360]  Achilles heel is your confidence that you can overpower the censors and
[01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:12.200]  overpower the manipulation that we saw in 2016. That was intense but nothing
[01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:15.560]  compared to what the Democrats the deep state are doing this time they have
[01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:21.520]  pulled out all the stops. In just the last three days Mr. President we have
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:29.360]  seen over 200 million followers to scores of popular Instagram and Facebook
[01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:36.360]  accounts deleted and the accounts removed. Some of these accounts had 43
[01:34:36.360 --> 01:34:41.760]  million followers apiece others had over 30 million. If you combine just the top
[01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:45.640]  two accounts that got deleted for no reason other than they were politically
[01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:49.920]  popular and shared your information that's more followers than you have on
[01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:56.080]  Twitter. The Democrats admit the EU admits the big tech giants admit that
[01:34:56.080 --> 01:35:01.560]  memes are more powerful than all cable news combined now. It's how America
[01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:06.520]  communicates and the fact that you've let them do this to thousands of other
[01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:10.480]  prominent conservatives and nationalists and haven't taken action yet other than
[01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:16.120]  criticizing it has green lit the purges to now be exponential. This is your
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:20.920]  distribution network that was getting your speeches and your statements and
[01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:24.720]  your administration's truth out to counter the establishment lies and
[01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:30.040]  they're just being annihilated on a daily basis over 200 million in just the
[01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:36.400]  last three days. Look at this it's spicy MP4 had over 40 million followers
[01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:41.720]  people that signed up over the years to follow the memes and post most of it
[01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:46.320]  your information all gone unable to communicate popular meme aggregator
[01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:51.560]  your dank with over 30 million followers gone in just the last few days
[01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:56.960]  dozens of his accounts and it goes on and on and on every few hours new giant
[01:35:56.960 --> 01:36:01.600]  list come out we go click on them they're dead they're gone gone gone gone
[01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:05.280]  gone because nothing is being done by your administration. We've heard a bunch
[01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:09.000]  of talk about anti-trust heard a bunch of talk about injunctions this is
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:13.640]  election meddling. Imagine if hundreds and hundreds of millions of people
[01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:18.840]  following Democrat sites and Democrat news organizations were suddenly being
[01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:23.640]  deleted in a coordinated fashion there would be an outcry the likes of which
[01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:27.760]  the world's never seen. Federal courts have ruled that people can attack you
[01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:32.920]  and lie about you on Twitter and have it posted to the very top but they can
[01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:37.280]  then delete everybody completely and remove them forever. Your namesake your
[01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:42.280]  son Don Jr. has been one of the most prominent people accurately exposing
[01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:46.080]  what's happening in the peril to this country and your second term. You've got
[01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:49.520]  Tucker Carlson you've got Matt Drudge doing a great job exposing it but I know
[01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:53.960]  what's going on. The big fat cat politicos at Fox and other areas they want
[01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:58.280]  the hundreds of millions of donation money to only go to their packs only go
[01:36:58.280 --> 01:37:02.080]  to their advertisements. Nobody's even advertising with meme makers in places
[01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:05.440]  like in fours. We didn't get any money in the last election. We just wanted to
[01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:09.880]  see the country made great again just like you do but because the old dying
[01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:15.520]  political neocon media system is jealous and envious of new media they're
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:19.840]  working with the Democrats openly to suppress and shut down their competition
[01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:25.160]  at America and your expense. Trump I'm sitting here watching these Lillipullies
[01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:30.440]  eat you alive and carve you up like a giant ham and damn it I care about you
[01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:34.880]  and my fate's tied to you and I'm pissed buddy if you keep sitting there and
[01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:38.560]  taking this crap I'm not gonna put up with it anymore because it doesn't matter
[01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:42.520]  how good your agenda is and how many other great things you do if you sit
[01:37:42.520 --> 01:37:45.760]  there and let these out of control criminals walk in here and steal our
[01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:50.520]  first amendment and steal this damn election that I don't know what I'm
[01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:55.480]  gonna be forced to do but let me tell you watching you let these bastards pull
[01:37:55.480 --> 01:37:59.960]  this off makes me sick and so I'm begging my listeners and my viewers to lie to
[01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:04.600]  fire under everybody in your administration's ass to stand up for the
[01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:08.280]  first amendment and to move out of the way of your second term after this whole
[01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:11.760]  Russia gate got proven as a fraud so we could try to restore this Republic
[01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:16.400]  against the globalist or try to shut it down. President Trump you've got 13.9
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:21.640]  million followers on Instagram just two accounts on Instagram had over 70
[01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:26.400]  million that promoted everything you're doing you understand that that's just
[01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:30.440]  two of the hundreds of millions gone the last few days Hillary understood the
[01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:34.160]  power of the internet she tried to dominate social media but nobody wanted
[01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:39.240]  to follow her even though Facebook and Google and Twitter force fed her they
[01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:42.840]  underestimated you they underestimated the people but now they haven't
[01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:46.760]  underestimated it they're pulling out all the stops for people to vote in the
[01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:50.880]  names of dead folks and for electronic voting machine fraud and for flooding the
[01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:56.520]  borders and for all of this but the big enchilada is the internet and I just sit
[01:38:56.520 --> 01:38:59.880]  here with horror watching you be lied about and myself being lied about and
[01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:03.120]  watching the hell we go through try to restore this Republic and you said we
[01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:06.840]  should never let another president or another country or this nation go
[01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:10.440]  through this again and I agree with you but we're going through something even
[01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:16.160]  worse right now and Russia gates been a distraction from censorship gate an
[01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:20.680]  election meddling gate in closing I have some final words for the president
[01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:24.720]  some final words for viewers and listeners and other media people as I
[01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:28.600]  said other than Matt Drudge and Tucker Carlson and Don Jr. and a few others
[01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:33.040]  everybody else thought it was cute when I got banned and they'd say oh how is it
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:37.360]  how you doing we're so sad for you and I'd say oh you're sad for me they're
[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:41.800]  coming for you next and after they take all your speech they're gonna take all
[01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:47.080]  the rest of your freedom that's how it works and a year later here we are so
[01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:49.760]  it's very painful to watch folks at the big Trump event at the White House go
[01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:54.440]  oh Alex was patient zero we wish he was here I don't give a rat's ass about
[01:39:54.440 --> 01:39:58.280]  being in the middle of the swamp at the White House I care about freedom and
[01:39:58.280 --> 01:40:02.480]  defeating tyrants and I warned you all how they were coming for everybody's
[01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:08.560]  freedoms and now we're here so we need to take action now and realize they first
[01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:12.680]  demonize somebody ban them make it all about them and then everybody else
[01:40:12.680 --> 01:40:17.160]  follows and that's what's been done Trump's the target the American people
[01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:20.520]  the target we're all the target and we've got to stand together because we
[01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:25.440]  don't have free speech and a First Amendment what do we have big tech is
[01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:30.320]  the modern telecommunication system like the telephone and we all have a right
[01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:35.680]  to it I'm gonna end this special report with a little clip of Dr. Epstein full
[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:40.040]  congressional testimony is on info wars.com Congress is starting to figure
[01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:44.320]  out what's happening but we don't have that long for this learning curve we've
[01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:48.640]  got to have a crash course in awakening now and that's why info wars.com
[01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:52.680]  stand strong as the tip of the spear and that's why the globalists want to shut
[01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:55.720]  down because we are the modern Paul Revere's thank you all for your support
[01:40:55.720 --> 01:41:01.360]  here's a short clip of Dr. Epstein. Google's manipulation of votes gave at
[01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:07.960]  least 2.6 million additional votes to Hillary Clinton in the year 2016 is that
[01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:15.960]  correct 2.6 million is a rock bottom minimum the range is between 2.6 and
[01:41:15.960 --> 01:41:22.160]  10.4 million votes depending on how aggressive they were in using the
[01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:28.440]  techniques that I've been studying they control these and no one can counteract
[01:41:28.440 --> 01:41:33.440]  them these are not competitive these are tools that they have at their
[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:41.520]  disposal exclusively. Your testimony is that Google is through bias in search
[01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:48.560]  results manipulating voters in a way they're not aware of. On a massive scale
[01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:54.360]  in 2020 if all these companies are supporting the same candidate there are
[01:41:54.360 --> 01:42:00.080]  15 million votes on the line that can be shifted without people's knowledge and
[01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:05.200]  without leaving a paper trail for authorities to trace. Without monitoring
[01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:10.880]  systems in place we'll never know what these companies are doing and in 2020
[01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:18.600]  you can bet that all of these companies are going to go all out and the methods
[01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:25.280]  that they're using are invisible they're subliminal they're more powerful than
[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:29.440]  most any effects I've ever seen in the behavioral sciences and I've been in the
[01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:33.720]  behavioral sciences for almost 40 years. A handful of Silicon Valley billionaires
[01:42:33.720 --> 01:42:39.320]  and giant corporations are able to spend millions of dollars if not billions of
[01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:45.880]  dollars collectively massively influencing the results of elections.
[01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:50.880]  Senator with respect I must correct you please if Mark Zuckerberg chooses to
[01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:55.240]  send out a go vote reminder just to Democrats on election day that doesn't
[01:42:55.240 --> 01:43:01.360]  cost him a dime. Robert Barnes what has Big Tech become? Big Tech are big babies
[01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:04.240]  that have become big bullies and the way they did so is because they face no
[01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:08.240]  consequence social economic political or legal for their illicit activities over
[01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:11.880]  two decades and because of that that's why the courts the judges the juries the
[01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:14.760]  members of the independent free press that care about this the ordinary
[01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:17.720]  members of the public in the audience that care about this have to bring real
[01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:21.400]  social political economic consequence to their course of conduct otherwise they
[01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:24.880]  will never change and they will become the Big Tech oligarchs the equivalent to
[01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:28.280]  the big trust of the 19th century who ran American politics and ran American
[01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:31.600]  economy almost into the ground until we were able to recover after the Great
[01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:35.560]  Depression. The inforores audience is the fuel that flames the the light of
[01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:39.840]  liberty across the world to make real the actions of independent free speech to
[01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:43.600]  make real the original promise of an independent free press real collusion is
[01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:47.000]  Big Tech and big media manipulating and working with each other to try to
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:50.520]  meddle with elections to try to shake people's thoughts and then the whopper of
[01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:53.480]  telling us the whole time it's not happening it's the ultimate form of gas
[01:43:53.480 --> 01:43:57.160]  lighting what you just saw isn't what you just saw even it is what what you just
[01:43:57.160 --> 01:44:04.840]  saw. Infowars the most banned network in the world. Ewers and listeners I wouldn't
[01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:09.080]  be here if it wasn't for you and we're under unprecedented evil attacks as
[01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:12.680]  you've seen but I wanted to take just a minute out here from the bottom of my
[01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:15.960]  heart to tell you how much it means to me that when you saw all those lies
[01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:19.600]  against us last week the worst things you can say about people that you knew
[01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:22.600]  they were liars you went and looked it up and found out the truth and so I feel
[01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:27.120]  very strong and I feel God's hand on my shoulder and I feel your love in my heart
[01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:30.280]  I want you know that love is right back at you and I want to thank you for all
[01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:33.520]  you've done with your word of mouth and your prayers your financial support
[01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:38.160]  because I'm committed to fight to the end but I want to win and without you I'm
[01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:42.000]  gonna be destroyed and it's not gonna be fun but that's not what's important the
[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:46.280]  enemy could win we're a key chess piece in this fight we're being used by God
[01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:50.000]  you're being used by God this is Providence so I salute you and I thank
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.800]  you for all you've done from the bottom of my heart
[01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:57.680]  Info Wars, the most banned network in the world
[01:44:57.680 --> 01:45:02.840]  there are thousands of ideologies out there hundreds of different political
[01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:08.280]  systems and most of them are funded by the globalist Info Wars is truly the
[01:45:08.280 --> 01:45:11.480]  tip of the spear of the zeitgeist that's what a globalist are obsessed with it
[01:45:11.480 --> 01:45:15.520]  trying to shut it down I didn't invent all this I went and researched the
[01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:20.040]  Renaissance Americana and what really works for humanity and I'm simply trying
[01:45:20.040 --> 01:45:24.240]  to bring it back and lo and behold it's super popular like it's always been
[01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:28.960]  that's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately because we
[01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:33.160]  have the light in the dark of the night that sends chills up my spine so

[01:47:17.720 --> 01:47:23.120]  Trump is just a desperate last gasp if we don't keep him in office and remove
[01:47:23.120 --> 01:47:26.160]  the globalist that have dug into our government and who created the whole
[01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:30.360]  russia gate hoax and who've committed all these other crimes when do they get
[01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:34.880]  in trouble for what they've done that's the question I'm asking but so often in
[01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:39.160]  the fight to keep this operation going I forget to remind viewers and remind
[01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:42.640]  listeners that without you and word of mouth telling people about the show and
[01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:45.960]  how to find it without you sharing the audio in the videos we post in four
[01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:50.160]  calm the globalists are going to be able to carry out their plan to overthrow
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:52.920]  this country once and for all so that's why it's important for you to please
[01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:56.400]  watch this short presentation at the end of the show today that breaks down
[01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:59.280]  things we can personally do for our bodies and support the broadcast at the
[01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:03.120]  same time and I'll see you Lord willing back tomorrow 11 a.m. central with the
[01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:06.480]  Monday additional y'all show show
[01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:28.000]  info wars the most banned network in the world the listeners of this
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:33.440]  syndicated radio and TV broadcast are the lifeblood of our operation and I had
[01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:38.320]  a big realization a few months ago that I'm constantly talking about how
[01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:44.080]  critical it is that you buy our products for us to survive instead of talking
[01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:48.320]  about why the products are so game-changing and so amazing first
[01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:55.800]  thing I want to hit is the iodine conspiracy the world is filled with bad
[01:48:55.800 --> 01:49:01.840]  halogens fluoride chlorine bromide bromine and many others all of them are
[01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:06.800]  toxic to the body but when the body doesn't have good clean iodine it will
[01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:13.520]  use the bad halogens in its place in all the glands and in the bone marrow and in
[01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:19.040]  the brain here are several mainstream news articles that link to major studies
[01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:26.920]  out of PubMed and Harvard and others how adding iodine to salt boosted America's
[01:49:26.920 --> 01:49:33.200]  IQs here's some of the other headlines how adding iodine to salt resulted in a
[01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:39.800]  decades worth of IQ gains for the United States again they only mandated it for a
[01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:46.320]  few decades but companies continued to do it right through the 1970s so let's go
[01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:50.360]  over some of these points here that are backed up in historical fact to
[01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:56.440]  understand why pure iodine is so important the secret history of iodine
[01:49:56.440 --> 01:50:03.600]  how iodine increased IQs by 15 points and it goes through the shocking
[01:50:03.600 --> 01:50:07.160]  developments the true history of iodine is something that most mainstream
[01:50:07.160 --> 01:50:13.600]  experts won't talk about in the early 1920s it was found that just adding iodine
[01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:20.440]  to salt supply produced a staggering 15 point IQ increase in iodine deficient
[01:50:20.440 --> 01:50:25.120]  populations that that is that is so bombshell so yes ladies and gentlemen
[01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:29.880]  it's a win-win we fund our operation not selling you opiates that kill
[01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:35.920]  millions a year not selling you all these toxic drugs not pushing Tylenol
[01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:40.600]  that eats your liver on you no we promote things that God gave us through
[01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:47.760]  mother nature x2 is the only true nascent iodine known on the market it's
[01:50:47.760 --> 01:50:54.760]  procured between 7 and 12,000 feet deep in the earth it is completely clean now
[01:50:54.760 --> 01:51:00.120]  a very small percentage of the population cannot absorb pure atomic iodine
[01:51:00.120 --> 01:51:05.120]  that's why we have survival shield x3 that has the deep earth crystal iodine
[01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:10.760]  and two other types potassium iodine very clean form and sodium iodine I
[01:51:10.760 --> 01:51:18.240]  personally eight years ago was about 80 pounds overweight and I was swimming up
[01:51:18.240 --> 01:51:24.160]  to a mile a day I was jogging my body just couldn't lose it I went on the
[01:51:24.160 --> 01:51:28.000]  precursor of x2 working with research scientists that were telling me how
[01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:32.320]  important iodine was they wanted me to see for myself and the weight began to
[01:51:32.320 --> 01:51:38.360]  pour off I had sunspots on my skin I love the sun they all went away all this
[01:51:38.360 --> 01:51:41.760]  oil came out of my scalp my body I don't want to tell you what happened in the
[01:51:41.760 --> 01:51:47.920]  bathroom and I was warned about three weeks into this most people have a
[01:51:47.920 --> 01:51:53.080]  detoxifying event and it happened so do your own research and then understand
[01:51:53.080 --> 01:51:55.920]  we are bringing you just like our informations hardcore and game changing
[01:51:55.920 --> 01:52:02.080]  the most powerful iodine's out there the purest the cleanest but do your own
[01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:07.000]  research into the iodine conspiracy now that said you're probably noticing that
[01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:14.480]  behind me while I've been talking we've not been showing x2 or x3 and that's
[01:52:14.480 --> 01:52:19.080]  because this is the other big missing link and something I don't promote enough
[01:52:19.080 --> 01:52:24.760]  now I was never a big supplement person so about seven eight years ago and when
[01:52:24.760 --> 01:52:28.480]  I saw how good clean iodine helped me I began to research well what are the
[01:52:28.480 --> 01:52:31.880]  biggest game changers out there and then I learned from top developers around
[01:52:31.880 --> 01:52:37.000]  the country well nobody will really put pharmaceutical grade things in their
[01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:42.160]  products other than the Japanese because marketers want to put all their money
[01:52:42.160 --> 01:52:48.080]  into models they want to put all their money into the high production value and
[01:52:48.080 --> 01:52:51.960]  million-dollar ads they don't want to put it into the product and I later
[01:52:51.960 --> 01:52:57.600]  discovered that most companies the bottle cost more than what's in them
[01:52:57.600 --> 01:53:04.360]  that's not the case with other critical game changers like DNA Force plus this
[01:53:04.360 --> 01:53:11.480]  product has 30 plus dollars of product in it and that's only because I cited
[01:53:11.480 --> 01:53:15.000]  two-year contract for millions and millions of dollars to get the price
[01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:20.120]  cut in almost half so that's how we're able to call it DNA plus and lower the
[01:53:20.120 --> 01:53:23.960]  price it's retail used to be a hundred and fifty dollars we'd sell it for about
[01:53:23.960 --> 01:53:30.440]  a hundred on sale now I can sell it on sale for way less than that ladies and
[01:53:30.440 --> 01:53:35.160]  gentlemen and again it takes two to three weeks to kick in you've got to do
[01:53:35.160 --> 01:53:39.440]  your own research into everything that is in this because there are synthetic
[01:53:39.440 --> 01:53:48.200]  forms of PQQ and CoQ10 and Reservatol and ELEV ATP and all the other things
[01:53:48.200 --> 01:53:54.800]  that are in it but with this product you get large dosages of the most studied
[01:53:54.800 --> 01:54:01.880]  proven patented certified ingredients and that's why DNA Force plus is such a
[01:54:01.880 --> 01:54:07.760]  game changer it's been proven to be able to regrow nerves it's been proven to
[01:54:07.760 --> 01:54:12.760]  make telomeres last longer essentially making them grow it's half empty half
[01:54:12.760 --> 01:54:17.520]  full they don't shrink as fast it's been proven to clean out your mitochondrial
[01:54:17.520 --> 01:54:22.000]  DNA and I was sitting there about a month ago realizing when's the last time I
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.960]  took it when's the last time I took my X2 that goes with these cycles while try
[01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:29.480]  it I'll take it I'll lose weight I'll feel great and then I'll forget you've
[01:54:29.480 --> 01:54:34.840]  got to continually take it to have the role benefits and again any of these
[01:54:34.840 --> 01:54:41.000]  products take time to hit time to kick in they're not drugs some twisted thing
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:46.160]  made by scientists their mother nature that's what big pharma is trying to
[01:54:46.160 --> 01:54:52.040]  copy and trying to basically rip off but with all the side effects these don't
[01:54:52.040 --> 01:54:57.120]  have that ladies and gentlemen so let's look at some of these factoids or
[01:54:57.120 --> 01:55:02.440]  bragging rights as they are here on the piece of paper about DNA Force plus
[01:55:02.440 --> 01:55:08.320]  because even myself I'm asking myself why aren't I taking this every day why
[01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:11.960]  isn't my wife taking it every day we've been given such great gifts by God
[01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:16.800]  through mother nature that why wouldn't we take advantage of it so DNA Force here
[01:55:16.800 --> 01:55:21.360]  are some of the factoids here's some of the bragging points DNA Force plus was

[01:58:01.760 --> 01:58:06.160]  all happening the left are fascist authoritarians their bullies their
