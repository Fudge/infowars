[00:00.000 --> 00:27.400]  America and the rest of the free world is under massive globalist attack, but humanity
[00:27.400 --> 00:46.800]  is awakening and resisting, the battle is joined.
[00:46.800 --> 00:51.040]  It's now official, the United Nations is pushing global force inoculations to be able
[00:51.040 --> 00:56.800]  to travel or have a job that is as close as about six months away will show you other
[00:56.800 --> 00:57.800]  statements.
[00:57.800 --> 01:04.080]  Also, the federal government is public about financing major universities in brainwash
[01:04.080 --> 01:10.920]  training with focus groups how to mislead people and pressure them into taking the deadly
[01:10.920 --> 01:15.280]  COVID-19 vaccine that doesn't even protect you from COVID-19.
[01:15.280 --> 01:20.880]  That's all coming up, red flags soar as big pharma will be exempt from COVID-19 vaccine
[01:20.880 --> 01:21.880]  liability claims.
[01:21.880 --> 01:27.160]  Meanwhile, the UK government warns that the public is going to overthrow the government
[01:27.160 --> 01:30.040]  if they continue the lockdowns.
[01:30.040 --> 01:33.080]  That's their internal study show and that's documented here.
[01:33.080 --> 01:35.240]  Christians beat Newsom in his own game.
[01:35.240 --> 01:39.880]  500 people just show up on the beach for church services.
[01:39.880 --> 01:45.520]  As the churches are closed in many areas but not the anti-fariders, they're good Newsom
[01:45.520 --> 01:48.480]  says as well as Cuomo.
[01:48.480 --> 01:53.480]  Meanwhile, Atlas Gym owners in New Jersey break into their own business to let in customers.
[01:53.480 --> 01:58.560]  Again, violent in New Jersey's coronavirus orders and the same thing is happening in
[01:58.560 --> 01:59.560]  Germany.
[01:59.560 --> 02:04.640]  The same thing is happening all over Europe and the UK.
[02:04.640 --> 02:09.200]  People are refusing to submit to all of this.
[02:09.200 --> 02:14.760]  So that is the answer to their 1984 is 1776.
[02:14.760 --> 02:15.760]  Boom.
[02:15.760 --> 02:22.400]  The news gets even more incredible and even more amazing all over the world, all over
[02:22.400 --> 02:23.920]  Europe and the United States.
[02:23.920 --> 02:28.920]  Big crowds of people, hundreds and hundreds come out and protest.
[02:28.920 --> 02:34.200]  The globalist child kidnapping pedophile rings.
[02:34.200 --> 02:35.360]  It's happening in England.
[02:35.360 --> 02:36.360]  It's happening in Germany.
[02:36.360 --> 02:41.640]  It's happening in the United States and places like Salt Lake City and places like Arizona
[02:41.640 --> 02:45.000]  and Austin, Texas.
[02:45.000 --> 02:46.000]  It's happening.
[02:46.000 --> 02:51.240]  They're saying children's lives matter as we come together, not based on what color
[02:51.240 --> 02:58.840]  we are, but based on our spirit that has free will and is able to connect to the same creator.
[02:58.840 --> 03:01.640]  It is all coming up and then something even crazier.
[03:01.640 --> 03:07.200]  Why do I have a home defense shotgun right here in 12 gauge?
[03:07.200 --> 03:14.840]  Why do I have a nine millimeter Glock right here?
[03:14.840 --> 03:19.960]  Well, it's because that's the answer to people trying to hurt you in your car, your home
[03:19.960 --> 03:21.120]  and kill you.
[03:21.120 --> 03:25.400]  Your answer is when they come armed and point a weapon at you is to shoot them in the chest
[03:25.400 --> 03:35.440]  until they're on the ground and you're safe because officially, officially in Illinois,
[03:35.440 --> 03:41.920]  in Minnesota, in California and other areas, Attorney General's mayors and police chiefs
[03:41.920 --> 03:45.040]  are now saying, do not call the police if you're raped.
[03:45.040 --> 03:48.000]  I'm going to say, these are public state, these are videos.
[03:48.000 --> 03:50.520]  Rape is now good, liberal.
[03:50.520 --> 03:51.520]  Say let men rape you.
[03:51.520 --> 03:56.520]  You're understanding where they're going because these are Islamists.
[03:56.520 --> 04:02.360]  Mayor Lightfoot Chicago has 139% increase in murder and then this giant enchilada, it's
[04:02.360 --> 04:04.520]  on their local news.
[04:04.520 --> 04:09.680]  It's in the Minneapolis St. Paul paper, but here it is on infowars.com.
[04:09.680 --> 04:12.440]  Federalist police tell residents to surrender to criminals.
[04:12.440 --> 04:13.440]  These are quotes.
[04:13.440 --> 04:15.480]  Be prepared to get robbed.
[04:15.480 --> 04:16.480]  These are quotes.
[04:16.480 --> 04:17.920]  Do not argue or fight with the criminal.
[04:17.920 --> 04:19.800]  Do as they say.
[04:19.800 --> 04:23.040]  Do not be armed in your home or car.
[04:23.040 --> 04:24.280]  Submit to them.
[04:24.280 --> 04:25.960]  The police aren't going to arrest them now.
[04:25.960 --> 04:29.160]  They're being disbanded and their answer is submit.
[04:29.160 --> 04:31.480]  Well, you're not a police officer.
[04:31.480 --> 04:32.480]  You're not an American.
[04:32.480 --> 04:37.000]  You are a gilded Stockholm syndrome globalist who wants crime to explode everywhere for
[04:37.000 --> 04:40.120]  a fall of the country and then you're going to take over and set up permanent martial
[04:40.120 --> 04:41.120]  law.
[04:41.120 --> 04:42.120]  You know what you knew?
[04:42.120 --> 04:43.120]  Well, we're globalists are planning.
[04:43.120 --> 04:45.000]  You know, you're trying to encourage this.
[04:45.000 --> 04:46.520]  The criminals can go wild.
[04:46.520 --> 04:50.480]  I predict people aren't going to follow the garbage leptice rules and a bunch of these
[04:50.480 --> 04:52.720]  attempted carjackers are going to die.
[04:52.720 --> 04:54.080]  Well, they're not back.
[04:54.080 --> 04:55.280]  It's Sunday live.
[04:55.280 --> 04:59.360]  Stay with us.
[04:59.360 --> 05:02.280]  I have never been so concerned about what's going on.
[05:02.280 --> 05:05.320]  This is all martial law prepping, martial law training.
[05:05.320 --> 05:09.160]  And now they have activated the most criminal elements to deep state and Pelosi is bragging
[05:09.160 --> 05:13.440]  they're going to remove the president illegally with COG.
[05:13.440 --> 05:14.840]  You cannot remove the president with COG.
[05:14.840 --> 05:18.480]  You're going to remove the president 25th amendment or impeachment, but they're saying
[05:18.480 --> 05:19.960]  they're going to do it.
[05:19.960 --> 05:24.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, they are putting this in every newspaper in the country and legitimizing
[05:24.640 --> 05:27.960]  the fact that if he can test the election in any way, when they say by default, they
[05:27.960 --> 05:30.080]  are that they're going to pull this.
[05:30.080 --> 05:32.640]  This is maximum, maximum alert.
[05:32.640 --> 05:33.640]  This is emergency alert.
[05:33.640 --> 05:34.640]  Yes.
[05:34.640 --> 05:37.800]  We heard the Patriots off most of the internet, but Bandot video is still there.
[05:37.800 --> 05:38.800]  The radio show is still there.
[05:38.800 --> 05:42.120]  And yes, we're getting about five times the traffic we were getting before the ban to
[05:42.120 --> 05:43.120]  the actual sites.
[05:43.120 --> 05:46.960]  We need to get this message to other people outside of our audience.
[05:46.960 --> 05:51.040]  So tell everyone now about the martial law plan and the plan to get rid of Trump.
[05:51.040 --> 05:53.320]  It's all posted at Bandot video.
[05:53.320 --> 05:54.920]  Please, we can defeat these people.
[05:54.920 --> 05:57.320]  If you take action, you are the answer.
[05:57.320 --> 06:02.240]  Please, please, please.
[06:02.240 --> 06:03.880]  Big brother.
[06:03.880 --> 06:04.880]  We are live.
[06:04.880 --> 06:33.280]  We are broadcasting worldwide on this Sunday, August 2nd, 2020 transmission, 92 days out
[06:33.280 --> 06:37.520]  from our fate, destiny.
[06:37.520 --> 06:40.640]  The global is trying to take full control of the Republic.
[06:40.640 --> 06:44.080]  Well, if you're a TV viewer and on a radio listener, you probably noticed that I have
[06:44.080 --> 06:51.760]  a 12 gauge home defense shotgun right here and also have a nine millimeter Glock to my
[06:51.760 --> 06:52.760]  left.
[06:52.760 --> 06:59.520]  Now, the shotguns for your house or for your car, depending on your state laws, you don't
[06:59.520 --> 07:00.520]  want to kill your neighbors.
[07:00.520 --> 07:04.720]  You don't want to have double lock buckshot, so it kills the perpetrator, but it doesn't
[07:04.720 --> 07:09.600]  go through too far, travel too far, because after about 100 yards, it becomes a lot less
[07:09.600 --> 07:11.440]  lethal and doesn't have the penetrating power.
[07:11.440 --> 07:16.680]  Up close, nothing will blow somebody into pieces like 20 rounds of basically 22 ammunition.
[07:16.680 --> 07:19.760]  I guess this is what comes out of a buckshot of my memory serves right.
[07:19.760 --> 07:21.680]  Then a little nine millimeter handgun here.
[07:21.680 --> 07:22.680]  This is good for your house.
[07:22.680 --> 07:27.120]  It's also good for your car.
[07:27.120 --> 07:31.840]  And if you got organized communists and criminals like that, and there's a more organized attack
[07:31.840 --> 07:36.200]  on you, well, we've got other things, battle rifles to deal with that when we got 50 cows
[07:36.200 --> 07:41.120]  just in case they ever get the armored vehicles like we have, we're prepared because we understand
[07:41.120 --> 07:43.880]  the globalist threat and that they have their way.
[07:43.880 --> 07:48.080]  They're going to bring us into a hot civil war and then literally shin their Maoist brigades
[07:48.080 --> 07:52.200]  in and try to kill us.
[07:52.200 --> 07:53.200]  That's the real world.
[07:53.200 --> 07:56.880]  And people used to hear me talk about that, and they thought I was going too far, but
[07:56.880 --> 08:02.600]  now folks understand that we're not going too far and they can really see the attempts
[08:02.600 --> 08:06.280]  at destabilizing things and overthrowing things.
[08:06.280 --> 08:08.600]  Let me read to you some headlines.
[08:08.600 --> 08:12.240]  Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison says he doesn't want police officers responding
[08:12.240 --> 08:14.320]  to rape calls.
[08:14.320 --> 08:19.520]  He has been accused many times of raping women and of other criminal activity.
[08:19.520 --> 08:22.200]  Mayor Lori Lightfoot, he said that on video.
[08:22.200 --> 08:24.320]  That's not taken out of context.
[08:24.320 --> 08:33.960]  Lori Lightfoot sees Chicago hundred to 39% increase in murder in just the last two months.
[08:33.960 --> 08:34.960]  Think about that.
[08:34.960 --> 08:38.600]  Now look at this headline and this is on info wars.com.
[08:38.600 --> 08:39.600]  This is not a joke.
[08:39.600 --> 08:44.880]  This is an actual email sent out to everyone that had signed up in the last 20 years to
[08:44.880 --> 08:47.400]  the police email system to get alerts.
[08:47.400 --> 08:52.320]  Minneapolis police tell residents to surrender to criminals and be prepared to get robbed.
[08:52.320 --> 09:00.200]  Do not argue or fight with the criminal, do as they say reads the police email.
[09:00.200 --> 09:05.440]  That is on info wars.com with a direct post to the email and the police department site
[09:05.440 --> 09:07.600]  where it actually says it.
[09:07.600 --> 09:10.360]  Nowhere does it say have a firearm.
[09:10.360 --> 09:11.920]  Nowhere does it tell you to have a taser.
[09:11.920 --> 09:13.240]  Nowhere does it tell you to have a stun gun.
[09:13.240 --> 09:18.800]  Nowhere does it tell you to have bear spray or illegal knife.
[09:18.800 --> 09:22.960]  No, you need to learn how to bend over properly.
[09:22.960 --> 09:29.320]  Now this is what we talk about being psychological Stockholm syndrome, learned helplessness and
[09:29.320 --> 09:33.240]  the Overton window being moved to the point where we totally submit to tyranny and being
[09:33.240 --> 09:38.760]  oppressed and the psychological war chiefs that run things are testing us to see what
[09:38.760 --> 09:43.800]  we'll put up with and what we'll do and what we'll go along with.
[09:43.800 --> 09:47.640]  The answer to this is to say, no, I'm not submitting.
[09:47.640 --> 09:59.520]  Amazon and Walmart and Piggly Wiggly are essential, but your coffee shop, your store
[09:59.520 --> 10:04.240]  is not and half the small businesses in America have shuttered their doors so far.
[10:04.240 --> 10:06.640]  Many never to reopen.
[10:06.640 --> 10:09.400]  There's an incredible video posted on info wars.com.
[10:09.400 --> 10:15.520]  Donald Trump's also tweeted at our president of 40 million Americans out of work and the
[10:15.520 --> 10:17.840]  Jeff Bezos profits go straight up.
[10:17.840 --> 10:22.880]  Well, that's what the club of Rome and Bilderberg group and Davos have all talked about.
[10:22.880 --> 10:27.360]  In the new robot takeover, they build a system where humans are obsolete and they just say,
[10:27.360 --> 10:29.120]  oh, because we're not building a future for you.
[10:29.120 --> 10:34.600]  Well, why would we let people build a future that isn't pro human that they claim is good
[10:34.600 --> 10:36.160]  for the earth and all this crap.
[10:36.160 --> 10:40.520]  These are just supervillains, ladies and gentlemen that use psychology to control you.
[10:40.520 --> 10:47.600]  But the minute you become aware of that and understand that the ultra rich are the ones
[10:47.600 --> 10:52.960]  pushing communism and socialism for you because they're exempt from an offshore and the wage
[10:52.960 --> 10:59.800]  disparity and earning disparity has gone where the top 10% had half the wealth 30 years
[10:59.800 --> 11:00.800]  ago.
[11:00.800 --> 11:06.600]  Now it's the top one 10th of one percent, not the one percent, but less than a hundred
[11:06.600 --> 11:12.320]  people actually it's a tiny fraction have more than half the wealth in the world.
[11:12.320 --> 11:16.440]  So they teach you in Bezos and Buffett and all of them are always we to raise taxes
[11:16.440 --> 11:17.440]  on rich people.
[11:17.440 --> 11:21.800]  They call that someone making $150,000 a year because they're exempt from it and siphon
[11:21.800 --> 11:24.520]  off in government programs and kickbacks.
[11:24.520 --> 11:30.600]  Bezos got $32 billion of the stimulus money.
[11:30.600 --> 11:33.720]  Most small businesses couldn't even ever get on the computer to log on.
[11:33.720 --> 11:34.720]  It wouldn't let them in.
[11:34.720 --> 11:39.560]  Some people tried thousands of times and of course the government offices are closed
[11:39.560 --> 11:40.920]  so you can't go complain.
[11:40.920 --> 11:45.000]  This is all a designed giant fraud.
[11:45.000 --> 11:46.000]  Trump's figured it out.
[11:46.000 --> 11:47.000]  He's trying to turn things back on.
[11:47.000 --> 11:49.000]  They're not letting them.
[11:49.000 --> 11:53.760]  But imagine Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison says he doesn't want police officers
[11:53.760 --> 11:55.520]  responding to rape calls.
[11:55.520 --> 11:59.640]  He said that in a TV interview that this came out earlier in the week.
[11:59.640 --> 12:00.640]  I never played the clip.
[12:00.640 --> 12:09.120]  I find that clip, I saw it earlier this week, last week, because it dovetails with the Minnesota
[12:09.120 --> 12:16.680]  police saying, Minneapolis police, surrender to criminals and be prepared to get robbed.
[12:16.680 --> 12:19.960]  Do not argue or fight with a criminal.
[12:19.960 --> 12:22.760]  Read the email from the police chief.
[12:22.760 --> 12:23.760]  Think about that.
[12:23.760 --> 12:26.880]  Meanwhile, this is in Fox News as of last night.
[12:26.880 --> 12:29.680]  We broke it here at InfoWars with the original report.
[12:29.680 --> 12:34.280]  Austin police warned of arm rioters planning to access buildings, reports armed gun trucks.
[12:34.280 --> 12:35.520]  They did try all that.
[12:35.520 --> 12:40.200]  They had gun trucks but the police shadowed them instead of you raise your firearms, prepare
[12:40.200 --> 12:41.480]  to die.
[12:41.480 --> 12:45.680]  And so Antifa pissed down their leg and scurried back off in the darkness.
[12:45.680 --> 12:50.400]  But meanwhile in Portland, Oregon, left us burned Bibles, U.S. flags in front of federal
[12:50.400 --> 12:54.760]  courthouses.
[12:54.760 --> 12:56.320]  That's right.
[12:56.320 --> 12:57.760]  All that video of them.
[12:57.760 --> 13:03.080]  Now, police rescue pig from Portland left us who were planning to behead it in front
[13:03.080 --> 13:07.880]  of the police station.
[13:07.880 --> 13:12.240]  He's selling some really nice people, aren't they?
[13:12.240 --> 13:14.320]  But we're in the Stockholm syndrome.
[13:14.320 --> 13:20.720]  We submit to it because they roll this communist globalist takeover in the shell, in the packaging
[13:20.720 --> 13:24.760]  that it's about empowering minorities.
[13:24.760 --> 13:28.560]  And we've got the U.N. saying we're going to have replacement migration, 200 million
[13:28.560 --> 13:31.640]  into France alone, 600 million into the U.S. and they're going to teach the people that
[13:31.640 --> 13:36.040]  aren't white when they come in that whiteness is bad and the West is bad, Christianity is
[13:36.040 --> 13:41.720]  bad and organize them politically around race while they beg and fight to get in here
[13:41.720 --> 13:43.120]  close to the white devils.
[13:43.120 --> 13:45.960]  But again, it's the globalist manipulating all this.
[13:45.960 --> 13:49.520]  Who are the paramilitary forces marching in the streets in the U.K.?
[13:49.520 --> 13:54.040]  Well, they are the African liberation movement.
[13:54.040 --> 14:00.840]  The African emancipation group demanding that unlimited amounts of people will be brought
[14:00.840 --> 14:03.160]  in and have everything free.
[14:03.160 --> 14:07.400]  That's what George Soros is funding, why he funds the Zodiac boats and the debit cards
[14:07.400 --> 14:08.400]  we're about to get in.
[14:08.400 --> 14:11.840]  And they're in the U.K. and they're pissed and they are attacking police and they are
[14:11.840 --> 14:14.480]  God and you better give them something.
[14:14.480 --> 14:16.000]  This is the class warfare.
[14:16.000 --> 14:19.000]  Could we bring in all the people from the third world and get along with them if they
[14:19.000 --> 14:21.520]  adopted Christianity and adopted the Western culture?
[14:21.520 --> 14:22.520]  Absolutely.
[14:22.520 --> 14:26.840]  If we feel full of Western hate and feel full of New World Order George Soros crap, we will
[14:26.840 --> 14:29.200]  be destroyed and we are being destroyed.
[14:29.200 --> 14:36.880]  And it's all the little white professor-minders that are coming in and organizing the minorities
[14:36.880 --> 14:38.880]  to be race-based.
[14:38.880 --> 14:39.880]  It is a New World Order takedown.
[14:39.880 --> 14:41.120]  It's their admitted plan.
[14:41.120 --> 14:46.400]  We're idiots if we grovel to go, I'm not racist, I love you, I'm sorry, I'm white.
[14:46.400 --> 14:50.360]  That only encourages the delusions of the types of idiots that buy into Black Lives
[14:50.360 --> 14:52.720]  Matter and Antifa.
[14:52.720 --> 14:58.400]  Now continuing, we have to end the July sale today.
[14:58.400 --> 15:01.520]  I have a couple of new specials we're going to launch tomorrow, but the free shipping
[15:01.520 --> 15:02.520]  will end tomorrow.
[15:02.520 --> 15:06.920]  I've got to up the price on the privacy pocket because we're just not making enough money
[15:06.920 --> 15:12.960]  on it in 1995 to be able to use our great units to be able to run the operation.
[15:12.960 --> 15:16.200]  And so that's going to go up in price tomorrow, five bucks, and I know you understand we need
[15:16.200 --> 15:17.200]  to find the operation.
[15:17.200 --> 15:21.920]  We're going to have to end the bodies 50% off, live in defense 50% off, vasomy 50% off,
[15:21.920 --> 15:24.680]  parabolic force 50% off, vitamin refusible 50% off.
[15:24.680 --> 15:25.920]  All those are selling out.
[15:25.920 --> 15:27.920]  These others aren't selling out.
[15:27.920 --> 15:32.600]  We have enough to keep them on sale right now, more in coming in for months.
[15:32.600 --> 15:38.600]  Survival Shield X2, X3, Lung Cleanse, Ultra 12, DNA Force Plus, Winner Sun Plus, Chill
[15:38.600 --> 15:44.640]  Force, Superfumilatality, Bowdre Selenium, and Extend-A-Wise will stay on sale at 50%
[15:44.640 --> 15:45.640]  off.
[15:45.640 --> 15:49.360]  Not free shipping, we just have done the accounting and it didn't bring enough revenue.
[15:49.360 --> 15:50.360]  Thank you all for your support.
[15:50.360 --> 15:52.200]  These are great products you already need.

[15:53.200 --> 15:54.200]  That's how we defeat the globalists.
[15:54.200 --> 15:58.240]  And spread the word about the live broadcast, huge news straight ahead.
[15:58.240 --> 16:03.680]  I'm really, really proud of the Dr. Jones Naturals, activated charcoal, naturally fluoride-free,
[16:03.680 --> 16:05.560]  mouthwash, and toothpaste.
[16:05.560 --> 16:09.120]  And if you don't know what activated charcoal does, ladies and gentlemen, it naturally,
[16:09.120 --> 16:15.160]  in a clean way, strips away the toxins, the impurities, the plaque, and it doesn't damage
[16:15.160 --> 16:16.160]  the enamel.
[16:16.160 --> 16:17.160]  That's really important.

[16:39.120 --> 16:42.720]  I believe you're going to like this as much as the other toothpaste, maybe even more.
[16:42.720 --> 16:47.680]  Over a year ago, I tried charcoal toothpaste with a major brand and thought it was amazing.
[16:47.680 --> 16:50.520]  And I went to my dad and people said, I would like to put out a charcoal toothpaste that
[16:50.520 --> 16:52.520]  doesn't have all the silica and all these fillers in it.
[16:52.520 --> 16:53.520]  Very strong toothpaste.
[16:53.520 --> 16:55.320]  You've never used anything like it.
[16:55.320 --> 16:58.800]  Get yours at InfoWareStore.com right now.
[16:58.800 --> 17:01.160]  A lot of you have been listening for more than 20 years.
[17:01.160 --> 17:06.320]  And if you go back to those shows, we laid out the AI takeover plan, the tracking of
[17:06.320 --> 17:12.880]  cell phones, how programmed master computers would manipulate control society, how they'd
[17:12.880 --> 17:17.960]  be able to not just predict large groups of human movements and activities, but even
[17:17.960 --> 17:19.560]  predict what individuals would do.
[17:19.560 --> 17:24.280]  And then once you could predict what individuals were going to be doing, you could add stimuli
[17:24.280 --> 17:30.160]  through the AI systems, through the computers, through digital billboards, through face scanning,
[17:30.160 --> 17:34.040]  through the social credit score to control people and make them act like you want it
[17:34.040 --> 17:35.040]  to.
[17:35.040 --> 17:38.760]  And to cover that, the media would attack us and say, we were making it up.
[17:38.760 --> 17:43.360]  It was a conspiracy theory, even though it was in the actual corporate level blueprint
[17:43.360 --> 17:44.360]  documents.
[17:44.360 --> 17:48.440]  Well, the next level of the blueprint documents explained to us that they are setting up this
[17:48.440 --> 17:51.920]  control system to make humans obsolete and phase us out.
[17:51.920 --> 17:55.760]  And it's something about a thousand times crazier than what Hitler planned.
[17:55.760 --> 17:58.960]  So we might want to dismantle the system now.
[17:58.960 --> 18:06.320]  There are only a few days left to take advantage of the biggest info war sale of 2020 so far.
[18:06.320 --> 18:10.640]  It is Christmas in July and July ends this Friday.
[18:10.640 --> 18:16.360]  The longest we can run it is a few extra days until Sunday because we are selling out of
[18:16.360 --> 18:21.920]  almost all of our best selling products and the supply chain is breaking down with many
[18:21.920 --> 18:23.840]  of our manufacturers.
[18:23.840 --> 18:27.760]  And so a lot of the reorders are held up months.
[18:27.760 --> 18:33.720]  In many cases, this could be the last chance you've got in the year 2020 to get these amazing
[18:33.720 --> 18:38.480]  products that empower you and your family's life and health, your immune systems, you
[18:38.480 --> 18:46.120]  name it, your stamina, your libido, your focus, but also, you know, funds the info war and
[18:46.120 --> 18:50.000]  everything we're doing to save this republic from the clutches of the globalist in the
[18:50.000 --> 18:51.000]  new world order.
[18:51.000 --> 18:55.840]  All of our best selling items, 50% off, store it for shipping, double page reports, take
[18:55.840 --> 18:59.800]  advantage of it right now while there's still time.
[18:59.800 --> 19:09.320]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy and overall wellness.
[19:09.320 --> 19:17.080]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date, super male vitality, specifically
[19:17.080 --> 19:24.120]  designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality
[19:24.120 --> 19:25.120]  in males.
[19:25.120 --> 19:31.080]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains
[19:31.080 --> 19:35.760]  no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[19:35.760 --> 19:36.760]  Yes.
[19:36.760 --> 19:43.320]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology working together in
[19:43.320 --> 19:48.360]  perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb packed formula.
[19:48.360 --> 19:49.880]  So what are you waiting for?
[19:49.880 --> 19:54.840]  Go to the info war store, never been a better time than right now.
[19:54.840 --> 20:01.400]  Remember male vitality at infostore.com.
[20:01.400 --> 20:30.400]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:32.400 --> 20:39.040]  Here's the attorney general of Minnesota, a globalist, communist on record who at least
[20:39.040 --> 20:44.400]  four women have accused of raping or assaulting them.
[20:44.400 --> 20:50.120]  And it's okay though because he's got brown skin so it's all right if he goes on TV and
[20:50.120 --> 20:56.280]  says abolish the police and now says if somebody rapes you, don't call the police, call a counselor.
[20:56.280 --> 20:57.280]  Here it is.
[20:57.280 --> 21:03.760]  If you're a woman who's been a victim of a sexual assault and the assailant is ran away,
[21:03.760 --> 21:10.720]  wouldn't you rather talk to somebody who is trained in helping you deal with what you're
[21:10.720 --> 21:18.000]  dealing with as opposed to somebody whose main training is that they know how to use
[21:18.000 --> 21:22.040]  a firearm, right?
[21:22.040 --> 21:23.880]  And of course he loves anti-fuse as well.
[21:23.880 --> 21:29.560]  So let's explain, the police do not have a responsibility to protect us and they can't.
[21:29.560 --> 21:31.360]  That's in the law.
[21:31.360 --> 21:35.840]  The police have a job that once a crime is committed, we hire them to bring the criminal
[21:35.840 --> 21:41.760]  because we have evidence to a magistrate and a court and then they can be indicted so they
[21:41.760 --> 21:45.560]  can have a jury trial.
[21:45.560 --> 21:51.680]  And if you let people rape and murder, the rapists will commit 10, 20, 30 times the crime
[21:51.680 --> 21:56.960]  especially, you know, in the Walla Wall West in a town, you'd have a lot of raping and
[21:56.960 --> 22:00.400]  killing, contrary to the Hollywood movies, actually very low crime rates in most areas.
[22:00.400 --> 22:01.920]  They had some crime zones.
[22:01.920 --> 22:06.040]  You'd have a street where it was prostitution and gambling and drinking and you might have
[22:06.040 --> 22:07.480]  somebody shot there every weekend.
[22:07.480 --> 22:11.040]  But you'd have five or six other streets where nothing ever happened.
[22:11.040 --> 22:15.520]  You know, in towns like Dodge or something that had like 20,000, 30,000, 100,000 people
[22:15.520 --> 22:17.080]  in it depending on what year.
[22:17.080 --> 22:21.320]  But the idea of like the Westerns where they shoot them up every week, that's not true.
[22:21.320 --> 22:24.760]  In fact, shoot them up for famous, they got written about newspapers when they did happen
[22:24.760 --> 22:28.920]  because they were so rare, big ones, like the OK Corral, that's like five or six people
[22:28.920 --> 22:35.560]  getting shot, big deal compared to the numbers we see today in Chicago and other areas.
[22:35.560 --> 22:41.280]  If you don't have the right to defend yourself though, crime becomes insane like the French
[22:41.280 --> 22:43.120]  Revolution.
[22:43.120 --> 22:46.840]  The French didn't have a right to keep their arms and protect themselves, only the nobility
[22:46.840 --> 22:47.840]  did.
[22:47.840 --> 22:53.920]  When criminals took over government, they estimate crime went up in France probably 30,000 percentage
[22:53.920 --> 22:54.920]  points.
[22:54.920 --> 22:59.800]  It went from being very rare to just blood in the streets, hundreds of thousands being
[22:59.800 --> 23:07.000]  killed every month, just charnel house, devil worship, child molestation, human sacrificing,
[23:07.000 --> 23:08.400]  that's who ran the French Revolution.
[23:08.400 --> 23:09.400]  We're devil worshipers.
[23:09.400 --> 23:10.520]  The Jacobins, look it up.
[23:10.520 --> 23:16.800]  The left hand path and then communism and then Antifa on record comes out of that.
[23:16.800 --> 23:20.840]  So you wonder why they're devil worshiping and burning Bibles and killing animals and
[23:20.840 --> 23:30.160]  sacrifices in the streets and erecting statues to Satan because we've seen this movie before
[23:30.160 --> 23:34.600]  and those of us who know history are fascinated by it, we want to learn more, we know what's
[23:34.600 --> 23:37.120]  going to happen next because we've read history.
[23:37.120 --> 23:39.240]  When history does what, it repeats.
[23:39.240 --> 23:41.360]  If it does anything.
[23:41.360 --> 23:44.280]  And now we're facing the very same thing.
[23:44.280 --> 23:50.160]  I mean, some days in France, it was estimated that 5,000 people would have their heads chopped
[23:50.160 --> 23:55.360]  off in one day and it was mainly just people that even commoners that shot their mouths
[23:55.360 --> 23:57.240]  off to the devil worshipers.
[23:57.240 --> 24:01.320]  But let's just stop for a moment.
[24:01.320 --> 24:04.480]  This is Stockholm syndrome.
[24:04.480 --> 24:13.280]  If you just call the counselor, well, they're going to call the police, maybe, but see the
[24:13.280 --> 24:16.400]  police are saying they're not going to respond anymore in Minneapolis and other areas.
[24:16.400 --> 24:20.040]  So they're actually not going to respond and they'll just tell you, it's okay, whoever
[24:20.040 --> 24:22.320]  this is that raped you and now he'll come back and do it again.
[24:22.320 --> 24:23.320]  You know what?
[24:23.320 --> 24:27.200]  I tell a woman, somebody came and raped you, I'd say call the police, prosecute them and
[24:27.200 --> 24:33.400]  I said, go to a local gun shop that's highly rated and buy a $300, $400 revolver because
[24:33.400 --> 24:34.400]  it's very easy to use.
[24:34.400 --> 24:35.400]  You're not going to have a problem.
[24:35.400 --> 24:40.480]  It's the first time gun owner and you go to the shooting range with somebody that sells
[24:40.480 --> 24:45.040]  it to you and take a couple lessons and you'll load it up and shoot it and go, my God, this
[24:45.040 --> 24:49.000]  is easier than brushing my teeth.
[24:49.000 --> 24:51.200]  Women are just as good as shots as men statistically.
[24:51.200 --> 24:52.200]  In fact, a lot of times better.
[24:52.200 --> 24:54.440]  I mean, my wife's not even a big gun person.
[24:54.440 --> 25:00.760]  She shoots as good as I do with MP5, Remington 700s, shotguns, I mean, she'll be at 100 yards
[25:00.760 --> 25:05.520]  shooting through the same hole with my M4.
[25:05.520 --> 25:06.520]  Same hole.
[25:06.520 --> 25:09.120]  Oh, women shouldn't have that.
[25:09.120 --> 25:10.880]  You're a little lady, you can't handle that.
[25:10.880 --> 25:19.200]  A woman should have a revolver until they get good with it and then get yourself a regular
[25:19.200 --> 25:25.600]  handgun that has a few other functions to it, period.
[25:25.600 --> 25:27.240]  And they want you to be helpless though.
[25:27.240 --> 25:34.920]  You think about the evil of all over the country, Democrats who have armed guards in Minneapolis
[25:34.920 --> 25:39.600]  now, they have a huge multi-million dollar budget for private security as they cut back
[25:39.600 --> 25:46.200]  the police force for the city council, their own private royal guard.
[25:46.200 --> 25:52.040]  They've got 24 hour guards at their dirty filthy communist houses while they defund the police
[25:52.040 --> 26:00.160]  for everybody else and the crime rate jumps over 150% in Minneapolis alone, 130% in Chicago.
[26:00.160 --> 26:04.800]  That's more than double.
[26:04.800 --> 26:08.000]  Think about these people and Ilhan Omar will play a clip of her in a moment.
[26:08.000 --> 26:13.880]  This monster saved from Somalia where her slave trade family, by the way, was being
[26:13.880 --> 26:17.800]  destroyed by another tribe.
[26:17.800 --> 26:24.160]  She came here two years before Mogadishu in black lock down and she attacks the men of
[26:24.160 --> 26:29.360]  the army in speeches and say they were killers and horrible and bad, literally trying to
[26:29.360 --> 26:35.960]  get food delivered to people under attack and being killed by the other main tribe.
[26:35.960 --> 26:39.720]  The scum of the earth, you save this monster.
[26:39.720 --> 26:47.140]  You take this viper, this scorpion to your breast and it stings you.
[26:47.140 --> 26:49.160]  She wants you to have Stockholm syndrome.
[26:49.160 --> 26:50.160]  Look up what it is.
[26:50.160 --> 26:53.120]  It's where you learn to submit to your abusers and learn to help us.
[26:53.120 --> 26:54.360]  We'll talk more about it when we come back.
[26:54.360 --> 26:59.000]  But I got a bunch of COVID-19 news, a bunch of pedophile ring news, a bunch of the latest
[26:59.000 --> 27:02.600]  on Bill Clinton and the Epstein Island caught red handed there and trying to deny it.
[27:02.600 --> 27:04.280]  I mean, the wheels are coming off the new world order.
[27:04.280 --> 27:10.000]  But imagine being a monster, a communist, globalist monster who's never had a real
[27:10.000 --> 27:14.640]  job in her life, who siphoned off millions of dollars to all these different husbands
[27:14.640 --> 27:21.200]  she's got and who says this country sucked when it scooped her up out of the most hellish
[27:21.200 --> 27:26.120]  country in Africa, probably the world where they have sex slavery for women and their
[27:26.120 --> 27:30.640]  main system is still slavery and piracy.
[27:30.640 --> 27:37.760]  And we save her and we elect her and she attacks us.
[27:37.760 --> 27:40.840]  Listen to this monster.
[27:40.840 --> 27:47.880]  Never stop saying not only do we need to invest for him please, but we need to completely
[27:47.880 --> 27:50.880]  dismantle the Minneapolis police department.
[27:50.880 --> 28:05.640]  The Minneapolis police department is rotten to the root.
[28:05.640 --> 28:11.760]  And so when we dismantle it, we get rid of that cancer and we allow for something beautiful
[28:11.760 --> 28:19.440]  to rise and that we imagining allows us to figure out what public safety looks like for
[28:19.440 --> 28:20.440]  us.
[28:20.440 --> 28:22.040]  We want her in charge of the police.
[28:22.040 --> 28:28.120]  You talk about frightening, you talk about delusional crazy people, all funded by Gates,
[28:28.120 --> 28:31.160]  the UN, replacement migration.
[28:31.160 --> 28:34.560]  This is just a nightmare scenario, ladies and gentlemen.
[28:34.560 --> 28:35.560]  Unbelievable.
[28:35.560 --> 28:39.120]  All right, we'll get more into this later.
[28:39.120 --> 28:41.440]  I've got to get into the huge news.
[28:41.440 --> 28:44.720]  Gates got caught with the federal government running a brainwashing camp where they're
[28:44.720 --> 28:50.000]  testing how to brainwash people to take COVID-19 shots and then become contact tracers once
[28:50.000 --> 28:51.000]  they join the cult.
[28:51.000 --> 28:52.000]  Oh, yeah.
[28:52.000 --> 28:53.000]  Wait till you see this.
[28:53.000 --> 28:54.000]  We'll be right back.
[28:54.000 --> 29:04.080]  The BBC is state-run media in the UK and they've come out with a detailed article that's linked
[29:04.080 --> 29:10.480]  to an info wars dot com saying you will have to have forced inoculations multiple times
[29:10.480 --> 29:15.960]  a year to be able to travel, robots will scan you when you land, you will have a digital
[29:15.960 --> 29:20.640]  tattoo under your skin to be able to enter the country, but it's going to be so easy
[29:20.640 --> 29:22.720]  and so cool and so fun.
[29:22.720 --> 29:26.760]  The Microsoft website now officially has announced the digital tattoo.
[29:26.760 --> 29:30.600]  We exposed this six months ago and Bill Gates was funding it and they had hundreds of news
[29:30.600 --> 29:33.400]  articles attacking and saying it wasn't true.
[29:33.400 --> 29:35.160]  This is a tactic they use.
[29:35.160 --> 29:36.160]  First they announce it.
[29:36.160 --> 29:37.160]  We say it's a bad idea.
[29:37.160 --> 29:38.160]  They say that's crazy.
[29:38.160 --> 29:39.160]  We didn't do it.
[29:39.160 --> 29:40.160]  They introduce the idea to you.
[29:40.160 --> 29:43.840]  Then they come back and announce it again thinking you have no memory.
[29:43.840 --> 29:46.120]  This is a criminal takeover.
[29:46.120 --> 29:48.240]  This is the line in the sand.
[29:48.240 --> 29:49.400]  We must say no.
[29:49.400 --> 29:51.840]  We must expose the fraud of COVID-19.
[29:51.840 --> 29:54.200]  This entire house of evil is built on.
[29:54.200 --> 29:55.360]  I'm Alex Jones.
[29:55.360 --> 29:58.960]  Never surrender to tyranny in full wars dot com.
[29:58.960 --> 30:00.520]  The people are awakening.
[30:00.520 --> 30:03.680]  They're taking control of their own environment.
[30:03.680 --> 30:05.400]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[30:05.400 --> 30:10.440]  Really they're a super computer that's handheld, but big tech, large corporations, hackers,
[30:10.440 --> 30:15.000]  governments, foreign governments, the chai comms especially, are using this to steal
[30:15.000 --> 30:19.680]  your data, to share your data, to be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop
[30:19.680 --> 30:24.560]  up billions of people's data that can actually predict on record what's going to happen in
[30:24.560 --> 30:25.560]  mass movements.
[30:25.560 --> 30:32.600]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[30:32.600 --> 30:33.920]  In their own words, they admit it.
[30:33.920 --> 30:37.800]  So I've been selling privacy pouches and pocket pockets and things like that for more
[30:37.800 --> 30:38.960]  than a decade.
[30:38.960 --> 30:40.920]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight.
[30:40.920 --> 30:41.920]  They're Faraday cages.
[30:41.920 --> 30:43.640]  They just look like a cloth envelope.
[30:43.640 --> 30:48.280]  They work absolutely great and it just gives you that security to have power over your
[30:48.280 --> 30:52.680]  data and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't want big brother
[30:52.680 --> 30:54.760]  to know what you're up to because it's not their business.
[30:54.760 --> 30:57.240]  Get yours at infowarstore.com today.
[30:57.240 --> 31:24.840]  We can't survive without pure clean drinking water, so make sure that it's always available
[31:24.840 --> 31:54.280]  to you.
[31:55.160 --> 31:57.920]  Other systems just don't compare.
[31:57.920 --> 32:02.760]  The reasons that the globalist launched this planetary lockdown.
[32:02.760 --> 32:07.040]  The number one reason is it serves every one of their purposes.
[32:07.040 --> 32:11.440]  We've gone over those purposes many times here on air.
[32:11.440 --> 32:15.840]  The casual society, the surveillance system, global government, medical tyranny, forced
[32:15.840 --> 32:16.840]  inoculation.
[32:16.840 --> 32:24.520]  But the most important facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete, that we are non-essential
[32:24.520 --> 32:31.040]  as we begin to witness automation computers and robots take over the jobs that people
[32:31.040 --> 32:33.040]  once had by design.
[32:33.040 --> 32:37.840]  This isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into.
[32:37.840 --> 32:43.200]  It's been preplanned, organized globally, and it's extremely predatory.
[32:43.200 --> 32:48.600]  And through governmental actuaries and tax programs and regulations, the central banks
[32:48.600 --> 32:55.080]  that control it all are able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power.
[32:55.080 --> 33:22.280]  This is the truest form of technocracy fascism.
[33:25.080 --> 33:36.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back.
[33:36.280 --> 33:40.000]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Sunday Transmission.
[33:40.000 --> 33:47.200]  So you've got major globalist corporations that have been able to buy control of the
[33:47.200 --> 33:54.600]  planet because they control the fiat currency that is being released out to everybody.
[33:54.600 --> 34:00.600]  And so they can condition and control other corporations and other companies because if
[34:00.600 --> 34:09.280]  they don't follow the political and socioeconomic and cultural edicts of the ruling globalist,
[34:09.280 --> 34:12.640]  then they will have their money cut off and they will be punished.
[34:12.640 --> 34:18.120]  And so that's why you see the corporations and the NFL and the NBA and all of it lockstep
[34:18.120 --> 34:23.120]  in anti-Americanism, but saying communist China with millions in death camps is great.
[34:23.120 --> 34:24.800]  Because they're not liberals.
[34:24.800 --> 34:31.160]  They're authoritarians hiding their fascism, their communism, their dehumanization under
[34:31.160 --> 34:35.720]  neoliberal packaging.
[34:35.720 --> 34:40.000]  And Jay Dyer, who's a great author and researcher, hosted an hour of the show last week.
[34:40.000 --> 34:42.960]  I didn't have time to watch it until this morning I watched it.
[34:42.960 --> 34:47.160]  And I knew a lot of the stuff he was covering from previous books that the globalists had
[34:47.160 --> 34:50.480]  put out, Ziggler Brzezinski and many others.
[34:50.480 --> 34:56.480]  And he was reading books by the head of the Davos group, passages about we'll use a global
[34:56.480 --> 35:01.720]  crisis, probably a virus to lock down the whole economy and train people to go to a
[35:01.720 --> 35:03.280]  post-human economy.
[35:03.280 --> 35:07.800]  And then once humans are obsolete, we can just sterilize everybody and the human species
[35:07.800 --> 35:09.920]  is bad and merge with machines.
[35:09.920 --> 35:14.920]  But just to see the head of the Davos group saying that, when I already knew that was
[35:14.920 --> 35:20.800]  their plan, and then to see the Wall Street Journal a month ago, dreaming of the post-human
[35:20.800 --> 35:27.000]  future, dreaming of a world without humans, NBC headline, on the top of the website, the
[35:27.000 --> 35:32.040]  front page of the Wall Street Journal, the front page of NBC News, dreaming of the end
[35:32.040 --> 35:38.280]  of humanity, the post-human world, and the book shaping the future of the fourth industrial
[35:38.280 --> 35:40.200]  revolution, Klaus Schwab.
[35:40.200 --> 35:48.280]  I've got to read it because he was reading quotes of it.
[35:48.280 --> 35:52.400]  And it's the same stuff I've heard over and over again, but he was being absolutely direct
[35:52.400 --> 35:55.600]  about it's our job to save the planet and get rid of all humans.
[35:55.600 --> 36:00.440]  I mean, you might as well have aliens land and talk like this and you're reading the
[36:00.440 --> 36:05.920]  public Bilderberg group and what they want to do, they do.
[36:05.920 --> 36:09.800]  And so we're looking at the Minneapolis police saying, we can't protect you, submit the
[36:09.800 --> 36:11.600]  criminals, hand everything over.
[36:11.600 --> 36:17.720]  And we look at the Minnesota Attorney General saying, if you get raped, don't call the police.
[36:17.720 --> 36:21.240]  And you know, this doesn't make sense because they're taking everything away.
[36:21.240 --> 36:25.560]  They're getting you used to outrage, satanic idols put up at your churches.
[36:25.560 --> 36:31.680]  Your churches are closed, but the communists can rampage and attack the police.
[36:31.680 --> 36:35.920]  It's not that the old system's perfect, it's that it's pro-human and we built it.
[36:35.920 --> 36:38.960]  The globalist might as well be aliens, folks.
[36:38.960 --> 36:42.840]  They're so anti-human.
[36:42.840 --> 36:48.320]  And what they're building is just absolute pure evil.
[36:48.320 --> 36:49.320]  So I'm not helpless.
[36:49.320 --> 36:54.080]  You know, I've told my wife, I've told the crew, I've said, sometimes if you're in emergency,
[36:54.080 --> 36:57.680]  you can only order something from Amazon.
[36:57.680 --> 36:58.680]  You can do it.
[36:58.680 --> 37:01.600]  But I said, you can almost always find it somewhere else for the same price or a little
[37:01.600 --> 37:02.600]  bit more.
[37:02.600 --> 37:07.400]  And I said, you understand, Amazon's a strategically developed global operation to destroy even
[37:07.400 --> 37:11.160]  Walmart, not just mom and pops, and consolidate total power and control.
[37:11.160 --> 37:15.040]  Like Apple is the symbol of an apple being bitten, you know, in the Garden of Eden, well,
[37:15.040 --> 37:17.400]  their symbol's a devil tail.
[37:17.400 --> 37:19.920]  Buy their fruits that you will know them.
[37:19.920 --> 37:24.800]  And see, it's Stockholm syndrome to love it and think it's your friend and to go along
[37:24.800 --> 37:31.040]  with it when all it's doing is creating a post-human world.
[37:31.040 --> 37:32.920]  And that's why we're taught to hate ourselves.
[37:32.920 --> 37:34.840]  It's why we're taught that America sucks.
[37:34.840 --> 37:36.320]  It's why you're taught that humans are bad.
[37:36.320 --> 37:41.560]  It's so an evil group of people will have you just basically commit cultural suicide
[37:41.560 --> 37:46.480]  and stand down so they rule you, so they can get rid of you.
[37:46.480 --> 37:50.920]  They're saying the future doesn't need us in Wired Magazine and how the elite planned
[37:50.920 --> 37:53.920]  to get rid of us 21 years ago, and I made a big deal out of that.
[37:53.920 --> 37:58.400]  Bill Joy, owner of some microsystems, went to a meeting of billionaires.
[37:58.400 --> 38:02.800]  The top of tech, and he said, after a two-day summit, we decided we're going to kill everybody.
[38:02.800 --> 38:07.080]  We're going to set up a world government, have robots take over, self-driving cars,
[38:07.080 --> 38:11.240]  poison everybody, and then wipe your asses out, because we're not going to let you just
[38:11.240 --> 38:13.800]  party on some mythical cruise ship.
[38:13.800 --> 38:17.480]  That's one of his quotes in an interview, and then they make the movie Wally, and we're
[38:17.480 --> 38:21.760]  all these fat creatures living on galactic cruise ships, they're like, that's not happening.
[38:21.760 --> 38:22.760]  You're dead.
[38:22.760 --> 38:23.760]  Well, guess what?
[38:23.760 --> 38:32.080]  I look at Eric Schmidt and Sundar Pachai and Bill Gates and Fauci, and I say, you know
[38:32.080 --> 38:33.080]  what?
[38:33.080 --> 38:36.560]  You're saying I'm not essential, you're saying I need to die?
[38:36.560 --> 38:41.400]  How about you walk the plank first?
[38:41.400 --> 38:45.240]  And of course, these are lying criminals that get up there and get in our face, because
[38:45.240 --> 38:49.640]  they're part of the selfish eugenics class, and they're the worst people on earth.
[38:49.640 --> 38:53.120]  They're the ones that need to go first.
[38:53.120 --> 38:56.800]  Put your money where your mouth is.
[38:56.800 --> 39:00.720]  You designed the whole world to make us Wally creatures, where everything's delivered to
[39:00.720 --> 39:05.160]  us and where we can lay down if we've got enough money, everybody else is made obsolete
[39:05.160 --> 39:09.600]  and is fighting for their lives, then there's a collapse of civilization, a giant human
[39:09.600 --> 39:15.360]  civil war directed by AI as they destroy our infrastructure and make it where who's left
[39:15.360 --> 39:20.240]  has to sign on with the globalist to wipe out everybody just to save themselves.
[39:20.240 --> 39:24.440]  I've got the psychology figured out, and then I read their books and they say that.
[39:24.440 --> 39:29.360]  They're going to put us into a position, those of us that are productive and are successful,
[39:29.360 --> 39:32.960]  of having to serve the new world order and help wipe all of you out.
[39:32.960 --> 39:36.720]  Now, I've told you I'm not going to be part of that, and I could have already joined them.
[39:36.720 --> 39:43.160]  They tried to give me to join the Kissinger group on record, but you are being killed,
[39:43.160 --> 39:47.520]  and I've signed on to not be with these people because they're so creepy and they're obviously
[39:47.520 --> 39:51.880]  the losers, but those of you out there joking about this show that think it's entertainment,
[39:51.880 --> 39:55.600]  you're fools, and you better go read what the leader's saying, because what they said
[39:55.600 --> 40:00.480]  they do 40 years ago is in place, and what they said they do 20 years ago is almost in
[40:00.480 --> 40:04.280]  place, and they're accelerating their program.
[40:04.280 --> 40:08.080]  President Trump tweeted this out, he said he actually agrees with us too much, income
[40:08.080 --> 40:13.400]  disparity, changes must be made soon, Trump is trying to fix the income disparity.
[40:13.400 --> 40:19.760]  Under liberal globalism, again, we've gone to the income disparity being hundreds and
[40:19.760 --> 40:24.600]  hundreds and hundreds of times worse than it was, it's thousands of times, it's insane.
[40:24.600 --> 40:33.960]  We did the math one time, it's like.000000, 0000024 have 70% of the wealth through fraud.
[40:33.960 --> 40:41.560]  It's not 1% skype, 80%, it's amazing, and they don't want you to even have an economy,
[40:41.560 --> 40:46.360]  and they say they want to post human economy, while they find oh we love the brown people,
[40:46.360 --> 40:51.120]  oh white people are bad, all their dealings getting rid of the west and high incomes and
[40:51.120 --> 40:55.600]  the middle class so that the third world doesn't aspire to that, they've got to dynamite the
[40:55.600 --> 41:00.800]  first world so that the third world doesn't aspire to it, while the globalists build armored
[41:00.800 --> 41:05.320]  breakaway city-state fortresses that they live in that they're going to direct their
[41:05.320 --> 41:10.400]  robot exterminations of us from, and I'm not going to sit here and be part of it, I declare
[41:10.400 --> 41:17.920]  war on them, they will pay, and humanity is coming through, and we one day, black, brown,
[41:17.920 --> 41:21.800]  white of every color with red blood, we'll sit around that table together after we've
[41:21.800 --> 41:26.360]  defeated the globalists, and after we've repented for our evil, and we will move forward with
[41:26.360 --> 41:32.440]  incredible technology, and life extension, and strength, and systems built and designed
[41:32.440 --> 41:38.160]  to make us competitive, but altruistic, and chivalrous, and open, and strong, and we will
[41:38.160 --> 41:46.240]  all rise together, but the idea that oh somebody can't rise more at a sport, or in music, or
[41:46.240 --> 41:49.920]  something, that that hurts you, and you've got to be lowered to make them higher, that's
[41:49.920 --> 41:55.600]  the most satanic thought ever, they promise oh computers will make everything fair and
[41:55.600 --> 41:59.480]  choose what job you've got, and what you'll do, all of it is a lie, they're delivering
[41:59.480 --> 42:03.720]  you poverty, and death, and destruction, and we'll show you the numbers, that as you get
[42:03.720 --> 42:11.960]  poor, and as you lose your job, all of the liberal billionaires, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett,
[42:11.960 --> 42:19.200]  all of them have made more money in the last year than they made in the last 20, they are
[42:19.200 --> 42:26.200]  decimating everybody, they are wrecking everything, they are annihilating it, and they're keeping
[42:26.200 --> 42:33.480]  you from all the technologies that our mind invented, and that we developed, yeah these
[42:33.480 --> 42:37.880]  people are not noble humans that will be accepted by the gods in the plane of Elysium, they're
[42:37.880 --> 42:42.840]  the opposite, they've been chosen for another place, if we want Elysium we have to build
[42:42.840 --> 42:49.240]  it, and we have to support human development, and be honest about the world, and face the
[42:49.240 --> 42:54.080]  globalist eye to eye, and say we know who you are, we know you want us to die, we got
[42:54.080 --> 43:18.920]  a better idea, how about you die?
[43:18.920 --> 43:43.440]  This
[43:43.440 --> 43:48.640]  funds the info war and everything we're doing to save this Republic from the clutches of the
[43:48.640 --> 43:53.840]  globalist in the new world order. All of our bestselling items, 50% off, store it for shipping,

[44:52.720 --> 45:02.560]  today infowarstore.com. Whether you believe in evolution in the modern theory or not,
[45:02.560 --> 45:07.920]  the globalist controllers do and they constantly write about and talk about how they want to
[45:07.920 --> 45:14.640]  create a global crisis or a group of crises that force humans to quote evolve in a new
[45:14.640 --> 45:19.280]  better way. Now when you study how they actually want you to evolve, you believe in that it is to
[45:19.280 --> 45:24.480]  stop having children emerge with silicon bodies and a post human future. Talk about psychotic,
[45:24.480 --> 45:31.120]  talk about creepy, talk about crazy, but they need an event like COVID-19 to teach a mammal to
[45:31.120 --> 45:36.640]  wear some covering over its nose, over its breathing tubes to set the precedent for the forced
[45:36.640 --> 45:43.280]  inoculations for the GMO for the 5G and for all the things that they admit will end our humanity
[45:43.280 --> 45:48.560]  as we know it. That's why this is so evil. Their whole agenda for a cashless society,
[45:48.560 --> 45:54.320]  global government, UN control, getting us all into debt, getting rid of local government,
[45:54.320 --> 46:01.680]  think about all the facets of it, the censorship, the surveillance.
[46:24.320 --> 46:42.400]  Well brother, we put more in this than any other long-term high-quality energy powder there is.
[46:42.400 --> 46:46.080]  So this was designed on one of the top guys in the country, he didn't want his name on it because
[46:46.080 --> 46:49.200]  obviously the political issues, but we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for
[46:49.200 --> 46:54.160]  the design of it and we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there and
[46:54.160 --> 46:57.120]  you're saying that it's made your life better, so that means a lot to me. Thank you to all your
[46:57.120 --> 47:26.960]  truck drivers, we love you. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:27.360 --> 47:30.400]  This is the cutting edge of reality.
[47:33.520 --> 47:37.520]  The architects of this evil takeover, this hijacking of civilization,
[47:38.560 --> 47:44.480]  are so arrogant they publicly write books and white papers detailing every aspect of what we
[47:44.480 --> 47:51.520]  face and the good news is we talked about this decades before it manifested because it was behind
[47:51.520 --> 47:56.880]  the curtain and now that it's out in the open people are going wait a minute they're going
[47:56.880 --> 48:01.760]  back 10 years ago 20 years ago a year ago and going Jones said exactly what they're now saying on
[48:01.760 --> 48:07.200]  the news that people are matching up all over the internet word for word what I said five years
[48:07.200 --> 48:12.000]  ago 10 years ago with things being said today by top globalist politicians they're going how did
[48:12.000 --> 48:18.080]  Jones know this he's a prophet he's a clairvoyant well I do have the touch and all of us do but I
[48:18.800 --> 48:23.920]  am extremely psychic but that's that's not what does this it's it's it's knowing what to research
[48:23.920 --> 48:27.280]  and understanding of the globalist are and the richest people in the world are setting up a
[48:27.280 --> 48:30.960]  world government and building a world but they're going to tear out the infrastructure for humans
[48:30.960 --> 48:34.400]  and they're saying we're parasites we've got to be gotten rid of and they're going to merge with
[48:34.400 --> 48:38.800]  machines and now it's on the cover of the wall street journal the New York Times and NBC news
[48:38.800 --> 48:43.520]  what are we going to do and now they release the virus and they shut the economy down and
[48:43.520 --> 48:53.760]  they're coming with force inoculations I am not a victim I am not going to grovel to my enslavers
[48:55.760 --> 49:00.800]  the famous Native American I forget who said it the name maybe you guys can search this in his
[49:00.800 --> 49:09.840]  name will come up I remember the saying it's that leadership is submitting to duty
[49:09.840 --> 49:13.360]  not
[49:18.640 --> 49:25.280]  leadership is submission to duty not about the heights of power because once you get real power
[49:26.160 --> 49:30.160]  you find out there's a bunch of evil people want it and they're trying to get everybody
[49:30.160 --> 49:33.600]  to join them to carry out the evil operation and you're like I don't even want this power I'm
[49:33.600 --> 49:40.560]  going to be around you people there it is Gordon Tautusi leadership is about submission to duty
[49:40.560 --> 49:45.760]  not elevation to power there you go and that's exactly the truest thing you'll ever hear
[49:47.520 --> 49:52.880]  it's about submission to duty it's not about elevation to power let me tell you the people
[49:52.880 --> 49:58.800]  that have elevated themselves and it's all about them they're the most selfish evil creepy people
[49:58.800 --> 50:04.400]  you'd ever be around and that's the thing they can look at our fallen state and play like their
[50:04.400 --> 50:08.960]  gods the Bible tells us we're falling but the ones telling us we're falling into roll over and
[50:08.960 --> 50:17.440]  climb into our graves and dig our own graves are the very worst of us no no no I will be born again
[50:17.440 --> 50:21.680]  by Christ the Holy Spirit that's giving me the discernment I know it's real and I know that
[50:21.680 --> 50:27.680]  spirit makes me feel good and teaches me how to live and makes me strong way stronger than you
[50:27.680 --> 50:32.160]  so despite the fact you've stolen all the money and have control over everything you fear me
[50:32.160 --> 50:38.880]  because you know I have the spirit of Christ in me as many others do and you know I know who you
[50:38.880 --> 50:45.440]  are and you think by extinguishing our light you will somehow then be God you will never be God
[50:45.440 --> 50:49.520]  because you've not recognized real God and gotten on your knees
[50:49.520 --> 50:58.880]  your attempts destroy humanity are you digging your graves we're not digging our own graves
[50:58.880 --> 51:02.880]  you're digging your graves all right let's get into it
[51:05.280 --> 51:08.480]  if you don't know what Stockholm syndrome is every time I print this up I want to read it
[51:09.200 --> 51:15.360]  I'll never get around to it but let's just do this here's a few minutes of the business inside
[51:15.360 --> 51:20.720]  of reports on info wars.com Trump tweeted it out with 40 million Americans filed for unemployment
[51:20.720 --> 51:26.400]  during the coronavirus pandemic billionaires saw their net worth increased by half a trillion
[51:26.400 --> 51:31.600]  dollars and they're the ones financing race riots and crap because it's a sick joke rear guard
[51:31.600 --> 51:37.120]  action for them because once they get rid of your grassroots economy you'll be dependent on them
[51:37.120 --> 51:43.840]  and that's what they want domestication for extermination not domestication to have peace
[51:43.840 --> 51:48.320]  there was a oh we gotta have world government to stop disruptive technologies and plagues getting
[51:48.320 --> 51:53.680]  out so they release the plague and they even say they'll do that gate says oh this is just a drill
[51:53.680 --> 51:59.680]  terrorists are going to release the real one soon and he starts laughing gates if you think you're
[51:59.680 --> 52:03.680]  going to get away with releasing a bio weapon thing again of course Hitler just wanted to kill
[52:03.680 --> 52:09.360]  everybody too he he meant to lose by the way he hated the german people and at the end said that
[52:09.360 --> 52:15.120]  that's what Hitler actually said so see gates and intends to probably die tearing this out
[52:15.760 --> 52:19.120]  you say the gates hey you know people are going to stand up to you yeah i know not before i've
[52:19.120 --> 52:25.280]  killed all you though you see but he's to get you in order under his scientific dictatorship
[52:25.280 --> 52:31.680]  and the un so that you'll be in his paradigm so he can control you as he takes us down because he
[52:31.680 --> 52:37.680]  is a demonically controlled entity not a human he's an avatar jacked in from the worst stuff in
[52:37.680 --> 52:47.680]  the galaxy all right let's go ahead and roll the enemy consolidating our economy and wrecking us
[52:47.680 --> 52:52.160]  and as we go bankrupt and as we lose our houses and as our business is shut down their business
[52:52.160 --> 52:58.320]  is essential and their business stays open they are essential we're not they live we sleep
[52:58.320 --> 53:05.920]  here it is this is the unemployment rate during the covet 19 pandemic
[53:07.200 --> 53:12.000]  and this is amazon ceo jeff bezos's net worth during that same time span
[53:13.200 --> 53:19.440]  from march to june 2020 amazon founder jeff bezos saw his wealth rise by an estimated
[53:19.440 --> 53:25.040]  48 billion dollars the founder of the video conferencing platform zoom grew his nest egg
[53:25.040 --> 53:33.200]  by over 2.5 billion and former microsoft ceo steve balmers net worth increased by 15.7 billion
[53:33.200 --> 53:38.000]  these kinds of examples might lead you to think that when billionaires profit during a crisis
[53:38.000 --> 53:43.680]  it's just a matter of right place right time well that's not false but it's not entirely true either
[53:44.320 --> 53:50.800]  casino magnate sheldon adelson saw his wealth increase by 5 billion while elon musk saw an
[53:50.800 --> 53:57.600]  increase of 17.2 billion when you add up the numbers billionaires in the united states have
[53:57.600 --> 54:05.600]  increased their total net worth 637 billion during the covet 19 pandemic so far at the same time
[54:06.320 --> 54:11.280]  more than 40 million americans filed for unemployment with tens of millions of americans
[54:11.280 --> 54:17.120]  out of a paycheck and the stock market plummeting by 37 percent in march how is it that the rich
[54:17.120 --> 54:21.840]  have continued getting richer this isn't the first time billionaires have seen gains
[54:21.840 --> 54:27.120]  while a large portion of americans were feeling losses when the housing bubble burst in 2017
[54:27.120 --> 54:30.560]  so they walk through the fact that with trillions being thrown to the stock market by the federal
[54:30.560 --> 54:34.160]  reserve to prop it up they're the ones that actually become the beneficiaries and get it
[54:34.160 --> 54:40.480]  but that's only part of it their businesses are essential your businesses aren't particularly with
[54:41.520 --> 54:44.880]  bezos and apple and others not so much with musk i'm not defending musk
[54:44.880 --> 54:49.920]  he had some of his factories shut down in california but but again ladies and gentlemen
[54:51.760 --> 54:57.120]  your little restaurant is an essential but the big one is and it's about them telling you when
[54:57.120 --> 55:00.960]  you're essential and when you aren't it's incredibly dangerous all right i'm gonna start the next hour
[55:02.080 --> 55:05.520]  and i'm gonna get into the most important news yet that i haven't gotten into and that's
[55:05.520 --> 55:11.120]  the forced inoculation news the un they're now officially saying exactly how they're
[55:11.120 --> 55:15.360]  going to carry all the sound how and actually have set up university studies on how to brain
[55:15.360 --> 55:22.320]  watch the public to actually say how to how to manipulate us psychologically to go under all
[55:22.320 --> 55:28.480]  of this and it's it's just the absolute line of the sand and then they admit by the way the vaccine
[55:28.480 --> 55:32.160]  hurts a hundred percent of people that take it well i've never heard to be honest before
[55:33.120 --> 55:37.920]  20 percent have to be hospitalized dates have mentioned and they're going to have
[55:37.920 --> 55:42.560]  indemnity from being hurt and it doesn't even give you immunity for more than like a month
[55:42.560 --> 55:47.440]  so he says you got to get five shots a year if you're an adult two of your kid folks this is
[55:47.440 --> 55:54.000]  dna vaccine they they are jacking with your cells inside they're not teaching yourselves how to
[55:54.000 --> 55:59.280]  kick somebody's ass you know imagine if you could watch like a fight tape because you're a boxer
[55:59.280 --> 56:02.240]  and you can watch the guy you're about to fight watch his last 10 fights that's kind of like
[56:02.240 --> 56:09.120]  your immune system gets a preview to watching fight tapes or football you know clips of the
[56:09.120 --> 56:12.240]  team you're about to play i remember when i was playing football when that good in high school
[56:12.240 --> 56:16.320]  but they make us there and watch the watch the tapes so what the other team's gonna do and so
[56:16.320 --> 56:20.000]  that's that's what learned immunity is and it still causes problems because you're not really
[56:20.000 --> 56:24.240]  watching the tape you're actually out on the field when they inject that in you you can actually get
[56:24.240 --> 56:29.120]  hurt so it's like another game they tell you they're playing you a fight tape they tell you
[56:29.120 --> 56:34.000]  they're playing you a football game tape but really you're actually on the field so there's
[56:34.000 --> 56:40.400]  your analogy going from analogy to reality but now they go oh no we're gonna go in to your cell
[56:40.400 --> 56:49.920]  nuclei and we're going to make your cell produce a protein that blocks the receptor of this thing
[56:49.920 --> 56:52.800]  and but we don't know what else is going to do but and people are getting real sick
[56:52.800 --> 56:59.200]  some are dying and boy they're covering it up but imagine what the long-term effects are yeah
[56:59.200 --> 57:03.280]  though this is sterilization they've been caught doing secret experimentation to vaccines before
[57:03.280 --> 57:08.000]  and again if there's a certain point where they can't hide it anymore don't forget there's all
[57:08.000 --> 57:12.480]  these medical doctors all these scientists like the press conference they had this week that
[57:12.480 --> 57:16.880]  Bill Gates who went to doctor he had it banned Fauci agreed on national news that it should have
[57:16.880 --> 57:21.600]  been banned because doctors still were having great results with hydroxychloroquine which is what
[57:21.600 --> 57:26.080]  the studies show but Gates paid for a fake study to say it didn't work that study got removed but
[57:26.080 --> 57:31.120]  it doesn't matter the UN uses that study to say that you can't have doctors on TV on their own
[57:31.120 --> 57:37.200]  press conference on Breitbart or M4s well guess what all those banned interviews are at band.video
[57:37.200 --> 57:41.680]  band.video don't just go watch them yourself go get a big list of them and send them to friends
[57:41.680 --> 57:46.000]  and family and say here's the videos of the banned doctors you're not supposed to see decide for
[57:46.000 --> 57:54.640]  yourself hour two coming up. States cracking down on social gatherings says see it in because Fauci
[57:54.640 --> 58:01.840]  says if we don't we'll see further surges in coronavirus positives because they're only ramping
[58:01.840 --> 58:07.600]  up the testing and because the tests have been designed at the Wuhan lab it turns out to be
[58:07.600 --> 58:13.600]  completely fraudulent they cooked the whole thing up offshore in a communist dictatorship
[58:13.600 --> 58:20.720]  with Fauci Bill Gates and the Chai comms to be directed by the UN as a giant planetary power
[58:20.720 --> 58:26.320]  grab and now it's all over the news that indeed Bill Gates has developed digital tattoos under
[58:26.320 --> 58:32.640]  your skin and so is Google and they're deploying them at the airports next year where you'll have
[58:32.640 --> 58:37.040]  to have it to be able to travel oh and then soon to leave your house or go in a grocery store
[58:37.040 --> 58:41.200]  and the contact tracers work for Bill and Melinda Gates and the Clintons and they're
[58:41.200 --> 58:45.600]  going to come to your house and make sure you're inoculated yes we're now inside the mark of the
[58:45.600 --> 58:51.600]  beast resist to be enslaved a lot of you are probably already very familiar with these terms
[58:51.600 --> 58:57.280]  about to introduce but some folks are so for those that aren't here they are activated charcoal
[58:58.720 --> 59:08.240]  and then another term enamel safe activated charcoal is the fastest growing type of toothpaste
[59:08.240 --> 59:12.720]  for a good reason it really really works well we've come up with the best activated charcoal
[59:12.720 --> 59:17.360]  toothpaste with no fillers the cleanest type the highest quality with a bunch of high quality
[59:17.360 --> 59:22.640]  essential oils and other ingredients known and documented to do amazing things for your oral
[59:22.640 --> 59:27.600]  hygiene and your overall health in your mouth that's so critical and it makes your teeth look really
[59:27.600 --> 59:32.240]  white and really really clean and it's good for your gums but on top of that it doesn't have any
[59:32.240 --> 59:36.880]  ingredients that are known to hurt enamel i've gone out before and gotten toothpaste that really
[59:36.880 --> 59:43.360]  made my teeth clean but eroded an anvil up the top so i got into really safe healthy types of
[59:43.360 --> 59:47.840]  toothpaste and that's what this is it's available at infowarstore.com
[59:51.520 --> 59:54.160]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:00:00.400 --> 1:00:06.080]  next segment i'm going to get into the deadly bio weapon inside the vaccines they're developing
[1:00:06.080 --> 1:00:09.360]  they can't even hide the fact it's going to make you sick because it's going to kill you down the
[1:00:09.360 --> 1:00:14.720]  road this is live saving information coming up but here's a powerful report it needs to be seen
[1:00:14.720 --> 1:00:20.000]  here it is we don't got to kill the cleanse we'll make them kill themselves how's that
[1:00:20.560 --> 1:00:27.280]  rain of terror we learned six months ago how staffers within the bernie sanders campaign
[1:00:27.280 --> 1:00:33.920]  have been planning a violent rain of terror how they were planning an organized show of force
[1:00:33.920 --> 1:00:40.240]  and the destruction of property these people are motivated by by fear and if we mobilize and if we
[1:00:40.240 --> 1:00:46.080]  show we make a show of force and a show and so that like they're very strong and we're
[1:00:46.080 --> 1:00:51.200]  we've all got we've put in work and we're very powerful now i think you'll have a good many
[1:00:51.200 --> 1:00:55.040]  people who are going to back down often who are going to be so afraid that they're that they're
[1:00:55.040 --> 1:01:00.080]  going to back down off that position just like a militant labor movement that's willing to
[1:01:00.080 --> 1:01:10.000]  uh one strike uh and if necessary uh just you know just destroy property like that how they
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:17.680]  were planning to burn cities so it just really likely what cities burn how they were organized
[1:01:17.680 --> 1:01:22.560]  with antifa we don't want to scare people off so you kind of got to feel it out first before you
[1:01:23.120 --> 1:01:29.280]  get into the crazy stuff but um what kind of crazy stuff tell me you know we were talking about
[1:01:29.280 --> 1:01:34.880]  you know more more extreme organizations and stuff like antifa you know you're talking about the
[1:01:34.880 --> 1:01:41.680]  yellow vests and all that but you know we're kind of keeping that keeping that in the background
[1:01:41.680 --> 1:01:45.840]  if right now and that they were willing to murder what are we going to do with those people that
[1:01:45.840 --> 1:01:54.080]  resist the change because that's a big deal well i'll tell you what in cuba what do they do to
[1:01:54.080 --> 1:02:01.520]  reactionaries they shot him on the beach
[1:02:03.680 --> 1:02:05.520]  do you want to fight against the revolution
[1:02:07.680 --> 1:02:13.760]  their reign of terror has arrived in the black lives matter movement and their main target
[1:02:13.760 --> 1:02:21.280]  is every law abiding citizen in america after weeks of unprecedented mayhem we can clearly see
[1:02:21.280 --> 1:02:29.600]  their tactics they stop traffic unannounced on major freeways or thoroughfares placing a burden
[1:02:29.600 --> 1:02:34.960]  upon thousands of random men and women across the nation just going about their business
[1:02:35.920 --> 1:02:43.520]  if anyone protests asks for passage or expresses anything other than submissive silence they are
[1:02:43.520 --> 1:02:50.880]  attacked by the mob dragged out of their cars and beaten we have had several drivers shot at
[1:02:50.880 --> 1:02:56.000]  a 27 year old defense attorney shot a driver in the head during a protest
[1:03:00.640 --> 1:03:05.520]  these are random men and women who happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time
[1:03:06.400 --> 1:03:13.360]  and after being dragged from their cars beaten and shot at they are accused of somehow attacking
[1:03:13.360 --> 1:03:21.840]  the protest the media supports this lie mainstream outlets running outrageous headlines suggesting
[1:03:22.400 --> 1:03:29.280]  that any random person who gets attacked by the mob had it coming and that the angry mob
[1:03:29.280 --> 1:03:35.040]  is morally superior to all of us this is us just trying to create a world filled with love and

[1:03:52.480 --> 1:03:58.960]  individual carrying a rifle garret foster quickly approached the car and motioned with the rifle for
[1:03:58.960 --> 1:04:05.520]  perry to lower his window he complied thinking that foster was the police but when foster began
[1:04:05.520 --> 1:04:13.920]  to raise his rifle towards him perry shot and fired garret foster died that night of gunshot
[1:04:13.920 --> 1:04:21.600]  wounds daniel perry is a free man because this was self-defense also in austin texas the city

[1:07:16.320 --> 1:07:20.080]  segment i'll show some of that footage they're still bleeping some of it there's so much cussing
[1:07:20.080 --> 1:07:27.840]  by antifun blm but let me right now get into this i understand if you're a new listener and you've
[1:07:27.840 --> 1:07:31.120]  heard about info wars you've heard his demon eyes but you've decided to tune in and hear what all
[1:07:31.120 --> 1:07:39.360]  the hubbub's about that a lot of this stuff doesn't sound real i understand i was the same way 30
[1:07:39.360 --> 1:07:48.800]  years ago 35 years ago when my dad said hey you ought to read the big the brzezinski's book
[1:07:48.800 --> 1:07:56.960]  the technotronic era when i was about 12 and i was reading some world war two adult history
[1:07:57.840 --> 1:08:02.960]  he said why don't you read this and you know i didn't read that brzezinski book for three or
[1:08:02.960 --> 1:08:07.280]  four years and then when i read it i didn't understand a lot of it and later i read more of
[1:08:07.280 --> 1:08:13.200]  his books but he said we're set up a world government we the elites control organized crime
[1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:22.240]  because we want to be in control of it we run the pedophile networks remember asking my dad
[1:08:22.240 --> 1:08:26.560]  about that when i was like 1670 he goes yeah they use it for blackmail and control i mean
[1:08:26.560 --> 1:08:31.680]  none of this is new ladies and gentlemen it's just gotten a lot worse or maybe we just know more about
[1:08:31.680 --> 1:08:42.560]  it but now they're out in the open with the ceo of microsoft writing the opening for claus schwaab
[1:08:42.560 --> 1:08:50.640]  that runs the debo script saying we're building a world with no humans with zero carbon and humans
[1:08:50.640 --> 1:08:56.000]  are bad and we're building an infrastructure to cut off the human economy because carbon's poisonous
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:09:01.040]  which it isn't part of the life cycle on earth but by doing that they've said it where they take
[1:09:01.040 --> 1:09:09.200]  control they tax it they literally can engage in siege and kill you and now they say we're cutting
[1:09:09.200 --> 1:09:16.400]  off the world economy we're keeping you in your homes and it's for covid of course it's not
[1:09:16.400 --> 1:09:20.960]  covid isn't killing millions people from starvation the lockdown is covid isn't causing
[1:09:20.960 --> 1:09:30.480]  the depression the lockdown is and they go but it is helping the earth lower the carbon footprint
[1:09:30.480 --> 1:09:34.720]  and that's a good thing and bill gates says he's going to lower human carbon to zero and the whole
[1:09:34.720 --> 1:09:41.440]  ted talk crowd laughs because they're in the club where you talk about killing almost everybody
[1:09:41.440 --> 1:09:47.280]  except you the enlightened elites oh but we're not going to kill people based on race it'll be
[1:09:47.280 --> 1:09:53.680]  based on your decisions and how you behave and if you're a good globalist of a social score
[1:09:53.680 --> 1:10:01.120]  and Schwab said that two years ago in his book that they will decide at the global level what good
[1:10:01.120 --> 1:10:06.800]  behavior is and then you will be valued on whether you live or die according to that score
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:13.600]  and now let's see it oh we got to kill granny because we can hire 10 teachers they're getting
[1:10:13.600 --> 1:10:21.200]  rid of teachers and bringing in online you're all obsolete and when you decide that some other group
[1:10:21.200 --> 1:10:25.680]  because they're poorer than you or because they've got different color skin than you or
[1:10:25.680 --> 1:10:31.040]  because they're young or because their brain damage or because they're old that they don't have value
[1:10:31.040 --> 1:10:36.320]  and that you're going to get ahead because you cut them off and starve them to death you've just
[1:10:36.320 --> 1:10:43.840]  been tricked into a zero sum game the pie stays one side they control the pie and they to notice
[1:10:43.840 --> 1:10:48.640]  on one hand they say don't be competitive get rid of the family get rid of men being men women being
[1:10:48.640 --> 1:10:53.840]  women things that make us strong and territorial and not giving up our territory but out of the
[1:10:53.840 --> 1:10:57.760]  other side they say oh but we got to lower everybody's standard of living to make the poor
[1:10:57.760 --> 1:11:02.560]  happier but that's actually going to lower their standard while they're these ultra billionaire
[1:11:02.560 --> 1:11:07.840]  trillionaire people above the law who say they want to kill everybody but they think you're so dumb
[1:11:07.840 --> 1:11:12.560]  you don't go read their white papers but now they think you're so dumb they put it in the
[1:11:12.560 --> 1:11:16.960]  wall street journal in the new york times and mbc news that the post-human world's here and it's
[1:11:16.960 --> 1:11:22.480]  going to be so beautiful looking forward to the end of humanity covid showed us we're just bad and
[1:11:22.480 --> 1:11:27.360]  broken we're pathetic and we've got to throw the towel in and give it up sounds like some flying
[1:11:27.360 --> 1:11:33.200]  saucer landing goes you are pathetic and weak those of you that serve me may live a few years
[1:11:33.200 --> 1:11:40.560]  everyone else will die now take this shot to be healthy you're like to the alien ambassador you go
[1:11:40.560 --> 1:11:49.760]  you just said you want to kill me but now you got a shot that saves me that's not an alien
[1:11:49.760 --> 1:11:55.520]  ambassador that didn't happen bill gates is saying i want to kill you i want to abort you i want to
[1:11:55.520 --> 1:12:00.400]  euthanize you i want i want you're a useful see there you're a piece of crap you're a piece of
[1:12:00.400 --> 1:12:10.320]  garbage you're a piece of slime over and over and over and over and over and over and over again but
[1:12:10.320 --> 1:12:17.680]  then oh he's got a shot for you to keep you safe which is going to make you sick yeah it's like in
[1:12:17.680 --> 1:12:21.040]  mars attacks with a runner on killing everybody but they're saying don't run we are your friends
[1:12:21.760 --> 1:12:26.080]  you say well that's dumb why have real military has actually done that before saying don't run
[1:12:26.080 --> 1:12:32.400]  we are your friends because it makes enough people hesitate long enough in a combat situation if they
[1:12:32.400 --> 1:12:37.840]  hear a tank saying in your own language hey we're here to help you the war is over you know people
[1:12:37.840 --> 1:12:44.400]  will hesitate and they'll get killed never seen um saving private ryan which is a fictitious story
[1:12:44.400 --> 1:12:48.560]  but it's based on real events it's kind of historical fiction they call it but there's the
[1:12:50.080 --> 1:12:53.680]  german soldier and the american soldier fighting in this house house house combat they're fighting
[1:12:53.680 --> 1:12:57.840]  with their bayonets they're trying to stab each other and the german says oh wait i give up i'm
[1:12:57.840 --> 1:13:02.640]  your friend and the american gi who has the initiative hesitates for just a minute
[1:13:05.120 --> 1:13:09.120]  and the german rolls over on him and drives that knife right in his chest and that's all
[1:13:09.120 --> 1:13:14.960]  that is just don't run we are your friends you're like you know they're the enemy you know they're
[1:13:14.960 --> 1:13:21.200]  coming to kill you they've said they're doing it and you know why bill gates says i want to reduce
[1:13:21.200 --> 1:13:29.840]  populations you know why he does all that because he has to get all his adherents and all of his
[1:13:29.840 --> 1:13:35.440]  minions to think he's powerful if he can be up there in a ted talk saying we're gonna kill grandma
[1:13:35.440 --> 1:13:41.040]  we're gonna kill you we're gonna get rid of humans i love planned parenthood there's too many people
[1:13:42.480 --> 1:13:46.640]  now it's time for the great reset to cut off the economy and start to stop the carbon footprint
[1:13:46.640 --> 1:13:51.120]  that's all this is it's bigger than trump they're strangling the western economy they always
[1:13:51.120 --> 1:13:55.600]  had a plan to strangle it they always had a plan to shut it down and when we implode the third world
[1:13:55.600 --> 1:14:00.320]  dies depopulation hundred plus million people set starved up the next year you and already says
[1:14:00.320 --> 1:14:04.640]  millions have already died but they don't humanize you would show you each child starving to death
[1:14:04.640 --> 1:14:11.200]  in latin america and in africa and many other areas no they show you the one black guy being killed
[1:14:11.200 --> 1:14:16.320]  by a cop who didn't even know what he was doing he was trained by his department to do that i'm not
[1:14:16.320 --> 1:14:21.200]  defending it but that one guy comes for the reason to burn down america in your own future
[1:14:21.200 --> 1:14:26.560]  because the media owned by billionaires that hate you said so because they want to stop trump one
[1:14:26.560 --> 1:14:30.480]  of the only billionaires that wants a service economy and believes in people because that's
[1:14:30.480 --> 1:14:36.560]  what he owns is golf courses and hotels and casinos and his whole world is geared towards hospitality
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  he likes who he is he likes his hot wife he he's projecting onto you that you're powerful and that
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:48.160]  you're amazing and that you're beautiful and that you're going to do incredible things and he tells
[1:14:48.160 --> 1:14:54.160]  you that the whole left says you suck you're racist america's bad we can't wait to get rid of the
[1:14:54.160 --> 1:15:00.400]  humans blah blah blah so we all feel crappy about ourselves and crawl into a grave they've dug for us
[1:15:01.920 --> 1:15:07.040]  but that's not our destiny and so trump's got his issues we all do but at the end of the day
[1:15:07.040 --> 1:15:14.080]  he loves empowering the average person he loves success and he's into positive thinking and he
[1:15:14.080 --> 1:15:19.600]  wants a pro-human future and he doesn't jive with all these hunchback pedophile new order people
[1:15:19.600 --> 1:15:25.360]  that are going down you know i'm gonna hit the vaccine news at the bottom of the hour and i'm

[1:19:56.320 --> 1:20:02.080]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:20:08.560 --> 1:20:19.120]  i got off the river boat in new orleans in the spring of 82 i walked into a gambling house
[1:20:19.120 --> 1:20:29.920]  as gamblers often do i had myself a drink and i joined in a polka game the dealer was a woman
[1:20:30.960 --> 1:20:32.480]  so i asked her for her name
[1:20:35.360 --> 1:20:39.440]  she smiled at me so pretty we are back live i'm your host alex jones let's get into some of the
[1:20:39.440 --> 1:20:46.160]  good news that's unfolding the globalist social engineers want a global government an anti-human
[1:20:46.160 --> 1:20:51.280]  future in their own world it's a total mega-melanical power trip they want to control technology and
[1:20:51.280 --> 1:20:56.880]  build a system where the general public is obsolete bare minimum that stated public imagine if hitler
[1:20:56.880 --> 1:21:02.880]  was saying in 1937 when i get control of germany fully i'm going to get control of europe and i'm
[1:21:02.880 --> 1:21:07.120]  going to set up a european union then i'm going to take over the world and have 10 regions three
[1:21:07.120 --> 1:21:12.000]  super regions i'm going to put edward the eight king of england over the e you and then we're
[1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:16.560]  going to go in and economically take control of these countries and then we're going to taint vaccines
[1:21:16.560 --> 1:21:21.840]  and other drugs and food until it slowly poisons all of these non-white people and then we're going
[1:21:21.840 --> 1:21:30.080]  to exterminate them well people would have really been against hitler here's the deal hitler got all
[1:21:30.080 --> 1:21:34.240]  that from margaret sanger and the rockefeller foundation and cold springs harbour new york on
[1:21:34.240 --> 1:21:43.520]  record so historical fact just unbelievable volumes have been written of documents about it hitler
[1:21:43.520 --> 1:21:49.200]  was just a spin-off that this very group put out who they then built up and told he was going to be
[1:21:49.200 --> 1:21:54.480]  able to take over so it was a dialectic of his race-based extermination versus the globalist
[1:21:54.480 --> 1:22:00.960]  that wants to exterminate all the poor people and they created that dialectic in the oberton
[1:22:00.960 --> 1:22:07.760]  window so hitler looks extreme over here so they don't look extreme and that's the oberton window
[1:22:08.320 --> 1:22:11.520]  you don't know what the oberton window is you need to research it
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:20.800]  so instead of us going off communist systems that are class-based oh the rich are bad
[1:22:20.800 --> 1:22:26.560]  they're evil always let's get rid of them well that's the ultra rich always financing that to
[1:22:26.560 --> 1:22:30.320]  get rid of middle class and other rich people they don't control because they don't want
[1:22:30.320 --> 1:22:34.000]  innovation they don't want competition they want monopolies they want consolidation that's what
[1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:40.400]  john d rockefeller the first said was competition is a sin it's actually on an old film before he
[1:22:40.400 --> 1:22:46.800]  died like 1901 or something going competition is whenever the recording system came out he said
[1:22:46.800 --> 1:22:54.320]  competition is a sin he's like handing dimes out to people so they want monopolies
[1:22:54.320 --> 1:23:00.720]  and the ultimate monopoly is that humans have to be born in laboratories the ultimate
[1:23:01.920 --> 1:23:05.440]  monopoly is seeds don't produce seeds that grow plants anymore you got a bomb from
[1:23:05.440 --> 1:23:08.720]  monsanto every year which they've had for 30 years that's their plan
[1:23:10.960 --> 1:23:13.440]  and we don't figure into it like the great george carlin said
[1:23:18.240 --> 1:23:22.000]  and let's do play the mars attacks intro next segment guys police let's not forget thanks
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:30.000]  and what they base their whole takeover plan on is memory memory is the greatest form of
[1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:37.600]  intelligence and it's it's the the great part about memory is that you can train it to be better
[1:23:38.160 --> 1:23:42.560]  and the crew is awesome and so much is happening and so much is going on i do it all the time
[1:23:42.560 --> 1:23:46.880]  the way phones train us and tv's train us and the culture trains us there's lots of constant
[1:23:46.880 --> 1:23:51.040]  information coming at us so we forget the last thing we were going to do i do it more often the
[1:23:51.040 --> 1:23:57.680]  crew does and if you look at what the globalists say they brag and they go everything we have hinges
[1:23:57.680 --> 1:24:03.040]  on the fact that they don't have a memory of how we lie to them and how we cheat them and how we've
[1:24:03.040 --> 1:24:09.600]  consolidated power over and so we think moving minute to minute only addressing things as they
[1:24:09.600 --> 1:24:16.480]  come at us is somehow being oblivious is powerful it's not because the globalists have a long-term
[1:24:16.480 --> 1:24:21.840]  strategic goal they remember everything they go back and look over it they study it to have
[1:24:21.840 --> 1:24:30.240]  that angle over everyone that's why the attention span in 1970 was 30 something minutes it's less
[1:24:30.240 --> 1:24:38.880]  than 10 seconds today that's why bill gates and steve jobs will not let their children have phones
[1:24:38.880 --> 1:24:46.080]  or ipads when they first came out and you look at that child they want that thing because it's pro
[1:24:46.080 --> 1:24:50.320]  gramming them and it's fundamentally taking them away from you forever so you want to sit there
[1:24:50.320 --> 1:24:55.760]  and talk to your husband at dinner hey it's real easy to do it but let me tell you your child never
[1:24:55.760 --> 1:24:59.680]  look at you in the eyes the same way and the deeper you let them go into this i'm gonna say the biggest
[1:24:59.680 --> 1:25:05.600]  future businesses will be rehabilitation centers to hook people up to brain scans and show them what
[1:25:05.600 --> 1:25:10.960]  computers have done and to help people get out of this because you think heroin's a drug you think
[1:25:10.960 --> 1:25:15.520]  alcohol's a drug it's nothing like the flicker rate and the way that they've designed the computers
[1:25:15.520 --> 1:25:20.720]  and the screens to trick your mind and manipulate your dopamine and all the big tech ads admit we
[1:25:20.720 --> 1:25:26.560]  make it as addictive and destructive to play on your weaknesses and control you and make you alone
[1:25:29.440 --> 1:25:33.760]  all of you are alone and now you're locked in your house and now you got to wear a mask and now
[1:25:33.760 --> 1:25:37.920]  you got to fear other humans but you don't fear that little computer in your hand that's your only
[1:25:37.920 --> 1:25:43.200]  gateway your only window into the world and in that little distorted window the overton window
[1:25:43.200 --> 1:25:49.520]  they can show you all this extremism of pedophiles convicted in schools bouncing kid on their knees
[1:25:49.520 --> 1:25:54.560]  and and and police stations being blown up and that those are the good guys and and all of this
[1:25:54.560 --> 1:26:01.360]  evil and satanism it's good and your child sees it through this little blinders this little window
[1:26:01.360 --> 1:26:07.040]  of a controlled reality that the ai globalist psychiatrist psychologists are hammering your
[1:26:07.040 --> 1:26:15.120]  children through it but let's go over the good news document cam shot please billionaire sex

[1:35:09.680 --> 1:35:16.000]  the cnn news center being stormed by protesters exposing the fact that they had bill gates on
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:19.680]  and and and and and and Anderson Cooper's like you're not connected epstein that's insane in gates
[1:35:19.680 --> 1:35:25.680]  Gates is like, I know, you're just in the WikiLeaks, you're just in a seven-story torture
[1:35:25.680 --> 1:35:30.800]  dungeon and you've been implicated and all the rest of it, you know nothing about Epstein.
[1:35:30.800 --> 1:35:36.320]  You can type in the headlines, Gates denies knowing Epstein, denies staying in his house.
[1:35:36.320 --> 1:35:40.760]  Turns out he practically lives there when he's in New York.
[1:35:40.760 --> 1:35:43.840]  It's disgusting.
[1:35:43.840 --> 1:35:47.000]  And so Cooper's up there attacking everybody, which is beautiful.
[1:35:47.000 --> 1:35:54.560]  He's so disconnected from reality, he thinks he can lecture everyone and tell them there's
[1:35:54.560 --> 1:35:58.440]  no pedophilia, there's no blackmail rings, there's no deep state, and that people don't
[1:35:58.440 --> 1:36:01.320]  go, oh my God, there is, you're such a liar.
[1:36:01.320 --> 1:36:02.320]  So here's what happened in Hollywood.
[1:36:02.320 --> 1:36:31.440]  By the way, I've changed my mind about QAnon and that's kind of like, change your mind
[1:36:31.440 --> 1:36:36.040]  about a restaurant because the food gets better.
[1:36:36.040 --> 1:36:40.640]  I've been set up, I've been given this info before so I get paranoid and I know how these
[1:36:40.640 --> 1:36:45.720]  honey traps work with this info, but I knew who set up Q, I knew it actually was out of
[1:36:45.720 --> 1:36:50.320]  the White House, not Trump, but one of the people, and I knew who was pushing it and
[1:36:50.320 --> 1:36:54.000]  then they got out of control and some other groups were able to manipulate folks who put
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:58.800]  out this info and so the people involved in original Q asked me to, you know, come out
[1:36:58.800 --> 1:37:08.480]  against it and, but then I saw it becomes just a big grassroots thing about real activism
[1:37:08.480 --> 1:37:12.360]  and became positive, the global society was bad, you know, it's about a month ago I go,
[1:37:12.360 --> 1:37:15.800]  two months ago I said, you know, I like Q now overall, it's got some pitfalls because
[1:37:15.800 --> 1:37:19.800]  anybody composes it, but just be careful, overall a lot of good people are involved,
[1:37:19.800 --> 1:37:24.680]  it's taken off, it's the way to anonymously do things, and so as long as you're careful
[1:37:24.680 --> 1:37:29.240]  I think it's good, and I said I predict against banned, which it's getting banned now, so
[1:37:29.240 --> 1:37:38.120]  I never judge the average Q person, why are you doing great work, it's just to just believe
[1:37:38.120 --> 1:37:44.600]  random stuff instead of all the big meat potatoes sometimes, it's like this, people say do you
[1:37:44.600 --> 1:37:48.960]  like anonymous, I've been asked that so many times by the press and citizens in the last
[1:37:48.960 --> 1:37:52.880]  15 years or so since the Guy Fawkes movie, beef and data came out, people started seeing
[1:37:52.880 --> 1:37:56.280]  that as a revolutionary symbol, not saying anybody can wear a mask, a lot of people in
[1:37:56.280 --> 1:38:01.400]  Guy Fawkes mask are great, some are bad, so I said anything anonymous you got to be careful
[1:38:01.400 --> 1:38:08.000]  about, that's all I'm saying, but overall it's gotten the public involved and it's
[1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:13.160]  gotten people out to be really angry and really engaged and you see black, white, Hispanic
[1:38:13.160 --> 1:38:19.680]  and Asian together saying all God's children, free God's children, you've got the media
[1:38:19.680 --> 1:38:24.720]  attacking them saying it doesn't exist and it isn't happening, they didn't just have
[1:38:24.720 --> 1:38:28.000]  that front line piece against me this week, they had a bunch of other PBS pieces that
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:31.520]  were produced, I didn't have time to watch all of them, but I was sent seven or eight,
[1:38:31.520 --> 1:38:36.200]  I watched two of them the last few days and man, they're like, Jones is very evil, he
[1:38:36.200 --> 1:38:41.760]  claims there's kidnapping rings tied to the government for blackmail and the comments
[1:38:41.760 --> 1:38:46.120]  are all on YouTube, just like you're scum, you're covering up, I mean, but they just
[1:38:46.120 --> 1:38:53.440]  keep gaslighting and gaslighting and gaslighting and gaslighting and I think the main reason
[1:38:53.440 --> 1:38:56.700]  I started turning against Q early on was not just knowing that they've been taken away
[1:38:56.700 --> 1:39:02.840]  from people who started it and it just kind of got decentralized, but some bad actors
[1:39:02.840 --> 1:39:08.560]  were there, it was also that, you know, there were a few people that are mentally ill that
[1:39:08.560 --> 1:39:12.520]  I'd be sent videos from like, yeah, I used to be with Trump, I used to like him, but
[1:39:12.520 --> 1:39:19.880]  now I'm with, you know, Robert Muller and I'm now with, you know, you know, such, they're
[1:39:19.880 --> 1:39:25.400]  really the good guys, it's just like, it doesn't matter, when you get the general public to
[1:39:25.400 --> 1:39:30.240]  wake up, it's like a student driver, they're gonna wreck some cars, they're gonna have
[1:39:30.240 --> 1:39:33.440]  some problems, that's just part of the muddling through it.
[1:39:33.440 --> 1:39:39.480]  So I think Q's overall is positive, I'm just saying be very careful like Arlington Road,
[1:39:39.480 --> 1:39:43.680]  that may be so accurate how they lay out, how they set you up, if somebody tells you,
[1:39:43.680 --> 1:39:48.000]  hey, that ship's really full of slave children, go attack it with a train or go attack the
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:53.680]  Hoover Dam, that's globalist operatives posing as Q manipulating you and please don't go
[1:39:53.680 --> 1:39:59.240]  out on secret missions to attack the prime minister of Canada's house, like that poor
[1:39:59.240 --> 1:40:04.160]  guy did because that's how they run these operations.
[1:40:04.160 --> 1:40:12.240]  So something like Q that's esoteric is very, very easy to be manipulated by the dark side,
[1:40:12.240 --> 1:40:16.280]  but if it gets crowds out, protests and pedophilia on the new world order and global government
[1:40:16.280 --> 1:40:20.800]  and becomes overall a positive thing, I'm like, hey, it's becoming positive and people
[1:40:20.800 --> 1:40:23.960]  are taking back control of it that are good and now maybe folks in the White House are
[1:40:23.960 --> 1:40:28.520]  saying maybe Q can be useful, but I mean, I'm in the real conversations with like Roger
[1:40:28.520 --> 1:40:32.080]  Stone and people at the White House and stuff, and this isn't like I'm just up here telling
[1:40:32.080 --> 1:40:36.760]  you all this, they're attacking me in congressional hearings in Congress folks, they want me arrested.
[1:40:36.760 --> 1:40:41.400]  I mean, I'm straight shooting you here, all I'm saying is we should not have any end
[1:40:41.400 --> 1:40:45.720]  fighting in this movement of liberty and maybe I'm guilty of that, I just know the Q people
[1:40:45.720 --> 1:40:50.160]  started it with me and so that's why I took the bait, well, I'm not doing it, I love Q,
[1:40:50.160 --> 1:40:52.840]  the general idea of awakening and standing up for children, does that mean the whole
[1:40:52.840 --> 1:40:53.840]  thing's perfect?
[1:40:53.840 --> 1:40:56.520]  No, everything needs to be looked at carefully.
[1:40:56.520 --> 1:41:01.960]  Now folks, we have developed the last year plus what I believe is the very best activated
[1:41:01.960 --> 1:41:06.920]  charcoal toothpaste out there and you get cleaner, healthier teeth and gums and fund
[1:41:06.920 --> 1:41:09.480]  the Info War, that is a true 360 win.
[1:41:09.480 --> 1:41:12.960]  You know, my dad's a dentist, he's not even really retired, I always say retired, he doesn't
[1:41:12.960 --> 1:41:17.960]  practice anymore, but I came to him and I said, I love activated charcoal toothpaste,
[1:41:17.960 --> 1:41:22.040]  people are asking for it, can you develop one with a top developer, one of the top labs
[1:41:22.040 --> 1:41:26.200]  in the U.S. that doesn't have all the silicate and all the extra additives to it?
[1:41:26.200 --> 1:41:31.440]  He said absolutely, well, it came in a month ago, it's amazing, it's better the test samples
[1:41:31.440 --> 1:41:35.840]  I had, we also have the activated charcoal toothpaste that's got all these essential
[1:41:35.840 --> 1:41:41.840]  oils in it and if you want clean, fresh breath, the way it neutralizes the plaque, the way
[1:41:41.840 --> 1:41:45.800]  it neutralizes the bacteria and the bad breath, the way it cleans the teeth and here's the
[1:41:45.800 --> 1:41:54.720]  key in a enamel safe way, when you see enamel safe on toothpaste, that means it doesn't clean
[1:41:54.720 --> 1:42:00.480]  with a bunch of abrasive garbage that eats your enamel, it cleans with natural essential
[1:42:00.480 --> 1:42:10.240]  oils and with the activated charcoal in a way that does it in a non-destructive fashion.
[1:42:10.240 --> 1:42:18.000]  So get your Dr. Jones Naturals activated charcoal toothpaste at infowarstore.com or call toll

[1:44:03.680 --> 1:44:07.680]  because of the Clinton Foundation running the contact tracing and admittedly with Google
[1:44:07.680 --> 1:44:11.480]  and Apple tracking all Americans on their phones even if you opt out of it or get rid
[1:44:11.480 --> 1:44:16.440]  of the apps, people realize these criminal groups are surveilling you and selling your

[1:45:54.400 --> 1:45:55.400]  infowarstore.com.
[1:45:55.400 --> 1:46:00.800]  There are a lot of reasons to get an Alex Jones plastic mask at infowarstore.com.
[1:46:00.800 --> 1:46:05.480]  You can wear them out to political events, you can trigger live darts, but one of the
[1:46:05.480 --> 1:46:12.520]  biggest reasons is it's a great conversation starter at any costume party or at Halloween.
[1:46:12.520 --> 1:46:16.800]  But on top of that, they admit that wearing these masks does absolutely nothing to protect
[1:46:16.800 --> 1:46:18.720]  you from COVID-19 or anything else.
[1:46:18.720 --> 1:46:22.400]  It's total virtues signaling to show that you're prepared for the force inoculations
[1:46:22.400 --> 1:46:27.600]  and contact tracing of their openly announcing, it's an active submission, it's an active
[1:46:27.600 --> 1:46:30.560]  like putting a burqa on your head and bowing down.
[1:46:30.560 --> 1:46:34.400]  The big reason to wear these is then in the stores, when people ask you why you're wearing
[1:46:34.400 --> 1:46:40.320]  a Halloween mask, say it's just as useless as the stupid cloth mask that you're wearing.
[1:46:40.320 --> 1:46:44.080]  And the M95 mask only control what's coming in, not what's going out.
[1:46:44.080 --> 1:46:47.640]  So they quote spread COVID-19, they don't protect from it.
[1:46:47.640 --> 1:46:50.600]  So again, it's a great way to throw it back in these control free spaces.
[1:46:50.600 --> 1:47:00.160]  You buy one for 9.95, you get four more free, they're at cost infowarstore.com.
[1:47:00.160 --> 1:47:15.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:15.720 --> 1:47:26.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind.
[1:47:26.560 --> 1:47:32.600]  You know, if I sound really positive, it's because I saw a lot of good things happen
[1:47:32.600 --> 1:47:36.000]  this weekend that I won't have time to get into today, we'll probably cover it tomorrow.
[1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:41.520]  But the police finally ended their stand down in Austin, Texas, just like they've ended
[1:47:41.520 --> 1:47:46.320]  it in Seattle and Portland, police partially, they had gun trucks, we have the videos, they're
[1:47:46.320 --> 1:47:51.240]  on infowarstore.com, driving around with guys in the back with guns, and the police started
[1:47:51.240 --> 1:47:56.680]  telling them on loudspeakers, they were following them, they said, with the anti-fab scum, they're
[1:47:56.680 --> 1:47:59.800]  not protesters, they're terrorists taking control of the roads.
[1:47:59.800 --> 1:48:02.480]  The cops acted like that for no reason, I'd say they're terrorists.
[1:48:02.480 --> 1:48:05.560]  The cops were telling them, hey, you lift that gun up again, you're going to be arrested,
[1:48:05.560 --> 1:48:13.840]  you plundered us, we're going to respond, and guess what, little commie dumbasses basically
[1:48:13.840 --> 1:48:16.200]  threw a fit after a while and left.
[1:48:16.200 --> 1:48:22.000]  Because let me tell you, this was a beta cock parade, ladies and gentlemen, from the guy
[1:48:22.000 --> 1:48:26.200]  that got killed last weekend, he's like, these people are all pussies, I'm going to go out
[1:48:26.200 --> 1:48:29.760]  and intimidate them, he'd been out all week, the police were told to stand down, coming
[1:48:29.760 --> 1:48:33.920]  up to people, we're doing a four year deal to get it, aiming guns at them in front of
[1:48:33.920 --> 1:48:39.400]  them, city council, look, I'm not looking for trouble, you walk up to me and aim a gun
[1:48:39.400 --> 1:48:42.720]  at me, I'm going to reach my glove compartment, you're going to get a bullet right between
[1:48:42.720 --> 1:48:48.920]  your chest, well that's what he got, I mean, do you know how many dangerous people there
[1:48:48.920 --> 1:48:54.800]  are that have owned businesses, or owned liquor stores, or been bouncers, or been in the military,
[1:48:54.800 --> 1:49:00.200]  or former police, they're not even PTSD, it's like a PTSD, you see somebody, they look like
[1:49:00.200 --> 1:49:02.800]  they're in camel uniform, he thought it was a cop, he rolls the window down, everybody's
[1:49:02.800 --> 1:49:07.760]  beating his car, and the guy raises a gun, and the guy shoots him, I mean, that's how
[1:49:07.760 --> 1:49:13.000]  real people operate, and you're dead, the guy that killed you, the army sergeant wasn't
[1:49:13.000 --> 1:49:19.400]  larping son, he took you for real, like he is, like, if he starts aiming a gun at you,
[1:49:19.400 --> 1:49:26.280]  you're probably about to die, well you ain't wanted him, so you died, I take no pleasure
[1:49:26.280 --> 1:49:35.360]  in that, but it does show all you methods, all you drug addict devil whispers that you
[1:49:35.360 --> 1:49:40.360]  want to go out and you think dominate us because you think we're weak and we're scared, no,
[1:49:40.360 --> 1:49:47.000]  you've taken our restraint for weakness because we don't want to become anything like you,
[1:49:47.000 --> 1:49:54.840]  because when people like me or many others start killing, we really start killing people.
[1:49:54.840 --> 1:49:59.000]  And so, you seem to know son, that we're not coming after you, we're coming after your
[1:49:59.000 --> 1:50:06.840]  bosses, and that's why the globalists who've taken our kindness for weakness, our restraint
[1:50:06.840 --> 1:50:11.040]  for weakness, you know, and I can see they're scared now, Bill Gates is scared, Fauci scared,
[1:50:11.040 --> 1:50:14.120]  Democrats are scared, you better be scared, your house of cards is coming out, because
[1:50:14.120 --> 1:50:18.360]  here's the thing, we're willing to die, I'd rather fix this than either happen, but if
[1:50:18.360 --> 1:50:24.400]  you think threatening us with jail or death or little death squad scares us, first thing,
[1:50:24.400 --> 1:50:28.320]  one of your death squads makes a move on me or any of the leadership of the Liberty Movement,
[1:50:28.320 --> 1:50:33.120]  the first time you do that, I don't have to give orders on air, nobody does, it's open
[1:50:33.120 --> 1:50:40.160]  season on you, you've all been targeted, lazed, ready, watched, prepared, you're going to
[1:50:40.160 --> 1:50:45.120]  be delivered dirt naps so fast, it's going to make your head spin.
[1:50:45.120 --> 1:50:50.320]  But hey, here's the problem, I know, even when the Russians were closing in from the
[1:50:50.320 --> 1:50:55.640]  east and the Americans and the British from the west, Hitler still thought he could win,
[1:50:55.640 --> 1:50:59.400]  they don't give him that.
[1:50:59.400 --> 1:51:05.720]  And so you just haven't figured it out yet, all right, let me hit this other news, I said
[1:51:05.720 --> 1:51:09.440]  I'd cover this, but I just get so sick of the COVID, even though it's the total takeover,
[1:51:09.440 --> 1:51:13.520]  but the good news is all over the world, people are rebelling, they're saying no, they're
[1:51:13.520 --> 1:51:17.280]  going to church, they're going everywhere, and if the churches are wimps and bought
[1:51:17.280 --> 1:51:21.000]  off, they go to the beach or they go to the park, and the cops aren't going along with
[1:51:21.000 --> 1:51:25.480]  it either, they know what's happening, they want to intimidate the people to bow down,
[1:51:25.480 --> 1:51:29.440]  they want the cops to bow down, they want all of our institutions to bow down so they
[1:51:29.440 --> 1:51:32.800]  can become the institutions, and then you've really got a police state.
[1:51:32.800 --> 1:51:37.760]  I mean, if the globalists could control the police, as you think the Justice Department's
[1:51:37.760 --> 1:51:41.720]  been bad, they only had partial control of it, then it's a real war, and then I'll be
[1:51:41.720 --> 1:51:46.120]  telling you the police are your enemy, and by the way, the police know that, they want
[1:51:46.120 --> 1:51:50.400]  to make the police start a fight with us, so the good ones all know they got to make
[1:51:50.400 --> 1:51:55.720]  them jump, but the good news is the police see through it, and the way the globalists
[1:51:55.720 --> 1:52:00.520]  have radicalized the police by educating them about the new world order is beautiful.
[1:52:00.520 --> 1:52:04.600]  I mean, you could have done a better job taking police who already knew what was going on
[1:52:04.600 --> 1:52:07.640]  and really letting them know, we have nothing to lose here, we're going to lose the whole
[1:52:07.640 --> 1:52:12.520]  country, you're not going to lose your pension, you're going to lose your children, your life,
[1:52:12.520 --> 1:52:16.960]  and there's nothing like having nothing to lose.
[1:52:16.960 --> 1:52:22.600]  Like Janice Joplin said, freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose, you ain't
[1:52:22.600 --> 1:52:31.760]  got nothing if you ain't free, you ain't got nothing if you ain't free.
[1:52:31.760 --> 1:52:35.040]  All you globalists try to threaten us and intimidate us because you think we're like
[1:52:35.040 --> 1:52:39.600]  you are, you think when you threaten us and attack us and take things away from us, it
[1:52:39.600 --> 1:52:44.280]  makes us want to bow down and get scared of you, no, it just makes us figure out that
[1:52:44.280 --> 1:52:49.720]  when we take our shot, that it's for sure and that we get your ass, because we're not
[1:52:49.720 --> 1:52:54.040]  like your candy ass, methad devil worshipers, they can't find their ass with both hands.
[1:52:54.040 --> 1:52:58.520]  We know what we're doing, we're competent, and we know you're trying to replace us with
[1:52:58.520 --> 1:53:02.840]  your crazy ass new world order, and I'm telling you, it's going on the ass heap of history
[1:53:02.840 --> 1:53:03.840]  for sure.
[1:53:03.840 --> 1:53:08.640]  It is a full mongodot, isn't it?
[1:53:08.640 --> 1:53:17.480]  Look at this, federal government and Yale are holding clinical trials on how to best
[1:53:17.480 --> 1:53:22.080]  quote, persuade Americans to take the COVID-19 vaccine, and I should have started the show
[1:53:22.080 --> 1:53:25.200]  with this, but I'll do it tomorrow, it's the GatewayPunner.com article, it's also up on
[1:53:25.200 --> 1:53:26.400]  inforwars.com.
[1:53:26.400 --> 1:53:30.160]  The federal government and Yale are currently holding clinical trials on how to best to
[1:53:30.160 --> 1:53:37.080]  persuade Americans into taking the Fauci Gates COVID-19 vaccine.
[1:53:37.080 --> 1:53:42.560]  Out of the 15 ways to do it, they're finding guilt message, embarrassment message, anger
[1:53:42.560 --> 1:53:47.240]  message, and trust in science messages are the best.
[1:53:47.240 --> 1:53:51.400]  Trust in science, safe and effective, 100% gets sick, and it doesn't protect you, that's
[1:53:51.400 --> 1:53:54.160]  the reality.
[1:53:54.160 --> 1:53:58.600]  Guilt message, oh, other people are going to get sick if you don't take it.
[1:53:58.600 --> 1:54:02.000]  Embarrassment message, oh, you haven't had it, you don't have the app on your phone,
[1:54:02.000 --> 1:54:07.040]  you don't have it, you don't have it, you can't come in the Walmart, you can't order
[1:54:07.040 --> 1:54:11.880]  everything on Amazon, you don't have it, you've got to make sure our drivers are safe.
[1:54:11.880 --> 1:54:17.480]  Anger message, they're hurting kids, this kid died of it because you didn't take it.
[1:54:17.480 --> 1:54:23.760]  Trust in the science, you got all these trendy millennials that think they get ahead because
[1:54:23.760 --> 1:54:28.600]  they bow down, but let me tell you, the general public sees right through it.
[1:54:28.600 --> 1:54:35.440]  Meanwhile, red flags soar as big firemen will be exempt from COVID-19 vaccine liability
[1:54:35.440 --> 1:54:36.440]  study.
[1:54:36.440 --> 1:54:39.480]  You have to tell articleininfowars.com and get it out because they're admitting it's
[1:54:39.480 --> 1:54:44.360]  hurting people and killing people and making 100% sick, 20% of the hospital, and they've
[1:54:44.360 --> 1:54:48.200]  never had a vaccine that hurts people like this because it's not even a normal vaccine,
[1:54:48.200 --> 1:54:53.560]  it didn't your body learn how to beat something, it goes into your cells and reproach, they're
[1:54:53.560 --> 1:54:59.560]  like, yeah, people are getting really sick taking this.
[1:54:59.560 --> 1:55:07.160]  Meanwhile, the UN says it never is going to end, that COVID is the new way of life.
[1:55:07.160 --> 1:55:11.240]  It's going to be lengthy years and years because they're going to count every cause of death
[1:55:11.240 --> 1:55:15.720]  as it, it's a chimera, you can't even get rid of it, it mutates, who the hell knows,
[1:55:15.720 --> 1:55:18.520]  it's a cover for a bunch of stuff they're going to do to us.
[1:55:18.520 --> 1:55:19.520]  Remember who did it to you?
[1:55:19.520 --> 1:55:21.680]  Bill Gates said, too many people and now he's got a shot for you.
[1:55:21.680 --> 1:55:25.160]  Bill Gates says he wants to kill the majority of humans on earth, but he wants to save you
[1:55:25.160 --> 1:55:28.160]  with a shot.
[1:55:28.160 --> 1:55:31.920]  It's constant orders, mandatory face masks, some of the sheriffs refuse to enforce.
[1:55:31.920 --> 1:55:36.360]  The answer is saying no and confronting people when they try to guilt you that you're not
[1:55:36.360 --> 1:55:37.360]  being a hero.
[1:55:37.360 --> 1:55:41.280]  They're these little compliant sheep, leadership is about saying no.
[1:55:41.280 --> 1:55:45.040]  I love going to the grocery store and having arguments with people.
[1:55:45.040 --> 1:55:49.560]  I'm not combative, I'm not submitting it, I get stronger, I get stronger, I get stronger.
[1:55:49.560 --> 1:55:53.760]  I suddenly have energy, I have a, jump in my step, I'm getting the food, I'm going out
[1:55:53.760 --> 1:55:57.360]  the parking lot, I'm confronting people, I'm going home and cooking it, I'm, I'm busy,
[1:55:57.360 --> 1:55:58.360]  I'm alive.
[1:55:58.360 --> 1:55:59.360]  I'm not bowing down.
[1:55:59.360 --> 1:56:00.360]  I'm not run by them.
[1:56:00.360 --> 1:56:01.360]  They don't control me.
[1:56:01.360 --> 1:56:02.360]  I'm not their slaves.
[1:56:02.360 --> 1:56:03.360]  See how it works?
[1:56:03.360 --> 1:56:07.960]  Ohio Abandons is addressing corporate ban at Republic Outrage saying to the governor,
[1:56:07.960 --> 1:56:12.000]  all these doctors say it's good, Bill Gates said to the doctor, the studies say it's good.
[1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:13.000]  You shut up.
[1:56:13.000 --> 1:56:17.000]  You don't have a ban on this in Ohio, you murdering criminal.
[1:56:17.000 --> 1:56:21.160]  The whole house of cards is going down.
[1:56:21.160 --> 1:56:26.080]  Tucker Carlson did a whole hour on Fauci and how he's a fraud and a liar Friday night.
[1:56:26.080 --> 1:56:30.120]  He's posted on infowars.com, let me tell you, he's going right after the New World Order's
[1:56:30.120 --> 1:56:31.120]  president.
[1:56:31.120 --> 1:56:35.920]  Fauci's like Bill Gates' right-hand man and Tucker Carlson should be saluted for the courage
[1:56:35.920 --> 1:56:36.920]  he's got at that level.
[1:56:36.920 --> 1:56:37.920]  Do what he did.
[1:56:37.920 --> 1:56:38.920]  Here's what he had to say.
[1:56:38.920 --> 1:56:46.800]  Fauci is 79, but maybe if he had like 22-year-old kids who are trying to make their way in
[1:56:46.800 --> 1:56:53.560]  this world, in an economy that is headed down the tubes, thanks largely to his recommendations,
[1:56:53.560 --> 1:56:55.040]  he would feel differently.
[1:56:55.040 --> 1:56:59.840]  It's not merely an inconvenience when your economy collapses, it's the end of the American
[1:56:59.840 --> 1:57:00.840]  dream.
[1:57:00.840 --> 1:57:01.840]  That's not a small thing.
[1:57:01.840 --> 1:57:04.000]  Maybe it's worth it, maybe it's not.
[1:57:04.000 --> 1:57:10.040]  But if it is, then you probably shouldn't take a pass on the question, are protests
[1:57:10.040 --> 1:57:14.400]  and riots okay, unless you're a total fraud, like a complete fraud?
[1:57:14.400 --> 1:57:15.400]  That's what he says.
[1:57:15.400 --> 1:57:19.200]  You shouldn't, you know, protest or good, but you can't open your church or your business
[1:57:19.200 --> 1:57:20.200]  unless you're Walmart.
[1:57:20.200 --> 1:57:24.520]  It's all a takeover, they all rigged it and everybody's finding out about how they ran
[1:57:24.520 --> 1:57:27.520]  the Wuhan lab and how Bill Gates and him did it and how they get all this money and
[1:57:27.520 --> 1:57:32.400]  how both Gates and him own the vaccine companies, they own the patents on them.
[1:57:32.400 --> 1:57:37.920]  Oh yeah, I agree with Bill Bigtree, you're both the enemy, everybody hates you and you're
[1:57:37.920 --> 1:57:54.960]  going to prison, Fauci, you little demonic maggot, you criminal piece of trash.
