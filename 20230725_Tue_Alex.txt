[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.000]  LeBron James' son had a massive heart attack on the basketball court today after taking a cover shot. We're covering it live, coming up. It's incredible, stay with us, somebody you know, tune in now.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000]  There are of course those who do not want us to speak.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000]  We think, just let me think.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000]  Even now, orders are being sheltered to telephones and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000]  It's Chancellor Suttler.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:42.000]  Damn it, why? Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000]  Words are for the means to meaning and for those who will listen, the enunciation of the truth.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000]  Stop it, please, stop it!
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000]  You designed it, sir, you wanted it foolproof, you told me every television end longer!
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:10.000]  Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression, and where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have sensors and systems of surveillance, coercing your conformity and suppressing your submission.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000]  We need cameras.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:25.000]  How did this happen? Who's to blame? Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others, they will be held accountable, but again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:39.000]  I know why you did it, I know you were afraid, who wouldn't be? War, terror, disease, there were a myriad of problems inspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Suttler.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000]  He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:09.000]  There is a war, it's happening now, it will decide the fate of humanity, the time to choose sides has come, we are the resistance.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:21.000]  I mean, I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information this powerful, and I hope that you pay attention to what we cover here minute by minute, because I've had chills since last night.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]  This just confirms everything else we've already researched.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:38.000]  A Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite, millions being killed, mandatory quarantines, checkpoints, the end of the family, everything that's in the other documents,
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:46.000]  but this dovetails with all the other Rockefeller Foundation documents about the GMO food to sterilize you, and the forced vaccines, and the hell we're already living in,
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.000]  this is going to continue to intensify until we take our governments back from these eugenics madmen, but that story is up on prisonplanet.com.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.000]  The question is, will you have the courage to really do the research yourself, because I don't want you to just sit here and hear me make these claims.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:13.000]  These people are so arrogant that they write policy papers, so many of them, that they're producing these policy papers and reports and white papers so fast that you could never read them all.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]  It is an open conspiracy against you and your family.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:26.000]  I pray to God, I pray to my Heavenly Father Jesus Christ every night to give me the strength and the will to be able to face this harm, and to give me the strength to carry on,
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:34.000]  because I know why a lot of you don't want to look at this information and just want to comment on the YouTube videos or on message boards that I'm a liar.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]  I know why, because it's scary.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000]  You're not going to be able to go to the ball games anymore.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:53.000]  You're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends. You're not going to be able to just go out and enjoy yourself all the time.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:04.000]  The only chance we've got of beating this scientific dictatorship, this creeping death that takes its time to incrementally enslave you,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:18.000]  mentally, psychologically, physically, spiritually, the only way to defeat it is for the rank and file of this planet to realize that you have a choice to make on what your destiny is going to be.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:26.000]  Once you face this information, once you've consciously admitted it to yourself, it will take over your life. It should take over your life.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000]  I mean, what else? What else could it do?
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:42.000]  We've got to get past the artificial stigma that the control corporate media has been putting out for decades ahead of their open unveiling of planetary dictatorship.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000]  They all talk about how we need a police state to carry this out.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:55.000]  Canada and the United States are going to work in lockstep to display the seriousness of our commitment at both home and abroad.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000]  Win, lose, or draw, you need to choose a side.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:12.000]  It's been three years since we had it. We got it back in stock, the amazing 30 parts per million, highest quality colloidal silver in all the great things and all the great uses, back in stock, limited supply.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:24.000]  Infowarsstore.com, 30% off, and it's a very limited supply, but we have it back. Infowarsstore.com, Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:41.000]  The Infowars Live Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver has returned. Silver Bullet is the answer to Alex's extensive search for a powerful colloidal silver product that utilizes high quality processes to ensure for a truly unique product that has applications for both preparedness and success.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:53.000]  And regular use. It is amazing. It's got thousands of reviews, five star reviews. Infowarsstore.com, Silver Bullet returns to Infowarsstore.com.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000]  And while you're there, get some super female vitality, some turbo force, some brain force, and some brain force ultra.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:19.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news today.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:51.000]  He had just committed to play basketball at the University of Southern California, USC Trojans. We're working for more information on this and we will have it.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000]  But you don't think the issue is important enough for someone with your stature to speak out on it?
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:08.000]  We're talking about individuals' bodies. We're not talking about something that's political or racism or police brutality and things of that nature.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:17.000]  We're talking about people's bodies and well-beings. So I don't feel like, for me personally, that I should get involved in what other people should do for their bodies and their livelihoods.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:30.000]  Anything I do on the floor is predicated to my family for the majority. For 99.9% of that. It's about the health and safety of my family and that's what it came down to.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000]  Me being available to my teammates on the floor is me taking care of my body.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000]  Do you mind me asking if you're confirming that you did get the vaccine?
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]  It's not a big deal.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000]  Not a big deal. I asked Ernest Ramirez about Ernest Ramirez Jr. dropping dead four days after he took it on the basketball court.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:03.000]  So he was in great shape. 14 years old. He's joining us from Austin on his lunch hour over Skype.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:27.000]  And so is Dr. Joseph Mercola on the massive increase in major insurance company numbers only in countries that took the experimental mRNA, Pfizer, or Moderna shots of almost a 600% increase in blood clots, cardiac arrest, stroke, you name it.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]  And in young athletes, it's a multi-thousand percent increase.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:56.000]  And we've had medical doctors on that explain that if you take one of these COVID shots and you're in really good shape like a long distance runner, or a long distance biker, or a basketball player, or an NFL wide receiver that has an incredible sprinting power like a racehorse, that it just ravages the heart.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000]  Now we're very sad for LeBron James this has happened, but let me tell you about the control.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:15.000]  It didn't break until three hours ago that his son yesterday on the college basketball court had cardiac arrest.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000]  That means his heart stopped. He was dying. Just like the NFL player.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:37.000]  They were able to cover up it was a shot in this case, in that case, but in this case, the dad and the son of the family were very vocal that they took the shots and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar criticized LeBron James because he didn't call people basically Nazis that didn't take it.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000]  LeBron said that's wrong. They have a right to not take it. This is about your body, your choice.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:10:06.000]  So I've been critical of LeBron James, some of the things he's done, not criticizing NBA China policies, not standing up for Uyghurs, but at the same time, he's better than Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who is a horrible, horrible person, not just on that front, but so many, an absolute stooge of the establishment.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:16.000]  So his son was set to be a number one draft pick. The experts were saying there he was starting his first career in college basketball.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:26.000]  And once you've had a cardiac arrest, folks, the doctors don't let you ever play again in a high intensity sport. His career is over.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:48.000]  And I hope that unlike Jamie Foxx, who I know this establishment's told, don't talk about the shots, he was already mad about the shots, told Peter McCullough he was, we're trying to get on today, Dr. McCullough, not Mercola, Mercola said, Dr. Peter McCullough, he met with him, said I want to meet with you, it was a private conversation, but it was about the shot, and he had concerns.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:11:02.000]  So we have a witness, a doctor, that met with Jamie Foxx who was concerned before he took one shot. We know he took up to three shots to be on these stupid Hollywood sets, and now Jamie Foxx almost died.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000]  He said he went to hell, basically. Well, he looks like hell now. I'm very sad for him.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:28.000]  So out of lemons, we can make lemonade, I hope that LeBron James' son does not die. With regular myocarditis that undoubtedly triggered this, it's the same MO, around 50% of those that get myocarditis when they're young, particularly males, die within five years.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:51.000]  So just because you survive the first heart attack does not mean you survive down the road. You'll probably have to have heart ablation where they burn up large parts of the heart. This is a very serious situation.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:10.000]  I just learned about this when I got into the office. I hadn't seen it because they're really suppressing it, even though I was searching news this morning. I got in here about an hour before showtime came in, and the crew ran in, rightfully, and knew it was a big deal, and said, hey, you know about LeBron James having a, well, LeBron James' son having a heart attack on the basketball court?
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:24.000]  And I said, no. They said, yeah, it just broke about an hour ago. That's now about two, three hours ago. And I just said, oh, my gosh, this is such an opportunity for LeBron James to, for all his issues, does seem to care about his family.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:37.000]  You don't care about the Uyghur slave camps and the rest of it. Could you perhaps care about the fact that this has now happened to your son?
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:13:06.000]  Now, remember, we know all over the world, Pfizer and Moderna both did this as part of what they call range finding. They sent out 50% on average placebo, 30 to 40% watered down very, very weak, and 10% or less super dangerous, super strong range finding to see what is more deadly, what causes bigger problems.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000]  .
[00:13:08.868 --> 00:13:18.948]  So, this is very sad, but imagine the fact that when it's a prominent person like Jamie
[00:13:18.948 --> 00:13:32.628]  Foxx or LeBron James' son, Bronny, imagine how big an opportunity this is for him to
[00:13:32.628 --> 00:13:40.868]  now go public, LeBron James and his son, and now talk to Dr. Peter McCullough or Dr. Joseph Mercola
[00:13:41.428 --> 00:13:46.388]  or the countless other medical doctors and scientists and top heart experts that have
[00:13:46.388 --> 00:13:51.268]  come out predicting this. But let's talk about Dr. Michael Yudon. The former chief scientist
[00:13:51.268 --> 00:13:56.468]  at Pfizer retired a few years before COVID was released. With top scientists in Europe,
[00:13:56.468 --> 00:14:02.308]  he's British, he put out an emergency lawsuit report to the EU board in December of 2020,
[00:14:02.788 --> 00:14:07.188]  right before they rolled it out against everybody, and said it's going to cause heart attacks,
[00:14:07.188 --> 00:14:14.628]  myocarditis, blood clots, and strokes. He knew by looking at it because they've done similar
[00:14:14.628 --> 00:14:24.388]  studies with mRNA on rats. And guys, can we put up the document? Anybody can type this
[00:14:24.388 --> 00:14:29.668]  into the search engine, it'll come up. In October of 2000, CDC guidelines
[00:14:30.308 --> 00:14:36.948]  warned of potential problems with mRNA shot. And in the two pages it lists heart attacks,
[00:14:37.988 --> 00:14:44.068]  myocarditis. We cannot hammer that enough, a government document that they just put in
[00:14:44.068 --> 00:14:50.468]  a slideshow that they put in Congress and that they put on YouTube at a CDC
[00:14:50.468 --> 00:14:55.108]  forum with the head of the CDC and all the top people. We're going to pull that up.
[00:14:55.108 --> 00:14:59.908]  That was beyond critical before the broadcast began. All hands on deck till we find that
[00:14:59.908 --> 00:15:04.228]  document. Maximum effort, maximum. We must show them. It doesn't matter,
[00:15:04.228 --> 00:15:12.068]  we've showed this document a thousand times. Maximum effort, maximum effort,
[00:15:12.948 --> 00:15:19.988]  maximum effort, maximum effort, maximum effort, maximum effort, maximum effort.
[00:15:19.988 --> 00:15:22.468]  We're going to go to break. Come back.
[00:15:26.948 --> 00:15:30.468]  We're trying to save lives here. We're trying to take this serious, but the globalists get us
[00:15:30.468 --> 00:15:36.388]  into a kind of helplessness, a kind of learned helplessness mode where we just get used to being
[00:15:36.388 --> 00:15:41.988]  attacked. We get used to being killed. We get used to being savaged. And it's just so
[00:15:41.988 --> 00:15:49.028]  incredible. I will show you the CDC key document when we come back. And now they admit it's
[00:15:49.028 --> 00:15:54.068]  linked to that. But that's, that's not the October 2000 document.
[00:15:59.508 --> 00:16:04.308]  When I tell you we have the ultimate bone broth, hands down, this is the most concentrated,
[00:16:04.308 --> 00:16:10.628]  high quality bone broth there is. Concentrated chicken broth, patented, amazing. Then a huge

[00:17:58.548 --> 00:18:01.828]  You wanted to plug rainforest. Do you like rainforest? Yeah. So
[00:18:01.828 --> 00:18:06.708]  my name is Ken Hackenladly. How do I write all the books that I do? Four books with Dr. Judy
[00:18:06.708 --> 00:18:11.188]  Mikovits, four books with Project Veritas whistleblowers, and now two books with Alex
[00:18:11.188 --> 00:18:17.588]  Jones. That's because I use brain force every day. What I always need is I always need
[00:18:17.588 --> 00:18:22.388]  some sort of boost in the morning. And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well,
[00:18:22.388 --> 00:18:28.068]  take good vitamins. But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is brain
[00:18:28.068 --> 00:18:33.588]  force. I'll take brain force in the morning, right before I go to my computer. And I'm good
[00:18:33.588 --> 00:18:38.308]  for the next four or five hours, writing a whole lot of stuff. So it really is true
[00:18:38.308 --> 00:18:42.868]  that brain force is something I use every day and it helps me with my writing. All right,
[00:18:42.868 --> 00:18:46.388]  we love you. We'll be right back. Get your brainforce plus brainforce ultra
[00:18:46.388 --> 00:18:50.148]  and turbo force at info war store.com. We'll be right back with our number two.
[00:18:59.668 --> 00:19:04.548]  I talk a lot about the great successes info wars has had. I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:19:05.108 --> 00:19:08.308]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:19:09.108 --> 00:19:12.628]  But when we talk about the crew at info wars, people behind the scenes, the researchers,
[00:19:12.628 --> 00:19:19.348]  the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight. And we look at Harrison Smith
[00:19:19.348 --> 00:19:24.068]  and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[00:19:24.868 --> 00:19:29.028]  It's really just incredible. So for myself, the whole info wars crew, I thank you for
[00:19:29.028 --> 00:19:34.708]  your past support. I only encourage you now to realize that info wars cannot stay on air if
[00:19:34.708 --> 00:19:38.788]  you do not support us. I know you spread the word. I know you pray for us. That's wonderful.
[00:19:38.788 --> 00:19:43.428]  Keep doing it. But most viewers and listeners never go to enforce store.com.
[00:19:43.428 --> 00:19:46.308]  And you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[00:19:46.308 --> 00:19:50.388]  All at the same time, give us on air. I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually
[00:19:50.388 --> 00:19:54.628]  go buy products in four store.com. If just 1% more of you took action,
[00:19:54.628 --> 00:19:58.388]  it went to enforce or.com. Our funny problems will be over. Please take action now.
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:07.840]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:34.660]  By the way, the crew is amazing, it's my fault because I'm operating from memory.
[00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:40.540]  I'm like, get me the CDC document showing that they knew it would cause heart attacks, myocarditis,
[00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:44.940]  especially in young men, before they even began the injections.
[00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:48.379]  And it's an FDA document, that's why I was flipping out.
[00:20:48.379 --> 00:20:53.900]  But then they pulled up a CDC that I'd forgotten about from last year admitting that these
[00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:56.140]  shots are linked to heart attacks and myocarditis.
[00:20:56.140 --> 00:21:00.700]  So again, I mean, you can't miss for swinging because it's just total death.
[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:06.340]  And we had Edward Dowd on yesterday with a 522% increase in the insurance company numbers
[00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:11.180]  and the British government's numbers as well in myocarditis, blood clots, everything.
[00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:13.460]  I mean, it's just all right here, they're murdering us.
[00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:16.540]  Let me show you some of these documents right here.
[00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:18.139]  Overhead shot, please.
[00:21:18.139 --> 00:21:22.500]  Cardiac complications after SARS-CoVid-2 infection and mRNA-CoVid vaccination.
[00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:25.420]  They thought it's way higher when you've taken the shots.
[00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:29.020]  That's CDC Centers for Disease Control, April 2022.
[00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:32.420]  Now we'll put the FDA document on air.
[00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:37.860]  FDA to add warning to Pfizer Moderna vaccines about rare heart issues in young, oh, years
[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:38.860]  after they did it.
[00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:42.660]  But that's not them putting the warning on last year.
[00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:50.680]  No, that's in December, in October of 2020, before the shots started predicting it would
[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:55.460]  do just that because they knew exactly what they were doing.
[00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:58.500]  Now let that just sink in.
[00:21:58.980 --> 00:21:59.980]  Why do you get so upset on air?
[00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:00.980]  Why do you have so much energy?
[00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:04.220]  I go out to dinner with friends, I just sit there quietly, they go, you're a different
[00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:06.300]  person when you're not on air.
[00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:08.180]  Is it an act?
[00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:09.180]  No.
[00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:15.060]  When I sit here with stacks of documents with the British, German, US, Japanese government,
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:21.580]  all knowing that the shots were going to kill us and not protect us, I'm pissed.
[00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:25.060]  I'm not up here to play games with these people.
[00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:29.860]  And they have bullied so many people into having their children have these shots and the hospitals
[00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:34.420]  are full of children who have heart problems for the rest of their short lives, ladies
[00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:35.420]  and gentlemen.
[00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:40.660]  And I am angry, but the public doesn't care if their neighbor has a heart attack
[00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:41.660]  and dies.
[00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:42.820]  It's anecdotal, right?
[00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:48.220]  But when it's an NFL player or it's LeBron James' son, that gets their attention.
[00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:51.840]  Stalin said, when one man dies, it's a tragedy.
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:53.820]  When 10,000 dies, it's a statistic.
[00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:56.260]  So I'm very sad for LeBron James.
[00:22:56.260 --> 00:23:02.139]  But there was a debate, there was issues, earlier on when he hadn't taken the shot,
[00:23:02.139 --> 00:23:07.000]  he put out tweets saying, hey, how come there's no flu anymore?
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.860]  How come there's no cold anymore?
[00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:11.060]  They're just saying it's COVID, they're hyping this up.
[00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:17.860]  And he got attacked, and so he rolled his sleeve up with the system, and now you see
[00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:18.860]  what happened.
[00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:21.620]  And you say, well, why didn't he get sick?
[00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:26.740]  Because he probably got a placebo shot, which we told you was going on.
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:34.180]  We didn't know it was big pharma sending him out, so that it would confuse regulators
[00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:39.420]  and watchdogs, not knowing why some died or got sick and others didn't.
[00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:42.540]  So LeBron James and his family play Russian roulette.
[00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:48.700]  They took a revolver with six cylinders, and they spun it.
[00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:54.180]  And they put one cartridge in it and closed it with one bullet.
[00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:58.540]  And LeBron put it to his head and pulled the trigger, or his heart and his head, pulled
[00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:01.300]  the trigger and nothing happened.
[00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:04.300]  His wife did it, his other kids did it, hopefully nothing happened to them.
[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:12.620]  But his son, Bronny, when he pulled the trigger, boom, boom.
[00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:16.340]  When Ernest Ramirez's son took the shot when they went out to help society and
[00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:21.020]  be men, because they were told it would protect them and protect others, Ernest loaded the
[00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:24.940]  gun and pulled the trigger, and nothing happened.
[00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:32.260]  It went click, but when his son pulled the trigger, it went boom.
[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:33.900]  Guys, pull up Russian roulette.
[00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:36.340]  There's a great scene from Deer Hunter with Robert De Niro.
[00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:43.940]  Type in Deer Hunter, Robert De Niro, Russian roulette, or Robert De Niro, Russian roulette.
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:46.020]  It's a great scene from Vietnam.
[00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:52.300]  And that's the kind of stuff that the Vietnamese North did for entertainment.
[00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:54.740]  Our troops did stuff like that for entertainment as well.
[00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:55.980]  That's how crazy war is.
[00:24:55.980 --> 00:25:00.460]  It's got government documents that our troops made people play Russian roulette, they would
[00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:01.460]  torture people for fine.
[00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:03.460]  I mean, not all our troops, that goes on.
[00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:06.300]  It's based on fiction, but it's a good rendering.
[00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:08.020]  Here, here, here, here.
[00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:11.300]  Let's watch some Russian roulette and understand it.
[00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:12.300]  Here it is.
[00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:12.320]  Go ahead and roll it.
[00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:14.740]  In!
[00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:19.700]  I did not!
[00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:23.500]  Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God!
[00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:34.340]  Laughs
[00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:37.140]  I'm so loud, so loud!
[00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:39.060]  Laughs
[00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:53.240]  Take your shot. You can have your job. Take your shot. You can be in the movies. Take
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:26:00.940]  your shot, Ice Cube. It's good for walking. And Ice Cube said, I'm not putting that
[00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:20.139]  gun to my head. Put an empty chamber knife gun. Take your shot, Fauci says.
[00:26:20.139 --> 00:26:26.500]  Isn't it cute how they did it? It's going to be all right, Nicky. Go ahead, shoot.
[00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:43.820]  You shoot, Nicky. Oh, you're going to die, you motherfucker. You're going to die.
[00:26:43.820 --> 00:27:02.300]  Go ahead, Nicky. Go ahead, just do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it.
[00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:26.980]  And I haven't watched this movie in 20 years, but they do it again and the guy dies. So
[00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:29.580]  we're going to skip ahead and not make you watch that. We're going to stop right
[00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:35.260]  there. Good job crew pulling up in 10 seconds. So I'm going to explain something to you again.
[00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:42.540]  They literally set up Russian roulette where one of four things happens, nothing because
[00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:49.060]  it's water. And that's on average 50% of the ampules they sent out. Nothing happens.
[00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:54.460]  It's saline, saltwater around 40%. It's a mild dose. So you'll just get cancer and
[00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:59.780]  be sterilized. You'll die in like 15 years, 20 years, depending on your physiology. But
[00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:07.860]  on average, 10% or so get the really powerful shot. And if you're young and in shape,
[00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:14.500]  you are going to have a heart attack and probably die because the heart just pumps it
[00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:18.260]  right in. It grows, it explodes, and your heart doesn't know how to deal with it.
[00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:23.100]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen. You remember who did it? Peter Daszak,
[00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:27.139]  Fauci, the globalist. And you know what they're going to do when this all comes out?
[00:28:27.139 --> 00:28:31.139]  They're going to blame it on Trump. There's over 300 dead football players,
[00:28:31.139 --> 00:28:34.220]  you name it, around the world in the last three years from heart attacks.
[00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:39.240]  Normally it's about one death a year. It's over a hundred plus confirmed. It's massive.
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:43.340]  How many folks are going to have to have a heart attack and die right in front of you
[00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:48.620]  before you realize you've been hit with a chemical slash bio weapon nanotech protein
[00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:52.540]  crystal attack vector. We'll be right back. Stay with us.

[00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:15.500]  what's better knockout? What's better down and out? What's better? Why do you sell two or three
[00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:20.860]  different sleep aids? And the answer is different herbal formulas, different compounds are better
[00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:25.980]  for different people. So one person might like this coffee or the person likes that coffee.
[00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:30.420]  That's how our bodies work. They're all very diverse, but we've been able to private label
[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:35.260]  a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love and sell for lower

[00:32:01.659 --> 00:32:06.940]  shots or the electromagnetic five G or the GMO crops. They're hitting us with hundreds
[00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:12.380]  of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies and industry to use. One of the
[00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:18.180]  top pesticides used is atrazine. The allowable level the government admits that they allow to
[00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:23.580]  be in your water supply is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized
[00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:28.300]  mutant. Look it up. Don't let them do this to your family. We have the very best gravity

[00:32:58.870 --> 00:33:07.870]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:27.300]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well,
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:34.300]  so does he. Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:41.300]  So imagine if you had a global U.N. government setting up a worldwide treaty that says it
[00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:47.300]  openly owns your bodies, and they built emergency camps and set up contact tracing and all
[00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:51.300]  the cell phones and smart devices in your house and car to track and trace you, and
[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:56.300]  they were setting up the private armies of leftists to come arrest you and take you
[00:33:56.300 --> 00:34:00.300]  to those centers, not just if they thought you were sick with the virus they released,
[00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:07.300]  but to also take those that are going to disagree with the new lockdown. Under the globalist,
[00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:14.300]  Biden and his former COVID czar head up the U.N. operation right now. They've now permanently
[00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:20.300]  set up, as of last Friday, a new U.S. agency for pandemics, and this is going to be their
[00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:25.300]  cover for arresting their political enemies, rounding people up, and then forcibly injecting
[00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:31.300]  you. I know it's dystopic, but they just hit us with a poison shot. They just released
[00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:37.300]  COVID. That is a new virus that also killed a lot of people. And now LeBron James'
[00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:44.300]  son, Bronnie, suffered cardiac arrest yesterday, and it did not break until this morning.
[00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:51.300]  He is already set to be a college star. Word is he'll be a first round draft pick
[00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:57.300]  as soon as he wants to go in the NBA. Had a huge future ahead of him. And I can tell
[00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:03.300]  you, you suffer cardiac arrest in a high-intensity sport. You never play the sport again. His
[00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:11.300]  career is over. This is his dad's worth $500 million, and they're big and strong.
[00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:19.300]  They thought they were invincible, and they weren't. I remember my dad's dad was a really
[00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:25.300]  strong guy, and my dad would see him with this thing called Cooper Tox. They'd have
[00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:30.300]  flies and stuff all over the cows. Back then they still had screwworms. Both maggots
[00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:34.300]  just eat dead meat. Screwworms actually lay eggs, and then it actually eats the cow.
[00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:39.300]  And he saw him without mask and without gloves putting Cooper Tox on the backs of
[00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:46.300]  the cows and could see him breathing it. And my dad was a little brain kid, and he
[00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:52.300]  picked up the bag and said, Dad, this says wear respirator and gloves. And he looked
[00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:56.300]  at him and said, David, I'm tough. I can handle it. Bone cancer at 40-something,
[00:35:56.300 --> 00:36:01.300]  dead at 50. Lung cancer, bone cancer, ate him alive, and it was the Cooper Tox.
[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:05.300]  This isn't a game. No matter how big and strong you are, this will kill your ass.
[00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:11.300]  You understand that? Do you understand me out there? This ain't some frickin' game
[00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:16.300]  for the motherfuckers in the New World Order. Bill Gates wants to kill your ass.
[00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:27.300]  You better get that straight. He'll kill you if he can. Excuse my French,
[00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:35.300]  but sometimes it's the only way to get it across. So, I know they approached
[00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:39.300]  these people that have heart attacks for the shots, and they pressure you.
[00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:42.300]  And the doctors come and say, no, it wasn't the shot, because they don't want the liability,
[00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:47.300]  because they've been brought into the corruption. But this is the chance where LeBron James
[00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:52.300]  is going to have a chance to be a hero or a zero. He's going to have a chance
[00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:56.300]  at this point, like Tucker Carlson did when they told him he couldn't talk about
[00:36:56.300 --> 00:37:03.300]  vaccines and their dangers. And he told Fox News, you can piss up a rope.
[00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:08.300]  And they fired him over that and other reasons. He went from being a good guy to being
[00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:14.300]  a hero. This is the moment for LeBron James to not mince words and not play games.
[00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:18.300]  Hey, LeBron, there's heart attacks all over sports in all the high-intensity areas.
[00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:26.300]  Cycling, swimming, rugby, soccer, basketball, NFL, football. College football.
[00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:34.300]  It is an absolute curse. They are dropping dead all over. Now, the NFL is corrupt enough,
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:38.300]  and I say that in a good way, that they're famous for not following the law.
[00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:41.300]  So what if there's a regulation, you've got to take your COVID shot?
[00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:50.300]  The NFL, doctors are giving them saline. But the NBA has been worse about
[00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:59.300]  actually giving them the real shots. So that's where we are.
[00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:05.300]  And it's got to stop, ladies and gentlemen. Now, they wanted to get 99 percent of people
[00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:10.300]  injected so they wouldn't have a control group that wasn't injected so they could cover this up.
[00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:15.300]  That's not happened. About half the public took one shot.
[00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:21.300]  Thirty percent or so took two or three. And I got to tell you, it's just mind blowing.
[00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:24.300]  So let me do this. Let me play a little compilation of just I mean,
[00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:30.300]  I got stacks of news here where there's 20 or more prominent people this week that had blood clots,
[00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:34.300]  heart attacks, strokes, you name it. I'm talking about music stars,
[00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:39.300]  young people, country stars, pop stars, soccer players, football players.
[00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:44.300]  I mean, it's just actually I have four stacks right here.
[00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:47.300]  Older folks like Deion Sanders right down to college basketball players.
[00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:52.300]  I mean, it is crazy. People are dropping like flies.
[00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:58.300]  And we have the statistics from the insurance companies and from the British government because our government's had the statistics.
[00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:05.300]  The British government shows multi thousand percent increases in heart attacks in young people and strokes because they didn't used to happen.
[00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:11.300]  I mean, I remember growing up and one time a college basketball player dropped dead.
[00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:15.300]  Remember that like the 80s? I forget his name. And it was a huge investigation.
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:21.300]  And no one had ever seen anybody have a heart attack. Was he on cocaine or was it a congenital heart defect?
[00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:26.300]  No one knew. But it was it was just like I mean, I've been told by top scientists, older ones.
[00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:31.300]  That in the 50s and 60s, if there was a case of childhood cancer,
[00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:36.300]  doctors and scientists would travel across the country on an airplane to see it.
[00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:42.300]  Now they have cancer centers for children everywhere. This is just normalizing it.
[00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:48.300]  And now there's billboards on the sides of buses. Heart attacks and children are normal. Get used to it.
[00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:56.300]  What? Oh, it's the new normal. The new normal.
[00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:59.300]  So go ahead and roll it. Here it is.
[00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:02.300]  We begin our eight o'clock hour with this breaking news.
[00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:09.300]  LeBron James' son, Bronny, is recovering this morning after suffering cardiac arrest at USC.
[00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:15.300]  He reports it happened just before nine thirty in the morning during workouts at the Galen Center.
[00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:21.300]  The James family released a statement this morning saying Bronny is now out of the ICU.
[00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:28.300]  He's in stable condition. In the statement, the James family thanked USC's medical and athletic staff for their work.
[00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:31.300]  They've asked for respect and privacy.
[00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:39.300]  The 18 year old has committed to play for the Trojans in the fall with plans of entering the NBA draft when he becomes eligible in 2024.
[00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:43.300]  Again, he is in stable condition.
[00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:48.300]  But you don't think the issue is important enough for someone with your stature to speak out on it?
[00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:59.300]  You know, we're talking about individual's bodies. You know, we're not talking about something that's, you know, political or or racism or police brutality and things of that nature.
[00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:02.300]  We're talking about like people's bodies and well-being, you know?
[00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:08.300]  So I don't feel like for me personally that I should get involved in and what other people should do for their bodies and their livelihoods.
[00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:16.300]  Anything I do on the floor is predicated to my family, you know, for the majority, for ninety nine point nine percent of that.
[00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:21.300]  So, you know, it's about the health and safety of my family. And that's what it came down to.
[00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:25.300]  Me being available to my teammates on the floor and taking care of my body.
[00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:31.300]  Do you mind me asking if that if you're confirming that you did get the vaccine?
[00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:33.300]  It's not a big deal.
[00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:37.300]  We have a player down on the court. We'll try to get more information.
[00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:42.300]  Johnson taken out on a stretcher and rushed to local Tallahassee Memorial Hospital.
[00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:47.300]  Leading cardiologist says cluster of collapses and footballers likely to be just a coincidence.
[00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:51.300]  A terrible coincidence at that. But just a coincidence. Yes, just a coincidence.
[00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:54.300]  One of their high school football players died.
[00:41:54.300 --> 00:42:01.300]  Seventeen year old Everest Romney got his vaccine shot. And that is when doctors found out he had two blood clots inside his brain.
[00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:07.300]  Doctors baffled after sixteen year old football player and wrestler suffers a stroke and blood clot in his brain.
[00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:13.300]  Seventeen year old high school student dies suddenly after suffering critical medical emergency during flag football games.
[00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:18.300]  Sixteen year old high school football player collapses and dies after suffering medical emergency during practice.
[00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:24.300]  Family and doctors are baffled by the sudden and unexplained death of a sixteen year old Stanford high school football player.
[00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:30.300]  Buffalo built safety DeMar Hamlin in critical condition after collapsing on the field during the game.
[00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:34.300]  He was administered CPR before being taken away in an ambulance.
[00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:40.300]  Twelve year old Jason Kidd collapsed during warm ups at basketball practice. He died a short time later.
[00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:45.300]  A South Carolina high school football player has died after collapsing at football practice.
[00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:50.300]  Isaiah Turner died yesterday following a quote sudden catastrophic medical event.
[00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:56.300]  Seventeen year old Phillip Laster Jr. collapsed while practicing football on Monday.
[00:42:56.300 --> 00:43:03.300]  A sixteen year old student from West Catholic Preparatory High School collapsed while warming up for a scrimmage in Chester County.
[00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:08.300]  Two young athletes, the latest to die, suddenly prominent cardiologists tie an alarming trend to COVID shots.
[00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:11.300]  The hardest thing was I let him get that shot.
[00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:20.300]  COVID vaccines are now available for children five years and older.
[00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:25.300]  And the more people who get them, the better we're going to be able to help stop the spread of COVID.
[00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:28.300]  I'm here to implore you, go out and get vaccinated.
[00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:33.300]  I got mine months ago and I feel I felt so much better for it.
[00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:37.300]  He's not going on the tour of Japan.
[00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:55.300]  It's hitting the game, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:57.300]  This is Bill Gates killing you.
[00:43:57.300 --> 00:44:00.300]  Not what any of us want to see and everybody's around him.
[00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:02.300]  And he did die on the field.
[00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:03.300]  We'll be OK.
[00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:08.300]  So we'll take another break here in Cincinnati.
[00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:11.300]  Big for a nineteen year old kid.
[00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:12.300]  Wow.
[00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:13.300]  That's pretty amazing.
[00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:14.300]  You said it right.
[00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:15.300]  No, it's not amazing.
[00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:17.300]  This young, nineteen years old.
[00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:18.300]  It's the new normal.
[00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:19.300]  Each and every night.
[00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:20.300]  And he feels like he's belong.
[00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:25.300]  So I look for this kid to have a really good first half of the season.
[00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:26.300]  And.
[00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:36.300]  It's happening everywhere, vaccines you got, especially Gardasil,
[00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:47.300]  because that has the toxic synthetic lipid nanoparticles similar to the one in the covid shot prior to the covid shot, the deadliest vaccine.
[00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:51.300]  We saw athletes dropping dead on the field, passing out, falling down.
[00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:52.300]  All the things.
[00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:54.300]  Why is it particularly the athletes?
[00:44:56.300 --> 00:45:00.300]  Because they operate at oxygen max capacity max there.
[00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:04.300]  They're operating at such a high level in their mitochondria.
[00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:09.300]  This is an energy production, oxygen necessary disease.
[00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:10.300]  So they create.
[00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:11.300]  That's what they're finding.
[00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:13.300]  They turbo charge the blood clots.
[00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:14.300]  Correct.
[00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:15.300]  Wow.
[00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:18.300]  And extremely a lack of oxygen.
[00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:27.300]  So constricted blood vessels, too, because athletes are running, they're constricted, they're they're working so that the blood flows and it doesn't flow.
[00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:35.300]  And now we know it's in the pre-workout because the heart's already been damaged.
[00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:39.300]  Every time they're exercising after the shot, they've got major heart damage.
[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:42.300]  And finally, they go to that supercharged level.
[00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:44.300]  They've got really the heart now of a 60 year old man.
[00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:46.300]  You know, they're 15.
[00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:47.300]  You die.
[00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:51.300]  Or you have a heart attack and they got to turn your heart back on.
[00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:53.300]  But still, your heart's fried now.
[00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:58.300]  A little bit mad at Bill Gates now.
[00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:02.300]  I mean, I mean, folks, you're going to figure out this is all real sooner or later.
[00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:04.300]  The numbers from the insurance companies are in.
[00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:06.300]  The numbers from the governments are in.
[00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:07.300]  I'm getting chills right now.
[00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:10.300]  They are literally murdering us and laughing about it.
[00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:12.300]  They're killing hundreds of thousands a year with fentanyl.
[00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:13.300]  They're shipping that in.
[00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:16.300]  They're a bunch of crazy people.
[00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:19.300]  How do you think they'd attack America, folks, with bioweapons?
[00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:28.730]  Your own government attacking you, that's the plot of V for Vendetta.
[00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:32.370]  I was reading an interview with Hitler from 1933 where he said, I'm going to hit our enemies
[00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:34.410]  with bioweapons, they'll never know we did it.
[00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:41.580]  Because we won't take credit for it.
[00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:44.960]  These people mean business.
[00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:49.540]  By the way, I meant to call Mike Lindell today, but he reached out to me, and I knew I needed
[00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:50.540]  to reach out to him.
[00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:57.220]  I saw the headline last night, Mike Lindell had to borrow $10 million just for shortfalls
[00:46:57.220 --> 00:47:00.700]  to pay his employees or my pillow will shut down.
[00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:02.280]  He's never cried wolf.
[00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:08.340]  He spent the last five years fighting the globalists, at least $100 million.
[00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:11.800]  He leveraged everything he had, and he's firing the bat signal, I'm going to talk to him later
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:16.520]  today, he texted me, for you to support him and get made in America products while
[00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:17.520]  you still can.
[00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:22.160]  The products are in stock, you need slippers, you need bedsheets, you need towels, you
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:29.440]  need sheets, you need pillows, obviously, MyPillow.com, use promo code Alex.
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:32.880]  And if everybody just came through and rallied, kind of like when Willie Nelson had a giant
[00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:38.560]  tax bill back in the 80s, and people just bought his IRS tape and paid off his debt
[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:39.560]  in a week.
[00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:42.440]  Well, Mike Lindell has been arrested, they've kind of been trying to put him in prison
[00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:45.440]  for exposing election fraud, he's got a lot of courage.
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:47.680]  He's not worried about prison.
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:53.400]  He's just wanting support, so I go to MyPillow.com, and just when you're checking out, use promo
[00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:58.400]  code Alex, and you get a bigger discount, and that supports us a little bit, but that's
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:47:59.560]  really a side issue.
[00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:03.920]  Do you want to see him go down when he's such a fighter?
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:10.120]  You want him to prove that they are battling, and on all fronts, and appealing all these
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:14.520]  false rulings against him, and all the lawfare?
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:18.560]  Well, Mike Lindell will never give up, he'll never give in, but he could give out,
[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:20.460]  and we're the same.
[00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:24.360]  And so we get 10% of the sale, I know he's making like 20% on these products because
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:27.320]  he sells them for such low prices.
[00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:28.820]  So he has to have massive volume.
[00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:37.880]  Go to MyPillow.com, use promo code Alex, and everything is discounted massively.
[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:41.960]  You can't beat these deals, ladies and gentlemen, you cannot beat these deals.
[00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:45.800]  MyPillow.com, promo code Alex, it's all right there.
[00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:54.660]  The robes, the coffee, the roll-and-go-anywhere MyPillows, the children's Bible Story pillows,
[00:48:54.660 --> 00:49:00.940]  the Bible Story collection throw blankets, you want to fund pro-Christian, pro-God, pro-family,
[00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:06.540]  pro-liberty information, there it is, MyPillow.com, promo code Alex, or let the Globals win.
[00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:09.420]  And it's the same thing for our operation.
[00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:13.860]  We have climbed up out of the red, again, into the black, our rank of repsies going
[00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:18.660]  to be done, supposed to be done in August, now it's a little more court stuff going on,
[00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:23.700]  they say September, then free speech systems goes forward, reorganized, debt discharged,
[00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:28.600]  all that, dischargeable in that we can pay what we have and not the imaginary billions
[00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:31.660]  they say we do, totally made up, it's a sign up, make you think we have all this
[00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:32.660]  extra money.
[00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:35.740]  I don't have a million dollars in the bank myself, the company has a couple million,
[00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:38.580]  that's needed for payroll to buy a future product to fund ourselves.
[00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:44.140]  So we are on empty, but we have fuel, so we're in the black, just barely, like when you
[00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:47.960]  got to get home, and should I go to the gas station, or is that, I'm on empty, that's
[00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:51.900]  not even enough to get home and probably get back to a gas station, I better stop.
[00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:53.020]  We're there.
[00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:56.580]  And I've got to file a plan with the court for free speech systems, and if I don't have
[00:49:56.580 --> 00:50:02.380]  extra money, when I file the plan, we won't be able to budget for the election, hiring
[00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:06.380]  a couple more reporters back, and having budgets to go to the RNC and DNC and back
[00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:10.860]  to the border, and to all these big events that we want to go to, that I want to go on
[00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:15.620]  the road, because that always reaches millions of people, it always has a big effect, it's
[00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:19.180]  important, it's our mission, but we don't have the money, so we need to have extra
[00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:25.220]  money in the kitty, in the war chest, going into this to have a plan that's getting
[00:50:25.220 --> 00:50:28.020]  written up right now, but if the money's not there, you can't have it in the plan
[00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:33.740]  to say, hey, we have this much money, and we'd like to budget this much for operations.
[00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:38.740]  So that's where this goes, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:39.740]  Explain it again.
[00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:42.500]  We're going forward with our appeals.
[00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:45.860]  We get reorganized, the company continues, the appeals go on for years.
[00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:49.540]  We challenge these false court decisions from rigged courts against us, where judges
[00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:52.620]  said we were guilty, and judges told the juries we were guilty, and the judges told
[00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:56.820]  the jury I was a liar, I mean, just ridiculous kangaroo court stuff that makes the
[00:50:56.820 --> 00:51:00.580]  idiocracy judge look like a saint.
[00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:05.300]  That is the level that we're talking about here.
[00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:10.420]  And then any extra profits go into a settlement trust if we lose the appeals down the road,
[00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:13.540]  and that's the money they get, but the operation continues on.
[00:51:13.540 --> 00:51:18.000]  But there's not even money to pay any money to the kangaroo operation.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:21.740]  We just need money to keep this operation going, and to have an agreement with the
[00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:27.060]  court that if we bring in more money, part of that goes to runner operation the way it's
[00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:28.060]  supposed to be run.
[00:51:28.060 --> 00:51:36.740]  So go to mfoarstore.com right now and get nitric boost.
[00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:40.180]  You've heard Dr. Judy Mikovits talk about with all the stuff going on in the environment,

[00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:50.080]  nanotech prions and all the toxic waste and the nanoblastics and all the crap that's

[00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:08.260]  it for yourself as a man, but it's also great for a woman.

[00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:54.680]  Incredible new trail picks, mfoarstore.
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:53:06.800]  mfoarstore.com or 8-8-2-5-3-3-1-3-9 and I want to get a bigger war chest. Again, we're
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:13.400]  in Chapter 11, Subchapter 5, reorganization. And the court believes and the law believes,
[00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:17.560]  Congress believes, I believe, we're not debtor prisons like Europe and all the rest of it.
[00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:22.400]  We spearheaded the last 200 years getting rid of debtor prisons. We had those until
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:27.580]  1776. I'm not an indentured servant. They can have $50 trillion judgments against me by their
[00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:33.640]  kangaroo courts. It doesn't work like that. Companies and free speech get to keep going.
[00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:38.480]  We just reorganize and pay whatever extra we have and then we move on and we win. The
[00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:43.200]  public doesn't know because the media misrepresented how that works. And I didn't know that the
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:46.460]  bankruptcy almost shut us down because listeners thought we were gone. They thought
[00:53:46.460 --> 00:53:51.780]  it was over. They thought they'd never get products again. I said, no, it's a reorganization.
[00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:55.640]  Every product we are selling, we have in stock ready to ship. And finally, folks are coming
[00:53:55.640 --> 00:54:00.600]  back and going, oh, you've been in bankruptcy a year and we don't see the news anymore
[00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:04.840]  because we told the court the truth. Do you think I'm stupid? They want to indict
[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:09.300]  me. Plus, I don't lie about stuff like that, but they're trying to indict me. They
[00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:13.340]  have the Justice Department, the day I was involved in bankruptcy, said in the news
[00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:19.340]  he will not be allowed to afford himself of the bankruptcy, the president said. And
[00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:24.560]  they had the Justice Department call the lawyers and call the people involved and say he doesn't
[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:29.600]  get access to that. Well, that didn't seem to work with the court. The Fed's calling
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:32.560]  up saying Alex Jones doesn't get access. But do you think I'm going to get up here
[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:37.640]  on air or go into that court and say anything wrong? Absolutely not. I'm not stupid.
[00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:44.640]  Plus, I wouldn't do it anyways. I'm a straight shooter. That's the power of this broadcast.
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:52.280]  So if you want us to spread our wings. And do an incredible job. And hire more reporters
[00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:58.060]  into a bunch of really powerful stuff at the face of all the attacks, not just still
[00:54:58.060 --> 00:55:03.180]  be on air, not just hang on, but dominate and win. Stalemates are not the place to
[00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:10.180]  be. Offense or death. Victory or death. Infowarsstore.com. Infowarsstore.com. It's going
[00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:19.640]  to be the place to be. You got products you need. MyPillow.com. MyPillow.com. MyPillow.com.
[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:23.840]  He's another champion in the arena. And in the modern world, you fight in information
[00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:28.660]  warfare with the truth. And it takes money when the enemy and the top law firms, the
[00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:32.220]  globalists come after you. But you don't even have to win those individual battles.
[00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:36.940]  You've got to persevere like George Washington did for six years, losing until the sixth
[00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:43.300]  year. But he persevered. He wore them out. And that's why I'll never give up. I'll
[00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:48.760]  never give in. And I want my enemies to know something. I'm loyal to this crew, but you
[00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:53.040]  demonizing me and making me the devil turned this into a folk hero operation, which I
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:58.680]  don't even deserve to be. I get almost nothing but love now. 99% love. It's insane.
[00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:03.040]  And I've got offers all over the place with systems that are bulletproof against
[00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:08.080]  all your BS, that are cut and dry. But I've not taken those deals because of this
[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:14.580]  crew and this operation and this brain trust out of loyalty and the symbol that this operation
[00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:20.340]  is. But know this, you strike this operation down, I'll become a thousand times more powerful.
[00:56:20.340 --> 00:56:25.140]  You have no idea what you've done. Just like Tucker Carlson, 5 million viewers a night,
[00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:31.060]  a hundred million viewers a night today. You're a joke. And you did not break our
[00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:36.900]  will because we have the Holy Spirit and God on our side. The new world order failed.
[00:56:36.900 --> 00:56:40.400]  And boy, what do you think? People see my children, they're bright eyed, they're bushy
[00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:44.840]  tailed. They have electricity in their eyes. They hardly ever get sick. And then you see
[00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:48.660]  all these other sickly kids taking the shots, the parents buying into it. But numbers
[00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:56.160]  show they went from 30% not taking vaccines four years ago to now something like 60% of
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:57:01.120]  refusing in Europe and about half in the US. People woke up, man, they know now it's
[00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:05.360]  poison. They know it's a fraud and more waking up all the time. So we're saving lives
[00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:09.940]  together. And I hope LeBron James does the right thing now. Oh, by the way, I forgot to tell you,
[00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:15.140]  big news next hour. Elon Musk came out and said he thinks it's the shot. He thinks
[00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:19.580]  LeBron James is from the shot. Elon Musk suggests 18 year old Bronnie James,
[00:57:19.580 --> 00:57:26.060]  cardiac arrest due to vaccine injury, myocarditis. Yeah, you can't stop the signal.
[00:57:26.060 --> 00:57:30.680]  You thought Alex Jones was the problem. Now you got Elon Musk, Tucker Carlson and Joe
[00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:42.380]  Rogan on your ass. The Lord works in mysterious ways. Praise God. Praise Jesus. Thank you for
[00:57:42.380 --> 00:57:45.340]  your Holy Spirit, Lord. We'll be right back with our number two.

[00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:55.380]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks. They have a lot of power, but they can be defeated,
[00:58:55.380 --> 00:59:00.220]  but some of their operations are going to take decades to stop. But one thing you can do right
[00:59:00.220 --> 00:59:04.700]  now is take control of your body and your family's body by purifying the water that you

[00:59:19.020 --> 00:59:23.320]  non detectable levels. This is what I use, which my family uses. It's the very best system out

[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:42.780]  This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives and stop the globalist
[00:59:42.780 --> 00:59:46.500]  from hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply. In some cases, they
[00:59:46.500 --> 00:59:54.960]  add the water supply like fluoride leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world
[00:59:54.960 --> 01:00:08.840]  order. It's Alex Jones. Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, I got so freaked out by LeBron
[01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:13.200]  James's son having a massive heart attack on the basketball court after taking the COVID death
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:18.120]  shot that I forgot to tell you was coming up today. Ernest Ramirez who lost his son just days
[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:23.100]  after the deadly shot here in Austin, Texas, a beautiful man. Very, very sad, but he's gone
[01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:26.780]  through obviously Dr. Joseph Mercola has been warning about the poison shot all along and it
[01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:31.340]  was totally vindicated and part of the dirty dozen, according to the new world order with
[01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:38.140]  JFK or RFK Jr. And then we have G Edward Griffin, the OG fighting the new world order
[01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:44.840]  in the third hour. And then Maria Z has attorney Thomas Wrens who will knock it out of the park
[01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:51.040]  on this same key subject. Now, obviously I've got a lot of other news here in my stack,
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:58.760]  but LeBron James's son having a big old heart attack after LeBron James is on record in news
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:03.840]  articles and videos saying the whole family took the shots. That is the big enchilada for
[01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:10.460]  me because that can save a lot of people. A lot of people go, whoa. Now they're already
[01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:14.700]  going to figure it out because LeBron James's son took it and they see people having heart
[01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:20.460]  attacks and myocarditis and strokes and blood clots. I mean, it's just everywhere in your
[01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:23.940]  own family. Your neighbors is death everywhere. Coroner's saying never seen anything like it.
[01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:27.420]  We're burying people everywhere. These weird giant blood clots were pulling out of a young
[01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:31.380]  people. Old people look like big old snakes. Never seen it before. What in the hell is this?
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:37.160]  I mean, this is, this is nanotech. This is spongiform encephalopathy. This is protein
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:43.040]  crystals that grow in your arteries and your veins. And that's just one of the horrible
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:46.760]  things it does. It goes to your testicles. It goes to your ovaries. I mean, they hit
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:52.100]  us hard, but it's a soft kill weapon. Meaning long-term it gets most people to take
[01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:57.080]  it. And even those that are exposed to it through shedding, but it's so deadly that upfront
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:02.140]  quite a few die, which is maybe they did it a little too strong. In fact, at first
[01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:05.580]  they were putting a really deadly one. So they backed off and put out more placebo,
[01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:09.960]  more saline, like a little too obvious how we're blasting the hell out of them.
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:14.020]  So you just heard about the Manhattan Project in movies. It's a lot of fiction
[01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:19.560]  in it when you saw it like, you know, the latest movie that's out right now about
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:27.060]  the atomic bomb and the rest of it. And it's the same thing. It's a Manhattan Project
[01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:31.440]  taking place to depopulate the earth. And it's a bunch of scientists who are
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:37.000]  self-appointed that are doing it. So LeBron James' son, Burani, suffers cardiac
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:44.080]  arrest at USC practice. Yesterday they kept it shut down until today. That is
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:49.360]  media control. Here's LeBron James in Sports Illustrated in 2021. He'd been
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:54.840]  criticized by a lot of folks like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for not calling people
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:57.420]  racist. They don't tag it. And he said, no, no, you should tag it, but you
[01:02:57.420 --> 01:03:01.060]  shouldn't call people racist. And he said, I know that for me, I can speak
[01:03:01.060 --> 01:03:04.780]  about myself. James said, I think everybody has their own choice to do
[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:07.940]  what they feel is right with themselves and their family and the things
[01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:13.140]  that of that nature. I know that I was very skeptical about it all, but
[01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:16.700]  after doing my research, the things of that nature, I feel that it was the
[01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:22.100]  best suited for me, not only, but for my family and my friends. And that's
[01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:28.400]  why I decided to do it. So LeBron James at first wouldn't take it. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:31.000]  and a bunch of folks said, you're going to hurt people. You know,
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.640]  racists don't take it and all the rest of this. So then LeBron James
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:38.200]  said, okay, I didn't believe in it, but I took it. I believe it's the
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:44.640]  best thing. And I understand why a lot of these people that are in
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:47.400]  Hollywood and sports don't want to get political because they want to
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:50.000]  make everybody happy. Oh, I'm not going to criticize China for slave
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.400]  camps. They're buying a lot of tickets to see me. Oh, but I mean,
[01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:56.600]  at some point though, you got to stand up or you lose everything. And
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:00.300]  now your son's career is over. And you know, it's the shot. I
[01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:03.000]  mean, there's heart attacks everywhere in, in sports. Now with
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.000]  young people never, never happened. I mean, once or twice every
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.900]  decade, now it's every day. So LeBron, you, you, you really
[01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:14.360]  think keeping your neck down, keeping your head down has kept
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:18.500]  you safe. No sticking your neck out is what builds civilization.
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:22.800]  Standing up for what's right is what builds civilization. And
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:26.100]  you're lucky your son's not dead, but studies show most
[01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:29.400]  people that have heart attacks related with this will be dead in
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:33.700]  a few years. Regular microcarditis kills about half the
[01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:36.700]  people within five years. According to top scientists we've
[01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:39.800]  had on show, there's a good chance your son, I'm sorry to
[01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:42.500]  tell you, is going to end up dying from this. Maybe he'll
[01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:44.700]  have to be 30 years old, but you're going to be good
[01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:48.600]  chance. Outliving your son, LeBron, was it worth it to
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:51.600]  listen to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar bully you into this? Was it
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:54.400]  worth it after all the death you saw to still tell
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:55.400]  your son to do this?
[01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:03.300]  When I tell you we have the ultimate bone broth, hands
[01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:05.900]  down, this is the most concentrated high quality bone
[01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:10.000]  broth there is. Concentrated chicken broth, patented

[01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:10.500]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation. It's
[01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:14.200]  Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines
[01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:15.100]  of the Infowars.
[01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:19.600]  Well, if you are just now tuning in, I wouldn't
[01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:21.100]  blame you for not knowing about it. It happened
[01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:23.200]  yesterday, but it's getting very little coverage
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:26.800]  because the establishment tried to suppress it. Yesterday
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:30.700]  afternoon, LeBron James' son, Bronny, set in the future
[01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:34.800]  to be a number one NBA draft pick. Practicing at
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:38.900]  USC, stubborn cardiac arrest, that means his heart
[01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:43.300]  turned off, and he had to be resuscitated and taken
[01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:44.100]  to the hospital.
[01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:49.300]  And they're busy telling us how he's just fine right
[01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:52.800]  now. Just like everybody else is just fine.
[01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:57.600]  Now, Ernest Ramirez, early on, he and his son
[01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:59.700]  believed the lies, and that's not their fault.
[01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:02.800]  They were lied to, and said, protect yourself, protect
[01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:05.500]  others. This shot makes it where you can't spread
[01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:08.000]  it, you can't get it. Do the right thing, go
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.700]  take it. And he and his son went and took it.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.600]  I know it's hard for him to relive it all the time,
[01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:16.300]  valiantly going around the country, and in major documentary
[01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:19.600]  films, and warning now, tens of millions show Ernest
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:23.000]  Ramirez's son, Jr., we know is looking down from
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.300]  heaven. I'm very proud of his father, and Ernest's
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:31.400]  death has not been in vain. Ernest Jr., because his
[01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:35.000]  father isn't doing what a bunch of other fathers
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000]  I know of are doing, and I have a whole stack
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.900]  of it. When their daughter, their son dies or has
[01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:41.200]  heart attack, they keep their mouth shut. Despite
[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:43.600]  all the actuaries, insurance company, and government
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:45.500]  documents, I'm going to show you while he's talking,
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:48.200]  you're a TV viewer, where they knew this. And
[01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:51.200]  I showed this to you last hour. New viewers,
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:52.700]  I'm going to show it to you again. This is the
[01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:54.800]  FDA and CDC documents, you can go to their
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:57.300]  own websites and read it, where they predicted
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:59.600]  in October of 2000, three months before the
[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:02.400]  shots rolled out, heart attacks, myocarditis, blood
[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:06.200]  clots, and strokes. Show it to you again. This
[01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:09.500]  is the CDC recently saying, okay, our studies show
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:12.100]  the shot does cause heart attacks, myocarditis,
[01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:16.000]  blood clots, and strokes. But we can put on
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.600]  screen the FDA document, where in October, they
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:23.300]  warned that that indeed was the case of 2020.
[01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:26.100]  We'll put that on screen, please. Everyone knew
[01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:29.200]  what was coming at the FDA, and they covered
[01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:32.000]  that up. Now they call it rare and admit, oh,
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.900]  it's rare. No, it's not rare. Here's the
[01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:37.200]  article, FDA actually releases list of COVID
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:40.400]  vaccine, side effects of myocarditis, autoimmune
[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:44.300]  disease, and death. We didn't even learn about
[01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:45.800]  it for months after they did it. We have
[01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:48.300]  the documents all right there. There it is on
[01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:50.500]  screen. I want to just shut the record straight.
[01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:53.200]  And here's Edward Dow, the big statistician, you
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:55.100]  know, the top guy that got the statisticians
[01:08:55.100 --> 01:08:57.500]  on board to research it. The government's own
[01:08:57.500 --> 01:09:02.000]  numbers in the UK, 522% increase in blood
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.600]  clots, and even more in heart attacks, myocarditis,
[01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:10.500]  particularly in young males. Ernest Ramirez,
[01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:12.500]  we really appreciate joining us on his lunch
[01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:14.400]  hour. I know it's hard to look at. We'll
[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:17.000]  put pictures of his son on screen and pictures
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:21.700]  of him at his memorial service. This will
[01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:24.200]  save lives. Ernest, thank you. I want you
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:25.500]  to later recap what happened to you and
[01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:27.400]  your son and where you've gone from there.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.600]  But first, God bless you for having the
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:33.000]  courage to still continue to do this. I know
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.100]  it's hard. I have children that's traumatized
[01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:37.500]  and even see what happened to your son just
[01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:38.800]  through the empathy I have. I know that's
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:40.000]  nothing compared to what you've gone through,
[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:41.700]  but hopefully we can save some lives here
[01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:44.000]  today. And hopefully LeBron James will be
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.400]  like you and come out and warn people
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:48.200]  because we know he was bullied into this.
[01:09:48.300 --> 01:09:49.400]  We know he didn't want to take it at
[01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:51.800]  first. He said that in the news, but he
[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:53.600]  went ahead and bought the BS and did it.
[01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:55.800]  He should be really pissed and he should
[01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:58.200]  know his son's not out of the woods yet,
[01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:00.200]  but he should really care about other
[01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:02.000]  young people. Ernest Ramirez.
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:04.500]  How are you doing, sir?
[01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:05.400]  Thank you again.
[01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:07.400]  Well, what are we supposed to be doing
[01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:10.000]  now? I'm running out of options.
[01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:14.700]  We, these people, if I'm still getting
[01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:17.000]  messages and phone calls from across
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.700]  the world, why? I know they're seeing
[01:10:19.700 --> 01:10:22.400]  it there. Everyone here in the US knows
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:23.200]  what's going on.
[01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:26.000]  Why don't you use your own head, you
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.800]  know, think about it. This could have
[01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:29.400]  been prevented. You know, I've been
[01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:32.700]  screaming for two years and, you know,
[01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:34.400]  naturally, if somebody would have even
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:36.800]  brought it up before we got vaccinated,
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:39.200]  I would have thought over and over
[01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:42.000]  before I even done it. It's not worth
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.700]  it. We, I don't know what else to
[01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:47.700]  do. I mean, give me some ideas Alex,
[01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:50.500]  you know, I, you know, I'm traveling
[01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:53.600]  as much as I can, but I would love
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:55.200]  to keep that trailer rolling across
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:11:00.000]  the US 24-7. But, you know, financially
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.500]  it's impossible. Well, people
[01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:03.700]  should support what you're doing,
[01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:06.500]  website juniorsguardianvoice.com
[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:09.800]  and on Twitter, G, on Twitter,
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:14.800]  RGVrunner, RGVrunner01 or just
[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:18.000]  Google Ernest Romero Sr. So pulling
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.200]  back from this, I know that that
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:22.700]  Jamie Fox approached Dr.
[01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:24.800]  Peter McCullough, they met, he wasn't
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:26.000]  officially a patient, but he doesn't
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:26.900]  want to say what he said, but he
[01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:28.000]  said for the interest of the public,
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.800]  I will say he was skeptical about
[01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:31.200]  the shot and was concerned. Well,
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:32.500]  we heard that in the news, but
[01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:33.600]  Jamie Fox went ahead and took
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:35.400]  one shot and got sick, got pissed
[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:36.700]  off, took another, almost killed
[01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:38.100]  him. Well, where's Jamie Fox
[01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:40.000]  coming out warning people? Because
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.400]  the big pharma, I guarantee you,
[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:42.400]  reaches out and says, don't do
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:43.400]  that. It will come after you.
[01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:44.900]  It's all about the money. So
[01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:46.400]  you'll die. You'll get sick.
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:47.400]  You'll get maimed. You'll
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:48.900]  let your son's NBA career be
[01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:50.500]  ruined. I mean, this is just
[01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:52.700]  crazy. We need, what is your,
[01:11:52.700 --> 01:11:55.000]  do you want to challenge what
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.500]  are your words to LeBron James?
[01:11:57.700 --> 01:11:59.300]  Well, the thing is, is your
[01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:01.000]  career more important than your
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.100]  child? I mean, that's the
[01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:04.100]  way I look at it. There was
[01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:05.100]  nothing more important than my
[01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:07.900]  own son. So why would I care
[01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:09.100]  what people think or what
[01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:10.100]  people are going to tell me
[01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:11.800]  if I had my son here, I
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:13.300]  would speak out, you know, to
[01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:14.700]  protect him and other
[01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:17.000]  children. I mean, that's,
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:17.900]  that's supposed to be our
[01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:19.600]  job, Alex. Well, isn't it to
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:22.700]  protect our families? Uh, you
[01:12:22.700 --> 01:12:24.500]  know, man up, please. I'm
[01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:27.700]  sorry. Uh, you're someone
[01:12:27.700 --> 01:12:28.500]  out there in the public
[01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:30.700]  side. Yeah. Do the right
[01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:32.700]  thing. Stand up, be a man.
[01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:33.800]  This is what happened to my
[01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:36.000]  son and try to help, you
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.400]  know, spread the word, bring
[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:40.600]  awareness. A career is not
[01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:41.900]  worth it. Not worth our
[01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:44.000]  child. So, you know, well,
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.600]  I can see from the photos
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:46.900]  that you guys were very
[01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:49.300]  close and you were a single
[01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:50.300]  father, correct? That's
[01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:52.500]  that's quite a bond. Yes,
[01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:53.700]  sir. Uh, I raised him
[01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:54.700]  since the day he was
[01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:55.600]  born, he was given to
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:56.600]  me and that was the best
[01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:57.900]  gift I could ever receive
[01:12:57.900 --> 01:12:58.700]  from anyone in the
[01:12:58.700 --> 01:13:00.300]  world. I've always said
[01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:01.700]  children are a gift from
[01:13:01.700 --> 01:13:04.200]  God. And like I said, he
[01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:05.300]  was my best friend. He
[01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:07.900]  was, he was my world.
[01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:09.900]  And after they took my
[01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:11.900]  son, I no longer have a
[01:13:11.900 --> 01:13:14.800]  world. Uh, so what, I
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:15.700]  don't have anything else
[01:13:15.700 --> 01:13:16.900]  to lose. That's why I
[01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:17.900]  always said the government
[01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:19.500]  will never scare me. They
[01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:20.500]  can threaten me. They
[01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:22.300]  can, uh, do whatever
[01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:23.900]  they want because if
[01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:24.800]  anything were to ever
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:26.600]  happen to me, I know the
[01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:27.200]  good Lord's going to
[01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:28.100]  take me home to be with
[01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:29.500]  my son and by his side
[01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:31.500]  also. So, but I know
[01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:32.000]  that's not going to
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.100]  happen for a long time
[01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:34.900]  because I'm fighting this
[01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:36.800]  fight for my son and
[01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:37.700]  mainly for the good
[01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:39.100]  Lord. You know, God
[01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:40.900]  put me here and I have
[01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:43.500]  a purpose. Uh, so I
[01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:44.300]  have to continue this
[01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:45.300]  fight, you know,
[01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:46.700]  because I have to
[01:13:46.700 --> 01:13:47.600]  honor what I've been
[01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:49.500]  asked to do. Absolutely.
[01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:51.200]  Let's talk about, there's
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:52.300]  a real parallel here
[01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:53.500]  because people can see
[01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:54.700]  the 500 plus percent
[01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:55.900]  increase in blood clots
[01:13:55.900 --> 01:13:57.100]  or the 2000 plus
[01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:57.700]  percent increase in
[01:13:57.700 --> 01:13:58.500]  heart attacks, young
[01:13:58.500 --> 01:13:59.400]  people in the strokes
[01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:00.800]  exploding and, and all
[01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:02.000]  the numbers, but, but
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:02.900]  it's personal things
[01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:04.000]  that people actually get.
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:05.300]  And so your son liked
[01:14:05.300 --> 01:14:07.300]  basketball and that was
[01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:09.300]  where he died. Uh, so
[01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:11.100]  show a brawny. James
[01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:11.900]  didn't die, at least
[01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:14.100]  not yet. Uh, and we
[01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:15.800]  hope he doesn't, but
[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:17.000]  your son was in good
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:17.800]  shape. Your son was
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:18.800]  healthy, but it's the
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:19.700]  same thing when it's,
[01:14:19.700 --> 01:14:20.700]  when they first warm
[01:14:20.700 --> 01:14:22.000]  up, hit the field.
[01:14:22.300 --> 01:14:23.100]  And I've had doctors
[01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:24.300]  on that explained that
[01:14:24.900 --> 01:14:25.500]  one of daughters
[01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:26.100]  explained to you why
[01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:27.300]  healthy young people,
[01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:29.500]  particularly males, these
[01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:30.400]  shots are so deadly.
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:31.000]  Well, what I'm told
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.400]  is, uh, the virus
[01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:33.600]  needs high oxygen to
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:34.700]  replicate and the
[01:14:34.700 --> 01:14:35.600]  vaccine's the same as
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:36.700]  the virus despite
[01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:37.400]  protein. And so a
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:38.200]  healthy young man's
[01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:39.400]  heart is just what
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:40.100]  it's looking for.
[01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:42.700]  Yes, sir. They used
[01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:44.300]  to like, my son had
[01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:45.500]  been in sports since
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:46.800]  he was seven years old.
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:48.400]  Uh, that was like
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:49.300]  I've said before, that
[01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:50.000]  was something we
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:50.900]  enjoyed doing together.
[01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:52.100]  He played baseball
[01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:54.000]  from the age of
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:54.600]  seven all the way
[01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:55.400]  up to high school.
[01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:56.800]  And during this
[01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:58.300]  COVID, he would
[01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:01.000]  run just to keep
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.400]  in shape. So, uh,
[01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:04.200]  that's, you know,
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:05.200]  like I said, it wasn't
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:06.500]  that he was obese
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:07.800]  or out of shape.
[01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:09.100]  He was dedicated
[01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:09.900]  to the sport.
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:12.500]  And he was in good
[01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:13.200]  shape. He was in
[01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:15.200]  good shape. Yes,
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:16.700]  sir. Yes, sir. He
[01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:17.700]  would eat healthy.
[01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:18.400]  He wouldn't drink
[01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:19.300]  Cokes. We're always
[01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:20.500]  drinking water or
[01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:21.400]  iced tea, you know,
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:22.700]  but mainly water.
[01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:24.100]  And he always
[01:15:24.100 --> 01:15:24.700]  wanted to stay in
[01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:25.900]  shape for the sport
[01:15:25.900 --> 01:15:26.800]  he loved so much.
[01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:27.900]  And if he wasn't
[01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:28.800]  playing baseball, he
[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:29.500]  was out here playing
[01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:30.600]  basketball with his
[01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:31.400]  friends here in the
[01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:33.000]  neighborhood. And
[01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:35.900]  that's why, uh, they
[01:15:35.900 --> 01:15:36.800]  they're trying to,
[01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:37.600]  they were trying to
[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:38.600]  tell me that, oh, it
[01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:39.300]  had to be a
[01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:40.700]  preexisting condition.
[01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:42.200]  I said, no, I mean,
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:43.100]  my son has never
[01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:43.800]  really ever been
[01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:45.200]  sick other than the
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:45.500]  snap.
[01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:46.200]  Well, let's do this
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:46.700]  cause there's a
[01:15:46.700 --> 01:15:47.600]  standard cover-up
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:48.200]  they do now and
[01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:48.900]  shame on them.
[01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:49.600]  I know it's hard
[01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:50.000]  for you to talk
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.000]  about, but describe
[01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:51.900]  what happened, go
[01:15:51.900 --> 01:15:52.600]  back to that day,
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:53.200]  what you learned,
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:53.600]  what they said at
[01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:54.100]  the hospital.
[01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:54.500]  Describe what
[01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:54.800]  happened to your
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:55.100]  son.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.100]  Well, when I arrived
[01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:00.400]  at the park, he
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:01.400]  was in the ambulance
[01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:02.600]  and, uh, they
[01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:03.300]  were working on
[01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:05.400]  him. I mean, I
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:06.200]  was screaming,
[01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:07.900]  yelling for him,
[01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:10.700]  trying to get hoping
[01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:11.600]  he would get up,
[01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:12.700]  you know, knowing
[01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:13.300]  that I was there
[01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:14.800]  with him. Then
[01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:15.500]  when we arrived
[01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:16.400]  at the hospital,
[01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:18.700]  I was looking
[01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:19.200]  through the door
[01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:19.500]  and they were
[01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:20.500]  still constantly
[01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:21.200]  working on him.
[01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:23.200]  And like I said
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:24.400]  before, the doctor
[01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:25.400]  just came out like,
[01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:26.200]  you know, like
[01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:27.100]  nothing, it meant
[01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:28.000]  nothing to them.
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:28.500]  You know, your
[01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:29.100]  son's dead.
[01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:29.700]  You can go home
[01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:32.600]  now. So, I mean,
[01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:34.000]  that's what a
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:34.800]  child's life is
[01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:35.500]  worth to you.
[01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:37.900]  Just some dead
[01:16:37.900 --> 01:16:39.400]  blank words, you
[01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:40.400]  know, to go home,
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:41.000]  you know, like
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:41.800]  nothing, it meant
[01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:42.500]  nothing to me.
[01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:45.100]  They, uh, like
[01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:45.500]  I said, they
[01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:46.100]  tried to cover it
[01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:47.300]  up also. I mean,
[01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:48.800]  I have videos of
[01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:49.600]  where the doctor
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:50.500]  trying to come
[01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:51.400]  up with excuses
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:52.700]  saying it was a
[01:16:52.700 --> 01:16:54.100]  pre-existing condition
[01:16:54.100 --> 01:16:54.900]  or he wasn't
[01:16:54.900 --> 01:16:55.800]  vaccinated at his
[01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:57.100]  hospital or that
[01:16:57.100 --> 01:16:57.900]  he, uh, he
[01:16:57.900 --> 01:16:58.700]  had said nobody
[01:16:58.700 --> 01:16:59.600]  had passed away
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:00.900]  that day. But
[01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:01.900]  then when she
[01:17:01.900 --> 01:17:02.500]  showed him the
[01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:04.300]  death certificate
[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:05.700]  and paperwork, he
[01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:06.300]  said, oh, he
[01:17:06.300 --> 01:17:06.800]  must have, he
[01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:07.700]  was, if that's
[01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:08.300]  the same child,
[01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:09.800]  he was obese and
[01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:10.300]  he was showed
[01:17:10.300 --> 01:17:11.100]  the photo also.
[01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:11.600]  And he goes, oh,
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:12.200]  he's a normal
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:13.200]  16 year old kid.
[01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:14.100]  I said, they
[01:17:14.100 --> 01:17:15.000]  kept trying to
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.100]  make excuses
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:18.000]  because he was
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:18.600]  vaccinated at
[01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:19.400]  the hospital,
[01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:20.300]  the doctor
[01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:21.000]  was in charge of
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.200]  them. Like
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:22.800]  I said, they
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:23.500]  were just trying
[01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:24.300]  to twist it
[01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:25.300]  out of shape.
[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:26.600]  They've, they've
[01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:27.400]  offered me 10 to
[01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:28.600]  $35,000 to
[01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:29.200]  change his death
[01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:30.500]  certificate. I've
[01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:31.600]  had incidents
[01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:32.100]  that have
[01:17:32.100 --> 01:17:33.200]  happened while
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:33.600]  I was at the
[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:34.200]  airport getting
[01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:34.800]  ready to fly
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:35.700]  to DC where
[01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:36.500]  they came up
[01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:38.800]  to me. I
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:39.600]  had a text
[01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:40.100]  telling me that
[01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:40.900]  Biden had landed
[01:17:40.900 --> 01:17:42.200]  here and I
[01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:42.700]  said, thank
[01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:43.100]  you, but I'm
[01:17:43.100 --> 01:17:43.600]  on the flight
[01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:44.800]  to DC and they
[01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:45.600]  actually stopped
[01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:46.500]  the plane. You
[01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:47.400]  know, you know,
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:48.200]  of all people,
[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:49.100]  once the doors
[01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:49.600]  are closed, they
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:50.200]  don't open them
[01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:51.400]  up. Well, they
[01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:51.800]  stopped the
[01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:52.600]  plane, reopen
[01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:53.100]  the doors, it
[01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:53.600]  came to my
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:55.100]  seat and asked,
[01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:55.600]  is your name
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:56.100]  Ernest? I
[01:17:56.100 --> 01:17:57.100]  said, yes. They
[01:17:57.100 --> 01:17:57.400]  got on the
[01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:58.000]  radio and said,
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:17:58.700]  Ernest Ramirez
[01:17:58.700 --> 01:17:59.000]  is on the
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:00.500]  plane. And
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:01.500]  so they must
[01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:01.700]  have been
[01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:02.800]  watching my
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:03.800]  phone, the
[01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:04.700]  text message I
[01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:05.400]  was receiving.
[01:18:06.100 --> 01:18:06.800]  I've had places
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:07.600]  where we, me
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:08.500]  and a lot of
[01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:09.300]  other people
[01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:10.000]  were at, you
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:10.500]  know, we were
[01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:11.600]  speaking at an
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:13.000]  event and
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:13.500]  they raided the
[01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:14.200]  place thinking
[01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:14.700]  I was there
[01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:15.100]  because I
[01:18:15.100 --> 01:18:15.700]  backed out at
[01:18:15.700 --> 01:18:16.400]  the last minute
[01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:17.400]  and the
[01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:18.100]  police raided
[01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:19.200]  the place and
[01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:20.200]  you know, I
[01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:20.900]  know and I
[01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:21.400]  told people
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:21.900]  this years
[01:18:21.900 --> 01:18:22.400]  ago. It's
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:23.300]  the CIA.
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:23.900]  It's there
[01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:24.700]  everywhere
[01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:25.500]  when they
[01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:25.900]  work through
[01:18:25.900 --> 01:18:26.200]  all their
[01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:26.800]  operatives and
[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:28.000]  minions and
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:28.500]  they're scared
[01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:29.000]  of you and
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:29.200]  they're
[01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:29.900]  harassing you
[01:18:29.900 --> 01:18:30.200]  and that's
[01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:30.400]  what they
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:31.400]  do and
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:31.700]  they're here
[01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:32.200]  to carry out
[01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:32.700]  the murder.
[01:18:32.700 --> 01:18:32.900]  They're
[01:18:32.900 --> 01:18:33.100]  here to
[01:18:33.100 --> 01:18:33.800]  carry out the
[01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:34.600]  murder of
[01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:35.100]  the American

[01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:43.800]  cabinet
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:44.500]  literally
[01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:45.300]  prosecuting
[01:18:45.300 --> 01:18:46.000]  this war
[01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:47.000]  to
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:47.700]  depopulate
[01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:48.600]  us because
[01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:48.800]  they don't
[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:49.000]  want the
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:49.300]  rest of the
[01:18:49.300 --> 01:18:49.600]  world to
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:49.800]  see an

[01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:50.700]  country.
[01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:51.100]  We are
[01:18:51.100 --> 01:18:51.600]  slated for
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:52.300]  destruction
[01:18:52.700 --> 01:18:52.900]  and your
[01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:53.200]  son was
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:53.900]  a casualty
[01:18:53.900 --> 01:18:54.100]  of a
[01:18:54.100 --> 01:18:54.800]  chemical
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:55.700]  biological

[01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:58.800]  and and
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:18:59.200]  and that's
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:18:59.700]  the reality.
[01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:00.000]  We have
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:00.200]  to
[01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:01.200]  face it and
[01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:01.600]  understand
[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:01.700]  it and
[01:19:01.700 --> 01:19:02.000]  we're not
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:02.200]  going to
[01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:02.500]  let the

[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:07.200]  their
[01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:07.800]  billboards
[01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:08.400]  saying don't

[01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:11.900]  is good.
[01:19:12.100 --> 01:19:12.600]  No,
[01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:13.600]  no, no, no,

[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:15.900]  of you globalist.
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:16.400]  You need to
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:17.300]  go first show
[01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:18.000]  us how you're
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:18.400]  supposed to
[01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:18.800]  do it.
[01:19:18.900 --> 01:19:19.200]  Then I'll
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:19.800]  actually listen
[01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:20.200]  to you.
[01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:21.200]  No, no, they
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:21.600]  want the
[01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:22.000]  world for
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.100]  themselves and
[01:19:23.100 --> 01:19:23.600]  your son was
[01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:24.500]  a casualty
[01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:25.800]  of a modern
[01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:26.800]  World War 3
[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:27.400]  launched by
[01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:28.600]  the UN and
[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:30.100]  the Bill Gates
[01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:31.700]  WEF against
[01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:32.100]  you and
[01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:32.600]  your family
[01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:32.800]  and my
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:33.300]  family.
[01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:35.000]  Yes, sir.
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:35.600]  Exactly.
[01:19:35.700 --> 01:19:36.000]  That's what
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:36.400]  I said.
[01:19:37.100 --> 01:19:37.500]  They
[01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:38.000]  they don't
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:38.500]  scare me.
[01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:39.200]  I've invited
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:39.700]  them on
[01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:40.100]  video.
[01:19:40.100 --> 01:19:40.600]  I've had
[01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:41.100]  posted
[01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:41.400]  several
[01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:42.100]  platforms.
[01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:43.000]  I invite
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:43.200]  them to
[01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:43.500]  come to
[01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:44.000]  me face
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:44.500]  to face
[01:19:44.500 --> 01:19:45.100]  be mad
[01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:45.700]  be a man.
[01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:46.000]  If you
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:46.300]  want to
[01:19:46.300 --> 01:19:47.000]  do something
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:47.300]  now, they're
[01:19:47.300 --> 01:19:47.800]  not man.
[01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:48.200]  They creep
[01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:48.500]  around in
[01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:49.200]  the dark and
[01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:49.700]  they shoot
[01:19:49.700 --> 01:19:50.000]  up our
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:50.400]  kids and
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:50.800]  kill them.
[01:19:50.900 --> 01:19:51.100]  They think
[01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:51.300]  it's
[01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:51.800]  funny.
[01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:52.400]  Yes, sir.
[01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:53.600]  Yes, sir.
[01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:54.200]  Exactly.
[01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:54.500]  And that's
[01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:54.800]  why I
[01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:55.100]  don't know
[01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:55.900]  we got
[01:19:55.900 --> 01:19:56.400]  have to do
[01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:56.700]  something
[01:19:56.700 --> 01:19:57.000]  else.
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:57.500]  I have to
[01:19:57.500 --> 01:19:58.100]  do more.
[01:19:59.500 --> 01:19:59.800]  I feel
[01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:00.100]  like what
[01:20:00.100 --> 01:20:00.500]  I'm doing
[01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:00.900]  is not
[01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:01.300]  enough.
[01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:01.700]  I
[01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:03.100]  I need
[01:20:03.100 --> 01:20:03.600]  to wrap
[01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:03.800]  some
[01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:04.600]  more cages.
[01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:05.300]  I need
[01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:05.600]  to piss
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:06.200]  them off.
[01:20:06.300 --> 01:20:06.600]  I know
[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:07.200]  I'm a thorn
[01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:07.700]  right now
[01:20:07.700 --> 01:20:08.300]  underside,
[01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:09.000]  but I
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:09.300]  want to
[01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:10.000]  be more.
[01:20:10.100 --> 01:20:10.400]  I want
[01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:10.800]  them to
[01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:11.400]  actually
[01:20:12.100 --> 01:20:12.600]  have fear
[01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:12.900]  when they
[01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:13.100]  see me
[01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:13.500]  walk into
[01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:14.000]  a room.
[01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:14.600]  They
[01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:15.100]  knew it
[01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:15.900]  because
[01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:16.500]  don't worry.
[01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:17.200]  Don't worry.
[01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:17.600]  No
[01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:17.900]  worry.
[01:20:17.900 --> 01:20:18.500]  Ernest
[01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:19.200]  senior
[01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:20.100]  Bill
[01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:20.600]  Gates and
[01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:20.900]  Fouts.
[01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:21.100]  You're
[01:20:21.100 --> 01:20:21.500]  scared
[01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:21.900]  now.
[01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:22.300]  Don't
[01:20:22.300 --> 01:20:22.800]  you worry.
[01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:25.100]  Yeah, but
[01:20:25.100 --> 01:20:25.400]  we need
[01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:25.800]  to
[01:20:26.100 --> 01:20:26.400]  have this
[01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:26.600]  all
[01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:26.900]  to come
[01:20:26.900 --> 01:20:27.100]  to an
[01:20:27.100 --> 01:20:27.900]  end before
[01:20:27.900 --> 01:20:28.300]  it gets
[01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:28.800]  worse
[01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:29.400]  because
[01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:29.900]  I'm
[01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:30.700]  I'm

[01:20:31.100 --> 01:20:31.300]  getting
[01:20:31.300 --> 01:20:31.800]  messages
[01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:32.100]  still
[01:20:32.300 --> 01:20:32.500]  in the
[01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:32.700]  middle
[01:20:32.700 --> 01:20:32.900]  of the
[01:20:32.900 --> 01:20:33.300]  night
[01:20:33.300 --> 01:20:33.800]  earnest.
[01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:34.200]  Please.
[01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:34.500]  This
[01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:34.800]  happened
[01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:35.200]  here.
[01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:35.900]  My
[01:20:35.900 --> 01:20:36.300]  son,

[01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:37.100]  friend's
[01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:37.900]  child.
[01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:38.700]  You know, and
[01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:39.100]  it's
[01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:39.600]  it's
[01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:40.200]  overwhelming
[01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:40.500]  for me
[01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:41.100]  because
[01:20:41.700 --> 01:20:41.900]  I
[01:20:41.900 --> 01:20:42.400]  wish
[01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:42.800]  I was
[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:43.000]  in the
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:43.500]  position
[01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:43.700]  where
[01:20:43.700 --> 01:20:44.000]  I could
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:44.200]  do
[01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:44.800]  more
[01:20:44.900 --> 01:20:45.300]  and
[01:20:45.300 --> 01:20:45.800]  help
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:46.600]  people.
[01:20:46.900 --> 01:20:47.200]  You know,
[01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:47.300]  I'm
[01:20:47.300 --> 01:20:47.700]  here.
[01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:47.900]  I'll
[01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:48.000]  do
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:48.200]  as
[01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:48.400]  much
[01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:48.500]  as
[01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:48.600]  I
[01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:49.000]  can
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:49.200]  for
[01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:49.300]  as
[01:20:49.300 --> 01:20:49.500]  long
[01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:49.600]  as
[01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:49.700]  I
[01:20:49.700 --> 01:20:50.000]  can,
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:50.300]  but
[01:20:51.300 --> 01:20:51.900]  I
[01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:52.200]  wish
[01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:52.300]  I
[01:20:52.300 --> 01:20:52.600]  was
[01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:52.800]  in
[01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:53.500]  politics
[01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:53.800]  so
[01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:53.900]  I
[01:20:53.900 --> 01:20:54.000]  can
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:54.200]  make
[01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:54.700]  laws
[01:20:54.700 --> 01:20:54.800]  or
[01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:55.000]  so
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:55.100]  I
[01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:55.400]  can
[01:20:55.900 --> 01:20:56.200]  try
[01:20:56.200 --> 01:20:56.300]  to
[01:20:56.300 --> 01:20:56.700]  stop
[01:20:56.700 --> 01:20:56.800]  and
[01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:57.300]  prevent
[01:20:57.300 --> 01:20:58.800]  from
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:20:59.300]  being
[01:20:59.300 --> 01:20:59.700]  affected
[01:20:59.700 --> 01:20:59.800]  by
[01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:00.100]  this
[01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:00.600]  poison
[01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:01.700]  because
[01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:02.000]  we
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:02.200]  don't
[01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:02.600]  deserve
[01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:02.900]  this.
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:03.200]  No
[01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:03.500]  one
[01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:04.300]  does.
[01:21:04.300 --> 01:21:04.600]  I mean,
[01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:04.800]  I don't
[01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:05.100]  wish
[01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:05.300]  what
[01:21:05.300 --> 01:21:05.600]  happened
[01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:05.700]  to
[01:21:05.700 --> 01:21:06.000]  be
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:06.200]  on
[01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:06.700]  anyone
[01:21:06.700 --> 01:21:07.200]  because
[01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:08.700]  it's
[01:21:08.700 --> 01:21:09.400]  torture
[01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:09.800]  every
[01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:10.100]  morning
[01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:10.300]  when
[01:21:10.300 --> 01:21:10.400]  I
[01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:10.600]  wake
[01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:10.900]  up
[01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:11.600]  and
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:12.100]  you
[01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:12.300]  know,
[01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:12.500]  it's
[01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:13.100]  tiring.
[01:21:14.900 --> 01:21:15.300]  It's
[01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:16.100]  exhausting,
[01:21:16.100 --> 01:21:16.500]  but
[01:21:17.300 --> 01:21:17.600]  it's
[01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:17.900]  something
[01:21:17.900 --> 01:21:18.000]  I
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:18.200]  know
[01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:18.300]  I
[01:21:18.300 --> 01:21:18.400]  have
[01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:18.500]  to
[01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:18.800]  do.
[01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:19.000]  Well,
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:19.200]  you're
[01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:19.600]  saving
[01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:19.700]  a
[01:21:19.700 --> 01:21:20.000]  lot of
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:20.600]  children
[01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:20.800]  and
[01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:21.200]  people.
[01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:21.400]  That's
[01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:21.500]  why
[01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:21.700]  they're
[01:21:21.700 --> 01:21:22.000]  pissed
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:22.200]  at
[01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:22.500]  you.
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:23.100]  Believe
[01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:23.300]  me,
[01:21:23.300 --> 01:21:23.600]  Ernest,
[01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:23.700]  you
[01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:24.000]  probably
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:24.400]  saved
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:24.600]  hundreds
[01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:24.700]  of
[01:21:24.700 --> 01:21:25.000]  thousands
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:25.100]  of
[01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:25.400]  lives
[01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:25.600]  around
[01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:25.700]  the
[01:21:25.700 --> 01:21:26.100]  world
[01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:26.900]  by
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:27.300]  coming
[01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:27.500]  out.
[01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:28.000]  Most people,
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:28.200]  when they
[01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:28.500]  kill
[01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:28.900]  somebody's
[01:21:28.900 --> 01:21:29.300]  child,
[01:21:29.300 --> 01:21:29.400]  they
[01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:29.600]  get
[01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:29.900]  scared.
[01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:30.000]  They
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:30.200]  roll
[01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:30.600]  over.
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:31.200]  I've

[01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:32.800]  know,
[01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:32.900]  who

[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:33.200]  their
[01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:33.500]  family
[01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:34.000]  murdered.
[01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:34.400]  And
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:34.700]  most of
[01:21:34.700 --> 01:21:34.800]  them
[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:35.000]  aren't
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:35.100]  like
[01:21:35.100 --> 01:21:35.400]  Robert
[01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:35.900]  Kennedy,

[01:21:36.900 --> 01:21:37.200]  speak
[01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:37.500]  up.
[01:21:37.900 --> 01:21:38.200]  Most
[01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:38.300]  of
[01:21:38.300 --> 01:21:38.400]  them
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:38.500]  are
[01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:38.700]  just
[01:21:38.700 --> 01:21:39.100]  scared
[01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:39.200]  because
[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:39.300]  the
[01:21:39.300 --> 01:21:39.600]  FBI
[01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:40.100]  threatens
[01:21:40.100 --> 01:21:40.200]  them
[01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:40.300]  and
[01:21:40.300 --> 01:21:40.700]  things.
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:41.100]  And
[01:21:41.100 --> 01:21:41.300]  I'm
[01:21:41.300 --> 01:21:41.500]  talking
[01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:41.900]  about,
[01:21:42.700 --> 01:21:42.800]  I'm
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:43.000]  talking
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:43.200]  about
[01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:43.500]  John
[01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:43.900]  Lennon's
[01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:44.300]  family.
[01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:44.400]  You
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:44.600]  name

[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:45.100]  I'm
[01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:45.200]  gonna leave
[01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:45.400]  it at
[01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:45.700]  that.
[01:21:46.100 --> 01:21:46.300]  So I've
[01:21:46.300 --> 01:21:46.500]  been told
[01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:46.900]  this stuff
[01:21:46.900 --> 01:21:47.000]  in
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:47.400]  confidence,
[01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:47.700]  but
[01:21:47.900 --> 01:21:48.100]  it's
[01:21:48.100 --> 01:21:48.500]  bad,
[01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:48.700]  but
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:49.100]  at

[01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:49.400]  certain
[01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:49.700]  point,
[01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:49.900]  like

[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:50.200]  done,
[01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:50.300]  you've
[01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:50.400]  got to
[01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:50.800]  realize
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:51.100]  they're
[01:21:51.100 --> 01:21:51.200]  going

[01:21:51.700 --> 01:21:52.000]  anyways,
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:52.100]  and
[01:21:52.100 --> 01:21:52.200]  we
[01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:52.400]  don't
[01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:52.600]  beat
[01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:52.700]  them.
[01:21:52.700 --> 01:21:52.800]  We

[01:21:53.300 --> 01:21:53.600]  after
[01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:54.000]  them.

[01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:55.000]  expose
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:55.400]  them
[01:21:55.700 --> 01:21:56.100]  and
[01:21:56.100 --> 01:21:56.300]  and
[01:21:56.300 --> 01:21:56.500]  then
[01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:56.900]  just
[01:21:57.100 --> 01:21:57.400]  fine.

[01:22:31.100 --> 01:22:31.300]  you
[01:22:31.300 --> 01:22:31.500]  were
[01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:32.000]  right
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:32.400]  or
[01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:32.700]  just

[01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:33.400]  alone.
[01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:33.600]  That's

[01:22:37.100 --> 01:22:37.400]  come
[01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:37.500]  and
[01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:37.600]  we're
[01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:37.800]  one.
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:38.200]  They

[01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:43.700]  the
[01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:43.900]  shot.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:44.100]  You're

[01:22:44.700 --> 01:22:45.200]  do it
[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:45.500]  because
[01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:45.700]  you
[01:22:45.700 --> 01:22:46.000]  didn't

[01:22:48.900 --> 01:22:49.100]  and
[01:22:49.100 --> 01:22:49.300]  so

[01:22:51.100 --> 01:22:51.300]  think
[01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:51.400]  of

[01:22:59.600 --> 01:22:59.700]  It
[01:22:59.700 --> 01:22:59.900]  was
[01:22:59.900 --> 01:23:00.500]  wonderful.
[01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:00.700]  I
[01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:01.000]  mean,

[01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:04.100]  throughout
[01:23:04.100 --> 01:23:04.200]  these
[01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:04.400]  two
[01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:04.800]  years,

[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:05.100]  the
[01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:05.300]  stuff
[01:23:05.300 --> 01:23:05.500]  I've

[01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:06.500]  heard
[01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:07.000]  and
[01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:08.400]  I've
[01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:08.600]  got

[01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:09.600]  film,
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:10.300]  even
[01:23:10.300 --> 01:23:10.500]  that
[01:23:10.500 --> 01:23:10.800]  night
[01:23:11.300 --> 01:23:11.500]  a
[01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:11.800]  lot
[01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:12.100]  more.
[01:23:12.500 --> 01:23:12.600]  Me
[01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:12.700]  and
[01:23:12.700 --> 01:23:13.100]  Jessica
[01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:13.200]  were
[01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:13.500]  there
[01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:13.700]  and

[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:17.200]  and
[01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:17.400]  that's
[01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:17.700]  because
[01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:17.900]  we're
[01:23:17.900 --> 01:23:18.000]  in

[01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:21.200]  that
[01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:21.400]  the
[01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:21.700]  average
[01:23:21.700 --> 01:23:22.200]  person,
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:22.300]  they

[01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:22.600]  their
[01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:22.800]  eyes
[01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:23.100]  closed.
[01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:23.200]  They
[01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:23.300]  don't
[01:23:23.300 --> 01:23:23.600]  see
[01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:23.800]  it.
[01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:24.900]  We
[01:23:24.900 --> 01:23:25.100]  that

[01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:25.700]  what's
[01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:26.000]  going
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:26.400]  on.
[01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:27.100]  We
[01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:27.300]  were
[01:23:27.300 --> 01:23:27.800]  amazed
[01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:28.000]  at
[01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:28.500]  all

[01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:31.800]  waiting

[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:32.100]  I
[01:23:32.100 --> 01:23:32.300]  can't
[01:23:32.300 --> 01:23:32.500]  wait
[01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:32.700]  for

[01:23:34.700 --> 01:23:34.800]  or
[01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:35.100]  two.
[01:23:35.300 --> 01:23:36.000]  Absolutely.
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:36.200]  Well,
[01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:36.300]  the

[01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:40.700]  It's
[01:23:40.700 --> 01:23:40.900]  not

[01:23:49.100 --> 01:23:49.200]  hear
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:49.400]  that
[01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:49.900]  anymore
[01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:50.400]  and
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:51.100]  we
[01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:51.300]  did
[01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:51.700]  set
[01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:52.000]  stand
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:52.300]  up
[01:23:52.300 --> 01:23:52.800]  and
[01:23:52.900 --> 01:23:53.500]  cry
[01:23:54.100 --> 01:23:54.200]  to
[01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:54.500]  actually
[01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:54.800]  hear
[01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:55.700]  song
[01:23:56.100 --> 01:23:56.700]  because
[01:23:57.200 --> 01:23:57.500]  that's
[01:23:57.500 --> 01:23:57.600]  what
[01:23:57.600 --> 01:23:57.800]  we
[01:23:57.800 --> 01:23:58.100]  like
[01:23:58.100 --> 01:23:58.200]  in
[01:23:58.200 --> 01:23:58.400]  this
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:23:58.800]  world.
[01:23:59.300 --> 01:23:59.500]  We
[01:23:59.500 --> 01:23:59.800]  need
[01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:00.800]  to
[01:24:01.100 --> 01:24:01.600]  respect
[01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:01.700]  our
[01:24:01.700 --> 01:24:02.200]  country
[01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:02.700]  respect
[01:24:02.700 --> 01:24:02.800]  our
[01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:03.200]  flag
[01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:04.500]  and
[01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:04.800]  people
[01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:05.200]  lost
[01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:05.300]  that
[01:24:05.300 --> 01:24:05.800]  already.
[01:24:05.900 --> 01:24:06.000]  We
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:06.200]  need
[01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:06.300]  to
[01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:06.400]  get
[01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:06.600]  that
[01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:06.800]  back
[01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:07.200]  again.
[01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:14.120]  Absolutely, brother. But you said the most important thing about 10 minutes ago. They're
[01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:18.599]  getting ready to do it again. It's not just about bringing the criminals to justice. It's
[01:24:18.599 --> 01:24:22.840]  not just about justice for your son. It's about saving those that haven't been hit yet.
[01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:26.360]  And they're trying to literally set up camps and forced injection. And they have this
[01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:30.480]  healing world tree to take over our bodies. I mean, this is outrageous. That's why
[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:33.880]  I get chills. That's why I get tears in my eyes. And part of the tears in my
[01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:37.960]  eyes earn us her empathy because your son was a beautiful person. His soul lives on forever.
[01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:41.719]  But I have four children. I have a son. I have three daughters. I have a six year old daughter.
[01:24:41.719 --> 01:24:45.080]  And every time I look at her, I think about what they're doing, how they're targeting her.
[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:49.080]  And it fundamentally makes me mad because they'd love it to be her too, brother.
[01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:52.679]  And it just makes me know we can't let them win. We won't let them win.
[01:24:53.639 --> 01:25:01.240]  No, no, no, sir. We can't. We have to fight. Everyone needs to stand up and fight.
[01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:08.840]  I mean, don't just expect me here, any of my friends and what section of the area they're in.
[01:25:09.559 --> 01:25:15.799]  Each individual in your own local place stand up, make a difference, yell, scream,
[01:25:16.679 --> 01:25:21.320]  make signs, make your own decals. You know, it doesn't have to cover your whole car,
[01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:26.840]  put a bumper sticker or something, make you some shirts, you know, just to keep it out there
[01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:31.240]  in the public eye. You know, we need to have people start questioning things, you know,
[01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:34.679]  well, what's your shirt? They'll come up to me and say, what's that shirt for?
[01:25:34.679 --> 01:25:40.519]  Or what's the other one for? And that opens the door to have the conversation, you know.
[01:25:40.519 --> 01:25:44.679]  By the way, I should have said React 19, because I've got your old bio here,
[01:25:44.679 --> 01:25:48.280]  juniorsguardianvoice.com. What's the best website to get out, Ernest?
[01:25:49.719 --> 01:25:55.480]  React 19, you can go to react19.org. Contact any one of us there.
[01:25:57.160 --> 01:26:05.559]  Also, my son's website, juniorsguardianvoice.com. And my life wonder is justice for Ernesto on
[01:26:05.559 --> 01:26:12.040]  life wonder. My phone's on 24 sevens. I've given out my personal number to everyone I walk
[01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:17.960]  up to. I'll also ask them, if you know somebody that's injured or you yourself or
[01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:23.639]  your family members, contact me, please. I don't. And that includes LeBron James.
[01:26:23.639 --> 01:26:32.040]  LeBron James has a chance to be a hero here. And so does his son. So react19.org, react19.org.
[01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:37.880]  Yeah, I wish I would really appreciate if he did contact me just to talk one on one.
[01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:41.559]  He doesn't have to worry about cameras or radio tape because I'm not that big of a person.
[01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:46.759]  I just want to speak to him and, you know, to give him some more information about what's
[01:26:46.759 --> 01:26:51.719]  going on so he can understand and try to realize that keeping quiet doesn't do nothing.
[01:26:51.719 --> 01:26:55.160]  Now, by the way, none of his doctors, none of his doctors are going to tell him that he
[01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:59.000]  needs to purify the blood. There's a whole bunch of natural compounds to do. They're not going to
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:03.160]  tell him that stuff keeps growing. I mean, imagine how the doctors are going to try to
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:09.480]  have to spin to LeBron James, why his perfectly healthy young son just had a massive heart
[01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:17.000]  attack and had to be resuscitated. I mean, actually, we have a ticking time bomb inside
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:21.719]  us. We just don't know when it's going to explode. That's the thing. I mean, I've been
[01:27:22.759 --> 01:27:28.840]  asked by these doctors, all the doctors I know, to start treatment, but I don't have time. I need
[01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:34.360]  to continue doing this because who knows if I'll be here tomorrow. So I need to do as much as I
[01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:41.400]  can today because that's something I feel I need to do. You know, I have to fulfill my position
[01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:47.240]  that the good Lord put me in. So I know I can go rest with ease on my heart and my mind that
[01:27:47.799 --> 01:27:53.400]  I did my best. So we all need to do that. So if he's listening or if he wants you to show
[01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:58.759]  you got my number, contact Alex and he'll give you my personal number. You can call me.
[01:27:58.759 --> 01:28:04.840]  Absolutely. Or people can go to, again, the best website for you is react19.org.
[01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:29.240]  And I love my son. I love all my family, my vaccine injured family. I'll always be here for you.
[01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:34.360]  And you're more than welcome to contact me 24 7. Like I said, thank you again.
[01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:39.719]  I appreciate you. Take action now react19.org. Thank you, Ernest. God bless you.
[01:28:40.759 --> 01:28:44.200]  Thank you, sir. Your son murdered by the new world order,

[01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:43.760]  Dr. Mercola, thank you
[01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:46.760]  Well, there's no way to precisely predict it
[01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:50.760]  We can get a hint and a suggestion of where it's going
[01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:52.760]  Certainly, from what they've done
[01:36:52.760 --> 01:36:54.760]  Clearly, the last three years
[01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:56.760]  Well, we're in a lull now, of course
[01:36:56.760 --> 01:36:58.760]  It feels great
[01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:01.760]  The last three years, the lockdowns and the vaccine mandates
[01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:04.760]  Not being able to fly and restrictions and masks
[01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:06.760]  All these headaches
[01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:10.760]  And they showed us during this period how effective they are
[01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:12.760]  This is a trial run
[01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:14.760]  This was not the main gain
[01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:16.760]  This was practice
[01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:18.760]  And they're fine-tuning their program
[01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:21.760]  It seems pretty clear to me
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:24.760]  And it's obvious that they're going to launch
[01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:28.760]  An even worse crisis in the future
[01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:29.760]  It's inevitable
[01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:30.760]  Now, when will that be?
[01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:31.760]  No one knows
[01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:33.760]  It's unlikely to be in the very near future
[01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:36.760]  So I don't think it'll happen before next year
[01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:37.760]  Although it could
[01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:38.760]  It's unlikely
[01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:40.760]  Probably next year, even 2025 more than likely
[01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:42.760]  But a crisis is inevitable
[01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:43.760]  So we've got to prepare
[01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:48.760]  We've got to recognize that we may lose most of the resources
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:49.760]  Look what happened last time
[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:50.760]  They had the lockdowns
[01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:52.760]  They had the supply chain challenges
[01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:55.760]  And grocery stores were empty
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:59.760]  So we have to know how to prepare to store our own food
[01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:04.760]  And to essentially have basic survival skills
[01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:06.760]  To prepare for the next one
[01:38:06.760 --> 01:38:10.760]  I was a boy scout when I was a youngster
[01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:12.760]  And that was literally one of the best things I ever did
[01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:14.760]  I grew up in the inner city
[01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:17.760]  And didn't really have access to nature and such
[01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:19.760]  But the boy scouts allowed me to go out there
[01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:20.760]  And learn some basic skills
[01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:21.760]  And their motto
[01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:23.760]  Their motto is to be prepared
[01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:25.760]  And I've adopted that motto for most of my life
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:26.760]  And it's served me well
[01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:30.760]  And I would encourage everyone to consider being prepared
[01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:31.760]  Doctor, what is the best website?
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:36.760]  You've got so many for people to find all your resources
[01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:41.760]  Well, my primary website is my last name Mercola
[01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:44.760]  M-E-R-C-O-L-A dot com
[01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:47.760]  I've been up, had that site since 1997
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:49.760]  Before Google had their site
[01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:54.760]  And we've been the most visited website in the world for natural health
[01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:56.760]  Despite all the censorship
[01:38:56.760 --> 01:38:59.760]  But we also have a substack
[01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:03.760]  Because just about short of two years ago now
[01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:06.760]  I was on your show right after this happened
[01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:08.760]  I received some threats from myself
[01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:10.760]  My family and my business
[01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:14.760]  So I was really forced to remove the
[01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:18.760]  15, 20 years of articles that we had up at the time
[01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:20.760]  And removed them from the site
[01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:22.760]  So we don't have much content on our site
[01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:25.760]  We do have the last two days
[01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:27.760]  The current day and the day before
[01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:29.760]  Of the current articles
[01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:32.760]  And then they're transferred to the security of substack
[01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:34.760]  So that has served
[01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:35.760]  For those who don't know
[01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:36.760]  I know the inside of baseball
[01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:38.760]  Because they sent people to harass you
[01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:39.760]  They sent people to your house
[01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:40.760]  It just happened to me
[01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:42.760]  I don't think the average listener realizes
[01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:43.760]  Because we're not wimps
[01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:45.760]  I'm not saying we're tough guys
[01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:46.760]  But we don't make a big deal about it
[01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:48.760]  But the level of harassment
[01:39:48.760 --> 01:39:51.760]  CIA, Justice Department, think tanks, NGOs
[01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:52.760]  Is insane
[01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:54.760]  But I think it was refreshing the last few months
[01:39:54.760 --> 01:39:56.760]  To see congressional hearings admitting
[01:39:56.760 --> 01:39:58.760]  That there's been this weaponization
[01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:00.760]  Against the resistance
[01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:02.760]  But I think they're not doing it because they're strong
[01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:04.760]  They're attacking us because they're weak
[01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:05.760]  And what you said is so critical
[01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:07.760]  The U.N., the globalists
[01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:09.760]  They're passing these treaties
[01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:11.760]  They've set up a permanent pandemic office
[01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:13.760]  In the federal government
[01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:14.760]  An agency
[01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:16.760]  This is their holy grail
[01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:17.760]  Their blueprint of control
[01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:19.760]  And I totally agree with you
[01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:21.760]  And they try to get it from finances too
[01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:24.760]  So we have multiple banks that we have relationships with
[01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:26.760]  And they took our primary bank out two years ago
[01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:28.760]  They just canceled us
[01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:29.760]  In the middle of the pandemic
[01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:30.760]  And that was obvious
[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:33.760]  Because I was the number one source of misinformation
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:34.760]  According to the White House
[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:35.760]  Here's the article
[01:40:35.760 --> 01:40:36.760]  Talk about that
[01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:39.760]  You were listed along with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:40.760]  And ten other people
[01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:41.760]  As the number one enemy
[01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:43.760]  You were number one on the list
[01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:44.760]  That's like John Hancock
[01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:46.760]  Bobby was number two
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:48.760]  Only because he hasn't been doing this
[01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:49.760]  As long as I have
[01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:51.760]  It's not that he's inferior in any way, shape, or form
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:53.760]  He's a magnificent communicator
[01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:54.760]  And really understands what's going on
[01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:56.760]  So I wish him the best
[01:40:56.760 --> 01:40:58.760]  But isn't this like John Hancock?
[01:40:58.760 --> 01:40:59.760]  Are you not
[01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:00.760]  I know you're a prideful person
[01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:01.760]  You're very humble
[01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:02.760]  But are you not satisfied that
[01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:05.760]  The bad guy you Genesis murderers
[01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:06.760]  Say you're number one
[01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:08.760]  I mean, that's like John Hancock
[01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:09.760]  Yeah
[01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:11.760]  Yeah, it was literally and still is
[01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:13.760]  The greatest honor I've ever received
[01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:14.760]  In my professional career
[01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:16.760]  Nothing, nothing even comes close
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:19.760]  To be recognized by the global cabal
[01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:22.760]  As the leader is like, wow
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:25.760]  Now, interestingly, that was misinformation for sure
[01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:27.760]  Because it wasn't really accurate
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:28.760]  But it was their perception
[01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:30.760]  I mean, they felt the need to display that
[01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:31.760]  Because by no way, shape, or form
[01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:32.760]  Did I have the reach
[01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:34.760]  I have a fraction of the reach that you do
[01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:38.760]  But they felt that I had a convincing voice
[01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:39.760]  So that's what they did then
[01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:42.760]  I started explaining that we had relationships with a few banks
[01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:44.760]  So they took out our primary bank two years ago
[01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:45.760]  We had to find new ones
[01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:47.760]  And just yesterday, Alex
[01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:50.760]  They took our second largest bank, Chase
[01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:53.760]  We've had relationships with them for over a quarter century
[01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:54.760]  And with no reason
[01:41:54.760 --> 01:41:55.760]  No reason at all
[01:41:55.760 --> 01:41:56.760]  They just wiped out
[01:41:56.760 --> 01:41:59.760]  Not only my personal account, the businesses' account
[01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:02.760]  But the accounts of my employees
[01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:05.760]  And the wives of my employees
[01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:07.760]  And this is while there's congressional hearings
[01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:09.760]  About the CIA and Justice Department
[01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:12.760]  With big corporations illegally harassing people
[01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:14.760]  This is beyond censorship
[01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:15.760]  Look at Nigel Farage
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:17.760]  And then the bank released his secret documents
[01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:18.760]  To the BBC saying
[01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:20.760]  It's because he's conservative
[01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:23.760]  And criticized transgender surgeries
[01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:26.760]  He'd been there almost 40 years
[01:42:26.760 --> 01:42:27.760]  His bank account taken away
[01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:29.760]  And then no other bank would take him
[01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:31.760]  So that the whole social credit score
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:33.760]  Evil is here
[01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:35.760]  Yeah, it is
[01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:37.760]  Thankfully, we have other banking relationships
[01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:40.760]  It's just a major pain to start to switch these things
[01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:43.760]  There's a lot of extra unnecessary work
[01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:46.760]  For essentially no reason that they provide
[01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:47.760]  But the point is down the road
[01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:49.760]  They're going to try to go after those banks
[01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:52.760]  They're very close to checkmate right now
[01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:55.760]  Yeah, they are
[01:42:55.760 --> 01:42:58.760]  So that's why I think we need to be prepared
[01:42:58.760 --> 01:43:00.760]  And what's been very clear to me
[01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:02.760]  Is one of the leaders in the movement
[01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:03.760]  To help people understand
[01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:05.760]  How to use natural strategies
[01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:06.760]  That are also inexpensive
[01:43:06.760 --> 01:43:09.760]  And as an alternative to the pharmaceutical industry
[01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:11.760]  The pharmaceutical model
[01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:15.760]  Is that I'm in the process of creating a course
[01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:18.760]  That maybe the legacy I leave behind
[01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:22.760]  Is an attempt to consolidate all the information
[01:43:22.760 --> 01:43:24.760]  I've been putting together in video format
[01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:25.760]  With transcription
[01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:27.760]  So that people can download through their computer
[01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:29.760]  Because I'm not convinced
[01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:30.760]  Absolutely not convinced
[01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:32.760]  That the internet will continue to be available
[01:43:32.760 --> 01:43:33.760]  Oh, I totally agree
[01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:35.760]  Their plan is to have a cyber attack
[01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:37.760]  And say that internet access
[01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:39.760]  Is allowing an ongoing Russian attack
[01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:41.760]  Then they use that for a kill switch
[01:43:41.760 --> 01:43:43.760]  To only allow us to visit a few establishment sites
[01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:45.760]  So you're dead on there, doctor
[01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:47.760]  We're getting really close
[01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:49.760]  And I don't know that it's this year or next year
[01:43:49.760 --> 01:43:50.760]  But it's coming
[01:43:50.760 --> 01:43:52.760]  I think it's way before 2030
[01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:53.760]  Way before that
[01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:57.760]  So it was just so magnificent
[01:43:57.760 --> 01:44:02.760]  To live in the luxury of pre-2016
[01:44:02.760 --> 01:44:05.760]  And essentially almost 20 years on the internet
[01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:07.760]  Of being able to spread this information
[01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:08.760]  Without censorship
[01:44:08.760 --> 01:44:11.760]  And really enabling people
[01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:12.760]  To regain their health
[01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:13.760]  And thank God
[01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:14.760]  I'm so grateful for that
[01:44:14.760 --> 01:44:15.760]  No, I totally agree
[01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:16.760]  But it's not about credit
[01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:17.760]  But I'm going to disagree with you
[01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:19.760]  Let's say here's a circle pond
[01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:22.760]  And here's Dr. Joseph Mercola
[01:44:22.760 --> 01:44:24.760]  And he throws a rock in
[01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:26.760]  First, 30 plus years ago
[01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:28.760]  And then its ripples
[01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:30.760]  Trigger all these other people
[01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:32.760]  That create all these other ripples
[01:44:32.760 --> 01:44:33.760]  So when you say
[01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:34.760]  Well they listed me as number one
[01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:35.760]  And Kennedy number two
[01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:37.760]  I was upset that I wasn't even on the list
[01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:40.760]  You're saying your current reach
[01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:41.760]  Which is massive
[01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:42.760]  You're like, oh I don't deserve this
[01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:43.760]  But no
[01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:45.760]  It's the ripples in the pond
[01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:48.760]  And so they can look at everything you've done
[01:44:48.760 --> 01:44:50.760]  And how it triggered everything else
[01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:52.760]  No, I would say you deserve the number one spot
[01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:53.760]  And I am actually envious
[01:44:53.760 --> 01:44:54.760]  But please continue
[01:44:56.760 --> 01:44:58.760]  There was a few other people that were envious too
[01:44:58.760 --> 01:44:59.760]  I didn't seek it
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:00.760]  I was surprised with it
[01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:03.760]  And actually one of the justifications for that
[01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:04.760]  Was the CCDH
[01:45:04.760 --> 01:45:06.760]  The Center for Countering Digital Hate
[01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:07.760]  That the New York Times
[01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:09.760]  And all the other media giants
[01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:11.760]  Used to justify this vilification
[01:45:11.760 --> 01:45:13.760]  And of course it's a front group
[01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:17.760]  For the Global Cabal in the UK
[01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:20.760]  And essentially the New York Times article
[01:45:20.760 --> 01:45:21.760]  The front page article
[01:45:21.760 --> 01:45:23.760]  And they listed in their news summary
[01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:25.760]  That day as the number one story
[01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:26.760]  In the world that day
[01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:29.760]  So I actually sued them last week
[01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:33.760]  There's a two year opportunity
[01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:35.760]  The statute of limitations is two years
[01:45:35.760 --> 01:45:37.760]  And we're closely approaching
[01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:38.760]  I think it might even be
[01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:40.760]  It might have been last week that we've had it
[01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:41.760]  So we sued them last week
[01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:43.760]  Because what they said was blatantly false
[01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:44.760]  Misinformation
[01:45:44.760 --> 01:45:47.760]  And they attempted to damage my reputation
[01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:49.760]  They used the hate designation
[01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:50.760]  To then take your banking
[01:45:50.760 --> 01:45:51.760]  That's how that works
[01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:52.760]  So this is news
[01:45:52.760 --> 01:45:53.760]  You're suing them
[01:45:53.760 --> 01:45:54.760]  Tell us about it
[01:45:56.760 --> 01:45:57.760]  Yeah, we're suing them
[01:45:57.760 --> 01:45:58.760]  Yeah, we're suing them
[01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:00.760]  Hopefully, I believe it's in the
[01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:02.760]  The jurisdiction of Louisiana
[01:46:02.760 --> 01:46:03.760]  Which is
[01:46:04.760 --> 01:46:05.760]  I'm pretty sure it's Louisiana
[01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:07.760]  Which is the one that they just
[01:46:09.760 --> 01:46:11.760]  Gave the favorable ruling
[01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:14.760]  On the Biden component
[01:46:14.760 --> 01:46:16.760]  Just last week or the week before last
[01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:18.760]  So they're really amenable
[01:46:18.760 --> 01:46:19.760]  To these types of suits
[01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:20.760]  And we're hoping to get jurisdiction there
[01:46:21.760 --> 01:46:22.760]  Beautiful
[01:46:22.760 --> 01:46:23.760]  Well, we've got 15 minutes left
[01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:24.760]  I appreciate you coming on short notice
[01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:26.760]  What do you make of LeBron James' son, Bronny
[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:27.760]  Having this heart attack
[01:46:27.760 --> 01:46:28.760]  You've got the floor, sir
[01:46:28.760 --> 01:46:29.760]  About just the bigger world
[01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:31.760]  You're an over-the-horizon guy
[01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:33.760]  You saw way out decades ahead
[01:46:33.760 --> 01:46:34.760]  We just love you
[01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:35.760]  On Mercola.com
[01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:38.760]  Please just give us your data
[01:46:38.760 --> 01:46:39.760]  On what you think is going on
[01:46:42.760 --> 01:46:43.760]  Well, I think
[01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:46.760]  First of all, there's many other celebrities
[01:46:46.760 --> 01:46:48.760]  That we don't hear about
[01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:50.760]  That it's because the information is hidden
[01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:51.760]  Or suppressed
[01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:52.760]  Or denied
[01:46:52.760 --> 01:46:53.760]  It's just outright denied
[01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:55.760]  That they don't want to give the impression
[01:46:55.760 --> 01:46:56.760]  That there's any connection at all
[01:46:56.760 --> 01:46:57.760]  To the vaccine
[01:46:57.760 --> 01:46:59.760]  So I'm very pleased
[01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:01.760]  That it's being made clear
[01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:02.760]  But Ed Dowd
[01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:03.760]  I don't know if he's been on your show
[01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:04.760]  But if he hasn't
[01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:05.760]  He should be
[01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:06.760]  He's done a magnificent job
[01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:08.760]  Of really exposing this fraud and deceit
[01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:10.760]  With the suspected numbers
[01:47:10.760 --> 01:47:13.760]  He was a former analyst for BlackRock
[01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:15.760]  And not one of the good guys for sure
[01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:16.760]  BlackRock
[01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:17.760]  But nevertheless
[01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:19.760]  He was very skilled
[01:47:19.760 --> 01:47:20.760]  In the financial markets
[01:47:20.760 --> 01:47:22.760]  And he just used his data collection
[01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:23.760]  And expertise
[01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:26.760]  To collect information about disabilities
[01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:29.760]  Primarily to show how damaging this was
[01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:31.760]  So yes, there's a lot of deaths
[01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:33.760]  But the disabilities is even more extraordinary
[01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:35.760]  It's really
[01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:37.760]  It's crippling the economy
[01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:38.760]  Because people
[01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:39.760]  I mean, people
[01:47:39.760 --> 01:47:40.760]  We see it
[01:47:40.760 --> 01:47:41.760]  And not only
[01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:42.760]  You know, how it's affected
[01:47:42.760 --> 01:47:44.760]  Commercial travel
[01:47:44.760 --> 01:47:46.760]  How it's affected the airline pilots
[01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:48.760]  You know, so many of them
[01:47:48.760 --> 01:47:49.760]  And they actually were
[01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:50.760]  Fired
[01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:51.760]  Or they quit
[01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:52.760]  Because of the vaccine mandates
[01:47:52.760 --> 01:47:53.760]  And they refused them
[01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:54.760]  The pilots that were wise
[01:47:54.760 --> 01:47:55.760]  And smart to do that
[01:47:55.760 --> 01:47:56.760]  So
[01:47:56.760 --> 01:47:58.760]  You know, that's one group
[01:47:58.760 --> 01:47:59.760]  And it impacts
[01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:00.760]  Today
[01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:01.760]  I don't travel very much
[01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:03.760]  But I know many people do
[01:48:03.760 --> 01:48:05.760]  And it's routinely
[01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:07.760]  That flights are cancelled or delayed
[01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:09.760]  Because they just don't have the cruise anymore
[01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:11.760]  It takes a few years
[01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:12.760]  Oh yeah, I'm forced to travel a lot
[01:48:12.760 --> 01:48:13.760]  And used to
[01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:15.760]  Every 20th flight got cancelled or so
[01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:17.760]  Half the time now
[01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:19.760]  They just cancel it for good
[01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:20.760]  There's no flight
[01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:21.760]  Yeah, yeah
[01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:22.760]  Yeah, yeah
[01:48:22.760 --> 01:48:23.760]  So it's
[01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:24.760]  And that's just
[01:48:24.760 --> 01:48:25.760]  To me, it's
[01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:27.760]  Signs of the beginning of the end
[01:48:27.760 --> 01:48:28.760]  This
[01:48:28.760 --> 01:48:29.760]  You know, it was
[01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:31.760]  The greatest country in the world
[01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:32.760]  It still had its problems back then
[01:48:32.760 --> 01:48:33.760]  But it's just
[01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:34.760]  It's capitulated
[01:48:34.760 --> 01:48:35.760]  This global cabal
[01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:36.760]  Has really
[01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:37.760]  Coalesced
[01:48:37.760 --> 01:48:38.760]  And
[01:48:38.760 --> 01:48:39.760]  Not only focused on the United States
[01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:40.760]  But it's pretty much
[01:48:40.760 --> 01:48:41.760]  The entire world
[01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:42.760]  They've captured
[01:48:42.760 --> 01:48:43.760]  They've done a magnificent job
[01:48:43.760 --> 01:48:44.760]  They've been very successful
[01:48:44.760 --> 01:48:45.760]  Very skillful
[01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:46.760]  Very careful
[01:48:46.760 --> 01:48:47.760]  Very patient
[01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:48.760]  This has not done
[01:48:48.760 --> 01:48:49.760]  Helter Skelter
[01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:50.760]  This was very
[01:48:50.760 --> 01:48:51.760]  Carefully
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:52.760]  Calculated
[01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:53.760]  And implemented
[01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:54.760]  And
[01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:55.760]  Very methodical
[01:48:55.760 --> 01:48:56.760]  Yeah, they were
[01:48:56.760 --> 01:48:58.760]  Extremely good at what they did
[01:48:58.760 --> 01:48:59.760]  And they were very effective
[01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:00.760]  So we have to understand that
[01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:01.760]  We are fighting
[01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:02.760]  Say we're fighting a Goliath
[01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:04.760]  Is an incredibly serious understatement
[01:49:04.760 --> 01:49:08.760]  I'm not sure that we can beat them
[01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:09.760]  Anything's possible
[01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:10.760]  But
[01:49:10.760 --> 01:49:11.760]  The control they've acquired
[01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:13.760]  With respect to government controls
[01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:14.760]  They just think we need
[01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:16.760]  To go somewhere quiet
[01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:17.760]  And just like
[01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:18.760]  Leave their influence
[01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:19.760]  And
[01:49:19.760 --> 01:49:20.760]  In some cases it may mean
[01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:21.760]  Leaving the country
[01:49:21.760 --> 01:49:22.760]  I think
[01:49:22.760 --> 01:49:23.760]  Well that's what our founders
[01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:24.760]  Came here to do
[01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:25.760]  And I agree
[01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:26.760]  But there's no
[01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:27.760]  The Israelites can't run
[01:49:27.760 --> 01:49:28.760]  Into the desert
[01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:29.760]  There's really
[01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:30.760]  Almost nowhere to go
[01:49:30.760 --> 01:49:31.760]  We're the best house
[01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:32.760]  In a bad neighborhood
[01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:33.760]  I think overall
[01:49:33.760 --> 01:49:34.760]  But I do agree with you
[01:49:34.760 --> 01:49:35.760]  If there was somewhere
[01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:36.760]  Some free country
[01:49:36.760 --> 01:49:37.760]  I'd been gone years ago
[01:49:37.760 --> 01:49:38.760]  So what do we
[01:49:38.760 --> 01:49:39.760]  I don't know
[01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:40.760]  There's a
[01:49:40.760 --> 01:49:41.760]  I don't know
[01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:42.760]  There's a free country
[01:49:42.760 --> 01:49:43.760]  Out there
[01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:44.760]  But there can be
[01:49:44.760 --> 01:49:45.760]  Countries that are less
[01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:46.760]  Oppressive
[01:49:46.760 --> 01:49:47.760]  And less tyrannical
[01:49:48.760 --> 01:49:49.760]  Than the U.S.
[01:49:49.760 --> 01:49:50.760]  Is heading for
[01:49:50.760 --> 01:49:51.760]  We're not there yet
[01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:53.760]  But we are running there rapidly
[01:49:53.760 --> 01:49:54.760]  No question about it
[01:49:55.760 --> 01:49:57.760]  And it concerns me deeply
[01:49:57.760 --> 01:49:58.760]  You know
[01:49:58.760 --> 01:49:59.760]  And it's just
[01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:00.760]  But it's you know
[01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:02.760]  This is a
[01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:04.760]  It's not our
[01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:05.760]  It's not our
[01:50:05.760 --> 01:50:06.760]  Responsibility
[01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:08.760]  To
[01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:09.760]  I guess
[01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:12.760]  Take massive action
[01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:13.760]  We just have to roll
[01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:14.760]  With the punches
[01:50:14.760 --> 01:50:15.760]  And you know
[01:50:15.760 --> 01:50:16.760]  Just know that
[01:50:16.760 --> 01:50:17.760]  This is only
[01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:18.760]  A temporary shell
[01:50:18.760 --> 01:50:19.760]  That we're
[01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:20.760]  Inhabiting
[01:50:20.760 --> 01:50:21.760]  And ultimately
[01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:22.760]  We're responsible
[01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:23.760]  For just doing
[01:50:23.760 --> 01:50:24.760]  The right thing
[01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:25.760]  In real time
[01:50:25.760 --> 01:50:26.760]  Well exactly
[01:50:26.760 --> 01:50:27.760]  I'm not one to surrender
[01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:28.760]  But if you're like
[01:50:28.760 --> 01:50:29.760]  A Jew
[01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:30.760]  Or somebody
[01:50:30.760 --> 01:50:31.760]  In 1939 Germany
[01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:32.760]  It's time to get out
[01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:33.760]  I mean at a certain point
[01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:34.760]  You gotta go
[01:50:34.760 --> 01:50:35.760]  Whoa
[01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:36.760]  Because the main battle
[01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:37.760]  For the future
[01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:38.760]  Is in America
[01:50:38.760 --> 01:50:39.760]  So they're planning
[01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:40.760]  To bring this thing down
[01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:41.760]  I mean they are
[01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:42.760]  Literally destroying
[01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:43.760]  The borders
[01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:44.760]  Shipping in fentanyl
[01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:45.760]  Promoting pedophilia
[01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:46.760]  It's wrecking
[01:50:46.760 --> 01:50:47.760]  The country right now
[01:50:47.760 --> 01:50:48.760]  Yeah
[01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:49.760]  And you were
[01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:50.760]  Very prescient
[01:50:50.760 --> 01:50:51.760]  I mean you were
[01:50:51.760 --> 01:50:52.760]  Warning people
[01:50:52.760 --> 01:50:53.760]  A long time ago
[01:50:53.760 --> 01:50:54.760]  And obviously
[01:50:54.760 --> 01:50:55.760]  You got the
[01:50:55.760 --> 01:50:56.760]  Massive labels
[01:50:56.760 --> 01:50:57.760]  Conspiracy theorists
[01:50:57.760 --> 01:50:58.760]  And really most
[01:50:58.760 --> 01:50:59.760]  Of the stuff
[01:50:59.760 --> 01:51:00.760]  That you were
[01:51:00.760 --> 01:51:01.760]  Talking about
[01:51:01.760 --> 01:51:02.760]  Was spot on
[01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:03.760]  And you really
[01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:04.760]  Were one of the
[01:51:04.760 --> 01:51:05.760]  First people out there
[01:51:05.760 --> 01:51:06.760]  Scream at this
[01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:07.760]  And you were
[01:51:07.760 --> 01:51:08.760]  The first
[01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:09.760]  To get the major
[01:51:09.760 --> 01:51:10.760]  Deep platforming
[01:51:10.760 --> 01:51:11.760]  And discrediting
[01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:12.760]  And they've really
[01:51:12.760 --> 01:51:13.760]  Stopped at
[01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:14.760]  Very little
[01:51:14.760 --> 01:51:15.760]  So we've only got
[01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:16.760]  7 minutes left
[01:51:16.760 --> 01:51:17.760]  Just other key points
[01:51:17.760 --> 01:51:18.760]  You want to add
[01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:19.760]  Because I only got
[01:51:19.760 --> 01:51:20.760]  A million points to make
[01:51:20.760 --> 01:51:21.760]  I don't have
[01:51:21.760 --> 01:51:22.760]  That many
[01:51:22.760 --> 01:51:23.760]  But I wouldn't
[01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:24.760]  You know I've
[01:51:24.760 --> 01:51:25.760]  I've been on your
[01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:26.760]  Show talking about
[01:51:26.760 --> 01:51:27.760]  Health things
[01:51:27.760 --> 01:51:28.760]  Because that's my thing
[01:51:28.760 --> 01:51:29.760]  Is health
[01:51:29.760 --> 01:51:30.760]  It's not really
[01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:31.760]  How to survive
[01:51:31.760 --> 01:51:32.760]  The global
[01:51:32.760 --> 01:51:33.760]  Coming from global
[01:51:33.760 --> 01:51:34.760]  Tyranny
[01:51:34.760 --> 01:51:35.760]  But you know
[01:51:35.760 --> 01:51:36.760]  My view is that
[01:51:36.760 --> 01:51:37.760]  If we build
[01:51:37.760 --> 01:51:38.760]  Our intrinsic health
[01:51:38.760 --> 01:51:39.760]  Because we
[01:51:39.760 --> 01:51:40.760]  God has given us
[01:51:40.760 --> 01:51:41.760]  The ability
[01:51:41.760 --> 01:51:42.760]  Our system
[01:51:42.760 --> 01:51:43.760]  To essentially
[01:51:43.760 --> 01:51:44.760]  It has the ability
[01:51:44.760 --> 01:51:45.760]  To recover
[01:51:45.760 --> 01:51:46.760]  From virtually
[01:51:46.760 --> 01:51:47.760]  Any disease
[01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:48.760]  I mean there are
[01:51:48.760 --> 01:51:49.760]  Certain circumstances
[01:51:49.760 --> 01:51:50.760]  If you get
[01:51:50.760 --> 01:51:51.760]  You got only
[01:51:51.760 --> 01:51:52.760]  4 weeks
[01:51:52.760 --> 01:51:53.760]  6 weeks
[01:51:53.760 --> 01:51:54.760]  To live
[01:51:54.760 --> 01:51:55.760]  You know at some
[01:51:55.760 --> 01:51:56.760]  Point you do pass
[01:51:56.760 --> 01:51:57.760]  A point of no return
[01:51:57.760 --> 01:51:58.760]  But almost any
[01:51:58.760 --> 01:51:59.760]  Other condition
[01:51:59.760 --> 01:52:00.760]  You can turn around
[01:52:00.760 --> 01:52:01.760]  And I'm
[01:52:01.760 --> 01:52:02.760]  Confident of that
[01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:03.760]  And the more
[01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:04.760]  I learn
[01:52:04.760 --> 01:52:05.760]  And understand
[01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:06.760]  Molecular biology
[01:52:06.760 --> 01:52:07.760]  And how it influences
[01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:08.760]  Health
[01:52:08.760 --> 01:52:09.760]  With natural
[01:52:09.760 --> 01:52:10.760]  Interventions
[01:52:10.760 --> 01:52:11.760]  The more
[01:52:11.760 --> 01:52:12.760]  I'm convinced
[01:52:12.760 --> 01:52:13.760]  I'm surprised
[01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:14.760]  I used to be
[01:52:14.760 --> 01:52:15.760]  The low carb
[01:52:15.760 --> 01:52:16.760]  High fat guy
[01:52:16.760 --> 01:52:17.760]  Keto guy
[01:52:17.760 --> 01:52:18.760]  And keto is
[01:52:18.760 --> 01:52:19.760]  97%
[01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:20.760]  Of the population
[01:52:20.760 --> 01:52:21.760]  In the United States
[01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:22.760]  97%
[01:52:22.760 --> 01:52:23.760]  Is metabolically
[01:52:23.760 --> 01:52:24.760]  Flexible
[01:52:24.760 --> 01:52:25.760]  And insulin resistant
[01:52:25.760 --> 01:52:26.760]  And they're
[01:52:26.760 --> 01:52:27.760]  Metabolically unhealthy
[01:52:27.760 --> 01:52:28.760]  So these are the people
[01:52:28.760 --> 01:52:29.760]  That would benefit
[01:52:29.760 --> 01:52:30.760]  From a short term
[01:52:30.760 --> 01:52:31.760]  Fast
[01:52:31.760 --> 01:52:32.760]  High fat
[01:52:32.760 --> 01:52:33.760]  Low carb
[01:52:33.760 --> 01:52:34.760]  Intermittent fasting
[01:52:34.760 --> 01:52:35.760]  You know that
[01:52:35.760 --> 01:52:36.760]  Will help them
[01:52:36.760 --> 01:52:37.760]  Recover their
[01:52:37.760 --> 01:52:38.760]  Insulin sensitivity
[01:52:38.760 --> 01:52:39.760]  But once they
[01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:40.760]  Recover
[01:52:40.760 --> 01:52:41.760]  If you continue
[01:52:41.760 --> 01:52:42.760]  Your health will
[01:52:42.760 --> 01:52:43.760]  Actually start to decline
[01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:44.760]  Because your body
[01:52:44.760 --> 01:52:45.760]  Needs sugar
[01:52:45.760 --> 01:52:47.760]  Glucose specifically
[01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:48.760]  And the ideal fuel
[01:52:48.760 --> 01:52:49.760]  For your mitochondria
[01:52:49.760 --> 01:52:50.760]  Which are the little
[01:52:50.760 --> 01:52:51.760]  Energy furnaces
[01:52:51.760 --> 01:52:52.760]  In your cells
[01:52:52.760 --> 01:52:53.760]  That create ATP
[01:52:53.760 --> 01:52:54.760]  Is sugar
[01:52:54.760 --> 01:52:55.760]  It's not fat
[01:52:55.760 --> 01:52:56.760]  Fat is actually
[01:52:56.760 --> 01:52:57.760]  Going to
[01:52:57.760 --> 01:52:58.760]  Consume more oxygen
[01:52:58.760 --> 01:52:59.760]  And create more reactive
[01:52:59.760 --> 01:53:00.760]  Oxygen species
[01:53:00.760 --> 01:53:01.760]  Than sugar
[01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:02.760]  The problem is
[01:53:02.760 --> 01:53:03.760]  If you have the
[01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:04.760]  Bad types of carb
[01:53:04.760 --> 01:53:05.760]  By sugar
[01:53:05.760 --> 01:53:06.760]  See any carbohydrate
[01:53:06.760 --> 01:53:07.760]  Even complex carbohydrates
[01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:08.760]  And vegetables
[01:53:08.760 --> 01:53:09.760]  That they
[01:53:09.760 --> 01:53:10.760]  Essentially
[01:53:11.760 --> 01:53:12.760]  And that's what gets
[01:53:12.760 --> 01:53:13.760]  Either metabolized
[01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:14.760]  In your mitochondria
[01:53:14.760 --> 01:53:15.760]  Or outside
[01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:16.760]  Inside the cell
[01:53:16.760 --> 01:53:17.760]  Outside the mitochondria
[01:53:17.760 --> 01:53:18.760]  In a process
[01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:19.760]  Called glycolysis
[01:53:19.760 --> 01:53:20.760]  And you don't want
[01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:21.760]  To do that
[01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:22.760]  Unless you're
[01:53:22.760 --> 01:53:23.760]  Running a race
[01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:24.760]  Or something
[01:53:24.760 --> 01:53:25.760]  But normally
[01:53:25.760 --> 01:53:26.760]  That's a prescription
[01:53:26.760 --> 01:53:27.760]  For disaster
[01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:28.760]  So there's some
[01:53:28.760 --> 01:53:29.760]  Really
[01:53:29.760 --> 01:53:30.760]  Profoundly eye-opening
[01:53:30.760 --> 01:53:31.760]  Things
[01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:32.760]  I've had the most
[01:53:32.760 --> 01:53:33.760]  Amazing
[01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:34.760]  Health epiphanies
[01:53:34.760 --> 01:53:35.760]  Of my entire life
[01:53:35.760 --> 01:53:36.760]  Just this year
[01:53:36.760 --> 01:53:37.760]  And I've radically
[01:53:37.760 --> 01:53:38.760]  Changed some views
[01:53:38.760 --> 01:53:39.760]  Evolved some views
[01:53:39.760 --> 01:53:40.760]  And as this
[01:53:40.760 --> 01:53:41.760]  Understanding improves
[01:53:41.760 --> 01:53:42.760]  So I would encourage
[01:53:42.760 --> 01:53:43.760]  People if they haven't
[01:53:43.760 --> 01:53:45.760]  Been exposed to that
[01:53:45.760 --> 01:53:47.760]  To subscribe to my newsletter
[01:53:47.760 --> 01:53:48.760]  Mercola.com
[01:53:48.760 --> 01:53:49.760]  It's free
[01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:50.760]  And you get to see it
[01:53:50.760 --> 01:53:51.760]  For two days
[01:53:51.760 --> 01:53:52.760]  For free
[01:53:52.760 --> 01:53:53.760]  The first day
[01:53:53.760 --> 01:53:54.760]  It comes out
[01:53:54.760 --> 01:53:55.760]  And the next day
[01:53:55.760 --> 01:53:56.760]  Then after that
[01:53:56.760 --> 01:53:57.760]  It goes to
[01:53:57.760 --> 01:53:58.760]  The sub-sec
[01:53:58.760 --> 01:53:59.760]  Our site
[01:53:59.760 --> 01:54:00.760]  Which is pretty inexpensive
[01:54:00.760 --> 01:54:01.760]  It's $5 a month
[01:54:01.760 --> 01:54:02.760]  This is an interesting
[01:54:02.760 --> 01:54:03.760]  Conversation
[01:54:03.760 --> 01:54:04.760]  Because I was
[01:54:04.760 --> 01:54:05.760]  Hanging out with
[01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:06.760]  Joe Rogan
[01:54:06.760 --> 01:54:07.760]  I hung out with him
[01:54:07.760 --> 01:54:08.760]  Quite a bit
[01:54:08.760 --> 01:54:09.760]  And I was like
[01:54:09.760 --> 01:54:10.760]  Dude, you look even younger
[01:54:10.760 --> 01:54:11.760]  And even more ripped
[01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:12.760]  What are you doing?
[01:54:12.760 --> 01:54:13.760]  And he said
[01:54:13.760 --> 01:54:14.760]  Well, I used to be mainly
[01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:15.760]  On the carnivore diet
[01:54:15.760 --> 01:54:17.760]  But now the science shows
[01:54:17.760 --> 01:54:18.760]  That once you use that
[01:54:18.760 --> 01:54:19.760]  To get really in good shape
[01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:20.760]  Then you later
[01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:21.760]  Actually need stuff
[01:54:21.760 --> 01:54:22.760]  From certain fruits
[01:54:22.760 --> 01:54:24.760]  Now I'm eating more fruit
[01:54:24.760 --> 01:54:26.760]  But I'm also fasting
[01:54:26.760 --> 01:54:28.760]  He went on this whole spiel
[01:54:28.760 --> 01:54:29.760]  And I was like
[01:54:29.760 --> 01:54:30.760]  Okay, well that's
[01:54:30.760 --> 01:54:31.760]  I mean, he looks great
[01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:32.760]  I mean, it was incredible
[01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:33.760]  He is spot on
[01:54:33.760 --> 01:54:34.760]  And you know
[01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:35.760]  Last year
[01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:36.760]  I was having
[01:54:36.760 --> 01:54:37.760]  100 grams of carbs a day
[01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:38.760]  To 500 grams
[01:54:38.760 --> 01:54:39.760]  But most of it
[01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:40.760]  Is just like you said
[01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:41.760]  Ripe fruit
[01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:42.760]  This is, you know
[01:54:42.760 --> 01:54:43.760]  Really
[01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:44.760]  So Joe's obviously following
[01:54:44.760 --> 01:54:45.760]  That science
[01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:46.760]  Because he tells
[01:54:46.760 --> 01:54:47.760]  So tell us about that
[01:54:47.760 --> 01:54:49.760]  Yeah
[01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:50.760]  Well
[01:54:50.760 --> 01:54:51.760]  And I'll just tell you
[01:54:51.760 --> 01:54:52.760]  What happened to me
[01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:55.760]  I lost 10 pounds
[01:54:55.760 --> 01:54:56.760]  By quadrupling
[01:54:56.760 --> 01:54:57.760]  My carbohydrate intake
[01:54:57.760 --> 01:54:58.760]  And my body fat percentage
[01:54:58.760 --> 01:55:01.760]  Went from 15% to 12%
[01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:03.760]  And my fasting blood sugar
[01:55:03.760 --> 01:55:04.760]  Dropped by 10 points
[01:55:04.760 --> 01:55:06.760]  So it worked for me
[01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:07.760]  But you've got
[01:55:07.760 --> 01:55:08.760]  Not everyone can have
[01:55:08.760 --> 01:55:09.760]  500 grams of carbs
[01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:10.760]  I work out quite a bit
[01:55:10.760 --> 01:55:11.760]  As does Joe
[01:55:11.760 --> 01:55:12.760]  So I can tolerate that high amount
[01:55:12.760 --> 01:55:13.760]  But most people could go
[01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:15.760]  For 200, 300 grams
[01:55:15.760 --> 01:55:16.760]  As long as their fat intake
[01:55:16.760 --> 01:55:17.760]  Is relatively low
[01:55:17.760 --> 01:55:19.760]  Because if you have high carb
[01:55:19.760 --> 01:55:20.760]  With high fat
[01:55:20.760 --> 01:55:21.760]  Disaster
[01:55:21.760 --> 01:55:22.760]  But the single most important fat
[01:55:22.760 --> 01:55:23.760]  You have to limit
[01:55:23.760 --> 01:55:24.760]  Everyone needs to limit
[01:55:24.760 --> 01:55:25.760]  You can go to my website
[01:55:25.760 --> 01:55:26.760]  This is
[01:55:26.760 --> 01:55:27.760]  This is
[01:55:27.760 --> 01:55:29.760]  The most foundational
[01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:30.760]  Most important strategy
[01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:31.760]  You can do
[01:55:31.760 --> 01:55:32.760]  To take control of your health
[01:55:32.760 --> 01:55:34.760]  Is to remove the seed oils
[01:55:34.760 --> 01:55:35.760]  From your diet
[01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:36.760]  And if you go to Substack
[01:55:36.760 --> 01:55:37.760]  Substack.com
[01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:39.760]  And you just type in
[01:55:39.760 --> 01:55:40.760]  Mercola
[01:55:40.760 --> 01:55:41.760]  Or take control
[01:55:41.760 --> 01:55:43.760]  You'll go to my Substack site
[01:55:43.760 --> 01:55:45.760]  And there's an article
[01:55:45.760 --> 01:55:46.760]  Linoleic acid
[01:55:46.760 --> 01:55:47.760]  Right in the middle there
[01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:48.760]  And you can click on it
[01:55:48.760 --> 01:55:49.760]  And
[01:55:49.760 --> 01:55:50.760]  And it took
[01:55:50.760 --> 01:55:52.760]  There's a 30 minute video
[01:55:52.760 --> 01:55:53.760]  On there that explains it
[01:55:53.760 --> 01:55:54.760]  Step by step
[01:55:54.760 --> 01:55:55.760]  It took me six months to create
[01:55:55.760 --> 01:55:56.760]  And there's also a link
[01:55:56.760 --> 01:55:57.760]  To the paper
[01:55:57.760 --> 01:55:58.760]  And give us the name
[01:55:58.760 --> 01:55:59.760]  Of it again
[01:55:59.760 --> 01:56:00.760]  Because I've watched it before
[01:56:00.760 --> 01:56:01.760]  But I'm gonna watch it again
[01:56:01.760 --> 01:56:02.760]  Yeah it's called
[01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:03.760]  It's linoleic acid
[01:56:03.760 --> 01:56:04.760]  Most dangerous component
[01:56:05.760 --> 01:56:06.760]  Most dangerous stealth component
[01:56:06.760 --> 01:56:07.760]  Of your diet
[01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:08.760]  So the video
[01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:09.760]  So what oils are okay?
[01:56:09.760 --> 01:56:11.760]  Is olive oil okay?
[01:56:11.760 --> 01:56:13.760]  Well there's a link
[01:56:13.760 --> 01:56:14.760]  To the peer review paper
[01:56:14.760 --> 01:56:15.760]  On nutrients
[01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:16.760]  Which is a very high impact
[01:56:16.760 --> 01:56:17.760]  Journal that I just had
[01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:18.760]  Published last week
[01:56:18.760 --> 01:56:19.760]  So you can go into the science
[01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:21.760]  With all the 150 references to it
[01:56:21.760 --> 01:56:23.760]  So this is not some hogwash stuff
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:25.760]  But I would read the article
[01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:26.760]  It took a long time to write
[01:56:26.760 --> 01:56:27.760]  The article
[01:56:27.760 --> 01:56:28.760]  Six months to make that video
[01:56:28.760 --> 01:56:29.760]  So the information is there
[01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:30.760]  Olive oil
[01:56:30.760 --> 01:56:32.760]  I can give you short answers
[01:56:32.760 --> 01:56:33.760]  But not in a minute
[01:56:33.760 --> 01:56:34.760]  You really do need to
[01:56:34.760 --> 01:56:35.760]  Breathe the whole thing
[01:56:35.760 --> 01:56:36.760]  So that's foundational
[01:56:36.760 --> 01:56:37.760]  But normally you want to
[01:56:37.760 --> 01:56:38.760]  Keep your fat below 30%
[01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:40.760]  Once you're metabolically flexible
[01:56:40.760 --> 01:56:41.760]  And then you can start
[01:56:41.760 --> 01:56:42.760]  Introducing the carbs
[01:56:42.760 --> 01:56:43.760]  Now if you're diabetic
[01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:46.760]  Or obese
[01:56:46.760 --> 01:56:47.760]  Then you may even want to
[01:56:47.760 --> 01:56:49.760]  Go down to 20 or 15
[01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:50.760]  Maybe even 10% fat
[01:56:50.760 --> 01:56:51.760]  And then put on the carbohydrates
[01:56:51.760 --> 01:56:53.760]  Because if you have too much fat
[01:56:53.760 --> 01:56:54.760]  It doesn't work with
[01:56:54.760 --> 01:56:55.760]  Being able to properly
[01:56:55.760 --> 01:56:57.760]  Metabolize the glucose
[01:56:57.760 --> 01:56:58.760]  So it's a fine balance
[01:56:58.760 --> 01:56:59.760]  It needs to be customized
[01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:00.760]  For the individual
[01:57:00.760 --> 01:57:02.760]  But it's a radical game changer
[01:57:03.760 --> 01:57:04.760]  Well that's incredible
[01:57:04.760 --> 01:57:05.760]  Because it wasn't like some
[01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:06.760]  Weird thing
[01:57:06.760 --> 01:57:07.760]  Joe's a walking billboard
[01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:08.760]  So he gets off his show
[01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:09.760]  He's wearing one shirt
[01:57:09.760 --> 01:57:10.760]  He's about to go on a comedy set
[01:57:10.760 --> 01:57:11.760]  He's wearing another
[01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:13.760]  So we're in this green room
[01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:14.760]  He pulls his shirt off
[01:57:14.760 --> 01:57:15.760]  And I've known the guys
[01:57:15.760 --> 01:57:16.760]  For 25 years
[01:57:16.760 --> 01:57:17.760]  I'm like what?
[01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:18.760]  You look like a gymnast
[01:57:18.760 --> 01:57:19.760]  You're totally ripped
[01:57:19.760 --> 01:57:20.760]  And he goes yeah dude
[01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:21.760]  I'm going on this new thing
[01:57:21.760 --> 01:57:22.760]  Where I'm eating more fruit
[01:57:22.760 --> 01:57:23.760]  And I was just like wow
[01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:24.760]  So he was kind of giving me
[01:57:24.760 --> 01:57:25.760]  The same thing you were saying
[01:57:25.760 --> 01:57:26.760]  He was telling me
[01:57:26.760 --> 01:57:27.760]  You need to do it
[01:57:27.760 --> 01:57:28.760]  You need to do it
[01:57:28.760 --> 01:57:29.760]  And he was giving me
[01:57:29.760 --> 01:57:30.760]  Website links and stuff
[01:57:30.760 --> 01:57:31.760]  So it sounds like a really smart
[01:57:32.760 --> 01:57:33.760]  After you're metabolically
[01:57:33.760 --> 01:57:34.760]  Flexible you go on keto
[01:57:34.760 --> 01:57:35.760]  For a while
[01:57:35.760 --> 01:57:36.760]  And then you can go
[01:57:36.760 --> 01:57:37.760]  Or low fat
[01:57:37.760 --> 01:57:38.760]  And lots of fruit
[01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:39.760]  Doc we got a two minute break
[01:57:39.760 --> 01:57:40.760]  And I got G. Edward Griffin
[01:57:40.760 --> 01:57:41.760]  Coming up
[01:57:41.760 --> 01:57:42.760]  But stay with us
[01:57:42.760 --> 01:57:43.760]  Five more minutes
[01:57:43.760 --> 01:57:44.760]  I want to finish this discussion
[01:57:44.760 --> 01:57:45.760]  Then G. Edward Griffin
[01:57:45.760 --> 01:57:46.760]  Takes over
[01:57:47.150 --> 01:58:05.150]  We finally have our original best selling colloidal silver back in stock. With the supply chain breakdowns and all the problems in the economy, we could not get the highest quality colloidal silver for almost three years back in stock.
[01:58:05.150 --> 01:58:12.150]  But now we've got it. 30 parts per million from the top lab. We've got a limited shipment. Hopefully we'll have a lot of it in the future.
[01:58:12.150 --> 01:58:27.150]  But if you want to experience and have in your medicine cabinet, have in your preparedness arsenal high quality colloidal silver from the best manufacturer, we have it right now private labeled under the name Silver Bullet at Infowarsstore.com.

[01:58:45.150 --> 01:58:58.150]  You're going to want to pay attention to what I'm about to say in the next 60 seconds. Two new incredible products are now available exclusively at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:58:58.150 --> 01:59:10.150]  They are both clones of national best selling products from a major pharmaceutical supplement maker that are listeners and patriots that are allowing us to private label it at a lower price than you'll find in stores.
[01:59:10.150 --> 01:59:27.150]  It's Joint Relief Max and Nerve Renew. Both of these have known documented natural compounds to lower pain and to also make your nerves healthier, which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated and are more inductive to pain.
[01:59:27.150 --> 01:59:46.150]  There's major research behind this all. You need to get Joint Relief Max from Infowars MD and Nerve Renew from Infowars MD exclusively at Infowarsstore.com right now. Introducing them both. 25% off. You'll find them exclusively at Infowarsstore.com and they fund our operation.
[01:59:46.150 --> 02:00:10.150]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:10.150 --> 02:00:25.150]  Dr. Joseph Mercola is our guest. I've been interviewing him over 25 years. He's been battling for over 30 and he was saying some really serious stuff about engineer collapsed the world, the great reset, getting prepared for it, how serious it is.
[02:00:25.150 --> 02:00:38.150]  And I agree with him. It's a probability now, not just a possibility that we're going into very serious tyranny in the Western world and major upheaval.
[02:00:38.150 --> 02:00:43.150]  So can you just in a few minutes we have left, sir, kind of flesh that out for folks?
[02:00:43.150 --> 02:00:51.150]  Well, I think it's pretty obvious if you analyze the data that things have gotten much, much worse and progressively, almost exponentially.
[02:00:51.150 --> 02:00:59.150]  So this I'm honestly quite surprised that they were able to do it this quickly.
[02:00:59.150 --> 02:01:04.150]  Or effectively, you know, this pandemic is just it's mind boggling if you think about it.
[02:01:04.150 --> 02:01:17.150]  And really one of the most impressive victories that they've had was that they were able to brainwash, literally brainwash the majority of the population.
[02:01:17.150 --> 02:01:22.150]  They propagandized them with the most effective propaganda campaign in the history of the world.
[02:01:22.150 --> 02:01:37.150]  And that was three years ago. We know we've got chatbots now, we've got large language models, applications of A.I. that are going to make their ability to do this far more effective.
[02:01:37.150 --> 02:01:43.150]  The large language model, that's what they work with is language and language is how we control human behavior.
[02:01:43.150 --> 02:01:47.150]  So they were good before, but they're going to get exponentially better.
[02:01:47.150 --> 02:01:51.150]  And these models, they're not static. They're dynamic. They're continuing to improve at a regular rate.
[02:01:51.150 --> 02:02:09.150]  And that's the fear that many computer scientist experts have, is that they're going to maybe report a paradox for them because they may advance at such an exponential rate that it'll be out of the cabal's ability to even control them.
[02:02:09.150 --> 02:02:13.150]  So and, you know, it potentially poses an existential threat.
[02:02:13.150 --> 02:02:24.150]  So we don't know. I mean, history is certainly, I'm not a fortune teller, but I certainly am an observer of circumstances.
[02:02:24.150 --> 02:02:29.150]  And it seems like we're going in a direction that thankfully is good.
[02:02:29.150 --> 02:02:38.150]  It feels so good to have this summer without any restrictions or loss of freedoms and have the flexibility to essentially enjoy freedom.
[02:02:38.150 --> 02:02:42.150]  But it may be for one of the last times. And I hope not. I hope and pray not.
[02:02:42.150 --> 02:02:53.150]  But that's just the system, the Death Star re-energizing. I feel it. I see it. They just, the last was a beta test to gauge things. The real assault's about to happen.
[02:02:53.150 --> 02:03:02.150]  I think that's the case. I mean, it makes the most sense. I hope and pray it isn't. But the probability points to that direction.
[02:03:02.150 --> 02:03:11.150]  Well, well, I mean, there's come back soon and I appreciate coming on short notice. You're a hard guy to get on. We do a whole hour on solutions.
[02:03:11.150 --> 02:03:17.150]  But I think the Amish may have it. But who has the resources to do that? I think the only way to beat this is to...
[02:03:17.150 --> 02:03:27.150]  No, no, that's a good point. That is a really good example, an Amish community that you can get tied into foundationally that are not relying on a lot of technology.
[02:03:27.150 --> 02:03:36.150]  I mean, that's what you really want. And they know how to endure hardship. So there's no way, there is no way anyone will do well.
[02:03:36.150 --> 02:03:44.150]  I'm absolutely committed that the most fundamental component you're going to need is community. You've got, you cannot do it as a Lone Ranger.
[02:03:44.150 --> 02:03:50.150]  You're going to need a group of people to go in with because you don't have the skills. No one has the skill set to go through this.
[02:03:50.150 --> 02:03:58.150]  I mean, it's not, oh, maybe it's not. There might be a few outliers out there, but typically the average person does not. You're going to need a community to do it.
[02:03:58.150 --> 02:04:09.150]  And then you need your health. Health is your best well, right? So that's why I recommend that you follow me in my newsletter at Mercola.com and, you know, learn the newest things.
[02:04:09.150 --> 02:04:16.150]  You know, the stuff that Joe Rogan's using with this, the application of integrating fruit is one of the healthiest foods at the right time.
[02:04:16.150 --> 02:04:26.150]  You just can't go and take fruit frivolously. It's, you know, some people are going to make worse, but if you do it at the right time in the right sequence, it can radically change your health as it did for me and did for Joe Rogan.
[02:04:26.150 --> 02:04:36.150]  Dr. Joseph Mercola, Mercola.com, we love you. You tell the crew when you want to come back on the next few months for a full hour or a special report. We love you. Thank you so much, sir.
[02:04:36.150 --> 02:04:38.150]  All right. Thank you, Alex. All the best.
[02:04:38.150 --> 02:04:51.150]  Thank you. That was amazing. That guy is so smart. Another OG, like OG of OG's is set to come on. G. Edward Griffin, got a Red Pill Expo coming up next month in Des Moines, Iowa. Stay with us.
[02:05:08.150 --> 02:05:18.150]  Amazing. Then a huge dose of Chaga mushroom, a massive dose of beef pollen, a gigantic dose of highest quality turmeric, and then it just gets crazier from there.

[02:06:04.150 --> 02:06:32.150]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. Live from Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:32.150 --> 02:06:44.150]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we have a living legend with us for the hour. If it wasn't for G. Edward Griffin, we would not have the modern liberty movement we have today.
[02:06:44.150 --> 02:06:55.150]  Before there was Ron Paul, before there was Alex Jones, before there was Tucker Carlson, before there was Joe Rogan, before there was Dr. Peter McCullough or Joseph Mercola,
[02:06:55.150 --> 02:07:08.150]  there was G. Edward Griffin. And it's not about credit, he doesn't care about that, but instrumentally exposing the private and federal reserve, exposing the communist collectivist plans, exposing so much of what they do.
[02:07:08.150 --> 02:07:22.150]  Warning about Trump before Trump pushed the poison shot, G. Edward Griffin. RedPillExpo.org, it's almost sold out, but you can get tickets still coming up in, I guess it's the 12th or 13th from memory.
[02:07:23.150 --> 02:07:33.150]  I'm trying to get there, but I've also got a deposition with bankruptcy right after that in Devoin, Iowa. Find out about that at RedPillExpo.org.
[02:07:33.150 --> 02:07:42.150]  So he really doesn't need an introduction to our regular viewers and listeners, but for other people out there that don't know, G. Edward Griffin was a successful corporate executive,
[02:07:42.150 --> 02:07:50.150]  found out about the new world order, decided he would investigate some of the leftist ideology and went down the rabbit hole and he joins us now.
[02:07:50.150 --> 02:08:00.150]  So I'm going to really try to just sit back and let him talk because back when nobody was doing it, people think I was a trailblazer, like, oh, Alex Jones was right.
[02:08:00.150 --> 02:08:07.150]  Well, G. Edward Griffin was really right. He was making films and theaters and just, I mean, documentaries.
[02:08:07.150 --> 02:08:16.150]  And really, if you trace back the epicenter of so much of the resistance today and the creature of Jekyll Island and his bestselling books, it's G. Edward Griffin.
[02:08:16.150 --> 02:08:23.150]  So G. Edward, RedPillExpo.org, we'll link it up at Empowars.com. We love you and we just really appreciate you.
[02:08:23.150 --> 02:08:26.150]  So where would you like to start, my friend?
[02:08:27.150 --> 02:08:31.150]  Alex, I love your introduction. It makes me feel important.
[02:08:31.150 --> 02:08:33.150]  Well, you are important.
[02:08:33.150 --> 02:08:43.150]  Well, I'm important only in the minds of people because I'm just like everybody else. I've been fighting this battle, that's true, for a long, long time.
[02:08:43.150 --> 02:08:53.150]  But there were other people, too. It's just that they didn't have the opportunity to put their efforts on film and so nobody remembers what they did.
[02:08:53.150 --> 02:08:58.150]  Fortunately, that's what I knew a little bit about back in those days is how to make films.
[02:08:58.150 --> 02:09:03.150]  I had gone to school and I had learned communications and filmmaking and television and all that stuff, you know.
[02:09:03.150 --> 02:09:17.150]  So when I got into the real world and I decided I wanted to make a difference, I thought, well, how do I communicate to a lot of people at the same time so that I don't have to stand in front of the little living room groups like I was doing at that time?
[02:09:17.150 --> 02:09:22.150]  Sixty people, forty people at a time. I said, I'm not going to change the world to fifty people at a time.
[02:09:22.150 --> 02:09:28.150]  So we started to make these films and that's what put me on the map because the film survived.
[02:09:28.150 --> 02:09:36.150]  Whereas the work, the good work, all of the other people that were in the arena with me at that time, this faded away. So I was very fortunate.
[02:09:36.150 --> 02:09:44.150]  Well, absolutely, but I know it's not about praising you, but we need to recognize why we've had such success today.
[02:09:44.150 --> 02:09:50.150]  So, I mean, look at Elon Musk. Don't trust him, but he's attacking the globalist their whole program.
[02:09:50.150 --> 02:09:55.150]  I mean, look at Joe Rogan, look at Tucker Carlson. I mean, right now I go out on the street, I get nothing but love.
[02:09:55.150 --> 02:10:01.150]  Two years ago, nothing but hate. There seems to be a revolution or a great awakening.
[02:10:01.150 --> 02:10:07.150]  And I'm not saying it's perfect. I'm not saying it's a panacea, but wow, it's a lot better than nobody knowing what's going on.
[02:10:07.150 --> 02:10:17.150]  Well, I agree with that totally. It's refreshing to have friends out there for a change instead of people who think that you ought to be put in a loony band somewhere.
[02:10:17.150 --> 02:10:30.150]  But I think we need to be cautious about that because over the years I've learned to have great respect for our opponent, whatever, however you want to describe our opponent.
[02:10:30.150 --> 02:10:34.150]  Let's call it globalism, as I think is a very good phrase for it.
[02:10:34.150 --> 02:10:43.150]  I call it collectivism, the new world order. There are a lot of different names for a cabal of relatively few people, very wealthy, very powerful.
[02:10:43.150 --> 02:10:52.150]  Behind the scenes, by the way. And they're very smart. And I don't know where their headquarters is or anything like that.
[02:10:52.150 --> 02:11:01.150]  I know it's not in government because governments are their puppets, people who think that they're government leaders, the people they vote for.
[02:11:01.150 --> 02:11:08.150]  If they think they're the ones making the decisions, it's a big mistake because it hasn't been that way in a long, long time.
[02:11:08.150 --> 02:11:15.150]  The real decision makers are relatively unknown to the average person. They're not in the news. You don't see them.
[02:11:15.150 --> 02:11:28.150]  Oh, there I am. Look at that. That's when I was first starting to grow a beard. Well, anyway, as I was saying, so back to the idea of being acceptable all of a sudden, it's a refreshing thing.
[02:11:28.150 --> 02:11:35.150]  But I also know, and I'm starting to say this, is that our opponent has buildings full of strategies.
[02:11:35.150 --> 02:11:46.150]  If you think the Pentagon is loaded with people who prepare strategies and playbooks, I'm sure that these people do that, too.
[02:11:46.150 --> 02:11:56.150]  They know exactly what's happening because they have professionals who do nothing all day long, all week long, all year long, except to plan, well, what happens if this happens?
[02:11:56.150 --> 02:12:03.150]  Then what do we do? And they think about that and they talk about it and they index it and put it away in a book.
[02:12:03.150 --> 02:12:14.150]  Well, what happens if this happens? And so there's nothing happening today that they didn't foresee a long time ago and that they didn't plan for.
[02:12:14.150 --> 02:12:22.150]  And I have studied their works as best I can. Some of them are published. Some of them are very private and hard to come by.
[02:12:22.150 --> 02:12:31.150]  But there's one recurring theme in there which I wish I could communicate to everybody more effectively than I have been able to do, and that's this.
[02:12:31.150 --> 02:12:42.150]  They know that they're going to be very, very unpopular as the time comes when the iron fist is removed from the belt glove.
[02:12:42.150 --> 02:12:47.150]  They know when the population finally wakes up and says, oh, my God, what have we gotten into?
[02:12:48.150 --> 02:12:54.150]  This is terrible, but there's going to be a big awakening, we call it, a big pushback against them.
[02:12:54.150 --> 02:13:01.150]  So what do they do about it? They have a playbook for that. And their playbook, now I hope everybody's sitting down for this.
[02:13:01.150 --> 02:13:11.150]  Their playbook is very wise. It says, why should we wait around for opposition against us? Let us create our own opposition.
[02:13:12.150 --> 02:13:20.150]  Let us make the biggest moves against ourselves so that we control both sides of the conflict.
[02:13:20.150 --> 02:13:24.150]  And that way we give the people what they want, which is a good fight.
[02:13:24.150 --> 02:13:30.150]  They want to think that they're trying to do something to determine their own political destiny.
[02:13:30.150 --> 02:13:37.150]  They want to think that their vote counts. They want to think that their passing of the literature and all this organization and so forth.
[02:13:37.150 --> 02:13:43.150]  They're doing these things. And so we have to do that ourselves. But it could have hurt us.
[02:13:43.150 --> 02:13:49.150]  It's like the best analogy I can think of is a wrestling manager.
[02:13:49.150 --> 02:13:56.150]  He owns a couple of wrestlers, maybe three or four of them, and quite often two of his own guys get in the ring and they fight each other.
[02:13:56.150 --> 02:14:02.150]  Now, the manager of the wrestlers doesn't care which one wins because no matter which one wins, it's money in his pocket.
[02:14:02.150 --> 02:14:11.150]  It's his profession. And the game is to make it appear that these guys in the ring are really opponents when in fact they're play actors.
[02:14:11.150 --> 02:14:15.150]  But they have to be good at play acting. They have to beat each other up.
[02:14:15.150 --> 02:14:21.150]  They have to do things that really damage the other guy. And it's a hard business to be in.
[02:14:21.150 --> 02:14:26.150]  But I'm sure at the end of the day they meet in the locker room and say, boy, that was a good fight you put on there.
[02:14:26.150 --> 02:14:32.150]  Boy, when you got me on the backside there, I thought I was going to die. It was a good show, buddy. Good show.
[02:14:32.150 --> 02:14:37.150]  And then they go out to the bar and have a drink. Politics is like that today.
[02:14:37.150 --> 02:14:43.150]  And so what I'm trying to say is that when we see people out there on the street rising up and saying,
[02:14:43.150 --> 02:14:52.150]  follow me, I'm going to bring an end to this collectivist globalist tyranny, you better be careful.
[02:14:52.150 --> 02:14:58.150]  Some of them may not be what you think they are. And I'm just saying that you have to be very cautious.
[02:14:58.150 --> 02:15:01.150]  Well, do you ever, Griffin, let me interrupt because I think you're, feel free.
[02:15:01.150 --> 02:15:05.150]  You were warning me about Trump on air five years ago saying he's not a panacea.
[02:15:05.150 --> 02:15:10.150]  I don't think he's controlled consciously, but he may be controlled by manipulation.
[02:15:10.150 --> 02:15:13.150]  He went along with the poison shot. He won't come out against it.
[02:15:13.150 --> 02:15:18.150]  And sure, they're planning to put him in prison, but that made him the frontrunner.
[02:15:18.150 --> 02:15:22.150]  Is that their Hegelian dialectic? He's probably not conscious of it.
[02:15:22.150 --> 02:15:25.150]  Well, he may or may not be conscious of it.
[02:15:25.150 --> 02:15:32.150]  I don't want to really focus on Mr. Trump particularly because it's a high octane subject.
[02:15:32.150 --> 02:15:39.150]  People have wrapped their whole hopes, all of their hopes for a future around Mr. Trump.
[02:15:39.150 --> 02:15:40.150]  It's a tar baby.
[02:15:40.150 --> 02:15:42.150]  Yeah, a tar baby.
[02:15:42.150 --> 02:15:45.150]  And so when you start saying, well, wait a minute, this is not the real thing.
[02:15:45.150 --> 02:15:48.150]  All of a sudden you have an enemy because they don't want to hear that.
[02:15:48.150 --> 02:15:50.150]  They think you are the enemy.
[02:15:50.150 --> 02:15:57.150]  It's really a powerful and very dangerous spot to be in when you start criticizing leaders.
[02:15:57.150 --> 02:16:04.150]  But you have to because if you know what I think I know, and that is that this is how they play the game,
[02:16:04.150 --> 02:16:10.150]  they provide their own leaders to the extent that they can, and they're very, very good at it.
[02:16:10.150 --> 02:16:13.150]  But we know that you're not controlled. I know I'm not controlled.
[02:16:13.150 --> 02:16:15.150]  I know they've certainly tried to get me to join them.
[02:16:15.150 --> 02:16:23.150]  So expanding on all of this, how would you say it's going for the globalist and the new world order?
[02:16:23.150 --> 02:16:25.150]  Because we know they want to end the family.
[02:16:25.150 --> 02:16:26.150]  They want to atomize us.
[02:16:26.150 --> 02:16:28.150]  They want to turn us into commodities.
[02:16:28.150 --> 02:16:29.150]  They want to control us like animals.
[02:16:29.150 --> 02:16:31.150]  Those are their goals.
[02:16:31.150 --> 02:16:33.150]  They set up China as their laboratory.
[02:16:33.150 --> 02:16:35.150]  Now it seems China's broken with them.
[02:16:35.150 --> 02:16:40.150]  I think that's probably a real thing, kind of like Stalin and Hitler were buddies up front
[02:16:40.150 --> 02:16:42.150]  and turned against each other.
[02:16:42.150 --> 02:16:51.150]  I mean, sure, evil's organized, but it always tends to pull out the knives when they're about to win and fight over the power.
[02:16:51.150 --> 02:16:57.150]  And that's why the founders set up separation of powers to exacerbate tyrants battling for control.
[02:16:57.150 --> 02:17:01.150]  So as bad as it seems, I see a lot of silver linings.
[02:17:01.150 --> 02:17:04.150]  Well, I think that's a good analogy, Alex.
[02:17:04.150 --> 02:17:06.150]  There are silver linings.
[02:17:07.150 --> 02:17:13.150]  Perhaps this is a bad topic for me to start off with today because it sounds a little bit negative.
[02:17:13.150 --> 02:17:22.150]  I want to follow up by saying I'm quite positive about what's happening in spite of the fact that I know that there are some mines planted out there.
[02:17:22.150 --> 02:17:24.150]  We don't want to step in these mines.
[02:17:24.150 --> 02:17:30.150]  There are mines in the minefield waiting for us to step on them and to follow false leaders.
[02:17:30.150 --> 02:17:31.150]  That's all I'm trying to say.
[02:17:31.150 --> 02:17:34.150]  Now, who they are, who the false ones are, who the real ones are,
[02:17:34.150 --> 02:17:36.150]  it's not so easy to tell.
[02:17:36.150 --> 02:17:45.150]  But I think we have to be alert to the fact, and this is a fact, that some of them will not be what they appear to be.
[02:17:45.150 --> 02:17:55.150]  And it's up to us to be very, very careful about how we just throw ourselves into the battle and whose flag we're going to follow because it might be a false leader.
[02:17:55.150 --> 02:17:59.150]  Now, that applies to a lot of people.
[02:17:59.150 --> 02:18:09.150]  Maybe they don't realize that they are being used, but it's very advantageous for them to do what they're doing because the door is open for them.
[02:18:09.150 --> 02:18:11.150]  They have a lot of money behind them.
[02:18:11.150 --> 02:18:12.150]  They have publicity.
[02:18:12.150 --> 02:18:15.150]  They have political positions that they're allowed to get into.
[02:18:15.150 --> 02:18:20.150]  They have good publicity so their elections are successful and all that.
[02:18:20.150 --> 02:18:26.150]  So their tendency is to be willingly blind to reality and say,
[02:18:26.150 --> 02:18:31.150]  Well, yeah, I don't trust these guys, but they're giving me money, and I don't really like them.
[02:18:31.150 --> 02:18:36.150]  But they're telling me, you know, if I follow what they do, I'll be elected or whatever the story is.
[02:18:36.150 --> 02:18:40.150]  Maybe they have something in their background that they don't want to have revealed.
[02:18:40.150 --> 02:18:42.150]  It might be blackmail, as we all know.
[02:18:42.150 --> 02:18:44.150]  It's a big thing out there.
[02:18:44.150 --> 02:18:50.150]  Child pornography is not just because there's a bunch of old guys playing around with little kids.
[02:18:50.150 --> 02:18:53.150]  They're trying to compromise very important people.
[02:18:54.150 --> 02:18:56.150]  It's video or something and so forth.
[02:18:56.150 --> 02:19:01.150]  In the more horrible situations they can videotape them, the better blackmail subjects they become.
[02:19:01.150 --> 02:19:07.150]  Well, sure, G. Edward, from my experience, studying the globalist in crime in general,
[02:19:07.150 --> 02:19:11.150]  it's like the Mexican mafia or the white supremacists or the black gangs.
[02:19:11.150 --> 02:19:15.150]  You go out and rob a liquor store and shoot the owner so that you're now compromised.
[02:19:15.150 --> 02:19:18.150]  They now accept you because you're a murderer.
[02:19:18.150 --> 02:19:23.150]  And so people who went to Jeffrey Epstein and the CIA and MI6 and Mossad,
[02:19:23.150 --> 02:19:28.150]  they knew they were going to a facility to rape a child, you know, a 12-year-old, a 10-year-old,
[02:19:28.150 --> 02:19:30.150]  to be on video to be made members.
[02:19:30.150 --> 02:19:32.150]  It's not like they were even victims.
[02:19:32.150 --> 02:19:36.150]  They were willing victims in this.
[02:19:36.150 --> 02:19:39.150]  And so that's what I see them doing.
[02:19:39.150 --> 02:19:45.150]  But I see their system coming to an end because so many average people see that it's so destructive.
[02:19:45.150 --> 02:19:47.150]  Just today, I've got the clips here.
[02:19:47.150 --> 02:19:49.150]  I'm not going to play them because of time constraints.
[02:19:49.150 --> 02:19:50.150]  Maybe I should.
[02:19:50.150 --> 02:19:59.150]  But the White House press secretary said, yeah, we are going to ban your gas stoves
[02:19:59.150 --> 02:20:03.150]  and your gas water heaters and your gas generators.
[02:20:03.150 --> 02:20:06.150]  Well, last year they proposed it and said, no, that's a conspiracy theory.
[02:20:06.150 --> 02:20:07.150]  We aren't.
[02:20:07.150 --> 02:20:09.150]  Now they're like, yeah, we're going to ban them.
[02:20:09.150 --> 02:20:11.150]  That right there devastates people.
[02:20:11.150 --> 02:20:12.150]  We export our gas.
[02:20:12.150 --> 02:20:17.150]  China doesn't cut off its fuel because here's the meme right here, overhead shot, please.
[02:20:17.150 --> 02:20:20.150]  Why isn't China concerned about global warming?
[02:20:20.150 --> 02:20:23.150]  They already have a communist government.
[02:20:23.150 --> 02:20:25.150]  So that's it.
[02:20:25.150 --> 02:20:36.150]  But the point is, literally cutting off completely clean natural gas is the equivalent of German bombers bombing power plants during the Blitz.
[02:20:36.150 --> 02:20:38.150]  I mean, this is war.
[02:20:38.150 --> 02:20:40.150]  So they've taken the gloves off.
[02:20:41.150 --> 02:20:46.150]  They're cutting 25 percent of nitrogen production in fertilizer in the last two years.
[02:20:46.150 --> 02:20:49.150]  That will cause total collapse in the third world.
[02:20:49.150 --> 02:20:52.150]  So the point is, we're not in Kansas anymore.
[02:20:52.150 --> 02:20:58.150]  They are really creating a global crisis out of which they believe they're going to have their global solution.
[02:20:58.150 --> 02:21:08.150]  And here on the eve or the twilight, you could even say, of this insanity, before we're pulled under the water by the riptide,
[02:21:08.150 --> 02:21:10.150]  we're taking one more gulp of oxygen.
[02:21:10.150 --> 02:21:13.150]  I mean, you can feel it, you can intellectually see it.
[02:21:13.150 --> 02:21:15.150]  They've got big plans.
[02:21:15.150 --> 02:21:25.150]  And so give us your view on the existential crisis we're entering that they're engineering to bring in what or just wherever you want to go.
[02:21:25.150 --> 02:21:27.150]  Well, sure, that's the big picture, isn't it?
[02:21:27.150 --> 02:21:30.150]  And I think you summarized it pretty well, Alex.
[02:21:30.150 --> 02:21:38.150]  And everybody can see it pretty well now, too, even if they haven't been scholars about reading the literature that goes back a few decades.
[02:21:38.150 --> 02:21:40.150]  But the plan is quite simple.
[02:21:40.150 --> 02:21:44.150]  And if you had to put one word to it, it's destruction.
[02:21:44.150 --> 02:21:59.150]  This isn't normal warfare where you, when I say normal, I mean old style warfare, where you conquer a nation or a territory by invading armies.
[02:21:59.150 --> 02:22:03.150]  Now, of course, it's communications and technology.
[02:22:03.150 --> 02:22:12.150]  You conquer it one brain at a time by capturing or neutralizing the brains of the people, their loyalties.
[02:22:12.150 --> 02:22:16.150]  You filter the information to their brains and they come up with the wrong conclusions.
[02:22:16.150 --> 02:22:19.150]  They follow the wrong leaders, for example, and go back to that.
[02:22:19.150 --> 02:22:21.150]  So this is how it's done.
[02:22:21.150 --> 02:22:31.150]  And destruction is an important part of that because everything they do, as you just pointed out, is obviously is not productive.
[02:22:31.150 --> 02:22:33.150]  It's not going to work.
[02:22:33.150 --> 02:22:34.150]  What's wrong with these people?
[02:22:34.150 --> 02:22:35.150]  Are they idiots?
[02:22:35.150 --> 02:22:36.150]  That's not going to work.
[02:22:36.150 --> 02:22:39.150]  It's going to destroy our economy and so forth.
[02:22:39.150 --> 02:22:41.150]  Tell the president about this.
[02:22:41.150 --> 02:22:43.150]  I must write a letter to the president.
[02:22:43.150 --> 02:22:45.150]  He should know about this.
[02:22:45.150 --> 02:22:47.150]  They don't realize that the president knows all about this.
[02:22:47.150 --> 02:22:55.150]  And he's probably very knowledgeable about it and becomes a part of it because he has no choice, or maybe worse.
[02:22:55.150 --> 02:23:00.150]  But he might be just compelled to do it for other reasons that we've talked about.
[02:23:00.150 --> 02:23:06.150]  So then if everybody knows it doesn't work, then why do they do it?
[02:23:06.150 --> 02:23:07.150]  And there's a good picture.
[02:23:07.150 --> 02:23:10.150]  It's destruction to destroy, to destroy.
[02:23:10.150 --> 02:23:24.150]  Because once you destroy the economy of a system, destroy the unity of a nation, the cultural unity of a nation, you have nothing but individuals wandering around trying to survive.
[02:23:24.150 --> 02:23:28.150]  And they don't think very much about constitutional liberties or privileges.
[02:23:28.150 --> 02:23:30.150]  They don't think about human rights.
[02:23:30.150 --> 02:23:32.150]  All they worry about is just surviving.
[02:23:32.150 --> 02:23:33.150]  Look at these poor people here.
[02:23:33.150 --> 02:23:36.150]  They don't care about what's under constitution.
[02:23:36.150 --> 02:23:43.150]  Those people care about, will I eat, will I sleep, will I be protected against the cold, and so forth.
[02:23:43.150 --> 02:23:47.150]  A man who's drowning doesn't want to talk about the constitution.
[02:23:47.150 --> 02:23:49.150]  All he wants to do is get some air.
[02:23:49.150 --> 02:23:51.150]  He wants to get to the top of the water.
[02:23:51.150 --> 02:23:58.150]  So that's the strategy our enemy has used, is to get people in a position where they're drowning, really, and they're afraid that they're going to die.
[02:23:58.150 --> 02:23:59.150]  They can't survive.
[02:23:59.150 --> 02:24:08.150]  And so they don't want to talk about these niceties about human rights and freedom of speech and all these nicer things because all they want to do is survive.
[02:24:08.150 --> 02:24:17.150]  That's where they want the world to be because out of that dust, out of that chaos, they can remold society exactly as they wish.
[02:24:17.150 --> 02:24:23.150]  And people won't care about the loss of liberties as long as they'll be taken care of physically.
[02:24:23.150 --> 02:24:26.150]  I totally agree. Incredibly eloquent, G. Edward Griffin.
[02:24:26.150 --> 02:24:36.150]  So then from your research and 60 years of battling these people, if we capitulated, because they never even debate us like we're real.
[02:24:36.150 --> 02:24:38.150]  We want to debate subjects and what they're doing.
[02:24:38.150 --> 02:24:40.150]  They always deny it and treat us like children.
[02:24:40.150 --> 02:24:45.150]  But if we just capitulated and said, fine, we'll do whatever you want, what would they do?
[02:24:45.150 --> 02:24:49.150]  What would they build?
[02:24:49.150 --> 02:24:51.150]  Well, they build exactly what they're building right now.
[02:24:51.150 --> 02:24:59.150]  They build a system in which everybody is so dependent upon the system itself to survive that they'll never question it.
[02:24:59.150 --> 02:25:12.150]  They'll know that the technology will be the police of the system, because if you violate the rules and you do criticize the system, then you will not survive.
[02:25:12.150 --> 02:25:16.150]  So they want an end of history, total stagnation, collapse.
[02:25:17.150 --> 02:25:22.150]  They want an end of independent human activity.
[02:25:22.150 --> 02:25:26.150]  They want everybody to be in lockstep with their directives from the top.
[02:25:26.150 --> 02:25:35.150]  I used to think of it in terms, I still do, by the way, in terms of living in a society that's totally military.
[02:25:35.150 --> 02:25:38.150]  Now, I was in the military for a couple of years.
[02:25:38.150 --> 02:25:42.150]  It was a joke because I never saw any action, any military action.
[02:25:42.150 --> 02:25:44.150]  And I was all stateside and all that sort of thing.
[02:25:44.150 --> 02:25:52.150]  But I did discover the mentality of the military world, and that is that as long as you behave and do what you're told, you do pretty good.
[02:25:52.150 --> 02:26:01.150]  They feed you, they clothe you, they provide medical care, and they give you a little bit of money, and they provide you with entertainment.
[02:26:01.150 --> 02:26:04.150]  Everything you really need, the basics are provided for you.
[02:26:04.150 --> 02:26:10.150]  And if you move up the ranks, then you get to go out of the enlisted category.
[02:26:10.150 --> 02:26:14.150]  You become an lieutenant or then a major and a colonel and a general and so forth.
[02:26:14.150 --> 02:26:19.150]  The higher you go, the more privileges you have and the more luxuries you have.
[02:26:19.150 --> 02:26:26.150]  When you get way up in scale, you've got a chauffeur, a private plane, and the whole works, you know, and a mansion to live in.
[02:26:26.150 --> 02:26:30.150]  And it doesn't make any difference how much money you make because you don't need money.
[02:26:30.150 --> 02:26:33.150]  You're living in a system that provides everything.
[02:26:33.150 --> 02:26:38.150]  And that's why they say you'll own nothing and have nothing because the global corporate system has it.
[02:26:38.150 --> 02:26:48.150]  All their officers get to have it. You get your $2,000 a month of bug protein, but they get private jets and mansions that they don't own but that they have access to.
[02:26:48.150 --> 02:26:52.150]  Exactly. That's it. That's the military system.
[02:26:52.150 --> 02:26:56.150]  And so I think there's a certain other element to it.
[02:26:56.150 --> 02:26:59.150]  There's an occult element. There's a vicious element to it.
[02:26:59.150 --> 02:27:03.150]  Let's call it an evil element to it that you may not find in the military.
[02:27:03.150 --> 02:27:13.150]  But it's basically that kind of a system where everything is regimented and your success in the system depends entirely on your obedience to the system.
[02:27:13.150 --> 02:27:15.150]  It has nothing to do with your marriage.
[02:27:15.150 --> 02:27:20.150]  So it's turning us into robots. We're about to go to break, but spend a few minutes on the evil element, G. Edward Griffin.
[02:27:20.150 --> 02:27:26.150]  We're going to break in a few minutes. What is the evil element?
[02:27:27.150 --> 02:27:31.150]  Oh, the evil element. Oh, I thought that was the commercial, Alex.
[02:27:31.150 --> 02:27:44.150]  Well, the evil element is I think that people are being recruited into this movement on the collectivist side based primarily on their personality as well as their beliefs.
[02:27:44.150 --> 02:28:03.150]  I remember I was shocked to learn that when Nazi Germany was being developed and militarized and expanded and organized that the young men who were recruited into the SS were chosen because of their sadistic tendencies.
[02:28:03.150 --> 02:28:05.150]  They made a conscious effort for that.
[02:28:05.150 --> 02:28:13.150]  And part of the test, for example, was that the young man applying for the SS training was given a puppy, a young dog, a little puppy.
[02:28:13.150 --> 02:28:18.150]  And they had to take care of that puppy all through the training, which was, I think, about six months or something like that.
[02:28:18.150 --> 02:28:22.150]  And at the end of the training, the men didn't know it.
[02:28:22.150 --> 02:28:29.150]  Maybe some of them did, but at the end of the training, they were required to slit the throat of the dog.
[02:28:29.150 --> 02:28:39.150]  And they knew that by that time, normal people would develop some kind of an affinity, an affection toward that little dog that they had to take care of.
[02:28:39.150 --> 02:28:42.150]  And some of the men couldn't do it.
[02:28:42.150 --> 02:28:44.150]  And of course, they were rejected.
[02:28:44.150 --> 02:28:46.150]  They only wanted the men who could do it.
[02:28:46.150 --> 02:28:48.150]  And then I found out that...
[02:28:48.150 --> 02:28:50.150]  Hold on, stand there. Now we got to go to break.
[02:28:50.150 --> 02:28:52.150]  G. Edward Griffin is our amazing guest.
[02:28:52.150 --> 02:28:57.150]  Stay with us.
[02:28:57.150 --> 02:29:00.150]  It's been three years since we had it.

[02:30:24.150 --> 02:30:27.150]  That'll make it 20, 30, 40% like we do on the products.
[02:30:27.150 --> 02:30:28.150]  But these really are amazing products.
[02:30:28.150 --> 02:30:30.150]  The big July 4 sale is going on right now.
[02:30:30.150 --> 02:30:33.150]  This is such a critical platform in the fight against the new world order.
[02:30:33.150 --> 02:30:34.150]  The enemy's out in the open.
[02:30:34.150 --> 02:30:35.150]  We're vindicated.
[02:30:35.150 --> 02:30:36.150]  People are listening more than ever.
[02:30:36.150 --> 02:30:41.150]  But in this major recession going into depression and with supply chain breakdowns, I know it's hard.
[02:30:41.150 --> 02:30:42.150]  I know times are tough.
[02:30:42.150 --> 02:30:44.150]  So thank you for your support.
[02:30:44.150 --> 02:30:49.150]  But whatever you do, pray for the broadcast and share the articles and the videos that you can do for free.
[02:30:49.150 --> 02:30:51.150]  And that's just as important as keeping us on air.
[02:30:51.150 --> 02:30:54.150]  So however God leads you in your heart to support us, please support us now.
[02:30:54.150 --> 02:30:56.150]  And I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[02:30:56.150 --> 02:30:57.150]  God bless you.
[02:30:57.150 --> 02:31:01.150]  You're going to want to pay attention to what I'm about to say in the next 60 seconds.

[02:32:56.950 --> 02:33:05.950]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:11.950 --> 02:33:18.950]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:26.950 --> 02:33:38.950]  RedPillExpo.org. Once a year, big event coming up this year in Des Moines, Iowa in just a couple weeks.
[02:33:38.950 --> 02:33:41.950]  Keep tickets left, find out about it at RedPillExpo.org.
[02:33:41.950 --> 02:33:51.950]  We have the iconic G. Edward Griffin with us live right now talking about the incredible period in history we're in.
[02:33:51.950 --> 02:33:57.950]  And as negative as the things he's talking about are, he made the point, he's very optimistic.
[02:33:57.950 --> 02:34:03.950]  But we need to still talk about the enemy's landmines, their plans, what they're doing. Please continue, sir.
[02:34:03.950 --> 02:34:14.950]  Well yes, Alex, I am optimistic for reasons which let us not forget to come to at the end of this show because we are talking about problems and they're our solutions.
[02:34:14.950 --> 02:34:24.950]  Anyway, we're talking about the deliberate use of selecting sadistic people to do the dirty work in this battle we're in.
[02:34:24.950 --> 02:34:38.950]  And we were talking about the fact that the SS in Nazi Germany had the design of making sure that the only people qualified to be enrolled and given officer status.
[02:34:38.950 --> 02:34:40.950]  That's right, you got cut off. I should have said that.
[02:34:40.950 --> 02:34:44.950]  Start over because this is really important and I read this in mainline history, the Nazis didn't deny this.
[02:34:44.950 --> 02:34:50.950]  They would have SS candidates going through their boot camp, would have to raise a German Shepherd and then murder it.
[02:34:50.950 --> 02:34:59.950]  And then if you had that humanity, you had that loyalty to this dog, then you failed. So please start over.
[02:34:59.950 --> 02:35:02.950]  Yes, well that was it, exactly what they did.
[02:35:02.950 --> 02:35:22.950]  And anybody that couldn't slaughter this dog that they raised for six months or so, they didn't qualify to be part of the SS because they knew they needed people who had the ability to inflict pain on humans and animals without any particular remorse.
[02:35:22.950 --> 02:35:38.950]  And then, okay, that was tucked away in my memory from a long time ago and something fairly recently shocked me again because I found out that there was the same type of plan being applied today within certain branches of our intelligence community.
[02:35:38.950 --> 02:35:44.950]  I say our intelligence community, I mean the one that's working within our government, it's not necessarily ours.
[02:35:45.950 --> 02:35:53.950]  So this is just a replay of the Milgram, I mean of the Nazis reform, but the Milgram experiment, the Stanford research studies where they got...
[02:35:53.950 --> 02:36:06.950]  I think it's on top of that, Alex, because that experiment just proved that people could be convinced to override their instincts if they were following authority.
[02:36:06.950 --> 02:36:11.950]  That they would do horrible things just because they were told to do it by somebody in a white coat.
[02:36:11.950 --> 02:36:23.950]  And the same thing would be true in the military, if they were told to do something horrible by somebody who had stripes on his sleeve or brass insignia on his collar, you would have to do it.
[02:36:23.950 --> 02:36:28.950]  And you were no longer in control of your own decisions, supposedly.
[02:36:28.950 --> 02:36:31.950]  And so this is the kind of the thing that they were looking for.
[02:36:31.950 --> 02:36:44.950]  I know in these so-called intelligence agencies, they look for people who are capable of following orders and doing what would normally be considered a horrible thing.
[02:36:44.950 --> 02:36:51.950]  And it's the old idea, ours is not to question why, ours is what to do or die, right?
[02:36:51.950 --> 02:36:55.950]  It's that kind of mentality that's built into the military.
[02:36:55.950 --> 02:37:08.950]  So anyway, I was going to say that they actually have personality tests and actual training exercises and testing in real life where they find people who have a sadistic component in their brains.
[02:37:08.950 --> 02:37:13.950]  And those are the ones they want for these top positions, sadists.
[02:37:13.950 --> 02:37:18.950]  And that's no accident, it's selected for, it's consciously determined.
[02:37:18.950 --> 02:37:22.950]  You ask, what is evil? Oh wait, what is bad? That is evil to me.
[02:37:22.950 --> 02:37:29.950]  There are people that have this evil streak in them, and those are the ones that gravitate into this kind of work.
[02:37:29.950 --> 02:37:37.950]  Those are the ones who are selected because they're capable of performing their tasks without any conscience at all against their fellow human beings.
[02:37:37.950 --> 02:37:40.950]  So it's no accident, is what I'm trying to say.
[02:37:40.730 --> 02:37:54.730]  So, here we are. I mean, world government, new world order, UN control, they're not coming with blue helmets, they're coming with syringes. What do we do?
[02:37:54.730 --> 02:38:04.730]  Well, okay, now we get to the fun part. First of all, we have to understand, really understand what we're up against.
[02:38:04.730 --> 02:38:16.730]  Not just at some surface level of, oh great, now we understand, we're going to unite and let's form into a great unity, a movement of unified desire for freedom and this is going to solve the problem.
[02:38:16.730 --> 02:38:26.730]  It won't solve the problem until we know the complete story, which is that in that environment we know that our enemy knew we would be calling for this kind of action.
[02:38:27.730 --> 02:38:40.730]  And long ago they had determined, if not the exact person or people who they will offer as our leaders, they all, they did know what type of people they would select to offer as our leaders.
[02:38:40.730 --> 02:38:51.730]  And so now, we will have great opportunity to win this battle only if we understand this tactic because if we don't, we will fall for it and we will be defeated.
[02:38:51.730 --> 02:39:00.730]  But if we do understand it, we'll know what to ask, what kind of questions to ask, we'll be able to tell who are the real leaders and who are the false leaders.
[02:39:00.730 --> 02:39:05.730]  And the best way to tell is the old saying, by their fruits you shall know them.
[02:39:05.730 --> 02:39:18.730]  You need to understand their backgrounds, not just what they're saying today, what did they say five years ago, what were they doing ten years ago, what's their history and let's find out all about their beliefs.
[02:39:18.730 --> 02:39:26.730]  Now, one person may be very strong, let's say, on the COVID issue, oh, that person, he's got it right, we should follow this leader.
[02:39:26.730 --> 02:39:32.730]  What does that person think about the money system? What does that person think about…
[02:39:32.730 --> 02:39:37.730]  I was about to say, Senator Johnson is really good on vaccines but horrible on everything else.
[02:39:37.730 --> 02:39:47.730]  Yeah, so what good is that? You see, we lose, we lose because we just get focused on one thing, well he's good on that and it's the old idea, it's the lesser of two evils.
[02:39:47.730 --> 02:39:54.730]  We have been going down the toilet for decades with this flag that says, I voted for the lesser of two evils, you see.
[02:39:54.730 --> 02:40:03.730]  No, we've got to stop voting for the lesser of two evils, we have to start not just voting for but selecting candidates for who is going to be on the ballot.
[02:40:03.730 --> 02:40:12.730]  Well that's the thing, evil's able to organize, why aren't good people, you've been trying that for a long time, what is it about good people that we're not good at organizing?
[02:40:13.730 --> 02:40:21.730]  Well I think there are two things because, well first of all the evil people have a lot of money and the good people tend not to have a lot of money.
[02:40:21.730 --> 02:40:30.730]  I don't know whether that is cause and effect or what but that's part of it because if you make the money, which the international banking fraternity does,
[02:40:30.730 --> 02:40:37.730]  it literally creates the money out of debt or out of nothing, it's even worse than debt, debt is worse than nothing I should say.
[02:40:37.730 --> 02:40:46.730]  So if you have that power to create money, if you're a central banker and you can create money out of loans, you have unlimited amount of money.
[02:40:46.730 --> 02:40:53.730]  No I totally agree and then anybody that's able to make a little compared to them like Infowars, they didn't come after, that's why the pages don't have money
[02:40:53.730 --> 02:40:56.730]  cause anytime we try to build anything they blow it up.
[02:40:56.730 --> 02:41:06.730]  Right, but the thing that they don't have and they wish they did is what we do have and that is that we have people that don't have to be paid to fight this battle for freedom.
[02:41:06.730 --> 02:41:11.730]  They do it because they want to, because they have to, because it's in them.
[02:41:11.730 --> 02:41:13.730]  We have the spirit.
[02:41:13.730 --> 02:41:20.730]  We have the spirit, they don't, they have to buy and blackmail and torture their people into participating.
[02:41:20.730 --> 02:41:24.730]  Whereas our people are saying, what can we do, what can we do, show me, put me in, you know.
[02:41:24.730 --> 02:41:28.730]  So they wish they had that, so we have that tremendous power.
[02:41:28.730 --> 02:41:41.730]  But the only thing we're most vulnerable on is that we're suckers for that, in tennis where they have a special serve, you know, they serve the ball and it has a twist to it and it bends and you swing where you thought it was going to be.
[02:41:41.730 --> 02:41:43.730]  The spin, the English.
[02:41:43.730 --> 02:41:46.730]  The spin, yeah. The English, that's what it is, yes.
[02:41:46.730 --> 02:41:55.730]  They have the English and until we recognize the spin that they're using against us on the serve, we're going to be swinging in the wrong place every time.
[02:41:56.730 --> 02:42:01.730]  So just determine the nation and the passion and all that is necessary and is powerful.
[02:42:01.730 --> 02:42:08.730]  It's our gasoline, but if we want to win this battle, we have to learn how to create our own candidates.
[02:42:08.730 --> 02:42:11.730]  We have to build a movement of our own.
[02:42:11.730 --> 02:42:15.730]  It's over when we say, let's see, the election is coming up, who are we going to vote for?
[02:42:15.730 --> 02:42:18.730]  What? Who are we going to vote for?
[02:42:18.730 --> 02:42:23.730]  That's one of our biggest issues is we don't lie, so our candidates run and are on us and they block us.
[02:42:23.730 --> 02:42:30.730]  I've never said being deceptive, but I sit back and say, what if we lied and posed as communists and got in?
[02:42:30.730 --> 02:42:32.730]  I'm not saying do that, but that is a paradox.
[02:42:32.730 --> 02:42:34.730]  No, that is a paradox, yeah.
[02:42:34.730 --> 02:42:40.730]  But that would be totally wrong because then what difference would this be whether we were in or they were in?
[02:42:40.730 --> 02:42:45.730]  We're both liars and you cannot have liars as your leaders.
[02:42:45.730 --> 02:42:49.730]  Yeah, plus you shouldn't promote the ideology to get elected.
[02:42:49.730 --> 02:42:51.730]  That's wrong.
[02:42:52.730 --> 02:42:54.730]  Well, yeah, that's Leninism.
[02:42:54.730 --> 02:42:56.730]  Lenin taught that in his works.
[02:42:56.730 --> 02:43:01.730]  He always said, comrades, if we were going to go into a country and take it over,
[02:43:01.730 --> 02:43:08.730]  and that country had strong traditions of national pride and culture and all tradition,
[02:43:08.730 --> 02:43:12.730]  you go in there and say, we are communists and we believe in internationalism
[02:43:12.730 --> 02:43:19.730]  and we want to change your traditions and we want collectivism and we want to change your system.
[02:43:19.730 --> 02:43:22.730]  What would happen? Well, they would reject us.
[02:43:22.730 --> 02:43:25.730]  So don't do that, comrades. Don't be stupid.
[02:43:25.730 --> 02:43:28.730]  Go in there and tell them that you are a nationalist.
[02:43:28.730 --> 02:43:31.730]  Tell them that you are an anti-communist.
[02:43:31.730 --> 02:43:35.730]  Tell them what they want to hear, comrades, so they will follow you.
[02:43:35.730 --> 02:43:39.730]  This is Lenin, I'm quoting, I'm not paraphrasing.
[02:43:39.730 --> 02:43:42.730]  Tell them what they want to hear so they will follow you as their leader.
[02:43:42.730 --> 02:43:44.730]  Now you come to power.
[02:43:44.730 --> 02:43:46.730]  That's the goal, to come to power, he said.
[02:43:46.730 --> 02:43:53.730]  Once you are in power, now you can do whatever you want because if they object, you can shoot them.
[02:43:53.730 --> 02:43:55.730]  He literally says these things.
[02:43:55.730 --> 02:43:59.730]  You know, promises are like pie crusts made to be broken.
[02:43:59.730 --> 02:44:00.730]  This is all Lenin.
[02:44:00.730 --> 02:44:03.730]  So we have to understand, this is what we're up against.
[02:44:03.730 --> 02:44:08.730]  We think we're just playing high school football or something, you know.
[02:44:08.730 --> 02:44:12.730]  We're against scientifically deployed evil.
[02:44:12.730 --> 02:44:14.730]  I mean, we're up against academic evil.
[02:44:15.730 --> 02:44:19.730]  Yeah, even high school football has the Statue of Liberty playing, you know.
[02:44:19.730 --> 02:44:24.730]  To deceive the other side to think that they're going to throw the ball when in fact they're going to run with it or something like that.
[02:44:24.730 --> 02:44:28.730]  Even in high school football, we understand there's deception involved.
[02:44:28.730 --> 02:44:32.730]  But when it comes to global politics, we say, oh, they wouldn't lie, would they?
[02:44:32.730 --> 02:44:34.730]  They wouldn't deceive us, would they?
[02:44:34.730 --> 02:44:35.730]  Of course they would.
[02:44:35.730 --> 02:44:37.730]  And that's the point I'm trying to drive.
[02:44:37.730 --> 02:44:38.730]  Well, let me ask you this.
[02:44:38.730 --> 02:44:39.730]  Let me ask you this.
[02:44:39.730 --> 02:44:46.730]  As it becomes incredibly obvious that the new world order in globalism destroys the average person and is a nightmare system,
[02:44:46.730 --> 02:44:52.730]  it should be quite easy to get the public to join against it if we can just identify that global government exists.
[02:44:52.730 --> 02:44:56.730]  And now global government's out in the open, so our jobs should be easy.
[02:44:58.730 --> 02:45:02.730]  Well, yeah, the job is not just to get them to join a movement.
[02:45:02.730 --> 02:45:05.730]  The job is to make sure that the movement is the right one to join.
[02:45:06.730 --> 02:45:08.730]  That's the problem when I'm trying to drive that here.
[02:45:08.730 --> 02:45:16.730]  It's easy to get people lined up and riled up and show up in the streets with some of these magnificent rallies we've seen, very encouraging.
[02:45:16.730 --> 02:45:18.730]  There must be a million or two million people.
[02:45:18.730 --> 02:45:19.730]  And as far as…
[02:45:19.730 --> 02:45:24.730]  No, I get a million people there, Trump gets a million, and then they steer it into January 6th. I get it.
[02:45:25.730 --> 02:45:26.730]  Yes, you get it.
[02:45:26.730 --> 02:45:28.730]  Okay, we have to get it.
[02:45:28.730 --> 02:45:30.730]  Not only that, what do we do about it now?
[02:45:30.730 --> 02:45:34.730]  That's why we come back to Red Pill Expo and Red Pill University.
[02:45:35.730 --> 02:45:41.730]  That is my idea of how we can prevent this kind of chaos and defeat.
[02:45:41.730 --> 02:45:43.730]  We have to build our own movements.
[02:45:43.730 --> 02:45:47.730]  We have to build from the bottom up, not from the top down.
[02:45:47.730 --> 02:45:49.730]  You don't build a movement from the top down.
[02:45:49.730 --> 02:45:51.730]  You build it from the bottom up.
[02:45:51.730 --> 02:45:52.730]  That's the way our enemy has done it.
[02:45:52.730 --> 02:45:54.730]  Look around you.
[02:45:54.730 --> 02:46:03.730]  Every place, every little town you go into, every community you go into, you've got Black Lives Matter or Antifa or some other organization already there.
[02:46:03.730 --> 02:46:07.730]  They're on the job 24 hours a day, seven days a week and so forth.
[02:46:07.730 --> 02:46:09.730]  And we're just saying, who are you going to vote for?
[02:46:09.730 --> 02:46:11.730]  You know, it's not that easy.
[02:46:11.730 --> 02:46:13.730]  Guys, do me a favor. I'm cooking food.
[02:46:13.730 --> 02:46:15.730]  I skipped a break. Was somebody turning the stove off?
[02:46:17.730 --> 02:46:20.730]  G. Edward, I had my button still punched up.
[02:46:20.730 --> 02:46:22.730]  I was cooking my lunch in the thing and had it turned off.
[02:46:22.730 --> 02:46:25.730]  I skipped the break, so I said, hey guys, go turn my lunch off in the oven.
[02:46:25.730 --> 02:46:27.730]  Sorry, that's how real this all is.
[02:46:27.730 --> 02:46:29.730]  I forgot to eat breakfast.
[02:46:30.730 --> 02:46:38.730]  So G. Edward, you sound extremely positive about the world if people will recognize the pitfalls and the enemy traps.
[02:46:38.730 --> 02:46:40.730]  So that's what you've written about. That's what you've exposed.
[02:46:40.730 --> 02:46:43.730]  You've got the Real Red Pill Expo, redpillexpo.org.
[02:46:43.730 --> 02:46:46.730]  What else can people read and do to understand this?
[02:46:48.730 --> 02:46:56.730]  Well, golly, if you want to come to our website, our website where we sell books and recordings, all the information is there.
[02:46:56.730 --> 02:46:59.730]  And that is realityzone.com.
[02:46:59.730 --> 02:47:05.730]  You'll find plenty of stuff to read and plenty of videos to see and audio tapes to listen to.
[02:47:05.730 --> 02:47:09.730]  It's all there. But you know, you don't need to plow through it all.
[02:47:09.730 --> 02:47:12.730]  It doesn't take long to get the picture.
[02:47:12.730 --> 02:47:17.730]  The hardest part is knowing who you can trust and what you do about it.
[02:47:17.730 --> 02:47:22.730]  And I'm talking now about strategies and tactics, which most people don't talk about.
[02:47:22.730 --> 02:47:25.730]  They just think, well, if we just get together, somehow it'll happen.
[02:47:25.730 --> 02:47:28.730]  No, it won't just happen because they'll subvert it.
[02:47:28.730 --> 02:47:31.730]  They'll make sure that you do the wrong things instead of the right things.
[02:47:31.730 --> 02:47:33.730]  And that's what you teach. We'll have you back soon.
[02:47:33.730 --> 02:47:37.730]  You've been hard to get on to talk about a whole hour of strategy, two hours of strategy.
[02:47:37.730 --> 02:47:39.730]  We'll do a commercial free show if you want to get millions of views.
[02:47:39.730 --> 02:47:43.730]  But I don't get how people go against their own interest.
[02:47:43.730 --> 02:47:46.730]  And so you're saying you're optimistic.
[02:47:46.730 --> 02:47:53.730]  I can't imagine the average leftist wanting to be injected with a shot that makes them sick and doesn't protect them.
[02:47:53.730 --> 02:47:57.730]  Would LeBron James' son having a heart attack after he took it and all the rest of the death?
[02:47:57.730 --> 02:48:02.730]  I just don't see how do people go against their own interest like this?
[02:48:02.730 --> 02:48:06.730]  Well, that's a good question. I think that's different for each person.
[02:48:06.730 --> 02:48:09.730]  I don't really know the answer to that question because I tend to agree with you.
[02:48:09.730 --> 02:48:13.730]  But I think the answer must be in one or two areas.
[02:48:13.730 --> 02:48:16.730]  First of all, they don't realize it's against their own interest.
[02:48:16.730 --> 02:48:22.730]  Somehow they're still believing the propaganda that, well, you know, this really is good for the greater number.
[02:48:22.730 --> 02:48:27.730]  And maybe it won't hurt me. I mean, maybe I will be damaged by it.
[02:48:27.730 --> 02:48:29.730]  But it's for the greater number. And I'm a good person.
[02:48:29.730 --> 02:48:34.730]  And I believe in what is best for the greater number, even if I have to sacrifice myself.
[02:48:34.730 --> 02:48:38.730]  There's a lot of that going on, you know, self deceiving logic.
[02:48:38.730 --> 02:48:47.730]  And the other thing is that they don't really know what to do about it because if they violate that and they go against it like we do,
[02:48:47.730 --> 02:48:51.730]  they might lose their jobs or their prestige or their chance for promotion.
[02:48:51.730 --> 02:48:57.730]  Sure. And if we beat this collectivism this time, how many times does it come back like cancer?
[02:48:57.730 --> 02:49:02.730]  Because it just comes back and back and, oh, we haven't done, I went and saw Oppenheimer.
[02:49:02.730 --> 02:49:06.730]  It's a big communist apology movie, just disgusting.
[02:49:06.730 --> 02:49:09.730]  It's like they never stop. They just love it.
[02:49:09.730 --> 02:49:13.730]  Well, of course, they have a motive to it because they want to be rulers of the world.
[02:49:13.730 --> 02:49:16.730]  I mean, if you've got that instinct, you were talking about it before.
[02:49:16.730 --> 02:49:28.730]  If you've got that kind of instinct, a little sadism in your mind, you don't mind ruling over other people and having them thrown at your feet as slaves.
[02:49:28.730 --> 02:49:32.730]  If that thrills you and it's like pulling wings off of butterflies or something like that.
[02:49:32.730 --> 02:49:36.730]  Well, that's why they keep coming back, because that's life to them.
[02:49:36.730 --> 02:49:41.730]  And they're the ones that just spend all their time gravitating into government.
[02:49:42.730 --> 02:49:48.730]  Whereas the people like you and I, we don't want to run people's lives. We don't want to run any politics.
[02:49:48.730 --> 02:49:51.730]  Politics, I hate politicians. I don't have time for that stuff.
[02:49:51.730 --> 02:49:55.730]  Because we're already complete. We have God, we have success, we have love.
[02:49:55.730 --> 02:49:59.730]  We don't want to run people's lives, but they do. So there's the paradox.
[02:49:59.730 --> 02:50:09.730]  How do we get good men and women to realize if we don't take control and lead, not from a position of tyranny, from leadership, we will basically aid evil.
[02:50:09.730 --> 02:50:17.730]  We have a responsibility to learn how this works and to confront evil and to push it out of the political space.
[02:50:18.730 --> 02:50:22.730]  Well, we just have to say it and then we have to show that what happens if we don't do it.
[02:50:22.730 --> 02:50:29.730]  And all of a sudden, the smart runs among us and we'll say, I get it. It's enlightened self-interest.
[02:50:29.730 --> 02:50:37.730]  I've got to do this if I want to survive and protect my family and my children and all the people in the world that I don't even know about.
[02:50:37.730 --> 02:50:38.730]  I've got to do this.
[02:50:38.730 --> 02:50:49.730]  That's right. The average Christian or conservative, whether they're black, white, Hispanic, Asian, old, young, is very low-key, doesn't want power, already feels successful, feels confident.
[02:50:49.730 --> 02:50:56.730]  And it feels weird to want to be the mayor or the governor and like, oh, that's like what people on power trips want.
[02:50:56.730 --> 02:51:03.730]  But no, no, we have to do that or evil takes the space. We have a responsibility. It is a burden. We've got to take it.
[02:51:04.730 --> 02:51:11.730]  Yes, absolutely correct. And that's why I have created this thing called the Red Pill University and the Red Pill campuses,
[02:51:11.730 --> 02:51:18.730]  because the campuses we have, we're trying to build one in every county in the United States right now, a little campus.
[02:51:18.730 --> 02:51:24.730]  Well, what is that? It's a group of people. Maybe it's a small group, probably no larger than 60 people.
[02:51:24.730 --> 02:51:30.730]  But, you know, if you get 60 people working together, what they can accomplish, it's just amazing.
[02:51:30.730 --> 02:51:37.730]  I discovered over the years that they're in organizational work, that there's a mathematical formula at work.
[02:51:37.730 --> 02:51:44.730]  You get two people working independently side by side. They will accomplish the effect of two people.
[02:51:44.730 --> 02:51:52.730]  But you cooperate together. You multiply that and you've got two times two or four.
[02:51:52.730 --> 02:51:58.730]  Two people working together will accomplish the equivalent of four people working separately.
[02:51:58.730 --> 02:52:06.730]  And if you have three people working together, they will accomplish as much as nine people working separately and so on.
[02:52:06.730 --> 02:52:13.730]  So you figure 60 times 60 people. This is what you can you can over not overpower,
[02:52:13.730 --> 02:52:20.730]  but you can match the effect of 60 times 60 people if you get organized and work together.
[02:52:20.730 --> 02:52:29.730]  With this kind of poverty in a local community, say the county size, you can be very influential in seeing who is on, who runs for,
[02:52:29.730 --> 02:52:37.730]  and we're back to that, and is on the county board of supervisors, the city council, who is the mayor, who is the sheriff,
[02:52:37.730 --> 02:52:45.730]  you know, things like that. You can do it and you can determine who becomes the power centers
[02:52:45.730 --> 02:52:50.730]  and who controls the power centers or affects them at the local level.
[02:52:50.730 --> 02:52:56.730]  Now, once you have that in place, you can start to build toward the state level and then the national level.
[02:52:56.730 --> 02:53:00.730]  That's how our enemy has done it. And we just always want to start at the top.
[02:53:00.730 --> 02:53:03.730]  We're going to vote for president. How idiotic is that?
[02:53:03.730 --> 02:53:08.730]  Well, that's what the left always says. Think global, act local. You just said it.
[02:53:08.730 --> 02:53:15.730]  If we had 60 people in every county investigating candidates, speaking out, being at press conferences,
[02:53:15.730 --> 02:53:20.730]  being at city council, speaking out at school boards, that group would organize everybody else
[02:53:20.730 --> 02:53:24.730]  and we would, at the cellular level, take the country back like the communists have done.
[02:53:24.730 --> 02:53:27.730]  I mean, you're right. It's right there.
[02:53:27.730 --> 02:53:34.730]  You just said it, Alex. You said it in fewer words by far than I. That's exactly the only thing I would add to it,
[02:53:34.730 --> 02:53:39.730]  is that once we get together, we have to be darn sure we know what we believe in.
[02:53:39.730 --> 02:53:43.730]  If we're going to oppose collectivism, then what do we advocate?
[02:53:43.730 --> 02:53:48.730]  Are we just going to be against collectivism? Don't we have something positive of our own that we can boast about?
[02:53:48.730 --> 02:53:51.730]  And yes, we do. It's called individualism.
[02:53:51.730 --> 02:53:58.730]  And we have to become masters at knowing what that is and what the differences are so we can become teachers of it.
[02:53:58.730 --> 02:54:06.730]  Now, once we get our own ideology clear in our minds, then everything is in place and there will be no stopping us.
[02:54:06.730 --> 02:54:10.730]  That's what we're working on with Red Pill University and Red Pill campuses.
[02:54:10.730 --> 02:54:16.730]  Everybody should get behind it. The limited time we have left, you talked about,
[02:54:16.730 --> 02:54:20.730]  hey, don't give me attention. There were all these other great folks. I just learned how to make movies.
[02:54:20.730 --> 02:54:24.730]  And so I reached the most people ever that led to the movement we have now.
[02:54:24.730 --> 02:54:32.730]  I mean, you're like, I'd say half the success we've got now, you can go back to you 40, 56 years ago, creating that chain reaction.
[02:54:32.730 --> 02:54:38.730]  And obviously my work later had a big chain reaction as well. But I go back to the original source.
[02:54:38.730 --> 02:54:48.730]  What does the average person need to know about the movement now and where human liberty is and how important they are?
[02:54:48.730 --> 02:54:51.730]  Because you've done incredible things. That's a brief question.
[02:54:51.730 --> 02:55:00.730]  And another question that will be five more minutes the next hour is you talked about all those great folks that weren't known, but that did a great job early on.
[02:55:00.730 --> 02:55:04.730]  And it's not about credit, but it's about who are some of these amazing people?
[02:55:04.730 --> 02:55:07.730]  Maybe you can do some research, remember who they are, write some notes.
[02:55:07.730 --> 02:55:12.730]  But I'd love to have you back and talk about the unsung heroes of the movement against the New World War.
[02:55:12.730 --> 02:55:19.730]  Yeah, I would like to do that because there are a lot of those people, the people I looked up to, the people I admired,
[02:55:19.730 --> 02:55:25.730]  the people I learned from, and one comes to mind, Dan Smoot.
[02:55:25.730 --> 02:55:34.730]  Dan Smoot was a former FBI agent that left so that he could begin to communicate and spread the word about what he'd learned.
[02:55:34.730 --> 02:55:41.730]  And he started doing a Dan Smoot report, printed a newsletter every week, I think it was,
[02:55:41.730 --> 02:55:47.730]  and a little documentary film or statement, not documentary, but a motivational film.
[02:55:47.730 --> 02:55:54.730]  And I subscribe to his newsletters, and I think I still have every one of them in my library.
[02:55:54.730 --> 02:55:58.730]  I bound them, I thought so much of them, I bound them into binders.
[02:55:58.730 --> 02:56:08.730]  And I admire the fact that he was so meticulous in his ability to research original sources that everything he said was proven,
[02:56:08.730 --> 02:56:17.730]  absolutely proven, not by people who agreed with him, but by the people who were doing the things that he was talking about.
[02:56:17.730 --> 02:56:25.730]  So he didn't rely on other commentators to be a commentator, he relied on the original actors themselves.
[02:56:25.730 --> 02:56:34.730]  So there you go. I sort of thought of Dan Smoot when I wrote the foreword, I think it was the foreword to The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:56:34.730 --> 02:56:50.730]  I said, a lot of this information is unbelievable. It's sort of like if the village nitwit approached you saying that the bell had fallen from the tower, you might wonder if that was true or not.
[02:56:50.730 --> 02:57:00.730]  However, if he arrived dragging the bell behind him, well, so that's how Dan Smoot taught me that.
[02:57:00.730 --> 02:57:06.730]  He was always dragging the bell behind him, and I thought, golly, that's the way I want to be.
[02:57:06.730 --> 02:57:13.730]  So naturally, when you come to a book like Creature from Jekyll Island, it's got a lot of footnotes and original sources.
[02:57:13.730 --> 02:57:17.730]  Absolutely. Gee, Edward, I am so glad you're back. I love you to death.
[02:57:17.730 --> 02:57:23.730]  Your expo's coming up early next month on the 12th, 13th, Des Moines, Iowa, redpillexpo.org.
[02:57:23.730 --> 02:57:26.730]  Get your tickets while you still can. Join me again soon.
[02:57:26.730 --> 02:57:33.730]  We love you. We appreciate you. Dr. Peter McCullough's coming up on LeBron James' son having this heart attack that's going to really wake folks up.
[02:57:33.730 --> 02:57:36.730]  Thank you so much, G. Edward. We love you and we appreciate you.
[02:57:36.730 --> 02:57:43.730]  Alex, thank you. And you are going to be one of those people whose work will reverberate far into the future too.
[02:57:43.730 --> 02:57:44.730]  So it's a good place to be.
[02:57:44.730 --> 02:57:45.730]  God bless you.
[02:57:46.730 --> 02:57:52.730]  We finally have our original best selling colloidal silver back in stock.
[02:57:52.730 --> 02:58:02.730]  With the supply chain breakdowns and all the problems of the economy, we could not get the highest quality colloidal silver for almost three years back in stock.
[02:58:02.730 --> 02:58:07.730]  But now we've got it. 30 parts per million from the top lab. We've got a limited shipment.
[02:58:07.730 --> 02:58:09.730]  Hopefully we'll have a lot of it in the future.
[02:58:09.730 --> 02:58:18.730]  But if you want to experience and have in your medicine cabinet, have in your preparedness arsenal high quality colloidal silver from the best manufacturer,
[02:58:18.730 --> 02:58:24.730]  we have it right now private labeled under the name Silver Bullet at infowarstore.com.
[02:58:24.730 --> 02:58:30.730]  Limited supply, 30% off, infowarstore.com Silver Bullet.

[02:58:46.730 --> 02:58:51.730]  Infowarstore.com is like a grocery store or like a vitamin shop.
[02:58:51.730 --> 02:58:55.730]  We want to have all the best brands. We want to have a bunch of different choices for you.
[02:58:55.730 --> 02:59:02.730]  So I get constant questions online and in person. Hey, what's better? Knock out. What's better? Down and out. What's better?
[02:59:02.730 --> 02:59:04.730]  Why don't you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[02:59:04.730 --> 02:59:09.730]  And the answer is different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[02:59:09.730 --> 02:59:13.730]  So one person might like this coffee. Another person likes that coffee.
[02:59:13.730 --> 02:59:16.730]  That's how our bodies work. They're all very diverse.
[02:59:16.730 --> 02:59:22.730]  But we've been able to private label a national best seller that's been sold for many years that people love
[02:59:22.730 --> 02:59:27.730]  and sell for a lower price under the name Infowars MD Good Night Sleep.
[02:59:27.730 --> 02:59:33.730]  This is a great formula full of amazing safe compounds to give you deeper, cleaner, restful sleep.
[02:59:33.730 --> 02:59:37.730]  And it's in stock, available right now, of 25% off out of the gates.

[02:59:42.730 --> 03:00:02.730]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:02.730 --> 03:00:06.730]  All right. We already had an incredible broadcast today.
[03:00:06.730 --> 03:00:09.730]  Peter McCullough is taking care of a patient right now and can't get away to come on the show.
[03:00:09.730 --> 03:00:12.730]  We totally understand.
[03:00:12.730 --> 03:00:17.730]  Ron James' son, Ronnie's had a big heart attack and we're taking the shot.
[03:00:17.730 --> 03:00:20.730]  They're just trying to normalize that, hey, kids have heart attacks. It's normal.
[03:00:20.730 --> 03:00:23.730]  Young people never happened before, but it's the new normal.
[03:00:23.730 --> 03:00:29.730]  They're murdering us and we're smart enough to say it's wrong and say no to the system.
[03:00:29.730 --> 03:00:32.730]  So I'm going to have the next guest. Let's go ahead and just take over.
[03:00:32.730 --> 03:00:42.730]  I'm not going to try to get Dr. Peter McCullough on. We'll get him on tomorrow on the Wednesday transmission.
[03:00:42.730 --> 03:00:44.730]  One interview with G. Edward Griffin.
[03:00:44.730 --> 03:00:48.730]  But look at these memes I've got. Boy, these really say it all.
[03:00:48.730 --> 03:00:56.730]  So before the next guest host takes over, I'm going to go ahead and go over all this.
[03:00:56.730 --> 03:00:59.730]  They're going to be covering LeBron James' son and the rest of it.
[03:00:59.730 --> 03:01:02.730]  The rest of it. They've got Renz, the lawyer, coming on.
[03:01:02.730 --> 03:01:06.730]  Why isn't China concerned about global warming?
[03:01:06.730 --> 03:01:09.730]  Why do they build all these coal power plants and all the rest of it?
[03:01:09.730 --> 03:01:12.730]  Because they already have a communist government.
[03:01:12.730 --> 03:01:18.730]  That really takes the cake right there.
[03:01:18.730 --> 03:01:22.730]  The outside's role of billionaires in charting the path of climate.
[03:01:22.730 --> 03:01:25.730]  Washington Post, Jeff Bezos' organization.
[03:01:25.730 --> 03:01:30.730]  Oh! And here's Henry Kissinger that set up Communist China.
[03:01:30.730 --> 03:01:35.730]  When he set up Communist China, they needed to have running water and 90% of the country were electricity.
[03:01:35.730 --> 03:01:40.730]  But now they dominate us. Totally sold out authoritarianism because they made a deal to enslave their people.
[03:01:40.730 --> 03:01:43.730]  Shame on Henry Kissinger.
[03:01:43.730 --> 03:01:46.730]  These photos are 100 years apart.
[03:01:46.730 --> 03:01:51.730]  I'm saddened by the realization that rising sea levels are going to kill us all.
[03:01:51.730 --> 03:01:56.730]  Sea level is exactly the same.
[03:01:56.730 --> 03:01:59.730]  Polar bear's populations are bigger than ever.
[03:01:59.730 --> 03:02:03.730]  They hunt on ice packs. They're not on the last piece of ice dying.
[03:02:03.730 --> 03:02:07.730]  It's all a hoax. It's all a lie.
[03:02:07.730 --> 03:02:10.730]  Over and over and over again.
[03:02:10.730 --> 03:02:17.730]  I ask you, will you commit Russian roulette for the system?
[03:02:17.730 --> 03:02:19.730]  Will you take that shot?
[03:02:19.730 --> 03:02:22.730]  Half the time it's saline. 40% of the time it's low dose.
[03:02:22.730 --> 03:02:25.730]  10% of the time it's a death sentence.
[03:02:25.730 --> 03:02:27.730]  It's all part of their sick game.
[03:02:27.730 --> 03:02:29.730]  All part of their power trip.
[03:02:29.730 --> 03:02:31.730]  They look at us and they hate us.
[03:02:31.730 --> 03:02:37.730]  I say we get organized and awake to who they are and we take the world back and we stop them now.
[03:02:37.730 --> 03:02:39.730]  We're not offering some perfect utopia.
[03:02:39.730 --> 03:02:41.730]  I'm not a liar. I wouldn't tell you that like they do.
[03:02:41.730 --> 03:02:43.730]  But I'll sure as hell tell you this.
[03:02:43.730 --> 03:02:46.730]  It won't be run by a bunch of people out to get you.
[03:02:46.730 --> 03:02:50.730]  Because there's a parallel. All this wealth. All this freedom. All this medicine.
[03:02:50.730 --> 03:02:53.730]  All the good things is because there were some good people running things.
[03:02:53.730 --> 03:02:56.730]  And the parasites snuck into it and took over.
[03:02:56.730 --> 03:02:59.730]  It's actually very easy to beat these people.
[03:02:59.730 --> 03:03:02.730]  But you've got to admit evil exists.
[03:03:02.730 --> 03:03:05.730]  And you've got to admit they're attacking you or you have no hope.
[03:03:05.730 --> 03:03:08.730]  So I covered three stacks out of about 20 today.
[03:03:08.730 --> 03:03:11.730]  And I'm going to try tomorrow when I'm back to hit it all.
[03:03:11.730 --> 03:03:13.730]  But I'll do the best job I can.
[03:03:13.730 --> 03:03:18.730]  It goes up in about 57 minutes. Not about exactly 57 minutes.
[03:03:18.730 --> 03:03:26.730]  Maria Z takes over with a great lawyer who's been one of the main people exposing this attorney Wrens.
[03:03:26.730 --> 03:03:28.730]  So look for that.
[03:03:28.730 --> 03:03:30.730]  The latest on Bronny James.
[03:03:30.730 --> 03:03:36.730]  And then also remember that I'm not going to shut down willingly and I'm not saying we're going away.
[03:03:36.730 --> 03:03:39.730]  But there's about a 20% chance we won't be here in a few months.
[03:03:39.730 --> 03:03:40.730]  I'm being honest with you.
[03:03:40.730 --> 03:03:46.730]  So if you want an Infowars T-shirt, you want to get storeable foods, you want water filters, you want supplements, you should get them now.
[03:03:46.730 --> 03:03:50.730]  Because I'm not sitting here playing games.
[03:03:50.730 --> 03:03:53.730]  I'm up against the CIA, the New World Order, the whole nine yards.
[03:03:53.730 --> 03:03:55.730]  And I'm very calm in the middle of the storm.
[03:03:55.730 --> 03:03:56.730]  God's in charge.
[03:03:56.730 --> 03:03:58.730]  I asked for this.
[03:03:58.730 --> 03:04:02.730]  I'm very honored to not be a Satanist, pedophile, devil worshiper.
[03:04:02.730 --> 03:04:05.730]  And so I'm on God's team and that means I get destroyed.
[03:04:05.730 --> 03:04:07.730]  I'm ready for it.
[03:04:07.730 --> 03:04:10.730]  Solitary confinement, tortured death, whole nine yards.
[03:04:10.730 --> 03:04:11.730]  I'm signed on.
[03:04:11.730 --> 03:04:12.730]  Don't particularly want it.
[03:04:12.730 --> 03:04:14.730]  But if it's going to happen, let's just get it going.
[03:04:14.730 --> 03:04:18.730]  The point is it's not the enemy that can shut us down, though.
[03:04:18.730 --> 03:04:19.730]  It's you.
[03:04:19.730 --> 03:04:21.730]  I need you to spread the word about the show.
[03:04:21.730 --> 03:04:22.730]  I need you to pray for the broadcast.
[03:04:22.730 --> 03:04:24.730]  I need you to buy products that you already need.
[03:04:24.730 --> 03:04:27.730]  Go now to Infowarsstore.com.
[03:04:27.730 --> 03:04:29.730]  Take advantage of the big sale that's going on.
[03:04:29.730 --> 03:04:30.730]  We've got great products.
[03:04:30.730 --> 03:04:31.730]  I'm counting on you.
[03:04:31.730 --> 03:04:32.730]  All right.
[03:04:32.730 --> 03:04:33.730]  Great job with the crew.
[03:04:33.730 --> 03:04:35.730]  Maria Z takes over.
[03:04:35.730 --> 03:04:37.730]  And then Owen Troyer.
[03:04:37.730 --> 03:04:39.730]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:04:39.730 --> 03:04:40.730]  Tomorrow's news today.
[03:04:40.730 --> 03:04:41.730]  This is the real world.
[03:04:41.730 --> 03:04:42.730]  This isn't Hollywood.
[03:04:42.730 --> 03:04:44.730]  This isn't fantasy land.
[03:04:44.730 --> 03:04:52.730]  This is the new world order trying to take control of your body and inject you with prions that basically give you mad cow disease if you're lucky.
[03:04:52.730 --> 03:04:54.730]  Stay with us.
[03:05:05.730 --> 03:05:13.730]  Iodine techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[03:05:13.730 --> 03:05:16.730]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[03:05:16.730 --> 03:05:19.730]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[03:05:19.730 --> 03:05:28.730]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[03:05:28.730 --> 03:05:38.730]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface.
[03:05:38.730 --> 03:05:44.730]  Our Infowars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[03:05:44.730 --> 03:05:53.730]  Pure nascent iodine stabilized in an activated triiodine form for a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism.
[03:05:53.730 --> 03:05:57.730]  Get yours now at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:05:58.730 --> 03:06:03.730]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:03.730 --> 03:06:06.730]  I'm your guest host, Maria Z from zmedia.com.
[03:06:06.730 --> 03:06:13.730]  We are joined today by attorney Tom Renz, freedom fighter, patriot and a truly, truly magnificent man.
[03:06:13.730 --> 03:06:15.730]  Tom, thank you so much for joining us.
[03:06:15.730 --> 03:06:17.730]  I'm excited to be with you, Maria.
[03:06:17.730 --> 03:06:18.730]  How are you?
[03:06:18.730 --> 03:06:19.730]  Good.
[03:06:19.730 --> 03:06:20.730]  Good.
[03:06:20.730 --> 03:06:21.730]  It's good to see you again, Tom.
[03:06:21.730 --> 03:06:29.730]  Well, we've got a lot to cover today, but one of the main things I want to talk to you about is this new unified ledger.
[03:06:29.730 --> 03:06:40.730]  If the people thought CBDCs were bad, Tom, they're about to get a real reality check on what this stuff actually means.
[03:06:40.730 --> 03:06:43.730]  And I know that you have a really good understanding about it.
[03:06:43.730 --> 03:06:48.730]  For reference, what we're talking about today, the plan found on bis.org.
[03:06:48.730 --> 03:06:53.730]  It's entitled Blueprint for the Future Monetary System, Improving the Old, Enabling the New.
[03:06:53.730 --> 03:06:58.730]  And I've heard Tom explain this so well in the past.
[03:06:58.730 --> 03:07:02.730]  So, Tom, I want to hand over to you and if you could just break this down for people,
[03:07:02.730 --> 03:07:06.730]  because actually before I do, over the past couple of years here in Australia,
[03:07:06.730 --> 03:07:12.730]  we've had people warning about the fact that land titles, house titles were being digitized
[03:07:12.730 --> 03:07:15.730]  and people were saying, you no longer own your house.
[03:07:15.730 --> 03:07:16.730]  It's owned by them.
[03:07:16.730 --> 03:07:20.730]  And people didn't really understand this at the time, but now it makes a lot of sense.
[03:07:20.730 --> 03:07:21.730]  Over to you, Tom.
[03:07:21.730 --> 03:07:28.730]  Yeah, so I mean, you've got to understand, Maria, that what this is about is control.
[03:07:28.730 --> 03:07:35.730]  So right now, if you want to go buy, I don't know, a gun in the United States,
[03:07:35.730 --> 03:07:43.730]  or if you want to go buy a pack of cigarettes, or I don't smoke, but whatever it is that you want to buy,
[03:07:43.730 --> 03:07:48.730]  you can take your cash money, you can go buy it, and no one can really stop you, right?
[03:07:48.730 --> 03:07:52.730]  Because it's my cash money, I can spend it where I want, and I can do what I want with it.
[03:07:52.730 --> 03:07:56.730]  And if someone else is willing to take my cash money for their product,
[03:07:56.730 --> 03:08:01.730]  well, it's between them and I, and there's no records, there's no anyone that can interfere with that.
[03:08:01.730 --> 03:08:04.730]  So CBDCs come along.
[03:08:04.730 --> 03:08:09.730]  Well, at that point, every transaction has to be approved by the computer,
[03:08:09.730 --> 03:08:15.730]  because for me to give you money, the computer has to transfer it from my spot to your spot, right?
[03:08:15.730 --> 03:08:17.730]  My account to your account.
[03:08:17.730 --> 03:08:24.730]  And so CBDCs make the purchase and exchange of goods something that's completely controllable.
[03:08:24.730 --> 03:08:28.730]  But, but, but, but, there's a big hole there, right?
[03:08:28.730 --> 03:08:31.730]  Because what about things you already own?
[03:08:31.730 --> 03:08:33.730]  What about assets?
[03:08:33.730 --> 03:08:38.730]  What about, you know, well, I buy a house, and I pay it off, and now it's mine.
[03:08:38.730 --> 03:08:44.730]  Well, what happens there is, you know, that's on a ledger for a period of time,
[03:08:44.730 --> 03:08:48.730]  but then you've got this deed, and the deed is recorded somewhere.
[03:08:48.730 --> 03:08:53.730]  And in the United States, the deed is recorded at a county courthouse, usually,
[03:08:53.730 --> 03:08:58.730]  and it's literally a piece of paper that has a, you know, a list of who owns what where.
[03:08:58.730 --> 03:09:03.730]  Well, what they want to do now is they want to, just like with CBDCs,
[03:09:03.730 --> 03:09:06.730]  they want to digitize so everything goes through the computer,
[03:09:06.730 --> 03:09:13.730]  they want to essentially digitize those deeds and put them all in one spot on what they call a unified ledger.
[03:09:13.730 --> 03:09:20.730]  And that unified ledger would basically be a recording of who owns what all over the place, right, everything.
[03:09:20.730 --> 03:09:25.730]  And it would be the de facto spot to go to to demonstrate or prove ownership.
[03:09:25.730 --> 03:09:31.730]  So, what happens then is much like CBDCs, with CBDCs, they can say,
[03:09:31.730 --> 03:09:34.730]  no, you can't go buy a gun, we don't think that's okay.
[03:09:34.730 --> 03:09:40.730]  Or, if I want to buy a gun, yeah, we have the Second Amendment in the United States,
[03:09:40.730 --> 03:09:45.730]  so you can buy a gun, but we're going to tax guns at 900%,
[03:09:45.730 --> 03:09:48.730]  or we're going to tax bullets at 1000%.
[03:09:48.730 --> 03:09:54.730]  And since you already have a gun, we could put it in a real complex tax system
[03:09:54.730 --> 03:09:57.730]  where we can disincentivize you, right?
[03:09:57.730 --> 03:10:04.730]  So, if you want to buy, I don't know, one box of candy a week, that's fine,
[03:10:04.730 --> 03:10:08.730]  but if you want to buy one box of candy a day, that could make you fat,
[03:10:08.730 --> 03:10:15.730]  so we're going to have each box of candy cost more because the tax rate goes up on each box of candy.
[03:10:15.730 --> 03:10:19.730]  So, they can control what you buy and don't buy by changing these tax rates,
[03:10:19.730 --> 03:10:24.730]  and that can only be done with a very complex AI-type system.
[03:10:24.730 --> 03:10:29.730]  But the AI-type system doesn't work unless they can track and control everything.
[03:10:29.730 --> 03:10:33.730]  So, they control this stuff that way using CBDCs,
[03:10:33.730 --> 03:10:38.730]  but the problem is that doesn't give them control over what you already own.
[03:10:38.730 --> 03:10:41.730]  Enter the unified ledger, right?
[03:10:41.730 --> 03:10:47.730]  Now, the unified ledger lets them say, you know, you've been really uncompliant,
[03:10:47.730 --> 03:10:51.730]  so you're going to have to pay a lot more in property taxes this year.
[03:10:51.730 --> 03:10:55.730]  Oh, and since you can't afford that, we're going to just seize your house.
[03:10:55.730 --> 03:10:59.730]  That's now a government asset, and, well, you're out of luck, right?
[03:10:59.730 --> 03:11:04.730]  And there is no courthouse, there's no deeds, there's no protection, there's nothing.
[03:11:04.730 --> 03:11:07.730]  It's just literally the stroke of a pen.
[03:11:07.730 --> 03:11:10.730]  Or, as we've seen here recently, another, you know,
[03:11:10.730 --> 03:11:14.730]  and these are just theoretical examples, but they're examples.
[03:11:14.730 --> 03:11:16.730]  You know, we saw COVID, right?
[03:11:16.730 --> 03:11:18.730]  So, COVID comes along.
[03:11:18.730 --> 03:11:22.730]  And, oh, you haven't got your vaccine.
[03:11:22.730 --> 03:11:24.730]  Well, you're going to have a tax penalty.
[03:11:24.730 --> 03:11:26.730]  And if that means that we decide to take your house.
[03:11:26.730 --> 03:11:28.730]  Yeah, or you can't go here, or you can't eat,
[03:11:28.730 --> 03:11:32.730]  you can't go to access an essential service, for example, so on and so forth.
[03:11:32.730 --> 03:11:34.730]  Right, right.
[03:11:34.730 --> 03:11:39.730]  And then, as a penalty, if you don't, you know, you don't comply,
[03:11:39.730 --> 03:11:43.730]  well, it's real easy for the central government authority, wherever that is,
[03:11:43.730 --> 03:11:46.730]  to just take your house, or take this, or take that.
[03:11:46.730 --> 03:11:48.730]  It's just the stroke of a pen.
[03:11:48.730 --> 03:11:51.730]  So, what the unified ledger does is it rounds out CBDCs
[03:11:51.730 --> 03:11:55.730]  to ensure that the control of everything that we do is complete.
[03:11:55.730 --> 03:11:59.730]  Everything's on a computer, the computer decides what you own,
[03:11:59.730 --> 03:12:02.730]  what you have, what you can buy, what you do,
[03:12:02.730 --> 03:12:06.730]  and everything is a matter of social engineering.
[03:12:06.730 --> 03:12:09.730]  So, we lose all freedom, all privacy,
[03:12:09.730 --> 03:12:12.730]  and any sort of individual rights that we've ever had.
[03:12:12.730 --> 03:12:16.730]  I want to read, Mike Adams wrote a really fantastic article on this,
[03:12:16.730 --> 03:12:18.730]  and I want to quote from the article.
[03:12:18.730 --> 03:12:21.730]  So, here is quoting from the paper that I referenced before.
[03:12:21.730 --> 03:12:24.730]  It says, a new type of financial market infrastructure,
[03:12:24.730 --> 03:12:28.730]  a unified ledger, could capture the full benefits of tokenization
[03:12:28.730 --> 03:12:31.730]  by combining central bank money, tokenized deposits,
[03:12:31.730 --> 03:12:35.730]  and tokenized assets on a programmable platform, end quote.
[03:12:35.730 --> 03:12:39.730]  The BIS document goes on to state that all tokenized assets
[03:12:39.730 --> 03:12:42.730]  can be subjected to regulatory rules set by governments,
[03:12:42.730 --> 03:12:46.730]  which means this could include regulations involving speech,
[03:12:46.730 --> 03:12:50.730]  climate change, acceptance of mutilating children,
[03:12:50.730 --> 03:12:53.730]  conformity to vaccine demands, and so on.
[03:12:53.730 --> 03:12:55.730]  Again, from the paper, quote,
[03:12:55.730 --> 03:12:59.730]  this dual nature of tokens could be used to good effect
[03:12:59.730 --> 03:13:01.730]  in a supervisory and compliance setting
[03:13:01.730 --> 03:13:06.730]  by directly embedding supervisory features into the token itself,
[03:13:06.730 --> 03:13:08.730]  which can be tailored to specific rules.
[03:13:08.730 --> 03:13:13.730]  So, what you're describing, Tom, you're describing the control mechanism,
[03:13:13.730 --> 03:13:17.730]  but I think people may not really understand how this happens technically.
[03:13:17.730 --> 03:13:21.730]  So, with the CBDC, they say they can program it to expire,
[03:13:21.730 --> 03:13:25.730]  to only be able to be used for things that won't affect the climate
[03:13:25.730 --> 03:13:29.730]  or whatever, or aren't, you know, promoting inequality,
[03:13:29.730 --> 03:13:32.730]  whatever the woke agenda of the day is.
[03:13:32.730 --> 03:13:35.730]  This is the same thing with digital assets,
[03:13:35.730 --> 03:13:39.730]  except how far can they actually go, Tom, from a legal perspective,
[03:13:39.730 --> 03:13:43.730]  can they seize your house if you say the wrong thing?
[03:13:43.730 --> 03:13:45.730]  Well, you see, here's the problem.
[03:13:45.730 --> 03:13:49.730]  First of all, that depends on the country, and this is going to be global.
[03:13:49.730 --> 03:13:52.730]  So, you guys down in Australia, you've got a different situation than us.
[03:13:52.730 --> 03:13:58.730]  Here in the U.S., what I expect they will do is they will say that,
[03:13:58.730 --> 03:14:01.730]  see, in the U.S., we've come so far,
[03:14:01.730 --> 03:14:04.730]  we've moved so far away from our Constitution
[03:14:04.730 --> 03:14:06.730]  that it's almost unrecognizable.
[03:14:06.730 --> 03:14:09.730]  So, they will use the Commerce Clause, they'll use these different things.
[03:14:09.730 --> 03:14:13.730]  They'll say, for example, global warming is having a huge financial impact,
[03:14:13.730 --> 03:14:15.730]  and under the Commerce Clause, they have the power to regulate.
[03:14:15.730 --> 03:14:18.730]  And then what they'll do is they'll put a sliding scale on it, right?
[03:14:18.730 --> 03:14:23.730]  So, you've got to pay more taxes if you're doing some, you know,
[03:14:23.730 --> 03:14:26.730]  the more gas you use, the higher tax it is, right?
[03:14:26.730 --> 03:14:28.730]  So, they aren't going to say you can't use gas.
[03:14:28.730 --> 03:14:31.730]  They're going to say the more that you use, the higher the tax, right?
[03:14:32.730 --> 03:14:35.730]  They're not going to say that you can't buy a gun.
[03:14:35.730 --> 03:14:38.730]  They're going to say that the tax rate on a gun is 9 million percent.
[03:14:38.730 --> 03:14:43.730]  They're not going to say that you can't, you know, buy a pickup truck.
[03:14:43.730 --> 03:14:45.730]  They're going to say that if you buy a pickup truck,
[03:14:45.730 --> 03:14:48.730]  the tax rate's higher than something else.
[03:14:48.730 --> 03:14:52.730]  I mean, so what they're going to do is they're going to not violate
[03:14:52.730 --> 03:14:55.730]  the plain language of the Constitution directly,
[03:14:55.730 --> 03:14:58.730]  but they're going to violate the meaning of it
[03:14:58.730 --> 03:15:01.730]  under some of these interpretations that have occurred
[03:15:01.730 --> 03:15:03.730]  over the long history of our nation.
[03:15:03.730 --> 03:15:06.730]  And I expect this will happen in every country, right?
[03:15:06.730 --> 03:15:08.730]  Because what I've seen, and you know,
[03:15:08.730 --> 03:15:10.730]  I've had the great pleasure of talking to you
[03:15:10.730 --> 03:15:12.730]  and a lot of wonderful people down in Australia,
[03:15:12.730 --> 03:15:16.730]  a lot of people from Europe and even Africa and everywhere else,
[03:15:16.730 --> 03:15:20.730]  and what I've found is that the playbook is very similar.
[03:15:20.730 --> 03:15:25.730]  Where you have a strong constitution or a strong set of protected freedoms,
[03:15:25.730 --> 03:15:28.730]  what they do is they manipulate that, right?
[03:15:28.730 --> 03:15:31.730]  So I can't ban you from buying a gun in the United States
[03:15:31.730 --> 03:15:33.730]  because of the Second Amendment.
[03:15:33.730 --> 03:15:35.730]  What I can do is raise the tax rate on the gun
[03:15:35.730 --> 03:15:38.730]  to some absurd amount where no one can afford it.
[03:15:38.730 --> 03:15:39.730]  What I can do is...
[03:15:39.730 --> 03:15:41.730]  Let's talk about on the other side of the break, Tom,
[03:15:41.730 --> 03:15:45.730]  we're going to talk more about how they're practically going to do this,
[03:15:45.730 --> 03:15:49.730]  how this is going to affect the everyday person and their assets.
[03:15:49.730 --> 03:15:50.730]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:15:50.730 --> 03:15:52.730]  We'll be back with Tom Renz right after this break.
[03:15:56.730 --> 03:16:00.730]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had.
[03:16:00.730 --> 03:16:02.730]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:16:02.730 --> 03:16:06.730]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:16:06.730 --> 03:16:08.730]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars,
[03:16:08.730 --> 03:16:11.730]  people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[03:16:11.730 --> 03:16:15.730]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:16:15.730 --> 03:16:17.730]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer
[03:16:17.730 --> 03:16:20.730]  and the hard work they engage in every day,
[03:16:20.730 --> 03:16:24.730]  five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[03:16:24.730 --> 03:16:26.730]  So for myself and the whole Infowars crew,
[03:16:26.730 --> 03:16:28.730]  I thank you for your past support.
[03:16:28.730 --> 03:16:32.730]  I want to encourage you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air
[03:16:32.730 --> 03:16:34.730]  if you do not support us.
[03:16:34.730 --> 03:16:36.730]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us,
[03:16:36.730 --> 03:16:37.730]  and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[03:16:37.730 --> 03:16:41.730]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfowarsStore.com
[03:16:41.730 --> 03:16:44.730]  and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life
[03:16:44.730 --> 03:16:46.730]  while at the same time getting us on air.
[03:16:46.730 --> 03:16:48.730]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners
[03:16:48.730 --> 03:16:50.730]  actually go buy products at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:16:50.730 --> 03:16:53.730]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfowarsStore.com,
[03:16:53.730 --> 03:16:55.730]  our funding problems will be over.
[03:16:55.730 --> 03:16:56.730]  Please take action now.

[03:19:57.730 --> 03:20:01.730]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[03:20:01.730 --> 03:20:03.730]  it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:05.800 --> 03:20:17.199]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. We are here with attorney Tom Brands talking about
[03:20:17.199 --> 03:20:23.880]  this new unified ledger announced by the Bank of International Settlements. This tokenization
[03:20:23.880 --> 03:20:27.759]  of your private assets, not the ones you're going to buy in the future, but the ones
[03:20:27.759 --> 03:20:34.400]  you already have, subjecting you to control measures to keep your property essentially.
[03:20:34.400 --> 03:20:40.439]  All financial assets being tokenized and controlled by this unified ledger with globalists altering
[03:20:40.439 --> 03:20:45.480]  this ledger at any time to take away your assets based on your social credit score. We're
[03:20:45.480 --> 03:20:49.960]  talking to Tom about how this would look practically. I can appreciate Tom that it's
[03:20:49.960 --> 03:20:55.480]  different in every country, but considering you're from the United States, how would
[03:20:55.480 --> 03:21:01.039]  this actually work practically in the US? Someone says something that the government
[03:21:01.039 --> 03:21:06.679]  doesn't like and they come and take their house. Is that possible?
[03:21:06.679 --> 03:21:14.679]  The question becomes when you think about that is not whether it's possible legally
[03:21:14.679 --> 03:21:20.039]  but whether it's possible practically. If you look at the Constitution of the United
[03:21:20.039 --> 03:21:27.519]  States, it is 100% clear that you cannot lock someone in their house under house arrest
[03:21:27.519 --> 03:21:32.599]  for 14 days to flatten an imaginary curve without at least some pretense that there's
[03:21:32.599 --> 03:21:37.039]  a legitimate virus or something going around that's going to kill everybody. There
[03:21:37.039 --> 03:21:42.080]  was no evidence whatsoever that flattening the curve was going to do anything, but yet
[03:21:42.080 --> 03:21:50.279]  they did it. Social distancing, shutting down businesses, the way that the law was
[03:21:50.279 --> 03:21:56.080]  unequally applied, there were a number of constitutional violations during COVID and
[03:21:56.080 --> 03:22:01.640]  they did it. I don't care how many times judges ruled that it was okay or not okay
[03:22:01.640 --> 03:22:05.679]  because there's an emergency. I frankly think they got it wrong and I'm entitled
[03:22:05.679 --> 03:22:10.960]  to that opinion as a lawyer. It's quite clear. There was no equal treatment
[03:22:10.960 --> 03:22:17.199]  under the law and the idea that there was an emergency and we made some mistakes,
[03:22:17.199 --> 03:22:21.960]  that's nonsense. Now, the court has started to fix that because they've recognized
[03:22:22.759 --> 03:22:28.199]  the truth of the COVID is starting to come out, that the Constitution doesn't take a
[03:22:28.199 --> 03:22:34.359]  break in an emergency. Now, the question will become, can they do that or can they
[03:22:34.359 --> 03:22:40.160]  convince the courts that that's okay when they come back again? This is why the COVID
[03:22:40.160 --> 03:22:44.359]  fight was so important and is still so important and why we're still fighting it,
[03:22:44.359 --> 03:22:50.519]  right? Because it ties in with CBDCs and Unified Ledger. From a practical perspective,
[03:22:50.560 --> 03:22:56.920]  if the people wake up and say, absolutely not, when this sort of thing happens, no,
[03:22:56.920 --> 03:23:01.880]  it won't work. If the people roll over and accept it because there's a whole other set
[03:23:01.880 --> 03:23:09.640]  of plandemic viruses or a whole other crisis of some type, we've heard everything that there
[03:23:09.640 --> 03:23:13.240]  is to hear. They're going to attack the internet and shut it down. We know they're
[03:23:13.240 --> 03:23:17.039]  attacking our banking systems, we know our financial system, we know our food system,
[03:23:17.039 --> 03:23:22.000]  our energy. We know all this stuff, right? The question isn't whether we're being attacked
[03:23:22.000 --> 03:23:26.039]  or whether they will attack or whether they will try to do this. The question is whether
[03:23:26.039 --> 03:23:30.160]  or not we, the people will roll over or will stand up and say to hell with you.
[03:23:30.160 --> 03:23:35.519]  Now, our rights are worth fighting for. I'll stand, I'll fight. I can tell you that for
[03:23:35.519 --> 03:23:39.000]  sure. I mean, there's no question what I'm going to do. You can see I've done it for
[03:23:39.000 --> 03:23:44.519]  three years. The question is what will the population do? But by waking people up to the
[03:23:44.519 --> 03:23:50.400]  fraud that was COVID, which we're doing on a very, very broad scale now, we are starting
[03:23:50.400 --> 03:23:54.679]  to wake people up to the fact that anything, why would you trust a liar, right? These
[03:23:54.679 --> 03:23:58.359]  people have lied nonstop for three years. Why would we continue to trust them? And
[03:23:58.359 --> 03:24:04.160]  so the way that I see this, Maria, is that we are essentially at a point now where
[03:24:04.160 --> 03:24:09.640]  we're in a foot race and the foot race is between people like me and Bobby Kennedy
[03:24:09.640 --> 03:24:15.160]  and Donald Trump and Clay Clark and General Flynn and all these guys who are trying to
[03:24:15.160 --> 03:24:20.800]  wake people up. And the other side that's trying to get their plans in place as quickly
[03:24:20.800 --> 03:24:26.000]  as possible to ignore the Constitution and to force us to fall into compliance. And
[03:24:26.000 --> 03:24:30.240]  essentially, if we can wake enough people up and make enough people ready to say, hell
[03:24:30.240 --> 03:24:35.519]  no, I will not roll over, I will not comply, I will follow the Constitution, I will
[03:24:35.519 --> 03:24:40.720]  stand for my rights and that's just that. We'll be okay. If we don't have enough people,
[03:24:40.720 --> 03:24:45.359]  we're going to lose the fight. And that's really what it comes down to. So this, you
[03:24:45.359 --> 03:24:48.759]  know, we'll continue fighting and we'll continue in the courts and we're going to continue
[03:24:48.759 --> 03:24:52.320]  everywhere else. But that's actually why I spend so much time doing shows like this.
[03:24:52.320 --> 03:24:57.199]  Because if we don't get the people aware, if we don't educate the population and wake
[03:24:57.199 --> 03:24:59.840]  the public up to what's occurring, the fight is lost.
[03:24:59.840 --> 03:25:06.480]  Absolutely agree with you, Tom. You can't fight your enemy unless you understand your enemy and
[03:25:06.480 --> 03:25:09.960]  know your enemy and know what you're fighting against. How can you battle without knowing
[03:25:09.960 --> 03:25:14.240]  what the battle is? This is exactly what Alex was saying in the last segment with his
[03:25:14.240 --> 03:25:19.640]  guest. You have to admit that evil exists. You have to start by admitting that evil exists
[03:25:19.640 --> 03:25:23.720]  and conceiving in your mind how far they can actually go. That's the purpose of these
[03:25:23.720 --> 03:25:28.759]  discussions. And so, you know, when we're talking about this, Tom, there may have been people
[03:25:29.039 --> 03:25:35.119]  that got injected to maintain their wealth, for example, and now I'm hearing people that,
[03:25:35.119 --> 03:25:39.920]  because people think, oh, it's not going to affect wealthy people. These plans are not going
[03:25:39.920 --> 03:25:45.759]  to affect wealthy people. They somehow separate it. You're absolutely wrong. And I know some
[03:25:45.759 --> 03:25:51.279]  people that are considerably wealthy that are starting to think, how are we going to get
[03:25:51.279 --> 03:25:55.560]  around this? I mean, this is coming for us all. They're starting to realize no one is
[03:25:55.560 --> 03:26:01.960]  immune to this. And once you start getting wealthy people aware of what is happening and they
[03:26:01.960 --> 03:26:07.560]  realize that they're not in the club either and they start talking with their money and they
[03:26:07.560 --> 03:26:13.119]  start talking with their platforms, you know, Ed Dowd spoke to me recently about a very
[03:26:13.119 --> 03:26:18.880]  important person, we can't name, but getting a hold of his book and being very angry about
[03:26:18.880 --> 03:26:23.359]  it. So when, you know, and this person is probably someone we would have thought was in
[03:26:23.359 --> 03:26:28.439]  the club and he realized he's not. So, you know, more and more people are starting to
[03:26:28.439 --> 03:26:33.480]  realize that they are going to be disadvantaged by this. They're not going to escape these
[03:26:33.480 --> 03:26:40.160]  control measures either. And so I think you've been crucial to that, Tom, and waking people
[03:26:40.160 --> 03:26:43.640]  up. I know we only have you for half an hour today. So on the other side of this
[03:26:43.640 --> 03:26:47.920]  break, I'm going to go into some of the ways that the other ways that they'll control
[03:26:47.920 --> 03:26:52.000]  people through CBDCs. But Tom, in the last couple of minutes, just let people know
[03:26:52.000 --> 03:26:55.039]  what do you think they really need to know and what do they need to be doing right now?
[03:26:55.039 --> 03:27:03.519]  Well, the key that you got to understand is that this is 5G warfare. This is it's
[03:27:03.519 --> 03:27:09.519]  about information. It's about control. It's about trying to force us into compliance. We
[03:27:09.519 --> 03:27:14.240]  the people run the world, whether it's Australia, whether it's United States, whether it's Canada,
[03:27:14.240 --> 03:27:19.279]  we the people are in charge. The government can only govern with the consent of the governed.
[03:27:20.000 --> 03:27:25.359]  We have the power to throw out our leadership. We have the power to reject what they're doing.
[03:27:25.359 --> 03:27:29.840]  The simple reality is that we the people just simply have to exercise that.
[03:27:29.840 --> 03:27:33.519]  Now, right now, we're doing everything we can to demonstrate
[03:27:34.400 --> 03:27:39.279]  that we will not accept this and we will stand against it as peacefully as possible.
[03:27:40.000 --> 03:27:46.320]  And that's the way that it's got to be. But ultimately, you cannot share this information
[03:27:46.320 --> 03:27:51.599]  enough. This is not disputable. Everything that I'm saying I can enter or have entered
[03:27:51.599 --> 03:27:56.800]  into court cases under penalty of perjury, under penalty of this, penalty of that.
[03:27:56.800 --> 03:28:02.560]  This stuff is not disputable. We've got the documents. This isn't conspiracy theory. I
[03:28:02.560 --> 03:28:08.400]  don't do maybe. I do evidence. It's either evidence or it's not. And if it's evidence,
[03:28:08.400 --> 03:28:12.480]  it is what it is. So we've got to get the word out. We need your help getting the word
[03:28:12.480 --> 03:28:17.519]  out. People don't understand. They think that when I say, hey, share our show on Infowars,
[03:28:17.519 --> 03:28:21.119]  share TomWrens.com, share this, share that. They think I'm doing that because I want to get
[03:28:21.119 --> 03:28:25.439]  a check. No, I'm doing it because if you don't get the information out there,
[03:28:25.439 --> 03:28:28.480]  if you don't share this interview, if you don't share what we know about the
[03:28:28.480 --> 03:28:34.720]  Unified Ledger and CBDCs, other people won't know. It takes nothing to click share,
[03:28:34.720 --> 03:28:38.960]  retweet, retruth, read this, read that. It takes nothing.
[03:28:38.960 --> 03:28:43.599]  Absolutely. Tom, we've got to go to break. We've got to go to break. Tom,
[03:28:43.599 --> 03:28:48.480]  thank you so, so much for joining us today. Thank you for your service to humanity.
[03:28:48.480 --> 03:28:52.720]  You're just a hero in my eyes. And I'm so grateful for you. We'll be back. Don't go
[03:28:52.720 --> 03:28:58.560]  anywhere. Thank you to Tom. You're going to want to pay attention
[03:28:58.560 --> 03:29:03.039]  to what I'm about to say in the next 60 seconds. Two new incredible products are now

[03:31:22.640 --> 03:31:29.119]  really found that makes a difference is brain force. I'll take brain force in the morning right
[03:31:29.119 --> 03:31:33.920]  before I go to my computer and I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot
[03:31:33.920 --> 03:31:39.359]  of stuff. So it really is true that brain force is something I use every day and it helps me

[03:32:56.240 --> 03:33:05.519]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:05.800 --> 03:33:22.039]  You know, Tom is absolutely right, and we got cut off by the break there, but every
[03:33:22.039 --> 03:33:28.119]  single person that shares the information and shares, you really underestimate the power
[03:33:28.119 --> 03:33:34.519]  of sharing a report, sharing an article, and even though we live in an age where information
[03:33:34.519 --> 03:33:41.920]  is coming thick and fast, most of the time people will pay attention to reputable organizations
[03:33:41.920 --> 03:33:47.880]  such as Infowars, zmedia.com here in Australia. We have a really, really solid reputation.
[03:33:47.880 --> 03:33:52.720]  I'm grateful for that, but people will pay attention and something might catch your
[03:33:52.720 --> 03:33:57.320]  attention. I mean, I know how many bits of information our audience send us through
[03:33:57.320 --> 03:34:02.560]  every single day and we're grateful for that and how quickly the information comes
[03:34:02.560 --> 03:34:08.460]  and changes, but don't think that you sharing something doesn't make an impact. Something
[03:34:08.460 --> 03:34:13.580]  might catch someone's eye and all of a sudden they're down the rabbit hole investigating
[03:34:13.580 --> 03:34:17.019]  and they've realized how serious this is in their lives. I spoke to a pharmacist
[03:34:17.019 --> 03:34:21.599]  recently who was muzzled and I told her about central bank digital currencies and
[03:34:21.599 --> 03:34:27.060]  she said, what do you mean? This is horrific. I want to learn more. Now, if she's
[03:34:27.060 --> 03:34:35.300]  muzzled, at this point she's likely also injected. I don't judge her, but you can see
[03:34:35.300 --> 03:34:43.539]  that once this affects someone personally, once it actually affects their financial
[03:34:43.539 --> 03:34:47.660]  freedom, they're all of a sudden interested in this. This is what I've been saying for
[03:34:47.660 --> 03:34:52.060]  some time. When we're talking about the CBDCs and now this unified ledger dystopian
[03:34:52.060 --> 03:34:55.060]  nightmare crap.
[03:34:53.300 --> 03:35:00.779]  When we're talking about this, this is what can actually unify humanity, what can actually
[03:35:00.779 --> 03:35:07.000]  bring people together for a common cause. And what Edward was saying with Alex before was
[03:35:07.000 --> 03:35:12.539]  that you think that they didn't preempt that people would want to unify and be looking
[03:35:12.539 --> 03:35:18.820]  for this political leader or that political leader to save the day? No. We have to become
[03:35:18.820 --> 03:35:23.880]  our own leaders. We have to be the leaders of our own lives. And the way to do that again
[03:35:23.880 --> 03:35:31.400]  is admit that evil exists, become educated on these things, and take active steps to
[03:35:31.400 --> 03:35:35.920]  unify those around you, educate those around you, and see what we can do to be proactive
[03:35:35.920 --> 03:35:42.259]  about it. And the best way to be proactive right now, apart from preparing for the worst,
[03:35:42.259 --> 03:35:46.000]  is to tell everyone, hey, do you know that they're about to strip your assets?
[03:35:46.000 --> 03:35:50.800]  Do you know that if you eat too much meat this month, your bank account will be shut off?
[03:35:51.000 --> 03:35:55.800]  So I want to send, I want to go through this.
[03:35:55.800 --> 03:36:02.840]  I've reported on, and hopefully the team have it right now, this particular report called
[03:36:02.840 --> 03:36:08.020]  The Future of Urban Consumption in a 1.5 Degree World.
[03:36:08.020 --> 03:36:11.680]  This is in conjunction with Arup and C40 Cities.
[03:36:11.680 --> 03:36:18.680]  Arup is a consulting firm and as I said, I've reported on this before and the full report
[03:36:18.680 --> 03:36:19.680]  is on zmedia.com.
[03:36:19.680 --> 03:36:26.840]  I've sent that link to the team as well, but it's so crucial for people to understand how
[03:36:26.840 --> 03:36:34.480]  far these maniacs want to take this when it comes to restricting everything you do, where
[03:36:34.480 --> 03:36:41.440]  you go, what you think, what you say, down to your physical assets.
[03:36:41.440 --> 03:36:47.240]  Who are you to take my assets, to take my anything?
[03:36:47.240 --> 03:36:53.080]  And the best way to stand up against this is to not back down.
[03:36:53.080 --> 03:36:57.400]  I've spoken about this before and I don't bring it up for any other reason than to
[03:36:57.400 --> 03:37:00.080]  tell you that they tried to shut me up.
[03:37:00.080 --> 03:37:07.740]  They ran a report on 60 Minutes here in Australia alluding to the fact that I was some sort
[03:37:07.740 --> 03:37:12.520]  of a domestic terrorist that was radicalizing the Australian people and then de-banked me
[03:37:12.520 --> 03:37:16.640]  within pretty much a week of each other.
[03:37:16.640 --> 03:37:18.200]  They want us to shut up.
[03:37:18.200 --> 03:37:20.280]  They want us to stop fighting.
[03:37:20.280 --> 03:37:23.760]  Look at what Alex has been through for goodness sake.
[03:37:23.760 --> 03:37:28.840]  Look at the ridiculous, not even allowed to say I'm innocent in court.
[03:37:28.840 --> 03:37:31.400]  They want you to shut up and be afraid.
[03:37:31.400 --> 03:37:35.440]  So this information that we're giving you today is not so that you are afraid.
[03:37:35.440 --> 03:37:38.240]  It is to say this is where they want to take this.
[03:37:38.240 --> 03:37:40.320]  Are you going to let them humanity?
[03:37:40.320 --> 03:37:44.600]  Are you going to let them take this here?
[03:37:44.600 --> 03:37:47.160]  It's up to us, really.
[03:37:47.160 --> 03:37:50.160]  It is up to us.
[03:37:50.160 --> 03:37:54.900]  So in this report that I've sent through to the team, if they've got it, bring it
[03:37:54.900 --> 03:37:57.120]  up for me, guys.
[03:37:57.120 --> 03:38:06.040]  The first page you can see the future of urban consumption in a 1.5 degree world.
[03:38:06.040 --> 03:38:07.040]  Fantastic.
[03:38:07.040 --> 03:38:08.040]  They have it.
[03:38:08.040 --> 03:38:18.520]  And if you go to page 38 of this PDF, it actually tells you some of what they want to achieve
[03:38:18.520 --> 03:38:19.520]  here.
[03:38:19.520 --> 03:38:22.360]  So they talk about material efficiencies.
[03:38:22.360 --> 03:38:27.680]  They talk about enhancing building use, material switching, low carbon cement, things like
[03:38:27.680 --> 03:38:31.520]  that when it comes to buildings and infrastructure.
[03:38:31.520 --> 03:38:36.320]  So you would have seen that the construction industry as it is is under attack.
[03:38:36.320 --> 03:38:40.480]  I don't know what it's like in the United States, but here in Australia, we've had multiple
[03:38:40.480 --> 03:38:46.640]  builders going under because of COVID and whatever.
[03:38:46.640 --> 03:38:49.960]  And because of the destruction of businesses.
[03:38:49.960 --> 03:38:55.600]  But this particular page, it's actually 74 of the report, page 74 of this report talks
[03:38:55.600 --> 03:38:59.100]  about how they want to impact the construction industry.
[03:38:59.100 --> 03:39:04.840]  So if you think that because they're going to build smart cities, there's always going
[03:39:04.840 --> 03:39:06.240]  to be jobs in construction.
[03:39:06.240 --> 03:39:09.880]  There are only going to be jobs if you comply with their nonsense.
[03:39:09.880 --> 03:39:19.720]  If you comply with only using this material or paying extra taxes, if you veer outside
[03:39:19.720 --> 03:39:20.960]  of that.
[03:39:20.960 --> 03:39:25.680]  What Tom was talking about before, they'll just tax you through the nose.
[03:39:25.680 --> 03:39:35.200]  I'm not a building expert, but you can see in here that they want to actually reduce
[03:39:35.200 --> 03:39:38.360]  the amount of construction that goes on around the world.
[03:39:38.360 --> 03:39:44.000]  Are you a small to medium sized building company that's going to be impacted by this?
[03:39:44.000 --> 03:39:49.680]  So this report, I was saying before, is in conjunction with C40 cities and Arup, if
[03:39:49.680 --> 03:39:55.240]  you actually look at who's backing these organizations, you've got the Clintons and
[03:39:55.240 --> 03:40:03.720]  the usual suspects from the Satanist crew backing these initiatives.
[03:40:03.720 --> 03:40:10.940]  And if you keep going down to the report, I think it's page 40 of the PDF, which is
[03:40:10.940 --> 03:40:18.420]  page 78 of this report, they talk about food consumption interventions.
[03:40:18.420 --> 03:40:24.320]  So this is what they want to implement in order to achieve their climate goals.
[03:40:24.320 --> 03:40:27.480]  And again, this affects everyone.
[03:40:27.480 --> 03:40:31.280]  So they're talking about dietary changes and what they do have here is progressive
[03:40:31.280 --> 03:40:33.480]  targets and ambitious targets.
[03:40:33.480 --> 03:40:37.840]  So progressive targets, they're saying we're definitely going to achieve this, but the
[03:40:37.840 --> 03:40:40.940]  ambitious target is what we really want to move to.
[03:40:40.940 --> 03:40:45.760]  So you look at this progressive target by 2030, 16 kilograms of meat per person
[03:40:45.760 --> 03:40:47.080]  per year.
[03:40:47.080 --> 03:40:54.360]  The ambitious target is zero kilograms of meat consumption per person per year.
[03:40:54.360 --> 03:41:00.660]  So this is giving the top down approach of the, now imagine this with the infrastructure
[03:41:00.660 --> 03:41:07.620]  of CBDCs and this unified ledger set up together, and you go and you eat meat.
[03:41:07.620 --> 03:41:09.860]  What's going to happen to your assets?
[03:41:09.860 --> 03:41:11.820]  I'm talking to everyone right now.
[03:41:11.820 --> 03:41:18.300]  I'm talking to every free person on earth, not just people that are in the middle class.
[03:41:18.300 --> 03:41:19.300]  This is everyone.
[03:41:19.400 --> 03:41:26.160]  Hey, particularly if you're wealthy and you like to go out for a nice steak, what happens
[03:41:26.160 --> 03:41:29.480]  if you go over the zero kilograms of meat consumption?
[03:41:29.480 --> 03:41:33.980]  And we already know Mayor Adams in New York said he's going to ban meat because it's going
[03:41:33.980 --> 03:41:37.600]  to be the new world order Satanists at the top and the mayors at the bottom controlling
[03:41:37.600 --> 03:41:41.680]  everything and then AI making it happen in between.
[03:41:41.680 --> 03:41:48.480]  So what happens to you and your freedom of choosing what you want to eat?
[03:41:48.600 --> 03:41:57.860]  If we go down to page 42 of the PDF, which is page 82 of this report, this covers clothing
[03:41:57.860 --> 03:41:59.920]  and textiles.
[03:41:59.920 --> 03:42:04.100]  Look at this, reduce the number of clothing and textile items.
[03:42:04.100 --> 03:42:10.780]  The progressive target for 2030 is eight new clothing items per person per year.
[03:42:10.780 --> 03:42:15.620]  The ambitious target for 2030, and by the way, the progressive and ambitious, they're
[03:42:15.620 --> 03:42:20.920]  actually incentivised, the council of mayors, they're incentivised to reach the ambitious
[03:42:20.920 --> 03:42:26.580]  targets, which means likely financial incentives.
[03:42:26.580 --> 03:42:29.300]  Three new clothing items per person per year.
[03:42:29.400 --> 03:42:57.400]  I saw a bit of propaganda put out by the World Economic Forum just the other day about how you've got to start sewing your clothes to save the climate, which I'm not against not being wasteful, but I am against someone telling me how many items of clothing I can buy per year. Does this cover socks? Am I only allowed three socks? Humanity, we can't let this happen. More on the other side of the break. Don't go anywhere.
[03:42:57.400 --> 03:43:12.400]  We finally have our original best-selling colloidal silver back in stock. With the supply chain breakdowns and all the problems of the economy, we could not get the highest quality colloidal silver for almost three years back in stock.
[03:43:12.400 --> 03:43:34.400]  But now we've got it. Thirty parts per million from the top lab. We've got a limited shipment. Hopefully we'll have a lot of it in the future, but if you want to experience and have in your medicine cabinet, have in your preparedness arsenal high quality colloidal silver from the best manufacturer, we have it right now private labeled under the name Silver Bullet at Infowarsstore.com.

[03:43:52.400 --> 03:44:06.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset in the War for the World, is a historic book that documents the globalists in their own words, planned for our future that is a hellish future.
[03:44:06.400 --> 03:44:15.400]  Now you'll be always, while they still allow books I guess, they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset in the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or Infowarsstore.com.
[03:44:16.400 --> 03:44:23.400]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out, and there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[03:44:23.400 --> 03:44:29.400]  So get your copy of The Great Reset in the War for the World, a signed copy at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:44:29.400 --> 03:44:33.400]  And there is a mark up there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[03:44:33.400 --> 03:44:39.400]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that you help keep Infowars on the air.
[03:44:39.400 --> 03:44:43.400]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book, or unsigned copies.
[03:44:43.400 --> 03:44:53.400]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowarsstore.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library or give them to the local school.
[03:44:53.400 --> 03:44:56.400]  This is an Infowar, I'm counting on you, and thank you for your support.
[03:44:56.400 --> 03:45:03.400]  When I tell you we have the ultimate bone broth, hands down this is the most concentrated, high quality bone broth there is.
[03:45:03.400 --> 03:45:16.400]  Concentrated chicken broth, patented amazing, then a huge dose of chaga mushroom, a massive dose of beet pollen, a gigantic dose of highest quality turmeric, and then it just gets crazier from there.

[03:46:47.400 --> 03:46:53.400]  The answer to 1984 is 1776 and the answer for energy is Brainforce.
[03:46:55.800 --> 03:47:04.519]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:06.000 --> 03:47:17.480]  All right, we're going to breeze through the rest of this stupid report. And I call
[03:47:17.480 --> 03:47:24.440]  it stupid not because it's a bad report to read, because everyone should read it. And
[03:47:24.440 --> 03:47:30.000]  I've been talking about it for some time. But it's stupid because this is how little
[03:47:30.000 --> 03:47:35.240]  the globalists think of you, everyone, every one of us. Unless we are in the club, they
[03:47:35.240 --> 03:47:41.840]  think of us as nothing. And I, for one, know that I'm not nothing. I know what value God
[03:47:41.840 --> 03:47:50.560]  places on the human being. I'm something in God's eyes. And so no man, particularly not
[03:47:50.560 --> 03:47:55.240]  one that serves Satan, is going to tell me that I'm of less value than them. They
[03:47:55.240 --> 03:47:55.960]  can shove it.
[03:47:56.000 --> 03:48:04.000]  But on page 86 of this report it talks about private vehicle ownership. So, the progressive
[03:48:04.000 --> 03:48:14.360]  target for 2030, which is what they'll likely achieve, is 190 vehicles per 1000 people,
[03:48:14.360 --> 03:48:19.760]  and the ambitious target is zero private vehicles. This is what Rideshare has been
[03:48:19.760 --> 03:48:28.720]  all about. It's about conditioning us for this. And they want public transport and people to be
[03:48:28.720 --> 03:48:33.360]  used to that. They're banning cars in the cities now, low emissions zones, all of these sorts of
[03:48:33.360 --> 03:48:37.600]  things, making it unaffordable for you to own your private vehicle, for you to drive your
[03:48:37.600 --> 03:48:44.320]  private vehicle, taxing you through your nose. And I was reading recently that medium businesses,
[03:48:45.280 --> 03:48:52.560]  the ones that actually survived COVID and the destruction on the economic system that was
[03:48:52.560 --> 03:49:00.720]  orchestrated, that they'll be taxed more now to recover the costs of COVID. So, we made it almost
[03:49:00.720 --> 03:49:06.160]  impossible for you to continue your business with these insane restrictions that did nothing
[03:49:06.160 --> 03:49:11.600]  but destroy the economy, which was the plan all along. And now we're going to tax you for it,
[03:49:11.600 --> 03:49:19.520]  because how dare you survive the way that we tried to destroy you? How dare you?
[03:49:19.800 --> 03:49:27.119]  On page 90 of this report, it talks about reducing the number of flights. So the progressive
[03:49:27.119 --> 03:49:33.640]  target is one short haul return flight of less than 1500 kilometers every two years
[03:49:33.640 --> 03:49:41.560]  per person. Their ambitious target is one short haul return flight less than 1500 kilometers
[03:49:41.560 --> 03:49:48.359]  every three years per person. The team brought up that Guardian article just before.
[03:49:48.400 --> 03:49:52.480]  I'll get them to bring it up again if they can, but first there is, well actually they've got it up now.
[03:49:52.480 --> 03:50:00.920]  Airlines could ditch flights to Australia to meet future emissions promises. Parliament has been told.
[03:50:00.920 --> 03:50:08.480]  I was alerted to this because Channel 10, one of the main legacy media channels here in Australia,
[03:50:08.480 --> 03:50:14.080]  and if the team have got that picture, have a look at this. Flights to and from Australia
[03:50:14.720 --> 03:50:21.840]  could be axed for climate. That's the headline. International flights to and from Australia might
[03:50:21.840 --> 03:50:28.080]  be cancelled in the coming years to meet carbon emissions targets. So that's the 10 news first
[03:50:28.880 --> 03:50:32.560]  headline that I saw and then I went looking and I found this Guardian article,
[03:50:33.359 --> 03:50:40.320]  which talks about operators are warning that long haul routes to nation risk being priced out of
[03:50:40.320 --> 03:50:45.920]  international aviation when carbon pricing takes effect over the next decade. So this is what I'm
[03:50:45.920 --> 03:50:54.960]  saying people. This affects everyone. This isn't just the middle class. It's not just the poor
[03:50:54.960 --> 03:51:00.640]  that are affected by what the globalists want to do. If you are not in their satanic pedophile
[03:51:00.640 --> 03:51:08.800]  club, you're in the same camp as everyone else. Your money won't save you, especially
[03:51:08.800 --> 03:51:14.400]  when your assets are digitized on the unified ledger, especially when a central bank digital
[03:51:14.400 --> 03:51:19.279]  currency is implemented and you don't have control over what you can do with your money
[03:51:19.279 --> 03:51:25.279]  because the Clintons and the others that are contributing to these great ideas about how
[03:51:25.279 --> 03:51:30.560]  we're going to manage climate change are going to tell you what you can and can't do with
[03:51:30.560 --> 03:51:36.080]  your millions of dollars. So what's the point of having them if you have no control over it?
[03:51:36.080 --> 03:51:41.759]  Do you know that financial freedom is one of the most powerful things? And if you're wealthy
[03:51:41.759 --> 03:51:47.920]  in particular, you'll understand this. Financial freedom is one of the most powerful ways to stand
[03:51:47.920 --> 03:51:53.279]  up against tyranny. So what do you have left when they remove your financial freedom?
[03:51:53.500 --> 03:52:00.860]  What do you have left when you can no longer choose where you spend your money? Or worse
[03:52:00.860 --> 03:52:06.740]  still, as they said, the central bank digital currency, we can program it to expire by a
[03:52:06.740 --> 03:52:14.900]  certain date. So what? You've got 50 million in the bank and you're not in the club and
[03:52:14.900 --> 03:52:22.780]  all of a sudden your CBDC expires within two months? Good luck to you. So then you're
[03:52:22.780 --> 03:52:27.540]  left with a choice. What, do you have to join the club or become like the rest of the serfs?
[03:52:28.000 --> 03:52:54.880]  Do you understand what I'm saying? This is not just the middle class, this is all of humanity. And by the way, they want to obliterate the middle class. I reported recently on the fact that they're talking about AI is going to take all these jobs and they predicted in Australia which suburbs were going to become a Rust Belt suburb.
[03:52:54.900 --> 03:53:04.119]  Like what happened in the United States some decades ago. And they're saying that because
[03:53:04.119 --> 03:53:09.640]  all of these middle class suburbs that have white collar workers are going to be replaced,
[03:53:09.640 --> 03:53:15.520]  you know, Google's talking about replacing journalists with their AI, they're offering
[03:53:15.520 --> 03:53:19.199]  it to I think the Washington Post if I'm not mistaken and a couple of others or the Wall
[03:53:19.199 --> 03:53:24.840]  Street Journal actually. So they're replacing these journalists, all these journalists that
[03:53:24.840 --> 03:53:31.119]  sold their souls in the middle of COVID would not report the truth and continued.
[03:53:31.119 --> 03:53:35.199]  You know, some people will say, well, they weren't allowed to report the truth. Yeah,
[03:53:35.199 --> 03:53:39.680]  okay, so what do you do? You're not allowed to report the truth so you keep reporting
[03:53:39.680 --> 03:53:45.960]  lies? Is that the answer? Okay, you're about to be replaced by AI now. So you went
[03:53:45.960 --> 03:53:51.220]  and got your shot and complied with daddy government just for the sake of continuing
[03:53:51.220 --> 03:53:57.100]  to have a job. And now you're going to be replaced by a robot anyway. You fool.
[03:53:57.600 --> 03:54:04.400]  You are not excluded from all of the people that are going to be affected by this. None
[03:54:04.400 --> 03:54:10.240]  of us are. So if humanity doesn't realise, if they don't come together right now, in
[03:54:10.240 --> 03:54:19.320]  this final stand, it is game over. Everything that Alex has been warning about for 30 years
[03:54:19.320 --> 03:54:23.120]  is coming to a head right now. It's in front of us. It's in front of our eyes.
[03:54:23.200 --> 03:54:32.360]  And at any moment, they could pluck out one of a million different options that they have.
[03:54:32.360 --> 03:54:37.040]  Cyber attack, fake alien invasion, God knows what.
[03:54:37.040 --> 03:54:40.160]  How many people will be terrified?
[03:54:40.200 --> 03:54:46.560]  How many people will be too scared into compliance?
[03:54:46.560 --> 03:54:48.320]  How deep is your love of money?
[03:54:48.400 --> 03:54:59.400]  It will cause you to comply with this unified ledger, with the requirements of you maintaining your assets.
[03:54:59.400 --> 03:55:03.400]  Shut up or lose it all.
[03:55:03.400 --> 03:55:11.400]  Because I'll tell you what, many people complied with the shots because they were scared of losing their jobs.
[03:55:10.900 --> 03:55:16.900]  Many people did not trust God in that time.
[03:55:16.900 --> 03:55:19.900]  People get offended with me when I say you weren't forced.
[03:55:19.900 --> 03:55:22.900]  No, you weren't. You weren't.
[03:55:22.900 --> 03:55:25.900]  You were coerced. You were manipulated.
[03:55:25.900 --> 03:55:26.900]  You were pressured.
[03:55:26.900 --> 03:55:33.900]  But not one person, at least in the Western world, was pinned down and forcefully injected.
[03:55:33.900 --> 03:55:34.900]  Next time they will be.
[03:55:34.900 --> 03:55:44.900]  Every single person was able to say no and find something else or trust God.
[03:55:44.900 --> 03:55:51.900]  Man, he made manna come down from heaven and fed people in the desert.
[03:55:51.900 --> 03:55:56.900]  You think he can't do it again? So what happens when the unified ledger is there?
[03:55:56.900 --> 03:56:03.900]  What happens when the central bank digital currency is there and the wrong words or the wrong thought cause your bank account to be shut off?
[03:56:03.900 --> 03:56:13.900]  I know what it feels like. Will you compromise? Or do we sit here and wait until the infrastructure is there and they're already doing it?
[03:56:13.900 --> 03:56:18.900]  And do we just watch and go, oh no, they're doing it. What are we going to do? No.
[03:56:18.900 --> 03:56:27.900]  Humanity, this is the time to fight. Every single person on earth must know this information.
[03:56:27.900 --> 03:56:33.900]  So again, I go back to what I was saying about not underestimating the power of sharing this information,
[03:56:33.900 --> 03:56:42.900]  not underestimating the power of educating people every single time you speak to someone and inform them of this information.
[03:56:42.900 --> 03:56:45.900]  It can change the world.
[03:56:45.900 --> 03:56:56.940]  The trajectory that we're heading on is human enslavement forever, but more and more people
[03:56:56.940 --> 03:57:02.820]  are starting to realize it and that's dangerous to the globalists. Why? Because the truth
[03:57:02.820 --> 03:57:10.119]  is powerful. The truth is what they fear more than anything. They fear you saying,
[03:57:10.119 --> 03:57:15.340]  I don't care how you gaslight me. I don't care what you do to me. I am not going to
[03:57:15.340 --> 03:57:19.500]  back down and neither are these people next to me. And you know what? Even if they do, I won't.
[03:57:19.900 --> 03:57:31.100]  They hate strength. They hate courage. And for that reason, we must resolve within ourselves
[03:57:31.100 --> 03:57:38.020]  to never ever back down. It's been an honor being with you here today. I'm Maria Zee from

[03:58:42.560 --> 03:58:53.560]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into
[03:58:53.560 --> 03:58:59.000]  the atmosphere. The surrounding communities began to get sick. Laws were enacted to
[03:58:59.000 --> 03:59:05.400]  compel these corporations to install scrubbers, to convert these gases into floresolic acid,
[03:59:05.400 --> 03:59:11.720]  still highly toxic but containable. Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison and there
[03:59:11.760 --> 03:59:16.680]  was no affordable way to dispose of it. Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was
[03:59:16.680 --> 03:59:21.560]  also the Secretary of the Treasury who was responsible for the Public Health Service at
[03:59:21.560 --> 03:59:28.040]  the time. And by 1950, the US government began buying this toxic untreated industrial
[03:59:28.040 --> 03:59:33.080]  waste product and dumping it into our drinking water. Reputable studies show that it's
[03:59:33.080 --> 03:59:39.280]  causing various cancers and other disease. With the Alexa Peer Pro, you can have clean
[03:59:39.320 --> 03:59:45.640]  drinking water and a remedy to this madness. Available now at InfowarsStore.com.
