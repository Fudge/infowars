[00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:23.661]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[00:00:23.661 --> 00:00:27.602]  Well, Friday was a bad day.
[00:00:27.602 --> 00:00:32.965]  The rogue government, deep state, Clinton, stay behind network.
[00:00:34.184 --> 00:01:00.735]  organized crime controller their final last ditch fortress inside the federal government to hold their whole house of criminal cards together Robert fixer for the Clintons and for the Bush's and for Obama Mueller had two judges and we saw big coverage of the top judge in the Manafort case the top judge in Russiagate in Fantasyland
[00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:13.508]  Coming out and saying that Mueller had lied to them to get the warrants and that it was all fake and that he was just trying to get Trump impeached.
[00:01:13.508 --> 00:01:14.669]  Those are quotes.
[00:01:14.669 --> 00:01:18.292]  And that he had unfettered power or was attempting unfettered power.
[00:01:18.292 --> 00:01:20.013]  That means rogue or runaway.
[00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:21.795]  Let's get the definition of unfettered.
[00:01:21.795 --> 00:01:24.757]  It means unblocked, unbridled, rogue.
[00:01:26.445 --> 00:01:30.687]  Get me the English Oxford if we can, because I like it, because it'll have six or seven definitions below it.
[00:01:30.687 --> 00:01:32.248]  Let's see if my memory serves right.
[00:01:32.248 --> 00:01:34.328]  I haven't actually looked it up, but I know what it means.
[00:01:34.328 --> 00:01:36.730]  Unfettered, released from restraint or inhibition.
[00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.291]  That means rogue or runaway.
[00:01:39.291 --> 00:01:43.873]  And then let's scroll down, let's see some more of the definition.
[00:01:43.873 --> 00:01:51.156]  Unbridled, rampant, uninhibited, unconstrained, unrestricted, unchecked, unmuffled, uncontrolled.
[00:01:53.203 --> 00:01:59.366]  Top federal judge in Russiagate calls it unrestrained, rogue, out of control.
[00:01:59.366 --> 00:02:11.113]  And then the other top federal judge on the circuit court, on another circuit court, handling the case of the lawsuit where they're suing all these Russian companies going, we have proof.
[00:02:12.332 --> 00:02:15.893]  That you messed with the election while the Russian company showed up for court.
[00:02:15.893 --> 00:02:17.014]  Said, let's start discovery.
[00:02:17.014 --> 00:02:24.657]  And Mueller went, uh, actually judge, we might want to stop for six months or we might drop this entirely because it's totally made up.
[00:02:24.657 --> 00:02:25.337]  But that's what they do.
[00:02:25.337 --> 00:02:32.660]  They file lawsuits or they file these indictments and then try to hold it up to just hang it out there in the news.
[00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.402]  And go, Roger Stone was in contact with the Guccifer 2.0.
[00:02:39.341 --> 00:02:42.403]  All of the media was going to the message board that he frequented.
[00:02:42.403 --> 00:02:45.445]  You can go there at 100, CBS, NBC, ABC.
[00:02:45.445 --> 00:02:49.087]  Everyone's like, Guccifer, Guccifer, if you've got such big leaks, talk to us.
[00:02:49.087 --> 00:02:54.470]  And Roger, one time, is on there saying, I hope you'll talk to me sometime.
[00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.113]  After the time, they claim all the hacking went on.
[00:02:58.113 --> 00:02:59.974]  Of course people are reaching out to Guccifer 2.0.
[00:02:59.974 --> 00:03:04.216]  I remember walking into my producers going, get me Guccifer 2.0.
[00:03:07.142 --> 00:03:09.543]  It's like I'm saying, get me Julian Assange.
[00:03:09.543 --> 00:03:13.864]  But see, I'm not establishment enough to have Julian Assange on or Guccifer.
[00:03:13.864 --> 00:03:16.625]  They all want to go on the New York Times, their enemy site.
[00:03:16.625 --> 00:03:18.665]  And the New York Times had those people on.
[00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:22.066]  They had them on, but that's okay.
[00:03:22.066 --> 00:03:28.428]  But that's what they do on CNN, breathlessly, with David Corn this weekend on MSNBC.
[00:03:28.428 --> 00:03:29.068]  Did you see?
[00:03:29.068 --> 00:03:31.349]  Oh my God, Roger Stone, he's the main guy they're after.
[00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.029]  Oh my gosh, this means they've got massive proof.
[00:03:34.029 --> 00:03:35.590]  Boy, he's in a lot of trouble.
[00:03:37.335 --> 00:03:39.156]  And it's all made up.
[00:03:39.156 --> 00:03:49.964]  And now the federal judge in two of these cases talks about how hundreds of pages of these indictments and these lawsuits, one's civil, one's criminal, are blacked out.
[00:03:51.223 --> 00:04:03.191]  Well, the judge wants to see what's unblacked out, because already on these cases, other stuff has been unblacked out, and it's all about their agents saying, there's no evidence, there's nothing, we've come up dry.
[00:04:03.191 --> 00:04:10.837]  Just like Strzok, talking to his girlfriends, like, man, I want out of this, there's nothing there, and we're gonna get in a lot of trouble.
[00:04:10.837 --> 00:04:14.940]  Well, we're meeting with Andy, he said it'll be alright, Andy McCabe, the deputy director.
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.234]  So you got the Capo above him for the Don, you know, the Clintons above him, the Don, the Clinton crime machines got the...
[00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.451]  You've got the major mob chiefs under him, and then you've got the capos beneath that.
[00:04:27.451 --> 00:04:32.913]  You've got Andrew McCabe, and then you've got the little street soldiers going, Boss, are you sure?
[00:04:32.913 --> 00:04:34.653]  Are you sure it's going to be all right?
[00:04:34.653 --> 00:04:40.275]  I mean, we paid for the illegal dossier it's made up, and now there's nothing there except you, boss!
[00:04:40.275 --> 00:04:40.695]  You!
[00:04:40.695 --> 00:04:40.935]  You!
[00:04:40.935 --> 00:04:42.956]  We get the Russian money all the time!
[00:04:42.956 --> 00:04:44.256]  It's okay, right?
[00:04:44.256 --> 00:04:47.037]  We try to bust the president now that he's the president!
[00:04:47.037 --> 00:04:50.298]  It's actually, you know, they sent the text message, they might get us!
[00:04:50.658 --> 00:04:52.979]  Are you sure we'll get away with it?
[00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:54.800]  I mean, we're scared.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.821]  We'll poop our little pantsies.
[00:04:56.821 --> 00:04:59.843]  We'll be back.

[00:06:10.788 --> 00:06:13.409]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:29.733]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:29.733 --> 00:06:32.733]  Man, do we have a broadcast for you.
[00:06:32.733 --> 00:06:38.215]  Unbelievable video, unbelievable reports, unbelievable developments, the good, the bad, the ugly.
[00:06:38.215 --> 00:06:39.375]  It is all just crazy.
[00:06:41.001 --> 00:06:44.963]  We had Owen Schroer and Michael Zimmerman up there Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.
[00:06:44.963 --> 00:06:47.925]  And I'm told he's going to be popping in at the bottom of the hour.
[00:06:47.925 --> 00:06:50.046]  Has Owen Schroer entered the building yet?
[00:06:50.046 --> 00:06:51.027]  I haven't seen him.
[00:06:51.027 --> 00:06:53.388]  I'm told Owen Schroer will be here.
[00:06:53.388 --> 00:06:55.429]  They went down to the NRA inside and out.
[00:06:55.429 --> 00:06:57.130]  It was amazing.
[00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:02.693]  Shot Trump's speech live, met a lot of patriots, and then went outside of the anti-gunners.
[00:07:02.693 --> 00:07:09.998]  And at the local city park, they wouldn't even allow press in that wasn't anti-gun to politely interview the anti-gunners.
[00:07:11.272 --> 00:07:36.297]  Then other people, politely, just simply walk up to the tiny group of anti-gunners, where some B actress from the 80s was there, and they've got armed security guarding Melissa Milano, again, an unknown B actress, basically, from thousands of years ago, and these guys come up and say, yeah, we're armed, get out of here, want you to leave, and then basically push them out of the park.
[00:07:36.297 --> 00:07:40.398]  The image of armed bodyguards guarding the B actress, because she's a god,
[00:07:41.423 --> 00:07:46.948]  You, though, you don't get a right to protect yourself, according to these people.
[00:07:46.948 --> 00:07:51.032]  And they say, oh, you're with Infowars, you've been told to leave.
[00:07:51.032 --> 00:07:53.374]  And the guy goes, I'm not with Infowars.
[00:07:53.374 --> 00:08:01.902]  But it's literally just these entitled, arrogant, in my view, crazy liberals that just show up.
[00:08:01.902 --> 00:08:05.004]  And by the way, I'm not just saying I'd have stood my ground.
[00:08:05.004 --> 00:08:06.386]  Pull up footage of
[00:08:08.905 --> 00:08:11.787]  Dallas Sheriff's Department attacks Alex Jones.
[00:08:11.787 --> 00:08:12.428]  I was up there.
[00:08:12.428 --> 00:08:17.632]  The Dallas Police Department said, yes, you can march without a permit.
[00:08:17.632 --> 00:08:21.255]  They're in the JFK 40th anniversary.
[00:08:21.255 --> 00:08:27.019]  And then at the end of it, the whole service is over where the police chief says, you can go in the park now.
[00:08:27.019 --> 00:08:31.823]  Personally tells me that we go over there and the Sheriff's Department says, no, you can't.
[00:08:31.823 --> 00:08:38.608]  So we sit there and nicely demonstrate about 20 minutes and a couple hundred goons show up from the Democrat Party run Sheriff's Department.
[00:08:39.824 --> 00:08:43.168]  They've got a literal La Raza lady that runs it.
[00:08:43.168 --> 00:08:46.091]  And they've been federalized, it turned out, under Obama, and they attack us.
[00:08:46.091 --> 00:08:47.152]  And I stood up to them.
[00:08:47.152 --> 00:08:48.553]  I mean, you know, it was a couple hundred cops.
[00:08:48.553 --> 00:08:52.357]  They did ram us and hit us and attack children and finally push us out with their billy clubs.
[00:08:52.357 --> 00:08:54.379]  But I, you know, I stood my ground.
[00:08:55.410 --> 00:09:01.093]  So I'm just telling you, a couple thugs tell me to get out of a city park, and tell me they got guns?
[00:09:01.093 --> 00:09:04.415]  You put your hand on me, you're going to have a big problem.
[00:09:04.415 --> 00:09:19.042]  So, and I'm not knocking this guy, he probably was smarter than I'd be, backing down and just showing what thugs they were, but you watch this footage of some of these union people, and I'm guessing they're Democrat Party union enforcers, that's what they look like and what they act like.
[00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:25.032]  It is just crazy to see the total entitlement.
[00:09:25.032 --> 00:09:26.733]  You don't get guns.
[00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:29.194]  You don't get to have any of this.
[00:09:29.194 --> 00:09:34.437]  We have them, and we're going to then tell you you don't have a First Amendment.
[00:09:34.437 --> 00:09:37.059]  So that's coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:09:37.059 --> 00:09:43.142]  Now, there are so many incredible articles I've got here.
[00:09:43.142 --> 00:09:45.523]  But before I hit the really big ones, let me just hit this first.
[00:09:45.523 --> 00:09:49.666]  You can search engine, liberals are more likely to steal.
[00:09:51.161 --> 00:09:53.404]  And less likely to give to charity.
[00:09:53.404 --> 00:09:54.666]  You'll get Harvard studies.
[00:09:54.666 --> 00:09:56.569]  You'll get Toronto University studies.
[00:09:56.569 --> 00:10:00.474]  You'll get universities in England studies.
[00:10:00.474 --> 00:10:02.017]  Big studies.
[00:10:02.017 --> 00:10:06.944]  Well there's one in the Associated Press of all places.
[00:10:10.387 --> 00:10:17.392]  That just came out today, shock study, climate skeptics more eco-friendly than climate alarmists.
[00:10:17.392 --> 00:10:27.898]  Of course, conservatives and libertarians are better stewards of the land and actually recycle and do all the stuff, because we tend to be more OCD.
[00:10:27.898 --> 00:10:34.163]  The left, in major studies, they just pulled one up from a few years ago for TV viewers, are more likely to steal.
[00:10:34.163 --> 00:10:34.463]  What is it?
[00:10:35.555 --> 00:10:37.936]  Six times more likely to steal.
[00:10:37.936 --> 00:10:40.777]  Nine times more likely to not give to charity.
[00:10:40.777 --> 00:10:44.298]  But they're way more likely to tell you they're giving to charity.
[00:10:44.298 --> 00:10:46.378]  So there's one.
[00:10:46.378 --> 00:10:50.219]  Americans who are skeptical about climate change... Well, it used to be global freezing and warming.
[00:10:50.219 --> 00:10:50.960]  It's man-made.
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:51.880]  We're skeptical.
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.420]  We know that the climate's always changing.
[00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:55.921]  See how they play those games?
[00:10:55.921 --> 00:11:01.383]  Americans who are skeptical about climate change engage in personal behavior that's more friendly to the environment than climate alarmists.
[00:11:02.469 --> 00:11:05.630]  We support increased government regulation and new studies found.
[00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:13.131]  Yeah, University of Michigan led by a team of researchers and a year-long individual study of 600 Americans who regularly reported their climate change beliefs.
[00:11:13.131 --> 00:11:24.814]  And of course I want solar on my farmhouse because it makes sense and it costs less money in the long run and it's smart and it is good for the environment.
[00:11:24.814 --> 00:11:29.775]  Do I want giant windmills that have a bigger carbon footprint and kill all the birds and bankrupt every country they put them in?
[00:11:29.775 --> 00:11:29.835]  No.
[00:11:32.253 --> 00:11:35.134]  Is carbon dioxide the problem, or is it GMO?
[00:11:35.134 --> 00:11:36.694]  Is it cross-human species?
[00:11:36.694 --> 00:11:41.555]  Is it all of the geoengineering?
[00:11:41.555 --> 00:11:47.077]  See, there's real crises going on, and we get diverted with all the fake ones, but that's a big deal.
[00:11:47.077 --> 00:11:51.398]  Now, let me just tell you what's coming up in the next segment.
[00:11:53.556 --> 00:11:55.337]  Friday was not a good day.
[00:11:55.337 --> 00:12:00.681]  Most of the coverage was on the main federal judge over the Manafort case, who's the head Russiagate judge.
[00:12:00.681 --> 00:12:04.805]  One already recused themselves in the Flynn case.
[00:12:04.805 --> 00:12:07.647]  They now admit there's no evidence of criminality from Flynn.
[00:12:07.647 --> 00:12:09.408]  Why'd he plead guilty?
[00:12:09.408 --> 00:12:14.652]  Because it would cost him a million dollars, and he was on a general's payroll.
[00:12:14.652 --> 00:12:16.153]  That's a couple hundred thousand a year.
[00:12:16.153 --> 00:12:19.876]  Doesn't have the money.
[00:12:19.876 --> 00:12:20.937]  Stone's already spent a million.
[00:12:22.313 --> 00:12:25.674]  I have, I had to spend a lot of money with all the attacks they've got on me, all the fake stuff.
[00:12:25.674 --> 00:12:29.036]  That's what they do.
[00:12:29.036 --> 00:12:34.298]  But now they're looking at dropping the charges on Flynn, not because he said anything, not because he told Mueller what he wanted.
[00:12:34.298 --> 00:12:36.238]  There's nothing there.
[00:12:36.238 --> 00:12:45.242]  The president was president-elect and directed his national security advisor, in waiting, that's what you do the day you're elected, to contact the Russian ambassador.
[00:12:45.242 --> 00:12:47.663]  That's what you do.
[00:12:47.663 --> 00:12:48.643]  He never lied about it.
[00:12:51.018 --> 00:12:59.766]  But now, federal judge rejects Mueller's request for delay in Russian troll farm case, saying it's a fraud.
[00:12:59.766 --> 00:13:04.430]  And the other big federal judge accused Mueller team of lying to target and impeach Trump.
[00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:11.135]  That's a quote for quote, unfettered power.
[00:13:11.135 --> 00:13:12.236]  So that is coming up.
[00:13:12.236 --> 00:13:13.958]  I mean, this is devastating.
[00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.280]  These are the judges, three judges.
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.321]  One has recused themselves.
[00:13:18.484 --> 00:13:19.925]  On the Flynn case.
[00:13:19.925 --> 00:13:27.793]  Now the judge on this new Democrat lawsuit against the Russians and Trump and Stone says this is complete BS.
[00:13:27.793 --> 00:13:38.362]  And so Mueller's talking about dropping it or simply asking for a stay, a long stay till after the election.
[00:13:38.362 --> 00:13:39.804]  You talk about pulling your horns in.
[00:13:39.804 --> 00:13:41.025]  You talk about wanting it to go away.
[00:13:42.481 --> 00:13:53.186]  I mean, they indict 12 or 13 John Does, and then just say, because Mueller filed a lawsuit, the Democrats filed a lawsuit, that it's proof.
[00:13:53.186 --> 00:13:54.447]  And you know why Mueller's in trouble?
[00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:00.161]  He lied and said they weren't targeting Trump's lawyer.
[00:14:00.161 --> 00:14:07.604]  And all over the news, him and Comey testified to Congress that nobody ever targeted anybody in the Trump circle during the campaign, when he was president-elect or president.
[00:14:07.604 --> 00:14:13.266]  And now we all know they've admitted last week they were spying on Trump for two years before the election.
[00:14:13.266 --> 00:14:16.207]  And they were spying on his lawyer, and Trump cowered everything we told you.
[00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:21.050]  And they lied to get the warrants on Trump Tower about something completely different.
[00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:27.111]  The judge hasn't said what it is, but he blew up, it says, in the hearing and screamed at Mueller.
[00:14:27.111 --> 00:14:29.772]  And said, you lied to get these warrants!
[00:14:29.772 --> 00:14:31.272]  You're a liar!
[00:14:31.272 --> 00:14:35.813]  You want to impeach Trump!
[00:14:35.813 --> 00:14:39.014]  And then said, I've seen the unredacted pages.
[00:14:40.114 --> 00:14:43.055]  You're not releasing this for national security.
[00:14:43.055 --> 00:14:45.615]  You're doing it because it shows there's no case.
[00:14:45.615 --> 00:14:47.695]  Your own agents told you that.
[00:14:47.695 --> 00:14:48.956]  This is in the news.
[00:14:48.956 --> 00:14:52.416]  And what did Strzok say once the president was elected in office?
[00:14:52.416 --> 00:14:58.217]  He said to his girlfriend, there were the underlings running the whole fake Russiagate, he said, we've got to stop this.
[00:14:58.217 --> 00:14:59.337]  We can't do this.
[00:14:59.337 --> 00:15:01.998]  We're going to get in trouble.
[00:15:01.998 --> 00:15:04.698]  There's nothing there.
[00:15:04.698 --> 00:15:08.739]  But CEO, arrogant Brennan, an arrogant clapper,
[00:15:11.727 --> 00:15:23.251]  And all McCabe and all the other people above him, Comey and Mueller, they're all arrogant and in power for decades.
[00:15:23.251 --> 00:15:24.812]  Done whatever they want.
[00:15:24.812 --> 00:15:35.556]  Illegally spied, covered up murders, covered up real Russiagate, covered up Uranium One, covered up nuclear reactors, covered up Iran deals, payoffs, covered up all of it.
[00:15:35.556 --> 00:15:39.978]  And now, wow, they're not able to go with whatever they want and they're just freaking out.
[00:15:40.993 --> 00:15:46.776]  And crapping their britches in front of everyone, and the stink can be smelled all the way here in Texas from the swamp.
[00:15:46.776 --> 00:15:47.457]  Woo!
[00:15:47.457 --> 00:15:56.102]  And all you neocons and limp-wristed conservatives that signed on to all this, like Glenn Beck, aren't you fools now, you cowardly un-American scumbags!
[00:15:58.467 --> 00:16:02.748]  I was just about to walk out of the studio to pick my children up, and I got some bad news.
[00:16:02.748 --> 00:16:10.770]  For the second time in the five and a half year history of Survival Shield X2, our flagship product, we are having supply chain problems.
[00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:12.710]  And this may be the last batch of this.
[00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:19.311]  We have deep earth crystal source that's so pure that it actually turns into purple gas in the atmosphere.
[00:16:19.311 --> 00:16:21.832]  And so in our own search to get the purest form,
[00:16:22.572 --> 00:16:31.177]  We discovered that oil companies and gas drilling companies had a byproduct that they were selling to pharmaceutical companies and also drug makers that they used to make drugs.
[00:16:31.177 --> 00:16:35.740]  And once they figure out there's a market, they start jacking up the price.
[00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:39.602]  But we're offering it still 25% off until it sells out.
[00:16:39.602 --> 00:16:43.785]  Hopefully, just like the last time this happened a few years ago, it's not an issue and we do get more.
[00:16:43.785 --> 00:16:49.729]  But right now, we are not able to secure the crystals that produce the purest iodine in the world.
[00:16:49.729 --> 00:16:51.650]  But what it does is for stamina, libido,
[00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:54.351]  Focus energy is really amazing.

[00:20:17.353 --> 00:20:32.469]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[00:20:32.469 --> 00:20:35.112]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:44.017]  You know, when the mainstream corporate lying media tells you somebody's really, really good, you know they're really, really bad.
[00:20:44.017 --> 00:20:46.299]  And I've been on air 23 years.
[00:20:46.299 --> 00:20:49.902]  I remember Robert Mueller before he was the director of the FBI.
[00:20:52.199 --> 00:20:53.460]  ...was a true monster.
[00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:56.362]  Remember the whole Richard Jewell case?
[00:20:56.362 --> 00:21:05.529]  Three different people, who they tried to charge for the Olympic Park bombing, who they knew were totally innocent, and Mueller was there, honchoing, charging three innocent people.
[00:21:05.529 --> 00:21:14.156]  Now, he finally got a fourth guy, took him to a government mental institution, they filled him full of pills, and he died in the first few hours in custody.
[00:21:14.156 --> 00:21:16.498]  So they got their fourth guy on the Olympic Park bombing.
[00:21:19.633 --> 00:21:25.296]  But then they moved on from there and blamed some other Christian, quote, extremist, as they said.
[00:21:25.296 --> 00:21:30.438]  So five different people, Mueller said, did that.
[00:21:30.438 --> 00:21:31.999]  It just goes on and on.
[00:21:31.999 --> 00:21:36.981]  The guy's famous for covering up for the Clintons and Bush and Obama.
[00:21:36.981 --> 00:21:38.341]  Just unbelievable.
[00:21:38.341 --> 00:21:44.324]  Uranium being delivered in Moscow on tarmacs at midnight in a sleet in duffel bags.
[00:21:44.324 --> 00:21:48.386]  I mean, if Trump was doing that, I'd say hang him up by his toenails politically.
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:52.242]  But there's nothing there but pure Americana.
[00:21:52.242 --> 00:21:54.584]  There's nothing there but delivering.
[00:21:54.584 --> 00:21:57.366]  We're gonna get to that next segment.
[00:21:57.366 --> 00:22:06.412]  So, here's the Associated Press headline, here's the Fox News headline, here's the Reuters headline, even the CNN headline.
[00:22:06.412 --> 00:22:09.935]  Says federal judge blast Mueller's team.
[00:22:09.935 --> 00:22:11.256]  Well, what'd they blast him for?
[00:22:12.762 --> 00:22:18.366]  Federal judge, this is fraud, he accuses Mueller's team of lying, trying to target Trump.
[00:22:18.366 --> 00:22:21.308]  Come on, man, you just want to impeach him.
[00:22:21.308 --> 00:22:22.729]  That's the quote.
[00:22:22.729 --> 00:22:26.391]  And the judge went on to say, U.S.
[00:22:26.391 --> 00:22:27.432]  Judge T.S.
[00:22:27.432 --> 00:22:32.955]  Ellis III said, you don't really care about Manafort.
[00:22:32.955 --> 00:22:38.799]  You really care about what information Mr. Manafort can give you to lead to Mr. Trump and impeachment, or whatever.
[00:22:38.799 --> 00:22:41.181]  And he goes on to say, you lied.
[00:22:42.827 --> 00:23:01.600]  To get your warrants, and then goes into how there's no Russiagate information, and how he wants the memos redacted, and the FBI reports, because the judge is able to read them as a classification, even above the FBI at that level, and says, I want you to declassify this right now, or I'm going to do it.
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:04.662]  Because it doesn't say there's Russia evidence.
[00:23:04.662 --> 00:23:09.566]  It says you're covering it up, and your own agents were saying they didn't like what was going on.
[00:23:11.215 --> 00:23:19.061]  Imagine being FBI agents, even if you're Democrats, being ordered to make stuff up about the President-elect, because that's when they started getting scared.
[00:23:19.061 --> 00:23:25.045]  And that's why Clapper and Brennan went on TV and said, Trump will be out of office within weeks of being in.
[00:23:25.045 --> 00:23:25.866]  We're going to remove him.
[00:23:25.866 --> 00:23:26.286]  Don't worry.
[00:23:26.286 --> 00:23:27.607]  Everybody stay behind.
[00:23:27.607 --> 00:23:28.548]  Nobody leave.
[00:23:28.548 --> 00:23:31.630]  Don't follow his orders.
[00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:34.953]  That is in the Hill today, again.
[00:23:34.953 --> 00:23:38.175]  I told you back at the time this was going on.
[00:23:38.175 --> 00:23:40.497]  Hayden says don't follow orders from the President.
[00:23:42.665 --> 00:23:46.786]  And he says, do not work for the government under Trump.
[00:23:46.786 --> 00:23:48.227]  That's the Hill today.
[00:23:48.227 --> 00:23:48.847]  That's coming up.
[00:23:48.847 --> 00:23:50.447]  But that makes my point.
[00:23:50.447 --> 00:23:55.389]  Federal judge goes on to say you are unfettered.
[00:23:55.389 --> 00:24:00.951]  The Hill translates that to federal judge says Mueller is above the law or believes he is.
[00:24:00.951 --> 00:24:02.471]  Now, let me tell you what unfettered means.
[00:24:02.471 --> 00:24:04.432]  What have I called Mueller for a year and a half?
[00:24:05.345 --> 00:24:07.326]  Since Rosenstein put him in day one.
[00:24:07.326 --> 00:24:12.329]  This rogue group in the executive branch that the president had no power over, even though he has total power over it.
[00:24:12.329 --> 00:24:13.310]  That's rogue.
[00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:14.911]  They're rogue.
[00:24:14.911 --> 00:24:16.892]  They're runaway.
[00:24:16.892 --> 00:24:18.273]  They're stay-behind networks.
[00:24:18.273 --> 00:24:20.234]  These are legal terms.
[00:24:20.234 --> 00:24:24.756]  Well, what does unfettered mean in law?
[00:24:24.756 --> 00:24:28.198]  Look up blacks law, not just English or Oxford.
[00:24:28.198 --> 00:24:29.419]  Look up blacks.
[00:24:29.419 --> 00:24:30.940]  That'll be a legal definition.
[00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:31.620]  I know what it's going to say.
[00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:32.521]  It's going to say rogue.
[00:24:34.225 --> 00:24:35.506]  Now, listen to this.
[00:24:35.506 --> 00:24:36.707]  That's a term in law.
[00:24:36.707 --> 00:24:37.648]  Rogue agent.
[00:24:37.648 --> 00:24:40.030]  Rogue government.
[00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:44.934]  Unfetter, the judge said.
[00:24:44.934 --> 00:24:54.323]  It means unrestrained, unrestricted, unconstrained, uninhibited, rampant, unbridled, free from law.
[00:24:54.323 --> 00:24:55.804]  That's what it means.
[00:24:59.013 --> 00:25:01.494]  Mueller is his own branch of government.
[00:25:01.494 --> 00:25:07.338]  A few months ago, six months ago, I called him Emperor Mueller.
[00:25:07.338 --> 00:25:14.822]  And Slate and Salon and Raw Story and Newsweek, all that headline saying Jones is insane.
[00:25:14.822 --> 00:25:17.983]  Search engine and click web to show people.
[00:25:17.983 --> 00:25:20.305]  Alex Jones thinks Mueller's an emperor.
[00:25:20.985 --> 00:25:22.346]  Or thinks he's a king.
[00:25:22.346 --> 00:25:25.168]  Just type in Alex Jones, and they're like crazy articles.
[00:25:25.168 --> 00:25:26.589]  Jones has gone crazy.
[00:25:26.589 --> 00:25:29.271]  He believes Mueller's an actual royalty.
[00:25:29.271 --> 00:25:30.612]  No jerks.
[00:25:30.612 --> 00:25:32.514]  He thinks he's a king.
[00:25:32.514 --> 00:25:36.717]  Fourth branch of government, outside of executive, judicial, and legislative.
[00:25:36.717 --> 00:25:43.642]  They've announced that they're separate, just like the Federal Reserve has announced on C-SPAN before, and on NPR, and on PBS.
[00:25:43.642 --> 00:25:44.322]  I've got all the clips.
[00:25:45.243 --> 00:25:53.310]  Alan Greenspan famously, as he left, said, we are a fourth branch of government, separate from the other three, and no one can constrain us, not even the people.
[00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:55.652]  That's crazy talk.
[00:25:55.652 --> 00:25:57.433]  The three branches constrain each other.
[00:25:57.433 --> 00:26:00.356]  A fourth would be a king.
[00:26:00.356 --> 00:26:01.657]  There it is.
[00:26:01.657 --> 00:26:02.197]  Media matters.
[00:26:02.197 --> 00:26:03.738]  That's George Soros' mouth.
[00:26:03.738 --> 00:26:04.699]  Alex Jones.
[00:26:04.699 --> 00:26:08.643]  There's a plot to install Robert Mueller as the first king of America.
[00:26:08.643 --> 00:26:10.124]  The quote is the first king of America.
[00:26:12.335 --> 00:26:26.826]  Yeah, I said he'd be a rogue element, able to do whatever he wants, and would basically set up the police, the federal police, like a third world country, or what happened in Rome, as a new rogue, runaway, controlled element.
[00:26:26.826 --> 00:26:30.669]  Word for word what I said has now been said by the federal judge.
[00:26:30.669 --> 00:26:31.570]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:26:32.352 --> 00:26:50.916]  Now, it's not hard to know that, but we've got another federal judge over the Russian lawsuit where they're suing Stone, Trump, everybody, saying they're Russian agents, and the judge said, okay, here's the companies that you said did this, they're here, they want all the evidence.
[00:26:50.916 --> 00:26:53.957]  Mueller said, oh, we want to punt for six months, we may drop it.
[00:26:53.957 --> 00:26:58.178]  It was all just about filing that and saying everybody's Russian agents!
[00:27:00.782 --> 00:27:03.923]  So now the judge has called him out.
[00:27:03.923 --> 00:27:06.464]  On that, that's Politico.
[00:27:06.464 --> 00:27:12.806]  Judge rejects Mueller's request for delay in Russian troll farm case.
[00:27:12.806 --> 00:27:17.187]  Mueller probe might have to go dark until the midterm elections because of this.
[00:27:17.187 --> 00:27:22.029]  Wall Street Journal, they're panicking, they're pulling back, hoping you forget all these embarrassments.
[00:27:23.916 --> 00:27:44.844]  Remember they were going to be done by December, but all the memos about Andy McCabe, and Strzok, and his girlfriend, and the Pissgate dossier, the Steele dossier, and paying their wives millions of dollars in Fusion GPS to create the fake dossier, and the Justice Department's wives getting money, and McCabe getting a half million from Hillary.
[00:27:44.844 --> 00:27:46.725]  That was embarrassing six months ago!
[00:27:47.385 --> 00:27:52.828]  So they just kind of took Mueller out of the news and went into Stormy Daniels and women for four or five months.
[00:27:52.828 --> 00:27:56.210]  And now they're going back into Mueller and think you don't remember that.
[00:27:56.210 --> 00:28:08.436]  And now because the judges have said it's all a giant fraud to impeach the president with no evidence and that the judges have all the documents that are secret but they want the FBI to release them or Congress will, they'll go back to the Bimbos or something else or that he's senile.
[00:28:08.436 --> 00:28:14.760]  And then as soon as they think you've forgotten about that, they'll be right back with we're all Russian agents because we love America and want to see the country great.
[00:28:16.158 --> 00:28:20.482]  And just cut the Russian fuel supply off and are devastating them and massing troops on their border.
[00:28:20.482 --> 00:28:22.604]  And yeah, yeah, Trump's really with the Russians.
[00:28:22.604 --> 00:28:23.785]  Give me a freaking break.
[00:28:23.785 --> 00:28:29.330]  The globalists are with all these foreign powers selling nation states out and they don't know what to do.
[00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:30.812]  They're panicking.
[00:28:30.812 --> 00:28:32.673]  But Alan Dershowitz is right.
[00:28:32.673 --> 00:28:36.096]  Giuliani, I got to say, man, is just he's given Trump bad advice.
[00:28:36.096 --> 00:28:36.877]  This is weird.
[00:28:36.877 --> 00:28:39.820]  And Dershowitz says Trump team playing in Mueller's hands.
[00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:41.581]  The president needs Alan Dershowitz.
[00:28:42.382 --> 00:28:43.462]  He's a real lawyer.
[00:28:43.462 --> 00:28:44.363]  He's a Democrat.
[00:28:44.363 --> 00:28:45.463]  He's perfect.
[00:28:45.463 --> 00:28:48.044]  And he's got a track record of being accurate.
[00:28:48.044 --> 00:28:50.205]  Trump needs Alan Dershowitz.
[00:28:50.205 --> 00:28:50.945]  Good Lord!
[00:28:50.945 --> 00:28:52.425]  And he needs to start moving.
[00:28:52.425 --> 00:28:55.526]  By the way, Nunes is talking about contempt on the Attorney General.
[00:28:55.526 --> 00:28:56.627]  Absolutely!
[00:28:56.627 --> 00:28:57.627]  Lock Sessions up!

[00:30:18.914 --> 00:30:19.694]  The revolution.

[00:30:38.102 --> 00:30:40.903]  That's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[00:30:40.903 --> 00:30:43.124]  InfoWarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:30:45.305 --> 00:30:52.578]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.

[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:03.163]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:31:03.163 --> 00:31:04.944]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:31:04.944 --> 00:31:16.212]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:31:16.972 --> 00:31:26.159]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:31:26.159 --> 00:31:37.226]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:31:37.226 --> 00:31:39.848]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[00:31:39.848 --> 00:31:41.569]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:31:41.569 --> 00:31:46.373]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase,
[00:31:46.613 --> 00:31:51.536]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:31:51.536 --> 00:31:54.198]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:31:54.198 --> 00:31:58.881]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[00:32:16.813 --> 00:32:21.694]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:32:21.694 --> 00:32:28.475]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:28.475 --> 00:32:35.656]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:32:35.656 --> 00:32:42.657]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:32:42.657 --> 00:32:46.578]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:32:46.618 --> 00:32:47.898]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:29.986]  Look, here's the bottom line.
[00:33:29.986 --> 00:33:37.329]  Jeff Sessions did a great job in the Senate exposing gun control and open borders plans by George W. Bush three or four times.
[00:33:37.329 --> 00:33:38.630]  And I thought he was a great Attorney General.
[00:33:39.517 --> 00:33:44.461]  But since then, he has been involved in massive classical dereliction of duty.
[00:33:44.461 --> 00:33:53.547]  He has openly, in so many ways, protected this whole rogue group, Rosenstein, that set up this new power structure and tricked the president into signing it.
[00:33:53.547 --> 00:33:54.528]  He can always negate that.
[00:33:54.528 --> 00:33:55.649]  It's his branch of government.
[00:33:56.309 --> 00:34:06.914]  And now you've got Mueller with all these federal judges over Russiagate saying, you're lied, we caught you, we have the documents, you are unfettered, meaning rogue government, trying to overthrow the president.
[00:34:06.914 --> 00:34:09.975]  Just like Nunes says he's going for contempt charges this week.
[00:34:09.975 --> 00:34:12.276]  That's holding him in contempt, the Attorney General.
[00:34:12.836 --> 00:34:12.996]  I don't
[00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:35.252]  But the wheels are coming off.
[00:34:35.252 --> 00:34:40.741]  That's why Mueller is set to announce, AP's reporting, that he may go dormant until the midterms are over.
[00:34:40.741 --> 00:34:46.551]  Not because they don't want to unsettle an election, but because they want you to forget about the devastating information that just came out.
[00:34:48.507 --> 00:34:54.514]  We're going to cut that little live piece and put it on the front of the last segment when we put that out because it needs to go viral.
[00:34:54.514 --> 00:34:55.755]  Owen Schroyer's here.
[00:34:55.755 --> 00:34:57.077]  Just got back from the NRA.
[00:34:57.077 --> 00:34:57.677]  Did a great job.
[00:34:57.677 --> 00:35:04.245]  He'll ride the shotgun with me in the next hour when we're set to have Michael Schneider in a very close race.
[00:35:04.245 --> 00:35:05.246]  And I mean, I'm having him.
[00:35:05.246 --> 00:35:06.547]  I don't usually focus on one race.
[00:35:07.088 --> 00:35:07.388]  I don't
[00:35:28.243 --> 00:35:33.906]  The situation here with Mueller, I mean, this is completely rogue, as I've always said.
[00:35:33.906 --> 00:35:36.887]  If you know law, this is completely criminal.
[00:35:36.887 --> 00:35:40.529]  Even CNN admits that he, quote, gets rough with people and does whatever he wants.
[00:35:40.529 --> 00:35:41.730]  He totally violates the law.
[00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:43.131]  They lie to federal judges.
[00:35:43.131 --> 00:35:44.991]  He's up to his eyeballs with the Russians.
[00:35:44.991 --> 00:35:50.734]  He's fighting for his life as a Russian agent on Russian boards with Russian uranium transfers.
[00:35:50.734 --> 00:35:53.136]  Mueller needs to get his ass SWAT teamed.
[00:35:53.136 --> 00:35:55.477]  Clapper, Brennan, all these arrogant people.
[00:35:55.477 --> 00:35:57.338]  Hayden's back in the news, former head of the CIA.
[00:35:58.258 --> 00:36:02.680]  Threatening people, saying you better not work for Trump in the government or we'll get you.
[00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:07.003]  Well that's what they're doing behind the scenes, is blocking with rogue government.
[00:36:07.003 --> 00:36:14.026]  And it's getting to the point now, these guys work for a foreign power, the globalists, and they're allied with the Communist Chinese and Davos.
[00:36:14.026 --> 00:36:19.389]  I'm serious, it's getting to the point where if they try to remove the president, man, he's got every right and the duty.
[00:36:20.069 --> 00:36:23.152]  It's getting in a dereliction of duty area for Trump.
[00:36:23.152 --> 00:36:30.598]  If we don't start moving on these people, because they're moving on us extra-judicially, they're the globalists, and you gotta fight fire with fire.
[00:36:31.294 --> 00:36:39.019]  Well, over the weekend I was calling Robert Mueller the Deep State President, because he kind of seemed to be the one in charge of the Deep State, propping it up.
[00:36:39.019 --> 00:36:49.587]  But now, as things are developing to the close of this weekend, and we move forward to next week when I think you're going to hear more from Devin Nunes, more from these intelligence communities, more from even federal judges perhaps,
[00:36:50.427 --> 00:36:53.969]  Now I'm trying to wonder, was Robert Mueller the Tokyo Rose of the Globalist?
[00:36:53.969 --> 00:36:56.911]  Was Robert Mueller the Tokyo Rose of the Deep State?
[00:36:56.911 --> 00:37:01.213]  Here he is, the Russian investigation, like Trump really is.
[00:37:01.213 --> 00:37:06.816]  So he props this false narrative about the media and all the... And in a modern sense, that'd be Baghdad, Bob.
[00:37:07.416 --> 00:37:12.379]  Okay, so yeah, but it's basically like you use all the media outlets to act like the Mueller investigation is real.
[00:37:12.379 --> 00:37:14.239]  That's what you got from Operation Mockingbird.
[00:37:14.239 --> 00:37:17.841]  That got exposed from all the JFK files that Trump released.
[00:37:17.841 --> 00:37:21.763]  And then you have Mueller doing this, you know, fake investigation that they act as real.
[00:37:21.763 --> 00:37:23.304]  He's totally rogue, like you said.
[00:37:23.664 --> 00:37:25.426]  Nobody's buying it anymore.
[00:37:25.426 --> 00:37:31.853]  Any leftist or liberal with half wit understands that the Mueller investigation is fake and there is no Russian collusion.
[00:37:31.853 --> 00:37:39.401]  It's just the radical fringe elements of anyone, whether you want to say leftists, Americans, or anyone around the world that believes this crap.
[00:37:39.401 --> 00:37:40.662]  So it's like, what comes next?
[00:37:41.502 --> 00:37:43.263]  Who actually brings Mueller down?
[00:37:43.263 --> 00:37:45.684]  Who actually brings Mueller and this investigation to an end?
[00:37:45.684 --> 00:38:00.551]  And notice, as soon as the wheels came off, they totally switched to Stormy Daniels, raided his lawyer, which we now know was directed by Mueller, with illegal wiretaps, because they now admit it was not the scope of Russiagate, and they lied to the judges to get it on that lawyer, and knew it wasn't there.
[00:38:00.551 --> 00:38:01.872]  And it's all coming out!
[00:38:01.872 --> 00:38:03.933]  And what does this have to do with anything?
[00:38:03.933 --> 00:38:05.494]  What does this have to do with an election?
[00:38:05.734 --> 00:38:07.776]  What does this have to do with Russian collusion?
[00:38:07.776 --> 00:38:11.440]  And it changes the subject from, yeah, about what's in the WikiLeaks!
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:12.502]  Total crime!
[00:38:12.502 --> 00:38:13.483]  Illegal servers!
[00:38:13.483 --> 00:38:14.524]  Paper play!
[00:38:14.524 --> 00:38:17.207]  Hundreds of millions laundered!
[00:38:17.207 --> 00:38:17.968]  It's incredible!
[00:38:18.772 --> 00:38:21.253]  And they will tell you not to read that on CNN.
[00:38:21.253 --> 00:38:23.174]  Well, you don't have the right to read that.
[00:38:23.174 --> 00:38:24.475]  We do here at CNN.
[00:38:24.475 --> 00:38:35.640]  Well, let's change the subject to all these people that have the economy roaring, building up our military, defending our border, crushing political correctness, getting us out of the TPP, renegotiating NAFTA and GATT.
[00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:36.701]  They're the Russians.
[00:38:36.701 --> 00:38:37.882]  Yeah, right.
[00:38:37.882 --> 00:38:43.765]  You're the globalists that have had your foot on our neck forever, and we've got it off our neck, and we're bleeding, but we're getting up, and you're scared.
[00:38:43.765 --> 00:38:46.606]  You better be scared, because we're about to kick your ass politically.
[00:38:46.886 --> 00:38:52.530]  If this isn't the Twilight Zone, if this isn't 1984 in the flesh, I don't know what could be.
[00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:53.951]  I really don't know what could be.
[00:38:55.868 --> 00:38:57.069]  There's nothing here.
[00:38:57.069 --> 00:38:58.090]  Think about this, Alex, again.
[00:38:58.090 --> 00:39:06.016]  If they come down on Trump for obstruction of justice, and say, oh, now Mueller's looking at obstruction of justice, the latest out of the Tokyo Roses.
[00:39:06.016 --> 00:39:07.918]  Well, what is obstructing of justice?
[00:39:07.918 --> 00:39:08.758]  What is the justice?
[00:39:08.758 --> 00:39:10.560]  Russian collusion isn't even a crime.
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:14.363]  And if you're saying there was any proof of Russian collusion, that it would be hacked and slaughtered.
[00:39:14.363 --> 00:39:15.364]  That's why they always call it collusion.
[00:39:15.364 --> 00:39:22.870]  It's like saying, well, you didn't cheat on your wife, but once you shook hands with a lady and kind of laughed and giggled at her and winked at her at the water cooler.
[00:39:23.567 --> 00:39:26.129]  You're like, okay, I did wink at Betty Lou.
[00:39:26.129 --> 00:39:28.270]  She is hot, but I didn't shoot on my wife.
[00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:30.412]  It's not illegal.
[00:39:30.412 --> 00:39:33.214]  And there wasn't even winking at the Russians going on.
[00:39:33.214 --> 00:39:40.639]  Meanwhile, Mueller and Hillary, if you want to use a sexual analogy, they had the Russians' legs up behind Russia's ears.
[00:39:40.639 --> 00:39:44.622]  And there was a gang rape going on to get that Russian money to then rape America.
[00:39:44.622 --> 00:39:48.425]  I mean, there was a line out the door, if you want to use a sexual allegory.
[00:39:48.425 --> 00:39:50.246]  So why won't they turn over their servers?
[00:39:51.047 --> 00:39:52.528]  You want to talk about obstruction of justice?
[00:39:52.528 --> 00:39:57.489]  Well, why don't you prove it was Russia that so-called hacked the DNC, which you can't even prove.
[00:39:57.489 --> 00:40:09.314]  So, they obstruct justice, they collude with Russia, they lose the election, throws the entire thing into a spiral panic, and then somehow they still have their elements of the deep state remaining, put Mueller up.
[00:40:09.694 --> 00:40:10.895]  Sessions' hands are tied.
[00:40:10.895 --> 00:40:11.716]  He recused himself.
[00:40:11.716 --> 00:40:15.438]  Trump says, I'm going to stay away from the Attorney General's office and the Justice Department.
[00:40:15.438 --> 00:40:16.419]  I'll let them work that out.
[00:40:16.419 --> 00:40:18.921]  I don't want to have any bad press about me doing this.
[00:40:18.921 --> 00:40:21.963]  And so it's all this fake thing hanging over our heads.
[00:40:21.963 --> 00:40:26.366]  And still Trump is doing everything he can to fulfill his promises and make America great, like he said.
[00:40:26.366 --> 00:40:35.432]  And it's perfect for these globalist traitors that have sold us out, the Chinese, the Russians, you name it, to then point at all of us that are actually bringing the country back and say, look, they're the enemies.
[00:40:35.432 --> 00:40:36.373]  They're the problem.
[00:40:36.373 --> 00:40:37.054]  It's incredible.
[00:40:37.774 --> 00:40:44.836]  Well, and that's the problem, too, where they tell me, I go out and they'll say, hey, you're causing a divide.
[00:40:44.836 --> 00:40:46.016]  You're dividing this country.
[00:40:46.016 --> 00:40:46.757]  You're fake news.
[00:40:46.757 --> 00:40:48.657]  And I'm like, wait a second, hold up.
[00:40:48.657 --> 00:40:56.919]  How about a fake investigation that has a bunch of the population worrying that Russia is behind the election of Trump?
[00:40:56.919 --> 00:41:00.720]  I had a high level Democrat that I ran into on the street when I was downtown Friday taking care of business.
[00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:02.161]  Go, Alex, I like your show.
[00:41:03.321 --> 00:41:04.743]  But this is the least trusted
[00:41:26.744 --> 00:41:28.306]  The television media has ever been.
[00:41:28.306 --> 00:41:29.228]  Even the person that would believe that.
[00:41:29.228 --> 00:41:30.349]  And then they blame Trump for that.
[00:41:30.349 --> 00:41:32.152]  They go, you're gonna get journalists killed.
[00:41:32.152 --> 00:41:35.837]  No, you're lying and being globalist traitors is why people hate you.
[00:41:35.837 --> 00:41:38.621]  Take responsibility for it.
[00:41:38.621 --> 00:41:40.483]  Well, I think the worst this gets...
[00:41:41.812 --> 00:41:44.755]  In some silver lining sense, the better it gets.
[00:41:44.755 --> 00:41:48.520]  Because more people, I think, are understanding how ridiculous Mueller is.
[00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:51.383]  A lot of these people really expected there to be something.
[00:41:51.383 --> 00:41:57.650]  They really had Mueller as this idol, this god of justice, of saving America from Trump.
[00:41:58.070 --> 00:41:59.571]  And he really has fallen now.
[00:41:59.571 --> 00:42:05.595]  So what are they going to do as it's a nothing burger, except he committed all these crimes and did wiretap and lied about it?
[00:42:05.595 --> 00:42:07.957]  What are they going to do as their God descends in flames?
[00:42:07.957 --> 00:42:11.279]  Well, I think that there's two options that we know probably are on the table.
[00:42:11.279 --> 00:42:15.042]  One is we've seen it in the emails where they talk about, we've got our guys ready.
[00:42:15.042 --> 00:42:18.364]  If they fire Mueller, if they fire Rosenstein, we'll riot on the streets.
[00:42:18.364 --> 00:42:19.765]  Democrats sending out emails.
[00:42:19.765 --> 00:42:26.810]  And then you have to say, OK, on the larger scale, on the real globalist controlled deep state scale, do they launch some sort of false flag?
[00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:29.351]  You know, I mean, who knows what they could do?
[00:42:29.351 --> 00:42:33.574]  Cyber false flag, bio false flag, uh, you know, a typical false flag.
[00:42:33.574 --> 00:42:34.955]  Oh yeah, they're going to pull something big.
[00:42:34.955 --> 00:42:36.956]  And we're going to talk more about that coming up.
[00:42:36.956 --> 00:42:38.658]  Because that's, yeah, they're not going to give up.
[00:42:38.658 --> 00:42:40.339]  Look at the arrogance of the deep state.
[00:42:40.339 --> 00:42:43.841]  The Congress, the President, the voters trying to overthrow our election.
[00:42:43.841 --> 00:42:45.562]  This is a coup against America.
[00:42:45.562 --> 00:42:47.724]  A coup against our electoral process.
[00:42:47.724 --> 00:42:51.166]  Where they say, no, you didn't really vote for Trump, the Russians did it.
[00:42:51.166 --> 00:42:52.787]  What a load of baloney.
[00:42:52.787 --> 00:42:56.950]  We'll be back with the highlights of the incredible NRA event and the gun grabbers.
[00:42:58.711 --> 00:43:01.051]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[00:43:58.348 --> 00:44:02.629]  I was just about to walk out of the studio to pick my children up and I got some bad news.
[00:44:02.629 --> 00:44:10.652]  For the second time in the five and a half year history of Survival Shield X2, our flagship product, we are having supply chain problems.
[00:44:10.652 --> 00:44:12.572]  And this may be the last batch of this.
[00:44:12.572 --> 00:44:19.194]  We have deep earth crystal source that's so pure that it actually turns into purple gas in the atmosphere.
[00:44:19.194 --> 00:44:21.715]  And so in our own search to get the purest form,
[00:44:22.455 --> 00:44:31.068]  We discovered that oil companies and gas drilling companies had a byproduct that they were selling to pharmaceutical companies and also drug makers that they used to make drugs.
[00:44:31.068 --> 00:44:34.934]  And once they figure out there's a market, they start jacking up the price.
[00:44:36.229 --> 00:44:39.470]  We're offering it still 25% off until it sells out.
[00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:43.652]  Hopefully, just like the last time this happened a few years ago, it's not an issue and we do get more.
[00:44:43.652 --> 00:44:49.574]  But right now, we are not able to secure the crystals that produce the purest iodine in the world.
[00:44:49.574 --> 00:44:54.236]  But what it does is for stamina, libido, focus, energy, it's really amazing.
[00:44:54.236 --> 00:44:57.817]  Survival Shield X2 at m4warstore.com and m4warslife.com.
[00:44:59.321 --> 00:45:08.063]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[00:45:08.063 --> 00:45:08.583]  That's right.

[00:45:28.148 --> 00:45:28.348]  Woo!
[00:45:28.348 --> 00:45:29.389]  That's what I'm talking about.
[00:45:29.389 --> 00:45:38.134]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[00:45:38.134 --> 00:45:47.720]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.

[00:47:20.766 --> 00:47:23.569]  Welcome back!
[00:47:23.569 --> 00:47:29.874]  I'm Alex Jones, Owen Schroyer, the amazing co-host with the also pretty awesome Roger Stone.
[00:47:29.874 --> 00:47:31.035]  Weekdays at 3 p.m.
[00:47:31.035 --> 00:47:31.435]  Central.
[00:47:31.435 --> 00:47:43.465]  A lot of our radio affiliates are picking up the show, but I gotta say, TV affiliate-wise, ladies and gentlemen, 300 plus TV stations and over 70 cable systems.
[00:47:44.815 --> 00:47:50.948]  Some rural, some big cities in just the last six months or less have picked up the broadcast.
[00:47:50.948 --> 00:47:53.093]  So the real sleeper is TV.
[00:47:53.093 --> 00:47:54.937]  And it's just amazing.
[00:47:56.496 --> 00:47:57.477]  Very, very exciting.
[00:47:57.477 --> 00:48:04.083]  We're now 10 hours a day live weekdays and only two hours on Sundays here, but we're about to add a bunch of live weekend shows here in the next few months.
[00:48:04.083 --> 00:48:06.846]  We're adding more crew, building up the operation here.
[00:48:06.846 --> 00:48:14.133]  That's why when you buy t-shirts and books and films and water filters and air filters, all the best systems at Infowarsstore.com, you fund this operation.
[00:48:14.133 --> 00:48:19.057]  We also have great supplements, DNA Force Plus with the PQQ and the Bio
[00:48:19.878 --> 00:48:20.580]  We're good to go.
[00:48:28.123 --> 00:48:32.567]  And it's 50% off, so you can try the new formula for a limited time.
[00:48:32.567 --> 00:48:35.750]  Also, our fluoride-free toothpaste is running low.
[00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:37.291]  We have it for adults and children.
[00:48:37.291 --> 00:48:39.553]  It's 4 to 5 of colloidal silver and iodine.
[00:48:39.553 --> 00:48:43.316]  It is 33% off, despite the fact that the toothpaste is running low.
[00:48:43.316 --> 00:48:51.183]  The mouthwash is not running low, or the immune gargle, or the small spray bottle that I use, not just in my mouth, but topically as well.
[00:48:51.183 --> 00:48:53.625]  It's amazing with the colloidal silver, the iodine, and more.
[00:48:53.625 --> 00:48:55.507]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[00:48:57.807 --> 00:48:59.789]  But that special is about to have to end.
[00:48:59.789 --> 00:49:04.933]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or AAA253-3139.
[00:49:04.933 --> 00:49:07.334]  It is your purchases that make it all possible.
[00:49:07.334 --> 00:49:09.516]  So thank you for the support and your prayers.
[00:49:09.516 --> 00:49:13.779]  And please support the local radio or TV station you're watching or listening to.
[00:49:13.779 --> 00:49:17.302]  Please support the local station by spreading the word about it.
[00:49:17.302 --> 00:49:18.983]  Your local business become a sponsor.
[00:49:19.944 --> 00:49:29.146]  On it, I can't tell you separately, on local TV and local cable, how many businesses I see, restaurants, you name it, that are incredibly successful.
[00:49:29.146 --> 00:49:43.750]  And I remember 15 years ago, 16 years ago, when I was number one on the city of Austin on FM Affiliate, that now is music, and they asked me how my show in just a few years went to number one when the station had no ratings in the paper.
[00:49:44.847 --> 00:49:46.628]  And I said, well, I did a lot of promotion.
[00:49:46.628 --> 00:49:48.730]  You know, the show was hard-hitting.
[00:49:48.730 --> 00:49:56.195]  But I said, also, I ran TV ads by the tens of thousands on local cable.
[00:49:56.195 --> 00:50:03.519]  And I remember I had a buddy who worked at Time Warner, and I was asking, he had accounts there as a salesman, but he also did engineering.
[00:50:03.519 --> 00:50:06.101]  And I said, how much is an ad, say, during Discovery Channel?
[00:50:06.101 --> 00:50:10.684]  He said, well, if you buy a big package, they're $2 a piece at primetime.
[00:50:10.684 --> 00:50:12.525]  And I'm like, Discovery Channel has huge viewers.
[00:50:12.525 --> 00:50:13.586]  He goes, I know.
[00:50:13.586 --> 00:50:14.347]  I ran ads.
[00:50:15.687 --> 00:50:18.968]  I ran advertising for my show on local cable.
[00:50:18.968 --> 00:50:25.430]  I'm just saying, local cable, local TV is one of the best places to advertise, just like radio.
[00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:28.331]  But cable, people just ignore that there's local ads on it.
[00:50:28.331 --> 00:50:29.112]  It's just waiting.
[00:50:29.112 --> 00:50:33.253]  It's like, you just go to these huge buys, buy that, a lot of it's just computerized.
[00:50:33.253 --> 00:50:35.674]  I ran ads a few years ago on Fox.
[00:50:37.003 --> 00:50:39.784]  Uh, but you gotta buy the remnants is what they're called overnight.
[00:50:39.784 --> 00:50:41.744]  And then Politico's got involved and blocked me doing it.
[00:50:41.744 --> 00:50:42.945]  That was through Google.
[00:50:42.945 --> 00:50:43.925]  That's why it made me so mad.
[00:50:43.925 --> 00:50:45.865]  A couple years ago when Google blocked us from advertising.
[00:50:45.865 --> 00:50:47.506]  You could go and computerize to Google.
[00:50:47.506 --> 00:50:48.526]  Have your ad, it's approved.
[00:50:48.526 --> 00:50:50.807]  Uh, just that it's, you know, standards and quality.
[00:50:50.807 --> 00:50:52.787]  And then it runs on national cable.
[00:50:52.787 --> 00:50:54.688]  See, I'm digressing here in the inside baseball.
[00:50:54.688 --> 00:50:55.588]  I'm sorry.
[00:50:55.588 --> 00:50:57.548]  It's just having the time to jack with all this.
[00:50:57.548 --> 00:50:59.329]  It's just, please support our local affiliates.
[00:50:59.329 --> 00:50:59.529]  Okay.
[00:50:59.909 --> 00:51:00.809]  Let's shift gears now.
[00:51:00.809 --> 00:51:09.353]  I'm going to get more into this next hour, more into the whole Mueller thing and how Rosie O'Donnell's been caught committing more crimes in elections, way beyond Dinesh D'Souza's so-called crime.
[00:51:09.353 --> 00:51:10.513]  But will she go to jail?
[00:51:10.513 --> 00:51:10.893]  No!
[00:51:10.893 --> 00:51:16.556]  Because Republicans let Democrats run wild, they let them persecute Christians, they let them persecute everybody.
[00:51:16.556 --> 00:51:21.418]  Also next hour, Amazon bars Christians from Amazon.
[00:51:21.418 --> 00:51:22.618]  That's mainstream news.
[00:51:22.618 --> 00:51:28.701]  I mean, oh yeah, just like Google and Apple are taking Christian holidays off their calendars.
[00:51:29.361 --> 00:51:33.325]  And Google won't do doodles for holidays that are Christian, but they'll do them for Muslims.
[00:51:33.325 --> 00:51:34.826]  I mean, they're out to get us.
[00:51:34.826 --> 00:51:36.568]  Owen Schroer.
[00:51:36.568 --> 00:51:49.159]  Well, it is kind of shocking when you see that, but this video that we're about to play is a perfect example of the double standard and the double think, if you want to use the 1984 terminology, of what we're dealing with with people on the street.
[00:51:49.159 --> 00:51:50.480]  Now, I want to say this.
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:51.601]  I want to clarify something, Alex.
[00:51:51.601 --> 00:51:52.342]  I think you'll agree with this.
[00:51:53.487 --> 00:52:03.495]  These street protesters and the vermin that come out and do these protests are the fringe elements, and they really give true liberals a bad name.
[00:52:03.495 --> 00:52:14.484]  There are people out there that watch us that just have different views, that land on the left side of things, but they're not crazy, they're not fringe, and these people really kind of drown those voices out and make them look bad.
[00:52:14.484 --> 00:52:17.126]  But we're not just selectively cherry-picking them.
[00:52:17.126 --> 00:52:22.210]  You go to any Democrat event, more and more, more and more, I'd say half of them are like Day of the Dead.
[00:52:22.210 --> 00:52:26.194]  And that's one thing that they will deny, that I say, no, you don't understand, I don't edit this stuff.
[00:52:26.194 --> 00:52:27.596]  We don't have to edit this stuff.
[00:52:27.596 --> 00:52:31.340]  I can go live for an hour, two hours at one of these events, and it's the same thing every time.
[00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:34.123]  They curse at you, they spit on you, they swing on you.
[00:52:34.123 --> 00:52:36.786]  They call the police and get you thrown out of the public park line.
[00:52:36.786 --> 00:52:40.810]  They box you, they literally, you know, they put their butt in, I don't know, it's just weird stuff that they do.
[00:52:40.810 --> 00:52:42.131]  They always hit you from down low.
[00:52:43.272 --> 00:52:46.494]  Honestly, it's absurd to even think about this, but this is what they do.
[00:52:46.494 --> 00:52:47.735]  But here's the example.
[00:52:47.735 --> 00:52:52.919]  Now, I will say that I was about 10 minutes late because I was rallying a group of people.
[00:52:52.919 --> 00:52:53.959]  I had about 50 people.
[00:52:53.959 --> 00:53:03.846]  I was there with about 10 people, and then I went to this other NRA event where there was a group meet, and I brought about 50 to 100 people over to the park, and we were going to bullhorn Alyssa Milano's speech.
[00:53:03.846 --> 00:53:06.387]  Unfortunately, we missed it by 10 minutes.
[00:53:06.387 --> 00:53:09.710]  Otherwise, we would have been right there bullhorning when that video went viral.
[00:53:10.450 --> 00:53:10.670]  I don't
[00:53:26.616 --> 00:53:28.497]  They were like, look, you know, we know what you're doing out here.
[00:53:28.497 --> 00:53:30.238]  We'll try to help you, but hey, you gotta go.
[00:53:30.238 --> 00:53:32.660]  But yeah, this guy, you could tell, this is a totally different event.
[00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:36.543]  They hire this guy to be a thug, intimidate people out there, and brag about his power.
[00:53:36.543 --> 00:53:39.965]  But that's a violation of law to say, yeah, I'm armed.
[00:53:39.965 --> 00:53:42.146]  Now move, go, go, go.
[00:53:42.146 --> 00:53:44.608]  And then they say to him, you're with Infowars, aren't you?
[00:53:44.608 --> 00:53:46.970]  If you listen to the audio, the guy goes, no, I'm not.
[00:53:46.970 --> 00:53:49.291]  So again, they just totally, here, let's go ahead and roll.
[00:53:49.291 --> 00:53:50.532]  Oh, and then there's that guy, too.
[00:53:50.532 --> 00:53:51.413]  Oh, don't even get started on that.
[00:53:51.413 --> 00:53:52.273]  The little orange guy?
[00:53:52.273 --> 00:53:53.574]  Yeah, yeah, the little munchkin.
[00:53:53.574 --> 00:53:54.435]  Well, goblin creature.
[00:53:54.435 --> 00:53:55.235]  He was a total goblin.
[00:53:55.235 --> 00:53:56.316]  We had a goblin leader.
[00:53:56.576 --> 00:53:57.417]  He was a cult leader.
[00:53:57.417 --> 00:54:00.278]  He came over and shut down the conversation that we're going to play later.
[00:54:00.278 --> 00:54:02.220]  I gotta say he's handsome, though.
[00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:04.621]  Well, that could... Start it over.
[00:54:04.621 --> 00:54:05.922]  Start it over.
[00:54:05.922 --> 00:54:09.844]  This is Melissa Milano, a B-star from the 80s.
[00:54:09.844 --> 00:54:11.165]  No one even knows who she is.
[00:54:11.165 --> 00:54:13.427]  She's there with like a hundred people to hear her speak.
[00:54:13.427 --> 00:54:17.549]  Some fellow walks up nicely, says to the guys that look like security, hey, are you armed security?
[00:54:17.549 --> 00:54:18.850]  They turn around and go, get out of here.
[00:54:18.850 --> 00:54:19.931]  They go, yeah, we're armed.
[00:54:19.931 --> 00:54:20.631]  Get out of here.
[00:54:20.631 --> 00:54:21.252]  Get out of here.
[00:54:21.252 --> 00:54:21.772]  Get out of here.
[00:54:21.772 --> 00:54:22.632]  You need to go.
[00:54:22.632 --> 00:54:23.653]  Total color of law.
[00:54:23.653 --> 00:54:24.574]  Here, let's go ahead and roll it.
[00:54:24.574 --> 00:54:24.834]  Here it is.
[00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:41.484]  Hey, you already told him.
[00:54:41.484 --> 00:54:47.786]  I'm not going to ask you to leave.
[00:54:47.786 --> 00:54:49.026]  Hey, pause.
[00:54:49.026 --> 00:54:50.947]  He keeps moving into his space.
[00:54:51.747 --> 00:54:56.992]  He keeps moving into his space, and I'm sorry, I've been there before the Dallas cops, or the Sheriff's Department, I didn't back off.
[00:54:56.992 --> 00:54:58.593]  And I'm just saying, I wouldn't have backed off.
[00:54:58.593 --> 00:54:59.894]  I'm not saying this guy's bad.
[00:54:59.894 --> 00:55:01.876]  Oh, and what would you have done if this guy was doing this?
[00:55:01.876 --> 00:55:04.939]  You know, you already had an anti-fuck with aim guns at you and everything, you didn't back down?
[00:55:04.939 --> 00:55:06.240]  You know, it's tough to say.
[00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:11.065]  I would say if it was this guy, I would not have probably backed down, because he's not law enforcement.
[00:55:11.065 --> 00:55:13.006]  He can't just intimidate me in a public space.
[00:55:13.006 --> 00:55:16.029]  Now, when Dallas police comes over to me and politely says, look, hey, we gotta talk.
[00:55:16.029 --> 00:55:16.630]  No, I get that!
[00:55:17.290 --> 00:55:17.950]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:17.950 --> 00:55:19.271]  But I'm talking about this guy.
[00:55:19.271 --> 00:55:20.412]  No, this guy, that's what I'm saying.
[00:55:20.412 --> 00:55:23.313]  This guy is totally out there just some... This is outside of law.
[00:55:23.313 --> 00:55:23.834]  Yeah, I agree.
[00:55:23.834 --> 00:55:24.694]  Let's back it up and roll it.
[00:55:24.694 --> 00:55:25.775]  Go ahead and roll it from here.
[00:55:25.775 --> 00:55:26.895]  Go ahead.
[00:55:26.895 --> 00:55:30.417]  How far do I have to go before I need you on the sidewalk?
[00:55:30.417 --> 00:55:31.698]  Yeah, he has no jurisdiction.
[00:55:31.698 --> 00:55:32.878]  He has no authority.
[00:55:32.878 --> 00:55:34.779]  Paul, let's back it up 20 seconds again.
[00:55:34.779 --> 00:55:36.800]  And he has a cult leader right next to him.
[00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:39.342]  Well... Who thinks he's cool because he probably met Alyssa Milano.
[00:55:39.342 --> 00:55:42.303]  No, what he has, that guy is probably the most handsome man I've ever seen.
[00:55:42.303 --> 00:55:43.824]  Don't talk bad about him.
[00:55:43.824 --> 00:55:44.845]  He's talking about a pumpkin head.
[00:55:45.464 --> 00:55:47.605]  No, listen, goblins have rights too.
[00:55:47.605 --> 00:55:50.086]  Go ahead and hit play.
[00:55:50.086 --> 00:55:53.508]  And then more people join in to push the poor guy out of there.
[00:55:53.508 --> 00:55:54.648]  This is totally illegal.
[00:55:54.648 --> 00:55:56.069]  What that guy did is illegal.
[00:55:56.069 --> 00:55:57.430]  You cannot, you cannot
[00:56:10.356 --> 00:56:11.436]  I forget what the code is.
[00:56:11.436 --> 00:56:12.357]  I can go pull it up.
[00:56:12.357 --> 00:56:13.517]  I read the code.
[00:56:13.517 --> 00:56:14.837]  No, it's in the articles about it.
[00:56:14.837 --> 00:56:16.918]  I mean, they're in his space saying, leave, leave, leave a park.
[00:56:16.918 --> 00:56:18.459]  He had to call the cops.
[00:56:18.459 --> 00:56:20.439]  You're intimidating someone with a firearm.
[00:56:20.439 --> 00:56:23.740]  You cannot do that in a public square when they're simply executing the right to free speech.
[00:56:23.740 --> 00:56:25.621]  And the guys are saying, yes, we're armed.
[00:56:25.621 --> 00:56:27.221]  You better get out of here.
[00:56:27.221 --> 00:56:28.222]  I don't want to edit this.
[00:56:28.222 --> 00:56:29.462]  Back it up 15 seconds.
[00:56:29.462 --> 00:56:30.402]  Play the thing unedited.
[00:56:30.402 --> 00:56:31.623]  Here it is.
[00:56:31.623 --> 00:56:32.123]  Back it up.
[00:56:32.123 --> 00:56:33.943]  Let's roll it again.
[00:56:33.943 --> 00:56:38.685]  We must prevent civilians from deploying weapons of war.
[00:56:42.957 --> 00:56:55.991]  How far do I have to go before I need you on the sidewalk?
[00:57:02.618 --> 00:57:03.900]  Yes, sir.
[00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:05.183]  Hypocrite!
[00:57:05.183 --> 00:57:06.465]  Alyssa, you're a hypocrite.
[00:57:06.465 --> 00:57:07.206]  But you are armed.
[00:57:07.206 --> 00:57:09.810]  You have armed security here.
[00:57:09.810 --> 00:57:11.473]  You have armed security here.
[00:57:14.172 --> 00:57:16.893]  And then you notice he says, you're with them fours.
[00:57:16.893 --> 00:57:18.493]  He goes, no, I'm not.
[00:57:18.493 --> 00:57:27.436]  I think that what's happening here is the guy that eventually forces him out was probably the head of security and they had a couple other people around the scene and he saw that one of them or two of them had firearms.
[00:57:27.436 --> 00:57:29.617]  So he said, hey, why do you guys have firearms?
[00:57:29.617 --> 00:57:31.717]  You're out here against the NRA, against firearms.
[00:57:31.717 --> 00:57:32.778]  Why do you have firearms?
[00:57:32.778 --> 00:57:35.799]  And that's when the head of security says, all right, I'm taking control of this situation.
[00:57:35.799 --> 00:57:36.699]  You've got to get out.
[00:57:37.375 --> 00:57:44.938]  I got a gun and I'm going to intimidate you out of your right to free speech and I'm going to break the law wantonly because I'm up here protecting Alyssa Milano, a beef celebrity of the New World Order.
[00:57:44.938 --> 00:57:46.239]  She's allowed to have guns.
[00:57:46.239 --> 00:57:46.999]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:46.999 --> 00:57:48.199]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:48.199 --> 00:57:51.181]  Second hour.

[00:59:43.663 --> 00:59:46.444]  Visit InfoWars.com today or call 888-253-3139.
[00:59:46.444 --> 00:59:47.785]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:08.530 --> 01:00:12.899]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:12.899 --> 01:00:15.204]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:00:16.696 --> 01:00:20.198]  So, me and Owen are running over each other, which is a good banner, because we're both so upset.
[01:00:20.198 --> 01:00:25.400]  To go up to the NRA convention, go outside, they got like 50 people out hearing, or maybe more.
[01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:26.481]  How big was the crowd?
[01:00:26.481 --> 01:00:29.282]  I'd say, at peak, probably maybe about 100, 120.
[01:00:29.282 --> 01:00:35.445]  Okay, so you go up, you're trying to get there, but before you can, somebody else is there.
[01:00:35.445 --> 01:00:37.306]  He says, hey, are you armed guards for her?
[01:00:37.306 --> 01:00:38.227]  You look like security.
[01:00:38.227 --> 01:00:39.247]  They say, you need to leave.
[01:00:39.247 --> 01:00:40.968]  Yeah, yeah, we're armed, you need to leave.
[01:00:40.968 --> 01:00:41.889]  You need to leave right now.
[01:00:42.861 --> 01:00:48.070]  Pushing him though, getting in his space, which is a violation of Texas code.
[01:00:48.070 --> 01:00:50.353]  I've seen in news articles about it.
[01:00:50.353 --> 01:00:50.894]  It's well known.
[01:00:53.174 --> 01:01:00.080]  The image here of armed men protecting an anti-gunner and then violating somebody's free speech, in my view, this is just too rich.
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:01.681]  They think they're better than us.
[01:01:01.681 --> 01:01:03.923]  They think they live by different rules than us.
[01:01:03.923 --> 01:01:05.104]  No, it's ridiculous.
[01:01:05.104 --> 01:01:12.811]  It's like the other video that we can play later where I'm talking to a girl and they virtue signal about the children that are lost during mass shootings, which I understand.
[01:01:12.811 --> 01:01:13.512]  That's horrible.
[01:01:13.512 --> 01:01:13.992]  That's awful.
[01:01:13.992 --> 01:01:14.813]  That's gut-wrenching.
[01:01:14.813 --> 01:01:16.114]  Nobody wants that.
[01:01:16.114 --> 01:01:19.197]  But they use that to prop up their anti-gun agenda.
[01:01:19.737 --> 01:01:22.398]  And so they'll say, well, we need to protect children from the next school shooting.
[01:01:22.398 --> 01:01:24.378]  You know, children are so precious, children are their future.
[01:01:24.378 --> 01:01:25.919]  You say, OK, well, I agree with that.
[01:01:25.919 --> 01:01:27.119]  So let's stop abortion.
[01:01:27.119 --> 01:01:27.999]  Well, how dare you?
[01:01:27.999 --> 01:01:28.719]  Abortion, good.
[01:01:28.719 --> 01:01:29.899]  These are unwanted children.
[01:01:29.899 --> 01:01:31.200]  You're like, what?
[01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:36.761]  How can you say there's unwanted children and then say that every child is the future one minute later?
[01:01:36.761 --> 01:01:39.422]  So like you said, I just laugh at it at this point.
[01:01:39.422 --> 01:01:43.423]  When listening to it and hearing it, it's just like, these people are so ridiculous.
[01:01:43.423 --> 01:01:44.423]  And it gets worse than that.
[01:01:44.423 --> 01:01:46.843]  We're going to play the bizarre abortion statement when we come back.
[01:01:46.843 --> 01:01:48.684]  But just in the time we have left in this segment,
[01:01:49.244 --> 01:01:53.767]  Sun Sentinel gun show draws crowds families despite Parkland shooting outcry.
[01:01:53.767 --> 01:02:01.573]  So because it's near the Parkland shooting, they're like, how dare you have a gun show, cancel it as if they're all murderers and as if they're all guilty.
[01:02:01.573 --> 01:02:07.557]  Well, if somebody runs over somebody with a Ford F-150 or a rental truck, we don't call for U-Haul to close.
[01:02:07.557 --> 01:02:12.020]  We don't call for Ford in Michigan, Lansing, Michigan to close.
[01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:15.442]  It's this idea of how dare you gun owners, but it gets worse.
[01:02:15.442 --> 01:02:15.963]  Here's another one.
[01:02:17.005 --> 01:02:20.129]  This is out of the Wall Street Journal and Atlanta Journal-Constitution both have it.
[01:02:20.129 --> 01:02:23.955]  Armed teachers become a reality in Georgia despite Parkland.
[01:02:23.955 --> 01:02:25.457]  Don't you feel for them?
[01:02:25.457 --> 01:02:32.206]  This extension, it's like when they make up stuff and take out a context of what I've said about Sandy Hook, they go...
[01:02:32.927 --> 01:02:34.808]  It's like I killed the kids at Sandy Hook.
[01:02:34.808 --> 01:02:40.531]  It's like, then Jones, how dare him, you know, question babies and incubators in Iraq, which they admit is fake.
[01:02:40.531 --> 01:02:43.772]  And it's just this holier-than-thou-ness that the media has.
[01:02:43.772 --> 01:02:48.174]  Well, let me actually tell you what these headlines really are intending to mean.
[01:02:48.174 --> 01:02:52.997]  Gun show draws crowd despite media and Democrat propaganda.
[01:02:52.997 --> 01:02:53.737]  That's what it really is.
[01:02:53.737 --> 01:02:55.338]  And by the way, we've seen record crowds.
[01:02:55.558 --> 01:03:02.006]  Yeah, we're not taking the guilt on because of these few mass shootings that are terrible but still kill less than 50 people a year.
[01:03:02.006 --> 01:03:07.013]  It's more likely to be struck by lightning twice or to be eaten by an alligator than to die in a mass shooting.
[01:03:07.013 --> 01:03:14.122]  You people wave the bloody shirt, tell us we're all guilty for it, and then flip out because we don't roll over to your Michael Bloomberg BS.
[01:03:14.759 --> 01:03:18.925]  Armed teachers become a reality in Georgia, despite the brainwashing propaganda.
[01:03:18.925 --> 01:03:24.992]  And by the way, there's counties in Georgia that are some of the most heavily armed counties in America, and also the safest counties in America.
[01:03:24.992 --> 01:03:28.136]  Kennesaw had gun bans 30-something years ago.
[01:03:28.136 --> 01:03:30.459]  They made the law, you've got to own guns.
[01:03:30.459 --> 01:03:31.801]  Crime rate went down 89% in one year.
[01:03:33.583 --> 01:03:39.028]  So they know a little bit in something about the Second Amendment in Georgia and what that means to protect themselves.
[01:03:39.028 --> 01:03:40.029]  So that's why that happens.
[01:03:40.029 --> 01:03:41.791]  But that's what this really means.
[01:03:41.791 --> 01:03:42.551]  Oh my gosh!
[01:03:42.551 --> 01:03:43.993]  The brainwashing isn't working!
[01:03:43.993 --> 01:03:45.374]  The propaganda isn't working!
[01:03:45.374 --> 01:03:47.356]  The Democrat lies aren't working!
[01:03:47.356 --> 01:03:48.897]  It's actually helping the NRA!
[01:03:49.718 --> 01:03:51.900]  I can't believe you even had a gun show!
[01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:52.800]  You murderers!
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:56.883]  It's like you killed the Parkland kids like Alex Jones said nobody died!
[01:03:56.883 --> 01:03:58.424]  But we never said that!
[01:03:58.424 --> 01:04:05.149]  They defamed you and said that you said nobody died and then edited the videos to make it sound like you said that.
[01:04:05.149 --> 01:04:07.451]  Or that you said they were crisis actors.
[01:04:07.451 --> 01:04:13.395]  No, we said they were chosen by the Democrats to go out and push the PR to be anti-gun.
[01:04:13.635 --> 01:04:15.356]  Now this is how nasty these people are.
[01:04:15.356 --> 01:04:19.960]  They understand that defamation is one of the hardest things to litigate about.
[01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:23.403]  How am I supposed to prove what damage they caused to my career?
[01:04:23.403 --> 01:04:27.706]  How many potential listeners won't listen to me or potential sponsors might not pick up my show?
[01:04:27.706 --> 01:04:31.149]  So they know that they can lie about us and that defamation litigation is almost impossible.
[01:04:31.149 --> 01:04:32.530]  So that's why they do it, Alex.
[01:04:32.530 --> 01:04:33.871]  And they're never going to stop.
[01:04:33.871 --> 01:04:34.612]  They're never going to stop.
[01:04:34.612 --> 01:04:35.112]  So you know what?
[01:04:35.112 --> 01:04:35.573]  It's fine.
[01:04:35.573 --> 01:04:36.353]  Just keep attacking us.
[01:04:36.353 --> 01:04:37.194]  Keep attacking the NRA.
[01:04:37.194 --> 01:04:38.155]  It's just going to get bigger than ever.
[01:04:39.055 --> 01:04:40.096]  Same thing.
[01:04:40.096 --> 01:04:40.957]  NRA's getting bigger.
[01:04:40.957 --> 01:04:41.838]  We're getting bigger.
[01:04:41.838 --> 01:04:42.518]  So, whatever.
[01:04:42.518 --> 01:04:45.781]  But we're not as big and powerful and old as the NRA, so we need the support, folks.
[01:04:45.781 --> 01:04:47.923]  The NRA is like turbocharging.
[01:04:47.923 --> 01:04:50.826]  Thank God we kept them honest with governors of America.
[01:04:50.826 --> 01:04:57.472]  We'll be right back with more and with the anti-gunners on abortion.
[01:04:57.472 --> 01:04:59.513]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[01:04:59.513 --> 01:05:00.154]  Go ahead.
[01:05:00.154 --> 01:05:02.336]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[01:05:02.336 --> 01:05:05.399]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[01:05:06.207 --> 01:05:07.628]  It just gets old, man.
[01:05:07.628 --> 01:05:10.050]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[01:05:10.050 --> 01:05:12.371]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[01:05:12.371 --> 01:05:16.394]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[01:05:16.394 --> 01:05:19.696]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[01:05:19.696 --> 01:05:22.378]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[01:05:22.378 --> 01:05:23.738]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[01:05:23.738 --> 01:05:24.859]  Us being shut down?
[01:05:24.859 --> 01:05:25.880]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:27.401]  You know what, Alex?
[01:05:27.401 --> 01:05:28.501]  Hey, put him on pause again!
[01:05:28.501 --> 01:05:29.601]  Hey, Frank!
[01:05:29.601 --> 01:05:35.264]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[01:05:35.264 --> 01:05:39.786]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[01:05:39.786 --> 01:05:42.907]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[01:05:42.907 --> 01:05:43.387]  You understand?
[01:05:43.387 --> 01:05:45.008]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:05:45.008 --> 01:05:46.149]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:05:47.129 --> 01:05:52.720]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:53.461]  Do you understand?
[01:05:53.461 --> 01:05:54.744]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:05:54.744 --> 01:05:56.567]  Free Press needs your help, Frank!
[01:06:00.365 --> 01:06:01.487]  News.
[01:06:01.487 --> 01:06:02.869]  Analysis.
[01:06:02.869 --> 01:06:04.190]  Reports.
[01:06:04.190 --> 01:06:06.773]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:06.773 --> 01:06:10.258]  Sweet dreams are made of this.
[01:06:10.258 --> 01:06:13.882]  Who am I to disagree?
[01:06:13.882 --> 01:06:16.946]  I travel the world and the seven seas.
[01:06:23.139 --> 01:06:32.602]  Now folks, I told you we're going to be adding more live transmissions on the weekend because that's a big hole that radio and TV stations are asking for.
[01:06:32.602 --> 01:06:36.764]  And I can tell you, we do live videos on the weekend, they get three, four times the views.
[01:06:36.764 --> 01:06:43.146]  So we're going to start live shows on the weekend, some of them are going to be taped shows as well, highly produced.
[01:06:43.766 --> 01:06:46.728]  And they're all going to be podcasted out as audio and video.
[01:06:46.728 --> 01:06:53.531]  CounterThink, meaning countering the establishment brainwashing, with Mike Adams, premiered last week.
[01:06:53.531 --> 01:06:57.934]  The second installment is going to be really powerful tonight, 6 o'clock central.
[01:06:57.934 --> 01:07:02.997]  That is in 54 minutes, or 53 minutes and 7 seconds.
[01:07:02.997 --> 01:07:06.799]  And it is going to be extremely powerful on some very important topics.
[01:07:06.799 --> 01:07:07.919]  CounterThink with Mike Adams.
[01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:14.602]  As soon as this hour is over, you'll want to go to Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:07:14.602 --> 01:07:17.923]  You'll want to go out to the YouTube streams we've got, the Facebook, Twitter streams.
[01:07:17.923 --> 01:07:23.845]  We're going to keep those going, and then we'll archive it an hour after the show's over to Infowars.com.
[01:07:24.904 --> 01:07:26.244]  And NewsWars.com.
[01:07:26.244 --> 01:07:34.986]  That's a special hour he highly produces and prepares for and tapes on Fridays that airs after our live show on Sundays.
[01:07:34.986 --> 01:07:40.287]  And we're going to be adding three-hour shows, two-hour shows, five-hour call-ins, Saturday and Sunday nights.
[01:07:40.287 --> 01:07:47.689]  We're going to be adding, by the end of the year, a lot of new broadcast for our radio stations and TV stations as we up the game against the Globals.
[01:07:47.689 --> 01:07:52.630]  That way, as things break live, we'll have the reporters, the people in, the congressmen and women.
[01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:53.530]  It's going to be amazing.
[01:07:53.530 --> 01:07:54.370]  Now, Owen Schroer.
[01:07:55.806 --> 01:08:00.968]  Putting bookends on this and just getting it, because you shot probably, I don't know, seven, eight, nine hours that I saw.
[01:08:00.968 --> 01:08:08.510]  I watched a couple hours of it, but it looked like seven, eight hours, correct me if I'm wrong, of live video Friday, Saturday at the NRA convention and outside.
[01:08:08.510 --> 01:08:12.991]  And just recap some of the craziest you saw in this particular video we're about to play.
[01:08:13.331 --> 01:08:20.096]  Well, first, I just want to say that the NRA convention was one of the most diverse crowds I've ever seen in my life.
[01:08:20.096 --> 01:08:22.638]  Nicest people that you could meet, all of them.
[01:08:22.638 --> 01:08:28.642]  You saw a bunch of people with their dogs and pets and families and from the elderly people, the young children.
[01:08:28.642 --> 01:08:31.885]  I mean, what a fun family event if you haven't been to one.
[01:08:31.885 --> 01:08:37.909]  But when I go out into the streets at the anti-NRA events, you know, that's when you get the nastiness.
[01:08:37.909 --> 01:08:40.571]  I mean, it looks like a lobotomized mutant invasion.
[01:08:40.751 --> 01:08:41.972]  And here's the other thing, too.
[01:08:41.972 --> 01:08:54.437]  When I put a microphone in front of a, if you want to label them conservative, right-winger, gun activist, whatever, at an NRA event, they all can speak coherently, they all know what they're wanting to say, and they can have a conversation with you.
[01:08:54.437 --> 01:08:55.678]  And hey, we can smile and laugh.
[01:08:56.238 --> 01:08:59.741]  The exact opposite happens when I go due to the anti-NRA event.
[01:08:59.741 --> 01:09:03.604]  So this video in particular, first of all, I could hardly get, nobody would talk to me at this event.
[01:09:03.604 --> 01:09:07.408]  They kicked me out of this park less than five minutes after I entered.
[01:09:07.408 --> 01:09:09.810]  That video is also on the Alex Jones channel on YouTube.
[01:09:09.810 --> 01:09:20.499]  And then you'll see in this video also the same pumpkin minion that was following Alyssa Milano's thug to kick that guy out illegally and intimidate him out of his free speech rights.
[01:09:20.499 --> 01:09:24.302]  He comes in in the middle of this video after this girl actually has a conversation with me.
[01:09:24.302 --> 01:09:24.943]  I'll give her credit.
[01:09:25.243 --> 01:09:26.723]  He comes down and shuts it down.
[01:09:26.723 --> 01:09:28.804]  So watch as she begins to engage with him.
[01:09:28.804 --> 01:09:36.225]  They're trying to keep the press from talking to their people because it's all a top-down hierarchical system.
[01:09:36.225 --> 01:09:38.006]  Conservatives, Libertarians will always talk to you.
[01:09:38.006 --> 01:09:42.927]  You go to any leftist event, it's like communist events, they will not talk to you and they tell folks don't talk to them.
[01:09:42.927 --> 01:09:51.829]  So you got Melissa Milano, this B-level lady, we've got what 60, 70, 80,000 people inside listening to Trump, listening to Owen Schroer, you name it.
[01:09:52.549 --> 01:10:04.112]  You come outside, like a hundred people out there, here's InfoWars, like it or hate it, or love it, you know, we've got millions of viewers and listeners every hour, and they're always trying to stop us, so here's this bizarre footage.
[01:10:04.112 --> 01:10:10.573]  Planned Parenthood that kills millions of babies a year, but you don't support the NRA, which wants to protect people.
[01:10:10.573 --> 01:10:13.174]  Planned Parenthood does not kill babies.
[01:10:13.174 --> 01:10:14.054]  Oh, they don't abort babies?
[01:10:15.888 --> 01:10:16.830]  Oh my God, they always say that.
[01:10:29.497 --> 01:10:32.458]  Then why are there so many children that aren't in homes right now?
[01:10:32.458 --> 01:10:33.538]  Why are there so many children in homes?
[01:10:33.538 --> 01:10:34.459]  So let's just tell them.
[01:10:34.459 --> 01:10:35.519]  Hit pause.
[01:10:35.519 --> 01:10:35.919]  Hit pause.
[01:10:35.919 --> 01:10:36.679]  I started over.
[01:10:36.679 --> 01:10:37.960]  I want to play this.
[01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:38.680]  Here's the deal.
[01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:40.000]  They always say this.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:40.781]  You can look at the numbers.
[01:10:40.781 --> 01:10:45.022]  There are more people wanting to adopt each year than there are abortions.
[01:10:45.022 --> 01:10:46.883]  But they make you pay hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[01:10:46.883 --> 01:10:47.843]  The government blocks it.
[01:10:48.323 --> 01:10:55.806]  Then there are a lot of drug addict and dysfunctional families that have their kids taken and then they get thrown into these even more dysfunctional situations.
[01:10:55.806 --> 01:11:01.368]  I'm not saying all social services are bad, I'm not saying all foster parents are bad, but statistically it's really bad.
[01:11:01.368 --> 01:11:02.909]  A lot of pedophilia, you name it.
[01:11:03.789 --> 01:11:04.209]  I don't know.
[01:11:19.116 --> 01:11:21.637]  Well, and of course we have the government saying men and women don't exist.
[01:11:21.637 --> 01:11:27.139]  You got a UT professor on video last week saying masculinity doesn't exist, the family doesn't exist.
[01:11:27.139 --> 01:11:28.100]  That was just a week ago.
[01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:29.000]  I can't believe this.
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.041]  It's mind control.
[01:11:30.041 --> 01:11:31.901]  These people believe they control reality.
[01:11:31.901 --> 01:11:33.162]  So back it up at the start.
[01:11:33.162 --> 01:11:35.143]  Here is this lady, one of the anti-gunners, saying...
[01:11:35.950 --> 01:11:38.052]  I would not because I support that.
[01:11:38.052 --> 01:11:42.535]  So you support Planned Parenthood that kills millions of babies a year but you don't support the NRA which wants to protect people?
[01:11:42.535 --> 01:11:43.876]  Planned Parenthood does not kill babies.
[01:11:43.876 --> 01:11:44.917]  Oh, they don't abort babies?
[01:12:02.370 --> 01:12:05.892]  They abort unwanted children because- Unwanted children?
[01:12:05.892 --> 01:12:08.513]  Oh my, children would be unwanted?
[01:12:08.513 --> 01:12:13.114]  Are you saying that you would adopt every single child that would be forced to be born?
[01:12:13.114 --> 01:12:14.955]  I'm saying someone would, yes, someone would.
[01:12:14.955 --> 01:12:17.136]  And they'd pay high dollar for it too, yes.
[01:12:17.136 --> 01:12:19.277]  Why are there so many children that aren't- Pause again.
[01:12:19.617 --> 01:12:22.199]  We've got to take all the guns and not one more child can die!
[01:12:22.199 --> 01:12:25.000]  But we've got to get rid of all these unwanted who are forced to live!
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:35.547]  And then of course you've got David Hogg, who never denied it on his Reddit file, saying, I want mosquitoes to kill billions, oh god it's so beautiful, oh my god I love David Rockefeller.
[01:12:35.547 --> 01:12:38.049]  Here, here, here, let's go back to her, here we go.
[01:12:38.049 --> 01:12:40.190]  Now why are there so many children in foster care?
[01:12:40.190 --> 01:12:46.034]  Why are there so many children in other countries that don't have homes and are living in terrible conditions that aren't being adopted?
[01:12:46.034 --> 01:12:47.795]  So your answer is to kill the children?
[01:12:49.285 --> 01:12:50.786]  Don't kill the children!
[01:13:19.205 --> 01:13:27.849]  Their baby daughter died two weeks before term and they barely they got her out just a few minutes late before she died and man she was battling to get that cord around her neck.
