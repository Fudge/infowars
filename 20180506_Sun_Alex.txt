[00:00.000 --> 00:13.480]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[00:13.480 --> 00:23.800]  front lines of the N4.
[00:23.800 --> 00:34.680]  Well Friday was a bad day for the rogue government, deep state Clinton, stay behind network, organized
[00:34.680 --> 00:41.880]  crime controller, their final last ditch fortress inside the federal government to hold their
[00:41.880 --> 00:44.800]  whole house of criminal cards together.
[00:44.800 --> 00:52.320]  Robert Fixer for the Clintons and for the Bushes and for Obama Mueller had two judges
[00:52.320 --> 00:59.940]  and we saw big coverage of the top judge in the Manafort case, the top judge in Russiagate
[00:59.940 --> 01:09.720]  in Fantasyland coming out and saying that Mueller had lied to them to get the warrants
[01:09.720 --> 01:14.600]  and then it was all fake and then he was just trying to get Trump impeached, those are quotes
[01:14.600 --> 01:19.880]  and then he had unfettered power or was attempting unfettered power, that means rogue or runaway.
[01:19.880 --> 01:26.600]  Let's get the definition of unfettered, it means unblocked, unbridled, rogue, get me
[01:26.600 --> 01:30.280]  the English Oxford if we can because I like it because it will have six or seven definitions
[01:30.280 --> 01:33.320]  below it, let's see if my memory serves right, I haven't actually looked it up and I know
[01:33.320 --> 01:39.240]  what it means, unfettered, released from restraint or inhibition, that means rogue or runaway
[01:39.240 --> 01:45.560]  and then let's scroll down, let's see some more of the definition, unbridled, rampant,
[01:45.560 --> 01:53.440]  uninhibited, unconstrained, unrestricted, unchecked, unmuffled, uncontrolled.
[01:53.440 --> 02:00.320]  Top federal judge in Russiagate calls it unrestrained, rogue, out of control and then the other top
[02:00.320 --> 02:07.520]  federal judge on the circuit court, on another circuit court handling the case of the lawsuit
[02:07.520 --> 02:13.040]  where they're suing all these Russian companies going we have proof that you mess with the
[02:13.040 --> 02:17.520]  election while the Russian companies showed up for court, so let's start discovery and
[02:17.520 --> 02:21.800]  Mueller went actually judge we might want to stop for six months or we might drop this
[02:21.800 --> 02:26.960]  entirely because it's totally made up, but that's what they do, they file lawsuits or
[02:26.960 --> 02:30.600]  they file these indictments and then try to hold it up to just hang it out there in the
[02:30.600 --> 02:40.320]  news and go Roger Stone was in contact with the Goose of her 2.0, all of the media was
[02:40.320 --> 02:45.760]  going to the message board that he frequented, you can go there at 100 CBS, NBC, ABC, everyone's
[02:45.760 --> 02:50.000]  like Goose of her, Goose of her, if you've got such big leaks talk to us and Roger one
[02:50.000 --> 02:56.480]  time is on there saying I hope you'll talk to me sometime, after the time they claim
[02:56.480 --> 03:01.240]  all the hacking went on, of course people are reaching out to Goose of her 2.0, I remember
[03:01.240 --> 03:08.720]  walking into my producers going get me Goose of her 2.0, it's like I'm saying get me Julian
[03:08.720 --> 03:13.920]  Assange, but see I'm not establishment enough to have Julian Assange on her Goose of her,
[03:13.920 --> 03:17.840]  they all want to go in the New York Times their enemy site and the New York Times had
[03:17.840 --> 03:24.960]  those people on, they had them on, but that's okay, but that's what they do on CNN breathlessly
[03:24.960 --> 03:30.440]  with David Korn this weekend in MSNBC, did you see, oh my God, Roger Stone, he's the
[03:30.440 --> 03:35.160]  main guy there after, oh my gosh, this means they've got massive proof boy, he's in a lot
[03:35.160 --> 03:41.400]  of trouble and it's all made up and now the federal judge in two of these cases talks
[03:41.400 --> 03:49.080]  about how hundreds of pages of these indictments and these lawsuits is one civil one's criminal
[03:49.080 --> 03:54.800]  are blacked out, well the judge wants to see what's un-blacked out because already on these
[03:54.800 --> 04:00.600]  cases other stuff has been un-blacked out and it's all about their agents saying there's
[04:00.600 --> 04:05.840]  no evidence, there's nothing, we've come up dry, just like Strock talking to his girlfriends
[04:05.840 --> 04:10.960]  like man I want out of this, there's nothing there and we're going to get in a lot of trouble,
[04:10.960 --> 04:15.720]  well we're meeting with Andy, he said it'll be all right, Andy McCabe the deputy director,
[04:15.720 --> 04:19.920]  so you got the capo above them for the Don, you know the Clintons above them, the Don,
[04:19.920 --> 04:25.320]  the Clinton crime machine's got the major mob chiefs under them and then you've got
[04:25.320 --> 04:30.400]  the capos beneath that, you've got Andrew McCabe and then you've got the little street
[04:30.400 --> 04:34.920]  soldiers going boss are you sure, are you sure it's going to be all right, so I mean
[04:34.920 --> 04:40.360]  we paid for the illegal dossier it's made up and there's nothing there except you boss,
[04:40.360 --> 04:45.040]  you know you and we get the Russian money all the time, it's okay right, we try to bust
[04:45.040 --> 04:49.800]  the president now that he's the president, it's actually, you know what I'm saying,
[04:49.800 --> 04:55.800]  like yes, you sure we'll get away with it, I mean we're scared, we'll poop our little
[04:55.800 --> 04:59.920]  panties, we'll be back.

[06:36.440 --> 06:41.080]  developments, the good, the bad, the ugly, it is all just crazy.
[06:41.080 --> 06:45.280]  We had Owen Schreuer and Michael Zimmerman up there Friday, Saturday and Sunday and I'm
[06:45.280 --> 06:49.840]  told he's going to be popping out at the bottom of the hour, Owen Schreuer entered the building
[06:49.840 --> 06:50.840]  and I haven't seen him.
[06:50.840 --> 06:53.440]  I'm told Owen Schreuer will be here.
[06:53.440 --> 06:59.480]  They went down to the NRA, inside now it was amazing, shot Trump's speech live, met
[06:59.480 --> 07:05.000]  a lot of patriots and then went outside of the anti-gunners and at the local city park
[07:05.000 --> 07:11.480]  they wouldn't even allow press in that was an anti-gun to politely interview the anti-gunners.
[07:11.480 --> 07:16.880]  Then other people politely just simply walk up to the tiny group of anti-gunners where
[07:16.880 --> 07:22.720]  some B actress from the 80s was there and they've got armed security guarding Melissa
[07:22.720 --> 07:28.560]  Milano, again an unknown B actress basically from thousands of years ago and these guys
[07:28.560 --> 07:34.360]  come up and say, yeah, we're armed, get out of here, want you to leave and then basically
[07:34.360 --> 07:36.360]  push them out of the park.
[07:36.360 --> 07:41.800]  The image of armed bodyguards guarding the B actress because she's a God, you though
[07:41.800 --> 07:48.200]  you don't get a right to protect yourself according to these people and they say, oh
[07:48.200 --> 07:52.280]  you're with info wars, you've been told to leave and the guy goes, I'm not with info
[07:52.280 --> 07:59.680]  wars but it's literally just these entitled arrogant and I view crazy liberals that just
[07:59.680 --> 08:06.120]  show up and by the way, I'm not just saying I just stood in my ground, pull up footage
[08:06.120 --> 08:11.720]  of Dallas Sheriff's Department attacks Alex Jones.
[08:11.720 --> 08:17.760]  I was up there, the Dallas Police Department said, yes, you can march without a permit,
[08:17.760 --> 08:23.480]  they're in the JFK 40th anniversary and then at the end of it, the whole service is over,
[08:23.480 --> 08:28.640]  where the police chief says, you can go in the park now, personally tells me that.
[08:28.640 --> 08:31.880]  We go over there and the Sheriff's Department says, no, you can't.
[08:31.880 --> 08:35.920]  So we sit there and nicely demonstrate for about 20 minutes and a couple hundred goons
[08:35.920 --> 08:41.160]  show up from the Democrat Party run Sheriff's Department, they've got a literal La Raza
[08:41.160 --> 08:45.800]  lady that runs it and they've been federalized, it turned out under Obama and they attack
[08:45.800 --> 08:47.120]  us and I stood up to them.
[08:47.120 --> 08:50.200]  I mean, you know, it was a couple hundred cops, they did Rammus and hit us and attack
[08:50.200 --> 08:54.040]  children and finally push us out with their billy clubs, but I, you know, I stood in my
[08:54.040 --> 08:55.040]  ground.
[08:55.040 --> 08:59.680]  So I'm just telling you a couple of thugs tell me to get out of the city park and tell
[08:59.680 --> 09:04.480]  me they got guns, you put your hand on me, you're going to have a big problem.
[09:04.480 --> 09:09.960]  So and I'm not knocking this guy, he probably was smarter than I'd be standing as you know,
[09:09.960 --> 09:11.440]  backing down and just showing what thugs they were.
[09:11.440 --> 09:15.160]  But you watch this footage of some of these union people and I'm guessing their Democrat
[09:15.160 --> 09:20.480]  Party union enforcers, that's what they look like, what they act like.
[09:20.480 --> 09:25.200]  And it is just crazy to see the total entitlement.
[09:25.200 --> 09:26.840]  You don't get guns.
[09:26.840 --> 09:29.280]  You don't get to have any of this.
[09:29.280 --> 09:34.520]  We have them and we're going to then tell you, you don't have a first amendment.
[09:34.520 --> 09:39.840]  So that's coming up at the bottom of the hour now.
[09:39.840 --> 09:44.200]  There are so many incredible articles I've got here, but before I hit the really big
[09:44.200 --> 09:45.600]  ones, let me just hit this first.
[09:45.600 --> 09:53.520]  You can search engine liberals are more likely to steal and less likely to get the charity.
[09:53.520 --> 09:58.400]  You'll get Harvard studies, you'll get Toronto university studies, you'll get universities
[09:58.400 --> 10:02.120]  and England studies, big studies.
[10:02.120 --> 10:12.640]  Well there's one in the associated press of all places that just came out today, shock
[10:12.640 --> 10:17.440]  study, climate skeptics, more eco-friendly than climate alarmists.
[10:17.440 --> 10:23.080]  Of course, conservatives and libertarians are better stewards of the land and actually
[10:23.080 --> 10:27.960]  recycle and do all the stuff because we tend to be more OCD.
[10:27.960 --> 10:32.560]  The left in major studies, I just pulled one up from a few years ago for TV viewers, are
[10:32.560 --> 10:39.040]  more likely to steal, what is it, six times more likely to steal, nine times more likely
[10:39.040 --> 10:44.600]  to not give the charity, but they're way more likely to tell you they're giving the charity.
[10:44.600 --> 10:49.120]  So there's one, Americans who are skeptical about climate change, well it used to be global
[10:49.120 --> 10:53.000]  freezing and warming, it's manmade, we're skeptical, we know that the climate's always
[10:53.000 --> 10:54.000]  changing.
[10:54.000 --> 10:56.360]  See how they play those games?
[10:56.360 --> 10:59.720]  Those who are skeptical about climate change engage in personal behavior that's more friendly
[10:59.720 --> 11:04.040]  to the environment than climate alarmists, who support increased government regulation
[11:04.040 --> 11:05.360]  and new studies found.
[11:05.360 --> 11:09.600]  Yeah, University of Michigan led by a team of researchers in a year-long individual study
[11:09.600 --> 11:14.680]  of 600 Americans who regularly reported their climate change beliefs and of course I want
[11:14.680 --> 11:19.440]  solar on my farmhouse because it makes sense and it costs less money in the long run and
[11:19.440 --> 11:24.880]  it's smart and it is good for the environment.
[11:24.880 --> 11:28.400]  Do I want giant windmills that have a bigger carbon footprint and kill all the birds and
[11:28.400 --> 11:31.280]  bankrupt every country they put them in?
[11:31.280 --> 11:32.280]  No.
[11:32.280 --> 11:35.160]  Is carbon dioxide the problem or is it GMO?
[11:35.160 --> 11:36.720]  Is it cross human species?
[11:36.720 --> 11:42.040]  Is it all of the geoengineering?
[11:42.040 --> 11:47.120]  There's real crises going on and we get diverted with all the fake ones, but that's a big deal.
[11:47.120 --> 11:53.800]  Now, let me just tell you what's coming up in the next segment.
[11:53.800 --> 11:55.560]  Criminality was not a good day.
[11:55.560 --> 11:59.040]  Most of the coverage was on the main federal judge over the Manafort case, who's the head
[11:59.040 --> 12:00.760]  Russiagate judge.
[12:00.760 --> 12:04.840]  One already recused themselves in the Flynn case.
[12:04.840 --> 12:07.680]  They now admit there's no evidence of criminality from Flynn.
[12:07.680 --> 12:09.640]  Why do you plead guilty?
[12:09.640 --> 12:14.760]  Because it would cost him a million dollars and he was on a general's payroll and that's
[12:14.760 --> 12:20.120]  a couple hundred thousand a year, doesn't have the money.
[12:20.120 --> 12:24.200]  Customs already spent a million, I had to spend a lot of money with all the attacks they've
[12:24.200 --> 12:29.120]  got on me, all the fake stuff, that's what they do.
[12:29.120 --> 12:33.040]  But now they're looking at dropping the charges on Flynn, not because he said anything, not
[12:33.040 --> 12:34.440]  because he told Mueller what he wanted.
[12:34.440 --> 12:36.280]  There's nothing there.
[12:36.280 --> 12:41.920]  The president was president-elect and directed his national security advisor in waiting, that's
[12:41.920 --> 12:45.360]  what you do the day you're elected, to contact the Russian ambassador.
[12:45.360 --> 12:47.720]  That's what you do.
[12:47.720 --> 12:51.120]  You never lied about it.
[12:51.120 --> 12:58.320]  But now federal judge rejects Mueller's request for delay in Russian troll farm case, saying
[12:58.320 --> 12:59.840]  it's a fraud.
[12:59.840 --> 13:04.560]  And the other big federal judge accused Mueller team of lying to target and impeach Trump.
[13:04.560 --> 13:11.200]  That's a quote for quote unfettered power.
[13:11.200 --> 13:12.200]  So that is coming up.
[13:12.200 --> 13:14.080]  I mean, this is devastating.
[13:14.080 --> 13:16.360]  These are the judges, three judges.
[13:16.360 --> 13:19.960]  The judges recused themselves on the Flynn case.
[13:19.960 --> 13:25.760]  Now the judge on this new Democrat lawsuit against the Russians and Trump and Stone says
[13:25.760 --> 13:27.840]  this is complete BS.
[13:27.840 --> 13:36.080]  And so Mueller's talking about dropping it or simply asking for a stay, a long stay till
[13:36.080 --> 13:37.560]  after the election.
[13:37.560 --> 13:41.640]  I mean, you talk about pulling your horns in, you talk about wanting it to go away.
[13:41.640 --> 13:49.880]  I mean, they indict 12 or 13 John Doe's and then just say, because Mueller filed a lawsuit,
[13:49.880 --> 13:53.240]  the Democrats filed a lawsuit, that it's proof.
[13:53.240 --> 13:56.280]  And you know why Mueller's in trouble?
[13:56.280 --> 14:00.200]  He lied and said they weren't targeting Trump's lawyer.
[14:00.200 --> 14:04.120]  And all over the news, him and Comey testified to Congress that nobody ever targeted anybody
[14:04.120 --> 14:07.640]  in the Trump circle during the campaign when he was president-elect or president.
[14:07.640 --> 14:12.120]  And now we all know they've admitted last week they were spying on Trump for two years
[14:12.120 --> 14:13.120]  before the election.
[14:13.120 --> 14:17.440]  And they were spying on his lawyer and Trump towered everything we told you.
[14:17.440 --> 14:21.000]  And they lied to get the warrants on Trump Tower about something completely different.
[14:21.000 --> 14:25.640]  The judge hasn't said what it is, but he blew up, it says, in the hearing and screamed at
[14:25.640 --> 14:29.840]  Mueller and said, you lied to get these warrants.
[14:29.840 --> 14:31.320]  You're a liar.
[14:31.320 --> 14:35.880]  You want to impeach Trump.
[14:35.880 --> 14:40.200]  And then said, I've seen the unredacted pages.
[14:40.200 --> 14:43.160]  You're not not releasing this to financial security.
[14:43.160 --> 14:45.680]  You're doing it because it shows there's no case.
[14:45.680 --> 14:47.200]  Your own agents told you that.
[14:47.200 --> 14:49.000]  And this is in the news.
[14:49.000 --> 14:52.400]  And what did Strock say once president was elected in office?
[14:52.400 --> 14:55.560]  He said to his girlfriend, there were the underlings running the whole fake Russian
[14:55.560 --> 14:56.560]  gate.
[14:56.560 --> 14:58.440]  He said, we got to stop this.
[14:58.440 --> 14:59.600]  We can't do this.
[14:59.600 --> 15:02.080]  We're going to get in trouble.
[15:02.080 --> 15:04.760]  There's nothing there.
[15:04.760 --> 15:16.120]  Let's see, oh, arrogant Brennan and arrogant clapper and all McCabe and all the other people
[15:16.120 --> 15:20.440]  above them, Comey and Mueller.
[15:20.440 --> 15:26.120]  They're all arrogant and in power for decades, done whatever they want illegally spied, covered
[15:26.120 --> 15:31.320]  up murders, covered up real Russian gate, covered up uranium one, covered up nuclear
[15:31.320 --> 15:35.640]  reactors, covered up Iran deals, payoffs, covered up all of it.
[15:35.640 --> 15:38.520]  And now, wow, they're not able to go with whatever they want.
[15:38.520 --> 15:43.200]  And they're just freaking out and crapping their britches in front of everyone and the
[15:43.200 --> 15:50.000]  stink can be smelled all the way here in Texas from the swamp and all you neocons and limpristic
[15:50.000 --> 15:54.000]  conservatives that signed on to all this like Len Beck, aren't you fools now?
[15:54.000 --> 15:58.400]  You cowardly on American scum bags.
[15:58.400 --> 16:02.320]  I was just about to walk out of the studio to pick my children up and I got some bad
[16:02.320 --> 16:03.320]  news.
[16:03.320 --> 16:07.400]  For the second time in the five and a half year history of survival shield X2, our flagship
[16:07.400 --> 16:10.840]  product, we are having supply chain problems.
[16:10.840 --> 16:12.720]  And this may be the last batch of this.
[16:12.720 --> 16:18.320]  We have deep earth crystal source that's so pure that it actually turns into purple gas
[16:18.320 --> 16:19.360]  in the atmosphere.
[16:19.360 --> 16:24.360]  And so in our own search to get the purest form, we discovered that oil companies and
[16:24.360 --> 16:28.840]  gas drilling companies had a byproduct that they were selling to pharmaceutical companies
[16:28.840 --> 16:31.000]  and also drug makers that they used to make drugs.
[16:31.000 --> 16:35.840]  And once they figure out there's a market, they start jacking up the price.
[16:35.840 --> 16:39.440]  But we're offering it still 25% off until it sells out.
[16:39.440 --> 16:42.800]  Hopefully, just like the last time this happened a few years ago, it's not an issue and we
[16:42.800 --> 16:43.800]  do get more.
[16:43.800 --> 16:49.200]  But right now, we are not able to secure the crystals that produce the purest iodine in
[16:49.200 --> 16:50.200]  the world.
[16:50.200 --> 16:54.760]  Because it's for Stamina, libido, focus, energy is really amazing.

[20:02.720 --> 20:17.440]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:17.440 --> 20:26.120]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance,
[20:26.120 --> 20:33.320]  rallying Patriots worldwide.
[20:33.320 --> 20:37.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:37.400 --> 20:41.480]  You know when the mainstream corporate lion media tells you somebody's really, really
[20:41.480 --> 20:46.360]  good, you know they're really, really bad and I've been on there 23 years.
[20:46.360 --> 20:54.400]  I remember Robert Mueller before he was the director of the FBI was a true monster.
[20:54.400 --> 20:58.800]  Through the whole Richard Jewel case, three different people who they tried to charge
[20:58.800 --> 21:03.160]  for the Olympic Park bombing, who they knew were totally innocent and Mueller was their
[21:03.160 --> 21:05.600]  haunt showing charging three innocent people.
[21:05.600 --> 21:09.960]  Now he finally got a fourth guy, took them to a governmental institution.
[21:09.960 --> 21:14.240]  They filled him full of pills and he died in the first few hours in custody.
[21:14.240 --> 21:17.200]  So they got their fourth guy on the Olympic Park bombing.
[21:17.200 --> 21:25.120]  But then they moved on from there and blamed some other Christian quote extremist as they
[21:25.120 --> 21:26.120]  said.
[21:26.120 --> 21:30.480]  So five different people Mueller said did that.
[21:30.480 --> 21:32.040]  It just goes on and on.
[21:32.040 --> 21:39.000]  The guys famous for covering up for the Clintons and Bush and Obama just unbelievable uranium
[21:39.000 --> 21:44.280]  being delivered in Moscow on tarmacs at midnight in the sleep in duffel bags.
[21:44.280 --> 21:49.600]  I mean, if Trump was doing that, I'd say hang them up by his toenails politically, but there's
[21:49.600 --> 21:52.360]  nothing there but pure Americana.
[21:52.360 --> 21:53.840]  There's nothing there but delivering.
[21:53.840 --> 21:57.440]  We're going to get to that next segment.
[21:57.440 --> 22:00.760]  So here's the Associated Press headline.
[22:00.760 --> 22:02.520]  Here's the Fox News headline.
[22:02.520 --> 22:03.520]  Here's the Reuters headline.
[22:03.520 --> 22:10.000]  Even the CNN headline says federal judge blast Mueller's team.
[22:10.000 --> 22:13.040]  Well, what they blast them for.
[22:13.040 --> 22:18.560]  Federal judge, this is Friday, accuses Mueller's team of lying, trying to target Trump.
[22:18.560 --> 22:19.920]  Come on, man.
[22:19.920 --> 22:21.440]  You just want to impeach him.
[22:21.440 --> 22:22.440]  That's the quote.
[22:22.440 --> 22:31.160]  And the judge went on to say US Judge T.S. Ellis, the third, said you don't really care
[22:31.160 --> 22:33.040]  about Manafort.
[22:33.040 --> 22:37.200]  You really care about what information Mr. Fanafort can give you to lead Mr. Trump and
[22:37.200 --> 22:38.200]  impeachment or whatever.
[22:38.200 --> 22:45.720]  And he goes on to say you lied to get your warrants and then goes into how there's no
[22:45.720 --> 22:53.960]  Russia gain information and how he wants the memos redacted and the FBI reports because
[22:53.960 --> 22:58.160]  the judge is able to read them as a classification, even above the FBI at that level, and says
[22:58.160 --> 23:02.760]  I want you to declassify this right now or I'm going to do it because it doesn't say
[23:02.760 --> 23:04.680]  there's Russia evidence.
[23:04.680 --> 23:08.960]  It says you're covering it up and your own agents were saying they didn't like what was
[23:08.960 --> 23:09.960]  going on.
[23:09.960 --> 23:14.480]  Imagine being up the agents, even of your Democrats being ordered to make stuff up at
[23:14.480 --> 23:17.840]  the president elect because that's when they started getting scared.
[23:17.840 --> 23:23.680]  And that's why Clapper and Brennan went on TV and said, Trump will be out of office within
[23:23.680 --> 23:25.120]  weeks of being in.
[23:25.120 --> 23:26.120]  We're going to remove him.
[23:26.120 --> 23:27.120]  Don't worry.
[23:27.120 --> 23:28.120]  Everybody stay behind.
[23:28.120 --> 23:29.120]  Nobody leave.
[23:29.120 --> 23:31.760]  Don't follow his orders.
[23:31.760 --> 23:34.840]  That is in the Hill today again.
[23:34.840 --> 23:38.160]  I told you back at the time this was going on.
[23:38.160 --> 23:45.120]  Hayden says don't follow orders from the president and he says do not work for the government
[23:45.120 --> 23:46.120]  under Trump.
[23:46.120 --> 23:48.280]  That's the Hill today.
[23:48.280 --> 23:50.680]  That's coming up, but that makes my point.
[23:50.680 --> 23:55.400]  Federal judge goes on to say you are unfettered.
[23:55.400 --> 24:00.760]  The Hill translates that to federal judge says Mueller is above the law or believes he is.
[24:00.760 --> 24:02.560]  Now let me tell you what unfettered means.
[24:02.560 --> 24:07.400]  What have I called Mueller for a year and a half since Rosenstein put him in day one?
[24:07.400 --> 24:11.000]  This rogue group in the executive branch that the president had no power over, even though
[24:11.000 --> 24:12.440]  he has total power over it.
[24:12.440 --> 24:13.440]  That's rogue.
[24:13.440 --> 24:15.000]  They're rogue.
[24:15.000 --> 24:17.000]  They're runaway.
[24:17.000 --> 24:18.360]  They're stay behind networks.
[24:18.360 --> 24:19.760]  These are legal terms.
[24:19.760 --> 24:22.880]  Well, what does unfettered mean in law?
[24:22.880 --> 24:28.240]  Look at Black's law, not just English or Oxford.
[24:28.240 --> 24:29.240]  Look at Black's.
[24:29.240 --> 24:30.840]  That'll be a legal definition.
[24:30.840 --> 24:31.840]  I know what it's going to say.
[24:31.840 --> 24:33.120]  It's going to say rogue.
[24:33.120 --> 24:35.640]  Now, listen to this.
[24:35.640 --> 24:40.440]  That's a term in law, rogue agent, rogue government.
[24:40.440 --> 24:44.960]  Unfettered, the judge said.
[24:44.960 --> 24:53.920]  It means unrestrained, unrestricted, unconstrained, uninhibited, rampant, unbridled, free from
[24:53.920 --> 24:54.920]  law.
[24:54.920 --> 24:59.080]  That's what it means.
[24:59.080 --> 25:01.440]  Mueller is his own branch of government.
[25:01.440 --> 25:10.200]  A few months ago, six months ago, I called him Emperor Mueller and Slate and Salon and
[25:10.200 --> 25:14.960]  Raw Story and Newsweek, all had headlines saying, Jones is insane.
[25:14.960 --> 25:18.200]  Search engine and click web to show people.
[25:18.200 --> 25:22.160]  Alex Jones thinks Mueller's an emperor or thinks he's a king.
[25:22.160 --> 25:25.120]  It's like Alex Jones and they're like crazy articles.
[25:25.120 --> 25:29.320]  Jones has gone crazy, he believes Mueller's an actual royalty.
[25:29.320 --> 25:30.640]  No jerks.
[25:30.640 --> 25:36.800]  He thinks he's a king, fourth branch of government outside of executive, judicial and legislative.
[25:36.800 --> 25:38.200]  They've announced that they're separate.
[25:38.200 --> 25:43.400]  Just like the Federal Reserve has announced on C-SPAN before and on NPR and on PBS.
[25:43.400 --> 25:45.240]  I've got all the clips.
[25:45.240 --> 25:49.480]  Alan Greenspan famously, as he left, said, we are a fourth branch of government separate
[25:49.480 --> 25:53.560]  from the other three and no one can constrain us, not even the people.
[25:53.560 --> 25:55.680]  It's crazy talk.
[25:55.680 --> 25:57.360]  The three branches constrain each other.
[25:57.360 --> 25:59.520]  A fourth would be a king.
[25:59.520 --> 26:01.880]  There it is.
[26:01.880 --> 26:02.880]  Media matters.
[26:02.880 --> 26:03.880]  That's George Soros' mouth.
[26:03.880 --> 26:04.880]  Alex Jones.
[26:04.880 --> 26:08.680]  There's a plot to install Robert Mueller as the first king of America.
[26:08.680 --> 26:11.280]  The quote is the first king of America.
[26:11.280 --> 26:17.440]  Yeah, I said he'd be a rogue element able to do it every once and would basically set
[26:17.440 --> 26:21.720]  up the police, the federal police, like a third world country or what happened in Rome
[26:21.720 --> 26:27.040]  as a new rogue, runaway, controlled element.
[26:27.040 --> 26:31.000]  Word for word, what I said has now been said by the federal judge.
[26:31.000 --> 26:32.000]  Tomorrow's news today.
[26:32.000 --> 26:38.720]  Now, it's not hard to know that, but we've got another federal judge over the Russian
[26:38.720 --> 26:44.760]  lawsuit where they suing Stone, Trump, everybody saying they're Russian agents and the judge
[26:44.760 --> 26:49.000]  said, okay, here's the companies that you said did this.
[26:49.000 --> 26:50.000]  They're here.
[26:50.000 --> 26:51.000]  They want all the evidence.
[26:51.000 --> 26:52.760]  Mueller said, oh, we want to punt for six months.
[26:52.760 --> 26:53.960]  We may drop it.
[26:53.960 --> 27:00.840]  It was all just about filing that and saying everybody's Russian agents.
[27:00.840 --> 27:03.960]  So now the judge has called him out.
[27:03.960 --> 27:06.680]  On that, that's Politico.
[27:06.680 --> 27:13.040]  Judge rejects Mueller's request for delay in Russian troll farm case.
[27:13.040 --> 27:17.280]  Mueller probe might have to go dark until the midterm elections because of this Wall
[27:17.280 --> 27:18.280]  Street Journal.
[27:18.280 --> 27:19.280]  They're panicking.
[27:19.280 --> 27:20.280]  They're pulling back.
[27:20.280 --> 27:22.920]  They're hoping you forget all these embarrassments.
[27:22.920 --> 27:29.120]  Remember, they were going to be done by December, but all the memos about Andy McCabe and Strock
[27:29.120 --> 27:35.160]  and his girlfriend and the Piscate dossier, the steel dossier and paying their wives millions
[27:35.160 --> 27:41.880]  of dollars infusion GPS to create the fake dossier and the Justice Department's wives
[27:41.880 --> 27:44.960]  getting money and McCabe getting a half million from Hillary.
[27:44.960 --> 27:47.440]  That was embarrassing six months ago.
[27:47.440 --> 27:51.240]  So they just kind of took Mueller out of the news and went into Stormy Daniels and women
[27:51.240 --> 27:52.880]  for four or five months.
[27:52.880 --> 27:56.240]  And now they're going back into Mueller and think you don't remember that.
[27:56.240 --> 27:59.240]  And now because the judges have said it's all a giant fraud to impeach the president
[27:59.240 --> 28:02.040]  with no evidence and that the judges have all the documents that are secret, but they
[28:02.040 --> 28:06.520]  want the FBI to release them or Congress will, they'll go back to the memos or something
[28:06.520 --> 28:08.520]  else and they are that he's senile.
[28:08.520 --> 28:11.520]  And then as soon as they think you've forgotten about that, they'll be right back with we're
[28:11.520 --> 28:16.200]  all Russian agents because we love America and want to see the country great.
[28:16.200 --> 28:19.960]  And just cut the Russian fuel supply off and are devastating them and massing troops on
[28:19.960 --> 28:20.960]  their border.
[28:20.960 --> 28:23.800]  And yeah, yeah, Trump's really with the Russians, give me a frickin break.
[28:23.800 --> 28:28.440]  The globalists are with all these foreign powers selling nation states out and they don't know
[28:28.440 --> 28:29.440]  what to do.
[28:29.440 --> 28:30.440]  They're panicking.
[28:30.440 --> 28:35.480]  But Alan Dershowitz is right, Giuliani, I got to say, man, he's just he's given Trump
[28:35.480 --> 28:36.480]  bad advice.
[28:36.480 --> 28:37.480]  This is weird.
[28:37.480 --> 28:39.800]  And Dershowitz says Trump team playing into Mueller's hands.
[28:39.800 --> 28:45.320]  The president needs Alan Dershowitz, he's a real lawyer, he's a Democrat, he's perfect
[28:45.320 --> 28:48.280]  and he's got a track record of being accurate.
[28:48.280 --> 28:49.780]  Trump needs Alan Dershowitz.
[28:49.780 --> 28:50.780]  Good Lord.
[28:50.780 --> 28:52.280]  And he needs to start moving.

[30:59.760 --> 31:05.000]  Infowarslife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[31:05.000 --> 31:10.200]  We have found an extraordinary, new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[31:10.200 --> 31:17.040]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[31:17.040 --> 31:22.920]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[31:22.920 --> 31:26.240]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[31:26.240 --> 31:31.160]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit
[31:31.160 --> 31:36.200]  of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[31:36.200 --> 31:37.680]  symptoms.
[31:37.680 --> 31:42.680]  Pollen block is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine, in fact, current research
[31:42.680 --> 31:47.480]  has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme
[31:47.480 --> 31:51.600]  that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[31:51.600 --> 31:54.320]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[31:54.320 --> 31:59.280]  Visit infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[31:59.280 --> 32:03.360]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also
[32:03.360 --> 32:08.480]  enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[32:08.480 --> 32:12.520]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[32:12.520 --> 32:16.880]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[32:16.880 --> 32:22.200]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[32:22.200 --> 32:28.600]  Remember and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% organic coffee at infowarslife.com.
[32:28.600 --> 32:33.720]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn
[32:33.720 --> 32:35.680]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[32:35.680 --> 32:40.120]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections
[32:40.120 --> 32:42.880]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[32:42.880 --> 32:47.200]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two and I don't think you're going to be disappointed,
[32:47.200 --> 32:50.640]  available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[32:50.640 --> 32:55.440]  You'll be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup
[32:55.440 --> 33:02.800]  of my favorite coffee available at infowarslife.com.
[33:02.800 --> 33:16.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:16.800 --> 33:23.280]  Trashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[33:23.280 --> 33:26.800]  front lines of the info war.
[33:26.800 --> 33:30.040]  Look, here's the bottom line.
[33:30.040 --> 33:34.880]  Jeff Sessions did a great job in the Senate exposing gun control and open borders plans
[33:34.880 --> 33:39.600]  by George W. Bush three or four times and I thought he was a great attorney general.
[33:39.600 --> 33:44.480]  But since then, he has been involved in massive classical dereliction of duty.
[33:44.480 --> 33:50.080]  He has openly in so many ways protected this whole rogue group, Rosenstein that set up
[33:50.080 --> 33:53.560]  this new power structure and tricked the president to signing it.
[33:53.560 --> 33:54.560]  He can always negate that.
[33:54.560 --> 33:56.400]  It's his branch of government.
[33:56.400 --> 33:59.960]  And now you've got Mueller with all these federal judges over Russia Gates saying, you're
[33:59.960 --> 34:00.960]  lied.
[34:00.960 --> 34:01.960]  We caught you.
[34:01.960 --> 34:02.960]  We have the documents.
[34:02.960 --> 34:07.080]  You are unfettered, meaning rogue government trying to overthrow the president.
[34:07.080 --> 34:10.120]  Just like Nunes says, he's going for contempt charges this week.
[34:10.120 --> 34:13.080]  That's holding him in contempt, the attorney general.
[34:13.080 --> 34:15.920]  For what he's doing and it's all coming out.
[34:15.920 --> 34:19.960]  So when I say locked sessions up, if it comes out, sessions knows about all this and knew
[34:19.960 --> 34:22.320]  about all this and didn't do anything.
[34:22.320 --> 34:28.880]  He is just as guilty as Strock and Rosenstein and McCabe and Mueller and Comey and all of
[34:28.880 --> 34:29.880]  them.
[34:29.880 --> 34:32.560]  And it's outrageous and it is dangerous.
[34:32.560 --> 34:34.080]  So that's what this comes down to.
[34:34.080 --> 34:35.360]  But the wheels are coming off.
[34:35.360 --> 34:39.480]  That's why Mueller is set to announce AP's reporting that he may go dormant until the
[34:39.480 --> 34:40.840]  midterms are over.
[34:40.840 --> 34:44.320]  Not because they don't want to unsettle an election, but because they want you to forget
[34:44.320 --> 34:47.160]  about the devastating information that just came out.
[34:47.160 --> 34:52.280]  Now, we're going to cut that little live piece and put it on the front of the last segment
[34:52.280 --> 34:54.360]  when we put that out because it needs to go viral.
[34:54.360 --> 34:58.400]  Oh, and shroyers here just got back from the NRA did a great job of the right to shotgun
[34:58.400 --> 35:04.280]  with me in the next hour when we're set to have Michael Schneider in a very close race.
[35:04.280 --> 35:05.280]  And I mean, I'm having him.
[35:05.280 --> 35:10.440]  I don't usually focus on one race, but he's neck and neck in Idaho.
[35:10.440 --> 35:11.520]  In the primary.
[35:11.520 --> 35:14.520]  And there's the Democrats always lose by 25, 30 points.
[35:14.520 --> 35:17.160]  So he basically this is the congressional election.
[35:17.160 --> 35:19.320]  He's against the never Trump and neocon.
[35:19.320 --> 35:23.960]  So this it's not just Democrats were trying to beat it's it's never Trumpers and neocons.
[35:23.960 --> 35:25.600]  So that's coming up in studio.
[35:25.600 --> 35:30.760]  But but oh, and the rest of this segment, the situation here with Mueller.
[35:30.760 --> 35:35.480]  I mean, this is completely rogue, as I've always said, that if you know law, this is
[35:35.480 --> 35:37.040]  completely criminal.
[35:37.040 --> 35:40.600]  President CNN admits that he quote gets rough with people and does whatever he wants.
[35:40.600 --> 35:41.760]  He totally violates the law.
[35:41.760 --> 35:43.280]  They lie to federal judges.
[35:43.280 --> 35:45.120]  He's up to his eyeballs with the Russians.
[35:45.120 --> 35:51.000]  He's fighting for his life as a Russian agent on Russian boards with Russian uranium transfers.
[35:51.000 --> 35:55.760]  Mueller needs to get his ass swat teamed clapper, Brennan, all these arrogant people, Hayden's
[35:55.760 --> 36:00.440]  back in the news, former head of the CIA, threatening people saying you better not work
[36:00.440 --> 36:02.480]  for Trump in the government or we'll get you.
[36:02.480 --> 36:06.920]  Well, that's what they're doing behind the scenes is is blocking with rogue government
[36:06.920 --> 36:09.040]  and it's getting to the point now.
[36:09.040 --> 36:12.480]  These guys work for a foreign power, the globalist and their ally with the Communist
[36:12.480 --> 36:13.960]  Chinese and Davos.
[36:13.960 --> 36:14.960]  I'm serious.
[36:14.960 --> 36:18.400]  It's getting to the point where if they try to remove the president, man, he's got every
[36:18.400 --> 36:20.160]  right and the duty.
[36:20.160 --> 36:23.200]  It's getting in a dereliction of duty area for the Trump for Trump.
[36:23.200 --> 36:27.840]  If we don't start moving on these people because they're moving on us extra judicially, they're
[36:27.840 --> 36:31.400]  the globalist and you got to fight fire with fire.
[36:31.400 --> 36:35.680]  Well, over the weekend, I was calling Robert Mueller, the deep state president because he
[36:35.680 --> 36:39.080]  kind of seemed to be the one in charge of the deep state propping it up.
[36:39.080 --> 36:44.240]  But now, as things are developing to the close of this weekend, and we move forward to next
[36:44.240 --> 36:47.160]  week when I think you're going to hear more from Devin Nunes, more from these intelligence
[36:47.160 --> 36:50.480]  communities, more from even federal judges, perhaps.
[36:50.480 --> 36:54.040]  Now I'm starting to wonder, was Robert Mueller the Tokyo Rose of the globalist?
[36:54.040 --> 36:57.040]  Was Robert Mueller the Tokyo Rose of the deep state?
[36:57.040 --> 36:59.680]  Here he is, the Russian investigation.
[36:59.680 --> 37:03.800]  Like Trump, it really is like, so he props this false narrative up the media and all
[37:03.800 --> 37:07.120]  the- And in a modern sense, that'd be Baghdad, Bob.
[37:07.120 --> 37:10.480]  Okay, so yeah, but it's basically like you use all the media outlets to act like the
[37:10.480 --> 37:12.520]  Mueller investigation is real.
[37:12.520 --> 37:14.320]  That's what you got from Operation Mockingbird.
[37:14.320 --> 37:17.920]  That got exposed from all the JFK files that Trump released.
[37:17.920 --> 37:21.840]  And then you have Mueller doing this fake investigation that they act as real.
[37:21.840 --> 37:22.800]  He's totally rogue.
[37:22.800 --> 37:25.800]  Like you said, nobody's buying it anymore.
[37:25.800 --> 37:30.320]  Any leftist or liberal with half-wit understands that the Mueller investigation is fake and
[37:30.320 --> 37:31.880]  there is no Russian collusion.
[37:31.880 --> 37:37.160]  It's just the radical fringe elements of anyone, whether you want to say leftists, Americans,
[37:37.160 --> 37:39.440]  or anyone around the world that believes this crap.
[37:39.440 --> 37:41.560]  So it's like, what comes next?
[37:41.560 --> 37:43.280]  Who actually brings Mueller down?
[37:43.280 --> 37:45.720]  Who actually brings Mueller and this investigation to an end?
[37:45.720 --> 37:49.440]  And notice, as soon as the wheels came off, they totally switched to Stormy Daniels, rated
[37:49.440 --> 37:53.840]  his lawyer, which we now know was directed by Mueller with illegal wiretaps because they
[37:53.840 --> 37:56.400]  now admit it was not the scope of Russiagate.
[37:56.400 --> 38:00.760]  And they lied to the judges to get it on that lawyer and knew it wasn't there.
[38:00.760 --> 38:01.920]  And it's all coming out.
[38:01.920 --> 38:04.040]  And what does this have to do with anything?
[38:04.040 --> 38:05.840]  What does this have to do with an election?
[38:05.840 --> 38:07.840]  What does this have to do with Russian collusion?
[38:07.840 --> 38:11.720]  And it changes the subject from, yeah, about what's in the WikiLeaks.
[38:11.720 --> 38:17.400]  Total crime, illegal servers, pay-per-play, hundreds of millions laundered.
[38:17.400 --> 38:18.880]  It's incredible.
[38:18.880 --> 38:21.320]  And they will tell you not to read that on CNN.
[38:21.320 --> 38:23.240]  Well, you don't have the right to read that.
[38:23.240 --> 38:24.560]  We do here at CNN.
[38:24.560 --> 38:25.560]  We the two-year rule.
[38:25.560 --> 38:28.640]  Let's change the subject to all these people that have the economy roaring, building up
[38:28.640 --> 38:33.240]  our military, defending our border, crushing political correctness, getting us out of the
[38:33.240 --> 38:35.400]  TPP, renegotiating NAPT and GATT.
[38:35.400 --> 38:37.000]  They're the Russians.
[38:37.000 --> 38:38.000]  Yeah, right.
[38:38.000 --> 38:41.040]  You're the globalists that's had your foot on our neck forever, and we've got it off
[38:41.040 --> 38:43.800]  our neck, and we're bleeding, but we're getting up, and you're scared.
[38:43.800 --> 38:46.920]  You better be scared because we're about to kick your ass politically.
[38:46.920 --> 38:51.280]  If this isn't the Twilight Zone, if this isn't 1984 in the flesh, I don't know.
[38:51.280 --> 38:52.400]  I don't know what could be.
[38:52.400 --> 38:56.000]  I really don't know what could be.
[38:56.000 --> 38:57.160]  There's nothing here.
[38:57.160 --> 38:58.160]  Think about this, Alex.
[38:58.160 --> 39:02.480]  They come down on Trump for obstruction of justice, which is, oh, now Mueller's looking
[39:02.480 --> 39:05.920]  at obstruction of justice, the latest out of the Tokyo roses.
[39:05.920 --> 39:08.000]  Well, what is obstructing of justice?
[39:08.000 --> 39:09.000]  What is the justice?
[39:09.000 --> 39:12.640]  Russian collusion isn't even a crime, and if you're saying there was any proof of Russian
[39:12.640 --> 39:14.160]  collusion, that it would be half the case.
[39:14.160 --> 39:15.400]  That's why they always call it collusion.
[39:15.400 --> 39:18.680]  It's like saying, well, you didn't cheat on your wife, but once you shook hands with
[39:18.680 --> 39:22.960]  a lady and kind of laughed and giggled at her and winked at her at the water cooler,
[39:22.960 --> 39:26.200]  you're like, okay, I did wink at Betty Lou.
[39:26.200 --> 39:28.120]  She is hot, but I didn't cheat on my wife.
[39:28.120 --> 39:30.600]  It's not illegal.
[39:30.600 --> 39:33.120]  And there wasn't even winking at the Russians going on.
[39:33.120 --> 39:37.720]  But meanwhile, Mueller and Hillary, if you want to use a sexual analogy, they had the
[39:37.720 --> 39:42.640]  Russians' legs up behind the Russians' ears, and there was a gang rape going on to get
[39:42.640 --> 39:44.480]  that Russian money to then rape America.
[39:44.480 --> 39:48.440]  I mean, there was a line out the door if you want to use a sexual allegory.
[39:48.440 --> 39:51.080]  So why won't they turn over their servers?
[39:51.080 --> 39:52.480]  You want to talk about obstruction of justice?
[39:52.480 --> 39:56.400]  Well, why don't you prove it was Russia that so-called hacked the DNC, which you can't
[39:56.400 --> 39:57.400]  even prove?
[39:57.400 --> 39:59.960]  So, they obstruct justice.
[39:59.960 --> 40:01.480]  They collude with Russia.
[40:01.480 --> 40:06.400]  They lose the election, throws the entire thing into a spiral panic, and then somehow
[40:06.400 --> 40:10.480]  they still have their elements of the deep state remaining put Mueller up, sessions hands
[40:10.480 --> 40:14.320]  are tied, he recuses himself, Trump says, I'm gonna stay away from the Attorney General's
[40:14.320 --> 40:16.400]  office and the Justice Department, I'll let them work that out.
[40:16.400 --> 40:19.000]  I don't want to have any bad press about me doing this.
[40:19.000 --> 40:23.240]  And so it's all this fake thing hanging over our heads, and still Trump is doing everything
[40:23.240 --> 40:26.440]  he can to fulfill his promises and make America great, like he said.
[40:26.440 --> 40:30.680]  And it's perfect for these globalist traders that have sold to stop the Chinese, the Russians,
[40:30.680 --> 40:33.920]  you name it, to then point at all us that are actually bringing the country back and
[40:33.920 --> 40:36.440]  say, look, they're the enemies, they're the problem.
[40:36.440 --> 40:37.440]  It's incredible.
[40:37.440 --> 40:43.280]  Well, and that's the problem too, where they tell me, I go out and they'll say, hey, you're
[40:43.280 --> 40:44.960]  causing a divide.
[40:44.960 --> 40:46.120]  You're dividing this country.
[40:46.120 --> 40:47.120]  You're fake news.
[40:47.120 --> 40:48.720]  And I'm like, wait a second, hold up.
[40:48.720 --> 40:54.480]  How about a fake investigation that has a bunch of the population worrying that Russia is
[40:54.480 --> 40:56.840]  behind the election of Trump?
[40:56.840 --> 41:00.000]  I had a high level Democrat that I ran into on the street when I was downtown, Friday
[41:00.000 --> 41:01.000]  taking care of business.
[41:01.000 --> 41:05.200]  Go, Alex, I like your show, but, you know, but I tell you, the president, Trump's bringing
[41:05.200 --> 41:06.520]  ill repute on the presidency.
[41:06.520 --> 41:07.520]  He's embarrassing it.
[41:07.520 --> 41:09.600]  They never brought up Bill Clinton's sex stuff.
[41:09.600 --> 41:10.600]  They covered up rapes.
[41:10.600 --> 41:11.880]  Trump's not doing anything illegal.
[41:11.880 --> 41:15.840]  They covered up all the stuff that, oh, because the media is demonizing the presidency.
[41:15.840 --> 41:18.320]  So we finally have a president being the president.
[41:18.320 --> 41:22.280]  Then the Democrats act like he's the one bringing ill repute on it.
[41:22.280 --> 41:24.560]  It's incredibly how stupid these people are.
[41:24.560 --> 41:28.640]  But this is the least trusted the television media has ever been.
[41:28.640 --> 41:29.640]  Even the person that would believe that.
[41:29.640 --> 41:30.640]  And then they blame Trump for that.
[41:30.640 --> 41:32.160]  They go, you're going to get journalists killed.
[41:32.160 --> 41:36.000]  No, you're lying and being globalist traders is why people hate you.
[41:36.000 --> 41:37.840]  Take responsibility for it.
[41:37.840 --> 41:44.920]  Well, I think the worst this gets in some silver lining sense, the better it gets.
[41:44.920 --> 41:48.440]  Because more people, I think, are understanding how ridiculous Mueller is.
[41:48.440 --> 41:51.400]  A lot of these people really expected there to be something.
[41:51.400 --> 41:58.120]  They really had Mueller as this idol, this God of justice of saving America from Trump.
[41:58.120 --> 41:59.840]  And he really has fallen now.
[41:59.840 --> 42:03.920]  So what are they going to do as it's a nothing burger, except he committed all these crimes
[42:03.920 --> 42:05.680]  and did wiretap and lied about it?
[42:05.680 --> 42:07.920]  What are they going to do as their God descends in flames?
[42:07.920 --> 42:11.280]  Well, I think that there's two options that we know probably are on the table.
[42:11.280 --> 42:15.040]  One is we've seen it in the emails where they talk about, we've got our guys ready.
[42:15.040 --> 42:18.920]  If they fire Mueller, if they fire Roderstein, we'll riot on the streets, Democrats sending
[42:18.920 --> 42:19.920]  out emails.
[42:19.920 --> 42:24.320]  And then you have to say, okay, on the larger scale, on the real globalist controlled deep
[42:24.320 --> 42:27.360]  state scale, do they launch some sort of false flag?
[42:27.360 --> 42:29.640]  You know, I mean, who knows what they could do?
[42:29.640 --> 42:33.480]  Cyber false flag, bio false flag, a typical false flag.
[42:33.480 --> 42:34.960]  Oh yeah, they're going to pull something big.
[42:34.960 --> 42:37.080]  We're going to talk more about that coming up.
[42:37.080 --> 42:38.760]  Because they're not going to give up.
[42:38.760 --> 42:42.400]  Look at the arrogance of the deep state, the Congress, the president, the voters trying
[42:42.400 --> 42:43.600]  to overthrow our election.
[42:43.600 --> 42:48.840]  This is a coup against America, a coup against our electoral process, where they say, no,
[42:48.840 --> 42:51.320]  you didn't really vote for Trump, the Russians did it.
[42:51.320 --> 42:52.920]  What a load of baloney.

[43:58.280 --> 44:02.200]  I was just about to walk out of the studio to pick my children up and I got some bad
[44:02.200 --> 44:03.200]  news.
[44:03.200 --> 44:07.320]  For the second time in the five and a half year history of survival shield x2, our flagship
[44:07.320 --> 44:12.640]  product, we are having supply chain problems and this may be the last batch of this.
[44:12.640 --> 44:17.360]  We have deep earth crystal source that's so pure that it actually turns into purple
[44:17.360 --> 44:23.360]  gas in the atmosphere and so in our own search to get the purest form, we discovered that
[44:23.360 --> 44:28.040]  oil companies and gas drilling companies had a byproduct that they were selling to pharmaceutical
[44:28.040 --> 44:32.000]  companies and also drug makers that they used to make drugs and once they figure out there's
[44:32.000 --> 44:35.760]  a market, they start jacking up the price.
[44:35.760 --> 44:40.480]  But we're offering it still 25% off until it sells out, hopefully just like the last
[44:40.480 --> 44:43.960]  time that's happened a few years ago, it's not an issue and we do get more, but right
[44:43.960 --> 44:49.480]  now we are not able to secure the crystals that produce the purest iodine in the world.
[44:49.480 --> 44:54.600]  But what it does is for Stamina, libido, focus, energy is really amazing.

[49:12.200 --> 49:13.920]  you're watching or listening to.
[49:13.920 --> 49:18.360]  Please support the local station by spreading the word about it, your local business, become
[49:18.360 --> 49:20.120]  a sponsor on it.
[49:20.120 --> 49:25.360]  I can't tell you separately on local TV and local cable how many businesses I see restaurants
[49:25.360 --> 49:29.360]  you name it that are incredibly successful.
[49:29.360 --> 49:34.880]  And I remember 15 years ago, 16 years ago when I was number one on the city of Austin
[49:34.880 --> 49:41.120]  on FM affiliate that now is music and they asked me how my show in just a few years went
[49:41.120 --> 49:45.880]  to number one when the station had no ratings in the paper and I said well I did a lot of
[49:45.880 --> 49:52.880]  promotion you know the show was hard hitting but I said also I ran TV ads by the tens
[49:52.880 --> 49:58.640]  of thousands on local cable and I remember I had a buddy worked at Time Warner and I
[49:58.640 --> 50:04.400]  was asking he had accounts there as a salesman he also did engineering and I said how much
[50:04.400 --> 50:08.040]  is an ad say during the discovery channel he said well if you buy a big package they're
[50:08.040 --> 50:13.400]  $2 apiece at prime time and I'm like discovery channel has huge viewers and he goes I know
[50:13.400 --> 50:21.080]  I ran ads I ran advertising for my show on local cable so I'm just saying local cable
[50:21.080 --> 50:27.200]  local TV is one of the best places to advertise just like radio but cable people just ignore
[50:27.200 --> 50:31.400]  that there's local ads on it it's just waiting it's like you just go do these huge buys by
[50:31.400 --> 50:33.160]  that a lot of it's just computerized.
[50:33.160 --> 50:39.160]  I ran ads the years ago on Fox but you got to buy the remnants is what they're called
[50:39.160 --> 50:42.920]  overnight and then Politico has gotten involved and blocked me doing it that was through Google
[50:42.920 --> 50:45.840]  that's why I made me so mad a couple years ago on Google blocked me from advertising
[50:45.840 --> 50:50.280]  you could go and computerize to Google have your ad it's approved just that it's standards
[50:50.280 --> 50:54.640]  and quality and then it runs on national cable see I'm digressing here in the inside baseball
[50:54.640 --> 50:58.600]  I'm sorry it's just having the time to jack with all this it's just please support our
[50:58.600 --> 51:02.720]  local affiliates okay let's shift gears now I'm going to get more into this next hour
[51:02.720 --> 51:06.280]  more into the whole Mueller thing and how Rosie of Donald's been caught committing more crimes
[51:06.280 --> 51:11.760]  and elections way beyond Anastasia's so-called crime but will she go to jail no because Republicans
[51:11.760 --> 51:16.360]  let Democrats run wild they let him persecute Christians they let him persecute everybody
[51:16.360 --> 51:24.680]  also next hour Amazon bars Christians from Amazon that's mainstream news I mean oh yeah
[51:24.680 --> 51:30.000]  just like Google and Apple are taking Christian holidays off their calendars and Google won't
[51:30.000 --> 51:33.960]  do doodles for holidays that are Christian but they'll do them for Muslims I mean they're
[51:33.960 --> 51:38.920]  out to get us I want shroyer well it is kind of shocking when you see that but this video
[51:38.920 --> 51:45.320]  that we're about to play is a perfect example of the double standard and the double think
[51:45.320 --> 51:48.880]  if you want to use the 1984 terminology of what we're dealing with with people on the
[51:48.880 --> 51:53.680]  street now I want to say this I want to clarify something I think you'll agree with this these
[51:53.680 --> 51:59.000]  street protesters and the vermin that come out and do these protests are the fringe
[51:59.000 --> 52:04.840]  elements and they really give true liberals a bad name there are people out there that
[52:04.840 --> 52:08.480]  that watch us that just have different views that land on the left side of things but they're
[52:08.480 --> 52:13.320]  not crazy they're not fringe and these people really kind of drown their those voices out
[52:13.320 --> 52:19.120]  and make them look but we're not just selectively cherry picking them you go any Democrat event
[52:19.120 --> 52:22.560]  more and more more and more I'd say half of them are like day of the day and that's one
[52:22.560 --> 52:26.240]  thing that they will deny that I say no you don't understand I don't edit this stuff we
[52:26.240 --> 52:30.120]  don't have to edit this stuff I can go live for an hour or two hours at one of these events
[52:30.120 --> 52:34.000]  and it's the same thing every time they curse at you they spit on you they swing on you
[52:34.000 --> 52:37.600]  they call the police and get you thrown out of the public park line they box you they
[52:37.600 --> 52:40.640]  literally you know they put their button I don't know it's just weird stuff that they
[52:40.640 --> 52:45.240]  always hit you from down low yeah it's honestly it's like absurd even think about this but
[52:45.240 --> 52:49.840]  this is what they do but here's the example now I will say that I was about 10 minutes
[52:49.840 --> 52:54.760]  late because I was rallying group of people I had about 50 people I was there with a like
[52:54.760 --> 52:59.480]  about 10 people and I went to this other NRA event where there was like a group meet and
[52:59.480 --> 53:03.440]  I brought about 50 to 100 people over to the park and we were gonna bullhorn Alyssa Milano
[53:03.440 --> 53:08.440]  speech unfortunately we missed it by 10 minutes otherwise we would have been right there bullhorring
[53:08.440 --> 53:13.880]  when that video went viral and there was another video of her using our men yeah to have people
[53:13.880 --> 53:19.280]  thrown off even though it's a park and security can't do that but again she gets armed people
[53:19.280 --> 53:23.200]  but she doesn't want you to have guns yeah and they had me kicked out to Dallas police
[53:23.200 --> 53:26.680]  came over and kicked me out and you know the Dallas police were actually really nice they
[53:26.680 --> 53:29.720]  were like look you know we know what you're doing out here we'll try to help you but hey
[53:29.720 --> 53:33.040]  you gotta go but yeah this guy you could tell this is a totally different event they hire
[53:33.040 --> 53:37.280]  this guy to be a thug intimidate people out there and brag about us but that's a violation
[53:37.280 --> 53:43.560]  of law to say yeah I'm armed now move go go go and then they say to him you're with info
[53:43.560 --> 53:47.880]  wars aren't you if you listen to the audio the guy goes no I'm not so so again they just
[53:47.880 --> 53:51.320]  totally here let's go ahead and roll and then there's that guy too oh don't even started

[55:06.080 --> 55:09.800]  I would say if it was this guy I would not have probably backed down because he's not
[55:09.800 --> 55:14.160]  law enforcement he can't just intimidate me in a public space now when Dallas police comes
[55:14.160 --> 55:18.920]  over to me and politely says look hey we got I get that but but I'm talking about this
[55:18.920 --> 55:22.640]  guy no this guy that's what I'm saying this guy is totally out there just some this is

[55:42.680 --> 56:01.880]  him talk about a pumpkin head no listen goblins have rights to go ahead and hit play and then
[56:01.880 --> 56:06.560]  more people join in to push the poor guy out of there I just you know this is totally illegal
[56:06.560 --> 56:11.600]  this is what that guy did is illegal you cannot you cannot I forget what the code is I can
[56:11.600 --> 56:15.960]  go pull it up I read no it's in the articles about it I mean they're in his space saying
[56:15.960 --> 56:19.840]  leave leave leave a park you had to call the cops you you're intimidating someone with
[56:19.840 --> 56:23.480]  a firearm you cannot do that in a public square when they're simply executing the rights free

[57:15.360 --> 57:19.440]  you you're with him for as he goes no I'm not I think I I think that what's happening here
[57:19.440 --> 57:23.760]  is the guy that eventually forces him out was probably the head of security and they
[57:23.760 --> 57:26.800]  had a code letter people around the scene and he saw that one of them or two of them
[57:26.800 --> 57:30.680]  had firearms so he said hey why do you guys have firearms you're out here against the
[57:30.680 --> 57:33.960]  NRA against firearms why do you have firearms and that's when the head of security says
[57:33.960 --> 57:38.160]  all right I'm taking control of this situation you've got to get out I got a gun and I'm
[57:38.160 --> 57:40.360]  going to intimidate you out of your rights free speech and I'm going to break the law

[01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:14.040]  world if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance you're listening to
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:19.200]  alex jones show me and i want to run over each other which is good banner because we're
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:24.520]  both so upset to to go to the r.a. convention go outside they're like 50 people out hearing
[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:30.400]  or maybe more how big was the crowd i'd say at peak probably maybe about 100 120 okay
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:36.040]  so you go up you're trying to get there but before you can somebody else is there he says
[01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:39.360]  hey are you armed guards for her as you look like security they say you need to leave yeah
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:44.720]  yeah we're armed you need to leave you need to leave right now pushing him though getting
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:49.320]  in his space which which is a violation of texas code i've seen in news articles about
[01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:57.120]  it it's well known so the image here of armed men protecting an anti gunner and then violating
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:01.080]  somebody's free speech in my view this is just too rich they think they're better than
[01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:05.320]  us they think they live by different rules than us no it's it's ridiculous it's like
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:09.600]  the other video that we can play later where i'm talking to a girl and they virtue signal
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:13.440]  about the children that are lost during mass shootings which i understand that's horrible
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:18.240]  that's awful that's gut wrenching nobody wants that but they use that to prop up their anti
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:22.360]  gun agenda and so they'll say well we need to protect children from the next school shooting
[01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:25.680]  you know children are so precious children of their future say okay well i agree with
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:29.880]  that so let's stop abortion well how dare you abortion good these are unwanted children
[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:34.920]  you're like what how can you say there's unwanted children and then say that you know every
[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:38.960]  child is the future one minute later so like you said i mean i just laughed at it at this
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:43.400]  point when you when listening to it and hearing it it's just like these people are so ridiculous
[01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:46.560]  and it gets worse than that we're gonna play the bizarre abortion statement when we come
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:51.680]  back just the time we have left in this segment son sentinel gun show draws crowds families
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:55.880]  despite parkland shooting outcry so because it's near the parkland shooting they're like
[01:01:55.880 --> 01:02:00.960]  how dare you have a gun show cancel it as if they're all murderers and as if they're all
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:05.640]  guilty well if somebody runs over somebody with a forward f-150 or a rental truck we
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:11.280]  don't call for you hall to close we don't call for ford in michigan uh lands in michigan
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:17.080]  to close it's this idea of how dare you gun owners but it gets worse here's another one
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:19.960]  this is out of the wall street journal in the land of journal constitution both have it
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:24.720]  armed teachers become a reality in georgia despite parkland how do you don't you feel
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:29.320]  for them this extension it's like when they make up stuff and take out a context of what
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:34.880]  i've said about about sandy hook they go it's like i killed the kids at sandy hook it's
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:39.800]  like then jones out dare him you know question babies and incubators in iraq which they admit
[01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:44.640]  is fake and it's just this holier than thouness that the media asks well let me actually tell
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:50.760]  you what these headlines really are intending to mean gun show draws crowd despite media
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:56.000]  and democrat propaganda that's what it really by the way we've seen record crowds yeah we're
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:00.200]  not taking the guilt on because of these few mass shootings that are terrible but are still
[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:04.680]  kill less than 50 people a year it's more likely to be struck by lightning twice or to be eaten
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:09.040]  by an alligator than to die on a mass shooting when you people wave the bloody shirt tell
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:13.040]  us we're all guilty for it and then flip out because we don't roll over to your michael
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:18.840]  bloomberg bs armed teachers become a reality in georgia despite the brainwashing propaganda
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:21.760]  and by the way there's counties in georgia that are some of the most heavily armed counties
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:27.240]  in america and also the safest counties in america so give us all had gun bans 30 something
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:33.160]  years ago they made the law you've got to own guns crime rate whip it down 89 one year
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:37.280]  so so they know a little bit of it in something about the second amendment in georgia and
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:41.080]  what that means to protect themselves so that's why that happens but that's what this really
[01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:46.360]  means oh my gosh the brainwashing isn't working the propaganda isn't working the democrat lies
[01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:51.680]  aren't working it's actually helping the nr a i can't believe you even had a gun show
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:56.960]  you murderers it's like you killed the parkland kids like elix jones said nobody died but
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:02.200]  we never said that they defamed you and said that you said nobody died and then edited
[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:06.960]  the videos to make it sound like you said that there or that you said they were crisis
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:12.640]  actors no we said they were chosen by the democrats to go out and push the pr to be
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:17.440]  anti-gun now this is how nasty these people are they understand that defamation is one
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:22.200]  of the hardest things to to litigate about how am i supposed to prove what damage they
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:26.480]  caused in my career how many potential listeners won't listen to me or potential sponsors might
[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:30.200]  not pick up my show so they know that they can lie about us and the defamation litigation
[01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:33.920]  is almost impossible so that's why they do it alex and they're never going to stop they're
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:37.040]  never going to stop so you know what it's fine just keep attacking us keep attacking the nr
[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:41.760]  a it's just going to get bigger than ever nr a is getting bigger we're getting bigger
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:45.480]  so whatever but we're not as big and powerful and old as the nr a so we need to support
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:50.800]  folks the nr a is like turbo charging thank god we kept him honest with governors of america

[01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:02.720]  don't know seven eight nine hours that i saw a wash couple hours but it looked like seven
[01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:07.600]  eight hours correct me if i'm wrong of live video friday saturday at the nr a convention
[01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:12.720]  and outside and just recap some of the craziness you saw in this particular video we're about
[01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:17.840]  to play well first i just want to say that the nr a convention was one of the most diverse
[01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:23.080]  crowds i've ever seen in my life nicest people that you could meet all of them you saw a bunch
[01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:28.240]  of people with their dogs and pets and families and and from the elderly people the young
[01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:33.320]  children i mean what a fun family event if you haven't been one but when i go out into
[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:37.800]  the streets at the entire anti nr a events you know that's when you get the nastiness
[01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:41.720]  i mean it looks like a lobotomized mutant invasion and here's the other thing to when
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:45.760]  i when i put a microphone in front of a if you want to label them conservative right
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:50.720]  winger you know gun actress whatever at an nr a event they all can speak coherently they
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:54.760]  all know what they're wanting to say and they can have a conversation with you and a we
[01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:59.960]  can smile and laugh the exact opposite happens when i go due to the anti nr a event so this
[01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:03.560]  video in particular first of all i could hardly get nobody would talk to me at this event
[01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:07.760]  they kicked me out of this park uh less than five minutes after i entered that video is
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:11.720]  also on the alex jones channel on youtube and then you'll see in this video also the

[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:25.800]  after this girl actually has a conversation with me i'll give her credit he comes down
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:31.320]  and shuts it down so so watch as she begins to engage they're trying to keep the press
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:35.520]  from talking to their people because it's all a top down high-key arc you'll system

[01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:42.840]  it's like communist events they will not talk to you and they tell folks don't talk to them
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:47.080]  so you know melissa molano this is this you know this is this b-level lady we got what
[01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:51.480]  60 70 80 000 people inside listen to trump listen to all you know oh and shroyer you

[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:06.680]  always trying to stop us so here's this bizarre footage parenthood that kills millions of
[01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:11.120]  babies a year but you don't support the n r a which wants to protect people plan parenthood
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:17.920]  does not kill babies oh they don't abort babies they abort unwanted children because unwanted
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:22.960]  children all my children would be unwanted are you saying that you would adopt every
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:27.440]  single child that would be forced to be born i'm saying someone would yes someone would
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:31.680]  and they'd pay high dollar for it too yes then why are there so many children that aren't
[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:35.120]  in homes right now why are there so many children so let's just kill them why are there so many
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:39.920]  plus it plus i started over i want to play this here's the deal they always say this
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:43.840]  you can look at the numbers there are more people wanting to adopt each year than there
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:47.920]  are abortions but they make you pay hundreds of thousands of dollars the government blocks
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:52.040]  it then there are a lot of drug addict and dysfunctional families that have their kids
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:56.440]  taken and then they get thrown into these even more dysfunctional situations not saying
[01:10:56.440 --> 01:11:00.720]  all social services are bad i'm not saying all foster parents are bad but statistically
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:05.520]  it's really bad a lot of pedophilia you name it especially in poor areas that gets out
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:09.320]  of control so the state doesn't want people doing this they don't want them and there
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:13.200]  are plenty of white folks you name it they want to adopt kids of every color the point
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:18.320]  is though that she's just like last week plant parenthood said a heartbeat does not signify
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:21.920]  life well and of course we have the government saying men and women don't exist you got a
[01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:27.280]  u t professor on video last week saying masculinity doesn't exist the family doesn't exist it was
[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:31.200]  just a week ago i can't believe this it's it's mind control these people believe they control
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:35.040]  reality so back it up at the start here is this lady one of the anti gunners saying
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:41.440]  babies are not children they are babies are not alive and the babies are not being killed
[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:45.760]  no one's been killed by plant parenthood so so they will not face the reality
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:49.280]  they're unwanted children they're not people they're children so let's go ahead and roll
[01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:53.600]  this here it is i would not because i support that so you support plant parenthood that kills
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:58.080]  millions of babies a year but you don't support the n r a which wants to protect people plant
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:04.480]  parenthood does not kill babies oh they don't abort babies they abort unwanted children
[01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:10.160]  because unwanted children oh my children would be unwanted are you saying that you would adopt
[01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:14.800]  every single child that would be forced to be born i'm saying someone would be born someone would
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:19.520]  and they pay high dollar for it too yes why are there so many children that are depositing in
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:23.600]  we've got to take all the guns not one more child can die but we gotta get rid of all these unwanted
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:27.520]  of them who are forced to live and then of course you gotta force them you've got david hawk never
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:33.440]  denied it on his on his reddit file saying i want mosquitoes to kill billions oh god it's so beautiful
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:38.400]  oh my god i love david roger feller here here let's go back to her here we go now why are there
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:43.040]  so many children in foster care why are there so many children in other countries that don't have
[01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:47.360]  homes that are living in terrible conditions that aren't being adopted so your answer is to kill the
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:54.240]  children don't kill the children but just chop them up pieces hey back it up and back it up back
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:58.640]  it up five seconds tell them and get a fly yeah don't kill them just chop their asses up or spray
[01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:02.400]  acid on them and they flop around for about 30 minutes fight their lives and little babies will
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:06.960]  fight the scalpel like i mean there's nothing there's there's there's footage of this because
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:10.880]  they've done like this and like the babies like battling they fight for their lives but some of
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:13.840]  them for some of them are fighting they don't want to be born didn't you know that some of them
[01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:17.200]  they're being they feel they're i don't want to tell this whole story but rob do he said i could
[01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:22.480]  tell it his brother's a friend of mine their baby daughter died two weeks for term and they barely
[01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:27.200]  they got her out just a few minutes late before she died and man she was battling to get that core
[01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:39.440]  wrap the cord got around her neck she was
