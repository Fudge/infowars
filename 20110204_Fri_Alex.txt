[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.160 --> 00:27.880]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones we're live my friends thank you
[00:27.880 --> 00:34.240]  for joining us it is Friday the 4th day of February 2011 we're gonna be here live for at
[00:34.240 --> 00:40.360]  least the next three hours obviously we're gonna continue to look at nationwide rolling
[00:40.360 --> 00:50.520]  blackouts blackouts natural gas outages people freezing inside of their homes we've seen many
[00:50.520 --> 00:55.160]  of the cases of poor people in the last few years in places like Michigan and New York and of
[00:55.160 --> 01:02.160]  course Illinois and Chicago having their power turned off because they're bankrupt and then
[01:02.160 --> 01:08.520]  being found frozen to death inside of their homes and this is a very serious situation that we're
[01:08.520 --> 01:16.240]  facing right now Austin Texas was blanketed in two inches of snow that's blanketed for folks in
[01:16.240 --> 01:21.120]  central Texas who don't see snow but every few years and normally very light and normally my
[01:21.120 --> 01:25.760]  20-minute drive into work took about an hour today driving 30 miles an hour the main danger was
[01:25.760 --> 01:30.240]  dodging people who don't know how to drive in the snow not that I'm an expert at it but I grew up
[01:30.240 --> 01:34.640]  in Dallas where it snowed multiple times a year so a little bit more accustomed to it than all
[01:34.640 --> 01:39.400]  the Californians that have moved to Austin and the central and south Texans that aren't accustomed
[01:39.400 --> 01:45.040]  to it it was like playing the video game Frogger driving in dodging cars sliding off into the
[01:45.040 --> 01:52.520]  ditch jumping mediums slamming on their brakes going down hills running into each other it was
[01:52.520 --> 01:59.360]  quite an adventure coming into work today and I want to hail my great producer staff I got a
[01:59.360 --> 02:02.760]  call from Matt Ryan about seven this morning he said you want us to come in and I said well
[02:02.760 --> 02:07.680]  that's up to you call everybody and if we don't get you know two people that want to come in
[02:07.680 --> 02:15.000]  during blizzard 2011 all part of the global warming Al Gore says we will just remote control
[02:15.000 --> 02:23.240]  a rebroadcast something we can do from one of my IT guys home offices but we are all here in
[02:23.240 --> 02:29.360]  fact all three of the IT guys are here they all showed up and I've got Jaron Nyhart and Matt Ryan
[02:29.360 --> 02:37.600]  here with us because again when you live in a city where you normally well my mom was a kid it
[02:37.600 --> 02:42.840]  snowed a lot but then we went through a different sun cycle and it stopped snowing in the last 35
[02:42.840 --> 02:48.840]  years or so it rarely snows in Austin so it is pandemonium bedlam but thank goodness the sun
[02:48.840 --> 02:56.240]  came out a lot of the ice and snow is melting so the wrecks are you know only in the hundreds
[02:56.240 --> 03:01.000]  an hour now not the thousands I mean it was just driving into work I probably saw 60 crashed
[03:01.000 --> 03:08.200]  vehicles they were just crashed everywhere run off the road it was crazy and it made me think
[03:08.200 --> 03:13.400]  about just how dependent we are on the infrastructure that the government controls and how
[03:13.400 --> 03:19.800]  they're systematically trying to shut off our infrastructure and how a few days ago when they
[03:19.800 --> 03:23.800]  cut the power off in Austin there weren't any working lights in many areas traffic lights
[03:23.800 --> 03:29.200]  there were no police out directing traffic today I did see some police out directing traffic not
[03:29.200 --> 03:34.640]  out there when the street lights are out radar gunning people who are supposedly speeding
[03:34.640 --> 03:38.960]  five miles over the speed limit instead of directing traffic I did actually see police
[03:38.960 --> 03:46.520]  directing traffic today which is their main job is public safety not just revenue generation so
[03:46.520 --> 03:52.520]  I saw sheriff's deputies Travis County and I saw Austin police as well directing traffic so good
[03:52.520 --> 03:59.080]  you're actually doing your job and that is a big help because there was some traffic lights out
[03:59.080 --> 04:04.240]  and people also getting stuck and wrecking into each other and pile ups and it was good to see
[04:04.240 --> 04:09.440]  the police out there actually engaging in public service and not festuting themselves and paramilitary
[04:09.440 --> 04:14.400]  regalia out there oppressing the population enough about Austin Texas that's just on the top of my
[04:14.400 --> 04:20.040]  mind so I'm discussing it obviously huge developments in the whole Egypt situation and what the
[04:20.040 --> 04:24.480]  ramifications mean for the rest of the world not just the Middle East North Africa and what it
[04:24.480 --> 04:29.440]  means about our so-called government that they're trying to put the Muslim brotherhood in who are
[04:29.440 --> 04:36.720]  openly calling for war with Israel I mean that isn't your strategy of tension your strategy of
[04:36.720 --> 04:42.480]  order out of chaos I don't know what is drudge reports top link to my report that I wrote with
[04:42.480 --> 04:49.160]  Paul Watson yesterday Obama's blocking of new power plants triggers nationwide blackouts the
[04:49.160 --> 04:55.640]  Republicans are driving the move to reinstate the Patriot Act very treacherous on that front UK
[04:55.640 --> 05:02.680]  seeks global accord on cyber behavior as a global treaty on controlling the web hundreds of nations

[07:14.640 --> 07:20.440]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[07:20.440 --> 07:25.320]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[07:25.320 --> 07:30.680]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[07:30.680 --> 07:35.080]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related

[08:24.520 --> 08:35.160]  we have several guests joining us later in the broadcast we've got a very interesting fellow who
[08:35.160 --> 08:42.360]  has a Genesis radio show on Sundays he is a pharmacist who for years saw the dangerous
[08:42.360 --> 08:49.800]  drug interactions caused by big pharma instructing doctors to put people on so many different forms
[08:49.800 --> 08:55.400]  of medication that interact with each other there are hundreds of thousands of deaths a year
[08:55.400 --> 09:00.280]  caused by this and we're going to be talking to Genesis talk show host coming up for about 45
[09:00.280 --> 09:07.560]  minutes of the second hour today a pharmacist Ben Fuchs will be joining us host of the Brightside
[09:07.560 --> 09:13.880]  program Sunday afternoons on the Genesis network and then of course we always have our once a week
[09:13.880 --> 09:19.880]  visit on the economy and all things New World Order with the one the only Bob Chapman in the last
[09:19.880 --> 09:25.240]  hour we're going to have open phones throughout the broadcast I want to get your view on the
[09:25.240 --> 09:31.480]  Egypt situation what you think's really happening there our government now admits our supposed
[09:31.480 --> 09:35.960]  government that they are backing the Muslim Brotherhood and you know me I'm not somebody who
[09:35.960 --> 09:42.680]  just gets up here and bashes Muslims all day I don't have Islamophobia I understand that the
[09:42.680 --> 09:48.040]  globalists want to have a clash of civilization with those countries and regions and that they
[09:48.040 --> 09:53.240]  have been putting dictators into place but I do know that there are such a thing as quote Muslim
[09:53.240 --> 09:59.640]  extremists who do want to establish a global Islamic rule and I'm against that just like there are
[09:59.640 --> 10:06.200]  communist Chinese who run China who want a global system run by the communist Chinese I'm not against
[10:06.200 --> 10:13.960]  the Chinese people but I am against the Communist Party China and there is no doubt the Muslim
[10:13.960 --> 10:19.720]  Brotherhood is where some of bin Laden came from there is no doubt that it is a British Intel
[10:19.720 --> 10:27.800]  operation and their own words in AP Reuters TV interviews the heads of the Muslim Brotherhood
[10:27.800 --> 10:36.680]  in Saudi Arabia in Jordan in Yemen in Egypt all over the Middle East North Africa are calling
[10:37.480 --> 10:41.080]  for the overthrow of those governments and the establishment of Islamic law
[10:42.040 --> 10:47.480]  similar to Iran and they're calling for breaking their peace treaty with Israel now I'm not a
[10:47.480 --> 10:53.720]  fan of a lot of things that Israel does and I'm critical but at the same time I don't support
[10:53.720 --> 11:00.840]  people that are trying to declare war on another country I don't want World War three I want stability
[11:02.040 --> 11:08.040]  I don't think war is cool and I don't think Hosni Mubarak is cool either a horrible dictator
[11:08.040 --> 11:12.600]  we've been very critical of with his torture camps he's been the darling of the globalist
[11:12.600 --> 11:17.000]  and if you want to know who runs our government look at how they prefer dictators to free countries
[11:17.000 --> 11:23.160]  that'll follow their orders look at how they've supported Hosni Mubarak as the number one country
[11:23.160 --> 11:28.440]  where the where the secret torture camps are that are admitted now the black sites the ghost sites
[11:28.440 --> 11:34.760]  so I'm very freaked out by this I mean I know the globalist put Mubarak in 30 years ago I know that
[11:34.760 --> 11:39.880]  they turn on dictators they put in but he'd done everything he was told and the fact that they would
[11:39.880 --> 11:45.400]  overthrow him which they're really pushing to do right now and again the people have legitimate
[11:45.400 --> 11:52.360]  reasons to be upset half the population's paid two dollars a day or less they're having their food
[11:52.360 --> 11:57.400]  rations cut via IMF and World Bank policies installed in the last year and here come the
[11:57.400 --> 12:03.880]  globalist funding alberidae and the muslim brotherhood and others to use the crisis they've helped
[12:03.880 --> 12:11.640]  create to overthrow Hosni Mubarak and put in a new system this is very very serious and
[12:13.080 --> 12:18.760]  I'm just stunned by it quite frankly I mean I I understand the multi-level chess that the
[12:18.760 --> 12:24.200]  new world order social engineers are engaged in but still to actually see it unfold it's just
[12:24.200 --> 12:29.720]  amazing so we're going to be going over the latest on that issue also an incredible report
[12:29.720 --> 12:33.560]  that we knew was coming and it integrates them with what's happening in Europe in the united
[12:33.560 --> 12:40.680]  states and in China UK seeks global accord on cyber behavior that means a global accord
[12:40.680 --> 12:45.640]  cyber rules you don't criticize your government you don't make people angry same thing we've
[12:45.640 --> 12:49.720]  been hearing from the democrats you don't criticize government or you're going to cause
[12:49.720 --> 12:55.400]  another Tucson shooting it's this attack on free speech and they're now pushing that through via
[12:55.400 --> 13:02.120]  internet too we're going to be breaking that down as well but the first thing I want to direct you
[13:02.120 --> 13:08.040]  towards if you'd like to follow along with us is the drudge report dot com and we of course have
[13:08.040 --> 13:13.560]  all these same articles posted up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com but they're
[13:13.560 --> 13:18.600]  they're kind of smattered out there if you want to get a full spectrum analysis of what's going
[13:18.600 --> 13:26.440]  on the best place right now is the top of drudge report dot com new mexico declares state of emergency
[13:26.440 --> 13:36.840]  over natural gas shortage second headline texas residents asked to limit use third headline outage
[13:36.840 --> 13:44.200]  in arizona of natural gas to major cities like Tucson another headline san diego shortage
[13:45.800 --> 13:54.120]  usage at record high in utah california utility told to cut pipeline pressures
[13:55.560 --> 14:00.840]  shell oil postpones drilling and arctic democratic senator blames whitehouse
[14:00.840 --> 14:08.440]  Mexico cancels offer to send electricity to the united states because they're running out because
[14:08.440 --> 14:16.120]  the cold weather obama's blocking of new plants triggers nationwide blackouts that's the bottom
[14:16.120 --> 14:23.960]  link there at the top links at the top of drudge and you can link through to our prison planet
[14:23.960 --> 14:28.840]  dot com article that is excellent that paul watson and i put together yesterday but i had a lot of
[14:28.840 --> 14:33.400]  notes i sent watson i wanted to add to the story that he got busy and didn't add he just has where
[14:33.400 --> 14:41.080]  the epa is trying to shut down texas power plants blocking new ones opening but i also sent watson
[14:41.080 --> 14:45.960]  links where they're shutting them down in georgia that are already built south dakota scores of
[14:45.960 --> 14:53.400]  plants in kansas the governor's order here in a half ago links to power plants being shut down
[14:53.400 --> 14:58.040]  all over the united states those are being added right now to that article so that you can see the
[14:58.040 --> 15:02.200]  clear evidence and of course there's the video clip of obama saying you go ahead and build a cold
[15:02.200 --> 15:08.040]  powered plant we're going to put taxes on you so high that you're going to go bankrupt now people
[15:08.040 --> 15:12.120]  say oh he's doing that to save us from carbon dioxide well if you believe carbon dioxide's
[15:12.120 --> 15:17.080]  causing global warming and killing the earth uh why then do the globalists push to not have any
[15:17.080 --> 15:23.640]  sanctions on mexico china india and again 160 plus other third world countries uh who are building
[15:23.640 --> 15:28.920]  cold powered plants as fast as they can that don't have the clean scrubbers that the united states
[15:28.920 --> 15:36.200]  uses well then you read deeper and you learn that obama has given the biggest builder of cold
[15:36.200 --> 15:42.040]  powered plants in the world general electric and that's the new head of his economic councils the
[15:42.040 --> 15:48.360]  former ceo of general electric a complete waiver to do whatever they want so other plants that are
[15:48.360 --> 15:57.320]  finished or almost complete 3.2 billion enough to supply 2 million people a day with power
[15:58.520 --> 16:06.680]  a 3 plus billion dollar mega clean burning cold plant in corpus christi energy city
[16:09.800 --> 16:15.560]  down there on our coast to supply south texas growing south texas and they're talking about
[16:15.560 --> 16:19.960]  blocking it in the houston chronicle and the feds are in there currently blocking the thing being
[16:19.960 --> 16:26.280]  fired up that is economic warfare that is siege against our country and those aren't just words
[16:26.280 --> 16:31.960]  i'm not just using those words to be shocking that's what this is in fact i can't figure out words
[16:32.680 --> 16:37.080]  to describe how incredible this is and and how it's not getting more attention
[16:38.920 --> 16:43.080]  but you know i didn't say yesterday on air boy i hope drudge links to our obama
[16:43.080 --> 16:48.680]  a blocking off plants triggers nationwide blackouts but i basically said a little prayer
[16:50.600 --> 16:56.360]  that it would end up there you know why because drudge sets the news agenda it's one of the few
[16:56.360 --> 17:01.000]  places where every time he covers something it breaks out into the mainstream and becomes a
[17:01.000 --> 17:07.320]  major issue he took our reportage on tsa posted it four months ago three months ago got it driving
[17:07.320 --> 17:14.280]  and now we've got a chance of defeating it and it's not that i even want the attention for
[17:14.280 --> 17:19.960]  prison planet dot com and the millions of additional clicks we'll get just off that one link it's that
[17:19.960 --> 17:26.200]  i genuinely don't like being a slave i'm genuinely angry i genuinely woke up at three in the morning
[17:26.200 --> 17:31.800]  and saw it snowing outside and was walking around the house drinking water getting angry about austin
[17:31.800 --> 17:37.720]  texas last year passing three plus billion dollars i don't remember the headline from austin energy
[17:37.720 --> 17:44.680]  i think it was 3.6 ap ran it so did news radio 590 k lbj the press released by austin energy will you
[17:47.400 --> 17:52.440]  headline austin energy to increase prices by 3.6 billion in the next three years point is
[17:53.240 --> 18:01.480]  if the un can't get the congress to put into place the kiyoto protocol adoption to bring
[18:01.480 --> 18:07.160]  us under un control obama just uses the epa without law to go in and shut power plants down
[18:08.120 --> 18:14.360]  or not allow new power plants to be constructed but then his inside buddies the globalist insiders
[18:14.360 --> 18:19.560]  they get to continue to build and then our power prices go up our factories our businesses can't
[18:19.560 --> 18:26.760]  compete with china mexico india and others who don't have these handcuffs on them and they know
[18:26.760 --> 18:32.440]  exactly what they're doing and it's about his insider buddies getting away with this but i'm
[18:32.440 --> 18:42.760]  fundamentally angry a year and a half ago at the copenhagen denmark summit when they had the united
[18:42.760 --> 18:48.840]  nations there and they openly came out and said and schwarzenegger led the delegation they said
[18:48.840 --> 18:53.720]  don't worry we read the headlines at the time if you want to pull them up just schwarzenegger
[18:53.720 --> 18:59.880]  to lead states and cities to implement kiyoto and bypass congress that was one of the headlines
[18:59.880 --> 19:05.080]  and he was there going what we're going to do is go to the cities and the states and set up the

[25:58.440 --> 26:05.000]  show because you made that search term obama triggers blackouts number one and i saw it had
[26:05.000 --> 26:10.600]  to be more than 50 articles i didn't count them all up of news covering it and talking about it
[26:10.600 --> 26:15.720]  and we got this central issue out there i mean i played the clip yesterday in fact if you can
[26:15.720 --> 26:21.480]  cue it up the 13 second clip there's a bunch of others of obama and biden and others saying yeah
[26:21.480 --> 26:27.160]  we're going to shut down all coal powered plants it's our mission to bankrupt them and then they
[26:27.160 --> 26:32.200]  lie and say they're toxic they say carbon dioxide's toxic it's not but they've got to go out for
[26:32.200 --> 26:35.960]  carbon dioxide because there's nothing else coming out of these things oh they're dirty in china and
[26:35.960 --> 26:42.280]  mexico and other places no controls on them like they were here 80 years ago but they send the smoke
[26:42.280 --> 26:47.320]  left over from the coal that's burned to turn the big turbines uh in the water that generates
[26:47.320 --> 26:52.440]  electricity you know they boil the water with the coal turn the turbines it's similar to hydroelectric
[26:52.440 --> 26:57.880]  basically it's a it's a form of that but generated by the coal burning and they send it through layer
[26:57.880 --> 27:03.560]  after layer after layer of tubing with water spraying through it and it takes it all out
[27:04.520 --> 27:09.960]  now do they go store that toxic waste no they put it in your water but see obama's not worried
[27:09.960 --> 27:13.240]  about that oh yeah that's where sodium fluoride comes from the so-called thing they call sodium
[27:13.240 --> 27:19.960]  fluoride the hundreds of leftover horrible ingredients of coal uh are then put in to the
[27:20.600 --> 27:26.680]  water supply is there something better than coal yes do i think we should try to move away from
[27:29.080 --> 27:35.800]  petroleum products yes but our whole society is designed and built around it and the globalists
[27:35.800 --> 27:40.520]  aren't trying to put us on to clean energies they're only directing federal funds worldwide
[27:40.520 --> 27:47.160]  into insider crony operations of al gore bill clinton george soros the roth childs the rockefeller's
[27:47.160 --> 27:54.280]  on record and for every job in spain created with green jobs it cost two jobs the spanish
[27:54.280 --> 28:00.040]  government admitted last year and it doesn't supply the type of power you need you lose power
[28:00.040 --> 28:05.960]  when you generate it out on the plains or on the coast and send it hundreds of miles in to major
[28:05.960 --> 28:15.160]  cities you lose that power going over the power lines i mean this is so simple it isn't a good
[28:15.160 --> 28:22.120]  system the way they've currently designed it and they could never the studies have shown get enough
[28:22.120 --> 28:28.680]  of this wind to run our society and it's not fair that a hundred and sixty plus third world
[28:28.680 --> 28:35.320]  countries don't have to make these carbon cuts but we do and then you find out it's a vertical
[28:35.320 --> 28:41.960]  integration system where general electric and others get exemptions on their plants and their
[28:41.960 --> 28:47.720]  building of plants and their competition doesn't and who runs the obama's economic council and
[28:47.720 --> 28:54.840]  sets policy for him the former head of general electric who runs the white house as the chief
[28:54.840 --> 29:02.040]  of staff now one of the daily mob brothers of course of goldman sacks jp morgan forget which
[29:02.040 --> 29:09.560]  one it is the point is is that through government they get to engineer sweetheart deals for themselves
[29:09.560 --> 29:15.880]  that are illegal and i go back to it over 500 waivers i haven't counted in a few months and it
[29:15.880 --> 29:20.600]  was over 500 two months ago two giant companies should not have to buy insurance for their employees
[29:20.600 --> 29:25.080]  but your company does and if this health care gets implemented this year i'm going to have to lay
[29:25.080 --> 29:30.360]  people off or say okay i got to take a 30 year paycheck to pay for this because i'm going to
[29:30.360 --> 29:35.720]  match it and now we got to buy you this insurance and but don't worry other companies that get
[29:35.720 --> 29:40.840]  waivers they will be able to outcompete myself and everybody else because they don't have to get it
[29:40.840 --> 29:45.400]  i mean this is mafia government all right we're going to come back into your phone calls get in

[37:48.680 --> 37:53.080]  the more plants he can have shut down the more plants he can put taxes on and restrict their
[37:53.080 --> 37:57.960]  output the more money the insiders will make because it will create artificial scarcity

[38:14.920 --> 38:20.200]  funds and more and more taxes going up and the money being paid to offshore banks uh
[38:20.200 --> 38:23.880]  that the money's not even owed to because they've tied the government to fraudulent derivatives
[38:23.880 --> 38:27.880]  no you also get restrictions on the right to self-defense and private property
[38:28.600 --> 38:36.360]  the toll-free number to join us on air is 800 259 9231 but i will just say this one more time
[38:37.320 --> 38:43.320]  this fraud is so out in the open so preposterous that the government is giving insiders waivers
[38:43.320 --> 38:49.080]  from getting health care for unfair trade advantage and discrimination that the
[38:49.080 --> 38:55.400]  the unelected bureaucrats at the epa are shutting down power plants that aren't insiders
[38:55.400 --> 38:59.480]  all of this is illegal and criminal and there needs to be congressional
[38:59.480 --> 39:04.040]  and state investigations and they're actually starting by the way on the health care on the
[39:04.040 --> 39:10.920]  waivers on the power plants it's on it's on we've got the moral high ground we've got the facts
[39:10.920 --> 39:16.120]  the only way they're going to succeed and win is if we sit on our big hind ends
[39:16.120 --> 39:21.400]  and you may not think calling it a talk radio on some other show and talking about these issues
[39:21.400 --> 39:25.240]  will help or you may not think the drudge report linking to our story is going to help or you may
[39:25.240 --> 39:29.720]  not think the attorney general of texas suing over the attempt for the feds to shut down our
[39:29.720 --> 39:34.360]  power plants is going to help it is helping we're winning a lot of fights the globalists
[39:34.360 --> 39:40.680]  just become even more criminal and implement all this outside of law so we keep fighting victory
[39:40.680 --> 39:46.600]  goes to who wants it the most simply looking at the information and researching leads to victory
[39:46.600 --> 39:53.320]  because then you're informed resistance is victory janis in texas you're on the air worldwide
[39:54.520 --> 40:00.680]  hello alex how are you today i'm good good um well this all doesn't surprise me i and i've been
[40:00.680 --> 40:05.080]  meaning to call in about this for i mean it's been going on for about a year it's been in the back
[40:05.080 --> 40:10.520]  of my mind but i thought i'd call about it today i've noticed that um there's been a rash of coal
[40:10.520 --> 40:17.160]  mine explosions and and it seemed very suspect to me and there was one explosion in west virginia
[40:17.720 --> 40:24.200]  and it was about i guess maybe about a year ago and jay rockefeller was actually in front of the
[40:24.200 --> 40:30.840]  mine in his day clothes saying how concerned he was about the miners and how this was all wrong
[40:30.840 --> 40:37.320]  and if the law allowed this then he was just going to have to change the law and on that same
[40:37.320 --> 40:43.320]  story like it was like during that that the first like cycle of news before they get the official
[40:43.320 --> 40:51.080]  story um cnn interviewed one of the miners wives and she said that that her husband who went to
[40:51.080 --> 40:57.240]  that mine who actually got killed in that explosion um had written letters to all their daughters like
[40:57.240 --> 41:02.200]  these farewell letters like do good in school and you know whatever well that's because that's
[41:02.200 --> 41:08.360]  because west virginian coal miners have the most dangerous job per capita uh in the united states
[41:08.360 --> 41:13.480]  except for deep sea industrial divers they actually have the most dangerous but after that it is the
[41:13.480 --> 41:19.960]  coal miners but deep sea divers are paid you know 150 000 a year uh on average and the coal miners
[41:19.960 --> 41:25.480]  are making maybe 50 they certainly deserve more uh but but uh a jannis do you have anything else to
[41:25.480 --> 41:30.760]  add because i have something to add to it after you're done well just just after that alex i just
[41:30.760 --> 41:36.760]  noticed you know there there was the the chili uh explosion i think there were a couple there then
[41:36.760 --> 41:42.440]  china i mean there's just been one after the other and it seemed to be happening on the clock monthly
[41:42.440 --> 41:47.560]  and they were all blaming uh methane gas like they couldn't go in to search for the miners
[41:47.560 --> 41:52.760]  because of the methane that's that's really all i have i just it just seemed really weird well
[41:52.760 --> 41:57.560]  no listen i appreciate your call it's just like you might get more crazy weather one year
[41:57.560 --> 42:04.280]  then you get another year a lot of this is just random uh you know some days there's more murders
[42:04.280 --> 42:12.760]  in a city than others uh some days you know there's more car accidents uh but deep coal mines are one
[42:12.760 --> 42:19.080]  of the most dangerous jobs out there i already said that everybody knows that but the federal
[42:19.080 --> 42:25.240]  government has blocked one of the biggest deposits in the world is clean burning coal in utah that is
[42:25.880 --> 42:31.560]  close to the surface in the lignite family and they blocked it in most other states
[42:31.560 --> 42:36.520]  texas it gets blocked in most places there's enough lignite in texas they conservatively
[42:36.520 --> 42:40.680]  to run the united states for more than a hundred years uh they talk about it being more than a
[42:40.680 --> 42:45.640]  thousand years uh what's in the entire country just that's been discovered i mean there's lignite
[42:45.640 --> 42:52.840]  just all over the place uh we've got a uh you know family farm and ranch uh that uh
[42:53.800 --> 42:57.800]  you know they discovered lignite on but they've never you know gone in or come in and leased it
[42:57.800 --> 43:03.960]  and done it uh but the issue here is lignite is taken out with big trucks it's near the surface
[43:03.960 --> 43:09.400]  and there's almost no danger in lignite mining i mean it is just big bulldozers big giant bulldozers
[43:11.000 --> 43:14.600]  if you haven't ever driven by one of these mines it's unbelievable i mean you could park
[43:14.600 --> 43:19.480]  in some of these bulldozers i i saw in the newspaper article i think six school buses
[43:19.480 --> 43:25.560]  just in the back of the bulldozer they got these giant scoops just just dumping the black coal
[43:25.560 --> 43:31.720]  into the back of them and so you've got these globalists though that own coal mines in brazil
[43:31.720 --> 43:36.360]  and coal mines in china and coal mines in eastern europe and where they don't have any
[43:36.360 --> 43:41.080]  environmental standards so they want to shut down the mines here and then make you get it
[43:41.080 --> 43:47.560]  from overseas i mean bill clinton got caught doing this in 1996 uh that what is the million acres
[43:47.560 --> 43:51.880]  or more of clean burning coal companies wanted to go in and extract it after they're done they
[43:51.880 --> 43:56.440]  come into plant grasslands and trees it's beautiful a lot of times humans make things even look better
[43:56.440 --> 44:00.760]  after they've done it i've seen out in east texas and south texas where lignite mines were and it's
[44:00.760 --> 44:05.160]  just it looks like a you know five thousand acre park or something now that's private property you
[44:05.160 --> 44:11.080]  drive by and it's just like rolling green perfect hills and beautiful trees planted everywhere and
[44:11.080 --> 44:15.960]  the animals just love it but but that's because forests go through cycles and generally when a
[44:15.960 --> 44:20.120]  forest is new it's a lot healthier but that's a side issue that's why natural burning from
[44:20.120 --> 44:25.240]  lightning and things is so healthy to you know change the overall ecology and and and to put
[44:25.240 --> 44:32.200]  more nutrients into the soil but from the fire but i digress it is suspicious uh but what's
[44:32.200 --> 44:37.400]  certainly suspicious is the way they seize on it to demonize coal and regardless of what you think
[44:37.400 --> 44:42.840]  of coal regardless of what you think about it uh it's what's powering 51 percent of this country
[44:42.840 --> 44:47.320]  and our civilization couldn't stand without it and there's insider deals to shut off
[44:49.160 --> 44:53.400]  private enterprise in this country that would make it inexpensive through free market and make it
[44:53.400 --> 44:58.760]  very expensive through inside deals and that's basically you know all i can say about that issue
[44:58.760 --> 45:03.720]  uh but uh i don't want to destroy the west virginians way of life but west virginians
[45:03.720 --> 45:08.040]  you're welcome down here in texas the autogist you know at least come down here part of the
[45:08.040 --> 45:12.360]  year and work in the lignite mines because you're not going to get hurt doing that going deep down
[45:12.360 --> 45:17.800]  into mines is super dangerous in deep coal mining and it's it's it's it's quite frankly pointless
[45:17.800 --> 45:22.920]  i mean i think that they should be allowed to do it if they want but it's government restrictions
[45:22.920 --> 45:31.720]  on lignite mining that's stopping uh economically uh from being feasible to stop the deep mining
[45:31.720 --> 45:37.160]  woody in seattle woody you're on the air hey thanks alex how you doing today doing all right sir
[45:37.160 --> 45:41.480]  welcome you know i was listening to you the other day and you're talking about three-dimensional
[45:41.480 --> 45:48.520]  chess and that's exactly what we're seeing with the middle east we're seeing chess pieces that were
[45:48.520 --> 45:55.080]  put into place 30 years ago under the carter administration coming into their now glory
[45:55.960 --> 46:02.680]  and they're setting up this class of civilizations so they can blame it on religion and then they
[46:02.680 --> 46:08.040]  could fit into their new world order philosophy of all religion is bad except for the religion of
[46:08.040 --> 46:12.520]  worshiping the earth and by the way people are bad for the earth and by the way the un
[46:12.520 --> 46:17.640]  officially says in their 1996 biological diversity assessment but in literally hundreds of other
[46:17.640 --> 46:22.440]  documents i've read i'm sure there's thousands but i'm only read hundreds that man needs a religion
[46:22.440 --> 46:27.800]  we're going to replace it with a fascistic guy or religion with a militarized priest class of
[46:27.800 --> 46:33.080]  climate cops that enforce it that's what university heads are saying every week in the news so it's
[46:33.080 --> 46:40.120]  not your opinion that is their stated goal well it's becoming obvious i think to anybody that's
[46:40.120 --> 46:46.600]  enlightened that we're being steered towards this clash of civilizations between the islamic world and
[46:46.600 --> 46:52.520]  the judeo christian world and it's not that the people who believe in these religions who have
[46:52.520 --> 47:00.200]  these faiths are doing it it's that the globalists with all their uh the intelligence networks
[47:00.200 --> 47:07.800]  and all of their military and political power are staring us down this path well i agree with you
[47:07.800 --> 47:14.360]  and if israel is being menaced on all sides they're going to get even more us funding
[47:14.360 --> 47:17.960]  and they're going to be able to crack down on their press and their population even more
[47:17.960 --> 47:22.120]  just like our criminal government by staging terror attacks and funding terrorist and
[47:23.160 --> 47:28.520]  allowing terrorists to attack us then uses that as a pretext to take our liberty and once you
[47:28.520 --> 47:37.240]  understand the modus operandi once you understand uh the system that they're using and and and and
[47:37.240 --> 47:42.520]  what their methodology is it's all crystal clear i mean i began to understand this methodology
[47:42.520 --> 47:47.320]  really about 15 years ago when i hadn't even read all these documents and now i'll read
[47:47.320 --> 47:53.080]  declassified globalist documents and it's as if i'd already read them word for word because i can
[47:53.080 --> 47:59.560]  see them you know once you see their system and see their propaganda you can extrapolate it out
[47:59.560 --> 48:04.360]  but then there's the verification by actually having the documents and if you go back further
[48:04.360 --> 48:08.600]  in the history you just look at world war two what hitler did in the middle east you know going
[48:08.600 --> 48:17.560]  into uh jerusalem and getting the movie behind him to uh you know do his work and he just picked up
[48:17.560 --> 48:21.480]  the network the british had set up to the muslim brotherhood and then after he fell the british
[48:21.480 --> 48:25.880]  just picked it back up again i appreciate your call gray points yeah they're destabilizing the
[48:25.880 --> 48:31.160]  middle east order out of chaos as henry kissinger said earlier this week uh that this is only the
[48:31.160 --> 48:36.680]  first uh scene in the first act of a play and brazinski's written two books bragging about
[48:36.680 --> 48:41.880]  how this would happen he wrote one of them in 97 predicting it all and now he's on tv bragging
[48:41.880 --> 48:48.200]  they love to brag how they've engineered this whole thing look they know when they have thousands
[48:48.200 --> 48:53.160]  of predator bombing attacks in pakistan and afghanistan every month targeting weddings you know well
[48:53.160 --> 48:58.760]  if we kill one bad guy and kill 250 innocents men women and children that's okay well now you've
[48:58.760 --> 49:04.520]  created 250 people whose wives and kids and husbands got killed and and their tribal folks
[49:04.520 --> 49:08.360]  over there just like americans once were an eye for an eye and they're like okay i'm going to kill
[49:08.360 --> 49:13.960]  american troops now is what they say because it's their blood honor i mean and now they've
[49:13.960 --> 49:18.600]  created quote terrorist people that are going to fight back and they know exactly what they're
[49:18.600 --> 49:24.600]  doing they're they're stirring up the beehive to then offer the solution of world war three
[49:24.600 --> 49:31.960]  and domestic police state the counter in uh john and ohio you're on the air uh yes uh alex i think
[49:31.960 --> 49:37.560]  you've got it uh backwards on uh the camp david falsely named in the propaganda media the peace
[49:37.560 --> 49:45.400]  treaty i think everything that israel has been able to do uh as so far as invading uh lebanon
[49:45.400 --> 49:52.280]  for 12 years of the massacres of uh sabra shatila the genocide and persecution of the palestinian
[49:52.280 --> 49:57.560]  has been based on this misnamed peace treaty it was really an alliance between this brutal
[49:57.560 --> 50:03.800]  u.s. puppet dictator and israel to guarantee them that they would not only stand aside but
[50:03.800 --> 50:07.640]  help is well sure i don't think that agreement is fair and i i tend to agree with you but but
[50:07.640 --> 50:13.400]  i mean let me just say this are you disagreeing that uh el barate and the muslim brotherhood
[50:13.400 --> 50:18.200]  in these groups are being funded by the west i mean the west admits and they're telling
[50:18.200 --> 50:23.240]  mubarak to step down and you're saying there's nothing to this to the strategy of tension
[50:23.240 --> 50:28.120]  and you think this is great what's happening now what i'm saying is that obviously the uh the u.s.
[50:28.120 --> 50:33.960]  uh military industrial complex israel musad and the cia and the imf i'd like to answer that after
[50:33.960 --> 50:39.480]  the uh after the break here all right okay john uh come back and uh have you get into that john

[54:06.600 --> 54:13.480]  i think john often on some call in the show for about eight years or so and i again don't screen
[54:13.480 --> 54:17.560]  phone calls let folks talk about whatever they want but i was sent a clip a few months ago of john
[54:18.120 --> 54:23.240]  on another radio show saying that alex jones says if you're a critic of israel you're mentally ill
[54:24.120 --> 54:31.160]  and then i've seen the clip that's not what i said i said that i am critical of what israel does
[54:31.160 --> 54:37.400]  but people that say that i work for israel that they are mentally ill and that shows the mental
[54:37.400 --> 54:42.680]  illness right there that someone can say something in clear understandable english and people built
[54:42.680 --> 54:48.840]  straw men about who i am and what i stand for john went on to say that i was for the flotilla attack
[54:48.840 --> 54:53.080]  when i was critical of that attack and said that i thought it was wrong and that the people of
[54:53.080 --> 54:58.760]  gods deserve aid it is a fraud so i don't even know why you call here john to talk about real
[54:58.760 --> 55:05.080]  issues when you are intellectually dishonest on this broadcast and on other broadcast period you
[55:05.080 --> 55:09.880]  just you probably this is not the show for you you're an admitted communist you support communism

[55:45.800 --> 55:51.560]  welcome hi alex i get a little tongue tied i am not a good public speaker but i want to let you
[55:51.560 --> 55:57.720]  know i called c span to talk to the energy senator from new mexico and i brought up the fact to him
[55:58.520 --> 56:03.160]  today about the rolling blackouts and how the you know they're keeping the energy plants
[56:03.160 --> 56:08.680]  going for the hospital um for the super bowl but yet there's people in hospitals that don't have the
[56:08.680 --> 56:15.400]  energy and also that i had read or heard lately i won't mention names about how they're shutting down
[56:15.400 --> 56:20.200]  court and like corpus christy power plants or whatever while china is being able to come in
[56:20.200 --> 56:25.080]  there and set up their own and and the guy and i said they don't have to pass cap and trade no more
[56:25.080 --> 56:30.840]  because the epa is doing it by stealth by the way china is now mining coal in texas taking it to
[56:30.840 --> 56:36.840]  mexico for power plants they own see how the scam works we can't have them and then china and g e
[56:36.840 --> 56:41.480]  build them right on the border and we got to buy it from them and they can hold us hostage this is
[56:41.480 --> 56:47.240]  economic warfare what did he say when you brought up those key points oh he looked kind of dumb found
[56:47.240 --> 56:54.680]  it like he said that well the epa is going to gradually over years get rid of the dirty ones
[56:55.320 --> 57:00.360]  bull that uh he said there are no dirty ones compared to other countries all that's coming
[57:00.360 --> 57:05.240]  out is water vapor and carbon dioxide and they point news cameras at it and say look at the smoke
[57:05.240 --> 57:11.000]  in cold weather it's like when you breathe in cold weather they they know full well what they're doing
[57:11.000 --> 57:16.280]  and and and they love to play dumb this is our energy being cut off and i'm glad that the buzz

[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:06.840]  new power plants being built in the us as part of carbon taxes and the Kyoto protocol is causing
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:12.760]  these rolling blockouts republicans are driving the move to make the patriot act permanent we need
[01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:19.000]  to discuss that a national debt jumped another 105.8 billion in january alone that's obama

[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:27.160]  let's talk to roi in texas roi thanks for holding
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:36.280]  yes sir hey buddy hey i just wanted to say you know something real short you know night after
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:43.480]  night i've been watching msnbc on both msnbc fox uh richard maddow show lauren so donnell
[01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:50.200]  uh uh what's the guy on shepherd smith they're all reporting and not just reporting and actually
[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:57.000]  admitting but condemning the uh provocateur false flag tactics against the protesters in egypt
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:03.960]  but when it comes to any type of uh provocateur activities by police the black block wto protest
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:10.040]  over here there's nothing to be said about it no no i in fact going back early last week it was in
[01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:15.000]  the major egyptian papers it was in the middle eastern papers that it was confirmed that hazy
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:20.680]  mubarak at least on the surface it may have been a reverse false flag where other globalist controlled
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:25.560]  groups within his government were doing it but it looks like it's mubarak were police were dressing
[01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:31.000]  up military dressing up like protesters attacking shops attacking homes to make the demonstrators
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:38.600]  look bad and now uh richard maddow uh on uh msnbc and mr maddow and uh slime ball and others i've
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:44.440]  seen those clips are admitting false flag but in denver and oa the denver post admitted police
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:49.960]  dressed up like anarchist and attacked crowds and police as a pretext to demonize the demonstrations
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:56.600]  they were caught a few years ago in ottawa during a uh spp meeting doing it uh in greece the government
[01:02:56.600 --> 01:03:02.040]  was caught doing it the point is governments do this but when we talk about it we're kooks uh when
[01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:06.280]  our own government's doing it but oh other governments they do do it and they admit that's
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:11.320]  happening i mean what do you think mr maddow is getting out here i don't know it's just
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:17.320]  uh it's unbelievable uh and and and and her in particular uh on her show has uh i mean night
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:21.960]  after night been reporting and condemning this and uh but you'll never hear any mention of it on her
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:26.680]  show or matthew's of anything like that over here and when we do you're right we're labeled uh
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:34.760]  kooks or conspiracy theorists well i don't know what to say about it it's the globalists admit
[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:39.160]  they're orchestrating this it doesn't mean that the powder keg wasn't there and the people don't
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:45.640]  deserve liberty and that i hate mubarak sure but what are they replacing it with well they want

[01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:07.640]  should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:12.600]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much
[01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:17.880]  power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:23.000]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:28.520]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:33.720]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:38.280]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:42.760]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power
[01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:47.480]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information

[01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:13.960]  we've been covering the massive power outages from coast to coast people going without electricity
[01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:20.840]  natural gas because through the Kyoto protocol being implemented in the last five years by fiat
[01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:27.160]  by the executive branch under bush and now accelerated under obama our energy infrastructure
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:33.080]  has been debilitated by design and only insiders like general electric are allowed to build new
[01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:38.200]  plants they're also building a bunch of plants along the texas mexico border because texas can't
[01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:42.920]  build new plants we got to get our power from mexico and now mexico yesterday cut off our power
[01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:49.240]  saying they need it source on that fox news and associated press also obviously we're covering

[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:18.920]  by the west just like mubarak has been run by the west but for the rest of the hour after
[01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:24.280]  i take a few more calls we're going to talk to pharmacist ben fuchs and uh just some amazing
[01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:30.200]  research information he's put together he's a sunday afternoon uh genesis broadcaster and
[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:34.760]  i'm really impressed at a chance to meet him when i was out in california uh when he traveled to
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:40.680]  hear me speak there so i look forward to having uh him on with us today talking about bad drug
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:45.320]  interactions what he witnessed as a pharmacist and the research he's done he's also the co-host of
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:52.200]  dead doctors don't lie uh with dr joel wallach uh so very very informative but i wanted to finish
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:56.920]  up with a few callers before we go to him darin if you just tuned in was saying i just woke up a few
[01:09:56.920 --> 01:10:01.480]  months ago i feel like i've fallen down the rabbit hole into the matrix it's freaking me out uh what
[01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:06.120]  was the other point you wanted to make or your question uh darin well you know it's it's just
[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:10.360]  like no what do we do to protect us up this point you know i mean the recent like said my friend's
[01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:14.280]  been i've been training working out my friend he's been giving me all this information he says
[01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:18.920]  you know look it up look it up i looked at the denver airport listen to you know you know uh
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:23.560]  the old governor jesse uh vantor you know whatever that's all about but you know i just
[01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:28.200]  started wrestling i'm concerned it's going how do we stand up how do we arise how do we how do we
[01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:33.560]  prevail how do how do people say you know this this this stuff is coming you know the bible and
[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:39.000]  all these people religion whatever it's going you know darin darin let me let me answer you
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:44.920]  off air uh because it's a it's a really important question awakening is a process first you've
[01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:49.640]  got to get informed about basic history our bill of rights our constitution and then get
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:55.160]  informed about how tyranny and corruption operates it always behaves the same we're just living in
[01:10:55.160 --> 01:11:01.400]  a different time and then you realize that simply by saying no to tyranny by speaking out by not
[01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:07.080]  just watching television and obsessing on things like a super bowl that at the end of the day don't
[01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:13.400]  matter by by valuing liberty and getting others to value liberty it's a process to turn the tide
[01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:18.920]  and that's beginning to happen and it's happening right now by you tuning in and trying to discover

[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.880]  on a couple things i've been listening all week you've had a great week with a lot of different
[01:11:55.880 --> 01:12:02.760]  subjects um first of all you had kurt haskell on the show yes uh yeah and now what a what a great
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:07.720]  guy i wish him all the best his story is really important for those that don't know what for
[01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:13.480]  those who just tuned in why don't you just briefly recap what the lawyer the survivor of the christmas
[01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:20.440]  day bombing attack on the airplane uh discovered well without without going into too much they
[01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:24.600]  can look it up themselves of course but uh he's uh he's basically being misrepresented his his
[01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:30.120]  story is being laughed at in many ways and i don't i don't really uh i can't believe it uh personally
[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:33.720]  i think i don't know who's laughing at it i mean i mean i mean i don't know who's laughing at it
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:38.840]  shawney he and his wife saw them help the government helped get the underwear bomber
[01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:44.360]  metalob on the plane and uh then it came out two months later the state department admitted the
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:49.320]  u.s government helped him get on the plane and he's been completely vindicated uh and i quite
[01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:54.760]  frankly haven't seen the people that quote make fun of him uh but uh i mean there it is right there
[01:12:55.640 --> 01:13:00.280]  money on his blog and stuff is a bit ridiculous you know he's trying to tell his story as truthfully
[01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:05.640]  as possible and i think more people need to listen to him that's really my point um another issue
[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:10.200]  that i had to bring up here is a lot you get a lot of callers concerning chemtrails which is a
[01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:14.760]  which is a big issue here in canada especially near our borders here um the states uh concerning
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:19.480]  washington montana north dakota of course yeah weather modification mm-hmm yeah that we get a
[01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:23.640]  lot of blow over from factories there and also the chemtrail issue uh it's a big issue up here
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:28.600]  in canada and i'd like to hear more about that um i do have a small favor to ask uh from you if you
[01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:33.560]  uh if you would do me a favor and just maybe uh have a show or a piece of a show that's concerning
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:39.320]  canada and america's relations um i know that uh president obama was up here today i believe talking
[01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:45.240]  with prime minister harper uh concerning border security uh talking more about tightening up on
[01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:50.600]  on terrorists and yeah that's the that's the spp north american union agreement i appreciate your
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:56.840]  call great points uh sean my seminal film two and a half hours long in game blueprint for global
[01:13:56.840 --> 01:14:02.600]  enslavement deals with north american union the spp how canada mexico and the us in a secret
[01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:08.680]  agreement signed in 2005 have already been merged in 2007 they began merging with north american union
[01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:14.440]  with the eu uh this film is so important in game blueprint for global enslavement and
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:20.280]  it's available on dvd at info wars dot com the online video bookstore shopping cart you can watch
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:25.720]  it in the highest quality at prison planet dot tv or just google endgame blueprint for global
[01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:30.600]  enslavement or just in game it's the top link it's free millions and millions of views online
[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:36.600]  and i just and it's got an online bibliography like a book you go to what is the in game dot com
[01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:42.200]  um but if i was you i'd organize viewings of this film i mean this gives you the full spectrum
[01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:49.960]  breakdown but there's a continuity of agenda everything being done in your country is being
[01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:55.720]  set up here under just almost the same name sometimes the exact same names and so it's this
[01:14:55.720 --> 01:15:00.920]  global i mean what is your leader harper just called for two months ago he said canada's got
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:06.040]  to give up its sovereignty to a world government to compete they get us into globalism it's destroyed
[01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:11.960]  our our sovereignty it's it's it's hurt our economy and their answer is more of the same poison
[01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:16.040]  so there you have it in fact i said i'd play this earlier and i'm going to play it again
[01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:21.720]  do we have the clip of obama saying that he wants to bankrupt cold plants let's play that clip
[01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:25.320]  right now i mean they want to destroy their competition they don't want to destroy all the
[01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:31.880]  cold plants not general electric not the chinese owned plants in the u.s only companies that aren't
[01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:36.840]  part of the inner circle if this is an economic warfare what is what is the north american union
[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:41.080]  it's taking over our roads our highways putting international taxes on them letting foreign
[01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:45.320]  corporations come in and take over our roads this is what's happened in the third world it's
[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:51.080]  happening here and here's obama engaged in treason promising to bankrupt cold plants he's done it
[01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:55.400]  he's blocked them from being built he's shut down existing ones and we're having blackouts all over
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:16:00.520]  the country and china's building three to five new plants a week we don't get three new ones a year
[01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:07.320]  it's real simple it's economic warfare here it is so if somebody wants to build a cold power plant
[01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:15.800]  they can it's just that it will bankrupt them because they're going to be charged a huge sum
[01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:24.360]  for all that greenhouse gas that's being emitted you know computers are a weird thing and we've
[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:31.640]  got thousands of clips in there in the computer and only that clip plays at uh 75 speed like obama's
[01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:36.520]  drunk reload it and play it again it's people think we edited it and maybe it'll play right this
[01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:40.920]  time now here's obama again so if somebody wants to build a cold power plant they can
[01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:47.240]  it's just that it will bankrupt them because they're going to be charged a huge sum for all that
[01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:53.560]  greenhouse gas that's being emitted okay so that time it played in the right speed but didn't show
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:59.960]  the video i believe that three is the charm let's reload it and three will be the magic charm with
[01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:05.080]  us today let let let who wants to place bets on this because i know the disinformation operatives
[01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:09.080]  out there they'll say it's a fake clip or something by the way you just type in obama promises to shut
[01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:14.360]  down coal you'll get clip after clip after clip and that's just one short one you'll get biden
[01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:19.080]  saying and i mean they're on record but but let's see if three's the charm here here it is again
[01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:24.280]  so if somebody wants to build a cold power plant they can it's just that it will bankrupt them because
[01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:30.040]  they're going to be charged a huge sum for all that greenhouse gas that's being emitted
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:38.760]  boom three was the charm absolutely amazing okay we're going to get back to chris jason tim
[01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:43.800]  will have open phones throughout the next hour if you want to hold you can if not you can call back
[01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:48.200]  later uh we'll have open phones when bob Chapman joins us and continue to look at the deteriorating
[01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:55.080]  dollar and the economy and the attacks on free speech but for the rest of the hour i i've heard
[01:17:55.080 --> 01:18:04.120]  this guy show uh on uh genesis sundays uh and i'm impressed with it i heard it one day when i wasn't

[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:27.160]  on genesis sundays and also he co-hosts dead doctors don't lie and from my research and by
[01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:33.000]  the way i've just started uh taking some of the stuff that's recommended by by uh pharmacist ben

[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:51.640]  because they have minerals in them and and and it's and and they have b vitamins and other
[01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:57.960]  key things but but but the issue is our food because of the soils in this country and the toxic
[01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:05.480]  fertilizers has been basically uh adulterated with chemicals and additives but also doesn't have the
[01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:10.200]  minerals in it and so many of the problems are caused by mineral deficiencies but that's only
[01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:15.240]  one level of this but i want to talk to pharmacist ben fuchs specifically about formally being a
[01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:21.480]  mainline pharmacist what he saw with bad drug interactions and these toxic drugs i mean you

[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:49.000]  movie that was done to promote this drug in the first 15 minutes they talked about how revolutionary
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:55.000]  this drug was going to be the last 45 minutes was some lady reading the side effects of this drug
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:58.920]  and she was reading them very fast and she could barely get them through in 45 minutes and right
[01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:03.400]  then and there i knew we had we had a problem and then when i graduated pharmacy school and
[01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:09.080]  started to work in the drug business i started to see what i was actually doing as a a perpetrator
[01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:14.280]  as a perp perp uh pushing these medicines on children and on the elderly because that's
[01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:18.600]  who takes most of our medicine is children and the elderly and i just couldn't live with myself
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:23.240]  and the more and more i did research the more i found out that we are not sick in this country
[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:29.880]  we're starving we're missing basic raw materials you see alex the human body is a healing and
[01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:35.960]  regenerating system it's designed on a divine basis to heal and renew itself on a moment-to-moment
[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:41.080]  basis and you need look no further than the last time you cut your finger to observe this healing
[01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:45.480]  process in place and that same healing process that kicks in when you get a little paper cut
[01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:50.280]  where uh little fibers wind their way to the area and collagen comes through and white blood cells
[01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:54.680]  clear it out and all of a sudden two days later you don't even know you have a cut that same process
[01:26:54.680 --> 01:27:01.000]  happens inside the body it happens on a regular basis it's divinely mandated but it needs raw
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:06.040]  materials to do its work and those raw materials or what we call nutrition and nutritional
[01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:11.000]  supplementation and those are the raw materials that we're missing we're missing them as you said
[01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:16.040]  last hour from the ground up we're missing them from the soils we're missing them from the plants
[01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:22.120]  we're missing them from food processing and the net effect is degenerative diseases are increasing
[01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:28.440]  at an epidemic rate and it is a tragic tragic state of affairs and this is known by science this is
[01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:34.600]  known in all their big internal studies this is known by doctors and veterinarians you know one
[01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:39.240]  of the biggest deals uh issues that that that people that own livestock deal with is mineral
[01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:43.720]  deficiencies that cause all sorts of health problems you know that then hurt the overall
[01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:49.560]  output of the farm or ranch this is not a secret to those that do the research but i mean here's
[01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:55.800]  a just a historical example why are british called limies you know germans get called
[01:27:55.800 --> 01:28:00.120]  crowds because they like to eat sauerkraut why are british called limies well going back over
[01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:06.920]  300 years uh internal british naval reports their scientists found that for whatever reason people
[01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:12.920]  that didn't eat fresh fruits uh had their skin degenerate their teeth fall out old wounds would
[01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:19.720]  open back up and they knew that if they simply ate fruits that for some reason uh they then
[01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:25.240]  wouldn't die when they went on long voyages and so the british empire spread for many reasons
[01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:32.600]  but one of the biggest was their sailors 5000 miles from home engaging a spanish ship 5000
[01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:37.560]  miles from home or a french ship and the french and spanish by the way made jokes for hundreds of
[01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:43.160]  years about the british how they carried limes with them everywhere calling them limies and to
[01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:48.360]  make sure that the people on the ship would drink it uh they would squeeze the lime into the rum
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:55.160]  into the grog uh you know part water part uh rum that they gave the sailors because they knew they
[01:28:55.160 --> 01:29:00.440]  drank the the liquor and so they would mix that lime in and so the british would be all healthy
[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:05.160]  and ready to kill some people when their ship came up alongside the board and the spanish or the
[01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:08.760]  french would all be laying out on the deck with their teeth falling out the number one cause of
[01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:13.960]  death for sailors obviously being scurvy and that's an example right there of just vitamin c
[01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:19.240]  needed in collagen that's exactly right and just a tiny little bit of vitamin c and if you don't
[01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:23.000]  have that tiny little bit of vitamin c as you said you get scurvy which is one of the most
[01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:28.440]  hideous diseases known to man but you know what alex you need more than that tiny little bit of
[01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:33.000]  vitamin c for optimum health and that's one of the biggest scams going in the world and that's
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:38.440]  what nobel prize winner two-time nobel prize winner line is pauling uh found but they don't
[01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:43.320]  want the and now the un's moving to block taking mega doses of vitamin c let's talk about that a
[01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:55.160]  lot more with pharmacist ben fugue straight ahead we're on the march the empires on the run alex

[01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:16.360]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:24.760]  there is no doubt that the medical system not the average doctor they're compartmentalized not
[01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:30.120]  the average pharmacist or nurse but the medical system itself wants to treat the disease not
[01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:34.680]  give you preventative measures we're talking about this with insider you know formerly a
[01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:40.440]  mainline pharmacist talk show host ben fuchs uh been continuing i just use the example of scurvy
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:46.200]  let's continue with scurvy and then look at what other mineral or vitamin deficiencies do
[01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:51.240]  and how when people go into the hospital or the doctor now they don't even look at that
[01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:55.560]  they don't even look at deficiencies they don't test the blood they just give you
[01:33:55.560 --> 01:34:01.640]  some toxic uh pharmacological garbage of course and that alex they take you off your supplements
[01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:05.160]  if you're on supplements because they don't want the supplements to interfere with the
[01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:10.120]  talk oh yeah i hear dr dina del every week when i tune in he's on a local station before i go on
[01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:16.120]  sundays and i've had dr dean on before i hear him say vitamins are bad for you he'll bring out these
[01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:21.880]  government you know studies uh he'll say that you don't need them i mean it's crazy alice you
[01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:28.280]  ever hear the term a useful idiot yes well let me tell you something with all due respect to the
[01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:34.920]  good doctor that term is very appropriate i don't know what his intentions are maybe i'm sure he's a
[01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:39.000]  nice guy but to go out and to tell people that they need to go off of their vitamins
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:45.480]  the vitamins cause problems is absolutely at best irresponsible and at worst it's insidious and
[01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:51.960]  evil the fact of the matter is vitamins have zero side effects vitamins have and and by the way i
[01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:57.000]  i don't mean just vitamins vitamins and minerals and uh what we call nutritional compounds have
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:01.800]  zero side effects zero toxicities zero adverse effects the worst thing that can happen is you
[01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:06.920]  could take a 500 vitamin a pills and go into something called hypervitaminosis which immediately
[01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:12.280]  reverses as soon as you stop taking the vitamins unlike prescription drugs which are a leading
[01:35:12.280 --> 01:35:17.640]  cause of death which are a leading cause of hospitalizations fifth leading cause of death
[01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:21.000]  according to the journal of the america and by the way you're a pharmacist and you know my
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:27.560]  dad's my dad's a dentist and i've seen him call a pharmacist friend of his to ask him a drug
[01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:33.000]  interacts my dad's really smart but he'll tell you a pharmacist knows more than he does because
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:37.800]  you deal with this every day and i know medical doctors will call and check with pharmacists
[01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:43.880]  about interactions because you guys are the experts with all due respect doctors they are trained in
[01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:47.960]  hiding symptoms and masking symptoms and i should clarify that there's two types of medicine
[01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:54.280]  there is what we call heroic medicine where by the way uh american medicine excels a gunshot wound
[01:35:54.280 --> 01:36:00.520]  of a compound fracture heart attacks stitching you up get hit by a car or a bus that's called
[01:36:00.520 --> 01:36:05.480]  heroic medicine and and nobody ever gives short shrift to surgeons or people who practice heroic
[01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:12.760]  medicine where medicine is an abject failure an abject failure is pharmacium ambulatory medicine
[01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:18.360]  where people are being treated for their symptoms well alex your symptoms are your friends your
[01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:23.480]  diabetes is your friend your psoriasis your arthritis is your friend because it's telling you
[01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:28.520]  there is something underneath in the biochemistry of your body that needs to be corrected or your
[01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:33.720]  demise is imminent the idea is not to hide the symptom the idea is not to mask the symptom
[01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:38.920]  the idea is not to shut the body down the idea is to figure out what is wrong what is the body
[01:36:38.920 --> 01:36:43.560]  trying to tell you and to correct that problem and more often than not it is based in the
[01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:48.440]  nutritional system and that's why nutritional supplementation is an absolute absolute must
[01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:52.920]  it is not an option especially in this day and age of health insurance where we're all
[01:36:52.920 --> 01:36:56.440]  everybody's screaming and up in arms about buying health insurance being forced to buy
[01:36:56.440 --> 01:37:01.160]  in health insurance the costs of health insurance my friends there is no better health insurance
[01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:05.960]  and there is no less expensive health insurance than three dollars a day on a nutritional
[01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:10.680]  supplementation program well why have you seen the statistics from australia to the united states
[01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:14.680]  it's the same because our industrial growth was almost identical but the same thing in western
[01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:23.160]  europe up until about 1935 or so suddenly people started living longer suddenly people started
[01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:28.200]  having less diseases they were drinking better water they were getting more nutrients they were
[01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:35.880]  getting better heroic medicine they we had better sewage systems people knew to wash their hands
[01:37:36.520 --> 01:37:43.960]  then vaccines and drugs come in and suddenly we see a lot of that life extension gain being
[01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:49.560]  reversed now across the board please continue life expectancy just dropped you know average
[01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:53.960]  life expectancy the united states just actually dropped the last year a slight drop but i predict
[01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:57.320]  it's going to be dropping even further and it's the first time in decades that that's happened now
[01:37:57.320 --> 01:38:03.000]  what what occurred alex is we really up until about the the middle of the 20th century we really
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:07.960]  did use nutrition physicians really did practice nutritional medicine and we understood the power
[01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:12.760]  of the diet but right around the middle of the century the the pharmaceutical industry started
[01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:18.200]  to understand how the body could be manipulated how the body could be manipulated so that symptoms
[01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:24.040]  could be hidden this really began with the advent of steroid medicine around the the middle of the
[01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:29.400]  20th century rheumatoid arthritis was a real killer disease and it's still a pretty horrible
[01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:33.160]  disease we don't see folks with rheumatoid arthritis too bad yeah it was the germans that
[01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:38.200]  pioneered steroid medicine well what happened was when steroid medicine came out steroids
[01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:43.320]  shut down the immune system rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease where the immune system
[01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:47.960]  goes awry and starts to attack itself well when steroids came out we figured out how to shut down
[01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:51.800]  the immune system well temporarily if you shut down the immune system you're not going to have
[01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:56.600]  rheumatoid arthritis and that was then your body doesn't fight off the cancer exactly do you think
[01:38:56.600 --> 01:39:01.400]  it's a good idea to ever shut down your immune system hello doctors out there it's estimated
[01:39:01.400 --> 01:39:07.240]  it's estimated according to the federal government reports i've seen that a 20 year old gets cancer
[01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:12.680]  a couple times a year that a 70 year old is getting an almost every day but the body is beating it
[01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:19.720]  and it's when your autoimmune system stops killing the cancer every day it's over you never want to
[01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:25.000]  shut down your immune system it is absolutely ridiculous to think that by shutting down the
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:29.640]  immune system you can improve health but alex that's how medicine works medicine works by
[01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:34.680]  blocking things medicine works by suppressing things medicine works by shutting things down
[01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:40.520]  that's why we have anti-inflammatories that's why we have anti-hypertensives that's why you have
[01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:47.000]  inhibitor drugs drug you have a serotonin reuptake inhibitors you don't want to shut the body down
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:52.440]  the body is like your baby and when you have some kind of symptom your baby is crying now if you
[01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:56.840]  take some duct tape and shut tape your baby's mouth you're not going to hear your baby crying
[01:39:56.840 --> 01:40:01.320]  and that's all great but you're going to kill your baby well the same thing happens when you
[01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:07.080]  take a drug to shut down a symptom be that symptom inflammation that shows up as arthritis or
[01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:13.400]  hypersecretion of cholesterol that shows up as cholesterol plaques whatever it is if you're
[01:40:13.400 --> 01:40:18.680]  shutting down a system in the body so you mask the symptom you are shortening your life accelerating
[01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:24.040]  and accelerating your demise it is crazy especially in light of the fact that almost all diseases if
[01:40:24.040 --> 01:40:29.160]  you backtrack them far enough you will find either a defect in nutrition or a defect in the
[01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:34.760]  absorption of nutrients from the gi system from the digestive system and this is the core of all
[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:39.800]  health and wellness and the core of all disease nutrition and the digestive system well i know
[01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:45.560]  mainline medical science for hundreds of years knew that vitamin c was literally integral to
[01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:52.120]  everything and i you know read stuff 80 years ago where where dermatologists told women if you
[01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:57.880]  want to have young skin you know eat lots of things containing vitamin c but now they don't
[01:40:57.880 --> 01:41:03.400]  tell women that they tell them have surgery again another example just looking at minerals vitamins
[01:41:03.400 --> 01:41:09.240]  nutrients because that's one of your big areas of research that deal with the skin the biggest organ
[01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:14.520]  in the body what are things that we know that supercharge the skin well i'll tell you skincare is
[01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:18.520]  my is really my business it's my passion of my love and i lecture around the country specifically
[01:41:18.520 --> 01:41:22.360]  talking about skincare and i formulated many skincare products over the last 30 years and
[01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:25.880]  let me tell you something i don't like the question where people say what's the one thing i could do
[01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:29.400]  for my skin but i'll tell you if i had to tell you one thing you could do for your skin it's
[01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:34.200]  probably the single most critical nutritional deficiency that we have in this country and that
[01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:39.400]  is around fats and essential fatty acids now when you don't have fats in your body you will shut
[01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:44.360]  your skin will show up as dry and let alex how many people do you know have dry skin i'm gonna
[01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:50.040]  stop here right now there are all these women in my neighborhood 35 40 years old who are super skinny
[01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:57.000]  who are into being you know skinny but they look like shriveled um mummies and i tell my wife when
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:01.880]  when she starts losing too much weight i say honey i like a little little plumpness i mean because
[01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:06.680]  that she looks young and vibrant and voluptuous but they've sold us that it's so beautiful to be
[01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:12.360]  this little wraith but then i read about all these disorders with seizures and mainline science
[01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:17.480]  admitting you know you need more of these certain types of fats for your brain not just your skin
[01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:23.000]  well there's two there's two specific kinds of fats that are technically referred to as essential
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:27.560]  fatty acids and whenever you hear the term essential in nutrition that refers to a substance that you
[01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:33.160]  cannot make a substance that you have to get from your diet and these two fatty acids are absolutely
[01:42:33.160 --> 01:42:37.960]  critical for the production of protein number one as anti-inflammatories number two for brain
[01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:44.040]  health number three for the production of of something called master hormones which we know
[01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:49.240]  as icosinoids in the biochemical world without these essential fatty acids none of those compounds
[01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:53.800]  can be produced and the net effect is a degeneration of all your tissue and one of the first tissues
[01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:59.800]  that degenerates in the body is the skin because to the body the skin is not important or not as
[01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:04.680]  important as the heart or the lungs so when you're nutritionally deficient the first place the body
[01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:11.560]  will withdraw nutrients from is the skin so the skin becomes a window to what's happening in the body
[01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:17.000]  instantly so we can look by looking at the skin and by reading the skin by speaking the language
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:22.360]  of the skin we don't have to do biopsies we don't have to cut inside the body to be able to assess
[01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:26.360]  nutritional deficiencies and one of the worst things or one of the the most common things that
[01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:33.160]  we see in the skin is dry skin well let me tell you something alex human skin should never be dry
[01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:37.880]  human skin should never be dry there are there are sponges inside your skin we call them the
[01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:43.560]  natural moisture factor there are molecular compounds that trap water if you have dry skin you
[01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:48.840]  have a biochemical deficiency that is shortening your life it is not cosmetic and superficial
[01:43:48.840 --> 01:43:53.320]  to take care of your skin to take care of your skin from a nutritional basis is to feed the
[01:43:53.320 --> 01:43:58.600]  inside of your body because if you see something happening on your skin rest assured it's happening
[01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:05.160]  on the inside of your body use we can use the skin as a barometer to what's happening inside the
[01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:09.400]  body on a nutritional basis and that's how we want to treat skin issues that's the number one thing
[01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:16.440]  i've learned from being a skincare professional which i am as well as being a pharmacist again
[01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:21.000]  you host this show sundays and i've done a lot of research because i'm trying to get into a real
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:25.720]  health kick not just exercising but you know under all the stress i deal with you're trying to get
[01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:30.360]  the right minerals in the last three weeks i've been doing this with my wife and she's a lot more
[01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:38.360]  into health than i am and she just absolutely loves the products from young javity the tangy
[01:44:38.360 --> 01:44:44.120]  tangerine beyond tangy tangerine but also the pollen burst she's taking it all she that that's
[01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:48.360]  her favorite uh before she works out with all those minerals and vitamins and all of the
[01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:53.240]  trace elements that are in there and one reason i've got you here today is because i've done a
[01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:58.600]  lot of research uh you know when i promote a gold company i do research when i promote a
[01:44:58.600 --> 01:45:03.320]  storable foods company i do research it's what i buy from it's what i believe in and that's why
[01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:11.640]  we've set up uh the info wars team dot com just info wars team dot com and you're involved in it
[01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:16.920]  dr wallach is and it's just like costco folks it's 10 bucks to sign up and you get big discounts or
[01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:21.000]  you can just buy the stuff straight out and then if you want to sign up others but that's a small
[01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:26.520]  factor in all of it uh you know to to you know basically go out there and and and share this
[01:45:26.520 --> 01:45:30.520]  information with other people but i've bought a bunch of it and i've just been giving it to family
[01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:38.040]  because i did a lot of research on wide spectrum you know really high quality mixes where i'm told
[01:45:38.040 --> 01:45:42.280]  you absorb a lot more of it when it's not a pill but it's in a mix and then it comes from natural
[01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:48.520]  sources uh you know not artificial uh or synthetic chemical sources and and uh knowing about dr
[01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:53.160]  wallach now for 15 years and the work he does with all this we have decided to really start
[01:45:53.160 --> 01:46:00.360]  promoting ungevity and folks can go to info wars team dot com and again buy the products uh or it's
[01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:05.880]  10 bucks to sign up you can sign others up and sell the products uh to others uh it's a great
[01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:10.920]  great system and in this imploding economy it's a great business for people as well uh but
[01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:16.200]  so many great products uh some of the products you promote and have developed uh are also there
[01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:23.800]  at info wars team dot com and if people will just try you know these true wide spectrum vitamins
[01:46:23.800 --> 01:46:29.480]  uh and minerals it will have such a huge effect in their life and i'm already seeing it myself my
[01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:36.120]  wife uh is already seeing it uh tell us uh dealing with minerals uh how important they are because
[01:46:36.120 --> 01:46:41.480]  you know that the government says you need 44 minerals or so but in the but but in the
[01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:45.640]  works without minerals nothing works without minerals it's the minerals act like little
[01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:48.440]  well minerals do a lot of things but one of the most important things they do with it is they
[01:46:48.440 --> 01:46:55.160]  act like little batteries minerals conduct energy alexander volta back in the uh late 18th century
[01:46:55.160 --> 01:47:01.000]  or late late 18th century came up with this idea where he he noticed that it that minerals
[01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:05.720]  had produced something called a voltage it was a they called an electric car electrical current
[01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:10.920]  but they named it after alexander volta your body is an electrical system and it conducts energy
[01:47:10.920 --> 01:47:15.560]  at different frequencies and each one of these minerals acts as a frequency modulator remember
[01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:19.880]  back in the old days we stopped crystal radios where you just turn the crystal and different
[01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:24.440]  frequencies would come in through the crystal radio well the body is much the same way so
[01:47:24.440 --> 01:47:28.920]  many people think of minerals as part of the structural component of the body and indeed
[01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:34.520]  your body's uh must skeletal system is composed of minerals but really minerals function in a
[01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:40.280]  much more fundamental fashion and that is in a an electrochemical fashion no vitamins work
[01:47:40.280 --> 01:47:44.760]  without minerals vitamins all have a little battery associated with them and that uh
[01:47:44.760 --> 01:47:49.800]  battery can be considered a mineral now minerals can't be you can't just get minerals from from
[01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:54.040]  eating rocks rocks or minerals but you're not going to get any nutritional value out of rocks but
[01:47:54.040 --> 01:47:58.520]  plants have evolved an ability to take those rocks from the earth and convert them into
[01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:04.040]  an electrically active usable form so the way you want to get your minerals is in plant form
[01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:08.600]  now eating vegetables is a great way to get your minerals into in an activated form but
[01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:14.360]  millions of years ago there were swamps all over this part of the country out west here
[01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:20.200]  and as the swamps died they the organic material decayed and what was left with these activated
[01:48:20.200 --> 01:48:26.040]  minerals which have remained with us as mines and by scooping out these minerals out of mines you
[01:48:26.040 --> 01:48:31.400]  can actually put them in water and because they're electrically active they will suspend in the water
[01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:35.880]  minerals will if they're not electrically active will sink in water they don't float or suspend
[01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:39.800]  but when they're electrically electrically active they form something called a colloidal
[01:48:39.800 --> 01:48:43.800]  suspension and a colloidal suspension of minerals is nothing more than minerals that are actually
[01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:49.000]  hanging in the water via electromagnetic interactions with the water when you drink
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:54.680]  those minerals you get those electrically activated substances into your body and into
[01:48:54.680 --> 01:48:59.400]  your cells in an absorbable so you're able to absorb it what's your view what's your view of
[01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:04.520]  colloidal silver because i know the same idea same idea silver if you try to do just plain old
[01:49:04.520 --> 01:49:09.320]  silver you would die because silver is a can't be handled by the body but in the colloidal format
[01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:15.080]  it becomes non-toxic so it's the same idea when minerals are suspended in the colloidal format
[01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:20.680]  they become non-toxic and they become absorbable and usable by the body now now i heard that described
[01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:25.800]  by my dad when he went to ut and then baler because he's like i was saying dad i bought this stuff at
[01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:31.800]  Whole Foods this this super you know a mineral bottle and they told me at the place that it's
[01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:36.920]  the best at Whole Foods and i said but why does it say it has trace mercury and arsenic but but
[01:49:36.920 --> 01:49:42.120]  then mercury and arsenic's bad he said well i learned in school that it's a a different variant
[01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:47.320]  of it and you have to have tiny trace amounts of that stuff mixed with the other minerals to have
[01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:53.320]  it be able to be activated that's different than pure mercury you know injected into you
[01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:58.840]  past the blood brain barrier not going through the stomach that's why the japanese live longer
[01:49:58.840 --> 01:50:02.760]  statistically than anybody else they have the highest you know diet and mercury of anybody
[01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:06.840]  that's because it's a different type because it's somehow and again i'm going off what scientists
[01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:13.320]  have said i don't understand this myself connected into the tuna fish flesh itself so you pass it
[01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:19.080]  through you and it only helps upload the other minerals and vitamins but if it's uh another
[01:50:19.080 --> 01:50:23.240]  type the type that they're injecting you the thomerosal it's completely different is that
[01:50:23.240 --> 01:50:27.560]  correct that completely different form it's not like a mineral is a mineral is a mineral there
[01:50:27.560 --> 01:50:32.840]  are many different forms of minerals when minerals are suspended in a colloidal liquid
[01:50:32.840 --> 01:50:37.160]  they become active and they become usable and they become non-toxic this is the gift the plants
[01:50:37.160 --> 01:50:43.480]  have given us is they've activated and they detoxified these substances incredible well
[01:50:43.480 --> 01:50:47.960]  folks we hope you uh check out the fine line of products and also your purchase of them supports
[01:50:47.960 --> 01:50:52.440]  this broadcast what we're doing uh but i believe in these products i've researched them i've looked
[01:50:52.440 --> 01:50:58.360]  into them a wide range of them available on the longevity line uh at info wars team dot com will

[01:53:58.920 --> 01:54:12.040]  dot com i want to keep you into the next segment with us then bob chatman's going to be joining
[01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:16.920]  us on the economy in egypt and a lot more with his uh friday visit he does every friday with us
[01:54:17.960 --> 01:54:24.040]  but pharmacist ben fuchs is joining us the system knows we have mineral and vitamin deficiencies
[01:54:24.040 --> 01:54:30.120]  they know that we have trace element deficiencies because from the research i've done and correct
[01:54:30.120 --> 01:54:35.880]  me if i'm wrong it's important to have that in those 90 plus minerals and then all the other
[01:54:35.880 --> 01:54:41.880]  vitamins for them all to work together because if you don't have them uh then the other vitamins
[01:54:41.880 --> 01:54:49.160]  and minerals are unable to be uh basically fully used uh by the body and uh after you talk about
[01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:55.160]  that i mean give us your breakdown as a pharmacist your take on the beyond tangy tangerine uh that
[01:54:55.160 --> 01:54:59.880]  we've got at info wars team dot com because again i've scoured to find the best products that i
[01:54:59.880 --> 01:55:04.520]  believe in have done the research on but i want your view on it uh on the pollen burst uh because
[01:55:04.520 --> 01:55:10.360]  my wife uh is uh she doesn't have a placebo effect i mean she kind of looks down her nose at things
[01:55:10.360 --> 01:55:15.480]  until she really sees the effect and she likes the pollen burst the best uh but i mean break that down
[01:55:15.480 --> 01:55:19.640]  am i correct in describing how all these things work synergistically together let me tell you
[01:55:19.640 --> 01:55:24.200]  a couple things first of all the cool thing about nutritional supplementation is the more deficient
[01:55:24.200 --> 01:55:32.040]  you are the faster you notice results because the body is in a vacuum state and nature abhors a vacuum
[01:55:32.040 --> 01:55:37.560]  so if you are deficient in any nutrients as soon as you start a supplement program you notice results
[01:55:37.560 --> 01:55:42.120]  right away and you cannot by right away i'm talking within hours you will notice results
[01:55:42.120 --> 01:55:47.000]  and if you have a deficiency disease if you have something like diabetes or hypertension and you
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:53.240]  start a nutritional program your markers of your health markers will change so rapidly that you
[01:55:53.240 --> 01:55:58.760]  better tell your doctor or you you may run into a problem with your medications being too active
[01:55:58.760 --> 01:56:04.600]  that's how fast you notice results when the body's in deficiency state it absorbs nutrients rapidly
[01:56:04.600 --> 01:56:10.760]  so this stuff proves itself it will prove itself to you within hours or within days now as far as
[01:56:10.760 --> 01:56:14.600]  these the synergistic nature of nutritional supplements you're absolutely correct alex no
[01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:19.640]  matter how good your baseball team is if you don't have a third baseman you're not going to win very
[01:56:19.640 --> 01:56:24.920]  many games you can have all eight all eight other positions filled with all stars but if you're
[01:56:24.920 --> 01:56:29.960]  missing one position you're not going to win many games and nutrients work the same way even though
[01:56:29.960 --> 01:56:34.120]  we like to break them down and i'm guilty of this myself because of the fascinating nature of each
[01:56:34.120 --> 01:56:39.960]  one of these substances you have to take a complete nutritional supplement program not
[01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:44.520]  individual nutrients that's one of the reasons why i like the longevity product so well is because
[01:56:44.520 --> 01:56:49.960]  they allow you to get on a program and nothing exemplifies this the synergy in this the program
[01:56:49.960 --> 01:56:55.080]  nature of the supplements better than the beyond tangy tangerine because it has everything and not
[01:56:55.080 --> 01:57:00.520]  only does it have everything it has everything in a liquid format it's actually a powder that you
[01:57:00.520 --> 01:57:04.360]  put in water but then you drink it and one of the first things we learn in pharmacy school
[01:57:04.360 --> 01:57:09.800]  is it's not the medicine that you take it's how well you absorb it and the fastest way to absorb
[01:57:09.800 --> 01:57:16.120]  a nutrient that's not intravenous or intramuscular is through a liquid solution that you drink
[01:57:16.120 --> 01:57:21.560]  because with pills no matter how good the pill is you don't absorb a lot of it but when it's
[01:57:21.560 --> 01:57:27.160]  liquid you absorb almost all of it i mean that's just you know bottom line common sense common sense
[01:57:27.160 --> 01:57:32.360]  right if you want to maximize your absorption of anything you want to put it in a liquid format
[01:57:32.360 --> 01:57:36.040]  the beyond tangy tangerine as well as a lot of the other products by the way and this is another
[01:57:36.040 --> 01:57:42.600]  one of the the the brilliant touches of dr wallick is he understood that it's the format of the
[01:57:42.600 --> 01:57:48.200]  supplement that's why you have liquid so i'm a busy guy and and and and you know i was in great
[01:57:48.200 --> 01:57:53.640]  shape 10 12 years ago quit working out got totally out of shape i've lost 25 pounds last year now i
[01:57:53.640 --> 01:57:58.600]  want to lose another 30 and really get in shape and just doing my research for it i was jogging
[01:57:58.600 --> 01:58:03.880]  lifting its nutrition even though i don't eat a lot of junk food i just i wasn't getting a lot of
[01:58:03.880 --> 01:58:08.360]  the things i needed them and i am feeling the difference but it's common sense if i can take
[01:58:09.160 --> 01:58:14.040]  one pack at the taste grade dump it in my purified water and drink it that's something
[01:58:14.040 --> 01:58:17.960]  i could do and that's something my children will do but if i tried to take all of this as
[01:58:17.960 --> 01:58:23.160]  vitamins and minerals it'd be a big you know you'll pile of them every day folks the websites

[02:00:30.600 --> 02:00:36.280]  developments in egypt bob chetman's take on the power outages all over the u.s. admittedly caused
[02:00:36.280 --> 02:00:41.000]  by the federal government blocking the building of new power plants but pharmacist ben fuchs
[02:00:41.720 --> 02:00:45.800]  joins us i've heard his show impressed with his research at a chance to meet him when he flew out
[02:00:45.800 --> 02:00:50.120]  to hear me speak and santa cruz uh a few months ago and that's why when i met him at the time i
[02:00:50.120 --> 02:00:57.480]  I wanted to get him on the show because I've done some research into his work and I believe
[02:00:57.480 --> 02:01:03.760]  in promoting things that I think are good and that also support our broadcast and what
[02:01:03.760 --> 02:01:04.760]  we're doing.
[02:01:04.760 --> 02:01:08.440]  And that's what infowarsteam.com is doing and it's pretty much like Costco.
[02:01:08.440 --> 02:01:13.560]  You pay 10 bucks if you want to get the discounts on the products or you can just buy the products
[02:01:13.560 --> 02:01:17.840]  and then once you've signed up, you can also sign up others as you sell it to your neighbors,
[02:01:17.840 --> 02:01:22.280]  friends, family, or do like I'm doing, just giving it to friends and family.
[02:01:22.280 --> 02:01:25.720]  But my children love the beyond Tangy Tang terrain.
[02:01:25.720 --> 02:01:27.840]  My wife's also taken the pollen burst.
[02:01:27.840 --> 02:01:31.520]  They got a lot of other great products that we're promoting at infowarsteam.com.
[02:01:31.520 --> 02:01:39.200]  But in the four minutes we've got left, Ben, getting into just other confirmed examples
[02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:44.840]  of deficiencies that we know are causing major diseases for people out there listening
[02:01:44.840 --> 02:01:46.560]  that their doctor hasn't told them.
[02:01:46.560 --> 02:01:50.760]  And hey, if they take the vitamins or minerals in it, doesn't help them, I doubt that it
[02:01:50.760 --> 02:01:51.760]  wouldn't.
[02:01:51.760 --> 02:01:54.080]  You know, they're out, you know, nothing but having some vitamins in their body that
[02:01:54.080 --> 02:01:56.200]  certainly helped them at some level.
[02:01:56.200 --> 02:01:57.200]  Why not?
[02:01:57.200 --> 02:02:01.200]  Why aren't the medical profession, you know, I mean, I've seen studies about how unhealthy
[02:02:01.200 --> 02:02:06.520]  hospital food is amongst some of the worst, you know, in the, in the world.
[02:02:06.520 --> 02:02:08.600]  Our body is made up of what we eat.
[02:02:08.600 --> 02:02:13.280]  Let me tell you one of the most insidious nutritional deficiencies that we've got going.
[02:02:13.280 --> 02:02:18.000]  And that is the B vitamins and heart as they regard heart disease.
[02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:24.360]  Simply three B vitamins can eliminate large numbers of heart problems.
[02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:28.520]  And Dr. Kilmer McCully, who was a physician from Harvard said this in the 1950s, there's
[02:02:28.520 --> 02:02:34.560]  a compound in the body called Homo cysteine that unlike cholesterol has been definitively
[02:02:34.560 --> 02:02:37.320]  linked to cardiovascular disease.
[02:02:37.320 --> 02:02:42.080]  This may come as a surprise to some of your listeners, but to this day, elevated cholesterol
[02:02:42.080 --> 02:02:45.720]  has not been definitively connected to heart disease.
[02:02:45.720 --> 02:02:49.280]  And despite that fact, some of the most toxic drugs on the planet, the statin drugs are
[02:02:49.280 --> 02:02:50.960]  being dispensed like candy.
[02:02:50.960 --> 02:02:56.560]  Well, unlike cholesterol, three B vitamins or deficiencies and three B vitamins has been
[02:02:56.560 --> 02:03:02.720]  linked to heart disease via the toxic chemical Homo cysteine, and that's vitamin B6, B12,
[02:03:02.720 --> 02:03:03.720]  and folic acid.
[02:03:03.720 --> 02:03:04.720]  Well, that makes sense.
[02:03:04.720 --> 02:03:08.360]  Everybody knows muscles need that and auto immune systems need that.
[02:03:08.360 --> 02:03:12.800]  And that's why they know in dentistry that if you have dirty gums, that that's where
[02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:16.400]  a lot of the infections get in and actually cause you to then get an infection in the
[02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:17.400]  ventricles.
[02:03:17.400 --> 02:03:22.480]  But I mean, what's the main causal effect of that chemical?
[02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:27.680]  I mean, there's the heart always beating from the time you're born to the time you die.
[02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:32.680]  Obviously, it's the muscle, kind of like your calf cramping up if you don't have enough
[02:03:32.680 --> 02:03:35.800]  of the stuff that's in bananas.
[02:03:35.800 --> 02:03:39.800]  Well, if you don't take those three B vitamins, if you don't have enough B vitamins, which
[02:03:39.800 --> 02:03:44.120]  unless you're supplementing, it's very difficult to get because B vitamins are depleted by processing.
[02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:48.280]  If you don't have those B vitamins in your diet or somehow getting them into your system,
[02:03:48.280 --> 02:03:51.520]  you are playing with fire, especially as it regards the heart.
[02:03:51.520 --> 02:03:56.200]  But the problem is, Alex, you can't make any money on the B vitamins.
[02:03:56.200 --> 02:03:57.840]  The B vitamins are cheap.
[02:03:57.840 --> 02:04:00.080]  They're cheap to produce and they're cheap to take.
[02:04:00.080 --> 02:04:03.760]  In fact, the young Jebedee products are packed full of it, correct?
[02:04:03.760 --> 02:04:04.760]  Packed full of it.
[02:04:04.760 --> 02:04:07.720]  One of my favorite things about the B vitamins or about the young Jebedee products is not
[02:04:07.720 --> 02:04:11.920]  only they're packed with the B vitamins, but the B vitamins need to be taken with liquids.
[02:04:11.920 --> 02:04:15.680]  And if you take the B-ontane tangerine or you take the ultimate classic, you're getting
[02:04:15.680 --> 02:04:17.320]  them in liquid format.
[02:04:17.320 --> 02:04:20.800]  The B vitamins are also excreted readily from the body.
[02:04:20.800 --> 02:04:25.360]  So not only does that make them non-toxic, but it makes it vitally important that you're
[02:04:25.360 --> 02:04:28.800]  continuously saturating your tissue.
[02:04:28.800 --> 02:04:33.000]  And in closing, I'm now hearing Dr. D. Nadell and others demonizing B vitamins like they're
[02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:34.000]  bad.
[02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:39.760]  If I ever hear Dr. D. Nadell demonizing B vitamins, I will personally fly out to his
[02:04:39.760 --> 02:04:42.800]  studio in California and rip him a new one.
[02:04:42.800 --> 02:04:44.880]  Oh, I hear it all over the news.
[02:04:44.880 --> 02:04:47.720]  I hear, there's all this talk about B vitamins, how great they are.
[02:04:47.720 --> 02:04:48.720]  It's ridiculous.
[02:04:48.720 --> 02:04:50.080]  That's a terrible, terrible thing.
[02:04:50.080 --> 02:04:53.000]  The B vitamins are vital for health and most people don't get anywhere near enough.
[02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.160]  Get all those young Jebedee products.
[02:04:55.160 --> 02:04:56.480]  That's the best advice I can give you.
[02:04:56.480 --> 02:04:58.920]  Infowarsteam.com, folks get involved.

[02:06:00.800 --> 02:06:04.360]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[02:06:04.360 --> 02:06:06.560]  It ended on June of 2009.
[02:06:06.560 --> 02:06:10.040]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:06:10.040 --> 02:06:13.840]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest
[02:06:13.840 --> 02:06:15.960]  of us, things seemed to be getting worse.
[02:06:15.960 --> 02:06:18.160]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.

[02:07:34.240 --> 02:07:54.320]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family, not worried about them moving

[02:08:16.320 --> 02:08:29.200]  Okay, we're eight minutes into a third hour on this live Friday edition.
[02:08:29.200 --> 02:08:36.160]  I think one of the biggest stories going right now is not just Egypt, but more and more admissions
[02:08:36.160 --> 02:08:39.680]  that the world economy is sliding into depression.
[02:08:39.680 --> 02:08:46.080]  I had Nomi Prens, former Goldman Sachs managing director on yesterday, talking about the fact
[02:08:46.080 --> 02:08:49.440]  that from all the evidence, she believes we're in a global depression.
[02:08:49.440 --> 02:08:54.520]  On top of all of this, the Drudge Report is linked up at the top of drudgerport.com to
[02:08:54.520 --> 02:09:00.800]  our article, Obama's blocking of new power plants, triggers nationwide blackouts, fury
[02:09:00.800 --> 02:09:08.960]  as hospitals hit with outages while post-industrial collapse of America accelerates, and there's
[02:09:08.960 --> 02:09:14.600]  a new article out, Fury builds over blackouts caused by deindustrialization of America.
[02:09:14.600 --> 02:09:20.080]  This is what Bob Chapman, formerly with military intelligence, at a time the biggest private
[02:09:20.080 --> 02:09:25.600]  silver and gold broker, biggest newsletter until he retired a decade or so ago, and
[02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:30.720]  he's been back fighting harder than ever, exposing the globalist, predicting what would
[02:09:30.720 --> 02:09:35.840]  happen in Greece and Ireland and then Spain and then here, just amazing information always
[02:09:35.840 --> 02:09:36.840]  from Bob.
[02:09:36.840 --> 02:09:41.760]  But Bob always talks about the SEC allowing Bernie Madoff, Ken Lay, all these crooks to
[02:09:41.760 --> 02:09:44.880]  run wild, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan.
[02:09:44.880 --> 02:09:49.760]  He always talks about how big government is about the insiders being able to engage in
[02:09:49.760 --> 02:09:54.200]  business and shutting down their competition, and what an incredible example in the last
[02:09:54.200 --> 02:09:59.680]  three months, Obama issuing more than 500 waivers, the first to McDonald's with its
[02:09:59.680 --> 02:10:03.000]  hundreds of thousands of employees, where they don't have to get insurance for their
[02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:08.240]  employees, but their competition, the hamburger joint next door owned by Sally Sockerman or
[02:10:08.240 --> 02:10:09.640]  Joe Sixpack, they do.
[02:10:09.640 --> 02:10:15.880]  Well, now another huge example of that that has been in the news is they're now making
[02:10:15.880 --> 02:10:23.520]  it secret small business filings for federal contracts in the U.S., and it turns out they
[02:10:23.520 --> 02:10:28.240]  have a secret blacklisting where they're only basically giving it to mega corporations,
[02:10:28.240 --> 02:10:29.240]  completely illegal.
[02:10:29.240 --> 02:10:35.000]  Congress is starting investigations on both of those, but the big fat cherry on top is
[02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:42.360]  three days ago, this is reported on by the Washington Examiner and Reuters, Obama gave
[02:10:42.360 --> 02:10:47.240]  a waiver to General Electric, the biggest builder of cold powered plants in the world,
[02:10:47.240 --> 02:10:52.600]  and also one of the biggest operators, they gave General Electric a waiver.
[02:10:52.600 --> 02:10:56.560]  They don't have to put in all these new carbon taxes, and then in Paul Watson's article,
[02:10:56.560 --> 02:11:06.400]  it details Georgia, it details Texas, Kansas, South Dakota, just in the last year, all of
[02:11:06.400 --> 02:11:10.760]  these power plants that were already operating shut down, power plants, this is outside of
[02:11:10.760 --> 02:11:14.800]  law, they don't have any new law to do this, Congress didn't pass the Kyoto Protocol,
[02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:19.280]  and now they're blocking the opening of a 3.2 billion dollar clean cold powered plant
[02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:20.280]  in Corpus Christi.
[02:11:20.280 --> 02:11:26.160]  So we're having rolling blackouts all over the nation, California, North Carolina, Texas,
[02:11:26.160 --> 02:11:31.040]  are off, I mean this is getting insane, we're having to get our power from Mexico, where
[02:11:31.040 --> 02:11:36.680]  General Electric's got plants that aren't under the controls, I mean this is amazing
[02:11:36.680 --> 02:11:40.720]  to see this happening, Bob Chapman, your take on it.
[02:11:40.720 --> 02:11:48.080]  I think it's very typical of what you see in a corporatist fascist society, it's as
[02:11:48.080 --> 02:11:55.160]  plain as that, it's a concentration of power and control, and within industries there might
[02:11:55.160 --> 02:12:02.080]  be only two or three or four or five producers of whatever it is, whether it's a service
[02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:10.440]  or a manufactured item, or in this case power itself, and that concentration of power makes
[02:12:10.440 --> 02:12:18.640]  these large corporations that control government ever more powerful in controlling government.
[02:12:18.640 --> 02:12:25.120]  Another example is, most of you can't remember because you weren't born, but back in 1948
[02:12:25.120 --> 02:12:34.880]  well actually in 1946, they had the Nuremberg war crimes trial, and out of that came a lot
[02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:42.360]  of things, and I won't go into the gory details, but one important thing that came out, that
[02:12:42.360 --> 02:12:51.640]  Thyssen and Krupp, the two big steel companies, were supposed to be broken up and they were
[02:12:51.640 --> 02:12:57.800]  supposed to be done away with by 1948, and that never happened, and here they are setting
[02:12:57.800 --> 02:13:04.200]  up a plant, they merged since then, they're setting up a plant in the United States, now
[02:13:04.200 --> 02:13:07.600]  they're going to produce steel of course.
[02:13:07.600 --> 02:13:17.120]  Now that's another good example, these people were major, really major supporters of Adolf
[02:13:17.120 --> 02:13:24.680]  Hitler, and they've been in business ever since in spite of the edict by Nuremberg,
[02:13:24.680 --> 02:13:30.080]  and I don't know why, but they are, but this is the kind of thing that Alex is talking
[02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:37.880]  about in relation to large corporations and concentration of power.
[02:13:37.880 --> 02:13:43.320]  Now according to all historical measurements and common sense, this is illegal, this isn't
[02:13:43.320 --> 02:13:49.280]  just monopolies, and combines oligopolies forming, they're coming in and Obama has said
[02:13:49.280 --> 02:13:54.920]  I will bankrupt any new coal power plants, but that isn't really true, he'll bankrupt
[02:13:54.920 --> 02:14:01.640]  those who aren't basically financing him, who aren't allied with Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan
[02:14:01.640 --> 02:14:06.800]  and General Electric, and now you have the head of his economic council in there doling
[02:14:06.800 --> 02:14:12.800]  out the trillions of bailout money, being the former head of General Electric, one of
[02:14:12.800 --> 02:14:18.760]  his biggest campaign contributors, and now they're setting policy, and the economic council
[02:14:18.760 --> 02:14:24.960]  head instructs Obama to give total waivers to General Electric, but not their competition.
[02:14:24.960 --> 02:14:31.400]  I mean if that isn't insider criminal activity, what is Bob, I mean what do you call that
[02:14:31.400 --> 02:14:32.400]  legally?
[02:14:32.400 --> 02:14:44.280]  Crime, you know there's two acts which go back to the beginning of the 20th century,
[02:14:44.280 --> 02:14:51.960]  which handle the monopoly policies that were abundant at that time.
[02:14:51.960 --> 02:14:55.720]  Sherman antitrust and what's the other one?
[02:14:55.720 --> 02:15:01.400]  Sherman and, I forget, but anyway there's two of them, but Sherman's the most well-known
[02:15:01.400 --> 02:15:09.680]  one and the most used, and it was started because of the monopolies of the oil companies,
[02:15:09.680 --> 02:15:19.480]  but it spread, and those laws are still in the books, but if the AG's office in Washington
[02:15:19.480 --> 02:15:23.920]  doesn't want to prosecute, well they just go on their merry way doing what they're doing,
[02:15:23.920 --> 02:15:29.920]  and of course what you're talking about, instead of adjudication and investigation, you're
[02:15:29.920 --> 02:15:36.440]  talking about expansion of monopolization, instead of calling in the Sherman antitrust
[02:15:36.440 --> 02:15:37.440]  act.
[02:15:37.440 --> 02:15:42.920]  Well we saw that in 99 getting rid of the Glass-Steagall on finances, so this is not,
[02:15:42.920 --> 02:15:45.440]  they always say, leave us alone, we're free market.
[02:15:45.440 --> 02:15:49.720]  It's not free market for General Electric and Goldman Sachs to publicly lobby Obama
[02:15:49.720 --> 02:15:54.440]  to side onto Kyoto that they're on record helping right, so they can selectively use
[02:15:54.440 --> 02:15:56.840]  government to shut down all their competition.
[02:15:56.840 --> 02:16:01.640]  That is just brazen criminal racketeering.
[02:16:01.640 --> 02:16:06.360]  Well it's simpler than that, they just call up and say look, this is what we want, and
[02:16:06.360 --> 02:16:09.400]  so fix it, and that's the end of it.
[02:16:09.400 --> 02:16:13.840]  And so now my power prices in the last few years have doubled, and they bought up the
[02:16:13.840 --> 02:16:19.280]  city on power plant and shut it down, and they're creating artificial scarcity, Bob.
[02:16:19.280 --> 02:16:24.480]  That's right, and when they take over water in countries where they have before they
[02:16:24.480 --> 02:16:30.320]  do the same thing, they let the system break down, and they close one of the systems up,
[02:16:30.320 --> 02:16:34.560]  and then you only have one system to choose from, and the price of water just went from
[02:16:34.560 --> 02:16:42.480]  $20 a month to $220 a month, and they do it with everything else.
[02:16:42.480 --> 02:16:46.120]  And these toll roads that they're thinking of putting in, that they've been trying for
[02:16:46.120 --> 02:16:49.680]  years to put in now, same thing.
[02:16:49.680 --> 02:16:55.120]  The tolls will start off at $1, five years later, they'll be $15.
[02:16:55.120 --> 02:16:56.120]  It's looting.
[02:16:56.120 --> 02:17:00.080]  Well, I mean, here in the U.S., it's on record, that's why we've been defeating it so far
[02:17:00.080 --> 02:17:01.240]  in many areas.
[02:17:01.240 --> 02:17:06.960]  They openly take taxpayer money, build the roads, and then give the roads to usually
[02:17:06.960 --> 02:17:11.360]  Spanish, German, or Dutch companies for whatever reason, center of Spain and others.
[02:17:11.360 --> 02:17:17.760]  They give them the road, and then on record, the state stops fixing the old free roads,
[02:17:17.760 --> 02:17:22.400]  and then they start putting toll roads on sections of the old road to make you use the
[02:17:22.400 --> 02:17:23.400]  toll road.
[02:17:23.400 --> 02:17:26.240]  I mean, it's diabolical.
[02:17:26.240 --> 02:17:32.360]  It certainly is, and as long as the public allows it, it's going to continue.
[02:17:32.360 --> 02:17:33.520]  It's as simple as that.
[02:17:33.520 --> 02:17:40.200]  The people have got to try to do something about it, and we hoped in the last election
[02:17:40.200 --> 02:17:44.800]  that the House of the Senate incumbents would lose more seats.
[02:17:44.800 --> 02:17:49.080]  They lost 14% instead of the normal 6%.
[02:17:49.080 --> 02:17:56.240]  Are they going to throw out half the people in Congress at the next election?
[02:17:56.240 --> 02:17:57.240]  I don't know.
[02:17:57.240 --> 02:18:03.040]  I'm not optimistic because too many people just don't get it.
[02:18:03.040 --> 02:18:06.280]  They complain about the bill, but they know they got to pay it, so they say, oh, the heck
[02:18:06.280 --> 02:18:07.280]  with it.
[02:18:07.280 --> 02:18:12.400]  They forget to go to the polls and get rid of the guy who's responsible because he voted
[02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:13.400]  for it.
[02:18:13.400 --> 02:18:14.400]  Bob, so many.
[02:18:14.400 --> 02:18:21.360]  So many libertarians, and I have a libertarian view of life and believe that it is the way
[02:18:21.360 --> 02:18:26.560]  to go, but not if the people who claim they're libertarians don't understand the players.
[02:18:26.560 --> 02:18:31.840]  These mega 100 or less super corporations are bigger than most governments.
[02:18:31.840 --> 02:18:35.080]  They're taking the place of government with government power.
[02:18:35.080 --> 02:18:38.040]  They're using government power to shut down their competition.
[02:18:38.040 --> 02:18:40.200]  That's not privatization, is it?
[02:18:40.200 --> 02:18:41.200]  No.
[02:18:41.200 --> 02:18:44.160]  It's the end of sovereignty.
[02:18:44.160 --> 02:18:53.960]  And it's deliberate, not only for the additional profit, but also the control of the people.
[02:18:53.960 --> 02:18:55.800]  It goes hand in hand.
[02:18:55.800 --> 02:18:58.240]  It's very subtle.
[02:18:58.240 --> 02:19:04.320]  When Adolf Hitler came into power in 1933 with about 42% of the vote, it was split three
[02:19:04.320 --> 02:19:13.640]  ways basically, and he immediately started doing what you're seeing going on in America
[02:19:13.640 --> 02:19:16.040]  today.
[02:19:16.040 --> 02:19:18.040]  Same thing.
[02:19:18.040 --> 02:19:23.360]  He built his internment camps, we call them concentration camps, and for the people who
[02:19:23.360 --> 02:19:28.160]  didn't agree with him, and have people who had money he wanted to get rid of so we could
[02:19:28.160 --> 02:19:31.160]  take their money.
[02:19:31.160 --> 02:19:32.160]  Yeah, so many.
[02:19:32.160 --> 02:19:34.160]  This is exactly what's happening in America.
[02:19:34.160 --> 02:19:41.000]  I think what we saw in the 1930s in Italy and Germany was just a testing ground, a precursor
[02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.000]  to what we're getting today.
[02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:47.720]  We think they got their act together so it could shove it down our throats.
[02:19:47.720 --> 02:19:48.720]  I agree with you.
[02:19:48.720 --> 02:19:52.240]  I want to get into the $100 trillion the banksters want.
[02:19:52.240 --> 02:19:56.080]  They announced a few weeks ago at Davos, what you think is most important on the economic
[02:19:56.080 --> 02:20:01.800]  front, and then phone calls with Bob Chapman, stay with us.
[02:20:01.800 --> 02:20:04.800]  The food storage industry leader has done it again.
[02:20:04.800 --> 02:20:08.560]  Introducing FDG Clubs and Survival Bucks from the Freeze Dry Guy.

[02:22:00.440 --> 02:22:06.000]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important
[02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.720]  day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:22:08.720 --> 02:22:11.280]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:22:11.280 --> 02:22:15.120]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children and even how you take care of
[02:22:15.120 --> 02:22:16.720]  your health and your own family.
[02:22:16.720 --> 02:22:19.640]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:22:19.640 --> 02:22:22.000]  The crazy part is he's usually right.
[02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:26.440]  You see he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac and America's biggest small
[02:22:26.440 --> 02:22:28.240]  owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:22:28.240 --> 02:22:31.600]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:22:31.600 --> 02:22:35.720]  Recently he created a video which you can watch online for free detailing his biggest
[02:22:35.720 --> 02:22:38.920]  and most important prediction yet and it's a real eye-opener.
[02:22:38.920 --> 02:22:40.440]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:22:40.440 --> 02:22:43.080]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:22:43.080 --> 02:22:47.360]  He explains everything you need to know including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:22:47.360 --> 02:22:51.960]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:22:51.960 --> 02:22:52.960]  That's End of America.
[02:22:52.960 --> 02:22:54.600]  The number 3.com.
[02:22:54.600 --> 02:22:58.320]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:22:58.320 --> 02:23:00.200]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:23:00.200 --> 02:23:01.520]  Hi this is Alex Jones.
[02:23:01.520 --> 02:23:05.480]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage
[02:23:05.480 --> 02:23:07.120]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:23:07.120 --> 02:23:11.160]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver
[02:23:11.160 --> 02:23:12.160]  or gold?
[02:23:12.160 --> 02:23:15.520]  It's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country and it's
[02:23:15.520 --> 02:23:17.700]  possible that could even happen again.
[02:23:17.700 --> 02:23:21.840]  So our friends at Solutions From Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[02:23:21.840 --> 02:23:22.840]  seeds.
[02:23:22.840 --> 02:23:28.200]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense
[02:23:28.200 --> 02:23:30.040]  food for you and your family.
[02:23:30.040 --> 02:23:31.160]  And here's the best part.
[02:23:31.160 --> 02:23:35.360]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds
[02:23:35.360 --> 02:23:37.840]  to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:23:37.840 --> 02:23:41.080]  So visit them today at www.SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:23:41.080 --> 02:23:47.880]  That's www.SurvivalSeedBank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:23:47.880 --> 02:23:52.080]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:23:52.080 --> 02:23:56.920]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:23:56.920 --> 02:24:02.200]  This is Alex Jones for www.SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:24:02.200 --> 02:24:08.600]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones only on the GCN radio network.
[02:24:08.600 --> 02:24:14.600]  We were just having a snowball fight outside during the short break and of course I defeated
[02:24:14.600 --> 02:24:15.600]  them.
[02:24:15.600 --> 02:24:18.920]  The snuck attack, the crew, I'm sure they're going to get me back.
[02:24:18.920 --> 02:24:24.080]  Al Gore says these cold temperatures are global warming but if you'll pay him a tax
[02:24:24.080 --> 02:24:28.000]  and let him and his buddy shut down all the power plants that they don't own stock in,
[02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.720]  everything will be just fine.
[02:24:30.720 --> 02:24:35.160]  But here's to Al Gore, I'm going to throw this at the camera for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[02:24:35.160 --> 02:24:36.400]  We'll see if I can hit it.
[02:24:36.400 --> 02:24:42.040]  Here is to Al Gore and all of the global warming fraudsters.
[02:24:42.040 --> 02:24:44.040]  Here's what I think of you.
[02:24:44.040 --> 02:24:46.040]  Ha ha!
[02:24:46.040 --> 02:24:47.040]  Ha ha!
[02:24:47.040 --> 02:24:48.040]  Dead on!
[02:24:48.040 --> 02:24:51.600]  All right, pretty ridiculous, trying to have some gallows humor here.
[02:24:51.600 --> 02:24:57.080]  Bob, there's got to be a way to reverse this because the Republicans are now driving a
[02:24:57.080 --> 02:25:01.560]  move with some of the Democrats to reinstate and make the Patriot Act, which is completely
[02:25:01.560 --> 02:25:06.400]  unconstitutional and admittedly aimed at the American people, permanent.
[02:25:06.400 --> 02:25:10.680]  And sure, folks are awakening but is it fast enough because as you said, the globalists
[02:25:10.680 --> 02:25:15.000]  admit they're trying to bring in tyranny to secure all their ill-gotten gains?
[02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:23.720]  That's a hard one to call and if I had to make a book on it, I'd say the odds are even
[02:25:23.720 --> 02:25:27.360]  money that they'll win and get what they want.
[02:25:27.360 --> 02:25:34.080]  And I, you know, because of the control of the House and the Senate by the power behind
[02:25:34.080 --> 02:25:42.760]  government with money, which you've talked about so often, you have this situation where
[02:25:42.760 --> 02:25:49.400]  70% of a congressman's constituency said, we don't want that act and you vote against
[02:25:49.400 --> 02:25:50.400]  it.
[02:25:50.400 --> 02:25:53.520]  He'll do it anyway because he's going to pay to do it.
[02:25:53.520 --> 02:25:55.800]  These people aren't paying him.
[02:25:55.800 --> 02:25:59.400]  He doesn't think the salary he gets comes from them, comes from the federal government
[02:25:59.400 --> 02:26:05.480]  and then all of the campaign contributions with the payoffs and of course the lobbyists
[02:26:05.480 --> 02:26:06.720]  and so on.
[02:26:06.720 --> 02:26:14.600]  And so you're going to have a hard fight because you needed fresh blood in those two houses
[02:26:14.600 --> 02:26:18.680]  in order to neutralize the power of the people who were there.
[02:26:18.680 --> 02:26:24.280]  And I don't think you've got enough power change, we'll call it, to stop them.
[02:26:24.280 --> 02:26:28.440]  And that's why that last election was so important.
[02:26:28.440 --> 02:26:36.120]  We only can get to so many people and, you know, there's a vast amount of people in America,
[02:26:36.120 --> 02:26:42.080]  let's say 150 million adults and not everybody's listening to anything.
[02:26:42.080 --> 02:26:48.880]  And so it's very difficult and I wouldn't be surprised if it was made permanent.
[02:26:48.880 --> 02:26:52.240]  And I'm not a defeatist, just being a realist.
[02:26:52.240 --> 02:26:55.560]  Well, you've said many times you believe we're going to win, it's just going to be a hard
[02:26:55.560 --> 02:26:57.840]  road.
[02:26:57.840 --> 02:27:01.040]  And maybe that's one of the battles that will lose along the way.
[02:27:01.040 --> 02:27:07.040]  There will be others that will win, like sooner or later the manipulation of the markets
[02:27:07.040 --> 02:27:13.280]  is going to end because the physical gold and silver market are going to upset the paper
[02:27:13.280 --> 02:27:17.080]  market, which is the future, the derivatives, the options.
[02:27:17.080 --> 02:27:18.080]  It's going to blow up.
[02:27:18.080 --> 02:27:19.880]  Now Bob, I want to break that down.
[02:27:19.880 --> 02:27:20.880]  I want to break that.
[02:27:20.880 --> 02:27:21.880]  Those people are going to lose their money.
[02:27:21.880 --> 02:27:22.880]  I want to break that down.
[02:27:22.880 --> 02:27:26.040]  We come back from break and get your view on some of the more important economic developments
[02:27:26.040 --> 02:27:27.040]  we're seeing.
[02:27:27.040 --> 02:27:31.960]  We haven't talked in a week with what's happening in Egypt.
[02:27:31.960 --> 02:27:35.960]  Now our supposed government admits that they funded the rebellion.
[02:27:35.960 --> 02:27:37.120]  The rebellion was already there.
[02:27:37.120 --> 02:27:41.720]  The folks have a real reason to be mad with a 30-year dictator, Hussein Mubarak.
[02:27:41.720 --> 02:27:48.120]  But now they've brought in IMF World Bank policies that have caused food prices to go
[02:27:48.120 --> 02:27:49.120]  up.
[02:27:49.120 --> 02:27:50.920]  The people are very hungry.
[02:27:50.920 --> 02:27:55.040]  But clearly now they admit it's part of their strategy to destabilize the Middle East.
[02:27:55.040 --> 02:27:57.520]  What's your view on those developments?
[02:27:57.520 --> 02:27:58.520]  Absolutely.
[02:27:58.520 --> 02:28:00.920]  But I think there's a bigger reason.
[02:28:00.920 --> 02:28:03.120]  And I think that reason will come out later.
[02:28:03.120 --> 02:28:11.040]  And it's to deflect interest about the problems that America and Europe have financially.
[02:28:11.040 --> 02:28:15.640]  The municipal problem, I mean, how many are going to go bankrupt?
[02:28:15.640 --> 02:28:17.840]  How many are going to default in their bonds?
[02:28:17.840 --> 02:28:23.800]  Will legislation be passed to allow states to go bankrupt and wipe out the pensions and
[02:28:23.800 --> 02:28:29.360]  the benefits of the people who worked all their lives for them, or at least in part?
[02:28:29.360 --> 02:28:35.720]  And then you have the funding by the Fed of the Treasury purchases.
[02:28:35.720 --> 02:28:41.680]  They say they're going to purchase $900 billion by April or June, whichever date.
[02:28:41.680 --> 02:28:44.840]  They've said both different times.
[02:28:44.840 --> 02:28:49.640]  When I know that they started doing what they're doing last June, and I think from what Bob
[02:28:49.640 --> 02:28:56.000]  Diamond to Barkley said at Davos, they've already spent $1.7 trillion.
[02:28:56.000 --> 02:29:01.240]  And so we get coming through the pipeline, which is reaching us now, is the inflation
[02:29:01.240 --> 02:29:04.920]  caused by QE1 and stimulus.
[02:29:04.920 --> 02:29:11.440]  And now it'll be followed by the same stimulus, which will come to the economy causing inflation
[02:29:11.440 --> 02:29:18.640]  for stimulus 2, which was the tax act, which was loaded with pork, $862 billion, along
[02:29:18.640 --> 02:29:22.120]  with another set $1.7 trillion.
[02:29:22.120 --> 02:29:24.280]  And is QE3 coming behind that?
[02:29:24.280 --> 02:29:26.160]  Of course it is.
[02:29:26.160 --> 02:29:31.960]  And you mentioned earlier, Alex, at Davos, they talked about $100 trillion.
[02:29:31.960 --> 02:29:36.920]  That's $10 trillion a year.
[02:29:36.920 --> 02:29:39.400]  Bob Chapman is our guest.
[02:29:39.400 --> 02:29:42.560]  We're going to come back from break, get more into the economy, and where he sees gold
[02:29:42.560 --> 02:29:46.080]  and silver going with the manipulation that's happening and your phone calls.
[02:29:46.080 --> 02:29:47.080]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:47.080 --> 02:29:51.640]  Stay with us.
[02:29:51.640 --> 02:29:52.920]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.920 --> 02:29:55.360]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.360 --> 02:30:01.200]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:30:01.200 --> 02:30:05.880]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:05.880 --> 02:30:10.200]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:10.200 --> 02:30:14.520]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[02:30:14.520 --> 02:30:15.840]  allows you to have.
[02:30:15.840 --> 02:30:16.840]  It's true.
[02:30:16.840 --> 02:30:21.560]  The government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:21.560 --> 02:30:25.880]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:30:25.880 --> 02:30:29.880]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:29.880 --> 02:30:33.360]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:33.360 --> 02:30:37.080]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[02:30:37.080 --> 02:30:41.840]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:30:41.840 --> 02:30:45.600]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[02:30:45.600 --> 02:30:47.000]  to my oldest sponsors.
[02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:51.240]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:51.240 --> 02:30:52.760]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:52.760 --> 02:31:01.920]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:31:01.920 --> 02:31:06.200]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with
[02:31:06.200 --> 02:31:10.800]  your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function
[02:31:10.800 --> 02:31:14.640]  of the Silver Lungs system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[02:31:14.640 --> 02:31:17.320]  anywhere in or on the body.
[02:31:17.320 --> 02:31:22.080]  My name is Mario Safaldi, and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs generator.
[02:31:22.080 --> 02:31:26.680]  Not only does the Silver Lungs system produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[02:31:26.680 --> 02:31:31.320]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver
[02:31:31.320 --> 02:31:34.840]  solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:31:34.840 --> 02:31:41.640]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive
[02:31:41.640 --> 02:31:42.640]  system.
[02:31:42.640 --> 02:31:50.000]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs system at www.silverlungs.com
[02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:53.080]  to learn more about how the Silver Lungs system works.
[02:31:53.080 --> 02:31:57.080]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[02:31:57.080 --> 02:32:00.080]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:32:00.080 --> 02:32:05.080]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:32:05.080 --> 02:32:09.360]  Not detergents, but good old fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin Soap Company, a family
[02:32:09.360 --> 02:32:11.360]  owned and operated American company.
[02:32:11.360 --> 02:32:16.240]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love
[02:32:16.240 --> 02:32:18.880]  these products for bath, air, laundry, and dishes.
[02:32:18.880 --> 02:32:22.920]  There is nothing like these factory direct, big money saving triple concentrated soaps
[02:32:22.920 --> 02:32:23.920]  anywhere.
[02:32:23.920 --> 02:32:32.480]  Get a free detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[02:32:32.480 --> 02:32:36.640]  Let's talk to the owner of 5star soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[02:32:36.640 --> 02:32:43.240]  Mr. Schachter and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:32:43.240 --> 02:32:47.160]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[02:32:47.160 --> 02:32:58.400]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying a one to two month
[02:32:58.400 --> 02:32:59.400]  soap sampler.
[02:32:59.400 --> 02:33:00.400]  Thank you.
[02:33:00.400 --> 02:33:09.400]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[02:33:09.400 --> 02:33:17.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:17.400 --> 02:33:18.400]  Bob Chapman is our guest.
[02:33:18.400 --> 02:33:22.400]  We're going to be taking your calls at 800-599-231-800-2599.
[02:33:22.400 --> 02:33:28.800]  92-31 will get you up and on the air.
[02:33:28.800 --> 02:33:36.080]  Bob, you were trying to get into the economy when the break cut us off, but clearly the
[02:33:36.080 --> 02:33:38.840]  depression is intensifying.
[02:33:38.840 --> 02:33:44.280]  Give us your current analysis and your forecast on what's coming up and what you think is
[02:33:44.280 --> 02:33:46.920]  most important in the economy right now.
[02:33:46.920 --> 02:33:53.640]  Well, two years ago, I said that we were in an inflationary depression and the lady that
[02:33:53.640 --> 02:33:58.520]  you had on said essentially the same thing, and it's the first person I've ever heard
[02:33:58.520 --> 02:34:04.160]  in the last two years that said that, but what we've had is people keep on calling it
[02:34:04.160 --> 02:34:05.160]  a recession.
[02:34:05.160 --> 02:34:06.160]  It's not that.
[02:34:06.160 --> 02:34:10.280]  It's just that we have more inflation than deflation, and that's what's holding things
[02:34:10.280 --> 02:34:14.480]  up for the moment, and that's not going to last forever.
[02:34:14.480 --> 02:34:19.080]  I mentioned the three problems, the third one being in Europe, and that's going to manifest
[02:34:19.080 --> 02:34:21.240]  itself before the year is out.
[02:34:21.240 --> 02:34:27.280]  I did see that over the last few weeks, the Chinese and Japanese who are their own set
[02:34:27.280 --> 02:34:35.240]  of problems have galloped in with US Treasuries, and they have purchased Euro bonds from those
[02:34:35.240 --> 02:34:41.880]  countries that are in trouble, giving a respite to Germany and all the other solvent companies
[02:34:41.880 --> 02:34:46.640]  in the countries in the Eurozone, but that's not going to be permanent.
[02:34:46.640 --> 02:34:50.880]  There's a whole bunch of reasons why that's happening, but we're still going to have this
[02:34:50.880 --> 02:34:55.520]  manifestation of three different problems coming together in the second half of the
[02:34:55.520 --> 02:34:56.520]  year.
[02:34:56.520 --> 02:35:05.280]  GDP growth is only going to be 2% to 2.25% in spite of another $2.5 trillion being spent
[02:35:05.280 --> 02:35:11.560]  by a combination of the Fed and the administration, and they'll probably do it over again.
[02:35:11.560 --> 02:35:19.200]  As I said earlier, they're trying to draft proposals on this $100 trillion, $10 trillion
[02:35:19.200 --> 02:35:24.280]  a year for 10 years, to flood the world with all kinds of currencies.
[02:35:24.280 --> 02:35:29.680]  They expect this thing to go on and on and on, and I don't think they can keep it going
[02:35:29.680 --> 02:35:35.840]  because what it's going to lead to in almost every currency is hyperinflation, and that's
[02:35:35.840 --> 02:35:41.600]  when you have inflation, but the value of your money is decreasing and purchasing power
[02:35:41.600 --> 02:35:47.280]  so quickly that you've got to get rid of it, and so you go out and buy anything, usually
[02:35:47.280 --> 02:35:53.800]  food and clothing, so that you'll have something for your money rather than lose it because
[02:35:53.800 --> 02:36:00.800]  so much of it's been printed, and this is the direction that we're headed in.
[02:36:00.800 --> 02:36:07.480]  Bob, it's like we're in a school bus driving towards a cliff, and we can see the cliff
[02:36:07.480 --> 02:36:11.200]  and we know what's going to happen, and we want to get off the bus, but the bus driver
[02:36:11.200 --> 02:36:19.160]  is basically asleep, and we're just here desperately trying to shake the American people awake,
[02:36:19.160 --> 02:36:24.600]  or it's more like much of the bus is asleep, the passengers, and a madman is driving the
[02:36:24.600 --> 02:36:30.280]  bus, and so bottom line, we're in a race against time to expose the globalists and that they
[02:36:30.280 --> 02:36:36.120]  are the authors of much of our misery, or they're going to get away with what they have
[02:36:36.120 --> 02:36:43.200]  set up and what is unfolding, I mean how long can they keep the hoax going that the recession
[02:36:43.200 --> 02:36:50.200]  ended in June of 2009?
[02:36:50.200 --> 02:36:53.880]  Well Paul Craig, Craig Roberts and I said the same thing on your program a long time
[02:36:53.880 --> 02:36:59.000]  ago, and they will continue to do what they're doing as long as they can, because they have
[02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:03.760]  no exit, there's no way for them to get out of the box, they're trapped, and they're
[02:37:03.760 --> 02:37:09.440]  going to have to bring this thing to the conclusion that they want, and whether that conclusion
[02:37:09.440 --> 02:37:13.920]  will stick or not remains to be seen, I don't think it will, because you and I and others
[02:37:13.920 --> 02:37:19.680]  like us are doing what we're doing on talk radio and on the internet, and so they're
[02:37:19.680 --> 02:37:24.080]  continuing to do what they're doing, when will the dollar blow up, when will we have
[02:37:24.080 --> 02:37:30.560]  a crisis, I don't know, but I do know it's coming, but you can't put a date on it, it's
[02:37:30.560 --> 02:37:35.880]  not going to happen as quickly as even I thought, you know when we talked about this before
[02:37:35.880 --> 02:37:42.680]  Alex, it was two years ago, and you were thinking in six months, and Mr. Roberts and I were
[02:37:42.680 --> 02:37:47.040]  thinking in terms of a year and a half to two years, we were already there, and we were
[02:37:47.040 --> 02:37:53.240]  both wrong, so they have a lot of longevity out there, you've got to play the game, and
[02:37:53.240 --> 02:37:58.560]  how you do that, if you have wealth, if you have money, is to buy gold and silver related
[02:37:58.560 --> 02:38:02.520]  assets, because it's the safest place for you to be.
[02:38:02.520 --> 02:38:08.880]  All to be clear, going back to 2008 and October and open talk of war on the streets and the
[02:38:08.880 --> 02:38:14.160]  financial terrorist holding Congress hostage and threatening total collapse, if they didn't
[02:38:14.160 --> 02:38:19.120]  write them a blank check, I was just, you know, seeing what they were doing and saying
[02:38:19.120 --> 02:38:25.040]  it looks like they're gearing up or something, but basically they just ignore the depression,
[02:38:25.040 --> 02:38:29.600]  they ignore people losing their jobs, they just keep saying everything's fine, everything's
[02:38:29.600 --> 02:38:35.760]  wonderful as the world revolves, as this global depression unfolds, and it looks like Western
[02:38:35.760 --> 02:38:40.440]  Europe and the United States will go last, but undoubtedly, you look at the mathematics,
[02:38:40.440 --> 02:38:44.320]  there's no way to get out of this derivatives black hole, even if we give the banksters
[02:38:44.320 --> 02:38:49.720]  100 trillion more of tax money, and they leverage it with fractional reserve banking
[02:38:49.720 --> 02:38:55.960]  out to 1,000 trillion or 1 quadrillion, I mean, could that possibly fix things, but
[02:38:55.960 --> 02:38:57.680]  the bankers don't want to fix it.
[02:38:57.680 --> 02:39:00.680]  This is a global consolidation move.
[02:39:00.680 --> 02:39:07.280]  Well, you've asked two questions and you essentially have answered them, and that is, they'll take
[02:39:07.280 --> 02:39:11.640]  it out as far as they think they can and get away with it, and they've done this over and
[02:39:11.640 --> 02:39:16.320]  over again, so they know what to expect, they know the different ways that things could
[02:39:16.320 --> 02:39:22.320]  go, and they prepared for that, yes, they do not care one little bit about any people
[02:39:22.320 --> 02:39:27.600]  anywhere, reflecting back, they want to get rid of 60 to 80% of the people in the world.
[02:39:27.600 --> 02:39:31.840]  You've said it a hundred times that I've heard you, and that's a reflection of what
[02:39:31.840 --> 02:39:38.760]  the CFR and the Trilats and the Bilderbergers have said at their meetings as well as in
[02:39:38.760 --> 02:39:45.960]  their writings, and so, no, they don't care about people, not at all, the destabilization
[02:39:45.960 --> 02:39:50.200]  is going on in the Middle East, what's going to happen, they're going to replace people
[02:39:50.200 --> 02:39:58.640]  by, like Mubarak, but somebody else that they control, but they got there, the thing that
[02:39:58.640 --> 02:40:04.880]  they wanted, which was to get people looking at the Middle East demonstrations and riots
[02:40:04.880 --> 02:40:11.600]  and take their mind off of the basic and fundamental economic and financial problems that Western
[02:40:11.600 --> 02:40:16.440]  Europe and the United States have, that's what it was really all about, destabilization
[02:40:16.440 --> 02:40:23.880]  comes second, and how far will it go, will it destabilize Yemen and Jordan and maybe
[02:40:23.880 --> 02:40:31.840]  even Libya or Syria or, we don't know, but I don't think it's going to go too far because
[02:40:31.840 --> 02:40:38.680]  I think they've made a mistake, and the big mistake was the reaction of the people in
[02:40:38.680 --> 02:40:47.440]  the street, not so much in Tunisia, but in Egypt, they were not there to start a fight
[02:40:47.440 --> 02:40:54.240]  with the police or with the military, they got along just fine until Mubarak's goons
[02:40:54.240 --> 02:41:01.360]  came at the best of Bill Clinton, and they started beating people up and throwing fire
[02:41:01.360 --> 02:41:07.320]  bombs and so on, but everybody knows what they're doing, so Mubarak has done the wrong
[02:41:07.320 --> 02:41:10.480]  thing, he screwed, he's out.
[02:41:10.480 --> 02:41:13.200]  The people who they're offering up, they control them all.
[02:41:13.200 --> 02:41:16.240]  Well Bob, you've got to get people from the people to run.
[02:41:16.240 --> 02:41:22.480]  Well Bob, that's something that Collard pointed out last hour, and I've seen it myself.
[02:41:22.480 --> 02:41:27.440]  Our own media is admitting that Mubarak has police dressed up like demonstrators doing
[02:41:27.440 --> 02:41:31.200]  violent things that will be unpopular with the general public.
[02:41:31.200 --> 02:41:36.960]  How can our controlled media tattle on their own dictator about something they undoubtedly
[02:41:36.960 --> 02:41:40.840]  trained him how to do when our own western governments have been caught over and over
[02:41:40.840 --> 02:41:43.840]  again doing the same thing?
[02:41:43.840 --> 02:41:50.000]  And that's correct, and now we found out that again, so Mubarak is dead meat, and that's
[02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:51.000]  great.
[02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:54.800]  I mean, who needs a dictator, I'll give these poor people a break, they're making two bucks
[02:41:54.800 --> 02:41:57.360]  a day, and they have starving to death.
[02:41:57.360 --> 02:41:58.360]  Sure, but that Domino-
[02:41:58.360 --> 02:42:01.480]  It doesn't matter what religion they are, I mean, they're human beings.
[02:42:01.480 --> 02:42:06.600]  But Bob, that Domino falls, great Mubarak gets kicked out, and they were placing with
[02:42:06.600 --> 02:42:12.600]  the Muslim Brotherhood, which it turns out the CIA basically is funding to do this, and
[02:42:12.600 --> 02:42:16.000]  I'm all for the Palestinians getting a better deal and all that.
[02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:24.400]  But why would the globalist be doing something that by the Arabs is seen as positive when
[02:42:24.400 --> 02:42:28.120]  we know that Israel and the United States are wedded at the hip?
[02:42:28.120 --> 02:42:35.800]  Well, again, you're going back to what I said at the beginning, it's a disinformation campaign
[02:42:35.800 --> 02:42:40.960]  to keep people's eye off the ball in Europe and the United States, that's the main thing
[02:42:40.960 --> 02:42:42.840]  that they're doing here.
[02:42:42.840 --> 02:42:50.040]  All of the other changing of leadership, changes of horses, so to speak, they can take care
[02:42:50.040 --> 02:42:51.680]  of that, they're not worried about that.
[02:42:51.680 --> 02:42:52.680]  Bob, I want to go-
[02:42:52.680 --> 02:42:53.680]  It's all almost everybody.
[02:42:53.680 --> 02:42:54.680]  Sure, I want to go to phone calls.
[02:42:54.680 --> 02:42:55.960]  It's like you just pointed out.
[02:42:55.960 --> 02:42:58.120]  I want to go to phone calls, but I want to bring this up to you.
[02:42:58.120 --> 02:43:01.880]  You were on with Lindsey Williams last week, and I've got to hand it to Lindsey.
[02:43:01.880 --> 02:43:06.400]  Three and a half months ago, he did say that Ken From, the former head of operations, Atlantic
[02:43:06.400 --> 02:43:12.720]  Richfield, told him, look at the Middle East to be used as a blow-up, as a distraction
[02:43:12.720 --> 02:43:18.560]  for what China is going to do, and for the economic implosion here and dollar devaluation.
[02:43:18.560 --> 02:43:25.280]  He said watch oil start running up, it was $65, it's now 103, and going up today, and
[02:43:25.280 --> 02:43:27.920]  he's got that other CEO source.
[02:43:27.920 --> 02:43:30.520]  Looks like that's some pretty good intel he's getting.
[02:43:30.520 --> 02:43:35.960]  Yes, the only thing, I don't know how far oil will go.
[02:43:35.960 --> 02:43:43.960]  I don't know whether they'll take it to 150 or 200, but the crude in Europe is over $100
[02:43:43.960 --> 02:43:51.280]  and in the United States it's $90 to $91, and maybe it can get to $120,000.
[02:43:51.280 --> 02:43:54.520]  I find it hard to think that they take it higher than that.
[02:43:54.520 --> 02:44:00.840]  China's really going to, and Japan are going to get whacked really hard because almost
[02:44:00.840 --> 02:44:06.320]  all of their petroleum products are imported.
[02:44:06.320 --> 02:44:10.800]  The projection was there, it's basically correct by Lindsey.
[02:44:10.800 --> 02:44:15.920]  I don't think it's going to go that far, and I don't think they're going to try to blow
[02:44:15.920 --> 02:44:21.480]  up the dollar or any other currency at this time or in a short period of time.
[02:44:21.480 --> 02:44:27.160]  I think it's going to last a little bit longer, and what leads me to believe that is $100
[02:44:27.160 --> 02:44:28.160]  trillion.
[02:44:28.160 --> 02:44:32.520]  I mean, they're saying, hey, let's do this for the next 10 years, and we don't care
[02:44:32.520 --> 02:44:37.200]  if anybody doesn't have any buy power left, we get all our money in gold.
[02:44:37.200 --> 02:44:42.360]  Plus, they get the trillions when they are first issued to the banks, then they get to
[02:44:42.360 --> 02:44:44.440]  loan it out at very high interest.
[02:44:44.440 --> 02:44:48.400]  I saw a CNN report earlier this week that blew me away, Bob, and I don't know if you
[02:44:48.400 --> 02:44:57.000]  saw it was on Monday, but I didn't know the highest credit card APR now in the US is 59.9%.
[02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:59.160]  I thought it was 32.
[02:44:59.160 --> 02:45:00.160]  They've now-
[02:45:00.160 --> 02:45:06.520]  That's credit card reform, is to give the bankers our money, and then they jack up interest
[02:45:06.520 --> 02:45:11.120]  rates to 59.9, I mean, not even loan sharks go that high.
[02:45:11.120 --> 02:45:12.120]  That's right.
[02:45:12.120 --> 02:45:13.480]  And so what do you have?
[02:45:13.480 --> 02:45:17.840]  You have a criminal syndicate, and they got legislation, they got what they wanted, and
[02:45:17.840 --> 02:45:20.200]  they're just screwing everybody.
[02:45:20.200 --> 02:45:27.400]  It's typical, and until there's a major change in America, and probably in Europe and England
[02:45:27.400 --> 02:45:33.760]  as well, this is going to continue, but I think the end game, even if it continued for
[02:45:33.760 --> 02:45:40.280]  six months or five or 10 years, five or 10 years like they're talking about, it doesn't
[02:45:40.280 --> 02:45:43.760]  make any difference, they're going to fail.
[02:45:43.760 --> 02:45:44.760]  Well said, Bob.
[02:45:44.760 --> 02:45:45.760]  Let's take some-
[02:45:45.760 --> 02:45:52.360]  Let's go ahead and borrow time, and that gives us time to inform every single person who
[02:45:52.360 --> 02:45:58.840]  speaks the English language in Africa, in Asia, in Latin America, everywhere in the world,
[02:45:58.840 --> 02:46:02.320]  all the Europeans speak English now.
[02:46:02.320 --> 02:46:07.200]  And what's going to happen is everybody's going to say, okay, finally, they're going
[02:46:07.200 --> 02:46:10.320]  to have their demonstration and say, the game's over.
[02:46:10.320 --> 02:46:11.520]  All those guys, we want them on trial.
[02:46:11.520 --> 02:46:13.840]  If you don't put it on trial, we'll overthrow the government.
[02:46:13.840 --> 02:46:16.520]  That's the way it's going to end up.
[02:46:16.520 --> 02:46:17.520]  And that's what the globalists are doing.
[02:46:17.520 --> 02:46:18.520]  We will go to trial.
[02:46:18.520 --> 02:46:21.720]  And some of them will be hung like our ex-president.
[02:46:21.720 --> 02:46:22.720]  Well, that's-
[02:46:22.720 --> 02:46:26.520]  You've had Lyndon Johnson's already dead.
[02:46:26.520 --> 02:46:27.520]  That's what the-
[02:46:27.520 --> 02:46:35.680]  The Bay of Tonkin incident, or FDR, for lining the ships up in Honolulu so that the Japanese
[02:46:35.680 --> 02:46:40.480]  could bomb them when they had broken the Japanese diplomatic code in 1937.
[02:46:40.480 --> 02:46:41.480]  Well, Bob.
[02:46:41.480 --> 02:46:47.320]  That's one of the things that set me on this journey for over 50 years.
[02:46:47.320 --> 02:46:52.080]  Well, Bob, I want to go to some phone calls now, but that's what the globalists are doing.
[02:46:52.080 --> 02:46:54.000]  They see when revolution is coming.
[02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:58.160]  They're tracking it, and then they go ahead and trigger it early so they can then try
[02:46:58.160 --> 02:47:01.040]  to put their people in, but that trick's only going to last so long.
[02:47:01.040 --> 02:47:02.560]  Chris and Tennessee, you're on the year.
[02:47:02.560 --> 02:47:03.560]  Go ahead.
[02:47:03.560 --> 02:47:05.560]  Hey, how are you doing, Alex?
[02:47:05.560 --> 02:47:06.560]  Good.
[02:47:06.560 --> 02:47:08.400]  Hey, I just wanted to comment on two things.
[02:47:08.400 --> 02:47:13.240]  The first one was, I was listening to your show when Kurt Haskell was on earlier this
[02:47:13.240 --> 02:47:14.240]  week.
[02:47:14.240 --> 02:47:15.240]  Yes.
[02:47:15.240 --> 02:47:19.640]  I was working retail temporarily, and I was talking to a TSA agent and came in.
[02:47:19.640 --> 02:47:23.440]  He was buying some stuff, and I asked him if they had some body scanners at our airport.
[02:47:23.440 --> 02:47:26.320]  He said, no, not yet, but he's hoping to, and I said, well, why is that?
[02:47:26.320 --> 02:47:30.200]  That those are unconstitutional, and he said, well, you clearly don't know what you're
[02:47:30.200 --> 02:47:31.200]  talking about.
[02:47:31.200 --> 02:47:32.680]  We got to have those for security.
[02:47:32.680 --> 02:47:35.760]  I was like, well, actually, sir, I do know what I'm talking about.
[02:47:35.760 --> 02:47:39.360]  I know the Constitution and being a former military policeman in the United States Marine
[02:47:39.360 --> 02:47:47.000]  Corps, I think I know what a search without a warrant or a preemptive search is, and then
[02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:51.240]  you just kind of did the whole don't confuse me with the fact thing of like, well, we got
[02:47:51.240 --> 02:47:54.280]  to do that to protect ourselves.
[02:47:54.280 --> 02:47:57.720]  I think it's kind of sick how they brainwash some of these.
[02:47:57.720 --> 02:48:03.720]  But what they're doing is they're building an army of quasi-cop thugs who are trained
[02:48:03.720 --> 02:48:08.720]  to violate people's personal space and Fourth Amendment, and now the TSA is rolling out on
[02:48:08.720 --> 02:48:09.720]  the streets of America.
[02:48:09.720 --> 02:48:10.720]  I mean, it's incredible.
[02:48:10.720 --> 02:48:11.720]  Yeah.
[02:48:11.720 --> 02:48:17.680]  I mean, just looking at his eyes, I mean, I felt like I was talking to someone who had
[02:48:17.680 --> 02:48:23.000]  was not aware of common sense or logic, as almost as if I was talking to a robot, I mean,
[02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:24.000]  ironically.
[02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:28.520]  Well, they fire the ones that can think, and they're building an army of brown shirt thug
[02:48:28.520 --> 02:48:29.520]  goons.
[02:48:29.520 --> 02:48:31.000]  How does your conversation with him end?
[02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:34.960]  Did he kind of, you know, bug his eyes out at you that you dare challenge his kingship
[02:48:34.960 --> 02:48:35.960]  over you?
[02:48:35.960 --> 02:48:36.960]  Yeah.
[02:48:36.960 --> 02:48:39.720]  He pretty much rolled his eyes and said, well, that's what we got to have to protect
[02:48:39.720 --> 02:48:40.720]  ourselves.
[02:48:40.720 --> 02:48:44.200]  And if you're in the military, you know, those people are crazy, and I was like, well, you
[02:48:44.200 --> 02:48:47.120]  know, I will, I'll have to start paying attention to what's really going on a few years ago
[02:48:47.120 --> 02:48:53.280]  after I was already in, and last time I checked, there wasn't any Muslim terrorist blowing
[02:48:53.280 --> 02:48:56.640]  up things that got in, you know, and they looked in John down the street.
[02:48:56.640 --> 02:49:02.280]  It was some guy who was led on, you know, like the underwear bomber by the Department
[02:49:02.280 --> 02:49:03.280]  of State Agency.
[02:49:03.280 --> 02:49:05.040]  Well, I appreciate your call, Bob.
[02:49:05.040 --> 02:49:11.360]  What do you think about the ABC News report two days ago that, and we're all a lockie
[02:49:11.360 --> 02:49:16.600]  who admittedly works for the Pentagon on record, who runs the Fort Hood shooter, the underwear
[02:49:16.600 --> 02:49:26.400]  bomber, the shoe bomber, the Times Square bomber, was emailing and in control of a woman
[02:49:26.400 --> 02:49:28.960]  at an airport in England to carry out terror.
[02:49:28.960 --> 02:49:33.600]  It's admitted this guy's CIA, and he's out there just recruiting these Patsies.
[02:49:33.600 --> 02:49:35.600]  I mean, this is so transparent.
[02:49:35.600 --> 02:49:38.320]  They just don't care.
[02:49:38.320 --> 02:49:39.440]  They become so arrogant.
[02:49:39.440 --> 02:49:44.640]  You see the same thing in banking on Wall Street, the same attitude, the transnational
[02:49:44.640 --> 02:49:45.640]  corporations.
[02:49:45.640 --> 02:49:50.200]  We don't care what you think, as long as you can't get legislation through with tariffs
[02:49:50.200 --> 02:49:54.400]  and goods and services, we're going to do what we want and keep all our profits offshore,
[02:49:54.400 --> 02:49:57.480]  unless you let us bring them back at five and a quarter percent.
[02:49:57.480 --> 02:49:58.480]  It's the same syndrome.
[02:49:58.480 --> 02:50:01.080]  They don't care.
[02:50:01.080 --> 02:50:06.680]  And you saw the challenge by the district court to the health care reform.
[02:50:06.680 --> 02:50:14.640]  They want to jump over the review court and go to the Supreme Court.
[02:50:14.640 --> 02:50:15.640]  Why?
[02:50:15.640 --> 02:50:16.640]  They own it.
[02:50:16.640 --> 02:50:21.000]  They're going to rub a stampet and rub it, run it through.
[02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:23.040]  The control is in their hands.
[02:50:23.040 --> 02:50:27.280]  They've bought almost everybody.
[02:50:27.280 --> 02:50:34.840]  You know, that's dangerous in history when you've got this much hubris, just with corrupt
[02:50:34.840 --> 02:50:37.800]  groups running absolutely wild.
[02:50:37.800 --> 02:50:43.480]  But truth is the antidote, and hubris always ends in a big fall for tyrants.
[02:50:43.480 --> 02:50:47.560]  And this Humpty Dumpty's already fallen, and all the King's Horses and all the New World
[02:50:47.560 --> 02:50:52.240]  Orders men can't put their New World Order back together again.
[02:50:52.240 --> 02:50:53.920]  It is a certainty.
[02:50:53.920 --> 02:50:58.080]  As Brzezinski said last year, the people are now waking up to their system and the leader
[02:50:58.080 --> 02:50:59.080]  in trouble.
[02:50:59.080 --> 02:51:01.320]  People know the fellow reserves the enemy.
[02:51:01.320 --> 02:51:06.880]  A very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important
[02:51:06.880 --> 02:51:09.600]  day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:51:09.600 --> 02:51:12.160]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:51:12.160 --> 02:51:15.880]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care
[02:51:15.880 --> 02:51:17.520]  of your health and your own family.
[02:51:17.520 --> 02:51:20.520]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:51:20.520 --> 02:51:22.880]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:51:22.880 --> 02:51:27.120]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Pannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest
[02:51:27.120 --> 02:51:29.120]  mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:51:29.120 --> 02:51:32.440]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:51:32.440 --> 02:51:36.600]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest
[02:51:36.600 --> 02:51:39.800]  and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[02:51:39.800 --> 02:51:41.320]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:51:41.320 --> 02:51:43.960]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:51:43.960 --> 02:51:48.240]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:51:48.240 --> 02:51:55.480]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com, that's End of America, the number 3.com.

[02:52:18.520 --> 02:52:23.640]  So I used the program methods and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit
[02:52:23.640 --> 02:52:24.640]  was dismissed.

[02:54:30.840 --> 02:54:31.840]  got a loaded phone lines.
[02:54:31.840 --> 02:54:35.800]  I'll be back Sunday 4-6pm, let's quickly get to some more for Bob Chapman.
[02:54:35.800 --> 02:54:38.680]  Let's talk to Dan in Wisconsin, Dan you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[02:54:38.680 --> 02:54:44.480]  Yeah, thanks a lot Alex, say I just want to say great job to you and your crew, you guys
[02:54:44.480 --> 02:54:45.480]  do well.
[02:54:45.480 --> 02:54:49.280]  Well, it's not that great of a job, this stuff's all right out in the open, that's what's so
[02:54:49.280 --> 02:54:50.280]  crazy.
[02:54:50.280 --> 02:54:55.840]  Yeah, it is, it is crazy, it really is, and I do research it, I'm getting up to speed
[02:54:55.840 --> 02:55:00.480]  on everything, but I do have a quick question for Mr. Chapman, this has been on my mind
[02:55:00.480 --> 02:55:07.080]  for a couple of months as I own a little bit of silver and I guess this is regarding precious
[02:55:07.080 --> 02:55:14.280]  metals for, I guess for investment purposes, so let's say you invest in silver or gold
[02:55:14.280 --> 02:55:23.240]  or something right now, when the dollar finally does blow up, the currency collapses, what
[02:55:23.240 --> 02:55:28.040]  would you cash it in for, your precious metals or would you, I guess you could use silver
[02:55:28.040 --> 02:55:36.520]  for barter in an emergency, if you cashed it in, say silver goes up quite a bit, doubles
[02:55:36.520 --> 02:55:40.840]  your triples or something, you could cash it in before the dollar crashes and make a
[02:55:40.840 --> 02:55:44.720]  lot of profit, but then if the dollar crashes, your dollar is gone.
[02:55:44.720 --> 02:55:48.760]  You'll cash it in for whatever the new currency is or whatever the dollars dominated in that
[02:55:48.760 --> 02:55:54.720]  time, so it basically stops your dollar devaluation, Bob explain it to him, we get this question
[02:55:54.720 --> 02:55:55.720]  a lot.
[02:55:55.720 --> 02:56:00.920]  Yeah, I do too, and you don't know what you're going to exchange it for, it may be a new
[02:56:00.920 --> 02:56:07.480]  currency, it may be the old currency, you may not want to exchange gold and silver for
[02:56:07.480 --> 02:56:14.240]  anything, particularly if you have some kind of a current income, I mean everything is
[02:56:14.240 --> 02:56:20.440]  not going to stop, one third of society will never go into the ditch, so to speak.
[02:56:20.440 --> 02:56:25.400]  So you really got to wait until you get there to find out what moves you're going to make,
[02:56:25.400 --> 02:56:29.840]  and that's why Alex is on the air, he has all these people on the air like myself who
[02:56:29.840 --> 02:56:34.760]  talk about these things, people who subscribe to the international forecaster who get the
[02:56:34.760 --> 02:56:39.880]  news before anybody else, and that's how you stay in touch with everything, it just gives
[02:56:39.880 --> 02:56:41.800]  you know then what to do.
[02:56:41.800 --> 02:56:45.960]  It gives you more options, appreciate the call Dan, great question, Terrence in Florida,
[02:56:45.960 --> 02:56:46.960]  go ahead.
[02:56:46.960 --> 02:56:55.520]  Oh, thank you Alex, and I'll take your reply off air, and dollars versus the veto, 7th
[02:56:55.520 --> 02:57:04.840]  of March 1982, the government has no duty to protect nor provide law and order, Texas
[02:57:04.840 --> 02:57:10.400]  high school student faces arrest and imprisonment for cussing because the local authorities
[02:57:10.400 --> 02:57:16.520]  have decided that pointing guns and arresting people is less violent than cussing.
[02:57:16.520 --> 02:57:24.040]  If every local government employee and elected person is nothing more than a mobaric little
[02:57:24.040 --> 02:57:29.960]  dictator in their own little world, how can we expect the federal government to change
[02:57:29.960 --> 02:57:30.960]  when the local government-
[02:57:30.960 --> 02:57:34.560]  Well, no, that's why the feds have promoted this culture of tyranny as if it's a good
[02:57:34.560 --> 02:57:39.880]  thing to shift our culture from liberty to tyranny so they can have this criminal society,
[02:57:39.880 --> 02:57:40.880]  that's what tyranny is.
[02:57:40.880 --> 02:57:42.720]  I mean, is that your question, Bob?
[02:57:42.720 --> 02:57:43.720]  Well, my question-
[02:57:43.720 --> 02:57:46.520]  Go ahead, Caller.
[02:57:46.520 --> 02:57:50.400]  My question was, how can we expect the federal government to change when the local government
[02:57:50.400 --> 02:57:52.160]  is about to dictators run and lose?
[02:57:52.160 --> 02:57:55.400]  Well, we've got to show them that we're boss and take our governments over through the
[02:57:55.400 --> 02:57:59.680]  elective process and by educating the people generally in the principles of liberty.
