[00:56.560 --> 01:02.960]  truther who is suing Glenn Beck and calling for his firing for defamation
[01:02.960 --> 01:11.840]  saying that this Von Brunner character was a hero to 9-11 truth with no proof
[01:11.840 --> 01:17.800]  going now this is a preliminary report we have no proof could be wrong but then
[01:17.800 --> 01:25.240]  he goes on and says it look the CIA has its first amendment as well and I though
[01:25.240 --> 01:32.720]  it is defamation to a certain extent I lean towards saying that the CIA is not
[01:32.720 --> 01:36.960]  breaking laws with its television program the Glenn Beck program and I mean
[01:36.960 --> 01:45.800]  that is CIA I'm not just saying that it's it's breaking laws in that it is
[01:45.800 --> 01:54.680]  operating inside the United States in propaganda which is still illegal what a
[01:54.680 --> 02:00.960]  ridiculous ringer I have on my cell phone

[02:36.880 --> 02:41.600]  called and they call me once I'm on air I didn't matter guess he thought he was

[08:01.480 --> 08:12.200]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[08:12.200 --> 08:19.720]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas
[08:19.720 --> 08:39.640]  alex jones
[08:39.640 --> 08:44.720]  you know I study the geopolitical makeup of the planet but there's hundreds
[08:44.720 --> 08:49.920]  and hundreds of nations what 180 plus countries all the different regions all
[08:49.920 --> 08:56.720]  the different factions and so I have a basic general knowledge of the world
[08:56.720 --> 09:01.840]  unfortunately the general public has absolutely no general knowledge of the
[09:01.840 --> 09:05.240]  planet don't even know what their state capital is and that's why the
[09:05.240 --> 09:17.160]  establishment can play us as fools but I will say that I have studied Iran quite
[09:17.160 --> 09:21.720]  a bit over the years because the United States and British governments over
[09:21.720 --> 09:27.360]  through their elected pro-western government in 53 using radical Muslims
[09:27.360 --> 09:34.480]  to do it as usual stage terror attacks claiming that the government had attacked
[09:34.480 --> 09:42.120]  mosque and they kicked Muhammad mozadek out and of course the 79 revolution
[09:42.120 --> 09:47.560]  very very suspicious with the moolahs having big connections to the CIA the
[09:47.560 --> 09:54.640]  Ayatollah Khomeini out of Paris and that isn't enough evidence then the arms for
[09:54.640 --> 10:01.800]  hostages Iran Contra where the CIA sold cocaine in the United States to then off
[10:01.800 --> 10:09.360]  the books by weapons systems and give those to Iran this is on record to grab
[10:09.360 --> 10:17.280]  the hostages so that they could then blame it on Jimmy Carter to make him
[10:17.280 --> 10:21.520]  bad and remove him I mean this is sophisticated cloak and dagger stuff and
[10:21.520 --> 10:26.560]  then send the Delta Force into a failed mission and the enemy was waiting in the
[10:26.560 --> 10:30.920]  sandstorm and I've talked to some of the Delta Force guys involved in that
[10:30.920 --> 10:37.400]  definitely is set up and so Iran is a key area in the whole geopolitical system
[10:37.400 --> 10:41.960]  again geopolitical being the system of political science based on regions and
[10:41.960 --> 10:45.400]  tribal and ethnic and religious differences
[10:45.400 --> 10:49.880]  vulcanization it's a it's the common modern name for the British great game
[10:49.880 --> 10:55.760]  how does a tiny imperial island rule over half the planet at that time over
[10:55.760 --> 10:59.240]  100 years ago when they developed the political science of geopolitical
[10:59.240 --> 11:08.520]  strategy Geo the planet meaning region meaning terra firma and so you have that
[11:08.520 --> 11:17.600]  bridge from the Middle East into Asia itself a bridge into Eastern Europe
[11:17.600 --> 11:23.000]  Central Europe Western Europe Northern Europe Russia key area in the chess game
[11:23.000 --> 11:27.360]  kind of the center of the board you want to hold the center of the board the
[11:27.360 --> 11:38.280]  center of the board over Africa Europe Russia Eurasia the Far East the center
[11:38.280 --> 11:47.280]  of the chess board is the Middle East into Central Asia and so I've always
[11:47.280 --> 11:54.160]  tried to be up on Iran and tried to follow what happens over there and I'm
[11:54.160 --> 12:05.320]  a frequent guest on Iranian television I am not a guest on Al Jazeera British
[12:05.320 --> 12:16.320]  intelligence run as he runs the house of sod but nevertheless I do have some
[12:16.320 --> 12:24.760]  knowledge about Iran and some people commented on info wars comm sunday and
[12:24.760 --> 12:35.440]  monday in stories we posted that have a clear leaning against Ahmed Denizide and
[12:35.440 --> 12:39.880]  the moolas and they're saying Alex some are pleasantly surprised they're saying
[12:39.880 --> 12:44.240]  Alex you're really coming out against Iran here well no I'm not coming out
[12:44.240 --> 12:48.400]  against Iran I'm coming out against their corrupt government I'm for the
[12:48.400 --> 12:53.480]  people are you watching the photos and video of these good-looking families
[12:53.480 --> 13:00.840]  and women and men they look just like us they're regular people that like to go
[13:00.840 --> 13:04.160]  out and eat dinner and like to go to the mall and like to go to the opera and
[13:04.160 --> 13:08.160]  they like to paint and they and they invented mathematics and so many other
[13:08.160 --> 13:14.640]  things and that's the people the neocons have you wanting to kill the people
[13:14.640 --> 13:22.120]  being mowed down in the streets by the moolas men so no I didn't want to turn
[13:22.120 --> 13:28.600]  their modern cities into swag heaps and have them hate us when they love us
[13:28.600 --> 13:38.680]  they're sophisticated over there chess was invented in Persia in most histories
[13:38.680 --> 13:43.200]  some say it was invented in northern India but that's the same thing that's
[13:43.200 --> 13:49.080]  the people that colonize northern India the Arian or the Iranian Iranian Iran
[13:49.080 --> 13:57.400]  means Arian in Persian and all that means is the people that came into India
[13:57.400 --> 14:04.520]  from the west and that's the Iranians so the globalists want to destroy any
[14:04.520 --> 14:09.400]  independent nation any nation any nation they call rogue is a country that
[14:09.400 --> 14:13.760]  isn't under the globalist control does that mean I like Zimbabwe no does that
[14:13.760 --> 14:17.720]  mean I like Phil Castro no does that mean I like Hugo Chavez no does that
[14:17.720 --> 14:25.080]  mean I like Ahmed Dinajid no the issue is they aren't under the globalist
[14:25.080 --> 14:30.440]  control when Gaddafi went ahead and said fine go ahead bring the UN and shoot my
[14:30.440 --> 14:36.600]  population up with hepatitis and HIV suddenly they said he's a hero he's a
[14:36.600 --> 14:41.360]  wonderful person and you can Google mainstream news back do it right now
[14:41.360 --> 14:49.040]  guys HIV inoculations Libya they caught the UN workers doing it and then the
[14:49.040 --> 14:54.800]  BBC spends it and goes okay 80% of the kids in these hospitals did get HIV but
[14:54.800 --> 15:00.000]  no one knows where they got it they have a UN funded inoculation and little
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.520]  bitty kids that have never had no sexual intercourse they've been medically
[15:02.520 --> 15:07.800]  checked all have HIV the UN has been caught doing it all over the planet and
[15:07.800 --> 15:12.120]  as soon as Gaddafi said I'll take your central bank you're the boss they told
[15:12.120 --> 15:17.960]  us on the news he's now a hero he's now a good guy he's now our friend that's how
[15:17.960 --> 15:22.000]  sick the new world order is no I don't like Colonel Muammar Gaddafi the
[15:22.000 --> 15:26.760]  dictator now the head of the African Union for the globalist and you talk
[15:26.760 --> 15:30.160]  about the African Union on air I get emails going there's no such thing as
[15:30.160 --> 15:35.040]  an African Union you're lying and making that up
[15:38.000 --> 15:42.560]  no there is an official African Union parliament it is officially in operation
[15:42.560 --> 15:46.440]  for seven years just as there's a Mediterranean Union an Asian Union a
[15:46.440 --> 15:51.080]  North American Union one more side issue before I give you my take my view on
[15:51.080 --> 15:58.240]  Iran and it's still really too early to tell but I'm it's starting to lean
[15:58.240 --> 16:03.800]  towards this is a stolen election and regardless you got to admire the spirit
[16:03.800 --> 16:06.680]  of the Iranian people
[16:09.920 --> 16:13.600]  but before I do that I wanted one more program note we had David icon who I
[16:13.600 --> 16:19.280]  agree with on about 98% of things I don't get into the off-world stuff but the
[16:19.280 --> 16:23.320]  guy's an icon just like I'm an icon in the Liberty movement the Awakening
[16:23.320 --> 16:27.440]  movement there's not many people is anybody else the stature David I can
[16:27.440 --> 16:34.520]  I so I have him on I like David he's a classy guy but I was talking about the
[16:34.520 --> 16:41.800]  reptilian brain from Grey's Anatomy from taught for a hundred years in
[16:41.800 --> 16:46.360]  physiology and anatomy not about reptoids I'm getting all these emails you can see
[16:46.360 --> 16:50.600]  the YouTube videos up on info wars people saying from the first clip oh
[16:50.600 --> 16:54.880]  there's no reptoid brain I'm not saying if you pull your skin off there's a
[16:54.880 --> 17:00.560]  lizard under you I'm saying there's a primitive brain sitting on top the
[17:00.560 --> 17:04.760]  brainstem the brainstem by the way runs breathing in the heart and things like
[17:04.760 --> 17:09.320]  that I'm not talking about that about the reptilian brain it's identical to a
[17:09.320 --> 17:13.240]  saltwater crocodile brain that sits on top of that and that's where the sex
[17:13.240 --> 17:18.320]  drive and money and survival and viciousness when you get in a fight with
[17:18.320 --> 17:22.440]  somebody and you know you've got really incredible strength when you're doing it
[17:22.440 --> 17:25.360]  you know they've done hypnotism with weight lifters they can live twice as
[17:25.360 --> 17:29.680]  much once the governor's removed psychologically that's the reptilian
[17:29.680 --> 17:32.720]  brain when a little woman has her two-year-old pinned under a car and
[17:32.720 --> 17:36.400]  it's screaming for mommy to help this is on record you know police reports and
[17:36.400 --> 17:42.080]  firemen reports and the woman picks up a two thousand pound car that's the
[17:42.080 --> 17:52.560]  reptilian brain you understand and it's a scientific fact I'm not talking about
[17:52.560 --> 17:56.520]  day that I can you know could extraterrestrials be manipulating the
[17:56.520 --> 17:59.800]  planet that are reptoids and how about the reptilian brain but that shows
[17:59.800 --> 18:03.680]  ignorant people is there is a European Union there is an African Union and we
[18:03.680 --> 18:09.600]  do have a reptilian brain and you just go ahead and say it doesn't exist that's
[18:09.600 --> 18:18.960]  fine anybody who's had even first-year physiology will know that first-year
[18:18.960 --> 18:25.080]  anatomy but if you like being ignorant making jokes and you know and all that
[18:25.080 --> 18:37.320]  kind of stuff fine okay that said the polls in Iran and the numbers we've
[18:37.320 --> 18:44.160]  seen out of there show that Ahmed Denizide barely won when he got into
[18:44.160 --> 18:49.040]  office four or five years ago barely won and the moderate got thrown out
[18:49.040 --> 18:52.320]  because they've been over to the UN they did whatever the globalist said and
[18:52.320 --> 18:57.040]  that wasn't enough and they got rebuked and it's even come out in neocon memos
[18:57.040 --> 19:01.000]  that was in the New York Times over the weekend that they preferred Ahmed Denizide
[19:01.000 --> 19:16.600]  win Denizide Denizide that's what they prefer and he's connected to the
[19:16.600 --> 19:26.720]  memos that have all the CIA connections and the Iranian people have also on the
[19:26.720 --> 19:32.200]  other side it had been manipulated because the globalist play both sides by
[19:32.200 --> 19:38.120]  the CIA and remember right when Iraq got invaded six years ago there was
[19:38.120 --> 19:42.200]  suddenly riots and burning again and the CIA admitted they were manipulating
[19:42.200 --> 19:46.560]  that at the time inside Iran so when we come back those are the basic facts what

[24:52.520 --> 24:55.320]  I just love her voice
[24:55.320 --> 25:08.900]  Yeah, the Iranians are going crazy on the moulas, and that's who you want to kill, who you
[25:08.900 --> 25:14.880]  want to drop nuclear bombs on, good old boys, when you go, ah, turn them into a glass parking
[25:14.880 --> 25:15.880]  lot.
[25:15.880 --> 25:23.720]  Really, kill all those little kids, people you don't even know, can't even find it on
[25:23.720 --> 25:24.720]  a map.
[25:24.720 --> 25:31.520]  I hear these stupid people call them Arabs, as if an Arab is bad, no, but they're not
[25:31.520 --> 25:42.880]  Arabs, and they're going crazy on the moulas.
[25:42.880 --> 25:50.960]  So what's really happening, what's really unfolding over in Iran?
[25:50.960 --> 25:55.200]  So you've got the moulas with their CIA history, that doesn't mean they're completely under
[25:55.200 --> 26:00.920]  the control of the CIA, they use each other, this is how, at the high level, governments
[26:00.920 --> 26:03.760]  operate, and organizations operate.
[26:03.760 --> 26:08.960]  The Shah was modernizing the country, he was breaking away from the globalist, he was not
[26:08.960 --> 26:13.840]  following orders, there's suddenly a coup, he gets taken out, he dies of cancer just
[26:13.840 --> 26:18.760]  a few weeks later, and there's even mainline books written about how they killed him, with
[26:18.760 --> 26:26.720]  the radiation gun from the hotel room right next door, which they've now declassified
[26:26.720 --> 26:27.720]  they've got.
[26:27.720 --> 26:33.080]  That's why they're tethering a lot of these Homeland Security bluffs at high altitude,
[26:33.080 --> 26:36.880]  they just cook you for a few minutes one night and you die a month later of what they call
[26:36.880 --> 26:44.720]  cancer, but side issue, just vector that weapon system in.
[26:44.720 --> 26:48.200]  What's really happening over in Iran?
[26:48.200 --> 26:51.360]  The answer is we don't know.
[26:51.360 --> 27:02.760]  We do know that half of Iran's population is now below the age of 25.
[27:02.760 --> 27:08.840]  They have not been under globalist control, so they have on average four and a half children,
[27:08.840 --> 27:13.360]  and they're young people, and they're tired of being bossed around by the moulas, and
[27:13.360 --> 27:17.200]  the moulas argument is we're protecting you from the great Satan's brainwashing television
[27:17.200 --> 27:19.880]  to break up your families and sterilize you.
[27:19.880 --> 27:24.560]  Oh, yeah, they know what's going on, and the moulas talk about it and discuss it, and
[27:24.560 --> 27:30.760]  the public knows a lot of that's true, and they go, fine, we're not going with the globalist,
[27:30.760 --> 27:35.480]  we're not going with the Americans, but we're tired of being bossed around by you, and we
[27:35.480 --> 27:39.920]  want freedom, and we don't like the fact that these presidents are elected, but they still
[27:39.920 --> 27:46.760]  report to the Grand Council, and so it's a figurehead position.
[27:46.760 --> 27:49.480]  We want real reforms and economic reforms.
[27:49.480 --> 27:53.480]  We don't like the fact that the moulas and the ruling council owns most of the big major
[27:53.480 --> 27:59.760]  companies and that their families are all a bunch of spoiled brats getting big and fat
[27:59.760 --> 28:03.920]  off of controlling the market and controlling who can do what.
[28:03.920 --> 28:08.360]  Just like here, we have big corporations owned by big families, and the government goes in
[28:08.360 --> 28:10.200]  and shuts down their competition.
[28:10.200 --> 28:12.720]  Same thing, they're monopoly men.
[28:12.720 --> 28:17.740]  The people are mad at the moulas over their business corruption.
[28:17.740 --> 28:23.880]  That's the number one complaint with the Iranian people, and they're sick of it, and so they're
[28:23.880 --> 28:29.120]  telling the moulas, look, don't give us your jack about the U.S. going to nuke us anymore.
[28:29.120 --> 28:33.480]  We'll handle that, and if America attacks us, we'll fight back, but you are not going
[28:33.480 --> 28:39.840]  to sit here and use us as your slaves.
[28:39.840 --> 28:43.520]  And so when the neocons threaten to attack Iran and when they menace them and bring ships
[28:43.520 --> 28:53.840]  in to attack them and have the Saudi Arabian-backed Wahhabis Shias, excuse me, Sunnis, attack Shia,
[28:53.840 --> 28:57.520]  controlled Iran, that only makes Ahmed Denizide stronger.
[28:57.520 --> 29:02.960]  And so the argument of the moulas in Ahmed Denizide is, look, we've got to, even though
[29:02.960 --> 29:07.440]  we lost, and that's probably, my gut tells me that it's steel, that there are reports
[29:07.440 --> 29:14.440]  coming out of Iran, not just out of CIA-controlled publications like the London Telegraph, that
[29:14.440 --> 29:18.400]  just all over the nation people are saying they voted for him, young and old, they're
[29:18.400 --> 29:24.800]  sick of it, and that preliminary reports out of different regions had Ahmed Denizide at
[29:24.800 --> 29:28.760]  number three, not even number one, that he was in third place, so I'll finish up and
[29:28.760 --> 29:34.480]  we'll get back and then go to your calls and also break down North Korea, 1-800-25-99231.
[29:34.480 --> 29:40.320]  And on another issue, so outrageous, so we're going to play the video next hour and break
[29:40.320 --> 29:44.960]  it down, Trooper claims Dashboard Cam upholds his actions.
[29:44.960 --> 29:51.120]  Talk about delusional, this guy's out of his mind, stay with us.
[29:51.120 --> 30:00.400]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.400 --> 30:04.360]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us
[30:04.360 --> 30:08.960]  in the truth movement for years, InnerHealth Botanicals, this company produces the highest
[30:08.960 --> 30:11.760]  quality superfood around, called InnerFood.
[30:11.760 --> 30:17.080]  My wife just loves the stuff, and now the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded InnerFood,
[30:17.080 --> 30:21.120]  his editor's choice award, one best superfood of 2009.
[30:21.120 --> 30:25.680]  InnerFood is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients, no fillers, no sweeteners.
[30:25.680 --> 30:30.480]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price, and their formula really works.
[30:30.480 --> 30:33.280]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[30:33.280 --> 30:38.360]  Try the Nutra Cafe, their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the
[30:38.360 --> 30:39.360]  immune system.
[30:39.360 --> 30:43.960]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great, and take it from me folks, it really does taste
[30:43.960 --> 30:44.960]  great.
[30:44.960 --> 30:46.480]  Don't forget to try their other great products.

[30:58.840 --> 31:26.400]  for special pricing.
[31:28.840 --> 31:34.880]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[31:34.880 --> 31:46.720]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[31:46.720 --> 31:52.600]  Order in-game on DVD at www.prisonplanet.com or infowars.com, or watch it online right
[31:52.600 --> 31:54.600]  now at www.prisonplanet.tv.
[31:54.600 --> 32:00.160]  In-game blueprint for global enslavement, you have been warned.
[32:00.160 --> 32:04.200]  Hi this is Alex Jones, did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[32:04.200 --> 32:07.120]  seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[32:07.120 --> 32:11.160]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver
[32:11.160 --> 32:12.160]  or gold?
[32:12.160 --> 32:15.520]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's
[32:15.520 --> 32:17.700]  possible that could even happen again.
[32:17.700 --> 32:21.840]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[32:21.840 --> 32:22.840]  seeds.
[32:22.840 --> 32:28.200]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense
[32:28.200 --> 32:30.040]  food for you and your family.
[32:30.040 --> 32:33.920]  And here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way,
[32:33.920 --> 32:37.840]  and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[32:37.840 --> 32:47.960]  So visit them today at www.survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365, that's
[32:47.960 --> 32:52.080]  877-327-0365.
[32:52.080 --> 32:56.920]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[32:56.920 --> 33:26.760]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[33:56.920 --> 34:09.520]  All right, your call's coming up momentarily, but continuing to break down the Iranian situation.
[34:09.520 --> 34:14.440]  Iran bars the foreign media from reporting on the streets, but enough of it's getting
[34:14.440 --> 34:20.800]  out via YouTube and Google and other channels that they have shot way more than nine people.
[34:20.800 --> 34:28.320]  That number's a day old, and Ahmed Denizide and Amulis in the last two days told people
[34:28.320 --> 34:31.640]  on the news, if you come out in the streets, we're going to shoot you.
[34:31.640 --> 34:35.880]  And they've murdered people in cold blood on the streets.
[34:35.880 --> 34:39.600]  Now according to the brainwashed mindset we have in the United States towards the police
[34:39.600 --> 34:45.360]  and military, where they can do no wrong, how do you compute that, Robbie the Robot?
[34:45.360 --> 34:50.000]  It's okay for cops here to shoot protesters, and it's okay here for cops to kill people
[34:50.000 --> 34:53.880]  in cold blood in order to.
[34:53.880 --> 34:56.440]  But is it okay when Iran does it?
[34:56.440 --> 34:59.640]  See, because the cops are bad and corrupt and Iran, right?
[34:59.640 --> 35:03.440]  And they're bad and corrupt in China, and Hugo Chavez, they're bad and corrupt there.
[35:03.440 --> 35:05.720]  Why, they spy on their people.
[35:05.720 --> 35:11.840]  They torture sometimes, oh, but the United States, when they do it, it's okay.
[35:11.840 --> 35:16.240]  See how we're morally bankrupt?
[35:16.240 --> 35:18.520]  What do you think the military would do if we marched on Washington?
[35:18.520 --> 35:20.480]  Well they have public plans under Northcom.
[35:20.480 --> 35:25.960]  Northcom stated in the Army Times that they will shoot Americans, and they've been on
[35:25.960 --> 35:30.360]  ABC News saying, yeah, we're training to shoot Americans.
[35:30.360 --> 35:35.120]  They are training, and I've been to their urban warfare drills, to kill you.
[35:35.120 --> 35:38.720]  Now it's woken the military up, the military doesn't like it.
[35:38.720 --> 35:42.240]  But the cops are used to knocking heads of the citizens all day, and they have a disdain
[35:42.240 --> 35:46.480]  for us on average, and they've done the sociological, psychological studies on them.
[35:46.480 --> 35:51.280]  They will, about half of them, blow you away with lead.
[35:51.280 --> 35:54.320]  They've given them the training aids of rubber bullets and pepper spray.
[35:54.320 --> 36:00.960]  Now they're trained like an attack dog's trained on a dummy, then a man in a suit, and then
[36:00.960 --> 36:04.440]  on the real thing.
[36:04.440 --> 36:09.480]  And so I have no doubt that Ahmed Enigie lost, because he's been unpopular.
[36:09.480 --> 36:11.400]  He's admitted that.
[36:11.400 --> 36:16.320]  The results came out very, very early, just like they did here in 2000, in 2004, another
[36:16.320 --> 36:20.560]  sign of cheating.
[36:20.560 --> 36:28.520]  Exit polls from regions showed him in third place.
[36:28.520 --> 36:33.080]  And the neocons wanted to keep him in power.
[36:33.080 --> 36:41.480]  If they had a choice of a moderate who would increase women's rights and modernize the
[36:41.480 --> 36:45.200]  country more, they wanted him over this reformer.
[36:45.200 --> 36:48.600]  Do you think they want some nice, friendly guy that will be friends with the U.S.?
[36:48.600 --> 36:49.760]  No, they want war.
[36:49.760 --> 36:51.280]  They want to freak everybody out.
[36:51.280 --> 36:59.640]  They want a sense of fear in the region, an excuse to blame everything on.
[36:59.640 --> 37:00.640]  That's going on in Iraq.
[37:00.640 --> 37:06.160]  They want to blame it on Iran.
[37:06.160 --> 37:15.400]  They want to bring a radical Muslim government in over the government that's there now.
[37:15.400 --> 37:20.000]  And so that's the perfect excuse for the Iranian government saying, if any government attacks
[37:20.000 --> 37:23.920]  us, if any military attacks us, you will be destroyed.
[37:23.920 --> 37:28.080]  You will not like the response you get, and he's on TV saying all these millions of people
[37:28.080 --> 37:32.800]  in the streets, they're being manipulated by the great Satan.
[37:32.800 --> 37:37.560]  To an certain extent, they are being manipulated by the West, but they have real grievances.
[37:37.560 --> 37:45.280]  And so as I always do, I stand with the people that are bravely out there being gunned down
[37:45.280 --> 37:49.600]  by the Mullahs' police.
[37:49.600 --> 37:52.880]  And I will hope that the world will stand with the United States after the bankers are
[37:52.880 --> 37:57.200]  done robbing and stealing everything, and the people find out we've been totally bankrupted
[37:57.200 --> 38:01.880]  and put into financial bondage, that the people will try to peacefully stand up and say no.
[38:01.880 --> 38:07.160]  And then the paramilitary police are going to open fire and kill U.S. citizens, and they're
[38:07.160 --> 38:10.920]  going to have lots of excuses to do it, except they're more sophisticated here.
[38:10.920 --> 38:15.840]  They're going to set off truck bombs and claim that the protesters did it and use that as
[38:15.840 --> 38:18.520]  an excuse to mow everybody down.
[38:18.520 --> 38:21.600]  And then we're off to the races.
[38:21.600 --> 38:27.520]  I've always said I'm not for offensive attacks on the criminal illegitimate banker, foreign
[38:27.520 --> 38:36.280]  corporate government, the occupational government, because they would use that politically against
[38:36.280 --> 38:39.300]  us, and they're set and ready for that.
[38:39.300 --> 38:48.360]  But when they mow Americans down and then simultaneously set off a truck bomb at a government
[38:48.360 --> 38:53.040]  daycare center, don't be stupid.
[38:53.040 --> 38:54.720]  Understand they did that.
[38:54.720 --> 38:58.400]  Just as sure as the sun comes up in the morning and sets in the evening.
[38:58.400 --> 39:02.080]  Just as sure as I'm here living and breathing and talking to you right now, they're going
[39:02.080 --> 39:07.480]  to use false flag terror and blame it on people, and they're going to say that I am involved
[39:07.480 --> 39:11.640]  with terrorism, and they're going to come and arrest me.
[39:11.640 --> 39:16.240]  And after two or three years of them diesel treatment driving me around in 100-degree temperature,
[39:16.240 --> 39:21.960]  beating me up, drugging me, they'll probably bring a dull-eyed, brainwashed, chemically
[39:21.960 --> 39:25.920]  lobotomized Alex Jones out on TV, and I'll say whatever they want, but no, that's not
[39:25.920 --> 39:28.320]  Alex Jones anymore.
[39:28.320 --> 39:32.480]  That's a husk of what I was, and for anybody else they do that.
[39:32.480 --> 39:36.440]  Only by preempting their operations do we have victory over them in the end, even if
[39:36.440 --> 39:42.200]  they carry out that operation.
[39:42.200 --> 39:45.200]  Just like North Korea after two, three years, or the North Vietnamese for two, three years
[39:45.200 --> 39:51.360]  will take our best fighter pilots, our best men, and have them come out broken and say
[39:51.360 --> 39:53.640]  whatever they were told with torture.
[39:53.640 --> 40:01.760]  Just like after six years, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in custody came out and confessed to everything.
[40:01.760 --> 40:05.320]  He might as well have confessed to sinking the Titanic, the Lusitania, the Reichstag
[40:05.320 --> 40:12.480]  fire, killing Kennedy and Lincoln, and attempting to kill Andrew Jackson.
[40:12.480 --> 40:18.760]  He confessed to bombing buildings that weren't built till four years after he was arrested,
[40:18.760 --> 40:25.440]  and the government in the news said, yeah, we roughed up his kids and his wife.
[40:25.440 --> 40:31.160]  That's torture, and then threatened to torture them more, so after being water-boarded hundreds
[40:31.160 --> 40:36.480]  of times, the guy wouldn't say what they wanted.
[40:36.480 --> 40:42.800]  After being water-boarded every day, hour after hour after hour after hour, they finally
[40:42.800 --> 40:48.040]  went to his kids and he said, okay, I'll say whatever you want, and the government had
[40:48.040 --> 40:53.160]  such contempt, they told him to confess to bombing buildings that didn't exist until
[40:53.160 --> 40:59.000]  after he was in jail.
[40:59.000 --> 41:02.080]  They think you're so dumb that when they were claiming terrorists were going to blow up
[41:02.080 --> 41:06.720]  an L.A. building and that torture stopped it, they called it freedom towers.
[41:06.720 --> 41:12.360]  It's never had that name, but they wanted the image on Fox News of Al Qaeda wanted to
[41:12.360 --> 41:18.280]  blow up freedom towers, and then they cut to video of the same building being blown up
[41:18.280 --> 41:28.120]  in the film Independence Day, with aliens blowing it up as the artist rendering of it.
[41:28.120 --> 41:31.040]  I mean, that's how dumb they think you are.
[41:31.040 --> 41:44.240]  Such the sheer contempt and disgust that they have for you.
[41:44.240 --> 41:50.760]  So what's going on in Iran, he is Western back to a certain extent, and so that's the
[41:50.760 --> 41:57.680]  excuse of the Mullahs to say we're fighting an outside alien force, but these people legitimately
[41:57.680 --> 42:02.120]  want more freedom and more liberty, and they don't like the economic tyranny of the Mullahs.
[42:02.120 --> 42:06.160]  So I'm against attacking Iran because what the globalists want, it's wrong, Iran has
[42:06.160 --> 42:15.000]  done nothing, and been overthrown several times by the globalist in our name, and I
[42:15.000 --> 42:22.600]  don't want to see oil prices $300 a barrel, and I don't want to see World War III.
[42:22.600 --> 42:28.840]  I don't like Kim Jong-il of North Korea, and he's now in a power transfer to his son,
[42:28.840 --> 42:34.200]  the grandson of the first dictator, and so right as that's happening, they start seeing
[42:34.200 --> 42:37.560]  they're going to interdict their ships and doing drills and moving troops up to the border
[42:37.560 --> 42:43.880]  and increasing aircraft going into North Korean airspace, and so they test an A-bomb to try
[42:43.880 --> 42:48.040]  to back everybody off so they can stay in power.
[42:48.040 --> 42:51.520]  See the globalists are ready, they've lined up all their dominoes, they're ready to start
[42:51.520 --> 42:59.440]  it, with Russia and Georgia, with South Ossetia and Abkhazia, in the Far East, on the Korean
[42:59.440 --> 43:05.080]  Peninsula with that situation, with Iran, with Pakistan, just like the Iran Corporation
[43:05.080 --> 43:09.320]  and the Big New Brzezinski have said, they want to start a global conflagration that
[43:09.320 --> 43:13.520]  will lead into India and China and Eastern Europe and Central Europe and the Middle
[43:13.520 --> 43:14.520]  East.
[43:14.520 --> 43:18.320]  I mean, it's all lined up, it's all ready to go, and we're going to pay for it with
[43:18.320 --> 43:23.200]  blood and money, and it'll be, oh, wave the flag, America's in a war, you can't question
[43:23.200 --> 43:27.360]  GM being given to foreign corporations, you can't question tens of trillions every six
[43:27.360 --> 43:31.440]  months stolen by foreign banks, you can't question checkpoints on the streets in North
[43:31.440 --> 43:36.960]  Kong, make sign up for martial law, because we just got hit by Iran, we just got hit by
[43:36.960 --> 43:43.040]  sleeper cells from North Korea, Chicago just got hit, Dallas just got hit, we can't have
[43:43.040 --> 43:46.920]  to send in, and then what's Alex Jones going to do, if I'm even on the air when that happens,
[43:46.920 --> 43:52.960]  Obama's saying he's taking over the web before it's safety, so he can, quote, turn it off
[43:52.960 --> 43:57.520]  if we go to war and the enemy is using it, and if you really believe it's, quote, enemies
[43:57.520 --> 44:03.680]  going in and using the internet to turn off defibrillators and ventilators, and if you
[44:03.680 --> 44:07.240]  really believe all that, you really believe it's foreigners hacking Air Force One, I've
[44:07.240 --> 44:11.920]  got a bridge I want to sell you, it's more false flagging, Pentagon even admits they're,
[44:11.920 --> 44:16.400]  quote, probing their own systems, they're making their move and it's against free humanity
[44:16.400 --> 44:20.520]  worldwide, it's the global government using a few set peace nations they're going to
[44:20.520 --> 44:28.080]  go into as the boogeyman when the real attack is on us, so we will tribally get behind the
[44:28.080 --> 44:32.120]  government, just like when they hit us on 9-11, and I'm telling you, your whole way
[44:32.120 --> 44:36.680]  of life, everything's gone, all the freedom's gone, we go into bondage, if you let them
[44:36.680 --> 44:40.360]  sucker you, and they're testing right now, if they think you're going to go along with
[44:40.360 --> 44:45.000]  it, they're going to hit North Korea, they're going to hit Iran, they're going to hit Pakistan,
[44:45.000 --> 44:50.240]  they're going to hit South Ossetia again, and ladies and gentlemen, they may not even
[44:50.240 --> 44:55.480]  need to set off nukes, there are real sleeper cells of different countries here, that's
[44:55.480 --> 45:01.160]  what special forces do, they got to stay behind armies, and I'm telling you, this is the end
[45:01.160 --> 45:06.920]  of everything we know is free and good, you got me, all right, let's go to your calls,
[45:06.920 --> 45:12.960]  people that disagree first, Reb in Colorado, you're on the air Reb, there's three of us,
[45:12.960 --> 45:19.640]  Bubba, Scout, and Reb, and we got printed on the internet, and then message boards where
[45:19.640 --> 45:26.760]  it said, we want the Lakewood, Colorado, PD, and Jefferson, Colorado, PD exterminated,
[45:26.760 --> 45:31.920]  and we gave the names and addresses, and no feds are going to go near us, all right, you're
[45:31.920 --> 45:38.080]  not going to provocateur on my show, you sound very unstable, but whatever, we don't screen
[45:38.080 --> 45:39.080]  the calls.
[45:39.080 --> 45:42.200]  See, I think I'm going to get rid of this rule that if you disagree with another line,
[45:42.200 --> 45:45.920]  because it just puts the quacks at the other line, I mean, they never really disagree,
[45:45.920 --> 45:51.320]  it's just, and we're going to go after the feds, and then they end up coming and getting
[45:51.320 --> 45:52.320]  you.
[45:52.320 --> 45:57.000]  Man, I tell you what, John in Ohio, you're on the air and disagree, go ahead.
[45:57.000 --> 46:03.480]  Yes, Alex, I got a panoply of things on Iran, and apparently who you're going to have on
[46:03.480 --> 46:09.160]  the third hour, I would ask people to check up on Google, any search engine, the not so
[46:09.160 --> 46:16.440]  spontaneous libertarian, the not so spontaneous libertarian, it gives a long history of the
[46:16.440 --> 46:21.200]  artificial synthetic libertarianism that was really funded by some of the biggest banks
[46:21.200 --> 46:22.200]  and bankers.
[46:22.200 --> 46:25.760]  Well, I think we saw that with Bombard, right when libertarians got big, taking it over
[46:25.760 --> 46:31.840]  to another spook who doesn't have a very good record compared to somebody like Ron Paul,
[46:31.840 --> 46:36.120]  but I will tell you, it is organic to Ron Paul movement, buddy, and I know it is, because
[46:36.120 --> 46:40.520]  I'm on the inside of it, and the bankers are threatened by it, that's why they're trying
[46:40.520 --> 46:45.640]  to link us to Von Brune and all the rest of this, and I believe in a free market.
[46:45.640 --> 46:50.720]  I know they use fake free market ideology to have these robber barons sucking off of
[46:50.720 --> 46:52.640]  us, but that's two different birds.
[46:52.640 --> 46:56.520]  Since time is limited, I just ask people to check it out.
[46:56.520 --> 47:00.600]  It's not limited, go ahead and make your point.
[47:00.600 --> 47:01.600]  Okay.
[47:01.600 --> 47:08.080]  Now, on Iran, I agree with you, I think you're one of the most important people in exposing
[47:08.080 --> 47:15.720]  the 9-11 and other false flag terrorism, the police state, and these other operations,
[47:15.720 --> 47:21.920]  but I think in the case of why Ron Paul gets so much TV time, it's precisely because it
[47:21.920 --> 47:28.440]  is the goal of the globalist, as you call them, the international bankers, the Malapit
[47:28.440 --> 47:34.440]  capitalists, as I would call them, to completely destroy the living standards, loot all of
[47:34.440 --> 47:39.240]  the resources of the country, the living standards of the working class, and that is what they
[47:39.240 --> 47:40.240]  said.
[47:40.240 --> 47:41.240]  They're on record.
[47:41.240 --> 47:42.240]  Monopoly capitalist is the proper name.
[47:42.240 --> 47:50.080]  Yeah, the social wage, which is all of those things that were granted under great pressure,
[47:50.080 --> 47:54.160]  the social net, with all of their abuses.
[47:54.160 --> 47:55.160]  It's all being removed.
[47:55.160 --> 48:01.400]  Which is a political tool, so then we're forced to join the youth brigades, forced to join
[48:01.400 --> 48:02.920]  the corporate slave army.
[48:02.920 --> 48:03.920]  I agree.
[48:03.920 --> 48:10.000]  Now, on Iran, I believe that we don't know what's going on, because there are these CIA,
[48:10.000 --> 48:15.800]  NED, NGO, George Soros, Color Revolution, they're just a bunch of people.
[48:15.800 --> 48:16.800]  Look, it is a color.
[48:16.800 --> 48:17.800]  The color's green.
[48:17.800 --> 48:20.080]  They always use a color to dumb it down, yeah.
[48:20.080 --> 48:25.960]  Yeah, whether it's the overthrow of the former governor of the states and the provinces of
[48:25.960 --> 48:30.680]  the Soviet Union and Georgia, Ukraine, and the rest of it, there's an awful lot of subversion
[48:30.680 --> 48:31.680]  going on.
[48:31.680 --> 48:36.760]  Your CNN is, as you know, nothing but a scythe up of the Pentagon, and they're constantly
[48:36.760 --> 48:38.720]  giving a face time to which...
[48:38.720 --> 48:42.560]  By the way, it's on record, CIA is completely CIA-commanded.
[48:42.560 --> 48:43.560]  Right.
[48:43.560 --> 48:49.400]  And when you've got people like Christian Almond Puerh, who always turns up at these
[48:49.400 --> 48:55.240]  color revolutions for CNN to give the impression that he's married to the former deputy secretary
[48:55.240 --> 48:56.240]  of state under Clinton.
[48:56.240 --> 48:57.240]  Yeah, Jamie.
[48:57.240 --> 48:58.240]  Yeah, right.
[48:58.240 --> 49:03.080]  So, who slaughtered and dismembered Yugoslavia.
[49:03.080 --> 49:08.600]  We don't quite know what's going on, but we know that there are elements there that people
[49:08.600 --> 49:16.920]  like Brzezinski, who runs Obama, would like to use Iran in this more tilted emphasis towards
[49:16.920 --> 49:22.880]  a surrounding and making war ultimately with Russia and China.
[49:22.880 --> 49:28.720]  And in that case, if they feel they can turn a color revolution in Iran towards that end,
[49:28.720 --> 49:31.760]  I think it would be an even greater danger than that.
[49:31.760 --> 49:32.960]  Now, that's what Tarpley says.
[49:32.960 --> 49:34.880]  They plan to have a color revolution.
[49:34.880 --> 49:39.280]  The Iranians have always headed the Russians and further encirclement of Russia and China.
[49:39.280 --> 49:40.640]  Now, we see where this is going.
[49:40.640 --> 49:42.400]  I mean, look at North Korea.
[49:42.400 --> 49:47.120]  How right when that thing is in flux, they're trying to stampede them into launching a nuke.
[49:47.120 --> 49:52.840]  It's that, you know, with the United States having 40,000 troops, they're constant the
[49:52.840 --> 49:59.120]  huge war games to provoke them and nuclear submarines are on their shores constantly
[49:59.120 --> 50:02.720]  and the embargoes, yes, this is a defensive nuke.
[50:02.720 --> 50:06.920]  And all the embargoes do is make more of the poor people starved to death in that country.
[50:06.920 --> 50:09.320]  Yes, that's all it does.
[50:09.320 --> 50:14.840]  If they flooded North Korea with money and food and business, that would help the people.
[50:14.840 --> 50:18.880]  And then that over time would actually destabilize Kim Jong-il and his disgusting dynasty.
[50:18.880 --> 50:26.360]  But no, they love that little demonic hermitage set up there, that reclusive sickening state.
[50:26.360 --> 50:31.040]  All we know is whatever they're going to do is to try to overthrow them.
[50:31.040 --> 50:37.560]  By one means or another, flooding them with subversive types of the CIA business types
[50:37.560 --> 50:43.520]  and the rest of it, and I believe we've got to get some other sources of information.
[50:43.520 --> 50:55.040]  And ultimately, I believe you're a physician on anti-communism, I think, is totally birch-eyed
[50:55.040 --> 50:56.960]  and I think we have to look into that, too.
[50:56.960 --> 51:01.000]  Well, look at North Korea, isn't it wonderful communism's great, huh?
[51:01.000 --> 51:05.640]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[51:05.640 --> 51:10.400]  Human fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.

[52:50.240 --> 52:52.120]  you thousands of dollars today.
[52:52.120 --> 53:01.160]  That number again is 1-800-324-6554-800-324-6554, the bailout group.
[53:01.160 --> 53:06.160]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[53:06.160 --> 53:09.880]  may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[53:09.880 --> 53:14.920]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are
[53:14.920 --> 53:18.480]  just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[53:18.480 --> 53:23.000]  Remember how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[53:23.000 --> 53:24.000]  across America.
[53:24.000 --> 53:28.000]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[53:28.000 --> 53:31.640]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much
[53:31.640 --> 53:32.640]  healthier I feel.
[53:32.640 --> 53:35.320]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[53:35.320 --> 53:40.520]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[53:40.520 --> 53:43.040]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[53:43.040 --> 53:51.040]  Remember your two months supply today by calling 866-295-5305, that's 866-295-5305
[53:51.040 --> 54:15.040]  or order online, hbextract.com, heart and body extract, 866-295-5305 or hbextract.com.
[54:15.040 --> 54:21.040]  As the big New World Order global corporate faction that's slick, has the fancy PR, the
[54:21.040 --> 54:25.760]  high tech mind controlled, when you've got all these other backward states, most of them
[54:25.760 --> 54:30.720]  corrupt and abusive as well, but nothing like a threat that the globalists pose because
[54:30.720 --> 54:32.240]  they are scientific.
[54:32.240 --> 54:35.320]  They are the final revolution of tyranny over humanity.
[54:35.320 --> 54:39.040]  They must be defeated.
[54:39.040 --> 54:43.400]  And anything that's command and control, anything centralized as Carol Quigley's book, written
[54:43.400 --> 54:47.800]  for the CIA admits because they had to give it to their own State Department people to
[54:47.800 --> 54:53.000]  go here's how the world really works for their higher level operatives, was they work for
[54:53.000 --> 54:58.600]  anybody that centralizes the monopoly capitalists, the command and controllers, the crony capitalists
[54:58.600 --> 55:02.120]  are not capitalists, they're not free market.
[55:02.120 --> 55:05.600]  They use the boom bust business cycle to consolidate power.
[55:05.600 --> 55:06.600]  They're monopoly men.
[55:06.600 --> 55:11.480]  They use government to control people.
[55:11.480 --> 55:16.960]  That's why under Bush government triples under Obama, it doubles in the first couple months
[55:16.960 --> 55:18.400]  and he set to double it again.
[55:18.400 --> 55:23.640]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[55:23.640 --> 55:28.480]  Now I want to continue with your calls and then I'm going to get into the cop.
[55:28.480 --> 55:29.480]  I'm going to play this.
[55:29.480 --> 55:33.920]  We're going to go live in an hour and five minutes halfway into the next hour at prisonplanet.tv
[55:33.920 --> 55:40.640]  for the balance of the show, the last two and a half hours because what is on the squad
[55:40.640 --> 55:43.880]  career video is exactly what all the witnesses said.
[55:43.880 --> 55:47.800]  So what are the police do in their mental illness?
[55:47.800 --> 55:54.440]  First they say the video shows the EMT assaulting the officer, but the video shows the cop cussing
[55:54.440 --> 55:57.960]  at him, shoving him and grabbing him.
[55:57.960 --> 56:02.640]  Now they're in their mentally ill world and their upside down world, the EMT pulls his
[56:02.640 --> 56:14.880]  arm away and says, what's your problem because he's a man and he's dealing with a nut out
[56:14.880 --> 56:15.880]  of control.
[56:15.880 --> 56:17.840]  He was been in Iraq, pushing Iraq.
[56:17.840 --> 56:25.560]  He's around and thinks everybody's a slave and the cops are on Fox News now defending
[56:25.560 --> 56:28.960]  themselves saying it's great and the EMT needs to be charged.
[56:28.960 --> 56:32.600]  He did this quote dangerous to the public.
[56:32.600 --> 56:36.680]  So I'm going to go through the video piece by piece and break it down at prisonplanet.tv
[56:36.680 --> 56:38.240]  and piece by piece over the audio.
[56:38.240 --> 56:41.400]  Though guys, I forgot to tell you yesterday I meant to do this and I forgot.
[56:41.400 --> 56:45.920]  Will you get the clip, put it in a computer and cut out the cops, all the cops cussing.
[56:45.920 --> 56:47.560]  He cusses twice.
[56:47.560 --> 56:50.640]  The EMTs aren't cussing.
[56:50.640 --> 56:58.120]  He's like, listen, you bleep and piece of, you know, you piece of slave.
[56:58.120 --> 56:59.120]  Full delusion.
[56:59.120 --> 57:01.720]  You're like Kim Jong-il in North Korea.
[57:01.720 --> 57:03.920]  You are completely delusional.
[57:03.920 --> 57:07.400]  You think you can, but anyways, they lied and said that the ambulance wouldn't get out
[57:07.400 --> 57:08.400]  of their way.
[57:08.400 --> 57:09.400]  They're driving down the road.
[57:09.400 --> 57:13.000]  There's a rotten shoulder like there is in most areas of the country.
[57:13.000 --> 57:17.720]  There's about a two foot shoulder that's rotten, totally break into pieces.
[57:17.720 --> 57:19.920]  Here comes the cop at about 100.
[57:19.920 --> 57:22.360]  He slows down to about 80.
[57:22.360 --> 57:24.720]  The ambulance is going up, up a hill.
[57:24.720 --> 57:28.200]  The ambulance starts to get over and then swerves.
[57:28.200 --> 57:29.200]  You know why it swerved?
[57:29.200 --> 57:31.080]  There's a car broke down out in the highway.
[57:31.080 --> 57:33.880]  So the ambulance almost crashes into it at 60 miles an hour.
[57:33.880 --> 57:35.960]  The cop would have run over them.
[57:35.960 --> 57:38.080]  So adrenaline's flowing.
[57:38.080 --> 57:44.520]  The cop guns it and goes around, though we can't see around the ambulance.
[57:44.520 --> 57:47.160]  It's in Rolling Hills in Oklahoma.
[57:47.160 --> 57:49.400]  Psycho peck could have been a school bus, anything coming over.
[57:49.400 --> 57:57.560]  The psycho cop drives around him violently and then goes to some gas station where there
[57:57.560 --> 58:00.160]  was some minor call where a whole bunch of cops are stacked up.
[58:00.160 --> 58:04.080]  He pulls out in seconds.
[58:04.080 --> 58:05.280]  He's talking to somebody the whole time.
[58:05.280 --> 58:10.040]  It turns out it's his wife he's showing off for.
[58:10.040 --> 58:14.080]  Chases down the ambulance at speeds of over 80 miles an hour in a neighborhood on its
[58:14.080 --> 58:16.080]  way to the hospital.
[58:16.080 --> 58:19.800]  The cop starts screaming at the driver, the head EMT's in the back it's out and says,
[58:19.800 --> 58:23.680]  what's wrong, sir?
[58:23.680 --> 58:27.360]  He was respectful to the God, but that wasn't enough.
[58:27.360 --> 58:29.720]  More had to be given.
[58:29.720 --> 58:33.360]  And so we're going to the mind of a delusional state trooper and the delusional lawyer and
[58:33.360 --> 58:35.760]  the delusional state police.
[58:35.760 --> 58:41.680]  You guys are off your rockers and everybody sees it but you clowns.
[58:41.680 --> 58:50.720]  Thank you for listening to GCN, visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:50.720 --> 58:55.160]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[58:55.160 --> 58:56.160]  this summer.
[58:56.160 --> 59:00.040]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[59:00.040 --> 59:04.600]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[59:04.600 --> 59:05.840]  allows you to have.
[59:05.840 --> 59:11.000]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[59:11.000 --> 59:15.040]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[59:15.040 --> 59:17.520]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[59:17.520 --> 59:21.080]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[59:21.080 --> 59:24.760]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages.
[59:24.760 --> 59:29.280]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[59:29.280 --> 59:33.440]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[59:33.440 --> 59:35.120]  a long time sponsor of ours.
[59:35.120 --> 59:39.880]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[59:39.880 --> 59:45.840]  It's mysolarbackup.com, remember the government doesn't own the sun yet, so go to mysolarbackup.com
[59:45.840 --> 1:00:11.440]  or call toll-free 877-327-0365.
[1:00:11.440 --> 1:00:19.520]  Well, so does he, he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin,
[1:00:19.520 --> 1:00:23.840]  Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:23.840 --> 1:00:27.040]  Open phones coming up, I'm going to break down what's happening more in Iran, North
[1:00:27.040 --> 1:00:31.840]  Korea, what's going on with the economy, big stack of important news.
[1:00:31.840 --> 1:00:36.040]  Also, Trevor claims dashboard cam upholds his actions, totally insane.
[1:00:36.040 --> 1:00:40.640]  Also, let's cover that one, cops gets 40 months for beating up person in wheelchair.
[1:00:40.640 --> 1:00:42.040]  We're going to play that video too.
[1:00:42.040 --> 1:00:46.040]  They tried to defend that at first and said the person was arguing with them, which they're
[1:00:46.040 --> 1:00:47.040]  not.
[1:00:47.040 --> 1:00:48.040]  They go, get up.
[1:00:48.040 --> 1:00:49.040]  I can't, I'm paralyzed.
[1:00:49.040 --> 1:00:54.120]  I said get up, and they throw them out, break their bones, and laugh at them, and the person
[1:00:54.120 --> 1:00:55.120]  was a quadriplegic.
[1:00:55.120 --> 1:00:58.560]  And then the mentally ill scum tried to defend themselves.
[1:00:58.560 --> 1:01:03.480]  Look, you're only making it worse for yourself with your load of baloney, and this cop's
[1:01:03.480 --> 1:01:08.400]  lawyer's going, he was an Iraq veteran, and this is a dangerous EMT to the public and
[1:01:08.400 --> 1:01:13.880]  had to be dealt with, somebody that didn't follow the orders of an officer's dangerous
[1:01:13.880 --> 1:01:14.880]  orders.
[1:01:14.880 --> 1:01:20.080]  One of the cop pulled them over and said, Mo my lawn or stand on your head.
[1:01:20.080 --> 1:01:23.640]  You don't pull an ambulance over for trying to go to the hot.
[1:01:23.640 --> 1:01:25.160]  You tried to run them off the road.
[1:01:25.160 --> 1:01:26.160]  You lunatic.
[1:01:26.160 --> 1:01:30.760]  Well, wait till I play the video and for the radio audience, I'm going to break it down
[1:01:30.760 --> 1:01:34.440]  play by play.
[1:01:34.440 --> 1:01:35.440]  That's coming up.
[1:01:35.440 --> 1:01:36.440]  Let's go to your calls right now.
[1:01:36.440 --> 1:01:38.820]  Let's go to Tommy in Minnesota.
[1:01:38.820 --> 1:01:40.320]  You're on the air, Tommy.
[1:01:40.320 --> 1:01:41.320]  Hey, buddy.
[1:01:41.320 --> 1:01:42.320]  Hey, Alex.
[1:01:42.320 --> 1:01:45.120]  I love your show, and I got a two-part question.
[1:01:45.120 --> 1:01:51.480]  One is, if all we've done in America for the last 250 years is produce wealth or services
[1:01:51.480 --> 1:01:57.160]  to enhance that wealth, just how did we end up $57 trillion in debt with a $7.7 trillion
[1:01:57.160 --> 1:02:01.760]  money supply, and would you be willing to get Byron Dale, monetary expert as a guest
[1:02:01.760 --> 1:02:02.760]  on your show?
[1:02:02.760 --> 1:02:03.760]  Byron Dale.
[1:02:03.760 --> 1:02:07.480]  Byron Dale, I've heard that name.
[1:02:07.480 --> 1:02:12.040]  They've gotten us into debt from the greatest, wealthiest nation in 1913, and now the poorest,
[1:02:12.040 --> 1:02:16.800]  most in debt because the globalists used our wealth to buy off the world.
[1:02:16.800 --> 1:02:17.800]  Then they ran the wealth out.
[1:02:17.800 --> 1:02:21.240]  Now they're running up our credit card in our name, literally tens of trillions to buy
[1:02:21.240 --> 1:02:26.640]  everything up, leaving Northcom and paramilitary crazed brainwashed police on power trips
[1:02:26.640 --> 1:02:32.200]  as the rear guard to make sure they can carry out the looting properly.
[1:02:32.200 --> 1:02:36.240]  Then they're going to move on, and we'll just be a military jurisdiction that supplies
[1:02:36.240 --> 1:02:43.160]  dumb-down zombies for the global army, but that's how we got into this, was the private
[1:02:43.160 --> 1:02:45.560]  bankers took over and set up fractional reserve banking.
[1:02:45.560 --> 1:02:49.000]  You're absolutely correct about the fractional reserve banking, but if they were buying
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:52.760]  all this stuff from us, where would the debt actually come from in that situation?
[1:02:52.760 --> 1:02:56.040]  Well, they're not buying stuff from us.
[1:02:56.040 --> 1:02:58.160]  They've set up global mercantilism.
[1:02:58.160 --> 1:03:04.480]  Okay, but how exactly did they get us $57 trillion in debt if all we've done is produce
[1:03:04.480 --> 1:03:08.320]  wealth or services to enhance that wealth?
[1:03:08.320 --> 1:03:09.320]  Because we haven't.
[1:03:09.320 --> 1:03:13.400]  They created fractional reserve banking where interest is owed on the creation of money
[1:03:13.400 --> 1:03:14.720]  for the private banking families.
[1:03:14.720 --> 1:03:15.720]  It's a fraud.
[1:03:15.720 --> 1:03:17.560]  Yep, you're absolutely correct.
[1:03:17.560 --> 1:03:20.680]  And Russell L. Munk, General Counsel of the United States Treasury, said it, because I
[1:03:20.680 --> 1:03:21.680]  think said it best.
[1:03:21.680 --> 1:03:25.560]  He said the actual creation would always involve the extension of credit by private
[1:03:25.560 --> 1:03:27.720]  commercial banks.
[1:03:27.720 --> 1:03:29.120]  For 1913, it did.
[1:03:29.120 --> 1:03:33.920]  Yes, they, it's all, sure, I understand the Bank of England, I understand the Bank of
[1:03:33.920 --> 1:03:35.440]  England and the history of it.
[1:03:35.440 --> 1:03:36.440]  Yes.
[1:03:36.440 --> 1:03:39.520]  But my point is in the United States, and I know we had central banks that took over
[1:03:39.520 --> 1:03:43.160]  before that and were routed out by Andrew Jackson and others.
[1:03:43.160 --> 1:03:48.760]  Our entire history, our entire history is about a struggle against the private European
[1:03:48.760 --> 1:03:49.760]  banks coming in.
[1:03:49.760 --> 1:03:54.920]  And I appreciate your call with their sleight of hand fraud, it's total sleight of hand.
[1:03:54.920 --> 1:03:59.640]  They come in, they buy out the politicians, and they say, we're going to control the issue
[1:03:59.640 --> 1:04:01.760]  and the currency and credit.
[1:04:01.760 --> 1:04:05.800]  And then they buy the world up overnight, fraudulently.
[1:04:05.800 --> 1:04:07.760]  It's all a giant fraud.
[1:04:07.760 --> 1:04:12.120]  It's all a giant scam.
[1:04:12.120 --> 1:04:15.840]  And now they're telling you police beating up ambulance drivers is, is freedom and the
[1:04:15.840 --> 1:04:20.760]  ambulance driver is bad, but the ambulance driver lets them assault him and choke him
[1:04:20.760 --> 1:04:27.760]  and controls himself while they abuse him like psychopathic devils, like vampires on
[1:04:27.760 --> 1:04:31.560]  top of him, squeezing him, enjoying themselves, getting off on it.
[1:04:31.560 --> 1:04:33.080]  It's so disgusting.
[1:04:33.080 --> 1:04:40.480]  And then they go on TV and slander the poor EMTs, and they really believe it.
[1:04:40.480 --> 1:04:45.640]  That'd be like if you were going out in your backyard to grab one of your chickens and
[1:04:45.640 --> 1:04:48.200]  cut its head off and pluck it and it bit you.
[1:04:48.200 --> 1:04:52.080]  And you said, that darn chicken, it bit me, it didn't have a right to.
[1:04:52.080 --> 1:04:53.080]  And it really doesn't.
[1:04:53.080 --> 1:04:54.080]  It's your property.
[1:04:54.080 --> 1:04:55.480]  It's a slave.
[1:04:55.480 --> 1:05:00.720]  But human beings aren't slaves and aren't prey.
[1:05:00.720 --> 1:05:01.720]  Hello, friends.
[1:05:01.720 --> 1:05:02.720]  This is Alex Jones.
[1:05:02.720 --> 1:05:06.200]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more
[1:05:06.200 --> 1:05:07.200]  important than ever.
[1:05:07.200 --> 1:05:10.200]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[1:05:10.200 --> 1:05:12.960]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line until you have your own bread.
[1:05:12.960 --> 1:05:17.000]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family.
[1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:20.920]  In any emergency, if you simply prepare, no one is going to take care of your family in
[1:05:20.920 --> 1:05:22.520]  the final equation but you.

[1:06:01.520 --> 1:06:07.600]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:06:07.600 --> 1:06:12.120]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[1:06:12.120 --> 1:06:13.440]  us would like to see.
[1:06:13.440 --> 1:06:18.600]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[1:06:18.600 --> 1:06:19.600]  of the American people.
[1:06:19.600 --> 1:06:24.360]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[1:06:24.360 --> 1:06:29.480]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[1:06:29.480 --> 1:06:37.600]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[1:06:37.600 --> 1:06:41.160]  It's not about left to right, it's about a one-world government.
[1:06:41.160 --> 1:06:48.040]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[1:07:00.960 --> 1:07:05.280]  You've probably heard about the incredible, powerful, and natural antioxidants found in
[1:07:05.280 --> 1:07:06.280]  red wine.
[1:07:06.280 --> 1:07:10.600]  Unfortunately, not everyone is able to drink a glass of wine each day.
[1:07:10.600 --> 1:07:15.120]  But now, you don't have to drink even a single drop, thanks to New Rev.

[1:07:25.440 --> 1:07:30.920]  down the aging process, help you lose weight, override an unhealthy lifestyle, boost your

[1:08:02.280 --> 1:08:08.840]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[1:08:08.840 --> 1:08:14.960]  It's Alex Jones, and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:08:14.960 --> 1:08:19.160]  You know, this has been out since the last Friday, and I just made the point that the
[1:08:19.160 --> 1:08:25.800]  police did lie and say that the EMT assaulted them, and the video came out, and he just
[1:08:25.800 --> 1:08:31.120]  politely said, hey, let's go into the hospital, and you can arrest us and be the big man there.
[1:08:31.120 --> 1:08:35.760]  He didn't even say it like that, he said, listen, sir, this woman, they thought she
[1:08:35.760 --> 1:08:38.400]  was having a heart attack, it turned out she'd had a heat stroke.
[1:08:38.400 --> 1:08:44.760]  He said, listen, ma'am, sir, I've got a lady in here with trouble, she's hurt, and I've
[1:08:44.760 --> 1:08:49.600]  got to get to the hospital, can you just give us the ticket and arrest us there, please?
[1:08:49.600 --> 1:08:53.280]  And he just screams at him and says, you get in that, back in that vehicle, and he said,
[1:08:53.280 --> 1:08:56.600]  no, I'm not going to let you talk to us like that, he goes, I'm going to arrest you.
[1:08:56.600 --> 1:09:01.760]  He said, arrest me at the hospital, I've been an EMT for 20 years, and he starts cussing
[1:09:01.760 --> 1:09:06.440]  at the driver, and he says, don't talk to my driver that way.
[1:09:06.440 --> 1:09:13.040]  See, we are human, our forefathers mattered, we aren't your slaves, you little out of control
[1:09:13.040 --> 1:09:19.520]  thug, your banker masters have stolen the country, blind, your masters ship in the
[1:09:19.520 --> 1:09:22.840]  heroin and cocaine, and I don't care if you deny it all day.
[1:09:22.840 --> 1:09:29.240]  And I know a million, 300,000 Iraqis went down to you boys, and I know you're used to
[1:09:29.240 --> 1:09:33.640]  bathing in people's blood, but I'm giving you a news flash here, we're not your slaves,
[1:09:33.640 --> 1:09:37.880]  you understand that?
[1:09:37.880 --> 1:09:42.480]  So that's coming up, because these guys have gone completely nuts, they're on TV defending
[1:09:42.480 --> 1:09:46.080]  themselves calling the EMT dangerous, and we're going to go through all the video, the
[1:09:46.080 --> 1:09:49.000]  unedited video.
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:53.120]  Now this is from the squad car, have next the actual choking video from the cell phone
[1:09:53.120 --> 1:09:57.800]  on the other side of the car, then we'll cut to him choking the black guy and him putting
[1:09:57.800 --> 1:09:58.800]  up with it.
[1:09:58.800 --> 1:10:06.040]  That's the assault is a cop choking you, because they're nuts and pulled an ambulance over.
[1:10:06.040 --> 1:10:12.160]  I mean nuts, folks, he almost runs the ambulance into a car stalled in the breakdown lane hanging
[1:10:12.160 --> 1:10:20.120]  out in the road, they almost all die, because a nutcase driving around like a maniac.
[1:10:20.120 --> 1:10:24.000]  And I guess that cop would have been a lot happier if he'd had the ambulance hit the
[1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:27.200]  oncoming traffic, maybe he'd have pulled off, he'd have got out, it'd have been no big deal,
[1:10:27.200 --> 1:10:31.000]  there was dead ambulance drivers and people everywhere, and a dead family, but we're so
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  sick of you, you're out of control thugs, you know, you look at those North Korean police
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:40.400]  on their power trips, look at the citizens like they're slaves, or Chinese police video
[1:10:40.400 --> 1:10:44.640]  there on power trips, you look just like them, you're drunk with power and you make this
[1:10:44.640 --> 1:10:52.840]  country look bad and you disgrace our founding fathers, you're pathetic.
[1:10:52.840 --> 1:10:57.040]  Somebody who's given real authority and is a true guardian doesn't act like an out of
[1:10:57.040 --> 1:11:04.240]  control power tripping thug, with great power comes great responsibility, and you're out
[1:11:04.240 --> 1:11:05.240]  of your mind.
[1:11:05.240 --> 1:11:15.520]  Anyways, that's coming up, this makes me sick, just an arrogant, self-righteous fool.
[1:11:15.520 --> 1:11:17.520]  Aaron in Missouri, you're on the air, go ahead.
[1:11:17.520 --> 1:11:19.520]  Alex, my friend, how are you doing?
[1:11:19.520 --> 1:11:20.520]  Good sir, welcome.
[1:11:20.520 --> 1:11:21.520]  Welcome.
[1:11:21.520 --> 1:11:30.720]  Yeah, I'm kind of blown away by your David Ike interview, because I've been waiting about
[1:11:30.720 --> 1:11:38.640]  two months to call in on that subject of the nature of reality and consciousness and what
[1:11:38.640 --> 1:11:45.600]  not, because about two months ago, I came across a YouTube series of videos by a guy
[1:11:45.600 --> 1:11:57.680]  named Jonathan, and it goes by a user named Adam Pants 2007, Adam Pants 2008, and he went
[1:11:57.680 --> 1:12:04.040]  through all of that, and I wanted to call in to your show and bring it up, but I had
[1:12:04.040 --> 1:12:08.240]  the feeling that it would come up soon or something, and it blew me away when you guys
[1:12:08.240 --> 1:12:09.480]  were talking about that.
[1:12:09.480 --> 1:12:14.200]  Well, again, I agree with about 98% of what David Ike says, he's a very intelligent person,
[1:12:14.200 --> 1:12:16.240]  and he may be right about the other 2%.
[1:12:16.240 --> 1:12:22.960]  The issue is, I'm not talking about David Ike and Reptilian Space aliens, we have, and
[1:12:22.960 --> 1:12:26.880]  we go live at prisonplanet.tv later, I'll put it up on screen for people, off of major
[1:12:26.880 --> 1:12:28.040]  university websites.
[1:12:28.040 --> 1:12:34.680]  We have really four brains that are all interconnected, okay, kind of like you have a hard drive in
[1:12:34.680 --> 1:12:39.560]  the processor and in other parts of a regular computer, you've got the brainstem that does
[1:12:39.560 --> 1:12:46.400]  heartbeat and respiration and basic things like that, and where the nerves come in on
[1:12:46.400 --> 1:12:54.760]  a spinal cord, and then you've got other parts of the brain that hook into the cerebral cortex
[1:12:54.760 --> 1:13:02.320]  that run hearing and smell and taste, and then those are all driven by the Reptilian brain,
[1:13:02.320 --> 1:13:07.720]  which is identical to large reptile brains, I mean, it's the same thing, and it's got
[1:13:07.720 --> 1:13:14.840]  like the fight and flight and sex and money and food and desires, a bestial, you know,
[1:13:14.840 --> 1:13:18.800]  things of the flesh, and then there's other parts of the brain that are connected to the
[1:13:18.800 --> 1:13:24.640]  spiritual realm and to things that are interpreted that way, at least, and the cerebral cortex,
[1:13:24.640 --> 1:13:30.040]  and on the frontal lobes, analyzes all of that and condenses the great data down to a point
[1:13:30.040 --> 1:13:33.440]  so we can focus and integrate all the other processors.
[1:13:33.440 --> 1:13:37.120]  So people are emailing me saying, you're saying that we have a reptile brain and that we really
[1:13:37.120 --> 1:13:38.120]  are aliens?
[1:13:38.120 --> 1:13:45.080]  No, I'm not saying that, I'm going off of Grey's Anatomy and university websites that
[1:13:45.080 --> 1:13:51.320]  the reptilian area of the brain, that's what I'm talking about, I'm talking about a sector
[1:13:51.320 --> 1:13:52.960]  of the overall brain.
[1:13:52.960 --> 1:13:57.640]  The brain is a group of different operating systems together, so that's what I was talking
[1:13:57.640 --> 1:13:58.640]  about.
[1:13:58.640 --> 1:14:06.160]  About, it blew me away, you know, I knew all that, you know, the subconscious mind and
[1:14:06.160 --> 1:14:09.840]  the subliminal that he was talking about, and that's how you've got to break people
[1:14:09.840 --> 1:14:13.320]  out of a lot of this is by showing them the subliminals, because they're going to want
[1:14:13.320 --> 1:14:18.120]  to know why 6-6-6 is all over everything, they want to know why God lies and Satan is
[1:14:18.120 --> 1:14:22.920]  good and things are on covers, and once you tune into this consciousness, you can see
[1:14:22.920 --> 1:14:23.920]  this stuff.
[1:14:23.920 --> 1:14:24.920]  A lot clearer.
[1:14:24.920 --> 1:14:29.240]  Well, no, it's just like what David said, when you see one of those pictures that has
[1:14:29.240 --> 1:14:34.120]  a subliminal, once you've seen the subliminal and it pointed out, that's all you see, and
[1:14:34.120 --> 1:14:40.680]  it's just like once you see something in life, once you've learned about something, or once
[1:14:40.680 --> 1:14:43.920]  you've learned somebody's lied to you, it's never the same.
[1:14:43.920 --> 1:14:44.920]  Go ahead.
[1:14:44.920 --> 1:14:50.880]  And when you were talking about how you felt like everybody is, you know, somewhat like
[1:14:50.880 --> 1:14:56.200]  a symbiote to each other, you know, this series of videos covers all that, and it's
[1:14:56.200 --> 1:15:01.040]  just like what Christ was saying when he said, you know, you've got to love your enemies,
[1:15:01.040 --> 1:15:06.600]  because that goes with it, because if you hurt somebody else, you're hurting yourself,
[1:15:06.600 --> 1:15:08.600]  because we're all tied into this.
[1:15:08.600 --> 1:15:09.600]  Absolutely.
[1:15:09.600 --> 1:15:10.600]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[1:15:10.600 --> 1:15:11.600]  I've got to jump.
[1:15:11.600 --> 1:15:12.600]  I want to get other people in here, and thank you.
[1:15:12.600 --> 1:15:14.240]  Bob in Ohio, you're on the air.
[1:15:14.240 --> 1:15:15.240]  Go ahead.
[1:15:15.240 --> 1:15:22.400]  Well, God bless the non-Vet in his 60s, and you are one of my heroes, Alex, I'm praying
[1:15:22.400 --> 1:15:23.840]  for you all the time.
[1:15:23.840 --> 1:15:24.840]  Well, thank you.
[1:15:24.840 --> 1:15:30.360]  God bless all you folks, and you're among many, and you're not alone, and I want you
[1:15:30.360 --> 1:15:31.360]  to remember that.
[1:15:31.360 --> 1:15:32.360]  Well, thank you, sir.
[1:15:32.360 --> 1:15:34.360]  What's on your mind?
[1:15:34.360 --> 1:15:42.440]  I've heard no speech about the hydrogen cars, and that was one of our deals that we could
[1:15:42.440 --> 1:15:46.640]  have got gone to put the oil companies in their place.
[1:15:46.640 --> 1:15:48.640]  What happened to hydrogen cars?
[1:15:48.640 --> 1:15:54.240]  Well, they're going to bring out limited ones that are still based on technologies developed.
[1:15:54.240 --> 1:15:58.160]  Under this fake green revolution, they're only going to develop certain technologies
[1:15:58.160 --> 1:16:02.880]  that allow certain globalist companies to control the development of new systems while
[1:16:02.880 --> 1:16:07.080]  they suppress a lot of the other technologies that have been developed, and what they're
[1:16:07.080 --> 1:16:12.320]  going to do is not really allow new technologies that will really work well to be developed.
[1:16:12.320 --> 1:16:14.920]  They're suppressing those on record.
[1:16:14.920 --> 1:16:20.060]  While using as an excuse to clamp down and tax and regulate and control the existing
[1:16:20.060 --> 1:16:24.360]  technologies that are out there, so it's a type of feudalism or serfdom control coming
[1:16:24.360 --> 1:16:25.360]  in.
[1:16:25.360 --> 1:16:30.760]  You didn't know, once in a while, you're going to get a beavis and butt head, real don't
[1:16:30.760 --> 1:16:32.520]  call you, don't let it rub you.
[1:16:32.520 --> 1:16:33.960]  All right, God bless you, my friend.
[1:16:33.960 --> 1:16:34.960]  I appreciate that.
[1:16:34.960 --> 1:16:36.760]  I'm going to hear from you, Bob.
[1:16:36.760 --> 1:16:38.760]  Tim in Ohio, you're on the air.
[1:16:38.760 --> 1:16:39.760]  Hi, Alex.
[1:16:39.760 --> 1:16:40.760]  Hey, Tim.
[1:16:40.760 --> 1:16:46.760]  In the wake of ABC announcing its plans to broadcast from the White House, I have the
[1:16:46.760 --> 1:16:48.760]  perfect clip for you today.
[1:16:48.760 --> 1:16:53.320]  Last we talked, I played you some Scarface, and you had requested some from Network Howard
[1:16:53.320 --> 1:16:56.760]  Beal, and I would like to forward the balance of my time.
[1:16:56.760 --> 1:17:00.560]  It runs 147, and the out cue is turn them off.
[1:17:00.560 --> 1:17:04.920]  Hey, I'll tell you what I'd rather hear is that Scarface again with all the cuss words
[1:17:04.920 --> 1:17:05.920]  cut out.
[1:17:05.920 --> 1:17:06.920]  You have that ready?
[1:17:06.920 --> 1:17:08.920]  Not ready, but I can get it.
[1:17:08.920 --> 1:17:09.920]  Okay.
[1:17:09.920 --> 1:17:11.920]  I worked real hard on this Howard Beal bill for you.
[1:17:11.920 --> 1:17:12.920]  All right.
[1:17:12.920 --> 1:17:13.920]  Let me hear it.
[1:17:13.920 --> 1:17:14.920]  All right.
[1:17:14.920 --> 1:17:15.920]  Here it comes.
[1:17:15.920 --> 1:17:16.920]  Drumroll.
[1:17:16.920 --> 1:17:20.920]  I don't have to tell you things are bad.
[1:17:20.920 --> 1:17:22.920]  Everybody knows things are bad.
[1:17:22.920 --> 1:17:23.920]  It's a depression.
[1:17:23.920 --> 1:17:27.920]  Everybody's out of work or scared of losing their job.
[1:17:27.920 --> 1:17:29.920]  The dollar by the nickel's worth.
[1:17:29.920 --> 1:17:33.920]  Thanks to going bust shop, give a stupid duck under the counter.
[1:17:33.920 --> 1:17:37.920]  You know, the air is unfit to breathe, and our food is unfit to eat.
[1:17:37.920 --> 1:17:42.920]  We stick watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us that today we had 15
[1:17:42.920 --> 1:17:44.920]  homeless eyes and 63 violent crimes.
[1:17:44.920 --> 1:17:49.920]  But if that's the way it's supposed to be, we know things are bad, worse than bad.
[1:17:49.920 --> 1:17:50.920]  They're crazy.
[1:17:50.920 --> 1:17:52.920]  Well, I'm not going to leave you alone.
[1:17:52.920 --> 1:17:54.920]  I want you to get mad.
[1:17:54.920 --> 1:17:56.920]  You've got to say I'm a human being.
[1:17:56.920 --> 1:17:57.920]  Right.
[1:17:57.920 --> 1:17:58.920]  Life has value.
[1:17:58.920 --> 1:18:01.920]  So, I want you to get up now.
[1:18:01.920 --> 1:18:05.920]  I want all of you to get up out of your chair.
[1:18:05.920 --> 1:18:07.920]  I want you to get up right now.
[1:18:07.920 --> 1:18:09.920]  Go to the window.
[1:18:09.920 --> 1:18:10.920]  Open it.
[1:18:10.920 --> 1:18:12.920]  Stick your head out and yell.
[1:18:12.920 --> 1:18:16.920]  I'm not going to say this anymore.
[1:18:16.920 --> 1:18:19.920]  You're never going to get any truth from us.
[1:18:19.920 --> 1:18:21.920]  We'll tell you anything you want to hear.
[1:18:21.920 --> 1:18:22.920]  We lie like hell.
[1:18:22.920 --> 1:18:25.920]  We'll tell you anything you want to hear.
[1:18:25.920 --> 1:18:27.920]  We get an illusion, man.
[1:18:27.920 --> 1:18:29.920]  None of it is true.
[1:18:29.920 --> 1:18:32.920]  Don't make me believe the illusion we're spending here.
[1:18:32.920 --> 1:18:36.920]  You're not going to believe that the truth is reality and that your own lives are unreal.
[1:18:36.920 --> 1:18:37.920]  You do.
[1:18:37.920 --> 1:18:39.920]  Whatever the truth tells you, you're just like a tube.
[1:18:39.920 --> 1:18:40.920]  You're just like a tube.
[1:18:40.920 --> 1:18:42.920]  You're a vegetarian like a tube.
[1:18:42.920 --> 1:18:44.920]  You even drink like a tube.
[1:18:44.920 --> 1:18:46.920]  This is much madness.
[1:18:46.920 --> 1:18:47.920]  You maniac.
[1:18:47.920 --> 1:18:48.920]  It's God's name.
[1:18:48.920 --> 1:18:50.920]  You people are the real thing.
[1:18:50.920 --> 1:18:52.920]  We are the illusion.
[1:18:52.920 --> 1:18:54.920]  So, turn off your television.
[1:18:54.920 --> 1:18:56.920]  Turn them off now.
[1:18:56.920 --> 1:18:57.920]  Turn them off right now.
[1:18:57.920 --> 1:18:59.920]  Turn them off and leave them off.
[1:18:59.920 --> 1:19:02.920]  All right, all right, all right.
[1:19:02.920 --> 1:19:08.920]  Listen, listen, I appreciate that call, Tim, but the music's a bit loud in my humble opinion.
[1:19:08.920 --> 1:19:14.920]  But, yes, turning off the mainstream media is important at first so that you get away from it
[1:19:14.920 --> 1:19:17.920]  and get out of one of their illusion and then later tune back in.
[1:19:17.920 --> 1:19:19.920]  And it's like a cartoon.
[1:19:19.920 --> 1:19:22.920]  It's so ridiculous and over the top and obvious manipulation.
[1:19:22.920 --> 1:19:27.920]  But people who for decades have just been watching and getting deeper and deeper into it,
[1:19:27.920 --> 1:19:30.920]  they don't realize they're being played for fools.
[1:19:30.920 --> 1:19:33.920]  But absolutely good to hear from you.
[1:19:33.920 --> 1:19:39.920]  All right, when we get back, Michael, Jamie, Dan, many others, 1-800-25-99-231,
[1:19:39.920 --> 1:19:44.920]  and we're only about 13, 14 minutes away from me breaking down the dash cam video.
[1:19:44.920 --> 1:19:47.920]  And it's not just about the cop attack and the ambulance.
[1:19:47.920 --> 1:19:50.920]  It's about them saying that the ambulance driver's bad.
[1:19:50.920 --> 1:19:54.920]  See, they really believe their tyranny is good.
[1:19:54.920 --> 1:19:57.920]  He's as crazy as a bloody March Hare.
[1:19:57.920 --> 1:20:26.920]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.

[1:21:04.920 --> 1:21:09.920]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[1:21:09.920 --> 1:21:12.920]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[1:21:12.920 --> 1:21:18.920]  Could their objective be world domination?
[1:21:18.920 --> 1:21:28.920]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:21:28.920 --> 1:21:34.920]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[1:21:41.920 --> 1:21:45.920]  They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power.

[1:24:25.920 --> 1:24:31.920]  Taken on the fight, I said I'll never give it up.
[1:24:31.920 --> 1:24:47.920]  Stand tall, I'm getting up on the calipole.
[1:24:47.920 --> 1:24:52.920]  Ha ha ha ha!
[1:24:52.920 --> 1:24:57.920]  You're singing like a fool because all it takes is you and I.
[1:24:57.920 --> 1:25:06.920]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live. The Liberty Engine is cranking up like 500 horsepower.
[1:25:06.920 --> 1:25:13.920]  A maximum performance piercing the night.
[1:25:13.920 --> 1:25:25.920]  I can hear the roar of Liberty as the great forges are fired up.
[1:25:25.920 --> 1:25:33.920]  Let's continue with your phone calls. Let's talk to Michael in Florida. You're on the air. Welcome.
[1:25:33.920 --> 1:25:35.920]  How are you doing?
[1:25:35.920 --> 1:25:36.920]  Welcome.
[1:25:36.920 --> 1:25:43.920]  Yeah, well, I wanted to say before I got started that, you know, thanks for all the effort that you're doing to inform all of us.
[1:25:43.920 --> 1:25:52.920]  You know, a lot of us had a week and upward. This is no way we're going to be able to comprehend the amount of risk that you're taking to get us this information, but thank you.
[1:25:52.920 --> 1:25:59.920]  I'm saying Geronimo, baby, already jumped a long time ago, and I'm just hoping it's a soft landing. It's a good feeling to be committed.
[1:25:59.920 --> 1:26:07.920]  Yeah, it is. I wanted to share a piece of information before I talk to you about some of the issues regarding the cops and stuff and what's happening.
[1:26:07.920 --> 1:26:17.920]  For those of you that want to find information regarding what bills are being introduced by the senators and representatives of your country,
[1:26:17.920 --> 1:26:30.920]  go to congress.org. If you click on the bill section, you can track all the bills that they're proposing, all the ones that have been passed, and all the ones that are currently being voted on.
[1:26:30.920 --> 1:26:37.920]  Though more and more, they're making bills secret that are nonnational security related.
[1:26:37.920 --> 1:26:47.920]  I mean, this is just the tip of the iceberg, at least, and it gives people a chance to see what's happening in the government and what bills are trying to pass to strip away their rights and what else is happening.
[1:26:47.920 --> 1:27:02.920]  Yeah, well, I mean, what's happening is they're going for broke. They've already committed so many incredible crimes that it's reached flashpoint, and they've just decided to go completely wild, hardcore tyranny, and everybody better watch out.
[1:27:02.920 --> 1:27:07.920]  Because this is for real, and the right thing is on. We are being right big time. Thank you, Michael.
[1:27:07.920 --> 1:27:14.920]  Jamie in New York, you're on the year worldwide. Hello, Jamie. Come on down.
[1:27:14.920 --> 1:27:15.920]  Hey, how are you, Alex?
[1:27:15.920 --> 1:27:16.920]  Hey, Jamie.
[1:27:16.920 --> 1:27:24.920]  How's it going? Just wanted to first off say, you and your team, great job. You guys are an awesome help in helping to wake the rest.
[1:27:24.920 --> 1:27:26.920]  Thank you, my friend. So are you. Go ahead.
[1:27:26.920 --> 1:27:47.920]  Two quick things. First, the entire analog digital TV signal switch that's being pushed so hard by the powers that be. That's just so odd to me in regards to the spectrum of radio frequency that's going to be abandoned due to it and how that's being bought up by cell phone companies and whatnot.
[1:27:47.920 --> 1:27:48.920]  What do you think about that?
[1:27:48.920 --> 1:28:04.920]  Well, there's there's many different facets to that. And I don't know which one is most important in order. But number one, by making radio and TV convert to the digital, those are new patented systems.
[1:28:04.920 --> 1:28:19.920]  But in some cases cost 20 times. In most cases, it's about four times that I've seen them report what the old non digital signals and so a lot of small AM and FM stations will have them at first.
[1:28:19.920 --> 1:28:26.920]  And then a lot of UHF VHF are going dark because they couldn't afford it.
[1:28:26.920 --> 1:28:37.920]  Also, yes, those spectrums are being gathered up instead of the citizenry or local community being given dibs on those radio and TV spectrums and signals.
[1:28:37.920 --> 1:28:51.920]  It's also select corporations are being given larger pieces of the new digital spectrum to further consolidate, you know, the old rules where the companies couldn't own a majority of the transmitters in a local or the majority of channels.
[1:28:51.920 --> 1:28:56.920]  But then also mind controls real flicker rates are real.
[1:28:56.920 --> 1:29:07.920]  Subliminal messaging is real. There's a lot of different tactics they use and it's been proven that the high def TVs are much more devastating on people sucking them in for programming.
[1:29:07.920 --> 1:29:13.920]  And if you go to the UT psychology department or any other big psychology department, most of it isn't about teaching students.
[1:29:13.920 --> 1:29:25.920]  It's DARPA funding and Homeland Security funding and it's all about a whole floor I saw years ago was just about flicker rates for monkeys testing how to put monkeys into a mesmerized state.
[1:29:25.920 --> 1:29:28.920]  And so, yes, they are mind controlling people with it.
[1:29:28.920 --> 1:29:31.920]  And a lot more, my friend.
[1:29:31.920 --> 1:29:32.920]  Anything else?
[1:29:32.920 --> 1:29:39.920]  I hear the music. Another thing quick clip. I don't know if you've heard about Microsoft's project natal.
[1:29:39.920 --> 1:29:43.920]  Now, I've heard a little bit. Hey, what I got to go to this next clip.
[1:29:43.920 --> 1:29:50.920]  But if you can hold, I'll get back to you in four wars dot com prison money dot TV, the website. Stay with us.
[1:29:50.920 --> 1:29:59.920]  We're on the March, the empires on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[1:30:59.920 --> 1:31:06.920]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:31:06.920 --> 1:31:13.920]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[1:31:13.920 --> 1:31:20.920]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[1:31:20.920 --> 1:31:25.920]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[1:31:25.920 --> 1:31:36.920]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[1:31:36.920 --> 1:31:40.920]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[1:31:40.920 --> 1:31:47.920]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told and his real agenda.
[1:31:47.920 --> 1:31:55.920]  A short copy of the Obama deception today at info wars dot com or downloaded in super high quality at presentplanet.tv.
[1:31:55.920 --> 1:32:21.920]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[1:32:21.920 --> 1:32:31.920]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[1:32:31.920 --> 1:32:41.920]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[1:32:41.920 --> 1:33:01.920]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[1:33:01.920 --> 1:33:11.920]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[1:33:11.920 --> 1:33:21.920]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[1:33:21.920 --> 1:33:31.920]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[1:33:31.920 --> 1:33:51.920]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[1:33:51.920 --> 1:34:19.920]  Look at this article from Fox News, has a disgusting headline where the lawyer for the cop that attacked repeatedly and choked a veteran EMT driver with no criminal record and all these great citations for his work.
[1:34:19.920 --> 1:34:29.920]  Now, they assault him on the video, not just the cell phone camera video, but now the dash cam video.
[1:34:29.920 --> 1:34:41.920]  Trooper claims dash cam upload that everybody's now seen on the web validates him.
[1:34:41.920 --> 1:34:49.920]  The headline trooper claims dash board cam upholds his actions. This is their craziness.
[1:34:49.920 --> 1:35:09.920]  But before I get to that and break down the mental illness of the establishment, we're now violently pulling over a ambulance with a woman who thinks she's having a heart attack, turned out she'd had heat stroke, going to the hospital and then assaulting the EMTs for no reason.
[1:35:09.920 --> 1:35:19.920]  This is supposedly normal, but I wanted to just of the hundreds of clips we have that document how the police have gone insane.
[1:35:19.920 --> 1:35:30.920]  Cop gets 40 months for beating man in a wheelchair. I'm surprised they didn't claim he was talking back and that it was a danger to the public because that's what they say in this article.
[1:35:30.920 --> 1:35:36.920]  They say the EMT was talking back to the officer and that was a danger to the public, so he deserved what happened to him.
[1:35:36.920 --> 1:35:43.920]  Well, I guess this person in a wheelchair was talking back and I've got a bunch of videos of somebody in a wheelchair and they'll say get up and the person says I'm paralyzed.
[1:35:43.920 --> 1:35:55.920]  They just throw them out and start beating them. In a rare instance, and it is rare, of justice, a Chicago cop received a sentence of more than three years in prison for mercilessly beating a man shackled to a wheelchair.
[1:35:55.920 --> 1:36:12.920]  The officer thug was caught on a surveillance video pummeling the man like something out of an evil torture chamber, the brutal cop, William Cozy cuffed the victim's legs with a wheelchair and then struck him with a SAP.
[1:36:12.920 --> 1:36:19.920]  He let whatever a sap is. He later said the man attacked him, but the video shows otherwise. They always do that.
[1:36:19.920 --> 1:36:29.920]  Now, the new thing is if a cop says they're forced to punch you in the face, they will say that you assaulted them.
[1:36:29.920 --> 1:36:37.920]  And I've seen video after video of people not doing this and they'll say it.
[1:36:37.920 --> 1:36:44.920]  And all these videos are coming out now. People have hidden cameras in their house. A cop's planting drugs and going, oh, just found drugs. You're going to jail.
[1:36:44.920 --> 1:36:53.920]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, here in Texas, and I'd say half the small towns, they just pull you over and take everything you got and it's on the news and the cops go on the news and go, yeah, we take your money here.
[1:36:53.920 --> 1:37:05.920]  Don't come through the town. I mean, and now they want to have databases where if you've criticized the police, say Texas is trying to pass this law, it's on their dash computers with automatic cameras that read all the plates when you come through town.
[1:37:05.920 --> 1:37:16.920]  They go, oh, look, Alex Jones talked about about us. He's going to be passing through the light in about a minute. Oh, hell, let me pull out of McDonald's and go over there. Get out of your car, Jones. I'm taking everything you got.
[1:37:16.920 --> 1:37:27.920]  And that's how Texas just operates now out in the open and the cops go and see it and go, we can take whatever we want. Yeah, I keep the money. Yeah, we don't have to find drugs on you.
[1:37:27.920 --> 1:37:40.920]  I mean, this is the craziness that's going on. So let's go ahead with audio. Show the video of them beating someone in a wheelchair. One of many.
[1:37:40.920 --> 1:37:46.920]  This isn't the one where they tell them, get up the person's quadripleasing and cancel. They throw them out, breaking their bones and then laugh at them. Here it is.
[1:37:46.920 --> 1:37:58.920]  This is an American hospital for a stab wound. Officer William Cosy can be seen handcuffing Miles to the wheelchair and then repeatedly punching him. Authorities say with a blackjack or small baton.
[1:37:58.920 --> 1:38:09.920]  The security video has no audio, but was evidence enough for the police department to suspend Cosy for two years. The city also settled with the victim for $125,000.
[1:38:09.920 --> 1:38:21.920]  No one deserves what took place on that video unless there was some sort of force or harm that was threatened. Okay, that's enough.
[1:38:21.920 --> 1:38:35.920]  Now, now, now, according to that, so in fact, YouTube, another one crippled thrown out a wheelchair, I think should bring it up or jail guard throws person on a wheelchair.
[1:38:35.920 --> 1:38:48.920]  Now, this person's paralyzed chest down and they say get up and they say, I can, I'm paralyzed and they dump them out breaking the person's legs because when you've been paralyzed a long time, your legs turn into like chalk, your muscles turn into like jello.
[1:38:48.920 --> 1:38:56.920]  And then it's just funny. You know, the person in their urine and feces on the ground and they kind of have a devilish celebration.
[1:38:56.920 --> 1:39:03.920]  The police, by the way, defended that case and said, Yeah, no, person didn't get up. Doesn't matter if you're paralyzed. You don't follow an order. We break your legs.
[1:39:03.920 --> 1:39:13.920]  See, it's a mental illness of the code says he didn't follow an order, but he couldn't. Doesn't matter. Your legs get broken.
[1:39:13.920 --> 1:39:21.920]  Now, the reason I wanted to go over that is this is the mental illness that we're talking about. I mean, this has reached craziness potential.
[1:39:21.920 --> 1:39:33.920]  Fox News trooper claims dashboard cam upholds his actions for more than three weeks. An infamous cell phone video showing an Oklahoma highway patrolman and a paramedic getting into a scuffle.
[1:39:33.920 --> 1:39:41.920]  The black guy didn't touch him. The paramedic didn't touch him. They're grabbing, pushing, hitting on him. He pulls an arm away. They call that attacking him.
[1:39:41.920 --> 1:39:46.920]  You know, just in fact, they now charge you if you raise your hand when you're being beaten. That's assault on a God.
[1:39:46.920 --> 1:39:53.920]  I mean, this is God levels. He'll be wearing gold crowns. We'll have to bow when we see them. I mean, it's really mentally ill.
[1:39:53.920 --> 1:40:01.920]  As they take the mental patients that have been in Iraq, but they're doing all that evil and they take them here. This is called tyranny, folks.
[1:40:01.920 --> 1:40:08.920]  Now it's counterpart video from the troopers dashboard cam has been released in summer saying it vindicates a decorated war hero.
[1:40:08.920 --> 1:40:16.920]  So see, this is ultimate spin. The video clearly shows the cop out of control, but they've got such arrogance. They'll they'll say it defends him.
[1:40:16.920 --> 1:40:22.920]  We're going to show you that video unedited other than some cuss words cut out.
[1:40:22.920 --> 1:40:28.920]  That's coming up, but don't go to it yet because I want to go through this whole video and leave his audio up while I'm talking.
[1:40:28.920 --> 1:40:36.920]  I want to pause it as we go through it and break down. I'm going to read this account of them telling people what it says and only showing short clips on Fox.
[1:40:36.920 --> 1:40:40.920]  Now I'm going to show you the unedited video and you decide what's the truth.
[1:40:40.920 --> 1:40:45.920]  Okay. He is not this org.
[1:40:45.920 --> 1:40:51.920]  Yes, that means a goblin. This constitutional depriver of people's rights. He's a good man.
[1:40:51.920 --> 1:40:56.920]  This is a man that has been in law enforcement, a longer piece officer for 15 years.
[1:40:56.920 --> 1:41:02.920]  He just got back from Iraq, got back in April this year after terror duty for the U.S. Navy.
[1:41:02.920 --> 1:41:09.920]  So attorney Mark James, who came to the defense of his client, Trooper Daniel Martin at a press conference Monday afternoon.
[1:41:09.920 --> 1:41:18.920]  James claims the dashboard camera upholds his client's story, showing that he acted appropriately in subduing paramedic Maurice White.
[1:41:18.920 --> 1:41:28.920]  Subduing. White's going, sir, let us just get to the to the hospital and you can arrest us or take it as this woman is having a heart attack right here.
[1:41:28.920 --> 1:41:33.920]  And he said, listen, you piece of trash, you're bleeping. I said, get in the car.
[1:41:33.920 --> 1:41:36.920]  And he's going, you can arrest us there.
[1:41:36.920 --> 1:41:38.920]  But this isn't any insurance.
[1:41:38.920 --> 1:41:43.920]  And I'm going to arrest you now and goes into a whole freak out search choking people.
[1:41:43.920 --> 1:41:46.920]  But the officers subdued the deadly paramedics.
[1:41:46.920 --> 1:41:52.920]  Oh, he's doing so. He was fighting our raggies and now he's fighting deadly ambulance people.
[1:41:52.920 --> 1:41:56.920]  He was scary. That ambulance is dangerous.
[1:41:56.920 --> 1:41:59.920]  That's what they go on to say. They say, this ambulance is dangerous.
[1:41:59.920 --> 1:42:02.920]  People dangerous to the public. Get ready.
[1:42:02.920 --> 1:42:05.920]  Actually, I mean, they're like Alcada or something.
[1:42:05.920 --> 1:42:09.920]  There's nothing scary in an ambulance.
[1:42:09.920 --> 1:42:11.920]  Turns out he harasses other ambulances.
[1:42:11.920 --> 1:42:16.920]  He's got like this dominant crazy power trip where he's God and that ambulance didn't yield.
[1:42:16.920 --> 1:42:17.920]  Get out of the car.
[1:42:17.920 --> 1:42:19.920]  With a woman having a baby last time.
[1:42:19.920 --> 1:42:21.920]  They're like, sir, could you have the baby?
[1:42:21.920 --> 1:42:27.920]  No, she's going to have a baby right here. Shut up. I run things. I sit and wait.
[1:42:27.920 --> 1:42:33.920]  Oh God, I got a lot of power. It's all about his power. It's a power trip.
[1:42:33.920 --> 1:42:40.920]  James claims the dashboard camera upholds his client's story showing that he acted appropriately in subduing paramedic Maurice White.
[1:42:40.920 --> 1:42:47.920]  He said that White came out of the ambulance trying to control the situation and was told repeatedly to turn to return to the back of the rig.
[1:42:47.920 --> 1:42:53.920]  See, you don't control. We're in control. It's all about a threat continuum and how they got to maintain control.
[1:42:53.920 --> 1:42:56.920]  It's like this mentally ill cult.
[1:42:56.920 --> 1:42:59.920]  Long way from Matt Dillon.
[1:42:59.920 --> 1:43:01.920]  Matt Dillon out pulling over ambulances.
[1:43:01.920 --> 1:43:06.920]  I mean, this is mental illness.
[1:43:06.920 --> 1:43:09.920]  He was asked before there was a curse word. That's defending that.
[1:43:09.920 --> 1:43:12.920]  Before there was yelling to get back in the ambulance three times.
[1:43:12.920 --> 1:43:15.920]  He did not comply with the lawful order.
[1:43:15.920 --> 1:43:19.920]  James said, no, you were breaking the law, pulling that ambulance over and driving recklessly.
[1:43:19.920 --> 1:43:21.920]  You need to be charged.
[1:43:21.920 --> 1:43:23.920]  Mr. White committed.
[1:43:23.920 --> 1:43:29.920]  Oh, there's a lot of state laws. I don't know about Oklahoma, but a lot of states have it as cops killing people that if you weren't going to an emergency call,
[1:43:29.920 --> 1:43:32.920]  you shouldn't have been driving 100 miles an hour and it's clear you're doing that.
[1:43:32.920 --> 1:43:36.920]  And then running up on the back in the neighborhood, he's going 80.
[1:43:36.920 --> 1:43:38.920]  But of that cop, a killed little kid.
[1:43:38.920 --> 1:43:42.920]  He was chasing a deadly person. Wait, I'm getting to that part.
[1:43:42.920 --> 1:43:48.920]  Mr. White committed obstruction of justice and he was told in that video, sir, you're going to be arrested for obstruction.
[1:43:48.920 --> 1:43:50.920]  And he was told that twice.
[1:43:50.920 --> 1:43:52.920]  He said, and the guy said, arrest me at the hospital.
[1:43:52.920 --> 1:43:54.920]  Let me get the lady who's having a heart attack there.
[1:43:54.920 --> 1:43:57.920]  He does not comply at that point in time.
[1:43:57.920 --> 1:43:59.920]  Yeah, doesn't comply in five seconds.
[1:43:59.920 --> 1:44:05.920]  Get in the freaking car. Get in the bleeding car. Get in the car.
[1:44:05.920 --> 1:44:07.920]  You know what I mean? Just totally mentally ill.
[1:44:07.920 --> 1:44:11.920]  Shouldn't be cleaning toilets, much less run around with a badge and gun.
[1:44:11.920 --> 1:44:17.920]  He is not comply at that point in time when the trooper tries to make an arrest.
[1:44:17.920 --> 1:44:23.920]  White claimed the trooper was out of control is simply unfounded and reading White's contradictory statement proves it.
[1:44:23.920 --> 1:44:26.920]  James said, look, the guy's completely out of control screaming.
[1:44:26.920 --> 1:44:36.920]  Then he comes around the side, gets the EMT back out and starts choking him and the other cops choking.
[1:44:36.920 --> 1:44:37.920]  That's out of control.
[1:44:37.920 --> 1:44:42.920]  We're going to show about these videos coming up.
[1:44:42.920 --> 1:44:44.920]  The officers, he got out of the vehicles in a state of rage.
[1:44:44.920 --> 1:44:47.920]  He approached my partner and said, get your ass back in there.
[1:44:47.920 --> 1:44:48.920]  Well, that's in a rage.
[1:44:48.920 --> 1:44:50.920]  I'm giving you a ticket for failure to yield.
[1:44:50.920 --> 1:44:52.920]  What do you, what do you mean flipping me off?
[1:44:52.920 --> 1:44:54.920]  Which they said they didn't do.
[1:44:54.920 --> 1:44:57.920]  I challenge you to go out there and find that it didn't happen.
[1:44:57.920 --> 1:45:05.920]  James said, since the ambulance was not running its lights or siren, James said that Martin had every right to pull over to the Creek Nation.
[1:45:05.920 --> 1:45:08.920]  He had the right to make an ambulance on May 24th.
[1:45:08.920 --> 1:45:13.920]  Oklahoma Highway Patrolman under all circumstances has the right, I guess they're God, to make a traffic stop.
[1:45:13.920 --> 1:45:20.920]  He has the right to make a traffic stop on ambulance that is not running code before it has nothing more than any other vehicle, he said.
[1:45:20.920 --> 1:45:25.920]  Martin's attorney also said, because most ambulances only turn their lights on when they need to go through traffic.
[1:45:25.920 --> 1:45:33.920]  Martin's attorney also said that if someone thought that there was a trooper acted inappropriately, there are a number of things that run through the officer's mind.
[1:45:33.920 --> 1:45:44.920]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, go talk to the state police, go talk to the, and it goes on to say, one thing that police officers are taught is that a person who will fight a police officer who will fight,
[1:45:44.920 --> 1:45:48.920]  I guess talking to him was fighting, is an extreme danger to the public.
[1:45:48.920 --> 1:45:51.920]  And they go on to say how dangerous the guy was for, for.
[1:45:51.920 --> 1:45:56.920]  Now, now we're going to, he, I mean, the MP gets out and's like, what, what is going on here?
[1:45:56.920 --> 1:45:57.920]  We got a person in the car.
[1:45:57.920 --> 1:46:03.920]  He's like, yeah, I said, boy, and the guy's like, don't talk to us like that.
[1:46:03.920 --> 1:46:06.920]  What's wrong with you?
[1:46:06.920 --> 1:46:08.920]  Somebody stand it up to me.
[1:46:08.920 --> 1:46:11.920]  I'm going crazy.
[1:46:11.920 --> 1:46:13.920]  Totally insane.
[1:46:13.920 --> 1:46:17.920]  And the state police and the governor, everybody are saying, hey, this is good.
[1:46:17.920 --> 1:46:19.920]  And that's why you're discredited and disliked.
[1:46:19.920 --> 1:46:24.920]  And you make all the other good state police officers who aren't lunatics on power trips look bad.
[1:46:24.920 --> 1:46:27.920]  And it turns out this guy's done this repeatedly.
[1:46:27.920 --> 1:46:30.920]  So I guess in Iraq, the troops do just sit off the road shooting families up in their car.
[1:46:30.920 --> 1:46:31.920]  It's on YouTube.
[1:46:31.920 --> 1:46:33.920]  We can show you just killing families for fun.
[1:46:33.920 --> 1:46:35.920]  I mean, I don't, look, we're humans.
[1:46:35.920 --> 1:46:37.920]  We don't, you're not God.
[1:46:37.920 --> 1:46:39.920]  You didn't rise after three days and we got news.
[1:46:39.920 --> 1:46:41.920]  This is America, land of the free home of the brave.
[1:46:41.920 --> 1:46:43.920]  Now land of the cowards, home of the slaves.
[1:46:43.920 --> 1:46:46.920]  Now let's go ahead and go to the dash video.
[1:46:46.920 --> 1:46:47.920]  Let's go ahead and start it.
[1:46:47.920 --> 1:46:48.920]  Here it is.
[1:46:48.920 --> 1:46:50.920]  He's driving down the road.
[1:46:50.920 --> 1:46:55.920]  Go ahead and crank the audio up behind me.
[1:46:55.920 --> 1:47:03.920]  So he's driving along at what appears to be about 85 miles an hour, 85 to 90.
[1:47:03.920 --> 1:47:07.920]  Now here he comes up on an ambulance.
[1:47:07.920 --> 1:47:14.920]  It's at about 600 yards, 300 yards, 200 yards, 100 yards.
[1:47:14.920 --> 1:47:17.920]  I mean, you know, he slows down to about 80.
[1:47:17.920 --> 1:47:19.920]  Now he's about 60.
[1:47:19.920 --> 1:47:20.920]  There's a car to stop right there.
[1:47:20.920 --> 1:47:21.920]  Back it up.
[1:47:21.920 --> 1:47:27.920]  Now the, the police car has now at at least 90 miles an hour closed on the back of this
[1:47:27.920 --> 1:47:33.920]  ambulance on a two road, windy, hilly road that he should be going about 45 on.
[1:47:33.920 --> 1:47:36.920]  He closes in seconds on the ambulance.
[1:47:36.920 --> 1:47:40.920]  The ambulance looks like it's about to get over, but then swerves out because as they
[1:47:40.920 --> 1:47:45.920]  go over the hill, there's a car in the two foot shoulder hanging out in the, in the one
[1:47:45.920 --> 1:47:49.920]  lane road, one direction, two lanes total.
[1:47:49.920 --> 1:47:52.920]  So for those listening on the radio and go to infoarge.com and watch this video, this
[1:47:52.920 --> 1:47:56.920]  is the life and death situation that we are witnessing right now.
[1:47:56.920 --> 1:47:59.920]  The ambulance is going the speed limit.
[1:47:59.920 --> 1:48:03.920]  Here comes a bad out of hell cop car on a windy two lane road.
[1:48:03.920 --> 1:48:07.920]  He's up on his butt and he's got his lights on.
[1:48:07.920 --> 1:48:11.920]  There's no way going up over the top of a hill that the ambulance can go into incoming
[1:48:11.920 --> 1:48:12.920]  traffic.
[1:48:12.920 --> 1:48:17.920]  He's stuck between incoming traffic and a car broke down in the road.
[1:48:17.920 --> 1:48:19.920]  Well, the cop doesn't like that.
[1:48:19.920 --> 1:48:22.920]  That, that ambulance should have just slammed in the back of that car.
[1:48:22.920 --> 1:48:24.920]  The rib cages should have gone through the steering column.
[1:48:24.920 --> 1:48:28.920]  They should have died and then praise the cop as they died.
[1:48:28.920 --> 1:48:30.920]  And because they didn't do that, they're going to pay.
[1:48:30.920 --> 1:48:31.920]  Back it up and show him.
[1:48:31.920 --> 1:48:32.920]  Here he comes.
[1:48:32.920 --> 1:48:33.920]  Bad out of hell.
[1:48:33.920 --> 1:48:34.920]  Back it up even more.
[1:48:34.920 --> 1:48:35.920]  Bad, but back it up even more.
[1:48:35.920 --> 1:48:41.920]  Bad out of hell up on the back of this and then look at that rotten shoulder right there.
[1:48:41.920 --> 1:48:42.920]  Now the shoulder is all rotten.
[1:48:42.920 --> 1:48:45.920]  It's only a two foot shoulder, but it's rotten like it is in rural areas.
[1:48:45.920 --> 1:48:47.920]  Just rotten shoulder.
[1:48:47.920 --> 1:48:49.920]  Here comes speed racer.
[1:48:49.920 --> 1:48:51.920]  90 miles an hour.
[1:48:51.920 --> 1:48:55.920]  90 miles an hour.
[1:48:55.920 --> 1:48:56.920]  Closing.
[1:48:56.920 --> 1:48:59.920]  80 miles an hour.
[1:48:59.920 --> 1:49:03.920]  He slows to 70.
[1:49:03.920 --> 1:49:05.920]  Two lane road.
[1:49:05.920 --> 1:49:08.920]  Ambulance has to go out in front of the God because of a car in the lane.
[1:49:08.920 --> 1:49:12.920]  The ambulance driver should have killed themselves, ramming into the car.
[1:49:12.920 --> 1:49:18.920]  He speeds around them up over the crest of a hill dangerously and accelerates.
[1:49:18.920 --> 1:49:20.920]  He's going 90 miles an hour.
[1:49:20.920 --> 1:49:22.920]  That looks about like about 95 right there.
[1:49:22.920 --> 1:49:24.920]  He slows down around a turn.
[1:49:24.920 --> 1:49:28.920]  80 miles an hour.
[1:49:28.920 --> 1:49:31.920]  He's going through now a residential area.
[1:49:31.920 --> 1:49:35.920]  Appears to be going about 100 miles an hour right now.
[1:49:35.920 --> 1:49:38.920]  And he speeds into a gas station.
[1:49:38.920 --> 1:49:41.920]  They say they got a report of a stolen car.
[1:49:41.920 --> 1:49:46.920]  He's doing about 100 right there through neighborhoods.
[1:49:46.920 --> 1:49:51.920]  And now he pulls in to the gas station.
[1:49:51.920 --> 1:49:54.920]  There's a whole bunch of police cars there.
[1:49:54.920 --> 1:49:56.920]  And now he decides to leave.
[1:49:56.920 --> 1:49:58.920]  Now he's going to go after the ambulance.
[1:49:58.920 --> 1:50:01.920]  Now he's going to speed through the neighborhood.
[1:50:01.920 --> 1:50:05.920]  Towards the hospital at speeds of 70 to 80 miles an hour in an area that
[1:50:05.920 --> 1:50:08.920]  guaranteed was no more than 20 mile an hour zone.
[1:50:08.920 --> 1:50:11.920]  Now here he goes into the 20 mile an hour zone recklessly.
[1:50:11.920 --> 1:50:13.920]  When we come back we'll play the confrontation.
[1:50:13.920 --> 1:50:16.920]  And then the up close video of them choking him.
[1:50:16.920 --> 1:50:18.920]  So that is coming up.
[1:50:18.920 --> 1:50:21.920]  Now you've already seen the reckless driving the lunacy.
[1:50:21.920 --> 1:50:27.920]  Almost driving the ambulance into a stalled car.
[1:50:27.920 --> 1:50:29.920]  Risking the God's own life.
[1:50:29.920 --> 1:50:31.920]  But I guess God's can't die.
[1:50:31.920 --> 1:50:32.920]  So he's immortal.
[1:50:32.920 --> 1:50:33.920]  Risking Hercules.
[1:50:33.920 --> 1:50:34.920]  He's half God.
[1:50:34.920 --> 1:50:36.920]  Hercules the war hero risk his own life.
[1:50:36.920 --> 1:50:39.920]  Goes out into the oncoming to go around.
[1:50:39.920 --> 1:50:42.920]  Because the Lord knows he's bored all day out there in the country.
[1:50:42.920 --> 1:50:44.920]  Finally must be the first big call he's had in a month.
[1:50:44.920 --> 1:50:46.920]  He's got some Iraqis to fight.
[1:50:46.920 --> 1:50:47.920]  I mean American people.
[1:50:47.920 --> 1:50:51.920]  So he accelerates on down the road towards the ambulance.
[1:50:51.920 --> 1:50:54.920]  And the ambulance thinks they woke up in the twilight zone.
[1:50:54.920 --> 1:50:56.920]  It is the twilight zone.
[1:50:56.920 --> 1:51:00.920]  Next stop, the twilight zone.
[1:51:00.920 --> 1:51:01.920]  You worry.
[1:51:01.920 --> 1:51:03.920]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[1:51:03.920 --> 1:51:06.920]  Hi, summer's coming and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[1:51:06.920 --> 1:51:09.920]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants,
[1:51:09.920 --> 1:51:11.920]  remember there's a learning curve.
[1:51:11.920 --> 1:51:13.920]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[1:51:13.920 --> 1:51:16.920]  To speed it up you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[1:51:16.920 --> 1:51:18.920]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[1:51:18.920 --> 1:51:21.920]  Her wild food knowledge package is the Crash Course.
[1:51:21.920 --> 1:51:25.920]  The DVD gives you a three hour overview of her world directly from her.
[1:51:25.920 --> 1:51:29.920]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[1:51:29.920 --> 1:51:33.920]  And her wild cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[1:51:33.920 --> 1:51:40.920]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist in weeks, not years.
[1:51:40.920 --> 1:51:42.920]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal.
[1:51:42.920 --> 1:51:44.920]  She's my mom and I watched her do it.
[1:51:44.920 --> 1:51:49.920]  So go to ofthefield.com or call 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[1:51:49.920 --> 1:51:50.920]  Start now.
[1:51:50.920 --> 1:51:51.920]  Knowledge is power.
[1:51:51.920 --> 1:51:52.920]  Better take action.
[1:51:52.920 --> 1:51:55.920]  I think a storm's coming.
[1:52:00.920 --> 1:52:06.920]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:52:06.920 --> 1:52:12.920]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[1:52:12.920 --> 1:52:18.920]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[1:52:18.920 --> 1:52:23.920]  Well, Obama's already fudging. He's fudged since day one in this election.
[1:52:23.920 --> 1:52:34.920]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[1:52:36.920 --> 1:52:39.920]  It's not about left to right. It's about a one-world government.
[1:52:39.920 --> 1:52:46.920]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[1:52:46.920 --> 1:52:54.920]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.

[1:53:59.920 --> 1:54:25.920]  I've got three different sources, one of them a trusted source in Washington D.C.
[1:54:25.920 --> 1:54:30.920]  that Von Bruin was being federally handled.
[1:54:30.920 --> 1:54:36.920]  That's going to be breaking here in the next few days, sooner rather than later dangerous info to have.
[1:54:36.920 --> 1:54:42.920]  In fact, I may just have to get one of the witnesses on before the show ends.
[1:54:42.920 --> 1:54:44.920]  I don't like holding on this type of info.
[1:54:44.920 --> 1:54:48.920]  We have little rules around here that keep us a little bit safe so we can finish our mission.
[1:54:48.920 --> 1:54:56.920]  I've just been so busy with other stuff I haven't been spending all the time on this. I should have the last few days working on it.
[1:54:56.920 --> 1:54:58.920]  Let's finish up.
[1:54:58.920 --> 1:55:03.920]  Go back to the video and then we'll back our next guest up to like 15 after.
[1:55:03.920 --> 1:55:05.920]  Go ahead and call him and let him know that.
[1:55:05.920 --> 1:55:09.920]  Thank you.
[1:55:09.920 --> 1:55:24.920]  The ambulance has seconds. This police car comes flying up on him so fast he has no way to get out of the way.
[1:55:24.920 --> 1:55:30.920]  I've been driving back from Shirts, Texas or driving up I-35 through Shirts, Texas.
[1:55:30.920 --> 1:55:35.920]  There's this blue charger that I see fly up on people's tails every time I'm down there.
[1:55:35.920 --> 1:55:37.920]  He must be out there giving tickets 24-7.
[1:55:37.920 --> 1:55:39.920]  Three lane I-35. I'm in the slow lane.
[1:55:39.920 --> 1:55:43.920]  Cruise control at 70 because I don't want to get tickets in that speed trap.
[1:55:43.920 --> 1:55:51.920]  And he flies up on my tail by the time I see it, literally this dark blue charger goes 100 miles an hour right up behind me.
[1:55:51.920 --> 1:55:55.920]  Almost hits me three feet and he goes, flies out and shoots on down the road.
[1:55:55.920 --> 1:55:59.920]  I mean, just absolute reckless driving. Absolutely psychopathic.
[1:55:59.920 --> 1:56:01.920]  Well, this cop's not driving that reckless.
[1:56:01.920 --> 1:56:04.920]  He's driving fast though on these windy rotten roads.
[1:56:04.920 --> 1:56:15.920]  And in seconds, he's up on that ambulance and the ambulance can't get over because there's a car in the breakdown lane.
[1:56:15.920 --> 1:56:17.920]  So as soon as it can, it gets over.
[1:56:17.920 --> 1:56:19.920]  Word fast.
[1:56:19.920 --> 1:56:22.920]  Because, I mean, they know God's about to come after them and strike them down if they don't.
[1:56:22.920 --> 1:56:24.920]  Bolts of lightning are going to hit them in the form of a taser.
[1:56:24.920 --> 1:56:27.920]  So you see them get over not fast enough.
[1:56:27.920 --> 1:56:32.920]  I mean, the only way that cop would have been happy on this power trip is if they'd have gone, all right.
[1:56:32.920 --> 1:56:38.920]  You know, say goodbye, God, I'm coming home and just steered right into that car and hope they lived.
[1:56:38.920 --> 1:56:40.920]  And the cop would still be a new piece of filth.
[1:56:40.920 --> 1:56:43.920]  Learn to get out of my way quicker. Die better.
[1:56:43.920 --> 1:56:51.920]  I mean, literally, this is the mental illness we're seeing and the cop's so delusional, he thinks, yeah, they deserved it.
[1:56:51.920 --> 1:56:54.920]  I'm going to give you a ticket, you son of a bitch.
[1:56:54.920 --> 1:56:56.920]  And that's all coming up.
[1:56:56.920 --> 1:56:59.920]  So play that video again from his squad car.
[1:56:59.920 --> 1:57:05.920]  Here it is.
[1:57:05.920 --> 1:57:07.920]  Boom, there's the car in the breakdown lane.
[1:57:07.920 --> 1:57:09.920]  They swerved to get out of God's way.
[1:57:09.920 --> 1:57:11.920]  God going up the top of the hill.
[1:57:11.920 --> 1:57:15.920]  The crest goes ahead and shoots over dangerously.
[1:57:15.920 --> 1:57:19.920]  I mean, that, I mean, I would say that ambulance dangerously pulled over for him.
[1:57:19.920 --> 1:57:22.920]  Well, it doesn't matter.
[1:57:22.920 --> 1:57:23.920]  It's like a game to cops.
[1:57:23.920 --> 1:57:24.920]  They're supposed to yield to me.
[1:57:24.920 --> 1:57:25.920]  It's the law.
[1:57:25.920 --> 1:57:32.920]  So I'm going to fly up on this family in a minivan at 100 miles an hour on I-35 and almost hit them.
[1:57:32.920 --> 1:57:35.920]  Nobody can stop me and I'll kill that whole family.
[1:57:35.920 --> 1:57:36.920]  They can be a problem.
[1:57:36.920 --> 1:57:38.920]  Yeah, just driving however they want.
[1:57:38.920 --> 1:57:41.920]  That's how America operates.
[1:57:41.920 --> 1:57:42.920]  All right, we've already shown this.
[1:57:42.920 --> 1:57:47.920]  Fast forward now to him pulling the ambulance back over after he goes to the call and there's no problem.
[1:57:47.920 --> 1:57:50.920]  Now he, let's get him on his way from leaving the gas station.
[1:57:50.920 --> 1:57:54.920]  He now drives recklessly.
[1:57:54.920 --> 1:57:57.920]  Here he is driving recklessly in the neighborhood to get to the ambulance.
[1:57:57.920 --> 1:57:58.920]  Here we go.
[1:57:58.920 --> 1:57:59.920]  Here we go.
[1:57:59.920 --> 1:58:02.920]  Speed racer with kids on their hot wheels playing.
[1:58:02.920 --> 1:58:03.920]  Crank it up.
[1:58:03.920 --> 1:58:04.920]  Let's do it.
[1:58:04.920 --> 1:58:07.920]  And now we're going.
[1:58:07.920 --> 1:58:09.920]  Now we're up to 70 in the neighborhood.
[1:58:09.920 --> 1:58:13.920]  Now we're up to 80.
[1:58:13.920 --> 1:58:15.920]  Fly it up on their tail.
[1:58:15.920 --> 1:58:17.920]  Pull over and boy, they pull over quick.
[1:58:17.920 --> 1:58:21.920]  So here's an ambulance being pulled over in a neighborhood on the way to the hospital.
[1:58:21.920 --> 1:58:23.920]  When we come back, we'll get to this.
[1:58:23.920 --> 1:58:24.920]  Okay.
[1:58:24.920 --> 1:58:25.920]  Pause right there.
[1:58:25.920 --> 1:58:26.920]  You want to see insanity.
[1:58:26.920 --> 1:58:28.920]  You want to see mental illness.
[1:58:28.920 --> 1:58:29.920]  You're going to see it.
[1:58:29.920 --> 1:58:34.920]  And they're in the news saying that the EMTs are dangerous to the public.
[1:58:34.920 --> 1:58:37.920]  This is incredible.
[1:58:37.920 --> 1:58:41.920]  We'll be right back.
[1:58:41.920 --> 1:58:44.920]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[2:00:22.920 --> 2:00:23.920]  We are live.
[2:00:23.920 --> 2:00:26.920]  Some will cast in the radio show at PrismPlanet.tv.
[2:00:26.920 --> 2:00:34.920]  The estate is going mentally ill, like they always do, thinking they're God.
[2:00:34.920 --> 2:00:40.920]  The Oklahoma Highway Patrol, I dropped this issue, but they lied and said the black guy, the EMT, assaulted them.
[2:00:40.920 --> 2:00:45.920]  Now the dash cam's released, and they're in the news calling this an assault.
[2:00:45.920 --> 2:00:52.920]  And calling this resisting for the cop car violently almost running the ambulance off the road, as you just saw.
[2:00:52.920 --> 2:00:57.920]  The ambulance instantly getting over the second after they're able to.
[2:00:57.920 --> 2:01:02.920]  Literally in two and a half seconds trying to miss a car in the breakdown lane.
[2:01:02.920 --> 2:01:12.920]  And this nut, lunatic road rage showing off to his wife running around with him, runs up and gets to boss hardworking service men that save lives.
[2:01:12.920 --> 2:01:14.920]  He enjoys it.
[2:01:14.920 --> 2:01:18.920]  Total punk, just a venomous worm.
[2:01:18.920 --> 2:01:22.920]  And everything that is anti-American, it's just disgusting.
[2:01:22.920 --> 2:01:28.920]  Absolutely disgusting that they would then demonize the EMT saying he's a criminal.
[2:01:28.920 --> 2:01:30.920]  You people have no shame.
[2:01:30.920 --> 2:01:34.920]  Now, this is him pulling the ambulance over, and the ambulance driver gets out.
[2:01:34.920 --> 2:01:40.920]  The head ambulance EMT who's in the back with a lady that thinks they have an heart attack, gets out and is like, sir, what's going on?
[2:01:40.920 --> 2:01:42.920]  Don't talk to me, I'm in charge.
[2:01:42.920 --> 2:01:46.920]  And he calls him sir, he calls him God.
[2:01:46.920 --> 2:01:53.920]  That's not enough, boy, you got to lick his boots, go ahead and play it.
[2:01:53.920 --> 2:02:01.920]  There he is in the neighborhood, jumping out, showing off.
[2:02:01.920 --> 2:02:03.920]  Now, there, now.
[2:02:03.920 --> 2:02:06.920]  Oh, you now, what's going on?
[2:02:06.920 --> 2:02:07.920]  I'm talking to the driver.
[2:02:07.920 --> 2:02:09.920]  No, no, I'm talking to you, I'm talking to you.
[2:02:09.920 --> 2:02:13.920]  Rewind that, the second he gets out, he's yelling at him.
[2:02:13.920 --> 2:02:14.920]  What is he yelling there?
[2:02:14.920 --> 2:02:16.920]  Back that up.
[2:02:16.920 --> 2:02:20.920]  The seat just jumps out and, yeah, you there, you there.
[2:02:20.920 --> 2:02:25.920]  And imagine the guy in the back with the woman they think's having a heart attack, turned out it was heat stroke.
[2:02:25.920 --> 2:02:27.920]  Going, what on earth is this?
[2:02:27.920 --> 2:02:30.920]  Turns out this guy pulls ambulances over routinely.
[2:02:30.920 --> 2:02:31.920]  Here it is.
[2:02:31.920 --> 2:02:32.920]  There, now.
[2:02:32.920 --> 2:02:35.920]  Oh, you now, what's going on?
[2:02:35.920 --> 2:02:36.920]  I'm talking to the driver.
[2:02:36.920 --> 2:02:37.920]  No, no, I'm talking to you.
[2:02:37.920 --> 2:02:39.920]  No, you better get back in that ambulance.
[2:02:39.920 --> 2:02:40.920]  I'm talking to the driver.
[2:02:40.920 --> 2:02:42.920]  I'm in charge of this unit, sir.
[2:02:42.920 --> 2:02:43.920]  Okay.
[2:02:43.920 --> 2:02:44.920]  My name is Maurice White.
[2:02:44.920 --> 2:02:45.920]  I'm a public care paramedic.
[2:02:45.920 --> 2:02:47.920]  I'm going to get you, take it from sir to you.
[2:02:47.920 --> 2:02:50.920]  And when I go by you saying what's going on, you don't need to give me no hand gestures now.
[2:02:50.920 --> 2:02:52.920]  I ain't going to understand me.
[2:02:52.920 --> 2:02:55.920]  And I won't put up with you talking to my driver like that.
[2:02:55.920 --> 2:02:56.920]  I ain't listening to you, buddy.
[2:02:56.920 --> 2:02:58.920]  You get your ass back in that ambulance.
[2:02:58.920 --> 2:02:59.920]  I'll take you in.
[2:02:59.920 --> 2:03:00.920]  I'm talking to the driver.
[2:03:00.920 --> 2:03:01.920]  Okay, and if you would.
[2:03:01.920 --> 2:03:02.920]  Come over here.
[2:03:02.920 --> 2:03:03.920]  I got a patient.
[2:03:03.920 --> 2:03:05.920]  No, we got a patient in this unit, right there.
[2:03:05.920 --> 2:03:09.920]  Okay, you want to go ahead and pull over to the side of the road when there's an emergency vehicle behind you?
[2:03:09.920 --> 2:03:10.920]  Head pause.
[2:03:10.920 --> 2:03:16.920]  This lunatic comes up on an ambulance at 90 miles an hour.
[2:03:16.920 --> 2:03:21.920]  The ambulance tries to pull over, comes over the top of the hill, sees a car broke down, barely survives it,
[2:03:21.920 --> 2:03:25.920]  and then hits over as he's so scared of the cops because they've been pulling him over in that area.
[2:03:25.920 --> 2:03:29.920]  That same crazy man with pregnant women.
[2:03:29.920 --> 2:03:33.920]  It's like I'm tasering pregnant women because the husband speeds in DC.
[2:03:33.920 --> 2:03:34.920]  They're nuts.
[2:03:34.920 --> 2:03:35.920]  They're nuts.
[2:03:35.920 --> 2:03:38.920]  They're on power trips.
[2:03:38.920 --> 2:03:46.920]  And he's screaming at him saying, you learned to pull over when they did to the God.
[2:03:46.920 --> 2:03:50.920]  I mean, just on record, you're in the wrong and you don't care.
[2:03:50.920 --> 2:03:52.920]  You're going to go attack this man.
[2:03:52.920 --> 2:03:55.920]  You've already attacked physically.
[2:03:55.920 --> 2:03:57.920]  God, we just need to start this work.
[2:03:57.920 --> 2:03:58.920]  Okay, fine.
[2:03:58.920 --> 2:03:59.920]  You want to be worshiped?
[2:03:59.920 --> 2:04:00.920]  Oh, you are God.
[2:04:00.920 --> 2:04:02.920]  Oh, you hung the moon.
[2:04:02.920 --> 2:04:04.920]  Oh, I mean, what is wrong with you people?
[2:04:04.920 --> 2:04:07.920]  Go ahead and play more of it as we go out to break.
[2:04:07.920 --> 2:04:10.920]  No, you ran up on it.
[2:04:10.920 --> 2:04:12.920]  I did not run up on it.
[2:04:12.920 --> 2:04:13.920]  But he did.
[2:04:13.920 --> 2:04:14.920]  Pause again.
[2:04:14.920 --> 2:04:15.920]  Rewind it again.
[2:04:15.920 --> 2:04:18.920]  Rewind the whole thing.
[2:04:18.920 --> 2:04:20.920]  He's saying you didn't yield to me.
[2:04:20.920 --> 2:04:23.920]  And he goes, what do you mean the way you ran up on me?
[2:04:23.920 --> 2:04:24.920]  We did yield.
[2:04:24.920 --> 2:04:26.920]  And he's like, no, you didn't.
[2:04:26.920 --> 2:04:28.920]  You don't tell an officer he's wrong.
[2:04:28.920 --> 2:04:31.920]  This lunatic, I had an Austin PD one night.
[2:04:31.920 --> 2:04:36.920]  I pulled out of the office on the access road of 290 right here.
[2:04:36.920 --> 2:04:39.920]  There's three lanes on the on the access road here.
[2:04:39.920 --> 2:04:41.920]  There's not even headlights behind me.
[2:04:41.920 --> 2:04:43.920]  A cop car had to be going 9500.
[2:04:43.920 --> 2:04:45.920]  He just zooms up all I see is lights.
[2:04:45.920 --> 2:04:47.920]  They don't have the cherries on.
[2:04:47.920 --> 2:04:49.920]  It almost hits me.
[2:04:49.920 --> 2:04:56.920]  I look over and the cop violently pulls up and shines a light in my eye and then speeds off.
[2:04:56.920 --> 2:04:57.920]  I'm lucky.
[2:04:57.920 --> 2:05:00.920]  He didn't pull me out of the car shooting in the head and go, I got power.
[2:05:00.920 --> 2:05:05.920]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[2:05:05.920 --> 2:05:09.920]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[2:05:09.920 --> 2:05:15.920]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[2:05:15.920 --> 2:05:16.920]  It's true.
[2:05:16.920 --> 2:05:20.920]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[2:05:20.920 --> 2:05:24.920]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[2:05:24.920 --> 2:05:27.920]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[2:05:27.920 --> 2:05:30.920]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[2:05:30.920 --> 2:05:34.920]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages.
[2:05:34.920 --> 2:05:39.920]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[2:05:39.920 --> 2:05:43.920]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[2:05:43.920 --> 2:05:45.920]  a long time sponsor of ours.

[2:08:21.920 --> 2:08:32.920]  But I'm not here to bash cops, it doesn't help me if I just bash cops in the military all day, but the military constitutionally and historically can't be used domestically in law enforcement.
[2:08:32.920 --> 2:08:44.920]  Northcom's announced they are, they're putting them in major police departments, small departments, they're saying they're going to take on the American people, then the DHS reports say the number one threat is veterans and conservatives and gun owners.
[2:08:44.920 --> 2:08:54.920]  Fox is saying, oh, look at Von Brune, we deserve to do DHS, it's right, the veterans are bad, they're teaching all the local departments that the vets are all going to be bombing them soon.
[2:08:54.920 --> 2:08:56.920]  Why would vets be bombing you soon?
[2:08:56.920 --> 2:09:00.920]  What is it the government's going to do so bad that vets would start bombing?
[2:09:00.920 --> 2:09:11.920]  See, you're an illegitimate government and you're getting ready for war with the people and this brainwashed vet who thinks he's God almost runs an ambulance off the road.
[2:09:11.920 --> 2:09:14.920]  The ambulance instantly gets over instantly.
[2:09:14.920 --> 2:09:18.920]  Here comes the car 90 miles an hour, that's that ambulance is over.
[2:09:18.920 --> 2:09:35.920]  And then he drives recklessly through a neighborhood, chases the ambulance down, gets out and starts yelling at him, telling him you didn't get over quick and the head EMT goes, you ran up on us, we got over.
[2:09:35.920 --> 2:09:43.920]  Play it from the time he jumps out again and we're going to mute, we haven't edited this, we're going to mute the cuss words, so they're in there trying their best to mute it.
[2:09:43.920 --> 2:09:54.920]  Here we go, here's the video.
[2:09:54.920 --> 2:09:56.920]  Now, there, now.
[2:09:56.920 --> 2:09:58.920]  What's going on?
[2:09:58.920 --> 2:10:00.920]  I'm talking to the driver.
[2:10:00.920 --> 2:10:01.920]  No, no, I'm talking to you.
[2:10:01.920 --> 2:10:03.920]  No, you better get back in that ambulance.
[2:10:03.920 --> 2:10:04.920]  I'm talking to the driver.
[2:10:04.920 --> 2:10:05.920]  I'm in charge of this unit, sir.
[2:10:05.920 --> 2:10:06.920]  Okay.
[2:10:06.920 --> 2:10:07.920]  My name is Maurice White.
[2:10:07.920 --> 2:10:08.920]  I'm a public care paramedic.
[2:10:08.920 --> 2:10:14.920]  I'm going to get you to take it from sir to you, and when I go by you saying what's going on, you'll need to give me those hand gestures now.
[2:10:14.920 --> 2:10:16.920]  I ain't going to put up, you understand me?
[2:10:16.920 --> 2:10:18.920]  And I won't put up with you talking to my driver like that.
[2:10:18.920 --> 2:10:20.920]  I ain't listening to you, buddy.
[2:10:20.920 --> 2:10:22.920]  You get your ass back in that ambulance or I'll take you in.
[2:10:22.920 --> 2:10:23.920]  I'm talking to the driver.
[2:10:23.920 --> 2:10:24.920]  I'll stand if you would.
[2:10:24.920 --> 2:10:25.920]  Come over here, Paul.
[2:10:25.920 --> 2:10:26.920]  No, we got a patient.
[2:10:26.920 --> 2:10:28.920]  No, we got a patient in this unit, right there.
[2:10:28.920 --> 2:10:32.920]  Okay, you want to go ahead and pull over to the side of the road when there's an emergency vehicle behind you?
[2:10:32.920 --> 2:10:36.920]  I didn't know that you ran up on us.
[2:10:36.920 --> 2:10:39.920]  I did not run up on you, clicker, buddy.
[2:10:39.920 --> 2:10:40.920]  Yes, you did.
[2:10:40.920 --> 2:10:43.920]  You ran into that ambulance before you get your bus to jail now.
[2:10:43.920 --> 2:10:44.920]  You understand me?
[2:10:44.920 --> 2:10:46.920]  We're going to get my face to the hospital.
[2:10:46.920 --> 2:10:47.920]  You can take me to jail.
[2:10:47.920 --> 2:10:48.920]  We'll discuss this.
[2:10:48.920 --> 2:10:49.920]  Okay?
[2:10:49.920 --> 2:10:50.920]  Come here, Paul.
[2:10:50.920 --> 2:10:51.920]  No, no.
[2:10:51.920 --> 2:10:52.920]  I've got a patient in this unit.
[2:10:52.920 --> 2:10:53.920]  Get your ass up.
[2:10:53.920 --> 2:10:54.920]  Hey!
[2:10:54.920 --> 2:10:55.920]  Hey!
[2:10:55.920 --> 2:10:56.920]  Hold on.

[2:11:30.920 --> 2:11:31.920]  Hey!
[2:11:31.920 --> 2:11:32.920]  Hey!
[2:11:32.920 --> 2:11:33.920]  Hey!
[2:11:33.920 --> 2:11:38.640]  You're trying to run an ambulance off the road, driving around like a maniac in neighborhoods,
[2:11:38.640 --> 2:11:45.120]  and then you assault people and choke them and all this stuff, and then they're the ones that are bad?
[2:11:47.120 --> 2:11:52.480]  I mean, you people are out of your minds, but you work for criminal bankers. They put you in power
[2:11:52.480 --> 2:11:56.880]  to carry out criminal activity against the people, and you're doing a great job. You're out of your
[2:11:56.880 --> 2:12:00.560]  mind. The sick part is these cops don't even think they're evil. They really believe they're
[2:12:00.560 --> 2:12:06.320]  unbaloney, but the good cops out there, they're ashamed of you, and it's too bad you're tarnishing
[2:12:06.320 --> 2:12:22.880]  their name and the sacrifices they make. You are ashamed to everybody. Let's go ahead and play it.
[2:12:36.720 --> 2:13:05.840]  I had
[2:13:05.840 --> 2:13:12.080]  pause. Now here's the EMT as they're choking him. None other cops run around now, and we have the
[2:13:12.080 --> 2:13:17.440]  video up close of that from the handheld camera, the cell phone camera. He's calmly being choked,
[2:13:17.440 --> 2:13:20.960]  and they're saying, turn down, you know, submit, don't fight back while they're choking him,
[2:13:20.960 --> 2:13:24.640]  and he's sitting there calmly with his hands going, you're the one choking me, calm down.
[2:13:24.640 --> 2:13:30.080]  He's the real man. He's the guy on the right who put up with your crap. I don't know if I can handle
[2:13:30.080 --> 2:13:34.800]  somebody shoving me around and attacking me, acting all nuts in my face, and the cop starts
[2:13:34.800 --> 2:13:39.280]  assaulting him, and the big black guy is just controlling him with ease, going, now stop that
[2:13:39.280 --> 2:13:42.640]  till the next cop shows up, and he figures out these cops are about to kill me. I better
[2:13:43.280 --> 2:13:46.880]  let him go ahead and hurt me. He goes, okay, go ahead and hurt me, and they get off on the
[2:13:46.880 --> 2:13:52.400]  cult of torturing him, and you see him getting off on it. I mean, you guys are out of your minds.
[2:13:52.400 --> 2:13:57.440]  And then finally, another higher-level state-of-the-police shows up and tells them, stop it,
[2:13:57.440 --> 2:14:02.080]  because it's obviously very embarrassing and the same. Finally, a state trooper with half
[2:14:02.080 --> 2:14:07.200]  brain shows up here in the back row on, okay, that's enough, let him go. But the two lunatics
[2:14:07.200 --> 2:14:16.240]  that first show up, they're just out of their minds. Out of your minds. Out of your minds.
[2:14:18.400 --> 2:14:22.960]  Don't you even care about yourselves driving around at 90 miles an hour on windy, hilly roads
[2:14:22.960 --> 2:14:29.680]  with rotten shoulders in Oklahoma, as bad as the roads in East Texas, and the ambulance pulls over
[2:14:29.680 --> 2:14:34.720]  instantly for you, and that's not good enough? You flip out as you're showing off to your wife.
[2:14:34.720 --> 2:14:41.280]  You're got PTSD guaranteed. You're out of your mind. Admit you did wrong and start being a man.
[2:14:41.280 --> 2:14:46.400]  Instead of acting like a big baby, because you're going to lose all the respect you got with the
[2:14:46.400 --> 2:14:50.880]  people, and it's not going to go well for the police. I'm just telling you right now, the people
[2:14:50.880 --> 2:14:56.320]  are getting sick of your red coat activities. All right, I apologize about getting our guest on 10
[2:14:56.320 --> 2:15:03.200]  minutes late, but I wanted to finish that video. Perhaps the end of the show will play a clip
[2:15:03.200 --> 2:15:07.840]  of them choking them up close. But Thomas Woods, author of Meltdown is on with us for the rest of
[2:15:07.840 --> 2:15:17.520]  the hour. And we appreciate him coming on the show. He is a senior fellow with the Lubig Von
[2:15:17.520 --> 2:15:21.920]  Mies Institute with Ron Paul. He holds a bachelor's degree in history from Harvard, and his master's
[2:15:21.920 --> 2:15:27.280]  PhD from Columbia University. He's an author of nine books, including two New York Times best
[2:15:27.280 --> 2:15:31.520]  sellers, Meltdown, a free market look. While the stock market collapsed, the economy tank and
[2:15:31.520 --> 2:15:36.080]  government bailouts will make things worse, and the politically incorrect guy to American history.
[2:15:37.040 --> 2:15:42.960]  So he joins us right now, Thomas E. Woods, to give us his perspective on what's happening with the
[2:15:42.960 --> 2:15:47.120]  economy and where the government's taking us. Thanks for coming on, Mr. Woods. My pleasure.
[2:15:47.120 --> 2:15:54.560]  You bet. Okay, tell us from the Von Mies Austrian school angle what's really happened here and where
[2:15:54.560 --> 2:15:58.960]  we're going. I think the only point of disagreement we may have is that I know this is engineered
[2:15:58.960 --> 2:16:03.760]  from the IMF World Bank documents. They implode things by design to then bring in even more
[2:16:03.760 --> 2:16:08.000]  control in the next phase of their Ponzi scheme. I don't know your view on that, but I do agree
[2:16:08.000 --> 2:16:12.480]  with you regardless that government's, quote, making it worse for the common person. Go ahead.
[2:16:12.480 --> 2:16:18.160]  Well, there's certainly the case that regardless of where these busts come from, and I mean,
[2:16:18.160 --> 2:16:23.360]  I argue that it's what the Fed is doing to us. The Federal Reserve gives rise to these busts.
[2:16:23.360 --> 2:16:29.360]  The bottom line is that they always use the bust that they brought about as a pretext to get more
[2:16:29.360 --> 2:16:34.880]  power over it. It's a perverse dynamic. And unfortunately, we have so many people who are
[2:16:35.440 --> 2:16:40.960]  right now because of Obama and his alleged charisma. We have people who are so zombified
[2:16:40.960 --> 2:16:45.200]  that they're just going to sit back and go along with what's being said. And I think it could not
[2:16:45.200 --> 2:16:52.000]  be more important for people who believe in freedom and who actually believe in a real,
[2:16:52.000 --> 2:16:57.600]  free economy, not a manipulated one, to be able to answer these people, to show that every single
[2:16:57.600 --> 2:17:02.560]  thing they're recommending would make things worse. All the fiscal stimulus nonsense, the
[2:17:02.560 --> 2:17:06.480]  monetary stimulus nonsense, printing up money, every one of these suggestions,
[2:17:06.480 --> 2:17:12.080]  you could make a superficially plausible argument for, but if you get one millimeter beneath the
[2:17:12.080 --> 2:17:19.120]  surface, every bit of it makes us poorer and gives them pretexts for still more power because
[2:17:19.120 --> 2:17:25.200]  they perpetuate the depression. Let's start with GM. Let's kind of start at the end and then
[2:17:25.200 --> 2:17:31.200]  after the break, go back to the beginning of these monetary systems, $30 billion to give it
[2:17:31.200 --> 2:17:37.040]  to select globalist crony capitalism or monopoly capitalism, non-free market groups,
[2:17:37.040 --> 2:17:42.800]  to then give it to the Brazilians, give pieces to the Chinese and to the Russians and to the
[2:17:42.800 --> 2:17:48.640]  Europeans, having it off where the president fires the CEO because he won't do it, hijacks it,
[2:17:48.640 --> 2:17:53.680]  and now it's confirmed in Congress, as I'm sure you know, that if you give Democratic donations
[2:17:53.680 --> 2:18:00.080]  to Democratic Congresspeople, they'll allow your GM dealership to stay open. If not, they grab it
[2:18:00.080 --> 2:18:06.560]  and give it to somebody else. So it's Chicago big city machine robbing everybody, then that's,
[2:18:06.560 --> 2:18:12.720]  as you said, only one millimeter in to quote, saving GM. Absolutely. And meanwhile, we're being
[2:18:12.720 --> 2:18:17.680]  told that this is the last thing Obama wants to do. He doesn't want to run GM. So, you know,
[2:18:17.680 --> 2:18:22.640]  the usual, I think my usual rule of thumb is whatever they say, the opposite is true. So
[2:18:22.640 --> 2:18:27.040]  when he says he just absolutely hates the idea of running GM, you know, sorry, I guess I just
[2:18:27.040 --> 2:18:31.200]  don't buy that. But we're being told that eventually don't worry, you know, the government is going
[2:18:31.200 --> 2:18:36.240]  to sell off its share of GM and return it to private hands and don't worry about it. But
[2:18:36.240 --> 2:18:41.120]  after however long they're going to have it, I don't know, a year, two years, who knows how long,
[2:18:41.120 --> 2:18:45.680]  and they mismanagement, mismanage it inevitably. They use it as a big pork barrel thing.
[2:18:46.400 --> 2:18:49.840]  Who would want to buy it? I mean, they're going to run the thing even further into the ground.
[2:18:49.840 --> 2:18:55.200]  Who are they going to sell it to? So they're going to wind up having it forever, as far as I can see.
[2:18:55.200 --> 2:18:59.760]  Well, I mean, having the skeleton, it's kind of like they've eaten all the meat off the turkey
[2:18:59.760 --> 2:19:06.800]  and there's bones laying there. They're giving it to little select cronies, you know, big pieces of
[2:19:06.800 --> 2:19:14.000]  it, and then making us finance kind of like a new IMF World Bank boondoggle, but through the vehicle
[2:19:14.000 --> 2:19:19.920]  of GM. And it's worth noting that, you know, GM is obviously not the only bankruptcy we've had
[2:19:19.920 --> 2:19:25.040]  going on. We've had major, major bankruptcies of major chains, everything from linens and things
[2:19:25.040 --> 2:19:30.000]  to circuit city. And the rule is that if you can't get financing to keep your operation
[2:19:30.000 --> 2:19:34.240]  running during the bankruptcy proceeding, then you've got to liquidate and that's the end of it.
[2:19:34.240 --> 2:19:38.240]  So circuit city and linens and things, a lot of these companies couldn't get that financing,
[2:19:38.240 --> 2:19:42.720]  so they liquidated. Stay there, we've got a break. And then now on top of it, they're saying
[2:19:42.720 --> 2:19:47.440]  they're going to bail out the media. That means merging with the government. ABC News is announcing
[2:19:47.440 --> 2:19:52.240]  they're getting fully behind socialized healthcare and will now become an organ officially
[2:19:52.240 --> 2:19:56.640]  of the White House. That's a headline at info wars.com. We've got the author Thomas Woods
[2:19:56.640 --> 2:19:59.120]  on Thomas Woods.com. Stay with us. We'll be right back.

[2:21:01.680 --> 2:21:07.120]  In the new world order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[2:21:07.760 --> 2:21:12.640]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would
[2:21:12.640 --> 2:21:18.240]  like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the
[2:21:18.240 --> 2:21:23.760]  best interest of the American people. While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in
[2:21:23.760 --> 2:21:28.800]  this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[2:21:28.800 --> 2:21:35.600]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[2:21:35.600 --> 2:21:43.360]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one world government. This film documents who Obama
[2:21:43.360 --> 2:21:50.880]  works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception today

[2:24:04.000 --> 2:24:10.480]  Tom Woods.com is the website. He is New York Times best-selling author of multiple books.
[2:24:11.200 --> 2:24:15.280]  Meltdown, a free market look at why the stock market collapsed, the economy tanked,
[2:24:15.280 --> 2:24:18.240]  and government bailouts will make things worse. Okay, I'm going to try to sit back
[2:24:18.240 --> 2:24:22.720]  on one of the fellows at the Von Mies Institute with Ron Paul. I want to sit back and let you
[2:24:22.720 --> 2:24:26.080]  break it down from your perspective, but I just want to throw out, what do you think of this
[2:24:26.080 --> 2:24:31.200]  hoax of Newsweek and others saying that we're all socialists now and that this is socialism?
[2:24:31.200 --> 2:24:35.840]  Socialism, I think, is bad enough, but supposedly some of the stolen money goes to the poor.
[2:24:36.400 --> 2:24:42.400]  This is offshore corporations looting us and sanguating us and sucking us dry.
[2:24:42.400 --> 2:24:51.040]  I mean, this is not socialism. We're seeing, isn't this just highway robbery or piracy that's going
[2:24:51.040 --> 2:24:55.280]  on, sir? Yeah, I mean, it seems to me that I wouldn't even want to dignify it with a word.
[2:24:56.560 --> 2:25:02.320]  Other than looting, there's no economic philosophy behind it. It's just whatever economic
[2:25:02.320 --> 2:25:06.880]  rationale they try to put forth for it, it's just a cover for looting the population in
[2:25:06.880 --> 2:25:12.080]  broad daylight, and they must really get a good laugh out of how easy it is, how they're getting
[2:25:12.080 --> 2:25:16.240]  away with it, and how they've got the media in their pockets that just echoes all the
[2:25:16.240 --> 2:25:20.960]  rationales that, like, for instance, we hear things like systemic risk, that, oh, you know,
[2:25:20.960 --> 2:25:25.120]  we've got to bail out these bankers because, you know, heaven knows if one of these institutions
[2:25:25.120 --> 2:25:29.520]  failed, then the others would fail, and then we'd all be reduced to crawling around eating worms,
[2:25:29.520 --> 2:25:33.760]  but in fact, gosh, there was an article two or three years ago in something called The Journal
[2:25:33.760 --> 2:25:38.160]  of Financial Economics that went through all these arguments and concluded that this whole
[2:25:38.160 --> 2:25:43.840]  systemic risk thing is totally overblown, that the actual systemic risk is about zero. This is
[2:25:43.840 --> 2:25:50.160]  basically just a convenient pretext for politicians when they're shoveling money to their friends.
[2:25:50.160 --> 2:25:53.840]  They can cover it by saying, oh, no, no, no, I'm just acting for the common good. I'm acting for
[2:25:53.840 --> 2:26:00.240]  you people to maintain the system. Now, come on. Meanwhile, the tenure notes going up,
[2:26:01.920 --> 2:26:06.640]  mortgage rates are going up in reality. They can cut rates down to zero, reality setting in.
[2:26:06.640 --> 2:26:10.480]  And they're saying, other economists, I don't know what your views are saying,
[2:26:10.480 --> 2:26:15.120]  we're at 18, 19% real employment. I mean, how long can this charade go on?
[2:26:16.080 --> 2:26:19.120]  Well, I'm surprised it's gone on as long as it has, but you're right. I mean,
[2:26:19.120 --> 2:26:24.080]  I think your unemployment statistics are far more accurate than the phony baloney ones cooked
[2:26:24.080 --> 2:26:28.560]  up by the government that they've been manipulating for years. If you really compare our situation
[2:26:28.560 --> 2:26:34.560]  with the 1970s and you compute the unemployment statistics the way they did, we're already at
[2:26:34.560 --> 2:26:40.080]  or above 20% because one of the things they did, I'm sure you already know this, is the 80s and
[2:26:40.080 --> 2:26:44.240]  90s, they got rid of the discouraged worker, which means that you've been looking for a job
[2:26:44.240 --> 2:26:48.080]  and you're looking and looking and you just figure this is totally hopeless and you just stop,
[2:26:48.080 --> 2:26:51.600]  you figure it's not even worth bothering. They don't count you as being unemployed.
[2:26:51.600 --> 2:26:56.000]  So the millions of people that moved in with mommy and daddy or parents that moved in with
[2:26:56.000 --> 2:27:00.800]  their kids or homeless people, they just don't count us. No, they don't count them. So that,
[2:27:00.800 --> 2:27:07.280]  so in other words, when you're hearing that the official statistic has it at 9.4% unemployment,
[2:27:07.280 --> 2:27:11.680]  you can believe the reality is at least double that. And then we don't, it doesn't factor in
[2:27:11.680 --> 2:27:17.440]  all the part-time workers. And it is essential for us to get where this comes from. Look,
[2:27:17.440 --> 2:27:21.760]  why does this happen to us? Because of course, we're being told that, well, it just goes to
[2:27:21.760 --> 2:27:26.240]  show that when your overlords aren't running everything, this is what happens and you stupid
[2:27:26.240 --> 2:27:31.120]  rubs didn't listen to us. That whole thing is becoming the conventional wisdom. Exactly.
[2:27:31.120 --> 2:27:36.080]  They're saying you need bigger overlords. That will fix it when it's the very overlords that
[2:27:36.080 --> 2:27:41.920]  did it. And so it's so funny when the German Chancellor Merkel said, you know, it's like
[2:27:41.920 --> 2:27:45.680]  when they occasionally say something sensible, they have to immediately follow it up with
[2:27:45.680 --> 2:27:50.720]  something disastrous. So she said, you know, gee, the central banks have really done a rotten job.
[2:27:50.720 --> 2:27:54.880]  Hey, great so far. And then she goes on to say, therefore, we need to have a giant
[2:27:54.880 --> 2:28:00.000]  coordination of all the central banks. No, that's the exact opposite direction we want to go in.
[2:28:00.000 --> 2:28:04.080]  We should be wanting to shut these things down. They have, they, it is they,
[2:28:04.080 --> 2:28:08.080]  and this is what Austrian theory teaches. It's what Hayek won the Nobel Prize for.
[2:28:08.080 --> 2:28:14.400]  It is they who get the economy hopped up on these unsustainable booms that then ruin people's lives
[2:28:14.400 --> 2:28:18.640]  when the bust comes. But during the boom, we're all told that, hey, this prosperity is going to
[2:28:18.640 --> 2:28:23.120]  go on forever. Everybody should get into the stock market. And everybody starts thinking that,
[2:28:23.120 --> 2:28:27.600]  you know, you can get rich quick through all this. And meanwhile, you wind up getting wiped
[2:28:27.600 --> 2:28:32.160]  out. And it's about time Americans realize this is not the free market looting you.
[2:28:32.160 --> 2:28:37.600]  It is Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke and his friends. And you know, when Alan Greenspan said
[2:28:37.600 --> 2:28:42.000]  earlier this year, he said, you know, I guess there's a flaw in the free market that I hadn't
[2:28:42.000 --> 2:28:45.840]  noticed before. Yeah, you know what, Alan, we have met the flaw and it is you.
[2:28:46.720 --> 2:28:50.480]  Well, exactly. And he knows what he's doing. It's problem reaction solution. They create
[2:28:50.480 --> 2:28:55.600]  the crisis. Now everybody's freaking out the public's ignorant about economics. So they're
[2:28:55.600 --> 2:29:01.440]  believing the guys in suits and Bernanke says he'll fix it with accelerating the old model,
[2:29:01.440 --> 2:29:07.840]  a new bank of the world that will pay our carbon taxes to and they're going to jack up world taxes
[2:29:07.840 --> 2:29:14.880]  and not let there be these these cash sinks, these these tax avoidance countries and and
[2:29:14.880 --> 2:29:20.800]  the bankers they will have. I mean, they're openly announcing a bank of the world world government

[2:33:21.680 --> 2:33:27.360]  They had hidden cameras as the police tried to plant drugs on them. You see, we're using
[2:33:27.360 --> 2:33:31.760]  Big Brother's tools against Big Brother and we're going to document everything we're talking about
[2:33:31.760 --> 2:33:36.160]  as this rotten criminal government is exposed. Going back to our guest here in one moment,
[2:33:36.160 --> 2:33:41.040]  I want to tell you about one of our new sponsors first here, ladies and gentlemen and that's Front
[2:33:41.040 --> 2:33:55.440]  Site. The website is frontsite.com. Listen, it's very simple. This is the number one private
[2:33:55.440 --> 2:34:02.000]  firearms training system in the country and they have systems you can get from a distance or you
[2:34:02.000 --> 2:34:07.120]  can go there and take the training and everybody I knew 10 years ago was taking this. Police,
[2:34:07.120 --> 2:34:12.800]  I know. I used to do shooting competition. I didn't get into it deep, but I did some of it.
[2:34:12.800 --> 2:34:16.800]  The point is they were all in the front site and this is better than the law enforcement
[2:34:16.800 --> 2:34:24.000]  military training. In fact, they send the police and people there to get Dr. Ignatius Piazza's
[2:34:24.000 --> 2:34:29.440]  training, the founder of Front Site Firearms Training Institute. He's offering a free handgun
[2:34:29.440 --> 2:34:37.760]  and five days of firearms training to my listeners. He's offering five days of firearms training
[2:34:37.760 --> 2:34:40.880]  to my listeners and it comes along with a 30-stake and seal weapons permit.
[2:34:41.840 --> 2:34:47.120]  So just find out about the deal and how you get a free Springfield Armory XD pistol
[2:34:47.120 --> 2:34:54.240]  and the caliber of your choice. That's frontsite.com, F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T.com.
[2:34:54.240 --> 2:35:00.080]  And when he contacted me and I found out he was a listener, because I mean really this is the
[2:35:00.080 --> 2:35:05.200]  premier private firearms training and it's in a non-boot camp type atmosphere. I was really
[2:35:05.200 --> 2:35:12.000]  flattered. And then he's the first of the time offer, this free offer for a free handgun and
[2:35:12.000 --> 2:35:18.800]  basically the course at half price. Just check them out at frontsite.com. Okay. Also to support
[2:35:18.800 --> 2:35:23.360]  us on the radio show what we're doing, don't forget infowars.com, the online video and bookstore
[2:35:23.360 --> 2:35:27.680]  shopping cart, lots of new books and videos we're adding there. And of course my film,
[2:35:27.680 --> 2:35:31.920]  The Obama Deception, Lots of Discounts on Patriot T-shirts that help spread the word
[2:35:31.920 --> 2:35:37.920]  and meet like-minded people. Like the answer to 1984, 1776. I keep getting emails from new listeners
[2:35:37.920 --> 2:35:43.600]  going, you're always talking about 1984 and you're always talking about 1776. What is that? So I've
[2:35:43.600 --> 2:35:49.280]  emailed a few back though I don't have time and I say, are you joking? And they email back and say,
[2:35:49.280 --> 2:35:54.960]  no. And I go, 1776 is the Declaration of Independence against tyranny, the true flower of the
[2:35:54.960 --> 2:36:03.920]  Renaissance. Okay. And 1984 is the opposite of that tyranny. So we're in a 1984 society, the answer
[2:36:03.920 --> 2:36:10.720]  is 1776. Anyways, that's why this show is here. So people learn basic stuff like that. I'm not on
[2:36:10.720 --> 2:36:14.080]  some high horse either. I'm an average guy. Now let's go to somebody who isn't an average guy,
[2:36:14.080 --> 2:36:20.800]  Thomas E. Woods and you know, economist, researcher, historian, and we appreciate
[2:36:20.800 --> 2:36:24.960]  him coming on the show. He's with the Lubig von Mies Institute. Okay. Continuing, sir,
[2:36:24.960 --> 2:36:29.360]  I'd gotten up to the point of the new Bank of the World Financial Times of London and now for
[2:36:29.360 --> 2:36:35.840]  world government ruled by the very George Soros pirates. Please continue and go through the facts
[2:36:35.840 --> 2:36:39.680]  proving for people that don't know that government is making it worse.
[2:36:39.680 --> 2:36:46.000]  Well, there's no question about it. I mean, the short version is that now to some extent,
[2:36:46.000 --> 2:36:50.320]  we can say the Fed is a private institution. That's all well and good. But as a private
[2:36:50.320 --> 2:36:55.680]  institution, it would be in big trouble if it didn't have the monopoly power the government gave it
[2:36:55.680 --> 2:37:00.480]  to create all the money it wants to out of thin air. That's the government and central banks
[2:37:00.480 --> 2:37:06.400]  always have incestuous relationships with each other. And this one works both ways. And it's
[2:37:06.400 --> 2:37:12.560]  the Fed that basically gave us this boom by forcing interest rates really low, getting
[2:37:12.560 --> 2:37:17.040]  the economy on a boom that it couldn't sustain in the long run, and bidding up housing prices.
[2:37:17.040 --> 2:37:20.960]  We wouldn't have had this housing bubble, the bursting of which has ruined so many people's
[2:37:20.960 --> 2:37:26.320]  lives if we hadn't insisted on having a Soviet commissar running our money and interest rates,
[2:37:26.320 --> 2:37:29.760]  because what would have happened is if you and I had just started buying a lot of houses,
[2:37:29.760 --> 2:37:34.000]  just as a hobby or something, on a free market, the banks would have run out of money to lend
[2:37:34.000 --> 2:37:37.520]  to us and interest rates would have shot up. And that would have put an end to all this speculation.
[2:37:37.520 --> 2:37:41.600]  We wouldn't have had people buying five investment properties and having no job.
[2:37:41.600 --> 2:37:47.440]  But when you have the Ellen Greenspan figure, the great maestro, and he can create all the money
[2:37:47.440 --> 2:37:52.000]  he wants, well, he can give the banks even more to lend and keep this artificial boom going.
[2:37:52.000 --> 2:37:56.320]  And they didn't stop there. They then packaged the crud. Well, explain that later, but go ahead.
[2:37:56.320 --> 2:38:00.960]  Yeah, then they packaged the crud, sell it all over the world. And meanwhile, all their experts,
[2:38:00.960 --> 2:38:05.040]  the Fed economists, even Ben Bernanke himself, was saying, no, there's no housing bubble.
[2:38:05.040 --> 2:38:09.280]  These prices are sustainable. They're real. Go ahead. You should have an adjustable rate
[2:38:09.280 --> 2:38:13.120]  mortgage. You should do all these things. Wonderful. I mean, and so people did,
[2:38:13.120 --> 2:38:17.120]  understandably. And they flipped houses and people thought they could make a living
[2:38:17.120 --> 2:38:20.800]  simply by living in a house. And there's something wrong with that that you could think
[2:38:20.800 --> 2:38:25.280]  that by sitting here in my house, I'm going to get wealthy. But it feeds into this sort of get
[2:38:25.280 --> 2:38:30.240]  rich quick sort of mentality. It's delusion. Is it not mass delusion? It absolutely was.
[2:38:30.240 --> 2:38:34.480]  And so it just fed on itself. And eventually, inevitably, this has to crash. There are only
[2:38:34.480 --> 2:38:40.480]  so many $900,000 houses people are prepared to buy. So this is an entirely a federal reserve
[2:38:40.480 --> 2:38:46.800]  system engineered boom and bust. And then we just read just today that now the Fed
[2:38:46.800 --> 2:38:51.200]  is going to be given even more powers over American businesses in the future. So again,
[2:38:51.200 --> 2:38:56.880]  as usual, the lesson is, no matter how much you screw up, the solution is we're going to give you
[2:38:56.880 --> 2:39:01.200]  more power. No matter what happens, that is always a thing. And there's a question that you
[2:39:01.200 --> 2:39:06.720]  can continue with your expert breakdown. Sure. The issue is even Senator Byrd, the fossil,
[2:39:06.720 --> 2:39:12.240]  is saying the czars are unconstitutional. It's unconstitutional to announce that the TSA is
[2:39:12.240 --> 2:39:16.880]  going to be in every major city running checkpoints on the road and on bus terminals and trains.
[2:39:17.440 --> 2:39:24.080]  And and that and to have the president grab GM and fire the CEO. I mean, we've, I mean,
[2:39:24.080 --> 2:39:28.720]  I can't even believe it's getting this crazy. What's coming next? I mean, it's all completely
[2:39:28.720 --> 2:39:33.680]  illegal. Well, I think, I think they're being encouraged by the fact that they take these risks.
[2:39:33.680 --> 2:39:37.120]  They say, you know what, we're going to, we're going to see what the American population does
[2:39:37.120 --> 2:39:42.800]  if we take over the car companies or if we fire the the CEO or if we put checkpoints everywhere.
[2:39:42.800 --> 2:39:47.520]  And, you know, by and large, I do think the number of people who are resisting this is growing,
[2:39:47.520 --> 2:39:51.680]  but it's not growing fast enough. And it can't grow fast enough. And so I think they're being
[2:39:51.680 --> 2:39:56.800]  encouraged to do more to go faster than I think they imagined they could get away with at this point.
[2:39:56.800 --> 2:40:00.640]  Well, that's it. I mean, they're announcing Northcom and the Army Times is ready to quote
[2:40:00.640 --> 2:40:06.080]  shoot Americans and that the Army's new job is worrying about veterans and gun owners and DHS
[2:40:06.080 --> 2:40:11.040]  reports and everything's getting crazed. And the news admits that Texas police everywhere just
[2:40:11.040 --> 2:40:16.000]  robbing old ladies of their wallets. I mean, it's really becoming twilight zone. I mean,
[2:40:16.000 --> 2:40:22.800]  I mean, how much crazier do you think it'll get? Well, I mean, I'm surprised it got this crazy.
[2:40:22.800 --> 2:40:28.160]  So I think it's very hard to put an upper bound on it. But what's what most irritates me is the
[2:40:28.160 --> 2:40:34.080]  idea that people who question something like the Fed, which you would think a normal society would
[2:40:34.080 --> 2:40:39.520]  question if one guy can create trillions of dollars and then blow it and not even have to
[2:40:39.520 --> 2:40:42.960]  tell us where it's going. You would think a normal society would question that. But you're
[2:40:42.960 --> 2:40:47.760]  considered to be off the wall crazy if you want to know what's going on with all this money.
[2:40:47.760 --> 2:40:53.440]  But you would think that would be the normal reaction. And I get told a lot on the radio that
[2:40:54.160 --> 2:40:58.800]  since I favor abolishing the Fed that I'm just throwing out the baby with the bathwater.
[2:40:58.800 --> 2:41:03.440]  Well, guilty is charged because it's a demon baby. You know, I want the bathwater, the old
[2:41:03.440 --> 2:41:08.880]  tub out of here. This institution. Exactly. It's the demon baby that created all this. Sorry,
[2:41:08.880 --> 2:41:17.200]  go ahead. It created all this. It makes the wars possible. It is the central funder of the empire.
[2:41:17.200 --> 2:41:22.800]  It is the lifeblood of the empire. And it is at the same time, as I say, it is the author of the
[2:41:22.800 --> 2:41:29.040]  Booms and Bus. And it is also the institution that in effect encourages all this crazy risky
[2:41:29.040 --> 2:41:34.160]  behavior because the major Wall Street firms, they know, and they have known for a long time,
[2:41:34.160 --> 2:41:38.880]  and especially during Greenspan's tenure, that if things really get bad for the major Wall
[2:41:38.880 --> 2:41:42.880]  Street actors, Alan Greenspan, or whoever the Fed chairman happens to be at the time,
[2:41:42.880 --> 2:41:46.800]  will bail you out because he has the power to do it. He can do it. He can create the money to
[2:41:46.800 --> 2:41:52.240]  bail you out. So why should we be surprised? We have no right to be surprised if Wall Street
[2:41:52.240 --> 2:41:57.040]  begins to get drunk, as George W. Bush said. Well, why shouldn't they? You know, I mean,
[2:41:57.040 --> 2:42:02.320]  they've got a safe ride home, sitting right in the room. You know, why shouldn't they get drunk?
[2:42:02.320 --> 2:42:07.440]  Yeah, they're validated. They're encouraged to loot and steal. Meanwhile, you make a thousand
[2:42:07.440 --> 2:42:11.200]  dollar mistake on your income tax that the money's paid to the private fellow reserve.
[2:42:11.200 --> 2:42:16.000]  And three years later, it's 15,000 in penalties and interest. And there's no judge or jury,
[2:42:16.000 --> 2:42:22.080]  no court for you. We're held to this super high standard. And I'm seeing with delusion in government,
[2:42:22.080 --> 2:42:28.240]  not just in the corporate world, intensify. They really believe the craziness that they're engaged
[2:42:28.240 --> 2:42:34.880]  in. How do you see this unfolding market-wise? I mean, I mean, I keep asking the same question.
[2:42:34.880 --> 2:42:40.320]  How much further can this go historically when it finally does shake out? Where are we going
[2:42:40.320 --> 2:42:45.120]  to be? What is it going to look like when the dust settles? Well, I mean, I think if they continue
[2:42:45.120 --> 2:42:51.120]  on the path they're on, I think this will be prolonged. It'll be worse than what happened
[2:42:51.120 --> 2:42:55.200]  to Japan. And I see no reason that they won't continue on this path. Obama, the other day,
[2:42:55.200 --> 2:42:59.600]  when they were telling him, hey, the economy is still in the toilet, what do you think about that?
[2:42:59.600 --> 2:43:03.200]  And he said, well, don't worry. We've got more stimulus money coming down the pipeline. So
[2:43:03.200 --> 2:43:07.600]  he never thinks, nor do any of them ever think, that the problem is we've had too much of a
[2:43:07.600 --> 2:43:11.680]  destructive policy. It's always that we haven't had enough of it. We've got to just keep doing it.
[2:43:11.680 --> 2:43:16.320]  And one of the points I make in Meltdown is this totally forgotten episode in American history.
[2:43:16.320 --> 2:43:21.360]  Nobody remembers there was a depression in the year 1920. And the reason we don't remember it
[2:43:21.360 --> 2:43:26.560]  is that the Fed was still so young. It hardly even knew how to operate yet. It wasn't doing open
[2:43:26.560 --> 2:43:32.000]  market operations. The Fed stayed out of it. The federal budget was cut in half in two years.
[2:43:32.000 --> 2:43:35.920]  And the result was you had a very quick, robust recovery. Now, that's the exact opposite of what
[2:43:35.920 --> 2:43:39.440]  we're told today. We're told today the government needs to get more power, needs to spend more
[2:43:39.440 --> 2:43:42.960]  money, it needs to inflate, needs to do all this stuff, because otherwise we'll have a disaster.
[2:43:42.960 --> 2:43:47.440]  Well, to the contrary, the one time we had a chance to do the opposite of this, we were out of it
[2:43:47.440 --> 2:43:53.680]  before you know it. But meanwhile, they are doing the very opposite of what makes sense. And they're
[2:43:53.680 --> 2:43:58.880]  doing exactly the same things that have now given Japan, and the last quarter annualized Japan's
[2:43:58.880 --> 2:44:05.520]  economy, shrank by over 15%. I mean, you expect to hear that out of Haiti or Zimbabwe. This is Japan.
[2:44:05.520 --> 2:44:09.760]  And they've done everything that Geithner and all the so-called experts tell them to do. It is
[2:44:09.760 --> 2:44:14.720]  long past time we dispense with these so-called experts. We not feel intimidated by these people.
[2:44:14.720 --> 2:44:21.200]  These are morons. When it comes to economics, we should have confidence that if you just sit down,
[2:44:21.200 --> 2:44:25.440]  and one thing I'm good at, I mean, I'm bad at a lot of things, but one thing I'm good at is
[2:44:25.440 --> 2:44:29.520]  explaining this stuff so the average person can get it. And a lot of people read Meltdown. They
[2:44:29.520 --> 2:44:34.640]  say, you know, I understand this so clearly now. Why is it impossible for these people to get it?
[2:44:34.640 --> 2:44:37.520]  And then, of course, that leads to a deeper question.
[2:44:37.520 --> 2:44:42.880]  Well, Tom, we know why. They're crazy like a fox. There's a method to the madness.
[2:44:42.880 --> 2:44:47.040]  I've read the IMF World Bank documents as I'm sure you have. I mean, they know what they're doing.
[2:44:47.040 --> 2:44:52.640]  They give us all the risk. They get all the profit. And they love wrecking economies, you know,
[2:44:52.640 --> 2:44:57.520]  controlled command destruction. And it was great for the oligarchs in Russia when everything fell
[2:44:57.520 --> 2:45:02.880]  apart there. They got great power. It's great for these oligarchs. And it's like George Soros said,
[2:45:02.880 --> 2:45:07.360]  I'm having a great crisis. I love it. This is the culmination of my life. Close quote.
[2:45:08.320 --> 2:45:12.240]  They know what they're doing. And as everything implodes, then all we've got is government. It
[2:45:12.240 --> 2:45:17.920]  becomes the central pillar. And so I want you to speak to that. But then also, there's two schools
[2:45:17.920 --> 2:45:22.080]  of thought and solution. I believe in the Austrian school. I know you're right. I've studied the
[2:45:22.080 --> 2:45:26.480]  history. But we're already so far down the road of big government and crony capitalism,
[2:45:26.480 --> 2:45:32.560]  monopoly capitalism, that if we're going to have 14.8 trillion pumped out in the last seven months,
[2:45:32.560 --> 2:45:38.160]  if that would have gone to big work projects and to things on the main street real economy,
[2:45:38.160 --> 2:45:42.560]  it'd still be a big debt and inflation and the wrong way to go. But it'd be a lot better than
[2:45:42.560 --> 2:45:50.160]  pumping it off shore to speculators to then buy barges of oil and park it off of, you know,
[2:45:50.160 --> 2:45:55.440]  park it off of islands of the Mediterranean as JP Morgan's doing to then jack up gas prices with
[2:45:55.440 --> 2:46:00.320]  artificially. So we then pay a tax to them on that. I sure know that if we're going to have
[2:46:00.320 --> 2:46:06.400]  14.7 trillion and it's our money of fiat currency, I mean, Bloomberg reported all the
[2:46:06.400 --> 2:46:10.160]  mortgages in the country were nine and a half trillion. With this 14 trillion, we could have
[2:46:10.160 --> 2:46:14.400]  paid off all our mortgages. I mean, I think that's the message to the little socialist,
[2:46:14.400 --> 2:46:20.080]  the little blue collar people that don't understand this that, hey, they took your money off shore.
[2:46:20.080 --> 2:46:24.240]  Now go ahead. Well, I mean, and of course, then we have the additional problem that
[2:46:24.240 --> 2:46:29.280]  with a lot of this money that has apparently been created or spent or who knows what,
[2:46:29.280 --> 2:46:34.720]  we actually don't even know the exact recipients. And I'm sure you saw the video a couple months
[2:46:34.720 --> 2:46:40.000]  ago when there was a Democratic representative from Florida questioning the laughably titled
[2:46:40.000 --> 2:46:44.720]  Inspector General at the Fed. I mean, talk about an absurd title, Inspector General,
[2:46:44.720 --> 2:46:48.560]  like there's any inspecting going on. And he asked her, can you account for some of these
[2:46:48.560 --> 2:46:52.320]  trillions? I mean, we're just kind of wondering if you can just give us the exact recipients,
[2:46:52.320 --> 2:46:55.680]  who got what, what collateral was accepted? She didn't even understand the question.
[2:46:56.400 --> 2:47:03.840]  And one of the most, I think, rewarding moments, I mean, just really just joy producing moments
[2:47:03.840 --> 2:47:08.880]  of my life and recent years is the, is the realization that there are people out there
[2:47:08.880 --> 2:47:14.000]  who understand what's going on with the Fed and that now it's almost like all the cool people
[2:47:14.000 --> 2:47:18.160]  are anti-fed. You know, I mean, now everybody wants to jump on. Exactly. Once the, once the
[2:47:18.160 --> 2:47:23.760]  veneer of invincibility dissipates and once Ron Paul sort of calling out Bernanke and Senator
[2:47:23.760 --> 2:47:27.840]  Sanders, I'm sure you've seen the clip where Sanders says Bernanke, where's the money and,
[2:47:28.480 --> 2:47:33.680]  and Bernanke says, I'm not going to tell you. Yeah. I mean, it is. So I mean, as, as much as we
[2:47:33.680 --> 2:47:37.280]  you know, are inclined to fall into despair and think, well, you know, everything's shot,
[2:47:37.280 --> 2:47:42.800]  it absolutely isn't because there is a lot that an enraged populace can do. And if this crisis
[2:47:42.800 --> 2:47:48.000]  really continues to snowball and really barrels out of control, there's no group that can control
[2:47:48.000 --> 2:47:53.760]  an economy that totally collapses. Then, then, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's anything can
[2:47:53.760 --> 2:47:58.240]  happen if it's a situation like that. But in the short run, people are starting to ask some good
[2:47:58.240 --> 2:48:03.120]  questions and we might even get, or at least we might even get an audit of the Fed. And as Ron
[2:48:03.120 --> 2:48:08.400]  Paul puts it, no matter how that debate turns out, it is a victory because if we get the
[2:48:08.400 --> 2:48:14.000]  audit, that's great. But if they veto this bill, well, in a way that's also good because then
[2:48:14.000 --> 2:48:17.920]  that just encourages more suspicion. People are going to say, well, no way, but what, what are
[2:48:17.920 --> 2:48:22.080]  you hiding? Exactly. No, no, that's even better. I mean, we're trying to pass up with everything
[2:48:22.080 --> 2:48:26.880]  we've got, but if they covered it up right as we get to the trunk that's stinking to high heaven,
[2:48:26.880 --> 2:48:31.200]  we're looking for the dead body and the guy's got blood on his hands. I mean, yeah, exactly. Then
[2:48:31.200 --> 2:48:38.000]  everybody starts asking, why are you so secretive? And meanwhile we've, and to me, the amazing thing
[2:48:38.000 --> 2:48:42.400]  is here we've got a supposedly free press. I'm sure you know all about this, but we've got a
[2:48:42.400 --> 2:48:47.200]  supposedly free press. They have a chance, the media, to interview Ben freaking Bernanke
[2:48:47.200 --> 2:48:51.520]  on 60 minutes. So you'll think, oh, here will be some really great investigative journalism,
[2:48:51.520 --> 2:48:55.200]  right? Well, instead, the reporter walks into the Fed building and he looks around, he says,
[2:48:55.200 --> 2:49:00.960]  oh, wow, they don't build buildings like this anymore. I mean, total lap dog pathetic loser.
[2:49:00.960 --> 2:49:05.280]  And then instead of asking Bernanke, well, let's see, everything you've said has been wrong for
[2:49:05.280 --> 2:49:09.600]  the last three years. You told us there was no housing bubble, the mortgage market was great,
[2:49:09.600 --> 2:49:12.880]  things were going to turn around. Like every single thing you've said is wrong. So why would
[2:49:12.880 --> 2:49:17.280]  we want to listen to you now? Instead, the questions were like, gee, what's your biggest
[2:49:17.280 --> 2:49:20.880]  concern? You know, so it was like Katie Couric interviewing Hillary Clinton.
[2:49:20.880 --> 2:49:26.880]  Oh, you care about us. Tell us how you're trying to save us. You need more power? We've been bad?
[2:49:28.240 --> 2:49:33.440]  That's what we get in what was once a free society. We get this type of thing where
[2:49:33.440 --> 2:49:37.440]  it is the media's role. All these journalists come out of the proctor school of journalism,
[2:49:37.440 --> 2:49:42.880]  and it's their job not to actually ask questions that would embarrass anybody,
[2:49:42.880 --> 2:49:47.120]  or would be difficult for them to answer, but to ask questions that flatter them,
[2:49:47.120 --> 2:49:52.400]  make them look smart, make them look indispensable so that we'll all just helplessly cling to the
[2:49:52.400 --> 2:49:56.560]  issue. Well, that's another issue. Obama cannot talk without his teleprompter. Look at you,
[2:49:56.560 --> 2:50:01.520]  running a million miles an hour. I am Ron Paul. All of us that love liberty, we can talk. We got
[2:50:01.520 --> 2:50:05.520]  our facts in history. And when you really talk to Bernanke and others, and I've been around them,
[2:50:05.520 --> 2:50:11.040]  I've confronted them and others, they are themselves, these little tight little, you know,
[2:50:11.040 --> 2:50:17.520]  cards close to the chest. They won't answer any questions. I mean, it's really just a big, stinking
[2:50:17.520 --> 2:50:22.240]  edifice that needs to come down. Absolutely. And I mean, imagine, now, thankfully, there is
[2:50:22.240 --> 2:50:27.520]  alternative media that is, of course, popping up everywhere. That's wonderful. If we had in the
[2:50:27.520 --> 2:50:34.240]  mainstream media, if we had one tenth of the investigative instinct, just think of what,
[2:50:34.240 --> 2:50:38.880]  how different a country would be. But the private Federal Reserve funds all the big
[2:50:38.880 --> 2:50:44.560]  mega corporations that own the media and a military industrial complex. So when 60 minutes was
[2:50:44.560 --> 2:50:53.120]  literally guarding its financial emperor, who it works for. So there is no impartial, impartiality
[2:50:53.120 --> 2:50:58.080]  there. And let's talk about the media bailout, where the government's going to fund the newspapers
[2:50:58.080 --> 2:51:06.240]  and TV. I mean, this is getting crazy. Spring is here. Growing season. The economy is not getting
[2:51:06.240 --> 2:51:12.000]  any better. In fact, it's getting worse. Think about it. At this rate, how will your life be
[2:51:12.000 --> 2:51:17.440]  in a month or even a year? Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.

[2:54:21.120 --> 2:54:27.520]  Unlike the government, we don't come and forcibly take your money and then use it against you.
[2:54:27.520 --> 2:54:32.640]  We don't come forcibly take your money and give it to private corporations. We ask you to buy the
[2:54:32.640 --> 2:54:37.600]  books and videos and materials at infoawards.com so we can operate it against the big corporate media
[2:54:37.600 --> 2:54:43.120]  that uses your tax money against you. We have the once a year money bomb, second annual,
[2:54:43.120 --> 2:54:48.560]  raised $280,000 and a little bit more still coming in. That will really help us expand
[2:54:48.560 --> 2:54:52.240]  everything we're doing and I commend all of you. God bless you. You're going to see big changes
[2:54:52.240 --> 2:54:55.920]  in the next year like you've seen in the last. We're going to have our guests with us five
[2:54:55.920 --> 2:54:59.680]  minutes to the next hour so I can play a two minute clip, the clip he mentioned where the
[2:54:59.680 --> 2:55:05.040]  solicitor general of the private fellow reserve has asked where the trillions go and she says,
[2:55:05.040 --> 2:55:11.600]  I don't know, which of course isn't true. But now we're openly not just seeing the government spend
[2:55:11.600 --> 2:55:17.600]  tens of billions a year for fake newscasts, buying reporters, these news packages that were secret.
[2:55:17.600 --> 2:55:21.200]  Now they're openly saying they're going to bail out the media. I mean,
[2:55:21.200 --> 2:55:27.200]  how about a bailout for the taxpayers, sir? Exactly. I mean, particularly on this media
[2:55:27.200 --> 2:55:33.200]  question, how in the world could you possibly have a free media when they know they're going to get,
[2:55:33.200 --> 2:55:36.320]  they might have a chance to get a bailout? Who's going to want to criticize the government now?
[2:55:36.320 --> 2:55:40.960]  If you know money could be coming, if you shut up and toe the line, it's unbelievable that
[2:55:40.960 --> 2:55:47.520]  anyone could conceivably support this. I've asked all my questions. I know there's a lot of other
[2:55:47.520 --> 2:55:52.400]  points that are important. What are other areas? I mean, you've got all the evidence there and in
[2:55:52.400 --> 2:55:58.320]  your book of where they do things that make the economy worse. Well, let me just first make a
[2:55:58.320 --> 2:56:02.640]  quick comment about the inspector general, the fed, the clip that you've got there. I think this,
[2:56:02.640 --> 2:56:06.560]  if you actually, if you watch this woman, she genuinely, either she's going to, she should win
[2:56:06.560 --> 2:56:12.960]  an Academy Award or she genuinely doesn't understand this stuff. Whatever the case is,
[2:56:12.960 --> 2:56:18.880]  she's a liar or ignorant. It shows an unbelievable contempt for the public. It really shows the
[2:56:18.880 --> 2:56:24.400]  fed's total contempt that they would produce this woman who can't answer a single question
[2:56:24.400 --> 2:56:30.240]  or refuses to answer even the simplest sort of question. It's just astonishing. But my argument
[2:56:30.240 --> 2:56:35.920]  of one of my points in Meltdown, and incidentally, while we're on the media question, Meltdown has
[2:56:35.920 --> 2:56:40.080]  got a forward by Ron Paul, the only person in the 100 miles of Washington with any credibility
[2:56:40.080 --> 2:56:44.480]  on this is the New York Times bestseller for 10 weeks. The New York Times, my publisher tells me,
[2:56:44.480 --> 2:56:48.640]  has refused to review it, even though it is customary for them to review bestsellers. The
[2:56:48.640 --> 2:56:52.560]  book calls out the fed and all this stuff. Anybody can get it, so they won't review it.
[2:56:52.560 --> 2:56:56.400]  The last time, the only other time they did review a book of mine was the politically
[2:56:56.400 --> 2:57:00.640]  incorrect Guide to American History. And I'm sure they realized that after they condemned it,
[2:57:00.640 --> 2:57:05.600]  everybody bought it. So needless to say, they can't mention it at all. But the New York Times,
[2:57:05.600 --> 2:57:10.640]  without some type of bailout, is clearly going down. I mean, if they're going to need some type
[2:57:10.640 --> 2:57:16.320]  of bailout, and I hope it never comes, it couldn't be, I mean, really, it couldn't be more richly
[2:57:16.320 --> 2:57:22.080]  deserved. But one of my arguments, and it's not exclusive to me, is that the very existence
[2:57:22.080 --> 2:57:26.880]  of the fed, the very fact that you have one, increases what we call moral hazard. In other
[2:57:26.880 --> 2:57:31.440]  words, it makes people do riskier things than they otherwise would do. And in particular,
[2:57:31.440 --> 2:57:37.520]  ever since especially the late 90s, when there was a hedge fund called Long Term Capital Management,
[2:57:37.520 --> 2:57:41.840]  that's a bad name. You would not want this hedge fund to managing your long term capital. But
[2:57:41.840 --> 2:57:45.760]  anyway, Alan Greenspan bailed this thing out when things went sour.
[2:57:45.760 --> 2:57:49.360]  Yeah, that was the, the, the mathematic geniuses that were invincible.
[2:57:49.360 --> 2:57:54.720]  Yeah. Oh yeah. So absolutely invincible. And then bang, the, the economy gave its verdict.
[2:57:54.720 --> 2:57:59.120]  Well, after he did that, of course, what did that make Lehman do? What did that make Merrill
[2:57:59.120 --> 2:58:03.760]  Lynch do? All made him get 10 times more reckless. Exactly. So I mean, what, again, and then
[2:58:03.760 --> 2:58:07.040]  meanwhile, this is all blamed on the free market. And we should blame it on the fact
[2:58:07.040 --> 2:58:12.880]  that we've got this monopolistic entity that is, and again, there is this sort of superstition
[2:58:12.880 --> 2:58:18.480]  that the fed is there for the common person. Come on. It's there to bail out the big guys.
[2:58:18.480 --> 2:58:22.880]  That's why it's there. Absolutely amazing. Final segment with our guest. We're going to come back
[2:58:22.880 --> 2:58:28.480]  and just play a minute or two of him asking her and she's just bumbling around and can't answer
[2:58:28.480 --> 2:58:32.720]  anything. You'll hear a bunch of this weird corporate doubles speak about, is there a review
[2:58:32.720 --> 2:58:37.920]  of this? And that's coming up in one minute as we start the final hour. Stay with us.

[2:58:51.120 --> 2:58:55.760]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[2:58:55.760 --> 2:58:59.920]  this summer. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[2:58:59.920 --> 2:59:05.200]  bill. Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[2:59:05.200 --> 2:59:09.840]  allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[2:59:09.840 --> 2:59:14.400]  grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is
[2:59:14.400 --> 2:59:18.480]  dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead. Number four,
[2:59:18.480 --> 2:59:22.880]  the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again. Every year, thousands of families
[2:59:22.880 --> 2:59:27.680]  lose their power from weather related outages. Number five, a solar power generator provides
[2:59:27.680 --> 2:59:32.320]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[2:59:32.320 --> 2:59:36.880]  offered by Solutions from Science, a long time sponsor of ours. You can get more information

[2:59:54.000 --> 2:59:59.200]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCM radio network.
[2:59:59.200 --> 3:00:17.680]  By the way, I have gotten so obsessed with the North Korea situation in Iran, and I've forgotten
[3:00:17.680 --> 3:00:23.440]  it's our top story today like a fool the last three hours. The DOD training manual describes
[3:00:23.440 --> 3:00:29.360]  protest, all protest, as low-level terrorism, and the Army's declassified documents that I
[3:00:30.080 --> 3:00:36.880]  am watched by the U.S. Army at my events, and so is Ron Paul. And Ron Paul just kind of nicely
[3:00:36.880 --> 3:00:41.680]  shrugs it off, but that's coming up. We have these in the Fed rallies. They have Army intelligence
[3:00:41.680 --> 3:00:47.280]  there. The new Breaking Mainstream News will cover that, and we've got just a few minutes left with
[3:00:47.280 --> 3:00:53.840]  Tom Woods, TomWords.com, the Lubig von Mies Institute best-selling author. But let's go
[3:00:53.840 --> 3:00:58.080]  ahead and play these two minutes with this clip. This is the selector general, the investigator
[3:00:58.080 --> 3:01:05.920]  of the Fed investigating itself, bumbling around. Here it is. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
[3:01:07.360 --> 3:01:10.720]  Inspector Coleman, you're the inspector general for the Federal Reserve, right?
[3:01:12.240 --> 3:01:15.680]  Okay. That's correct. Have you done any investigations concerning the Federal
[3:01:15.680 --> 3:01:20.560]  Reserve's role in deciding not to save Lehman Brothers, which led to shock waves that went
[3:01:20.560 --> 3:01:28.880]  through the entire financial system? In that particular area, I don't generally comment
[3:01:28.880 --> 3:01:33.840]  on specific investigations, but we do not currently have an investigation in that particular area.
[3:01:34.880 --> 3:01:40.880]  All right. What about the $1 trillion plus in expansion of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet
[3:01:40.880 --> 3:01:47.280]  since last September? Have you conducted any investigations regarding that? Right now, we
[3:01:47.280 --> 3:01:54.720]  have a, it's called, we call it a review, and if you could determine investigation, they have
[3:01:54.720 --> 3:02:01.040]  different connotations. So we're actually conducting a fairly high-level review of the various lending
[3:02:01.040 --> 3:02:07.760]  facilities collectively, which would include the TALF, a variety of the different programs
[3:02:07.760 --> 3:02:10.800]  that are in process. So we're looking at them at a fairly high level to identify risk.
[3:02:11.680 --> 3:02:16.560]  Well, I understand that, but we're talking about events that started unfolding eight months ago.
[3:02:16.560 --> 3:02:21.680]  Have you reached any conclusions about the Fed expanding its balance sheet by over a
[3:02:21.680 --> 3:02:25.520]  trillion dollars since last September? We have not yet reached any conclusions.
[3:02:25.520 --> 3:02:26.880]  Do you know who received that money?
[3:02:29.440 --> 3:02:35.360]  For the, we're in the process right now of doing our review and...
[3:02:35.360 --> 3:02:41.360]  Right, but you're the Inspector General. My question to you specifically is, do you know
[3:02:41.360 --> 3:02:46.560]  who received that $1 trillion plus that the Fed extended and put on its balance sheet since
[3:02:46.560 --> 3:02:49.120]  last September? Do you know the identity of the recipients?
[3:02:49.120 --> 3:02:55.040]  I do not know. We have not looked at that specific area at this particular point on those reviews.
[3:02:57.840 --> 3:03:03.440]  What about Bloomberg's report that there are trillions of dollars in off-balance sheets
[3:03:03.440 --> 3:03:08.080]  transactions that the Federal Reserve has entered into since last September?
[3:03:08.640 --> 3:03:11.360]  Are you familiar with those off-balance sheet transactions?
[3:03:12.320 --> 3:03:18.720]  You know, I think it may be important at this point too, just to bring up a certain
[3:03:18.720 --> 3:03:21.280]  aspect related to our jurisdiction. And just to...
[3:03:21.840 --> 3:03:26.160]  All right, let's just go ahead and go back. The Inspector General has no jurisdiction over
[3:03:26.160 --> 3:03:30.800]  who the Fed's giving money to in closing, Mr. Woods, your comments on what you just heard.
[3:03:30.800 --> 3:03:35.840]  Well, when my wife showed this to me the other night, and I know there are a lot of us who would
[3:03:35.840 --> 3:03:39.600]  kill to have a wife who digs out anti-Fed videos, and I'm telling you, I got one.
[3:03:40.480 --> 3:03:45.680]  And when I heard this thing, I thought, this is the best video in favor of auditing the Fed.
[3:03:45.680 --> 3:03:49.920]  I've ever seen. It's almost like, you know, it's almost like I made it, and she's an actress.
[3:03:51.040 --> 3:03:57.200]  It is astonishing that, as I say, either she's ignorant or she is sinister, but this is the
[3:03:57.200 --> 3:04:02.400]  person they put out when they know we've got serious questions. Well, my view is the party
[3:04:02.400 --> 3:04:08.480]  is starting to end. It's been almost a century for the Fed, but people are starting to cotton
[3:04:08.480 --> 3:04:13.280]  onto it, and it has not happened a moment too soon for me. So it's not going to live to 100.
[3:04:14.160 --> 3:04:19.760]  It's 97, 98 years old right now, and it's time to fill this rotten tree that's endangering the
[3:04:19.760 --> 3:04:24.640]  entire house. I'd love to do it. I don't know if we'll do it in time for 100 years. I don't know
[3:04:24.640 --> 3:04:29.040]  when it'll happen, but I do think it will happen. No, I hope this, it's getting along in the tooth.
[3:04:29.040 --> 3:04:33.760]  This parasite needs to be removed from our, it's like a two pound tick on a one pound dog.
[3:04:33.760 --> 3:04:37.760]  Melt down a free market look at why the stock market collapse economy tank, the government
[3:04:37.760 --> 3:04:41.840]  bailouts will make things worse. I look forward to talking to you again, sir. Amazing interview,

[3:04:46.880 --> 3:04:50.720]  him on. Very informative. So there, that's the answer to all you out there that think we need
[3:04:50.720 --> 3:04:55.040]  to have more government as a solution. Now I agree with Tarpley. If we're going to have trillion
[3:04:55.040 --> 3:05:21.360]  spent, might as well give it to the people, but that's not going to happen. We'll be right back.

[3:08:35.760 --> 3:08:41.040]  all the other news and believe me it's crazy. Very important information coming up. Gregory Hoover,
[3:08:41.040 --> 3:08:52.160]  HooverVersusBeck.com is the website. HooverBigFatV versus Beck.com is the website. His email address
[3:08:52.160 --> 3:08:58.320]  is HooverVersusBeckatYalu.com. And he's suing Beck and Fox staff for defaming of character
[3:08:59.440 --> 3:09:05.280]  regarding Becks for March, linking 9-11 truthers with James Vaughn Braun. This guy's linked to
[3:09:05.280 --> 3:09:09.920]  the government. We've been to the National Press Club over the weekend and yesterday. I'm just
[3:09:09.920 --> 3:09:14.640]  going to leave it at that. We're in contact with reporters confirming leads we got here. We sent
[3:09:14.640 --> 3:09:19.440]  people to D.C. for this and had them do an interview with other people while they were on it.
[3:09:21.920 --> 3:09:26.400]  Wayne Madsen but the separate from Wayne Madsen and we're working on it. We want to be careful
[3:09:26.400 --> 3:09:32.880]  before we release something like this. But no, as usual it's the FBI. They're good old boy around
[3:09:32.880 --> 3:09:39.920]  it. Remember that 1992 video of them lynching blacks in effigy and thousands of FBI and BETF agents
[3:09:39.920 --> 3:09:45.520]  selling inward hunting licenses? You'd think they're just infiltrating white supremacists,
[3:09:45.520 --> 3:09:49.600]  but it's more than that. They are the white supremacists. It's very... And they work for
[3:09:49.600 --> 3:09:54.880]  a bunch of weird ADL people. It's so bizarre when you get to the highest rooms of the New World Order.
[3:09:54.880 --> 3:10:04.240]  Well, it's like the Jewish Congress mainline news in the Ottawa citizen, the big Ottawa
[3:10:04.240 --> 3:10:09.360]  newspaper, the capital city newspaper reporting what we already knew, started the Nazi party in
[3:10:09.360 --> 3:10:17.600]  65 in Canada and the London Guardian reports the modern Nazi party in 69 was founded in Germany
[3:10:17.600 --> 3:10:22.880]  by the German security services. They don't go out and infiltrate the groups. They run them. They
[3:10:22.880 --> 3:10:28.080]  are them. I mean, it's just... And you find out it's not just to infiltrate white supremacists,
[3:10:28.080 --> 3:10:37.680]  they are. Whoever made so crazy. Truth is always so much crazier than you can even imagine.
[3:10:39.200 --> 3:10:43.760]  But how does the ADL... How does the Southern Prairie Law Center... How do they survive if
[3:10:43.760 --> 3:10:49.600]  they don't have Nazis? Oh, it's very sick. It's very sick. That's why I'm hated by the ADL's
[3:10:49.600 --> 3:10:54.880]  Southern Prairie Law Center and the Nazis. Well, I mean, look, they give Arnold awards for
[3:10:54.880 --> 3:10:59.840]  worshipping Hitler, saying he wants to be like Hitler and, you know, wants to be a dictator. But
[3:10:59.840 --> 3:11:06.880]  side issue, Greg Hoover is going to be suing the above described defendants in federal court
[3:11:06.880 --> 3:11:10.240]  for BEX having repeatedly broadcast statements characterizing those who question government
[3:11:10.240 --> 3:11:16.240]  official version of 9-11 as anarchist, terrorist and persons denying the Holocaust. He said before
[3:11:16.240 --> 3:11:21.360]  use the army on us, the complaint will note that on October 22, 2007, BEX suggested that those
[3:11:21.360 --> 3:11:25.200]  identifying themselves or associated with 9-11 truth movement are dangerous anarchists who
[3:11:25.200 --> 3:11:31.040]  deny the Holocaust and are the kind of group the Timothy McVeigh would come from. The suit will
[3:11:31.040 --> 3:11:36.320]  also note that BEX during the June 10th broadcast linked the murder of the D.C. Holocaust Museum
[3:11:36.320 --> 3:11:42.400]  guard with 9-11 truthers with no evidence. As he's previously written, suing people for defamation
[3:11:42.400 --> 3:11:46.560]  who falsely claim that 9-11 activists or terrorists could be a good way to stand up to these bullies.
[3:11:47.280 --> 3:11:51.200]  Yeah, you don't see the Southern Prairie Law Center when I linked them with federal documents
[3:11:51.200 --> 3:11:55.120]  to running the white supremacist compound that McVeigh came out of at L.A.M. City.
[3:11:55.120 --> 3:11:58.480]  You don't see him coming after me. Go ahead, come after me. You've already done it.
[3:11:59.200 --> 3:12:04.880]  Behind the scenes, when some nut kills cops, you go look at his computer, thousands of sites he's
[3:12:04.880 --> 3:12:11.120]  visited. You find out he didn't like me and was attacking me. And then you feed that to the news
[3:12:11.120 --> 3:12:16.800]  media. See, folks, they know I know, but it's too late. You're going to shut down the Ottawa
[3:12:16.800 --> 3:12:26.960]  citizen? You're going to shut down CNN reporting on it now? Oh, the big secrets out. Oh, and the
[3:12:26.960 --> 3:12:35.760]  Miami Herald about how the top Nazi rallies are run by the FBI, run by you. I've had it.
[3:12:35.760 --> 3:12:43.760]  You won our First Amendment and you're not getting it. I'm calling you out. You're sick.
[3:12:43.760 --> 3:12:49.040]  Stop your Nazi activity. Stop spreading racism and then acting like you're trying to clean it up
[3:12:49.040 --> 3:12:53.920]  and fix it. We don't want to be at each other's throats anymore. We don't want to play your game
[3:12:53.920 --> 3:12:58.800]  anymore. We want to take down the New World Order. Stop trying to hang the name Jew on everything
[3:12:58.800 --> 3:13:03.360]  too to make people come after Jews so then the ADL could sit there and suck off of them with
[3:13:03.360 --> 3:13:09.840]  donations. We know how you work and met General Raza saying for our race, everything for those
[3:13:09.840 --> 3:13:15.760]  outside the race, nothing. U.S. government funded funding every racist group out there. We're sick
[3:13:15.760 --> 3:13:23.600]  of you. We know your game plan and we're calling it out. And all you idiot Nazis that follow these
[3:13:23.600 --> 3:13:29.360]  groups, you need to stop doing what you're doing. You're a bunch of fools. All right, I'm going to
[3:13:29.360 --> 3:13:32.880]  stop right there. Let's go to Gregory Hoover. Gregory, I may hold you over a little bit. I'm
[3:13:32.880 --> 3:13:39.680]  sorry I went into Iran. So you're suing Lord Beck for saying we're violent terrorists, which is
[3:13:39.680 --> 3:13:46.640]  dangerous for us. How about Sue Michael Reagan saying murder 9-11 truth or something? That's
[3:13:46.640 --> 3:13:52.320]  what's really dangerous. Well, that's a good point, Alex. I want to thank you first for having me
[3:13:52.320 --> 3:14:00.800]  on the show today. And there's good reason to lay suit to libel and defamation, in my opinion,
[3:14:00.800 --> 3:14:07.440]  on many of the media that are involved in this, I think, conspiracy itself to...
[3:14:07.440 --> 3:14:13.440]  Smericant, then, yeah. Posteriority to fame. Anyone that's associated with the 9-11 movement,
[3:14:13.440 --> 3:14:20.800]  I think that we're now at a present point in this process of exposure as to the government
[3:14:20.800 --> 3:14:27.440]  involvement in the exactivity. That desperate attempts are being made to try to cause the
[3:14:27.440 --> 3:14:34.160]  general public to disassociate themselves with anyone who is attempting to try to pass along
[3:14:34.160 --> 3:14:39.600]  this overabundance as well. Yeah, I would imagine the feds are setting up child molesters
[3:14:39.600 --> 3:14:44.160]  for 9-11 truth right now or something. It's not going to work. Well, they're really stretching
[3:14:44.160 --> 3:14:48.480]  it, and I think it gets to the point of it being ridiculously incredible that they would
[3:14:48.480 --> 3:14:56.960]  have, along with back on his program of June 10th here this past week, and a claimed
[3:14:58.000 --> 3:15:05.680]  ex-CIA agent to put out this misinformation as to the association of 9-11 truth.
[3:15:05.680 --> 3:15:11.920]  Yeah, as if that supposedly gives it authoritative seal. As if that totally... The CIA's not supposed
[3:15:11.920 --> 3:15:16.800]  to be involved in our internal politics, and now they're running radio ads everywhere. Sorry,
[3:15:16.800 --> 3:15:21.360]  go ahead. Well, yeah, I mean, first of all, begs the question of why he's a former agent.
[3:15:21.360 --> 3:15:29.440]  It doesn't look as if he's a retirement agent. It seems to me that it exposes what a plant,
[3:15:29.440 --> 3:15:34.560]  I believe, at this point, Glenn Beck is, and continues to be, in the media mainstream.
[3:15:35.280 --> 3:15:41.520]  It's a great concern with me that he's now gotten to the point that he will so blatantly
[3:15:41.520 --> 3:15:48.880]  defame persons associated with the 9-11 movement. Well, Greg, I think you have a right to do this.
[3:15:50.480 --> 3:15:54.960]  I mean, I just don't... I'm afraid it could turn him into a hero, and he'll say,
[3:15:54.960 --> 3:15:59.840]  the Nazis are suing me, but then I guess you have an even bigger lawsuit against him.
[3:16:01.120 --> 3:16:05.760]  They'll just put another CIA guy in, but I mean, maybe that'll at least make him think twice
[3:16:05.760 --> 3:16:09.120]  next time. I mean, I lean towards your suit. I think it has some standing,
[3:16:09.120 --> 3:16:14.080]  but you seem like a pretty well-educated guy. I mean, why are you suing? Why do you think you have
[3:16:14.080 --> 3:16:21.280]  grounds? Well, I think that when it gets to the point that... If he attempts to argue against
[3:16:22.080 --> 3:16:28.800]  the factual basis for the movement with regard to the evidence, which is now being put forth
[3:16:28.800 --> 3:16:34.960]  by 9-11 truthers, that's one thing. But when he attempts to categorize group persons that
[3:16:34.960 --> 3:16:42.320]  associate them with hate speech, which I'm now pretty much considering him to being provided here,
[3:16:42.320 --> 3:16:50.800]  or to providing, then I think he steps over a line. I think that at this point, when someone
[3:16:50.800 --> 3:17:01.280]  such as himself begins a campaign that is so blatantly targeting persons in specific groups
[3:17:01.280 --> 3:17:07.920]  where we have to kind of back up a little bit in recognizing that. He's not going after individuals
[3:17:07.920 --> 3:17:16.720]  where typically defamation cases might lie. Instead, he's formulating his own image or
[3:17:16.720 --> 3:17:22.560]  mischaracterization, mischaracterization of persons who are associating themselves with
[3:17:22.560 --> 3:17:30.160]  these organizations and associations. He's persecuting what he sees as a minority group,
[3:17:30.160 --> 3:17:36.640]  like Hitler with the Jews, I guess, with a demonization campaign, broad brush, with a powerful
[3:17:36.640 --> 3:17:44.880]  bully pulpit. There would be grounds to sue if he said all Native Americans support white supremacist
[3:17:44.880 --> 3:17:50.000]  and al-Qaeda. You better believe he'd be sued by Native American groups and probably lose. The test
[3:17:50.000 --> 3:17:55.920]  is, in the courts will 9-11 truth and the First Amendment be protected like a Native American
[3:17:55.920 --> 3:18:01.680]  group. I think that these groups certainly shall. I think that we can very well now easily establish
[3:18:01.680 --> 3:18:07.440]  that there are individuals who can be and are, and especially in a particular position like this,
[3:18:08.720 --> 3:18:14.480]  personally damaged by myself during the course of business day or in personal relation,
[3:18:14.480 --> 3:18:20.960]  will pass along information relevant to the 9-11 movement. I'm then, in a sense,
[3:18:20.960 --> 3:18:27.040]  you know, publicly, and as well concerning my association, I'm involved in the Orlando,
[3:18:27.040 --> 3:18:32.000]  We Are Change, 9-11 truth movement. My pictures and name is listed on their
[3:18:32.000 --> 3:18:37.040]  publicly and openly listed on their website. And you've now been defamed. You've now been connected
[3:18:37.040 --> 3:18:43.600]  to this lunatic, Ron Brun. Yes, absolutely. Those are my previously considered that I was
[3:18:43.600 --> 3:18:48.960]  merely passing along interesting insights as to the event. You know, it now has me,
[3:18:48.960 --> 3:18:54.480]  there's a stigma now, Ted. Are you kidding? Every show, listen, I was on a radio show this morning,
[3:18:54.480 --> 3:18:59.280]  a radio show last night, and I go on the shows and they ask me, are you with Von Brun? And I go,
[3:18:59.280 --> 3:19:03.120]  why do you say that? And they go, well, Glenn Beck, basically. And I have to sit there and
[3:19:03.120 --> 3:19:08.560]  explain to them how asinine it is and that Von Brun was a World War II vet. Does that mean
[3:19:08.560 --> 3:19:14.240]  all World War II vets shoot security guards at Holocaust museums? I mean, it's just an, but
[3:19:14.240 --> 3:19:20.240]  the credibility of a national news show with the CIA guy, he held it out there like we are,
[3:19:20.960 --> 3:19:25.680]  that we honor him. We bow down at night and pray to Von Brun statues.
[3:19:25.680 --> 3:19:30.400]  Right. In his quote, in fact, from June 10th on that show, Beck, that leaves, he states,
[3:19:30.400 --> 3:19:34.240]  I quote, the information that we have at this point is that this guy, of course, is referring to
[3:19:34.240 --> 3:19:39.440]  Von Brun is a hero to the 9-11 truth movement. Now, there's nothing that he could have provided
[3:19:39.440 --> 3:19:44.320]  or would have been provided. And there's nothing by my research that suggests that that allegation
[3:19:44.320 --> 3:19:50.560]  can be appealed. And again, he continues back with it and runs on again with a quote. And I'll
[3:19:50.560 --> 3:19:54.480]  say he said the early report... Well, stay there, stay there. But I want to get this right. Is it
[3:19:54.480 --> 3:19:59.520]  Von Brun or Von Brun? I've got Von Brun. Yeah, yeah, that's what I think it is. Okay,
[3:19:59.520 --> 3:20:04.320]  we'll be right back. Stay with us. Finally, in the news this evening, it's being reported that
[3:20:04.320 --> 3:20:09.920]  cyber spies from Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid. Even as energy experts
[3:20:09.920 --> 3:20:14.640]  are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid.
[3:20:14.640 --> 3:20:19.840]  Some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge,
[3:20:19.840 --> 3:20:24.800]  creating a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all in the dark.
[3:20:24.800 --> 3:20:30.560]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government-created blackouts? Have you
[3:20:30.560 --> 3:20:35.680]  ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of
[3:20:35.680 --> 3:20:40.640]  electrical power? If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard.
[3:20:40.640 --> 3:20:45.920]  Solar-powered generators are finally available. They have no moving parts to wear out or break
[3:20:45.920 --> 3:20:51.680]  and require absolutely no gas whatsoever. Remember, the government doesn't own the sun,

[3:21:19.600 --> 3:21:26.400]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity

[3:23:00.480 --> 3:23:05.840]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining
[3:23:05.840 --> 3:23:10.800]  high energy and vibrant health. Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH
[3:23:10.800 --> 3:23:16.320]  level of eight or higher. Alchovision plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most
[3:23:16.320 --> 3:23:21.920]  alkaline ingredients. Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline
[3:23:21.920 --> 3:23:26.800]  to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy. Simply put 10 drops per
[3:23:26.800 --> 3:23:32.320]  liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level. Alkalizing water helps your body
[3:23:32.320 --> 3:23:37.680]  rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body. Disease organisms
[3:23:37.680 --> 3:23:43.200]  like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment. Order your bottle
[3:23:43.200 --> 3:23:51.040]  of Alchovision plasma pH drops now by going directly to Alchovision.com. That's AlkaVision.com

[3:24:21.040 --> 3:24:47.840]  All right, Gregory Hoogler. Hooglerversusbeck.com. Just put a V.S.
[3:24:47.840 --> 3:24:54.560]  in the back. Appreciate you spending time with us. Okay, so in closing, I'm going out to break
[3:24:54.560 --> 3:25:00.800]  there. You're saying you're being persecuted and clearly we are. Isn't it suspect that they kept
[3:25:00.800 --> 3:25:04.720]  saying we're white supremacists? We're going to attack. When none of that had happened for years
[3:25:04.720 --> 3:25:11.440]  and he'd say, mark my words. I love America. I'm glad back. It's going to happen. And then
[3:25:11.440 --> 3:25:15.680]  magically it happens. And well, this goes back to his other quote earlier in the same program
[3:25:15.680 --> 3:25:20.160]  where he said, one of the things that I've been warning about for a very, very long time
[3:25:20.160 --> 3:25:24.320]  are these 9-11 truthers. They've been waiting for an opportunity for something along these lines
[3:25:24.320 --> 3:25:31.440]  to occur so that they attempt to try to penetrate. The week before that, he was saying that 9-11
[3:25:31.440 --> 3:25:38.560]  truthers and people and militias were working for the Muslims with anthrax and were going to kill
[3:25:38.560 --> 3:25:44.480]  300,000. And he said, I've been warning you a long time about this unholy alliance. Let's turn to
[3:25:44.480 --> 3:25:49.440]  our resident. I mean, made up Bologna. Go ahead. Well, it's gotten to the point now that there's
[3:25:49.440 --> 3:25:56.880]  no stretch of the imagination too far for him to reach to attempt to try to close us in disparaging
[3:25:56.880 --> 3:26:03.040]  ways such that there will be an automatic warding off of those who might otherwise be attracted
[3:26:03.040 --> 3:26:07.520]  to the movement. Yeah, that'd be like I said. Don't watch Glenn Beck. Don't watch Glenn Beck
[3:26:07.520 --> 3:26:11.440]  because he's a child molester. And I don't have any proof of that. I'm just saying it,
[3:26:11.440 --> 3:26:15.200]  seeing that. That's not true, folks. I'm just using that as a hypothetical example.
[3:26:18.400 --> 3:26:22.480]  Yeah, but with him, he's really throwing that out there that we're basically Nazis
[3:26:22.480 --> 3:26:26.800]  and they're not saying it's not true. He's putting it out there to
[3:26:26.800 --> 3:26:31.520]  damage us. So where does this suit go? Well, but there's several things that we're seeking in
[3:26:31.520 --> 3:26:37.840]  this suit among which I'm seeking a temporary and permanent injunction against his attempting to
[3:26:37.840 --> 3:26:44.480]  try to defame us along these group statuses. I'd like to attempt to try to provide an FCC
[3:26:44.480 --> 3:26:54.000]  guideline with regard to these sorts of statements and a standard that I think can benefit defamation
[3:26:54.000 --> 3:26:59.280]  cases along these lines. I think one of the greatest things that can come of this is that
[3:26:59.280 --> 3:27:06.720]  the media attention that this case is now garnering is one which will be recognized not
[3:27:06.720 --> 3:27:11.040]  only by those who are already associated and familiar with the 9-11 movement, but by virtue
[3:27:11.040 --> 3:27:17.840]  of the fact that it will attach itself inherently to Glenn Beck and his followers. It's going to
[3:27:17.840 --> 3:27:22.480]  expose them to the information that they otherwise would otherwise be hidden from the other side
[3:27:22.480 --> 3:27:28.160]  of the court. Now, you sound like a lawyer or are you a lawyer? No, I actually am a CLA. I've been
[3:27:28.160 --> 3:27:33.040]  in the legal profession 20 years. I write a public brief for attorneys. Okay, good. So basically
[3:27:33.040 --> 3:27:36.720]  you're the guy that does the work for the attorneys. But when your high-powered attorney tells you
[3:27:36.720 --> 3:27:42.720]  that he's going to have that memorandum brief or what have you prepared and called tomorrow morning
[3:27:42.720 --> 3:27:48.400]  I might do the guy working it out. I've worked for firms large and small for about two decades.
[3:27:48.400 --> 3:27:53.120]  Well, a better analogy of what Beck's doing is if there was a big bank robbery and a jail guard
[3:27:53.120 --> 3:27:59.600]  got shot or a bank guard got shot and then I went on the radio and said, you know, I don't have any
[3:27:59.600 --> 3:28:06.400]  proof of this, but we're getting evidence that Glenn Beck thought this guy that killed the
[3:28:06.400 --> 3:28:11.840]  bank guard was a hero. Glenn Beck would sue me and rightfully so because there's no connection
[3:28:12.480 --> 3:28:22.080]  to the bank robber and Glenn Beck. Absolutely. And something interesting when you said that it
[3:28:22.080 --> 3:28:26.720]  would seem at this point, you'll notice on that broadcast that you intend if you'll run the tape
[3:28:26.720 --> 3:28:33.440]  it's now all over YouTube that repeatedly he uses the term the early reports suggest any
[3:28:33.440 --> 3:28:38.880]  any attempts to try to throw in his own personal it shows he knows he's lying. It shows me because
[3:28:38.880 --> 3:28:42.880]  yeah, because later on he can come back and say, well, you know, these were early reports that came
[3:28:42.880 --> 3:28:47.360]  in from sources that he now can't verify. Okay. Okay. In closing, where does this go? Where does
[3:28:47.360 --> 3:28:54.160]  the suit go? This suit goes into Middle District Federal Court and the Orlando Division. We're
[3:28:54.160 --> 3:28:58.720]  looking for a class action status, which I believe we'll be able to gain certification of. We're
[3:28:58.720 --> 3:29:02.400]  looking at this point. We recognize, of course, we're going to be up against heavy legal opposition
[3:29:02.400 --> 3:29:07.440]  for the Fox team. So we're looking to put together what I'd consider the legal green team,
[3:29:07.440 --> 3:29:13.920]  which is why I've put up the Hoover versus Beck dot com site. We're looking for donations to
[3:29:13.920 --> 3:29:18.720]  be able to support the effort. We think that during the course of our game gaining a remit
[3:29:18.720 --> 3:29:23.520]  remedy and presenting this challenge to Beck and Fox News to shut them down as best we can.
[3:29:23.520 --> 3:29:31.440]  Certainly, not let Glenn Beck back a notch. We'll be able to gain recognition for the movement.
[3:29:31.440 --> 3:29:35.840]  Well, he is assaulting us with lies, trying to hurt us and trying to defame our free speech.
[3:29:36.400 --> 3:29:40.480]  And I appreciate what you're doing and we'll stand behind you and get reports as it unfolds.

[3:31:02.720 --> 3:31:07.200]  good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer. Number one,
[3:31:07.200 --> 3:31:11.120]  new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two,
[3:31:11.120 --> 3:31:16.320]  our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[3:31:16.320 --> 3:31:21.440]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[3:31:21.440 --> 3:31:25.680]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[3:31:25.680 --> 3:31:29.760]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead. Number four, the hurricane and dangerous
[3:31:29.760 --> 3:31:33.920]  summer storm season is here again. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from
[3:31:33.920 --> 3:31:39.120]  weather related outages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[3:31:39.120 --> 3:31:43.520]  peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from
[3:31:43.520 --> 3:31:50.320]  Science, a longtime sponsor of ours. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[3:32:04.880 --> 3:32:09.120]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than
[3:32:09.120 --> 3:32:13.600]  when drinking the water? That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and
[3:32:13.600 --> 3:32:18.800]  others are absorbed into the skin. The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold
[3:32:18.800 --> 3:32:24.000]  water and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth
[3:32:24.000 --> 3:32:30.400]  of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus. The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons
[3:32:30.400 --> 3:32:34.960]  or one year, whichever comes first. Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities
[3:32:34.960 --> 3:32:39.840]  use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria. What about you? Order your

I've never been with anything less than a nine. So fine. I've been on fire with Sally, feel gone fast with a girl named Bo. But somehow,
[3:33:25.440 --> 3:33:38.640]  they just don't end up as mine. It's a death defying life I lead. I take my chances. I die for living in the movies and TV.
[3:33:40.800 --> 3:33:49.680]  But the hardest thing I ever do is watch my leading ladies kiss some other guy while I'm bandaging my knee.
[3:33:49.680 --> 3:34:19.360]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we've got about 26 minutes left in the World Wide Transmission. I'm going right to your phone calls here in about two minutes. But first, I wanted to let you know about some of the sponsors that have made this World Wide Transmission possible. One of them is survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com. In a real crisis, having non-hybrid seeds means having the ability to grow your endless supply of nutrient-dense food to feed your loved ones. I say buy it and plant it and enjoy it. Still got time for a summer and fall garden.
[3:34:20.480 --> 3:34:35.200]  And stop eating all that GMO crap. It's just fun. Got little kids that they like planting a garden a lot more than they will playing, you know, Devil's Spider-Man games or whatever it is they're doing. Just it's fun to go put in a garden, ladies and gentlemen. The government doesn't like it. It's another reason to do it.
[3:34:35.200 --> 3:35:04.200]  Survivalseedbank.com. The government's buying up all the big seed companies. Foreign companies are doing it, shutting them down. They're trying to make you have licenses to have non-hybrid, non-GMO seeds in Europe. You can't make this stuff up. Survivalseedbank.com. 877-327-0365. 877-327-0365. Survivalseedbank.com.

[3:35:47.200 --> 3:36:02.200]  And lastly, ladies and gentlemen, something I believe firmly in, a lot of antibiotics and antivirals aren't working anymore, but there's something that medical doctors on this show have said they believe can certainly help.
[3:36:02.200 --> 3:36:19.200]  What can you do to keep you and your family safe from resistant new strains of deadly bacteria and viruses?

[3:36:52.200 --> 3:37:01.200]  And those sponsors, I believe in and have made this show possible today. Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Dan in Illinois. Dan, you're on the air. Thanks for holding. Welcome.
[3:37:01.200 --> 3:37:12.200]  Thank you, Mr. Jones. It's a privilege to talk to you, sir. Hey, I'm just wanted to throw this out there real quick. I'm a 30 year old business owner, successful business owner. I know that's going to drive the opponent.
[3:37:12.200 --> 3:37:23.200]  You're going to have that gun owner, conservative business owner. In fact, I forgot to get to it. Did you guys print that article? I forgot to print. My computer's all locked up.
[3:37:23.200 --> 3:37:34.200]  The one about it's up on info wars and prisonplanet.com. Sorry, interrupters. I want to get this out for you about how about how all protesters are listed in army documents as terrorists.
[3:37:34.200 --> 3:37:51.200]  It's terrorism. Freedom is terror. But go ahead. Guilty of charge. Hey, two points I wanted to make real quick. If you reported on it already, then I apologize in advance, but MSN.com is reporting that due to the civil unrest in Iran, five out of the six internet ports have been shut down by the Iranian government.
[3:37:51.200 --> 3:38:04.200]  And if people think that that can't happen here, all they do is flip a switch. Yeah, no, they're very childlike. You know, I make these videos warning people how they're going to shut the web down with the head of cybersecurity resigning and confirming what we already said years ago.
[3:38:04.200 --> 3:38:13.200]  People go, it's impossible to shut the web down. It's meant to survive a nuke attack. That's if the US government wants to keep it on, but they own it and run it.
[3:38:13.200 --> 3:38:22.200]  And now they're even going in under law and grabbing the private hubs and making them put in federal kill switches where everything goes through it on record.
[3:38:22.200 --> 3:38:24.200]  And yes, you're absolutely right.
[3:38:24.200 --> 3:38:44.200]  Hey, point number two real quick. I checked out one of your videos, excuse me, from about 10 years ago. And with all the problems that the states are supposedly having with in the government with budget deficit, do you think it's not time that we open up Freedom of Information Act on the comprehensive annual financial reports for all states and government to find out where the real money is?
[3:38:44.200 --> 3:38:55.200]  I mean, the four years, it's open. They admit to have a double set of books and that they shipped all the money off short of the bankers. They don't even hide it. They go, look, we stole your money. You don't like it. I'll send by paramilitary troops to kill you.
[3:38:55.200 --> 3:38:59.200]  And we have a lot of teams ready to eat your guts and ask for seconds.
[3:38:59.200 --> 3:39:10.200]  Illinois is reporting that they need a $9 billion budget, you know, shortfall that they have to make cuts on. But back in old three, they had a $17 billion surplus.
[3:39:10.200 --> 3:39:21.200]  Well, you know, it's Illinois that started it. The mafia back in the 20s started having a double set of books and using the mayors. It's Chicago 1313 and Al Capone.
[3:39:21.200 --> 3:39:29.200]  And then mafia is like, God, we run the government now. So they set a double set of books and they would not fill the potholes and say we need more taxes and then get them.
[3:39:29.200 --> 3:39:41.200]  And it's this. And so the bankers, the Federal Reserve said, we'll just run a Chicago mafia scam. And since then, it's been adopted worldwide. And yeah, no, it's that's that's it's unbelievable. I appreciate your call.
[3:39:41.200 --> 3:39:43.200]  Yeah, this is absolute scum. We're talking about here.
[3:39:43.200 --> 3:39:47.200]  Craig in New Jersey. Go ahead, Craig.
[3:39:47.200 --> 3:39:49.200]  What's up, Alex?
[3:39:49.200 --> 3:40:00.200]  One thing I'm just calling in to promote the all new we are change New Jersey.org website. Oh, very evil. Americans getting together and demonstrating and asking government questions.
[3:40:00.200 --> 3:40:03.200]  I agree with Glenn Beck. That's dangerous.
[3:40:03.200 --> 3:40:12.200]  So tell me more about the video posted on the site and if I can, I'll just give out my email real quick. It's Craig at we are change New Jersey.org.
[3:40:12.200 --> 3:40:15.200]  Good. And tell me more about what you guys are doing.
[3:40:15.200 --> 3:40:23.200]  Basically right now that the site's brand new. It's only up for about eight days now. We're just trying to organize and get together everybody in New Jersey.
[3:40:23.200 --> 3:40:30.200]  And no matter what group you belong to and the Fed campaign for liberty, we are change Jersey City 911 truth.
[3:40:30.200 --> 3:40:44.200]  We all have to come together at this critical point in American history right now and just try to stop out the path to socialism that we're seeing right now.
[3:40:44.200 --> 3:40:48.200]  I appreciate your call. Good to hear from you, Craig.
[3:40:48.200 --> 3:40:55.200]  Matthew in Pennsylvania, you're on the air. If you protest in any way, the army says you're a terrorist. Go ahead, terrorist.
[3:40:55.200 --> 3:40:59.200]  That's right. I'm growing my own tomatoes over here.
[3:40:59.200 --> 3:41:01.200]  Without a license?
[3:41:01.200 --> 3:41:02.200]  That's right.
[3:41:02.200 --> 3:41:06.200]  SWAT teams are now rating people nationwide for that. I'm not kidding. Go ahead.
[3:41:06.200 --> 3:41:10.200]  That's right. Hey, have you seen Naomi Wolf's latest installment?
[3:41:10.200 --> 3:41:15.200]  I saw a video she made about the police state a few months ago. Is there another one?
[3:41:15.200 --> 3:41:19.200]  Yeah, well, there's a two DVD at the end of America.
[3:41:19.200 --> 3:41:24.200]  Yeah, we tried to have her on twice, but her phone never works when she's on. Very strange.
[3:41:24.200 --> 3:41:39.200]  Yeah, I found one part of it very, very disgusting where they had a release up in the Hamptons and they're all drinking wine and kind of saying that they're part of the resistance.
[3:41:39.200 --> 3:41:47.200]  I just like to say that here at home, we're growing tomatoes and we're going to throw them at the stage.
[3:41:47.200 --> 3:41:48.200]  Oh, my God.
[3:41:48.200 --> 3:41:50.200]  Thank you. Good night.
[3:41:50.200 --> 3:41:57.200]  All right, I appreciate your call. They're very, very frightening. I think he's eating those tomatoes. They made him go crazy. It's al-Qaeda.
[3:41:57.200 --> 3:42:02.200]  Oh, my God, al-Qaeda. All right, who's up next here?
[3:42:02.200 --> 3:42:06.200]  Another Gregory from California. Go ahead, Gregory.
[3:42:06.200 --> 3:42:08.200]  How are you doing, brother?
[3:42:08.200 --> 3:42:14.200]  You know how to talk. That's another sign of al-Qaeda. You need more fluoride pills. Go ahead, sir.
[3:42:14.200 --> 3:42:23.200]  No, in the future, being able to talk is going to be seen as, I'm not kidding, because they're going to reduce the language down to nothing, that very shocking and arrestable offense.
[3:42:23.200 --> 3:42:25.200]  Go ahead and commit crimes. Go ahead and talk.
[3:42:25.200 --> 3:42:37.200]  Well, I was going to ask you the last time I took a break from your show, I got taken off into Orange County Jail a couple months after old Christopher Jones had to go through there.
[3:42:37.200 --> 3:42:42.200]  Yes, Chris Jones, who shot the video inside Bohemian Grove, taking away to prison.
[3:42:42.200 --> 3:42:50.200]  Well, I remember, I think that was around October, I tried getting a hold of a friend of mine that trains.
[3:42:50.200 --> 3:42:56.200]  He knows the guy that trains the men over in the Music Honor Ranch, I believe, but I couldn't get a hold of him.
[3:42:56.200 --> 3:43:00.200]  But just to figure out, I was hoping to ask, how'd that go?
[3:43:00.200 --> 3:43:05.200]  All right, I'm a little confused, but I appreciate your call, Gregory. Good to hear from you.
[3:43:05.200 --> 3:43:11.200]  I remember, you want to know the whole Chris Jones story, people asked me about that, unlike an email, and I've forgotten to comment on it.
[3:43:11.200 --> 3:43:18.200]  Chris Jones, okay, I was not going to Bohemian Grove with my cancer in 2000, shot that video.
[3:43:18.200 --> 3:43:20.200]  And people for years said it wasn't real.
[3:43:20.200 --> 3:43:24.200]  Now the Bohemian Grove admits I snuck in and we had out in the woods and didn't try to be social.
[3:43:24.200 --> 3:43:29.200]  That's why we didn't get caught like the Vanity Fair and People Magazine and CBS reporters.
[3:43:29.200 --> 3:43:35.200]  It's more than 15 reporters, you count them up that have been arrested and charged with trespassing.
[3:43:35.200 --> 3:43:38.200]  I snuck in, hit out, and got out of there.
[3:43:38.200 --> 3:43:41.200]  A few times I was out in public, I got questioned and almost got caught.
[3:43:41.200 --> 3:43:53.200]  But the issue is, then in 2004, Officer Jack McClam called up and he said,
[3:43:53.200 --> 3:43:59.200]  my webmaster lives in California and he's applied for a job there.
[3:43:59.200 --> 3:44:01.200]  Do you want him to shoot?
[3:44:01.200 --> 3:44:03.200]  He's going to shoot video. Do you want it?
[3:44:03.200 --> 3:44:07.200]  And I said, no, I'm not going to have anything to do with anybody else going in there.
[3:44:07.200 --> 3:44:10.200]  They're going to end up charging him. He's going to go to jail.
[3:44:10.200 --> 3:44:15.200]  I'm not going to put anybody into a position to go to jail.
[3:44:15.200 --> 3:44:18.200]  And I talked to Chris Jones and I said, if you want to do it, go ahead and do it.
[3:44:18.200 --> 3:44:20.200]  But I said, this isn't a joke.
[3:44:20.200 --> 3:44:26.200]  There's a lot of threats over this. And I said, I'm a public figure is why they haven't come after me that bad.
[3:44:26.200 --> 3:44:28.200]  But bad stuff's happened to other people.
[3:44:28.200 --> 3:44:31.200]  And the Bohemian Grove is connected to the polycloth murder.
[3:44:31.200 --> 3:44:33.200]  They found it right outside there.
[3:44:33.200 --> 3:44:35.200]  And I said, these are very serious people.
[3:44:35.200 --> 3:44:37.200]  And I said, I risk my life.
[3:44:37.200 --> 3:44:39.200]  And I advise Chris Jones not to do it.
[3:44:39.200 --> 3:44:45.200]  Well, about two weeks after the Bohemian Grove that year, in comes the mail, memory stick,
[3:44:45.200 --> 3:44:50.200]  the little Sony cameras that are still cameras and also shoot video of him getting footage.
[3:44:50.200 --> 3:44:54.200]  And I told him not to tell people.
[3:44:54.200 --> 3:44:57.200]  We gave him and then finally he went public who he was.
[3:44:57.200 --> 3:45:00.200]  And they went and swat team to him and arrest him and set him up.
[3:45:00.200 --> 3:45:07.200]  And they said that because he showed neighbors my film Dark Secrets inside Bohemian Grove that's aired on Trio Network,
[3:45:07.200 --> 3:45:12.200]  the footage that that was a real murder of a child and that he did it.
[3:45:12.200 --> 3:45:14.200]  This is this is in the newspaper.
[3:45:14.200 --> 3:45:26.200]  That's how and they got a jury that was so dumb down like the Salem witch trials that they believe Chris Jones had been part of a satanic ritual and had shown people.
[3:45:26.200 --> 3:45:28.200]  That's how America operates now.
[3:45:28.200 --> 3:45:35.200]  So a lot of people talk about getting jobs or infiltrating it.
[3:45:35.200 --> 3:45:38.200]  It isn't a game.
[3:45:38.200 --> 3:45:41.200]  It isn't a game.
[3:45:41.200 --> 3:45:46.200]  We have the FBI here. I have all sorts of sorts of crap happened to me that I don't even want to get into.
[3:45:46.200 --> 3:45:49.200]  This is not a game, folks. This is not a joke.
[3:45:49.200 --> 3:45:54.200]  This is not a and I kept telling Chris, I said, Chris, you got to stop telling people who you really are.
[3:45:54.200 --> 3:46:00.200]  I said, you know.
[3:46:00.200 --> 3:46:01.200]  And then he went further.
[3:46:01.200 --> 3:46:03.200]  He tried to get a job there again.
[3:46:03.200 --> 3:46:08.200]  And that's when they came and arrested him for Bohemian Grove saying he was killing children.
[3:46:08.200 --> 3:46:11.200]  And he's in prison last time I checked.
[3:46:11.200 --> 3:46:14.200]  I mean, this is how America operates, folks.
[3:46:14.200 --> 3:46:20.200]  I mean, I could take you to a town 10 miles from me where the cops will pull you over, punch you right in the face and take your wallet and laugh at you.
[3:46:20.200 --> 3:46:22.200]  And it's on seeing in and nobody's going to stop them.
[3:46:22.200 --> 3:46:25.200]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[3:46:25.200 --> 3:46:31.200]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kyle in California. Kyle, you're on the air.
[3:46:31.200 --> 3:46:33.200]  Hey, Mr. John, how you doing?
[3:46:33.200 --> 3:46:34.200]  Good.
[3:46:34.200 --> 3:46:39.200]  Great segue to actually bring me in the whole Bohemian Grove thing.
[3:46:39.200 --> 3:46:41.200]  What year did you do the Waco?
[3:46:41.200 --> 3:46:47.200]  What year did you did you do that whole film thing for the Waco incident?
[3:46:47.200 --> 3:46:51.200]  Well, we built it all started like this.
[3:46:51.200 --> 3:46:59.200]  We were out there with interviewing Branch Davidians to make a documentary and they were saying, oh, gee, I wish we had a bigger building.
[3:46:59.200 --> 3:47:12.200]  Because all they had was a tiny shack that held like 10 people, a bigger building, so at least the 20 or so survivors could get into it and had the once a year memorial that was less than 20 survivors.
[3:47:12.200 --> 3:47:14.200]  And Mike Hansen was with me.
[3:47:14.200 --> 3:47:15.200]  He goes, oh, yeah, we'll do it.
[3:47:15.200 --> 3:47:17.200]  And I said, Mike, I don't have the money for that.
[3:47:17.200 --> 3:47:18.200]  And he goes, oh, just ask your listeners.
[3:47:18.200 --> 3:47:21.200]  It'll be a small little shack costs a few thousand dollars.
[3:47:21.200 --> 3:47:29.200]  And then George Pullian, since the cease and architect shows up and draws up this giant thing with 48 columns and holds 400 people.
[3:47:29.200 --> 3:47:31.200]  And so the feds can't burn it down.
[3:47:31.200 --> 3:47:33.200]  It'll be built out of Hardy board.
[3:47:33.200 --> 3:47:35.200]  And it's not fancy, but it's big.
[3:47:35.200 --> 3:47:40.200]  And so I just that that happened without even my control and just got built.
[3:47:40.200 --> 3:47:44.200]  So that's pretty well known for that, that, you know, stirring up the feathers.
[3:47:44.200 --> 3:47:47.200]  You have a lot of information on a lot of subjects and a lot of.
[3:47:47.200 --> 3:47:51.200]  You know, I was just filling that in because Wikipedia won't let me spell my name right.
[3:47:51.200 --> 3:47:54.200]  They won't let me get my and it says I built the Davidian church.
[3:47:54.200 --> 3:47:55.200]  Like I was with Koresh.
[3:47:55.200 --> 3:47:56.200]  I never met Koresh.
[3:47:56.200 --> 3:48:01.200]  I built a memorial church with a plaque for the officers that died as well.
[3:48:01.200 --> 3:48:06.200]  And the media says I am a Davidian who built the thing with Koresh.
[3:48:06.200 --> 3:48:07.200]  And it's all lies.
[3:48:07.200 --> 3:48:13.200]  USA Today is on info wars.com that says we're building a memorial church for those that died.
[3:48:13.200 --> 3:48:17.200]  But I'm just explaining that that's how the media twist things.
[3:48:17.200 --> 3:48:22.200]  People now think I'm a Davidian that, that was there in the siege and firing with the BATF.
[3:48:22.200 --> 3:48:25.200]  And I barely survived and I was with Al Qaeda.
[3:48:25.200 --> 3:48:27.200]  And, you know, it's just none of it's true.
[3:48:27.200 --> 3:48:31.200]  How many, how many years after did you sneak into Bohemian Grove after you did the Waco thing?
[3:48:31.200 --> 3:48:33.200]  A year, a year later.
[3:48:33.200 --> 3:48:38.200]  So you, you, how can, can you explain to me how someone like you can stir up so many feathers
[3:48:38.200 --> 3:48:42.200]  or ruffle up so many feathers with the elite or if you will, the people who.
[3:48:42.200 --> 3:48:45.200]  I explained how the forces with me.
[3:48:45.200 --> 3:48:47.200]  I mean, I believe in God.
[3:48:47.200 --> 3:48:52.200]  I mean, how did, and I'm not comparing myself to David Crockett, but he read all his exploits.
[3:48:52.200 --> 3:48:54.200]  A hundred times the man I am.
[3:48:54.200 --> 3:49:01.200]  I mean, I mean, look, I, I'm in the media and I'm doing these things and I've paid a great price.
[3:49:01.200 --> 3:49:05.200]  Who controls the media, the national press, Reuters and who owns them, the rock child.
[3:49:05.200 --> 3:49:07.200]  And you interviewed David, the rock child.
[3:49:07.200 --> 3:49:09.200]  And I mean, it just, it's kind of.
[3:49:09.200 --> 3:49:10.200]  Oh, this is an attack call.
[3:49:10.200 --> 3:49:13.200]  Well, I mean, I mean, let me stop you and actually answer that question.
[3:49:13.200 --> 3:49:17.200]  Have you heard that Rothschild interview?
[3:49:17.200 --> 3:49:18.200]  Kind of.
[3:49:18.200 --> 3:49:19.200]  I listened to a little bit.
[3:49:19.200 --> 3:49:22.200]  I'm really not into the, to the whole eco green thing and what.
[3:49:22.200 --> 3:49:25.200]  Oh, you better be because they're using that takeover.
[3:49:25.200 --> 3:49:31.200]  He put out a book of children's book about how the polar bears can't swim and all this.
[3:49:31.200 --> 3:49:36.200]  So let me tell you how we get big guests for all the other shows that are lazy and then think we have magical powers.
[3:49:36.200 --> 3:49:41.200]  We pick up the phone and we call up and we say, we would like to interview Mr. Rothschild.
[3:49:41.200 --> 3:49:46.200]  And she's like, well, he's doing 14 interviews today and 20 tomorrow, but to promote his book.
[3:49:46.200 --> 3:49:52.200]  But we can give you 10 minutes on this day and then you get him on and then you keep him on.
[3:49:52.200 --> 3:49:54.200]  You get an argument with him.
[3:49:54.200 --> 3:49:58.200]  Like people thought that was stage that I was at the Republican national convention and saw David Gergen.
[3:49:58.200 --> 3:50:04.200]  Who do you think sit that Sean Hannity and David Gergen and I walk up and talk to David Gergen.
[3:50:04.200 --> 3:50:09.200]  No, this is real. If you'd get up off your butt and go out and live.
[3:50:09.200 --> 3:50:11.200]  I mean, you know, I'm the guy that predicted 9 11.
[3:50:11.200 --> 3:50:12.200]  Hold on, put him on hold.
[3:50:12.200 --> 3:50:13.200]  I'm going to hold him over.
[3:50:13.200 --> 3:50:14.200]  I'm the guy that predicted 9 11.
[3:50:14.200 --> 3:50:16.200]  I'm the guy that makes the first 9 11 film.
[3:50:16.200 --> 3:50:18.200]  I'm the guy that makes the big Obama film.
[3:50:18.200 --> 3:50:20.200]  I'm the guy because I work.
[3:50:20.200 --> 3:50:21.200]  I work.
[3:50:21.200 --> 3:50:22.200]  I work.
[3:50:22.200 --> 3:50:23.200]  I bust my butt.
[3:50:23.200 --> 3:50:25.200]  I fight the new world order.
[3:50:25.200 --> 3:50:27.200]  That's how I do it.
[3:50:27.200 --> 3:50:28.200]  Okay.
[3:50:28.200 --> 3:50:30.200]  I thought you were asking about the Davidians there.
[3:50:30.200 --> 3:50:31.200]  Okay.
[3:50:31.200 --> 3:50:33.200]  I snuck into Bohemian Grove.
[3:50:33.200 --> 3:50:34.200]  I'm the only one.
[3:50:34.200 --> 3:50:37.200]  The only mission in there to ever get out of there.
[3:50:37.200 --> 3:50:38.200]  Okay.
[3:50:38.200 --> 3:50:40.200]  And I did it because God is with me.
[3:50:40.200 --> 3:50:42.200]  And if he's with you, who can be against you?
[3:50:42.200 --> 3:50:45.200]  See, I believe in God.
[3:50:45.200 --> 3:50:50.200]  And so the fact that you would attack my credibility as if I'm not the real McCoy because I got
[3:50:50.200 --> 3:50:53.200]  radio producers and know how to pick a telephone up is baloney.
[3:50:53.200 --> 3:50:56.200]  But we'll come back to you with your BS.
[3:50:56.200 --> 3:50:59.200]  See, I'm not the bankers taking your life over.
[3:50:59.200 --> 3:51:00.200]  I'm the guy waking people up.
[3:51:00.200 --> 3:51:01.200]  I'm the good guy.
[3:51:01.200 --> 3:51:06.200]  With food prices soaring to all time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value,
[3:51:06.200 --> 3:51:10.200]  what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make
[3:51:10.200 --> 3:51:12.200]  it to your dinner table?
[3:51:12.200 --> 3:51:13.200]  Garden in a can.

[3:52:01.200 --> 3:52:07.200]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:52:07.200 --> 3:52:13.200]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[3:52:13.200 --> 3:52:19.200]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[3:52:19.200 --> 3:52:21.200]  Well Obama's already fudging.
[3:52:21.200 --> 3:52:24.200]  Yeah, fudged since day one in this election.
[3:52:24.200 --> 3:52:29.200]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[3:52:29.200 --> 3:52:35.200]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[3:52:37.200 --> 3:52:40.200]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[3:52:40.200 --> 3:52:47.200]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[3:52:55.200 --> 3:52:59.200]  The Obama deception. The people strike back.
[3:52:59.200 --> 3:53:04.200]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[3:53:04.200 --> 3:53:07.200]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[3:53:07.200 --> 3:53:12.200]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone
[3:53:12.200 --> 3:53:16.200]  and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[3:53:16.200 --> 3:53:22.200]  You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business.
[3:53:22.200 --> 3:53:25.200]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[3:53:25.200 --> 3:53:32.200]  So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years and he is passionate about turning other people on to the joys
[3:53:32.200 --> 3:53:35.200]  and benefits of working for themselves and not for others.
[3:53:35.200 --> 3:53:41.200]  MZ wants to tell you about a low-cost home business opportunity involving the marketing of healthful dark chocolate
[3:53:41.200 --> 3:53:46.200]  that can help people lose weight and set you up with an impressive compounding monthly income.
[3:53:46.200 --> 3:53:50.200]  Visit chocolate.ownmyself.com and check out the opportunity.
[3:53:50.200 --> 3:53:53.200]  That's chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[3:53:53.200 --> 3:53:57.200]  It takes very little money and if you're interested, MZ wants to talk to you.
[3:53:57.200 --> 3:54:00.200]  Remember chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[3:54:00.200 --> 3:54:16.200]  All right, final segment and I want to hit this final news DOD training manual describes protest as low-level terrorism.
[3:54:16.200 --> 3:54:21.200]  Yes, Kyle in California, I get calls and emails all the time saying,
[3:54:21.200 --> 3:54:26.200]  I didn't really sneak into Bohemian Grove or I'm new or order this, I'm new or order that.
[3:54:26.200 --> 3:54:32.200]  I am a standalone, self-made alternative media person who has great supporters that support me.
[3:54:32.200 --> 3:54:39.200]  The whole new loaders coming down on us, I'm fighting everything the bankers are doing and you're,
[3:54:39.200 --> 3:54:42.200]  I guess what you're saying is it's all fake?
[3:54:42.200 --> 3:54:44.200]  No, I'm not saying it's all fake.
[3:54:44.200 --> 3:54:49.200]  I would like to explain to you what's become apparent to me and I'm, let me explain my position.
[3:54:49.200 --> 3:54:53.200]  I'm a regular, I was born in 1984, I'm 25, I'm a regular person.
[3:54:53.200 --> 3:54:57.200]  I live in a small town in northern California.
[3:54:57.200 --> 3:54:59.200]  Okay, great, but I'm Alex.
[3:54:59.200 --> 3:55:01.200]  I mean, I'm just me, you're Kyle, I'm Alex.
[3:55:01.200 --> 3:55:03.200]  I mean, I'm here living my life too.
[3:55:03.200 --> 3:55:05.200]  Listen, stop, stop.
[3:55:05.200 --> 3:55:11.200]  The establishment wants to tear me down and attacks me with all this COINTELPRO to fool nice people like you
[3:55:11.200 --> 3:55:14.200]  so you won't believe you could be a leader and affect change as well.
[3:55:14.200 --> 3:55:20.200]  You could be just as successful as I've been if you'll just keep your head screwed on straight and take action
[3:55:20.200 --> 3:55:23.200]  without a spending all day.
[3:55:23.200 --> 3:55:25.200]  Well, then what is the point?
[3:55:25.200 --> 3:55:26.200]  What is the point?
[3:55:26.200 --> 3:55:27.200]  What are you trying to say?
[3:55:27.200 --> 3:55:28.200]  Boil it down.
[3:55:28.200 --> 3:55:29.200]  Okay, you're in California.
[3:55:29.200 --> 3:55:30.200]  Okay, great.
[3:55:30.200 --> 3:55:31.200]  Go ahead.
[3:55:31.200 --> 3:55:32.200]  Cutting me off.
[3:55:32.200 --> 3:55:33.200]  Listen.
[3:55:33.200 --> 3:55:34.200]  No, I'm not cutting you off.
[3:55:34.200 --> 3:55:35.200]  Hold on a minute.
[3:55:35.200 --> 3:55:36.200]  Make your point, man.
[3:55:36.200 --> 3:55:38.200]  I mean, what are you trying to say here to me?
[3:55:38.200 --> 3:55:43.200]  How can someone like you keep stern of feathers and actually be on the air still when people like
[3:55:43.200 --> 3:55:47.200]  Phil Schneider or even John F. Kennedy who, who told us about the society's got capital.
[3:55:47.200 --> 3:55:49.200]  Are you more important than these people?
[3:55:49.200 --> 3:55:53.200]  Like in 1995, Phil Schneider was talking about the new world order and then he got cap nine
[3:55:53.200 --> 3:55:54.200]  or strangled.
[3:55:54.200 --> 3:55:56.200]  So you are saying I'm bad.
[3:55:56.200 --> 3:55:57.200]  You are.
[3:55:57.200 --> 3:55:58.200]  Oh, no, no, no.
[3:55:58.200 --> 3:56:00.200]  I do believe that these people are allowing you to do this.
[3:56:00.200 --> 3:56:04.200]  Even if you don't know that they're allowing you to do this and you're ignorant of it.
[3:56:04.200 --> 3:56:05.200]  I know.
[3:56:05.200 --> 3:56:06.200]  Let me stop here right there.
[3:56:06.200 --> 3:56:07.200]  Let me, I gotta let you go.
[3:56:07.200 --> 3:56:08.200]  Okay.
[3:56:08.200 --> 3:56:12.200]  Look, what are you going to do about the new world order instead of killing the messenger
[3:56:12.200 --> 3:56:16.200]  and always doing the mentally ill excuse of, well, they're letting you do it.
[3:56:16.200 --> 3:56:18.200]  So I'm not going to fight the new world order.
[3:56:18.200 --> 3:56:19.200]  What does that mean?
[3:56:19.200 --> 3:56:20.200]  Absolutely.
[3:56:20.200 --> 3:56:21.200]  They tried to intimidate me.
[3:56:21.200 --> 3:56:22.200]  They tried to buy me off.
[3:56:22.200 --> 3:56:24.200]  They come up and punch me in the nose.
[3:56:24.200 --> 3:56:26.200]  They've had the IRS come after me.
[3:56:26.200 --> 3:56:29.200]  They've done everything you can imagine.
[3:56:29.200 --> 3:56:36.200]  And then some, they tried to call up mess with my wife and I've stayed on mission.
[3:56:36.200 --> 3:56:37.200]  Okay.
[3:56:37.200 --> 3:56:40.200]  And they killed Kennedy years after he fought him.
[3:56:40.200 --> 3:56:43.200]  They killed Gandhi decades after he fought him.
[3:56:43.200 --> 3:56:46.200]  I'm not Martin Luther King with three million people in front of me about to change the
[3:56:46.200 --> 3:56:47.200]  whole world.
[3:56:47.200 --> 3:56:49.200]  I think you get a little too big of an image of how big I am.
[3:56:49.200 --> 3:56:54.200]  I am getting bigger and it's dangerous and I don't frankly enjoy it, but it's a catch
[3:56:54.200 --> 3:56:55.200]  22.
[3:56:55.200 --> 3:56:57.200]  I got to get even bigger to survive.
[3:56:57.200 --> 3:56:59.200]  But then that also is a danger.
[3:56:59.200 --> 3:57:01.200]  So regardless, my fruits are good.
[3:57:01.200 --> 3:57:06.200]  I've done well and it isn't just that I don't like being lied about because I know I'm
[3:57:06.200 --> 3:57:07.200]  legitimate.
[3:57:07.200 --> 3:57:08.200]  I know I'm for real.
[3:57:08.200 --> 3:57:13.400]  It also destroys the image of what I am an image for others, a model to build and fight
[3:57:13.400 --> 3:57:14.400]  tyranny.
[3:57:14.400 --> 3:57:18.000]  The globalists are not all powerful.
[3:57:18.000 --> 3:57:21.040]  A lot of their own people now are waking up and wanting to join us.
[3:57:21.040 --> 3:57:22.200]  We could win.
[3:57:22.200 --> 3:57:26.600]  But as we win, people aren't going to believe we can win because the church has been bought
[3:57:26.600 --> 3:57:32.120]  off and paid off and told all these lies and that, you know, it's the end of the world.
[3:57:32.120 --> 3:57:33.120]  We can't fight evil.
[3:57:33.120 --> 3:57:35.240]  Well, let's say it's the end of the world.
[3:57:35.240 --> 3:57:36.240]  We have a duty to fight evil.
[3:57:36.240 --> 3:57:37.240]  I meant to get to this.
[3:57:37.240 --> 3:57:38.240]  Folks, this is important.
[3:57:38.240 --> 3:57:41.000]  This is up on info wars.com and present plan.com.
[3:57:41.000 --> 3:57:44.320]  DoD training manual describes protests as low level terrorism.
[3:57:44.320 --> 3:57:50.320]  The army official training manual given to all military in the army teaches that any
[3:57:50.320 --> 3:57:55.160]  type of protest is terrorism and that all peace protesting supports Al Qaeda.
[3:57:55.160 --> 3:57:57.680]  Same thing we've heard before, but now the army's taught this.
[3:57:57.680 --> 3:58:01.000]  This is mainstream news reporting this.
[3:58:01.000 --> 3:58:02.840]  This is just horrible.
[3:58:02.840 --> 3:58:06.560]  And we've got to focus on what that's happening there and get back our bill of rights and
[3:58:06.560 --> 3:58:11.840]  constitution and say no to that instead of obsessing all day on how is Alex Jones still
[3:58:11.840 --> 3:58:12.840]  alive?
[3:58:12.840 --> 3:58:15.560]  I'm alive because if they kill me, it'll make me a hero.
[3:58:15.560 --> 3:58:19.800]  Now at a point where I'm leading movements so big it may challenge him like a Ron Paul,
[3:58:19.800 --> 3:58:20.800]  they may do something to me.
[3:58:20.800 --> 3:58:24.960]  Ron Paul said he's on in danger, but he's marching forward.
[3:58:24.960 --> 3:58:29.200]  We need to support him and realize those that are attacking him are operatives or mentally
[3:58:29.200 --> 3:58:30.200]  ill.
[3:58:30.200 --> 3:58:31.200]  This is real, folks.
[3:58:31.200 --> 3:58:32.200]  I am real.
[3:58:32.200 --> 3:58:37.560]  Retransmission starts now info wars.com hit the free podcast great job crew back tomorrow
[3:58:37.560 --> 3:58:43.560]  live 11 to three transmission continues on the other side.

[3:58:51.640 --> 3:58:52.640]  Hello friends.
[3:58:52.640 --> 3:58:53.640]  This is Alex Jones.
[3:58:53.640 --> 3:58:57.080]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self sufficient and today that's more
[3:58:57.080 --> 3:58:58.080]  important than ever.
[3:58:58.080 --> 3:59:01.080]  We need to be independent and food and water is the key.
[3:59:01.080 --> 3:59:03.800]  You'll never have to scan in a bread line or you have your own bread.
[3:59:03.800 --> 3:59:07.880]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in
[3:59:07.880 --> 3:59:08.880]  any emergency.
[3:59:08.880 --> 3:59:12.640]  If you simply prepare, no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation
[3:59:12.640 --> 3:59:13.640]  but you.
[3:59:13.640 --> 3:59:17.800]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storeable food that's safe from E. coli,
[3:59:17.800 --> 3:59:22.080]  salmonella genetic alteration or Chinese imports and they do it at almost half the cost of
[3:59:22.080 --> 3:59:23.680]  last year's grocery prices.
