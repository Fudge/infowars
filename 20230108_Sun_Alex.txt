[00:00.000 --> 00:13.680]  English historian Peter Heather controversially argued that Rome was ultimately overcome by
[00:13.680 --> 00:15.200]  illegal immigration.
[00:15.200 --> 00:21.240]  Heather accepted the academic analysis that the Huns on the Pontic Steppe in the late 4th
[00:21.240 --> 00:25.280]  century set these migrations in motion.
[00:25.280 --> 00:31.600]  However, according to Heather, the assumption that the barbarians were then peacefully absorbed
[00:31.600 --> 00:36.440]  into Rome smells more of wishful thinking than likely reality.
[00:36.440 --> 00:41.000]  Rome had always been an inclusive society that welcomed immigrants.
[00:41.000 --> 00:46.320]  Immigrants were given employment in the Roman army, but were welcomed only if they assimilated.
[00:46.320 --> 00:48.520]  Of course, Rome still fell.
[00:48.520 --> 00:55.080]  What makes anyone think that the United States and Europe can absorb violent, non- assimilating
[00:55.080 --> 01:01.440]  immigrants from all over the world, with the result not ultimately collapsing 21st century
[01:01.440 --> 01:02.440]  civilization.
[01:02.440 --> 01:08.320]  The drug crisis in the United States continues to escalate.
[01:08.320 --> 01:12.200]  This year, more than 100,000 Americans died due to a drug overdose.
[01:12.200 --> 01:15.280]  It is now one of the top 10 reasons for deaths in America.
[01:15.280 --> 01:20.600]  Breitbart reported that Texas Attorney General Kent Paxton filed a lawsuit against the Biden
[01:20.600 --> 01:27.040]  administration over its rule change, allowing immigrants into the country who will be dependent
[01:27.040 --> 01:28.800]  on welfare.
[01:28.800 --> 01:35.240]  Federal immigration law has required a public charge determination for immigrants, which
[01:35.240 --> 01:40.840]  bars them from staying in the country if they are likely to use welfare programs like food
[01:40.840 --> 01:43.560]  stamps, Medicaid, or government housing.
[01:43.560 --> 01:49.920]  Studies show taxpayers are being billed about $1,600 a year per immigrant, and that immigrants
[01:49.920 --> 01:55.280]  use 33 percent more cash welfare than American citizens.
[01:55.280 --> 02:03.160]  Similarly, about 63 percent of non-citizen households use at least one form of public
[02:03.160 --> 02:11.240]  welfare, while only about 35 percent of native-born American households are on welfare.
[02:11.240 --> 02:15.200]  The architects of this collapse know full well what they are doing.
[02:15.200 --> 02:21.160]  We hear frequently that people are at the center of sustainable development, and we
[02:21.160 --> 02:25.360]  know that, by definition, people are at the center of populations.
[02:25.360 --> 02:30.560]  Well, from these two simple observations, it follows that an understanding of population
[02:30.560 --> 02:35.520]  patterns and trends will be essential for the successful implementation of the 2030
[02:35.520 --> 02:38.440]  agenda for sustainable development.
[02:38.440 --> 02:40.160]  Let me be clear.
[02:40.160 --> 02:45.200]  No 42 or not, the border is not open.
[02:45.200 --> 02:51.000]  The collapse is right in front of us, as Californians flee for Mexico under California
[02:51.000 --> 02:52.000]  Governor Newsom.
[02:52.000 --> 02:54.520]  Both of you are leaving California too.
[02:54.520 --> 02:59.560]  Some fear that mass departures by the state's billionaires and tech companies could reduce
[02:59.560 --> 03:02.400]  local and state tax revenues.
[03:02.400 --> 03:07.680]  Just one percent of California's top income earners are responsible for half of all income
[03:07.680 --> 03:09.200]  tax revenue.
[03:09.200 --> 03:14.240]  Those drops could have the potential to affect the government's services for years to come.
[03:14.240 --> 03:18.580]  And illegals kill Americans at a higher rate than Americans kill each other.
[03:18.580 --> 03:24.080]  How many American children are going to be burned alive before our elected leaders decide
[03:24.080 --> 03:25.280]  to take action?
[03:25.280 --> 03:26.520]  The Republicans don't care.
[03:26.520 --> 03:28.360]  They don't want to stand up to the donor class.
[03:28.360 --> 03:29.720]  The Democrats sure don't care.
[03:29.720 --> 03:30.880]  They want new voters.
[03:30.880 --> 03:31.880]  Big business?
[03:31.880 --> 03:33.280]  They want cheap labor.
[03:33.280 --> 03:38.920]  Meanwhile, ICE is confirming that Jose Rosales, who is accused of killing Harris County, Texas
[03:38.920 --> 03:44.640]  Corporal Charles Galloway, is in the country illegally when he murdered that officer.
[03:44.640 --> 03:45.920]  Tell us what happened to your brother.
[03:45.920 --> 03:50.560]  He was murdered in 2018 by an illegal criminal alien.
[03:50.560 --> 03:57.120]  She was rear-ended by Eswan Mejia, who was 19 years old, here illegally.
[03:57.120 --> 04:02.120]  Margarito Contaro-Rozales told authorities he fell asleep at the wheel and his van drifted
[04:02.120 --> 04:04.040]  into the oncoming lane.
[04:04.040 --> 04:05.600]  He was here illegally.
[04:05.600 --> 04:10.600]  It's not a day goes by in this country that there isn't at least one American citizen
[04:10.600 --> 04:16.640]  that dies at the hands of someone who's unlawfully present in the United States, whether it is
[04:16.640 --> 04:22.440]  an act of homicide, whether it's an act of willful manslaughter, whether it's at O.W.I.
[04:22.440 --> 04:24.520]  on the streets of America.
[04:24.520 --> 04:30.120]  Hardly anybody has gone through the last 10 years and doesn't at least see that show up
[04:30.120 --> 04:34.240]  in their local newspaper if it doesn't show up in their neighborhood.
[04:34.240 --> 04:40.480]  The cold reality, ignored by the media-industrial complex, lingers in the shadows of a crumbling
[04:40.480 --> 04:47.720]  America, vomiting the United Nations' replacement migration directive, fueled by globalist Trillionaire
[04:47.720 --> 04:53.720]  NGOs, kept in motion by runaway government corruption and rammed down the throats of
[04:53.720 --> 04:58.720]  the American taxpayer in order to usher in a new world order.
[04:58.720 --> 05:05.720]  Good news and some bad news on multiple fronts, the good news is, vitamin mineral fusion and
[05:05.720 --> 05:09.920]  DNA force plus are still 50% off.
[05:09.920 --> 05:14.760]  The bad news is they're very close to selling out and by Monday of next week, and I'm cutting
[05:14.760 --> 05:19.880]  this ad on January 5th, 2023, we're going to have to go back to full price, then about
[05:19.880 --> 05:22.080]  a week after that they'll be sold out.
[05:22.080 --> 05:25.680]  So that's good news, you can still get the products, it's bad news because they're about
[05:25.680 --> 05:30.000]  to be sold out because they're also some of our best selling products and we don't have
[05:30.000 --> 05:32.280]  them, we can't find the operation.
[05:32.280 --> 05:36.480]  So it is a real conundrum but that's just where we're at, we'll thank all the listeners
[05:36.480 --> 05:40.280]  for your ongoing support but if you want vitamin mineral fusion it's so incredible for your
[05:40.280 --> 05:43.760]  immune system and your whole body and DNA force plus that helps your telomeres last
[05:43.760 --> 05:48.120]  longer and cleans out your mitochondria and so much more, you can get them both exclusively
[05:48.120 --> 05:54.640]  top of the line supplements at infowarstore.com, still 50% off until this coming Monday, they're
[05:54.640 --> 05:58.320]  going to be sold out for months and months, thanks for all your support, now please visit
[05:58.320 --> 06:24.040]  infowarstore.com, in Sunday, January 8th, info wars, tomorrow's news, today, you are either
[06:24.040 --> 06:34.040]  with the republic or against it, resistance to titans is obedience to god, it's alex jones.
[06:34.040 --> 06:43.880]  Holding high above my head the eternal torch of liberty, the defense of life, the free
[06:43.880 --> 06:51.480]  will and the worship of the creator of the universe, well we have quite the transmission
[06:51.480 --> 06:58.480]  lined up for you this evening, I returned yesterday after a very important time spent
[06:58.480 --> 07:02.520]  with family and cogitating and really thinking about what's currently happening and the future
[07:02.520 --> 07:07.440]  that's about to unfold and how we can be part of that future, not just be bystanders, let
[07:07.440 --> 07:12.520]  the new world run over us and I am recharged and ready and back in studio, I won't just
[07:12.520 --> 07:18.560]  be hosting obviously this Sunday show but the weekday program 11am to 3pm central at the
[07:18.560 --> 07:26.640]  demonized, attacked, censored, lied about, fulcrumoflibertyinfowars.com, all right, let's
[07:26.640 --> 07:32.080]  dive straight into it, I'm going to get to all the other huge news coming up at the
[07:32.080 --> 07:37.960]  bottom of the hour but right now let's drill in to the puppet globalist Joe Biden following
[07:37.960 --> 07:44.320]  the UN replacement migration plan that the United Nations developed that Europe's been
[07:44.320 --> 07:49.880]  following and that we've been following for decades, he touched down about two hours ago
[07:49.880 --> 07:56.880]  in El Paso, he scheduled to take off the next 30 minutes, a touch and go and he's wandering
[07:56.880 --> 08:03.320]  around basically claiming that he's serving the supposed broken border and saying it's
[08:03.320 --> 08:11.400]  just fine, they have openly cleaned out all the illegal alien camps and UN camps and shipped
[08:11.400 --> 08:17.000]  the tent city set up on the other side of the US border in El Paso out so it's quite
[08:17.000 --> 08:31.040]  the Potemkin village or the matrix like deception that we are witnessing right now and here
[08:31.040 --> 08:35.920]  are some of the headlines, crisis what crisis, El Paso clears out migrant camps ahead of
[08:35.920 --> 08:41.360]  Biden's first trip to the border, Sunday is frustrated, agents say numbers always fall
[08:41.360 --> 08:47.360]  in January and he might as well have gone to Des Moines, meanwhile Biden's readying
[08:47.360 --> 08:55.120]  to announce his relaunch for his 2024 campaign, yes he's that arrogant, can't even hardly
[08:55.120 --> 09:00.480]  talk or walk now but they want a zombie just like Fetterman in office they can control,
[09:00.480 --> 09:04.520]  they'll probably steal the next election and install him again.
[09:04.520 --> 09:09.680]  Biden inspects busy port of entry along US Mexico border, that's what AP calls the collapsed
[09:09.680 --> 09:16.240]  border, a busy port of entry and here is the actual White House schedule where you can
[09:16.240 --> 09:25.240]  see where he landed here at two o'clock and is scheduled to take off any time now so basically
[09:25.240 --> 09:31.480]  a touch and go visit there while saying there wasn't a border crisis, now he blames it on
[09:31.480 --> 09:37.480]  the Republicans, Joe Biden arrives in El Paso, first border visit of his presidency, Texas
[09:37.480 --> 09:42.840]  governor says Biden team failed to communicate on border visit but here's what's really
[09:42.840 --> 09:52.120]  important, Biden came out when he was the vice president, this particular clips from
[09:52.120 --> 09:56.560]  nine years ago and then there's another clip from two and a half, three years ago when
[09:56.560 --> 10:01.280]  he was running for office saying basically the same thing, so here are these clips from
[10:01.280 --> 10:08.200]  the past back to back where he is announcing the globalist plan for replacement migration
[10:08.200 --> 10:13.360]  and to bring in giant third world populations, permanent underclasses the globalist can control,
[10:13.360 --> 10:14.920]  here it is.
[10:14.920 --> 10:19.200]  I would argue it's unlike any other large country in the world, so there's a second
[10:19.200 --> 10:28.520]  thing in that black box, an unrelenting stream of immigration, non stop, non stop, folks
[10:28.520 --> 10:36.120]  like me who are Caucasian of European descent for the first time in 2017 will be in an absolute
[10:36.120 --> 10:43.160]  minority in the United States of America, absolute minority, fewer than 50% of the people
[10:43.160 --> 10:51.880]  in America from then and on will be white European stock, that's not a bad thing, that's
[10:51.880 --> 10:59.000]  a source of our strength and so we have been, we haven't always gotten it right, I don't
[10:59.000 --> 11:00.000]  want to.
[11:00.000 --> 11:04.320]  What I would do as president is several more things because things have changed, I would
[11:04.320 --> 11:09.880]  in fact make sure that there is, we immediately surge to the border, all those people are
[11:09.880 --> 11:14.040]  seeking asylum, they deserve to be heard, that's who we are, we're a nation that says
[11:14.040 --> 11:18.000]  if you want to flee and you're fleeing oppression, you should come.
[11:18.000 --> 11:24.880]  And of course all the fake news fact check sites say that well, he said those things
[11:24.880 --> 11:29.960]  but he didn't mean those things even though he's completely dissolved the southern border,
[11:29.960 --> 11:34.120]  the northern border has been partially dissolved, unless you're a US citizen trying to get in,
[11:34.120 --> 11:36.360]  it's absolutely insane.
[11:36.360 --> 11:41.080]  So a lot of folks don't know what the term Potemkin village means but that basically
[11:41.080 --> 11:47.520]  goes back to examples of when the Tsars would visit a little village in poor areas of Russia,
[11:47.520 --> 11:55.120]  they would basically put up a whole fake happy pastoral view for them so they wouldn't know
[11:55.120 --> 11:57.440]  how bad the situation really was.
[11:57.440 --> 12:01.840]  A more modern example would be the Truman show where it's basically a staged event and
[12:01.840 --> 12:07.240]  boy do we have some examples of that coming up in here in just a moment but that's exactly
[12:07.240 --> 12:11.360]  what they did in El Paso, we showed you the videos, we've been down there this year, I
[12:11.360 --> 12:16.640]  mean thousands a day, up to 14,000 a day coming across, tens of thousands just sleeping on
[12:16.640 --> 12:21.920]  the streets of El Paso every day, being loaded on buses, trains, and planes and being flown
[12:21.920 --> 12:27.840]  all over the US by Democrats and signed up for welfare and signed up to vote, many of
[12:27.840 --> 12:32.560]  the blue cities they've legalized, illegal aliens voting, that's just a footnote but
[12:32.560 --> 12:39.440]  here it is, El Paso cleans up migrant camps before Joe Biden's border visit and under
[12:39.440 --> 12:44.720]  the term migrant you see the UN as world regulations saying they have a right to come here, they're
[12:44.720 --> 12:49.480]  called an alien in international law, they can't, so they tell you, oh be politically
[12:49.480 --> 12:53.120]  correct, don't call them illegal aliens, call them migrants and now you've allowed them
[12:53.120 --> 12:57.880]  all to opt into this and allow the human smuggling and allow the fentanyl, allow all the crime
[12:57.880 --> 13:05.000]  by being politically correct and using the terms you are told to use, Greg Abbott tweeted
[13:05.000 --> 13:08.560]  about it, the governor of Texas saying, El Paso rushes to remove illegal immigrants
[13:08.560 --> 13:14.240]  from migrant camps that are crowding downtown before Biden arrives, predictable, Biden doesn't
[13:14.240 --> 13:18.680]  want America to see the chaos that he has caused the border, this is just a photo op
[13:18.680 --> 13:22.800]  and a game of pretend, guess that's a good way of saying it, and the Mexican government
[13:22.800 --> 13:28.200]  did the same thing, Mexican officials sent special forces in quotes, I had a Biden border
[13:28.200 --> 13:34.840]  visit only posed for photos saying they weren't aware of the crisis, but what can governor
[13:34.840 --> 13:38.240]  Abbott do, he put the state guard down there and the national guard down there but they
[13:38.240 --> 13:43.840]  just pick up the illegals and then the feds get them and release them, so the governor
[13:43.840 --> 13:48.760]  has to admit that under the constitution he's close to powerless, it's a federal crisis,
[13:48.760 --> 13:54.680]  it is a federal jurisdiction to control the border, but the state has ways with the UN
[13:54.680 --> 13:59.820]  NGOs giving them debit cards and giving them money and loading them with unaccompanied
[13:59.820 --> 14:04.320]  children on cars, that's human trafficking, that's smuggling, that is a state prerogative
[14:04.320 --> 14:09.560]  as well and to have outside multinationals in command of federal officers outside of
[14:09.560 --> 14:16.360]  Congress is also a state issue to have unauthorized under state and federal law foreign operatives
[14:16.360 --> 14:20.600]  running operations and Abbott has opened a criminal investigation into that, but I want
[14:20.600 --> 14:27.040]  to see some indictments now because this is clear cut, meanwhile in Florida DeSantis calls
[14:27.040 --> 14:34.120]  on the national guard to help watch the influx, to help with the influx of illegal migrants,
[14:34.120 --> 14:38.640]  but all he can do is ship them somewhere else in the US, he cannot ship them out of the
[14:38.640 --> 14:45.000]  country because he does not control the national borders of the nation, it is not DeSantis's
[14:45.000 --> 14:49.760]  or Abbott's jurisdiction, so when Abbott puts some troops down there with machine guns they're
[14:49.760 --> 14:55.720]  just watching the people go back and forth, it's a joke, like putting a bandaid on a bullet
[14:55.720 --> 15:03.520]  wound, it's completely cosmetic, ceremonial, ridiculous, but at least DeSantis is talking
[15:03.520 --> 15:10.560]  about the fact that this is a federal crisis. My administration spent over 300 million this
[15:10.560 --> 15:14.320]  year in taxpayer money to fund illegal migrants' dental and healthcare, don't you wish you
[15:14.320 --> 15:20.800]  got all that free stuff? Shock video, let's play this out of Dublin, Ireland, busloads
[15:20.800 --> 15:27.840]  of military age male migrants invade Ireland, they arrive every day in Dublin by the hundreds
[15:27.840 --> 15:33.440]  from the Middle East and they're just dumped out with their Gucci bags and $500 pants and
[15:33.440 --> 15:41.720]  $1000 cell phones, just happening absolutely all over the world, all directed by the United
[15:41.720 --> 15:46.400]  Nations, all replacement migration, these people are then signed up with the deep state,
[15:46.400 --> 15:49.680]  with the Socialists, with the Communists and they're now a new permanent underclass that
[15:49.680 --> 15:53.800]  will burn down every city they live in when they're given the order by the deep state
[15:53.800 --> 15:57.040]  to do it, they're installing our kill switch, we'll be right back.
[15:57.040 --> 16:05.160]  Good news and some bad news on multiple fronts, the good news is vitamin mineral fusion and
[16:05.160 --> 16:12.000]  DNA force plus are still 50% off, the bad news is they're very close to selling out
[16:12.000 --> 16:17.120]  and by Monday of next week, and I'm cutting this ad on January 5th, 2023, we're going
[16:17.120 --> 16:21.560]  to have to go back to full price, then about a week after that they'll be sold out, so
[16:21.560 --> 16:25.320]  that's good news, you can still get the products, it's bad news because they're about to be
[16:25.320 --> 16:29.440]  sold out because they're also some of our best selling products, when we don't have
[16:29.440 --> 16:34.480]  them we can't find the operation, so it is a real conundrum but that's just where we're
[16:34.480 --> 16:38.440]  at, we'll thank all the listeners for your ongoing support, but if you want vitamin mineral
[16:38.440 --> 16:42.000]  fusion it's so incredible for your immune system, your whole body and DNA force plus
[16:42.000 --> 16:45.280]  that helps your telomeres last longer and cleans out your mitochondria and so much

[19:06.560 --> 19:12.320]  Infowars popularized those terms more than two decades ago and today whether it's Donald
[19:12.320 --> 19:19.040]  Trump or Governor DeSantis or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms that Infowars
[19:19.040 --> 19:23.400]  has popularized because we understand the enemy's operations and we know how to beat
[19:23.400 --> 19:27.800]  them, but we can't do it without funding and we make it easy to fund with great products

[19:50.240 --> 19:54.280]  to defeat the New World Order, we're going over the top, right now is the critical juncture,
[19:54.280 --> 20:02.000]  so please go to infowarstore.com and donate now.
[20:02.000 --> 20:29.560]  Getting a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:29.560 --> 20:55.720]  On
[20:55.720 --> 21:03.240]  May 4th, 1970, hundreds of students were protesting the Vietnam War at Kent State University.
[21:03.240 --> 21:08.280]  The National Guard tried to disperse the crowd, but were met with resistance.
[21:08.280 --> 21:12.240]  Things escalated and four students were shot and killed.
[21:12.240 --> 21:18.600]  This was rightfully memorialized as an overreach of power, but things have since changed in
[21:18.600 --> 21:20.360]  America.
[21:20.360 --> 21:27.480]  On January 6th, 2021, during perhaps the biggest peaceful protest of American history,
[21:27.480 --> 21:30.320]  the FBI instigated violence.
[21:30.320 --> 21:37.280]  Things escalated and four people died, including Ashley Babbitt, an unarmed Air Force veteran
[21:37.280 --> 21:40.440]  who was executed for climbing through a window.
[21:40.440 --> 21:47.740]  There were no rock anthems composed to memorialize her death, instead, her killer was celebrated
[21:47.740 --> 21:49.040]  on TV.
[21:49.040 --> 21:53.880]  The almighty, self-righteous liberal now celebrates tyranny.
[21:53.880 --> 22:00.080]  And after pretending that violent mobs burning down cities for an entire summer is peaceful,
[22:00.080 --> 22:06.040]  they pretend that the American patriots at the Capitol on January 6th are terrorists.
[22:06.040 --> 22:11.560]  And they pretend that the violent masked group Antifa does not exist.
[22:11.560 --> 22:18.760]  Antifa has been used regularly to silence, intimidate, and violently attack peaceful protesters.
[22:18.760 --> 22:21.880]  Including women, children, and the elderly.
[22:21.880 --> 22:27.440]  And because the police have proven to be nothing but tyrants, allowing all this to happen,
[22:27.440 --> 22:33.760]  a group of patriotic Americans known as the Proud Boys did the right thing and attempted
[22:33.760 --> 22:40.000]  to protect and defend their fellow man from a criminal government, including Army veteran
[22:40.000 --> 22:41.000]  Joe Biggs.
[22:41.000 --> 22:49.520]  People always ask why we come, my question is why don't more people come here, there's
[22:49.520 --> 22:52.680]  a lot of bad shit that's been going on, hundreds of days of violence, riots, assaulting police
[22:52.680 --> 22:59.600]  officers, killing people, executing people, we don't like seeing that, you know, I want
[22:59.600 --> 23:04.480]  everyone to learn how to get along, and like today as much as I do not like Antifa, I don't
[23:04.480 --> 23:08.680]  want any of those guys to get hurt, I want everyone to be able to go home, I disagree
[23:08.680 --> 23:13.340]  with them, but we should be able to disagree and keep our hands on ourselves.
[23:13.340 --> 23:18.200]  Because the police have done nothing, while innocent lives have been taken by government
[23:18.200 --> 23:25.600]  proxy groups, Antifa and Black Lives Matter, the Proud Boys stood up to exercise our God
[23:25.600 --> 23:29.920]  given right under natural law, self-defense.
[23:29.920 --> 23:35.960]  And because the brainwashed masses have fallen into complete submission to the corrupt system,
[23:35.960 --> 23:41.960]  a new precedent is now being set that will forever change this country, strip us of our
[23:41.960 --> 23:45.520]  First Amendment, and further enslave us all.
[23:45.520 --> 23:51.440]  Joe Biggs, along with four other members of the Proud Boys, are now being tried for sedition
[23:51.440 --> 23:54.480]  and face up to 20 years in prison.
[23:54.480 --> 24:00.360]  Court reporter Alicia Powell was there to witness the lead prosecutor accusing the defense of
[24:00.360 --> 24:06.520]  being racist, and nearly every potential jury member has rallied for Black Lives Matter
[24:06.520 --> 24:08.560]  and supports Antifa.
[24:08.560 --> 24:13.880]  A former CIA operative has also been qualified for the jury.
[24:13.880 --> 24:19.380]  These political prisoners have been rotting in an American gulag for a year, some are
[24:19.380 --> 24:26.640]  being starved and drugged, and our so-called leadership does absolutely nothing.
[24:26.640 --> 24:29.080]  The trial is set for next week.
[24:29.080 --> 24:35.080]  The current state of justice in America is a complete abomination, a system comprised
[24:35.080 --> 24:37.400]  of criminals and whores.
[24:37.400 --> 24:42.000]  May God bless America because we need a miracle.
[24:42.000 --> 24:49.640]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[24:49.640 --> 24:54.400]  That's just one of the latest reports that just went live today at Band.video.
[24:54.400 --> 24:55.400]  So incredibly important.
[24:55.400 --> 24:59.520]  I hope you'll go to Band.video and share it because you are the power of resistance out
[24:59.520 --> 25:00.520]  there.
[25:00.520 --> 25:03.760]  You are everything that stands between us and the New World Order.
[25:03.760 --> 25:04.760]  All right.
[25:04.760 --> 25:09.760]  In the last segment I got into Biden and his touch-and-go visit for just a few hours in
[25:09.760 --> 25:13.880]  Air Force One before he flies on to Mexico, trying to get them to sign on to the carbon
[25:13.880 --> 25:17.160]  taxes and the whole U.N. into the 2030 plan.
[25:17.160 --> 25:21.160]  But let me tell you what else I'm going to be covering tonight right now because this
[25:21.160 --> 25:24.200]  is all beyond critical.
[25:24.200 --> 25:28.160]  Every time I come on air I say this is the biggest COVID news yet because it all just
[25:28.160 --> 25:31.120]  comes out every day, even bigger revelations.
[25:31.120 --> 25:39.520]  Well, while I was out of town for five days, beyond anything we've ever seen came out on
[25:39.520 --> 25:45.920]  so many fronts from governments and insurance companies and national statistics and coroners
[25:45.920 --> 25:53.520]  and anecdotal examples of record heart attacks and myocarditis and that different think tanks
[25:53.520 --> 25:58.240]  and corporations and governments were also running, not just bots to surveil and put
[25:58.240 --> 26:05.200]  on propaganda, but with fake doctors on Facebook and Twitter and Instagram and YouTube, fake
[26:05.200 --> 26:11.680]  doctors saying, oh, the shots are safe, oh, nobody's gotten sick, everything's fine.
[26:11.680 --> 26:15.000]  So we have all of that in that stack coming up.
[26:15.000 --> 26:16.000]  It's so important.
[26:16.000 --> 26:17.000]  Next segment.
[26:17.000 --> 26:21.760]  Then obviously people want my take on the situation last week with Kevin McCarthy as
[26:21.760 --> 26:29.200]  the Speaker of the House, what happened there and am I mad at MTG or am I mad at Gates for
[26:29.200 --> 26:31.960]  going ahead and voting for McCarthy.
[26:31.960 --> 26:38.240]  I'm going to give you my take on that and really lay it all out in the last segment
[26:38.240 --> 26:39.240]  of this hour.
[26:39.240 --> 26:42.760]  Then we're going to look at their own January 6th.
[26:42.760 --> 26:47.560]  The Communist is now in control by clear election fraud, State Department help run the operation.
[26:47.560 --> 26:53.680]  We had millions of people protesting in the capital city of Brazil of the million, 10,000
[26:53.680 --> 26:58.520]  or so have gone and taken over the different government buildings, including the presidential
[26:58.520 --> 27:01.040]  palace.
[27:01.040 --> 27:04.920]  They literally look like they had about 15 police out front trying to stop them.
[27:04.920 --> 27:08.840]  So it looks like a deliberate stand down to demonize opposition.
[27:08.840 --> 27:15.280]  Just like January 6th, we're going to be laying all of that out as well.
[27:15.280 --> 27:20.120]  There's also been coordinated destruction as you know of food processing plants, several
[27:20.120 --> 27:24.240]  hundred via arson and explosions.
[27:24.240 --> 27:32.080]  Now we've got not dozens, but more than 50 that we know of electrical grid centers targeted
[27:32.080 --> 27:37.280]  with precision shooting to bring down power grids in different areas of the country.
[27:37.280 --> 27:42.480]  There's a big article on them in FullWars.com, media blackout over terror incident at Vegas
[27:42.480 --> 27:46.760]  power plant, just the latest of many in the last week.
[27:46.760 --> 27:48.960]  It's been going on for about three months.
[27:48.960 --> 27:56.120]  We've got all of that that we're going to be covering as well and huge governmental
[27:56.120 --> 28:03.960]  funding of the LGBTQP pedophile movement and the left pushing that not just here, but
[28:03.960 --> 28:12.440]  all over the world, including government spy agencies involved pushing the LGBTQP operation.
[28:12.440 --> 28:17.000]  And then, of course, we also have a lot of news on the economy and something I talked
[28:17.000 --> 28:21.880]  about a few years ago when Biden got in because I watched the policy changes and I watched
[28:21.880 --> 28:28.160]  the legislation they passed that Republicans, by the way, went along with many of them to
[28:28.160 --> 28:36.120]  hire 86,000 new IRS agents and specifically in the legislation, it said to target people
[28:36.120 --> 28:42.360]  depositing in a year's period $600 or more.
[28:42.360 --> 28:47.000]  Well now we've got the numbers after the policy went into effect the last year and a half
[28:47.000 --> 28:49.440]  and guess who the IRS was targeting?
[28:49.440 --> 28:51.320]  The poorest Americans.
[28:51.320 --> 28:52.320]  This is truly evil.
[28:52.320 --> 28:53.320]  We'll be right back.
[28:53.320 --> 29:12.840]  That means we've only got four days to act if you want to get a lot of mental fusion
[29:12.840 --> 29:15.800]  and DNA force plus, both at 50% off next Monday, the products are going back to full price because
[29:15.800 --> 29:16.800]  they're close to selling out.
[29:16.800 --> 29:19.880]  We won't have more back in stock for months.
[29:19.880 --> 29:22.400]  Everybody should be on that mental fusion and DNA force plus.
[29:22.400 --> 29:27.440]  Just look at DNA force plus with the PQQ and the CoQ tenant so much more documented
[29:27.440 --> 29:31.240]  to clean out your cells, your mitochondria, take your immune system to the next level
[29:31.240 --> 29:35.480]  and even have your telomeres that your DNA lasts longer.
[29:35.480 --> 29:39.040]  This is the opposite of what the globalists are doing with their poison shots.
[29:39.040 --> 29:42.840]  This is actually giving your body the tools it needs to regenerate.
[29:42.840 --> 29:48.240]  Get DNA force plus and environmental fusion for a limited time for 50% off you've got
[29:48.240 --> 29:53.280]  until next Monday and if your purchase supports the broadcast, keep us on air.

[30:00.400 --> 30:05.800]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading
[30:05.800 --> 30:07.840]  a healthier life.
[30:07.840 --> 30:11.680]  Infowars has made it easier to make sure you're getting enough in your system with a supplement
[30:11.680 --> 30:13.280]  that contains both.
[30:13.280 --> 30:18.240]  This Infowars Life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase
[30:18.240 --> 30:19.840]  from the InfowarsStore.
[30:19.840 --> 30:24.680]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that
[30:24.680 --> 30:27.400]  contain the rose plant seeds.
[30:27.400 --> 30:32.240]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions
[30:32.240 --> 30:36.920]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have
[30:36.920 --> 30:37.920]  shown.
[30:37.920 --> 30:42.200]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important
[30:42.200 --> 30:46.840]  role in nutrition, immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[30:46.840 --> 30:51.920]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate even in affluent populations
[30:51.920 --> 30:52.920]  like here in America.
[30:52.920 --> 30:57.760]  So next time you visit be sure to check it out at InfowarsStore.com where we promise
[30:57.760 --> 30:59.760]  our rose hips don't lie.

[31:08.720 --> 31:11.200]  and I've got their number and I know how to bring them down.

[31:24.000 --> 31:26.840]  to back down and I'll never give up but I could give out.
[31:26.840 --> 31:30.520]  So please keep me on the field, keep me on the front lines against the enemy while getting

[33:13.480 --> 33:19.880]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of
[33:19.880 --> 33:22.880]  the Infowar.
[33:22.880 --> 33:32.440]  Alright, I'm going to have to move fast because I've got more than 40 articles and documents
[33:32.440 --> 33:33.440]  here.
[33:33.440 --> 33:38.000]  I want to show TV viewers and I want to mention to radio listeners, a lot of this information
[33:38.000 --> 33:44.560]  is on Infowars.com, if you're a radio listener, you can just write down what I say and just
[33:44.560 --> 33:48.160]  search engine it and you will be able to find it even on places like Google.
[33:48.160 --> 33:55.160]  But I'd use DuckDuckGo or even Bing, Microsoft phones, it's a lot better than Google, Google
[33:55.160 --> 33:59.640]  is a broken search engine by design, but you can still get some information if you have
[33:59.640 --> 34:03.120]  the exact correct search term.
[34:03.120 --> 34:05.120]  So let's go over this.
[34:05.120 --> 34:13.200]  A bunch of big smoking guns today, smoking gun number one, COVID infection rates higher
[34:13.200 --> 34:18.120]  among vaccinated Australian government data shows, now it's the exact same numbers, basically
[34:18.120 --> 34:25.280]  the same numbers in every country that rolled out these experimental mRNA shots that China
[34:25.280 --> 34:30.440]  and Russia and a bunch of other countries refuse to take or even let in the nation because
[34:30.440 --> 34:34.440]  they're not vaccines.
[34:34.440 --> 34:38.040]  We have all statistics and numbers on that, we're going to go over it.
[34:38.040 --> 34:42.920]  Then we've got this article on Infowars.com by Jamie White, he wrote yesterday that I'm
[34:42.920 --> 34:48.160]  going to have moved back to the top or into the live show feed article.
[34:48.160 --> 34:53.600]  COVID Syop exposed network of doctors who pushed masking lockdowns on Twitter during
[34:53.600 --> 34:56.720]  pandemic don't exist.
[34:56.720 --> 35:02.720]  Now this is something that has been pointed out by several newspapers that have now discovered
[35:02.720 --> 35:04.560]  it, but they're asking who's doing it.
[35:04.560 --> 35:08.040]  Well, we went and tracked it back, we know who's behind it.
[35:08.040 --> 35:11.680]  In fact, they told us almost three years ago who was doing it.
[35:11.680 --> 35:16.880]  Defense agencies and our own Defense Department in unison with the Defense Departments of
[35:16.880 --> 35:24.920]  the Ministries of Defense of Israel, New Zealand, Australia, the EU, Canada, the list goes on
[35:24.920 --> 35:25.920]  and on.
[35:25.920 --> 35:30.520]  I'm going to show you the actual documents, but if you go to Jamie White's article, it's
[35:30.520 --> 35:35.280]  just full of dozens of links and screenshots of the prior admissions.
[35:35.280 --> 35:40.240]  So let me say this is government sponsored brainwashing and disinformation, it's not
[35:40.240 --> 35:43.160]  our opinion, it's a fact.
[35:43.160 --> 35:49.320]  COVID Syop exposed network of doctors who pushed masking lockdowns on Twitter during
[35:49.320 --> 35:53.440]  pandemic don't exist.
[35:53.440 --> 35:56.960]  Think about that.
[35:56.960 --> 36:00.160]  Now let's get into the actual documents.
[36:00.160 --> 36:03.920]  This is out of the times of London.
[36:03.920 --> 36:07.120]  This is from a year and a half ago.
[36:07.120 --> 36:15.480]  Three spies to take on anti-vax militants and headlines, let them telegraph.
[36:15.480 --> 36:22.440]  Government used fear, mind control to brainwash public into masking, social distancing, lockdowns
[36:22.440 --> 36:24.440]  and shots.
[36:24.440 --> 36:31.880]  You've got to go read his article about it because it links to so many of the examples
[36:31.880 --> 36:38.520]  of what you call crisis actors, completely fake people posting fake videos, reading
[36:38.520 --> 36:39.520]  scripts.
[36:39.520 --> 36:45.960]  But I'm an ER doctor, I'm a heart surgeon, these shots are totally safe, oh, on and
[36:45.960 --> 36:49.760]  on and on and on.
[36:49.760 --> 36:53.920]  All run by big corporate PR firms, you know who else was involved in this?
[36:53.920 --> 36:59.920]  Sam Bankman Freed and his company put hundreds of millions of dollars the last three years
[36:59.920 --> 37:00.920]  into all of this.
[37:00.920 --> 37:05.120]  So we could spend an entire hour just on that.
[37:05.120 --> 37:11.600]  But talk about smoking gun, that's what this is, it's a military industrial complex information
[37:11.600 --> 37:13.800]  warfare operation.
[37:13.800 --> 37:17.200]  You see Dr. Robert Malone, the inventor of mRNA going out giving speeches everywhere
[37:17.200 --> 37:21.480]  making that point, I'm glad he's bringing this up because it is a really big deal.
[37:21.480 --> 37:24.880]  Of course, you got it here almost three years ago.
[37:24.880 --> 37:29.720]  In late January, you got the whole story before it happened about what was going to happen.
[37:29.720 --> 37:32.360]  People go back and watch those shows and they go, is this even real?
[37:32.360 --> 37:34.720]  How the hell did he know all this?
[37:34.720 --> 37:40.320]  Because I'm studying what they're doing and they put it in the legislation.
[37:40.320 --> 37:45.520]  They had it in legislation 12 years ago, 13 years ago, and then you in plans for everything
[37:45.520 --> 37:47.080]  we just watched the last three years.
[37:47.080 --> 37:51.800]  They've been drilling and preparing and getting ready.
[37:51.800 --> 37:56.200]  Adam Corolla went on Fox and made a great point, he's not ready to give amnesty to
[37:56.200 --> 38:01.280]  the people that suppress nutraceuticals, that suppressed therapeutics, that locked
[38:01.280 --> 38:04.840]  our kids down and hurt them so bad and knew the mask didn't work, but lied to the public
[38:04.840 --> 38:08.400]  and pushed these poison shots to the racial immune system.
[38:08.400 --> 38:12.120]  No, we're not giving them amnesty, they committed crimes against humanity.
[38:12.120 --> 38:17.520]  Plus, they're not stopping, they're still pushing more lockdowns and more forced injections.
[38:17.520 --> 38:21.640]  The Congress passed the new defense authorization saying you can't make troops take an experimental
[38:21.640 --> 38:24.200]  shot cutting the funding, that's what Congress is supposed to do.
[38:24.200 --> 38:31.080]  They're most effective power, power the purse string, and guess what happened?
[38:31.080 --> 38:38.240]  The Navy said, we don't care what Congress says, well, they should have their commissions
[38:38.240 --> 38:44.360]  removed, those admirals, following Biden's criminal orders, but here's Adam Corolla
[38:44.360 --> 38:49.560]  saying he's not ready to grant pandemic amnesty to journalists and experts.
[38:49.560 --> 38:53.360]  They have no reverse gear, they don't know how to just sort of back off.
[38:53.360 --> 38:58.100]  A lot of them like to reconstruct history and go, what's wrong with having a difference
[38:58.100 --> 38:59.100]  of opinion?
[38:59.100 --> 39:02.880]  No, you're trying to cancel people who thought differently than you.
[39:02.880 --> 39:08.640]  I sent a tweet out two and a half years ago that said this is killing old people and sick
[39:08.640 --> 39:13.920]  people and the rest you got played and who's getting played next time.
[39:13.920 --> 39:18.800]  And I was pilloried for that and I had some celebrity friends call me and say take the
[39:18.800 --> 39:23.440]  tweet down and I said no, I'm not taking it down because I'm right.
[39:23.440 --> 39:28.600]  The people that attacked everyone who turned out to be right need to be punished at this
[39:28.600 --> 39:29.600]  point.
[39:29.600 --> 39:35.400]  I'm not talking about setting the grandma's Winnebago on fire, I'm talking about called
[39:35.400 --> 39:40.520]  out in the public square and told they were wrong repeatedly.
[39:40.520 --> 39:45.720]  They want to turn the page, they want to shut down schools, ruin kids, get people de-platform
[39:45.720 --> 39:51.720]  fired, disgraced amongst other colleagues and now, oops, we were wrong, well, turn the
[39:51.720 --> 39:53.200]  other cheek and turn the page.
[39:53.200 --> 39:55.600]  No, that's not how life works.
[39:55.600 --> 39:59.840]  You were wrong, you bet on the Super Bowl, you bet big and you lost.
[39:59.840 --> 40:00.840]  Now it's time to...
[40:00.840 --> 40:06.400]  You know, I like Adam Corolla a lot, but here's where he falls down and here's where people
[40:06.400 --> 40:12.040]  like Jordan Peterson do as well because driving to Big Bend, eight hours and driving back
[40:12.040 --> 40:16.440]  eight hours, I listen to a bunch of podcasts and I listened to Adam Corolla and I listened
[40:16.440 --> 40:22.520]  to Jordan Peterson and Jordan Peterson, I'll talk about this next hour, he would go through
[40:22.520 --> 40:27.560]  all the evidence of cutting energy off, doesn't work and kills people and all the communism
[40:27.560 --> 40:34.640]  doesn't work and the shots don't work, but they just don't know better.
[40:34.640 --> 40:41.400]  They're just stupid, they just don't understand, no, they developed and created the virus,
[40:41.400 --> 40:46.080]  they made the vaccine, the so-called vaccine before they ever released the virus on the
[40:46.080 --> 40:50.920]  record, I'll cover it next hour and show the evidence and then they suppressed everyone
[40:50.920 --> 40:57.160]  about the origin day one and therapeutics day one and what the so-called vaccines would
[40:57.160 --> 41:03.760]  do day one, they'd already done rat studies with weaponized gain of function coronaviruses
[41:03.760 --> 41:09.840]  at Chapel Hill, North Carolina, at the University of Texas, Galveston and all over the place.
[41:09.840 --> 41:15.160]  I mean, we have all the damn documents, we have the vice president of EcoHealth Alliance
[41:15.160 --> 41:24.480]  as a whistleblower, we have everything and I said I'd get into the speaker shenanigans
[41:24.480 --> 41:29.080]  and fiasco next segment, but I'll do that start of the next hour because I want to finish
[41:29.080 --> 41:36.520]  up with this and then I'll get back into what I was talking about with the whole origin
[41:36.520 --> 41:40.840]  of it and how they suppressed it, but the whole thing was completely organized.
[41:40.840 --> 41:45.120]  We have their emails from whistleblowers, we have their whole plan and so this idea
[41:45.120 --> 41:49.960]  that oh, they just don't believe capitalism works, no, they're ultra-rich, powerful elites
[41:49.960 --> 41:53.760]  that want to get rid of competition and get rid of the middle class and make us all poor
[41:53.760 --> 41:59.040]  to control us with social engineering, they're going to the technocracy that's worse than
[41:59.040 --> 42:05.960]  communism, the social credit score, the universal basic income, that's the plan they've announced
[42:05.960 --> 42:11.160]  and I listed all the so-called top intellectuals and none of them talk about the premeditated
[42:11.160 --> 42:17.480]  scientific takeover except Claus Schwab, he writes books, Harari writes books, they implement
[42:17.480 --> 42:21.160]  all their plans, we're living under it, what they say they're going to do they do, they're
[42:21.160 --> 42:31.080]  in control and they won't be stopped until we have opposition that says no, this is on
[42:31.080 --> 42:37.240]  purpose, Adam Corolla, they didn't bet on the Super Bowl and mess up and just hope this
[42:37.240 --> 42:43.280]  is going to work, they tested it on rats, they do the same vaccine in rats, cause heart
[42:43.280 --> 42:47.840]  attacks and infertility and death and the rats lived half as long on average, but I'll
[42:47.840 --> 42:59.880]  show you new national statistics out showing it's killing you when we come back.
[42:59.880 --> 43:05.440]  Keeping this important announcement on the afternoon of Thursday, January 5th, 2023 and

[47:24.040 --> 47:28.680]  All over the world top sciences are coming out exposing the death they call by these
[47:28.680 --> 47:35.080]  franken shots, but more importantly parents and family members and children are coming
[47:35.080 --> 47:49.560]  out and telling the world what's happened to their loved ones, what's happening to their
[47:49.560 --> 47:53.800]  family members when they take these poison shots.
[47:53.800 --> 48:00.960]  My adult son is 25 years old, he was a bodybuilder and a professional living in New York, makes
[48:00.960 --> 48:04.000]  me look like I never stepped foot in a gym in my life.
[48:04.000 --> 48:09.520]  Now he is disabled, he cannot drive himself, after I finish this meeting with you all today
[48:09.520 --> 48:15.680]  I have to take him to his cardiology appointment, he's been hospitalized 4 times, he has myocarditis
[48:15.680 --> 48:20.560]  and POTS, he can no longer work, he can no longer support himself and I have to carry
[48:20.560 --> 48:26.000]  him on my insurance, not to mention care for him, cook for him and he cannot do anything
[48:26.000 --> 48:27.000]  on his own.
[48:27.000 --> 48:30.760]  I've not been a religious person but I'm absolutely clear in my mind the only people,
[48:30.760 --> 48:35.600]  the kind of planning and thinking it takes to have done what has happened are people
[48:35.600 --> 48:41.200]  who would worship Satan, they're not normal people, they've jabbed I don't know 4 billion,
[48:41.200 --> 48:46.160]  6 billion poor souls, something like 1 in a thousand people have died, we don't know
[48:46.160 --> 48:50.720]  how many more will die but we're into double figures of millions who've definitely been
[48:50.720 --> 48:55.320]  killed as a consequence of this policy and that tells you the people who are doing this
[48:55.320 --> 49:04.080]  are ruthless I'd say diabolical, we're beyond good and right okay, we're in the good versus
[49:04.080 --> 49:05.080]  evil.
[49:05.080 --> 49:12.120]  They knew exactly what they were doing so they suppressed all the reports of the adverse
[49:12.120 --> 49:19.200]  reactions day one, they knew what was coming, they'd already tested it on rats and pigs,
[49:19.200 --> 49:24.360]  they knew exactly what was about to happen.
[49:24.360 --> 49:29.040]  Premeditated organized surveillance of what you were saying and doing including medical
[49:29.040 --> 49:34.120]  professionals and scientists to suppress them to see if they could get away with permanent
[49:34.120 --> 49:38.480]  lockdowns and forced injections that don't just attack your cardiovascular system but
[49:38.480 --> 49:45.000]  also your fertility, let's plunge back into it, Fauci responds to alleged upcoming Fauci
[49:45.000 --> 49:50.080]  files says disinformation is the enemy, get the clip ready, he then goes on, the full
[49:50.080 --> 49:57.160]  interviews on infowars.com on CBS News and says there's no heart attacks or myocarditis
[49:57.160 --> 50:01.920]  that it's disinformation, it's very rare, no I'm going to show you the statistics, it's
[50:01.920 --> 50:09.760]  off the charts everywhere these franken shots are given and we said a year before they started
[50:09.760 --> 50:14.080]  the injections that this was going to happen because they were mRNA and they tested these
[50:14.080 --> 50:23.240]  before on rats, absolutely insane that by early 2000 we were warning of what was about
[50:23.240 --> 50:27.480]  to unfold because we tracked them, we tracked the globalist and what they studied, what
[50:27.480 --> 50:32.880]  they'd done and that's how Dr. Michael Yidon in December of 2000 along with Wolfgang Wudarg,
[50:32.880 --> 50:40.480]  the chief advisor to the EU Medical Board, filed an emergency lawsuit in 2020 in Germany
[50:40.480 --> 50:45.320]  with the EU saying do not give this, it's going to cause heart attacks, it's going to
[50:45.320 --> 50:50.920]  cause myocarditis, blood clots, infertility and of course lowering immune system, I'll
[50:50.920 --> 50:56.000]  show you documents in a moment on that front, how do they know, well Yidon had been the
[50:56.000 --> 51:02.040]  head of the vaccine program for 24 years at Pfizer, he was their damn vice president over
[51:02.040 --> 51:07.880]  the vaccine program, the director of their worldwide vaccine program, he's the world
[51:07.880 --> 51:15.800]  expert, the damn inventor of it said it would happen before they did it, they've had the
[51:15.800 --> 51:21.840]  technology 25 years, when they want to use it to help you it works, it does incredible
[51:21.840 --> 51:26.640]  things except a small percentage always have organ failure, about two, three percent depending
[51:26.640 --> 51:30.840]  on the study, they've done a bunch of it in humans, they did a couple of them late last
[51:30.840 --> 51:38.920]  year in New York and everyone that did it died, normally it's a lower statistic, this
[51:38.920 --> 51:46.160]  time it was total death, it was cancer cures and now they say they've got an mRNA for cancer
[51:46.160 --> 51:53.000]  and an mRNA for the flu, an mRNA for depression, an mRNA, it goes on and on, but remember in
[51:53.000 --> 51:59.480]  October before Yidon the CDC put on their website what they were predicting is adverse
[51:59.480 --> 52:05.920]  reactions, blood clots, myocarditis, heart attacks, but it doesn't matter, Fauci goes
[52:05.920 --> 52:11.000]  on TV and says it's all conspiracy theories, here he is.
[52:11.000 --> 52:16.560]  But again another conspiracy theory, complete nonsense is going to have some people make
[52:16.560 --> 52:22.120]  a decision for themselves and their family not to get vaccinated, which may cost them
[52:22.120 --> 52:26.760]  their lives, so that's the thing that's so horrible about it and if you want to go out
[52:26.760 --> 52:33.760]  spouting nonsense conspiracy theories and spreading it all around, fine except if it
[52:33.760 --> 52:43.320]  results in a person suffering and perhaps dying, evidence myocarditis was related to
[52:43.320 --> 52:52.040]  vaccines, it is a heart issue, I'm not a doctor, you are, that's a shred of evidence, a very
[52:52.040 --> 52:58.720]  small shred, right, and explain how then this can get completely, of course, in a very very
[52:58.720 --> 53:08.480]  rare case some of the mRNA vaccines can cause a self-limiting, almost invariably benign
[53:08.480 --> 53:13.760]  inflammatory response in the heart, which generally resolves in a very short period
[53:13.760 --> 53:14.760]  of time.
[53:14.760 --> 53:22.040]  It is very, very rare, when you compare that with the negative effects on the heart by
[53:22.040 --> 53:28.320]  myocarditis or pericarditis, which is inflammation of either the heart muscle or the covering
[53:28.320 --> 53:38.600]  of the heart and heart failure and heart medical problems, overwhelmingly COVID itself causes
[53:38.600 --> 53:39.600]  that in a...
[53:39.600 --> 53:43.240]  Okay, so let's just go ahead and stop right there.
[53:43.240 --> 53:50.160]  Now we're going to show you the actual facts, ladies and gentlemen, of this giant biological
[53:50.160 --> 53:53.240]  psychological warfare operation they've launched.
[53:53.240 --> 54:00.040]  The stories on infowars.com, I'm not asking, I'm begging you to save lives and to go to
[54:00.040 --> 54:04.400]  infowars.com and to get this article and to share it with everybody you know.
[54:04.400 --> 54:09.000]  Smoking gun, COVID infection rates, higher among vaccinated, Australian data reveals
[54:09.000 --> 54:16.120]  from one of the most populous states in Australia.
[54:16.120 --> 54:21.280]  Here are government statistic numbers for TV viewers.
[54:21.280 --> 54:27.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, the green is those that have had four doses.
[54:27.440 --> 54:43.680]  You see the green is up here at a 236.4 percent unvaccinated peak at 3.6 percent.
[54:43.680 --> 54:47.280]  I'm going to say that again, this is hospitalizations of the vaccinated.
[54:47.280 --> 54:51.040]  Then I have the death numbers, oh, they're the same, very, very similar.
[54:51.040 --> 54:59.120]  So you have a 3.6 percent chance if you've had no shots at its peak of being hospitalized
[54:59.120 --> 55:10.280]  for COVID and you have a 236 point, can't read that, the graph 0.4, I believe.
[55:10.280 --> 55:15.800]  The point is, I mean, you're down here at sea level if you haven't taken the shots.
[55:15.800 --> 55:21.760]  Then we've got no dose, down here at the bottom, flat lined.
[55:21.760 --> 55:24.800]  One dose is black, see that?
[55:24.800 --> 55:27.920]  Two doses is about the same.
[55:27.920 --> 55:35.000]  Three doses is above one or two doses and four doses is the King Daddy.
[55:35.000 --> 55:38.320]  If you fail that IQ test and take it, they want you dead.
[55:38.320 --> 55:42.920]  Look at that, ladies and gentlemen, and that's in the first round of shots and then the boosters.
[55:42.920 --> 55:43.920]  Look at those numbers.
[55:43.920 --> 55:47.400]  I'm going to have to get more into this next hour around the time and then I'll get the
[55:47.400 --> 55:52.920]  smoking gun breakdown of how this was created in the lab, how they preplanned it all, such
[55:52.920 --> 55:53.920]  incredible information.
[55:53.920 --> 55:58.640]  And quite frankly, we broke it all first, but Glenn Beck in a very short clip a year and
[55:58.640 --> 56:03.200]  a half ago with Tucker Carlson did a better job.
[56:03.200 --> 56:07.840]  So I'm going to play Glenn Beck next hour where he nailed it, nailed it, nailed it.
[56:07.840 --> 56:09.760]  But let me throw this out before we go to break.
[56:09.760 --> 56:12.200]  The enemies of freedom are trying to shut us down.
[56:12.200 --> 56:17.040]  We will stay on air, but we need your support, plus we've got great products you need.
[56:17.040 --> 56:20.200]  So if you want this information to continue to come out, we will stay on air, but we're
[56:20.200 --> 56:21.200]  in your hands.
[56:21.200 --> 56:25.120]  I need you to decide to boost your immune system, make yourself healthier and wealthier

[57:59.960 --> 58:04.360]  news and information, they are powerful and they change the world.
[58:04.360 --> 58:08.480]  The real red pill plus is one of our top sellers, but for over two years it's been sold out
[58:08.480 --> 58:10.200]  because of supply chain breakdowns.
[58:10.200 --> 58:14.480]  It's finally back in stock for 50% off at infowarstore.com.

[58:48.520 --> 58:49.520]  infowarstore.com.
[58:49.520 --> 58:55.120]  I've taken a lot of supplements over the years since high school, and they had great effects.
[58:55.120 --> 58:58.840]  And the science has gotten better and better and better over the years.
[58:58.840 --> 59:03.600]  And now with all the things we're bombarded with, and the water and the food and the feminizing
[59:03.600 --> 59:08.080]  factors, it is more important than ever to use the compounds God gave us to boost our
[59:08.080 --> 59:09.080]  natural male potential.

[59:49.200 --> 59:50.200]  Platinum.
[59:50.200 --> 59:59.800]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[59:59.800 --> 01:00:07.080]  This video is based on the work of Mark Passio from whatonearthishappening.com, specifically
[01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:12.120]  his recent video on de facto Satanism.
[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:18.360]  Today's Hollywood pop culture machine will have you believe that Satanists wear robes
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:23.800]  and practice ritualistic blood sacrifices while worshiping Satan.
[01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:29.600]  And while there may be some truth to this, it is mostly propaganda meant to conceal the
[01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:33.600]  reality of what Satanism actually is.
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:39.840]  True Satanism is a mindset and the Satan that is worshipped is within each and every one
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:40.840]  of us.
[01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:47.320]  It is most commonly known as our ego, the self is the true God of Satanism.
[01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:53.840]  The term Satanism is used to deceive religious people, to appear harmless to non-religious
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:01:01.880]  people, and also because it stems from the Hebrew word shatan, which means adversary.
[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:07.840]  Satan is the force of involution that opposes true spiritual evolution.
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:10.480]  It is the ego within us.
[01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:16.680]  Left to our own devices, the ego will try and convince us to think only of ourselves,
[01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:19.840]  which is exactly what Satanism is.
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:26.320]  And so a de facto Satanist is a person who holds this mindset, but does not consider
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:29.840]  themselves to be a Satanist.
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:34.200]  Organized Satanism stands against this sort of enlightenment.
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:40.600]  They believe human psychology and the laws of nature should be kept occulted or hidden
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:47.360]  from the public, and used to gain and retain power over the masses by keeping them ignorant
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:53.400]  as to how the mind and emotions work, while using this knowledge to manipulate the masses
[01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:56.600]  and ultimately enslave them.
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:02.560]  This is primarily done by cultivating the Satanist mindset among the masses, thereby
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:10.400]  turning the ignorant and unaware into a de facto Satanist as we think so we become.
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:15.440]  This mindset can be broken down into four main tenets of Satanism.
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:22.920]  The first and most important is selfishness, egotism, or what many know as narcissism.
[01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:26.160]  Self-preservation is the highest law.
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:32.200]  Live only for your own selfish desires, and only care about you and yours.
[01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:38.160]  It's a dog eat dog world, and if you must step on others to get what you want, then
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:39.560]  so be it.
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:42.720]  This is the basis of Satanic thinking.
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:47.200]  The second tenet of the Satanist mindset is moral relativism.
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:52.440]  This is the belief that there is no objective difference between right behavior and wrong
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:53.440]  behavior.
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:59.620]  It is the belief that nobody is ever objectively right or wrong, and that it's up to each
[01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:05.280]  individual person to decide for themselves what is right and what is wrong.
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:08.800]  The third tenet of Satanism is social Darwinism.
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:13.960]  This is the belief that it is natural and good for human society to be ruled by the
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:20.840]  most aggressive and dominant humans among us, and that it is by virtue of their genetics
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:27.600]  that these vicious humans deserve to be in positions of power and lead humanity as they
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:29.120]  so choose.
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:33.800]  The fourth tenet of Satanism is eugenics or dysgenics.
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:41.000]  This is the ideal conclusion of the Satanist mindset, since man is God and he gets to decide
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:46.480]  what is right and what is wrong, and since the natural order is for the most dominant
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:53.800]  genetics to have power, then the elite class ruling over us has every right to decide who
[01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:57.960]  is allowed to live and procreate and who must die.
[01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:02.900]  This is how all of society is conditioned to think, and this is how the high level
[01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:07.720]  Satanists are leading all of humanity into slavery.
[01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:13.520]  Most of humanity is operating under this de facto Satanic mindset, which is why it
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:16.480]  is called the Great Work to change it.
[01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:22.200]  The Great Work is the work of awakening the masses to the true nature of the ego mind,
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:28.640]  encouraging each and every individual to find the courage to face their own inner shadow
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:31.320]  and to practice natural law.
[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:35.960]  Natural law is the respect of others, put simply, it is love.
[01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:41.680]  If the majority of humanity is practicing love, then humanity will know freedom.
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:48.200]  But if the majority of humanity is practicing Satanism, then humanity will be enslaved.
[01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:54.600]  You can find much more of this information at whatonearthishappening.com.
[01:04:54.600 --> 01:05:00.800]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:05.520]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones, needs to support Infowars and

[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:16.880]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry, you guys have no idea how many people
[01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:22.000]  have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez, how many people have just been put on a launch
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.840]  pad to outer space because of Alex Jones, including myself.
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:30.400]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform, and
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:34.440]  I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:39.240]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and Tim Cass, the super
[01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:40.240]  Tim Cass IRL.
[01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:46.120]  Listen, what I'm saying is, do not take Alex Jones and band.video for granted because
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:48.440]  you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:53.160]  We need to support free speech systems right now, so go check out the store, go support
[01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:56.840]  their store, go support Infowars, leave a donation right now.
[01:05:56.840 --> 01:06:11.480]  Don't wait until they're gone.
[01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:16.000]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.120]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:24.800]  So we told you almost three years ago exactly what will unfold the enemy's operation.
[01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:27.720]  But I'll give credit where credit's due.
[01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:31.360]  About a year later, Glenn Beck figured it all out and did some excellent reporting on
[01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:32.360]  it.
[01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:40.720]  And in a six minute, 20 second clip of Tucker Carlson over a year ago, he laid it all out.
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:43.840]  Let's go back to these documents.
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:49.080]  Smoking gun, COVID infection rates higher among vaccinated Australian data reveals.
[01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:55.360]  Now these numbers out of Australia are almost the identical graphs to Israel, to Singapore,
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:59.480]  to the UK, to Germany, to Canada, the list goes on and on.
[01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:03.680]  And it's all in this article at Infowars.com, it's life saving.
[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:08.000]  So get this out on your email, on your text message, word of mouth.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.800]  Take it to church, take it to your work, warn people.
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:12.400]  They're counting on us just laying there.
[01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:16.600]  And again, if you just joined us, here's the statistics out of Australia.
[01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:28.080]  A 236.4% increase in hospital increases and visits and sickness from COVID versus a 3.6
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:32.400]  increase at the highest level for those that took no shots.
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:44.000]  You see a massive increase of 90.0% in people that took three shots.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:55.480]  You see a 78% increase in those that took two shots.
[01:07:55.480 --> 01:08:06.280]  You see a peak of 50 plus percent in people that took one shot.
[01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:12.160]  Now this is Dr. Robert W. Malone, MD, inventor of mRNA technology using the same New South
[01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:15.240]  Wales, Australia, COVID ICU admissions numbers.
[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:22.040]  And here you can see it, four doses, on average, 173% increase.
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:23.960]  I was giving you the peak.
[01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:28.440]  Three doses, a 95% increase on average.
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:30.960]  Two doses, a 60% increase.
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:35.120]  One dose, a 6% increase.
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:39.440]  Vaccinated a 0% increase in hospitalizations.
[01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:44.920]  That's his extrapolation of this data I just showed you.
[01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:46.920]  You just spent hours looking at this.
[01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:51.000]  This is from the government of Australia.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.200]  Look at that.
[01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:53.200]  That's four shots.
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:54.360]  That's three shots.
[01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:55.360]  That's two shots.
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:56.560]  That's one shot.
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:58.880]  That's zero shots.
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:02.560]  And zero shots means zero increase.
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:06.560]  Well, this is interesting.
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:11.080]  Vaccine death is the top trending topic on Twitter today.
[01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:12.440]  People are waking up to the truth.
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:17.920]  Finally, truth is the only protection from the relentless media and medical journal propaganda
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:24.280]  which causes people to be tragically complicit in their own demise.
[01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:27.280]  Here's some of the other articles on infowars.com.
[01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:30.880]  You know, we got to go to the Glenn Beck report and then I'll come back with the rest of this.
[01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:31.880]  This is too important.
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:34.080]  Here's Glenn Beck laying out the origins of it.
[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:36.720]  All this is on record, this is all true.
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:41.200]  However you feel that the Corona vaccine, imagine your children being given powerful
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:45.440]  drugs without your knowledge by unionized teachers.
[01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:46.600]  What's the appropriate response to this?
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:48.880]  Glenn Beck, our old friend, is the host of the Glenn Beck radio program.
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:51.280]  Of course, he joins us tonight on the story.
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:52.880]  Glenn, thanks so much for coming on.
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:53.880]  So you're a parent.
[01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:57.560]  How would you respond to something like this?
[01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:02.360]  I file a lawsuit with the teacher's union myself.
[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:04.680]  I can't believe what's going on, Tucker.
[01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:08.960]  It is completely out of control and you have to ask yourself, why?
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:10.880]  Why are they pushing this like this?
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:14.320]  What do they have to gain because it's not our health?
[01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:15.840]  I really don't believe that.
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:20.360]  Well, certainly not in the case of children where there is a demonstrated an actual risk.
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:24.600]  It's not, you know, not to every child but there is correct very little risk from coronavirus.
[01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:25.680]  So this is like crazy.
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:31.960]  So you've done some reporting on this on some of the incentives we may not be aware of
[01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:33.880]  behind these drugs.
[01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:35.160]  If you'll tell us what you found.
[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:41.840]  So, okay, so this is a two hour chalkboard that is condensed into about four minutes.
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:46.080]  So if you want to see the whole thing, it's at FauciLide.com, but I'll try not to sound
[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:48.040]  crazy and tie this together.
[01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:54.560]  Gain of function with, which Fauci says never happened, happened in November of 2015.
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:59.480]  It happened with Dr. Barrett, it was a published paper, November 2015.
[01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:06.440]  The USAID and Fauci with EcoHealth, they were funding it.
[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:08.280]  It was happening with the Wuhan people.
[01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:09.640]  So we know that.
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:15.240]  But what you may not know is in November, the same month that published paper comes out,
[01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:24.760]  the United States begins a partnership with Moderna and they are searching for mRNA coronavirus
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:28.680]  vaccines, kind of a weird coincidence.
[01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:30.680]  But wait, it gets worse.
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:38.560]  In this time, we skip to 2018, DARPA receives a proposal from Dr. Barrett, US guy, Dr. Shi
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:46.240]  from Wuhan and Peter Dazek from EcoHealth and, or EcoHealth, and DARPA sees this and
[01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:51.400]  says this is far too dangerous, we're rejecting your proposal.
[01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:57.640]  We don't know what happened from there, but we do know just about 12 months later in Wuhan
[01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:06.920]  where Peter Dazek, Dr. Shi, the Bat Lady and Dr. Barrett were all doing research on coronaviruses.
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:11.280]  About a year later, there's an outbreak and the outbreak actually begins according to
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:18.160]  documents that we have that have been smuggled out of China, that there were 10 hospitals
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:26.880]  involved by October with patients that were, we now know are coronavirus symptoms.
[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:28.800]  They didn't know what was going on.
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:30.200]  Now that was in October.
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:34.560]  Remember, we didn't know anything about this in December.
[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:36.560]  We were starting to get rumblings.
[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:41.840]  China said there was some sort of an outbreak on December 31st, but Peter Daz, I'm sorry,
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:52.320]  not Peter Dazek, Dr. Barrett signs a government deal with Moderna, I want to read it exactly
[01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:53.320]  to you.
[01:12:53.320 --> 01:13:00.200]  This deal was made, it's confidential, it's 158 pages long.
[01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:09.520]  It is, if I skip to page 104, they are entering a specific private confidential agreement.
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:15.800]  The NIH appears to be transferring technology to Dr. Barrett, but what they're making clear
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:29.080]  is, quote, mRNA coronavirus vaccine candidates developed and jointly owned by NIAID and Moderna.
[01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:32.960]  Now this is weird because it's two weeks later that we know there's a problem.
[01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:39.080]  They signed that deal two weeks before and they signed it with the doctor who happened
[01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:43.080]  to be a partner with the Bat Lady in Wuhan.
[01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:45.520]  Here's where it gets really dark.
[01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:51.200]  These are the same group of people that in the end of January begin to have meetings
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:58.960]  and they shut down and begin to smear anyone who's looking into the lab leak theory.
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:03.920]  They establish that's not true, don't even look there.
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:06.960]  It appears to be collusion.
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:10.880]  We've passed this on to several people in Congress and the Senate.
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:16.440]  We know Rand Paul is on this and Dr. Fauci has some answers to give.
[01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:19.080]  Well, I just want to affirm what you're saying.
[01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:22.080]  You're the amazing reporting you've done on this.
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:27.280]  Here's a clip of the recently departed NIH Director, Francis Collins, admitting on camera
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:30.160]  that the U.S. government has a stake in the VAX.
[01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:31.160]  Watch this.
[01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:33.000]  Who's going to own that vaccine?
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.240]  Does the federal government own it?
[01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:38.320]  One of the vaccines, the one that's furthest along, was started actually at the federal
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:43.800]  government in our own vaccine research center at NIH and then worked with a biotechnology
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:48.560]  company called Moderna to get to where we are now with very impressive phase one results
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:52.320]  and getting ready to go into a large-scale trial as early as July.
[01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:59.640]  That one, of course, we do have some particular stake in the intellectual property.
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:01.480]  You are not making this up.
[01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:03.480]  What you're saying is true.
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:07.720]  Really quickly, why is this not a front page story everywhere?
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:12.320]  All of the documents we spent about a year on this with people like Charles Ricksley
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:16.600]  from Drastic, with Judicial Watch, they were all foyid.
[01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:23.200]  These are documents that prove beyond, I think, any kind of reasonable doubt something very
[01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:25.320]  wrong is happening here.
[01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:31.480]  Moderna had been turned down for any kind of vaccine research by everyone publicly
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:37.680]  over and over again, and now this test is being done on our children.
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:43.080]  This is the only time that anybody will admit they were doing any kind of testing on coronavirus
[01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:47.400]  research for a vaccine with Moderna.
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:52.640]  That's just, it's just beyond belief, and I'm glad finally that someone is saying this
[01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:53.640]  out loud.
[01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:55.240]  Glenn Beck, I appreciate your reporting on this.
[01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:56.240]  Thank you.
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:58.240]  It's great to see you tonight.
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:04.320]  So, when I first started taking survival skills, basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight.
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:09.240]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe, I was barely holding on to a job, and I heard
[01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:11.280]  Dr. Grip on your show and I listened to it.
[01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:15.840]  So, the first one I got was the original survival shield, the X1, and it worked pretty good.
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:19.720]  And then shortly thereafter, you came out with that, you know, with a deeper source,
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:23.560]  you know, and I got really excited about that, so I took it, and man, in two weeks, I went
[01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:29.520]  from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened, you know, I could think again,
[01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:31.480]  I could connect with people again.
[01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:35.880]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back, and I religiously
[01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:39.920]  take basically all of your supplements, they're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:44.720]  The one I like recently is knockout, literally, like if you want to sleep, just take it, it's
[01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:45.720]  amazing, it works.
[01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:49.480]  But anyway, so the point is, we have to get ourselves clean, we have to break free of
[01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:53.480]  the globalist system, and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:54.480]  own hands.
[01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:59.560]  Beautifully said, brother, I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:03.160]  I've taken a lot of supplements over the years since high school, and they had great
[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:07.960]  effects, and the science has gotten better and better and better over the years.
[01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:12.720]  And now with all the things we're bombarded with, and the water and the food and the feminizing
[01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:17.200]  factors, it is more important than ever to use the compounds God gave us to boost our
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:18.200]  natural male potential.
[01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:20.840]  But these products work great for women as well.
[01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:24.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have Pain MD, it's the number one natural best seller under
[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:25.680]  another name.
[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:30.960]  We've got it discounted for 40% off InfoWarsStore.com under the label InfoWars Platinum.

[01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:15.240]  Including a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:29.720]  So you just saw a clip of Glenn Beck in the middle of 2001, 2021, almost two years ago,
[01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:33.640]  telling you the whole history of how they created the virus, created the vaccine before
[01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:38.200]  they released it, released the virus, and suppressed everybody so they can't speak
[01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:42.520]  out, block therapeutics, lie about what the shots really do.
[01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:47.040]  And I'm very thankful Glenn Beck did the research and did all that.
[01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:48.040]  We did it before he did.
[01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:49.040]  It's not about who gets the credit.
[01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:50.920]  I just want to stop this madness.
[01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:55.640]  I want to stop this evil.
[01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:59.480]  But where are we now a year and a half after Glenn Beck said all that?
[01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:04.720]  The very same criminals that carried out this attack are preparing new attacks.
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:06.560]  Now listen to these headlines.
[01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:12.320]  UK government whistleblower reveals massive spike in excess deaths since Cobra Jab rollout
[01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:22.280]  more than 1,000 a week in the UK alone, directly linked to the shots, and it gets worse.
[01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:27.200]  FDA deviated from normal process in Pfizer vaccine approval documents show.
[01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:30.840]  We knew this when they did this two years ago.
[01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:31.840]  There was no testing.
[01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:36.440]  In fact, in the letter that's now circulating, this has all been secret, but now lawsuits
[01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:40.480]  have made them release the government agreement.
[01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:44.200]  It says, you should not consider this shot safe.
[01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:47.600]  We have no data on it when they approved it.
[01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:51.760]  That's why I remember the nurses would open up the little injection models and they have
[01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:55.520]  a piece of paper in them that tells you with any drug about its history, how it was tested,
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:56.520]  what it does, side effects.
[01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:59.280]  That's why it was blank.
[01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:07.080]  There wasn't even an ingredients list on J&J or AstraZeneca or Pfizer or Moderna.
[01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:13.920]  And they weren't even mRNA shots, the J&J and AstraZeneca, because it was all emergency
[01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:14.920]  authorized.
[01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:18.400]  Now they're going to emergency authorize all these new so-called vaccines.
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:22.360]  The deviation from normal practices is done to facilitate product labeling, distribution,
[01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:28.400]  and is consistent with other center practices to facilitate vaccine delivery during a public
[01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:34.240]  health emergency, said the head of the FDA's management team.
[01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:38.040]  When providing the license number, we should communicate that this license number does
[01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:47.040]  not constitute any determination by FDA of the application, any determination.
[01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:54.800]  And they go on and describe that the determination means it has not been tested, and they do
[01:22:54.800 --> 01:23:05.880]  not know its efficacy, since no approval was given in the decision.
[01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:11.360]  The applicant request of the U.S. license number, Bio-Initech Manufacturing, GMBH, with
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:15.760]  the agreement that they will not use it until after the VLA is approved, the document, a
[01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:22.240]  summary of the June 29, 2021, FDA meeting discussing Pfizer's application stated.
[01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:28.400]  And it goes on to say, the summary does not say it's been tested, and will you not even
[01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:31.160]  know what it is?
[01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:37.680]  But they told you it was all safe and effective and totally tested.
[01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:40.880]  And then we don't just have the documents and the insurance company numbers and the government
[01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:45.800]  numbers of the record heart attacks among herditis and death, but the erasure of your
[01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:50.160]  immune system where you're way more likely to get sick and die if you've had the injections.
[01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:51.880]  And now we've got all these videos.
[01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:56.920]  Every day, so many videos, I can't even talk about them all, much less play them.
[01:23:56.920 --> 01:24:02.320]  I've got more than 10 videos today of people collapsing and having heart attacks and falling
[01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:03.320]  down.
[01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:05.000]  I didn't even give the crew, but three of them.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.240]  There's no way to get to them all.
[01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:14.320]  No, infowars.com, college basketball player clutches heart, collapses during game.
[01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:19.760]  Emo Essen of the Old Dominion Monarchs is playing defense before suddenly falling to the floor
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:27.760]  while clutching his heart, followed by training staff rushing to his aid.
[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:28.760]  Here's another one.
[01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:37.160]  MMA rising star Victoria Lee, Dan at 18, reportedly had taken the shots.
[01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:40.480]  And it goes on and on, but Fauci says it's all safe.
[01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:41.480]  There's no problems.
[01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:42.480]  It's all made up.
[01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:47.200]  He says there's no connection to the shots and my card is CDC finally admits link between
[01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:56.060]  experimental COVID-19 jabs, my card is in young recipients, CDC admits confirmation
[01:24:56.060 --> 01:24:58.600]  link between heart inflammation and COVID facts.
[01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:03.960]  This was a year and a half ago, but it was in the October 2000 document.
[01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:09.240]  They predicted it would happen on screen, but don't worry.
[01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:10.240]  Reuters fact checked it.
[01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:14.880]  Even the Reuters president is on the board of Pfizer fact check graph showing increased
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:18.680]  microditis after COVID-19 vaccine rollout does not confirm link.
[01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:22.080]  Yes, the heart attacks and microcarditis and blood clots are off the charts.
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:23.080]  Yes, it's happening.
[01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:27.080]  And those that are injected, but we don't know it's the shots as Reuters fact checked.
[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:31.040]  Yeah, Biden said I'm going to open the border and flood the border and we're going to replacement
[01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:32.040]  migration you.
[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:33.920]  And it's a great thing to get rid of white people.
[01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:34.920]  That's a quote.
[01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:35.920]  It's a good thing.
[01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:44.240]  Played it last hour, but he didn't mean what he said said the Reuters fact checkers.
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:45.240]  Absolutely insane.
[01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:47.080]  And it goes on and on and on.
[01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:49.840]  I've got so many more of these.
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:54.360]  And now they're coming up with ways to suppress the people, not just here, but in China.
[01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:58.080]  China suspends social media accounts of COVID policy critics.
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:01.960]  They know if you criticized it, you can't get a job or leave your house or go on a train
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:07.720]  or drive your car, if you have criticized anything they did.
[01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:08.720]  But that's okay.
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:14.000]  Because Jimmy Fallon is singing about XBB one five, the best COVID variant yet.
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.120]  You actually sung a song about it.
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:18.320]  We'll play that the moment.
[01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:23.920]  Oh, but over in Australia, meet the biology professor who named the surging crack and COVID
[01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:27.080]  variant who may be cracking will scare him.
[01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:29.960]  Oh, my goodness.
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:38.040]  And more videos of people physically assaulting those not wearing masks.
[01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:41.800]  Unbelievable.
[01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:48.240]  Let's play that clip that I just mentioned.
[01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:49.240]  Which one was it?
[01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:50.240]  There's so many here.
[01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:51.240]  Makes my head spin.
[01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:52.240]  Yeah.
[01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:56.880]  Here's here's Jimmy Fallon seeing a song to scare you and saying, we do wear masks again.
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:58.320]  There's a new scary thing.
[01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:00.320]  We do wear masks and you're all scared.
[01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:01.320]  Here it is.
[01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:08.320]  There was Alpha, then Delta, then Omicron X, but this latest variant might be the best.
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:15.320]  It's XBB point one point five, another brand of COVID-19 has arrived.
[01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:19.320]  It's a new strain, but it isn't the same.
[01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:23.320]  Sounds more like Elon Musk's kid's name.
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:30.320]  XBB point one point five, not UB 40 who sees red, red wine.
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:33.320]  Put on your mask when you're inside a facility.
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:37.320]  It could be a robot from a Star Wars trilogy.
[01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:46.320]  It's XBB point one point five, not OMG or MP3 or DCBY or an eye chart made by a really
[01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:47.320]  high guy.
[01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:54.320]  Sounds like the password of your parents.
[01:27:54.320 --> 01:28:01.320]  XBB point one point five, XBB point one point five.
[01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:05.320]  Wear your mask, live in fear, take your shots, then erase your immune system and kill you
[01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:06.320]  all on record.
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:08.240]  Meanwhile, here's Time Magazine.
[01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:13.520]  The U.S. keeps offering China, it's COVID vaccines, China keeps saying no because it's
[01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:21.520]  a bio weapon for depopulation brought to you by the New World Order.
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:26.520]  BioLinotech says it will start cancer vaccine trials in the U.K. from September.
[01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:31.520]  Oh, COVID-19 to make Australian populations smaller and older.
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:35.520]  Less people being born, killing more people.
[01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:37.520]  All right, I'm done talking about the shots.
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:42.520]  I got a ton of news to head on what happened last week in Congress and what's going forward
[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:45.520]  with the economy and the IRS and so much more.
[01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:50.520]  Big broadcasts in the last 30 minutes ahead of Harrison Smith as your special guest and
[01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:55.520]  a big debate he's got tonight with two special guests on JFK assassination.
[01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:59.520]  That is coming up on Sunday Night Live.
[01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:02.520]  They want the planet for themselves, my friends.
[01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:05.520]  If we're so stupid, we let them kill us.
[01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:07.520]  We deserve it.
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:13.520]  Children don't deserve it, do they?
[01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:32.520]  And I looked and behold a pale horse and he that sat on the horse was named death.
[01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:39.520]  Now the translation is I looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him
[01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:42.520]  was death and hell followed with him.
[01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:45.520]  A book of Revelation.
[01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:47.520]  Very serious times to be alive, folks.
[01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:49.520]  They're not just doing this as a one-off.
[01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:51.520]  This is the beginning of the rest of our lives.
[01:29:51.520 --> 01:29:53.520]  This is our fight and I'm proud of humanity.
[01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:55.520]  The globalists even admit it's leaked.
[01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:59.520]  They're very upset that they're losing and that this hasn't gone the way they thought it would.
[01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:02.520]  You want to beat the New World Order? You want to stop their globalist agenda?
[01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:04.520]  Well, so do I.
[01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:08.520]  And I've been the most affected individual in the fight against the globalist
[01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:11.520]  and I've got their number and I know how to bring them down.
[01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:15.520]  But, ladies and gentlemen, I can't do it without your support.
[01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:19.520]  And the good news is we're only under about $200,000 a month.

[01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:40.520]  They're all different formulas.
[01:32:40.520 --> 01:32:44.520]  But this one is particularly the strongest one we have.
[01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:47.520]  So, Gallon Out sold out for more than five months.
[01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:52.520]  It's now back available at Infowarsstore.com, so get better, deeper rest,
[01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:55.520]  boost your immune system, and support the Infowar.
[01:32:55.520 --> 01:33:20.520]  With Gallon Out Sleep Support in Infowarsstore.
[01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:51.520]  All right, so it's easy to get up here and score points against Matt Gage,
[01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:56.520]  or Marjorie Taylor Greene at the end, Matt Gage supporting Kevin McCarthy,
[01:33:56.520 --> 01:34:01.520]  who I can't stand and who is an establishment individual through and through.
[01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:07.520]  But because you have such a small Republican majority, as Roger Stone predicted six months ago,
[01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:09.520]  he predicted a very small majority in the House.
[01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:15.520]  It was an election fraud, and because the Republicans did a very bad job backing good candidates,
[01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:20.520]  chiefly among them, Kevin McCarthy, that when you had that small majority,
[01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:28.520]  that that 25 or so patriots in the House would be able to hold up legislation for the Democrats
[01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:31.520]  and the Republicans and exert incredible power.
[01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:35.520]  So for me, the fact that they held it up for a week, had 15 votes,
[01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:38.520]  and did all that was a raw exercise of power.
[01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:43.520]  You saw fist fights almost break out, you saw threats, you saw attacks.
[01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:47.520]  And so I don't think Matt Gage is bad at the end with his one vote they needed,
[01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:50.520]  going ahead and doing it because he got so many concessions.
[01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:57.520]  Now the question is how much of those concessions are going to be real, but it doesn't matter.
[01:34:57.520 --> 01:35:08.520]  Because now those 25 folks or so realize how much power they have with that razor-thin majority
[01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:13.520]  to be able to control the policy and discourse.
[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:19.520]  So this is a big sign of the power structure breaking up, losing control,
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:23.520]  and if you had a big House majority, some of them would be rhinos, they would be able to do this.
[01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:26.520]  So I'm not just seeing a silver lining in the cloud here.
[01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:28.520]  The right thing was to get rid of McCarthy.
[01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:32.520]  The right thing was, you know, to do what we were trying to do.
[01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:36.520]  But if you look what the Democrats are saying, they're in full panic mode,
[01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:42.520]  because if you think the squad of six communists was bad being able to swing votes for Democrats,
[01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:51.520]  imagine what 24, 25 you'd have baked the numbers, 24 and 27, depending on how their votes split.
[01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:54.520]  This is a nightmare for the establishment.
[01:35:54.520 --> 01:35:56.520]  People say, well, why did MTG do what she did?
[01:35:56.520 --> 01:35:58.520]  Why do you like MTG?
[01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:02.520]  Well, she supported a lot of good legislation, she supported free speech,
[01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:08.520]  she stood up for info wars, and she's had a lot of courage, and she is loyal to Trump.
[01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:13.520]  I have a lot of problems with Trump, but, you know, he's way better than people like Kev McCarthy.
[01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:21.520]  But you can't sit there and wall this off where you still love Trump,
[01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:26.520]  and a lot of critics still promote Trump, critics of MTG,
[01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:29.520]  critics of Republicans that voted for McCarthy,
[01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:32.520]  when Trump was instrumental on the telephone,
[01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:37.520]  hauling up people that he helped get elected and saying, I want you to support Kev McCarthy.
[01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:42.520]  So, we'll see if Trump's right, we'll see if Kev McCarthy does what he says he's going to do.
[01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:45.520]  I think this is an open question.
[01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:49.520]  I think it's, I think you do the right thing, may the heavens fall.
[01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:52.520]  I think we get rid of McCarthy, I supported getting rid of McCarthy,
[01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:55.520]  our talk show host without even telling them what to do.
[01:36:55.520 --> 01:36:58.520]  That's why I hired them, they're smart folks that, you know, just get on target.
[01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:02.520]  Owen Schreuer, Harrison Smith, they attacked McCarthy, we tried to defeat McCarthy,
[01:37:02.520 --> 01:37:05.520]  we thought he might have been defeated, I was very excited about that.
[01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:09.520]  On Thursday and Friday afternoon, it didn't happen.
[01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:14.520]  Now the fight is about making sure the agenda of securing the border,
[01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:18.520]  stopping the fentanyl, ending the Ukraine war,
[01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:21.520]  and starting the impeachment of Joe Biden goes forward.
[01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:23.520]  And McCarthy has said he wouldn't do that,
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:27.520]  but the word is he's giving concessions now to let that go forward.
[01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:32.520]  Let's see, but if he cheats those 25 Republicans,
[01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:40.520]  they're the swing vote, now they're really going to be able to put his wave-os in a vice.
[01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:46.520]  And that's what we are talking about right now.
[01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:51.520]  So, Kevin McCarthy and the newer Lord of Deep State had their Pyrrhic victory.
[01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:53.520]  It's a victory you win, but you lose the war.
[01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:58.520]  If we keep the pressure to them, and if those 25 people that saw the power they had
[01:37:58.520 --> 01:38:01.520]  by holding out, and they got these concessions,
[01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:04.520]  you know, if he doesn't follow the contract he gave them,
[01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:08.520]  if he doesn't follow the agreements he gave them,
[01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:10.520]  well, then now they can vote against him,
[01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:14.520]  and next time they'll be once bitten, twice shot.
[01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:17.520]  So, very interesting time to be alive.
[01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:19.520]  A lot of folks are going to watch the NFL playoffs.
[01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:21.520]  A lot of folks are obsessed with that. I could care less.
[01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:23.520]  Because this actually affects my children.
[01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:25.520]  This affects your future, your children.
[01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:28.520]  This affects the entire human race right now.
[01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:31.520]  Let's all say it again.
[01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:34.520]  I've got calls, text messages. You should come out against MTG.
[01:38:34.520 --> 01:38:37.520]  Should I come out against Trump?
[01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:39.520]  I've been critical of Trump on the poison shot.
[01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:41.520]  Lisa didn't try to make it mandatory.
[01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:42.520]  Didn't want the military to have to take it.
[01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:45.520]  He said, if you want it, take it.
[01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:48.520]  He's light years better than Democrats trying to make it mandatory.
[01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:50.520]  I'm not even defending that. I've been a huge critic of it.
[01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:54.520]  What I'm saying is, we're in the middle of this now.
[01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:58.520]  And we have the hand we've been dealt.
[01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:00.520]  You've got to play the hand you're dealt.
[01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:04.520]  And it's a pretty damn good hand if those 23, 26, 27,
[01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:07.520]  depending on the numbers you look at,
[01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:11.520]  25 members of Congress, if they stay true.
[01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:13.520]  And I think from what you just saw,
[01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:16.520]  and the fact they went from being irrelevant and denied committees
[01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:18.520]  by the Republicans, by the Democrats,
[01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:21.520]  being shunned, seeing their real power now,
[01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:25.520]  I believe you've just seen the beginning of this huge awakening.
[01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:28.520]  And now people now get, instead of just being a cog in a machine
[01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:30.520]  and doing what party leadership tells you,
[01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:33.520]  but by standing up for what your constituents want,
[01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:35.520]  I believe we're going to see real fireworks.
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:37.520]  In fact, I know we are.
[01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:39.520]  We're not going to win them all,
[01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:42.520]  but we're at least contending now to take our republic back.
[01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:45.520]  And the power structure is in a panic.
[01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:52.520]  So I don't want to hear any criticism of MTG
[01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:55.520]  from those talk show hosts who I'm not mad at.
[01:39:55.520 --> 01:40:00.520]  They have their free speech, but they all know who they are.
[01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:03.520]  I don't want to hear any criticism of Matt Gaines,
[01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:05.520]  who went ahead and flipped his vote at the last minute,
[01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:09.520]  Friday afternoon evening.
[01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:13.520]  If you don't, then hate Trump.
[01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:15.520]  Because Trump is the one that asked them to do that.
[01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:18.520]  MTG said three weeks ago, a month ago on the show,
[01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:20.520]  I'm supporting Kevin McClarty,
[01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:22.520]  because Trump trusts him and thinks the thing,
[01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:24.520]  and I'm loyal to Trump.
[01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:26.520]  She's a Trumpist.
[01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:28.520]  She said, I support Trump.
[01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:30.520]  I'm listening to Trump.
[01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:33.520]  She did that.
[01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:35.520]  So again, I feel good.
[01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:37.520]  My guts tell me she's good.
[01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:39.520]  I like her.
[01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:41.520]  You know, the left loves pedophilia and all this crap.
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:43.520]  She's been divorced and had an affair.
[01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:45.520]  It's like nobody's perfect.
[01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:47.520]  The point is, is that the left's like,
[01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:49.520]  oh, pedophilia's good, but this woman had an affair.
[01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:50.520]  She's the devil.
[01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:52.520]  It's all crap, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:40:52.520 --> 01:40:56.520]  It's all total BS.
[01:40:56.520 --> 01:41:00.520]  So again, I don't want to hear criticism
[01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:02.520]  of the Republicans that flipped their votes,
[01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:05.520]  including Gozer, who we know is hardcore and badass,
[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:06.520]  and the left hates him.
[01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:08.520]  He flipped his vote, too, because they saw
[01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:10.520]  that they got major concessions,
[01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:12.520]  how much power they have, and now they're going
[01:41:12.520 --> 01:41:14.520]  to start using it, so let's give them a chance
[01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:16.520]  and let's put pressure on them.
[01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:18.520]  I better see impeachment be moved for.
[01:41:18.520 --> 01:41:21.520]  I better see all sorts of action on that front,
[01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:23.520]  because it'll destroy Biden.
[01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:24.520]  It'll put him on trial.
[01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:26.520]  We need it yesterday.
[01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:30.520]  And if we're sitting here in a month or two,
[01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:34.520]  and I'm not hearing impeachment introduced by MTG,
[01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:37.520]  and I'm not seeing hearings on Hunter Biden,
[01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:39.520]  and hearings on fentanyl, and hearings on COVID,
[01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:45.520]  and hearings on Fauci, then I'm going to go completely ape.
[01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:48.520]  But this is their last chance.
[01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:50.520]  So that's where I'm at.
[01:41:50.520 --> 01:41:52.520]  I've really thought about this, really looked at it deeply,
[01:41:52.520 --> 01:41:54.520]  prayed about it, and that's where I'm at.
[01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:58.520]  I'm going to go Donkey Kong, King Kong crazy
[01:41:58.520 --> 01:42:04.520]  in about 45 days on Trump,
[01:42:04.520 --> 01:42:07.520]  because he's the one that led this.
[01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:11.520]  He's really put his name to this now.
[01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:13.520]  And I was just thinking about it last night.
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:15.520]  I'm like, Trump did this, Trump got my card at the end,
[01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:19.520]  and if he screws the pooch on this one, that's it.
[01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:21.520]  I'm not going to totally hate him and attack him
[01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:23.520]  and say he's the devil, but I'm going to be really angry
[01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:25.520]  and point it out.
[01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:29.520]  But the founders created separation of powers
[01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:32.520]  from governments like this, and I think we're going to see
[01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:34.520]  a lot more of what we just saw, and it's going to be even better.
[01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:36.520]  So I have a good feeling overall.
[01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:39.520]  But it's up to us, but pressure on these people.
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:41.520]  And I mean, I've told them, I've told them all,
[01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:43.520]  we better see impeachment.
[01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:46.520]  We better see cutting to the funding to Ukraine.
[01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:48.520]  We better see action now.
[01:42:48.520 --> 01:42:50.520]  You better be right.
[01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:53.520]  They have really, really put it on the line now,
[01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:55.520]  and they better deliver.
[01:42:55.520 --> 01:43:06.520]  All right, we're going to cover more of this when we come back.
[01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:36.520]  This is the opposite of what the globalists are doing
[01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:38.520]  with their poison shots.
[01:43:38.520 --> 01:43:41.520]  This is actually giving your body the tools it needs to regenerate.

[01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:47.520]  for 50% off.

[01:43:56.520 --> 01:44:25.520]  We'll be right back.
[01:44:26.520 --> 01:44:55.520]  Thank you.
[01:44:56.520 --> 01:45:04.520]  Why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing M4s,
[01:45:04.520 --> 01:45:07.520]  attacking myself and the crew and our other hosts?
[01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:09.520]  Because they know we're pro-human.
[01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:11.520]  They know we're telling the truth.
[01:45:11.520 --> 01:45:13.520]  They know we've got their number.
[01:45:13.520 --> 01:45:17.520]  They know everything we do is about empowering humanity.
[01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:20.520]  And God gave us, through Mother Nature, incredible compounds
[01:45:20.520 --> 01:45:23.520]  that will supercharge our body's stamina,
[01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:26.520]  energy, and immune systems.
[01:45:26.520 --> 01:45:29.520]  And we came out many years ago with Real Red Pill Plus
[01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:32.520]  that has all the documented compounds, like preglonone,
[01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:36.520]  and so much more to supercharge your body.
[01:45:36.520 --> 01:45:41.520]  And to give your body the key elements and the key ingredients
[01:45:41.520 --> 01:45:44.520]  it needs to function at a proper level.
[01:45:44.520 --> 01:45:47.520]  This is the answer to the New World Order's tyranny.
[01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:51.520]  This is Real Red Pill Plus, sold out for two years,
[01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:55.520]  right off at infowarstore.com.

[01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:02.520]  There's a war against our masculinity.
[01:46:02.520 --> 01:46:05.520]  There's a war in the environment, the food, the water,
[01:46:05.520 --> 01:46:08.520]  the air, the electromagnetics, the injections
[01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:12.520]  to really cut us off from what God designed us to be.
[01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:17.520]  But through Mother Nature, the Creator gave us compounds
[01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:20.520]  that can counteract what the globalists have done.
[01:46:20.520 --> 01:46:22.520]  And I got to tell you, all our supplements are great,
[01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:25.520]  but we've got a real game changer now.
[01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:27.520]  We've never put anything out that's powerful.
[01:46:27.520 --> 01:46:30.520]  It's InfoWars Platinum, now exclusively available
[01:46:30.520 --> 01:46:33.520]  at 40% off at infowarstore.com.

[01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:41.520]  under the brand name and private label
[01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:45.520]  of InfoWars Platinum at infowarstore.com.
[01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:52.520]  It's HGH Boost Max, it's Pain MD, and it's 1776 Testosterone Boost.
[01:46:52.520 --> 01:46:55.520]  Yule it to yourself and your way of life and your well-being
[01:46:55.520 --> 01:47:19.520]  to try these out and fund the InfoWars.
[01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:31.520]  Obviously tomorrow on the weekday show, 11 a.m. Central
[01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:33.520]  right after Harris and Smith of the American Journal,
[01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:36.520]  8 a.m. Central, InfoWars.com.
[01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:38.520]  I'll open the phones up for what you think
[01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:40.520]  of what happened last week with Congress
[01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:42.520]  and all the rest of it.
[01:47:42.520 --> 01:47:46.520]  And I'm not trying to put perfume or lipstick on a pig here.
[01:47:46.520 --> 01:47:50.520]  I know the situation, we better get rid of McCarthy
[01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:53.520]  and put somebody in like Matt Gaetz.
[01:47:53.520 --> 01:47:55.520]  But that's not what happened.
[01:47:55.520 --> 01:47:59.520]  But it's again, that sliver the Republicans have
[01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:02.520]  just like Senator Mnuchin is able to get what he wants
[01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:04.520]  and hold them up, and he's a globalist,
[01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:06.520]  but nothing compared to some of the worst globalists.
[01:48:06.520 --> 01:48:09.520]  He has all that power because he's that swing senator.
[01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:13.520]  We basically have Mnuchin on steroids now.
[01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:17.520]  So if those 25 Congress people hold the line
[01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:19.520]  on all these different bills and legislation,
[01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:23.520]  this is a big deal for the next two years.
[01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:26.520]  And they did fight hard and they did get a lot of concessions.
[01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:28.520]  So there's two ways to look at this.
[01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:30.520]  We'll be taking phone calls tomorrow.
[01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:31.520]  Obviously on the weekday show,
[01:48:31.520 --> 01:48:32.520]  I've got some huge guests in studio,
[01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:34.520]  an outside studio, I'm just gonna leave it at that.
[01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:35.520]  Be sure and tune in.
[01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:38.520]  But since we mentioned it, here's Kevin McCarthy
[01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:41.520]  giving his thanks to Trump that got him
[01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:43.520]  the speakership so narrowly.
[01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:44.520]  It's a good spanking for him.
[01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:46.520]  He's a horrible rhino.
[01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:48.520]  Don't trust him, don't like him.
[01:48:48.520 --> 01:48:50.520]  But here he is saying, who got him in there?
[01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:52.520]  So you want to blame somebody, folks?
[01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:53.520]  Blame Trump.
[01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:54.520]  And we'll see if Trump's right.
[01:48:54.520 --> 01:48:55.520]  But these are just the facts.
[01:48:55.520 --> 01:48:58.520]  Here it is.
[01:48:58.520 --> 01:49:00.520]  I'm gathered at that end to put it all through
[01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:02.520]  and just all the different members
[01:49:02.520 --> 01:49:05.520]  and hanging with me through all those different votes.
[01:49:05.520 --> 01:49:09.520]  But I do want to especially thank President Trump.
[01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:12.520]  I don't think anybody should doubt his influence.
[01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:14.520]  He was with me from the beginning.
[01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:17.520]  Somebody wrote the doubt of whether he was there
[01:49:17.520 --> 01:49:18.520]  and he was all in.
[01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:20.520]  He would call me and he would call others.
[01:49:20.520 --> 01:49:24.520]  And he really was, I was just talking to him tonight,
[01:49:24.520 --> 01:49:27.520]  helping get those final votes.
[01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:30.520]  What he's really saying really for the party in the country
[01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:32.520]  that we have to come together.
[01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:34.520]  We have to focus on the economy.
[01:49:34.520 --> 01:49:37.520]  We've got to focus, make our borders secure.
[01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:39.520]  We've got to do so much work to do
[01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:41.520]  and he was a great influence to make that all happen.
[01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:45.520]  So thank you, President Trump.
[01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:50.520]  So, and people will say, well, screw Trump.
[01:49:50.520 --> 01:49:51.520]  Yeah.
[01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:53.520]  And then you've got Joe Biden.
[01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:55.520]  The whole New World Order hated Trump
[01:49:55.520 --> 01:49:57.520]  because he went against much of their agenda.
[01:49:57.520 --> 01:50:00.520]  85, 90% of it.
[01:50:00.520 --> 01:50:03.520]  So we can try to sit there and figure this out
[01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:07.520]  but they're now putting out the agenda of the House
[01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:10.520]  and it looks like McCarthy is at least on paper
[01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:14.520]  following through on a lot of what he promised they would do.
[01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:18.520]  But an investigation of COVID,
[01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:20.520]  looking at cutting funding to Ukraine,
[01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:22.520]  that's all in there.
[01:50:22.520 --> 01:50:24.520]  I'll be covering it more tomorrow
[01:50:24.520 --> 01:50:26.520]  because it came out right as I was going on air
[01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:28.520]  but we're going to see what's got the other key points
[01:50:28.520 --> 01:50:29.520]  that we need.
[01:50:29.520 --> 01:50:31.520]  I'm sure Harrison Smith next hour is going to be covering that.
[01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:34.520]  In fact, Harrison is here asking to get the draft
[01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:37.520]  that Solomon and others have put out, John Solomon,
[01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:40.520]  and actually go over that agenda
[01:50:40.520 --> 01:50:42.520]  because that's a big, big deal
[01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:44.520]  to see how far he goes.
[01:50:44.520 --> 01:50:46.520]  But here it is, Town Hall.
[01:50:46.520 --> 01:50:48.520]  Trump reportedly had a large influence
[01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:50.520]  in securing the gavel for McCarthy.
[01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:52.520]  I know the inside baseball in this.
[01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:54.520]  I'm going to leave it at that but Trump was warned.
[01:50:54.520 --> 01:50:55.520]  Trump was told it was wrong.
[01:50:55.520 --> 01:50:57.520]  Trump was told to not support McCarthy
[01:50:57.520 --> 01:50:59.520]  and he said, no, no, McCarthy promises me.
[01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:01.520]  He's on board with our Make America Great agenda.
[01:51:01.520 --> 01:51:03.520]  He promises.
[01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:05.520]  So you see Trump supporting Jared Kushner.
[01:51:05.520 --> 01:51:07.520]  Trump could be completely wrong about this
[01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:08.520]  and here's the thing.
[01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:11.520]  We're about to find out real quick.
[01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:15.520]  Congress is in session.
[01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:18.520]  Progressive squad member claims McCarthy's speakership
[01:51:18.520 --> 01:51:23.520]  is a deal with far-right insurrectionists.
[01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:25.520]  See, they're really, really, really, really upset.
[01:51:25.520 --> 01:51:27.520]  Rhino Crenshaw apologizes for calling
[01:51:27.520 --> 01:51:30.520]  GOP colleagues terrorists.
[01:51:30.520 --> 01:51:33.520]  Sex trafficking, fight, help, fuel,
[01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:35.520]  gait this hatred of McCarthy.
[01:51:35.520 --> 01:51:37.520]  Yeah, McCarthy didn't support him during all of that.
[01:51:37.520 --> 01:51:39.520]  That was totally made up.
[01:51:39.520 --> 01:51:41.520]  Absolutely.
[01:51:41.520 --> 01:51:43.520]  The Mossad operation has now turned out.
[01:51:43.520 --> 01:51:45.520]  Kevin McCarthy agreed to cut
[01:51:45.520 --> 01:51:47.520]  AD Ukraine to secure its speakership
[01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:49.520]  in FullWars.com.
[01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:51.520]  And it goes on.
[01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:53.520]  It goes on from there.
[01:51:53.520 --> 01:51:58.520]  Now, let me talk about this next huge subject.
[01:51:58.520 --> 01:52:03.520]  Bolsonaro won in every state
[01:52:03.520 --> 01:52:06.520]  but the biggest city in Brazil,
[01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:08.520]  the communist control.
[01:52:08.520 --> 01:52:10.520]  Poll showed he was 50-50 there,
[01:52:10.520 --> 01:52:12.520]  but he lost by almost 70 percent
[01:52:12.520 --> 01:52:14.520]  just like they do in Maricopa County
[01:52:14.520 --> 01:52:16.520]  and other key areas like Atlanta and Georgia
[01:52:16.520 --> 01:52:19.520]  where they still their elections.
[01:52:19.520 --> 01:52:21.520]  And you have the State Department,
[01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:23.520]  the deep state down there admittedly manipulating things.
[01:52:23.520 --> 01:52:26.520]  You have Big Tech censoring Bolsonaro,
[01:52:26.520 --> 01:52:29.520]  which is another form of election meddling
[01:52:29.520 --> 01:52:31.520]  and voter suppression,
[01:52:31.520 --> 01:52:33.520]  which we now know they did the last two elections here.
[01:52:33.520 --> 01:52:36.520]  So Bolsonaro won, we know that.
[01:52:36.520 --> 01:52:38.520]  They get Lula the communist out of prison.
[01:52:38.520 --> 01:52:41.520]  They bring him back.
[01:52:41.520 --> 01:52:43.520]  The military says they're not going to stand by
[01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:47.520]  and see what's happened to their constitution.
[01:52:47.520 --> 01:52:50.520]  But now, you have millions of people
[01:52:50.520 --> 01:52:52.520]  show up in the capital city.
[01:52:52.520 --> 01:52:54.520]  They're calling it the Brazilian January 6th
[01:52:54.520 --> 01:52:57.520]  insurrection Brazil, protest or storm Congress,
[01:52:57.520 --> 01:52:59.520]  breach presidential palace photos,
[01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:01.520]  thousands rampage,
[01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:04.520]  make America a great copy.
[01:53:04.520 --> 01:53:09.520]  So as soon as Bolsonaro's out
[01:53:09.520 --> 01:53:11.520]  and as soon as the military and police
[01:53:11.520 --> 01:53:13.520]  are under the control of the communists,
[01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:16.520]  then a big crowd of millions shows up to protest
[01:53:16.520 --> 01:53:19.520]  as they did dozens of times in Bolsonaro
[01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:22.520]  and magically a few thousand people
[01:53:22.520 --> 01:53:25.520]  in yellow and green t-shirts march up to the capital
[01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:27.520]  and to the president's palace
[01:53:27.520 --> 01:53:29.520]  and there's literally in these videos
[01:53:29.520 --> 01:53:33.520]  like 15 cops lined up 20, 30 feet apart
[01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:35.520]  and they don't even block them.
[01:53:35.520 --> 01:53:38.520]  They shoot a few tear gas thing here at the crowd
[01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:40.520]  so they go ahead and storm the buildings
[01:53:40.520 --> 01:53:43.520]  and now you've got a legitimate reason they're going to claim
[01:53:43.520 --> 01:53:46.520]  to have mass trials and arrest and to go after everybody.
[01:53:46.520 --> 01:53:49.520]  And a few thousand people went into the capital,
[01:53:49.520 --> 01:53:51.520]  went into the president's mansion,
[01:53:51.520 --> 01:53:53.520]  went into their White House
[01:53:53.520 --> 01:53:57.520]  and overturned chairs and knocked holes in the walls.
[01:53:57.520 --> 01:54:00.520]  So out of millions of people outside
[01:54:00.520 --> 01:54:04.520]  peacefully pointing out they didn't buy what was happening,
[01:54:04.520 --> 01:54:05.520]  you've now had a group of people,
[01:54:05.520 --> 01:54:07.520]  probably most of them communists,
[01:54:07.520 --> 01:54:10.520]  working for Lula, go in.
[01:54:10.520 --> 01:54:13.520]  And we've seen January 6th repeated 2.0.
[01:54:13.520 --> 01:54:16.520]  And hey, Ray Epps didn't want to lie under oath.
[01:54:16.520 --> 01:54:19.520]  They released it two weeks ago.
[01:54:19.520 --> 01:54:23.520]  He said, I orchestrated breaking into the capital.
[01:54:23.520 --> 01:54:25.520]  I orchestrated going up there.
[01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:31.520]  I orchestrated it.
[01:54:31.520 --> 01:54:32.520]  Other folks were saying,
[01:54:32.520 --> 01:54:34.520]  Brazilians are acting in a movement of civil disobedience
[01:54:34.520 --> 01:54:36.520]  to protect our country against the abuse of power,
[01:54:36.520 --> 01:54:38.520]  systematic corruption, dictatorship,
[01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:41.520]  implemented by Lula and Silva
[01:54:41.520 --> 01:54:45.520]  and the 37 corrupt ministers in proper communist gang.
[01:54:45.520 --> 01:54:46.520]  And that's true.
[01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:49.520]  And when people would overthrow communist regimes
[01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:50.520]  or authoritarian regimes,
[01:54:50.520 --> 01:54:52.520]  our media would say they were heroes
[01:54:52.520 --> 01:54:54.520]  and it was beautiful they were storming
[01:54:54.520 --> 01:54:57.520]  the French Revolution and storming the Bastille.
[01:54:57.520 --> 01:54:58.520]  But the danger is,
[01:54:58.520 --> 01:55:02.520]  what do you get out of one of these revolutions?
[01:55:02.520 --> 01:55:06.520]  And who's manipulating that revolution?
[01:55:06.520 --> 01:55:08.520]  In fact, we could cut between those images
[01:55:08.520 --> 01:55:10.520]  you were just showing five seconds ago,
[01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:15.520]  of thousands streaming in
[01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:18.520]  to the capital complex
[01:55:18.520 --> 01:55:23.520]  in their big city of Brasilia
[01:55:23.520 --> 01:55:25.520]  and where are the police?
[01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:26.520]  Where are the military?
[01:55:26.520 --> 01:55:28.520]  They were there by the tens of thousands
[01:55:28.520 --> 01:55:30.520]  to walk people going in
[01:55:30.520 --> 01:55:32.520]  in the last two months during the contest election.
[01:55:32.520 --> 01:55:34.520]  But now magically, because Lula's in,
[01:55:34.520 --> 01:55:38.520]  he's illegitimate, the country's awake to him.
[01:55:38.520 --> 01:55:42.520]  They know what's going on.
[01:55:42.520 --> 01:55:44.520]  The State Department's running this
[01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:49.520]  and how much money do you want to bet
[01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:54.520]  on 90% of the people that breach the police
[01:55:54.520 --> 01:55:55.520]  and broke into a building?
[01:55:55.520 --> 01:55:57.520]  Because you don't take the government over
[01:55:57.520 --> 01:55:59.520]  in an assembly where the government meets.
[01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:01.520]  The military's an underground basis.
[01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:03.520]  The military is controlling satellites.
[01:56:03.520 --> 01:56:07.520]  The government is in underground facilities.
[01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:10.520]  It's the infrastructure, it's the media.
[01:56:10.520 --> 01:56:13.520]  I'm not saying do this, I'm saying hypothetically,
[01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:15.520]  if those were real insurrectionists taking over,
[01:56:15.520 --> 01:56:17.520]  they'd get in groups of a thousand,
[01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:19.520]  they'd get armed, they'd all go take over
[01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:22.520]  the national media and the key TV and radio stations,
[01:56:22.520 --> 01:56:24.520]  and they'd be in control of that country
[01:56:24.520 --> 01:56:27.520]  because Lula's unpopular and Bolsonaro's popular.
[01:56:27.520 --> 01:56:29.520]  And the military knew how to do that.
[01:56:29.520 --> 01:56:31.520]  They could've seized the media.
[01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:33.520]  They could've seized the control of the infrastructure.
[01:56:33.520 --> 01:56:35.520]  They could've blocked the main roads, but they didn't.
[01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:39.520]  Instead, they stood down and provocateurs,
[01:56:39.520 --> 01:56:42.520]  once the communist government is well into power
[01:56:42.520 --> 01:56:47.520]  for seven days, let them completely take over
[01:56:47.520 --> 01:56:51.520]  the capital and the president's facility
[01:56:51.520 --> 01:56:55.520]  so they can then demonize the opposition as lawless.
[01:56:55.520 --> 01:56:59.520]  You're about to see a rerun of the whole January 6 program
[01:56:59.520 --> 01:57:01.520]  because the same people that ran January 6
[01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:03.520]  are the ones that run the UN
[01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:06.520]  and just ran the operation we saw.
[01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:08.520]  I have so many listeners.
[01:57:08.520 --> 01:57:10.520]  It's a minority, but I see on the streets,
[01:57:10.520 --> 01:57:13.520]  I read your emails, I see you call into the shows.
[01:57:13.520 --> 01:57:16.520]  You say, you're a coward. You should've taken the capital.
[01:57:16.520 --> 01:57:17.520]  You should've gone.
[01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:20.520]  The capital's a damn building where they need to vote.
[01:57:20.520 --> 01:57:21.520]  It's not the government.
[01:57:21.520 --> 01:57:23.520]  There's underground bases all around D.C.,
[01:57:23.520 --> 01:57:27.520]  SIDAR in Maryland, SIDES in Colorado, SIDES in Fort Hood,
[01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:29.520]  damn underground base here in Austin.
[01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:31.520]  That's where the government is, dumbass.
[01:57:31.520 --> 01:57:33.520]  You're gonna learn about how it works.
[01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:35.520]  You don't storm a meeting house
[01:57:35.520 --> 01:57:37.520]  and look like a bunch of idiots
[01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:40.520]  right back against an occupied government.
[01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:42.520]  You identify who the occupied government is,
[01:57:42.520 --> 01:57:44.520]  you withdraw support from it,
[01:57:44.520 --> 01:58:08.520]  and you wage siege on it non-violently.
[01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:16.520]  It's a real conundrum, but that's just where we're at.
[01:58:16.520 --> 01:58:18.520]  We'll thank all the listeners for your ongoing support.
[01:58:18.520 --> 01:58:20.520]  But if you want vitamineral fusion,
