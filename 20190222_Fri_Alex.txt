[00:00.000 --> 00:19.680]  I think that what people need to hear, this is the truth.
[00:19.680 --> 00:22.320]  I'm left hanging my head and asking why.
[00:22.320 --> 00:25.720]  You do such a disservice when you lie about things like this.
[00:25.720 --> 00:32.440]  Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make
[00:32.440 --> 00:33.920]  false accusations?
[00:33.920 --> 00:37.080]  I noticed a rope around my neck and I started screaming.
[00:37.080 --> 00:44.320]  I could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity
[00:44.320 --> 00:48.480]  to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile.
[00:48.480 --> 00:51.240]  They called me a s***.
[00:51.240 --> 00:52.680]  There's no which way you cut it.
[00:52.680 --> 00:56.800]  August police reports cause real harm.
[00:56.800 --> 01:02.280]  The fact that we have these fear mongrels, the accusations within this phony attack received
[01:02.280 --> 01:04.440]  national attention for weeks.
[01:04.440 --> 01:12.360]  If I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters
[01:12.360 --> 01:14.320]  would have supported me a lot much more.
[01:14.320 --> 01:18.600]  I'm offended by what's happened and I'm also angry.
[01:18.600 --> 01:22.080]  Just remember that mine was reported right away and look what has happened.
[01:22.080 --> 01:28.320]  This publicity stunt was a scar that Chicago didn't earn and certainly didn't deserve.
[01:28.320 --> 01:34.120]  So they get to go free and go about their life and possibly attack someone else.
[01:34.120 --> 01:40.440]  Smollett attempted to gain attention by sending a false letter that relied on racial, homophobic
[01:40.440 --> 01:41.920]  and political language.
[01:41.920 --> 01:46.800]  Do you think there's a link between the letter and the attack?
[01:46.800 --> 01:49.720]  And you did mention it to the police right away about the letter.
[01:49.720 --> 01:52.360]  And that didn't work.
[01:52.360 --> 01:59.080]  Smollett paid $3,500 to stage this attack and drag Chicago's reputation through the
[01:59.080 --> 02:00.360]  mud in the process.
[02:00.360 --> 02:04.920]  I will never be the man that this did not happen to.
[02:04.920 --> 02:06.400]  I am forever changed.
[02:06.400 --> 02:08.120]  And why?
[02:08.120 --> 02:13.200]  This stunt was orchestrated by Smollett because he was dissatisfied with his salary.
[02:13.200 --> 02:18.280]  If the attackers are never found, how will you be able to heal?
[02:18.280 --> 02:21.080]  I don't know.
[02:21.080 --> 02:26.720]  But to put the national spotlight on Chicago for something that is both egregious and untrue
[02:26.720 --> 02:28.520]  is simply shameful.
[02:28.520 --> 02:33.520]  I still want to believe with everything that has happened that there's something called
[02:33.520 --> 02:34.520]  justice.
[02:34.520 --> 02:53.160]  February 22, 2019, I'm Alex Jones, your host, and I'm very honored that you decided to jump
[02:53.160 --> 02:56.600]  through all the hoops and get past the censors to join us.
[02:56.600 --> 03:01.920]  All I ask is you continue to spread the word about infowars.com and newswars.com and the
[03:01.920 --> 03:05.480]  live feeds as well as the videos that we chop out of the broadcast.
[03:05.480 --> 03:10.520]  And post to infowars.com and you never know what's going to happen.
[03:10.520 --> 03:16.040]  I was joking around with Gavin McGinnis last week here in studio about how I liked his
[03:16.040 --> 03:24.120]  open road gray, it's actually called silver belly, open road Stetson that LBJ wore.
[03:24.120 --> 03:27.520]  And so one of the crew bought me one of these things.
[03:27.520 --> 03:32.720]  So I was wearing it around the office yesterday when I got back in and threw it across the
[03:32.720 --> 03:35.800]  room and it landed right on Owen Shroyer's head.
[03:35.800 --> 03:40.440]  But to Owen's credit, he compensated because I was about a foot off, but actually the hat
[03:40.440 --> 03:45.320]  began to boomerang right on time, so he moved back and it went on his head perfectly.
[03:45.320 --> 03:49.840]  So most of the credit goes to Owen for that incredible landing.
[03:49.840 --> 03:56.040]  I mean, it even hit right side forward, a little bit cock-eyed, but I'd still give
[03:56.040 --> 03:58.600]  it a whole in one status there.
[03:58.600 --> 04:01.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, let's have a little bit of fun.
[04:01.320 --> 04:02.320]  Let's get serious.
[04:02.320 --> 04:08.840]  I talk about things being rosetta stones or windows into things or skeleton keys.
[04:08.840 --> 04:11.320]  Means that they decode a lot for us.
[04:11.320 --> 04:14.800]  They cause the big light bulb to go off above people's heads.
[04:14.800 --> 04:23.280]  And the jussie mullet case, excuse me, smullet case is just absolutely disgusting, but absolutely
[04:23.280 --> 04:25.240]  beautiful at the same time.
[04:25.240 --> 04:33.720]  This is clearly a completely out of his mind virtue signaling power tripping scumbag who
[04:33.720 --> 04:39.280]  thinks that we're all stupid and he projects that onto us, he pulled off this cartoon caper
[04:39.280 --> 04:44.440]  that's now spectacularly blown up at the establishment space who doesn't want you questioning public
[04:44.440 --> 04:46.480]  events and tragedies.
[04:46.480 --> 04:53.240]  And now all their fake hate crimes are on trial and their attempt to silence you has
[04:53.240 --> 04:55.240]  failed.
[04:55.240 --> 04:57.240]  Yes.
[04:57.240 --> 05:24.240]  No, no, no, no, no.
[05:24.240 --> 05:33.960]  But we have developed hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy
[05:33.960 --> 05:37.680]  drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[05:37.680 --> 05:39.800]  There's nothing else like it.
[05:39.800 --> 05:40.800]  Must experience it.
[05:40.800 --> 05:45.740]  It is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use packets to mix the fruit juice
[05:45.740 --> 05:47.920]  or water, whatever you'd like.
[05:47.920 --> 05:49.280]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[05:49.280 --> 05:50.280]  It lasts 10 hours.
[05:50.280 --> 05:56.720]  So take a half pack the first time you take it because turbo force is named turbo force because it will take you into overdrive
[05:57.240 --> 05:59.240]  Turbo force and in force live calm
[06:01.480 --> 06:08.360]  Liberals now are all over the niche to the newest biggest group buying guns saying I'm preparing for civil war with the white wingers
[06:08.360 --> 06:23.640]  Thank God. You just joined us. I didn't know the second amendment is for a tremendous government
[06:38.360 --> 06:40.360]  Again
[06:49.480 --> 06:54.440]  For the people above you that are inviting you into the new world order their slaves
[06:54.840 --> 06:58.440]  They've sold out to it. They're they're blind to their towers
[06:58.440 --> 07:03.760]  You don't want to be part of them like Patrick Henry said forget you are our president go from a piece
[07:03.760 --> 07:09.680]  Crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you let your chain sit lightly upon you
[07:10.560 --> 07:14.480]  And for me give me liberty or give me death
[07:14.480 --> 07:26.080]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[07:26.080 --> 07:28.080]  Oh
[07:43.360 --> 07:45.360]  February 22nd
[07:45.360 --> 07:48.240]  2019 on this Friday global broadcast
[07:48.880 --> 07:54.240]  Feels like a Monday morning to me because I've been on quasi vacation. That's why this Saturday this sunday
[07:54.240 --> 07:58.160]  It won't just be the sunday broadcast 4 to 6 p.m. We've been doing for 11 years
[07:58.800 --> 08:04.640]  I'll be doing all sorts of special transmissions. Robert Barnes the amazing lawyer an amazing orator
[08:06.000 --> 08:10.080]  Ever seen anything like the guy you can like just talk about any subject for an hour just punch the button
[08:10.080 --> 08:13.520]  He knows everything. He's going to be doing a special broadcast with me tomorrow
[08:14.960 --> 08:16.960]  Times to be announced on that
[08:17.200 --> 08:19.200]  very powerful first
[08:19.440 --> 08:21.520]  podcast I did with man Cal Muller
[08:21.520 --> 08:27.440]  He didn't release it for about a week. We're going to be premiering that on the broadcast special broadcast
[08:28.000 --> 08:30.720]  You know, I said I haven't listened to time. Let's just list the time right now
[08:31.520 --> 08:33.920]  Let's say uh one o'clock 1 p.m.
[08:34.560 --> 08:36.560]  I'm going to come in with Barnes
[08:36.560 --> 08:42.080]  And then I don't also air that uh podcast man Cal's going to premiere that and a lot more
[08:43.280 --> 08:45.280]  Wow, where to start
[08:45.280 --> 08:47.280]  Tucker Carlson always does a great job
[08:48.240 --> 08:50.240]  But today we have a double header
[08:50.240 --> 08:52.240]  It makes me like him even more
[08:52.480 --> 08:54.480]  Because one of these libtards
[08:54.560 --> 08:56.320]  videotaped him
[08:56.320 --> 08:58.320]  From the studio they were in
[08:58.320 --> 09:00.080]  via cyberspace
[09:00.080 --> 09:02.160]  Tell them they got a f off and ending the interview
[09:03.360 --> 09:05.360]  This just shows how real Tucker Carlson is but
[09:06.400 --> 09:09.040]  The first one I want to get to gets into small it
[09:10.080 --> 09:14.560]  Because Tucker's always an a plus but when he knocks it out of the park and does a 100 we got to air it
[09:15.360 --> 09:17.440]  And so this is one of those I'm not going to air the whole piece
[09:17.440 --> 09:22.160]  It's up on info wars.com and present planet.com and news wars.com, but
[09:23.040 --> 09:25.040]  He's talking about Jeffrey
[09:25.520 --> 09:27.520]  Whatever the hell his name is Jeffrey Dahmer's uh
[09:28.240 --> 09:32.800]  Twin buddy or I don't know why Jeffrey Dahmer pops in mind, but I guess he's raping and zombifying the truth
[09:33.280 --> 09:37.040]  Uh, you know, he's going out there trying to create a destruction in the in the minds of the youth
[09:38.720 --> 09:42.320]  No, no just see small it not not not Jeffrey Dahmer small it
[09:42.320 --> 09:46.640]  But uh, this guy is the gift that just keeps on giving because
[09:49.120 --> 09:56.800]  The arrogance and the the the conscious deception and the enjoyment of lying on camera and the
[09:58.240 --> 10:03.040]  Absolute relishment that he's engaged in and the doubling down
[10:03.680 --> 10:07.840]  Is incredible and then you've got a fellow kindred spirit
[10:08.560 --> 10:10.960]  In dawn virtue signaling lemon
[10:10.960 --> 10:16.880]  And both oppressed millionaires both perched with their own, you know tv programs
[10:17.760 --> 10:22.560]  Talking about how horrible america is and how horrible their lives have been
[10:24.080 --> 10:27.920]  Of course lemon goes on to say the only problem was this wasn't scripted right
[10:28.720 --> 10:30.720]  He got some bad advice
[10:31.440 --> 10:35.120]  It wasn't executed properly and even his own leftist
[10:35.120 --> 10:41.840]  Co-hosts are just stuttering and stammering and saying no it looks like small it did something really really bad
[10:42.480 --> 10:44.880]  Small it wasn't doing this to get his pay increased
[10:45.840 --> 10:48.320]  He was doing it as a giant publicity stunt
[10:48.880 --> 10:50.880]  The pay increases a side issue
[10:51.360 --> 10:56.960]  He was just taking the the the the fantasy land of mainstream corporate entertainment television
[10:57.120 --> 11:04.400]  That's all race war and whites are the devil and everything else and projecting it into the real world and engaged in street theater
[11:04.400 --> 11:09.200]  Which he knew that the corporate media would then lap up and regurgitate back on to everyone
[11:09.840 --> 11:11.840]  Oh that better part of this is
[11:12.240 --> 11:14.240]  CNN
[11:14.880 --> 11:19.360]  All the major corporate disinfo channels they have been running around
[11:20.240 --> 11:25.120]  Saying well, thank god. We never got this wrong. It was blogs and the internet that did
[11:25.360 --> 11:31.120]  No, it was blogs and the internet that said it was as phony as a three dollar bill as a plastic banana
[11:31.920 --> 11:32.960]  as the
[11:32.960 --> 11:34.960]  black glasses that
[11:35.040 --> 11:38.720]  All those cnn hosts wear to make them look smarter. It's theater
[11:39.600 --> 11:42.560]  By people that couldn't get into hollywood. That's all it is
[11:43.520 --> 11:46.000]  And it's an intersection of those two
[11:46.560 --> 11:50.640]  It was cnn. It was msnbc. It was all the channels
[11:51.200 --> 11:56.160]  Virtue signaling about the worst thing on earth had just happened and it was all true out of the gates
[11:56.160 --> 12:01.120]  Let's just believe it when 99 percent of the hate crimes are totally fake
[12:01.120 --> 12:07.920]  But they always get small retraction in the back of the paper or to mention at the 10 o'clock news after a week of
[12:08.160 --> 12:13.280]  A cross was burned poops swastikas Jewish cemeteries attacked on and on and on
[12:14.320 --> 12:18.800]  Breaking coming up hate crimes on the rise and then tiny retraction
[12:19.200 --> 12:23.440]  99 percent of the time just like 99 percent of the mass school shooters are on prozac
[12:24.240 --> 12:28.560]  Or a drug like it. Everyone knows they're planning a school shooting. The police always stand down
[12:28.560 --> 12:36.640]  Same story over and over same mo over and over and over again. This is societal sickness
[12:38.480 --> 12:40.480]  But they're small it
[12:40.800 --> 12:43.440]  Hussie small it jesse small it whatever you call his name
[12:44.000 --> 12:46.000]  murderer of the truth small it
[12:46.000 --> 12:47.120]  trying
[12:47.120 --> 12:48.000]  to
[12:48.000 --> 12:49.040]  hoax
[12:49.040 --> 12:56.240]  division and race riots in america just like we find in the documents from 2015 that we broke in january of
[12:56.240 --> 13:00.560]  2018 13 months ago got no attention because it's so powerful
[13:01.120 --> 13:04.880]  Documents show obama was planning marshal law in maryland
[13:05.760 --> 13:08.400]  Pull it up for folks and it's pages
[13:09.360 --> 13:15.520]  Pages of secret antifa documents that a family member got us we checked the phone numbers we called we confirmed
[13:15.920 --> 13:17.920]  Alexander soros was running it
[13:17.920 --> 13:22.800]  Where they actually go to blue cities where the police are on their team. They have targeted agreed upon sites
[13:22.800 --> 13:26.960]  With starbucks and with other companies to let them bash out their windows
[13:27.040 --> 13:31.600]  If you wonder why they always bash out the starbucks always burn the trash can in front it's scripted
[13:32.240 --> 13:34.480]  To then get everyone to follow suit
[13:35.360 --> 13:43.760]  To try to quote get ethnic communities to riot they go to black communities to stage riots hoping they can manipulate blacks into rioting
[13:44.000 --> 13:46.000]  So small it is under criminal
[13:46.000 --> 13:53.920]  Investigation right now. I can tell you exclusively. It's up on info wars.com and federal law enforcement that I've talked to
[13:54.720 --> 14:01.600]  FBI investigating whether small it had accomplices in chicago who directed the staged attack including
[14:03.200 --> 14:06.560]  The folks that run empire and including the democratic party in the chicago
[14:06.960 --> 14:13.760]  Machine, namely iraq hussein obama who we already know has captained operations like this. Let's go ahead though and go to some of
[14:13.760 --> 14:16.400]  Tucker Carlson last night. Here it is
[14:19.040 --> 14:21.040]  It wasn't all four
[14:21.680 --> 14:23.680]  Thank You jesse
[14:23.840 --> 14:25.440]  Thank You jesse
[14:25.440 --> 14:28.000]  Well before he claimed that white supremacists beat him up on the street
[14:28.080 --> 14:31.360]  Most people had never heard of jesse small app and after he became a victim
[14:31.920 --> 14:39.120]  Everybody wanted to be his friend. Here's don limon over on cnn bragging about how he texts his new pal jesse every single day
[14:39.120 --> 14:45.520]  He's got jesse cell number. That's how close they are really tight. My concern is for him
[14:46.400 --> 14:48.960]  Right and for his well-being every day
[14:49.840 --> 14:53.360]  I say, I know you think i'm annoying. I can show you a text. I hit pause
[14:54.000 --> 14:58.240]  We're gonna go to break and come back, but this is the soullessness of hollywood projected on the cnn
[15:00.320 --> 15:05.840]  This is this is don limon, you know wearing a thermal underwear outfit
[15:05.840 --> 15:11.840]  So that he looks more real like look i'm real i'm wearing thermal underwear on tv
[15:13.440 --> 15:15.200]  and
[15:15.200 --> 15:17.200]  In the hdc it's thermal underwear
[15:18.320 --> 15:24.480]  And and and then he's like I just care about you. I know him. He's such a celebrity now
[15:25.440 --> 15:28.640]  Oh, uh, I care about you. How are you do?
[15:29.680 --> 15:32.560]  I just want to help you can you imagine the soulless
[15:32.560 --> 15:39.280]  Emptiness of don limon if you were stuck on a mountaintop would you want to be with that guy on a deserted island somewhere?
[15:40.240 --> 15:42.720]  This is incredible. This is amazing
[15:43.680 --> 15:47.680]  We're gonna play it again from the start when we come back because it is the most sickening
[15:49.520 --> 15:50.720]  Fappy
[15:50.720 --> 15:55.920]  Verges signaling crap i've ever seen but at least don hasn't backed off. He's defending small it
[15:55.920 --> 16:05.840]  Fully cooked ready to eat bacon. I'm talking thick meaty center cut presidential bacon savory and delicious
[16:05.920 --> 16:09.200]  I buy some I use some I store some awesome

[16:20.000 --> 16:28.720]  Life saving ready to eat bacon 10 year shelf life bacon ships free at fully cooked bacon dot com fully cooked bacon dot com
[16:29.200 --> 16:31.680]  We pledge allegiance to one flag
[16:32.320 --> 16:35.200]  And that flag is the american flag

[23:53.200 --> 23:56.400]  Well, there's no question that it comes out of the ethos
[23:57.280 --> 23:59.280]  Of celebrating your victimhood
[23:59.840 --> 24:04.320]  Projecting on to everyone else that their villains in this whole make-believe fantasy land
[24:06.320 --> 24:10.720]  So there are no rules for you all the big studies out of Canada the u.s. Australia

[24:42.400 --> 24:49.200]  That's right. They are way way more apt to steal on average six times more than likely to steal if you identify as a liberal
[24:51.200 --> 24:53.200]  They're more likely to lie
[24:54.880 --> 25:02.000]  On their entrance exams or on their bar card saying they're a Native American when they're the whitest person walking the face of the earth

[35:46.280 --> 35:53.240]  thing of your life not lemon says well too bad he didn't have good advice too bad it didn't didn't
[35:53.240 --> 35:58.840]  go the way it was supposed to his only his only failure is is that higher ups got him to do it
[35:58.840 --> 36:02.600]  i think that's what lemon is telegraphing when he made the statements that shocked everybody
[36:04.280 --> 36:09.880]  because if you don't think she and and the rest of these people stage stuff well i got a bridge
[36:09.880 --> 36:16.280]  i'm ready to sell you in brooklyn and some motion from property in arizona and a couple other cliches
[36:17.800 --> 36:21.800]  so the full video of tucker carlson going over this is up on m4s.com but let's
[36:21.800 --> 36:26.600]  let's go to it it's it's hard not to start and stop it because it's so fake it's so condescending
[36:26.600 --> 36:30.440]  it's so disgusting but really it's just best you see if yourself here it is
[36:30.440 --> 36:40.840]  and what's that all for thank you jesse thank you jesse well before he claimed that white
[36:40.840 --> 36:44.840]  supremacists beat him up on the street most people had never heard of jesse small app and after he
[36:44.840 --> 36:50.600]  became a victim everybody wanted to be his friend here's don limon over on cnn bragging about how
[36:50.600 --> 36:56.280]  he texts his new pal jesse every single day he's got jesse's cell number that's how close they are
[36:56.280 --> 37:04.920]  really tight my concern is for him right right and for his well-being every day i say i know you
[37:04.920 --> 37:10.440]  think i'm annoying i can show you a text i know you think i'm annoying you but i just want to know
[37:10.440 --> 37:15.480]  okay you're doing okay that you're okay yeah you need somebody you can talk to me because there's not
[37:15.480 --> 37:20.440]  a lot of us yeah right sometimes he responds to does he doesn't respond he says you are not annoying
[37:20.440 --> 37:27.240]  you can talk to me don limon says because there aren't a lot of us out there well here's the
[37:27.240 --> 37:32.360]  translation us means people who've been oppressed in the ways that jesse small app has been oppressed
[37:32.360 --> 37:37.240]  limon is letting you know that he's in that group too yes he's a highly paid news anchor with his
[37:37.240 --> 37:44.920]  own tv show and yet like jesse small app don limon is a holy victim so there's a mad scramble over
[37:44.920 --> 37:49.720]  who's the victim here who is the victim well there is one what small it did was not a victimless
[37:49.720 --> 37:54.440]  crime there's no such thing as that an entire group of people did get slandered by this hoax
[37:54.440 --> 37:58.680]  regular people from outside the coastal cities people with the wrong political beliefs and the
[37:58.680 --> 38:04.280]  wrong skin color smollett and his many defenders savagely attacked these people and are not apologizing
[38:04.280 --> 38:08.840]  for doing it instead they're telling you you hear this everywhere that the real losers here are the
[38:08.840 --> 38:14.760]  authentic victims of hate crimes won't be believed the next time okay that's fine but what about the
[38:14.760 --> 38:19.640]  innocent americans they just poured venom on for two weeks because it matched some bigoted
[38:19.640 --> 38:24.360]  stereotype they had about middle america what about them there's no mention of them don limon
[38:24.360 --> 38:28.920]  would very much like to keep up those attacks on those people attacking them allows him to feel
[38:28.920 --> 38:34.920]  oppressed that is why when splint was finally caught limon reacted in a very puzzling way he
[38:34.920 --> 38:39.720]  didn't seem especially concerned that his buddy had lied to further divide the country to hurt
[38:39.720 --> 38:44.600]  america which he did no that wasn't the real problem the real problem according to don limon
[38:44.600 --> 38:50.680]  is that smollett's arrest might discredit the cult of victimhood this is playing out every
[38:50.680 --> 38:59.000]  single moment yeah and cable news sean hannity is going to eat jussie smollett's lunch every single
[38:59.000 --> 39:05.320]  second tucker carlson is going to eat jussie smollett's lunch every single second yeah because
[39:05.320 --> 39:12.680]  when you tell the truth about a hate hoax you're the real hater what's the cost of this attitude so
[39:12.680 --> 39:18.280]  floridly on display to our society what does it do to us well think of it this way what would happen
[39:18.280 --> 39:23.800]  to your kids if you woke them up every morning by telling them that they were victims no matter how
[39:23.800 --> 39:27.960]  hard they worked people would always hate them just for who they are what if you did that would that
[39:27.960 --> 39:34.120]  be good parenting would it make your kids stronger happier more successful no it wouldn't and good
[39:34.120 --> 39:39.160]  parents would never do that good parents tell their tell their kids that you're an individual and you
[39:39.160 --> 39:46.520]  do anything you want as long as you're determined and focused and work hard enough but if you look at
[39:46.520 --> 39:53.960]  the weird spirit that's on these hollywood people black white doesn't matter it's it's it's a creepy
[39:53.960 --> 39:59.000]  arrested development like they're in junior high they always wear a vest with lots of little buttons
[39:59.000 --> 40:05.320]  all over it of all the groups they affiliate with and who they are and and then you you're the bad
[40:05.320 --> 40:11.480]  guy see so they have to be an authority because you're the oppressor you're the bad guy and they're
[40:11.480 --> 40:17.720]  the jail warden yeah yeah let's play some of these clips of so-called celebrities saying how
[40:17.720 --> 40:27.080]  dare you question jesse smollett this is a week ago they were still saying you don't question jesse
[40:27.080 --> 40:35.560]  smollett and that's why there needs to be a bigger criminal investigation which there is
[40:36.120 --> 40:39.560]  there needs to be a bigger criminal investigation
[40:41.560 --> 40:48.120]  because this is premeditated and you know it is and jesse smollett won't even admit he staged it
[40:48.120 --> 40:54.520]  yet so what's he get a slap on the wrist and they say he did it for money he did it for fame
[40:54.520 --> 41:01.640]  and power and to oppress whole groups that voted for somebody he didn't like they did it to dominate
[41:02.680 --> 41:09.720]  and to frame america is bad while he gets fat off the tit of america we've got a bunch of these
[41:09.720 --> 41:15.640]  compilations of hollywood and the media saying don't question smollett worshiping smollett
[41:15.640 --> 41:21.000]  so play whichever one you guys want here it is we've got some breaking news actor and musician
[41:21.000 --> 41:27.240]  jesse smollett from the hit show empire was attacked and beaten early this morning in chicago
[41:27.240 --> 41:32.120]  police are looking for two potential persons of interest in a possible hate crime against actor
[41:32.120 --> 41:38.280]  jesse smollett his attackers hurled racial and homophobic slurs two people yelled racist and
[41:38.280 --> 41:44.600]  homophobic slurs racial and homophobic slurs not only homophobic we're talking about racism we're
[41:44.600 --> 41:51.480]  talking about hate with steroids the offenders uttered this is maga country he said this maga
[41:51.480 --> 41:56.920]  country punches me right in the face they are looking for two suspects who are apparently wearing
[41:56.920 --> 42:02.680]  make america great again hats i'm disgusted by people who wear hats that say maga make america
[42:02.680 --> 42:07.000]  great again i don't like that it's being put out there in the media that this is a right possible
[42:07.000 --> 42:13.000]  yeah right i think that even solves a seed that makes people feel like well is he making this up the
[42:13.000 --> 42:20.760]  media has really cast so much doubt on his story which i find so personally offensive that a gay
[42:20.760 --> 42:27.400]  black man is targeted and then suddenly he becomes the victim of people's disbelief we have a media
[42:27.400 --> 42:32.440]  that's saying it's a debate whether or not which has happened to jesse smollett is a hate crime
[42:32.440 --> 42:37.480]  it's absurd it's coming from the president of the united states he's dog whistling every day
[42:37.480 --> 42:42.920]  senator quarry booker said the vicious attack when actor jesse was an attempted modern-day lynching
[42:42.920 --> 42:47.880]  kamala harris calling the attack an attempted modern-day lynching if his claims turn out to be
[42:47.880 --> 42:51.800]  a complete hoax it would just be all right folks we'll be right back i'm going to move into some

[47:49.480 --> 47:53.960]  gotten to that point yet and we have the inside baseball on what happened inside the courtroom
[47:53.960 --> 47:59.560]  yesterday where yours truly was brought up quite a bit but we're gonna have one of rogers or
[47:59.560 --> 48:05.160]  confederates one of his writers joining us popping in later in between all these other guests but
[48:05.160 --> 48:11.880]  let me bring up something here about the whole jussie smollett situation while we're all busy
[48:11.880 --> 48:17.880]  fighting with each other over what color we are or where we came from or what religion we are
[48:17.880 --> 48:24.600]  while we throw the free market and constitution and bill of rights out the door out the window
[48:24.600 --> 48:31.880]  flush it down the toilet throw it in the garbage can social engineers are dividing and conquering
[48:31.880 --> 48:35.880]  us and of course i'm putting out a completely known statement people are like yeah tell us
[48:35.880 --> 48:40.920]  something we don't know but while we're fighting with each other over stuff that really doesn't
[48:40.920 --> 48:48.040]  matter it's important to expose it or they'll keep doing it so the fact that they're using it to
[48:48.040 --> 48:52.200]  divide and conquer does matter but in the final equation it shouldn't matter it shouldn't be an
[48:52.200 --> 48:57.160]  issue we were going to progress according to ideas and what we stand for and what we develop and
[48:57.160 --> 49:03.400]  what we build that's how a world gets better is that we all support and promote what is better
[49:03.400 --> 49:07.480]  and we have to have a real debate about what that is and then vote with our dollars vote with our
[49:07.480 --> 49:15.400]  feet vote with our actions and that's what builds a better world the problem is is that the technocrats
[49:16.360 --> 49:22.920]  robber barons the last 150 years decided to have the end of history and the final revolution
[49:22.920 --> 49:29.800]  they use both terms and to build a world that made humans obsolete that first domesticated us
[49:29.800 --> 49:36.920]  then controlled us then reduced our attention span then reduced our fertility and finally
[49:38.040 --> 49:44.520]  implants cancer viruses in the vaccines that are time delayed to give you a good case of
[49:44.520 --> 49:51.560]  viral cancer when you retire and that's in the literature that's in the facts but don't worry
[49:51.560 --> 50:00.440]  we have nbc news out vaccine misinformation info wars researchers wary of facebook embracing of groups
[50:01.560 --> 50:09.560]  so any groups that aren't alex jones but mention info wars why even use that evil word
[50:11.160 --> 50:18.440]  you'll be taken down you'll be banned nbc news and they've got all the usual suspects the professors
[50:18.440 --> 50:23.160]  and the analysts they're all there about how dangerous jones is and his disinfo on vaccines
[50:24.920 --> 50:30.840]  and they don't give any examples there's a multi-billion dollar secret vaccine damage fund
[50:30.840 --> 50:36.040]  run by rhodros and steen's sister that makes everybody shine away their rights and sign
[50:36.040 --> 50:41.720]  into daa's about their kids dying or being brain damaged from vaccines it's a fact that it's going
[50:41.720 --> 50:46.600]  on it's a fact that everybody knows they've had bad reactions to vaccines it's a fact
[50:46.600 --> 50:50.920]  that it's on the vaccine inserts they can kill you that are the hammer or give you all these
[50:50.920 --> 50:55.880]  different disorders or give you the shingles you're taking a shot to get away from or give you the
[50:55.880 --> 51:02.680]  flu and they're saying we don't like these moms and these dads come out what happened to them or
[51:02.680 --> 51:09.640]  even showing medical reports or doctors admitting it and so once we've demonized alex jones we're
[51:09.640 --> 51:18.920]  then going to expand out to everybody else and just say you want said info wars you want said alex
[51:18.920 --> 51:26.440]  jones ladies and gentlemen of the jury we've shown you five witnesses that in the year 21
[51:30.840 --> 51:36.760]  this woman talked about alex jones at a grocery store to her neighbor and she's now sentenced to
[51:36.760 --> 51:45.000]  prison she's now sentenced from the year 2021 five years ago witnessed verbally speaking the
[51:45.640 --> 51:53.560]  for verboten one who will not be named remember wired magazine i'm red white and blue and black
[51:53.560 --> 51:59.640]  hands are grabbing me out of the dark and pulling me in i'm being i'm being disappeared i'm being
[51:59.640 --> 52:05.960]  digitally murdered and i would guess that the artist either subconsciously or consciously
[52:05.960 --> 52:10.200]  doesn't like what's happening but to get paid because a lot of people tell me they do this
[52:10.200 --> 52:14.040]  they write almost satirical articles against because they're ordered to do it and they're
[52:14.040 --> 52:19.000]  told to give anti alex jones pledges well we're going to give you your third discovery channel
[52:19.000 --> 52:26.520]  show your other shows have been big hits but you must go on the new episode and speak out
[52:26.520 --> 52:36.440]  against alex jones and say he's bad so they say go fly a kite go jump in the lake go to
[52:37.320 --> 52:42.680]  hell i will go to texas but imagine the iconography let's show it again let's put a big
[52:42.680 --> 52:48.680]  screen behind me for tv viewers i'm red white and blue and the black hands are grabbing me pulling
[52:48.680 --> 52:57.000]  me into the darkness down to that black lake of tyranny where freedom dies to wash them post
[52:57.560 --> 53:04.920]  talk so much about there's your subliminal ah the black hand dragging you into the
[53:04.920 --> 53:11.080]  laboratory pits forever only to be studied by future civilizations
[53:11.080 --> 53:19.000]  that's the message shut your mouth that message isn't to me it's a message to the readers
[53:20.120 --> 53:26.120]  shut your mouth america or a big black hand's gonna reach up out of the swamp and it's gonna
[53:26.120 --> 53:31.720]  drag you kicking and screaming down to the bottom with the crocodiles and the alligators
[53:31.720 --> 53:44.040]  and the big eels so maybe it wasn't a subversive artist no i don't think so it was a message
[53:44.040 --> 53:51.720]  america shut up you're going down and nothing's gonna stop that now world governments here
[53:52.680 --> 53:55.800]  and america's heads gonna be mounted on that wall
[53:55.800 --> 54:03.960]  oh that's period that's end of discussion that's the reality
[54:06.440 --> 54:11.480]  so some of the other news i have here we'll get to next hour the communist chinese world
[54:11.480 --> 54:17.240]  social score is already being used in venezuela surprise surprise and it's already here and
[54:17.240 --> 54:23.320]  that's what this all is is introducing you to where you don't buy or sell unless you're a good
[54:23.320 --> 54:29.000]  little globalist that's all coming up next hour oh and don't worry you go through those
[54:29.000 --> 54:33.800]  drive-through now you wonder why for the first time ever the attendants get your order right
[54:33.800 --> 54:41.080]  the first time it sounds like a human it's not it's ai and again everything's designing for a world
[54:41.080 --> 54:48.920]  without humans that's the globalist leap that's the world they're building so it's all coming up
[54:48.920 --> 54:57.000]  next hour um briefly here as you know i cannot stress enough because this is like a long war
[54:57.000 --> 55:02.840]  like it's not like a long war it is a long war and so as the war gets more intense we're here
[55:02.840 --> 55:07.160]  pointing out that you are what makes the info are possible we've held out a long time thanks to you
[55:07.720 --> 55:13.160]  thanks to your stamina your support and they think by demonizing info is everywhere you'll
[55:13.160 --> 55:17.960]  be afraid to talk about it i would use the fact we've been so demonized as an incentive to say hey
[55:17.960 --> 55:24.040]  you probably heard of info wars now it's jones well why don't you go find out why the media is so
[55:24.040 --> 55:28.840]  mad and why he's so demonized and what it is he's really covering you know i went to a caribbean
[55:29.800 --> 55:38.360]  peninsula uh for four days with my wife and children and just to get some sun and my wife
[55:38.360 --> 55:43.320]  is going up the elevator i mean she went down to the front desk to change rooms when we checked in
[55:43.320 --> 55:48.280]  because they gave us we wanted to join a room that part doesn't matter she goes down there and she's
[55:48.280 --> 55:53.560]  coming back up and there's women on the elevator with a man and they're like yes i can't believe
[55:53.560 --> 56:01.480]  he's in the hotel uh and the other woman goes isn't he in prison and the husband goes no no no
[56:01.480 --> 56:09.640]  that's the other one probably about roger stone and my wife didn't say anything to him but these
[56:09.640 --> 56:16.680]  people literally think i need to go to prison they're authoritarians and they get real mad when
[56:16.680 --> 56:21.080]  they see me with all my kids too it's like i'm supposed to be lost my kids i have my kids 90
[56:21.080 --> 56:26.280]  percent of the time so see they want the left to have these victories where they think oh

[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:59.880]  martin marcota is going to be joining us coming up in the next segment you know the global digital
[01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:06.680]  cashless society isn't coming it's here and once they've got you in that position they can
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:12.600]  socially engineer society any way they want and major governments like sweden and others
[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:17.480]  are announcing plans to get rid of cash all together by 2021 and to make everyone quote
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:24.440]  take microchips to drive a car or get on a bus that's mainstream news info wars dot com
[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:32.200]  next decade's news today and that's why they want us off air she is coming up in the next
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:38.520]  segment she has been the platformed off of chase bank she said we'll just leave chase bank
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:51.960]  we've had five of the six banks we had taken we had a a plus plus rating the highest rating you
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:59.240]  can get from this private group that rates it out of boston but the day after paypal bandis
[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:05.320]  they gave us an f rating for hate and lean was to say the lawyers have asked me not to get to this
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:10.920]  yet but this is the real lawsuit the lawsuit isn't these big corporations and these big
[01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:16.920]  tech people censoring that's bad enough it's it's big ratings agencies when you don't play ball
[01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:29.000]  and you have a perfect corporate credit score perfect perfect because we used to have the
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:33.640]  establishment try to do charge backs and put them through and then see if we'd miss them to try to
[01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:40.920]  uh degrade it's like 10 years ago i just said hey don't challenge the charge backs people want to
[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:46.840]  scam us you know whatever and or if you do it challenge them that day and we have a perfect
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:54.360]  rating because we never hit the banks with charge backs because you can do that and so for for actually
[01:02:54.360 --> 01:03:01.880]  being perfect essentially i mean you're talking as good as it gets gone when one group just goes
[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:09.080]  we say because the southern prairie law center is god like moses and then moses says alex jones bad
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:15.400]  and then rating agency says oh he'll never figure out that dumb hay seat down in texas
[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:20.040]  that we're going to put a fraudulent f rating on him he doesn't even know what our group is out of
[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:25.400]  boston he doesn't know any of this stuff he doesn't know we've got he'll he'll never get copies of
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:31.800]  our directives he'll never be high level bank heads that demand answers there won't be any memos
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:38.120]  just like the heads of the oxy cotton corporation said we're going to get people addicted in fact
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:41.880]  i didn't cover that two weeks ago i covered this years ago and warned people about it but
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:44.840]  i didn't even cover it when i was proving right again will you guys print that up for me
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:52.200]  company that owns oxy cotton said the headline was we're going to be their one-stop shop for
[01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:56.360]  getting you addicted and then we're going to have drugs to get you off of it that are almost as bad
[01:03:56.360 --> 01:04:02.840]  that kind of like heroin was invented after the civil war to replace opium addiction we
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:06.920]  got we got a lot of troops they're addicted to opium from their arms and legs sought off
[01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:13.320]  and they're addicted to opium what do we do well we invented a thing you know it's 20 30 40 times
[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:18.760]  stronger than the average opium it's called heroin and it'll sure as you won't want opium anymore
[01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:23.800]  after you have this like you got a problem starting cocaine try something called crack it'll fix it
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:30.360]  the same deal so that's the new thing is you just got rating agencies
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:37.480]  where they just say hey we're gonna say you're an evil person well we're gonna sue your ass off
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:46.600]  bitch so get ready for that but i need capital to do it stay with us info wars.com news wars.com

[01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:19.240]  i'm just an average man with an average life i work from nine to five hell i pay the price
[01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:25.560]  all i want is to be loved alone in my average home but we're going to i always feel like i'm in
[01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:33.000]  the twilight soon and i always feel like somebody's watching me and i love the price
[01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:41.880]  i always feel like somebody's watching me well martina marco is a fellow thought criminal
[01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:49.880]  she's been on the show before very smart lady also very lovely and she's a talented dancer uh and
[01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:56.120]  exhibitionist and she is also again somebody that has to be silenced she understands something
[01:06:56.120 --> 01:07:02.120]  ladies and gentlemen a global corporate system is testing a planetary social credit score
[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:08.760]  which is basically digital minders digital spy systems digital control where if you don't play
[01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:15.640]  ball in cyberspace or in the real world you then get demonized and then you start getting unpersoned
[01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:24.600]  and i have the articles uh right here in my stack today china bans millions from frights trains in
[01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:30.600]  social credit crackdown that's a big zero hedge article and it links directly to the communist
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:35.880]  chinese newspapers who are very very proud of this now in my film in game blueprint for global
[01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:42.760]  enslavement i said in the near future if you haven't played ball with the globalist and you
[01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:47.080]  haven't done what they want socially they will not let you buy or sell i didn't get that from the
[01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:50.920]  bible i got it from their own statements but it is interesting that the bible is coming true
[01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:56.040]  it's either real or they're building it which makes it real so either way it's still real
[01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:02.680]  it's incredible so this is the big threat to everyone banks not letting you bank
[01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:12.680]  if you sell hunting supplies at your hardware store or the nra and and the fact that people
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:20.600]  aren't organizing against this is absolutely incredible so i want to go to our guests and i
[01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:25.640]  want to ask her martina to tell folks a little bit about yourself because if i tell it it won't be
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:31.480]  as good as if you tell it and i think your main crime is you've been successful you've reached
[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:36.440]  hundreds of millions of people you have millions of fans and so it's because you're effective
[01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:42.600]  at exposing this corrupt system that you're now being unpersoned people say well just go get another
[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:47.560]  bank account oh no this means they've put in hate rating and when i file suit you're you're going to
[01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:52.520]  need to you know obviously join our class action suit they've put a hate rating in there that has
[01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:58.360]  nothing to do with your real activity and so they have implemented the chinese style control grid on
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:03.000]  you by stealth so you are definitely a victim of this not that you want to be a victim we're not in
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.760]  the victim class here but it's because we're not in the victim class they want to make us victims
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:13.160]  so so thank you for joining us yeah thanks for having me yeah and i mean it's definitely um i was
[01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:18.920]  a performer in new york city and they were not happy that i was a trump supporter and a conservative
[01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:24.680]  in general so they blacklisted me kicked me out of the scene and they really went after my income
[01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:29.160]  that way extremely extremely hard so i had to move on and figure out what else am i going to do with
[01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:35.640]  my career and the only thing since my reputation was tarnished was to get involved in media and
[01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:41.000]  expose this stuff and and just stick up for our side so i've been doing that so them trying to ruin
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:46.920]  my life didn't work as as well as they planned so um i actually have a business account with chase
[01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:54.280]  i've had it for eight years it's an llc and um so i talk about arts and culture because you
[01:09:54.280 --> 01:10:00.360]  know how important that is politics is downstream form uh culture and um there's something called
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:05.720]  comics gate which is pretty much gamergate but in the comics industry so there's a lot of people
[01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:13.160]  that went away from dc and marvel's extreme sjw left-wing propaganda with their failing comics
[01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:17.880]  and a lot of these people were independent and they started going on indiegogo and creating
[01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:24.280]  independent comics and doing it incredibly well they have uh went head to head with dc and marvel
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:30.040]  and they made like two million dollars this since this past summer uh cumulatively all together so
[01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:36.680]  i wanted to keep pursuing my performing kind of persona lady alchemy so i did a comic book uh
[01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:44.360]  with these comic skaters and um dare you yeah and so that my chase business account is linked
[01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:51.000]  with that indiegogo and we did incredibly well we're so far over 34 000 wow trying to raise money
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:57.880]  trying to publish books out on america so when i got the letter that my um business account is
[01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:03.480]  being closed down i was really freaked out because i said this is my one thing that i have they tried
[01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:08.440]  to get rid of me and every single way possible run me out of new york city ruin them all my career
[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:13.720]  opportunities so now i have this new opportunity amongst a group of the comic skaters that you
[01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:17.160]  know are doing incredibly well so that it's it's a really interesting thing because you know the
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:22.440]  left keep trying to tear us down but the one industry ironically that we are kicking butt in
[01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:28.360]  is the arts it's the comic book industry so we're doing really really well they aren't the liberals
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:33.320]  they're not creative they always pose as if they're the real liberals and they control art because
[01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:38.280]  they're the opposite of a real liberal they're leftist control freaks who destroy civilization so
[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:42.280]  that's why they always want to be in charge of the arts and in charge of speech is because they
[01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:47.800]  don't have a talent yeah and i think that they're really afraid because this comic skater is doing
[01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:53.480]  so well um they they really try to shut us down all the time they keep going after a lot of the
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:58.680]  big independent creators trying to shut them down um you know go after them and they've been fighting
[01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:03.000]  it they actually one of them did a tortuous interference so when you go after them legally
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:08.200]  that shows them they can't do this you know so that's a really good method of going after someone
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:12.600]  that's trying to mess with your contracts and mess with you professionally and so when i got this
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:17.320]  letter i was really really upset because it's tied to my comic book and what we're doing with
[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:23.400]  comic skate and it could essentially it could have shut it all down but luckily indigo goes working
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:27.800]  with me but yeah so it's bigger than just oh get another bank i mean i think they were really
[01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:33.720]  targeting me because we're doing something here you know we're kicking ass in the arts and i didn't
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:38.920]  think i wasn't sure if it was political so i got the letter and i said how could this be you know i
[01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:44.440]  it's all legal activity i've i don't have any criminal record everything is up to par i've
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:50.280]  had this account for eight years why is this happening and so i called them and uh they wouldn't
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:54.200]  tell me why they said that they have the right to if you see the letter it says
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:59.960]  we're ending our relationship with you and i was like okay my bank is breaking up with me
[01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:03.720]  well i'll tell you the problem let's go back up at the top anything they target is what they can
[01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:08.280]  track virally is already number one or it's going to be number one like i'm the number one on all
[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:11.960]  these different platforms so they banned me number one on the app store right when our
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:15.960]  news app launched a month before the band and and let's go back to the comic book let's go to that
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:23.000]  top one that looks like world-class art you look powerful you also look sexy you've got a sword in
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.360]  your hand this is everything the left is afraid of because i would even call you a right-winger
[01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:31.000]  left-winger you're just a pro-freedom person they're scared of that this is what would actually
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:36.280]  target their demographic but but with freedom so that's this is a badge of honor that they're
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:43.960]  coming after you because what you're doing is obviously powerful yeah and um i after that
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:48.840]  happened to me and i posted about it i started noticing that the proud boy guy had his chase bank
[01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:53.800]  it was chase and i had the same letter as me then i noticed joe bigs and i started noticing all
[01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:59.080]  these other stories of chase targeting people that were in my scene people i knew and so that
[01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:03.560]  was when i said okay there's something more to this but they refused to tell me exactly why they
[01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:09.400]  said that they reserve the right to uh get rid end our relationship and not tell me why and i think
[01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:16.600]  it's a reputational risk well isn't that a kafka s situation uh is that they won't even tell you
[01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:18.760]  the thought crowd you've committed well let me tell you what's happened because we got the
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:22.360]  secret documents and this is gonna be coming out sooner than lost it i'm gonna give the enemy a
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:28.280]  heads up um it's it's very simple you get listed by the southern property law center anybody else
[01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:34.680]  they then in this secret banking cartel uh it's tied in the inner pole you name it they put an
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:39.080]  eight symbol in your file you don't get told about it you don't know it's a secret blacklist
[01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:44.280]  with the banks and then it's going to move on to i'm sure you've heard about uber banning people
[01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:50.840]  these different air bnb groups banning people yeah that happens to me that happens to me in
[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:56.520]  dc too actually my uber just stopped working at one point yeah that's it and so that they've got a
[01:14:56.520 --> 01:15:02.440]  database of the chinese socials credit score that they go put a fraudulent like conviction on your
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:08.360]  record a secret court a secret file a secret database out of boston they go put it on the
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:14.280]  file and then now other groups are joining it it's it's it's like infraguard it's it's part of the
[01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:20.040]  fbi and then as other groups join it sure there's secret lists for al-qaeda or isis it's the same
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:26.360]  thing you've been put on an isis list i believe it i truly truly believe it and i didn't want to get
[01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:30.840]  into that and i didn't want to assume and go oh it's because i'm a free thinker that this is
[01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:36.520]  happening but um the evidence is really starting to show that uh they're really targeting us and uh
[01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:40.600]  it's really scary because going after your bank account going after your business is serious well
[01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:46.600]  this is the good news it's so criminal they keep it secret it's not going to be secret much longer
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:50.680]  you understand i've got more lawyers flying in today we're going to decide when and how
[01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:53.800]  but i'm giving the enemy heads up when we're getting all the witnesses all the documents we

[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:49.480]  by the fbi for higher ups directing him in the democratic party as well as the people controlling
[01:20:49.480 --> 01:20:54.120]  the hit show empire it'd be an even bigger hit if the hoax would have been carried out
[01:20:54.120 --> 01:21:01.320]  but it was too obvious too childish and too well documented but imagine if he'd been successful
[01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:07.000]  now everyone with a red hat every white person we're all heartable race criminals who deserve

[01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:37.560]  going to go back to our guests i want to ask her to ride shotgun into the next segment if she can't
[01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:40.920]  with faith golding because they're both going with the same crap because they're smart good-looking
[01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:45.000]  women that scares the hell out of leftist they want a bunch of victims they control uh with a
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:49.080]  bunch of chicken neck weird feminist dominating them making sure they're miserable as possible
[01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:53.480]  uh and not using their feminine power but let's go right back uh just real quick to
[01:21:53.480 --> 01:22:02.120]  small it in all of his fake garbage here it is let's um i was talking to a friend and i said i
[01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:07.800]  just wanted to find them and she said it's sweetie they're not going to find them and i just made
[01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:14.440]  me so angry because i'm just going to be left here with this you know what i'm saying like i'm
[01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:25.960]  just going to be left here with with like so they get to go free and go about their life
[01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:30.280]  and possibly attack someone else and i'm here to left with that left with the aftermath of this
[01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:39.240]  that's not cool to me that's not okay so i understand how difficult it will be
[01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:47.400]  to find them but we gotta i still want to believe with everything that has happened
[01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:52.520]  that there's something called justice because if i stop believing that
[01:22:55.160 --> 01:23:01.720]  then what's it all for beautiful thank you jesse thank you thank you beautiful thank you jesse
[01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:04.600]  oh my god jesse this is so hot right now
[01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:11.240]  meanwhile the un openly funded with obama the murder of hundreds of thousands in the
[01:23:11.240 --> 01:23:15.000]  arab spring tens of thousands of women and children in sex slavery you got a malin all
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:19.160]  right on tv saying 500 000 kids are a good price to pay for quote security in the gulf
[01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:25.240]  there's no thank you jesse to that so going back to our guest uh who has been basically
[01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:31.480]  unpersoned off of her bank account martina marcota who's at twitter for now on instagram
[01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:39.800]  at martina marcota m a r k o t a and martina marcota dot com again you're involved in hit
[01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:43.720]  comic books that's your real crime because most people don't get their news even from comedy
[01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:49.080]  central anymore they get it from the comic books you're breaking into verboten our typal joseph
[01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:56.040]  cambell uh type symbolism and alchemy and that's really your crime isn't it yeah yeah i'm actually
[01:23:56.040 --> 01:24:01.720]  also in a trump space force i think you know timothy liman and then so uh check out check out
[01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:09.640]  that but uh yeah no my book has uh the occult symbolism of the elite and my character is like
[01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:15.080]  she becomes redpilled and discovers the hidden influences of media and advertising
[01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:21.560]  that's saturated in cities and stuff like that and so it's about exposing that sort of thing and
[01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:28.040]  um you know i think it's super fun it's it's not very much like leftist art where they
[01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:34.280]  go out of their way to make sure you see their sjw agenda it's just fun for anyone to watch
[01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:41.720]  but i am kind of secretly hiddenly exposing some things and again it's the delivery system
[01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:46.680]  i really hate so so so where do you go from here because obviously we'll need to talk soon
[01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:50.600]  because we are going to have to follow suit against these folks i mean this is a big national
[01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:54.760]  criminal operation think about what the public learns that there's a secret database and they're
[01:24:54.760 --> 01:25:01.160]  preparing to put all conservatives on it yeah i truly believe that and i cannot believe that that
[01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:06.280]  is really something that where we're at today i mean i remember watching you many many years ago
[01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:10.520]  talking about this sort of stuff when you had billy corrigan on i've always liked you know the
[01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:17.240]  arts and stuff and and watching you so uh it you were saying stuff about this years ago like 10
[01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:23.000]  years ago and here we are today and it's it's not even a conspiracy it's just real life i mean it's
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:28.600]  happening to me now and um i don't know uh we definitely have to do something i have to switch
[01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:34.120]  my bank accounts and transfer tens of thousands of dollars and make sure indy gogo has is updated
[01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:38.760]  with my new bank account so they've given me that little extra burden to do so yes of course i can
[01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:45.000]  change banks um but ultimately people were saying there's some sort of law like there's
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:49.720]  some sort of association with the government that chase has so this actually can be it is
[01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:54.360]  illegal it's not like there's like a private listen the database when there's no law to create a
[01:25:54.360 --> 01:26:01.080]  designation that's just random put on your account to say you're a bad person and then to put on your
[01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:06.520]  credit uh that you're a bad person i mean that's broad is i mean that's defamation what that is
[01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:11.640]  is an attempt to tortiously interfere and ruin your life uh because listen i'm sure you've you
[01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:15.960]  asked how did you get targeted you know about sleeping giants and and all these other groups
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:20.600]  the left goes around brigading and so they've already they think knocked me into the ground so
[01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:26.280]  now nbc reports anyone's just saying info wars are alex shones is next that's nbc news anyone
[01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:30.840]  criticizing vaccines like hey my daughter got killed from her you know my i went blind from her
[01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:34.920]  look the insert says it can kill you that's all going to be banned it's just basically everything
[01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:39.640]  and so the media's new job these journalists aren't really journals anymore they organize
[01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:45.240]  brigades of leftist to make millions of phone calls and emails to target each person so they also
[01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:50.520]  harass companies till they do this yeah i mean i've seen that in my performing professional career
[01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:55.160]  then brigade and do that but i think that um i have an association with gavin you know people
[01:26:55.160 --> 01:27:01.240]  associate me with being on gavin show and stuff like that so i think that's probably why my account
[01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:05.000]  was oh exactly because they're really scared of proud boys why do you think they're so scared of
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:09.720]  proud boys you would dare go on the founder show i mean guys that stand up to people that beat up women
[01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:15.160]  and children and and defensively defend women and children there's nothing worse is there no i mean
[01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:20.120]  trying to uh venerate the housewife and just have a simple like little men's club i mean what's wrong
[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:26.040]  with that you can't have a men's club nowadays it's insane but yeah i'm associated to him and so now
[01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:29.960]  everyone just constantly they've been doing it in the comic escape too they they've been targeting
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:35.720]  and saying she's a proud boy even though i'm a woman um and trying to say that that's reason
[01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:40.520]  why i'm some sort of nazi or white supremacist or something well i mean you're not anti-male
[01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:48.280]  and so that's why you're back yeah yeah no i you know i support men for being men and uh
[01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:54.520]  i have a totally different duty as as a woman and uh i that's what i portray in the comic
[01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:58.360]  books as well that's what's been going on in this scene is that i don't know if you've noticed but
[01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:03.240]  they've been trying to defeminize women in the comic book industry and let's talk about that
[01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:07.400]  we come back start getting into that they want to take the real power from women and create these
[01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:12.200]  sexless blobs and and why is that because they don't want men being powerful men they don't want
[01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:18.600]  women being powerful they don't want us in our powerful roles yeah it's just one big hodgepodge
[01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:25.240]  of uh non non-gendered things and they get very angry about it in the comics industry
[01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:29.480]  they don't want women to be feminine and i think that's the most anti-feminist thing i can think of
[01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:34.200]  well my wife walked out of the house today in a black trench coat in black high heel boots
[01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:38.600]  and i thought i was gonna fall over i mean she knows about the feminine and just uh is dripping
[01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:43.160]  with it and i just can't believe that they've convinced women to turn that powerless we'll be

[01:33:03.960 --> 01:33:07.240]  oh
[01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:26.520]  um
[01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:49.640]  Well we got so much to talk about here. Faith Goldy ran for mayor. She was in third place
[01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:53.400]  out of 30-something people going towards number one. They banned her advertising on the internet,
[01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:58.560]  on radio, on TV. They've been taking her off the internet everywhere. We have Martina
[01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:05.240]  Markota as well and she is an artist and performer and writer and comic book author and a bunch
[01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:09.000]  of other successful things. She's been on the show before. She also goes out as a journalist and
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:14.000]  covers the insanity of the leftist here in the U.S. and also in Europe. And so I want to get Faith
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:18.240]  Goldy back on because she recently got married and has been out of commission but she's back to
[01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:22.460]  talk about what's going on in Canada. But meanwhile they've got nationwide gun compensation about
[01:34:22.460 --> 01:34:27.120]  to be announced. We've got people running around about national gun compensation here and we've
[01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:31.000]  got all this censorship happening but people are fighting back with the yellow vest. What is
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:37.520]  the state of the world you just traveled Europe, Faith Goldy? Well I'd say that the regular guy
[01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:45.560]  rebellion is in full swing and that Canada has not been spared. As you mentioned Alex, just in
[01:34:45.560 --> 01:34:54.800]  that our Justin Trudeau is about to announce what sounds like a nationwide handgun ban. They've
[01:34:54.800 --> 01:35:02.520]  paraded around all the victims from various terrorist attacks who are now saying that law
[01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:08.320]  biting gun owners are somehow to blame for the firearms that were used, the illegal firearms
[01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:13.800]  that were used. And of course Alex, as you covered dozens, if not hundreds, if not thousands of
[01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:20.520]  times on your program, we all know what this means. We've read this textbook in history before. We
[01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:27.000]  know that gun confiscation eventually leads essentially to an open playing field for the
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:31.360]  tyrant. And what's so interesting about this, and I would say a word to the wise for you Yank,
[01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:36.720]  so to speak, as south of the 49th, is this. The guns that they're coming after here in Canada,
[01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:43.960]  they're called restricted firearms, i.e. they are on a registration, a registry. And Alex,
[01:35:43.960 --> 01:35:51.000]  time and time again, folks within the pro gun pro to a community say that registration leads to
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:57.280]  confiscation and Canada right now is standing on the brink with this gun grabbing tyrannical,
[01:35:57.280 --> 01:36:04.480]  far left so-called post national government. Any day now due to release a report, the priming,
[01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:08.600]  the populace right now, but getting the victims out there saying we want a nationwide handgun
[01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:14.160]  ban, telling us the report is about to come out. And they're saying that action thereafter might
[01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:19.000]  be imminent. Well, let's not forget when Trump declared an international emergency that's
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:23.680]  constitutional for the border, the Democrats both Pelosi and Nadler said, well, we'll use
[01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:30.760]  an emergency to take your guns. In fact, here's a clip of Nadler just last Friday. If the president
[01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:36.280]  can declare an emergency today on this nonce on this, the democratic president can decide that
[01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:42.240]  the, as you mentioned, the gun crime, the 40,000 people a year killed in this country is a crisis.
[01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:46.280]  And why don't we take everybody's guns away or force everybody to register their guns or ban all
[01:36:46.280 --> 01:36:52.000]  assault rifles or do all of that. Martina Marcota riding shotgun with us here with Faith Goldie.
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:57.920]  And again, your website's martinamarcota.com. Faith Goldie sites, faithfortoronto.ca and
[01:36:57.920 --> 01:37:01.480]  that Twitter is Faith Goldie. It's important to go to their sites themselves, folks, that's where
[01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:06.400]  you have to go now to actually get to people because everything's being massively censored. Your
[01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:10.520]  take on this, why do you think, I'm going to ask Goldie this, why do you think the left's gone
[01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:14.440]  from denying they want the guns, admitting it, denying they want to sexualized children admit
[01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:17.600]  now admitting it, denying they want to destroy the family now admitting it. I want to ask you
[01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:22.440]  both what you brought up for the break. Why are they so afraid of powerful, smart, good-looking,
[01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:28.280]  feminine women? Because they're jealous of it. But I want to get your, your take on first the
[01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:34.640]  guns. Why do you think the left things show out in the open now? Well, I mean, I think that they
[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:40.640]  can do that now. This is what they've always thought, but they have to do it slowly, you know,
[01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:46.960]  they start slow and then now they're at the point where they can do those things. And it's,
[01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:51.680]  it's just obvious. That's what I think. That's it. I mean, that's it. They're making their move. They
[01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:57.000]  think it's time to do it. Faith, what do you think? That Martina is completely right. And hi,
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:03.240]  Martina. Nice to see you here in 2D. Well, you know, look, this is what we talk about all the
[01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:08.200]  time, the over 10 window, you know, it needs to be shifted in order to move around the perimeters,
[01:38:08.200 --> 01:38:14.480]  so to speak, of what we deem as acceptable within society. I remember before, for instance, the New
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:20.480]  York legislation about abortion, I'm pro-lifer, I'm unabashed about that, saying they don't care
[01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:24.240]  about term limits. They don't, they know what they're doing. They don't think this is a clump
[01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:28.720]  of cells. They know that they're out here killing babies. These people are spawns of Satan. And
[01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:35.240]  sure enough, now they've come out into full force because the populace have become so deprogrammed
[01:38:35.240 --> 01:38:42.080]  from reality and programmed into a complete vortex of untruths and lies that we're, to hear more
[01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:49.840]  lies, to hear complete evil, to hear complete, essentially, advocacy for murder no longer shocks
[01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:54.400]  us, as it would have, frankly, our forefathers. And the exact same thing is happening right now
[01:38:54.400 --> 01:39:00.400]  with firearms. Alex, it's just a registry. It's just a registry. It's just to make sure that we
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:05.120]  can keep track of where all the big, bad, scary guns are. And then now I'm reading, I'm reading the
[01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:10.800]  Toronto paper. I'm reading the national paper. I'm reading economists. It's like, yeah, gun
[01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:15.360]  confiscation to begin. We just showed the headline for TV viewers. They're actually saying we're
[01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:19.600]  going to confiscate the guns if folks go, well, that's only Canada. No, the New York Times,
[01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:24.480]  the case for repealing the Second Amendment. And I agree with you, Faith, they're pushing the envelope.
[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:30.480]  Well, I think they started, sorry, I was just going to say that I think that they started with
[01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:36.080]  this stuff now back then, they never would have gotten anything, you know, they wouldn't have
[01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:41.920]  their way an inch. But the fact that they start slow, small, and then now they can increment
[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:45.360]  all the way up to this point. So what comes next to both of you?
[01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:52.800]  It's a scary question, Alex. You know, I wish I was wrong for what comes next.
[01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:57.680]  My answers along the way, my 10 years of reporting, journalism, commentary,
[01:39:57.680 --> 01:40:04.640]  I wish I was wrong every time I tried to warn people of what comes next. But let me tell you,
[01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:11.200]  we now have an international, both temporal and frankly, as far as I'm concerned, a spiritual war
[01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:17.600]  between good and evil. And they are now personified as the nationalists versus the globalists. And the
[01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:23.600]  globalists are damn terrified because of organizations like yourself, like where Martina is with the
[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:29.280]  Daily Caller, with the rebel media, with the democratization of data that is slowly pulling
[01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:34.080]  people from the matrix and saying, hold on a second, we've been lied to, hold on a second,
[01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:37.280]  all this do goodery that we've been saying that we've been doing for the rest of the world is
[01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:42.320]  actually having a negative effect on your family, on your community, on your country. And what happens
[01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:48.080]  when when the powerful feel threatened is that they begin to do things like censorship,
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:53.120]  like taking away those things which make us the little guy, the regular guy, frankly, the mass
[01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:58.720]  is powerful, that includes our freedom of speech, our freedom of consciousness, and indeed our right
[01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:06.160]  to defend ourselves. And in this case, it's to bear arms, if you will. So what comes after that?
[01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:12.640]  Well, if we're impotent, so to speak, to do anything about protecting our heritage, our present,
[01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:18.400]  and our children's future, well, then we are giving these guys, again, a wide open field to
[01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:20.640]  execute their will. And we've seen what their will is.
[01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:24.080]  Well, I totally agree. So, so let me ask you both this, and we'll come back for a break,
[01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:29.280]  talk more about it. If the in game is absolute tyranny, they're coming after the First Amendment,
[01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:34.960]  Second Amendment, right to bear arms all over the world. We see that almost as a negative thing.
[01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:38.400]  And it is negative they're doing it. But the fact that we've been so successful,
[01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:41.680]  how about Yellow Vest when we come back and other movements, other nationalist movements,
[01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:45.920]  the fact that we've pushed their timetable forward and made them take the velvet glove off,
[01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:51.200]  I see that as very, very positive that we've forced them into their more aggressive actual posture.
[01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:58.080]  Yeah, absolutely. But I think that we need to start doing more things like what Faith did,
[01:41:58.080 --> 01:42:05.520]  you know, is go into like do our own long march into the institutions, get into positions of
[01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:11.520]  government try, you know, get into educational institutions, start teaching people, the kids
[01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:16.160]  children and stuff. I'm involved in the arts. So we got to get back into arts and culture,
[01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:21.040]  Hollywood and all that. So if we can start infiltrating the way that they did back into
[01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:25.840]  the institutions, we can gain control again, and definitely in government, I mean, just go run for
[01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:30.160]  office, do something, do what Faith did, you know. And by the way, even though she lost,
[01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:34.800]  she was an international sensation, got bigger than she ever was,
[01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:39.440]  showed them censor her, showed all this evil, and it really illustrated what's happening.
[01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:44.320]  So if people run again and again and again, it will break their back. Resistance is victory.
[01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:48.640]  If you lay down, they win. If you keep fighting, you get stronger, they lose.
[01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:52.720]  Don't adapt to being oppressed, fight back against the oppression and defeat it.
[01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:55.840]  We're not victims. We're winners. We're victors.
[01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:12.800]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best selling supplement family in the world
[01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:18.800]  is energy drinks and energy supplements. But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and
[01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:23.600]  synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few
[01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:28.880]  hours and have terrible side effects. We have developed hands down from our research, the most
[01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:35.600]  powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout and beyond system in the world. There's nothing else
[01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:40.880]  like it. You must experience it. It is a total game changer, and it comes in easy to use,
[01:43:40.880 --> 01:43:45.360]  packets to mix it with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like. Warning though, it's very,
[01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:49.760]  very strong. It lasts 10 hours. So take a half pack at the first time you take it because turbo
[01:43:49.760 --> 01:44:18.000]  force is named turbo force because it will take you into overdrive turbo force and enforce live.com.
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:25.200]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH. What we learned
[01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:29.600]  was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:35.440]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter, and not only were the heavy
[01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:42.720]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels. As it turns out,
[01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:48.400]  the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water. So what we've learned is that volcanic
[01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:54.400]  ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply. But more importantly, a good water
[01:44:54.400 --> 01:45:00.880]  filtration system will purify it. You know, the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong
[01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:05.440]  at 45 is that I won't be there for my children someday. That's why I need to make them strong now.
[01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:11.360]  Now I can be there for my children. Now I can make them strong. Now I can instruct them. Now I can
[01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:14.960]  teach them what I've learned, but not once I'm gone. You think of this digital age, your words
[01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:18.560]  going forever, but now they're even better, getting rid of what you said they were before.
[01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:23.840]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high tech book burning,
[01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:29.280]  isn't it? But I have joined my will to the resistance. I can't be destroyed now. As long
[01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:33.920]  as I realize I've done right, and the longer the people know the truth, and you can't be destroyed
[01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:39.760]  either. As long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it and go through the fire for it,
[01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:44.640]  there is a magic that then takes place, the transcend space and time. When you commit the
[01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:50.000]  word of mouth or to pray for us or to spread our articles and videos, that overrides everything
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:55.760]  the enemy's doing. So please now commit to support InfoWars however you can and realize your provision
[01:45:55.760 --> 01:46:02.720]  to InfoWars is your own provision. At InfoWars, we're always looking for the very best, best-selling,
[01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:08.160]  highest-rated products that we can then private label and sell. Well, there is a national company
[01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:13.680]  who has FDA approval to sell their wound gel that is the strongest out there, and we private label
[01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:20.880]  it, and we sell it for $10 less online than they sell it at CBS and Walgreens. We also have another
[01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:26.560]  product also produced by the same company, Immune Gargle. We've been selling a lot of the wound
[01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:32.960]  gel and a lot of the Immune Gargle. We're going to go from full price to 40% off on both of these
[01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:39.120]  best-selling products right now at InfoWarsLive.com and InfoWarsTour.com. This is a limited time

[01:46:57.680 --> 01:47:03.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:34.320]  You know, part of my problem is that I don't see I'm too confident. It's not like I've even
[01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:40.000]  punched drunk for being in this fight so long. I just have seen so many times God pull our bacon
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:46.160]  out of the fire that I almost just get, and I want to say even lackadaisical, about we're trying to
[01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:52.560]  row the ship to shore and there's holes in it and the water's right up to the edge of the top of
[01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:56.400]  the boat. We could go under any minute, but I'm just confident we're going to make it to shore.
[01:47:56.400 --> 01:48:00.320]  Thanks to listeners and viewers' support, understanding we literally are one of the
[01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:06.960]  main beacons of truth and justice, relaunching Americana, relaunching your basic human systems
[01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:13.520]  of success, relaunching men, men, men, women, men, women, and true free open societies,
[01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:19.520]  not the authoritarianism of the globalist. That said, the only way we circumvent their
[01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:24.240]  massive censorship is you spread in the word about InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, the videos,
[01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:28.640]  the articles, the live links, and they want to inoculate everybody psychologically that InfoWars
[01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:34.160]  is so bad and so evil. So you're afraid to talk to folks. No, that's the door in, like, hey,
[01:48:34.160 --> 01:48:39.600]  you've heard about InfoWars, the wild stuff they say about it. Yeah, I have. Well, did you hear
[01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:44.560]  about this? Where George Soros said that we're in a war with China and the U.S. is going to win and
[01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:51.280]  that Trump's unbeatable. Oh, no, you didn't see that. That was a prospectus to big bankers.
[01:48:51.280 --> 01:48:56.800]  Well, InfoWars.com has his actual statement. You see, the globalists are losing and everything
[01:48:56.800 --> 01:49:01.520]  they're doing is a rearguard action. It doesn't mean we're offering some cult drink the, you know,
[01:49:01.520 --> 01:49:05.840]  vodka and barbiturates and go up to the comet in the sky and everything's gonna be perfect.
[01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:09.840]  But this current group of globalists, their system is falling apart.
[01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:15.760]  So bottom line, folks, we make it easy to support the broadcast. We have the best turmeric. If you
[01:49:15.760 --> 01:49:20.960]  don't know what turmeric does for inflammation, your body, your health, the great antioxidant,
[01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:26.720]  it's the best thing out there. We have 95% of humanoid at a price of people that sell it.
[01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:32.480]  5% of humanoid. So bodies is amazing. Our protein bar is a high-end protein bar discounted for $3
[01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:38.880]  apiece. They sell it for $6, $7 in Whole Foods. Ours is $3 the regular price. It's $240 on discount
[01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:42.960]  right now. It's an amazing, high-quality protein bar. So they probably call it snake bars. You know,
[01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:48.320]  he sells coffee. He's evil. He sells toothpaste. He's evil. It's all snake bars, snake bars.
[01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:52.800]  And Jones selling things is evil. He's trying to make money. Of course, I am in a total war.
[01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:56.880]  Most revolutionaries have to rob banks and kidnap people for money. I don't do that.
[01:49:57.440 --> 01:50:04.800]  So m4warstore.com, m4warslive.com, or 888-253-3139. I'm a capitalist. I want to bring you products
[01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:10.320]  that blow you away so you keep ordering them. Get TurboForce. Get BrainForce. Still 50% off.
[01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:15.120]  That sale was supposed to end, but I've been too busy. This is the last day. New sales will start
[01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:18.960]  this weekend. It's going to be up for this weekend launching them. Whatever you do,
[01:50:18.960 --> 01:50:25.760]  take action today. A lot of big sales are about to end. m4warstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:31.680]  Getting back to our guest, I want to get Martina Markota back on soon. I'm always like,
[01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:37.200]  hey, get her on. Get her on. But now that they're depersoning her, she's here,
[01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:41.440]  I want to invite her back on a routine basis. Just like I've invited Faith Goldie back on. But just
[01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:44.880]  closing comments about where you see the world going, other things that are on your radar
[01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:51.520]  screen. Yeah, thank you for having me again. I'd like to come back anytime. But yeah, like I said,
[01:50:51.520 --> 01:50:57.440]  I just think that it's time for phase two. In Comic Skate, we say phase two. So there was a point
[01:50:57.440 --> 01:51:04.000]  of criticizing SJWs on the leftists and deconstructing what they're doing and showing how ridiculous
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:09.040]  it was, which actually really worked because it won us the election. Just their ridiculousness and
[01:51:09.040 --> 01:51:15.600]  exposing it really shows people how absurd they are. But then there's phase two, which is create.
[01:51:16.160 --> 01:51:21.040]  Let's build the world that we want to live in. So I think that's what you're doing with some of
[01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:26.320]  your products and stuff. You're not just letting them make the products. You're making the kind
[01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:32.880]  of products you want to live in. And what I do in the arts, I just want to do the arts that I want
[01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:38.560]  to do. And Faith is really talented at doing what she does. So everyone should just find their
[01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:43.760]  skill and their craft and what they have to offer the world and push that out in there into the
[01:51:43.760 --> 01:51:48.160]  world instead of just being reactionary. And people can find that different beautiful world
[01:51:48.160 --> 01:51:53.680]  you're building at martinamarcota.com. Just amazing work, Martina. And we look forward to
[01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:59.920]  speaking to you again very, very soon. Thank you. Bye, Faith. Bye. Faith, what she said is simple,
[01:51:59.920 --> 01:52:04.880]  but the simple is the most profound. We can't just be criticized how fallen and pathetic the
[01:52:04.880 --> 01:52:10.080]  globalist left is. We have to build that better world, which we're trying to do.
[01:52:11.760 --> 01:52:17.440]  I think also we have to be unafraid to be bold and to exert some sort of strength by which I don't
[01:52:17.440 --> 01:52:22.960]  mean I'm not calling for a physical revolution per se, but know that we are on the side of justice
[01:52:22.960 --> 01:52:28.640]  and truth and that we are fulfilling the destiny that our forefathers had envisioned when they first
[01:52:28.640 --> 01:52:34.960]  planted the seeds of the nations that we now exist in. And to walk boldly, don't let these
[01:52:35.920 --> 01:52:43.040]  serpents, these lizard people bully us into submission, to bully us into thinking that we
[01:52:43.040 --> 01:52:48.480]  are these horrendous names that they call us, racist, white supremacists. All these things are
[01:52:48.480 --> 01:52:56.560]  just tools of oppression to keep us quiet, to shut us up. We have to be bold and proclaim the fact
[01:52:56.560 --> 01:53:02.640]  that we are walking in truth, that loving your country, loving your family, all of that is natural.
[01:53:02.640 --> 01:53:07.840]  All of that is healthy and hating the idea of erasing our borders and moving towards
[01:53:08.400 --> 01:53:17.600]  more globalization is also okay. So do all of that and do it boldly. Be brave and be unafraid.
[01:53:17.600 --> 01:53:23.200]  Just because someone calls you a name or hurls some mud at you doesn't mean it's your turn to sit
[01:53:23.200 --> 01:53:26.960]  down. It's your turn to stiffen up your back, get out the shields and march on.
[01:53:28.960 --> 01:53:32.320]  And it's not because you're young and beautiful, but you remind me of my dad's mom because she was
[01:53:32.320 --> 01:53:37.120]  a strong, smart, powerful woman. It sounded just like you. Where both my grandmothers were amazing,
[01:53:37.120 --> 01:53:41.920]  and I'm not just saying this to be patronizing. I don't see a lot of women that act like you.
[01:53:41.920 --> 01:53:45.600]  I don't see a lot of men that act like you. When I was a little kid, it was everywhere. It's like
[01:53:45.600 --> 01:53:50.160]  it's dying even in Texas. Well, how are you different? And how many women do you know that
[01:53:50.160 --> 01:53:56.560]  are strong like you? Well, you know, I would say that it's a mixture of having strong female role
[01:53:56.560 --> 01:54:01.280]  models and strong male role models as well in my life. Most specifically, I'd say my mom,
[01:54:01.280 --> 01:54:04.800]  and my mom always pointing upwards. When I say, mom, you're the best mom in the world.
[01:54:04.800 --> 01:54:08.720]  And she said, it's because the Holy Spirit and God has helped me raised you. So, you know,
[01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:12.720]  I would say that if you're raising young girls right now, keep looking up while you're looking
[01:54:12.720 --> 01:54:19.200]  down, so to speak, and continue to be to be moved by the spirit of truth. And quite outside of that,
[01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:25.680]  I mean, I have always hungered and thirsted for truth. And here's the thing is that when I was
[01:54:25.680 --> 01:54:32.960]  in school, the truth, the counterfeit truth that I was sold, you know, was shoved down my throat.
[01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:39.920]  And so I saw things through a certain lens. And once my mom revealed herself to be a right winger,
[01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:44.320]  well, basically, after that moment, I was confronted with the fact that right wingers
[01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:49.680]  weren't some sort of, you know, knuckle dragging Neanderthals. And so I started engaging with
[01:54:49.680 --> 01:54:55.520]  their arguments. And from there, I became more of a conservative, call me what you will. But on
[01:54:55.520 --> 01:55:02.480]  top of that, I don't know, I think it's also my love of history, Alex. I've read, I know how great
[01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:10.640]  our nations are, and I know how terrible war and how terrible enemies of the good can be.
[01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:16.800]  I'm very, very acutely aware that we're closer than we think to our ancestors and those who came
[01:55:16.800 --> 01:55:21.040]  before us. And I'll be damned if we're going to make the same mistakes. I'll be damned if we're
[01:55:21.040 --> 01:55:25.680]  going to squander their legacies. So I suppose it's some of that. I'm very... I think the bottom
[01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:30.160]  line is you're connected to God, and it goes right through your ancestors, they were connected.
[01:55:30.160 --> 01:55:34.800]  And you are literally, you don't have GPS, you've got the Holy Spirit. People don't understand that.
[01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:37.920]  You're not going to find it in these fake churches. You go in and you feel the spirit of evil. It's
[01:55:37.920 --> 01:55:42.320]  a fake, you know, glad-handing. Everything's great spirit. But no, no. I mean, the real Holy Spirit
[01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:48.240]  drives you, pushes you to do things, gives you great insights. But it's a real adventure. Is
[01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:53.440]  that what you're saying? Absolutely. And we need to pray for better politicians, and we have to
[01:55:53.440 --> 01:55:59.200]  pray for the spirit of God to sweep our nations. Pray for your nations to be protected, and then
[01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:03.680]  continue to act, you know? It's one thing some people are called to contemplative lives, and if
[01:56:03.680 --> 01:56:08.800]  that's you, that's fine. But if that's not you, then don't just sit behind a keyboard, get out there,
[01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:13.280]  talk to your families about the truth, tell them about info wars, talk to your church groups,
[01:56:13.280 --> 01:56:20.000]  find a church group, you know, start some activism, even posturing campaigns. Help wake people up,
[01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:23.840]  do your part. We're going to do one more segment when we come back. We're a minute and a half
[01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:28.160]  out till break, but just... you brought up so many points we talked off air. Yellow vest,
[01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:32.320]  you're very excited about it. They're like 15 weeks in, they're getting killed, and it's just
[01:56:32.320 --> 01:56:37.520]  like Venezuela. It's incredible. Yeah, absolutely. This is in a democratic nation, and we've got
[01:56:37.520 --> 01:56:44.560]  police literally firing on people trying to exercise their democratic rights. And now
[01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:51.680]  it's the globalist worst nightmare, contagion. It's spreading across the globe to places like
[01:56:51.680 --> 01:56:56.080]  Canada. And I'm looking forward to telling you a little bit about that movement here in Canada,
[01:56:56.080 --> 01:57:01.200]  how it's mutated and manifested, and how we're bringing this movement right to the front steps
[01:57:01.200 --> 01:57:07.200]  of our legislature in Ottawa. We still got 40 seconds, but so it's definitely in Canada now.
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:12.800]  Oh, 100%. And it's so interesting. Like, there are a couple people who sort of against it because
[01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:16.960]  we don't have the same history of yellow vest and you need to keep them in their tanks, our
[01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:24.880]  trunks, et cetera. But it is symbolic of the fact that we are brothers fighting the same war,
[01:57:24.880 --> 01:57:30.160]  even though there are oceans that separate us. And so I think you're hinting at the French contingent

[01:59:47.920 --> 02:00:07.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:17.920 --> 02:00:43.360]  Hey Goldie is with us for a few more minutes. We've got the state rep in studio with Stewart
[02:00:43.360 --> 02:00:50.640]  Rhodes who's introduced legislation in Texas for Texas to fund our own wall that's coming up.
[02:00:51.280 --> 02:00:55.840]  Faith you were getting into the yellow vest exploding across not just Canada but other
[02:00:55.840 --> 02:01:01.040]  parts of the world a truly beautiful nationalist movement against carbon taxes against globalism
[02:01:01.040 --> 02:01:06.160]  against open borders but 15, 14 weeks how many weeks were into this the corporate media still
[02:01:06.160 --> 02:01:11.040]  hides who they really are. That's exactly right and we're seeing that trend again cross
[02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:15.760]  international borders so the same way that we saw in France the international media they're
[02:01:15.760 --> 02:01:20.240]  saying it's all about a fuel tax. It's all about a gas tax. That's all that's happening.
[02:01:20.240 --> 02:01:25.920]  Macron walks back on the gas tank and what do you know these people continue to stand on the streets
[02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:31.280]  march on the streets and in fact their numbers grow. Well this past week here in Canada we had
[02:01:31.280 --> 02:01:38.160]  our own United we roll convoy for Canada huge trucks come in thousands and thousands of miles
[02:01:38.160 --> 02:01:44.080]  from our far west and our far east into central Canada into the seat of power of Ottawa where
[02:01:44.080 --> 02:01:50.640]  Justin Trudeau is and their message was simple no more UN migrant compact we don't believe that you
[02:01:50.640 --> 02:01:55.760]  should be able to migrate to any country for any reason and that be declared a human right.
[02:01:55.760 --> 02:02:02.080]  No more open borders Justin Trudeau erased our southern boundary without a democratic mandate
[02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:09.360]  no more carbon tax this tax on literal pixie dust it's socialism okay and more pipelines we don't
[02:02:09.360 --> 02:02:14.000]  want to be dying oil from all these dirty nations that beat their women and make them have male
[02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:19.680]  guardianships like Saudi Arabia we got our own oil underneath this beautiful country drill baby
[02:02:19.680 --> 02:02:26.480]  drill and what does the the mainstream media the corporate media do here in Canada they say that
[02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:31.200]  it's all about pipelines well of course they do because we can talk about the economics but god
[02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:37.280]  forbid that we talk about the bigger issues that our country right now is frankly being evaded
[02:02:37.280 --> 02:02:42.880]  invaded rather by design by the globalists and so it was amazing for me and in a way
[02:02:44.400 --> 02:02:50.400]  kind of frightening to see these guys grassroots from all over the country come together organize
[02:02:50.400 --> 02:02:55.600]  this I mean there was no one leader there was no one group it was just a bunch of normal people
[02:02:55.600 --> 02:03:02.000]  truly organic not since that the opposite of astrotarth yes absolutely and and their their
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:07.760]  message was loud and clear along the side of their their their trucks and their buses and the media
[02:03:07.760 --> 02:03:12.880]  was just like with a whiteout going through and just saying we're going to highlight these parts
[02:03:12.880 --> 02:03:16.560]  and censor these other parts let me ask you this question I want to have you back soon just to get
[02:03:16.560 --> 02:03:20.400]  into this for a whole hour this is so incredible I think they run the risk of saying the French's
[02:03:20.400 --> 02:03:25.120]  back was broken so they pushed it as the vanguard of globalist social engineering and then it blew
[02:03:25.120 --> 02:03:31.040]  up biggest I see the attempt to crush and dominate nice friendly hardworking great Canadians of every
[02:03:31.040 --> 02:03:36.240]  race color and creed I think Canada could be the next big detonator in this because they're pushing
[02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:42.400]  you guys so hard yeah people don't realize that Canada is the canary in the coal mine we seem like
[02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:47.680]  you know the kind of lame brothers to the north maybe but we are actually the country right now
[02:03:47.680 --> 02:03:54.880]  facing the fastest rate of ethnic change globally we also have the highest per capita immigration
[02:03:54.880 --> 02:04:01.440]  rate globally actually twice that of the United States and our illegal numbers are way way high
[02:04:01.440 --> 02:04:06.800]  as a percentage of our population as well this all coming I'll be putting out a report pretty soon
[02:04:06.800 --> 02:04:11.600]  as you look at the people who are running our country and a huge percentage are actually people
[02:04:11.600 --> 02:04:17.600]  who aren't even born here so it goes to show you um that we're basically letting the foxes in charge
[02:04:17.600 --> 02:04:23.280]  of the hen house over here and at a certain point we like Canucks are going to start to push back
[02:04:23.280 --> 02:04:28.480]  don't forget we're the ones who know how to cross check properly and the good old hockey game so um
[02:04:28.480 --> 02:04:32.560]  I think that they continue to push us they can be darn sure that we're going to be pushing back and
[02:04:32.560 --> 02:04:38.640]  this week was just the very first domino in the line and again immigration works fine if people
[02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:42.320]  were brought in the melting pot but they're being indoctrinated to hate western nations when they're
[02:04:42.320 --> 02:04:47.360]  brought in and people are aware of it faith goldie you are in fuego you're awesome people should

[02:08:30.480 --> 02:08:36.720]  smollett from the hit show empire was attacked and beaten early this morning in chicago police
[02:08:36.720 --> 02:08:42.160]  are looking for two potential persons of interest in a possible hate crime against actor jesse smollett
[02:08:42.160 --> 02:08:48.560]  his attackers hurled racial and homophobic slurs two people yelled racist and homophobic slurs
[02:08:48.560 --> 02:08:54.640]  racial and homophobic slurs not only homophobia we're talking about racism we're talking about
[02:08:54.640 --> 02:09:00.880]  hate with steroids the offenders uttered this is maga country he said this maga country
[02:09:01.600 --> 02:09:05.920]  punches me right in the face they are looking for two suspects who are apparently wearing
[02:09:05.920 --> 02:09:11.760]  make america great again hats i'm disgusted by people who wear hats that say maga make america
[02:09:11.760 --> 02:09:15.360]  great again i don't like that it's being put out there in the media that this is a right
[02:09:15.360 --> 02:09:21.040]  possible yeah right i think that even solves a scene that makes people feel like well is he
[02:09:21.040 --> 02:09:27.600]  making this up the media has really cast so much doubt on his story which i find so personally
[02:09:27.600 --> 02:09:34.720]  offensive that a gay black man is targeted and then suddenly he becomes the victim of people's
[02:09:34.720 --> 02:09:39.600]  disbelief we have a media that's saying it's a debate whether or not which has happened to
[02:09:39.600 --> 02:09:44.720]  jesse smollett is a hate crime it's absurd it's coming from the president of the united states
[02:09:44.720 --> 02:09:50.080]  he's dog whistling every day senator quarry booker said the vicious attack when actor jesse
[02:09:50.080 --> 02:09:55.680]  was an attempted modern day lynching kamala harris calling the attack an attempted modern day lynching
[02:09:55.680 --> 02:10:02.400]  if his claims turn out to be a complete hoax it would just be one and a long list of fake phony
[02:10:02.400 --> 02:10:09.120]  concocted maga inspired hate crimes in the trump era sean hennadys gonna eat jesse smollett's
[02:10:09.120 --> 02:10:14.800]  lunch every single second the national media splint story was the perfect metaphor for the
[02:10:14.800 --> 02:10:21.200]  trump era it was also pretty clearly a total croc tucker carlson is going to eat jesse smollett's
[02:10:21.200 --> 02:10:25.920]  lunch mallet told them his attackers yelled pro make america great again or maga comments during
[02:10:25.920 --> 02:10:30.880]  the attack and that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now the fact
[02:10:30.880 --> 02:10:41.040]  that we have these fear models these people that are trying to separate us and it's just not okay
[02:10:41.040 --> 02:11:01.440]  this is america in 2019 how you like me now how you like me now how you like me now how you like me now
[02:11:01.440 --> 02:11:07.360]  how you like me now remember pal beaterman state rep here in the great state of texas is in

[02:11:18.080 --> 02:11:22.720]  appreciate you coming in because you were all over the news in the last week for introducing a
[02:11:22.720 --> 02:11:28.320]  legislation here in the great state of texas uh to uh build our own wall i guess we're the biggest
[02:11:28.320 --> 02:11:36.160]  part of the uh 2200 mile uh border and all the studies as you know a cut crime putting in a wall
[02:11:36.160 --> 02:11:41.600]  plus is constitutional and i love this i did have the state do it just kind of take take things
[02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:45.600]  because i mean you know i'm a states rights guy i think trump would support us so thanks for coming
[02:11:45.600 --> 02:11:51.040]  in and tell us about the plan well alex great to be here and uh what a what a privilege to be able
[02:11:51.040 --> 02:11:56.480]  to talk to people that really do care i mean when you're at the capital um you're talking to people
[02:11:56.480 --> 02:12:01.600]  that have no guts they have no courage and they just want to pass things off they want to kick the can
[02:12:01.600 --> 02:12:05.760]  so being here to talk to you knowing that you really care and that you've got people out there
[02:12:05.760 --> 02:12:10.320]  listening that really do care and they're going to listen and try to help but i'm glad you say
[02:12:10.320 --> 02:12:14.960]  that the power of the show is the audience yes i mean they're it mm-hmm that's exactly true with
[02:12:14.960 --> 02:12:22.240]  the power for me are my constituents and so in fact today um on uh texas tribune they're talking
[02:12:22.240 --> 02:12:26.960]  about how the border is not that important for the state of texas and for the people of texas
[02:12:26.960 --> 02:12:34.160]  and yet they just came out with a um with a poll texas tribune and the university of texas which
[02:12:34.160 --> 02:12:40.480]  you know two not very conservative outfits and the number one concern for the people of texas
[02:12:40.480 --> 02:12:47.360]  the number one concern for the people of texas is illegal immigration number two is border security
[02:12:47.360 --> 02:12:52.560]  and then number three is not even education yet that is what we're talking about this whole
[02:12:52.560 --> 02:12:57.280]  session is education but the number one and two of the people is not what we're talking about so
[02:12:57.280 --> 02:13:03.120]  obviously at the legislature uh we don't have priorities where the people feel the priority
[02:13:03.120 --> 02:13:07.840]  is for texas and so that's why it's so important for somebody to stand up and have the courage to
[02:13:07.840 --> 02:13:12.640]  speak out and say this is the priority of the people of texas this is who we represent and if
[02:13:12.640 --> 02:13:18.160]  we don't get this done um they're going to come after us and i i hope they do but uh well let's
[02:13:18.160 --> 02:13:23.680]  talk about the logistics of that because it's in the constitution and we talk about a wall it does
[02:13:23.680 --> 02:13:28.400]  need to be everywhere but these in these key areas we know it just stops the massive smuggling that
[02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:33.200]  you know the human trap people pouring across the border so as it as representative here in texas
[02:13:33.200 --> 02:13:36.720]  describe what your constituents are telling you what the border patrols telling you what the
[02:13:36.720 --> 02:13:41.520]  state police are telling you people to understand texas is right on the area with the most failed
[02:13:41.520 --> 02:13:47.200]  area of mexico and just the level of carnage we're talking about we are exactly right and you know
[02:13:47.200 --> 02:13:53.440]  texas has actually spent almost four billion dollars of the taxpayers money over the last eight years
[02:13:53.440 --> 02:13:58.240]  on border security but we really didn't get border security we just sent our law enforcement
[02:13:58.240 --> 02:14:03.600]  our dps down to the border to catch and release and hand them over to ice and so we didn't really
[02:14:03.600 --> 02:14:08.320]  get much for our money so under obama that just became delivery people for illegal aliens that's
[02:14:08.320 --> 02:14:12.240]  exactly right that's exactly right and so what we're doing is pointing out the fact that if we're
[02:14:12.240 --> 02:14:18.160]  going to put another billion dollars in this session which we will be uh 800 million for sure uh what
[02:14:18.160 --> 02:14:22.400]  are we going to get for that we're going to again send down our border security send out i mean our
[02:14:22.400 --> 02:14:28.320]  dps send down our law as high-price taxi drivers exactly exactly and that's and that's a shame
[02:14:28.320 --> 02:14:32.960]  so we need to as texas we're the ones that are paying the penalty we're the ones that are paying
[02:14:32.960 --> 02:14:38.560]  the penalty for for drugs coming into the country for human trafficking for our education system our
[02:14:38.560 --> 02:14:45.280]  jails our prisons are all being taxed because we know that the un is funding the breakdown of
[02:14:45.280 --> 02:14:48.720]  national sovereign team they go oh conspiracy theory that's their own statement i think if we
[02:14:48.720 --> 02:14:53.440]  don't address the real crisis people don't get what this is about breaking our borders that's
[02:14:53.440 --> 02:14:58.320]  exactly right and you know with our broken borders it's not just texas it's the rest of the country
[02:14:58.320 --> 02:15:03.280]  so with our bill that's come out and of course with a lot of the publicity we've gotten uh
[02:15:03.280 --> 02:15:09.040]  there are actually other states that are saying we want help and so part of our bill is to have an
[02:15:09.040 --> 02:15:15.360]  area and an opportunity to get gifts and funding from other sources other people and of course other
[02:15:15.360 --> 02:15:19.200]  states oh that's beautiful because states if you look at their budget and tell illegal aliens
[02:15:19.200 --> 02:15:24.000]  anchor babies the criminal cost is tens of billions even for smaller states they know that
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:28.320]  hey that'll help you better believe it because they're paying the penalty for us not securing our
[02:15:28.320 --> 02:15:33.680]  border but you know the big thing is most people say oh it's a federal issue so the states need to
[02:15:33.680 --> 02:15:38.240]  stay out of it well when you've got a broken federal government that hasn't done any what
[02:15:38.240 --> 02:15:42.160]  they're supposed to be doing for all these years the states have to take over and that's all well

[02:20:52.800 --> 02:20:58.800]  steward rode's i remember back when we were exposing the tsa groping of children which they
[02:20:58.800 --> 02:21:03.760]  didn't backed off of we got to pass on the house but not in the senate regardless though this can
[02:21:03.760 --> 02:21:08.640]  really catch wildfire if people get involved they get excited you were telling me during the break
[02:21:08.640 --> 02:21:12.640]  something huge we'll talk about at the end of the segment and then cover next segment that's
[02:21:12.640 --> 02:21:18.960]  as big as this or even bigger about them trying to turn the state blue but representative beaterman
[02:21:18.960 --> 02:21:25.200]  please continue with your move your bill to help the feds build the wall and how that would work
[02:21:25.840 --> 02:21:29.360]  well first of all we've got to find out where the funding is going to come from for the state of
[02:21:29.360 --> 02:21:35.200]  texas so we have a a large rainy day fund we've got plenty of money in there the problem with that
[02:21:35.200 --> 02:21:41.280]  is it takes two-thirds of a vote on the house floor and so the chairman of our homeland security
[02:21:41.280 --> 02:21:46.240]  committee has already said that even if the bill comes there's not going to be a hundred votes
[02:21:46.240 --> 02:21:52.480]  because you've got 67 democrats and they'll vote in a block so it's going to be difficult to get
[02:21:52.480 --> 02:21:57.040]  it passed with the rainy day fund so we're looking at other ways to be able to fund this but the
[02:21:57.040 --> 02:22:01.920]  important thing about the bill is it's not just for wall it's going to be for infrastructure it's
[02:22:01.920 --> 02:22:08.320]  going to be for technology it'll be for watershed clearing of the brush so that we can use surveillance
[02:22:08.320 --> 02:22:13.120]  it's going to be for roads just a number of things that need to be done on the border
[02:22:13.120 --> 02:22:19.440]  and the point is that's not being done right now because of the of the inability of the federal
[02:22:19.440 --> 02:22:25.680]  government to even move on any of those projects and let's be clear mexico has incredible culture
[02:22:25.680 --> 02:22:30.640]  i like going down there has great food great beaches great people i love mexicans seriously i
[02:22:30.640 --> 02:22:37.440]  mean i do but i was just down there for four or five days of my wife but even the safer places
[02:22:37.440 --> 02:22:41.600]  now are dangerous while i was there there were five people killed one day two people kill the next
[02:22:41.600 --> 02:22:46.320]  one kill the next day i was in cancun and i was like wow i actually shouldn't come down here it really
[02:22:46.320 --> 02:22:52.720]  is that dangerous now the 200 000 dead the last decade hundreds of thousands missing heads being
[02:22:52.720 --> 02:22:58.800]  chopped off a failed state the smugglers the coyotes all this is going on obviously the
[02:22:58.800 --> 02:23:04.080]  u.n and others know the weakness of europe the u.s is our openness they're running programs
[02:23:04.080 --> 02:23:08.960]  they're saying no borders no walls no usa at all that they want to overwhelm our courts overwhelm
[02:23:08.960 --> 02:23:14.480]  the border control and collapse us this is a clear and present bona fide clear danger to the nation
[02:23:14.480 --> 02:23:18.640]  steward and you're a military guy constitutional lawyer in your own right you've worked in congress
[02:23:18.640 --> 02:23:22.960]  from ron paul i mean obviously trump's emergency is totally constitutional but you're right why did
[02:23:22.960 --> 02:23:27.680]  he go the 1976 route where it's just for law enforcement no as commander in chief he doesn't
[02:23:27.680 --> 02:23:33.120]  need any of this it's the damn border yeah and and i surely encourage we want to encourage governor
[02:23:33.120 --> 02:23:39.200]  abbott to step up as the commander of the military forces in texas the texas national guard and your
[02:23:39.200 --> 02:23:43.120]  state guard which is called the uh the uh stexas guard by the way that wouldn't just be popular
[02:23:43.120 --> 02:23:48.720]  be the duty absolutely right it's the right thing to do and and also to back the bill to to um
[02:23:48.720 --> 02:23:52.720]  fund the wall as he said earlier he spent four billion dollars over the last eight years that's
[02:23:52.720 --> 02:23:56.160]  right so you could they could have built the wall already with texas money that's exactly so it's
[02:23:56.160 --> 02:24:00.880]  kind of silly for the governor i mean it looks good but he's sending these dps officers down there
[02:24:00.880 --> 02:24:05.520]  and i wouldn't talk to two of them this last week we were there on on the real grand and equal pass
[02:24:05.520 --> 02:24:08.480]  and they said well yeah i said what are you going to do with someone way to the shore
[02:24:08.480 --> 02:24:13.360]  call board patrol we're not actually going to do anything because the law is broken the federal
[02:24:13.360 --> 02:24:17.520]  law is broken so even when we're down there that's what's going to be so difficult difficult about
[02:24:17.520 --> 02:24:22.880]  this bill is we have to be able to build something so we need to be able to just be able to build
[02:24:22.880 --> 02:24:28.400]  something on the wall and start getting our own technology in our own uh surveillance down there
[02:24:28.400 --> 02:24:33.600]  because the laws are still so bad as long as you can get over the border and you give it give
[02:24:33.600 --> 02:24:38.160]  yourself up then you're in the political process that's what the whole so trumps right we have to
[02:24:38.160 --> 02:24:42.560]  put up that first defense where we do we have to put up well look what's happening equal pass
[02:24:43.200 --> 02:24:49.120]  when that caravan came up we only let 15 or so people in at a time or groups to be able to
[02:24:49.680 --> 02:24:56.640]  go through the process of finding out if they truly are here for um to flee their country
[02:24:56.640 --> 02:25:01.760]  and so uh the rest were sitting in the detention center and mexico gave them visas to stay in
[02:25:01.760 --> 02:25:07.040]  mexico to get jobs and since it's taken so long they're starting to go back into mexico or other
[02:25:07.040 --> 02:25:12.960]  places or go back home and you gotta remember this is not just mexicans this is otm other than
[02:25:12.960 --> 02:25:20.080]  mexicans and over 65 percent are from other countries and so mexico is now um being forced
[02:25:20.080 --> 02:25:25.280]  i believe by the trump administration which is a great thing to take responsibility for the other
[02:25:25.280 --> 02:25:30.560]  countries coming through their country before they come to the united states and look what's happened
[02:25:30.560 --> 02:25:36.000]  it has stopped that over in california that was a total mess they were actually um you know trying
[02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:41.760]  to break through the barriers that didn't happen in equal pass because the mexican government was
[02:25:41.760 --> 02:25:47.200]  actually um holding and detaining them on the mexican side and that was that was that was just
[02:25:47.200 --> 02:25:52.240]  one of the best things so people think oh well trump said he's gonna have mexico pay for the wall
[02:25:52.240 --> 02:25:57.280]  uh well mexico is paying a lot right now by keeping those people in mexico yeah but what
[02:25:57.280 --> 02:26:00.160]  is but they bust them all the way from their southern border all the way up there though
[02:26:00.800 --> 02:26:04.800]  the same mexico government i know but at least we kept them right there in mexico
[02:26:04.800 --> 02:26:10.560]  and those detention centers are actually starting to um sit out because people aren't sure what do
[02:26:10.560 --> 02:26:16.960]  you think of the democrats before the so-called deal got made saying cap beds at 16 500 when the
[02:26:16.960 --> 02:26:22.800]  fluctuation 40 000 100 000 people in any one month coming in they literally don't want judges they
[02:26:22.800 --> 02:26:28.160]  don't want anything they just want nothing totally open well they want they want the optics of showing
[02:26:28.160 --> 02:26:32.160]  look we don't have enough beds and these people are are sick to create the bum rush they want to
[02:26:32.160 --> 02:26:36.880]  advertise just like europe there's no border that's exactly right but they also want to have all they
[02:26:36.880 --> 02:26:45.040]  want is the um the message all they want is the optics of look this is a uh humanitarian crisis
[02:26:45.040 --> 02:26:51.200]  so we have to let them in in fact we had legislators um in this in texas that live on the border
[02:26:51.200 --> 02:26:56.560]  saying that they have people coming across the river and then these people these legislators
[02:26:56.560 --> 02:27:02.320]  will help them break the law to be able to go find border security so they can turn themselves in
[02:27:02.320 --> 02:27:07.120]  i mean well i was hanging out no one comes across the border except to the i was hanging out with a
[02:27:07.120 --> 02:27:12.640]  major um a mexican police chief from major city and he said it's a total joke of course you got to
[02:27:12.640 --> 02:27:17.520]  have some type of papers across the border of course you got to have beds he goes you think
[02:27:17.520 --> 02:27:22.720]  mexico is bad guatemala is collapsing into us and our president is saying basically open the
[02:27:22.720 --> 02:27:28.000]  borders up that's right so they're trying to collapse mexico too i mean this is like insane
[02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:33.280]  i mean notice brazil closes borders months ago to venezuela it's a failed state when your next
[02:27:33.280 --> 02:27:37.280]  door to a failed state you better damn well close your border well this is what's so great about
[02:27:37.280 --> 02:27:42.400]  trump when you stand up and you stand up against these things mexico is going to start feeling the
[02:27:42.400 --> 02:27:46.160]  heat the other countries have felt the heat and they'll start doing their job they're right they're
[02:27:46.160 --> 02:27:50.880]  using us as a steam valve right sure exactly and that's uh that's exactly what's been now we're about
[02:27:50.880 --> 02:27:55.600]  to go to break a state rep here but drop the bombshell when we come back i know they're trying to
[02:27:55.600 --> 02:28:00.880]  pull out all the money must get rid of history but they they're now want the alamo torn down

[02:33:55.920 --> 02:34:02.240]  isis woman that married an isis fighter five years ago went over there worked with this guy on record

[02:34:07.760 --> 02:34:12.640]  stupid nose ring trying to look like the you know the state rep or that congresswoman administration

[02:34:17.200 --> 02:34:26.240]  papers and and i know in fact that i was a citizen and when i tried filing for a passport it was
[02:34:26.240 --> 02:34:32.160]  very easy it came in ten days so i thought i didn't have a problem and i'm sure there's no problem
[02:34:32.160 --> 02:34:39.760]  and i know my lawyer hopefully is working on it and he will win the case what do you want to do
[02:34:39.760 --> 02:34:43.600]  if you went back to the states what do you think will happen to you if you were allowed to go back
[02:34:43.600 --> 02:34:51.440]  of course i'll be giving jail time john you as the deputy assistant attorney general okay so
[02:34:51.440 --> 02:34:57.920]  listen you left alabama to go fight with your husband who was in isis and that's all admitted
[02:34:57.920 --> 02:35:03.520]  and now you want to come no no no stay in your wonderland and that's all i'm saying is that if
[02:35:03.520 --> 02:35:08.320]  you're a muslim that loves america and this is all great stay here we love you but if you want to go
[02:35:08.320 --> 02:35:14.320]  join isis being all this and now you're bitching that we won't let you back in wearing your hijab
[02:35:14.320 --> 02:35:17.840]  sitting there i don't want to get you to wait it on this you're trying to get a border wall
[02:35:17.840 --> 02:35:22.240]  built to protect the state but this is getting crazy and it's definitely getting crazy in fact
[02:35:23.600 --> 02:35:32.880]  we've got uh some legislations about the radical slum uh islam um um you answer care care so you
[02:35:32.880 --> 02:35:39.520]  got the council american islamic relations and they're basically a hamas group a muslim brotherhood
[02:35:39.520 --> 02:35:44.880]  and yet they're allowed to come to the capital and be infiltrating into all different areas of the
[02:35:44.880 --> 02:35:48.160]  united states government as well as the texas government oh they're taking my bank accounts
[02:35:48.160 --> 02:35:52.640]  away no one ever touches cares bank accounts right who's been directly caught giving money to hamas
[02:35:52.640 --> 02:35:57.520]  so we're we're uh we're in on that too but we have so much to try to get done right now in the
[02:35:57.520 --> 02:36:01.840]  and so no i understand you're focused on the border so let's get to the big enchilada
[02:36:01.840 --> 02:36:04.880]  people say okay they're going to pull down debbie crock and statue they're going to
[02:36:04.880 --> 02:36:09.440]  pull down sam houston's uh statue you know he was against uh having the civil war these people
[02:36:09.440 --> 02:36:13.280]  don't know jack crap they just say they're alive during this period well slavery's still going on
[02:36:13.280 --> 02:36:18.480]  in africa going to blow africa the middle east in somalia they're selling women in sex slavery
[02:36:18.480 --> 02:36:23.280]  every day at sex markets oh but no leftist cares about that because jeffrey or jesse smollett
[02:36:23.280 --> 02:36:27.920]  doesn't care but tell us about your bill to stop pulling down the monuments because they're now as
[02:36:27.920 --> 02:36:33.040]  he warned targeting the alamo that's exactly right so i actually have two bills because
[02:36:33.040 --> 02:36:37.440]  it's so important that we protect the shrine of texas which is the alamo and so i'll start with
[02:36:37.440 --> 02:36:43.360]  that bill real quick basically it's a fight between the state of texas and the city of san
[02:36:43.360 --> 02:36:51.040]  atonio city of san atonio wants to remove the cenotaph uh the the empty tomb for our defenders
[02:36:51.040 --> 02:36:57.360]  that died and shed their blood on that spot and then san anna dragged them four blocks away burned
[02:36:57.360 --> 02:37:02.240]  their bodies so there would not be a proper burial so there wouldn't be a remembrance of our defenders
[02:37:02.240 --> 02:37:06.560]  and then a hundred years later on the centennial of so they want to complete let's explain that
[02:37:06.560 --> 02:37:12.560]  they want to complete san anna's operation that's exactly right who was aided mexico lost
[02:37:12.560 --> 02:37:19.440]  guatemala and was later deposed that's exactly right so that's in a city of san atonio wants
[02:37:19.440 --> 02:37:25.120]  then to tell the 300 years of history on the alamo battlefield where the battle was just part of it
[02:37:25.120 --> 02:37:30.400]  okay the state of texas should be going against that but unfortunately our general land office
[02:37:30.400 --> 02:37:36.240]  headed by chairman bush uh is allowing this to happen because they want to deal so badly with
[02:37:36.240 --> 02:37:41.600]  san atonio uh to have this re-envision them the alamo what the hell's wrong with san antonio
[02:37:42.800 --> 02:37:47.280]  you know well look what san antonio has done for the alamo since you know for the last 150 years
[02:37:47.280 --> 02:37:51.760]  they have just they were supposed to maintain they out the cenotaph they haven't they've let
[02:37:51.760 --> 02:37:55.920]  for until like 60 years ago it was a warehouse right they let all these buildings encroach on it
[02:37:55.920 --> 02:38:00.720]  and then they they wonder why is it why is it not a um why is it looked the way it does well
[02:38:00.720 --> 02:38:05.200]  san antonio did it to themselves you know and so right now they're expecting the state of texas to
[02:38:05.200 --> 02:38:10.320]  fund them so they could make it a bigger attraction why would they want to get rid of something that's
[02:38:10.320 --> 02:38:14.000]  such an attraction in the name of making an attraction well because it's already an attraction
[02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:18.240]  it's one of the number one so people are going to come so now san antonio wants to put their
[02:38:18.240 --> 02:38:23.920]  political correctness on that site and bring in the indigenous indians uh bring in actually
[02:38:23.920 --> 02:38:29.440]  tributes to mexico because we were so mean to to defeat them and take the defenders who died for
[02:38:29.440 --> 02:38:34.880]  our state that gave us our independence out 500 feet away and put them in the free speech area
[02:38:34.880 --> 02:38:40.640]  where san antonio owns that land and the battlefield will then be uh a place to tell the hundred the
[02:38:40.640 --> 02:38:44.640]  300 years of history instead so that they could have a bigger attraction with the other five
[02:38:44.640 --> 02:38:50.240]  mission they also want to be on a uh just purely a mission part of the world heritage system under
[02:38:50.240 --> 02:38:55.520]  the un under the un and well let's expand on that this shows the average texan whether it be black
[02:38:55.520 --> 02:39:01.840]  white ispanic who's a patriot is arrogant and thinks texas is patriot is red as if the republics
[02:39:01.840 --> 02:39:06.160]  are perfect they don't get the democrats who look at the demographics the brainwashing they
[02:39:06.160 --> 02:39:11.680]  think they're about to take it and if you look at all the bedo loss but he won a bunch of uh
[02:39:11.680 --> 02:39:17.520]  the courts you name it we're california 30 years ago was more right wing than texas texas better
[02:39:17.520 --> 02:39:23.840]  wake the hell up man i'm sick of this crap we are so close to committing suicide boy that is so true
[02:39:23.840 --> 02:39:28.960]  i mean that is more than true i mean in the capital right now that is so true we see california
[02:39:28.960 --> 02:39:34.080]  turned it took a number of years we turned really quickly this last election and they're looking at
[02:39:34.640 --> 02:39:40.240]  taking over the house next election if we don't really get our get our act together and here it
[02:39:40.240 --> 02:39:46.400]  is on the world heritage site so the glo says the um will have nothing to do with the alamo
[02:39:46.400 --> 02:39:50.560]  they'll be they won't have any management they won't have the oversight of the of the alamo and
[02:39:50.560 --> 02:39:55.920]  that is true because the world heritage organization does not manage any sites they just lay the
[02:39:55.920 --> 02:40:00.720]  guidelines down if you want to be a world heritage site and be a designation for that you have to
[02:40:00.720 --> 02:40:05.600]  follow their political correctness sanitary which gives control the whole region of them it's right
[02:40:05.600 --> 02:40:10.720]  and so the the lease that we signed where we don't own the land any we don't own the land in between
[02:40:10.720 --> 02:40:15.600]  the alamo so don't you agree with what the land commissioner earlier well when he said we shouldn't
[02:40:15.600 --> 02:40:20.240]  let leave this to the daughter's republic even though my mom and her grandma were involved
[02:40:20.240 --> 02:40:25.200]  we need to take it away and have the state run it well we needed more funding into it okay so
[02:40:25.200 --> 02:40:29.200]  that's the problem the the daughters didn't have the funding and they did a great job without them
[02:40:29.200 --> 02:40:33.200]  we wouldn't even have the alamo i agree you're right but uh they're the ones that wouldn't got it
[02:40:33.200 --> 02:40:38.240]  that's exactly right they're the ones that saved it okay but the point is the the state of texas
[02:40:38.240 --> 02:40:43.120]  can do a great job there but the problem is they're trying to um so what needs to happen what needs to
[02:40:43.120 --> 02:40:49.280]  happen to save the alamo oh my god if we can't even protect like a 300 sanctuary uh you know shrine
[02:40:49.280 --> 02:40:54.400]  what can we do so my monument bills to stop any monuments from being moved that are over 20 years
[02:40:54.400 --> 02:40:59.120]  old uh if you do you've got to have a vote of two-thirds make them a heritage site well none of the
[02:40:59.120 --> 02:41:04.160]  un but just under texas well we're i'm telling you a historical site well we don't trust the
[02:41:04.160 --> 02:41:07.920]  texas historical commission either so we got to be careful who we give it to right now we have to
[02:41:07.920 --> 02:41:13.040]  protect it by not allowing it to be moved but we also are going to do imminent domain and take over
[02:41:13.040 --> 02:41:18.000]  the land that san Antonio owns in front of the alamo the alamo well that's the middle of domain
[02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:21.600]  i would support the state needs to take over the alamo i mean that is ours it was supposed to be
[02:41:21.600 --> 02:41:26.080]  given to the state of texas but san antonio decided to give a long term lease and the geolo
[02:41:26.080 --> 02:41:30.960]  accepted it so in that long term lease we cannot jeopardize the designation of a world heritage
[02:41:30.960 --> 02:41:35.440]  state rep here uh bernieman i love what you're doing but i don't want to cuss on air but i call
[02:41:35.440 --> 02:41:40.400]  it the chicken you know what dimension i mean how could someone want to piss on the alamo when it
[02:41:40.400 --> 02:41:45.840]  already makes san antonio hundreds of millions a year probably more i mean why why war well it's
[02:41:45.840 --> 02:41:51.520]  cultural war because if you can take that down 170 80 years later you mean you're winning right
[02:41:51.520 --> 02:41:55.760]  it's a cultural warrior exactly right stewart but it's also a lot it's all about money i mean
[02:41:55.760 --> 02:42:02.000]  it's going to be a lot of money huge contracts a foundation um you know it's hard to follow the
[02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:06.000]  money because there's so many different bank accounts and they're not they're not able to
[02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:09.680]  be looked at by the let's talk about what are some of the other monuments they've already torn down
[02:42:09.680 --> 02:42:14.720]  well how about what's going on in dalis right now the city council and the mayor are debating on
[02:42:14.720 --> 02:42:21.120]  taking down one of the um uh one of the uh civil war monuments but the question is do we wrecking
[02:42:21.120 --> 02:42:28.000]  ball it or are we become more humane and take it down piece by piece i mean this is getting sick
[02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:33.040]  and there's no voice by the people it's just the local officials making this decision and that's
[02:42:33.040 --> 02:42:38.560]  where we have to stop and now google says get rid of the get rid of the term mother and father
[02:42:38.560 --> 02:42:44.000]  and there's no there's no end to what the the control left wants to wrecking ball we'll be
[02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:49.040]  right back with the plan to build a wall to defend texas launch by texas straight ahead

[02:47:22.560 --> 02:47:32.160]  i got my song and i've got you with me tonight maybe it's time we got back to california running
[02:47:32.160 --> 02:47:42.000]  texas let's go this is where i live teaching five-year-old boys to wear dresses all right that's
[02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:50.880]  where i live with needles and homeless people crapping all over the ground i'm gonna stop
[02:47:50.880 --> 02:47:56.400]  being given around let's get serious between state rep kyle bederman is here with us he's
[02:47:56.400 --> 02:48:01.440]  introduced the bill it's moving forward with your support for texas to fund building its own
[02:48:01.440 --> 02:48:05.520]  section of wall that would save a lot of money but you dropped a bombshell on me during the break
[02:48:05.520 --> 02:48:10.000]  it's not just they're trying to take over the alamo they're actually wanting to fly a mexican
[02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:14.640]  flag over it tell us about that well you got to realize who's running san antonio you've got the
[02:48:14.640 --> 02:48:19.200]  castro brothers and of course their whole family and they're the ones that got started on this
[02:48:19.200 --> 02:48:24.560]  re-envision re-envision the alamo they they they brought it up because it's been talked about for
[02:48:24.560 --> 02:48:30.640]  years but they're the ones that really got it going and of course that would be uh their ideal
[02:48:30.640 --> 02:48:37.040]  and it's been talked about right now to move the uh the uh the uh senatef which is defender's monument
[02:48:37.040 --> 02:48:42.640]  and then put in a statue of indigenous indian chief uh and then you know a statue of a maybe
[02:48:42.640 --> 02:48:49.440]  william travis maybe and then of course grave size for indigenous indians and then um tributes to
[02:48:49.440 --> 02:48:55.760]  the mexican army and it has been spoken about and so i i just can't make these things up this is where
[02:48:55.760 --> 02:49:00.320]  we're heading and when you look at the leadership of san antonio that will give you the reason why
[02:49:00.320 --> 02:49:06.160]  it's heading that direction but it's so pissy and why not just embrace texas history
[02:49:08.400 --> 02:49:14.800]  that's why don't liberals do that why do they always want to tear down our values and principles
[02:49:14.800 --> 02:49:19.040]  because they're they they need to tear down christianity because that gets rid of morals
[02:49:19.040 --> 02:49:22.800]  and without morals they could do what they want why don't we build a statue to jesse schmollett
[02:49:25.360 --> 02:49:29.440]  i'm sure they would probably do that before they would want to have a statue of some more of the
[02:49:29.440 --> 02:49:34.080]  defenders and that is what is so sad again it was the white people unfortunately we're the
[02:49:34.080 --> 02:49:41.200]  ones that are bad and so whatever they need to do to take us down is let me ask this because again
[02:49:41.200 --> 02:49:45.440]  it's not people that are brown or whatever they're bad it's the leadership of the globalist i mean
[02:49:45.440 --> 02:49:51.280]  skirt you know your you know your mom's family from mexico great people but we have to stop getting
[02:49:51.280 --> 02:49:55.440]  into the this thing that we're back because we're white why does everybody want to get into a white
[02:49:55.440 --> 02:50:02.000]  run country so fast well i look at my family my family's been from the border for over a hundred
[02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:08.480]  years and again my wife is hispanic and her whole family um the problem is is the messaging that has
[02:50:08.480 --> 02:50:15.520]  been gone given to especially the hispanic community as not they are a culture of values
[02:50:15.520 --> 02:50:20.480]  and principles of christianity of of their catholic church and their catholic principles
[02:50:20.480 --> 02:50:26.800]  which would be pro-life and yet they're voting for abortion so it is just that's how they say
[02:50:27.360 --> 02:50:31.680]  bido despite all his fraud was barely beaten enough hispanics called their family and said
[02:50:31.680 --> 02:50:36.960]  you know he's for partial birth abortion yes and you know how could you vote for that
[02:50:36.960 --> 02:50:42.000]  because you vote for because the leaders have been telling you what to do and so the answer is as
[02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:45.600]  americans no matter what color we are we've not been doing our job getting the word out about the
[02:50:45.600 --> 02:50:50.960]  democrats that's exactly the average texas sits there on their ass myself oh texas is fine no
[02:50:50.960 --> 02:50:55.680]  we've almost lost texas folks just like calo so next time you look down on france or look down on
[02:50:55.680 --> 02:51:00.560]  california or look down on wherever remember they were once free too well you know uh being
[02:51:00.560 --> 02:51:06.080]  conservative was one thing it all comes from leadership as you said earlier what is the
[02:51:06.080 --> 02:51:12.480]  leadership and if our leadership is not going to stand for texas then that's how it'll fall
[02:51:12.480 --> 02:51:16.960]  and if you want to try to play it safe and you want to try to you know you know kind of deny
[02:51:16.960 --> 02:51:21.680]  what's really happening so that you can be popular uh that's where the problems well let me tell this
[02:51:21.680 --> 02:51:26.000]  big secret you're going to get demonized we're coming out of tomorrow but any smart constituents
[02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:31.680]  kind of think that's a good thing the established republican party grovels to corporate media when
[02:51:31.680 --> 02:51:37.040]  it has no power only the power we give it i'm not a big roosevelt fan i like some of what he did
[02:51:37.040 --> 02:51:44.320]  shamsa nazis but the only fear we have is fear itself it's that last illusion that's all there is
[02:51:44.320 --> 02:51:51.120]  there is no power there we just have to stop giving them the power oh my gosh if i stand up for not
[02:51:51.120 --> 02:51:56.800]  sexualizing children or i stand up against you know big pharma pushing you know hardcore drugs on
[02:51:56.800 --> 02:52:01.920]  kids i'm going to be demonized good you want to be attacked by bad guys why the hell are we so afraid
[02:52:01.920 --> 02:52:06.400]  well you know and as and the poll i just gave you earlier in the show where the number one and
[02:52:06.400 --> 02:52:12.400]  number two most important issues to the state of texas by the constituents in texas is lily
[02:52:12.400 --> 02:52:18.160]  illegal immigration and border security and we need our governor to put those priorities first
[02:52:18.160 --> 02:52:21.440]  and that's why it's going to be so important what stewart's going to be doing down the border
[02:52:21.440 --> 02:52:27.120]  where we can announce that we would like or we demand that our leadership our leader in the state
[02:52:27.120 --> 02:52:34.960]  of texas uh governor abbott to stand for trump oh i mean how popular would abbot be if he called
[02:52:34.960 --> 02:52:40.080]  for a bill of a five dollar surcharge on every driver's license to build the wall texas would rush
[02:52:40.080 --> 02:52:45.200]  into it stewart yeah governor abbott needs to take a lead he's he's in the hot seat he needs to
[02:52:45.200 --> 02:52:50.400]  declare an emergency in texas which will bolster president trump and give him some support i don't
[02:52:50.400 --> 02:52:55.840]  know why abbots been silent he needs to step up and be the leader of texas and support uh kyle
[02:52:55.840 --> 02:53:00.240]  beaterman's bill well they build the wall that's exactly right and and if they take a poll which i
[02:53:00.240 --> 02:53:05.760]  know they are and they may not want to you know acknowledge it but the poll is the people want
[02:53:05.760 --> 02:53:09.760]  border security and they want illegal immigration has trump chimed in on what you're doing yet
[02:53:10.320 --> 02:53:14.720]  well we're trying to get him to chime in here he has spoken to governor abbott and lieutenant
[02:53:14.720 --> 02:53:22.800]  governor patrick he has spoken to them but again um you know it's we need to we it's it's up to us
[02:53:22.800 --> 02:53:27.120]  it's not up to donald trump donald trump is doing well yeah and i love mexico but it's not like
[02:53:27.120 --> 02:53:31.840]  we're on the border with switzerland uh i mean and even rich countries have borders for reason
[02:53:31.840 --> 02:53:36.480]  criminals are coming across the idea that we can't have any borders any walls no usa at all
[02:53:37.040 --> 02:53:42.160]  that's what this is about and i've said it and lou dobbs talked about and they said oh you know
[02:53:42.160 --> 02:53:47.040]  basically kick him off air we need to criminally charge the people that are transferring state
[02:53:47.040 --> 02:53:52.560]  department money to soros to fund these caravans the attempt to break our immigration system our
[02:53:52.560 --> 02:53:58.000]  lenient system is only invited people to exploit it and sure why do you think they want to totally
[02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:04.640]  break the border well it's it's obvious they want to take over the united states um with people they
[02:54:04.640 --> 02:54:10.880]  believe will vote their way and you know the mexican tajanos who fought the alamo and all their
[02:54:10.880 --> 02:54:15.600]  descendants are flag waving patriotic americans too i saw them down at the opasso rally that
[02:54:15.600 --> 02:54:20.000]  trump's rally about a quarter of the audience for hispanic americans so it's not a racial issue
[02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:24.720]  but it is a cultural issue they want to flood us with people in larger capacities and we can
[02:54:24.720 --> 02:54:29.280]  assimilate um and also condition them not to assimilate you said earlier the new models of
[02:54:29.280 --> 02:54:34.400]  salad bowls supposedly don't assimilate while you're on flag that's just why no it won't work
[02:54:34.400 --> 02:54:37.920]  they're not going to come here said if you're old flag was so good why the hell you coming here
[02:54:37.920 --> 02:54:41.440]  right in the city roosevelt said if you come here and assimilate then you're an american well
[02:54:41.440 --> 02:54:45.680]  we have an obligation and duty would be proud to accept you and if you refuse to assimilate
[02:54:45.680 --> 02:54:51.200]  you don't belong here well i believe that the the hispanic um population wants to assimilate
[02:54:51.200 --> 02:54:56.400]  wants to be called americans except that they are getting brain there's no leadership they're getting
[02:54:56.400 --> 02:55:01.280]  pressured by the um you know the the liberal leadership the liberal the media leaders and
[02:55:01.280 --> 02:55:05.200]  so you're saying there's no leadership that's that's correct was well they have no they have
[02:55:05.200 --> 02:55:10.160]  great leadership from the other side i'm saying there's no oppositional right you're exactly right
[02:55:10.160 --> 02:55:14.080]  it's all right representative how do people follow what you're doing how do they get involved
[02:55:14.080 --> 02:55:19.200]  how they get the governor and others to promote this well the governor you have to call the governor
[02:55:19.200 --> 02:55:24.800]  you just gotta flood his phone lines and let him know what you feel about the about the border
[02:55:24.800 --> 02:55:28.640]  security issue and about illegal immigration and that should be the number one priority here in the
[02:55:28.640 --> 02:55:33.760]  state of texas and that we need to support donald trump and he needs to declare an emergency in texas
[02:55:33.760 --> 02:55:38.400]  and support your bill that's exactly right and again everyone gets so bent out of shape that oh
[02:55:38.400 --> 02:55:42.000]  it's a wall we're not going to have a wall on the whole border for a thousand so we need to get on
[02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:47.760]  the offense and have beto declared as a traitor and all the leftist groups and the un we need
[02:55:47.760 --> 02:55:51.920]  indictments we need the state police the texas rangers kicking down their doors when beto says
[02:55:51.920 --> 02:55:56.880]  i got two thousand more in today we just put up with this open globalist invasion it's time to
[02:55:56.880 --> 02:56:01.440]  take out the brass knuckles politically or roll over and die it's that simple victory or death
[02:56:01.440 --> 02:56:06.640]  and quote colonel travis well and you said you know again work on this alamo bill when i take the
[02:56:06.640 --> 02:56:12.480]  quotes from colonel travis you take the quotes from uh um once again and other people that were at
[02:56:12.480 --> 02:56:17.840]  the alamo you know they knew what was going to happen they knew what the future was going to be
[02:56:17.840 --> 02:56:22.400]  if we did not keep that and notice everybody's racing to get away from what santa anna set up
[02:56:22.400 --> 02:56:26.400]  to what colonel travis set up because that was what was honorable we're not perfect but you
[02:56:26.400 --> 02:56:30.800]  know what you got your land here you got decent start there's not cartels running your life right
[02:56:30.800 --> 02:56:36.320]  when you people are willing to die for that fine and you read what these men said back then and
[02:56:36.320 --> 02:56:42.400]  how could you do what you're doing today by an allowed new you know desecrating the the alamo
[02:56:42.400 --> 02:56:46.960]  when these people if they were alive they got to be rolling in their graves this has got to be so
[02:56:46.960 --> 02:56:51.680]  upsetting to them cartels are worse than santa anna yeah they're worse than santa anna
[02:56:51.680 --> 02:56:58.400]  he was nice compared fairly cartels but the left worships a dictator oh yeah yeah definitely just
[02:56:58.400 --> 02:57:02.640]  like they worship but you know all these news articles the left is worshiping uh where you

[03:00:50.160 --> 03:00:54.960]  that right now is the average texas in a coma riding around thinking they got everything going well

[03:01:09.760 --> 03:01:16.880]  up here in texas and as uh calby was just telling me on the break you've got poncho navara in charge
[03:01:16.880 --> 03:01:21.840]  of your homeland security committee the democrat anti-gun democrat it's a trojan horse right
[03:01:21.840 --> 03:01:26.000]  there in the legislature in charge he'll be the one that'll put the bill up and with it with his
[03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:29.840]  cloud authority of being the homeland security chairman they'll say this is necessary for the
[03:01:29.840 --> 03:01:36.320]  security of texas but explain what a red flag law is what a red flag law is it's really a gun
[03:01:36.320 --> 03:01:42.880]  confiscation law the owners america is correct it's all about individualized gun confiscation
[03:01:42.880 --> 03:01:47.840]  they picture the the worst-case scenario for for gun owners is mass confiscation right well we'll
[03:01:47.840 --> 03:01:52.960]  rise up and fight back this is the worst-case scenario for an individual gun owner that someone
[03:01:52.960 --> 03:01:58.240]  is smeared without you knowing it they go to a judge in secret you don't even know what's happening
[03:01:58.240 --> 03:02:03.200]  and a secret ex parte hearing they accuse you of being in danger of the community you might
[03:02:03.200 --> 03:02:08.160]  trot out your social media history for example your public stickers or your political affiliations
[03:02:08.160 --> 03:02:11.840]  you don't even know what's happening you can't confront your accusers you can't present witnesses
[03:02:11.840 --> 03:02:16.160]  on your behalf you don't get a jury trial in front of some leftist judge then they decide they're
[03:02:16.160 --> 03:02:20.400]  going to come take your guns the judge gives the order to the police the police come to your door
[03:02:20.400 --> 03:02:24.080]  and that's when you first know there's any problem at all when the cops are knocking on your door
[03:02:24.080 --> 03:02:28.160]  it's legalized swatting you know you call the police and say this guy's a threat get a swatting
[03:02:28.160 --> 03:02:33.040]  to read his house that's what it is so it's like the Baker act went on steroids and instead of getting
[03:02:33.040 --> 03:02:37.840]  out in a couple days for no reason your guns are gone exactly and it already had a death in Maryland
[03:02:37.840 --> 03:02:42.880]  a man was his his uh he had a gun an argument with his adult sister who doesn't even live with him
[03:02:42.880 --> 03:02:47.280]  and she called the cops to get revenge on him for the argument they came to his door
[03:02:47.280 --> 03:02:51.440]  and he made a false move didn't do what they told him to do they killed him well i remember
[03:02:51.440 --> 03:02:55.920]  like three years ago it was Bloomberg headlines gun confiscation begins in california and go
[03:02:55.920 --> 03:03:00.000]  wait they're admitting their plan they've gone from denying it now to admitting it and it was like
[03:03:00.000 --> 03:03:04.320]  oh somebody thought this guy was mentally ill we took the gun but then you've got this guy at the
[03:03:04.320 --> 03:03:09.920]  illinois plant 20 years could not have gone he got one went and killed people they didn't put
[03:03:09.920 --> 03:03:14.400]  it in the database so again they don't even put real people like the guy a few years ago at the
[03:03:14.400 --> 03:03:18.720]  texas church had been in a military mental institution the judicated crazy could know
[03:03:18.720 --> 03:03:23.120]  a gun had one still went and bought it wasn't the database so the feds don't put it in the
[03:03:23.120 --> 03:03:27.360]  database when you've been a judicated crazy but now they're just going to randomly say oh well
[03:03:27.360 --> 03:03:31.360]  if your neighbor thinks you're not should we take your guns exactly and there's a federal bill coming
[03:03:31.360 --> 03:03:37.440]  through um lindsay gramm's proposing it and you've got uh what's his name out of out of florida
[03:03:38.160 --> 03:03:44.880]  i'm drawing a blank now doge no the the cuban rubio rubio's cosponsors you got republicans
[03:03:44.880 --> 03:03:49.680]  the national level pushing these these red flag bills as well because it sounds good oh we're
[03:03:49.680 --> 03:03:53.360]  going to get rid of the crazy people right oh yeah no one no one who's a dandruff community should
[03:03:53.360 --> 03:03:56.960]  should have a gun and unfortunately a trump administration so far has supported them and
[03:03:56.960 --> 03:04:01.280]  his new attorney general supports them so people have got to wake up and realize this is coming
[03:04:01.280 --> 03:04:06.080]  if trump signs a red flag bill trump has to know it will destroy him he'll be done he'll be his goose
[03:04:06.080 --> 03:04:11.680]  will be cooked so what type of his advice is he gonna be cooked well he is like literally creeping
[03:04:11.680 --> 03:04:15.680]  around the edge of disaster he's getting horrible legal advice to point out the other day of dr
[03:04:15.680 --> 03:04:19.680]  veer he's getting bad legal advice about his declaration of emergency he's getting horrible legal
[03:04:19.680 --> 03:04:24.160]  advice about red flag bills and so we're working on both those fronts to try to put some good advice
[03:04:24.160 --> 03:04:28.480]  in his hands of what he should be doing because like you you said we got tom papper taken over

[03:08:32.560 --> 03:08:39.200]  democrats and republicans are investigating him for being directed by higher ups to boost the whole
[03:08:39.200 --> 03:08:44.400]  show's value obviously that's the really the big takeaway and the big city chicago machine
[03:08:45.120 --> 03:08:52.800]  now we're going to have tom pappard at real get trump a real g.e trump he also heads up the
[03:08:52.800 --> 03:08:58.480]  trump god emperor website and of course manages the tv station that we're on he's going to be
[03:08:58.480 --> 03:09:03.040]  taking over here in just a minute but steward you were finishing up with the whole red flag laws
[03:09:03.040 --> 03:09:09.840]  and national gun confiscation plan the democrats now incredibly uh have come out and said oh we'll
[03:09:09.840 --> 03:09:13.840]  have our own emergency and take your guns yeah and you got republicans signing on to it and like
[03:09:13.840 --> 03:09:17.440]  i said earlier you also have people inside the bush administration or the uh trump administration
[03:09:17.440 --> 03:09:21.760]  giving him terrible legal advice but you're from the trump the former bush administration right
[03:09:21.760 --> 03:09:29.920]  yes yes he got bar a rehashed bush guy another neocon coming in who openly advocates for red
[03:09:29.920 --> 03:09:34.800]  flag bills and backed any you know magazine capacity bans assaultments bans he's an anti gunner and
[03:09:34.800 --> 03:09:39.760]  yet he's a new attorney general so trump has him in his ear right now and you've got rubio and you
[03:09:39.760 --> 03:09:44.720]  got graham and other republicans calling for a national red flag bill a national red flag will
[03:09:44.720 --> 03:09:50.160]  bill will be the mechanism for their control and chilling of your speech people on the conservative
[03:09:50.160 --> 03:09:55.040]  right own guns they will use that to do what china's doing now if you don't get in line and don't
[03:09:55.040 --> 03:09:58.880]  say the right things and stay in your box and stay in line they're going to take your guns away and
[03:09:58.880 --> 03:10:03.120]  will chill the speech of millions of gunners across the country and it'll be a ticking time bomb
[03:10:03.120 --> 03:10:08.000]  because every time you go to bed you won't know if that's your night they have a swat team coming
[03:10:08.000 --> 03:10:12.160]  to your house and they'll use it against you the left will use it against so it's oh obviously
[03:10:12.160 --> 03:10:17.280]  they're gonna then as you said swat everybody yeah docks everybody so this is their new level
[03:10:17.280 --> 03:10:21.520]  of harassment don't just take your bank account don't just put up you know signs in your yard
[03:10:21.520 --> 03:10:24.720]  that you're a nazi the equivalent of burning you know crosses in your yard if you're black
[03:10:24.720 --> 03:10:29.600]  yeah you know the democrats have the same old tactics they're just moving on to new ways to
[03:10:29.600 --> 03:10:32.960]  implement them they're gonna swatch you and i'll start with the veterans first any veteran has gone
[03:10:32.960 --> 03:10:38.720]  to the va about being depressed or having ptsd will be instantly on a list they'll go down that
[03:10:38.720 --> 03:10:42.160]  list and say this guy's danger to the community and the democrats have their operatives everywhere
[03:10:42.160 --> 03:10:46.720]  they'll leak those to their own people and move forward with it absolutely it's what's gonna happen
[03:10:46.720 --> 03:10:51.360]  so we have to stop a red flag bill if let trump know that if you if you touch this it's the third
[03:10:51.360 --> 03:10:57.200]  rail it's the real third rail you touch this you're done he has to know how incredibly
[03:10:57.200 --> 03:11:00.160]  restrained nationalist christians conservatives have been
[03:11:02.960 --> 03:11:09.200]  so far right what about small it then we're going to turn this over to papert small it is
[03:11:09.200 --> 03:11:14.880]  the most disingenuous fake person i've ever seen everything he's done is blown up in their face
[03:11:14.880 --> 03:11:21.440]  and still don lemon and others will not not not throw him overboard again that just signals
[03:11:21.440 --> 03:11:26.080]  that the sources i have a right this was all done at higher level direction yeah it wasn't because
[03:11:26.080 --> 03:11:31.440]  he was he was concerned about his salary i believe he's a political operative of the democratic party
[03:11:31.440 --> 03:11:37.200]  and this was all intended to further their agenda to demonize this country and smear the president
[03:11:37.200 --> 03:11:40.880]  and all his followers being racist and he was trying to incite a race where i agree with mike
[03:11:40.880 --> 03:11:45.840]  adams i think that's what was the possible outcome it was very dangerous and so i'm glad to see the
[03:11:45.840 --> 03:11:50.640]  feds go after him on on on a wire fraud and i think they should use that as a mechanism to expand it
[03:11:50.640 --> 03:11:55.280]  in fact i think trump should disappoint the special counsel of his own like mueller on the other side
[03:11:55.280 --> 03:11:59.280]  and go and then dig and find out exactly what his connections were and how high up they go
[03:11:59.280 --> 03:12:05.360]  why would he be so dumb as to pay the guys to write the letter and pay him to go to the hardware
[03:12:05.360 --> 03:12:10.080]  store and then have the cops show up 40 minutes later with a new surround your neck crying with
[03:12:10.080 --> 03:12:16.080]  symmetrical barely cat scratches on your cheeks i mean this was just ridiculously fake he thinks
[03:12:16.080 --> 03:12:23.840]  we're that dumb because we've been asleep he takes our sleeping as our like as our acumen and he also
[03:12:23.840 --> 03:12:28.240]  took for granted that the chicago pd he did not realize that we're going to actually do their
[03:12:28.240 --> 03:12:32.160]  jobs which they did did a pretty good job tracking down really happened i think that caught him by
[03:12:32.160 --> 03:12:37.280]  surprised and his string pullers you see lemon i mean i played this before but lemon saying it's
[03:12:37.280 --> 03:12:43.200]  not his fault this was planned bad and executed bad he says the whoever was handling this screwed
[03:12:43.200 --> 03:12:48.480]  up it's not his fault lemon is on tv admitting he was ordered to do this we was kind of a patsy
[03:12:48.480 --> 03:12:53.040]  right i mean he kind of feels sorry for him he's a low lower level patsy as far as intelligence goes
[03:12:53.920 --> 03:12:59.040]  he is but who's really behind it well so why did they not give him a better job like hey uh
[03:12:59.040 --> 03:13:04.000]  here's a box of masks and use these guys again it just shows how cheap the left always does things
[03:13:04.000 --> 03:13:09.440]  yeah it's a little bit of hubris i think i think he did he underestimated the chicago pd he thought
[03:13:09.440 --> 03:13:13.760]  they truly had them all locked up in their back pocket there would be a show investigation and
[03:13:13.760 --> 03:13:17.280]  into their credit they actually did a real investigation but now it's higher up a slap
[03:13:17.280 --> 03:13:21.200]  on the wrist disorderly conduct well that's that i didn't like that when i first saw that but i guess
[03:13:21.200 --> 03:13:26.160]  they've also tacked on a charge for uh for a false police report as well but they didn't go beyond
[03:13:26.160 --> 03:13:29.760]  that i think the mail fraud is the right way to go as we talked about yesterday there was a chicago
[03:13:29.760 --> 03:13:34.240]  lawyer called in on the show and i was on and talked about how his concern is is that the
[03:13:34.240 --> 03:13:40.240]  prosecutors the lake rank and file prosecutors like the rank and file cops want to go after this guy
[03:13:40.240 --> 03:13:44.880]  but he's concerned that they'll get an order from above when they're higher ups to leave them alone
[03:13:44.880 --> 03:13:53.200]  or be nice to them i don't see how small it did this without help and i'm not involved in the
[03:13:53.200 --> 03:13:57.280]  investigation but the word is they're looking at the people above them at empire and obviously
[03:13:57.280 --> 03:14:01.840]  getting relighted in chicago that i guess they just thought this would go over this way and no one
[03:14:01.840 --> 03:14:06.960]  would dare challenge it i think the establishment's misgaging the atmosphere well it's also if you
[03:14:06.960 --> 03:14:13.120]  said earlier it's also part of their kind of their ethos they they're all on on team demonization
[03:14:13.120 --> 03:14:17.120]  you know team project racism so they won't all want to demonize this country they're all falling
[03:14:17.120 --> 03:14:21.120]  the same playbook it's kind of being a communist back in the 50s and 60s they're all following
[03:14:21.120 --> 03:14:25.600]  you know the edicts of the cometurn national cometurn international cometurn um but they all
[03:14:25.600 --> 03:14:29.680]  did their own um particular way so even if there's not a direct connection he's still part of that
[03:14:29.680 --> 03:14:32.960]  overall plan and that's their strength but it's also their weakness because we can look at their
[03:14:32.960 --> 03:14:38.560]  blueprint and go okay this is what they're like they literally follow like robots yep yeah it's it's
[03:14:38.560 --> 03:14:42.880]  it's the exact same thing if you're a Trump supporter you're white you must be white you can't
[03:14:42.880 --> 03:14:47.040]  be anything else um or if you're if you're not white then you're a race trader but you're all
[03:14:47.040 --> 03:14:51.440]  racist you're all fascist you're all press which is to keep minorities from buying into the american
[03:14:51.440 --> 03:14:55.600]  dream we're saying no you're not allowed to have this you wanted to get here because fragments were
[03:14:55.600 --> 03:14:59.520]  still left but you can't have it yeah which is failing which is why they want to bring in people
[03:14:59.520 --> 03:15:04.560]  they believe will be more amenable to their to their agenda and condition them to hate this country
[03:15:04.560 --> 03:15:08.560]  but that might fail too we'll see all right great job thank you steward rose all right tom

[03:19:45.360 --> 03:19:50.320]  the spirit that i've experienced not these devil worshipers they're cold and failed and
[03:19:50.320 --> 03:20:12.320]  feels like being a tomb i want life i want jesus you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:20:12.320 --> 03:20:22.320]  welcome back to the alex jones show's fourth hour i am tom papper guest hosting for alex jones big
[03:20:22.320 --> 03:20:26.720]  thank you to alex and the info wars team for giving me this opportunity giving me the platform
[03:20:27.280 --> 03:20:32.160]  i want to keep going where alex left off talking about justy smollett and talking about some of
[03:20:32.160 --> 03:20:36.880]  this big tech fascism that we've got going on because i think they really go hand in hand i
[03:20:36.880 --> 03:20:42.880]  mean alex revealed today on the show that he has sources indicating that top republicans top
[03:20:42.880 --> 03:20:47.760]  department of justice officials top fbi officials are investigating smollett we already knew that
[03:20:47.760 --> 03:20:53.840]  the fbi and us postal service are investigating smollett because of alleged mail fraud he sent
[03:20:53.840 --> 03:21:00.480]  the phony uh hate filled letter that had maga at the return address to himself allegedly
[03:21:00.480 --> 03:21:06.800]  but i think that the reason smollett thought he was going to get away with this is because
[03:21:06.800 --> 03:21:13.040]  democrats in general are operating under a different paradigm they think it's still 1995
[03:21:13.040 --> 03:21:17.680]  and they control the narrative and nobody's going to ask questions and of course the chicago police
[03:21:17.680 --> 03:21:23.200]  department did a fantastic job getting to the bottom of this as quickly as they did but i do
[03:21:23.200 --> 03:21:28.960]  wonder if it wasn't for the internet if it wasn't for people like alex jones and info wars and all
[03:21:28.960 --> 03:21:34.560]  of the info warriors out there hammering hammering hammering saying this doesn't seem right this seems
[03:21:34.560 --> 03:21:40.320]  fake this seems like it's not the whole story would the chicago police have been so willing to pursue
[03:21:40.320 --> 03:21:46.640]  it with such vigor i'm not so sure so i think that smollett and his handlers if he has any i think
[03:21:46.640 --> 03:21:52.720]  that they were hoping desperately that americans were still asleep that americans were still stupid
[03:21:52.720 --> 03:21:57.840]  and that's just not true but the thing is they want us to be and that's why they're going after us
[03:21:57.840 --> 03:22:02.480]  online that's why they're going after our bank accounts our paypal account we just had one
[03:22:02.480 --> 03:22:09.600]  of our writers at bigleaguepolitics.com luke rolfing was banned from paypal this guy uses paypal to buy
[03:22:09.600 --> 03:22:17.040]  books he uses paypal to pay his family back he uses paypal for just mundane things but now he's gone
[03:22:17.680 --> 03:22:22.880]  there's no explanation as to why and it just it lines up so well with what's happening with chase
[03:22:22.880 --> 03:22:28.240]  bank terminating anybody who even slightly likes trump or even slightly likes the proud boys you're
[03:22:28.240 --> 03:22:33.680]  no longer allowed to be a chase bank it goes right hand in hand with facebook luke is no longer
[03:22:33.680 --> 03:22:38.240]  allowed on facebook he's no longer allowed on google it's a miracle he's still allowed on twitter
[03:22:38.880 --> 03:22:43.520]  and you see if they get rid of everybody out there who is going to raise up their hand and say
[03:22:43.520 --> 03:22:49.520]  something about this smollett thing doesn't add up if they can get rid of everybody willing to
[03:22:49.520 --> 03:22:54.720]  question authority willing to question the mainstream media narrative then they just might be successful
[03:22:54.720 --> 03:22:59.600]  in pulling off the next hate hoax because if this hate hoax had been successful it is the perfect
[03:22:59.600 --> 03:23:05.840]  story for democrats oh all trump supporters are hate-filled evil people with with the demons in
[03:23:05.840 --> 03:23:10.160]  their hearts and they just go around lynching people at two in the morning and they're homophobic
[03:23:10.160 --> 03:23:15.120]  and they're racist and they hate tv apparently everything bad would have been confirmed and
[03:23:15.120 --> 03:23:20.720]  that's why they hopped on it so quickly that's why we saw kamala harris say that it's a modern
[03:23:20.720 --> 03:23:26.800]  day lynching and we saw kori booker who allegedly is implicated now we saw kori booker going out
[03:23:26.800 --> 03:23:31.840]  and saying we need anti-lynching laws in this country i thought murder was already illegal
[03:23:31.840 --> 03:23:36.480]  but i i don't know maybe i'm wrong on that apparently not for democrats but they would have
[03:23:36.480 --> 03:23:42.800]  been successful if not for the not mainstream media the alternative media patriots all across
[03:23:42.800 --> 03:23:47.600]  the country in the world raising their hand and saying that this doesn't look right so it'll be
[03:23:47.600 --> 03:23:52.560]  exciting to see if we can force the envelope on this make them go a little bit further make them
[03:23:52.560 --> 03:23:59.440]  admit that yes this was a massive hoax and of course jesse does anybody know if we're saying
[03:23:59.440 --> 03:24:02.960]  his name right by the way is it supposed to be juicy small it's i don't know you look at the
[03:24:02.960 --> 03:24:08.000]  rest of his brothers and sisters names and they all have very fascinating names to say the least
[03:24:08.000 --> 03:24:12.960]  but jesse small it has now been written off the rest of this season of empire so it's nice to
[03:24:12.960 --> 03:24:17.440]  see that he has some consequences we all remember just it seems like a few months ago now but i guess
[03:24:17.440 --> 03:24:26.480]  it was longer when rosanne bar lost her own tv show that was named after her because of a supposedly
[03:24:26.480 --> 03:24:32.960]  racist tweet she sent while under medication but smollett yesterday it was reported he was back on
[03:24:32.960 --> 03:24:38.960]  the empire set and now reports today indicate the yes that's true he went back on set and he had been
[03:24:38.960 --> 03:24:44.480]  crying and he was groveling and saying you guys have to believe me i swear to god i didn't do this
[03:24:44.480 --> 03:24:48.240]  i guess he and his maker are gonna have a long discussion when he gets to the pearly gates i
[03:24:48.240 --> 03:24:54.240]  don't know about that claim but he looked like he was going to get off scott free and again
[03:24:54.240 --> 03:24:59.280]  we had a brilliant example of the alternative media coming together i saw articles on info wars
[03:24:59.280 --> 03:25:04.480]  gateway pundit obviously we wrote one at bigleaguepolitics.com saying wait a minute you're
[03:25:04.480 --> 03:25:12.000]  gonna fire this cultural icon rosanne for a tweet but smollett who if this is proven true
[03:25:12.640 --> 03:25:18.480]  did one of the biggest hate hoaxes in modern history he smeared 60 million americans trump
[03:25:18.480 --> 03:25:25.760]  supporters as vile horrific demonic people and not only that the people of chicago are rather
[03:25:25.760 --> 03:25:34.640]  annoyed and rightfully so chicago is a liberal sanctuary it is a utopia for them chicago is
[03:25:34.640 --> 03:25:40.240]  everything that democrats want you have gun control you have democrats in office for 60 or more years
[03:25:40.240 --> 03:25:44.480]  obviously the violent crime rate is through the roof you know they call it shy rack uh because
[03:25:44.480 --> 03:25:48.880]  it actually mirrors the crime rates of shy rack but they consider themselves to be enlightened
[03:25:48.880 --> 03:25:54.800]  liberals there and so for smollett to go in and say that well this was all just mega evil men
[03:25:54.800 --> 03:26:00.400]  in chicago at 2am it really kind of slander the entire town so it's nice to see him get a little
[03:26:00.400 --> 03:26:05.200]  bit of consequences let's read from this a little bit this was at bigleaguepolitics.com earlier today
[03:26:05.200 --> 03:26:11.120]  hate crime hoaxer jesse smollett will not appear in the last two episodes of empire this season
[03:26:11.120 --> 03:26:18.080]  and it's important to point out smollett's bail was $100,000 that's what he gets paid for one
[03:26:18.080 --> 03:26:23.680]  episode of empire so a lot of people are sitting there saying is the judge drunk how on earth does
[03:26:23.680 --> 03:26:28.880]  he think that a hundred thousand dollar bail is anything to a essential hollywood actor just because
[03:26:28.880 --> 03:26:35.040]  he's in chicago he's still a hollywood actor i mean he was arrested in 2007 and pled no contest
[03:26:35.040 --> 03:26:41.840]  for driving with a dui lying to the police and driving with a suspended license while in los
[03:26:41.840 --> 03:26:47.200]  angeles trying to further his acting career so again it's nice to see him get some consequences
[03:26:47.200 --> 03:26:50.640]  i honestly thought he was going to get by scott free because that seems to be the pattern with
[03:26:50.640 --> 03:26:54.960]  democrats you look at hillary clinton you look at all these other names you look at debbie waserman
[03:26:54.960 --> 03:27:01.440]  schultz who hired the two complete hacker losers all of these people get by without any type of
[03:27:01.440 --> 03:27:05.920]  consequences but smollett it looks like he is not going to be in the rest of the season and they're
[03:27:05.920 --> 03:27:11.280]  debating whether or not they even want to have him back on the show at all which again i don't know
[03:27:11.280 --> 03:27:15.760]  who watches empire i'm guessing that's a democrat friendly audience in the first place because i
[03:27:15.760 --> 03:27:22.720]  had never heard of it before smollett came about but just look at what happened to roseanne if they
[03:27:22.720 --> 03:27:28.720]  don't make the right decision if they don't can this guy you're going to get the roseanne treatment
[03:27:28.720 --> 03:27:34.080]  it went from getting the best ratings some of the best tv ratings for a sitcom in modern history
[03:27:34.880 --> 03:27:39.200]  to being now it's the conners you know they murdered roseanne they had her overdose on
[03:27:39.200 --> 03:27:44.800]  prescription painkillers and now it's the conners and it gets maybe half of the audience if they're
[03:27:44.800 --> 03:27:49.120]  lucky if they're lucky they can get half the audience so before we go to break we're running out of
[03:27:49.120 --> 03:27:54.320]  time at this segment i want to remind everybody go to info wars store dot com go buy the products they
[03:27:54.320 --> 03:27:59.520]  are a wonderful wonderful help if you just look at me you know six months ago eight months ago when
[03:27:59.520 --> 03:28:05.360]  i was down in austin sitting next to alex jones i was about 70 pounds heavier and a lot of it i

[03:33:14.400 --> 03:33:24.240]  you are back on the alex jones show's fourth hour i am tom pampered guest hosting for alex big
[03:33:24.240 --> 03:33:29.760]  thanks again to everybody at info wars for giving me this platform to talk today now we were talking
[03:33:29.760 --> 03:33:36.160]  in the last segment about how tech fascism is trying to squeeze out all alternative voices all
[03:33:36.160 --> 03:33:42.800]  independent voices only mainstream people allowed and that does include the likes of daily wire and
[03:33:42.800 --> 03:33:48.080]  others who are pushed forward glenn beck who are pushed forward as the token conservatives but
[03:33:48.080 --> 03:33:53.760]  i want to talk about these ideologically motivated companies chase bank you know their logo looks
[03:33:53.760 --> 03:33:58.480]  like it's a nazi swastika i i don't know why they're allowed to do that you know you post a swastika
[03:33:58.480 --> 03:34:04.720]  on facebook even if you're saying yay we beat the nazis you get banned for 30 days but chase bank
[03:34:04.720 --> 03:34:09.040]  can apparently have a swastika in their logo and it's no big deal but you know we've also been
[03:34:09.040 --> 03:34:13.680]  talking about paypal and of course chase has been a big topic on the show but paypal today
[03:34:13.680 --> 03:34:17.520]  is just they're really rubbing me the wrong way for what they're doing you know it used to be owned
[03:34:17.520 --> 03:34:24.320]  by peter tile a generally intelligent erudite uh you left the trump administration about a year
[03:34:24.320 --> 03:34:29.520]  and a half ago but you know generally a pretty good person from all accounts and now they're
[03:34:29.520 --> 03:34:36.400]  banning reporters who expose them allowing fundraising for illegal immigration caravans this
[03:34:36.400 --> 03:34:41.920]  is up at bigleaguepolitics.com paypal banned big league politics reporter luke rolfing
[03:34:41.920 --> 03:34:47.360]  from its platform mere months after he exposed the online payment processors funding of an
[03:34:47.360 --> 03:34:53.520]  illegal immigration group that provided services to those that encourage illegal immigration and
[03:34:53.520 --> 03:34:59.600]  essentially what luke found out was that paypal which you know you laura lumar can't use it because
[03:34:59.600 --> 03:35:04.720]  she's a nazi she's a jewish nazi that's a new thing now if you didn't know you know the proud
[03:35:04.720 --> 03:35:10.160]  boys can't use it because they're a hate group they're a fraternal society of men that is now hate
[03:35:10.160 --> 03:35:20.720]  men is hate but if you are pueblos seen fronteras people without borders then you can use it to fund
[03:35:20.720 --> 03:35:27.440]  migrant caravans coming into the united states that is what paypal is being used for big league
[03:35:27.440 --> 03:35:32.720]  politics first discovered this in may of last year when some of the first caravans were making
[03:35:32.720 --> 03:35:37.760]  their arduous march in i say arduous you know they all had trucks they all had vans they
[03:35:37.760 --> 03:35:42.080]  seemed to have air conditioning nobody died they were all wearing the bare minimum of clothing
[03:35:42.080 --> 03:35:47.600]  it was a little bit confusing those caravans but we've now seen maybe why they had some of that
[03:35:47.600 --> 03:35:51.600]  stuff and it's because paypal was allowing them to collect funds using their platform we've reached
[03:35:51.600 --> 03:35:56.480]  out to paypal we never heard a response in fact it was luke who did the original article luke
[03:35:56.480 --> 03:36:01.600]  then did a follow-up article just four months ago saying yep paypal's still at it and the very first
[03:36:01.600 --> 03:36:07.200]  communication he had from paypal was simply telling him that his account was gone that he
[03:36:07.200 --> 03:36:13.840]  could no longer use it and in their explanation of why luke lost his account they said it was
[03:36:13.840 --> 03:36:20.320]  because of the activities he did the activities that he did using the account you know like paying
[03:36:20.320 --> 03:36:27.120]  for dinner you know like buying books that is apparently bad activities when it comes to amazon
[03:36:27.120 --> 03:36:31.760]  now he actually got one of their people in their chat support system to respond to him
[03:36:32.320 --> 03:36:38.000]  and he said well what made you decide to do this did the splc go yell at you and say that you need
[03:36:38.000 --> 03:36:44.400]  to ban me because i'm a reporter and this is how she responded for more details regarding the why
[03:36:44.400 --> 03:36:50.160]  in all caps of this action that paypal took regarding your account you may submit a subpoena
[03:36:50.160 --> 03:36:55.520]  to our corporate office she's literally saying if you want to know why you're not allowed to do
[03:36:55.520 --> 03:37:00.720]  business with what what is essentially an online bank if you want to know why that is
[03:37:00.720 --> 03:37:06.960]  you're gonna have to sue us and so luke uh luke has friends luke has been a journalist for a few
[03:37:06.960 --> 03:37:11.360]  years now so he's made some connections and he said fine we'll see you in court i'll tell my
[03:37:11.360 --> 03:37:16.960]  lawyer to do exactly that so it will be interesting to see how this goes but i find it again fascinating
[03:37:17.600 --> 03:37:22.160]  that the only way we get a response is when they shut us down when we ask them how come
[03:37:22.160 --> 03:37:28.160]  you're endorsing illegal immigration how come you are letting people contribute to lawlessness
[03:37:28.160 --> 03:37:34.480]  how come you are defying president trump how can you are defying the law crickets only when they
[03:37:34.480 --> 03:37:38.720]  ban us do we actually have a back and forth conversation with paypal and you know as somebody
[03:37:38.720 --> 03:37:42.640]  who has an online website and i know alex jones has been through this with info wars store dot
[03:37:42.640 --> 03:37:50.000]  com info wars life dot com it is a bit terrifying to think of paypal going away and you look at
[03:37:50.000 --> 03:37:56.240]  1776 dot shop where you can get the roger stone did nothing wrong shirt you look at infowarstore.com
[03:37:56.240 --> 03:38:02.080]  and you can see that more payment processors are coming out and i'm hoping you know this may be a
[03:38:02.080 --> 03:38:05.920]  little bit naive of me because look what they did with gab they started going after their domain
[03:38:05.920 --> 03:38:09.680]  registrar and they started going after their hosting provider and they go after this and they
[03:38:09.680 --> 03:38:13.680]  go after that and they can get them out of the app store just like they did with the alex jones
[03:38:13.680 --> 03:38:18.720]  info wars official app you're just not allowed to be part of their system but there are payment
[03:38:18.720 --> 03:38:22.720]  processors coming out that are now patriot friendly and that does give me a little bit
[03:38:22.720 --> 03:38:29.280]  of peace of mind but this is why it's so important to go to the stores to if you like me go support
[03:38:29.280 --> 03:38:34.160]  me if you like alex go support alex because they are squeezing us out people have been
[03:38:34.160 --> 03:38:41.920]  seeing paypal as the go to safe way to pay for over a decade now i imagine and now suddenly
[03:38:41.920 --> 03:38:46.480]  it's being removed from websites it's being people are told they can no longer collect
[03:38:46.480 --> 03:38:53.440]  donations using paypal it's a bit scary it's a bit scary for those of us who are kind of small
[03:38:53.440 --> 03:39:00.720]  businesses doing this but of course it's not just paypal chase bank you all saw martina
[03:39:01.280 --> 03:39:07.680]  marcota on the show earlier today with alex i'm sure but she joins proud boys chairman and rike
[03:39:07.680 --> 03:39:16.400]  torio being banned off the platform and of course and rike has a he's also the individual who runs 1776
[03:39:16.400 --> 03:39:23.760]  shops so he does not need paypal let it be known but this is absolute financial fascism from a
[03:39:23.760 --> 03:39:28.400]  company that has a swastika as its logo a lot of people say i don't know it looks kind of like one
[03:39:28.400 --> 03:39:33.120]  to me let's just read a little bit from our article that we have up here at bigleaguepolitics.com
[03:39:33.120 --> 03:39:38.080]  conservative commentator and former burlesque dancer martina marcota has joined an elite
[03:39:38.080 --> 03:39:42.720]  list of trump supporters who have had their chase bank accounts shut down in recent weeks
[03:39:43.280 --> 03:39:48.160]  this includes proud boys chairman and rike torio and trump supporting army veteran former info
[03:39:48.160 --> 03:39:54.160]  wars veteran i might add as well joe bigs who had their chase bank accounts shut down in recent
[03:39:54.160 --> 03:40:00.800]  weeks you know i know that it's a little bit of a cliche at this point to say you know democrats
[03:40:00.800 --> 03:40:09.520]  are the real nazis but it's absolutely 200 true what do you think was going on in 1939 they made
[03:40:09.520 --> 03:40:14.960]  it impossible for everybody that they didn't like from jews to gypsies to gays they made it
[03:40:14.960 --> 03:40:19.120]  impossible for them to engage in commerce they made it impossible for them to rent that's why
[03:40:19.120 --> 03:40:26.320]  they had to live in ghettos this is the totalitarian fascist playbook and we're seeing it a little bit
[03:40:26.320 --> 03:40:32.400]  different this time you know the one good thing about the nazis is you kill hitler and they're
[03:40:32.400 --> 03:40:36.400]  gone you invade and they're gone and of course i would never recommend violence in a million years
[03:40:37.280 --> 03:40:42.400]  i don't think that that is how we get out of this because this is different this is kafka
[03:40:42.400 --> 03:40:48.960]  ask because it's not the government that's putting its boot down on our neck it's these bigger than
[03:40:48.960 --> 03:40:54.560]  government corporations it's these bigger than government banks that have half the government
[03:40:54.560 --> 03:41:00.960]  paid off they get to do whatever they want with no repercussions and it's really you know you go
[03:41:00.960 --> 03:41:05.040]  and you try to appeal something if it's the government you know what channels to go through
[03:41:05.040 --> 03:41:10.720]  even a totalitarian government you know what channels to go through to get your paypal account
[03:41:10.720 --> 03:41:16.640]  to get a little bit of a hey what happened here an explanation you have to sue them they openly
[03:41:16.640 --> 03:41:21.360]  invite you to sue them i'm sure it's the same with chase bank if you want to get some answers
[03:41:21.360 --> 03:41:27.360]  as to why your chase bank account is no longer allowed to exist the only option is quite literally
[03:41:27.360 --> 03:41:31.440]  a lawsuit and the average person doesn't have the money for this you know on the internet a lot of
[03:41:31.440 --> 03:41:35.840]  people like to say well then sue him get a lawyer and sue him you're talking tens or possibly hundreds
[03:41:35.840 --> 03:41:42.240]  of thousand dollars to get any type of response from this stuff it is frankly a bit fascinating you
[03:41:42.240 --> 03:41:48.800]  can see right there on screen alex jones is part of this and he is suing paypal and i can only imagine
[03:41:48.800 --> 03:41:52.800]  the legal costs associated with all this and again i hate to plug so much for alex but
[03:41:52.800 --> 03:41:56.880]  he says he doesn't do it so maybe the guesthouse have to do it for him that is why we need your
[03:41:56.880 --> 03:42:01.680]  support because we're not allowed to make money the only way we can make money is if you go to
[03:42:01.680 --> 03:42:06.080]  infowarstore.com or if you go to my website or if you go to if you like gavin mcginnis if you like
[03:42:06.080 --> 03:42:10.880]  the proud boys go to 1776.shop even though of course gavin is no longer affiliated with the
[03:42:10.880 --> 03:42:16.640]  proud boys very important distinction there so this is the fourth hour of the alex jones show
[03:42:16.640 --> 03:42:21.840]  i'm tom papper filling in for alex today thanks again to everybody for giving me this opportunity
[03:42:21.840 --> 03:42:26.400]  thank you to watching for watching i should say we will be back with one or two more segments

[03:42:41.920 --> 03:42:49.600]  world we'll be right back this is the alex jones show i'm tom papper defending the republic from
[03:42:49.600 --> 03:43:06.560]  enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones by leaps and by bounds the number one best-selling
[03:43:06.560 --> 03:43:12.880]  supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements but they are riddled with
[03:43:12.880 --> 03:43:18.480]  dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but
[03:43:18.480 --> 03:43:23.600]  burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects we have developed hands down from our
[03:43:23.600 --> 03:43:31.040]  research the most powerful healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world there's
[03:43:31.040 --> 03:43:36.800]  nothing else like it must experience it it is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use
[03:43:36.800 --> 03:43:41.840]  packets to mix in fruit juice or water whatever you'd like warning though it's very very strong

[03:46:53.680 --> 03:47:23.600]  welcome back to the fourth hour of the alex jones show i am tom papper
[03:47:23.600 --> 03:47:28.560]  guest hosting today facebook's gone in for trump now we were talking in the last couple segments
[03:47:28.560 --> 03:47:33.120]  we've been talking about empire it's still the topic of the day and i would be remiss if i didn't
[03:47:33.120 --> 03:47:38.080]  tell you guys a little bit about what happens when you give the leftist some cognitive dissonance
[03:47:38.080 --> 03:47:43.920]  when you break through their mental conditioning and let them see a glimpse of the truth apparently
[03:47:43.920 --> 03:47:50.400]  it is complete chaos on the set of empire or at least it was yesterday before they finally decided
[03:47:50.400 --> 03:47:56.640]  to suspend excuse to suspend i should say smollett this is from breitbart nullty empire cast feel
[03:47:56.640 --> 03:48:04.480]  betrayed want jesse smollett fired we've been told many of the empire actors are bleeping furious
[03:48:05.280 --> 03:48:10.720]  and feel fox haunchos if they don't fire jesse he should quit on his own because he doesn't
[03:48:10.720 --> 03:48:17.920]  deserve a spot on the show now there are still people who are somehow still defending this guy
[03:48:17.920 --> 03:48:23.680]  which is a little bit beyond me and that is the absolute states of leftist conditioning
[03:48:23.680 --> 03:48:28.400]  they refuse to believe the truth even when it's right in front of them i mean obviously the case
[03:48:28.400 --> 03:48:34.320]  is still proceeding by some miracle jesse could be innocent who the hell knows i don't see that
[03:48:34.320 --> 03:48:38.320]  happening in this timeline but let's let's read just a little bit more here the feelings from
[03:48:38.320 --> 03:48:45.520]  animosity stem from the fact that everyone on set had jesse's back after the attack in quotes
[03:48:45.520 --> 03:48:50.800]  but in light of the new evidence police have laid out many of them feel hurt and embarrassed
[03:48:51.440 --> 03:48:55.840]  tmz adds that almost everyone is worried about how smollett's hate crime hoax will hurt the
[03:48:55.840 --> 03:49:04.240]  reputation of the show and how it could continue to do so if he remains part of the cast now it
[03:49:04.240 --> 03:49:10.880]  is interesting to see the one thing that leftists have is a healthy interest in self-preservation
[03:49:10.880 --> 03:49:15.360]  many of them probably couldn't care less about the 60 million americans who were smeared as
[03:49:15.360 --> 03:49:21.120]  racist homophobic losers by smollett many of them probably couldn't care less that smollett
[03:49:21.120 --> 03:49:26.240]  essentially said that chicago has this horrible racist problem you know the one thing chicago
[03:49:26.240 --> 03:49:31.360]  doesn't have gun violence yes corruption yes but i really don't think they have a horrible horrible
[03:49:31.360 --> 03:49:38.800]  racist problem in shirac but these actors are more interested in their own self-preservation
[03:49:38.800 --> 03:49:44.880]  their career their future how's it gonna impact me what's gonna happen to me because of smollett's
[03:49:44.880 --> 03:49:50.080]  lies alleged lies i suppose i should say smollett has already been cut of course from last two
[03:49:50.080 --> 03:49:55.200]  remaining episodes of the season that's one hundred thousand dollars per episode one must
[03:49:55.200 --> 03:50:00.240]  wonder if smollett was counting on that money to pay his bail or not of course uh hundred
[03:50:00.240 --> 03:50:05.360]  thousand dollar bail you got out on a bond which is ten percent of the episode ten thousand dollars
[03:50:05.360 --> 03:50:11.760]  what smollett makes in a couple hours of working is what his current price of freedom is i i do
[03:50:11.760 --> 03:50:16.640]  wonder what that judge is thinking there maybe they don't realize how much hollywood actors are paid
[03:50:16.640 --> 03:50:23.280]  i don't know and by the way what an inflated number i just coming from a tv background kctu tv
[03:50:23.280 --> 03:50:29.120]  five is here in wichita kansas uh infowars affiliate very proud to have a great signal down here but
[03:50:29.120 --> 03:50:35.680]  what an inflated number you know if it wasn't for the dying media being prompt up in so many
[03:50:35.680 --> 03:50:39.920]  different ways there is no way they could afford to pay these actors this insane amount of money but
[03:50:39.920 --> 03:50:47.440]  and again i think that perhaps sheriff clark is dead on the target when he says that this
[03:50:47.440 --> 03:50:53.840]  couldn't have been about money because smollett is at this point making one point eight million
[03:50:53.840 --> 03:51:00.560]  dollars per season and the story that we're told by police is that he's not happy with that he needs
[03:51:00.560 --> 03:51:06.000]  more money that's that's not enough for him he needs a little bit more and so he does this hate
[03:51:06.000 --> 03:51:10.960]  hoax allegedly and i just find that hard to believe personally how much money do you need maybe what
[03:51:10.960 --> 03:51:16.160]  he's doing is he's doing one of these leftist things of looking at one of his uh better respected
[03:51:16.160 --> 03:51:22.560]  more uh popular co-stars and he's saying why isn't that me why aren't i making that money i would
[03:51:22.560 --> 03:51:26.880]  believe if that's the case that jesse does seem the type but let's keep reading according to a
[03:51:26.880 --> 03:51:32.320]  thursday report after being arrested and formally charged with a felony for filing a false report
[03:51:32.320 --> 03:51:38.800]  that afternoon smollett who was out on bail returned to the empire set where he apologized for all
[03:51:38.800 --> 03:51:44.480]  the trouble and pleaded with everyone to believe he did not fabricate the hoax he said this i'm
[03:51:44.480 --> 03:51:50.320]  sorry i put you all through this and not answered my calls i wanted to say i'm sorry and you know me
[03:51:50.320 --> 03:51:58.320]  i would never do this to you your family i swear to god i did not do this you know the way those
[03:51:58.320 --> 03:52:04.320]  brothers rolled on him i don't know maybe smollett is not a christian but that is uh not the time
[03:52:04.320 --> 03:52:11.520]  to swear to god when you have two witnesses brothers who what is he accusing them of that these two
[03:52:11.520 --> 03:52:19.360]  men of nigerian descent that they just blatantly lied to the police why would they do that why would
[03:52:19.360 --> 03:52:24.160]  the why would the brothers do that and smollett is basically saying you know it's the brothers
[03:52:24.160 --> 03:52:28.720]  who put forward the narrative that they were paid thirty five hundred dollars by smollett to do this
[03:52:28.720 --> 03:52:35.040]  crime and that they would be paid another five hundred dollars after their impromptu vacation
[03:52:35.040 --> 03:52:42.320]  to nigeria and istanbul and elsewhere and it is the phone records between smollett and the
[03:52:42.320 --> 03:52:47.600]  brothers that the police are using to help connect the dots it is the prior text messages
[03:52:47.600 --> 03:52:55.040]  exchange where smollett allegedly bought molly or ecstasy from the brothers they were there his
[03:52:55.040 --> 03:53:01.200]  drug dealers allegedly so what is smollett saying here that these guys are lying that the phone
[03:53:01.200 --> 03:53:06.480]  records are just a coincidence that the fact that they were extras on set and had a personal
[03:53:06.480 --> 03:53:11.920]  relationship with smollett it's all just a coincidence and the fact that people on the
[03:53:11.920 --> 03:53:17.600]  empire said believe this is truly astounding by the way smollett because he was being overwhelmed
[03:53:17.600 --> 03:53:21.840]  with phone calls from people asking him about this he had actually turned off his number
[03:53:21.840 --> 03:53:28.720]  and got a new phone number he was that uh that busy trying to dodge people and i all i do wonder
[03:53:28.720 --> 03:53:33.920]  this is my own personal theory that's not grounded in anything but did he think that if he got a new
[03:53:33.920 --> 03:53:39.040]  number then police wouldn't be able to find some of the old data i don't know but it is absolutely
[03:53:39.040 --> 03:53:43.920]  beautiful the tension within box about how to handle smollett the article continues
[03:53:43.920 --> 03:53:48.720]  is highlighted by the fact that the actor is well liked among the network and studio brass
[03:53:48.720 --> 03:53:53.520]  well maybe they should have paid him more that's apparently the reason for all of this
[03:53:53.520 --> 03:53:58.080]  so in the last segment we've got a few minutes left here on the fourth hour the alex jones show in
[03:53:58.080 --> 03:54:04.160]  the last segment we talked about big tech fascism squeezing out the little man and it's not just big
[03:54:04.160 --> 03:54:09.680]  tech this is the left's culture this is what they do they want us gone they want us removed from
[03:54:09.680 --> 03:54:14.480]  not just public discourse but if they could get their way the face of the earth and it's not just
[03:54:14.480 --> 03:54:21.520]  in america in the united kingdom a student was kicked out of a university after branding hello meat
[03:54:21.520 --> 03:54:27.600]  the type of meat that muslims have to eat as barbaric and inhumane and if you don't know
[03:54:27.600 --> 03:54:35.360]  how hello meat is processed is that the right word prepared maybe they butcher an animal
[03:54:35.360 --> 03:54:41.600]  while it is alive not stunned no type of sedation no type of anything they slit its throat and let
[03:54:41.600 --> 03:54:49.600]  the blood drain onto the ground if pita had any guts whatsoever they wouldn't be releasing god
[03:54:49.600 --> 03:54:54.400]  awful videos trying to convince americans not to drink milk they would be putting their entire
[03:54:54.400 --> 03:55:00.960]  budget into stopping halal slaughter but no that would be racist that would be anti diversity so
[03:55:00.960 --> 03:55:05.680]  this kid has now been kicked out of university he's 19 years old he's a member of the u-kit party
[03:55:06.880 --> 03:55:12.080]  he's now been kicked out of university until next september when the next academic cycle starts
[03:55:12.080 --> 03:55:17.680]  and the only way he can get back in september is if he goes to a diversity training class
[03:55:18.640 --> 03:55:23.520]  this is the future of america i think this is where we're headed if we're not very very careful
[03:55:23.520 --> 03:55:31.280]  and if we don't really start to push back in every nonviolent way we can and further in the future
[03:55:31.280 --> 03:55:37.280]  say another six months to a year beyond that is what's happening in china they have officially
[03:55:37.280 --> 03:55:45.120]  unrolled the new social credit scoring system in china and gateway pundit posits is america next
[03:55:45.840 --> 03:55:52.720]  now they also add america already has a social credit score just ask laura lumar who's unofficial
[03:55:52.720 --> 03:55:58.400]  social credit score led chase bank to cut ties with her paypal to cut ties with her facebook to
[03:55:58.400 --> 03:56:04.000]  cut ties with her twitter to cut ties with her the only place you can still find laura lumar is on
[03:56:04.000 --> 03:56:09.280]  instagram which seems to be the forgotten one i shouldn't probably say this because then they'll
[03:56:09.280 --> 03:56:13.600]  go find it and get him i'm not even going to say it but there are people who are banned from other
[03:56:13.600 --> 03:56:21.040]  platforms still on instagram we'll leave it there and the chinese because it's so hard to get people
[03:56:21.040 --> 03:56:28.080]  to parrot their fake news talking points and that are actual human breathing newsmen they are actually
[03:56:28.080 --> 03:56:34.720]  creating npcs non playable characters to read their news this is a bit of a comical article we've
[03:56:34.720 --> 03:56:38.480]  got to go fast we're running out of time here on the fourth hour of the alex jones show but hundreds
[03:56:38.480 --> 03:56:43.840]  of journalists reacted with indignation when well-wishers urged them to learn to code in response
[03:56:43.840 --> 03:56:50.240]  to a round of firings well the chinese have beat them to it not only do their journalists know how
[03:56:50.240 --> 03:56:55.440]  to code their journalists have coded an ai journalist that will read the news for them
[03:56:55.440 --> 03:57:02.240]  it's a fascinating development and i do think you know hey you can program a program to lie you can
[03:57:02.240 --> 03:57:10.080]  code this fake guy to lie that's not difficult at all that's an easy thing to do we had more time
[03:57:10.080 --> 03:57:14.080]  we might play that video but we are running out of time here in the fourth hour of the alex jones
