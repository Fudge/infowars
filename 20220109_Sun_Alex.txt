[00:00.000 --> 00:25.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:25.000 --> 00:35.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're now into the year 2022, nine days in.
[00:35.000 --> 00:42.000]  And it's official, all over the world, the UN is directing internment camps
[00:42.000 --> 00:47.000]  that hold people for months if they misbehave when they're taken there
[00:47.000 --> 00:52.000]  for their five to 14 day quarantines, when they're not even positive for COVID.
[00:52.000 --> 00:57.000]  If you're bad, you now stay a month, is the UN guideline.
[00:57.000 --> 01:03.000]  And they've introduced bills that are very close to passing in 11 states.
[01:03.000 --> 01:09.000]  New York, Washington state, Oregon, you name it.
[01:09.000 --> 01:13.000]  To hold you for 30 days per infraction.
[01:13.000 --> 01:17.000]  You kind of get how this works, right? You never get out.
[01:17.000 --> 01:24.000]  Oh, and it deputizes anybody the Democrats want to with law enforcement powers.
[01:24.000 --> 01:33.000]  Not under the elected sheriff who has that power constitutionally under the health department.
[01:33.000 --> 01:39.000]  Remember, Obama said we need a domestic security force just as big and just as strong as our military.
[01:39.000 --> 01:45.000]  And the Dr. Ryan last year from the UN said the UN goals have all local governments go into the houses
[01:45.000 --> 01:54.000]  and take the children away.
[01:54.000 --> 02:00.000]  So that's where we are.
[02:00.000 --> 02:07.000]  And it dovetails with the announcements in Politico and the Washington Post and CNN
[02:07.000 --> 02:14.000]  and scores of other establishment publications this weekend said we're in a civil war.
[02:14.000 --> 02:21.000]  And now the Democrat talking point is we want to kill the conservatives and the Trump supporters.
[02:21.000 --> 02:24.000]  I've got the news.
[02:24.000 --> 02:26.000]  Just like that.
[02:26.000 --> 02:33.000]  Now we knew they were training for civil war years ago and actually teaching that in their underground
[02:33.000 --> 02:36.000]  Democrat publications that were getting wide distribution by Soros.
[02:36.000 --> 02:40.000]  And there was a lot of media attacked me in 2017, 18, 19.
[02:40.000 --> 02:47.000]  Oh, but now they say it's true and I have the articles all right here to remind people this is the system making its big move.
[02:47.000 --> 02:49.000]  And why?
[02:49.000 --> 02:54.000]  Because they're getting ready to collapse the world economy by design.
[02:54.000 --> 03:00.000]  And all over the world, whether you're in Australia or in Spain or in Canada or in a blue city,
[03:00.000 --> 03:07.000]  which is occupied by globalist forces literally like a foreign army.
[03:07.000 --> 03:10.000]  They have to get you ready for the total collapse.
[03:10.000 --> 03:18.000]  And that's why they're rolling out martial law with the training wheels that it's all being done to protect you from COVID.
[03:18.000 --> 03:24.000]  And that's why they lie with a unified voice worldwide with fake numbers, fake statistics over and over again.
[03:24.000 --> 03:26.000]  Lie and tell you it's a vaccine when it's not.
[03:26.000 --> 03:29.000]  Lie and tell you it gives you 100% protection when it doesn't.
[03:29.000 --> 03:31.000]  Then they tell you it gives you no protection.
[03:31.000 --> 03:32.000]  You got to have another shot.
[03:32.000 --> 03:34.000]  You're not allowed to criticize it or you get banned.
[03:34.000 --> 03:41.000]  Now they're passing laws all over the world to arrest people that go out and protest or criticize or speak out.
[03:41.000 --> 03:50.000]  Because the pandemic would end if you just shut up and accept martial law and accept your vaccine passport and accept unlimited shots.
[03:50.000 --> 03:57.000]  If you'll just accept the government and big pharma run by the UN putting in your body what they want, when they want.
[03:57.000 --> 04:03.000]  But if you don't do what they say, Obama will send his domestic security force to get you.
[04:03.000 --> 04:12.000]  You know who's in his third term right now, Barack Hussein Obama. Here it is.
[04:12.000 --> 04:20.000]  We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've set.
[04:20.000 --> 04:32.000]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[04:32.000 --> 04:41.000]  Today you video from the outgoing Obama five and a half years ago at the UN within Attorney General Loretta Lynch
[04:41.000 --> 04:48.000]  and they had tears in their eyes with Henry Kissinger as they announced the U.S. cities, Democrats of every major city,
[04:48.000 --> 05:01.000]  were now under UN control under the Strong Cities Initiative and that they would be implementing the abolishment of the police and the rise of their new paramilitary force.
[05:01.000 --> 05:11.000]  Because 2021 is gone, it's in the rearview mirror, but you can still take advantage of Christmas prices going to the new year at infowarstore.com.

[06:12.000 --> 06:21.000]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[06:21.000 --> 06:31.000]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen to this live Sunday, January 9th, 2022 transmission, very grave times, ladies and gentlemen.
[06:31.000 --> 06:45.000]  But America still exists, freedom still exists, and outposts of telling the truth are still on air, despite the fact that the globalists are shutting down the old republic, shutting down the basic freedoms and liberties,
[06:45.000 --> 06:52.000]  and jumping the train to the other tracks of absolute despotism and oppression.
[06:52.000 --> 07:00.000]  So we are in very, very dangerous dark times. The live show headline at infowarstore.com says it all.
[07:00.000 --> 07:17.000]  I'm going to show you that headline on air right now. Sunday Live, US COVID camps coming online as Biden pushes forward with vaccine mandate, forced injection mandate.
[07:17.000 --> 07:28.000]  COVID totalitarianism is accelerating despite pushback against their draconian measures across the world.
[07:28.000 --> 07:44.000]  The important thing to note here, in amongst all of this, is that meanwhile, Democrat deep state mouthpieces have announced that America is officially in a civil war,
[07:44.000 --> 07:54.000]  as the cover for declaring martial law and completing America's journey into tyranny.
[07:54.000 --> 08:02.000]  You don't have to hear about Alex Jones tell you about it 25 years ago, or five years ago anymore, or six months ago. It's all here.
[08:02.000 --> 08:12.000]  Let me just read you a couple of headlines. Another blue state announces plans for a strike force right out of the UN Directives.
[08:12.000 --> 08:20.000]  These are quotes to involuntarily detain the unvaccinated. That's the GMO gene therapy.
[08:20.000 --> 08:27.000]  That story is on infowars.com and is so incredibly important.
[08:27.000 --> 08:38.000]  Here's another one. Mill filed in Washington would authorize strike force to involuntarily detain unvaccinated families.
[08:38.000 --> 08:48.000]  They have already set up the quote internment camps is the quote. They would use the term internment camp, you know, where Novak Djokovic is being held right now.
[08:48.000 --> 08:55.000]  He said, oh, come on in. You got natural immunity. Yeah, that's good. You can come to Australia. You're locked up now for 14 days in a literal fleabag.
[08:55.000 --> 09:03.000]  There's literally fleas in there. He says biting. That's the punishment. Oh, but all the globalists on their private jets, they're all exempt.
[09:03.000 --> 09:12.000]  Of course, they're part of the global blue pass initiative of the UN. They're all exempt.
[09:12.000 --> 09:19.000]  And that ties into this bill right here, which, by the way, sponsored by Bill Gates and was even introduced before the COVID release.
[09:19.000 --> 09:27.000]  Procedures for Isolation Quarantine, the bill, WAC 246-100-040.
[09:27.000 --> 09:34.000]  Oh, and look all over the news. It's even being announced all over local Austin radio where I live.
[09:34.000 --> 09:40.000]  I was just trying to listen to local radio this weekend summon three times, even caught it on video once.
[09:40.000 --> 09:45.000]  They just announced the National Guard is going to be on the streets. The military is getting you used to it.
[09:45.000 --> 09:51.000]  I'm not against the military. I'm against it being used in a medical, tyranny, biomedical security state.
[09:51.000 --> 09:59.000]  And here it is. National guards step into alleviate pressure on hospitals overwhelmed by Omicron Wave.
[09:59.000 --> 10:03.000]  But really, they're overwhelmed by firing up to a third of the nurses and doctors nationwide.
[10:03.000 --> 10:09.000]  That's the real reason when you dig into the actual legislative hearings and things, but they tell you it's Omicron.
[10:09.000 --> 10:18.000]  But there's this new super cold all over the world that's killing people in record who happen to be double and triple faxed, even the BBC admits.
[10:18.000 --> 10:24.000]  That's just a mystery illness, NPR says. We don't know why their own bodies are attacking them and eating holes in them.
[10:24.000 --> 10:32.000]  It's called ADE, antibody dependency enhancement, and that's what the top scientists all warned almost two years ago would happen.
[10:32.000 --> 10:38.000]  Isn't it interesting? Oh, but other countries, their camps are bad, though. Our camps are good.
[10:38.000 --> 10:47.000]  Some escape by paying bribes, cross rivers, risk lives to return to Kim Jong-un's North Korea.
[10:47.000 --> 10:52.000]  Oh my gosh, it's an article about how great Kim Jong-un is and how it's wonderful living a camp.
[10:52.000 --> 11:00.000]  That's out of Yahoo News. All part of the gaslighting, everyone, ladies and gentlemen. All part of the lies.
[11:00.000 --> 11:05.000]  And that ties in with this. The world economy is being collapsed by design.
[11:05.000 --> 11:14.000]  The powerful private central banks are issuing themselves unlimited Chinese currency, European Union currency, United States currency.
[11:14.000 --> 11:23.000]  And it's all being devalued at record rate while they buy up infrastructure and real companies and patents and raw land and resources.
[11:23.000 --> 11:31.000]  And then you're going to be left, I'm going to be left, holding the bag of hyperinflation and devalued currencies with greater debt.
[11:31.000 --> 11:40.000]  For all at a Weimar Republic level. And as the political cover, that's why they've primed on all the news and TV and movies we know from the WikiLeaks.
[11:40.000 --> 11:48.000]  I mean, I could watch the propaganda and tell you what they're doing, so can you, but they admit in the WikiLeaks from five and a half years ago when it came out
[11:48.000 --> 11:56.000]  that the left was working with the establishment and the media and big tech to create cultural division
[11:56.000 --> 12:04.000]  to have that be the cover for the new order they're launching on the ashes of the collapsed nation and world.
[12:04.000 --> 12:11.000]  The great reset, the build back better. And that's what's frustrating is there's the plan all right there in the open.
[12:11.000 --> 12:18.000]  So I told you that before they launched this financial collapse and the great reset, we were talking about Klaus Schwab and the rest of it
[12:18.000 --> 12:24.000]  20 years ago before anybody else was because he's the head of the Bilderberg Group too. That's the most powerful group they run at all.
[12:24.000 --> 12:29.000]  He's the head of it. He's the head manager of it. It gets the globals together once a year.
[12:29.000 --> 12:34.000]  But they have scaring meetings every quarter or so in secret locations.
[12:34.000 --> 12:43.000]  Some of those minutes leaked from a Rockefeller, Bill Gates, Ted Turner, George Soros, Oprah Winfrey meeting 13 years ago.
[12:43.000 --> 12:48.000]  And we're talking about forced depopulation through vaccines.
[12:48.000 --> 12:54.000]  Oh, that's Wall Street Journal. And here you are 13 years later. You're living it.
[12:54.000 --> 12:59.000]  You will own nothing. You will have nothing. You will drink sewage water. You will eat bugs.
[12:59.000 --> 13:05.000]  That's what they say. And they're just telling you and laughing at you once they collapse the original old economy
[13:05.000 --> 13:10.000]  and force you onto the nightmare new economy that they have prepared.
[13:10.000 --> 13:17.000]  So here's some of the headlines right here. Remember all these?
[13:17.000 --> 13:20.000]  Here's one out of the Washington Post.
[13:20.000 --> 13:25.000]  A short history of Alex Jones claiming that the left was about to start a second civil war.
[13:25.000 --> 13:35.000]  Not to detail exactly how they're going to do it and use the economic collapse with race war and sectarian violence and left-right violence as the cover.
[13:35.000 --> 13:38.000]  Oh, that didn't age well for the Washington Post, did it?
[13:38.000 --> 13:47.000]  A civil war post by a right-wing radio host, roundly mocked on Twitter, July 4th, 2018. Isn't it funny?
[13:47.000 --> 13:54.000]  Second civil war letters. Alex Jones conspiracy ignites a parody conflict.
[13:54.000 --> 14:01.000]  With talk of civil war, America enters Alex Jones' wheelhouse. Oh, that's what they're now having to do.
[14:01.000 --> 14:04.000]  And here's the news today. This is just a few of them.
[14:04.000 --> 14:11.000]  We are in a civil war. Oh, because the CIA said two weeks ago officially run by the Carnegie Endowment that controls this.
[14:11.000 --> 14:14.000]  And so that's why I said get ready now in a couple of weeks. They're getting their marching orders.
[14:14.000 --> 14:20.000]  The news will now announce we're in a civil war officially and tell you who the good guys are, the globalists, the offshore banks, the communist Chinese,
[14:20.000 --> 14:24.000]  who are the bad guys, the Christians, the conservatives, the white people, the gun owners.
[14:24.000 --> 14:29.000]  And again for divide and conquer. Oh, you didn't know the white's your enemy, so we all fight each other and they win.
[14:29.000 --> 14:38.000]  That's right. We're in a new civil war. And then the London Guardian is the U.S. really heading for a second civil war?
[14:38.000 --> 14:47.000]  Oh, that's out today. Dozens of these I saw all over TV just getting you ready for the financial collapse that they've already implemented.
[14:47.000 --> 14:53.000]  We're already in the middle of. And as we're collapsing, then they just have race war and division and blaming on local police.
[14:53.000 --> 14:59.000]  And then their cities burn and then confidence implodes and the IMF and World Bank and private families come in.
[14:59.000 --> 15:04.000]  Like then all over the world other nations and buy up everything pennies on the dollar with all the fiat currency they've got.
[15:04.000 --> 15:09.000]  And then you get a global social credit score on your phone where if you don't behave like they want and do what they want,
[15:09.000 --> 15:12.000]  take all the shots they want and pay the carbon taxes they want.
[15:12.000 --> 15:18.000]  Well, the new paramilitary police because they're firing all the regular police and creating those that have sworn allegiance
[15:18.000 --> 15:24.000]  to the globalist that domestic security force Obama talked about that just as big and just as strong as our military.
[15:24.000 --> 15:29.000]  Well, they come and kill you, but it's okay because they're liberal.
[15:29.000 --> 15:35.000]  And I'm going to explain that when we come back. We actually have them announcing they're going to dissolve all the major police forces
[15:35.000 --> 15:39.000]  and they've already got trained with guns, liberal police.
[15:39.000 --> 15:45.000]  They're going to be deputized by, oh, that's right, Pfizer and Homeland Security through the health department.
[15:45.000 --> 15:49.000]  I've got the legislation all right here. And they're all been training.
[15:49.000 --> 15:55.000]  They've all been training to come and murder you and your family one way or another with deadly injections or lead.
[15:55.000 --> 15:59.000]  Prepare yourselves.
[15:59.000 --> 16:07.000]  Christmas 2021 is over, but you still got a really great chance to give yourself the gift of free speech and liberty

[20:38.000 --> 20:43.000]  We're just one emplacement on the battlefield in this fight for human liberty and dignity.
[20:43.000 --> 20:46.000]  Everything you see happening to us is because they're coming after you.
[20:46.000 --> 20:48.000]  That's the truest thing Trump would ever say.
[20:48.000 --> 20:52.000]  Hey, they're trying to get through me to get to you. They're coming after me because I'm standing in their way.
[20:52.000 --> 20:57.000]  Well, we're definitely standing in the globalist way and you're standing with us with your word of mouth, your prayers,
[20:57.000 --> 21:00.000]  and when you buy the products at infowarstore.com.
[21:00.000 --> 21:06.000]  Only that has allowed us to build this base of resistance that the globalists hate so much even existing.
[21:06.000 --> 21:13.000]  Because if you don't have a base of operations, you can't launch a peaceful resistance against tyranny.
[21:13.000 --> 21:15.000]  And they don't want us to have any institutions.
[21:15.000 --> 21:20.000]  That's why they're now all over the Washington Post, all over the New York Times saying,
[21:20.000 --> 21:26.000]  oh, in ways the Trump base, which it's not the Trump base, something against Trump in the main.
[21:26.000 --> 21:31.000]  It's just that he wrote in on the populist Americana movement, it's we the people.
[21:31.000 --> 21:38.000]  But by labeling American flags and Bill of Rights and Constitution and national sovereignty and good economic policy,
[21:38.000 --> 21:42.000]  as Trump, they can pigeonhole it and then it rises and falls with Trump.
[21:42.000 --> 21:46.000]  That's not the case, but the headlines are all Trump.
[21:46.000 --> 21:49.000]  We need to block Trump ISPs.
[21:49.000 --> 21:51.000]  We need to block the Internet service providers.
[21:51.000 --> 21:53.000]  We need to block the URLs.
[21:53.000 --> 21:55.000]  We need to shut them down.
[21:55.000 --> 21:58.000]  We need to take them down.
[21:58.000 --> 22:06.000]  And if you remember before the last election in 2020, I told you, I said,
[22:06.000 --> 22:10.000]  when they steal the election from Trump, the mail-in ballots, they're calling it the red mirage.
[22:10.000 --> 22:14.000]  And the days after, they will then take him completely off the Internet.
[22:14.000 --> 22:24.000]  And they were already blocking him and deleting his tweets and shadow banning him the day after the election.
[22:24.000 --> 22:35.000]  And so with 303 days out from the election where every even establishment poll has Republicans winning by 15, 20 points.
[22:35.000 --> 22:37.000]  A huge political realignment.
[22:37.000 --> 22:47.000]  Major polls in the Midwest, the East Coast, the West Coast, show Hispanic Americans at above 50% planning to vote Republican.
[22:47.000 --> 22:52.000]  Not because I think Republicans are perfect, they're far from it, but they understand we've got a globalist enemy force
[22:52.000 --> 22:54.000]  literally destroying the country.
[22:54.000 --> 22:58.000]  And they're not going to have any future if they don't finally wake up out of the Democrat mind control.
[22:58.000 --> 23:02.000]  And that's a benchmark of how the Democrats know they've been rejected.
[23:02.000 --> 23:05.000]  They're known enemies that work with foreign powers.
[23:05.000 --> 23:09.000]  We know they're trying to wreck the country to consolidate and totally take control.
[23:09.000 --> 23:17.000]  So that once America is bankrupted, they can literally dominate us and control us and make us submit to becoming an authoritarian regime
[23:17.000 --> 23:21.000]  that they're going to control and then invade the rest of the planet with.
[23:21.000 --> 23:29.000]  Germany today, tomorrow the world, as Adolf Hitler said, America today, tomorrow the world, say the globalist.
[23:29.000 --> 23:35.000]  So, ladies and gentlemen, so much is happening.
[23:35.000 --> 23:42.000]  So much is unfolding and you're living in the middle of history right now.
[23:42.000 --> 23:48.000]  They have a worldwide economic collapse coming by design to consolidate control.
[23:48.000 --> 23:51.000]  The globalists ride it up on the front end with all the fiat currency.
[23:51.000 --> 23:54.000]  They give themselves all the debt and devaluation they give us.
[23:54.000 --> 23:57.000]  And then on the other side, they have all the assets.
[23:57.000 --> 23:58.000]  We have nothing.
[23:58.000 --> 24:00.000]  And then they really consolidate power and control.
[24:00.000 --> 24:03.000]  Not just so they're worth hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars.
[24:03.000 --> 24:10.000]  Soon to be trillionaires because it's devalued, multi-trillionaires, then quadrillionaires.
[24:10.000 --> 24:19.000]  No, but the actual real assets, so they then own the infrastructure and can dictate forced depopulation on everyone.
[24:19.000 --> 24:21.000]  Where you will accept becoming poor.
[24:21.000 --> 24:27.000]  You will accept taking deadly injections just to get a little bit of credits on your new World ID card.
[24:27.000 --> 24:33.000]  That is the holy grail of the Debo script.
[24:33.000 --> 24:35.000]  It's the holy grail of the new world order.
[24:35.000 --> 24:37.000]  It's what all the big Wall Street companies are saying.
[24:37.000 --> 24:40.000]  Oh, we're liberals now because of what's happening.
[24:40.000 --> 24:43.000]  We want to give you all a card that just gives you money.
[24:43.000 --> 24:49.000]  But you've got to do what we want and behave yourself or the money stops.
[24:49.000 --> 24:56.000]  Oh, if you could only spend that money at certain approved stores and companies, not with mom and pops.
[24:56.000 --> 25:01.000]  It's the end of cash, the end of medical freedom, the end of the country, the end of everything.
[25:01.000 --> 25:03.000]  It's not around the bend, folks.
[25:03.000 --> 25:04.000]  It's here.
[25:04.000 --> 25:10.000]  Now, I've just scratched the surface.
[25:10.000 --> 25:12.000]  I've got to hit the mass of COVID news.
[25:12.000 --> 25:14.000]  I've got to hit the Civil War news.
[25:14.000 --> 25:18.000]  I've got to hit this incredible damage control Reuters AP proclaim.
[25:18.000 --> 25:21.000]  No evidence of mass formation psychosis.
[25:21.000 --> 25:23.000]  This is an incredible stack.
[25:23.000 --> 25:30.000]  I'm going to hit at the start of the next hour and really spend some time on because this is next level of the mind control they've been caught in and how it's blown up in their face.
[25:30.000 --> 25:32.000]  And it gives us a lot of hope.
[25:32.000 --> 25:34.000]  And that's the next thing I was going to say.
[25:34.000 --> 25:39.000]  I'm only telling you how horrible all of this is and how bad all of this is.
[25:39.000 --> 25:43.000]  So you get out of your comfort zone and reach out to others and warn them.
[25:43.000 --> 25:47.000]  And so they warn others and so people know what's coming because this is all coming.
[25:47.000 --> 25:49.000]  Everything I told you is already here.
[25:49.000 --> 25:50.000]  Now I'm telling you what's coming.
[25:50.000 --> 25:53.000]  Most of you don't need me to tell you what's coming.
[25:53.000 --> 26:01.000]  But I'm telling you, we've got to get people to understand the villains of the UN, the villains of the big corporations, the villains of the Democratic Party.
[26:01.000 --> 26:04.000]  They've intimidated the Republicans into silence, most of them.
[26:04.000 --> 26:17.000]  And they are literally scientific dictators that see you as dumb animals and believe they're doing a good job in poverishing you and poisoning you and robbing you and enslaving you and ultimately killing you.
[26:17.000 --> 26:21.000]  You are a toxic product to be removed.
[26:21.000 --> 26:24.000]  You are worse than just not having any value.
[26:24.000 --> 26:27.000]  You are seen as a negative.
[26:27.000 --> 26:33.000]  You are seen as garbage to be disposed of and you have been warned.
[26:33.000 --> 26:40.000]  Now I'm going to hit all this coming up next segment, but I wanted to just speak to this because I'm going to read to you from the bills.
[26:40.000 --> 26:51.000]  They've got all over the country that major Democratic governors are supporting and are set to pass in places like New York where it describes how you will be kept in COVID camps for your behavior.
[26:51.000 --> 27:01.000]  They're already going away from the pretense, as I told you they would do, that once the camps open, once they start, we already saw what happened in Europe and Australia and New Zealand and now Canada.
[27:01.000 --> 27:05.000]  Then they go, you know what, we're just going to keep the troublemakers in there too.
[27:05.000 --> 27:09.000]  You protest this or you don't take the shot.
[27:09.000 --> 27:10.000]  That's in the bills.
[27:10.000 --> 27:11.000]  Oh, you didn't take the shot.
[27:11.000 --> 27:13.000]  You go to one, too.
[27:13.000 --> 27:24.000]  That's in the CDC document, shielding in place, it says we're going to go take children out of homes to put them in shield centers because they'll be safer at the shield center.
[27:24.000 --> 27:31.000]  We're going to take your children from healthy parents and put them in a shield center and they're doing that now in areas of Europe.
[27:31.000 --> 27:42.000]  This is training you to have your children taken away from you the last line to ever cross when they know they've broken your will and broken your back.
[27:42.000 --> 27:49.000]  And again, they're introducing people to the camps they're building and the facilities all over the world to the cover story of why they're doing this.
[27:49.000 --> 27:56.000]  That way, when there's no food starving in the streets, no power, when they turn the power off, that's their plan, claiming it's a cyber attack.
[27:56.000 --> 27:57.000]  I'll be claim I launched it.
[27:57.000 --> 27:59.000]  I'm not joking.
[27:59.000 --> 28:11.000]  American populace launched cyber attack, a Christian group of troglodytes who, you know, believe in not having technology following the Unabomber Code and Alex Jones knocked out the US power supply.
[28:11.000 --> 28:21.000]  But Klaus Schwab is beaming in and we've got television projection systems back up in some areas of the cities where you can go and it's the only media.
[28:21.000 --> 28:22.000]  Nothing else works.
[28:22.000 --> 28:29.000]  But on the screen is the UN and Klaus Schwab is telling us he has bugs for you to eat and that will happen.
[28:29.000 --> 28:31.000]  He'll be up there saying, I have bugs for you.
[28:31.000 --> 28:34.000]  And you go, that sounds insane.
[28:34.000 --> 28:45.000]  I've cracked their code, folks, they understand epigenetics and they understand that you wouldn't you don't have any instincts to face a dictator that tells you I'm going to enslave you.
[28:45.000 --> 28:46.000]  I'm going to hurt you.
[28:46.000 --> 28:48.000]  I'm going to starve you to death.
[28:48.000 --> 28:53.000]  So when someone tells you that you flip to it, it kind of going to Stockholm syndrome because it's one thing.
[28:53.000 --> 28:56.000]  The guy said, oh, I'm taking your freedom and your kids to a camp for fun.
[28:56.000 --> 29:00.000]  Well, they tell you they're doing it because you're a cockroach that needs to die.
[29:00.000 --> 29:02.000]  Christmas 2021 is gone.

[31:19.000 --> 31:21.000]  Superbill Vitality really, really works.
[31:21.000 --> 31:26.000]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[31:26.000 --> 31:30.000]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions.
[31:30.000 --> 31:33.000]  It also worked quite well, but just aren't as strong.
[31:33.000 --> 31:35.000]  This is like a very fine wine.
[31:35.000 --> 31:37.000]  In fact, each batch is different.
[31:37.000 --> 31:39.000]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[31:39.000 --> 31:42.000]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[31:42.000 --> 31:43.000]  That's just how it is.
[31:43.000 --> 31:44.000]  It's how it works.
[31:44.000 --> 31:46.000]  So it's always good.
[31:46.000 --> 31:49.000]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[31:49.000 --> 31:53.000]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[31:59.000 --> 32:04.000]  I am recording this announcement on the afternoon of January 6th, 2022.
[32:04.000 --> 32:14.000]  And that means there are only seven days left of us being able to offer our best selling product vitamin mineral fusion at 50% off.
[32:14.000 --> 32:17.000]  It has all the vitamins, all the minerals, incredible amino acids.

[32:23.000 --> 32:32.000]  That's why despite the fact that it's selling out at current sales rates, we're going to keep it on sale for another seven days.
[32:32.000 --> 32:38.000]  So we're running this until next Thursday and your purchase supports the broadcast.
[32:38.000 --> 32:46.000]  I want to thank you all for shopping with InfoWars. Without you, we would not have been on air and the world would be a much worse position right now that it's in.
[32:46.000 --> 32:54.000]  Thanks to you supporting InfoWars, we have now become the number one beacon of truth exposing the great reset and the new world order.
[32:54.000 --> 33:09.000]  So support your immune system and support free speech in the fight for liberty at the same time at InfoWars.com.
[33:24.000 --> 33:29.000]  When all you're going to get is approved Hollywood garbage and no other talk show host.
[33:29.000 --> 33:36.000]  Nobody else will be allowed to have any say on air except the globalist and their one world government propagandist.
[33:36.000 --> 33:40.000]  And everybody else is going to be starving to death and in slave labor camps.
[33:40.000 --> 33:42.000]  And that's the official plan.
[33:42.000 --> 33:47.000]  And if you talk to the average Democrat, they're in on it and they love it and they can't wait.
[33:47.000 --> 33:59.000]  And that's why I start talking fast and getting upset here is because I did a lot of research, a lot of preparation for this show.
[33:59.000 --> 34:08.000]  And I get in here and I start talking about it and I get so upset that soon it won't matter anymore.
[34:08.000 --> 34:15.000]  I mean, they have a plan to ban everything, shut off farming, shut off industry.
[34:15.000 --> 34:20.000]  It's already happening, shut off your power, shut off your oil, shut off your natural gas.
[34:20.000 --> 34:23.000]  And they're just accelerating it in front of everybody.
[34:23.000 --> 34:31.000]  And the left's been taught, oh, it's coming in 10, 15 years, so they get their minds wrapped around it and put the infrastructure in place to shut us down.
[34:31.000 --> 34:34.000]  But it's really coming in six months if we don't stop them.
[34:34.000 --> 34:37.000]  Because here's the key to everything.
[34:37.000 --> 34:45.000]  If you know the globalists have a deindustrialization plan to take full control of humanity and depopulate us and read their own admissions,
[34:45.000 --> 34:49.000]  then everything they do makes perfect sense and you know what's coming next.
[34:49.000 --> 34:58.000]  But people don't want to admit that, no, the globalists actually want to starve you to death and kill you and rape the women and children that they want to keep.
[34:58.000 --> 35:04.000]  And that that really happens more often in history than having an open free society like we've had.
[35:04.000 --> 35:16.000]  And our good open free society is under attack and authoritarian regimes everywhere are being promoted as good and as a good thing.
[35:16.000 --> 35:21.000]  So let me go over some of this for you here, ladies and gentlemen.
[35:21.000 --> 35:33.000]  Let me break some of this down here today because any one of these broadcasts could be our last, okay?
[35:33.000 --> 35:37.000]  I mean, this country, the world has a cancer called globalism.
[35:37.000 --> 35:41.000]  We have a very, very, very serious problem.
[35:41.000 --> 35:47.000]  And if we don't come to grips with it and if we don't admit it to ourselves, we have no hope of fixing, okay?
[35:47.000 --> 35:49.000]  And I just keep going back to that over and over again.
[35:49.000 --> 35:59.000]  So I want to play the Obama clip one more time of him going back more than 12 years ago when he was running for president,
[35:59.000 --> 36:06.000]  saying he wants a domestic security force just as big and just as strong as our military.
[36:06.000 --> 36:07.000]  Here it is.
[36:07.000 --> 36:15.000]  We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've set.
[36:15.000 --> 36:28.000]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[36:28.000 --> 36:33.000]  That is a presidential campaign speech in 2008.
[36:33.000 --> 36:38.000]  And now here we are, another blue state announces plans for strike force.
[36:38.000 --> 36:41.000]  That's a quote to involuntarily detain unvaccinated.
[36:41.000 --> 36:46.000]  It says if you are not vaccinated, you will be taken to a camp.
[36:46.000 --> 36:50.000]  They've now announced that in Australia and other areas as well.
[36:50.000 --> 36:53.000]  This is a global UN plan.
[36:53.000 --> 36:55.000]  That's how we knew they'd implement it.
[36:55.000 --> 37:04.000]  Bill Fould in Washington would authorize strike force to involuntarily detain unvaccinated families.
[37:04.000 --> 37:06.000]  They have already set up the internment camps.
[37:06.000 --> 37:08.000]  That's a quote.
[37:08.000 --> 37:11.000]  And now let me actually read to you out of it.
[37:11.000 --> 37:18.000]  The Washington State Board of Health may soon amend state law they're trying to to authorize the involuntary detainment of residents.
[37:18.000 --> 37:29.000]  These are quotes as young as five years old in COVID-19 quote internment camps that they called them internment camps for failing to comply with the state's experimental vaccine mandate.
[37:29.000 --> 37:34.000]  And then there's the bill number WAC 246 10-040.
[37:34.000 --> 37:37.000]  And then here's the actual bill again right there.
[37:37.000 --> 37:42.000]  But what's important about this is.
[37:42.000 --> 37:53.000]  It goes on to say the amended law would allow health officers to deploy law enforcement officials to assist with the arrest of uncompliant Washington residents.
[37:53.000 --> 38:06.000]  A local health officer may invoke the powers of the police officers, sheriffs constables and all other officers and employees of a political subdivision within the jurisdiction of the health department to enforce
[38:06.000 --> 38:12.000]  immediately orders given to the effectuated purposes of this section.
[38:12.000 --> 38:24.000]  And it goes on in the bill to say you will have the power of police, the police power via the health department, not just with the police, but any government personnel.
[38:24.000 --> 38:26.000]  I just read that it says it again in the bill.
[38:26.000 --> 38:30.000]  It's in there multiple times.
[38:30.000 --> 38:41.000]  And it goes on to say that it's not just for 10 days, then a judge may extend it to 30 days, including entire families.
[38:41.000 --> 38:52.000]  And then we've got it out of New York City, New York State, a bunch of other places that you've got all these headlines here about, oh, the National Guard is at the vaccine centers.
[38:52.000 --> 38:54.000]  And why do you think the National Guard's given the shots?
[38:54.000 --> 39:00.000]  Well, let's get used to seeing military out there. They're under martial law, but they're just upping the ante now, turning the heat up.
[39:00.000 --> 39:10.000]  And also, regular companies, regular stores, regular systems, they don't want the liability of giving these mRNA emergency shots.
[39:10.000 --> 39:19.000]  That's why they won't give them to the illegal aliens coming across the border, the migrants, is because no government's vouching to pay for the damages.
[39:19.000 --> 39:26.000]  Oh, the UN doesn't want the liability of giving people the death shots. They have us do that.
[39:26.000 --> 39:40.000]  And it's for the uppity westerners with their money and their cars and their houses and their lifestyle that they're not going to give up, so they've just got to die.
[39:40.000 --> 39:52.000]  So you see, collapse the police, collapse the military with purges, then use who's left to go out and roll out on the streets and prepare the public.
[39:52.000 --> 39:58.000]  Now, we do have some good news, and there's quite a bit of it. We're going to cover some of that when we come back in the next segment.
[39:58.000 --> 40:06.000]  And we're going to play a piece that Harrison Smith put out on Friday that Joe Rogan posted and pushed on his Twitter and other places.
[40:06.000 --> 40:20.000]  That's now got millions of views online. And it's not really a parody because it uses real quotes and real arguments of the gaslighting New World Order that are engaged in mass formation psychosis.
[40:20.000 --> 40:29.000]  Or the older term is simply mass psychosis or mob dynamics or mass hysteria.
[40:29.000 --> 40:41.000]  I mean, these are all psychological terms. Oh, but Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and Google, they're all carrying the fat checks of AP and Reuters that are in Beb and Pfizer saying it doesn't exist.
[40:41.000 --> 40:51.000]  That's right. And Bilderberg group doesn't exist. And nobody wants to make you take a shot. Remember a year ago, oh, that's a lie. No one will ever want forced inoculations.
[40:51.000 --> 41:01.000]  Oh, they work really good too. Of course, they don't lie after lie. So it's gotten very hard for me to stay on air at this point.
[41:01.000 --> 41:09.000]  Because it's hard to just sit up here and be calm about all this and sit here and go through your daily business.
[41:09.000 --> 41:17.000]  And to even see people that are awake and know what's going on still don't get how much danger everybody's in.
[41:17.000 --> 41:24.000]  Children don't get it. My family doesn't get it. I mean, they know this stuff's all real, but they have such a normalcy bias of everything always being okay.
[41:24.000 --> 41:32.000]  They don't get it's all coming to an end. The death camps are built. The real bio weapons are ready. They're ready to turn your power off.
[41:32.000 --> 41:38.000]  That's part of the plan to turn your power off for up to six months until you beg on your knees to do whatever they want.
[41:38.000 --> 41:44.000]  And that is an implantable microchip. That's why they're defunding the police. That's why they're collapsing the borders.
[41:44.000 --> 41:49.000]  This is war. We're under the attack right now.
[41:49.000 --> 41:53.000]  I'm going to come back with the Harrison Smith piece and play that and then I'll get into all the other good news.
[41:53.000 --> 41:58.000]  But people better wake up to what they're facing. Oh, there's no hope.
[41:58.000 --> 42:07.000]  And separately, the left constantly do everything they can to sabotage us and to sue us and to lie about us and try to silence us because they want to silence America.
[42:07.000 --> 42:15.000]  And that's why it's so important for you to get great products that support the broadcast but also support your immune system and your daily health at infowarstore.com.
[42:15.000 --> 42:19.000]  We have vitamin mineral fusion that's going to sell out in just a couple of days at current sales rates.
[42:19.000 --> 42:25.000]  It's 50% off with all the vitamins, all the minerals, all the amino acids. It's 50% off.
[42:25.000 --> 42:36.000]  And so is X2 sold out for many months, the highest quality iodine out there over the top for your immune system, the real missing link and your libido and your energy and your stamina and everything else.
[42:36.000 --> 42:40.000]  It is 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[42:40.000 --> 42:54.000]  And you never know, folks, if this could legitimately here in the next few months be the last time you can ever get an info wars t-shirt or even ever hear us on air because America is already in martial law and the flame is rising and it's the frog is dying.
[42:54.000 --> 43:00.000]  I mean, this is it. This is the end, folks. They're going to come kill you and your family.
[43:00.000 --> 43:07.000]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the build up for what the globalists are doing right now.
[43:07.000 --> 43:14.000]  This is their big offensive. This is their takeover. And this is the point that they're at their very weakest because now they've revealed themselves.
[43:14.000 --> 43:19.000]  Now their world government, their permanent martial law, their medical tyranny is out in the open.
[43:19.000 --> 43:28.000]  Their depopulation agenda has been exposed but they're using their corporate power and trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth.
[43:28.000 --> 43:33.000]  So listen, Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast, when you pray for the broadcast, you're the tip of the spear.
[43:33.000 --> 43:37.000]  And when you buy products at infowarstore.com, you keep us on air.

[43:47.000 --> 43:51.000]  And if there's two things you do for your body, it's these two products.

[43:55.000 --> 43:58.000]  Only way we fail is if you don't take action.

[44:36.000 --> 44:41.000]  So again, I am cutting this announcement on the afternoon of January 6, 2022.
[44:41.000 --> 44:46.000]  We're going to run this for a week and then we are going to be selling out of this product.
[44:46.000 --> 44:52.000]  Hopefully more comes in in the next month or so because it's the best seller and it's something everybody needs for their immune system and their body.
[44:52.000 --> 44:59.000]  Get your Vitamin Mineral Fusion now and support the InfoWare 360 win at infowarstore.com.
[45:23.000 --> 45:33.000]  That's why despite the fact that it's selling out at current sales rates, we're going to keep it on sale for another seven days.
[45:33.000 --> 45:38.000]  So we're running this until next Thursday and your purchase supports the broadcast.
[45:38.000 --> 45:41.000]  I want to thank you all for shopping with InfoWars.
[45:41.000 --> 45:46.000]  Without you, it would not have been on air and the world would be a much worse position right now than it's in.
[45:46.000 --> 45:54.000]  Thanks to you supporting InfoWars, we have now become the number one beacon of truth exposing the great reset and the new world order.
[45:54.000 --> 46:20.000]  So support your immune system and support free speech in the fight for liberty at the same time at infowarstore.com.
[46:25.000 --> 46:32.000]  Is it time to just move out to the woods, just time to go get a piece of property in the woods and just get off grid, just get the emergency food supplies, just live off the land?
[46:32.000 --> 46:33.000]  That's the survival instinct.
[46:33.000 --> 46:39.000]  But see the worldly part of me that's still probably the majority part of me says no, no, no, no, no, stay in the city.
[46:39.000 --> 46:44.000]  The survival instinct says get the hell out of anywhere there's ever notion that you need to get a vaccine or a mask.
[46:44.000 --> 46:50.000]  That's the internal struggle that my guess is a lot of you in the audience are facing as well.
[46:50.000 --> 46:55.000]  But you can at least have some comfort if you have the emergency food supplies.
[46:55.000 --> 46:57.000]  And so we have the best ones at infowarstore.com.
[47:01.000 --> 47:07.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:07.000 --> 47:11.000]  Listen, I know you've never heard anybody talk like this on Talk Radio.
[47:11.000 --> 47:14.000]  This is the Alex Jones show.
[47:14.000 --> 47:18.000]  This is where you hear about the Great Reset.
[47:18.000 --> 47:25.000]  This is where you hear about the New World Order's plans for the takeover.
[47:25.000 --> 47:38.000]  This is where you hear about the New World Order's plans for the takeover, ladies and gentlemen.
[47:38.000 --> 47:41.000]  And that's where we are right now.
[47:41.000 --> 47:47.000]  A foreign multinational group of hardcore criminals have taken control of western governments.
[47:47.000 --> 47:49.000]  They own the corporations, the big banks, the media.
[47:49.000 --> 47:51.000]  They want to depopulate the planet.
[47:51.000 --> 47:56.000]  They want to have an organized collapse of civilization that they blame on the old capitalist model.
[47:56.000 --> 48:02.000]  And then on the ashes of that, build a technocracy that only allows 10% of the original population to live.
[48:02.000 --> 48:09.000]  That group will be forced to transcend, as they call it, into machines.
[48:09.000 --> 48:12.000]  This is the official plan.
[48:12.000 --> 48:21.000]  That's what they all say, from Ray Kurzweil to Bill Gates, to Klaus Schwab, to every damn one of them.
[48:21.000 --> 48:25.000]  It is the plan of the Carnegie and Rockefeller Foundation.
[48:25.000 --> 48:28.000]  The Carnegie Foundation runs the CIA.
[48:28.000 --> 48:34.000]  The CIA is running all of this, because it's not even the CIA.
[48:34.000 --> 48:41.000]  It's all the bureaucracies are run by the death cult, by the transhumanist, the top generals, the top military people,
[48:41.000 --> 48:42.000]  the top corporate leaders.
[48:42.000 --> 48:49.000]  They've been recruited into the group, and they've stolen the world through fraud.
[48:49.000 --> 48:53.000]  They're fabulously rich and powerful, and they don't want to supply you with goods and services.
[48:53.000 --> 48:57.000]  They don't want you and your human system anymore.
[48:57.000 --> 48:59.000]  They want robots and machines to serve them.
[48:59.000 --> 49:07.000]  You are obsolete, and their argument is you're so dumb and selfish and stupid that even though it's known they're doing this to you,
[49:07.000 --> 49:12.000]  you won't stand up for yourself, and that's why Klaus Schwab and all of them brag about it.
[49:12.000 --> 49:19.000]  And I've had conversations with people at Klaus Schwab's level, trying to get me hired by them years ago,
[49:19.000 --> 49:20.000]  where they told me the same thing.
[49:20.000 --> 49:26.000]  And they said, when this all starts happening, Alex, people are going to adapt to being enslaved,
[49:26.000 --> 49:28.000]  not adapt and overcome like you're doing.
[49:28.000 --> 49:30.000]  You need to join us.
[49:30.000 --> 49:35.000]  Survival of fitness, we provide a service to the earth and to the species to do this.
[49:35.000 --> 49:41.000]  You just don't have the strength or the will to do what must be done.
[49:41.000 --> 49:42.000]  Well, I know this man.
[49:42.000 --> 49:46.000]  I'm not going to help kill everybody, but I'm pissed at the general public.
[49:46.000 --> 49:47.000]  I'll tell you that.
[49:47.000 --> 49:51.000]  I'm glad Joe Rogan's finally getting that it's an on-purpose takeover depopulation.
[49:51.000 --> 49:52.000]  He finally gets it.
[49:52.000 --> 49:53.000]  He's blown away.
[49:53.000 --> 49:55.000]  His learning curve better be real fast.
[49:55.000 --> 49:56.000]  Same thing with Tucker Carlson.
[49:56.000 --> 49:59.000]  Great guy finally gets it.
[49:59.000 --> 50:02.000]  Everybody's got to get it real quick, okay?
[50:02.000 --> 50:07.000]  All these top medical doctors we have in here, behind the scenes, they go, oh yeah, it's total takeover.
[50:07.000 --> 50:08.000]  Probably aliens running it.
[50:08.000 --> 50:09.000]  We never seen anything like it.
[50:09.000 --> 50:10.000]  It's so advanced.
[50:10.000 --> 50:12.000]  They're getting rid of humanity.
[50:12.000 --> 50:14.000]  All we know is it's a planet depopulate.
[50:14.000 --> 50:15.000]  It's so anti-human.
[50:15.000 --> 50:16.000]  It's so satanic.
[50:16.000 --> 50:19.000]  Great reset, new world order, blah, blah, blah.
[50:19.000 --> 50:21.000]  Because they've all been around these people.
[50:21.000 --> 50:22.000]  They've all been at those levels.
[50:22.000 --> 50:26.000]  That's what this is, is a scientific cult.
[50:26.000 --> 50:29.000]  And they're not aliens coming to visit us and flying saucers.
[50:29.000 --> 50:33.000]  It's Klaus Schwab and these people say, we're going to live forever.
[50:33.000 --> 50:36.000]  We're going to save the earth by depopulating you.
[50:36.000 --> 50:39.000]  And then we're going to merge with machines and live forever.
[50:39.000 --> 50:41.000]  But you can't have a bunch of people living forever.
[50:41.000 --> 50:47.000]  So we're going to get rid of almost everybody because you don't deserve to transcend.
[50:47.000 --> 50:54.000]  And I'm just sitting here watching this, trying to explain to people whether it's this year or next year or five years from now.
[50:54.000 --> 50:59.000]  Their timetable is moving faster and faster towards total collapse.
[50:59.000 --> 51:07.000]  And again, they're going to trigger a huge race war during the collapse to blame the collapse on the race war and not on them engineering it.
[51:07.000 --> 51:08.000]  They are so arrogant.
[51:08.000 --> 51:10.000]  They are so out of control.
[51:10.000 --> 51:13.000]  They are so damn slimy.
[51:13.000 --> 51:17.000]  They are soulless evil people, ladies and gentlemen.
[51:17.000 --> 51:19.000]  And they're so proud of what they've done.
[51:19.000 --> 51:23.000]  They are a eugenics, technocracy, death cult.
[51:23.000 --> 51:30.000]  Now, the good news is Joe Rogan tweeted this out your stay when I sent it to him.
[51:30.000 --> 51:33.000]  And it's gotten millions of views here and there and it's great.
[51:33.000 --> 51:34.000]  It needs 50 million views.
[51:34.000 --> 51:41.000]  And it's Harrison Smith's video that's on infowars.com and band.video.
[51:41.000 --> 51:48.000]  And it's titled Watch COVID Pitch Meeting.
[51:48.000 --> 51:57.000]  And you need to get it out to everybody, you know, because it shows their real lives, their disinformation in real time.
[51:57.000 --> 52:04.000]  Here it is.
[52:04.000 --> 52:05.000]  Good news.
[52:05.000 --> 52:06.000]  Oh, yeah.
[52:06.000 --> 52:09.000]  Yeah, we've rolled back the ban on gain of function research, really.
[52:09.000 --> 52:14.000]  So now it's legal for us to modify viruses and make them more deadly and transmissible to humans.
[52:14.000 --> 52:16.000]  Why would you want to do that?
[52:16.000 --> 52:19.000]  It's important that we be prepared in case something like that happened in the future.
[52:19.000 --> 52:24.000]  In case somebody modifies a deadly virus to be more infectious and able to transmit to humans.
[52:24.000 --> 52:26.000]  Can you imagine?
[52:26.000 --> 52:27.000]  Yeah, sounds dangerous.
[52:27.000 --> 52:28.000]  No, no, no.
[52:28.000 --> 52:29.000]  It's fine.
[52:29.000 --> 52:32.000]  We're doing it at a level four weapons research lab in Wuhan, China.
[52:32.000 --> 52:33.000]  Very secure.
[52:33.000 --> 52:34.000]  Okay, good.
[52:34.000 --> 52:36.000]  Terrible news.
[52:36.000 --> 52:37.000]  Oh, no.
[52:37.000 --> 52:42.000]  There's been an outbreak of a mysterious new respiratory virus in Wuhan, China.
[52:42.000 --> 52:43.000]  Wuhan, China?
[52:43.000 --> 52:44.000]  Like where the research lab is?
[52:44.000 --> 52:46.000]  Yeah, yeah, exactly. Like right where the lab is.
[52:46.000 --> 52:48.000]  So do you think it could have come from the lab?
[52:48.000 --> 52:51.000]  No, absolutely not.
[52:51.000 --> 52:54.000]  I'd see how you could make that mistake, but no, no, no.
[52:54.000 --> 52:59.000]  The virus, the deadly virus with the artificial fear and cleavage sites that make it able to infect humans,
[52:59.000 --> 53:03.000]  that came from the farmer's market down the road from the dangerous bioweapons lab.
[53:03.000 --> 53:05.000]  And you expect us to believe that?
[53:05.000 --> 53:07.000]  I'll ban you from the internet if you don't.
[53:07.000 --> 53:08.000]  Oh, God.
[53:08.000 --> 53:09.000]  No need to worry.
[53:09.000 --> 53:12.000]  The global medical establishments always preparing for these types of things.
[53:12.000 --> 53:18.000]  In fact, like two months ago, they held a course called Event 201 where they basically predicted exactly what would happen
[53:18.000 --> 53:21.000]  right down to the type of virus and where it came from.
[53:21.000 --> 53:23.000]  So they're like totally on top of this.
[53:23.000 --> 53:26.000]  Actually, they're going to do nothing for months and let it spread all over the world.
[53:26.000 --> 53:27.000]  But it started in China, right?
[53:27.000 --> 53:29.000]  Like can't we at least halt travel with them?
[53:29.000 --> 53:31.000]  I didn't realize you were a racist.
[53:31.000 --> 53:32.000]  What?
[53:32.000 --> 53:36.000]  Yeah, I didn't realize you had some deep, seething, hatred of Asian people.
[53:36.000 --> 53:38.000]  And in fact, I think it's despicable.
[53:38.000 --> 53:39.000]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[53:39.000 --> 53:40.000]  I'm talking about the virus.
[53:40.000 --> 53:41.000]  Oh, the virus?
[53:41.000 --> 53:42.000]  It's here now.
[53:42.000 --> 53:43.000]  Yeah, I bet.
[53:43.000 --> 53:44.000]  Yeah, it came on a plane from China.
[53:44.000 --> 53:45.000]  There's nothing we could do.
[53:45.000 --> 53:47.000]  Well, what do we know about the virus so far?
[53:47.000 --> 53:51.000]  Not a lot, but we're going to go ahead and assume that it's the deadliest thing in the world
[53:51.000 --> 53:52.000]  and everybody's scared.
[53:52.000 --> 53:53.000]  We're all scared.
[53:53.000 --> 53:55.000]  You didn't seem very worried about it when it was in China.
[53:55.000 --> 53:56.000]  Well, no, no.
[53:56.000 --> 53:57.000]  I was calling you a racist then.
[53:57.000 --> 53:58.000]  That's what was important.
[53:58.000 --> 54:00.000]  But now we're very scared of the virus.
[54:00.000 --> 54:01.000]  Everybody's scared.
[54:01.000 --> 54:02.000]  You're scared.
[54:02.000 --> 54:05.000]  Well, does it affect certain ages or populations or groups, anything like that?
[54:05.000 --> 54:08.000]  Yeah, actually, it's way deadlier to the elderly and the sick.
[54:08.000 --> 54:10.000]  Okay, well, why don't we start by protecting them?
[54:10.000 --> 54:14.000]  No, we're actually going to send COVID infected patients into nursing homes instead.
[54:14.000 --> 54:15.000]  Geez, well, okay.
[54:15.000 --> 54:17.000]  Well, what are you doing to stop the spread?
[54:17.000 --> 54:19.000]  UV lights, vitamin C, vitamin D?
[54:19.000 --> 54:20.000]  Should I wear a mask?
[54:20.000 --> 54:23.000]  We know that masks don't really stop you from getting this type of infection.
[54:23.000 --> 54:26.000]  The science is pretty much settled on this.
[54:26.000 --> 54:27.000]  Masks don't work.
[54:27.000 --> 54:28.000]  Okay, so no masks.
[54:28.000 --> 54:31.000]  Actually, they're mandatory and also we're shutting down everything.
[54:31.000 --> 54:32.000]  Wait, what?
[54:32.000 --> 54:33.000]  Yeah, it's called lockdown.
[54:33.000 --> 54:36.000]  I'm basically declaring martial law and saying that you can't leave your house or gather
[54:36.000 --> 54:37.000]  in large groups.
[54:37.000 --> 54:40.000]  How do you think you're going to get people to go along with this?
[54:40.000 --> 54:43.000]  Well, it's only for two weeks.
[54:43.000 --> 54:45.000]  It's going to last forever, isn't it?
[54:45.000 --> 54:46.000]  Maybe.
[54:46.000 --> 54:47.000]  And you're shutting everything down?
[54:47.000 --> 54:48.000]  Everything?
[54:48.000 --> 54:49.000]  Every restaurant?
[54:49.000 --> 54:50.000]  Every store?
[54:50.000 --> 54:51.000]  Yep, absolutely everything.
[54:51.000 --> 54:52.000]  Everything's shut down.
[54:52.000 --> 54:53.000]  We're all in this together.
[54:53.000 --> 54:55.000]  So even like Walmart and Target, no, they can stay open.
[54:55.000 --> 54:57.000]  What about like McDonald's or Taco Bell?
[54:57.000 --> 55:00.000]  Obviously, McDonald's and Taco Bell can stay open.
[55:00.000 --> 55:04.000]  Okay, so the big chain stores can stay open, but if a small business tries to stay open,
[55:04.000 --> 55:08.000]  we will send a tank and point a rifle in their face and maybe send them to jail, but it's
[55:08.000 --> 55:10.000]  only for two weeks or years or whatever.
[55:10.000 --> 55:12.000]  I mean, won't that crash the economy?
[55:12.000 --> 55:13.000]  Oh yeah, 100% for sure.
[55:13.000 --> 55:15.000]  Okay, but this stops the virus.
[55:15.000 --> 55:16.000]  It does not, no.
[55:16.000 --> 55:20.000]  Okay, other than masks that don't work and lockdowns that don't work, is there anything
[55:20.000 --> 55:21.000]  else you suggest that we do?
[55:21.000 --> 55:23.000]  Oh, I'm not suggesting anything.
[55:23.000 --> 55:27.000]  I'm imposing plastic barriers and social distancing as well.
[55:27.000 --> 55:28.000]  Okay, so those work?
[55:28.000 --> 55:29.000]  No, of course not.
[55:29.000 --> 55:30.000]  It's ridiculous.
[55:30.000 --> 55:31.000]  Just think about it.
[55:31.000 --> 55:35.000]  We do encourage contact tracing where you download our app to your phone and then use it to
[55:35.000 --> 55:38.000]  log everywhere you go and everything you do and everyone you interact with.
[55:38.000 --> 55:40.000]  Sounds like a precursor to vaccine passports.
[55:40.000 --> 55:42.000]  No way, that's crazy.
[55:42.000 --> 55:46.000]  Hey, by the way, we sent an investigative team to figure out the origins of the virus.
[55:46.000 --> 55:47.000]  Oh, so you're investigating the lab?
[55:47.000 --> 55:48.000]  No.
[55:48.000 --> 55:50.000]  Okay, well, who are you sending to investigate?
[55:50.000 --> 55:51.000]  The guy who runs the lab.
[55:51.000 --> 55:53.000]  Yeah, this sounds suspicious.
[55:53.000 --> 55:54.000]  It's not.
[55:54.000 --> 55:56.000]  I mean, the whole thing sounds sketchy.
[55:56.000 --> 55:59.000]  Nothing you're saying really makes any sense and it seems like the same people imposing
[55:59.000 --> 56:03.000]  the masks and lockdowns are the same people that are benefiting from it and it seems like
[56:03.000 --> 56:06.000]  it's going to have way worse long-term effects than the virus itself.
[56:06.000 --> 56:08.000]  I mean, all of this seems arbitrary and expensive.
[56:08.000 --> 56:12.000]  Well, it's only until we get the vaccine and actually it's going to be a wonderful revolutionary
[56:12.000 --> 56:14.000]  new mRNA vaccine.
[56:14.000 --> 56:17.000]  So, you know, thank God we have Bill Gates helping us with this.
[56:17.000 --> 56:21.000]  Bill Gates, doesn't he the one who thinks the most pressing issue the Earth faces is
[56:21.000 --> 56:25.000]  overpopulation and that the best way to reduce population is through vaccines?
[56:25.000 --> 56:27.000]  Didn't he give a TED talk to that effect?
[56:27.000 --> 56:28.000]  No, shut up.
[56:28.000 --> 56:29.000]  I'll close you.
[56:29.000 --> 56:33.000]  All right, that's the host of the American Journal.
[56:33.000 --> 56:36.000]  Harrison Smith does an incredible job weekday mornings.
[56:36.000 --> 56:39.000]  8 a.m. to 11 a.m. right before I come home with the Alex Jones show.
[56:39.000 --> 56:44.000]  Then there's the War Room, Owen Schreuer, and that is 3 to 6 p.m. Central weekdays.
[56:44.000 --> 56:47.000]  And of course, here we are Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. with Alex Jones.
[56:47.000 --> 56:51.000]  And then Sunday Live, hosted by our round table, a different host tonight.
[56:51.000 --> 56:54.000]  It's Christy Lee coming up 6 to 8 p.m.
[56:54.000 --> 56:56.000]  And there's only six minutes of ads an hour.
[56:56.000 --> 56:59.000]  Six minutes for local stations, but no ad breaks for us.
[56:59.000 --> 57:02.000]  A lot of stations are excited about that and picking it up.
[57:02.000 --> 57:07.000]  So Christy Lee is going to be taking over here in about an hour and four minutes.
[57:07.000 --> 57:12.000]  Again, I'm so upset I can barely do these shows anymore because, I mean, I know this is real.
[57:12.000 --> 57:13.000]  I know this is going down.
[57:13.000 --> 57:17.000]  We have the numbers coming in from insurance companies, governments, you name it,
[57:17.000 --> 57:22.000]  millions dead from the shots, tens of millions sick, and it's only getting worse.
[57:22.000 --> 57:25.000]  They wouldn't have done this unless they were planning something even worse to cover up from this.
[57:25.000 --> 57:30.000]  So I got, I mean, I'm telling you folks, I'm a pretty tough guy and I'm freaked out all the time now.
[57:30.000 --> 57:33.000]  Okay. I mean, I'm 10 times more freaked out than I ever was.
[57:33.000 --> 57:36.000]  You need to be freaked out. You need to be upset.
[57:36.000 --> 57:40.000]  You need to be running around like a chicken with your head cut off, peacefully warning everybody.
[57:40.000 --> 57:42.000]  It's the only way to stop these murderers.
[57:42.000 --> 57:44.000]  If they know they're going to get caught, they'll pull back,
[57:44.000 --> 57:48.000]  but they're about to drop the next hammer hour two coming up.
[57:51.000 --> 57:53.000]  Get our great bag of it here.
[57:53.000 --> 57:58.000]  I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[57:58.000 --> 58:04.000]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic in the volcanic soil,
[58:04.000 --> 58:05.000]  better than Guatemalan coffee.
[58:05.000 --> 58:09.000]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists,
[58:09.000 --> 58:10.000]  but really they're just a commune.
[58:10.000 --> 58:13.000]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it.
[58:13.000 --> 58:15.000]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[58:15.000 --> 58:20.000]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years and the price has never gone up.
[58:20.000 --> 58:24.000]  The safe stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound.
[58:24.000 --> 58:27.000]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[58:27.000 --> 58:31.000]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas Rebels, literally.
[58:31.000 --> 58:33.000]  In fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story.
[58:36.000 --> 58:37.000]  Yeah, I'd like to.
[58:37.000 --> 58:38.000]  Okay, you wouldn't believe it.
[58:38.000 --> 58:43.000]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation.
[58:43.000 --> 58:50.000]  And if you don't find us and don't want to share, that's fine.
[59:14.000 --> 59:16.000]  Goji berry, alfalfa herb powder.
[59:16.000 --> 59:19.000]  Then it's got added magnesium and potassium for electrolytes.
[59:19.000 --> 59:26.000]  It's got real organic cocoa bean powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt.
[59:26.000 --> 59:28.000]  It even tastes better than last formula.
[59:28.000 --> 59:30.000]  And what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[59:30.000 --> 59:37.000]  Again, it has that cutting edge, chicken broth, protein, isolate powder for better flavor and solvability.
[59:37.000 --> 59:39.000]  You're going to love this.
[59:39.000 --> 59:41.000]  And what it does for your joints, what it does for your body,
[59:41.000 --> 59:45.000]  what it does for your bones is simply amazing and it helps fund the infowar.
[59:45.000 --> 59:49.000]  This is really the best bone broth out there, so get yours at infowarstore.com today.
[1:00:03.000 --> 1:00:07.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, if we admit we're under attack,
[1:00:07.000 --> 1:00:11.000]  we have a chance to beat just to be like if you were in a car wreck, cut your arm off.
[1:00:11.000 --> 1:00:16.000]  And you're five years old and your mom says, okay, my son's going to bleed to death
[1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:18.000]  or my daughter's going to bleed to death.
[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:20.000]  I got to admit their arms cut off, blood spurting out.
[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:21.000]  I've got to control myself.
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:22.000]  I've got to tie a tourniquet.
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:23.000]  I've got to rip some cloth.
[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  I've got to tie it around their arm and I've got to get them to the hospital.
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  And you can save them.
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:36.000]  But if you don't admit our arms cut off, folks, we as a society are going to die.
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  We're going to be over.
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:42.000]  Now, I'm going to have some incredible news next segment that I haven't hit yet.
[1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  All this COVID news now ties into their gaslighting.
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:47.000]  It's literally and just such war.
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  And now people are waking up and it's not working.
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  Now, Justice Thomas on the Supreme Court said this is really a dangerous vaccine.
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  That quote's coming up.
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:56.000]  But first, here's Dr. Malone.
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  So we remember who we're up against and then we'll play the Australian governor,
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  a major premier announcing next level martial law.
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  Here it is.
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  The other thing for me has been the personal journey of coming to terms with what the
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  World Economic Forum really represents.
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  And I really resisted that, you know, people initially were coming to me talking about the
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  great reset.
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  I was like, oh, there's a crazy talk.
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  That sounds like a conspiracy theory.
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  Yeah.
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  Yeah.
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  Great reset.
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  Yeah.
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  But then it's all documented.
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  And then you see it being deployed in a group of Canadians on a podcast the other day,
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  sent me some links from W.E.F. to a site.
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  This is one of the last things I tweeted before.
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  And it had a extremely detailed map of all of the policy positions and the actions that
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  the W.E.F. was taking for a huge range of topics, not least of which is COVID-19.
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  And it's kind of a public document that clearly states everybody that's in our little click
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  in our club, these are the things that we will think, these are the things that we will
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  say, this is how we will act.
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:27.000]  And that one was kind of like the icing on the cake.
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:30.000]  That was, oh, here it is.
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:32.000]  They're proud of it.
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  They don't hide it.
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  This is the vision.
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  It is a full on globalist, totalitarian vision with the money in control.
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  And the whole, I did a lot of political science when I was an undergraduate in the early 80s.
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  And I had read things like about books about transnationalism in the New World Order.
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  I found that fascinating, but confusing.
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:04.000]  How could this possibly happen?
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  And now to see it playing out in real time.
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  And in a way in which national sovereignty governments are increasingly irrelevant.
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  Yeah.
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  That's, you know, that's the thing that folks got to wake up about.
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  This is not about the vaccine.
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  No, it's about a transnational corporate tyranny using a virus they created as the pretext to bring in their total world
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  government collapse, all of our basic freedoms.
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  It is a totalitarian vision.
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  Here's one of the major governors in Australia.
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  I will now go through each of these decisions.
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  First, the lockout.
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  The fully vaccinated can continue as they were.
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  For people who are not vaccinated, lockdown rules will apply to everyone 16 and above.
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  If you are not fully vaxxed, stay home.
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:59.000]  You are at greater risk of catching COVID, becoming ill and needing hospital care.
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  You may only leave home for three reasons.
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  Medical treatment, including COVID testing of vaccination.
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  For essential goods and services like groceries, power tokens, medications.
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  To provide care and support to a family member or person who cannot support themselves.
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  You cannot travel more than 30 kilometres from your home when leaving for one of the three reasons,
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  or the nearest practical destination.
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  If you need to go to the hospital as more than 30 kilometres from your home, that's okay.
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  There are only three reasons to leave the home now, not five.
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  Work is not a reason to leave the home for the unvaccinated.
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:46.000]  The Chief Health Officer has also determined that restriction of movement is critical right now,
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  and that one hour of exercise for the next four days is not essential.
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:59.000]  Remember, these restrictions only apply to those who are not fully vaccinated.
[1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:05.000]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare
[1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:09.000]  and with poisons and chemicals added to the food. It's all come out.
[1:05:09.000 --> 1:05:14.000]  And they're doing that not because we're weak, but because we're made the image of God, the Creator,
[1:05:14.000 --> 1:05:16.000]  and we are powerful.
[1:05:16.000 --> 1:05:19.000]  And the social engineers fear that so much.
[1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:24.000]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with the boy.
[1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  Is it true?
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:32.000]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:37.000]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  because they know we are strong.
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:45.000]  And they know in the end they signed on the God of this world who is a loser.
[1:05:45.000 --> 1:05:49.000]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep info wars on the air now more than ever.
[1:05:49.000 --> 1:05:55.000]  Because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting and setting up is safe handling.
[1:05:55.000 --> 1:06:19.000]  And we are opposing the one world government and the market that we just announced.
[1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:26.000]  So will Clarence Thomas be banned by Twitter or Facebook?
[1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:29.000]  Or will they have a fact checker come out and say he's a liar?
[1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:34.000]  Because he got so to my or running around saying 100,000 children are in the hospital.
[1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:37.000]  Thousands are on ventilators. Thousands have died.
[1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:40.000]  There's thousands of children in the hospital.
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:47.000]  Most of them have some other condition, but they also test positive for COVID because they test them with PCR tests turned up so high that
[1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  obviously everybody is positive.
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:53.000]  But basically no children are dying from COVID.
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:56.000]  And so she says thousands are dying, 100,000 are in there.
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:06:58.000]  It's a total lie.
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:01.000]  But she's spouting the official narrative, so that's okay.
[1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:07.000]  But Clarence Thomas is saying, because the Supreme Court, as you know, heard Friday on whether they're going to get rid of medical freedom in this country
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:17.000]  and quote, make us take Nuremberg code violating experimental gene therapies that erase your immune system.
[1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:26.000]  And in major studies are confirmed to cause cancer, heart attacks, heart swelling and messing up your uterus, your testicles,
[1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  attacking your ovaries.
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:28.000]  It's all right here.
[1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:30.000]  I'll show it to you in a moment.
[1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:38.000]  But first here is Clarence Thomas pointing out the elephant in the room that this is a dangerous injection.
[1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  Don't you think it's a bit curious that you're placing significant reliance on a provision that speaks about necessary to the efficient
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:08:02.000]  administration to administer a vaccine that could have significant health consequences?
[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  Oh, so there you go.
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:12.000]  Of a society we must administer a vaccine that could have significant health consequences.
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:13.000]  See, he's smart.
[1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:16.000]  He knows this is coming out.
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:18.000]  He knows the real numbers.
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  His wife's awake and smart.
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  They've got the facts.
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  So he's there going, whoa, what are you doing?
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:30.000]  Well, it's going to destroy the social compact.
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  It's going to destroy the social contract.
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:39.000]  I mean, this is the end of civilization.
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  That's the UN environmental terrorist Klaus Schwab plan.
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:46.000]  That's what the rich billionaires want is us dead.
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:54.000]  I mean, people better get that extinction rebellion is allowed to just sabotage trains, block highways, kill people, burn things down,
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  and the police just red carpet them in the UK because they work for the establishment.
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  Extinction rebellion are the foot soldiers of this thing.
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  Antifa, all of them.
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:12.000]  This is a revolution of the elite against humanity and against the industrialized world.
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  Now, in contrast, here's so to my or saying four huge lies, but the big one was 100,000 dead and thousands on ventilators.
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  And then Omnicron is as bad as Delta.
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  Not even one 100th is bad.
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  It's like a mild cold.
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  I had Delta was not fun.
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  And I went off what real scientists were putting out the first COVID very hard to get if you got it was a big problem, very hard to spread.
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  Then Delta, very easy to get.
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  Very, very painful trick.
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  Most people to go to the hospitals.
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:50.000]  They would get intubated and die.
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  If you could just ignore the pain and get the steroids and pick ever make it.
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:56.000]  It would be gone very quickly, but it was painful.
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  So I had your lungs squeezing them.
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  But now Omnicron looks like it was made in a lab by good guys to counter this.
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  It's got a bunch of artificial insertions on the spike protein, blending at 20 plus of them.
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:14.000]  But regardless whether God did it or man did it, we know man made the first one.
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  That's now happened.
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  And so yes, you want Omnicron.
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  It's nature's vaccine for all this COVID crap.
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:24.000]  Because there's not just evil in the world folks.
[1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  There's white hats as well.
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  So whether it was God or God ordered one of his angels to do it or you know, scientists did it.
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  It looks artificial in the lab.
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:34.000]  And I've had scientists in studio that have talked about that.
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  But the Fox News host, I'm going to play the full five minute clip, defended her and said, well, you know,
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  the people that are in the hospital, they didn't take the shot.
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  And so it's not 100,000, but still everybody in the hospital didn't have the shot.
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  No, in all the studies, you're twice as likely to be in the hospital if you've had the shot.
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  And we've shown that at nauseam.
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  So they defend Sotomayor's lie because she's not stupid.
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:04.000]  They defend her lies, talking points, Bill Gates talking points with more lies.
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  Well, she meant well because everybody in the hospital didn't have the shot.
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  Here it is.
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  You know, you just heard about the U.S. Supreme Court currently deciding the fate of the president's vaccine mandates
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  in the questioning.
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  Justice Sonia Sotomayor made this statement.
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  We have over 100,000 children, which we've never had before in serious condition and many on ventilators.
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  Now, we can find from Friday suggests there are fewer than 3,500 current pediatric hospitalizations from COVID-19.
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  Is that true?
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  Yeah, but, you know, here's what I can tell you about our pediatric hospitalizations.
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  Now, first of all, the vast majority of children who are in the hospital are unvaccinated.
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  And for those children who are not eligible for vaccination, we do know that they are most likely to get sick with COVID
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  if their family members aren't vaccinated.
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  So the most important thing.
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  I can't hear the lies anymore.
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  Shut her down.
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  So there you go.
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  The huge whopper lie on the crowns is bad.
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  She had a bunch of other lies.
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  But just the answers, let's put some more lies on top of the first lies.
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  New lies for old is what that technique is called.
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  Let me show you some headlines before we go to break and come back with the huge damage control report.
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  Reuters AP proclaimed no evidence of mass formation psychosis.
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  I'm going to give you the deep dive on this from history and show you their criminals lying to you and your family here in a moment.
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  The same criminals that run the FDA and the government and the CDC that don't want you to have vitamin D or C or zinc or iodine
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  or any of the things or or or quercetin or ivermectin or any of it.
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  Let's continue.
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  Some good news.
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  Judge rejects FDA 75 year delay on Vax data cuts it to just eight months.
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  Wow.
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  Federal judge said no, we're not going to give you 75 years before you give us the data.
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  But whistleblowers already leaked it.
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  Massive deaths, thousands of dead, including hundreds of dead children after they take the shots.
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  Big, huge article from zero hedge up on info wars.
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:24.000]  Study COVID-19 vaccine causes temporary changes to menstrual cycle, including sterility now liberal.
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  A major study by obstetrics and gynecology journal of the Oregon Health and Science University found it.
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  You should go read the study.
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  They say it's temporary because I don't know how long it goes, but it could eat the lining of your uterus.
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  Everything the scientists warned it would do because the fast growing protein that's in the uterus, that's the same protein as the spike protein.
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  Same thing with your ovaries.
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  Same thing with your testicles.
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  Very loving, right?
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:14:00.000]  Bill Gates said we need vaccines to depopulate and it's working on average for international level soccer players are dying a week.
[1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  Previously, less than one died every five years. I've got the numbers right here.
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  Every five years, an international soccer player would die of a heart attack.
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:10.000]  These guys are in the best shape anybody out there probably.
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:12.000]  Well, now it's for a week.
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  Dozens having heart attacks a week just on the international soccer circuit.
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  And I've got some big breaking news on that front.
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  I was thinking today, telling a friend about it, why haven't I talked about this on here?
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:26.000]  I mean, I have a lot of contacts in sports, I'll leave it at that.
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:34.000]  And they tell me that nobody is taking in the NFL, but the EU, their doctors are making everybody take it.
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  So all the teams that come to the EU, which is most of the big international teams, they're all making people take the shots and they are dying in mass.
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  Shock video.
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  Quatar soccer player collapses from heart attack on the field.
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  Oh, and there's more.
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  MMA fighter, Muralslav Straubach suffers heart attack during training.
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  Young, healthy, but he did take the shot.
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  Oh, and I know one of the top, he's number one and number two.
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  Grappler's in the world, Craig Jones, he lives in Austin now, so he can't go back to his old country.
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:12.000]  It's a police state now.
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:16.000]  He took the Pfizer shot and he swole up and almost killed him.
[1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:18.000]  So there you go.
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:22.000]  I know what's happened to, oh, but, oh, they don't really want to kill you, right?
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  No, no, no, no, no.
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  They got away with it two years ago and again last year, Democrats announced the same things happening.
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:36.000]  If you do have COVID, they want to send you one place to nursing homes and then no one can come in there, though.
[1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  They'll send positive people there, but family can't go because when the family gets word that they're killing their elderly, they'll get mad.
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:46.000]  So it's like, oh, no, no, only if you have COVID can you come in.
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:50.000]  If the family, we're going to intubate your family member and get $53,000 for murdering them.
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:56.000]  You can't come, but Democrats have announced more plans to murder hundreds of thousands more seniors.
[1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:12.000]  If you only knew the power of the dark side, join Bill Gates and together we will defeat humanity.
[1:16:12.000 --> 1:16:18.000]  Then our gods see the reward us with eternal life.
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:22.000]  That's basically the ethos of the globalists.
[1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:24.000]  They must first play God.
[1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:30.000]  They must first prove that they are the fittest in their social Darwinistic system.
[1:16:30.000 --> 1:16:32.000]  And in a way, they're right.
[1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:40.000]  If we let them lie to us and dumb us down and poison us and destroy our children's futures and the evidence is overwhelming and out in the open,
[1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:43.000]  we deserve what's happened to us.
[1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:49.000]  So I asked you now, are you going to step up and expose the dual order even more?
[1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:53.000]  I know I'm pledging to step up and redouble my efforts.
[1:16:53.000 --> 1:17:19.000]  The front lines of the fight is infowars.com.
[1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:25.000]  It's got in it, cutting edge chicken bone broth protein isolate powder for better flavor and dissolvability.

[1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:48.000]  And it just goes on and on.

[1:17:57.000 --> 1:18:04.000]  Everything we've witnessed in the last few decades has only been the buildup for what the globalists are doing right now.
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:07.000]  This is their big offensive. This is their takeover.
[1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:11.000]  And this is the point that they're at their very weakest because now they've revealed themselves.
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:16.000]  Now their world government, their permanent martial law, their medical tyranny is out in the open.
[1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:19.000]  Their depopulation agenda has been exposed.
[1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:25.000]  But they're using their corporate power and trillions to go across the planet and shut down people telling the truth.
[1:18:25.000 --> 1:18:31.000]  So listen, Paul Revere's, when you spread the word about the broadcast, when you pray for the broadcast, you're the tip of the spear.
[1:18:31.000 --> 1:18:34.000]  And when you buy products at infowarsstore.com, you keep us on air.

[1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:57.000]  Only way we fail is if you don't take action.

[1:19:47.000 --> 1:19:56.000]  Give yourself the gift of health and clarity and focus with X2 and Winter Sun at infowarsstore.com, 50% off for a limited time.
[1:19:56.000 --> 1:20:07.000]  Thanks for keeping us on the air.
[1:20:26.000 --> 1:20:38.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live, and now we're going to hit psychological warfare.
[1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:48.000]  So the first rule of gaslighting somebody is to tell them that nothing is happening.
[1:20:48.000 --> 1:21:03.000]  That's the first rule of the globalist system is to never recognize and never admit that you're abusing somebody.
[1:21:03.000 --> 1:21:12.000]  And then that way, the debate always becomes instead about whether it's happening or not.
[1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:14.000]  Like, are they devaluing the currency?
[1:21:14.000 --> 1:21:19.000]  Just a year ago, oh, no, there's no buying power being lost to the dollar.
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:22.000]  Oh, there's no convicted pedophiles at Drag Queen Storytime.
[1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:24.000]  Oh, there's no open border.
[1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:27.000]  Oh, there's no UN program involved in the open border.
[1:21:27.000 --> 1:21:30.000]  Oh, no, no, no, nobody's spying on you.
[1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:33.000]  Oh, and then years later, everything's happening.
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:35.000]  Everything is in your face.
[1:21:35.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  Everything is being rubbed in over and over and over and over again.
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:48.000]  But then the new projects they're launching, like preparing for a civil war, preparing for gun confiscation,
[1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:51.000]  preparing for a staged massive cyber attack.
[1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:53.000]  Oh, no.
[1:21:53.000 --> 1:22:03.000]  Then you're never supposed to be told about that until it's already launched so that when we're up here on air,
[1:22:03.000 --> 1:22:11.000]  going over all of this, breaking all of this down, they get very, very upset.
[1:22:11.000 --> 1:22:15.000]  Because we're telling you about the next chapter before it comes.
[1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:23.000]  They want to pre-program you, get you ready through incremental manipulation for the next phase of their operation.
[1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:31.000]  And then they want to roll out the reasons they're doing that once you get to that phase of the operation.
[1:22:31.000 --> 1:22:35.000]  And imagine how upset they are that we're still on air.
[1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:37.000]  They're like, what do we do?
[1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:43.000]  I mean, he's telling them everything, and if the public actually listened, they would save themselves.
[1:22:43.000 --> 1:22:47.000]  But they laugh and say, no, no, no.
[1:22:47.000 --> 1:22:53.000]  The general public, even if they know he's right, they don't want to share articles or videos from him because they might get made fun of.
[1:22:53.000 --> 1:22:56.000]  So instead, they'll lose everything they've got.
[1:22:56.000 --> 1:22:58.000]  And the globalists laugh and they giggle.
[1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:01.000]  Let me show you a little overhead shot here if we can.
[1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:06.000]  Here's just a few of the folders that I've got here.
[1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:10.000]  This is lockdown, PSYOP's propaganda.
[1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:13.000]  Now, why is all this so important?
[1:23:13.000 --> 1:23:18.000]  It's governments around the world, from Australia to Spain to the UK to Canada to the US,
[1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:24.000]  admitting that psychological warfare tactics were used to brainwash and scare the public
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:28.000]  and lie to the public for the noble lie of,
[1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:32.000]  well, say five million are going to die in America and a million in the UK,
[1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:35.000]  show you can lock them down so a thousand don't die.
[1:23:35.000 --> 1:23:37.000]  And that itself is a PSYOP lie.
[1:23:37.000 --> 1:23:39.000]  It's not a noble lie.
[1:23:39.000 --> 1:23:40.000]  It's not to save anybody.
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:47.000]  It's about power and control and a World ID and training you to live under martial law and erasing 500 years of renaissance.
[1:23:47.000 --> 1:23:53.000]  So before I get to all of those for you and show you what they don't want you to see,
[1:23:53.000 --> 1:24:00.000]  because see, that's where they're telling you it's good to have military warfare systems of total deception
[1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:03.000]  used against you and your family.
[1:24:03.000 --> 1:24:06.000]  That's when it's positive, like we did it for your own good.
[1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:12.000]  But then when we go, hey, you're under military mind control, here's top experts admitting it.
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:14.000]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:20.000]  That doesn't exist, you see, because they can never validate you waking up or anyone warning you.
[1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:24.000]  They never treat you with respect and actually say, well, there's too many of you.
[1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:25.000]  We need to kill you.
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:30.000]  We need to get you locked down first and shut off all the industry so we can have an organized collapse.
[1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:32.000]  And this is going to be better for you anyways.
[1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:33.000]  You're subhuman.
[1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:37.000]  You know, they don't come and tell you what they really think about because you'd say, well, I'm not subhuman.
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:41.000]  I'm going to organize and stop them and then they couldn't play God.
[1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:43.000]  See how that works?
[1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:50.000]  So they want to get you in a position of total control under them before they take everything away from you.
[1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:52.000]  And that's their plan.
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:56.000]  So here's some of the headlines.
[1:24:56.000 --> 1:24:58.000]  This is from infowars.com.
[1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:00.000]  Damage control.
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:03.000]  I went to Twitter this morning and the top of it.
[1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:05.000]  And I went to Yahoo on the top of it.
[1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  And I went to CNN on the top of it because it's all centralized propaganda.
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:13.000]  Said Joe Rogan and Dr. Malone are liars. They're evil.
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:16.000]  There's no such thing as mob psychology.
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:25.000]  Mass hysteria or mass formation psychosis is what a group of psychiatrists and scientists have been calling it for decades is a technical term.
[1:25:25.000 --> 1:25:26.000]  Oh, no, no.
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:32.000]  They said it's not in the official psychological dictionary of terms that they use.
[1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:37.000]  Oh, well, if it's not an official term, it doesn't matter if Carl Jung talked about it.
[1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:39.000]  It doesn't matter if the military uses it.
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  It doesn't matter if it's a military term they use.
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:43.000]  It doesn't matter if they admit they're using it.
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:48.000]  Just say it's a lie, right?
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:50.000]  So here we go.
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:53.000]  Big huge article on infowars.com.
[1:25:53.000 --> 1:25:54.000]  Damage control.
[1:25:54.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  Reuters AP proclaimed no evidence of mass formation psychosis.
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:09.000]  And they say they talked to five psychologists and they just said it didn't exist.
[1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:13.000]  Reuters, of course, their president is on the board of Pfizer.
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:15.000]  Let's continue here.
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:19.000]  AP got over 200 million last year from Pfizer, but that's okay.
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:21.000]  And here's some of the lives of the past.
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:26.000]  Ex-Prime Minister Tony Blair secretly promised George Bush he'd spin the Iraq war of the world.
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:27.000]  He'd lie.
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:29.000]  Oh, but there's no science.
[1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:35.000]  Sweden to tackle misinformation by psychological means using psychological warfare,
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:37.000]  but insist it's not a ministry of truth.
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:38.000]  Oh, no.
[1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:42.000]  Macron says we're making you uncomfortable to make you take the shot.
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:45.000]  But that's not coercion.
[1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:49.000]  And LinkedIn banned Dr. Robert Malone so you can't contact him or talk to him.
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:51.000]  Oh, well, silencing people.
[1:26:51.000 --> 1:26:53.000]  There's no propaganda.
[1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  They just silenced people to challenge him.
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:26:58.000]  That's not authoritarianism or anything.
[1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:03.000]  Fact Focus unfounded theory used to dismiss COVID measures.
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:11.000]  We've been lied to about everything with COVID from the PCR test to the numbers of the dead to people with preexisting conditions dying of heart attacks and cancer.
[1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:14.000]  But saying it was COVID to the fact that it isn't even a vaccine.
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:20.000]  It's an mRNA therapy and then all the top scientists say it's horrible and dangerous that actually are worth their salt.
[1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  No, you just have Reuters run by Pfizer come out and say it doesn't exist.
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:30.000]  And here's AP fact check, no evidence of pandemic mass formation psychosis says experts speaking to Reuters.
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:37.000]  So Reuters says it isn't mass formation psychosis, but then AP says it doesn't exist.
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:42.000]  So there's no evidence of this thing that exists, but AP says, well, it doesn't exist anyway.
[1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:44.000]  That's a better lie.
[1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:46.000]  There's no Bilderberg group.
[1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:48.000]  There's no dollar devaluation.
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:49.000]  There's no open borders.
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:50.000]  There's no crime increasing.
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:55.000]  Remember when they said we want to defund the police and then they would say, oh, we didn't really say that.
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:27:56.000]  We just want to defund them.
[1:27:56.000 --> 1:28:01.000]  It's all about just training you to be lied to training you to be slapped upside the head.
[1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:02.000]  Here's another one.
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:12.000]  UK culture secretary boast about shadowy anti disinformation unit in the military used to counter the people and silence them.
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:17.000]  And then they've got legislation introduced to arrest anyone that questions health ministers.
[1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:19.000]  Oh, that's not authoritarian or anything.
[1:28:19.000 --> 1:28:24.000]  Yeah, let's not question health ministers and people on the payroll of big pharma.
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:26.000]  No, no.
[1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:38.000]  And I've got some of the history of the madness of crowds and some of the history of mass psychosis, mass hysteria, the madness of crowds.
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:44.000]  I mean, these are terms used for hundreds of years, even before the term psychology got invented.
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:52.000]  Books written about the madness of crowds that then became the basis of mob psychology and psychology, which is in the official psychology books.
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:58.000]  But this is behavioral psychologists using their trade against you.
[1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:06.000]  We've all heard about the pastor and his famous statement from inside a concentration camp in World War Two that when they came for one group,
[1:29:06.000 --> 1:29:08.000]  he wasn't part of that group so he didn't stand up.
[1:29:08.000 --> 1:29:12.000]  And then when they came for another group, he wasn't part of that group so he didn't stand up.
[1:29:12.000 --> 1:29:16.000]  And finally, when they came for him, there was nobody else to stand up.
[1:29:16.000 --> 1:29:21.000]  Well, the Global Social Credit Score that China is putting in, it's banning people to three hours of video games a week.
[1:29:21.000 --> 1:29:24.000]  And if you criticize the government, you can never buy or sell again.
[1:29:24.000 --> 1:29:30.000]  Well, that's being brought here and all over the world under the guise of COVID vaccine passports.
[1:29:30.000 --> 1:29:31.000]  They even admit it.
[1:29:31.000 --> 1:29:34.000]  Now, there's going to be a carbon tax attached to it.
[1:29:34.000 --> 1:29:38.000]  They're going to track where you go and what you do and decide where you can go and what you can do.
[1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:40.000]  That's what the lockdowns are about.
[1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:42.000]  Except that, you'll accept anything.
[1:29:42.000 --> 1:29:48.000]  So again, the left is having fun right now with all the censorship and tyranny pretending like they're part of the power structure.
[1:29:48.000 --> 1:29:51.000]  But they're all going to be targeted by this nightmare as well.
[1:29:51.000 --> 1:29:58.000]  We need to get back to basic human rights and promote them or all of us will be enslaved by this horrible technocracy run by the globalists.
[1:29:58.000 --> 1:30:02.000]  Let's go ahead and take another call. Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee. Welcome.
[1:30:02.000 --> 1:30:03.000]  Hello, Alex.
[1:30:03.000 --> 1:30:04.000]  Yes, Malcolm.
[1:30:04.000 --> 1:30:08.000]  All right, I will make this quick and real short where the other patrons can get on the line.
[1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:12.000]  I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Shroyer.
[1:30:12.000 --> 1:30:15.000]  Supermell Vitality and Brain Force Plus.
[1:30:15.000 --> 1:30:18.000]  Mix those two together. You're an unstoppable tank.
[1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:20.000]  Supermell Vitality really, really works.
[1:30:20.000 --> 1:30:25.000]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[1:30:25.000 --> 1:30:29.000]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions.
[1:30:29.000 --> 1:30:32.000]  They also work quite well, but just aren't as strong.
[1:30:32.000 --> 1:30:34.000]  This is like a very fine wine.
[1:30:34.000 --> 1:30:36.000]  In fact, each batch is different.
[1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:38.000]  Super strong sometimes it's just okay.
[1:30:38.000 --> 1:30:41.000]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[1:30:41.000 --> 1:30:43.000]  That's just how it is. It's how it works.
[1:30:43.000 --> 1:30:47.000]  So it's always good. It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[1:30:47.000 --> 1:30:51.000]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[1:30:57.000 --> 1:31:01.000]  Three very important life-saving words.
[1:31:01.000 --> 1:31:05.000]  Vitamins, minerals, amino acids.
[1:31:05.000 --> 1:31:11.000]  And you find them all in vitamin, mineral, fusion, all the essential vitamins,
[1:31:11.000 --> 1:31:16.000]  all the essential minerals from really good, high quality, absorbable sources,
[1:31:16.000 --> 1:31:25.000]  and a bunch of key compounds, amino acids known to help get the nutrients into your tissues, into your cells.
[1:31:25.000 --> 1:31:28.000]  And despite the fact that the product is going to sell out in the next week or so,
[1:31:28.000 --> 1:31:34.000]  we're going to keep it on sale at 50% off for another seven days.
[1:31:34.000 --> 1:31:39.000]  So again, I am cutting this announcement on the afternoon of January 6, 2022.
[1:31:39.000 --> 1:31:44.000]  We're going to run this for a week and then we are going to be selling out of this product.
[1:31:44.000 --> 1:31:47.000]  Hopefully more comes in in the next month or so because it's the best seller.
[1:31:47.000 --> 1:31:50.000]  And it's something everybody needs for their immune system and their body.
[1:31:50.000 --> 1:32:05.000]  Get your vitamin, mineral, fusion now and support the InfoWare 360WIN at infowarstore.com.
[1:32:21.000 --> 1:32:26.000]  That's why despite the fact that it's selling out at current sales rates,
[1:32:26.000 --> 1:32:31.000]  we're going to keep it on sale for another seven days.
[1:32:31.000 --> 1:32:36.000]  So we're running this until next Thursday and your purchase supports the broadcast.
[1:32:36.000 --> 1:32:39.000]  I want to thank you all for shopping with InfoWars.
[1:32:39.000 --> 1:32:44.000]  Without you, it would not have been on air and the world would be a much worse position right now than it's in.
[1:32:44.000 --> 1:32:49.000]  Thanks to you supporting InfoWars, we have now become the number one beacon of truth
[1:32:49.000 --> 1:32:52.000]  exposing the great reset and the new world order.
[1:32:52.000 --> 1:33:20.000]  So support your immune system and support free speech in the fight for liberty at the same time at infowarstore.com.
[1:33:23.000 --> 1:33:30.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:37.000]  So we have stacks of western governments using military grade deception and propaganda
[1:33:37.000 --> 1:33:43.000]  that was outlawed against its use against Taliban and Al Qaeda.
[1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:45.000]  That's in congressional hearings.
[1:33:45.000 --> 1:33:51.000]  Our government outlawed the use of this level of deception in foreign countries that our military is occupying.
[1:33:51.000 --> 1:33:56.000]  But, oh, it's being used here domestically on us.
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:33:59.000]  And it's the same thing again from Australia to the United States.
[1:33:59.000 --> 1:34:04.000]  The exact same names, the slogans, the programs developed by the behavioral psychologists at the Davos Group
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:09.000]  and the Carnegie Endowment through the CIA, through the military at the highest levels, through the media.
[1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:13.000]  And that's why they are in lockstep with one message.
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:17.000]  And that's why they said, oh, don't call them illegal aliens.
[1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:18.000]  Don't call them invaders.
[1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:22.000]  Call them migrants. Call them non-citizens.
[1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:27.000]  And now the left says, oh, even calling someone a migrant or non-citizen is a hate term.
[1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:31.000]  So now we're just calling it, well, people, anybody here can vote.
[1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:34.000]  Remember just a few years ago, Alex Jones is crazy.
[1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:38.000]  Nobody's going to let illegal aliens vote.
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:43.000]  And he saw New York giving all the illegal aliens driver's license and the rest of it under any name they want
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:45.000]  to then get on the welfare system to bankrupt it.
[1:34:45.000 --> 1:34:49.000]  I'm not even against these poor people that had their countries collapsed by the same globalists,
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:51.000]  but they're being brought in to collapse us.
[1:34:51.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  So Eric Adams, the new New York City mayor, you thought the blouse was bad.
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:35:06.000]  New York City legislation is now the law and he is defending it as the mayor saying illegal aliens can vote
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:14.000]  and get all the welfare, all the services, including most states, are giving illegal aliens higher tuition than citizens.
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:19.000]  It's all part of collapsing the country.
[1:35:19.000 --> 1:35:24.000]  And that, my friends, is PsyOps. That, my friends, is brainwashing.
[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:29.000]  So there's no such thing as mass formation psychosis.
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:35.000]  We just covered that from AP, from Reuters, from the top of Twitter, the top of Instagram.
[1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  Just they want you to know nobody's lying to you.
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:41.000]  Nobody's manipulating you.
[1:35:41.000 --> 1:35:50.000]  Well, here's where the first term of the madness of crowds that then got turned into the mad howl of democracy is another term
[1:35:50.000 --> 1:36:00.000]  used at the time that was then known as mob psychology and then mob psychosis and then mass psychosis by Carl Jung
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:05.000]  and anybody that ever opened a major psychology book knows this.
[1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:11.000]  This is one of the most well-studied things. So many people throughout history have really been into this.
[1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  Jim Morrison did a lot of his graduate work and undergraduate work out in California on mob psychology.
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:24.000]  This is heavily studied, okay?
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:29.000]  I mean, this is the cool thing to study because the globalists are into it, to control you.
[1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:35.000]  They're telling you it doesn't exist, the definition of gaslighting.
[1:36:35.000 --> 1:36:48.000]  So this goes back to a book first written in 1841 called Extraordinarily Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds.
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  And I actually ordered a copy of this today. I've read about it, I've heard about it, but I ordered the unabridged version.
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:37:03.000]  It's really long, it's only $9 on Amazon. And it goes through the madness and the delusion and the mind control and Q-type stuff and everything else.
[1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:16.000]  National delusions, economic bubbles, peculiar follies, alchemists, influence and modern response.
[1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:21.000]  Now, what's the response of the Guardian to this book?
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:31.000]  Oh, they call it a right-wing diatribe. Oh, yeah. There's no such thing as crowd control and mind control.
[1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  Here's another one, people can't post theories anymore. A lot of historians believe that the Salem Witch Trial was caused by that theory.
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:45.000]  What about when the book War of the Worlds was broadcast? Yep, H.G. Wells broadcast by Orson Wells.
[1:37:45.000 --> 1:37:51.000]  On the radio and everyone panicked throughout the world and thought the world was ending. And then, again, they're having to go into Twitter,
[1:37:51.000 --> 1:37:54.000]  they're having to go into Google, they're having to go into History List and everywhere.
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:58.000]  Expunge, because the more you cover up, the more you've got to then cover up more.
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  Like, oh my gosh, we've got to go into Google, we've got to go into the history websites, we've got to get rid of mass psychosis, we've got to take that term out.
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:10.000]  Mass hysteria, it doesn't exist because we said, you see how that war on language, war on ideas works?
[1:38:10.000 --> 1:38:18.000]  And now, you can't talk about that on all these platforms because it doesn't exist. Our dear leader of the New World Order said so.
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:29.000]  How mass hysteria is related to groupthink? Oh my gosh, all these big studies in prestigious universities, but oh, Reuters,
[1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:34.000]  basically owned by Pfizer, says that doesn't exist. There was no mind control, there was no hysteria.
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:42.000]  I just showed you the British Ministry of Defense saying we used illegal mind control techniques to create mass hysteria and total fear.
[1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:46.000]  Those are quotes. Mass hysteria and total fear.
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:52.000]  Oh, but some social media users claim mass formation psychosis has occurred during the pandemic.
[1:38:52.000 --> 1:39:00.000]  Experts in crowd psychology have ever said this is not a term recognized in the field of psychology, nor is there evidence of any such phenomenon.
[1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:10.000]  Oh, no. Oh, no. Here's the book I bought. Extraordinary popular delusions, the madness of crowds. I'll review it here on air.
[1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:15.000]  I said it cost $9. I'm sorry, it cost, I got a paperback, $16.
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:24.000]  Here's Aldous Huxley talking about it. By means of ever more effective methods of mind manipulation, the democracies will change their nature.
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  Point-old forms, elections, parliament, supreme courts, and all the rest will remain. The underlying substance will be a new kind of totalitarianism.
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:38.000]  All traditional names, all the hallowed slogans will remain exactly what they were in the good old days.
[1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:46.000]  Democracy and freedom will be the theme of every broadcast in a tutorial. Meanwhile, the ruling oligarchy and its highly trained elite of soldiers,
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:53.000]  policemen, thought manufacturers, and my manipulators will quietly run the show as they see fit.
[1:39:53.000 --> 1:39:58.000]  But here's someone being bad on Twitter. They probably should be banned. This is Propaganda Sniper says,
[1:39:58.000 --> 1:40:03.000]  I graduated with a degree in psychology from State University in New York in 94.
[1:40:03.000 --> 1:40:13.000]  Mass psychosis was in our textbook, as was MPT. But you're not allowed to talk about it.
[1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:19.000]  Mass formation psychosis isn't real, says the company sponsored by Pfizer.
[1:40:19.000 --> 1:40:26.000]  The AP and Reuters need to be investigated for conflicts of interest and fundraising. As a former journalist, I am now ashamed.
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:31.000]  I took their info as gospel to the Liberty American public without questioning any of its content.
[1:40:31.000 --> 1:40:37.000]  We didn't have a choice back then, but we do now.
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:46.000]  Propaganda doesn't work. It's a pretty bold take, but I wouldn't expect anything less from you morons, says Blair White.
[1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:55.000]  Here's a really good take on it. Do you know why this mass hysteria is happening in America and around the world?
[1:40:55.000 --> 1:41:00.000]  The mass hysteria about vaccines is created by those who launch COVID-19 pandemic.
[1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:11.000]  So everybody will be busy with the vaccine narrative and forget that COVID-19 virus is a bio weapon made in a laboratory.
[1:41:11.000 --> 1:41:17.000]  Talk about gaslighting. Fiery but mostly peaceful protest after police shooting.
[1:41:17.000 --> 1:41:20.000]  They only burned down a couple hundred buildings.
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:24.000]  And then here's a great example for TV viewers who are able to see all this.
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:32.000]  Hilton had posted this January 2nd, 2022 Google search results compared to January 9th, 2022 after the Joe Rogan show,
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:39.000]  where they had to expunge all the psychology departments and all the definition sites so they could tell you a week later it didn't exist.
[1:41:39.000 --> 1:41:43.000]  Mass formation psychosis does not exist.
[1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:50.000]  At first it was hundreds of pages of scholarly reports admitting it exists, but now they say it doesn't exist.
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:57.000]  You see right there? So in just five, six days it goes from existing to not existing.
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:42:00.000]  There you go. Now they're memory holding whole terms.
[1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:04.000]  No evidence you say of mass psychosis, huh?
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:07.000]  Well, what's this? Look at these photos right here.
[1:42:07.000 --> 1:42:12.000]  People in the airports with plastic bags over them with mask over their faces.
[1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:15.000]  These are real photos, not jokes.
[1:42:15.000 --> 1:42:21.000]  This is people on planes, on trains, literally hysterical, under mind control.
[1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:25.000]  But there's no psychological hysteria. There's nothing wrong here.
[1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:28.000]  Nothing's happening. Nobody's taking your rights.
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:33.000]  Justin Trudeau just says people dying from non-medical treatment are dying because people didn't take COVID shots,
[1:42:33.000 --> 1:42:37.000]  when they're the ones that ordered the damn lockdowns and did it all.
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:41.000]  Oh, that's not bullying. That's not psychological warfare. No, no, no.
[1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:45.000]  All right. One more segment of years truly.
[1:42:45.000 --> 1:42:48.000]  And then Christy Lee is loaded for bear with a bunch of huge topics.
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:50.000]  I'll tell you about the moment coming up.
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:53.000]  Final segment of the Alex Jones Show. Straight ahead.
[1:42:53.000 --> 1:43:01.000]  Christmas 2021 is gone. It's in the rearview mirror.
[1:43:01.000 --> 1:43:07.000]  But you can still take advantage of Christmas prices going to the new year at infowarstore.com.

[1:43:58.000 --> 1:44:03.000]  God created each and every one of us with free will.
[1:44:03.000 --> 1:44:07.000]  When we look at the world system now openly announcing the Mark of the Beast,
[1:44:07.000 --> 1:44:13.000]  everything that it's attempting to do is built around getting rid of our free will
[1:44:13.000 --> 1:44:18.000]  and making us bow down and submit and turn our very bodies, our very productivity,
[1:44:18.000 --> 1:44:24.000]  our very genetics, our very future over to them.
[1:44:24.000 --> 1:44:29.000]  They want control of procreation. They want control of the relationships between men and women.
[1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:34.000]  They want to bring a form of living death to our society and our civilization.
[1:44:34.000 --> 1:44:40.000]  All of us were formed and made in God's mind and God's image and given free will.
[1:44:40.000 --> 1:44:45.000]  And make no mistake, all of you alive today were created by God to be alive in this special time
[1:44:45.000 --> 1:44:50.000]  so that you could make the right decision in free will and stand against evil.
[1:44:50.000 --> 1:44:57.000]  And then, for eternity, win the great birthright prize of being alive with God.
[1:44:57.000 --> 1:45:02.000]  In late August, infowar saw an explosion of orders
[1:45:02.000 --> 1:45:08.000]  because our audience understands that the globalists are destabilizing the planet by design
[1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:13.000]  and are attempting to cause an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[1:45:13.000 --> 1:45:17.000]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to have.

[1:46:04.000 --> 1:46:10.000]  criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government are stealing all of your data
[1:46:10.000 --> 1:46:14.000]  and creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do.
[1:46:14.000 --> 1:46:18.000]  So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.

[1:47:25.000 --> 1:47:28.000]  I'm Alex Jones, finishing up here.
[1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:31.000]  Ripping apart the AP hit piece on Dr. Malone.
[1:47:31.000 --> 1:47:36.000]  School board and DOJ won't withdraw memos to target concerned parents as terrorists.
[1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:39.000]  So first they denied the memo, then they defended it, then they said they would withdraw it.
[1:47:39.000 --> 1:47:41.000]  Now they say they're doubling down.
[1:47:41.000 --> 1:47:46.000]  Washington State being able to force you to take the facts in the legislation already.
[1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:50.000]  Forced injection or you go to a camp.
[1:47:50.000 --> 1:47:54.000]  And she has a special guest on this organizing employees around the country
[1:47:54.000 --> 1:48:00.000]  to have a peaceful uprising by uniting against this depopulation.
[1:48:00.000 --> 1:48:05.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, a lot of people ask me, why are they doing this?
[1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:10.000]  Why are they announcing in Germany February 1st door-to-door forced injections?
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:14.000]  They're not going to just let you go to a camp. They're going to make you take it.
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:19.000]  Because there can't be anybody four, five, six years from now as this stuff kicks in when everybody's dying left.
[1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:24.000]  They've got to get almost everybody or there'll be enough people to organize and stop them.
[1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:31.000]  They've got to maim and kill enough people for civilization to totally collapse.
[1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:38.000]  Then they've got underground bases and redoubts and fortresses around nuclear power plants.
[1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:41.000]  So they get power and they'll still have their technicians running it.
[1:48:41.000 --> 1:48:44.000]  They understand that's a problem during collapse. People don't go around the nuclear power plants.
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:48.000]  So the truth is, if you want to know where the globalists are, they're usually within 50 to 100 miles,
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:52.000]  usually closer to nuclear reactors.
[1:48:52.000 --> 1:48:54.000]  And by the way, there's not just the ones you hear about.
[1:48:54.000 --> 1:48:59.000]  They've got a whole bunch of high-tech small ones to run their operations.
[1:48:59.000 --> 1:49:06.000]  And so they're going to release more bioweapons, kill the general population with these poison shots,
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:10.000]  break down society, collapse borders, create hell on the surface,
[1:49:10.000 --> 1:49:15.000]  and then they're going to basically retreat back to their armored redoubts while the majority of us die.
[1:49:15.000 --> 1:49:22.000]  And then they'll come back out as the saviors and start re-establishing some of the towns and cities as they see fit.
[1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:24.000]  And that's the plan. MI6 had a plan to do it.
[1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:27.000]  That's why Ian Fleming wrote the book Moonraker.
[1:49:27.000 --> 1:49:31.000]  They have proposed these plans for a long time.
[1:49:31.000 --> 1:49:34.000]  Because Bertrand Russell wrote about it in two of his books.
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:38.000]  Globalists that they just really love. He got a Nobel Prize.
[1:49:38.000 --> 1:49:46.000]  He said that we needed to have a controlled nuclear war before other countries got the bomb.
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:48.000]  He said this in the 50s.
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:54.000]  And have a UN-run world government that had large, long-range bombers.
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:50:03.000]  They should build several hundred of them and then build thousands of bombs and then bomb London, New York, D.C., Moscow, Tokyo.
[1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:06.000]  And they would go around with their criminal network worldwide.
[1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:09.000]  You can read his book. The left loves this stuff.
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:12.000]  And then they would launch and then hydrogen bomb everybody.
[1:50:12.000 --> 1:50:14.000]  Atomic bomb and then hydrogen bomb everybody later.
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:18.000]  He said when hydrogen was around, he said, well, she's hydrogen. It's cleaner.
[1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:25.000]  And then the utopia could come after they could see the weapons will get too powerful later.
[1:50:25.000 --> 1:50:28.000]  You got to kill everybody early and have a control collapse.
[1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:32.000]  And then just like the Black Plague killed half the population of Europe, some estimates have it that high,
[1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:34.000]  then a new renaissance came out of that.
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:37.000]  So they're just dreaming of mass murder and death and playing God.
[1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:40.000]  So you look that up.
[1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:43.000]  And so that's what they're doing.
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:51.000]  And that's why in, again, a whole bunch of Democrat run states like Michigan and Pennsylvania and New York, you name it,
[1:50:51.000 --> 1:50:53.000]  was like 12 of them.
[1:50:53.000 --> 1:51:00.000]  They sent people with the original bad COVID into the nursing homes where they could finally get a positive.
[1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:04.000]  And once there was a positive, they would then intubate and get 53,000.
[1:51:04.000 --> 1:51:10.000]  But it wasn't just about 53,000 for the nursing homes and groups to murder somebody.
[1:51:10.000 --> 1:51:12.000]  That was the money for them to do it and be corrupted.
[1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:17.000]  It was the globalist testing death panels and getting rid of old people that Bill Gates had called for.
[1:51:17.000 --> 1:51:23.000]  That's why FEMA has sent strike teams to Pennsylvania as hospitals face overwhelming number of patients.
[1:51:23.000 --> 1:51:24.000]  Strike teams.
[1:51:24.000 --> 1:51:30.000]  Oh, and I've got articles about strike forces to forcibly inject or take you to camps.
[1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:32.000]  Covered that at the start of the show.
[1:51:32.000 --> 1:51:35.000]  See, now you're going to hear more and more about strike teams.
[1:51:35.000 --> 1:51:42.000]  What did the UN head of rapid reaction force said? He said a year ago, plus we need strike teams.
[1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:45.000]  What did Prince Charles said a few months ago?
[1:51:45.000 --> 1:51:52.000]  He said we need a military force for the great reset to collapse civilization and wage a war against the planet's main threat.
[1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:53.000]  And that's us.
[1:51:53.000 --> 1:51:57.000]  I mean, declaration of war.
[1:51:57.000 --> 1:51:59.000]  That's what I'm telling you, folks.
[1:51:59.000 --> 1:52:03.000]  And here's an example of them murdering people.
[1:52:03.000 --> 1:52:08.000]  Connecticut asked nursing homes to accept COVID positive patients from hospitals.
[1:52:08.000 --> 1:52:16.000]  New York's massive nursing home death toll as a result of similar Democrat policy going unheeded by bureaucrats.
[1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:18.000]  It's not going unheeded.
[1:52:18.000 --> 1:52:20.000]  They went to Bill Gates meetings.
[1:52:20.000 --> 1:52:21.000]  They've been told they're being promoted.
[1:52:21.000 --> 1:52:22.000]  They get giant raises.
[1:52:22.000 --> 1:52:23.000]  The more people they murder.
[1:52:23.000 --> 1:52:24.000]  I got it.
[1:52:24.000 --> 1:52:26.000]  Some of these nursing homes, they kill up to 100 people.
[1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:29.000]  That's 53,000 money.
[1:52:29.000 --> 1:52:33.000]  You can hire a good hitman for that, even with inflated money.
[1:52:33.000 --> 1:52:37.000]  Seriously, they are murdering our families.
[1:52:37.000 --> 1:52:38.000]  They're murdering us.
[1:52:38.000 --> 1:52:39.000]  They love it.
[1:52:39.000 --> 1:52:40.000]  Oh, sorry.
[1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:43.000]  None of you in the Democrat states can come to see your loved ones.
[1:52:43.000 --> 1:52:49.000]  And then inside, maybe they're running those lines, blowing those lungs out.
[1:52:49.000 --> 1:52:50.000]  Good.
[1:52:50.000 --> 1:52:51.000]  Keep them alive for five days.
[1:52:51.000 --> 1:52:53.000]  That's when the insurance runs out.
[1:52:53.000 --> 1:52:55.000]  This one's got about two weeks of insurance.
[1:52:55.000 --> 1:52:58.000]  And they just murder you with enjoyment.
[1:52:58.000 --> 1:52:59.000]  So liberal.
[1:52:59.000 --> 1:53:00.000]  So liberal.
[1:53:00.000 --> 1:53:01.000]  So trendy.
[1:53:01.000 --> 1:53:02.000]  So laughing.
[1:53:02.000 --> 1:53:08.000]  And the trial lawyers will do nothing because they know only attack when they're told Democrat
[1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:10.000]  lawyers are pedophile cultists, half of them.
[1:53:10.000 --> 1:53:13.000]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[1:53:13.000 --> 1:53:16.000]  So that's how it works, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:17.000]  That's how it works.
[1:53:17.000 --> 1:53:22.000]  The Connecticut Department of Public Health is requesting nursing homes to take in COVID-positive
[1:53:22.000 --> 1:53:27.000]  patients to alleviate hospital overcapacity after they fired the nurses and doctors.
[1:53:27.000 --> 1:53:31.000]  That's really, until yesterday, the state of the required hospitalization.
[1:53:31.000 --> 1:53:34.000]  COVID pays us to test negative before being discharged.
[1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:39.000]  But this new guidance waives that requirement, thanks to Governor Ned Lamont's executive
[1:53:39.000 --> 1:53:40.000]  order.
[1:53:40.000 --> 1:53:44.000]  Nobody got in trouble for it, so now they're going to kill even more.
[1:53:44.000 --> 1:53:46.000]  Oh, but you got to stay six feet apart.
[1:53:46.000 --> 1:53:47.000]  You got to wear a mask.
[1:53:47.000 --> 1:53:52.000]  Even though you test negative, you can't see mom or dad or your uncle or your brother
[1:53:52.000 --> 1:53:54.000]  or your sister.
[1:53:54.000 --> 1:53:58.000]  The murder of logic.
[1:53:58.000 --> 1:54:03.000]  Because Bill Gates said, if we kill old people, we can hire 10 teachers.
[1:54:03.000 --> 1:54:05.000]  Every old person you kill, hire 10 teachers.
[1:54:05.000 --> 1:54:12.000]  As if, what, 10 teachers that teach their kids how to die and wear a mask?
[1:54:12.000 --> 1:54:16.000]  And you know, if they tell family, say, you can't see your dad, and dad dies, the families
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:20.000]  will wear their mask and feel good and say, thank you, the very nurse saying, I understand,
[1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:25.000]  over the phone, hang it up and go, I just made a massive cash murder in that old man.
[1:54:25.000 --> 1:54:29.000]  And they're just building their armies and their forces.
[1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:33.000]  And the doctors and scientists and medical workers that aren't satanic and evil, they
[1:54:33.000 --> 1:54:34.000]  all get fired.
[1:54:34.000 --> 1:54:35.000]  They get removed.
[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:37.000]  And now they're all out of the hospital.
[1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:38.000]  They're out of the nursing home.
[1:54:38.000 --> 1:54:41.000]  And now the real murder can start.
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:44.000]  20,000 at least murdered in New York.
[1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:47.000]  And now the murdering is going to start.
[1:54:47.000 --> 1:54:49.000]  The real murdering.
[1:54:49.000 --> 1:54:53.000]  And no one will do anything.
[1:54:53.000 --> 1:54:58.000]  Because, well, of course they're dancing in those empty hospitals.
[1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:00.000]  There's a back on that back ward.
[1:55:00.000 --> 1:55:02.000]  Well, nobody's allowed in.
[1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:03.000]  Money getting made.
[1:55:03.000 --> 1:55:05.000]  Money getting made.
[1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:06.000]  Murder and grandma.
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:07.000]  Woo!
[1:55:07.000 --> 1:55:08.000]  Yeah.
[1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:09.000]  We're liberal.
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:10.000]  We're cool.
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:11.000]  We kill old people.
[1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:12.000]  Yeah, liberal.
[1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:13.000]  We kill babies.
[1:55:13.000 --> 1:55:14.000]  We kill children.
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:16.000]  We like drag queen story time.
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:18.000]  We like open borders.
[1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:19.000]  We like salty.
[1:55:19.000 --> 1:55:21.000]  We like bio weapons.
[1:55:21.000 --> 1:55:22.000]  We love death.
[1:55:22.000 --> 1:55:26.000]  Liberal, liberal, liberal, liberal, liberal, liberal.
[1:55:26.000 --> 1:55:29.000]  And the average one doesn't even think they're so dumb the nurses that don't quit.
[1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:32.000]  Because we've had nurses with whistleblowers on where they're like bringing homeless and
[1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:33.000]  are totally healthier.
[1:55:33.000 --> 1:55:34.000]  You sick?
[1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:35.000]  No, I feel great.
[1:55:35.000 --> 1:55:37.000]  Three days later, they're dead.
[1:55:37.000 --> 1:55:38.000]  Don't even have COVID.
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:41.000]  They just stain them down.
[1:55:41.000 --> 1:55:46.000]  I mean, literally, like a harm of just jamming tubes down.
[1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:50.000]  They're turning them up twice as high as they're supposed to, just murdering them.
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:52.000]  And that's what's really going on.
[1:55:52.000 --> 1:55:53.000]  And they're going to murder you.
[1:55:53.000 --> 1:55:55.000]  And they're going to take your property.
[1:55:55.000 --> 1:55:58.000]  And while you're dead, they're going to rape your little boys and little girls because
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:55:59.000]  they like it.
[1:55:59.000 --> 1:56:02.000]  And they're the Democratic Party type individuals.
[1:56:02.000 --> 1:56:04.000]  They're the Republican leadership that goes along with them.
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:10.000]  And they're the same scum all over the country and all the world that love it and enjoy it
[1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:12.000]  and are going to continue.
[1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:16.000]  Oh, but don't worry, the mayors and the governors that go along with the mass murder, they won't
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:17.000]  get in any trouble.
[1:56:17.000 --> 1:56:20.000]  A few of them might have, they asked a girl out on a date.
[1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:21.000]  That's the real crime.
[1:56:21.000 --> 1:56:25.000]  Oh, oh, that creepy weirdo governor asked women out.
[1:56:25.000 --> 1:56:26.000]  So he's gone because of that.
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:31.000]  Not because he lied and murdered 20,000 people, because he was ordered to do that.
[1:56:31.000 --> 1:56:32.000]  He's a puppet.
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:33.000]  All right.
[1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:35.000]  Christy Lee's going to take over.
[1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:39.000]  If you want to keep us on air, you want to help stop the new world order, plus you want
[1:56:39.000 --> 1:56:40.000]  to boost your immune system.
[1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:43.000]  So these murderers, you know, don't have their way with you.
[1:56:43.000 --> 1:56:45.000]  I'll go to infowarstore.com right now.
[1:56:45.000 --> 1:56:51.000]  Only a few days left on vitamin, real fusion at 50% off and X2 is 50% off the deep earth
[1:56:51.000 --> 1:56:52.000]  crystal iodine.
[1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:53.000]  Get away.
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:54.000]  Get angry.
[1:56:54.000 --> 1:56:55.000]  Say no to the new world order.
[1:56:55.000 --> 1:56:59.000]  Ultimate bone broth discounted brain force.
[1:56:59.000 --> 1:57:04.000]  Plus all of it is there infowarstore.com.
[1:57:04.000 --> 1:57:06.000]  But the one selling out is vitamin mineral fusion.
[1:57:06.000 --> 1:57:08.000]  X2 has been sold out for months.
[1:57:08.000 --> 1:57:10.000]  It's now back in 50% off.
[1:57:10.000 --> 1:57:14.000]  If you do one thing, folks, I would take X2 and vitamin mineral fusion.
[1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:15.000]  But bodies is amazing.
[1:57:15.000 --> 1:57:17.000]  It's there as well infowarstore.com.
[1:57:17.000 --> 1:57:18.000]  And I'm not joking.
[1:57:18.000 --> 1:57:19.000]  This is all real.
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:21.000]  I mean, how are you not supposed to just illustrate it?
[1:57:21.000 --> 1:57:24.000]  They're literally going to murder hundreds of thousands of old people again in front of
[1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:26.000]  everybody because it's not an accident.
[1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:28.000]  It's not bureaucrats ignoring it.
[1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:32.000]  They want to lock down the, the, the, the nursing homes and not let you in while they

[1:58:54.000 --> 1:58:58.000]  When we look at the world system now, openly announcing the Mark of the Beast,
[1:58:58.000 --> 1:59:03.000]  everything that it's attempting to do is built around getting rid of our free will
[1:59:03.000 --> 1:59:08.000]  and making us bow down and submit and turn our very bodies, our very productivity,
[1:59:08.000 --> 1:59:14.000]  our very genetics, our very future over to them.
[1:59:14.000 --> 1:59:16.000]  They want control of procreation.
[1:59:16.000 --> 1:59:19.000]  They want control of the relationships between men and women.
[1:59:19.000 --> 1:59:24.000]  They want to bring a form of living death to our society and our civilization.
[1:59:24.000 --> 1:59:30.000]  All of us were formed and made in God's mind, in God's image and given free will.
[1:59:30.000 --> 1:59:35.000]  And make no mistake, all of you alive today were created by God to be alive in this special time
[1:59:35.000 --> 1:59:40.000]  so that you could make the right decision in free will and stand against evil.
[1:59:40.000 --> 1:59:49.000]  And then, for eternity, win the great birthright prize of being aligned with God.
[1:59:49.000 --> 1:59:57.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
