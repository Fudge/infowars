[00:00.000 --> 00:13.960]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.960 --> 00:33.520]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones well I got up
[00:33.520 --> 00:42.760]  this morning to some happy tidings John Boehner the Supreme Rhino the man who's been blocking
[00:42.760 --> 00:48.880]  the repeal of partial birth abortion the man who's been blocking the repeal of Obamacare
[00:48.880 --> 00:55.920]  is going to resign in October it was Congressman Walter Jones in the last year that really
[00:55.920 --> 01:03.880]  launched the move to organize a movement to remove Boehner from the speakership he was
[01:03.880 --> 01:10.360]  on with us about a month ago they moved in the house to try to block a vote to remove
[01:10.360 --> 01:14.120]  Boehner or to call for a leadership change and they learned they didn't have the votes
[01:14.120 --> 01:19.600]  so they had to stand down since then there have been major movements beneath the surface
[01:19.600 --> 01:26.880]  of the waters to remove him so believe me you're going to get the absolute inside baseball
[01:26.880 --> 01:33.280]  coming up in the second hour with Congressman Walter Jones of North Carolina a true patriot
[01:33.280 --> 01:41.320]  he's also trying to release the 28 pages of the 9-11 report showing the Saudi Arabia quarterback
[01:41.320 --> 01:46.360]  the attacks bare minimum that's why info wars is so important we broke the Benghazi
[01:46.360 --> 01:52.280]  Stinger missile story first we've been the spearhead on countless other issues and the
[01:52.280 --> 01:59.080]  system is afraid of us because we can push a story that isn't getting attention into
[01:59.080 --> 02:04.720]  the mainstream and it's been my job to try to get other people up and running and other
[02:04.720 --> 02:08.720]  organizations up and running so that we're not the only organization that can effectively
[02:08.720 --> 02:13.080]  do this obviously out of self preservation but more importantly out of the fact that
[02:13.080 --> 02:19.280]  we need more people of where what's happening and taking action and that's why I put out
[02:19.280 --> 02:26.000]  a video that I taped last night at like 8 o'clock at night that we launched this morning that's
[02:26.000 --> 02:32.320]  on info wars dot com red linked Obama plans to shut down news organization now they tried
[02:32.320 --> 02:36.840]  to shut down news corps they tried to shut down rush limbaugh I mean they had him arrested
[02:36.840 --> 02:43.160]  for Viagra remember and I'm not a total fan of limbaugh and limbaugh's for the police state
[02:43.160 --> 02:46.280]  even though it's attacked him and I'm up against limbaugh and all the rest of it but I don't
[02:46.280 --> 02:51.720]  have fantasies that if limbaugh had a heart attack or limbaugh was arrested I'd be filling
[02:51.720 --> 02:55.720]  his shoes because there's all these idiots out there that go if we bring down alex jones
[02:55.720 --> 03:04.200]  we'll get his audience no it'll dissipate fools it's just crazy but if we don't hang
[03:04.200 --> 03:09.160]  together we hang separate to quote benjamin franklin I said support rush limbaugh when
[03:09.160 --> 03:15.920]  he was under attack and when he was being boycotted I said don't let Obama indict news corps for
[03:15.920 --> 03:21.700]  the hacking scandal because whether it happened or not this white house is so criminal it's
[03:21.700 --> 03:25.720]  trying to shut down the free press and if they can take down limbaugh or they can take
[03:25.720 --> 03:31.760]  down rupert murdoch they can take down anybody dinesh desuza got thrown in prison for nine
[03:31.760 --> 03:36.720]  months for doing something that wasn't even illegal if you look at the statutes they have
[03:36.720 --> 03:42.080]  indicted the Texas attorney general who was fighting Obama the word is they're investigating
[03:42.080 --> 03:49.520]  the governor and I have that from the highest levels the governor's followed around everywhere
[03:49.520 --> 03:57.360]  they're digging through Abbott's garbage this isn't a game there is a war on the press it's
[03:57.360 --> 04:05.840]  unprecedented and I had an FBI source over a year ago and another one as well that was
[04:05.840 --> 04:11.840]  more of an informant threatening me on a separate issue but an FBI source inside and you know
[04:11.840 --> 04:15.640]  we get all these documents my act homeland security I mean we really get these we're
[04:15.640 --> 04:19.960]  willing to put them out other folks get them too they're just too scared and they said
[04:19.960 --> 04:24.480]  listen I don't know what's going on but you are under major surveillance and the feds
[04:24.480 --> 04:28.400]  have been told dig something up on you and so you're being given this warning and I know
[04:28.400 --> 04:32.560]  you don't think you're doing anything wrong but man don't speed and you know just watch
[04:32.560 --> 04:41.200]  your butt well they couldn't dig anything up they thought it'd be too political so then
[04:41.200 --> 04:47.000]  they went to the federal trade commission and they went to about other commissions to
[04:47.000 --> 04:51.880]  have them dig in and that's what they've been doing is running around with white gloves
[04:51.880 --> 04:56.640]  trying to find something to come after us and hey obviously we've hit the big time it's
[04:56.640 --> 05:01.600]  a great badge of honor you've heard of clock kid right the boy who removed the insides
[05:01.600 --> 05:05.320]  of a digital clock put it in a suitcase then brought it to school to show his teachers
[05:05.320 --> 05:09.320]  when people got suspicious he claimed he didn't know anything refused to talk to police then
[05:09.320 --> 05:14.080]  gets invited to the White House we'll get ready now we have Pope kid that's right the
[05:14.080 --> 05:18.080]  Daily Mail reports five-year-old daughter of illegal immigrants is blessed by Pope after
[05:18.080 --> 05:22.880]  breaking through security barricades hours after he says mass in Spanish Sophia Cruz
[05:22.880 --> 05:26.620]  was part of a crowd of thousands lining the papal route in Washington DC to catch a glimpse
[05:26.620 --> 05:30.520]  of the pontiff as he passed she got over police barricades and ran out into the street in an
[05:30.520 --> 05:34.120]  attempt to approach the Pope mobile she happened to have a letter and a yellow t-shirt that
[05:34.120 --> 05:38.560]  read Pope rescued Dapa so the legalization would be your blessing makes you wonder with
[05:38.560 --> 05:43.920]  all the security theater around how a five-year-old could get through hmm maybe it's staged of
[05:43.920 --> 05:47.600]  course every five-year-old's got a letter ready and a t-shirt printed up nothing weird
[05:47.600 --> 05:52.040]  about that back to the clock kid did you know his sister was suspended for reportedly threatening

[08:11.600 --> 08:18.680]  this is not a new world it is simply an extension of what began in the old one it is patterned
[08:18.680 --> 08:23.440]  itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages
[08:23.440 --> 08:29.680]  of history since the beginning of time it has refinements technological advances and
[08:29.680 --> 08:35.640]  a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom but like every one of the
[08:35.640 --> 08:48.080]  super states that preceded it it has one iron rule logic is an enemy and truth is a menace
[08:48.080 --> 08:54.760]  this is Mr. Romney Wordsworth in his last 48 hours on earth he's a citizen of the state
[08:54.760 --> 09:00.400]  but will soon have to be eliminated because he's built out of flesh and because he has
[09:00.400 --> 09:10.920]  a mind Mr. Romney Wordsworth who will draw his last breaths in the twilight zone ladies
[09:10.920 --> 09:15.160]  and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us it is the Friday worldwide transmission
[09:15.160 --> 09:24.880]  the 25th day of September 2015 of course we'll return to the Sunday Lord willing 4 to 6 p.m.
[09:24.880 --> 09:29.120]  I will be hosting the Sunday transmission David Knight and Cari Jackson will be reporting
[09:29.120 --> 09:36.080]  from New York City today in the third hour and joining me Sunday as well we have Congressman
[09:36.080 --> 09:41.880]  Walter Jones who spearheaded the movement to have John Boehner step down people lost
[09:41.880 --> 09:46.560]  their committee memberships their committee chairmen ships they were targeted election
[09:46.560 --> 09:52.600]  money war chest were piled up to remove them from office but Walter Jones of North Carolina
[09:52.600 --> 09:58.400]  led the charge and will be giving us the inside scoop on why Boehner announced this morning
[09:58.400 --> 10:07.080]  that he will be resigning from Congress in October Congressman Jones was on with us one
[10:07.080 --> 10:13.280]  month ago this week one month ago Wednesday so 32 days ago and he broke down the fact
[10:13.280 --> 10:18.320]  that they had the votes to get it out of committee they were going to try to move to have a vote
[10:18.320 --> 10:26.360]  to block it but Boehner didn't have the votes and so didn't know what to do well now the
[10:26.360 --> 10:30.560]  word is you'll get it directly from Congressman Jones is they had the votes they were going
[10:30.560 --> 10:37.880]  to move next week to remove him this is another devastating victory against the globalist
[10:37.880 --> 10:43.920]  the fight now goes to who will go in the ascension of the speaker ship if the neocons and the
[10:43.920 --> 10:48.160]  rhinos will be able to block the Tea Party rebellion who the Democrats and Republicans
[10:48.160 --> 10:54.440]  have combined forces together to block that's why the Tea Party has been audited indicted
[10:54.440 --> 11:02.960]  harassed that's why military veteran organizations have been harassed it's why anyone who is
[11:02.960 --> 11:09.160]  a basic classic American has been under attack is because they know we're popular they know
[11:09.160 --> 11:13.640]  we have the cure to globalist tyranny they know that we can bring this country back to
[11:13.640 --> 11:18.920]  greatness and the globalists are moving on every front to finish this country and Europe
[11:18.920 --> 11:25.560]  once and for all so the great battle has now been joined many people just want to go through
[11:25.560 --> 11:31.240]  life and be left alone many people don't have confidence in themselves so even if they're
[11:31.240 --> 11:37.680]  being bullied they'll put up with it I caught myself this morning after I did some elliptical
[11:37.680 --> 11:45.880]  lifting weights absolutely enthusiastic and happy and proud of myself and satisfied to
[11:45.880 --> 12:02.840]  a degree that I have never been I felt so manly so honorable so good that my conscience
[12:02.840 --> 12:12.400]  was giving me a type of energy I've never felt in my life because when I got some of
[12:12.400 --> 12:17.840]  the news in the last year and more news yesterday confirming it that there's a major FBI white
[12:17.840 --> 12:23.240]  collar crime task force directly under Obama and the Justice Department the Attorney General
[12:23.240 --> 12:31.360]  with upwards of 20 people working 15 hours a day to find out some way to put me in prison
[12:31.360 --> 12:38.520]  and to shut down info wars I wasn't scared when I confirmed it but I still was upset
[12:38.520 --> 12:44.440]  by it my mind was working I didn't lose any sleep about it and then this morning I was
[12:44.440 --> 12:48.000]  just thinking about all the innocence being chopped up all the babies I was thinking about
[12:48.000 --> 12:54.280]  the globalist destabilizing all these countries the fluoride in the water the cancer viruses
[12:54.280 --> 13:01.080]  and the vaccines and how they want to keep their war quiet underground their geoengineering
[13:01.080 --> 13:06.080]  basically invisible they want to carry out their operation with everybody just in a trance
[13:06.080 --> 13:13.440]  and the mere fact that we reach over a billion people a month via social networks we have
[13:13.440 --> 13:18.400]  that from Google's own analytics we actually show it in the video that's on info wars.com
[13:18.400 --> 13:23.440]  Obama plans to shut down news organization the fact that we reach hundreds of millions
[13:23.440 --> 13:29.920]  of people every month on different video platforms a million people a day on a podcast five million
[13:29.920 --> 13:35.600]  people a day now on radio I mean it really is massive and the globalist already know
[13:35.600 --> 13:41.880]  it's massive and I knew launching a TV network that's going to grow slowly and just be a
[13:41.880 --> 13:46.600]  new avenue in their dinosaur brains would really freak them out and scare them and it
[13:46.600 --> 13:54.720]  certainly has but thinking about my forebearers thinking about the founding fathers thinking
[13:54.720 --> 13:59.680]  about the founders of Texas thinking about my ancestors in England and the things they
[13:59.680 --> 14:07.440]  did I just really in my gut in my spirit understood that I was beginning to approach the stairs
[14:07.440 --> 14:14.680]  to their ranks and that's the most valuable thing in the world it didn't fancy cars or
[14:14.680 --> 14:20.480]  big houses or hot tubs or Caribbean beaches that matter in the final equation it is being
[14:20.480 --> 14:28.800]  honorable it is standing up for what's right it's being a good person and it is upholding
[14:28.800 --> 14:35.400]  your family name and I can truly be proud of what I've done not on some power trip not
[14:35.400 --> 14:40.320]  in an arrogant way I've always felt like I haven't done enough I've always felt like
[14:40.320 --> 14:45.440]  I haven't gone far enough and if you notice I've turned the heat up as of late I've really
[14:45.440 --> 14:52.040]  gotten aggressive and really said what I think and gone to a whole nother level of aggressiveness
[14:52.040 --> 14:59.080]  because I knew in my gut that that was the right thing to do and my gut my spirit said
[14:59.080 --> 15:05.280]  right back to my conscious mind yes now you're lined up with God now you're doing what you're
[15:05.280 --> 15:14.360]  supposed to do and with that it will draw down the fire of the enemy but that is expected
[15:14.360 --> 15:25.080]  we're losing everything we're becoming enslaved we're becoming soulless because we have been
[15:25.080 --> 15:32.760]  intimidated we have been cowed we have been trained to cower on our knees on our bellies
[15:32.760 --> 15:38.680]  licking the boots of the system and then we see the arrogance the craziness the hutzpah
[15:38.680 --> 15:45.200]  the bravada the hubris of the elite and it's just mind blowing Hillary Clinton looks like
[15:45.200 --> 15:51.160]  a breeze would blow her over Janet Yellen's having many strokes on TV and can hardly talk
[15:51.160 --> 15:58.640]  we're simply ruled by piles of trash because we've given in to fear of them and the black
[15:58.640 --> 16:06.560]  uniforms and the jack boots and all the rest of it and I can really say I am free I knew
[16:06.560 --> 16:16.240]  when I crossed the threshold bullhorning Bilderberg in 2006 and they sent Richard Holbrook out
[16:16.240 --> 16:23.520]  when I did it I could feel I was passing a line to another level of opportunity for freedom
[16:23.520 --> 16:28.840]  but also danger and I loved every minute of it and I've passed other lines as well but
[16:28.840 --> 16:38.560]  launching a TV network that'll take years to grow is only a sign to them to remind them
[16:38.560 --> 16:45.840]  of the indomitable human spirit that refuses to submit it only reminds them of human empowerment
[16:45.840 --> 16:51.400]  and empowered individuals and the fact that we don't cower and fear to the system they
[16:51.400 --> 16:56.640]  can't stand that and so they know full well if word gets to me and what's going on I'll
[16:56.640 --> 17:00.600]  come on there and talk about it and they think you're cowards and that you're then going
[17:00.600 --> 17:05.400]  to roll over and fear and not become involved because oh my gosh the big bad government
[17:05.400 --> 17:11.280]  might come get you let me explain something we've gone from one in 25,000 to one in 58
[17:11.280 --> 17:17.520]  with autism the CDC saying by 2025 one in three maybe one and two they already came
[17:17.520 --> 17:21.800]  for us they came for our kids they already killed 55 million babies they already keep
[17:21.800 --> 17:27.200]  them alive and sell their organs they already came for us they've put fluoride in the water
[17:27.200 --> 17:32.200]  for 60 years massive IQ reductions massive cancer increases Harvard even admits it they
[17:32.200 --> 17:39.080]  already came for us we already got pancreatic cancer liver cancer cancer of the bladder
[17:39.080 --> 17:45.120]  cancer of the kidneys up multi thousand percent they already came for us they already drove
[17:45.120 --> 17:50.480]  down our wages shut off our power plants got rid of our jobs destroyed our culture and now
[17:50.480 --> 17:56.280]  we're on the news again this time mainstream British newspapers legitimizing pedophilia
[17:56.280 --> 18:02.840]  yesterday they're promoting pedophilia on TV as if it's good they already came folks they
[18:02.840 --> 18:14.440]  already got us we're already slaves and my very cells my cells cannot go along with this
[18:14.440 --> 18:21.080]  I am a slave to standing up to tyranny I'm a slave to conscience I'm a slave to Jesus
[18:21.080 --> 18:27.000]  Christ but I chose to be you people that are slaves to evil I don't even know what planet
[18:27.000 --> 18:31.400]  you think you're living on what a pathetic God you serve you cowards you think you're
[18:31.400 --> 18:37.920]  being given power on this planet to carry out evil you will pay in this life and you will
[18:37.920 --> 18:47.000]  pay in the next you don't believe in God to know when you do bad stuff it comes back
[18:47.000 --> 18:54.000]  on you and so at the bottom of the hour I'll play the report I'm talking about that I shot
[18:54.000 --> 18:58.800]  in one piece unedited they put some articles over it just to document what I'm talking

[25:06.120 --> 25:15.400]  each other look it up that's why they're indicting tea party governors and tea party attorney generals
[25:15.400 --> 25:21.400]  and tea party filmmakers i don't agree with michael moore's politics but if they set him up
[25:21.400 --> 25:28.120]  politically and arrested him for some little chicken stuff i would defend michael moore vehemently
[25:29.880 --> 25:34.840]  not a word from him about denisha susa being thrown in prison for getting five friends to
[25:34.840 --> 25:40.280]  give to a senate campaign and not setting up a pack to do it totally legal he just didn't dot an i

[26:26.360 --> 26:34.200]  that's part of company entertainment and try to put people in jail while the sec and others
[26:34.200 --> 26:38.200]  knew for years about burning madeoff and did nothing they know all about the big banks
[26:38.200 --> 26:45.000]  laundering drug money and do nothing the the cia runs the major drug cartels our troops are made
[26:45.000 --> 26:52.040]  to grow the opium in afghanistan on record but if they catch your teenage daughter or son with one
[26:52.040 --> 26:59.560]  shot of heroin five years in prison a ruined record and when they get out they got a five-year
[27:00.920 --> 27:06.520]  education and criminal operations a five-year degree

[27:15.320 --> 27:24.040]  controlled supreme court as the crazy train goes right over the cliff and we've got
[27:26.280 --> 27:34.920]  a justice department that shipped over 20 000 firearms into mexico to demonize the second
[27:34.920 --> 27:40.920]  amendment and run a false flag cbs news even got the memo i was saying it was clearly a false
[27:40.920 --> 27:44.520]  flag they got it saying this is going to be used to blame the second amendment and restrict
[27:44.520 --> 27:49.160]  firearm ownership that's the plan to field agents who were getting upset and didn't want to be part of
[27:49.160 --> 27:55.240]  it and you know what they did to the report that broke it from cbs news they fired her
[27:56.920 --> 28:04.360]  but you know what she has her honor she's a good person we have the biggest war on the press
[28:05.800 --> 28:13.320]  this country has ever seen by barack hussein obama i mean that's admitted by jonathan turley
[28:13.320 --> 28:16.360]  there's been a guest on the show the liberal constitutional scholar
[28:18.600 --> 28:26.520]  it's a fact that obama has jailed more journalists and gone after more whistleblowers than all
[28:26.520 --> 28:33.960]  modern presidents in the last hundred years together since those laws were on the books
[28:34.760 --> 28:37.160]  the trading with the enemy act the sedition act all of it
[28:37.160 --> 28:44.200]  but because he's black it's supposedly trendy so it's okay
[28:50.760 --> 28:55.560]  does anyone feel safe having a government like this does anyone feel safe with the president
[28:55.560 --> 29:00.040]  outside of law just shuts down a thousand plus power plants and increases our power prices and
[29:00.040 --> 29:04.360]  gives general electric waivers to make huge profits because they're not under it does anyone
[29:04.360 --> 29:11.240]  feel safe with states all over just starting forced inoculation even outside of law because
[29:11.240 --> 29:16.520]  laying down to these people is what's got us to this position the reason america had lower taxes
[29:16.520 --> 29:20.760]  was freer everybody wanted to move here was the people wouldn't put up with tyranny and would
[29:20.760 --> 29:27.880]  fight back against it we were known as fighters and so we had prosperity really that's all america
[29:27.880 --> 29:32.280]  had was the fact we were fighters we had a lot of problems but there were constantly brush wars
[29:32.280 --> 29:36.760]  constantly people standing up against corrupt government local state federal constant fights
[29:36.760 --> 29:43.640]  with the railroads americans didn't bend over that's why we were great now we've gone from the greatest
[29:43.640 --> 29:49.960]  to some of the most servile people in the world and it's time to stop it we're on the march the
[29:49.960 --> 30:01.640]  empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network k daniels info wars dot com did you know
[30:01.640 --> 30:06.360]  that pope francis has strong ties to communism francis is a member of the jesuits who developed
[30:06.360 --> 30:11.640]  the so-called liberation theology which many have labeled christianized marxism the other reason why
[30:11.640 --> 30:16.600]  communism and socialism has persevered for so long in latin america and it's not a coincidence that
[30:16.600 --> 30:22.680]  cuba's current leader ral kastro prays pope francis for his anti-capitalist stance kastro like francis
[30:22.680 --> 30:27.960]  was also brought up by the jesuits starting to make sense now why francis is constantly calling for
[30:27.960 --> 30:32.680]  carbon taxes and more government and also did you know the recent reconciliation between the u.s
[30:32.680 --> 30:38.040]  and cuba was spearheaded by pope francis to the benefit of kastro vatican researcher leo zagami

[35:33.720 --> 35:39.640]  it they haven't tweeted back yet when his son mike norris there's a big filmmaker in his own
[35:39.640 --> 35:48.680]  right was here in studio with us he went ahead and openly said that his dad told him point blank
[35:48.680 --> 35:53.320]  you get involved in the liberty movement oh there it is we did tweet it son real elix jones
[35:53.320 --> 36:00.760]  with info or shirt he said get ready for him to come and try to kill you or set you up or indict
[36:00.760 --> 36:06.040]  you but he said i'm very proud of what you're doing and his son told that story sitting right
[36:06.040 --> 36:11.000]  next to me here a few months ago because they're putting a movie out about a martial law takeover
[36:11.000 --> 36:20.520]  in america that i'm in and you better believe that their family has been put under a lot of pressure
[36:20.520 --> 36:27.080]  as well this is what goes on in this so-called free country in america chuck norris told his son
[36:27.080 --> 36:27.640]  mike norris
[36:31.000 --> 36:35.480]  who learned how to ride motorcycles with steve mcqueen americana patriot

[36:43.800 --> 36:45.400]  that's what's really going on in america
[36:45.400 --> 36:53.640]  and most people are intimidated i would be intimidated by putting my tail between my legs
[36:53.640 --> 36:59.480]  and giving into it because that's scarier than having them pull me over plant drugs on me
[37:03.240 --> 37:09.800]  god knows what they're going to make up god knows and i just see it as a foregone conclusion i don't
[37:09.800 --> 37:18.760]  want it to happen but what brings me solace is just accepting it i consider myself to be dead already
[37:20.200 --> 37:22.200]  and i'll tell you that's when you're really alive
[37:26.280 --> 37:29.400]  i remember i was talking to my uncle a few months before he got sick and died last year
[37:30.360 --> 37:36.200]  so it was in 2013 i was talking to him he died in january of 2014 and he'd been at a lot of secret
[37:36.200 --> 37:40.920]  helicopter operations and special forces shot down seven times he never even told us that to be dug
[37:40.920 --> 37:46.840]  through his his army chest one time when he was at work and i was driving along with him talking
[37:46.840 --> 37:50.760]  about the death threats and the dirty tricks and he said i said you know though the great part is
[37:50.760 --> 37:55.000]  god gives me comfort i just turn it off and think that i'm basically dead already he looked at me he
[37:55.000 --> 38:04.840]  goes that's what you've got to do and that's the way he said it it was like i he totally understood
[38:04.840 --> 38:10.520]  what i was saying i understood what he was saying and that's what it's really all about i'm dead
[38:10.520 --> 38:19.240]  already and that's when you're really alive folks is when you're dead already there's nothing they
[38:19.240 --> 38:24.920]  can take from me now not my children not my name nothing i know that i've stood for what's right
[38:24.920 --> 38:29.400]  and what's good and all the haters and all their agents and all their minions that have failed
[38:29.400 --> 38:37.480]  so many times before i believe in my heart of hearts you'll fail yet again but whatever comes out of
[38:37.480 --> 38:44.440]  this in the final equation i've stood for what's right and what's just and more people need to do
[38:44.440 --> 38:51.880]  that today and more people need to tell their friends and family about info wars dot com
[38:53.000 --> 38:56.760]  and the forbidden information what the system doesn't want you to have more people need to
[38:56.760 --> 39:01.960]  become bold and stand up because they can't stop us all and they know that's happening now they know
[39:01.960 --> 39:05.960]  the military is blowing the whistle they know people inside government are telling the truth
[39:05.960 --> 39:10.040]  they know the truth is coming out and i can look in the eyes of the new world order and i can tell
[39:10.040 --> 39:17.080]  you they're scared and they should be because the truth and justice is coming and they cannot
[39:17.080 --> 39:22.440]  shut us all up and the spirit of america is rising to face this tyranny are we really going to put
[39:22.440 --> 39:30.920]  up with a war on the press in this nation let's go to my report obama is working on shutting down
[39:30.920 --> 39:39.720]  major independent american news operation and again i have this directly from multiple sources
[39:39.720 --> 39:46.440]  this is going on this is what they're up to this is how they're operating this is what they're doing
[39:46.440 --> 39:51.640]  and it's all about the shutdown of information so they can fully take down this country and take
[39:51.640 --> 39:58.520]  your pension funds and gut the borders further and take down this civilization and i want to ask
[39:58.520 --> 40:05.640]  you the question are you going to put up with it because groveling and giving into this has only
[40:05.640 --> 40:13.640]  made it worse here is the report and at the end i'll add some points that i didn't have in the report
[40:13.640 --> 40:23.320]  i need to write some notes on this because it was point blank that they want to shut down this
[40:23.320 --> 40:30.040]  operation or wound it or keep it from reaching more people or keep it from growing because
[40:30.040 --> 40:35.720]  they understand that we're a conduit that can force major stories out i mean walter jones is coming
[40:35.720 --> 40:41.320]  on with us next hour the congressman who came on this show and went on others but but admitted this
[40:41.320 --> 40:48.280]  show is one of the main groups you the audience of the power you are the people and that you coming
[40:48.280 --> 40:55.320]  on and you supporting what we're doing and you coming on board is the reason that he believed
[40:55.320 --> 40:59.720]  a month ago that baner would be stepping down and now it's happened do you understand that
[41:01.240 --> 41:08.360]  in a sea of passive people in an ocean of cowards in an ocean of brain-numbed zombified sheeple
[41:08.360 --> 41:17.000]  info wars is a gathering place a focal point for millions of people that will stand up against
[41:17.000 --> 41:22.040]  the bullies and the crooks are scared they've committed so many crimes have been so arrogant
[41:22.040 --> 41:30.200]  their backs against the wall they're committed to their cause and all its evils and god always
[41:30.200 --> 41:36.360]  does this before a nation is judged the evil is brought out in the open the people are given a
[41:36.360 --> 41:39.720]  choice whether they're going to go with it or stand against it and you're all being given your
[41:39.720 --> 41:45.400]  choice right now if america doesn't repent now and turn back and if the churches don't stop being
[41:45.400 --> 41:50.280]  government institutions and if the military and the police and the fbi and the rest of you
[41:50.280 --> 41:55.080]  don't start speaking out more and putting your careers on the line more to tell the truth and to
[41:55.080 --> 42:00.120]  blow the whistle we're going to be judged worse than germany was by the end of world war two
[42:00.120 --> 42:05.480]  when one third of the germans were killed you don't really see that on the news but that's in
[42:05.480 --> 42:16.040]  the history books i can assure you that if this goes through within a decade they're going to purge
[42:16.040 --> 42:21.480]  everyone that serve them and help bring the system in probably sooner you will be in the exact same
[42:21.480 --> 42:28.520]  position as the attorney general of texas has been indicted and all the red dinesh to susan
[42:28.520 --> 42:36.200]  everybody else in america we now face the soviet nkvd level thuggery look in germany you criticize
[42:36.200 --> 42:41.400]  the open borders there they have reactivated the stasi that's mainstream german news and have them
[42:41.400 --> 42:48.280]  putting people in jail for 120 days and or 5 000 euro fines for saying you don't like open borders
[42:48.280 --> 42:59.160]  that's the cultural Marxism they mean business folks and i'm not intimidated by them i'm not
[42:59.160 --> 43:07.000]  going to hide in some corner waiting for them or or grovel to the system in the hopes they back off
[43:07.000 --> 43:12.840]  this is an illegitimate system by every yardstick it's committed so many crimes the fbi crime lab
[43:12.840 --> 43:18.760]  i've had the former head of it on admitting it was totally manufactured the whole system is rotten
[43:18.760 --> 43:23.400]  and evil it doesn't mean everybody in it is evil but from the top it's evil
[43:25.480 --> 43:32.280]  and it isn't fit to clean out a porta potty much less execute justice we've now reached
[43:32.280 --> 43:37.640]  this crisis and they plan to use this societal constitutional crisis to collapse the old system
[43:37.640 --> 43:44.040]  completely and bring in complete tyranny that makes this tyranny look like a cakewalk let's go to
[43:44.040 --> 43:51.160]  the special breakdown where i go over all of this and again it's key to understand
[43:52.120 --> 43:59.880]  the white house tasked the fbi texas division that sector to dig up stuff couldn't do it
[43:59.880 --> 44:04.440]  then they didn't want to be political they went to the ftc and around to some other federal agencies
[44:04.440 --> 44:11.560]  to sheet dip that it's directly out of the white house in the justice department and now they've
[44:13.160 --> 44:19.160]  got a fbi task force working for the federal trade commission with whole rooms of senior people
[44:20.280 --> 44:26.520]  and when they do something like that they will make something up so i say politically you've
[44:26.520 --> 44:31.000]  already filled your hand that's what this is all about folks you don't think george washington all
[44:31.000 --> 44:35.880]  them when they saw the declaration of independence didn't know what they were doing i know what i'm
[44:35.880 --> 44:42.200]  doing so don't i take that pleasure away from you that you think i'm like you and i'm a coward
[44:42.200 --> 44:58.360]  i'm not a coward let's go to this report here it is a few years ago the pentagon issued a report
[44:58.360 --> 45:04.520]  containing research dealing with controlling domestic populations here in the united states
[45:05.160 --> 45:09.240]  and they weren't worried about communists they weren't worried about radical islamists they
[45:09.240 --> 45:15.000]  weren't worried about conservatives or liberals or even peace activists they were concerned about
[45:15.000 --> 45:23.160]  what they called empowered individuals who were taking action peacefully in the society
[45:23.160 --> 45:31.480]  to change the status quo what is the status quo the status quo is a rapid consolidation
[45:31.480 --> 45:37.320]  of wealth by the elite through crony capitalism and the public being domesticated via systems of
[45:37.320 --> 45:44.280]  socialism the status quo is the breakdown of the family the status quo is the end of our borders
[45:44.280 --> 45:49.960]  the status quo is our government funding radical jihadist all over the middle east and africa and
[45:49.960 --> 45:58.760]  central asia to destabilize christian areas and to kill other minority groups now it was about a
[45:58.760 --> 46:09.480]  year ago that a fbi source an fbi individual contacted me to let me know that everything i was
[46:09.480 --> 46:16.280]  doing was being monitored and surveilled and it was a very credible individual and then today
[46:16.280 --> 46:23.240]  today i got contacted by an extremely credible individual many people out there would know their
[46:23.240 --> 46:31.400]  name that the obama administration has had enough of info wars and is worried about the fact that
[46:31.400 --> 46:37.400]  we are empowering people that we are empowered individuals and that we are bringing people
[46:37.400 --> 46:47.320]  together and that they've got the entire operation lined up and ready to pull a search and seizure
[46:47.320 --> 46:54.200]  news cameras whole nine yards raid on info wars now the whole point of that is like the cases with
[46:54.200 --> 46:59.560]  the amish where they sell their neighbor cheese and then the feds swat team and put their head on
[46:59.560 --> 47:04.280]  the ground and they've got helicopters it's to create the perception that you must really be a
[47:04.280 --> 47:10.760]  bad guy but people see through that now but it doesn't matter they believe we have the full faith
[47:10.760 --> 47:16.280]  and credit of the u.s federal government so we can do whatever we want we can commit any crime we
[47:16.280 --> 47:21.320]  want we can get away with it we can have planned parenthood openly sell baby parts and we can see
[47:21.320 --> 47:27.000]  babies fighting scalpels with their hands alive out of the womb and it's okay nobody's going to get
[47:27.000 --> 47:36.040]  in trouble some folks back in the 40s early 40s in western europe thought that too and
[47:36.040 --> 47:41.640]  my grandfathers weren't afraid of those bullies and i'm not afraid of you and that's what this
[47:41.640 --> 47:48.360]  comes down to i feel empowered i feel strong and i feel absolutely committed to telling the
[47:48.360 --> 47:57.080]  truth and exposing what's happening but reportedly they have a fbi task force one directly under
[47:57.640 --> 48:02.360]  the head of the fbi in dc the major white collar crime task force that goes after
[48:02.920 --> 48:06.600]  lakosa nostri you name it they don't go after the federal reserve that actually runs the drugs or
[48:06.600 --> 48:13.480]  launters the money the golden sacks jp morgan of course not or wells fargo and they've got them in
[48:13.480 --> 48:18.440]  there whole rooms of men and women just pouring over everything and their fake informants and all
[48:18.440 --> 48:23.720]  the rest of it to try to manufacture something and that's the word they're very confident that they
[48:23.720 --> 48:30.280]  can raid this facility and make something up so go ahead you've already committed to who you are
[48:30.280 --> 48:35.560]  you've already committed to what you stand for i know what i stand for i know what i've done
[48:36.600 --> 48:41.800]  and anything you pull out of a hat is just that a rabbit trick and folks know you're a magician
[48:41.800 --> 48:45.960]  the public isn't like children anymore where they're three years old and believe a rabbit really
[48:45.960 --> 48:50.360]  came out of the hat there's a table with a trap door you put the hat on it you open it and put
[48:50.360 --> 48:59.000]  the rabbit up in and then pull it out and you know my source was saying well by doing this
[48:59.000 --> 49:04.120]  it may put a fly in their ointment because you know they want to be able to have an old hollywood
[49:04.120 --> 49:11.640]  style and i said you know i'm not even going to come out and talk about this because of that i mean
[49:11.640 --> 49:18.360]  i trust in god just like george washington did i think about how he faced 40 50 000 troops landing
[49:18.360 --> 49:23.720]  in the north and 30 40 000 landing in the south and another 30 40 000 coming in a month later
[49:23.720 --> 49:27.960]  i mean they were burning down folks's houses they were killing everybody i mean i'm nothing compared
[49:27.960 --> 49:33.720]  to the forebearers of this nation but my ancestors were there and were involved in it all and they
[49:33.720 --> 49:41.400]  were greater men than i and so i'm here facing a bunch of discredited evil people who have a bunch
[49:41.400 --> 49:46.840]  of cowards amongst their midst who are compartmentalized who are going along with this and so
[49:47.560 --> 49:52.680]  what i face is nothing compared to my ancestors so i have no fear
[49:54.680 --> 49:59.080]  i only hope that i can try to measure at least partially up to what they did
[50:01.240 --> 50:05.080]  now it was also said when i called a couple of my lawyers that are pretty high-powered and smart
[50:05.080 --> 50:09.160]  they said you know this could be a way to further try to discredit you you know they
[50:09.160 --> 50:13.800]  write those articles where you said jade helmet be martial law and it wasn't but of course you
[50:13.800 --> 50:17.800]  didn't say that and uh where the end of the world was coming in september you didn't say that but
[50:17.800 --> 50:24.920]  they say you said that i'd be careful on this because it takes a lot to have an administration
[50:25.720 --> 50:33.880]  come after the press and this is really a bold move if they do this but they had to concede
[50:33.880 --> 50:41.000]  we've seen a record reign of terror on mainline reporters on whistleblowers and so this is really
[50:41.000 --> 50:47.000]  part of the climate we're going into i hope this is just people jerking my chain i hope this is just
[50:48.200 --> 50:55.720]  folks trying to get a reaction because regardless of whether this is real or not real people in the
[50:55.720 --> 51:06.520]  fbi continue to contact me to say this is coming this is being done be ready be ready
[51:06.520 --> 51:10.600]  i have outside accounting firms that do all the accounting i can't even balance my own checkbook
[51:11.240 --> 51:16.120]  i'm not a math guy i have two outside firms one that does it one that audits it everything's
[51:16.120 --> 51:21.160]  transparent uh there's in fact that's nothing you sit back and you think what is it they're
[51:21.160 --> 51:25.880]  going to cook up one of my lawyers says it'll probably be supplements but you've got outside
[51:25.880 --> 51:31.320]  lawyers you use outside top facilities that produce it for you uh you're a private labeler
[51:31.320 --> 51:39.000]  for your formulas um that's probably oh that's the other big kicker it's the federal trade commission
[51:40.200 --> 51:46.040]  the fpc and when i heard that i remembered the fact that i was on the phone with mark cuban
[51:46.040 --> 51:51.160]  and only talked to him a couple times and he was going to put out a film that i'd produced
[51:51.160 --> 51:56.520]  exposing saudi involvement in 911 which is now basically admitted the 28 pages and he called
[51:56.520 --> 52:00.920]  back a few days later to the hollywood producer and said i can't do this now he was going to put
[52:00.920 --> 52:06.360]  it on 1100 screens and put it in stores everywhere you know the host of shark tank owner of the mavericks
[52:07.240 --> 52:14.280]  he said they called me up the bush ftc and said we're going to put you in prison for insider
[52:14.280 --> 52:19.640]  trading for putting this film out and it was sec he said listen i got a family i'm not going to be
[52:19.640 --> 52:28.200]  involved in this uh wow this is really deep and he came out and apologized in the news for talking
[52:28.200 --> 52:35.960]  about putting out loose change a year later new york times comes out with an email not just a call
[52:35.960 --> 52:41.400]  with the fed saying we're going to indict you for insider trading because you put this film out
[52:41.400 --> 52:49.320]  out or you're talking about it that's how crazy and on a power trip these feds are that they would
[52:49.320 --> 52:55.080]  call a guy worth five billion dollars on the phone and email him and say we're going to put you in
[52:55.080 --> 53:02.360]  prison for talking about putting this film out and then he still gave in to him got on his knees
[53:03.240 --> 53:07.800]  and they still came and tried to indict him not once but twice he didn't do insider trading
[53:07.800 --> 53:13.320]  listen i know martha stewart i know you've written the federal laws where taking a crap in your own
[53:13.320 --> 53:19.560]  toilets illegal i know that you've you know got this whole thing set up with your fake grand juries
[53:19.560 --> 53:25.560]  and your federal juries all the rest of it don't ever think that i got into this not knowing mistakes
[53:26.440 --> 53:32.440]  don't ever think i got into this not knowing criminals run this country now i mean hell you
[53:32.440 --> 53:39.560]  people are in baby part business you keep babies alive and sell their organs you protect the people
[53:39.560 --> 53:44.680]  that do that dinecore and haliburton that's come out are in the child trafficking rings
[53:45.800 --> 53:51.240]  you people bring the narcotics in i mean you don't think i don't know that i just always love how
[53:51.240 --> 53:58.920]  you try to intimidate me and you act like i don't know i know i have a moral responsibility to stand
[53:58.920 --> 54:06.840]  up to you and i will continue to do it and i may be destroyed in the process that's part of god's
[54:06.840 --> 54:14.920]  plan but in the final equation my listeners and my viewers are the empowered people and they're the
[54:14.920 --> 54:23.400]  power of info wars dot com they're the power of liberty and freedom i'm not the person that's
[54:23.400 --> 54:29.160]  important and they're not going to go away and they'll know in their hearts that whatever it is
[54:29.160 --> 54:36.200]  you're going to make up is a load of manure this isn't the fbi and the cia and the ns say
[54:36.200 --> 54:41.800]  a 30 years ago when you still have the public trust you don't have it trust and you're just moving
[54:41.800 --> 54:47.400]  forward with america's inertia as if this can go on forever the head of defense intelligence
[54:47.400 --> 54:54.360]  the general and the deputy head of the cia have all gone public in the last two months saying our
[54:54.360 --> 54:59.640]  government ordered them to aid al-qaeda and isis and that it's evil and they're fixing intelligence
[54:59.640 --> 55:05.640]  our military is standing up and doing the right thing and they know that all started here four or
[55:05.640 --> 55:11.080]  five years ago again it's about empowerment it's about people believing doing the right thing can
[55:11.080 --> 55:18.760]  change the world and i don't believe it i know it and so i'll tell you right now my gut tells me
[55:18.760 --> 55:24.280]  we're going to get more orders more purchases more support more am and fm affiliates more tv
[55:24.280 --> 55:30.680]  affiliates more support than we've ever gotten before because of what is reportedly being tried
[55:30.680 --> 55:36.440]  right now and if you actually try to cook something up no one's going to buy it except for your
[55:36.440 --> 55:44.760]  except for your little stable of kept blackmailed controlled uh juries and grand jurist but a lot
[55:44.760 --> 55:48.520]  of juries aren't corrupt a lot of judges aren't corrupt as well you know i think about
[55:49.720 --> 55:55.560]  joe banister who i first interviewed back in like 1999 highly decorated great career
[55:56.600 --> 56:01.160]  federal treasury agent you know doing raids on people he hears the show about the federal
[56:01.160 --> 56:05.080]  reserve being proud of the iris being a scam he doesn't believe it he sets out to disprove it two
[56:05.080 --> 56:09.640]  years later goes in talks to his bosses he says i've this looks like it's true they said just resign
[56:10.600 --> 56:14.280]  that wasn't enough then they indicted him not once but twice
[56:16.280 --> 56:21.880]  for tax fraud for giving speeches about it in america and both juries found him not guilty so
[56:21.880 --> 56:29.320]  you see i only begin to join the ranks of incredible men like him and and erwin schiff and federal
[56:29.320 --> 56:35.560]  president for exposing the iris i mean this is what it's all about and when i die when they
[56:35.560 --> 56:41.320]  bury me six feet under when i'm pushing daisies i'm not going to be listed with all the cowards
[56:41.320 --> 56:45.320]  over there that went along with being a bunch of parasites and gangs who feel so safe and
[56:45.320 --> 56:50.840]  they're cowardice part of their little crews and that's what this comes down to we are about human
[56:50.840 --> 56:56.040]  empowerment and i know it shook them up the money bomb i mean you know how much money we have to
[56:56.040 --> 57:02.360]  bring to run this that's nothing i know it shook the system up to know that we've got 1.4 1.6

[57:33.880 --> 57:39.480]  i've chosen the side i'm on and that's where i am forever and it is a fulfilling feeling

[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:28.840]  one comment or comments that obama's enemies list is about 53 percent of the population yeah
[01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:38.040]  we see massive persecution against the press against whistleblowers
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:43.880]  we see massive establishment media demonization of info wars.com

[01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:58.120]  it's beautiful congressman jones uh was going to be on right now he wants to come on after
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:03.640]  bainer's statement has bainer come out to make a statement yet not yet we're waiting the minute the
[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:08.600]  live feed comes just take over and put him on of course this morning at about seven o'clock central
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:14.600]  because i was online doing research right when it popped up on drudge report dot com
[01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:19.960]  house speaker john bainer to resign from congress in october bainer has been a congressman for
[01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:25.560]  three decades now they want to try to organize because the neocons are losing strength fast
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:33.800]  and the rhinos to put a successor just as bad as him in so that's the big fat fight bainer went on
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:40.200]  to say there's nothing left to accomplish i guess obama cares in power plants are shut down
[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:48.600]  the borders are wide open isis is running wild the gender training bathrooms are going in
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:51.400]  the media is promoting pedophilia
[01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:57.800]  katlyn jenner's um woman of the year i mean just everything's wonderful
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:04.680]  isn't that just special isn't that just sweet isn't that just darling
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:10.280]  i want to again go to break here in a moment come back with bainer's statement that said
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:15.640]  to happen any moment and then we have cars and walter jones coming on who spearheaded
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:22.040]  the movement under massive attack from inside the republican party and from without with the democrats
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:34.760]  to destroy him and that's the reason they're coming after the tea party is because we've got a real
[01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:41.080]  shot at curing the globalist disease the tea party isn't perfect the republicans have tried to take
[01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:46.680]  it over they weren't fully capable of doing that weren't fully successful every time they take one
[01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:51.000]  group over and other would just pop up and so now they're killing it from every different angle and
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:57.080]  it's still not working and so now they're just going after myself tenacious is a patriot governors
[01:02:57.080 --> 01:03:03.480]  patriot attorney generals around the country the texas attorney general was fighting obama on every
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:09.880]  front and so they just had their minion democrats at the state level and died him for nothing being
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:14.520]  at dinner and telling folks about what he thought a good investment was and not disclosing at dinner
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:19.720]  wonder who he's having dinner with that he was involved with the company i mean that's the type of
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:27.240]  crazy town stuff while the white house does stuff five thousand times ten thousand times worse literally
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:33.560]  and let's just say it's illegal what he did you could twist some interpretation of that out
[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:38.120]  he says it's politically motivated we told you about it before it even happened
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:45.080]  it's just crazy
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:53.400]  it's absolutely crazy how out of control this whole country and this whole world has gotten
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:59.320]  and the globalists are making their move right now because they're scared i never even
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:02.600]  in the whole last hour he was kept a break i got to quit doing that
[01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:09.800]  i didn't even plug anything it's absolutely imperative that you understand that they hate
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:14.680]  what we do because it's effective and it's absolutely imperative you understand that it cost a massive
[01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:21.960]  amount of money to have the radio tv satellites the crew the writers the editors the the insurance the
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:27.960]  customer service the researchers the investigative journalists the camera people just the list goes
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:34.920]  on and on the lawyers to run this operation we do it on the chiefs but it's still very expensive
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:39.960]  we need to be strong in the face of these attacks we need to be well fed well trained going into this
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:44.040]  big battle with the globalists so i want to thank you all for your support your prayers

[01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:05.720]  a digital clock put it in a suitcase then brought it to school to show his teachers when people got
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:09.960]  suspicious he claimed he didn't know anything refused to talk to police then gets invited to the
[01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:15.400]  white house well get ready now we have pope kid that's right the daily mail reports five-year-old
[01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:20.120]  daughter of illegal immigrants is blessed by pope after breaking through security barricades hours
[01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:24.840]  after he says mass in spanish so fia cruz was part of a crowd of thousands lining the papal
[01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:28.760]  route in washington dc to catch a glimpse of the pontiff as he passed she got over police
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:32.360]  barricades and ran out into the street in an attempt to approach the pope mobile she happened
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:36.840]  to have a letter and a yellow t-shirt that read pope rescued dappa so the legalization would
[01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:40.840]  be your blessing makes you wonder with all this security theater around how a five-year-old could
[01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:46.360]  get through hmm maybe it's staged of course every five-year-olds got a letter ready and a t-shirt
[01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:50.680]  printed up nothing weird about that back to the clock kid did you know his sister was suspended

[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:21.880]  is c span uh that will help our children and their children we're now on track to cut government spending
[01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:27.400]  by 2.1 trillion dollars over the next 10 years they always say that we've made the first real
[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:33.320]  entitlement reform in nearly two decades and we've protected 99 percent of the american people from
[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:37.720]  an increase in our taxes he's gonna say mission we've done all this with a democrat in the white
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:44.600]  house so i'm proud of what we've accomplished but more than anything my first job as speaker is to
[01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:52.520]  protect the institution oh a lot of you know that uh now know uh that my plan was to step down at the
[01:08:52.520 --> 01:09:01.240]  end of last year i decided uh in november of uh 2010 that when i was elected speaker that
[01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:07.000]  serving two terms would have been plenty this is face saving he's been driven out but in june
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:13.240]  of last year when it became clear that the majority leader lost his election i'd frankly
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:18.760]  didn't believe it was right uh for me to believe at the end of last year congressman jones coming
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:25.480]  on with the truth end of this year so i planned uh actually on my birthday november 17th uh to
[01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:32.600]  announce that i was leaving at the end of the year uh but uh it's become clear to me that uh this
[01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:38.680]  prolonged leadership turmoil uh would do uh irreparable harm to the institution well he's
[01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:43.160]  being halfway honest so this morning i informed my colleagues that uh i would resign from the
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:50.120]  speakership and resigned from congress at the end of october now as you've often heard me say uh this
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:56.040]  isn't about me it's about the people it's about the institution no the leadership battle exposes
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:59.880]  what a trader you are the awesome site with your other leadership princess addressing
[01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:05.480]  the greatest legislative body in the world and i hope that we will all
[01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:11.240]  uh heat his call to live by the golden rule oh my gosh but last night last night i started to think
[01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:17.640]  about this and uh this morning i woke up and i said my prayers as i always do pure bold and i
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:24.280]  decided you know today's what i'm gonna do this as simple as that uh that's the code i've always
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:30.040]  lived by if you do the right things for the right reasons like obama here will happen and i know
[01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:35.800]  uh good things lie ahead for this house uh in this country and i'm proud of what we've accomplished
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:41.880]  especially proud of my team there's a rat in a sinking ship in here my 25th year here and i've
[01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:48.200]  succeeded in large part because uh i've put a staff together in a team together many of which
[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:53.720]  have been with me for a long time and uh and without a great staff uh you can't be a great
[01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:59.480]  member and you certainly can't be a great speaker i'm gonna thank uh my family for putting up with
[01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:06.600]  this uh all these have will bearers of tissues seven and thirty five uh their first uh campaign
[01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:16.040]  photo uh was in uh july of 1981 and so uh they've uh they've had to endure all this it's one thing
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:22.040]  for all the millions for it i've got thick skin uh but uh you know the girls of my wife uh they've
[01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:29.400]  had to put up with a lot over the years uh he's using them as a shield let me express well my
[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:37.480]  gratitude always gonna cry to my constituents who've sent me here 13 times over the last uh
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:46.200]  25 years uh you can't get here without without getting votes uh but uh and i i said this often
[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:52.280]  people ask me what's the what's the greatest thing uh about being speaker or about being an
[01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:57.160]  elected official and i said what's the people you get to meet you know i've met tens of thousands
[01:11:57.160 --> 01:12:01.560]  of people in my own congressional district that i would never have met other than the fact that
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:07.400]  i decided to run for congress and over the years as i traveled on behalf of my colleagues in the
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:13.880]  party i've met tens of thousands of additional people all over the country and you meet rich
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:18.760]  people you meet poor people you meet interesting people and probably a few boring ones along the
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:28.120]  way uh but i can tell you that 99.9 percent of the people i meet uh on the road anywhere
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:34.520]  that could not be could not be nicer uh than uh than they've been it's uh it's been it's been really
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:44.360]  it's been wonderful uh it's been an honor to serve in this institution and with that all right junior
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:51.640]  go ahead speaker bainer you were noticeably overcome with emotion yesterday really oh what a surprise
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:59.400]  there was a standing ovation at a values voter summit as rubio announced bainer's resignation
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:04.680]  there's video of that from c span yes it was a wonderful day really was and uh was i emotional
[01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:11.880]  yesterday i think i was uh i was really emotional in a moment that really no one saw
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:20.360]  oh as uh the pope and i were getting ready to exit the building oh no we found ourselves alone
[01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:27.480]  and uh the pope uh grabbed my left arm and and says in very kind words to me about
[01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:34.520]  uh my commitment oh my gosh you should start crying put it back on for kids and education
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:41.160]  oh he's completely mentally ill now pope puts his arm around me and kind of pulls me to him and says
[01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:48.040]  please pray for me well who am i to pray for the pope but i do the marxist pope
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:55.240]  it's all just egomaniacs and listen there's never about the vote all right he's crying because he's
[01:13:55.240 --> 01:14:00.120]  on such a power trip i could survive a vote i don't want my members to have to go through this
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:05.960]  i certainly don't want the institution to go through this so he's got the tissue out
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:10.520]  thinking about walking out the door anyway so i mean i got a tear in my eyes i'm not
[01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:15.640]  aborted babies this guy's just like comfortable doing that mr speaker i've heard you say before
[01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:21.000]  that a leader who doesn't have anybody's following him it's just the guy taking a walk right i got
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:28.120]  plenty of people i got plenty of people following me uh but uh this turmoil that's been uh churning
[01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:32.760]  now for a couple of months uh it's not good for the members and it's not good for the institution
[01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:40.680]  and uh if i wasn't planning on leaving here soon uh i can tell you i would not have done it if i
[01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:48.120]  if i may just continue there are people who are on the right in your caucus and even outside of
[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:53.560]  this institution who have been wanting you to step down for some time who feel that they have a victory
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:15:00.200]  today oh you feel that you that you were pushed out no uh the members uh uh look i'm glad i made
[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:06.280]  this announcement at the conference with all of my republican college uh because uh it was a it was
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:13.960]  a very good moment uh to help kind of rebuild the team uh listen i feel good about what i've done
[01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:20.520]  um i know that i every day uh i've tried to do the right things for the right reasons and try to
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:26.920]  do the right thing for the country how can you just not do the moment of turmoil you said you
[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:32.760]  thought about leaving two years ago after a time you said this would have pushed the house in turmoil
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:38.040]  yet the government hoping in a couple of days debt ceiling there's going to be well i'm going to be
[01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:44.840]  here for another part of leadership i'm going to be here for another five weeks and uh i'm not not
[01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:49.480]  going to leave uh and i'm going to sit around here do nothing for the next 30 days there's a lot of
[01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:54.680]  work that needs to be done and i oh yeah i plan on getting as much of it done as i can like protecting
[01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:59.560]  obama from all his crimes keeping obama care in keeping the abortion going blocking the abortion
[01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:06.280]  ban votes doing all the evil things you do and making sure one of your minions gets in i would
[01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:11.240]  have made regardless of this there's now an all out leadership scramble happening with some members
[01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:16.840]  of your bar right flank and some outside groups you use words like knuckleheads and some other words
[01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:21.720]  we probably can't use they don't like obama care we're knuckleheads had you just had enough
[01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:26.920]  and how will anything be different for the no no i let me tell you uh i would not describe it as
[01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:36.840]  about as having had enough and that's not it at all when you're the speaker of the house you can't
[01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:41.400]  move the ball down the road for the new world order anymore you're a symbol of evil just like the
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:47.720]  attorney general was and having a vote like this in the institution i don't think is very healthy
[01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:54.440]  and so i've done everything i can over the my term as speaker to strengthen the institution
[01:16:54.440 --> 01:17:01.480]  and then frankly my move today uh is a there's another step in that effort to strengthen the
[01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:09.720]  institution that's my question mr speaker how will washington be different because you
[01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:15.640]  leave this institution what what should people watching this expect the house and congress to
[01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:22.360]  do going forward if you're not here well if we if the congress stays focused on the american
[01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:28.760]  people's priorities there will be no problem at all and uh and while we have differences between
[01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:34.200]  democrats and republicans uh the goal here is one of the leaders is to find the common ground
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:39.400]  listen i talked to foreign banks want triple prices of health care and cut quality i thought you
[01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:43.720]  helped ram it through and protected uh leaders though i have a very good relationship with
[01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:47.640]  my parent who wants to sell eight month old babies the leaders have to be able to chop them up sell
[01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:54.360]  their organs you protect it uh to find the common ground to get things done uh and uh so the congress
[01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:59.240]  gets things done it's important to the american people i can't listen anymore of this we'll we'll
[01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:04.120]  come back to some of it after the break i just want to remind listeners that the tea party

[01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:08.040]  heard our commercials about wallets that protect you from electronic pickpocket ten years ago i
[01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:11.800]  created a way to protect my own cards from prying eyes after government officials started talking
[01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:17.160]  about issuing a national id card with a built-in radio chip called rfid i felt having to broadcast
[01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:22.360]  my personal information was an invasion of privacy soon after it was also announced that credit cards
[01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:28.840]  debit cards us passports hotel room keys and even transit passes would all soon incorporate rfid it
[01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:32.760]  was then i formed id stronghold to share my inventions and blocking rfid signals with the

[01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:06.120]  bainer is still up there babbling at his announcement he's going to resign at the end of
[01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:10.520]  october and the speakership of the house representatives congressman walter johnson
[01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:16.200]  north carolina that publicly spearheaded the takedown of bainer is going to be joining us
[01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:22.520]  at the start of the next segment marco rubio announced that a conservative function this morning
[01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:30.120]  that bainer was going to be stepping down to applause this is him posing like he's on a rhino
[01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:36.360]  too marco rubio is just as bad as john bainer with his voting record is flip-flopping
[01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:42.440]  his open borders promotion i mean with republicans like this who needs democrats
[01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:50.600]  and this this is why we're in so much trouble and then his worship of the marxist pope and by the
[01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:55.080]  way last night i was listening to local station that was rearing some of my show and i heard myself
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:25:00.520]  calling the pope of a scumbag and stuff i don't apologize the pope for saying that but i need to
[01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:04.920]  be more respectful because there's a lot of good people that are catholics who are very hurt by
[01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:10.920]  what this pope's doing and i don't want to sound gleeful about it i'm actually nauseous i'm upset
[01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:17.160]  um i've never attacked the catholic church or our popes because i thought what they stood for
[01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:22.680]  i really couldn't criticize it's like paunch's pilot i find no fault here when people are pro-life
[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:27.800]  anti-communist you know anti-soviet union and i know there was infiltration and problems and
[01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:34.200]  it i get it there's been a long slide it's just that it really freaks me out to see a pope
[01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:39.000]  with hardcore marxism eugenics you know you can't have air conditioning
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:44.600]  the that's a death sentence to the third world but i'm going to be more professional about it
[01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:50.120]  not because anybody complained everybody loves the fact that i'm bashing him i don't like how it
[01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:59.400]  sounded it's just it's so sick it's so sick uh here is rubio making the announcement on
[01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:05.000]  bainer who's still giving his press conference and we'll see how things progress just a few
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:17.400]  minutes ago speaker bainer announced that he will be resign if people are not there to see rubio
[01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:31.080]  it's a conservative summit standing ovation goes on and on and on let's go back to his lordship uh
[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:36.280]  john bainer uh here for a minute uh to see what his excellence see uh i say that because every
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:41.640]  time they're at the un oh there he is walking out he's leaving let's turn up the audio here as we
[01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:49.720]  watch c-span speaker bainer well i really do uh and he has served our nation to the utmost and i am
[01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:57.400]  very pleased uh that sounds like a staffer calling him very well at at the news conference i'm glad
[01:26:57.400 --> 01:27:02.360]  nobody picked on him or anything nobody picked on him because he cries all the time actually the
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:07.000]  american it's okay he keeps the abortion going because could you cry for a little teddy bear
[01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:12.920]  because if you remember well that's some it's all an act the recent uh
[01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:20.200]  campaigns everything probably still had died him down the road just to scare everybody
[01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:25.720]  if he would do this that he would do that and he embraced that the problem was i can't listen
[01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:32.040]  any more to turn that person off please and some mummy up there doing the interviews i'm sorry i
[01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:37.240]  shouldn't be me and i'm turning into donald trump here sure it's a great reporter i don't know i just
[01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:46.440]  can't handle it there's a headline conservatives warm to his deputy mccarthy we don't need he was
[01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:51.560]  he was the deputy of newt and rich john boner was that's his real name so be proud of your german name
[01:27:51.560 --> 01:28:03.400]  buddy and if your name smith it's not schmitzer or if your name is uh groober it's not gobbler
[01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:12.440]  your name's boner and the point is that now they're trying to put his deputy in
[01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:20.680]  and we're going to have congressman jones joining us again i'm doing i'm plugging twice this hour
[01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:24.600]  as i didn't plug any last hour we got a lot of bills to pay around here and these are high quality

[01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:43.160]  indicted setup and we've had multiple sources that i've put together in the last year from inside
[01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:48.760]  the government uh said that obama has got people he's ordering the fbi uh through the justice department
[01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:55.880]  to find something and they couldn't find anything so they went to the sec the ftc excuse me was the
[01:28:55.880 --> 01:29:00.040]  sec that threatened the filmmaker i knew to not be involved and that came out the new york times
[01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:08.200]  letter mark cuban or film distributor i should say and it doesn't matter we haven't done anything

[01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:18.440]  will confuse you into saying something that's incorrect so they can try to then charge you for
[01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:22.200]  making false statements to the fbi that's why the fbi ever comes around here and they've been here

[01:29:54.200 --> 01:30:02.040]  radio network you've heard of clock kid right the boy who removed the insides of a digital
[01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:05.800]  clock put it in a suitcase then brought it to school to show his teachers when people got
[01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:09.880]  suspicious he claimed he didn't know anything refused to talk to police then gets invited to
[01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:15.480]  the white house we'll get ready now we have pope kid that's right the daily mail reports five-year-old
[01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:19.720]  daughter of illegal immigrants is blessed by pope after breaking through security barricades
[01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:24.600]  hours after he says mass in spanish so fia cruz was part of a crowd of thousands lining the
[01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:28.760]  papal route in washington dc to catch a glimpse of the pontiff as he passed she got over police
[01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:32.440]  barricades and ran out into the street in an attempt to approach the pope mobile she happened
[01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:37.000]  to have a letter and a yellow t-shirt that read pope rescued dappa so the legalization would be
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:40.920]  your blessing makes you wonder with all the security theater around how a five-year-old could
[01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:46.360]  get through hmm maybe it's staged of course every five-year-old's got a letter ready and a t-shirt
[01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:50.680]  printed up nothing weird about that back to the clock kid did you know his sister was suspended
[01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:55.800]  for reportedly threatening to blow up the school hmm now it all becomes clear rob dew reporting

[01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:15.800]  that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years the federal government
[01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:21.400]  mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine accrued form of it be added to table salt because

[01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:42.360]  monday through friday we're here live 11 a.m to 2 p.m central back sundays 4 to 6 p.m we have seen
[01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:49.080]  an unprecedented war on the free press and on whistleblowers even democrat top constitutional
[01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:54.040]  lawyers like jonathan turley have said obama is three times worse than any president they've
[01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:59.880]  ever seen or read about or heard about we have an attack on the family we have an attack on
[01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:04.840]  our sovereignty our borders we have our own government caught funding isis and al-qaeda
[01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:10.200]  even the head of defense intelligence quit and went public a month and a half ago the deputy
[01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:17.080]  head of the cia went public two weeks ago on cbs news so the good news is there are good people in
[01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:23.000]  government telling the truth the bad news is the corrupt elements are doubling and tripling down
[01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:30.200]  now it was back in august and we'll put the article up on screen that we interviewed congressman
[01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:37.160]  walter jones of north carolina we interviewed him on august 15th on the 16th we have the article
[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:44.040]  in the accompanying news bulletin special report fire john bainer vacate the chair speaker blame
[01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:50.840]  for the cause of the power of congress to atrophy thereby making congress subservient to the executive
[01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:57.320]  and judicial branches that's a quote from congressman jones who in part led this dangerous operation
[01:34:57.320 --> 01:35:02.360]  because they target you and come after you when you do this he of course then announced he will
[01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:08.040]  resign at the end of october today and the big question is what precipitated this wasn't the
[01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:13.240]  vacate the chair movement he basically admitted today that internal battles forcing to do this
[01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:19.720]  what comes next who does congressman jones think should be the real conservative patriot
[01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:27.560]  constitutionalist to lead the republican congress and challenge uh president obama bainer said five
[01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:33.960]  times that i saw him in the press congress that just ended 10 minutes ago that he strengthened
[01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:39.080]  the house and strengthened the speakership that of course is obviously not true so joining us is
[01:35:39.080 --> 01:35:44.520]  congressman walter jones congressman thank you so much we've won a big battle but not the war
[01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:49.800]  alex you're exactly right and thank you for having me on your show in mid august to talk
[01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:56.200]  about this issue and no this is an opportunity and i hope and i know you will but i hope other
[01:35:56.200 --> 01:36:03.080]  conservative talk show hosts will pick up the drumsticks and start beating the drum to get a
[01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:08.440]  conservative speaker in the house of representatives we're going to have an opportunity it's not going
[01:36:08.440 --> 01:36:14.920]  to be easy but we're going to have an opportunity to get the right person in that chair and i
[01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:20.680]  anticipate next week when we go back i'm in the liberty caucus as you well know we also have the
[01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:26.920]  freedom caucus if you combine the liberty caucus and the freedom caucus that's about 65 or 70 members
[01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:33.320]  who are basically conservative this will be our opportunity but we need to push from outside
[01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:40.520]  i don't let this just be an inside battle let the outside forces who help us reach this victory
[01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:46.520]  today to let their voices be heard by calling their members of congress and tell them for goodness
[01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:53.480]  sakes let's get a man a principal in the speaker's chair or a woman a principal who will not cut
[01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:59.320]  deals to raise the debt ceiling will not cut deals to spend money overseas that we don't have
[01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:07.080]  well i'm just speechless because you're you're you're focused simple words still
[01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:15.400]  are so important and so crystal that we have a chance to really try to get a good speaker
[01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:21.960]  of the house in there that is basically as powerful as the president if they exercise their power
[01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:26.520]  instead of being lap dogs and we could really turn this country around the entire power structure
[01:37:26.520 --> 01:37:32.840]  both rino and democrat has been focusing its energies on destroying the tea party and stopping a
[01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:40.120]  libertarian conservative rebellion in the house to try to take control of the congress away from
[01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:45.720]  the establishment and we i think are very close to doing that being up there on the hill sir and
[01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:51.560]  being an expert on this what do you think the strategy is the winning strategy to be able to
[01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:59.720]  try to checkmate obama at a time where he's just at operating like a dictator well alex as you know
[01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:07.560]  and i know before we had the vote for the speaker of the house in january of 2015 i was one of 25
[01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:15.000]  to vote no on john bainer you and other talk show hosts you were beating the drum that i called about
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:21.080]  just a moment ago to call for that drumbeat again we're going to have beta will be in office to the
[01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:28.200]  end of october we're going to have a cr coming up and most of us hope that we defund planned
[01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:33.160]  parenthood i don't know what will be in the continuing resolution known as a cr next week but
[01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:38.760]  i would tell you this we are going to have an opportunity that you do not get very often
[01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:45.480]  and that's in the middle of a congressional session to change the leadership that's why again i
[01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:51.160]  wanted to be on your show and i would tell you that i hope that your listeners will do what
[01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:57.960]  they will probably very seldom have an opportunity to do change the direction of the house to
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:05.880]  represent us this is a historic moment right now who should they contact and who are some of the
[01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:11.400]  people you think would be good speakers of the house well alex the reason i'm going to answer
[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:17.400]  you this way is i anticipate over the weekend to have several phone calls which i have not had yet
[01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:24.600]  but i know that there are members of congress who are testing toward us right now who are
[01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:31.000]  conservative i anticipate to be part of telephone conversations this weekend and certainly when i go
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:37.800]  back monday uh and i'm looking at the tv right now and matt saman who's a fine fellow he was from
[01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:45.960]  arizona uh he ended up voting for baner i know that since that time in august he made the statement
[01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:51.240]  back in arizona that if there was a vote to vacate the chair he would vote to vacate the chair
[01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:59.800]  there are plenty of conservatives who know that this is our opportunity to stop the train wreck
[01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:08.040]  the country is being dismantled in front of us right now we need a patriot in the
[01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:15.080]  speakership of the house well alex i i'm i'm looking at right now a washington post article
[01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:18.920]  because i want to write a letter to the editor and let me read the headlines i think this would be
[01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:25.320]  of interest to you and your listeners u.s wasted billions of dollars rebuilding afghanistan
[01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:33.000]  why in the world are we spending so much money wasted money overseas when we've got so many
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:38.840]  needs right here to rebuild america especially in the area of infrastructure that's the kind
[01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:44.600]  of leadership we need someone in that chair that would say to mr obama no we're not going to raise
[01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:50.280]  the debt ceiling this year i'm sorry we raised it seven out of eight times for george bush
[01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:55.720]  mr obama you've been the president for six and a half years you've had seven increases in the
[01:40:55.720 --> 01:41:01.560]  debt ceiling no more all that does is allow us to borrow money from foreign governments and we
[01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:06.840]  can't even pay it back and now the foreign governments aren't borrowing the money the
[01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:14.360]  federal reserve uh does it it's just insane alex that's why this is an opportunity that we don't
[01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:22.120]  get very often and this opportunity is going to be driven by the people in america by calling
[01:41:22.120 --> 01:41:28.920]  their elected officials and say get with the program give us somebody that was stand for principle
[01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:36.120]  to protect america well look at how we've opened the southern border we advertise you can have
[01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:41.480]  your babies here for free they pull off these stunts with anchor babies yesterday with the pub
[01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:49.320]  and now we've have mainstream news saying it's our job to pay for everybody in the world europe's
[01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:54.040]  being told the same thing saudi arabia caused a lot of the problems in syria they won't take
[01:41:54.040 --> 01:42:00.920]  one refugee since when is it the western world's job to pay for everything and why does dc do this
[01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:09.560]  because there's too much influence from as i've said on your show many times money drives policy
[01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:17.240]  policy should be driven by the people of america through the elected officials it is this is an
[01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:24.440]  opportunity that we will not get but every so often and that is why we need to drive this message
[01:42:24.440 --> 01:42:30.360]  across this country sir congressman jones again joins us if you just tuned in walter jones north
[01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:35.640]  carolina banner is announcing he will resign end of october congressman jones with others
[01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:42.520]  uh have spearheaded the vacate the chair movement he admitted if you just joined us in his short
[01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:48.840]  resignation farewell speech that it was because of quote leadership turmoil that was becoming
[01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:55.480]  destructive uh is that not him signaling that the longer he stayed in the more libertarian
[01:42:55.480 --> 01:43:01.480]  constitutional members of the house uh the more strength they got to get a good person in there
[01:43:01.480 --> 01:43:09.320]  yeah absolutely i i know and and you know that the pressure that the meadows resolution
[01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:14.120]  put on the speaker the house and there were more and more republicans going home listening
[01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:19.320]  to people like you alex that came back and said you know if vena still goes down this
[01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:25.880]  road we're going to have to vacate the chair i want to thank mark meadows for taking the lead
[01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:32.440]  i joined him thomas mass he joined him from kentucky ted yoho joined him and last week
[01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:38.680]  louis goma added his name to the resolution well i said this last time you were on after you left
[01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:44.280]  that um because of your leadership i think you are a target because of louis gomert's
[01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:49.240]  leadership he's undoubtedly a target uh this administration is going after i know from high
[01:43:49.240 --> 01:43:54.040]  level sources the governor of texas has the feds investigating the guys as clean as a whistle
[01:43:54.040 --> 01:43:59.400]  uh they've indicted the attorney general who was fighting obama and it's happening in other
[01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:03.480]  states they're taking the gloves off this is a criminal group i know you're a gentleman and
[01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:08.520]  you know don't like to use terms like that but the 28 pages you've seen it senator graham seen it
[01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:14.600]  uh the soddies were involved quarterbacking 9 11 there was a stand down now we have general
[01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:21.800]  flinn the outgoing head of defense intelligence agency on television five weeks ago saying they
[01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:28.040]  were ordered to aid al qaeda in isis and that it was very evil we have the deputy head of the cia
[01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:34.680]  saying on cbs news faced the nation two weeks ago that signifies to me that the government the good
[01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:41.320]  people in government whether it be the fbi or the cia or defense intelligence or uh you name it
[01:44:41.320 --> 01:44:46.040]  are ready to stand up and tell the truth in fact they're doing stuff that i think endangers their
[01:44:46.040 --> 01:44:51.320]  lives i know that um turnall shaper has been seriously threatened for coming on the show about
[01:44:51.320 --> 01:44:56.440]  mangosi and breaking the stinger missiles here first um so so the point is there's not just
[01:44:56.440 --> 01:45:00.920]  bad guys out there there are a lot of good guys as well and the battle is heating up right now
[01:45:01.720 --> 01:45:06.840]  how does this tie into the 28 pages i mean what do you make of high level generals resigning and
[01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:12.440]  saying i'm not going to work with al qaeda and isis i mean this is sensational news it makes it in a
[01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:20.600]  few papers but then doesn't go anywhere alex that's why my hope is it's just like the 28 pages that
[01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:24.440]  you very kindly have had me on your show and you know there have been other members
[01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:30.520]  steve lynch democrat thomas master republican have joined me in a resolution calling on the white
[01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:38.280]  house to declassify that information i don't want to read too much into mr bainer stepping down but
[01:45:38.280 --> 01:45:44.040]  i'm telling you because of my frustration for a number of years the right person in the speaker's
[01:45:44.040 --> 01:45:52.600]  chair can become a spokesman a spokesman for what is good and what is right and what is wrong and
[01:45:52.600 --> 01:46:00.200]  what needs to be changed from wrong to right like obama care like third trimester abortion
[01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:05.400]  partial birth all of this is incredibly unpopular it's unconstitutional it could be overturned but
[01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:14.520]  bainer would never stand up no no that that's that's the whole point like i said john is a good person
[01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:20.200]  but he is not a leader he is a leader that would rather instead of standing for principle he rather
[01:46:20.200 --> 01:46:25.080]  give in on principle i know you're a gentleman and a nice guy he comes off as a great guy to play
[01:46:25.080 --> 01:46:30.040]  golf with but uh how does he treat you in person when he runs into you knowing for years you've
[01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:34.760]  been trying to get rid of him he'll just just say hello and that's fine i don't need to have a
[01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:40.280]  conversation with him it's simply because i know what's happening to this country i'm willing to be
[01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:46.440]  on your show and other shows to speak about the fact that our debt is 18.3 trillion when bill
[01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:53.080]  clinton was in office and left off alex in 2000 we were 5.6 trillion dollars in debt we tripled the
[01:46:53.080 --> 01:46:59.960]  debt in 15 years we cannot continue to go this way and no foundation we are a nation on weak legs
[01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:05.320]  right now when it goes under most economists say will be like mexico or nick or you know some of
[01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:10.440]  the third world country i mean people don't seem to get it's untenable and the ruling
[01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:15.800]  establishment is multinational they don't care if america goes under but what is going to happen
[01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:20.760]  if we fall into a third world country i mean the whole world is going to be affected by that well
[01:47:20.760 --> 01:47:26.040]  alex i do the shopping in my family i've been married 49 years to the same lady and i do the
[01:47:26.040 --> 01:47:32.040]  shopping and i can tell you everything that i buy the boxes are smaller the ingredients are smaller
[01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:39.000]  amount in the in the box and it the price goes up i mean we are at a time that america's at a
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:43.080]  crossroads and either we're going to survive or we're not going to survive and i think this is
[01:47:43.080 --> 01:47:49.880]  one step to survive and by getting the right person in the speaker's chair absolutely well
[01:47:49.880 --> 01:47:54.600]  you're always thanking me sir please don't thank me this is all about saving our republic i know you
[01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:59.640]  don't want thanks as well but it's so refreshing to have a statesman like yourself and in the last
[01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:04.040]  few minutes we have left here i wanted to just ask you because i know you have to fight against a
[01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:08.920]  lot of the money they send against you at both parties and the rest of it what is your prognosis
[01:48:08.920 --> 01:48:16.280]  for more patriot constitutionalist common sense tea party type republicans taking over the republican
[01:48:16.280 --> 01:48:25.640]  party uh and saving this country well on the house side i'm very hopeful that this uh resident
[01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:33.960]  residing by mr bainer will inspire other conservative libertarian types to run for office
[01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:39.560]  and not become part of the problem in washington but like a few of us are trying to be is the
[01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:47.400]  solution to the problem in washington that's why again alex you and the many of us can make the
[01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:53.720]  call to the american people to help us elect the right person to be in the speaker's chair
[01:48:56.840 --> 01:49:03.720]  absolutely i know you don't like to speak yellow people but who would not be a good choice what
[01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:13.240]  about what about speaker bainer's right hand man they're talking about trying to get mccarthy
[01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:17.800]  in there what's your view on that i don't think i don't think anyone from the leadership team
[01:49:17.800 --> 01:49:24.520]  is the right person and mccarthy's part of that uh scolese is part of that and keffie
[01:49:24.520 --> 01:49:29.560]  rogers mcmaris and they're good people i like miss people but i know that they don't have
[01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:34.200]  the backbone that we need in that speaker's chair to change the direction of the house and
[01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:41.160]  to change the direction of this country very well said uh thank you so much congressman
[01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:45.480]  jones the minute and a half we have left what else is on your radar that you want to tell folks
[01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:51.480]  about well i would just like to tell people that and i know i've been repetitive but i like to say
[01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:57.000]  that we're not going to get many opportunities like we have now we have a few days for the people
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:03.720]  to rally behind congress to put the right person in that speaker's chair let's get us a conservative
[01:50:03.720 --> 01:50:08.760]  who believes in the constitution who believes in the bible who believes in the greatness of america
[01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:15.240]  and stop all this waste wasteful spending overseas i just read the title of the washington post

[01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:43.320]  you can look it up the new york times i went on record i said uh the security change commission
[01:54:43.320 --> 01:54:47.800]  called up on the phone threatened to put him in prison for insider trading for stuff that was
[01:54:47.800 --> 01:54:54.520]  completely legal uh if he put out loose change final cut that i produced on a thousand plus screens
[01:54:56.040 --> 01:55:03.400]  and i told that story on air but just said it was a hollywood producer of the film wouldn't say who
[01:55:03.400 --> 01:55:06.760]  because they'd asked us not to say and then it came out in the new york times a year later
[01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:13.320]  and in the video on info wars dot com source white house has fbi task force investigating
[01:55:13.320 --> 01:55:18.200]  info wars we have the video where i show the new york times article so you've seen him go out to
[01:55:18.200 --> 01:55:24.040]  dinesh to suze everybody they didn't just call him up they sent him an email that he used to kill
[01:55:24.040 --> 01:55:31.240]  their court case so they indicted him again and he beat them again 96 of the time you don't beat
[01:55:31.240 --> 01:55:37.720]  them because they'll frame you but they went so far as to say we're going to get you that that's
[01:55:37.720 --> 01:55:41.720]  how he stopped them the guy was worth like you know four billion that he's worth like five six
[01:55:41.720 --> 01:55:48.360]  billion now you know smart businessman from nothing he was able to beat them because they
[01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:54.040]  were so arrogant i mean that's how corrupt this country is you really think 96 of people
[01:55:54.040 --> 01:55:56.520]  the feds in doubt are really guilty you mean you really believe that
[01:55:56.520 --> 01:56:02.760]  that no about half of them are completely innocent his major studies a third of people
[01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:10.600]  on death row didn't do it dna testing now shows i remember the up in uh round rock the prosecutor
[01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:15.320]  in williamson county knew he was sending michael mortensen to prison and knew he was innocent
[01:56:16.760 --> 01:56:23.160]  the guy had no criminal record his wife had been killed why would you i don't know why they do it
[01:56:23.160 --> 01:56:30.040]  they just get off on putting good people in prison i couldn't think of a more demonic thing to do
[01:56:30.040 --> 01:56:35.640]  other than like sacrifice children or something and i know the government's departmentalized
[01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:38.920]  there's a lot of people in government that aren't corrupt but they're like in different divisions
[01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:45.720]  so i only raised that show we are big time they know we're big time they've tried to
[01:56:45.720 --> 01:56:51.480]  assassinate my name everything they failed so they're moving the ballgame and i mean to the
[01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:57.400]  fbis credit they were ordered by the white house according to multiple sources two years ago to dig
[01:56:57.400 --> 01:57:05.400]  up something and they couldn't so then it went to the ftc and back to the fbi and i'm two years into
[01:57:05.400 --> 01:57:14.040]  this and i just will they follow orders i don't know they've got a group out of dc reportedly
[01:57:14.040 --> 01:57:21.560]  follow whatever order they're given so whatever i'm not afraid and it'd be like saying are you afraid
[01:57:21.560 --> 01:57:25.720]  some kidnappers are going to come i mean they're kidnappers they're bad people i mean i'm not going
[01:57:25.720 --> 01:57:34.360]  to live in fear of it i know this is and this is on records i'm not scared of a swat team right
[01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:37.960]  or something like that even though that's what they're talking about doing just for the added media effect
[01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:44.360]  um we're not going to resist any of it we're going to sit there and just
[01:57:46.120 --> 01:57:51.000]  be the martyrs we are politically and the whole thing will come out and that's their only hope
[01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:56.120]  i'm sure from experts i've talked to and i concur is to get us to do something stupid and we're not
[01:57:56.120 --> 01:58:03.720]  going to do that and the plan is i can beat the rap whatever it's going to be i can't beat the ride
[01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:09.880]  to slow us down to whatever we're not a small organization we're very strong we reach a lot
[01:58:09.880 --> 01:58:14.840]  of people we have great supporters and out of this we're going to get bigger and raise more
[01:58:14.840 --> 01:58:20.680]  capital and be stronger and we even have studios and things set up in other countries everything
[01:58:20.680 --> 01:58:28.040]  ready for this i mean we think we're stupid this is the central texas command center and we've always

[02:09:08.760 --> 02:09:16.040]  gentlemen over and over again and now they'd say good kid good job you spied on them without a warrant
[02:09:16.040 --> 02:09:22.200]  good job you dialed in to what was happening this is the total overthrow of the americana system of
[02:09:22.200 --> 02:09:29.160]  what made us so special and now they sit here with the dea the fbi and all the rest of them
[02:09:29.160 --> 02:09:35.480]  creating fake investigations where they frame people and then they go and parallel construct
[02:09:35.480 --> 02:09:41.800]  where they claim they got all the evidence and go officially lie in front of the federal judges
[02:09:42.760 --> 02:09:48.360]  and the federal judges know full well they're doing it look up parallel construction for yourself
[02:09:48.360 --> 02:09:55.080]  and they even have classes at the justice department for the fbi and others to learn how to lie
[02:09:55.880 --> 02:10:00.280]  but you got to become a supervisor to get into those classes then you get the bigger paycheck
[02:10:01.320 --> 02:10:08.360]  and so this is the criminal government that we have and of course the dea is out in afghanistan
[02:10:08.920 --> 02:10:14.280]  torturing people to death that don't agree to only sell their opium to the united states
[02:10:14.280 --> 02:10:21.880]  this is how the globalists operate in fact they pulled up the roiders article but the
[02:10:21.880 --> 02:10:25.960]  mainstream media will always say oh that's info wars so we save a few paragraphs to document it
[02:10:25.960 --> 02:10:32.040]  click on the roiders link itself and we'll take you to us drug enforcement agency halts huge secret
[02:10:32.040 --> 02:10:39.560]  data program with the nsa where they parallel construct fake investigations how could anyone
[02:10:39.560 --> 02:10:44.280]  ever sit in on one of these federal juries and believe anything you're being told
[02:10:47.400 --> 02:10:53.640]  because this is not the federal government this is an alien foreign banking cartel that began
[02:10:53.640 --> 02:11:01.320]  to take over the country the face sucker got on us in 1913 laid eggs in us dc blew open
[02:11:01.320 --> 02:11:07.480]  a bunch of aliens came out and now they've got the whole country in the whole world infested
[02:11:10.120 --> 02:11:14.680]  america was a big strong host and millions of eggs popped out of us
[02:11:19.160 --> 02:11:25.160]  that's the allegory and now we got our guts hanging out stumbling around half dead
[02:11:26.040 --> 02:11:29.960]  and the tea party's like you might want to show your intestines shut you might live
[02:11:29.960 --> 02:11:33.960]  and the media's going shut up all that red stuff spring out of your belly's loving
[02:11:33.960 --> 02:11:40.200]  just just lay down and relax they just want us to die they're done with us they already sucked
[02:11:40.200 --> 02:11:45.240]  us dry we already hatched world government we already funded total takeover we have the highest
[02:11:45.240 --> 02:11:50.760]  rates of cancer diabetes neurological disorders they're chem trailing us poisoning the water
[02:11:50.760 --> 02:11:56.760]  dumbing us down just slaughtering everyone you got all these departmentalized idiots work for
[02:11:56.760 --> 02:12:01.880]  the government they think they're part of the winning team their kids drink fluoride they breathe
[02:12:01.880 --> 02:12:06.680]  the chem trails they take all the shots probably a third of the feds listening to the show got a
[02:12:06.680 --> 02:12:12.520]  kid can't even talk that's your bosses is what they did to you you're not part of the winning team
[02:12:12.520 --> 02:12:19.720]  you're getting screwed over like everybody else and see they know my straight texas talk my hardcore
[02:12:19.720 --> 02:12:27.640]  in your face paradigm shattering info cuts through the trance for whatever grating reason
[02:12:27.640 --> 02:12:30.680]  and gets people thinking because i cover stuff so horrible
[02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:38.440]  see the globalists do things so bad that people can't even imagine it's going on the believability
[02:12:38.440 --> 02:12:43.640]  is not there but then i show you historical examples and show you what's currently happening and so
[02:12:43.640 --> 02:12:50.520]  people get the believability they research for themselves i've had listeners for 21 years and
[02:12:50.520 --> 02:12:55.080]  people heard me talk about Planned Parenthood and baby parts and hospitals killing people for their
[02:12:55.080 --> 02:12:59.000]  organs that's now in the news what do you think happened to our credibility we have the congressman
[02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:03.400]  on to get rid of baner now he's going what do you think happens to our credibility we expose
[02:13:03.400 --> 02:13:09.400]  Benghazi first what happens to credibility fast and furious homeland security dhs myac memos first
[02:13:09.400 --> 02:13:14.440]  first first first first first first the illegals being shipped in by border patrol given vouchers
[02:13:14.440 --> 02:13:20.200]  jikari jackson adan salazar first first first first we're first we're first we're first we're
[02:13:20.200 --> 02:13:25.080]  first we're first we're first we're first we're first we're first or we take what's currently
[02:13:25.080 --> 02:13:31.160]  going on and decipher it and then what our analysis ends up to be right 99 percent of the time
[02:13:33.480 --> 02:13:37.240]  it's it's constant it's not hard once you shift your paradigm they say it's
[02:13:37.240 --> 02:13:40.520]  10 000 illegals are going to bring in out of the middle east i say it's going to be a couple
[02:13:40.520 --> 02:13:47.480]  hundred thousand by next week it was i've got their formula i've got them down i've got the jack on them
[02:13:48.840 --> 02:13:53.400]  i'm not bragging because the more i get right this is the most important thing i've said in a year
[02:13:53.400 --> 02:14:01.640]  listen to me carefully i subconsciously have sold out at some level because i catch myself not being
[02:14:01.640 --> 02:14:06.680]  as hardcore i catch myself not saying stuff because it's so horrible even though i know it's true
[02:14:06.680 --> 02:14:10.600]  because i don't want to be rude i don't want to be hateful i don't want to be incendiary
[02:14:10.600 --> 02:14:16.440]  i have children i in my flesh i want to protect them in my flesh i don't want to confront these
[02:14:16.440 --> 02:14:23.640]  demons but you know my spirit's stronger than my flesh spirits willing the flesh is weak well
[02:14:23.640 --> 02:14:29.160]  that's a two-way street and my kids don't have a future anyways if we don't beat this so i've
[02:14:29.160 --> 02:14:35.400]  just got to decide to do the right thing may the heavens fall and you got to decide that
[02:14:35.400 --> 02:14:40.280]  because i know what we're facing i know how serious it is who's up first chicara night

[02:17:14.760 --> 02:17:20.760]  blows up even bigger and that's because i'm not selling out i'm going all the way i'm telling it
[02:17:20.760 --> 02:17:27.960]  like it is i'm becoming conscious of the fact of my own weakness and i'm refusing to be weak
[02:17:27.960 --> 02:17:34.040]  in the face of their weakness i refuse to crawl around on my belly like they do let's go to david

[02:17:49.720 --> 02:17:55.800]  the 9-11 museum the pope spoke here earlier actually it was a world religion ceremony but
[02:17:55.800 --> 02:18:00.200]  before we talk about that alex i want to talk about what happened at the un this morning at the
[02:18:00.200 --> 02:18:05.320]  un is part of his speech one of the things that he said was that the environment has rights that's
[02:18:05.320 --> 02:18:09.400]  a quote the environment has rights and he's going to speak for him that's the classic takeoff that's
[02:18:09.400 --> 02:18:15.960]  right that's right and so what he's selling there is essentially gaya religion gaya theory that we've
[02:18:15.960 --> 02:18:20.920]  seen many people push for the earth firsters that that that agenda many people look at this
[02:18:20.920 --> 02:18:25.640]  whether they're catholic or i've gotten a lot of tweet backs from people saying well i agree with
[02:18:25.640 --> 02:18:29.640]  a pope and i'm not a catholic i'm an atheist i think what he's doing is great those people
[02:18:29.640 --> 02:18:35.880]  need to understand that this is not a moral case it's being made this is a political takeover and
[02:18:35.880 --> 02:18:41.720]  this evidence of that alex the chinese president met with obama right after the pope left in
[02:18:41.720 --> 02:18:47.720]  washington yesterday today they're releasing an agenda that the us and china have agreed on cap
[02:18:47.720 --> 02:18:53.560]  and trade this is all falling into place that's the next step just like the tpp and you can see
[02:18:53.560 --> 02:19:00.040]  the parallel structure with the tpp as well the united states in the center enacting a trans pacific
[02:19:00.040 --> 02:19:05.800]  agreement enacting a transatlantic agreement at the same time we are the spine on which they
[02:19:05.800 --> 02:19:10.440]  attach these two wings bringing these things together in the next step towards global governance
[02:19:10.440 --> 02:19:16.840]  but they're also doing it with the climate change agenda the cap and trade agenda because what they're
[02:19:16.840 --> 02:19:22.200]  going to do is they're going to cap and tax you they're going to control your energy uses and
[02:19:22.200 --> 02:19:27.960]  you can see in this particular instance we've got the chinese president the u.s president and
[02:19:27.960 --> 02:19:32.600]  essentially the cultural leader of europe there's not a strong central leader in europe they could
[02:19:32.600 --> 02:19:38.120]  speak of all for all of europe so they bring in the pope and with the added advantage alex that
[02:19:38.120 --> 02:19:42.920]  he can make a moral case that's right he's sort of cemented all together they're making their

[02:24:34.200 --> 02:24:38.280]  you know i've told you about backup plans if they try to come after me i've kept you out of the whole
[02:24:38.280 --> 02:24:44.200]  business end of things for you and paul watson to fill my shoes if they kill me or if they set me up
[02:24:44.200 --> 02:24:50.200]  long before this i knew stuff was going on uh but i'm sure you may have read this morning and and
[02:24:50.200 --> 02:24:56.120]  perhaps seen a video uh we're sourced white house has fbi task force investigating info wars i mean
[02:24:56.120 --> 02:25:01.720]  they've got all these white house run media outlets saying it's time to arrest me and stuff uh so
[02:25:03.080 --> 02:25:06.920]  this just and it's not just i'm just a canary in the coal mine they're going after people
[02:25:06.920 --> 02:25:13.400]  across the board which shows we have power which shows we're having an effect which shows they
[02:25:13.400 --> 02:25:18.280]  need to not have any opposition to execute what they're about to do it's a very reckless move
[02:25:18.280 --> 02:25:21.640]  it's not like there hasn't been corruption in government before in this country but it was
[02:25:21.640 --> 02:25:29.240]  smart enough to not go after vocal opposition in the middle of the sun sunny day um this is
[02:25:29.240 --> 02:25:35.000]  really getting to crazy town your take day but night well alex that's very true as i was listening
[02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:40.280]  to the press conference where john bain resigned and again that's something that we've been pushing
[02:25:40.280 --> 02:25:44.680]  really hard for he tried to put a brave face on it one of the reporters said uh if you don't have
[02:25:44.680 --> 02:25:50.360]  anybody following you you're not a leader you're just somebody taking a walk and and that's the key
[02:25:50.360 --> 02:25:54.120]  that's what we have to understand when i look at all the people following the government has a
[02:25:54.120 --> 02:25:59.800]  nine percent approval rating we have a high exactly it's illegitimate go ahead sorry well when i
[02:25:59.800 --> 02:26:05.640]  look at all these people following the pope uh to me the big story is not the prepared speeches
[02:26:05.640 --> 02:26:09.800]  that the pope is making yes it's important that he's selling nonsense that the environment has
[02:26:09.800 --> 02:26:14.360]  rights it would be laughable if we knew if we didn't know that that was going to be taken
[02:26:14.360 --> 02:26:19.960]  literally and used against us but the thing that gives him power are the people that follow him
[02:26:19.960 --> 02:26:25.800]  not knowing what the agenda is about and so that's our task alex is to tell people what's behind this
[02:26:25.800 --> 02:26:30.920]  to give them a broader perspective if you want to understand what this is about in the immediate
[02:26:30.920 --> 02:26:37.160]  future it's about climate change that's the next governance and you can see that by the
[02:26:37.160 --> 02:26:43.480]  chinese president coming with obama and the pope at the same time going to the un going to congress
[02:26:43.480 --> 02:26:48.920]  trying to push this through they could not get it done last time because uh the gop was able to
[02:26:48.920 --> 02:26:55.400]  push back and say look you can't put restrictions on us that china is not going to take it's not
[02:26:55.400 --> 02:27:00.360]  going to you don't talk to me about global warming about a global climate issue if you're only going
[02:27:00.360 --> 02:27:05.640]  to put this selectively on the developed nation so they learned their lesson they bided their time
[02:27:05.640 --> 02:27:09.480]  they're back they've got the big third world leader the pope is the leader of the third world
[02:27:09.480 --> 02:27:14.600]  he that mainly catholic third world they've now got him there to sucker them in to the eugenics
[02:27:14.600 --> 02:27:20.120]  extermination uh austerity movement which will kill a billion people or monk's numbers show it
[02:27:20.120 --> 02:27:24.440]  that's why i get so angry at him he knows full well this is an exterminist agenda
[02:27:24.440 --> 02:27:29.640]  exactly let me read you what mother jones said because they're not catholic they're not looking
[02:27:29.640 --> 02:27:34.680]  at this with the starry eyes of someone who's who's projecting onto the pope what they would
[02:27:34.680 --> 02:27:39.080]  like it to be they said something big and strange is happening in the us this week obama the pope
[02:27:39.080 --> 02:27:44.840]  and the president of china are teaming up to save the world no they're teaming up to rule the world
[02:27:44.840 --> 02:27:49.320]  that's precisely what this is about and they're doing it for the people behind the scenes that's
[02:27:49.320 --> 02:27:53.560]  the agenda that you need to understand is being sold as being compassionate is being sold and we've
[02:27:53.560 --> 02:28:01.000]  got the ford foundation a fake liberal publication lauding a foreign communist leader the pope and
[02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:09.800]  the president combining forces to save us when we know it's all about tyranny yes and of course all
[02:28:09.800 --> 02:28:15.800]  of them are on the same page when it comes to a redistribution of wealth all the money in the
[02:28:15.800 --> 02:28:20.840]  hands of a few people the chinese government it was communist when it suited them now they're a
[02:28:20.840 --> 02:28:25.480]  group of fascists and that's really what this is there's not really any difference when you get down
[02:28:25.480 --> 02:28:31.000]  to it at the end the end game there's no difference between fascism and communism it's a small elite
[02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:35.160]  cabal that is running everything and they can just use whatever label they want people have to get
[02:28:35.160 --> 02:28:40.040]  beyond labels they have to get beyond personality that's what concerns me so much alex about the
[02:28:40.040 --> 02:28:46.040]  g.o.p election when i see everybody falling in love with personality or on the democrat side as
[02:28:46.040 --> 02:28:51.800]  we saw with obama eight years ago we need to look at the agenda of these people we need to vet them
[02:28:51.800 --> 02:28:57.160]  carefully and we need to stop putting all of our hopes on some distant high ruler that is going to
[02:28:57.160 --> 02:29:02.600]  save us in in this life and we need to work at the local level now today he was at the 9-11
[02:29:02.600 --> 02:29:09.000]  memorial museum here they had a multi-religion service that's now over but alex as we were
[02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:15.720]  watching that he was saying and all these different religious leaders were saying every life is
[02:29:15.720 --> 02:29:23.080]  valuable and all religions take all these lives as well the key is they get to speak they get to
[02:29:23.080 --> 02:29:28.280]  speak for the environment and the quote all religions working together in freedom and then
[02:29:28.280 --> 02:29:32.360]  they let radical islam run wild but then arrest christians for free speech stay there david i want
[02:29:32.360 --> 02:29:36.360]  you to finish up then we're going to go to jacari jackson and get his tag he's been following amazing

[02:29:50.120 --> 02:30:01.000]  on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network over the weekend charol akinson released the
[02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:06.200]  following article what the news isn't saying about vaccine autism studies she starts off with the new
[02:30:06.200 --> 02:30:10.760]  england journal of medicine study that says there is no link between vaccines and autism she then
[02:30:10.760 --> 02:30:15.320]  discloses the consulting firm behind the study the luan group lists major vaccine makers among its
[02:30:15.320 --> 02:30:19.560]  clients in fact the luan group's parent company united health group is a key government partner
[02:30:19.560 --> 02:30:24.360]  in obama care and a subsidiary of united health group qssi was given the contract to build the
[02:30:24.360 --> 02:30:29.240]  obama care website she then looks at the astroturf propaganda campaign and some of the buzzwords they
[02:30:29.240 --> 02:30:34.840]  use like weak too small haphazard not replicated junk science flawed unrelated and how these words
[02:30:34.840 --> 02:30:40.040]  are used over and over again to attack anybody who questions the vaccine mafia she then covers over
[02:30:40.040 --> 02:30:45.000]  13 different studies that show a correlation between vaccine intake and brain damage in fact
[02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:49.480]  permanent brain damage isn't acknowledged rare side effective vaccines and there's no dispute

[02:33:39.320 --> 02:33:46.200]  japan to mexico from the netherlands to chile or demanding their employees take chips be able to
[02:33:46.200 --> 02:33:52.200]  enter the building cash is to be banned world i d cards are being promoted
[02:33:55.320 --> 02:34:00.280]  david knight is our reporter on the ground outside the world trade center they're outside the
[02:34:00.280 --> 02:34:04.440]  u n earlier today jacari jackson's going to give us his take on a bunch of issues in a moment but
[02:34:04.440 --> 02:34:11.320]  david knight you were getting into this epic moment where they pushed the entire eugenics transhumanist
[02:34:11.320 --> 02:34:16.360]  animal rights movement that isn't about animal rights but about government taking human liberty
[02:34:16.360 --> 02:34:23.000]  away in the name of animals the end of private property i mean this is all happening with this
[02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:30.280]  fabulously rich pope uh and obama and the chinese president lecturing everyone on austerity as they
[02:34:30.280 --> 02:34:35.160]  get ready to screw the people in the past governments try to create prosperity to be popular now they
[02:34:35.160 --> 02:34:41.400]  shell us on how ugly we are and how great it is to be poor this is truly a 1984 society a world of
[02:34:41.400 --> 02:34:47.160]  being trampled and being trampled upon and trampling exactly alex they're telling you that
[02:34:47.160 --> 02:34:52.440]  they're going to stand for the environment that the environment has rights that animals have rights
[02:34:52.440 --> 02:34:57.640]  this is the path to tyranny they're going to be the ones who tell you how to protect the environment
[02:34:57.640 --> 02:35:02.920]  how to protect the rights it's just a beard and of course today what we saw was uh essentially a
[02:35:02.920 --> 02:35:06.920]  world religion ceremony look i know a lot of people look at this they say isn't it great
[02:35:06.920 --> 02:35:11.640]  that all these different religions could come together and agree that 9-11 was a bad thing
[02:35:11.640 --> 02:35:18.440]  and i say yes it is but that's not the way you get religious tolerances by a really by having a
[02:35:18.440 --> 02:35:23.960]  wonderful world religion that says that we all worship the same god that is if you believe that
[02:35:23.960 --> 02:35:28.920]  you're a fool if you tell people that you're a deceiver the way to have tolerance of people
[02:35:28.920 --> 02:35:33.240]  is by something called the first amendment we solved that problem here in america once upon
[02:35:33.240 --> 02:35:38.600]  a time we're about to undo that again because if you have a one world religion there will be no
[02:35:38.600 --> 02:35:43.320]  tolerance for your religion if we already see christians being targeted under this liberal
[02:35:43.320 --> 02:35:48.600]  one world religion garbage yes the only religion being targeted is true christianity and and let
[02:35:48.600 --> 02:35:53.640]  me tell you you know that the pope is very concerned about the muslims who who died as part of the
[02:35:53.640 --> 02:36:00.520]  hajj you know and in uh in uh south of the arabia and there were over 700 people who died in a stampede
[02:36:00.520 --> 02:36:07.320]  that has that's the seventh incident according to my count since 1990 over 3000 people have died
[02:36:07.320 --> 02:36:11.880]  doing that so it's happening over and over and over again yet the pope will not criticize islam
[02:36:11.880 --> 02:36:17.640]  for that do you think if there were 3000 people shot in new york city by by gunmen you think you'd
[02:36:17.640 --> 02:36:22.760]  have something to say about that he'd blame the gun he'd blame the gun culture he's not blaming
[02:36:22.760 --> 02:36:29.000]  islam or the muslim culture for this repeated stampeding and death it's it's just what we're
[02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:32.840]  seeing here today with the with the one world religion and i kind of say what is behind the
[02:36:32.840 --> 02:36:37.880]  stampeding i mean isn't it just mecca's letting too many people in the saudis are letting
[02:36:37.880 --> 02:36:45.000]  two people into that sided medina they have a ceremony the stoning of uh satan and it gets
[02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:51.400]  them worked up into a fury and uh they have uh people get stampeded because they start running
[02:36:51.400 --> 02:36:56.520]  over each other it's a massive crowd and they're just the lack of control but i want to say this
[02:36:56.520 --> 02:37:01.560]  in terms of the preciousness of each life because we heard that from all the different leaders of
[02:37:01.560 --> 02:37:06.920]  all these different religions today if they really believe that they would be standing at an abortion
[02:37:06.920 --> 02:37:11.880]  clinic because there are more children that are killed each day with an abortion than there were
[02:37:11.880 --> 02:37:17.720]  who people who died here on 9 11 we have a 9 11 every day at abortion clinics but this pope
[02:37:17.720 --> 02:37:22.440]  can't be bothered to say that when i was standing uh taking pictures we got the mordecai coming in
[02:37:22.440 --> 02:37:28.200]  earlier this morning at the un i heard people talking around me and one of them said this guy
[02:37:28.200 --> 02:37:33.720]  is great every time this pope talks he makes people understand the plight of those who have
[02:37:33.720 --> 02:37:40.680]  less than them and he did a great job by not feeding the right wing pro lifers you understand that
[02:37:41.560 --> 02:37:46.120]  feel sorry for people because they don't have as much money as you do but don't feel sorry for them
[02:37:46.120 --> 02:37:51.400]  because they're having their life taken that's the kind of calculus well it's their religion
[02:37:51.400 --> 02:37:55.800]  it's their religion this is what they're pushing yes and he's spouting classical
[02:37:56.600 --> 02:38:02.520]  marxism and and then now all these leftists just love the pope see they love a religion that pushes
[02:38:02.520 --> 02:38:08.200]  their idea because they're inner religion of collectivism that ends free will and ends language
[02:38:08.200 --> 02:38:15.720]  and makes you adopt their orthodox view of the world yes absolutely he had one other thing too
[02:38:15.720 --> 02:38:20.280]  i want to tell you alex and that was when he met privately with the clergy i believe it was a
[02:38:20.280 --> 02:38:25.240]  a private meeting in washington that this quote came out of but he was talking to the church leaders
[02:38:25.240 --> 02:38:30.440]  that were there and this is what he had to say to them he said uh many of you have suffered greatly
[02:38:30.440 --> 02:38:35.400]  and the not too distant past by having to bear the shame of some of your brothers who harmed and
[02:38:35.400 --> 02:38:41.720]  scandalized the church in the most vulnerable of her members do you catch that the only thing he
[02:38:41.720 --> 02:38:46.600]  really had to say about the pedophile controversy within the roman catholic church was i'm sorry
[02:38:46.600 --> 02:38:52.120]  that some of you were embarrassed by being connected with that he doesn't talk about the
[02:38:52.120 --> 02:38:56.920]  heinousness of this and alex when i look at the way he didn't personalize it he just said i'm sorry
[02:38:56.920 --> 02:39:03.000]  it it it it embarrassed our thing yes it embarrassed our institution i'm sorry because
[02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:06.920]  you're part of the institution but just like we see with the police they don't purge the evil
[02:39:06.920 --> 02:39:13.160]  doers out of their midst that is how you embrace corruption that's how you propagate corruption
[02:39:13.160 --> 02:39:17.080]  and i thought it was absolutely outrageous that that's the only thing that we've seen of that
[02:39:17.080 --> 02:39:21.720]  if you want to talk about how you are there to help the children then do something to help the
[02:39:21.720 --> 02:39:26.520]  children stop people from killing them and selling their baby parts and stop people from molesting
[02:39:26.520 --> 02:39:31.000]  them sexually then we can have a conversation about what else you want to do to protect the
[02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:36.040]  children but people need to understand the thousands tens of thousands of people whatever
[02:39:36.040 --> 02:39:42.280]  that are here they need to understand that this moral high ground that he has is simply a mask
[02:39:42.280 --> 02:39:47.560]  a facade for a globalist agenda so they can rule the world and you can see that with the
[02:39:47.560 --> 02:39:53.000]  confluence of the pope and the chinese president and obama coming together on this next step of
[02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:57.560]  global governance it's it's it's a pope joins forces with obama and communist china to take
[02:39:57.560 --> 02:40:06.440]  over the world this is a true axis of eugenics a true axis of destroying any type of industrialization
[02:40:06.440 --> 02:40:11.720]  clean industrialization around the world thank you so much uh david thank you elix i don't want to
[02:40:11.720 --> 02:40:16.520]  say i want to say too that uh no matter what happens i'm not going anywhere jacar is not
[02:40:16.520 --> 02:40:20.680]  going anywhere we're standing with you elix well i know our audience is as well and you know
[02:40:21.240 --> 02:40:25.960]  this is from real sources but they could also be telling these people this just to jerk our chain
[02:40:25.960 --> 02:40:30.040]  and knowing we'll say it so it'll scare the audience but that's because they think we're cowards
[02:40:30.680 --> 02:40:35.880]  we're not uh and we always just disclose what's going on and we get all these secret documents
[02:40:35.880 --> 02:40:39.640]  we get all these great sources and we get all these whistleblowers because we're crazy enough
[02:40:39.640 --> 02:40:44.280]  to put it out and i've been through a lot of persecution before this it's been kind of quiet
[02:40:44.280 --> 02:40:49.080]  the last few years and i know i go out for the winehouse all the time and i point out what a
[02:40:49.080 --> 02:40:53.800]  fraud they are and what liars they are and uh you know and i have walter jones all these folks on
[02:40:53.800 --> 02:40:59.000]  trying to get the 28 pages released and i go after the soddies and i go after you know you go after
[02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:03.320]  them and then we're really reaching over a billion people a month on social networks hundreds of
[02:41:03.320 --> 02:41:08.040]  millions on the videos tens of millions every week on the websites and and and the radio show
[02:41:08.600 --> 02:41:12.920]  and it just really really scares them and they understand hey we take this guy out
[02:41:14.120 --> 02:41:18.120]  it'll make him a martyr but if we don't he just keeps getting bigger because everything he talked
[02:41:18.120 --> 02:41:21.960]  about everything his people talked about now out in the open his credibility is going up
[02:41:21.960 --> 02:41:27.720]  we can't just call him a kook who believes in martians all day and so uh you know i said it i
[02:41:27.720 --> 02:41:32.280]  told you privately i said launching this network and making the system more serious and having the
[02:41:32.280 --> 02:41:38.600]  fancy sets and sending reporters out is going to really get their attention and is really going
[02:41:38.600 --> 02:41:43.720]  to have them you know do this so we knew what we were doing and i believe out of whatever comes
[02:41:43.720 --> 02:41:47.640]  of this we're only going to reach more people and it's going to be more effective because
[02:41:47.640 --> 02:41:51.160]  everything that's been done to me stuff people wouldn't believe i'm not going to get into it
[02:41:51.160 --> 02:41:58.120]  it's off record it has just suddenly when one door closes something bad happens all this good
[02:41:58.120 --> 02:42:04.360]  stuff happens it's like angels come to our aid the prayers it is it is manifest destiny it is
[02:42:04.360 --> 02:42:09.240]  providence and i'm just humbled to be part of this and to be in the middle of it and to see
[02:42:09.240 --> 02:42:14.120]  what's happening that's why i tell you the crew you're part of something epic and big i mean
[02:42:14.120 --> 02:42:18.280]  though you've got a month ago they crunched the numbers and said alex it's a bigger audience
[02:42:18.280 --> 02:42:22.520]  you're using two-year-old numbers here's the audience and we look at it with computerized
[02:42:22.520 --> 02:42:29.880]  graphs i mean it's epic big and it's getting bigger and so we all better realize that we're
[02:42:29.880 --> 02:42:35.400]  part of something very serious and we should all operate like this is our last day on air
[02:42:35.400 --> 02:42:40.280]  our last article we're writing our last video report where we're really trying to lead people
[02:42:40.280 --> 02:42:44.520]  out of the new world order we're really trying to wake folks up this is a huge epic battle so
[02:42:44.520 --> 02:42:49.560]  god bless you david night appreciate those kind words and i've told david haven't i told you david
[02:42:49.560 --> 02:42:54.520]  that uh you know out all these reporters they're all doing a fabulous job i'm trying to groom

[02:47:53.480 --> 02:47:58.680]  in a pizza parlor the speech at the world trade center and it's all these world leaders together
[02:47:58.680 --> 02:48:02.760]  of world religions and on its face you know it does sound like a good thing you know everybody's
[02:48:02.760 --> 02:48:07.800]  coming here into unity but if you go for one world religion it's not gonna be one world christianity
[02:48:07.800 --> 02:48:13.320]  or one world islam or hindu or anything that your religion may be at home it's going to be this uh
[02:48:13.320 --> 02:48:18.920]  you know gumbo soup all these different things mixed in trying to create a uh politically
[02:48:18.920 --> 02:48:22.920]  correct religion and that's something that is prophesized in the book of revelations and people
[02:48:22.920 --> 02:48:28.520]  definitely need to be abreast of that as we go forward so out of the things i've heard so far
[02:48:28.520 --> 02:48:32.760]  why we've been covering over these past few days that's probably the most interesting thing to be
[02:48:32.760 --> 02:48:36.600]  but alice i guess that we're going to the break here but talk some about the reports that we've
[02:48:36.600 --> 02:48:41.880]  been filing talk about those amazing reports yes earlier this morning we started out at the u n
[02:48:41.880 --> 02:48:47.480]  building you know as we expected uh police blockage for several blocks in every direction uh david
[02:48:47.480 --> 02:48:52.280]  and i split up temporarily so we could cover as much ground as possible and while i was standing
[02:48:52.280 --> 02:48:55.960]  out there you know documenting all the things that were going on the police blockage the back
[02:48:55.960 --> 02:49:01.400]  checks all these type of things uh actor daniel craig you know james bond i was standing there and
[02:49:01.400 --> 02:49:05.720]  i was like that guy looks like that is james bond and he walks over and i'm just you know watching
[02:49:05.720 --> 02:49:09.480]  him and i just you know go for it i say mr craig what do you think about the pope being in town
[02:49:09.480 --> 02:49:14.440]  he said oh it's great or something like that it's very low uh audio whisper it pretty much to me
[02:49:14.440 --> 02:49:19.800]  and now he was walking towards the the u n center i'm not exactly sure if he went in but he was
[02:49:19.800 --> 02:49:23.400]  moving around in that direction but at the same time there are many hotels or other places he could
[02:49:23.400 --> 02:49:27.960]  be going over there and then david was out there getting some great footage as well talking to the
[02:49:27.960 --> 02:49:32.360]  people many people came out to see the pope uh thus far the majority of the people that we've
[02:49:32.360 --> 02:49:36.520]  met you know have positive feelings about the pope but every now and again we run into somebody
[02:49:36.520 --> 02:49:40.280]  says you know i'm not exactly sure about you know what the agenda is and it's not just about the
[02:49:40.280 --> 02:49:44.280]  pope but about the united nations about all these other world leaders that are coming in here and
[02:49:44.280 --> 02:49:49.560]  there's like i think there's more to this than uh is on the surface of this whole deal and then
[02:49:49.560 --> 02:49:55.080]  yesterday while we were still in dc we were asking people you guys may have saw the video david
[02:49:55.080 --> 02:49:59.320]  did talking about the worship service for the earth they had you know a lot of uh big i don't
[02:49:59.320 --> 02:50:03.720]  want to say big but they had a lot of a musical acts out there and david was telling me that like
[02:50:03.720 --> 02:50:08.600]  they expected the numbers to be in the thousands there's maybe a thousand people out there you
[02:50:08.600 --> 02:50:13.080]  know of course uh david thousand two hundred thousand okay so they anticipated the numbers for
[02:50:13.080 --> 02:50:17.800]  this uh event to be two hundred thousand of course there are many people at the capital but at this
[02:50:17.800 --> 02:50:22.040]  musical event you know there's maybe a thousand or so people out there to hear this message of
[02:50:22.040 --> 02:50:26.840]  climate change everybody's saying that oh we have to do this for the earth and name dropping leonardo
[02:50:26.840 --> 02:50:32.280]  de caprio and all these other shenanigans that were going on out there but people need to realize
[02:50:32.280 --> 02:50:37.960]  just like the people i talked to them all right jacari skype just broke up as we're going to break

[02:55:38.120 --> 02:55:43.320]  pop girl was staged well the police leader up there it's totally staged they just lie and say

[02:55:51.480 --> 02:55:56.680]  salons written a couple articles last week about pedophilia and pedophiles being nice people
[02:55:57.640 --> 02:56:03.080]  so i'm very proud that they've attacked me again alex jones wild eyed pope frances attack
[02:56:03.080 --> 02:56:08.040]  breaking down the shock jocks latest unhinged conspiracy theory and they say i'm wrong the
[02:56:08.040 --> 02:56:13.800]  vatican doesn't own the most land it's the third biggest owner of land with 177 million acres well
[02:56:13.800 --> 02:56:17.960]  yeah i said queen elizabeth's number two and the saudi's number three i've seen different
[02:56:17.960 --> 02:56:23.000]  numbers than you and the vatican admittedly hides a lot of its wealth okay so the point is they got
[02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:30.360]  177 million acres and trillions and trillions they can take all the illegal aliens and pay for it
[02:56:30.360 --> 02:56:35.560]  which they don't instead of telling me i need to okay that's what i said i'm sick of it i'm sick of
[02:56:35.560 --> 02:56:41.320]  communists always big rich people want me to get my money to poor people so they can be their slaves
[02:56:41.320 --> 02:56:47.480]  on some global plantation clowered piven jacari jackson you got cut off by the break my compadre
[02:56:48.120 --> 02:56:53.080]  just just as a person what do you make of this i mean the media has gone from attacking catholics
[02:56:53.080 --> 02:56:58.920]  most of the time because they were conservative to just drooling over this guy uh i mean are you
[02:56:58.920 --> 02:57:04.120]  gonna break down and cry if you see him oh absolutely not alexie like uh david was talking
[02:57:04.120 --> 02:57:08.680]  about the other day how we were watching fox news and they just would not say anything negative about
[02:57:08.680 --> 02:57:13.000]  the pope i'm not saying you have to attack the guy but just uh catholicism you know everybody
[02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:17.080]  they had all these catholics on to talk about how great it is and like so it's not bashing catholics
[02:57:17.080 --> 02:57:22.040]  it's just like this one singular we will not say anything negative about this guy you know just
[02:57:22.040 --> 02:57:27.160]  like don't say something about jim zones it's a cult would you agree that clearly he's he's becoming
[02:57:27.160 --> 02:57:32.280]  a cult leader i say the way people react to him is a very cultist way like i said they will not
[02:57:32.280 --> 02:57:36.440]  criticize the man for any reason they won't talk about the private planes or the vatican or the
[02:57:36.440 --> 02:57:40.280]  walls and just like you were talking about with all the immigrants if they want to house these guys
[02:57:40.280 --> 02:57:44.680]  in the vatican or in the white house or in some other facility more power to them but they're not
[02:57:44.680 --> 02:57:49.000]  doing that they're sending them to little towns in south texas and other places and telling those
[02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:53.240]  people to pay for them when they're encouraging them to come over and of course yes we know the
[02:57:53.240 --> 02:57:57.880]  u.s has a lot of uh hand and white people are fleeing these countries but the u.s needs to own
[02:57:57.880 --> 02:58:01.960]  up to it and stop going over to those countries in the first place and messing them up and if they
[02:58:01.960 --> 02:58:07.080]  stop doing that we wouldn't have half the problem that we have i think even uh the leader of asyria
[02:58:07.080 --> 02:58:11.400]  came out of sod and he said the u.s is a reason so many people are fleeing syria and he does have
[02:58:11.400 --> 02:58:16.040]  a point when he brings that up he's absolutely right but most of them are invaders that came into
[02:58:16.040 --> 02:58:21.160]  syria wanting to take over and get new houses and steal swimming pools literally and so they're
[02:58:21.160 --> 02:58:25.160]  now being kicked out so we're getting a bunch of g-hotties from all over the middle east i mean
[02:58:25.800 --> 02:58:31.080]  76 percent in one wave 90 plus percent another are military age men it turns out they're mainly
[02:58:31.080 --> 02:58:37.800]  g-hotties and so this is the defeated al-qaeda army uh coming into europe jacari stay there

[03:00:24.600 --> 03:00:29.880]  slash tv studio the original studio hosting the fourth hour jacari jackson you got cut off by
[03:00:29.880 --> 03:00:37.000]  the break again my friend uh you were uh getting into just if you have logic this guy that represents
[03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:43.160]  an organization worth hundreds of trillions 177 million acres we know of not mentioning vatican
[03:00:43.160 --> 03:00:48.120]  companies subsidiaries more like 300 million but i've done my research and they have debunking
[03:00:48.120 --> 03:00:53.480]  articles going he's the third largest owner not the first i mean oh you're just credited alex
[03:00:54.440 --> 03:01:00.520]  well on my point is they're not taking any of these quote immigrants or migrants that that in in
[03:01:00.520 --> 03:01:06.920]  syria would chop a catholic's head off i mean this is sick go ahead oh like just like you said
[03:01:06.920 --> 03:01:11.480]  they want everybody else to take care of people that they're encouraging to come into various
[03:01:11.480 --> 03:01:15.080]  countries and as i said in the last second yes some people have a very legitimate reason for
[03:01:15.080 --> 03:01:19.720]  fleeing but when you have people like the pope like obama who are encouraging them to go to
[03:01:19.720 --> 03:01:23.800]  certain places it's really ultimately their responsibility to take care of those people
[03:01:23.800 --> 03:01:28.680]  especially people like obama or other people who are going into other countries and causing a conflict
[03:01:28.680 --> 03:01:33.240]  in the first place and it's not just obama you have things with uh with the bushes as well so
[03:01:33.240 --> 03:01:37.960]  it's not just him but we have a long line of this going into other countries messing them up and then
[03:01:37.960 --> 03:01:42.440]  saying oh we can come here because we want to use yeah and the very same politicians and the globalists
[03:01:42.440 --> 03:01:47.720]  that did that and that won our guns and then advertised the free anchor baby stuff are the ones
[03:01:47.720 --> 03:01:54.200]  destabilizing the country shifting gears because it's a big story i had one the informant is well
[03:01:54.200 --> 03:01:58.200]  known threatened me then i had another fb agent warned me about a year and a half ago i told david
[03:01:58.200 --> 03:02:02.520]  for the people about it privately and then i had another high-level source say no i talked to somebody
[03:02:02.520 --> 03:02:07.000]  on the high level in the task force that they've been ordered by the white house to find something
[03:02:07.720 --> 03:02:13.560]  and uh i mean so this is real this is going on and i guess is what we should expect in this
[03:02:13.560 --> 03:02:19.480]  corrupt country but man jukari what's your take on the news about uh obama plans to shut down news
[03:02:19.480 --> 03:02:25.000]  organization if he can well i definitely can understand they're looking at us because they
[03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:28.920]  want to take us down just like i was there a couple years ago i think was what i've been there about
[03:02:28.920 --> 03:02:33.080]  three or four months and the secret service shows up talking about something uh some guy
[03:02:33.080 --> 03:02:37.240]  wrote in a comment section on planning info wars i believe it was just any excuse they can to come
[03:02:37.240 --> 03:02:41.400]  after us they come after us and now like i guess they're coming after the uh the products line
[03:02:41.400 --> 03:02:45.400]  because they couldn't come after you in the other way so even if this falls flat i wouldn't be
[03:02:45.400 --> 03:02:49.560]  surprised that they come after us again but they know that a lot of you know when we come out and
[03:02:49.560 --> 03:02:53.640]  we expose things uh the obama administration is doing going back to the bush administration and
[03:02:53.640 --> 03:02:57.880]  the clinton administration is not just picking on one guy that really makes these people nervous
[03:02:57.880 --> 03:03:01.960]  to know that we're out there putting out this information and then people can backtrack and
[03:03:01.960 --> 03:03:06.440]  they can see uh other uh predictions that you made that came true like before i started working for
[03:03:06.440 --> 03:03:10.520]  you alex i went back about some year old like mike hands and archives type stuff and i saw you
[03:03:10.520 --> 03:03:14.120]  out there talking about how street lights were looking at people well that's not true and now
[03:03:14.680 --> 03:03:18.280]  street lights on every corner and you said uh your cell phone and all these other things
[03:03:18.280 --> 03:03:22.600]  going to be spying on you and then was on cn cnn news a couple years ago they're saying put a piece
[03:03:22.600 --> 03:03:26.840]  of tape over your tv so it can't look at you so people know that what you're saying is coming
[03:03:26.840 --> 03:03:32.600]  true they just don't want to admit it i had engineers bring me in like about in 98 the manuals
[03:03:32.600 --> 03:03:37.240]  for fake transformers and cameras and light poles and they showed me where they were and then i'd
[03:03:37.240 --> 03:03:42.040]  i'd get death threats and attacked when i talked about it and hidden cameras in the in the in the
[03:03:42.040 --> 03:03:47.560]  cable boxes and i mean i i i know i wish this stuff wasn't true and in closing jacarys since you
[03:03:47.560 --> 03:03:53.320]  mentioned it there are so many other examples of this it's like we had a guy death threatening in
[03:03:53.320 --> 03:03:57.160]  the comments so they show up here they could have gone to the service that was doing it you know in
[03:03:57.160 --> 03:04:02.440]  guidance they're supposed to and then they start the fbis that called started asking me about the
[03:04:02.440 --> 03:04:06.760]  obama deception it was about to come out and then he starts calling around the office to other people
[03:04:06.760 --> 03:04:12.600]  did we want to do something to obama so they just use that as an excuse to try to intimidate my staff
[03:04:12.600 --> 03:04:18.440]  it's just crazy i just wonder how they get these people jacari to be this dirty i mean because
[03:04:18.440 --> 03:04:23.560]  that's dirty messing with us oh yeah like i said any way they can they're going to try to shut you
[03:04:23.560 --> 03:04:28.200]  down but you know like i said we gotta expect these type of things like they have happened before
[03:04:28.200 --> 03:04:32.520]  any excuse they can they're going to come after us so we just try to be uh the best
[03:04:32.520 --> 03:04:36.200]  prepared that we can well jacari i appreciate your courage and there's also a lot of good people in
[03:04:36.200 --> 03:04:40.520]  the fbi and that's why we know about this type of stuff i'm gonna point that out most of them are
[03:04:40.520 --> 03:04:45.560]  horrified but they have a special unit out of dc they're the type of folks that brought you okay see
[03:04:45.560 --> 03:04:50.360]  i mean these are some nasty people and just pray for us thank you jacari thank you for your courage
[03:04:50.360 --> 03:04:55.160]  that a wonderful thank you a wonderful team and i praise god every day for him there are no
[03:04:55.160 --> 03:05:01.240]  atheists at foxholes and jesus is my rock over the weekend charol akinson released the following
[03:05:01.240 --> 03:05:06.280]  article what the news isn't saying about vaccine autism studies she starts off with the new england
[03:05:06.280 --> 03:05:11.240]  journal of medicine study that says there is no link between vaccines and autism she then discloses
[03:05:11.240 --> 03:05:15.800]  the consulting firm behind the study the luan group lists major vaccine makers among its clients in
[03:05:15.800 --> 03:05:20.200]  fact the luan group's parent company united health group is a key government partner in obama care
[03:05:20.200 --> 03:05:25.320]  and a subsidiary of united health group qssi was given the contract to build the obama care website
[03:05:25.320 --> 03:05:29.640]  she then looks at the astroturf propaganda campaign and some of the buzzwords they use like
[03:05:29.640 --> 03:05:34.840]  weak too small haphazard not replicated junk science flawed unrelated and how these words are
[03:05:34.840 --> 03:05:39.960]  used over and over again to attack anybody who questions the vaccine mafia she then covers over
[03:05:39.960 --> 03:05:44.840]  13 different studies that show a correlation between vaccine intake and brain damage in fact
[03:05:44.840 --> 03:05:49.320]  permanent brain damage is an acknowledged rare side effect of vaccines and there's no dispute
[03:05:49.320 --> 03:05:53.480]  in that arena so the next time your herd mentality friends are pushing vaccine propaganda in your

[03:09:07.720 --> 03:09:10.760]  while we do have some differences we definitely have to and we have to point out the corruption
[03:09:10.760 --> 03:09:16.360]  we do have to at the end work together to fix these problems but first before we get to all that
[03:09:17.000 --> 03:09:23.880]  this came out of the ap today and we posted it up on info wars immigration group plan pope girl
[03:09:23.880 --> 03:09:31.400]  plan girls pope encounter for a year now i want to call your the the article of this came out in
[03:09:31.400 --> 03:09:41.480]  the daily mail at 926 eastern on the 24th and or no on 1747 so on the 23rd i'm sorry and then it
[03:09:41.480 --> 03:09:47.000]  was updated on the 24th i posted a tweet the 23rd as soon as i saw this i looked at the pictures i
[03:09:47.000 --> 03:09:51.960]  said does anyone else smell a hashtag bs hashtag pr hashtag stunt i just happened to have a t-shirt
[03:09:51.960 --> 03:09:57.640]  and letter and uh slipped through security yeah how how do we have this multi-million
[03:09:57.640 --> 03:10:01.800]  dollar security apparatus around this little girl happens to slip through she's got a ready-made
[03:10:01.800 --> 03:10:07.480]  t-shirt uh a very eloquent letter that she gave to the pope i think we have a b-roll of that of
[03:10:07.480 --> 03:10:12.200]  just the and then uh who was it leo zagami pointed out yesterday that the man actually holding the
[03:10:12.200 --> 03:10:18.120]  little girl up the bald man there is a a knight's amalta uh general and he is uh one of the pope's
[03:10:18.120 --> 03:10:24.200]  head of security so it was all staged here it is out of the ap so fia cruz's brief encounter
[03:10:24.200 --> 03:10:29.080]  with pro francis during his parade in washington appeared to be a kind of spontaneous moment
[03:10:29.080 --> 03:10:33.160]  that is so enduring about the pope and initially has a young child wrapping an arm around his neck
[03:10:33.160 --> 03:10:38.920]  and he offers a kiss and a blessing but five-year-old sophie uh the moment unfolded perfectly as it
[03:10:38.920 --> 03:10:43.800]  was scripted by members of a coalition of of a los angeles-based immigrant rights group they had
[03:10:43.800 --> 03:10:48.360]  been preparing for nearly a year for the young girl from suburban los angeles to make a dash to
[03:10:48.360 --> 03:10:52.680]  the pope mobile to deliver the message she's luckily nobody decided to you know taser or
[03:10:52.680 --> 03:10:57.640]  anything because people have been known uh you look at these places uh in the mid east
[03:10:57.640 --> 03:11:01.880]  when they do use children as suicide bombers so it's not out of the ordinary that that could
[03:11:01.880 --> 03:11:06.760]  have happened um they even pulled off similar public relations cool year ago in room using a
[03:11:06.760 --> 03:11:11.080]  10-year-old girl with the pope we plan on doing this from the moment we learn he was coming to
[03:11:11.080 --> 03:11:18.280]  the united states as one jose gutierre's of full rights for immigration coalition and you know
[03:11:18.280 --> 03:11:25.000]  he makes it act like or sound like that the u.s doesn't even bring in anybody and uh any
[03:11:25.000 --> 03:11:29.320]  immigrants into the united states here here's an article out of i think it's the washington post
[03:11:29.320 --> 03:11:35.720]  pope calls for immigration leniency unlikely to change debate and you go towards the end of this
[03:11:35.720 --> 03:11:40.600]  we have a statement here from representative michael burge of texas the thing that always strikes
[03:11:40.600 --> 03:11:44.360]  me is when we get into these discussions is the united states takes in more people every year
[03:11:44.360 --> 03:11:48.680]  legally than the rest of the world combined and we had the biggest prison population we also take
[03:11:48.680 --> 03:11:53.320]  in the most immigrants you start from that premise it was 1.7 million last year you want to add another
[03:11:53.320 --> 03:11:57.400]  400 to 600 thousand that came in without the benefit of doing it the right way what is the
[03:11:57.400 --> 03:12:01.960]  right number if over 2 million is not enough and someone please tell me what the right number is
[03:12:01.960 --> 03:12:07.000]  and i would uh encourage other countries to act accordingly the vatican fritz part welcomes
[03:12:07.000 --> 03:12:12.200]  millions of visitors each year i was one of them earlier this year but always allows for a very
[03:12:12.200 --> 03:12:17.640]  select few who meet the strict criteria to be admitted as residents are citizens so they have
[03:12:18.200 --> 03:12:22.360]  high high immigration laws in place they have giant walls around their
[03:12:22.360 --> 03:12:26.840]  vatican city which is a sovereign nation they have their own security they don't go by any
[03:12:26.840 --> 03:12:31.000]  other laws except their own they're able to cover things up that way especially when it comes to
[03:12:31.000 --> 03:12:38.440]  pedophilia or uh our gay sex with these priests and but we're supposed to take in everybody in
[03:12:38.440 --> 03:12:43.960]  the world and we're racist if we don't do it that's the story out there there's some
[03:12:43.960 --> 03:12:48.600]  pictures of the wall you know look at look how high those are that nobody you know
[03:12:49.800 --> 03:12:53.480]  that's a big ladder you're gonna have to get her a giant tunnel and it's all surrounded
[03:12:53.480 --> 03:12:57.960]  by roads and bridges and you know let me tell you vatican city is an amazing place with
[03:12:57.960 --> 03:13:01.400]  what they've done with it but that's what you do when you're able to take all the wealth and
[03:13:01.400 --> 03:13:05.880]  launder drug money and do all kinds of other things and yet you basically don't have to
[03:13:05.880 --> 03:13:11.240]  face any laws and so what's going on with this immigration crisis in europe right now
[03:13:11.240 --> 03:13:15.000]  daily mail is reporting rape and child abuse are rife in german refugee camps
[03:13:15.000 --> 03:13:19.960]  unsegregated conditions blamed as women are seen as fair game in overcrowded migrant centers
[03:13:20.920 --> 03:13:26.440]  so uh campaigners claim that they saw unaccompanied that men there are seeing unaccompanied
[03:13:26.440 --> 03:13:31.560]  women as fair game and also they blame the conditions in which occupants were unsegregated
[03:13:31.560 --> 03:13:36.520]  by gender or nationality they're just sticking people and fenced in areas and hoping they get
[03:13:36.520 --> 03:13:41.480]  along but when you have if you could see the pictures for yourself it's not a majority of
[03:13:41.480 --> 03:13:45.880]  families going into these centers it's a majority of young males and what are young males full
[03:13:45.880 --> 03:13:50.840]  of they're full of testosterone and that's what you're going to get and then you have
[03:13:50.840 --> 03:13:54.600]  people that maybe lost their husband so they're fleeing women with their children
[03:13:54.600 --> 03:14:01.720]  and they're being fair game there's there's claims of uh child sex and uh and rape among the women so
[03:14:02.280 --> 03:14:07.960]  that's what's going on in germany right now really makes you wonder now we have on info wars
[03:14:07.960 --> 03:14:13.320]  of going back to pope kid i encourage you to go watch the interview that uh david or uh
[03:14:13.320 --> 03:14:17.240]  is it darin mcbreen and kit daniels did yesterday pope kid what they don't want you to know that's
[03:14:17.240 --> 03:14:21.880]  up on info wars in our featured section and a pretty funny moment there were kit daniels
[03:14:21.880 --> 03:14:27.800]  actually calls the pope pope marks he has a Freudian slip because he is a Marxist wanting to have
[03:14:28.600 --> 03:14:34.600]  you know us live without air conditioning or tv or anything else that that you know a modern
[03:14:34.600 --> 03:14:39.720]  society has he's trying to sell the agenda that we should not have this we should all
[03:14:40.280 --> 03:14:45.480]  live as one under the the trees i guess and but that's the thing humans have created
[03:14:45.480 --> 03:14:50.440]  this environment and you know we are liable for the pollution that we put out in this
[03:14:50.440 --> 03:14:54.760]  world like the geoengineering that the pope won't talk about you know that's never on the table it's
[03:14:54.760 --> 03:15:01.000]  never geoengineering or fluoride in the water supply or the drugs that get into the water supply
[03:15:01.000 --> 03:15:06.200]  there's all kinds of stuff that that they put chemically into our bodies to change us to keep
[03:15:06.200 --> 03:15:12.200]  this dumb down and stupid but i want to uh go now to a video this is uh done by jacari jackson
[03:15:12.200 --> 03:15:17.640]  and david night public rides buses so pope can fly in a private jet that's right the pope admits
[03:15:17.640 --> 03:15:23.800]  572 tons of co2 during his trip but he's telling us we can't have air conditioning right now there's
[03:15:23.800 --> 03:15:28.280]  uh the air conditioning seemed to froze in this little studio so maybe the pope has prayed that
[03:15:28.280 --> 03:15:31.880]  info wars does not get its air conditioning as well so let's go to that report
[03:15:36.200 --> 03:15:43.480]  i accomplished so much good throughout the history of the united states
[03:15:43.480 --> 03:15:50.520]  what do you think of the pope's speech it was fabulous i'm not even catholic and i think he's
[03:15:50.520 --> 03:15:55.880]  wonderful what do you think of his views on climate change i support them yeah i think
[03:15:55.880 --> 03:16:01.400]  enough's enough i mean i'm not somebody that's been a huge huge advocate for climate change but
[03:16:01.400 --> 03:16:06.840]  just seeing the people here today and hearing the pope you really realize that it's a it's
[03:16:06.840 --> 03:16:13.320]  something we need to be very proactive with and take steps today to ultimately make it better tomorrow
[03:16:13.320 --> 03:16:17.800]  and what are you doing to reduce your carbon footprint i take the bus to work quite a bit
[03:16:17.800 --> 03:16:24.680]  i'll take the train try not to drive into work when when possible and really focus on public
[03:16:24.680 --> 03:16:32.200]  transportation and what will you do to reduce your carbon footprint um recycling that's i do that all
[03:16:32.200 --> 03:16:40.680]  the time i'm driving a prius well okay he didn't use the words climate change and he didn't use the
[03:16:40.680 --> 03:16:46.360]  word climate once um he did like speak on a lot of powerful things like poverty the death penalty
[03:16:46.360 --> 03:16:53.640]  um just environmental degradation overall um i think he maybe might have done that to not step
[03:16:53.640 --> 03:16:59.560]  on people's feet to let the ignorant be ignorant um but hear what he had to say which is a start
[03:16:59.560 --> 03:17:06.200]  which is more than nothing so we're more than happy to have been a part of this historical event
[03:17:06.200 --> 03:17:11.320]  today that was awesome are you guys doing anything to lessen your carbon footprints i mean we took
[03:17:11.320 --> 03:17:16.200]  a bus here there's like 50 of us that came from school so we took one bus as opposed to multiple
[03:17:16.200 --> 03:17:22.280]  cars um we did that we always turn our lights off we always recycle too we're doing environmental
[03:17:22.280 --> 03:17:28.520]  studies so we're environmental studies majors yeah and what else oh we don't drive no don't
[03:17:28.520 --> 03:17:33.560]  we never drive is it just a temporary thing i mean i still don't know how to drive so who knows
[03:17:33.560 --> 03:17:43.000]  really i'm 18 yeah wow those are some uh climate terrorists right there they don't drive they don't
[03:17:43.000 --> 03:17:48.520]  do anything you know they they recycle they turn off their lights they're very good good citizens
[03:17:48.520 --> 03:17:54.280]  and they're big they've been programmed like that since i guess she's 18 now that one girl was so
[03:17:54.280 --> 03:17:59.000]  you know late 90s she was born definitely a millennial and that's what they've been doing
[03:17:59.000 --> 03:18:05.480]  is programming the younger generation so as they grow up they take these values and instill them
[03:18:05.480 --> 03:18:10.040]  in their kids and then that's how they change society so it takes usually a generation or two
[03:18:10.040 --> 03:18:14.920]  or generation and a half to make this happen but they're definitely working on it unless you talk
[03:18:14.920 --> 03:18:20.760]  to my kids my kids are not falling for the propaganda and we talk about it all the time
[03:18:20.760 --> 03:18:27.880]  uh this morning the pope was at the un he also went to the 9-11 memorial and did a multicultural
[03:18:30.040 --> 03:18:33.880]  multicultural type religious ceremony with all the religions getting together
[03:18:33.880 --> 03:18:39.880]  to show that all religions are the same and can well who knows we're going to see a report from
[03:18:39.880 --> 03:18:44.760]  david night later on about that but right now i want to get to his un agenda is not about
[03:18:44.760 --> 03:18:51.800]  sustainability it's not it's about total control and having a small pyramid of very very wealthy
[03:18:51.800 --> 03:18:58.920]  powerful people on top and lots of plebs underneath holding up the golden throne so let's go to that
[03:18:58.920 --> 03:19:10.680]  report for war side com i'm david night and as we see from this perspective we can see a little
[03:19:10.680 --> 03:19:15.960]  bit of the un but of course you can see a lot more the police the perimeter extends two blocks on
[03:19:15.960 --> 03:19:21.800]  either side of the road that 40 43rd street that goes down to the un and of course that you can't
[03:19:21.800 --> 03:19:25.880]  get any closer than second street which is a couple blocks away it's a huge perimeter that put around
[03:19:25.880 --> 03:19:31.480]  here thousands and thousands of police officers this is what it's come to this is the total police
[03:19:31.480 --> 03:19:36.280]  state but what is this ultimate objective this ultimate objective is not to protect one individual
[03:19:36.280 --> 03:19:42.680]  ultimate objective is to set down a new agenda for sustainability this is what the UN spokesman
[03:19:42.680 --> 03:19:47.960]  on the news are openly saying there it is the new agenda for sustainability you can watch that one

[03:25:35.240 --> 03:25:39.640]  calls right now we have uh charles from georgia looks like he's been holding the longest one's
[03:25:39.640 --> 03:25:45.880]  talking about the pope charles what's going on how you doing mr ruff i'm doing good charles
[03:25:45.880 --> 03:25:50.760]  from the nation are true and uh i was i just called in i said i'm just curious about this
[03:25:50.760 --> 03:25:56.680]  pope we've been hearing a lot about him and uh you've got a lot of uh cult followers behind him
[03:25:57.720 --> 03:26:03.640]  let me ask you could he be the pope uh which is the false prophet that could usher in the
[03:26:03.640 --> 03:26:09.240]  false messiah because all these people that are worshiping him uh could be the same people that
[03:26:09.240 --> 03:26:14.600]  worship the false messiah uh i just want to get your take on that well that's the thing about a
[03:26:14.600 --> 03:26:19.720]  cult of personality it is hard to judge and i think a lot of people are growing up and when
[03:26:19.720 --> 03:26:22.520]  they grow up they're talking you know if they're especially if they're catholic or christian
[03:26:22.520 --> 03:26:28.520]  now is they're brought into this uh mindset of the pope is all powerful and that's that's the
[03:26:28.520 --> 03:26:33.000]  end of the line for christianity right there is the pope and so he's always held in reverence
[03:26:33.000 --> 03:26:39.800]  and i think you have a lot of people who buy into what he's saying a lot of people agree with him on
[03:26:39.800 --> 03:26:45.400]  these environmental uh policies that he wants to implement and that's the agenda and that's
[03:26:45.960 --> 03:26:53.000]  it all goes to the training but is this guy the false prophet is he the anti christ who knows
[03:26:53.000 --> 03:26:59.080]  he's probably just another hatchet man for the new world order uh he's just bringing it in slowly
[03:26:59.080 --> 03:27:03.400]  but surely now the next pope will get a little more draconian on environment he'll say hey well
[03:27:03.400 --> 03:27:08.360]  you don't even need houses we should all just be living in tents because the house uses a lot of
[03:27:08.360 --> 03:27:13.480]  energy and we don't need to be using this energy so they'll have a scattered about in fields or in
[03:27:13.480 --> 03:27:18.680]  giant uh camps somewhere so i guess i hope that answers your question charles thanks for calling
[03:27:18.680 --> 03:27:22.120]  next up is frank in new york wants to talk about immigration frank how you doing
[03:27:22.120 --> 03:27:31.160]  hey ron how are you i'm fine great um if you look at the mic report um it actually does state that

[03:30:08.200 --> 03:30:13.000]  which many have labeled christianized marxism the other reason why communism and socialism has
[03:30:13.000 --> 03:30:17.880]  persevered for so long in latin america and it's not a coincidence that cuba's current leader rile
[03:30:17.880 --> 03:30:23.240]  castro crazed pope francis for his anti-cafless stance castro like francis was also brought up
[03:30:23.240 --> 03:30:28.760]  by the jezz witz starting to make sense now why francis is constantly calling for carbon taxes

[03:32:59.800 --> 03:33:03.400]  everybody knows me knows that i get emotional about certain things
[03:33:07.400 --> 03:33:09.000]  and i think the top of our list
[03:33:11.640 --> 03:33:17.160]  is providing for the safety and security of the american people when are we gonna defeat them
[03:33:17.160 --> 03:33:22.200]  no no no my nose that wasn't no it's not what set you off that time
[03:33:22.200 --> 03:33:50.200]  you're making sure uh that these kids have a shot at the american ring my car is important
[03:33:50.200 --> 03:33:58.680]  Myself through school, working every rotten job there was.
[03:33:58.680 --> 03:34:05.520]  I want to make sure every kid has the same chance.
[03:34:05.520 --> 03:34:10.560]  The Alex Jones show, because there is a war on, for your mind.
[03:34:10.560 --> 03:34:15.280]  Oh my gosh, you should start crying, put it back on screen.
[03:34:15.280 --> 03:34:18.560]  Kids, I certainly don't want the institution to go through this.
[03:34:18.560 --> 03:34:22.720]  He's got the tissue out.
[03:34:22.720 --> 03:34:27.160]  Poor boner, resigned today under pressure from Walter Jones and others.
[03:34:27.160 --> 03:34:31.960]  We had Walter Jones earlier on the show today, breaking all that down with Alex.
[03:34:31.960 --> 03:34:36.360]  And that's just amazing that we finally are getting rid of John Boehner, but they will
[03:34:36.360 --> 03:34:40.640]  be replacing Boehner Boehner with somebody else.
[03:34:40.640 --> 03:34:44.440]  Probably equally as bad, another acolyte of evil.
[03:34:44.440 --> 03:34:48.840]  Now before we show you what a Trump supporter looks like, which I'm very interested to
[03:34:48.840 --> 03:34:49.840]  see.
[03:34:49.840 --> 03:34:53.160]  Well, we have 20% off brain force right now.
[03:34:53.160 --> 03:34:55.200]  You can talk to Anthony, Alex, or both on this.
[03:34:55.200 --> 03:34:57.040]  I started taking it a couple days ago.
[03:34:57.040 --> 03:35:03.920]  Boom, it wakes you up really quickly and not in a jittery sort of way, but just more alert.
[03:35:03.920 --> 03:35:04.920]  More alert looking around.
[03:35:04.920 --> 03:35:10.720]  And if you're watching me now, I'm showing you how I look around alertly after taking
[03:35:10.720 --> 03:35:14.880]  brain force and also child ease is back very popular.
[03:35:14.880 --> 03:35:19.520]  It's a pretty big bottle of liquid that you can give to your kids to help calm them down,
[03:35:19.520 --> 03:35:23.520]  especially in this world where kids can get distracted very easily.
[03:35:23.520 --> 03:35:25.880]  I want to read a couple of comments here.
[03:35:25.880 --> 03:35:28.960]  This is from Button in Canada helped me focus in a calm, natural way.
[03:35:28.960 --> 03:35:31.080]  So I guess Button takes it as an adult.
[03:35:31.080 --> 03:35:34.600]  I take it with super male vitality and other info or combinations.
[03:35:34.600 --> 03:35:36.600]  This is by Carl in the UK.
[03:35:36.600 --> 03:35:40.840]  Because what it says, regular customer never been let down.
[03:35:40.840 --> 03:35:45.080]  So try child ease if you have some children or even maybe try it on yourself.
[03:35:45.080 --> 03:35:50.920]  If you're an adult, see if it helps you calm your nerves, get you focused, and also try
[03:35:50.920 --> 03:35:51.920]  brain force.
[03:35:51.920 --> 03:35:59.840]  It's all 20% off with brain force right now at infowarstore.com, infowarstore.com, or infowarslife.com.
[03:35:59.840 --> 03:36:04.560]  Now Trump is leading in the polls still 26%.
[03:36:04.560 --> 03:36:08.240]  Charlie Fiorina is trailing now 16%.
[03:36:08.240 --> 03:36:14.720]  And this is a poll done, it looks like by New Hampshire primary poll, it's from CNN.
[03:36:14.720 --> 03:36:19.400]  And then it's followed by Marco Rubio, Ben Carson, Jeb Bush, and John Kasich.
[03:36:19.400 --> 03:36:24.040]  Of course, they don't mention Rand Paul anywhere.
[03:36:24.040 --> 03:36:27.360]  Rand Paul 3%, they do finally mention him down there.
[03:36:27.360 --> 03:36:28.440]  Joe Biggs put this together.
[03:36:28.440 --> 03:36:32.840]  Back on the 14th, he went to the Trump rally in Dallas.
[03:36:32.840 --> 03:36:35.800]  And he interviewed a lot of Trump supporters.
[03:36:35.800 --> 03:36:40.680]  And here's what they sound like and what is on their mind, which I think is pretty interesting.
[03:36:40.680 --> 03:36:42.680]  So here's that report.
[03:36:42.680 --> 03:37:12.520]  I'm not going to sit here and take it anymore.
[03:37:12.520 --> 03:37:26.400]  But they're all cheering for Joe Biggs right there, who's showing his Hillary for prison
[03:37:26.400 --> 03:37:27.400]  2016 t-shirt.
[03:37:27.400 --> 03:37:29.400]  And people want pictures with it.
[03:37:29.400 --> 03:37:30.400]  It's pretty amazing.
[03:37:30.400 --> 03:37:50.600]  I'm here to support Donald Trump, so why do you support Donald Trump?
[03:37:50.600 --> 03:37:56.160]  I think he can keep us all employed and great, great new jobs.
[03:37:56.160 --> 03:38:00.600]  So how do you feel about his stance on building a wall across the southern border?
[03:38:00.600 --> 03:38:01.600]  You think that's going to help?
[03:38:01.600 --> 03:38:02.600]  Oh boy.
[03:38:02.600 --> 03:38:03.600]  I think it could, yes.
[03:38:03.600 --> 03:38:04.600]  I like him a lot.
[03:38:04.600 --> 03:38:05.600]  I also like Jeb Bush.
[03:38:05.600 --> 03:38:06.600]  And the more I can learn about the two different positions, the more I will say I'm warming up
[03:38:06.600 --> 03:38:07.600]  to Trump more and more than I see him.
[03:38:07.600 --> 03:38:08.600]  I appreciate his candidness, his one talk, and I actually think his inexperience in politics,
[03:38:08.600 --> 03:38:31.600]  couldn't possibly turn out to be a big plus, and certainly has differentiated himself from
[03:38:31.600 --> 03:38:33.280]  most of the other candidates.
[03:38:33.280 --> 03:38:38.760]  I'm here because I love Donald Trump and it's great to be at a patriotic event with a bunch
[03:38:38.760 --> 03:38:41.280]  of people who also feel the same way about our country.
[03:38:41.280 --> 03:38:46.080]  I'm hoping to see some young people too because we really need to get on the ball and fix
[03:38:46.080 --> 03:38:51.280]  this country and we need someone who's going to get down to the root of it, get down to
[03:38:51.280 --> 03:38:53.280]  the main problem, and just go from there.
[03:38:53.280 --> 03:38:58.280]  And someone who knows how to win, which obviously he says all the time, he knows how to win
[03:38:58.280 --> 03:38:59.280]  and be successful.
[03:38:59.280 --> 03:39:04.280]  I'm an immigrant from Canada that did it right, I've been here for nine years and I don't have
[03:39:04.280 --> 03:39:07.280]  any documents because the government's oppressed me.
[03:39:07.280 --> 03:39:12.280]  They've done a lot of damage to my life, but I'm here to help Donald Trump campaign so
[03:39:12.280 --> 03:39:18.280]  he can make my situation right so I can help America.
[03:39:18.280 --> 03:39:20.280]  Joe Biggs here with infowars.com.
[03:39:20.280 --> 03:39:22.640]  Now we're standing outside of the American Airlines Center.
[03:39:22.640 --> 03:39:24.680]  Donald Trump just gave a speech.
[03:39:24.680 --> 03:39:27.680]  How are you guys feeling tonight after listening to Donald Trump's speech?
[03:39:27.680 --> 03:39:28.680]  Feeling good.
[03:39:28.680 --> 03:39:33.680]  I was skeptical first about having a comedian as a president, but it was fun.
[03:39:33.680 --> 03:39:35.680]  I think you can do a good job.
[03:39:35.680 --> 03:39:36.680]  I'm feeling great.
[03:39:36.680 --> 03:39:37.680]  I liked it.
[03:39:37.680 --> 03:39:38.680]  I got a good time.
[03:39:38.680 --> 03:39:40.680]  He was entertaining, but he did hit some of the issues.
[03:39:40.680 --> 03:39:41.680]  Are you all for him?
[03:39:41.680 --> 03:39:43.680]  I like what he's doing.
[03:39:43.680 --> 03:39:45.680]  I would lean more towards the Ted Cruz.
[03:39:45.680 --> 03:39:48.680]  He said like the anchor babies.
[03:39:48.680 --> 03:39:50.680]  People don't know that's not in the Constitution.
[03:39:50.680 --> 03:39:51.680]  It's not right.
[03:39:51.680 --> 03:39:54.680]  There's a lot of things, but I think what he's doing is great.
[03:39:54.680 --> 03:39:56.680]  He's bringing out a great conversation.
[03:39:56.680 --> 03:40:00.680]  He's changing the way that the politics are being run, and I'm all for it.
[03:40:00.680 --> 03:40:02.680]  Trump's amazing in person.
[03:40:02.680 --> 03:40:06.680]  It's like if you take what you see on TV and then multiply that by 10.
[03:40:06.680 --> 03:40:11.680]  And if two words to describe the way Trump comes across in person, I guess it would be
[03:40:11.680 --> 03:40:14.680]  authentic and spontaneous.
[03:40:14.680 --> 03:40:20.680]  So it's so different from most of the Washington politicians who he'd describe as more rehearsed
[03:40:20.680 --> 03:40:24.680]  and following a script, whereas Trump's presentation spontaneous, it seems real.
[03:40:24.680 --> 03:40:26.680]  It seems genuine and it seems unscripted.
[03:40:26.680 --> 03:40:31.680]  So when you came to this event tonight, how did you feel about Donald Trump before this?
[03:40:31.680 --> 03:40:33.680]  I've already been a fan of his.
[03:40:33.680 --> 03:40:35.680]  I like what he's been saying.
[03:40:35.680 --> 03:40:40.680]  I think he's bringing up a lot of issues that a lot of other people don't have the guts to
[03:40:40.680 --> 03:40:42.680]  actually bring up, and he's opening up the field.
[03:40:42.680 --> 03:40:44.680]  But I think I'm going to vote for him no matter what.
[03:40:44.680 --> 03:40:45.680]  What about you?
[03:40:45.680 --> 03:40:46.680]  I feel the same.
[03:40:46.680 --> 03:40:52.680]  We're from New York, so we like his bravado and the way, you know, like says things that
[03:40:52.680 --> 03:40:53.680]  no one else will.
[03:40:53.680 --> 03:40:57.680]  Donald like attacks Democrats and like says how he really feels and I like that.
[03:40:57.680 --> 03:41:01.680]  Behind me, there's a large group of anti-Trump protesters out here.
[03:41:01.680 --> 03:41:06.680]  The police are starting to move the line of people back this way, starting to get pretty
[03:41:06.680 --> 03:41:07.680]  hectic.
[03:41:07.680 --> 03:41:08.680]  Let's go see what's going on real quick.
[03:41:08.680 --> 03:41:09.680]  Come on.
[03:41:17.680 --> 03:41:18.680]  Wow.
[03:41:18.680 --> 03:41:19.680]  Check this out.
[03:41:19.680 --> 03:41:20.680]  Hey.
[03:41:20.680 --> 03:41:24.680]  So if you're just now getting here, there's a lot of stuff going on outside of the Trump
[03:41:24.680 --> 03:41:25.680]  protest.
[03:41:33.680 --> 03:41:36.680]  So as you can see, the police lines are starting to push back.
[03:41:36.680 --> 03:42:00.680]  There's a lot of people with Mexican flags.
[03:42:00.680 --> 03:42:05.680]  So there you got the Dallas PD who's out there with their dancing horses, keeping the protest
[03:42:05.680 --> 03:42:06.680]  at bay.
[03:42:06.680 --> 03:42:11.680]  Those who think Trump is a racist because he's saying things that a lot of things he's
[03:42:11.680 --> 03:42:15.680]  saying I think need to be said and you don't get politicians saying this stuff because
[03:42:15.680 --> 03:42:21.680]  there's there's no money in keeping illegal immigration out of this country.
[03:42:21.680 --> 03:42:22.680]  There's no money in that.
[03:42:22.680 --> 03:42:27.680]  And so I really like Trump's stance on illegal immigration except for building the wall.
[03:42:27.680 --> 03:42:29.680]  But that's a very interesting video.
[03:42:29.680 --> 03:42:30.680]  We're going to post that on info wars.
[03:42:30.680 --> 03:42:32.680]  I think Liam McAdoo might even play it tonight.
[03:42:32.680 --> 03:42:39.680]  Just gives you a real insight onto the Trump supporter and what he or she is all about.
[03:42:39.680 --> 03:42:42.680]  Now I want to change gears really.
[03:42:42.680 --> 03:42:44.680]  I'm going to make a 180 right now.
[03:42:44.680 --> 03:42:45.680]  This is out of Gizmodo.
[03:42:45.680 --> 03:42:49.680]  This is the definitive photograph of planet Earth.
[03:42:49.680 --> 03:42:54.680]  And this is unlike NASA's blue marble, which was a composite from any different photographs.
[03:42:54.680 --> 03:42:57.680]  This is a portrait of Earth taken in one single shot.
[03:42:57.680 --> 03:42:59.680]  It's the highest resolution image of our home planet.
[03:42:59.680 --> 03:43:06.680]  121 megapixels that was shot by the Russians.
[03:43:06.680 --> 03:43:09.680]  So it was a Russian satellite that shot that.
[03:43:09.680 --> 03:43:12.680]  And I think that is a very beautiful image of our Earth.
[03:43:12.680 --> 03:43:16.680]  The reds coming out of the deserts are really amazing.
[03:43:16.680 --> 03:43:18.680]  I mean, that is just deep color.
[03:43:18.680 --> 03:43:19.680]  Look at that.
[03:43:19.680 --> 03:43:20.680]  That's the planet we live on folks.
[03:43:20.680 --> 03:43:24.680]  That's where all this craziness is going on.
[03:43:24.680 --> 03:43:27.680]  All this craziness that we've created.
[03:43:27.680 --> 03:43:30.680]  And then I want to follow that up with...
[03:43:30.680 --> 03:43:33.680]  We posted this on Infowars earlier in the week.
[03:43:33.680 --> 03:43:36.680]  A scale model of the solar system in the Nevada desert.
[03:43:36.680 --> 03:43:42.680]  So a couple filmmakers wanted to recreate a scale model of the entire solar system.
[03:43:42.680 --> 03:43:44.680]  And they use an Earth the size of a marble.
[03:43:44.680 --> 03:43:48.680]  The filmmakers are Wiley Overstreet and Alex Garosh.
[03:43:48.680 --> 03:43:50.680]  So we're going to go through a few other...
[03:43:50.680 --> 03:43:51.680]  They put one video up.
[03:43:51.680 --> 03:43:53.680]  It's about an eight minute video, but I'm going to play some excerpts of it and analyze it.
[03:43:53.680 --> 03:43:57.680]  So this first video is why they decided to pull this off.
[03:43:57.680 --> 03:44:00.680]  Look up an image of the Earth and Moon.
[03:44:00.680 --> 03:44:04.680]  You're going to get a picture where they're quite close together.
[03:44:04.680 --> 03:44:06.680]  Something like that.
[03:44:06.680 --> 03:44:11.680]  But in reality, the Earth and Moon are about...
[03:44:11.680 --> 03:44:13.680]  About that far apart.
[03:44:13.680 --> 03:44:17.680]  That is the Earth and the Moon to scale.
[03:44:17.680 --> 03:44:20.680]  Taking the same concept, but for the solar system.
[03:44:20.680 --> 03:44:26.680]  Every single picture of the solar system that we ever encounter is not to scale.
[03:44:26.680 --> 03:44:32.680]  If you put the orbits to scale on a piece of paper, the planets become microscopic.
[03:44:32.680 --> 03:44:36.680]  And you won't be able to see them.
[03:44:36.680 --> 03:44:39.680]  So our solar system is vast.
[03:44:39.680 --> 03:44:42.680]  That is to say the least, especially when you get to those outer planets.
[03:44:42.680 --> 03:44:46.680]  So what they did was they went out to the Black Rock Desert and they placed the sun.
[03:44:46.680 --> 03:44:51.680]  It was about a two meter ball, and then they started tracing out the orbits that these planets make.
[03:44:51.680 --> 03:44:53.680]  And they're not all circular. They're somewhat more elliptical.
[03:44:53.680 --> 03:44:56.680]  And they attached little lights to these.
[03:44:56.680 --> 03:44:58.680]  And this, I'm going to show you first, the inner planets.
[03:44:58.680 --> 03:44:59.680]  So I hope you're watching.
[03:44:59.680 --> 03:45:05.680]  You can go to inforce.com forward slash show so you can actually see how beautiful the orbits are in time lapse fashions.
[03:45:05.680 --> 03:45:07.680]  Let's roll the inner planets.
[03:45:07.680 --> 03:45:14.680]  We have 36 hours to measure the distances, trace out the orbits, and set up a time lapse shot from up on top of a nearby mountain.
[03:45:14.680 --> 03:45:28.680]  To create a scale model with an Earth only as big as this marble, you need seven miles of empty space.
[03:45:28.680 --> 03:45:34.680]  So that's why we're here.
[03:45:34.680 --> 03:45:39.680]  Once the time lapse is ready, we'll drive each orbit with a light.
[03:45:39.680 --> 03:45:46.680]  Hopefully you'll be able to tell just how big they really are.
[03:45:46.680 --> 03:45:50.680]  Onward to the outer planets.
[03:45:50.680 --> 03:45:54.680]  So that was the inner planets, Mercury, Venus, the Earth, and then Mars.
[03:45:54.680 --> 03:45:55.680]  And then we have the asteroid belt.
[03:45:55.680 --> 03:46:01.680]  And then we have the outer planets of which they do neglect to use Pluto, which was a planet when I was a kid.
[03:46:01.680 --> 03:46:02.680]  Now it's not a planet anymore.
[03:46:02.680 --> 03:46:05.680]  But it's got moons, but it's not a planet.
[03:46:05.680 --> 03:46:08.680]  Anyway, here's a look at the outer planets and then all the orbits all together.
[03:46:08.680 --> 03:46:10.680]  So I hope you're watching m4s.com forward slash show.
[03:46:10.680 --> 03:46:16.680]  If you can't watch it now, this will be up on YouTube on the Alex Jones channel in a few hours, so you can check it out then.
[03:46:16.680 --> 03:46:28.680]  But here is the outer planets.
[03:46:28.680 --> 03:46:38.680]  That tiny light out there is our sun just over a mile away.
[03:46:38.680 --> 03:46:39.680]  So that was Saturn they just showed.
[03:46:39.680 --> 03:46:45.680]  Here's Uranus, Uranus, much bigger orbit.
[03:46:45.680 --> 03:46:51.680]  I mean, these are beautiful time lapses of just how vast our solar system is.
[03:46:51.680 --> 03:47:04.680]  And finally, they're going to end with Neptune, which is way out there, seven miles away from the sun with this scale model.
[03:47:04.680 --> 03:47:08.680]  And that is with the Earth the size of a marble and the sun the size of a two meter balloon.
[03:47:08.680 --> 03:47:13.680]  I mean, that's where we live, people.
[03:47:13.680 --> 03:47:14.680]  And everything works together.
[03:47:14.680 --> 03:47:23.680]  All these planets also have their own gravity that work in conjunction with the sun's gravity and it all has an effect on us somewhere or another.
[03:47:23.680 --> 03:47:29.680]  And that's what we have to realize that we are all on this really small planet living together.
[03:47:29.680 --> 03:47:34.680]  And we may not all get along all the time, but we all have to live here.
[03:47:34.680 --> 03:47:43.680]  And if Muslims have to make room for Christians and Christians have to make room for Muslims, as long as they're respecting each other's space and laws.
[03:47:43.680 --> 03:47:46.680]  And I mean, that's pretty much all I got to say about that.
[03:47:46.680 --> 03:47:54.680]  The final video here is the astronauts who have, they interviewed some of the astronauts who talked, who have seen the Earth from orbit.
[03:47:54.680 --> 03:47:55.680]  And here's what they had to say.
[03:47:55.680 --> 03:48:01.680]  And he also ends with a little term that Alex likes to use, how we're just a small little ball floating in space.
[03:48:01.680 --> 03:48:02.680]  So I really wanted to get that out there.
[03:48:02.680 --> 03:48:04.680]  And here's that last clip.
[03:48:04.680 --> 03:48:16.680]  There are 24 people in the entire history of the human species, billions of people who have actually seen the full circle of the Earth with their own eyes.
[03:48:16.680 --> 03:48:21.680]  Following the breakfast, the astronauts went to the suit room where they donned their space suit.
[03:48:21.680 --> 03:48:24.680]  This is man's attempt to get to the moon.
[03:48:24.680 --> 03:48:26.680]  Zero. We have liftoff.
[03:48:26.680 --> 03:48:29.680]  Liftoff at 751.
[03:48:29.680 --> 03:48:37.680]  In Earth orbit, the horizon is just slightly curved. When you head on out to the moon, the horizon slowly curves around and upon itself.
[03:48:37.680 --> 03:48:42.680]  And all of a sudden, you're looking at something that is very strange, but it is very, very familiar.
[03:48:42.680 --> 03:48:46.680]  Oh my God, look at that picture over there. Wow, that's pretty.
[03:48:46.680 --> 03:48:56.680]  You can put your thumb up, and you can hide the Earth behind your thumb. Everything that you've ever known, all behind your thumb.
[03:48:56.680 --> 03:48:59.680]  Not any bigger than that, way up there.
[03:48:59.680 --> 03:49:06.680]  It's really beautiful. You can cry.
[03:49:06.680 --> 03:49:10.680]  That's what I really wanted to try and capture.
[03:49:10.680 --> 03:49:14.680]  We are on a marble floating in the middle of nothing.
[03:49:14.680 --> 03:49:23.680]  When you sort of come face to face with that, it's staggering.
[03:49:23.680 --> 03:49:34.680]  The picture is staggering, and that's kind of the message, I guess, for the weekend when you're out there and either supporting Trump or supporting the Pope or out there protesting some event.
[03:49:34.680 --> 03:49:38.680]  We all have to remember, we all are living on this planet together.
[03:49:38.680 --> 03:49:42.680]  It's very important to point out government corruption whenever you can. That's how I feel.
[03:49:42.680 --> 03:49:54.680]  The people of Catalonia are actually kind of done with paying for everybody in the rest of the country of Spain, and they want to vote for independence.
[03:49:54.680 --> 03:50:01.680]  When I was in Barcelona, there were Catalonia flags everywhere. Everybody was flying them, and that was one thing people did want to talk about.
[03:50:01.680 --> 03:50:11.680]  Nobody wanted to talk about anything on camera. I think they're afraid of those new Spanish laws where if you speak out, show pictures of police, anything like that, you could get fined or arrested.
[03:50:11.680 --> 03:50:17.680]  Aaron, are you still there, and are you ready to make your comment on the Pope?
[03:50:17.680 --> 03:50:18.680]  Yeah, I'm still here.
[03:50:18.680 --> 03:50:20.680]  All right, go for it.
[03:50:20.680 --> 03:50:27.680]  Yes, the zip code on that real quick is 64079 at Operation Back in our Feet.
[03:50:27.680 --> 03:50:36.680]  But the Pope is just, I'm sitting there watching them on ABC, first on NBC, and they don't have a translator, so I switch over to ABC.
[03:50:36.680 --> 03:50:47.680]  And I just get like this really weird feeling, no matter if it was yesterday when he was with the president or today in New York, or you know, probably in Philadelphia also.
[03:50:47.680 --> 03:50:51.680]  All right, hold on, Aaron. You've got a long-winded explanation. We're going to break. We'll be back.
[03:50:51.680 --> 03:50:54.680]  Liam McAdoo is going to tell us what's going on in the InfoWars Nightly News tonight.
[03:50:54.680 --> 03:50:58.680]  It's the Overdrive Hour. This is Rob Do hosting the Alex Jones Show. Thanks for watching.
[03:50:58.680 --> 03:51:09.680]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all caused by infectious pathogens that often get the upper hand on conventional medical treatments.
[03:51:09.680 --> 03:51:13.680]  Fortunately, a simple, safe, and effective alternative exists.

[03:53:57.680 --> 03:54:12.680]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. and now to 3 p.m. Central, you've got the Alex Jones Show four hours.
[03:54:12.680 --> 03:54:15.680]  So be sure you call your radio station telling you to carry that fourth hour.
[03:54:15.680 --> 03:54:21.680]  And if you want to see us on TV, go to infowarselect.com forward slash money bomb and download that informational packet
[03:54:21.680 --> 03:54:28.680]  and send that to your local station manager and say, get info wars on TV. We've got five hours of shows that we're doing.
[03:54:28.680 --> 03:54:32.680]  The four hour Alex Jones Show, the one hour Nightly News, and we will be adding more in the future.
[03:54:32.680 --> 03:54:37.680]  So join us, get us out there on satellite. We are sending it out into space.
[03:54:37.680 --> 03:54:39.680]  So let's look and see what's going on in info wars right now.
[03:54:39.680 --> 03:54:43.680]  We've got top three articles here on our featured section. Feminist vs. Facts and Logic.
[03:54:43.680 --> 03:54:50.680]  This is going to get ugly. It's a Paul Joseph Watson article and it follows the adventures of the slut walk girl.
[03:54:50.680 --> 03:54:54.680]  What's her name? Lauren Southern. And so that should be some, I have not watched those videos yet.
[03:54:54.680 --> 03:54:56.680]  It just went up a little bit ago.
[03:54:56.680 --> 03:55:06.680]  Ontario moves to ban mother, father on government forms, person, person, EOEA, documents, British government,
[03:55:06.680 --> 03:55:10.680]  spite on everyone's web activity, targeted internet radio listeners.
[03:55:10.680 --> 03:55:13.680]  Ah, of course we knew that was going on.
[03:55:13.680 --> 03:55:18.680]  And joining me now in studios, Leanne McAdoo, talk about what's coming up on the Nightly News.
[03:55:18.680 --> 03:55:20.680]  Leanne, what do you have coming up?
[03:55:20.680 --> 03:55:23.680]  Well, we're definitely going to be speaking about that particular article as well,
[03:55:23.680 --> 03:55:26.680]  because it's not just info wars that's being targeted.
[03:55:26.680 --> 03:55:30.680]  Anyone with a dissenting opinion, and even if you don't have a dissenting opinion,
[03:55:30.680 --> 03:55:38.680]  even if they're going to, they're pre-crime you and see if you are a potential criminal or a potential person
[03:55:38.680 --> 03:55:42.680]  that's going to go out there and protest and mess up this good thing they've got going on.
[03:55:42.680 --> 03:55:46.680]  They don't want anyone messing up their power that they've been able to accumulate.
[03:55:46.680 --> 03:55:53.680]  So obviously the White House's FBI task force investigating info wars is going to be one of our top stories.
[03:55:53.680 --> 03:55:54.680]  Right.
[03:55:54.680 --> 03:55:56.680]  Then we're going to get into this banner, resigning from-
[03:55:56.680 --> 03:56:01.680]  Before you get to that, that video that Alex put together did it all in one take.
[03:56:01.680 --> 03:56:02.680]  Yeah.
[03:56:02.680 --> 03:56:04.680]  Front to back, no stops.
[03:56:04.680 --> 03:56:05.680]  The man's a pro.
[03:56:05.680 --> 03:56:06.680]  He knows how to talk.
[03:56:06.680 --> 03:56:09.680]  And speaking of that, we have James from California who wants to talk on the FBI raid,
[03:56:09.680 --> 03:56:12.680]  and then we'll get to crying game with Boner.
[03:56:12.680 --> 03:56:14.680]  James, how's it going?
[03:56:14.680 --> 03:56:16.680]  Hey, good. How are you guys doing?
[03:56:16.680 --> 03:56:19.680]  I tell you what, yeah, I turned on the computer.
[03:56:19.680 --> 03:56:23.680]  They had been busy working, but saw that article, maybe jumped out of my seat.
[03:56:23.680 --> 03:56:31.680]  First, I want to say, y'all who, for raising that money and going satellite and link up,
[03:56:31.680 --> 03:56:36.680]  I got my butt chewed by my wife and spending too much money buying a bunch of stuff from you guys.
[03:56:36.680 --> 03:56:38.680]  The good thing is you can use the stuff.
[03:56:38.680 --> 03:56:39.680]  Right.
[03:56:39.680 --> 03:56:40.680]  That's great.
[03:56:40.680 --> 03:56:41.680]  Well, some of it was for her.
[03:56:41.680 --> 03:56:44.680]  I got her the brain force.
[03:56:44.680 --> 03:56:47.680]  She's going to call us right now, getting her degree and working.
[03:56:47.680 --> 03:56:49.680]  So I figured she needs the extra.
[03:56:49.680 --> 03:56:51.680]  That's a thoughtful husband.
[03:56:51.680 --> 03:56:54.680]  And I stopped up on the super mail.
[03:56:54.680 --> 03:56:55.680]  That makes me even more wonderful.
[03:56:55.680 --> 03:56:56.680]  Right?
[03:56:56.680 --> 03:56:59.680]  You guys have kids yet?
[03:56:59.680 --> 03:57:00.680]  Yeah.
[03:57:00.680 --> 03:57:01.680]  We do have a five year old.
[03:57:01.680 --> 03:57:04.680]  Actually, you might be getting more kids.
[03:57:04.680 --> 03:57:06.680]  Oh yeah, definitely.
[03:57:06.680 --> 03:57:12.680]  So I live in San Francisco, which is the most corrupt city probably in the country.
[03:57:12.680 --> 03:57:16.680]  But anyways, I saw this article freak me out.
[03:57:16.680 --> 03:57:22.680]  So I'm just wondering if you guys got, not that you need to discuss on the air, but there's a plan to protect you guys.
[03:57:22.680 --> 03:57:25.680]  Because if something went down, it would be really bad.
[03:57:25.680 --> 03:57:27.680]  It would be bad for everybody.
[03:57:27.680 --> 03:57:29.680]  And I think Alex will appreciate that.
[03:57:29.680 --> 03:57:38.680]  But I grew up, I was an athlete, played football my whole life, all through school, put myself through college and there's this drill where you're surrounded by your teammates.
[03:57:38.680 --> 03:57:45.680]  And you're in the middle of this circle and everyone gets a number and they call it a number and they come out and just, you know, whack you one.
[03:57:45.680 --> 03:57:52.680]  And that's how I feel like, you know, being in this info wars that we're just getting attacked from every position, you know, the 12 o'clock.
[03:57:52.680 --> 03:57:53.680]  Exactly.
[03:57:53.680 --> 03:57:54.680]  We have to be ready.
[03:57:54.680 --> 03:57:55.680]  And we are ready.
[03:57:55.680 --> 03:57:57.680]  We do have contingency plans in place.
[03:57:57.680 --> 03:58:00.680]  If anything were to happen, join us tonight, 7 p.m. Central.
[03:58:00.680 --> 03:58:03.680]  Leigh Ann McAdoo, you're going to be talking about Boner, right?
[03:58:03.680 --> 03:58:07.680]  Yeah, more on Boner, resigning for the most powerful position in government.
[03:58:07.680 --> 03:58:08.680]  I'm sure it's because he's...
[03:58:08.680 --> 03:58:10.680]  No, I kid.
[03:58:10.680 --> 03:58:11.680]  Please.
[03:58:11.680 --> 03:58:14.680]  And we'll play that crying game video again.
[03:58:14.680 --> 03:58:16.680]  His crying face is almost as bad as Kim Kardashian.
[03:58:16.680 --> 03:58:18.680]  God, it's disgusting.
[03:58:18.680 --> 03:58:20.680]  That just about wraps it up for today.
[03:58:20.680 --> 03:58:21.680]  I'm your host Rob Dew.
[03:58:21.680 --> 03:58:23.680]  Doing the fourth hour of Overdrive.
