[00:00.000 --> 00:14.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.080 --> 00:23.400]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones all right we've only
[00:23.400 --> 00:30.280]  got him for about 15 minutes very busy and so we're going to come in hot here directly
[00:30.280 --> 00:33.880]  to our first guest of the day I'll tell you about the other guest of news we'll be covering
[00:33.880 --> 00:40.800]  after he leaves us in about 16 minutes he is Congressman Ron Paul here to talk about
[00:40.800 --> 00:48.440]  the economic implosion of the depression that's developing on Main Street as the banks worldwide
[00:48.440 --> 00:54.920]  are setting up a world monetary system congressman thank you for joining us on this 17th day
[00:54.920 --> 01:00.640]  of October right nice to be with you again you've got the floor sir you're the expert
[01:00.640 --> 01:05.640]  on this what are we facing right now well it looks like it's all downhill from now on
[01:05.640 --> 01:11.800]  because what washington is actually wrong they're supposed to allow adjustments to come
[01:11.800 --> 01:15.920]  once they realize they've messed up the economy but instead they're just doing more of the
[01:15.920 --> 01:20.880]  work so an article this morning tells you how desperate they are I was on Reuters and
[01:20.880 --> 01:25.120]  a lot of this stuff is getting in the main street now and talking about how bad these
[01:25.120 --> 01:31.640]  things are but this story said that they the amount that we'll inject here or have promises
[01:31.640 --> 01:37.040]  over five trillion dollars and I was on CNN this morning and I told him I said you know
[01:37.040 --> 01:41.280]  if that could solve the problems I said we would never have to work again just print
[01:41.280 --> 01:45.640]  money but obviously it doesn't solve the problem and you know even if it temporarily
[01:45.640 --> 01:51.800]  helps the market or comes to market or increases the value of the dollar it's all temporary
[01:51.800 --> 01:58.160]  because everything we've done for decades has been inflationary now this is just excessive
[01:58.160 --> 02:04.160]  inflation of the money supply and this is going to be harmful to us we need to go back
[02:04.160 --> 02:08.760]  to work again and that's the part that people don't like they think that the government
[02:08.760 --> 02:14.080]  can take care of it from cradle to grave and that we never have to worry I would say government
[02:14.080 --> 02:18.520]  is going to take care of it but they must ask who's the government there's you know
[02:18.520 --> 02:24.000]  there's a contest going on between us who believe in freedom and hard work and savings
[02:24.000 --> 02:29.400]  and all and those who think that there is a free lunch but I think we're in transition
[02:29.400 --> 02:35.040]  now because our numbers are growing because the people who have for so long believed the
[02:35.040 --> 02:38.280]  government could take care of us starting to realize they can't trust the government
[02:38.280 --> 02:41.920]  so to me it's a bit of an opportunity for us to present our case but it's going to
[02:41.920 --> 02:45.920]  be a tough struggle well you've always talked about when the crisis of the central banking
[02:45.920 --> 02:50.960]  fractional reserve system came to a head and you predicted in Bass Drop Texas four years
[02:50.960 --> 02:56.200]  ago that would happen by 2007 2008 you were right that there would be a contest between
[02:56.200 --> 03:01.920]  those that won an all powerful omnipresent Soviet style state claiming that's the solution
[03:01.920 --> 03:07.160]  more of what they brought us versus true free market and I see the media a lot of the media
[03:07.160 --> 03:11.360]  trying to claim capitalism or free market did this when that's not what it is is it
[03:11.360 --> 03:16.000]  congressman yeah and that's probably the most detrimental thought that's floating around
[03:16.000 --> 03:21.280]  out there but that's what happened in the depression that was the first initial surge
[03:21.280 --> 03:28.480]  toward socialism was they blame the collapse of stock market in 29 the depression on capitalism
[03:28.480 --> 03:33.920]  and the gold standard so that's when we embarked on on welfareism now the same thing is happening
[03:33.920 --> 03:37.760]  again and even you know when you hear the president he keeps saying well I'm a free
[03:37.760 --> 03:43.200]  market person but free market sometimes get in the trouble and we have to bail them out
[03:43.200 --> 03:48.040]  we have to help them but whoever hurt where I keep asking where where did this notion
[03:48.040 --> 03:54.720]  come from that that freedom gets into trouble and you say freedom with socialism and dictatorial
[03:54.720 --> 04:00.040]  powers I don't know why the American people buy into that the people who philosophically
[04:00.040 --> 04:04.680]  are just have their minds twisted is one thing but others you know delight and you know these
[04:04.680 --> 04:08.880]  people who delight in just gaining more power whether it's power of the world the natural
[04:08.880 --> 04:13.760]  resources of the monetary system or our own our own system of government they have no
[04:13.760 --> 04:19.280]  trust in the people they just resent people individually making up their own mind assuming
[04:19.280 --> 04:23.760]  responsibility for themselves thinking that they can do a better job than government and
[04:23.760 --> 04:30.920]  yet we know we too often as a people accept this idea that there is a free lunch but things
[04:30.920 --> 04:35.880]  are changing and yet the opposition are laying their plans as well that's why I fear the
[04:35.880 --> 04:42.680]  fact that they might come up with this idea of a one single world central bank well that's
[04:42.680 --> 04:46.520]  exactly what they're now proposing for decades we've warned people that when this monetary
[04:46.520 --> 04:52.040]  crisis came from their fraudulent crony system that this would happen and that is now being
[04:52.040 --> 04:56.680]  proposed I have scores of mainstream articles the last week where they're calling for globalization
[04:56.680 --> 05:06.200]  and standardization of currencies we'll be right back with Congressman Ron Paul.

[08:08.360 --> 08:14.600]  all right ron paul is our guest for about the seven eight more minutes here today appreciate
[08:14.600 --> 08:21.160]  him joining us congressman in the last seven we're talking about calls for a new global
[08:21.160 --> 08:26.920]  financial order you said they would do that about a month ago they have called for that
[08:26.920 --> 08:30.800]  uh... and in the scores of publications as a headline calls for new global financial
[08:30.800 --> 08:35.400]  order increase uh... we're all still have uh... our currency by name but a private group
[08:35.400 --> 08:40.440]  of bankers uh... will actually set that uh... monetary uh... value they're talking about
[08:40.440 --> 08:45.040]  a global carbon tax being a new fractional uh... bubble where we will buy our carbon
[08:45.040 --> 08:50.600]  taxes from the private banks i mean this is world government of and by the central banks
[08:50.600 --> 08:54.600]  you know that there's no doubt about it and they're doing it through the financial system
[08:54.600 --> 08:59.120]  we call it socialism and it is a form of socialism but it's closer to fascism you know because
[08:59.120 --> 09:03.600]  big business and big government are our partners in this deal so it's a little bit different
[09:03.600 --> 09:09.200]  than the communism and sweetie socialism but i think that this has been going on and as
[09:09.200 --> 09:14.080]  you as you i'm sure agree it has been going on uh... for a long time but well i think
[09:14.080 --> 09:19.560]  what's really happening today is that the we're at the end stages of the monetary system
[09:19.560 --> 09:24.640]  that evolved out of the breakdown of brenton was in nineteen seventy one it's like an amazingly
[09:24.640 --> 09:30.160]  long period of thirty seven years that's that's pretty good for a total fiat currency but
[09:30.160 --> 09:36.320]  it has to be revamped and i uh... they're talking about liquidity crises and uh...
[09:36.320 --> 09:40.920]  tight credit here in this country and around the world but uh... what they're not saying
[09:40.920 --> 09:46.520]  is that the dollar reserve standard is is done for and they're just lining up now see
[09:46.520 --> 09:51.720]  who the most powerful special interests are even though we talk about the special interest
[09:51.720 --> 09:56.840]  and but the powerful influences influential people but i'm sure there's a contest going
[09:56.840 --> 10:02.360]  on there so i'm winning some losing and there are contest uh... between these groups but
[10:02.360 --> 10:06.440]  but they're lining them up and the central banks have talked for a long time to each
[10:06.440 --> 10:12.160]  other is why i'm going to work harder next year although i've had this before is even
[10:12.160 --> 10:16.720]  though we can't get rid of that in a day we need to have more transparency we need an
[10:16.720 --> 10:22.160]  audit of the fed and uh... and the one top secret thing that they have at the fed are
[10:22.160 --> 10:26.960]  uh... the conversations they have uh... with other central bankers of the world if we knew
[10:26.960 --> 10:32.000]  everything the fed was doing and saying everything that president's working group on financial
[10:32.000 --> 10:36.960]  markets was doing and saying we have a lot better insight because i am sure they have
[10:36.960 --> 10:40.680]  been very much involved in the market and they're losing control of it and that's why
[10:40.680 --> 10:44.880]  they have to start a whole new system well that was my next question uh... this week
[10:44.880 --> 10:50.080]  uh... even msnbc's reported secret meetings with paulson and the top ten banking heads
[10:50.080 --> 10:54.440]  where they're handing them hundreds of billions of dollars uh... peace including money the
[10:54.440 --> 10:59.480]  brokerage firm goldman sacks with an inner group of goldman sacks kashkari uh... and
[10:59.480 --> 11:04.720]  of course uh... paulson running and i mean that's beyond conflict of interest and insider
[11:04.720 --> 11:09.000]  uh... trading i mean uh... should congress uh... call for public investigation of that
[11:09.000 --> 11:14.480]  well absolutely and uh... you know you would think that uh... the opposition party if that's
[11:14.480 --> 11:19.120]  what you call it the democrats when the republicans have the pregnancy that they would do that
[11:19.120 --> 11:22.880]  but you know when it comes to a bailout where is polosi when it's come to funding the war
[11:22.880 --> 11:27.440]  where is polosi and her people they're all very supportive of it so whether whether
[11:27.440 --> 11:32.240]  it's uh... working your way into the system and being a secretary treasury for a republican
[11:32.240 --> 11:36.920]  or democrat is the same if you're a speaker that has with your republican democrat you
[11:36.920 --> 11:42.040]  still have to be on the inside so there's really not much of a chance for oversight
[11:42.040 --> 11:47.000]  all we can do is demand it alert the people and try to let the people know exactly what's
[11:47.000 --> 11:50.920]  going on congressman isn't the good news though they were getting thousand one phone calls
[11:50.920 --> 11:56.080]  according to many congressmen in the press uh... and senators uh... against the banker
[11:56.080 --> 12:00.960]  takeover empowerment immunity bill as it should properly be called and and so we can but say
[12:00.960 --> 12:04.440]  the american people don't know what's going on but really they are waking up to this
[12:04.440 --> 12:09.000]  oh yeah showing how you have both parties working for the international banking system
[12:09.000 --> 12:13.200]  and not the people you know it's very encouraging we won that first vote the people spoke out
[12:13.200 --> 12:17.640]  they knew what was going on then the next step was the special interest came in they
[12:17.640 --> 12:22.200]  had the money they twisted the arm and they badgered in with fifty seven uh... individual
[12:22.200 --> 12:27.680]  switch uh... switch their votes but the next step should be if we were with the people
[12:27.680 --> 12:33.000]  really wake up is throw the rascals out especially if you take fifty seven of those guys that
[12:33.000 --> 12:37.600]  switch votes if there was ever a group that should be targeted they should all lose their
[12:37.600 --> 12:41.800]  elections just just for switching their votes and not even defending what they're doing
[12:41.800 --> 12:48.840]  but uh... it's a tough job uh... to win these elections but hopefully we see a lot of
[12:48.840 --> 12:54.320]  incumbents lose both republicans and democrats congressman ron paul briefly uh... studying
[12:54.320 --> 12:59.280]  history of you know being a monetary uh... researcher yourself an award-winning researcher
[12:59.280 --> 13:04.320]  in this what will this hyperinflation most experts in twenty five thirty percent compounded
[13:04.320 --> 13:09.120]  by next year we're about fourteen percent now people on fixed incomes a real depression
[13:09.120 --> 13:14.040]  in the economy with hyperinflation on top of it really never before seen since weimar
[13:14.040 --> 13:17.000]  uh... what is that look like on the street
[13:17.000 --> 13:21.360]  well it's going to be pretty rough and that's why people say that the inner cities could
[13:21.360 --> 13:27.080]  be uh... really in turmoil by that time but it's also the reason our government has uh...
[13:27.080 --> 13:32.040]  probably made these preparations uh... you know with uh... military troops in preparing
[13:32.040 --> 13:39.400]  for emergencies and uh... all the all the ability to undermine every bit of privacy
[13:39.400 --> 13:45.080]  in this country i i i imagine they they know what they're up against uh... but it could
[13:45.080 --> 13:49.960]  be very very bad uh... but if we did the right thing that would have to be bad that's why
[13:49.960 --> 13:55.320]  i think our efforts are either frustrating at times but what else can we do other than
[13:55.320 --> 14:00.280]  alert as many people get as many people prepared the more people who can take care of themselves
[14:00.280 --> 14:05.800]  and be uh... you know self-sustainable uh... the better but ultimately have to win the
[14:05.800 --> 14:11.360]  intellectual fight uh... and convince people that freedom is better than socialism
[14:11.360 --> 14:16.720]  all right congressman two final uh... questions uh... congressman brad sherman came on this
[14:16.720 --> 14:22.520]  show last week and said that they were threatened with physical now glen vex covered it martial
[14:22.520 --> 14:26.920]  law uh... they said martial law will just be declared if congress hasn't passed this
[14:26.920 --> 14:30.720]  he said he couldn't talk about because of rules of the house uh... the different congressman
[14:30.720 --> 14:35.680]  that told him that a can you comment on that in the army talking about using troops through
[14:35.680 --> 14:40.800]  north com against the american people uh... and and and and b did you hear about these
[14:40.800 --> 14:46.440]  threats i didn't hear about it so i can't verify i'm not totally surprised i'm i'm
[14:46.440 --> 14:50.760]  a little bit surprised that they were that much in the open but i don't think many of
[14:50.760 --> 14:55.920]  us would be surprised if they're not preparing for that uh... i mean we see it at times of
[14:55.920 --> 15:00.680]  uh... you know uh... like hurricanes like we saw in new orleans and we feel a little
[15:00.680 --> 15:05.480]  bit about even in my district now coming out of the storm hike you know there's a much
[15:05.480 --> 15:10.840]  authoritarian approaches in some of our areas so no the the atmosphere is set for that and
[15:10.840 --> 15:17.520]  that is a consequence of so much uh... that we've done incorrectly since uh... nine eleven
[15:17.520 --> 15:23.440]  i mean we've given up so much of our our freedom so uh... the the military state is available
[15:23.440 --> 15:28.440]  all there for somebody who can scare the american people enough to say look if you don't if we
[15:28.440 --> 15:32.800]  don't take care of you and have martial law there's gonna be total chaos and it's uh...
[15:32.800 --> 15:37.360]  we do live in very very dangerous times yeah and that will destroy confidence right there
[15:37.360 --> 15:40.920]  of their food riots and then the socialism isn't going to be able to pay for it with
[15:40.920 --> 15:46.600]  worthless dollars final question uh... he's on record uh... barack obama has now come
[15:46.600 --> 15:50.600]  out and i believe they're both horrible just like uh... you know you've stated your your
[15:50.600 --> 15:54.800]  saying vote for uh... the constitution party uh... because both are you know basically
[15:54.800 --> 15:59.240]  uh... uh... collectivist but but barack obama is saying he will declare
[15:59.240 --> 16:02.800]  c o two a toxic waste and you were joking during the break with me said
[16:02.800 --> 16:06.360]  well what are the plans can agree but they're obviously that's a tax on breathing according
[16:06.360 --> 16:08.160]  to the new york times this is the
[16:08.160 --> 16:11.280]  this is the collectivist uh... lead us to dream is it not
[16:11.280 --> 16:16.000]  yeah it it sure is it's just an excuse they've used the environment to socialize this country
[16:16.000 --> 16:22.000]  and scare and terrified people but you know every time we get here we have to go to school
[16:22.000 --> 16:26.640]  where are you going to tell where the c o two is coming from but you know it is not ignore
[16:26.640 --> 16:31.120]  the fact that pollution is bad we shouldn't do it but we don't need the federal government
[16:31.120 --> 16:36.200]  we don't need these regulations if somebody is you know contaminating your breeding space
[16:36.200 --> 16:40.720]  in your air there's a perfectly good way of dealing with that through property rights
[16:40.720 --> 16:44.880]  you should never be able to buy the right to pollute the true pollution shouldn't be
[16:44.880 --> 16:50.940]  up for sale and uh... yet at the same time we get hysterical and worry about this over
[16:50.940 --> 16:54.840]  time now all we're going to do is take a much bigger hole for ourselves

[17:22.120 --> 17:25.360]  of the radio transmission today
[17:25.360 --> 17:27.320]  for those that don't know
[17:27.320 --> 17:31.180]  carbon dioxide is one of the four basic ingredients of life sunlight
[17:31.180 --> 17:33.600]  water carbon dioxide and oxygen
[17:33.600 --> 17:36.340]  if you don't have those you have nothing
[17:36.340 --> 17:40.600]  and this is a total tax on life and on every facet of our civilization
[17:40.600 --> 17:42.760]  and society
[17:42.760 --> 17:46.600]  and i see the uh... religionist that's what they are
[17:46.600 --> 17:50.720]  uh... we're talking about this global utopian society around a carbon tax
[17:50.720 --> 17:54.160]  and the new bureaucrats that are the micromanager lives
[17:54.160 --> 17:57.880]  that certainly isn't the weathering away of the state as it is the ballooning
[17:57.880 --> 17:59.480]  of the state
[17:59.480 --> 18:03.400]  and all the nightmares the cps kidnapping children the
[18:03.400 --> 18:07.320]  so just over the society breaking down the force inoculations
[18:07.320 --> 18:09.080]  it's all about product
[18:09.080 --> 18:10.940]  but the social engineers
[18:10.940 --> 18:13.480]  it's all byproduct of the eugenicist
[18:13.480 --> 18:15.200]  but the theosophic society
[18:15.200 --> 18:17.200]  this is what they push
[18:17.200 --> 18:21.040]  they're with our way that state after they first grow the state
[18:21.040 --> 18:25.560]  and uh... it's all funded by the big elite banks because they are uh... not
[18:25.560 --> 18:27.280]  they cynically know the public
[18:27.280 --> 18:28.960]  wants to hear about a free lunch

[24:14.600 --> 24:17.200]  innocence
[24:18.280 --> 24:22.680]  there must be some kind of way out of here
[24:22.680 --> 24:31.960]  there's an example I was talking to a neighbor out my front yards this
[24:31.960 --> 24:37.680]  morning she said Alex you know I I've seen you a few times on TV heard your
[24:37.680 --> 24:43.280]  show a few times and you know I agree with a lot of what you have to say but
[24:43.280 --> 24:49.800]  I can't believe that something I heard you mention one of the few times I
[24:49.800 --> 24:58.920]  tuned in this happened to me you know my sons and sixth grader he's never even
[24:58.920 --> 25:03.920]  been to the principal's office he's always had you know straight A's and
[25:03.920 --> 25:09.720]  then he's been talking a few times in class and the teacher according to him
[25:09.720 --> 25:14.120]  and me if she said I believe him by the way I've talked to the child he's pretty
[25:14.120 --> 25:20.120]  nice a few times you know out running around the neighborhood a whole bunch
[25:20.120 --> 25:27.520]  of the children in their class are given tickets by the police officer the
[25:27.520 --> 25:31.960]  police officers that are all over the little prison and then she said you
[25:31.960 --> 25:37.360]  know what do I do I guess they're just telling me just pay the ticket and she
[25:37.360 --> 25:41.760]  said but I you know she went further and said but isn't there a judge you know
[25:41.760 --> 25:45.080]  this is a middle-class person I said well of course you have due process and
[25:45.080 --> 25:51.680]  and then you can demand a jury from that judge but she said yeah but but I got the
[25:51.680 --> 25:59.600]  ticket so see that violates due process I mean the law on so many fronts to to
[25:59.600 --> 26:05.320]  give a parent a ticket for something their child did and being disruptive in
[26:05.320 --> 26:10.680]  class talking in class now it's now now notice the state says don't spank your
[26:10.680 --> 26:13.800]  children will see some from you and they're five times more likely to
[26:13.800 --> 26:17.280]  actually physically abuse them in their system but there's no law actually
[26:17.280 --> 26:21.680]  against corporal punishment discipline but they'll still see your children when
[26:21.680 --> 26:25.160]  there is no law like they'll see your children when there is no law to take
[26:25.160 --> 26:36.080]  vaccines it's all color of law see me see how lawless that is and then by the
[26:36.080 --> 26:38.680]  time they to the police station they'll always find something else to charge you
[26:38.680 --> 26:43.040]  with so I had to sit there in the front yard and explain to her for about five
[26:43.040 --> 26:49.440]  minutes that here's the Constitution here's the bill of rights you ever
[26:49.440 --> 26:54.960]  watch Perry Mason you get to challenge your accusers it gets to be brought out
[26:54.960 --> 27:01.480]  is that applicable in the code for talking to charge someone for being
[27:01.480 --> 27:08.360]  disruptive I disorderly conduct no it's a fraud but the state at every level
[27:08.360 --> 27:16.400]  is attempting to force things on the people that are completely and totally
[27:16.400 --> 27:22.120]  tyrannical they prey on the public the system feeds on the public fences around
[27:22.120 --> 27:28.280]  the schools ID cards drug dogs being fresh drug tested now and the government
[27:28.280 --> 27:33.840]  ships the illegal drugs in controls them and then pushes legal dangerous
[27:33.840 --> 27:37.800]  pharmaceuticals whose molecular makeup is in most cases more dangerous than the
[27:37.800 --> 27:42.200]  most deadly narcotics it's a joke I mean that they're bankrupt
[27:42.200 --> 27:48.880]  intellectually morally financially I mean the government is a pack of corrupt
[27:48.880 --> 27:53.440]  criminals that's the bottom line are there some good people in there yes but
[27:53.440 --> 28:01.640]  the system itself is bad is predatory it preys on us so I sat there and explained
[28:01.640 --> 28:05.200]  to her the most rudimentary basics and that's how they're able to prey on
[28:05.200 --> 28:09.640]  people because I know in Houston and I've seen stories all over the country but
[28:09.640 --> 28:16.320]  right here in Texas I remember seeing a story six seven eight years ago this is
[28:16.320 --> 28:23.240]  about eight years ago where if you don't do your homework they quote find the
[28:23.240 --> 28:29.120]  parents well there's no law there the truancy law you know says so many days
[28:29.120 --> 28:35.360]  missed but they misappropriate the law misapply it and say oh well we're gonna
[28:35.360 --> 28:39.800]  say that's truancy and the parents don't know and they get a $500 ticket she
[28:39.800 --> 28:44.120]  got a $500 ticket for her son talking in class
[28:44.800 --> 28:50.240]  instead of being taken to the office and getting some pops or the choice you can
[28:50.240 --> 28:54.360]  take three licks or you can go run around the football stadium till you throw
[28:54.360 --> 28:58.640]  up or up and down the bleachers something good teaches them discipline no
[28:58.640 --> 29:03.680]  we're gonna get you into the criminal system we're gonna find your mother and
[29:03.680 --> 29:07.480]  we're gonna break the law misapplying that that's racketeering in these schools
[29:07.480 --> 29:12.800]  that's what it is an organized group of people engage in fraud and lies in
[29:12.800 --> 29:18.520]  deceit to curse things out of people it's racketeering period lying and saying
[29:18.520 --> 29:25.840]  it's the law you've got to take vaccines is racketeering there is no law we're
[29:25.840 --> 29:29.640]  trying to pass one in New Jersey trying to pass one some in England trying to
[29:29.640 --> 29:33.280]  pass some in Europe Australia trying to pass some in DC but that's you they
[29:33.280 --> 29:37.800]  haven't even when you read those laws it reads like it's the law but you notice
[29:37.800 --> 29:45.160]  it isn't so you have to fight this stuff they don't just get to hand you
[29:45.160 --> 29:50.320]  fines and say there's nothing you can do they're lying they know they're lying
[29:50.320 --> 29:57.200]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[34:33.040 --> 34:37.120]  they'll be at the backyard it's been there for 20 almost 30 years on the
[34:37.120 --> 34:42.560]  Texas Hill Country outside Austin Jesse Ventura is coming in Saturday and the
[34:42.560 --> 34:46.320]  interview with him hanging out with him going out to Willie's World Headquarters
[34:46.320 --> 34:49.240]  and they're doing an interview with the two of them together that should be
[34:49.240 --> 34:55.680]  extremely interesting on 9-11 truth and a lot more than we're gonna have some
[34:55.680 --> 35:01.040]  speeches and stream it live and free over the internet on my servers at
[35:01.040 --> 35:05.920]  info wars.com or prisonplanet.com next not this Sunday but Sunday after next
[35:05.920 --> 35:13.000]  about 8-9 days from now it'll be technical about 9 days from now there's
[35:13.000 --> 35:16.840]  confusion about this I've even told my family repeatedly they don't seem to
[35:16.840 --> 35:22.240]  understand so before I get into the other news and take your calls let me be
[35:22.240 --> 35:25.280]  clear we're gonna now have calls all throughout the next hour plenty of time
[35:25.280 --> 35:30.040]  now to get to Matt who disagrees go ahead a line Alex Jeff another Matt
[35:30.040 --> 35:38.600]  James and others Willie Nelson was on this show a few months ago and a caller
[35:38.600 --> 35:46.240]  called in and said you ought to have a big 9-11 truth concert and a benefit for
[35:46.240 --> 35:51.000]  first responders but then the issue came up of trying to rent a fairgrounds or a
[35:51.000 --> 35:55.080]  big place and then if it's free how do you give money to first responders and
[35:55.080 --> 35:59.640]  then we looked at Willie's works hard I mean he's making two movies right now
[35:59.640 --> 36:05.880]  he's touring about 20 days a month and he's also got some young young children
[36:05.880 --> 36:11.360]  well he's a busy fella what a Renaissance man and so I set up some I set up a
[36:11.360 --> 36:15.080]  date it was gonna be out of Travis County fairgrounds overlooking you look
[36:15.080 --> 36:21.320]  down and see the skyline 50,000 people could have got in and just there weren't
[36:21.320 --> 36:26.440]  the dates this year to get it done he was gonna have to come into town he's
[36:26.440 --> 36:31.840]  playing for a cancer benefit he's playing for a couple other benefits and
[36:31.840 --> 36:38.680]  there just wasn't really the time to do it unless he you know flew in on one day
[36:38.680 --> 36:43.280]  to do it sometime in October so he said look let's just do this and he said in
[36:43.280 --> 36:47.240]  the future we'll do a bigger event Lord knows it'll need to be done
[36:47.240 --> 36:54.680]  anti-war 9-11 truth he said just you and Ventura come and speak at my event
[36:54.680 --> 37:00.520]  the last backyard before they move it to a bigger venue it holds about I don't
[37:00.520 --> 37:05.600]  know seven eight thousand you can cram more than that and but the point is by
[37:05.600 --> 37:10.200]  the time I even knew about this a month and a half ago you know when we switched
[37:10.200 --> 37:16.600]  it his events pretty much all sell out it was already like 98% sold out you
[37:16.600 --> 37:21.360]  know you know because it's not a benefit it's one of his concerts and so we're
[37:21.360 --> 37:26.680]  streaming and out live over the web for free for everybody that's the event now
[37:26.680 --> 37:36.120]  you can get tickets from scalpers out there but I mean that's basically it if
[37:36.120 --> 37:39.200]  you physically want to get there I kind of waited too late to get tickets for
[37:39.200 --> 37:44.360]  family because I mean they're giving me like 10 tickets or passes as Willie's
[37:44.360 --> 37:50.600]  got like 150 gas to me backstage is going to be insane and so I mean I've
[37:50.600 --> 37:57.840]  even bought a few tickets for for well for ten Anderson and his wife I mean
[37:57.840 --> 38:00.480]  it's that packed ladies and gentlemen that I had to buy tickets because I've
[38:00.480 --> 38:04.960]  got a quite a crew I don't even think I have ten it's something like I can have
[38:04.960 --> 38:09.280]  ten people total and maybe even less now because it's so packed and you know the
[38:09.280 --> 38:13.800]  fire marshal and yeah there's supposedly gonna be some other big
[38:13.800 --> 38:18.840]  celebrity guests there so probably speaking out against the whole new
[38:18.840 --> 38:22.440]  world order system I'm gonna leave that alone though I'm not gonna say their
[38:22.440 --> 38:29.320]  names but that is coming up not this Sunday but next Sunday and we're gonna
[38:29.320 --> 38:36.120]  be out there streaming live over the web for everybody at info wars.com it's
[38:36.120 --> 38:40.640]  gonna be free it's gonna be there and it's gonna cost us a lot of money to
[38:40.640 --> 38:44.960]  send it out Willie was offering to pay for us and no I'll pay for it and you
[38:44.960 --> 38:48.920]  know it's just an interesting event so so that's that's basically it I always
[38:48.920 --> 38:52.440]  tell things in too much detail what does it matter I could have simplified that
[38:52.440 --> 38:55.560]  but I have simplified it a few times and talked about it and people to
[38:55.560 --> 38:59.720]  understand so it's simple we announced this big giant event and there just
[38:59.720 --> 39:02.760]  wasn't time to do that because things are scheduled out six months a year in
[39:02.760 --> 39:07.040]  advance farm-aid scheduled out you know a year in advance where they're gonna
[39:07.040 --> 39:10.600]  have what they're gonna do and so we're having this event so there you go
[39:10.600 --> 39:18.040]  ladies and gentlemen I'm just thinking how strange it is growing up never
[39:18.040 --> 39:23.320]  imagining I'd be not just hanging out with Willie Nelson but Jesse Ventura at
[39:23.320 --> 39:26.320]  the same time and talking about government-sponsored terrorism in the
[39:26.320 --> 39:34.320]  New World Order it is truth is truly stranger than fiction and I told you
[39:34.320 --> 39:38.320]  some of the other people they're coming in at now it's pretty interesting but
[39:38.320 --> 39:43.520]  but that doesn't matter really compared to all as interesting as that is we you
[39:43.520 --> 39:46.040]  know we have this global financial meltdown happening we have this New
[39:46.040 --> 39:51.240]  World Order taking over we have the social engineering going into the next
[39:51.240 --> 39:55.040]  phase I mean we face a lot of really serious obstacles but the good news is
[39:55.040 --> 39:58.840]  as more prominent people that have a lot to lose speak up and say really bold
[39:58.840 --> 40:02.800]  things like 9-11's an inside job that both the buildings up whether it's an
[40:02.800 --> 40:07.120]  Italian president or a German defense minister or a best actress this year or
[40:07.120 --> 40:13.640]  Rick Linklater or across the political spectrum that really shows other people
[40:13.640 --> 40:17.400]  courage and allows us to have a mass awakening to government-sponsored terror
[40:17.400 --> 40:23.320]  and then other staged events like the controlled financial implosion that we
[40:23.320 --> 40:28.160]  are witnessing and so it's a gauge it you know it's a gauge by how many
[40:28.160 --> 40:32.480]  prominent people on all spectrum all areas of this political spectrum are now
[40:32.480 --> 40:36.080]  awake to world government and what's happening and then the left-right
[40:36.080 --> 40:40.320]  paradigm is shattering that's why the establishment loves Barack Obama so much
[40:40.320 --> 40:47.640]  and understand I'm not making a judgment I don't dislike Barack Obama or
[40:47.640 --> 40:51.200]  John McCain the pathetic puppets I just know that there are articles and
[40:51.200 --> 40:55.000]  headlines where their mainstream media saying Barack Obama is their Jesus and
[40:55.000 --> 40:58.360]  you know change we can believe in everything's gonna be like heaven now
[40:58.360 --> 41:02.600]  Valhalla and I'm sorry he's bought and paid for by the New World Order he's
[41:02.600 --> 41:06.040]  gonna bring in world taxation world regulation and everything over the
[41:06.040 --> 41:08.880]  private central banks that's what the carbon tax is they propose that they've
[41:08.880 --> 41:12.160]  said it we told you they didn't blow the economy call for world standardization
[41:12.160 --> 41:16.120]  of currency in a global carbon tax and regulators in your house every week
[41:16.120 --> 41:22.160]  controlling every facet of what you do and they're doing it and I'm sorry a
[41:22.160 --> 41:25.480]  lot of you want to get suckered and and and and believe Barack Obama's gonna
[41:25.480 --> 41:28.440]  save you he's not gonna save you John McCain not gonna save you because they
[41:28.440 --> 41:32.280]  don't run anything the only reason Barack Obama matters is that he is able
[41:32.280 --> 41:37.800]  to sucker people when John McCain isn't he's better at suckering people because
[41:37.800 --> 41:43.040]  people look on the surface oh he's his his dad he's a black man and then now
[41:43.040 --> 41:45.480]  there's all these headlines where people are being told and it really is
[41:45.480 --> 41:48.400]  happening well if you're not for Barack Obama you're a racist or you were a
[41:48.400 --> 41:54.680]  John McCain sure you're a racist and so I guess in the future we can only have
[41:54.680 --> 41:59.160]  black presidents because you know if you don't vote for the black man you're
[41:59.160 --> 42:04.720]  racist I mean it's just it's it's it's so mindless but that is a dying dinosaur
[42:04.720 --> 42:11.000]  you know in the polls you've only got about 60% of the country that really
[42:11.000 --> 42:14.520]  even supports one of the two candidates so that gives them each about you know
[42:14.520 --> 42:20.160]  I guess 25 and 35% respectively of the public so you know that they're not
[42:20.160 --> 42:24.480]  suckering everybody and a lot of the left you know they're they're going well
[42:24.480 --> 42:29.760]  he was for wiretapping on warrantless and you know he he voted for you know all
[42:29.760 --> 42:34.560]  these bad things and you know he he said he was against napkin gap but now he
[42:34.560 --> 42:37.560]  says he's for it and I mean if you really look at Barack Obama he's a
[42:37.560 --> 42:43.920]  corporate whore he's not a Muslim terrorist he's not a commie you know
[42:43.920 --> 42:48.880]  that's all in the left-right paradigm that's his foundation cover in the big
[42:48.880 --> 42:53.480]  Chicago corrupt machine politics that's where he made his bones and politics
[42:53.480 --> 42:59.360]  that's where he came from was the controlled left foundation system that's
[42:59.360 --> 43:03.200]  a fact the Annenberg Foundation Rockefeller Foundation I mean he's a
[43:03.200 --> 43:08.520]  front ladies and gentlemen he's a total and complete front of the new world
[43:08.520 --> 43:12.760]  order and you're going to find that out you understand something I never go
[43:12.760 --> 43:18.840]  for what's popular I say what I really believe because who am I if I don't say
[43:18.840 --> 43:23.080]  what I believe and no that's who I am that's what's valuable to me his ideas
[43:23.080 --> 43:28.080]  and information and research that's why I went on air years before 9-11 and
[43:28.080 --> 43:31.160]  talked about government-sponsored terrorism and talked about Oklahoma City
[43:31.160 --> 43:37.720]  being an inside job in 95 96 97 98 99 made a film in 97 that's why in the
[43:37.720 --> 43:40.960]  really the year before 9-11 I said they're gonna stage a big terror attack
[43:40.960 --> 43:47.920]  but I was sure of it by late July of 2001 I'd seen the PNAC documents in
[43:47.920 --> 43:53.680]  introducing bin Laden on the news a lot of people notice that and you know to go
[43:53.680 --> 44:05.920]  on air and in my show had more AM and FM affiliates in late mid and late 2001
[44:05.920 --> 44:13.880]  that it has now it had actually gotten up to over 80 affiliates because I was
[44:13.880 --> 44:17.680]  bashing Bill Clinton I was bashing his new world order agenda I was talking
[44:17.680 --> 44:22.360]  about you know the second amendment and property rights as I always do and so a
[44:22.360 --> 44:28.400]  lot of mom-and-pop stations and any even you know smaller chains you know
[44:28.400 --> 44:31.840]  smaller groups of stations corporate owned were putting me on the air and
[44:31.840 --> 44:38.960]  we're getting good ratings out of it and I went on air and I'm talking about the
[44:38.960 --> 44:43.360]  journey of standing up for you believe in and not compromising I'm not tooting
[44:43.360 --> 44:49.480]  my horn but but I mean I'm explaining who I am and why I do what I do and do I
[44:49.480 --> 44:55.320]  do a perfect job do I put things the best do I make mistakes absolutely but I
[44:55.320 --> 45:00.120]  went on air on 9-11 and we were getting call stations were already dropping us
[45:00.120 --> 45:03.240]  going you know this guy's crazy he's saying call the White House every day
[45:03.240 --> 45:06.160]  they're gonna probably attack the World Trade Center they're gonna set up a
[45:06.160 --> 45:10.760]  police state you know George Bush is you know we know he's not perfect but you
[45:10.760 --> 45:15.480]  know our sponsors don't like it and you know we were losing five six seven eight
[45:15.480 --> 45:20.160]  nine ten affiliates leading up in those few months the 9-11 happened and I went
[45:20.160 --> 45:24.080]  on Derry Brownfield show that day I said it was an inside job and he lost a
[45:24.080 --> 45:27.240]  bunch of affiliates and they let me know they said we can call in every once in a
[45:27.240 --> 45:33.840]  while but you are banned from the show as a guest and Michael Trudeau who in
[45:33.840 --> 45:37.760]  working for Genesis for four years then or three and a half years never told me
[45:37.760 --> 45:41.920]  what to say or what to do he he called me that he was the program director we'll
[45:41.920 --> 45:47.240]  go to your calls in a minute and he said look I'm not telling you what to say but
[45:47.240 --> 45:50.080]  you're not gonna basically have a radio show soon you'll just be on the internet
[45:50.080 --> 45:55.720]  and short shortwave and satellite you're not gonna basically have any affiliates
[45:55.720 --> 45:59.040]  if you keep this up you know this is a bit like two days into 9-11 about
[45:59.040 --> 46:03.000]  September 13th I remember the call getting a few days later he said they're
[46:03.000 --> 46:05.200]  they're calling they're dumping you they're dropping they're saying they
[46:05.200 --> 46:09.040]  don't want to drop you a lot of stations are saying infected an email Brownfield
[46:09.040 --> 46:14.680]  people even said hey look we know Jeff said yeah we know you're you're you're
[46:14.680 --> 46:19.960]  right and it's gonna come out later they're smart but people aren't ready
[46:19.960 --> 46:25.320]  for this and so you're banned then I mentioned that a few years later they
[46:25.320 --> 46:28.120]  didn't like that either but you know what there is a great guy's on the network
[46:28.120 --> 46:31.960]  and we gave him a home you know we should just carry a show but after the other
[46:31.960 --> 46:35.800]  network kicked him out for talking about about Monsanto the poisonous crops the
[46:35.800 --> 46:39.800]  deadly crops you know he got but see how that works dairy you told the truth
[46:39.800 --> 46:43.120]  there too so that's why I respect you and you lost that network you've been a
[46:43.120 --> 46:47.080]  founder of you got pushed out of it but now he's here on Genesis my point is
[46:47.080 --> 46:51.520]  I'm not criticizing him he's a great guy an icon of agriculture reporting and
[46:51.520 --> 46:56.640]  fighting the world war period but here but Trudeau said look do what you want
[46:56.640 --> 47:01.080]  but you know your show was over 80 stations and now it's 50 stations and
[47:01.080 --> 47:07.400]  it's about to be less and when we got driven down to about 20 stations now we
[47:07.400 --> 47:11.520]  built back up to about 65 we gained like four more affiliates the last month I
[47:11.520 --> 47:19.080]  need to cut liners for him I know they've been asking for it and you know I
[47:19.080 --> 47:23.640]  wasn't sad I wasn't upset about that I should look Mike I just got fired a
[47:23.640 --> 47:27.040]  few years ago from the number you know big talk station that we use that you
[47:27.040 --> 47:30.480]  were carrying syndicating on just a Trojan satellite and a few stations at
[47:30.480 --> 47:34.520]  the time and I said I'm I'm you know I'll go back to just being a troll over
[47:34.520 --> 47:38.800]  the internet I mean that's I'm not gonna we're not gonna have any future if we
[47:38.800 --> 47:42.520]  don't expose the fact this was an inside job
[47:43.680 --> 47:51.360]  and you know he on his own show broke from that and said it wasn't an inside
[47:51.360 --> 47:55.800]  job and got upset with the listeners didn't like it he ended up leaving but
[47:55.800 --> 47:59.160]  the point is Ted Anderson stood behind me the entire time and so did Michael to
[47:59.160 --> 48:06.600]  a certain extent and both you know good guys but Ted totally stood behind me and
[48:06.600 --> 48:13.800]  then mentioned hey do whatever you want you know free speech but it's one thing
[48:13.800 --> 48:18.640]  to talk about how you know you're you're not gonna compromise but but you try
[48:18.640 --> 48:25.400]  actually being on 80 something stations and losing losing 40 plus of them 50
[48:25.400 --> 48:29.920]  something of them you I mean you try doing that you try watching them turn
[48:29.920 --> 48:38.600]  you off okay and so that's why when people threaten me you know the they
[48:38.600 --> 48:42.960]  call over email and say have on this guest saying that the Vatican runs
[48:42.960 --> 48:46.600]  everything or we're gonna expose you was working for him and I'm like well if you
[48:46.600 --> 48:50.040]  to ask nice I might have had the person on but now I've looked into them and
[48:50.040 --> 48:53.840]  they're very incredible I'm not saying that the Vatican isn't corrupt doesn't
[48:53.840 --> 48:58.200]  run a bunch of stuff I'm saying you are a terrorist and you're not gonna
[48:58.200 --> 49:05.600]  terrorize me into doing what you want or expose the Scientologists or you're one
[49:05.600 --> 49:09.680]  of them and I'm like well I'm not a Scientologist and I don't particularly
[49:09.680 --> 49:13.960]  like what they do or some of the things they engage in but I'm sure not gonna
[49:13.960 --> 49:21.960]  have to guess you're demanding I have on no you know I'm pigheaded that's why
[49:21.960 --> 49:25.400]  I've probably gotten 500 emails saying well I'm not gonna listen anymore because
[49:25.400 --> 49:32.440]  you were mean to the zeitgeist guy and and you and you and and basically you're
[49:32.440 --> 49:37.440]  a dumb Christian and so we're not gonna let you show anymore you know it's not
[49:37.440 --> 49:42.840]  that I don't care I do care but but but I am who I am and I can't stop telling the
[49:42.840 --> 49:53.520]  truth as I know it and it's it's it's unfair when I'm saying no a bird builds
[49:53.520 --> 49:56.640]  a nest because of instincts ingrained programming and somebody says no they
[49:56.640 --> 50:00.920]  build it because they're taught out and I'm saying well that's just not that they
[50:00.920 --> 50:04.320]  can take eggs away and incubate them and then have the birds hatch out without
[50:04.320 --> 50:07.760]  their parents and they build the same nest it's not true and they're just shut
[50:07.760 --> 50:11.880]  up you're a dumb Christian I'm like it's I'm not talking about that I didn't
[50:11.880 --> 50:18.640]  bring up the whole Christian thing well you're just a religious cook and I'm
[50:18.640 --> 50:22.280]  like no no spiders innately know how to build a web you know they can take him
[50:22.280 --> 50:25.720]  away from their parents there you know they're hatching eggs and and they'll
[50:25.720 --> 50:29.880]  build the same web no you just can't grasp but you're not
[50:29.880 --> 50:34.880]  intellectual I'm like you know that's I get stuck on one point and I'm told I'm
[50:34.880 --> 50:38.120]  wrong about something I know I'm right about and then I go do more research on
[50:38.120 --> 50:43.480]  it and I find out that it's a new age theosophy which is the new world order
[50:43.480 --> 50:51.040]  inter-sanctum religion and then no one responds to that challenge and it says
[50:51.040 --> 50:54.160]  well how is my religion bad but this one's okay and then they say it's not a
[50:54.160 --> 50:56.720]  religion we're gonna come back take your phone calls get into fortune
[50:56.720 --> 51:02.360]  on collisions really key developments there stay with us do you want to pay
[51:02.360 --> 51:06.080]  for the government bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac you may have no choice
[51:06.080 --> 51:11.080]  obviously taxpayers are on the hook for over six trillion that's right trillion
[51:11.080 --> 51:15.600]  dollars in mortgages held by these two corporations the part that most people
[51:15.600 --> 51:19.360]  don't realize is that this bailout can have significant adverse effects on
[51:19.360 --> 51:24.080]  their 401ks and IRAs unless you're planning to help pay for this bailout
[51:24.080 --> 51:28.560]  with your personal retirement funds you need to act now the solution is to fund

[52:25.920 --> 52:31.720]  are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that
[52:31.720 --> 52:36.720]  some Israeli citizens have been detained in Laden's connections to the CIA the

[54:06.640 --> 54:10.640]  They came and took it all away
[54:10.640 --> 54:14.640]  You know the daily Texan here in Austin the student paper is really on fire against the
[54:14.640 --> 54:20.640]  New World Order because we woke up so many of those great young people
[54:20.640 --> 54:26.080]  young adults New Jersey parents protest mandatory flu shots
[54:26.080 --> 54:30.560]  even linked to a YouTube video exposing the New World Order
[54:30.560 --> 54:35.840]  that dovetails of the USA Today story most health workers skip flu shots
[54:35.840 --> 54:39.200]  they'll try to intimidate you and make you take it and even use police dogs to
[54:39.200 --> 54:44.000]  scare children doing it I'm not kidding it's on video but then they won't take it
[54:44.000 --> 54:48.240]  that system's not gonna stand that it's not gonna work you social engineers
[54:48.240 --> 54:52.560]  okay Matt Alex Jeff Matt James I'm gonna take calls and cover some news throughout
[54:52.560 --> 54:55.520]  the next hour but I'm gonna go to your calls right now Matt in Michigan you
[54:55.520 --> 54:57.920]  disagree so you are first out of the box go ahead
[54:57.920 --> 55:04.760]  Hey I doing Alex good I want to first thank you for waking me up I stumbled
[55:04.760 --> 55:09.560]  upon you right last year after I was beaten tasered by the cops here in
[55:09.560 --> 55:13.760]  Michigan but I think I think I disagree about it is kind of the way you
[55:13.760 --> 55:17.840]  conducted your interview with Paul Joseph the other day I really don't think
[55:17.840 --> 55:23.480]  I gave him fair opportunity to kind of state his points now he was reading off
[55:23.480 --> 55:27.400]  a piece of paper most of the time directly out of you know scripts that
[55:27.400 --> 55:31.080]  are in zeitgeist you know my issue was out of the gates he said that a bird
[55:31.080 --> 55:36.520]  builds a nest because its parents teach it how and that's just absolute bull I
[55:36.520 --> 55:41.680]  mean that's a admitted not true again you can take eggs of birds and you can
[55:41.680 --> 55:46.720]  take them away and they will build the exact same nest and I mean I'm just not
[55:46.720 --> 55:50.280]  gonna look look I mean that right there and he took he got this high and mighty
[55:50.280 --> 55:54.320]  attitude and then I'm not gonna put on airs and put a list spawn and you know
[55:54.320 --> 55:58.840]  sit there and go back and forth I mean I know the science I know the facts and
[55:58.840 --> 56:02.320]  then and then the basic counter is well that's just your Christian dogma
[56:02.320 --> 56:06.640]  actually most Christians would probably say that the mommy bird does teach the
[56:06.640 --> 56:11.080]  the baby bird I mean it wasn't even about that it's just you know I brought up
[56:11.080 --> 56:14.280]  about collectivism or anything you know you're you know that's your you know
[56:14.280 --> 56:19.320]  you're just small-minded you know humans differ a lot you know from from
[56:19.320 --> 56:23.400]  birds or other things in nature I think you're not listening to me he said
[56:23.400 --> 56:28.240]  birds are taught how to build nest no no no I understand that I understand I
[56:28.240 --> 56:31.920]  don't agree it's not true I don't I don't agree with him hey listen he's
[56:31.920 --> 56:39.920]  his yogi this Christian a guy you ought to go watch videos of his yogi I know
[56:39.920 --> 56:44.960]  all about yeah I don't agree with him I don't think his system will ever work I
[56:44.960 --> 56:48.720]  know it's impossible for it to work but you know he did bring up a lot of good
[56:48.720 --> 56:52.000]  points like you know as long as we do have a monetary system there's always
[56:52.000 --> 56:55.200]  gonna be corruption and if you know if you want to get away from you know
[56:55.200 --> 56:59.120]  elitism and money in that aspect that you know you'd have to get rid of the
[56:59.120 --> 57:02.200]  money to get rid of that you know but it's never it's never gonna happen you
[57:02.200 --> 57:06.160]  know I understand that but with humans I think it's a lot more a nurture than
[57:06.160 --> 57:09.760]  nature anyway I know we thought you know we do have you know maybe a genetic
[57:09.760 --> 57:13.600]  memory you can call it but yeah it's all about how you're brought up it's all
[57:13.600 --> 57:16.680]  about you know what what's your talk you know and if you can imagine a world
[57:16.680 --> 57:20.840]  where you know everybody was you know brought up not to be violent you know
[57:20.840 --> 57:24.560]  that that that's what I think you know he was bringing up saying well we wouldn't
[57:24.560 --> 57:27.400]  be done well you know if there was no violence there maybe we wouldn't need it
[57:27.400 --> 57:32.600]  you know but you know it's unfeasible I think that uh you know look here's an
[57:32.600 --> 57:38.000]  example sir hold on hold on hold on I said what happens if people don't want
[57:38.000 --> 57:41.400]  to live in this future system he said well you'll be conditioned you'll be
[57:41.400 --> 57:44.600]  reconditioned reeducated so I mentioned that he's talking about
[57:44.600 --> 57:50.040]  reeducation when the zeitgeist acolytes say they don't talk about
[57:50.040 --> 57:54.680]  reeducation in the film I know I'm talking about what he said on the show it's
[57:54.680 --> 58:00.400]  totally intellectually dishonest they will change the debate subjects any time
[58:00.400 --> 58:04.680]  and then jump around and then finally just say look we got giant space alien
[58:04.680 --> 58:10.160]  eggheads we're geniuses you're not and I just blow up when people say look we're
[58:10.160 --> 58:16.360]  just too intellectual for you you just can't understand it you understand
[58:16.360 --> 58:20.720]  bringing somebody back into a new world you know you were frozen for a thousand
[58:20.720 --> 58:23.200]  years and come back you wouldn't know what to do that that's the kind of
[58:23.200 --> 58:27.080]  reeducation he's talking about it show it show it show it show it somebody how
[58:27.080 --> 58:30.640]  the world is now how it's different from you know what I'm gonna give you your
[58:30.640 --> 58:34.880]  say Matt stay there we'll be back in one minute and with everybody else I like

[1:00:05.760 --> 1:00:12.760]  Big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[1:00:12.760 --> 1:00:19.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:00:19.760 --> 1:00:26.480]  Alex Jones okay key news headline New Jersey parents protest mandatory flu
[1:00:26.480 --> 1:00:31.600]  shots but the health workers themselves won't even take it that's some of what's coming up
[1:00:31.600 --> 1:00:38.920]  let's go back to Matt in Michigan well what a can of worms I opened you can't
[1:00:38.920 --> 1:00:44.240]  put that horse back in the barn I kind of just stumbled into the the whole
[1:00:44.240 --> 1:00:51.240]  nest of this but we're talking about zeitgeist continually go ahead sir
[1:00:51.240 --> 1:00:56.920]  yeah I ain't talking about zeitgeist for me it was me it was just more highlight
[1:00:56.920 --> 1:00:59.680]  you know you conduct the interview anybody who listens to you knows knows
[1:00:59.680 --> 1:01:03.880]  that you interrupt quite a bit like aside I don't think you gave him a fair
[1:01:03.880 --> 1:01:08.560]  shot at getting his points across you know trying trying to explain where he
[1:01:08.560 --> 1:01:13.880]  was coming from with some of the points you know with more general generalities
[1:01:13.880 --> 1:01:19.240]  I would sit back for like 10 minutes and then he would start asking me
[1:01:19.240 --> 1:01:25.000]  questions I would say go ahead run and then and then he would just continue to
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:31.680]  make statements that I know are unequivocally on their face wrong now to
[1:01:31.680 --> 1:01:36.400]  a certain extent a lot of stuff that he did say was wrong I just agree with
[1:01:36.400 --> 1:01:40.840]  you know a lot of what here's the deal here's the deal I don't claim it isn't
[1:01:40.840 --> 1:01:46.840]  all about me I am an aggressive loudmouth but I'm also not stupid you
[1:01:46.840 --> 1:01:50.720]  know I mean I'm not bashing folks live up in New York are great people and we've
[1:01:50.720 --> 1:01:54.200]  got a three affiliates up there every time I go up there they think we ride
[1:01:54.200 --> 1:01:58.960]  to work in horses they think we have outhouses here Texas has the fourth
[1:01:58.960 --> 1:02:05.440]  largest city the fifth largest city and the 10th largest city you know NASA is
[1:02:05.440 --> 1:02:09.840]  based here and and and so I think there's some really bad stereotypes like I

[1:03:37.600 --> 1:03:44.440]  Ron Paul earlier he just doesn't give simple solutions that you can put on the
[1:03:44.440 --> 1:03:51.160]  back of a cereal box he tells you to individually awaken and study human
[1:03:51.160 --> 1:04:00.840]  activity from a sociological perspective but again he was born in Texas so

[1:08:26.560 --> 1:08:32.240]  we are back live with your phone calls Alexian Germany you're on the air go
[1:08:32.240 --> 1:08:38.760]  ahead hi Alex hey welcome hey I was just laughing so hard when he did that
[1:08:38.760 --> 1:08:43.640]  voice I mean Peter Joseph he sounds like the computer howl from the movie 2001 a
[1:08:43.640 --> 1:08:51.320]  space Odyssey I'm afraid Dave exactly I'm afraid don't kill me and and he's
[1:08:51.320 --> 1:08:55.520]  knowingly pushing Illuminati communism I mean I've studied the communists my
[1:08:55.520 --> 1:09:00.960]  great-grandfather he was put in a Gula camp and apparently he didn't like the
[1:09:00.960 --> 1:09:05.360]  reconditioning and I've also studied these Illuminati mystery
[1:09:05.360 --> 1:09:11.320]  philosophical groups a few kilometers from where I live is Ingolstadt and no
[1:09:11.320 --> 1:09:17.880]  one said there wouldn't be pain we have to do this for the greater good
[1:09:17.880 --> 1:09:23.320]  exactly and you saw how these different New World Order member groups played
[1:09:23.320 --> 1:09:27.960]  their good cop bad cop routine like the the Vatican for example they said
[1:09:27.960 --> 1:09:33.840]  signs of evil and then came these Adam Weishau guys and they they they went to
[1:09:33.840 --> 1:09:39.160]  these young talent that educated people and said look we are the alternative you
[1:09:39.160 --> 1:09:43.560]  know we're gonna work in secret and eradicate Christianity eradicate
[1:09:43.560 --> 1:09:48.680]  classes and create world peace I mean this is the same garbage and and I mean
[1:09:48.680 --> 1:09:53.400]  it Joseph no I know that's what I'm saying I watched it and all these
[1:09:53.400 --> 1:09:55.720]  9-11 truthers and people that are against the Federal Reserve they're
[1:09:55.720 --> 1:10:00.360]  calling me going what you don't think 9-11's an inside job you you don't
[1:10:00.360 --> 1:10:03.360]  think the Federal Reserve is bad I'm like that that's not what I'm saying and
[1:10:03.360 --> 1:10:07.360]  they want to argue about Christianity and I'm saying forget all that what I'm
[1:10:07.360 --> 1:10:12.940]  saying is this is the inner New World Order doctrine repackage and then it
[1:10:12.940 --> 1:10:17.000]  turns out it's now I've looked at it both films are actually theosophics
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:22.440]  society packages and and again I don't want to spend all day on it because you
[1:10:22.440 --> 1:10:27.280]  know it's only one small part of a larger system it's just it's just I hate
[1:10:27.280 --> 1:10:31.240]  seeing people get fooled you know I hate seeing mothers that think it's the law
[1:10:31.240 --> 1:10:34.520]  they got to shoot their kids up with vaccines full of mercury and they're
[1:10:34.520 --> 1:10:38.280]  just not gonna believe me so you know people didn't believe 9-11 was an
[1:10:38.280 --> 1:10:43.480]  inside job it's gonna take time exactly our second thing I wanted to bring up
[1:10:43.480 --> 1:10:48.160]  is we did an interview with a German law professor and he's the guy who almost
[1:10:48.160 --> 1:10:52.160]  stopped the European Union centralization process in Germany in
[1:10:52.160 --> 1:10:57.080]  Austria and we interviewed him for our little radio program and he agreed with
[1:10:57.080 --> 1:11:01.720]  us on anything we threw at him he knew about the plan for a world government he
[1:11:01.720 --> 1:11:06.480]  heard about the North American Union he knew about staged government terror
[1:11:06.480 --> 1:11:11.320]  threats I mean he knew it all it was amazing this guy's like like 68 years
[1:11:11.320 --> 1:11:18.120]  old and his lawsuits his constitutional lawsuits are responsible for us now
[1:11:18.120 --> 1:11:23.240]  having the chance to the possibility to opt out of the European Union I mean he
[1:11:23.240 --> 1:11:28.320]  put that in there when he sued against that the Maastricht treaty and the the
[1:11:28.320 --> 1:11:31.680]  other treaty that came afterwards well the argument of the establishment is
[1:11:31.680 --> 1:11:35.560]  well world government isn't perfect and it's bad but it's the structure we need
[1:11:35.560 --> 1:11:40.960]  to build the utopia and so it needs to be done and then if you argue with me I'll
[1:11:40.960 --> 1:11:43.800]  just say that you're an intellectual midget and you have no facts and then
[1:11:43.800 --> 1:11:48.400]  to show you a drawing of a spaceship and he explains what a spaceship I mean
[1:11:48.400 --> 1:11:51.280]  that's what the communists would do they would show all the farm workers we're
[1:11:51.280 --> 1:11:54.400]  gonna take you off the farms and take your land and send you into these
[1:11:54.400 --> 1:12:00.520]  communes look a spaceship pitcher oh spaceship oh my gosh a spare it's all
[1:12:00.520 --> 1:12:06.800]  all glistening cities I'm I'm for it I was reminded of the animated
[1:12:06.800 --> 1:12:11.480]  television TV adaptation of the Orwell's animal farm you know where they the pigs
[1:12:11.480 --> 1:12:15.160]  tell the other animals that there's going to be this technology and
[1:12:15.160 --> 1:12:19.360]  everything is going to be fine and so this put this law professor Schacht
[1:12:19.360 --> 1:12:24.280]  schnader he explained that they cannot admit that the European Union is a
[1:12:24.280 --> 1:12:29.720]  superstate because if they would admit that the German Supreme Court the
[1:12:29.720 --> 1:12:34.040]  Bundesverfassungsgericht then would have to say no it's illegal we cannot allow
[1:12:34.040 --> 1:12:38.200]  that so that's why they they don't admit that it's a superstate and they can you
[1:12:38.200 --> 1:12:42.080]  just don't understand what global government is needed I don't understand
[1:12:42.080 --> 1:12:47.840]  you just can't grasp it understand what this is about and this is I mean I've
[1:12:47.840 --> 1:12:51.880]  put up an article without all the quotes I translated the quotes the whole
[1:12:51.880 --> 1:12:56.200]  article is up on the prison planet forums and so I've got to come check that
[1:12:56.200 --> 1:12:59.920]  out and and see what's going on in Englander
[1:12:59.920 --> 1:13:05.080]  does he speak English no I translated everything I wrote an article in
[1:13:05.080 --> 1:13:08.840]  English and put it up on the prison plant forums I translated the quotes the
[1:13:08.840 --> 1:13:12.400]  most important quotes from that radio interview so all theirs everybody can
[1:13:12.400 --> 1:13:19.640]  have a look at it all right good to hear from you Alex in Germany let's go
[1:13:19.640 --> 1:13:26.760]  ahead and talk to Jeff in Texas you're on the air Jeff hey Alex I was calling
[1:13:26.760 --> 1:13:31.360]  to let you know I wasted an hour and a half watching that dendym yesterday I'm
[1:13:31.360 --> 1:13:36.120]  surprised you can even talk being from Texas well that's the interesting oh
[1:13:36.120 --> 1:13:43.080]  you poor thing I'm actually a recovered new-age cult member oh there's no such
[1:13:43.080 --> 1:13:48.480]  thing as religion more fake Christian dogma meanwhile we push the Theosophics
[1:13:48.480 --> 1:13:52.400]  Society which worships Lucifer but that's the only thing that exists
[1:13:52.400 --> 1:13:56.960]  everything else is false you're gonna get me with your pre-programmed knuckle
[1:13:56.960 --> 1:14:03.320]  dragging Christian this oh no no you're not even allowed to comment that's nice
[1:14:03.320 --> 1:14:07.640]  guru but I've actually been there done that and so you know what I'm calling to
[1:14:07.640 --> 1:14:12.600]  tell people is you know I was in the cult I did the little fans is I took the
[1:14:12.600 --> 1:14:17.480]  mind altering substances that move it from the realm of belief to experience
[1:14:17.480 --> 1:14:20.120]  so you know that's how their brainwashing these people as they get
[1:14:20.120 --> 1:14:24.640]  them to experience these altered states of reality with the meditation but the
[1:14:24.640 --> 1:14:32.480]  point that I'd like to make is went to a family gathering called drums across the
[1:14:32.480 --> 1:14:38.680]  world in 94 and you know it was the classic family gathering and when you
[1:14:38.680 --> 1:14:43.880]  left the course the Nazi cops were at the gate and you know I just I looked
[1:14:43.880 --> 1:14:49.480]  around and I realized that this whole concept of this you know Marxist idealism
[1:14:49.480 --> 1:14:53.880]  which is basically what's going around in all of these new-age circles mixed with
[1:14:53.880 --> 1:14:59.240]  the old-age Theosophy what it was impractical as impossible and none of
[1:14:59.240 --> 1:15:04.440]  these kids are learning how to take care of themselves and they claim that they
[1:15:04.440 --> 1:15:09.920]  claim their anti-establishment but the very core of the elite this is their
[1:15:09.920 --> 1:15:15.520]  religion it is their religion all of that's all I'm saying I'm like you
[1:15:15.520 --> 1:15:18.120]  notice he never wanted to get into the New World Order oh they're nothing they're
[1:15:18.120 --> 1:15:20.360]  idiots they don't know what they're doing we're gonna build something better
[1:15:20.360 --> 1:15:24.320]  I'm like no they're building the scientific dictatorship here's the
[1:15:24.320 --> 1:15:30.120]  damage he's doing his solutions at the end were completely completely bunk the
[1:15:30.120 --> 1:15:33.520]  solutions that people need are learn to grow your own food learn to be self
[1:15:33.520 --> 1:15:39.840]  sufficient decentralization but it's not simple it isn't just a one throw a
[1:15:39.840 --> 1:15:44.400]  one-line throwaway line it means a journey of you getting informed and
[1:15:44.400 --> 1:15:48.720]  involved and not just constantly bumping around inside your head you know
[1:15:48.720 --> 1:15:53.480]  you know plumbing your inner depths and speaking to spiritual guides it's about
[1:15:53.480 --> 1:15:57.480]  actually getting out there and doing something and the way that I made it out
[1:15:57.480 --> 1:16:00.880]  of all this new-age cult stuff was you know I was always grounded in the
[1:16:00.880 --> 1:16:06.240]  biblical Jesus and they were kind of pushing the the world Christ at me to
[1:16:06.240 --> 1:16:11.000]  kind of bait me and you know that was all fine and I went into it but when
[1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:14.920]  they started pushing that you know homosexuality and gender neutrality
[1:16:14.920 --> 1:16:18.800]  which is part of the new-age agenda I think there's a lot of guys just like
[1:16:18.800 --> 1:16:22.440]  me they're gonna draw the line right there when they try to tell you that
[1:16:22.440 --> 1:16:26.840]  Jesus was a homosexual it just does not jive with anything that we know well
[1:16:26.840 --> 1:16:29.320]  that's the thing is they change it wherever they want and I'm not here
[1:16:29.320 --> 1:16:33.680]  bashing you know groups and people and I right but listen I appreciate your call
[1:16:33.680 --> 1:16:38.040]  the point I want to move on to I believe John in San Francisco they just told me
[1:16:38.040 --> 1:16:41.640]  this agrees and I'm sorry I didn't put him to the head of the line but yeah great
[1:16:41.640 --> 1:16:48.040]  points Jeff the whole point about that is I don't want heterosexuals or
[1:16:48.040 --> 1:16:53.440]  homosexuals teaching five six seven-year-old children about sex in the
[1:16:53.440 --> 1:16:57.760]  name of sexual education it's not it's indoctrination I want them innocent as
[1:16:57.760 --> 1:17:03.160]  long as possible because that's how they're meant to be in that state they're
[1:17:03.160 --> 1:17:08.800]  not meant to get into sex to leave it puberty and then it's a it's a very
[1:17:08.800 --> 1:17:12.640]  special thing to have children and bring the next generation the world so you
[1:17:12.640 --> 1:17:15.600]  know people need to realize that's a that's a big step in a big decision does
[1:17:15.600 --> 1:17:20.440]  that mean I wasn't wild does that mean I'm up here judging people no I'm just
[1:17:20.440 --> 1:17:26.760]  saying the all this promiscuity is very very destructive okay you know I'm
[1:17:26.760 --> 1:17:30.680]  against wild uncontrolled genetic engineering and laboratories and I'm
[1:17:30.680 --> 1:17:34.040]  saying people need to you know think about reproduction think about what
[1:17:34.040 --> 1:17:38.800]  sex really is I don't know man once you have children you're taking care of and
[1:17:38.800 --> 1:17:42.760]  once you have to people that depend on you it just becomes it just your whole
[1:17:42.760 --> 1:17:48.320]  mindset shifts when you become a parent all that biology kicks in and I think
[1:17:48.320 --> 1:17:52.160]  you get a lot greater understanding at least if you're centered okay John in
[1:17:52.160 --> 1:17:56.480]  San Francisco you're on the air Alex honor to be on the show pleasure to
[1:17:56.480 --> 1:17:59.080]  talk to you good to have you here what's on your mind hey what do you want to talk
[1:17:59.080 --> 1:18:03.040]  about for zeitgeist and money masters I agree disagree with things and both
[1:18:03.040 --> 1:18:06.520]  whatever you want I thought you said you disagree with me so we're putting the
[1:18:06.520 --> 1:18:09.920]  headline okay thanks all right so on the zeitgeist thing you know the the only
[1:18:09.920 --> 1:18:14.120]  issue I had with you yesterday Alex was that you didn't address the most you know
[1:18:14.120 --> 1:18:17.600]  that the thing that he kept arguing about directly which was the scarcity
[1:18:17.600 --> 1:18:22.120]  principle and it somehow they've got some new system that's going to avoid
[1:18:22.120 --> 1:18:27.160]  scarcity well I agree technology is going to avoid a lot of scarcity if it was
[1:18:27.160 --> 1:18:31.200]  allowed to be developed and and and distributed and I'm all for that the
[1:18:31.200 --> 1:18:34.680]  problem is the elite is moving with their own scientific dictatorship to
[1:18:34.680 --> 1:18:39.240]  create a world police state and then reduce the world population before that
[1:18:39.240 --> 1:18:43.720]  step towards the singularity singularity and energy singularity and
[1:18:43.720 --> 1:18:49.280]  computing so so that's my whole point is the word in the middle of a raging
[1:18:49.280 --> 1:18:54.000]  battle right now and then we've got this theosophic original view from which
[1:18:54.000 --> 1:18:57.320]  much of the current architecture comes from and they're claiming the same
[1:18:57.320 --> 1:19:02.960]  theosophic system that they sell the low-level dreamers and then when well
[1:19:02.960 --> 1:19:06.480]  meeting people on I'm saying hey I've seen this before and it's like no you
[1:19:06.480 --> 1:19:12.080]  haven't well you know in the 10 we're not in the transhumanist period yet
[1:19:12.080 --> 1:19:15.560]  we're still human beings we still the scarcity of it going to be here there's
[1:19:15.560 --> 1:19:19.840]  no way around it that's the nature of reality and all he was doing was given
[1:19:19.840 --> 1:19:25.600]  some rehashed you know Marxist utopia nonsense if any of these guys you know
[1:19:25.600 --> 1:19:28.960]  spent two seconds spent reading you know some of the people that you like so
[1:19:28.960 --> 1:19:32.320]  much like the the little rockwells and those guys and the font and the Mises
[1:19:32.320 --> 1:19:36.600]  don't know that you know pricing is a pricing calculations would doom the
[1:19:36.600 --> 1:19:42.280]  the Soviet Russian Marxist Empire and it's an it's an invaluable part of
[1:19:42.280 --> 1:19:47.080]  economics can't get around it well it's also how humans are designed we are
[1:19:47.080 --> 1:19:50.520]  competitive and that can lead to very dangerous things that can also lead to
[1:19:50.520 --> 1:19:53.440]  great things let's keep talking about it on the other side John we'll be right
[1:19:53.440 --> 1:19:56.640]  back I want to get into the economy and for its inoculations you know the
[1:19:56.640 --> 1:20:00.520]  little battles the little pathetic battles I'm fighting

[1:24:05.040 --> 1:24:17.120]  I was a highway man along the coach roads I did ride sword and pistol by my side
[1:24:17.120 --> 1:24:22.960]  many a young man lost her bubbles to my tray
[1:24:22.960 --> 1:24:31.200]  many a soldier shed his life blood on my blade the master tongue me in the
[1:24:31.200 --> 1:24:38.520]  spring of twenty five but I am still alive
[1:24:38.520 --> 1:24:53.920]  I was a sailor I was born upon the tide with the sea I did abide I sailed a
[1:24:53.920 --> 1:25:02.280]  school around the Horn of Mexico I went all off to Pearl and ain't sailing up
[1:25:02.280 --> 1:25:11.720]  below and when the arse broke off they said that I got killed but I'm living
[1:25:11.720 --> 1:25:14.560]  still
[1:25:16.560 --> 1:25:25.240]  I was a damn builder across the river deep and wide we're stealing water
[1:25:25.240 --> 1:25:35.840]  didn't collide a place called Boulder on the wild Colorado I slipped and fell
[1:25:35.840 --> 1:25:43.800]  into the wet concrete below they buried me in that great room that knows no
[1:25:43.800 --> 1:25:59.840]  sound but I'm still around I'll stop torturing people I just love the high
[1:25:59.840 --> 1:26:03.680]  women ballad you really call me that's his favorite song this one right here
[1:26:03.680 --> 1:26:16.120]  I'll fly a star ship across the universe and when I reach the other side I'll
[1:26:16.120 --> 1:26:26.800]  find a place to rest my spirit if I can perhaps I may become a highway man again
[1:26:26.800 --> 1:26:41.080]  or I may simply be a single drop of rain I'll be back again and again and again
[1:26:41.080 --> 1:26:46.560]  all right look I know we got John Scott Helen Nick James Roger I want to get to
[1:26:46.560 --> 1:26:50.760]  all of you Rodney I'm out of control I'm out of control rather be sitting around
[1:26:50.760 --> 1:26:55.680]  listening to music finishing up with John in San Francisco you wanted to make a
[1:26:55.680 --> 1:26:58.720]  point about the money masters yeah well you're gonna sing with Willie when he
[1:26:58.720 --> 1:27:03.640]  comes to Texas I don't think I sing very good go ahead so what a quick one
[1:27:03.640 --> 1:27:08.160]  quick thing to the napiest I have some issues with the first side guys too I
[1:27:08.160 --> 1:27:13.800]  think he just a quick point he mixes his is a Christmas in Easter metaphors you
[1:27:13.800 --> 1:27:18.520]  know he's jammed them all into get in together with the winter solstice just
[1:27:18.520 --> 1:27:22.840]  seems like a mess to me I think you see he's got some real problems but moving
[1:27:22.840 --> 1:27:26.480]  on to the money master guys um you know the one of the things that you seem to
[1:27:26.480 --> 1:27:29.880]  agree with them is that we should move back to script which was the currency
[1:27:29.880 --> 1:27:33.640]  that that we used I guess after the Civil War I'm saying we could have a
[1:27:33.640 --> 1:27:37.120]  debate about government-issued fiat that's controlled with the public
[1:27:37.120 --> 1:27:42.560]  educated and aware or we could look at the von Miesch angle of gold and silver
[1:27:42.560 --> 1:27:47.400]  but any of it can be manipulated because it's the nature of man that we're not
[1:27:47.400 --> 1:27:51.680]  inherently bad but we inherently do have a lot of bad people and then we're
[1:27:51.680 --> 1:27:55.720]  bad and good yeah I mean the thing is anytime you get the you know look the
[1:27:55.720 --> 1:27:59.200]  government is everything implicit and what the government done does is the
[1:27:59.200 --> 1:28:03.560]  is the gun so you know whenever you have the government telling you what to do
[1:28:03.560 --> 1:28:07.680]  forcing you know the money monopoly on you there's always it's always right
[1:28:07.680 --> 1:28:11.360]  with abuse now people should be able to use whatever they want as well I agree
[1:28:11.360 --> 1:28:15.600]  with the guys that we can move away from what we know as current currency and
[1:28:15.600 --> 1:28:19.160]  then there can be all you know computer systems can decide you decide what
[1:28:19.160 --> 1:28:22.920]  system to subscribe to you know to automatically offer you know say
[1:28:22.920 --> 1:28:28.520]  different stocks or different commodities and and and and literally
[1:28:28.520 --> 1:28:32.480]  people could pay out of a stock market but then that could be manipulated too
[1:28:32.480 --> 1:28:36.880]  I mean there's just so many different ways to do it but same we're gonna just
[1:28:36.880 --> 1:28:40.120]  magically get rid of money and exchange chickens and pigs again it's just not
[1:28:40.120 --> 1:28:44.120]  gonna work absolutely but I do I have to say I want to be an amnesia shield by
[1:28:44.120 --> 1:28:48.120]  any stretch of the imagination but but you know I like Ron Paul's proposal his
[1:28:48.120 --> 1:28:52.200]  idea is let's have all you know let's have an alternate currency let people
[1:28:52.200 --> 1:28:56.560]  use whatever they want let's not you know tax I agree but that's hard to
[1:28:56.560 --> 1:28:59.680]  implement it first right now should we be giving trillions of dollars the
[1:28:59.680 --> 1:29:03.160]  private banks and engineered this no we should seize them as criminals that took
[1:29:03.160 --> 1:29:07.600]  control of our government and engineered this and nationalize that bank right now
[1:29:07.600 --> 1:29:11.280]  and then monetize the debt and get rid of it and then we could go to gold or
[1:29:11.280 --> 1:29:15.000]  silver or some other system and have a debate about that absolutely agree and
[1:29:15.000 --> 1:29:18.400]  in fact there's no reason under the sun anybody who doesn't get the Federal
[1:29:18.400 --> 1:29:21.680]  Reserve argument just have to ask themselves a question why do we give
[1:29:21.680 --> 1:29:25.800]  them a monopoly to a semi-private company and then have them charge us
[1:29:25.800 --> 1:29:29.160]  interest for that monopoly I agree back to zeitgeist real quick you know as an
[1:29:29.160 --> 1:29:32.280]  atheist do you get my point that I'm saying wait they're the ones that are
[1:29:32.280 --> 1:29:35.520]  bringing up their own new age religious stuff so if they're gonna claim their
[1:29:35.520 --> 1:29:38.520]  atheist then they can't have their cake and eat it too do you see what I'm saying
[1:29:38.520 --> 1:29:43.240]  you were 100% right on that I mean it's just ridiculous it's not sure yeah hey
[1:29:43.240 --> 1:29:46.320]  listen I appreciate your call we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen stay
[1:29:46.320 --> 1:29:49.200]  with us more call straight ahead
[1:29:50.560 --> 1:29:57.640]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[1:29:57.640 --> 1:30:00.040]  network
[1:30:02.120 --> 1:30:06.240]  had the opportunity to speak to my 90 year old grandmother at some length
[1:30:06.240 --> 1:30:09.200]  here recently and she was talking about the Great Depression we were talking
[1:30:09.200 --> 1:30:13.160]  about the gas prices the food prices this economic uncertainty we're in these
[1:30:13.160 --> 1:30:16.280]  you know really kind of perilous times no one knows where we're headed or where
[1:30:16.280 --> 1:30:19.440]  we might end up and she was reminded of the Great Depression and how in those
[1:30:19.440 --> 1:30:22.880]  days folks who lived in the country did okay because they had chicken and eggs
[1:30:22.880 --> 1:30:25.760]  and they could grow gardens and can their food but how difficult it was for
[1:30:25.760 --> 1:30:28.840]  people who lived in urban areas or in the cities because they didn't have the
[1:30:28.840 --> 1:30:31.840]  landscape for gardening or the know-how they didn't have the chickens in the
[1:30:31.840 --> 1:30:35.320]  livestock so it's a lot different for them well we know one thing's certain
[1:30:35.320 --> 1:30:38.800]  right now we're headed into much higher prices on food and there is a global
[1:30:38.800 --> 1:30:42.440]  food shortage now what can you do to prepare do what I did sell some toys

[1:34:49.040 --> 1:34:55.080]  buddy good hey off and the thing is I just I'm kind of just upset with this
[1:34:55.080 --> 1:35:00.320]  the stock market thing you know going up and down and up and down I I don't want
[1:35:00.320 --> 1:35:03.400]  depression to come on it's not like I want that but I just kind of want to get
[1:35:03.400 --> 1:35:07.360]  it over with and it seems like to just keep prolonging this thing and yet to
[1:35:07.360 --> 1:35:11.520]  be an editable you know the obvious and it just seems like tell me what you
[1:35:11.520 --> 1:35:14.680]  think is happening what you think they're doing or do you think they're
[1:35:14.680 --> 1:35:17.840]  out of control oh I think they're out of control I think they're just
[1:35:17.840 --> 1:35:21.480]  injecting it and I just don't know how long they're gonna keep it up for me
[1:35:21.480 --> 1:35:24.920]  when are they gonna I mean they can keep injecting this and injecting this and
[1:35:24.920 --> 1:35:30.560]  you know until they are they're not gonna stop sir yeah I know that as long as
[1:35:30.560 --> 1:35:35.280]  the dollar has one one hundredth of what it had they will keep printing it and
[1:35:35.280 --> 1:35:39.320]  handing it into themselves and buying real goods with it and then foisting the
[1:35:39.320 --> 1:35:43.480]  debt onto our backs with their paramilitary forces because see by
[1:35:43.480 --> 1:35:47.840]  totally bankrupting us they through the fraudulent receivership system then
[1:35:47.840 --> 1:35:52.160]  claim ownership of us they run up debts in our name take over the world with it
[1:35:52.160 --> 1:35:57.320]  and claim we're popper indentured servitude debtor's prison minions yeah
[1:35:57.320 --> 1:36:03.000]  I know I just but I'm just saying it how I mean the martial law and and and we
[1:36:03.000 --> 1:36:06.400]  know that they're not gonna stop ever they're just gonna continue pumping
[1:36:06.400 --> 1:36:10.400]  every all the liquidity right under them right into their own system so it
[1:36:10.400 --> 1:36:15.080]  fully collapses and they'll remodel ties under a new global government model
[1:36:15.080 --> 1:36:18.980]  openly run by the private banks controlling the UN the armies the
[1:36:18.980 --> 1:36:22.680]  global carbon taxes the local and viral cops total world government through
[1:36:22.680 --> 1:36:28.160]  financial bankruptcy designed by them that's that's it I agree with you I'm
[1:36:28.160 --> 1:36:31.600]  just saying when are they gonna get to that point they are not gonna stop they
[1:36:31.600 --> 1:36:34.480]  are not gonna stay the market's gonna go up and down and up and down but
[1:36:34.480 --> 1:36:39.120]  overall down over the next few years and until it finally craters and then
[1:36:39.120 --> 1:36:42.880]  they'll take the liquidity they've amassed and buy up basically everything
[1:36:42.880 --> 1:36:47.000]  that's left and then it will just be a global corporate state walled off from
[1:36:47.000 --> 1:36:50.520]  the slave populations who wonder why everybody's dying of cancer all around
[1:36:50.520 --> 1:36:54.240]  them that's it I mean just stumbling around cops dying or families dying
[1:36:54.240 --> 1:36:59.080]  still swat teaming us citizens dying diseases everywhere radiation leaks
[1:36:59.080 --> 1:37:04.120]  you know poison death eugenics with the the offices at the UN dancing around in
[1:37:04.120 --> 1:37:06.960]  our graves giggling and smirking while they sit behind the controlled
[1:37:06.960 --> 1:37:11.840]  compounds eating organic food and not taking any of the injections flow death
[1:37:11.840 --> 1:37:14.960]  instead of like another terrorist attack where there'll be lots of those you
[1:37:14.960 --> 1:37:18.720]  know when they need them to hurt us back in you know teach the cops to break our
[1:37:18.720 --> 1:37:23.040]  skulls for safety it'll be a cocktail of it all just social engineering by
[1:37:23.040 --> 1:37:27.240]  control freak psychopaths well I would hope that the what I'm talking about I
[1:37:27.240 --> 1:37:30.520]  wish they would just you know there's something here that can just get the
[1:37:30.520 --> 1:37:34.160]  people so much against them that we could overthrow them but I mean if they do a
[1:37:34.160 --> 1:37:37.080]  slow death like that there's just I don't see anybody with enough people
[1:37:37.080 --> 1:37:41.880]  waking up that way I just it's a guy that's it slow death is on the menu
[1:37:41.880 --> 1:37:48.560]  slow like a slow poison kills you very slowly and you know they drug you out
[1:37:48.560 --> 1:37:52.960]  with the drugs and culture and an entertainment and just you just lay
[1:37:52.960 --> 1:37:57.640]  right there and you just die with a nice propaganda overlay to condition it's
[1:37:57.640 --> 1:38:01.040]  all that it's for our best interest yeah and see when they do a slow death like
[1:38:01.040 --> 1:38:04.880]  that it's hard to wake people up because they just like ah you know they can find
[1:38:04.880 --> 1:38:08.640]  things to a positive anything but when they see it like the banks filling
[1:38:08.640 --> 1:38:11.880]  people start to wake up because they start to see it all over the TV that's right
[1:38:11.880 --> 1:38:15.520]  realize but but when they don't when they don't have enough of that going on it
[1:38:15.520 --> 1:38:18.480]  and they start to mellow out again then I think it would they start getting hope
[1:38:18.480 --> 1:38:21.480]  again and that's what I'm saying if they do a slow death like that it's gonna be
[1:38:21.480 --> 1:38:24.960]  hard to wake people up well exactly when they release a controlled bio weapon
[1:38:24.960 --> 1:38:27.960]  that only kills you know a few hundred thousand people then they'll teach us how
[1:38:27.960 --> 1:38:31.520]  to live in quarantine and lockdown all the movies are teaching us this and how
[1:38:31.520 --> 1:38:34.600]  to be under control and how to have hazmat teams and you know they're the
[1:38:34.600 --> 1:38:38.480]  good guys keeping us safe from it you know it sets up those roles it's all
[1:38:38.480 --> 1:38:42.520]  role-playing in the human mind you know Pavlovian you know mammalian programming
[1:38:42.520 --> 1:38:45.760]  of the you know the government's the good guys they keep us safe from the
[1:38:45.760 --> 1:38:49.120]  terrorists and the bio weapons of the accidental releases or the real or
[1:38:49.120 --> 1:38:52.600]  manufactured and then and then that he teaches us how to go into their control
[1:38:52.600 --> 1:38:56.200]  for the even bigger terror attack biologically that comes later and
[1:38:56.200 --> 1:38:59.440]  then there's all these soft kill weapons going and then they you know they
[1:38:59.440 --> 1:39:03.240]  they practice with the autism they introduce then how to cover it up how
[1:39:03.240 --> 1:39:07.600]  to institutionalize it how to fashion it you know to turn into a fashion where
[1:39:07.600 --> 1:39:11.200]  that where they then again poses the savers with money benefits and giving
[1:39:11.200 --> 1:39:15.440]  false solutions and false reasons and it becomes a campaign issue you know with
[1:39:15.440 --> 1:39:19.440]  McCain and Obama and then there's you know all these other plagues engineered
[1:39:19.440 --> 1:39:24.600]  by them it is eugenics it is slow death and if you want to know what's gonna
[1:39:24.600 --> 1:39:27.800]  happen you know look at the inner cities they're always about five ten years
[1:39:27.800 --> 1:39:32.920]  putting on the sector ahead of everything this is social engineering and
[1:39:32.920 --> 1:39:35.800]  then the people carrying out the engineering at the low level they
[1:39:35.800 --> 1:39:41.240]  don't even know yeah there are products of their environment and how they've
[1:39:41.240 --> 1:39:45.800]  been programmed and and but then by products their environment the enemy
[1:39:45.800 --> 1:39:49.120]  knows how to take the base programming is like humans are like buying a
[1:39:49.120 --> 1:39:53.720]  computer and it has all the innate software and and programs that come
[1:39:53.720 --> 1:39:56.520]  with it but then it's what do you add to the computer what do you build into it
[1:39:56.520 --> 1:40:01.160]  why how do you how do you use those programs and and then that's the that's
[1:40:01.160 --> 1:40:05.520]  the nurture that's what they bring in that's how they punch the buttons yeah
[1:40:05.520 --> 1:40:08.600]  because originally I thought that if they leave it you know did another nine
[1:40:08.600 --> 1:40:12.640]  one one of it that military be breaking out all over the country and then it
[1:40:12.640 --> 1:40:15.920]  would it would change the world as we I mean they are they see that's the
[1:40:15.920 --> 1:40:19.400]  of the game that's the SAV the mental SAV of the government's the good guys
[1:40:19.400 --> 1:40:23.640]  their secret bad guys remember I said seven years ago soon they'll say there's
[1:40:23.640 --> 1:40:28.200]  wide al-qaeda everywhere see first it's just those brown-skinned people over
[1:40:28.200 --> 1:40:30.840]  there you know using the inherent tribalism's not even racism it's
[1:40:30.840 --> 1:40:35.680]  natural not saying it's healthy in this system but it's normal and it's just for
[1:40:35.680 --> 1:40:38.640]  that enemy that wears a turban and dresses different and then the whole
[1:40:38.640 --> 1:40:42.600]  time the battle configuration the attack pattern the system was being geared up
[1:40:42.600 --> 1:40:46.920]  for taking your children arresting you seizing your house the whole attack
[1:40:46.920 --> 1:40:54.560]  pattern was on you see yeah every look at the propaganda you can look at that's
[1:40:54.560 --> 1:40:58.000]  how real intelligence is gathered is what's happening on the ground you can
[1:40:58.000 --> 1:41:01.440]  tell what the secret program is it's how I can predict what their documents are
[1:41:01.440 --> 1:41:04.720]  gonna say before the declassified then it comes out not exactly right because I
[1:41:04.720 --> 1:41:08.280]  can see the physical manifestation of what they're doing in the integrated
[1:41:08.280 --> 1:41:11.360]  fields of propaganda and social engineering and I can see other
[1:41:11.360 --> 1:41:13.960]  countries that are more ahead of us I can watch other countries that are
[1:41:13.960 --> 1:41:19.400]  behind us in in in in in their latest download of the propaganda and so by
[1:41:19.400 --> 1:41:25.080]  studying that as a kind of organic sociologist and historian we're able to
[1:41:25.080 --> 1:41:28.680]  then integrate forward off the enemy's own battle plan until exactly what's
[1:41:28.680 --> 1:41:34.040]  gonna happen yeah I agree with you there outside and the thing is is you know what
[1:41:34.040 --> 1:41:36.920]  I originally thought when they if they hit and go had a big terrorist attack
[1:41:36.920 --> 1:41:40.960]  and they did martial law all across the country if that ever happened I thought
[1:41:40.960 --> 1:41:44.160]  that we'd have a chance to regroup at that point everybody say I can't stand
[1:41:44.160 --> 1:41:47.520]  the military on the streets and they would realize and they're gonna have
[1:41:47.520 --> 1:41:52.120]  rioting and then people starving and more disasters to introduce us just
[1:41:52.120 --> 1:41:56.320]  incrementally okay see they're gonna have north come out with the jaws of life
[1:41:56.320 --> 1:42:00.200]  you know that big machine that cuts crushed cars open I mean that they say
[1:42:00.200 --> 1:42:03.800]  that for PR oh we're here to help local police we're just here oh we're here to
[1:42:03.800 --> 1:42:07.480]  well like local police couldn't have the jaws of life you know but no no the
[1:42:07.480 --> 1:42:11.640]  military see lots of PR pieces you already see it I mean I remember nine
[1:42:11.640 --> 1:42:15.280]  years ago oh that the military police from the Army in the Air Force and San
[1:42:15.280 --> 1:42:20.360]  Antonio are out in downtown this week for Fiesta helping with security and it
[1:42:20.360 --> 1:42:24.360]  showed them arresting someone see it's just introduced oh they're at the
[1:42:24.360 --> 1:42:28.960]  Kentucky Derby oh they're at the MTV Awards oh they're at the NFL Super Bowl
[1:42:28.960 --> 1:42:33.160]  oh they're at my school oh they did a terror drill at my school they didn't
[1:42:33.160 --> 1:42:37.240]  announce it and some kids crap their pants but you know the parents call the
[1:42:37.240 --> 1:42:40.120]  news they picked the one parent that likes it you know it kind of scared
[1:42:40.120 --> 1:42:44.440]  them but with Al Qaeda I kind of think it's needed meanwhile your children have
[1:42:44.440 --> 1:42:48.400]  now been trained to basically submit into a catatonic state when men run in on
[1:42:48.400 --> 1:42:52.160]  a swatting formation it's all that the whole country the whole world's a giant
[1:42:52.160 --> 1:42:58.840]  reeducation camp that's exactly right yeah we need a reeducation don't we
[1:42:58.840 --> 1:43:03.920]  god I hate to float that does it I mean that day I guess there's that's the death
[1:43:03.920 --> 1:43:11.560]  creeping death yeah creeping soul-sucking death yeah that's the
[1:43:11.560 --> 1:43:16.640]  worst kind man she take care my friend all we can do is face the horror and
[1:43:16.640 --> 1:43:20.040]  make preparation for it I mean people say oh it's negative it's fear-mongering
[1:43:20.040 --> 1:43:23.960]  it's scary I mean what is it one in 33 with cancer now one and two with males
[1:43:23.960 --> 1:43:28.520]  one and three with women what is it one in 25 27 years ago with autism now one
[1:43:28.520 --> 1:43:34.520]  in 86 what is it what is sodium deadly fluoride other toxins in the water by
[1:43:34.520 --> 1:43:37.760]  design with government documents to brain damage you and and cause
[1:43:37.760 --> 1:43:41.680]  calcification of all your major glands and bone fractures I mean you may not as
[1:43:41.680 --> 1:43:47.080]  adults care about yourself adults innately have a self-sacrifice programming
[1:43:47.080 --> 1:43:51.560]  once you get into the hierarchy of needs but the enemy reprograms that and
[1:43:51.560 --> 1:43:55.320]  uses it against you where you don't care about yourself well you better go
[1:43:55.320 --> 1:43:59.720]  ahead and care about your children look at their little eyes look at their little
[1:43:59.720 --> 1:44:07.840]  faces you know I try to tell young people on air and and personally when I
[1:44:07.840 --> 1:44:10.160]  hear that young men and women are getting in trouble in school I tell them
[1:44:10.160 --> 1:44:14.120]  look if you notice that MTV and TV and the culture in the movie show it is cool
[1:44:14.120 --> 1:44:19.840]  to rebel and cool to do bad things and then they show you how you're supposed
[1:44:19.840 --> 1:44:26.120]  to rebel with your hair your clothes or with tattoos or how you talk and I'm
[1:44:26.120 --> 1:44:30.120]  not seeing any of that's a bad thing I don't it doesn't matter to me I'm seeing
[1:44:30.120 --> 1:44:34.560]  how the enemy operates and then what they simultaneously tell you is cool to
[1:44:34.560 --> 1:44:38.600]  wear and how to talk they show police and say this is the enemy this is who you
[1:44:38.600 --> 1:44:46.320]  alert on so see you get into camouflage which is a polo shirt slacks nice
[1:44:46.320 --> 1:44:51.440]  shoes you act friendly is smile you understand you're defeating enemy
[1:44:51.440 --> 1:44:57.280]  operations you go in that class and you act friendly and you smile and you know
[1:44:57.280 --> 1:45:00.240]  all the young boys have been taught to act like gangbangers and you know behave
[1:45:00.240 --> 1:45:05.680]  like you know basically recess monkeys and so they act like that then wonder
[1:45:05.680 --> 1:45:09.200]  why they really don't get the women see they know mammalian programming and
[1:45:09.200 --> 1:45:11.600]  there's thousands of different points of it but that's one of the key ones and
[1:45:11.600 --> 1:45:15.160]  they teach girls act like a little whore and then you'll get all the guys then
[1:45:15.160 --> 1:45:21.160]  really destroys their life it makes them unhappy and they get used up and get into
[1:45:21.160 --> 1:45:25.400]  drugs and the rest of it you know I mean you know oh you're too old to you know
[1:45:25.400 --> 1:45:28.760]  old drugs that's too cool that's in the movies or you're too young or you know
[1:45:28.760 --> 1:45:32.480]  that's bad don't use that no you tell them no that's just a really dangerous
[1:45:32.480 --> 1:45:35.240]  stuff brought in by the government because they want to be able to catch you
[1:45:35.240 --> 1:45:43.120]  with it to put you in their prisons and by the way the drug dealers cut it at the
[1:45:43.120 --> 1:45:48.280]  low level of all sorts of poison so don't ever take methamphetamine because it
[1:45:48.280 --> 1:45:53.680]  will kill all your T lymphocytes and will and we'll give you leukemia it'll
[1:45:53.680 --> 1:45:58.520]  kill you real fast because again the government made all the base ingredients
[1:45:58.520 --> 1:46:01.680]  illegal to make it so people instead of having three or four ingredients to make
[1:46:01.680 --> 1:46:04.960]  clean methamphetamine which is still bad cause you're not asleep destroys your
[1:46:04.960 --> 1:46:09.320]  nervous system over time like Elvis it'll kill you a hundred times literally
[1:46:09.320 --> 1:46:16.520]  faster because they have to take each subgrouping of the drug eat each sub
[1:46:16.520 --> 1:46:21.960]  ingredient and maybe take five 10 15 20 different things to just get the base
[1:46:21.960 --> 1:46:25.280]  ingredients they need and they don't properly because they're not chemist and
[1:46:25.280 --> 1:46:28.440]  not the chemist can even do it properly it's very take a huge factory to do it
[1:46:28.440 --> 1:46:32.160]  properly with all those chemicals you know to make the methamphetamine so
[1:46:32.160 --> 1:46:35.920]  they're separating out all these deadly poisons in there in a bathtub while you
[1:46:35.920 --> 1:46:39.360]  know all the babies sitting there sucking on a baggie full of methamphetamine
[1:46:39.360 --> 1:46:42.080]  having a heart attack
[1:46:43.240 --> 1:46:46.880]  and globalists know that they introduce a drug culture they know it's a doorway
[1:46:46.880 --> 1:46:50.520]  it's president it's cold-blooded it's to create internal division warfare
[1:46:50.520 --> 1:46:55.680]  sectarian violence black markets to corrupt police this is sociology this is
[1:46:55.680 --> 1:47:01.520]  hardcore these people are hardcore they they literally have 170 IQs and they're
[1:47:01.520 --> 1:47:07.520]  evil they're wicked they're cold-blooded they're selfish and they're not going to
[1:47:07.520 --> 1:47:14.240]  give us any quarter do not ever use meth amphetamine you're out having fun

[1:47:40.600 --> 1:47:44.360]  people but b it's being used to totally shut down the system and destroy the
[1:47:44.360 --> 1:47:51.080]  bill of rights and then parents know teenagers you know in the 12th grader
[1:47:51.080 --> 1:47:53.680]  gonna drink so they try to leave and let them have a party at the house and they
[1:47:53.680 --> 1:47:58.360]  get arrested and CPS you know the other's no into it the point is is that

[1:48:05.640 --> 1:48:07.920]  popular and cool and really mean something at school you want to do
[1:48:07.920 --> 1:48:12.040]  something really different you want to be a real rebel go hand out 500 copies
[1:48:12.040 --> 1:48:16.760]  at your high school of a fact sheet that there's no law to take vaccines and
[1:48:16.760 --> 1:48:20.680]  that they're dangerous and then they're gonna haul you into the principal's
[1:48:20.680 --> 1:48:24.040]  office and they're gonna tell you they're gonna have you arrested and you just
[1:48:24.040 --> 1:48:27.520]  sit there and you act friendly with a voice recorder in your pocket and then
[1:48:27.520 --> 1:48:30.480]  you go out and you put that on YouTube and it's gonna be national news and
[1:48:30.480 --> 1:48:35.520]  people are gonna go jail they're gonna get fired you want to really be a rebel
[1:48:35.520 --> 1:48:39.040]  defend the Republic defend humanity be a true warrior you're already supposed to
[1:48:39.040 --> 1:48:46.000]  be a warrior 12 or 13 men women both of you you want to really change things set
[1:48:46.000 --> 1:48:50.280]  these bastards up bring them down show their racketeering show their
[1:48:50.280 --> 1:48:58.080]  criminality we will invade their system we will expose it at every level and we
[1:48:58.080 --> 1:49:06.000]  will never stop don't ever use any of their drugs don't use any of them not
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:09.920]  their prozac not their red one not their valium not their heroin not their
[1:49:09.920 --> 1:49:15.720]  cocaine I mean obviously substance use is part of human history and part of
[1:49:15.720 --> 1:49:21.880]  what we do you can watch a blue jay sit out and eat ripe china berries that have
[1:49:21.880 --> 1:49:27.400]  alcohol in them and get drunk and fall on the ground it's funny you know as you
[1:49:27.400 --> 1:49:29.960]  get older if you know how to do something in moderation I don't think
[1:49:29.960 --> 1:49:33.160]  marijuana and a little bit of alcohol overall is a bad thing the problem is
[1:49:33.160 --> 1:49:40.680]  it generally is very dangerous and leads into excess and so that's why I don't
[1:49:40.680 --> 1:49:48.160]  smoke marijuana a ever and I try to not drink because for me alcohol is not a
[1:49:48.160 --> 1:49:55.040]  good thing there are plenty of people who can drink you know one glass of wine
[1:49:55.040 --> 1:50:00.440]  every night with their meal that is really good for you or one beer every
[1:50:00.440 --> 1:50:07.800]  study shows it's good me I I don't drink one beer I don't drink a lot I mean last
[1:50:07.800 --> 1:50:11.760]  night I just couldn't help myself about a six pack of drink to the bears and then
[1:50:11.760 --> 1:50:14.440]  it I got made me hyper that that's actually why I like to drink because a
[1:50:14.440 --> 1:50:18.440]  few beers will have a stimulus effect and then I was up at 1 a.m. and I knew how
[1:50:18.440 --> 1:50:21.080]  to get up at 6 a.m. and I'm like I can't go sleep because I like those beers at
[1:50:21.080 --> 1:50:24.640]  9 a.m. I mean 9 p.m.
[1:50:24.640 --> 1:50:31.480]  oh it doesn't matter the point is is that govern myself you know get control of
[1:50:31.480 --> 1:50:34.320]  your mind think about how you're operating think about what you're doing
[1:50:34.320 --> 1:50:39.160]  and for heaven's sakes don't come to your children and tell them they can't watch
[1:50:39.160 --> 1:50:42.120]  violent TV because it's too adult for them they want to be go they want to be
[1:50:42.120 --> 1:50:45.800]  elders teach them that it's dangerous in programs their mind and damages their
[1:50:45.800 --> 1:50:49.800]  mind you know that you know that you know don't tell them they can't go out and
[1:50:49.800 --> 1:50:53.720]  party with their friends because you know they're too young explain to them
[1:50:53.720 --> 1:50:57.240]  that this is a predatory system with criminal forces wanting to put them in

[1:54:00.120 --> 1:54:14.120]  Federal agents we are armed! As much as I love the man in Paris we're going to cut this music off here in a second and go to Helen in the great country of Canada.
[1:54:14.120 --> 1:54:22.280]  Hello Alex. Hello Helen. How are you? Good. I just wanted to say that I really know that
[1:54:22.280 --> 1:54:26.360]  your life purpose is what you're doing now you just love it I love your
[1:54:26.360 --> 1:54:32.320]  spontaneity I love your passion and naturally I love your your truth and
[1:54:32.320 --> 1:54:37.080]  for us to discover if we quit want to question something. To me I listen to
[1:54:37.080 --> 1:54:43.400]  you because it it gives me I might as well not have finished you know my
[1:54:43.400 --> 1:54:47.800]  university because I get more university from you and more thinking than
[1:54:47.800 --> 1:54:52.520]  any of my degrees or letters after my name. Well I'm flattered by that and I
[1:54:52.520 --> 1:54:55.960]  get more from the listeners than I really get anywhere else all the great
[1:54:55.960 --> 1:55:01.240]  angles and issues you bring up in the guess we have. Thank you. You're
[1:55:01.240 --> 1:55:07.640]  relatively you know I've was asked to listen to your station and relatively
[1:55:07.640 --> 1:55:13.400]  maybe three or four months ago and I intuitively I came home and listened to
[1:55:13.400 --> 1:55:18.880]  it immediately and I was hooked on and you're you're dead on in regard to the
[1:55:18.880 --> 1:55:27.360]  world order you're dead on in regard to finance in my opinion we shouldn't
[1:55:27.360 --> 1:55:35.280]  give those robbers one red cent they've sucked us dry and basically they're so
[1:55:35.280 --> 1:55:40.080]  evil that they don't I mean that don't have much hope we have to develop
[1:55:40.080 --> 1:55:48.120]  ourselves within to be so strong to fight them and and and that we cannot be in
[1:55:48.120 --> 1:55:55.440]  fear and unfortunately I was given a real gift my passion was teaching as
[1:55:55.440 --> 1:56:01.200]  well but in my 15 years of teaching only one principle recognized my talent
[1:56:01.200 --> 1:56:08.760]  before I went to school up until age seven I had a model that that modeled
[1:56:08.760 --> 1:56:13.320]  love modeled caring compassion everything to develop consciousness and
[1:56:13.320 --> 1:56:19.360]  awareness and as I went to school I could see that I was shamed and I was
[1:56:19.360 --> 1:56:25.320]  put down and I was very confused and didn't know why I was a poor you know
[1:56:25.320 --> 1:56:29.400]  it's a very very sick system and most schools bring you into the sickness of
[1:56:29.400 --> 1:56:33.120]  the modern culture and it destroys the innocence people think of innocence as
[1:56:33.120 --> 1:56:38.160]  somebody who who hasn't experienced things in a way I don't know how to
[1:56:38.160 --> 1:56:42.840]  describe it innocence is more our natural self and their much children who are
[1:56:42.840 --> 1:56:46.680]  innocent are much more attuned they're so innately intelligence it's just
[1:56:46.680 --> 1:56:51.880]  magical oh it's absolutely magical when I was five years old I look looked up
[1:56:51.880 --> 1:56:57.160]  on it happened to the heavens and one day the heavens said to me which I God
[1:56:57.160 --> 1:57:01.840]  higher power whatever you want to call it and my terms today are very neutral I
[1:57:01.840 --> 1:57:06.880]  mean it didn't it doesn't matter I mean we get caught up in terms and that's
[1:57:06.880 --> 1:57:11.120]  why I'm what I was going to call you in regard to like us as a disease and we
[1:57:11.120 --> 1:57:14.000]  got about a minute and a half left so go ahead make your point I look up into the
[1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:18.520]  heavens and it said one day you are going to understand everything and I put
[1:57:18.520 --> 1:57:21.720]  my hand up I said oh no don't give me that that's too much for little girl my
[1:57:21.720 --> 1:57:27.640]  age and I kept off so that modeled my innocence but it modeled my consciousness
[1:57:27.640 --> 1:57:32.120]  and my knowing I remember having I think most children have those similar
[1:57:32.120 --> 1:57:37.400]  similar events you know staring into the great void of the universe you know
[1:57:37.400 --> 1:57:41.200]  realizing that this is so much more around us that we're just a tiny island
[1:57:41.200 --> 1:57:46.360]  you know in the middle of it with the you know sea of experiences and events
[1:57:46.360 --> 1:57:50.920]  and other individuals and consciousness around us it's it's it's just so so
[1:57:50.920 --> 1:57:55.400]  wonderful life is truly wonderful and there's a lot of pain and a lot of bad
[1:57:55.400 --> 1:58:00.120]  things in the midst of it but a lot of people do get hurt by the system and
[1:58:00.120 --> 1:58:04.840]  that's why a lot of people do turn to evil they learned to revel in it and
[1:58:04.840 --> 1:58:10.080]  you know it's it's it's all a process and that's why we need God listen I
[1:58:10.080 --> 1:58:13.360]  appreciate your call it's good hearing from you good to have you fitting into
[1:58:13.360 --> 1:58:17.160]  the show Helen from Canada I'm talking Nick James Rodney Russ and others

[1:58:32.040 --> 1:58:36.640]  attend school but there's no law to take it to attend school they just say it's
[1:58:36.640 --> 1:58:40.720]  a regulation so it's it's fraud

[2:00:28.440 --> 2:00:35.240]  Nick in Indiana you're on the air sir hey how you doing good all right I
[2:00:35.240 --> 2:00:41.160]  originally came aware of you back in the day when waking life came out back in
[2:00:41.160 --> 2:00:46.760]  I don't know 2001 2002 and I've been it's probably been later than that but I have
[2:00:46.760 --> 2:00:53.760]  been a fan ever since in-game great terror storm great but what I wanted to
[2:00:53.760 --> 2:00:59.400]  call about I guess is not necessarily anything I disagree with you but sort of
[2:00:59.400 --> 2:01:04.640]  a I guess sort of a cautionary note maybe first some of your well of course
[2:01:04.640 --> 2:01:09.320]  I'm a jackass of course I'm arrogant and and have all I mean of course I've
[2:01:09.320 --> 2:01:12.720]  probably done a better job in that zeitgeist interview but it's as soon as
[2:01:12.720 --> 2:01:16.520]  he told me that birds are taught how to build nest and then and then just took
[2:01:16.520 --> 2:01:21.160]  on that hoity-toity attitude no I told me that makes me mad and then the whole
[2:01:21.160 --> 2:01:26.160]  thing is the theosophic society of its word-for-word out of it and I just I'm
[2:01:26.160 --> 2:01:30.520]  sorry you know I told I know I agree with you I don't believe in the
[2:01:30.520 --> 2:01:35.280]  conditioning thing I you know what happened with the first human did they
[2:01:35.280 --> 2:01:39.280]  have to be conditioned by something else and yada yada yada it just doesn't
[2:01:39.280 --> 2:01:46.880]  follow my thing is is what I called about was sort of I guess what we term
[2:01:46.880 --> 2:01:54.680]  occult there definitely is a lot of negative connotation with the term
[2:01:54.680 --> 2:02:00.840]  occult and occult just means hidden as you know definitely hidden but with
[2:02:00.840 --> 2:02:07.400]  occult practices as far as how people use the occult for different spiritual
[2:02:07.400 --> 2:02:12.360]  paths and well Rob Jacobson puts it well any group that's secret any group that
[2:02:12.360 --> 2:02:15.640]  tells you it's esoteric and can't let you know the higher secrets throughout
[2:02:15.640 --> 2:02:19.440]  history when you get down to the bottom line it's Lucifer they're worshipping
[2:02:19.440 --> 2:02:23.480]  and I mean that's what all these major groups at the end of the day they say
[2:02:23.480 --> 2:02:27.000]  hey Lucifer is our guy we just can't tell the low-level people they're not
[2:02:27.000 --> 2:02:32.080]  ready for it definitely and I totally understand that but there are definitely
[2:02:32.080 --> 2:02:36.320]  many people out there and these might be the low-level people you're talking
[2:02:36.320 --> 2:02:41.520]  about you know the upper echelons may definitely have their own agenda but
[2:02:41.520 --> 2:02:46.760]  there are plenty of good intending people out there that are occult
[2:02:46.760 --> 2:02:52.520]  practitioners that use things such as ritual and look most these Christian
[2:02:52.520 --> 2:02:57.000]  denominations are the same thing I'm not arguing with you I'm not arguing with
[2:02:57.000 --> 2:03:00.840]  you I mean I'm not saying that I'm not here even judging people this isn't
[2:03:00.840 --> 2:03:03.720]  really a religious show that that's what I kept saying in the argument he kept
[2:03:03.720 --> 2:03:06.240]  saying that's your Christian perspective and I said hey get get that out
[2:03:06.240 --> 2:03:10.880]  of the way man I'm here talking about birds building nests from instinct I'm
[2:03:10.880 --> 2:03:14.520]  talking about science you're not and the whole things of theosophics society
[2:03:14.520 --> 2:03:19.800]  angle and then they're busy saying we're we're we're dumb religionist meanwhile
[2:03:19.800 --> 2:03:23.240]  they're they're the ones being religious don't you see what I'm saying no I
[2:03:23.240 --> 2:03:29.000]  totally I told you and I appreciate that you are tolerant of other people's
[2:03:29.000 --> 2:03:33.040]  beliefs and even when it comes down to that even when it comes down to those
[2:03:33.040 --> 2:03:39.480]  who worship Lucifer or whatever there's many different ways you can take that
[2:03:39.480 --> 2:03:47.800]  it's about people having spiritual beliefs and as long and this is why I'm
[2:03:47.800 --> 2:03:52.320]  saying cautionary for your listeners as long as someone is not hurting somebody
[2:03:52.320 --> 2:03:55.840]  else you should be able to believe in whatever you want and I'm not saying
[2:03:55.840 --> 2:04:00.400]  you've ever said anything to the contrary I'm saying that just because
[2:04:00.400 --> 2:04:04.280]  you're an occult practitioner doesn't necessarily mean you're an inherently
[2:04:04.280 --> 2:04:08.480]  evil person and I don't want your listeners to think that they hear that
[2:04:08.480 --> 2:04:12.280]  someone is involved in a particular organization well here's the deal I mean
[2:04:12.280 --> 2:04:16.040]  according to a Muslim everybody else is basically an occult practitioner and
[2:04:16.040 --> 2:04:19.880]  according to a Christian everybody else is an occult practitioner you know it
[2:04:19.880 --> 2:04:23.880]  everything separate from it is in a you know is it is the bad group I
[2:04:23.880 --> 2:04:28.640]  understand as people get sick of religion and all this my whole point is I see
[2:04:28.640 --> 2:04:32.280]  as I guys the dendym and it's all theosophic society New World Order stuff
[2:04:32.280 --> 2:04:35.480]  I've heard a million times before and they're claiming no it's not it's it's
[2:04:35.480 --> 2:04:39.720]  new and you're just a Christians you're saying that I'm like no I'm saying that
[2:04:39.720 --> 2:04:45.080]  from a cold-blooded stance analyzing what they're saying they you know they
[2:04:45.080 --> 2:04:48.400]  can't say there's no religion you're a bunch of idiots as a way to then get all
[2:04:48.400 --> 2:04:53.240]  the atheists on an occultic bandwagon that is deceptive that is hidden and
[2:04:53.240 --> 2:04:57.040]  that's why they call it the occult because it is hidden and with true
[2:04:57.040 --> 2:05:01.600]  Christianity it's all open but listen good hearing from you you know as a
[2:05:01.600 --> 2:05:04.640]  father and a husband one of the enjoyable things in my life has been
[2:05:04.640 --> 2:05:08.640]  walking in at night and checking on my children checking up on my wife making

[2:09:13.520 --> 2:09:19.240]  desk and that also supports the makers of the film because this is this is
[2:09:19.240 --> 2:09:22.920]  everything you know money should just be an agreed upon symbol of exchange but
[2:09:22.920 --> 2:09:28.640]  instead money has become everything that's the product and the private banks
[2:09:28.640 --> 2:09:31.880]  that control the issuance of it are buying up the world and and to put it
[2:09:31.880 --> 2:09:36.920]  simply only get his take on this put it simply they have engineered the
[2:09:36.920 --> 2:09:42.400]  derivatives crisis they have engineered the credit crisis they've cut almost all
[2:09:42.400 --> 2:09:46.920]  credit off to main street and even corporations that are mid-level well an
[2:09:46.920 --> 2:09:50.680]  inner group of less than ten banks is given trillions and trillions of
[2:09:50.680 --> 2:09:55.240]  dollars while the dollar and the euro still has some value they're gonna pass
[2:09:55.240 --> 2:10:01.080]  us on then the hyperinflation it brings and will claim via the government that
[2:10:01.080 --> 2:10:07.240]  we back the currency through our labor credit and faith and that we then owe
[2:10:07.240 --> 2:10:11.400]  the taxes on these tens of trillions they are creating and giving to
[2:10:11.400 --> 2:10:14.760]  themselves so they take it while still has value they buy real assets they are
[2:10:14.760 --> 2:10:21.440]  getting themselves cash flush right now to be able to as they bring in a world
[2:10:21.440 --> 2:10:25.120]  depression consolidate their control and as we told you many years ago they would
[2:10:25.120 --> 2:10:29.680]  then propose a world government for and by run by the private bankers where you
[2:10:29.680 --> 2:10:33.200]  still have your national currencies but it's set every day by this global
[2:10:33.200 --> 2:10:36.400]  consortium of private banks internationally and that you would then pay
[2:10:36.400 --> 2:10:40.000]  a global carbon tax how do we know all this they said they were gonna do this
[2:10:40.000 --> 2:10:45.280]  pay a global carbon tax to the private banks they are becoming the government
[2:10:45.280 --> 2:10:52.320]  this isn't the government nationalizing the banks this isn't the the socialism
[2:10:52.320 --> 2:10:55.440]  as you're hearing which is bad enough because it devalues the currency and
[2:10:55.440 --> 2:10:59.720]  makes the people you know basically feed at the trough be domesticated and
[2:10:59.720 --> 2:11:03.200]  bankrupts things and always has corruption associated to creates more
[2:11:03.200 --> 2:11:07.760]  power for the elites this is the corporatization the private corporate
[2:11:07.760 --> 2:11:12.440]  takeover of the governmental systems of the treasuries fully but they started
[2:11:12.440 --> 2:11:16.640]  here in nineteen thirteen in england in the eighteen fifteen uh... so i will
[2:11:16.640 --> 2:11:19.680]  go ahead and bring up pat karmak he has quite a bio
[2:11:19.680 --> 2:11:23.600]  uh... but uh... pat you know you're uniquely qualified to be able to speak
[2:11:23.600 --> 2:11:24.880]  to all this tell
[2:11:24.880 --> 2:11:28.160]  tell folks uh... about a little bit about yourself
[2:11:28.160 --> 2:11:31.760]  well uh... good beyond the show i would like you very much for having me
[2:11:31.760 --> 2:11:36.160]  uh... well my background pretty varied uh... i was in business
[2:11:36.160 --> 2:11:39.160]  uh... i was a judge of the oklahoma corporation commission
[2:11:39.160 --> 2:11:40.720]  administrative law
[2:11:40.720 --> 2:11:45.520]  and uh... i i was ran on all company private independent
[2:11:45.520 --> 2:11:47.320]  company in oklahoma
[2:11:47.320 --> 2:11:52.880]  that uh... also had a utility so as an integrated energy company small one
[2:11:52.880 --> 2:11:56.880]  and uh... i've been involved in various other businesses and so forth
[2:11:56.880 --> 2:12:00.160]  in the nineteen nineties i got rather involved in uh...
[2:12:00.160 --> 2:12:02.160]  finance more and
[2:12:02.160 --> 2:12:03.840]  uh... with bill still
[2:12:03.840 --> 2:12:06.320]  uh... we put together the movie the money masters
[2:12:06.320 --> 2:12:08.240]  uh... what you've mentioned
[2:12:08.240 --> 2:12:12.200]  and uh... in that period uh... became associated with uh...
[2:12:12.200 --> 2:12:14.520]  a number of economists and
[2:12:14.520 --> 2:12:15.920]  in doing the film that
[2:12:15.920 --> 2:12:19.160]  probably the most influential was melton freedman
[2:12:19.160 --> 2:12:21.680]  uh... my consultant with
[2:12:21.680 --> 2:12:23.000]  and uh...
[2:12:23.000 --> 2:12:26.600]  so uh... and since that time uh...
[2:12:26.600 --> 2:12:28.920]  i've maintained my interest in
[2:12:28.920 --> 2:12:32.360]  the financial sector and so forth and uh... numerous and you've got all these
[2:12:32.360 --> 2:12:35.600]  experts admitting from the historical documents with the congressional record
[2:12:35.600 --> 2:12:37.800]  the great depression was engineered
[2:12:37.800 --> 2:12:41.920]  uh... you heard me you know my little uh... summation of what we're
[2:12:41.920 --> 2:12:47.160]  saying happen right now in your expert opinion is that accurate
[2:12:47.160 --> 2:12:51.240]  and it's not a that that the that the great depression was engineered is is
[2:12:51.240 --> 2:12:54.360]  not denied by anyone who's familiar with with it
[2:12:54.360 --> 2:12:56.120]  deal anymore i mean
[2:12:56.120 --> 2:13:01.040]  uh... it's been admitted even recently by a benvernanke at at the
[2:13:01.040 --> 2:13:02.800]  university of chicago
[2:13:02.800 --> 2:13:04.520]  and uh... where he
[2:13:04.520 --> 2:13:08.840]  where he was uh... at a birthday uh... batch for melton freedman who's still
[2:13:08.840 --> 2:13:10.480]  out at that time and
[2:13:10.480 --> 2:13:13.960]  and he admitted that melton freedman maintain that's what happened and
[2:13:13.960 --> 2:13:17.960]  basically i mean it's very simple the uh... fed contracted money at that time
[2:13:17.960 --> 2:13:19.000]  right now they're in a
[2:13:19.000 --> 2:13:22.520]  you know the rapidly expanding the money supply
[2:13:22.520 --> 2:13:25.840]  uh... at least the fed is but only to themselves
[2:13:25.840 --> 2:13:28.640]  you know that's really right and that's all that you know it was really
[2:13:28.640 --> 2:13:30.320]  interesting there was a
[2:13:30.320 --> 2:13:33.200]  an article where they were talking to a fellow at a
[2:13:33.200 --> 2:13:35.720]  jp morgan and they said what do you what are you guys going to do with the
[2:13:35.720 --> 2:13:37.080]  twenty five billion that
[2:13:37.080 --> 2:13:38.960]  the feds going to give you
[2:13:38.960 --> 2:13:42.440]  and he said we don't really don't quite know what we're going to do with it yet
[2:13:42.440 --> 2:13:44.680]  well it's kind of interesting because
[2:13:44.680 --> 2:13:45.560]  uh...
[2:13:45.560 --> 2:13:49.760]  jp morgan they're a profit for the last quarter was five hundred twenty seven
[2:13:49.760 --> 2:13:51.400]  million dollars
[2:13:51.400 --> 2:13:55.000]  and while that's down it's still in a vast amount of money
[2:13:55.000 --> 2:13:58.200]  if you look at you mentioned there's just several banks that control everything
[2:13:58.200 --> 2:14:01.440]  now and it's all been consolidated if you know
[2:14:01.440 --> 2:14:04.800]  if you look at uh... you know bank of america in the same quarter had one point
[2:14:04.800 --> 2:14:08.120]  one eight billion profit wells for growth but had a
[2:14:08.120 --> 2:14:11.480]  one point six billion city hasn't released it yet and by the way we all
[2:14:11.480 --> 2:14:14.760]  know those are cooked books and you got all the people being paid
[2:14:14.760 --> 2:14:17.800]  uh... actually making the profit so those of you it's like hollywood
[2:14:17.800 --> 2:14:20.240]  you know uh... movie that makes three hundred million dollars that cost a
[2:14:20.240 --> 2:14:22.560]  hundred million they always say it lost money
[2:14:22.560 --> 2:14:24.240]  that's right
[2:14:24.240 --> 2:14:25.560]  well in that in that
[2:14:25.560 --> 2:14:26.840]  ninety day period of
[2:14:26.840 --> 2:14:31.360]  of the of three major banks the profit that they've admitted
[2:14:31.360 --> 2:14:36.240]  was three point three billion which is thirty six million dollars a day
[2:14:36.240 --> 2:14:38.120]  and we're bailing them out
[2:14:38.120 --> 2:14:39.560]  the taxpayers
[2:14:39.560 --> 2:14:44.200]  uh... taxes are being handed over to these banks to to basically to do with
[2:14:44.200 --> 2:14:45.480]  what they will
[2:14:45.480 --> 2:14:48.680]  when they have that kind of bastard how amazing was that to have secret
[2:14:48.680 --> 2:14:50.080]  meetings repulsion
[2:14:50.080 --> 2:14:51.760]  is even handing money to his own
[2:14:51.760 --> 2:14:56.400]  former brokerage firm goldman sacks i mean just on the face bank robbery
[2:14:56.400 --> 2:15:01.160]  yeah it's obviously there's tremendous conflict of interest there and
[2:15:01.160 --> 2:15:03.160]  this is a it's a huge it's it's
[2:15:03.160 --> 2:15:07.320]  bailouts really the wrong word for i mean these banks didn't need to be bailed
[2:15:07.320 --> 2:15:08.160]  out
[2:15:08.160 --> 2:15:12.080]  as you know they have taken over recently merrill lynch
[2:15:12.080 --> 2:15:13.760]  and uh...
[2:15:13.760 --> 2:15:15.160]  what jovia
[2:15:15.160 --> 2:15:18.360]  that's right they've used government regulation to force deals with other
[2:15:18.360 --> 2:15:20.840]  institutions in his business week said this week
[2:15:20.840 --> 2:15:24.960]  this is actually a great consolidation this is a bumper crop for them
[2:15:24.960 --> 2:15:29.800]  yeah if if you're in one of these format four or five major banks
[2:15:29.800 --> 2:15:31.380]  uh... then uh...
[2:15:31.380 --> 2:15:34.800]  this is this is the golden opportunity that you've been waiting for this
[2:15:34.800 --> 2:15:37.800]  happens but historically this is nothing new
[2:15:37.800 --> 2:15:40.560]  every time there's a major economic crisis
[2:15:40.560 --> 2:15:44.040]  uh... some of the smaller banks get in trouble
[2:15:44.040 --> 2:15:47.800]  and the larger one swallow them up here we have the u.s. government helping
[2:15:47.800 --> 2:15:50.800]  fund this consolidate exactly so so
[2:15:50.800 --> 2:15:53.600]  let's go back to the country for you know now in twenty months or so let's go
[2:15:53.600 --> 2:15:54.520]  through this
[2:15:54.520 --> 2:15:57.520]  let's look at the depression first that you cover so well
[2:15:57.520 --> 2:15:58.680]  mister still
[2:15:58.680 --> 2:16:01.800]  uh... in uh... the money masters that because i mean it's all there so much
[2:16:01.800 --> 2:16:04.160]  evidence is three and a half hours folks it's amazing
[2:16:04.160 --> 2:16:07.560]  i mean and i know that was a tiny fraction of how they engineered that
[2:16:07.560 --> 2:16:10.320]  versus this that's even worse
[2:16:10.320 --> 2:16:14.040]  well this is similar in a lot of ways you know the uh...
[2:16:14.040 --> 2:16:17.720]  you know the banks are in control of credit obviously and so if they do
[2:16:17.720 --> 2:16:21.120]  something like for instance are calling in loans
[2:16:21.120 --> 2:16:24.600]  then that the people they call the loans and from have to sell something or to
[2:16:24.600 --> 2:16:28.480]  pay the loans early in most notes allow banks to call them in early
[2:16:28.480 --> 2:16:32.480]  this can also happen on the stock market with the protocol margin calls
[2:16:32.480 --> 2:16:34.440]  where uh... the banks you know have
[2:16:34.440 --> 2:16:36.840]  loaned money to their investors
[2:16:36.840 --> 2:16:39.560]  who want to speculate on the stock market
[2:16:39.560 --> 2:16:40.600]  and uh... it
[2:16:40.600 --> 2:16:44.600]  you know the percentages vary but let's use twenty five percent for now
[2:16:44.600 --> 2:16:48.480]  uh... if they if the investor only has to put up twenty five percent of the
[2:16:48.480 --> 2:16:49.360]  money
[2:16:49.360 --> 2:16:53.520]  and the brokerage house is providing seventy five percent
[2:16:53.520 --> 2:16:57.640]  and the brokerage house increases that arbitrarily on there and which they're
[2:16:57.640 --> 2:16:59.760]  doing now and have done
[2:16:59.760 --> 2:17:02.560]  uh... then the investor suddenly has to come up with the money
[2:17:02.560 --> 2:17:05.160]  well typically how do they do that because they're
[2:17:05.160 --> 2:17:07.600]  you know they're they've borrowed money
[2:17:07.600 --> 2:17:10.240]  to invest in the stock market sell stocks
[2:17:10.240 --> 2:17:13.520]  so you start a snowball so they have to sell stocks which depresses the market
[2:17:13.520 --> 2:17:16.040]  they have some more stocks
[2:17:16.040 --> 2:17:19.920]  margin calls go up they don't have the money and you start a free fall of
[2:17:19.920 --> 2:17:21.480]  course that's what happened
[2:17:21.480 --> 2:17:25.760]  so the banks control this but i mean while this is key folks if you missed it
[2:17:25.760 --> 2:17:28.240]  they're claiming they're trying to keep the market up
[2:17:28.240 --> 2:17:32.040]  uh... when in reality uh... they're actually driving it down and then with
[2:17:32.040 --> 2:17:34.080]  the money they get from people to have a stock
[2:17:34.080 --> 2:17:37.560]  they come back in with the bailout money and buy it back up for themselves
[2:17:37.560 --> 2:17:40.600]  yeah because they're not really panic for these major banks have been through
[2:17:40.600 --> 2:17:42.400]  this repeatedly
[2:17:42.400 --> 2:17:43.920]  uh... you know that
[2:17:43.920 --> 2:17:49.720]  eight you know there's a debate today initiate the and uh... critical
[2:17:49.720 --> 2:17:53.840]  catalyst that caused the the uh... downfall or do they sent or they simply
[2:17:53.840 --> 2:17:56.720]  aware of it much faster than anyone else and then take the
[2:17:56.720 --> 2:18:00.840]  appropriate steps with which they're all for also much more familiar with them
[2:18:00.840 --> 2:18:04.400]  ordinary folks and it really doesn't matter the point is they've been
[2:18:04.400 --> 2:18:06.600]  they usually profit
[2:18:06.600 --> 2:18:08.560]  from it because either they
[2:18:08.560 --> 2:18:11.560]  either they engineer it or they're the first to know of it
[2:18:11.560 --> 2:18:15.240]  but i don't have a door i mean the the the guys running the bailout now and
[2:18:15.240 --> 2:18:16.080]  getting the money
[2:18:16.080 --> 2:18:18.200]  are the ones that change the uh...
[2:18:18.200 --> 2:18:21.600]  the different acts in the nineties bill to do this of course that's exactly
[2:18:21.600 --> 2:18:22.960]  right i mean
[2:18:22.960 --> 2:18:27.320]  it right now one of the beneficiaries indirectly is goldman sex and of course
[2:18:27.320 --> 2:18:28.800]  there uh...
[2:18:28.800 --> 2:18:32.560]  uh... paulson was from their brunakis from there you know that it's just
[2:18:32.560 --> 2:18:36.160]  and it but it's a wall street crowd that's you know frankly it's very
[2:18:36.160 --> 2:18:38.000]  incestuous they're just
[2:18:38.000 --> 2:18:41.760]  you know that it's what they mentioned revolving or relationship they go into
[2:18:41.760 --> 2:18:43.840]  government back to the banks in the government
[2:18:43.840 --> 2:18:45.560]  and make huge amounts
[2:18:45.560 --> 2:18:48.600]  you know it's interesting but the uh...
[2:18:48.600 --> 2:18:52.600]  the fifty-highest private investment fund managers on wall street
[2:18:52.600 --> 2:18:59.360]  averaged five hundred and eighty eight million dollars in annual compensation
[2:18:59.360 --> 2:19:04.120]  uh... in two thousand seven that's nineteen thousand times the average
[2:19:04.120 --> 2:19:06.600]  workers pain america
[2:19:06.600 --> 2:19:11.560]  if you want to look at another couple of that that gives you some idea of the
[2:19:11.560 --> 2:19:13.120]  uh...
[2:19:13.120 --> 2:19:17.320]  interplay between government and wall street ahead of the idea was the other
[2:19:17.320 --> 2:19:19.760]  one who who who who made three billion
[2:19:19.760 --> 2:19:21.680]  dollars in five years
[2:19:21.680 --> 2:19:24.520]  i didn't see that statistic i don't know i was on the news i'm pretty much

[2:24:46.760 --> 2:24:50.800]  better crystal balls and I prefer to refer to them one of them was Carol
[2:24:50.800 --> 2:24:56.920]  Quigley who is a professor at Georgetown he's a macro historian and he taught a
[2:24:56.920 --> 2:25:01.280]  lot of our foreign service folks and he wrote a book called tragedy and hope
[2:25:01.280 --> 2:25:07.280]  history of the world in our time and this is the book given to the foreign
[2:25:07.280 --> 2:25:11.840]  service this is the what the internal do you type book was public but but an
[2:25:11.840 --> 2:25:16.240]  inside baseball on how things really run and it's everything we say here yeah
[2:25:16.240 --> 2:25:22.440]  and and one of the key quotes in it is is this one is brief is quick with
[2:25:22.440 --> 2:25:26.880]  professor quigley wrote the powers of financial capitalism had a far-reaching
[2:25:26.880 --> 2:25:32.360]  plan nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private
[2:25:32.360 --> 2:25:36.480]  hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy
[2:25:36.480 --> 2:25:40.720]  of the world as a whole their secret is that they have annexed from governments
[2:25:40.720 --> 2:25:46.160]  monarchies and republics the power to create the world's money so I mean
[2:25:46.160 --> 2:25:49.160]  ultimately what this is that's the end of the quote ultimately what this is it's
[2:25:49.160 --> 2:25:54.600]  it's a world power grab now you know there's some discussion about how bad
[2:25:54.600 --> 2:25:57.960]  will this get and so forth and and I don't know the answer to that but
[2:25:57.960 --> 2:26:05.520]  historically you know there's been a gradual process since 1913 there's been
[2:26:05.520 --> 2:26:11.600]  peaks in it like the Great Depression and certain periods after World War two
[2:26:11.600 --> 2:26:17.120]  were inflation was higher where the the wealth consolidation was accelerated but
[2:26:17.120 --> 2:26:22.600]  basically it's been a non-stop concentration of wealth for nearly 100
[2:26:22.600 --> 2:26:27.640]  years now which has driven Americans from being independently productive
[2:26:27.640 --> 2:26:31.960]  individuals own their own farms and small businesses to being in debt up to
[2:26:31.960 --> 2:26:36.080]  their eyeballs and of course when that happens when you're in debt to someone
[2:26:36.080 --> 2:26:45.560]  else then as Aristotle and and Aquinas and others have pointed out the ones of
[2:26:45.560 --> 2:26:49.560]  us who has tested because it's very hard to stand up to people that you owe money
[2:26:49.560 --> 2:26:54.440]  to and who can fire you and so they take control of the country and and then you
[2:26:54.440 --> 2:26:58.160]  can't afford private education and so it's public education which is there to
[2:26:58.160 --> 2:27:01.800]  get your children into the prison system dumb them down put them on drugs legal
[2:27:01.800 --> 2:27:05.400]  anti-legal I mean it's just a huge social engineering nightmare and it's all
[2:27:05.400 --> 2:27:11.480]  stated publicly yeah if you take a population and educate them well
[2:27:11.480 --> 2:27:15.040]  they're not gonna stand for this kind of thing so there's been a gradual as you
[2:27:15.040 --> 2:27:19.720]  put it coming down of the American population so in one of the areas that
[2:27:19.720 --> 2:27:23.160]  they've succeeded almost totally in economics most Americans understand
[2:27:23.160 --> 2:27:27.480]  very very little of it so they don't understand the mechanism or by their
[2:27:27.480 --> 2:27:33.760]  being made into debt slaves and so you know right now over 90 percent of
[2:27:33.760 --> 2:27:38.920]  Americans have no net wealth if they pay their debts they have nothing left at
[2:27:38.920 --> 2:27:42.440]  all and most of course would still have debt even if they sold everything they
[2:27:42.440 --> 2:27:46.400]  had so we're for those of us that have saved they're just gonna hyper inflate
[2:27:46.400 --> 2:27:50.000]  everything when they took the currency they hyperinflated and again bought real
[2:27:50.000 --> 2:27:53.480]  things when it still had worth and then they leave us with all the debt and then
[2:27:53.480 --> 2:27:56.760]  claim we have to pay it all back well that's right and that's happening
[2:27:56.760 --> 2:28:02.720]  worldwide of course and so this process isn't restricted the United States the
[2:28:02.720 --> 2:28:06.600]  the fractional reserve banking system set up by the Federal Reserve Act of
[2:28:06.600 --> 2:28:13.320]  1913 here it was replicated that in all around the world we weren't the first to
[2:28:13.320 --> 2:28:17.760]  have it as you mentioned the first nation that was really yoked to a
[2:28:17.760 --> 2:28:23.080]  privately owned central bank was England in the right after the glorious
[2:28:23.080 --> 2:28:29.200]  revolution in 1694 but that spread all around and then we saw what happened
[2:28:29.200 --> 2:28:32.400]  when when a private banking cartel with its own intelligence agency got
[2:28:32.400 --> 2:28:38.400]  control of a powerful seafaring empire look out that's right and what what you
[2:28:38.400 --> 2:28:45.600]  have now is this is the vehicle this debt enslavement that's used to it's
[2:28:45.600 --> 2:28:50.720]  being used to control the world and most of what you see most of the war is
[2:28:50.720 --> 2:28:55.440]  another major political events that happen have to do with extending or
[2:28:55.440 --> 2:29:02.280]  protecting this regime this monetary regime we're gonna come back with a
[2:29:02.280 --> 2:29:07.280]  long segment and then later we're gonna take calls at 1-800-25 at 99231 but
[2:29:07.280 --> 2:29:10.680]  but there's so much to talk about in the width and breadth of this but the
[2:29:10.680 --> 2:29:14.120]  bottom line this is the key information I mean this is what makes the world go
[2:29:14.120 --> 2:29:17.720]  around this is who's dominating controlling things and these guys are
[2:29:17.720 --> 2:29:21.200]  masters they're using their controlled corporate media they own to claim oh see
[2:29:21.200 --> 2:29:25.280]  this is the free market see only socialism will save you now but socialism
[2:29:25.280 --> 2:29:29.480]  will further consolidate the middle-class wealth and then it's taken up to a
[2:29:29.480 --> 2:29:34.120]  higher level when then it goes from being socialism into fascism being handed
[2:29:34.120 --> 2:29:39.160]  directly to the bankers so just any you know you're I mean there's so much you
[2:29:39.160 --> 2:29:43.600]  probably want to get into and angles you want to talk about so we'll go wherever
[2:29:43.600 --> 2:29:47.840]  you'd like other side with Pat Carmack I've got a lot of questions too but I
[2:29:47.840 --> 2:29:52.040]  want to hear what he thinks is most important stay with us we're on the
[2:29:52.040 --> 2:30:00.080]  march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[2:35:38.480 --> 2:35:43.480]  I went down to access TV and there over and over and over again and I know it
[2:35:43.480 --> 2:35:49.480]  was there all over access TV at the time were you ever aware because I was
[2:35:49.480 --> 2:35:54.480]  Pat I don't know if you were of how big your film was on access TV still today
[2:35:54.480 --> 2:36:00.480]  well no I in the past I just heard of it you know here and there but I wasn't
[2:36:00.480 --> 2:36:05.480]  aware I've since found out that you know it was being shown all over the place
[2:36:05.480 --> 2:36:11.480]  we're getting several requests daily at our website for permission to do a public
[2:36:11.480 --> 2:36:17.480]  broadcast and we do allow it with conditions and among them are that they
[2:36:17.480 --> 2:36:20.480]  not charge a fee and so on you know yeah well back then I mean I didn't wait
[2:36:20.480 --> 2:36:25.480]  for orders from headquarters I was just getting it on you know and you know
[2:36:25.480 --> 2:36:28.480]  just getting it out to people because I mean I was airing lots of documentaries
[2:36:28.480 --> 2:36:32.480]  but I'm glad you guys let people do that you obviously have to have some conditions
[2:36:32.480 --> 2:36:36.480]  or people will then claim that it's theirs and you'll lose control of the film
[2:36:36.480 --> 2:36:41.480]  well that and also we lose control of content if we can't tell who's doing it
[2:36:41.480 --> 2:36:45.480]  when they're doing it because people could edit it and alter the message so
[2:36:45.480 --> 2:36:50.480]  that's very important us that we you know that it frankly the bankers don't
[2:36:50.480 --> 2:36:54.480]  do that so yeah well that's you know that's my biggest problem is people take
[2:36:54.480 --> 2:36:58.480]  my films they include it in their films right and then I get people saying how
[2:36:58.480 --> 2:37:02.480]  dare you steal this idea from belly Bob I mean I can march up to a Bilderberg
[2:37:02.480 --> 2:37:07.480]  group meeting and say the answer to 1984 1776 and then young kids will say you
[2:37:07.480 --> 2:37:10.480]  stole that from another kid I just saw bullhorning that you know they got that
[2:37:10.480 --> 2:37:15.480]  for me and I don't care that's great but people take my films and use clips in
[2:37:15.480 --> 2:37:18.480]  their films and then people don't agree with the message of the other film my
[2:37:18.480 --> 2:37:22.480]  stuff's in and then people hate me because of it exactly so it is important to
[2:37:22.480 --> 2:37:28.480]  maintain ownership control and we have done that but nevertheless it's being
[2:37:28.480 --> 2:37:34.480]  shown all over the country now on public access channels in on college campuses
[2:37:34.480 --> 2:37:38.480]  and so forth because people obviously are suffering now economically and they
[2:37:38.480 --> 2:37:42.480]  want to understand the system and that's wonderful because they realize they
[2:37:42.480 --> 2:37:47.480]  don't understand it and you predicted everything that is now happening in the
[2:37:47.480 --> 2:37:51.480]  film and so it's like fine wine it gets even better with age okay sir what is
[2:37:51.480 --> 2:37:53.480]  most important what do you want to get into because I could ask questions all
[2:37:53.480 --> 2:37:57.480]  day and interrupt all day well you know of course two things have happened
[2:37:57.480 --> 2:38:05.480]  lately one one besides the crisis itself one is the bailout and I want to
[2:38:05.480 --> 2:38:09.480]  discuss that just a little bit we have a little bit you know it's you
[2:38:09.480 --> 2:38:13.480]  summarized it well I think and that is that you know it's just it's taxpayer
[2:38:13.480 --> 2:38:19.480]  money in a sense and another sense is not they're creating it I mean the Fed's
[2:38:19.480 --> 2:38:23.480]  creating a lot of this money now which they're but taxpayers will ultimately
[2:38:23.480 --> 2:38:28.480]  have to pay the bill for it and it's being given to not the poor they're not
[2:38:28.480 --> 2:38:32.480]  they're not going out and handing 25 billion dollars out in the slums of the
[2:38:32.480 --> 2:38:37.480]  United States or to people being foreclosed on or people who have lost
[2:38:37.480 --> 2:38:42.480]  their jobs or anybody that really needs it they're handing it to fabulously
[2:38:42.480 --> 2:38:47.480]  wealthy corporations now that's obscene and that was engineered by people who
[2:38:47.480 --> 2:38:52.480]  came from these same banks who are working for our government unfortunately
[2:38:52.480 --> 2:38:58.480]  neither presidential candidate has addressed this and they both supported
[2:38:58.480 --> 2:39:04.480]  the the bailout I think it's because they don't understand it they're also
[2:39:04.480 --> 2:39:09.480]  bought and paid for well they have bank handlers in their campaigns and you know
[2:39:09.480 --> 2:39:14.480]  obviously if they were to really promote some kind of reform their money would
[2:39:14.480 --> 2:39:18.480]  begin to dry up opposition would start getting more money so they both play
[2:39:18.480 --> 2:39:23.480]  the game how much they understand it I don't know but from their public
[2:39:23.480 --> 2:39:26.480]  utterances one would have to assume they're utterly ignorant of this whole
[2:39:26.480 --> 2:39:30.480]  problem and what the cures are since they're both intelligent men that's
[2:39:30.480 --> 2:39:34.480]  rather hard to believe Ron Paul understands it but of course he didn't
[2:39:34.480 --> 2:39:41.480]  win the Republican nomination and so we don't have a prominent political
[2:39:41.480 --> 2:39:45.480]  leader at this time that we can turn to you know the closest we have at the
[2:39:45.480 --> 2:39:49.480]  moment it is some of the third-party presidential candidates who you know
[2:39:49.480 --> 2:39:55.480]  unfortunately are in single digits in the polls and so we really just don't
[2:39:55.480 --> 2:40:00.480]  have a prominent leader at the moment you know that like what like they did in
[2:40:00.480 --> 2:40:04.480]  the Great Depression in the Great Depression of course people were
[2:40:04.480 --> 2:40:09.480]  suffering more than we are at this point not everybody I mean some people are
[2:40:09.480 --> 2:40:12.480]  suffering right now just as much as others did back then obviously but
[2:40:12.480 --> 2:40:18.480]  overall we're not to the same depth of a depression that they were saying 1930
[2:40:18.480 --> 2:40:22.480]  to 33 but they had political leaders arise at that time so we will and it's
[2:40:22.480 --> 2:40:27.480]  important that they that the people know what solutions are the appropriate
[2:40:27.480 --> 2:40:32.480]  ones and not be misled because in every depression or recession the banks
[2:40:32.480 --> 2:40:36.480]  through politicians they support with their packs and donations and mass
[2:40:36.480 --> 2:40:43.480]  media come up with all solutions like this bailout and there's another I did
[2:40:43.480 --> 2:40:49.480]  want to mention too what what degree of consolidation have we reached now when
[2:40:49.480 --> 2:40:56.480]  when City Corp takes over Merrill Lynch and JP Morgan takes over Wall Moon
[2:40:56.480 --> 2:41:01.480]  Bear Stearns and Wells Fargo takes over Whatchovie well here's their here's
[2:41:01.480 --> 2:41:08.480]  their assets now approximately city group now has assets of approximately 3.1
[2:41:08.480 --> 2:41:18.480]  trillion dollars JP Morgan is now in excess of two trillion dollars bank of
[2:41:18.480 --> 2:41:26.480]  America 1.7 trillion Wells Fargo 1.4 trillion collectively they control over
[2:41:26.480 --> 2:41:33.480]  8 trillion dollars in assets which is basically I'd say it's fair to say it's
[2:41:33.480 --> 2:41:41.480]  the completion of the consolidation of the process that was begun back in 1913
[2:41:41.480 --> 2:41:46.480]  whenever as I recall they're approximately 20,000 banks back then and no one bank
[2:41:46.480 --> 2:41:51.480]  anything even remotely like this kind of dominant power among all those banks
[2:41:51.480 --> 2:41:55.480]  that was the beginning of the consolidation we've now reached the point
[2:41:55.480 --> 2:42:03.480]  where these four banks now control over 8 trillion dollars if you realize that
[2:42:03.480 --> 2:42:10.480]  the total loans in the economy commercial bank loans are only about 10 trillion
[2:42:10.480 --> 2:42:16.480]  dollars so you can you one can and also that a lot of people don't know this but
[2:42:16.480 --> 2:42:23.480]  the Federal Reserve is in fact a stock corporation the stock is owned in each
[2:42:23.480 --> 2:42:28.480]  of each of the 12 branch banks by the banks that are members of the Federal
[2:42:28.480 --> 2:42:32.480]  Reserve system in that region so for instance there's a Federal Reserve bank
[2:42:32.480 --> 2:42:36.480]  in Dallas and the banks in that region that belong to the Federal Reserve
[2:42:36.480 --> 2:42:40.480]  system own the stock of that bank and they point six of the nine directors but
[2:42:40.480 --> 2:42:45.480]  that's closed stock for those that don't know you I can't waddle down and buy
[2:42:45.480 --> 2:42:50.480]  stocks specifically in that inner you know held corporate stock versus the stock
[2:42:50.480 --> 2:42:58.480]  of the bank itself that's the public stock right and so with so the local banks
[2:42:58.480 --> 2:43:05.480]  control it and and it's based on their net capital so these major banks now
[2:43:05.480 --> 2:43:12.480]  control the majority stock of the Federal Reserve system nationwide so you
[2:43:12.480 --> 2:43:17.480]  have four banks that control the Federal Reserve system now it's true the
[2:43:17.480 --> 2:43:22.480]  Federal Reserve has quasi-governmental things like the president nominates and
[2:43:22.480 --> 2:43:25.480]  the Senate has to approve the seven you know governors of the Federal Reserve
[2:43:25.480 --> 2:43:33.480]  Board but they serve 14 year terms only one every two years is nominated by the
[2:43:33.480 --> 2:43:37.480]  president and if in a four-year term he could only change two of them if he
[2:43:37.480 --> 2:43:40.480]  wanted to and were successful in doing that which would be very difficult for
[2:43:40.480 --> 2:43:45.480]  a president to do because they control the media and let go after him if he were
[2:43:45.480 --> 2:43:50.480]  able to be president get reelected having done so which would be unlikely in an
[2:43:50.480 --> 2:43:54.480]  eight-year term since they have four year 14 year terms he could only replace
[2:43:54.480 --> 2:44:00.480]  four of them and of course that would be at the very end of his eight years
[2:44:00.480 --> 2:44:04.480]  which is unlikely he would succeed in doing that so basically it's an
[2:44:04.480 --> 2:44:09.480]  independent body of bankers controlling our national economy for the benefit of
[2:44:09.480 --> 2:44:14.480]  bankers I don't say anyone could reasonably say that giving these banks
[2:44:14.480 --> 2:44:19.480]  this these billions of dollars instead of giving it to the poor or people being
[2:44:19.480 --> 2:44:25.480]  foreclosed on our employer so on is just it's simply unjust this is a profoundly
[2:44:25.480 --> 2:44:31.480]  unjust system and it's concentrating wealth very very rapidly now it's an
[2:44:31.480 --> 2:44:36.480]  exponential process it only gets faster we're talking to pet karmak the
[2:44:36.480 --> 2:44:42.480]  producer of the definitive film on the global banking cartel that is the new
[2:44:42.480 --> 2:44:46.480]  world order is the crime syndicate are the people that hired the social workers
[2:44:46.480 --> 2:44:50.480]  and the sociologist and all the horrible things that are happening are stated
[2:44:50.480 --> 2:44:53.480]  in their own public documents that it's destroying the family destroying society
[2:44:53.480 --> 2:44:58.480]  making us popper slaves world population reduction theosophy I mean all of it
[2:44:58.480 --> 2:45:02.480]  that they're here they rule and they're they're not backing off the huge
[2:45:02.480 --> 2:45:08.480]  consolidation we're witnessing right now and again if they were going to take
[2:45:08.480 --> 2:45:13.480]  trillions of dollars and dump it on the public
[2:45:13.480 --> 2:45:18.480]  for a short time you would have wealth you know let's see if you have a hundred
[2:45:18.480 --> 2:45:22.480]  thousand dollars each person in America of the 300 million people you know for a
[2:45:22.480 --> 2:45:26.480]  while you would have some wealth and that would hyperinflate the currency and
[2:45:26.480 --> 2:45:30.480]  and then you'd have big problems from that and have to go to a new currency
[2:45:30.480 --> 2:45:35.480]  but instead and that's bad enough but instead they are pumping it into these
[2:45:35.480 --> 2:45:40.480]  international institutions a predominantly international foreign and
[2:45:40.480 --> 2:45:44.480]  they've stated they're using it to shore themselves up and to buy up more assets
[2:45:44.480 --> 2:45:49.480]  and while they continue to cut off currency liquidity credit to the public
[2:45:49.480 --> 2:45:54.480]  and so I mean they're they're giving us a no quarter
[2:45:54.480 --> 2:45:58.480]  I mean the economy already is grinding to a halt
[2:45:58.480 --> 2:46:02.480]  this is just going to be devastating well they know they've been through this
[2:46:02.480 --> 2:46:07.480]  before you know these the major bankers you know obviously have been
[2:46:07.480 --> 2:46:10.480]  schooled in economics and finance in the history of banking well they're
[2:46:10.480 --> 2:46:15.480]  constantly doing it in third world nations with their subsidiaries so
[2:46:15.480 --> 2:46:20.480]  right so none of this is new to them they know for instance that at the end of the day
[2:46:20.480 --> 2:46:24.480]  there will be plants and factories and farms in the United States they're not
[2:46:24.480 --> 2:46:28.480]  panicked thinking you know they somehow got to get out of town you know they're
[2:46:28.480 --> 2:46:32.480]  they're waiting for the prices to drop to the bottom to buy them up for pennies on
[2:46:32.480 --> 2:46:37.480]  a dollar they're foreclosing on homes because they know it'll all go back up
[2:46:37.480 --> 2:46:41.480]  as it always does eventually but it'll have new owners it'll be the banks
[2:46:41.480 --> 2:46:46.480]  again even this isn't new you know the bulk of the concentration of wealth in
[2:46:46.480 --> 2:46:53.480]  this nation has happened previously you know by in 1870 approximately
[2:46:53.480 --> 2:46:57.480]  you know most people like I mentioned had their own farms their own productive
[2:46:57.480 --> 2:47:02.480]  means of wealth they had no debt now it's totally reversed so and that happened
[2:47:02.480 --> 2:47:05.480]  and they've trained us that we have to have the bankers in debt to even get our
[2:47:05.480 --> 2:47:09.480]  paychecks or have a car we've totally been turned into sharecroppers
[2:47:09.480 --> 2:47:14.480]  exactly correct and you know they got homeowners with all the inflation that
[2:47:14.480 --> 2:47:18.480]  they they caused by you know running the printing presses and the budget deficits
[2:47:18.480 --> 2:47:24.480]  they got home you know the equity in homes at least on paper look like it went up
[2:47:24.480 --> 2:47:28.480]  so if you had a two hundred thousand dollar home say in 1995 you know by
[2:47:28.480 --> 2:47:32.480]  two thousand whatever five it's now we're four hundred thousand I'm two hundred
[2:47:32.480 --> 2:47:36.480]  thousand richer right well no it's the same home but what what they did then is
[2:47:36.480 --> 2:47:42.480]  they got the homeowners to get home equity loans and various other kinds of
[2:47:42.480 --> 2:47:47.480]  subprime mortgages and then they bundled those up and sold them and use that to
[2:47:47.480 --> 2:47:50.480]  leverage even more and now they've convinced the public that it's all the
[2:47:50.480 --> 2:47:54.480]  public's fault taking bad loans when they're just suckers that's a small part
[2:47:54.480 --> 2:48:00.480]  of the overall deal it's the bundling and the selling of the toxic debt well and
[2:48:00.480 --> 2:48:05.480]  also the misrepresentation at the seat in the subprime loans those things are
[2:48:05.480 --> 2:48:10.480]  extremely complex and the banks misrepresented them to when people
[2:48:10.480 --> 2:48:14.480]  come in and let me at this language I don't understand what does this mean
[2:48:14.480 --> 2:48:17.480]  and they would lie to them and I'm saying that because they're being sued all over
[2:48:17.480 --> 2:48:20.480]  the place they've already lost some cases let me ask you a question what is this
[2:48:20.480 --> 2:48:25.480]  where they're down till the last three years at a closing oh sign this form
[2:48:25.480 --> 2:48:30.480]  that there's any mistakes we can change the contract and then I've seen reports
[2:48:30.480 --> 2:48:35.480]  of them doing engaging in all sorts of chicanery what I'm not sure I'm not
[2:48:35.480 --> 2:48:38.480]  familiar with the point whether the power of attorney or what is yeah it's just a
[2:48:38.480 --> 2:48:42.480]  sheet saying if we make any mistakes on this loan or if there's any mistakes in
[2:48:42.480 --> 2:48:47.480]  this paperwork we're allowed to go change it however we want well I mean if you
[2:48:47.480 --> 2:48:50.480]  read the fine print on some of the literature you get from banks they're
[2:48:50.480 --> 2:48:55.480]  often adding things that are just incredible most people don't read the
[2:48:55.480 --> 2:49:00.480]  little tiny fine print and you know it allows them to change terms and conditions
[2:49:00.480 --> 2:49:03.480]  and if they do you get another letter in the mail you throw away but it has
[2:49:03.480 --> 2:49:08.480]  about a four-page document that inform informs you supposedly that you know
[2:49:08.480 --> 2:49:12.480]  the terms of your loan have been changed and people don't even know it and so
[2:49:12.480 --> 2:49:17.480]  you know that kind of thing obviously needs has to be addressed by lawsuits
[2:49:17.480 --> 2:49:21.480]  and it is being addressed by lawsuits but you know they have so much money and
[2:49:21.480 --> 2:49:26.480]  the average person that is struggling you know to fight with them has no money
[2:49:26.480 --> 2:49:30.480]  and so and they always think the banks making a mistake like when the cops
[2:49:30.480 --> 2:49:33.480]  arrest an innocent person or the bank takes somebody's house for no reason
[2:49:33.480 --> 2:49:38.480]  it's always I don't understand it it's a mistake and they don't care they're
[2:49:38.480 --> 2:49:42.480]  stupid no they're not stupid they're in control because they're ruthless crux
[2:49:42.480 --> 2:49:46.480]  well the the class action lawsuits that have already been successful in some
[2:49:46.480 --> 2:49:52.480]  instances are successful because it's established that it was a deliberate
[2:49:52.480 --> 2:49:57.480]  policy that the people that wrote the language knew it was ambiguous knew
[2:49:57.480 --> 2:50:00.480]  that people would misunderstand in a certain way and that they could tell
[2:50:00.480 --> 2:50:05.480]  the lower down you know bank employees who've met with the people a false
[2:50:05.480 --> 2:50:09.480]  version of what it meant and that those people would tell the borrowers those
[2:50:09.480 --> 2:50:12.480]  well that's right I mean you're a former judge but for those that don't know
[2:50:12.480 --> 2:50:16.480]  a lot of a lot of people that signed bad contract scam contracts and they think
[2:50:16.480 --> 2:50:19.480]  I can never get out of this I just have to let these people cheat me in business
[2:50:19.480 --> 2:50:24.480]  or whatever no a good contract needs to be fair and have compensation
[2:50:24.480 --> 2:50:30.480]  for the people involved and and so but but again the general public doesn't
[2:50:30.480 --> 2:50:34.480]  understand that well and they rely on the banks to tell them what the ambiguous
[2:50:34.480 --> 2:50:39.480]  language means and you know they don't have to do that they can go to
[2:50:39.480 --> 2:50:44.480]  law if they can afford it and have that addressed absolutely I know somebody
[2:50:44.480 --> 2:50:48.480]  in a film production who the person had them sign a contract where they could
[2:50:48.480 --> 2:50:51.480]  basically do whatever they wanted but that would be thrown out in court
[2:50:51.480 --> 2:50:55.480]  instantly it's written as a criminal instrument I mean it's on its face

[2:54:54.480 --> 2:54:58.480]  caused that we had nothing to do with the architects of it we need to be able
[2:54:58.480 --> 2:55:02.480]  to globally set what currencies are and commodities are and you know can so they
[2:55:02.480 --> 2:55:09.480]  can now even more insider trade in other sectors of the financial system and
[2:55:09.480 --> 2:55:13.480]  they say for decades they were gonna have a carbon tax to fund the new banks
[2:55:13.480 --> 2:55:17.480]  and then it's in the financial times of London BBC Barack Obama saying we're
[2:55:17.480 --> 2:55:21.480]  gonna pay our new carbon taxes to the banks themselves I mean they are
[2:55:21.480 --> 2:55:26.480]  becoming of the government and they're just out there openly stealing the
[2:55:26.480 --> 2:55:30.480]  money Ron Paul said they should be arrested he listed that the current fed
[2:55:30.480 --> 2:55:35.480]  chief the last fed chief he listed Paul said and listed the crimes and I mean
[2:55:35.480 --> 2:55:39.480]  that but but again they control the army they control north com even the
[2:55:39.480 --> 2:55:43.480]  military doesn't understand this stuff I mean this is I mean how do you
[2:55:43.480 --> 2:55:47.480]  unroot something that's been so systematic and scientific well obviously
[2:55:47.480 --> 2:55:51.480]  education is as the principal means and that's what you're doing right now and
[2:55:51.480 --> 2:55:57.480]  by the way I applaud you for that the media that's not controlled is the only
[2:55:57.480 --> 2:56:00.480]  source for the people to understand what's happening to them because they
[2:56:00.480 --> 2:56:05.480]  certainly will not get it on the major media they get just the opposite and
[2:56:05.480 --> 2:56:10.480]  you're right on the global scale the bank for international settlements the
[2:56:10.480 --> 2:56:15.480]  World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are replicating what the fed did
[2:56:15.480 --> 2:56:20.480]  in the United States and they're taking over government after government by
[2:56:20.480 --> 2:56:25.480]  making huge loans to those governments one of the ways is through you know a
[2:56:25.480 --> 2:56:29.480]  new form of money that was created some years ago called SDRs or special
[2:56:29.480 --> 2:56:36.480]  drawing rights which they simply create they loan it to the to the government
[2:56:36.480 --> 2:56:42.480]  sometimes to dictators who use use the money for terrible purposes or just
[2:56:42.480 --> 2:56:46.480]  corruption and you know put it in private bank Swiss bank accounts and so on
[2:56:46.480 --> 2:56:51.480]  and leave the poor nation like Mozambique or Columbia or whatever the
[2:56:51.480 --> 2:56:55.480]  third or fourth world nation is to pay the bill and they can't pay it and
[2:56:55.480 --> 2:56:59.480]  of course it forces them to tax the people use what little tax revenue there
[2:56:59.480 --> 2:57:05.480]  is not for social services but to pay the bankers from the United States or
[2:57:05.480 --> 2:57:10.480]  England or one of the other cooperating major banks that do that and they all
[2:57:10.480 --> 2:57:14.480]  created it out of nothing and it's come out nine million world bank documents
[2:57:14.480 --> 2:57:18.480]  they want the dictators of the corrupt leaders to default they all move to
[2:57:18.480 --> 2:57:21.480]  Switzerland well sure because that's precisely how they take over the nation
[2:57:21.480 --> 2:57:25.480]  and whatever nation it is this happened over and over again and then they can
[2:57:25.480 --> 2:57:32.480]  move in and with the different programs like snaps with the International
[2:57:32.480 --> 2:57:38.480]  Monetary Fund they can engineer things socially in that country as they wish
[2:57:38.480 --> 2:57:43.480]  they can require they can make all kinds of requirements and by the way the nation
[2:57:43.480 --> 2:57:47.480]  tries to be its own country they're immediately called terrorist black ops
[2:57:47.480 --> 2:57:50.480]  squads go in and overthrow them you know isn't just these countries accept this
[2:57:50.480 --> 2:57:53.480]  fiat currency they're told you do it or your brains are going to be on the
[2:57:53.480 --> 2:57:58.480]  contract yeah if you go to the International Monetary Fund they have a
[2:57:58.480 --> 2:58:02.480]  table in their annual report called it it's called the table of nations in
[2:58:02.480 --> 2:58:07.480]  arrears and almost every nation that has the misfortune of appearing on that
[2:58:07.480 --> 2:58:13.480]  in the arrears means in the end that payment winds up either being bombed
[2:58:13.480 --> 2:58:19.480]  or invaded or has a coup so you're right it's more than a knock at the door like
[2:58:19.480 --> 2:58:23.480]  the usual debt collector it gets pretty serious and I want to explain they're
[2:58:23.480 --> 2:58:30.480]  not gonna do that here police officers military FBI private mercenaries they
[2:58:30.480 --> 2:58:34.480]  are coming they have been trained you're the enemy they have been brainwashed

[3:00:20.480 --> 3:00:26.480]  but I wanted to recap basically what this international banking system is how
[3:00:26.480 --> 3:00:29.480]  they're operating for the short segment we're going to come back and go to your
[3:00:29.480 --> 3:00:33.480]  phone calls Pat well the international banking systems interconnected
[3:00:33.480 --> 3:00:40.480]  essentially what it is is an economic scheme and the scheme entails the
[3:00:40.480 --> 3:00:46.480]  creation of money by private banks most people think that the government
[3:00:46.480 --> 3:00:50.480]  creates all of our money because they look at our currency and it's printed
[3:00:50.480 --> 3:00:55.480]  by the Bureau of Engraving and so forth and they see there are coins by the U.S.
[3:00:55.480 --> 3:01:02.480]  Mint but the fact is due to the 1913 Federal Reserve Act which established
[3:01:02.480 --> 3:01:06.480]  our present our fundamental banking law our fundamental economic law for the
[3:01:06.480 --> 3:01:12.480]  United States that we still have it's nearly a hundred years old now it
[3:01:12.480 --> 3:01:21.480]  allows banks to make loans and only have 10% of the funds of the loan and reserve
[3:01:21.480 --> 3:01:27.480]  meaning they don't have deposits for it 100% behind the loans it's only about
[3:01:27.480 --> 3:01:32.480]  10% actually due to certain exceptions the law it's more like 2% but just for
[3:01:32.480 --> 3:01:40.480]  simplicity it's about 10% and so of the loans in the United States was
[3:01:40.480 --> 3:01:46.480]  totally nearly 10 trillion dollars the government has benefited from creating
[3:01:46.480 --> 3:01:52.480]  only about 10% of that and who gets the rest of the benefit is private banks
[3:01:52.480 --> 3:01:56.480]  and that of course benefits indirectly the stockholders of those banks and
[3:01:56.480 --> 3:02:01.480]  those people now control as much wealth 1% of the United States population
[3:02:01.480 --> 3:02:07.480]  owns as much as the other as the lower 95% so we've had a tremendous
[3:02:07.480 --> 3:02:11.480]  concentration of wealth which has changed the structure of American society
[3:02:11.480 --> 3:02:18.480]  it's making the great bulk of Americans into debt slaves and and and a
[3:02:18.480 --> 3:02:25.480]  very very few fabulously wealthy and this latest economic crisis has
[3:02:25.480 --> 3:02:29.480]  accelerated the process the banks abuse their their money and their
[3:02:29.480 --> 3:02:37.480]  political influence it buys to obtain the $700 billion bailout which
[3:02:37.480 --> 3:02:42.480]  they're using to consolidate wealth even faster and right now we have no
[3:02:42.480 --> 3:02:50.480]  politician is in a position of power to resist it so it's a it's a sea
[3:02:50.480 --> 3:02:54.480]  change that's going on it's not totally new as I said it's been going on
[3:02:54.480 --> 3:02:59.480]  to since 1913 and meanwhile the subsidiaries of this small group of
[3:02:59.480 --> 3:03:02.480]  private banking families that bought control of the British and US
[3:03:02.480 --> 3:03:09.480]  government in the last 200 years they are carrying out a similar process to
[3:03:09.480 --> 3:03:13.480]  what they've done in third world countries where they come in give them
[3:03:13.480 --> 3:03:16.480]  loans at 20 30% tell the leaders not to pay it off just hand over the
[3:03:16.480 --> 3:03:20.480]  resources and then enslave the people and if a government ever tries to resist
[3:03:20.480 --> 3:03:24.480]  that they go with the military and police and stage a coup or have the
[3:03:24.480 --> 3:03:28.480]  neighbor attack them and openly finance it and the IMF and World Bank and
[3:03:28.480 --> 3:03:32.480]  even the private you know deburrers Oppenheimer Diamond monopoly they
[3:03:32.480 --> 3:03:37.480]  brag they hire mercenaries and cougs I mean this small group of global
[3:03:37.480 --> 3:03:40.480]  families less than a hundred in the banking it's only four or five big
[3:03:40.480 --> 3:03:46.480]  ones I mean you know while their CEOs are making 500 million a year they
[3:03:46.480 --> 3:03:51.480]  are leveraging trillions and trillions and have created a tsunami of fiat
[3:03:51.480 --> 3:03:55.480]  currency that they are buying up the world with while at the same time
[3:03:55.480 --> 3:03:58.480]  devaluing the currency of everybody that's saved and then telling us we've
[3:03:58.480 --> 3:04:03.480]  got to pay in taxes pay off all of this fiat currency they created I mean it is
[3:04:03.480 --> 3:04:11.480]  so diabolical and folks you've seen nothing yet the hyperinflation 25 30%
[3:04:11.480 --> 3:04:15.480]  by next year compounding 15% a year right now you've already lost half your

[3:09:57.480 --> 3:10:01.480]  ahead with the rest of your I'm not in our literature for instance in other words
[3:10:01.480 --> 3:10:06.480]  well that claim of it of it being incorporated in Delaware has been found
[3:10:06.480 --> 3:10:10.480]  to be a similar corporate name but not accurate but it does operate as a
[3:10:10.480 --> 3:10:15.480]  corporation just like chartered cities do but but go ahead well that's correct yeah
[3:10:15.480 --> 3:10:22.480]  well let's go I was listening to Jim Percy the other day on the power hour and
[3:10:22.480 --> 3:10:29.480]  I'd heard this term before and I did some more research and he also brought up the
[3:10:29.480 --> 3:10:38.080]  fact that all courts operate under Admiralty's law and that's why they have
[3:10:38.080 --> 3:10:43.200]  the flag with the gold fringe and gold tassel hanging in it because it's the
[3:10:43.200 --> 3:10:46.980]  Constitution is not in effect in their court that the judge more or less goes
[3:10:46.980 --> 3:10:52.680]  about whatever rule he feels get to enforce this correct well there's a
[3:10:52.680 --> 3:10:57.760]  lot of sort esoteric theories like that that I'm not where is it going with
[3:10:57.760 --> 3:11:01.920]  what are you trying to do with with this theory defend yourself from what well
[3:11:01.920 --> 3:11:08.480]  it's it's not about constitutional law it's all about corporation law well he
[3:11:08.480 --> 3:11:12.480]  I mean he was an administrative law judge so he could specifically speak to
[3:11:12.480 --> 3:11:16.920]  that well are you being what what is are you talking about is this concerning
[3:11:16.920 --> 3:11:21.720]  taxes or what is it your taxes I'm talking about the mortgages contracts
[3:11:21.720 --> 3:11:30.480]  your injury into as far as mortgages when the state federal government files
[3:11:30.480 --> 3:11:35.160]  charges against you or you're brought into law under spina whatever it's all
[3:11:35.160 --> 3:11:40.480]  in capital letters well let me let me go to the straw man let me say this and
[3:11:40.480 --> 3:11:46.720]  Alex actually probably better for about this than I am my the information I have
[3:11:46.720 --> 3:11:53.200]  about the use of these you know various esoteric theories about of them of the
[3:11:53.200 --> 3:11:57.680]  sort that you're mentioning is they're generally unsuccessful and there have
[3:11:57.680 --> 3:12:04.680]  been a few cases where they have been successful but very few so first off you
[3:12:04.680 --> 3:12:07.680]  have to be prepared to suffer the consequences if you're not successful
[3:12:07.680 --> 3:12:12.760]  so you know I would say you look and I appreciate your call sir let me comment
[3:12:12.760 --> 3:12:19.320]  on this generally there we call it patriot mythology and I've seen a lot
[3:12:19.320 --> 3:12:23.280]  of friends and neighbors people didn't listen to me going back 12 14 years go
[3:12:23.280 --> 3:12:29.600]  to prison or lose their houses over this instead of attacking the corrupt system
[3:12:29.600 --> 3:12:32.880]  through the Constitution the Bill of Rights them violating their own codes
[3:12:32.880 --> 3:12:36.320]  and procedures which they tend to follow more than the Constitution Bill of
[3:12:36.320 --> 3:12:41.840]  Rights itself and instead of using areas where they violated their own rules you
[3:12:41.840 --> 3:12:45.960]  know there's all sorts of people with the straw men and the all-caps and and it's
[3:12:45.960 --> 3:12:51.520]  just pure baloney now now it is true that the flag means Admiralty and that
[3:12:51.520 --> 3:12:54.920]  there is Admiralty law and I've seen federal cases where they're seizing
[3:12:54.920 --> 3:12:59.120]  people's property in federal court and saying we're doing this under Admiralty
[3:12:59.120 --> 3:13:03.920]  and and and look I mean here's an example there is total lawlessness say
[3:13:03.920 --> 3:13:07.400]  100 years ago with Pinkerton security hired by the Rockefellers there was
[3:13:07.400 --> 3:13:10.800]  hundreds of cases of this just for them alone where people would have a title to
[3:13:10.800 --> 3:13:15.280]  a goldmine there'd be a squatters camp living there with the deed that they
[3:13:15.280 --> 3:13:19.200]  got from say forest land out in the territory they just ride in and kill
[3:13:19.200 --> 3:13:21.920]  everybody and then nobody's gonna stand up against Rockefeller because you know
[3:13:21.920 --> 3:13:26.760]  he owns Congress and he owns the local governor he'd have certain states where
[3:13:26.760 --> 3:13:29.400]  they did own the governor where they would just kill and mow down whole
[3:13:29.400 --> 3:13:34.360]  families and just murder everybody and take land water rights so so so it is
[3:13:34.360 --> 3:13:38.960]  lawless and then you got brainwash cops that don't even know which end is up the
[3:13:38.960 --> 3:13:42.000]  public doesn't know anything doesn't even know the Federal Reserve's private and
[3:13:42.000 --> 3:13:45.480]  so you do have a lot of rampant corruption saying you got to take
[3:13:45.480 --> 3:13:50.080]  inoculations there's no law to do that just writing parents tickets for their
[3:13:50.080 --> 3:13:54.080]  child talking in class when there's not even something in the statutes I mean we
[3:13:54.080 --> 3:14:00.240]  have a lawless rogue color of law baboon government at the local level but
[3:14:00.240 --> 3:14:03.880]  that's by design the system hires baboons you know they hire you know they
[3:14:03.880 --> 3:14:07.480]  hire thugs and criminals but I'm just in people get mad at me every time I say
[3:14:07.480 --> 3:14:12.360]  these you know these these these patriot mythologies are at best very
[3:14:12.360 --> 3:14:16.760]  dangerous because let's say they there's some grain of truth in them you're not
[3:14:16.760 --> 3:14:19.960]  going to know how to implement them and I see people get torn up and torn up now
[3:14:19.960 --> 3:14:23.280]  finally people have thanked me you know 10 years later because now it's kind of
[3:14:23.280 --> 3:14:27.200]  washed itself out with the public seeing enough people being torn apart but I
[3:14:27.200 --> 3:14:30.520]  don't want to spend all day on them with the other calls but do you agree with
[3:14:30.520 --> 3:14:36.400]  that statement yeah let's let's go ahead and take another call here and I'm
[3:14:36.400 --> 3:14:39.560]  sorry folks I just can't buy into the baloney I just can't send people to
[3:14:39.560 --> 3:14:43.560]  prison I just can't be part of hurting people I just can't do it a lot people
[3:14:43.560 --> 3:14:48.920]  get mad at me for that but that's okay let's go ahead and talk to Russ in
[3:14:48.920 --> 3:14:56.920]  Minnesota Russ thanks for holding her on the air yeah well I'm a first time
[3:14:56.920 --> 3:15:01.760]  car but I've been now listening to show for the last three years and the last
[3:15:01.760 --> 3:15:06.280]  couple years I've been telling my family and friends that the stock market was
[3:15:06.280 --> 3:15:10.160]  inflated and that we're heading toward the crash and for those that didn't
[3:15:10.160 --> 3:15:14.320]  listen they lost you know tens of thousands of dollars and now when I talk
[3:15:14.320 --> 3:15:19.120]  to people they have the mindset that well okay the crash but it'll it'll go
[3:15:19.120 --> 3:15:25.680]  back up and so when I look at like back in 1913 the Dow Jones of that like 60
[3:15:25.680 --> 3:15:30.760]  and now it's you know around 8,000 something so my question to you is you
[3:15:30.760 --> 3:15:38.040]  guys are you know the price of gold or gold as a commodity maintains its
[3:15:38.040 --> 3:15:42.480]  value but when someone invests in the stock market over the long haul does
[3:15:42.480 --> 3:15:48.400]  that maintain its value well it sort of depends on what time period you look at
[3:15:48.400 --> 3:15:53.880]  it was kind of interesting but in recent years you know stock brokers have
[3:15:53.880 --> 3:15:58.960]  used when one time period doesn't work they make it longer or shorter as the
[3:15:58.960 --> 3:16:05.400]  case may be to make it attractive so certainly over time it measured in simple
[3:16:05.400 --> 3:16:11.160]  dollar terms it has gone up but you have to remove the inflation factor to find
[3:16:11.160 --> 3:16:14.960]  out you know real value and that's been done the stock market really has an
[3:16:14.960 --> 3:16:19.240]  increase in value it's actually lost value if you remove inflation from the
[3:16:19.240 --> 3:16:25.080]  equation is that what you found sir well I mean what I'm asking is for people
[3:16:25.080 --> 3:16:29.520]  that have lost money recently is the mindset that it'll go back up and
[3:16:29.520 --> 3:16:32.920]  everything's gonna be okay is that is that relevant I mean does the stock market
[3:16:32.920 --> 3:16:35.840]  increase let me tell you what's relevant let me tell you what's relevant
[3:16:35.840 --> 3:16:39.800]  we're gonna we're seeing the biggest hopper inflation in US history since
[3:16:39.800 --> 3:16:43.400]  right after its founding they had one just as bad then we're seeing the worst
[3:16:43.400 --> 3:16:47.960]  hyperinflation ever coming it's already here but it's gonna get a lot worse and
[3:16:47.960 --> 3:16:51.800]  so people are going to dump it basically everything they've got to get out of the
[3:16:51.800 --> 3:16:55.840]  market and they're only gonna have the big institutions that inflated the
[3:16:55.840 --> 3:16:58.960]  currency to get flush and cash who are gonna be able to come in and buy it up
[3:16:58.960 --> 3:17:04.760]  but mr. Carmack you agree with that yeah I do you know obviously that they are
[3:17:04.760 --> 3:17:09.400]  creating money at a very rapid rate we all know that the government numbers
[3:17:09.400 --> 3:17:14.760]  the CPI have you know one to two percent inflation nonsense and that's
[3:17:14.760 --> 3:17:18.320]  another form of wealth wealth transfer has reduced the social security payments
[3:17:18.320 --> 3:17:23.200]  and it's used for you know for union contract yeah that's the key people on
[3:17:23.200 --> 3:17:26.000]  fixed incomes by the way are the ones that are really gonna get hammered to go
[3:17:26.000 --> 3:17:30.720]  ahead yeah so I mean you might see values go up but inflation is gonna
[3:17:30.720 --> 3:17:35.120]  probably go up even faster so you have to factor that out when you make your
[3:17:35.120 --> 3:17:38.720]  calculations about the stock market in the first place only anybody quite knows
[3:17:38.720 --> 3:17:44.320]  yet how far down it's gonna go and then how long it's gonna be down you know
[3:17:44.320 --> 3:17:49.960]  this is a very profound economic crisis that's happened most the money's on 10
[3:17:49.960 --> 3:17:55.640]  to 15 years like Japan yeah so so you know if you're looking for sort of
[3:17:55.640 --> 3:17:59.520]  indirect advice on how to invest I can't give it to you I you know these
[3:17:59.520 --> 3:18:03.360]  things haven't worked themselves out yet yeah folks if you're mega flush in all
[3:18:03.360 --> 3:18:07.640]  sorts of assets and diversified you invest all day but people that have
[3:18:07.640 --> 3:18:11.600]  gotten to that position generally unless it's through inheritance you know what
[3:18:11.600 --> 3:18:16.480]  you need to do yourself you know your own position but for other folks you need
[3:18:16.480 --> 3:18:24.280]  to you know get down to basics and prepare for really hard times ahead but
[3:18:24.280 --> 3:18:27.560]  listen the general public's gonna stay on the stock market till that thing goes
[3:18:27.560 --> 3:18:31.600]  all the way down the globalists are completely ruthless they want to drive
[3:18:31.600 --> 3:18:37.280]  it down so I would say in the next year I I'll say right now I think the stock
[3:18:37.280 --> 3:18:40.760]  market's going down to below five thousand it may go even lower and then
[3:18:40.760 --> 3:18:43.760]  after they buy it all up it's gonna go back up again but then you're gonna have
[3:18:43.760 --> 3:18:49.280]  hyperinflation on top of that Pat well yeah I you know it's it's a pretty safe
[3:18:49.280 --> 3:18:55.560]  bet it's an eventually gonna go back up again and so you know but and and it's
[3:18:55.560 --> 3:18:59.040]  obvious we're going to have very high levels of inflation for the next few
[3:18:59.040 --> 3:19:06.280]  years absolutely I mean we mean brutal brutal brutal did that answer your
[3:19:06.280 --> 3:19:10.640]  question Russ yeah I just think people right now are still in denial that
[3:19:10.640 --> 3:19:14.920]  everything's gonna be fine and don't see the big picture yeah well I don't know
[3:19:14.920 --> 3:19:17.920]  how much denial there and they're realizing the banker takeovers a big

[3:24:01.280 --> 3:24:07.360]  forget Ron Paul was on the start of the show today with a lot of key info let's
[3:24:07.360 --> 3:24:10.360]  go ahead and go to mark in Oregon that you're on the air with the producer of
[3:24:10.360 --> 3:24:15.520]  the Money Masters Pat Carmack go ahead yeah good afternoon Alex and Pat
[3:24:15.520 --> 3:24:20.840]  after that Alex I did want to mention you real quick about if you have the need
[3:24:20.840 --> 3:24:26.240]  any time in the rest of your life to have a beer you're not drink any of the
[3:24:26.240 --> 3:24:30.680]  popular American brands because they all have formaldehyde in them to
[3:24:30.680 --> 3:24:35.000]  accelerate the fermentation process and cut down the production cost I know
[3:24:35.000 --> 3:24:38.240]  they have a lot of bad chemicals in them Budweiser isn't even brewed anymore it's
[3:24:38.240 --> 3:24:45.040]  a syrup added to carbonated water yeah well definitely affect your health
[3:24:45.040 --> 3:24:50.680]  adversely you know in a real quick way you know Pat I was wondering if you could
[3:24:50.680 --> 3:24:55.000]  extrapolate for me a little bit being as your well-versed in the in the
[3:24:55.000 --> 3:25:02.360]  economic structure nationally and on a global level it would seem to me if you
[3:25:02.360 --> 3:25:08.720]  could basically kind of look down the timeline a little bit given that we have
[3:25:08.720 --> 3:25:15.760]  a it's already been put into law as far as this whole reformation of the global
[3:25:15.760 --> 3:25:21.120]  economy and how the United States is basically funding it and where are we
[3:25:21.120 --> 3:25:25.000]  going to be at per se in the United States being at the at on the bottom
[3:25:25.000 --> 3:25:29.480]  rung of the ladder of all of this basically as far as our welfare on a
[3:25:29.480 --> 3:25:33.000]  financial level goes where we're going to be two or three or four months down
[3:25:33.000 --> 3:25:36.600]  the line from here how will this tremendous iceberg surface in our
[3:25:36.600 --> 3:25:41.960]  reality on an economic level here thus affecting our quality of life what
[3:25:41.960 --> 3:25:45.560]  would what would be the different aspect well I would just say we're going to be
[3:25:45.560 --> 3:25:49.640]  fully drained to build the New World Order and then the and then the building
[3:25:49.640 --> 3:25:52.920]  of it we're going to be blamed for so we're going to be turning to a third
[3:25:52.920 --> 3:25:59.240]  world country a cesspit of police state to to to rule over the slaves and then
[3:25:59.240 --> 3:26:04.840]  it's such an important question I'm putting out my answer and then we'll
[3:26:04.840 --> 3:26:08.600]  also again not just pay for the new order but then be hated and be blamed
[3:26:08.600 --> 3:26:15.800]  for the crises that they then build their new order out of Pat well if I
[3:26:15.800 --> 3:26:20.000]  understand the question correctly you know looking three to four months ahead
[3:26:20.000 --> 3:26:24.840]  I don't think anybody no matter what side of this issue their own things things
[3:26:24.840 --> 3:26:28.160]  are going to be dramatically better even a little better it's gonna be worse
[3:26:28.160 --> 3:26:33.160]  obviously we're gonna see unemployment rise inflation is going to go up
[3:26:33.160 --> 3:26:39.680]  considerably more than it is now I think you're gonna see probably the stock
[3:26:39.680 --> 3:26:43.400]  market continue to decline and so forth and you're going to see the Fed
[3:26:43.400 --> 3:26:52.120]  spending hundreds of billions giving much of it to major banks that the
[3:26:52.120 --> 3:26:57.320]  Fed's creating I mean the money they're creating and that's gonna obviously
[3:26:57.320 --> 3:27:02.020]  fuel inflation as well and and it and it decreases the value of everyone else's
[3:27:02.020 --> 3:27:06.480]  money to the benefit of the major banks that are receiving those funds so you
[3:27:06.480 --> 3:27:11.720]  know there's not much you know happy news in the in the near term that I think
[3:27:11.720 --> 3:27:18.200]  anybody would predict the housing crisis is probably going to worsen you know
[3:27:18.200 --> 3:27:26.040]  there's various kinds of subprime I forget what they call them re read
[3:27:26.040 --> 3:27:33.200]  adjustment readjustments yeah yeah that don't even peak till 2011 so we've got
[3:27:33.200 --> 3:27:37.440]  credit card that's around a trillion coming do and people are defaulting
[3:27:37.440 --> 3:27:42.600]  record levels we have car loans business loans default default default you
[3:27:42.600 --> 3:27:46.920]  ain't seen nothing yet folks so I think you want to be conservative about things
[3:27:46.920 --> 3:27:52.640]  and you know it's not a time to go to debt or make it you know you know stick
[3:27:52.640 --> 3:27:58.440]  your neck out financially because you may need the money and I think those are
[3:27:58.440 --> 3:28:03.720]  pretty safe statements to make a response to your question anything else
[3:28:03.720 --> 3:28:07.680]  great show one other thing I think it'll take an act of God basically to
[3:28:07.680 --> 3:28:14.040]  straighten this one out Alex but again thank you thank you people think the
[3:28:14.040 --> 3:28:17.040]  drug war is failing it's an incredible success they ship it in they put your
[3:28:17.040 --> 3:28:19.880]  kids in prison and private prison owned by the banks that launder the drug
[3:28:19.880 --> 3:28:25.640]  money people think the war you know on on on illiteracy is going horribly no I
[3:28:25.640 --> 3:28:28.840]  have all the federal documents about the former you had a policy department
[3:28:28.840 --> 3:28:31.880]  education on where they were openly there to dump everybody down and I have
[3:28:31.880 --> 3:28:35.400]  the banking association documents in their public letter from over a hundred
[3:28:35.400 --> 3:28:39.400]  years ago saying we got to dump people down we got to buy up the the you know
[3:28:39.400 --> 3:28:44.120]  the schools the newspapers and dumb them down these people are too smart to be
[3:28:44.120 --> 3:28:50.240]  able to be enslaved and so you know the education's doing a great job that's
[3:28:50.240 --> 3:28:53.880]  dumb them down drug war is great more drugs more people in prison than ever
[3:28:53.880 --> 3:28:58.840]  I mean this is this is their business folks these are cold-blooded people with
[3:28:58.840 --> 3:29:03.640]  military minds Pat you agree with that statement well I think that there's no
[3:29:03.640 --> 3:29:06.920]  question the American people have been dumped down and we need to return to
[3:29:06.920 --> 3:29:11.640]  classical education like the founders had in it you know they understood what
[3:29:11.640 --> 3:29:14.080]  was happening because they were well educated hold on I'm gonna skip this
[3:29:14.080 --> 3:29:17.520]  break for the info wars listeners and present planet on TV folks so plenty of
[3:29:17.520 --> 3:29:22.200]  time to finish up with you stay with us we're on the mark the Empire is on the
[3:29:22.200 --> 3:29:26.680]  run it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network okay yeah Pat we're just on the
[3:29:26.680 --> 3:29:33.560]  web right now but that's a substantive audience I want to let you continue what
[3:29:33.560 --> 3:29:37.720]  you were saying go ahead well you know like there's even a I think it's a
[3:29:37.720 --> 3:29:41.280]  homeschool program now called the Jefferson education or something that
[3:29:41.280 --> 3:29:46.120]  kind and people back then were actually well educated literacy rates were
[3:29:46.120 --> 3:29:51.560]  considerably higher in the late 1700s 1800s in the United States our
[3:29:51.560 --> 3:29:56.120]  educational system is a complete bust and that you know in a way that's our
[3:29:56.120 --> 3:30:01.800]  problem because when they never could have pulled off for instance this bailout
[3:30:01.800 --> 3:30:06.280]  or any of these other horrible you know changes in laws that are happening in
[3:30:06.280 --> 3:30:10.680]  modern times if people were well educated they're able to just lie to the
[3:30:10.680 --> 3:30:15.240]  people misdescribe misrepresent what's happening and everyone just accepts it
[3:30:15.240 --> 3:30:20.760]  you know and they accept what they see on TV and so nobody's reading anymore so
[3:30:20.760 --> 3:30:26.960]  you know the lack of education is it's it's really one of the roots of this
[3:30:26.960 --> 3:30:33.520]  problem and it goes back to all the way back to when we begin mass education in
[3:30:33.520 --> 3:30:37.480]  this country which by the way was subsequently heavily financed by the
[3:30:37.480 --> 3:30:41.200]  bank because they said they saw an opportunity to use it not to educate but
[3:30:41.200 --> 3:30:46.880]  to make sure people were not educated there is a movement you know homeschooling
[3:30:46.880 --> 3:30:51.560]  part of it by the way in the United States to restore authentic education in
[3:30:51.560 --> 3:30:56.800]  the United States and that's already got over two million students that are
[3:30:56.800 --> 3:31:03.120]  being home educated and so the establishment is countering in California
[3:31:03.120 --> 3:31:08.040]  they came out what five months ago with a ruling and it said the state to me I
[3:31:08.040 --> 3:31:12.960]  mean I read the the state ruling here on air it said the state I mean there's
[3:31:12.960 --> 3:31:16.520]  statements like you know it's it's improperly believe he's not even
[3:31:16.520 --> 3:31:20.440]  findings in law it just it just sounds like mumbo jumbo from a social worker
[3:31:20.440 --> 3:31:25.920]  you know that that the state has no you know job parenting but that's not true
[3:31:25.920 --> 3:31:30.160]  the state basically is the parent and if you don't have a full teaching
[3:31:30.160 --> 3:31:35.480]  certificate specifically a degree in teaching you can homeschool and they're
[3:31:35.480 --> 3:31:39.200]  trying that in other parts of the world and other parts of the US and on its
[3:31:39.200 --> 3:31:47.200]  face homeschoolers in college interest exams in high school exit exams
[3:31:47.200 --> 3:31:54.600]  efficiency exams in everything they show in the spelling bees in geography
[3:31:54.600 --> 3:31:59.240]  bees the homeschoolers are as a group you know not just the crème de la crème
[3:31:59.240 --> 3:32:03.960]  but the entire group themselves of the crème they are the crème of the crème
[3:32:03.960 --> 3:32:08.080]  and what I'm saying is not just the top of the homeschooler but the entire body
[3:32:08.080 --> 3:32:13.160]  and so the the establishment sees that as a threat and they call CPS on them
[3:32:13.160 --> 3:32:19.000]  and and and and you know the state is honing in with vicious abandon directly
[3:32:19.000 --> 3:32:23.080]  on that institution as it grows as we go from a million homeschoolers are closer
[3:32:23.080 --> 3:32:25.960]  to three million now it's growing exponentially and we're gonna go back
[3:32:25.960 --> 3:32:30.000]  live on the full audience on your comment on that here we go
[3:32:32.120 --> 3:32:36.440]  for those that are listening on the M&M shortwave satellite we were just talking
[3:32:36.440 --> 3:32:39.880]  about education being the key and how by design they've done the children down
[3:32:39.880 --> 3:32:44.720]  we've got millions of homeschoolers now it's growing exponentially so California
[3:32:44.720 --> 3:32:48.760]  is banning homeschooling it's totally criminal the state doesn't own your
[3:32:48.760 --> 3:32:52.400]  children but but again that this is the manifestation of true tyranny and I wanted
[3:32:52.400 --> 3:32:59.880]  to get Mr. Carmack judge Carmack former bank president Carmack's comment on the
[3:32:59.880 --> 3:33:01.480]  statement I just made
[3:33:01.480 --> 3:33:05.880]  well actually uh... that it that was the status of that case but in California
[3:33:05.880 --> 3:33:10.920]  that the same court reversed itself unanimously as I heard
[3:33:10.920 --> 3:33:13.960]  uh... at all that's good news also it was a fraud
[3:33:13.960 --> 3:33:17.080]  yeah the uh... they ruled actually that uh...
[3:33:17.080 --> 3:33:21.720]  uh... families are an effective form of private schools which which made them
[3:33:21.720 --> 3:33:23.880]  therefore comply with the law
[3:33:23.880 --> 3:33:26.800]  because the law required that it's been school
[3:33:26.800 --> 3:33:30.680]  and so in California that was successfully uh... beat back in fact
[3:33:30.680 --> 3:33:34.640]  governor Schwarzenegger actually supported the homeschoolers in that
[3:33:34.640 --> 3:33:39.160]  and so so did the homeschool legal defense association which is a very fine
[3:33:39.160 --> 3:33:40.920]  organization uh...
[3:33:40.920 --> 3:33:44.200]  that defense homeschooling across the united states
[3:33:44.200 --> 3:33:45.160]  uh...
[3:33:45.160 --> 3:33:46.160]  and uh...
[3:33:46.160 --> 3:33:47.720]  has helped uh...
[3:33:47.720 --> 3:33:49.680]  defeat efforts by
[3:33:49.680 --> 3:33:52.880]  the teachers union see people think i know everything i get emails every day
[3:33:52.880 --> 3:33:54.240]  why do you report on this
[3:33:54.240 --> 3:33:56.160]  why do you cover that you're covering it up
[3:33:56.160 --> 3:33:59.680]  no i'm not over there's so much happening that none of us know what all
[3:33:59.680 --> 3:34:00.800]  folks in fact
[3:34:00.800 --> 3:34:03.840]  i know very little that's what freaks me out
[3:34:03.840 --> 3:34:07.520]  well i you were certainly right right though about homeschooling expanding
[3:34:07.520 --> 3:34:10.000]  it is definitely an exponential uh...
[3:34:10.000 --> 3:34:14.400]  expansion uh... and not only that the quality of it has gone up dramatically
[3:34:14.400 --> 3:34:15.760]  you know originally
[3:34:15.760 --> 3:34:16.880]  people uh...
[3:34:16.880 --> 3:34:18.840]  basically back in the eighties
[3:34:18.840 --> 3:34:21.960]  in large numbers begin to bail out of the schools because of the violence
[3:34:21.960 --> 3:34:25.080]  problems and the moral problems and drugs and
[3:34:25.080 --> 3:34:29.680]  and also the decline in the academic quality of the curriculum and so forth
[3:34:29.680 --> 3:34:33.720]  and a column by made it explode i think it was a net ninety eight or ninety nine
[3:34:33.720 --> 3:34:37.480]  and that's what's changing things now is that ten twenty years ago there weren't
[3:34:37.480 --> 3:34:38.720]  these huge communities
[3:34:38.720 --> 3:34:41.600]  here in austin were right at the point of the make the decision
[3:34:41.600 --> 3:34:44.000]  uh... whether the homeschool or not
[3:34:44.000 --> 3:34:47.320]  or or go to private school right if we can afford that
[3:34:47.320 --> 3:34:50.200]  just because it's you know quote easier on us we know we probably should just go
[3:34:50.200 --> 3:34:52.680]  ahead and go that route but i won't be able to work as much as we have we do
[3:34:52.680 --> 3:34:54.200]  that we have the bigger fight
[3:34:54.200 --> 3:34:55.120]  but but but
[3:34:55.120 --> 3:34:58.760]  it's now there's the soccer leagues in baseball and groups and they're so
[3:34:58.760 --> 3:35:00.680]  diverse in so many choices
[3:35:00.680 --> 3:35:04.120]  that community that core community growing getting back
[3:35:04.120 --> 3:35:07.480]  to true communities that is scaring the controllers
[3:35:07.480 --> 3:35:11.720]  well and actually statistic show the homeschoolers engage in more social
[3:35:11.720 --> 3:35:13.080]  activities
[3:35:13.080 --> 3:35:15.880]  of the various kinds you've mentioned others
[3:35:15.880 --> 3:35:16.600]  uh...
[3:35:16.600 --> 3:35:20.280]  then kids who are in either private or public school they also academically
[3:35:20.280 --> 3:35:22.720]  outperform private school students now
[3:35:22.720 --> 3:35:25.680]  yeah on average they spend about two and a half hours but it's real
[3:35:25.680 --> 3:35:28.760]  learning in the classical method that where everybody learned in log cabins
[3:35:28.760 --> 3:35:29.840]  and became president
[3:35:29.840 --> 3:35:31.520]  and engineers before
[3:35:31.520 --> 3:35:35.440]  uh... and uh... then the rest of time they go out and have fun
[3:35:35.440 --> 3:35:38.440]  well that's right and you know the greeks didn't begin really formal
[3:35:38.440 --> 3:35:42.080]  schooling until about seven years of age because
[3:35:42.080 --> 3:35:47.120]  early on kids really do need the raw experience with the nature you know they
[3:35:47.120 --> 3:35:48.080]  need to see
[3:35:48.080 --> 3:35:52.600]  frogs in a stream and not see a picture of a frog in a stream in a book
[3:35:52.600 --> 3:35:56.320]  and uh... they learn much more effectively that way early on it provides
[3:35:56.320 --> 3:35:57.920]  the raw material
[3:35:57.920 --> 3:36:01.400]  subsequent analyst right children need to be out very young seeing people bail
[3:36:01.400 --> 3:36:02.120]  hey
[3:36:02.120 --> 3:36:04.280]  planning gardens fishing
[3:36:04.280 --> 3:36:07.400]  uh... boxing you know wrestling
[3:36:07.400 --> 3:36:10.440]  that's what they need of course a four-year-old can't understand those
[3:36:10.440 --> 3:36:13.880]  things analytically and that of course that's precisely why the government
[3:36:13.880 --> 3:36:17.920]  increasingly you know i've adopted the kindergarten model from germany
[3:36:17.920 --> 3:36:20.840]  which ultimately came from prussian militarism
[3:36:20.840 --> 3:36:24.240]  and why they would like to go earlier earlier take the kids out of their
[3:36:24.240 --> 3:36:27.360]  families and put them in a concrete box all day
[3:36:27.360 --> 3:36:30.520]  you don't learn anything in a concrete box at that age you can't
[3:36:30.520 --> 3:36:35.320]  man i tell you pat you are just an amazing guy love generalist and and
[3:36:35.320 --> 3:36:38.200]  everything you're saying is you know all the basic research i've done many
[3:36:38.200 --> 3:36:39.920]  others have done it's it's
[3:36:39.920 --> 3:36:43.040]  uh... you're a multi-faceted guy and i know a lot of people are but it's really
[3:36:43.040 --> 3:36:44.600]  great to talk to somebody that's really
[3:36:44.600 --> 3:36:45.960]  really knows what's going on
[3:36:45.960 --> 3:36:48.240]  well actually i'm i'm a president of uh...
[3:36:48.240 --> 3:36:51.480]  of the home school a national home school program
[3:36:51.480 --> 3:36:55.200]  so it's an area i am interested in it's called a great books academy
[3:36:55.200 --> 3:36:56.640]  uh... it's online
[3:36:56.640 --> 3:36:57.800]  dot org
[3:36:57.800 --> 3:36:59.400]  and uh...
[3:36:59.400 --> 3:37:01.200]  uh...
[3:37:01.200 --> 3:37:04.040]  yeah it's an area i'm very interested because it's part of solution to this
[3:37:04.040 --> 3:37:05.240]  the uh...
[3:37:05.240 --> 3:37:09.440]  the economic problem uh... is is in fact rooted in people not being able to
[3:37:09.440 --> 3:37:11.800]  understand what's happening to them
[3:37:11.800 --> 3:37:14.520]  let's take a few final calls um...
[3:37:14.520 --> 3:37:16.640]  who is up next year i've got so many on the list
[3:37:16.640 --> 3:37:19.440]  i think in new york i think in new york you're on the air with our guest go
[3:37:19.440 --> 3:37:20.560]  ahead
[3:37:20.560 --> 3:37:22.620]  hey
[3:37:22.620 --> 3:37:24.080]  uh...
[3:37:24.080 --> 3:37:25.240]  hello
[3:37:25.240 --> 3:37:26.480]  um...
[3:37:26.480 --> 3:37:30.400]  i was calling to i heard you before on regard about the preachers
[3:37:30.400 --> 3:37:32.560]  getting the money took well-descent
[3:37:32.560 --> 3:37:35.280]  and i wanted to uh...
[3:37:35.280 --> 3:37:36.920]  bring right to uh...
[3:37:36.920 --> 3:37:39.640]  couple weeks ago i without a church event
[3:37:39.640 --> 3:37:42.240]  and basically the preacher started relating
[3:37:42.240 --> 3:37:43.480]  story
[3:37:43.480 --> 3:37:48.280]  about in the legal immigration and how people were
[3:37:48.280 --> 3:37:51.160]  upset about losing jobs and complaining
[3:37:51.160 --> 3:37:53.840]  and basically he went into a story about how
[3:37:53.840 --> 3:37:56.160]  a man had a field
[3:37:56.160 --> 3:37:57.840]  he hired workers
[3:37:57.840 --> 3:38:01.120]  and some people started later in the day and at the end of the day
[3:38:01.120 --> 3:38:02.760]  they were upset because
[3:38:02.760 --> 3:38:03.780]  they got paid
[3:38:03.780 --> 3:38:04.760]  the same
[3:38:04.760 --> 3:38:06.800]  as the workers who started
[3:38:06.800 --> 3:38:08.840]  later
[3:38:08.840 --> 3:38:10.800]  and i just thought it was weird
[3:38:10.800 --> 3:38:13.760]  look there's a bunch of liberation there's a bunch of liberation
[3:38:13.760 --> 3:38:18.640]  theology we call it communism but it's not in the bank's fund
[3:38:18.640 --> 3:38:20.320]  this socialism
[3:38:20.320 --> 3:38:23.880]  uh... and and and and they teach you turn your guns in
[3:38:23.880 --> 3:38:26.360]  they've hired twenty six thousand preachers we exposes year and a half
[3:38:26.360 --> 3:38:27.960]  before was mainstream news
[3:38:27.960 --> 3:38:31.240]  we got the secret female documents from a pastor but spotted and we covered it
[3:38:31.240 --> 3:38:32.120]  here
[3:38:32.120 --> 3:38:35.440]  and uh... they have them to do i mean literally going off government
[3:38:35.440 --> 3:38:37.240]  scripts and being paid
[3:38:37.240 --> 3:38:41.040]  and that that is a total turning on all of us pat
[3:38:41.040 --> 3:38:42.680]  well obviously uh...
[3:38:42.680 --> 3:38:45.800]  your religion is a tremendously important source
[3:38:45.800 --> 3:38:46.840]  you know uh...
[3:38:46.840 --> 3:38:48.560]  inspiration and ultimately
[3:38:48.560 --> 3:38:51.920]  you know it inspires political action and they know that so
[3:38:51.920 --> 3:38:54.760]  they're going to try to corrupt that just as they have the media just that
[3:38:54.760 --> 3:38:56.800]  they have the educational system
[3:38:56.800 --> 3:38:58.920]  uh... the political system so
[3:38:58.920 --> 3:39:04.000]  which one has to keep one's eyes out for you know anything like that that uh...
[3:39:04.000 --> 3:39:06.440]  is not uh...
[3:39:06.440 --> 3:39:08.800]  that raises one's eyebrows
[3:39:08.800 --> 3:39:10.000]  match
[3:39:10.000 --> 3:39:10.680]  you know the truth
[3:39:10.680 --> 3:39:14.000]  yeah folks your children are the greatest treasure in the world they teach
[3:39:14.000 --> 3:39:15.560]  you it's horrible to have children
[3:39:15.560 --> 3:39:18.080]  they teach you it's a hassle they teach you it's terrible
[3:39:18.080 --> 3:39:21.040]  uh... when really it's the best it's the best thing in the world and it's part
[3:39:21.040 --> 3:39:22.840]  of our life cycle were meant to
[3:39:22.840 --> 3:39:24.120]  being families
[3:39:24.120 --> 3:39:26.560]  and that's why the state who wants the utopia
[3:39:26.560 --> 3:39:29.480]  says that destroy the family first and that's in all the government documents
[3:39:29.480 --> 3:39:30.720]  it's total wickedness
[3:39:30.720 --> 3:39:33.280]  the government is bankrupt in evil period
[3:39:33.280 --> 3:39:34.720]  we have to come out of it
[3:39:34.720 --> 3:39:36.640]  we have to create our own communities
[3:39:36.640 --> 3:39:38.320]  we have to be centralized
[3:39:38.320 --> 3:39:39.720]  not centralized
[3:39:39.720 --> 3:39:41.160]  that is what is going to stop
[3:39:41.160 --> 3:39:43.560]  uh... terny that will never be a utopia
[3:39:43.560 --> 3:39:46.920]  but i appreciate uh... your call i think scott in arizona

[3:39:56.640 --> 3:39:57.600]  today good
[3:39:57.600 --> 3:39:58.800]  great awesome awesome
[3:39:58.800 --> 3:40:02.160]  uh... i'm from toronto can as you can tell uh... pat hello to you
[3:40:02.160 --> 3:40:05.360]  uh... what i'm concerned about my question concerns uh... in canada right
[3:40:05.360 --> 3:40:08.480]  now it's like the chickens are really coming home to roost what happened in
[3:40:08.480 --> 3:40:10.840]  america happened like over the last few years or so
[3:40:10.840 --> 3:40:12.200]  uh... from your knowledge
[3:40:12.200 --> 3:40:16.080]  how is that an impact differently or is it going to be somewhat uh...
[3:40:16.080 --> 3:40:19.740]  somewhat comparative to the u.s. what's happening u.s. right now in terms of
[3:40:19.740 --> 3:40:22.320]  the stock market going down inflation
[3:40:22.320 --> 3:40:25.520]  i mean canada has uh... has a lot of resource in terms of
[3:40:25.520 --> 3:40:27.600]  oil water timber and
[3:40:27.600 --> 3:40:32.240]  we're more like you have the same controllers are in the same thing to you
[3:40:32.240 --> 3:40:33.720]  management system pat
[3:40:33.720 --> 3:40:38.160]  yeah that's exactly right your systems uh... only trivially different
[3:40:38.160 --> 3:40:41.560]  uh... you know one of the funny things by canada lately is the uh... bankers
[3:40:41.560 --> 3:40:45.280]  are so weak but we bought a fractional reserve banking
[3:40:45.280 --> 3:40:48.160]  and i looked at a lot how can i say that because they still have fractional
[3:40:48.160 --> 3:40:48.840]  reserve
[3:40:48.840 --> 3:40:51.960]  well because they reduce the reserve requirement is zero
[3:40:51.960 --> 3:40:55.840]  uh... it's actually a worse
[3:40:55.840 --> 3:40:59.440]  of a banking because they don't require the banks to retain any reserve
[3:40:59.440 --> 3:41:00.600]  whatsoever they just
[3:41:00.600 --> 3:41:04.680]  created by the way the former head of the uh... treasury policy
[3:41:04.680 --> 3:41:07.640]  uh... analyze the uh... but the banker takeover bill
[3:41:07.640 --> 3:41:09.040]  not notice the bailout
[3:41:09.040 --> 3:41:13.480]  and that he said it's clearly in there for no reserves now here too so
[3:41:13.480 --> 3:41:17.200]  yeah well we they already have there's a number of categories of loans like your
[3:41:17.200 --> 3:41:19.000]  currency loans
[3:41:19.000 --> 3:41:21.920]  the first time it's ninety three million dollars in loans and so forth with
[3:41:21.920 --> 3:41:24.400]  no reserves required that's why
[3:41:24.400 --> 3:41:28.080]  about ninety eight percent of our money supplies created by the banks not ninety
[3:41:28.080 --> 3:41:29.960]  percent
[3:41:29.960 --> 3:41:32.440]  absolutely i got anything else uh... color
[3:41:32.440 --> 3:41:35.400]  no i just want to i want to thank you personally understand just from listen
[3:41:35.400 --> 3:41:38.960]  to your radio show i became you to the truth movement going back to february
[3:41:38.960 --> 3:41:42.440]  and you know i hear you spilling your guts out in the year almost every single
[3:41:42.440 --> 3:41:43.160]  day
[3:41:43.160 --> 3:41:45.840]  and i just want to let you know it's not it's not without cause you're
[3:41:45.840 --> 3:41:47.040]  waking people up
[3:41:47.040 --> 3:41:50.360]  you mean you have people in in other nations that understand that
[3:41:50.360 --> 3:41:54.280]  america needs to be america it cannot fall the second america falls i mean
[3:41:54.280 --> 3:41:55.880]  everything else goes with it
[3:41:55.880 --> 3:41:56.440]  you know
[3:41:56.440 --> 3:42:00.640]  so i want to give you the news we have fallen and until we realize that we've
[3:42:00.640 --> 3:42:02.480]  we've got to get it back
[3:42:02.480 --> 3:42:05.480]  fair enough fair enough but i'm an optimist no no i hear you i hear you and
[3:42:05.480 --> 3:42:08.960]  god bless you god bless you i appreciate your call uh...
[3:42:08.960 --> 3:42:12.040]  let me explain something let's say in canada somebody on their own go their
[3:42:12.040 --> 3:42:15.760]  own goldmine or land that gold was found on or their own timber
[3:42:15.760 --> 3:42:19.040]  that's what the environmental socialist movements about control of the banks
[3:42:19.040 --> 3:42:20.160]  and they state this
[3:42:20.160 --> 3:42:24.120]  richard and haas had the cfr states and cfr and club of rome documents
[3:42:24.120 --> 3:42:26.200]  tickle the nineteen ninety one documents
[3:42:26.200 --> 3:42:31.160]  uh... they selectively come and then to sick the regulators on you don't let you
[3:42:31.160 --> 3:42:33.400]  goldmine only cut timber don't let you
[3:42:33.400 --> 3:42:34.520]  use your property
[3:42:34.520 --> 3:42:37.800]  but then the big corporations i mean here's an example you pull up the
[3:42:37.800 --> 3:42:39.960]  numbers from more than a decade ago
[3:42:39.960 --> 3:42:41.400]  tyson chicken
[3:42:41.400 --> 3:42:45.440]  in arkansas alone could have thousands the number was thirteen hundred and i
[3:42:45.440 --> 3:42:47.480]  remember from memory and in the a p
[3:42:47.480 --> 3:42:50.200]  thirteen hundred violations at one point
[3:42:50.200 --> 3:42:52.240]  and they weren't shut down were hardly fine
[3:42:52.240 --> 3:42:55.720]  but then another independent separate chicken plant had something like six in
[3:42:55.720 --> 3:42:56.400]  a year
[3:42:56.400 --> 3:42:58.080]  and they were shut down
[3:42:58.080 --> 3:43:01.520]  uh... it's the same thing with beef packing all of it that uh... people
[3:43:01.520 --> 3:43:05.360]  think big corporations don't regulations the big boys do pat in
[3:43:05.360 --> 3:43:07.800]  closing can you explain that to them
[3:43:07.800 --> 3:43:09.240]  well it's the power money
[3:43:09.240 --> 3:43:13.680]  uh... again we've been talking most of it most of the uh... last hour about
[3:43:13.680 --> 3:43:17.200]  that that's the concentration of wealth and obviously
[3:43:17.200 --> 3:43:20.920]  princess you know these four major banks about eight trillion and assets
[3:43:20.920 --> 3:43:23.840]  well they have four presidents four men
[3:43:23.840 --> 3:43:26.160]  four thousand or four hundred thousand
[3:43:26.160 --> 3:43:29.880]  make the ultimate decisions in those banks that affect
[3:43:29.880 --> 3:43:31.560]  hundreds of thousands
[3:43:31.560 --> 3:43:34.640]  of loans i mean that's incredible power
[3:43:34.640 --> 3:43:38.400]  and so they and obviously they're tempted to increase it you know these
[3:43:38.400 --> 3:43:41.740]  are materialistic these are people highly motivated
[3:43:41.740 --> 3:43:44.640]  there may be exceptions but for the most part they're certainly not highly
[3:43:44.640 --> 3:43:46.680]  motivated by religion
[3:43:46.680 --> 3:43:50.880]  or ethical values uh... they're so they simply want to increase their power
[3:43:50.880 --> 3:43:54.680]  and uh... that's a reliable viewing what's happening right now
[3:43:54.680 --> 3:43:58.200]  and so uh... they use it to corrupt the political system
[3:43:58.200 --> 3:43:59.920]  you know they corrupt the media
[3:43:59.920 --> 3:44:01.520]  and by buying it
[3:44:01.520 --> 3:44:05.600]  and uh... that's what you're up against so if it's no wonder that creeps down
[3:44:05.600 --> 3:44:06.960]  to the level of
[3:44:06.960 --> 3:44:10.160]  a small businessmen being treated mistreated by the government and a
[3:44:10.160 --> 3:44:13.000]  large one getting away with all kinds of violation

[3:53:56.560 --> 3:54:00.160]  take it and now they have the points program or even if you're not convicted
[3:54:00.160 --> 3:54:04.320]  of it people are getting thousand dollar fines and things in the mail I mean the
[3:54:04.320 --> 3:54:06.960]  system is just completely corrupt they're raising the money to put it in the
[3:54:06.960 --> 3:54:10.320]  private banks in the brokerage firms the cities and counties take the vast
[3:54:10.320 --> 3:54:14.320]  majority of their money over sixty percent on national average with the cfr's
[3:54:14.320 --> 3:54:17.560]  count count of the uh... conference panel financial reports of trying to hurry
[3:54:17.560 --> 3:54:23.160]  here and they they invest in a it's just it's all gone they're taking it all
[3:54:23.160 --> 3:54:26.600]  and then you can it's a criminal business now
[3:54:26.600 --> 3:54:28.920]  now as if that isn't bad enough
[3:54:28.920 --> 3:54:34.120]  uh... in uh... dc it's a little private district of criminals and in new jersey
[3:54:34.120 --> 3:54:36.960]  that they are claiming that it's a law
[3:54:36.960 --> 3:54:38.520]  that you've got to take
[3:54:38.520 --> 3:54:44.080]  anoculations
[3:54:44.080 --> 3:54:46.360]  they're claiming that you have to do it
[3:54:46.360 --> 3:54:49.080]  and then even the vaccine groups are getting roped into the singling with
[3:54:49.080 --> 3:54:52.920]  there are no we have a right to say no to mandatory shots
[3:54:52.920 --> 3:54:54.960]  there is a waiver but up
[3:54:54.960 --> 3:54:58.080]  a waiver for a law that doesn't exist even that is a fraud
[3:54:58.080 --> 3:55:01.080]  the way they get you is the truancy clause
[3:55:01.080 --> 3:55:04.200]  they say under policy you're kicked out of school
[3:55:04.200 --> 3:55:07.880]  they don't tell you about law they've got to give you the waiver
[3:55:07.880 --> 3:55:10.960]  but but the whole issue is now they've listed in the advertising news it's the
[3:55:10.960 --> 3:55:16.520]  law everybody's got to take the flu shot
[3:55:16.520 --> 3:55:18.480]  which for those that don't know
[3:55:18.480 --> 3:55:21.800]  the last six years they haven't gotten the flu right you know that they're
[3:55:21.800 --> 3:55:24.040]  always guessing the year before how it's going to mutate
[3:55:24.040 --> 3:55:27.560]  that's filled with mercury still in there very dangerous
[3:55:27.560 --> 3:55:31.720]  uh... the flu shots admittedly have killed a lot of people
[3:55:31.720 --> 3:55:35.680]  a flu season approaches many new jersey parents are furious over a first in
[3:55:35.680 --> 3:55:36.440]  the nation
[3:55:36.440 --> 3:55:38.280]  requirement the children get a flu shot
[3:55:38.280 --> 3:55:41.400]  just like texas was first the nation girls have to take
[3:55:41.400 --> 3:55:43.480]  the hpv but there was no law
[3:55:43.480 --> 3:55:46.040]  they just listed it in the state health department is recommended in the
[3:55:46.040 --> 3:55:48.840]  schools and say it's mandatory no law
[3:55:48.840 --> 3:55:51.160]  but people don't know that
[3:55:51.160 --> 3:55:53.600]  requirement the children get a flu shot in order to attend preschools and day
[3:55:53.600 --> 3:55:54.520]  care centers
[3:55:54.520 --> 3:55:57.280]  the decision should be the parents of the states they
[3:55:57.280 --> 3:55:58.440]  continued
[3:55:58.440 --> 3:56:01.320]  so see it's it's just like they could never pass the animal i'd be in premise
[3:56:01.320 --> 3:56:04.600]  society to take over farms and ranches but they ordered the full the four h
[3:56:04.600 --> 3:56:06.360]  club and all the other clubs
[3:56:06.360 --> 3:56:09.600]  to just not tell people and then kick them out of
[3:56:09.600 --> 3:56:11.640]  farm shows livestock shows
[3:56:11.640 --> 3:56:14.080]  that police escort them off like their criminals
[3:56:14.080 --> 3:56:17.760]  again they know the public's ignorant and so they engage in this racketeering
[3:56:17.760 --> 3:56:20.400]  it's racketeering
[3:56:20.400 --> 3:56:24.680]  now that isn't bad enough and i'm gonna get some guest on about this uh... next
[3:56:24.680 --> 3:56:27.320]  week of course i'll be live this sunday four to six p.m.
[3:56:27.320 --> 3:56:30.160]  central with the abbreviated sunday two-hour show
[3:56:30.160 --> 3:56:34.360]  but uh... u s a today most health workers skip flu shot
[3:56:34.360 --> 3:56:37.040]  and here is the article
[3:56:37.040 --> 3:56:39.780]  remember when they claim it was mandatory that all the health workers at the
[3:56:39.780 --> 3:56:41.000]  take the
[3:56:41.000 --> 3:56:42.920]  smallpox shot and ninety
[3:56:42.920 --> 3:56:45.680]  plus percent refused
[3:56:45.680 --> 3:56:49.760]  according to uh... u s a day was the same publication the l a times back then
[3:56:49.760 --> 3:56:56.280]  it was four thousand out of fourteen million first responders
[3:56:56.280 --> 3:56:59.680]  most health workers skip flu shot operating room nurses
[3:56:59.680 --> 3:57:04.600]  paula taylor knows her refusal to get a flu shot is based on faulty logic
[3:57:04.600 --> 3:57:05.680]  so it goes on to say
[3:57:05.680 --> 3:57:09.720]  oh she admits she's an idiot no no she doesn't
[3:57:09.720 --> 3:57:12.600]  but ever since she got sick after getting a shot a few years ago she's
[3:57:12.600 --> 3:57:14.120]  sworn off the vaccine
[3:57:14.120 --> 3:57:17.080]  i really get sick the only thing i could narrow it down to was i've gotten the
[3:57:17.080 --> 3:57:17.760]  shot
[3:57:17.760 --> 3:57:19.680]  well of course it kills a lot of people
[3:57:19.680 --> 3:57:22.680]  said taylor works for university hospital at clinics in iowa city
[3:57:22.680 --> 3:57:26.760]  i know that's not a live virus it just seemed pretty coincidental
[3:57:26.760 --> 3:57:29.120]  such stories frustrate doctor william
[3:57:29.120 --> 3:57:33.440]  shafer so they treat us like we're a bunch of idiots we won't take it
[3:57:33.440 --> 3:57:35.800]  you know you're dumb
[3:57:35.800 --> 3:57:37.320]  i mean the swine flu
[3:57:37.320 --> 3:57:41.080]  uh... shots killed tens of thousands i mean i mean that kills people h pv's
[3:57:41.080 --> 3:57:42.720]  killing people
[3:57:42.720 --> 3:57:46.200]  that's in the cdc but they have articles about crazy people think it might be bad
[3:57:46.200 --> 3:57:50.640]  for them they're just backwoods knuckle drager idiots
[3:57:50.640 --> 3:57:53.760]  so it goes on to say the majority of them in here
[3:57:53.760 --> 3:57:56.160]  won't take it
[3:57:56.160 --> 3:57:58.520]  they try to threaten parents would take on their children and they don't when
[3:57:58.520 --> 3:57:59.760]  there's no law

[3:58:18.880 --> 3:58:22.760]  they're just backwoods knuckle drager idiots
[3:58:22.760 --> 3:58:25.880]  so it goes on to say the majority of them in here
