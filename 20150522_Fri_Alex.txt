[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government coverups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:31.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:31.000 --> 00:55.000]  bad news the globalist Trans Pacific partnership that transfers pretty much whatever sovereignty was left of this country to private corporate global bodies has been ran through by the Democrats and Republicans Obama's trade bill narrowly clears key Senate hurdle that it had failed to clear last week deals details not released to the public
[00:55.000 --> 01:20.000]  conservatives could push over the finish line Mexico ways US meat products sanctions congressional approval ratings collapse yeah polls are out on this over 85% of Americans in a Gallup poll last week are against the TPP hard to believe there's 15% that
[01:20.000 --> 01:41.000]  want a secret global treaty to be passed that no one's allowed to see and wiki leaks is released only part of it and that's where the internet is turned over to select corporations and there's no free speech you just can't make this stuff up
[01:41.000 --> 01:55.000]  the world is plunging into tyranny and I'll be quite frank with you this is a very stressful job to be aware of all the things that are happening I mean I'm not complaining I'm just saying sometimes I've seen angry or upset
[01:55.000 --> 02:11.000]  on TV or radio it's it's not fake I blew up 10 minutes ago before everyone on air because it just it is overwhelming how over the top all of this is and that's the globalist plan
[02:11.000 --> 02:30.000]  ram the whole stinking thing through throw it in everybody's face be over the top invert reality and then declare those of us that want basic sanity and basic freedom to be tyrants or those of us who aren't racist say that we're the racist
[02:30.000 --> 02:48.000]  dumb the political debate down for the most mindless level ever imaginable last night this morning reading the news and coming in today look at the stacks just all of these stories are totally insane
[02:48.000 --> 03:05.000]  there's one out of Associated Press there's another one out of Reuters police want bikers off streets after deadly Texas shooting and all these days later five six days later
[03:05.000 --> 03:20.000]  they're still saying Harley Davidson is closed across the state and they're asking bikers not to drive down highways because the snipers may come after you because we're expecting retaliation from the bandidos and the bandidos are on TV going
[03:20.000 --> 03:35.000]  to start a war with the police I guess only George Soros does that and gets away with it you know not the collaborator and I'm not defending the bandidos the point is this is a major power grab so Joe Biggs if it quits reigning is going to ride around his Harley today
[03:35.000 --> 03:50.000]  and will ride up the cops and say you know do you think I'm a terrorist because I'm riding around on my motorcycle it's just everything is a power grab nowadays and that's just one of the cuckoo stories I've got there's there's hundreds of them
[03:50.000 --> 04:15.000]  yesterday I ran into the cream of the scum I mean I ran into what this artificial decadence society has produced on every front it was the most bizarre confluence of hypocrisy and bizarre
[04:15.000 --> 04:33.000]  pro-landness the videos up on info wars dot com we're spending a lot of time on this today shock video militant communists attack pro-life protest and they were pulling up in like $80,000 brand new Jaguars I went and looked it up
[04:33.000 --> 04:58.000]  and then then I got in my Dodge Challenger they were screaming one percenter I mean it is just crazy town and the women saying how dare whites try to adopt black babies abort them abort them I killed my babies I kill them I mean just I love Satan hell Satan I mean just and then they're so weak on top of it I mean it is unbelievable
[04:58.000 --> 05:08.000]  The latest example of liberal free speech oppression is brought to you by Kit Daniels in the article campus police intimidate student over her anti-Obama and pro-gun signs
[05:08.000 --> 05:17.000]  a college student is suing her school after three campus cops and an administrator ordered her not to carry an anti-Obama sign and a pro-gun sign on campus without special permission
[05:17.000 --> 05:33.000]  Nicole Sanders a student at blend college in Brenham Texas was recently demonstrating with the signs when she was told she needed special permission for them and had to stay in the colleges free speech zone I needed to fill out a form stating what I'm doing where I'm doing it who's involved and what outcome we're expecting she said
[05:33.000 --> 05:48.000]  She didn't wait until four administrators sign it in response Sanders has filed a lawsuit against blend college stating its policies and their enforcement are unconstitutional this story is eerily similar to an incident at California Polytech earlier this year in which school officials were also requiring
[05:48.000 --> 05:59.000]  students who engage in First Amendment activities on campus to apply for a free speech permit you can find more stories like these at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com Rob do reporting for info wars nightly news

[09:35.000 --> 09:50.000]  and then we're going to have leon macadoo in along with paul watson via skype and then rob do in the last 20 minutes of the show or so to give his breakdown on the situation
[09:50.000 --> 10:13.000]  i talk about stories that are rosetta stones decoders if you have this decoder if you have this this this this block that has the different alphabet codes spelled out you can then read the tea leaves and there are a lot of these stories every day that connect the dots together basically
[10:13.000 --> 10:26.000]  but i'll be honest with you i did not intend i mean i wanted it to be but i didn't think sending out the reporters to demonstrate and point out that
[10:26.000 --> 10:43.000]  it was founded by margaret sanger and she helped set up the keiser velhom institute that bank rolled hitler and that she was one of his top advisors and hitler wrote that one of her books was his quote bible and i cover all this in the film in game i show her
[10:43.000 --> 10:56.000]  i show it from the university archives i show her book i show hitler transcripts of radio addresses thanking margaret sanger i mean she went to germany and met repeatedly with hitler so did thomas watson the founder of ibm
[10:56.000 --> 11:13.000]  who did have like a hundred eighty iq but was a flaming racist and wanted to exterminate every black person on earth and then you notice ibm funds all the multicultural push and all this stuff because they want to get blacks on the
[11:13.000 --> 11:30.000]  plantation in the inner city control grid on welfare socialized so they can be destroyed and boy have they destroyed them i mean they they have wrecked the black community they have devastated it every metric shows that so regardless of where you stand on abortion
[11:30.000 --> 11:45.000]  i'm not judging you if you've had an abortion i'm not on some high horse i'm not saying you're a devil okay i'm pointing out where it came from and why they're pushing it and what the agenda is
[11:45.000 --> 11:55.000]  and then once they collectivize things they say see we don't want to pay for all these poor people kill them we don't pay for these old people kill them we don't pay for these veterans put them on no treat list
[11:55.000 --> 12:02.000]  and this is what they say to me how dare you not want to abort the black babies nobody wants them i've had whites blacks all of them tell me that
[12:02.000 --> 12:12.000]  and i finally caught it on video i've told you about being in a pro-life demonstrations back when i still did stuff like that fifteen sixteen years ago
[12:12.000 --> 12:19.000]  and it all started from guilt from abortions that i was involved in i've never hidden that i'm ashamed of that
[12:19.000 --> 12:30.000]  but i'm honest about it and i'll admit my serious failings and i wasn't driving under pushing women to do it but i could have pressured them could have said i'm going to marry you
[12:30.000 --> 12:38.000]  could have changed the whole course of my life but i wish when i was sixteen i'd have got married i wish i wouldn't have been passively involved
[12:38.000 --> 12:43.000]  or then when i was twenty again i repent for that every day well frankly it's why i'm not afraid to die
[12:43.000 --> 12:50.000]  subconsciously sometimes i just hope somebody walks up and i'm in public and shoots me right in the head because i'm a sinner damn it
[12:50.000 --> 12:57.000]  and that's what it comes down to so i'm willing to do whatever it takes to stand up for the unborn
[12:57.000 --> 13:04.000]  i don't want to die i want to be here for my children i want to fight the globalist but i'm saying at the end of the day i am fearless
[13:04.000 --> 13:11.000]  because i know that's what i've got to do it's something i can't even describe i've got to be fearless i've got to have the will to do whatever it takes
[13:11.000 --> 13:20.000]  or i'm not going to be redeemed and that's not out of some fear either my soul knows it and wants to be good
[13:20.000 --> 13:26.000]  and lord knows i'm bad lord knows i'm bad these little wannabes want to be wicked
[13:26.000 --> 13:33.000]  what they don't know about the hearts of good men and women is that we our goodness is huge and large and strong and beautiful
[13:33.000 --> 13:42.000]  just like our whole soul is big but our bad size bigger deeper meaner sicker than these felt could ever imagine
[13:42.000 --> 13:53.000]  i cannot believe how weak servants of evil are it's all i can do to not want to just smash them
[13:53.000 --> 14:05.000]  they love death so much why do they want to visit on others i don't think visit on themselves
[14:05.000 --> 14:11.000]  so we have events we see things that happen points rubicons that are crossed
[14:11.000 --> 14:19.000]  and so it all started three weeks ago when mckels failing one of our great writers that's kind of reporters
[14:19.000 --> 14:27.000]  said you know they're talking about black lives matter all day it's a few hundred blacks a year that get shot in questionable situations by the police
[14:27.000 --> 14:36.000]  lord knows the police in some areas are out of control being federalized but we ought to do a story about and put out a meme on facebook about black lives matter
[14:36.000 --> 14:43.000]  and show the abortion numbers seventeen million sixteen and a half seventeen million the numbers vary of the fifty six million people
[14:43.000 --> 14:52.000]  in a very heavy way and i said even better let me talk to jacari and i know he's pro-life and a christian we ought to see if he wants to lead a demonstration
[14:52.000 --> 14:58.000]  just to point this out and we're sure the media will attack it and demonizes and then we can probably get these going around the country
[14:58.000 --> 15:06.000]  and try to hijack this soros you know war with the police movement and then i have reverend childrens on to promote this event
[15:06.000 --> 15:14.000]  in february he's been doing it at black genocide dot org separately in uh... in south carolina and other areas having a big effect
[15:14.000 --> 15:21.000]  so see our minds think alike as we're directed by the same energy we're on the same page we're brothers at a spiritual level
[15:21.000 --> 15:28.000]  and that's when you really start getting into this start warring against the globalist you become more spiritual and you get closer to god folks
[15:28.000 --> 15:38.000]  you will face devil worshipers at the bottom of the rat hole is always a evil satanist and i've told you so many times that the anarchists
[15:38.000 --> 15:45.000]  they're never anarchists they call themselves anarchists they're all about deception and i told them as soon as i saw them ten seconds in we went to break
[15:45.000 --> 15:50.000]  i said you see those folks in black i can tell by their demeanor their look they're gonna start blocking attacking people
[15:50.000 --> 15:55.000]  try to tear down signs they're gonna say they're anarchists they're gonna be communists and then they're gonna be satanist
[15:55.000 --> 15:59.000]  boom it starts getting announced instantly and i've seen them from england
[15:59.000 --> 16:05.000]  uh... to denver colorado from new york city to to l.a. they could be black they could be white
[16:05.000 --> 16:12.000]  they could be hispanic they all act and look the same and and they they radiate weakness
[16:12.000 --> 16:20.000]  they they radiate fallenness they radiate just a death wish for innocence they radiate hell
[16:20.000 --> 16:26.000]  and i don't like being in their presence because i'm gonna be honest
[16:26.000 --> 16:35.000]  i just i mean they are they are an abomination that they are they are what comes after the innocence they are the enemy
[16:35.000 --> 16:45.000]  they are the enemy manifest and if you don't want to throw yourself against that god spirits not in you
[16:45.000 --> 16:51.000]  i'm not up on some high horse folks i'm here to tell you right now if you aren't repulsed by these people
[16:51.000 --> 16:54.000]  something's wrong
[16:54.000 --> 16:57.000]  now we go out to this demonstration
[16:57.000 --> 17:00.000]  the videos are on info wars dot com and principle dot com
[17:00.000 --> 17:03.000]  and i see them being mean to david night's wife getting her face shoving on her
[17:03.000 --> 17:10.000]  i said that's it i'm going down there i get there a bunch of them run and leave when they see me arrive
[17:10.000 --> 17:14.000]  i get out i go over i'm just doing interviews i'm being nice
[17:14.000 --> 17:17.000]  they come over and cuss on the microphone
[17:17.000 --> 17:22.000]  then they all link arms how to run over it's knocking people over
[17:22.000 --> 17:27.000]  one of them punches me grabs at me grabs the mic i get it back grabs it again everybody's seen the video
[17:27.000 --> 17:31.000]  or heard it happen live on the radio here
[17:31.000 --> 17:36.000]  the videos on info wars dot com but we didn't know who we were dealing with i just said they're gonna
[17:36.000 --> 17:41.000]  i can just look at them on skype for five seconds go to break i told the whole crew
[17:41.000 --> 17:45.000]  i said well i said on air too i said those are going to be
[17:45.000 --> 17:51.000]  they're gonna say they're anarchist then they're gonna be communists but that's only gonna be a front for a bloodlust
[17:51.000 --> 17:55.000]  and i've been around communists more than a hundred times
[17:55.000 --> 17:59.000]  we have footage actually we have a footage a few times in new york
[17:59.000 --> 18:05.000]  it's the same growth a Maoist red guard it's a real national group
[18:05.000 --> 18:09.000]  and there were these older folks there and they come over and i go well Stalin killed
[18:09.000 --> 18:13.000]  millions and Mao killed millions they go too bad they didn't kill you
[18:13.000 --> 18:18.000]  and as soon as we turned away and walked off they walk over and we go they said we take over you're dead
[18:18.000 --> 18:22.000]  and i had a major well-known socialist here a few years ago to be in a film
[18:22.000 --> 18:26.000]  and i couldn't morally even put them in the film because i went to dinner with them and robbie was there
[18:26.000 --> 18:31.000]  and he said listen we take over we're gonna kill millions they're gonna be blood
[18:31.000 --> 18:35.000]  you better join us we're gonna kill we want blood we want death
[18:35.000 --> 18:40.000]  and see when you learn that Lenin was really a satanist all of it clicks
[18:40.000 --> 18:45.000]  that's even in mainline history books you can dig in he was a devil worshipper
[18:45.000 --> 18:50.000]  and this group's on their site saying they want red terror against me and all the rest of this
[18:50.000 --> 18:55.000]  as if i'm i go up against the globalist the heart their masters george soros
[18:55.000 --> 19:00.000]  the nazi collaborator that funds these anti-police groups do you think i fear you
[19:00.000 --> 19:10.000]  i mean what a joke you are only one tiny little magnifying glass of the rot for us to examine
[19:10.000 --> 19:28.000]  as a study piece as an educational prop as a textbook example of of what serving wickedness
[19:28.000 --> 19:35.000]  will turn you into when we come back i'm gonna get into all of it but then we go to their
[19:35.000 --> 19:39.000]  facebook and it's all them we ask them you know are you these communists are you doing
[19:39.000 --> 19:42.000]  they say no that's not us when it's all them we have their names everything it's on their
[19:42.000 --> 19:49.000]  facebook they didn't shield their private group settings and it's all how we're gonna

[33:21.000 --> 33:26.000]  UK they're being sacrificed on the altar of efficiency and prosperity
[33:26.000 --> 33:36.000]  the powder flesh from dead babies some people believe they can cure disease

[33:46.000 --> 33:52.000]  exhausted you must evacuate the area
[33:52.000 --> 33:58.000]  that the shareholders of Pepsi co big builder bird group company are not

[34:03.000 --> 34:08.000]  but we already know so enjoy the flavor we're going to get the real solution
[34:08.000 --> 34:11.000]  which is going to be a combination of death panels and and sales taxes
[34:11.000 --> 34:16.000]  I'm consistently pro-death I'm for assisted suicide I'm for regular
[34:16.000 --> 34:20.000]  I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving is spending a million dollars on that
[34:20.000 --> 34:25.000]  last three months of life for that patient would it be better not to lay off
[34:25.000 --> 34:30.000]  the those 10 teachers and to make that trade up in medical costs but that's
[34:30.000 --> 34:34.000]  called the death panel and you're not supposed to have that discussion
[34:34.000 --> 34:41.000]  they told me to say that they were sorry but you had become unreliable
[34:48.000 --> 34:52.000]  is this the kind of society that you want to live in any kind of society
[34:52.000 --> 34:56.000]  that would do this to its children will do it to its senior citizens
[34:56.000 --> 35:00.000]  it will do it to its descendants that kind of society will also eventually
[35:00.000 --> 35:05.000]  turn on its police on its army on its prison guards on the quiz lings and
[35:05.000 --> 35:10.000]  the collaborators who make that possible this is nothing but a suicide cult
[35:10.000 --> 35:15.000]  the scoops are on their way the scoops are on their way
[35:15.000 --> 35:19.000]  I repeat the scoops are on their way
[35:19.000 --> 35:24.000]  you will find out why soylent green means life you will find out why soylent

[35:36.000 --> 35:42.000]  they gotta stop them next thing they'll be breeding is like cattle for food
[35:42.000 --> 35:46.000]  you gotta tell them
[35:46.000 --> 35:50.000]  and that piece was made two years ago
[35:50.000 --> 35:54.000]  which one of our great info warriors put that piece together I forget
[35:54.000 --> 35:58.000]  is it Jacari Jackson was it Darren McBreen I think it was Darren
[35:58.000 --> 36:02.000]  Darren McBreen yeah amazing work amazing broadcaster
[36:02.000 --> 36:06.000]  that was made two years ago
[36:06.000 --> 36:10.000]  almost two years ago and you notice David Knight was talking about
[36:10.000 --> 36:14.000]  they'll turn on their police they'll turn on their military
[36:14.000 --> 36:18.000]  they'll turn on the quiz links that help the system do this
[36:18.000 --> 36:22.000]  that's what always happens and notice now George Soros is funding that
[36:22.000 --> 36:26.000]  we're not endorsing the excesses of the police and how they've been mutated in many
[36:26.000 --> 36:30.000]  areas and how they're being federalized we told you the plan was attack the police
[36:30.000 --> 36:34.000]  blame them for the imploding economy blame them for the globalism
[36:34.000 --> 36:38.000]  blame them for every problem and not the globalist who
[36:38.000 --> 36:42.000]  are training them and executing this takeover and who are sucking
[36:42.000 --> 36:46.000]  the country and the planet dry of resources and
[36:46.000 --> 36:50.000]  money and freedom
[36:50.000 --> 36:54.000]  who are dominating the globe and when they start going into that phase of revolution
[36:54.000 --> 36:58.000]  like they did in Ukraine to overthrow Ukraine
[36:58.000 --> 37:02.000]  a year and a half ago now when they start funding an Arab Spring not to bring
[37:02.000 --> 37:06.000]  freedom to the Middle East but to enslave
[37:06.000 --> 37:10.000]  you know
[37:10.000 --> 37:14.000]  you know that you're in trouble
[37:14.000 --> 37:18.000]  and now there are major moves
[37:18.000 --> 37:22.000]  to basically start World War 3 in Ukraine
[37:22.000 --> 37:26.000]  and George Soros has come out and said he's worried about World War 3
[37:26.000 --> 37:30.000]  that's like an arsonist calling the fire department after he sets fire to a building
[37:30.000 --> 37:34.000]  headline conspiracy theorist are causing
[37:34.000 --> 37:38.000]  militants to abandon ISIS Steve Watson
[37:38.000 --> 37:42.000]  writes about the announcements made by NATO and others
[37:42.000 --> 37:46.000]  the ISIS Ramadi victory and the
[37:46.000 --> 37:50.000]  breakup of Iraq we're going to break that down shock video militant communist
[37:50.000 --> 37:54.000]  attack pro-life protesters we're going to hit that in a moment
[37:54.000 --> 37:58.000]  but do you know that it came out the London Independent
[37:58.000 --> 38:02.000]  that Assad the leader of Syria
[38:02.000 --> 38:06.000]  directed his ministry to
[38:06.000 --> 38:10.000]  republish info wars dot com articles and you know why because they're true
[38:10.000 --> 38:14.000]  we expose the nerve gas was launched by Saudi Arabian operatives
[38:14.000 --> 38:18.000]  that came out of here later at the UN we expose the fact that it was
[38:18.000 --> 38:22.000]  a proxy war against Russia with our guests like Colonel Shaffer and others
[38:22.000 --> 38:26.000]  the day it all started five years ago we predicted
[38:26.000 --> 38:30.000]  they would then break up the country and create a new Islamic state
[38:30.000 --> 38:34.000]  connected to Saudi Arabia and a caliphate because that's their stated
[38:34.000 --> 38:38.000]  plan and the West is directing it and we said that they're
[38:38.000 --> 38:42.000]  recruiting useful idiots out of the radicalized Muslim
[38:42.000 --> 38:46.000]  communities that are being allowed to operate and recruit
[38:46.000 --> 38:50.000]  and that most of their ground fighters are useful idiot morons
[38:50.000 --> 38:54.000]  to their controllers who were commanded by
[38:54.000 --> 38:58.000]  my six by CIA by Turkish intelligence
[38:58.000 --> 39:02.000]  by some units of Israeli intelligence and some factions of Pakistani intelligence
[39:02.000 --> 39:06.000]  to destabilize the region and quarterbacked
[39:06.000 --> 39:10.000]  Saudi Arabia Qatar and others and it's that decompartmentalization
[39:10.000 --> 39:14.000]  is the real power of this broadcast because you read the article they're now
[39:14.000 --> 39:18.000]  admitting that the conspiracy theorists
[39:18.000 --> 39:22.000]  out there saying that ISIS is globalist run to break up the Middle East
[39:22.000 --> 39:26.000]  and cause a Muslim civil war to destabilize the area and bring it
[39:26.000 --> 39:30.000]  back to the stone age and that it's anti-Muslim to do that
[39:30.000 --> 39:34.000]  it's anti the people that live in that area and that it's a
[39:34.000 --> 39:38.000]  culture war bomb and now ISIS's biggest problem
[39:38.000 --> 39:42.000]  is getting their funding cut off because we're trying to keep
[39:42.000 --> 39:46.000]  Congress from funding this free Syrian army that is ISIS in Al Qaeda
[39:46.000 --> 39:50.000]  and we are exposing to
[39:50.000 --> 39:54.000]  their grunts that they're really working for the New World Order
[39:54.000 --> 39:58.000]  that's why ISIS for two years back when they even called Al Qaeda were threatening
[39:58.000 --> 40:02.000]  us and saying they were going to attack us now the official ISIS puts us in their
[40:02.000 --> 40:06.000]  videos and says we're coming for you and all the rest of it because they're angry
[40:06.000 --> 40:10.000]  I'm here to take on the communist
[40:10.000 --> 40:14.000]  to take on ISIS to take on the New World Order I'm here
[40:14.000 --> 40:18.000]  and listen I'm here to show you what the people can do
[40:18.000 --> 40:22.000]  we're fighting a bunch of vipers and trash and they can't trump the
[40:22.000 --> 40:26.000]  ISIS page and that's the truth we've got the truth
[40:26.000 --> 40:30.000]  that's why at the highest levels of NATO
[40:30.000 --> 40:34.000]  the highest levels of the Japanese government the highest level of major governments
[40:34.000 --> 40:38.000]  around the world the Russian government you name it
[40:38.000 --> 40:42.000]  you know what they listen to they listen to this radio show
[40:42.000 --> 40:46.000]  because other people don't have the will to just tell it like it is
[40:46.000 --> 40:50.000]  folks in government listen to this show because they're somewhat
[40:50.000 --> 40:54.000]  decompartmentalized and they go yeah this guy knows what he's talking about his guests
[40:54.000 --> 40:58.000]  know what they talk about no one else will talk about the real paradigm but more and
[40:58.000 --> 41:02.000]  more people are and once the new paradigm of reality is there
[41:02.000 --> 41:06.000]  and people see from a globalist perspective how they're manipulating things
[41:06.000 --> 41:10.000]  see we're in the seat of the globalist but we don't want to carry out
[41:10.000 --> 41:14.000]  their operations we've gotten in their position from their point of view
[41:14.000 --> 41:18.000]  to understand their operations we get other people to get in the enemy's position
[41:18.000 --> 41:22.000]  that's how a good general wins a war he gets in the mind of
[41:22.000 --> 41:26.000]  the other generals he's fighting he learns everything he can about
[41:26.000 --> 41:30.000]  how they operate how do you catch a serial killer if you're a good detective
[41:30.000 --> 41:34.000]  you get in their mind you study them you
[41:34.000 --> 41:38.000]  immerse yourself in the clues and what that's connected to
[41:38.000 --> 41:42.000]  and that's what we've done with the globalist
[41:42.000 --> 41:46.000]  and thank god we've now escaped gravity
[41:46.000 --> 41:50.000]  and by that they could kill me shut me down now
[41:50.000 --> 41:54.000]  we've gotten out of gravity the rocket was successful we
[41:54.000 --> 41:58.000]  can now declare real success I've known this for about a year but now I can
[41:58.000 --> 42:02.000]  really say it and the enemy now recognizes this so when foreign media
[42:02.000 --> 42:06.000]  is here or national media they pretty much quake and say
[42:06.000 --> 42:10.000]  you don't deserve this much power you're dangerous everyone's listening to you
[42:10.000 --> 42:14.000]  no one's listening to us they're only listening to me because I'm a messenger
[42:14.000 --> 42:18.000]  telling the truth I am nobody do you understand that
[42:18.000 --> 42:22.000]  but I can declare to the whole world right now
[42:22.000 --> 42:26.000]  that we have gotten out of the enemy's grasp
[42:26.000 --> 42:30.000]  because now the paradigm is understood by hundreds of other talk show hosts
[42:30.000 --> 42:34.000]  and millions of people and writers and bloggers and
[42:34.000 --> 42:38.000]  seeing things from the globalist perspective from their command center
[42:38.000 --> 42:42.000]  as we have basically been able to reverse engineer once that genie
[42:42.000 --> 42:46.000]  is out of the bottle once that secret is released the enemy
[42:46.000 --> 42:50.000]  cannot shut us down nothing they can do can stop us at the point we've now
[42:50.000 --> 42:54.000]  reached and it's important for the enemy
[42:54.000 --> 42:58.000]  of humanity the enemy of progress the it is
[42:58.000 --> 43:02.000]  important for the accuser it is important for
[43:02.000 --> 43:06.000]  the globalist to understand that you will not
[43:06.000 --> 43:10.000]  succeed and I know in your literature you say you'll just blow the planet
[43:10.000 --> 43:14.000]  up rather than not take over and succeed we'll see if you're able to do that
[43:14.000 --> 43:18.000]  because your own people right below you in many cases now realize what's happening
[43:18.000 --> 43:22.000]  they understand where this is going and they're only looking for more support
[43:22.000 --> 43:26.000]  to bring you down and you know that you're scared you should be
[43:26.000 --> 43:30.000]  you're trying to accelerate your program all that's going to do is wake people up faster
[43:30.000 --> 43:34.000]  what's going to happen is everything we've talked about comes true already so much of it
[43:34.000 --> 43:38.000]  has that people now understand we know what
[43:38.000 --> 43:42.000]  we're talking about what are you going to do new world order I'm like a cop
[43:42.000 --> 43:46.000]  with a bullhorn to a bunch of bank robbers that have got hostages inside a building
[43:46.000 --> 43:50.000]  and I'm out here on the bullhorn going we know who you are you may hurt those people inside
[43:50.000 --> 43:54.000]  but you're not going to get out of here in the end we know exactly how you operate
[43:54.000 --> 43:58.000]  and then I just sit here and talk to them about what they like what they do
[43:58.000 --> 44:02.000]  that I understand their mindset that I know what
[44:02.000 --> 44:06.000]  we can beat these people if we get aggressive
[44:06.000 --> 44:10.000]  and if we get the truth out and if we warn people and if we're leaders
[44:10.000 --> 44:14.000]  we can turn the tide but for this show
[44:14.000 --> 44:18.000]  and info wars I can declare in 2015
[44:18.000 --> 44:22.000]  on the 22nd day of May that this operation
[44:22.000 --> 44:26.000]  has hit the enemy directly between the eyes
[44:26.000 --> 44:30.000]  we've hit Goliath directly between the eyes but he's only stunned
[44:30.000 --> 44:34.000]  he's only been knocked to the ground politically we've got about one minute
[44:34.000 --> 44:38.000]  to get over there with that sword while his supporters
[44:38.000 --> 44:42.000]  are stunned and heft that sword up not violently but in the info war
[44:42.000 --> 44:46.000]  and sever the globalist head
[44:46.000 --> 44:50.000]  but even if we don't do that everyone has seen what
[44:50.000 --> 44:54.000]  the underdog can do the paradigm is shifting you can feel it
[44:54.000 --> 44:58.000]  and I talk about the anxiety I have and the concerns I have
[44:58.000 --> 45:02.000]  and that's because I can feel the enemy moving in a counter-offensive
[45:02.000 --> 45:06.000]  lashing out expanding driving all of their programs
[45:06.000 --> 45:10.000]  in a hysterical frenzy against humanity
[45:10.000 --> 45:14.000]  now that's it
[45:14.000 --> 45:18.000]  yesterday we were out protesting doing a live feed with Jakar Jackson leading the event
[45:18.000 --> 45:22.000]  we just joined us and I'm seeing a live feed and as we go
[45:22.000 --> 45:26.000]  to break I say that looks like anarchists
[45:26.000 --> 45:30.000]  well communists that will say they're anarchists and then as soon as I get out
[45:30.000 --> 45:34.000]  there because they were going after our folks grabbing the signs
[45:34.000 --> 45:38.000]  covering things up, shoving people, shoving David Knight's wife
[45:38.000 --> 45:42.000]  I went down there, David Knight took over and
[45:42.000 --> 45:46.000]  I pull up and immediately they start cussing at us, pushing us, shoving us
[45:46.000 --> 45:50.000]  they lock arms trying to run a bunch of people down
[45:50.000 --> 45:54.000]  they grab the microphone once, I grab it back, they grab it again later
[45:54.000 --> 45:58.000]  one of them punched me in the chest, another one clawed me on the arm
[45:58.000 --> 46:02.000]  and they were just stumbling around like reanimated corpses
[46:02.000 --> 46:06.000]  it was so sad to see these former humans just devoid
[46:06.000 --> 46:10.000]  of souls, the only time they feel alive studying their mindset
[46:10.000 --> 46:14.000]  is when they're doing something really nasty or evil or declaring something that's
[46:14.000 --> 46:18.000]  abomination and whether you believe in God or not, the archetypes
[46:18.000 --> 46:22.000]  real in a union way because they are manifesting
[46:22.000 --> 46:26.000]  like a moth to flame, just evil, evil, evil
[46:26.000 --> 46:30.000]  I kill my babies, the group they're part of
[46:30.000 --> 46:34.000]  you go to their Facebook, we're going to put some on screen, shows
[46:34.000 --> 46:38.000]  Red Guards Austin, it's a Maoist group
[46:38.000 --> 46:42.000]  after the police, I saw some signs on there, kill the police, some other signs
[46:42.000 --> 46:46.000]  that said, you know, hands up with your rifle, take on the police, all this kind of stuff
[46:46.000 --> 46:50.000]  and how horrible the Austin police
[46:50.000 --> 46:54.000]  department is and just burning American flags, hammers and sickles
[46:54.000 --> 46:58.000]  Malinlin and tattoos, all their little
[46:58.000 --> 47:02.000]  UT communist meetings donate to end capitalism
[47:02.000 --> 47:06.000]  unless they took it down, I know we have screenshots of the one, there's one that says
[47:06.000 --> 47:10.000]  kill the police and there's one that says shoot the police, so can we please
[47:10.000 --> 47:14.000]  earlier I wanted those, that's what I want, number one maximum I need that from the beginning
[47:14.000 --> 47:18.000]  of the show or have the crew in there, go get them for me and bring them in
[47:18.000 --> 47:22.000]  okay, now I want to go ahead and go to this first
[47:22.000 --> 47:26.000]  clip, I want to play the shorter clip, not the big montage
[47:26.000 --> 47:30.000]  of two leaders of it, I guess I think their boyfriend
[47:30.000 --> 47:34.000]  girlfriend, one white guy and one mixed girl
[47:34.000 --> 47:38.000]  who is sitting there talking about how he gets money in a community
[47:38.000 --> 47:42.000]  to pay for abortions, he's killed 50, and then another
[47:42.000 --> 47:46.000]  and then his girlfriend, who we believe is his girlfriend, says that
[47:46.000 --> 47:50.000]  she's killed her baby, she kills her baby, she doesn't have babies and it's David Knight's wife
[47:50.000 --> 47:54.000]  who's a very loving sweet lady who tried to adopt black babies, they wouldn't let her
[47:54.000 --> 47:58.000]  she couldn't have children, so they got a sweet young girl who's 13 years old now
[47:58.000 --> 48:02.000]  from China, who was basically starving an orphanage
[48:02.000 --> 48:06.000]  and she says, yeah that's you white people trying to save the world, no they're just loving Christians
[48:06.000 --> 48:10.000]  that wanted to have children, and as soon as they adopted, God blessed them and they
[48:10.000 --> 48:14.000]  had their son, and then they adopted another child
[48:14.000 --> 48:18.000]  so they're just really sweet and nice smart people, and like demon
[48:18.000 --> 48:30.000]  he's hissing at him, so I want to play that clip, here it is.
[48:30.000 --> 48:34.000]  Kill babies, I pay for that. I pay all my money for that.
[48:34.000 --> 48:38.000]  I get free abortions on demand without apology.
[48:38.000 --> 48:42.000]  Yup, and I'm going to hell. Yeah, I still pay to kill babies though.
[48:42.000 --> 48:48.000]  Oh yeah. How do you get your abortions paid for? I pay for them. I thought you said free.
[48:48.000 --> 48:52.000]  I pay for them. Upwards of 50. Really? Oh yeah.
[48:52.000 --> 48:56.000]  Wow, you must make money. I raise money from the community for it. Oh, you don't use your money?
[48:56.000 --> 48:59.000]  Yup. You multiply your efforts, huh?
[48:59.000 --> 49:04.000]  Why are you so worried about a fucking zygote? Ultimately your sympathies do not lie with black people,
[49:04.000 --> 49:07.000]  they lie with your racist white middle class agenda, and that's where we'll always lie,
[49:07.000 --> 49:11.000]  and you will be destroyed holding that line. Okay, I adopted to children.
[49:11.000 --> 49:16.000]  Oh, good for you, white savior. Aren't you so proud you're fucking white?
[49:16.000 --> 49:20.000]  Exactly, he's not white. Exactly, you're a white savior.
[49:20.000 --> 49:24.000]  You think that it is the white man's duty to fix everybody's problems, right?
[49:24.000 --> 49:29.000]  How many did you adopt? How many? How many did I adopt? I kill my kids.
[49:29.000 --> 49:33.000]  How many? How many did I adopt? I kill my kids.
[49:33.000 --> 49:43.000]  I kill my kids. Then we show shots of the website,
[49:43.000 --> 49:47.000]  and they did find it to kill the police stuff on the Facebook.
[49:47.000 --> 49:49.000]  We're gonna put that up here in just a moment.
[49:49.000 --> 49:53.000]  Sir, I saw one of the minions was attacking you. What was it? Did you see the look in their eyes?
[49:53.000 --> 49:56.000]  Praise, look, just out in space. I mean, the guy had...
[49:56.000 --> 49:59.000]  I mean, it's beyond the stuff I've seen from the Manson family.
[49:59.000 --> 50:04.000]  I mean, look, they're nothing. They are nothing.
[50:04.000 --> 50:07.000]  I can see your soul. I love you. I love you, too. God bless you.
[50:07.000 --> 50:09.000]  We're gonna beat these people. I hate the New World Order.
[50:09.000 --> 50:11.000]  He's the name. Yeah. Damn right.
[50:11.000 --> 50:14.000]  Whoa! Get it. People ask me why I'm a Christian, why I talk about God.
[50:14.000 --> 50:17.000]  I don't mean these fake churches. I face the New World Order over and over again.
[50:17.000 --> 50:22.000]  They're all devil worshipers. We know who they are, and we're sick out of them.
[50:22.000 --> 50:25.000]  You've been ousted. We see you hurting children, you filth.
[50:25.000 --> 50:29.000]  We see you. We see you as humanity's rising.
[50:29.000 --> 50:33.000]  You stop, impact us, and tell us to submit. We'll never submit to you.
[50:33.000 --> 50:35.000]  And humanity's rising. That's right.
[50:35.000 --> 50:39.000]  And God sees everything. Damn right. God sees everything.
[50:39.000 --> 50:43.000]  Now, if you're a radio listener, we're playing audio here,
[50:43.000 --> 50:46.000]  but you can see the video at infowars.com forward slash show.
[50:46.000 --> 50:49.000]  I'm gonna skip this network break, but the last one I've skipped a whole bunch this week.
[50:49.000 --> 50:52.000]  It's out of control. I apologize.
[50:52.000 --> 50:56.000]  Now, you have to understand that they're not joking around when they're saying this.
[50:56.000 --> 51:00.000]  They're very, very serious, and it's religious.
[51:00.000 --> 51:03.000]  And there is a sick, demonic power in killing your child,
[51:03.000 --> 51:06.000]  especially if you don't repent.
[51:06.000 --> 51:10.000]  We did find the photos on the Red Guards Austin site where it says,
[51:10.000 --> 51:16.000]  you know, get your guns, rise up, arms up, shoot back, solidarity with Ferguson.
[51:16.000 --> 51:20.000]  And then I saw another one on there where it says, kill the police.
[51:20.000 --> 51:26.000]  So they may have taken it down, but the point is that that is on the website.
[51:26.000 --> 51:30.000]  That is the type of stuff that is being pushed.
[51:30.000 --> 51:34.000]  Wage, people's war against the pigs, the police, the enemy.
[51:34.000 --> 51:37.000]  And then you were finally finding some of these.
[51:37.000 --> 51:43.000]  And then they've got dead pig heads hanging up at their demonstrations.
[51:43.000 --> 51:48.000]  I mean, this is just unbelievable. And they even like North Korea.
[51:48.000 --> 51:52.000]  I mean, talk about tyranny, some weird little 30-year-old fat guy
[51:52.000 --> 51:55.000]  walking around killing people with anti-aircraft guns.
[51:55.000 --> 51:58.000]  I mean, look at that one with all the children worshiping Mao,
[51:58.000 --> 52:00.000]  the painting right there on the right-hand side, middle.
[52:00.000 --> 52:02.000]  Yeah, click on that one. That's it.
[52:02.000 --> 52:04.000]  I mean, this is bizarro land.
[52:04.000 --> 52:07.000]  Mao was kicked out by the Communist in China.
[52:07.000 --> 52:10.000]  He killed the Chinese government, says 84 million.
[52:10.000 --> 52:12.000]  CIA says 65 million.
[52:12.000 --> 52:14.000]  By the way, who likes Mao?
[52:14.000 --> 52:19.000]  David Rockefeller wrote an op-ed praising him when he died in the New York Times.
[52:19.000 --> 52:24.000]  Just type in New York Times, David Rockefeller, Mao Zedong.
[52:24.000 --> 52:27.000]  You'll get the full-scanned New York Times.
[52:27.000 --> 52:31.000]  I mean, these, they're just into anything nasty and bad.
[52:31.000 --> 52:34.000]  In fact, can we pull up the former Green Beret, Larry Grathwald,
[52:34.000 --> 52:38.000]  who just died last year, who infiltrated and helped convict a weatherman.
[52:38.000 --> 52:40.000]  And he was in these meetings with them where they were talking about
[52:40.000 --> 52:42.000]  how they're going to put 50 million of us in slave camps
[52:42.000 --> 52:44.000]  and kill half of us that are in the slave camp.
[52:44.000 --> 52:47.000]  That was in the 70s. These are Obama's advisors.
[52:47.000 --> 52:49.000]  Obama came out of this.
[52:49.000 --> 52:53.000]  This isn't some, some, some miscreant subset.
[52:53.000 --> 52:57.000]  This is what you run into when you go to a campus.
[52:57.000 --> 53:00.000]  These are the enforcers that go hang out with the professors
[53:00.000 --> 53:03.000]  and sit around and discuss this stuff all day.
[53:03.000 --> 53:05.000]  They're lovers of death.
[53:05.000 --> 53:07.000]  Truly, truly, truly sick.
[53:07.000 --> 53:09.000]  And I told you, they're lovers of death.
[53:09.000 --> 53:11.000]  That's why they're out there at an abortion clinic.
[53:11.000 --> 53:13.000]  It's not about women's rights, not about choice.
[53:13.000 --> 53:15.000]  It's not about any of that.
[53:15.000 --> 53:18.000]  It is about killing your own children.
[53:18.000 --> 53:22.000]  I want to go ahead and air at least part of this montage video.
[53:22.000 --> 53:25.000]  I'll narrate some of the parts that don't translate well for radio
[53:25.000 --> 53:27.000]  from what happened.
[53:27.000 --> 53:33.000]  A bizarre, shocking video as communist as, as, as, as hellraiser rats.
[53:33.000 --> 53:37.000]  He's like the bugs that would run out from under a demon.
[53:37.000 --> 53:42.000]  You know, out of the pit of hell, out of like a dead horse on the side of the road, maggots.
[53:42.000 --> 53:44.000]  And I mean, these are names that describe them
[53:44.000 --> 53:49.000]  because you've got to be around them to feel the aura of weakness and in failure
[53:49.000 --> 53:52.000]  and just how, how, how they're so weak and so soulless
[53:52.000 --> 53:57.000]  that they've just given themselves to the worst thing they can hoping for power.
[53:57.000 --> 54:01.000]  And then they can't hide the fact that they're so nasty.
[54:01.000 --> 54:05.000]  But let's go ahead and again, the one menu they sent against us was like,
[54:05.000 --> 54:10.000]  out of a movie, a zombie with translucent white skin and dead eyes going,
[54:10.000 --> 54:14.000]  just bumping into people and he wasn't acting.
[54:14.000 --> 54:16.000]  He was just mind blown.
[54:16.000 --> 54:22.000]  This is what the devil can send against us when we're out there trying to save children.
[54:22.000 --> 54:26.000]  And then I love how, in fact, I'll play the montage coming up the next hour.
[54:26.000 --> 54:32.000]  Back it up to the clip we just played where David Knight's wife is like lovingly going,
[54:32.000 --> 54:38.000]  so I, I, she reminds me of my grandfather's mother.
[54:38.000 --> 54:41.000]  Not that she's old, but just that she was so sweet and so letty-like,
[54:41.000 --> 54:45.000]  but not fake sweet, like just genuinely super sweet.
[54:45.000 --> 54:48.000]  So sweet you could just like, you know, just hug them and sing into them.
[54:48.000 --> 54:51.000]  And when she's making me cookies or lunch or something,
[54:51.000 --> 54:54.000]  and she's like, oh, you know, I'm not racist.
[54:54.000 --> 54:58.000]  I, I want to, I tried to adopt minority children and I did.
[54:58.000 --> 55:02.000]  Shut up, you racist. I'm trying to help people. We just want to kill them.
[55:02.000 --> 55:04.000]  I killed my baby.
[55:04.000 --> 55:06.000]  I mean, yeah.
[55:06.000 --> 55:08.000]  Your mother's in hell.
[55:08.000 --> 55:10.000]  Your mother does such and such in hell.
[55:10.000 --> 55:12.000]  Let me spew some.
[55:12.000 --> 55:14.000]  I'll get you and your little dog too.
[55:14.000 --> 55:16.000]  Jumps on a broom.
[55:16.000 --> 55:19.000]  These are not liberals.
[55:19.000 --> 55:23.000]  I keep telling you they're death worshipers.
[55:23.000 --> 55:27.000]  The secret police would come in to linen who they worship and would say,
[55:27.000 --> 55:29.000]  we've killed half of the people in this town.
[55:29.000 --> 55:32.000]  And we're raping the women, we're taking them to camps, we're slaughtering.
[55:32.000 --> 55:34.000]  And, you know, everyone's submitting.
[55:34.000 --> 55:36.000]  No one even rebelled.
[55:36.000 --> 55:38.000]  And he would say, I want more blood.
[55:38.000 --> 55:40.000]  I want more terror.
[55:40.000 --> 55:44.000]  More. This is in mainline Russian books put out by them.
[55:44.000 --> 55:46.000]  And he would start flopping around the ground going,
[55:46.000 --> 55:49.000]  blood, blood, and he would go to an island.
[55:49.000 --> 55:55.000]  That's why in what's the movie with the dude and Clint Eastwood,
[55:55.000 --> 55:57.000]  where they're bank robbers at the end.
[55:57.000 --> 55:59.000]  He dies because he's had his head knocked in.
[55:59.000 --> 56:01.000]  It's a really good movie.
[56:01.000 --> 56:05.000]  There they a crazy guy pulls over his car and opens the trunk.
[56:05.000 --> 56:08.000]  It's white rabbits start pouring out and he's shooting them with a shotgun.
[56:08.000 --> 56:10.000]  Real crazy.
[56:10.000 --> 56:13.000]  That's actually from V.I. Lennon.
[56:13.000 --> 56:17.000]  He would go to this little island over popularly with rabbits and would just shoot them
[56:17.000 --> 56:20.000]  and cut them and eat them and just flop around for hours.
[56:20.000 --> 56:24.000]  I mean, I mean, that's what you're dealing with.
[56:24.000 --> 56:29.000]  So let's go ahead and go back to her when she thinks with her power.
[56:29.000 --> 56:31.000]  I'm going to lecture you.
[56:31.000 --> 56:33.000]  I'm going to call you a racist.
[56:33.000 --> 56:35.000]  I've never probably even had a job.
[56:35.000 --> 56:38.000]  I'm, you know, lavish with UT and all the rest of it.
[56:38.000 --> 56:41.000]  And I sit around dreaming of red terror.
[56:41.000 --> 56:43.000]  But I'm going to point my finger at you,
[56:43.000 --> 56:46.000]  a woman who saved a starving child from an orphanage.
[56:46.000 --> 56:50.000]  I'm going to point my finger at you and I'm going to tell you I got the moral high ground
[56:50.000 --> 56:52.000]  and most people just bow.
[56:52.000 --> 56:54.000]  Oh my gosh, you're a nobody filled with evil.
[56:54.000 --> 56:55.000]  Let me bow to you.
[56:55.000 --> 56:56.000]  No.
[56:56.000 --> 56:59.000]  Stop bowing to them.
[56:59.000 --> 57:01.000]  Stop being intimidated by them.
[57:01.000 --> 57:03.000]  Let's play the demon again.
[57:03.000 --> 57:04.000]  I'm worried about a zygote.
[57:04.000 --> 57:07.000]  And ultimately your sympathies do not lie with black people.
[57:07.000 --> 57:10.000]  They lie with your racist white middle class agenda and that's where we'll always lie.
[57:10.000 --> 57:12.000]  And you will be destroyed holding that line.
[57:12.000 --> 57:13.000]  Okay.
[57:13.000 --> 57:15.000]  I adopted two children.
[57:15.000 --> 57:16.000]  Oh, good for you.
[57:16.000 --> 57:17.000]  White savior.
[57:17.000 --> 57:18.000]  Aren't you so proud?
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.000]  They're not white.
[57:20.000 --> 57:22.000]  Exactly, he's not white.
[57:22.000 --> 57:23.000]  Exactly.
[57:23.000 --> 57:24.000]  You're a white savior.
[57:24.000 --> 57:28.000]  You think that it is the white man's duty to fix everybody's problems, right?
[57:28.000 --> 57:30.000]  How many did you adopt?
[57:30.000 --> 57:31.000]  How many did I adopt?
[57:31.000 --> 57:33.000]  I killed my kids.
[57:33.000 --> 57:35.000]  How many did I adopt?
[57:35.000 --> 57:37.000]  I killed my kids.
[57:37.000 --> 57:41.000]  I killed my kids.
[57:41.000 --> 57:43.000]  All right, that's enough.
[57:43.000 --> 57:45.000]  And these people are all over the country.
[57:45.000 --> 57:49.000]  In fact, I'm going to start sending my reporters out to these anarchist things.
[57:49.000 --> 57:52.000]  We're going to track back how these different groups are funded by the Obama Administration,
[57:52.000 --> 57:56.000]  Justice Department, groups like that, Soros.
[57:56.000 --> 58:00.000]  We're going to go to Bright, come back, get into other world news, and then we'll revisit
[58:00.000 --> 58:04.000]  this at the bottom of the hour and get some of the witnesses in here to this.
[58:04.000 --> 58:08.000]  But I haven't gotten any really dramatic footage or information yet.
[58:08.000 --> 58:11.000]  You need to understand what we're facing, what we're dealing with.
[58:11.000 --> 58:17.000]  They're abject pit of hell control freak nobodies who think that they're going to be like communists
[58:17.000 --> 58:19.000]  who take over and rule.
[58:19.000 --> 58:21.000]  I mean, it is just unbelievable.
[58:21.000 --> 58:25.000]  Briefly, if you want to fund our operation that's funded by the people, high quality products,
[58:25.000 --> 58:27.000]  the special ends this Sunday.
[58:27.000 --> 58:31.000]  We've got 20% off super male and super female vitality,
[58:31.000 --> 58:35.000]  and a lot of other specials at infowarslife.com with the high quality nutraceuticals.
[58:35.000 --> 58:36.000]  Thank you all for your support.
[58:36.000 --> 58:40.000]  infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[58:40.000 --> 58:42.000]  Stay with us.
[58:42.000 --> 58:49.000]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:49.000 --> 58:50.000]  I want more candy.
[58:50.000 --> 58:51.000]  I want more video games.
[58:51.000 --> 58:52.000]  Line, line, line.
[58:52.000 --> 58:57.000]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true
[58:57.000 --> 59:02.000]  nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[59:02.000 --> 59:05.000]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[59:05.000 --> 59:08.000]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[59:08.000 --> 59:13.000]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily
[59:13.000 --> 59:14.000]  by globalist concoctions.
[59:14.000 --> 59:19.000]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[59:19.000 --> 59:24.000]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients
[59:24.000 --> 59:26.000]  that children would actually like and take.
[59:26.000 --> 59:30.000]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for
[59:30.000 --> 59:34.000]  children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there,
[59:34.000 --> 59:39.000]  using child ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm
[59:39.000 --> 59:41.000]  and essential nutrients that taste great.
[59:41.000 --> 59:45.000]  Obtain your child ease today at infowarslife.com.
[59:45.000 --> 01:00:05.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:10.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:32.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:38.000]  You want to know what American universities owned and run by the big mega banks are doing?
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:47.000]  They're creating glow-in-the-dark communists of the most servile and pathetic type
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  who've never probably worked a day in their life.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:55.000]  The way to disperse them is to have a helicopter drop job applications on them.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:59.000]  I'm going to air just a few minutes of this, then come back from break
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  and get into all the international and world news.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:06.000]  But we went out to a pro-life demonstration yesterday that we organized.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000]  And the communists showed up and tried to block free speech,
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000]  grabbed our microphone, assaulted people,
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000]  and then began to tell us how they love Satan.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000]  I haven't gotten to all those clips yet.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:17.000]  And how they weren't the red brigade and weren't a communist
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:22.000]  and how we were conspiracy theorists, even though we have all the photos.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.000]  And then the police basically pampered them and allowed them to assault people.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000]  I mean, it's just a fact.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  I mean, they haven't been arrested yet.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000]  I would have been.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  I've been arrested because I refuse to be in a free speech zone four or five times.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000]  I'm not here to bash the police.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000]  I was telling you, you know, you just follow orders, I guess,
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  because you go to their website, it talks about get arms,
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.000]  take the guns off the cops, then it goes on to basically say
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.000]  prepare for revolution against the police.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  And that's fine.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  That's their free speech until they say, you know, kill the police.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  But that's what's coming out of some of the ribs affiliated with this one,
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  or at least on this Facebook, and severed rotting pig heads at their events.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000]  I mean, this is, this is, this is macabre.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  This is a cultic.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  This is just evil.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:12.000]  So let's go ahead and play a few minutes of that clip and then huge news that just broke.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.000]  Conspiracy theories are causing militants to abandon ISIS.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.000]  Stay with us.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:44.000]  We're going to go out to break with some of the communist assault.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:03:01.000]  We need to.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  Excuse us.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000]  Oh, you got a chill.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:24.000]  Why are you so worried about a psycho?
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.000]  And ultimately your sympathies do not lie with black people.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000]  They lie with your racist white middle class agenda.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  And that's where we'll always lie.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000]  And you will be destroyed holding that line.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.000]  Okay, I adopted two children.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000]  Oh, good for you.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.000]  White savior.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000]  Aren't you so proud?
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000]  They're not white.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000]  Exactly.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000]  He's not white.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000]  Exactly.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  You're a white savior.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  You think that it is the white man's duty to fix everybody's problems, right?
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  How many did you adopt?
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.000]  How many?
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  How many did I adopt?
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000]  I kill my kids.
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  How many?
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000]  How many did I adopt?
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000]  I kill my kids.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  I kill my kids.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.000]  I pay for that.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  I pay all my money for that.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.000]  I get free abortions on demand without apology.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000]  And I'm going to hell.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  Yeah, I still pay to kill babies though.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  Really?
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000]  Oh, yeah.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  How do you get your abortions paid for?
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000]  I pay for them.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000]  I thought they said free.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  Upwards of 50.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  Really?
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000]  Oh, yeah.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.000]  Wow.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000]  I raise money from the community for it.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000]  Oh, you don't use your money?
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000]  You multiply your efforts, eh?
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:33.000]  Well, we're down here pointing out that all black lives matter, all lives matter.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:40.000]  And that the very people who want to literally wipe out black Americans through Planned Parenthood on record
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.000]  are the ones trying to create this whole race war and garbage off some of these tragedies.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000]  So we're pointing out the real organized genocide with the documented proof.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000]  We're talking a lot of great folks.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.000]  Sir, give us your take on all this.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:55.000]  Yeah, I think that we're going to continue forward as a country.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000]  Yeah, we need to...
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000]  Give us our...
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:03.000]  The latest example of liberal free speech oppression is brought to you by Kit Daniels
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.000]  in the article,
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:08.000]  Campus Police Intimidate Student Over Her Anti-Obama and Pro-Gun Signs.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.000]  A college student is suing her school after three campus cops and an administrator
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:17.000]  ordered her not to carry an anti-Obama sign and a pro-gun sign on campus without special permission.
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000]  Nicole Sanders, a student at Blynne College in Brenham, Texas,
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000]  was recently demonstrating with the signs when she was told she needed special permission for them
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000]  and had to stay in the college's free speech zone.
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:29.000]  I needed to fill out a form stating what I'm doing, where I'm doing it,
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000]  who's involved, and what outcome we were expecting, she said.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.000]  We have to wait until four administrators sign it.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.000]  In response, Sanders has filed a lawsuit against Blynne College stating
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.000]  its policies and their enforcement are unconstitutional.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:45.000]  This story is eerily similar to an incident at California Polytech earlier this year
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:50.000]  in which school officials were also requiring students to engage in First Amendment activities on campus
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000]  to apply for a free speech permit.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:56.000]  You can find more stories like these at infowars.com and prismplanet.com.

[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000]  I'm Alex Jones here.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:33.000]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionist, and chemist
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:38.000]  to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:42.000]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:47.000]  Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000]  with exciting new advances in nutraceutical science.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:56.000]  Visit infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000]  That's infowarslife.com.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:01.000]  I want more candy. I want more videos here. Why, why, why?
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:05.000]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:11.000]  to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.000]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.000]  Television music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.000]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:23.000]  and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.000]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000]  and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:33.000]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000]  that children would actually like and take.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.000]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:43.000]  that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:48.000]  Introducing Child Ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000]  and essential nutrients that taste great.

[01:07:54.000 --> 01:08:17.000]  That's Child Ease exclusively at infowarslife.com.
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000]  Thank you for riding shop done with us today.
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000]  Whether you're listening on AM and FM stations across the country
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:34.000]  or watching vmfullwars.com or some of the cable and TV systems
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.000]  that pick up the TV side of this transmission.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.000]  Don't forget the nightly news.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.000]  It'll be this evening, 7 o'clock central as it is weeknights.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:49.000]  And I will return this Sunday live, 4 to 6 p.m. central standard time.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:53.000]  I will be live in studio this Sunday.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:57.000]  Normally I'd probably take off the Sunday and tape a show or do a rebroadcast
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000]  on the eve of Memorial Day.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000]  But I didn't do the show last week.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.000]  David Knight did it.
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.000]  So it's important to do that Sunday show at least three times a month.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:13.000]  I did tape 15 minutes, I guess 20 minutes for the show that afternoon.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000]  So it was partially an original transmission.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000]  And then David did a great job.
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000]  I think sometimes better job than I do.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000]  And so that's why I like having him fill in.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:31.000]  Because David Knight, Jacarie Jackson, Rob Do, John Bown, Leanne McAdoo,
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:38.000]  the writers, the crew behind the scenes, they all have a lot to contribute and add as well.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:43.000]  I'm just here to try to give historical perspective and also fire folks up in the face of an enemy onslaught.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.000]  And I do that naturally because I'm fired up.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000]  Let me just say in the gym this morning,
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:52.000]  I worked out for an hour and a half and did not stop.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000]  Except for maybe like two or three one minute breaks.
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.000]  I was throwing those weights around like nothing.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.000]  I mean, I was just ready to add some.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:07.000]  I mean, I need to get out more often and get in the face of scum because it energized me.
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:14.000]  If you just joined us, I'm about to get into some fabulously positive news.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.000]  It's as good a news as the feds coming out a month ago and saying, yeah,
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:23.000]  we're going to cut the fluoride completely out of pesticide and cut it by half in water
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.000]  because it's causing brain cancer and a bunch of other stuff.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000]  Just devastating victory.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:32.000]  Oh, I thought we were conspiracy theorists.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000]  I thought we were evil.
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.000]  I thought we were bad.
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:39.000]  I thought that we were, you know, these terrible, horrible people.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000]  No, the truth is we know what's going on.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:46.000]  We understand that those that love death, kind of the parents, the spiritual fathers and mothers
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:55.000]  of the type of scum I was covering in the last hour, they hate humanity.
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:02.000]  It's like Dr. Pionka at UT that says he wants to see Ebola release to kill 90% of us airborne weaponized
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:10.000]  or Prince Philip saying he wants to come back reincarnated as airborne Ebola to kill the majority of the population.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.000]  This is what they get off on.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:20.000]  This is what they are into.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:26.000]  And if you just joined us, what I'm speaking of is a pro-life demonstration that we launched to not just be the average milk toast
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:31.000]  pro-lifers that go out with some signs and talk about, hey, it's a baby and you're going to go to hell if you do this.
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:38.000]  But hey, this came from eugenicist who started it all to exterminate the black population.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.000]  Here's the quotes and Hitler was funded by these people.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000]  Their names are the Rockefellers and Margaret Sanger.
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:46.000]  And so understand a lot of the arguments you hear are false.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000]  Let's have a real discussion about this.
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:54.000]  I mean, we can't even get partial birth abortion stopped when you could adopt the baby at, you know, eight, nine months.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000]  I mean, this is out of control.
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000]  Now it's, yeah, get rid of old people.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  Yeah, now kill kids up to age three or five.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000]  Yeah, now don't give, you know, veterans treatment.
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000]  I mean, this is not ending.
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:10.000]  Slavs, Latin and Hebrew immigrants are human weeds, a dead weight of human waste.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000]  Blacks, soldiers and Jews.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:16.000]  Oh yeah, they, the elite always hate soldiers because you're, you're, you're strong.
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.000]  You'll fight.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000]  You generally come from the common folks.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.000]  Let me read her quote again.
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.000]  I'm sorry.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:25.000]  Slavs, Latin, all Hispanics, she wants to kill you.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.000]  Slavs, she hates you because Slavs are so strong.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.000]  And Hebrew immigrants, I'm going to read all this again.
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:39.000]  Slavs, Latin and Hebrew immigrants are human weeds and dead weight of human waste.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.000]  No, you're human waste.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  You piece of crap.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.000]  Excuse me.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000]  See, I'm pro human.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.000]  These are the real racist.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  These death lovers, they want to kill little kids and they sit there and tell us we're racist.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:56.000]  I take that as a badge of honor by the scum to call me that because it's a total fraud.
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000]  They're the anti humans, the human race.
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  They're against our race.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.000]  They think they're going to merge with computers and become gods.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.000]  They think we're ugly.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000]  You're the ones that are ugly.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000]  You hate yourselves.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.000]  You hate us.
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.000]  I love myself.
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.000]  I love humanity.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000]  I'm proud of our achievements.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.000]  We're making God's image.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:20.000]  We're builders, master builders, constructors, beauty, mathematics, classical music.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000]  We're incredible.
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:26.000]  Our gods a trillion times more incredible, infinitely more.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:30.000]  Your God's a God of death that hates us because we're beautiful.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.000]  You filth.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  You trash.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.000]  Put her back on screen.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:39.000]  See, I said I have all this news, but slobs, Latin and Hebrew immigrants are human weeds,
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000]  a dead weight of human waste.
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:45.000]  Blacks, soldiers and Jews are a menace to the race.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:53.000]  This is the queen of the liberals, the God of the liberals.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:57.000]  She said that in 1922, ladies and gentlemen, in a major newspaper.
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:01.000]  I mean, this is all published.
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.000]  This woman reportedly dated one of the top Rockefellers.
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:09.000]  She was just one of these scags, one of these skanks that they picked up to run the op.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  There she is being saluted by the Ku Klux Klan.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:18.000]  I mean, I don't care if it's a black racist gang or a Mexican racist gang or the Klan.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:23.000]  It's all just gang members that want to organize these gangs and say they're the best because
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:29.000]  as individuals, they can't excel and have people want to support them and follow them naturally.
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:33.000]  And that's why you want to get everybody fighting with each other because you get power out
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:39.000]  of that instead of unifying humanity around strong freedom and strong families and strong
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:46.000]  private property and strong defense and raising our men to be strong, to be chivalrous and
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:52.000]  to be honorable to other men and women and to be living by their creed and their family name.
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:57.000]  But when you start a fight with them, they're ready to flip the switch and go from being
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:01.000]  Mr. Nice Guy that helps a little old lady around the street to not playing games and just grabbing
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:07.000]  you globalists right by your heads and taking your head down to that concrete and just bam, bam, bam.
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:11.000]  And watching your brain splatter all over the pavement will show you strength.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.000]  You think these little communists can sit there and break somebody's head open on the ground?
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:17.000]  They don't have any strength because their God is weak.
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:22.000]  And Christians have been taught to be pathetic, servile minions of this scum.
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.000]  That's not in the Bible. That's not what the prophets did. None of them.
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  Christ went into the money changers temple with a cat or nine tails and overturned tables
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:36.000]  and like beat up 25 people. Oh yeah, that's a real wimp right there.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:42.000]  Went in there was just kicking people, whipping them, throwing tables over on people, rampaging.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000]  And I'm not calling for violence.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:50.000]  I'm simply explaining the spirit of liberty and defense of human life that these people hate so much.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:57.000]  They hate us because spiritually they can see how strong and beautiful our souls are.
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:03.000]  I could see the souls of those men and women, black, white, Hispanic, the women that were out there.
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:08.000]  Even if they weren't some of them, you know, super classically Marilyn Monroe, beautiful or whatever.
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:16.000]  And they were all very, very pretty. Their eyes were on fire and were piercing and beautiful and strong these women.
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:21.000]  And then I look at the dead eyes of the enemies, women. I mean, it was just night and day.
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:27.000]  And the what I saw in those women's eyes is what I saw in my grandmother's eyes, both of them.
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:32.000]  That's a real woman right there. That's a strong, loving woman with a soul.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:41.000]  And then I see the men's eyes and I could then see their souls of the loving, good, strong people that understand what's valuable.
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.000]  They weren't watching David Letterman's last show.
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:51.000]  They weren't into, you know, sitting there playing fantasy football or basketball at work at lunch.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.000]  They were out there standing up for unborn children.
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:17:00.000]  So don't you ever thank me. I want to thank you. I want to salute you for how amazing you are.
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.000]  I am honored to be around such people.
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:07.000]  And you've got my commitment that I will do everything in my power
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:15.000]  to summon the will and the strength and the semantical repertoire to touch the hearts and minds of the people worldwide,
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:24.000]  to have humanity rise against the cult of death and rise against the wing of death and rise against this legion of evil.
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:35.000]  This legion of filth, the soulless, dead-eyed piles of trash, vampires sniffing around a facility where tens of thousands of babies
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:41.000]  have their lives snuffed out every single year.
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:48.000]  Vampires trying to warm their dead souls on the hot, beautiful souls going straight to God.
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:57.000]  They're there like Mazda Flame believing it's giving them power when all it is is them from afar,
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:03.000]  marooned on their little deserted island watching a cruise ship pass.
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:07.000]  You think you had victory over those children? You think you've had victory and power over them dying?
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000]  Cure up. I'm going to have to kill her own children.
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:14.000]  Your children are now free of your hard little grasp.
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:20.000]  I said I'd hit the nose. I'll tell you, there is some really important news today.
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:24.000]  We're going to devastate the globalists on every front.
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.000]  Conspiracy theorists are causing militants to abandon ISIS.
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:34.000]  Of course, the mainstream media is saying, oh no, ISIS isn't run by Western intelligence agencies,
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:38.000]  even though it publicly is, wanting them to get their recruitment.
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:44.000]  Radicals complain recruits are turning away as they discover Western intelligence controls extremist groups
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000]  in FullWars.com.
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:51.000]  A report of the official propaganda magazine of ISIS this month bemoans the fact that the terror group
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:54.000]  is losing members because of so-called conspiracy theories.
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:59.000]  Just like these communists said, your conspiracy theorists, we're not in a red brigade.
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:04.000]  They're all on their own website saying they're the leaders of their red guard.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:08.000]  The Western intelligence manipulates and controls extremists for its own agenda.
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.000]  And see ISIS is saying that now, and they put us in their videos.
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:15.000]  They're so upset that we're not letting them recruit young, dumb idiots.
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:21.000]  The International Business Times, see, we wage war against the enemy on every front.
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000]  And the truth is what trumps them.
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:28.000]  The International Business Times reports that the magazine, Dabiku, or however you pronounce it,
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:33.000]  condemns conspiracy theorists, referring to their ideas as beliefs as sinful.
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:36.000]  That's right, they're sitting there telling these poor dirt farmers and people, you know,
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:40.000]  that don't listen to them. They are sinful. They are Western intelligence.
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:47.000]  Western intelligence is on record funding the Free Syrian Army and funding al-Qaeda and ISIS
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:50.000]  and giving you the weapons and letting you take over for Saudi Arabia.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:55.000]  And we're going to continue to expose you no matter what you do and no matter how many threats you put out.
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:59.000]  We're coming for all of you in the Info War.
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:05.000]  Americans honor their war dead every year on Memorial Day, the last Monday in May of each year,
[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:11.000]  with a special remembrance and celebration, with flowers on the graves of our fallen heroes.
[01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:17.000]  Guns80.com is offering a very special price on an AR-15 kit with an aluminum lower
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:22.000]  and two 30-round magazines for only $450 for Memorial Day.

[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:34.000]  Are you tired of being cyber-raped by big government and big business?
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:40.000]  Are you tired of being forced to cough up information, private personal information against your will?
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:43.000]  Well, I found the answer to their invasive behaviors.

[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:33.000]  We the people grow cotton, we fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:37.000]  and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to serve as debt.
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:41.000]  This capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:44.000]  is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:48.000]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:01.000]  This is a nationwide announcement for consumers owing back taxes to the IRS.
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:05.000]  The slowdown in the U.S. economy is forced to renewed action by the Internal Revenue Service.
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:10.000]  The IRS is now accepting reduced settlement amounts from qualifying consumers who owe back taxes.
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:14.000]  If you're eligible, your back tax settlement may be discounted by thousands of dollars.
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:18.000]  A specially assigned national hotline has been directly routed to defense tax group.
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:22.000]  Consumers may now call and check the eligibility for a significant tax debt reduction.
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:25.000]  Financial stability is a major priority during this slow economy,
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:29.000]  so you're advised to dial this national hotline number now.

[01:23:53.000 --> 01:24:11.000]  800-678-4191.
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:38.000]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:42.000]  Well, Obama trades secret ahead of vote.
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:48.000]  And even the guy driving at Mitch McConnell, along with Boehner, in the house,
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:53.000]  says that he doesn't even know what's in the TPP himself. That's a quote.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:57.000]  So it's secret from you. He doesn't know what's in it.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000]  A bunch of foreign corporations run it.
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:05.000]  And if you go study those corporations, they're the ones that fund communism, socialism, and every other failed system,
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:09.000]  because they're all exempt from it offshore.
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:14.000]  Simply mind-blowing. It's up on infowars.com.
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:18.000]  The first trade bill narrowly clears. Key Senate hurdle.
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:23.000]  Deal details not released to public conservatives could push over the finish line.
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:29.000]  Mexico is weighing in on U.S. meat product sanctions. Congressional approval ratings collapse.
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:39.000]  That's from drudgereport.com. But, of course, the establishment doesn't care.
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:47.000]  Of course, because they work for different bosses than the United States.
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:50.000]  They work for the globalist.
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:54.000]  And again, you want to know who funds open borders? You want to know who funds going after our guns?
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000]  You want to know who funds breaking up the family?
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:03.000]  It's the big mega banks that push the anti-family, anti-male, anti-freedom agenda on every major channel they've got.
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:10.000]  Then they've got the nerve with all their snotty-nosed armies of trust fund kids running around in black outfits acting cool
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:19.000]  to say that they are fighting the establishment when the establishment is pushing what they themselves are exempt from.
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000]  That is the bottom line.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:32.000]  But the good news is, conspiracy theories are causing militants to abandon ISIS.
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:40.000]  The articles complain recruits are turning away as they discover western intelligence controls the groups.
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:50.000]  That's right. The International Business Times reports on the official al-Qaeda, now known as ISIS magazine.
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:57.000]  They go on to say, if the Mujahideen liberated territory occupied by the infidels, they would say that the infidels allowed them to do so
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:02.000]  because the disbelievers' interest is necessarily a prolonged war, the article states.
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:09.000]  According to these theories and theorists, almost all the events in the world somehow link back to the infidels,
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:15.000]  their intelligence agencies, research, technology and co-conspirators, the extremist rag proclaims.
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:22.000]  Conspiracy theories have thereby become an excuse to abandon Jihad, the peace-entitled conspiracy theory.
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:32.000]  Sin. See, I'm a sinner, folks. Info wars has long highlighted how al-Qaeda and ISIS, who they put us in their videos,
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:35.000]  I mean, they're talking about us. See, I'm out bragging, folks.
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:40.000]  Why is everybody talking about us? Hundreds of newspapers a day attacking us, governments attacking us,
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:46.000]  media matters attacking us, ISIS attacking us, putting Joe Biggs in their videos threatening him.
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:53.000]  Because we know the enemy blueprint. We have them. We have them targeted.
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:58.000]  But we're just, we're the targeting system. You are the weapon in the info war.
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:03.000]  You now have to expose them further and cause a mass awakening with your friends and family.
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:07.000]  We are on the verge of massive breakthroughs.
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:13.000]  And that's why the enemy is scrabbling and freaking out because they want to take us to the road to hell.
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:19.000]  We want the road to freedom.
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:27.000]  Info wars has long highlighted how al-Qaeda and ISIS are the very least used by intelligence agencies in a grand game of geopolitical chess.
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:34.000]  It is indispensable that al-Qaeda was seated by the CIA, indisputable, and that Saudi intelligence in the late 70s, early 80s,
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:38.000]  and that right through today, Western intelligence is funding it.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:51.000]  Clearly, the ISIS propaganda piece was published before it was revealed last week by Western intelligence that some of bin Laden himself was an avid conspiracy theorist.
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:29:00.000]  According to newly declassified U.S. government documents that goes into bin Laden's reading list, if you even believe that, that was his body double.
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:06.000]  Well, the real point here, and Steve did a good job, he can add this to this, is Colonel Shaper's been on. We've all documented it.
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:13.000]  The other headline is 90% of Free Syrian Army is Wahhabist al-Qaeda. That's who we've been funding.
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:27.000]  And then now they've just resupplied themselves going into Iraq and there to be given the western central area, the Kurds, the north, the Shiites, the southeast.
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:38.000]  That's it. And then if they get outside that area that they're being given into the Kurd area or into the Syrian areas they're not being given or into the Shiite areas they're not being given,
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:46.000]  they'll then be bombed and kept in place. It's kind of like doctors, they still do this for a really bad infection, they'll implant maggot eggs in your skin,
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000]  then they remove the maggots once they've eaten the right amount of meat.
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.000]  We're on the march, the dead meat.
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:55.000]  The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000]  We'll be right back to you.
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:33.000]  Fascinated with the myriad of 9-11 conspiracy theories, knowing that he himself had masterminded the attack.
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:42.000]  The other possibility is that the entire list has been completely fabricated in an effort to smear conspiracy theorists as terrorist sympathizers.
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:48.000]  Fun fact, you can actually find some of the books on Bin Laden's bookshelf right here at the InfoWars store.
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:58.000]  Terrorists, find out just what was on Bin Laden's bookshelf by reading the article Osama Bin Laden was a 9-11 truther at InfoWars.com.
[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:28.000]  Or because they're not 100% organic, or because they don't ask all of the strictest toxicology tests there are that we have listed at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:38.000]  Whether it's Survival Shield, nascent iodine, or DNA force, super male vitality, super female vitality, lung cleanse, fluoride shield, oxy powder.
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:49.000]  I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited InfoWarsLife.com and believed in us and tried the products.

[01:32:49.000 --> 01:33:14.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:38.000]  Listen to Baker Street, beautiful music coming out of beautiful minds playing these instruments. I'm a fan of humanity.
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:45.000]  I'm a fan of those 56 million babies in the U.S. alone exterminated by abortion.
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:55.000]  And I've learned protesting abortion clinics and following them that always people come over and say, I want to kill babies, I love Satan, I love communism, death, death, death.
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:59.000]  Whether they're black, white, or Hispanic, they always love death.
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:06.000]  We're going to play some of these videos coming up in the audio of your radio listener InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:18.000]  I wanted to get Anthony Gucciardi, who was there, his take on it all, and also Jakari Jackson, who was leading the demonstration until I came down and jumped in the middle of it because the listeners were all, why had Alex there if it's in Austin?
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:30.000]  And stuff started getting hot. Folks didn't wait for orders from headquarters, watching the live feed, our shipping department manager, a good friend of mine, Weldon Henson, went down there.
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:42.000]  And there's a good thing that he went down there and the Jakari was there, or I definitely was going to end up getting in a fight and defending myself with the Count Dracula guy because I guess he talked to, he was a big guy that I was scared of him.
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:49.000]  I came within one millisecond, the second time he shoved me and then he hit me. I went ahead and drew back. I was going to punch him right up under the jaw.
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:58.000]  I don't think that guy had any idea that the last four times, and I'm not exaggerating that I punched somebody full power in the jaw, broke their jaws.
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:07.000]  I mean, it's not hard. You punch somebody full power in the jaw. I mean, you break their jaw, you break their teeth off, and I, even though he was a soulless vampire, I did not want to hurt him.
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:16.000]  But he was assaulting me, and I just, within one millisecond, one millisecond of letting loose into his jaw.
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:26.000]  But I didn't. You could see it, maybe we could slow it down in the video, but I was just, and I tell you, then that would have turned him into martyrs, I guess.
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:34.000]  But thank God, everybody controlled themselves. They assaulted us. They broke the microphone. He came back and hit me again and then ran off.
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:41.000]  But that time, it wasn't that hard. He hit me and then grabbed the microphone. Like, pop, grabs the microphone.
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:46.000]  But again, it was the punch of about a 12-year-old. You know, let my son hit me all the time.
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:52.000]  He likes to come in the kitchen, you know, 12-year-olds are, and he'll haul off and hit me in the arm or whatever. I don't hit him back.
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:58.000]  And that actually hit me this morning. I actually hurt pretty bad. So I'm sorry. My 12-year-old son punches harder than this guy.
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:07.000]  So it's a total joke. And I'm not bragging. I've had my butt kicked plenty of times, but, you know, I go with these big guys and MMA guys, you know, the carnival, and they got those boxing deals,
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:12.000]  and I can knock it all the way to the top, and they can't. So the point is, I can punch pretty hard, not bragging.
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:20.000]  That guy came real close to getting his jaw broken, is all I'm saying. And I say I didn't want to do it. Let's just be honest. I kind of vacillate back and forth.
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:25.000]  He just, those people, I don't think I've ever had their ass beat. And I think me and Jakar were talking this morning.
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:30.000]  I think that was one of the major problems in their life, is that they just think they can go around bullying folks.
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:38.000]  And that's the larger message that I want to put across here is that these are bullies that tried to block our signs.
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:45.000]  These are bullies that broke our microphone and cable twice. These are bullies that were pushing over women.
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:51.000]  And these are bullies that were saying they love Satan. We haven't played this yet. That they're feminist.
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:57.000]  That they're not communists and I'm a liar, even though they lead a major communist group in Austin, according to them on their own Facebook.
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:01.000]  There's photos and video. Just everything they say is a lie and a distortion.
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:09.000]  And then mixed in is rise up with guns and go after the police with rotting pig heads like you'd see in some sci-fi dystopia movie, Road Warrior.
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:17.000]  I mean, except in a Road Warrior scenario, you wouldn't be living very long. It would be a bunch of veterans that were still alive.
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:26.000]  I mean, it is just, I mean, can you imagine these wimps in a real Road Warrior situation? I mean, what a joke. What an absolute joke.
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:36.000]  I'd be alive in a Road Warrior situation, not because of my brawn, but because I would organize people into a defense group, into a true system of liberty working together.
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:42.000]  They'd try to have some collective and make everybody be under one communist leader and they'd all starve to death like North Korea.
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:46.000]  These people, these people probably can't even wipe their own hind ends.
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:55.000]  But I'm digressing. You know, to Infowars.com and see the American flags being burned, Infowars publications being burned. This is what they do.
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:05.000]  Little did I know that I'm downtown eating and I see a fire down on Congress a few weeks ago and it was them burning my magazine and burning American flags.
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:12.000]  So see, I mean, ought to be honored that filth like this, pit of hell filth, hates me so much they're doing this.
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:23.000]  So this is what unfolded and they're vehement totalitarians and they, this is what, this is the mainstay at major universities where they're banning free speech.
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:34.000]  This is what's going on. And we're not on a power trip here when I explained that ISIS has matted us and making threatening videos because we're hurting their recruiting that the West let's happen to then overthrow countries.
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:44.000]  Because young Muslims are listening and not joining. They're hopping mad that we're exposing militarization of police and the military training to take on tea party and gun owners.
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:53.000]  So they're misrepresenting what we say there. You notice now every day we're affecting national, international news because we have the truth.
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:39:06.000]  It's not that we're cool. It's that we understand the globalist paradigm. It's not hard. Once you think of the system from their perspective of how they're operating with full spectrum dominance.
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:15.000]  It's like when you're opening a safe, you hear it click, you know it, you pull the lever, boom, the door opens. We've opened the safe. We've cracked the code.
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:25.000]  And guess what? It wasn't hard. I've read over 100 books written by Henry Kissinger and David Rockefeller and Zabignan Brzezinski and Carol Quigley.
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:39.000]  And it's all in there because their own minions have to know how to run this. They've got tens of thousands of high level minions, 6000 superclass about 18 families that own the Anglo-American system that nothing to do with white people.
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:50.000]  It's the name of the British East India, Dutch East India, Anglo-American Combine, Anglo-American Dutch oil. It's a cartel and they've got ways to take over countries.
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:58.000]  They send in operatives. They spy on the population. They then train people out of fight with each other. They hire community organizers. So they took over India.
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:11.000]  Less than 5000 Brits using this were able to take over India when it had over 100 million people. Now it's a billion. I mean, we understand their operation. We're blowing their operation.
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:22.000]  We're going to continue to blow their operation. You understand that? We're the organic response. How dare them call us racist when we're there trying to stop 51% of black people who've been aborted since Roe v. Wade.
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:31.000]  They're the racist against the human race. They want you to think only about skin color instead of about how we're all being screwed over by foreign banks.
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:41.000]  I want to play this clip and then get Jakari Jackson and, of course, Anthony Gootsy already take on all this. But first off, we are funded by you.
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:41:01.000]  Nowhere can you spend your money. I mean, I can say this 100% certainty. Nowhere can you spend your money more supporting a media operation that is viciously honest, viciously truthful, viciously fearless, double tough and committed 110% foaming at the mouth prohuman.
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:13.000]  We're rapidly fighting. And we're rabid because we know humanity's being torn to shreds, folks. We got to surge. We got to get angry. We got to take the enemy on in the Info War and be aggressive and be leaders.
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:21.000]  And people are ready to listen. They're ready to wake up. They're ready. But you can't be milk toast. You got to break people out of their trance.
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:27.000]  We have high quality pro-gun t-shirts to wear your collars loud and proud and meet fellow Info Warriors.
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:36.000]  You want to meet like-minded folks? We're an Info War shirt in public. We got long-sleeve shirt, sheave, Molan lobby, Made in America, you name it, InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:42.000]  We've got high quality water filtration systems that will cut out the glyphosates and other soft-kill weapons and the fluoride.
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:59.000]  We've got all the great products, shortwave radios, non-GMO seeds, cook stoves, high quality, durable foods, lowest prices, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:04.000]  And here's the most important point. 42 hours left. It ends Sunday evening. We will end it.
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:17.000]  One another sale for probably six months on SuperMail or SuperFillment Vitality. 20% off the highest quality herbs that simply go in and block what the globalists have been doing with their estrogen mimicers and all the rest of the crowd.
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:24.000]  This is what you're supposed to feel like. You can go out and look at top sites, you know, reviewing these and just saying they are the best out there.
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:35.000]  We've got five-star ratings, top-tested, totally pure, over-the-top, passes California's highest standards. This is the Rolls Royce because we know we're targets, but that's not really why.
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:44.000]  We would already put out the best because I treat people like I want to be treated. You got that? I treat people like I want to be treated, the golden rule, and this is the best.
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:55.000]  Plus, then, it is the best so it becomes incredibly popular and you keep buying it, fighting the operation, win-win. InfowarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:43:03.000]  42 hours left on that sale. There's some other sales. Check them all out at InfowarsStore.com and support the Infowar. God bless you all.
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:07.000]  All right. I'm ranting. Jacari Jackson, thank you for coming in with Anthony Gucciardi.
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:15.000]  Give me your take on this entire situation. What you witnessed. Have I exaggerated that these people look like vampires?
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:22.000]  No. That is by no means an exaggeration. We got out there early in the day and there's probably about 20 people.
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:29.000]  The crowd continued to grow as the day went on and these communists who deny they are communists, even though we have them on their Facebook page,
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:37.000]  which is claiming that they're communists and doing communist activities, they come out there. They're intimidating the crowd. They start out shoving people in the crowd with the signs.
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:45.000]  Then they continue on to intimidate women and young children. They even came up to David Knight's young daughter and we're trying to beast over her.
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:51.000]  She's like, get out of my face. And they also spit on her. And I'm sorry about seeing that. I would have gone ahead and hold off. I didn't know they did that.
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000]  Yeah, I didn't know that until later. Yeah.
[01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:59.000]  All that craziness happened. They tried to push a reefer seat who's a well-known Austin activist out into the street, an older gentleman.
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:08.000]  He's a sweet guy, but he has traumatic brain problem. He was hit by a car. He's an old cripple man. They were beating him up.
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000]  That's what I mean. They're scum.
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:19.000]  And that's what it came to because after all this stuff happened and they've been trying to bully people all day attacking old men, young ladies, older women.
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:24.000]  And I said, I had enough of it. So I jumped in the guy's face and I was like, you guys want to fight. You can come and fight me.
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:29.000]  And he didn't really want to do that. He is like, well, actually this is a guy who can actually defend himself.
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:34.000]  Maybe I should just go snatch the microphone and run off like the little girl that he was.
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000]  Well, it'll stop you mean the little girls.
[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:39.000]  Oh, yeah. David Knight's daughter stood up to him. So I guess.
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000]  A 13 year old girl stood up to him.
[01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:49.000]  And this is how these guys act. You know, then he runs off, runs around the corner, spikes the microphone, trying to break it. He gets away.
[01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:56.000]  They captured two of them. I believe it was the other, the main guy got away, the vampire looking guy. He was able to get away.
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:07.000]  I saw a lady's footage. I hope she uploads it to YouTube on her cell phone, the cop shop video, that video with their camera running with those vampires helping him climbing on a dumpster and jumping in somebody's backyard.
[01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:18.000]  I believe it. I believe it 100%. But mainly, you know, we don't want to get all the way off on this stuff because it was a day to come out and bring attention to the things that were happening in our communities.
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:25.000]  Because we all know hashtag Black Lives Matter is being used to bring attention to police brutality, which very much is real and happening.
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:29.000]  But they siphoned it off to Soros support and to fund these groups.
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:30.000]  Yeah.
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:36.000]  That's the problem is it's these people that are running the thing to reform the cops, not to reform them, but to have a violent revolution.
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:40.000]  Yeah, they do want a violent revolution until they actually are met with somebody who can stand against them.
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:43.000]  Because you noticed, Alex, you were right there in the middle of it.
[01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:46.000]  You know, these guys, they bow up, they link arms, they come in there looking for a fight.
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:50.000]  And then we said, okay, you want to fight? We'll give you one. And then they decided to run off.
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:55.000]  So I mean, if it's these, if these are the guys who are trying to take over our country and they think they're going to do it with some type of violence,
[01:45:55.000 --> 01:46:03.000]  I think we're very fortunate that these are the type of people we have to contend with because they're not looking for actual fight when they see somebody who's actually willing to stand against them.
[01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:04.000]  They just scurry off.
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:13.000]  And you notice the people who remain, they just sheepishly stood there by the fence, you know, hoping that nobody would mess with them for the rest of the, for the rest of the, for the rest of the protest.
[01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:23.000]  Well, then let me go further. And then I want to expand on this thing. I think it's Yardie and Jacari as well, covering the pro-loft demonstration that was attacked by communist vampires.
[01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:33.000]  That's what I described it yesterday. And we're going to play some of the clips of I love Satan, I love killing babies, all that coming up in just a moment. But I simply saw them running off.
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:40.000]  And then when our cameras followed them, they would just sit down and I said, oh, they don't want us to follow them because they're linking up with the vampire who's hiding in the woods.
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000]  The guy that went and jumped in the neighborhood.
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:49.000]  He ran over to the quick loop and climbed up the dumpster and literally jumped over, you know, those concrete walls that divide neighborhoods from the highway, 290.
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:54.000]  And so I wanted to find him because the cops wanted to arrest him. I told the cops, I'm going to go find him. I'll call you.
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:47:03.000]  So I had the guy's phone number. The cops said, okay, I'm waiting over here. We went over to go find them. Now they've put out stuff saying I'm putting out where they live and I'm coming after them.
[01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:06.000]  No, the guy assaulted us and broke my microphone.
[01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:07.000]  On camera.
[01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:13.000]  We're pressing charges. We're sending all the video to the police. Nobody's coming to your houses but the police. Okay.
[01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:19.000]  So then they go, we're going to publish where Alex Jones lives. And then they say all these places. I don't live.
[01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:25.000]  I don't live in the amily downtown. I don't live at this poor Alex Jones guy who called me four years ago.
[01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:33.000]  I said, please tell people that you don't live in Westlake and that there's 10 Alex Joneses in Austin. I have people every week at my house, please.
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000]  And I said, sir, they won't listen.
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:40.000]  So I know an Alex Jones guy that works for AP that moved out of Austin.
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:41.000]  Wow.
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:46.000]  Because of, I think his website Silver Spider or something for these idiot groups to actually call them and find out.
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:50.000]  I mean, you're really messing with different people. I mean, that's what's insane.
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:57.000]  That's what's totally crazy is that they sit there and they say where I live as if I'm afraid.
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:02.000]  I mean, I've got a fence, a gate, dogs and guns.
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:05.000]  It's you people ought to be afraid coming around my house.
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:10.000]  I mean, I know you're into death and everything, but let me tell you, anybody comes to my house around my family.
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:13.000]  Yeah, there's the poor Alex Jones has been harassed because of me and others.
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000]  That's not me, folks.
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:20.000]  You, if you got a death wish come around my house, I mean, there's not going to be any playing games.
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000]  I'm going to warn people right now. I will protect my family.
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000]  I think everybody will.
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:25.000]  And that's what they realize.
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000]  You're not too worried. Are you?
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000]  No, not at all.
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:33.000]  It was those guys, you know, I don't think I have much to worry about.
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:36.000]  Anthony Guciardi, what do you think of these people?
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:42.000]  You know, as a lover of humanity and a proponent and a researcher of self development, which is really just going
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:48.000]  and intellectually trying to figure out how we can help humanity and the things that we can do to advance the race as a whole.
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:52.000]  You know, it really concerns me when people result dirty tricks.
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:55.000]  So they're not coming out and they're not saying Alex, you know, I just agree with you because of this.
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:59.000]  So they're not actually saying anything forward us in any way.
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000]  They're just literally siphoning off energy.
[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:05.000]  They're coming and siphoning off your energy attacking you, assaulting you, stealing your microphone.
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:09.000]  And then threatening you online that they're going to show up at your house.
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000]  And saying I did that.
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000]  And then saying that you did that.
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:16.000]  Oh, they're not communists either. Everything they say is a lie.
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:24.000]  It's ultimately, it's funny you use the word vampire because remember a vampire, what they do is they suck blood and they suck life force from someone
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000]  because they don't have enough of their own.
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:29.000]  Ultimately, they die without stealing a life force system.
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:35.000]  So if a vampire, see, I'm the opposite, I'm just flowing with life force. I mean, I can't even handle it. I got so much.
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:39.000]  Well, I'm not bragging. It's just like, isn't that the essence of passion?
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:43.000]  Well, women just walking me on the street my whole life and just go, man, I'm not bragging.
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:46.000]  They just go, what do I feel? It's called life.
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000]  And these guys don't have it.
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:57.000]  It's what they could have is a real passion system if they actually found reality and found life and found the love of humanity.
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:04.000]  Instead, they choose to side with the opposite of that, which is a vampiric style of evil in which they have to siphon energy to exist.
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:10.000]  And it's this spirit we're fighting, whether it's in gangs, thugs, the police, whoever, it's a spirit. It's good versus evil.
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000]  It's not black or white. It's good versus evil.
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:17.000]  And it felt good to be out there opposing those guys because we weren't really so much anticipating that.
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:23.000]  I didn't know how many people were going to show up because right before I went to Cleveland, it was raining pretty hard all throughout the weeks leading up to that.
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:28.000]  I just said, I remember I said, I got a feeling we're pulling trigger next Thursday. Rain or no rain, we're going out there.
[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:29.000]  I said about 100 people show up.
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:32.000]  And no rain, you know, and everybody came out there and it was a great time.
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:37.000]  We're going to come back and play some of these clips where this woman says she kills her babies.
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:41.000]  And this is while David Knight's wife is trying to just talk to her sweetly.
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000]  And it's just the hate of these women.
[01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:47.000]  And you get around the feminist and these people, this is who they are.
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:57.000]  To a woman, they are lovers of death, clothed in black, like the black drapes that they don't even have the honor to put over the dead bodies of the chopped up children.
[01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:35.000]  Are you tired of being cyber raped by big government and big business?

[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:33.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show. I'm Alex Jones, Anthony Goodjiardian, Karri Jackson, and we're both at the pro-life Black Lives Matter event.
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:41.000]  Just trying to get other people around the country to hijack the George Soros anti-police stuff. Again, not that we're for some of the police problems.
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:49.000]  You're not going to reform it, funneling energy and media coverage in to empower community organizers from the Marxist left, and that's who they are.
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:55:03.000]  By the way, these vampires aren't exceptions and the nastiest of the nasty. They are the nastiest of the nasty, but the nastiest of the nasty is the common denominator when you go out to these events.
[01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:14.000]  They look the same, act the same, whether it's New York City, whether it's Denver, Colorado, whether it's Austin, Texas. They always say, I love killing babies, I love Satan.
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:23.000]  I haven't gotten to the I Love Satan clips yet. We'll try to cue those up. I've got so many clips, but here is the lady talking about how she kills her babies. Here it is.
[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:35.000]  Here's her boyfriend bragging about 50 babies. I get free abortions on demand without apology. And I'm going to hell. Yeah, I still pay to kill babies though.
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:48.000]  Really? Oh yeah. How do you get your abortions paid for? I pay for them. I thought you said three. Upwards to 50. Really? Oh yeah. Wow, you must make money from the community for it.
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:57.000]  Oh, you don't use your money? You multiply your efforts, huh? Why are you so worried about a fucking zygote? And ultimately your sympathies do not lie with black people.
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:05.000]  They lie with your racist white middle class agenda, and that's where we'll always lie, and you will be destroyed holding that line. Okay, I adopted Choo Choo.
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:14.000]  Oh, good for you, white savior. Aren't you so proud you're fucking white? Exactly, he's not white. Exactly, you're a white savior.
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:27.000]  You think that it is the white man's duty to fix everybody's problems, right? How many did I adopt? I kill my kids. How many did I adopt? I kill my kids.
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:31.000]  I kill my kids.
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:44.000]  We're not really editing that because right after that, the other one jumps in. Is it in the longer clip towards the end where they deny that they're communists and then we show their faces from Facebook? Yeah, that's right.
[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:53.000]  And then the other one says, look at my big, such and such, we can't play it on air. Look at my underarm air. Oh, I'm a feminist and I love Satan. Do we have that?
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:57:03.000]  Yeah, we'll have to script to it, but it's sending to that line. Well, as soon as you find the I Love Satan goblin, the goblin creature, we'll go to that. Anthony Jacari watching that.
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:08.000]  I mean, we've got a bunch more of this we haven't gotten to. Do they realize how evil they look?
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:24.000]  I don't know if they realize exactly how they portray themselves, but it reminds me of this article that Kit has out right now. Communist call for red terror murder campaign to exterminate America's middle class because as you saw in the clip when she was talking to David Knight's wife, it's you racist white middle class person.
[01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:33.000]  She doesn't know her from anybody else, but she just comes out with this rhetoric that rolled off her tongue quite easily, which makes me think it's a talking point that she says it's somewhat regular.
[01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:46.000]  That's the classic feminist thing they teach everyone at UT and every other university. That's what they teach. Yeah, exactly. And you could tell that by what's a power trip. I mean, here's some middle aged white lady who went and saved a girl out of a starving and orphanage.
[01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:55.000]  You know, she was literally like, you know, malnourished. They kill a lot of them in those orphanages. They went and saved her. She actually did something humanitarian.
[01:57:55.000 --> 01:58:07.000]  She's a great educated, sweet 13 year old who was out there. She doesn't have to do anything. She just has the moral high ground over her elder says you're scum. I'm somebody. You didn't go adopt somebody because you love children.
[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:13.000]  You did it because you're bad. You did it because you're white. Oh yeah. They believe that's sick.
[01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:29.000]  Should have just killed your babies. That's moral, Jacari. How dare you save a Chinese girl. How dare you kill your babies. It's liberal. Shut down people's signs. Take away everything and hail Satan.
[01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:40.000]  It's liberal. Just let us have your guns. They say though, just turn those guns in. We're going to take a real good care of you. That's what they say. They want our guns. They're going to have their way with us. They are vampires.
[01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:48.000]  Thank you for listening. We'll be back. They want to put us in reeducation camp. We're going to play that clip coming up. More with Jacari Jackson and Anthony Gaciardi.

[01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:24.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:45.000]  And you're not Stalin supporters? No, I'm not. I'm a f***ing anarchist, sir. Hold on, so there's not a Facebook with you saying you love Stalin?
[02:00:45.000 --> 02:01:02.000]  Go away! How many did I adopt? I kill my kids. Ultimately, your sympathies do not lie with black people. They lie with your racist white middle class agenda and that's where we'll always lie and you will be destroyed holding that line.
[02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:17.000]  You own that label. You are a misogynist. You are a misogynist. Look at my picture. Wait a minute, you marching a black lives matter thing with a hammer and circle? Is that you?
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:35.000]  Are you just asking? Are you hearing that? Are you talking to us? We have the footage. I've been raising it with a red TV right now. That is impressive. That's really impressive. Hey man, you're a people. I've never met an alien before. What's it like? Which planet? What do they sound like?
[02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:52.000]  That's a pretty serious one. Yeah, it is. Anyways, do you have any language skills other than cuss words? Cuss words? Cuss words? More pathetic than gollum. More pathetic than gollum. More than rings? Yeah.
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:02:06.000]  You don't want to talk? Not to you. You just want to block everybody else's microphones? I don't want to talk to you. Why the f*** would I want to talk to you? You sure came out here and you sure made fools of yourself, so thank you.
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:23.000]  I think it's interesting about this, Alex, and I've encountered this a lot. When I go out to these demonstrations, I meet people who are anti, you know, whatever the cause may be. They have to come up with just something ridiculous. Like you heard the girl in the clip saying, what's it like to meet an alien? I was like, I've never claimed to meet an alien or Bigfoot or all these other things that they concoct in their minds to try to destroy our argument.
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:34.000]  She didn't understand that Alex had been speaking with the producer at an earpiece saying, what's that producers? What's going on? And she's like, who are you speaking to aliens? And what's so interesting is, you notice none of those...
[02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:43.000]  Because they don't know how anything works. There's no substance in it. There's no actual substance in what they're saying to you. They're just cursing at you and cursing at you and telling them they love Satan and they want to kill babies.
[02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:53.000]  And they're like, we're going to win. We're going to destroy the white middle class. Oh, okay. Those guys, yeah, it's the real A-team out there. I hope they put those guys out there.
[02:02:53.000 --> 02:03:05.000]  I'll tell you what's scary. A lot of them will end up running federal departments and stuff. You watch. That's those people. In fact, we have the Larry Graf walled clip where he's in with the weathermen that trained Obama and they're talking about putting us in reeducation camps.
[02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:19.000]  I mean, they actually have North Korean and Maoist propaganda running around with posters. I mean, we can laugh at it and I know it's funny at a sick level, but they were on their phones going, we're not allowed to leave yet.
[02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:26.000]  Okay. Is that what he says? And we've tracked them back to this UT professor that does have money behind him and his sorrows connected. So this is their jobs.
[02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:31.000]  There was a guy driving around in a Jaguar, waving money out the door to them.
[02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000]  An $80,000 one.
[02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:41.000]  Yeah. Waving money out, which we speculate, it makes the most sense that he's saying, hey, whoever causes the most trouble, you know, get some cash.
[02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:50.000]  And not to mention, I've been downtown having some dinner one time when they had, they took over. It's so funny. They accused us of taking over Black Lives Matter. They infiltrated the Black Lives Matter.
[02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:58.000]  And led it downtown and put communist propaganda in it. Basically saying, kill all cops, kill pigs. And here the cops are. This was the most ridiculous part.
[02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:04.000]  They were being nicer to them because they were driving on their bicycles behind them saying, it's okay, guys. No big deal. It's not causing any issues.
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:12.000]  No, I kill cops, kill cops, pigs, cops. They're like, well, they're like, well, hey, guys, you know, let's, let's make sure they blocked off all the roads for them.
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:18.000]  They blocked off all the roads. We saw it went out there. Yeah. And the cops are super nice. Kill all the cops, kill the pigs.
[02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:22.000]  And yeah, you're going to destroy the white, white class Americans, right?
[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:30.000]  Sure. With your amazing ideology of Mao who killed 84 million. And they have tattoos of Stalin and and final comment.
[02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:38.000]  Final comment, Jakari. Great job, Anthony. Final comment. I'm just happy everybody came out today and came out yesterday and we saw the true colors of those communists.
[02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:41.000]  Everybody loves it when you jump in front of me when he's, I'm about to fight that guy.
[02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:47.000]  They even mess with old men and young ladies. I just, I couldn't take it anymore. I was like, you guys want to fight and let's fight.
[02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:53.000]  What were you going to do if he hit you again? I would have did what I had to do. You know, I didn't provoke the guy. I said, you need to stop what you're doing.
[02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:58.000]  If you take a swing with it, it's going to end there. And he decided not to do that. Well, I wish he would have.
[02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:10.000]  In case you missed it yesterday, the hashtag Black Lives Matter protest was interrupted by members of Red Guards Austin, a political organization that admits they are a Marxist, Leninist, Maoist collective.
[02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:22.000]  These guardians of the people attempted to block other people's free speech, yelled at them, and then even started to agitate by bumping into people, pushing people around and even stealing and breaking some of our broadcast equipment.
[02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:32.000]  Luckily, it was all caught on camera and we were able to explain to the cops what happened. If you go to the Red Guards Austin Facebook page, you can see pictures of some of these individuals who showed up yesterday.
[02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:44.000]  During the live broadcast, we were able to show Facebook images of these individuals carrying communist sickles, burning American flags, and basically trying to get everybody into a race war against the police.
[02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:52.000]  Of course, they were there dressed in all black, saying, we're here for women's health. But then even on tape, they talked about how they loved to kill babies.
[02:05:52.000 --> 02:06:19.000]  Check out our YouTube videos on the Alex Jones channel and the articles on Infowars.com. Rob Dew reporting for Infowars.com.

[02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:19.000]  A frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:25.000]  That's right. You've got to get attention in this world. You've got to snap people out of their trance.
[02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:35.000]  And so I am launching and have been launching a frontal assault on the globalist in the Infowar to draw them out, to show people who they are.
[02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:46.000]  And if that means them destroying me, so be it. I don't want that. But if that's in God's plan, I do. I'm committed.
[02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:54.000]  Like a kamikaze coming in. And I'll tell you this, it feels good to be on the right side.
[02:08:54.000 --> 02:09:03.000]  We've got the globalist in a stranglehold. And we've got to realize we have the power.
[02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:09.000]  We're not going to be held back by the New World Order. This is our greatest test we're now facing.
[02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:17.000]  There is so much to cover. Net neutrality faces First Amendment challenges because it's not really net neutrality.
[02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:26.000]  World's oldest person dies in 116. I'm reading Drudge Report headlines. A lot of these are up on Infowars as well.
[02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:34.000]  Magazine saying it could be the demise of the Democratic Party because they're pushing the stagnant Hillary. Hillary forgets where she is in public.
[02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:44.000]  But the really big bad news, the disgusting news, Orrin Hatch on trade bill, I don't know fully what's in the TPP myself.
[02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:52.000]  There's actually a video of that. It's on Breitbart. Drudge Report has it linked. DrudgeReport.com.
[02:09:52.000 --> 02:10:02.000]  Senator Elizabeth Warren went to the Senate floor to push for immediate consideration of a bill that would make the Obama trade text public.
[02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:08.000]  You've got a coalition of liberals and Tea Party fighting together against the establishment Republicans and Democrats.
[02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:20.000]  Right now Congress has to go to a secured room to read the text, thousands of pages, and take notes or to discuss what is in it with the public.
[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:26.000]  The motion failed when Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican in Utah, objected since it required unanimous consent.
[02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:40.000]  Then they go on with the quote here with Orrin Hatch and others basically whitewashing it and Orrin Hatch saying he doesn't know what's in it himself.
[02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:45.000]  Well, it's 30 plus points, only one of which is leaked and it's incredibly draconian to free speech.
[02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:58.000]  At the end of Internet Freedom as we know it, it's a consortium of private corporations and lobbyists with government representatives from China, you name it, on the board with voting power to veto the United States,
[02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:11.000]  and Congress isn't reading it, isn't letting it come out and is turning it over. This is world government. This is corporate world government tyranny in your face.
[02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:23.000]  This is what we're dealing with. Now I mentioned the really good news, if you just joined us, the official al-Qaeda slash ISIS magazine and videos have come out attacking info wars dot com.
[02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:36.000]  And they're saying that they're sick of the conspiracy theorist claiming that Western intelligence is funding their jihad operation, that they're having trouble getting recruits out of the UK, Europe and the United States and Canada.
[02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:48.000]  Again, I've explained how this works. They've had the controlled opposition come out and say that Jones is being CIA again claiming that ISIS is real. It's all fake.
[02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:56.000]  So they have that fake attack and they got the other attack saying no, no, no, it is 100% real, not partially fake like Alex says.
[02:11:56.000 --> 02:12:08.000]  What's really going on is this is a large synthetic terror group funded with over $5 billion by the United States alone, several billion from NATO, the French and others, Turkey, you name it, big coalition,
[02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:16.000]  officially sending in jihadis trained in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and other areas with backups from the West to go in as basically mercenaries.
[02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:26.000]  They've taken two thirds of Syria or close to it. They've taken part of Iraq. They're going to create a new Islamic state out of it. That's run by Saudi Arabia. That was always the plan to break Iraq in three parts.
[02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:34.000]  Just Google Pentagon plans to break Iraq in three parts. That was out 15 years ago. That's Wesley Clark talked about it. Okay.
[02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:40.000]  I just happened to know what's going on. This is not rocket science. And there's my video from last week.
[02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:50.000]  The ISIS Ramadi victory and the breakup of Iraq order out of chaos through Sunni Shia conflict. Kurt Nemo wrote about it.
[02:12:50.000 --> 02:13:01.000]  I guess he's written a new article about it, but there's the video where I covered it last week going over it all and they're hopping mad that I sit there with a map and just explain to everybody.
[02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:11.000]  In fact, if they're so mad, can you guys bring me a hands free microphone for later? Once it gets in here, I'm going to go over to the map over there of the Middle East and I'm going to explain this even better for people
[02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:21.000]  because it needs to be done for all the young Muslims out there. They want to radicalize Muslims so they can have a class of civilizations and destroy your culture and destroy good Muslims.
[02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:33.000]  And that's why the globalists are funding both sides to collide and you know that's a fact. And the real sin is killing Christians and non radical Muslims and not being tolerant.
[02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:43.000]  And the real sin is working for the satanic Saudi Arabian government and going around and persecuting people. Repent now. Repent now.
[02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:53.000]  I'll guarantee you your souls in jeopardy. If you're a Muslim Christian, whatever, if you do these type of atrocities and if you don't repent of it, it's never too late.
[02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:59.000]  But you need to repent of what you've done and you need to leave ISIS, leave al-Qaeda and stop it right now.
[02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:07.000]  I want to warn you though, they'll grab you on the way back because you're not real al-Qaeda if you haven't participated in stuff yet because they know you may speak out.
[02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:19.000]  So you may never be able to go home again. So you really got set up. You were part of something really sick and your best bet is just to get out of al-Qaeda or ISIS and go back and shut your mouth.
[02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:29.000]  They may leave you alone. So yes, we are in FullWars.com and our listeners are the main contributors in helping break up ISIS. That's right.
[02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:41.000]  Our government could take them out anytime they wanted to. They're waiting till it gets out of control. Then they're going to send them in and push them back into western Iraq, into that area of Syria.
[02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:45.000]  That's been the plan. I said it last year. I said it four years ago. It's always been the plan.
[02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:56.000]  But again, we're decompartmentalizing where their own operatives cannot defeat us because we're telling their people what's going to happen before it happens.
[02:14:56.000 --> 02:15:12.000]  You can't beat the fact that we have your game plan. And again, I'm on a power trip, but I've realized we need to let the listeners understand how epic this time is and how powerful you are and how powerful truth is.
[02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:34.000]  Now, Leigh Ann McAdoo joins us right through the rest of the hour. Before we go to Paul Watson, your take on the free speech attacks yesterday, recap where we were, what we were doing for new listeners at the pro-life rally.
[02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:44.000]  You were here watching it live. You helped discover, along with CJ, their Facebook, that they were communists, that I'd already covered them before and didn't know it.
[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:58.000]  And then they would deny live on TV and radio when we had their pictures up and videos up that they were communist or Maoist. And then the I Love Satan, I Love Killing My Children, and they had devil tats and all of it.
[02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:10.000]  What would you call these people? A scum of the earth under the rock dwellers, psychic vampires, the biggest losers in the galaxy.
[02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:22.000]  Really sad and confused. I mean, here we have the one girl who seemed to be sort of the leader yelling at Karen, calling her white savior and stuff and you know how...
[02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:34.000]  Well, the leader was a little blonde and she's a Time Warner operative over there. I guess over there working at Time Warner. We're going to investigate that and talk to Time Warner. I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:46.000]  Well, I mean, obviously confused because she has tattoos on her arms of two racist white people who are, she like bows down to them.
[02:16:46.000 --> 02:17:00.000]  Hello, Stalin, Lenin, what are they? You know what I mean? Like, how confused do you have to be to say how against you are of the, you want to take down the white race and then you get them tatted on your body and you, I don't know.
[02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:04.000]  It's totally sick. I mean, what did you make of her saying I killed my babies?
[02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:23.000]  Well, I got to tell you, I couldn't sleep last night. I was up really late last night because that just, I can't believe that there are people like that, they're real people who are organizing a lot of young people and who are mobilizing young people in Austin and other cities around the country.
[02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000]  That's who leaves them all over. I'm telling you.
[02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:40.000]  It's frightening. It's so frightening. And I was like, I mean, it really shook up. I could not fall asleep last night. I just get replaying that over and over in my head about how they'd, they say, excuse me, pardon me, as they're barreling through you, or they would shove and push.
[02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:50.000]  And then as soon as someone shoved and pushed them, they're like, Oh, calm down. Calm down. Oh, you know, you're assaulting me. I'm going to sue. Yeah. And like everything and be like, Oh, hello, officers. We like you so much.
[02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:59.000]  We want their website kill pigs. Right. And it's the opposite. Rotten pig heads. And it's the opposite of the truth. Everything they say is complete opposite. That's what communists are like.
[02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:12.000]  Leigh Ann, here's what's scary. I've been doing this 20 years. Well, 25 as an activist. That's normal. I mean, to think they all get PhDs and go on to run things. Yeah, it's they look the same. They act the same.
[02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:19.000]  Each generation I've had to come over and grab and go, we're going to kill you someday, Jones. When the commies take over, we're going to get your children. I mean, that's who they are.
[02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:29.000]  And they're they're very patient and they'll wait decades to implement this plan. I mean, how many more smart psychopaths don't just go grab kids off the street. They go and they become the government.
[02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:38.000]  And they plot and they plot and they say, everyone just calm down and wait, we'll let you know when we're ready to attack. So that's the thing is that they plot this and they'll wait years, decades.
[02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:53.000]  I mean, you see these these policies, like you said, Obama graduated out of that. And now here he's the president of the United States decades later. You know, absolutely, we're going to break watches with us the rest of the hour doing a great job over at info wars.com.
[02:18:53.000 --> 02:19:01.000]  Paul, you watched this from afar, but giving us your take from London. What really stands out for you?
[02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:16.000]  Well, it's just the irony in the hypocrisy of it, Alex. I mean, we've got them on video calling themselves anarchists. They call themselves anarchists while embracing the most violent form of statism in recorded history.
[02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:36.000]  The cultural Maoist Revolution, the Great Leap Forward, which killed at least 60 million people. Okay, state imposed genocide, and they call themselves anarchists. And in fact, their own name, Red God, the Red Gods comes from what Mao called for to enact that violent brutal
[02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:52.000]  revolution. So that's derived directly from what Mao called for back in the 60s. And it's also, again, the hypocrisy of, you know, protesting against state murder. Black Lives Matter against police brutality.
[02:19:52.000 --> 02:20:07.000]  If you're calling for state murder, always a genius Watson going to come back and break it down.

[02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:48.000]  They want to stun and dumb down, and energy drinks and stuff, just cover that up for a while, but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source.
[02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:57.000]  So it's pretty exciting, and I love it. Visit infowarsalife.com today to secure your Super Male Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.

[02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:09.000]  It's true. Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply. It's a disinfectant called chloramine.

[02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:20.000]  According to these people, we've been talking about they need to be fed on a garbage disposal. Not empowered. It's just the anti-human attitude.
[02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:27.000]  And these people have been running the country and the world the last 60, 70 years, and look how hellish it is, and now humanity's falling apart.
[02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:44.000]  No value on people creates a hellish world. Not a good one. We've got breaking news. They've got a group of U.S. military veterans, a group of veterans building army, raising funds to put down the rabid dog of ISIS.
[02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:57.000]  Let me tell these guys this. It was the U.S. military a few years ago that said no to openly backing al-Qaeda, so the government changed the name to ISIS to confuse you and is actually funding them.
[02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:06.000]  The way to beat this is info war, explaining that ISIS is funded and run by Western intelligence and trained openly in bases in Turkey.
[02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:16.000]  And now even al-Qaeda is coming out and attacking info wars. I say al-Qaeda. They call them those ISIS and saying, don't listen. We are not part of the West.
[02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:26.000]  We're not Western funded. And Steve Watson did a story. It's great. We could do another story adding even more admissions to, hey, directly to ISIS, a message to ISIS fighters.
[02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:35.000]  Here's how you've been conned. Here's the whole history. Don't be part of this. Leave now. And we could have ISIS basically shut down and collapse.
[02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:43.000]  The military won't be sent in until they've already established their state, part of Syria and part of Iraq, breaking Iraq in three parts.
[02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:57.000]  That's always been the plan. Kurd, Shiite, Wahhabist, three parts. That's the plan with the third part extending into Syria and then breaking the rest of Syria up into other groups.
[02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:06.000]  Basically, Western run on the coastline to get the pipelines, to get the oil and gas. Paul Watson, I want to get back into the vampires and finish up with them.
[02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:17.000]  But first, pretty big news to have al-Qaeda putting us in their videos, ISIS putting us in their videos and coming out directly and saying, don't listen to the conspiracy theorists to their own recruits and admitting it's hurting them.
[02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:31.000]  I mean, that is exciting. It shows the truth trumps everything, Paul Watson. Is it starting to get just too much, though, to even believe how Info Wars is changing the world on a daily basis?
[02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:41.000]  Well, I mean, we're definitely steering the narrative. And I think, given the news that it's, quote, conspiracy theorists were making all these militants flee from ISIS.
[02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:59.000]  You know, I think we're old apologies by the mainstream media and by the White House because it was their directives as far back as 2008 in the Bosch administration, which said that, quote, conspiracy theories were a recruiting ground for terrorists in the Middle East.
[02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:07.000]  And now it's actually worked out the opposite way while they're getting all these, you know, mysterious airdrops of weapons from the U.S.
[02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:11.000]  that were the ones that are convincing them to leave by pointing out.
[02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:15.000]  That's right. The Iraqi president has documented the airdrops to him.
[02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:27.000]  Exactly. And, you know, Bell Hatch, the guy in Libya who is leading ISIS forces in Libya, he was armed and funded by NATO, by the U.K., by the U.S.
[02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:41.000]  in the first place when we went in and took out Gaddafi. So the fact that they're waking up to this and realizing that the goal of ousting Assad, which was their goal for years is now being achieved to a large extent by ISIS.
[02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000]  They control half of Syria now.
[02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:57.000]  But really, what does it benefit the U.S. military industrial complex to fight ISIS? So, again, we're owed apologies by all these people who claim that we were the terrorist recruiting ground for ISIS.
[02:27:57.000 --> 02:28:04.000]  Absolutely. Getting back to the vampires, you're making a great point. They claim they're anarchists, but then they got linen and Stalin all over them.
[02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:10.000]  They love Mao, the ultimate total status to live like kings while killing tens of millions of peas.
[02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:17.000]  And then you expand on that, I mean, just the idiocy of it, and then creamily saying, I kill my children, I love Satan.
[02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:27.000]  How would you describe these people, just the most spoiled, rotten, little maggot punks disconnected from reality? I mean, how would you describe these rats?
[02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:34.000]  I think you really don't need to throw many pejoratives at them. They discredit themselves with their own behavior.
[02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:45.000]  They have the debating skills of six-year-old children on the playground who can only hurl insults because, you know, they've got no debating skills whatsoever.
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:53.000]  Their ideas are so cliched and shallow that only, you know, arrested development infantilized man babies could ever adopt them.
[02:28:53.000 --> 02:29:01.000]  And that's why they were there at the protest yesterday, refusing to debate, refusing to talk because they can't defend their own opinions.
[02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:06.000]  Well, they're all mad at their middle-class or rich parents, and they're rebelling to freak them out.
[02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:09.000]  And they're all freaking out here in this right now, not knowing how we know this.
[02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:19.000]  I mean, come on, you guys are a joke. You're the same everywhere. A lot of them are little trust fund kids, and they're there on their, you know, parents paying for their education, bitching about the country.
[02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:30.000]  I mean, there's just, I don't normally use words like rat and scum. I'll just say what people said and say they're tyrants and the enemy, but these people are a spiritual type.
[02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:38.000]  And they love death, and I think God will probably give them what they want sooner rather than later.
[02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:42.000]  Paul, stay there. Leigh Ann, stay there. We've got Duke coming in as well to add to the discussion.
[02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:47.000]  I'm Alex Jones. This is the Info War.
[02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:55.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:23.000]  We're uploading those intimate conversations online in an attempt to discredit that nothing to hide narrative.
[02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:34.000]  The group's website says citizens don't seem to mind this monitoring, so we're hiding recorders in public places in hopes of gathering information to help win the war on terror.
[02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:43.000]  The site encourages those who are angry about surveillance to contact Congress as section 215 of the Patriot Act reaches expiration on June 1.
[02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:47.000]  You can listen to some of those audio recordings embedded in the article.
[02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:53.000]  Activists place hidden tape recorders throughout New York to protest NSA at infowars.com.
[02:30:53.000 --> 02:31:17.000]  This is Leigh Ann McAdoo reporting for infowars.com.
[02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:29.000]  We're now at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:58.000]  That's infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000]  Hey, how are you doing? Good, brother.
[02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:08.000]  I just recently started using your products. Everything you said about them is correct. Me and my wife both use a lot of them and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:13.000]  Well, thank you, brother, it's because it also funds our operation, but doing that I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:21.000]  Supermail vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:26.000]  We've been to the supermail and the superfemale vitality, big changes, a lot of energy.
[02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:30.000]  We've gotten off to the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, a big ton of money there.
[02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:38.000]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated, or maximum potency.
[02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:44.000]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff, just cover that up for a while, but then burn you out in my experience,
[02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:50.000]  whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source, so it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:57.000]  Visit infowarslife.com today to secure your supermail vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000]  Alex Jones.
[02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:31.000]  I'll just keep her coming.
[02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000]  Gonna take you down.
[02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.000]  Down, down, down.
[02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000]  So don't you fool around.
[02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000]  Come on.
[02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000]  Pull the trigger.
[02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:57.000]  We're here live. I think we played this liner twice today, but that's okay.
[02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.000]  Twice is awesome.
[02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:03.000]  Twice is awesome.
[02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000]  But a fire it will.
[02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000]  You're riding around in my car, huh?
[02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:13.000]  The band I've seen the most of all the bands I've ever seen.
[02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:18.000]  I've seen them many times. I've taken four exchange students to see ACDC.
[02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:25.000]  Here's the deal. I love God. I'm not perfect. I know Rock and Roll's got its rebellious tendencies, but the point is,
[02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:31.000]  all these fake Christians sit around and go, he has Rock and Roll music, but I don't see them out trying to save babies' lives in an abortion clinic,
[02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:35.000]  or trying to get fluoride out of the water, or trying to actually expose the devil worshipers.
[02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:39.000]  You know, humans are wild. We're aggressive. Look at King David. Look at Solomon.
[02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:44.000]  They weren't perfect, but they love God. Their heart was right. Yes, they were worldly.
[02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:49.000]  And I'll say it all day. I'm not up on some high horse. I'm not attacking people that have had abortions.
[02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:52.000]  If they're not saying, I'm glad I killed my baby. I love death.
[02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.000]  That's the big difference here.
[02:34:54.000 --> 02:35:01.000]  And I want to get back into that with Paul Watson and Rob Duce here to get into the overall tyranny of the so-called left on universities.
[02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:02.000]  The trading ground.
[02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:06.000]  For the end of free speech. That's what political correctness is.
[02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:09.000]  It's where they can be racist. They can be hateful. They can do whatever.
[02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:14.000]  But you don't have any speech, period. All speech is labeled bad, and they're the authority.
[02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:19.000]  They're the arrogant little authorities because they've been knighted by the professors that live in their own bubble.
[02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:24.000]  You know, spewing all this garbage. You pay 100 grand for your kids to get a UT education or whatever school it is.
[02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:27.000]  And if it's not an engineering or whatever, it's basically like toilet paper.
[02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:32.000]  All you learn how to do, you know, is how to hate men.
[02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:36.000]  And the average man's just dumbed down, stumbling around, not having any idea what's going on.
[02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000]  Because the leadership's been taken out.
[02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:43.000]  How can little info wars be in international news every day, be changing debates,
[02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:49.000]  have major governments admitting they listened to it, have ISIS recruiting, plunging,
[02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:53.000]  doing what the U.S. military isn't allowed to do, because we know the truth.
[02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:57.000]  The truth will set you free. The truth has power.
[02:35:57.000 --> 02:36:01.000]  Everybody should be looking at what we do and going, why is it so effective?
[02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:04.000]  Because it's true. It's true.
[02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:10.000]  I mean, I'm watching the feed live yesterday when David knighted on the night.
[02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:14.000]  And the instant I saw him, I went, oh my gosh, they're going to say they're anarchists.
[02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.000]  They're really communist, but they'll be Satanists. In fact, I said it on air.
[02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:20.000]  I said, in my opinion, we go down there, it's them.
[02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:25.000]  I see that look, I see those, I mean, I saw him from like 50 yards away on the camera.
[02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:27.000]  The camera was like 50 yards away.
[02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:35.000]  And I instantly, the bearing, the spirit, the nastiness, the evil.
[02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:40.000]  Rob do, I want to get your take on all of this, watching it, seeing it.
[02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:44.000]  What was it like here as the info wars, Mountain News, news director watching it?
[02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:47.000]  Well, I was out there shooting from across the road and immediately you were there.
[02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:50.000]  They popped up and I'm like, I'm zeroing in on these guys.
[02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:55.000]  They're going to cause trouble because I've seen this type of behavior before with these types of people.
[02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:57.000]  How could you tell them?
[02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000]  One, it was the clothes and the way they were dressed.
[02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.000]  But then, you know, they weren't really organized.
[02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:06.000]  They were kind of bumbling around and then like the, it was so pathetic watching them try to block the signs.
[02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:09.000]  And they're just trying to throw them up in the air and block them.
[02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:11.000]  And people had bigger signs that were holding them up.
[02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:12.000]  And I just thought it was amazing.
[02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:13.000]  It was the weakness.
[02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.000]  Right. And you could feel the weakness.
[02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:19.000]  All of our protestors, the people that came in for the Black Lives Matter protest,
[02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:20.000]  didn't say anything to them.
[02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:21.000]  They were being respectful.
[02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.000]  They're like, I'm just going to put my sign in front of yours.
[02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000]  And they would get in front of them and like, well, I'll just move my sign in front of yours.
[02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:26.000]  And then they start bumping them.
[02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:30.000]  Then they started like throwing the tar paper on them as they were trying to like walk away.
[02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:32.000]  Like, I'm going to go walk in front of you.
[02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:34.000]  And it was just going.
[02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000]  And then we go, Jakari goes and asks the guy a question.
[02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:37.000]  He goes, don't be aggressive.
[02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000]  I mean, that is just, that is baby.
[02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.000]  Like, I can't think of anything more baby to say.
[02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:42.000]  Somebody asks you a question.
[02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:43.000]  You go, don't be aggressive.
[02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:46.000]  I thought that guy hit me again and then just said, don't be aggressive when I broke his jaw.
[02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:47.000]  Yeah.
[02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:48.000]  Don't be aggressive.
[02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:50.000]  Well, as soon as he walked away, he was like attacking the guy with the sign.
[02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:52.000]  Well, and I got the shot from behind.
[02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:54.000]  When I saw him on Lincoln arms, I knew they were going to do something.
[02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:57.000]  I was, I didn't think they were going to try to run over a crowd of people,
[02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000]  which I think was the dumbest move.
[02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:00.000]  Including like eight year old kids.
[02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:04.000]  Well, and the first guy that hits this old guy and he's just standing there and they just run over him.
[02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:09.000]  And then they go after you guys and they ran into Weldon Henson, who's just, you know, he's a good old boy.
[02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.000]  And he's like, I'm not moving.
[02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.000]  You don't have to go around.
[02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:16.000]  And I mean, that was just great to see that.
[02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:17.000]  I liked how he started hitting him.
[02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:18.000]  So he just started choking two of them.
[02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:20.000]  He just grabbed two of them by the throat, sort of choking them to the ground.
[02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:22.000]  Feels like you better calm down.
[02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:23.000]  Exactly.
[02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:24.000]  And that's how you have to be.
[02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:25.000]  And you're right.
[02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:26.000]  These, those people are bullies.
[02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:29.000]  And they want to walk around and get in your face and say stuff.
[02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:31.000]  And then if you say one thing, don't be aggressive.
[02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:32.000]  It's just so help me.
[02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:33.000]  I don't.
[02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:34.000]  Exactly.
[02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:35.000]  And then they're like, oh, don't.
[02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:36.000]  I told you that.
[02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:40.000]  But that, that the breeding ground is the universe.
[02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:44.000]  The breeding ground is the universities because they teach you about free speech zones and
[02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:49.000]  they teach you how to not say the wrong thing because it may offend somebody.
[02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:50.000]  Because they're the boss.
[02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:51.000]  It's all about they control.
[02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:52.000]  Oh, I'm liberal.
[02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000]  Say what I say or I'll denounce you.
[02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:55.000]  Denounce me all day as a heretic.
[02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:56.000]  I'm sick of you.
[02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.000]  And, and having to get your signs approved and what you're doing.
[02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:00.000]  And I just went back and just did a few searches.
[02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:04.000]  One which really stood out was the young Americans for freedom that were passing out constitutions
[02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:06.000]  back in 2014.
[02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:07.000]  And they were stopped.
[02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:08.000]  They were told you can't pass.
[02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:09.000]  It was banned.
[02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:12.000]  And then there's other students that were just trying to pass out.
[02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:13.000]  It was pro-gun signs.
[02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:14.000]  The anti-Obama sign.
[02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:15.000]  Then you had another.
[02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:16.000]  That was just this week.
[02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:17.000]  That was this week.
[02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:22.000]  And then also in George Washington University, they, they told the students there at actually
[02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:26.000]  a Dixie state that they couldn't have signs lampooning Bush and Obama.
[02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:27.000]  It's like you can't do any.
[02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:30.000]  Of course the university used to be about the place where anybody could do anything.
[02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:31.000]  Any time of you were a student.
[02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:32.000]  Exactly.
[02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:35.000]  And then all you can learn about is white privilege and white guilt.
[02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:38.000]  And do you remember back in 2011, you have my brother here.
[02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:40.000]  He was doing the paper on Ron Paul and how the media was ignoring him.
[02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:42.000]  And he already had his degree in statistics.
[02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:43.000]  He was going to do another one.
[02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.000]  Are we allowed to talk about it?
[02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000]  They threatened his masters.
[02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:48.000]  Right.
[02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:49.000]  When he did work for us.
[02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:50.000]  Right.
[02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:51.000]  Exactly.
[02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:52.000]  And they didn't like the fact that he was talking about Ron Paul.
[02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:53.000]  The professor.
[02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:54.000]  They told him.
[02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:55.000]  This is something you shouldn't be covering.
[02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:56.000]  You shouldn't be doing this.
[02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:57.000]  This is a non-issue.
[02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:58.000]  This is a non-issue.
[02:39:58.000 --> 02:39:59.000]  They just couldn't stand.
[02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:00.000]  They're all about stifling.
[02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:03.000]  It's the opposite of what a university would be in the Renaissance.
[02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:04.000]  Right.
[02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:05.000]  Exactly.
[02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:06.000]  It's like, hey, let's ask more questions.
[02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:07.000]  Why can't we just ask more questions?
[02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:08.000]  That's what it's supposed to be about.
[02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:10.000]  You know, when you take your philosophy.
[02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:13.000]  And in fairness, there are good professors at every university.
[02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:16.000]  But their impact pushed around, demoted, kicked out.
[02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:17.000]  Oh, yeah.
[02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:18.000]  I mean, yeah.
[02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:21.000]  That's the only thing is the parting line.
[02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:25.000]  We ought to have your brother tell that story now that he's out.
[02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:26.000]  Oh, yeah.
[02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:28.000]  He's out and he's doing statistics for a pretty big company now.
[02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.000]  A company I used to work for.
[02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:32.000]  He's doing great.
[02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:33.000]  But he didn't let that stop him.
[02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.000]  He still said, nope, I'm going to publish my paper.
[02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:36.000]  I'm going to do it.
[02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:39.000]  And then he put it out and they got so mad when he came on in for us.
[02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:40.000]  They were so mad.
[02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:42.000]  Because that'd be a victory for them to shut him off.
[02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:43.000]  Oh, yeah, totally.
[02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:46.000]  I know so many executive scientists, you name it, that go,
[02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:47.000]  we'll be attacked if I speak out.
[02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:48.000]  I'm going to shut up.
[02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:51.000]  You're going to lose everything if you don't speak up.
[02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.000]  So what if you lose your job?
[02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:56.000]  If we don't beat these people, we're going to lose everything.
[02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:58.000]  Don't you get it?
[02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:00.000]  There'll be other people who will offer you a job.
[02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:04.000]  By speaking out, you'll, you'll, you'll, and, you know, you'll get other people just to go,
[02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:05.000]  wow, that guy's got balls.
[02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:06.000]  He's got.
[02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:09.000]  He's who we need as a major person in this company.
[02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:10.000]  Exactly.
[02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:11.000]  Let's bring this guy in.
[02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:12.000]  He's not afraid to speak his mind.
[02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:13.000]  So, and that's what we need more of.
[02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:15.000]  And that's what we don't have enough of in this country.
[02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:18.000]  Everybody's like worried about offending somebody and everybody walks around like this.
[02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:23.000]  Well, that's why the cops I later learned today knew those were the kill the cop,
[02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:27.000]  kill the pig people, and they just kissed their butt intimidated by them.
[02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:28.000]  I don't know why.
[02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:32.000]  I mean, why is it if they're totally pathetic, scum, breaking the law,
[02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:38.000]  violating the First Amendment, villains, why does everyone have to bow to the weakest pile of horse crap?
[02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:39.000]  That's a good point.
[02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:43.000]  I mean, I want to understand why as a country we bow to whatever's pathetic.
[02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:50.000]  I think that's a longstanding tradition in our company or our country for the last 30 years.
[02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:54.000]  They've been training people not to speak out, to go with the herd.
[02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:56.000]  And that's what we don't do here.
[02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:57.000]  We don't go with the herd.
[02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:58.000]  That's it.
[02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:00.000]  infowars.com, not with the herd.
[02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:01.000]  There you go.
[02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:02.000]  That's Logan.
[02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:04.000]  And that's basically what we have.
[02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:07.000]  infowars.com. Chuck Norris loves it.
[02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:08.000]  There is one good news.
[02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:12.000]  There's actually a college in the University of Georgia.
[02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:15.000]  They actually stopped their free speech zone.
[02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000]  There was enough outcry from it in this year.
[02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000]  Hey, I was arrested in New York for not being in a free speech zone.
[02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:20.000]  There were thousands of lawsuits.
[02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:21.000]  They don't do that anymore.
[02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:22.000]  No.
[02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:23.000]  Austin used to say free speech zone.
[02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:24.000]  I would say no arrest me.
[02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:25.000]  Well, that's what it is.
[02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:28.000]  The story we just reported on, that's in a blend college.
[02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:29.000]  So that's the good news.
[02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:30.000]  We're saying no, they're failing.
[02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:31.000]  Exactly.
[02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.000]  You say no, and then you file a lawsuit.
[02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000]  That's what you have to do, because otherwise they will...
[02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.000]  You want a lawsuit against the police when they arrested you?
[02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:38.000]  Exactly.
[02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:39.000]  That was a free speech.
[02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:40.000]  That was a big free speech moment.
[02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:44.000]  And we weren't doing anything but standing on a hill covering an anti-police brutality.
[02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:46.000]  And the cops are being given illegal orders.
[02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:48.000]  They should have said no, but we don't hate them.
[02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:49.000]  We're not their enemy.
[02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:50.000]  We want to reform them.
[02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:55.000]  We sued them and won to teach them that you will not violate the First Amendment.
[02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:56.000]  Right.
[02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:57.000]  And that becomes a policy in their department.
[02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:58.000]  Yeah.
[02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:00.000]  They don't know, they're just following orders.
[02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:03.000]  Well, and that goes only so far at some point.
[02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:07.360]  Well, at the same time, there's a difference between not liking MRAPs and checkpoints in
[02:43:07.360 --> 02:43:11.500]  the police state run by the globalist when the very same globalist now want to scapegoat
[02:43:11.500 --> 02:43:13.000]  the cops for everything.
[02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:19.000]  And then you go look from Ferguson to Maryland to everywhere, it's this exact scum, Soros
[02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:22.000]  funded, that is agitating at all.
[02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:25.000]  So I will never join with those people.
[02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:26.000]  No.
[02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:27.000]  They don't have anything.
[02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:30.000]  That's the best interest in mind, but creating this revolution where they think they're going
[02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:31.000]  to have anything.
[02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:32.000]  Those people are pathetic.
[02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:33.000]  They couldn't build a school.
[02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:34.000]  They couldn't build a road.
[02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:35.000]  They couldn't do it.
[02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:36.000]  They would have no planning.
[02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:37.000]  Yeah.
[02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:38.000]  Here's the deal.
[02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:39.000]  Our day survey has been in this office many times.
[02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:40.000]  I want to get him back on.
[02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:41.000]  I think he's a good guy overall.
[02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:42.000]  You know, means well.
[02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:45.000]  He's done some good reforms in the police department.
[02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:46.000]  So there's a lot of problems.
[02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:47.000]  Any big city would.
[02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:51.000]  But overall, I think we have a model police department compared to the wreck that say Albuquerque
[02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:52.000]  is where we're on the radio.
[02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:53.840]  Now, you know, major problems there.
[02:43:53.840 --> 02:43:55.000]  He will fire bad cops.
[02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:56.000]  It does routinely.
[02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:57.000]  But I've seen changes.
[02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.000]  And it wasn't that bad before compared to other cities.
[02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:00.000]  It was pretty good department.
[02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:01.000]  But I think it's kind of bad.
[02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:04.000]  But he said in the hallway here one day, he goes, Hey, don't you say I'm a.
[02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:05.000]  I mean, to poke you that hard.
[02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:06.000]  Sorry.
[02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:08.000]  He goes, Hey, we had to flee Cuba.
[02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:10.000]  You know, my dad fought against, you know, Fidel Castro.
[02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:11.000]  I went and looked it up.
[02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:12.000]  It was actually true involved with the CIA.
[02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:13.000]  You name it.
[02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:15.000]  He goes, you don't sit there and call me a communist.
[02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:17.000]  I go, wait, you're setting up more on those checkpoints.
[02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:19.000]  You're taking blood, which got overturned Supreme Court.
[02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:20.000]  You're doing stuff.
[02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:25.000]  So all I'm saying is being anti-gun going along with your orders from the Democratic City Council
[02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:26.000]  is violate my rights.
[02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:30.000]  And it is mousey tongue type garbage for El Castro garbage.
[02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:33.000]  And he goes, well, listen, just don't say I'm a communist because I'm not.
[02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:34.000]  Well, that's fine.
[02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:35.000]  But here's the deal.
[02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:41.000]  Are they surveyed those punk kids are going to get in a lot of trouble or end up getting
[02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:44.000]  hurt next time they punch somebody or attack somebody.
[02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.000]  And this needs to be investigated.
[02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:51.000]  Them attacking a free speech rally and doing the things they did and on their Facebook
[02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:55.000]  talking about attacking police, which goes over the line of free speech.
[02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:56.000]  Okay.
[02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:59.000]  So if I did that, the police would be here and they should be.
[02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:01.000]  I want something done about them.
[02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:02.000]  I'm sick of this crap.
[02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:04.000]  You, we had sick of it.
[02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:06.000]  I want the APD to do their job right now.
[02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:09.000]  We have people come here saying you were threatening people just because people are posting comments
[02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:12.000]  on your website about, about, with cops.
[02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:15.000]  They're on their website saying, I'm going to go back to Paul Watson saying that I'm
[02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:17.000]  threatening him to come to their, their hovels.
[02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:23.000]  And then they're, they're posting other people's houses that I don't live there.
[02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:28.000]  And fine, go to those houses, go harass these poor guys named Alex Jones.
[02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:33.000]  There's 10 of them, three of them have gotten visits, not since this, but other people.
[02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:35.000]  A lot of visits, crazy fans, you name it.
[02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:39.000]  The truth is, is that I don't even live in a house under my name.
[02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:42.000]  So you morons going to Alex Jones's houses, you're not getting there.
[02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:45.000]  Plus, if you get there, it's a gate, dogs and gun.
[02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:49.000]  Ain't nothing going to happen except, except you might, if you threaten my family,
[02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:51.000]  you're going to be pushing up daisies.
[02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:52.000]  And that's not a threat.
[02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:53.000]  It's a fact.
[02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:55.000]  I've got my rights.
[02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:59.000]  So again, that's the bottom line here is that no, we're not threatening you.
[02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:01.000]  No, we're not coming to your house.
[02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:02.000]  Everything they say is a lie.
[02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:03.000]  We're not communists.
[02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:04.000]  They're communists.
[02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:05.000]  I'm threatening to come to their house and hurt them.
[02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:06.000]  No, I haven't.
[02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:07.000]  And then they do it to us.
[02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:08.000]  It's just sick.
[02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:12.000]  I mean, and do these morons really, this shows what they're so dumb.
[02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:17.000]  You think I'm scared of you when I take on the entire New World Order?
[02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:22.000]  I mean, do you have any idea the people that listen to this show and support it inside the system?
[02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:25.000]  If you did, you'd be scared right now.
[02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:26.000]  Okay.
[02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:27.000]  Not a me.
[02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:29.000]  I don't have to do anything or say anything.
[02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:30.000]  Okay.
[02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:33.000]  You have no idea who you're jacking with, punks.
[02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:34.000]  Excuse me.
[02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:36.000]  I want to bring Paul Watson on.
[02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:41.000]  Paul Watson shifting back into just the war on free speech by the so-called left.
[02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:44.000]  How do we stop calling them the left?
[02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:48.000]  How do we, because they're not liberals like Thomas Jefferson.
[02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:54.000]  They are snake cult, wing of doom, wing of death.
[02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:57.000]  I mean, what do you call people that say, I want to kill my baby.
[02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:59.000]  I love Satan.
[02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:04.000]  Well, they're vicious authoritarians and they don't believe in equality.
[02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:05.000]  This is the core of it.
[02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:07.000]  Leftists don't believe in equality.
[02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:09.000]  It's this oppression Olympics.
[02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:15.000]  They believe in this hierarchy of victimhood where truth is ascertained by degrees of gender
[02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:16.000]  and skin color.
[02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:19.000]  And as you said earlier, it's all coming out of the universities.
[02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:23.000]  What you saw yesterday during that protest isn't happening in a vacuum.
[02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:28.000]  You know, every single week on Twitter, these social justice warriors attacked me.
[02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:33.000]  In fact, I was in Cosmopolitan Time Magazine and Marie Claire for simply making a tweet
[02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:35.000]  about how to spot a feminist.
[02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:39.000]  And then I was bombarded by all these death threats.
[02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:45.000]  They threatened to put me in a gulag in front of a firing squad and execute me with a guillotine
[02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:49.000]  behind me simply for making these tweets about radical feminism.
[02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:52.000]  So do a story on that because I saw those.
[02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:55.000]  Some of these are prominent feminists calling for your murder.
[02:47:55.000 --> 02:48:00.000]  Again, why is the left allowed to call for killing people over and over again?
[02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:02.000]  They're crazed and aggressive and violent.
[02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:04.000]  But we're the extremists.
[02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:05.000]  These are actually...
[02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:06.000]  Stop being aggressive.
[02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:08.000]  We've got a story in the UK at the moment, for example.
[02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:15.000]  A diversity officer at a major university, she banned white men from attending a diversity event.
[02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:17.000]  She still remains in the position.
[02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:22.000]  Then it came out that she had tweeted under the hashtag, kill all white men.
[02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:26.000]  And they all support her and the university has refused to fire her.
[02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:29.000]  Well, that's like the diversity head of Sweden joining ISIS.
[02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:31.000]  But let's expand on that, Paul.
[02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:36.000]  US Army soldiers wear red high heels and march in public now.
[02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:37.000]  Yeah.
[02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:44.000]  I mean, in Sweden, politicians there are talking about bringing back jihadists who have fought with ISIS
[02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:49.000]  and giving them jobs and counseling at taxpayer expense,
[02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:52.000]  which, you know, the Swedish troops don't even get.
[02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:56.000]  So it's again, extreme liberalism is a mental disorder.
[02:48:56.000 --> 02:49:00.000]  And in places like Sweden, they've literally got, you know, rapes off the charts.
[02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:07.000]  They've got entire Muslim, no go area ghettos where fire crews, ambulances get attacked.
[02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:13.000]  But now they're talking about giving them jobs and counseling and making the taxpayer pay for it for ISIS terrorists.
[02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:15.000]  And that's liberal.
[02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:18.000]  What it is, is these are deviants at the end of the day.
[02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:19.000]  That's why they're like, I'm an anarchist.
[02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:20.000]  I'm a Satanist.
[02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:21.000]  I love killing my kids.
[02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:23.000]  I love, you know, my armpit hair.
[02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:26.000]  I love, you know, I don't use mayonnaise.
[02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:27.000]  I spread poop on my bread.
[02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:30.000]  I mean, that's basically who these people are.
[02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:34.000]  Is there like a bad cat that like urinates on the furniture?
[02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:41.000]  I mean, they're just screwed up people that could only survive in this rich, decadent society that they want to destroy.
[02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:46.000]  I mean, these people wouldn't survive 10 minutes in the jungle in a barbarous fight.
[02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:49.000]  I mean, these people are a joke because there's no one to get free stuff from.
[02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:50.000]  They'd be looking around.
[02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:52.000]  Where's the free food?
[02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:55.000]  Are the fish not coming out of the stream to jump into my plate?
[02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:56.000]  No, it's not how it works.
[02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:57.000]  You got to actually catch the fish.
[02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:59.000]  And we did some research on some of these people.
[02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:01.000]  They're failed artists is what it is.
[02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:03.000]  They're just disgruntled artists.
[02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:08.000]  They're, oh, the system's so bad because they just kill everybody and shoot police.
[02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:10.000]  That'll fix it.
[02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:19.000]  And that's their answer to police brutality is to usher in a totalitarian regime that's responsible for the deaths of tens of millions of people.
[02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:24.000]  Imagine if these idiots who can't even tie their shoelaces tried to go kill a bunch of cops.
[02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:25.000]  What happened to them?
[02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:27.000]  They go attack a bunch of trained killers.
[02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:30.000]  It just shows how stupid they are.
[02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:32.000]  I mean, look what happened to those bikers up in Waco.
[02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:36.000]  They didn't last very long up when they were getting shot at by the cops.
[02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:38.000]  Well, that way more and more that is looking like a setup.
[02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:39.000]  Like maybe one guy pulled a gun out.
[02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:41.000]  They want to start a war on the biker groups.
[02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:46.000]  And I mean, I don't like some of the outlaw motorcycle clubs, but there is a war against anything American.
[02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:48.000]  And they leave all the Mexican drug cartels alone.
[02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:52.000]  They're coming after the biker gangs because a lot of times they're actually patriotic.
[02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:54.000]  Putting the commies run free.
[02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:55.000]  That's Joe Bezos looking into that.
[02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:56.000]  We'll be right back with Paul Watson.
[02:50:56.000 --> 02:51:25.000]  I'm Alex Johnson.
[02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:52.000]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:52.000 --> 02:52:18.000]  We'll be right back.
[02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:44.000]  We'll be right back.
[02:52:44.000 --> 02:53:10.000]  We'll be right back.
[02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:36.000]  We'll be right back.
[02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:58.000]  We'll be right back.
[02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:33.000]  We'll be right back.
[02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:59.000]  We'll be right back.
[02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:25.000]  We'll be right back.
[02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:51.000]  We'll be right back.
[02:55:51.000 --> 02:56:17.000]  We'll be right back.
[02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:44.000]  We'll be right back.
[02:56:44.000 --> 02:57:06.000]  We'll be right back.
[02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:32.000]  We'll be right back.
[02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:58.000]  We'll be right back.
[02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:24.000]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:48.000]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:48.000 --> 02:59:14.000]  We'll be right back.
[02:59:14.000 --> 02:59:40.000]  We'll be right back.
[02:59:40.000 --> 03:00:06.000]  We'll be right back.
[03:00:06.000 --> 03:00:28.000]  We'll be right back.
[03:00:28.000 --> 03:00:54.000]  We'll be right back.
[03:00:54.000 --> 03:01:20.000]  We'll be right back.
[03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:46.000]  We'll be right back.
[03:01:46.000 --> 03:02:08.000]  We'll be right back.
[03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:36.000]  We'll be right back.
[03:02:36.000 --> 03:02:58.000]  We'll be right back.
[03:02:58.000 --> 03:03:20.000]  We'll be right back.
[03:03:20.000 --> 03:03:46.000]  We'll be right back.
[03:03:46.000 --> 03:04:14.000]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:14.000 --> 03:04:40.000]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:40.000 --> 03:05:06.000]  We'll be right back.
[03:05:06.000 --> 03:05:32.000]  We'll be right back.
[03:05:32.000 --> 03:05:58.000]  We'll be right back.
[03:05:58.000 --> 03:06:24.000]  We'll be right back.
[03:06:24.000 --> 03:06:50.000]  We'll be right back.
[03:06:50.000 --> 03:07:16.000]  We'll be right back.
[03:07:16.000 --> 03:07:42.000]  We'll be right back.
[03:07:42.000 --> 03:08:10.000]  We'll be right back.
[03:08:10.000 --> 03:08:18.000]  We'll be right back.
[03:08:18.000 --> 03:08:21.000]  We're back live going to the bottom of the hour.
[03:08:21.000 --> 03:08:26.000]  Now with former Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs and Studio back from Cleveland waiting for that verdict.
[03:08:26.000 --> 03:08:31.000]  We've got Rob Duce still writing shot done with us as well.
[03:08:31.000 --> 03:08:41.000]  The headline conspiracy theories are causing militants to abandon ISIS that's the official ISIS Al Qaeda magazine they've put you in some of their videos and full wars and others.
[03:08:41.000 --> 03:08:45.000]  We've told folks even before that happened that they've been sending threats over here.
[03:08:45.000 --> 03:08:48.000]  The law enforcement is aware of that.
[03:08:48.000 --> 03:08:50.000]  Before we were aware of it.
[03:08:50.000 --> 03:09:02.000]  These are real threats again Al Qaeda is now being disbanded.
[03:09:02.000 --> 03:09:10.000]  ISIS now is a giant 300,000 person armed group recruiting out of the entire world but mainly Saudi Arabia.
[03:09:10.000 --> 03:09:21.000]  They're trying to take over Syria the military found out about it wouldn't be part of backing them.
[03:09:21.000 --> 03:09:27.000]  That wasn't enough so they've been air supplying them because the troops will not land and give them the weapons.
[03:09:27.000 --> 03:09:31.000]  So they tell the troops will drop on this grid and it's really ISIS.
[03:09:31.000 --> 03:09:34.000]  So then our own military tells the Iraqi president what's happening.
[03:09:34.000 --> 03:09:36.000]  He goes public.
[03:09:36.000 --> 03:09:41.000]  He goes to the media.
[03:09:41.000 --> 03:09:43.000]  The told us it had been a lot and things were fake.
[03:09:43.000 --> 03:09:44.000]  Now it's coming out.
[03:09:44.000 --> 03:09:46.000]  I'm not bragging it's scary actually.
[03:09:46.000 --> 03:09:50.000]  We explained how this is all fake with ISIS with people like Steve Pachanin, Conkernal, Schaefer and I mean real sources.
[03:09:50.000 --> 03:09:52.000]  Real sources.
[03:09:52.000 --> 03:09:55.000]  So now they are hopping mad at us right now.
[03:09:55.000 --> 03:09:58.000]  Conspiracy theorists are causing militants to abandon ISIS.
[03:09:58.000 --> 03:10:01.000]  And they've specifically attacked info wars.
[03:10:01.000 --> 03:10:06.000]  Now you've got a group of veterans building army raising funds to put down the rabid dogs of ISIS.
[03:10:06.000 --> 03:10:11.000]  And Joe was saying he wants to go join them as a video embed and also kill some of them.
[03:10:11.000 --> 03:10:13.000]  I'd be fine with that.
[03:10:13.000 --> 03:10:15.000]  You know Al Qaeda people are scum.
[03:10:15.000 --> 03:10:16.000]  They're a real terror group.
[03:10:16.000 --> 03:10:19.000]  The problem is you got to expose its globalist run.
[03:10:19.000 --> 03:10:25.000]  That's what will make their people quit and leave because the bots at the grassroots don't know up the chain.
[03:10:25.000 --> 03:10:28.000]  They're basically run by a hydra or a specter type group.
[03:10:28.000 --> 03:10:32.000]  And it isn't that the criminals in government imitate specter hydra.
[03:10:32.000 --> 03:10:35.000]  Fleming wrote the James Bond stuff.
[03:10:35.000 --> 03:10:37.000]  He was MI6 high level spy chief.
[03:10:37.000 --> 03:10:39.000]  That's how it works.
[03:10:39.000 --> 03:10:41.000]  There is a global hydra.
[03:10:41.000 --> 03:10:46.000]  In fact that's even the intelligence people I've had on and people that have written books about it.
[03:10:46.000 --> 03:10:48.000]  People like Colonel Craig Roberts.
[03:10:48.000 --> 03:10:55.000]  You know he wrote a whole book on the octopus project and called it a hydra.
[03:10:55.000 --> 03:10:57.000]  That's what it is.
[03:10:57.000 --> 03:10:59.000]  So you go see a Captain America.
[03:10:59.000 --> 03:11:00.000]  They call it hydra.
[03:11:00.000 --> 03:11:01.000]  You go see a James Bond movie.
[03:11:01.000 --> 03:11:02.000]  They call it specter.
[03:11:02.000 --> 03:11:04.000]  That's what Bilderberg group is.
[03:11:04.000 --> 03:11:09.000]  That's why they said it didn't exist at first and then we went and forced them to admit it exists.
[03:11:09.000 --> 03:11:12.000]  Now they say it's no big deal that have a security company.
[03:11:12.000 --> 03:11:16.000]  Do's going to be there covering it with Paul Watson and others called Cobra.
[03:11:16.000 --> 03:11:18.000]  You cannot make this up.
[03:11:18.000 --> 03:11:21.000]  Cobra's headquarters actually is in a castle.
[03:11:21.000 --> 03:11:23.000]  I mean it gets so weird.
[03:11:23.000 --> 03:11:24.000]  I'm getting some pictures of it.
[03:11:24.000 --> 03:11:25.000]  I'm going to be doing a report on that.
[03:11:25.000 --> 03:11:27.000]  Cobra.
[03:11:27.000 --> 03:11:30.000]  In 1973 they moved their headquarters to such and such castle.
[03:11:30.000 --> 03:11:31.000]  I'm like what?
[03:11:31.000 --> 03:11:32.000]  Hail Cobra.
[03:11:32.000 --> 03:11:34.000]  You cannot make this stuff up.
[03:11:34.000 --> 03:11:40.000]  A security force called Cobra based in a castle is going to be protecting the biggest conglomerate.
[03:11:40.000 --> 03:11:42.000]  Because where do you think these authors get all this?
[03:11:42.000 --> 03:11:44.000]  They're imitating real life.
[03:11:44.000 --> 03:11:45.000]  It's not the other way around.
[03:11:45.000 --> 03:11:46.000]  Exactly.
[03:11:46.000 --> 03:11:47.000]  I've been ranting.
[03:11:47.000 --> 03:11:51.000]  Biggs give us your take on first off these troops say they want to go in.
[03:11:51.000 --> 03:11:57.000]  Will they be allowed to go in with an imbeb with Iraqi forces?
[03:11:57.000 --> 03:12:05.000]  And then what do you make of Al Qaeda, a.k.a. ISIS, Islamic State upset that we're waking up the idiots they're trying to recruit?
[03:12:05.000 --> 03:12:08.000]  Well I think they'll go in kind of like these contractor groups.
[03:12:08.000 --> 03:12:14.000]  Like the Blackwaters, the XC's, all these different groups out there and operate that way.
[03:12:14.000 --> 03:12:18.000]  They'll go in, they can get a group of people and just go over and fight.
[03:12:18.000 --> 03:12:19.000]  I mean it's the same thing.
[03:12:19.000 --> 03:12:20.000]  That's what a contracting group is.
[03:12:20.000 --> 03:12:21.000]  I don't see how it would be any different.
[03:12:21.000 --> 03:12:25.000]  So I'm sure they'll get a lot of people who are trained, who are willing to go over there and do it.
[03:12:25.000 --> 03:12:31.000]  And I just think it would be interesting to film that and try to get it out live to actually expose a lot of the stuff that goes on.
[03:12:31.000 --> 03:12:36.000]  Because a lot of the stuff that happens in combat, when it's filmed in these wars, by the time it gets back to the states,
[03:12:36.000 --> 03:12:40.000]  it's been cut and edited by the army, whoever, and you kind of only see bits and pieces of what's going on.
[03:12:40.000 --> 03:12:44.000]  So you're going to reach out to this group and say if they deploy, you want to go?
[03:12:44.000 --> 03:12:45.000]  Yeah.
[03:12:45.000 --> 03:12:50.000]  What will really be interesting is when they're finding dead fighters, ISIS fighters, looking at their guns,
[03:12:50.000 --> 03:12:53.000]  looking at the stuff they're using and seeing where everyone's just made in the USA.
[03:12:53.000 --> 03:12:55.000]  Well you said you want to go further though, Joe.
[03:12:55.000 --> 03:12:56.000]  You said you want to...
[03:12:56.000 --> 03:12:58.000]  Oh yeah, I'll take them out.
[03:12:58.000 --> 03:13:01.000]  I mean they're sending me tweets saying that I'm the face of evil.
[03:13:01.000 --> 03:13:04.000]  So I kind of feel like it's my duty now to, you know, let them see that face.
[03:13:04.000 --> 03:13:05.000]  Here's the problem, Joe.
[03:13:05.000 --> 03:13:10.000]  Now that you're political, they may try to pat Tillman you if we send you over there and it'd be friendly fire or something.
[03:13:10.000 --> 03:13:11.000]  Hmm?
[03:13:11.000 --> 03:13:12.000]  It's always a possibility.
[03:13:12.000 --> 03:13:14.000]  I can get hit by a bus.
[03:13:14.000 --> 03:13:15.000]  I mean, watch out.
[03:13:15.000 --> 03:13:16.000]  I mean, you're a good guy.
[03:13:16.000 --> 03:13:18.000]  I'll send your ass over there again, but I don't really want to do that.
[03:13:18.000 --> 03:13:24.000]  I mean, I mean, I just got a chance at walking outside right now and getting hit by a car or struck by lightning.
[03:13:24.000 --> 03:13:26.000]  I might as well go out there and fight these guys.
[03:13:26.000 --> 03:13:29.000]  And you're not going to make him take shots before he goes out there, either.
[03:13:29.000 --> 03:13:30.000]  No.
[03:13:30.000 --> 03:13:31.000]  No.
[03:13:31.000 --> 03:13:32.000]  No vaccines.
[03:13:32.000 --> 03:13:33.000]  No vaccines.
[03:13:33.000 --> 03:13:34.000]  I don't know, Joe.
[03:13:34.000 --> 03:13:35.000]  I'm just sending you off to potential death.
[03:13:35.000 --> 03:13:41.000]  I think it'll be a lot more dangerous going to fight ISIS than it will be driving your car, but I get it.
[03:13:41.000 --> 03:13:49.000]  But I mean, what do you make of them openly upset that quote conspiracy theorists and they name us and some of their videos are hurting their recruitment?
[03:13:49.000 --> 03:13:50.000]  It was funny though, too, though.
[03:13:50.000 --> 03:13:58.000]  I was watching a Fox report where they said they released some of the books that Bin Laden had at the compound and it was bloodlines of the Illuminati and a bunch of books like that.
[03:13:58.000 --> 03:13:59.000]  Well, we published that.
[03:13:59.000 --> 03:14:00.000]  Yeah.
[03:14:00.000 --> 03:14:02.000]  Those are the books that he had with him there.
[03:14:02.000 --> 03:14:04.000]  And then you have this going on.
[03:14:04.000 --> 03:14:05.000]  I mean, it's just funny.
[03:14:05.000 --> 03:14:07.000]  By the way, let's get Fritz Springmeier on.
[03:14:07.000 --> 03:14:09.000]  I forgot to tell Nico to do that.
[03:14:09.000 --> 03:14:10.000]  He's booked for next Thursday.
[03:14:10.000 --> 03:14:12.000]  He's already booked for next Thursday.
[03:14:12.000 --> 03:14:13.000]  There you go.
[03:14:13.000 --> 03:14:14.000]  Great minds.
[03:14:14.000 --> 03:14:15.000]  Think alike.
[03:14:15.000 --> 03:14:17.000]  He's on Obama's reading list.
[03:14:17.000 --> 03:14:19.000]  I almost said Obama, but that's so weird.
[03:14:19.000 --> 03:14:22.000]  It's on his body doubles reading list.
[03:14:22.000 --> 03:14:24.000]  Nevertheless, it's interesting.
[03:14:24.000 --> 03:14:27.000]  Let's shift gears into this Reuters article.
[03:14:27.000 --> 03:14:28.000]  He told me this.
[03:14:28.000 --> 03:14:31.000]  I believed it, but I double-taked.
[03:14:31.000 --> 03:14:35.000]  The state police are saying, don't ride your motorcycles basically anywhere in the state.
[03:14:35.000 --> 03:14:42.000]  They've closed down Harley-Davidson dealerships saying they don't know if you're going to attack police.
[03:14:42.000 --> 03:14:48.000]  So now the motorcycle clubs, 99% of them are good people, mainly veterans, patriots.
[03:14:48.000 --> 03:14:49.000]  They just like to go out and have fun.
[03:14:49.000 --> 03:14:50.000]  A lot of them are Christian.
[03:14:50.000 --> 03:14:53.000]  That's the most common motorcycle gang I see are ministries.
[03:14:53.000 --> 03:14:58.000]  Now they're saying, have they seen any type of team jacket or group jacket or MC jacket
[03:14:58.000 --> 03:15:00.000]  that they might be terrorist?
[03:15:00.000 --> 03:15:06.000]  Or as if the Banditos, who I've criticized before because they've acted like thugs in
[03:15:06.000 --> 03:15:11.000]  my presence, as if they would want to go out and start killing cops.
[03:15:11.000 --> 03:15:14.000]  Well, motorcycle clubs have pride in their uniform.
[03:15:14.000 --> 03:15:15.000]  They don't take off their cut.
[03:15:15.000 --> 03:15:16.000]  And that's what you call it, a cut.
[03:15:16.000 --> 03:15:18.000]  They don't take that off.
[03:15:18.000 --> 03:15:22.000]  So a civilian riding around, that's obviously civilian.
[03:15:22.000 --> 03:15:24.000]  These guys, they get hounded.
[03:15:24.000 --> 03:15:25.000]  They get penalized.
[03:15:25.000 --> 03:15:29.000]  They can lose rank, so to say, if they're seen out in public and not wearing their cut.
[03:15:29.000 --> 03:15:30.000]  And that's how that works.
[03:15:30.000 --> 03:15:31.000]  It's a pride thing.
[03:15:31.000 --> 03:15:32.000]  That's their uniform.
[03:15:32.000 --> 03:15:35.000]  They fight to get that, to that, that patch.
[03:15:35.000 --> 03:15:36.000]  They have to prospect.
[03:15:36.000 --> 03:15:39.000]  They have to do all these different things to become that.
[03:15:39.000 --> 03:15:41.000]  And once they get that, that becomes their life.
[03:15:41.000 --> 03:15:42.000]  It's the brotherhood.
[03:15:42.000 --> 03:15:46.000]  It's the family of them existing together and having each other's backs.
[03:15:46.000 --> 03:15:48.000]  You know, it's your brother before yourself.
[03:15:48.000 --> 03:15:49.000]  And that's the way they look.
[03:15:49.000 --> 03:15:50.000]  That's their whole lifestyle.
[03:15:50.000 --> 03:15:54.000]  And it's really strange because a lot of these guys, or most of them that were shot,
[03:15:54.000 --> 03:15:56.000]  they had headshots and chest shots.
[03:15:56.000 --> 03:16:01.000]  Now, if there's two rival gangs having a shootout at a twins peak, don't you think there's going
[03:16:01.000 --> 03:16:06.000]  to be a lot of stray shots in the shoulder, the chest, the stomach, the legs, the head,
[03:16:06.000 --> 03:16:11.000]  some, some grazes, not center mass in the head and in the chest.
[03:16:11.000 --> 03:16:13.000]  That seems like something that's been set up.
[03:16:13.000 --> 03:16:17.000]  It means people were kind of just standing there when it happened.
[03:16:17.000 --> 03:16:18.000]  Well, they said SWAT was there.
[03:16:18.000 --> 03:16:20.000]  Yeah, SWAT was there.
[03:16:20.000 --> 03:16:24.000]  They already, they already contacted the Twin Peaks management prior to that happening,
[03:16:24.000 --> 03:16:25.000]  saying, hey, you guys.
[03:16:25.000 --> 03:16:26.000]  Sure.
[03:16:26.000 --> 03:16:29.000]  And if guys are running around a firefight, as you were describing in there, doing the
[03:16:29.000 --> 03:16:35.000]  moves, even with good, good snipers, they would be grazing, missing and things instead.
[03:16:35.000 --> 03:16:36.000]  It's all dead on.
[03:16:36.000 --> 03:16:40.000]  Yeah, these guys have to be from really good positions from far back where they don't have
[03:16:40.000 --> 03:16:43.000]  to worry about catching any kind of rounds from anything.
[03:16:43.000 --> 03:16:48.000]  And the only, the only round that I've heard of being fired by an MC member came out of
[03:16:48.000 --> 03:16:52.000]  the Twin Peaks restaurant, popped one shot and ran back in and hid.
[03:16:52.000 --> 03:16:55.000]  And that's the only thing I can find so far.
[03:16:55.000 --> 03:16:57.000]  And the security footage shows them running for cover.
[03:16:57.000 --> 03:16:58.000]  Yes, running for cover.
[03:16:58.000 --> 03:16:59.000]  It doesn't show them fighting.
[03:16:59.000 --> 03:17:01.000]  You know, they're not like, hey, we're going to come here and fight.
[03:17:01.000 --> 03:17:06.000]  I've got a buddy who's friend is the head of the Banditos North Houston chapter.
[03:17:06.000 --> 03:17:08.000]  And they said no shots were fired by them.
[03:17:08.000 --> 03:17:09.000]  None.
[03:17:09.000 --> 03:17:10.000]  It was the cops.
[03:17:10.000 --> 03:17:11.000]  Completely.
[03:17:11.000 --> 03:17:13.000]  Well, I know this.
[03:17:13.000 --> 03:17:16.000]  I'm going to get an article up on MFallWars.com.
[03:17:16.000 --> 03:17:22.000]  Law enforcement officials say Banditos MC plan to kill cops with C4 mall off cocktails.
[03:17:22.000 --> 03:17:25.000]  Group disputes claim says Obama would call out military.
[03:17:25.000 --> 03:17:26.000]  They tried to kill cops.
[03:17:26.000 --> 03:17:28.000]  Just think about this though.
[03:17:28.000 --> 03:17:31.000]  There's probably some, you know, undercover fed guys in these MCs.
[03:17:31.000 --> 03:17:35.000]  They're trying to take them down and they're like, hey, man, whatever we're trying to do
[03:17:35.000 --> 03:17:36.000]  isn't working.
[03:17:36.000 --> 03:17:37.000]  Let's stage something.
[03:17:37.000 --> 03:17:41.000]  You know, that's another way that things like that could go down because it's time and time
[03:17:41.000 --> 03:17:45.000]  again, those kind of people infiltrate everything, especially a motorcycle club.
[03:17:45.000 --> 03:17:46.000]  Yeah.
[03:17:46.000 --> 03:17:50.000]  I was reading they infiltrate mainline motorcycle clubs.
[03:17:50.000 --> 03:17:51.000]  Yeah.
[03:17:51.000 --> 03:17:54.000]  I mean, it's possible, but I mean, you know, the Banditos are one percenters.
[03:17:54.000 --> 03:17:56.000]  I mean, that's a lot of drug running math, things like that.
[03:17:56.000 --> 03:17:58.000]  I wonder what they're going to do.
[03:17:58.000 --> 03:18:00.000]  There's a Sturgis rally in the summertime.
[03:18:00.000 --> 03:18:02.000]  And I think we have rock rally happening.
[03:18:02.000 --> 03:18:03.000]  Yeah.
[03:18:03.000 --> 03:18:06.000]  So I wonder what's going to happen here in Texas, the rot rally right after that.
[03:18:06.000 --> 03:18:08.000]  I mean, they even try to stop it.
[03:18:08.000 --> 03:18:10.000]  Am I a criminal now because I ride a motorcycle?
[03:18:10.000 --> 03:18:14.000]  I mean, that's what I want to find out is if I roll up in the Waco on my bike.
[03:18:14.000 --> 03:18:18.000]  Am I going to be shot at by these snipers that they say they have set up out there?
[03:18:18.000 --> 03:18:19.000]  Yeah, that's the big news.
[03:18:19.000 --> 03:18:20.000]  That's why you're here.
[03:18:20.000 --> 03:18:24.000]  I forgot to mention that in this Reuters article, they say snipers are set up on I-35.
[03:18:24.000 --> 03:18:25.000]  Yeah.
[03:18:25.000 --> 03:18:28.000]  So now you're riding a motorcycle and wearing a leather jacket.
[03:18:28.000 --> 03:18:29.000]  Are you being targeted?
[03:18:29.000 --> 03:18:32.000]  Well, I've got a leather vest, so I'm going to wear all that stuff.
[03:18:32.000 --> 03:18:35.000]  I'm thinking I'm going to wear my bulletproof vest this time.
[03:18:35.000 --> 03:18:39.000]  But, you know, it's interesting that they're going to go to that kind of link to say,
[03:18:39.000 --> 03:18:42.000]  all right, you're not going to go after the motorcycle club.
[03:18:42.000 --> 03:18:45.000]  You're completely like banning the motorcycle.
[03:18:45.000 --> 03:18:48.000]  That's like, that's like, that'd be like if somebody ran over somebody with a blue Ford truck,
[03:18:48.000 --> 03:18:50.000]  you're going to ban all trucks.
[03:18:50.000 --> 03:18:52.000]  But they almost did that in LA.
[03:18:52.000 --> 03:18:54.000]  They started shooting at everybody that had a pickup.
[03:18:54.000 --> 03:18:55.000]  Wouldn't even the right color.
[03:18:55.000 --> 03:18:59.000]  I mean, they just overreact to everything.
[03:18:59.000 --> 03:19:03.000]  And when the cops were there, if the cops didn't want any trouble,
[03:19:03.000 --> 03:19:06.000]  why didn't they stop the people from getting together if they were so worried about something happening?
[03:19:06.000 --> 03:19:08.000]  Block out a block on the parking lot.
[03:19:08.000 --> 03:19:11.000]  It's just like when I was in the military, we had prior acknowledgement of something.
[03:19:11.000 --> 03:19:15.000]  We would go and be proactive and try to stop it before it got out of control.
[03:19:15.000 --> 03:19:16.000]  That's all.
[03:19:16.000 --> 03:19:18.000]  That's the whole thing with a peace force.
[03:19:18.000 --> 03:19:20.000]  You're supposed to be a peace force.
[03:19:20.000 --> 03:19:22.000]  You should be there.
[03:19:22.000 --> 03:19:24.000]  Deescalate the situation before it escalates.
[03:19:24.000 --> 03:19:28.000]  You're saying the military was more of a peace force than what you're saying from the police.
[03:19:28.000 --> 03:19:31.000]  What I've seen since I've been back, yes.
[03:19:31.000 --> 03:19:35.000]  In a lot of instances, way more than you would think.
[03:19:35.000 --> 03:19:40.000]  Well, that's the problem militarization of police is you then escalate.
[03:19:40.000 --> 03:19:44.000]  And there's a reason smart governments have non-military police.
[03:19:44.000 --> 03:19:47.000]  It's because they understand it ends up causing civil wars.
[03:19:47.000 --> 03:19:52.000]  When you have the police turn into a military, it's what started us in 1776.
[03:19:52.000 --> 03:19:56.000]  Final segment with some other breaking news straight ahead on TPP.

[03:23:20.000 --> 03:23:30.000]  That's 800-274-3070 to get your four-week food supply for the incredible price of only $99.
[03:23:30.000 --> 03:23:40.000]  That's 800-274-3070 to get your four-week food supply for the incredible price of only $99.
[03:23:40.000 --> 03:23:50.000]  That's 800-274-3070 to get your four-week food supply for the incredible price of only $99.
[03:23:50.000 --> 03:24:00.000]  That's 800-274-3070 to get your four-week food supply for the incredible price of only $99.
[03:24:00.000 --> 03:24:10.000]  There must be some kind of way out of here to joke it a little bit. There's too much confusion.
[03:24:10.000 --> 03:24:14.000]  I can't get no relief.
[03:24:14.000 --> 03:24:18.000]  Like I said, it's hard to turn this off. Crank it up.
[03:24:18.000 --> 03:24:22.000]  There must be some kind of way out of here.
[03:24:22.000 --> 03:24:24.000]  Said I'd joke up to the thieves.
[03:24:24.000 --> 03:24:26.000]  Too much confusion.
[03:24:26.000 --> 03:24:28.000]  There's too much confusion.
[03:24:28.000 --> 03:24:30.000]  Get out on purpose.
[03:24:30.000 --> 03:24:32.000]  The world's too confusing.
[03:24:32.000 --> 03:24:38.000]  The globalists control the foundations and the systems and the central banks, and they're in control.
[03:24:38.000 --> 03:24:42.000]  They create chaos, but only to then pose as the saviors.
[03:24:42.000 --> 03:24:47.000]  But we see through their eyes, we know their battle plan, and we are decompartmentalizing it.
[03:24:47.000 --> 03:24:54.000]  Obama's trade bill narrowly clears Key Senate hurdle, and even CNBC saying don't do it.
[03:24:54.000 --> 03:25:00.000]  That's the top story right now. Republicans help pass it with Obama to give him fast track.
[03:25:00.000 --> 03:25:03.000]  Now it's got to go through a few other hurdles, but then it's done.
[03:25:03.000 --> 03:25:07.000]  This is really bad news, and it just shows how to control these people are.
[03:25:07.000 --> 03:25:10.000]  Quick comments from Joe Beggs and Rob Dew on this.
[03:25:10.000 --> 03:25:12.000]  I want to shift gears into the situation.
[03:25:12.000 --> 03:25:15.000]  I'll stay at the abortuary.
[03:25:15.000 --> 03:25:17.000]  Secret bill. You can't read it.
[03:25:17.000 --> 03:25:23.000]  And the Republican leadership working with Obama to trump liberals and Tea Party people.
[03:25:23.000 --> 03:25:28.000]  Real liberals are smart on some issues, like GMO and this, and notice the Tea Parties with them as well.
[03:25:28.000 --> 03:25:33.000]  Exactly. We have to find those issues that we both agree on and attack at that moment.
[03:25:33.000 --> 03:25:38.000]  This is where we agree upon let's go fight the empire, you know, on real issues.
[03:25:38.000 --> 03:25:39.000]  That's right.
[03:25:39.000 --> 03:25:41.000]  I mean, what we're going to start doing, sir, you want to buy a car?
[03:25:41.000 --> 03:25:44.000]  Well, first you have to pay for it, and then we're going to tell you to get afterwards.
[03:25:44.000 --> 03:25:50.000]  You want to go to this concert? We want you to pay for it first, and then you get there, and it's like 10 hours of Miley Cyrus.
[03:25:50.000 --> 03:25:56.000]  I mean, that's ridiculous that I have to wait on it to pass before I can find out what it is.
[03:25:56.000 --> 03:25:59.000]  Yeah, come see our movie where I can tell you what it is.
[03:25:59.000 --> 03:26:01.000]  That's John Ashcroft singing.
[03:26:01.000 --> 03:26:06.000]  What the eagle saw, like it's never sawed before.
[03:26:06.000 --> 03:26:08.000]  But I mean, but they think we're crazy to question that.
[03:26:08.000 --> 03:26:12.000]  Meanwhile, if you ask them to do something like that, like, all right, go pay for this car.
[03:26:12.000 --> 03:26:13.000]  It's going to be $45,000.
[03:26:13.000 --> 03:26:15.000]  That's the same thing with the FCC.
[03:26:15.000 --> 03:26:16.000]  Like IKEA.
[03:26:16.000 --> 03:26:24.000]  Exactly. Let's play the devil cupcake out there at the Abortuary yesterday saying she killed her kids.
[03:26:24.000 --> 03:26:25.000]  Here it is.
[03:26:25.000 --> 03:26:27.000]  I kill my kids.
[03:26:27.000 --> 03:26:30.000]  I kill my kids.
[03:26:30.000 --> 03:26:32.000]  And we've got him saying, we don't save our arms.
[03:26:32.000 --> 03:26:34.000]  We love the devil.
[03:26:34.000 --> 03:26:37.000]  You know, I'm just glad I wasn't out there.
[03:26:37.000 --> 03:26:41.000]  I mean, I would have probably been a little too angry and not been able to control.
[03:26:41.000 --> 03:26:42.000]  What was you done with that?
[03:26:42.000 --> 03:26:43.000]  Did you see the vampire guy coming?
[03:26:43.000 --> 03:26:45.000]  You told me you were at the airport. Describe that.
[03:26:45.000 --> 03:26:50.000]  Oh, yeah. So I'm sitting in Chicago midway at the airport at some little like Irish bar or whatever.
[03:26:50.000 --> 03:26:54.000]  So I've holding up my, my big phone and everyone like I've got him over my shoulder.
[03:26:54.000 --> 03:26:57.000]  We're all sitting here watching like what is going on?
[03:26:57.000 --> 03:26:58.000]  This guy runs up.
[03:26:58.000 --> 03:27:02.000]  He's like trying to swing at you and then grab the microphone and I'm sitting there just yelling in the bar.
[03:27:02.000 --> 03:27:04.000]  I was like, someone chase that guy down.
[03:27:04.000 --> 03:27:05.000]  Choke up.
[03:27:05.000 --> 03:27:12.000]  And everyone in the bar is just like, when I got back watching the rebroadcast, you know, the crew back there did a great job.
[03:27:12.000 --> 03:27:15.000]  They were bringing in all the elements, putting stuff on the screens.
[03:27:15.000 --> 03:27:22.000]  I mean, just really using the studio to its full effect and just being able to, you know, eviscerate their blank arguments that they had while we were there.
[03:27:22.000 --> 03:27:25.000]  Hey, you're the guy that runs the local red brigade.
[03:27:25.000 --> 03:27:26.000]  No, we're not.
[03:27:26.000 --> 03:27:28.000]  Yeah, you got a Facebook with you all with commie flags.
[03:27:28.000 --> 03:27:30.000]  What? You're crazy racist.
[03:27:30.000 --> 03:27:31.000]  Yeah, you talked to them.
[03:27:31.000 --> 03:27:33.000]  You talked to them and then it cuts them.
[03:27:33.000 --> 03:27:34.000]  We love mail.
[03:27:34.000 --> 03:27:35.000]  Kill everyone.
[03:27:35.000 --> 03:27:37.000]  Weren't they asking for donations on their website too?
[03:27:37.000 --> 03:27:39.000]  So they're using capitalistic ways of push communism.
[03:27:39.000 --> 03:27:43.000]  They had a guy in a brand new $80,000 Jaguar pull up and drop him off.
[03:27:43.000 --> 03:27:47.000]  That's probably that time when she was driving a brand new like $40,000 Honda.
[03:27:47.000 --> 03:27:49.000]  Trust one babies.
[03:27:49.000 --> 03:27:51.000]  Oh yeah, they're getting back at daddy big time.
[03:27:51.000 --> 03:27:53.000]  Don't worry, daddy's proud.
[03:27:53.000 --> 03:27:58.000]  Soros, we're attracted back to this professor where we're narrowing down the Soros link.
[03:27:58.000 --> 03:27:59.000]  I can't wait.
[03:27:59.000 --> 03:28:01.000]  Yeah, my henpeck story that happened this morning.
[03:28:01.000 --> 03:28:04.000]  I was pulling up into the doctor's office.
[03:28:04.000 --> 03:28:06.000]  Go go with my wife or having another baby.
[03:28:06.000 --> 03:28:09.000]  And they had this compact car for kids.
[03:28:09.000 --> 03:28:11.000]  That carbon footprint is a little big.
[03:28:11.000 --> 03:28:12.000]  That's right.
[03:28:12.000 --> 03:28:13.000]  That's right.
[03:28:13.000 --> 03:28:16.000]  Well, so there's a ton of of handicapped spots that are open.
[03:28:16.000 --> 03:28:17.000]  So I can't park there.
[03:28:17.000 --> 03:28:19.000]  So I go to where it's a compact car.
[03:28:19.000 --> 03:28:20.000]  It's the only spots that are open.
[03:28:20.000 --> 03:28:23.000]  And the spot that I pulled in was even bigger than the compact car spots,
[03:28:23.000 --> 03:28:24.000]  but it was in that area.
[03:28:24.000 --> 03:28:28.000]  And I get out in the guy in the, in the cart and little, the golf cart goes,
[03:28:28.000 --> 03:28:29.000]  did you read the sign?
[03:28:29.000 --> 03:28:30.000]  I was like, yeah, it says no skateboards.
[03:28:30.000 --> 03:28:31.000]  He was, did you read the sign?
[03:28:31.000 --> 03:28:33.000]  I said, it says no bikes parked over here.
[03:28:33.000 --> 03:28:34.000]  He was, no, the other son.
[03:28:34.000 --> 03:28:36.000]  I said, oh yeah, compact cars.
[03:28:36.000 --> 03:28:39.000]  He goes, well, why don't you just wait for somebody to pull up?
[03:28:39.000 --> 03:28:41.000]  I said, look, dude, I'm in a spot.
[03:28:41.000 --> 03:28:43.000]  I'm pulled up farther than the compact cars.
[03:28:43.000 --> 03:28:44.000]  Look, you could see it.
[03:28:44.000 --> 03:28:45.000]  Get a tape measure.
[03:28:45.000 --> 03:28:47.000]  He goes, oh, what are you getting all been out of shape for?
[03:28:47.000 --> 03:28:49.000]  I'm like, you're hand packing me, bro.
[03:28:49.000 --> 03:28:51.000]  If you're going to start it, I'm going to finish it.
[03:28:51.000 --> 03:28:53.000]  And he goes, I just wanted to show your son how stupid you are.
[03:28:53.000 --> 03:28:54.000]  It says there with my son.
[03:28:54.000 --> 03:28:55.000]  I'm like, really?
[03:28:55.000 --> 03:28:56.000]  Wow.
[03:28:56.000 --> 03:28:58.000]  And I looked at my son and said, do you think I'm stupid?
[03:28:58.000 --> 03:28:59.000]  He goes, nope.
[03:28:59.000 --> 03:29:01.000]  Well done, Lord Vader.
[03:29:01.000 --> 03:29:03.000]  Don't hand pack me, bro.
[03:29:03.000 --> 03:29:04.000]  Don't hand pack me.
[03:29:04.000 --> 03:29:06.000]  And this is an old man hand packing,
[03:29:06.000 --> 03:29:08.000]  which is the worst type of hand packing because they think
[03:29:08.000 --> 03:29:09.000]  No, that's what they do.
[03:29:09.000 --> 03:29:11.000]  They all want power, but they want to do it in a cowardly way
[03:29:11.000 --> 03:29:12.000]  with the system.
[03:29:12.000 --> 03:29:13.000]  We're done.
[03:29:13.000 --> 03:29:16.000]  1776 worldwide, Phil.
[03:29:16.000 --> 03:29:20.000]  I'll park in your compact spot any time I feel like it.
[03:29:20.000 --> 03:29:22.000]  God, it's ridiculous.
[03:29:22.000 --> 03:29:24.000]  I think it's Miller's.
[03:29:24.000 --> 03:29:25.000]  Oh yeah.
[03:29:25.000 --> 03:29:26.000]  We still got another show to do.
[03:29:26.000 --> 03:29:28.000]  We're going to do one more show.
[03:29:28.000 --> 03:29:29.000]  All right.
[03:29:29.000 --> 03:29:31.000]  Remember that thing in the 70s and 80s?
[03:29:31.000 --> 03:29:33.000]  It's Miller's time.
[03:29:33.000 --> 03:29:36.000]  Didn't Bill Murray say that after on Ghostbusters?
[03:29:36.000 --> 03:29:37.000]  Yeah.
[03:29:37.000 --> 03:29:38.000]  It's Miller's time.
[03:29:38.000 --> 03:29:39.000]  Exactly.
[03:29:39.000 --> 03:29:40.000]  Jameson time.
[03:29:40.000 --> 03:29:41.000]  Oh my gosh.
[03:29:41.000 --> 03:29:44.000]  It's senior Rita time in your universe.
[03:29:44.000 --> 03:29:46.000]  Hey, Notly News tonight, 7.
[03:29:46.000 --> 03:29:47.000]  God bless you all.
[03:29:47.000 --> 03:29:48.000]  We love live.
[03:29:48.000 --> 03:29:49.000]  We're double now.
[03:29:49.000 --> 03:29:50.000]  We're on the march.
[03:29:50.000 --> 03:29:52.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:52.000 --> 03:30:02.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
