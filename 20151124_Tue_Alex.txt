[00:00.000 --> 00:14.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.200 --> 00:21.040]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.040 --> 00:30.600]  well I was up at 5 a.m. this morning trying to figure out exactly what's happening with the
[00:30.600 --> 00:37.000]  ongoing unraveling crisis that threatens World War four the Cold War was World War three ladies
[00:37.000 --> 00:43.720]  and gentlemen in and around Syria and I tell you Vladimir Putin's statement of events of what
[00:43.720 --> 00:50.080]  happened is very accurate Russian jets for a maximum of nine seconds may have been flying
[00:50.080 --> 00:59.600]  directly with GPS guidance on the border between Syria and Turkey Turkey has been injecting troops
[00:59.600 --> 01:09.160]  for almost five years paramilitaries al Qaeda forces into Syria Turkey is absolutely the bad
[01:09.160 --> 01:18.400]  guy in this and they have now with two USF 16's shot down the Russian fighter bomber and they've
[01:18.400 --> 01:27.000]  taken credit Turkish militias that came across the border with killing the pilots this could
[01:27.000 --> 01:31.360]  escalate into a World War three type situation World War four type situation very quickly here's
[01:31.360 --> 01:41.480]  Vladimir Putin breaking it down this is not this goes beyond the framework of the regular
[01:41.480 --> 01:51.480]  fight against terrorism certainly are military men are fighting terrorism sacrificing their own
[01:51.480 --> 02:06.520]  lives but today's last is related with the stamp in our back by the associates of tourism
[02:06.520 --> 02:15.800]  that has been given to us in our back by the accomplices of terrorists I cannot find another
[02:15.800 --> 02:24.640]  wording to what happened today our plane was shot down over the Syria over the Syrian territory
[02:24.640 --> 02:40.760]  the air-to-air missile came from F-16 Turkish were playing it fell on the territory of Syria
[02:40.760 --> 03:00.320]  four kilometers away from the Turkish border it was at an altitude of 6000 meters so one
[03:00.320 --> 03:12.440]  kilometer away from the Turkish border when it was hit in any case our pilots and our plane
[03:12.440 --> 03:25.480]  never threatened the Republic of Turkey in any way this was an obvious fact they conducted
[03:25.480 --> 03:41.080]  an operation to fight ISIS it was in northern Latakia that some maintenance part and that's
[03:41.080 --> 03:52.760]  where militants from Russia are located and in that case Russian pilots so to prevent
[03:52.760 --> 04:06.680]  the strikes against terrorists that could have come back to Russia at any moment and these
[04:06.680 --> 04:17.360]  were the people who are considered should be considered as international terrorists we
[04:17.360 --> 04:25.520]  have long identified that there are a lot of oil and petrol products going to Turkey from
[04:25.520 --> 04:31.160]  the captured territories oil and oil travels being transferred which were seized from the
[04:31.160 --> 04:38.560]  territory of Syria all right let's stop right there we're gonna come back with more of this
[04:38.560 --> 04:42.600]  in fact I may just back it up and play it again unprecedented statements we've been stabbed
[04:42.600 --> 04:47.640]  in the back by the associates of the terrorist Turkey's buying the al-qaeda oil it's all
[04:47.640 --> 04:56.400]  true and Turkey is there injecting brigades of terrorists in on a weekly basis and Russia
[04:56.400 --> 05:03.560]  bombs them global warming advocates are now blaming luxury condominiums for man-made climate
[05:03.560 --> 05:08.360]  change despite the record-breaking snowfall which recently pounded the northern US the
[05:08.360 --> 05:12.800]  climate words for all coalition released a report claiming that luxury apartment buildings
[05:12.800 --> 05:17.440]  are the largest climate change offenders in New York City these are New York City's largest
[05:17.440 --> 05:22.640]  buildings over 50,000 square feet in size which primarily consists of a mixture of luxury
[05:22.640 --> 05:27.320]  apartments commercial buildings and multi-family housing developments the report stated the
[05:27.320 --> 05:32.840]  report was released just as New York was being pounded by heavy snowstorms global warming
[05:32.840 --> 05:37.680]  advocates however will attempt to blame this record snowfall on man-made climate change
[05:37.680 --> 05:42.440]  even though a few years ago they were predicting that the earth's ice caps would have dramatically
[05:42.440 --> 05:46.640]  melted by now but they really want you to live in a tiny apartment so they can cram

[08:19.880 --> 08:29.560]  compare reality to the matrix the twilight zone the outer limits they live but i came
[08:29.560 --> 08:34.960]  in this morning and i was talking to nico some of the crew and i said can you believe
[08:34.960 --> 08:45.080]  this is really happening can you really believe our government nato the french the turkish
[08:45.080 --> 08:52.920]  government and others have been openly for five years ganging up on syria when syria
[08:52.920 --> 08:59.640]  did nothing to anybody killing close to 300,000 people conservatively mainly christians and
[08:59.640 --> 09:08.360]  non radical muslims and all these arab states and and and the stands and pakistan and afghanistan
[09:08.360 --> 09:15.560]  all the jihadis of the world the wahhabist jihadis descending to bully on the secular
[09:15.560 --> 09:22.760]  government and army blowing up police stations blowing up churches and our media calling
[09:22.760 --> 09:28.040]  them freedom fighters and saying how great it is anderson cooper that praised the overthrow
[09:28.040 --> 09:36.680]  of ukraine anderson cooper who praised the overthrow of the president of egypt four
[09:36.680 --> 09:43.720]  years ago who praised the overthrow of qaddafi so they could put al qaeda in place to mass
[09:43.720 --> 09:51.960]  murder and turkey more than anybody has been giving physical intelligence artillery support
[09:51.960 --> 10:01.880]  aircraft support the training camps for different fighting units from chechnya and pakistan
[10:01.880 --> 10:09.800]  more than 20 countries and they put them in brigades for combat training per country so
[10:09.800 --> 10:18.120]  they fight as units culturally and they send them in and putin was bombing on record chechens
[10:18.120 --> 10:27.720]  and others chechen training camps right on the border and with russian intelligence
[10:27.720 --> 10:34.600]  right as they're injecting their forces over the border to come in and to fight
[10:37.480 --> 10:45.560]  the anti al qaeda anti isis coalition turkey shot down the plane russia has released and
[10:45.560 --> 10:51.880]  we've got the maps upon info wars dot com their radar map showing them for nine seconds on the
[10:51.880 --> 11:06.200]  border on the border not over the border pentagon out of bagdad has released their trajectory
[11:06.200 --> 11:15.480]  topography maps showing it for maybe nine seconds a couple feet over the point is they had f16s on them
[11:15.480 --> 11:25.240]  made the united states trained by the united states and they fired two missiles into the
[11:27.640 --> 11:32.920]  how do i pronounce these sukoy 24 fighter bomber aircraft and then they shot they're
[11:32.920 --> 11:40.200]  not taking responsibility the pilots the bomber and the pilot as they drifted down on their parachutes
[11:40.200 --> 11:51.320]  another war crime so if somebody did this to our pilots we'd call them scum but the pentagon
[11:51.320 --> 11:56.040]  and our media and our controlled government is coming out defending all of this and it's truly
[11:56.840 --> 12:04.520]  sickening when you realize how militaristic turkey is turkey for large periods of time
[12:04.520 --> 12:09.080]  or ran the entire middle east before that it was the head of the roman empire the Byzantine empire
[12:09.080 --> 12:14.040]  so it's very imperial very militaristic and it's actually spoiling for a ground war with russia
[12:14.040 --> 12:17.480]  it's got a huge military and by the way the turkish army can fight
[12:21.240 --> 12:25.640]  but what it doesn't have is the moral high ground the government is on the verge of being toppled
[12:26.680 --> 12:33.800]  but i can't even explain to viewers and listeners historically how dangerous this is
[12:33.800 --> 12:39.800]  this is how a world war one or a world war two starts world war three was the cold war when you
[12:39.800 --> 12:46.760]  read the cia annals now top strategists are saying this could easily trigger world war four
[12:47.560 --> 12:51.800]  what we keep saying if somebody shoots down russian aircraft or if us aircraft gets shot
[12:51.800 --> 12:57.720]  shot down or if israeli aircraft gets shot down if somebody makes a mistake and now
[12:57.720 --> 13:05.560]  vladimir putin saying they will respond with serious action and will not tolerate this
[13:08.120 --> 13:14.600]  now turkey has bought on record eight hundred million dollars of oil just the last 12 months
[13:14.600 --> 13:26.600]  from isis alone turkey is literally sucking the money and the blood out of syria turkey's
[13:26.600 --> 13:34.360]  government and its military is an al-qaeda aiding and abetting group of pig-like murderers
[13:37.240 --> 13:44.440]  and vladimir putin has come out and said you are quote stabbing us in the back we have been stabbed
[13:44.440 --> 13:52.120]  in the back by the terrorist associates or translated the supporters of the terrorist
[13:52.120 --> 13:57.480]  and that is exactly what's going on and he went on to say you're buying the oil stolen turkey
[13:59.880 --> 14:04.280]  it doesn't matter who vladimir putin is whether he's a saint or a devil that doesn't matter
[14:04.280 --> 14:10.280]  the point is the west started this war it's in the wrong it's been committing war crimes
[14:10.280 --> 14:17.960]  hundreds of thousands dead and sky news the fox propaganda arm fox tv in this country and all the
[14:17.960 --> 14:28.360]  rest are putting these maps up and saying oh they came into turkish airspace for nine seconds
[14:29.000 --> 14:33.880]  you know what wasn't in turkish airspace we've got video of this we're going to play right now
[14:33.880 --> 14:38.120]  for tv viewers you're a radio listener in full wars dot com four slash show to add the added
[14:38.120 --> 14:49.240]  dimension of video we have a rescue helicopter marked with the universal sign of a medical
[14:49.240 --> 15:06.120]  helicopter the cross shot down as it came looking for the pilots and guess what they shot down the
[15:06.120 --> 15:13.720]  armored rescue helicopter they admit this in the associated press they set it up on video
[15:15.400 --> 15:23.480]  a united states anti tank tow missile which they've given them thousands of you know what
[15:23.480 --> 15:35.080]  else they've given them thousands thousands of service to air impads and there's the jihadis with
[15:35.080 --> 15:45.320]  us taxpayer paid for tow missile shooting down the russian helicopter this isn't the 1980s where
[15:45.320 --> 15:51.320]  the russians invade afghanistan after al qaeda type groups attack them and then you know we funded
[15:51.320 --> 15:55.800]  them with stinger missiles and oh they're our great muja hadin and then of course end up being
[15:55.800 --> 16:07.640]  supposedly involved in 9 11 this is now cut and dry al qaeda committing war crimes in 2012 1314 15
[16:10.040 --> 16:19.160]  blowing up a russian helicopter as it lands looking for the dead pilots and there they are
[16:19.160 --> 16:26.280]  in turkey over the border a couple miles away about to blow up the rescue helicopter where they
[16:26.280 --> 16:32.120]  leave out the dead pilots as bait boom you blew up the rescue helicopter great job you killed some
[16:32.120 --> 16:39.480]  more people aren't you just special we just showed that ladies and gentlemen here let's show them
[16:39.480 --> 16:45.800]  jumping around and dragging the dead bodies of the pilots for everybody the men fighting al qaeda
[16:45.800 --> 16:53.560]  fighting the people clearly involved that just killed 137 people in paris killing the people
[16:53.560 --> 16:59.960]  we're told we've got to bend over to a proctology exam at the tsa so we're safe but our borders
[16:59.960 --> 17:08.040]  are wide open and europe's borders are wide open so a bunch of miscreant scum could come in
[17:08.040 --> 17:16.840]  and do whatever they want this is truly over the top evil
[17:18.920 --> 17:24.200]  nato calls extraordinary meaning after turkey downs russian jet these are the headlines russian
[17:24.200 --> 17:34.200]  pilot is killed turkmen militias admit russia will not tolerate such crimes as a tax on the aircraft
[17:34.200 --> 17:43.400]  putin arranges as turkey shoots down russian plane putin downing of jet a stab in the back
[17:43.400 --> 17:47.880]  by those that aid the terrorists or the accomplices of terrorists depending on how you translate the
[17:47.880 --> 17:56.280]  russian but don't worry paris attacks for emergency edict basically martial law banning protest
[17:56.280 --> 18:01.960]  demonstrations free speech and intense policing in france new york times oh you let them in let
[18:01.960 --> 18:08.680]  them attack and then you arrest the conservative party leader lapin because she criticized it
[18:08.680 --> 18:12.440]  oh but the leftist can run around and burn things and beat police and they don't get in trouble
[18:13.640 --> 18:19.560]  this is how the terrorists operate the terrorist run france the terrorist run england the terrorist
[18:19.560 --> 18:25.160]  run the united states the terrorist run germany they do they're the ones shutting off our power
[18:25.160 --> 18:29.720]  plants they're the ones shipping our jobs overseas they're the ones messing with our five-year-olds
[18:29.720 --> 18:37.240]  messing with their gender identity we're under psychological war do you understand global warming
[18:37.240 --> 18:42.840]  taxes are a globalist military opt to turn the energy off how many years have i told you that
[18:42.840 --> 18:47.240]  what's putin come out two weeks ago and says this is a military operation against nation states and
[18:47.240 --> 18:55.400]  individuals to impoverish us this is a military weapons system that's exactly what it is but
[18:55.400 --> 19:00.760]  as the world wakes up that we're under globalist attack america's under globalist attack germany's
[19:00.760 --> 19:06.200]  under globalist attack russia's under globalist attack but russia for all its corruption doesn't
[19:06.200 --> 19:13.000]  want to commit suicide to the new world order at least their strong men kingpins over there
[19:13.000 --> 19:19.800]  want a prosperous country they're telling people to have kids they got billboards up saying russia's

[19:37.880 --> 19:44.120]  their kids' throats over and over again and say come to us al-qaeda take us over we are yours now

[24:19.880 --> 24:26.600]  so like a dog with the people that run our government that have hijacked it that have
[24:26.600 --> 24:33.640]  occupied it think we're so stupid and so distracted with the football coming up on thanksgiving
[24:33.640 --> 24:39.080]  and with the kardashians and with uh katelin Jenner
[24:42.680 --> 24:49.640]  that it's okay to gang up on a sovereign country for five years murder upwards of 300
[24:49.640 --> 24:56.760]  thousand people shoot down russian jets and say they deserve it this isn't the first aircraft
[24:56.760 --> 25:05.320]  that's been shot down right on the border and then have the turkish backed paramilitary
[25:05.320 --> 25:12.520]  with a us made high-tech tow missile blow up a rescue helicopter getting the dead bodies
[25:13.480 --> 25:20.600]  you notice that these pilots ejected several miles into syria
[25:20.600 --> 25:26.920]  up the aircraft was blown up on record over syria
[25:28.840 --> 25:36.760]  and turkish aircraft routinely come in and bomb syrian flagged military convoys
[25:39.960 --> 25:49.400]  turkey openly backsack isis and openly backs the takedown of Assad but our public is showy
[25:49.400 --> 25:55.720]  literate historically showy literate geopolitically showy literate about the middle east that i see
[25:55.720 --> 26:04.360]  news articles saying iran is behind isis here in the u.s the arch enemy of the wahhabist is the shiites
[26:05.240 --> 26:15.080]  this is the abject mindlessness this is so dangerous informed people barely know who the
[26:15.080 --> 26:20.840]  players are that i talked to so-called informed people this is crazy
[26:23.480 --> 26:27.240]  and this is a major provocation against the russians and the russians are saying
[26:27.240 --> 26:29.560]  there'll be serious consequences to turkey
[26:32.680 --> 26:37.080]  i wish america would get its soul back and wake up to this because it's shameful
[26:37.080 --> 26:46.360]  shameful to see this type of activity going on because i've studied the soviet union it did
[26:46.360 --> 26:53.400]  a lot of really nasty horrible stuff it was atheistic it was anti-family it was it was anti-christian
[26:55.160 --> 26:59.960]  but if you look at the mindsets and the foundations that set up the bolshevik revolution
[26:59.960 --> 27:08.200]  of 1917 with v.i. lennon it's the very same grandchildren and the very same people of that
[27:08.200 --> 27:17.640]  very brain trust that are running america today and you can't teach old dogs new tricks they're
[27:17.640 --> 27:26.520]  running the same nasty crap and it's so immoral it's all about raw evil power all about mackey of
[27:26.520 --> 27:38.280]  alien in justifies the means remember when he was on 60 minutes towards soros in 1999
[27:39.720 --> 27:45.320]  he was admitting he helped round people up and help find jews that were hiding and send them to
[27:45.320 --> 27:56.520]  do forced labor camps and he told the interviewer he said well i did what i had to do to survive
[27:57.160 --> 28:06.760]  so i'm not sorry that's a quote and i have no guilt he's not sorry he loves it
[28:09.320 --> 28:14.200]  and george soros then decided with the right wing nazis in ukraine to start a new war there
[28:14.200 --> 28:20.280]  on record that actually their leader hiles hitler the vice president that they put in was
[28:20.280 --> 28:31.240]  hiling hitler on tv but they went further than crazy nazi iconography they had like weird things
[28:31.240 --> 28:38.120]  with arian princesses valkyries shooting electricity out of their fingers that's what he would give
[28:38.120 --> 28:43.640]  speeches with that behind him women shooting lightning bolts out of their fingers some crazy
[28:43.640 --> 28:50.440]  weird nazi collaborator leftist jew funding people hiling hitler with electricity shooting out of
[28:50.440 --> 28:56.680]  their fingers this is the whacked out crazy town and our government saying russia deserve what it
[28:56.680 --> 29:03.000]  got and then there's video of them blowing up the rescue helicopter almost two miles inside syria
[29:04.680 --> 29:10.360]  this is what we've become this is who we are you say well we're not doing this well you know what
[29:10.360 --> 29:18.680]  we let these crazy crooks do it let's go out to break with putin again the quote about
[29:18.680 --> 29:21.880]  we were stabbed in the back by the accomplices of terrorists here it is
[29:24.360 --> 29:30.600]  this is not fine this goes beyond the framework of the regular fight against terrorism
[29:30.600 --> 29:40.120]  and certainly you are a military man fighting terrorism sacrificing their own lives
[29:44.520 --> 29:54.520]  but today's last is related with the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio
[29:54.520 --> 30:03.160]  network man made climate change is largely a myth promoted by politicians to scare the public into
[30:03.160 --> 30:07.320]  accepting a vast expansion of government to supposedly stop global warming global warming
[30:07.320 --> 30:11.080]  is a manufactured problem played up by the government to instigate a public reaction
[30:11.080 --> 30:15.880]  in this case fear the government then exploits to offer a predetermined solution the strategy now
[30:15.880 --> 30:20.280]  known as the hegelian dialectic has been used successfully by politicians for millennia to
[30:20.280 --> 30:24.360]  expand government which can only grow at the expense of individual liberties the bush administration
[30:24.360 --> 30:29.000]  used this strategy successfully in 2003 when it gained enough public support for the invasion of
[30:29.000 --> 30:33.160]  iraq a claiming country had weapons of mass destruction and the war ultimately expanded
[30:33.160 --> 30:37.480]  the military industrial complex in america's merging police state today global warming is
[30:37.480 --> 30:41.480]  used as a buggy man because it allows the un to use government funded scientists to scare the
[30:41.480 --> 30:45.560]  public into believing that man made climate change is too big of a threat for their country to handle
[30:45.560 --> 30:49.560]  alone and thus it's can only be defeated through the expansion of the un at the expense of their
[30:49.560 --> 30:53.640]  nation's sovereignty the number one goal of an out of control government is not to protect you but

[33:43.800 --> 33:49.480]  to get into science and tech immigration economy us news politics the big info or stack of just
[33:49.480 --> 33:55.240]  crazy tyranny political correctness black friday news special reports it's all jam packed but
[33:58.120 --> 34:03.640]  everyone can see now the world's going into design crisis anyone that's halfway paying attention
[34:03.640 --> 34:10.600]  can see that and i really again do not have words to describe how dangerous a situation it is
[34:12.360 --> 34:22.520]  to shoot down a russian aircraft that our media acts like we're in a coalition with against ices
[34:22.520 --> 34:28.840]  because russia forced our government to at least act like it was fighting ices by embarrassing turkey
[34:28.840 --> 34:34.040]  the united states and others and so that's what's happening here
[34:37.240 --> 34:42.280]  and as i said they think we're so dumb they think we're so ignorant they think we're so
[34:42.280 --> 34:48.200]  mindless that they can even have videos with the jihadis blowing up the rescue helicopter
[34:48.200 --> 34:58.040]  inside syria where they left the dead bodies of the pilot and bomber navigator who parachuted
[34:58.040 --> 35:11.960]  down but were shot another war crime and it just puts a cherry on top how evil the people are the
[35:11.960 --> 35:23.240]  control our governments and how wicked they are but the good news is our military is not ignorant
[35:23.240 --> 35:28.520]  about the players and is not ignorant about what's happening from the highest level officers right
[35:28.520 --> 35:35.000]  down to the enlisted people the military has been on fire for at least three years
[35:37.880 --> 35:45.320]  over the fact that we've been training and aiding actual bannered flagged al qaeda al nuzra now ices
[35:45.320 --> 35:52.040]  forces and the whole ices thing was a desperate gambit to confuse the military and and change the
[35:52.040 --> 35:56.360]  narrative off of the fact that our government was quarterbacking operations with al qaeda
[36:00.440 --> 36:03.960]  and i told you about the whistleblowers i told you about the military officers that were upset
[36:03.960 --> 36:09.560]  and then you saw them start going public you saw them speaking out you saw enlisted
[36:10.600 --> 36:15.880]  non commissioned commissioned officers and then you saw the former head of defense intelligence
[36:15.880 --> 36:20.840]  resigned three months ago he resigned like six months ago but two or three months ago he went
[36:20.840 --> 36:27.960]  public and said no we were ordered to back al qaeda ices this is all official
[36:32.840 --> 36:34.360]  and that's the equivalent
[36:39.880 --> 36:44.280]  of someone coming out and you know blowing the whistle on bill clinton selling missile secrets to
[36:44.280 --> 36:52.920]  china i mean it's a red-handed statement and it just comes out in the news the reporter interviewing
[36:52.920 --> 36:57.000]  the general just kind of changes the subject away from it but that's what's going on
[37:00.120 --> 37:04.760]  and it's over the top on so many points
[37:04.760 --> 37:15.800]  it's what type of elite would actually want to turn these countries from libya to syria
[37:16.600 --> 37:21.160]  over to wahhabi asad of saudi arabia well saudi arabia lobbies and has our government
[37:21.160 --> 37:23.640]  bought and paid for when it comes to middle east
[37:27.560 --> 37:32.760]  in fact here is the general the former head of defense intelligence on national television
[37:32.760 --> 37:37.960]  talking about here this at the sake of our viewers in 2012 your agency was saying quote
[37:37.960 --> 37:43.240]  the salafists the muslim brotherhood and al qaeda in iraq are the major forces driving the insurgents
[37:43.240 --> 37:49.400]  in syria in 2012 the us was helping coordinate arms transfers to those same groups why did you
[37:49.400 --> 37:54.120]  not stop that if you're worried about the rise of quote unquote i mean i hate to say it's not my
[37:54.120 --> 38:00.360]  job but that my job was to was to ensure that the that the accuracy of our intelligence that was
[38:00.360 --> 38:07.480]  being presented was was as good as it could be and i will tell you it goes before 2012 i mean
[38:07.480 --> 38:11.880]  when we're when we're in iraq and we still had decisions to be made before there was a decision
[38:11.880 --> 38:18.200]  to pull out of iraq in 2011 i mean it was very clear what we were what we were going to face well
[38:18.200 --> 38:22.120]  i admire your frank very clear what we were gonna let me let me just one before we move on just to
[38:22.120 --> 38:26.840]  clarify once more you are basically saying that even in government at the time you knew those
[38:26.840 --> 38:30.680]  groups were around you saw this analysis and you were arguing against it but who wasn't listening
[38:31.560 --> 38:36.360]  i think uh i think the administration the administration turned a blind eye to your
[38:36.360 --> 38:40.120]  analysis i don't know if they turned a blind eye i think it was a decision i think it was a willful
[38:40.120 --> 38:44.520]  decision a willful decision to go supported insurgency that had salafist al qaeda a willful
[38:44.520 --> 38:49.400]  decision to do what they're doing which which you have to really you have to really ask the
[38:49.400 --> 38:55.800]  president what is it that he actually is doing with the with the policy that is in place because
[38:55.800 --> 39:00.840]  it is very very confusing i'm sitting here today maddie and i don't i can't tell you exactly what
[39:00.840 --> 39:05.480]  that is and i've been at this for a long time okay well let's go back all right that's that's
[39:05.480 --> 39:10.280]  general michael flinn and he adds the caveat at the end that he can't figure it out well that's
[39:10.280 --> 39:16.040]  because you don't want to murder a couple hundred thousand christians general so you're you're you're
[39:16.040 --> 39:20.120]  you're not taking the final step you're like i don't get it it doesn't make sense why would you
[39:20.120 --> 39:27.480]  back al qaeda to do all this well what's the plan the plan is evil the plan is chaos the plan is bad
[39:29.240 --> 39:33.720]  that's what evil people do that's the plan it's like asking jeffrey dommer why'd you grab
[39:33.720 --> 39:39.400]  teenagers off the street and torture him to death because he wanted to or john wane gasey
[39:39.400 --> 39:42.840]  why'd you pick up young men off the street and torture him to death and bury him in your basement
[39:43.400 --> 39:46.920]  because that's what he did when he wasn't dressing up like a clown
[39:46.920 --> 39:53.640]  Lenin why'd you kill 20 million russians and others because that's what he wanted to do
[39:55.800 --> 40:00.600]  they'd send the nkvd and this is on record the russian annals that have been released
[40:00.600 --> 40:04.840]  and say okay we've killed half the town and no one's resisting as no one ever did he said i
[40:04.840 --> 40:09.080]  don't care more blood just kill more people right murder i want blood i want red terror
[40:09.080 --> 40:15.960]  and they'd say but sir no one's resisting and he'd say more blood
[40:18.760 --> 40:20.200]  there's a reason those flags are red
[40:23.080 --> 40:23.800]  and again
[40:27.160 --> 40:36.760]  bolshevik garbage is a new world order disease exported like a cancer cell into russia
[40:36.760 --> 40:40.040]  98 years ago
[40:46.600 --> 40:47.400]  truly sickening
[40:49.480 --> 40:52.040]  and now the same thing's going on here today i want to hear
[40:53.160 --> 40:58.520]  from active duty military not just in this country but any english speaking folks from europe russia i
[40:58.520 --> 41:03.320]  don't care united states what is your take on this am i overplaying how this could escalate into a
[41:03.320 --> 41:07.560]  bigger crisis or am i underplaying it or am i getting it just right or what would you add
[41:07.560 --> 41:24.680]  800 259 92 31 800 259 92 31 800 259 9231 and that's that's it military or contractors or
[41:24.680 --> 41:32.760]  people in the middle east that have witnessed this let me explain how it escalates you get a key area
[41:32.760 --> 41:38.760]  like syria that basically controls so much of the entire region because of its placement
[41:38.760 --> 41:47.240]  with all those countries around it lebanon israel jordan turkey iraq
[41:50.440 --> 41:51.640]  saudi arabia is close
[41:54.760 --> 41:59.000]  and they want to break that into different enclaves and then control the energy
[41:59.000 --> 42:03.880]  that comes out of iraq and then also comes out of the Mediterranean there it's a power grab
[42:07.240 --> 42:13.880]  and they're going to resettle syria with majority sunnis who are there on a pilgrimage
[42:13.880 --> 42:18.360]  of jihad their women and children come behind them and they move into people's houses with swimming
[42:18.360 --> 42:23.720]  pools they move into professor's houses police officers houses farmers houses hey this is a
[42:23.720 --> 42:31.960]  nice farm you syrian christians have had for 1800 years it's ours now and we don't like all these
[42:31.960 --> 42:37.080]  roman ruins here that are better than the ones in rome we're gonna blow them up because we're
[42:37.800 --> 42:47.320]  weirdo jerks we don't build structures that are there 2000 years plus later we blow them up
[42:47.320 --> 42:54.040]  up we shoot rescue helicopters on the ground and our media praises it
[42:59.240 --> 43:05.480]  and then it escalates and then the russians will undoubtedly do something now like bomb
[43:07.160 --> 43:11.320]  the russians know that they've got convoys of trucks and tanks armored vehicles delivering
[43:11.320 --> 43:20.040]  jihadis right through the turkish border into syria they know that all of that's going on
[43:21.000 --> 43:27.480]  that's the battlefront and so now when those turks step across the border one foot they're
[43:27.480 --> 43:31.480]  going to get blown up and you know what some bombs might actually go across the border now and hit
[43:31.480 --> 43:35.800]  some of those artillery emplacements oh or the guys that are a mile and a half across the tow
[43:35.800 --> 43:40.200]  missiles shooting helicopters and then if turkey wants to come attack well then the russians will
[43:40.200 --> 43:49.640]  attack and then all of a sudden you know what the russians said they do in 2008 in that whole
[43:49.640 --> 43:57.400]  situation that started unfolding in georgia they rolled medium range mobile missile launchers that
[43:57.400 --> 44:04.920]  had two plus thousand mile ranges in and said we're going to start nuking nato and us bases
[44:04.920 --> 44:10.600]  and then we're going to start hitting other european bases in one hour
[44:13.880 --> 44:18.120]  because the west attacked south osetia and abkhazia
[44:21.080 --> 44:23.880]  the demilitarized zone russian held since world war two
[44:27.720 --> 44:33.720]  fought over with hitler they roll in at five in the morning and just attack and just slaughter
[44:33.720 --> 44:39.480]  all the un and russian troops and then our media goes on air and says russia has attacked
[44:43.240 --> 44:50.440]  georgia a lot of americans thought they meant on the east coast in the south no georgia south of
[44:50.440 --> 44:57.640]  russia the original georgia not the one with the peaches and i even bought it for about an hour
[44:57.640 --> 45:02.360]  i was watching cnn i got the word russia attacked georgia i didn't even know you're back then that
[45:02.360 --> 45:07.000]  state lie that bad i mean i that was just such a bold face lie and then i was sort of reading
[45:07.000 --> 45:10.920]  foreign press and seeing it was like no the russians rolled troops in after the attack
[45:11.560 --> 45:15.480]  and then all they're doing is kicking them out of south osetia and abkhazia and saying if they
[45:15.480 --> 45:21.160]  pull back they won't go further into georgia and then nato troop plane started landing
[45:24.840 --> 45:29.800]  and so russia rolled missiles in and so that's how fast this can happen
[45:29.800 --> 45:34.520]  dick cheney who was really the president of the time he blinked and backed off
[45:40.520 --> 45:46.040]  so that's where all this is going and look cablin jenner won't even though he's she's
[45:48.200 --> 45:53.960]  daring brave beautiful incredible deserves a nobel peace prize
[45:53.960 --> 45:58.920]  deserves miss america award even though it looks like a snapping turtle with a wig on
[46:01.400 --> 46:08.120]  that won't protect us as a bubble of protection all the trendies wearing different color socks and
[46:08.120 --> 46:15.720]  things that won't protect us in a nuclear war we just can't live over here in a bubble
[46:16.280 --> 46:20.520]  where our degenerate government and criminals that run it run around murdering everybody
[46:20.520 --> 46:28.440]  this will end up coming back on us at some point and then to watch haland and
[46:28.440 --> 46:34.840]  merkel and obama grandstand about security threats and troops on the streets and suspension of
[46:34.840 --> 46:41.400]  free speech in europe and big to protect us from the jihadis that they open the borders up
[46:41.400 --> 46:52.680]  they advertise the freebies they brought them in that's pretty amazing isn't it
[46:54.520 --> 46:57.320]  that's pretty darn incredible isn't it
[47:04.440 --> 47:08.920]  you can see it they want to bring down civilization they want to bring down
[47:08.920 --> 47:12.280]  individualism they want to bring down our families we are under attack we're going to
[47:12.280 --> 47:20.440]  go to break and come back to randon who's a marine john whose army randy's navy john and
[47:20.440 --> 47:25.160]  isle was also army we'll go to all of you and there's no guests next hour and i'll get to all of

[47:33.960 --> 47:38.840]  every time it has all the makings and it's not just me saying that it's every major historian
[47:38.840 --> 47:45.880]  academic researcher from russia to england to the united states from brazil to china from
[47:45.880 --> 47:54.920]  japan to south africa the world is lining up for war and america hadn't been perfect in its history
[47:54.920 --> 48:00.280]  but it would never i've studied all our major wars been involved on the side of not having
[48:00.280 --> 48:09.000]  moral authority at least the appearance of the moral authority at least we truly are having our
[48:09.000 --> 48:14.280]  moral authority destroyed right now we're having our name destroyed by the more educated world on
[48:14.280 --> 48:22.200]  what's happening while we're in our little bubble and it's a crime against all our ancestors it's
[48:22.200 --> 48:27.880]  truly shameful so i'm here to tell you not in my name i'm standing up as a real american as a christian

[54:46.600 --> 54:56.920]  precaution that's what russia's saying but here is the quote from the turkish president
[54:57.640 --> 55:01.480]  everyone should know we would make every sacrifice to take every precaution
[55:01.480 --> 55:05.320]  when our country is surrounded by a circle of flames that you've helped quarterback and run
[55:05.320 --> 55:11.720]  and the safety of our borders and the lives of our citizens at risk the reaction of the turkish
[55:11.720 --> 55:18.120]  armed forces to jets violating turkish airspace should be evaluated from this point of view
[55:18.120 --> 55:23.960]  we do not have eyes on any particular country's territories everybody should be aware that it's
[55:23.960 --> 55:29.640]  our intentional international right and national duty to do whatever is necessary to take every
[55:29.640 --> 55:34.280]  measure against whoever violates our airspace our land borders despite the fact that we have
[55:34.280 --> 55:39.240]  issued many warnings and have emphasized our engagement rules during the security summit we
[55:39.240 --> 55:47.000]  held last sunday you mean when your forces have tow missiles blowing up rescue helicopters a mile
[55:47.000 --> 55:51.720]  and a half inside syria is that what you mean or when you're buying the stolen oil you piece of filth
[55:51.720 --> 56:02.200]  ganging up on syria so you can murder all the christians you anti christian maggot
[56:07.320 --> 56:09.320]  that's the turkish prime minister i was saying president
[56:10.600 --> 56:15.880]  but just it's just sickening how dumb they think we are all right let me see who's been holding
[56:15.880 --> 56:22.520]  longest who's the only longest john and iowa or john and mass or john and texas they're all army
[56:24.440 --> 56:30.200]  john and mass am i wrong about this or is it just crazy to watch all these countries ganged up on
[56:30.200 --> 56:36.440]  syria russia is trying to defeat al qaeda and then now the media is like how great it is look the
[56:36.440 --> 56:41.160]  jihadis are blowing up rescue helicopters i mean is this not villainous or am i wrong
[56:41.160 --> 56:46.760]  well alex i'm gonna tell you the truth i'm calling in for my friend john is on the service
[56:46.760 --> 56:53.640]  because uh he's kind of a victim of the chilling effect we had a real long talk and um he said
[56:53.640 --> 57:01.320]  basically him and his you know his buddies in the military uh are very aware that what technology
[57:01.320 --> 57:07.560]  is now driving the timing for the clash of civilizations and they feel that if they don't
[57:07.560 --> 57:14.760]  act soon enough um that people are gonna wake up so they've got to use technology now before it
[57:14.760 --> 57:22.600]  turns on them and it's kind of a panic mode it's that they he said it's chaos um nothing makes sense
[57:23.240 --> 57:29.320]  morale is plummeting in the military him and his buddies absolutely know what's going on they go home
[57:29.320 --> 57:35.160]  and they go on the internet and they find out you know look at both sides and i mean i got i
[57:35.160 --> 57:40.280]  asked him like how many people are awake how many people are awake and and he's like all of them
[57:40.280 --> 57:45.080]  except for the people that came in dumb as a rock but everybody that's got any kind of common sense
[57:45.800 --> 57:51.640]  they get it and it's killing morale but you know it gives me a little heart because i just don't
[57:51.640 --> 57:56.040]  think they'll be part of it but see but you're right the globalist above them are running out
[57:56.040 --> 58:01.000]  of time because they need to get rid of humans first and have autonomous combat systems land
[58:01.000 --> 58:06.840]  sea and air and undersea before they collapse the military with trannies and red high heels as the
[58:06.840 --> 58:12.920]  commandos i mean you want to kill morale spree to core that's how you do it but but so so they're
[58:12.920 --> 58:18.360]  ahead of schedule ruling them ruling the military but behind schedule rolling out the autonomous
[58:19.000 --> 58:26.120]  systems and so it is the end of humanity the end of chivalry the end of the soldiers and the
[58:26.120 --> 58:30.760]  technocrats now get to play god and send out their robot armies but right now they're using
[58:30.760 --> 58:36.440]  proxy armies to attack their enemies sovereign nations and christians we'll be back with more

[1:00:40.920 --> 1:00:45.000]  criminal occupied government all these other western governments following this globalist
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:51.080]  agenda to gang up on sovereign nations and kill every christian they can find it shows us
[1:00:52.040 --> 1:00:56.120]  that it's not just about conquering people it's about actually hurting good people
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:01:02.920]  it's a very evil agenda we're taking calls from former or current military or people in the region
[1:01:02.920 --> 1:01:13.000]  contractors you name it russian aircraft shot down for flying on the border of turkey and then
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:20.680]  the jihadis sit there with a tow missile us made and destroy a russian rescue helicopter a mile and
[1:01:20.680 --> 1:01:27.160]  half away in syria and they've met that themselves russian rescue helicopters shot down by syrian
[1:01:27.160 --> 1:01:32.120]  rebels while searching for pilots the plane down by turkey well yeah they put the bodies out for them
[1:01:32.120 --> 1:01:37.560]  and then waited for the helicopter to come and again the plane was shot down over syria

[1:01:58.280 --> 1:02:05.080]  in last week about the urban warfare drills and i wanted to talk of tell you that uh so a lot of
[1:02:05.080 --> 1:02:09.880]  my friends that are still in the military they're totally freaked out by all this because the u.s
[1:02:09.880 --> 1:02:13.880]  military has been stripped down so much if we get into a war with russia we're not going to have
[1:02:14.440 --> 1:02:20.040]  the manpower to be able to fight the russians because obama stripped us our military so
[1:02:20.040 --> 1:02:27.240]  significantly and a lot of people in in all branches think it's great that we're going to war
[1:02:27.240 --> 1:02:31.640]  with the russians and think that because the jihadis are fighting the russians now the jihadis
[1:02:31.640 --> 1:02:37.240]  somehow you know redeemed of all the evils that they're guilty of it's insane are you joking
[1:02:38.520 --> 1:02:43.000]  now i'm serious i have friends i have friends that i served with in the marine corps who say
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:48.200]  you need to shut up about this and stop talking that about us it's like look buddy i'm just talking
[1:02:48.200 --> 1:02:55.800]  about the truth all the injustices of the iraq war in the afghan war iraq did nothing to us we went
[1:02:55.800 --> 1:03:00.840]  in there god only knows how many innocent men women and children were slaughtered because
[1:03:01.960 --> 1:03:07.880]  i mean it's just ridiculous like i know marine corps officers say look you need to shut up about
[1:03:07.880 --> 1:03:13.560]  this because i know to georgetown and i say and i talk about quite often all the evils that the
[1:03:13.560 --> 1:03:18.520]  u.s army and marine corps have been a part of in iraq and i've gotten calls saying hey look you need
[1:03:18.520 --> 1:03:27.560]  to shut up about this okay and um i noticed um you guys put up the video of my call and people were
[1:03:27.560 --> 1:03:33.880]  saying how do we know this guy's a former marine because i said i was an x marine and i call myself
[1:03:33.880 --> 1:03:39.480]  an x marine because i really regret ever joining the marine corps well sir when you called in and
[1:03:39.480 --> 1:03:45.320]  we put everything up on youtube um we don't need you to confirm that they're training an urban warfare
[1:03:45.320 --> 1:03:49.880]  to take on patriots in the tea party that's in all the declassified documents i personally have
[1:03:49.880 --> 1:03:55.240]  shot video of it myself uh so it doesn't matter people will always deny whatever i appreciate your
[1:03:55.240 --> 1:04:00.760]  call um i mean they'll deny that seattle is telling folks that they can't have brown bags
[1:04:02.120 --> 1:04:06.120]  they'll deny that they're trying to ban the term mother or father even though it's happening
[1:04:06.120 --> 1:04:12.440]  they'll deny that they've banned dodgeball for 15 years or tag they'll deny that you know obama
[1:04:12.440 --> 1:04:19.320]  ever said you could keep your doctor i mean that's just what they do as a default to not have an
[1:04:19.320 --> 1:04:24.040]  intellectual discussion about how they're getting armored m wraps for the tea party and returning
[1:04:24.040 --> 1:04:29.240]  veterans it's in the documents it's in the training manuals and we have the swat team commanders
[1:04:30.760 --> 1:04:36.840]  from spokane washington to indianapolis indiana saying it's for the patriots and the coming war
[1:04:36.840 --> 1:04:42.600]  with us and i got the army times admitting it and all the rest of it so uh when somebody like you
[1:04:42.600 --> 1:04:46.920]  calls in if i don't think you're telling the truth about something i'll jump on because we already
[1:04:46.920 --> 1:04:51.880]  know what's going on uh we're going to go to other calls straight ahead on the other side of this
[1:04:51.880 --> 1:05:02.040]  break this is a big deal happening over in syria the dc police chief urges citizens to fight back
[1:05:02.040 --> 1:05:08.440]  against peristyle attackers speaking with 60 minutes on sunday washington dc police chief
[1:05:08.440 --> 1:05:14.360]  kathy leneer urged residents to do what's necessary to save lives in the event of a terror attack or
[1:05:14.360 --> 1:05:20.360]  mass shooting whether it means run hide or fight if you're in a position to try to take the gunmen
[1:05:20.360 --> 1:05:25.800]  out it's the best option for saving lives before police can get there leneer said while acknowledging
[1:05:25.800 --> 1:05:31.080]  her latest suggestion was counterintuitive to previous tactics the police have advised leneer
[1:05:31.080 --> 1:05:35.720]  claim that taking action may be essential to prevent another massacre like the attack in
[1:05:35.720 --> 1:05:42.520]  paris which left over 120 people dead we always tell people don't take action call 911 don't
[1:05:42.520 --> 1:05:49.160]  intervene in the robbery leneer said we've never told people take action but it's a different scenario

[1:08:10.360 --> 1:08:20.040]  radio network if you just joined us in the second hour it is already ladies and gentlemen
[1:08:20.040 --> 1:08:26.760]  almost thanksgiving hard to believe it is the 24th day on this tuesday worldwide broadcast
[1:08:28.840 --> 1:08:37.240]  2015 is almost over and a russian fighter bomber was shot down flying close to the border
[1:08:37.240 --> 1:08:43.960]  flying on the border for some of the time and then crashed about a mile and a half inside syria
[1:08:45.880 --> 1:08:50.840]  then the jihadis from the turkish side with a tow missile us made on record blew up the rescue
[1:08:50.840 --> 1:08:59.880]  helicopter another war crime the russians say they're going to have a very serious response
[1:08:59.880 --> 1:09:08.200]  to the turks the turks have bought at least 800 million dollars of stolen al-qaeda oil
[1:09:08.200 --> 1:09:14.680]  that was stolen from the syrians the turks have been heavily involved trying to take over syria
[1:09:14.680 --> 1:09:20.760]  the entire five years it's truly shameful and then our media sits there and acts like we're
[1:09:20.760 --> 1:09:25.160]  fighting ices that's why when obama was finally forced to bomb a few oil tankers
[1:09:25.160 --> 1:09:31.800]  they gave him a 45 minute warning our story was on drudgereport.com yesterday so we're taking your
[1:09:31.800 --> 1:09:36.280]  phone calls on this subject until the bottom of the hour don't continue with calls i'm gonna shift
[1:09:36.280 --> 1:09:43.480]  gears into some other news we haven't gotten to some black friday reports and more but this could
[1:09:43.480 --> 1:09:51.800]  very easily escalate into a larger war between nato and russia and that's mainstream news saying that
[1:09:51.800 --> 1:09:58.120]  then i watch haland the president of france i watched the chancellor of germany merkel
[1:09:59.320 --> 1:10:04.040]  and others grandstanding about oh we have a civil emergency no demonstrations
[1:10:05.880 --> 1:10:12.040]  no free speech but the borders stay wide open and we're protecting you from terrorist the very
[1:10:12.040 --> 1:10:22.920]  people who brought them in truly sickening on every front and this just shows us who runs our
[1:10:22.920 --> 1:10:29.080]  country and who runs europe these are really nasty bad people and our governments are allied
[1:10:29.800 --> 1:10:38.600]  with the so-called royal family a bunch of caravan robbing bandits
[1:10:38.600 --> 1:10:46.040]  who then just run around murdering all over the world and then we never really fight them
[1:10:47.640 --> 1:10:54.680]  we go attack a country like iraq that was fighting them and blame them for 911
[1:10:58.600 --> 1:11:02.120]  so i want to hear from military folks i want to hear from pilots i want to hear from analysts
[1:11:02.120 --> 1:11:05.560]  i want to hear from people that have lived in turkey or syria where do you think all this is
[1:11:05.560 --> 1:11:10.200]  going is it as bad as i'm saying i think it is you think i'm wrong what can you add we've got
[1:11:10.200 --> 1:11:14.920]  maverick he says he worked on cultural project in turkey but he just called him we'll get to him
[1:11:14.920 --> 1:11:20.440]  john was army in texas wants to comment randy in texas former navy john and i was army we're
[1:11:20.440 --> 1:11:26.200]  going to go to the john's first and we're going to maverick and randy uh john in texas this is
[1:11:26.200 --> 1:11:32.920]  escalating just as we warned it could now i hope the next phase of escalation uh doesn't happen
[1:11:32.920 --> 1:11:39.080]  uh what do you think obama and the globalist are thinking right now well alex what i'm afraid
[1:11:39.080 --> 1:11:44.200]  is going to happen over this because we're going to have a major war breakout they're going to say
[1:11:44.200 --> 1:11:48.840]  well gee we can't go nuclear it'll destroy the whole world let's let's fight this conventionally
[1:11:48.840 --> 1:11:55.480]  like we did in korea and vietnam we'll have a war it drags on for how many years and you remember
[1:11:55.480 --> 1:12:00.600]  in world war one and world war two basically we were in a dictatorship here we had food rationing
[1:12:00.600 --> 1:12:06.680]  travel restrictions uh gas rationing anybody criticized the war was thrown into jail uh
[1:12:08.040 --> 1:12:13.640]  that's what i'm afraid is going to happen out of this you're right sir you said it i said it
[1:12:14.680 --> 1:12:19.960]  this is it and what you just said is the answer to everything they have already declared civil
[1:12:19.960 --> 1:12:25.480]  emergency in germany and france and in belgium other countries are following suit they're
[1:12:25.480 --> 1:12:33.880]  restricting nighttime curfews papers please no demonstrations they have an emergency edict in
[1:12:33.880 --> 1:12:39.480]  place their socialist president is using this to seize control because people can't say two plus
[1:12:39.480 --> 1:12:45.160]  two equals four they're saying it says whatever the tyrant says haland and others are the ones
[1:12:45.160 --> 1:12:49.240]  that offered the freebies they brought in the radicals they allowed them to attack
[1:12:49.240 --> 1:12:59.640]  and they are now doing this to bring in a wartime atmosphere where they the actual culprits the actual
[1:12:59.640 --> 1:13:08.520]  mafia dogs of our present crisis are now our savers please continue well i think that that's
[1:13:08.520 --> 1:13:12.360]  what's going to happen i mean if we have a major war how long is it going to drag on for i'm how
[1:13:12.360 --> 1:13:17.480]  long do world war one world war two drag on for and they had major huge war i mean they had the
[1:13:17.480 --> 1:13:21.960]  valet were done were billion killed in all these major major battles i mean are we
[1:13:21.960 --> 1:13:26.920]  prepared to take the casualties like they had in world war one and two where you know maybe
[1:13:26.920 --> 1:13:34.040]  every one battle 50 100 000 people die in one battle you know well absolutely and i made the
[1:13:34.040 --> 1:13:37.560]  comment even though both my grandfathers were in world war two that the united states basically
[1:13:37.560 --> 1:13:43.400]  supplied munitions and weapons to russia we we lost 400 500 000 people in world war two
[1:13:43.400 --> 1:13:52.520]  the bread's over 100 000 but the russians lost 20 plus 20 21 million the the germans lost 20
[1:13:52.520 --> 1:14:00.200]  plus million people germany was only like 70 million people and when they were done they were
[1:14:00.200 --> 1:14:06.920]  50 million or less i mean this isn't a game it isn't a joke and you're absolutely right
[1:14:06.920 --> 1:14:15.560]  uh the russians fought really about 90 percent of world war two and they lost a large portion
[1:14:15.560 --> 1:14:23.320]  of their population and now uh you could say stalin was just as bad as hitler in my view historically
[1:14:24.360 --> 1:14:26.760]  there really is no lesser two evils but now russia
[1:14:29.320 --> 1:14:33.320]  is not the bad guy you have to look at the west and say we really are the villains this time
[1:14:33.320 --> 1:14:38.760]  and believe me the villains right in our countries are setting up a police state and saying from the
[1:14:38.760 --> 1:14:47.240]  rooftops it's for quote returning veterans gun owners conservatives libertarians christians
[1:14:48.440 --> 1:14:53.720]  because when they do all this wartime stuff and start arresting people they know vets are some
[1:14:53.720 --> 1:15:00.360]  of the only groups that might fight back and so yes they want to have a socialist collectivist
[1:15:00.360 --> 1:15:07.320]  uprising to overthrow the local cities to put their local commissariats in control and then dictate
[1:15:10.440 --> 1:15:17.320]  through their apparatchiks the commissar system of political persecution i mean we are going to
[1:15:17.320 --> 1:15:23.400]  have a basically a soviet style occupation run on us and then that's come out in the fbi files
[1:15:23.400 --> 1:15:27.720]  that's what we know from the weathermen that's really the plan in the new army manuals i can't
[1:15:27.720 --> 1:15:32.840]  believe i'm saying this but it's all true they say reeducation camp for the patriots
[1:15:34.600 --> 1:15:38.360]  and it won't matter where the good guys it won't matter where the hard work in america today
[1:15:38.360 --> 1:15:45.880]  that's why they hate us it's the socialist it's the collectivist all run by the george soros types
[1:15:48.600 --> 1:15:53.160]  who are you know telling matt drudge to the grapevine through the supreme court justice that

[1:17:56.040 --> 1:18:01.240]  said matt it's over for you they've got the votes now to enforce copyright law you're out of there
[1:18:01.240 --> 1:18:06.200]  they're going to make it so headlines you can't even use headlines to have a supreme court justice
[1:18:06.200 --> 1:18:13.560]  say that to my face that it's over they've got the votes which means time is limited time is not

[1:18:38.360 --> 1:18:43.800]  massive traffic to them they're claiming you're taking their words this is insane and you had
[1:18:43.800 --> 1:18:48.440]  the justice steven bryer said we need to look at a global law now member just recently getting

[1:18:52.920 --> 1:18:57.400]  was shocking you thought some of these other decisions were shocking wait until these copyright
[1:18:57.400 --> 1:19:04.280]  laws work their way up and the supreme court decides you cannot have a website with news
[1:19:04.280 --> 1:19:11.720]  headlines linking across the board uh the full 45 minute interview we're gonna re-air that i think
[1:19:11.720 --> 1:19:19.800]  on thanksgiving but it's a very very important interview and people just need to understand

[1:24:54.200 --> 1:25:06.280]  that in your head this world is ruled by violence but i guess that's better than i said bob billon
[1:25:06.280 --> 1:25:11.880]  said you got to serve somebody and then he said you got to sell off the devil and he said he sold
[1:25:11.880 --> 1:25:19.160]  out the god of this world from broadway to the milky way that's a lot of real estate indeed
[1:25:19.960 --> 1:25:27.160]  and a man's gonna do what a man's gotta do was i just demonizing bob billon no i think that's
[1:25:27.160 --> 1:25:34.200]  pretty hardcore of the stuff he said pretty twisted too or was he just trying to get people thinking
[1:25:34.200 --> 1:25:40.440]  it'd be easy to write those lyrics today but pretty hard back in i think 1982
[1:25:43.080 --> 1:25:48.360]  yeah we used to grow corn in kansas now we grow it on the moon and eat it raw
[1:25:50.680 --> 1:25:54.280]  i want to go back to your phone calls right into the next segment if you just joined us

[1:26:06.600 --> 1:26:11.000]  put the dead bodies out for them to land and blew up the rescue helicopter
[1:26:13.240 --> 1:26:18.040]  and that's the type of people we back the jihadis that literally murder every christian they can
[1:26:18.040 --> 1:26:24.680]  get their hands on with a suspension of reality going on then it's not a news issue that why are
[1:26:24.680 --> 1:26:29.960]  we backing these people why are our borders open why are we bringing them here these are the so-called
[1:26:29.960 --> 1:26:35.320]  syrian refugees that turkey lets in they don't let christians in that's why you'll have thousands
[1:26:35.320 --> 1:26:41.160]  of jihadis thousands of wahhabist and they'll have one christian that was the headline no 2000
[1:26:41.160 --> 1:26:50.440]  something muslims one christian and then obama gets up on the news and says well we can't just
[1:26:50.440 --> 1:26:54.840]  take christians that's not what this is about refugees really you take who's being persecuted
[1:26:54.840 --> 1:27:01.880]  jackass that's what political asylum is and you know that full well it takes real pleasure not
[1:27:01.880 --> 1:27:06.360]  letting the christians in is there any christian obama ever found he didn't want to slip their
[1:27:06.360 --> 1:27:11.320]  throat and cut their head off if he could i'm serious i've seen it they hate christians
[1:27:12.840 --> 1:27:18.520]  he'll get those bitter clingers he'll send in his jihadis he'll cut daddy's head off rape mama and
[1:27:18.520 --> 1:27:26.440]  the girls before they kill him and he'll get a peace prize and glorious dynamo drop by john and i

[1:27:37.960 --> 1:27:45.240]  is absolutely unbelievable and what i foresee happening with this situation in turkey is um
[1:27:45.240 --> 1:27:49.640]  you know what's going to happen with this is this is a furtherance to get a russia into a
[1:27:49.640 --> 1:27:57.320]  full out full-fledged full-blown war with the nato alliances and if this actually happens what i
[1:27:57.320 --> 1:28:02.360]  foresee happening is russia is going to be fighting a two-front fight not only in the middle east but
[1:28:02.360 --> 1:28:07.400]  over on the western border of russia itself in ukraine they're already fighting a two proxy war
[1:28:07.400 --> 1:28:12.120]  right now you're saying it's going to escalate absolutely without a doubt it's going to escalate
[1:28:12.120 --> 1:28:17.880]  to the point of um thermal thermal nuclear war or thermal barrack nuclear war and you know i mean
[1:28:17.880 --> 1:28:23.160]  this is just absolutely i mean frightening to say the least i mean you know as well as i do
[1:28:23.160 --> 1:28:27.800]  everybody here in the united states does not want to be involved in any war we don't want to go fight
[1:28:27.800 --> 1:28:32.760]  we don't want to have anything to do with this but now they are literally pushing us and pushing
[1:28:32.760 --> 1:28:38.600]  and pushing and pushing until we are going to be involved and you know i don't know i mean it is
[1:28:38.600 --> 1:28:43.960]  out of control you know i've got a radio show i do every sunday on my own program and i talk about
[1:28:43.960 --> 1:28:48.120]  this and i called this three weeks three months ago just as much as you did i said you know what's
[1:28:48.120 --> 1:28:55.080]  going to happen is there's going to be a situation where soldiers on the ground get bombed like let's
[1:28:55.080 --> 1:28:59.080]  say how they were they were wanting to put our soldiers there to be body shields for the sissis
[1:28:59.080 --> 1:29:04.040]  of the desert the isis and you know it was either going to be something like that or a jet's going
[1:29:04.040 --> 1:29:09.160]  to be down well now a jet has been down and this is the tent this is the match being thrown into
[1:29:09.160 --> 1:29:14.680]  the tender box to literally blew up the russian jetliner to stir them up i mean they're i mean
[1:29:14.680 --> 1:29:19.480]  russia's not stupid they play chess they know they're trying to sucker them into a larger war
[1:29:20.440 --> 1:29:24.920]  stay there i want to come back to you john's army i want to hear about your radio show let's plug
[1:29:24.920 --> 1:29:31.160]  that uh again folks i'm not about competition i want i want a hundred people better than i am out
[1:29:31.160 --> 1:29:34.040]  there i'm looking for them believe me if i find them i'm going to try to hire them and they can take
[1:29:34.040 --> 1:29:39.720]  over uh this is a fight folks this is a war we need soldiers in the fight people that get it
[1:29:39.720 --> 1:29:44.120]  and it's surreal though to watch everybody else talking about Thanksgiving just wandering around

[1:30:30.600 --> 1:30:36.040]  heavy snowstorms global warming advocates however will attempt to blame this record snowfall on
[1:30:36.040 --> 1:30:41.560]  man-made climate change even though a few years ago they were predicting that the earth's ice caps
[1:30:41.560 --> 1:30:46.280]  would have dramatically melted by now but they really want you to live in a tiny apartment so they

[1:33:35.640 --> 1:33:45.080]  and certainly you are a military man fighting terrorism sacrificing their own lives
[1:33:49.560 --> 1:33:59.640]  but today's last is related with the stab in our back by the associates of tourism
[1:33:59.640 --> 1:34:09.080]  that has been given to us in our back by the accomplices of terrorists i cannot find another
[1:34:09.080 --> 1:34:17.320]  wording to what happened today he goes on to say turkey is getting the oil that isis is stealing
[1:34:17.320 --> 1:34:22.040]  that's on record and they're aiding in a betting terrorist so the good news is
[1:34:22.680 --> 1:34:27.320]  putin and russia's so high profile it's all coming out now former head of defense intelligence
[1:34:27.320 --> 1:34:31.880]  as we played last hour said no we're ordered to aid al-qaeda this is all on purpose joss urnis
[1:34:31.880 --> 1:34:37.880]  back in october said that russia's playing checkers not chess no what we're doing is losing our
[1:34:37.880 --> 1:34:43.400]  moral authority and doing really evil war crimes against muslim minorities and christians against
[1:34:43.400 --> 1:34:49.880]  a sovereign country that has a defense treaty with russia that we attacked and that john mccain
[1:34:49.880 --> 1:34:56.680]  has been photographed with the leaders of isis and al-qaeda two years ago hanging out inside
[1:34:56.680 --> 1:35:05.400]  syria it's incredible and it shows the arrogance of these people in fact let's play a clip of josh
[1:35:05.400 --> 1:35:11.320]  urnis uh making that statement no no what we're doing is being sucked into pure evil what russia
[1:35:11.320 --> 1:35:18.360]  is doing is the moral right obligation defending a country under attack by murderous scum on the
[1:35:18.360 --> 1:35:23.800]  military to military talks i would not rule out that there are our follow-ups uh relatively soon
[1:35:23.800 --> 1:35:29.800]  to those um initial conversations that took place last week but i think there is one premise of your
[1:35:29.800 --> 1:35:36.200]  question that i would uh disagree with i don't think president putin is playing chess he's playing
[1:35:36.200 --> 1:35:44.280]  checkers uh and i say that because he's making a series of tactical decisions that are leading to a
[1:35:45.240 --> 1:35:51.160]  starkly negative strategic conclusion i'll stop right there which is that by making this is this
[1:35:51.160 --> 1:35:57.720]  moral authority garbage where we're the west we'll do whatever we want and so we'll just do horribly
[1:35:58.360 --> 1:36:03.800]  amoral things inside with horrible people and because we're going to win that makes it morally
[1:36:03.800 --> 1:36:09.960]  okay well you're not going to win and look i don't romanticize the military but at least
[1:36:09.960 --> 1:36:16.040]  historically kings had to go out and fight uh royal families sent their kids the front lines
[1:36:16.040 --> 1:36:20.200]  because the troops wouldn't fight if you didn't do that if you didn't have skin in the game and the
[1:36:20.200 --> 1:36:26.600]  last 50 years or so we've gone from every president we had basically being a military veteran except
[1:36:26.600 --> 1:36:35.400]  for abraham lincoln maybe and a few others to people that have no conception of how of history
[1:36:35.400 --> 1:36:42.920]  even or what happens and so it is our military as corrupt as it is as bad as it is that's
[1:36:42.920 --> 1:36:50.040]  actually been saying we shouldn't be doing this this isn't good to back al qaeda and that's why
[1:36:50.040 --> 1:36:54.200]  we know about this is because they've been speaking about it and i've been speaking about it as well
[1:36:54.200 --> 1:36:59.560]  obviously that's why we're such big enemies uh they're at the white house and why they constantly
[1:36:59.560 --> 1:37:06.840]  daily lie about us now and just say things on news on comedy shows in movies that there's directives
[1:37:07.560 --> 1:37:13.800]  to demonize us and shut us down and by the way i am so proud of that i sleep so good at night
[1:37:13.800 --> 1:37:21.000]  being john hancock at the top of the list i mean i couldn't sign my name bigger on this baby i mean
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:28.520]  i'm not going to risk my life and then not go 110 into this so whatever happens to me folks i my
[1:37:28.520 --> 1:37:34.120]  soul is clear i feel good i'm not murdering all those christians in syria i'm not opening our
[1:37:34.120 --> 1:37:37.640]  borders up and bringing people in here to have their babies for free i'm not putting cancer
[1:37:37.640 --> 1:37:42.600]  viruses and vaccines and feeding gmo to people i'm not lying to people telling them there's no
[1:37:42.600 --> 1:37:50.360]  vaccine bad reactions when the insert says it can kill you i'm not pushing life of satan the food and
[1:37:50.360 --> 1:37:58.040]  water i mean my job is really easy i treat people like i want to be treated and they think we're in
[1:37:58.040 --> 1:38:04.600]  this post moral world as carl rove told the new york times and washington post at a cocktail party
[1:38:06.840 --> 1:38:12.200]  he said it doesn't matter if iraq didn't have wmds we're just going to say they didn't did 911
[1:38:12.200 --> 1:38:16.920]  and we'll tell you what history and reality is and then you will dutifully report that and tomorrow
[1:38:16.920 --> 1:38:23.320]  we may change reality and then you'll follow that because we're history's actors now really because
[1:38:23.320 --> 1:38:28.040]  you inherited the biggest most wealthy powerful nation the world's ever seen and the incredible
[1:38:28.040 --> 1:38:33.800]  science and the brains that came here for freedom you inherited all that and then in 50 years have
[1:38:33.800 --> 1:38:38.920]  taken us from the biggest creditor nation the most respected nation the longest lived nation
[1:38:38.920 --> 1:38:44.760]  the smartest nation the toughest nation on every front and you turned us into the fattest dumbest
[1:38:44.760 --> 1:38:54.040]  most unhealthy evil nation you took all that and decided that you were god now because you stole the
[1:38:54.040 --> 1:39:01.480]  birthright of the renaissance and then claimed it to you as you try to usher in a new dark age
[1:39:01.480 --> 1:39:10.440]  you people are a joke you're not history's actor now carl rove you don't control reality
[1:39:10.440 --> 1:39:14.120]  everyone knows your war in iraq was a fraud for the soddies and others
[1:39:17.880 --> 1:39:26.440]  fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me well you know what america is starting to wake
[1:39:26.440 --> 1:39:31.400]  up and i don't mean the couch potatoes i just want to watch football all day and act tough america
[1:39:31.400 --> 1:39:35.240]  the real men and women of this country of every race color and creed are waking up in the world's
[1:39:35.240 --> 1:39:39.320]  waking up we're not going along with it uh john and i will i'm gonna hurry to maverick and others
[1:39:39.320 --> 1:39:44.840]  i'm just pontificating here today uh finish up your points about where this is going i mean i
[1:39:44.840 --> 1:39:48.600]  can't imagine when there's a real great depression again in this country what all these trendies are
[1:39:48.600 --> 1:39:53.720]  going to do i can't imagine what all the 50 million people on food stamps are going to do
[1:39:53.720 --> 1:40:02.040]  electronic soup kitchens i can't imagine what all these soft entitled people you know the black lives
[1:40:02.040 --> 1:40:07.720]  matter crowd that equated the 130 dead in france to a poop swastika and what they've gone through
[1:40:08.280 --> 1:40:14.840]  i can't imagine what's gonna happen when we get into a major depression where all this is going
[1:40:14.840 --> 1:40:19.480]  and they always start a war so it all fits together when the economy goes down they take you to war
[1:40:19.480 --> 1:40:24.520]  as elente says i want to get him on as soon as possible to cover all this this is just an epic

[1:40:40.920 --> 1:40:45.400]  to wake the american people up until it literally hits them at their dinner plate and literally
[1:40:45.400 --> 1:40:50.520]  pulls their wallet out and takes the rest of whatever they've already not gotten you know

[1:41:14.040 --> 1:41:21.080]  are going and by god we need to stand up and the one word that we all need to use time and time
[1:41:21.080 --> 1:41:25.320]  again is one of the very first words that we've ever learned from ever since the very day we're
[1:41:25.320 --> 1:41:31.960]  born is the word no the word no is very powerful if it takes everybody in the country around the
[1:41:31.960 --> 1:41:37.800]  world to stand up and say no in use and no you're not doing this no we're not taking it no we're not
[1:41:37.800 --> 1:41:44.280]  having it it takes that but we got to we have got to wake up the sleeping giant by god i'll tell you

[1:41:48.760 --> 1:41:52.680]  brother thank you all right i want to hurry through calls now because maverick's been holding a long
[1:41:52.680 --> 1:42:00.680]  time randy's been holding a long time um and others uh brendan has x air force turkey experience
[1:42:01.560 --> 1:42:05.960]  maverick as a pilot so i want to get to everybody we got two mavericks i've never seen that before
[1:42:05.960 --> 1:42:11.160]  uh maverick in colorado you worked on a cultural project in turkey thanks for holding
[1:42:13.080 --> 1:42:19.800]  hey alex um i just kind of wanted to talk a little bit about my experience uh working at for five
[1:42:19.800 --> 1:42:26.360]  years as an assistant to a world renowned cryptanalyst intelligence advisor who basically was
[1:42:26.360 --> 1:42:33.560]  involved with cultural projects and i was just going along for the rise um back in 2005 he told
[1:42:33.560 --> 1:42:41.080]  me to pay attention to a young senator from chicago who he had known in hawaii and that's a young
[1:42:41.080 --> 1:42:47.160]  man had a significant name because this this was going to be the president he would be used to create
[1:42:47.160 --> 1:42:55.400]  a sheite calisthenics so the stuff that i worked on with this individual um pat you know it was framed
[1:42:55.400 --> 1:43:01.720]  for a sheite calisthenics and i've known about this all the way back in 2005 so let's go ahead and
[1:43:01.720 --> 1:43:10.360]  jump forward 2008 2008 we're in turkey working on cultural projects for what was called istanbul
[1:43:10.360 --> 1:43:17.480]  2010 this was to bring turkey into the european union uh make a long story short the financial
[1:43:17.480 --> 1:43:24.200]  advisor disappeared uh cultural projects were canceled and george soros ended up with 150
[1:43:24.200 --> 1:43:31.240]  million dollars that was supposed to go to the project let's jump forward to 2011 i went up to
[1:43:31.240 --> 1:43:37.880]  canada work with this individual again this time this was for projects that were going to be happening
[1:43:37.880 --> 1:43:46.040]  in tunisia in august 2011 where we're going to be doing cultural exchanges of indigenous people
[1:43:46.600 --> 1:43:53.400]  and this was going to bring a large group of syrians to canada so in hindsight uh
[1:43:53.400 --> 1:43:57.560]  plus other things i'm not mentioning because there's sure these cultural projects are covers it
[1:43:57.560 --> 1:44:01.480]  wasn't really about bringing turkey into the euro it was about preparing all these different
[1:44:01.480 --> 1:44:08.040]  operations preparing the migrant floods getting the um change agents uh in place on the ground
[1:44:08.040 --> 1:44:15.400]  the social organizers the community organizers uh for the takeover of europe exactly and so
[1:44:15.960 --> 1:44:21.720]  when you see these things from the cultural side there's so much prep work that goes into it
[1:44:21.720 --> 1:44:27.960]  it's amazing how much time as you know how much of this was an event that here i'm talking to you
[1:44:27.960 --> 1:44:33.400]  about stuff it was being organized 10 years ago that we're now seeing and what people need to
[1:44:33.400 --> 1:44:39.240]  understand is these things know isis and all this stuff this stuff just doesn't happen overnight
[1:44:39.240 --> 1:44:44.360]  and it doesn't just pop out and they had the isis plan ready with exactly they had the isis
[1:44:44.360 --> 1:44:49.560]  plan ready before the global stage 9 11 with saudi arabia and their payoff the whole time
[1:44:49.560 --> 1:44:55.000]  was to give the entire region to saudi arabia for just halfway taking the blame but then physically
[1:44:55.000 --> 1:44:59.320]  iraq would be attacked it's it's totally insane and when you pull back then you can go research
[1:44:59.320 --> 1:45:05.960]  every part of it the cfr writes white papers admitting all this what's crazy is they admitted all
[1:45:07.160 --> 1:45:11.720]  a couple years ago they had a headline why we need al-qaeda in syria and how great they are
[1:45:11.720 --> 1:45:18.760]  and but then you'll have some dumbed-down tsa person wanting to stick their hands down my pants
[1:45:19.480 --> 1:45:23.960]  to make sure there's not a bomb there i mean it's just ridiculous while they leave the
[1:45:23.960 --> 1:45:30.040]  borders wide open amazing call maverick anything else you want to relay well yeah whenever i would
[1:45:30.040 --> 1:45:36.280]  travel with this guy we had we had free you know we never got stopped by tsa in fact they would
[1:45:36.280 --> 1:45:44.520]  pull us to a special line where we could just hustle right through um i mean i just i could go on for
[1:45:44.520 --> 1:45:49.400]  days sure if you actually join the people running the jihad takeover saudi arabians don't get
[1:45:49.400 --> 1:45:54.120]  searched when they come in either when you're part of the club it's it's like the rockefeller's
[1:45:54.120 --> 1:45:58.920]  old ruso you know you get the chip it's the kiss my butt get out of jail free card and that's why
[1:45:58.920 --> 1:46:04.120]  people want to enter this is because it's it's the new classism it's the new discrimination it's the
[1:46:04.120 --> 1:46:09.480]  new titles of nobility it's the new letters of mark it's being above the law i bless you i appreciate
[1:46:09.480 --> 1:46:14.680]  your call maverick i'm actually aware of those projects you're talking about they spent billions
[1:46:15.320 --> 1:46:19.800]  getting ready for this migrant takeover in the last decade they spent billions getting ready for
[1:46:19.800 --> 1:46:24.520]  the overthrow of ukraine and then the argument is well if we don't russia will take over the
[1:46:24.520 --> 1:46:33.080]  middle east russia isn't taking squat over russia can't even get its own affairs in place russia's
[1:46:33.080 --> 1:46:39.640]  weak politically after the globalists annihilated it for 97 years it's because russia might try to
[1:46:39.640 --> 1:46:45.400]  get back on its knees and off its belly that the globalists want to finish killing it just like they
[1:46:45.400 --> 1:46:50.280]  want to kill your church and kill your job and destroy your family and ship drugs in for your
[1:46:50.280 --> 1:46:54.760]  kids to use they want to screw everybody over because the russians are humans and they're
[1:46:54.760 --> 1:47:03.240]  red-blooded just like us that's why they hate them there's a big orthodox revival going on over there
[1:47:03.240 --> 1:47:08.520]  the russians really want what they couldn't have for 80-something years and the globalists hated
[1:47:08.520 --> 1:47:14.120]  that there's a christian country of 150 million people and they're dedicated to annihilating it
[1:47:14.120 --> 1:47:19.720]  just like they want to hurt you and your family same story randy brendan maverick
[1:47:19.720 --> 1:47:26.520]  let's go to brendan then randy then maverick brendan in idaho you're on the air thank you for
[1:47:26.520 --> 1:47:33.640]  holding hey thank you alex welcome uh yeah i just wanted to comment real quick uh i was over in uh
[1:47:34.200 --> 1:47:43.960]  uh insulin care based turkey uh 93 94 95 and uh at the time we had the northern no fly zone over
[1:47:43.960 --> 1:47:49.000]  iraq we had the nato contingent there the french british american and turkish air forces
[1:47:49.000 --> 1:47:56.760]  uh and then we had the operation provide comfort uh but i quickly realized after talking to pilots
[1:47:56.760 --> 1:48:03.320]  and crew and figuring out what was going on uh you know while the turks would take off in our old
[1:48:03.320 --> 1:48:12.200]  f4 phantoms that we sold them and bombed the uh kurdish people in the east uh the pkk would
[1:48:12.200 --> 1:48:19.160]  come down and attack us and attack the base and and uh and the turks and then from the same airstrip
[1:48:19.160 --> 1:48:26.040]  from the very state same airstrip uh the american contingent would fly c 130s over and drop pallets
[1:48:26.040 --> 1:48:33.240]  of band-aids and and mre's and and water bottles and what you were witnessing was full spectrum
[1:48:33.240 --> 1:48:39.720]  dominance with a globalist control the entire paradigm please continue uh yeah so that that's
[1:48:39.720 --> 1:48:46.680]  basically and this was you know basically 21 you know 20 21 years ago uh when that was going on
[1:48:46.680 --> 1:48:51.160]  and you know being a younger man you know you and i are the same age alex and so at that time you
[1:48:51.160 --> 1:48:56.200]  know i was joining the service after high school thinking i'm doing the you know a great thing
[1:48:56.200 --> 1:49:00.920]  for my country and then once i uh figured out what was going on i decided that you know this
[1:49:00.920 --> 1:49:05.080]  isn't what i signed up for and this isn't what i want to be were other people at the base putting
[1:49:05.080 --> 1:49:10.840]  two and two together uh they were they were it wasn't remember this was back in the you know
[1:49:10.840 --> 1:49:16.680]  early mid 90s so you know the internet wasn't uh you know it was really just taken off and
[1:49:16.680 --> 1:49:23.640]  and so word wasn't getting spread around as as easily and as quickly as it is now uh compared
[1:49:23.640 --> 1:49:30.520]  to then but uh you know i would talk to pilots and crew people from different squadrons uh you
[1:49:30.520 --> 1:49:35.960]  know do you have any idea what what what you're you know what you're involved with here you know we
[1:49:36.680 --> 1:49:42.760]  from the from the very same airstrip the turkish air force would drop bombs on the on the Kurdish
[1:49:42.760 --> 1:49:50.120]  people and then american c-130s would take off an hour or two hours later slower aircraft and
[1:49:50.120 --> 1:49:54.680]  dropped pallets of uh humanitarian aid on the same people who were just bombed so it makes
[1:49:54.680 --> 1:50:00.200]  absolutely no sense give me the vaccine that then makes you sick 10 years later and then they have
[1:50:00.200 --> 1:50:04.600]  all these patented treatments for it it's full spectrum dominance it's problem reaction solution
[1:50:04.600 --> 1:50:08.920]  chip the drugs and put your kids in prison for using them then put them in prisons for 25 cents
[1:50:08.920 --> 1:50:13.640]  an hour displacing everybody else's jobs and the good old boy goes good make them prisoners work
[1:50:13.640 --> 1:50:18.680]  but it doesn't know why a son can't get a good paying job full spectrum dominance consolidate
[1:50:18.680 --> 1:50:23.800]  control and obviously the Kurds have their beef with turkey because turkey took part of their land
[1:50:23.800 --> 1:50:30.760]  i'm let's not choose a side the point is you don't bomb them and then run a psych warfare op or you
[1:50:30.760 --> 1:50:35.240]  drop band-aids on them to make them think you're actually on their side and that's the type of
[1:50:35.240 --> 1:50:41.080]  double triple quadruple dealing uh that goes on but it's way beyond that they caught british special
[1:50:41.080 --> 1:50:47.720]  forces this was in the london guardian in 2005 dressed up like wahhabist attacking shiais to get a

[1:54:17.960 --> 1:54:27.480]  other us news economy news but here's the deal false flags manipulations they are part of warfare
[1:54:29.400 --> 1:54:33.720]  but you in history only did that against other men who were combatants
[1:54:35.160 --> 1:54:39.800]  and still that was seen as dirty and evil and it wasn't people were wimps during the age of
[1:54:39.800 --> 1:54:45.000]  chivalry it was that they didn't want their women and children being involved and once things get
[1:54:45.000 --> 1:54:52.600]  dirty they get dirty real fast so if one side's playing dirty and the other side isn't well then
[1:54:52.600 --> 1:54:57.080]  the folks that are playing dirty think they're real smart once things get dirty you find out it's
[1:54:57.080 --> 1:55:04.360]  not smart at all is it and so compared to other countries america was not as corrupt so we had
[1:55:04.360 --> 1:55:10.680]  the moral high ground even we didn't deserve it that's all gone down so the business where they're
[1:55:10.680 --> 1:55:14.600]  taken off from the same airfield which has come out in the news before that they were aiding the
[1:55:14.600 --> 1:55:20.440]  turks and bombing the curds and that's on record what he's telling you about he just witnessed it
[1:55:20.440 --> 1:55:26.360]  though that type of macchiavellian garbage doesn't work anymore because everybody knows our government
[1:55:26.360 --> 1:55:32.600]  supplying ices and not really bombing them you see because we're now known as evil we're now known
[1:55:32.600 --> 1:55:39.800]  as liars oh and so how smart are the little delicate geniuses up in washington that flushed our
[1:55:39.800 --> 1:55:46.920]  good name down the toilet brennan finish your point sorry oh no i appreciate it again alex thank
[1:55:46.920 --> 1:55:52.840]  you uh what i was going to add to that was you know watching turkey uh keeping an eye on them over

[1:56:00.600 --> 1:56:07.000]  there uh geographically uh just below russia and right there next to the middle east so uh you know
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:12.600]  i i had a feeling when all this got cranked up uh that the turkey was going to be was going to end
[1:56:12.600 --> 1:56:18.280]  up being directly involved front and center uh just just by you know the very nature of where
[1:56:18.280 --> 1:56:25.800]  it's located and and uh you know who all can can operate in an inside and outside of turkey
[1:56:25.800 --> 1:56:33.560]  more so uh eastern turkey and so like i said you know that that that those incidents were going on
[1:56:33.560 --> 1:56:39.320]  well over 20 years ago uh before all this uh the current business got started so you're right

[2:00:32.440 --> 2:00:37.560]  a second maverick in texas is a pilot what's your take on the shootdown of this russian aircraft
[2:00:37.560 --> 2:00:43.320]  and blowing up the rescue helicopter well inside syria with a u.s. made-toe missile i mean this is
[2:00:43.320 --> 2:00:48.600]  just sickening and now the russians have said there's gonna be a grievous response uh to the
[2:00:48.600 --> 2:01:01.320]  turks what do you think alex it's simple solving 9 11 ends the war christopher boland in his book
[2:01:01.320 --> 2:01:10.120]  and lectures solving 9 11 the deception that changed the world is an indictment of those
[2:01:10.120 --> 2:01:20.920]  at the top responsible for 9 11 the real terrorists everything that we discussed thus far is only a
[2:01:20.920 --> 2:01:28.760]  byproduct and it means that these same people are still running the criminal elements these
[2:01:28.760 --> 2:01:35.240]  are the criminal elements you always speak to that are inside our government even today
[2:01:38.520 --> 2:01:42.840]  well i haven't read boland's book uh i think i've interviewed that guy like 15 years ago or
[2:01:42.840 --> 2:01:47.800]  something he went off the radar it he wrote for american free press didn't he he was an
[2:01:47.800 --> 2:01:53.320]  investigative journalist at the time of 9 11 happened to be in new york city and was being paid
[2:01:53.320 --> 2:02:02.680]  uh to and encouraged uh his specials were false flags and also dr steven jones who he'll speak
[2:02:02.680 --> 2:02:09.720]  to i don't read him i don't read him a bunch yum you have there's about seven doctors that have
[2:02:09.720 --> 2:02:15.560]  signed on to papers that have been extremely peer reviewed that end the debate as to the official
[2:02:15.560 --> 2:02:22.440]  story of 9 11 the nano thermite that is detectable reproducible and using the most high tech
[2:02:22.440 --> 2:02:29.320]  equipment shows there's no way osama bin laden which takes months to install the nano thermite
[2:02:29.320 --> 2:02:33.720]  had anything to do with that i understand they blew up building seven i've got jones and films
[2:02:33.720 --> 2:02:41.000]  i made i mean really i'm i'm aware of 9 11 truth i started it literally um the the issue is we can
[2:02:41.000 --> 2:02:45.560]  prove with the 28 pages that saudi arabia was involved our government order to stand down
[2:02:46.680 --> 2:02:52.360]  that's been proven that opens up the whole deal then you find everything out if you go to the public
[2:02:52.360 --> 2:02:58.280]  get into nano thermite which i've done i made films about it then it they can try to debate it
[2:02:58.280 --> 2:03:03.960]  even if i mean you're correct and the national you know nist has admitted that building seven
[2:03:03.960 --> 2:03:07.960]  fell at freefall and i've interviewed the firefighters that saw the molten lava and they
[2:03:07.960 --> 2:03:12.120]  admitted the bombs and and they blew up building seven and announced it beforehand i'm believing
[2:03:12.120 --> 2:03:18.920]  i know i put on the 9 11 you know event in la that was on c span all of it i got death threats out
[2:03:18.920 --> 2:03:23.640]  the wazoo uh it's just now people say well why do you go to something that only shows part of it
[2:03:23.640 --> 2:03:31.960]  like the 28 pages it's like getting al capone on his taxes now you say you're a pilot i specifically
[2:03:31.960 --> 2:03:36.040]  we're kind of getting to 9 11 now i wanted to get your take on the shoot down to the aircraft
[2:03:36.040 --> 2:03:41.960]  real quick and the situation with the helicopter yes and i will and this all goes back to 9 11
[2:03:41.960 --> 2:03:46.920]  sebel edmund's who blew the whistle almost initially the most gag woman uh in his head
[2:03:46.920 --> 2:03:54.920]  her on many times already she yes you have and i'm thank god but she has already drawn all evidence
[2:03:54.920 --> 2:04:00.440]  testimony and connection between the turks that were running denis hasterd now known as a pedophile
[2:04:00.440 --> 2:04:06.840]  under control of larger forces now i need to say this christopher boland lays out the people
[2:04:06.840 --> 2:04:13.960]  and they have one organization it's peenak at a low level it is a zionist movement and the bible
[2:04:13.960 --> 2:04:19.560]  speaks to the jews that say they are jews and are not and then over satana satanic synagogue of
[2:04:19.560 --> 2:04:25.800]  satan and this goes on today yeah i mean there's obviously a jewish mafia involved the highest
[2:04:25.800 --> 2:04:30.120]  levels of new order the roth child's the rest of it i'm not denying the fact that that's there
[2:04:30.680 --> 2:04:36.920]  my only issue is people act like corrupt people in israel have the corner on macchiabellion
[2:04:36.920 --> 2:04:44.520]  operations and i just that's where i go with this i don't think israel is the only mover uh in all
[2:04:44.520 --> 2:04:48.360]  of this i mean look at israel they're they're killing their own presidents and prime ministers
[2:04:49.160 --> 2:04:53.480]  i mean so i just don't think it's one monolith i mean the folks that think israel run everything
[2:04:53.480 --> 2:04:57.240]  they think i actually am jewish and i get orders from israel i mean it's just not true
[2:04:58.600 --> 2:05:03.560]  him trammok michigan is experiencing culture shock after becoming the first majority muslim city in
[2:05:03.560 --> 2:05:08.120]  the us for example business owners routinely advertise their products in arabic and they
[2:05:08.120 --> 2:05:13.000]  can't obtain liquor licenses within 500 feet of a mosque but besides this cultural shift
[2:05:13.000 --> 2:05:18.440]  ham trammok also serves as a microcosm of america's economy ham trammok was the home of a chrysler
[2:05:18.440 --> 2:05:23.080]  automobile plant back during the muscle car era of the 60s and early 70s everything for
[2:05:23.080 --> 2:05:27.560]  in plinth barracudas the dodge charges were built at the ham trammok plant but now the plants closed
[2:05:27.560 --> 2:05:32.200]  down just like america's manufacturing base when the us dollar was chosen as the international
[2:05:32.200 --> 2:05:37.400]  medium of exchange decades ago us still had a strong manufacturing base but now it does it and the
[2:05:37.400 --> 2:05:41.400]  only reason why we're still able to maintain a trade deficit is due to global demand for the
[2:05:41.400 --> 2:05:45.480]  dollar but eventually other countries will stop accepting dollars for their products because we
[2:05:45.480 --> 2:05:49.800]  barely manufacture anything anymore one that happens the us economy will close down just
[2:05:49.800 --> 2:05:53.880]  like the ham trammok automobile plant did so many years ago this is kit daniels and visit

[2:09:24.360 --> 2:09:32.440]  what russia's response is to this incident um i figure that uh probably what they're going to do
[2:09:32.440 --> 2:09:40.120]  is step up the attacks on the taker trucks and completely cut off all that oil that turkey's been
[2:09:40.120 --> 2:09:47.240]  getting that's a good idea i mean it's better than oops bombs start falling over on the side of
[2:09:47.240 --> 2:09:52.600]  turkey i mean russia might go ahead and just start bombing the jihadis across the border and just
[2:09:52.600 --> 2:09:59.320]  let turkey have the next move yeah that could happen that way but uh i think putin's a lot
[2:09:59.320 --> 2:10:05.880]  smarter than that uh he doesn't want to get drug in to uh project a ground war over there
[2:10:08.680 --> 2:10:14.520]  you're you're absolutely right but you're kind of like can't be half pregnant you either are or you
[2:10:14.520 --> 2:10:19.720]  aren't and this is a ground war and they now are sitting in more us troops to basically back the
[2:10:19.720 --> 2:10:26.200]  jihadis and be human shields now the real war is here in america and in europe to just get the public
[2:10:26.200 --> 2:10:30.360]  to see the light of day that's all you got to stick your head out the window open the shades
[2:10:30.360 --> 2:10:35.000]  there it is you know 10 o'clock in the morning birds jumping around the backyard i mean it
[2:10:35.000 --> 2:10:40.280]  to open the door look at the facts that our governments are running the jihadis to destabilize
[2:10:40.280 --> 2:10:44.600]  the world they're opening our borders up bringing them in here to takash using the threat of the
[2:10:44.600 --> 2:10:51.800]  terrorists to take our rights that's the program and the war is an info war 90 percent of this war
[2:10:51.800 --> 2:10:57.400]  is an info war it was an info war two years ago that stopped the u.s military from openly being the
[2:10:57.400 --> 2:11:03.800]  air force for al-qaeda to start bombing you know cities in syria so we've already had some major
[2:11:03.800 --> 2:11:09.640]  info war victories for the moral authority of this country we the people are the country
[2:11:09.640 --> 2:11:17.320]  george washington is the country uh george washington carver is the country uh not the globalist
[2:11:17.320 --> 2:11:22.120]  hijackers of the nation they have hijacked us but they don't speak for us if you like if somebody
[2:11:22.120 --> 2:11:26.520]  stole your car and went around running people over with it you would want to announce and call the
[2:11:26.520 --> 2:11:31.240]  police hey that's not me with that car i see on the news running folks over with this license plate
[2:11:31.240 --> 2:11:37.640]  number that was stolen and and let me help you you know find out who might have stolen it because
[2:11:37.640 --> 2:11:42.760]  i saw on the news the video this guy running people over because if you don't explain you're not the
[2:11:42.760 --> 2:11:48.280]  one driving the car you're going to go to jail well it's the same thing we we've been hijacked now
[2:11:48.280 --> 2:11:53.960]  we're going to try to get our country back and if we can't get our country back by abstention
[2:11:55.080 --> 2:12:00.840]  we become guilty and and most americans i'm just going to say it i love america america is exceptional
[2:12:00.840 --> 2:12:05.320]  in many ways there's still a lot of good people here but we've also become exceptionally spoiled
[2:12:05.320 --> 2:12:11.720]  and arrogant and evil and disconnected from reality the average american can't find turkey on a map
[2:12:11.720 --> 2:12:15.880]  uh they you know it's like hillary made a joke and they said you know what were you doing with the
[2:12:15.880 --> 2:12:21.080]  weapons to turkey from mangasi and she said what's this about turkeys why aren't we talking about
[2:12:21.080 --> 2:12:26.360]  turkeys and everybody laughed because she knew the viewing audience would think that they were talking
[2:12:26.360 --> 2:12:35.160]  about a bird a 22 pound smoked bird delicious tasty bird um nothing about Thanksgiving but
[2:12:35.160 --> 2:12:42.600]  uh anything else randy no that's just about it uh i would like to put in one uh little note
[2:12:43.320 --> 2:12:52.760]  i try to wake up people every day and i'll wake up one or two and then they go around
[2:12:52.760 --> 2:13:00.280]  and start waking up one or two and that's how we fight the info war very well said my friend
[2:13:00.280 --> 2:13:06.520]  god bless you by the way before i was on this jag today about arming isis and all the situation
[2:13:06.520 --> 2:13:11.640]  matt drudge already on the same page had tweeted there's an article in info wars dot com drudge
[2:13:11.640 --> 2:13:16.920]  tweets america has been arming isis here's the full tweet a shocking truth is unfolding america
[2:13:16.920 --> 2:13:23.880]  has been arming isis and for you an informed listener you're like well tell us that we don't know
[2:13:24.520 --> 2:13:28.120]  well this is matt drudge telling all the mainline republicans this this is
[2:13:28.120 --> 2:13:34.600]  matt drudge sticking his neck out there and then linking to the proof where own government admits it
[2:13:37.400 --> 2:13:42.200]  so steve watson's article backs up what drudge is saying very important to get this out to
[2:13:42.200 --> 2:13:46.520]  everybody you know because this can stop the carnage and the evil and you can just write off
[2:13:46.520 --> 2:13:52.760]  you know syrian say oh let them all kill each other whatever suny shii jihadi let them do it
[2:13:52.760 --> 2:14:00.280]  but they're doing it to create a conduit to dump the huge migration waves into turkey right into europe
[2:14:00.840 --> 2:14:08.200]  they're blowing up the main southeastern gate of europe you know konstantinobel's the main
[2:14:08.840 --> 2:14:15.160]  invasion route the muslims used before over and over again it's called istanbul today it fell
[2:14:15.160 --> 2:14:23.400]  it was never retaken the great blue cathedrals now the blue mosque
[2:14:26.920 --> 2:14:31.400]  so we'll suffer the same fate of those christians in syria
[2:14:34.760 --> 2:14:39.880]  let's go to this very informative report also pretty silly but i'll say we're not as bad as la
[2:14:39.880 --> 2:14:45.240]  we're nine out of ten people would say you know ban black friday uh but it's it's close we did find
[2:14:45.240 --> 2:14:50.440]  some people that uh we're just showing you what we found that said ban black fridays as we're black
[2:14:50.440 --> 2:14:54.520]  in it and and and we're illustrating this because again they want to ban brown paper bags this is
[2:14:54.520 --> 2:15:00.280]  hurtful or all these fandoms of racism instead of the fact that we're all being discriminated against
[2:15:00.280 --> 2:15:07.240]  by having our liberties taken here is leon macadoo's report do you think that black friday has a racist
[2:15:07.240 --> 2:15:14.280]  connotation not really honestly yeah the thing about that i never really thought about it that way
[2:15:14.280 --> 2:15:22.520]  with racist connotations um i can see how it could be um definitely offensive to people i i don't know
[2:15:22.520 --> 2:15:29.880]  where my opinion stands on it as far as that goes sorry i'm just gonna i'm not familiar with the
[2:15:29.880 --> 2:15:37.080]  historical uh connotations of black friday hit pause so i'm back it up to the start i'm gonna
[2:15:37.080 --> 2:15:39.800]  skip the network break but the last one to the wake i'm gonna behead myself
[2:15:42.360 --> 2:15:51.480]  when you look at these women and these men you see helplessness you see weakness you see softness to
[2:15:51.480 --> 2:15:59.000]  a level never before seeing humans you see a disconnection from reality a foppish sick of
[2:15:59.000 --> 2:16:10.600]  hannock jellyfish like spirit and it's very frightening because there are armies of these
[2:16:10.600 --> 2:16:17.320]  people who have the right to vote do i guarantee you if you ask those same people do you support
[2:16:17.320 --> 2:16:24.680]  obama fighting aside they say oh yes i do i appreciate him his noble peace prize oh yeah i mean
[2:16:24.680 --> 2:16:32.920]  these are dangerous people like the mark dice folks he talks to were nine out of ten say yes arrest
[2:16:32.920 --> 2:16:36.760]  all gun owners okay we're gonna put them in forced labor camps oh yeah i'm sick of these people
[2:16:37.960 --> 2:16:42.920]  a lot of these folks would sit by while you and i are putting handcuffs and drug off to some gulag
[2:16:42.920 --> 2:16:45.800]  and just sit there on their little piggy hind ends thinking it's all cute
[2:16:45.800 --> 2:16:53.800]  and they are the product of so much wealth and prosperity created by the free market
[2:16:55.960 --> 2:16:59.400]  they are the byproduct they are the leavings
[2:17:01.880 --> 2:17:08.440]  and so i want a free market but it is a paradox it creates these spoiled rotten people
[2:17:09.320 --> 2:17:15.000]  and my children are spoiled and soft compared to my dad or compared to his father i mean i will
[2:17:15.000 --> 2:17:19.560]  tell you right now we don't have the workout that we did i don't have it i'm not knocking my kids
[2:17:19.560 --> 2:17:24.120]  my children are a reflection of me they're great children really sweet people love them they're
[2:17:24.120 --> 2:17:29.480]  smart compared to a lot of kids they're exceptional people see my son on air me he was like 11 he was
[2:17:29.480 --> 2:17:34.920]  on air and people were blown away i've sat around with former top nasa rocket scientists at dinner
[2:17:34.920 --> 2:17:39.320]  and they just you know love talking to rex every dad thinks their kids are exceptional but the point
[2:17:39.320 --> 2:17:47.000]  is mine are and yours are two in different ways humans are exceptional but you just have this
[2:17:47.000 --> 2:17:52.280]  entitlement and now they believe you conquer the world by getting in politically correct groups
[2:17:52.280 --> 2:17:57.480]  and then bitching and complaining and then finding phantoms of your lost liberty while every basic
[2:17:57.480 --> 2:18:04.440]  freedom we've got is being destroyed being wrecking bald being demolished being demolitioned in front
[2:18:04.440 --> 2:18:14.040]  of us and if they can just feel good about something and say they support it then they're all goofy
[2:18:14.040 --> 2:18:18.200]  and happy but if you say hey i got some work for you to do in the fight against the oh oh no i got
[2:18:18.200 --> 2:18:23.160]  to go i got to go but if they can like oh yeah i can see how that's a fence of don't know the history
[2:18:23.160 --> 2:18:32.840]  of it black means from accounting going back more than 400 years in europe black ink on the ledger
[2:18:32.840 --> 2:18:39.480]  is profit red ink is loss and when you write something off or it's a loss you're in the red
[2:18:41.240 --> 2:18:46.360]  but see none of these people know what it is to have a business or actually have to run things
[2:18:46.360 --> 2:18:52.120]  because they go to college and they get loans and they get hired at government or at google to just
[2:18:52.120 --> 2:18:59.080]  conform and uh you're not going to be around in the future you're being weakened in the preparation
[2:18:59.080 --> 2:19:04.680]  to be soft killed by the fluoride the gmo and the shots idiot and you won't know when you're 35
[2:19:04.680 --> 2:19:09.880]  dying of cancer why you're dying you won't know why your neighbors 20 and dying you won't know why
[2:19:09.880 --> 2:19:14.600]  lung cancer is up in the last 20 or seven fold in women you won't know why every other baby is
[2:19:14.600 --> 2:19:20.760]  going to be retarded you won't know because you already got killed and then you look at somebody
[2:19:20.760 --> 2:19:30.680]  like me who's nothing special i'm a throwback that's what one of my grandfathers called me
[2:19:30.680 --> 2:19:36.920]  and it wasn't an insult but all the old men you could see me and how i behaved as a young person
[2:19:36.920 --> 2:19:43.080]  like a man they'd say oh this one this is a good one this is a throwback it didn't mean it was throwing
[2:19:43.080 --> 2:19:49.560]  back i was gonna ride around the backs of horses and then i was aggressive i had a look in my eye i
[2:19:49.560 --> 2:19:56.920]  wanted knowledge i knew how to talk to men i wanted responsibility i was a man when i was
[2:19:56.920 --> 2:20:03.400]  12 years old not a rest of development at 30 believe it i could go join some political
[2:20:03.400 --> 2:20:09.400]  organization to become a man and have some rite of passage they've taken the rites of passage away
[2:20:10.120 --> 2:20:16.920]  thank god i had mine thank god my parents cut me loose and wouldn't call the police when i got beat
[2:20:16.920 --> 2:20:23.000]  up when i was a kid over a hundred times before i learned how to fight and it wasn't because they
[2:20:23.000 --> 2:20:28.200]  were bad people they were good people and i haven't done that with my children and it makes me wonder
[2:20:30.840 --> 2:20:34.120]  but the truth is the world's too much of a dangerous place and i have to give them
[2:20:34.120 --> 2:20:38.040]  mental prowess to understand the threats of the world not physical because that's how
[2:20:38.040 --> 2:20:42.760]  the fight of the future will be decided and i've been a good father overall but you've
[2:20:42.760 --> 2:20:48.840]  got away the old ways with the new waves and realize the new waves are to turn us into these jellyfish
[2:20:49.800 --> 2:20:52.760]  let's go ahead and go back to the beginning of william macadam's report i will not interrupt
[2:20:52.760 --> 2:20:58.120]  at this time but just listen to the abject viciously dangerous ignorance of these people
[2:20:58.120 --> 2:21:05.080]  and i don't hate them if i was out on a mesa and there was a bunch of cows up on the top of it
[2:21:05.080 --> 2:21:10.280]  and somebody fired a gun off and hit one of them in the rear end and it started stampeding
[2:21:10.280 --> 2:21:14.440]  i don't hate a thousand head of cattle running right at me i don't have some personal thing
[2:21:14.440 --> 2:21:19.320]  against them i don't get off intellectually in a sardonic way that i'm smarter than those cows
[2:21:20.840 --> 2:21:25.320]  i see a thousand cows coming at me i'm looking for a hole to get in i'm looking for a tree to climb
[2:21:25.320 --> 2:21:31.560]  i'm looking for a way to get out of their way before they run me over because a big pack of dumb
[2:21:31.560 --> 2:21:37.080]  people is as dangerous as it gets and they'll stomp you into the ground and they can be directed
[2:21:37.080 --> 2:21:46.840]  by the globalist to overrun everything we've ever built they are a plague let's go to this clip
[2:21:48.120 --> 2:21:51.320]  do you think that black friday has a racist connotation
[2:21:53.400 --> 2:21:58.040]  not really honestly yeah the thing about that i never really thought about in that way with
[2:21:58.040 --> 2:22:06.520]  racist connotations um i can see how it could be um definitely offensive to people i don't know where
[2:22:06.520 --> 2:22:13.320]  my opinion stands on it as far as that goes sorry i'm just gonna i'm not familiar with the
[2:22:13.320 --> 2:22:21.000]  historical uh connotations of black friday so i'm not sure if that question even applies or not
[2:22:21.000 --> 2:22:24.760]  like it could it could not but i just don't know i don't even know what the beginning of black what
[2:22:24.760 --> 2:22:29.480]  is like the beginnings of black friday what is like the origin of it well no one really knows
[2:22:29.480 --> 2:22:33.800]  but there are a lot of things that people are alleging and it's kind of like a black lives matter
[2:22:33.800 --> 2:22:38.920]  uh concern with this that that it had something to do with slavery i said i wouldn't do it yes
[2:22:38.920 --> 2:22:42.760]  black lives matter is actually saying it's racist so i said go out and ask what's racist they did
[2:22:42.760 --> 2:22:46.680]  research and sure enough people are already saying it everyone keeps saying they don't know
[2:22:46.680 --> 2:22:53.080]  it meets the time for businesses to get in the black and a lot of states do the thing where
[2:22:53.080 --> 2:22:58.920]  they don't have any taxes on that day so it's about you getting in the black then getting in the black
[2:22:58.920 --> 2:23:05.080]  it's about prosperity that's what black friday is let's go back to it and that they would sell
[2:23:05.080 --> 2:23:10.520]  their slaves at a discount in order to you know get the plantations uh filled with workers for the
[2:23:10.520 --> 2:23:19.160]  harsh winter i think i did hear that before but i mean now they do it for discount items every year
[2:23:19.160 --> 2:23:23.160]  this is people kind of they get back up again to that black guy that's the smart person there
[2:23:23.160 --> 2:23:31.000]  you see who cares if some slave owner started and built a university you got a scholarship
[2:23:31.000 --> 2:23:36.920]  you're going there who cares about freaking out about it i mean who cares if it was connected
[2:23:36.920 --> 2:23:42.200]  to racism you get discounts on the day at least you see so it's not racist because it doesn't
[2:23:42.200 --> 2:23:47.800]  mean that anymore it's like if i say give me a faggot 50 years ago in england that meant a
[2:23:47.800 --> 2:23:53.400]  cigarette they still call them that there yeah you say that here so i want to punch you in the nose
[2:23:53.400 --> 2:23:58.760]  a faggot just means a burning ember of wood let's see people taken over those words they took the
[2:23:58.760 --> 2:24:07.800]  word gay which meant a happy day kalu kalei frabjus day it burbled as it went and snoopal
[2:24:07.800 --> 2:24:16.120]  snorped what is that the jabber walkie ah anyways and burbled is it let's go back to the piece sorry
[2:24:16.120 --> 2:24:24.520]  here it is but i mean now they do it for discount items every year this people kind of they get a
[2:24:24.520 --> 2:24:30.120]  little bit offended by it and so we really really don't even know that dear okay the problem is who
[2:24:30.120 --> 2:24:34.520]  is being offended like is it like the non-black community or is it the black community because if
[2:24:34.520 --> 2:24:39.240]  black community is offended then i would be more for changing it than if like someone who wasn't
[2:24:39.240 --> 2:24:43.480]  black was offended you know because they only want to get to decide whether or not something has
[2:24:43.480 --> 2:24:48.360]  offensive conditions to them back up do you hear the level of it as you hear this weird twisted
[2:24:48.360 --> 2:24:53.400]  logic well if the black community is offended well how who speaks for the black community
[2:24:54.440 --> 2:24:57.960]  it's like saying the white community you know how many different views there are all white people
[2:24:57.960 --> 2:25:06.760]  and black people it's just it's just as collective as view oh the black mouth will tell us what we do
[2:25:06.760 --> 2:25:13.880]  but if someone else is offended well then it doesn't matter well let me tell you who came
[2:25:13.880 --> 2:25:17.560]  up with us a bunch of white people to jack with everybody because they wanted to exterminate
[2:25:17.560 --> 2:25:21.000]  all the blacks they had to buy them off get control of them get them on welfare it's all
[2:25:21.000 --> 2:25:24.760]  been declassified it's all admitted Margaret Sanger all nine yards you can read thousands of
[2:25:24.760 --> 2:25:29.560]  pages of white papers just go to the Colgate Foundation others read the uh the proctor and
[2:25:29.560 --> 2:25:35.000]  gamble stuff all of it and they've done a job you can sit there and go half the black people are
[2:25:35.000 --> 2:25:42.200]  aborted I don't care shut up white I saw a poop swastika I'm like okay but there's a whole plan
[2:25:42.200 --> 2:25:46.760]  to kill everybody let's let's just set that up shut up I don't care about that Rachel Maddow didn't
[2:25:46.760 --> 2:25:50.280]  say a word about that Reverend Sharpton didn't say a word about that
[2:25:54.600 --> 2:25:59.720]  well fluoride them shut up there's no black lobby out there worried about fluoride or
[2:25:59.720 --> 2:26:05.560]  vaccines or anything no does the NAACP is there to keep black people on the plantation does that
[2:26:05.560 --> 2:26:10.200]  mean every member of the NAACP is a bad guy no they they don't know what's going on like everybody
[2:26:10.200 --> 2:26:17.560]  else everybody's being targeted everybody's getting screwed over I gotta stop I said I would
[2:26:17.560 --> 2:26:21.800]  interrupt it it's just too incredible let's go back to the piece okay the problem is who is being
[2:26:21.800 --> 2:26:26.120]  offended like is it like the non-black community or is it the black community because if the black
[2:26:26.120 --> 2:26:30.840]  community is offended then I would be more for changing it than if like someone who wasn't black
[2:26:30.840 --> 2:26:34.680]  was offended you know because they're the only ones who get to decide whether or not something
[2:26:34.680 --> 2:26:38.600]  has offensive connotations to them because they're the community has lived through the historical
[2:26:38.600 --> 2:26:47.560]  implications do you think we should rename black friday you're talking to a smartphone no why is
[2:26:47.560 --> 2:26:54.760]  that have you checked your privilege well actually I'm going to reverse that statement
[2:26:54.760 --> 2:26:58.520]  now that I actually thought it through I can see where racism would come up there should
[2:26:58.520 --> 2:27:04.440]  definitely be a new name for it um I'm not sure but any ideas well something that would be more
[2:27:04.440 --> 2:27:11.560]  color neutral or I mean I wouldn't go color then since that's still like race implied I guess no
[2:27:11.560 --> 2:27:15.880]  if people agree with that opinion then yeah of course it's it's not right but what would they
[2:27:15.880 --> 2:27:23.240]  change it to do any ideas african-american friday okay that's a good potential you gotta have
[2:27:23.240 --> 2:27:28.120]  something that has a ring to it yeah that's the thing you can't think of anything that has a ring
[2:27:28.120 --> 2:27:44.360]  to it at least they didn't use the n-word the annual walmart brawl how about that
[2:27:47.880 --> 2:27:52.920]  so in front of the black friday hysteria the moms and this is because the perceived special
[2:27:52.920 --> 2:27:58.120]  they want to believe they're about to win the lottery they want to believe that that they were
[2:27:58.120 --> 2:28:03.080]  winners that they got the magic ticket even though it's one of the worst days of shop on average
[2:28:03.080 --> 2:28:09.480]  there's some stores do give good deals but overall one of the worst look it up I mean why would anybody
[2:28:09.480 --> 2:28:14.520]  go it sounds like an awful way to spend a day exactly beat up maybe they call it black friday
[2:28:14.520 --> 2:28:19.320]  because you have to be like a black belt in karate to you know that could be it discount day
[2:28:19.320 --> 2:28:25.720]  don't kill each other day please that's not for me to decide that's for the community to
[2:28:25.720 --> 2:28:30.040]  decide what is and isn't offensive to them and wasn't a suitable oh she can't decide
[2:28:30.040 --> 2:28:37.160]  if the community not racist I think people would have to speak up and if people were to say
[2:28:37.160 --> 2:28:41.080]  something if it was something that was heard by the population I think people would sympathize
[2:28:41.080 --> 2:28:47.480]  with it if it was something that they felt was racist so even if it's not necessarily true though
[2:28:47.480 --> 2:28:52.520]  I see a lot on college campuses right now a lot of things are happening because of the way people
[2:28:52.520 --> 2:28:56.520]  feel because they're offended because it's you know it upsets them with the way they feel even
[2:28:56.520 --> 2:29:00.920]  though it might not necessarily be truth or no evidence to it if someone is a generally find
[2:29:00.920 --> 2:29:05.720]  something like offensives and we should find like the best way to like accommodate everyone and the
[2:29:05.720 --> 2:29:09.400]  way that we act with each other and the way we speak because they're like they go kind of hand
[2:29:09.400 --> 2:29:14.840]  in hand I think so yeah if they want something changed then I think it's it's for the better
[2:29:14.840 --> 2:29:18.680]  if it if it makes people feel better go for it you think this is a smart direction we're going in
[2:29:19.800 --> 2:29:25.480]  hopefully is feelings over facts I hope it will we should do facts over feelings first and I hope
[2:29:25.480 --> 2:29:29.320]  it is a fact because we're in a college if they don't know what they're talking about then
[2:29:32.040 --> 2:29:37.320]  lower prices and don't kill each other everything must go as long as it's racist
[2:29:37.320 --> 2:29:43.480]  all right that's Liam McAdoo's report the unedited video without me interrupting

[2:34:08.120 --> 2:34:13.960]  for liberty and was ron paul's legislative director for a long time they are quarterbacking my
[2:34:13.960 --> 2:34:18.200]  favorite word i moved to continue to audit the fed they've gotten very close to it so we're going to
[2:34:18.200 --> 2:34:25.800]  be talking to him here in just a minute first off we just talked about black friday you again
[2:34:25.800 --> 2:34:30.600]  you go to us today wall street journal consumer reports and get different views on it but it's
[2:34:30.600 --> 2:34:39.880]  all pretty much the same the best time of the year to buy products is cyclically after big holidays
[2:34:39.880 --> 2:34:46.760]  and when it's a slow time of the year that could be the middle of the summer it could be in the
[2:34:46.760 --> 2:34:53.560]  spring it depends on what you're buying if you're buying gardening furniture or garden furniture
[2:34:53.560 --> 2:35:00.520]  or pool furniture you want to buy it in the winter if you're buying a boat it's like 15 years ago i
[2:35:00.520 --> 2:35:05.320]  bought a modest fishing ski boat and i bought it in the winter and people couldn't believe the price
[2:35:05.320 --> 2:35:10.360]  i got i mean i got like quarter off on it because i bought it in the winter talked to a guy about
[2:35:10.360 --> 2:35:14.920]  the same thing it was a lot more as he bought it in the summer uh houses cost more in the summer
[2:35:14.920 --> 2:35:18.680]  people just sell more houses in the summer prices go up for homes in the summer
[2:35:18.680 --> 2:35:26.120]  but bottom line black friday is not one of the best times to go out and buy and folks like walmart
[2:35:26.120 --> 2:35:32.600]  and others have been caught jacking up prices a week before then lowering them the week of but
[2:35:32.600 --> 2:35:38.440]  it's still just the regular price when we have sales at m4store.com or the nutraceutical site
[2:35:38.440 --> 2:35:47.240]  m4slive.com i mean when it says 25 off on the new deep cleanse product so popular that's 25
[2:35:47.240 --> 2:35:53.080]  percent off when we say 30 off brain force that's already off the discounted price 33 percent off

[2:36:55.000 --> 2:36:58.920]  at the top of the pyramid controlling this country is the private run-for-profit
[2:36:59.880 --> 2:37:05.240]  quasi-governmental federal reserve it has quasi-governmental powers and we have famous clips
[2:37:05.240 --> 2:37:11.160]  we got to cue that up of a green span saying on the lair news hour that congress has no authority
[2:37:11.160 --> 2:37:16.680]  over the fed it's independent fourth branch of government three branches folks not the fed
[2:37:16.680 --> 2:37:23.400]  1913 same year we got the income tax no mistake there and ron paul went from being in congress back
[2:37:23.400 --> 2:37:30.120]  in 96 and getting no cosponsors to passing it in the house going to the senate where people like
[2:37:30.120 --> 2:37:35.480]  bernie sanders who claimed he was for it killed it never forget that he claims he's against the
[2:37:35.480 --> 2:37:42.520]  big banks he's full of it got brad pit out talking about about the big banks yeah sure every time
[2:37:42.520 --> 2:37:48.280]  they do that they pass regulations shutting down local banks norm singleton worked for congressman
[2:37:48.280 --> 2:37:55.080]  ron paul from 97 2012 he served as legislative aid on education and workforce issues for congressman
[2:37:55.080 --> 2:37:59.640]  paul when he became congressman paul's legislative director position he held until congressman paul
[2:37:59.640 --> 2:38:05.160]  left congress mr singleton also serves volunteer policy director with ron paul 2012 presidential
[2:38:05.160 --> 2:38:10.200]  campaign prior to working for ron paul mr singleton worked for the national right to work committee
[2:38:10.200 --> 2:38:15.720]  mr singleton graduated cum laude from washington and jefferson college with a degree in economics
[2:38:15.720 --> 2:38:19.640]  and i'm not going to go through all of his background he's also a university of pittsburgh
[2:38:19.640 --> 2:38:26.200]  school of law graduate campaign for liberty dot org and he's heading up the move to audit the fed
[2:38:26.200 --> 2:38:31.240]  here is the article congress takes key step to audit the fed but will it actually happen well
[2:38:31.240 --> 2:38:37.400]  that's up to you folks you notice we got rid of bainer didn't we i mean that so uh two steps
[2:38:37.400 --> 2:38:42.360]  forward one step back it's better than two steps back so we're moving forward thanks to you and
[2:38:42.360 --> 2:38:46.280]  that's why norm singleton's here first off hope you have a great thanksgiving sir and
[2:38:46.280 --> 2:38:50.840]  want to commend you for all your stalwart effort in the fight for liberty uh tell us about the
[2:38:50.840 --> 2:38:57.000]  current battle lines to try to get rid of the private central bank thank you sir and uh happy
[2:38:57.000 --> 2:39:01.720]  thanksgiving to you and happy thanksgiving to all of your listeners it's a real pleasure to be on
[2:39:02.360 --> 2:39:11.400]  the show uh several weeks ago senator ran paul um put uh introduced a new version of audit the fed
[2:39:11.400 --> 2:39:17.720]  and he used a little senate procedure called rule 14 where he uh senator can get up an object to
[2:39:17.720 --> 2:39:22.680]  the third reading of the bill and have it placed directly on the senate calendar which means that
[2:39:22.680 --> 2:39:28.280]  at any given time and we understand it's going to be sometime the next two to three weeks the
[2:39:28.280 --> 2:39:34.120]  senate can be forced to vote on it the reason senator paul did this is because the audit the
[2:39:34.120 --> 2:39:40.840]  fed bill has been uh tied up in committee and there are a couple of fed apologists on the
[2:39:40.840 --> 2:39:48.440]  banking committee um real strong fed apologists uh senator bob porker of tennessee has uh been an
[2:39:48.440 --> 2:39:55.080]  opponent of audit the fed he's on the committee and elizabeth warn who uh is another one who likes
[2:39:55.080 --> 2:40:01.160]  senator sanders claims to be for transparency claims to be an opponent of crony capitalism
[2:40:01.160 --> 2:40:08.280]  and the big banks yet she opposes opening the books of the really facilitator of crony capitalism
[2:40:08.280 --> 2:40:14.200]  which is audit the fed yes sir which is why and so campaign for liberty is right now doing an effort
[2:40:14.200 --> 2:40:20.760]  to uh collect as many petitions as possible we've already sent in over 70 000 we're trying to get
[2:40:20.760 --> 2:40:27.000]  more you can go to our website campaign for liberty dot org and in the spirit of the season um
[2:40:28.280 --> 2:40:35.880]  people can uh enter and win an ar 15 uh anyone who signs a petition will be automatically entered
[2:40:35.880 --> 2:40:44.840]  into the drawing for a great ar 15 and uh you can uh this would uh uh make a great christmas present
[2:40:44.840 --> 2:40:55.240]  to uh give to someone uh who uh is uh desiring of a of a firearm you can uh maybe win a win a gun
[2:40:55.240 --> 2:41:01.240]  and help campaign for liberty's efforts to pass on at the fed so that is really a win win for
[2:41:01.240 --> 2:41:07.320]  everybody who uh values individual liberty and limited government well that only makes it that
[2:41:07.320 --> 2:41:11.160]  much better as it promotes the second amendment and also you know puts a stick in the eye of the
[2:41:11.160 --> 2:41:16.360]  victim disarmament folks but you know i can play the msnbc clips too and cnbc where they admit we're
[2:41:16.360 --> 2:41:21.080]  all ruled by central banks they now appoint the leaders of europe basically i mean it just gets
[2:41:21.080 --> 2:41:25.640]  crazier and crazier but but since we're pushing for this again you probably should since you've
[2:41:25.640 --> 2:41:31.800]  been there since the beginning sir uh maybe chronicle the saga where we've come from nowhere
[2:41:31.800 --> 2:41:37.160]  to the one-yard line in sudden death overtime with 30 seconds on the clock because the things
[2:41:37.160 --> 2:41:42.120]  are getting close to collapsing but we're very close to getting this audit i mean what an idea
[2:41:42.120 --> 2:41:47.560]  that we actually audit this private run-for-profit institution that admittedly has given trillions
[2:41:47.560 --> 2:41:54.680]  to offshore banks of us taxpayer backed money i mean this is just crazy right what what we uh
[2:41:54.680 --> 2:42:00.760]  uh this started um during the well back in the of course uh commerce and paul was first
[2:42:01.320 --> 2:42:06.600]  inspired to run when nixon closed the gold standard and he saw the dangers of our moving
[2:42:06.600 --> 2:42:14.280]  to a completely fed dominated fiat currency system and throughout the 70s and 80s uh he has
[2:42:14.280 --> 2:42:21.000]  been a voice for um real monetary reform for federal reserve transparency and then for um
[2:42:21.000 --> 2:42:29.720]  um as a stepping stone to transforming back to market driven currencies uh and for years though
[2:42:30.600 --> 2:42:35.960]  in the house of representative he was the only one who would bring these issues up at fed hearings
[2:42:35.960 --> 2:42:41.240]  he would challenge greenspan and bernanke and he was kind of dismissed kind of laughed at
[2:42:41.240 --> 2:42:49.000]  and then two things happened in 07 and 08 one uh which i know you you everybody in your audience
[2:42:49.000 --> 2:42:55.800]  i i know remembers both of these events one was his tremendous uh run for the presidency and that
[2:42:55.800 --> 2:43:02.600]  of course uh really shocked a lot of people uh including a lot of us on dr paul's staff and
[2:43:02.600 --> 2:43:08.040]  in his inner circle when we saw him talking to college students and they were chanting and the fed
[2:43:08.040 --> 2:43:14.200]  they were uh waving copies of books by murray rothbard and levith von mesis and f i hayek uh
[2:43:14.200 --> 2:43:19.880]  and it just this turned out to be just this tremendous grassroots uh movement that cut on
[2:43:19.880 --> 2:43:25.640]  that uh was just waiting for someone like ron paul to emerge on the national scene and talk about
[2:43:25.640 --> 2:43:33.400]  and tell the truth about our monetary policy our foreign policy our deficits and then right after
[2:43:33.400 --> 2:43:38.280]  that there was the great meltdown the great housing crash the great explosion of the bubble
[2:43:38.280 --> 2:43:46.120]  followed by the the big bailouts and that was what really proved to a lot of people that
[2:43:46.120 --> 2:43:50.840]  ron paul was right in fact i remember being in the congressional office in those days
[2:43:50.840 --> 2:43:55.560]  and there was a lot of mainstream journalists who wanted to talk to dr paul and these tenor
[2:43:55.560 --> 2:44:00.120]  of the interviews was well we laughed at you six months ago when you told us this was going to
[2:44:00.120 --> 2:44:04.600]  happen but it turns out you were right so what did you see that the rest of us didn't see and of
[2:44:04.600 --> 2:44:11.320]  course they they didn't like dr paul's answers but uh out of that campaign he founded campaign for
[2:44:11.320 --> 2:44:16.360]  liberty and since day one campaign for liberty signature issue has been to audit the fed it's
[2:44:16.360 --> 2:44:21.960]  passed the house twice unfortunately we were never able uh to get it through the senate which is why
[2:44:21.960 --> 2:44:27.800]  the senate vote is a big deal because if we get it if even if there's a vote on the senate at least
[2:44:27.800 --> 2:44:33.800]  you'll do what politicians really hate which is be on record on an issue that might alienate a power
[2:44:33.800 --> 2:44:39.400]  sure we've gone from nowhere to almost winning and so we need to really push hard now uh because as
[2:44:39.400 --> 2:44:43.960]  things get more and more uh out of control with the private run for profit fellow reserve system
[2:44:43.960 --> 2:44:50.520]  and its sister outfits in europe we need them to get the discrediting that is their due obviously
[2:44:50.520 --> 2:44:55.080]  but uh for folks that don't keep track of this let me just give people a minute or two synopsis and
[2:44:55.080 --> 2:45:00.120]  i want to see if you concur with it ron paul and and what you and his supporters and i and countless
[2:45:00.120 --> 2:45:06.760]  others were able to do was actually fill the vacuum because of controlled republican democratic
[2:45:06.760 --> 2:45:11.960]  groups that existed with something that was pro america pro freedom pro free market
[2:45:11.960 --> 2:45:18.360]  anti crony capitalist starting when ron paul first ran for president uh you know 10 years ago or so
[2:45:18.360 --> 2:45:27.000]  or longer of course he ran before that back in the uh you know uh late 80s but now we're at this point
[2:45:27.000 --> 2:45:32.280]  where we've gotten a lot of good tea party people elected that are more campaign for liberty style
[2:45:32.280 --> 2:45:40.120]  and who aren't the republican uh fake counterfeit tea party and that's the main enemy of the republican
[2:45:40.120 --> 2:45:47.320]  democratic leadership and they admit they're scared of the libertarian patriot move to unseat them so
[2:45:47.320 --> 2:45:53.880]  the real opposition is state governments local governments and federally the campaign for liberty
[2:45:53.880 --> 2:45:58.520]  coalition and that's why you get ron paul demonized why they ignore him why they attacking
[2:45:59.400 --> 2:46:05.720]  why they do all of that is because they know he's another representation of that and so that's
[2:46:05.720 --> 2:46:10.440]  why it's so important for people to be involved with campaign for liberty to be involved uh with
[2:46:10.440 --> 2:46:16.280]  with ron paul's campaign to be involved because when loser draw we're injecting the real issues
[2:46:16.920 --> 2:46:21.160]  that hey government's too big hey we've devalued the dollar hey we can't take from the next
[2:46:21.160 --> 2:46:25.800]  generation to give to ourselves uh but but now we've been hearing hey the next generation
[2:46:25.800 --> 2:46:30.920]  for 30 40 years we're now here we're about to pay the comeuppance and you're a smart guy
[2:46:30.920 --> 2:46:35.240]  and talking to a lot of other smart people norm singleton of campaign for liberty dot org
[2:46:36.760 --> 2:46:43.080]  what do you think uh i mean a about what i just said is that true but b about how serious
[2:46:43.080 --> 2:46:50.760]  this global financial meltdown really is i think that uh your analysis is spot on um the republican
[2:46:50.760 --> 2:46:56.920]  establishment they do not uh they do not like uh the tea party group they certainly don't like
[2:46:56.920 --> 2:47:03.960]  the liberty movement um i was on the floor of tampa in 2012 when they uh did the rules change
[2:47:03.960 --> 2:47:09.000]  and speaker bainer read from the teleprompter i know you remember this alex yes read from the
[2:47:09.000 --> 2:47:14.600]  teleprompter that the the eyes have it and it was clear if you were on the floor that was debatable
[2:47:14.600 --> 2:47:21.640]  to say the least and um the reason that audit the fed is become an issue that most republicans
[2:47:21.640 --> 2:47:26.600]  actually support is because of campaign for liberty's mobilization of all those americans
[2:47:26.600 --> 2:47:31.480]  that were woken up by dr paul to put pressure on congress and that's why it is important that
[2:47:31.480 --> 2:47:37.880]  people go to campaign for liberty dot org check us out check out our uh our issues our activities
[2:47:38.520 --> 2:47:43.720]  we were very recently just last month we were uh very involved and i think we might have been
[2:47:43.720 --> 2:47:50.440]  the only organization that really tried to fight this god awful budget deal and stand up with uh
[2:47:50.440 --> 2:47:58.680]  rand paul and uh other tea party senators like ten crews to try to stop this uh awful budget deal
[2:47:58.680 --> 2:48:04.200]  which was a repudiation of everything that the liberty movement had had been fighting for and
[2:48:04.200 --> 2:48:10.200]  everything that the tea party was supposed to believe in uh on the financial collapse um i
[2:48:10.200 --> 2:48:14.520]  i think that uh there's a lot of reason to be worried about the global economy when you look
[2:48:14.520 --> 2:48:19.240]  at priest when you look at the reports coming out about the fed and and how the fed keeps saying
[2:48:19.240 --> 2:48:25.080]  oh an interest rate hike is just around the corner but not now and they always find an excuse and i
[2:48:25.080 --> 2:48:32.040]  will bet that they will use the uh global instability and the panic of ices uh to say next
[2:48:32.040 --> 2:48:36.840]  month we're going to have to delay our rate increase because right now uh with the fear in
[2:48:36.840 --> 2:48:43.480]  the markets just like they use the 9 11 after 9 11 that's when green span really again pumped up the
[2:48:43.480 --> 2:48:51.000]  money creation uh to to do that but we really won't know what their evaluation of the situation is
[2:48:51.000 --> 2:48:57.000]  and what deals they may or may not have made would say Greece or the eu to bail them out to bill out
[2:48:58.360 --> 2:49:04.200]  wall street firms in the event that this thing really that we do experience another 08 or worse
[2:49:04.200 --> 2:49:10.600]  until we pass the audit bill and unfortunate and there was a story yesterday it's up on our blog
[2:49:10.600 --> 2:49:17.160]  about how um the fed leaks sometimes confidential information to certain investors as a way of
[2:49:17.160 --> 2:49:21.720]  testing how their policies will be received by the marketplace yeah that's a nice way of saying
[2:49:21.720 --> 2:49:28.440]  insider trading yeah yeah exactly if you were i did that we go to jail uh that that was it wasn't
[2:49:28.440 --> 2:49:36.120]  what martha steward went to jail for she went to jail for line allegedly lying to to the fed but uh
[2:49:36.120 --> 2:49:41.080]  but this this is just outrageous and this was totally rigged economy books totally rigged
[2:49:41.080 --> 2:49:45.480]  economy i want to go out to break one more segment with you on this here is alan greenspan
[2:49:45.480 --> 2:49:51.000]  six seven years ago on lair news hour after he left the fed and Bernanke taken over saying that
[2:49:51.000 --> 2:49:57.320]  they're above the law and congress cannot audit them here dish i have the ideology because i believe
[2:49:57.320 --> 2:50:05.160]  that it is the best way of coming out of the world and what type of policy what is the proper
[2:50:05.160 --> 2:50:09.800]  relationship what should be the proper relationship between the chairman of the fed and a president
[2:50:09.800 --> 2:50:16.840]  of the united states well first of all the federal reserve is an independent agency and that means
[2:50:16.840 --> 2:50:27.560]  basically that uh there is no age other agency of government which can overrule actions that we take
[2:50:27.560 --> 2:50:35.320]  so long is that is in place and there is no evidence that the administration or the congress
[2:50:35.320 --> 2:50:41.080]  or anybody else is requesting that we do things other than what we think is the appropriate thing
[2:50:41.080 --> 2:50:48.440]  then what the relationships are uh don't frankly matter what a stunning statement we're going to
[2:50:48.440 --> 2:50:54.280]  break we're above the law everything's fine as long as we do whatever we want we're government
[2:50:54.280 --> 2:51:00.200]  and no other government can get in our way but they're private on by europeans this is dan billard

[2:54:27.240 --> 2:54:35.800]  that we've for 101 years ought to be 102 years have had a private secret banking consortium
[2:54:35.800 --> 2:54:41.560]  that calls itself the fed as if i show up at your house and i'm in a uniform i said i'm the fed

[2:55:10.200 --> 2:55:15.720]  with elizabeth warren and they protect it and i gotta have stupid a so-called liberal the street
[2:55:15.720 --> 2:55:20.360]  go oh you don't like bernie sanders thought you don't like the fellow reserve i get emails like

[2:55:25.960 --> 2:55:33.320]  elizabeth warren because she's a woman it's just more of the same ignorance that just makes my
[2:55:33.320 --> 2:55:39.560]  blood boil rand paul exposed that they were al-qaeda's air force rand paul exposed ices
[2:55:39.560 --> 2:55:46.760]  ted cruise jumped on board great now you're hearing some of that from donald trump that's good but
[2:55:46.760 --> 2:55:54.600]  regardless of where all this goes it is it is political ignorance of the population that allows
[2:55:54.600 --> 2:56:00.120]  this it is the ocean in which these frauds swim closing comments from norm singleton one of the
[2:56:00.120 --> 2:56:05.800]  brains behind campaign for liberty and ron paul success um in the last few minutes uh what is
[2:56:05.800 --> 2:56:13.240]  your prognosis you feeling good about the future bad or a mix of both uh mix of both i think that uh
[2:56:13.240 --> 2:56:21.640]  as the you know as dr paul likes to say politicians are a lagging indicator on issues uh there's a
[2:56:21.640 --> 2:56:28.280]  growing movement to uh change monetary policy and uh again campaign for liberty campaign for
[2:56:28.280 --> 2:56:35.320]  liberty dot org is uh leading the charge on that uh and i think that uh people as more people wake up
[2:56:35.320 --> 2:56:41.240]  as more people learn the truth uh as campaign for liberty uh and the rest of the liberty movement
[2:56:41.240 --> 2:56:47.400]  grows i think we we could actually change some things hopefully we'll do it before uh there's a
[2:56:47.400 --> 2:56:54.360]  major crash uh and um so i would just uh encourage everyone to go to campaign for liberty dot org

[3:00:49.320 --> 3:00:54.520]  coming up is is jacari in the cockpit in there in the situation room because i want to get his

[3:00:59.960 --> 3:01:05.080]  the war room at the big board and then of course that's a quote from dr strange love and then the
[3:01:05.080 --> 3:01:10.200]  situation room is where the reporters pop in with breaking news where we have extra guests
[3:01:10.200 --> 3:01:13.720]  and where they host the fourth hour part of the time and then we're also building a whole
[3:01:13.720 --> 3:01:19.640]  no studio over on the other side so we can just have more shows more analysis throughout the day
[3:01:19.640 --> 3:01:25.720]  as things break as things unfold but jacari jackson so much happening let's let's go back before we
[3:01:25.720 --> 3:01:31.560]  go to jacari here for just a moment and let's go to that bbc article about the situation in northern
[3:01:31.560 --> 3:01:38.520]  france because i want to go over that for people if we scroll down reports say that a group of armed
[3:01:38.520 --> 3:01:43.080]  men may have taken hostages in the northern french town local media said the incident took
[3:01:43.080 --> 3:01:49.800]  place at around 1900 local time witnesses reported gunshots being fired media reports say the area
[3:01:49.800 --> 3:01:53.960]  has been closed by the off of the police the incident does not appear to be related to the
[3:01:53.960 --> 3:01:59.880]  ongoing security situation in france following the 13th of November paris attacks really you
[3:01:59.880 --> 3:02:04.360]  mean like the army recruiting marine corps attacks those weren't either major assign at fort hood
[3:02:04.360 --> 3:02:08.680]  how do they say that if they don't know anything are they going to blame patriots or something
[3:02:08.680 --> 3:02:13.480]  and blame right wing french i mean i'm really looking for that jacari jackson things are crazy i
[3:02:13.480 --> 3:02:18.520]  want to hear what you've got coming up and i want your view on the shoot down of this russian plane
[3:02:18.520 --> 3:02:24.840]  and then blowing up the helicopter inside syria with a us made to missile i mean i guess turkey
[3:02:24.840 --> 3:02:29.320]  and the the nato and the crazy people run our government i guess they really want to get no
[3:02:29.320 --> 3:02:35.080]  war with russia jacari well it does seem like that is the case we have a clip coming up of john mccain
[3:02:35.080 --> 3:02:39.000]  talking about how great it would be for russian planes to be shot down this is a statement that he
[3:02:39.000 --> 3:02:43.720]  made a little bit ago before this most recent i forgot about that why didn't you come remind me
[3:02:43.720 --> 3:02:48.280]  you guys absolutely i forgot about that well give points to darin mcbrain for that when he has the
[3:02:48.280 --> 3:02:53.480]  clip ready and we'll play that coming up here in just one moment but yeah we have also the report
[3:02:53.480 --> 3:02:58.520]  from paul joseph watson is going to air later on the russian jet shoot down what they're not telling
[3:02:58.520 --> 3:03:03.480]  you and in that report paul breaks down all the facets of it telling you how you know they say
[3:03:03.480 --> 3:03:08.200]  that they entered this the airspace over there in turkey but you know it wasn't for that long of a
[3:03:08.200 --> 3:03:12.360]  time so why would you want to jump the gun we also have the article on the site as well saying
[3:03:12.920 --> 3:03:18.440]  the turkey saying the years prior that you know a temporary infraction does not institute some
[3:03:18.440 --> 3:03:24.840]  type of shoot down so it's uh it's a very sticky situation but also we definitely don't want anything
[3:03:24.840 --> 3:03:29.960]  that's going to launch us into a war or any type of nation into why are you being discriminatory
[3:03:29.960 --> 3:03:34.360]  against world war four nuclear war i mean maybe nuclear war has a right maybe nuclear weapons
[3:03:34.360 --> 3:03:38.600]  have a right to detonate and be free well i'm sure they wanted to launch those nukes alexa i'm sure
[3:03:38.600 --> 3:03:42.920]  they've wanted to do that for a very long time but it's not just something bad for us it's bad for
[3:03:42.920 --> 3:03:46.840]  the whole world you know you have different estimates from different people but all of the
[3:03:46.840 --> 3:03:50.360]  countries or not all the countries but enough countries around the world have enough to pretty
[3:03:50.360 --> 3:03:54.760]  must blow up the planet and that's definitely not a situation that you want to get into why not
[3:03:54.760 --> 3:03:59.560]  blow up the planet why are you why are you being discriminatory against that well i'm sure martians
[3:03:59.560 --> 3:04:04.440]  or other people who may be out there would love to see us blow ourselves to bits i'm not one of
[3:04:04.440 --> 3:04:09.320]  those people alexa i'd like to live here on this planet a little bit longer so you're pro human
[3:04:09.320 --> 3:04:13.880]  jakari how horrible you're actually just you just care about the planet and and care about people in

[3:04:18.520 --> 3:04:23.560]  what i try to be alexa i try to care for people around the world and here in my own country as
[3:04:23.560 --> 3:04:27.560]  well well that's why they call you an extremist because you work for info wars and you just don't
[3:04:27.560 --> 3:04:30.840]  want to have nuclear war and you want to have freedom and keep more of your tax money have a
[3:04:30.840 --> 3:04:34.200]  right to defend yourself and you're you're a horrible person and your christian which makes

[3:05:11.960 --> 3:05:16.840]  the australian government over 500 million dollars over four years and how many children are not
[3:05:16.840 --> 3:05:23.640]  receiving their vaccines according to the australian childhood immunization register it's 1.77 percent
[3:05:23.640 --> 3:05:28.120]  i thought all you needed was 90 percent to have heard immunity the government believes that by
[3:05:28.120 --> 3:05:32.200]  removing the non-medical exemption it will reinforce the importance of immunization and
[3:05:32.200 --> 3:05:36.280]  protecting public health but what this is really about is the government wants to put anything in

[3:08:12.680 --> 3:08:18.360]  and welcome back to the alex jones show this is the info wars overdrive hour i will be your host
[3:08:18.360 --> 3:08:23.560]  jakari jackson now of course we're going to talk about the rush of situation the uh the jet has
[3:08:23.560 --> 3:08:28.520]  recently been shot down but first so right before we began our segment they ran in here and they
[3:08:28.520 --> 3:08:33.960]  gave me this article talking about the hostage situation that is going on in a northern french
[3:08:33.960 --> 3:08:38.840]  town now at this point they're saying that they have no reason to believe it's connected to the
[3:08:38.840 --> 3:08:45.160]  previous terror attacks that we've seen in the area recently that may be true but it wouldn't
[3:08:45.160 --> 3:08:51.160]  i wouldn't put past these crazy terrorists to go into a different part of the area and try to kick
[3:08:51.160 --> 3:08:57.320]  up some stuff and it says local news says the incident began around 1900 local time when this
[3:08:57.320 --> 3:09:03.640]  is reported gunshots being fired media reports say the area has been closed off by the police so
[3:09:03.640 --> 3:09:10.360]  well definitely keeps you updated as that situation continues to grow now let's talk about the
[3:09:10.360 --> 3:09:15.000]  situation that's going on with this russian jet that has been shot down i have this article here
[3:09:15.000 --> 3:09:20.600]  searing rebels chant aloo akbar over body of dead russian pilot after turkey shoots down
[3:09:20.600 --> 3:09:26.120]  jet for violating its airspace and it says the russian jet had violated turkish airspace and
[3:09:26.120 --> 3:09:32.520]  ignored 10 warnings in five minutes says the military and one pilot is dead and another has
[3:09:32.520 --> 3:09:38.840]  reportedly been captured now the issue about this is is uh as you'll see in the paul joseph watching
[3:09:38.840 --> 3:09:44.520]  peace that's going to air in our next segment uh as one of the pilots ejected they were shooting
[3:09:44.520 --> 3:09:49.640]  at him as he was coming towards the ground and i don't mean pop shots i mean they were shooting
[3:09:49.640 --> 3:09:56.440]  fully automatic ak-47s at this guy they wanted him dead so it's it's a very sticky situation and
[3:09:56.440 --> 3:10:00.840]  something that could potentially lead to a much larger conflict of course we don't want to see
[3:10:00.840 --> 3:10:07.800]  that but you know not everything is within our hands to control now as that relates to the world
[3:10:07.800 --> 3:10:13.320]  at large we've seen all these terror attacks and calls to be safe around terrorism and now we have
[3:10:13.320 --> 3:10:18.840]  this special report this article on info wars dot com state department issues travel advisory for the
[3:10:18.840 --> 3:10:24.680]  entire planet and we just saw another attack going on in france and now they're saying the whole world
[3:10:24.680 --> 3:10:29.720]  is pretty much a danger zone flying into the danger zone the government has issued terror
[3:10:29.720 --> 3:10:35.640]  warnings for every holiday since september 11th 2001 it is particularly fond of frightening
[3:10:35.640 --> 3:10:41.160]  people around thanksgiving and christmas and this year is no exception the state department alerts
[3:10:41.160 --> 3:10:47.080]  us citizens to possible risk of travel due to increased terrorism threats current information
[3:10:47.080 --> 3:10:53.160]  suggests that isle al qaeda boko haram and other terrorist groups continue to plan terrorist attacks
[3:10:53.160 --> 3:10:59.480]  in multiple regions these attacks may employ a wide variety wide variety of tactics using
[3:10:59.480 --> 3:11:04.280]  conventional and non-conventional weapons and targeting both official and private interest
[3:11:04.280 --> 3:11:08.440]  which is to say that you're pretty much a target or potential target anywhere you go this is what
[3:11:08.440 --> 3:11:16.760]  the state department is saying and this travel alert expires on february 24th 2016 so you don't
[3:11:16.760 --> 3:11:22.600]  just have a month or a week or a day you have a terror alert for the next few months uh because
[3:11:22.600 --> 3:11:27.240]  they want you to pretty much see something and say something and of course if you were to be in
[3:11:27.240 --> 3:11:30.920]  some type of situation you definitely want to alert the proper authorities if you're in some
[3:11:30.920 --> 3:11:38.520]  theater and you the guy has a gun under his coat or whatever but it's also this uh the sense of
[3:11:38.520 --> 3:11:43.560]  constant fear you know the you guys seen the terror scare the scale uh the red the green the blue
[3:11:43.560 --> 3:11:48.280]  whatever the terror alert may be that day and they really want you to be in a constant state of
[3:11:48.280 --> 3:11:53.800]  fear a constant state of wanting them to swoop in and save you but things are slightly looking up
[3:11:53.800 --> 3:11:58.360]  because we see that more and more police chiefs are actually telling people to arm themselves in
[3:11:58.360 --> 3:12:03.720]  their area of course we've seen previously the milwaukee sheriff david clark say you guys need
[3:12:03.720 --> 3:12:08.040]  to take the means to protect yourself i believe they said something similar up in detroit as well
[3:12:08.040 --> 3:12:13.640]  and now the dc police chief is urging citizens to fight back against peristyle attackers and this
[3:12:13.640 --> 3:12:18.600]  is actually the uh police chief if i'm not mistaken who oversaw the arrest of adam kokesh
[3:12:18.600 --> 3:12:24.280]  when he cocked a shotgun i guess i was two years ago now and citizens in the nation's capital should
[3:12:24.280 --> 3:12:30.760]  be prepared to fight and try to take a gunman out should peristyle scenarios unfold prior to police
[3:12:30.760 --> 3:12:36.760]  arriving the city's police chief has stated and this is a statement she made while talking to 60
[3:12:36.760 --> 3:12:41.240]  minutes this past weekend and i'm very happy to hear more police chiefs encouraging their
[3:12:41.240 --> 3:12:47.160]  citizens to be armed to take measures into their own hands actual measures because we've seen
[3:12:47.160 --> 3:12:53.240]  previously if you in if you're in some type of situation they say uh use a stapler or hide or
[3:12:53.240 --> 3:12:57.480]  throw cans that's what i tell the kids at school hide under your desk and throw you know Campbell
[3:12:57.480 --> 3:13:04.120]  soup at the guy when he comes in with the ak-47 not arm the teachers or do some other means to
[3:13:04.120 --> 3:13:08.760]  to protect the children no they want the kids to throw canned goods instead of having teachers
[3:13:08.760 --> 3:13:14.040]  armed like they are in i think it's herald isd in northern texas where they have a very strict
[3:13:14.040 --> 3:13:18.120]  procedure they make the teachers qualify every month with the pistols and i think it's a great
[3:13:18.120 --> 3:13:23.480]  plan because as the superintendent told me they are their first responders they can't wait you
[3:13:23.480 --> 3:13:28.040]  know 45 minutes for a deputy to get there they have to have the means to protect yourself and
[3:13:28.040 --> 3:13:32.920]  it's not just there any place in the world you go whether it's in your home your business if you're
[3:13:32.920 --> 3:13:37.320]  out shopping you are the first responder you know because as great as the cops may be with
[3:13:37.320 --> 3:13:41.720]  well intention as they may be they can't be there to protect you all the time and even if they do
[3:13:41.720 --> 3:13:46.360]  arrive on the scene in a rapid fashion well who's the bad guy where'd he go did he tuck his gun in
[3:13:46.360 --> 3:13:50.440]  his coat did he walk out the back door they don't know all these things and anybody there is a
[3:13:50.440 --> 3:13:55.480]  potential threat to them so you definitely want to at least have the means to identify the guy and
[3:13:55.480 --> 3:13:59.240]  maybe take a shot at him if you can and it doesn't mean that everybody's going to be packing and
[3:13:59.240 --> 3:14:03.240]  there's going to be bullets flying everywhere because we saw the shooting uh believes at a mall
[3:14:04.200 --> 3:14:09.400]  gum and walks in and a guy just pulls out is uh his Glock he aims at the guy and the guy shot
[3:14:09.400 --> 3:14:14.680]  himself he didn't even have to fire a shot the the good guy with the gun so that's just uh a small
[3:14:14.680 --> 3:14:18.520]  smattering of what's going on today now as we're talking about guns we're going to talk about a
[3:14:18.520 --> 3:14:23.720]  shooting that happened in Chicago last year Chicago cop charged with murder for shooting black
[3:14:23.720 --> 3:14:28.760]  teens 16 times it's not because he's black i mean because i i i guess that's a new thing they always
[3:14:28.760 --> 3:14:33.480]  want to say the race of the victim or the race of the cop who did the shooting you know i care just
[3:14:33.480 --> 3:14:38.360]  as much about kelly thomas who's a white guy got beat to death out in california or the kid a
[3:14:38.360 --> 3:14:43.800]  hispanic kid who got beat here in austin or tased here in austin he broke up a fight i believe in
[3:14:43.800 --> 3:14:50.280]  bass drop uh the cops tase him he falls down splits his wig and then the cops they always justify
[3:14:50.280 --> 3:14:54.600]  we have it on camera even though the camera clearly shows that they were in the wrong now we have
[3:14:54.600 --> 3:15:00.920]  another situation of a cop shooting a guy 16 times and they haven't released the video so i can't
[3:15:00.920 --> 3:15:07.960]  really talk too much about it but basically it's a he said she said situation and 16 times seems
[3:15:07.960 --> 3:15:14.280]  quite excessive uh like i said i i had to see the video to know for sure but 16 times sounds like a
[3:15:14.280 --> 3:15:19.320]  lot of times to shoot a guy uh witnesses say that the guy didn't approach the officer they say he
[3:15:19.320 --> 3:15:23.000]  had a knife but uh witnesses were saying that the guy was walking away at the time he was shot of
[3:15:23.000 --> 3:15:28.600]  course the officers say he was charging them like a raging bull so we'll just have to wait to see
[3:15:28.600 --> 3:15:34.440]  how this thing unfolds now something that we reported on earlier this year the uh the situation
[3:15:34.440 --> 3:15:39.880]  that's going on with plan parenthood in particular here in texas they have a very strong campaign
[3:15:39.880 --> 3:15:47.160]  to defund plan parenthood and now plan parenthood is suing texas over threat to cut medicaid funding
[3:15:47.160 --> 3:15:52.120]  now i've been to a lot of these rallies pro-abortion anti-abortion because i don't just go to rallies
[3:15:52.120 --> 3:15:56.920]  of stuff i agree with you know i've been to anti-gun rallies and i try to talk to people and understand
[3:15:56.920 --> 3:16:01.800]  why they feel the way they feel and now we see plan parenthood and other women's health providers
[3:16:02.360 --> 3:16:08.200]  in groups of women in need of reproductive health care sued texas on monday seeking to halt its
[3:16:08.200 --> 3:16:13.640]  threatening to cut medicaid funding a move they said was more about politics than health care
[3:16:14.600 --> 3:16:20.040]  my issue with this is plan parenthood i meet people all the time they say plan parenthood
[3:16:20.040 --> 3:16:24.440]  what's it three percent or whatever number they throw out only three percent of their care goes
[3:16:24.440 --> 3:16:28.280]  towards abortion and as reverend children's pointed out to me he said he would like to
[3:16:28.280 --> 3:16:32.280]  check the books and i would like to too because they can tell you anything like well it's only
[3:16:32.280 --> 3:16:36.680]  three percent how do we know do they have an independent auditor going there and uh check
[3:16:36.680 --> 3:16:42.760]  the books on these things but beyond that even if it is three percent it's three percent if they
[3:16:42.760 --> 3:16:47.400]  just eliminate that three percent ninety seven percent of the people who protest outside plan
[3:16:47.400 --> 3:16:51.560]  parenthood will disappear overnight you never see from them again because that's their issue it's
[3:16:51.560 --> 3:16:57.400]  abortion they don't want their taxpayers going to kill children it always makes me laugh these
[3:16:57.400 --> 3:17:02.360]  people with these ideologies let's ban this let's ban that to keep the kids safe but they won't ban
[3:17:02.360 --> 3:17:06.520]  abortion to keep the kids safe they want to ban you know drunk driving and guns and all this other
[3:17:06.520 --> 3:17:11.400]  stuff and of course i'm not supporting drunk driving but they don't want to ban abortion to
[3:17:11.400 --> 3:17:15.720]  keep the kids safe in the womb meanwhile they'll come out with all types of other measures and
[3:17:15.720 --> 3:17:20.280]  uh scream hell satan and throw mallets off cocktails and those are things that just happened here in
[3:17:20.280 --> 3:17:25.400]  the city of austin texas so you know it's it's not something that i supported all supporting
[3:17:25.400 --> 3:17:31.640]  plan parenthood that that is i think it's a rather wicked organization founded by a rather
[3:17:31.640 --> 3:17:35.640]  wicked woman and i don't want anything to do with it and i definitely don't want my taxpayer
[3:17:35.640 --> 3:17:39.640]  dollars going towards it because i've run into people they have these signs here in texas i don't
[3:17:39.640 --> 3:17:44.520]  know about your state but they have these signs they say like keep your prayers out of my vagina
[3:17:44.520 --> 3:17:50.440]  and they have like a uterus and it says come and take it on it and my deal about that is if you
[3:17:50.440 --> 3:17:55.800]  don't want my prayers and your uterus keep your vagina out of my tax dollars or keep my tax dollars
[3:17:55.800 --> 3:18:00.520]  out of your vagina because you guys are saying that you want me to pay for all this stuff meanwhile
[3:18:00.520 --> 3:18:04.920]  you don't want me to have any say in how the money is used at all i'm like no i'm not giving you a
[3:18:04.920 --> 3:18:10.120]  blank check to go chop up babies and talk about how you want to buy lambos with them now i've i've
[3:18:10.120 --> 3:18:14.440]  met various people they say well it's not all about you know some person who just wants to get
[3:18:14.440 --> 3:18:20.360]  abortion just because they have people who have medical issues or whatever else and you know i feel
[3:18:20.360 --> 3:18:24.760]  sorry for those people but at the same time i'm not trying to pay for somebody who just wants to
[3:18:24.760 --> 3:18:30.520]  get rid of their baby because it's an inconvenience to them now before we go into more special reports
[3:18:30.520 --> 3:18:35.720]  in our other breaks i want to come to this report now we've shown you the articles and
[3:18:35.720 --> 3:18:41.080]  documents about teenagers and other people who go and join isis or al-qaeda for a weekend they think
[3:18:41.080 --> 3:18:45.880]  it's like going to summer camp or something so they go out there they join isis or these terrorist
[3:18:45.880 --> 3:18:49.880]  organizations and then they can't leave and they end up dead because they want to leave and this is
[3:18:49.880 --> 3:18:56.280]  one such case a teenage islamic poster girl who fled austria to join isis is beaten to death
[3:18:56.280 --> 3:19:01.240]  by the terror group after trying to escape from syria and as people point out they're out there
[3:19:01.240 --> 3:19:06.680]  shooting people who look like them people who are from their region and all this other stuff so when
[3:19:06.680 --> 3:19:12.040]  you show up say hey i'm out here what's up bro you want to go you know play hacky sack after we kill
[3:19:12.040 --> 3:19:16.200]  some christians are like no bro we're going to beat you to death or young lady we're going to beat
[3:19:16.200 --> 3:19:21.640]  you to death it's a very sad situation but at the same time i just don't get the cult of personality
[3:19:21.640 --> 3:19:27.080]  that attracts people to want to join a group like isis not saying that everything everybody else does
[3:19:27.080 --> 3:19:32.600]  is good and and awesome because i can tell you many things are wrong with our own us government
[3:19:32.600 --> 3:19:36.120]  but to go out and join a group like this when they're killing christians chopping people's
[3:19:36.120 --> 3:19:41.400]  heads off throwing people off buildings ripping people's vital organs out and all these other
[3:19:41.400 --> 3:19:45.160]  things it's just not a good luck so stay tuned we'll come back right after this break with a

[3:25:14.440 --> 3:25:19.720]  shootdown here's what they're not telling you about the turkish shootdown of the russian fighter jet
[3:25:19.720 --> 3:25:26.360]  days before the incident turkey warned russia that if they didn't stop bombing isis there would be
[3:25:26.360 --> 3:25:34.280]  quote serious consequences and car a threatened mosca with retaliation if it didn't quote immediately
[3:25:34.280 --> 3:25:41.960]  end its operation against isis putin responded to the shootdown of the jet by labeling it a stab in
[3:25:41.960 --> 3:25:48.440]  the back by accomplices of terrorism and he's right turkey has been supporting arming and
[3:25:48.440 --> 3:25:57.240]  financing isis for years turkey is a state sponsor of terrorism turkey shot down the russian jet
[3:25:57.240 --> 3:26:04.200]  because it's but hurt that russia has been obliterating isis for the past two months turkey has
[3:26:04.200 --> 3:26:11.080]  aligned with jihadists so-called moderate rebels who aren't moderate as well as al-qaeda groups and
[3:26:11.080 --> 3:26:18.360]  isis in an effort to topple bashar al-sad a secular leader who is trying to fight against islamic
[3:26:18.360 --> 3:26:27.160]  extremism turkey is a corrupt jihadist whole whose soccer fans booed the victims of the paris massacre
[3:26:27.160 --> 3:26:41.480]  for years turkey has been buying and facilitating the sale of isis's stolen oil supplies on the
[3:26:41.480 --> 3:26:49.800]  black market 800 million dollars worth of isis oil has been sold in turkey a supposed us ally
[3:26:50.840 --> 3:26:55.640]  isis trucks are routinely allowed to cross back and forth between the islamic state stronghold
[3:26:55.640 --> 3:27:02.120]  of wrecker and turkey documents recovered from the raid on an isis safehouse this past summer
[3:27:02.120 --> 3:27:07.960]  confirmed that quote direct dealings between turkish officials and ranking isis members
[3:27:07.960 --> 3:27:14.760]  was now undeniable a former isis communications technician told newsweek that his job was to
[3:27:14.760 --> 3:27:22.440]  quote connect isis field captains and commanders from syria with people in turkey on innumerable
[3:27:22.440 --> 3:27:28.920]  occasions isis commanders told us to fear nothing at all because there was full cooperation with
[3:27:28.920 --> 3:27:34.760]  the turks he said a jordan security official revealed that isis jihadists had received
[3:27:34.760 --> 3:27:40.360]  training from turkey an egyptian security official revealed that turkey is providing
[3:27:40.360 --> 3:27:47.880]  direct intelligence and logistical support to isis turkey is also bombing and killing Kurdish
[3:27:47.880 --> 3:27:54.360]  separatists one of the primary groups in the region fighting against isis we don't know for
[3:27:54.360 --> 3:28:00.280]  sure whether the russian jet even crossed into turkish airspace russia claims it was four kilometers
[3:28:00.280 --> 3:28:07.240]  within syrian territory but as observers have noted even if the jet did violate turkish airspace
[3:28:07.240 --> 3:28:13.320]  it could only have been for a matter of seconds the fact that turkey massively overreacted and
[3:28:13.320 --> 3:28:20.440]  shot down the fighter jet proves what an irrational threat erdogan poses to the region video has also
[3:28:20.440 --> 3:28:26.680]  emerged of the so-called moderate rebels who aren't moderate shooting at the russian jet pilot as he
[3:28:26.680 --> 3:28:44.920]  descends to the ground while chanting a la akbar by not cancelling turkey's membership nato is
[3:28:44.920 --> 3:28:53.800]  harboring a state sponsor of isis but like turkey nato and the us don't want to eliminate isis in
[3:28:53.800 --> 3:29:01.640]  the region they foresaw the rise of isis as a useful tool with which to destabilize and isolate
[3:29:01.640 --> 3:29:09.800]  bashar elisad the us waited 15 months before targeting isis's oil infrastructure which funds
[3:29:09.800 --> 3:29:17.320]  over half of its operations thanks to the us nato and turkey attempting to stop russia from
[3:29:17.320 --> 3:29:25.640]  destroying isis the islamic state will continue to wreak havoc across both the middle east and europe

[3:30:25.800 --> 3:30:30.680]  heard immunity the government believes that by removing the non-medical exemption it will reinforce
[3:30:30.680 --> 3:30:34.840]  the importance of immunization and protecting public health but what this is really about is
[3:30:34.840 --> 3:30:38.840]  the government wants to put anything in your body that they want and they want to make sure you

[3:33:06.280 --> 3:33:16.280]  war on for your mind and welcome back to the alex jones show i'm your host jacari jackson on this
[3:33:16.280 --> 3:33:21.560]  info wars overdrive segment now at the beginning of our hour we were talking to alex jones about
[3:33:21.560 --> 3:33:26.600]  john mccain and all the crazy things he's done we've seen him overseas hanging out with the
[3:33:26.600 --> 3:33:31.000]  syrian rebels aka the al-qaeda rebels talking about i know these guys and then people say well
[3:33:31.000 --> 3:33:34.280]  hold on are you hanging out with these seriously oh i don't i don't know anything about that but
[3:33:34.280 --> 3:33:38.920]  you just said you know him anyway he does all that crazy stuff now here's a throwback clip of him
[3:33:38.920 --> 3:33:44.920]  saying how much you'd love to see russian flights or russian jets shot down we need to have no
[3:33:44.920 --> 3:33:50.200]  flies on we need to have a buffer zone for refugees we need to provide no i know that center but if
[3:33:50.200 --> 3:33:57.560]  they are attacking the very guys who we want to see topple aside you you would let american planes
[3:33:57.560 --> 3:34:03.320]  just to pass them and let them do that no but i might do what we did in afghanistan many years
[3:34:03.320 --> 3:34:09.000]  ago to give those guys the ability to shoot out those planes that that equipment is available
[3:34:10.280 --> 3:34:16.120]  who would be shooting him down the free syrian army just yeah his buddy is the free syrian army
[3:34:16.120 --> 3:34:21.720]  aka the al-qaeda rebels uh as paul jewells of watson has documented numerous times many of these
[3:34:21.720 --> 3:34:26.360]  people aren't even syrian they're just proxies that they continually move around so you can find
[3:34:26.360 --> 3:34:29.960]  all those clips i believe david's going to be talking about that more on the info wars nightly
[3:34:29.960 --> 3:34:34.920]  news tonight but now let's talk about hillary because you guys know mrs clinton she has come
[3:34:34.920 --> 3:34:39.800]  out against the laugh factory a group of comedians for dare making fun of her even though you can
[3:34:39.800 --> 3:34:44.920]  turn on saturday night live or any late night talk show and they make fun of all manner of politicians
[3:34:44.920 --> 3:34:49.720]  it's not something that's directly related to her and now she's cracking down on free speech
[3:34:49.720 --> 3:34:54.840]  now a couple weeks ago myself kid daniels and uh and michael zimmerman had a chance to go to mizu
[3:34:54.840 --> 3:35:00.280]  and one of the most refreshing things about that trip was meeting a group of young libertarians
[3:35:00.280 --> 3:35:04.760]  who had a free speech wall and the wall was just as it implies it was a free speech wall
[3:35:04.760 --> 3:35:08.200]  you could walk up you could write anything you wanted on it they did not censor you they did
[3:35:08.200 --> 3:35:13.160]  not suggest anything that you say you just wrote whatever you felt like and it was a true expression
[3:35:13.160 --> 3:35:18.680]  of free speech some people's speech was political some people's was not but regardless they exercise
[3:35:18.680 --> 3:35:23.240]  their free speech so before we go to this video about hillary and all the things you can do to
[3:35:23.240 --> 3:35:28.360]  get involved in uh pretty much fight her tyranny i want to give the number out so after the video
[3:35:28.360 --> 3:35:36.280]  is concluded we can take a few calls and the time we have left the number to call in is 1-800-259-9231
[3:35:36.280 --> 3:35:43.800]  once again the number is 1-800-259-9231 let's take a look at this video the national contest
[3:35:43.800 --> 3:35:49.560]  to stop hillary's attack on free speech ladies and gentlemen we are back thank you so much
[3:35:49.560 --> 3:35:55.240]  for joining us now we've seen a lot of attacks on free speech and everybody knows that i was
[3:35:55.240 --> 3:36:00.440]  against the republicans trying to put you know parental warnings on music because it's up to
[3:36:00.440 --> 3:36:04.280]  parents to decide what their kids listen to and what they watch the government shouldn't be involved
[3:36:04.280 --> 3:36:10.040]  and we always said that could lead to censorship i am not partisan about this i'm a libertarian
[3:36:10.760 --> 3:36:17.800]  but man the democrats have gone like a thousand light years worse trying to ban the terms
[3:36:17.800 --> 3:36:23.880]  mother and father or boy or girl because it might hurt a transgendered person whoever said that
[3:36:23.880 --> 3:36:29.480]  jerry seinfeld and others have come out and said they won't even go to colleges and do their comedy
[3:36:29.480 --> 3:36:37.320]  routine because people flip out on them we have seen so many cases of this where political correctness
[3:36:37.320 --> 3:36:43.720]  has become a serious tyranny in this nation and it's been directed not just in the united states
[3:36:43.720 --> 3:36:49.320]  but in europe as well where if you criticize open borders from syria with all these militants coming
[3:36:49.320 --> 3:36:56.120]  in and blowing stuff up facebook is shutting you down the police are even raiding people's houses
[3:36:56.120 --> 3:37:03.080]  for their speech and now hillary clinton has sent her campaign and had high-level campaign
[3:37:03.080 --> 3:37:12.120]  officials call the laugh factory undoubtedly the most famous comedy hall comedy club in the world
[3:37:12.120 --> 3:37:17.720]  i mean you name it so many of the greats have come from there speaking of you know jerry seinfeld
[3:37:17.720 --> 3:37:21.640]  his own daughter showed up this year and they said we're moving back to new york so you can see more
[3:37:21.640 --> 3:37:28.120]  boys she's 14 she said dad boys and girls together sexist just the word boy and girl is sexist this
[3:37:28.120 --> 3:37:34.600]  is by design hillary has had her campaign threatened to quote bankrupt them shut them down you've got
[3:37:34.600 --> 3:37:39.800]  to read these articles hillary clinton's laugh factory threats why did her campaign want comedians
[3:37:39.800 --> 3:37:47.320]  personal contact information so they could threaten them this is the reality of what's
[3:37:47.320 --> 3:37:53.720]  going on and it's getting worse and worse and worse and if they could shut down comedy they
[3:37:53.720 --> 3:37:58.600]  could shut down any free speech going back thousands of years ago in medieval europe or even rome
[3:37:59.320 --> 3:38:05.160]  the person that had the most free speech other than the king was the gesture because they could
[3:38:05.160 --> 3:38:12.520]  say things nobody else was allowed to uh musicians would go around and play their play their three
[3:38:12.520 --> 3:38:18.040]  string uh instruments would also have ballots against corruption this goes back to the time of
[3:38:18.040 --> 3:38:25.800]  robin hood but now hillary clinton across the board has said that bernie sanders is sexist
[3:38:26.600 --> 3:38:34.360]  because bernie sanders has criticized her this is the insanity so i don't care if you're left
[3:38:34.360 --> 3:38:41.000]  right center libertarian black white jewish german chinese mexican or purple everyone
[3:38:41.000 --> 3:38:47.000]  should see this as a major threat because they are intimidating tv shows writers you name it
[3:38:47.000 --> 3:38:52.760]  to self censor to control what they're saying and this is the greatest attack i've ever seen on
[3:38:52.760 --> 3:38:59.160]  free speech this is 21st century book burning in fact i want to go live and and walk around some
[3:38:59.160 --> 3:39:04.200]  of the studio and talk about this crap with people because i personally i personally have had enough
[3:39:04.200 --> 3:39:09.560]  of this i have made it my business to make fun of politicians i've made it my business too
[3:39:09.560 --> 3:39:14.920]  to criticize them and basically call them frauds when bush lied about iraq and wmds i called him
[3:39:14.920 --> 3:39:21.320]  a piece of crap i mean we got him right here as the joker he's a clown will i get shut down will
[3:39:21.320 --> 3:39:26.280]  i get arrested for this i mean if i want to throw darts at a picture hillary clinton it's my right
[3:39:26.280 --> 3:39:31.080]  as an american and as a free person to do it i mean here's barack obama right here i got him as
[3:39:31.080 --> 3:39:36.040]  a clown is that okay with you it's about being able to make fun of who you want as long as you
[3:39:36.040 --> 3:39:43.400]  don't hurt somebody else okay i mean look at this crap look at this people make fun of democratic
[3:39:43.400 --> 3:39:48.360]  party political cartoons you'll call a bunch of jackasses call republicans elephants that's what
[3:39:48.360 --> 3:39:54.280]  it's all about we have unmasked hillary clinton and if we want to call her a lying demonic corporate
[3:39:54.280 --> 3:39:59.320]  witch who helped give the banks unlimited banker bailout money then you know what we can do it you
[3:39:59.320 --> 3:40:05.320]  got that hillary we're sick of your crap free speech needs to be protected in this nation
[3:40:05.320 --> 3:40:09.720]  if we want to talk about about the lord the savior barack obama bought and paid for by crony
[3:40:09.720 --> 3:40:14.520]  capitalist we're gonna do it we're gonna do it all we want and we don't want any harm to come to
[3:40:14.520 --> 3:40:19.080]  obama that make him a martyr but we're gonna destroy his name and what he stands for and the
[3:40:19.080 --> 3:40:24.040]  frauds he pushes in fact let's go talk to some more of the crew i don't know where i'm going with
[3:40:24.040 --> 3:40:28.840]  this other than the fact we're gonna resist it and that's what this comes down to if you're sick of
[3:40:28.840 --> 3:40:35.080]  this crap then take action yourself and engage in the first amendment and free speech we're announcing
[3:40:35.080 --> 3:40:40.360]  a five thousand dollar contest that runs until december 21st you've got a month to produce a
[3:40:40.360 --> 3:40:47.000]  video and upload it on youtube and one other platform where you make fun of hillary clinton
[3:40:47.000 --> 3:40:52.200]  and her policies or how she looks or what she stands for or any of it the truth is with the
[3:40:52.200 --> 3:40:57.240]  new media the system can't control everybody he wants to have select comedy on comedy central
[3:40:57.240 --> 3:41:02.760]  with john stewart you know with his fake liberal garbage or with people on saturday night live
[3:41:02.760 --> 3:41:08.680]  but that no one else can engage in it because the political bosses uh will intimidate you
[3:41:08.680 --> 3:41:12.760]  and that's because they know hillary is a joke and she personally it's been documented can't
[3:41:12.760 --> 3:41:17.320]  handle criticism well she certainly shouldn't be president i've been made fun of all over
[3:41:17.320 --> 3:41:21.800]  comedy central i've been made fun of all over i love it because people will come find the real me
[3:41:22.600 --> 3:41:29.320]  and i will fight to the death for their right on comedy central and bill marr on hbo to make
[3:41:29.320 --> 3:41:33.880]  statements about me that aren't true to make statements about me saying alex jones thinks
[3:41:33.880 --> 3:41:40.280]  cancer is good for you wasn't true but i can now counter them they're desperate let's see
[3:41:40.840 --> 3:41:45.880]  they want to restrict what i have to say if the left doesn't stand up to this if the right
[3:41:45.880 --> 3:41:50.520]  doesn't stand up to this with the persecution of the tea party the persecution with the irs of
[3:41:50.520 --> 3:41:53.960]  christian organizations and veterans groups and gun groups we're going to lose it all
[3:41:53.960 --> 3:41:58.600]  if they would have arrested michael more for his documentary i would have come out against it
[3:41:59.480 --> 3:42:04.120]  i would have stood for him but my right so there's the report who served by alex jones now i want
[3:42:04.120 --> 3:42:08.200]  to redirect you guys to the actual site so you can get all the information you need be sure to
[3:42:08.200 --> 3:42:13.640]  follow the contest rules it is national contest to stop hillary's attack on free speech you can
[3:42:13.640 --> 3:42:19.000]  shoot a video making fun of hillary and there are six thousand dollars in cash prizes now as i was
[3:42:19.000 --> 3:42:23.160]  saying if you scroll down you can see all the contest rules the official rules make sure you
[3:42:23.160 --> 3:42:28.520]  follow all the rules so you can be official in the contest we have got a few entries in i was
[3:42:28.520 --> 3:42:33.080]  looking at one earlier we can't really play it because it's called hillary is called a uh
[3:42:33.080 --> 3:42:40.440]  or hillary is a uh female dog to put it lightly so uh not all of them have to be uh that abrasive you
[3:42:40.440 --> 3:42:44.760]  can do something a little more lighthearted but regardless uh get in the game and uh go ahead
[3:42:44.760 --> 3:42:50.040]  and put your entry out there let's go ahead and take a few calls we have robert in connecticut
[3:42:50.040 --> 3:42:59.480]  go ahead robert yes i am how you doing today hey uh yeah hillary clinton she's out of control
[3:43:00.440 --> 3:43:06.600]  i'm just waiting for her to be indicted because uh uh something's gotta happen here what she's
[3:43:06.600 --> 3:43:12.600]  done as secretary of state what she did as first lady what she did as first lady in
[3:43:12.600 --> 3:43:19.880]  arkansas with bill uh her crimes are uh they're they're piling up and and there's no
[3:43:19.880 --> 3:43:25.720]  accountability for them what's the deal well i was talking to larry nickle is the clinton
[3:43:25.720 --> 3:43:30.200]  insider and i asked him the same question i said why are they focusing so hard on the emails instead
[3:43:30.200 --> 3:43:36.040]  of something like bengasi and he was like well bengasi affects a lot of people outside of hillary
[3:43:36.040 --> 3:43:40.920]  as opposed to they could just focus on the email scandal they can really go after her and target
[3:43:40.920 --> 3:43:45.560]  her he also went a step further and he said uh you know having worked in the clinton machine he
[3:43:45.560 --> 3:43:50.440]  said if he was running hillary's campaign this is exactly how he'd be running it he says clinton
[3:43:50.440 --> 3:43:55.640]  has to run as an underdog in order to win so then you know next year or few months from now whatever
[3:43:55.640 --> 3:43:59.880]  it may be they come out and they say oh look how they attacked her from all sides they did this
[3:43:59.880 --> 3:44:04.040]  and they said that about her but she has risen like a phoenix and she has beaten all these charges
[3:44:04.040 --> 3:44:09.960]  all these false allegations that they'll try to uh so try to spin it and basically uh that's how
[3:44:09.960 --> 3:44:14.120]  they'll run her now whether or not she'll be president i don't really know but that's pretty
[3:44:14.120 --> 3:44:19.080]  much the strategy thus i understand it thank you so much for your call robert let's move on now to
[3:44:19.080 --> 3:44:27.400]  josh in tennessee you want to talk about trump and ben carson hey how you doing i'm doing good
[3:44:27.400 --> 3:44:31.240]  i just wanted to say you've been doing a great job up there i really like watching the show when
[3:44:31.240 --> 3:44:40.120]  you're hosting oh thank you sir um yeah um i woke up today and turned on the news and uh immediately
[3:44:40.120 --> 3:44:45.320]  i'm i'm i'm assaulted with this whole uh i don't know what day it was when they were having this
[3:44:45.320 --> 3:44:49.960]  back and forth but uh apparently you know trump was coming out and saying all these things about 911
[3:44:49.960 --> 3:44:56.360]  and then the uh talking about the video clips that they showed of uh you know the jihadi is basically
[3:44:56.360 --> 3:45:02.600]  laughing and and and cheering it on when you know across the way you see you know the events of 911
[3:45:02.600 --> 3:45:08.600]  going on and you know between him and ben carson the back and the fourth and then you know ben
[3:45:08.600 --> 3:45:14.920]  carson basically you know uh doing a 180 on what he said it just seems to me like the whole republican
[3:45:14.920 --> 3:45:23.240]  party is just it's just a total disinformation campaign now and it's also you know it it does
[3:45:23.240 --> 3:45:28.440]  a lot of damage to the 911 truth movement i just want to know what your thoughts on that were well
[3:45:28.440 --> 3:45:33.400]  when it comes to these political elections especially presidents i do agree by and large
[3:45:33.400 --> 3:45:37.880]  they're just uh political theater for lack of a better term these guys are going out there to
[3:45:37.880 --> 3:45:42.440]  entertain they're trying to captivate the audience i think a lot of it is they can get their focus
[3:45:42.440 --> 3:45:47.160]  groups together and just go out there and talk about what they think people want to hear so i
[3:45:47.160 --> 3:45:54.760]  think there is a lot of that going on as far as helping or hurting the 911 truth movement it may
[3:45:54.760 --> 3:45:59.960]  be so but it also may direct people to sites like architects and engineers and some of the other
[3:45:59.960 --> 3:46:04.440]  reports and information that is out there that allow people to see the truth thank you so much for
[3:46:04.440 --> 3:46:12.920]  your call josh in tennessee let's go on to dug and was that minnesota hey zikari how are you doing
[3:46:12.920 --> 3:46:19.640]  happy thank you into you guys well thank you happy thanks given to you say i'm from st cloud
[3:46:19.640 --> 3:46:25.880]  minnesota we moved away for a while and came back and it's not the same place you might say
[3:46:26.600 --> 3:46:33.720]  there's a lot of muslims there now and the city council and everybody really tries to cater a
[3:46:33.720 --> 3:46:44.920]  lot to them including uh check high school they allow them to use prayer in the gym but our kids
[3:46:44.920 --> 3:46:51.480]  can't do it and i thought that prayer was taken out of the schools but they're allowed to do it
[3:46:51.480 --> 3:46:56.520]  they said well that's their that's their belief that's their religion well what happened to ours
[3:46:56.520 --> 3:47:05.560]  and anytime a president takes better care of foreigners or terrorists call them what you want
[3:47:06.440 --> 3:47:12.600]  over the citizens and the people of the united states that gets me to kind of question
[3:47:13.160 --> 3:47:20.440]  is he really a president or is he setting up for his own little army and the takeover of the united
[3:47:20.440 --> 3:47:28.680]  states you know i mean look at it it's you know you you can't chase these guys down because it
[3:47:28.680 --> 3:47:35.560]  it affects their constitutional rights for privacy well wait a minute you know you're
[3:47:35.560 --> 3:47:43.080]  doing everything to the citizens i think this country needs to just pound and pound their congressmen
[3:47:43.080 --> 3:47:49.320]  their senators call them every day time and time again and just hound them and hound them and say
[3:47:49.320 --> 3:47:56.200]  you know what you did you took an oath of office you haven't been justified your oath of office it's
[3:47:56.200 --> 3:48:03.080]  time to go well as far as your point i'm just going to interject as far as your point of the
[3:48:03.080 --> 3:48:07.320]  kids in schools not being able to pray and the kids being sent home because they have rosary
[3:48:07.320 --> 3:48:13.160]  beads and things of that nature i do agree it is a very selective enforcement type of deal
[3:48:14.040 --> 3:48:17.480]  going on in the school system thank you so much for your call doug we're going to move on
[3:48:17.480 --> 3:48:25.160]  one very quickly before i break to shane in illinois yes sir i was uh trying to stay in
[3:48:25.160 --> 3:48:30.680]  contact with some friends of mine in illinois i'm in uh i work up in the north dakot area and
[3:48:30.680 --> 3:48:36.600]  and i kind of uh we did myself off the television you know just came up here to work and read and
[3:48:36.600 --> 3:48:42.120]  all that stuff but uh you know you were saying that about syria that it's not being it's not
[3:48:42.120 --> 3:48:48.680]  being a uh played on the news right now is that correct as far as what as far as the plane being
[3:48:48.680 --> 3:48:55.320]  shot down oh the play that's being uh that's in the news i guess i'm not exactly sure what question
[3:48:55.320 --> 3:49:01.160]  you're asking okay well the question i would it's not necessarily a question as much as you know if
[3:49:01.160 --> 3:49:06.680]  they were not playing that that uh i thought i i must have misheard that were the were the were the
[3:49:06.680 --> 3:49:13.720]  mainstream media per se is not is not uh reporting this as as as it is on the internet you know this
[3:49:13.720 --> 3:49:18.680]  is a big deal as far as i can especially when it comes to like a biblical prophecy and i don't
[3:49:18.680 --> 3:49:24.120]  mean to go that direction with it but you know there's a couple watermarks in the bible that i
[3:49:24.120 --> 3:49:31.320]  always that i keep watching for and the one is when damascus burns you know damascus has always
[3:49:31.320 --> 3:49:37.640]  been as damascus since you know since the damascus has been created damascus has always existed
[3:49:37.640 --> 3:49:43.880]  and uh here it is smoking right now with uh with the uh when when russia gets involved they're
[3:49:43.880 --> 3:49:49.400]  actually pulled into the confrontation as opposed to russia just kind of mountain up and and uh
[3:49:49.960 --> 3:49:54.840]  being some kind of a thug you know some some kind of a warlord thug they actually get pulled into
[3:49:54.840 --> 3:50:00.280]  the confrontation i kind of see that happening you know simultaneously right now and uh if they
[3:50:00.280 --> 3:50:04.520]  weren't playing that in the bible my my uh i guess it wouldn't have been a question as much as the
[3:50:04.520 --> 3:50:12.440]  statement is uh i think uh as much as the bible gets played out almost to the t that uh the uh
[3:50:12.440 --> 3:50:17.480]  the immediate blacks it out syria has been the whole story that's been going on in syria probably
[3:50:17.480 --> 3:50:20.840]  for the last four or five years now i've been watching this because like i said that's the
[3:50:20.840 --> 3:50:25.400]  that's a watermark you wouldn't hear nothing from syria and then all of a sudden like within the last
[3:50:25.400 --> 3:50:30.840]  six months it's been a and i'm probably extending the timeline a little bit but it's syria syria
[3:50:30.840 --> 3:50:36.200]  syria syria right down to the refugees yeah well since the um since obama said the red line and then
[3:50:36.200 --> 3:50:40.120]  backtracked a lot you got said the red line not me like no you said it mr president well thank you

[3:56:26.200 --> 3:56:30.920]  sorry to david we may not get to you but let's go to bill in ohio he wants to talk about hillary go
[3:56:30.920 --> 3:56:39.480]  ahead bill hey i appreciate you put me on here um i have a youtube video of me confronting hillary
[3:56:39.480 --> 3:56:46.760]  with a couple friends of mine at a book signing in ohio in 2013 okay what's uh yeah go ahead and
[3:56:46.760 --> 3:56:54.600]  throw that out yeah if you go to youtube and you put in marine veteran and friends confront hillary
[3:56:54.600 --> 3:57:01.880]  at book signing it's only 46 seconds long and we were ushered out by the secret service but
[3:57:01.880 --> 3:57:07.720]  i did this for a reason to show people that you can confront this woman and you're not going to get
[3:57:07.720 --> 3:57:13.240]  tased you're not going to get thrown in jail and and i have a i'm a united states marine veteran
[3:57:13.240 --> 3:57:19.560]  and i i have a deep dislike for this woman for on many levels but the reason why i did that video
[3:57:19.560 --> 3:57:24.840]  is when that we took the barricades down at the white house during the shutdown i was one of the
[3:57:24.840 --> 3:57:30.600]  veterans that did that and you guys were there filming at that time and the more and more people
[3:57:30.600 --> 3:57:35.240]  i talked to i kept telling them hillary is going to be the next problem hillary is going to be the
[3:57:35.240 --> 3:57:42.280]  next problem but what was neat is you had seven rules that you could do before you ever got in
[3:57:42.280 --> 3:57:47.640]  there one of them was no recording devices and you went through three checkpoints i actually bought
[3:57:47.640 --> 3:57:53.960]  a watch with a hidden camera in it and it's very smart bill i'm sorry we have to jump to our next
[3:57:53.960 --> 3:57:58.760]  caller uh thank you so much for calling bill david in california you have about 40 seconds go ahead
[3:58:00.040 --> 3:58:03.560]  all right on this is david i just love you guys but i just let's get to the point
[3:58:03.560 --> 3:58:10.920]  this russian down or down the jet by by turkey is the doomsday um scenario beginner right there man
[3:58:10.920 --> 3:58:18.280]  and as usual the mainstream media is covering a false flag black lives matter attack to cover up
[3:58:18.280 --> 3:58:22.520]  the problem the main problem that's really important in the world which is the fact that
[3:58:22.520 --> 3:58:28.520]  a nato uh nato ally just down to the russian jet that is that's what we've all been waiting for
[3:58:28.520 --> 3:58:32.040]  well thank you so much david in california and i will agree there is somewhat of a despair in
[3:58:32.040 --> 3:58:36.840]  the news on all manner of topics not just that stay tuned the info wars nightly news tonight with david
[3:58:36.840 --> 3:58:45.560]  night
