[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:21.000 --> 00:27.000]  Yes, I think the Republican nominee is unfit to serve as president.
[00:27.000 --> 00:31.000]  Roger Stone nailed it right here on Infowars.
[00:49.000 --> 00:53.000]  And like clockwork, the gloves came off.
[00:53.000 --> 00:56.000]  I think people are questioning his fitness for office.
[00:56.000 --> 01:00.000]  The fact of the matter is, Hitler was elected as Chancellor of Germany.
[01:00.000 --> 01:09.000]  He did not become a dictator until later when people began to be influenced by his foolishness.
[01:09.000 --> 01:14.000]  We just elected a president, and he's got a lot of foolishness going on.
[01:14.000 --> 01:16.000]  Are you questioning his fitness?
[01:16.000 --> 01:18.000]  Yes, I do.
[01:18.000 --> 01:20.000]  Let me be clear. You said he's unfit for command.
[01:20.000 --> 01:21.000]  I think so.
[01:21.000 --> 01:23.000]  He is deranged, in my opinion.
[01:23.000 --> 01:29.000]  His fitness for office, and there's been questions about the 25th Amendment to the Constitution,
[01:29.000 --> 01:32.000]  whether or not he should be removed for medical reasons.
[01:32.000 --> 01:38.000]  He's not only unfit to be president. In my book, his lack of empathy, his lack of leadership, his lack of courage,
[01:38.000 --> 01:40.000]  he's unfit to be human.
[01:40.000 --> 01:47.000]  In the midst of it all, an ESPN reporter bizarrely reassigned because of political correctness.
[01:47.000 --> 01:52.000]  ESPN executives have decided that play-by-play announcer Robert Lee
[01:52.000 --> 01:58.000]  seen there on the right will not be in the broadcast booth for next Saturday's college football season opener
[01:58.000 --> 02:03.000]  in Charlottesville between the University of Virginia and the College of William & Mary
[02:03.000 --> 02:10.000]  because of the similarity between his name and the famed Confederate icon General Robert E. Lee.
[02:10.000 --> 02:15.000]  While mainstream media pundits sold the gullible support for Antifa.
[02:15.000 --> 02:19.000]  Two gentlemen with very different views on how to respond to white supremacists when they take to the streets.
[02:19.000 --> 02:25.000]  Mark Bray is a Dartmouth professor who has studied the Antifa anti-fascist movement.
[02:25.000 --> 02:30.000]  Antifa is a far-left political movement that argues it's necessary to confront hate groups sometimes with force.
[02:30.000 --> 02:35.000]  Professor Bray is author of the new book, Antifa, the Anti-Fascist Handbook.
[02:35.000 --> 02:40.000]  Some of the criticism of the Antifa movement, Mark, is that you're actually against speech.
[02:40.000 --> 02:45.000]  That you want to shut down this speech and that borders on censorship.
[02:45.000 --> 02:49.000]  Well, let's be clear that Antifa are not calling on the government to censor anyone.
[02:49.000 --> 02:54.000]  In fact, they resist the notion of turning to the government or turning to the police
[02:54.000 --> 02:58.000]  who we've seen have been infiltrated by white supremacists who have been sympathetic to the court
[02:58.000 --> 03:01.000]  sort of returned to law and order notion of fascism.
[03:01.000 --> 03:05.000]  And so the idea is the real enemies of free speech are fascists.
[03:05.000 --> 03:10.000]  We've seen that historically. We've seen that they're the ones that if they have their way will shut down speech.
[03:10.000 --> 03:17.000]  Antifa, an army of Soros-funded children spewing anti-American left-wing hatred,
[03:17.000 --> 03:23.000]  61% of them returning to their parents' basements draped in communist propaganda.
[03:23.000 --> 03:27.000]  The people who turned out to protest Nazis, why are they stalling to you?
[03:27.000 --> 03:32.000]  The Antifa group to me is totally a very Stalin-ish kind of group.
[03:32.000 --> 03:33.000]  How so?
[03:33.000 --> 03:37.000]  If you want to set fires and burn place to the ground, that doesn't sound like a very peaceful group to me.
[03:37.000 --> 03:40.000]  There was a group the president mentioned that we haven't heard about.
[03:40.000 --> 03:46.000]  The alt-left. So who are they? Simply put, the alt-left does not exist.
[03:46.000 --> 03:52.000]  According to the Anti-Defamation League, it's a made-up term that refers to no actual group or organization.
[03:52.000 --> 03:57.000]  Many in the alt-right actually refer to groups when they protest them as Antifa.
[03:57.000 --> 03:59.000]  That refers to anti-fascists.
[03:59.000 --> 04:04.000]  It's a name that some groups have latched onto, borrowing from an old left-wing extreme movement
[04:04.000 --> 04:07.000]  that popped up in the 1960s in Germany.
[04:07.000 --> 04:11.000]  Their goal is to physically confront Nazis and white supremacists.
[04:11.000 --> 04:16.000]  When we talk about the groups, the green and black flag that was seen at the Charlottesville event
[04:16.000 --> 04:19.000]  is the Kekestani flag. Kekestani is a fake country.
[04:19.000 --> 04:22.000]  The flag mimics a German-Nazi war flag.
[04:22.000 --> 04:29.000]  Who are these fools, really, that have been given the platform to misrepresent the American dream?
[04:29.000 --> 04:34.000]  Instead, rampaging the globalist nightmare of totalitarianism
[04:34.000 --> 04:40.000]  down the throats of 330-plus million Americans that can see right through them.
[04:40.000 --> 04:48.000]  Obviously, it is the hysterical mainstream media that is truly unfit to report the news.
[04:48.000 --> 04:53.000]  Are you an advocate of this sort of confrontation?
[04:53.000 --> 04:55.000]  Yes, I am, yes.
[04:55.000 --> 05:00.000]  Now reporting for Infowars.com
[05:25.000 --> 05:29.000]  But with the rapid speed of life, we need to be able to keep up the pace.

[05:33.000 --> 05:37.000]  to let your body relax and get the sleep you need.
[05:37.000 --> 05:39.000]  Wake up refreshed and take on the day.
[05:39.000 --> 05:43.000]  Infowars Life wants to bring you a sleep support formula
[05:43.000 --> 05:47.000]  that goes above and beyond other leading brands at an affordable price.
[05:47.000 --> 05:51.000]  Get the sleep you deserve and experience the power of knockout.
[05:51.000 --> 05:55.000]  Head on over to InfowarsLife.com and say goodbye to fatigue.
[05:55.000 --> 06:21.000]  That's InfowarsLife.com
[06:25.000 --> 06:36.000]  Well, to say you've been hit in Texas, where I'm sitting right now in Central Texas,
[06:36.000 --> 06:44.000]  to say that Hurricane Harvey has been a megastorm that's still ongoing is to put it mildly.
[06:44.000 --> 06:49.000]  It basically went towards the east once it made landfall Friday.
[06:49.000 --> 06:54.000]  It did not hit San Antonio or Austin, Texas directly.
[06:54.000 --> 06:58.000]  But both cities have gotten over a foot of rain.
[06:58.000 --> 07:03.000]  Houston is under 20 feet of water, ladies and gentlemen.
[07:03.000 --> 07:05.000]  20 feet.
[07:05.000 --> 07:08.000]  Dr. Group, who we worked for routinely, sent me photos.
[07:08.000 --> 07:10.000]  In fact, I should tweet these out of his office.
[07:10.000 --> 07:12.000]  His offices are on the third floor.
[07:12.000 --> 07:18.000]  The water this morning was 18 feet up on the side of the building approaching the third floor.
[07:18.000 --> 07:21.000]  It's now 20 feet up.
[07:21.000 --> 07:30.000]  And you have this megastorm sucking the humidity out of the hot gulf and dumping it at massive pace
[07:30.000 --> 07:34.000]  on to Houston and East Texas where the storm has stalled.
[07:34.000 --> 07:39.000]  Now, thank God, but it's also sad the death toll is only five.
[07:39.000 --> 07:41.000]  It could be a lot higher.
[07:41.000 --> 07:43.000]  I've got family in Houston.
[07:43.000 --> 07:44.000]  I can't get ahold of them.
[07:44.000 --> 07:46.000]  The cell phones are out.
[07:46.000 --> 07:50.000]  People didn't expect it to even be this bad.
[07:50.000 --> 07:55.000]  This makes Katrina look like a cakewalk, unfortunately.
[07:55.000 --> 08:00.000]  And that was a terrible storm, not lessening the effect that happened there.
[08:00.000 --> 08:08.000]  I was also sent by a friend in Houston a photo of a eight foot alligator on his front porch.
[08:08.000 --> 08:16.000]  And I've got other reports, mainstream news of huge 12, 13, 14 foot alligators walking around in people's yards,
[08:16.000 --> 08:18.000]  coming into their houses.
[08:18.000 --> 08:21.000]  We haven't gotten footage of them in the houses yet, but those reports are there.
[08:21.000 --> 08:30.000]  And I don't doubt it because we have three different newscasts showing bass and perch and catfish and minnows in people's houses.
[08:30.000 --> 08:32.000]  That's up on infowars.com.
[08:32.000 --> 08:34.000]  A little collation of that.
[08:34.000 --> 08:43.000]  DrudgeReport.com has even more extensive coverage, all right there, the top left-hand side of DrudgeReport.com of the fish in the houses.
[08:43.000 --> 08:45.000]  So you can see it.
[08:45.000 --> 08:47.000]  People trying to noodle.
[08:47.000 --> 08:52.000]  That is a, I guess that's like a shark or something in the house.
[08:52.000 --> 08:55.000]  I mean, this is just, this is incredible.
[08:55.000 --> 08:57.000]  This is insane.
[08:57.000 --> 09:00.000]  Or is that a hard head type of catfish?
[09:00.000 --> 09:02.000]  I can't exactly tell.
[09:02.000 --> 09:04.000]  It looks kind of like a shark to me.
[09:04.000 --> 09:05.000]  I don't know.
[09:05.000 --> 09:06.000]  This is getting more and more insane.
[09:06.000 --> 09:08.000]  I hadn't even seen that video yet.
[09:08.000 --> 09:10.000]  I just seen the one of bass and catfish and perch.
[09:10.000 --> 09:12.000]  I don't know what that fish is.
[09:12.000 --> 09:14.000]  Like a two foot long fish.
[09:14.000 --> 09:17.000]  Eight foot long alligators fish.
[09:17.000 --> 09:26.000]  The craziest footage and it's horrifying is an old folks home with people up to their chest in a flooded old folks home outside Houston.
[09:26.000 --> 09:32.000]  Now the mayor reportedly didn't put out an evacuation call, which is why a lot of people stayed there.
[09:32.000 --> 09:34.000]  I wouldn't be enlisted to the mayor one way or the other.
[09:34.000 --> 09:35.000]  I make my own decision.
[09:35.000 --> 09:41.000]  I personally got family out of my ex-wife where she lives.
[09:41.000 --> 09:43.000]  I mean, I offered to pay for it just because I just wanted to do it.
[09:43.000 --> 09:48.000]  Because she lives by a creek and the house gets close to flooding when it normally rains really hard.
[09:48.000 --> 09:50.000]  So she's in a hotel right now.
[09:50.000 --> 09:56.000]  I mean, you don't need the government to tell you that ladies and gentlemen, if you have the means, get out.
[09:56.000 --> 09:58.000]  But what if you are in an old folks home?
[09:58.000 --> 10:00.000]  Like we saw in Katrina or a prisoner.
[10:00.000 --> 10:03.000]  They did evacuate the prisons and jails.
[10:03.000 --> 10:04.000]  And here's the problem.
[10:04.000 --> 10:19.000]  The hurricane is stalled right over Victoria and Houston, going into areas of East Texas and into western Louisiana.
[10:19.000 --> 10:21.000]  So we will continue to cover this.
[10:21.000 --> 10:23.000]  Owen Shroyer got back this afternoon.
[10:23.000 --> 10:26.000]  He'll be in studio with me tomorrow exhausted.
[10:26.000 --> 10:28.000]  Harrison and he went down there to cover it.
[10:28.000 --> 10:33.000]  And there was no cell phone, no internet, no uploads, most roads shut down.
[10:33.000 --> 10:34.000]  Most roads flooded.
[10:34.000 --> 10:42.000]  They got within 20 miles of the outskirts of Houston and the roads are closed because there's water going over them.
[10:42.000 --> 10:44.000]  Rivers.
[10:44.000 --> 10:47.000]  So this isn't like the levees flooded.
[10:47.000 --> 10:51.000]  So the ninth ward flooded, which was terrible, horrible event.
[10:51.000 --> 10:54.000]  Geographically though, much, much smaller.
[10:54.000 --> 10:56.000]  Because most Louisiana is already a swamp.
[10:56.000 --> 11:00.000]  So people are already prepared for or live on house posts or whatever.
[11:00.000 --> 11:01.000]  Still devastating.
[11:01.000 --> 11:10.000]  So this is definitely living up to be the demon storm or the hellstorm that meteorologists thought it might be.
[11:10.000 --> 11:12.000]  And the winds have been devastating.
[11:12.000 --> 11:16.000]  Owen got back today and was able to upload the footage he shot this morning.
[11:16.000 --> 11:23.000]  Outskirts of Houston, the fronts of buildings blown off, Walmart, facades blown down.
[11:23.000 --> 11:30.000]  Stop signs bent over to the ground, mobile homes thrown on top people's vehicles.
[11:30.000 --> 11:32.000]  Just a lot of devastation.
[11:32.000 --> 11:34.000]  And of course, wait for it.
[11:34.000 --> 11:36.000]  You know what you're going to hear.
[11:36.000 --> 11:39.000]  Houston's probably the most diverse city now.
[11:39.000 --> 11:46.000]  They argue whether it's LA or Houston of the United States, Asian, black, white, Hispanic.
[11:46.000 --> 11:51.000]  It's a city of 10 million people.
[11:51.000 --> 11:56.000]  It's the fourth largest city now in the United States.
[11:56.000 --> 12:00.000]  And they're going to say, this is racist, the response is enough.
[12:00.000 --> 12:02.000]  Trump's been on top of it.
[12:02.000 --> 12:04.000]  The emergency manager's been on top of it.
[12:04.000 --> 12:07.000]  The governor of Texas has been on top of it.
[12:07.000 --> 12:11.000]  Some of the locals have kind of a lackadaisical response.
[12:11.000 --> 12:15.000]  And then I've seen all over Twitter and all over Facebook Friday.
[12:15.000 --> 12:24.000]  And then again, yesterday saying, thank God, we hope God kills all those rednecks in Texas and Louisiana that voted Trump.
[12:24.000 --> 12:32.000]  But if you are so racist and hate white people, you still need to understand that people are people.
[12:32.000 --> 12:35.000]  And by the way, Houston is minority white.
[12:35.000 --> 12:38.000]  So it's an insane way to think.
[12:38.000 --> 12:44.000]  But MSNBC and CNN have taken everything going on in the news and they turn it to racial.
[12:44.000 --> 12:47.000]  And they make it like white people somehow did it.
[12:47.000 --> 12:52.000]  So that's how the leftist online interpret all of this.
[12:52.000 --> 12:54.000]  And that's how they're pushing it.
[12:54.000 --> 13:02.000]  But you're going to have the double thing where they're saying, we hope all you white people die, you rednecks, you know, in Texas because you voted Trump.
[13:02.000 --> 13:09.000]  But then we're also already hearing that Trump, Friday, we were already hearing, didn't respond properly.
[13:09.000 --> 13:20.000]  Because when he put out an advisory about it, when the White House put out a video, they didn't tell people what to do or where to go.
[13:20.000 --> 13:22.000]  That's not what the president does.
[13:22.000 --> 13:30.000]  That's the counties and the emergency managers with the governor and then FEMA and then the National Guard.
[13:30.000 --> 13:40.000]  So if Trump would have sat there and told folks where to go or what to do, how could you do that in a 60-second video telling everybody to get to higher ground, work together, listen to local emergency management
[13:40.000 --> 13:49.000]  and, you know, best wishes and that the president's going to back you and try to get as much aid in there as possible once we find out where the storm's going to go.
[13:49.000 --> 13:51.000]  That was Friday.
[13:51.000 --> 13:59.000]  Friday afternoon before it even hit Rockport, before it even came on shore, they were saying that Trump had already not done the right thing.
[13:59.000 --> 14:00.000]  Here's the headline.
[14:00.000 --> 14:04.000]  Politico and CNN, because this is a talking point, had the same headline Friday night.
[14:04.000 --> 14:05.000]  I saw it.
[14:05.000 --> 14:06.000]  We'll just type it in.
[14:06.000 --> 14:07.000]  Let's see if my memory serves.
[14:07.000 --> 14:13.000]  Trump's already messed up on his response to Harvey.
[14:13.000 --> 14:15.000]  And I'm not here to defend Trump.
[14:15.000 --> 14:17.000]  I'm here to defend reality.
[14:17.000 --> 14:27.000]  Obama didn't even visit in 2016 when a big hurricane hit Louisiana, Mississippi and other areas and killed hundreds of people and flooded two states.
[14:27.000 --> 14:29.000]  He didn't even visit.
[14:29.000 --> 14:31.000]  George W. Bush visited twice.
[14:31.000 --> 14:40.000]  He said, great job, Brownie, some guy that owned, you know, fancy Arabian horses that didn't know his head from a hole in the ground and the response probably wasn't as good as it could be.
[14:40.000 --> 14:42.000]  And I'm not defending George W. Bush.
[14:42.000 --> 14:43.000]  George W. Bush didn't like me.
[14:43.000 --> 14:47.000]  George W. Bush had me arrested one time for asking him a question.
[14:47.000 --> 14:48.000]  It's on video.
[14:48.000 --> 15:10.000]  But I don't get just the mindless double-sided attacks on Trump and the media hoping the economy implodes so that they can just hope somehow that his agenda fails of trying to turn the economy on because they want the general public of the Democratic Party to be absolutely destitute and depending on the government for their bread every day.
[15:10.000 --> 15:15.000]  That is the collectivist model of Venezuela or North Korea.
[15:15.000 --> 15:16.000]  There it is.
[15:16.000 --> 15:19.000]  President Trump's response to Hurricane Harvey devastation.
[15:19.000 --> 15:20.000]  Wow.
[15:20.000 --> 15:21.000]  No, that's not the one.
[15:21.000 --> 15:25.000]  It was Trump's already messed up his response to the hurricane.
[15:25.000 --> 15:26.000]  That was it.
[15:26.000 --> 15:31.000]  It was all over just because he put out a video to people that didn't tell him what to do.
[15:31.000 --> 15:33.000]  Just telling him, I'm here to back you.
[15:33.000 --> 15:41.000]  That's what the president is supposed to do is to say, we're going to try to give as much federal support as we can, but not to before even know where the hurricane is going to go.
[15:41.000 --> 15:43.000]  Now, it's official.
[15:43.000 --> 15:46.000]  The globalists have banned info wars in the White House.
[15:46.000 --> 15:47.000]  That was on Bloomberg.

[15:48.000 --> 15:50.000]  We've got Chelsea Clinton attacking me again.
[15:50.000 --> 15:52.000]  Huge news.

[19:00.000 --> 19:06.000]  After being sold out for months, our best selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at info wars store dot com.
[19:06.000 --> 19:08.000]  Research across the board is clear.
[19:08.000 --> 19:13.000]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[19:13.000 --> 19:20.000]  That's why the last surgeon general's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[19:20.000 --> 19:24.000]  Super blue fluoride free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[19:24.000 --> 19:28.000]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine, some of the bad halogen fluoride.
[19:28.000 --> 19:35.000]  Super blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[19:35.000 --> 19:43.000]  Just some of the ingredients in super blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.
[19:43.000 --> 19:47.000]  Due to requests from listeners who found that spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children.

[20:20.000 --> 20:27.000]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[20:27.000 --> 20:36.000]  Here's the big takeaway as we're in the middle of this hellstorm as Drudge Report calls it hurricane RV.
[20:36.000 --> 20:42.000]  Everybody is a human in Houston no matter what color you are.
[20:42.000 --> 20:56.000]  And the old folks in those old folks homes to the firefighters and police officers, the people stuck in their attics as the water level only rises 20 feet on average.
[20:56.000 --> 20:58.000]  Those are real people.
[20:58.000 --> 21:10.000]  And when you look at CNN or MSNBC race baiting continually, it shows you how ridiculous it is when we're all in this together.
[21:10.000 --> 21:18.000]  They simply beat you over the head if you don't support Obamacare or open borders or their gun control saying you're a racist with no proof.
[21:18.000 --> 21:22.000]  And that's why major lawsuits have been filed.
[21:22.000 --> 21:26.000]  I've told you I'm getting ready to file some and I'm looking at Tom Brokaw right now.
[21:26.000 --> 21:28.000]  I'm sending the letters this week.
[21:28.000 --> 21:29.000]  I put a video out today.
[21:29.000 --> 21:30.000]  I've got to put them on notice.
[21:30.000 --> 21:32.000]  Give them a chance to retract.
[21:32.000 --> 21:35.000]  The damage has already been done.
[21:35.000 --> 21:39.000]  We have serious damages and so does the family research council.
[21:39.000 --> 21:42.000]  So does D James Kennedy Ministries.
[21:42.000 --> 21:44.000]  It's filed lawsuits.
[21:44.000 --> 21:55.000]  I mean, when you start calling major mainline Christian organizations KKK Nazis and then deny them commerce.
[21:55.000 --> 22:00.000]  They're being denied Amazon accounts.
[22:00.000 --> 22:02.000]  They're being denied being able to sell books.
[22:02.000 --> 22:05.000]  They're being denied for being able to be part of major organizations.
[22:05.000 --> 22:10.000]  So they've taken this made up database and they're using it as a chilling effect, which is the mark of the beast.
[22:10.000 --> 22:16.000]  What Christians warn of is Christians being put in databases for our beliefs and then told we can't buy or sell.
[22:16.000 --> 22:18.000]  It's here.
[22:18.000 --> 22:27.000]  You know, I was naming the audio streams because we're on AM and FM radio, some cable and TV stations, but also internet streams on YouTube and Facebook for now.
[22:27.000 --> 22:28.000]  They're censoring us more and more.
[22:28.000 --> 22:29.000]  They've demonetized us.
[22:29.000 --> 22:30.000]  You name it.
[22:30.000 --> 22:37.000]  And I was thinking about the name of the show and I just said I went with hellstorm demonstorm Harvey live coverage because that's what it is.
[22:37.000 --> 22:42.000]  I'm right here in Austin, Texas where we've had a foot of rain.
[22:42.000 --> 22:43.000]  And thank God, no deaths.
[22:43.000 --> 22:45.000]  Nothing compared to 20 feet.
[22:45.000 --> 22:48.000]  And by the way, when I say 20 feet, I don't mean 20 feet of rain.
[22:48.000 --> 22:53.000]  I mean, the water is 20 feet high on average.
[22:53.000 --> 22:58.000]  By the way, I didn't tell Michael Zimmerman, one of our great camera people and reporters to go down there.
[22:58.000 --> 23:01.000]  He has family in Houston.
[23:01.000 --> 23:04.000]  Our one crew couldn't get in.
[23:04.000 --> 23:07.000]  So Zimmerman, I guess, can't get ahold of some of his family.
[23:07.000 --> 23:16.000]  He just threw a kayak in the back of my Ford F 150 truck that we use as the office car.
[23:16.000 --> 23:23.000]  And he just drove down there in my Ford F 150 by himself on his own volition.
[23:23.000 --> 23:24.000]  I did not tell him to go.
[23:24.000 --> 23:29.000]  I guess he called do our news director and said, can I have Alex's truck that we use as the company car?
[23:29.000 --> 23:32.000]  That's the top operation we are.
[23:32.000 --> 23:34.000]  He's just gone down there.
[23:34.000 --> 23:44.000]  So let's pray for Michael Zimmerman who was with me when I was getting attacked by all the leftist fascists down in the Rover in Seattle last week.
[23:44.000 --> 23:45.000]  Again, he's from Houston.
[23:45.000 --> 23:47.000]  So I guess he knows how to get in there and how to get out.
[23:47.000 --> 23:52.000]  But here is the governor Greg Abbott thanking President Trump.
[23:52.000 --> 23:56.000]  I mean, compared to Obama and compared to Bush, I mean, Bush was not that good.
[23:56.000 --> 24:00.000]  Obama just didn't even care or ever show up or even just say anything.
[24:00.000 --> 24:05.000]  It was so crazy to watch the media crucify Bush and then do nothing on Obama.
[24:05.000 --> 24:07.000]  I wouldn't care if I was Republican or Democrat.
[24:07.000 --> 24:08.000]  It's ridiculous.
[24:08.000 --> 24:13.000]  And now Trump is like on it, like flies on, you know what?
[24:13.000 --> 24:15.000]  And they're like, he's done a terrible job.
[24:15.000 --> 24:18.000]  Well, here's the governor.
[24:18.000 --> 24:24.000]  The White House is fully engaged, very helpful, very concerned about the people of Texas.
[24:24.000 --> 24:30.000]  Texas has received everything that we've asked for from the White House and we're very grateful for it.
[24:30.000 --> 24:35.000]  And we're just working hard day and night to make sure we take care of our fellow Texans.
[24:35.000 --> 24:40.000]  Notice he said they've done everything we've asked for.
[24:40.000 --> 24:48.000]  That's another thing Obama did is he'd send in feds just to monitor everything but do nothing and act like they were in charge.
[24:48.000 --> 24:54.000]  Notice with Trump, it's Texas is in charge because it's Texas.
[24:54.000 --> 24:57.000]  And then if they ask Trump for something, he'll do it.
[24:57.000 --> 25:07.000]  Remember when Texas had wildfires and floods and Obama wouldn't help four times the first time in modern history that a president refused a state aid.
[25:07.000 --> 25:11.000]  People thought Chris Christie was a chicken, you know what?
[25:11.000 --> 25:13.000]  Chicken SH, you know what?
[25:13.000 --> 25:18.000]  For blocking a bridge during rush hour, over trying to get some funding he wanted.
[25:18.000 --> 25:19.000]  I think that was terrible.
[25:19.000 --> 25:21.000]  Christie got caught doing it.
[25:21.000 --> 25:25.000]  That's nothing compared to wildfires over a third of the state.
[25:25.000 --> 25:33.000]  Hundreds and hundreds dead, floods, you name it, and hey, you're not getting any federal aid.
[25:33.000 --> 25:38.000]  Trump to visit Texas Tuesday raises Harvey recovery efforts.
[25:38.000 --> 25:46.000]  The reason he's coming Tuesday is it's not going to be gone and it'll be a distraction if he comes in here anytime before that.
[25:46.000 --> 25:48.000]  In fact, Tuesday might be too early.
[25:48.000 --> 25:50.000]  Now let's stop right there.
[25:50.000 --> 25:53.000]  This is not a defense of Trump hour.
[25:53.000 --> 25:59.000]  Joining us the last 30 minutes of the transmission next hour, Roger Stone and I had a long conversation today.
[25:59.000 --> 26:04.000]  Former Chief Strategist for Trump, former head of his campaign, 40 plus year good friend with him.
[26:04.000 --> 26:07.000]  And I made some other phone calls, really smart cookies.
[26:07.000 --> 26:15.000]  And the word is Trump has broken some of his campaign promises to a certain extent because they weren't clear cut.
[26:15.000 --> 26:25.000]  And he has gone sideways with the neocons and the military industrial complex with the situation with what's unfolding in Afghanistan.
[26:25.000 --> 26:29.000]  That's why Bannon and Gorkin have resigned and it's it's bad.
[26:29.000 --> 26:31.000]  So I'll just tell you when something's bad.
[26:31.000 --> 26:33.000]  I'm just going to clear cut something's bad.
[26:33.000 --> 26:34.000]  I'm going to tell you.
[26:34.000 --> 26:37.000]  And I understand the president believes what he's doing.
[26:37.000 --> 26:40.000]  He believes he's violating his own instincts.
[26:40.000 --> 26:44.000]  But the smart money says we've been there 17 years.
[26:44.000 --> 26:46.000]  No one's ever won there.
[26:46.000 --> 26:48.000]  It's not clear cut.
[26:48.000 --> 26:54.000]  And unless this is really some fancy way to go in and evacuate the main force, making it look like it's a build up.
[26:54.000 --> 26:57.000]  And some people think that's what's happening.
[26:57.000 --> 27:08.000]  But a lot of other smart folks, high level CIA, high level defense intelligence, high level special forces command, special operations command, high level White House contacts.
[27:08.000 --> 27:12.000]  Trump listens to those generals and he, you know, he green lights them.
[27:12.000 --> 27:17.000]  And they've told him, sir, we'll actually kill all the Al Qaeda and ISIS in one year.
[27:17.000 --> 27:27.000]  And then you can negotiate from strength and we've just been, we've been hamstrung and then he went and talked to a bunch of the special forces people that told them they'd been blocked by Obama and by Bush.
[27:27.000 --> 27:33.000]  A member Colonel Shaffer has always talked about two times they could have killed bin Laden back in 2001 before 9 11 and they were ordered not to.
[27:33.000 --> 27:38.000]  So Trump means, well, it's not being done from an evil perspective.
[27:38.000 --> 27:41.000]  The globalist hating.
[27:41.000 --> 27:45.000]  And unlike Obama, Trump defers the general's advice on military strategy.
[27:45.000 --> 27:49.000]  They keep saying he's this loose can and he's going to launch the nukes.
[27:49.000 --> 27:59.000]  It's Bill Clinton took the new codes away from the generals and has it all for himself and we're supposed to absorb a strike under PDD 61 or whatever.
[27:59.000 --> 28:02.000]  And absorb a strike before we decide what to do.
[28:02.000 --> 28:04.000]  There'll be nothing left.
[28:04.000 --> 28:08.000]  We should get Joel Scousen on this week to talk about the different PDDs.
[28:08.000 --> 28:14.000]  I mean, again, it's all lies, but I kind of don't like letting the generals do whatever they want.
[28:14.000 --> 28:17.000]  I want checks and balances.
[28:17.000 --> 28:19.000]  Just don't give Nancy Pelosi the launch code.
[28:19.000 --> 28:25.000]  She said George Bush was president again last week and said that you never cry wolf in a theater.
[28:25.000 --> 28:32.000]  That's you never cry fire in a theater, but she's for banning free speech now and that's coming up next.
[28:32.000 --> 28:33.000]  That's coming up next.
[28:33.000 --> 28:42.000]  They admit that they begun the process of banning info wars.com chief amongst all evil sites because we're so on target.
[28:42.000 --> 28:43.000]  We're so cutting edge.
[28:43.000 --> 28:47.000]  We give you the news way before it's later admitted sometimes years ahead.

[29:27.000 --> 29:28.000]  That's what I'm talking about.
[29:28.000 --> 29:37.000]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[29:37.000 --> 29:46.000]  Harvest right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color and nutritional value and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[29:46.000 --> 29:50.000]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.

[33:27.000 --> 33:34.000]  I've tweeted the image. We're also getting the video for you. You cannot make this up in Houston.
[33:34.000 --> 33:44.000]  Old folks homes with people sitting in their chairs with water up to their stomachs knitting in the old folks homes.
[33:44.000 --> 33:51.000]  Some areas are more than 20 feet underwater. We'll be covering it all live. I'm here in the relative safety of Austin, Texas.
[33:51.000 --> 33:57.000]  One of our crew members is on his own volition gone down there to cover it with a kayak because he's got family down there.
[33:57.000 --> 34:03.000]  Michael Zimmerman. This is coming up for a few minutes then in studio Chuck Johnson of gotnews.com.
[34:03.000 --> 34:16.000]  He was also banned from the White House by the globalist a ban from Trump reading it because Melania Trump likes to read his his website and give it to Trump been proven accurate over and over again.
[34:16.000 --> 34:24.000]  He was banned because of accuracy. Chelsea Clinton responds to Alex Jones video questioning Michelle Obama's gender again.
[34:24.000 --> 34:33.000]  It was one of the top videos Thursday online. So I did a video Friday about it showing Joan Rivers and other people not even saying I was sure of it.
[34:33.000 --> 34:43.000]  Asking is this proof she's a man when it looks like she's got a rubber snake in her pants and then they said that I said she was for sure and then I hate transgenders.
[34:43.000 --> 34:49.000]  When I said in the video, I don't hate anybody including transgenders and then Chelsea Clinton said whatever you do, don't watch the video.
[34:49.000 --> 34:55.000]  Well, the video is on info wars.com. You got to see it for yourself, but here and news wars.com.
[34:55.000 --> 35:03.000]  Here is my latest response to the former first ladies daughter Webster Hubble's daughter, Chelsea Clinton.
[35:03.000 --> 35:14.000]  And you got to see this for yourself. This is not for radio.
[35:14.000 --> 35:18.000]  Who needs fourth of July fireworks when you've got Joan Rivers?
[35:18.000 --> 35:19.000]  Oh, yeah.
[35:19.000 --> 35:24.000]  Yeah, the comedian who lately has been censoring her own typically outrageous commentary recently.
[35:24.000 --> 35:40.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the cover up of Michelle Obama's gender is collapsing.
[35:40.000 --> 35:51.000]  As we speak, CNN and hundreds of other publications are being forced to admit that Joan Rivers, who was friends with the Obamas, said that she was a trainee before she died.
[35:51.000 --> 35:59.000]  And they are desperately trying to cover up the footage, the new footage showing what is in Michelle Obama's pants.
[35:59.000 --> 36:10.000]  Chelsea Clinton has also come out and demonized yours truly claiming that I am this ultimate monster when all I'm doing is reporting on what CNN has already covered.
[36:10.000 --> 36:20.000]  They hope you don't watch this video and they really hope you don't share it.
[36:20.000 --> 36:24.000]  Who needs fourth of July fireworks when you've got Joan Rivers?
[36:24.000 --> 36:25.000]  Oh, yeah.
[36:25.000 --> 36:32.000]  Yeah, the comedian who lately has been censoring her own typically outrageous commentary recently, officiated a same-sex wedding.
[36:32.000 --> 36:37.000]  When a photographer pitched her a question, the response was, hmm, typical Rivers.
[36:37.000 --> 36:41.000]  You know Michelle is a transgender.
[36:41.000 --> 36:43.000]  I'm sorry, she's a what?
[36:43.000 --> 36:45.000]  A transgender. We all know.
[36:45.000 --> 36:46.000]  Oh my gosh.
[36:46.000 --> 36:50.000]  While it's very mean in some ways, people can't wait to hear what you have to say.
[36:50.000 --> 36:51.000]  Really?
[36:51.000 --> 36:52.000]  It's not mean.
[36:52.000 --> 37:01.000]  It's not mean. I tell the truth. I'm sure I say the same things that all your viewers say to their friends sitting next to them on the couch.
[37:01.000 --> 37:08.000]  Simply put, this is one of the most remarkable stories I've ever been involved in.
[37:08.000 --> 37:23.000]  I did a report yesterday pointing out that back on July 4th, 2014, Joan Rivers, who died a month later, came out and said that Obama was gay and that Michelle Obama was a training.
[37:23.000 --> 37:30.000]  Now, a lot of folks had already pointed out shots of her with bulges in her pants or her looking like she was a guy adjusting herself.
[37:30.000 --> 37:32.000]  But I hadn't really covered it.
[37:32.000 --> 37:37.000]  But when Joan Rivers died a month later, I said that we should look at it.
[37:37.000 --> 37:42.000]  Now, a new video has come out of them at Harvard last week with one of their reported daughters.
[37:42.000 --> 37:46.000]  And Michelle walks down with Obama and she's walking like a guy.
[37:46.000 --> 37:52.000]  And it looks like she's either got like a rubber snake from Halloween or something in her pants.
[37:52.000 --> 37:56.000]  And we simply said, wow, this is a viral video. What do you think?
[37:56.000 --> 38:00.000]  And the media misrepresented what we said.
[38:00.000 --> 38:05.000]  They claimed that we made it up and there was no mention of Joan Rivers.
[38:05.000 --> 38:19.000]  But the truth is, even CNN back at the time came out and had the headline that Joan Rivers was saying that Michelle Obama, who she was friends with and had dinner with many times, was a training.
[38:19.000 --> 38:24.000]  So they've been really trying to cover this up and they never mentioned Joan Rivers.
[38:24.000 --> 38:36.000]  The Daily Mail, though, kind of broke that taboo and came out and said, Alex Jones is slammed by Chelsea Clinton after promoting a shocking video claiming there's proof Michelle Obama is a man.
[38:36.000 --> 38:38.000]  At Michelle Obama.
[38:38.000 --> 38:43.000]  At Michelle Obama is everything this site will never be. Honorable, brave, beloved, beautiful.
[38:43.000 --> 38:45.000]  Don't need to watch an awful video to know that.
[38:45.000 --> 38:47.000]  I didn't visit the site or watch the video.
[38:47.000 --> 38:52.000]  Think we need to shine a light on the awfulness, expose it without giving the awfulness clicks.
[38:52.000 --> 38:59.000]  Our real headline, simply ask, is this the final proof that she is a man?
[38:59.000 --> 39:01.000]  You need to decide this for yourself.
[39:01.000 --> 39:05.000]  But after we've been lied to so much, it's not bad to ask questions.
[39:05.000 --> 39:10.000]  I mean, come on, Chelsea, you're in the WikiLeaks telling your parents we're killing Haitians.
[39:10.000 --> 39:14.000]  We stole all the money. They're dying of cholera. Why are we doing this?
[39:14.000 --> 39:29.000]  You know your parents funded the Arab Spring. You know they were engaged and countless other crimes. And so you're in no position as the heir to a major crime family to criticize me for talking about CNN headlines dealing with
[39:29.000 --> 39:34.000]  Joan Rivers saying Michelle Obama's a tranny, especially in light of this new video.
[39:34.000 --> 39:45.000]  So you want to change the subject onto me, public enemy number one, the guy that gets beat up for covering all this, when in truth you should be criticizing CNN, TMZ and everybody else.
[39:45.000 --> 39:48.000]  Because Michelle Obama's got hands way bigger than mine.
[39:48.000 --> 39:57.000]  She's got shoulders wider than mine. She's taller than Obama and she's got a big old Ataconda in her pants.
[39:57.000 --> 40:09.000]  So she's either like spinal tap got a fake, you know, a pickle or something in there, a cucumber that scare the biggest cat you can imagine away, or she's really a tranny.
[40:09.000 --> 40:12.000]  And this has all been a giant blackmail operation against America.
[40:12.000 --> 40:18.000]  But regardless, even though you got millions of fake Twitter followers, we know there's some real ones right there.
[40:18.000 --> 40:22.000]  And no wonder Chelsea, you're telling folks, whatever you do, don't look at the video.
[40:22.000 --> 40:27.000]  That's right. Whatever you do, don't look at the video. That's at info wars.com right now.
[40:27.000 --> 40:34.000]  Because you might have to ask yourself, why did Joan Rivers say she was a tranny, not Alex Jones?
[40:34.000 --> 40:37.000]  And that, my friends, is the rest of the story.
[40:37.000 --> 40:43.000]  Mr. Rivers, how are you? You made you made a ton of news officiating the wedding in New York yesterday.
[40:43.000 --> 40:46.000]  Is this like a is this like a new cottage career move for you?
[40:46.000 --> 40:49.000]  I'm so excited. I should do very well.
[40:49.000 --> 40:54.000]  And do you think that the country will see the first, the United States will see the first gay president or the first woman president?
[40:54.000 --> 40:58.000]  We already have it with Obama, so let's just calm down.
[40:58.000 --> 40:59.000]  Got it.
[40:59.000 --> 41:02.000]  You know Michelle is a tranny.
[41:02.000 --> 41:04.000]  I'm sorry, she's a what?
[41:04.000 --> 41:07.000]  A transgender. We all know.
[41:07.000 --> 41:08.000]  Oh my gosh.
[41:08.000 --> 41:11.000]  Oh God. It's okay.
[41:11.000 --> 41:16.000]  Men and women of the finest military in the world.
[41:16.000 --> 41:20.000]  Most of all, Admiral Mullen.
[41:20.000 --> 41:22.000]  Deborah.
[41:22.000 --> 41:25.000]  Michael and I. Michael and I. Michael and I.
[41:25.000 --> 41:27.000]  Is that anything scary?
[41:27.000 --> 41:34.000]  You know, well, when my mind, when Michelle's mad, when my mind, when Michelle's mad.
[41:34.000 --> 41:50.000]  When my mind, when my mind.
[41:50.000 --> 42:06.000]  When my mind, when my mind.
[42:06.000 --> 42:08.000]  Folks, you've got to see the video for yourself.
[42:08.000 --> 42:10.000]  It was one of the top trending videos last week.
[42:10.000 --> 42:14.000]  So I did a video on it saying, wow, Joan River said it and died.
[42:14.000 --> 42:15.000]  What do you think of this?
[42:15.000 --> 42:21.000]  And maybe she had a sex change to a man, or maybe she's got two rolls of quarters in her pants.
[42:21.000 --> 42:24.000]  The point is, she looks like she's got a cod piece.
[42:24.000 --> 42:31.000]  Now, Chuck Johnson is an investigative journalist, award-winning, amazing contacts.
[42:31.000 --> 42:37.000]  When we come back, his website along with mine has been officially banned from being given to Trump.
[42:37.000 --> 42:40.000]  That has been reported by Bloomberg and others.
[42:40.000 --> 42:48.000]  Break down why this is so important straight ahead and how they're trying to isolate the president with our guest, Chuck Johnson of GotNews.com.
[42:48.000 --> 43:11.000]  Thousands of years ago there was a basic form of chivalry. Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[43:11.000 --> 43:20.000]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[43:20.000 --> 43:24.000]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[43:24.000 --> 43:34.000]  Pathogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[43:34.000 --> 43:49.000]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex. Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[43:49.000 --> 43:58.000]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today. It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands, and it starts at infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[43:58.000 --> 44:05.000]  It's not just our water we need to filter. It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned. It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[44:05.000 --> 44:11.000]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[44:11.000 --> 44:28.000]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure Groundbreaking Water Filtration Systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze. Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job you can to purify your air.
[44:28.000 --> 44:37.000]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects to themselves. The general public doesn't.
[44:37.000 --> 44:52.000]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500. One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean. This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[44:52.000 --> 45:08.000]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today in infowarsstore.com.
[45:23.000 --> 45:30.000]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[45:30.000 --> 45:43.000]  Now in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[45:43.000 --> 45:45.000]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[45:45.000 --> 46:00.000]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen. Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at infowarslife.com, or by calling 888-253-3139.
[46:16.000 --> 46:24.000]  Concentrated peppermint mouthwash, unscented body wash, tea tree shampoo, and long-lasting natural deodorant.

[47:21.000 --> 47:23.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[47:23.000 --> 47:35.000]  Everything turns, turns, turns, like Hurricane Harvey dumping 20 feet of water on Houston and it's sitting over the city, biblically, just like Katrina,
[47:35.000 --> 47:42.000]  but Houston's a lot bigger, 10 million people, New Orleans is like a million, million and a half, whatever it is. This is big.
[47:42.000 --> 47:53.000]  We've got reporters down there, we'll be covering it, alligators and people's front yards, at their front doors, fish swimming around inside people's attics, old folks home,
[47:53.000 --> 48:01.000]  old people floating around knitting while they're floating. This is literally Fox News images. You cannot make up how truth is traded with fiction.
[48:01.000 --> 48:08.000]  Now, Chuck Johnson comes highly recommended by Mike Cernovich and so many other patrons. I've been fully aware for a long time of GotNews.com.
[48:08.000 --> 48:18.000]  He's an independent investigative journalist, author and new media entrepreneur. He is founder of GotNews.com and it's Melania Trump that gave some of your stories that have been proven very accurate.
[48:18.000 --> 48:27.000]  You have a lot of great sources in DC and around the world. We'll get into those as I know some of the same sources and so that that's why they don't want it.
[48:27.000 --> 48:34.000]  I didn't want to try to mount Kelly's out on the wall. I don't want to go to war with these generals, but Roger Stone's going to ride shotgun.
[48:34.000 --> 48:41.000]  We're going to hear the last 30 minutes of the next hour said there is a turn towards war and things, but I'm still totally for Trump because he's trying to get the economy going.
[48:41.000 --> 48:50.000]  He's trying to restore America. He's a real president. Doesn't mean I totally agree with him. We're actually getting a president who isn't a puppet, but you've been telling me so many amazing things just during the break.
[48:50.000 --> 48:57.000]  Chuck Johnson of GotNews.com. We'll get into your lawsuit. It's been successful against Gawker.
[48:57.000 --> 49:10.000]  Peter Tills are doing the same thing. The Wall Street Journal article about it, how we've got to sue these groups. We've got the Family Research Council and we've got the D. James Kennedy Ministries filing suit against the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[49:10.000 --> 49:19.000]  We have to do this because they're not just calling us Nazis. They're putting us in databases where we can't buy and sell like the Nazis literally did.
[49:19.000 --> 49:30.000]  They call us Nazis and then use literal Nazi tactics of first saying you can't engage in commerce or travel. So take over Chuck Johnson because you're a real info warrior behind the scenes.
[49:30.000 --> 49:40.000]  Game changing. Tell us the lay of the land. Chuck Johnson blasted John Kelly for blacklisting info wars and GotNews vows to survive a failed general.
[49:40.000 --> 49:48.000]  Here's another one. Solon, the info war for Donald Trump's mind. Wow, there's a war on for your mind. Where did I hear that before? We're way ahead of them.
[49:48.000 --> 49:59.000]  Yeah, man, it's a great digital civil war taking place right now. And they're very, very afraid of the influence you and I have had in shaping the mind of the President of the United States.
[49:59.000 --> 50:10.000]  And I've got to say, General Kelly, Trump has been sucked into this military industrial complex. He's been sucked into all these crazy kind of neocon wars.
[50:10.000 --> 50:19.000]  Suddenly we're going back to war in Afghanistan. It's all a joke. And right now the biggest fight that we all have to deal with is saving the Internet.
[50:19.000 --> 50:24.000]  And I was sounding the alarm about this two and a half years ago when I was one of the first journalists kicked off of Twitter.
[50:24.000 --> 50:30.000]  And we've now got to finally fight to take back the Internet. And if we don't, elections won't matter.
[50:30.000 --> 50:35.000]  And Trump is being isolated by a bunch of people who do not have his interests at heart. They have their own interests.
[50:35.000 --> 50:44.000]  And we've got to fight back. And I've got to say, General Kelly is trying to stop Melania Trump, the first lady of the United States, from sharing articles with her husband.
[50:44.000 --> 50:45.000]  And this is admitted.
[50:45.000 --> 50:46.000]  This is admitted, yeah.
[50:46.000 --> 50:53.000]  There's so condescending about the President and his wife and Donald Jr. Like we elected him, we didn't elect them.
[50:53.000 --> 51:02.000]  Right. And Melania Trump is literally handing articles about how Katie Walsh was leaking. She was the deputy chief of staff.
[51:02.000 --> 51:08.000]  And she was fired for what we uncovered. We exposed Mike Short, also fired.
[51:08.000 --> 51:11.000]  So we've been getting the scalps of the leakers.
[51:11.000 --> 51:16.000]  And of course, you guys along with Psobic broke three weeks ago this ban, which they now admit.
[51:16.000 --> 51:20.000]  Yep. Yep. No, what they're trying to do now is they're all trying to put us into the digital gulag.
[51:20.000 --> 51:27.000]  And so that's why the next fight that's over the FTC is going to be so important over keeping the Internet free.
[51:27.000 --> 51:29.000]  And we've got to go to war with Google. We've got to go to war.
[51:29.000 --> 51:33.000]  I agree. Trump needs to go to war with them. And that's why they don't want us communicating with him.
[51:33.000 --> 51:38.000]  He's got to use his monopoly, the power to break up monopolies now. We need Teddy Roosevelt part two.
[51:38.000 --> 51:42.000]  Yeah. And it's obvious they would have banned him from Twitter. I mean, the CEO of Twitter.
[51:42.000 --> 51:43.000]  They had discussions of it.
[51:43.000 --> 51:45.000]  Yeah. They've talked about it, talked about it openly.
[51:45.000 --> 51:50.000]  Now, look, my attitude on this is really simple. If you're a monopoly, you can't discriminate against people.
[51:50.000 --> 51:56.000]  If you want to be a bakery shop and not allow the gays to have cakes.
[51:56.000 --> 52:01.000]  Apparently, that's a civil rights issue. But if you want to express yourself on the Internet, you can't do that anymore.
[52:01.000 --> 52:05.000]  And they'll spend it and go, we're banning gays and cakes. I'd bake the cake. I'm not against them.
[52:05.000 --> 52:11.000]  The point is, how does anybody else that's like free market or a Bitcoin guy or whatever, how do we get banned?
[52:11.000 --> 52:14.000]  Well, we're fighting back right now. We've got to set up new payment processors.
[52:14.000 --> 52:17.000]  We've got to go against PayPal. We've got to go against Stripe.
[52:17.000 --> 52:19.000]  And eventually we've got to start bringing lawsuits.
[52:19.000 --> 52:21.000]  I know you're doing that in defamation side. I've done that.
[52:21.000 --> 52:25.000]  We were gearing up. We don't just file suits. I'm in lawyer meetings constantly.
[52:25.000 --> 52:28.000]  Yeah. And we're in a war and the war is over the soul of the country.
[52:28.000 --> 52:34.000]  And they don't want to accept the Trump revolution, the peer-to-peer revolution of the people really taking back the president.
[52:34.000 --> 52:39.000]  Well, think about it. D. James Kennedy, my late grandmother loved him and watched him.
[52:39.000 --> 52:46.000]  This is milk toast, Christian mainline stuff. They're banned from selling stuff on Amazon listed as a Nazi group.
[52:46.000 --> 52:50.000]  Of course, they're suing. I mean, this is insane.
[52:50.000 --> 52:59.000]  S.B.L.C. is a con game. It's designed to scare a bunch of rich Jews by other Jews saying that the Confederacy is going to come back and get you all.
[52:59.000 --> 53:04.000]  And it's really disgusting. Now, I will say, General Kelly, Trump has kind of sucked into all this general thing.
[53:04.000 --> 53:09.000]  You know, my grandfather was a rear admiral. You can look him up. Dwight Lyman Johnson, Navy cross winner.
[53:09.000 --> 53:14.000]  I've been around military men my whole life, but the military is not some perfect institution.
[53:14.000 --> 53:16.000]  It's made up of humans who have biases.
[53:16.000 --> 53:21.000]  Well, I like the grassroots fighters, but as you go up into the higher ranks, that's not the place to admire.
[53:21.000 --> 53:24.000]  But sniffing the generals is not the way to go.
[53:24.000 --> 53:28.000]  They purged all the alpha males out of the military. Eric Prince and I were talking about this in Wyoming.
[53:28.000 --> 53:32.000]  They just removed them all in the 1980s and 90s, and they just stepped it up.
[53:32.000 --> 53:38.000]  Exactly. They're bringing in the robots and autonomous systems. There's a war against humanity, and you start with men.
[53:38.000 --> 53:45.000]  Right. You remove the men, and then you can replace them with trans or robots or whatever, and then killing becomes just as easy as being a part of a video game.
[53:45.000 --> 53:48.000]  And so that's where we're going. That's the dehumanization of the war.
[53:48.000 --> 53:50.000]  Because they want to be able to give orders that people are going to follow.
[53:50.000 --> 53:54.000]  That's right. That's right. And of course, the military is something that scares them, right?
[53:54.000 --> 53:59.000]  Because the military is something that's actually about restoring the country and preserving their...
[53:59.000 --> 54:03.000]  Well, it's human. And the globalists believe they're going to transcend all this.
[54:03.000 --> 54:10.000]  So let's expand on this. When Eric Prince or all the folks you talked to, the military is almost totally away against the globalist agenda now.
[54:10.000 --> 54:16.000]  We've had that victory. I don't see, even if they're able to kill Trump or start a race war,
[54:16.000 --> 54:21.000]  Helter's Keltter Styles are currently trying to do. It's a total twilight zone, incredibly entertaining and interesting.
[54:21.000 --> 54:26.000]  I mean, if it wasn't so real, I mean, this is edge of your seats every day. We're in the middle of it.
[54:26.000 --> 54:33.000]  And don't they get the Streisand effect of saying, we're banning God News and Info Wars and the homophobe Milo.
[54:33.000 --> 54:36.000]  The homophobe Milo. So he makes gay jokes. He's gay.
[54:36.000 --> 54:41.000]  I mean, it's just no one's buying it and it makes us totally avant-garde.
[54:41.000 --> 54:44.000]  So I don't get what they think they're doing.
[54:44.000 --> 54:49.000]  Well, what they're trying to do is they're trying to isolate the president and basically take away the source of his power, which is the people.
[54:49.000 --> 54:54.000]  And we see this when he goes up in front of these rallies, like in Arizona or in West Virginia.
[54:54.000 --> 54:57.000]  And he's really like, he gets alive with the crowd. And that's what they're trying to do.
[54:57.000 --> 55:00.000]  That's his fireside chat.
[55:00.000 --> 55:03.000]  That's his fireside chat. That's his morning in America.
[55:03.000 --> 55:10.000]  Trump has done with Twitter and with these live streams, what Reagan did with television, what Coolidge did with radio.
[55:10.000 --> 55:14.000]  He's a real master of the technology of our era. And that's why he has to be destroyed.
[55:14.000 --> 55:16.000]  And that's why the technology companies can't permit it.
[55:16.000 --> 55:21.000]  Because he really, they call him mentally ill because he wants to represent the people and that everybody win.
[55:21.000 --> 55:28.000]  These parasites see that as ill because they're ill and they see somebody else that actually sees others rising and gets off on it.
[55:28.000 --> 55:31.000]  They see that as sociopaths and parasites as sick.
[55:31.000 --> 55:37.000]  No, it's exactly right. And I was with Julian Assange 10 days ago in Congressman Dana Rohrbacher.
[55:37.000 --> 55:44.000]  And one of Julian Assange's associates, his right-hand guy, told me the day after the election that the deep state was not going to permit Trump,
[55:44.000 --> 55:48.000]  that they were going to have a coup against him and that they were going to silence him and all those supporters.
[55:48.000 --> 55:54.000]  And I hear from sources of mine at Facebook, at Google, that the purge is on, that the head of the 20th...
[55:54.000 --> 56:01.000]  Oh, the revolution's on. I mean, they've said, they've had Phil Mudd, former deputy director of the CIA say, we're going to kill the president.
[56:01.000 --> 56:05.000]  And my dad, everybody else just says, why is that guy still walking around?
[56:05.000 --> 56:09.000]  I mean, you say, I'm going to kill the president and you formally have done stuff like that?
[56:09.000 --> 56:14.000]  I mean, that is, man, Trump has full authorization to move against these people.
[56:14.000 --> 56:17.000]  Well, you know, Trump right now has a real problem.
[56:17.000 --> 56:20.000]  The problem he's got is he doesn't know who his people are yet.
[56:20.000 --> 56:22.000]  He doesn't know how to reward loyalty.
[56:22.000 --> 56:25.000]  But the globalists know, so they're trying to cut us off.
[56:25.000 --> 56:28.000]  That's right. They're cutting us off and doing things like putting Mike Pompeo at CIA.
[56:28.000 --> 56:34.000]  And of course, he keeps all the John Brennan guys in, doing things like McMaster, who's a tool of Paul Singer,
[56:34.000 --> 56:38.000]  and he's a tool of some of the big globalist GOP donors.
[56:38.000 --> 56:41.000]  These are bad things. These are bad things and they need to be stopped.
[56:41.000 --> 56:48.000]  Is it surreal for you, Chuck Johnson, of GotNews.com, to turn on the news on every channel and they're saying, Chuck Johnson,
[56:48.000 --> 56:52.000]  the wife of the president dared give him an article. This is insane.
[56:52.000 --> 56:56.000]  And so we're banning that and Chuck Johnson's evil. What is that like?
[56:56.000 --> 56:59.000]  Well, look, I mean, I've done very well in my short life. I'm 28.
[56:59.000 --> 57:03.000]  You know, 10 years ago today, I came to California with 50 bucks. I'm doing quite well for myself.
[57:03.000 --> 57:07.000]  You know, I have nothing to give the country but my life and my fortune.
[57:07.000 --> 57:08.000]  America's a great place.
[57:08.000 --> 57:10.000]  It's a great place. And you know, it's worth fighting.
[57:10.000 --> 57:11.000]  Magic.
[57:11.000 --> 57:12.000]  It's worth dying for, you know.
[57:12.000 --> 57:13.000]  And if it.
[57:13.000 --> 57:14.000]  There's other places you don't get this freedom.
[57:14.000 --> 57:16.000]  No, you don't. And you know, it's precious.
[57:16.000 --> 57:20.000]  It could be taken from us and they're trying to take it from us right now using, you know, using all these trust and
[57:20.000 --> 57:23.000]  safeties, SPLC crap. It's got to be, we got to fight.
[57:23.000 --> 57:26.000]  Well, we've got a list of who's not allowed to be online now.
[57:26.000 --> 57:29.000]  That's Chinese style communist censorship.
[57:29.000 --> 57:34.000]  We'll be back with GotNews.com head Chuck Johnson to break down so much.
[57:34.000 --> 57:37.000]  But the lawsuits are being launched to counter strike.
[57:37.000 --> 57:39.000]  All of you should sue too when they censor you.
[57:39.000 --> 57:40.000]  Spread the word.
[57:40.000 --> 57:44.000]  Second hour coming up infowars.com forward slash show.
[57:44.000 --> 57:49.000]  Stay with us.
[57:49.000 --> 57:54.000]  After being sold out for months, our best selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at infowarsstore.com.
[57:54.000 --> 57:56.000]  Research across the board is clear.
[57:56.000 --> 58:01.000]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[58:01.000 --> 58:08.000]  That's why the last surgeon generals report on oral health warrants that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[58:08.000 --> 58:15.000]  Super blue fluoride free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula. It's loaded with good halogen iodide, some of the bad halogen fluoride.
[58:15.000 --> 58:22.000]  Super blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[58:22.000 --> 58:30.000]  Just some of the ingredients in super blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodide, nano silver and more.
[58:30.000 --> 58:35.000]  Due to requests from listeners who found that spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children.
[58:35.000 --> 58:39.000]  We have created the new bubble gum flavored super blue that is spearmint free.
[58:39.000 --> 58:44.000]  Learn more about the new bubble gum flavored super blue toothpaste and more at infowarslife.com.

[58:58.000 --> 58:59.000]  A 360 win.

[59:06.000 --> 59:14.000]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for auto ship because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[59:14.000 --> 59:19.000]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[59:19.000 --> 59:25.000]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[59:25.000 --> 59:33.000]  Just go to infowarsstore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[59:33.000 --> 59:40.000]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win and with the new auto ship feature at infowarslife.com, this is a sure win.
[59:40.000 --> 59:41.000]  10% off on auto ship.
[59:41.000 --> 59:45.000]  Win, win, win at infowarslife.com, free shipping on orders above $50.
[59:45.000 --> 59:50.000]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[59:50.000 --> 59:55.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:58.000 --> 59:59.000]  You have the power.
[59:59.000 --> 1:00:01.000]  Humanity has the power.
[1:00:01.000 --> 1:00:03.000]  We have the power.
[1:00:03.000 --> 1:00:04.000]  Do you want to fight?
[1:00:04.000 --> 1:00:06.000]  You better believe you got one.
[1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:13.000]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:32.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  Chuck Johnson, an interesting guy with GotNews.com is here.
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  It was in the news that his website, because Melania Trump likes it, and of course ours, infowars.com and now newswars.com, that's banned getting the president.
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:47.000]  Well, they can't ban him getting a cell phone and calling people on the telephone.
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  Not yet, not yet.
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  Well, they're trying.
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  We've seen it.
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  So coming up, you're going to get into the lawsuits.
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:56.000]  We're not litigious just to have fun.
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  They're trying to put us in databases and then say, we can't be involved in commerce or have credit cards or have shopping cards.
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:08.000]  I mean, this is literal Jewish ghetto stuff from Nazi Germany.
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  Everybody overuses Nazi stuff.
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  This is what it is.
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  Yeah, it's digital serfdom, man.
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  They have their five companies, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft.
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  They're acting as kingdoms and they're screwing anyone who stands in their way.
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  And of course-
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  And that's why Drudge properly here called it digital gulags.
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  They're digital gulags, and some of them were designed in East Germany, like the one that Facebook uses, some of their technology.
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  They even hired former Stasi Hilo.
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  No, I mean, people think that you're a lot-
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  It sounds insane.
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  It's-
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  Like, go on there and Google it if it hasn't been purged from Google yet.
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  It sounds insane, though.
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  That former Stasi deputy chief has been hired to run Facebook's system to watch up conservatives.
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:50.000]  You're like, really?
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  No, I mean, look, you know, we did the fundraiser for James DeMore, who was that Google engineer who was fired for basically saying that men and women are different.
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  And a lot of people I knew within Google who were friends of mine, software developers,
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:02.000]  they didn't think he would be fired.
[1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  They thought he was just a very reasonable guy.
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  There's a war on reality.
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  And he was fired.
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  So, like, this is the world we're entering now, where these kingdoms, these monopolies-
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  It's a real game of thrones.
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  It really is.
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  So the attack is on, though.
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  I mean, it's happening.
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  It is.
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:18.000]  And, you know, there's going to be a counterattack now.
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  I mean, all of these companies are bigger than mob bell was when it was broken up.
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  They're behaving in monopolistic, anti-competitive measures.
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  I know Ted Cruz and others have gone after some of the tech companies, Congressman Rohrbacher has, too.
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  And we're going to start having hearings about that.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  Yeah, Rohrbacher's a champion.
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  Because they all said, oh, we're utilities.
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  But now that they've got power, they're like, oh, we're going to-
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  Yeah, we're private corporations until we're not, right?
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  We get all these benefits of government policy, but we're not monopolies.
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  I mean, it's just-
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  Yeah, we're going to let everything cross over with child porn.
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  But, oh, we're going to ban shihad watch that plays videos of jihadists saying we're going to kill Christians and Jews.
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  I mean, that is a site doing a service banned off of PayPal last week.
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  Yeah, I mean, they do this all the time.
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  And PayPal has gotten even crazier.
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  I mean, PayPal, which was started by Peter Thiel as this company to be free and to allow people to have money.
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  He has nothing to do with it these days, I'm told.
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  But the company has moved in a very corporate-
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  And the way they do this is they have these things called the trust and safety councils, which are all led by these-
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  That's right. Oh, we didn't do it.
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  A SPLC council told us.
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  Yes, and of course, they give money to them. I mean, as you saw, Apple has talked about-
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:32.000]  So they fence the lie. Apple, Google, give them money to the group to then put out the BS report.
[1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  Yeah, and they even get a tax deduction for it because the SPLC is a total fraudulent organization, total fraudulent charity.
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  And we've been going against them, crowdfunding against them for lawsuits, and we'll be stepping it up in the near future.
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  And by the way, I announced today I'm going to probably shoot Tom Brokaw and all of them, not because I want to. I have to.
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  Yeah, I mean, look, what they do is they call you a Nazi, and if you don't pay attention, suddenly you're a Nazi and suddenly all your payment processors are revoked.
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:03:58.000]  And then somebody punches you in the face or pours coffee on you.
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  Yeah, I mean, it happens all the time now. And this has become so crazy where they publish people's home addresses, they show up, they threaten you, they do denial of service attacks.
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:10.000]  All these things are things that have actually happened to me.
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  Me too.
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  I mean, it's crazy. And you think of it like other tech companies don't have to deal with this stuff, other media companies don't have to deal with this stuff.
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  So what they're trying to do is they're trying to reduce us into digital serfs, and they're trying to basically ghettoize us and to basically make it so we have no power and no influence.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  That's right. I said Gulag. Drudge said he used the term of the digital internet ghetto.
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  Internet ghettos. Yeah.
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  Yeah. And then this is the way they restrict our power and our influence in the country.
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  But we're fighting back everything that was.
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  I gotta say, though, it's bold. I mean, you know, Tom Brokaw saying everybody's a Nazi disagrees with the government.
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  I mean, that is crazy.
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  Oh, it's bold, but it's also a sign of weakness. It's a sign that the last taboo they have is the Nazi taboo. Can't call us racist anymore.
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  They already played that card.
[1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:56.000]  Exactly.
[1:04:56.000 --> 1:05:06.000]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[1:05:06.000 --> 1:05:08.000]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield.
[1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:11.000]  Toxic, metal, and chemical defense support.
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:19.000]  It's made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the infomer.
[1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:21.000]  It is a classical 360 win.
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:25.000]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:31.000]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:48.000]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:51.000]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[1:05:51.000 --> 1:06:01.000]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield.
[1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:26.000]  He was breaking it down during the break. Repeat that to people. Get into the lawsuits.
[1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:27.000]  Go ahead.
[1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:30.000]  Yeah, I mean, look, you know, we've got to fight back on as many fronts as possible.
[1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:39.000]  And what you were doing is you were basically throughout your career, you've been asking people to think for themselves, to draw their own conclusions, to think, to basically be active and engaged.
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:42.000]  But now what we have to do is we have to fight for the freedom to do that on the Internet.
[1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:46.000]  And we also have to fight for your freedom to spend your money as you see fit on the Internet.
[1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  I've been going after the brain and now we have to go through the delivery systems and the financials.
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  The wallet is so important. I mean, it's a human right to be able to spend your money, your hard earned labor as you see fit.
[1:06:55.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  And of course, when these companies like PayPal and others try to steal your money or shut down your accounts, they are violating an essential part of what it means to be human, to be charitable, to be able to give money to certain people.
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:10.000]  If they say you support Trump, we're going to ban you. That is outrageous civil rights violation.
[1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  Sure. And you know, look at people like, I mean, Palmer Lucky, the guy who founded Oculus, he went from a trailer park to selling his company for $2.8 billion.
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:28.000]  And he got kicked out of Facebook. He got fired from Facebook after Facebook acquired his company for giving $10,000 to a pro-Trump meme operation.
[1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:38.000]  So this is serious stuff. You know, you saw Peter Thiel was attacked recently by Reed Hastings, the CEO of Netflix, who tried to get him kicked off the board of Facebook.
[1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  This is a company he was an angel investor in, gave $500,000 for. I mean, this stuff is like, it's stepping up.
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  They're going, it used to be they would just fire like a lone engineer. Oh, they're, it's a hundred times what it was before. This is the main assault.
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  This is the main assault. And it's a war of billionaire against billionaire. You know, you said earlier, Game of Thrones, it is like a digital game of thrones.
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  And it's a cold, electronic civil war that's taking place on the Internet, and now increasingly spilling out into our streets, like with Charlottesville and with some of the Black Lives Matter protesters, you know, destroying cities and destroying statues.
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  And sort of openly funding them to cop kill. And the media goes, well, cops are bad. So they die. It's like the opposite of Martin Luther King, like cops are all bad.
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:26.000]  They're wearing blue. Kill them. And the whites are all bad because they're white. And they end up being a virtue signal. Most of the minorities aren't even buying it.
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  It's like weird college white people brain bugging around trying to cause a civil war, like playing at 20th century communists.
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  Now, I got to tell you, so I've become very good friends with George Zimmerman over the years, because I think he was patient zero for a lot of this craziness.
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:46.000]  And I've been around George and I've had Black guys come up, shake his hand, thank him for defending the Second Amendment.
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:52.000]  And it's always these crazy white college students are slightly out of college people who attack George.
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  So yeah, there's something weird and sick going on in our, through the Internet and also through the colleges. And it's stepping up.
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:06.000]  They, you know, what they, the demand, as I've said before, the demand for Nazis vastly exceeds their supply on the Internet.
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  And so what they're doing right now is making everyone into a Nazi so they can justify attacking them and hurting them.
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:18.000]  Meanwhile, we want life extension technology, a future, everybody together. We want prosperity, just like Trump does.
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  That's why we're bad, because we're not the parasites using this to manipulate and joining them.
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  Well, we want to free people's minds so that we can hope that they free their souls, right? Like, that's what we're about.
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  We're about freedom. We're about trying to convince people, persuade them. We're not about broadcasting and stepping on people.
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  Yeah, we don't use the IRS like MSNBC five years ago goes. Of course we're arresting the preachers and shutting down right wingers.
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:50.000]  You don't get tax exemption only we do. And then bragging your kids belong to us. I have the videos. It's like, this is a cult.
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  Why are they so arrogant? Why do they think in America they're going to get away with a communist Chinese style net censorship?
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:04.000]  Well, because they've succeeded thus far. No one has fought back yet until a few of us have shown up and said enough's enough.
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  I mean, look, I love private companies. I have a few private companies myself. I believe in the right of people to form their own companies.
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  But we do have laws in this country for a reason. We do have trust busting for a reason.
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  And a lot of us are having to learn now that there are think companies that are too big. The banks became too big to fail, which put us into a recession.
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  Obama helped him set up monopolies for the big five, like you said. And Trump needs to bust them up. Not for us. We don't need him to do it for us like the left does.
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  Because we're not even Republican or liberal or conservative. We're pro-human. Just get things out of our way. We'll win.
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  But don't think you're going to destroy us and not have us take your ass out politically.
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  Yeah, I mean, look, Eric Schmidt went to the White House 275 times during Obama's time there. He's a former CEO.
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  Hillary was with Google every day controlling her searches.
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  Yep, Sergey Brin. So what I find interesting is so James D'Amour gets fired as a Google engineer. He gets fired for writing a memo, a 10-page memo, saying that he made women feel uncomfortable.
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  Well, Sergey Brin, Larry Page, and Eric Schmidt all had sexual relationships with subordinates. You can look it up.
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  We wrote it at Got News. We went through all the history on it. And yet there was no problem there. There was no conflicts of interest.
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:16.000]  It's all about hurting the little people and giving themselves their own things.
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  Political correctness is only for little people.
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  That's right. And eventually we've got to, you know, this is where we're going now and where things are getting is the people who are getting together.
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  Nerds are allying with, you know, with jocks. I mean, the public at large is rising up. And what's going to happen is if they're not careful with this internet stuff,
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  or this censorship, it's going to turn violent. And it's going to turn violent very, very soon, unfortunately.
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  And what's crazy is they're not even empowering women. You look at who writes the comedy and who's the executives.
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  They're actually more male than any other place, whereas like Trump or other folks are way more, we're looking for people who just want to do the job.
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  It's total platitudes. They could care less about women.
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  No, it's all about power. It's all about power. It's all a shell game. It's like a three-card Monte game of getting power.
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  They use the blacks. They use the minorities. They use the trans. It's all about using people to come.
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  It's a permanent state of making people feel uncomfortable so that they can take power.
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  People go, why are they saying the Eclipse is racist? Or why are they saying a guy named Robert Lee who's Asian can't work at ESPN anymore
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  because it scares people. It's meant to be crazy. We're just everything is racism.
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:34.000]  So you're just a gibbering mental patient who's cut out of the political process.
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  Yes, it's about making you so you're not a part of it. You can't be a part of the discourse.
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  Whereas Trump's like, let's love each other, free market, open society, let's be inclusive, let's win together.
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  That's so Martin Luther King compared to what they're saying. No, you get ahead because of what color you are.
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  You get in a group, a gang, we run, then you're going to get ahead.
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  No, you just got chips on your shoulder and are so mentally ill, nobody can hire you.
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  That's right. And of course, like Trump is sort of the return of the white alpha male, right?
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:08.000]  If you're under 30 and you're a white guy growing up, you're constantly told by the universities by everything that you're a terrible person.
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  You have white privilege that you're bad. And of course, a lot of us are.
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  Because it was white male driven Western Europe that ended slavery, so we did it.
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:17.000]  Yeah, I mean, it's always whites that are the villain right now.
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  And I've had friends who've come from South Africa.
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:24.000]  That's not minorities directing that, though. Why is the elite directing it at white males?
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  Because I guess that's the group they still see as dominant.
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  So they want to henpeck them into lying because it's always big super alpha males are telling everybody else the other white males are the bad guys.
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:38.000]  Yeah, I mean, that's basically how it works. It's a war among billionaires for market share, for dominance.
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:40.000]  So it's just cold-blooded eugenics, basically.
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  And to a certain extent. Yeah, to a certain extent.
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  I think what really starts to happen with people, though, is they start to wake up.
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  They start to realize, you know, when they go to the school is like, why am I paying $50,000 a year to be told, like, I'm a racist?
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:56.000]  Why can't I just go and start a tech company? But of course, now they're trying to stop you from being able to start tech companies.
[1:13:56.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  And that's why they're pissed because almost everybody successful didn't go to college.
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  And I'm not knocking if you went. Why is it almost everyone that didn't go is successful?
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  Yeah, it's a great question. And why is it?
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  Because we went, oh, we're going to go around this.
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  One of the things that I thought about recently is, you know, what if I could have a conversation with my 16-year-old self?
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  You know, would I say go to college? I mean, I did very well in my SATs. I was a very good student.
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  Why did I do the whole college thing and put myself into a weaker position when everyone now is dropping out and starting companies and doing well for themselves?
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  So what you said during the break, this is a sign of weakness. Spend a minute on that.
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:36.000]  Yeah, so my general sense is that the fact that the media and everyone is using the Nazi thing, that's the last taboo that they have.
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:40.000]  There's a great essay by venture capitalist Paul Graham called What You Can't Say.
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  And he says, anytime you hear an is statement like that's sexist, that's communist, that's papist.
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:46.000]  Conspiracy theorist.
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  Yeah, conspiracy theorist. It's always just reflecting the taboo.
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:50.000]  Sexist.
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  Sexist is not, I mean, and so what they're doing is they're reflecting the taboo.
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:54.000]  And they're big taboo.
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:56.000]  If anything, I'm discriminatory against men. I like women.
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  Me too, man. You and me both.
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:00.000]  I'll put women all in charge.
[1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:04.000]  Yeah, I mean, look at, you know, Roger Ailes once told me, unfortunately, you know, deceased now.
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:08.000]  He once told me that the secret, the secret to Fox News was bright colors and beautiful women.
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:12.000]  And then they act like he was being mean to women, but he's the one that brought women on the TV.
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  Yeah, and I don't,
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  There's $20 million. I get he was a creeper, whatever.
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  No, I don't believe that.
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  Probably wasn't. I think they didn't stand out. The point is, is that who actually put women in charge.
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  Oh, absolutely. He promoted them, built whole careers for them.
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  I mean, look at what he did for Megan Kelly and how she stabbed him in the back.
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  Because he hugged her too hard once.
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  I guess.
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:34.000]  She's like, you've paid me $80 million, asshole. How dare you?
[1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  How dare you?
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:37.000]  You squeezed me at a Christmas party too hard.
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  Man, where to begin on some of that?
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  Talk about lifting a gift horse in the mouth.
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  Well, let's come back then.
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  Let's come back and let's get into the next wave, the lawsuits to counter this.
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:16:18.000]  Because I mean business, but all of you should follow lawsuits too. Seriously.
[1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:54.000]  Let's get into the next wave.
[1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:44.000]  Let's get into the next wave.
[1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:54.000]  Let's get into the next wave.
[1:18:14.000 --> 1:18:39.000]  Let's get into the next wave.
[1:18:39.000 --> 1:18:55.000]  Let's get into the next wave.
[1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:34.000]  Let's get into the next wave.
[1:19:34.000 --> 1:20:03.000]  Let's get into the next wave.
[1:20:04.000 --> 1:20:31.000]  Let's get into the next wave.
[1:20:31.000 --> 1:20:36.000]  So, in case you didn't know, the fight for the open free Internet is on.
[1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:43.000]  And the Democrats, the globalists, the Republican establishment admit they want to strangle the populist movement that Trump is a manifestation of.
[1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:51.000]  And if you read the Financial Times or Atlantic Monthly or more elite globalist publications, they say everybody hates us.
[1:20:51.000 --> 1:20:56.000]  Our authoritarian world government plans falling apart. The tide's going on on us. What are we going to do?
[1:20:56.000 --> 1:21:01.000]  When you read WikiLeaks, they say race war, race war, kill Trump, have a race war.
[1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:08.000]  They say use demographics, use culture war. It doesn't mean there isn't real cultural issues or problems or beefs on all sides.
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:12.000]  The cold-blooded globalist, might as well be the big spaceship, you know, the high tech above us.
[1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:16.000]  I'm not saying they're alien, but it's like that, is turning us against each other.
[1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:19.000]  We should be smart enough to come together.
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:24.000]  But I've said this, I don't want to see Tom Brokoff, who says Alex Jones is a complete racist.
[1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:26.000]  And then doesn't show where I said it.
[1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:34.000]  And then they put me in a database and go, oh, your ad role account for five million to fund your whole operation next year.
[1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  All our expansion money gone.
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  Oh, you're banned off this new credit card thing. Oh, you're banned here. Oh, you're a bigot here.
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:47.000]  It says here, it's certified. You're a bigot, SPLC. Why, they're the, they're the, they're the God.
[1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:53.000]  I've not been convicted of anything. They misrepresent who I am, lie about me all day, make crap up.
[1:21:53.000 --> 1:21:58.000]  And now I'm supposed to just roll over. They have to know I don't want to sue them.
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:04.000]  But if you talk about biblical, I was always growing up in church hearing about, you won't be able to buy or sell if you're a Christian.
[1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:08.000]  I thought, well, I would just have money or cash. They go, no, it'll be digital computer.
[1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:16.000]  And now here it is. So whether the God's real or not, you can't debate that they're using that template of the mark of the beast.
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:24.000]  Is this not Chuck Johnson? I've got news.com banned from the, from Melania Trump. She gives your news daily to the president.
[1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:32.000]  You know, Donnie Jr. gives my news to him, your news. We're, this is an honor. We're the first banned by the mark of the beast.
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:37.000]  Well, I got to say that they were, the media freaked out because they didn't think Trump was going to win.
[1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:42.000]  And then those of us who believed he could win or would win, we had better sources in the Trump world.
[1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:46.000]  And so now they're trying to deny us those sources. They're trying to deny us.
[1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:50.000]  Exactly. First we were lying about the sources. Now they have the sources.
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  Now, and now they're trying to take them from us, which, you know, I got to say, general, with all due respect to General Kelly, you know, the generals in this country have lost pretty much every war we've been in since Vietnam.
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:01.000]  And now you're fighting Americans.
[1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:09.000]  And now what they're doing is they're attacking us. And look, as I said in the thing, you know, Kelly is a failed general by every objective measure.
[1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:12.000]  Afghanistan, 16 years of war, 17 years of war.
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:20.000]  Trump likes him because the border patrol is not failed. When the gloves were taken off, 69% reduction in criminals. But that's their work, not Kelly's.
[1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:21.000]  That's right.
[1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:27.000]  And that's Trump did that, not Kelly. See how he's giving Kelly the credit? We should do stories about Trump is responsible, not Kelly.
[1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:33.000]  Yeah. I mean, look at how Trump actually governs. He tweets stuff out. He pardons people. He reverses bans with Twitter.
[1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:36.000]  I mean, this is as it should be. The idea of a president.
[1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:38.000]  Oh, they're so pissed that he's leading from the front.
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:42.000]  It's fantastic. He should do not since Alexander the Great. Have we seen that?
[1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:48.000]  This is how presidents behave. This is how kings behave. Good kings, not bad kings, which is, of course, why we fought a raid.
[1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:50.000]  They lead from the front. They lead to keep rolling.
[1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:59.000]  And so I got to say, you know, my attitude is I have, I have met Trump in 2011. We actually were just discussing the birth certificate issue back in the day.
[1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:02.000]  And of course, I think it's great that he pardoned our Pio.
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:08.000]  But what's happening now, what's really freaking them out is that we have better access to the halls of power than they do.
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:10.000]  And we don't use it for bad things.
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:16.000]  And not just the exact. We don't use it for ourselves and not just there. Everybody knows we don't burn our sources.
[1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:19.000]  We really care about it. So the good guys now have a place to go.
[1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:23.000]  That's right. And we love them. I mean, look, I'd go to prison for any of my sources.
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:27.000]  I mean, this is a sacred obligation that God has put in our trust.
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:30.000]  I mean, you and I have an obligation as people who are new media entrepreneurs.
[1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:32.000]  Cernovich is awesome. I know you love him. I love him too.
[1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:37.000]  But whenever I was talking about Donnie Jr. and him, they're like, they're people like, why does he give up a source?
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:39.000]  I already knew the enemy already knew all about it.
[1:24:39.000 --> 1:24:41.000]  It's kind of like they knew about our memos to Trump.
[1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:46.000]  It's what a certain point we got until the public. Okay, yes, it's happening because they already know.
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:50.000]  So I never give up sources until 100%. They already know it's kind of like a sign.
[1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:56.000]  We know that his source was, you know, who we know got killed that he still won't say it because he won't give out a source.
[1:24:56.000 --> 1:24:57.000]  But the enemy knows.
[1:24:57.000 --> 1:25:00.000]  As I told you, I met with him for three and a half hours.
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:07.000]  It was Congressman Rohrbacher in London, I guess, 10 days ago on Friday or on Wednesday, a few back.
[1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:10.000]  And we met with him and he wants to do a deal with Trump.
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  He wants to cut a deal with Trump.
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:13.000]  He needs to be pardoned right now.
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:14.000]  He needs to be pardoned.
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  And his sources need to be pardoned because this was a real deal inside operation.
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:20.000]  Can you imagine?
[1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:21.000]  I didn't get it from the Russians.
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:22.000]  And here's the deal.
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:29.000]  If Trump brought Assange in out of the dark, then out of the cold, then Assange can actually give the president the sources,
[1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:31.000]  bring the sources in and protect them.
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:32.000]  And it ain't the Russians.
[1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  It's the CIA.
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:34.000]  It's the NSA.
[1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:35.000]  It's the FBI.
[1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:37.000]  Look, there are billions of dollars.
[1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:40.000]  Just like the secret service told us, follow Hillary.
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  She falls down over 45 minutes.
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:43.000]  Yes, and we caught it.
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:44.000]  Yeah, cut it on camera.
[1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:45.000]  It was fantastic.
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:46.000]  Sorry, go ahead.
[1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:50.000]  Yeah, you know, what's happening now is we're at war with the intelligence agencies because they want to keep people stupid,
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:54.000]  whereas we want to keep them enlightened and keep them educated and have them draw their own conclusions.
[1:25:54.000 --> 1:25:56.000]  We want our kids to grow up with other folks.
[1:25:56.000 --> 1:26:01.000]  And so, you know, Congressman Rohrbacher, who is the poorest white member of Congress, he's a real public servant,
[1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:03.000]  and he and I went to go meet Assange to see for ourselves.
[1:26:03.000 --> 1:26:04.000]  I want to get him on.
[1:26:04.000 --> 1:26:05.000]  He's awesome.
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:06.000]  He's the man.
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:07.000]  He's been on before.
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:08.000]  He's great.
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:11.000]  And, you know, he's a 70-year-old guy, pays for his trip out of his own pocket to go there.
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:12.000]  I did too.
[1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:19.000]  And we went there and we met with Assange, and Assange conclusively demonstrated to us that the Russians were not involved at all.
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  But, of course, our entire intelligence agencies, you know, you can't, can't argue with intelligence,
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:25.000]  even though you could.
[1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:29.000]  Which it turned out, only three of the 17 gave partial evidence.
[1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:32.000]  That was fake news, but, political fact, there was no 17.
[1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:33.000]  There was no consensus.
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:35.000]  And whatever somebody says, there's a consensus on anything.
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  Like global warming.
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:37.000]  On global, on anything.
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:40.000]  But you should really, really hold your wallet and hold your nose,
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:42.000]  because those people are trying to sell you fraud.
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:44.000]  They're saying, the thought process is over.
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:47.000]  This is the Lamborghini you're getting, and it's a penta.
[1:26:47.000 --> 1:26:50.000]  But for years, I was attacked over Senator Robert Menendez.
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:53.000]  My team broke the story about him with the underage hookers.
[1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:54.000]  I remember.
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  For years, we were attacked.
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:26:59.000]  And I said, publicly, I said, when Menendez goes to jail, I will be there.
[1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:01.000]  I will be there to see him go to jail.
[1:27:01.000 --> 1:27:03.000]  And I'm not burning my sources in the FBI.
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:06.000]  The FBI later came out and said I was right about everything.
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:07.000]  And, of course, what happens?
[1:27:07.000 --> 1:27:08.000]  Does Newsweek write a correction?
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:10.000]  Does The Washington Post write a correction?
[1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:11.000]  Does The New York Times?
[1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:12.000]  No.
[1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:14.000]  Oh, BuzzFeed asked me for a comment on their article they already wrote.
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:15.000]  Those cat pornographers?
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:16.000]  I hate those people.
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:17.000]  Yeah.
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:20.000]  They asked me for a comment about Kelly banning us.
[1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:23.000]  And I went, dude, give Paschalbic and Got News credit.
[1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:25.000]  They reported it three weeks ago.
[1:27:25.000 --> 1:27:26.000]  Nothing.
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:29.000]  I put up on Facebook that Ben was going to leave the White House 10 days before everybody else.
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:31.000]  You know, maybe I know the guy.
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:32.000]  Maybe I used to work for him.
[1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:33.000]  Oh, wait, I did.
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:35.000]  So, like, yeah, these people don't have any sources anymore.
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:36.000]  And so they're trying.
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:37.000]  Because they're lazy.
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:42.000]  They just wait for literal, you know, I found out, I'm sure you know, it's still Podesta
[1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:46.000]  talking points for most the media and David Brock.
[1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:49.000]  And so they just write this stuff and then everyone regurgitates it.
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:50.000]  Yes.
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:54.000]  There's this whole underground opposition research layer of which I was once, you know,
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:55.000]  once apart.
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:27:58.000]  And there's this whole, like, public affairs, all the scheming that takes place.
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:02.000]  And really very little of the journalism you actually read in mainstream media is actually
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:03.000]  written by the reporters themselves.
[1:28:03.000 --> 1:28:05.000]  I mean, if Trump did something bad, I would just report it.
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:06.000]  Hell yeah.
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:07.000]  That's why they hate us.
[1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  It's why they hate him.
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:09.000]  He's actually the president.
[1:28:09.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  Well, I gotta tell you.
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:11.000]  He's accountable.
[1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:13.000]  He's accountable in a way that no other president has been.
[1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  Think about this.
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:16.500]  You can tweet to the president of the United States right now if you're not banned from
[1:28:16.500 --> 1:28:17.620]  Twitter like I am.
[1:28:17.620 --> 1:28:20.240]  You can tweet to him that he's a loser, right?
[1:28:20.240 --> 1:28:21.800]  And he's a jerk or whatever.
[1:28:21.800 --> 1:28:24.440]  And there's a probability that he might actually read that.
[1:28:24.440 --> 1:28:25.600]  Think about the level of influence.
[1:28:25.600 --> 1:28:29.600]  And he cares about you and craves what you're doing.
[1:28:29.600 --> 1:28:36.280]  Most elitists are like, those people, yeah, Obama, oh, well, with Trump, he's a guy looking
[1:28:36.280 --> 1:28:37.280]  at you.
[1:28:37.280 --> 1:28:38.280]  That's right.
[1:28:38.280 --> 1:28:39.280]  That's right.
[1:28:39.280 --> 1:28:43.240]  Because he knows the wisdom of the crowd, because his dad taught him that.
[1:28:43.240 --> 1:28:47.440]  How do you think you muscled in all that stuff going on in New York in construction by listening
[1:28:47.440 --> 1:28:50.880]  to the little guys and Trump knows about crowd wisdom?
[1:28:50.880 --> 1:28:53.360]  We'll be back with Roger Stone and our guest.
[1:28:53.360 --> 1:28:54.360]  Stay with us.
[1:28:54.360 --> 1:28:56.880]  Not a group you develop living defense for us.
[1:28:56.880 --> 1:28:58.280]  It took you over a year to do it.
[1:28:58.280 --> 1:29:00.000]  Why is this so good?
[1:29:00.000 --> 1:29:04.720]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[1:29:04.720 --> 1:29:09.320]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[1:29:09.320 --> 1:29:10.320]  my system.
[1:29:10.320 --> 1:29:15.560]  But right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful
[1:29:15.560 --> 1:29:20.840]  to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading
[1:29:20.840 --> 1:29:22.100]  disease around.
[1:29:22.100 --> 1:29:24.720]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[1:29:24.720 --> 1:29:25.720]  These are all parasites.
[1:29:25.720 --> 1:29:28.440]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[1:29:28.440 --> 1:29:29.680]  You have the neem in there.
[1:29:29.680 --> 1:29:32.760]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[1:29:32.760 --> 1:29:36.040]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[1:29:36.040 --> 1:29:37.040]  All right.
[1:29:37.040 --> 1:29:39.240]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[1:29:39.240 --> 1:29:40.400]  It just came back in yesterday.

[1:31:09.200 --> 1:31:13.800]  That's why the Last Surgeon Generals report on oral health warns that your oral health
[1:31:13.800 --> 1:31:16.520]  can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[1:31:16.520 --> 1:31:21.040]  Super blue fluoride-free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula that's loaded with good halogen
[1:31:21.040 --> 1:31:23.640]  iodide, some of the bad halogen fluoride.
[1:31:23.640 --> 1:31:28.200]  Super blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out
[1:31:28.200 --> 1:31:30.720]  bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[1:31:30.720 --> 1:31:35.360]  Just some of the ingredients in super blue, chosen by our dental experts include xylitol,
[1:31:35.360 --> 1:31:38.320]  peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver, and more.
[1:31:38.320 --> 1:31:42.160]  Due to requests from listeners who found that spearmint was a little bit too strong for some
[1:31:42.160 --> 1:31:46.720]  of their children, we have created the new bubblegum flavored super blue that is spearmint-free.
[1:31:46.720 --> 1:31:51.000]  Learn more about the new bubblegum flavored super blue toothpaste and more at infowarslife.com.

[1:31:55.480 --> 1:32:01.920]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still
[1:32:01.920 --> 1:32:04.920]  maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[1:32:04.920 --> 1:32:05.920]  That's right.

[1:32:21.600 --> 1:32:24.280]  dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[1:32:24.280 --> 1:32:26.160]  Woo, that's what I'm talking about.
[1:32:26.160 --> 1:32:31.120]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating,
[1:32:31.120 --> 1:32:35.120]  you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[1:32:35.120 --> 1:32:40.960]  Harvest Rights Freeze Dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value

[1:32:44.440 --> 1:32:47.880]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[1:32:47.880 --> 1:32:52.040]  Harvest Rights is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[1:32:52.040 --> 1:32:53.040]  So what are you waiting for?
[1:32:53.040 --> 1:32:58.760]  Check it out right now at infowarsstore.com.
[1:32:58.760 --> 1:33:16.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:33:16.160 --> 1:33:21.920]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[1:33:21.920 --> 1:33:24.760]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[1:33:24.760 --> 1:33:31.400]  Well, what's crazy is Roger Stone popping in with us for one segment and the other guys
[1:33:31.400 --> 1:33:32.400]  is coming back.
[1:33:32.400 --> 1:33:37.280]  He has his birthday today, which is LBJ's birthday.
[1:33:37.280 --> 1:33:40.800]  If you go to his Twitter, you can see an image of that.
[1:33:40.800 --> 1:33:41.800]  We're both of them.
[1:33:41.800 --> 1:33:45.400]  We're having their birthday right now, so we'll pull that up.
[1:33:45.400 --> 1:33:49.600]  Of course, StoneColdTruth.com is his website.
[1:33:49.600 --> 1:33:51.880]  It's his birthday, so he's got to go.
[1:33:51.880 --> 1:33:56.760]  He's all in his Texas duds right now, but I just wanted to get his take on, is Trump
[1:33:56.760 --> 1:34:02.320]  selling us out like Gorkin and desert descent Bannon is saying?
[1:34:02.320 --> 1:34:04.840]  And he basically, this morning, concurred with what I was told.
[1:34:04.840 --> 1:34:05.840]  He's still Americana.
[1:34:05.840 --> 1:34:09.320]  Still trying to turn the economy on, but he is listening to the generals, so it's more
[1:34:09.320 --> 1:34:11.840]  of a neocon bent war-wise.
[1:34:11.840 --> 1:34:17.600]  I mean, he did defeat ISIS pretty much and with our military.
[1:34:17.600 --> 1:34:19.760]  So some good things are happening.
[1:34:19.760 --> 1:34:23.360]  It's just that overall, we're going to be honest with you, the president's not perfect.
[1:34:23.360 --> 1:34:27.880]  But as Rand Paul said, thank God every morning, Hillary Clinton's not president.
[1:34:27.880 --> 1:34:30.360]  So really, let's burrow down into this.
[1:34:30.360 --> 1:34:32.240]  Where are we currently right now with this?
[1:34:32.240 --> 1:34:37.880]  And then some of the good news, lawsuits against the SPLC, one of the most disreputable groups
[1:34:37.880 --> 1:34:44.360]  out there now running Google, running Facebook, running Twitter, running banking systems.
[1:34:44.360 --> 1:34:50.600]  I mean, in 1935, Germany, if the Nazis said your business was shut down and happened, literally
[1:34:50.600 --> 1:34:51.800]  they're calling us Nazis.
[1:34:51.800 --> 1:34:53.000]  This is Nazi tactics.
[1:34:53.000 --> 1:34:55.440]  So Roger stood on your birthday.
[1:34:55.440 --> 1:34:59.000]  Good to have you here with us.
[1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:03.440]  You know, my New York Times bestselling book, The Man Who Killed Kennedy, The Case Against
[1:35:03.440 --> 1:35:11.720]  LBJ, I think finally sets the record straight on the 36th president who was a serial murderer
[1:35:11.720 --> 1:35:13.720]  and a lunatic.
[1:35:13.720 --> 1:35:19.280]  And therefore, it's somehow ironic that he and I share a birthday August 27th.
[1:35:19.280 --> 1:35:20.760]  Great to be with you.
[1:35:20.760 --> 1:35:26.440]  On the president, I think what's happening here in all honesty based on my conversations
[1:35:26.440 --> 1:35:33.320]  within the administration is on domestic policy, particularly on immigration, still on trade,
[1:35:33.320 --> 1:35:39.280]  on a growing war party to go to war for his tax reform package, which I think is the key
[1:35:39.280 --> 1:35:40.920]  to his presidency.
[1:35:40.920 --> 1:35:46.320]  The president remains solid, where I do see some erosion.
[1:35:46.320 --> 1:35:52.240]  And this is his decision not to send 150,000 troops to Syria, not withstanding.
[1:35:52.240 --> 1:36:01.200]  And this minor but troubling incursion into Afghanistan, we assume 4,000 troops, although
[1:36:01.200 --> 1:36:02.840]  that's not really clear.
[1:36:02.840 --> 1:36:08.280]  The president told us little about their plan, not wanting to telegraph to the enemy exactly
[1:36:08.280 --> 1:36:09.600]  what we're doing.
[1:36:09.600 --> 1:36:12.840]  Thinking that he's been consistent about Alex for 40 years.
[1:36:12.840 --> 1:36:17.360]  I do see the generals trying to move him towards a neocon bent.
[1:36:17.360 --> 1:36:23.280]  I think that he's being undermined by the secretary of state Rex Tillerson, who was
[1:36:23.280 --> 1:36:28.720]  really not happy with the job, essentially detached, and therefore letting Condoleezza
[1:36:28.720 --> 1:36:36.080]  Rice and her many hand-picked hires there run the U.S. Department of State.
[1:36:36.080 --> 1:36:37.080]  Wow.
[1:36:37.080 --> 1:36:44.000]  So, I still give, I want to be very clear, I'm with the president till the better end,
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:51.560]  because on the major issues, Glass, Stiegel, immigration, the wall, TPP, carbon taxes,
[1:36:51.560 --> 1:36:56.240]  the stock market, jobs back to America, renegotiate, have them go.
[1:36:56.240 --> 1:36:57.240]  Climate change.
[1:36:57.240 --> 1:37:01.120]  I mean, look, on the big picture issues, he's been very strong despite it completely.
[1:37:01.120 --> 1:37:05.040]  But there is a real infatuation with these generals.
[1:37:05.040 --> 1:37:08.960]  Kelly, Trump ordered new policy, the border patrol did it.
[1:37:08.960 --> 1:37:16.600]  He's promoted Kelly because he delivered on 69% reduction in massive deportation of criminals
[1:37:16.600 --> 1:37:17.600]  that had committed crimes.
[1:37:17.600 --> 1:37:19.560]  But that's Trump's policies.
[1:37:19.560 --> 1:37:20.960]  Trump needs to take a victory lap.
[1:37:20.960 --> 1:37:26.040]  I get the fact that Kelly over Homeland Security executed it, but can't Trump pat himself in
[1:37:26.040 --> 1:37:27.040]  the back?
[1:37:27.040 --> 1:37:28.960]  Well, in fact, you're absolutely right, Alex.
[1:37:28.960 --> 1:37:32.080]  All we started to do was to enforce the law.
[1:37:32.080 --> 1:37:35.040]  Now we learned today that if you apply to the United States, you're going to have a
[1:37:35.040 --> 1:37:40.280]  personal eye-to-eye interview with some American who looks at you and tries to figure out why
[1:37:40.280 --> 1:37:43.240]  you want to come here based on everything you've submitted.
[1:37:43.240 --> 1:37:45.920]  That's the way it should be.
[1:37:45.920 --> 1:37:51.080]  As the president said, we would freeze immigration until such timely, we set up a system that
[1:37:51.080 --> 1:37:58.640]  allowed us to find out what the hell was going on, completely reasonable.
[1:37:58.640 --> 1:37:59.640]  Where is the American Republic?
[1:37:59.640 --> 1:38:03.160]  Because I see us at Helter Skelter, they're trying to kill the president, they're promoting,
[1:38:03.160 --> 1:38:07.840]  they're going to kill him on CNN with former deputy directors of the CIA.
[1:38:07.840 --> 1:38:11.480]  They're trying to see everybody that's in opposition is a Nazi, ban us off the internet.
[1:38:11.480 --> 1:38:14.640]  It's an incredible time to be alive, Roger.
[1:38:14.640 --> 1:38:21.280]  And with the backdrop then of the president just sitting there, sitting there taking it.
[1:38:21.280 --> 1:38:23.360]  I mean, what does he do?
[1:38:23.360 --> 1:38:24.360]  What do we do?
[1:38:24.360 --> 1:38:27.840]  Because it's just so historical, it's so perilous.
[1:38:27.840 --> 1:38:29.400]  What's happening right now?
[1:38:29.400 --> 1:38:35.400]  I have now independently confirmed a story reported by Paul Joseph Watson here at InfoWars
[1:38:35.400 --> 1:38:43.720]  that General McMaster is bedeviled by our broadcasts and stories on InfoWars and that
[1:38:43.720 --> 1:38:50.480]  he is going out of his way to try to not only bring an iron curtain down around the president
[1:38:50.480 --> 1:38:56.320]  in terms of communications, but specifically to cut InfoWars off.
[1:38:56.320 --> 1:39:01.280]  Right? Because we are the tip of the spear because we are hitting him with the stone
[1:39:01.280 --> 1:39:09.640]  cold truth, as it were, about McMaster, about Kelly and what he's really up to, about Dina
[1:39:09.640 --> 1:39:17.640]  Habib Powell, who is a fellow traveler of the Neocons, a former Bush aide, a former
[1:39:17.640 --> 1:39:21.080]  member of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[1:39:21.080 --> 1:39:29.720]  So we have, we've exposed Fiona Hill, McMaster's top deputy, an actual Soros agent who worked
[1:39:29.720 --> 1:39:36.960]  at the Global Society Initiative, Harvard, Council on Foreign Relations, and it does
[1:39:36.960 --> 1:39:39.080]  another lefty connections.
[1:39:39.080 --> 1:39:42.280]  Why are these people in the Trump White House?
[1:39:42.280 --> 1:39:47.960]  That's why I say the danger is not in domestic policy, the danger is here, and there's a
[1:39:47.960 --> 1:39:52.920]  fight to be fought, but the president, to his credit, while he went for the Afghanistan
[1:39:52.920 --> 1:39:59.400]  bait, he did not go for their Syria charade.
[1:39:59.400 --> 1:40:00.400]  Other points.
[1:40:00.400 --> 1:40:02.800]  I mean, where is Trump seven months in?
[1:40:02.800 --> 1:40:10.120]  I mean, they're, they're, they're just fully, well, trying to push his overthrow and just
[1:40:10.120 --> 1:40:15.960]  wildly running around censoring everybody into a complete hysteria.
[1:40:15.960 --> 1:40:16.960]  Where does this go?
[1:40:16.960 --> 1:40:20.000]  Yeah, you've got two things going on here at once, I think, Alex.
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:26.160]  You have the left who are ratcheting up now racial tensions because the Russian gambit
[1:40:26.160 --> 1:40:32.960]  has failed, and this is kind of a proven trick for them.
[1:40:32.960 --> 1:40:38.960]  The networks and CNN certainly jump on to forward their narrative that the biggest problem
[1:40:38.960 --> 1:40:44.760]  in the country today are neo-Nazi white supremacists and Klansmen, who, while I admit there may
[1:40:44.760 --> 1:40:48.480]  be a handful of these nuts, is not the great danger in the country.
[1:40:48.480 --> 1:40:53.720]  The great danger is those on the left who are assaulting people, beating people, tearing
[1:40:53.720 --> 1:41:01.520]  down stations, statues, and monuments, defaming public property, looting, burning.
[1:41:01.520 --> 1:41:06.840]  That is the danger, and the mainstream media, while they give it some coverage, they give
[1:41:06.840 --> 1:41:12.720]  a disproportionate amount of coverage to a white supremacist in Charlottesville who turns
[1:41:12.720 --> 1:41:20.200]  out after you peel back the onion to have worked for Obama just several years ago.
[1:41:20.200 --> 1:41:25.360]  At the same time, you've got General Kelly, who really understands that, as I have said
[1:41:25.360 --> 1:41:30.280]  a million times on this program, when Donald Trump has all the information, he is a gut
[1:41:30.280 --> 1:41:31.280]  anti-interventionist.
[1:41:31.280 --> 1:41:33.720]  He is a gut standup for America.
[1:41:33.720 --> 1:41:37.720]  And so they want to try to hijack the country, an informational coup, and closing in the
[1:41:37.720 --> 1:41:40.120]  one minute we have on your birthday, StoneCulture.com.
[1:41:40.120 --> 1:41:45.120]  Thanks for joining us, Herr Rodger.
[1:41:45.120 --> 1:41:49.480]  What do we do to continue to make sure we get real information to Trump?
[1:41:49.480 --> 1:41:53.120]  Because that shows how real he is that they're trying to block that off.
[1:41:53.120 --> 1:41:55.120]  Well, this is a very key thing, Alex.
[1:41:55.120 --> 1:42:02.000]  I can tell you, despite the very best efforts of General Kelly, that the president is seeing,
[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:07.160]  not all, but some seminal and important info wars reports.
[1:42:07.160 --> 1:42:11.840]  You see, they don't understand that the president is his own man, and he does not want to be
[1:42:11.840 --> 1:42:16.840]  treated like a mushroom, in other words, kept in the dark and fed shit.
[1:42:16.840 --> 1:42:21.920]  He wants to know the facts, and he's naturally inquisitive, and there are channels, and there
[1:42:21.920 --> 1:42:27.080]  will always be channels, that are perfectly legal, but are perhaps unknown to General
[1:42:27.080 --> 1:42:29.320]  Kelly, to get him information.
[1:42:29.320 --> 1:42:31.800]  So the good news is, the president is getting some-
[1:42:31.800 --> 1:42:36.800]  And they've shown their hand how desperate they are to keep him in the dark and to stop
[1:42:36.800 --> 1:42:38.840]  us from getting leaks and info.
[1:42:38.840 --> 1:42:42.160]  So they're admitting we're real, they're admitting we have access.
[1:42:42.160 --> 1:42:45.880]  This is a big victory, and they're admitting that he actually stands for what he believes
[1:42:45.880 --> 1:42:50.320]  in and actually listens to information, not special interests and lobbyists.
[1:42:50.320 --> 1:42:51.320]  Happy birthday, Roger Stone.
[1:42:51.320 --> 1:42:52.320]  Let's talk tomorrow.
[1:42:52.320 --> 1:42:54.840]  I know you're going on vacation, but we appreciate you.
[1:42:54.840 --> 1:42:57.080]  Joe Vicks here with infowars.com.
[1:42:57.080 --> 1:42:59.320]  Today I want to talk to you about guns.
[1:42:59.320 --> 1:43:00.400]  Why we have them.
[1:43:00.400 --> 1:43:03.760]  Why the Bill of Rights guarantees that we can have them.
[1:43:03.760 --> 1:43:08.880]  And why my right to have a gun is more important than your right to rail against it in the
[1:43:08.880 --> 1:43:09.880]  press.
[1:43:09.880 --> 1:43:13.840]  I believe every good journalist needs to know why the Second Amendment must be considered
[1:43:13.840 --> 1:43:16.440]  more essential than the First Amendment.
[1:43:16.440 --> 1:43:21.360]  This may be a bitter pill to swallow, but the right to keep and bear arms is not an
[1:43:21.360 --> 1:43:26.680]  outdated, dusty idea some old dead white guys dreamed up in fear of the Redcoats.
[1:43:26.680 --> 1:43:32.600]  No, it is just as essential to liberty today as it was in 1776.
[1:43:32.600 --> 1:43:37.000]  The original amendments we refer to as the Bill of Rights contain ten of what the constitutional
[1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:39.760]  framers termed unalienable rights.
[1:43:39.760 --> 1:43:42.400]  The Bill of Rights came to us with blinders on.
[1:43:42.400 --> 1:43:45.240]  It doesn't recognize color or class or wealth.
[1:43:45.240 --> 1:43:50.400]  It protects not just the rights of actors or editors or reporters, but extends even to
[1:43:50.400 --> 1:43:51.960]  those we love to hate.
[1:43:51.960 --> 1:44:18.960]  This is a small excerpt from Tralton Heston.

[1:45:00.280 --> 1:45:03.160]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[1:45:03.160 --> 1:45:09.200]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[1:45:09.200 --> 1:45:14.160]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure Groundbreaking

[1:45:31.000 --> 1:45:34.000]  or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[1:45:34.000 --> 1:45:36.200]  The general public doesn't.
[1:45:36.200 --> 1:45:40.160]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.

[1:45:43.760 --> 1:45:47.320]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more
[1:45:47.320 --> 1:45:50.520]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[1:45:50.520 --> 1:45:54.600]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at infowarstore.com.

[1:46:10.440 --> 1:46:11.440]  very, very soon.
[1:46:11.440 --> 1:46:15.360]  When it comes to a formula that is such a game-changer like DNA Force, we never know
[1:46:15.360 --> 1:46:19.040]  when we will be able to secure an additional supply of the key ingredients.
[1:46:19.040 --> 1:46:24.200]  The secret behind DNA Force is its powerful lineup of patented ingredients like CoQ-10,
[1:46:24.200 --> 1:46:28.640]  systematic enzymes, NAR-lipolic acid, BioPQQ, and many others.
[1:46:28.640 --> 1:46:34.240]  BioPQQ alone is backed by an unprecedented 175 clinical studies, and just one batch of
[1:46:34.240 --> 1:46:37.200]  this stuff costs us more than $30,000.

[1:46:54.440 --> 1:47:00.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:47:00.440 --> 1:47:16.440]  They took my saddle in Houston, broke my leg in the Santa Fe, lost my wife and a girlfriend
[1:47:16.440 --> 1:47:20.440]  somewhere along the way.
[1:47:20.440 --> 1:47:23.440]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[1:47:23.440 --> 1:47:34.040]  All right, we'll be taking more calls tomorrow.
[1:47:34.040 --> 1:47:40.840]  Lord willing, I'll get eight when they pull that gate to quote the great George Strafe
[1:47:40.840 --> 1:47:43.840]  from out here in Texas with the horrible Hurricane Harvey.
[1:47:43.840 --> 1:47:44.960]  We'll know more tomorrow.
[1:47:44.960 --> 1:47:48.480]  Obviously, there's always a lot more dead than they say because they don't find the
[1:47:48.480 --> 1:47:52.440]  body so later, but like the police and sheriff's department said, if you're going to go open
[1:47:52.440 --> 1:47:58.840]  your attic, have a hatchet or have an axe because you may basically have to hack your
[1:47:58.840 --> 1:48:03.720]  way out the roof when the water goes up even more, so pray for folks down there in Houston
[1:48:03.720 --> 1:48:04.720]  right now.
[1:48:04.720 --> 1:48:10.080]  A lot of articles and videos up on infowors.com, no, they're fighting hard to block these articles
[1:48:10.080 --> 1:48:11.360]  to block these videos.
[1:48:11.360 --> 1:48:13.240]  They're fighting hard to shut down our local affiliates.
[1:48:13.240 --> 1:48:17.120]  So if you'll just spread the word, pray for us and also check out the different sales
[1:48:17.120 --> 1:48:19.000]  we have at infoworstore.com.
[1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:20.320]  That makes it all possible.
[1:48:20.320 --> 1:48:27.200]  Now, Chuck Johnson, talk about destiny, talk about serendipity, synchronicity, I don't
[1:48:27.200 --> 1:48:28.360]  know what the term is.
[1:48:28.360 --> 1:48:33.480]  I called up one of the producers yesterday, called up Daria, because Alia has been the
[1:48:33.480 --> 1:48:38.920]  main producer right now because the normal head producer, Nico's on vacation, he's the
[1:48:38.920 --> 1:48:40.640]  second producer, which does a great job.
[1:48:40.640 --> 1:48:42.680]  I just thought, well, I'll just be nice and call Daria.
[1:48:42.680 --> 1:48:46.120]  And I said, hey, this Chuck Johnson guy, he's a good article, good stuff, people say good
[1:48:46.120 --> 1:48:47.120]  things about him.
[1:48:47.120 --> 1:48:49.760]  I noticed they say Melania Trump gives the stuff to the president and they want to stop
[1:48:49.760 --> 1:48:50.760]  that.
[1:48:50.760 --> 1:48:51.760]  And he's defending us.
[1:48:51.760 --> 1:48:53.640]  It'd be great, you know, to have him on.
[1:48:53.640 --> 1:48:54.640]  She goes, well, let me see.
[1:48:54.640 --> 1:48:55.640]  How about next week?
[1:48:55.640 --> 1:48:56.640]  I said, yeah, whenever.
[1:48:56.640 --> 1:48:58.760]  She goes, oh my gosh, we just called her place.
[1:48:58.760 --> 1:49:03.360]  He's in Austin just randomly for another meeting.
[1:49:03.360 --> 1:49:04.600]  I don't know how many times you've been here.
[1:49:04.600 --> 1:49:06.200]  It's like third time ever.
[1:49:06.200 --> 1:49:09.960]  So it was like, boom, had him in and just I really click with what you're saying.
[1:49:09.960 --> 1:49:11.360]  It's all on target for me.
[1:49:11.360 --> 1:49:13.120]  So I'm the nine minutes we have left.
[1:49:13.120 --> 1:49:15.520]  What else do you want to impart to folks about the world?
[1:49:15.520 --> 1:49:18.320]  I meant to get into all this and the fact that I may suit Tom Brokaw.
[1:49:18.320 --> 1:49:19.880]  I don't want to.
[1:49:19.880 --> 1:49:20.880]  I'm not just threatening.
[1:49:20.880 --> 1:49:21.880]  I mean, I have to.
[1:49:21.880 --> 1:49:22.880]  They're like, he's KKK.
[1:49:22.880 --> 1:49:27.560]  He's a Nazi and I'm being shut down in business everywhere and blocked from trying to even
[1:49:27.560 --> 1:49:28.560]  advertise.
[1:49:28.560 --> 1:49:32.280]  And it's like, listen, dude, you got to do it and I'll help you crowdfund from your folks
[1:49:32.280 --> 1:49:33.280]  to sue them.
[1:49:33.280 --> 1:49:35.640]  Because I mean, I fought back on the Gawker situation.
[1:49:35.640 --> 1:49:39.640]  Look, otherwise, they just they put you in this Lexis Nexus Google prison where your
[1:49:39.640 --> 1:49:40.640]  reputation gets.
[1:49:40.640 --> 1:49:42.400]  Yeah, I mean, like next they'll say, I'm a child molester.
[1:49:42.400 --> 1:49:43.400]  I mean, for sure.
[1:49:43.400 --> 1:49:46.000]  They said that about Assange and Assange wants to sue CNN.
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:47.000]  That's what you do.
[1:49:47.000 --> 1:49:48.560]  That's the hot shit.
[1:49:48.560 --> 1:49:50.160]  This is like this is what they do.
[1:49:50.160 --> 1:49:54.040]  It's a former trying to enslave us and we got to fight and intimidate us and intimidate
[1:49:54.040 --> 1:49:55.040]  us.
[1:49:55.040 --> 1:49:56.240]  And you know, and they have, I'm going to sue them now.
[1:49:56.240 --> 1:49:57.240]  Get ready.
[1:49:57.240 --> 1:50:02.200]  Look, we I trust that the American public, I trust my fate to a jury of my peers.
[1:50:02.200 --> 1:50:04.080]  My flight is fight any time.
[1:50:04.080 --> 1:50:05.080]  My flight is fight.
[1:50:05.080 --> 1:50:06.080]  Sorry.
[1:50:06.080 --> 1:50:07.080]  Go ahead.
[1:50:07.080 --> 1:50:08.080]  Yeah.
[1:50:08.080 --> 1:50:09.800]  I mean, my my attitude here is, you know, you got to trust your trust, trust the American
[1:50:09.800 --> 1:50:10.800]  people and they'll protect us.
[1:50:10.800 --> 1:50:13.520]  I mean, look at what what Hulk Hogan did to Gawker.
[1:50:13.520 --> 1:50:14.520]  Like we can fight.
[1:50:14.520 --> 1:50:17.960]  Listen, I'm protesting the Klan 15 times on video.
[1:50:17.960 --> 1:50:22.200]  I'm playing Martin Luther King's speeches 20 years ago and this and they're saying I'm
[1:50:22.200 --> 1:50:24.920]  the most racist man in America with no clips.
[1:50:24.920 --> 1:50:25.920]  Nope.
[1:50:25.920 --> 1:50:29.360]  And then losing millions of dollars of funding.
[1:50:29.360 --> 1:50:30.520]  It's all McCarthyite, man.
[1:50:30.520 --> 1:50:31.520]  They just make up the stuff.
[1:50:31.520 --> 1:50:32.520]  They take.
[1:50:32.520 --> 1:50:33.520]  I mean, we have them.
[1:50:33.520 --> 1:50:35.440]  We have them saying we want to destroy Alex Jones.
[1:50:35.440 --> 1:50:37.480]  Well, that's the statute to win.
[1:50:37.480 --> 1:50:38.880]  Well, they want to destroy me too.
[1:50:38.880 --> 1:50:40.920]  So you know, let's hang together or hang separately.
[1:50:40.920 --> 1:50:42.760]  I mean, this is, you know, we can win.
[1:50:42.760 --> 1:50:46.880]  Yeah, there's your article right there, Gawker and Hulk Hogan reached $31 million settlement.
[1:50:46.880 --> 1:50:47.880]  Yep.
[1:50:47.880 --> 1:50:49.160]  So, you know, we're going to keep fighting these people.
[1:50:49.160 --> 1:50:50.160]  And you're in that article.
[1:50:50.160 --> 1:50:51.600]  You were in the Wall Street Journal last week.
[1:50:51.600 --> 1:50:52.600]  Tell folks about that.
[1:50:52.600 --> 1:50:53.600]  Yeah.
[1:50:53.600 --> 1:50:54.600]  I was in the journal.
[1:50:54.600 --> 1:50:58.320]  You know, basically we're fighting over 1.5 million bucks within the estate, taking the
[1:50:58.320 --> 1:51:01.800]  money from Univision and from Gawker because Univision bought Gawker.
[1:51:01.800 --> 1:51:03.160]  And we're going to keep fighting these people.
[1:51:03.160 --> 1:51:07.960]  Look, I, I know that there are people out there who want the truth and they want the
[1:51:07.960 --> 1:51:10.480]  media right now is trying to reassert a cartel.
[1:51:10.480 --> 1:51:14.400]  They're trying to crush people and they're trying to lie and to basically malign people.
[1:51:14.400 --> 1:51:17.600]  I mean, when I was in college, I saved somebody's life.
[1:51:17.600 --> 1:51:21.320]  And what they did was they claimed all this false stuff about me from, from college, from
[1:51:21.320 --> 1:51:25.800]  me, anonymous blog posts on an article or anonymous comments and that, that became the
[1:51:25.800 --> 1:51:26.800]  source of their story.
[1:51:26.800 --> 1:51:27.800]  Oh, they do that to me.
[1:51:27.800 --> 1:51:31.880]  Like they've had all articles going, someone knew him in Austin once and he did this.
[1:51:31.880 --> 1:51:34.120]  And it's like, and this is smearing that takes place.
[1:51:34.120 --> 1:51:35.960]  Now, I trust the American people.
[1:51:35.960 --> 1:51:38.800]  I trust, you know, there's goodness in this country.
[1:51:38.800 --> 1:51:39.800]  And so yes, absolutely.
[1:51:39.800 --> 1:51:42.640]  And we should, we should build a litigation financing fund.
[1:51:42.640 --> 1:51:43.640]  You can do that in Texas.
[1:51:43.640 --> 1:51:44.640]  You're a Texan.
[1:51:44.640 --> 1:51:46.320]  So you're totally within your rights to do that.
[1:51:46.320 --> 1:51:50.280]  And people could even get a return for the settlements that they end up getting, that
[1:51:50.280 --> 1:51:51.280]  you end up getting again.
[1:51:51.280 --> 1:51:52.280]  I just don't have to.
[1:51:52.280 --> 1:51:54.400]  They say, we're going to destroy Alex Jones.
[1:51:54.400 --> 1:51:55.400]  We're blocking his.
[1:51:55.400 --> 1:51:56.400]  There's your malice right there.
[1:51:56.400 --> 1:51:57.400]  I mean, for goodness sakes.
[1:51:57.400 --> 1:51:58.400]  Right.
[1:51:58.400 --> 1:52:00.600]  I mean, I, I have to now.
[1:52:00.600 --> 1:52:01.600]  Yeah.
[1:52:01.600 --> 1:52:02.600]  No choice.
[1:52:02.600 --> 1:52:05.200]  Now we need to find patriotic lawyers who will help us in this cause.
[1:52:05.200 --> 1:52:08.960]  And unfortunately, I've been helped out in the past and raised, raised some money.
[1:52:08.960 --> 1:52:09.960]  People help me out with that.
[1:52:09.960 --> 1:52:13.480]  Cause my final search is to give you my word for the right lawyers and the right jurisdiction
[1:52:13.480 --> 1:52:14.480]  to sue in.
[1:52:14.480 --> 1:52:15.480]  Yeah.
[1:52:15.480 --> 1:52:17.200]  I'm in like, where should I sue Tom Brokaw?
[1:52:17.200 --> 1:52:20.800]  Like, like what jurisdiction does he have a place in South Dakota?
[1:52:20.800 --> 1:52:21.800]  Yeah.
[1:52:21.800 --> 1:52:24.480]  I would bet that the good people of South Dakota like you a lot more than him.
[1:52:24.480 --> 1:52:26.560]  Just a, just a bet.
[1:52:26.560 --> 1:52:29.440]  And I would bet that if you got into a courtroom in South Dakota and I think they have pretty
[1:52:29.440 --> 1:52:30.440]  good damages there.
[1:52:30.440 --> 1:52:33.320]  So yeah, you should absolutely go against him.
[1:52:33.320 --> 1:52:36.440]  And this kind of thing is just like, it's pretty shameful what he's been able to do
[1:52:36.440 --> 1:52:37.520]  over these years.
[1:52:37.520 --> 1:52:41.440]  They try to see what they want is they want, he launched the fake Iraq war, fake Iraq war.
[1:52:41.440 --> 1:52:44.200]  So people should be tortured to death.
[1:52:44.200 --> 1:52:46.880]  All the news that's fit to print, all this fraud that's immediate as they're trying to
[1:52:46.880 --> 1:52:49.760]  keep their cartel because they're afraid of us getting around them.
[1:52:49.760 --> 1:52:52.000]  And this is what the Kelly thing is about.
[1:52:52.000 --> 1:52:58.200]  Look, they, they, John Kelly couldn't beat a bunch of savages in Iraq, a bunch of insurgents
[1:52:58.200 --> 1:52:59.200]  in Iraq.
[1:52:59.200 --> 1:53:01.560]  He's, but we weren't, we were saying, let's see if the generals are good.
[1:53:01.560 --> 1:53:02.560]  Let's give them a chance.
[1:53:02.560 --> 1:53:04.040]  They immediately start attacking us.
[1:53:04.040 --> 1:53:05.040]  Yeah.
[1:53:05.040 --> 1:53:07.480]  And they immediately start restricting information just like they did in Iraq, just like all
[1:53:07.480 --> 1:53:08.920]  the games they played there.
[1:53:08.920 --> 1:53:14.280]  And right now they're up against a young, four-chan generation of people like 20, 30, and-
[1:53:14.280 --> 1:53:17.320]  Yeah, not to be mean, but they're not up against the poor starving Iraqis.
[1:53:17.320 --> 1:53:20.520]  No, they're up against really smart people who want the truth out there and then we're
[1:53:20.520 --> 1:53:21.520]  willing to fight for them.
[1:53:21.520 --> 1:53:23.000]  I mean, we grew up on the internet.
[1:53:23.000 --> 1:53:26.720]  And if these guys think they're going to defeat the autistic power of four-chan-
[1:53:26.720 --> 1:53:28.240]  They got another thing coming.
[1:53:28.240 --> 1:53:29.240]  They got another thing coming.
[1:53:29.240 --> 1:53:31.200]  I mean, my, you know, my memes are dank.
[1:53:31.200 --> 1:53:32.760]  I mean, we're going to keep fighting.
[1:53:32.760 --> 1:53:33.880]  And I think they don't get this.
[1:53:33.880 --> 1:53:39.040]  They don't understand that the way to help Trump is to empower Trump, not to restrict
[1:53:39.040 --> 1:53:40.040]  him.
[1:53:40.040 --> 1:53:43.640]  This is a giant of a man, and he's 71 years old, you're not going to keep him off the
[1:53:43.640 --> 1:53:44.640]  internet.
[1:53:44.640 --> 1:53:47.480]  You're going to remember they try to do this, stop tweeting, Mr. President, stop tweeting.
[1:53:47.480 --> 1:53:51.200]  And then he started just tweeting out pardons, tweeting out things he was reversing.
[1:53:51.200 --> 1:53:53.640]  I mean, this is how it should be done.
[1:53:53.640 --> 1:53:55.000]  Forget your communication shop.
[1:53:55.000 --> 1:53:56.000]  Fire those people.
[1:53:56.000 --> 1:54:00.440]  And they're so pissed that it was my article, of course, his article on Drudge Report that
[1:54:00.440 --> 1:54:02.280]  the President saw and then did the pardon.
[1:54:02.280 --> 1:54:05.520]  I mean, of course, he did nothing, but did his job, of course, pardoning.
[1:54:05.520 --> 1:54:06.520]  He should pardon.
[1:54:06.520 --> 1:54:08.640]  He didn't pardon Coke dealers like the Clintons did.
[1:54:08.640 --> 1:54:11.440]  Yeah, or crack dealers like Trump, like Obama did.
[1:54:11.440 --> 1:54:17.400]  I mean, look, Trump needs to start using the power of the presidency in a dignified, real
[1:54:17.400 --> 1:54:18.400]  man.
[1:54:18.400 --> 1:54:19.400]  And he's finally doing it.
[1:54:19.400 --> 1:54:21.680]  And he should pardon Assange 100% if he does.
[1:54:21.680 --> 1:54:23.400]  Oh, and decriminalize marijuana.
[1:54:23.400 --> 1:54:24.720]  Just get off the state's backs.
[1:54:24.720 --> 1:54:25.960]  What is wrong with sessions?
[1:54:25.960 --> 1:54:28.160]  I mean, my God, man, like, weren't we supposed to...
[1:54:28.160 --> 1:54:30.440]  Trump would get the entire real left off his back.
[1:54:30.440 --> 1:54:35.200]  I know all the weed guys in California, they're all fans of Trump because they hate the cartels
[1:54:35.200 --> 1:54:36.200]  because the cartels are coming.
[1:54:36.200 --> 1:54:37.200]  I'm trying to kill them.
[1:54:37.200 --> 1:54:38.920]  So we legalize weed in California.
[1:54:38.920 --> 1:54:39.920]  And what happens?
[1:54:39.920 --> 1:54:42.040]  All the cartels come and they try to kill these guys.
[1:54:42.040 --> 1:54:43.320]  We're just trying to build businesses.
[1:54:43.320 --> 1:54:45.320]  So, you know, they want to help Trump.
[1:54:45.320 --> 1:54:47.600]  And of course, sessions comes in and wants to steal their stuff.
[1:54:47.600 --> 1:54:48.600]  It's not okay.
[1:54:48.600 --> 1:54:53.920]  We got to get out of the 1960s mindset on these endless reefer madness wars.
[1:54:53.920 --> 1:54:54.920]  Stupid stuff.
[1:54:54.920 --> 1:54:58.560]  Well, I want to get you back routinely, Chuck Johnson, very impressive, the words you're
[1:54:58.560 --> 1:54:59.560]  doing.
[1:54:59.560 --> 1:55:05.040]  But what an honor that you and I, infowars.com, gottenus.com, we got to be the group they
[1:55:05.040 --> 1:55:06.040]  quote, banned.
[1:55:06.040 --> 1:55:07.720]  I mean, how dangerous is that in America?
[1:55:07.720 --> 1:55:10.080]  How kind of setting the president like he's an idiot?
[1:55:10.080 --> 1:55:13.160]  Oh, watch what you give Billy down in the basement.
[1:55:13.160 --> 1:55:14.760]  You know, he might do anything.
[1:55:14.760 --> 1:55:19.560]  And what was it was stuff like, rents previous is going to get fired this Friday happens
[1:55:19.560 --> 1:55:24.440]  or it was, Google's got cameras watching it was all confirmed.
[1:55:24.440 --> 1:55:29.440]  Or they then misrepresent what we say, folks shouldn't believe when they say we said something,
[1:55:29.440 --> 1:55:30.440]  go to the source.
[1:55:30.440 --> 1:55:31.440]  Go to the source.
[1:55:31.440 --> 1:55:32.440]  Go to the source.
[1:55:32.440 --> 1:55:33.440]  They will lie.
[1:55:33.440 --> 1:55:36.880]  They say I said kids are on Mars that I'm a UFO guy.
[1:55:36.880 --> 1:55:39.360]  I don't even cover UFOs.
[1:55:39.360 --> 1:55:41.800]  Never have it all over the news this weekend.
[1:55:41.800 --> 1:55:42.800]  Hundreds of articles.
[1:55:42.800 --> 1:55:45.920]  Joseph says alien slaves are on Mars.
[1:55:45.920 --> 1:55:52.120]  I had one guest who was high level CIA that on 15 years and he goes, Martian kids, Martian
[1:55:52.120 --> 1:55:54.560]  kids on the Mars to burn me.
[1:55:54.560 --> 1:55:55.560]  Yeah.
[1:55:55.560 --> 1:55:56.560]  I didn't say that.
[1:55:56.560 --> 1:55:58.060]  I didn't say that.
[1:55:58.060 --> 1:55:59.440]  But people are free to email me.
[1:55:59.440 --> 1:56:03.840]  I mean, I could be reached out to editor at gotnews.com, you can hit me up, ask me a
[1:56:03.840 --> 1:56:04.840]  questions.
[1:56:04.840 --> 1:56:05.840]  I'm, I'm fairly responsive.
[1:56:05.840 --> 1:56:07.480]  I even hired people who've emailed me before.
[1:56:07.480 --> 1:56:10.520]  So this idea that like, see, we care about the people.
[1:56:10.520 --> 1:56:11.640]  We actually engage with them.
[1:56:11.640 --> 1:56:14.560]  It's like, they're like the old Catholic church that didn't engage.
[1:56:14.560 --> 1:56:16.040]  It was like hiding and everything.
[1:56:16.040 --> 1:56:18.720]  And we're like the street preachers trying to save people.
[1:56:18.720 --> 1:56:20.760]  And this is why I like people.
[1:56:20.760 --> 1:56:21.760]  I value.
[1:56:21.760 --> 1:56:22.760]  Sure.
[1:56:22.760 --> 1:56:23.760]  I'm not like, Oh, I like you.
[1:56:23.760 --> 1:56:25.360]  I'm a psychopath saying I like you.
[1:56:25.360 --> 1:56:26.360]  I am you.
[1:56:26.360 --> 1:56:27.360]  Yeah, man.
[1:56:27.360 --> 1:56:31.000]  I mean, we're, we're, we're just, we have just been fortunate enough to come about right
[1:56:31.000 --> 1:56:32.000]  now.
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:34.600]  When I see somebody getting screwed over, I take it as personal.
[1:56:34.600 --> 1:56:35.600]  It's real empathy.
[1:56:35.600 --> 1:56:36.600]  Cause then that's normal.
[1:56:36.600 --> 1:56:40.280]  If something I'm getting screwed, you, like people say, well, why'd you help our pile?
[1:56:40.280 --> 1:56:41.280]  He was out of power.
[1:56:41.280 --> 1:56:43.280]  Cause they could put my ass in prison next.
[1:56:43.280 --> 1:56:44.280]  Yeah, man.
[1:56:44.280 --> 1:56:47.440]  And I told our pioneer, they come after me, buddy, you're going to line up and help me.
[1:56:47.440 --> 1:56:50.000]  Well, I mean, I said to Assange, that's selfishness.
[1:56:50.000 --> 1:56:52.080]  I went to empathy is selfish.
[1:56:52.080 --> 1:56:53.080]  I agree.
[1:56:53.080 --> 1:56:55.640]  I went to see Assange and I said, and Assange is like, why are you trying to help me get
[1:56:55.640 --> 1:56:57.480]  out of the Ecuadorian embassy?
[1:56:57.480 --> 1:57:00.480]  And I said, because I think that you would do the same thing for me if the tables were
[1:57:00.480 --> 1:57:01.480]  reversed.
[1:57:01.480 --> 1:57:02.480]  And that's sort of what we've got to be doing.
[1:57:02.480 --> 1:57:07.240]  We got to keep aggressively helping one another and building each other up so that we become
[1:57:07.240 --> 1:57:08.240]  a real movement.
[1:57:08.240 --> 1:57:10.240]  And the trick is not to be the alternative media anymore.
[1:57:10.240 --> 1:57:11.240]  It's to make them the alternative.
[1:57:11.240 --> 1:57:12.240]  I agree.
[1:57:12.240 --> 1:57:13.240]  We, they're the lying media.
[1:57:13.240 --> 1:57:14.560]  We're the folks trying to be accurate.
[1:57:14.560 --> 1:57:15.560]  We're not God.
[1:57:15.560 --> 1:57:16.560]  We're not arrogant.
[1:57:16.560 --> 1:57:18.520]  We don't say we're allowed to look at WikiLeaks, but you can.
[1:57:18.520 --> 1:57:21.240]  Hey, look at WikiLeaks and help us find what's in it.
[1:57:21.240 --> 1:57:23.520]  You are info or you are gotten it.
[1:57:23.520 --> 1:57:25.760]  And if you've got great stuff, I'll publish it and hire you.
[1:57:25.760 --> 1:57:27.280]  I mean, why not?
[1:57:27.280 --> 1:57:28.280]  Exactly.
[1:57:28.280 --> 1:57:29.280]  All right.
[1:57:29.280 --> 1:57:30.280]  Thanks for coming in.

[1:57:33.280 --> 1:57:34.280]  All right.
[1:57:34.280 --> 1:57:35.280]  I'll be back tomorrow.
[1:57:35.280 --> 1:57:36.280]  Lord willing with our reporters in Houston.
