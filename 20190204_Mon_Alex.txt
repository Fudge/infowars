[01:00.560 --> 01:04.480]  have come together a lot of really important things have come into focus
[01:04.480 --> 01:10.040]  and the globalist and their operations are just getting more and more out of
[01:10.040 --> 01:14.680]  control and more and more insane and as the public revolts against them they're
[01:14.680 --> 01:19.400]  only resisting the people with more bullying more censorship more attacks
[01:19.400 --> 01:27.200]  which is only out raising the public that much faster gab mcginnis filed
[01:27.200 --> 01:32.840]  lawsuit today in Alabama against the Southern Poverty Law Center an
[01:32.840 --> 01:37.160]  international crime syndicate that actually creates fake KKK and white
[01:37.160 --> 01:40.840]  supremacist groups they were heavily involved in Oklahoma City they have
[01:40.840 --> 01:47.360]  billions in secret slush funds overseas that have been exposed they are the
[01:47.360 --> 01:53.800]  heart of the globalist criminal operation and they're also the core of
[01:53.800 --> 01:58.280]  working with the big banks and working with the big Hollywood cartels to ban
[01:58.280 --> 02:04.400]  and demonize even mainline Christian and conservative organizations so they
[02:04.400 --> 02:08.360]  are the closest thing to Nazis we have in America trying to keep people out of
[02:08.360 --> 02:14.480]  commerce out of free speech very very dangerous group powerful press release
[02:14.480 --> 02:20.560]  up on info wars.com dealing with the fact that he filed the suit in fact we
[02:20.560 --> 02:24.000]  had it up first this morning then added the press release earlier we'd agreed
[02:24.000 --> 02:28.080]  to not release the press release until 8 a.m. this morning powerful press release
[02:28.080 --> 02:35.400]  and he's filing a big lawsuit there against them this is part of survival
[02:35.400 --> 02:39.760]  for himself everybody else so he'll be exclusively joining us via the telephone
[02:39.760 --> 02:44.960]  in the next segment and then in about an hour or so they're set to have a live
[02:44.960 --> 02:50.240]  press conference we've got a feed of that that will run part of coming up oh
[02:50.240 --> 02:53.120]  now he's joining us via Skype earlier it was going to be phones they'll be
[02:53.120 --> 02:57.160]  joining us via Skype coming up on the other side of this quick break but he's
[02:57.160 --> 03:02.280]  striking back and we want to commend him for the work he's doing stand with
[03:02.280 --> 03:10.440]  Gavin McGuinness and again that's defend Gavin.com so we'll be carrying all
[03:10.440 --> 03:15.000]  that at info wars.com where we have the feed ladies and gentlemen so that's
[03:15.000 --> 03:20.520]  coming up next segment this is just your run of the mill article info wars.com
[03:20.520 --> 03:25.120]  Austria white girls wearing headscarves to prevent harassment from Muslim
[03:25.120 --> 03:33.160]  migrants Ron Paul shut down the TSA Peter Schiff financial crisis bigger than
[03:33.160 --> 03:39.280]  2008 is incoming that's just some of the important news we're gonna be getting
[03:39.280 --> 03:44.200]  and then you know I've been pretty much ignoring Joe Rogan because he has a
[03:44.200 --> 03:48.400]  long-form podcast I've known him for almost I guess it's 20 years now or
[03:48.400 --> 03:51.600]  more but I hadn't really paid attention to what he'd been up to the last few
[03:51.600 --> 03:58.720]  years now that's what is investigating him my lord wow he's a much worse actor
[03:58.720 --> 04:05.200]  than I thought bad actor and he's doing things and Jack Dorsey's doing things
[04:05.200 --> 04:11.760]  that sent Martha Stewart to prison so I mean you scratch the surface with Rogan
[04:11.760 --> 04:17.240]  it's just stunningly criminal in my view and I'm just ashamed of myself for
[04:17.240 --> 04:22.280]  not doing more by the way his audience has completely turned on him 50,000
[04:22.280 --> 04:27.080]  downvotes to 7,000 point nine and that's even with them deleting a lot of the
[04:27.080 --> 04:30.880]  downvotes I was watching in live time last night it's fascinating all his
[04:30.880 --> 04:34.040]  videos are being downloaded tens of thousands of people are unsubscribing
[04:34.040 --> 04:37.240]  every few hours everyone's turning against him separate from what I've been
[04:37.240 --> 04:43.280]  exposing and his response is YouTube's announced this is official they're
[04:43.280 --> 04:49.920]  removing the downvote for their poor baby Joe Rogan he is their operative I had
[04:49.920 --> 04:55.160]  no idea he has if he hadn't joined the dark side before he's joined it totally
[04:55.160 --> 04:58.400]  pure pure evil
[04:58.400 --> 05:15.160]  my leaps and my bounds the number one best-selling supplement family in the
[05:15.160 --> 05:20.040]  world is energy drinks and energy supplements but they are riddled with
[05:20.040 --> 05:25.040]  dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a
[05:25.040 --> 05:28.880]  quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects we
[05:28.880 --> 05:33.600]  have developed hands down from our research the most powerful healthy
[05:33.600 --> 05:38.720]  energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world there's nothing else
[05:38.720 --> 05:43.720]  like it must experience it it is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use
[05:43.720 --> 05:48.080]  packets to mix it with fruit juice or water whatever you'd like warning though
[05:48.080 --> 05:52.080]  it's very very strong it lasts 10 hours so take a half packet the first time you
[05:52.080 --> 05:55.560]  take it because turbo force is named turbo force because it will take you
[05:55.560 --> 06:01.040]  into overdrive turbo force and in force live com
[06:01.040 --> 06:20.800]  in for wars tomorrow's news today
[06:20.800 --> 06:35.560]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop
[06:35.560 --> 06:43.080]  tyranny well so does he live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's
[06:43.080 --> 06:52.000]  Alex Jones well Gavin McGinnis has been fired from his job he's been taking off
[06:52.000 --> 06:57.280]  almost every major platform it's out there just like you're truly because
[06:57.280 --> 07:01.040]  he's a patriot because he supports America because he stood up against the
[07:01.040 --> 07:05.640]  globalist and now today he's filed suit against the Southern Primary Law Center
[07:05.640 --> 07:12.840]  a true hate-filled evil anti-American organization as close to Nazis as you
[07:12.840 --> 07:17.480]  could actually get my view funding Nazi groups funding provocateurs heavily
[07:17.480 --> 07:21.040]  involved in Oklahoma City heavily involved just every form of evil you
[07:21.040 --> 07:26.000]  can imagine absolutely dedicated to destroying free speech and demonizing
[07:26.000 --> 07:30.480]  good people and kicking people even out of commerce so the general public is
[07:30.480 --> 07:35.720]  unable to even be able to have bank accounts if you're a mainline Christian
[07:35.720 --> 07:40.560]  or conservative group this is the new reign of terror the Chinese communist
[07:40.560 --> 07:46.000]  social score system that the Southern Poverty Law Center is in command of
[07:46.000 --> 07:51.960]  they're the ultimate arbiter even above the ADL even above media matters and
[07:51.960 --> 07:57.080]  then they give you the designation of the scarlet letter or the yellow star and
[07:57.080 --> 08:04.400]  you are disappeared into an electronic gulag just absolutely stunning and a
[08:04.400 --> 08:12.640]  very powerful press release is up on info wars.com and Gavin goes through all
[08:12.640 --> 08:15.800]  of this and coming up about an hour he's gonna have a big press conference
[08:15.800 --> 08:20.160]  that we're gonna be streaming live at info wars.com here on this show we'll
[08:20.160 --> 08:24.320]  be simulcasting you can also go to defend Gavin.com but they've gone to his
[08:24.320 --> 08:32.480]  house and harassed his family they have come out and said Mary Poppins is
[08:32.480 --> 08:38.520]  racist the leftist groups are now saying that Boston is racist itself and
[08:38.520 --> 08:43.600]  because half the football team is white that it's a white supremacist football
[08:43.600 --> 08:50.200]  team even though the NFL is like 80% black. Ladies and gentlemen this is the
[08:50.200 --> 08:53.800]  left totally projecting race-based politics to divide and conquer this
[08:53.800 --> 08:58.520]  country and Gavin is a hero for standing up to them and supporting me when I was
[08:58.520 --> 09:03.080]  being de-platformed that he got the platform he's he didn't cut and run so
[09:03.080 --> 09:07.160]  go to defendgavin.com and support him there because this is really a critical
[09:07.160 --> 09:10.840]  fight. Gavin thanks for giving us the first exclusive on this out of your press
[09:10.840 --> 09:15.280]  conference really appreciate you my friend. Thanks for having me buddy. Well
[09:15.280 --> 09:19.920]  your press release really says it all but talk about why you're doing this. Well
[09:19.920 --> 09:25.520]  I'm doing this not because of me and I did get brutally battered with social
[09:25.520 --> 09:31.720]  media and PayPal and being doxxed and my family and friends being attacked and my
[09:31.720 --> 09:36.360]  buddies the proud boys getting rounded up and arrested and charged with felonies
[09:36.360 --> 09:41.320]  for defending themselves that's obviously a big part of this impetus but
[09:41.320 --> 09:46.720]  I'm also doing it for the average American. I mean the SPLC has positioned
[09:46.720 --> 09:52.520]  themselves with such immense power that they are now infiltrating not just big
[09:52.520 --> 09:56.560]  tech where they decide who can say what but they're getting involved in banking
[09:56.560 --> 10:00.400]  and they're getting involved with the way everyone can do business. They're
[10:00.400 --> 10:04.240]  bankrupting people and they're ruining innocent people careers. I mean I'm
[10:04.240 --> 10:09.680]  doing this as much for me as I'm doing it for deputy Brian Green who was fired
[10:09.680 --> 10:15.760]  from Louisiana law enforcement for being a proud boy. This guy volunteered doing
[10:15.760 --> 10:19.880]  women's self-defense on the weekends. He's a stalwart of the community graduated
[10:19.880 --> 10:23.520]  head of his class in the Academy and he's now lucky if he can get air
[10:23.520 --> 10:28.600]  conditioning work or Jennifer Morse from the Ruth Institute who dared to say
[10:28.600 --> 10:33.120]  that when we're adopting kids maybe we should air on the side of mother father
[10:33.120 --> 10:39.520]  parents as opposed to gay parents. That's all she said and her bank called her up
[10:39.520 --> 10:45.920]  and said no you can't bank with us anymore. Why are we giving these bratty
[10:45.920 --> 10:52.400]  busybodies power over all of our lives it doesn't bode well for America. And your
[10:52.400 --> 10:55.960]  press release and what your law firm has pointed out is absolutely on target
[10:55.960 --> 11:01.160]  110%. It is a consortium of leftist so-called watchdog groups Southern
[11:01.160 --> 11:04.360]  Parvy Law Center with billions of secret offshore accounts that's been admitted
[11:04.360 --> 11:08.280]  all their sort of corruption all the lawsuits they've been losing. On record
[11:08.280 --> 11:12.640]  saying we want to destroy Gavin McGinnis we want to destroy Alex Jones these are
[11:12.640 --> 11:17.680]  quotes then they go out and say lies about us that are then picked up and
[11:17.680 --> 11:23.120]  expanded out from there and projected everywhere to where we get called Nazis
[11:23.120 --> 11:26.760]  people can put things in our yards they threaten our families you've been through
[11:26.760 --> 11:31.440]  it I've been through it and it's just absolutely racketeering to have big tech
[11:31.440 --> 11:35.520]  with banks with the mainstream media with the Southern Parvy Law Center as the
[11:35.520 --> 11:41.000]  quote judge jury and executioner and when they hang that that scarlet letter
[11:41.000 --> 11:45.320]  around your neck when they put that yellow star on you you are being sent
[11:45.320 --> 11:49.400]  to total unemployment and being physically attacked I mean and they
[11:49.400 --> 11:53.880]  admit these are bullying monsters and if you study what the Nazis did for the
[11:53.880 --> 11:56.960]  first few years they didn't really kill people they just took your banking away
[11:56.960 --> 12:01.720]  and took your stores away and took your shops away. Yeah they put signs in your
[12:01.720 --> 12:06.560]  window that said this is a Jew shop don't shop here and we're getting this
[12:06.560 --> 12:11.200]  now with this hey there's no home here in shop windows I mean or Proud Boys getting
[12:11.200 --> 12:14.280]  kicked out of various bars they're not allowed to go to this establishment or
[12:14.280 --> 12:17.080]  that establishment but I'm glad you brought up earlier the electronic
[12:17.080 --> 12:22.000]  gulag this is actually worse than communism because in communism you would
[12:22.000 --> 12:26.240]  go to the gulag you'd go to the reeducation camp and you'd come back
[12:26.240 --> 12:32.680]  vindicated in today's America with this witch hunt you're never vindicated so
[12:32.680 --> 12:36.640]  once you're a bigot once you're a homophobe, racist, transphobic, anti-semai
[12:36.640 --> 12:41.440]  whatever that's permanently on your record thanks to the SPLC and you can
[12:41.440 --> 12:45.520]  never recover from that but the people that I'm representing here the people
[12:45.520 --> 12:50.360]  that I'm fighting for they'll always be googleable as part of a hate group and
[12:50.360 --> 12:54.560]  they you know the SPLC starts with bonafide bigots maybe like five percent
[12:54.560 --> 12:58.720]  of their total list and then they just spread that out and include everyone
[12:58.720 --> 13:02.920]  remotely Christian everyone remotely conservative and they make this massive
[13:02.920 --> 13:09.600]  hate map that makes America look like a racist hellhole and that's really why
[13:09.600 --> 13:14.120]  I'm fighting because I'm sick of this depiction of all of us being prejudice
[13:14.120 --> 13:20.040]  it's not true. At the same time you point out that they literally create heat maps
[13:20.040 --> 13:24.480]  that just act like America is like almost every white person is a frothing
[13:24.480 --> 13:29.680]  KKK member and then a lot of minorities now a minority of them are becoming
[13:29.680 --> 13:33.960]  hardcore racist and actually saying whites inherently are evil like New York
[13:33.960 --> 13:38.600]  Times board members and mainstream media hosts they're the ones mainlining hate
[13:38.600 --> 13:42.120]  I mean these people say things more hateful than David Duke does I don't
[13:42.120 --> 13:48.360]  support David Duke but David Duke is a gentleman compared to to the lady at the
[13:48.360 --> 13:52.960]  New York Times that calls whites subhuman goblins that live in holes she
[13:52.960 --> 13:56.720]  can't wait till they all die I mean I don't like what David Duke has to say
[13:56.720 --> 14:01.840]  but he doesn't say kill all the black people this is outrageous. No they're
[14:01.840 --> 14:06.520]  getting people killed and when you depict America as this racist hellhole
[14:06.520 --> 14:11.640]  where cops hunt black people for sport then a black guy is in a dangerous
[14:11.640 --> 14:15.000]  confrontations he say did something wrong and he's fighting with the cops he
[14:15.000 --> 14:19.000]  thinks well I'm gonna die anyway I might as well go out in a blaze of glory and
[14:19.000 --> 14:22.800]  the next thing you know he's wielding a weapon going well these cops are all
[14:22.800 --> 14:26.280]  racist I might as well keep fighting till I die and now you just got that guy and
[14:26.280 --> 14:29.400]  then CNN says well cops are bad that's why they're getting killed a few years
[14:29.400 --> 14:32.720]  ago I don't even got to go but I want to finish up on the other side how people
[14:32.720 --> 14:35.680]  can support you and and what's gonna happen the press conference today but
[14:35.680 --> 14:39.960]  just briefly it's in your press release too multiple people have been shot and
[14:39.960 --> 14:45.360]  attacked by SPLC minions operating off their heat map I mean they use this as
[14:45.360 --> 14:51.120]  like a guidance system for their missiles. Yes the Family Research Council the
[14:51.120 --> 14:56.160]  black security guard was shot defending them and that the guy who shot them said
[14:56.160 --> 15:00.000]  he wanted to kill as many people as he could the Steve Scalise shooting was
[15:00.000 --> 15:03.440]  based on the SPLC hate group just the other day Charles Murray was at
[15:03.440 --> 15:08.800]  Middlebury College and the students were so rabid that they attacked a professor
[15:08.800 --> 15:12.960]  who got in the way of the attack was hospitalized this is all due to the SPLC's
[15:12.960 --> 15:20.640]  hate group they are fomenting hate they are a hate group. Well also Proud Boys is a
[15:20.640 --> 15:25.560]  defensive organization and it takes any color take a lot of gay guys in it
[15:25.560 --> 15:30.800]  whatever and and the idea that that this was some offensive group no they stood
[15:30.800 --> 15:36.240]  up to bullies they defended themselves. Remember those Catholic boys the other
[15:36.240 --> 15:43.680]  day who were accused of something in ceremony. They said that they. Oh let's talk about the other side Gavin.
[15:43.680 --> 15:46.520]  Gavin stay there let's finish up with that and your press conference coming up.

[20:23.280 --> 20:29.080]  I gotta tell you Alex Jones here back live Gavin was here in town a few months
[20:29.080 --> 20:35.920]  ago he was really down and he was taking calls from his wife who he didn't say it
[20:35.920 --> 20:40.200]  was off record maybe that I mean basically well let's just say she was in
[20:40.200 --> 20:43.920]  trouble neighbors threatening him harassing their kids everything else
[20:43.920 --> 20:52.360]  and he was depressed but now to see him back on the offense is really an awesome
[20:52.360 --> 20:56.080]  thing because I've been looking at groups and we're looking at soon the
[20:56.080 --> 20:59.800]  Southern Providence Law Center that lawyers are last week three times very
[20:59.800 --> 21:03.600]  prominent ones and we have all these powerful suits to get them off our backs
[21:03.600 --> 21:09.520]  it's just which one's the best there's a famous author whose English who said a
[21:09.520 --> 21:13.000]  bunch of horrible stuff about me yesterday who I can tell you right now is
[21:13.000 --> 21:20.760]  the prime target he said I'm sending people currently to kill parents of
[21:20.760 --> 21:28.080]  Parkland students you talk about dangerous as hell to have a prominent
[21:28.080 --> 21:34.040]  author and actor on YouTube saying we must take Jones down he must not be
[21:34.040 --> 21:41.000]  tolerated showing flaming swastikas while he says it and he shows no proof but
[21:41.000 --> 21:45.000]  it's like what's a famous actor I'm gonna get to it later so I couldn't sleep
[21:45.000 --> 21:48.560]  last night I woke up at like 3 a.m. I texted my lawyer and I said I think this
[21:48.560 --> 21:54.600]  is this is patient zero for us but then I'm in my email inbox hey here's your
[21:54.600 --> 21:59.120]  email don't go with this till 8 a.m. we're going to you follow suit tomorrow so
[21:59.120 --> 22:03.680]  I'm glad to have Gavin McInnis here with us again founder of vice they took it
[22:03.680 --> 22:08.360]  over and ruined it then so many other big things and he she's having to fight
[22:08.360 --> 22:12.200]  back because they ruined his life they they took his bank accounts away they
[22:12.200 --> 22:16.920]  took his PayPal away he got fired from CRTV where he was number one another
[22:16.920 --> 22:20.080]  reason he got fired yeah you think you think you get promoted with your number
[22:20.080 --> 22:24.640]  one no now when there's other guys above you that are older you get you get
[22:24.640 --> 22:28.680]  fired that's how the world really works we are the top race car driver or the top
[22:28.680 --> 22:32.200]  fighter until you've cemented yourself forever there's people gunning for us
[22:32.200 --> 22:35.520]  so Gavin in the six seven minutes we have left get into again why you're
[22:35.520 --> 22:39.560]  doing this the press conference is coming up but first you got interrupted
[22:39.560 --> 22:44.440]  by the break you were bringing up the parallels to the Kentucky Catholic
[22:44.440 --> 22:50.600]  school students who got totally set up totally demonized and called Nazis for
[22:50.600 --> 22:55.480]  standing their ground just incredible yeah and that was an actual quote I
[22:55.480 --> 23:00.320]  watched CNN that morning and they said this is a quote the woman interviewing
[23:00.320 --> 23:07.080]  one of the boys said uh isn't it kind of aggressive standing your ground and I
[23:07.080 --> 23:12.320]  was just floored by that question the fact that standing up for yourself is
[23:12.320 --> 23:17.120]  now considered aggressive the fact that not bowing your head in shame and just
[23:17.120 --> 23:21.920]  being submissive is now considered aggressive shows where we are as a
[23:21.920 --> 23:28.040]  country we have to be drenched in shame at all times and apologize constantly
[23:28.040 --> 23:33.080]  or we're being aggressive no we're not being aggressive we're telling the
[23:33.080 --> 23:37.000]  truth we're being honest about who we are we're not bigots we're not trans folks
[23:37.000 --> 23:40.840]  not homophobes not blah blah blah of folk we don't disrupt in indigenous
[23:40.840 --> 23:46.440]  ceremonies that is all a lie and I think it's time that we started writing back
[23:46.440 --> 23:49.400]  at your first instinct when all this happens is I'm just gonna get out of
[23:49.400 --> 23:53.280]  the way these people are nuts you know say say a crazy ex-girlfriend was outside
[23:53.280 --> 23:56.800]  your house throwing bricks at your house and screaming you still love me you'd
[23:56.800 --> 24:00.520]  be like I need to get away from her no well I've had enough of that I've had
[24:00.520 --> 24:04.280]  enough of hiding from the crazy ex-girlfriend the left is got Trump
[24:04.280 --> 24:07.960]  derangement syndrome to the point of extreme mental illness and we have to
[24:07.960 --> 24:15.400]  stand up to this crazy bitch and say calm down you lunatic I'm not letting you
[24:15.400 --> 24:20.800]  ruin my life how is your wife feeling I don't want to say things on there I
[24:20.800 --> 24:24.120]  shouldn't but I mean you really should describe to people you almost had to
[24:24.120 --> 24:28.200]  get back on a plane and go home a lot of I mean this has been life-wrecking for
[24:28.200 --> 24:32.000]  you you're not just because the media is already oh poor Gavin oh you just lost
[24:32.000 --> 24:36.040]  your job everything else big deal you not see what's it been like for your
[24:36.040 --> 24:41.480]  wife she turned a corner I mean she's a Hillary supporter she's a Democrat she's
[24:41.480 --> 24:47.240]  a vegan and I think she realized that her people are insane now she's not a
[24:47.240 --> 24:51.640]  Republican but I think she's at least gonna be independent she's sort of she
[24:51.640 --> 24:56.240]  was beaten beaten they they had her you know hysterical and and crying in bed
[24:56.240 --> 25:00.560]  all day and then I think she sort of reached a tipping point where she said
[25:00.560 --> 25:08.720]  this isn't just and my husband's not an evil Nazi F these people and she she
[25:08.720 --> 25:13.240]  sort of got an extra layer of skin and now you know behind every great man is a
[25:13.240 --> 25:18.320]  great woman and my woman is is fully on board I was reading about the last two
[25:18.320 --> 25:21.680]  months you guys reached out you wrote letters you went knocked on people's
[25:21.680 --> 25:25.880]  doors with your children and that turns into you're harassing the neighbors that
[25:25.880 --> 25:29.640]  stick signs in your yard saying you're a Nazi I mean these people are out of
[25:29.640 --> 25:35.280]  control drama queen liars yes and it's a it's a small percentage 95 percent of
[25:35.280 --> 25:39.720]  people in the burbs anywhere you go in any community just want their kids to be
[25:39.720 --> 25:44.160]  happy their kids to be educated their kids to be healthy but this 5% these
[25:44.160 --> 25:47.440]  shrill limousine liberals who think they're fighting the good fight because
[25:47.440 --> 25:52.040]  they have a bumper sticker are very effective when it comes to domestic
[25:52.040 --> 25:57.640]  care and they really can they really can harass your family you know this is
[25:57.640 --> 26:01.240]  what how they won the Boer war the English they started terrorizing though
[26:01.240 --> 26:06.040]  the women and children and that's what what took the soldiers down and the
[26:06.040 --> 26:11.880]  far left they are doubling down for the next two years and they're so determined
[26:11.880 --> 26:16.320]  to to make America look racist they can get Trump out of office that though
[26:16.320 --> 26:19.720]  they'll stop at anything and they're lying to themselves first of all
[26:19.720 --> 26:23.640]  pretending there's racists everywhere but let's talk about in closing here we'll
[26:23.640 --> 26:26.360]  obviously get back in the next few days because like you said you've been out of
[26:26.360 --> 26:29.920]  commission getting the suit ready but now you're ready to you know come out
[26:29.920 --> 26:34.360]  politically guns a blazing or out of the out of the shoot like a bat out of
[26:34.360 --> 26:38.880]  hell here thank God and again we're all admiring what you're doing again
[26:38.880 --> 26:42.920]  and writing to get involved and support what you're doing how do people do that
[26:42.920 --> 26:46.640]  and let's talk about the suit itself which is linked up on info wars calm
[26:46.640 --> 26:51.520]  it's also up on your site defend Gavin calm because you got a pretty good suit
[26:51.520 --> 26:54.840]  here they're saying they want to destroy you they're lying about you and they got
[26:54.840 --> 26:58.880]  you fired and took you off everywhere and then brag about it for fundraisers I
[26:58.880 --> 27:04.920]  mean these people are the definition of what the Nazis did well the crazy thing
[27:04.920 --> 27:08.320]  about all this is they want to replace the courts they want to replace the
[27:08.320 --> 27:12.440]  justice system they want to become judge jury and executioner and you go okay I
[27:12.440 --> 27:16.120]  understand that but I assume you're going to be very judicial about the way you
[27:16.120 --> 27:20.760]  speak and everything yet at the same time they have this snarky babysitter tone
[27:20.760 --> 27:25.000]  where they have headlines but like you want bigots gathered this is how you get
[27:25.000 --> 27:30.920]  bigots so it's like Becky is running the SPLC so they're destroying people's
[27:30.920 --> 27:35.920]  lives they're destroying businesses they're ruining careers and the face of
[27:35.920 --> 27:40.360]  the company is just this snarky mean girl from high school it's bizarre that
[27:40.360 --> 27:47.760]  we've given Becky this immense power to crush people's lives based on lies I it's
[27:47.760 --> 27:52.040]  unprecedented in history really wait till I tell you what I discovered about Joe
[27:52.040 --> 27:57.720]  Rogan he is actively in Google in Twitter with him works for him gets money
[27:57.720 --> 28:01.800]  from him doesn't tell people during interviews he's doing infomercials with
[28:01.800 --> 28:05.880]  Jack Gorsy and they've got a whole rollout censorship plan that he is now
[28:05.880 --> 28:09.840]  captaining and anyone that criticizes him is being deleted off YouTube so Joe
[28:09.840 --> 28:15.240]  Rogan has literally knelt in for a palpatine Wow I didn't know anything
[28:15.240 --> 28:19.800]  about that that's amazing you know this is what happens in this culture of fear

[33:07.880 --> 33:37.840]  All right folks Alex Jones here in
[33:37.840 --> 33:43.760]  you know I've really been soul-searching about how honest I should be with the
[33:43.760 --> 33:53.160]  audience I want to be clear you fire musket battle run you through
[33:55.280 --> 34:05.360]  crank it up you better stand turn back the bugle sounds the charge begins
[34:05.360 --> 34:10.800]  all right getting back what I was saying I am neurotically honest about
[34:10.800 --> 34:16.760]  everything I do on here in fact if I feel like saying something kind of nasty
[34:16.760 --> 34:23.960]  I say it even though I shouldn't it's a family show and I committed this morning
[34:24.200 --> 34:30.520]  to not every once in a while say nasty mean unprofessional things and I got
[34:30.520 --> 34:34.560]  on my knees this morning I said God at like 3 a.m. I couldn't sleep because I
[34:34.560 --> 34:36.960]  was feeling bad about some of the things I said on the show last week they
[34:36.960 --> 34:39.640]  weren't that bad compared to the right you know what I can't be like those
[34:39.640 --> 34:44.200]  people anyways that's just another side issue I start thinking about telling the
[34:44.200 --> 34:47.520]  truth I tell you about my own personal struggles so you understand that I'm
[34:47.520 --> 34:52.640]  trying to commit to you to be as good as I can but I get whacked out fighting the
[34:52.640 --> 34:57.760]  globalist where I don't care what they do to me so then psychological governors
[34:57.760 --> 35:05.200]  are taken off where I'm not compartmentalized I'm wide open okay and
[35:05.200 --> 35:10.120]  you kind of go crazy when you're staring into the abyss of the abyss all
[35:10.120 --> 35:14.360]  days when trying to say and again these are a lot of emotions it's it's it's
[35:14.360 --> 35:20.360]  hard to even describe what I'm trying to get out here it's just I get wild on
[35:20.360 --> 35:24.200]  air sometimes and I don't do it on purpose and some of it's good and some
[35:24.200 --> 35:27.720]  of it's bad and I understand the world such a serious place that I need to
[35:27.720 --> 35:33.480]  reign it in at 45 years old and be more professional because things are very
[35:33.480 --> 35:40.200]  serious but at the same time my information is accurate but I have gone
[35:40.200 --> 35:45.080]  kind of crazy so and that's just that just goes with the territory when you
[35:45.080 --> 35:49.400]  start getting persecuted for many many years on end and you go through a lot
[35:49.400 --> 35:54.960]  of persecution and you make yourself adapt to it and overcome it it's like
[35:54.960 --> 36:01.400]  that Narls Barkley song I don't know how to describe it but he talks about once
[36:01.400 --> 36:08.240]  he went crazy he had so much more emotion and also so much space and that's
[36:08.240 --> 36:12.960]  what it's like when you go past these barriers and do things other people
[36:12.960 --> 36:19.880]  haven't done and you you conquer these demons thanks to God's help at the same
[36:19.880 --> 36:26.920]  time every time you conquer a demon with God's help you're still a man and you
[36:26.920 --> 36:31.400]  take a little piece of that bugger along with you and I prayed to God to cleanse
[36:31.400 --> 36:39.760]  me and help me not be like this because if I get a diabolical mindset this
[36:39.760 --> 36:45.720]  morning I was working out with Pat Riley my buddy and I said no watch this Pat I'm
[36:45.720 --> 36:50.000]  gonna try to throw it like three times the range at that dartboard from a
[36:50.000 --> 36:54.600]  regular position and I hit the dartboard but barely and I said now I'm gonna turn
[36:54.600 --> 37:00.000]  over to evil watch this double bullseye and right by the bullseye I gave him to
[37:00.000 --> 37:06.280]  hate I just hated my enemies and it's like that's the dark side folks and I
[37:06.280 --> 37:09.960]  just like I don't know how to explain it because it's all just seething and ready
[37:09.960 --> 37:13.320]  to get these people because they think they've got the dark side they have no
[37:13.320 --> 37:22.080]  idea and I just and Riley was like that was amazing he saw it happen and I just
[37:22.080 --> 37:27.720]  don't know how to explain it it's just oh my god just thank you for putting up
[37:27.720 --> 37:31.760]  with me is all I'm saying and then I'll add this you know we're here supporting
[37:31.760 --> 37:34.440]  Roger Stone we're here supporting Gavin McGinnis who's an awesome guy and I
[37:34.440 --> 37:38.520]  admire and you're supporting me so I don't like coming up here and asking for
[37:38.520 --> 37:43.760]  your support all the time but you know what I'm in a total war and quite
[37:43.760 --> 37:47.640]  frankly back in the day we could bring in plenty of money before all the
[37:47.640 --> 37:52.880]  censorship and blocking I barely plugged and about a plug like an aunt and put
[37:52.880 --> 37:56.840]  away stuff for the winter instead of a grasshopper we wouldn't be nipping tuck
[37:56.840 --> 38:03.680]  right now but this is an ongoing savage war they took away almost all our
[38:03.680 --> 38:08.560]  sponsors it took away our ability to advertise online on most platforms they
[38:08.560 --> 38:12.920]  took most our banking away they financed all these fake lawsuits against me I
[38:12.920 --> 38:22.080]  got most of them thrown out same people filed more but here's the thing I know
[38:22.080 --> 38:27.440]  we can't give up because we've got a job to do into this fight into the crises
[38:27.440 --> 38:39.480]  that the globalist are starting and we have to be in the position into the
[38:39.480 --> 38:45.040]  future the enemy has done the analysis and they know that if we continue into
[38:45.040 --> 38:48.640]  the future they know on the timelines they've tracked in full wars is a
[38:48.640 --> 38:55.400]  critical chain reaction component to planetary victory for humanity they know
[38:55.400 --> 39:00.560]  that and so we have to step into that admission and step into that office and
[39:00.560 --> 39:07.000]  step into that responsibility myself included and you've got my commitment to
[39:07.000 --> 39:11.000]  do the best I can under this level of pressure the problem is it's not that
[39:11.000 --> 39:17.080]  the pressure grinds me down the pressure when I overcome it then I become a
[39:17.080 --> 39:24.320]  monster you understand I'm fighting not accessing worldly powers is what I'm
[39:24.320 --> 39:28.960]  trying to say because I can't use the devil's tricks I'm a very I'm trying to
[39:28.960 --> 39:32.520]  be a very good person and I'm not trying to give into the dark side you
[39:32.520 --> 39:38.120]  understand but as they put more pressure on me the it's beyond the
[39:38.120 --> 39:44.600]  temptation I start seething so just pray for me and I'm not whining I'm
[39:44.600 --> 39:54.240]  asking for financial support and I'm sure asking for prayers folks because you
[39:54.240 --> 39:57.240]  want to take care of people you love you want to be a good person you want to be
[39:57.240 --> 40:01.920]  evil but you cannot become it in the process that's how so many good men and
[40:01.920 --> 40:06.040]  women fell to evil fell to darkness was in the process of trying to beat it they
[40:06.040 --> 40:12.640]  became it I do not want to do that but I'm prone to it and I'm just I'm
[40:12.640 --> 40:17.120]  struggling because again instead of feeling weak like a victim it does the
[40:17.120 --> 40:22.640]  opposite but it's it's worse than being a victim because I don't want to become
[40:22.640 --> 40:28.040]  what the enemy wishes they were is what I'm trying to say I think I've explained
[40:28.040 --> 40:32.920]  that but I'm just you've got my commitment to the bus job I can our biggest
[40:32.920 --> 40:38.320]  stress is production time if I go out and shoot an ad an interesting location we
[40:38.320 --> 40:41.120]  sell product if I make the ad interesting we sell product I just said

[46:58.600 --> 47:08.040]  dot-com today you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:08.040 --> 47:34.320]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:38.040 --> 47:45.600]  we're on the march the empire is on the run all right I don't like doing what I've
[47:45.600 --> 47:52.160]  got to do next hour but I have discovered that Jack Dorsey and Joe Rogan
[47:52.160 --> 47:58.120]  are doing such horribly evil things to people that I'm ashamed of myself for
[47:58.120 --> 48:04.160]  not learning about it earlier now now quite frankly in fairness I mean we're
[48:04.160 --> 48:08.680]  covering the big global issues and what's happening and what's unfolding but
[48:08.680 --> 48:21.760]  hiding in plain view under my nose is a staking rats nest that deals with the
[48:21.760 --> 48:32.040]  internet takeover plans face scanning to buy and sell potential sec violations
[48:32.040 --> 48:36.600]  where they're promoting different cryptocurrencies but not telling you
[48:36.600 --> 48:41.680]  they're being paid to do it I mean you just saw a bunch of Floyd Waymother and
[48:41.680 --> 48:47.720]  bunch of others paid big fines over that and when I learned about this sort of
[48:47.720 --> 48:57.320]  researching it there was Jack Darcy of Twitter talking about it with Joe going
[48:57.320 --> 49:02.400]  oh and I've met with the SEC and we're being very careful how we do this he's
[49:02.400 --> 49:09.280]  such a snake oh looking down while he says it and they're not telling you he
[49:09.280 --> 49:14.960]  pays Joe millions of dollars to push particular cryptocurrencies and
[49:14.960 --> 49:20.520]  different cashless systems for a global government currency that they think Joe
[49:20.520 --> 49:32.720]  is the answer how pathetic 50,000 downvotes to 7,000 downvotes so
[49:36.600 --> 49:44.320]  all I could say is in the words of 20 Montana for a green card I'm gonna carve
[49:44.320 --> 49:56.560]  them up real good politically because watching this is so sick to watch Joe
[49:56.560 --> 50:06.920]  prey on his viewers and now I've got his whole his whole modus operandi what a
[50:06.920 --> 50:14.080]  snake man you know people can take like that snake like behaviors manly it's
[50:14.080 --> 50:19.960]  not it's a predator with eyes pointed straightforward looking right at you how
[50:19.960 --> 50:26.360]  he can game you and dominate you and control you period Joe Rogan is
[50:26.360 --> 50:31.080]  definitely a psychopath and so is Jack Dorsey so they're two disgusting little
[50:31.080 --> 50:36.520]  peas in a feted feted pod they can make our mannerisms and they can you know
[50:36.520 --> 50:40.480]  behave like we are but they are the traitor within they are the plague to
[50:40.480 --> 50:45.760]  quote Cicero so wait till I expose this this is up and this is just this is just
[50:45.760 --> 50:50.200]  one sponsor we believe is biggest word is three hundred thousand dollars a month
[50:50.200 --> 50:55.560]  Rogan's been getting for years never telling people that his main sponsor is
[50:55.560 --> 51:12.680]  Jack Dorsey unbelievable all hiding in plain view you know I got to thank the
[51:12.680 --> 51:16.680]  listeners for being all over my ass last few years about Joe and I just didn't
[51:16.680 --> 51:20.240]  listen to it because I'm too busy to listen to two hour long deals and I'm
[51:20.240 --> 51:24.200]  doing my own research and you know usually it's like DMT we you know this
[51:24.200 --> 51:31.160]  George Soros type stuff that's all an agenda that's been his sponsor is these
[51:31.160 --> 51:37.760]  big foundations and now it's making Jack Dorsey's digital system based on
[51:37.760 --> 51:42.160]  Bitcoin the new global currency when obviously they brought the global
[51:42.160 --> 51:47.120]  currency forward as a grassroots thing to make you adopt it like it's avant
[51:47.120 --> 51:52.080]  garde and radical and cashless and blockchain and it's so radical it tracks
[51:52.080 --> 51:56.400]  money's whole history oh great a total tracking of money throughout its history
[51:56.400 --> 52:03.640]  the opposite of cash how wonderful is this it's wonderful and Joe the whole
[52:03.640 --> 52:11.480]  time is looking down his notes it's all stuff written by Twitter oh I love your
[52:11.480 --> 52:16.320]  I guess all that company of yours what's the name it's so good it's so easy we all
[52:16.320 --> 52:21.240]  use it what's the name not even saying by the way that my biggest sponsors here
[52:21.240 --> 52:25.720]  Jack Dorsey and I'm here to do a pump and dump I'm sorry I said I get to the
[52:25.720 --> 52:32.960]  next hour it's just the sliminess of it God
[52:34.560 --> 52:39.000]  but that's why Joe Rogan loves Vegas so much because it's one thing to go to
[52:39.000 --> 52:42.520]  Vegas or once in a while but it's one thing to be a creature of it and to like
[52:42.520 --> 52:47.640]  it because I get into LA or Vegas man I'm like I don't have a soul here I
[52:47.640 --> 52:52.680]  something's wrong get me out of here danger will robins and danger I can't
[52:52.680 --> 52:59.120]  sleep in those cities I can't have fun in those cities because they're evil
[53:00.200 --> 53:04.160]  your city's got corruption but I feel good there it's different people and
[53:04.160 --> 53:14.640]  things going on but LA and Vegas are Muo movie Diablo all right I'm gonna stop
[53:14.640 --> 53:21.920]  right there I just you literally the old saying was why did the Sun never set on
[53:21.920 --> 53:28.240]  the English Empire or the British Empire and that's just God wouldn't trust an
[53:28.240 --> 53:35.880]  Englishman in the dark that was the old saying that you scratch a pirate find an
[53:35.880 --> 53:49.000]  Englishman was the old saying and you you you pull back from this and it's so
[53:49.000 --> 53:53.680]  diabolical see I woke up at like 2.33 in the morning can go back to sleep so I
[53:53.680 --> 53:58.520]  got in front of the computer the other big screen computer and I was like well
[53:58.520 --> 54:03.200]  I know sorry my brain already prime projected already had enough data points
[54:03.200 --> 54:07.960]  but I was like let me guess George has been in Bitcoin a long time let me guess
[54:07.960 --> 54:12.280]  I bet he dumped his right when it went down sure enough exactly what he did and
[54:12.280 --> 54:16.120]  then he's they're doing a dead cat bounce trying to suck her in the next
[54:16.120 --> 54:20.360]  group and so now they're trying to suck her in Joe's audience they see is like
[54:20.360 --> 54:25.720]  stoner you know low-grade morons that one of one of the ninjas and sure as
[54:25.720 --> 54:29.600]  hell everything I already knew and it wasn't a confirmation bias it was
[54:29.600 --> 54:36.960]  literally like oh he dumped right when it dumped oh he's doing a pump and dump
[54:36.960 --> 54:43.720]  oh and then oh others and I went oh my god I found last night three George
[54:43.720 --> 54:51.280]  Soros own companies that are Joe Rogan sponsors but he almost never tells you
[54:51.280 --> 54:58.160]  it's a sponsor when they're on like the first thing I tell you well because
[54:58.160 --> 55:02.400]  ethically if someone is your parent company or your sponsor when you have
[55:02.400 --> 55:09.320]  them on by the way this is my sponsor doesn't say that in a two-hour podcast I
[55:09.320 --> 55:13.840]  couldn't watch the whole thing so I had a crew member this morning I called it
[55:13.840 --> 55:18.280]  nine I said I watched an hour of it I watched parts of multiple times I can't
[55:18.280 --> 55:22.920]  watch it it's like a snake fest like two cobras dancing together I said can you
[55:22.920 --> 55:29.280]  watch this and no never said Jack thanks for being my sponsor these past few
[55:29.280 --> 55:34.280]  years and paying me hundreds of thousands of dollars a month it was just
[55:34.280 --> 55:38.720]  like thank goodness you're a moral CEO I've never censored anyone on your
[55:38.720 --> 55:45.640]  platform and like Joe's laughing while he says it it's all a it's like saying
[55:45.640 --> 55:52.320]  to Hitler thank God you love Jews or or you know fat Albert thank God you're so
[55:52.320 --> 56:00.080]  skinny or to a giraffe thank God you don't have a neck you know or a bass
[56:00.080 --> 56:07.160]  thank God you have such a small mouth oh my grandma what big eyes you have what
[56:07.160 --> 56:10.760]  big teeth all the better to see you all the better to eat you with and there's
[56:10.760 --> 56:17.280]  Joe man even his own logo was a devil and he's just dancing around it's all
[56:17.280 --> 56:27.920]  funny yeah oh I'm a pothead yeah you want to be manly do with me yeah yeah but
[56:27.920 --> 56:37.200]  the good news is Joe is like the globalist prize pig or something you're
[56:37.200 --> 56:44.560]  like the prize Golden Calf and everyone I know hates his guts
[56:44.560 --> 56:52.280]  even six months ago it's like there's this genetic spiritual awakening where I
[56:52.280 --> 56:56.880]  mean you don't think anybody really lives Alexandria Cortez right that's all
[56:56.880 --> 57:01.640]  fake fake stage election it's the same thing everywhere
[57:05.520 --> 57:10.840]  so I got a bunch of other big news I'm gonna hit but we're gonna go into the
[57:10.840 --> 57:15.280]  Bitcoin scam and I want to be clear I'm not saying a cryptocurrency is bad I'm
[57:15.280 --> 57:20.400]  explaining that it came out of nowhere no one knew it's so avant-garde I had
[57:20.400 --> 57:24.120]  people heavily Soros connected now I realize that trying to get me involved
[57:24.120 --> 57:29.320]  years ago I wouldn't do it they would always just show up when I was in London
[57:29.320 --> 57:35.280]  or wherever try to push on me and now the whole thing's so clear and so Jack
[57:35.280 --> 57:40.600]  Dorsey with Joe Rogan thinks they can sit there and try to sucker people in
[57:40.600 --> 57:48.080]  to another Bitcoin bubble I mean that is diabolical
[57:57.800 --> 58:04.120]  by leaps and by bounds the number one best-selling supplement family in the
[58:04.120 --> 58:08.960]  world is energy drinks and energy supplements but they are riddled with

[1:00:16.900 --> 1:00:18.900]  where
[1:00:18.900 --> 1:00:48.660]  All right, here's what I'm gonna do. I have a ton of really important video clips
[1:00:48.660 --> 1:00:53.020]  I haven't gotten to them and I've also committed to every day take your calls
[1:00:53.020 --> 1:00:57.540]  but then we have like a digital phone system that can take hundreds of calls
[1:00:57.540 --> 1:01:00.580]  at a time so we get like 20 30 on the board and I always feel bad I don't get
[1:01:00.580 --> 1:01:06.340]  the last five or six of you so you know what the answer is guys let's only start
[1:01:06.340 --> 1:01:11.180]  unless I'm doing a whole show of calls let's start taking like 10 and then I'll
[1:01:11.180 --> 1:01:16.460]  get to those for sure let's just do that so we're gonna open the phones up at the
[1:01:16.460 --> 1:01:22.980]  bottom of the hour into the half of the next hour so for a full hour there'll be
[1:01:22.980 --> 1:01:28.180]  a bifurcated hour like the last 30 in the first 30 however you say that
[1:01:29.180 --> 1:01:34.740]  doesn't matter we'll take your phone calls and we will get into any issue you
[1:01:34.740 --> 1:01:40.220]  want any subject anything I mean I have so much news I can't even cover it all
[1:01:40.220 --> 1:01:49.500]  I'm just so blown away by how seedy the system is and just how crazy everything
[1:01:49.500 --> 1:01:57.220]  is and that I can't discipline myself anymore man 15 years ago in radio I
[1:01:57.220 --> 1:02:00.100]  would get a whole show lined up I knew what I was gonna cover I'd get there and
[1:02:00.100 --> 1:02:05.220]  I do it now I say coming up next hour I'm gonna expose a giant Twitter scan that
[1:02:05.220 --> 1:02:09.660]  Jack Norsey's running and then it's like a record skipping or a car accident
[1:02:09.660 --> 1:02:18.140]  sound I start going into it right then it's kind of a good thing there's no
[1:02:18.140 --> 1:02:26.780]  discipline because all there is is discipline you want to me but here's
[1:02:26.780 --> 1:02:31.500]  the problem I do so much preparation and so much research that when it comes time
[1:02:31.500 --> 1:02:42.060]  to do it again it's kind of like your kid had the flu was puking and crapping
[1:02:42.060 --> 1:02:46.460]  all night you took care of them and you feel good you're going to bed about 5
[1:02:46.460 --> 1:02:50.060]  a.m. and maybe they're gonna sleep a few hours but you're about to describe it
[1:02:50.060 --> 1:02:54.300]  to everybody and it's almost like evil describe it and you know I I kind of get
[1:02:54.300 --> 1:02:58.740]  the point like hey man let's watch the football game and have a good time hey
[1:02:58.740 --> 1:03:03.660]  let's not focus on all the evil all day hey man how about Brady six six
[1:03:03.660 --> 1:03:08.060]  Super Bowls in the left wanted to defeat that and they got their ass kicked
[1:03:08.060 --> 1:03:13.940]  and it's archetypal and whoa I start doing that I'm gonna be gone forever
[1:03:13.940 --> 1:03:22.420]  believe me I get off this bicycle I'm gone and I get why people want to be
[1:03:22.420 --> 1:03:32.860]  escapist that's all I want to do now because I can't escape reality and like
[1:03:32.860 --> 1:03:37.620]  I said if these people weren't torturing kids I could and all the other stuff
[1:03:37.620 --> 1:03:44.060]  they're doing I could definitely make a deal but every time I think about even
[1:03:44.060 --> 1:03:50.900]  imagining that my soul jumps about five dimensions higher getting away from hell
[1:03:50.900 --> 1:03:59.340]  going do not do that these people are eternal death and that's what sucks is
[1:03:59.340 --> 1:04:04.580]  they don't want to make a deal they don't want to back off they tell you oh
[1:04:04.580 --> 1:04:09.380]  make a deal be reasonable there's no making a deal with devil worshipers and
[1:04:09.380 --> 1:04:23.220]  child molesters same thing in fact all there is for me now is just shame that I
[1:04:23.220 --> 1:04:28.620]  ever thought it was cool to be in a movie that I sat there in a movie theaters
[1:04:28.620 --> 1:04:32.300]  and watched the credits go up and saw myself in movies and thought it was
[1:04:32.300 --> 1:04:36.580]  cool when that was pure evil or that I ever thought being friends of people
[1:04:36.580 --> 1:04:40.660]  that are from Hollywood school there's none of them that are cool I mean it's
[1:04:40.660 --> 1:04:45.660]  such a liberating feeling though isn't it isn't it folks it's just not want to
[1:04:45.660 --> 1:04:50.980]  we don't even hate them we just don't want to ever talk to them or see them
[1:04:50.980 --> 1:04:55.260]  again the problem is they want to run our lives so they're force-feeding their
[1:04:55.260 --> 1:05:03.180]  psyche at ours aren't they when it comes to rebuilding your energy convenience
[1:05:03.180 --> 1:05:07.020]  is key while coffee candy and other sugary products can give you a short

[1:05:21.500 --> 1:05:24.380]  of energy on the go

[1:09:01.660 --> 1:09:10.660]  Model liquor and a plant from Wales has called the alarm. She said she cried when they broke up. She still plays the record. That's a snake farm.
[1:09:10.660 --> 1:09:19.660]  Snake farm. It just sounds nasty. Snake farm. Pretty much is. Snake farm. It's a reptile. Snake farm.
[1:09:22.660 --> 1:09:27.660]  Alright, the sound we're brought to you by Texas. Alright, let's get serious here.
[1:09:27.660 --> 1:09:33.660]  I'm gonna do this segment and the next and I'm done talking about Joe Rogan for a while because, quite frankly, I got big fish to fry.
[1:09:33.660 --> 1:09:47.660]  But, turns out, with Joe Rogan, he's a stinky little fish, but you can catch Moby Dick with your little Joe Rogan.
[1:09:49.660 --> 1:09:56.660]  And so that's why we're doing this today. I've known Joe 20 years, saw a lot of weird signs, didn't pay attention to his podcast.
[1:09:56.660 --> 1:10:00.660]  My son, six months ago, starts calling him Joe the Snake Rogan.
[1:10:03.660 --> 1:10:09.660]  And he says, yeah, dad, he backhands, attacks you, lies about you, all this stuff constantly because my son was a fan.
[1:10:09.660 --> 1:10:14.660]  And I said, I don't want to hear about it, son. So he started, you tell your son, you don't want to hear about it.
[1:10:14.660 --> 1:10:22.660]  So 6 a.m. a lot of mornings where I'm in there cooking breakfast like I do every day, he comes in, plays me the clip, so I get more and more mad.
[1:10:22.660 --> 1:10:31.660]  And people start saying, you don't know about him running an ayahuasca cult all over the country with government approval and DMT cults that nobody else could do, thousands of attendees per city.
[1:10:31.660 --> 1:10:42.660]  You don't know about all this stuff. You don't know about him and Jack Dorsey and Bitcoin. You don't know about how he's got over 50 sponsors, all big telecoms and big establishment people and everything else.
[1:10:42.660 --> 1:10:50.660]  And I'm like, no, I didn't know that. So I started researching. And let me go over this for you right here.
[1:10:50.660 --> 1:11:00.660]  Let me just start with the fact that he had Jack Dorsey, that psychopathic, slimy little monster on.
[1:11:00.660 --> 1:11:11.660]  And he didn't tell anybody that Jack Dorsey spends millions of dollars a quarter with Joe Rogan.
[1:11:11.660 --> 1:11:17.660]  And we'll get into the companies they push, but they push cryptocurrency bubbles.
[1:11:17.660 --> 1:11:23.660]  The whole two hours is pushing Bitcoin is the global currency. We need a global government.
[1:11:23.660 --> 1:11:30.660]  Never telling you, hey, we're heavily invested in this. Hey, as soon as it hit its market peak, Jack Dorsey dumped it.
[1:11:30.660 --> 1:11:33.660]  This makes Martha Stewart look like an angel.
[1:11:33.660 --> 1:11:42.660]  And not telling you that his cashless system is the number one sponsor on Joe's show for over a year.
[1:11:42.660 --> 1:11:48.660]  That's called unethical on its face. And that's just one of his sponsors.
[1:11:48.660 --> 1:11:57.660]  I started poking around. No wonder he said George Soros cut Hitler's head off and was a huge, you know, Captain America was basically him, even though he was a Nazi.
[1:11:57.660 --> 1:12:02.660]  He's on the payroll. On the payroll, folks.
[1:12:02.660 --> 1:12:13.660]  So about a year and a half ago before Bitcoin plunge, I'd already turned down $100,000, $200,000 a month take on these different Bitcoin companies.
[1:12:13.660 --> 1:12:17.660]  And I wasn't saying crypto itself was bad, but I knew that it had been pushed by the establishment.
[1:12:17.660 --> 1:12:24.660]  It was being put out as this, oh, global currency, but it's anti-establishment to get folks to adopt it.
[1:12:24.660 --> 1:12:28.660]  Only you can get the grassroots to do it. It's acting like it's anti-establishment.
[1:12:28.660 --> 1:12:38.660]  And so I saw that going on and then it reached a million dollars a month that they were ready to pay me these companies.
[1:12:38.660 --> 1:12:44.660]  And I remember talking to family and I said, this is like the tulip bubble, whether it's a real technology or not.
[1:12:44.660 --> 1:12:50.660]  I'm not telling my listeners get involved in something that's offering me a million dollars a month.
[1:12:50.660 --> 1:12:52.660]  That means they're about to dump it.
[1:12:52.660 --> 1:12:59.660]  The fact it's gone from 100,000 a month offer with companies to a million a month means they're pulling their money out in the Ponzi scheme.
[1:12:59.660 --> 1:13:05.660]  They want to bring in all the new suckers with a big advertising push to prop it up so it collapses months later
[1:13:05.660 --> 1:13:11.660]  and they don't get the blame for pulling their money out, which is the crime, when they know it's going down.
[1:13:11.660 --> 1:13:15.660]  It's called a pump and dump.
[1:13:15.660 --> 1:13:22.660]  Now, old Joe likes to giggle with Mr. Darcy and the both of them want to sue me.
[1:13:22.660 --> 1:13:26.660]  Sweetest pie, let's do it because I like that discovery.
[1:13:26.660 --> 1:13:30.660]  But I know Jack Dorsey knows good and damn well what he's doing.
[1:13:30.660 --> 1:13:35.660]  And I looked it up. He dumped it right at its height.
[1:13:35.660 --> 1:13:38.660]  And he says in the video, we'll play in the next segment.
[1:13:38.660 --> 1:13:46.660]  Oh, I talked to the Securities and Exchange Commission about how we should handle this.
[1:13:46.660 --> 1:13:49.660]  They're my good friends. Yes, you give lobbying money to it.
[1:13:49.660 --> 1:13:53.660]  And then what you're saying is like Arthur Anderson let Enron run all those camps.
[1:13:53.660 --> 1:14:02.660]  He even is name dropping in just a five minute clip that, oh, by the way, I'm hanging out with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
[1:14:02.660 --> 1:14:08.660]  I just feel big. Be wearing them top hats like, I say, I say, boy, we taking care of it.
[1:14:08.660 --> 1:14:16.660]  We're going to get all these tens of millions of listeners, all these pothead want to be ninjas on the line to get them some Bitcoin.
[1:14:16.660 --> 1:14:20.660]  We already pumped that sucker up once and drained it before we dropped it on the head.
[1:14:20.660 --> 1:14:26.660]  And these dumbass sucker going to come in for another big old power driver.
[1:14:26.660 --> 1:14:29.660]  I say, I say, I say.
[1:14:29.660 --> 1:14:36.660]  So that's what makes me sick about all this is that I mentioned this yesterday.
[1:14:36.660 --> 1:14:43.660]  The internet was on fire with the fact that his main sponsor is Jack Dorsey's other company, Squared.
[1:14:43.660 --> 1:14:47.660]  And when they thought it was true, they went crazy for years.
[1:14:47.660 --> 1:14:52.660]  He's like, I sure love Squared and I sure love doing my banking with it.
[1:14:52.660 --> 1:14:59.660]  And I love Bitcoin and I think you ought to buy this Bitcoin.
[1:14:59.660 --> 1:15:01.660]  What was it? Floyd Waymother had to pay. What was it?
[1:15:01.660 --> 1:15:03.660]  I didn't look up. I didn't check it this morning.
[1:15:03.660 --> 1:15:05.660]  Was it like $300 something thousand dollars?
[1:15:05.660 --> 1:15:09.660]  All the money he made just mentioning some Bitcoin deal.
[1:15:09.660 --> 1:15:15.660]  He didn't tell you, oh, by the way, I'm getting paid to promote a security.
[1:15:15.660 --> 1:15:23.660]  But see Jack Dorsey and Joe Rogan. Well, it is smart men and you'll not think it up on there.
[1:15:23.660 --> 1:15:26.660]  And they're just like, I love this Bitcoin.
[1:15:26.660 --> 1:15:29.660]  Oh, it's going to go to the sky.
[1:15:29.660 --> 1:15:33.660]  Oh, I love this wireless digital system.
[1:15:33.660 --> 1:15:38.660]  None of them mentioned they own it or that it's a sponsor for them.
[1:15:38.660 --> 1:15:45.660]  Joe's like, I say I declare Jack Dorsey. Have you heard of this here digital system?
[1:15:45.660 --> 1:15:51.660]  Dorsey's like, I think it's the future, baby. Oh, good.
[1:15:51.660 --> 1:16:17.660]  The good news is your listeners hate your guts now dog.

[1:18:57.660 --> 1:19:03.660]  Wars are like 12 round heavyweight boxing championship fights.
[1:19:03.660 --> 1:19:09.660]  It's about who wants it, who's prepared to go the longest and who's ready to do the damage.
[1:19:09.660 --> 1:19:14.660]  We took on Hillary Clinton. We stopped her. We got a national stand.
[1:19:14.660 --> 1:19:18.660]  Nationalists are getting elected all over the world right now. We are winning.
[1:19:18.660 --> 1:19:23.660]  But those of us who are at the very front line at the tip of the spear are under unprecedented attack.
[1:19:23.660 --> 1:19:28.660]  So I'd come to you each day and try to explain to you that this is a war of attrition.
[1:19:28.660 --> 1:19:34.660]  This is about who wants it most and you know the persecution, the censorship, the sponsors, they've taken everything.

[1:20:19.660 --> 1:20:24.660]  Look, I know the supernatural is something that isn't supposed to happen, but it does happen.
[1:20:31.660 --> 1:20:36.660]  From the front lines of the information war is Alex Jones.
[1:20:38.660 --> 1:20:41.660]  I believe it's something that everyone has a right to.
[1:20:41.660 --> 1:20:44.660]  Everyone has a right to, but you still ban people.
[1:20:44.660 --> 1:20:50.660]  Like say like Alex Jones, you guys were the last guys to keep Alex Jones on the platform. You were the last ones.
[1:20:50.660 --> 1:20:54.660]  And I believe you hung in there until he started harassing you personally, right?
[1:20:54.660 --> 1:20:56.660]  No, no, no. He did not.
[1:20:56.660 --> 1:20:58.660]  He came to your house, he banged, no.
[1:20:58.660 --> 1:21:03.660]  He did very different things on our platform versus the others.
[1:21:03.660 --> 1:21:14.660]  So we saw this domino effect over a weekend of one platform banning him and then another and another and another in very, very quick succession.
[1:21:14.660 --> 1:21:23.660]  And people I think would have assumed that we would just have followed suit, but he didn't violate our terms of service.
[1:21:23.660 --> 1:21:36.660]  Right. And afterwards, he did. And we have a policy and if there's a violation, we take enforcement actions.
[1:21:36.660 --> 1:21:42.660]  One might be asking the account holder to delete the tweet, another might be a temper.
[1:21:42.660 --> 1:21:55.660]  Censorship is Twitter's ether. It's like fish swim in the ocean. They're the worst. And it's a giant social engineering AI experiment.
[1:21:55.660 --> 1:22:04.660]  He basically admits that. If you're anti-foot docs in people's houses and saying kill them and bullying and your New York Times board members saying whites are subhumans.
[1:22:04.660 --> 1:22:12.660]  Let's kill, kill them all. You're like, oh, I mean, this is hardcore San Francisco evil.
[1:22:12.660 --> 1:22:21.660]  So he's sitting there, but then says, oh, we don't censor anybody. Everybody deserves to be on social media so we can track you and surveil you and control you.
[1:22:21.660 --> 1:22:26.660]  But Alex Jones was different. There was a domino. We wanted to be different.
[1:22:26.660 --> 1:22:32.660]  Yeah, they were having meetings at their headquarters that came out. They decided to leave them to last. I knew that was coming.
[1:22:32.660 --> 1:22:38.660]  And then Joe's like, yeah, he harassed you. No, we played the clip yesterday. We'll queue it up later.
[1:22:38.660 --> 1:22:48.660]  I said, hey, thanks for saying your pro free speech, but you went on TV and said that I said kill the media with battle rifles. That's not true.
[1:22:48.660 --> 1:22:57.660]  That's bullying. But Joe Rogan's this SJW, even though he's called a UFC guru. He's like, you got bullied too, didn't you?
[1:22:57.660 --> 1:23:03.660]  This big CEO at a hearing and somebody said something to you. You don't.
[1:23:03.660 --> 1:23:13.660]  Oh, no, that's not why. Well, it's not even the reason they give of Oliver Darcy or Dorsey.
[1:23:13.660 --> 1:23:19.660]  It's not even the reason they give dealing with CNN and their reporter claiming that I bullied him.
[1:23:19.660 --> 1:23:27.660]  It's that in the meetings, they said, we're worried about censorship. We've been caught. We're worried Republicans will figure out a discrimination.
[1:23:27.660 --> 1:23:37.660]  Our federal elections, communications violations. We don't know what to do. But since Jones got in the face of Rubio, maybe Republicans won't get mad at us.
[1:23:37.660 --> 1:23:49.660]  That's the weird level psycho stuff of them as if I give a rat's ass about being on your feted fake little bastardized Hollywood scumbag program.
[1:23:49.660 --> 1:23:58.660]  You chicken neck feeble little piece of crap that wants to sell people fake bitcoins and pump and dump operations.
[1:23:58.660 --> 1:24:09.660]  You want to be in California huffing the demonic fumes, even roguing your little stool pigeon, your little footstool. What a joke. God, you're pathetic.
[1:24:09.660 --> 1:24:13.660]  Excuse me. I'm sorry. Let's go back to the club. Here it is.
[1:24:13.660 --> 1:24:17.660]  A temporary suspension. Another might be a permanent suspension.
[1:24:17.660 --> 1:24:21.660]  So what are you saying? Let's hit pause again.
[1:24:21.660 --> 1:24:30.660]  Because he wants you to do your banking on Twitter and he wants you to face scan to access Twitter, face scan to buy and sell for a global government, global currency.
[1:24:30.660 --> 1:24:37.660]  That clip's coming up. So he's going to ban you for life like you're in prison for life. I didn't commit a murder.
[1:24:37.660 --> 1:24:46.660]  No, no, no. I saw Oliver Dorsey or Darcy, not Jack Dorsey, of CNN and said, how dare you be antifreeze speech?
[1:24:46.660 --> 1:24:55.660]  That was bullying a Lord. You see, but oh Joe Rogan, the poor kid from Boston, the one room apartment.
[1:24:55.660 --> 1:25:02.660]  He gets to now be with a CEO and oh, oh, he bullied you, didn't he, John?
[1:25:02.660 --> 1:25:06.660]  Oh, let's talk about it with you right now. Let's continue.
[1:25:06.660 --> 1:25:13.660]  What you're saying is so like, let's use it in terms of like him saying that Sandy Hook was fake. He did not say that on the platform.
[1:25:13.660 --> 1:25:21.660]  Plus again, back it up. So in America, you can't say, hey, they've staged all this other stuff before. So I questioned something.
[1:25:21.660 --> 1:25:27.660]  And then even years later, I say, no, I think that happened. Joe will never say that I said that it happened years ago.
[1:25:27.660 --> 1:25:37.660]  He just repeats the line. So then he says to Jack, well, then what was the offense and Jack can't say what the offense was because it was made up crap.
[1:25:37.660 --> 1:25:44.660]  And he doesn't want to open it up for a lawsuit because he knows we have moles inside his feted organization, which is the hope.
[1:25:44.660 --> 1:25:51.660]  People figure out this is a cult. He's using mind control in his employees. A lot of these SJWs are coming up from air, which is a good thing.
[1:25:51.660 --> 1:25:52.660]  Here it is.
[1:25:52.660 --> 1:25:58.660]  So like let's use it in terms of like him saying that Sandy Hook was fake. He did not say that on the platform.
[1:25:58.660 --> 1:26:01.660]  He did not say that on Twitter. He only said that on his show.
[1:26:01.660 --> 1:26:04.660]  I don't know. I don't know. I don't know all the mediums he said.
[1:26:04.660 --> 1:26:09.660]  What did he do? Hey, pause again. In America, are we allowed to have free speech?
[1:26:09.660 --> 1:26:16.660]  But see now it's this thing where they misrepresent what you said. They never have you on to debate it.
[1:26:16.660 --> 1:26:21.660]  Then they have a straw man and then they make it like, well, did he say it here? Let's continue.
[1:26:21.660 --> 1:26:27.660]  What we're looking at is the is the is a conduct and what he did on our platform.
[1:26:27.660 --> 1:26:32.660]  So what did he do on your platform that was like that you all were in agreement that this is enough?
[1:26:32.660 --> 1:26:36.660]  Hey, pause again. You were all in agreement. This is enough.
[1:26:36.660 --> 1:26:43.660]  Mind control terms from a guy that runs an ayahuasca cult illegally and a DMT cult with huge facilities everywhere,
[1:26:43.660 --> 1:26:47.660]  giant sex parties, everything else is totally illegal beyond any cult you ever imagined.
[1:26:47.660 --> 1:26:51.660]  Just totally out in the open open deal because he's protected.
[1:26:51.660 --> 1:26:54.660]  Notice Joe isn't countering any of this and I'm full of crap.
[1:26:54.660 --> 1:27:00.660]  Oh, the witnesses are on next week if I want them.
[1:27:00.660 --> 1:27:02.660]  Fill your hand, man.
[1:27:02.660 --> 1:27:05.660]  And your gangsters in Vegas.
[1:27:05.660 --> 1:27:07.660]  Think I'm scared of you.
[1:27:07.660 --> 1:27:09.660]  Don't find out, punk.
[1:27:09.660 --> 1:27:14.660]  All your crap runs into a brick wall at some point, doesn't it, son?
[1:27:14.660 --> 1:27:20.660]  Think I'm scared of you and your little, your little gangster buddies in Vegas when I already ran over Hillary.
[1:27:20.660 --> 1:27:30.660]  I was born to run over punks like you.
[1:27:30.660 --> 1:27:36.660]  Always think they got the upper hand until they realized they stuck their arm in the wrong freaking garbage disposal.
[1:27:36.660 --> 1:27:38.660]  Back to him.
[1:27:38.660 --> 1:27:44.660]  I'm not sure what the actual violations were.
[1:27:44.660 --> 1:27:54.660]  But we have a set number of actions and if they keep getting, if an account...
[1:27:54.660 --> 1:28:01.660]  If you don't submit to us, you don't get to go on the cashless program of Twitter, the big global government matrix.
[1:28:01.660 --> 1:28:05.660]  I'll show when we come back where he wants you to face scan to be able to get on Twitter.
[1:28:05.660 --> 1:28:08.660]  And that's the new social score to buy and sell.
[1:28:08.660 --> 1:28:14.660]  He's competing for that to literally be the slave grid in America.
[1:28:14.660 --> 1:28:21.660]  And then he's the number one sponsor of the Joe Rogan toilet bowl experience.
[1:28:21.660 --> 1:28:28.660]  And he doesn't even tell you when he's on and he's pushing Bitcoin pump and dumps.
[1:28:28.660 --> 1:28:33.660]  And his damn cashless society Bitcoin project.
[1:28:33.660 --> 1:28:36.660]  We'll show you those clips when we come back.
[1:28:36.660 --> 1:28:39.660]  How it will, Commander.
[1:28:39.660 --> 1:28:44.660]  So anyways, I'm going to be by myself.
[1:28:44.660 --> 1:28:49.660]  I'm so scared right now.

[1:33:37.660 --> 1:33:54.660]  I'm here to bring you down.
[1:33:54.660 --> 1:33:59.660]  Alright, let me get serious because I'm having some fun here and I need to open the phones up to other important news
[1:33:59.660 --> 1:34:04.660]  and take your phone calls here on this Monday global transmission.
[1:34:04.660 --> 1:34:08.660]  So my listeners are like, why do you like Joe Rogan? He's a total globalist cut.
[1:34:08.660 --> 1:34:13.660]  I've known him 20 years, whatever friends with him, but I didn't pay attention to long-form podcasts.
[1:34:13.660 --> 1:34:23.660]  And then he would do anti-America prosoros talking points and I kind of got in his face about it.
[1:34:23.660 --> 1:34:29.660]  And then I began to research and the fact is he's the globalist cutting edge.
[1:34:29.660 --> 1:34:36.660]  With the dying mainstream media and their whole system, they believe that Joe is their savior.
[1:34:36.660 --> 1:34:42.660]  And so I've laid out here the anatomy. In fact, when we post this letter to different platforms,
[1:34:42.660 --> 1:34:49.660]  we take a few minutes of this segment, put it on front of the sour because I'm just quantifying here
[1:34:49.660 --> 1:34:55.660]  my own awakening to this and seeing what's going on and then like, wait a minute, he keeps plugging this product.
[1:34:55.660 --> 1:35:00.660]  That's Jack Dorsey's company squared and they're not telling people it's Jack Dorsey
[1:35:00.660 --> 1:35:07.660]  and it's Jack Dorsey with Bitcoin and Jack Dorsey that dumped the money right when Bitcoin went down.
[1:35:07.660 --> 1:35:12.660]  Clear insider trading.
[1:35:12.660 --> 1:35:18.660]  Yeah, Bitcoin plunged as Jack Dorsey made available to square users because they were getting all the new general public in
[1:35:18.660 --> 1:35:22.660]  while they were sucking the hundreds of millions and billions out the back door.
[1:35:22.660 --> 1:35:25.660]  I mean, that's even Bloomberg and Forbes.
[1:35:25.660 --> 1:35:30.660]  And then I went back and I was checking like years ago, Joe was promoting all this.
[1:35:30.660 --> 1:35:34.660]  And I'm like, well, I was offered a million dollars a month at one point a year and a half ago,
[1:35:34.660 --> 1:35:39.660]  right when they were already pulling the money out when they really do the advertising to get suckers in
[1:35:39.660 --> 1:35:45.660]  so the globalists get all their money out. You see, wow.
[1:35:45.660 --> 1:35:50.660]  And in my view, Joe knows exactly what he's doing. What a monstrous person.
[1:35:50.660 --> 1:35:56.660]  So he comes out and worships Jack Dorsey.
[1:35:56.660 --> 1:36:02.660]  It blows up in his face. This is as of like a few hours ago. Now it's even more 7000 to 50,000.
[1:36:02.660 --> 1:36:07.660]  That's like eight to one against him.
[1:36:07.660 --> 1:36:12.660]  And again, this isn't bigger than Joe Rogan, but who's Joe Rogan of your regular talk radio listener.
[1:36:12.660 --> 1:36:19.660]  To pothead want to be ninja trendies, he is like Papa Smurf and he is Smurf like, which is okay.
[1:36:19.660 --> 1:36:25.660]  I'm like a giant compared to Joe, but you know, he's a very muscular person for a midget.
[1:36:25.660 --> 1:36:28.660]  But I digress.
[1:36:28.660 --> 1:36:34.660]  Nothing against potheds. The point is, he's like his, his, his, his market.
[1:36:34.660 --> 1:36:42.660]  His market was teach potheds their ninja warlords and get them to take the loose digits.
[1:36:42.660 --> 1:36:49.660]  So that's all unfolded and the comments are 99 to, you know, one against him.
[1:36:49.660 --> 1:36:51.660]  But let's get into the real scam here now to understand the leftist work.
[1:36:51.660 --> 1:36:55.660]  They're all about being trendy, but nothing's more untrained than being a leftist.
[1:36:55.660 --> 1:37:03.660]  Cash app formerly known as Square Cash is a mobile payment service developed by Square Inc.
[1:37:03.660 --> 1:37:12.660]  A lot of users transfer money to one another using a mobile phone app as of February 2018, the service has 7 million users.
[1:37:12.660 --> 1:37:16.660]  And it goes on to say it's owned by Jack Dorsey, owner of Twitter.
[1:37:16.660 --> 1:37:21.660]  Tracking Twitter bots with biometrics.
[1:37:21.660 --> 1:37:23.660]  That's a big news story.
[1:37:23.660 --> 1:37:28.660]  He wants you to face can to get online for your buying and selling, but also just to get on Twitter.
[1:37:28.660 --> 1:37:30.660]  So he wants to nexus it all together.
[1:37:30.660 --> 1:37:36.660]  Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has made a bold prediction about Bitcoin on Joe Rogan's show.
[1:37:36.660 --> 1:37:38.660]  He said it's kind of just surge.
[1:37:38.660 --> 1:37:43.660]  So Bitcoin has gone down 85% in the last year.
[1:37:43.660 --> 1:37:49.660]  There's a graph and it's still going down, but don't worry.
[1:37:49.660 --> 1:37:51.660]  He bought it all right here.
[1:37:51.660 --> 1:37:53.660]  You can bet that's when he bought.
[1:37:53.660 --> 1:37:54.660]  That's what made it go up a little bit.
[1:37:54.660 --> 1:38:00.660]  So Jack, who got out right here, Jack got out at its peak.
[1:38:00.660 --> 1:38:06.660]  That's when Jack got out for jaw.
[1:38:06.660 --> 1:38:10.660]  And then this is where he got back in.
[1:38:10.660 --> 1:38:15.660]  It's a very computer low and the computer saw that it boosted a bit.
[1:38:15.660 --> 1:38:22.660]  And he's going on Joe Rogan show known as sucker plantation, dumbass planet base.
[1:38:22.660 --> 1:38:25.660]  Idiot moron level.
[1:38:25.660 --> 1:38:29.660]  And he says, Oh, it's going to be the biggest thing, the global currency.
[1:38:29.660 --> 1:38:31.660]  It's going to take over.
[1:38:31.660 --> 1:38:35.660]  So they can run it up a little bit before they dump it again.
[1:38:35.660 --> 1:38:37.660]  You'll be so stoned.
[1:38:37.660 --> 1:38:42.660]  You won't even know the Dorsey gets a couple hundred million on your ass.
[1:38:42.660 --> 1:38:50.660]  But after all, he's the trendy with snake farm Joe Rogan snake farm, snake farm.
[1:38:50.660 --> 1:38:58.660]  So let's get to that next clip of them out there pushing Bitcoin as the global currency,
[1:38:58.660 --> 1:39:00.660]  which, you know, they created Bitcoin.
[1:39:00.660 --> 1:39:03.660]  The globalist did that because they knew cryptocurrency was coming.
[1:39:03.660 --> 1:39:04.660]  They wanted to fight it.
[1:39:04.660 --> 1:39:06.660]  They wanted to control it.
[1:39:06.660 --> 1:39:10.660]  They wanted to dominate it, make trillions on its ups and downs, regulators control it.
[1:39:10.660 --> 1:39:14.660]  And then it becomes the global currency when the dollar implodes.
[1:39:14.660 --> 1:39:19.660]  And so here they are not telling you they're heavily invested, not telling you they've got a computer program
[1:39:19.660 --> 1:39:21.660]  that interfaces with the sponsor of the show.
[1:39:21.660 --> 1:39:23.660]  Joe was looking down on the video.
[1:39:23.660 --> 1:39:26.660]  I was like, Oh my gosh, it's incredible.
[1:39:26.660 --> 1:39:29.660]  I love cash app.
[1:39:29.660 --> 1:39:30.660]  It's so amazing.
[1:39:30.660 --> 1:39:31.660]  Square cash.
[1:39:31.660 --> 1:39:33.660]  I just everyone's using it.
[1:39:33.660 --> 1:39:35.660]  Do you know anything about it?
[1:39:35.660 --> 1:39:37.660]  Well, I'm the owner.
[1:39:37.660 --> 1:39:40.660]  I was like, No, I don't think about it.
[1:39:40.660 --> 1:39:41.660]  Oh my God.
[1:39:41.660 --> 1:39:42.660]  It's a trendy.
[1:39:42.660 --> 1:39:44.660]  So let's go and go to this club here.
[1:39:44.660 --> 1:39:53.660]  One of our one of our like equivalent operating principles within cash and square is like under, like, how do we understand someone's struggle?
[1:39:53.660 --> 1:39:54.660]  Like, how do we understand?
[1:39:54.660 --> 1:39:57.660]  How do we have the empathy for what they're struggling with?
[1:39:57.660 --> 1:40:00.660]  And like, when it comes to finance, they're struggling with a lot.
[1:40:00.660 --> 1:40:02.660]  Yeah, typically they're struggling with a ton.
[1:40:02.660 --> 1:40:04.660]  What was the thought process with?
[1:40:04.660 --> 1:40:08.660]  I mean, one of the things that's kind of cool about the cash app is that you can buy and sell Bitcoin with it.
[1:40:08.660 --> 1:40:15.660]  He looks so cool, he has his notes written by Twitter, the parent company of this company.
[1:40:15.660 --> 1:40:17.660]  He doesn't say, by the way, this is my biggest sponsor.
[1:40:17.660 --> 1:40:19.660]  He's like, Oh, it's so cool about it.
[1:40:19.660 --> 1:40:22.660]  It's so cool.
[1:40:22.660 --> 1:40:25.660]  Sorry, let's go back to Joe Rogan.
[1:40:25.660 --> 1:40:26.660]  Yeah.
[1:40:26.660 --> 1:40:30.660]  Are you guys going to consider other forms of cryptocurrency as well?
[1:40:30.660 --> 1:40:32.660]  Not right now.
[1:40:32.660 --> 1:40:36.660]  So back to the internet, I believe the internet will have a native currency.
[1:40:36.660 --> 1:40:37.660]  Really?
[1:40:37.660 --> 1:40:38.660]  It'll have a native currency.
[1:40:38.660 --> 1:40:39.660]  And I don't know if it's Bitcoin.
[1:40:39.660 --> 1:40:46.660]  I think it will because just given all the tests that's been through and the principles behind it, how it was created.
[1:40:46.660 --> 1:40:47.660]  Hit pause again.
[1:40:47.660 --> 1:40:53.660]  The principles, the internet inventive came out of some secret black box.
[1:40:53.660 --> 1:40:55.660]  It's a big thing.
[1:40:55.660 --> 1:41:04.660]  I mean, you know, I got a castle system.
[1:41:04.660 --> 1:41:15.660]  You know, it was something that was born on the internet that was developed on the internet that it was tested on the internet.
[1:41:15.660 --> 1:41:16.660]  Hit pause again.
[1:41:16.660 --> 1:41:18.660]  Like the door put it to make the internet.
[1:41:18.660 --> 1:41:20.660]  Nobody did.
[1:41:20.660 --> 1:41:22.660]  We're not spying on anything.
[1:41:22.660 --> 1:41:24.660]  Come on, let's go back to it.
[1:41:24.660 --> 1:41:25.660]  It is of the internet.
[1:41:25.660 --> 1:41:27.660]  And the reason we...
[1:41:27.660 --> 1:41:29.660]  Oh, oh, oh, sorry.
[1:41:29.660 --> 1:41:44.660]  He's like, oh, oh, Jack Dorsey talks and Joe just because he's getting like 300 grand a month at least.
[1:41:44.660 --> 1:41:48.660]  It's like, oh, oh, oh, sorry.
[1:41:48.660 --> 1:41:49.660]  Family show.
[1:41:49.660 --> 1:41:51.660]  I promised earlier, but I mean, it's really happening.
[1:41:51.660 --> 1:41:52.660]  Let's go back.
[1:41:52.660 --> 1:41:54.660]  It is of the internet.
[1:41:54.660 --> 1:42:07.660]  And the reason we enabled the purchasing of Bitcoin within the cash app is one, we want to learn about the technology and we want to put ourselves out there and take some risk.
[1:42:07.660 --> 1:42:11.660]  We're the first publicly traded company to actually offer it as a service.
[1:42:11.660 --> 1:42:17.660]  We're the first publicly traded company to talk to the SEC about Bitcoin and what that means.
[1:42:17.660 --> 1:42:18.660]  Hit pause again.
[1:42:18.660 --> 1:42:20.660]  It's all serpent talk.
[1:42:20.660 --> 1:42:28.660]  It's the first... I mean, these are guys that train all day to be the slimyest little lizard scums.
[1:42:28.660 --> 1:42:32.660]  They can't just...
[1:42:32.660 --> 1:42:35.660]  An old media they control is like, give us your five-year-olds.
[1:42:35.660 --> 1:42:36.660]  We're going to rape them.
[1:42:36.660 --> 1:42:40.660]  World government Satanism.
[1:42:40.660 --> 1:42:42.660]  We're going to finish up with this and come back.
[1:42:42.660 --> 1:42:49.660]  They say in revelations that the devil's dominated Christians can look at the devil on occasion and say, this is what Venus?
[1:42:49.660 --> 1:42:51.660]  This was the problem?
[1:42:51.660 --> 1:43:20.660]  This Joe Rogan, the snake man?
[1:43:21.660 --> 1:43:34.660]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[1:43:34.660 --> 1:43:36.660]  There's nothing else like it.
[1:43:36.660 --> 1:43:37.660]  You must experience it.
[1:43:37.660 --> 1:43:39.660]  It is a total game changer.
[1:43:39.660 --> 1:43:44.660]  It comes in easy to use, packaged, mixed with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[1:43:44.660 --> 1:43:45.660]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[1:43:45.660 --> 1:43:47.660]  It lasts 10 hours.
[1:43:47.660 --> 1:43:54.660]  So take a half pack at the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[1:43:54.660 --> 1:44:23.660]  This is TurboForce, and in ForzeLive.com.

[1:45:20.660 --> 1:45:23.660]  It's so butt-hurt when Trump won.
[1:45:23.660 --> 1:45:25.660]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[1:45:25.660 --> 1:45:29.660]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[1:45:29.660 --> 1:45:33.660]  And that's why the globalist Hillary and others are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[1:45:33.660 --> 1:45:40.660]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech, about taking your very sovereignty away.
[1:45:40.660 --> 1:45:42.660]  This country is in a war.

[1:46:24.660 --> 1:46:31.660]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter
[1:46:31.660 --> 1:46:39.660]  and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[1:46:39.660 --> 1:46:47.660]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the infowars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people by the local stations you're listening to.
[1:46:47.660 --> 1:46:54.660]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[1:46:54.660 --> 1:47:18.660]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[1:47:18.660 --> 1:47:27.660]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[1:47:27.660 --> 1:47:33.660]  Oh, there's no doubt I align myself with the truth. I'm very honored you're our listeners to put up with me.
[1:47:33.660 --> 1:47:40.660]  But I'm taking care of unfinished business. It's bigger than Jack Dorsey of Twitter. It's bigger than Joe Rogan.
[1:47:40.660 --> 1:47:51.660]  It's a pilgrim's progress of traitorous activity. As a fact that I ignored it even though I kind of halfway knew it was going on, but now I'm going to make good.
[1:47:51.660 --> 1:48:01.660]  Oh, we're, oh, it's deep investigations. So much is about to come out on Jack Dorsey, on Rogan, on all of it. We're going to give you everything here.
[1:48:01.660 --> 1:48:10.660]  And no matter what happens to me, it's all coming out. So all you little nerds think you got a bunch of unconscious slaves you're feeding on.
[1:48:10.660 --> 1:48:16.660]  See how tough you are. You have to see bad boy.
[1:48:16.660 --> 1:48:31.660]  Because I'm so scared. Because everybody knows of all you people. No, I'm scared of God, not you. And so let's say politically, your ribs are going to be broken up bad.
[1:48:31.660 --> 1:48:41.660]  It hurts to breathe with those ribs broken, doesn't it? And I'm just mad. I didn't know about this earlier, but I'm glad I don't know.
[1:48:41.660 --> 1:48:51.660]  So billions of dollars of U.S. citizens have been lost on Bitcoin camps. Hundreds of billions worldwide.
[1:48:51.660 --> 1:48:58.660]  The people that created the pump and the dump. And now Jack Dorsey and Joe Rogan think you're so stupid.
[1:48:58.660 --> 1:49:06.660]  They're back with a great new cash system. You go online and sign up for it with Twitter and then they get you good deals on Bitcoin.
[1:49:06.660 --> 1:49:15.660]  It's coming back. It's the future. Why? It's going to be the new global currency.
[1:49:15.660 --> 1:49:27.660]  And Jack Dorsey's got a face skin, yeah? Before you can even get on Twitter or use your money. So now it's the Chinese social score.
[1:49:27.660 --> 1:49:38.660]  They used to call that the mark of the beast. But here's the good news.
[1:49:38.660 --> 1:49:47.660]  Eight to one people are against this. And so YouTube's come out today and said, let me just show you the article.
[1:49:47.660 --> 1:49:57.660]  Well, I just tell you, you know, if I got a sponsor, I'll tell you it's sponsored. Oh, I love this company, Cash App.
[1:49:57.660 --> 1:50:02.660]  I just love Bitcoin. You're just a big pumper-dumper.
[1:50:02.660 --> 1:50:10.660]  And Floyd Waymother had to pay all his money back for promoting Bitcoin deals, not telling folks he was getting money for it.
[1:50:10.660 --> 1:50:17.660]  It was Joe Joe Rogan while he's sitting in the lap of Jack Dorsey so he can do whatever he wants.
[1:50:17.660 --> 1:50:25.660]  After all Jack Dorsey said, I talked to the SEC. I can do whatever I want.
[1:50:25.660 --> 1:50:29.660]  But see, your listeners can do whatever they want, too.
[1:50:29.660 --> 1:50:39.660]  So see, I'm here telling them what's going on so they can start to investigate Cash App, the equivalent of payday loans online.
[1:50:39.660 --> 1:50:50.660]  Jack Dorsey knows everything in the system that you buy and sell and do in the blockchain because Jack Dorsey's a predator.
[1:50:50.660 --> 1:50:54.660]  And he thinks you're an idiot.
[1:50:54.660 --> 1:51:01.660]  You know, we need, it's not a tyrannical square, but a free open public square, a free square.
[1:51:01.660 --> 1:51:09.660]  Not a neurotic control freak, needle-ding-dong area. That's getting a little off-family, I apologize.
[1:51:09.660 --> 1:51:18.660]  We need to have utilities that aren't a bunch of lying control freaks that say they're not censoring us when they're on all their internal videos and memos,
[1:51:18.660 --> 1:51:25.660]  censoring everybody who is pro-America and we know it.
[1:51:25.660 --> 1:51:35.660]  The only reason he comes out and says, oh, Trump's no better or worse than Obama is because he knows Trump has regulatory power to stop him.
[1:51:35.660 --> 1:51:37.660]  So this has been some unfinished business.
[1:51:37.660 --> 1:51:51.660]  And, you know, I'd exposed Iowaska Cult, DMT Cult, Joe Rogan owning facilities all over the country where they have mass drugging of women and men in separate groups and stuff beyond MK Ultra.
[1:51:51.660 --> 1:51:59.660]  And I just was like, oh my God, I can't believe this is going on. And I was almost like, yeah, why have the witnesses on, you know, the public or slaves, you know, move on.
[1:51:59.660 --> 1:52:09.660]  But then it's like, wait, you're running pumpin' dumps, it looks like, with Jack Dorsey and all this other, it's just like, God almighty, you people are unbelievable.
[1:52:09.660 --> 1:52:19.660]  You want to sit up here and pontificate about me? And, oh, agree, I should be taking off the air? Well, thanks for getting my attention.
[1:52:19.660 --> 1:52:25.660]  Because I didn't do this because you ran around trying to put me under the jail.
[1:52:25.660 --> 1:52:35.660]  I did it because you got my attention. And I started going, whoever's punched me in the nose, I'm like, well, who's that? I'm like, oh, like a blood out.
[1:52:35.660 --> 1:52:51.660]  And then it was over. And now you got me on your tail. See, I'm a nice guy. I'm just kind of going to the forest.
[1:52:51.660 --> 1:53:14.660]  Mine and my own business. Like Bunny Bunny Foo Foo. Wackin' all the filth mice on the head. And then along comes the big bad wolf and tries to bite my, bite me. I'm like, well, big bad wolf.
[1:53:14.660 --> 1:53:22.660]  Then you have to do a Bunny Bunny Foo Foo. It's about a 20 foot tall bunny rabbit with big acid fangs dripping, you know.
[1:53:22.660 --> 1:53:31.660]  The wolf always gets scared when you grab on the tail. It's like, this is going to take long here. And then they always squeal on the way down, but it's okay.
[1:53:31.660 --> 1:53:45.660]  It's all, it's interesting. Listen, it's not till you're in my mouth and I'm chewing on your backbone. It's always right about the middle vertebrae. We're like, oh, oh, yeah.
[1:53:45.660 --> 1:53:59.660]  You're not scamming your poor little listeners anymore now. See, this is, this is, this is karmic enforcement. You're now going into the wood chipper, like, see how it feels. It's fun, fun for you.
[1:53:59.660 --> 1:54:16.660]  Okay, I washed my hands down, at least till the next expose. But man, wow, you talk about Jack Dorsey running a classic pump and dump, not telling people he's pushing products on air and failed securities.
[1:54:16.660 --> 1:54:31.660]  That he obviously sold out of, he admits at the top, bought back into at the bottom and is trying to literally prey on Joe Rogan's poor audience. I mean, God almighty, man. You know, because this is metaphysical.
[1:54:31.660 --> 1:54:46.660]  And I go back to the stuff about all the products we sell and we need your funding right now, use your sport. And I'm like, you know, the thing I'm most proud of is probably the turmeric, the iodine or the fish oil. Because I mean, fish oil is just neutropic heart brain.
[1:54:46.660 --> 1:54:55.660]  If it's clean, best quality like ours for children and adults, it's just insanely good. I mean, there's just, there's nothing like it.
[1:54:55.660 --> 1:55:06.660]  And take it in the morning, give you stamina, take it at night, you sleep better, have better dreams. It's magic. It's amazing what God gave us.
[1:55:06.660 --> 1:55:16.660]  You know, our coffee, even vice-tested and said, oh my God, it's really good coffee. Yeah, it's some of the best Chiapas, basically Guatemala, but it's in southern Mexico. It's amazing, super high quality.
[1:55:16.660 --> 1:55:28.660]  But, but I'm digressing. What I'm getting in here is, is that I already know I'm under attack, plus I want to be really good for you and you want more of it.
[1:55:28.660 --> 1:55:32.660]  Okay, I'm not supposed to do sex analysis because we're a family show.
[1:55:32.660 --> 1:55:50.660]  But the point is, is that I want the products we sell to really be great because that's how I want to be treated. And I want you to reorder them over and over again. So get the turmeric, get the X3 iodine, the missing link, get the fish oil.
[1:55:50.660 --> 1:55:55.660]  And we've got big specials we just launched this week. I keep forgetting to tell you about.
[1:55:55.660 --> 1:56:08.660]  50% off our best selling product, Brainforce Plus, the Neutropic, that dovetails with Turboforce, which is beyond a pre-workout, beyond a day energy event.
[1:56:08.660 --> 1:56:16.660]  I mean, most people have 10 hours of energy, but not zombie cucks. This could, you know, be fatal for them.
[1:56:16.660 --> 1:56:27.660]  50% off Brainforce with purchase of Turboforce, and it's 33% off. So you get a big discount when you get the two together. They're amazing. And it has just, it takes time to get into it all.
[1:56:27.660 --> 1:56:34.660]  But go to research on Turboforce. Go to research on Turboforce.
[1:56:34.660 --> 1:56:47.660]  Because I set out with top firms to have the strongest, purest, best, long burn, healthy energy with the amino acids, with the vitamins, with the minerals, with everything in one package.
[1:56:47.660 --> 1:56:56.660]  Because a lot of folks, you know, you take energy drinks and things, it burns out essential vitamins and minerals in the body to transfer it past the blood-brain barrier.
[1:56:56.660 --> 1:57:01.660]  When you have all this in one spot together, it's game changing.
[1:57:01.660 --> 1:57:05.660]  Like, I never took money for Bitcoin, because I believe it was a pump and dump.
[1:57:05.660 --> 1:57:12.660]  I didn't think the technology itself was a fraud, and I said, more power to you, but I'm not taking money for it, never did.
[1:57:12.660 --> 1:57:26.660]  But I will take your money all day long for Secret 12, incredibly high-quality vitamin B12, or for Turboforce, or for X3, or for any of the products in Force 4.com, because they're the best out there.
[1:57:26.660 --> 1:57:34.660]  They blow everything away. Our fluoride-free toothpaste infused with boiled silver and iodine. Super Blue, it's amazing as well. That's 40% off right now.
[1:57:34.660 --> 1:57:57.660]  Big sales just came back. In Force 4.com, we need your financial support, or we won't be here. Stay with us. We'll be right back. I'll give the number out and take your calls.
[1:58:04.660 --> 1:58:14.660]  Amino acids and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity, and a boost of energy on the go.
[1:58:14.660 --> 1:58:19.660]  Simply take a packet, mix it into the indicated amount of water, and enjoy.
[1:58:19.660 --> 1:58:27.660]  With 14 servings per box for a two-week or more supply, this is the formula to stock up on whenever you need a boost.
[1:58:27.660 --> 1:58:36.660]  Perfect for work, in the car, or at home. Turboforce is the ultimate answer to a sluggish day. Don't let your day slow you down.
[1:58:36.660 --> 1:58:47.660]  Percup with Turboforce at infowarstore.com.
[1:58:47.660 --> 1:59:01.660]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now. InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, left to CIA operatives, the corrupt justice department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[1:59:01.660 --> 1:59:09.660]  People say, why would you start a fight with them? Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground, and I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[1:59:09.660 --> 1:59:19.660]  So we've already had incredible success, but if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target,
[1:59:19.660 --> 1:59:30.660]  and if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos at infowars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scum bags. We'll win.
[1:59:30.660 --> 1:59:40.660]  We have huge sales at infowarsstore.com right now, and we're still able to operate the shopping cart, get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce, and you're right to the market.
[1:59:40.660 --> 2:00:01.660]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Love will stay with you. This is InfoWars Darker Tower. With your support, I'm counting on you.
[2:00:10.660 --> 2:00:15.660]  Alex Jones
[2:00:15.660 --> 2:00:22.660]  Resentment and nostalgia is not the formula for the middle of the country. I can't wait to share that with the rest of America.
[2:00:22.660 --> 2:00:23.660]  Julian Castro
[2:00:23.660 --> 2:00:26.660]  We need universal healthcare so that everybody can have it.
[2:00:26.660 --> 2:00:27.660]  Tulsi Gabbard
[2:00:27.660 --> 2:00:38.660]  My record in Congress over the last six years reflects what is in my heart. A strong and ongoing commitment to fighting for LGBTQ rights.
[2:00:38.660 --> 2:00:40.660]  Corey Booker
[2:00:40.660 --> 2:00:54.660]  And I understand that the penalty comes with potential ousting from the Senate. And if Senator Cornyn believes that I violated Senate rules, I openly invite and accept the consequences of my team releasing that email right now.
[2:00:54.660 --> 2:01:05.660]  And I'm releasing it to expose that, number one, that emails are being withheld from the public have nothing to do with national security.
[2:01:05.660 --> 2:01:11.660]  And I appreciate the comments of my colleagues. This is about the closest I'll probably ever have in my life to an I am Spartacus moment.
[2:01:11.660 --> 2:01:12.660]  Elizabeth Warren
[2:01:12.660 --> 2:01:21.660]  If the question is can we make the Affordable Care Act better and we can find some Republican colleagues to do that? Absolutely. We should do what we can to improve it.
[2:01:21.660 --> 2:01:23.660]  Kirsten Gillibrand
[2:01:23.660 --> 2:01:31.660]  The key issues of her platform are going to make healthcare more equitable as well as education. She says she also wants to fight institutional racism.
[2:01:31.660 --> 2:01:42.660]  The NRA has a chokehold on Congress. The NRA is concerned only with gun sales. It is literally all about money. It is all about greed. It has nothing to do with the Second Amendment.
[2:01:42.660 --> 2:01:43.660]  Kamala Harris
[2:01:43.660 --> 2:02:07.660]  People in power are trying to convince us that the villain in our American story is each other. But that is not our story. That is not who we are. That is not our America.
[2:02:07.660 --> 2:02:15.660]  These are the names in the Democratic field for president and they are all under the impression that they are what's right for America.
[2:02:15.660 --> 2:02:24.660]  After their party wrote a wave of fake news, bullying the American people and its president and backing policies of big government handouts.
[2:02:24.660 --> 2:02:27.660]  Do any of them have the support they claim to have?
[2:02:27.660 --> 2:02:42.660]  Current pseudo frontrunner Democrat Senator Kamala Harris's presidential announcement received less than 100 retweets despite her having a massive following of 2.2 million Twitter users.
[2:02:42.660 --> 2:02:48.660]  From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.
[2:02:48.660 --> 2:02:55.660]  Of course, all of them will have to contend with the shadow of this man. And I'm not just talking about President Trump.
[2:02:55.660 --> 2:03:09.660]  They called me Koon Man. My belief that I did not wear that costume or attend that party stems in part from my clear memory of other mistakes I made in the same period of my life.
[2:03:09.660 --> 2:03:20.660]  That same year, I did participate in a dance contest in San Antonio in which I darkened my face as part of a Michael Jackson costume.
[2:03:20.660 --> 2:03:28.660]  I look back now and regret that I did not understand the harmful legacy of an action like that.
[2:03:28.660 --> 2:03:36.660]  It is because my memory of that episode is so vivid that I truly did not believe I am in the picture in my yearbook.
[2:03:36.660 --> 2:03:46.660]  While outlier Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz is already facing the Democratic mob for potentially dividing the anti-Trump support.
[2:03:46.660 --> 2:03:55.660]  I was a supporter and am a supporter of the Affordable Care Act, which I think can be improved and enhanced so that the premiums come down for families.
[2:03:55.660 --> 2:04:11.660]  How care is a human right?
[2:04:11.660 --> 2:04:22.660]  Perhaps creepy uncle Joe Biden or even National Security Threat Numero Uno Hillary Clinton will ride into the rescue on their platforms of sheer bulls***.
[2:04:22.660 --> 2:04:51.660]  But it's still too early to tell. John Bown reporting.
[2:04:51.660 --> 2:04:56.660]  How dare they be anti-Islamic? What the hell?
[2:04:56.660 --> 2:05:24.660]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements, but they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[2:05:24.660 --> 2:05:33.660]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[2:05:33.660 --> 2:05:43.660]  There's nothing else like it, you must experience it. It is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use, packaged, mixed in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[2:05:43.660 --> 2:05:54.660]  Morning though, it's very, very strong, it lasts 10 hours, so take a half pack at the first time you take it because Turbo Force is named Turbo Force because it will take you into overdrive.
[2:05:54.660 --> 2:06:17.660]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[2:06:17.660 --> 2:06:25.660]  From the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:06:48.660 --> 2:06:54.660]  That really deserves for unborn children and everybody else to get out there.
[2:06:54.660 --> 2:07:09.660]  And only with you getting it out will people see it, so we'll play this report and then go right back to your phone calls and other breaking news and the latest in the Virginia governor and the canard that that idiot, that organ harvester, that's really what this is all about.
[2:07:09.660 --> 2:07:18.660]  They had those, they had those yearbooks on him years ago as blackmail. He got caught admitting they're killing babies after birth, that's why he's got to go.
[2:07:18.660 --> 2:07:25.660]  So the rest of the story on that coming up, but first, John Bounds report, it's on newswars.com and infowars.com, please go get it, get it out.
[2:07:25.660 --> 2:07:31.660]  Satanist, Democrats and Socialists, Cancer on American Morality, here's the report.
[2:07:31.660 --> 2:07:48.660]  Benjamin Franklin prescribed this for our nation back in 1778 saying, whereas true religion and good morals are the only solid foundations of public liberty and happiness, it is hereby earnestly recommended to the several states to take the most effectual measures for the encouragement thereof.
[2:07:48.660 --> 2:08:08.660]  Today we are plagued by a volatile Marxist generation rejecting the founding fathers quest for individual liberty, the idiocy of anti-morality as flared up as a generation of cowards embrace a culture of selfishness that mocks the selflessness of previous American generations while murdering future generations.
[2:08:08.660 --> 2:08:28.660]  So in this particular example, if a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered, the infant would be kept comfortable, the infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.
[2:08:28.660 --> 2:08:31.660]  Do you regret what you said yesterday or the way you said it?
[2:08:31.660 --> 2:08:36.660]  No, I don't. And you know, Alan, I appreciate the question. I'm a physician.
[2:08:36.660 --> 2:08:50.660]  In the midst of this, Northam's racist past is used against not just him, but all of us. A media circus created to distract from the original evil post-birth abortion controversy, a topic the mainstream media won't fully address.
[2:08:50.660 --> 2:09:17.660]  I take credit for recognizing that this was a horrific photo that was on my page with my name Ralph Northam above. I dressed up in a Michael Jackson, excuse me, that's why I have Pam with me. I had the shoes, I had a glove, and I used this a little bit of shoe polish to put under my or on my cheeks.
[2:09:17.660 --> 2:09:22.660]  On January 22nd, New York Governor Cuomo signed the reproductive health...
[2:09:22.660 --> 2:09:35.660]  Yeah, hit pause right there. Back it up five seconds. When you look in Virginia, when they had the debate about killing babies after they were born, these women are licking their lips and getting their skin, they're like,
[2:09:35.660 --> 2:09:52.660]  We don't kill them. And man, you look at Cuomo and them, I mean, they are just like, these are demons, folks, and the devil's just reigning them with satanic delight right now. It's just like, we have the Holy Spirit, they have the devil spirit.
[2:09:52.660 --> 2:10:03.660]  And if you watch them, they say, we don't kill babies after they're born. It's so laborious. It's so good. So let's go back to it. Here it is.
[2:10:03.660 --> 2:10:08.660]  On January 22nd, New York Governor Cuomo signed the reproductive health...
[2:10:08.660 --> 2:10:15.660]  I'm sorry to pause again. Put them back on. Can you imagine being these people?
[2:10:15.660 --> 2:10:33.660]  Because let me tell you, you're talking, especially when it's only a few states doing it, we're talking hundreds of millions of dollars in organs. And this is just like, alright, oh yeah, look at that weirdo lady sitting there, live outfit and all the rest of these people.
[2:10:33.660 --> 2:10:38.660]  I mean, this is just a shake grip of ghouls.
[2:10:38.660 --> 2:10:45.660]  America will never be great and never been great. My name Cuomo.
[2:10:45.660 --> 2:10:58.660]  If you're Christian or gun owner, you're not welcome. White people do not know what like to be poor.
[2:10:58.660 --> 2:11:05.660]  Imagine if you were a jellyfish like these people. Spawn of Satan. And they're always like,
[2:11:05.660 --> 2:11:10.660]  I mean, even if you're going to kill babies after they're born, you should be sawing them about it.
[2:11:10.660 --> 2:11:15.660]  They're like, here, let's go back to it. Here it is.
[2:11:15.660 --> 2:11:21.660]  On January 22nd, New York Governor Cuomo signed the Reproductive Health Care Act.
[2:11:21.660 --> 2:11:27.660]  Back it up 10 seconds. Because to them, it's an affront to God. It's like, we're going to kill these babies. We're going to make money.
[2:11:27.660 --> 2:11:37.660]  Woo! Yeah! Yeah! It's the Governor Cuomo experience.
[2:11:37.660 --> 2:11:39.660]  Sorry, let's go back now.
[2:11:39.660 --> 2:11:47.660]  On January 22nd, New York Governor Cuomo signed the Reproductive Health Care Act into law, which expanded the circumstances.
[2:11:47.660 --> 2:11:52.660]  I'm telling you, that woman, that Satanism writ large.
[2:11:52.660 --> 2:11:59.660]  I mean, if you're a TV viewer, you're seeing it. Regulations can't say this. I mean, these people are...
[2:11:59.660 --> 2:12:06.660]  Well, it's Satanism. Back it up again. You want to see Satanism? Like, they're reveling in the defeat of innocence.
[2:12:06.660 --> 2:12:14.660]  They're reveling in just all of it. This is a ecstasy moment right now. Let's continue.
[2:12:14.660 --> 2:12:24.660]  Satanism can legally obtain an abortion, including up until the moment of birth. And on January 28th, the Virginia legislature introduced a similar bill.
[2:12:24.660 --> 2:12:29.660]  The mainstream media will simply not address the established aborted baby market.
[2:12:29.660 --> 2:12:35.660]  One that Planned Parenthood, which is heavily supported by George Soros, has been actively involved in.
[2:12:35.660 --> 2:12:46.660]  As two of Planned Parenthood's business partners, DaVinci Biosciences and DV Biologics have admitted guilt in a $7.8 million settlement with the Orange County District Attorney
[2:12:46.660 --> 2:12:52.660]  for selling aborted baby body parts from Planned Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino County.
[2:12:52.660 --> 2:12:59.660]  Hey, pause again. That's why they're so pissed. This is just one county. They're selling organs everywhere.
[2:12:59.660 --> 2:13:06.660]  Some people are making $2, $3 million a year as doctors, nurses making $300,000. So they need to get laws passed to keep them alive,
[2:13:06.660 --> 2:13:13.660]  because you want to keep them alive a few days. Mom, like, we kept them alive. They're comfortable, like the good one they said.
[2:13:13.660 --> 2:13:19.660]  And then once that's going on, they can keep them alive until they get that broker and get the price up.
[2:13:19.660 --> 2:13:24.660]  It's got a $300,000, $500,000, $600,000. So see, they need, that's why they're laughing like,
[2:13:24.660 --> 2:13:35.660]  bitches, you think we're going to stop killing kids? Woo! We just legalized child sacrifice. Woo! Yeah, let's go back.
[2:13:35.660 --> 2:13:42.660]  Parts from Planned Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino counties for profit in violation of federal and California law,
[2:13:42.660 --> 2:13:45.660]  as reported by the Center for Medical Progress.
[2:13:45.660 --> 2:13:49.660]  Aborted baby bodies are a very valuable commodity in today's America.
[2:13:49.660 --> 2:13:56.660]  Research institutions, elite universities, medical centers pay a lot of money for baby parts.
[2:13:56.660 --> 2:14:05.660]  I find myself in complete shock saying that on television in America in 2019, but you can buy the arms and legs and skin of babies today.
[2:14:05.660 --> 2:14:13.660]  While Lucian Greaves of the Satanic Temple is giving a soapbox after being the subject of a recent Hollywood documentary praising him.
[2:14:13.660 --> 2:14:20.660]  Well, the first Satanic Temple action that I heard of was definitely the Baphomet campaign in Oklahoma.
[2:14:20.660 --> 2:14:28.660]  When they were fundraising to make this eight-and-a-half foot tall bronze goat-headed deity called Baphomet,
[2:14:28.660 --> 2:14:34.660]  and I thought it was brilliant. Like many people who saw that story and those headlines in that campaign,
[2:14:34.660 --> 2:14:39.660]  you know, was very smile and maybe think, and I thought it was really smart.
[2:14:39.660 --> 2:14:45.660]  Greaves is preaching in a rational fear of Vice President Pence to a generation of swine.
[2:14:45.660 --> 2:14:50.660]  Greaves said, Trump is too stupid to predict the guy has no concept of his own limitations.
[2:14:50.660 --> 2:14:55.660]  The thing that makes me most uncomfortable with Trump is the fact that he has no vision.
[2:14:55.660 --> 2:14:57.660]  Mike Pence really scares me.
[2:14:57.660 --> 2:15:02.660]  Greaves told the Daily Beast, Pence has a clear, theocratic vision for the United States.
[2:15:02.660 --> 2:15:08.660]  How do those themes around Satan and Satanism resonate right now?
[2:15:08.660 --> 2:15:15.660]  For me, it seems kind of obvious that there's been a complete reversal in the roles of who's ostensibly the good guys
[2:15:15.660 --> 2:15:22.660]  and who are the bad guys. Right now, we have evangelical nationalists pushing a theocratic agenda in the United States
[2:15:22.660 --> 2:15:27.660]  and making great headway to take away people's reproductive rights.
[2:15:27.660 --> 2:15:35.660]  The United States is dangerously demoralized when a governor attempts to legalize the murder of living, breathing citizens,
[2:15:35.660 --> 2:15:39.660]  the public is manipulated to support the concerns of the Satanic Temple.
[2:15:39.660 --> 2:15:41.660]  There's no other way but up.
[2:15:41.660 --> 2:15:46.660]  John Bowne reported, please help us in our mission to launch the new renaissance.

[2:16:54.660 --> 2:17:00.660]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[2:17:00.660 --> 2:17:04.660]  I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[2:17:04.660 --> 2:17:10.660]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[2:19:21.660 --> 2:19:31.660]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[2:19:31.660 --> 2:19:40.660]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.

[2:19:58.660 --> 2:20:17.660]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:20:17.660 --> 2:20:26.660]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:26.660 --> 2:20:36.660]  We'll continue with your calls into the next hour. We have a guest host joining us and we've got Dan Lyman popping in with huge developments in Europe in the next seven or older calls right now.
[2:20:36.660 --> 2:20:48.660]  Let's go to Carter in Texas once we talk Joe Rogan and the parent pump and dump he's running for Bitcoin and Jack Dorsey without telling his viewers that they're major sponsors of his.
[2:20:48.660 --> 2:20:53.660]  DMT Colts, Satanic Connection. Carter, thanks for holding your own the year.
[2:20:53.660 --> 2:21:07.660]  Yes, thanks for taking my call Alex. I'd like to ask, what is the relationship between this psychedelic DMT, the Colts we've been talking about, the Satanic Bloodline, the European World Peace, Silicon Valley in China.
[2:21:07.660 --> 2:21:13.660]  I mean, what is the connection between all of these things? I'd really like to get your angle on that.
[2:21:13.660 --> 2:21:31.660]  Carter, yeah, exactly. My angle. I don't have the definitive answer. My angle would be the so-called elites just don't have a conscience or soul or they've lost it and they're constantly taking hardcore drugs to kill their humanity and give them connection to lower energy, lower dimensions.
[2:21:31.660 --> 2:21:46.660]  That's what they believe. Not going off what I believe. If you actually look at that template, the Bible is deadly accurate and so they're trying to hypnotize people and get them under their control for dominion and they're really just fallen individuals.
[2:21:46.660 --> 2:22:00.660]  But Jack Dorsey, the whole San Francisco IT cult is on record being obsessed with drugs and trying to contact interdimensional entities and that's their religion.
[2:22:00.660 --> 2:22:09.660]  Are those interdimensional entities, I mean, are they the Bible or are they the demons that were spoken in the Bible?
[2:22:09.660 --> 2:22:15.660]  Well, absolutely. The Bible has been proven. The Bible has been proven. And by the way, atheism isn't even taught in college now hardly.
[2:22:15.660 --> 2:22:25.660]  All the big billionaires are like, oh, there's other dimensions. We're going to merge with machines. Oh, there's aliens helping us. We're going to merge with them. I'm not into all that. I'm not taking the drugs. I'm not involved.
[2:22:25.660 --> 2:22:33.660]  The point is they believe in that. And so that's what they're doing. I appreciate your call.
[2:22:33.660 --> 2:22:41.660]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jessica. She was talking about the Virginia governor. Jessica, you're on the air. Looks like he'll be resigning soon. What do you think?
[2:22:41.660 --> 2:22:57.660]  I hope so. I never liked him from the beginning. I remember that President Obama endorsed him and that was a big, I thought that would be a big wake up call to people, but apparently it wasn't.
[2:22:57.660 --> 2:23:14.660]  But we keep the babies comfortable. I can't really do his fake Southern accent, but it's just, I love Southerners. I'm from Texas, kind of Southern, but it's like the fakeness of that sickie sweet. Let's stay out of the ladies area and kill that baby.
[2:23:14.660 --> 2:23:28.660]  I think because he's a pediatrician, he's he's used to people, you know, kind of responding to that voice he does, but it thickens me that he's a pediatrician and he's pushing what he's pushing.
[2:23:28.660 --> 2:23:41.660]  But we're going to make the baby comfortable. Oh, my gosh, it's so thickening, but I want to be honest. I don't wish any violence upon him, but I just can't help wanting to get my hands around his neck when he talks.
[2:23:41.660 --> 2:23:50.660]  I completely understand. But I pray for him as I do all these these sick people have been like completely lied to about by the enemy.
[2:23:50.660 --> 2:24:01.660]  No, I agree. But you get though, for the enemy, it's next level for him to like, I don't apologize. We're going to kill the baby. I mean, it's sick.
[2:24:01.660 --> 2:24:14.660]  Well, we know when in times, this is the stuff that happens. That's why I'm so I'm so proud of you and the info wars team for all that you do. And I love I wanted to say I love your products.
[2:24:14.660 --> 2:24:23.660]  I have x2 and the selenium for my thyroid and have to say that it's worked wonders. The brain force plus is amazing.
[2:24:23.660 --> 2:24:32.660]  My family take it every day. And I mean, you really can feel what it does. And usually I get a lot of brain fog from the thyroid issue.
[2:24:32.660 --> 2:24:39.660]  And that helps tremendously in the knockout helps me sleep at night, especially when I have something important, I have to get up and do in the morning.
[2:24:39.660 --> 2:24:43.660]  And I don't feel that groggy feeling. And we use the toothpaste.
[2:24:43.660 --> 2:24:57.660]  We love the toothpaste. My son uses the krill oil for some issues that he deals with my husband is a hardwood floor installer. He loves the body and he loves the red pill plus.
[2:24:57.660 --> 2:25:06.660]  And we're going to try the turbo force next. I really want to get that turbo force with my son loves going to the gym and they need something for a boost.
[2:25:06.660 --> 2:25:15.660]  Well, Jessica, I appreciate your support. But let me be honest with you. I looked at a couple years ago and I said, what's the number one thing in markets we need to fund ourselves with good products.
[2:25:15.660 --> 2:25:26.660]  And all the market research said, pre workout or long lasting energy drink that isn't toxic. So I went to three big developers, I had to pay one of them a lot of money for their formula.
[2:25:26.660 --> 2:25:32.660]  And of course, that won't be connected to us. So I can't say it on air, but it's one of the top manufacturers in the country.
[2:25:32.660 --> 2:25:45.660]  They said, okay, if people spent money and actually put money in the product, this is what we tell the top energy drink in the country that we make, which has half the product you have in yours, and we're selling it for the same price.
[2:25:45.660 --> 2:25:54.660]  So when I tell you turbo force only take a half pack at the first time, because I mean, I mean, my sister took it and she's already in great shape. She's like 15 years younger than me.
[2:25:54.660 --> 2:26:04.660]  She took it and 10 hours later was bouncing off the wall. So it's very powerful. I'm not saying I'm embarrassed to put this out because it's overall I think it's good for you.
[2:26:04.660 --> 2:26:18.660]  And like you said, get in the gym energy business. It's just, it's kind of like good crack. So I'm almost embarrassed. Everybody should be careful with it. It's the next level. It's insane.
[2:26:18.660 --> 2:26:36.660]  I really am glad that I'm able to help the fight for truth and freedom and liberty. And I don't know what where I would be and what I would think if I didn't have people like you want air to have just stayed strong through it also.
[2:26:36.660 --> 2:26:50.660]  I just want to encourage you just to keep going, keep fighting for us and with us because I don't know. I don't know what we would do. We wouldn't have anybody if there wasn't you. I mean, I don't know that anybody else would be on the air doing it.
[2:26:50.660 --> 2:27:06.660]  Like you said, you're the tip of the spear. So I really appreciate you and what you say, you know, helps me stay connected to the truth. It helps me stay connected to God. And I can't say enough about how much I love Info Wars, how much I love the products.
[2:27:06.660 --> 2:27:11.660]  But I would like to have some female cut shirts, some more options.
[2:27:11.660 --> 2:27:21.660]  No, no, I totally agree. We put out the one gold foil female shirt. It was a big head and we're just brain dead. But I promise that's our number one complaint. This from women.
[2:27:21.660 --> 2:27:34.660]  We only got a couple shirts that are cut for females. We will get it done for you. But Jessica, you give me strength to go on and your husband and your family, because just hearing what's in your voice, the powerful feminine energy and then the male energy together.
[2:27:34.660 --> 2:27:43.660]  All of us focused together against the globalist is unstoppable. And that's why they're attacking that sacred system of the family of all of us together.
[2:27:43.660 --> 2:27:50.660]  We are humanity. We are the experience. We are everything. And so you just got my commitment to fight on. But let me tell you, I'm obnoxious.
[2:27:50.660 --> 2:27:58.660]  Most of the time I'm burnout hearing you. I want to just say this. I'm not just telling you this. You are the Info War. You're the power of the whole thing.
[2:27:58.660 --> 2:28:07.660]  That's why I get so freaked out about begging the audience for help, because it's the truth. I mean, I'm not just saying it. If you weren't here, it's obvious, but it's so real.
[2:28:07.660 --> 2:28:15.660]  If you weren't here standing in the way, they would have already destroyed me. But we're in this together. So God bless you, Jessica, from Virginia.
[2:28:15.660 --> 2:28:24.660]  And yeah, looking at that little pathetic Gremlin governor and his little, of course, he's KKK. Who do you think, who the hell wants to harvest baby's organs?
[2:28:24.660 --> 2:28:31.660]  That's what that's all really about. These are demons. But thanks to you and others, we're going to win. Thank you so much.
[2:28:31.660 --> 2:28:40.660]  Wow. Powerful call. Powerful. All right. We got Dan Lyman popping in for like a segment or two, but I'm going to continue the next hour.
[2:28:40.660 --> 2:28:55.660]  I'm not having a special guest show in the office, and Drill Salente is about to take over. I'm going to get all the callers, Paul and others when we come back. Stay with us.
[2:29:10.660 --> 2:29:17.660]  Using prescription drugs. After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from me.
[2:29:17.660 --> 2:29:26.660]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth. I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't. It hit me when I was arrested.
[2:29:26.660 --> 2:29:41.660]  Get sober now. Your private insurance may cover costs and we'll get you here. It's simple. Just call Elite Rehab Placement right now, please. Don't wait. Your life matters to us.
[2:29:41.660 --> 2:30:05.660]  Call right now before it's too late. 800-213-9264.
[2:30:05.660 --> 2:30:14.660]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[2:30:14.660 --> 2:30:24.660]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.

[2:33:36.660 --> 2:33:44.660]  And I've got Dan Lyman, EuropeWars.com's great editor-in-chief joining us because there's so much news.
[2:33:44.660 --> 2:33:54.660]  Sharia Laws here, they're swimming pools across the country, have whole days that are closed so the Muslims can have people wear burkinis.
[2:33:54.660 --> 2:33:57.660]  We've got school lunches having to be halal.
[2:33:57.660 --> 2:34:04.660]  And now, Muslim Patrol Group in New York faces backlash, including far-right conspiracy theorists.
[2:34:04.660 --> 2:34:10.660]  So, your conspiracy theorist that it says Muslim Community Patrol and looks just like a police car.
[2:34:10.660 --> 2:34:13.660]  Scroll down so TV viewers can see it.
[2:34:13.660 --> 2:34:16.660]  New York Muslims have a new security patrol.
[2:34:16.660 --> 2:34:19.660]  I'm sorry, this is getting more and more insane.
[2:34:19.660 --> 2:34:25.660]  Meanwhile, Austria, white girls wearing headscarves to prevent harassment from Muslim migrants.
[2:34:25.660 --> 2:34:29.660]  That's all up on Infowars.com and PresidentPlanet.com.
[2:34:29.660 --> 2:34:31.660]  We're going to go to Dan Lyman of EuropeWars.com.
[2:34:31.660 --> 2:34:36.660]  Just a moment, but going back to the calls real fast, Frank in North Carolina will go to you in a moment.
[2:34:36.660 --> 2:34:38.660]  First, Paul in New Jersey.
[2:34:38.660 --> 2:34:43.660]  Paul, I went on a Jag today about Joe Rogan and Jack Dorsey because Jack Dorsey is the biggest sponsor,
[2:34:43.660 --> 2:34:47.660]  pays for all the Bitcoin, pump and dumping, all the products they promote.
[2:34:47.660 --> 2:34:52.660]  They don't even tell you when they're on there promoting it that Jack Dorsey owns it.
[2:34:52.660 --> 2:34:53.660]  Very unethical.
[2:34:53.660 --> 2:34:56.660]  I think it's securities and exchange commission violation.
[2:34:56.660 --> 2:34:57.660]  Go ahead.
[2:34:57.660 --> 2:35:00.660]  Oh, you're getting me started going here, but I want to start with Alex.
[2:35:00.660 --> 2:35:04.660]  I'm a big fan and I just want to say what a class operation you run.
[2:35:04.660 --> 2:35:08.660]  The guy on the phone couldn't have been a better gentleman. This is my first time pulling.
[2:35:08.660 --> 2:35:11.660]  I've been listening since 2013.
[2:35:11.660 --> 2:35:14.660]  I mean, where do we start with Joe Rogan?
[2:35:14.660 --> 2:35:15.660]  I'll tell you something.
[2:35:15.660 --> 2:35:19.660]  My father, my father integrated here in 51 from Warthorne, Germany.
[2:35:19.660 --> 2:35:22.660]  I was in his hip pocket my whole life.
[2:35:22.660 --> 2:35:24.660]  Listen, everything he said.
[2:35:24.660 --> 2:35:26.660]  Tough guy, Vietnam vet.
[2:35:26.660 --> 2:35:28.660]  He always warned me of guys like Joe Rogan.
[2:35:28.660 --> 2:35:30.660]  He called him Chameleons.
[2:35:30.660 --> 2:35:35.660]  Not necessarily every kid that's bullied is a bad kid or whatever,
[2:35:35.660 --> 2:35:40.660]  but it's so more common than these kids.
[2:35:40.660 --> 2:35:42.660]  No, you're right. Joe is a chameleon.
[2:35:42.660 --> 2:35:45.660]  He's whatever you want him to be, but he's a predator.
[2:35:45.660 --> 2:35:47.660]  Exactly. Exactly.
[2:35:47.660 --> 2:35:49.660]  I mean, he talks about bullying.
[2:35:49.660 --> 2:35:50.660]  I was bullied.
[2:35:50.660 --> 2:35:57.660]  My family, I mean, whatever godless people took care of that kid as a child,
[2:35:57.660 --> 2:36:01.660]  but took them all over the country or hippies, whatever he claims they were.
[2:36:01.660 --> 2:36:05.660]  But I mean, you look at, he talks about bullying.
[2:36:05.660 --> 2:36:09.660]  This guy made his comedic bones by bullying Carlos Mencia.
[2:36:09.660 --> 2:36:11.660]  Now I'm not a fan of Carlos Mencia.
[2:36:11.660 --> 2:36:17.660]  No, but Joe takes everybody else's content and he claims other people are like Dennis Leary.
[2:36:17.660 --> 2:36:18.660]  Exactly.
[2:36:18.660 --> 2:36:21.660]  I mean, it's easy to say somebody's a fraud.
[2:36:21.660 --> 2:36:24.660]  It's just a real quick general word, blah, blah, blah.
[2:36:24.660 --> 2:36:31.660]  But I mean, I've actually studied Rogan now and my first episode I ever watched was 9-11 with you.
[2:36:31.660 --> 2:36:35.660]  And I'm not saying it changed my life, but let me tell you something.
[2:36:35.660 --> 2:36:42.660]  I was woke up and after that episode, slowly the process of him picking you apart,
[2:36:42.660 --> 2:36:46.660]  guest by guest, was just unbelievable.
[2:36:46.660 --> 2:36:48.660]  And then he's saying, we're friends.
[2:36:48.660 --> 2:36:50.660]  I love Alex. He's a great guy.
[2:36:50.660 --> 2:36:57.660]  I mean, how, I don't even understand, but then I hear today you're saying he's making 300,000 a month from Jack Dorsey,
[2:36:57.660 --> 2:37:01.660]  that godless, soulless, whatever that guy is.
[2:37:01.660 --> 2:37:07.660]  But now it makes sense because power corrupts and absolute power corrupts, absolutely.
[2:37:07.660 --> 2:37:11.660]  So with that kind of money, I mean, it's up for grabs, Joe.
[2:37:11.660 --> 2:37:14.660]  I mean, I'm sorry, Alex, I apologize.
[2:37:14.660 --> 2:37:17.660]  Now, as you're talking about Joe, and that's the thing, I don't want to just sit here and attack Joe,
[2:37:17.660 --> 2:37:20.660]  but I'm not going to sit here and say, looks like a pump and dump, looks like a scam.
[2:37:20.660 --> 2:37:23.660]  Oh, but I love Joe. No, I don't love Joe.
[2:37:23.660 --> 2:37:28.660]  I mean, in fact, I'm mad that I was like, not paying attention and realize what a monster he is.
[2:37:28.660 --> 2:37:30.660]  Now he prays on his audience.
[2:37:30.660 --> 2:37:32.660]  You know, if I'm selling a product, I tell you what it is.
[2:37:32.660 --> 2:37:38.660]  His whole show, the shirts he wears, the drinks he has, everything he does.
[2:37:38.660 --> 2:37:42.660]  And then he, oh, but he's not selling nothing to nobody.
[2:37:42.660 --> 2:37:49.660]  And he's up there promoting securities without telling people that his sponsor is the pusher of the securities.
[2:37:49.660 --> 2:37:51.660]  That's illegal, period.
[2:37:51.660 --> 2:37:54.660]  But again, he's protected.
[2:37:54.660 --> 2:37:59.660]  Exactly. Hey, his whole career was brought up against censorship.
[2:37:59.660 --> 2:38:04.660]  We can't censor this. His favorite comedians, Kinnison, Hicks, George Carlin.
[2:38:04.660 --> 2:38:09.660]  I mean, you want to talk about guys that if they had the censorship today, we've never would have heard it.
[2:38:09.660 --> 2:38:13.660]  Well, here's what happens. A fish rots from the head and things go quick.
[2:38:13.660 --> 2:38:18.660]  I might have been blind 10 years ago. He was already bad, but it's just now it's a race to the bottom.
[2:38:18.660 --> 2:38:25.660]  As soon as he went along with everybody else being the platform, as soon as he went along on YouTube, you go to YouTube under CNN.
[2:38:25.660 --> 2:38:28.660]  It's Joe Rogan. That's, that's who they are.
[2:38:28.660 --> 2:38:33.660]  So he rolled over, presented his rear end to him and our rear end at the same time.
[2:38:33.660 --> 2:38:43.660]  I was letting the guy know that, look, I'm pleasantly excited and surprised by suddenly all his videos are 80% negative.
[2:38:43.660 --> 2:38:45.660]  Everybody hates him now.
[2:38:45.660 --> 2:38:50.660]  My audience was pissed at me for not attacking him because I wasn't paying attention to him.
[2:38:50.660 --> 2:38:55.660]  And how am I suddenly like six months ago said, Joe, the snake Rogan, you really got to listen to this dad.
[2:38:55.660 --> 2:38:59.660]  And I said, okay, and I started listening to what you're talking about. God bless you, Paul.
[2:38:59.660 --> 2:39:06.660]  And again, I don't care if somebody has a big giant podcaster on here. I hope Joe's successful.
[2:39:06.660 --> 2:39:12.660]  But I'm not going to let him do it in America or anybody else's expense.
[2:39:12.660 --> 2:39:16.660]  And that's exactly, he's beyond a snake.
[2:39:16.660 --> 2:39:19.660]  He's a lizard. He's a chameleon.
[2:39:19.660 --> 2:39:25.660]  He's a shape shifter. I don't mean literally, but just everything he does is for this cast or that guest.
[2:39:25.660 --> 2:39:29.660]  But now it's not even, oh, when a conservative is on, I'm a conservative.
[2:39:29.660 --> 2:39:31.660]  When a liberal is on, I'm a liberal.
[2:39:31.660 --> 2:39:35.660]  No, now it's just pure corporate crap.
[2:39:35.660 --> 2:39:39.660]  So I went and looked up last night a list of his sponsors that he doesn't put on the site, but you can find.
[2:39:39.660 --> 2:39:47.660]  And I watched the podcast and I was like, my God, everything he says is a scripted ad.
[2:39:47.660 --> 2:39:52.660]  Worked in. Oh, I love this product I heard of. Jack, tell me.
[2:39:52.660 --> 2:39:57.660]  Oh, yeah, it's real good. They don't even tell you he's the owner of it.
[2:39:57.660 --> 2:40:00.660]  And the whole show's about where you're going to break it back with Dan Lyman.
[2:40:00.660 --> 2:40:10.660]  And I'll take a little bit of the time for Salente to go to Frank and Jeff and James and Andrew and Anthony and a few others that are holding.
[2:40:10.660 --> 2:40:13.660]  Speaking of sponsorship, you heard some of the other callers.
[2:40:13.660 --> 2:40:16.660]  When callers calling in plug stuff, we sell a lot of product.
[2:40:16.660 --> 2:40:21.660]  We have third party review site like Power Reviews.
[2:40:21.660 --> 2:40:26.660]  And they even had BuzzFeed try to harass them and say, oh, the reviews are fake as if I've got time or energy.
[2:40:26.660 --> 2:40:28.660]  I don't know how the hell to do that.
[2:40:28.660 --> 2:40:31.660]  No, we really have 98% reviews.
[2:40:31.660 --> 2:40:39.660]  We really have products that are incredible because I go to top facilities and I say, I want the best fish oil you got.
[2:40:39.660 --> 2:40:41.660]  What's the top company in the U.S.?
[2:40:41.660 --> 2:40:45.660]  Because the companies never own their manufacturing facilities. They always contract out.
[2:40:45.660 --> 2:40:51.660]  And they go, okay, this is the top company's putting $3 in each bottle.
[2:40:51.660 --> 2:40:54.660]  And I go, excuse me? Why?
[2:40:54.660 --> 2:41:01.660]  Well, they don't take all the mercury out and they leave in some of the other microscopic pieces of the fish and the krill.
[2:41:01.660 --> 2:41:07.660]  And yeah, the strongest stuff is $5 bottle and then markup and everything.
[2:41:07.660 --> 2:41:12.660]  And I'm like, okay, well, let's put $10 in the bottle.
[2:41:12.660 --> 2:41:14.660]  Can you do that?
[2:41:14.660 --> 2:41:17.660]  And they said, yeah, we can actually do that.
[2:41:17.660 --> 2:41:23.660]  Then I have it tested by another firm because I want you to get the insane level.
[2:41:23.660 --> 2:41:25.660]  See, I want that karma.
[2:41:25.660 --> 2:41:27.660]  I don't believe in the whole Hindu karma thing, but you know what I mean?
[2:41:27.660 --> 2:41:29.660]  Reputs you so it's the best.
[2:41:29.660 --> 2:41:31.660]  It's what my children take.
[2:41:31.660 --> 2:41:32.660]  It's what I take.
[2:41:32.660 --> 2:41:34.660]  Let me tell you something.
[2:41:34.660 --> 2:41:39.660]  Take Brain Force Plus, but be careful because you don't want to take a 10 hours free.
[2:41:39.660 --> 2:41:40.660]  You're supposed to go to sleep.
[2:41:40.660 --> 2:41:44.660]  Take the new trumpet that goes with it, Brain Force, see how clean and great it is.
[2:41:44.660 --> 2:41:48.660]  See ultimate brown broth, new sale, 50% off.
[2:41:48.660 --> 2:41:50.660]  We just got more of an end.
[2:41:50.660 --> 2:41:56.660]  Each little scoop is the equivalent of an incredible amount of chicken noodle soup without calories.
[2:41:56.660 --> 2:41:58.660]  And it's got the chaga mushroom.
[2:41:58.660 --> 2:42:00.660]  It's got the bee pollen.
[2:42:00.660 --> 2:42:08.660]  Well, that's not a good seller for it, but yeah, vice did a whole hit piece going, uh, I mixed it with water and he barely mixes it like he's,
[2:42:08.660 --> 2:42:10.660]  he really feels sorry for him.
[2:42:10.660 --> 2:42:12.660]  I mean, it might be from the Special Olympics.
[2:42:12.660 --> 2:42:16.660]  I mean, this guy's like the Special Olympics, the Special Olympics.
[2:42:16.660 --> 2:42:19.660]  Yeah, it's, it's, it's like holy water for vampires.

[2:42:29.660 --> 2:42:32.660]  97% bad votes.
[2:42:32.660 --> 2:42:40.660]  Standing with Joe Rogan now, everything they do turns to crap, and that's what makes me feel positive is that everything these globalist pushes blow up their face.

[2:44:09.660 --> 2:44:10.660]  We got a nationalist in.
[2:44:10.660 --> 2:44:13.660]  Nationalists are getting elected all over the world right now.

[2:47:35.660 --> 2:47:36.660]  All right Dan Lyman.
[2:47:36.660 --> 2:47:40.660]  I love to pop in at least once a week from EuropeWars.com.
[2:47:40.660 --> 2:47:42.660]  Subsidiary of the operations here.
[2:47:42.660 --> 2:47:46.660]  And there is so much insanity reviewing the last few days of news.
[2:47:46.660 --> 2:47:47.660]  The yellow vest.
[2:47:47.660 --> 2:47:54.320]  Police caught targeting them, the video, Muslim patrols, mass rapes, women having to wear
[2:47:54.320 --> 2:47:59.100]  hijabs, not to be raped in Germany, Dan Lyman of EuropeWars.com, thank you for joining us
[2:47:59.100 --> 2:48:01.740]  to give us the latest update.
[2:48:01.740 --> 2:48:02.980]  Great to be back with you, Alex.
[2:48:02.980 --> 2:48:06.380]  We'll start rolling, Mike and Padre, there's a lot here.
[2:48:06.380 --> 2:48:10.060]  Gosh, there is such a lot, and you know, there's so much going on in the U.S. too.
[2:48:10.060 --> 2:48:15.420]  Today is one of those days where you really feel the quickening, and just covering the
[2:48:15.420 --> 2:48:19.740]  waterfront today, just what's going on in Europe, and how it ties into what's going
[2:48:19.740 --> 2:48:22.460]  on in the United States is just incredible.
[2:48:22.460 --> 2:48:24.180]  But I mean, there's so much.
[2:48:24.180 --> 2:48:27.980]  But as you mentioned, we have the Islamic patrols here in New York City, they're just
[2:48:27.980 --> 2:48:29.180]  kicking off.
[2:48:29.180 --> 2:48:35.340]  And then you have in the U.K. in Birmingham, we have a Muslim school where girls are not
[2:48:35.340 --> 2:48:40.020]  allowed to eat until the boys have eaten, and they have already been found to be in violation
[2:48:40.020 --> 2:48:43.980]  of segregation rules in the U.K. in 2017.
[2:48:43.980 --> 2:48:45.420]  They're still in operation.
[2:48:45.420 --> 2:48:48.820]  I just kind of want to fly through a couple things here, just cover the waterfront, because
[2:48:48.820 --> 2:48:51.060]  it's just so much to look at.
[2:48:51.060 --> 2:48:55.780]  A great reporter out of Sweden, Peter Sweden, he just does a great job of tracking what's
[2:48:55.780 --> 2:48:56.780]  going on there.
[2:48:56.780 --> 2:49:03.020]  He just put together the crime statistics that have been all compiled from 2017 and 2018,
[2:49:03.020 --> 2:49:05.780]  and just itemized them for Sweden.
[2:49:05.780 --> 2:49:11.340]  7,840 rapes in Sweden last year, with half of them being children.
[2:49:11.340 --> 2:49:15.940]  And that's important because this goes to also what's going on with the abortion situation
[2:49:15.940 --> 2:49:17.380]  in the United States.
[2:49:17.380 --> 2:49:22.980]  So often it comes down to the children, and the children are either left, you know, on
[2:49:22.980 --> 2:49:28.340]  their own, undefended in many ways, whether it is abortion or it's these situations with
[2:49:28.340 --> 2:49:33.180]  the migrants, or they are actively put into these situations by people who should be taken
[2:49:33.180 --> 2:49:34.180]  care of them.
[2:49:34.180 --> 2:49:37.820]  And you just flashed the Info Wars Europe screen, I just did a story over the weekend
[2:49:37.820 --> 2:49:43.420]  about migrants being banned from visiting schools and daycares in a small Finnish city
[2:49:43.420 --> 2:49:45.100]  up near the Arctic Circle.
[2:49:45.100 --> 2:49:49.980]  The reason that's interesting is because in Ulu Finland right now, they have an explosive
[2:49:49.980 --> 2:49:53.940]  grooming gang crisis that just started to break at the end of last year.
[2:49:53.940 --> 2:49:59.700]  And now they're up to a dozen, if not 15 cases, they're investigating all involving girls
[2:49:59.700 --> 2:50:05.300]  under the age of 15, some as young as 10, and all of them involving migrant men who
[2:50:05.300 --> 2:50:09.140]  either gang rape them or rape them over a period of months.
[2:50:09.140 --> 2:50:10.140]  And it's just crazy.
[2:50:10.140 --> 2:50:16.420]  And I was wondering, why would migrant men be visiting daycares and schools in this little
[2:50:16.420 --> 2:50:17.780]  city in Finland?
[2:50:17.780 --> 2:50:23.060]  And it turns out there is an EU funded project called the Esikoto project, which invites
[2:50:23.060 --> 2:50:28.860]  asylum seekers quote unquote, to visit schools with that where the children go as part of
[2:50:28.860 --> 2:50:34.180]  the integration program, which sure, that's just like in Germany and Sweden and in England,
[2:50:34.180 --> 2:50:39.260]  they make kids twice a year, not go to a Christian church, not a Catholic church, no, or Orthodox
[2:50:39.260 --> 2:50:43.180]  church or a Protestant church, they make you go to a mosque.
[2:50:43.180 --> 2:50:47.500]  Yes, and they're also bringing the mosque to them effectively.
[2:50:47.500 --> 2:50:52.780]  And this reminded me at the end of last year, December, just a couple months ago, there
[2:50:52.780 --> 2:50:58.380]  was a huge scandal that kind of quietly broke in Poland, where there were migrant men who
[2:50:58.380 --> 2:51:05.060]  were being brought to Polish a camp called Euro week camp, which involved a lot of teenage
[2:51:05.060 --> 2:51:07.300]  to very young adults.
[2:51:07.300 --> 2:51:12.380]  And a lot of the girls were being harassed by the migrant men who they had brought in
[2:51:12.380 --> 2:51:16.820]  a lot of them got their phone numbers somehow from these very impressionable young girls
[2:51:16.820 --> 2:51:19.740]  and we're sending them horrific text messages.
[2:51:19.740 --> 2:51:24.260]  They were all these pictures of the migrant men at the camp, you know, grown men, maybe
[2:51:24.260 --> 2:51:29.940]  20, 30 years old, and they're all over these very, very young, 12, 13 year old Polish girls
[2:51:29.940 --> 2:51:31.740]  kissing them, hugging them.
[2:51:31.740 --> 2:51:33.340]  And so that was a little a scandal that broke out.
[2:51:33.340 --> 2:51:39.100]  We have all the famous footage of women being mass raped at these quote, anti racism events
[2:51:39.100 --> 2:51:40.100]  in Sweden and Germany.
[2:51:40.100 --> 2:51:44.580]  I mean, we're talking like 50 men on YouTube gang raping women.
[2:51:44.580 --> 2:51:45.580]  Yes.
[2:51:45.580 --> 2:51:49.820]  And, and they don't care how old the women are, they'll, they'll go for 10 year old
[2:51:49.820 --> 2:51:52.300]  girls or 85 year old women.
[2:51:52.300 --> 2:51:57.060]  There is no discretion used by these people to just, they're just, it's all out warfare
[2:51:57.060 --> 2:51:58.260]  on women.
[2:51:58.260 --> 2:52:01.220]  And I'm not saying that they all do that, of course, but there's just way too much
[2:52:01.220 --> 2:52:02.220]  to say.
[2:52:02.220 --> 2:52:03.220]  The West doesn't do this.
[2:52:03.220 --> 2:52:04.460]  We're the ones that stopped it.
[2:52:04.460 --> 2:52:06.020]  And I'm sick of being blamed with it.
[2:52:06.020 --> 2:52:09.580]  Every time I see these videos of women being drugged and gang raped, I get really angry.
[2:52:09.580 --> 2:52:11.900]  What the hell's going on, Dan?
[2:52:11.900 --> 2:52:13.460]  These make me really angry as well.
[2:52:13.460 --> 2:52:17.180]  And I think you can tie this in as always leftists that are for this.
[2:52:17.180 --> 2:52:20.260]  Leftists are fine with killing a baby right after it's come out of the womb.
[2:52:20.260 --> 2:52:24.660]  They're also fine with sticking your 10 year old daughter with a few migrant men from who
[2:52:24.660 --> 2:52:27.420]  knows where, with what note, who knows what values.
[2:52:27.420 --> 2:52:31.260]  I wouldn't be okay with my 10 year old girl with, with 10 guys from Sweden.
[2:52:31.260 --> 2:52:36.620]  I mean, the bottom line is this is just bizarre, like sacrificing of children at the altar
[2:52:36.620 --> 2:52:39.500]  of multiculturalism or abortion or whatever.
[2:52:39.500 --> 2:52:44.300]  And I think the mask is off right now and, and everyone needs to get involved, speak
[2:52:44.300 --> 2:52:48.740]  up, make your voice heard, whether it's on social media or at the dinner table or, you
[2:52:48.740 --> 2:52:52.500]  know, on a bigger platform like info wars, because things are getting bad and they're
[2:52:52.500 --> 2:52:57.140]  getting bad fast and people need to get their heads out of their butts and what is the end
[2:52:57.140 --> 2:52:58.540]  game of this?
[2:52:58.540 --> 2:53:01.820]  Because some feminists say it's okay to be raped by a Muslim.
[2:53:01.820 --> 2:53:03.660]  It's like a weird, weird cucking.
[2:53:03.660 --> 2:53:05.980]  But I mean, what's the end game to this?
[2:53:05.980 --> 2:53:07.780]  Because it's all over Europe.
[2:53:07.780 --> 2:53:10.180]  Women are having to wear a jibs now to go out.
[2:53:10.180 --> 2:53:13.580]  Liberal, the mayor of Cologne says don't wear a miniskirt.
[2:53:13.580 --> 2:53:14.580]  It's your fault.
[2:53:14.580 --> 2:53:18.980]  I mean, it's like if a Western man looks at a woman, it's raped in a Gillette commercial.
[2:53:18.980 --> 2:53:22.460]  But if Muslim men rape a woman, it's, it's like a sacrament.
[2:53:22.460 --> 2:53:23.460]  Right.
[2:53:23.460 --> 2:53:27.700]  And, you know, I think that's what, what's happened here where we've let the ideology
[2:53:27.700 --> 2:53:33.300]  of modern feminism has, has de-masculated men across the West.
[2:53:33.300 --> 2:53:34.300]  And is that it?
[2:53:34.300 --> 2:53:37.500]  Modern feminism is just anti-Western, anti-Christian.
[2:53:37.500 --> 2:53:39.100]  It actually likes women being gang raped.
[2:53:39.100 --> 2:53:43.020]  I mean, it, it, because they have feminists on TV saying wear the jib, you know, it's
[2:53:43.020 --> 2:53:44.020]  the new thing.
[2:53:44.020 --> 2:53:47.060]  It's a 13 year olds, married 30 year olds, you know, push women down the stairs, break
[2:53:47.060 --> 2:53:48.060]  their necks.
[2:53:48.060 --> 2:53:49.060]  It's so trendy.
[2:53:49.060 --> 2:53:50.060]  Yeah.
[2:53:50.060 --> 2:53:52.180]  I mean, this video, this one makes me one of the maddest.
[2:53:52.180 --> 2:53:53.180]  This one's crazy.
[2:53:53.180 --> 2:53:58.940]  Um, no, I think that, uh, men have abdicated, abdicated the role at this point across the
[2:53:58.940 --> 2:53:59.940]  West.
[2:53:59.940 --> 2:54:04.180]  And now we are seeing what happens because a lot of the men in these other cultures,
[2:54:04.180 --> 2:54:05.900]  they don't, they don't care about feminism.
[2:54:05.900 --> 2:54:06.900]  They couldn't care less about it.
[2:54:06.900 --> 2:54:09.020]  They see women as dogs.
[2:54:09.020 --> 2:54:11.900]  And so they use that the West puts women on a pedestal.
[2:54:11.900 --> 2:54:15.020]  The West is all about goddess worship, people that don't know the ethos of the West.
[2:54:15.020 --> 2:54:19.300]  We put women on a pedestal and then now comes a group that treats them literally like toilet
[2:54:19.300 --> 2:54:24.460]  paper and the women, instead of like wanting a man that's nice to them, they get the reverse
[2:54:24.460 --> 2:54:26.340]  cock and a lot of them actually like it.
[2:54:26.340 --> 2:54:28.420]  Their job broken by Islamists.
[2:54:28.420 --> 2:54:29.420]  Yeah.
[2:54:29.420 --> 2:54:32.820]  And, you know, I think, you know, some people will say, you know, especially from the U S
[2:54:32.820 --> 2:54:35.180]  I'll say, Oh, well, this is what they voted for.
[2:54:35.180 --> 2:54:36.180]  Let him have it.
[2:54:36.180 --> 2:54:37.180]  Or this is where Europe's headed.
[2:54:37.180 --> 2:54:38.500]  You know, let them take it.
[2:54:38.500 --> 2:54:39.500]  People aren't standing up.
[2:54:39.500 --> 2:54:44.860]  No, it's, it's, it's a very small faction of people that are, that are very aggressive
[2:54:44.860 --> 2:54:48.700]  and they're driving this agenda across the West and especially in Europe.
[2:54:48.700 --> 2:54:52.060]  And there are a lot of guys who have just stepped aside, who are soy boys.
[2:54:52.060 --> 2:54:53.060]  What do you do?
[2:54:53.060 --> 2:54:57.940]  We can show footage in Berlin where we're not going to show the shirts off the women
[2:54:57.940 --> 2:55:00.500]  pull their shirts off and go Allah Akbar.
[2:55:00.500 --> 2:55:01.500]  We want Islam.
[2:55:01.500 --> 2:55:03.500]  And the Muslim women are like, Yes, bitch.
[2:55:03.500 --> 2:55:05.500]  You build mouth on me.
[2:55:05.500 --> 2:55:06.500]  Yes.
[2:55:06.500 --> 2:55:07.500]  I mean, let's put up the audio.
[2:55:07.500 --> 2:55:12.420]  There are feminist praising, general mutilation, women and slave pets.
[2:55:12.420 --> 2:55:13.420]  These aren't even women.
[2:55:13.420 --> 2:55:14.820]  I mean, these are barely human beings.
[2:55:14.820 --> 2:55:15.820]  Look at these.
[2:55:15.820 --> 2:55:18.100]  They're, they're zombies from a different planet.
[2:55:18.100 --> 2:55:23.620]  These type of super feminist lesbians, I don't hate women like women.
[2:55:23.620 --> 2:55:28.300]  But these, this type are like wannabe men and what women as prisoners.
[2:55:28.300 --> 2:55:32.060]  So they statistically are the most abusive other than Muslim men.
[2:55:32.060 --> 2:55:35.580]  They like Muslim men because they want kept women.
[2:55:35.580 --> 2:55:37.580]  Definitely.
[2:55:37.580 --> 2:55:41.060]  And you know, and, and going back to just that, not what, what can we do?
[2:55:41.060 --> 2:55:45.140]  Well, there, there is a problem with, with, with what we can do because now we can't even
[2:55:45.140 --> 2:55:46.580]  speak out against it.
[2:55:46.580 --> 2:55:50.340]  And, and I just saw this new release, a press release from the European Commission just
[2:55:50.340 --> 2:55:56.540]  came out today reminding us all that they, they are the IT companies, which they categorize
[2:55:56.540 --> 2:56:02.180]  as the big four as Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube are doing such a great job of
[2:56:02.180 --> 2:56:08.260]  flagging content within 24 hours, 89% of flag content is reviewed and blah, blah, blah.
[2:56:08.260 --> 2:56:12.860]  And then it reminds us that combating racism and xenophobia is the name of the program
[2:56:12.860 --> 2:56:18.020]  criminalizes the public incitement to violence or hatred directed against a group of persons
[2:56:18.020 --> 2:56:22.500]  or a member of such group defined by reference to race, color, religion, descent, blah, blah,
[2:56:22.500 --> 2:56:23.500]  blah.
[2:56:23.500 --> 2:56:27.300]  And then it says to respond to the proliferation of racist and xenophobic hate speech online,
[2:56:27.300 --> 2:56:31.460]  the European Commission and four major IT companies, the ones I listed presented the
[2:56:31.460 --> 2:56:35.140]  code of conduct back in 2016 and they are rolling that out.
[2:56:35.140 --> 2:56:36.140]  And then it's happening now.
[2:56:36.140 --> 2:56:40.300]  And, and we saw that just the other day with a guy who he happened to just retweet a limerick
[2:56:40.300 --> 2:56:44.340]  that was making fun of transgender women, he got to knock at the door from the police.
[2:56:44.340 --> 2:56:48.100]  So if people don't understand what's going on in Europe, you better wake up fast because
[2:56:48.100 --> 2:56:49.700]  the police will knock at your door.
[2:56:49.700 --> 2:56:54.860]  If you say anything bad about the invasion of your countries by men who are content with
[2:56:54.860 --> 2:56:59.620]  raping 10 year old girls and let's be clear, the leftist, the big banks have made the decision
[2:56:59.620 --> 2:57:04.660]  neutralize the men in the West, open up to Islam, overrun us, let them cut genitals off,
[2:57:04.660 --> 2:57:10.020]  put women in slave camps, murder whoever they want, because they're the muscle coming in.
[2:57:10.020 --> 2:57:13.460]  We're just told to stand down or we can't sit there and tweet to our friends.
[2:57:13.460 --> 2:57:15.980]  And this is a takeover, Dan.
[2:57:15.980 --> 2:57:16.980]  It sure is.
[2:57:16.980 --> 2:57:20.740]  And yeah, we're watching it unfold in high speed now.
[2:57:20.740 --> 2:57:23.500]  Let me ask you when we come back, let me do a segment of calls, let's hear how slow they
[2:57:23.500 --> 2:57:24.500]  take over.
[2:57:24.500 --> 2:57:25.900]  He's loading for bearer.
[2:57:25.900 --> 2:57:29.980]  What's coming next and how bad you think it's going to get before it hits rock bottom and
[2:57:29.980 --> 2:57:36.740]  how long have the average left to stay cut in this weird religion of self destruction?
[2:57:36.740 --> 2:57:37.900]  Or they should just move to the Middle East.
[2:57:37.900 --> 2:57:38.900]  I think it's so great.
[2:57:38.900 --> 2:57:39.900]  We'll be back.
[2:57:39.900 --> 2:57:41.780]  Hour number four helps spread those live links.
[2:57:41.780 --> 2:57:54.620]  You're our only hope.
[2:57:54.620 --> 2:57:56.940]  High leaps and by bounds.
[2:57:56.940 --> 2:58:03.660]  The number one best selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[2:58:03.660 --> 2:58:09.180]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that
[2:58:09.180 --> 2:58:13.700]  sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[2:58:13.700 --> 2:58:20.300]  We have developed hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout
[2:58:20.300 --> 2:58:23.140]  and beyond system in the world.
[2:58:23.140 --> 2:58:25.580]  There's nothing else like it, you must experience it.
[2:58:25.580 --> 2:58:30.140]  It is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use, packets to mix in with fruit
[2:58:30.140 --> 2:58:32.580]  juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[2:58:32.580 --> 2:58:36.460]  Warning though, it's very, very strong, it lasts 10 hours, so take a half packet the
[2:58:36.460 --> 2:58:40.460]  first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you
[2:58:40.460 --> 2:58:41.620]  into overdrive.
[2:58:41.620 --> 2:58:46.700]  TurboForce and enforcelife.com.
[2:58:46.700 --> 2:58:50.540]  Our grandparents, the great grandparents, knows they can food during the falls they'd
[2:58:50.540 --> 2:58:52.540]  have it during the winter.
[2:58:52.540 --> 2:58:55.700]  And that's what I'm talking about at enforce.com.
[2:58:55.700 --> 2:59:01.780]  With enforce select, it's the full spectrum of my patriots supply on the top, most respected
[2:59:01.780 --> 2:59:02.780]  companies out there.
[2:59:02.780 --> 2:59:08.380]  But because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their
[2:59:08.380 --> 2:59:10.460]  other distributors aren't able to do.
[2:59:10.460 --> 2:59:14.740]  But I want to be a market leader and I want you to have storeable food so it's a total
[2:59:14.740 --> 2:59:15.740]  win-win.
[2:59:15.740 --> 2:59:20.740]  We have those incredible sell prices back at enforce.com on enforce select, storeable
[2:59:20.740 --> 2:59:25.820]  foods, they've got special diet foods, they've got three-month supplies, your supplies, weak
[2:59:25.820 --> 2:59:29.860]  emergency supplies, they've got so many great products there, maybe you got a three-year
[2:59:29.860 --> 2:59:30.860]  supply.
[2:59:30.860 --> 2:59:32.820]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[2:59:32.820 --> 2:59:35.380]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[2:59:35.380 --> 2:59:40.300]  You're buying war bonds, bringing great products, and together with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[2:59:40.300 --> 2:59:49.420]  enforce.com and enforce select, high-quality, storeable foods, powered by my patriots supply.
[2:59:49.420 --> 2:59:58.420]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:59:58.420 --> 3:00:05.020]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of
[3:00:05.020 --> 3:00:08.020]  the Info War.
[3:00:08.020 --> 3:00:14.780]  By the way, folks, let's be clear, statistics in the main don't lie.
[3:00:14.780 --> 3:00:18.420]  I was against all these Gulf Wars, I didn't want to destabilize the Middle East.
[3:00:18.420 --> 3:00:24.180]  I was against the Arab Spring because we were putting bad people in.
[3:00:24.180 --> 3:00:30.220]  But you can't go to any of the 40-something or 50-something Muslim countries and be a
[3:00:30.220 --> 3:00:35.420]  Christian or tease the gospel, or if you're two gay guys, sit there and do your kissy-kiss
[3:00:35.420 --> 3:00:39.020]  on the street, you get killed.
[3:00:39.020 --> 3:00:43.820]  And then it's all America that's bad, it's Europe that's bad, and then we bring in
[3:00:43.820 --> 3:00:49.460]  military-aged men, five years in on average, 80-plus percent are still on welfare, not
[3:00:49.460 --> 3:00:50.460]  working.
[3:00:50.460 --> 3:00:57.380]  We got a bunch of people wearing Halloween outfits, full-body nightgowns, strutting
[3:00:57.380 --> 3:01:03.420]  around bitching with their oiled beards, gibbering at everyone, and then their women are all
[3:01:03.420 --> 3:01:04.420]  locked up as prisoners.
[3:01:04.420 --> 3:01:12.620]  I mean, I'm done, I'm done, I can't go to their country, no, they got to come here and
[3:01:12.620 --> 3:01:16.980]  I got to roll over as they can have their way with me, Dan Lyman.
[3:01:16.980 --> 3:01:20.340]  So what's coming next, Dan, of EuropeWars.com?
[3:01:20.340 --> 3:01:25.820]  I fear what's coming next is something that nobody wants.
[3:01:25.820 --> 3:01:30.900]  Stefan Malinou just delivered an excellent speech at European Parliament last week and
[3:01:30.900 --> 3:01:35.620]  it just became made available today, and it was about big tech censorship, and he made
[3:01:35.620 --> 3:01:42.500]  the great point that previously people were allowed to discuss and debate things and talk
[3:01:42.500 --> 3:01:45.900]  about where they wanted society to go.
[3:01:45.900 --> 3:01:52.260]  And increasingly conservatives and just anti-leftists, anti-globalists are being silenced and they're
[3:01:52.260 --> 3:01:58.140]  not allowed to carry on a dialogue, a civilized debate about what's going on in our countries
[3:01:58.140 --> 3:02:01.780]  and each policy and what's being implemented.
[3:02:01.780 --> 3:02:09.380]  And when you suppress that medium of people being able to kind of let off the steam valve
[3:02:09.380 --> 3:02:15.380]  and have a say in what's going on and keep the push and pull from left and right in balance,
[3:02:15.380 --> 3:02:20.500]  if you take that away and you just drive this crazy leftist feminist globalist agenda without
[3:02:20.500 --> 3:02:25.380]  anyone even being allowed to say anything about it in the negative, then the pendulum
[3:02:25.380 --> 3:02:28.580]  is going to swing back in the opposite direction and it's not going to be pretty.
[3:02:28.580 --> 3:02:33.140]  And that's what I fear at this point with the way that things are going in France is
[3:02:33.140 --> 3:02:34.220]  just the beginning.
[3:02:34.220 --> 3:02:38.460]  It's just the beginning and it's going to get crazier in other countries.
[3:02:38.460 --> 3:02:43.180]  Every time there is a controversial killing by migrants in Germany, the protests get a
[3:02:43.180 --> 3:02:48.060]  little bit bigger and soon you get a few more of those and they're going to be out of control
[3:02:48.060 --> 3:02:51.620]  and France is going to feed off that and things in the UK, they're going to feed off
[3:02:51.620 --> 3:02:52.620]  that as well.
[3:02:52.620 --> 3:02:56.660]  Sweden, I mean, they have to be up to their eyeballs in it right now at this point.
[3:02:56.660 --> 3:03:03.220]  So you just, you oppress people long enough and you're not going to like when the boiler
[3:03:03.220 --> 3:03:04.220]  just explodes.
[3:03:04.220 --> 3:03:08.940]  Well, you're exactly right and then the French police have been caught saying, shoot him in
[3:03:08.940 --> 3:03:09.940]  the face.
[3:03:09.940 --> 3:03:11.860]  That's only making the protests get bigger.
[3:03:11.860 --> 3:03:16.340]  Don't they get that people were asleep before they're awake now.
[3:03:16.340 --> 3:03:17.740]  They always thought, oh, we were intimidated.
[3:03:17.740 --> 3:03:18.940]  That's why we didn't fight back.
[3:03:18.940 --> 3:03:20.700]  No, we were asleep.
[3:03:20.700 --> 3:03:24.140]  Don't they get that attacking us only awakens us?
[3:03:24.140 --> 3:03:28.740]  They've woken the sleeping giant and with each thing that right there you have Mr. Rodriguez
[3:03:28.740 --> 3:03:33.260]  who now has suffered a life changing injury and all he was doing was just filming live
[3:03:33.260 --> 3:03:37.620]  streaming on Facebook and they shot him with one of these flashballs apparently.
[3:03:37.620 --> 3:03:41.380]  And so that, that has been another rallying cry for the yellow vests.
[3:03:41.380 --> 3:03:46.340]  So every time they do something like this, they ratchet up the response and they're not
[3:03:46.340 --> 3:03:49.820]  going to like it if they keep pushing the French, you know, further and further over
[3:03:49.820 --> 3:03:52.020]  the edge and it doesn't look like they're going to stop.
[3:03:52.020 --> 3:03:53.820]  I mean, they're going to, they're going to keep pushing them.
[3:03:53.820 --> 3:03:59.220]  So it wouldn't surprise me.
[3:03:59.220 --> 3:04:00.220]  Nothing would surprise me.
[3:04:00.220 --> 3:04:01.740]  The historical precedent is there.
[3:04:01.740 --> 3:04:06.740]  So we just all need to be, you know, as reserved as possible and handling all this.
[3:04:06.740 --> 3:04:08.620]  But the revolution's on.
[3:04:08.620 --> 3:04:12.860]  The populist revolution is on and I don't see it slowing down.
[3:04:12.860 --> 3:04:16.620]  I agree with you and you know, you've got all these insulated elitists like Jack Dorsey
[3:04:16.620 --> 3:04:21.420]  and Joe Rogan and McCron and, and they don't seem to get what's happened here.
[3:04:21.420 --> 3:04:25.620]  This is a, this, nobody's put the genie back in the bottle.
[3:04:25.620 --> 3:04:28.820]  A lot of them seem like they're on drugs.
[3:04:28.820 --> 3:04:30.300]  That's what I boil it down to.
[3:04:30.300 --> 3:04:31.860]  And that's right.
[3:04:31.860 --> 3:04:33.580]  Well, you're not, you're on truth.
[3:04:33.580 --> 3:04:35.820]  Dan Lyman is awesome.
[3:04:35.820 --> 3:04:38.420]  See his incredible work at Europe Wars.com.
[3:04:38.420 --> 3:04:40.260]  Only you can override the sensors.

[3:04:45.620 --> 3:04:46.620]  Thanks Dan Lyman.

[3:05:01.820 --> 3:05:03.780]  products can give you a short boost.

[3:06:14.020 --> 3:06:30.060]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[3:06:30.060 --> 3:06:49.140]  Friends, research.com, Zeryl Salente, best selling author, one of the top analysts in
[3:06:49.140 --> 3:06:52.620]  the world about the economy and where things are going and the global revolution he predicted
[3:06:52.620 --> 3:06:53.620]  over a decade ago.
[3:06:53.620 --> 3:06:57.700]  He's coming up next segment, but I promise to get to all your calls, even though we limited
[3:06:57.700 --> 3:07:01.580]  the amount of calls to come in about 12 at a time, so I'm going to get to Frank, James
[3:07:01.580 --> 3:07:02.900]  and Jeff and that's it.
[3:07:02.900 --> 3:07:04.660]  So thank you for holding.
[3:07:04.660 --> 3:07:08.540]  Let's go ahead and go to Frank, James and then Jeff.
[3:07:08.540 --> 3:07:10.020]  Frank, thanks for holding from North Carolina.
[3:07:10.020 --> 3:07:11.020]  Go ahead.
[3:07:11.020 --> 3:07:18.900]  Alex, you know, I'd call it in about something else, but I agree with everything your guest
[3:07:18.900 --> 3:07:19.900]  just said.
[3:07:19.900 --> 3:07:26.180]  However, going even further and being more politically incorrect, I just have to say
[3:07:26.180 --> 3:07:33.180]  that statistics for a long time have shown pretty steadily that over 30,000 white women
[3:07:33.180 --> 3:07:35.660]  a year are raped in the United States.
[3:07:35.660 --> 3:07:40.540]  And you know, statistics are a funny thing, but less than one black woman a year is raped
[3:07:40.540 --> 3:07:43.100]  by a white man in the United States of America.
[3:07:43.100 --> 3:07:49.420]  How come we don't have athletes getting down on one knee and protesting and bringing attention
[3:07:49.420 --> 3:07:52.820]  to this epidemic that's going on in America?
[3:07:52.820 --> 3:07:57.620]  Well, Frank, it is true that there's 10 to 1 black on white crime and the media covers
[3:07:57.620 --> 3:07:58.620]  it up.
[3:07:58.620 --> 3:08:01.380]  Doesn't mean we hate all black people, but the media has created a culture where this
[3:08:01.380 --> 3:08:02.380]  is okay.
[3:08:02.380 --> 3:08:06.020]  The new Black Panther Party has said this, you had the lacrosse team that didn't touch
[3:08:06.020 --> 3:08:10.180]  the black lady, but they made that up and they lost a lawsuit.
[3:08:10.180 --> 3:08:15.140]  So what you're saying is true, but this is, I need your help, Frank.
[3:08:15.140 --> 3:08:19.060]  You haven't called in over a year, Frank, so I appreciate you calling in.
[3:08:19.060 --> 3:08:20.580]  This is Frank, isn't it?
[3:08:20.580 --> 3:08:24.580]  Yeah, it's been over 13 months, actually.
[3:08:24.580 --> 3:08:29.780]  But you know, I really think you need to give some time for a response, because you know,
[3:08:29.780 --> 3:08:35.900]  this movie, I guess, Aang DeHurtt, probably, in some weird way, but you know, it's supposed
[3:08:35.900 --> 3:08:38.460]  to be about David Duke, the Black Plansman.
[3:08:38.460 --> 3:08:41.740]  I think you really ought to have him on to respond to this, because he can basically
[3:08:41.740 --> 3:08:42.740]  break it down.
[3:08:42.740 --> 3:08:45.220]  The whole movie is nothing but a bunch of lies.
[3:08:45.220 --> 3:08:47.220]  It's totally fictitious.
[3:08:47.220 --> 3:08:53.380]  Well, I'll say this, I don't agree with David Duke's policies, but he's not half as racist
[3:08:53.380 --> 3:08:57.540]  as somebody like Alexandra Cortez or Barack Obama.
[3:08:57.540 --> 3:09:01.260]  So my whole thing is, this is all a bunch of racism.
[3:09:01.260 --> 3:09:04.060]  The whole country's just sending in to race this, race that.
[3:09:04.060 --> 3:09:10.100]  I turn the TV on, Mary Poppins is racist, being white is evil, and it's meant to make
[3:09:10.100 --> 3:09:11.260]  white people racist.
[3:09:11.260 --> 3:09:13.300]  Look, it's just like a prison.
[3:09:13.300 --> 3:09:17.140]  You got the black area, you got the Hispanic area and the white area.
[3:09:17.140 --> 3:09:19.380]  And if it's on the east or west coast, the Asian area.
[3:09:19.380 --> 3:09:21.580]  So three to four groups, they're all divided.
[3:09:21.580 --> 3:09:23.420]  The Warren controls everybody.
[3:09:23.420 --> 3:09:25.380]  The Warden does.
[3:09:25.380 --> 3:09:29.300]  I'd rather not have us all fight with each other and be unified around the Bill of Rights,
[3:09:29.300 --> 3:09:32.420]  the Constitution, and prosperity, Frank.
[3:09:32.420 --> 3:09:35.260]  But hey, Frank, I beg for your help.
[3:09:35.260 --> 3:09:37.180]  Frank, are you going to help me?
[3:09:37.180 --> 3:09:39.500]  Have you gone to infowarstore.com?
[3:09:39.500 --> 3:09:43.780]  Have you been supporting us, Frank, because I'm not perfect, Frank, but I need your help,
[3:09:43.780 --> 3:09:44.780]  Frank.
[3:09:44.780 --> 3:09:47.380]  How about you get David Duke on?
[3:09:47.380 --> 3:09:48.380]  Oh, David Duke.
[3:09:48.380 --> 3:09:50.940]  Like, if anybody's a reptilian, it's David Duke.
[3:09:50.940 --> 3:09:54.420]  You know, I interviewed Lewis Farrakhan, who I disagree with a lot on.
[3:09:54.420 --> 3:09:56.460]  But he wanted to try to stop race for him.
[3:09:56.460 --> 3:10:01.620]  And then when I had Duke on, all Duke did was sit there and try to make points.
[3:10:01.620 --> 3:10:06.420]  The entire time, I'm some Zionist shill, which is a load of crap.
[3:10:06.420 --> 3:10:11.460]  So the whole David Duke experience was worse than I thought it'd be.
[3:10:11.460 --> 3:10:14.340]  Duke agrees with Farrakhan on quite a bit.
[3:10:14.340 --> 3:10:15.700]  He talks about it all the time.
[3:10:15.700 --> 3:10:18.980]  He's always talking about Farrakhan on his show.
[3:10:18.980 --> 3:10:24.300]  He doesn't like when Farrakhan speaks hatefully against white people, but he actually agrees
[3:10:24.300 --> 3:10:26.700]  and has a lot of common ground with Farrakhan.
[3:10:26.700 --> 3:10:32.140]  And Duke has no problem with people, with black leaders looking out for the interests
[3:10:32.140 --> 3:10:33.140]  of black people.
[3:10:33.140 --> 3:10:34.140]  He actually...
[3:10:34.140 --> 3:10:36.740]  Look, obviously, whites are under attack.
[3:10:36.740 --> 3:10:37.980]  No one's debating that.
[3:10:37.980 --> 3:10:43.900]  All I'm saying to you is, the globalists are trying to abort all the babies.
[3:10:43.900 --> 3:10:46.300]  The globalists are putting fluoride in all the water.
[3:10:46.300 --> 3:10:49.060]  And I just, at a gut level, really want...
[3:10:49.060 --> 3:10:53.060]  I don't want to get into some leftist tit for tat and play their game, but I don't want
[3:10:53.060 --> 3:10:57.220]  to get into some David Duke stuff or Lewis Farrakhan stuff.
[3:10:57.220 --> 3:11:00.260]  He's one of the most hated men in the world.
[3:11:00.260 --> 3:11:02.420]  He's a great guest.
[3:11:02.420 --> 3:11:06.420]  Oh, nobody's taking David Duke's bank accounts away.
[3:11:06.420 --> 3:11:07.420]  He's still on YouTube.
[3:11:07.420 --> 3:11:08.420]  I'm not.
[3:11:08.420 --> 3:11:09.780]  Why have I been taking off everywhere?
[3:11:09.780 --> 3:11:13.540]  He's had a lot of problems, Alex.
[3:11:13.540 --> 3:11:19.980]  I'm not saying take David Duke or Lewis Farrakhan off, and I'm not endorsing him either.
[3:11:19.980 --> 3:11:23.180]  They do not have half the problems I have.
[3:11:23.180 --> 3:11:24.180]  Believe me.
[3:11:24.180 --> 3:11:25.380]  Oh, they're staging attacks.
[3:11:25.380 --> 3:11:26.380]  Oh, yeah.
[3:11:26.380 --> 3:11:28.660]  Let me tell you, they're real staged.
[3:11:28.660 --> 3:11:30.620]  I wouldn't want to feel real attacks then.
[3:11:30.620 --> 3:11:35.460]  They've been kicking a little snot out of me here, so I appreciate your call, man.
[3:11:35.460 --> 3:11:38.020]  You know, here's my deal.
[3:11:38.020 --> 3:11:41.780]  I just can't look at little kids, Hispanic kids, black kids, white kids, and just think
[3:11:41.780 --> 3:11:42.780]  of them as different.
[3:11:42.780 --> 3:11:44.540]  I just can't do it.
[3:11:44.540 --> 3:11:46.660]  I just can't do it.
[3:11:46.660 --> 3:11:49.220]  And it doesn't matter if it's a bunch of white racists, a bunch of black racists.
[3:11:49.220 --> 3:11:50.220]  I mean, hell, I know.
[3:11:50.220 --> 3:11:51.620]  They act like only whites are racists.
[3:11:51.620 --> 3:11:52.620]  Give me a break.
[3:11:52.620 --> 3:11:53.620]  I grew up in Dallas, Texas, man.
[3:11:53.620 --> 3:11:57.060]  Some of those racist people in the world are black people, but some of them are really
[3:11:57.060 --> 3:11:59.260]  nice, good people, too.
[3:11:59.260 --> 3:12:02.380]  And so I just, I don't get down on that level.
[3:12:02.380 --> 3:12:07.460]  It doesn't mean that stuff's not going on, and I'm not buying into white guilt either.
[3:12:07.460 --> 3:12:08.460]  God almighty.
[3:12:08.460 --> 3:12:16.180]  I got a bunch of calls that you also want to take over, but I don't know what to do
[3:12:16.180 --> 3:12:17.180]  anymore.
[3:12:17.180 --> 3:12:18.180]  I just don't know what to do.
[3:12:18.180 --> 3:12:20.300]  We're just going to kill each other.
[3:12:20.300 --> 3:12:23.020]  I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
[3:12:23.020 --> 3:12:24.380]  Jeff in Canada, you're on the air.
[3:12:24.380 --> 3:12:25.380]  Go ahead.
[3:12:25.380 --> 3:12:32.780]  Hey, Alex, I just want to say just straight out, I love who you are as a person.
[3:12:32.780 --> 3:12:37.860]  I love the spirit of God in you and how you deliver what you deliver on a daily basis.
[3:12:37.860 --> 3:12:38.860]  That's phenomenal.
[3:12:38.860 --> 3:12:39.860]  Well, thanks for putting up with me, brother.
[3:12:39.860 --> 3:12:41.340]  I love you, too.
[3:12:41.340 --> 3:12:48.220]  Hey, and I think you realize, and you put that out there all the time, there's two operating
[3:12:48.220 --> 3:12:49.220]  systems in the world.
[3:12:49.220 --> 3:12:52.260]  There's the spirit of Christ, and there's the spirit of Antichrist.
[3:12:52.260 --> 3:12:59.780]  And you think all these petty issues and satanic little cards in the deck, we can cover those
[3:12:59.780 --> 3:13:00.780]  all day.
[3:13:00.780 --> 3:13:05.860]  And I think you do a brilliant job of doing that, but I want to speak something out to
[3:13:05.860 --> 3:13:09.300]  you and just I'll let it sit with you.
[3:13:09.300 --> 3:13:14.340]  You shared a story one time of an ancestor that filled up a boatload of Bibles and took
[3:13:14.340 --> 3:13:22.220]  them to Texas, and it really brought the word of God and the gospel to Texas.
[3:13:22.220 --> 3:13:27.900]  And I really think there's a destiny on your life from the seed of what happened there
[3:13:27.900 --> 3:13:32.860]  to now put the gospel through the airways around the world to every man, woman and child
[3:13:32.860 --> 3:13:41.780]  of every color and creed and belief and really talk about the love of God because I'll tell
[3:13:41.780 --> 3:13:47.260]  you in an individual level, you can be satanically possessed and have a million things wrong
[3:13:47.260 --> 3:13:48.260]  with you.
[3:13:48.260 --> 3:13:52.260]  And Jesus is the only thing that breaks that yoke over people's lives.
[3:13:52.260 --> 3:13:59.340]  What we need to see is a awakening of people linked together in the spirit of Jesus, not
[3:13:59.340 --> 3:14:01.420]  dead religion, but the spirit of Jesus.
[3:14:01.420 --> 3:14:05.900]  Well, I totally agree with you and even if somebody's an atheist, should we be together
[3:14:05.900 --> 3:14:06.900]  in the golden rule?
[3:14:06.900 --> 3:14:07.900]  And I'm not an atheist.
[3:14:07.900 --> 3:14:08.900]  I believe in God.
[3:14:08.900 --> 3:14:11.340]  Instead of just being controlled by Hollywood.
[3:14:11.340 --> 3:14:12.340]  I appreciate your call.
[3:14:12.340 --> 3:14:15.940]  James and Utah last caller, Charles, they've taken over on the other side.
[3:14:15.940 --> 3:14:16.940]  Go ahead, James.
[3:14:16.940 --> 3:14:20.660]  Hi, thanks for taking my call.
[3:14:20.660 --> 3:14:21.660]  I really appreciate it.
[3:14:21.660 --> 3:14:22.660]  Appreciate you.
[3:14:22.660 --> 3:14:29.540]  Oh, I just I wanted to mention and thank you for opening my eyes because I have a little
[3:14:29.540 --> 3:14:35.260]  little daughter and to vaccines and, you know, people did they act like I'm crazy, you know,
[3:14:35.260 --> 3:14:36.260]  or something like that.
[3:14:36.260 --> 3:14:38.260]  Like, oh, you know, they're fine.
[3:14:38.260 --> 3:14:39.260]  They're harmless.
[3:14:39.260 --> 3:14:40.260]  Nothing.
[3:14:40.260 --> 3:14:43.660]  And then I woke up things, you know, vaccine damage, fine.
[3:14:43.660 --> 3:14:49.180]  The side effects are like brain damage, fever, all these other, oh yeah, that's all of that
[3:14:49.180 --> 3:14:51.420]  by the medical staff to make you feel like a cook.
[3:14:51.420 --> 3:14:54.740]  And then you talk to the nurses later, they go, Oh, none of us take them either.
[3:14:54.740 --> 3:14:55.740]  Exactly.
[3:14:55.740 --> 3:14:56.740]  It's all a hoax.
[3:14:56.740 --> 3:15:04.060]  It's it's an attack on men, to be honest, by gone on the nuclear family.
[3:15:04.060 --> 3:15:09.980]  Man woman child, they just want to destroy it exactly the idea of the man and the woman
[3:15:09.980 --> 3:15:14.300]  being on a team and caring about each other and building a nest.
[3:15:14.300 --> 3:15:15.300]  That's independence.
[3:15:15.300 --> 3:15:16.940]  That's pure synergy.
[3:15:16.940 --> 3:15:17.940]  That's a union.
[3:15:17.940 --> 3:15:20.460]  That's some simplistic beauty.
[3:15:20.460 --> 3:15:23.220]  That is absolute completion.
[3:15:23.220 --> 3:15:24.860]  And that's what they don't want you to have.
[3:15:24.860 --> 3:15:25.860]  God bless you, James.
[3:15:25.860 --> 3:15:30.740]  All right, Gerald Salente, the trans forecaster is on the other side of his break.
[3:15:30.740 --> 3:15:32.340]  There he is, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:15:32.340 --> 3:15:36.780]  And then coming up in 45 minutes, the war room with Owen Shroyer.
[3:15:36.780 --> 3:15:39.540]  Remember, it isn't patronization.
[3:15:39.540 --> 3:15:46.540]  If you don't spread the articles, if you don't tell people about the length, if you don't
[3:15:46.540 --> 3:15:49.980]  push the ball forward, the enemy wins, you take action, we win.
[3:15:49.980 --> 3:15:50.980]  We'll be right back.

[3:21:10.700 --> 3:21:15.140]  Back in the day, it would have never allowed these monopolies to be in place.
[3:21:15.140 --> 3:21:23.060]  We almost had a revolution back in the 30s and in the 20s and earlier.
[3:21:23.060 --> 3:21:28.220]  All the laws put in place, the Robinson Patman Act, Sherman Antitrust Act, Clayton Antitrust
[3:21:28.220 --> 3:21:33.580]  Act, to prevent the monopolies from taking over, and now the monopolies are in your
[3:21:33.580 --> 3:21:34.580]  face.
[3:21:34.580 --> 3:21:43.700]  It's not a game anymore, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Twitter, look at all the large companies,
[3:21:43.700 --> 3:21:53.940]  the home depots, the staples that put so many of we the people out of work and let
[3:21:53.940 --> 3:21:57.180]  all the money go to the top.
[3:21:57.180 --> 3:22:03.740]  So the guest was earlier talking about the Yellow Vest movement in France, it's real.
[3:22:03.740 --> 3:22:10.100]  And one of the reasons why it's real, this is a fact.
[3:22:10.100 --> 3:22:21.580]  The richest 1% owned 50% of stocks held by American household, 1% owned 50%.
[3:22:21.580 --> 3:22:29.660]  The monopolies have taken over the world, it's called multinational firms.
[3:22:29.660 --> 3:22:35.020]  It's called globalization, and that's why they're fighting against nationalism.
[3:22:35.020 --> 3:22:42.260]  How dare we hold on to the American way, or the Italian way, the Spanish way, the Greek
[3:22:42.260 --> 3:22:45.460]  way, the German way.
[3:22:45.460 --> 3:22:52.360]  How dare we hold on to our nationality and our ethnicity.
[3:22:52.360 --> 3:23:03.780]  We have to become slaves in slave landia and work on the global multinational plantations.
[3:23:03.780 --> 3:23:09.660]  So the Yellow Vest movement, look what's going on.
[3:23:09.660 --> 3:23:16.780]  I'm totally against, of course I launched Occupypeace, Occupypeace.com, and I was down
[3:23:16.780 --> 3:23:26.900]  in DC this past August as a speaker at Ron Paul's Peace and Prosperity Conference.
[3:23:26.900 --> 3:23:31.620]  So I put my money in my heart and my soul where my mouth is.
[3:23:31.620 --> 3:23:37.100]  I'm totally against what's going on with the planned overthrow of the government of
[3:23:37.100 --> 3:23:39.100]  Venezuela.
[3:23:39.100 --> 3:23:42.140]  We have no business telling them what to do.
[3:23:42.140 --> 3:23:51.180]  An America's track record of bringing democracy and freedom to other countries is a complete
[3:23:51.180 --> 3:23:55.100]  recipe for disaster by the facts.
[3:23:55.100 --> 3:23:58.940]  Hey, wonderful going to Iraq, huh?
[3:23:58.940 --> 3:24:05.580]  How about Libya, you want to go there for a vacation, maybe, on the shores of Tripoli?
[3:24:05.580 --> 3:24:06.580]  What about Syria?
[3:24:06.580 --> 3:24:16.820]  I forgot about Yemen, oh Afghanistan, Haiti, beautiful job they've done there.
[3:24:16.820 --> 3:24:23.300]  One foreign entanglement after another that causes more hardship for the people and hatred
[3:24:23.300 --> 3:24:26.260]  against America.
[3:24:26.260 --> 3:24:32.100]  And you hate a country that comes in, you know, we don't like this guy Trump.
[3:24:32.100 --> 3:24:35.180]  We don't like what he's doing to the people.
[3:24:35.180 --> 3:24:41.380]  You look at his low popularity ratings, you look at who he is, I say we should go over
[3:24:41.380 --> 3:24:49.580]  there and invade the United States and put in a new leader who we support.
[3:24:49.580 --> 3:25:01.620]  And that leader, no, no, not Juan Guaido from Venezuela, who declared himself, hey, I'm
[3:25:01.620 --> 3:25:07.980]  the president, you got it, I declared it, you got it, I'm a nobody, I'm a little flunky
[3:25:07.980 --> 3:25:08.980]  freak.
[3:25:08.980 --> 3:25:11.340]  Yeah, that they've been putting into the system for years.
[3:25:11.340 --> 3:25:14.580]  Oh, you didn't know I went to school over there in Washington, D.C.
[3:25:14.580 --> 3:25:19.140]  Oh, you didn't know I was coming up here getting prepped and meeting with the Trump administration
[3:25:19.140 --> 3:25:25.300]  and a little Marco Rubio, yeah, I'm declaring that I'm the president of Venezuela, or I
[3:25:25.300 --> 3:25:31.740]  got to say it in the proper accent, which I'm not really good at doing.
[3:25:31.740 --> 3:25:41.500]  So suppose little Bernie Sanders came out, I declare myself president of America.
[3:25:41.500 --> 3:25:44.420]  I don't like what Trump is doing.
[3:25:44.420 --> 3:25:48.900]  And I got a bunch of nations behind me that hate him.
[3:25:48.900 --> 3:25:55.340]  And I want you to all get out into the streets and take over the government and put me in
[3:25:55.340 --> 3:25:57.580]  on the rightful God.
[3:25:57.580 --> 3:26:00.140]  You'd laugh at it.
[3:26:00.140 --> 3:26:07.020]  That's how sick a joke it is, but it's not a sick joke because all these sanctions are
[3:26:07.020 --> 3:26:11.140]  nothing more than wars against the people.
[3:26:11.140 --> 3:26:12.900]  They're the ones that suffer.
[3:26:12.900 --> 3:26:15.540]  The elite don't suffer from sanctions.
[3:26:15.540 --> 3:26:19.740]  It's economic warfare, just like bombing Dresden.
[3:26:19.740 --> 3:26:21.500]  You're bombing the people.
[3:26:21.500 --> 3:26:26.700]  Oh, yeah, but we're going to really make them angry and they're going to overthrow the government.
[3:26:26.700 --> 3:26:28.900]  You guys lose as failures.
[3:26:28.900 --> 3:26:33.540]  All you do is have a perfect track record of failure since World War II.
[3:26:33.540 --> 3:26:35.220]  And now you got another one.
[3:26:35.220 --> 3:26:39.660]  Hey, couldn't be about this sitting on the world's second largest, no, excuse me, the
[3:26:39.660 --> 3:26:42.620]  largest oil reserves in the world in Venezuela.
[3:26:42.620 --> 3:26:45.380]  No, it's their broccoli crops.
[3:26:45.380 --> 3:26:52.940]  Same reason we invaded Iraq and Libya, I tell you.
[3:26:52.940 --> 3:26:54.740]  Where's the outrage?
[3:26:54.740 --> 3:26:57.180]  No one's talking against this.
[3:26:57.180 --> 3:27:01.860]  The media, 100% behind it.
[3:27:01.860 --> 3:27:05.620]  All they keep bringing on are the flunkies, the prostitutes with misinformation.
[3:27:05.620 --> 3:27:09.140]  Ah, they had a fraudulent election.
[3:27:09.140 --> 3:27:10.740]  Oh, yeah.
[3:27:10.740 --> 3:27:14.980]  Did you know that Venezuela asked the United Nations to go down there and monitor it?
[3:27:14.980 --> 3:27:17.860]  And the United States vetoed it.
[3:27:17.860 --> 3:27:22.820]  And several countries and international groups went down there and monitored the Maduro elections
[3:27:22.820 --> 3:27:24.740]  last May when he won.
[3:27:24.740 --> 3:27:28.580]  The elections of Venezuela in Maduro won.
[3:27:28.580 --> 3:27:33.060]  And they said it was straight ahead.
[3:27:33.060 --> 3:27:35.060]  No fraud that they could find.
[3:27:35.060 --> 3:27:38.220]  It's in a trans journal.
[3:27:38.220 --> 3:27:41.500]  The new edition just came out.
[3:27:41.500 --> 3:27:48.900]  These are overview and facts and figures and data that are indisputable.
[3:27:48.900 --> 3:27:54.900]  If this war breaks out, which it looks like it's going to, you think you got a problem
[3:27:54.900 --> 3:28:00.900]  south of the border down Mexico way now, you haven't seen anything.
[3:28:00.900 --> 3:28:03.420]  The country in Venezuela is already in shambles.
[3:28:03.420 --> 3:28:06.940]  Three million people have left over the last few years.
[3:28:06.940 --> 3:28:09.180]  War breaks out in that region.
[3:28:09.180 --> 3:28:14.580]  They got enough weapons, a mass destruction down there to blow the joint apart from Colombia
[3:28:14.580 --> 3:28:19.260]  to Brazil to Venezuela and throughout the area.
[3:28:19.260 --> 3:28:27.260]  We will have a refugee and migrant crisis, a human wave that you won't believe.
[3:28:27.260 --> 3:28:31.900]  You better stop it now before it hits us hard.
[3:28:31.900 --> 3:28:53.420]  I'll be back in a few.
[3:28:53.420 --> 3:28:57.180]  Pain in my neck back and shoulders has really gotten worse.

[3:34:58.420 --> 3:35:05.060]  You know, I was talking before about the Venezuelan coup underway, and I get a kick
[3:35:05.060 --> 3:35:09.580]  out of all these liberals out there.
[3:35:09.580 --> 3:35:11.820]  Boy, do they love war.
[3:35:11.820 --> 3:35:18.220]  They forget that their Obama, the Nobel Peace Decree Prize winner, the lovely job he did
[3:35:18.220 --> 3:35:19.620]  over there in Libya.
[3:35:19.620 --> 3:35:23.300]  Oh, yeah, the richest country in Africa.
[3:35:23.300 --> 3:35:29.020]  People had more rights and better income and lifestyle living than anywhere else in the
[3:35:29.020 --> 3:35:30.020]  area.
[3:35:30.020 --> 3:35:36.500]  But, thanks to Obama, Hillary Clinton, Samantha Power, Susan Rice, Sarkozy of France, and
[3:35:36.500 --> 3:35:43.340]  little boy Cameron over there in the UK, oof, Gaddafi's gone, and now the place is totally
[3:35:43.340 --> 3:35:45.540]  destroyed a hellhole.
[3:35:45.540 --> 3:35:53.460]  Put the foundation for ISIS as well, and brought them in then to take over the government
[3:35:53.460 --> 3:35:54.620]  of Syria.
[3:35:54.620 --> 3:35:56.740]  But those are only facts.
[3:35:56.740 --> 3:36:01.900]  So the facts are that those Democrats are as crazy as those Republicans when it comes
[3:36:01.900 --> 3:36:04.140]  to war.
[3:36:04.140 --> 3:36:10.540]  And boy, do they support the coup going on now as being launched by the United States
[3:36:10.540 --> 3:36:12.820]  against Venezuela.
[3:36:12.820 --> 3:36:19.340]  That's right, that guy, Schiff, I think I'm spelling it right, I think Trump spells it
[3:36:19.340 --> 3:36:26.140]  more correctly than me, he got his shit, a T in it, and yeah, that guy, that liberal
[3:36:26.140 --> 3:36:31.620]  over there from Californe, oh, yeah, he's all in favor of the Obama throne.
[3:36:31.620 --> 3:36:39.260]  So through is that guy Dick Durbin, oh, I gotta be proper, maybe it's Penis Durbin,
[3:36:39.260 --> 3:36:45.900]  I don't want to be accused of calling him Dick Durbin, oh, it is Dick Durbin, okay, thank
[3:36:45.900 --> 3:36:46.900]  you.
[3:36:46.900 --> 3:36:53.820]  He's favor of it too, one after another, all of his liberals running out there for El Presidente
[3:36:53.820 --> 3:37:05.060]  of Los Estados and Enos on a Democratic ticket, silence on what's going on there in the United
[3:37:05.060 --> 3:37:06.860]  States rolling it.
[3:37:06.860 --> 3:37:11.940]  So moving on from there into something else, again, we just came out with our new trans
[3:37:11.940 --> 3:37:17.700]  journal and boy, there's history before it happens, oh, Venezuela, that was in our November
[3:37:17.700 --> 3:37:29.300]  trans journal, we warned of a triangle of death forming between Colombia, Brazil, and
[3:37:29.300 --> 3:37:34.660]  Argentina, the backing of the United States to take over the Venezuelan government coup.
[3:37:34.660 --> 3:37:40.180]  We wrote about that two months ago, anyway, again, talking about history before it happens,
[3:37:40.180 --> 3:37:47.940]  as you will know, on the marijuana front, we were way ahead of that, yeah, reefer money
[3:37:47.940 --> 3:37:55.260]  madness, over three years ago we wrote about that, was one of our top trends, and you can
[3:37:55.260 --> 3:38:00.100]  see where this is going, there's a whole lot of information in the trans journal about
[3:38:00.100 --> 3:38:01.600]  it.
[3:38:01.600 --> 3:38:08.580]  This is going to be one of the biggest businesses we've ever seen, trillion-dollar business worldwide.
[3:38:08.580 --> 3:38:20.860]  So I've been thinking about this, the criminals, the criminals who criminalized marijuana destroyed
[3:38:20.860 --> 3:38:28.620]  the lives of millions of people, tens of millions, and when you add the families that were destroyed
[3:38:28.620 --> 3:38:40.100]  into it over the decades, probably 100 million, the get-in-high-is-selling pot, and the brutality
[3:38:40.100 --> 3:38:50.780]  that the criminals used to beat up, lock up, and ruin the lives of the people could, selling
[3:38:50.780 --> 3:38:53.420]  pot was smoking it.
[3:38:53.420 --> 3:39:05.860]  The same criminal class that morons and imbeciles called Democrats and Republicans are now saying
[3:39:05.860 --> 3:39:08.860]  we're going to make it legal.
[3:39:08.860 --> 3:39:15.500]  They're not politicians, this is a gang, it's a mafia.
[3:39:15.500 --> 3:39:23.940]  The same low-lives like the one we have over here in New York, little Andy Cuomo, yeah,
[3:39:23.940 --> 3:39:32.100]  Mario's boy, like his son over there, other one, Chris Cuomo on CNN, the Cartoon News
[3:39:32.100 --> 3:39:38.260]  Network, guys born on third base and thought they had a home run.
[3:39:38.260 --> 3:39:46.260]  In March 2017, not ancient history, Cuomo's saying, no, we're not going to legalize it.
[3:39:46.260 --> 3:39:54.900]  Everybody knows that's as stupid and arrogant as I am, that marijuana is a gateway drug.
[3:39:54.900 --> 3:39:58.580]  That's the BSE spewed out, now they're legalizing it.
[3:39:58.580 --> 3:40:02.700]  The mafia is legalizing it, you know why?
[3:40:02.700 --> 3:40:04.460]  Because we're going to tax you.
[3:40:04.460 --> 3:40:09.060]  Yeah, we're going to call it tax, but it's our cut, you got it?
[3:40:09.060 --> 3:40:17.940]  So the same criminals, the same low-life criminals who criminalized it are now with their arrogance
[3:40:17.940 --> 3:40:21.420]  saying, hey, we're going to legalize it.
[3:40:21.420 --> 3:40:28.300]  And we're going to give you the laws on what you could do, what God gave you.
[3:40:28.300 --> 3:40:33.220]  This is God's plan, but we're taking it over.
[3:40:33.220 --> 3:40:39.460]  And we're going to tell you how you could sell it, how you could grow it, and how you
[3:40:39.460 --> 3:40:42.340]  could take it, where and when.
[3:40:42.340 --> 3:40:48.300]  And every time you do your SOB, you're going to give me my cut.
[3:40:48.300 --> 3:40:54.220]  And my cut's going to be bigger than your cut because I'm the mafia that morons and
[3:40:54.220 --> 3:40:59.300]  imbeciles call Democrats and Republicans.
[3:40:59.300 --> 3:41:06.900]  The same criminal gang, the same criminal gang that ruined the lives of tens of millions,
[3:41:06.900 --> 3:41:11.540]  if not hundreds of millions of people, are now coming out and saying, hey, we're legalizing
[3:41:11.540 --> 3:41:12.540]  it.
[3:41:12.540 --> 3:41:16.740]  And we're going to tell you what to do, and we're going to set up all of these bureaus
[3:41:16.740 --> 3:41:22.500]  and all of this other stuff so you could pay taxes and we're going to give you a license.
[3:41:22.500 --> 3:41:26.940]  So we could continue to live the lives we want to live because we're only going to make
[3:41:26.940 --> 3:41:31.260]  the rich people richer with this because the little people aren't going to be able to afford
[3:41:31.260 --> 3:41:32.260]  it.
[3:41:32.260 --> 3:41:35.740]  We're going to turn it into another monopoly.
[3:41:35.740 --> 3:41:40.060]  Where's the outrage?
[3:41:40.060 --> 3:41:47.780]  How dare these little low lives, and I've got to be equal here, men and women, black
[3:41:47.780 --> 3:41:58.980]  and white, name the religion, all of them, telling you to do what they want you to do
[3:41:58.980 --> 3:42:02.860]  with the plant that God gave you.
[3:42:02.860 --> 3:42:03.860]  That's right.
[3:42:03.860 --> 3:42:06.500]  They didn't make it.
[3:42:06.500 --> 3:42:08.500]  Not a Pfizer one.
[3:42:08.500 --> 3:42:10.780]  Not the cats that made opiates.
[3:42:10.780 --> 3:42:12.020]  No.
[3:42:12.020 --> 3:42:13.020]  This is from God.
[3:42:13.020 --> 3:42:17.580]  Hey, pretty soon they're going to tell me, hey, salinity, you can't grow those tomatoes
[3:42:17.580 --> 3:42:18.580]  anymore.
[3:42:18.580 --> 3:42:19.580]  Get rid of that basil.
[3:42:19.580 --> 3:42:20.580]  Yeah.
[3:42:20.580 --> 3:42:21.580]  No more zucchini.
[3:42:21.580 --> 3:42:23.580]  We'll tell you what to do.
[3:42:23.580 --> 3:42:26.380]  Don't you know who we are?
[3:42:26.380 --> 3:42:35.700]  We're the criminal gang that morons and imbeciles call Republicans and Democrats.
[3:42:35.700 --> 3:42:40.780]  You got to stop this before they rob us of every penny we have.
[3:42:40.780 --> 3:42:41.780]  Be back in a minute.
[3:42:41.780 --> 3:43:02.620]  We'll see you in a minute or two.
[3:43:02.620 --> 3:43:09.060]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best selling supplement family in the world is
[3:43:09.060 --> 3:43:11.060]  energy drinks and energy supplements.
[3:43:11.060 --> 3:43:16.900]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals
[3:43:16.900 --> 3:43:21.060]  that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side
[3:43:21.060 --> 3:43:22.060]  effects.
[3:43:22.060 --> 3:43:28.260]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout
[3:43:28.260 --> 3:43:31.140]  and beyond system in the world.
[3:43:31.140 --> 3:43:32.620]  There's nothing else like it.
[3:43:32.620 --> 3:43:33.620]  You must experience it.
[3:43:33.620 --> 3:43:38.620]  It is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use, packaged, mixed with fruit juice
[3:43:38.620 --> 3:43:40.780]  or water, whatever you'd like.
[3:43:40.780 --> 3:43:44.700]  Even though it's very, very strong, it lasts up to 10 hours, so take a half pack the first
[3:43:44.700 --> 3:43:50.420]  time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.

[3:46:57.940 --> 3:47:15.660]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:15.660 --> 3:47:21.340]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[3:47:21.340 --> 3:47:25.980]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:25.980 --> 3:47:33.580]  He rode a blazing saddle, he wore a shiny star.
[3:47:33.580 --> 3:47:40.180]  His jobs were for battle, two bad men near and far.
[3:47:40.180 --> 3:47:45.700]  So ladies and gentlemen, the final segment of the Alex Jones show, we've got Roger Stone
[3:47:45.700 --> 3:47:47.660]  in Dited by Muller a week and a half ago.
[3:47:47.660 --> 3:47:52.820]  We've got Gerald Salente, the Trump trans forecaster, and I appreciate Roger popping in
[3:47:52.820 --> 3:47:56.260]  about 30 minutes ago when Gerald was taking over.
[3:47:56.260 --> 3:47:59.940]  I got word of this from Roger, he was in the cover of the war room and I said, no, Gerald
[3:47:59.940 --> 3:48:05.340]  Salente is the best-selling author, former consultant, lobbyist like Roger, he'll want
[3:48:05.340 --> 3:48:06.340]  to comment too.
[3:48:06.340 --> 3:48:11.500]  This is Grant J. Smith, attorney at law for Roger Stone, document cam shot, please for
[3:48:11.500 --> 3:48:13.140]  TV viewers.
[3:48:13.140 --> 3:48:16.620]  Major breaking news here today, not just breaking Gavin McGinnis' suit that Dredge
[3:48:16.620 --> 3:48:22.900]  reports linked to first on the situation with the Southern Private Law Center, but specific
[3:48:22.900 --> 3:48:32.340]  evidence with the time coding that lawyers got that CNN got word of the indictment before
[3:48:32.340 --> 3:48:34.580]  the lawyers for Roger Stone.
[3:48:34.580 --> 3:48:41.460]  That is illegal, that is a major jurisprudence violation in many areas, a felony.
[3:48:41.460 --> 3:48:48.340]  So we've got the metadata, we've got the indictment, we've got it all right here, we're going
[3:48:48.340 --> 3:48:55.380]  to be going over this, but this is absolutely huge, global exclusive, we've got Roger's
[3:48:55.380 --> 3:49:00.660]  neighbors confirming CNN was setting up 30 minutes before, we've got Senator Graham launching
[3:49:00.660 --> 3:49:01.660]  an investigation.
[3:49:01.660 --> 3:49:04.740]  Roger, this is a big deal.
[3:49:04.740 --> 3:49:12.420]  Well, Alex, you're absolutely right, this is indisputable proof that a CNN producer
[3:49:12.420 --> 3:49:21.020]  was sent a draft copy of my indictment, which was sealed a day prior to my address.
[3:49:21.020 --> 3:49:28.300]  Leaks by the special counsel's office to the media or anyone are specifically illegal.
[3:49:28.300 --> 3:49:33.860]  This is not the document that was put up on PACER and unsealed by the government after
[3:49:33.860 --> 3:49:40.420]  my arrest, this is proven by the metadata tags to be a draft of my indictment that was
[3:49:40.420 --> 3:49:49.340]  sent to CNN, explaining why they arrived at my home roughly 50 minutes before I was arrested.
[3:49:49.340 --> 3:49:54.220]  That has to be the shortest stakeout in American history.
[3:49:54.220 --> 3:49:59.860]  This I think destroys the idea that they were operating on a hunch.
[3:49:59.860 --> 3:50:05.420]  My lawyers figured this out this morning, and they have forwarded this information to
[3:50:05.420 --> 3:50:12.440]  Senator Graham, to Congressman Mark Meadows, to Congressman Jim Jordan, to Congressman
[3:50:12.440 --> 3:50:17.280]  Matt Gaetz, members of the House Judiciary Committee.
[3:50:17.280 --> 3:50:24.300]  This I think indisputably proves what I said last week, that CNN was allowed to film the
[3:50:24.300 --> 3:50:30.940]  public humiliation of not only Roger Stone, but my 71-year-old wife, who is charged with
[3:50:30.940 --> 3:50:36.980]  no crime whatsoever, but made to stand in the street barefooted in her nightgown after
[3:50:36.980 --> 3:50:41.060]  this stunning pre-dawn raid on my house.
[3:50:41.060 --> 3:50:43.540]  CNN is busted.
[3:50:43.540 --> 3:50:45.820]  There is no question about this.
[3:50:45.820 --> 3:50:48.460]  Prior to this, it was an allegation.
[3:50:48.460 --> 3:50:53.900]  I think this absolutely proves that there has been a violation of the law.
[3:50:53.900 --> 3:50:57.180]  Let me bring Gerald Salente in here, and you'll be obviously back on the war room to cover
[3:50:57.180 --> 3:50:58.680]  this more.
[3:50:58.680 --> 3:51:04.300]  This fits into the sloppiness where we have all these different FBI agents saying it's
[3:51:04.300 --> 3:51:10.220]  an insurance policy, let's set him up, let's illegally spy, Hillary's really my president,
[3:51:10.220 --> 3:51:14.980]  and then lying to Congress and lying to the president and lying to the courts saying that
[3:51:14.980 --> 3:51:18.780]  the president wasn't the target of an espionage investigation, which they later admitted.
[3:51:18.780 --> 3:51:20.100]  They committed perjury.
[3:51:20.100 --> 3:51:27.940]  The thing you're charged with, this is sensationally obvious, and now there's such slops that
[3:51:27.940 --> 3:51:33.940]  they send you the metadata that a day before they illegally send a sealed indictment to
[3:51:33.940 --> 3:51:34.940]  CNN.
[3:51:34.940 --> 3:51:39.420]  I'll go back to you in a moment, Roger, but Gerald Salente, this is exactly what you've
[3:51:39.420 --> 3:51:40.420]  been talking about.
[3:51:40.420 --> 3:51:47.860]  Yes, there is no media anymore, as I say, these are just their prostitutes.
[3:51:47.860 --> 3:51:53.700]  They get paid to put out by their corporate johns and Washington whoremasters, and there
[3:51:53.700 --> 3:51:57.100]  can't be any clearer evidence than this.
[3:51:57.100 --> 3:52:01.660]  The whole Roger Stone indictment was nothing more than a Trump attack.
[3:52:01.660 --> 3:52:06.620]  And I could take the words that you would never believe where they come from, but the
[3:52:06.620 --> 3:52:18.420]  world socialist website, WS, WS, this was their headline story in January 30th.
[3:52:18.420 --> 3:52:25.180]  Stone indictment presents no evidence of links between WikiLeaks and Trump campaign.
[3:52:25.180 --> 3:52:29.260]  Remember, this is the world socialist website.
[3:52:29.260 --> 3:52:34.700]  They broke down the story and said, what a sham this whole thing is, and they're no
[3:52:34.700 --> 3:52:40.500]  Trump fans, but they're trying to be fair in what they're saying, and how this whole
[3:52:40.500 --> 3:52:46.060]  thing was a staged event to discredit the Trump administration, just as they've been
[3:52:46.060 --> 3:52:48.420]  doing since the first day he got away.
[3:52:48.420 --> 3:52:49.420]  That's right.
[3:52:49.420 --> 3:52:51.740]  So, Roger, thank you for breaking this huge exclusive here.
[3:52:51.740 --> 3:52:54.220]  They'll be covering more on the War Room at StoneColdTruth.com.
[3:52:54.220 --> 3:52:55.740]  We'll post this immediately.
[3:52:55.740 --> 3:53:01.580]  I'm sure Roger's going to link to it, but holy Toledo, I mean, this is getting insane.
[3:53:01.580 --> 3:53:06.980]  Why would they publicly put the date stamp on it, send it to CNN, which is a felony,
[3:53:06.980 --> 3:53:09.540]  to leak a sealed indictment, and have the reporter out there?
[3:53:09.540 --> 3:53:13.580]  It just shows a brazen disregard for anything.
[3:53:13.580 --> 3:53:16.820]  These people have more hutspa than I've ever heard of.
[3:53:16.820 --> 3:53:22.060]  Well, perhaps this was an error, but if so, it was a fatal error.
[3:53:22.060 --> 3:53:26.860]  They, as you know, executed a search warrant on my home.
[3:53:26.860 --> 3:53:32.940]  The leak of a search warrant is a very specific crime, because if the person who was being
[3:53:32.940 --> 3:53:37.620]  searched learned about it in advance, they would have the opportunity to destroy evidence
[3:53:37.620 --> 3:53:42.380]  or tamper with it, something I have not done and have never done.
[3:53:42.380 --> 3:53:50.500]  But if I was supposedly dangerous, which is the premise of a 29-member strike force in
[3:53:50.500 --> 3:53:57.820]  SWAT gear, brandishing assault rifles surrounding my home to arrest me, then why was CNN allowed
[3:53:57.820 --> 3:53:59.060]  to film it?
[3:53:59.060 --> 3:54:05.020]  And they put this fellow short tail out front, but the producer on the ground is Josh Campbell,
[3:54:05.020 --> 3:54:10.500]  the former special assistant FBI director, James Comey, and a long time FBI employee.
[3:54:10.500 --> 3:54:12.100]  It must be clear, they blocked the road off.
[3:54:12.100 --> 3:54:14.100]  This guy's right in the middle of him, Gerald Salente.
[3:54:14.100 --> 3:54:17.500]  I mean, again, this level of arrogance, what do you call this, Gerald?
[3:54:17.500 --> 3:54:23.260]  Oh, it's fascism, I mean, that's all this is, it's a takeover.
[3:54:23.260 --> 3:54:25.940]  It's the merger of state and corporate powers.
[3:54:25.940 --> 3:54:28.060]  And they just could not be any clearer than this.
[3:54:28.060 --> 3:54:33.420]  This is disgusting what they've done, the humiliation and the arrogance of these people
[3:54:33.420 --> 3:54:36.460]  being these tough guys all dressed up in their SWAT gear.
[3:54:36.460 --> 3:54:39.620]  And I agree with you, but how did they not know it would blow up in their face?
[3:54:39.620 --> 3:54:47.060]  It's that blindness, it's that tone deafness, like, didn't they get, this didn't look good?
[3:54:47.060 --> 3:54:53.620]  Yeah, it's just disgusting, again, let's go worldwide on it.
[3:54:53.620 --> 3:54:57.260]  Look what they're doing to the people in France.
[3:54:57.260 --> 3:55:02.940]  These crazy guys get all power hungry, and then they become these mercenaries for these
[3:55:02.940 --> 3:55:06.140]  crazy people that are hiring them.
[3:55:06.140 --> 3:55:10.940]  And that's all this is, to hear that there was a former guy working for the FBI, that's
[3:55:10.940 --> 3:55:12.980]  also now with CNN.
[3:55:12.980 --> 3:55:14.420]  How much more proof did you need?
[3:55:14.420 --> 3:55:17.860]  That was a shocking statement when I just heard it.
[3:55:17.860 --> 3:55:18.860]  It's confirmed.
[3:55:18.860 --> 3:55:21.980]  All right, Gerald, thank you for all the great work you do.
[3:55:21.980 --> 3:55:24.220]  Please join us anytime you want.
[3:55:24.220 --> 3:55:25.220]  Trendsresearch.com.
[3:55:25.220 --> 3:55:30.420]  I know, Roger, when are you going to be on the war room next hour, Roger?
[3:55:30.420 --> 3:55:35.540]  We'll be on the war room at four o'clock central, five o'clock Eastern to break this
[3:55:35.540 --> 3:55:36.540]  down.
[3:55:36.540 --> 3:55:42.020]  I mean, Alex, the irony of this, of course, is that the judge is considering gagging me
[3:55:42.020 --> 3:55:45.380]  because they don't want to poison the jury pool.
[3:55:45.380 --> 3:55:49.540]  But this raid on my house poisoned the jury pool.
[3:55:49.540 --> 3:55:50.700]  That's perfectly all right.
[3:55:50.700 --> 3:55:56.900]  This leak to CNN made me look like public enemy number one, like some kind of drug kingpin,
[3:55:56.900 --> 3:56:01.900]  despite the fact that I'm charged with nonviolent process crimes that allegedly took place.
[3:56:01.900 --> 3:56:06.540]  So let me ask you this, any word on when they may gag you?
[3:56:06.540 --> 3:56:12.300]  Well, the judge has required submissions from both the government, my attorneys by, I think
[3:56:12.300 --> 3:56:16.620]  it is the fifth, and imagine there'll be a decision after that.
[3:56:16.620 --> 3:56:22.780]  So it's ironic, the government is trying to paint me as public enemy number one, yet
[3:56:22.780 --> 3:56:27.500]  they're afraid that my defending myself and raising the money to defend myself, well,
[3:56:27.500 --> 3:56:28.740]  that will poison the jury.
[3:56:28.740 --> 3:56:32.380]  Oh, I forgot this judge already barred one person from raising money for the defense.
[3:56:32.380 --> 3:56:33.380]  Incredible.
[3:56:33.380 --> 3:56:35.780]  Roger will talk to you in one hour, one hour into the war room.
[3:56:35.780 --> 3:56:39.860]  This is not the American we're supposed to be in, is it?
[3:56:39.860 --> 3:56:42.060]  No, it's disgusting what's going on.
[3:56:42.060 --> 3:56:43.420]  How could they do that?
[3:56:43.420 --> 3:56:46.100]  And how come there's no outrage about this?
[3:56:46.100 --> 3:56:49.060]  This is what they did to Roger Stone.
[3:56:49.060 --> 3:56:51.940]  And this is a man of, you know, well renowned.
[3:56:51.940 --> 3:56:53.940]  And again, he's no criminal here.
[3:56:53.940 --> 3:56:55.500]  Look what they're doing to other people too.
[3:56:55.500 --> 3:57:00.140]  No wonder why so many homes are broken into and innocent people are being killed.
[3:57:00.140 --> 3:57:03.380]  And with all this kind of madness, this has to stop.
[3:57:03.380 --> 3:57:06.180]  This isn't what this country is about.
[3:57:06.180 --> 3:57:07.180]  Wow.
[3:57:07.180 --> 3:57:08.180]  Okay.
