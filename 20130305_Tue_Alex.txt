[00:00.000 --> 00:12.480]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.480 --> 00:21.240]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:21.240 --> 00:32.160]  and good morning or good afternoon depending on where you're located
[00:32.160 --> 00:37.680]  catrin albert here with you filling in as a guest host for alex jones and a
[00:37.680 --> 00:41.560]  much needed vacation let's hope he can get that blood pressure down we need him
[00:41.560 --> 00:45.960]  tanned rested and ready to continue to lead the revolution so i'm filling in
[00:45.960 --> 00:50.760]  for him and yesterday today and friday happy to be here with you and we've got
[00:50.760 --> 00:56.400]  a ton of really hot news going on right now you know there's one place on the
[00:56.400 --> 01:01.040]  globe that i gotta say makes pretty much every other place on the globe look
[01:01.040 --> 01:06.160]  like a caribbean vacation and that place would be north korea no matter what
[01:06.160 --> 01:09.160]  else you want to say i mean you got it in in some ways you got to kind of stand
[01:09.160 --> 01:13.320]  back and go you know it is kind of impressive i suppose that north korea
[01:13.320 --> 01:18.000]  has managed to maintain its position sort of outside of the circle of u.s.
[01:18.000 --> 01:23.840]  influence but it's done so in such a horrific way for its people that you've
[01:23.840 --> 01:27.440]  really got to kind of a shutter go down your spine when you think about that
[01:27.440 --> 01:32.200]  country if you think about all of the worst regimes of history and then you
[01:32.200 --> 01:36.560]  kind of multiply them all together and stick them into the 21st century but i
[01:36.560 --> 01:40.000]  guess make it seem as other people were living a hundred years before then then
[01:40.000 --> 01:45.160]  you got north korea freezing cold not enough food to go around absolutely
[01:45.160 --> 01:50.120]  horrific communist dictator one of the few remaining places on earth it still
[01:50.120 --> 01:55.280]  hasn't quite figured out that full-scale communism leads to starvation and
[01:55.280 --> 01:58.680]  misery on the part of people or if they have figured it out i guess i guess they
[01:58.680 --> 02:02.680]  don't care but north korea is really you know when you when you think about like
[02:02.680 --> 02:07.320]  burma i mean there are some places on on the globe you just go ill
[02:07.320 --> 02:11.000]  yeah and sad north korea certainly is one of them well north korea has been in
[02:11.000 --> 02:16.600]  the news weirdly for actually the last couple of months and this hour i'm gonna
[02:16.600 --> 02:21.840]  be talking about dennis rodman's recent trip along with the ball things three of
[02:21.840 --> 02:25.160]  the harlem globetrotters anybody old enough to remember those guys are they
[02:25.160 --> 02:29.120]  still in a round early geriatrically bouncing basketballs in their seventies
[02:29.120 --> 02:34.640]  now i don't know but uh... they had it with jenice rodman off to north korea
[02:34.640 --> 02:40.160]  the behind what i think even goes beyond the iron bamboo curtain into the
[02:40.160 --> 02:45.320]  absolute heart of sheer human misery itself there they were so i'll be giving
[02:45.320 --> 02:47.520]  you the details on that
[02:47.520 --> 02:52.760]  and also in some other recent famous americans who've been heading off to north
[02:52.760 --> 02:53.680]  korea
[02:53.680 --> 02:57.600]  north korea of course uh... more than happy to accept that kind of
[02:57.600 --> 02:59.120]  international attention
[02:59.120 --> 03:02.560]  north korea seems to uh... really thrive on
[03:02.560 --> 03:08.080]  doing the big theatrical performances you guys seen the videos on youtube
[03:08.080 --> 03:12.640]  every it seems like every year on the birthday of the great leader or some of
[03:12.640 --> 03:15.800]  their national holiday they have all of their
[03:15.800 --> 03:19.200]  soldiers come out all the men in the women and they march in unison and they
[03:19.200 --> 03:22.520]  hold up these big cards and they have the beautiful women in their flower
[03:22.520 --> 03:26.360]  dresses dancing around in their in their lovely colors and
[03:26.360 --> 03:30.160]  really make it seem like it's just is just a wonderland it's just a paradise
[03:30.160 --> 03:32.920]  but what they don't show you is behind the scenes
[03:32.920 --> 03:35.760]  you know they did the same thing for kathryn the great when she would travel
[03:35.760 --> 03:36.920]  through russia
[03:36.920 --> 03:39.040]  as they do for these visiting
[03:39.040 --> 03:41.160]  uh... international
[03:41.160 --> 03:43.800]  representatives who go there with film cameras
[03:43.800 --> 03:48.840]  they used to set up in kathryn uh... for kathryn the great's visits in these
[03:48.840 --> 03:51.280]  terribly destitute villages
[03:51.280 --> 03:53.080]  they would set up false fronts
[03:53.080 --> 03:57.160]  so that as she would ride down the street in her cavalcade or whatever it
[03:57.160 --> 03:59.540]  was her gold gilded carriage
[03:59.540 --> 04:01.440]  that on both sides of the street
[04:01.440 --> 04:05.920]  would be these opulent homes in these happy well-dressed smiling children
[04:05.920 --> 04:09.160]  wearing neatly ironed rocks and pineafores and everyone would be
[04:09.160 --> 04:10.800]  smiling and well-fed
[04:10.800 --> 04:14.520]  and what they didn't know is that they spent a fortune building up literally
[04:14.520 --> 04:16.160]  just the facade
[04:16.160 --> 04:17.400]  for her
[04:17.400 --> 04:20.680]  and the visiting foreign dictators and if you just peeled that away was almost
[04:20.680 --> 04:22.320]  like that the wild west
[04:22.320 --> 04:25.680]  where they have those those fake front the false front buildings you see the
[04:25.680 --> 04:26.840]  old westerns
[04:26.840 --> 04:29.440]  where if you looked behind it you would see the
[04:29.440 --> 04:32.840]  misery the the human misery in those villages same thing true in north
[04:32.840 --> 04:33.960]  korea
[04:33.960 --> 04:38.160]  where literally hundreds of thousands potentially even millions of people of
[04:38.160 --> 04:41.640]  starved to death because of their terrible communist policies
[04:41.640 --> 04:44.560]  and yet we've got u.s uh... celebrities
[04:44.560 --> 04:47.680]  i suppose if you want to call denise rodman a celebrity
[04:47.680 --> 04:51.240]  uh... just trying to write that uh... you know right right the horror we all
[04:51.240 --> 04:52.440]  feel about north korea
[04:52.440 --> 04:54.800]  all right i'll give you details on that when we come back right after this

[08:41.800 --> 08:45.960]  Catherine Albertier filling in for alex jones the alpha dog of the freedom
[08:45.960 --> 08:49.240]  movement so glad that he's on our team i gotta tell you
[08:49.240 --> 08:52.480]  uh... you know after seeing him on pierce morgan and we're gonna be covering a
[08:52.480 --> 08:56.240]  clip here shortly of uh... louis ferrican responding to that but you know
[08:56.240 --> 08:58.440]  after seeing alex jones and pierce morgan
[08:58.440 --> 09:01.800]  i'd say i i think i have the reaction everybody did when we first thought which
[09:01.800 --> 09:04.880]  was oh my gosh i can't believe i'm seeing that
[09:04.880 --> 09:06.840]  on live network television
[09:06.840 --> 09:11.960]  and i think uh... you know the the aftermath i gotta tell you i am so glad
[09:11.960 --> 09:13.680]  that guy is on our team
[09:13.680 --> 09:17.960]  seriously which would you want to be on the opposite team of all of that energy
[09:17.960 --> 09:22.360]  and the thing about alex jones is that that energy represents the energy of
[09:22.360 --> 09:25.120]  literally millions of listeners across this country
[09:25.120 --> 09:29.080]  that is the energy on which this country was founded that independent energy
[09:29.080 --> 09:30.680]  that says heck no
[09:30.680 --> 09:35.480]  people who descended from the ancestors who said heck no
[09:35.480 --> 09:36.360]  to
[09:36.360 --> 09:39.960]  it did to even a greater extent than i think we can even imagine today
[09:39.960 --> 09:43.120]  if you think about what this country was founded on
[09:43.120 --> 09:47.240]  people who got so sick of the power structure as it currently stood that
[09:47.240 --> 09:49.680]  they were willing to brave oceans
[09:49.680 --> 09:55.160]  and privation and deprivation and starvation and uh... they having to
[09:55.160 --> 09:58.800]  to figure out how to hack their way through an entirely new continent
[09:58.800 --> 10:01.560]  because they were so fed up with the power structure
[10:01.560 --> 10:05.160]  and i gotta tell you that is the blood that flows in the veins of true american
[10:05.160 --> 10:08.600]  patriots that is the blood that flows in my veins in your veins when you think
[10:08.600 --> 10:09.520]  about
[10:09.520 --> 10:14.360]  our ancestors who laughed whatever hellhole they were in whether it was in
[10:14.360 --> 10:18.280]  eastern europe western europe southern europe africa
[10:18.280 --> 10:21.960]  well that's a whole other story there isn't it uh... france
[10:21.960 --> 10:26.080]  you gotta talk about northern europe you gotta talk about mexico you gotta talk
[10:26.080 --> 10:28.680]  about uh... all through south america
[10:28.680 --> 10:33.680]  we've got people who through one means or another came to this country and had
[10:33.680 --> 10:35.160]  to carve out a life
[10:35.160 --> 10:38.920]  and when you look at how they managed to pull that off and especially
[10:38.920 --> 10:43.600]  you know those folks who left family left homes left everything that they had
[10:43.600 --> 10:45.200]  everything that they knew
[10:45.200 --> 10:49.000]  and came out here to say it's worth it to me to strike out on my own i gotta tell
[10:49.000 --> 10:50.240]  you that's uh...
[10:50.240 --> 10:54.160]  that's a proud heritage yeah and thinking about what it is to be truly in
[10:54.160 --> 10:57.040]  american in this country in this day and age
[10:57.040 --> 10:59.720]  and then take a look at what's happening in other parts of the world where
[10:59.720 --> 11:03.040]  people don't have even a fraction of the freedoms that we have
[11:03.040 --> 11:06.360]  i've got a remind everybody listening the next time you want to brag on the
[11:06.360 --> 11:07.560]  u.s of a
[11:07.560 --> 11:10.960]  and believe me it's it's pretty easy to do this list of going wrong here
[11:10.960 --> 11:13.560]  but the next time you want to do that i want you to remember something i've
[11:13.560 --> 11:15.440]  traveled all over this world
[11:15.440 --> 11:18.400]  and i know alex has done a considerable amount of traveling as well i've
[11:18.400 --> 11:20.720]  lived in mexico i've lived in japan
[11:20.720 --> 11:24.800]  i have been uh... to thailand's i've been all over this
[11:24.800 --> 11:26.080]  this this globe
[11:26.080 --> 11:29.680]  and i gotta tell you whenever i come home i want to kiss the ground
[11:29.680 --> 11:34.040]  i really do because this is the only place where people truly i think even
[11:34.040 --> 11:37.760]  in in in the core of their being on the cellular level
[11:37.760 --> 11:41.520]  understand what it is to be free and independent and not to be under the
[11:41.520 --> 11:42.480]  thumb
[11:42.480 --> 11:46.720]  of somebody else and so we've got that heritage leaving these these oppressive
[11:46.720 --> 11:51.240]  hill holes that our ancestors left for a variety of different reasons
[11:51.240 --> 11:56.080]  and coming over here and then even once we got here our ancestors had to stand
[11:56.080 --> 11:57.160]  up and do it again
[11:57.160 --> 11:58.800]  hey you british uh...
[11:58.800 --> 11:59.760]  no no no
[11:59.760 --> 12:01.960]  the whole reason we left in the first place
[12:01.960 --> 12:04.480]  was we didn't want to be dealing with folks like you
[12:04.480 --> 12:09.440]  so you know when i see people like alex jones standing up on pierce morgan
[12:09.440 --> 12:13.360]  uh... on that's on that television program and saying heck no you you can't
[12:13.360 --> 12:14.520]  it's not going to work
[12:14.520 --> 12:16.880]  i gotta tell you if you know
[12:16.880 --> 12:20.840]  it may just be proud really it does to know that i live in a country where
[12:20.840 --> 12:22.360]  special as a woman
[12:22.360 --> 12:24.680]  where they're where men are real men
[12:24.680 --> 12:27.200]  and men are willing to stand up for what's right
[12:27.200 --> 12:31.960]  and i'm certainly as a you know bible believing weird on my sleeve christian
[12:31.960 --> 12:35.600]  i'm absolutely a believer in praying for my enemies and turning the other cheek
[12:35.600 --> 12:37.280]  and doing all of that too
[12:37.280 --> 12:39.960]  but i also know that during world war two
[12:39.960 --> 12:43.720]  when the jews said oh yeah look how harmless we are take our guns go ahead
[12:43.720 --> 12:46.640]  look we're harmless see don't hurt us
[12:46.640 --> 12:50.600]  but that attitude in that approach doesn't work
[12:50.600 --> 12:52.800]  so the only thing those folks understand
[12:52.800 --> 12:54.520]  the only thing that the nazis understood
[12:54.520 --> 12:56.580]  was sheer brute force
[12:56.580 --> 12:59.520]  and that doesn't mean you initiated against them but it certainly means that
[12:59.520 --> 13:01.360]  you show them
[13:01.360 --> 13:04.200]  that they cannot initiate force against you
[13:04.200 --> 13:05.760]  without a fight
[13:05.760 --> 13:09.800]  so i think that's uh... really really an important position you you uh... i i
[13:09.800 --> 13:13.000]  think they do a good job here in new Hampshire i live in the free state
[13:13.000 --> 13:15.800]  part of the free state project check it out if you haven't already done so
[13:15.800 --> 13:17.680]  liberty in our lifetime
[13:17.680 --> 13:21.400]  thousands of people moving to new hampshire to try to set up a free
[13:21.400 --> 13:22.960]  society right here
[13:22.960 --> 13:26.440]  and the symbol of the free state project is the porcupine
[13:26.440 --> 13:30.280]  and i like it because a porcupine and i we have them i've actually saw one in
[13:30.280 --> 13:34.440]  our local woods he scurried up a tree when i walked past with my dog
[13:34.440 --> 13:37.760]  the little porcupine is the one that's with us you know he saw my dog he didn't
[13:37.760 --> 13:41.920]  say oh yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna kick your rear end he said you know it's a dog
[13:41.920 --> 13:43.680]  i'm just gonna book it up this tree
[13:43.680 --> 13:45.080]  leave me alone
[13:45.080 --> 13:48.360]  and yet i'll tell you this if he couldn't have gotten up the tree and my dog
[13:48.360 --> 13:52.280]  would have come at him my dog would have been the worst in that encounter
[13:52.280 --> 13:54.960]  so the porcupine is a great symbol
[13:54.960 --> 14:00.080]  kinda like the don't tread on me snake you know it it sends a strong message
[14:00.080 --> 14:01.880]  of i don't want to be messed with
[14:01.880 --> 14:04.600]  but if you mess with me it's not gonna go well with you
[14:04.600 --> 14:07.720]  and i think that's really the the core fundamental message
[14:07.720 --> 14:11.520]  so now let's talk about uh... the u.s. in contrast to some of the other countries
[14:11.520 --> 14:12.320]  out there
[14:12.320 --> 14:15.760]  and there's one country that has been in the news pretty considerably in the
[14:15.760 --> 14:18.360]  last couple months and that is north korea
[14:18.360 --> 14:22.960]  you know we just uh... we just had a regime change over there not much of one
[14:22.960 --> 14:24.520]  uh... kim jong-il
[14:24.520 --> 14:29.300]  passed away his son now kim jong-un you know moon-faced uh... kim jong-un
[14:29.300 --> 14:32.440]  the uh... the one that the onion parodied
[14:32.440 --> 14:33.740]  is having one
[14:33.740 --> 14:38.480]  the time magazine sexiest man of the year yeah he's about as unsexy as they
[14:38.480 --> 14:39.840]  get to put
[14:39.840 --> 14:43.640]  but the uh... chinese newspaper by the way the people's republic of china
[14:43.640 --> 14:44.680]  newspaper
[14:44.680 --> 14:48.040]  actually bought that hook line and sinker and and printed this breathless
[14:48.040 --> 14:51.720]  review that kim jong-un had been voted sexiest man of the year until they
[14:51.720 --> 14:53.440]  realized they've been had
[14:53.440 --> 14:56.360]  totally snookered by the onion kind of a fun story there
[14:56.360 --> 14:59.840]  but uh... yeah kim jong-un who you know we were still trying to kind of figure
[14:59.840 --> 15:01.560]  out what's up with that guy
[15:01.560 --> 15:06.000]  you know he seems he's got this big kind of kind of baby face and uh... doesn't
[15:06.000 --> 15:11.480]  smile very often and looks like he's been kind of i don't know how to put it
[15:11.480 --> 15:15.440]  maybe a little over sheltered by his dad will see how all that turns out but he
[15:15.440 --> 15:18.320]  runs one of the most brutal dictatorships
[15:18.320 --> 15:19.600]  on the face
[15:19.600 --> 15:22.160]  of the globe and that would be north korea
[15:22.160 --> 15:26.240]  so when you think about north korea you have to think about freezing cold
[15:26.240 --> 15:29.060]  it's extraordinarily cold up there especially in the winter time is like
[15:29.060 --> 15:32.160]  fifteen twenty thirty below so it's really cold
[15:32.160 --> 15:34.520]  it is also really poor
[15:34.520 --> 15:38.320]  and when i say really poor they don't have any of the advantages
[15:38.320 --> 15:41.200]  of a functional free market
[15:41.200 --> 15:44.960]  so if you go up to north korea not that you could get in because it is a
[15:44.960 --> 15:46.160]  militarized
[15:46.160 --> 15:47.760]  uh... zone with all the
[15:47.760 --> 15:51.040]  the borders closed down with uh... you know well armed
[15:51.040 --> 15:54.920]  uh... that's the one thing they do spend money on is is on their military
[15:54.920 --> 15:58.360]  you can't get into north korea unless you're famous
[15:58.360 --> 16:02.720]  or unless you uh... wind up getting arrested somehow uh... you know near the
[16:02.720 --> 16:06.120]  border so north korea is not a place a lot of people get to go
[16:06.120 --> 16:09.280]  however north korea seems to be really
[16:09.280 --> 16:12.640]  and how they call it almost like trying to
[16:12.640 --> 16:15.760]  uh... trying to get international attention
[16:15.760 --> 16:20.600]  for itself in a variety of rather bizarre ways you can go online and my
[16:20.600 --> 16:22.760]  favorite also i can find this
[16:22.760 --> 16:26.080]  uh... there's uh... an absolutely hilarious video where somebody put some
[16:26.080 --> 16:27.400]  great music
[16:27.400 --> 16:31.440]  to the marching of all of their military which they do every year
[16:31.440 --> 16:34.960]  at these huge get-togethers where they have uh... you know thousands of kids
[16:34.960 --> 16:37.040]  come out in thousands of women
[16:37.040 --> 16:40.760]  in their brightly colored traditional dress dancing around in thousands of
[16:40.760 --> 16:42.680]  soldiers marching in the street
[16:42.680 --> 16:46.040]  and they march down the street with their with their bombs in their weapons
[16:46.040 --> 16:49.120]  and really make a show of it make it seem like north korea
[16:49.120 --> 16:51.360]  is a success the reality though
[16:51.360 --> 16:54.120]  north korea is the biggest failure
[16:54.120 --> 16:55.600]  on planet earth
[16:55.600 --> 16:57.800]  the biggest failure let me tell you right now
[16:57.800 --> 17:01.120]  total deaths in north korea this is between nineteen ninety four nineteen
[17:01.120 --> 17:02.600]  ninety eight
[17:02.600 --> 17:06.080]  during their uh... which is one of their families due to economic
[17:06.080 --> 17:07.700]  mismanagement
[17:07.700 --> 17:12.400]  and natural disasters they lost what some estimates is up to three point five
[17:12.400 --> 17:13.920]  million members
[17:13.920 --> 17:16.640]  of their population to literal starvation
[17:16.640 --> 17:21.120]  people reduced eating the bark on trees people reduced eating grass
[17:21.120 --> 17:24.040]  and yet whenever somebody from the west goes out there with a camera
[17:24.040 --> 17:28.920]  they set up these potemkin villages of potemkin village you can start page at
[17:28.920 --> 17:29.800]  look it up
[17:29.800 --> 17:33.920]  is what they set up in uh... uh... the former russia
[17:33.920 --> 17:35.840]  or actually back in russia
[17:35.840 --> 17:38.040]  uh... the potemkin villages
[17:38.040 --> 17:42.560]  were these fake villages designed to impress foreign dignitaries and
[17:42.560 --> 17:44.960]  especially kathryn the great
[17:44.960 --> 17:47.520]  uh... during her visit to cry mea
[17:47.520 --> 17:50.880]  and they set up these villages where you could just cruise on down and everybody
[17:50.880 --> 17:54.360]  was well-dressed and well-fed and smiling and there were curtains in the
[17:54.360 --> 17:58.480]  windows and beautiful flowers blooming in front of all these lovely doors
[17:58.480 --> 18:01.600]  but the reality was it was just a fake facade
[18:01.600 --> 18:05.520]  set up to impress when behind the scenes people were starving
[18:05.520 --> 18:08.520]  and the villages were absolutely destitute the people were dressed in
[18:08.520 --> 18:11.400]  rags and it was total misery
[18:11.400 --> 18:14.600]  so anytime you hear this phrase kind of your fifty cent phrase of the day the
[18:14.600 --> 18:17.200]  phrase potemkin village
[18:17.200 --> 18:20.960]  means a fake village designed to impressed
[18:20.960 --> 18:25.440]  it's now used in politics and economics to describe really anything
[18:25.440 --> 18:29.760]  that is built solely to deceive others into thinking the situation is better
[18:29.760 --> 18:30.600]  than it is
[18:30.600 --> 18:32.080]  well you could say
[18:32.080 --> 18:33.760]  that north korea
[18:33.760 --> 18:38.720]  opens up its borders periodically to kind of portray this notion
[18:38.720 --> 18:40.200]  of being a
[18:40.200 --> 18:44.640]  wonderful well-run happy country filled with smiling lovely women and
[18:44.640 --> 18:47.560]  children and and military might
[18:47.560 --> 18:50.720]  but if you look behind the scenes you'll see the starvation and misery in
[18:50.720 --> 18:51.680]  that country
[18:51.680 --> 18:54.320]  if you have a cell phone in north korea
[18:54.320 --> 18:58.280]  it is uh... i'm i need to probably look at the exact
[18:58.280 --> 19:02.160]  penalty of this but i know that cell phones are absolutely prohibited
[19:02.160 --> 19:05.880]  and they do have labor in concentration camps there for people who defy the
[19:05.880 --> 19:07.600]  regime in really anyway
[19:07.600 --> 19:11.600]  so a cell phone any access to the internet this country is completely cut
[19:11.600 --> 19:13.960]  off from all technology
[19:13.960 --> 19:18.120]  now i tell you all of this and what's going on in the news with north korea
[19:18.120 --> 19:20.720]  well dennis rodman of all people
[19:20.720 --> 19:23.640]  right dennis rodman picture him if you don't know he is

[19:33.200 --> 19:37.400]  well there's a photo of him now in the new york times sitting next to kim jong
[19:37.400 --> 19:40.320]  and and they're both smiling and laughing

[25:09.160 --> 25:14.280]  so i'm i'm delighted to be here with you share in the news and some of the weirdest news like
[25:14.280 --> 25:20.440]  is this bizarre we've got dennis rodman of all people kind of the clown of the nba there
[25:20.440 --> 25:24.640]  with his is brightly colored blue hair and yellow hair if you don't know who he is looking
[25:24.640 --> 25:30.280]  up you will recognize him instantly because he's kind of an icon out there he is uh...
[25:30.280 --> 25:36.960]  let's see how old is he he's fifty one now and she went from being uh... an nba american
[25:36.960 --> 25:41.880]  hall of fame professional basketball player uh... playing for the detroit pistons san
[25:41.880 --> 25:49.720]  antonio spurs chicago bulls l a lakers and dallas mavericks onto a kind of a bizarre
[25:49.720 --> 25:54.960]  acting career there for a while he did some wrestling he's done a whole bunch of stuff
[25:54.960 --> 25:59.800]  he actually uh... put out an autobiography in nineteen ninety six called bad as i want
[25:59.800 --> 26:00.800]  to be
[26:00.800 --> 26:05.320]  uh... he pursued a high-profile affair with madonna and was briefly married to actress
[26:05.320 --> 26:08.320]  carmen electric no from baywatch
[26:08.320 --> 26:09.440]  yeah kind of a
[26:09.440 --> 26:13.320]  kind of a guy is really flitted about and done a lot of things but i gotta say he's
[26:13.320 --> 26:16.040]  he's even outdone himself here
[26:16.040 --> 26:17.240]  in terms of
[26:17.240 --> 26:18.360]  disgusting
[26:18.360 --> 26:20.520]  uh... traveling to north korea
[26:20.520 --> 26:24.840]  and when he got to north korea now this is kind of reminding me of hanoi jane
[26:24.840 --> 26:29.200]  you know when jane fonda went and and smiled and sat with the
[26:29.200 --> 26:33.080]  crew of uh... of an anti-aircraft
[26:33.080 --> 26:35.480]  uh... was an anti-aircraft gun
[26:35.480 --> 26:39.080]  and uh... like literally sat there and smiled with the crew this is the anti-aircraft
[26:39.080 --> 26:41.640]  gun that was used to shoot down american
[26:41.640 --> 26:43.000]  pilots
[26:43.000 --> 26:47.440]  so scary stuff you know we we've got people who do this kind of thing
[26:47.440 --> 26:50.600]  and think that they're being cool these celebrities ago you know over these
[26:50.600 --> 26:51.800]  countries and
[26:51.800 --> 26:55.880]  put themselves into these positions gotta say a lot of american veterans look
[26:55.880 --> 26:58.960]  at jane fonda now and don't want to hear anything about her
[26:58.960 --> 27:02.160]  i would say that even though we're not at war with north korea
[27:02.160 --> 27:05.680]  that given in the country's human rights record
[27:05.680 --> 27:10.400]  that we really need to i think visit the same kind of shame on dennis rodman
[27:10.400 --> 27:13.600]  that was visited on hanoi jane really
[27:13.600 --> 27:18.040]  uh... human rights in north korea heavily restricted
[27:18.040 --> 27:21.240]  public executions arbitrary detentions
[27:21.240 --> 27:24.880]  a total ban on any access to the internet cell phones any modern
[27:24.880 --> 27:26.000]  technology
[27:26.000 --> 27:27.360]  people starving
[27:27.360 --> 27:29.800]  in their their villages across the country
[27:29.800 --> 27:33.400]  and they've got this cult of personality in which their great leader is
[27:33.400 --> 27:37.960]  revered almost as a god he's like the celebrity of of the entire country right
[27:37.960 --> 27:39.720]  now that's kim jong-un
[27:39.720 --> 27:42.680]  the son of recently deceased leader kim jong-il
[27:42.680 --> 27:47.520]  and i think it's rodman here in all of these public publicity photos laughing
[27:47.520 --> 27:50.280]  sitting there having a great old time and let me read some of these these
[27:50.280 --> 27:51.240]  quotes here
[27:51.240 --> 27:56.280]  uh... the cut the company that set this up not surprisingly is called vice
[27:56.280 --> 28:01.360]  media that doesn't surprise me in the least vice media a film crew
[28:01.360 --> 28:05.760]  had rodman and the harlem globetrotters head out there apparently kim jong-un
[28:05.760 --> 28:09.120]  is a big fan of basketball as was his father
[28:09.120 --> 28:11.960]  and uh... the group got into pyeongyang
[28:11.960 --> 28:15.880]  earlier this week let's see last week with approval to
[28:15.880 --> 28:17.160]  film a documentary
[28:17.160 --> 28:19.600]  now let me read you some of the quotes here from the new york times
[28:19.600 --> 28:22.320]  apparently had a blast at the game
[28:22.320 --> 28:27.680]  so kim jong-un invited them back to his home for a party and they had a grand
[28:27.680 --> 28:29.200]  old time
[28:29.200 --> 28:34.040]  speeches were made denis made a very nice one and they were met with rounds
[28:34.040 --> 28:35.440]  of applause
[28:35.440 --> 28:39.680]  yeah the invited him back to his home for a party and had a grand old time
[28:39.680 --> 28:41.440]  this is a direct quote
[28:41.440 --> 28:46.440]  uh... from the guy who said that the film uh... the film trip up very bizarre
[28:46.440 --> 28:49.840]  alright uh... one of the thing i want to read you here at the very end came
[28:49.840 --> 28:54.080]  expressed a rodman he hoped that their visit would improve north america or
[28:54.080 --> 28:56.520]  north korean american relations
[28:56.520 --> 28:59.680]  rodman spent the game watching from a court-side table with kim he also give
[28:59.680 --> 29:02.760]  a speech to the crowd in which he told kim quote
[29:02.760 --> 29:05.200]  you have a friend for life
[29:05.200 --> 29:08.720]  now how much do you think dennis rodman really understands about international
[29:08.720 --> 29:10.440]  politics or history
[29:10.440 --> 29:13.280]  or really anything else about north korea for that matter
[29:13.280 --> 29:16.360]  probably extremely little
[29:16.360 --> 29:19.120]  and yet now we've got all these images coming out of north korea and they
[29:19.120 --> 29:20.560]  thrive on this kind of stuff

[34:32.880 --> 34:39.360]  1999 founded the consumer privacy group Caspian which as I at last can I think
[34:39.360 --> 34:44.160]  we had like 20,000 people who'd sign up to be part of our consumer army opposing
[34:44.160 --> 34:49.000]  the use of RFID spy chips in consumer products I am the co-author of the best

[35:00.920 --> 35:04.600]  relevant today is when we first wrote about them in fact I would say even more

[36:08.920 --> 36:13.680]  you you're really in trouble all right yeah if it's direct young Jebedy young

[36:18.600 --> 36:22.600]  health dot com and then finally I want to put in a plug for the company that I
[36:22.600 --> 36:26.840]  hope to create and that is start page dot com the private alternative to google
[36:26.840 --> 36:31.240]  yahoo and bang if you haven't taken the google needle out of your arm yet please
[36:31.240 --> 36:35.560]  consider doing so because every time you log on to google google makes a record
[36:35.560 --> 36:40.000]  of everything you searched for google is not a search engine designed to give you
[36:40.000 --> 36:45.880]  answers to all your questions for free google is a honeypot it's a trap yeah
[36:45.880 --> 36:49.880]  that's what it is it wants you to log on multiple times a day and tell it what
[36:49.880 --> 36:55.080]  you're thinking and how do you think it is that google this is a perfect segue
[36:55.080 --> 37:01.840]  here that's google what is he CEO Eric Schmidt has now become a billionaire
[37:01.840 --> 37:07.800]  mm-hmm he is about to sell 40% of his stock for over two billion dollars if he
[37:07.800 --> 37:10.240]  hasn't already done so I think he's in the process of doing that right now
[37:10.240 --> 37:16.520]  Eric Schmidt's becoming a billionaire on the backs of all of us really because
[37:16.520 --> 37:21.080]  every time we log on to google and we make a search they say aha got a live
[37:21.080 --> 37:24.880]  one see they've got a file with all of our names at the top and in that file
[37:24.880 --> 37:28.160]  they know every single thing you have ever searched for on google the good
[37:28.160 --> 37:33.120]  news is if you can stand being away from google for nine months about the time it
[37:33.120 --> 37:37.360]  takes for a lady to have a baby you can stay away for nine months then you drop
[37:37.360 --> 37:42.080]  off of their active surveillance list and you drop into kind of a background
[37:42.080 --> 37:45.320]  list where they say they kind of encrypt it and they sort of put it away out of
[37:45.320 --> 37:48.800]  sight so if you can stay away from google for nine months you can get out of the
[37:48.800 --> 37:52.800]  active eyeball that is searching you from google and the best way to do that
[37:52.800 --> 37:56.360]  start page dot com the world's most private search engine I helped to create
[37:56.360 --> 38:01.200]  it so I can vouch for it when you search with start page it searches google for you
[38:01.200 --> 38:05.600]  and what we do is we take your search term submit it to google strip out all
[38:05.600 --> 38:10.240]  identifying information about you we get the results back from google and strip
[38:10.240 --> 38:14.000]  out all of their tracking cookies and other surveillance where and then we
[38:14.000 --> 38:18.800]  serve you those results in total privacy and then we delete all records of your
[38:18.800 --> 38:23.720]  visit so even if they were subpoena or a warrant or god forbid a hacker who knows
[38:23.720 --> 38:28.120]  what were to get into the start page servers there would be literally no
[38:28.120 --> 38:32.240]  information on you whatsoever start page dot com check it out take the two
[38:32.240 --> 38:36.440]  weeks start page challenge and pull that google needle out of your arm
[38:36.440 --> 38:40.520]  alright well speaking of google and Eric Schmidt the other I was telling you
[38:40.520 --> 38:44.160]  that there was a billionaire who recently went to North Korea and that
[38:44.160 --> 38:49.320]  billionaire was Eric Schmidt and his daughter Sophie grown woman put together
[38:49.320 --> 38:54.680]  a fascinating blog on what it's like to actually be in North Korea yeah so I
[38:54.680 --> 38:58.000]  encourage you to check it out it's called Sophie in North Korea you can start
[38:58.000 --> 39:01.120]  page it we don't say google around here because that's billions of dollars of
[39:01.120 --> 39:05.880]  free advertising we say start page it start page Sophie in North Korea and
[39:05.880 --> 39:10.920]  it's called it might not get weirder than this and she blogged about her
[39:10.920 --> 39:15.720]  trip to North Korea and all the bizarre things that she experienced from her
[39:15.720 --> 39:20.200]  arrival through all the traveling the lodgings the everything else and the
[39:20.200 --> 39:24.840]  Potemkin village essentially that was set up for their visit so check it out
[39:24.840 --> 39:28.440]  fascinating reading I wish I had a little more time to go into it but we
[39:28.440 --> 39:32.600]  got a lot more to cover here so yes the Schmidt's going to North Korea in
[39:32.600 --> 39:36.800]  January now we got Dennis Rodman over there and breaking news right now
[39:36.800 --> 39:41.720]  coming out just today North Korea maybe they are emboldened by all these
[39:41.720 --> 39:47.120]  American high-profile folks visiting them they have vowed to cancel the Korean
[39:47.120 --> 39:51.560]  War ceasefire right mind-blowing this literally just came out from Associated
[39:51.560 --> 39:57.080]  Press they have vowed today to cancel the 1953 ceasefire that ended the Korean
[39:57.080 --> 40:00.320]  War now this is bizarre because you'd think a war that was fought in the 50s
[40:00.320 --> 40:04.400]  would just kind of be done and over but it's not at least not according to North
[40:04.400 --> 40:09.880]  Korea they're vowing that on let's see within just a couple of days they're
[40:09.880 --> 40:15.880]  going to lift the ceasefire which would put them back into a state of war with
[40:15.880 --> 40:20.600]  South Korea isn't this wild yeah let me read you this North Korea vowed Tuesday
[40:20.600 --> 40:24.760]  this is the Associated Press to can't that's today to cancel the 1953 ceasefire
[40:24.760 --> 40:29.280]  that ended the Korean War citing a US-led push for punishing US UN
[40:29.280 --> 40:35.400]  sanctions over its recent nuclear test and ongoing US South Korean joint
[40:35.400 --> 40:41.160]  military drills without elaborating the Korean People's Army Supreme Command
[40:41.160 --> 40:45.960]  that would be the North Korean military there warned of surgical strikes meant to
[40:45.960 --> 40:51.680]  unify the divided Korean Peninsula and have an indigenous quote precision
[40:51.680 --> 40:58.080]  nuclear striking tool hmm this comes on amid reports that Washington and North
[40:58.080 --> 41:03.920]  Korean ally Beijing have approved a draft of a UN Security Council resolution
[41:03.920 --> 41:08.800]  calling for sanctions in response to that nuclear test that North Korea did just
[41:08.800 --> 41:11.960]  a couple of weeks ago all right well that's a draft circulating around
[41:11.960 --> 41:16.960]  North Korea in becoming a bit emboldened saying that they're about to go back to
[41:16.960 --> 41:19.920]  war with South Korea all right we'll be watching this one closely I'm sure Alex

[41:39.400 --> 41:47.680]  and listen to the clip they are angry with their government and I saw a Mr.
[41:47.680 --> 41:59.400]  Alex Jones on television recently with Pierce Morgan of CNN and he said before
[41:59.400 --> 42:15.320]  we allow you to take our guns from us 1776 will play out again we intend to
[42:15.320 --> 42:22.520]  return America not to a democracy you are lying to the American people you're
[42:22.520 --> 42:30.040]  robbing them of democracy this is not a democracy this is an oligarchy that is
[42:30.040 --> 42:39.440]  leading America into fascism yes you are stripping the American people of their
[42:39.440 --> 42:48.760]  rights in the name of fighting terror you are the terrorist using your weapons
[42:48.760 --> 42:54.880]  of war and your mighty arsenal to terrorize the nations of the earth to
[42:54.880 --> 43:02.560]  submit to you and your wicked policies of divide and conquer all right well see
[43:02.560 --> 43:06.280]  say what you will about Lewis Farrakhan you got to say he's got this
[43:06.280 --> 43:10.720]  particular one right yeah he saw Alex Jones on Pierce Morgan to what's that
[43:10.720 --> 43:15.520]  like I gotta say like I'm sure someday when all of the media pundits go back
[43:15.520 --> 43:20.160]  and they and all of the academic professors who who do media studies go
[43:20.160 --> 43:24.880]  back and look at like the top 10 pivotal moments on American television or even
[43:24.880 --> 43:29.760]  global television that interviews can have to be right up there where Alex
[43:29.760 --> 43:33.520]  Jones really gave Pierce Morgan a piece of his mind in terms of the Second
[43:33.520 --> 43:38.680]  Amendment I gotta tell you even Lewis Farrakhan talking about this saying that
[43:38.680 --> 43:43.320]  we've we've got we've got some real issues here and if they make an attempt
[43:43.320 --> 43:47.040]  to take away people's guns and their Second Amendment rights that there will
[43:47.040 --> 43:52.960]  be a civil war yeah he this is part of a longer speech by the way called the
[43:52.960 --> 43:55.880]  mark of the beast it's actually a lecture that Lewis Farrakhan gave on the
[43:55.880 --> 43:59.360]  mark of the beast now he's the head of the nation of Islam kind of an
[43:59.360 --> 44:03.720]  interesting political character in his own right very controversial I
[44:03.720 --> 44:08.000]  disagree with a lot of what he's about and agree with other pieces but he's
[44:08.000 --> 44:12.240]  talking about the state of the world at this moment and this particular excerpt
[44:12.240 --> 44:17.600]  is from a series of lectures called the time and what must be done he refers to
[44:17.600 --> 44:21.680]  Elijah Mohammed saying Francis headed towards destruction he speaks out about
[44:21.680 --> 44:27.600]  african and how America went in to kill his quote brother Gaddafi and about how
[44:27.600 --> 44:32.760]  America pits people and races against one another in a divide and conquer
[44:32.760 --> 44:36.920]  mechanism which has been effective hey throughout all of all of history that's
[44:36.920 --> 44:41.080]  how they've done it and the they by the way I've got a phrase for them you're
[44:41.080 --> 44:43.880]  ready for this yeah you can call them the global elite you can call them the
[44:43.880 --> 44:48.760]  Illuminati you can call them the the the the banksters you can call them whatever
[44:48.760 --> 44:53.360]  you want but I refer to them as the pond scum and the reason I use that phrase
[44:53.360 --> 44:58.000]  is I went to Harvard I went to elite prep schools I've hung out with these
[44:58.000 --> 45:02.920]  people and they really view themselves as as the cream that is risen to the top
[45:02.920 --> 45:07.320]  I used to get organic raw milk from a local farm here in New Hampshire and the
[45:07.320 --> 45:10.960]  cream literally would rise to the top of sure our grandparents milk would be that
[45:10.960 --> 45:13.840]  way before they homogenized it so you have this cream and you could skim it
[45:13.840 --> 45:17.720]  off the top and you can whip it up it's into wonderful fresh organic cream well
[45:17.720 --> 45:22.000]  I think that these folks who run the world view themselves as being that cream
[45:22.000 --> 45:26.080]  that's risen to the top you know sort of the cream of the crop the top 1%
[45:26.080 --> 45:31.440]  however they view themselves but I view them as the slime that has risen to the
[45:31.440 --> 45:35.320]  top of the pond see I live in New Hampshire where we're the granite state
[45:35.320 --> 45:39.320]  up here and we've got all these these our whole landscape is basically granite
[45:39.320 --> 45:43.520]  was really tough for our ancestors to plow this land because it's full of rocks
[45:43.520 --> 45:48.640]  and boulders and such but when it rains the the the depressions in the granite
[45:48.640 --> 45:52.600]  collect the water and so we are covered this entire state is covered with ponds
[45:52.600 --> 45:58.480]  and little lakes and lots of water and at a certain point in the summertime that
[45:58.480 --> 46:02.800]  water especially if it's getting runoff from from the fertilizer people put on
[46:02.800 --> 46:08.760]  their lawns that water becomes green and it has a thick mat of slime on the top
[46:08.760 --> 46:14.320]  and I refer to that as the pond scum and that thick mat of slime I think of as
[46:14.320 --> 46:18.960]  the the the people who would rule over the rest of us are the pond scum
[46:18.960 --> 46:24.400]  choking out the light and the oxygen and all of the food from the other 99% of us
[46:24.400 --> 46:28.960]  underneath as we're gasping and what we need to do periodically in New Hampshire
[46:28.960 --> 46:32.600]  we go out with these big rakes and we just scrape that stuff off and let the
[46:32.600 --> 46:36.960]  sunlight circulate and I think that's probably what we need to do as a
[46:36.960 --> 46:41.640]  society as well vote the bums out of office and really really let some
[46:41.640 --> 46:46.200]  sunshine and oxygen back in all right well this reminded me you know Lewis
[46:46.200 --> 46:51.440]  Farrakhan talking about the second amendment and then we've also got Eric
[46:51.440 --> 46:55.440]  Schmidt and Dennis Rodman over there telling Kim Jong-il he's got a friend
[46:55.440 --> 46:59.000]  for life well it was reminded me of Harry Belafonte I remember a couple of
[46:59.000 --> 47:03.200]  weeks ago Harry Belafonte came out with a couple of statements about Obama and
[47:03.200 --> 47:09.760]  speaking of third world dictators Harry Belafonte another I guess celebrity who
[47:09.760 --> 47:13.020]  wants to ride the coattails of some of these things do you remember when he
[47:13.020 --> 47:17.000]  came out and actually said Obama should act like a third world dictator and just
[47:17.000 --> 47:20.040]  put all his opponents in jail I think I've got the clip cute up let's let's
[47:20.040 --> 47:26.480]  listen to that one again we you've worked for decades for some of the quote
[47:26.480 --> 47:33.440]  entitlements that the right wing wants to try and balance this budget balance
[47:33.440 --> 47:39.720]  the deficit off of as you look at this Medicaid Medicare Social Security you
[47:39.720 --> 47:45.240]  been an activist leader from Roosevelt Eleanor Roosevelt through Dr. King
[47:45.240 --> 47:51.120]  through Mandela to Obama how do you view this and and what is the challenge
[47:51.120 --> 47:56.700]  for those that on the field today what I think is most attracted me to this whole
[47:56.700 --> 48:02.440]  process is watching the political maturity of the American people because
[48:02.440 --> 48:05.520]  there was a great question during the first election as to whether or not
[48:05.520 --> 48:11.560]  Barack would even be elected and after the turnout so emphatically put him in
[48:11.560 --> 48:16.160]  the presidency it's interesting to watch the second turn when everybody really
[48:16.160 --> 48:20.560]  didn't quite know what the game would be well the American people in their
[48:20.560 --> 48:25.600]  maturity declared themselves fully we want what Barack Obama is talking about
[48:25.600 --> 48:30.440]  we want the country to go in that direction and what fascinates me is
[48:30.440 --> 48:34.640]  that in the face of millions of Americans expressing their desire the
[48:34.640 --> 48:41.240]  whole political establishment defining it's game that there should be this
[48:41.240 --> 48:49.000]  lingering infestation of really corrupt people who sit trying to dismantle the
[48:49.000 --> 48:54.480]  wishes of the people the mandate that has been given to Barack Obama and I
[48:54.480 --> 49:00.280]  don't know what more they want the only thing left of Iraq to Obama to do is to
[49:00.280 --> 49:05.760]  work like a third world dictator to pull these guys in jail you're violating the
[49:05.760 --> 49:12.920]  American desire now yeah the American people in their maturity okay I'm
[49:12.920 --> 49:17.440]  choking excuse me it's hard even say those words and the American people in
[49:17.440 --> 49:22.240]  their maturity elected Barack Obama for a second term and what he needs to do is
[49:22.240 --> 49:27.600]  act like a third world dictator and put all of his critics in jail okay well
[49:27.600 --> 49:31.120]  this kind of seems like what's going on with the celebrity mentality right now
[49:31.120 --> 49:35.880]  you know you've got Dennis Rodman over there saying to Kim Jong-un you've
[49:35.880 --> 49:40.360]  got a friend for life even the North Korea right on the heels of that great
[49:40.360 --> 49:43.480]  basketball game and the big honking party that they just threw there for
[49:43.480 --> 49:47.760]  Dennis Rodman and everybody you know doing the doing the Jun K dance you know
[49:47.760 --> 49:51.760]  he's he's now trying to say oh yeah and by the way we're gonna strip off the
[49:51.760 --> 49:55.720]  ceasefire so not only are we are we gonna brutalize our own people but now
[49:55.720 --> 50:00.040]  we're gonna start brutalizing the rest of the world with with our armaments our
[50:00.040 --> 50:05.280]  nukes here yeah thank you and then we've got Hillary Harry Bellafonte going out
[50:05.280 --> 50:09.440]  there saying oh yeah Barack Obama's has got to become a third world dictator do
[50:09.440 --> 50:13.560]  these people not understand what third world dictators are about clearly they
[50:13.560 --> 50:17.480]  must not yeah third world dictators scary scary people and not the people you
[50:17.480 --> 50:21.880]  want running your world maybe not the people you want I don't know giving you
[50:21.880 --> 50:27.360]  fame and fortune out there so Dennis Rodman shame on you all right I am your

[54:15.280 --> 54:29.200]  some folks are born make the way to fly the red white and blue and when the
[54:29.200 --> 54:55.280]  flood knows they point the cannon at you
[54:55.280 --> 54:58.880]  I'm back Katherine Albright here no senators son or daughter
[54:58.880 --> 55:03.280]  for that matter got a point out you know when I say yeah I went to elite
[55:03.280 --> 55:08.120]  prep schools well one year ninth grade full scholarship yeah my parents were
[55:08.120 --> 55:14.200]  divorced we had no money and my single parenting mom reached out to our local
[55:14.200 --> 55:16.960]  prep school and said hey maybe I can get my daughter a little better start in life
[55:16.960 --> 55:22.720]  and had me go in and take the test and I was your typical like selling 14-year-old
[55:22.720 --> 55:26.000]  with my arms folded across my chest but apparently I did pretty well in the test
[55:26.000 --> 55:30.920]  because they let me in so I I had an interesting year that year well all my
[55:30.920 --> 55:35.520]  friends at the at the school never really became close friends but they were
[55:35.520 --> 55:39.680]  all going off to kittillion and they were all going off to ski trips in the
[55:39.680 --> 55:43.680]  Swiss Alps to their second homes and they were all having coming out parties
[55:43.680 --> 55:47.400]  and doing all of these things and you know there we were trying to try to
[55:47.400 --> 55:52.000]  survive on brown rice so don't don't be thinking as I say things like that oh
[55:52.000 --> 55:55.280]  yeah Katherine grew up with a silver spoon in her mouth I really didn't but
[55:55.280 --> 56:02.480]  it gave me a real insight into how the senator sons are educated they don't go
[56:02.480 --> 56:05.560]  to the schools that your kids go to well maybe your kids go to one of the one of
[56:05.560 --> 56:07.760]  those schools but they don't go to the schools that they want everybody else's
[56:07.760 --> 56:11.840]  kids out you know the the government schools that they want the rest of
[56:11.840 --> 56:15.760]  everybody to attend our schools they wouldn't touch with a 10-foot pole
[56:15.760 --> 56:19.760]  believe me they've got their kids go into Phillips Exeter and Phillips and over
[56:19.760 --> 56:25.120]  and to all the elite prep schools and they get a very different education very
[56:25.120 --> 56:29.720]  different in fact they're educated to be leaders they're educated to think
[56:29.720 --> 56:33.800]  independently to think their own thoughts as opposed to being educated to
[56:33.800 --> 56:37.760]  sit down and shut up and follow the rules you know nowhere else are you
[56:37.760 --> 56:43.120]  going to find in anywhere in history a period of time in which an entire
[56:43.120 --> 56:48.200]  multiple generations of young people literally millions of people sons and
[56:48.200 --> 56:54.200]  daughters are placed into a bureaucratic government run institution in large
[56:54.200 --> 56:59.640]  numbers almost a factory that cranks them out as you would and they're on the
[56:59.640 --> 57:04.800]  assembly line teaches them to be quiet teaches them to keep their mouth shut
[57:04.800 --> 57:08.800]  teaches them to keep their heads low teaches them to obey authority to ask
[57:08.800 --> 57:14.480]  permission for every last take excuse me Mrs. Johnson can I can I get a
[57:14.480 --> 57:20.200]  Kleenex please my nose is running excuse me mr. Patterson can I use the
[57:20.200 --> 57:26.080]  bathroom I have to pee right that kind of training is not good for liberty I
[57:26.080 --> 57:29.800]  can tell you it's not and I know what I'm talking about I've got a doctorate
[57:29.800 --> 57:33.160]  in education from Harvard University that's what I wanted to actually do in
[57:33.160 --> 57:37.280]  there and I've taught in classrooms I've taught independently I've been an
[57:37.280 --> 57:40.920]  educational consultant I've spent most of my life in one version or another
[57:40.920 --> 57:45.760]  doing education as I believe that my radio show still is probably the most
[57:45.760 --> 57:50.120]  potent form of education I've ever done but as an educator I can say if you
[57:50.120 --> 57:54.520]  want to educate your kids to liberty you're not going to be finding that
[57:54.520 --> 57:58.240]  education as they sit there in a government run institution you know
[57:58.240 --> 58:01.080]  and as I'm thinking about North Korea I don't know what their educational system
[58:01.080 --> 58:04.800]  is like there it would be very interesting to find out because how is it
[58:04.800 --> 58:09.800]  that they get the entire nation falling at the feet of their great leader who's
[58:09.800 --> 58:14.720]  starving them to death yeah and threatening his neighbors nasty stuff

[1:00:35.280 --> 1:00:40.440]  deserved vacation let's hope he's taken it easy I have a feeling he isn't but
[1:00:40.440 --> 1:00:45.240]  let's all let's all wish a little calm and relaxation maybe nice massage maybe a
[1:00:45.240 --> 1:00:50.600]  lovely dinner with his lovely family just a little deep breath time yeah for all
[1:00:50.600 --> 1:00:54.040]  of us you think yeah I think everyone's so well we we do need that we got a
[1:00:54.040 --> 1:00:57.520]  regroup because we got a we got a battle to fight out there we got some we
[1:00:57.520 --> 1:01:01.400]  get some really determined enemies they seem to never rest but I'll tell you
[1:01:01.400 --> 1:01:05.160]  this if you never rest you can find yourself wearing out and we can't do
[1:01:05.160 --> 1:01:09.640]  that before the finish line need you guys all out there tanned rested ready
[1:01:09.640 --> 1:01:14.960]  well-informed well-educated and positive right we got we got to keep that light
[1:01:14.960 --> 1:01:18.720]  going out there because the only way you can fight darkness my friends is by
[1:01:18.720 --> 1:01:22.200]  turning on a light you know if you're standing in a cave and everybody's
[1:01:22.200 --> 1:01:25.840]  groping around in the dark how are you gonna fight that you're gonna blast it
[1:01:25.840 --> 1:01:29.480]  with more dark no you just let a candle you just turn on your flashlight you
[1:01:29.480 --> 1:01:33.680]  just pull the switch you know flip the switch turn on a 60 watt bulb hopefully
[1:01:33.680 --> 1:01:38.080]  incandescent thank you not a mercury bulb and then boom what happens all of
[1:01:38.080 --> 1:01:42.320]  a sudden the darkness can't stick around because darkness in the face of light
[1:01:42.320 --> 1:01:46.560]  must flee you know there's no such thing as a darkness gun like if you have a
[1:01:46.560 --> 1:01:50.360]  room full of light you can't aim dark into it make it go away but if you have
[1:01:50.360 --> 1:01:55.080]  a room full of dark you can aim light into it and boom it's got to flee so I
[1:01:55.080 --> 1:01:58.680]  always say the best way to fight I remind myself some and you know I'm
[1:01:58.680 --> 1:02:02.600]  preaching to the choir here and I'm preaching to my own self that when when
[1:02:02.600 --> 1:02:07.560]  we face these dark themes and I've been facing them since 1999 Alex has been
[1:02:07.560 --> 1:02:12.000]  facing them even longer the only way that you can keep yourself from just
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:16.480]  going crazy and you know getting your blood pressure up and and and your your
[1:02:16.480 --> 1:02:20.640]  panties in a bunch as they say is really focused on all right how can I bring
[1:02:20.640 --> 1:02:25.080]  light into the situation how can we make this better and that doesn't mean don't
[1:02:25.080 --> 1:02:29.440]  be prepared that doesn't mean roll over and show the bad guys your belly at all
[1:02:29.440 --> 1:02:34.080]  by any stretch believe me I'm so glad Alex is on our team you got to be tough
[1:02:34.080 --> 1:02:37.960]  but you also got to figure out how to bring goodness all right well to give
[1:02:37.960 --> 1:02:41.560]  us a better understanding of how the world gets into these crazy places I've
[1:02:41.560 --> 1:02:46.840]  invited my guest for the shower Philip G's and Bartow professors and Bartow on
[1:02:46.840 --> 1:02:51.760]  the show to talk to us about how people turn evil and what I think you'll find
[1:02:51.760 --> 1:02:56.280]  fascinating in this hour interview with Dr. Zimbardo is that they don't turn
[1:02:56.280 --> 1:03:00.160]  evil because they were born that way that it's actually a conditioning process
[1:03:00.160 --> 1:03:06.000]  that is almost like hardwired into the human psychology and all it takes is
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:10.560]  for the right set of circumstances to bring that out and really anybody well
[1:03:10.560 --> 1:03:13.520]  Philip G's and Bartow he's an internationally recognized scholar

[1:03:27.960 --> 1:03:34.040]  Columbia is perhaps best noted for giving psychology away to the public
[1:03:34.040 --> 1:03:38.520]  through his popular PBS TV series called discovering psychology he's also
[1:03:38.520 --> 1:03:43.360]  written many text and trade books among his three hundred publications man this
[1:03:43.360 --> 1:03:47.360]  is a guy who does not rest he was recently president of the American

[1:08:14.040 --> 1:08:29.280]  alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas alex jones
[1:08:29.280 --> 1:08:35.280]  hello Catherine Albert here filling in for alex jones yesterday today and Friday
[1:08:35.280 --> 1:08:40.240]  so glad to be with you guys and it's so glad I'm so delighted to be here in
[1:08:40.240 --> 1:08:45.480]  really the heart of the liberty movement it is such an honor to be able to to
[1:08:45.480 --> 1:08:50.080]  fill in metaphorically and in standing alex jones is enormous shoes and I
[1:08:50.080 --> 1:08:55.240]  know that he's he's been a literally since back in the nineteen nineties when
[1:08:55.240 --> 1:08:59.560]  I first became politically aware alex jones was out there in the wilderness
[1:08:59.560 --> 1:09:04.240]  getting this message out now he's got millions of listeners and that's not an
[1:09:04.240 --> 1:09:07.600]  exaggeration I know that there are millions of you out there I know that
[1:09:07.600 --> 1:09:11.680]  you guys are all on the edge of your seats waiting to see what's going to
[1:09:11.680 --> 1:09:18.160]  unfold next in this country well one of the things I gotta figure out is I'm
[1:09:18.160 --> 1:09:22.280]  thinking about who to pray for you know I am a weird on my sleeve Christian here
[1:09:22.280 --> 1:09:26.200]  I figure out who to pray for in terms of really who are the enemies and how do
[1:09:26.200 --> 1:09:29.680]  they get to be what they are and where they are a little bit in the last hour
[1:09:29.680 --> 1:09:33.520]  we talked about some of the nations across the globe that are doing really
[1:09:33.520 --> 1:09:36.880]  rotten things and I'm thinking here specifically of North Korea where they
[1:09:36.880 --> 1:09:40.960]  have torture camp set up where you can be disappeared in the middle of the night
[1:09:40.960 --> 1:09:45.080]  and one of the questions of course anytime you you really stare into the
[1:09:45.080 --> 1:09:50.440]  face of evil is you ask yourself whether it's you know Nazi prison guards
[1:09:50.440 --> 1:09:56.640]  whether it is North Korean torture chamber operators whether it is even
[1:09:56.640 --> 1:10:02.040]  Americans God forbid in Abu Ghraib and other places you say what is it how do
[1:10:02.040 --> 1:10:06.760]  they find those people what do they do do they comb the entire population looking
[1:10:06.760 --> 1:10:10.240]  for the most evil people they can find to populate these these prisons and
[1:10:10.240 --> 1:10:14.440]  become the guards well if you look at the answer psychologically which you'll
[1:10:14.440 --> 1:10:21.320]  actually find is that those folks are us they're regular people and I like to
[1:10:21.320 --> 1:10:24.480]  think I would never no matter what circumstances you put me in become some
[1:10:24.480 --> 1:10:28.400]  kind of evil torturer but one of the shocking things that's come out of the
[1:10:28.400 --> 1:10:31.720]  literature and really trying to understand how we got Nazi Germany and
[1:10:31.720 --> 1:10:37.840]  how we get North Korea is that there is deep inside of human psychology some
[1:10:37.840 --> 1:10:41.880]  buttons that if you press them the right way and people are not on their guard
[1:10:41.880 --> 1:10:45.880]  against this within themselves that they themselves can become torturers all
[1:10:45.880 --> 1:10:50.160]  right well one of the folks who's done I believe the best job of explaining this
[1:10:50.160 --> 1:10:53.960]  phenomenon and maybe helping us to understand how to turn it around and
[1:10:53.960 --> 1:10:58.440]  prevent it is my guest this hour dr. Philip Zimbardo he's an internationally
[1:10:58.440 --> 1:11:03.080]  recognized scholar educator researcher and media personality he's been a
[1:11:03.080 --> 1:11:08.000]  professor at Stanford University since 1968 he's taught at Yale Columbia and
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:13.800]  elsewhere and he has published over 300 publications he was recently the
[1:11:13.800 --> 1:11:17.840]  president of the American Psychological Association and he is joining us live
[1:11:17.840 --> 1:11:22.560]  from New York where he just delivered the keynote address to the group of
[1:11:22.560 --> 1:11:25.520]  eastern psychologists hello dr. Zimbardo
[1:11:25.520 --> 1:11:31.480]  oh good to be with you great to have you here now I know that your research
[1:11:31.480 --> 1:11:35.720]  spans the gamut you have in your lengthy career you've covered so many
[1:11:35.720 --> 1:11:40.160]  different topics in the last hour on the show I was talking about what's going
[1:11:40.160 --> 1:11:43.760]  on over in North Korea you know we've got Dennis Rodman over there rubbing
[1:11:43.760 --> 1:11:49.760]  rubbing elbows with Kim Jong-un and going to parties and saying Kim Jong-un
[1:11:49.760 --> 1:11:53.200]  has a friend for life and it kind of kind of some weird stuff going on in the
[1:11:53.200 --> 1:11:57.840]  media but when we think about North Korea which by the way also just today
[1:11:57.840 --> 1:12:02.320]  announced that they're going to reverse the ceasefire the 1953 ceasefire against
[1:12:02.320 --> 1:12:06.120]  South Korea you got to say well hang on a second that's that's a brutal regime
[1:12:06.120 --> 1:12:10.240]  they've got people in prison camps there that are tortured regularly up in North
[1:12:10.240 --> 1:12:15.040]  Korea and I wanted to bring you on because of your psychological insights
[1:12:15.040 --> 1:12:20.520]  into what leads people to torture you did a series of experiments at one point
[1:12:20.520 --> 1:12:24.700]  the prison experiments that I think shed some light on that can you can you
[1:12:24.700 --> 1:12:28.360]  give us an overview of what you've learned and what you learned from the
[1:12:28.360 --> 1:12:32.160]  prison experiments yeah I'd be happy to do that and I appreciate your your
[1:12:32.160 --> 1:12:37.960]  introduction to your audience I think I have to begin by focusing on you know
[1:12:37.960 --> 1:12:43.360]  it's a wrong question to ask who are those evil people that there's no
[1:12:43.360 --> 1:12:48.760]  question that people do bad things evil things torture is among the bad things
[1:12:48.760 --> 1:12:54.240]  people do but so is prejudice and discrimination so is bullying and so I've
[1:12:54.240 --> 1:12:58.920]  been obsessed with the question of why did good people turn evil not why did
[1:12:58.920 --> 1:13:04.360]  bad people do bad things and I started actually as a kid asking that question
[1:13:04.360 --> 1:13:08.600]  because I grew up in a ghetto in the South Bronx in poverty in New York if you
[1:13:08.600 --> 1:13:12.520]  grew up in any inner city anywhere in the world you're surrounded by people
[1:13:12.520 --> 1:13:17.360]  whose job it is to get good kids to do bad things for money and so I always
[1:13:17.360 --> 1:13:22.040]  wondered as a kid how come some of my friends went took the bad past and I
[1:13:22.040 --> 1:13:27.760]  and some other kids took the good past the right past and so again even as a kid I
[1:13:27.760 --> 1:13:33.920]  realized that you know evil is not in people evil is in situations so that if
[1:13:33.920 --> 1:13:38.480]  you grow up privileged you don't have those negative influence agents around
[1:13:38.480 --> 1:13:44.440]  you to tempt you to to do bad things and so now we're talking about for
[1:13:44.440 --> 1:13:51.280]  example Abu Ghraib this intramus prison that that really
[1:13:51.280 --> 1:13:57.640]  integrated America's image to the world because what we saw in those few
[1:13:57.640 --> 1:14:04.440]  images were young American prison guards men and women for the first time not
[1:14:04.440 --> 1:14:08.240]  only abusing prisons but apparently taking delight in it smiling giving high
[1:14:08.240 --> 1:14:13.320]  vibes having prisoners in horrific positions piled up naked naked and so
[1:14:13.320 --> 1:14:18.320]  we're dragging them around by at least and so when I saw that that reminded me
[1:14:18.320 --> 1:14:23.840]  of my Stanford prison study which I did back in 1971 and there the question I
[1:14:23.840 --> 1:14:28.200]  asked is what happens if you put good people in a bad place what happens if you
[1:14:28.200 --> 1:14:35.120]  put good apples in a bad barrel and so the study was we had 24 students
[1:14:35.120 --> 1:14:40.280]  colleges from all over the United States who were in the San Francisco area in the
[1:14:40.280 --> 1:14:45.520]  summer and they answered an ad to be part of a study of prison life for two
[1:14:45.520 --> 1:14:50.080]  weeks to go for two weeks we randomly assigned have to be guards after you
[1:14:50.080 --> 1:14:54.280]  prison after we pre-selected the ones who are most normal most healthy
[1:14:54.280 --> 1:14:58.680]  psychologically and physically and then we gave them uniforms and we put them in
[1:14:58.680 --> 1:15:03.960]  a very real realistic kind of psychological prison and what that means
[1:15:03.960 --> 1:15:09.280]  is with you know bars on their doors and solitary confinement and and all the
[1:15:09.280 --> 1:15:14.160]  accoutrements of a prison we had local police arrest them arrest the prisoners
[1:15:14.160 --> 1:15:19.040]  bring them to the real jail and then to our jail we had prison chaplain and
[1:15:19.040 --> 1:15:23.960]  public defenders and parole board hearings and visiting days so essentially I
[1:15:23.960 --> 1:15:29.520]  created a very realistic simulation and the idea was to observe what happens
[1:15:29.520 --> 1:15:33.240]  when a good kid happens to be put in the role of guard and another good kid
[1:15:33.240 --> 1:15:39.360]  happens to put in the role of prisoner and to make a long experiment and the
[1:15:39.360 --> 1:15:43.680]  prisoners of course lived there 24-7 the guards worked eight-hour shifts what
[1:15:43.680 --> 1:15:48.960]  happened is within two days the first normal healthy college student had an
[1:15:48.960 --> 1:15:52.840]  emotional breakdown and each day thereafter another prisoner had a
[1:15:52.840 --> 1:15:57.320]  breakdown in the same way how could that be well they were responding to the
[1:15:57.320 --> 1:16:04.480]  sadistic brutal behavior of their guards and essentially what happened was the
[1:16:04.480 --> 1:16:10.840]  boys in the role of guards began to do what guards do is to use the power to
[1:16:10.840 --> 1:16:14.160]  dominate to treat the prisoners as if they were their puppets the fact that's
[1:16:14.160 --> 1:16:18.080]  the phrase one of the guards use we're like puppeteers and they are a puppet
[1:16:18.080 --> 1:16:23.600]  because any prison setting is about one thing it's about power so that if you
[1:16:23.600 --> 1:16:27.520]  are in the guard role you have to constantly demonstrate you have power
[1:16:27.520 --> 1:16:32.400]  over the prisoners which means you have to impress upon them that they have none
[1:16:32.400 --> 1:16:37.040]  in any attempt by prisoners to have more power is created with punishment with
[1:16:37.040 --> 1:16:42.280]  abuse and the prisoner guard metaphor is a metaphor of life is not just prison
[1:16:42.280 --> 1:16:47.800]  you see this in some marital relationships you see this in some you
[1:16:47.800 --> 1:16:52.120]  know teacher-student relationships etc and so I had to end the study after six
[1:16:52.120 --> 1:16:57.520]  days we couldn't go the full two weeks because it was out of control yeah and
[1:16:57.520 --> 1:17:00.720]  when when you talk about out of control I know that the that the prisoners
[1:17:00.720 --> 1:17:06.040]  themselves were responding by by having breakdowns what were the prison guards
[1:17:06.040 --> 1:17:12.280]  doing the prison guards were enjoying the prison guards were enjoying their
[1:17:12.280 --> 1:17:17.480]  power again most people have a minimal amount of power I mean if you're rich you
[1:17:17.480 --> 1:17:23.120]  have some monetary power if you're big you have power over little kids a little
[1:17:23.120 --> 1:17:27.840]  of people the guards are really acting like big bullies you know for the first
[1:17:27.840 --> 1:17:33.480]  time they were enjoying the exercise of power and really that is not the core
[1:17:33.480 --> 1:17:39.000]  what you mean by evil evil is the exercise and abuse of power to intentionally
[1:17:39.000 --> 1:17:46.040]  harm other people in various ways now the key message for your audience is that
[1:17:46.040 --> 1:17:50.680]  what art by study showed and what an early study by Stanley Milgram who is
[1:17:50.680 --> 1:17:57.040]  my high school classmate in the Bronx he did a famous study where he had man
[1:17:57.040 --> 1:18:02.560]  not not college student men 20 to 50 years old think that they were being a
[1:18:02.560 --> 1:18:09.400]  teacher teaching their student a lesson by punishing the student whenever he
[1:18:09.400 --> 1:18:18.400]  made a mistake and two-thirds of those ordinary young men delivered up to 450
[1:18:18.400 --> 1:18:23.320]  bowls of what they thought was almost lethal shock of course the person who
[1:18:23.320 --> 1:18:26.960]  was pretending to be the learner the student was not actually getting the
[1:18:26.960 --> 1:18:31.040]  shock but the person delivering it thought he was you know so again the
[1:18:31.040 --> 1:18:35.960]  Milgram study and the Zimbardo-Stanford prison study together they what we have
[1:18:35.960 --> 1:18:40.760]  to be aware of is how much our individual behavior is under the influence
[1:18:40.760 --> 1:18:46.240]  of situational forces in the Milgram study it was an authority a kind of lab
[1:18:46.240 --> 1:18:50.200]  code saying you must go on it was putting people in a role your teacher your
[1:18:50.200 --> 1:18:53.560]  student in my study it was during the role of prisoner guard you're in a
[1:18:53.560 --> 1:19:00.320]  setting which encourages guards to dominate prison prisoners and my study
[1:19:00.320 --> 1:19:04.160]  we had to have uniforms guards had had elaborate military uniforms prisoners
[1:19:04.160 --> 1:19:11.720]  had you know demeaning uniforms so so again we the people we chose in my
[1:19:11.720 --> 1:19:16.960]  study were really good apples and we put them in a really bad barrel and sad
[1:19:16.960 --> 1:19:24.040]  messages bad barrels corrupt most good people not all but most and so again the
[1:19:24.040 --> 1:19:31.080]  messages this is this is true in Abu Ghraib you know in Abu Ghraib just bring
[1:19:31.080 --> 1:19:38.160]  some of the audience up to date in 2004 we were shocked the whole world
[1:19:38.160 --> 1:19:43.640]  especially Americans were shocked to see our military police abusing Iraqi
[1:19:43.640 --> 1:19:47.800]  prisoners in a horrific way and everybody said who are these bad apples
[1:19:47.800 --> 1:19:51.600]  well hold that thought we're coming out to a break when we come back I want to
[1:19:51.600 --> 1:19:55.040]  talk about Abu Ghraib with my guest Phillips Zimbardo speaking about
[1:19:55.040 --> 1:19:58.840]  torture and how does it lie at the heart of all of us God I hope not

[1:23:11.580 --> 1:23:16.840]  about 20 minutes but they were long gone with our TV jewelry and my guns I kept
[1:23:16.840 --> 1:23:21.040]  thinking what if my family had been home the police officers said that more
[1:23:21.040 --> 1:23:25.880]  than 85% of break-ins are through a door and that dead bolts alone don't stop
[1:23:25.880 --> 1:23:30.680]  intruders the officer told me to go to easy armor net if we wanted something

[1:24:11.960 --> 1:24:32.440]  we're back Katherine albert here speaking about torture now phillips
[1:24:32.440 --> 1:24:36.520]  imbardo is my guess this hour if you want to call it torture but maybe just
[1:24:36.520 --> 1:24:41.360]  the dark side of humanity we know that is it lord action who has the quote power
[1:24:41.360 --> 1:24:44.040]  corrupts an absolute power corrupts absolutely
[1:24:44.040 --> 1:24:48.840]  dr. zimbardo is that it would would you concur with that do you think that it
[1:24:48.840 --> 1:24:52.560]  really is just the power itself that is the corrupting force in in human beings
[1:24:52.560 --> 1:24:57.440]  it's one of the corrupting forces I guess I would back up a little bit and
[1:24:57.440 --> 1:25:02.440]  say you know one of the amazing things that we have discovered me a
[1:25:02.440 --> 1:25:08.040]  psychologist biologist is this brain that we have that gives rise to our mind
[1:25:08.040 --> 1:25:14.320]  that really gives us infinite capacity to do anything that is imaginable so in
[1:25:14.320 --> 1:25:21.200]  a sense all of us have the potential to be kind of cool carrying on different
[1:25:21.200 --> 1:25:27.680]  destructive or creative and really that same line pushes some people to become
[1:25:27.680 --> 1:25:32.280]  villains perpetrators of evil and others to do really heroic things which is my
[1:25:32.280 --> 1:25:37.160]  new mission life so that important thing is not to think I'm not that kind of
[1:25:37.160 --> 1:25:41.560]  person when you when you hear about something terrible happening rather
[1:25:41.560 --> 1:25:46.720]  ask the question how could that person have done that we don't have to know
[1:25:46.720 --> 1:25:51.720]  both about the person but also about the situation that that person was
[1:25:51.720 --> 1:25:57.480]  operating and living in at that time so for example most kids have been involved
[1:25:57.480 --> 1:26:02.480]  in high school shooting or college shooting one of the things that we have
[1:26:02.480 --> 1:26:08.320]  discovered is in almost every case they were socially excluded they were
[1:26:08.320 --> 1:26:13.720]  rejected by their peers they were social isolate they went around Virginia Tech
[1:26:13.720 --> 1:26:18.880]  but they went around the school with no friends feeling feeling lonely and
[1:26:18.880 --> 1:26:25.760]  isolated and so that is now a basic condition which can give rise to that
[1:26:25.760 --> 1:26:30.400]  kind of extreme behavior it also gives rise to less extreme behavior like
[1:26:30.400 --> 1:26:35.720]  China's simply feeling shown but what it means is what about all those people in
[1:26:35.720 --> 1:26:40.680]  all those schools who never took the time to make friends to reach out to be an
[1:26:40.680 --> 1:26:45.320]  ally to say hey sit down next to me how you doing how you feeling you know so
[1:26:45.320 --> 1:26:51.400]  again I'm just trying to get away from from simplistic view of evil bad deeds
[1:26:51.400 --> 1:26:56.120]  are in bad people because that's the dominant view and then what do you do
[1:26:56.120 --> 1:27:02.040]  you identify them you imprison them you torture them you execute them and the
[1:27:02.040 --> 1:27:08.880]  problem continues because we have evil situations and we have evil system well
[1:27:08.880 --> 1:27:12.560]  in this idea that we have evil systems I think I think it's there there is a
[1:27:12.560 --> 1:27:16.720]  tendency to say I'll look at that person over there they're a psychopath or they
[1:27:16.720 --> 1:27:20.880]  were just born wrong or they were wired wrong is it isn't the case that some
[1:27:20.880 --> 1:27:25.560]  people truly are wired without human empathy and then other people can be
[1:27:25.560 --> 1:27:30.600]  socially maneuvered into not having empathy yeah yes of course I mean that
[1:27:30.600 --> 1:27:36.440]  what what we know actually both the truth the country is about 1% of every
[1:27:36.440 --> 1:27:42.560]  population in the world are people who grow up with really a brain defect that
[1:27:42.560 --> 1:27:47.640]  they we call being a psychopath and they grow up without the ability to feel
[1:27:47.640 --> 1:27:51.560]  empathy for other people without the ability to feel such way these are
[1:27:51.560 --> 1:27:55.680]  people are kids you know can torture animals and have take the light in it
[1:27:55.680 --> 1:28:01.920]  and not not not feel any guilt or shame only 1% you see and the problem is in a
[1:28:01.920 --> 1:28:06.360]  lot so for example with the shooting in Connecticut you know people focused on
[1:28:06.360 --> 1:28:12.200]  oh this kid was a psychopath well that that may be true but that was not true
[1:28:12.200 --> 1:28:18.040]  of any of the other kids and all the many other shooting so so but again the
[1:28:18.040 --> 1:28:23.680]  system analysis is something that we rarely do so as I said social
[1:28:23.680 --> 1:28:29.920]  psychologists like they say but what we have to understand is basic conditions
[1:28:29.920 --> 1:28:36.120]  that people live in so if you live in poverty that's a social condition that's
[1:28:36.120 --> 1:28:40.160]  going to that's going to increase the likelihood that you're going to do bad
[1:28:40.160 --> 1:28:45.800]  things for money but also if you live in a setting where people practice de
[1:28:45.800 --> 1:28:50.080]  humanization they think of others as the same if you're in a situation where
[1:28:50.080 --> 1:28:55.840]  people treat you in an anonymous way like you're insignificant we have we
[1:28:55.840 --> 1:29:01.280]  show that that leads to negative behavior if you're in a situation where you're
[1:29:01.280 --> 1:29:05.560]  part of the group and the group has a negative norms that is it's okay to smoke
[1:29:05.560 --> 1:29:12.160]  heroin okay to have unprotected sex it's okay to steal, cheat, lie, tell, do racist
[1:29:12.160 --> 1:29:16.920]  things then that group has a powerful influence on you because you go along to
[1:29:16.920 --> 1:29:23.080]  get along so we know we have a recipe in psychology of what can make a good kid a
[1:29:23.080 --> 1:29:29.040]  good person of any age start down that negative path and now what I'm trying to
[1:29:29.040 --> 1:29:33.600]  do is reverse it how do you get an ordinary person to start to be inspired
[1:29:33.600 --> 1:29:39.040]  to start on the good path all right we're visiting with Dr. Philip Zimbardo he is
[1:29:39.040 --> 1:29:43.600]  a nationally renowned expert on psychology he's also the author of a book
[1:29:43.600 --> 1:29:47.040]  called the Lucifer Effect I want to get into that a little bit more when we come
[1:29:47.040 --> 1:29:52.920]  back so good people turn evil stay tuned we're on the march the empires on the
[1:29:52.920 --> 1:29:58.960]  run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[1:30:00.760 --> 1:30:05.280]  I had tried everything I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating I was
[1:30:05.280 --> 1:30:09.360]  lifting weights and jogging but nothing was working my body was literally
[1:30:09.360 --> 1:30:13.800]  starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins and as soon as I
[1:30:13.800 --> 1:30:18.720]  had that I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be

[1:33:07.400 --> 1:33:21.880]  heart of the resistance you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:33:21.880 --> 1:33:27.080]  yeah those jackboots man they keep coming back historically over and over and
[1:33:27.080 --> 1:33:32.040]  over it's the reason I became a Liberty Freedom Privacy Advocate is because I've
[1:33:32.040 --> 1:33:35.520]  got a Florida ceiling bookshelf four feet wide all the way up to the ceiling
[1:33:35.520 --> 1:33:39.000]  and how many shelves are on there but there's a lot of books of 20th century
[1:33:39.000 --> 1:33:43.600]  history and the reality is anytime you give too much power to those guys with
[1:33:43.600 --> 1:33:47.640]  the jackboots they will take it from you and they will use it to stomp on you
[1:33:47.640 --> 1:33:51.840]  it's just the way things are and I guess this hour Philip Zimbardo has devoted a
[1:33:51.840 --> 1:33:55.200]  career to trying to figure out why this is and then how to counter it what we
[1:33:55.200 --> 1:34:00.200]  can do to take a look really really stare down the face of human evil and
[1:34:00.200 --> 1:34:05.640]  figure out what we should be doing instead Philip Dr. Zimbardo there's
[1:34:05.640 --> 1:34:10.120]  there's a story that was in the news yesterday and I couldn't help but think
[1:34:10.120 --> 1:34:16.440]  of your research as we were hearing the dramatic 911 tape of this dispatcher who
[1:34:16.440 --> 1:34:20.200]  was fighting to save a patient now I know you've been doing keynotes and you
[1:34:20.200 --> 1:34:24.920]  may not have heard this but there is a retirement home or a nursing facility
[1:34:24.920 --> 1:34:29.840]  called Glenwood Gardens in Bakersfield, California and there was an 87 year old
[1:34:29.840 --> 1:34:35.560]  woman who collapsed and was not breathing and the dispatcher the 9-11
[1:34:35.560 --> 1:34:40.440]  911 dispatcher is is trying to give instructions to the nurse at the
[1:34:40.440 --> 1:34:46.080]  facility to give this woman CPR and is frantically making every effort to try
[1:34:46.080 --> 1:34:51.600]  to encourage this woman to please start CPR to save the woman's life and just a
[1:34:51.600 --> 1:34:54.360]  quick quote from here and then I want to and I want to play the audio clip
[1:34:54.360 --> 1:34:59.600]  because it's chilling she says the CPR or excuse me the 9-11 911
[1:34:59.600 --> 1:35:02.960]  dispatcher says I understand if your boss is telling you you can't do CPR but as
[1:35:02.960 --> 1:35:06.160]  a human being is there anybody who's willing to help this lady and not let
[1:35:06.160 --> 1:35:10.840]  her die is there a gardener any staff anyone who doesn't work for you anywhere
[1:35:10.840 --> 1:35:14.160]  can we flag someone down in the street and get them to help this lady can we
[1:35:14.160 --> 1:35:18.880]  flag a stranger down I bet a stranger would help her and the answer that she
[1:35:18.880 --> 1:35:47.840]  repeatedly receives is no let's listen to the clip it's chilling yeah not at
[1:35:47.840 --> 1:35:52.560]  this time all right doctors in part of this this coldness I think is really
[1:35:52.560 --> 1:35:56.680]  shocked the nation is we've been hearing this this 911 call that anyone would
[1:35:56.680 --> 1:36:01.760]  put the bureaucratic rules of just their local facility which I guess told the
[1:36:01.760 --> 1:36:05.760]  nurses that they're not allowed to perform CPR that anybody would be able
[1:36:05.760 --> 1:36:10.480]  to coldly stand by and let a fellow human being die with that degree of just
[1:36:10.480 --> 1:36:15.880]  dispassionate lack of emotion lack of compassion lack of anything is this one
[1:36:15.880 --> 1:36:19.360]  of these cycle paths to this nurse is she one of the 1% it was just more and
[1:36:19.360 --> 1:36:23.640]  wrong or what what's going on in this call no no it's not ago I mean again
[1:36:23.640 --> 1:36:29.160]  it's really important not to blame on the nurse she is she is simply part of a
[1:36:29.160 --> 1:36:34.600]  system that says here's what we don't want to do because we could get to that
[1:36:34.600 --> 1:36:38.520]  suppose you start the CPR and and you don't do it right and the person will
[1:36:38.520 --> 1:36:44.440]  die the first of all in it in any home to the age of everybody she don't have
[1:36:44.440 --> 1:36:49.480]  to do CPR that should be a requirement by every state so we start we have to
[1:36:49.480 --> 1:36:53.280]  change the law so that not only is it permissible but they have to know how to
[1:36:53.280 --> 1:36:58.400]  do it this is reminiscent what happened last year for the member in China a
[1:36:58.400 --> 1:37:04.280]  little girl as hard as walking along a street and a car runs over her and is
[1:37:04.280 --> 1:37:09.320]  this there is a surveillance camera that shows in 10 minutes maybe 18 people
[1:37:09.320 --> 1:37:14.960]  passed by was in one foot of that girl and no one stops to pick her up and and
[1:37:14.960 --> 1:37:18.840]  she dies the next day and this is the mark I've been trying to just as this
[1:37:18.840 --> 1:37:23.920]  one should be now in America and the reaction was most people said I wouldn't
[1:37:23.920 --> 1:37:28.400]  help either not that I didn't care but people might have thought I did it or
[1:37:28.400 --> 1:37:32.840]  maybe if I if I moved her it would make it worse so this is what you call the
[1:37:32.840 --> 1:37:37.320]  need for a proof of marriage in law that is if you input with good intention
[1:37:37.320 --> 1:37:42.080]  try to help somebody in an emergency situation you cannot be held liable for
[1:37:42.080 --> 1:37:47.800]  any negative consequences in America I think only 22 states have such a law and
[1:37:47.800 --> 1:37:53.040]  so so many people here self-interested they you know it's my I don't want to
[1:37:53.040 --> 1:37:57.960]  lose my job if I go against the rules the rules are don't do it but kind of
[1:37:57.960 --> 1:38:04.040]  lying is how do you step out of that rule-based system and say I cannot allow
[1:38:04.040 --> 1:38:08.520]  another human being to die because suppose that was my mother suppose that
[1:38:08.520 --> 1:38:14.480]  was me and so partly what we have to do is you know how do you get people to
[1:38:14.480 --> 1:38:20.360]  really feel empathy and compassion for every other person not just an old
[1:38:20.360 --> 1:38:24.840]  person or not just a person a different gender or race or whatever but for
[1:38:24.840 --> 1:38:29.880]  everyone and so this is just jumping ahead of us so this is what I've been
[1:38:29.880 --> 1:38:35.520]  trying to do in moving from my focus on why did good people turn evil to how
[1:38:35.520 --> 1:38:42.000]  can we make ordinary people like like that that aid in it to be inspired to do
[1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:45.360]  the heroic thing in this case the role thing is to go against the system say
[1:38:45.360 --> 1:38:50.200]  I'm sorry I know it's a rule I have to do this and she would have been she
[1:38:50.200 --> 1:38:53.960]  would have been honored now rather than shame right she would have been the
[1:38:53.960 --> 1:38:58.040]  hero and and now simply because she did follow the rules and you know when
[1:38:58.040 --> 1:39:01.440]  you're living in a society where the rules begin to go crazy and I'm sure
[1:39:01.440 --> 1:39:05.520]  that we could look at Nazi Germany or North Korea as examples right now even
[1:39:05.520 --> 1:39:10.200]  where you know in North Korea it is the appropriate thing to do that if you see
[1:39:10.200 --> 1:39:14.600]  somebody with a cell phone and you're a member of the regime there that you beat
[1:39:14.600 --> 1:39:19.120]  that person brutally and torture them and put them into a labor camp you know
[1:39:19.120 --> 1:39:24.160]  so when the rules begin to go crazy and things begin to go totally wrong it
[1:39:24.160 --> 1:39:27.280]  just seems that there there's such a difficulty of human beings to resist that
[1:39:27.280 --> 1:39:30.960]  I want to I want before we open up the phone lines and let me go ahead and do
[1:39:30.960 --> 1:39:36.240]  that now 1-800-259-9231 for your questions and comments for my guess
[1:39:36.240 --> 1:39:40.360]  this hour dr. Philip Zimbardo before we do that I want to talk I know you've got
[1:39:40.360 --> 1:39:44.240]  a new project and I also want to talk about the Lucifer effect so you went
[1:39:44.240 --> 1:39:48.440]  from doing the Stanford prison experiments which people can find online
[1:39:48.440 --> 1:39:51.920]  they can start page that we don't use Google around here we use start page they
[1:39:51.920 --> 1:39:56.200]  can start page it they can also look up your book the Lucifer effect and it
[1:39:56.200 --> 1:40:01.220]  kind of follow your progression as a force of change in the psychological
[1:40:01.220 --> 1:40:05.080]  community the Lucifer effect was maybe one step behind where you are now which
[1:40:05.080 --> 1:40:09.400]  is really the hero project to try to get people into not just being evil but
[1:40:09.400 --> 1:40:13.800]  but not just not being evil but literally becoming heroes just really
[1:40:13.800 --> 1:40:18.800]  quickly can you over give us the overview of the Lucifer effect sure so
[1:40:18.800 --> 1:40:23.520]  I mentioned earlier that I did this a dramatic study called the Stanford
[1:40:23.520 --> 1:40:27.880]  prison study to demonstrate it was a very vivid demonstration of the ease
[1:40:27.880 --> 1:40:32.720]  with which good people good college and college of colleges could be seduced to
[1:40:32.720 --> 1:40:36.720]  do bad things if they were put in the role of a guard about power in a
[1:40:36.720 --> 1:40:42.720]  situation where that power where they could use that power and then in 2004
[1:40:42.720 --> 1:40:47.320]  Abu Ghraib erupted and there were direct parallels between what happened in Abu
[1:40:47.320 --> 1:40:52.200]  Ghraib prison and in my prison and so I became an expert witness for one of one
[1:40:52.200 --> 1:40:56.760]  of our guards to demonstrate that he was a good apple and that the military put
[1:40:56.760 --> 1:41:02.440]  him in a very bad barrel and I was able to demonstrate that and in my book
[1:41:02.440 --> 1:41:07.920]  Lucifer effect I not only present the Stanford prison study in almost moment by
[1:41:07.920 --> 1:41:12.480]  moment hour by hour but then I take the reader to Abu Ghraib and I think I know
[1:41:12.480 --> 1:41:16.360]  more about Abu Ghraib than almost anyone I was immersed in it for years for
[1:41:16.360 --> 1:41:20.440]  several years but to really understand how could this happen how could good
[1:41:20.440 --> 1:41:24.640]  American men and women do these terrible things the point is every guard on the
[1:41:24.640 --> 1:41:28.600]  night shift is terrible things no guard on the day shift is so that's a
[1:41:28.600 --> 1:41:34.360]  situational difference and it's a simple answer the military intelligence told
[1:41:34.360 --> 1:41:38.280]  only the guards on the night shift break the prison it would every have to do so
[1:41:38.280 --> 1:41:42.120]  when we interrogate them they'll spill the beans and in three months no senior
[1:41:42.120 --> 1:41:46.400]  officer ever went down to the dungeon at night the day shift if they didn't tell
[1:41:46.400 --> 1:41:50.560]  them that and it was always surveillance so that's the reason it was not that they
[1:41:50.560 --> 1:41:53.280]  put the bad guards on the night shift and the good guards in the day shift
[1:41:53.280 --> 1:41:59.200]  that's what we call a situational variable and and so now in Abu Ghraib for
[1:41:59.200 --> 1:42:04.280]  example they don't do that they have procedures they have oversight they have
[1:42:04.280 --> 1:42:12.200]  you know situational procedures that will prevent such such abuses and so the
[1:42:12.200 --> 1:42:17.240]  Luther fact book summarizes that and then in the last chapter I say how do you
[1:42:17.240 --> 1:42:21.320]  resist when these are powerful forces and the point is that in almost all
[1:42:21.320 --> 1:42:25.800]  situates it's the majority of conformed comply all day but curiously there's
[1:42:25.800 --> 1:42:31.760]  always a small percent who resist ten percent or more and then I focus on maybe
[1:42:31.760 --> 1:42:35.840]  we can think of them as heroes but what does it need to be a hero the curious
[1:42:35.840 --> 1:42:40.200]  thing is there's almost no research on heroism it's not in any psychology text
[1:42:40.200 --> 1:42:46.040]  it's not in the positive psychology movement it's really so now I'm I want
[1:42:46.040 --> 1:42:51.600]  to they're starting to do research on heroism trying to get funding to
[1:42:51.600 --> 1:42:56.480]  sponsor students everywhere to do research on heroism and but in addition
[1:42:56.480 --> 1:43:01.400]  what what I've done is created a project in San Francisco that we hope we can
[1:43:01.400 --> 1:43:05.960]  scale up nationally internationally called a heroic imagination project or
[1:43:05.960 --> 1:43:12.200]  hit our website www.heroicimagination.org and essentially it's to teach
[1:43:12.200 --> 1:43:16.640]  young people how to be wise and effective heroes and the way we're going to
[1:43:16.640 --> 1:43:20.960]  teach them is first teach them the basic street smarts that I learned in the
[1:43:20.960 --> 1:43:26.640]  Bronx South Bronx of you know what what are the forces of evil and how do you
[1:43:26.640 --> 1:43:31.960]  identify them how do you how do you learn to resist how do you learn to pose
[1:43:31.960 --> 1:43:38.800]  and and then how do we inspire you to to the bright side to teach you how to be
[1:43:38.800 --> 1:43:42.880]  wise and effective hero how to focus on the other how to make other people feel
[1:43:42.880 --> 1:43:47.400]  special how to be a positive deviant heroes always deviant because you look
[1:43:47.400 --> 1:43:52.440]  around other people doing nothing and so how do you practice so that when the
[1:43:52.440 --> 1:43:56.880]  opportunity arises you're not going to give in to the group and do nothing you're
[1:43:56.880 --> 1:44:00.280]  going to do the right thing when people are doing nothing the other thing I
[1:44:00.280 --> 1:44:03.840]  should mention is that there are two kinds of evil there's the evil of action
[1:44:03.840 --> 1:44:08.440]  where you do a bad thing and the broader evil that we all are part of is the
[1:44:08.440 --> 1:44:14.640]  evil of inaction so the bully a bully is the evil of action but all the rest of
[1:44:14.640 --> 1:44:18.040]  us who have known about bullies and junior high and high school and now in
[1:44:18.040 --> 1:44:22.120]  business world who've done nothing we are guilty of the evil of an action by
[1:44:22.120 --> 1:44:28.440]  our inaction we allow that evil to be continued now I'm on your website
[1:44:28.440 --> 1:44:33.640]  heroic imagination org you've got just a wealth of resources here there's a
[1:44:33.640 --> 1:44:38.080]  video library stories of heroism you've got information about the bystander
[1:44:38.080 --> 1:44:43.560]  effect conformity obedience to unjust authority which I think comes right into
[1:44:43.560 --> 1:44:48.680]  this 9-1-1 call it's all there and I would encourage people to check out
[1:44:48.680 --> 1:44:55.960]  heroic imagination org is there a book that goes with this no I'm collecting
[1:44:55.960 --> 1:45:01.120]  we have I'm a research oriented but how does you know in fact I now have 400
[1:45:01.120 --> 1:45:07.360]  publications not not just 300 that you mentioned earlier I work a lot so there
[1:45:07.360 --> 1:45:11.040]  will be a book but but I need more substance I need more research rather
[1:45:11.040 --> 1:45:16.080]  than attitude but I hope every is will go on your listeners will go online look
[1:45:16.080 --> 1:45:20.720]  we desperately need donations we desperately need sponsors in order to
[1:45:20.720 --> 1:45:27.480]  move our our program out of you know out of San Francisco into the rest of the
[1:45:27.480 --> 1:45:32.360]  country because the message is really for all youth development it's a 4-H
[1:45:32.360 --> 1:45:38.320]  it's a bull scout girl scout summer camp because everything we do is based on
[1:45:38.320 --> 1:45:44.240]  fundamental social science research and we always have we evaluate and before
[1:45:44.240 --> 1:45:47.760]  you put a program out we say does it work you have pre post measures that we
[1:45:47.760 --> 1:45:52.200]  change information to be changed out of busy change value not only the kids but
[1:45:52.200 --> 1:45:56.600]  the teachers and their parents so it's really a unique unique program that I'm
[1:45:56.600 --> 1:46:02.400]  desperate to you know give away to the world well and I want to jump in and
[1:46:02.400 --> 1:46:06.320]  encourage people that if you're not tithing 10% of your income for liberty
[1:46:06.320 --> 1:46:10.080]  you've got to bear in mind that you're tithing between 20 and 60% of your
[1:46:10.080 --> 1:46:16.400]  income for tyranny in the form of your taxes so I yeah every every 10 every
[1:46:16.400 --> 1:46:19.960]  dollar that comes into my hands even if it's someone purchasing a product that
[1:46:19.960 --> 1:46:24.560]  I'm that I'm selling or if I'm in an event signing a book I take 10% before I
[1:46:24.560 --> 1:46:29.240]  even deduct the expense of the item and I set it aside and we my husband and I
[1:46:29.240 --> 1:46:32.840]  have a tithing account we have an envelope that we keep with cash in it
[1:46:32.840 --> 1:46:37.440]  we also just just started a bank account where literally 10% of every single penny
[1:46:37.440 --> 1:46:41.280]  that comes into our hands goes into there and it is available for causes like
[1:46:41.280 --> 1:46:46.520]  yours so expect to be receiving a donation from us dr. Zabarda we will yeah I
[1:46:46.520 --> 1:46:49.760]  really want to support where you're doing because you know so much of our
[1:46:49.760 --> 1:46:52.840]  money is going I know because I've been in the halls of power and seen the lobby
[1:46:52.840 --> 1:46:56.480]  is there the corporation certainly get that they lobby for their interests and
[1:46:56.480 --> 1:47:00.240]  they further their cause with money and they set aside a certain percentage of
[1:47:00.240 --> 1:47:03.480]  all their income to make sure that their interests are represented in Congress and
[1:47:03.480 --> 1:47:07.400]  in state capitals and we need to be doing the same across the board really
[1:47:07.400 --> 1:47:10.680]  fighting for liberty and goodness and I think that this is just a brilliant
[1:47:10.680 --> 1:47:14.040]  place to do that so to all the listeners I would just put out a challenge to you
[1:47:14.040 --> 1:47:18.640]  to begin to set aside 10% of your income you can you can dedicate it to a church
[1:47:18.640 --> 1:47:23.360]  to missions you can dedicate it to to liberty action secular efforts whatever
[1:47:23.360 --> 1:47:27.240]  it is that's bringing goodness into the world we've got to fund it otherwise it
[1:47:27.240 --> 1:47:30.640]  doesn't stand a chance against the forces of evil which have a lot of money
[1:47:30.640 --> 1:47:34.440]  ill-gotten gains they spend in that way alright let me go to the phone lines and
[1:47:34.440 --> 1:47:39.040]  take your questions and calls for my guest dr. Phillips in Bardo let us go
[1:47:39.040 --> 1:47:44.480]  ahead to Emily who is calling in from Tennessee hello Emily you're on with
[1:47:44.480 --> 1:47:53.440]  Phillips in Bardo go ahead hello I'm calling in on my mother she she's a
[1:47:53.440 --> 1:48:02.680]  prison parent TV member and we have been raised according to the word of God and
[1:48:02.680 --> 1:48:10.280]  Jeremiah 2 says the heart above all things is deceitful and desperately
[1:48:10.280 --> 1:48:19.960]  wicked who can know it so until a person is born again they really have no
[1:48:19.960 --> 1:48:26.440]  understanding about good or evil and we are really like sheep to the slaughter as
[1:48:26.440 --> 1:48:35.080]  Alex says sheeple to be you know thrown in front of the TV set which is you know
[1:48:35.080 --> 1:48:42.520]  the walking dead and basically pornography on even basic cable TV
[1:48:42.520 --> 1:48:47.760]  channels and people have you know they seem to have nothing else to do they
[1:48:47.760 --> 1:48:52.720]  don't want to read that it they don't seem to want to know well I'm I'm totally
[1:48:52.720 --> 1:48:56.400]  with you Emily because at the beginning of this hour when I said I hope I would
[1:48:56.400 --> 1:49:01.120]  never get into that situation I truly hope that my faith and in my efforts as
[1:49:01.120 --> 1:49:07.240]  a Christian to refine my heart and to to really try to be humble and kind and
[1:49:07.240 --> 1:49:11.400]  purge those sorts of things in my Christian walk would go a long way
[1:49:11.400 --> 1:49:16.400]  towards that let me ask our guest here dr. Zimbardo does faith and religion
[1:49:16.400 --> 1:49:21.560]  play a role in helping people to resist these kinds of societal forces it
[1:49:21.560 --> 1:49:26.680]  really should I mean essentially you know the first of all religions are
[1:49:26.680 --> 1:49:32.360]  repositories of morality morality is all about teaching people right from wrong
[1:49:32.360 --> 1:49:36.880]  and teaching people to do the good thing and to avoid the bad thing through
[1:49:36.880 --> 1:49:44.640]  this temptation the problem is more and more religion has less of an impact on
[1:49:44.640 --> 1:49:49.000]  our secular life that people go to church or rather in church they say
[1:49:49.000 --> 1:49:53.400]  prayers they get communion whatever and then they go back and are in a
[1:49:53.400 --> 1:49:58.680]  different world so so the question is how do you carry that goodness in your
[1:49:58.680 --> 1:50:03.760]  heart that kindness that compassion every day toward it toward everyone you
[1:50:03.760 --> 1:50:06.840]  know so if you're religious if you're Catholic if you're Christian you know
[1:50:06.840 --> 1:50:13.320]  you carry the message of Jesus that you know the least among you is is my
[1:50:13.320 --> 1:50:17.640]  child my son my daughter and so that's what we're really trying to promote not
[1:50:17.640 --> 1:50:22.040]  in the religious way with the localization project is every day make
[1:50:22.040 --> 1:50:25.880]  someone feel special every day this week start out by giving someone a
[1:50:25.880 --> 1:50:30.560]  compliment make eye contact shake their hand know their name give give a
[1:50:30.560 --> 1:50:34.320]  compliment and tell kids when was the last time you complimented a teacher
[1:50:34.320 --> 1:50:38.040]  almost never well it's good teacher what was the last time we complimented your
[1:50:38.040 --> 1:50:43.040]  mother on a good dinner on the bus driver so two compliments are a very
[1:50:43.040 --> 1:50:49.080]  simple tactic which we call as part of being a hero in training and that's
[1:50:49.080 --> 1:50:53.320]  gratitude yeah softening our hearts towards others reaching out in gratitude
[1:50:53.320 --> 1:50:56.760]  with compliments that is a beautiful way to start all right Emily thank you for

[1:55:24.880 --> 1:55:28.640]  brief with the questions let's go to george in canada kit george quickly your
[1:55:28.640 --> 1:55:29.880]  question for
[1:55:29.880 --> 1:55:32.280]  dr philip zimbardo go right ahead
[1:55:32.280 --> 1:55:36.360]  i just want to give an example how to break the mind that my mother was in
[1:55:36.360 --> 1:55:40.320]  germany from nineteen thirty eight to nineteen fifty is an american
[1:55:40.320 --> 1:55:44.040]  uh... as a result of that she got involved with the germans were too
[1:55:44.040 --> 1:55:48.040]  afraid to to break the mindset of the conditioning of the nazis created but
[1:55:48.040 --> 1:55:50.480]  she got them to basically help smuggle
[1:55:50.480 --> 1:55:53.320]  uh... jews out of germany and then after the war
[1:55:53.320 --> 1:55:56.920]  uh... uh... she knew eisenhower because she was part of the military
[1:55:56.920 --> 1:55:59.680]  occupation government and he's trying to starve
[1:55:59.680 --> 1:56:02.720]  children because he had worked out the whole country because he hated germans
[1:56:02.720 --> 1:56:03.640]  so badly
[1:56:03.640 --> 1:56:06.840]  and she broke the mindset of many military people and got the help of
[1:56:06.840 --> 1:56:07.720]  patent
[1:56:07.720 --> 1:56:11.320]  basically helped beat orphanages and stuff like that military people are so
[1:56:11.320 --> 1:56:12.400]  conditioned
[1:56:12.400 --> 1:56:17.040]  to to follow orders even if they're uh... just against every
[1:56:17.040 --> 1:56:20.800]  instinctive human being it's just you did it in both cases so it's possible to
[1:56:20.800 --> 1:56:22.040]  break the mindset
[1:56:22.040 --> 1:56:25.400]  since your mother's one of the heroes uh... dr zimbardo
[1:56:25.400 --> 1:56:29.280]  absolutely please send me please send me that information
[1:56:29.280 --> 1:56:32.040]  my email is d r zimbardo at gmail
[1:56:32.040 --> 1:56:35.840]  because that's exactly the kind of person who's a silent hero
[1:56:35.840 --> 1:56:37.920]  what she did is extraordinary
[1:56:37.920 --> 1:56:43.360]  on both sides uh... again it's it's following up with the the earlier
[1:56:43.360 --> 1:56:45.160]  uh... sad thing about
[1:56:45.160 --> 1:56:48.040]  somebody gives him orders to uh... workers in a
[1:56:48.040 --> 1:56:53.080]  in a home for the ages and not to give cpr and so it allows somebody to die
[1:56:53.080 --> 1:56:57.200]  you're right after the war there was a lot of hostility against germans
[1:56:57.200 --> 1:57:02.400]  and we were you know some of our leaders were willing to let them starve to death
[1:57:02.400 --> 1:57:05.840]  they were not necessarily not that there were people who followed
[1:57:05.840 --> 1:57:08.200]  their father's orders
[1:57:08.200 --> 1:57:11.960]  but we hear their stories but we don't always hear the stories of the heroes
[1:57:11.960 --> 1:57:15.280]  so george thank you for your call i i hope you can get in touch with dr zimbardo
[1:57:15.280 --> 1:57:17.960]  and and we can take that story to the next level
[1:57:17.960 --> 1:57:23.040]  uh... let's get a call in from let's see zoe in illinois zoe um... just quickly
[1:57:23.040 --> 1:57:24.840]  i think we've got about a minute left go ahead
[1:57:24.840 --> 1:57:27.680]  i i love that last call by the way um...
[1:57:27.680 --> 1:57:30.760]  i i i have my questions been asked to ignore it but um...
[1:57:30.760 --> 1:57:33.800]  i i have to ask mister zimbardo i read about this
[1:57:33.800 --> 1:57:37.280]  danford x prisoner experiment back when i was in college
[1:57:37.280 --> 1:57:40.040]  and it always bothered me that
[1:57:40.040 --> 1:57:43.560]  that somebody would do an experiment like this how do you how can you know you
[1:57:43.560 --> 1:57:44.880]  didn't damage
[1:57:44.880 --> 1:57:48.960]  the people that were involved in the experiment permanently or
[1:57:48.960 --> 1:57:52.360]  you know i i really bothered me to think that someone would do that i was i mean
[1:57:52.360 --> 1:57:54.880]  it was interesting i admit that uh...
[1:57:54.880 --> 1:57:59.080]  but i think the psychological damage thank you zoe uh... of of people going
[1:57:59.080 --> 1:58:00.520]  through that
[1:58:00.520 --> 1:58:05.400]  so it's it's very important to realize that in my book i have a great uh...

[2:00:37.560 --> 2:00:42.040]  and here with you writing shotgun all three hours today i will also be back
[2:00:42.040 --> 2:00:48.120]  with you again on friday as we together take a gander and the the not only the
[2:00:48.120 --> 2:00:52.280]  news that's going on out there but a little commentary and a little bit of
[2:00:52.280 --> 2:00:55.920]  uh... detangling and trying to understand how we got into this mess that
[2:00:55.920 --> 2:00:56.960]  we're in
[2:00:56.960 --> 2:01:00.720]  and of course is a bible-believing christian i like to say that this mess
[2:01:00.720 --> 2:01:05.120]  that we got into started way back when you know it it really seems like we are
[2:01:05.120 --> 2:01:07.960]  on board the titanic this is an analogy i gave
[2:01:07.960 --> 2:01:11.440]  last week when i was a guest on alex's show and if you didn't catch it i was
[2:01:11.440 --> 2:01:14.640]  there in the studio on video so you can actually see me
[2:01:14.640 --> 2:01:18.280]  i said today no not going to do that on video skype thank you all only that to
[2:01:18.280 --> 2:01:21.640]  alex but uh... i was in the studio so i did that live
[2:01:21.640 --> 2:01:25.480]  live video interview last week i'm sure you can find it at info wars on
[2:01:25.480 --> 2:01:26.960]  youtube and elsewhere
[2:01:26.960 --> 2:01:29.160]  but uh... one of the things that that
[2:01:29.160 --> 2:01:32.640]  people often ask how did we get into this mess you know it seems so much
[2:01:32.640 --> 2:01:35.760]  better in the fifties or it was so much better in the twenties or the eighteen
[2:01:35.760 --> 2:01:38.160]  hundreds man that's when it was perfect
[2:01:38.160 --> 2:01:41.320]  and of course the bible itself tells us king solemn
[2:01:41.320 --> 2:01:45.000]  one of the wisest guys ever says you know don't don't go longing for the old
[2:01:45.000 --> 2:01:47.920]  days and thinking they were better than today because they weren't
[2:01:47.920 --> 2:01:49.360]  but that's an error
[2:01:49.360 --> 2:01:52.720]  is interesting even back in his day how many thousands of years ago he was
[2:01:52.720 --> 2:01:55.000]  cautioning people oh yeah you've you thought
[2:01:55.000 --> 2:01:59.600]  that you thought twelve hundred bc was better than eleven fifty bc now it
[2:01:59.600 --> 2:02:00.800]  wasn't
[2:02:00.800 --> 2:02:03.240]  because of the battle that we're fighting
[2:02:03.240 --> 2:02:06.480]  is not you know it feels like it's a battle against technology and
[2:02:06.480 --> 2:02:10.600]  surveillance drones and and encroaching corporate
[2:02:10.600 --> 2:02:14.520]  uh... takeovers of the entire globe but but the reality is that the battle we're
[2:02:14.520 --> 2:02:18.720]  fighting is a spiritual battle and it is one that has raged in the hearts of men
[2:02:18.720 --> 2:02:20.400]  and around the hearts of men
[2:02:20.400 --> 2:02:22.640]  from the very beginning of time
[2:02:22.640 --> 2:02:25.360]  you can take it all the way back if you want to use uh... my analogy of the
[2:02:25.360 --> 2:02:26.560]  titanic
[2:02:26.560 --> 2:02:31.080]  that we struck an iceberg way back when in the garden of eden you know when
[2:02:31.080 --> 2:02:33.400]  when you took a bite out of that apple
[2:02:33.400 --> 2:02:36.680]  when you want to be that literally or metaphorically there was a deal that was
[2:02:36.680 --> 2:02:39.680]  struck in the deal said hey we don't want to what you've got
[2:02:39.680 --> 2:02:42.560]  god we want our own power we want power
[2:02:42.560 --> 2:02:45.120]  the knowledge of good and evil the power
[2:02:45.120 --> 2:02:46.720]  to be as gods
[2:02:46.720 --> 2:02:50.320]  and here we are kind of coming full circle in that aren't we because now we've
[2:02:50.320 --> 2:02:54.080]  got uh... the founders of google saying that they want to turn google into the
[2:02:54.080 --> 2:02:56.120]  mind of god
[2:02:56.120 --> 2:02:58.720]  that's actually a literal answer they gave what do you want to go to become
[2:02:58.720 --> 2:03:00.200]  guys in the future
[2:03:00.200 --> 2:03:01.920]  the mind of god
[2:03:01.920 --> 2:03:04.120]  like it
[2:03:04.120 --> 2:03:07.680]  hello did you really say that yeah so they want to be the mind of god they
[2:03:07.680 --> 2:03:09.800]  want to be inside of your head
[2:03:09.800 --> 2:03:13.880]  the same way that god is omniscient and omnipotent sees all things knows all
[2:03:13.880 --> 2:03:15.880]  things numbers there's a new ad
[2:03:15.880 --> 2:03:19.360]  knows when the sparrow every time a sparrow falls from the sky god knows it
[2:03:19.360 --> 2:03:20.040]  all
[2:03:20.040 --> 2:03:22.960]  and the folks over there at google they want to know it too they want to picture
[2:03:22.960 --> 2:03:26.320]  the front of your house in a picture of your backyard they want
[2:03:26.320 --> 2:03:28.120]  you know it's not just google
[2:03:28.120 --> 2:03:31.880]  it just happens that that that google happens to be the company right now
[2:03:31.880 --> 2:03:34.440]  that that is holding all the toys
[2:03:34.440 --> 2:03:39.320]  but you better believe the nsa and interpol and to the global
[2:03:39.320 --> 2:03:43.760]  banking elite and the pond scum that's what i call them that the scum that is
[2:03:43.760 --> 2:03:47.360]  risen to the top of the pond choking out the oxygen for the rest of us
[2:03:47.360 --> 2:03:49.500]  they want those same powers to
[2:03:49.500 --> 2:03:52.680]  these are not new powers that are being sought it's just we now have new
[2:03:52.680 --> 2:03:56.120]  technology to enable them to get the powers that they want to have over the
[2:03:56.120 --> 2:03:57.200]  rest of us
[2:03:57.200 --> 2:04:01.600]  and anytime you know it might make the the best definition of ever come up
[2:04:01.600 --> 2:04:02.920]  with for government
[2:04:02.920 --> 2:04:05.680]  is people who have sought power over others
[2:04:05.680 --> 2:04:07.200]  and obtained it
[2:04:07.200 --> 2:04:09.920]  and those are the very people that shouldn't have power if you think about
[2:04:09.920 --> 2:04:10.520]  it
[2:04:10.520 --> 2:04:14.640]  the people who we have given the power to and our money to between twenty and
[2:04:14.640 --> 2:04:18.000]  sixty percent of our income goes into their hands
[2:04:18.000 --> 2:04:22.400]  those are people who create power they thrive on it's it's like miracle grow
[2:04:22.400 --> 2:04:24.600]  to the weeds in your backyard
[2:04:24.600 --> 2:04:27.240]  when you give them money and you give them power
[2:04:27.240 --> 2:04:31.120]  and that is why you know this is an again it's not a new battle it's maybe a
[2:04:31.120 --> 2:04:32.340]  little bit new
[2:04:32.340 --> 2:04:33.620]  because we're the first
[2:04:33.620 --> 2:04:36.840]  generation or nation that's figured out how to try to thwart it and we're
[2:04:36.840 --> 2:04:38.320]  trying to hold on to that
[2:04:38.320 --> 2:04:41.960]  constitutional system of checks and balances but the battle's been raging
[2:04:41.960 --> 2:04:43.040]  for ever

[2:08:34.560 --> 2:08:38.240]  only gosh my brain is jammed full of irrelevant details and that can you
[2:08:38.240 --> 2:08:40.000]  imagine what we could do
[2:08:40.000 --> 2:08:43.360]  like what brainpower we would have if we took stuff like the fact that that song
[2:08:43.360 --> 2:08:47.920]  is called baker street by jerry rafferty and replaced it with oh i don't know
[2:08:47.920 --> 2:08:50.600]  maybe the literal text of the constitution
[2:08:50.600 --> 2:08:53.360]  why were they teaching me that when i was my teens
[2:08:53.360 --> 2:08:57.400]  all right a listen uh... i am like in case you don't know who this is this is
[2:08:57.400 --> 2:09:00.680]  dr kathryn alberg filling in for alex jones

[2:10:52.560 --> 2:10:58.240]  and uh... john rapaport is with me this hour he is the guy who takes a look at
[2:10:58.240 --> 2:11:02.360]  the news and gives it his own little twist in fact he sent
[2:11:02.360 --> 2:11:07.040]  and absolutely awesome email out yesterday remember we had uh... lennor
[2:11:07.040 --> 2:11:11.480]  skanesian show yesterday talking about that kid who ate the strawberry pop tart
[2:11:11.480 --> 2:11:13.800]  into the shape of what he thought was a mountain
[2:11:13.800 --> 2:11:16.080]  and his teacher thought it was a gun
[2:11:16.080 --> 2:11:19.400]  and suspended the kid for two days i shouldn't laugh i should be
[2:11:19.400 --> 2:11:24.000]  absolutely just lividly crying but john rapaport had some great responses
[2:11:24.000 --> 2:11:28.320]  to that and it is my joy to bring him on the show right now john hello welcome
[2:11:28.320 --> 2:11:30.400]  great to be here thanks for having me
[2:11:30.400 --> 2:11:34.080]  hey it's great to have you with me so uh... what what did you think about this
[2:11:34.080 --> 2:11:36.560]  strawberry pop tart i thought i loved
[2:11:36.560 --> 2:11:40.160]  your response calling for an armed insurrection let me let you share that
[2:11:40.160 --> 2:11:43.680]  with uh... with the list of other direction of all the kids
[2:11:43.680 --> 2:11:48.000]  in school taking all their charts and all making guns out of them
[2:11:48.000 --> 2:11:52.920]  and saying here we are you know this is strawberry tart rebellion
[2:11:52.920 --> 2:11:56.280]  so spend this kick us out get rid of this
[2:11:56.280 --> 2:11:57.560]  send us home
[2:11:57.560 --> 2:12:00.040]  will bring our parents back to school
[2:12:00.040 --> 2:12:04.200]  and our parents can talk to you to the school board and say
[2:12:04.200 --> 2:12:09.400]  you're completely and utterly and totally out of your mind
[2:12:09.400 --> 2:12:11.240]  and so therefore
[2:12:11.240 --> 2:12:15.200]  unless you rescind this policy and get some quick sanity
[2:12:15.200 --> 2:12:17.720]  we're going to take all the kids out of school
[2:12:17.720 --> 2:12:21.240]  permanently not suspended we're going to just take them out period that's it
[2:12:21.240 --> 2:12:23.240]  our kids are going to be removed
[2:12:23.240 --> 2:12:24.880]  from you lunatics
[2:12:24.880 --> 2:12:27.120]  we're going to start our own school
[2:12:27.120 --> 2:12:31.960]  and then you can figure out how to get federal dollars
[2:12:31.960 --> 2:12:35.200]  for every student that you don't have now in the school
[2:12:35.200 --> 2:12:37.920]  because you've obviously gone completely insane
[2:12:37.920 --> 2:12:39.680]  i mean that's what it takes
[2:12:39.680 --> 2:12:44.600]  see it's not just okay well they made a mistake they're incompetent somebody
[2:12:44.600 --> 2:12:45.640]  stupid
[2:12:45.640 --> 2:12:49.880]  no on a local level people have to stand up to these of fascists
[2:12:49.880 --> 2:12:51.800]  have to go there and they say okay
[2:12:51.800 --> 2:12:53.560]  this is a tart
[2:12:53.560 --> 2:12:55.080]  this is a gun
[2:12:55.080 --> 2:12:58.920]  that's right it's a gun i have a permit to carry it
[2:12:58.920 --> 2:13:02.560]  this is a tart and this is a gun you people are insane
[2:13:02.560 --> 2:13:06.120]  and we're going to draw the line in the sand here we're not going to permit you
[2:13:06.120 --> 2:13:08.760]  to do this to our children anymore
[2:13:08.760 --> 2:13:11.440]  and then in schools across the country
[2:13:11.440 --> 2:13:14.920]  you'll see more of that happening as people go to their school boards and they
[2:13:14.920 --> 2:13:15.640]  say
[2:13:15.640 --> 2:13:19.000]  oh yeah my kid brought a paper gun no it was a bubble gun
[2:13:19.000 --> 2:13:19.880]  remember that
[2:13:19.880 --> 2:13:23.160]  and then there was a lot of pistol and there was a picture of the gun
[2:13:23.160 --> 2:13:26.320]  and so we're going to take all of our kids out of school because you people
[2:13:26.320 --> 2:13:27.480]  are crazy
[2:13:27.480 --> 2:13:29.800]  yet no the hello kitty bubble gun
[2:13:29.800 --> 2:13:33.280]  not not bubble gum but the bubble gun that's uh... you know you you pull the
[2:13:33.280 --> 2:13:37.200]  trigger on the little pink plastic hello kitty and little bubbles fly out
[2:13:37.200 --> 2:13:40.360]  and a kid got suspended for that as well so you know when they're suspending
[2:13:40.360 --> 2:13:44.520]  kids for throwing fake grenades you know just pretending to pull the pin out
[2:13:44.520 --> 2:13:46.880]  of a grenade and and pretending to throw it
[2:13:46.880 --> 2:13:50.480]  sure to blow up the bad guys in a box because it's something the kids saw on
[2:13:50.480 --> 2:13:51.520]  a cartoon
[2:13:51.520 --> 2:13:56.160]  you know it it is sometimes i wonder and my degree actually my background is in
[2:13:56.160 --> 2:14:00.120]  human development and psychology and education so i spent a lot of years at
[2:14:00.120 --> 2:14:01.480]  harvard studying
[2:14:01.480 --> 2:14:06.160]  how kids develop and how their minds develop and how their their educational
[2:14:06.160 --> 2:14:09.960]  exposure shapes and molds them into what they become as adults
[2:14:09.960 --> 2:14:14.360]  and i can tell you even with all that training i have no preparation
[2:14:14.360 --> 2:14:18.040]  for even beginning to comprehend what happens to children
[2:14:18.040 --> 2:14:21.880]  who are exposed to this kind of nonsense from adults because if you're a six
[2:14:21.880 --> 2:14:23.640]  seven eight-year-old kid
[2:14:23.640 --> 2:14:27.520]  and you see that that that your classmate is being
[2:14:27.520 --> 2:14:29.880]  expelled suspended for two days
[2:14:29.880 --> 2:14:32.200]  for eating a pop chart into the wrong shape
[2:14:32.200 --> 2:14:36.080]  what does that teach you about the world what is it teach you about the
[2:14:36.080 --> 2:14:39.400]  adults around you do you just feel like the lunatics are running the asylum at
[2:14:39.400 --> 2:14:43.280]  that point yeah obviously kids would i mean i think every kid has had some
[2:14:43.280 --> 2:14:45.160]  kind of experience like that but
[2:14:45.160 --> 2:14:47.520]  see to me this is really
[2:14:47.520 --> 2:14:49.920]  not just a few isolated
[2:14:49.920 --> 2:14:52.880]  crazy teachers what's really happening here
[2:14:52.880 --> 2:14:53.640]  is
[2:14:53.640 --> 2:14:57.120]  they've had this whole plan on the drawing boards for a long time
[2:14:57.120 --> 2:15:02.000]  to take the guns to pass laws executive orders etc etc we got the media on our
[2:15:02.000 --> 2:15:03.200]  side
[2:15:03.200 --> 2:15:06.040]  but more than that with their good that what they're trying to do is change the
[2:15:06.040 --> 2:15:07.720]  culture the whole culture
[2:15:07.720 --> 2:15:11.280]  and you can look at other movements look at what happened back in the years when
[2:15:11.280 --> 2:15:13.240]  it was okay to wear fur
[2:15:13.240 --> 2:15:17.680]  and then all of a sudden not only was it not okay to wear fur but you were in
[2:15:17.680 --> 2:15:20.040]  danger if you were wearing fur when you walk down the street
[2:15:20.040 --> 2:15:24.040]  and the entire culture shifted now i'm saying that was a bad thing at all i'm
[2:15:24.040 --> 2:15:26.640]  just showing you how these things develop
[2:15:26.640 --> 2:15:28.440]  that's what they're trying to do with guns
[2:15:28.440 --> 2:15:30.360]  they want to change the whole culture
[2:15:30.360 --> 2:15:33.000]  so that if you just mention the word gun
[2:15:33.000 --> 2:15:37.800]  if you say the word gun if you write the word gun if you think the word gun
[2:15:37.800 --> 2:15:39.200]  then all of a sudden
[2:15:39.200 --> 2:15:42.960]  you are the outsider not just the outside you're the bad guy you're the
[2:15:42.960 --> 2:15:44.000]  criminal
[2:15:44.000 --> 2:15:49.360]  you're the potential terrorist you're the uh... prehistoric neanderthal
[2:15:49.360 --> 2:15:54.760]  who's still living uh... you know with guns and bitterly clinging to religion
[2:15:54.760 --> 2:15:57.880]  and out in the rural area somewhere in the hick
[2:15:57.880 --> 2:16:02.840]  land where the uneducated are you see that's what they're trying to do here
[2:16:02.840 --> 2:16:06.560]  they're trying to change the entire culture so that in the next five to ten
[2:16:06.560 --> 2:16:07.640]  years
[2:16:07.640 --> 2:16:10.800]  people will just go i don't know whether i should mention the word gun
[2:16:10.800 --> 2:16:14.320]  oh that might be bad oh that might be a terrible thing
[2:16:14.320 --> 2:16:16.520]  that's where all this is going
[2:16:16.520 --> 2:16:18.240]  and that's what you're trying to do
[2:16:18.240 --> 2:16:22.800]  i think you make a really interesting parallel here with firm because it was
[2:16:22.800 --> 2:16:24.400]  the case in fact my own
[2:16:24.400 --> 2:16:25.680]  grandfather
[2:16:25.680 --> 2:16:30.520]  was a main crancher that long before i was born but that that was how he uh...
[2:16:30.520 --> 2:16:34.360]  you know how he made a living and back in that era you know in the forties you
[2:16:34.360 --> 2:16:38.020]  can go back and read and see this on on the old movies
[2:16:38.020 --> 2:16:41.800]  having a mink was the ultimate expression of wealth and so everybody
[2:16:41.800 --> 2:16:43.680]  wanted a mink and it was
[2:16:43.680 --> 2:16:46.960]  an integrated part of american culture for good or bad you know i can make a
[2:16:46.960 --> 2:16:48.760]  judgment on that really either way
[2:16:48.760 --> 2:16:54.520]  but the the the way in which the culture so radically and dramatically changed
[2:16:54.520 --> 2:16:58.120]  to the point where i was in manhattan just a couple weeks ago and you know it's
[2:16:58.120 --> 2:17:01.040]  the dead of winter it's it's freezing cold in manhattan
[2:17:01.040 --> 2:17:04.640]  and i saw a woman in a full-length mink coat
[2:17:04.640 --> 2:17:08.160]  and rather than say well that's really a beautiful mink coat or rather than you
[2:17:08.160 --> 2:17:11.280]  know have some other thought wow she must be rich the first thought that went
[2:17:11.280 --> 2:17:14.120]  through my head is somebody's gonna throw paint on that woman
[2:17:14.120 --> 2:17:19.320]  so that the culture has been so thoroughly acculturated to to look at
[2:17:19.320 --> 2:17:20.080]  fur
[2:17:20.080 --> 2:17:23.280]  and have all of these negative images come up i think the other example we
[2:17:23.280 --> 2:17:25.360]  could look at john would be smoking
[2:17:25.360 --> 2:17:28.480]  that he used to be you know you look at the nineteen fifties in every movie you
[2:17:28.480 --> 2:17:31.560]  know kerry grant smoking a cigarette doors days smoking a cigarette
[2:17:31.560 --> 2:17:35.400]  everybody smoking and then now we've gotten to the point where the even the
[2:17:35.400 --> 2:17:39.040]  mention of cigarettes you know the the they can't advertise them they can't
[2:17:39.040 --> 2:17:42.560]  put him in the movies everybody is is anti-smoking
[2:17:42.560 --> 2:17:46.480]  so do you think that that kind of a change that kind of a cultural shift
[2:17:46.480 --> 2:17:49.880]  to where everybody just makes the sign of the cross and says get away from me
[2:17:49.880 --> 2:17:51.720]  with that cigarette or that for
[2:17:51.720 --> 2:17:56.080]  is that can happen with guns and and that's what they're trying to do
[2:17:56.080 --> 2:18:00.520]  i mean this is not going to be a slam dunk by any stretch of the imagination
[2:18:00.520 --> 2:18:02.960]  but this is the program
[2:18:02.960 --> 2:18:07.720]  this is the cultural program i mean look at gmail food for example
[2:18:07.720 --> 2:18:10.520]  when this was introduced by monsanto
[2:18:10.520 --> 2:18:12.000]  at first
[2:18:12.000 --> 2:18:15.760]  it was brought on with the idea well the fda says it's okay that's what
[2:18:15.760 --> 2:18:18.560]  monsanto said and then the fda said
[2:18:18.560 --> 2:18:22.240]  well ultimately it's up to the food producer to guarantee the safety of the
[2:18:22.240 --> 2:18:23.200]  food
[2:18:23.200 --> 2:18:27.440]  so the media didn't jump down on this contradiction and say hey wait a minute
[2:18:27.440 --> 2:18:28.400]  here
[2:18:28.400 --> 2:18:31.840]  this is a scam you're pulling here you're passing the buck to each other and
[2:18:31.840 --> 2:18:33.160]  all of a sudden
[2:18:33.160 --> 2:18:34.440]  we've got this
[2:18:34.440 --> 2:18:37.800]  new kind of genetically engineered food all over america
[2:18:37.800 --> 2:18:41.120]  so monsanto along with many of its allies
[2:18:41.120 --> 2:18:45.200]  began to do gigantic amounts of promotion to convince
[2:18:45.200 --> 2:18:47.240]  not so much the public you see
[2:18:47.240 --> 2:18:49.000]  but the educated
[2:18:49.000 --> 2:18:50.200]  classes
[2:18:50.200 --> 2:18:52.000]  the technocrats
[2:18:52.000 --> 2:18:53.400]  the scientists
[2:18:53.400 --> 2:18:56.080]  everybody in the scientific community
[2:18:56.080 --> 2:19:00.440]  was going to be convinced by monsanto we have the technology this is all about
[2:19:00.440 --> 2:19:04.680]  science the unwashed masses don't know anything about this they're crazy
[2:19:04.680 --> 2:19:06.440]  uh... forget about that
[2:19:06.440 --> 2:19:08.040]  so here's what we have to do
[2:19:08.040 --> 2:19:12.240]  you understand you people have to be opinion leaders and mold
[2:19:12.240 --> 2:19:16.240]  the opinion of the country you scientists you tech heads you people that
[2:19:16.240 --> 2:19:17.320]  understand

[2:19:37.280 --> 2:19:39.840]  and monsanto succeeded in that
[2:19:39.840 --> 2:19:42.360]  they succeeded in changing the culture
[2:19:42.360 --> 2:19:46.080]  of the technological and scientific classes in america
[2:19:46.080 --> 2:19:50.640]  so that these morons and idiots actually go along with the program

[2:25:08.320 --> 2:25:12.800]  some good news and lighten lighten the mood just a little bit on friday
[2:25:12.800 --> 2:25:17.120]  today though we're talking about the ways in which all of this propaganda
[2:25:17.120 --> 2:25:20.320]  swirls around us and changes the way we think about things
[2:25:20.320 --> 2:25:22.880]  and not only can they change the way we think about things that are
[2:25:22.880 --> 2:25:26.480]  maybe good for us like potentially the ability you know to
[2:25:26.480 --> 2:25:30.080]  have self-defense how about that one second amendment built right into the
[2:25:30.080 --> 2:25:34.080]  constitution they change it with propaganda and
[2:25:34.080 --> 2:25:38.080]  make it seem like it's a bad thing to care about the constitution or a bad
[2:25:38.080 --> 2:25:41.120]  thing to care about your privacy they also do the same thing on the other
[2:25:41.120 --> 2:25:44.400]  side where they take something that's utterly revolting like genetically
[2:25:44.400 --> 2:25:47.200]  modified foods is is our guest was talking about
[2:25:47.200 --> 2:25:51.520]  and change it around and and make it into a good thing or
[2:25:51.520 --> 2:25:54.880]  the idea of taking your kids and putting them into a government institution
[2:25:54.880 --> 2:25:59.600]  where they're practically in a straight jacket for 14 000 hours of seat
[2:25:59.600 --> 2:26:04.560]  time between kindergarten and twelfth grade 14 000 hours between 12 and 14
[2:26:04.560 --> 2:26:07.840]  000 hours our kids get indoctrinated in these government
[2:26:07.840 --> 2:26:11.440]  institutions but that's a good thing that's all about democracy
[2:26:11.440 --> 2:26:15.200]  well john rapaport i want to ask you when you were talking about this this
[2:26:15.200 --> 2:26:19.280]  um how they get the elite on board what i couldn't help but think about
[2:26:19.280 --> 2:26:24.000]  is the toilet to tap program now this is a program in southern california
[2:26:24.000 --> 2:26:27.840]  and elsewhere where they're trying to convince the public that it's okay
[2:26:27.840 --> 2:26:32.080]  to drink reclaimed sewage water toilet to tap
[2:26:32.080 --> 2:26:35.840]  is the phrase that they want to eradicate and instead they want to call it
[2:26:35.840 --> 2:26:40.080]  water reclamation is that part of the same propaganda
[2:26:40.080 --> 2:26:44.160]  message here and are they going to succeed with this kind of thing
[2:26:44.160 --> 2:26:47.520]  it is part of the same propaganda message
[2:26:47.520 --> 2:26:52.480]  i mean uh i would counter that by just showing a couple of dogs lapping water
[2:26:52.480 --> 2:26:55.200]  out of a toilet say is this what you are
[2:26:55.200 --> 2:26:59.200]  is this where you're going to drink from but uh yeah this is
[2:26:59.200 --> 2:27:02.080]  this is the same idea there isn't enough to go around
[2:27:02.080 --> 2:27:06.000]  oh no there's not enough to go around and so everybody has to conserve i mean
[2:27:06.000 --> 2:27:10.160]  jimmy carter tried that all those years ago and it was a total failure
[2:27:10.160 --> 2:27:15.280]  because the truth is is that there are saltwater conversion plants all over
[2:27:15.280 --> 2:27:18.800]  the world hundreds of them that convert saltwater freshwater
[2:27:18.800 --> 2:27:22.320]  and the only question has been about the cost of doing it
[2:27:22.320 --> 2:27:27.200]  well when an administration can waste trillions of dollars
[2:27:27.200 --> 2:27:33.360]  untold trillions on illegal illegitimate wars
[2:27:33.360 --> 2:27:37.120]  and buying billions of rounds of ammunition and so on and so forth we
[2:27:37.120 --> 2:27:41.600]  could all run it down for the next 12 days on how all this money
[2:27:41.600 --> 2:27:45.040]  is being stolen and spent and taken for people and so on
[2:27:45.040 --> 2:27:50.240]  you would think you would think that a federal government that cared at all
[2:27:50.240 --> 2:27:53.840]  would say gee i have an idea let's put up 15 to 20
[2:27:53.840 --> 2:27:58.480]  great saltwater conversion plants around the united states and the coast
[2:27:58.480 --> 2:28:01.920]  and we'll produce fresh water because the technology is there it's been there
[2:28:01.920 --> 2:28:04.400]  for a long time yeah it's going to cost a little bit
[2:28:04.400 --> 2:28:06.880]  extra maybe the government have to kick in a few
[2:28:06.880 --> 2:28:10.080]  subsidy bucks to make this happen with private companies
[2:28:10.080 --> 2:28:13.600]  we can have all the fresh water we want but no
[2:28:13.600 --> 2:28:17.440]  no no no no no no no no that's that's not part of the propaganda campaign
[2:28:17.440 --> 2:28:21.200]  you see because the propaganda campaign is aimed at convincing people
[2:28:21.200 --> 2:28:25.520]  that is all scarce we don't have well in and that's how it is terrible and you
[2:28:25.520 --> 2:28:28.880]  gotta let us take charge i think this fear mongering
[2:28:28.880 --> 2:28:32.320]  is is such a potent way to get people to give up their liberties if you say
[2:28:32.320 --> 2:28:35.680]  listen we're all gonna die then people say okay well
[2:28:35.680 --> 2:28:39.760]  do anything you can i'll do whatever you say just make that not happen and
[2:28:39.760 --> 2:28:42.960]  that's how you get agenda 21 that's how you get the takeovers
[2:28:42.960 --> 2:28:46.560]  uh... these public private partnerships that's how you end up with all of this
[2:28:46.560 --> 2:28:49.600]  um... i'd i'd just have to read this john because that this was blowing my
[2:28:49.600 --> 2:28:53.920]  mind here in arizona a case is current currently ongoing in the federal court
[2:28:53.920 --> 2:28:58.400]  over the use of this toilet to tap reclaimed water to make snow
[2:28:58.400 --> 2:29:02.960]  at a ski resort so this is in flagstaff the u.s forest services actually put up
[2:29:02.960 --> 2:29:05.760]  a sign telling people not to eat the snow
[2:29:05.760 --> 2:29:10.240]  even though it's safer skiing it's it's not safe for eating so just just had to
[2:29:10.240 --> 2:29:14.160]  throw that out there there's a lawsuit against it might have to be filed because
[2:29:14.160 --> 2:29:17.760]  of you fall on your face in the snow you're going to be eating the toilet
[2:29:17.760 --> 2:29:21.920]  you know what what it would have been an accident today and i fell in my face
[2:29:21.920 --> 2:29:25.120]  while i was skiing and then all of a sudden i got this infection
[2:29:25.120 --> 2:29:30.480]  i don't know what the connection is here but yeah exactly theory uh...
[2:29:30.480 --> 2:29:34.560]  avoid the snow in flagstaff all you folks out there in arizona

[2:36:28.400 --> 2:36:32.720]  and i had the privilege of being in the austin info wars studios
[2:36:32.720 --> 2:36:35.760]  last week and actually going into a little bit of overdrive
[2:36:35.760 --> 2:36:39.600]  it's kind of nice i've gotten some email by the way from listeners to alex's
[2:36:39.600 --> 2:36:41.680]  show and also listeners to my own radio show
[2:36:41.680 --> 2:36:44.720]  people writing in saying you know it's kind of nice on occasion
[2:36:44.720 --> 2:36:49.040]  you know to hear a woman's voice we've got melissa doing the evening news
[2:36:49.040 --> 2:36:53.280]  kind of bringing some women into the inner circle of the liberty movement
[2:36:53.280 --> 2:36:57.600]  and you know we we bring a difference maybe a little different approach
[2:36:57.600 --> 2:37:02.960]  but i gotta tell you that behind the the soft voice there's a big stick
[2:37:02.960 --> 2:37:06.480]  my latest battle just to keep you guys posted and up to date
[2:37:06.480 --> 2:37:11.280]  is against the rfid badges being worn around students next in san antonio
[2:37:11.280 --> 2:37:15.360]  texas that's where the school district there has required forty two hundred
[2:37:15.360 --> 2:37:19.840]  students to wear a remotely readable tracking beacon around their necks and
[2:37:19.840 --> 2:37:22.080]  no alex has been keeping you guys posted on that
[2:37:22.080 --> 2:37:26.000]  want to let you know that i am involved in a
[2:37:26.000 --> 2:37:30.320]  documentary video project on that we'd love to get some support from
[2:37:30.320 --> 2:37:34.400]  info wars listeners out there if you'd like to be a part of that you can contact
[2:37:34.400 --> 2:37:38.560]  me kma it's five chips dot com you can also check out our website at chip free
[2:37:38.560 --> 2:37:42.880]  schools dot com we're working with heather fozio from tag texas she's been a
[2:37:42.880 --> 2:37:45.760]  guest on the show in the past two good work happening down there
[2:37:45.760 --> 2:37:49.440]  i'm gonna be flying back out to san antonio in about a week
[2:37:49.440 --> 2:37:52.960]  and probably back there again at the end of the month so lots of travel in my
[2:37:52.960 --> 2:37:56.560]  future keep me in your prayers because that's a big battle if we don't stop it
[2:37:56.560 --> 2:38:00.960]  in san antonio that nasty program is going to spread across texas and then
[2:38:00.960 --> 2:38:04.080]  it's going to spread across the u.s then you're going to have every kid in the
[2:38:04.080 --> 2:38:06.880]  country having the expectation that government
[2:38:06.880 --> 2:38:10.640]  authorities have the right to literally monitor and record their location
[2:38:10.640 --> 2:38:13.600]  every twenty five seconds all day long
[2:38:13.600 --> 2:38:16.960]  we gotta stop it we gotta nip it in the bud and i need your help to do that
[2:38:16.960 --> 2:38:19.840]  all right john rapaport you know before the break we were talking about
[2:38:19.840 --> 2:38:24.880]  toilet to tap and gmo what are your views on on what they're doing to our
[2:38:24.880 --> 2:38:27.760]  kids because it really feels like the kids are in the crosshairs these days
[2:38:27.760 --> 2:38:32.640]  doesn't it absolutely that's the you know the
[2:38:32.640 --> 2:38:38.080]  traditional program is brainwash the kids get them involved
[2:38:38.080 --> 2:38:41.840]  get them to think that government is the great dispenser
[2:38:41.840 --> 2:38:47.360]  of everything good and that schools and government are really just one thing
[2:38:47.360 --> 2:38:52.720]  which they're turning out to be of course but it's the malleable brains and
[2:38:52.720 --> 2:38:57.920]  minds of the kids that they are working on here but i gotta tell you
[2:38:57.920 --> 2:39:04.400]  that when a kid sees and reads about and watches video of drones everywhere in
[2:39:04.400 --> 2:39:08.400]  the sky and tanks rolling down the streets of
[2:39:08.400 --> 2:39:13.280]  the united states u.s army tanks and so on and so forth
[2:39:13.280 --> 2:39:17.120]  these kids are going to get their own ideas because the one thing that the
[2:39:17.120 --> 2:39:20.640]  government can't do is you can't take the life
[2:39:20.640 --> 2:39:26.320]  out of a kid altogether and scratch his ability to rebel
[2:39:26.320 --> 2:39:30.160]  and i've seen that all over the place on the internet and i've seen it in my
[2:39:30.160 --> 2:39:33.840]  life because i used to teach school and private school
[2:39:33.840 --> 2:39:36.800]  and i watch what would happen to kids who were
[2:39:36.800 --> 2:39:40.800]  you know just ground under the heel of teachers counselors
[2:39:40.800 --> 2:39:46.560]  principals parents uh media the government etc etc etc
[2:39:46.560 --> 2:39:50.640]  and it was amazing what was going on under the surface
[2:39:50.640 --> 2:39:54.320]  what happens when you actually sit down with one of these kids
[2:39:54.320 --> 2:40:00.400]  they do not fold in all cases there are a lot of kids that come out of this
[2:40:00.400 --> 2:40:04.640]  cauldron when they get to be beyond adolescence
[2:40:04.640 --> 2:40:08.960]  they realize what's going on they realize this is a big control
[2:40:08.960 --> 2:40:14.000]  mechanism that we're dealing with here and if you're if you're
[2:40:14.000 --> 2:40:18.320]  expelling them for chewing their pop tarts into the wrong shape or or cutting
[2:40:18.320 --> 2:40:21.440]  out the letter l and holding it like a gun you know they're also going to grow
[2:40:21.440 --> 2:40:24.960]  up and think that they're they're living in a world of lunatics so clearly
[2:40:24.960 --> 2:40:28.080]  that's going to mess with them and i've seen it really go two different
[2:40:28.080 --> 2:40:31.760]  directions i'm sure you have as well where either the kids
[2:40:31.760 --> 2:40:35.520]  become completely rebellious and say forget all of this i don't want any
[2:40:35.520 --> 2:40:39.600]  part of any of it or they become completely discouraged and docile
[2:40:39.600 --> 2:40:43.360]  and on medication because they don't they keep they don't even have the
[2:40:43.360 --> 2:40:46.960]  the the whatever it takes to get through the day because they've been so beaten
[2:40:46.960 --> 2:40:50.640]  down and and they feel so extraordinarily discouraged
[2:40:50.640 --> 2:40:55.200]  so you know i think this is really where parents and adults caring adults
[2:40:55.200 --> 2:40:59.040]  grandparents and uncles neighbors brother sisters people who are
[2:40:59.040 --> 2:41:03.120]  are aware and alive and vibrant you know take a kid
[2:41:03.120 --> 2:41:06.720]  out take him out away from the video games take him away
[2:41:06.720 --> 2:41:10.720]  from the school for a day take him someplace to actually have some real
[2:41:10.720 --> 2:41:14.880]  life real world experiences and and let them you know feel the wind in their
[2:41:14.880 --> 2:41:18.320]  hair and the sun on their face because so many of these kids i mean they're
[2:41:18.320 --> 2:41:21.920]  living in this artificial world of madison avenue and television and
[2:41:21.920 --> 2:41:26.720]  video games and having uh... what was the statistic i read on on yesterday's
[2:41:26.720 --> 2:41:31.440]  program less than thirty minutes of meaningful conversation per week for
[2:41:31.440 --> 2:41:34.160]  the average adolescent male in this country
[2:41:34.160 --> 2:41:37.040]  with their parents less than thirty minutes a week and if they're not
[2:41:37.040 --> 2:41:40.240]  talking to their parents they're not talking to any other adults either
[2:41:40.240 --> 2:41:43.920]  and it was coming up right on the horizon in two months we're going to see
[2:41:43.920 --> 2:41:47.360]  the issue of a new bible out of the psychiatric profession
[2:41:47.360 --> 2:41:50.880]  it's called the dsm i've written about it a lot before
[2:41:50.880 --> 2:41:55.200]  it's the whole list of all the officially certified mental disorders
[2:41:55.200 --> 2:41:58.640]  and kids are going to be a major target of this
[2:41:58.640 --> 2:42:02.880]  because definitions are going to be expanded to allow more kids to be
[2:42:02.880 --> 2:42:06.240]  diagnosed with adhd bipolar depression
[2:42:06.240 --> 2:42:10.240]  oppositional defiance disorder these are all made up crap
[2:42:10.240 --> 2:42:14.480]  definitions that don't correspond to anything in reality at all
[2:42:14.480 --> 2:42:18.640]  they're not based on any science whatsoever there are no diagnostic tests
[2:42:18.640 --> 2:42:24.000]  for any psychiatric disorder no blood tests no saliva test no brain scan or
[2:42:24.000 --> 2:42:28.000]  genetic tests i've shown that evidence time and time again
[2:42:28.000 --> 2:42:32.320]  the whole profession is a complete fraud and what's going to happen with the
[2:42:32.320 --> 2:42:37.120]  new issue of this bible is that they're going to go after these
[2:42:37.120 --> 2:42:40.560]  kids in a way that you've never seen before in public schools
[2:42:40.560 --> 2:42:45.200]  well let me jump in with these disorders and drugging the life of
[2:42:45.200 --> 2:42:48.000]  yeah let me let me jump in for just a second john because i've got a question
[2:42:48.000 --> 2:42:51.600]  for you when when you talk about the the people putting out this manual are you
[2:42:51.600 --> 2:42:55.680]  talking about the psychiatrist or the psychologist because i think it's a
[2:42:55.680 --> 2:42:59.520]  different psychiatric association is a publisher of
[2:42:59.520 --> 2:43:04.800]  the dsm the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders
[2:43:04.800 --> 2:43:07.840]  because the reason i i think it's important to make that distinction the
[2:43:07.840 --> 2:43:11.760]  psychiatrist are medical doctors who prescribe drugs if you go to see a
[2:43:11.760 --> 2:43:15.040]  psychiatrist for whatever emotional problem you're
[2:43:15.040 --> 2:43:17.440]  having you will leave with a prescription in your hand
[2:43:17.440 --> 2:43:21.200]  if you go to see a psychologist on the other hand in my own background is in
[2:43:21.200 --> 2:43:23.280]  psychology human development and psychology
[2:43:23.280 --> 2:43:27.680]  our guest in the last hour dr philip zimbardo a psychologist who's used his
[2:43:27.680 --> 2:43:32.400]  understanding of human behavior to try to promote heroism and goodness
[2:43:32.400 --> 2:43:36.240]  i i don't want to paint all the psychologists with with a bad brush
[2:43:36.240 --> 2:43:39.600]  because i'm talking about psychiatrists doing good stuff that's what i'm talking
[2:43:39.600 --> 2:43:43.200]  about here and the thing about the schools as you see
[2:43:43.200 --> 2:43:48.960]  that through their counselors the kid is going to get referred to a psychiatrist
[2:43:48.960 --> 2:43:53.280]  that's what's going to happen because that's where the diagnosis is made and
[2:43:53.280 --> 2:43:56.320]  that's what these schools are all tuned up to do
[2:43:56.320 --> 2:44:01.040]  by the government we want more diagnoses and the more diagnoses
[2:44:01.040 --> 2:44:04.160]  of these mental disorders you get coming out of the schools
[2:44:04.160 --> 2:44:06.800]  the more federal money pours into the schools
[2:44:06.800 --> 2:44:10.000]  and the more drugs are dispensed and these kids are
[2:44:10.000 --> 2:44:15.360]  drugged with killer toxic compounds all the way from the adh drugs like riddle
[2:44:15.360 --> 2:44:19.440]  and anadrol to valproate and lithium for bipolar
[2:44:19.440 --> 2:44:24.240]  which can actually kill you so this is what we're seeing is the vast
[2:44:24.240 --> 2:44:27.920]  increase of the drugging of kids at a younger and younger age
[2:44:27.920 --> 2:44:33.120]  by psychiatrists and the schools although yes they have psychologists on staff
[2:44:33.120 --> 2:44:37.440]  where that they're connected with ultimately the machine pushes these
[2:44:37.440 --> 2:44:41.840]  kids into psychiatrist's offices where the diagnoses are made and the drugs
[2:44:41.840 --> 2:44:44.560]  are given and if the parents are clueless
[2:44:44.560 --> 2:44:47.280]  this kid is going to be destroyed for the rest of his life
[2:44:47.280 --> 2:44:50.320]  well and it's no surprise too because we weren't made for that kind of
[2:44:50.320 --> 2:44:54.400]  environment so you try to jam kids into a sit down
[2:44:54.400 --> 2:44:57.760]  be still don't move and and i you know childhood
[2:44:57.760 --> 2:45:02.000]  adolescents are the two times when when people should most be active and
[2:45:02.000 --> 2:45:06.640]  here we are forcing them to sit in a chair and then label them as somehow
[2:45:06.640 --> 2:45:10.720]  uh... ill or or maladjusted if they can't do it i i would almost say that
[2:45:10.720 --> 2:45:13.520]  the kid who's able to sit in a chair and follow the rules and keep their
[2:45:13.520 --> 2:45:16.640]  mouth shut for eight hours a day fourteen thousand hours between
[2:45:16.640 --> 2:45:20.800]  kindergarten and in high school you know that a kid who's able to do that is

[2:45:36.800 --> 2:45:39.520]  undoubtedly he's on riddle and you see because
[2:45:39.520 --> 2:45:43.760]  oh he's got other interests than what's going on in the classroom so he must be
[2:45:43.760 --> 2:45:48.320]  sick so we have to diagnose him yeah the kid is a talented painter
[2:45:48.320 --> 2:45:52.560]  so he's bored he's sitting there and he starts fooling around biting pieces out
[2:45:52.560 --> 2:45:55.440]  of a strawberry tart and all of a sudden teacher says
[2:45:55.440 --> 2:45:59.040]  hey that looks like a gun we got to suspend you from school
[2:45:59.040 --> 2:46:04.800]  that teacher is mentally ill yeah and they're sending a message to the kid

[2:54:35.680 --> 2:54:39.200]  breeze just a little bit with john rapapour new more fake news is his
[2:54:39.200 --> 2:54:42.320]  website just before the break we got a question coming in from a caller who i
[2:54:42.320 --> 2:54:45.920]  think has dropped off to hear the answer on the air but
[2:54:45.920 --> 2:54:49.440]  the question being is is patients a learned skill
[2:54:49.440 --> 2:54:53.520]  and the answer to that is that that human beings go through some pretty
[2:54:53.520 --> 2:54:57.200]  well-defined phases like all of us go through the same
[2:54:57.200 --> 2:55:00.480]  phases of development through certain years of early childhood
[2:55:00.480 --> 2:55:03.680]  and you can really mess those up if you if you're not careful but
[2:55:03.680 --> 2:55:08.160]  yes patients is indeed one of them where we learn how to moderate our behavior
[2:55:08.160 --> 2:55:11.120]  you know if you if you look at a little kid they don't get their way and they
[2:55:11.120 --> 2:55:14.400]  immediately burst into tears and you like to look at you like to think that
[2:55:14.400 --> 2:55:18.000]  adults don't get their way and and we're a little more strategic about how we
[2:55:18.000 --> 2:55:21.600]  respond to things than children and yes caller you were
[2:55:21.600 --> 2:55:25.520]  absolutely right that it can be the help of an adult you know normally a parent
[2:55:25.520 --> 2:55:28.800]  or a caring adult that's that's a member of your inner circle
[2:55:28.800 --> 2:55:32.320]  who can kind of shake you by the hand and and guide you through those periods of
[2:55:32.320 --> 2:55:35.680]  time that's normally the role of parents now we're putting it out to the
[2:55:35.680 --> 2:55:38.960]  schools but teachers don't have time to do that for 35 kids
[2:55:38.960 --> 2:55:41.840]  you know my mom is a school teacher in the los angeles schools
[2:55:41.840 --> 2:55:46.240]  she has over 150 kids in her caseload i said to her mom how can you even know
[2:55:46.240 --> 2:55:49.360]  their names much less have an opportunity to sit there
[2:55:49.360 --> 2:55:53.120]  and and and help each one of them with their individual issues and each of
[2:55:53.120 --> 2:55:57.680]  those kids has six different teachers each of those teachers has 150 kids so
[2:55:57.680 --> 2:56:00.640]  yeah unless the parents are really stepping in and doing it
[2:56:00.640 --> 2:56:03.760]  it's no wonder that the the schools are saying yeah let's let's take them on
[2:56:03.760 --> 2:56:07.120]  drugs ceiling it's the only thing we can do we don't have the resources to do
[2:56:07.120 --> 2:56:10.080]  anything else so that's where they're being drugs you don't see
[2:56:10.080 --> 2:56:14.560]  homeschooled kids being prescribed these kinds of medications because homeschooled
[2:56:14.560 --> 2:56:19.360]  kids are given the the the helping hand by the adults to get through those
[2:56:19.360 --> 2:56:23.440]  troubles now all right let's see if we can fit in one or two more phone calls
[2:56:23.440 --> 2:56:28.800]  let's go to let's see we got uh... mona listening in connecticut

[2:56:41.440 --> 2:56:48.720]  um it's uh pretty much a norm for the kids to have all these cell phones and
[2:56:48.720 --> 2:56:54.000]  smartphones and now they're getting more and more linked into the school
[2:56:54.000 --> 2:56:57.360]  system according to what my aunt has told me
[2:56:57.360 --> 2:57:02.000]  so my question is is um is it really my place
