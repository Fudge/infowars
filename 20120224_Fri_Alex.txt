[00:00.000 --> 00:12.360]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.360 --> 00:38.280]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:38.280 --> 00:44.880]  coming to you from Florida I'm on the road broadcasting world wide on over a
[00:44.880 --> 00:50.440]  hundred AM and FM affiliates simulcasting on XM channel 166 and of
[00:50.440 --> 00:55.160]  course blasting out via the internet at prisonplanet.com prisonplanet.tv and
[00:55.160 --> 01:00.200]  info wars.com I'm Alex Jones your host and we're gonna be live here for the
[01:00.200 --> 01:06.560]  next three hours now in studio back in Austin Texas today we're gonna have
[01:06.560 --> 01:13.280]  sheriff Richard Mack in studio so he'll be sitting in my seat for those that are
[01:13.280 --> 01:19.160]  watching prisonplanet.tv and breaking down the huge success with his idea to
[01:19.160 --> 01:25.600]  get hundreds of sheriffs together out in Colorado last month and to have them
[01:25.600 --> 01:30.440]  discuss standing up against the out-of-control federal expansion and
[01:30.440 --> 01:34.520]  power grab that's going on the usurpation of our republic and this is sent
[01:34.520 --> 01:38.640]  the ADL Southern Poverty Law Center federal government Denver post into
[01:38.640 --> 01:46.880]  conniption fits that the sheriffs may actually through the people of law try
[01:46.880 --> 01:50.920]  to reclaim their jurisdiction and power from the foreign banks that have
[01:50.920 --> 01:54.840]  objected nations through the criminal federal government also as you know he's
[01:54.840 --> 01:59.640]  suing the Southern Poverty Law Center for saying that he's called their violence
[01:59.640 --> 02:05.920]  against police which is comical I mean anybody that knows sheriff Mack knows
[02:05.920 --> 02:10.000]  that's ridiculous and he kept telling them you better retract this and when
[02:10.000 --> 02:14.880]  they finally did it wasn't to the full extent and so he's suing them we'll see
[02:14.880 --> 02:21.800]  how that lawsuit is going you know the ADL's lost lawsuits before the ADL was
[02:21.800 --> 02:28.680]  set up of course to defend a group of gangsters who were getting in trouble
[02:28.680 --> 02:31.840]  and then they would just politically go after anybody that went after the group
[02:31.840 --> 02:36.600]  of organized criminals you can look that up and think of the ADL let's say it's
[02:36.600 --> 02:42.000]  a historical fact but somehow they train the police department so the
[02:42.000 --> 02:44.880]  Southern Poverty Law Center they get to write up the reports the feds then get
[02:44.880 --> 02:48.360]  the local departments demonizing constitutionalist the founding fathers
[02:48.360 --> 02:53.880]  Ron Paul you read these reports they're very cartoonish but it actually creates
[02:53.880 --> 02:57.520]  a self-fulfilling prophecy when the police then go out and attack
[02:57.520 --> 03:02.520]  constitutionalist or go out and engage constitutionalist from a perspective of
[03:02.520 --> 03:07.480]  somebody's an enemy and then they actually get a fight back and I hope you
[03:07.480 --> 03:12.400]  stay on the air here there is it just a typhoon level storm heading right now
[03:12.400 --> 03:16.360]  and lightning and thunder I don't know if you can hear that but we had a pretty
[03:16.360 --> 03:23.560]  good connection yesterday here in Florida we hope it hope it continues but it's
[03:23.560 --> 03:27.640]  simple if I walked up to somebody walking down the street and bowed up to
[03:27.640 --> 03:32.400]  them and acted aggressive they probably both back up I've seen people that have
[03:32.400 --> 03:34.960]  bad attitudes in life and think everybody's out to get them and they
[03:34.960 --> 03:38.320]  just they just get along with nobody because it's almost what they're looking
[03:38.320 --> 03:42.960]  for it's it's what they're expecting and so I've got a better idea how about the
[03:42.960 --> 03:47.200]  American people and the police the military not beat each other's throats
[03:47.200 --> 03:53.720]  and just sit back take a deep breath and really look at who runs the federal
[03:53.720 --> 03:57.440]  government and who is preparing these reports that they're giving you now the
[03:57.440 --> 04:02.680]  military I know is woken up to the great extent they're awake and and the rest
[04:02.680 --> 04:06.280]  of them are waking up fast the police are starting to wake up it's not as fast
[04:06.280 --> 04:11.560]  moving or as deep as with the military but it will happen thanks to all of your
[04:11.560 --> 04:15.080]  work out there I mean I talked to a lot of people you know who actually have
[04:15.080 --> 04:19.080]  Ron Paul stickers on their cars and the police tell them all right your speed
[04:19.080 --> 04:23.280]  and here's a warning by the way I like your Ron Paul sticker and I've
[04:23.280 --> 04:26.880]  experienced things like that myself I mean I'm not really somebody who even is
[04:26.880 --> 04:30.680]  bashing a police I'm bashing police that are out of the jurisdiction out of
[04:30.680 --> 04:35.320]  their authority who are on power trips who who are crazed or who are so scared
[04:35.320 --> 04:42.200]  of the public that they that they constantly turn not even all hills in
[04:42.200 --> 04:46.640]  the mountains and this is the current models anyway I've gotten the news huge
[04:46.640 --> 04:51.760]  broadcast coming up huge news on Obama pitching the race card and more right
[04:51.760 --> 04:55.400]  here in Florida it's all coming out the state that this will be right back big
[04:55.400 --> 05:03.160]  transmission this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider
[05:03.160 --> 05:07.560]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[05:07.560 --> 05:11.600]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[05:11.600 --> 05:15.480]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[05:15.480 --> 05:20.000]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[05:20.000 --> 05:24.280]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[05:24.280 --> 05:28.440]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[05:28.440 --> 05:32.760]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[05:32.760 --> 05:36.440]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[05:36.440 --> 05:40.640]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[05:40.640 --> 05:44.000]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution

[10:14.080 --> 10:18.440]  demographics number one another testament to the power of liberty that's
[10:18.440 --> 10:21.040]  part of the show like this yesterday so I'm gonna give him to the news right now
[10:21.040 --> 10:24.840]  I'm gonna have a talk show host who I've been on the show five or six times in
[10:24.840 --> 10:30.500]  the past named Doc Holliday on I was on his radio show right before this one
[10:30.500 --> 10:35.160]  this morning on 8 10 our affiliate he's a local show and he was saying do you
[10:35.160 --> 10:39.440]  know about the riot over the latest Nike tennis shoes at the Orlando Mall I
[10:39.440 --> 10:44.040]  said no and he sent me a link to it and he said do you know about Obama and
[10:44.040 --> 10:48.520]  his African Americans for Obama I said yeah I saw that announcement two weeks
[10:48.520 --> 10:54.000]  ago and he said well they're airing that here in Orlando on TV and there's
[10:54.000 --> 10:58.400]  incredible racial tension and fights breaking out and riots and things and
[10:58.400 --> 11:03.400]  I sure enough went and looked it up it's true and he said it was completely a
[11:03.400 --> 11:08.720]  racial thing with the NBA all-stars game there yesterday and that when Obama
[11:08.720 --> 11:17.760]  was in town for $30,000 a person plates and he snubbed the the local Daytona
[11:17.760 --> 11:23.360]  500 event and that they even blocked off a lot of the area around where the
[11:23.360 --> 11:28.840]  all-stars played and blocked roads off major roads coming in only for the VIP
[11:28.840 --> 11:34.760]  Obama people so the new the royalty and the globalist love to use any event not
[11:34.760 --> 11:38.720]  just G 20 or NATO events to lock everything down and have checkpoints
[11:38.720 --> 11:43.440]  and act like it's the end of the world that happened but by having that talk
[11:43.440 --> 11:47.440]  show host point this out to me I did some more research this morning and went
[11:47.440 --> 11:53.600]  back to the subsection of Barack Obama's presidential website which is
[11:53.600 --> 11:58.640]  African Americans for Obama and I was completely blown away that I saw this
[11:58.640 --> 12:03.560]  two weeks ago when it first was put on YouTube now it's being aired on TV and
[12:03.560 --> 12:11.800]  it is absolutely totally 110% illegal what Obama is doing you you just heard
[12:11.800 --> 12:18.880]  me right it is totally and completely illegal what he is doing I'm gonna tell
[12:18.880 --> 12:23.000]  you here exactly what he's doing in just a moment the first I want to mention
[12:23.000 --> 12:26.480]  some of the other news that's coming up and I'm gonna tell you how it's illegal
[12:26.480 --> 12:30.760]  here in just a moment no no not saying African Americans for Obama that's not
[12:30.760 --> 12:36.000]  illegal we know what that is though I mean imagine white people for Mitt Romney
[12:36.000 --> 12:41.200]  I mean it would be the end of the world or that's not what's illegal that's just
[12:41.200 --> 12:45.880]  racial division you know gangsterism you know when any group goes out and makes
[12:45.880 --> 12:50.040]  it all about race that's that's that's Balkanization and it's coming from the
[12:50.040 --> 12:54.440]  Democrats from the multiculturalist who sell multiculturalism as a way to
[12:54.440 --> 12:59.720]  actually Balkanize people in the name of unity that's not what's illegal I'm
[12:59.720 --> 13:02.840]  gonna explain it here in just a moment because the video is amazing we're
[13:02.840 --> 13:05.600]  gonna play the video air the audio here for the radio audience if you're a
[13:05.600 --> 13:11.520]  radio listener I've got Paul Watson article on this right now it'll be up
[13:11.520 --> 13:15.240]  in the next hour at info wars.com I'll give you the video title you want to find
[13:15.240 --> 13:19.440]  it for yourself as a radio listener on XM channel 166 or however you're
[13:19.440 --> 13:24.800]  listening now after I go over that this dog holidays gonna be popping in
[13:24.800 --> 13:32.600]  Insider says talk of Paul Romney alliance is establishment trick
[13:32.600 --> 13:34.800]  Adam
[13:34.800 --> 13:37.800]  He can
[13:37.800 --> 13:42.760]  made the points that I've made for two hours before he came on that of course is
[13:42.760 --> 13:46.600]  the guy that first got Ron Baldwin for office the guy that ran his campaign the
[13:46.600 --> 13:50.720]  guy that was his chief of staff in Congress Lou Rockwell and it worked for
[13:50.720 --> 13:55.160]  Barry Goldwater worked for Barry Goldwater so you want to find out who
[13:55.160 --> 14:00.720]  went out and farmed Ron Paul and found that great mind Lou Rockwell and you
[14:00.720 --> 14:05.680]  know Lou publishes newsletters all of it Lou agreed he said yeah it's about
[14:05.680 --> 14:11.960]  making Ron Paul look like he's establishment sellout to people just
[14:11.960 --> 14:14.360]  like they tried to claim he's always flying first class and it turned out
[14:14.360 --> 14:17.560]  that wasn't even true even though congressman can get it paid for first
[14:17.560 --> 14:22.120]  class he refuses and doesn't but then he gets so many airline miles they bump
[14:22.120 --> 14:26.240]  him up I've flown before on America don't even fly that much they're like oh
[14:26.240 --> 14:30.520]  you've flown three times with us this year you're bumped up to first class so
[14:30.520 --> 14:35.560]  they found that and said you fly first class on taxpayer money when it's paid
[14:35.560 --> 14:38.880]  for to fly back and forth from your district in first class he won't even
[14:38.880 --> 14:42.880]  do that and that they said he did and said he was a liar and of course it
[14:42.880 --> 14:46.280]  turned out it wasn't true and even MSNBC had to retract themselves the point is
[14:46.280 --> 14:50.320]  they're they're looking for crooked toenail type stuff I mean you've got
[14:50.320 --> 14:54.480]  open crime being committed you've got all this corruption going on you've got
[14:54.480 --> 14:58.920]  all of this out of control new order behavior the illegal wars the torture
[14:58.920 --> 15:03.400]  the trillions being stolen by mega banks the NDAA the abolition of the
[15:03.400 --> 15:08.080]  rights and constitution open calls for internet censorship total federalization
[15:08.080 --> 15:15.480]  of local police Rome is burning the Titanic is sinking and they're out
[15:15.480 --> 15:21.920]  talking about Ron Paul didn't wipe his nose properly once or once he talked
[15:21.920 --> 15:26.720]  with his mouth full or once you know he didn't say please or thank you or he
[15:26.720 --> 15:30.520]  didn't carry an old lady's groceries across the street fast enough this is
[15:30.520 --> 15:35.440]  the type of stuff they're doing and so Rockwell completely concurred my
[15:35.440 --> 15:41.360]  analysis he said it is all about trying to get people in the Paul campaign to
[15:41.360 --> 15:45.480]  actually on the general public to some of them to actually clamor for it and then
[15:45.480 --> 15:49.000]  that will actually create the illusion that Paul himself is for it and then
[15:49.000 --> 15:53.560]  be a Republican insiders offering jobs to people that work for Paul you know
[15:53.560 --> 15:57.240]  all that's going on that does go on
[15:59.200 --> 16:07.600]  on Paul's supporters oh Romney likes Ron Paul well he can't be that bad then you
[16:07.600 --> 16:11.520]  see so that's what's going on and we had a whole discussion about it from about
[16:11.520 --> 16:15.880]  half the show on yesterday I think it was worthwhile but but my instinct is
[16:15.880 --> 16:21.680]  is is lose instinct and I'm into shoot a video yesterday just a special comment
[16:21.680 --> 16:26.040]  but I'll do it now you mark my word just like I told you Ron Paul would run
[16:26.040 --> 16:30.920]  Rand Paul would run just like I told you you've run four years ago just like I
[16:30.920 --> 16:34.520]  broke all this down just like I told you there'd be election fraud too but still
[16:34.520 --> 16:44.000]  by running he educates people we win by resisting we show how it's all fraud by
[16:44.000 --> 16:47.440]  resisting that's that's another step when you quit fighting that's when you're
[16:47.440 --> 16:52.280]  dying when you're fighting that's when you're living and getting stronger what
[16:52.280 --> 16:55.920]  is pain it's weakness leaving the body what is political pain it's weakness
[16:55.920 --> 16:58.880]  leaving the body when somebody makes funny you because your political views
[16:58.880 --> 17:03.440]  you don't get your feelings hurt you take satisfaction in the fact that you're
[17:03.440 --> 17:06.640]  out there being attacked that you've got courage that you've got strength you've
[17:06.640 --> 17:11.280]  got moral authority you've got moral courage it people say oh isn't it
[17:11.280 --> 17:15.320]  terrible to be demonizing attack no I love it not because I'm a glutton for
[17:15.320 --> 17:21.280]  punishment no these bullies are attacking me and demonizing and lying
[17:21.280 --> 17:26.160]  about me from from above and below through co-intel pro and through
[17:26.160 --> 17:30.560]  national media and government levels because I'm hurting them and I'm gonna
[17:30.560 --> 17:35.280]  go on hurting them so even though I don't at a certain level enjoy it I've
[17:35.280 --> 17:40.760]  even learned to enjoy it at a personal level because I know it's a sign of of
[17:40.760 --> 17:46.360]  of a victory not that I'm in good shape but I've gotten a little bit better shape
[17:46.360 --> 17:50.600]  and I finally got that point when I hit about five miles running where it's
[17:50.600 --> 17:54.720]  really painful and I feel nauseous and I just run through it and then and then I
[17:54.720 --> 17:58.240]  can just run and run and run and it's kind of like that politically you've
[17:58.240 --> 18:03.040]  got to get to where you like back when I used to lift weights a lot and I'm
[18:03.040 --> 18:09.080]  sitting there trying to bench press 230 pounds 20 times and at 10 you
[18:09.080 --> 18:12.400]  think you can't go anymore you just say I'm gonna do this another 10 times and
[18:12.400 --> 18:17.200]  by the last time you do it it is super painful but it feels so good when you
[18:17.200 --> 18:21.200]  walk out of that gym you've got so many endorphins flowing through you you think
[18:21.200 --> 18:26.480]  you're on cloud nine and it's the same thing the only thing worth anything in
[18:26.480 --> 18:31.480]  life is what comes hard what comes easy you never appreciate it's just that
[18:31.480 --> 18:36.240]  simple in life things that come hard and things that are valuable things that
[18:36.240 --> 18:40.640]  are good for society your gut will tell you this is good what you've done and
[18:40.640 --> 18:45.320]  and and it's literally your subconscious your basic human programming says you
[18:45.320 --> 18:48.640]  ought to feel satisfied right now you know even if you're told something you're
[18:48.640 --> 18:52.560]  doing is good but doesn't feel right let's say your police officer working for
[18:52.560 --> 18:57.440]  the system and you do something and it they tell you it's good but it doesn't
[18:57.440 --> 19:02.520]  feel right there's a reason it doesn't feel right your brain is conservatively
[19:02.520 --> 19:06.400]  hundreds of times more powerful than your conscious mind your conscious mind
[19:06.400 --> 19:11.760]  is only a limited focus of your overall intellect and if your gut that's what
[19:11.760 --> 19:16.680]  you call it your nose whatever says I don't like this we better really than
[19:16.680 --> 19:20.600]  intellectually think about it and then you'll get the answers you've got to
[19:20.600 --> 19:25.040]  examine why you're not getting a good feeling see you get a good feeling from
[19:25.040 --> 19:29.480]  something I don't mean a good feeling like sex or or partying those are
[19:29.480 --> 19:32.160]  bestial low-level good feelings I mean if you're not getting a good feeling
[19:32.160 --> 19:35.320]  about where you're going to church you're not getting a good feeling about

[24:00.400 --> 24:20.240]  we are back live coming up after I get into Obama playing the
[24:20.240 --> 24:25.160]  race card and more I'm gonna get into our top story today report more than a
[24:25.160 --> 24:31.640]  hundred thousand Americans are domestic terrorist Paul Watson is reporting
[24:31.640 --> 24:36.960]  there what the whole Homeland Security grid is really for is we the people also
[24:36.960 --> 24:40.560]  the birth of world government with Dr. Michael Kaufman key report up at info
[24:40.560 --> 24:44.680]  wars.com on that another big report the feds are openly expanding their war
[24:44.680 --> 24:48.200]  against raw milk all over the country even though they don't have jurisdiction
[24:48.200 --> 24:53.440]  they're trying to shut it down and just a lot more today that we're gonna be
[24:53.440 --> 25:00.240]  going over but I want to direct your attention first to a video we're gonna
[25:00.240 --> 25:05.440]  play here in a moment and instead of just playing the video and then analyzing
[25:05.440 --> 25:09.840]  it I'm gonna analyze it play it and then go over even more of because there's so
[25:09.840 --> 25:17.360]  many facets here but what is it that is illegal in this video is it that he's
[25:17.360 --> 25:22.920]  saying African Americans for Obama when if any other group was doing something
[25:22.920 --> 25:26.720]  like that it would be called racism and racial pandering and when the very
[25:26.720 --> 25:30.960]  Democrats that are doing this constantly lecture everyone that they can't have
[25:30.960 --> 25:35.840]  racial identity including white people and again folks you know I'm not into
[25:35.840 --> 25:40.280]  the whole race stuff I get criticized for talking about blacks having medical
[25:40.280 --> 25:43.560]  experiments done on them well facts are facts about half the time they
[25:43.560 --> 25:47.000]  declassified something that's black people being tested on the system does
[25:47.000 --> 25:53.400]  do that I mean I want everybody to do good be happy win-win I don't even
[25:53.400 --> 25:56.680]  usually get into these subjects because I understand it's a tar baby meant to get
[25:56.680 --> 26:00.920]  us all fighting with each other but this is showout race I've got to cover it
[26:00.920 --> 26:04.480]  no it's not the race pating and that's in there and I'm gonna comment on that
[26:04.480 --> 26:07.720]  it's not claiming he's the civil rights movement Martin Luther King when he
[26:07.720 --> 26:10.680]  stands against everything you think Martin Luther King would support
[26:10.680 --> 26:14.680]  secretly arresting citizens and killing them the Pentagon announced again
[26:14.680 --> 26:18.840]  yesterday they're gonna kill US citizens including in the US anytime they want no
[26:18.840 --> 26:23.160]  judge or jury I mean just outrageous I mean if Putin did that it would be all
[26:23.160 --> 26:29.280]  over the news and should be I mean this is just incredible no it's not the
[26:29.280 --> 26:33.400]  hypocritical no it's not the deception it's not all of that it's not him saying
[26:33.400 --> 26:36.720]  do your fair share and everybody's got to give more when he works for the
[26:36.720 --> 26:40.600]  mega banks of destroying us that's all the lies and hypocrisy and out of
[26:40.600 --> 26:45.640]  control deception they think they can sell because he's got you know darker
[26:45.640 --> 26:56.800]  skin I think Obama's probably as black as I am the point is is that he says have
[26:56.800 --> 27:04.720]  your vote leaders your vote squads your vote teams your election teams inside
[27:04.720 --> 27:09.440]  the churches get me elected and it's your duty basically churches to get me
[27:09.440 --> 27:15.160]  elected now you listen I want to be clear here it's not illegal to have
[27:15.160 --> 27:21.160]  churches involved politically but the federal government says it is and shuts
[27:21.160 --> 27:25.400]  churches down that do get politically involved now I can read the first
[27:25.400 --> 27:28.960]  amendment Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion
[27:28.960 --> 27:33.440]  or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or the press or the people for the
[27:33.440 --> 27:36.840]  right to assemble and redress the government I mean that's the first
[27:36.840 --> 27:42.920]  amendment go read the first amendment the first thing in the first amendment is
[27:42.920 --> 27:49.080]  Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or
[27:49.080 --> 27:54.320]  prohibiting the free exercise thereof you that means that's pretty iron tight
[27:54.320 --> 27:59.480]  for you lawyers out there and that means you can't do establishment or what
[27:59.480 --> 28:03.160]  somebody sets up and you have no jurisdiction over anything and once it's
[28:03.160 --> 28:08.740]  set up that separation church and state they've turned it around backwards and
[28:08.740 --> 28:11.360]  just through fraud I mean there's no law you got to take vaccines they're
[28:11.360 --> 28:15.000]  taking people's kids and arresting folks and the cops are dumb the juries are
[28:15.000 --> 28:19.240]  dumb the judges lie they they they they'll always send them to jail for
[28:19.240 --> 28:25.960]  something else you'll notice but they do it there is no law
[28:25.960 --> 28:33.040]  there shut down raw milk producers as long as it's not over state lines they're
[28:33.040 --> 28:35.240]  doing it
[28:36.480 --> 28:41.080]  law saying any of this there's no law you got to take vaccines they lie and
[28:41.080 --> 28:45.080]  tell you there is so you're saying well then what's illegal I mean if the
[28:45.080 --> 28:49.040]  churches are allowed to do this well not allowed you have no jurisdiction it's
[28:49.040 --> 28:52.360]  only the government gives you this right it's already there that's what our
[28:52.360 --> 28:56.800]  system of government's different government isn't the final thing we the
[28:56.800 --> 29:02.360]  people are above the government you understand that I know you understand
[29:02.360 --> 29:06.880]  that but then what's illegal what's illegal is that he is out there I see
[29:06.880 --> 29:10.760]  the news all the time they have the fed sending letters to churches reminding
[29:10.760 --> 29:15.160]  them I've seen these even lately telling Baptist churches in Austin Texas people
[29:15.160 --> 29:18.080]  brought me the letters and I've called and confirmed it Catholic churches you
[29:18.080 --> 29:24.360]  name it saying do not even discuss politics with your friends in the pews or
[29:24.360 --> 29:29.680]  at Sunday school or if you go to a church picnic you don't discuss like it's
[29:29.680 --> 29:33.720]  the Soviet Union at the church picnic who you're voting for that's what the
[29:33.720 --> 29:38.080]  feds the IRS are telling people and telling them it's the law of course not
[29:38.080 --> 29:43.120]  mentioning the law just saying it's the law and doing this while Obama's saying
[29:43.120 --> 29:47.400]  churches get out there and vote for me right now to get out there use your
[29:47.400 --> 29:50.720]  churches as campaign arms I'm gonna play you the clip of that we're gonna come back

[33:12.080 --> 33:18.440]  okay there's a lot of facets to this video and audio I'm about to play but
[33:18.440 --> 33:22.680]  you can go to the official Barack Obama website presidential campaign website
[33:22.680 --> 33:26.560]  they have their own website for this as well a separate site for the campaign
[33:26.560 --> 33:34.760]  president Obama announces the 2012 launch of African Americans for Obama and on
[33:34.760 --> 33:42.680]  the surface of that you think well okay why is Obama getting to campaign
[33:42.680 --> 33:47.880]  racially but if white people did that to be the end of the world let's just be
[33:47.880 --> 33:53.360]  honest it's natural in every culture in every society for people to tend to want
[33:53.360 --> 33:59.280]  to be part of a cultural group that's normal it's not bad to do that it's
[33:59.280 --> 34:03.880]  wrong to hate people because of whatever group it is and of course people
[34:03.880 --> 34:07.760]  from different you know human groups can love each other or whatever but the
[34:07.760 --> 34:12.480]  point is it's not dirty and bad to want to be black or want to be white or want
[34:12.480 --> 34:16.000]  to be Hispanic or want to be Asian or whatever you know if a Japanese person
[34:16.000 --> 34:19.640]  wants to marry a Japanese person that's not bad if a Jewish person wants to
[34:19.640 --> 34:25.720]  marry a Jewish person that's not bad well why is it bad if a European wants to
[34:25.720 --> 34:29.800]  marry a European this is just because the New World Order sees whites as the
[34:29.800 --> 34:34.160]  dominant group and it just simply wants to play all the other groups off against
[34:34.160 --> 34:38.600]  that not because the new order cares about those groups but because it wants
[34:38.600 --> 34:44.360]  to create a divide and conquer scenario and basically break down any group that
[34:44.360 --> 34:48.560]  is seen as dominant or cohesive the system wants to get rid of families as
[34:48.560 --> 34:52.880]  well across the board the system wants all of us to accept their phony corporate
[34:52.880 --> 34:57.160]  culture whatever culture you want to be part of whether you want to reinvent
[34:57.160 --> 35:01.120]  yourself or what or you come from the countryside and you want to be a redneck
[35:01.120 --> 35:06.200]  or whether you want to be a hip-hop person I don't care I'm into science
[35:06.200 --> 35:14.520]  literature history freedom my identity is is is the Magna Carta Constitution my
[35:14.520 --> 35:20.360]  my identification is with freedom and human potential but then when I'm
[35:20.360 --> 35:25.400]  attacked because I'm white and told you must be bad because you're white and
[35:25.400 --> 35:29.760]  I'm supposed to act all guilty and say oh yes I'm sorry well that just isn't how
[35:29.760 --> 35:35.060]  it works I've transcended all of that but I realize most people haven't because
[35:35.060 --> 35:38.960]  even if you want to transcend it other people haven't so even if you don't
[35:38.960 --> 35:42.860]  dislike them for what color they are they think you dislike them and they're
[35:42.860 --> 35:46.160]  looking for you to do something and a lot of folks take whatever you do and
[35:46.160 --> 35:50.440]  spin it around kind of like you know the driving wall black thing well that guy
[35:50.440 --> 35:55.200]  is a black guy he must be a criminal or oh you know I'm a black guy on a white
[35:55.200 --> 36:00.680]  neighborhood I must not be welcome here it's incredible few few times I've had
[36:00.680 --> 36:04.960]  Hispanic friends over you know at my house I said a few times because I have
[36:04.960 --> 36:11.040]  hardly have anybody at my house and back when I live in the city and of course I
[36:11.040 --> 36:13.880]  had neighbors that were Hispanic black you name it but they would see like three
[36:13.880 --> 36:16.960]  or four white neighbors out maybe like you think I'm welcome around here and
[36:16.960 --> 36:22.520]  I'm like you're joking right they're like no I'm not joking so it you know it
[36:22.520 --> 36:28.320]  shows how this is there and are there snobby groups everywhere yeah if I went
[36:28.320 --> 36:31.880]  to some country club here in Florida you know where there's people on average
[36:31.880 --> 36:35.240]  are probably worth ten million dollars a piece there at their country club they're
[36:35.240 --> 36:39.760]  gonna come over even if I'm wearing the perfect blazer and white shirt with the
[36:39.760 --> 36:43.120]  cuff links and everything and pull up you know in the perfect car and
[36:43.120 --> 36:46.440]  everything they're still gonna come over and ask if I'm a local or part of their
[36:46.440 --> 36:51.080]  group and they're gonna kind of act a little snooty on average not because they
[36:51.080 --> 36:54.960]  just like because I'm a white guy wearing the right suit but because that's
[36:54.960 --> 36:59.480]  part of their enjoyment that's part of the tribalism it's part of the
[36:59.480 --> 37:06.480]  satisfaction that smaller minded people get from being part of an end group and
[37:06.480 --> 37:09.680]  that happens everywhere I mean I grew up in Dallas and would walk down the street
[37:09.680 --> 37:12.680]  one of my black friends want to play basketball or baseball and they'd say
[37:12.680 --> 37:17.520]  listen honky get you know cracker get out of here and they'd be like oh just that
[37:17.520 --> 37:29.360]  old man he's racist it's just that Obama is now playing a race card with this
[37:29.360 --> 37:37.560]  and it's wrong is if people pointing out black racism against whites which is
[37:37.560 --> 37:42.080]  very bad in the nearest I mean it's gotten so bad and so acceptable that you
[37:42.080 --> 37:46.160]  seen last what five years all over the country rips of black youth beating up
[37:46.160 --> 37:49.960]  white people and it's on video it's happening everywhere does that mean
[37:49.960 --> 37:54.680]  average black folks are doing that no but young gangbangers five kids that are
[37:54.680 --> 37:59.240]  watching MTV the culture where that's cool they think it's funny and they also
[37:59.240 --> 38:03.240]  beat each other up you know and white gangs do it too they beat each other up
[38:03.240 --> 38:07.080]  they beat up other groups of people the point call it what it is when black
[38:07.080 --> 38:11.400]  gangs are racially attacking whites or Hispanics are attacking whites why is
[38:11.400 --> 38:15.280]  it always acceptable when whites get attacked why when a white guy defends
[38:15.280 --> 38:19.120]  himself on the New York subway from five guys you know it happened to be black
[38:19.120 --> 38:23.000]  is it called racist when you shoot someone they're attacking it's called
[38:23.000 --> 38:27.240]  survival and I'm against the downtrodden I'm against the innocent being
[38:27.240 --> 38:33.840]  banged up on by thugs I don't care if it's a Ku Klux Klan 150 years ago trying
[38:33.840 --> 38:38.360]  to attack blacks who they knew on firearms and laws against blacks owning
[38:38.360 --> 38:44.200]  guns I'm for everybody having freedom now with that preface said that's not
[38:44.200 --> 38:48.280]  even the issue in this new video and Paul Watson is doing an article on it
[38:48.280 --> 38:56.280]  foreign for wars.com President Obama announces the 2012 launch of African
[38:56.280 --> 39:02.240]  Americans for Obama listen to this I mean this is so this minute 42 piece is so
[39:02.240 --> 39:11.000]  mega jam packed with hypocrisy deception lies fakeness posing I mean
[39:11.000 --> 39:15.400]  everything he's saying is the opposite of what Obama really is I mean Obama is
[39:15.400 --> 39:21.640]  a horrible teleprompter reading from birth CIA creation on record who is for
[39:21.640 --> 39:25.680]  torture secret arrest endless wars constant invasions financing Al Qaeda
[39:25.680 --> 39:29.840]  invasions proxy wars destroying the Bill of Rights bankrupting our country
[39:29.840 --> 39:34.240]  shutting down our power plants boasting our power prices and the big megabanks
[39:34.240 --> 39:38.760]  that fund Mitt Romney are all funding him all you Republicans that like Mitt
[39:38.760 --> 39:42.120]  Romney that I guess the few that are out there you should love Obama because
[39:42.120 --> 39:45.600]  past the rhetoric and past the gay marriage football issues they're the
[39:45.600 --> 39:49.960]  same people look at who puts money in them I mean this is this is this is not
[39:49.960 --> 39:55.560]  2 plus 2 this is there it is is it 2 plus 2 if you see a red Volkswagen to
[39:55.560 --> 39:58.960]  say that's a red Volkswagen no it's that's a red Volkswagen that's a red
[39:58.960 --> 40:04.000]  firetruck do you have to think if you're watching me on prison planet TV wearing
[40:04.000 --> 40:10.400]  this red shirt to say that's red a reddish pink I guess salmon you could
[40:10.400 --> 40:17.640]  call it no it's not 2 plus 2 it's there it's it's red okay but but the big
[40:17.640 --> 40:24.960]  issue here the big issue the mega issue in everybody's fate
[40:24.960 --> 40:34.360]  yes listen to his exact words coming up he says in here that activate in the
[40:34.360 --> 40:38.920]  churches with your election teams I mean this is according to what they enforce
[40:38.920 --> 40:43.880]  so if it's not illegal what's illegal because they selectively enforce against
[40:43.880 --> 40:48.560]  conservative and libertarian and states rights and anti-agenda 21 churches and
[40:48.560 --> 40:55.280]  they tell people don't even talk about politics anywhere they tell the public
[40:55.280 --> 41:00.040]  to to to basically put up with having no First Amendment when they don't have
[41:00.040 --> 41:05.120]  that power but then now he's here when the government the IRS said this is
[41:05.120 --> 41:09.880]  illegal for decades here he is saying do it so it's the selective enforcement and
[41:09.880 --> 41:13.960]  the racketeering nature that they know this isn't illegal but they're telling
[41:13.960 --> 41:19.520]  you it's illegal for you but not for them this is a big issue and I've seen no
[41:19.520 --> 41:24.560]  one raise this I've seen them raise the race issue here which is secondary it
[41:24.560 --> 41:30.760]  isn't even on the radar compared to this this attack on the First Amendment
[41:30.760 --> 41:37.920]  listen to this this month we're announcing the 2012 launch of African
[41:37.920 --> 41:42.160]  Americans for Obama I don't think there's a better time than African American
[41:42.160 --> 41:46.000]  History Month to consider the tremendous progress we've made through the
[41:46.000 --> 41:50.040]  sacrifices of so many or a better time to commit to meeting the very real
[41:50.040 --> 41:54.880]  challenges we face right now every day I think of the generations of African
[41:54.880 --> 41:58.600]  American men and women who overcame slavery and oppression risked their own
[41:58.600 --> 42:03.480]  safety to cast a ballot even gave up their lives to help build a country that
[42:03.480 --> 42:08.720]  lived up to its founding principles their extraordinary hope their unwavering
[42:08.720 --> 42:13.880]  determination changed this country their efforts made it possible for somebody
[42:13.880 --> 42:18.480]  like me to be here today this is another moment we've got to decide what kind of
[42:18.480 --> 42:24.960]  cause you want it pause back it up 10 seconds I've got to stop this their
[42:24.960 --> 42:29.240]  efforts made it possible for him he says for that our campaign is a
[42:29.240 --> 42:34.880]  continuation of that you're now saying civil rights is a continuation of you
[42:34.880 --> 42:38.960]  just because you claim your part you know your dad's from Kenya don't even
[42:38.960 --> 42:44.600]  look like you whatever they did the racial actuaries he's less than 10%
[42:44.600 --> 42:48.680]  African if you believe what he's saying to you that part doesn't matter a lot of
[42:48.680 --> 42:53.440]  white people did vote for you it shows that that most whites aren't what we're
[42:53.440 --> 42:56.760]  told these people to just hate black folks out of hand yeah all the white
[42:56.760 --> 43:02.960]  folks constantly worshiping black sports figures so it's just pure bull no
[43:02.960 --> 43:05.760]  it's the minorities that have been taught it's okay to hate whitey that's
[43:05.760 --> 43:09.360]  what I see in here and it's funny and it's cute and it's corporate sponsored
[43:09.360 --> 43:15.280]  side issue did you hearing the civil rights movement his campaigns a
[43:15.280 --> 43:19.240]  continuation of the civil rights movement oh overturning habeas corpus due
[43:19.240 --> 43:23.400]  process shangles secretly arrest us and kill us and launch wars anywhere without
[43:23.400 --> 43:28.280]  congressional approval and wars in Libyan kill 30,000 plus black Africans now
[43:28.280 --> 43:31.800]  they admit and torture and murder them in a race war by the Arabs against the
[43:31.800 --> 43:36.200]  blacks all on record and you're telling us about Martin Luther King Martin Luther
[43:36.200 --> 43:42.480]  King wouldn't support you guaranteed I mean this is unbelievable I'm going to
[43:42.480 --> 43:44.800]  doc holiday here in a minute we'll keep a little bit in the next hour if we need
[43:44.800 --> 43:49.480]  to but I want to go over this video and audio continue with the rest of his
[43:49.480 --> 43:54.040]  garbage here it is possible for somebody like me to be here today this is
[43:54.040 --> 43:58.760]  another moment we've got to decide what kind of country we want to be we can
[43:58.760 --> 44:02.400]  either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really
[44:02.400 --> 44:07.640]  well or we can build a nation where everybody gets a fair shot everybody
[44:07.640 --> 44:14.320]  does their job right there and back it up to everybody does their fair share we
[44:14.320 --> 44:18.520]  can change the nation where it's fair that means socialism communism which
[44:18.520 --> 44:21.880]  all the big mega banks promote because you don't even actually get the chicken
[44:21.880 --> 44:24.760]  feed just enough to make you dependent they then transfer in the tens of
[44:24.760 --> 44:28.280]  trillions a year and austerity to them just like what's happening in Europe
[44:28.280 --> 44:32.160]  no matter what color you are where you're from where you live on the planet the
[44:32.160 --> 44:36.240]  same six mega banks are destroying your future and they want you to fight over
[44:36.240 --> 44:40.480]  race that's what Obama's doing here he's making his politics racial and then
[44:40.480 --> 44:44.400]  claiming he's fighting the man all these old ladies that were told you're
[44:44.400 --> 44:46.800]  gonna get a free house and free car they'd say I'm a good free house free
[44:46.800 --> 44:50.760]  card he goes yes you are and the media let him get away with that and then he
[44:50.760 --> 44:55.520]  didn't even get it to him because he can't but even the very women he talked
[44:55.520 --> 45:00.720]  to they didn't nobody called him on that this is this is yeah this is a total
[45:00.720 --> 45:06.680]  liar of the highest level sitting there saying he's a civil rights activist when
[45:06.680 --> 45:09.960]  he's the opposite saying saying he's gonna fight the big rich guys when he's
[45:09.960 --> 45:15.520]  totally created by them just pure lies this is 100% lies and deception but the
[45:15.520 --> 45:20.560]  big parts coming up go back to it well or we can build a nation where everybody
[45:20.560 --> 45:24.800]  gets a fair shot everybody does their fair share we can build government
[45:24.800 --> 45:28.720]  everybody plays by the stars this campaign is powered by folks that
[45:28.720 --> 45:35.200]  it was it pause again back it up I can't handle it I cannot handle it
[45:35.200 --> 45:39.960]  everybody plays by the same rules there's a fair playing field you mean
[45:39.960 --> 45:44.600]  where the big mega banks get 27 trillion dollars you mean where you exempt
[45:44.600 --> 45:48.400]  general electric from the greenhouse gas rules but not their competition and
[45:48.400 --> 45:52.520]  then let your regulators shut them down you mean where your insider buddies get
[45:52.520 --> 45:56.200]  tens of billions of dollars in green energy funding while you shut down other
[45:56.200 --> 46:02.240]  u.s. industry and then the the people you finance ship the factories to China you
[46:02.240 --> 46:07.760]  mean you mean that type of fair playing field where you demanded two years ago
[46:07.760 --> 46:10.640]  with a stimulus package that the money be given to the big banks and not for the
[46:10.640 --> 46:14.600]  people and then blame senator Dodd for it until he released the letter showing
[46:14.600 --> 46:18.040]  that you demanded that the people be screwed and robbed I mean he's such a
[46:18.040 --> 46:22.680]  liar folks he said he was against the NDAA and then signed it he wants the
[46:22.680 --> 46:26.380]  devilish cake and to eat it too all right that's enough go back to the rest of
[46:26.380 --> 46:28.920]  the clip it's just you hear the lies for yourself here's more of it
[46:28.920 --> 46:34.520]  the fair shot everybody does their fair share and everybody plays by the same
[46:34.520 --> 46:38.920]  rules this campaign is powered by folks at every level taking ownership where
[46:38.920 --> 46:45.000]  it matters most around the kitchen table in both jobs and beauty salon did pause
[46:45.000 --> 46:49.960]  back it up again I just cannot handle it right now did you catch that
[46:49.960 --> 46:56.560]  everybody pays their fair share everybody works his heart everybody
[46:56.560 --> 47:00.320]  really everybody's by the same rules like the illegal aliens who are above the
[47:00.320 --> 47:04.680]  law and get to have drunk driver Rex and not get arrested or $10 fines and you
[47:04.680 --> 47:07.640]  accept fake consulate matriculate cards the Mexican government issues to
[47:07.640 --> 47:11.720]  anybody five ten apiece because they know they're getting welfare on it sending
[47:11.720 --> 47:15.560]  it back to Mexico you mean all that selective enforcement you mean how you
[47:15.560 --> 47:20.080]  ship guns to Mexico you mean how the ice has been caught being ordered to
[47:20.080 --> 47:22.880]  legalize the illegal aliens and to release violent felons when they get
[47:22.880 --> 47:26.440]  released from prison to not deport them but you throw the book it set us as
[47:26.440 --> 47:31.800]  because we're seen as dumb schmucks continue back to Obama really well or we
[47:31.800 --> 47:36.280]  can build a nation where everybody gets a fair shot everybody does their fair
[47:36.280 --> 47:41.560]  share and everybody plays by the same rules this campaign is powered by folks
[47:41.560 --> 47:45.960]  at every level taking ownership where it matters most around the kitchen table
[47:45.960 --> 47:51.840]  in barber shops and beauty salons in your faith community at work or at school
[47:51.840 --> 47:55.760]  and of course in the voting booth this election day because we are greater

[48:36.280 --> 48:40.840]  over Orlando since Obama came to town they've been airing these ads on TV
[48:40.840 --> 48:47.320]  about how you know it's about us us we we we're black you're white and here it
[48:47.320 --> 48:53.560]  is cops till at Florida mall after riot last night over new nights and this is
[48:53.560 --> 48:57.880]  the type of stuff this is news 15 reporting on this we're about to go to
[48:57.880 --> 49:00.960]  break we'll have him for two segments I appreciate him sitting there while I went
[49:00.960 --> 49:04.280]  over all of this but Doc holidays on the radio on 8 10 a.m. right before I am on
[49:04.280 --> 49:09.640]  every day and I'm gonna traveling there tomorrow to then speak Sunday but but
[49:09.640 --> 49:13.480]  this is the type of garbage we're seeing and it's going on tell us when we come
[49:13.480 --> 49:18.160]  back from break what you're gonna be breaking down here the bottom line is
[49:18.160 --> 49:22.400]  that you know first off that announcement from Obama that's about as
[49:22.400 --> 49:28.080]  criminally racial racially as you possibly get it but it's divided the community
[49:28.080 --> 49:32.840]  we have the NBA all-star game here and the NBA all-star game of course is an
[49:32.840 --> 49:37.800]  ethnic event but Obama planned his trip around that and suddenly that is being
[49:37.800 --> 49:42.480]  run as a PSA on various radio stations on TV stations they're running the video
[49:42.480 --> 49:48.040]  and it's really upset some people it's also charged a lot of people up on a
[49:48.040 --> 49:53.120]  different level you know bringing up slavery again invoking the image of
[49:53.120 --> 49:56.920]  Martin Luther King we don't need to go back to slavery for God's sakes the
[49:56.920 --> 50:00.840]  great divider has taken us back in time and so people were getting wrapped up
[50:00.840 --> 50:04.600]  the all-star game is here for us they built a big fence about around the
[50:04.600 --> 50:09.680]  Amway arena so we possibly couldn't see all the big rappers and everything that
[50:09.680 --> 50:13.960]  was going on in town and the local businesses are being put aside and there
[50:13.960 --> 50:19.280]  was a riot last night because a whole bunch of young ethnic teens that's all
[50:19.280 --> 50:24.560]  I'm gonna say showed up on a a whim that some apparently glow-in-the-dark shoes
[50:24.560 --> 50:28.400]  were available and these were Obama's people and they started a huge huge
[50:28.400 --> 50:31.960]  fight and the cops had to be pulled in and of course the liberal media you know
[50:31.960 --> 50:36.120]  what they do the liberal media only shows the the white cop with the shaved
[50:36.120 --> 50:40.720]  head chasing down a poor little ethnic fella on a horse and it was betrayed
[50:40.720 --> 50:45.520]  totally betrayed totally wrong and Obama that's what you're done this is part of
[50:45.520 --> 50:50.560]  this problem reaction solutions synthesis where they make it about race

[54:09.600 --> 54:18.200]  your mind I want to be clear it's illegal that Obama is telling conservative
[54:18.200 --> 54:21.520]  libertarian churches don't even discuss politics in the pews I mean that is
[54:21.520 --> 54:26.040]  wild when there's no jurisdiction but then he's saying I need election
[54:26.040 --> 54:30.400]  captains in all the churches voting for me and it does start to violate church
[54:30.400 --> 54:35.360]  and state when the president himself is going and getting involved I mean it may
[54:35.360 --> 54:39.200]  even cross that line you don't want a state religion that's what the First
[54:39.200 --> 54:42.320]  Amendment is against and the state religion under this new world order is
[54:42.320 --> 54:46.440]  worship of government and corruption but I mean that is hiding in plain view is
[54:46.440 --> 54:50.440]  so big after Doc Holiday leaves us we've got a guest coming on it ties into
[54:50.440 --> 54:54.440]  this report more than 100,000 Americans are domestic terrorists they're now
[54:54.440 --> 54:59.320]  saying the Tea Party movement and sovereign citizen anti-agenda 21
[54:59.320 --> 55:03.440]  movement are a bigger threat than Islamic terrorists I told you for a long
[55:03.440 --> 55:07.080]  time you know the white Al Qaeda ads they're running were all the terrorists
[55:07.080 --> 55:11.720]  are white everybody reporting them as a minority that this is going to be really
[55:11.720 --> 55:15.760]  bad I mean if you're a white person folks you got a crosshair on you because
[55:15.760 --> 55:20.160]  you're seen on average as middle-class with some money you want your second
[55:20.160 --> 55:24.560]  amendment you're going to be a problem you understand that so we're gonna be
[55:24.560 --> 55:27.400]  breaking that down a doc holiday only got you about three four minutes in this
[55:27.400 --> 55:31.080]  segment a little next segment but I mean break down why you're saying that you
[55:31.080 --> 55:36.240]  can feel the the division there in the city since these ads are running we know
[55:36.240 --> 55:39.680]  about some of the fights the riots the police being called out I mean what
[55:39.680 --> 55:43.800]  else are you talking about here I mean describe why you're saying that you can
[55:43.800 --> 55:47.760]  suddenly you know in Orlando it's a very diverse city and has a large black
[55:47.760 --> 55:52.640]  population why you're saying you really feel division now I think the ads once
[55:52.640 --> 55:57.720]  they started to run and bring up the images of a slavery and have him you
[55:57.720 --> 56:03.040]  know depicting himself as the great leader of the new civil rights movement
[56:03.040 --> 56:07.680]  have what they've done is and raise the tension you hear it in people's comments
[56:07.680 --> 56:12.200]  you see it on the news when people are talking about rock just happening to come
[56:12.200 --> 56:18.520]  during all-star weekend having a $30,000 a plate dinner events Vince Carter's
[56:18.520 --> 56:22.120]  house used to be a former magic player and of course the elite the NBA players
[56:22.120 --> 56:26.240]  were there and it became a source of this is all happening now of course we
[56:26.240 --> 56:32.480]  have a Daytona 500 over in Daytona and it became a it became a division and the
[56:32.480 --> 56:36.760]  more these ran the more people said yeah slavery yeah Martin Luther King and it
[56:36.760 --> 56:41.320]  became the NBA all-star game which is an ethnic event okay we'll give it that the
[56:41.320 --> 56:45.160]  majority of players in the NBA or african-american we understand that but
[56:45.160 --> 56:49.400]  they built but it's but they don't want it to be the bankers that Obama works
[56:49.400 --> 56:52.840]  for making us all slaves they don't want to make it all the illegal wars they
[56:52.840 --> 56:57.520]  always want to bring up race and slavery to reinvoke it to create the
[56:57.520 --> 57:01.800]  division these are the limousine liberal poverty pimps who are selling race
[57:01.800 --> 57:15.240]  they're the ones actually making people get at each other's throats and not
[57:15.240 --> 57:19.200]  holiday yeah right here I lost there for a second you're absolutely right about
[57:19.200 --> 57:23.280]  that what it is is that the news was going hey you know Barack Obama's coming
[57:23.280 --> 57:26.680]  down and he's gonna be at Vince Carter's house and it's the all-star game and
[57:26.680 --> 57:30.160]  it's black history month and it was getting tossed and tossed and tossed and
[57:30.160 --> 57:33.640]  of course the slavery was coming around and they would put younger people that
[57:33.640 --> 57:37.840]  are easily misled on TV and they were like yeah you know he's here to stop
[57:37.840 --> 57:41.600]  the slavery he's here to stop this he's here to celebrate this is our town now
[57:41.600 --> 57:45.600]  we've got Orlando and of course Daytona they've got all the rednecks and the
[57:45.600 --> 57:49.360]  races I've never met a presidential incumbent or candidate who would turn
[57:49.360 --> 57:54.800]  down a chance to get in front of 150,000 people at a race but he made he made
[57:54.800 --> 57:59.760]  simply by a vibration that was coming over the news and then last night the
[57:59.760 --> 58:03.920]  ride at the Florida mall which you know we're Obama's folks and they were to get
[58:03.920 --> 58:07.240]  I guess there were 10 pair of sneakers that were supposed to be on display with
[58:07.240 --> 58:09.960]  NPA well I tell you what we're about to go to break I want to hear more about
[58:09.960 --> 58:13.520]  sure sure I want to hear more about what happened at the Orlando mall we come
[58:13.520 --> 58:17.840]  back in a moment but undoubtedly Obama himself you know in private discussions
[58:17.840 --> 58:21.840]  has been recorded saying you got these you know white bitter rural bitter
[58:21.840 --> 58:25.480]  clingers they want their Bibles they want their guns and that's why they were
[58:25.480 --> 58:28.800]  black in bitter clingers the system would hate them they want their Bibles
[58:28.800 --> 58:33.080]  they want their guns they won't bind our new world order fake culture of the end
[58:33.080 --> 58:35.960]  of the family and the disease of globalism they're the bad guys so I
[58:35.960 --> 58:39.440]  agree with you that's what this is all about they're running these ads where
[58:39.440 --> 58:49.080]  Obama is the black Moses this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network
[58:50.080 --> 58:55.600]  a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had
[58:55.600 --> 58:59.400]  a pretty good size meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a
[58:59.400 --> 59:03.480]  well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[59:03.480 --> 59:06.880]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[59:06.880 --> 59:11.680]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our
[59:11.680 --> 59:16.160]  bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I've in

[1:01:04.120 --> 1:01:10.880]  invoking racial division and now the the manifestation of it by the globalist
[1:01:10.880 --> 1:01:15.920]  puppet Barack Obama and then what happened last night at the shopping mall
[1:01:15.920 --> 1:01:20.000]  we see this now on almost a weekly basis the riots at shopping malls over
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:26.200]  tennis use the riots at walmart's over Xboxes just you see it across the board
[1:01:26.200 --> 1:01:30.160]  groups of people stumbling over each other to get a discount really the
[1:01:30.160 --> 1:01:33.880]  disintegration of society doc holiday talk show host witnessing this in

[1:01:37.720 --> 1:01:41.480]  witnessed okay I'm sorry that you couldn't hear me but here's what's
[1:01:41.480 --> 1:01:49.400]  going on the media was pumping up this racial division with Obama's what we
[1:01:49.400 --> 1:01:54.400]  call a public service announcement it's not really a commercial so to speak they
[1:01:54.400 --> 1:01:58.560]  got play on all the TV stations and of course the NBA all-star game is here and
[1:01:58.560 --> 1:02:04.520]  they built a gigantic wall around the Amway Center the Amway Arena so the
[1:02:04.520 --> 1:02:10.520]  local businesses would not be patronized during the all-star game many of the
[1:02:10.520 --> 1:02:16.120]  businesses of course happen to be white on the other side where it's a it's more
[1:02:16.120 --> 1:02:20.360]  of an urban area they can come and go as they please they also built specific
[1:02:20.360 --> 1:02:24.880]  roads for Obama's VIP people but they wouldn't have to be bothered with the
[1:02:24.880 --> 1:02:29.680]  great unwashed and once again over and over and over again this that chest
[1:02:29.680 --> 1:02:33.960]  pumping was going on this is our town the president's coming to our town we
[1:02:33.960 --> 1:02:37.400]  own this town this time and people are just getting they were getting tense
[1:02:37.400 --> 1:02:41.120]  people were getting tense I'm not surprised we had a big riot that the
[1:02:41.120 --> 1:02:44.960]  local Florida ball last night over a pair of silly tennis shoes because the
[1:02:44.960 --> 1:02:48.560]  sense of entitlement that came out of that announcement and then having him
[1:02:48.560 --> 1:02:54.040]  here over at Vince Carter former NBA player for the Magic and NBA you know
[1:02:54.040 --> 1:02:59.840]  superstars and the elitist and all the pop stars they're here and pop stars
[1:02:59.840 --> 1:03:04.080]  that have committed assault and battery on on women and but they're hooked up
[1:03:04.080 --> 1:03:08.440]  upon is like well we have to put a wall up because we are the elite Brock came
[1:03:08.440 --> 1:03:13.360]  in made it worse he just made it worse it simply got to a point where
[1:03:13.360 --> 1:03:17.280]  everybody was feeling this black versus white thing I hate to say it you know and
[1:03:17.280 --> 1:03:21.120]  I've been yelling for a week I've been playing that the Obama announcement for
[1:03:21.120 --> 1:03:25.000]  a week saying listen to this they're bringing up slavery why do we have to
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:29.560]  go there and then they put the young kids on TV the one with the gold tee they
[1:03:29.560 --> 1:03:32.960]  got the gold grill God bless him I don't know if they think that's attractive or
[1:03:32.960 --> 1:03:36.880]  not talk about my president's gonna be here yeah I've seen that announcement
[1:03:36.880 --> 1:03:41.120]  on TV they enslaved us this is our weekend well we're not gonna be able to
[1:03:41.120 --> 1:03:45.320]  win this way he's become the great divider and yes we have racial tensions
[1:03:45.320 --> 1:03:49.240]  right here in the city of Orlando and last night the Florida mall one of the

[1:08:20.160 --> 1:08:33.040]  Alex Jones all right we have a thought crime criminal David Sardy who just
[1:08:33.040 --> 1:08:37.440]  popped in for one segment last Sunday on the fact that he had his second
[1:08:37.440 --> 1:08:43.240]  amendment outside of court extra judicially taken from him because he went
[1:08:43.240 --> 1:08:46.320]  in to the doctor's office over chest pains and they wanted to do a lot of
[1:08:46.320 --> 1:08:50.920]  surgery and he didn't want to do it now he's fine you know months later and now
[1:08:50.920 --> 1:08:52.920]  he doesn't have a second amendment they said well the fact that you don't want
[1:08:52.920 --> 1:08:57.000]  to have our our tubes stuck in your chest to see what's going on shows your
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:09:02.840]  suicidal because not doing our procedure means you want to die and he is like no

[1:09:10.560 --> 1:09:16.680]  jail no judge no jury medical tyranny we saw it in Nazi Germany sought big time
[1:09:16.680 --> 1:09:20.600]  the Soviet Union and her mouth that's coming up in a moment I'm gonna tie
[1:09:20.600 --> 1:09:23.760]  that in with some of the other big gun grabs going on and then in studio I'm
[1:09:23.760 --> 1:09:27.320]  not in studio but in our Austin studios because everybody's moving to Central
[1:09:27.320 --> 1:09:31.360]  Texas I mean the entire Patriot Liberty movement seems to be moving there and
[1:09:31.360 --> 1:09:36.040]  that's great that's great because I'm a recluse that just hangs out the in full
[1:09:36.040 --> 1:09:40.200]  Wars Command Center and I love all the great people moving to town because
[1:09:40.200 --> 1:09:44.400]  Austin's beautiful and full of great people but since he lives outside Austin
[1:09:44.400 --> 1:09:48.760]  he's gonna be in studio Sheriff Mack suing the Southern Barbery Law Center
[1:09:48.760 --> 1:09:54.720]  for defaming him boy did they and also he just had over a hundred sheriff show
[1:09:54.720 --> 1:09:58.520]  up at his event and the Denver Post and others have demonized it imagine a
[1:09:58.520 --> 1:10:01.440]  former sheriff who went to the Supreme Court and one of landmark Second
[1:10:01.440 --> 1:10:05.640]  Amendment States rights case and he's get sheriff's together saying hey we need
[1:10:05.640 --> 1:10:09.480]  to defend local jurisdiction and get back at the Constitution and the
[1:10:09.480 --> 1:10:12.960]  control corporate trader media the occupational government media the
[1:10:12.960 --> 1:10:17.920]  occupational government propaganda ministry of lies is freaking out pulling
[1:10:17.920 --> 1:10:20.680]  their hair out they're scared of oath keepers they're scared of the sheriff's
[1:10:20.680 --> 1:10:25.560]  groups their share they are scared of us getting together and coming out and
[1:10:25.560 --> 1:10:30.200]  reclaiming America as the real Americans go and listen traders listen foreign
[1:10:30.200 --> 1:10:33.680]  operatives you're not going to call us terrorists anymore you're the terrorist
[1:10:33.680 --> 1:10:37.920]  you're the people putting on Kyde in charge of Libyan on record you're the
[1:10:37.920 --> 1:10:41.360]  people opening up our borders you're the people selling out our sovereignty
[1:10:41.360 --> 1:10:47.040]  you're the people shipping guns into Mexico you're the criminals and no
[1:10:47.040 --> 1:10:50.920]  matter what color you are what religion you are under attack by these global
[1:10:50.920 --> 1:10:53.760]  banks and they will try to get us fighting with each other all day and
[1:10:53.760 --> 1:10:57.040]  that's the next point I want to get to and we're going to our guest this
[1:10:57.040 --> 1:11:01.760]  minute 40 ad that is looks like it's shot in the Oval Office with the American
[1:11:01.760 --> 1:11:06.440]  flag behind him and it's president Obama like it's a black history month
[1:11:06.440 --> 1:11:09.200]  announcement it's so it's not done like a political land I've never seen a
[1:11:09.200 --> 1:11:12.680]  president do something like this and the whole thing is basically he's Martin
[1:11:12.680 --> 1:11:17.920]  Luther King he's gonna stop slavery you know reinvoking racism reinvoking old
[1:11:17.920 --> 1:11:26.160]  wounds reinvoking division he's gonna bring a fair playing field working for
[1:11:26.160 --> 1:11:29.640]  the big mega banks and of course he's Martin Luther King even though he's for
[1:11:29.640 --> 1:11:34.200]  secret arrest secret torture and the opposite in the AA but that he wants the
[1:11:34.200 --> 1:11:40.280]  churches and the and the and the church captains at the churches to organize
[1:11:40.280 --> 1:11:46.840]  everyone to vote for him I mean it's it's incredible and it's being aired as a
[1:11:46.840 --> 1:11:52.680]  PSA and I've confirmed I was talking to our guest talk show host doc holiday
[1:11:52.680 --> 1:11:59.200]  from the big 810 there in Orlando one of our affiliates and he was pointing out
[1:11:59.200 --> 1:12:03.800]  this is running as a commercial and I found it on the White House website
[1:12:03.800 --> 1:12:09.880]  other areas but then I confirmed this is being aired on TV in select markets
[1:12:09.880 --> 1:12:14.880]  when Obama comes to town like a presidential announcement like they're
[1:12:14.880 --> 1:12:21.680]  attacking Baghdad or something just a new level of criminality being able to
[1:12:21.680 --> 1:12:27.640]  have campaign ads run as PSAs when you're supposed to pay for those this is
[1:12:27.640 --> 1:12:31.800]  unprecedented and it's hiding in plain view I've got to play this one more time
[1:12:31.800 --> 1:12:38.080]  because it's so outrageous can you catch all the points reinvoking race
[1:12:38.080 --> 1:12:44.360]  acting like he's a civil rights activist saying he's gonna give you a fair
[1:12:44.360 --> 1:12:51.120]  playing field when they do the opposite giving it a special interest and we need
[1:12:51.120 --> 1:12:55.200]  to use the churches politically to get Obama elected here it is this month we're
[1:12:55.200 --> 1:13:00.080]  announcing the 2012 launch of African Americans for Obama I don't think there's
[1:13:00.080 --> 1:13:03.720]  a better time than African American History Month to consider the
[1:13:03.720 --> 1:13:08.240]  tremendous progress we've made through the sacrifices of so many or a better
[1:13:08.240 --> 1:13:12.960]  time to commit to meeting the very real challenges we face right now every day I
[1:13:12.960 --> 1:13:16.440]  think of the generations of African American men and women who overcame
[1:13:16.440 --> 1:13:21.680]  slavery and oppression risked their own safety to cast a ballot even gave up
[1:13:21.680 --> 1:13:25.160]  their lives to help build a country that lived up to its founding principles
[1:13:25.160 --> 1:13:30.640]  their extraordinary hope their unwavering determination changed this
[1:13:30.640 --> 1:13:35.480]  country their efforts made it possible for somebody like me to be here today
[1:13:35.480 --> 1:13:39.400]  this is another moment when we've got to decide what kind of country we want to
[1:13:39.400 --> 1:13:44.280]  be we can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do
[1:13:44.280 --> 1:13:48.800]  really well or we can build a nation where everybody gets a fair shot
[1:13:48.800 --> 1:13:54.320]  everybody does their fair share and everybody plays by the same rules this
[1:13:54.320 --> 1:13:58.160]  campaign is powered by folks at every level taking ownership where it matters
[1:13:58.160 --> 1:14:03.080]  most around the kitchen table in barber shops and beauty salons in your faith
[1:14:03.080 --> 1:14:08.400]  community at work or at school and of course in the voting booth this election
[1:14:08.400 --> 1:14:12.880]  day because we are greater together than we can ever be on our own visit
[1:14:12.880 --> 1:14:18.560]  AfricanAmericans.VoracObama.com for more information about all the ways you can
[1:14:18.560 --> 1:14:23.440]  get involved from attending HBCU organizing workshops to becoming a

[1:14:30.160 --> 1:14:38.920]  you out there. Thanks I mean this guy reintroduced the funding that Republicans
[1:14:38.920 --> 1:14:42.800]  have gotten blocked something good they did to finance basically forced abortions

[1:14:47.480 --> 1:14:53.400]  us abort that baby and again you say well there are too many black people
[1:14:53.400 --> 1:14:56.560]  I've actually had liberal black people say well there are too many black people
[1:14:56.560 --> 1:15:01.520]  okay so it's okay to kill black people but I'm bad cuz I'm white but he can do
[1:15:01.520 --> 1:15:05.240]  whatever he wants because he's supposedly black I mean it's it's it's it's like
[1:15:05.240 --> 1:15:12.320]  that Hollywood actor what's his name he's in pulp fiction and he's in the new
[1:15:12.320 --> 1:15:16.520]  Star Wars movies I mean he's a good actor Samuel Jackson came out a few weeks ago
[1:15:16.520 --> 1:15:20.640]  and said I voted for him because he's black and I'll do it again I don't care
[1:15:20.640 --> 1:15:25.320]  he's black so I mean can somebody kill you because they're black I mean could

[1:18:27.920 --> 1:18:33.560]  up I went to a cardiologist because he had not given me my test results for
[1:18:33.560 --> 1:18:38.440]  over a month so I made an appointment went to him he said nothing wrong with
[1:18:38.440 --> 1:18:44.600]  my heart I described the attack I was having as you know I couldn't I felt
[1:18:44.600 --> 1:18:49.120]  like I was suffocating and said that was the closest I had ever felt like
[1:18:49.120 --> 1:18:54.040]  committing suicide and he said was I gonna commit suicide I told him plainly
[1:18:54.040 --> 1:18:58.480]  no I'm not gonna commit suicide I'm not suffocating I mean it was it was a
[1:18:58.480 --> 1:19:03.520]  suffocating thing couldn't couldn't breathe and he started saying well
[1:19:03.520 --> 1:19:06.960]  there's all these things we can do we can do tricks or stick tubes in you I
[1:19:06.960 --> 1:19:10.960]  says no I don't want to live like that he said well that sounds suicidal I
[1:19:10.960 --> 1:19:14.680]  says well I'm not so you know I'm not gonna commit suicide you know it's
[1:19:14.680 --> 1:19:20.200]  against my religion of course he ignored that and then I went on and it got into
[1:19:20.200 --> 1:19:24.200]  like you know he'd asked me how would you do it you know I said well there's a
[1:19:24.200 --> 1:19:29.560]  thousand in one ways I could do it if I wanted to but you know that they ignored
[1:19:29.560 --> 1:19:34.080]  if you wanted to sounds like he was watching the top TV show you're on

[1:24:23.520 --> 1:24:27.000]  private property in the Second Amendment because what's happening at
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:30.280]  David Sartie's happening to hundreds of thousands of veterans with no criminal
[1:24:30.280 --> 1:24:33.680]  record they try to go buy a gun and are told they're mentally ill it's happening
[1:24:33.680 --> 1:24:36.920]  to people that are told oh you're in a car wreck are you depressed and they go
[1:24:36.920 --> 1:24:39.480]  to the daughter and say I'm kind of depressed about broken ribs or whatever
[1:24:39.480 --> 1:24:43.320]  and oh well that's it you're now depressed and suicidal no Second Amendment
[1:24:43.320 --> 1:24:48.320]  ever again no judge no jury there's not even a law they just do it and it's all
[1:24:48.320 --> 1:24:52.440]  about extra judicially taking your Second Amendment away we're gonna have
[1:24:52.440 --> 1:24:56.160]  Sheriff Mack in studio later so we'll bring that question up to him as well
[1:24:56.160 --> 1:24:59.720]  but here's a report that dovetails with it I'll cover later in our interview
[1:24:59.720 --> 1:25:03.600]  report more than a hundred thousand Americans are domestic terror threats
[1:25:03.600 --> 1:25:07.640]  even the LA Times is saying that the new threat is people like David Sartie they
[1:25:07.640 --> 1:25:11.520]  say basically anybody that wants to be independent okay David get back to your
[1:25:11.520 --> 1:25:15.400]  story so you're explaining no I don't mean that literally it's a figure of
[1:25:15.400 --> 1:25:20.720]  speech I'm saying it was like I'm dying it was horrible what did he say next
[1:25:20.720 --> 1:25:25.640]  well he said that he I needed to go to the emergency room to speak to another
[1:25:25.640 --> 1:25:31.120]  doctor and at that time I told him look I can't afford going to emergency rooms
[1:25:31.120 --> 1:25:35.960]  and besides I live on a farm I've got animals to take care of I've got four
[1:25:35.960 --> 1:25:39.840]  little dogs that are in the house you know I you know I've got to go let them
[1:25:39.840 --> 1:25:45.080]  out they didn't want they didn't he didn't care about none of that so anyway
[1:25:45.080 --> 1:25:51.240]  he told me to wait in the hallway and I heard the nurse you know calling the
[1:25:51.240 --> 1:25:55.640]  sheriff's office so I said well it's I got to get out of here so I left and I
[1:25:55.640 --> 1:26:02.120]  went straight home and no sooner than I got back to the house like it's like you
[1:26:02.120 --> 1:26:06.960]  know I got on my four-wheeler and I was fixing to go do feeding and the sheriff's
[1:26:06.960 --> 1:26:17.760]  office shows up and well anyway they basically said I had to go they said
[1:26:17.760 --> 1:26:23.880]  there I had no choice in the matter I had to go and anyway the one lieutenant
[1:26:23.880 --> 1:26:28.640]  deputy he said that if I went you know he would wait around and give me a ride
[1:26:28.640 --> 1:26:35.280]  back home after they evaluated me I said okay let's get this over with so I went
[1:26:35.280 --> 1:26:40.400]  down there and set in the emergency room for an hour goes by they draw blood they
[1:26:40.400 --> 1:26:45.200]  take blood pressures all that stuff make me sign an agreement saying it look I'm
[1:26:45.200 --> 1:26:50.520]  not gonna commit suicide you know had to write it out and you know the second
[1:26:50.520 --> 1:26:53.920]  hour goes by and finally I you know I says they're not letting me out of here
[1:26:53.920 --> 1:26:57.920]  you know I try just quit cooperating I said no more blood pressures no more
[1:26:57.920 --> 1:27:02.120]  nothing you know you're you're you're lying to me you're keeping me a prisoner
[1:27:02.120 --> 1:27:06.840]  here I'm not gonna cooperate I want an attorney that's when the doctor the
[1:27:06.840 --> 1:27:10.880]  female doctor at the hospital through that she threw down her pen and said
[1:27:10.880 --> 1:27:17.720]  I've had enough of you and she had me committed to the mental institution
[1:27:17.720 --> 1:27:23.720]  which is a McFarland hospital in Lebanon Tennessee so I went you know the
[1:27:23.720 --> 1:27:28.400]  sheriff had to come back takes me to the mental thing for observation they say
[1:27:28.400 --> 1:27:32.120]  it's for you know observation well I get there and basically I'm not
[1:27:32.120 --> 1:27:36.440]  cooperating I'm every piece of paper you know even for my stuff I had to take
[1:27:36.440 --> 1:27:41.320]  out of my pockets I would put on there under duress I'm you know I'm signing
[1:27:41.320 --> 1:27:45.800]  everything every piece of paper with my name on it says you know I'm being held
[1:27:45.800 --> 1:27:54.240]  against my will and so anyhow that day I spent two days there before they even
[1:27:54.240 --> 1:27:59.040]  let me speak to an attorney it was 24 hours before I even spoke to the the
[1:27:59.040 --> 1:28:04.640]  the psychiatrist and it was another 24 hours before I even got to speak to the
[1:28:04.640 --> 1:28:08.080]  attorney and he told me basically what I was doing you know just shut up and
[1:28:08.080 --> 1:28:13.440]  don't talk to him when the judge came in the Friday which was two days after
[1:28:13.440 --> 1:28:19.240]  that they you know the judge cut me loose said there was no reason for me to be
[1:28:19.240 --> 1:28:24.280]  there and now correct me if I'm wrong but but you're a veteran with no
[1:28:24.280 --> 1:28:27.720]  criminal record right why do you think they were doing this to you was it
[1:28:27.720 --> 1:28:31.880]  jealousy because you're on a big TV show or or what was this just standard
[1:28:31.880 --> 1:28:36.200]  operating procedure well I have a hunch it was because they found out I had
[1:28:36.200 --> 1:28:41.080]  insurance and they wanted you know most of the people in there didn't get
[1:28:41.080 --> 1:28:46.960]  any get no money from so it was it was that and I don't I don't really know
[1:28:46.960 --> 1:28:53.840]  because this happened before the doomsday prepper ad aired now I do know
[1:28:53.840 --> 1:28:59.640]  that PETA had called the sheriff's office on me or the ASPCA had called them on me
[1:28:59.640 --> 1:29:05.280]  for doing live shows like you do except I was dehorning and tattooing goats and
[1:29:05.280 --> 1:29:09.960]  showing how farm life is well they considered that one one call they called
[1:29:09.960 --> 1:29:15.200]  on me was for goat choking and then the following week they called the called
[1:29:15.200 --> 1:29:19.640]  the cops out here now this is the Ohio ASPCA they called Tennessee to my
[1:29:19.640 --> 1:29:23.400]  sheriff's office yes so they're saying in regular farm work that everybody does
[1:29:23.400 --> 1:29:28.200]  that's just standard procedure they're trying to imply that's illegal yeah well
[1:29:28.200 --> 1:29:33.360]  they said it was abuse to animals but I did get something in case any of the
[1:29:33.360 --> 1:29:39.640]  ASPCA people are watching right now I I've got something here from Tennessee
[1:29:39.640 --> 1:29:45.000]  it's called a dead animal I'm gonna wear on my head in honor of them oh you're
[1:29:45.000 --> 1:29:50.040]  talking about a coon skin cap yeah the last honor evil sir no no sir they're

[1:31:01.040 --> 1:31:05.760]  over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty
[1:31:05.760 --> 1:31:09.280]  good-sized meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a
[1:31:09.280 --> 1:31:13.400]  well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[1:31:13.400 --> 1:31:16.920]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[1:31:16.920 --> 1:31:21.600]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our
[1:31:21.600 --> 1:31:26.080]  bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I then

[1:32:07.200 --> 1:32:10.680]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more

[1:32:53.680 --> 1:32:58.320]  crisis non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item this is Alex Jones for
[1:32:58.320 --> 1:33:01.680]  survivalseedbank.com
[1:33:13.120 --> 1:33:21.760]  there's a war going on right now the six big megabanks owned by a handful of
[1:33:21.760 --> 1:33:25.360]  families have built a private global corporate government they're now
[1:33:25.360 --> 1:33:31.840]  announcing the expansion of that private bank of the world consortium as it
[1:33:31.840 --> 1:33:36.960]  created the global currency crisis sold tens upon tens of trillions of
[1:33:36.960 --> 1:33:41.520]  dollars even small nations in fraudulent garbage and are now holding those
[1:33:41.520 --> 1:33:45.440]  countries hostage instead of all going to jail like burning made off for
[1:33:45.440 --> 1:33:49.920]  Kinley they are now posing as our saviors with the corporate media that
[1:33:49.920 --> 1:33:53.440]  they own telling us that they're the good guys
[1:33:53.440 --> 1:33:58.000]  they are simultaneously financing the police the military
[1:33:58.000 --> 1:34:02.960]  and others training that anyone that talks about a new world order is insane
[1:34:02.960 --> 1:34:06.480]  anybody that talks about international banker takeovers is insane
[1:34:06.480 --> 1:34:09.600]  it doesn't exist
[1:34:11.440 --> 1:34:15.040]  as they publicly announce it and set it up they think the cops are dumb and they
[1:34:15.040 --> 1:34:18.160]  say this doesn't exist okay these these people that talk about a new world
[1:34:18.160 --> 1:34:21.040]  order and how we're going to have troops on the streets and how we're going to be
[1:34:21.040 --> 1:34:24.400]  arresting people they're crazy that was the propaganda five years ago now it's
[1:34:24.400 --> 1:34:27.920]  all starting and they're like anyone who doesn't want the military to secretly
[1:34:27.920 --> 1:34:32.400]  arrest people and have torture and no bill of rights is the bad guys
[1:34:32.400 --> 1:34:36.480]  remember all the stuff we got demonized for go read an adl they're seven and
[1:34:36.480 --> 1:34:38.880]  probably lost in a report from 10 years ago
[1:34:38.880 --> 1:34:43.680]  15 years ago 20 years ago it reads like today's newspaper
[1:34:43.680 --> 1:34:49.200]  everything that they were demonizing people for warning of has now come to pass
[1:34:49.200 --> 1:34:53.840]  so now we're not bad for being against world government
[1:34:55.120 --> 1:34:59.520]  we're bad because we don't accept the world government
[1:34:59.520 --> 1:35:04.400]  and to be specific before we were bad because new order didn't exist
[1:35:04.400 --> 1:35:08.320]  now we're bad because we don't like the world government
[1:35:08.320 --> 1:35:11.840]  but then they still have the old propaganda of ha ha ha doesn't exist
[1:35:11.840 --> 1:35:15.920]  but you're bad because you don't like it as the un three weeks ago announced
[1:35:15.920 --> 1:35:19.680]  world government world taxes yet again as a solution to
[1:35:19.680 --> 1:35:26.240]  all of our problems so that is just some of the information
[1:35:26.240 --> 1:35:30.720]  that we're breaking down here and there's a fight going on the fight that i
[1:35:30.720 --> 1:35:34.320]  mentioned as we came in from the break and that fight is
[1:35:34.320 --> 1:35:39.040]  between the forces of free humanity and the globalist and the globalists
[1:35:39.040 --> 1:35:41.760]  through their media systems through their training systems
[1:35:41.760 --> 1:35:46.160]  are teaching them bureaucracy that real americans are the bad guys that real
[1:35:46.160 --> 1:35:49.600]  americans are the problem that real americans
[1:35:49.600 --> 1:35:53.040]  are violent and are going to have to be dealt with and in a way that's going to
[1:35:53.040 --> 1:35:56.960]  become a self-fulfilling prophecy as the system wages war against the people
[1:35:56.960 --> 1:36:00.160]  more and more of the population of this country are going to stand up and take
[1:36:00.160 --> 1:36:02.400]  action and as we go back to our guest i wanted to
[1:36:02.400 --> 1:36:07.120]  read this to him as he finishes up you know basically what's happened to him
[1:36:07.120 --> 1:36:11.360]  report more than a hundred thousand americans are domestic terrorist
[1:36:11.360 --> 1:36:17.520]  concerns over marshal on america on par with islamic extremism an la times
[1:36:17.520 --> 1:36:22.160]  report which characterizes the sovereign citizens movement as a major threat
[1:36:22.160 --> 1:36:28.160]  quote on a par with islamic extremism uh infers that the more than hundred
[1:36:28.160 --> 1:36:31.920]  thousand americans are quote domestic terrorists as a result of their
[1:36:31.920 --> 1:36:36.800]  affiliation with any type of talk of i'm independent i'm free from government
[1:36:36.800 --> 1:36:40.080]  you know what you're doing government is illegitimate all your selectively
[1:36:40.080 --> 1:36:43.600]  enforced garbage i'm not listening to it
[1:36:43.600 --> 1:36:48.080]  the article entitled sovereign citizen movement now on fbis radar
[1:36:48.080 --> 1:36:52.800]  uh frames with the belief that the us is increasingly under marshal law
[1:36:52.800 --> 1:36:57.440]  which they admit there that's what federal takeover is
[1:36:57.440 --> 1:37:03.440]  along with some gold standard oh that's evil to want constitutional money
[1:37:03.440 --> 1:37:08.080]  and political views indicative of violent extremism
[1:37:08.080 --> 1:37:11.600]  the report quotes mark potock of the southern
[1:37:11.600 --> 1:37:16.480]  poverty law center who in one fell swoop demonizes more than a hundred
[1:37:16.480 --> 1:37:20.640]  thousand americans as domestic terrorist and he goes on i'm gonna cover
[1:37:20.640 --> 1:37:24.480]  this more with our next guest that's coming up in about
[1:37:24.480 --> 1:37:28.800]  23 minutes or so that of course is sheriff mac who's being demonized for
[1:37:28.800 --> 1:37:31.840]  daring to say sheriffs follow the bill of rights and constitution
[1:37:31.840 --> 1:37:36.720]  but here uh is our guest david sardy who's a victim of all this demonization
[1:37:36.720 --> 1:37:39.120]  and medical mafia right now to talk about it
[1:37:39.120 --> 1:37:42.560]  please continue with your case and what you think of what i just covered sir
[1:37:42.560 --> 1:37:46.400]  oh yeah i mean there that we may disagree on
[1:37:46.400 --> 1:37:50.640]  many things but uh we have a viral government right now
[1:37:50.640 --> 1:37:54.560]  that is totally out of control i think we can both agree on that one
[1:37:54.560 --> 1:37:59.280]  uh yeah they're they're saying that we the people are going to go back and
[1:37:59.280 --> 1:38:02.640]  finish your story okay okay okay anyway yeah but
[1:38:02.640 --> 1:38:06.560]  expand on that but then i forgot that no expand on that but then
[1:38:06.560 --> 1:38:10.160]  um i forgot because we went to break as you were bringing up the whole
[1:38:10.160 --> 1:38:14.400]  uh you know getting the visit from the people that say eating meat as he is
[1:38:14.400 --> 1:38:17.680]  criminal well anyway that you know that that's through the
[1:38:17.680 --> 1:38:21.760]  sheriff's office so the sheriff's office may have had
[1:38:21.760 --> 1:38:25.440]  something against me anyway for because i'm not one to
[1:38:25.440 --> 1:38:28.960]  really shut up uh that's one of the few things i feel
[1:38:28.960 --> 1:38:32.960]  you know i need to i put it out there on my in my videos
[1:38:32.960 --> 1:38:36.880]  what how you know as part of being a prepper you have to be able to prepare
[1:38:36.880 --> 1:38:40.080]  your own food and unfortunately unless you're just total
[1:38:40.080 --> 1:38:43.840]  vegetarian death is part of your your uh you know you're
[1:38:43.840 --> 1:38:49.520]  going to have to kill something and eat it but anyway so i i got
[1:38:49.520 --> 1:38:54.800]  thrown out of there and then you know i even the the psychiatrist in the
[1:38:54.800 --> 1:38:57.520]  mentalist when i was in there for observation
[1:38:57.520 --> 1:39:02.400]  even wrote me up uh as as being uh uh delusional
[1:39:02.400 --> 1:39:06.960]  for saying that i knew my state senator i mean
[1:39:06.960 --> 1:39:11.520]  he'd never called her my state senator to check and see if i really knew her
[1:39:11.520 --> 1:39:15.120]  but you know and then i did fax her the letter where he wrote
[1:39:15.120 --> 1:39:19.280]  me being delusional for knowing her and she's got probably got that hanging on
[1:39:19.280 --> 1:39:23.600]  her wall right now because i'm nuts for it for being active and politically
[1:39:23.600 --> 1:39:27.680]  well listen you know statistically the highest level of suicide and mental
[1:39:27.680 --> 1:39:30.000]  illness this is a mainline statistic are
[1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:32.960]  psychologists and psychiatrists there are some good ones but
[1:39:32.960 --> 1:39:36.080]  by and large i mean these are people that get into this because they got
[1:39:36.080 --> 1:39:39.200]  scruzeless and a lot of them are on power trips
[1:39:39.200 --> 1:39:44.000]  uh and they've they've put out in the big dsr report of the hundreds of things
[1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:48.000]  they say are mental illness not trusting government as mental illness so
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:50.720]  thomas jefferson benjamin franklin george washington
[1:39:50.720 --> 1:39:56.160]  not trusting known liars so 91 of the american people are mentally ill because
[1:39:56.160 --> 1:39:59.200]  they don't trust congress and hate congress and national polls
[1:39:59.200 --> 1:40:02.640]  but yeah no i've seen that and i've seen cases of where
[1:40:02.640 --> 1:40:06.880]  uh that uh they just say everything is insane
[1:40:06.880 --> 1:40:10.080]  and it's all like this little joke like you're now mentally ill because we say
[1:40:10.080 --> 1:40:13.040]  so or you're a terrorist because the government funded
[1:40:13.040 --> 1:40:17.200]  traitorous southern poverty law center uh says you're bad and the southern
[1:40:17.200 --> 1:40:21.040]  poverty law center says sheriff max has killed cops we never said
[1:40:21.040 --> 1:40:24.240]  anything even near it and he's suing them over that
[1:40:24.240 --> 1:40:28.480]  uh but they said so so if they say the moon's made of cheese i mean potox said
[1:40:28.480 --> 1:40:32.000]  so and i mean potock is a simpering guy with a
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:36.240]  simpering voice and when you simper you know that means it's true i mean
[1:40:36.240 --> 1:40:40.560]  look they set themselves up as the authorities and the corporal media says
[1:40:40.560 --> 1:40:44.720]  this is the authority and we're all supposed to just oh we bow down
[1:40:44.720 --> 1:40:48.080]  you say families are bad we'll get rid of those you say the second amendments
[1:40:48.080 --> 1:40:50.880]  bad we'll get rid of that you say it's the law to take vaccines even
[1:40:50.880 --> 1:40:54.400]  though it's not we'll do what you say and we're not going to question you
[1:40:54.400 --> 1:40:59.680]  because questioning known liars critical thinking is conspiracy theory
[1:40:59.680 --> 1:41:02.800]  please continue all right yeah there's no doubt in my mind
[1:41:02.800 --> 1:41:07.040]  that i ran across at least two doctors with god complexes during this uh
[1:41:07.040 --> 1:41:13.520]  this whole thing so uh yeah now here's here's the whole rub of the whole
[1:41:13.520 --> 1:41:17.120]  situation put it down when i was taken out you know when
[1:41:17.120 --> 1:41:20.400]  when the judge said i was fine there's nothing wrong with me
[1:41:20.400 --> 1:41:23.680]  uh i was i was what do you call released
[1:41:23.680 --> 1:41:27.040]  the state of tennessee still keeps me on their computer
[1:41:27.040 --> 1:41:31.440]  as a mental defective just for having been submitted to uh
[1:41:31.440 --> 1:41:35.280]  to it and and the state of tennessee has no
[1:41:35.280 --> 1:41:39.760]  legal supposed legal mechanism to have that removed from their system
[1:41:39.760 --> 1:41:42.480]  so when it goes into the computer in the state of tennessee
[1:41:42.480 --> 1:41:46.800]  it also goes through the fbi and everything i can't i can't go work do
[1:41:46.800 --> 1:41:51.440]  violent it's like that all over the country and as you said this is
[1:41:51.440 --> 1:41:54.240]  oh well i want you to continue but i want people to really hear what you just
[1:41:54.240 --> 1:41:57.520]  said now for no reason they put people
[1:41:57.520 --> 1:42:01.680]  into mental evaluation if you get arrested
[1:42:01.680 --> 1:42:05.360]  for not paying tickets or whatever and complain and get angry
[1:42:05.360 --> 1:42:08.960]  they will say you're going into mental evaluation and now they put you in a
[1:42:08.960 --> 1:42:11.840]  file no judge no jury no conviction and now you
[1:42:11.840 --> 1:42:15.040]  can't own guns this is how they're going to try to get our second amendment
[1:42:15.040 --> 1:42:18.640]  uh continue breaking this down for people the judge said there's nothing
[1:42:18.640 --> 1:42:22.080]  wrong with this guy releasing they don't care though you're not going to get a
[1:42:22.080 --> 1:42:25.760]  gun because they're god right well it's not only guns
[1:42:25.760 --> 1:42:29.920]  i mean if i i drove a truck for 20 years and every trucking company runs
[1:42:29.920 --> 1:42:33.520]  background checks on you uh what company you know they're going to see
[1:42:33.520 --> 1:42:37.040]  a mental defective well they're not going to hire hire me if i if i get
[1:42:37.040 --> 1:42:41.040]  surgery and could get my physical stuff i that would stop me from going back to
[1:42:41.040 --> 1:42:44.800]  work i couldn't do volunteer work with the schools anymore
[1:42:44.800 --> 1:42:48.400]  all because uh because some some cardiologist
[1:42:48.400 --> 1:42:55.040]  decided that uh that i my ideas didn't meet his ideas you know so
[1:42:55.040 --> 1:42:59.120]  well that's that's that's that's right they're the high priest of control
[1:42:59.120 --> 1:43:03.120]  and this has happened since i did your last show i've got several emails
[1:43:03.120 --> 1:43:07.040]  from uh people that have been put through the same thing one woman
[1:43:07.040 --> 1:43:10.000]  because she divorced her husband he was a state trooper
[1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:13.840]  he put her in and now she's lost all her rights because she had to go for
[1:43:13.840 --> 1:43:19.360]  evaluation uh this is uh it is a total not just me
[1:43:19.360 --> 1:43:23.360]  but uh seen as i got the biggest mouth of everybody i figured it was a good
[1:43:23.360 --> 1:43:26.800]  time to fight this and try to get something overturned
[1:43:26.800 --> 1:43:30.400]  i mean uh i've got a lot of emails from people saying well
[1:43:30.400 --> 1:43:33.680]  you're just your own worst enemy because you're running your mouth i said well
[1:43:33.680 --> 1:43:37.360]  somebody has to run their mouth if george washington would have run
[1:43:37.360 --> 1:43:41.520]  in cocktail we would not none of us would be here somebody has to stand up well
[1:43:41.520 --> 1:43:44.960]  he was a mentally ill hold on he didn't like the government that's mentally
[1:43:44.960 --> 1:43:49.280]  ill you've got to get with the times joe stahl and good
[1:43:49.280 --> 1:43:53.760]  communists thugs control tyranny good george washton evil
[1:43:53.760 --> 1:43:57.200]  but you just hit the nail on the head right there people send me emails and
[1:43:57.200 --> 1:44:01.360]  say oh you need to quit complaining that's what freedoms all about is being
[1:44:01.360 --> 1:44:05.840]  involved and having an opinion and being engaged and demanding your rights
[1:44:05.840 --> 1:44:09.760]  i mean these sheep out there really get off on the system abusing them
[1:44:09.760 --> 1:44:13.680]  they love it that's that's why i i if anybody's
[1:44:13.680 --> 1:44:17.280]  also interested uh that one of the last few
[1:44:17.280 --> 1:44:21.040]  well i wouldn't say the last but one of the few honest politicians to ever come
[1:44:21.040 --> 1:44:23.840]  out of the state of tennessee was davie crocket
[1:44:23.840 --> 1:44:28.480]  which is also a reason that i i've chose this hat as a symbol
[1:44:28.480 --> 1:44:34.080]  of tennessee freedom uh anybody doesn't believe just read the uh the
[1:44:34.080 --> 1:44:38.800]  davie crocket was a guy that lived in the woods had no formal education
[1:44:38.800 --> 1:44:42.400]  and he went to washington and actually stood up to
[1:44:42.400 --> 1:44:46.160]  andrew jackson i mean just because andrew jackson was from tennessee
[1:44:46.160 --> 1:44:48.880]  you know crocket just said well this is wrong that's right
[1:44:48.880 --> 1:44:53.200]  simple right and wrong decisions uh it's it's
[1:44:53.200 --> 1:44:56.800]  how would you say common sense i mean that's all that's what's why well they
[1:44:56.800 --> 1:45:01.040]  call that all they call that all kind of well in rockin all that that's a
[1:45:01.040 --> 1:45:05.440]  that's all kind of yeah well this is the i guess this would be the american
[1:45:05.440 --> 1:45:09.840]  al-qaeda hat then uh now i wouldn't that's i wouldn't
[1:45:09.840 --> 1:45:13.760]  american al-qaeda which they're now hyping and again keep saying
[1:45:13.760 --> 1:45:17.360]  hat a fraction of our audience is watching at prison planet
[1:45:17.360 --> 1:45:20.480]  dot tv right now most of them are radio listeners but that you're wearing a
[1:45:20.480 --> 1:45:24.480]  coonscan evil wicked right-wing extremist uh
[1:45:24.480 --> 1:45:29.600]  fustunable yeah because you know it's real fur it's a real animal
[1:45:29.600 --> 1:45:33.920]  an animal gave its life to make my headgear and you know a lot of people
[1:45:33.920 --> 1:45:36.400]  don't think about that when they put their shoes on
[1:45:36.400 --> 1:45:41.120]  or when they go to go to mcdonald's and get those chicken nuggets no animals
[1:45:41.120 --> 1:45:45.280]  were harmed in the making oh no i've had people get in
[1:45:45.280 --> 1:45:50.000]  i've actually we bought my son a few years ago a coonscan cap a real one
[1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:53.520]  uh and he's we've even had a few comments of like oh my gosh that's you an
[1:45:53.520 --> 1:45:56.480]  animal was killed for that i'm like do you eat meat well yeah
[1:45:56.480 --> 1:46:01.280]  see it it's just disconnected from reality i was walking on the beach today
[1:46:01.280 --> 1:46:06.400]  and uh i mean every 500 yards we might have seen a little dead jellyfish
[1:46:06.400 --> 1:46:10.080]  and and we were walking by these women and we had our french bulldog we were
[1:46:10.080 --> 1:46:13.040]  walking with the children and the woman comes there goes oh what a
[1:46:13.040 --> 1:46:16.560]  nice dog and then has this look and i thought oh here it comes i'm gonna get
[1:46:16.560 --> 1:46:19.360]  boston henpeck somehow because it's like all the time now
[1:46:19.360 --> 1:46:22.160]  and she goes you shouldn't be out here there's jellyfish and was like looking
[1:46:22.160 --> 1:46:25.760]  me like i was wrong and i had some mentally ill look on her face
[1:46:25.760 --> 1:46:28.800]  and these are the people that serve the system they're like these incredible
[1:46:28.800 --> 1:46:32.640]  cowards they hate men and they want you to know i'm
[1:46:32.640 --> 1:46:36.320]  going to use the system on you and i'm going to use safety
[1:46:36.320 --> 1:46:40.640]  as a way to one up you morally and at least like act like you're warning me at
[1:46:40.640 --> 1:46:43.360]  first it was like watch out for jellyfish and i was i looked at her and
[1:46:43.360 --> 1:46:45.840]  smiled i said i know what's coming this is that before
[1:46:45.840 --> 1:46:49.520]  she goes she goes should they be out here there's there's jellyfish
[1:46:49.520 --> 1:46:52.320]  yeah and like gave me this guilt look like you
[1:46:52.320 --> 1:46:56.800]  bad i've looked at her very sadly but but it's worse than that i've been on the
[1:46:56.800 --> 1:46:59.920]  texas beaches and there's no riptide
[1:46:59.920 --> 1:47:04.080]  there's like a you know one foot waves coming in my kids are digging in the
[1:47:04.080 --> 1:47:08.000]  edge of the sand not even in three inches of water where waves are coming in
[1:47:08.000 --> 1:47:11.440]  and one time it happened like 10 times in one day
[1:47:11.440 --> 1:47:15.040]  men women would walk by and say they shouldn't be close to the water
[1:47:15.040 --> 1:47:21.680]  they they should be wearing uh what do you call them life jackets and i would
[1:47:21.680 --> 1:47:25.440]  look at them and i mean last time this happened my kids were like
[1:47:25.440 --> 1:47:29.840]  like five and seven great swimmers but you know the texas coast it goes out for
[1:47:29.840 --> 1:47:34.080]  like six inches deep there in port aransas for like 50 yards and
[1:47:34.080 --> 1:47:37.280]  they're on the edge with little waves coming up they're like
[1:47:37.280 --> 1:47:41.120]  half an inch deep and and and they're digging holes in the
[1:47:41.120 --> 1:47:44.320]  sand and i look at these people like they're crazy they are
[1:47:44.320 --> 1:47:48.000]  they really believe al-qaeda is going to get them when you got a better chance
[1:47:48.000 --> 1:47:51.200]  of a deer jumping out in front of your car and killing you or champagne court
[1:47:51.200 --> 1:47:55.920]  popping wrong and killing you literally and they live in this false world where
[1:47:55.920 --> 1:47:59.760]  the other humans are bad they're gonna hend peck you they're gonna say
[1:47:59.760 --> 1:48:03.600]  you're doing something wrong and it's usually i gotta say it what you call
[1:48:03.600 --> 1:48:06.720]  liberals so-called liberals they're not really liberals they're like state
[1:48:06.720 --> 1:48:11.040]  worshipers and they want to they want to hend peck you they want
[1:48:11.040 --> 1:48:17.520]  they it's like a deal i'm like wanting to pray it's like a deal
[1:48:17.520 --> 1:48:21.280]  wanting to say the family's bad wanting to attack the family wanting to see
[1:48:21.280 --> 1:48:25.600]  you're not a good parents my wife probably now 10 times or more
[1:48:25.600 --> 1:48:29.280]  has been in whole foods getting organic food or trying to
[1:48:29.280 --> 1:48:32.800]  and had trendies come over and say why do you have three children that's bad for
[1:48:32.800 --> 1:48:35.840]  the earth like she meant she's supposed to apologize
[1:48:35.840 --> 1:48:39.760]  she just says what you talking about brainwashed but i mean this is what we've
[1:48:39.760 --> 1:48:43.520]  turned into total nation of nanny chicken next
[1:48:43.520 --> 1:48:49.120]  america is now land of the sycophantic mentally ill totally screwed up
[1:48:49.120 --> 1:48:53.200]  drugheads on prozac and riddle and visiting totally screwed up shrinks
[1:48:53.200 --> 1:48:57.360]  who are waging war against reality now it's a dichotomy there's those people
[1:48:57.360 --> 1:49:00.720]  and then good americans who want basic liberty and freedom and can skin a
[1:49:00.720 --> 1:49:04.000]  buck around a frontline and actually work for a living and
[1:49:04.000 --> 1:49:07.360]  uh... but i'm sorry i'm ranting what do you think about what i just said

[1:49:12.080 --> 1:49:17.760]  yes i can hear you okay anyway uh... yeah there we call them safety sally's
[1:49:17.760 --> 1:49:22.160]  i mean there's a bunch of little i don't know who they are i'm i'm i was
[1:49:22.160 --> 1:49:24.960]  fixing to say little old women that sit around wait wait wait wait wait you've

[1:49:29.600 --> 1:49:34.320]  safety sally's yeah uh... they they sit around and they're like
[1:49:34.320 --> 1:49:38.480]  they sit in their armchair and they they sit there and think of ways that you
[1:49:38.480 --> 1:49:42.560]  should be doing stuff yeah you you got you got to do that this way it's just
[1:49:42.560 --> 1:49:46.960]  like when i'm when i'm showing a gun on online here
[1:49:46.960 --> 1:49:51.520]  uh... did you safety check that it's like look there's a camera the bullet
[1:49:51.520 --> 1:49:55.040]  can't go through that camera and get you don't you worry about it
[1:49:55.040 --> 1:49:58.720]  i feel safe with it because i know what i'm doing i've been messing with these
[1:49:58.720 --> 1:50:02.720]  things and i was eight years old you know don't worry about what i'm doing i'm
[1:50:02.720 --> 1:50:08.480]  going to show you know anyway it's little things like that people people i think

[1:50:11.840 --> 1:50:16.400]  better to do than think of some ways that they can tell somebody else how to
[1:50:16.400 --> 1:50:20.880]  mind their own business you know that that's where you know
[1:50:20.880 --> 1:50:26.240]  that's that's another way to look at the government these are armchair sally's
[1:50:26.240 --> 1:50:30.640]  mm-hmm exactly this is the nanny state well well
[1:50:30.640 --> 1:50:34.720]  i've told the story of i had a dog a lab he's dead now he lived about 14 named
[1:50:34.720 --> 1:50:39.120]  helmet and he climbed out of the fence one time
[1:50:39.120 --> 1:50:43.920]  and got hit and so his leg was paralyzed they wanted to chop it off
[1:50:43.920 --> 1:50:48.480]  i said no most the feeling came back but he'd have to swing it to walk
[1:50:48.480 --> 1:50:52.320]  and i'd get hen pecked so bad that i had to give him away to folks that had
[1:50:52.320 --> 1:50:55.520]  property just so i wouldn't get hen pecked so hard i mean i got hen pecked
[1:50:55.520 --> 1:50:58.160]  so hard that i was beating his arm and left
[1:50:58.160 --> 1:51:01.280]  stickers in it when i went out that i had to give the dog to my parents that had
[1:51:01.280 --> 1:51:04.480]  property because the hens hit me and hit me hard folks if you

[1:54:28.320 --> 1:54:32.000]  and a half ago that one of the people that's on the doomsday preppers that i
[1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:35.600]  hear all this hype about it had his gun taken
[1:54:35.600 --> 1:54:39.280]  extruditially so i got him on and every point he brings up i start chomping at
[1:54:39.280 --> 1:54:42.800]  the bit because all the points he's making i can finish the sentence he can
[1:54:42.800 --> 1:54:46.160]  finish my sentence we've just got him for five more minutes than a break and
[1:54:46.160 --> 1:54:49.680]  then five more minutes than sheriff mac at the eight after segments going to be
[1:54:49.680 --> 1:54:53.840]  in studio with us but uh wow i didn't know they had a name
[1:54:53.840 --> 1:54:58.320]  for it i'm declaring war on safety salaries
[1:54:58.320 --> 1:55:04.480]  because they're and it's men and women they are always in your face
[1:55:04.480 --> 1:55:09.200]  they always mess with you they always make stuff up they never know what
[1:55:09.200 --> 1:55:12.400]  they're talking about and you're just sitting there on the side of the beach
[1:55:12.400 --> 1:55:15.280]  and there's little tiny waves your kids are sitting there digging the center
[1:55:15.280 --> 1:55:18.640]  like that's dangerous water that's dangerous water they and you're
[1:55:18.640 --> 1:55:21.840]  looking at them going what these are the people if you
[1:55:21.840 --> 1:55:25.440]  have a gun in the rack of your truck even in rural areas now
[1:55:25.440 --> 1:55:29.120]  people can't do that because they call the cops and the cops respond
[1:55:29.120 --> 1:55:32.080]  somebody puts a gun in the back of their car to go to the shooting range cops get
[1:55:32.080 --> 1:55:35.520]  called even in rural areas i saw a gun there's a safety
[1:55:35.520 --> 1:55:39.200]  salary driving through your country area and the cops respond to safety
[1:55:39.200 --> 1:55:42.880]  salaries the safety salaries think it's illegal
[1:55:42.880 --> 1:55:46.800]  uh i've i've seen cases where people are branding
[1:55:46.800 --> 1:55:51.840]  cows at a feedlot and people are driving by and see it and call the police
[1:55:51.840 --> 1:55:56.000]  and the police show up i've seen cases famous cases where somebody's got a
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:55:59.920]  rat in their backyard even in rural areas in their
[1:55:59.920 --> 1:56:03.280]  gardens they put a rat trap out and then the
[1:56:03.280 --> 1:56:07.040]  government comes and charges them with animal cruelty you're like that's not
[1:56:07.040 --> 1:56:10.400]  serious yeah it is all over the u.s now they're
[1:56:10.400 --> 1:56:14.240]  announcing starting chicago last year you can't pack your own child's lunch
[1:56:14.240 --> 1:56:17.680]  because the school says you can't be trusted it's really about them making

[2:00:29.840 --> 2:00:33.520]  safety like the state police we're public safety
[2:00:33.520 --> 2:00:36.400]  and then oh safety there's no below rights or constitution or private
[2:00:36.400 --> 2:00:42.240]  property rights or free choice if it's safety meanwhile they push an entire
[2:00:42.240 --> 2:00:45.200]  agenda that is completely unsafe we're talking to
[2:00:45.200 --> 2:00:49.200]  david sardy one of the folks that's on the show or been on the show
[2:00:49.200 --> 2:00:54.320]  preppers doomsday preppers you know the truth is the doomsday situation is
[2:00:54.320 --> 2:00:58.320]  nuclear war it's solar flare things like that we
[2:00:58.320 --> 2:01:01.760]  should always be prepared that's just common sense the government's prepared
[2:01:01.760 --> 2:01:07.280]  but says that we're cookie to be prepared and i think we're going to be
[2:01:07.280 --> 2:01:10.320]  here after 2012 i think everything's going to be all right if the globalists
[2:01:10.320 --> 2:01:13.680]  don't don't you know cause a problem governments
[2:01:13.680 --> 2:01:18.800]  demo side number one cause of death in the 20th century was government 260
[2:01:18.800 --> 2:01:23.200]  plus million people david what's your view on
[2:01:23.200 --> 2:01:26.800]  crises or doomsday scenarios why are you prepping
[2:01:26.800 --> 2:01:30.480]  well uh it goes back to a long time ago i mean
[2:01:30.480 --> 2:01:34.320]  even when i was younger i was in the boy scouts you always prepare for the
[2:01:34.320 --> 2:01:37.520]  worst and hope for the best now i consider
[2:01:37.520 --> 2:01:40.720]  a worst-case scenario would be into this country
[2:01:40.720 --> 2:01:43.920]  would be an emp because everything runs on electronics
[2:01:43.920 --> 2:01:48.160]  the trucks are computerized with that they like that and i consider that
[2:01:48.160 --> 2:01:54.160]  worst-case scenario for us so i try to lean my stuff
[2:01:54.160 --> 2:01:58.160]  toward that so if i'm prepared for that that means
[2:01:58.160 --> 2:02:04.080]  ice storms and and other little you know if the madrid fault goes i mean
[2:02:04.080 --> 2:02:08.240]  if any of that stuff happens all the stuff i've prepared for emp will work
[2:02:08.240 --> 2:02:12.560]  just as well for the other if you're it the big thing you have to know is your
[2:02:12.560 --> 2:02:16.000]  location and if you're if you live on the
[2:02:16.000 --> 2:02:19.520]  coast of florida and you're only two or three foot above sea level
[2:02:19.520 --> 2:02:23.760]  you need to have a bug out plan okay if you you know if you live next to a
[2:02:23.760 --> 2:02:26.560]  volcano you need to have a bug out plan
[2:02:26.560 --> 2:02:30.320]  now and you it a lot you a lot of it is
[2:02:30.320 --> 2:02:34.720]  knowing the dangers in the area where you are located
[2:02:34.720 --> 2:02:40.160]  so uh that's my view and the reason
[2:02:40.640 --> 2:02:44.480]  and the reason the system hates this i want to get your take on this
[2:02:44.480 --> 2:02:50.560]  uh is because anytime we start thinking for ourselves and being
[2:02:50.560 --> 2:02:54.160]  wily that's that's called not being domesticated
[2:02:54.160 --> 2:02:59.360]  they want us just these mindless domesticated creatures who don't
[2:02:59.360 --> 2:03:02.800]  think about threats because we'll recognize the government's a big threat
[2:03:02.800 --> 2:03:06.160]  as well go ahead oh yeah they're they're
[2:03:06.160 --> 2:03:10.160]  on my daily prepper report that the highest rated threat to the american
[2:03:10.160 --> 2:03:13.440]  people today is the government it's the viral government

[2:03:46.560 --> 2:03:51.280]  their spending uh you try i tried to give my school uh

[2:08:07.520 --> 2:08:11.760]  war continues it's alex jones and the gcn radio
[2:08:11.760 --> 2:08:20.240]  network
[2:08:20.400 --> 2:08:25.760]  we are now into our number three without a jam pack transmission so far
[2:08:25.760 --> 2:08:29.120]  today obviously i want to go into a host of issues with
[2:08:29.120 --> 2:08:33.760]  sheriff richard mac today he had one of the most important landmark second
[2:08:33.760 --> 2:08:37.040]  amendment cases back in the mid-1990s it was also a tent
[2:08:37.040 --> 2:08:39.760]  amendment states rights case and the supreme court ruled
[2:08:39.760 --> 2:08:43.920]  the federal government could not have the waiting period to buy firearms
[2:08:43.920 --> 2:08:47.680]  that it was a restriction on the second amendment then they just brought in the
[2:08:47.680 --> 2:08:50.960]  instant check which became basically an instant ban
[2:08:50.960 --> 2:08:54.240]  but in that ruling it clearly states what we already knew
[2:08:54.240 --> 2:08:58.160]  the feds are out of their jurisdiction when it comes to the second amendment
[2:08:58.160 --> 2:09:00.880]  trying to restrict law abiding citizens
[2:09:00.880 --> 2:09:04.160]  now since then sheriff mac has worked to get sheriffs
[2:09:04.160 --> 2:09:09.280]  informed about their duty in the bill of rights constitution
[2:09:09.280 --> 2:09:12.880]  in the old days when the feds tried to come to your office or business they
[2:09:12.880 --> 2:09:16.560]  brought the police with them in fact still in austin when i've had the fbi
[2:09:16.560 --> 2:09:20.160]  visit before because they had a subpoena
[2:09:20.160 --> 2:09:22.880]  some idiot was threatening people on the message board or whatever and they
[2:09:22.880 --> 2:09:26.800]  wanted to find the ip address they had local police with them
[2:09:26.800 --> 2:09:30.560]  atf once showed up had local police with them more and more they don't have local
[2:09:30.560 --> 2:09:34.640]  police so the the the entire jurisdiction
[2:09:34.640 --> 2:09:37.760]  is is being erased and the feds are now involved in everything they weren't
[2:09:37.760 --> 2:09:41.360]  involved in just 20 years ago the tsa isn't even sworn peace
[2:09:41.360 --> 2:09:45.840]  officers and they're doing things the fbi won't do going in your pants
[2:09:45.840 --> 2:09:49.120]  the government has created a new agency because they couldn't get the fbi to do
[2:09:49.120 --> 2:09:50.960]  things like that they just hire a bunch of brown
[2:09:50.960 --> 2:09:54.080]  search that don't know any better this is a power grab and now
[2:09:54.080 --> 2:09:57.360]  from dallas to boston there's tsa on the ground
[2:09:57.360 --> 2:10:01.280]  coming up and grabbing you and your family you thought you would just not
[2:10:01.280 --> 2:10:05.760]  fly they're coming after everybody it's a tent amendment power grab it's
[2:10:05.760 --> 2:10:09.760]  a fourth amendment power grab and so he had a big event and
[2:10:09.760 --> 2:10:12.320]  over a hundred sheriffs showed up and he wants to start having more of them
[2:10:12.320 --> 2:10:15.680]  just to read from bill rights constitution to talk about
[2:10:15.680 --> 2:10:21.280]  his book uh you know the sheriff america's last hope
[2:10:21.280 --> 2:10:25.120]  uh ultimate enforcers of the constitution protectors against government
[2:10:25.120 --> 2:10:29.760]  tyranny america's last hope uh brave oaf keepers that's the denver post
[2:10:29.760 --> 2:10:34.240]  emerging movement encourages sheriffs to act as shields against federal tyranny
[2:10:34.240 --> 2:10:38.640]  the 100 or so sheriffs gathered uh in los vegas ball
[2:10:38.640 --> 2:10:41.920]  hotel ballroom two weeks ago learned that some
[2:10:41.920 --> 2:10:46.080]  uh weighty titles have been attached to their stars they wear on their chest so
[2:10:46.080 --> 2:10:50.720]  it's a condescending thing you know you're making fun of
[2:10:50.720 --> 2:10:54.400]  pointing out that sheriffs are the elected people
[2:10:54.400 --> 2:10:58.720]  protectors that they are the folks that are there to call out the citizens for
[2:10:58.720 --> 2:11:02.640]  aid if needed this is constitutional government but they make a big joke out
[2:11:02.640 --> 2:11:06.160]  of it because the feds are trying to have the the states
[2:11:06.160 --> 2:11:10.640]  through the cities absorb the counties which is completely backwards
[2:11:10.640 --> 2:11:14.480]  ultimate enforcers of the constitution protectors against government tyranny
[2:11:14.480 --> 2:11:19.280]  america's last hope brave oath keepers and the sheriffs including eight from
[2:11:19.280 --> 2:11:21.440]  colorado learned that they needed to protect their
[2:11:21.440 --> 2:11:25.200]  citizenry for much more than local lawbreakers in today's world
[2:11:25.200 --> 2:11:28.080]  public enemy number one just might be the federal government you mean the
[2:11:28.080 --> 2:11:31.120]  folks shipping guns into mexico and blaming the second amendment or caught
[2:11:31.120 --> 2:11:33.040]  shipping drugs in you mean the ones that released
[2:11:33.040 --> 2:11:36.160]  in texas alone houston chronicle reported in one year
[2:11:36.160 --> 2:11:40.800]  over 200 000 violent felon illegals they released them and don't even deport
[2:11:40.800 --> 2:11:44.000]  them yeah i think the federal government's been taken over and
[2:11:44.000 --> 2:11:47.680]  is enemy number one it's not our government anymore
[2:11:47.680 --> 2:11:50.320]  in today's world public enemy number one might just might be the federal
[2:11:50.320 --> 2:11:53.760]  government or the out of control federal bureaucracy as organizers of the
[2:11:53.760 --> 2:11:57.600]  convention like to refer to it the person who will stand tall against
[2:11:57.600 --> 2:12:00.560]  federal tyranny even if it means armed resistance according to the
[2:12:00.560 --> 2:12:04.240]  organizers is the county sheriff they are so afraid of that ladies and
[2:12:04.240 --> 2:12:07.600]  gentlemen the whole p
[2:12:08.240 --> 2:12:11.840]  war defense authorization act is about if you take your state back it says
[2:12:11.840 --> 2:12:15.520]  have federal troops come in over the state this is
[2:12:15.520 --> 2:12:19.920]  texas tried to pass a law saying tsa has to follow the law can't touch your
[2:12:19.920 --> 2:12:23.280]  genitals and the fed said we'll have a blockade of
[2:12:23.280 --> 2:12:27.360]  air travel we'll block physically a blockade an act of war that was on the
[2:12:27.360 --> 2:12:30.000]  news last year
[2:12:31.120 --> 2:12:35.520]  and it goes on total demonization total panicking of sheriff mac that
[2:12:35.520 --> 2:12:39.440]  organized it they hate mac because he's a go-getter one at the supreme court
[2:12:39.440 --> 2:12:42.960]  he's a good guy he never talks about violence
[2:12:42.960 --> 2:12:46.160]  that's why he's having to sue the southern poverty slime center
[2:12:46.160 --> 2:12:48.880]  i want to talk about that with him today because they said he calls for
[2:12:48.880 --> 2:12:51.840]  killing cops and he said show me for a year where i said that
[2:12:51.840 --> 2:12:55.200]  they said okay we'll do a little retraction didn't really do it so he's
[2:12:55.200 --> 2:12:58.400]  suing them now they think they can just do whatever they want
[2:12:58.400 --> 2:13:01.200]  okay because they represent the foreign banks taking over this country
[2:13:01.200 --> 2:13:06.560]  sheriff mac joins us to talk about this and more today from the info wars.com
[2:13:06.560 --> 2:13:10.720]  studios and a sheriff it is good to have you here with us
[2:13:10.720 --> 2:13:14.880]  give us a report on your event the meeting the demonization
[2:13:14.880 --> 2:13:19.040]  and and then we'll get into the ndaa everything we warned about now
[2:13:19.040 --> 2:13:23.040]  manifesting which gives us more credibility than ever they're so scared
[2:13:23.040 --> 2:13:27.920]  of sheriffs rediscovering their duty as elected representatives of the people
[2:13:27.920 --> 2:13:32.800]  how dare someone at a county level actually follow their oath this is
[2:13:32.800 --> 2:13:36.640]  horrible what you're doing well alex thanks uh
[2:13:36.640 --> 2:13:40.800]  sorry i'm not in orlanda with you i'd i'd love to be there with you um
[2:13:40.800 --> 2:13:44.240]  yeah the convention for the constitutional sheriffs was
[2:13:44.240 --> 2:13:49.040]  absolutely successful it was absolutely a miracle
[2:13:49.040 --> 2:13:53.360]  all the volunteers felt it alex i'm telling you this is
[2:13:53.360 --> 2:13:57.600]  the good news of what you and i have been working on for decades
[2:13:57.600 --> 2:14:04.640]  this was really a powerful patriotic freedom enhancing
[2:14:04.640 --> 2:14:10.640]  convention it was again as you mentioned my message has been one of peace
[2:14:10.640 --> 2:14:14.880]  solutions and that just like you mentioned about my book the county
[2:14:14.880 --> 2:14:19.200]  sheriff america's last hope this is a way for us
[2:14:19.200 --> 2:14:24.560]  to provide and this is a theme of course for all police and sheriffs nationwide
[2:14:24.560 --> 2:14:27.840]  to serve and protect that's all we're talking about
[2:14:27.840 --> 2:14:32.720]  we simply want our nation's police officers and of course the sheriffs who
[2:14:32.720 --> 2:14:36.320]  are the only elected police officer in the country
[2:14:36.320 --> 2:14:40.640]  to keep their oath and if government comes in and as you've mentioned on
[2:14:40.640 --> 2:14:44.400]  info wars on your website when they declare war on
[2:14:44.400 --> 2:14:49.600]  amish farmers who deal in raw milk and now they want to put these good
[2:14:49.600 --> 2:14:54.640]  honest americans in prison and jail and destroy their land and farms
[2:14:54.640 --> 2:14:57.840]  who is it that will three years in prison they're facing that's in
[2:14:57.840 --> 2:15:01.520]  that's in the news today three years in prison now for the amish yeah
[2:15:01.520 --> 2:15:05.120]  yeah and and these people have never heard anybody and i've been
[2:15:05.120 --> 2:15:08.960]  helping vernon hershberger in wisconsin uh who
[2:15:08.960 --> 2:15:13.600]  deals in raw milk and i was on his farm and i ate a complete
[2:15:13.600 --> 2:15:19.600]  farm organic meal with him and his kids and i drank raw milk in public
[2:15:19.600 --> 2:15:22.880]  um and also at our convention with the sheriffs
[2:15:22.880 --> 2:15:26.800]  at lunchtime i had max kane bring in some raw milk
[2:15:26.800 --> 2:15:30.320]  and i drank raw milk in front of all the sheriffs
[2:15:30.320 --> 2:15:33.840]  so they could see how stupid this is and how silly
[2:15:33.840 --> 2:15:37.760]  and and the comparison that i make there with the raw milk is i compare it to
[2:15:37.760 --> 2:15:40.880]  rosa parts rosa and our government just
[2:15:40.880 --> 2:15:45.760]  brags now that we don't arrest people anymore for failing to get to the back
[2:15:45.760 --> 2:15:48.800]  of the bus well that's a flat out lie
[2:15:48.800 --> 2:15:51.760]  uh all we have done is switch it to other people
[2:15:51.760 --> 2:15:56.080]  and isn't it absolutely hypocritical and so stupid that we claim
[2:15:56.080 --> 2:15:59.760]  that we don't arrest people for failing to give their seat to a white man
[2:15:59.760 --> 2:16:04.560]  but we will arrest you and put you in jail for three years as you mentioned
[2:16:04.560 --> 2:16:09.680]  for not pasteurizing your milk and that's how stupid our government has
[2:16:09.680 --> 2:16:13.360]  gotten and that's why i have worked so hard
[2:16:13.360 --> 2:16:17.120]  with the sheriffs so that they know and understand that they are the ultimate
[2:16:17.120 --> 2:16:20.160]  line in the sand they are the ultimate defense for the
[2:16:20.160 --> 2:16:23.120]  people in this country and there should not be one
[2:16:23.120 --> 2:16:27.760]  amish farmer or any atheist farmer for that matter i don't care what religion
[2:16:27.760 --> 2:16:31.520]  they are not go to jail because they deal in raw
[2:16:31.520 --> 2:16:35.760]  milk or they don't pasteurize their milk how absurd can we get
[2:16:35.760 --> 2:16:39.840]  and and i even have a compromise that would even allow government to get
[2:16:39.840 --> 2:16:42.480]  involved in this issue that the amish farmers
[2:16:42.480 --> 2:16:46.640]  and other farmers are not against just simply put a sign
[2:16:46.640 --> 2:16:50.320]  in front of the farm stating the same thing that cigarettes say
[2:16:50.320 --> 2:16:53.600]  warning this product might be dangerous to your health
[2:16:53.600 --> 2:16:57.760]  what's wrong with that we put it on the on cigarettes which we know are going to
[2:16:57.760 --> 2:17:00.240]  kill people well let me stop you're right there
[2:17:00.240 --> 2:17:03.600]  there let me stop you're right there go ahead
[2:17:03.600 --> 2:17:06.640]  yeah sheriff let me let me stop you're right there we had a big
[2:17:06.640 --> 2:17:11.040]  statistic study article the natural news did just two days ago
[2:17:11.040 --> 2:17:14.000]  that that mike adams put out in the drudge report link to
[2:17:14.000 --> 2:17:18.560]  and i'm going for memory but it's regular milk pasteurized boiled
[2:17:18.560 --> 2:17:23.680]  it's not even real milk burn has a hundred and fifty times the
[2:17:23.680 --> 2:17:28.160]  yes a hundred and fifty times the the the
[2:17:28.160 --> 2:17:32.000]  a manure blood pus the big industry wants to cook it
[2:17:32.000 --> 2:17:36.160]  so they can give you a crud raw milk has to be clean and pure
[2:17:36.160 --> 2:17:40.160]  i mean it's incredible but but shifting gears this is the key to all this
[2:17:40.160 --> 2:17:45.200]  the reason they're so scared of you is they mentioned here in the denver post
[2:17:45.200 --> 2:17:49.120]  that when the epa when the new regulations when the bureaucrats try to
[2:17:49.120 --> 2:17:52.240]  go on people's property you know they're telling sheriffs
[2:17:52.240 --> 2:17:54.720]  you know don't let them well you're saying make
[2:17:54.720 --> 2:17:58.320]  all these new agencies follow the constitution be in control of your
[2:17:58.320 --> 2:18:02.320]  county make them check in with you this gets in the way of agenda 21
[2:18:02.320 --> 2:18:06.240]  and their plan to come in with the hordes of bureaucrats and eat out our
[2:18:06.240 --> 2:18:09.120]  substance you're trying to reawaken america
[2:18:09.120 --> 2:18:12.720]  you're trying to do something as american as apple pie and this is like
[2:18:12.720 --> 2:18:17.760]  holy water to vampires that's a good way to put it
[2:18:17.760 --> 2:18:22.960]  that's almost as good as safety sally um quite frankly alex you're absolutely
[2:18:22.960 --> 2:18:27.440]  right uh we did have a good presentation
[2:18:27.440 --> 2:18:31.840]  about agenda 21 at our event but we took it step by step
[2:18:31.840 --> 2:18:35.360]  it was a clock it was a block on block approach
[2:18:35.360 --> 2:18:40.000]  okay a block building we started with all the abuses going on
[2:18:40.000 --> 2:18:44.960]  in about a 15 minute video then michael badnaric came in and spoke an hour
[2:18:44.960 --> 2:18:50.160]  about the bill of rights i reviewed my case that you already talked about
[2:18:50.160 --> 2:18:54.640]  that this addressed jurisdiction and that my case proved that the federal
[2:18:54.640 --> 2:18:57.280]  government does not have jurisdiction in our counties
[2:18:57.280 --> 2:19:00.880]  and that local officials are the ones in charge
[2:19:00.880 --> 2:19:04.720]  and then right after that we went on break and i have to tell you
[2:19:04.720 --> 2:19:08.960]  a sheriff from texas came up to me and he said you know sheriff mac i got to
[2:19:08.960 --> 2:19:12.240]  tell you i was really wondering about coming
[2:19:12.240 --> 2:19:15.440]  to this convention and then he put his hands up to his
[2:19:15.440 --> 2:19:20.800]  face like this and he said you got me and you see alex that was the feeling
[2:19:20.800 --> 2:19:24.480]  in the room the whole time the founding fathers were
[2:19:24.480 --> 2:19:28.240]  walking around in that room it just felt like something so historic
[2:19:28.240 --> 2:19:32.560]  so powerful so patriotic so foundational and fundamental
[2:19:32.560 --> 2:19:35.840]  so constitutional the sheriffs that were there
[2:19:35.840 --> 2:19:41.600]  loved it they were engaged and they were dedicated to this cause
[2:19:41.600 --> 2:19:45.120]  amazing you were feeling the tide turning when we come back
[2:19:45.120 --> 2:19:49.520]  i want you to go over the abuses go over the solutions
[2:19:49.520 --> 2:19:53.040]  in fact i'm gonna try to just sit back and give you the floor to break down
[2:19:53.040 --> 2:19:56.960]  what you did there to give us a flavor of that and how this is a key
[2:19:56.960 --> 2:20:00.560]  shink in the globalist armor this is the tide turning
[2:20:00.560 --> 2:20:04.800]  that's the feeling it's electric it's destiny i'm gonna do a lot of research
[2:20:04.800 --> 2:20:08.560]  into why even if i had a pretty good size meal that i was still starving
[2:20:08.560 --> 2:20:12.800]  and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we
[2:20:12.800 --> 2:20:15.920]  grow our crops on here in the united states and across the industrialized
[2:20:15.920 --> 2:20:20.160]  world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key
[2:20:20.160 --> 2:20:24.640]  minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight

[2:24:18.160 --> 2:24:23.360]  all right this is very elementary this is a short segment long 18 minute
[2:24:23.360 --> 2:24:26.240]  segment coming up in a five minute segment with sheriff Richard Mack in
[2:24:26.240 --> 2:24:29.520]  studio with us and he's offered to coho

[2:24:38.160 --> 2:24:40.160]  introduce it with this point and i'm going to turn
[2:24:40.160 --> 2:24:44.320]  over much of this hour to you it's very elementary
[2:24:44.320 --> 2:24:47.360]  the globalists know there's money and power and taken over government and
[2:24:47.360 --> 2:24:50.160]  taxing and controlling people that's the history of the world
[2:24:50.160 --> 2:24:53.920]  america's founded on not trusting the government keeping it small
[2:24:53.920 --> 2:24:57.920]  that's what made us great here you come and i come in others and ron paul with
[2:24:57.920 --> 2:25:01.200]  basic common sense and the bad guys run around
[2:25:01.200 --> 2:25:04.640]  calling themselves the arbiters brainwashing police brainwashing
[2:25:04.640 --> 2:25:08.320]  military they don't like it that a well-spoken guy who's been successful
[2:25:08.320 --> 2:25:13.200]  like you at the supreme court who's credible comes up with real information
[2:25:13.200 --> 2:25:16.640]  and that now they've gotten into government and if illegitimately use it
[2:25:16.640 --> 2:25:19.760]  to take power you're going back to the original constitution
[2:25:19.760 --> 2:25:24.640]  and key positions like sheriff right and a certain extent police chief as well
[2:25:24.640 --> 2:25:28.800]  but nothing like sheriff it's elected right again elected key word the people
[2:25:28.800 --> 2:25:32.960]  and saying checkmate to the power grab and they
[2:25:32.960 --> 2:25:37.840]  don't like this idea of conservatives constitutionalist
[2:25:37.840 --> 2:25:41.680]  running for sheriffs converting sheriffs so we left off with
[2:25:41.680 --> 2:25:45.040]  the electricity in the room sheriffs coming up that went there because their
[2:25:45.040 --> 2:25:48.160]  constituents asked them to go see i came with an open mind but
[2:25:48.160 --> 2:25:51.920]  i'm sold now just on the common sense go ahead
[2:25:51.920 --> 2:25:55.520]  well and that happened throughout the day alex and i really wished you
[2:25:55.520 --> 2:25:59.920]  you could have been there everybody that donated we would have loved to have had
[2:25:59.920 --> 2:26:03.920]  them there and it was so powerful and we've we had
[2:26:03.920 --> 2:26:06.640]  comments like this from sheriffs all day long and
[2:26:06.640 --> 2:26:10.800]  another sheriff from organ after the lunch break came up and said
[2:26:10.800 --> 2:26:14.160]  boy some of the sheriffs in organ told me not to come to this because it was
[2:26:14.160 --> 2:26:17.120]  too radical there's nothing radical about this
[2:26:17.120 --> 2:26:21.680]  it's just a constitution and again another testimonial about what we were
[2:26:21.680 --> 2:26:25.680]  really doing there and then right after the break
[2:26:25.680 --> 2:26:30.640]  we had joe banister speak and of course you know what he speaks about the irs and
[2:26:30.640 --> 2:26:36.160]  the subversive a subterfuge of the irs and then we had your friend in mind
[2:26:36.160 --> 2:26:40.560]  larry prat and he spoke about the second amendment and of course the attacks
[2:26:40.560 --> 2:26:45.040]  of our own government towards the second amendment our right to keep bare arms
[2:26:45.040 --> 2:26:49.040]  and of course he talked about fast and furious and you just spoke about this
[2:26:49.040 --> 2:26:52.400]  as well and at the intent of the fast and furious
[2:26:52.400 --> 2:26:56.480]  project was a backdoor approach to create more gun control in this
[2:26:56.480 --> 2:27:01.040]  country and blame arizona gun shows and gun shops on the
[2:27:01.040 --> 2:27:06.880]  infiltration of firearms to mexican cartels in actuality this was the batf
[2:27:06.880 --> 2:27:10.880]  and this was a murder and one of the biggest conspiracies
[2:27:10.880 --> 2:27:14.960]  in the history of our country and probably the most horrific conspiracy
[2:27:14.960 --> 2:27:18.800]  by our own government since the assassination of jfk
[2:27:18.800 --> 2:27:22.560]  and so now we're looking at all of these issues as we present
[2:27:22.560 --> 2:27:26.320]  the truth to all these sheriffs and in the afternoon
[2:27:26.320 --> 2:27:32.880]  what did we do we had sheriffs speaking current employed constitutional
[2:27:32.880 --> 2:27:37.600]  sheriffs and and i have to tell you sheriff brad rogers from indiana
[2:27:37.600 --> 2:27:42.640]  who actually stood against the fda going after one of the amish farmers in
[2:27:42.640 --> 2:27:46.240]  his county and the the remarkable thing about this
[2:27:46.240 --> 2:27:49.040]  incident with david hostetler the amish farmer
[2:27:49.040 --> 2:27:53.600]  was that he had already passed every inspection the fda threw at him
[2:27:53.600 --> 2:27:58.480]  his place was just fine it was all up to code it was very clean no problems
[2:27:58.480 --> 2:28:02.960]  and they still kept after him and they in fact had him going before
[2:28:02.960 --> 2:28:09.120]  a grand jury in detroit and finally hostetler called us
[2:28:09.120 --> 2:28:13.520]  yeah he called his sheriff and said i'm actually getting tired of this now
[2:28:13.520 --> 2:28:17.680]  i've done everything they asked me to do i've let him on my property even though
[2:28:17.680 --> 2:28:20.000]  they had no probable cause or warrants he says
[2:28:20.000 --> 2:28:24.640]  i don't want him here anymore so what did brad rogers do he told the fda
[2:28:24.640 --> 2:28:27.840]  don't come back they tried to come back and he said look
[2:28:27.840 --> 2:28:32.560]  i told you don't come back if you try to come on this man's property again
[2:28:32.560 --> 2:28:36.000]  i'm going to charge you with trespassing unless you have a warrant signed by a
[2:28:36.000 --> 2:28:40.960]  judge or probable cause guess who won sheriff brad rogers
[2:28:40.960 --> 2:28:44.880]  and so this was a we had brad rogers tell his story and
[2:28:44.880 --> 2:28:49.680]  what he's doing to be a constitutional sheriff in indiana and i have to tell you
[2:28:49.680 --> 2:28:54.160]  we had about eight sheriffs maybe nine from northern california
[2:28:54.160 --> 2:28:58.640]  attend this event i mean we had more sheriffs from california than we did
[2:28:58.640 --> 2:29:03.680]  montana or idaho or nevada uh or arizona or new
[2:29:03.680 --> 2:29:08.080]  mexico we have sheriffs standing in california now because they've seen just
[2:29:08.080 --> 2:29:11.040]  what you were alluding to earlier the abuses of government
[2:29:11.040 --> 2:29:15.200]  coming after people they're trying to destroy families and farms in
[2:29:15.200 --> 2:29:19.440]  in siskiu county california i would have to say one of the biggest
[2:29:19.440 --> 2:29:23.120]  home runs hit in the afternoon session was by
[2:29:23.120 --> 2:29:28.400]  sheriff john lopie he was absolutely amazing stay there stay there i want to
[2:29:28.400 --> 2:29:31.360]  hear about that sheriff when we come back this is such good news
[2:29:31.360 --> 2:29:34.400]  this is why the globalists are so afraid they do not want us to make the
[2:29:34.400 --> 2:29:38.080]  sheriffs and police and others our friends and realize
[2:29:38.080 --> 2:29:41.680]  they're americans like us we've got to stick together
[2:29:41.680 --> 2:29:45.440]  and the bill of rights and constitution is all of our shields
[2:29:45.440 --> 2:29:49.600]  and they're so scared that we're starting to exercise our constitutional
[2:29:49.600 --> 2:29:54.400]  authority we're right back the empires on the run

[2:33:34.000 --> 2:33:38.400]  this is victory this is the smell the taste the look of it
[2:33:38.400 --> 2:33:42.000]  people that supported share of mac and helped finance getting over 100
[2:33:42.000 --> 2:33:46.480]  sheriffs uh to that event so that they could hear the truth and the fact that
[2:33:46.480 --> 2:33:50.400]  they're going to have more events the fact that it was a success
[2:33:50.400 --> 2:33:54.960]  this is something that spells the end of the new world order if it catches on
[2:33:54.960 --> 2:33:57.200]  and that's why the mainstream corporate
[2:33:57.200 --> 2:34:02.080]  trader media is so angry and so scared of this we the people aren't supposed to
[2:34:02.080 --> 2:34:05.280]  talk to our elected representatives we're not supposed to have them carry
[2:34:05.280 --> 2:34:08.880]  out the law and bill of rights and constitution we're just supposed to
[2:34:08.880 --> 2:34:13.360]  let the fed set up threat fusion centers and get rid of any jurisdiction
[2:34:13.360 --> 2:34:17.360]  no we're here to enforce the law and it scares
[2:34:17.360 --> 2:34:21.200]  the system to death yeah that when you've got the epa
[2:34:21.200 --> 2:34:24.640]  harassing amish while our borders are wide open
[2:34:24.640 --> 2:34:28.480]  and the amish are nice and say come on to our property over and over again
[2:34:28.480 --> 2:34:31.680]  and the government treats them like trash i mean i've seen reports where
[2:34:31.680 --> 2:34:34.960]  people pick their own potatoes and the feds learn they're eating them and
[2:34:34.960 --> 2:34:37.040]  show up make them throw them away i mean
[2:34:37.040 --> 2:34:40.720]  folks it's getting crazy because it's meant to be crazy
[2:34:40.720 --> 2:34:43.840]  stalling didn't let people grow their own food
[2:34:43.840 --> 2:34:47.040]  mal that's when they killed 60 plus million people wouldn't let all the
[2:34:47.040 --> 2:34:51.040]  farmers have their own farms anymore they all they want big mega farms they
[2:34:51.040 --> 2:34:55.200]  can control food as a weapon jenna 21 is this globalist
[2:34:55.200 --> 2:34:59.280]  corporate fascist on top but a communist system for us
[2:34:59.280 --> 2:35:02.640]  it's here you didn't think you'd have government health care it's here

[2:35:15.280 --> 2:35:17.920]  federal government and the shield is enforcing the
[2:35:17.920 --> 2:35:20.720]  constitution against them but they're like don't be radical
[2:35:20.720 --> 2:35:24.160]  don't enforce the constitution on us now go through some more of the sheriffs
[2:35:24.160 --> 2:35:26.960]  and what they're doing the actual the current serving sheriffs that were
[2:35:26.960 --> 2:35:29.280]  there who were who who who spoke
[2:35:29.280 --> 2:35:33.120]  he had over a hundred you know active sheriffs your current sheriffs there but
[2:35:33.120 --> 2:35:36.400]  but but some of the folks that spoke you got up to one who's really having
[2:35:36.400 --> 2:35:39.840]  victories against tyranny and your example of standing up for the feds
[2:35:39.840 --> 2:35:44.400]  is now spreading like wildfire and we're rediscovering
[2:35:44.400 --> 2:35:49.120]  good old-fashioned american law and common sense sheriff mac
[2:35:49.120 --> 2:35:53.200]  yeah it is alex and thanks uh and and you pegged it right on the nose
[2:35:53.200 --> 2:35:56.800]  this was the good news this is really good news
[2:35:56.800 --> 2:36:01.600]  and this is sheriffs simply standing all across the country so
[2:36:01.600 --> 2:36:05.280]  the the other good news that you already know also is that i'm running for
[2:36:05.280 --> 2:36:08.880]  united states congress here in texas and and so
[2:36:08.880 --> 2:36:12.480]  if anybody would like to get on board with any of this you can still get
[2:36:12.480 --> 2:36:16.800]  involved with the sheriff project go to county sheriff project org

[2:36:21.040 --> 2:36:24.320]  we are planning another one and we're trying to go east with this because
[2:36:24.320 --> 2:36:27.520]  they're really trying to destroy the office of sheriff
[2:36:27.520 --> 2:36:32.560]  in the east in particular delaware they've already voted the sheriff out
[2:36:32.560 --> 2:36:36.080]  10 years ago in connecticut there's no more sheriffs in connecticut
[2:36:36.080 --> 2:36:39.760]  now they're trying to do the same in delaware and massachusetts
[2:36:39.760 --> 2:36:43.920]  and maryland road island and now pennsylvania it's starting to happen
[2:36:43.920 --> 2:36:48.560]  there why is it that they're such an attack on the office of sheriff but
[2:36:48.560 --> 2:36:52.080]  they're not going after the chiefs of police they're not going after the
[2:36:52.080 --> 2:36:55.360]  state police they're not going after the highway patrol
[2:36:55.360 --> 2:36:58.560]  they're going after the office of sheriff which has been in existence for
[2:36:58.560 --> 2:37:04.320]  over a thousand years why now why why this why this movement to attack
[2:37:04.320 --> 2:37:08.640]  the power and authority of the sheriff or to destroy the office all together
[2:37:08.640 --> 2:37:11.840]  we know what the answer is they're afraid of the sheriffs
[2:37:11.840 --> 2:37:15.920]  and when sheriffs wake up and know what their real duty is to protect people
[2:37:15.920 --> 2:37:19.600]  from tyrannical government there's the solution
[2:37:19.600 --> 2:37:22.960]  and alex i have to tell you also in the afternoon session
[2:37:22.960 --> 2:37:29.680]  we had another huge solution it was county commissioner
[2:37:29.680 --> 2:37:34.480]  peggy littleton and you and your audience can see these videos at county
[2:37:34.480 --> 2:37:38.720]  sheriff project dot org uh and there's also a youtube channel
[2:37:38.720 --> 2:37:42.480]  i think it's uh youtube.com forward and by the way that's a
[2:37:42.480 --> 2:37:46.000]  great idea go to the website get the youtube's that are posted
[2:37:46.000 --> 2:37:50.320]  and and send them to your sheriff and send them over and over again
[2:37:50.320 --> 2:37:54.400]  because even if they can't go to these events the media can be seen by every
[2:37:54.400 --> 2:37:56.960]  sheriff in the country and that's a mission in fact i'm going to ask
[2:37:56.960 --> 2:38:01.920]  curtain immo to do a write-up today or tomorrow on on this interview posting
[2:38:01.920 --> 2:38:05.680]  this and then under it links and and and some of those videos
[2:38:05.680 --> 2:38:09.920]  you know operation you know warren the sheriff because as you said it's over a
[2:38:09.920 --> 2:38:14.400]  thousand-year-old institution and and and they wouldn't be attacking it
[2:38:14.400 --> 2:38:17.360]  like they're attacking the constitution look at the new york times
[2:38:17.360 --> 2:38:21.360]  seeing in time magazine all saying get rid of the constitution
[2:38:21.360 --> 2:38:24.400]  get rid of the sheriff they want those last links
[2:38:24.400 --> 2:38:28.240]  because they know anytime we can wake up and say we have the authority
[2:38:28.240 --> 2:38:32.480]  you foreign unrun banks you just can't come in here and take over
[2:38:32.480 --> 2:38:36.240]  you're a bunch of criminals and we need to get aggressive and call them out in
[2:38:36.240 --> 2:38:38.480]  fact did did you tell the story though the sheriff
[2:38:38.480 --> 2:38:41.760]  as we went to break that uh i mean some more of those stories you were going to
[2:38:41.760 --> 2:38:45.760]  tell about some of the other sheriffs as well well the the one i really like too
[2:38:45.760 --> 2:38:49.520]  was peggy little littleton the county commissioners standing up with her
[2:38:49.520 --> 2:38:53.040]  sheriff so they both did a presentation together
[2:38:53.040 --> 2:38:56.640]  and alex this is going to knock you back out of your chair so hold on
[2:38:56.640 --> 2:39:02.240]  this was a county commissioner standing with her sheriff county sheriff
[2:39:02.240 --> 2:39:06.560]  telling how they've been working on uh nullifying
[2:39:06.560 --> 2:39:12.160]  the ndaa they've actually worked on that together now let me tell you
[2:39:12.160 --> 2:39:16.800]  in my book it it actually gives this in the magic of gun control my new book
[2:39:16.800 --> 2:39:19.680]  it actually gives this as an equation in the book
[2:39:19.680 --> 2:39:26.800]  a constitutional county commissioner plus a constitutional county sheriff
[2:39:26.800 --> 2:39:31.840]  equals american liberty you put those two together working hand in hand like
[2:39:31.840 --> 2:39:35.360]  peggy littleton and sheriff makita are they got up and did their
[2:39:35.360 --> 2:39:38.880]  presentation again you can see this on my website
[2:39:38.880 --> 2:39:42.960]  and at the same time help donate for our next convention that we're going to
[2:39:42.960 --> 2:39:47.200]  have hopefully out near delaware so that we can make the east
[2:39:47.200 --> 2:39:51.440]  understand and the people out there understand the threat that's happening
[2:39:51.440 --> 2:39:54.640]  from our own government and from their own governments
[2:39:54.640 --> 2:39:59.200]  towards the office of the sheriff and how badly you have got to get involved
[2:39:59.200 --> 2:40:03.520]  in protecting the office of sheriff so you can donate at county sheriff
[2:40:03.520 --> 2:40:09.120]  uh project county sheriff project org and you can also get these videos
[2:40:09.120 --> 2:40:12.880]  and then i'm going to be marketing very soon now and our
[2:40:12.880 --> 2:40:17.200]  highlight of this entire convention and this convention lasted all day long
[2:40:17.200 --> 2:40:21.120]  it started at 8 30 in the morning and went to 9 30 at night
[2:40:21.120 --> 2:40:23.840]  these sheriffs really dedicated themselves to it
[2:40:23.840 --> 2:40:26.960]  we actually took a group photo and that's out there as well
[2:40:26.960 --> 2:40:31.360]  we had these sheriffs standing together taking this picture proudly in uniform
[2:40:31.360 --> 2:40:34.480]  we are the sheriff we are the constitutional sheriff standing
[2:40:34.480 --> 2:40:38.640]  together united and well the system is doing
[2:40:38.640 --> 2:40:41.440]  it's wonderful the system is doing everything they can to keep we the
[2:40:41.440 --> 2:40:45.440]  people from engaging with our elected representatives that we've elected
[2:40:45.440 --> 2:40:49.200]  and and i was just looking at an example of when you were
[2:40:49.200 --> 2:40:54.000]  supposed to speak in the past uh at different
[2:40:54.000 --> 2:40:57.840]  sheriff's associations you've spoken in many the southern property law center
[2:40:57.840 --> 2:41:01.440]  adl and others run in there as the little gatekeepers
[2:41:01.440 --> 2:41:04.480]  in the case of adl working for a foreign government publicly
[2:41:04.480 --> 2:41:08.560]  and say that do not have sheriffs mac he's a terrible person who
[2:41:08.560 --> 2:41:11.680]  was praised by justice khalia and won this big case and
[2:41:11.680 --> 2:41:15.120]  has been all over national television you know don't you dare have him come
[2:41:15.120 --> 2:41:18.480]  speak i saw a case a few years ago mississippi sheriff's association
[2:41:18.480 --> 2:41:22.560]  cancel sheriff mac speech people can also contact the different
[2:41:22.560 --> 2:41:26.480]  sheriff's associations and and tell them have sheriff mac come speak
[2:41:26.480 --> 2:41:30.560]  because you know you wear a suit and a tie you're well spoken you're a gentile
[2:41:30.560 --> 2:41:33.840]  handsome fellow you have the constitution on your side
[2:41:33.840 --> 2:41:39.200]  they hate that image and it scares them here's a real american here's a real
[2:41:39.200 --> 2:41:42.960]  sheriff here's a real constitutionalist here's a guy with a great record never
[2:41:42.960 --> 2:41:47.120]  even had to pull his firearm out in violence let's lie about him and say
[2:41:47.120 --> 2:41:50.480]  he wants to kill cops uh and i know you're suing him now
[2:41:50.480 --> 2:41:54.480]  it's time to turn the tide and say listen you foreign intelligence operations
[2:41:54.480 --> 2:41:58.480]  listen you globalist operations southern property law center why'd you have people
[2:41:58.480 --> 2:42:01.040]  inside elohim city
[2:42:01.040 --> 2:42:04.400]  why'd that come out in different lawsuits and the documents that have been
[2:42:04.400 --> 2:42:07.680]  released let's get on the offensive with these rats
[2:42:07.680 --> 2:42:12.320]  like you're doing so so let's speak about the southern slimes center
[2:42:12.320 --> 2:42:15.760]  and what they did to you and what they've done to well they've done stuff to me as
[2:42:15.760 --> 2:42:19.680]  well a very dangerous organization linked up with
[2:42:19.680 --> 2:42:22.800]  george soros of course and media matters and the obama
[2:42:22.800 --> 2:42:28.080]  administration obama now telling preachers get people to vote for me
[2:42:28.080 --> 2:42:32.320]  turn your churches into campaign operations i played that clip last hour
[2:42:32.320 --> 2:42:35.600]  this is while they tell other churches that are libertarian or constitutional
[2:42:35.600 --> 2:42:39.280]  or conservative you'll be arrested if you talk about politics when
[2:42:39.280 --> 2:42:42.960]  churches can talk about politics you just can't have the president turning it
[2:42:42.960 --> 2:42:46.240]  into an official campaign office i mean that's incredible
[2:42:46.240 --> 2:42:50.560]  they're saying you don't have speech but we're going to take them over for obama
[2:42:50.560 --> 2:42:55.440]  i mean they are the enemies of america there's no debating it anymore folks
[2:42:55.440 --> 2:42:59.040]  everything we talked about 20 years ago is coming true
[2:42:59.040 --> 2:43:02.000]  everything mac talked about 20 years ago is coming true
[2:43:02.000 --> 2:43:05.920]  we deserve a pat on the back and we're getting that and the system scared so
[2:43:05.920 --> 2:43:08.880]  so let's get into the southern slimes center
[2:43:08.880 --> 2:43:12.880]  and other things that are happening that's one of my least favorite subjects
[2:43:12.880 --> 2:43:16.320]  of course is the southern poverty slime center but that's what they are
[2:43:16.320 --> 2:43:19.200]  there are a bunch of liars mark potock is a liar
[2:43:19.200 --> 2:43:23.040]  and i've i've they've been attacking me ever since
[2:43:23.040 --> 2:43:26.880]  i filed my lawsuit against the federal government in 1994
[2:43:26.880 --> 2:43:30.400]  and they've been lying about me and lying about me and they've been lying
[2:43:30.400 --> 2:43:32.800]  about you and they've been lying about ron paul and
[2:43:32.800 --> 2:43:36.720]  judging polotono and i'm wondering if uh if that's
[2:43:36.720 --> 2:43:41.040]  what was part of the reason behind judging polotono getting fired
[2:43:41.040 --> 2:43:44.960]  of course another great man oh no that's admitted the
[2:43:44.960 --> 2:43:50.480]  you have those guys linked up uh with uh soros's group media matters the
[2:43:50.480 --> 2:43:55.040]  media matters wrote letters saying fire him oh okay i mean and who are these
[2:43:55.040 --> 2:43:59.040]  people no one even visits their website it's an obama front group and everyone
[2:43:59.040 --> 2:44:03.280]  has to bow down to him i'm sorry go ahead well and and judge polotono's had
[2:44:03.280 --> 2:44:06.800]  me on uh his show six times in the last two years
[2:44:06.800 --> 2:44:10.720]  talking about these very same issues that you and i are talking about today
[2:44:10.720 --> 2:44:14.720]  and the southern poverty law center wouldn't i get to congress
[2:44:14.720 --> 2:44:18.000]  and i am running for congress and i'm a serious candidate i'm running and i'm
[2:44:18.000 --> 2:44:22.640]  going to replace this rhino republican known as lamar smith in district 21
[2:44:22.640 --> 2:44:26.080]  because he's been nothing but horrible you know what he said two nights ago i
[2:44:26.080 --> 2:44:28.640]  went and heard him speak i was in the audience
[2:44:28.640 --> 2:44:33.920]  they the one of the members in the audience asked him specifically
[2:44:33.920 --> 2:44:38.480]  what did you why did you vote for ndaa and what's wrong with nda and isn't an
[2:44:38.480 --> 2:44:41.280]  attack of american citizens and he says i quote
[2:44:41.280 --> 2:44:47.360]  i signed the ndaa happily and that's that's the guy i'm running against so
[2:44:47.360 --> 2:44:50.960]  again if you unbelievable him and obama yeah
[2:44:50.960 --> 2:44:57.440]  yeah and he exactly he increased the power uh to barack obama
[2:44:57.440 --> 2:45:00.640]  in the biggest power grab for a president since
[2:45:00.640 --> 2:45:04.480]  king george the third sent redcoats to america this is
[2:45:04.480 --> 2:45:08.240]  this is so out of line and well i mean i've been around him forever his
[2:45:08.240 --> 2:45:12.240]  district used to run up to austin he always talks a good game but his
[2:45:12.240 --> 2:45:16.400]  actions are power grabbing big government i hope you can replace smith
[2:45:16.400 --> 2:45:19.600]  that's a separate interview we're going to do but very exciting
[2:45:19.600 --> 2:45:23.200]  specifically though your lawsuit against the uh against poh talk tell folks
[2:45:23.200 --> 2:45:28.480]  what he did to you just to okay well uh you already alluded to part of it
[2:45:28.480 --> 2:45:33.200]  but they've gone after me for years and and uh lying about me being a racist and
[2:45:33.200 --> 2:45:36.480]  a bigot and all these other things that are absolutely not true they just make
[2:45:36.480 --> 2:45:39.760]  it up they just make it up as they go along yeah and
[2:45:39.760 --> 2:45:45.200]  so finally when he did this one um i i actually uh got a hold of him he had a
[2:45:45.200 --> 2:45:48.240]  reporter call me and i said why should i talk to you
[2:45:48.240 --> 2:45:53.360]  you guys have never called me before you lie about me all the time
[2:45:53.360 --> 2:45:58.960]  this is the first time in in 16 years that you've ever had anybody call me
[2:45:58.960 --> 2:46:03.520]  to verify anything that you have lied about me on and he says well when have
[2:46:03.520 --> 2:46:07.200]  we lied about you and i said well the most recently is in your stupid
[2:46:07.200 --> 2:46:11.040]  magazine the intel report where you said that i advocate violence against
[2:46:11.040 --> 2:46:14.320]  federal agents i said i've never said that in my life
[2:46:14.320 --> 2:46:18.640]  and yet you guys quote me is saying that this is the worst thing
[2:46:18.640 --> 2:46:22.960]  of all the people that you're attacking that i'm the worst one
[2:46:22.960 --> 2:46:27.600]  and uh so i said the mark poh talk got on the phone after that and he was
[2:46:27.600 --> 2:46:31.600]  emailing me and calling me and emailing me and calling me and i said look
[2:46:31.600 --> 2:46:35.360]  um you're either going to settle this with me and we'll take care of this as
[2:46:35.360 --> 2:46:39.040]  gentlemen uh or i'm going to sue you and they would not have
[2:46:39.040 --> 2:46:42.240]  anything to do with me and up front or honest about it so i sued him
[2:46:42.240 --> 2:46:46.320]  and uh they did print a retraction they came back to me later
[2:46:46.320 --> 2:46:50.640]  and they said you're right you didn't say that what we said you said
[2:46:50.640 --> 2:46:55.920]  it was just a mistake on the transcription so you know darn well it
[2:46:55.920 --> 2:47:00.160]  wasn't a mistake i told him that i'm not telling you that alex i'm i told that
[2:47:00.160 --> 2:47:03.920]  to mark poh talk i said you know darn well it was not a mistake
[2:47:03.920 --> 2:47:08.240]  well look and they you they have caused me a lot of damage just like you said
[2:47:08.240 --> 2:47:12.960]  and uh so um other sheriffs have been well no that's what they used to get
[2:47:12.960 --> 2:47:15.360]  you cancelled speaking to law enforcement groups
[2:47:15.360 --> 2:47:18.800]  oh is they said listen we all know they're writing the mayak and homeland's
[2:47:18.800 --> 2:47:21.360]  courier reports with the adl it's admitted they do
[2:47:21.360 --> 2:47:24.800]  and when you get the internal stuff that we've broken from good police
[2:47:24.800 --> 2:47:28.160]  and sheriffs and and federal marshals and state police that have sent us these
[2:47:28.160 --> 2:47:31.280]  things over the years right it's trying to induce this state of
[2:47:31.280 --> 2:47:36.560]  of craziness do they wear blue jeans is the ron paul stickers cell phones
[2:47:36.560 --> 2:47:40.160]  goggles mask recording equipment do they pay cash for coffee
[2:47:40.160 --> 2:47:43.760]  who doesn't pay cash for coffee when it's two dollars or a dollar fifty
[2:47:43.760 --> 2:47:48.400]  i mean i it's crazy i'll take this is going on and it's
[2:47:48.400 --> 2:47:52.880]  i'll pick exactly but let me tell you one other thing it's total paranoia is
[2:47:52.880 --> 2:47:56.880]  what they're trying to induce where we don't trust each other and the police
[2:47:56.880 --> 2:48:00.080]  don't trust the citizens and it's not against them but we trust janet
[2:48:00.080 --> 2:48:03.200]  depolitano who's shipping guns into mexico right
[2:48:03.200 --> 2:48:07.200]  exactly and i will tell you that when i get to congress
[2:48:07.200 --> 2:48:11.200]  that i'm going to follow the money trail with with the southern public law
[2:48:11.200 --> 2:48:14.400]  center i'm going to see how much money from the fbi
[2:48:14.400 --> 2:48:18.720]  cia and other federal law enforcement agencies has been
[2:48:18.720 --> 2:48:24.640]  uh shuttled over to a smuggled i should say over to southern public law
[2:48:24.640 --> 2:48:27.920]  center i know they get a lot of contracts with the federal government
[2:48:27.920 --> 2:48:31.040]  i want to know how much acorn type money has gone
[2:48:31.040 --> 2:48:34.640]  to the southern public law center i want to see what the relationship is there
[2:48:34.640 --> 2:48:37.600]  i want to stop all that funding just like they've done
[2:48:37.600 --> 2:48:41.120]  to uh planned parenthood and acorn and other groups
[2:48:41.120 --> 2:48:45.040]  i know darn well they get federal money i want it publicized how much
[2:48:45.040 --> 2:48:49.120]  and how much support our money is giving them i use they use our money
[2:48:49.120 --> 2:48:53.040]  against us and it's time it stops these slugs get our money
[2:48:53.040 --> 2:48:57.600]  and then try to tell people we're bad for our first amendment right on our money
[2:48:57.600 --> 2:49:00.800]  trying to silence us yeah and they've done nothing to
[2:49:00.800 --> 2:49:05.760]  to combat what the abuses of government are they've never stood against
[2:49:05.760 --> 2:49:10.080]  destroying farms and families and the amish or anybody else
[2:49:10.080 --> 2:49:13.760]  but they know they always demonize well and now they're even demonizing the
[2:49:13.760 --> 2:49:16.720]  amish i mean now they're all guided but let's expand on this
[2:49:16.720 --> 2:49:20.000]  you you don't file lawsuits to lose i mean you want the supreme court even
[2:49:20.000 --> 2:49:22.800]  successful right so you looked at this and i know it's only been a few months
[2:49:22.800 --> 2:49:25.840]  and these things move slow but right when will we get some updates
[2:49:25.840 --> 2:49:28.640]  i guess i guess they've either got a response settle
[2:49:28.640 --> 2:49:32.800]  or they're gonna then start being the the discovery oh that's going to be fun
[2:49:32.800 --> 2:49:37.200]  i know discovery will be fun and we're just getting now into discovery
[2:49:37.200 --> 2:49:42.640]  issues we're right now fighting fighting their motion to dismiss
[2:49:42.640 --> 2:49:46.080]  on some ridiculous technicalities but their lawyers are shrewd you know darn
[2:49:46.080 --> 2:49:51.120]  well they have a bunch of lawyers who are very seasoned lawyers very expensive
[2:49:51.120 --> 2:49:54.960]  lawyers the their goal is they they're the justice department
[2:49:54.960 --> 2:49:58.640]  i mean they are the justice department yeah those types i mean it's come out
[2:49:58.640 --> 2:50:02.000]  that they are basically the justice department just has a quasi
[2:50:02.000 --> 2:50:05.040]  private group it's the justice department right it's like the communist
[2:50:05.040 --> 2:50:07.840]  element of the justice department so that's where we are at this point we're
[2:50:07.840 --> 2:50:11.600]  fighting that one their lawyer just met with my
[2:50:11.600 --> 2:50:14.960]  lawyer and let me tell you another their plan
[2:50:14.960 --> 2:50:18.800]  is to keep trying every technicality that they can so that they can
[2:50:18.800 --> 2:50:22.720]  hurt us financially on this and that we won't be able to continue financially
[2:50:22.720 --> 2:50:25.520]  let me guarantee you alex that's not going to happen
[2:50:25.520 --> 2:50:29.440]  okay i've already talked to my look look when it comes to libel slander and
[2:50:29.440 --> 2:50:32.640]  defamation it doesn't matter if they say you're a public
[2:50:32.640 --> 2:50:36.240]  figure it doesn't matter if they say they're a media outlet when you start
[2:50:36.240 --> 2:50:40.720]  saying that people are saying kill cops that is dangerous that goes in
[2:50:40.720 --> 2:50:44.080]  databases as you know exactly that puts me under investigation
[2:50:44.080 --> 2:50:46.800]  from the fbi or federal agencies now because what
[2:50:46.800 --> 2:50:50.400]  southern poverty law center has said they should know if they're gonna lose
[2:50:50.400 --> 2:50:53.920]  you cannot do that that's the worst thing you can say about somebody
[2:50:53.920 --> 2:50:59.040]  is that you're calling for killing people right i mean it and unbelievable
[2:50:59.040 --> 2:51:03.360]  we'll be right back stay there um i've seen the ungevity products work for

[2:54:27.200 --> 2:54:31.920]  obama plays race card calls on churches to support campaign
[2:54:31.920 --> 2:54:38.480]  in a psa so now government psas are campaign ads on race and then say use
[2:54:38.480 --> 2:54:42.320]  the churches to get me elected with him in the oval office or what looks like
[2:54:42.320 --> 2:54:45.040]  the oval office you're not supposed to do that
[2:54:45.040 --> 2:54:48.560]  uh they commit any crimes they want do whatever they want
[2:54:48.560 --> 2:54:52.320]  those of us that stand up and say we just want america back we just want
[2:54:52.320 --> 2:54:56.480]  freedom oh you're evil you're a terrorist you're bad
[2:54:56.480 --> 2:55:00.960]  years ago sheriff mac after you'd won your case i'm running for sheriff again
[2:55:00.960 --> 2:55:04.960]  what you got visited by the fbi with warrants didn't you
[2:55:04.960 --> 2:55:09.920]  a little fishing expedition they tried to put a former treasury agent
[2:55:09.920 --> 2:55:13.440]  in jail who was exposing that the irs was really collecting money for the
[2:55:13.440 --> 2:55:17.360]  private fellow reserve all that's true whatever happened with
[2:55:17.360 --> 2:55:19.920]  that case when they were politically going after you
[2:55:19.920 --> 2:55:23.360]  well it was three days before my uh election
[2:55:23.360 --> 2:55:26.960]  i actually moved to utah to run for county sheriff there and three days
[2:55:26.960 --> 2:55:30.320]  before the election the fbi and irs raid my office
[2:55:30.320 --> 2:55:33.840]  uh it was actually aimed at a guy that i would i had a contract with and
[2:55:33.840 --> 2:55:36.800]  with that contract he provided me an office but
[2:55:36.800 --> 2:55:40.800]  um it was all aimed at him but they somehow thought they should put my name
[2:55:40.800 --> 2:55:44.960]  on their search warrant but there was no charges levied against and then that
[2:55:44.960 --> 2:55:48.080]  was put in the news because you were ahead in the polls
[2:55:48.080 --> 2:55:53.280]  of course to to to to make you lose yeah i was i already won the convention now
[2:55:53.280 --> 2:55:56.640]  they have a process there where you kind of meet like the national convention
[2:55:56.640 --> 2:55:59.440]  here with republicans when they nominate their guy well
[2:55:59.440 --> 2:56:03.120]  it was a utah county convention and i won that two to one
[2:56:03.120 --> 2:56:07.520]  two to one over the incumbent uh and one of his uh lieutenants that was also
[2:56:07.520 --> 2:56:10.960]  running against him and uh so yeah i almost won the whole
[2:56:10.960 --> 2:56:15.120]  thing right then and there and so they had to find a way to go after me and
[2:56:15.120 --> 2:56:19.600]  you know if you if somebody else had come off to me off the street at one of
[2:56:19.600 --> 2:56:22.960]  my events and said hey the fbi and iris raided my
[2:56:22.960 --> 2:56:26.080]  office while i was running for off i would have never believed it alex i'm
[2:56:26.080 --> 2:56:29.520]  not i'm not kidding it was too that's just too far out there for me but it
[2:56:29.520 --> 2:56:33.360]  actually happened to me in fact my wife is here who would next to me and she
[2:56:33.360 --> 2:56:36.800]  was uh she was there at the time she was the receptionist
[2:56:36.800 --> 2:56:42.960]  yeah so anyway it was a very who would have believed
[2:56:42.960 --> 2:56:45.360]  but but i mean who would have believed well maybe we can do a little bit of
[2:56:45.360 --> 2:56:48.160]  overdrive and talk to your wife on air here yeah
[2:56:48.160 --> 2:56:52.800]  but uh who who would have believed a sheriff max
[2:56:52.800 --> 2:56:57.280]  that that they'd be shipping guns into mexico and then to use it to blame the
[2:56:57.280 --> 2:57:00.080]  second amendment and in those federal cases that the
[2:57:00.080 --> 2:57:04.240]  media won't cover it's also drug dealing what do you make of obama
[2:57:04.240 --> 2:57:07.440]  i don't know if you've seen this video but it's on info wars dot com putting
[2:57:07.440 --> 2:57:11.600]  out what looks like an oval office address but it's really a campaign ad
[2:57:11.600 --> 2:57:15.120]  telling people get get your church to vote for me
[2:57:15.120 --> 2:57:19.120]  use your church as a campaign office i mean it's unbelievable
[2:57:19.120 --> 2:57:23.600]  well isn't that astonishing that uh he's forcing these churches to violate
[2:57:23.600 --> 2:57:29.200]  their own 501c3 charitable uh tax exempts at iris tax exemption
[2:57:29.200 --> 2:57:32.880]  so he's actually violating the law with them he's actually encouraging them to
[2:57:32.880 --> 2:57:35.920]  violate the law there was a stupid law in the first place
[2:57:35.920 --> 2:57:40.240]  no church should be 501c3 that is an obvious violation of the first
[2:57:40.240 --> 2:57:43.280]  amendment but uh it's obvious that this administration
[2:57:43.280 --> 2:57:47.040]  obama doesn't care about the first amendment with this recent
[2:57:47.040 --> 2:57:50.800]  it's all selective of course it is it whatever helps him
[2:57:50.800 --> 2:57:56.800]  exactly and whatever maintains his power over the american people so that
[2:57:56.800 --> 2:58:00.800]  they can continue this affront known as agenda 21
[2:58:00.800 --> 2:58:04.560]  and ndaa and how is it that any republican
[2:58:04.560 --> 2:58:08.080]  in the right mind in washington would allow president obama
[2:58:08.080 --> 2:58:11.360]  the authority to use the military against american citizens
[2:58:11.360 --> 2:58:17.120]  on american soil wow that actually happened well that was a big that was a
[2:58:17.120 --> 2:58:20.560]  big wake-up call i mean india is woken up so many people
[2:58:20.560 --> 2:58:23.920]  let's do a little bit of overdrive uh sometimes we do the fourth hour live
[2:58:23.920 --> 2:58:26.560]  sometimes we don't but sometimes it's the first hour reared but
[2:58:26.560 --> 2:58:29.040]  we're going to come back with sheriff richard mac and if your wife wants to
[2:58:29.040 --> 2:58:32.960]  pop in and say hi uh then that'd be great uh as well
[2:58:32.960 --> 2:58:36.800]  okay and of course he's he's he's old-fashioned folks he has a wife i know
[2:58:36.800 --> 2:58:40.160]  that's probably going to be illegal soon uh but we'll be right back in one
[2:58:40.160 --> 2:58:42.880]  minute i got a wife too i'm sorry i'm come on

[2:58:54.560 --> 2:58:58.640]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[2:58:58.640 --> 2:59:02.560]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[2:59:02.560 --> 2:59:06.000]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[2:59:06.000 --> 2:59:10.240]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[2:59:10.240 --> 2:59:13.840]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country
[2:59:13.840 --> 2:59:18.320]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[2:59:18.320 --> 2:59:22.160]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[2:59:22.160 --> 2:59:25.760]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power
[2:59:25.760 --> 2:59:29.680]  from weather-related onages number five a solar power generator provides

[2:59:57.920 --> 3:00:03.840]  broadcasting network network
[3:00:28.480 --> 3:00:36.000]  all right ladies and gentlemen sheriff richard mac is
[3:00:36.000 --> 3:00:40.720]  our guest and we are talking to him about the whole new world order system
[3:00:40.720 --> 3:00:43.200]  of course he's the sheriff that took it all the way to supreme court and got
[3:00:43.200 --> 3:00:46.800]  the brady bill overturned and he is now trying to organize
[3:00:46.800 --> 3:00:50.480]  sheriffs around the country to defend the constitution bill of rights and their
[3:00:50.480 --> 3:00:54.080]  state jurisdiction and not just let the feds come in and do whatever they want
[3:00:54.080 --> 3:00:57.120]  the feds are now announcing they're going to have cops for regular crime on
[3:00:57.120 --> 3:01:00.720]  the streets and they have tsa who aren't even sworn police
[3:01:00.720 --> 3:01:04.160]  commanding the police it's like oh you're a potbellied government
[3:01:04.160 --> 3:01:08.000]  idiot who isn't even sworn or trained you're now going to command everybody
[3:01:08.000 --> 3:01:11.840]  i mean i've seen it on the news where tsa is commanding the state police at
[3:01:11.840 --> 3:01:15.840]  checkpoints on the highway what do you make of the tsa power grab
[3:01:15.840 --> 3:01:19.760]  a and then b what do you make of the huge awakening to agenda 21
[3:01:19.760 --> 3:01:24.240]  that even the new york times bemoaned and panicked they admit the un's advising
[3:01:24.240 --> 3:01:28.720]  and taking over the land but they said the un's good we need them to run things
[3:01:28.720 --> 3:01:31.600]  see they don't deny the global government now sheriff mac
[3:01:31.600 --> 3:01:35.200]  now it's like well they need to run things extremist so we were extreme to
[3:01:35.200 --> 3:01:38.560]  say they were taking over it didn't exist now that it is though it's like well
[3:01:38.560 --> 3:01:42.480]  you should want the un to run things not the nasty sheriff
[3:01:42.480 --> 3:01:46.560]  well i was really proud of the state of texas for taking action against the tsa
[3:01:46.560 --> 3:01:49.840]  and then of course the tsa and the federal government made this
[3:01:49.840 --> 3:01:55.360]  a threat of making texas a no fly zone and so a lot of these wimps in the
[3:01:55.360 --> 3:02:01.040]  texas legislature backed off but the tsa is a another conditioning of americans
[3:02:01.040 --> 3:02:04.000]  and it's also the conditioning of the tsa employees
[3:02:04.000 --> 3:02:07.680]  i just follow orders i just do whatever i i have to
[3:02:07.680 --> 3:02:11.120]  the the video where the tsa is actually groping
[3:02:11.120 --> 3:02:16.480]  the six-year-old uh little girl that was the beginning of our presentation at
[3:02:16.480 --> 3:02:20.560]  the sheriff convention and and so we're showing those abuses
[3:02:20.560 --> 3:02:25.280]  over and over and then at the end we showed is it time yet
[3:02:25.280 --> 3:02:29.520]  and then it went right into our cspoa constitutional sheriff logo
[3:02:29.520 --> 3:02:32.880]  that shows a sheriff with a badge swearing
[3:02:32.880 --> 3:02:37.600]  um to uphold and defend the constitution taking his oath that shows that
[3:02:37.600 --> 3:02:42.800]  and so that that kind of conditioning uh is alarming because it's increased as
[3:02:42.800 --> 3:02:49.120]  such um uh a phenomenal pace that uh this is why
[3:02:49.120 --> 3:02:52.960]  a lot of sheriffs are waking up and a lot of americans are waking up
[3:02:52.960 --> 3:02:59.200]  and and i i do appreciate the abuse of brock obama being so acute that he has
[3:02:59.200 --> 3:03:02.960]  awakened so many people and including sheriffs
[3:03:02.960 --> 3:03:06.800]  i believe that's the reason we had about a hundred sheriffs at the convention
[3:03:06.800 --> 3:03:10.160]  i believe that's why we still have um a lot of
[3:03:10.160 --> 3:03:15.040]  interest in what we're doing and again please have your audience go to
[3:03:15.040 --> 3:03:19.040]  uh county sheriff project dot org you can see a lot of those
[3:03:19.040 --> 3:03:22.960]  videos there you can see some testimonials of people who are actually
[3:03:22.960 --> 3:03:27.200]  there and this again alex this is the good news today
[3:03:27.200 --> 3:03:31.280]  it was good news it is good news we're proceeding with this
[3:03:31.280 --> 3:03:35.520]  we're making this bigger better and faster and the event in las vegas
[3:03:35.520 --> 3:03:39.440]  proved that we can do this we raised the money for it
[3:03:39.440 --> 3:03:44.320]  we're still asking for help with that go again to countychefproject.org
[3:03:44.320 --> 3:03:48.400]  and again for my website for running for uh congress
[3:03:48.400 --> 3:03:53.440]  that's sheriff mack for congress.com
[3:03:53.440 --> 3:03:57.200]  well again instead of just complaining about the globalist the new world order
[3:03:57.200 --> 3:04:00.320]  all day we're taking action you're taking action
[3:04:00.320 --> 3:04:03.440]  ron paul is i am obviously a big part of it is
[3:04:03.440 --> 3:04:06.640]  exposing like the founding fathers of the committees of correspondence
[3:04:06.640 --> 3:04:09.760]  the crimes and activities of the globalists as you did at your conference
[3:04:09.760 --> 3:04:13.760]  but then taking action against them with solutions and that's what this radio
[3:04:13.760 --> 3:04:17.280]  show is there's a platform for people like you to bring in the solutions and
[3:04:17.280 --> 3:04:19.440]  the ideas and it's up to listeners and viewers
