[00:00.000 --> 00:20.000]  It's for Wars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:30.000 --> 00:59.000]  Just two weeks ago, and then another week ago, the puppet president promised we would not see any images that resembled the fall of Saigon in 1975.
[00:59.000 --> 01:03.000]  But maybe we should probably go to YouTube and type that in.
[01:03.000 --> 01:10.000]  Helicopter Airlift Saigon 1975 and then compare the two together.
[01:10.000 --> 01:13.000]  In fact, there it is on Twitter. They're basically identical.
[01:13.000 --> 01:29.000]  They're still using the Chinooks from Vietnam to do it. They still can't make a better helicopter design the 1950s. It goes 200 miles an hour and can pick people up off the side of a cliff or a mountain.
[01:29.000 --> 01:33.000]  Pretty amazing. And there are the images for TV viewers, radio listeners.
[01:33.000 --> 01:56.000]  It's all posted on infowars.com. People scrambling for dear life. After 20 years and $2 trillion spent to create this United Nations utopia of love and kindness and goodness, it's all been a giant fraud to get the opium.
[01:56.000 --> 02:05.000]  It's all been a giant scam to secure the country for China so they can get trillions of dollars in rare earth minerals out of the country.
[02:05.000 --> 02:12.000]  And now China is moving in to replace the United States as the new empire to take control, but they don't need to use any violence.
[02:12.000 --> 02:26.000]  They'll just simply buy off the Taliban. They're trying to blame President Trump for what has happened, but he had a completely different plan of withdrawal.
[02:26.000 --> 02:35.000]  This has been a panic withdrawal, almost as if they wanted this to happen on purpose.
[02:35.000 --> 02:44.000]  Helicopters are evacuating staff from the U.S. Embassy in Kabul as the Taliban entered the Afghan capital from all sides.
[02:44.000 --> 02:55.000]  Watch hundreds of U.S. citizens scramble aboard C-17 as Taliban ready to declare Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, which China has already recognized.
[02:55.000 --> 03:01.000]  Former CIA officer, the most infamous and devastating press conference ever held by an American president.
[03:01.000 --> 03:17.000]  Twenty years of war in Afghanistan has cost the U.S. taxpayer over $2.2 trillion, which of course was the plan, a giant cash machine of U.S. taxpayer money directly into globalist coffers.
[03:17.000 --> 03:20.000]  Again, you can watch the footage at infowars.com.
[03:20.000 --> 03:27.000]  U.S. choppers evacuate Kabul Embassy as Blinken defiantly rejects Vietnam pullout comparisons.
[03:27.000 --> 03:34.000]  Talk about gaslighting. The Afghan president has fled the country as the Taliban enter the capital.
[03:34.000 --> 03:44.000]  The Biden relaxes on vacation, while Saigon moment looms in Afghanistan, and it's all ready here.
[03:44.000 --> 03:53.000]  That's just some of the news we're going to be covering, like this important John Bound report that's coming up next segment.
[03:53.000 --> 04:00.000]  Afghanistan falls. Biden fails. That's coming up.
[04:00.000 --> 04:08.000]  But we've got some really big news other than this today, as important as this is, and as predictable as this was.
[04:08.000 --> 04:17.000]  I haven't said last year that if Trump wasn't careful, it could end up looking like the fall of Saigon in 1975.
[04:17.000 --> 04:25.000]  Because the whole thing was a mistake to ever go in there to begin with. Much less stay there. And to act like it's a victory for the Taliban to take over the place that they've been in control of,
[04:25.000 --> 04:28.000]  because they're from there for thousands of years, is also a misnomer.
[04:28.000 --> 04:34.000]  But this is really emblematic of a collapsing empire now turning inward on itself.
[04:34.000 --> 04:50.000]  Turns out, info wars trended yesterday and today on Twitter and other places, because NBC and others ran a headline, we'll cover when we first get back,
[04:50.000 --> 04:55.000]  saying that if you protest any form of COVID restriction, you are a terrorist.
[04:55.000 --> 05:00.000]  Well, that's in the official U.S. government policy, but now they're announcing it.
[05:00.000 --> 05:06.000]  So when I first started taking survival skills, basically I was 275 pounds overweight.
[05:06.000 --> 05:13.000]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe. I was barely holding onto a job, and I heard Dr. Group on your show, and I listened to it.
[05:13.000 --> 05:16.000]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield, the X1.
[05:16.000 --> 05:19.000]  And it worked pretty good. And then shortly thereafter, you came out with that.
[05:19.000 --> 05:23.000]  You had, you know, with the deep burdens, tourists, you know, and I got really excited about that, so I took it.
[05:23.000 --> 05:30.000]  And then in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[05:30.000 --> 05:33.000]  You know, I could think again, I could connect with people again.
[05:33.000 --> 05:39.000]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[05:39.000 --> 05:41.000]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[05:41.000 --> 05:47.000]  The one I like recently is knockout literally like if you want to sleep, just take it. It's amazing. It works.
[05:47.000 --> 05:53.000]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean. We have to break free of the globalist system.
[05:53.000 --> 05:56.000]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[05:56.000 --> 05:59.000]  Beautifully said, brother. I thank you so much for calling Godspeed.
[05:59.000 --> 06:02.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[06:30.000 --> 06:34.000]  It's Sunday, August 15th of the year.
[06:34.000 --> 06:37.000]  It's 2021.
[06:37.000 --> 06:46.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and I'm very blessed to be here with you live on air this evening, broadcasting worldwide.
[06:46.000 --> 06:58.000]  Now, let's go ahead and put on screen for everybody something that came from an NBC News program on NBC National Friday evening.
[06:58.000 --> 07:04.000]  Now, when this went out on the news, they also announced this, we have the video clip.
[07:04.000 --> 07:10.000]  People were pretty shocked because it is an extremely authoritarian statement.
[07:10.000 --> 07:14.000]  Then the left began to say on Twitter and Instagram that it wasn't true.
[07:14.000 --> 07:19.000]  And I've got those printouts here as well.
[07:19.000 --> 07:26.000]  And they said it can't be true because Alex Jones can't be right again. How could this be?
[07:26.000 --> 07:39.000]  And then I saw massive, massive numbers of tweets and comments just explode out saying Jones must be in the CIA.
[07:39.000 --> 07:43.000]  How did he know this? So we can put that back on screen please.
[07:43.000 --> 07:47.000]  For radio listeners, I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to read this for everybody.
[07:47.000 --> 08:03.000]  Potential terror threats, opposition to COVID measures, claims of election fraud, belief Trump can be reinstated, 9-11 anniversary and religious holidays.
[08:03.000 --> 08:09.000]  Now, where is there evidence that people that want to reinstate Trump or question the election are going to blow stuff up?
[08:09.000 --> 08:17.000]  And where is there evidence that people protesting masks that don't work and experimental vaccines that don't work and make people sick?
[08:17.000 --> 08:23.000]  Where is there evidence that we're terrorists, much less that we're the number one terror threat?
[08:23.000 --> 08:32.000]  So again, for all those new viewers and all those new listeners, let me show you where I got this.
[08:32.000 --> 08:36.000]  I didn't get it from the CIA. I didn't get it out of a crystal ball.
[08:36.000 --> 08:40.000]  I didn't learn about this from a fortune cookie.
[08:40.000 --> 08:53.000]  I learned about it two months ago when they issued the new official policy of the Biden administration, the National Strategy for Conducting Domestic Terrorism.
[08:53.000 --> 08:58.000]  The National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism.
[08:58.000 --> 09:07.000]  That's really what they're doing is conducting terrorism against us with the Chinese bio-weapon that their controllers released to take control of the United States.
[09:07.000 --> 09:14.000]  So this was put out in June and I covered it every day that I was on air since then.
[09:14.000 --> 09:19.000]  Every day. Every day. I'm on the air seven days a week now.
[09:19.000 --> 09:25.000]  Every show, I showed you this and I said, this is the holy grail of what's coming.
[09:25.000 --> 09:30.000]  This is totally illegal, extremely dangerous, completely out of control.
[09:30.000 --> 09:35.000]  But see, the average person online thinks it's voodoo to know anything.
[09:35.000 --> 09:47.000]  So they thought I must have magically just thought this up on my own or I'm in the CIA as if people in the CIA know anything.
[09:47.000 --> 09:49.000]  That's a low-level criminal organization.
[09:49.000 --> 09:58.000]  So here it is. Opposition to COVID measures is terrorism. Claims of election fraud is terrorism.
[09:58.000 --> 10:02.000]  Belief that Trump can be reinstated is terrorism.
[10:02.000 --> 10:10.000]  Now you can go read the June 2021 document for yourself.
[10:10.000 --> 10:18.000]  And I'm going to be going over all this because they plan to implement this and I'm going to explain how they're going to do it and how they're going to bankrupt you and take everything you've got to destroy your life.
[10:18.000 --> 10:22.000]  Unless you wake up and say no. This is a real globalist takeover.
[10:22.000 --> 10:31.000]  But first, a very important report on the fall of Afghanistan by design by the Puppet and Chief Biden.
[10:31.000 --> 10:38.000]  Similar to the 7.2 magnitude earthquake that rocked Haiti.
[10:38.000 --> 10:42.000]  That massive 7.2 earthquake leaving hundreds dead.
[10:42.000 --> 11:03.000]  The Taliban is a force of nature causing tectonic shifts under a crumbling Biden administration led by the NOS by incompetent Defense Department bigwigs that have mismanaged the effort in Afghanistan from day one destroying the lives of countless American soldiers.
[11:03.000 --> 11:17.000]  The United States will continue to support consular services and that includes the processing and operations of the special immigrant visa program and will continue to engage in diplomacy with the Afghan government and the Afghan people.
[11:17.000 --> 11:21.000]  Additionally, we will continue our focus on counterterrorism.
[11:21.000 --> 11:46.000]  Regardless of Biden's half-baked prediction, is the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan now inevitable? No, it is not. Because you have the Afghan troops have 300,000 well equipped as well as equipped as any army in the world and an Air Force against something like 75,000 Taliban.
[11:46.000 --> 12:01.000]  It is not inevitable. I was up in that pass where Osama bin Laden was allegedly escaped or out of harm's way. We went for two reasons.
[12:01.000 --> 12:20.000]  One, two. In just nine days, the Taliban took control of more than half of Afghanistan's provinces and as Biden has done when it comes to the border, the economy and COVID.
[12:20.000 --> 12:35.000]  Biden blamed the Trump administration for the chaos in Afghanistan while Trump responded to the mischaracterization. As Biden's globalist mouthpiece, Jen Psaki revealed just how disconnected this administration is.
[12:35.000 --> 12:40.000]  The Taliban also has to make an assessment about what they want their role to be in the international community.
[12:40.000 --> 12:59.000]  Anyone with any recollection will recall that the Trump administration bombed the Taliban to the negotiating table as the New York Post recounted after warning Taliban leader Hibbatullah Akhanzada that he would come back and hit you harder than any country has ever been hit.
[12:59.000 --> 13:13.000]  If he welched on the deal, Trump made good on his threat and launched punishing airstrikes the first time the Taliban violated the agreement. Since then, not a single U.S. soldier has died in combat in Afghanistan.
[13:13.000 --> 13:29.000]  That they had to kill people in order to put themselves in a little better negotiating position. When they did that, they killed 12 people. One happened to be a great American soldier and we've hit the Taliban harder in the last four days than they've been hitting over 10 years.
[13:29.000 --> 13:45.000]  Biden, who has always regarded himself as a foreign policy genius, is now frantically upping the ante, increasing troops from 3,000 to 5,000 in order to avoid what could be his Saigon moment.
[13:45.000 --> 13:57.000]  In April of 75, North Vietnamese troops approached the southern capital of Saigon. President Gerald Ford ordered all U.S. troops and citizens out of the country.
[13:57.000 --> 14:01.000]  To permit the movement of refugees to the area of their choice.
[14:01.000 --> 14:14.000]  In the early hours of April 30, despite multiple flights with hundreds of evacuees and with time running out, Barry uttered three words that meant it was imperative for the U.S. diplomat to leave.
[14:14.000 --> 14:21.000]  So he comes up, gets on, we fly out with the ambassador and you make the call, you know, tiger, tiger, tiger, that means the ambassador's out.
[14:21.000 --> 14:36.000]  I'm embarrassed that the United States of America is being humiliated and is leaving an area that we had come to defend and we've been defeated.
[14:36.000 --> 14:50.000]  As embassy staff are evacuated, the Taliban is setting up an invasion into the capital city that could lapse into a bloodbath. In 2001, the Taliban abandoned Kabul following the U.S. invasion.
[14:50.000 --> 15:08.000]  At that time, Kabul's population was half a million. As the U.S. dug its heels into a two decade occupation, Kabul was transformed into a growing urban middle class center, exponentially skyrocketing into a population of 4.6 million.
[15:08.000 --> 15:23.000]  Meanwhile, Biden's reliance on a massive and highly trained Afghan military has already been defeated from one end of the country to the other, as Mazar Aishareef, the Afghan government's last stronghold, has fallen.
[15:23.000 --> 15:39.000]  Meanwhile, America watches a failing commander in chief in the first year of his presidency, mired in globalist directives, distracted with the targeting of American citizens and foreign policy disasters, vacationing at Camp David.
[15:39.000 --> 15:53.000]  The American knows, whether they want to or not, that a real U.S. president wouldn't be able to sleep or leave the White House under the unprecedented pressure and intense scrutiny threatening their legacy.
[15:53.000 --> 16:18.000]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[16:18.000 --> 16:28.000]  Now, Back in Stock just came back in yesterday. Very powerful, pure, tumeric, extract, tincture. Not a sure immune system, but for inflammation and a lot more.
[16:28.000 --> 16:36.000]  And then, sold out for more than six months because of supply chain breakdowns. We finally have the activated charcoal toothpaste with natural peppermint and so much more.
[16:36.000 --> 16:43.000]  Back in stock from Dr. Jones Naturals and the mouthwash with the activated charcoal and essential oils is back in stock.
[16:43.000 --> 16:50.000]  They're great products, they're high quality, and they fund the InfoWars, so thank you all for your support. Check them out today at InfoWarsStore.com.
[16:50.000 --> 17:00.000]  The sale runs for only one week. It is the booster bodies, natural defenses, super sale, and another part of the sale ending is the privacy pouches for your cell phone.
[17:00.000 --> 17:13.000]  Let's go back in time, say, to the mid-1990s. And then imagine a science fiction movie set in the year 2020, where a world government's being established, where members of Congress and former presidents are censured by big tech,
[17:13.000 --> 17:23.000]  and where if you don't take an experimental injection that grows blood plots and prions all over your body, then you're not allowed to fly on an airplane.
[17:23.000 --> 17:32.000]  Think about that, because that's where we are. Imagine just 20, 30 years ago, tell just five years ago, if somebody told you this would be happening.
[17:32.000 --> 17:41.000]  But it is happening now. And then they tell you, oh, sorry, it's not a vaccine, it's a gene therapy, and it doesn't really work, so you've got to take it every few months.
[17:41.000 --> 17:49.000]  And the people that have submitted say, great, I want to take it all the time so I can go outside and not get sick from COVID, even though it gets you sick from COVID.
[17:49.000 --> 17:56.000]  And now there's record numbers of really sick people from the sloughing, the shedding of the virus. And that's in mainline studies.
[17:56.000 --> 18:20.000]  Bill Gates and Fauci did this, need to go to prison for it right now.
[18:27.000 --> 18:36.000]  It's back in stock at infowarstore.com, discounted because of the COVID lockdown, because of the globalist siege on small businesses and companies in America.
[18:36.000 --> 18:47.000]  It's not been available for over six months, but now it's back in stock and it's available in only two places, infowarstore.com and drjonesnaturals.com.
[18:47.000 --> 19:00.000]  It is our activated charcoal toothpaste and mouthwash. So get your activated charcoal toothpaste, activated charcoal mouthwash with central oils and more at infowarstore.com and fund the info war, a true 360 win.
[19:17.000 --> 19:27.000]  And so even though it seems like the globalists are winning, the truth is they've had to come out of the open to attack human freedom because they're actually losing.
[19:27.000 --> 19:36.000]  We have forced them out in the open. So as bad as these times are, and a lot of negative things are about to happen, realize humanity is winning.
[19:36.000 --> 19:46.000]  You've got to trust in the plan of God and trust in the plan of God's justice. That is invincible. That is ethereal, timeless and unstoppable.
[19:46.000 --> 19:56.000]  So don't trust in man, trust in God to lead God and direct your soul and then take action against the globalists and realize you've got my commitment from Alex Jones and my crew to you.
[19:56.000 --> 20:20.000]  We will never back down from the globalists and we will never surrender.
[20:27.000 --> 20:39.000]  Coming to you live from deep in the heart of Texas, broadcasting worldwide, I'm Alex Jones, your host on this August 15 Sunday transmission.
[20:39.000 --> 20:44.000]  Thanks so much for joining us.
[20:44.000 --> 21:04.000]  Okay, let's just plow right into the big story. And it's not the fall of Afghanistan. It's no, it's the fall of Western civilization by design by the globalist part of their post industrial agenda 2030 plan that I've been warning of for decades that we're now in the middle of.
[21:04.000 --> 21:16.000]  So here's the headline. It's on info wars.com. It's an RT article. Biden DHS officially designates anti lockdown protesters as terrorists.
[21:16.000 --> 21:42.000]  You can go read the whole article. Here's NBC News potential terror threats. Number one terror threat to Homeland Security Bulletin opposition to COVID measures claims of election fraud. Believe Trump can be reinstated. And in the RT article, and in the NBC article, they have links to the memos links to all of the information there for you to see that for yourself.
[21:42.000 --> 22:03.000]  Now, here's where it all comes from. Remember, as soon as Biden got his way in through fraud in January of this year, now six and a half months ago, the first press conferences they had with General Milley and with Jen Psaki, and with all these people and the Justice Department was
[22:03.000 --> 22:19.000]  protesting the election is terror. And we're preparing to use the FBI CIA against the new terror threat, which is Trump supporters. And then they started saying about a few weeks later and people that don't like lockdowns that are coming.
[22:19.000 --> 22:34.000]  I said, wow, more lockdowns are coming. We already knew that. But then they started saying it. And then on page 10 of the national strategy for countering domestic terrorism came out two months ago. They made it official policy.
[22:34.000 --> 22:55.000]  They said any narratives of fraud in the recent general election. You put it back on screen for me. Thanks. The emboldening impact of the violent breach of the US Capitol conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic and conspiracy theories promoting violence will almost certainly spur some one to try to engage in
[22:55.000 --> 23:12.000]  violence. So who tried to engage in violence last year in this year? It was the FBI cooking up terror plots with the Michigan Militia, which they were leading that particular group and it was all a setup. And it's come out in court. The FBI agent didn't just beat up his wife at a
[23:12.000 --> 23:29.000]  swing or sex party bashing her head bloody. He's so psychotic, reportedly, but then he turned over the audio files to the defense where they brag about setting them up and framing them. That's that's in the Michigan news.
[23:29.000 --> 23:47.000]  So there's one plot to kidnap a governor because of the lockdown. And that was the FBI creating the whole thing. And the head of the agent is such a looks like somebody would like rule of penitentiary or something like like the white supremacist wing.
[23:47.000 --> 24:01.000]  Not saying he's a white supremacist, but I mean, if I saw him pumping gas, I'd say that's a hardened con, probably a murderer, probably out after 20 years. And so just remember that's who they're hiring. That's what they're preparing for total war with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[24:01.000 --> 24:19.000]  And the entire leadership of the group was FBI. You can have you want type in Kalamazoo, FBI agent arrested for assaulting wife at sex party. And he's the lead guy. And I'm just pointing out the level of scum we're dealing here with now.
[24:19.000 --> 24:34.000]  I mean, that's who runs your government. That's who's in control of it now just discredited fraudulent garbage. Does that mean every agency's bad or every agent's bad? No, but the people they pick for dirty tricks like this are bad people.
[24:34.000 --> 24:54.000]  And this is a declaration of war against the American people. So clearly they're going to stage very soon. There he is. They're going to stage very soon terror attacks to blame it on us. That's the next card. That's the next move. That's what you should expect.
[24:54.000 --> 25:04.000]  Now, there it is. FBI agent charged with beating wife until she had blood all over her at sex party after sex party. So that's how this dude rolls.
[25:04.000 --> 25:25.000]  And again, evil people are arrogant and full of hutzpah bravada. He sent files before the sex party a week before two weeks before to the defense, admitting the whole setup.
[25:25.000 --> 25:37.000]  I mean, it's the enemy just falls in our hands that way because they're inherently bad people. Just incredible. I'm sorry. I'm digressing.
[25:37.000 --> 25:52.000]  So imagine in the year 2021, the southern border is completely wide open. There are people coming across with bubonic plague cases spreading all over the United States now in four states.
[25:52.000 --> 26:10.000]  They are pouring across with hundreds of tropical diseases that are extremely rare, even in the tropics that are now spreading all over the United States, but they're going to tell you that your five year old needs to wear a mask.
[26:10.000 --> 26:25.000]  That's just the cultic, evil, lazy, leftist teachers union wanting to swing their filthy weight around. And so I'm going to calm down next segment. I'm going to cover all the news.
[26:25.000 --> 26:45.000]  So just I've I've I'm not complaining. I spent my wife spent out of town. So most of my children are gone right now. And so I've been studying 12 hours a day, 12 hours a day.
[26:45.000 --> 26:58.000]  I studied about five hours Friday. I studied about 14 hours yesterday. And I studied about seven hours today. And I'm just too loaded for bear.
[26:58.000 --> 27:06.000]  I mean, let me let me just calm down and I'm going to come back and I'm going to restart the whole broadcast and I'm going to go right into all this.
[27:06.000 --> 27:16.000]  But do you understand what this means? I mean, this is horrible. And let me explain something really important here that I'll get into next segment.
[27:16.000 --> 27:25.000]  Compliance with all this evil is what keeps making it worse. Going along with this is why everything's falling apart.
[27:25.000 --> 27:35.000]  The Taliban are cavemen and they are terrible people and they keep little boys as sex slaves. Something actually the Democratic Party came out internal memos and said is kind of cool.
[27:35.000 --> 27:44.000]  And they let them have kidnapped children as young as three in rape dungeons all over the Afghan stand. I told you about that years ago, but now that's in the news.
[27:44.000 --> 27:57.000]  So they are a caveman pedophilic demon creature. The main line men are. And homosexuality is about 90% in Afghanistan, about 50% in the Middle East.
[27:57.000 --> 28:02.000]  That's why the left loves them. I mean, hell, they got giant grooming gangs in England, 10,000 girls, one town, 5,000 another.
[28:02.000 --> 28:09.000]  They're young as six years old. They complain. They chop them up, put them in meat kabob machines. And again, your new list, you think this sounds crazy.
[28:09.000 --> 28:18.000]  But he takes live babies, keeps them alive, scalps them, puts their brains and their hair on rats. And they chain people up and put maggots inside their brains, eat their brains.
[28:18.000 --> 28:23.000]  And they chain up vehicles and do it. I mean, that's all through. I can pull it all up for you right now.
[28:23.000 --> 28:32.000]  Okay. And the FBI just, you know, beats his wife up at sex parties. I mean, it's just hell upon earth. Do you understand?
[28:32.000 --> 28:44.000]  And then when I come back, I'm going to explain something. At least the Afghans stand up for themselves and don't comply. That's why the biggest, sickest, most evil system in the world can't get control of them because they won't bow.
[28:44.000 --> 28:53.000]  But we do whatever we're told and land in the free home of the brave. And so now the American Medical Association says they're going to take boy and girl off the reverse certificates.
[28:53.000 --> 29:00.000]  And now they're going to teach children as young as four to pick their own sex and sterilize them. That's just now breaking.
[29:00.000 --> 29:07.000]  What are champions made of? Here's a man who can show you.

[34:03.640 --> 34:08.120]  be hosting the third and fourth hour which is called Sunday live this is the
[34:08.120 --> 34:12.880]  ocean show Sunday edition and Sunday live only has six minutes of ads on hour
[34:12.880 --> 34:16.880]  just for local stations we cut the network ads so there's less ads so
[34:16.880 --> 34:25.560]  powerful two hours every Sunday evening let me do this this segment because I am
[34:25.560 --> 34:30.600]  on information overload let me explain why I make such a big deal out of the
[34:30.600 --> 34:35.600]  fact that I'm not the one making these predictions now I am good at reading more
[34:35.600 --> 34:38.720]  globalist documents than pretty much anybody else does probably except their
[34:38.720 --> 34:45.040]  top people everybody's so specialized in business and in life and in media and in
[34:45.040 --> 34:48.640]  culture that somebody knows about golf or they know about rock and roll or they
[34:48.640 --> 34:52.200]  know about insurance policies or they know about race cars or they know about
[34:52.200 --> 34:57.600]  education and they know about their area of education well I'm a generalist and I
[34:57.600 --> 35:04.080]  read at least six seven hours a day and I thought it was a pretty big deal in
[35:04.080 --> 35:10.040]  June when they put out the new official terrorism policy and said we got more
[35:10.040 --> 35:13.360]  lockdowns coming and we're gonna say you're a terrorist if you're against
[35:13.360 --> 35:18.200]  these things and if you even criticize things you're aiding and abetting
[35:18.200 --> 35:21.840]  terrorists and we're gonna use the US Pentagon and military and I say against
[35:21.840 --> 35:26.040]  you I mean that's so illegal on a scale of one to ten ten being total tyranny
[35:26.040 --> 35:33.400]  zero being freedom it's a 9.7 and you know how frustrating it is that when
[35:33.400 --> 35:38.560]  this hit Friday night and Saturday and I trended at the top of Twitter politics
[35:38.560 --> 35:42.600]  and the top of Instagram people sent it to me everyone was marveling and
[35:42.600 --> 35:47.800]  debating how I knew this and playing clips of me saying it and even the clips
[35:47.800 --> 35:55.840]  people put out on the internet didn't have me showing you where see see see it's
[35:55.840 --> 36:00.360]  the frustration that people don't understand the reason I know what's
[36:00.360 --> 36:04.320]  gonna happen is not because I have a 200 IQ which I don't have it's because
[36:04.320 --> 36:11.120]  that's the enemy battle plan I have their damn playbook just like Steve
[36:11.120 --> 36:15.240]  Belichick keeps winning Super Bowl because it's well known he's fricking pays
[36:15.240 --> 36:20.800]  he steals their playbooks they all do it the point is is that we have the damn
[36:20.800 --> 36:25.800]  playbook and so let me explain the playbook to you okay let me explain the
[36:25.800 --> 36:31.560]  playbook to you this is a permanent world government Rockefeller Foundation
[36:31.560 --> 36:36.160]  cooked up plan cooperation lockstep they're never gonna end the lockdowns
[36:36.160 --> 36:39.960]  they're just gonna tighten them down loosen them up some tighten them down
[36:39.960 --> 36:44.120]  more loosen up son through successful approximation until you have a world ID
[36:44.120 --> 36:49.080]  card global carbon tax systems your phone tracking everywhere you go force
[36:49.080 --> 36:53.760]  gene therapies on a monthly basis of whatever the system wants to put into
[36:53.760 --> 36:59.360]  you whenever they want no more FDA process no more nothing just absolute
[36:59.360 --> 37:04.880]  total tyranny and by shutting down the world economy and calling small
[37:04.880 --> 37:09.680]  businesses not essential it will cause a massive collapse in productivity and a
[37:09.680 --> 37:13.440]  global depression which they will then use with their trillions of fiat money
[37:13.440 --> 37:20.920]  to buy up the planet and they've all written books about it Ted Turner Prince
[37:20.920 --> 37:27.080]  Philip David Rockefeller Bill Gates plow Schwab the big to presently I've
[37:27.080 --> 37:36.120]  read all their books I watch 20 hours of UNWHO hearings
[37:36.120 --> 37:46.200]  in December of 2019 and we put out a 30 minute boil down of 20 hours and there
[37:46.200 --> 37:49.320]  they're meeting in Switzerland and they said it's a total emergency everyone's
[37:49.320 --> 37:53.640]  waking up to us we're just given vaccines for the Bill and Melinda Gates
[37:53.640 --> 37:57.000]  Foundation and told to give them to people they're not even studied all of
[37:57.000 --> 38:00.640]  our frontline doctors are about to quit they're getting wobbly we've got to do
[38:00.640 --> 38:04.120]  something and I said on here when that document came out those videos came out
[38:04.120 --> 38:10.840]  we learned about it till January 2020 I said this COVID thing out of England
[38:10.840 --> 38:14.680]  that's really where it comes out of and into the US and given to the Chinese
[38:14.680 --> 38:23.600]  this bio weapon cooked up in London it's the answer to this to have such a huge
[38:23.600 --> 38:28.640]  event and so many people freaked out and scared that then people will accept the
[38:28.640 --> 38:32.680]  injections their gene therapies and then I went and looked by February of last
[38:32.680 --> 38:39.080]  year on record with top scientists all agreeing that you could never have again
[38:39.080 --> 38:44.000]  a COVID vaccine for the entire Corona family because of the protein in the
[38:44.000 --> 38:49.080]  virus is the same protein all over your body so your body attacks itself and you
[38:49.080 --> 38:53.560]  die of blood clots in your lungs heart and brain bare minimum and I started
[38:53.560 --> 38:57.560]  seeing this in February and just started studying more I mean I've read
[38:57.560 --> 39:01.480]  thousands of studies I've had hundreds of doctors and scientists on we've played
[39:01.480 --> 39:05.720]  clips of hundreds of others here I've got like 35 clips of scientists top
[39:05.720 --> 39:12.000]  people Nobel Prize winners just totally freaking out right now and back then they
[39:12.000 --> 39:16.040]  said it's going to cause blood clots it's going to hurt people it's gonna cause
[39:16.040 --> 39:21.040]  autoimmune responses so that the people that have taken the shots are going to
[39:21.040 --> 39:25.960]  slough these prions these viruses off and it's gonna cause a giant wave of
[39:25.960 --> 39:31.760]  illness within six to eight months now that was all theoretical now they did
[39:31.760 --> 39:36.280]  the injections the gene therapy it's not a vaccine and now everybody I know
[39:36.280 --> 39:43.000]  that is around family that's been injected with these so-called vaccines
[39:43.000 --> 39:49.040]  that are really nanotech replicators are now getting sick literally half the
[39:49.040 --> 39:54.160]  people I know are sick and in bed right now I asked them to call everyone they
[39:54.160 --> 40:00.240]  know everyone they know is 30 40 50% sick I my my wife went to Omaha to see
[40:00.240 --> 40:05.560]  family half the people are sick she got sick up there it's everywhere see it was
[40:05.560 --> 40:10.840]  fake a year ago and they called car wrecks and cancer and gunshot wounds and
[40:10.840 --> 40:15.480]  motorcycle accidents COVID that was to get you to take the shot there's a real
[40:15.480 --> 40:19.200]  virus gain a function of Camero they own and they already tested it in rats
[40:19.200 --> 40:25.680]  years ago that when you then create a vaccine for that virus it produces
[40:25.680 --> 40:29.480]  something that replicates in your body and they discovered this 50 years ago
[40:29.480 --> 40:33.200]  if you try to make a vaccine for any coronavirus even with standard vaccines
[40:33.200 --> 40:37.320]  it produces these prions that are deadly that slough it's basically a
[40:37.320 --> 40:41.680]  synthetic virus so they knew and found she knew and Gates knew and in
[40:41.680 --> 40:47.640]  University of Texas led the national initiative for Obama and Fauci from 2010
[40:47.640 --> 40:55.080]  to 2015 and spent hundreds and millions of dollars at Baylor Medical and UT
[40:55.080 --> 41:00.120]  Medical with five other universities seven total and they did hundreds of
[41:00.120 --> 41:03.440]  studies on rats and other animals and found almost a hundred percent death
[41:03.440 --> 41:07.000]  rate from prions and they say in the studies that I've shown you dozens of
[41:07.000 --> 41:13.640]  times do not give this to humans it will kill them so they knew this would
[41:13.640 --> 41:18.520]  happen you understand what that means it's over folks they have been planted
[41:18.520 --> 41:23.520]  half the United States at least with a system that's basically spongiform
[41:23.520 --> 41:30.400]  encephalopathy mad cow disease I have just today seven scientists that are
[41:30.400 --> 41:37.240]  about to tell you this on video next hour clips seven former head of the
[41:37.240 --> 41:43.680]  science division of Pfizer top scientists at MIT you name it they did it on
[41:43.680 --> 41:51.280]  purpose they've never had a vaccine for the cold because it kills the animals
[41:51.280 --> 41:56.600]  and in human trials they've done all over the world it kills a large percentage
[41:56.600 --> 42:05.320]  of those in the human trials normally 30% are dead within a year do you
[42:05.320 --> 42:08.800]  understand what this means
[42:09.280 --> 42:13.880]  everybody's calling me oh you're right again oh how'd you know that all over
[42:13.880 --> 42:17.280]  the US they keep babies alive and harvest their organs and vivisect them
[42:17.280 --> 42:20.800]  all their hearts are still beating and do experiments on them because it was in
[42:20.800 --> 42:25.360]  the damn letter return 20 years ago now it's mainstream news they're coming for
[42:25.360 --> 42:30.760]  you they're killing you and they don't care if you're a schoolteacher or a
[42:30.760 --> 42:36.040]  bureaucrat or a banker so many CEOs and top people have died from the shots as
[42:36.040 --> 42:43.520]  well this is just hell on earth premeditated psychotic murder and now
[42:43.520 --> 42:46.760]  they're gonna say this winter with all the incredible death you never see
[42:46.760 --> 42:49.960]  stuff like this in the summer all these diseases imagine this winter they're
[42:49.960 --> 42:53.760]  gonna blame the unvaccinated and declare martial law and Biden's ready to do it
[42:53.760 --> 43:01.960]  my god it's here total extermination so when I first started taking survival
[43:01.960 --> 43:06.340]  shield basically I was 275 pounds I was overweight I had brain fog like you
[43:06.340 --> 43:10.560]  wouldn't believe I was barely holding on to a job and I heard Dr. Group on your
[43:10.560 --> 43:13.880]  show and I listened to it so the first one I got was the original survival
[43:13.880 --> 43:17.800]  shield the X1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out
[43:17.800 --> 43:20.640]  with that too you have you know with the deep burdens towards you know and I got
[43:20.640 --> 43:24.600]  really excited about that so I took it and man in two weeks I went from brain
[43:24.600 --> 43:29.880]  fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened you know I could think again
[43:29.880 --> 43:34.120]  I could connect with people again and over the course of the next couple of
[43:34.120 --> 43:37.680]  years I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your
[43:37.680 --> 43:41.040]  supplements there they're all absolutely amazing supplements the one I like
[43:41.040 --> 43:44.800]  recently is knockout literally like if you want to sleep just take it it's
[43:44.800 --> 43:48.480]  amazing it works but anyway so the point is we have to get ourselves clean
[43:48.480 --> 43:52.280]  that's a break free of the globalist system and the only way to do that is to
[43:52.280 --> 43:56.560]  take our own health into our own hand beautifully said brother I thank you so
[43:56.560 --> 44:02.080]  much for your call and Godspeed it is through our five senses that we are
[44:02.080 --> 44:07.040]  kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told and the only way to see
[44:07.040 --> 44:12.040]  through this illusion is with our higher senses which is why fluoridated water is
[44:12.040 --> 44:16.960]  a big problem consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the
[44:16.960 --> 44:21.800]  pineal gland and shuts down its natural functions natural functions which have
[44:21.800 --> 44:26.040]  been known for millennia the Hindu chakras align with the endocrine system
[44:26.040 --> 44:31.240]  the chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye also described as the
[44:31.240 --> 44:35.560]  seat of the soul the pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of
[44:35.560 --> 44:40.680]  consciousness and otherwise unseen dimensions of reality fluoride free
[44:40.680 --> 44:46.040]  water is essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy our water filtration
[44:46.040 --> 44:51.080]  systems with the proper filters will keep your drinking water fluoride free and
[44:51.080 --> 44:56.400]  the propure showerhead will seal the deal get them both today for yourself or a
[44:56.400 --> 45:04.000]  friend at infowarstore.com let's go back in time say to the mid 1990s and then
[45:04.000 --> 45:08.480]  imagine a science fiction movie set in the year 2020 where a world government's
[45:08.480 --> 45:12.000]  being established where members of Congress and former presidents are
[45:12.000 --> 45:16.800]  centered by big tech and where if you don't take an experimental injection that
[45:16.800 --> 45:21.840]  grows blood plots and prions all over your body that you're not allowed to
[45:21.840 --> 45:27.360]  fly on an airplane think about that because that's where we are imagine just
[45:27.360 --> 45:32.120]  20 30 years ago tell just five years ago if somebody told you this would be
[45:32.120 --> 45:37.080]  happening but it is happening now and then they tell you oh sorry it's not a
[45:37.080 --> 45:41.080]  vaccine is a gene therapy and it doesn't really work she got to take it every few
[45:41.080 --> 45:45.240]  months and the people that have submitted say great I want to take it all
[45:45.240 --> 45:48.800]  the time so I can go outside and not get sick from COVID even though it gets you
[45:48.800 --> 45:52.880]  sick from COVID and now there's record numbers of really sick people from the
[45:52.880 --> 45:57.280]  sloughing the shedding of the virus and that's in mainline studies Bill Gates and
[45:57.280 --> 46:03.320]  Fauci did this need to go to prison for it right now the first time I heard the
[46:03.320 --> 46:08.320]  speech the first time I read the writings of Teddy Roosevelt I was in sixth
[46:08.320 --> 46:13.480]  grade and we have this history teacher that had us write a paper on the man in
[46:13.480 --> 46:17.280]  the arena and I just remember thinking about that saying I want to be the man
[46:17.280 --> 46:20.960]  in the arena but when it comes to media in full wars has been the tip of that
[46:20.960 --> 46:26.000]  spear but Mike Lindell has come along and done just as good a job as we've done
[46:26.000 --> 46:30.160]  maybe even better when it comes to election fraud and other issues and

[47:23.280 --> 47:28.480]  well ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us on this August 15
[47:28.480 --> 47:32.800]  Sunday broadcast Chris Skyes can be popping up the star of the next hour he
[47:32.800 --> 47:37.600]  led giant demonstrations in Canada in just the last few days there are huge
[47:37.600 --> 47:44.680]  demonstrations from Israel to the UK to France to Germany all over the world
[47:44.680 --> 47:48.440]  there's protests in African countries against lockdowns where it actually
[47:48.440 --> 47:53.360]  stars people to death when that happens and so millions are hitting the streets
[47:53.360 --> 47:58.320]  and the it seems the epicenter one of the most oppressive places other than
[47:58.320 --> 48:03.600]  Australia the former president colony great people by the way just like Israel
[48:03.600 --> 48:11.160]  is Israel and we had Shlomo Gordon on a while back ago I wanted to get a quick
[48:11.160 --> 48:15.760]  update this segment the next segment from him he's originally from Chicago then
[48:15.760 --> 48:20.200]  went to Israel was a tank crewman the Israeli army so he bio physics University
[48:20.200 --> 48:23.640]  I'm not gonna go over at all and sort of getting involved in Israeli politics is
[48:23.640 --> 48:29.640]  now we started up a pro-medical freedom party in Israel has been helping leave
[48:29.640 --> 48:35.000]  the opposition to what I can only call 1984 the government freedom bracelets
[48:35.000 --> 48:40.560]  and freedom passes and now one of the most highly so-called injected or
[48:40.560 --> 48:46.800]  inoculated groups in the world what is it eight out of ten I was reading are
[48:46.800 --> 48:50.600]  having massive numbers of people vaccinated in the hospital so to give us
[48:50.600 --> 48:57.120]  the latest on this bizarre 1984 epicenter that Israel's become is mr. Gordon
[48:57.120 --> 49:02.400]  thanks for coming on with us hi thank you so much Alex show only got about 15
[49:02.400 --> 49:08.360]  minutes tell us what's happening yeah so like you said at this point the rate of
[49:08.360 --> 49:11.800]  people being in the hospital if they're vaccinated or not vaccinated it's a
[49:11.800 --> 49:17.760]  total joke at this point the percentage of people who are vaccinated out of the
[49:17.760 --> 49:22.480]  total sick and hot in the COVID words in the hospitals are higher than the
[49:22.480 --> 49:26.240]  percentage of the population that are vaccinated so the meaning so the meaning
[49:26.240 --> 49:31.160]  of that is that you're even more likely to be in a COVID word of the hospital if
[49:31.160 --> 49:35.600]  you're vaccinated and they're starting with the with the third dose for people
[49:35.600 --> 49:40.920]  who are 40 plus I just wanted to tie in with what you were recently speaking
[49:40.920 --> 49:45.720]  about about them in America being called domestic terrorists if you don't want to
[49:45.720 --> 49:51.320]  get the jabs you're gonna be a domestic terrorist but here in Israel first we
[49:51.320 --> 49:56.560]  call this anti-vaxxers then they called us COVID deniers which is the worst
[49:56.560 --> 50:01.480]  because you know that that's supposed to be like Holocaust deniers right so
[50:01.480 --> 50:07.280]  they're calling Jews who some of which had our descendants of Holocaust
[50:07.280 --> 50:13.680]  survivors they're calling them COVID deniers on the same you know expression
[50:13.680 --> 50:20.720]  of Holocaust deniers and then and now they've moved forward to a vaccine
[50:20.720 --> 50:27.280]  refusers on the same idea of people who refuse to drive to the army so it's
[50:27.280 --> 50:31.400]  like if you're patriotic you drive to the army and you get vaccinated that's the
[50:31.400 --> 50:36.360]  idea so if you're you're also not patriotic and recent and I one of the
[50:36.360 --> 50:41.840]  reasons I wanted to mention my army service as a as a tank loader is that I
[50:41.840 --> 50:47.120]  serve as you said after moving to Israel spent three years mandatory service
[50:47.120 --> 50:53.800]  seven years in reserves and I recently for all intents and purposes
[50:53.800 --> 51:01.440]  not only discharged because I didn't get vaccinated and now people were joking
[51:01.440 --> 51:06.320]  about that oh can we let the anti-vaxxers not pay taxes to that's gonna
[51:06.320 --> 51:09.880]  really make them you know and by the way I don't want to correct you because I
[51:09.880 --> 51:13.800]  have to say vaccine to people know what that means this is not a vaccine this is
[51:13.800 --> 51:17.720]  a gene therapy they call a vaccine that was never correct me if I'm wrong but
[51:17.720 --> 51:21.400]  just like in Europe just like in the US just like in Canada they skip the normal
[51:21.400 --> 51:26.480]  approval process in Israel right they skip the process and we actually tried
[51:26.480 --> 51:33.920]  to while I was running for Vanessa back in 2019 I came across from being in
[51:33.920 --> 51:38.040]  contact with activists I came across this story called the Saidi's app and I
[51:38.040 --> 51:42.160]  have on my YouTube I have also video it's called on YouTube it's called huge
[51:42.160 --> 51:50.040]  scandal in Israel something along those lines half a million Israeli babies over
[51:50.040 --> 51:53.200]  the course of five years got an experimental hepatitis B vaccine and
[51:53.200 --> 52:00.640]  that also they skipped over usually Israel trusts yeah here in the bottom
[52:00.640 --> 52:11.880]  left corner scandal in Israel I did the subtitles for that one so yeah they
[52:11.880 --> 52:16.600]  skipped over usually of Israel unfortunately trusts American standards
[52:16.600 --> 52:20.000]  the FDA well on that one they didn't even wait for the FDA approval that was
[52:20.000 --> 52:24.720]  an experimental Israel vaccine they probably thought that it wasn't gonna
[52:24.720 --> 52:30.920]  cause significantly more damages because it had the same amount of of antigen and
[52:30.920 --> 52:36.560]  adjuvants but the way that it was distributed within the vaccine ended
[52:36.560 --> 52:41.200]  up causing crate one of the women in in the in the picture of that video
[52:41.200 --> 52:46.560]  Nourit she actually had both of her twins but were autistic from from the
[52:46.560 --> 52:51.360]  vaccine just to get it was extremely dangerous one so Israel unfortunately has
[52:51.360 --> 52:56.960]  a dark history of human experimentation the truth has to be said and by the way
[52:56.960 --> 53:00.240]  let's expand on that I mean I don't say this
[53:00.240 --> 53:05.720]  statistically of Israel is gonna follow what the United States does the US is a
[53:05.720 --> 53:09.480]  big country nice people but our medical system has been extremely evil and
[53:09.480 --> 53:13.440]  everything that somebody in World War two learned they learned from the British
[53:13.440 --> 53:16.760]  and the United States called eugenics and all the secret testing and let's not
[53:16.760 --> 53:20.720]  forget 40 years of injecting black people with syphilis and then having them
[53:20.720 --> 53:25.120]  spread it to hundreds of thousands of people tens of thousands died of that
[53:25.120 --> 53:29.640]  brain-eating disease so I hope Israel doesn't copy the US to start injecting
[53:29.640 --> 53:36.200]  you with syphilis unfortunately the hard truth and again just I want people
[53:36.200 --> 53:42.280]  understand where I'm coming from I'm very much if we're done with the
[53:42.280 --> 53:47.120]  spectrum of right and left I'm very much on the right I'm very very in favor of
[53:47.120 --> 53:51.400]  having a Jewish country with Jewish values with the Jewish majority I'm
[53:51.400 --> 53:56.800]  definitely on the left I'm actually I see live over the green line I'm set I
[53:56.800 --> 54:01.640]  live in the West Bank or I'm a settler or whatever you want to call it so just
[54:01.640 --> 54:07.800]  so people can know where I'm coming from okay and like I said I served in in no
[54:07.800 --> 54:12.880]  no we understand and so tell us tell us what it's doing is really but but just
[54:12.880 --> 54:19.240]  so the people understand that the current state of Israel meaning not King
[54:19.240 --> 54:25.120]  Solomon and not and not the Hasmonean dynasty under the Kohanim under the
[54:25.120 --> 54:30.480]  priest Judah Makhavi and the like the current state of Israel that we're
[54:30.480 --> 54:35.200]  living in the way that it was founded was an extremely problematic way there
[54:35.200 --> 54:40.160]  were all sorts of deals cut with you know the Belford Declaration for example
[54:40.160 --> 54:47.840]  if you look at who it's written to it's to it's it's the Baron Rothschild okay
[54:47.840 --> 54:51.840]  that's sure you're saying you're saying you're a you're a Jews you you care
[54:51.840 --> 54:55.040]  about it really care about Jews yeah and you're saying there are evil groups
[54:55.040 --> 54:59.880]  manipulating Israel towards a very dangerous place yeah but it's been from
[54:59.880 --> 55:05.600]  the get-go and that's why when the wonderful one of the most wonderful
[55:05.600 --> 55:10.800]  groups of Jews or the Jews that came to that we lived in Yemen and came to and
[55:10.800 --> 55:15.320]  they were so pure and had such pure intentions and they came to they came
[55:15.320 --> 55:20.040]  to the land of Israel and they saw the the the processes being manifested and
[55:20.040 --> 55:24.280]  now you're getting targeted and now you're getting targeted again and then
[55:24.280 --> 55:28.560]  their kids get kidnapped you know and the fact of the matter is that the
[55:28.560 --> 55:34.480]  these the labor Zionists who created the state are very problematic they work
[55:34.480 --> 55:38.240]  together with the Nazis in some cases that's why you have groups like
[55:38.240 --> 55:42.960]  Nitori Carter who you know the one the ultra orthodox Jews that go and meet
[55:42.960 --> 55:46.360]  with the Iranians and the Palestinians what I totally disagree with them but
[55:46.360 --> 55:53.280]  the reason that they exist is because the the labor Zionists had it had the
[55:53.280 --> 55:58.480]  ability to save 500,000 Hungarian Jews from the Nazis and the reason they
[55:58.480 --> 56:01.320]  didn't was because they were ultra orthodox and that didn't fit in with
[56:01.320 --> 56:05.040]  their narrative and with their agenda that's right that's a historical historical
[56:05.040 --> 56:09.320]  fact that they blocked well total millions of Jews escaping Europe during
[56:09.320 --> 56:14.960]  World War two right right so and many and many Jews who were more religious they
[56:14.960 --> 56:18.360]  went to the West they went to America they went to other places they went to
[56:18.360 --> 56:22.080]  South America after after the Holocaust they went to why is modern Israel
[56:22.080 --> 56:26.400]  persecuting what they call ultra orthodox which are just Old Testament
[56:26.400 --> 56:32.160]  Talmud following Jews why are they doing that again you have to understand so
[56:32.160 --> 56:37.120]  there's there's different levels of it the historical level of it is to
[56:37.120 --> 56:41.400]  understand where these labor Zionists came from it's the same place that
[56:41.400 --> 56:45.520]  reformed Judaism came out of which unfortunately in America everyone's
[56:45.520 --> 56:51.720]  affected by it because reformed basically they managed to a hundred years
[56:51.720 --> 56:56.360]  150 years ago you couldn't imagine a Jew that wasn't keeping Shabbat that wasn't
[56:56.360 --> 57:01.560]  keeping the holidays it wasn't keeping kosher and what happened was there was
[57:01.560 --> 57:06.120]  the Sabbath TN movement Shabbat like to be okay listen I will have you back on
[57:06.120 --> 57:08.760]  for a full hour is your smart guy you're really interesting and my producer

[57:34.880 --> 57:38.200]  monolithic group and obviously if you're educated it's not this is very
[57:38.200 --> 57:42.400]  sophisticated stuff there's a big spiritual fight over Israel going on so

[58:16.120 --> 58:21.560]  me back I wanted to just quote from the Bible Jesus is saying as to where we are
[58:21.560 --> 58:27.200]  right now this is Matthew 24 verse 9 then they shall deliver you up to be
[58:27.200 --> 58:33.080]  afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my
[58:33.080 --> 58:38.000]  name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and
[58:38.000 --> 58:42.960]  shall hate one another right where we're at brother and that's because God's name
[58:42.960 --> 58:46.240]  is on the founding of this country no matter what they say and that's why the

[1:00:22.960 --> 1:00:27.800]  not the happy show we used to be our way no ladies and gentlemen we're not
[1:00:27.800 --> 1:00:32.920]  because I've read literally I've scanned over thousands of documents I've read
[1:00:32.920 --> 1:00:39.240]  hundreds of that all the scientists on it's a hundred percent bad the vaccine
[1:00:39.240 --> 1:00:43.760]  they made it doesn't work it makes your body attack itself so why globally was
[1:00:43.760 --> 1:00:48.000]  this done well it's a form of warfare and we're living in it but I wanted you
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:51.800]  to hear from somebody specifically who's got a one of the main political
[1:00:51.800 --> 1:00:57.000]  parties that's having some success getting people elected in Israel for
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:01:03.800]  medical freedom and tyranny always comes first with the medical tyranny in the
[1:01:03.800 --> 1:01:10.400]  last 200 years and so got four minutes left with mr. Gordon slow mo Gordon and
[1:01:10.400 --> 1:01:14.960]  there's any website people should check out it's at slow mo Gordon underscore
[1:01:14.960 --> 1:01:19.600]  Gordon on Twitter YouTube slow mo Gordon does a lot of great work so in the four
[1:01:19.600 --> 1:01:22.520]  minutes we got left I'll invite you back for a full hour soon as you're ready to
[1:01:22.520 --> 1:01:25.360]  do it I know it's late at night over there and I appreciate you being on with
[1:01:25.360 --> 1:01:29.040]  us just in a few minutes tell us what it's like in Israel living under this
[1:01:29.040 --> 1:01:34.680]  medical martial law I think that's a fair term to use yeah well so I just want
[1:01:34.680 --> 1:01:38.920]  to give you a quick rundown since we are limited time of what's starting this
[1:01:38.920 --> 1:01:43.720]  Wednesday so the corona cabinet sounds so official right first of all they
[1:01:43.720 --> 1:01:51.360]  decided to start doing the third dose for 40 age 40 years old and above so
[1:01:51.360 --> 1:01:56.840]  they're already the eventual goal of having three times a year or however
[1:01:56.840 --> 1:02:01.320]  often they're already clearly moving forward to that they're already throwing
[1:02:01.320 --> 1:02:06.160]  hints in the media at some point we'll talk about the fourth and fifth dose the
[1:02:06.160 --> 1:02:10.440]  stuff like that so we're already in the game we're already beyond the game of oh
[1:02:10.440 --> 1:02:14.920]  I'll just get these two jabs and then we go back to normal we're already no this
[1:02:14.920 --> 1:02:19.920]  is the new normal it's already in your face so starting Wednesday we're going
[1:02:19.920 --> 1:02:25.640]  to full green pass so the meaning of this is first of all three year olds since
[1:02:25.640 --> 1:02:30.480]  they're too young to get vaccinated yet at the moment they will need a negative
[1:02:30.480 --> 1:02:36.120]  PCR test and anyone else will need a green pass or a negative test so anyone
[1:02:36.120 --> 1:02:41.680]  from basically everyone's in the same boat from three years and above is in
[1:02:41.680 --> 1:02:45.440]  the same boat you either need to be vaccinated proof that you were sick and
[1:02:45.440 --> 1:02:48.280]  got better and they're making it much more difficult to get the
[1:02:48.280 --> 1:02:52.560]  serological tests they're they're saying oh it's not for sure that you were
[1:02:52.560 --> 1:02:55.720]  sick it's not for sure that you have antibodies on you it's for sure we
[1:02:55.720 --> 1:03:05.040]  inject you with the with the RNA mRNA whatever it is so anyone so you'll
[1:03:05.040 --> 1:03:08.880]  need a green test or a negative test which you have to do the same day but
[1:03:08.880 --> 1:03:12.080]  who's gonna bother doing that right because if you get a positive test
[1:03:12.080 --> 1:03:15.680]  you're gonna have to be at home for 10 days or two weeks I'm not sure what it
[1:03:15.680 --> 1:03:20.320]  is at the moment so you know one wants to be quarantined so the the bottom line
[1:03:20.320 --> 1:03:24.280]  is you need to get vaccinated or else you won't be able to go into any of these
[1:03:24.280 --> 1:03:31.720]  places conferences and exhibitions hotels gyms and studios pools and
[1:03:31.720 --> 1:03:39.520]  country clubs clubs and parties restaurants bars cafes higher education
[1:03:39.520 --> 1:03:44.560]  so colleges and universities you won't be able to get a normal education if
[1:03:44.560 --> 1:03:48.520]  you're not vaccinated you won't be able to go into the university I studied at
[1:03:48.520 --> 1:03:54.360]  university by line won't be able to go in there without a green pass tourist
[1:03:54.360 --> 1:04:01.680]  attractions museums libraries obviously most people get their education on the
[1:04:01.680 --> 1:04:05.680]  internet these days but in case you want to open up a book you want to go to a
[1:04:05.680 --> 1:04:09.520]  library and open up a book you're gonna need to get vaccinated and visiting
[1:04:09.520 --> 1:04:15.040]  elderly homes so how many how many how many citizens there's about nine
[1:04:15.040 --> 1:04:19.560]  million citizens in Israel how many citizens have not been is this referring
[1:04:19.560 --> 1:04:26.520]  to one million that means and there's a chance that we're out of time I'm gonna
[1:04:26.520 --> 1:04:29.760]  invite you back on sometime the next week for a full hour I really appreciate
[1:04:29.760 --> 1:04:33.680]  you but at 20 seconds they really want to put this experimental thing in us top
[1:04:33.680 --> 1:04:37.200]  scientists say it's depopulation gut level you're a smart guy what do you
[1:04:37.200 --> 1:04:45.560]  think this is I think it has to do with the population and I think it has to do
[1:04:45.560 --> 1:04:51.840]  with controlling the population that is continues to exist I agree it's a binary
[1:04:51.840 --> 1:04:55.680]  weapon they're implanting prions in you they've got a cure but you got to submit
[1:04:55.680 --> 1:05:01.360]  to them to get it we'll talk to you soon
[1:05:01.360 --> 1:05:06.480]  in Ohio welcome go ahead hey how's it going Alex the great last caller I just

[1:05:47.680 --> 1:05:55.160]  bedroom so just number one for a few only works this time Joe
[1:05:55.160 --> 1:06:02.160]  you you
[1:06:13.160 --> 1:06:19.960]  ladies and gentlemen it's the Alex Jones show Sunday edition August 15th global
[1:06:19.960 --> 1:06:23.480]  emergency transmission ice up maybe every six months so we have an emergency
[1:06:23.480 --> 1:06:27.320]  broadcast now it's every other day because we are deep in the emergency now
[1:06:27.320 --> 1:06:31.120]  they're coming for our free speech Biden's announcing plans for permanent
[1:06:31.120 --> 1:06:36.960]  martial law forced inoculations lockdowns saying that anybody that
[1:06:36.960 --> 1:06:40.360]  questions the vaccine is a terrorist that is because they're desperate it's
[1:06:40.360 --> 1:06:43.360]  because they're scared and all we got to do stand against them and these big
[1:06:43.360 --> 1:06:47.320]  corporations they're out of control and they will fail the global ruling elite
[1:06:47.320 --> 1:06:51.640]  cannot control the population anymore so they've decided to kill the population
[1:06:51.640 --> 1:06:58.560]  as the bigger presents he said at the Canadian CFR seven years ago he said
[1:06:58.560 --> 1:07:02.440]  previously it was easier to control a million than it was to kill a million
[1:07:02.440 --> 1:07:06.520]  now it is either to kill a million than to control a million and we have we have
[1:07:06.520 --> 1:07:12.600]  lost control I recommend killing and now you see the depopulation happening
[1:07:12.600 --> 1:07:19.360]  across the planet and literally seas of top scientists hospital heads Nobel
[1:07:19.360 --> 1:07:23.960]  prize winners top epidemiologists Germany's top coroner the major coroner
[1:07:23.960 --> 1:07:29.960]  association the pathologist all of them saying we cut open these people and
[1:07:29.960 --> 1:07:35.560]  they've been eaten alive by the shots and then the studies said there's
[1:07:35.560 --> 1:07:41.560]  congressional hearings we've played you the head of the Baylor Medical School
[1:07:41.560 --> 1:07:47.760]  last year said well we're working on these new vaccines but they always failed
[1:07:47.760 --> 1:07:51.960]  when they were for the coronavirus because it creates a protein and so we
[1:07:51.960 --> 1:07:55.160]  had deaths in all the human studies around the world but Bill Gates has
[1:07:55.160 --> 1:08:01.080]  picked it back up and we'll see if he can make it work and then they bypass and
[1:08:01.080 --> 1:08:06.480]  new animal trials with that particular vaccine and the deaths are massive so
[1:08:06.480 --> 1:08:11.960]  everything Dr. Heaton and Dr. Wodarg and Dr. Tenpenny and on and on and on and on
[1:08:11.960 --> 1:08:17.720]  said 14 months ago 12 months ago before the injection started from the
[1:08:17.720 --> 1:08:21.200]  literature I thought wow why are all these prestigious people saying this is
[1:08:21.200 --> 1:08:29.240]  gonna cause mass death I thought that's a little too intense even for me then they
[1:08:29.240 --> 1:08:33.520]  lied and said no side effects even though it's not approved and 90% of
[1:08:33.520 --> 1:08:37.520]  effectiveness which they now admits a fraud and then I found the documents and
[1:08:37.520 --> 1:08:40.800]  statements by Bill Gates where he said oh it's not gonna work so you're gonna
[1:08:40.800 --> 1:08:46.280]  need all these new boosters every few months and now we're here and that's why
[1:08:46.280 --> 1:08:50.920]  folks have found all the clips where I specifically predicted in February and
[1:08:50.920 --> 1:08:56.840]  March and April and so did Chris Skye of exactly what was gonna happen so to get
[1:08:56.840 --> 1:09:00.680]  his latest information on this and what he thinks is coming next Chris Skye one
[1:09:00.680 --> 1:09:04.640]  of my favorite guests is about to join us and out of all the on the ground
[1:09:04.640 --> 1:09:07.760]  activists in the world he's the most successful the most prominent the most
[1:09:07.760 --> 1:09:10.720]  accurate and I saw he was flattered a few weeks ago when I said that it's just
[1:09:10.720 --> 1:09:15.620]  true and look I'm sure he wants to be eclipsed by you this is about
[1:09:15.620 --> 1:09:20.000]  survival humans moving forward exposing medical tyranny this fifth
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:23.920]  generational warfare of depopulation that is moving against us because all
[1:09:23.920 --> 1:09:28.200]  these top scientists are saying this is gonna be a depopulation weapon and now
[1:09:28.200 --> 1:09:32.720]  it's happening and now they lied last year in the hospitals were totally
[1:09:32.720 --> 1:09:37.280]  empty the virus itself was just a gain of function thing they own now the
[1:09:37.280 --> 1:09:41.760]  sloughing now what's in the vaccine creating the prion factories and I have
[1:09:41.760 --> 1:09:46.320]  a stack of mainstream news admitting it is what's causing massive illnesses all
[1:09:46.320 --> 1:09:50.120]  over the place and when you go in they don't tell you you need ivermectin you
[1:09:50.120 --> 1:09:53.280]  need vitamin C you need zinc that's coming up at Chris guy leaves us the
[1:09:53.280 --> 1:09:57.960]  layout solutions they tell you they give you nothing in the hospital not even
[1:09:57.960 --> 1:10:05.480]  IV and they just wait until you get worse and then they put a ventilator on
[1:10:05.480 --> 1:10:08.960]  you and kill you and get fifty three thousand dollars for it so that's all
[1:10:08.960 --> 1:10:12.640]  coming up for Chris guy leaves all these top scientists laying it out but I
[1:10:12.640 --> 1:10:18.080]  wanted to show you a clip of him up in Canada and Montreal with hundreds of
[1:10:18.080 --> 1:10:21.920]  thousands marching will roll that footage for TV viewers now hundreds of
[1:10:21.920 --> 1:10:25.480]  thousands marching to the streets there's hours of this footage all the
[1:10:25.480 --> 1:10:30.760]  world giant demonstrations and then I want to roll for you just a little clip
[1:10:30.760 --> 1:10:35.480]  of him on the ground and all these beautiful people of every race color
[1:10:35.480 --> 1:10:40.000]  and creed and gender together waking up to what's happening we'll talk to Chris
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:43.960]  guy in a moment but here's Chris guy I guess this is just yesterday in the
[1:10:43.960 --> 1:10:50.360]  streets of Canada an insane turnout in Montreal I haven't gone live yet because
[1:10:50.360 --> 1:10:53.760]  my battery would die I'm gonna live when I speak so everybody stand by for the
[1:10:53.760 --> 1:11:09.120]  life and that's always the sign of the winning group and you've got all the
[1:11:09.120 --> 1:11:13.080]  lovely ladies as well so there he is with Elvis with the women grabbing at him
[1:11:13.080 --> 1:11:17.040]  and people women should be grabbing at dudes like this this is what men are
[1:11:17.040 --> 1:11:21.200]  supposed to do not act tough not be like Schwarzenegger screw your freedom
[1:11:21.200 --> 1:11:23.960]  Schwarzenegger said back in pumping iron they cut it out of the movie but
[1:11:23.960 --> 1:11:28.400]  some Rolling Stone I love Hitler I love authoritarianism screw everyone screw
[1:11:28.400 --> 1:11:33.840]  you baby Hitler and your dad gooseed off the SS officer I can't wait till Arnold
[1:11:33.840 --> 1:11:37.440]  Schwarzenegger is dead in the ground and I feel that Nazi piece of crap is out
[1:11:37.440 --> 1:11:40.600]  of America I'm not gonna kill him I'm not gonna hurt him I just can't wait till
[1:11:40.600 --> 1:11:45.120]  his fascist ass is six feet under burning hell Arnold Schwarzenegger get out
[1:11:45.120 --> 1:11:50.240]  of America you trash my grandfather's kicked your dad's ass you piece of shit
[1:11:50.240 --> 1:11:56.480]  fuck you Arnold Schwarzenegger burn in fucking hell you Nazi excuse me Chris
[1:11:56.480 --> 1:12:01.600]  guy good to have you on with us here on the Sunday edition wow tell me about the
[1:12:01.600 --> 1:12:06.360]  great footage we just saw and more and what's happening around the world sorry
[1:12:06.360 --> 1:12:10.400]  that was like the my favorite segue I think I've ever gotten well we got a lot
[1:12:10.400 --> 1:12:14.800]  going on as you saw I was in Montreal yesterday I showed up we drove all night
[1:12:14.800 --> 1:12:19.480]  and I was promoting that like crazy I literally was threatening people to go
[1:12:19.480 --> 1:12:22.800]  that get off their ass and go there because it was all about stopping the
[1:12:22.800 --> 1:12:28.320]  Vax pass and the Vax pass is already a law now in Montreal and Quebec and just
[1:12:28.320 --> 1:12:32.120]  like your the previous guest dated from Israel it bores you from all what they
[1:12:32.120 --> 1:12:36.120]  call non-essential activities which is absolutely ridiculous because at the
[1:12:36.120 --> 1:12:39.760]  same time they're telling you you have a choice and it's not a mandate the idea
[1:12:39.760 --> 1:12:43.520]  of a choice means you can make a choice without consequences if you make a choice
[1:12:43.520 --> 1:12:47.440]  and the choice is you lose virtually all your rights and freedoms then it's not
[1:12:47.440 --> 1:12:51.280]  really much of a choice is it this is all about coercion of the Vax and that's
[1:12:51.280 --> 1:12:54.400]  why you're going to see in the next couple of weeks and months every type
[1:12:54.400 --> 1:12:56.920]  of industry trying to mandate it they're going to try to mandate it for
[1:12:56.920 --> 1:12:59.200]  front-line work they're going to try to mandate it for teachers are going to try
[1:12:59.200 --> 1:13:04.800]  to mandate it for students etc so we saw as you saw hundreds of thousands of
[1:13:04.800 --> 1:13:12.200]  people came out all shapes all sizes all genders all races all ethnicities all
[1:13:12.200 --> 1:13:17.320]  religions all there for one reason preserving our rights and freedoms that
[1:13:17.320 --> 1:13:21.320]  these politicians are trying to take from us and what do we see we saw in one
[1:13:21.320 --> 1:13:25.000]  small city just like I said back in May when we got another couple hundred
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:30.120]  thousand there is when we call on the people the people will come and what we
[1:13:30.120 --> 1:13:36.160]  saw was enough people to do whatever we want to do if those people took off their
[1:13:36.160 --> 1:13:39.800]  masks and opened their business and said no to the jab just that many people in
[1:13:39.800 --> 1:13:43.880]  that one city this agenda would stop in its track and that's what I'm about to say
[1:13:43.880 --> 1:13:47.280]  you pointed out we don't need leaders we have to be the leaders but can you imagine
[1:13:47.280 --> 1:13:54.080]  if a governor of Texas a governor of Arizona a governor of Florida led an
[1:13:54.080 --> 1:14:00.240]  anti-lockdown March how big it would be I mean imagine and that's why we're
[1:14:00.240 --> 1:14:03.160]  trying to that's what that's why I'm trying to tell everybody there's no such
[1:14:03.160 --> 1:14:06.680]  thing as a political freedom movement and there's or there's either a political
[1:14:06.680 --> 1:14:10.080]  movement or a freedom movement and we have politicians they're like Maxine
[1:14:10.080 --> 1:14:13.640]  Bernier and he literally tried to march to the front of the pack with their
[1:14:13.640 --> 1:14:17.480]  little PPC sign to pretend like all those people came there from him and I
[1:14:17.480 --> 1:14:20.120]  actually walked to the front and I talked to him on a megaphone I started
[1:14:20.120 --> 1:14:24.080]  exposing all his last 20 years of globalism and he first he tried to take
[1:14:24.080 --> 1:14:27.000]  the megaphone out of my hand and then when he realized that wasn't a good idea
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:31.720]  he literally just put his head down and ran off like every other politician
[1:14:31.720 --> 1:14:35.000]  I gave him a call the nobody calls these people
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:38.560]  oh of course I got a call them all because you pretend freedom fighter I
[1:14:38.560 --> 1:14:42.120]  don't have to call out true though we're in this mess because of him we know what
[1:14:42.120 --> 1:14:45.240]  true though will run the country like we're living in it Maxine is the one
[1:14:45.240 --> 1:14:48.560]  that's pretending like if you vote for him he's gonna change things but if you
[1:14:48.560 --> 1:14:52.160]  just he just wants your money and your support and as soon as you give a
[1:14:52.160 --> 1:14:55.520]  politician your support and you sit back down on the couch and you're no longer
[1:14:55.520 --> 1:14:58.280]  ready to take action they've just nullified you and that's what they're
[1:14:58.280 --> 1:15:03.440]  doing stopping paralyzed the people have to lead we have to start marching and
[1:15:03.440 --> 1:15:06.920]  demonstrating it's happening all over the world and I want Americans to start
[1:15:06.920 --> 1:15:09.800]  doing it which is happening in California and New York and other areas
[1:15:09.800 --> 1:15:13.240]  but listen Texas and South Dakota and Florida better do it because they're
[1:15:13.240 --> 1:15:18.920]  coming after us and we now proven these so-called vaccines turn your body into a
[1:15:18.920 --> 1:15:25.840]  a cry on mad cow disease factory this is insane so I'm saying 100% it's
[1:15:25.840 --> 1:15:29.640]  literally beyond insanity because if you look all around the world beyond our
[1:15:29.640 --> 1:15:33.960]  borders look at Iceland they have almost 100% of the adult population
[1:15:33.960 --> 1:15:37.760]  vaccinated against COVID and they're having a massive outbreak in the middle
[1:15:37.760 --> 1:15:41.960]  of summer and the vast majority of cases are from the vaccinated if we look at
[1:15:41.960 --> 1:15:46.840]  Singapore they admit 75% of the cases are vaccinated and if we look at my own
[1:15:46.840 --> 1:15:53.360]  home my own hometown of Ontario Canada if you look at our ICU zero patients in
[1:15:53.360 --> 1:15:58.480]  the ICU are non-jab stay there this is key stay with us for only one week we're

[1:16:57.280 --> 1:17:01.520]  when I first started taking survival skills basically I was 275 pounds I was
[1:17:01.520 --> 1:17:05.320]  overweight I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe I was barely holding
[1:17:05.320 --> 1:17:09.160]  on to a job and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it so the
[1:17:09.160 --> 1:17:12.760]  first one I got was the original survival shield the X1 and it worked
[1:17:12.760 --> 1:17:16.120]  pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out with that too you had you
[1:17:16.120 --> 1:17:18.960]  know with a deep burden source you know and I got really excited about that so I
[1:17:18.960 --> 1:17:23.960]  took it and then in two weeks I went from brain fog to like literally like my
[1:17:23.960 --> 1:17:28.640]  brain was enlightened you know I could think again I could connect with people
[1:17:28.640 --> 1:17:32.720]  again and over the course of the next couple of years I got my health back
[1:17:32.720 --> 1:17:35.960]  and I religiously take basically all of your supplements there they're all
[1:17:35.960 --> 1:17:40.320]  absolutely amazing supplements the one I like recently is knockout it literally
[1:17:40.320 --> 1:17:43.880]  like if you want to sleep just take it it's amazing it works but anyway so the
[1:17:43.880 --> 1:17:47.840]  point is we have to get ourselves clean we have to break free of the globalist
[1:17:47.840 --> 1:17:51.680]  system and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hand
[1:17:51.680 --> 1:17:57.560]  beautifully said brother I thank you so much for your call and God speed I have
[1:17:57.560 --> 1:18:01.040]  gotten so many requests and so many complaints from listeners in the last

[1:20:21.120 --> 1:20:37.880]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[1:20:37.880 --> 1:20:45.000]  hi chris sky on the top activist in the world fighting tyranny on the ground a
[1:20:45.000 --> 1:20:48.680]  hundred man and 11 ever minute of it that cut off of the break you were
[1:20:48.680 --> 1:20:53.240]  getting into you already blew people away over a year ago and then a year ago
[1:20:53.240 --> 1:20:57.480]  with your prediction of exactly what would happen recap that and then give us
[1:20:57.480 --> 1:21:00.280]  your latest prediction and then get into with all the evidence of all the
[1:21:00.280 --> 1:21:04.240]  science what this is because clearly before the hospitals are empty i'm
[1:21:04.240 --> 1:21:09.240]  seeing all over the u.s. devastation now for people close to folks that had the
[1:21:09.240 --> 1:21:13.200]  shot and those that have the shot all the world you know the vast majority
[1:21:13.200 --> 1:21:17.280]  seriously sick are those that have the injection just an incredible move
[1:21:17.280 --> 1:21:20.920]  premeditated the studies show they knew this would happen but you have a way
[1:21:20.920 --> 1:21:25.760]  with words crystallize it for us chris guy very quickly the last thing i said
[1:21:25.760 --> 1:21:30.600]  before we got cut off was in my hometown all the people in the icu have been
[1:21:30.600 --> 1:21:34.680]  vaccinated there is not one person in the icu in ontario canada that has not
[1:21:34.680 --> 1:21:37.520]  been vaccinated what does that tell you that should tell you everything you need
[1:21:37.520 --> 1:21:41.520]  to know the vaccine is the problem the vaccine is what's causing the disease and
[1:21:41.520 --> 1:21:45.040]  they're using it to divide society they're going to use it to weaken society
[1:21:45.040 --> 1:21:47.880]  they're going to use it to lock us down again we're in the middle of predicted
[1:21:47.880 --> 1:21:51.200]  programming they told us all we're not going to have a vaccine passport the
[1:21:51.200 --> 1:21:55.720]  very next day they said the opposite thing and now every other day we get a
[1:21:55.720 --> 1:21:59.120]  new story that promotes the narrative and what do i mean by that we see stories
[1:21:59.120 --> 1:22:02.680]  that say oh there's new variants that's resistant to the vaccine a way to make
[1:22:02.680 --> 1:22:06.600]  an excuse for the vaccinated getting sick oh the unvaccinated are dangerous the
[1:22:06.600 --> 1:22:09.760]  unvaccinated are terrorists the unvaccinated need to be controlled then
[1:22:09.760 --> 1:22:13.760]  in september when everybody takes their third shot they're gonna get even more
[1:22:13.760 --> 1:22:17.080]  sick and when all these people start getting sick they're gonna make an
[1:22:17.080 --> 1:22:20.320]  excuse to lock us down again in canada they're calling a snap election in
[1:22:20.320 --> 1:22:23.800]  in in september just out of the blue tridoles calling an election because he
[1:22:23.800 --> 1:22:27.080]  knows he's gonna win as soon as he wins that election they're gonna claim the
[1:22:27.080 --> 1:22:31.160]  rising cases and the new variant which is caused by the unvaccinated is a
[1:22:31.160 --> 1:22:34.960]  disaster they're gonna lock society down again then they're gonna implement the
[1:22:34.960 --> 1:22:38.840]  vaccine passport not just in Quebec which is why I was there yesterday they're
[1:22:38.840 --> 1:22:43.160]  gonna implement the canada wide as a way to try to coerce everybody to get this
[1:22:43.160 --> 1:22:46.600]  vaccination because as you get it like you said every time you get it you're
[1:22:46.600 --> 1:22:49.720]  getting yourself weaker you're getting yourself more sick and more dependent on
[1:22:49.720 --> 1:22:53.560]  the vaccine so virtually every round they vaccinate people you're gonna get a
[1:22:53.560 --> 1:22:56.560]  whole lot of deaths you're gonna go a whole lot of all different all the types
[1:22:56.560 --> 1:22:59.400]  of side effects and every four to six months they're gonna do the same thing
[1:22:59.400 --> 1:23:05.240]  that's 100% about depopulation 100% about control of the rest of us and if
[1:23:05.240 --> 1:23:08.640]  you're sick you can't really fight back can you so it makes them it makes them
[1:23:08.640 --> 1:23:11.720]  beautiful and for the people that aren't sick and healthy they turn you into
[1:23:11.720 --> 1:23:15.440]  criminals and they set the stage to not only control you but eventually round
[1:23:15.440 --> 1:23:18.680]  you up and put you in those camps that everybody pretends don't exist but
[1:23:18.680 --> 1:23:22.760]  actually do exist and that's the key that's where I'm going here it is
[1:23:22.760 --> 1:23:27.240]  national strategy for counter domestic terrorism same garbage in England same
[1:23:27.240 --> 1:23:32.240]  garbage in Germany France same thing Australian New Zealand everywhere it's
[1:23:32.240 --> 1:23:36.080]  exactly the same all out of the UN as you exposed last year authorities won't
[1:23:36.080 --> 1:23:39.520]  hesitate to go door-to-door to perform COVID tests on unvaccinated
[1:23:39.520 --> 1:23:44.440]  Australians their premiers are saying a major mayor called it Hitler and said
[1:23:44.440 --> 1:23:48.720]  it's like Hitler's taken over Canada I'll read that so they're finally fighting
[1:23:48.720 --> 1:23:52.680]  back and getting what's happening but this has been the plan blame the
[1:23:52.680 --> 1:23:58.400]  unvaccinated the uninjected the entire time Chris Sky so so talk about talk
[1:23:58.400 --> 1:24:03.760]  about that and Biden and Biden now putting out this weekend opposition to
[1:24:03.760 --> 1:24:11.880]  COVID measures is the top terror threat in the United States so they got to say
[1:24:11.880 --> 1:24:15.120]  that opposition to the COVID stuff is terrorism because that way they can label
[1:24:15.120 --> 1:24:17.920]  anybody like you or me a terrorist and then they can do whatever they want to
[1:24:17.920 --> 1:24:22.280]  us without any laws they could silence us they could take our rights away they
[1:24:22.280 --> 1:24:25.040]  could put us in prison hell they can even kill us if they want to if we're
[1:24:25.040 --> 1:24:28.360]  that bad of Paris so that's gonna be the new narrative anybody speaking out as
[1:24:28.360 --> 1:24:31.440]  terrorist because speaking out is what stops them speaking out is what gets
[1:24:31.440 --> 1:24:34.920]  all the people aware all the people ready to go there are so many people
[1:24:34.920 --> 1:24:38.160]  awake in Canada I can't even walk down the street without groups of people
[1:24:38.160 --> 1:24:41.160]  coming up to me and understanding exactly what's going on and there's other
[1:24:41.160 --> 1:24:44.280]  way I gotta I gotta call out somebody right now real quick the international
[1:24:44.280 --> 1:24:48.960]  COVID summit taking place in Italy I was invited there I was invited there months
[1:24:48.960 --> 1:24:52.520]  ago they made me promote it two weeks ago they made me register for the event as
[1:24:52.520 --> 1:24:56.360]  a speaker I have all the evidence of this they made me go on a zoom chat and
[1:24:56.360 --> 1:24:58.880]  they told me that I was gonna be the representative Canada I was gonna be
[1:24:58.880 --> 1:25:03.160]  speaking for 15 minutes and I was gonna be getting an award I said great sounds
[1:25:03.160 --> 1:25:07.000]  fantastic they told me to start booking my flight I was supposed to be there on
[1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:11.360]  the 13th of September then I get a call it started getting pressure from
[1:25:11.360 --> 1:25:14.720]  somebody as soon as they heard I was allowed to speak they call me back and
[1:25:14.720 --> 1:25:19.760]  they said you're not allowed to talk about the vaccine I said okay because the
[1:25:19.760 --> 1:25:22.360]  whole summits about alternative treatments so I said that's fine I'll
[1:25:22.360 --> 1:25:25.400]  talk about the alternative treatment so with the so the alternative treatments
[1:25:25.400 --> 1:25:28.860]  being so good we don't need the vaccine they said that's great then they call
[1:25:28.860 --> 1:25:32.400]  me back about an hour later we go we haven't had another zoom chat I said okay
[1:25:32.400 --> 1:25:36.240]  they said well you're not allowed to say anything about the vaccine and you're
[1:25:36.240 --> 1:25:40.320]  also not allowed to discuss any form of government civil disobedience so you're
[1:25:40.320 --> 1:25:43.880]  not allowed to even use your kit phrase united not right they use these events
[1:25:43.880 --> 1:25:47.080]  as a mode to get control of activists let's just stop right there this is all
[1:25:47.080 --> 1:25:50.640]  a test to see if you get money but let's just stop before we go there because
[1:25:50.640 --> 1:25:53.880]  you're too important we're what we're doing so important even get into all the
[1:25:53.880 --> 1:25:59.160]  stuff explain to people though if we take the shots at the court of our immune
[1:25:59.160 --> 1:26:02.000]  system even the Pfizer rep admits that it's all the planning of our immune
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:06.240]  system takeover have the digital passports the holy grail of control
[1:26:06.240 --> 1:26:11.120]  glass swab admits it all let's get back into how we defeat them and I see their
[1:26:11.120 --> 1:26:16.760]  declaration there is terrorist as a sign of weakness Chris very yes they're so
[1:26:16.760 --> 1:26:19.400]  desperate that's why they're going to terrorism angle that's why they're going
[1:26:19.400 --> 1:26:21.600]  this angle where you're not going to be able to do anything unless you get
[1:26:21.600 --> 1:26:24.120]  vaccinated and they're doing it all at once because they want to create a
[1:26:24.120 --> 1:26:28.560]  perfect storm and overwhelm us why because we're waking people up way faster
[1:26:28.560 --> 1:26:31.880]  than they could have ever anticipated and not only are people awake they are
[1:26:31.880 --> 1:26:36.680]  pissed off I know people that are double jabbed wear masks and the last thing
[1:26:36.680 --> 1:26:41.560]  they want is a vaccine passport so all you got to do it's very simple you have
[1:26:41.560 --> 1:26:46.120]  go on strike if you're a police officer doctor lawyer frontline worker nurse
[1:26:46.120 --> 1:26:51.240]  teacher student etc they try to mandate it you just don't show up to work you
[1:26:51.240 --> 1:26:54.880]  don't show up to school it's that simple and you march in the streets every
[1:26:54.880 --> 1:26:59.280]  single day to cry your government in front of the world until they put up and
[1:26:59.280 --> 1:27:03.480]  shut up because guess what that's what United non-compliance is it's about
[1:27:03.480 --> 1:27:08.160]  power to the people and what is our the real problem in our country is that
[1:27:08.160 --> 1:27:12.960]  every single one of our writings in our country are occupied by politicians
[1:27:12.960 --> 1:27:16.480]  these are public sector workers these are not people that got affected by the
[1:27:16.480 --> 1:27:20.200]  lockdown these are people that will support lockdowns because they get paid
[1:27:20.200 --> 1:27:24.360]  no matter what so that's the problem with our country right now it's being
[1:27:24.360 --> 1:27:28.360]  run by politicians and I'm on my way to Calgary to an award show on the 19th and
[1:27:28.360 --> 1:27:33.120]  on the 20th I'm having an event it's a private event in Edmonton I posted it on
[1:27:33.120 --> 1:27:38.680]  all my social media anybody in Canada that's got money power resources and
[1:27:38.680 --> 1:27:42.800]  wants to see this end and is finally ready to get off their ass get off the
[1:27:42.800 --> 1:27:46.680]  sidelines and fight then you show up there because what's coming next besides
[1:27:46.680 --> 1:27:50.600]  these lockdowns besides these camps besides all of that they're gonna have

[1:28:01.440 --> 1:28:04.080]  you out of existence and you're gonna become the next terrorist so you better
[1:28:04.080 --> 1:28:07.520]  stand with me now before it's too late business owners that aren't affected

[1:28:18.800 --> 1:28:22.360]  break and you made a little two-minute prediction I totally agree with it I
[1:28:22.360 --> 1:28:25.800]  want to give you the floor for at least five minutes when I come back to give
[1:28:25.800 --> 1:28:31.120]  us the next super viral Chris guy lay it all out you're you're you're a
[1:28:31.120 --> 1:28:34.920]  charismatic guy and we don't have enough people like you and people are
[1:28:34.920 --> 1:28:37.680]  listening to you or listen to me and only a few others but you're right up
[1:28:37.680 --> 1:28:41.480]  there at the top now we love you it's like Tucker Carlson myself you David Ike

[1:28:51.280 --> 1:28:58.040]  happening and why we've got to stop it and how we stop it stay with us so what's
[1:28:58.040 --> 1:29:01.120]  the most important part let's say in a bulldozer running over the globalist the
[1:29:01.120 --> 1:29:05.560]  treads the wheels the engine the scoop on the front it's all very important but
[1:29:05.560 --> 1:29:10.840]  the fuel is paramount and that's my allegory turbo force is vitamins
[1:29:10.840 --> 1:29:14.200]  minerals amino acids that synergistically work with six different
[1:29:14.200 --> 1:29:18.080]  natural forms of healthy clean energy that lasts for 10 hours in the average
[1:29:18.080 --> 1:29:21.640]  metabolic system metabolism of a human some people get 15 hours out of them
[1:29:21.640 --> 1:29:24.800]  look at about eight hours but people take this people taking sports people

[1:30:59.080 --> 1:31:03.600]  say to the mid 1990s and then imagine a science fiction movie set in the year
[1:31:03.600 --> 1:31:08.520]  2020 where a world government's being established where members of Congress and
[1:31:08.520 --> 1:31:12.240]  former presidents are censored by big tech and where if you don't take an
[1:31:12.240 --> 1:31:18.080]  experimental injection that grows blood plots and prions all over your body that
[1:31:18.080 --> 1:31:23.200]  you're not allowed to fly on an airplane think about that because that's where we
[1:31:23.200 --> 1:31:28.640]  are imagine just 20 30 years ago tell just five years ago if somebody told you
[1:31:28.640 --> 1:31:33.680]  this would be happening but it is happening now and then they tell you oh
[1:31:33.680 --> 1:31:37.520]  sorry it's not a vaccine is a gene therapy and it doesn't really work she
[1:31:37.520 --> 1:31:41.360]  got to take it every few months and the people that have submitted say great I
[1:31:41.360 --> 1:31:45.800]  want to take it all the time so I can go outside and not get sick from COVID even
[1:31:45.800 --> 1:31:48.840]  though it gets you sick from COVID and now there's record numbers of really
[1:31:48.840 --> 1:31:52.680]  sick people from the sloughing the shedding of the virus and that's in
[1:31:52.680 --> 1:31:59.040]  mainline studies Bill Gates and Fauci did this need to go to prison for it right now you
[1:31:59.040 --> 1:32:02.560]  say you want to fight tyranny you say you want to fund the second American

[1:33:22.440 --> 1:33:45.640]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen well the incredible thing is we have now lived
[1:33:45.640 --> 1:33:50.440]  long enough to be in the main new world order depopulation assault and we are
[1:33:50.440 --> 1:33:56.520]  gonna see major collapse major war major death and that's why they're so
[1:33:56.520 --> 1:34:00.640]  desperate to inject everybody they can up front because they want to be able to
[1:34:00.640 --> 1:34:04.360]  wipe out as many people get as many people sick as they can before it comes
[1:34:04.360 --> 1:34:08.920]  out they've done this and then they've got other backup plans but instead 23%
[1:34:08.920 --> 1:34:13.760]  of Australia 20% of Saudi Arabia I mean most the world less than 10% of
[1:34:13.760 --> 1:34:18.680]  India they're not dumb the Chinese aren't taking these shots this was for
[1:34:18.680 --> 1:34:25.480]  Canada this was for the UK this was for Australia New Zealand for America because
[1:34:25.480 --> 1:34:31.080]  of the Anglo-Saxon ethos it's not all white people around the world that
[1:34:31.080 --> 1:34:35.000]  rebel and fight and demand freedom like what happened on the British Isles and
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:40.040]  this is not a white supremacist statement it the globalists talk about
[1:34:40.040 --> 1:34:43.400]  getting rid of Magna Carta getting rid of the Bill of Rights getting rid of the
[1:34:43.400 --> 1:34:49.680]  Constitution getting rid of the Arthurian idea that began with a round table
[1:34:49.680 --> 1:34:54.000]  where a king actually listened to his knights and was not at the head of the
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:35:00.680]  table that is an archetype for the Magna Carta almost a thousand years ago
[1:35:00.680 --> 1:35:05.920]  you understand and so out of that came juries and grand juries and due process
[1:35:05.920 --> 1:35:09.960]  and that a man's home was his castle that a woman's home was their castle and
[1:35:09.960 --> 1:35:15.120]  all the freedoms we have were paid for by that and what did Tony Blair say back
[1:35:15.120 --> 1:35:19.720]  when he was Prime Minister like 1998 he had the headline BBC my goal was to
[1:35:19.720 --> 1:35:27.600]  abolish Magna Carta Magna Carta is what private property and due process you
[1:35:27.600 --> 1:35:31.680]  think things aren't perfect wait till that's gone so they're in direct war
[1:35:31.680 --> 1:35:36.440]  with that and so it is Western society and everybody that lives here you can be
[1:35:36.440 --> 1:35:41.480]  black you could be brown you could be black but because you live in a Christian
[1:35:41.480 --> 1:35:47.640]  Arthurian country despite all the evil because the Arthurian idea created all
[1:35:47.640 --> 1:35:52.800]  the power so of course evil came and took it over the Rothschilds and others but
[1:35:52.800 --> 1:35:59.920]  it is the Arthurian spirit that created this massive wealth and power and so they
[1:35:59.920 --> 1:36:03.840]  are seeking to overthrow it and kill it and poison it because the rest of the
[1:36:03.840 --> 1:36:06.960]  world is not being targeted Africa is being targeted for experimentation and
[1:36:06.960 --> 1:36:10.680]  then the Western world is we're the main target I don't know all the answers but
[1:36:10.680 --> 1:36:14.720]  Africa is being targeted and the Western world is being targeted why is that
[1:36:14.720 --> 1:36:18.400]  Chris Scott you've got the floor of the balance of this segment you have six and
[1:36:18.400 --> 1:36:23.880]  a half minutes tell us lay it all out okay so first I'll tell you why we're
[1:36:23.880 --> 1:36:27.040]  the target then I'm gonna give you two scenarios what happens if we keep
[1:36:27.040 --> 1:36:30.880]  complying and what happens if we employ united non-compliance and on that last
[1:36:30.880 --> 1:36:34.240]  thing is how we do that so the first thing is why are they targeting the
[1:36:34.240 --> 1:36:37.280]  Western worlds because of what you said we're the basis of civilizations
[1:36:37.280 --> 1:36:40.600]  freedoms we're the basis of the capitalist society and it became the most
[1:36:40.600 --> 1:36:44.520]  successful society where the individual actually can attain wealth and power and
[1:36:44.520 --> 1:36:47.200]  that's what they don't want they don't want the individual to have wealth and
[1:36:47.200 --> 1:36:50.280]  power because then they can't have total control and they already have enough
[1:36:50.280 --> 1:36:53.560]  money and when you have that kind of money what do you want control so they're
[1:36:53.560 --> 1:36:57.600]  doing everything that they're doing to us now for control that's the number one
[1:36:57.600 --> 1:37:00.680]  point you got to get through to everyone's head that isn't a wig it's a
[1:37:00.680 --> 1:37:03.040]  bulk control
[1:37:06.320 --> 1:37:10.440]  okay Chris guy was absolutely kicking ass we're going to next segment we have to
[1:37:10.440 --> 1:37:16.200]  reconnect with him right now because he's alright cuz I want I want him to lay
[1:37:16.200 --> 1:37:19.560]  this out people really listen to him and he's dead on he's a smart guy that's why
[1:37:19.560 --> 1:37:23.520]  I get thousands of messages don't talk to Chris guy he's bad oh my same message
[1:37:23.520 --> 1:37:26.480]  you get about me oh don't promote Alex Jones don't be embarrassed to him oh
[1:37:26.480 --> 1:37:32.080]  don't he's not real oh he's he knew they were gonna declare the anti-vaxxers
[1:37:32.080 --> 1:37:35.000]  terrorist because he's one of them no they put a damn report out two months
[1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:40.040]  ago I told you where I want you to know what I know it's all right there the
[1:37:40.040 --> 1:37:46.440]  enemy is admitting all of this they're throwing it all in your face and one way
[1:37:46.440 --> 1:37:50.480]  or the other we're gonna get Chris guy's testimony on here but of course you
[1:37:50.480 --> 1:37:55.920]  know I say give us the give us the download and he can say it as good as I
[1:37:55.920 --> 1:38:01.240]  can he's back okay we'll have to hold him the net but you you you got cut off
[1:38:01.240 --> 1:38:04.840]  right when you were said the Western civilization is under attack because we
[1:38:04.840 --> 1:38:11.520]  have the answer to empower the individual please continue okay so what we
[1:38:11.520 --> 1:38:15.520]  got was power to the individual is what they want to eliminate so if we don't
[1:38:15.520 --> 1:38:19.840]  employ united non-compliance and we keep complying with the agenda as we've been
[1:38:19.840 --> 1:38:23.960]  doing every round of vaccine is like their next checkpoint that's where they
[1:38:23.960 --> 1:38:26.880]  kill off a whole bunch of people get in a whole bunch of people sick try to
[1:38:26.880 --> 1:38:30.480]  conform a whole bunch of other people and try to push a bunch more draconian
[1:38:30.480 --> 1:38:36.040]  laws Canada US are the targets the rest of the world will follow if you do come
[1:38:36.040 --> 1:38:41.360]  if you keep complying we're gonna have vaccine passports we're gonna have door
[1:38:41.360 --> 1:38:44.920]  to door we're gonna have military on the streets we're gonna have unvaxxed
[1:38:44.920 --> 1:38:48.560]  going to camps we're gonna have the biggest divide in society we've ever
[1:38:48.560 --> 1:38:51.440]  seen and we're gonna have the permanent loss of our rights and freedoms
[1:38:51.440 --> 1:38:55.760]  enshrined into our lives that's going to be combined with a digital passport a
[1:38:55.760 --> 1:39:00.280]  digital currency and a digital identity which gives them total control of you
[1:39:00.280 --> 1:39:04.000]  that takes you from an individual that once had power and could attain wealth
[1:39:04.000 --> 1:39:08.240]  to us a insignificant blip on a screen that they could eliminate with the flick
[1:39:08.240 --> 1:39:12.840]  of a switch and that's what they plan to do to many of us because don't be don't
[1:39:12.840 --> 1:39:17.480]  be fooled our jobs are no longer necessary they can be done by computers
[1:39:17.480 --> 1:39:20.520]  and there's way too many of us they call you useless eaters that's what happens
[1:39:20.520 --> 1:39:24.760]  if you comply if you don't comply we could have a golden or what they're
[1:39:24.760 --> 1:39:30.960]  gonna call a crystal age of society one where the people have total control over
[1:39:30.960 --> 1:39:34.400]  their lives one where we have a much higher standard of living with a much
[1:39:34.400 --> 1:39:39.080]  lower cost of living much less stress much less centralized control and that
[1:39:39.080 --> 1:39:43.440]  and much less control of resources from a few people this is what they don't want
[1:39:43.440 --> 1:39:48.120]  because they lose their wealth they lose their power but we will all get a taste
[1:39:48.120 --> 1:39:51.800]  of the good life that they've been enjoying so how do we do this it's called
[1:39:51.800 --> 1:39:58.200]  united non-compliance and that's simple unite and don't comply
[1:39:59.280 --> 1:40:03.480]  Chris guy is on fire as usual we're gonna reconnect with him have him turn
[1:40:03.480 --> 1:40:07.000]  off some stuff on that laptop where he's sitting in that backyard that front
[1:40:07.000 --> 1:40:10.160]  yard and we're gonna get him on next segment because what he's saying is so
[1:40:10.160 --> 1:40:13.600]  key we're gonna clip all this together in a special report we put out because
[1:40:13.600 --> 1:40:18.520]  he's absolutely right they know that they have all this free technology all
[1:40:18.520 --> 1:40:22.000]  this free energy technology but the globalists are trying to suppress that
[1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:27.760]  they know we have that and so they need to clamp down dump people down create a
[1:40:27.760 --> 1:40:34.480]  new dark age a new middle ages now to keep us from getting this and that's
[1:40:34.480 --> 1:40:39.920]  what the whole sustainable development smart cities just think Nazis but think
[1:40:39.920 --> 1:40:43.960]  beyond Nazis think absolutely being starved being controlled and they're

[1:43:05.080 --> 1:43:10.200]  grade and we had this history teacher that had us write a paper on the man in
[1:43:10.200 --> 1:43:14.040]  the arena and I just remember thinking about that saying I want to be the man
[1:43:14.040 --> 1:43:17.720]  in the arena but when it comes to media info wars has been the tip of that
[1:43:17.720 --> 1:43:22.760]  spear but Mike Lindell has come along and done just as good a job as we've done
[1:43:22.760 --> 1:43:26.960]  maybe even better when it comes to election fraud and other issues and

[1:43:57.520 --> 1:44:02.360]  through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies
[1:44:02.360 --> 1:44:06.760]  we are told and the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher
[1:44:06.760 --> 1:44:11.880]  senses which is why fluoridated water is a big problem consuming too much
[1:44:11.880 --> 1:44:16.560]  fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland and shuts down its
[1:44:16.560 --> 1:44:21.200]  natural functions natural functions which have been known for millennia the

[1:46:00.240 --> 1:46:04.360]  basically I was 275 pounds I was overweight I had brain fog like you
[1:46:04.360 --> 1:46:08.600]  wouldn't believe I was barely holding on to a job and I heard Dr. Group on your
[1:46:08.600 --> 1:46:11.920]  show and I listened to it so the first one I got was the original survival
[1:46:11.920 --> 1:46:15.840]  shield the X1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out
[1:46:15.840 --> 1:46:18.680]  with that too you have you know with a deep burden source you know and I got
[1:46:18.680 --> 1:46:22.640]  really excited about that so I took it and man in two weeks I went from brain
[1:46:22.640 --> 1:46:27.920]  fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened you know I could think again
[1:46:27.920 --> 1:46:32.120]  I could connect with people again and over the course of the next couple of
[1:46:32.120 --> 1:46:35.640]  years I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your
[1:46:35.640 --> 1:46:38.840]  supplements they're they're all absolutely amazing supplements the one I
[1:46:38.840 --> 1:46:42.600]  like recently is knockout it literally like if you want to sleep just take it
[1:46:42.600 --> 1:46:46.440]  it's amazing it works but anyway so the point is we have to get ourselves clean
[1:46:46.440 --> 1:46:50.280]  that's a break free of the globalist system and the only way to do that is to
[1:46:50.280 --> 1:46:54.560]  take our own health into our own hand beautifully said brother I thank you so
[1:46:54.560 --> 1:47:05.560]  much your call and Godspeed you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:47:09.640 --> 1:47:18.520]  we are on the March the Empire is on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[1:47:18.520 --> 1:47:27.640]  network the globalist like all other tyrants have taken the fact that
[1:47:27.640 --> 1:47:32.960]  humanity's been asleep as a sign of weakness they will find as the human
[1:47:32.960 --> 1:47:38.620]  spirit rises they won't be facing one Alex Jones they'll be facing millions of
[1:47:38.620 --> 1:47:44.080]  us and we've got black skin we got white skin we got brown skin we got red
[1:47:44.080 --> 1:47:50.560]  blood and we are ready for victory against their tyranny and we are
[1:47:50.560 --> 1:47:56.080]  awakening now so Chris guy doing a great job great activism is tearing all
[1:47:56.080 --> 1:48:02.160]  the world predicting and all the amazing accuracy repeatedly had a Skype cutout
[1:48:02.160 --> 1:48:06.400]  is on the side of the road to gas station he wants to start over with his
[1:48:06.400 --> 1:48:11.680]  analysis of what's coming next and how to stop it Chris guy let us have it we
[1:48:11.680 --> 1:48:15.320]  got it on phone now so we got backup audio so this time they can't cut us
[1:48:15.320 --> 1:48:22.000]  out so we got so we got two people you either comply or you don't comply if
[1:48:22.000 --> 1:48:29.200]  you comply this goes vaccine to vaccine which each one for them is a checkpoint
[1:48:29.200 --> 1:48:35.040]  people dead more laws broken more freedoms taken until we're rounded up in
[1:48:35.040 --> 1:48:39.360]  camps and we're relegated to a little blip on a screen that they can just flip
[1:48:39.360 --> 1:48:44.360]  a switch and we're gone individual freedom gone individual wealth gone the
[1:48:44.360 --> 1:48:48.600]  ability for the individual to move up through society gone and then when they
[1:48:48.600 --> 1:48:51.720]  have that kind of control they just gonna eliminate a whole bunch of us
[1:48:51.720 --> 1:48:54.920]  because they don't need those useless eaters that's what happens if you
[1:48:54.920 --> 1:48:59.960]  comply if you choose united non-compliance and we stand up for
[1:48:59.960 --> 1:49:05.760]  ourselves we spark a golden age of society where we will have a standard of
[1:49:05.760 --> 1:49:09.680]  living never before even thought achievable with a cost of living
[1:49:09.680 --> 1:49:15.400]  completely innocuous we can have a good life for everyone on this planet if we
[1:49:15.400 --> 1:49:20.440]  manage each country the way we manage a business and that's a problem every
[1:49:20.440 --> 1:49:24.120]  country right now is occupied by politicians and every one of these
[1:49:24.120 --> 1:49:28.600]  politicians had nothing to lose for the lockdown imagine we had people running
[1:49:28.600 --> 1:49:32.160]  the country that would never lock the country down because it would hurt them
[1:49:32.160 --> 1:49:35.640]  it would hurt their families that's what we need to do we need to restructure
[1:49:35.640 --> 1:49:40.560]  society against these lockdowns and if we don't these these type of lockdowns
[1:49:40.560 --> 1:49:43.800]  will turn into climate lockdowns and climate lockdowns will just turn into
[1:49:43.800 --> 1:49:49.680]  whatever other lockdown they want this is training society to be controlled for
[1:49:49.680 --> 1:49:54.360]  perpetual servitude and if we don't stand up now if we don't unite against
[1:49:54.360 --> 1:49:59.560]  this that's what's coming thankfully we already have you saw hundreds of thousands
[1:49:59.560 --> 1:50:04.520]  of people in Montreal we see millions of people around the world standing up we
[1:50:04.520 --> 1:50:08.280]  see the average person on the street walking over to me and knowing who I am
[1:50:08.280 --> 1:50:12.200]  even telling me to run for Prime Minister because they understand that what
[1:50:12.200 --> 1:50:16.680]  I'm preaching is how we get out of this United non-compliance means you say no
[1:50:16.680 --> 1:50:20.960]  to the vaccines you take off your mask you open your business if they try to
[1:50:20.960 --> 1:50:25.280]  mandate masks if they try to mandate vaccines you go on strike I don't care
[1:50:25.280 --> 1:50:30.600]  if you're a student doctor lawyer police officer I don't care what you do you
[1:50:30.600 --> 1:50:34.120]  have to care about freedom I don't care if you're double-jabbed and you're
[1:50:34.120 --> 1:50:38.080]  planning a third you still have to be care of freedom of choice that's what
[1:50:38.080 --> 1:50:42.160]  this is all about the freedom to make our money the freedom to live our lives
[1:50:42.160 --> 1:50:47.620]  and a real leader does not try to manage you the real leader will manage the
[1:50:47.620 --> 1:50:51.920]  country so you can look after your family and provide for your family and
[1:50:51.920 --> 1:50:56.240]  set up a wonderful future for your family that's a real leader and United
[1:50:56.240 --> 1:51:00.440]  non-compliance give the power to the people so they can do that and open up
[1:51:00.440 --> 1:51:04.480]  the avenue for a real leader to take over the country and help manage the
[1:51:04.480 --> 1:51:09.440]  country in a way that we can have prosperous society for generations and
[1:51:09.440 --> 1:51:14.200]  we can make these people examples for other people to know that they could
[1:51:14.200 --> 1:51:19.240]  never try this again and Chris tell us what happens if we don't stand up now
[1:51:19.240 --> 1:51:24.280]  though tell us the horrible future we've got and we don't stand up now we don't
[1:51:24.280 --> 1:51:29.800]  stand up now you don't get to stand up you don't you get to tell your children
[1:51:29.800 --> 1:51:33.760]  I'm sorry I failed you you get to tell your children that they get to spend
[1:51:33.760 --> 1:51:37.040]  their life in a camp or they get to spend their life getting jabbed until
[1:51:37.040 --> 1:51:41.360]  they get an adverse reaction you get to tell your children that you lot you
[1:51:41.360 --> 1:51:46.000]  failed your responsibility to provide them a future you failed your
[1:51:46.000 --> 1:51:49.880]  responsibility to your country you failed your responsibility to yourself and
[1:51:49.880 --> 1:51:54.440]  if that's what happens then we deserve everything would happen to us but be
[1:51:54.440 --> 1:52:00.640]  very very very sure about what you do next because if you are on the wrong
[1:52:00.640 --> 1:52:03.960]  side of history and I'm speaking to the police officers I'm speaking to the
[1:52:03.960 --> 1:52:09.440]  judges I'm speaking to the lawyers you saw what happened after Nazi Germany it's
[1:52:09.440 --> 1:52:13.720]  gonna be like that times a million because it's gonna be all around the
[1:52:13.720 --> 1:52:18.200]  world and all the suffering that you put on millions and billions and billions
[1:52:18.200 --> 1:52:23.440]  of people for your own personal agenda is gonna come crashing down on you and
[1:52:23.440 --> 1:52:28.920]  you're not gonna like how it feels if they wanted this to succeed I'm gonna
[1:52:28.920 --> 1:52:32.800]  tell you right now they should have done it when people like me weren't born
[1:52:32.800 --> 1:52:36.160]  when people like you weren't born they chose the wrong time in history to try
[1:52:36.160 --> 1:52:41.200]  this shit because I'm not gonna stop you're not gonna stop and the millions
[1:52:41.200 --> 1:52:44.960]  and millions of people we woke up are not gonna stop until we get our freedom
[1:52:44.960 --> 1:52:50.480]  back we get our lives back it's that simple and I agree with listen listen
[1:52:50.480 --> 1:52:53.800]  nationalist and patriots and populace we're getting elected everywhere they
[1:52:53.800 --> 1:52:58.840]  panicked they launched their operation lockstep but they even know we're gonna
[1:52:58.840 --> 1:53:03.520]  defeat them now that's why they're so incredibly desperate but how do we like
[1:53:03.520 --> 1:53:08.560]  Jesus or those that follow his example Mahatma Gandhi or then Martin Luther
[1:53:08.560 --> 1:53:12.760]  King jr. I'm not afraid to be violent I'm not afraid to die I'm not afraid
[1:53:12.760 --> 1:53:15.120]  whatever but I know they'd use that against us they're trying to say we're
[1:53:15.120 --> 1:53:18.000]  terrorists we're about to blow stuff up because they're assaulting us with
[1:53:18.000 --> 1:53:22.000]  poison shots they're assaulting us with literal Joseph Mengele Hitler
[1:53:22.000 --> 1:53:25.120]  injections they are violating the Nuremberg code we have a right to defend
[1:53:25.120 --> 1:53:28.960]  ourselves but they're trying to trick us into confrontation Klaus Wubbs says you'll
[1:53:28.960 --> 1:53:34.160]  all be very angry and explode we will use that for great reset how do we under
[1:53:34.160 --> 1:53:39.240]  this assault not get violent but like judo use that energy like Jesus Christ
[1:53:39.240 --> 1:53:43.880]  would do against him what would Jesus Christ what would Jesus Christ do right
[1:53:43.880 --> 1:53:48.160]  now I can't say what Jesus Christ would do but I could tell you what I want to do
[1:53:48.160 --> 1:53:53.240]  and that's spread love spread compassion come from a place of love how can they
[1:53:53.240 --> 1:53:56.320]  demonize you how can they pretend you're violent how can they pretend you're
[1:53:56.320 --> 1:54:00.080]  wrong when all you're doing is advocating for freedom of choice go find
[1:54:00.080 --> 1:54:03.680]  someone that I'm asking give them a hug tell them you love them find someone to
[1:54:03.680 --> 1:54:07.280]  to jazz to tell you you love them that doesn't mean they still believe in the
[1:54:07.280 --> 1:54:11.000]  backs path that's why they want you to be violent they want us to look violent
[1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:14.360]  they want us to look crazy they want to look like you just said it so violence
[1:54:14.360 --> 1:54:18.640]  is not the answer how do we stop clearly they're preparing a false flag you got
[1:54:18.640 --> 1:54:24.120]  me in take on that you just have to have the numbers we have what kind of
[1:54:24.120 --> 1:54:28.120]  violence can I use against 300,000 people they're gonna line up the army and
[1:54:28.120 --> 1:54:32.000]  tell them to mow everybody down you think the army is gonna do that the army
[1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:34.760]  would turn their guns on the government before they turn their guns and that's my
[1:54:34.760 --> 1:54:38.400]  final point you said it perfectly they want to be free I don't defend the
[1:54:38.400 --> 1:54:41.520]  Taliban they're horrible people but that's their country they've taken it
[1:54:41.520 --> 1:54:45.320]  over but they don't comply the whole biggest military in the world can't
[1:54:45.320 --> 1:54:49.400]  stop the Vietnamese or the Taliban they don't submit well how can they make
[1:54:49.400 --> 1:54:54.520]  Germany and France and Israel and the UK and Canada and the US and Australia
[1:54:54.520 --> 1:54:58.800]  New Zealand submit to permanent martial law when it's a fake vaccine it's
[1:54:58.800 --> 1:55:04.200]  poison I say stop complying and say no now elect new leaders and then arrest
[1:55:04.200 --> 1:55:11.320]  Fauci and Gates and try them in Nuremberg to hang their asses after they're
[1:55:11.320 --> 1:55:18.400]  convicted that's all we got to do and it's that easy it's really that easy
[1:55:18.400 --> 1:55:24.440]  that's all it takes it takes all of us to do what we did yesterday and keep doing
[1:55:24.440 --> 1:55:29.800]  it every day until we get our way and until we hold these people accountable
[1:55:29.800 --> 1:55:37.160]  and stop submitting stop following their orders warn everyone March demonstrate
[1:55:37.160 --> 1:55:43.760]  don't comply speak up say no or they admit this is a total dark age they're
[1:55:43.760 --> 1:55:47.960]  bringing us Chris 100% that's what they want to bring but guess what I'm
