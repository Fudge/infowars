[01:11.500 --> 01:18.300]  the globalist model you are prisoners in your country you are the lowest filth on earth it's a
[01:18.300 --> 01:24.960]  global standardized model we're gonna be going over all of that also Ron Paul isn't even sure
[01:24.960 --> 01:30.880]  he's gonna go to the Ron Paul Liberty Fest that was set up there in Tampa because it might anger
[01:30.880 --> 01:36.640]  the loving Republicans and Rand Paul has come out and said hey he wants to get along the
[01:36.640 --> 01:43.120]  Republican Party so hey let's all just be delusional his dad didn't endorse McCain four
[01:43.120 --> 01:48.720]  years ago but now he's endorsing Romney and that's fine I mean at least the polls are
[01:48.720 --> 01:55.520]  pro-second amendment what low taxes are they're not they're not they're not bad people but it's
[01:55.520 --> 02:04.040]  not bad that we are upset it's not bad that that that we're like wow you're not doctor

[02:09.760 --> 02:16.160]  map are upset we are the supporters we reflect who brought him to where he is and his son
[02:16.160 --> 02:23.040]  and I'd say 95% are very upset so we can open the phones up about that today and we've been
[02:23.040 --> 02:30.080]  told in the bunch of newspapers I read him yesterday by operatives that hey grow up and
[02:30.080 --> 02:35.680]  you're stupid in fact will you report me that article that it's like two words to Ron and

[02:47.120 --> 02:52.400]  and now Mitt Romney's totally paid for by the same people and I'm stupid I understand
[02:52.400 --> 02:58.000]  I'm stupid the Ron Paul really won the first primaries the Republican Party knows that
[02:58.000 --> 03:02.400]  they said hey instead of us always trying to destroy you the door is open and the polls
[03:02.400 --> 03:07.600]  said hey we're walking down the aisle done done done done or is that the graduation music

[12:53.760 --> 12:58.480]  a tax you've got to swipe a card to have a record of what you're doing because we're
[12:58.480 --> 13:04.000]  all international healthcare now and in which you do affects other people and we're told
[13:04.000 --> 13:10.800]  Communialized and Communitarianism that George W. Bush said he supported Communitarianism
[13:10.800 --> 13:17.360]  means communist system but it just we don't want global government we want global governance
[13:17.360 --> 13:24.480]  means the exact same thing we don't want we don't want communism we want Communitarianism
[13:24.480 --> 13:30.560]  but it's okay because it means the same thing because George W. Bush is a Republican and
[13:30.560 --> 13:35.480]  he goes to Republican functions and patted people on the head and Obama while he totally
[13:35.480 --> 13:40.520]  hammers all of his idiot constituents he goes and pats him on the head so it makes it all
[13:40.520 --> 13:45.560]  right and he himself is a puppet you haven't even gotten anywhere near breaking the surface
[13:45.560 --> 13:52.760]  of reality all these people buried alive buried alive politically spiritually psychically
[13:52.760 --> 13:58.760]  chemically and I am not going to live in this fake reality anymore I'm not playing around
[13:58.760 --> 14:02.480]  with any of it anymore I'm not going to sit here and play patty cake with all the fake
[14:02.480 --> 14:09.400]  constructs on the rest of it it's all bull they got polls out where 90 plus percent
[14:09.400 --> 14:13.320]  of Americans don't want military drones used against him well it's illegal to begin with
[14:13.320 --> 14:17.320]  it's unconstitutional it's out of his jurisdiction you're not supposed to have the military involved
[14:17.320 --> 14:22.280]  domestically because it's always used to take over in every case in history from Latin America
[14:22.280 --> 14:26.240]  and modern times in Africa and Asia right through the Julius Caesar and crossing the
[14:26.240 --> 14:36.840]  Rubicon this is what we're talking about here ladies and gentlemen and everything we've
[14:36.840 --> 14:41.920]  already been through in history is happening again with a bunch of delusional eugenicists
[14:41.920 --> 14:46.240]  calling themselves transhumanists but delusionally saying they're going to live forever and be
[14:46.240 --> 14:53.600]  gods and fly off to outer space when meanwhile all they do is wreck stuff and they're probably
[14:53.600 --> 14:57.520]  going to kill everybody it's only a matter of time till they trigger a black hole one
[14:57.520 --> 15:02.160]  of these superconducting super colliders or cyclotrons it's only a matter of time till
[15:02.160 --> 15:06.120]  they release some antimatter weapon the air force admits they've got to scare everybody
[15:06.120 --> 15:09.320]  it's only a matter of time till they release out of one of these level four bio weapons
[15:09.320 --> 15:14.640]  labs on purpose or by accident or one of their eugenicist cult members sneaks out with it
[15:14.640 --> 15:19.200]  stuff that kills 90 plus percent of people when you come in contact with it recombinant
[15:19.200 --> 15:25.720]  mouse pox designed for homo sapien sapien I mean you know that's just one of the attack
[15:25.720 --> 15:31.800]  patterns super weaponized flu super weaponized black plague super weaponized anthrax and stuff
[15:31.800 --> 15:43.320]  that we can't even imagine nano tech viral precursor micro plasms oh my god it's a oh
[15:43.320 --> 15:50.720]  my god we I mean it is we are on the absolute cusp of changes that are going to blow everybody
[15:50.720 --> 15:54.560]  away the globalists have suppressed at least 30 years of technology that's why they're
[15:54.560 --> 16:00.880]  so arrogant right now and I saw lord Rothschild get in front of a lucrodowski we got to play
[16:00.880 --> 16:04.040]  that clip we had it posted like a week ago but I'm gonna ask her to repost that at info

[16:09.760 --> 16:15.480]  around with this extreme intelligence in his eyes and just smiles at Luke and just sits
[16:15.480 --> 16:20.680]  there pitying him no telling that guy actually own the whole Rockefeller system that's why

[16:37.720 --> 16:43.360]  he just looks at Luke and just looks at him and those eyes of just evil intelligence just
[16:43.360 --> 16:49.680]  looks at him like you have no idea boy it's like when Luke confronted Senator Rockefeller
[16:49.680 --> 16:53.160]  and talked about his family funding Hitler and the eugenicist and he turned around he

[17:24.200 --> 17:28.440]  Rockefeller because I've done it myself before confronted these people and the minute the
[17:28.440 --> 17:32.920]  minute they know that you're actually addressing them all of a sudden it's like they uncluck
[17:32.920 --> 17:39.800]  and they just turn they're like oh yeah you see me I see you they're all asleep Jones
[17:39.800 --> 17:47.240]  you'll never wake them back and I have to sit here and watch her play play Patty cake
[17:47.240 --> 17:53.680]  hey let's take over the Republicans oh it's a genius plan of the polls yeah yeah oh yeah
[17:53.680 --> 17:58.880]  the Republicans that that's only one layer of the control and it's the other way around
[17:58.880 --> 18:03.360]  you can see that suddenly endorsing neocon candidates through campaign for liberty suddenly
[18:03.360 --> 18:10.160]  saying oh yeah sanctions an act of war good oh Mitt Romney's great also everyone has access
[18:10.160 --> 18:14.400]  to the new president because the word is it's going to be Romney now everything's switching
[18:14.400 --> 18:21.080]  against Obama just like it all switched against Bush and McCain and so it's like oh my god
[18:21.080 --> 18:25.920]  we'll be at the White House we'll be interviewing him we'll we'll know the president vice president
[18:25.920 --> 18:30.520]  oh my gosh I could dress up in a tuxedo and I could go to a dinner and go through and
[18:30.520 --> 18:35.520]  feel real important like a peacock sitting there with my feathers out look I've arrived
[18:35.520 --> 18:42.800]  I'm hanging out and with the with the people in Washington I've hung out with the biggest
[18:42.800 --> 18:48.960]  movie stars there are it means nothing I've hung out with some of the top scientists astronauts
[18:48.960 --> 18:54.400]  it means nothing none of it's real if they're not awake you hang out though with some old
[18:54.400 --> 18:59.440]  lady or some young man or some young woman or old woman whatever who is awake and knows
[18:59.440 --> 19:05.040]  what's going on and sees the matrix that's who I want to hang out with that's electric
[19:05.040 --> 19:10.440]  that's reality that's fulfilling that's important ladies and gentlemen they're announcing that
[19:10.440 --> 19:17.720]  they're gonna move now to ban popcorn and milk see they're gonna say what's dangerous
[19:17.720 --> 19:21.360]  they're gonna say what size your toilet is they're gonna say what type of batteries you

[19:35.740 --> 19:40.140]  you a national ID card. They're going to grab your genitals at checkpoints and abuse your
[19:40.140 --> 19:45.020]  wife and children in front of you. They're going to do it because they like to do it.
[19:45.020 --> 19:50.460]  Do you ever study history? Scum likes this. And good people that sit here in a trance,
[19:51.260 --> 19:54.780]  well it's actually not their fault because they were medically induced into this
[19:54.780 --> 19:57.740]  at birth via the Matrix integrator known as television.

[21:39.980 --> 21:43.660]  correct when stating a central bank issuing to public currency is a greater menace to the

[22:59.180 --> 23:03.420]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[23:03.980 --> 23:09.980]  I want you to know some very important information. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that
[23:09.980 --> 23:14.620]  carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the president could obtain this
[23:14.620 --> 23:20.620]  world-class healer. Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people
[23:20.620 --> 23:26.300]  healthy. Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17
[23:26.300 --> 23:31.500]  naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming

[23:36.460 --> 23:43.100]  immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body. Call 1-866-VENUS-FLY

[23:58.220 --> 24:08.220]  Yeah.
[24:12.460 --> 24:21.660]  Cyrus Jones from 1810 to 1930. Made his great-grandchildren believe you could live to 103.
[24:21.660 --> 24:27.260]  His 103 is forever. His 103 is forever when you're just a little kid.
[24:27.260 --> 24:36.540]  That's right. Cyrus Jones live forever. Grave digger. When you dig my grave,
[24:38.700 --> 24:49.580]  make it shallow, so I can feel the rain. Grave digger. All right, I said I get your calls and
[24:49.580 --> 24:54.860]  I'm going to do it. Here it is, though, coming up. Russia denies sending helicopters as serious as
[24:54.860 --> 24:59.500]  West Army rebels. Well, I mean, they admit they're arming al-Qaeda, the bankers that run our country.
[24:59.500 --> 25:03.340]  I'm supposed to love al-Qaeda. I'm supposed to love Mitt Romney. I'm sorry, it's not going to happen.
[25:03.340 --> 25:09.180]  Also exclusive, Bilderberg 1966 data dump, the war on nationalism exposed,
[25:09.820 --> 25:14.380]  U.S. government study, humans or national security threat to oceans and our planet.
[25:15.420 --> 25:20.220]  Now, we had it from 73, but this is one of the oldest documents saying humans are the threat
[25:20.220 --> 25:25.500]  by the predator class. Our government says we're bad. We're a threat. We're evil.
[25:25.500 --> 25:29.020]  Former World Bank President Wilkinson. I don't want to talk about Bilderberg.
[25:29.580 --> 25:35.500]  Jesse Ventura says the TSA is a pedophile hunting ground. An excerpt of that interview yesterday.
[25:35.500 --> 25:40.860]  That is all coming up today and a lot more. But first, let's just take calls the rest of the hour
[25:40.860 --> 25:45.500]  and then I'll get into. They're bringing Obama down. I saw this a few months ago shift. The word
[25:45.500 --> 25:50.700]  from big insiders was that they're done with him. Now, top democratic strategists say there's an
[25:50.700 --> 25:56.300]  unstoppable headwind. Either Obama is going to start a war, stage a false flag to play the hero,
[25:56.300 --> 26:00.780]  and that's only of the global handlers letting. But sometimes even within criminal subgroups,
[26:00.780 --> 26:06.620]  they'll do it on their own. Or it's going to be Mitt Romney. And all I'm saying is I'm not in a
[26:06.620 --> 26:12.060]  Mitt Romney bashing fest because all that does is get childlike Republicans to not listen to us.
[26:12.060 --> 26:19.260]  I'm just saying he's for gun control, open borders, abortion and a bunch of wars and NDAA and Patriot
[26:19.260 --> 26:24.300]  Act and warrantless spying. And he's a puppet. And people want to believe, hey, we're about to
[26:24.300 --> 26:33.100]  meet Obama. Yeah. Okay, just watch what happens. Just watch what happens. Just watch what happens.
[26:34.220 --> 26:39.100]  It's just like the Obama supporters. My God, they send me hate mail still saying I work for
[26:39.100 --> 26:45.740]  the Republicans. Just childlike idiots. And you would think because I agree with more what Republicans
[26:45.740 --> 26:49.740]  say than what you would Democrats. I mean, across the board, I don't agree with what Democrats stand
[26:49.740 --> 26:55.180]  for. I mean, it's a socialist, globalist, new world order, eugenics group, posing as loving,
[26:55.180 --> 27:00.220]  you know, trendy, super dangerous, super bad. But then the globalists just give us an alternative
[27:00.220 --> 27:05.020]  that gives us different rhetoric, but does the exact same thing. And a lot of times it's more done
[27:05.020 --> 27:12.540]  in the agenda. Shut up now. Start to call some Jonathan in North Carolina. You're on the air.
[27:12.540 --> 27:19.180]  What is on your mind today? Hey, I hope you can hear me all right. But I just want to let you know
[27:19.180 --> 27:26.780]  that currently we are actually something our NBC work natural biological and chemical. We've
[27:26.780 --> 27:35.900]  actually gotten in a whole fleet of the NBC FLAs, which is basically a ambulance. That's a decontamination
[27:35.900 --> 27:42.940]  unit. So are you a firefighter, police officer? I'm currently in the military as a medic. Okay,
[27:42.940 --> 27:47.660]  yeah, that's just the cover for federalization. That's phase one in the town. Next, it's fighting
[27:47.660 --> 27:51.660]  the locals with John Deere hats in drills. Actually, where John Deere hats. I've videoed this. We've
[27:51.660 --> 27:55.900]  shown it in urban warfare. The bad guys were John Deere hats. That's the enemy, the new al-Qaeda.
[27:55.900 --> 28:02.460]  It's not a beard and turban. It's a John Deere hat and overalls. But I mean, so what are they telling
[28:02.460 --> 28:08.620]  you? Well, actually, they're just upping the training. And also around here, there's been
[28:09.660 --> 28:13.660]  there's also been something weird going on post release. I think it has been for the last two
[28:13.660 --> 28:22.140]  weeks. They actually have a civilian military SWAT team that drives around in a kind of like modified
[28:22.140 --> 28:28.860]  Brinks truck that drives around. And these guys even going into like the PX to get some to eat
[28:28.860 --> 28:35.820]  or somewhere, they're in full regalia with everything short of M fours and shotguns,
[28:35.820 --> 28:41.100]  but they're still carrying around pistols and full body. I know they're bringing the mercs in now at
[28:41.100 --> 28:47.740]  every level and they're going to replace you soon. Yeah, well, if they replace me, then just, you
[28:47.740 --> 28:52.220]  know, give me a week's notice so I can go home. Well, I mean, I'm talking about down the road,
[28:52.220 --> 29:00.380]  robots, AI control drones are already in the sky, acting autonomously. And then little specialized
[29:00.380 --> 29:05.900]  corporate guys who've been tested psychologically and who don't care as long as the money's right.
[29:05.900 --> 29:11.020]  It's a total, imagine attack of the pirates. The globalist actually it's going bones. That's their
[29:11.020 --> 29:17.100]  idol is pirates. And just imagine the whole system is a pirate system run through government against
[29:17.100 --> 29:22.700]  us. Well, hey, I can only give you one more. I'm gonna have to go off because my scarf is just
[29:22.700 --> 29:29.980]  me. Um, there has actually been a CMB. Yeah, guys, hold the music down for a minute. Sir,
[29:29.980 --> 29:35.740]  make your point. Go ahead and make it. Um, well, no, they're moving all that NBC equivalent from
[29:35.740 --> 29:43.020]  other installation to this side to this coat. We're getting stuff from just all over the place.
[29:43.020 --> 29:47.020]  Now that's key. That means if they stage something there, they can pose as better
[29:47.020 --> 29:52.380]  saviors. Good points. Thank you for the call. We're on the March, the empires on the run.
[29:53.260 --> 29:56.140]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:00.620 --> 30:06.060]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[30:07.260 --> 30:12.380]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[30:12.380 --> 30:19.180]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[30:21.100 --> 30:27.660]  They so pride in every stitch. Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[30:29.420 --> 30:33.580]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[30:34.220 --> 30:41.980]  Blue diamond gussets got it. Others don't. We turned jeans inside out. Diamond
[30:41.980 --> 30:48.060]  gusset jeans made in the USA with unparalleled quality. Our Defender motorcycle jeans combined

[31:29.420 --> 31:33.980]  Doesn't require electricity. Purify water from lake streams, ponds and wells.

[31:38.860 --> 31:44.220]  water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic. Propure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.

[33:03.900 --> 33:08.220]  You could accept the fact that the city is headed for a disaster of biblical proportion.
[33:08.220 --> 33:11.420]  What do you mean biblical? What do you mean this Old Testament,
[33:11.420 --> 33:16.460]  Mr. Mayor? Real wrath of God type stuff. Fire and brimstone coming down from the skies,
[33:16.460 --> 33:20.940]  rivers and seas boiling. 40 years of darkness, earthquakes, volcanoes. The dead rising from
[33:20.940 --> 33:25.500]  the grave. Human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together, mass hysteria.
[33:27.260 --> 33:34.620]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over
[33:34.620 --> 33:45.340]  the mind of man, Thomas Jefferson. Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:47.340 --> 33:51.340]  It certainly is and thank you for joining us. Thank you for putting up with me.
[33:51.340 --> 33:58.220]  Great info from that member of the military earlier. They used those hazmat teams everywhere
[33:58.220 --> 34:03.500]  back in the 80s and the 90s to get the liaison and shut up local police and to go,
[34:03.500 --> 34:07.100]  yeah, the regular army's here, but they help us with bomb disposal.
[34:07.660 --> 34:13.900]  And now it will help you SWAT team somebody's house and it's going on covertly and it's totally
[34:13.900 --> 34:19.500]  illegal. But now it's admitted and the CFR comes out and says, yes, with the top general,
[34:19.500 --> 34:23.340]  we're going to start having the military respond as your local SWAT team, regular army.
[34:24.380 --> 34:29.340]  I mean, that's public two weeks ago. This is off the charts. And hey, you're not going to have
[34:29.340 --> 34:33.900]  that popcorn. You're not going to have that milk and New York's moving to ban that.
[34:34.620 --> 34:38.140]  And there's going to be new fines and fees. And we're going to dig through your garbage to make
[34:38.140 --> 34:44.780]  sure you've got the right recycling going on. This is about taking the biggest prison population
[34:44.780 --> 34:50.140]  in the world and doubling it. This is the new economy. This is like bank robbers coming in
[34:50.140 --> 34:53.180]  saying hands up and you're like, why are you robbing me? Because I'm a bank robber.
[34:53.180 --> 34:58.380]  Why is the new world we're going to do this? Because they're crooks, because they can and
[34:58.380 --> 35:02.860]  they like it. And the sky's the limit and they want a new dark age that they're going to call
[35:02.860 --> 35:06.380]  the new enlightenment. Okay, enough. Let's go to your calls. toll free number to join us,
[35:06.380 --> 35:14.140]  800-25-99-231. Coming up, Rand Paul says, yeah, I want the Republicans to like me. I love Romney
[35:14.140 --> 35:18.060]  and there's all the apologists out there saying it's a great idea. So, hey, I'm not mad at the
[35:18.060 --> 35:25.260]  Pauls. I'm just disappointed. And it's a part of a larger trend. So, I have to report on what
[35:25.260 --> 35:29.340]  they do now and I have to not be naive. I've seen some bad stuff happening last six months.
[35:29.980 --> 35:38.060]  But I certainly still appreciate the good work they're doing overall. But I have to point out
[35:38.060 --> 35:42.700]  the fact that the trajectory they're on is pretty soon. They'll be like John McCain or something.
[35:42.700 --> 35:48.620]  I mean, if Rand continued drifting this fast in a year or so, he'll be like John McCain, basically.
[35:48.620 --> 35:51.820]  And by then, everybody would have already said, well, it's okay. So, it's like, well,
[35:51.820 --> 35:58.540]  it's okay now. We've got to work with people. We've got to get along with the system.
[35:59.260 --> 36:05.900]  Hey, sit down, be reasonable, grow up, compromise. Well, we've been doing a lot of that, haven't we?
[36:05.900 --> 36:09.180]  And now they're like, yeah, we're listening to everything you do without warrants. It's illegal,
[36:09.180 --> 36:13.260]  but that's the way it is. Yeah, we banned the soft drinks last week. And now we're going to ban
[36:13.260 --> 36:17.660]  your popcorn. And then how much state you can have. And the government admits, that's what the
[36:17.660 --> 36:21.180]  Department of Health, Department of Energy, all of them say, Health and Human Services,
[36:21.180 --> 36:25.660]  that you'll have this ID card that charges you the national sales tax and it'll be graduated
[36:25.660 --> 36:29.420]  because poor people won't have to pay a lot of it at first, they're going to say. And then
[36:29.420 --> 36:34.220]  everything you do is tracked on the card, accessed by a digital face scan photo that's going in
[36:34.220 --> 36:41.100]  everywhere and or thumbprint or index finger. And so, oh, that's your allotment of red meat.
[36:41.100 --> 36:45.580]  Oh, that's your, and they're going to decide what you eat and what you do while jacking everything
[36:45.580 --> 36:51.660]  and not letting you have labeling that tells you something's GMO. And you watch people just die
[36:51.660 --> 36:56.140]  of more cancer, more diseases, the numbers will keep skyrocketing straight up as they are in
[36:56.140 --> 37:01.660]  every neurological disorder, every disorder of the gut, bone disorder, skeletal problems,
[37:01.660 --> 37:05.580]  skin problems, everything's just going to go up, up, up, up, up, up and they're going to come in
[37:05.580 --> 37:10.540]  as a solution and say, we're just going to incrementally tax and restrict and ban everything.
[37:10.540 --> 37:15.500]  If I had told you 10 years ago, as I did, they would start banning soft drinks and then ice cream
[37:15.500 --> 37:21.420]  and then red meat and popcorn oil and milk and not just raw milk, you'd say you're crazy. Oh,
[37:21.420 --> 37:24.300]  but I did say that. You said I was crazy. I told you 15 years ago, they were taking
[37:24.300 --> 37:28.860]  baby's blood at birth and a giant secret world government program declassified five years ago.
[37:28.860 --> 37:36.460]  Again, I don't want credit for any of this. Most of this stuff is declassified or it's
[37:36.460 --> 37:41.260]  been leaked to me. I'm going to say it again to all the bureaucrat enforcers who feel like
[37:41.260 --> 37:45.740]  they're winners because they're on the inside and they get some of the intel and they laugh at the
[37:45.740 --> 37:52.220]  public. You're being injected with cancer viruses, look it up and sterilence in all the major process
[37:52.220 --> 37:59.260]  food, the water. Okay. You're being killed. You're not on the winning team Dumbo. Okay. Wake up.
[38:00.300 --> 38:07.660]  Let me explain it again. You're being soft killed. Do you understand? Not in Kansas anymore.
[38:11.500 --> 38:16.140]  And hoping Obama's going to save you. Hoping Mitt Romney's going to save you. Hoping that
[38:16.140 --> 38:23.580]  the new British Prime Minister is going to save you. That's naive. We've got to admit
[38:23.580 --> 38:30.060]  just how crazy the social engineering's gotten layer after layer after layer after layer until
[38:30.060 --> 38:40.540]  we realize that there's only one way out of this and that is to really break with the system entirely
[38:40.540 --> 38:45.100]  and stop complying more and more, start small, but then more and more across the board,
[38:45.100 --> 38:50.060]  making a noise in public places, getting aggressive, breaking the zombie trance. You
[38:50.060 --> 38:55.340]  understand? We are literally cognitive counter revolutionaries. The globalists have had their
[38:55.340 --> 39:00.060]  zombie revolution, the brainwaves, all of it. We've got to break the trance. I'm sorry. I'm
[39:00.060 --> 39:06.700]  ranting. Kristen Alabama, you're on the air. Go ahead. Can you hear me okay? Yes, I can, sir.
[39:07.500 --> 39:14.060]  Okay. I wanted to send out a warning. I'm starting this on the online community that
[39:14.060 --> 39:19.580]  people seem to be wanting to jump on the Gary Johnson manwagon. Have you followed the libertarian
[39:19.580 --> 39:25.900]  party any this year? I know that the libertarian party has drifted quite a bit as well towards
[39:25.900 --> 39:31.740]  kind of green socialism and a bunch of other weirdnesses and that's because the power structure,
[39:31.740 --> 39:36.380]  all they've got to do is maintain control so they try to co-opt every every mass movement.
[39:36.380 --> 39:44.460]  But yes, Gary Johnson, you know, Bill Still has been running for the libertarian president.
[39:44.460 --> 39:53.020]  And I bring him on my financial website, dolbarker.com. But basically what Bill Still has
[39:53.020 --> 39:59.740]  exposed of Gary Johnson is he is a banster shield, Alex. And one of his debates, Gary Johnson
[39:59.740 --> 40:05.020]  quoted that Wall Street didn't commit any crimes in quotes. He also quoted that borrowing,
[40:05.020 --> 40:09.740]  borrowing money is okay, but printing money is not, which we both know is that how money is
[40:09.740 --> 40:16.380]  created is basically has to be borrowed into existence. And he's allied with a guy named
[40:16.380 --> 40:23.180]  Roger Stone. Bill Still exposed him through a middleman named Roger Miller. And he found
[40:23.180 --> 40:29.180]  out that this guy, Roger Stone, is a huge Nixon fan. All right, but listen, listen,
[40:29.180 --> 40:32.700]  I'm going to have Gary Johnson on tomorrow and I appreciate your call, Governor Johnson.
[40:32.700 --> 40:39.260]  And I don't think the libertarians are going to win, but it's good to build something alternative.
[40:39.260 --> 40:46.220]  I don't agree with him on having open borders because the people get here and have welfare
[40:46.220 --> 40:51.820]  shoved on them and become democratic voting operatives who 90 plus percent will vote to
[40:51.820 --> 40:55.820]  take my guns and my little bit of private property. You know, paying over half of what I
[40:55.820 --> 41:03.100]  produced to government, isn't enough. It's all Ford Foundation, globalist run. And so, yeah,
[41:03.100 --> 41:07.340]  I would be for free trade with China if they had no tariffs and we had no tariffs and they
[41:07.340 --> 41:14.540]  didn't have slave camps. But you've got to have some type of, of walls when the rest of the
[41:14.540 --> 41:18.620]  world's totally collapsed. Instead of globalism, you let the walls down. It's like opening the
[41:18.620 --> 41:23.500]  door on a submarine and everything gets flooded. Mexico's worse off than it was 20 years ago
[41:23.500 --> 41:31.020]  under NAFTA and get worse off. And so that's the issue here. But yeah, I mean, I don't think Gary
[41:31.020 --> 41:37.180]  Johnson is perfect. But I know he's been anti war. He's for drug decriminalization, which the
[41:37.180 --> 41:43.900]  globalists do not want. And so I'm not falling down. In fact, I'll open the phones up tomorrow
[41:43.900 --> 41:50.460]  when Gary's on his young 30 minutes or an hour. He's on for an hour. So we'll take calls tomorrow.
[41:50.460 --> 41:56.300]  You guys make me 30 minutes into it. Go to calls. Okay. And you know, Gary Johnson's a nice guy.
[41:56.300 --> 42:01.420]  Sometimes hearing him speaks like watching paint dry, but it's okay. He's going to be on the show
[42:01.420 --> 42:06.700]  tomorrow. And I already had him on before. I'm not just having him on now because Rand Paul's
[42:06.700 --> 42:11.500]  being wedded to Mitt Romney. And again, I think it's a beautiful wedding. And I'm sure everybody's
[42:11.500 --> 42:16.540]  going to have fun at the wedding and I'm not against it. I just don't particularly like it.
[42:16.540 --> 42:24.220]  But I'm being sarcastic now, ladies and gentlemen. Let's go ahead and take a call from Brian
[42:24.220 --> 42:31.100]  in Pennsylvania. You're on the air, Brian. Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call. Man,
[42:31.100 --> 42:39.260]  it was great meeting you and Shan Tilly at the Bilderberg meeting. This thing with Ron Paul has
[42:39.260 --> 42:45.420]  really got me worked up. I mean, I feel like it's a betrayal. I feel like I've been punched in the gut.
[42:45.420 --> 42:53.900]  And I'm afraid or I don't know, maybe hopeful that this is going to be a trigger for maybe
[42:53.900 --> 42:59.740]  a call to action from the info warriors to make a move. I mean, what are our choices here? We've
[42:59.740 --> 43:10.140]  got Obama or Romney. Those are our choices. Come on, man. I'm just sick of it, Alex. It's time for
[43:10.140 --> 43:15.660]  well, you know what? You know what the big New Jersey newspaper, New Jersey dot com
[43:16.860 --> 43:22.060]  had to say two words for those upset by Rand Paul endorsement of Mitt Romney grow up.
[43:22.780 --> 43:28.220]  And they go on to say, and you know, the masses are upset with it. And they go on to say,
[43:28.220 --> 43:33.340]  and the masses just aren't that smart. So, so listen, you shouldn't, you're, you're, hold on,
[43:33.340 --> 43:39.340]  you're not smart because you know that Mitt Romney wrote Obamacare. You're not smart because you
[43:39.340 --> 43:43.260]  know, Mitt Romney's been for abortion for 20 plus years, but now says he's against it. You're not
[43:43.260 --> 43:48.060]  smart because he always stabs his constituents in the back and his own by Goldman Sachs publicly,
[43:48.060 --> 43:53.180]  just like Obama. You're not smart because you know, he supported carbon taxes. You're not smart
[43:53.180 --> 43:57.500]  because you know, Ron Paul didn't endorse McCain. And as bad as McCain is, Romney's even worse on
[43:57.500 --> 44:02.220]  the voting record. You're not smart. And the Ron Paul of four years ago, he wasn't smart.
[44:02.220 --> 44:05.980]  See, Ron Paul and everybody, and by the way, Ron Paul's involved, they've gotten smart.
[44:05.980 --> 44:13.180]  So just admit you're not that smart. It says you're not that smart. This is Paul Mulshine.
[44:13.180 --> 44:18.780]  You're not smart and you need to grow up. Okay. So yeah, grow up. Get behind Romney,
[44:18.780 --> 44:22.540]  who says we shouldn't audit the Fed and that Congress has no power over the issuance of
[44:22.540 --> 44:29.580]  currency and credit. Grow up. How dare you listen to Jack Hunter. Grow up. We've got to make the
[44:29.580 --> 44:35.020]  Republicans happy. So let's have a war with Iran. Let's have sanctions. Let's have torture.
[44:35.020 --> 44:40.540]  Let's, let's, let's endorse neocon candidates and let's endorse Romney. Okay. Grow. In fact,
[44:40.540 --> 44:46.460]  I'm announcing I'm growing up today. I've just grown up. And you know, we shouldn't be hardcore
[44:46.460 --> 44:51.500]  and change the discourse by moving the overton window back towards liberty. We should let them
[44:51.500 --> 44:57.020]  walk us into tyranny through a process. So again, grow up. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
[44:57.660 --> 45:04.780]  No, I'm not. Yeah, I'm ready to grow up. Alex, I'm sick of the TSA. I'm sick of the FDA.
[45:04.780 --> 45:09.740]  Grow up. Got to do it to keep you safe. Can't let you know of a GMO. Got to arrest Anish.
[45:09.740 --> 45:15.500]  You've got to let them ban, ban sodas and milk and popcorn all over the country. It's not just
[45:15.500 --> 45:20.780]  New York. You got to grow up. We need inspectors to dig through our trash. We need the NSA to
[45:20.780 --> 45:26.140]  spy on us without warrants. We need 30,000 armed drone switch blades against us. Grow up. We need
[45:26.140 --> 45:32.860]  sodium fluoride in the water, sevenfold increase in bone cancer. Grow up. Grow up. Grow up. I'm
[45:32.860 --> 45:38.700]  sorry. I'm sick of their drones. Alex, I think we need our own drones with live stream to spy on
[45:38.700 --> 45:45.340]  them. No, that's an invasion of no government secret under national security and we have no
[45:45.340 --> 45:53.420]  rights. Grow up. No, I'm, I'm tired of being oppressed. I'm trying to be told that I have to
[45:53.420 --> 46:00.140]  take their GMO. I'm tired. Grow up, sir. Enjoy that. Enjoy the tenfold thousand increase plus in
[46:00.140 --> 46:06.700]  pediatric cancer. No, sir. No, sir. Oh, grow up. Grow up. Hey, they say there's death panels. They
[46:06.700 --> 46:11.900]  want to kill grandma. It's ready to kill your parents. Grow up. Grow up. I want a strip
[46:11.900 --> 46:16.540]  surgery in the airport, Alex. So what if the TSA wants to molest your wife in front of you
[46:16.540 --> 46:22.860]  and put you in a microwave oven? Grow up. A man's got to stand up and say no. No, no, George
[46:22.860 --> 46:29.980]  Washington was wrong. Grow up. Grow up. I appreciate your call. Get rid of him. He hadn't grown up yet.
[46:29.980 --> 46:34.380]  Some kind of weirdo wants freedom going into this show. Mitt Romney's awesome.
[46:36.460 --> 46:44.140]  I like him. He's got clean cut hair. $2,000 suit. Perfectly tailored. He smiles at you. Hi, how you
[46:44.140 --> 46:48.780]  doing? Ted Bundy would do that. Pull the whole yellow Volkswagen. Hey, get in the car. I think
[46:48.780 --> 46:53.180]  I need a little 16-year-old. Oh, yeah. Hey, let's go to my house. We're going to have some fun.
[46:53.180 --> 46:57.020]  Once we get there now, you try to open your mouth. I'm going to blow your head off, sister.
[46:57.020 --> 47:01.500]  When I get you where we're going, everything's going to be all right now. Hey, he was smiling.
[47:01.500 --> 47:05.420]  Hi, I'm Mitt Romney. Oh, hi. I'm charming like a fake cheerleader. Hey.
[47:09.260 --> 47:14.860]  Yeah. Oh, it's so loving. Thank you, Chris. I understand you're upset or whoever that.
[47:14.860 --> 47:19.820]  What was that caller's name? Was that Brian? Okay. Who do we go to now?
[47:22.220 --> 47:26.380]  Peter in Florida, you're on the air. I hope you've grown up and realize that we...
[47:26.940 --> 47:31.260]  Yeah. Listen up. Listen up. Listen, Alex, man. First of all, I want to say, you know, you've done
[47:31.260 --> 47:37.100]  an incredible, you know, I don't tell you anymore. You're the man. But listen up. I want to just start
[47:37.100 --> 47:40.220]  off what I'm going to say. And I think I got a pretty important message by saying, remember,
[47:40.220 --> 47:45.980]  we can't always invest in a person. Like you always say, they could tear down a person,
[47:45.980 --> 47:49.820]  but the ideas have to go on. So first of all, everybody who's freaking out,
[47:49.820 --> 47:56.220]  Rand Paul this, Rand Paul that, everybody calm down first of all. And grow up. Yeah, grow up.
[47:56.220 --> 48:02.060]  But now listen, second of all, I have to tell you here in South Florida, we've in four years,
[48:02.860 --> 48:08.380]  just about have completely taken over the Republican party here. I don't want to say
[48:08.380 --> 48:13.500]  specifically in which city. And that's why this deal has been made. The Paulites were starting
[48:13.500 --> 48:17.820]  to take over. And so suddenly it's being taken over. And that's why this is so bad. But it doesn't
[48:17.820 --> 48:21.980]  matter. But remember, remember, and I don't mean to cut you off. I know you can cut off too,
[48:21.980 --> 48:26.860]  but whatever. Listen, I remember when Rand Paul was running for Senate, my brother and I, both
[48:26.860 --> 48:32.940]  were like, what is going on with Rand Paul? He's saying all this mainstream neocon nonsense.
[48:32.940 --> 48:38.460]  He wins, Rand slide, right? And then he, who, I mean, I know he put the sanctions on Iran, but
[48:38.460 --> 48:44.300]  this guy was at the charge up against NDAA, you know, a TSA, and he went full force. Now,
[48:44.300 --> 48:48.700]  I'm not saying like I said, he's just a guy, he can be torn down like anybody else. But
[48:48.700 --> 48:53.660]  it's so unreal. It's so easy. And I got to tell that guy who just called in freaking out,
[48:53.660 --> 48:57.580]  man, know what your power is and know what your strength is. My brother and I,
[48:57.580 --> 49:04.460]  we walk into the party and we, they know that we're borderline anarcho capitalists. I mean,
[49:04.460 --> 49:09.340]  there's no, there's no hiding it, but they let us do what we want. They love us because
[49:09.340 --> 49:14.300]  we're personality driven. They don't have any philosophical. No, they don't. It's a bunch of
[49:14.300 --> 49:19.980]  fossils in the Republican party that want to feel powerful and official. And that's the thing.
[49:19.980 --> 49:25.260]  Good people can take over when we take the field. Exactly. Exactly. Listen, it's literally like a
[49:25.260 --> 49:29.340]  social club. There's, if these people were nerds, they'd be at a Star Trek convention. It's the
[49:29.340 --> 49:34.060]  same thing. Exactly. No, but, no, but listen, I got to tell everybody out there, you got to hear
[49:34.060 --> 49:40.300]  this. Once you go in and get rid of that whole defensive like attitude, you can know it. Man,
[49:40.300 --> 49:44.060]  there's people, they're talking about agenda 21. There's people there yelling at the senators
[49:44.060 --> 49:48.940]  for stuff that you would hear on your show on the daily basis. However, if you just go in there
[49:48.940 --> 49:54.540]  and kind of keep your calm, I think, I think this is what he's doing now and he's getting in there
[49:54.540 --> 49:59.340]  because look how easy it was. I mean, look how difficult it was four years ago to get these
[49:59.340 --> 50:02.700]  ideas mainstream. No, I hear you. I hear you and I appreciate the points you're making. We got to
[50:02.700 --> 50:07.820]  go to break. I got to go to break, brother. We'll come back and take more calls. Listen, yes, the
[50:07.820 --> 50:13.500]  Republican party knows Ron Paul really won those three, two states for sure, probably three or four,
[50:13.500 --> 50:20.140]  but two Iowa main for sure. And so they're scared and they know the campaign for liberty
[50:20.140 --> 50:25.740]  and the liberty movement and our radio show and others are exposing agenda 21, the new world order.
[50:25.740 --> 50:30.380]  It's hot. You know, Charlie Daniels is waking up. I mean, it's happening everywhere. I traveled
[50:30.380 --> 50:35.340]  across the country. Every place I went in restaurants, a firework store, there was listeners
[50:35.340 --> 50:40.140]  everywhere. I went to a firework store like five people and three or more listeners. Yes,
[50:40.940 --> 50:46.540]  but I'm saying that goes both ways. We don't now say, Hey, we're infiltrating them. Let's play along
[50:46.540 --> 50:52.940]  with it. No, no, no, no, no, no. You go in there, you take it over openly. You take it over openly
[50:52.940 --> 50:58.460]  and you tell campaign for liberty, don't start endorsing CFR people or we'll create a whole new
[50:58.460 --> 51:03.100]  system. That's all I'm saying. For a long time, you've heard me talk about building your own food

[54:07.660 --> 54:30.060]  I am a Midwest farmer. I make a living off the land. I ride a John Deere tractor. I'm a liberated man.
[54:30.060 --> 54:38.620]  The rain hasn't fallen since the middle of July. And if it don't come soon, my crops will die.
[54:38.620 --> 54:44.220]  The bankman says he likes me. The bankman says he likes me, but there's nothing he can do.
[54:44.220 --> 54:50.460]  Mitt Romney says he likes me, but there's nothing he can do. He ain't my friend,
[54:50.460 --> 54:59.980]  he ain't my friend. And I'll ride again. And I'll ride again.
[55:00.140 --> 55:04.300]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, I'm starting to go to your calls. We're going to continue taking more
[55:04.300 --> 55:09.260]  of them. I'm glad you're fired up. Coming up, Business Insider. See, it's going mainstream.
[55:09.260 --> 55:12.940]  This chart shows the Bilderberg group's connection to everything in the world.
[55:12.940 --> 55:20.140]  And it shows how they sit in interlocking directorates over 400 plus of the Fortune 500.
[55:20.140 --> 55:24.940]  Scroll down. We'll show people watching in prisonplanet.tv that if not, I'm going to link to this
[55:24.940 --> 55:31.020]  right now at infowars.com. And it ties in with a big article that we've got today by Aaron Dykes
[55:31.020 --> 55:37.340]  that's at infowars.com. We've now finally scanned all hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of pages
[55:37.340 --> 55:45.180]  of the 1966 Bilderberg documents, exclusive Bilderberg 1966 data dump, the war on nationalism
[55:45.180 --> 55:51.500]  exposed. Very powerful article and hundreds of pages of documents. Now in PDF, it went up last
[55:51.500 --> 55:55.020]  night and the article was written this morning. I guess Aaron stated to like three in the morning
[55:55.020 --> 56:01.580]  to get this done. It is up there right now at infowars.com in the featured news area. Be sure
[56:01.580 --> 56:08.380]  and get all of that out. And I will get into the nanny state. I will get into male fertility
[56:08.380 --> 56:13.660]  plunging. That's a London independent article. We will get into US cities and brace software to
[56:13.660 --> 56:20.300]  automatically detect suspicious behavior. Slate.com. Hey, how about systems to automatically detect
[56:20.300 --> 56:25.340]  suspicious government behavior that our founders warned us of? Oh, it's not suspicious behavior.
[56:25.340 --> 56:29.660]  It's shipping guns to Mexico to blame the Second Amendment and the false flag. It's shipping al-Qaeda
[56:29.660 --> 56:34.220]  in Libya and now Syria publicly. I mean, what are you doing running al-Qaeda? Well, we always
[56:34.220 --> 56:41.340]  knew you ran it, but now it's admitted. You think we're that stupid? What are you doing with not
[56:41.340 --> 56:47.100]  letting us mark GMO food? What are you doing with all this tyranny and trillions and banker
[56:47.100 --> 56:50.380]  bailouts and corporate welfare? You know, what are you doing? They're like, hey, you know what
[56:50.380 --> 56:56.220]  we're doing? We're robbing you blind and you put up with it. You see, once you put up with corruption
[56:56.220 --> 57:00.620]  and you make excuses for it, the corrupt know you'll just pretty much start putting up with
[57:00.620 --> 57:06.380]  anything and everything. Like Jerry Sandusky's wife going on all these vacations with little abused
[57:06.380 --> 57:12.860]  kids and reportedly in the same room with her, but she didn't know what was going on. Ladies and
[57:12.860 --> 57:18.380]  gentlemen, it's the same thing with all these crimes and situations. We just put up with the TSA
[57:18.380 --> 57:24.620]  abusing us and it just becomes normalized like Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia or the Aztecs.
[57:25.180 --> 57:30.780]  It was normal to have child sacrifice every morning when the sun came up all over Mesoamerica
[57:30.780 --> 57:36.700]  under the Mayans. And to them, that was normal. Well, you know what? It didn't normal. It's sick.
[57:36.700 --> 57:42.460]  It's demented and this culture is buried alive and I want to dig us out of it.
[57:44.380 --> 57:51.100]  They love it. These disasters, it's just beautiful to them. They love it and we're giving the worst
[57:51.100 --> 57:56.460]  people control by not getting aggressive with them. All right, we're going to go to Brighton,
[57:56.460 --> 58:02.300]  come back with John, Nana, Nicholas, Chris, George, everybody, and I will try to accelerate
[58:02.300 --> 58:06.300]  through calls for 30 minutes and then I'm going to news blitz. And boys, there are a lot of them
[58:06.300 --> 58:13.260]  already mentioned some of it. So stand by, countdown for that. Also your purchases at infowarshop.com

[58:42.940 --> 58:47.020]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:50.140 --> 58:54.700]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[58:54.700 --> 58:59.020]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[58:59.020 --> 59:04.060]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[59:04.060 --> 59:09.660]  to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[59:09.660 --> 59:14.780]  is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[59:14.780 --> 59:19.500]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four,
[59:19.500 --> 59:24.060]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year thousands of families lose
[59:24.060 --> 59:28.860]  their power from weather related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful
[59:28.860 --> 59:33.020]  backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[59:33.020 --> 59:37.260]  offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information
[59:37.260 --> 59:44.140]  at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government doesn't own the sun,

[59:49.580 --> 59:58.460]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:04.940 --> 1:00:12.300]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[1:00:12.300 --> 1:00:21.180]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:22.380 --> 1:00:26.620]  Yeah, I am wound up, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much for joining us for another
[1:00:26.620 --> 1:00:32.940]  global transmission, another hour of Info Wars Live. I'm your host, Alex Jones. Open phones in
[1:00:32.940 --> 1:00:38.860]  a solar, huge news blitz coming up at the bottom of the hour. Man, there's a lot of crazy news.
[1:00:38.860 --> 1:00:42.780]  I mean, I knew they were going to get around to it, but banned soft drinks above certain ounces,
[1:00:42.780 --> 1:00:49.660]  now milk products, popcorn in New York, snoops in your trash can. This is going nationwide.
[1:00:49.660 --> 1:00:54.380]  That's all coming up. Also, a great article by Mike Adams from naturalnews.com. We have posted
[1:00:54.380 --> 1:01:00.460]  at infowars.com. Zombies, deniers, sociopaths, schemers, and protectors, the five dominant
[1:01:00.460 --> 1:01:07.340]  personalities you'll encounter in the world gone mad. Yeah, it's all people seeking power
[1:01:07.340 --> 1:01:13.500]  through false templates they've been taught. I mean, you know, you call the protectors the
[1:01:13.500 --> 1:01:18.140]  henpeckers. And they're the types that like somebody's choking and nobody's helping and they go,
[1:01:18.140 --> 1:01:23.020]  911, 911, 911. You're like, you got to do a homework maneuver. Are you trained in that?
[1:01:24.220 --> 1:01:27.580]  You know, after you save the person, you're like, you're a hero. Wait, stop, so we can have the
[1:01:27.580 --> 1:01:33.660]  police arrest you. Arrest someone. I feel powerful when I do. I have no power, but through the system
[1:01:33.660 --> 1:01:39.740]  I have power. Okay, I'm sorry. Let's go ahead. I was screaming the consciousness of one of those
[1:01:39.740 --> 1:01:44.700]  people. In fact, I'm going to do an imitation of each one of these coming up. I should do a skit
[1:01:44.700 --> 1:01:48.460]  today before the nightly news and shoot it with somebody talking to me and I'll play the part of
[1:01:48.460 --> 1:01:56.220]  each one. Anybody ready to go to the costume shop? Let's talk to John and Illinois. You're on the air.
[1:01:56.220 --> 1:02:01.260]  Go ahead. Welcome, my friend. Good morning, Alex. Great show today. You're in top form.
[1:02:01.260 --> 1:02:07.100]  Two quick points. The hot button one, Rand Paul, Ron Paul. As you said many times on the show,
[1:02:07.100 --> 1:02:14.700]  he is a focal point. In 2008, we drafted Ron Paul to be our leader. I was with a Ron Paul
[1:02:14.700 --> 1:02:21.260]  Meetup Group, a former CEO of some corporation, was in there with us. He said, I cannot believe
[1:02:21.260 --> 1:02:25.980]  that this isn't a top-down organization and you're not getting orders from headquarters.
[1:02:25.980 --> 1:02:33.260]  And we said, Mr, this is grassroots. It's from the bottom up. We drafted him. Okay. Remember
[1:02:33.260 --> 1:02:40.380]  before the kickoff to the 2008 election cycle, you had Ron Paul on and he got about a half a
[1:02:40.380 --> 1:02:45.420]  million dollars in unsolicited donations. I was one of the ones who sent him a check.
[1:02:46.300 --> 1:02:54.220]  That proved to him that he was our standard bearer. Now, Alex, what happens if the Ron Paul revolution
[1:02:54.220 --> 1:02:59.660]  continues and it is continuing? They are taking over the delegates. They're taking over the state
[1:02:59.660 --> 1:03:03.340]  convention. But they're not doing anything with it. Ron Paul, they're saying may not even go to the
[1:03:03.340 --> 1:03:08.620]  big Ron Paul event. They were putting on separate from the RNC because it might anger the Republicans.
[1:03:08.620 --> 1:03:16.140]  I'm saying every shine. I mean, if Rand had a little bit of stuff to just not let the neocons
[1:03:16.140 --> 1:03:20.860]  attack him, he's done some of that. I let him alone. But then the Romney thing on top of all
[1:03:20.860 --> 1:03:28.060]  these endorsements of neocons, it's a major turn. I mean, there's a lot of people inside
[1:03:28.060 --> 1:03:34.540]  the campaign family. They've been concerned. And then now we're told to grow up. Again,
[1:03:34.540 --> 1:03:40.780]  the response is so political. I'm concerned too, but they could be engaging in duplicity and then
[1:03:40.780 --> 1:03:45.340]  turning over. One other point about the police waking up. A good friend of mine, Southwest
[1:03:45.340 --> 1:03:51.420]  side of Chicago has a lot of Chicago police friends. And a couple of weeks ago, one of the
[1:03:51.420 --> 1:03:57.580]  police friends, his name will only be Pat here. He had a falling out with him because he didn't
[1:03:57.580 --> 1:04:03.260]  believe that 911 was an inside job and all this other stuff. And he got a call and he basically
[1:04:03.260 --> 1:04:08.300]  apologized to him. He says, you know what? I woken up and I'm listening to Alex now. I stopped
[1:04:08.300 --> 1:04:14.540]  listening to man cow. Well, let's not be mean to old man cow. I was supposed to be on man cow show
[1:04:14.540 --> 1:04:19.500]  this morning, but I'd promised my children at eight 30, I'd go play with them. And I was supposed
[1:04:19.500 --> 1:04:23.900]  to be on at eight and man cow called me at eight 30. And I told my wife, don't answer. And she
[1:04:23.900 --> 1:04:28.860]  answers. Oh, come on the shows. I mean, I can't apologize to man cow, but I can't not come on
[1:04:28.860 --> 1:04:33.020]  at the right time. Man cow overall is a good guy compared to a lot of the stuff that's on air.
[1:04:33.020 --> 1:04:37.180]  And if he doesn't think it's an inside job, and that's always his view, that's fine. The reason
[1:04:37.180 --> 1:04:41.420]  Ron Paul and Rand Paul are held to a higher standard is that they were always the guys that
[1:04:41.420 --> 1:04:46.700]  were on the straight and narrow. Now for them to change course is a big deal. And they have
[1:04:46.700 --> 1:04:52.140]  changed course. And a lot of us, the dam broke on this because a lot of us were in somewhat of
[1:04:52.140 --> 1:04:57.180]  denial. We were seeing troubling signs. We're not stupid. Like some of their people are saying,
[1:04:57.180 --> 1:05:02.540]  we're astute and we know what we're saying. For a long time, you've heard me talk about building

[1:08:10.860 --> 1:08:15.500]  We are taking your phone calls, big news blitz coming up at the bottom of the hour,
[1:08:15.500 --> 1:08:19.420]  and then I'll continue with calls today. No guess, we have time to take a lot of calls.
[1:08:19.420 --> 1:08:26.780]  But even David Adams, a Tea Party activist who managed Paul's Republican primary in 2010,
[1:08:26.780 --> 1:08:31.420]  said my first thought really was that Rand may be suffering from Stockholm syndrome.
[1:08:32.620 --> 1:08:37.500]  And that's where you love your abusers. Yes, cognitive, dissonance, learned helplessness,
[1:08:39.740 --> 1:08:46.300]  normalcy bias. Yeah, that's what I've said. Rand and Ron are gentlemen, they're smart guys,
[1:08:46.300 --> 1:08:49.660]  and we're going to go over some quotes. Rand has now officially responded.
[1:08:50.380 --> 1:08:56.620]  The article in the text is up at infowars.com. Headline, I'm supporting the party that I belong to.
[1:08:56.620 --> 1:09:03.740]  Rand Paul speaks about Romney endorsement, which this all started Thursday. It was a firestorm,
[1:09:03.740 --> 1:09:08.060]  I'd say 95% of people. In fact, we got to look at the poll that's on infowars.com and get those
[1:09:08.060 --> 1:09:13.500]  numbers later on what our voters there are saying about it. But last I've seen other polls 95%
[1:09:13.500 --> 1:09:18.940]  are very upset. I mean, if this is business as usual, why didn't Ron Paul endorse McCain four
[1:09:18.940 --> 1:09:25.020]  years ago? I mean, Rand didn't have to run out on TV. He could have later said, well,
[1:09:25.020 --> 1:09:28.940]  I have some issues with Romney, but you know, he is the nominee, but instead it's like,
[1:09:28.940 --> 1:09:33.180]  I have a lot in common with him. We know you met with him a few weeks ago, you're being looked at
[1:09:33.180 --> 1:09:39.020]  for VP. I know that's been going on behind the scenes. And Rand does make the argument that,
[1:09:39.020 --> 1:09:43.660]  hey, we've gotten chairmanship, we're taking over the party. Okay, but you add that with
[1:09:43.660 --> 1:09:50.380]  campaign for liberty endorsing neocons like Mr. Cruz in Texas, who supports property taxes and
[1:09:50.380 --> 1:09:58.220]  wife CFR. You add to that. The fact that they're not as hardcore as they used to be that he's
[1:09:58.220 --> 1:10:02.940]  endorsing sanctions that his father says is an act of war and shouldn't be like, well,
[1:10:02.940 --> 1:10:10.380]  he's ran. He's not his dad. Exactly. Exactly. But, but so we don't have to be in a total
[1:10:10.380 --> 1:10:14.620]  love affair with Rand. We're not saying he's bad. We're allies with him on many issues,
[1:10:14.620 --> 1:10:20.940]  but it's not bad for us. As a bunch of the party operatives have been saying, I mean,
[1:10:20.940 --> 1:10:25.260]  I mean, here's again, this article syndicated column is in the New Jersey papers and the
[1:10:25.260 --> 1:10:29.660]  California papers, two words for those that upset by the Rand Paul endorsement of Mitt Romney.
[1:10:29.660 --> 1:10:35.900]  Grow up, Paul Mulschein. And it goes on to say one of the problems with the mass movements is
[1:10:35.900 --> 1:10:40.620]  they're made up of the masses and the masses just aren't that smart. You're saying libertarian
[1:10:40.620 --> 1:10:45.900]  constitutionalists aren't that smart. I've seen the numbers, the youth, but also the high test
[1:10:45.900 --> 1:10:51.820]  scores, the older folks, the wealth level of Ron Paul supporters is a giant middle class,
[1:10:51.820 --> 1:10:56.620]  upper middle class and wealthy movement. I mean, we're not idiots. Okay.
[1:10:56.620 --> 1:11:02.220]  Constitutionalism is something that people that have been somewhat successful that don't want
[1:11:02.220 --> 1:11:09.820]  to be leached off of and understand due process of law and protections are important. I mean,
[1:11:09.820 --> 1:11:17.180]  now we're unwashed idiots. But I mean, that sounds like MSNBC. All they do is get on MSNBC
[1:11:17.180 --> 1:11:22.700]  and talk about how smart so-called liberals are and how great they are and how they want to manage
[1:11:22.700 --> 1:11:28.060]  and run things and how stupid everyone else is. I mean, that really gets me mad. I mean,
[1:11:28.060 --> 1:11:34.380]  lectured by like 14-year-old, you know, Jack Hunter with his comb over. I'm not trying to be mean,
[1:11:34.380 --> 1:11:43.340]  but I mean, it's insulting reading off a teleprompter going. Come on, man. Come on.
[1:11:45.500 --> 1:11:49.500]  I'm not buying it. Okay. And again, it's the response
[1:11:49.500 --> 1:11:57.820]  that's made people even matter. But the big issue is Obama. He's out of control,
[1:11:57.820 --> 1:12:01.900]  but his political star is starting to fall. I'm going to cover that later. And so I wish we had
[1:12:01.900 --> 1:12:08.540]  somebody better. I mean, Ron Paul kept saying, and it can't be for liberty. Hey, keep giving money,
[1:12:08.540 --> 1:12:11.500]  keep fighting for delegates. We're going to go in there and demand things and take over.
[1:12:11.500 --> 1:12:16.220]  So people would show up at state parties like Louisiana just to get the delegates where they
[1:12:16.220 --> 1:12:22.300]  won, you know, the most delegates and they were beat up and sent to the hospital and Paul's like
[1:12:22.300 --> 1:12:31.500]  Rand Paul, Ron Paul's, his dad, Ron Paul comes out and says, need to be respectful. Oh, I mean,
[1:12:31.500 --> 1:12:35.740]  I got news articles where the Pauls are saying they may not even show up at the thing that's been
[1:12:35.740 --> 1:12:41.900]  planned for six months. They have this big counter convention where constitutional ideas are put
[1:12:41.900 --> 1:12:47.340]  out and they're like, we don't know if we can go to that. Oh yeah. And the Republicans are saying
[1:12:47.340 --> 1:12:54.780]  they might not give us those fairgrounds. Oh yeah. Sorry. Yeah. We don't know about that.
[1:12:55.580 --> 1:13:01.660]  That might upset Mitt Romney. If we have a group of people pointing out big governments out of
[1:13:01.660 --> 1:13:07.340]  control, you know, Ron Paul won CPAC two years in a row, got standing ovations with anti-war
[1:13:07.340 --> 1:13:12.300]  statements, anti-corporate welfare statements. And the Republican Party said, don't have him back
[1:13:12.300 --> 1:13:21.660]  this next year, this year because they're scared. They know what's happening. That's why they cheated
[1:13:21.660 --> 1:13:26.300]  and stole and would lie when he won polls and said he couldn't win. And when he did win the first
[1:13:26.300 --> 1:13:32.060]  few states, they, they, they shut all that down. And now it's like, hey, we're taking over the party.
[1:13:32.060 --> 1:13:35.900]  Thanks for the, you know, $50 million you gave us the last two election cycles.
[1:13:35.900 --> 1:13:43.340]  And then they pass over in all these states, people who've got great records and who are
[1:13:43.340 --> 1:13:49.500]  constitutionalists for people like Mr. Cruz here in Texas, who's pro-property taxes and a globalist.
[1:13:53.900 --> 1:13:58.540]  I mean, look, what's happening is you're not taking over the Republicans. They're taking you over
[1:13:58.540 --> 1:14:03.820]  when we had a real chance to really take over the Republican Party. And so we're going to state this.
[1:14:03.820 --> 1:14:08.060]  I know there's a bunch of camp followers that want to be able to hang out with the senators and be
[1:14:08.060 --> 1:14:13.660]  part of all people they elect in this new Republican power move. It, it isn't anything if it's just
[1:14:13.660 --> 1:14:18.540]  bought and paid for by the same special interest. And I know I'm ranting now, so we'll go to your calls.
[1:14:20.140 --> 1:14:25.820]  But just look at these headlines here. Ron Paul still isn't sure if he's going to his own Republican
[1:14:25.820 --> 1:14:31.820]  convention festival business insider. That's freaking people out. David Adams, the former head
[1:14:31.820 --> 1:14:37.980]  manager for Paul's Republican primary campaign in 2010 said, you know, his first thought is that
[1:14:37.980 --> 1:14:42.540]  Ron suffered from Stockholm syndrome. I met with a Coast Guard guy, a really nice fellow
[1:14:44.060 --> 1:14:49.740]  a few months ago who was here in town visiting, was at family with his girlfriend. And we went and
[1:14:49.740 --> 1:14:54.620]  had, had, had lunch and talked and, you know, he was like, I'm a little concerned, but, you know,
[1:14:54.620 --> 1:14:59.180]  about playing politics, but, but, but, and, and where things were going and the people in the
[1:14:59.180 --> 1:15:03.020]  campaign were concerned. I, and that wasn't off record. I mean, Rand knew he was at that meeting
[1:15:03.020 --> 1:15:08.780]  with me. I've talked to other people that are off record. Some of them aren't off record,
[1:15:08.780 --> 1:15:12.220]  but I'm still not going to say what they told me three, four months ago that was concerned. I'm
[1:15:12.220 --> 1:15:17.980]  like, Oh, I'm sure it'll be all right. Well, again, I think it's just the, the upset is the
[1:15:17.980 --> 1:15:25.100]  realization that things have really changed. And later after I go to calls, I'm going to read over
[1:15:25.100 --> 1:15:30.460]  this big article that's got a transcript of the interview he did with Peter Schiff and the video
[1:15:30.460 --> 1:15:36.700]  of it. I'm supporting the party that I belong to. Rand Paul speaks about Romney endorsement.
[1:15:36.700 --> 1:15:42.780]  There are definitely things in between good and evil. There are definitely things in between
[1:15:42.780 --> 1:15:48.220]  good and evil. So he's not just saying lesser of two evils. It's now there's things in between
[1:15:48.220 --> 1:15:53.340]  good and evil. Yeah. I mean, if Romney hadn't called for assault weapons bands for 20 plus years and
[1:15:53.340 --> 1:15:58.620]  passed anti gun laws in the state he was in, if Romney hadn't been such a pusher of abortion,
[1:15:58.620 --> 1:16:03.260]  if he hadn't written Obama care, if he hadn't pushed for open borders and amnesty, if he hadn't
[1:16:03.260 --> 1:16:07.980]  pushed for carbon taxes, if he hadn't been been involved in banker bailouts, if he hadn't been
[1:16:07.980 --> 1:16:14.860]  involved in so much bad, there might be a, I mean, I mean, you could say, well, this guy
[1:16:14.860 --> 1:16:17.980]  isn't perfect, but we can try to influence him. You know, he's better than Obama, but folks,
[1:16:17.980 --> 1:16:23.260]  he isn't. In fact, he's worse in ways because he has an R before his name and all the conservatives
[1:16:23.260 --> 1:16:27.580]  and libertarians that were starting to wake up under Obama, they're going to go to sleep because
[1:16:27.580 --> 1:16:32.380]  there's this idea that all these Democrats were upset about warrantless wiretaps, checkpoints,
[1:16:32.380 --> 1:16:37.500]  secret arrest, torture wars. As soon as Obama got in, they're like, we love torture. We love war.
[1:16:37.500 --> 1:16:42.220]  We love NDAA. We love banker bailouts. And we're like, you didn't like under Bush.
[1:16:42.220 --> 1:16:47.180]  They didn't care. It's going to be the exact same thing. Do I want Obama in? No. Justice be done.
[1:16:47.180 --> 1:16:51.900]  May the heavens fall. I want Obama to go to prison. Let me tell you, the Republicans went
[1:16:51.900 --> 1:16:57.020]  after Obama for fast and furious, his line started impeaching him. Then there were indictments. I
[1:16:57.020 --> 1:17:00.940]  would say, whoa, the power structure really understands things are going down if we don't
[1:17:00.940 --> 1:17:05.740]  reverse this. Okay. Yeah, I'm for the Republicans, but you're not going to see any of that.
[1:17:06.860 --> 1:17:13.500]  You're seeing some election time patty cake out there where they are. Oh, we're going to subpoena
[1:17:13.500 --> 1:17:20.380]  you. We're going to start the debate on you being in contempt holder. Holder is in press
[1:17:20.380 --> 1:17:25.340]  conferences two and a half years ago, admitting they had a gun running program by name, just
[1:17:25.340 --> 1:17:29.500]  claiming it was something else and that he directed it and was running it with the FBI.
[1:17:29.500 --> 1:17:34.460]  There's eight federal agencies involved. It predates him. They just accelerated it,
[1:17:34.460 --> 1:17:39.660]  included hangar dates, full auto, and in a drug gangs in the US to control it.
[1:17:39.660 --> 1:17:45.100]  But Bush was involved as well. That's why Holder said that. I predicted he would say that. Again,
[1:17:45.100 --> 1:17:50.620]  I know how they operate. They're so corrupt, none of them can report on the other ones now
[1:17:51.820 --> 1:17:56.300]  because, oh, you're going to go after the UN for sex slavery. You're going to have the
[1:17:56.300 --> 1:18:02.540]  UN for narcotics trafficking. We'll go after your bank for doing that. Or you're going to go
[1:18:02.540 --> 1:18:07.020]  after our politician for this. We're going to go after you for that. They all know the NSA has it
[1:18:07.020 --> 1:18:12.700]  all logged and whoever the president is and whoever the CIA director is, they got access to all that.
[1:18:12.700 --> 1:18:17.020]  And when they leave office, the Clintons still run Washington to a great extent because they took
[1:18:17.020 --> 1:18:22.140]  all those files with them and they use them against everybody. And they know everything,
[1:18:22.700 --> 1:18:28.540]  everything, what hooker somebody visited, what prostitute they visited, what bribe they took.
[1:18:28.540 --> 1:18:35.420]  They know all of it. And so there's this unified corruption now rotting to the point of we're
[1:18:35.420 --> 1:18:40.940]  now going into terminal corruption where at every level, nobody can say no because nobody
[1:18:40.940 --> 1:18:44.860]  will call on the other group because even if you're involved in just a little bit of corruption,
[1:18:45.740 --> 1:18:50.300]  they're going to get you on it. Or you just want your job and your pension if you're really low
[1:18:50.300 --> 1:18:56.060]  level, so you better keep your mouth shut. And so we lose everything. This is how society's fall.
[1:18:56.060 --> 1:19:00.860]  And no amount of, it's like cockroaches when you spray them with poison, they start running around
[1:19:00.860 --> 1:19:06.540]  eating and fornicating because they know they're about to die. And so 30,000 drones, checkpoints,
[1:19:06.540 --> 1:19:11.580]  pillboxes, bullets, none of that's going to save you from your own theft. The trillion stolen every
[1:19:11.580 --> 1:19:19.900]  few years by the Pentagon, the no bid contracts, the government just in everyone's face, the inexorable
[1:19:19.900 --> 1:19:23.660]  confrontations that will come. All right, we're going to come back, take a few segments of calls,
[1:19:23.660 --> 1:19:28.300]  then I'll get into the news. But there's your big rant on that subject and I will get into the
[1:19:28.300 --> 1:19:33.420]  amazing quotes. I mean, here's the description science monitor. Is Ron Paul getting ready to
[1:19:33.420 --> 1:19:38.140]  endorse Mitt Romney? And then it shows how the press releases they're putting out are like,
[1:19:38.140 --> 1:19:44.300]  settle down, be nice. I may not go to the event you set up for me to have our own convention.
[1:19:44.300 --> 1:19:49.820]  No, we're not outsiders now. We've been, what's happened is they have married campaign for liberty
[1:19:49.820 --> 1:19:53.820]  and all their little comb over advisors, you think they're Carl Roves in the making,
[1:19:53.820 --> 1:19:57.900]  they have married them to the Republicans and there's a big power trip going on. And we're
[1:19:57.900 --> 1:20:04.860]  supposed to just kneel down and go, okay. Folks, have you lost your power and wanted
[1:20:04.860 --> 1:20:09.500]  to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on? If so, this is going to be the most important
[1:20:09.500 --> 1:20:13.740]  message you'll ever hear because there's never been a better time to get ready for the winter
[1:20:13.740 --> 1:20:19.260]  power outages ahead. Here's why solar power generators are now available from our friends
[1:20:19.260 --> 1:20:24.380]  at solutions from science, one of our oldest sponsors. Their emergency backup systems provide
[1:20:24.380 --> 1:20:29.340]  life saving electrical power when you need it most. Unlike gas generators, a solar generator
[1:20:29.340 --> 1:20:34.220]  runs quietly amidst no fumes and produces electricity from the sun. It's like having
[1:20:34.220 --> 1:20:38.780]  an electric power plant running quietly in your own own, whether it's ice storms,
[1:20:38.780 --> 1:20:43.340]  brown ounce or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[1:20:43.340 --> 1:20:47.740]  When the power goes out this winter, you'll be ready with a solar power generator from
[1:20:47.740 --> 1:20:53.740]  solutions from science. Go to mysolarbackup.com for more information. That's mysolarbackup.com

[1:24:07.420 --> 1:24:11.660]  I just can't get over this headline at MFullWars.com with the video of him saying it.
[1:24:12.460 --> 1:24:16.780]  Fat guys, you have that interview, you isolate the part where he says there are definitely
[1:24:16.780 --> 1:24:22.460]  things between good and evil. Yeah, that's how everybody always starts
[1:24:22.460 --> 1:24:26.060]  selling out to corruption and pretty soon you hit rock bottom.
[1:24:27.580 --> 1:24:32.220]  Man, I tell you, I just, I want to get off this Rand Paul subject. Every day I tell myself I'm
[1:24:32.220 --> 1:24:38.940]  not going to cover it. And then every day I just see that I was right about my initial gag reflex.
[1:24:39.660 --> 1:24:42.860]  I mean, one thing of Rand Paul would have come out and said, well, I disagree with a lot of what
[1:24:42.860 --> 1:24:45.980]  he stands for, but he's better than Obama, which really that wouldn't be true either.
[1:24:46.540 --> 1:24:51.420]  But we're going to try to influence him. It was like, no, he is the man. And by the way,
[1:24:51.420 --> 1:24:55.980]  we may not have that other conference and you be respectful and, you know,
[1:24:55.980 --> 1:25:00.220]  let's endorse a bunch of CFR people. And if you don't like it, grow up.
[1:25:00.780 --> 1:25:05.260]  All right, I'm going to shut up. Shut up, Jones, to take calls. George in Florida, go ahead.
[1:25:07.580 --> 1:25:15.100]  Yes, Alex, I'm 75 years of age and may have a slightly different perspective on the Rand Paul
[1:25:15.100 --> 1:25:22.940]  thing. Yes, tell me. All right. You're a warrior and I greatly respect you and the Bilderberg stuff
[1:25:22.940 --> 1:25:29.900]  was great. But Ron at his age is more like a sage and he's been giving out a message for years.
[1:25:30.540 --> 1:25:38.220]  I don't think he's afraid of threats against his own life. But I think he, what happened in
[1:25:38.220 --> 1:25:44.220]  Louisiana with the caucus and what happened to his head man there being knocked down by the police
[1:25:44.220 --> 1:25:50.220]  and dragged out and put in the hospital could have affected him dearly because he does not want his
[1:25:50.220 --> 1:25:54.780]  people to suffer that kind of injury. Yeah, well, the founding fathers didn't want us to suffer any
[1:25:54.780 --> 1:25:59.980]  injury. We would have been total slaves of a bunch of them hadn't died. I mean, I just, I don't
[1:25:59.980 --> 1:26:05.900]  think we can twist things to make all of what's going on. Okay, because if we do this, they're
[1:26:05.900 --> 1:26:11.420]  going to turn completely into neocon land, at least Rand is, we've got a hope here of spanking
[1:26:11.420 --> 1:26:16.860]  them back onto the, you know, narrow here. But again, the Liberty movement, Ron Paul and Rand
[1:26:16.860 --> 1:26:23.580]  Paul are popular because we've made freedom popular. You've done it, sir. Yes, I gave money to
[1:26:23.580 --> 1:26:32.700]  their campaigns and I'm on social security and I am disappointed. But I think as a lone messenger
[1:26:32.700 --> 1:26:39.100]  for all those years, Ron Paul is a brave man. And I agree with you, but their campaign people who
[1:26:39.100 --> 1:26:44.780]  speak for them are being condescending. They're not saying we understand your view, but you know,
[1:26:44.780 --> 1:26:50.460]  listen, no, it's, it's like, well, you're just stupid. And okay, fine, then you made your bed,
[1:26:50.460 --> 1:26:56.380]  sleep in it. We got a poll running right now 85% disagree with what Rand's done at info wars.com.
[1:26:57.260 --> 1:27:05.900]  May I say that since I'm 75 and Ron Paul 76, what if we were to find out six months or a year from
[1:27:05.900 --> 1:27:11.500]  now that he or, or his wife had been diagnosed with terminal cancer? No, I understand. Listen,
[1:27:11.500 --> 1:27:17.260]  I told, we attack him and throw him under the bus or say thank you for the years you've put in. I
[1:27:17.260 --> 1:27:22.540]  as an older person, I'm just saying we should be a little bit kinder and gentler toward Ron Paul
[1:27:22.540 --> 1:27:27.740]  and not throw him under the bus. I hear you. Listen, I feel like I've been thrown under the
[1:27:27.740 --> 1:27:33.100]  bus. So let's get that straight. We're not throwing anybody under the bus. We're upset
[1:27:33.100 --> 1:27:39.340]  about what happened and we're getting feedback that we're bad because not from the listeners,
[1:27:39.340 --> 1:27:45.180]  you're one of the few callers that disagrees, but, but from, from the establishment that we just
[1:27:45.180 --> 1:27:50.380]  don't get it. No, no, we get how the compromising works. We liked Ron Paul because he never did
[1:27:50.380 --> 1:27:55.660]  compromise. And if I was diagnosed with terminal cancer, I would get even more hardcore in what
[1:27:55.660 --> 1:28:03.340]  I believed in. I certainly wouldn't back off. And maybe they know what they're doing. Maybe,
[1:28:03.340 --> 1:28:07.020]  maybe they realize they've got so much power in the Republican party that if they just
[1:28:07.020 --> 1:28:10.940]  play possum, they can really get in there. And maybe down the road, I'll, I'll say,
[1:28:10.940 --> 1:28:15.580]  well, my initial look, my gut tells me this is bad. My gut told me stuff was going wrong
[1:28:15.580 --> 1:28:21.020]  months ago, but I denied my gut. And, and Louisiana on that Tuesday, a week or so ago,
[1:28:21.020 --> 1:28:29.660]  so when they, uh, the Republican guy in charge of the caucus, supposedly 181 out of a 121 out
[1:28:29.660 --> 1:28:35.980]  of 180 delegates in Louisiana where Ron Paul people, they called in a Shreveport police and
[1:28:35.980 --> 1:28:39.980]  they knocked this guy down and put him in the hospital. He was so blood red in the face.
[1:28:39.980 --> 1:28:44.460]  I thought he'd have a heart attack. No. And, and Ron Paul's response is you be respectful. It's
[1:28:44.460 --> 1:28:49.420]  his fault. And now that, I mean, they're talking about not even going and meeting with their
[1:28:49.420 --> 1:28:53.980]  supporters at the event because they know they're so mad. It's a great disappointment.
[1:28:53.980 --> 1:29:00.300]  I just wanted to give a point of view of a 75 year old. I think Ron Paul, uh, has, uh,
[1:29:00.300 --> 1:29:05.580]  we all have human failures. Sir, I hear you and I appreciate your points. Thank you. Listen,
[1:29:05.580 --> 1:29:08.780]  you're not, you're not getting it. A hundred years old, 25 years old.
[1:29:11.260 --> 1:29:16.460]  It, people say, Oh, Ron Paul isn't Rand. That was the first talking point. Look, they, he
[1:29:16.460 --> 1:29:21.740]  cons, they coordinated his release. That made me upset that, okay, we're not going to win with
[1:29:21.740 --> 1:29:25.420]  the delegates now. Well, they knew that months before, but strung people along. I didn't like
[1:29:25.420 --> 1:29:28.940]  watching people get played like that. Like cult members running around in front of me,
[1:29:28.940 --> 1:29:33.100]  even in my office. Well, I was like, dude, this isn't going to happen. Okay. They're doing this
[1:29:33.100 --> 1:29:37.820]  just to continue to keep momentum going. Okay. Oh no, Alex, we're going to win. It's going to
[1:29:37.820 --> 1:29:42.860]  happen. He's going to do something big. I'm like, no, he's not. And, and then he coordinates the day
[1:29:42.860 --> 1:29:48.540]  that his son goes and endorses Mitt Romney on Sean Hannity and then all the other coordinations.
[1:29:49.740 --> 1:29:56.380]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:30:00.460 --> 1:30:05.100]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[1:30:05.100 --> 1:30:09.180]  and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[1:30:09.180 --> 1:30:13.740]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold. It's true. Seeds have all performed
[1:30:13.740 --> 1:30:17.980]  even gold and silver before in this country. And it's possible that could even happen again.
[1:30:17.980 --> 1:30:23.180]  So our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[1:30:23.180 --> 1:30:29.100]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food
[1:30:29.100 --> 1:30:33.660]  for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically modified in
[1:30:33.660 --> 1:30:38.860]  any way. And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden. So visit them
[1:30:38.860 --> 1:30:48.060]  today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[1:30:48.060 --> 1:30:57.100]  That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[1:30:57.100 --> 1:31:03.180]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com. You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs
[1:31:03.180 --> 1:31:08.220]  Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions.
[1:31:08.220 --> 1:31:12.060]  Yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been

[1:31:32.220 --> 1:31:39.580]  key target areas. This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin,
[1:31:39.580 --> 1:31:44.300]  and orally for the digestive system. Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the

[1:33:02.860 --> 1:33:09.100]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:12.220 --> 1:33:15.580]  All right, giant news blitz coming up here in about 10 minutes. I've got to start getting
[1:33:15.580 --> 1:33:20.780]  to more of this news. It's all just crazy and very important to paint a tapestry of what's
[1:33:20.780 --> 1:33:25.900]  a gestalt of what's going on so we can look into that field of data and
[1:33:27.820 --> 1:33:34.060]  attend our course. But right now let's go to Chris in Florida. You're on the air. Welcome.
[1:33:35.020 --> 1:33:38.940]  How you doing, Alex? I'm a first-time caller. I'm not going to take up too much of your time.
[1:33:38.940 --> 1:33:42.380]  I just had one statement I wanted to make and then I had a quick question for you.
[1:33:42.380 --> 1:33:47.020]  Yeah, go ahead, brother. My statement is I just wanted to let you know
[1:33:47.020 --> 1:33:51.660]  that your message is reaching the masses. I don't really get into the award shows,
[1:33:51.660 --> 1:33:55.500]  but my wife asked me to sit down and watch the MTV Movie Awards with her.
[1:33:56.060 --> 1:34:01.740]  And in Russell Brand's opening statement, he threw in a bunch of comments about global
[1:34:01.740 --> 1:34:09.500]  elitists running the world from the shadows. And when he signed off for the night, he ended
[1:34:09.500 --> 1:34:14.300]  it by saying, long live the revolution. I don't know if you guys had people that could like
[1:34:14.300 --> 1:34:20.380]  to listen. I was listening to XM this morning driving in. I think I was listening to the
[1:34:20.380 --> 1:34:23.740]  Boneyard, one of the rock channels just going through and I heard the lady going,
[1:34:23.740 --> 1:34:29.580]  there's a movement against children being able to have lemonade stands and learn the
[1:34:29.580 --> 1:34:33.820]  free market system. The federal government's out of control and it's part of a plan to
[1:34:33.820 --> 1:34:38.700]  track everything we do. And I only caught part of it and she said, so get behind this national
[1:34:38.700 --> 1:34:43.500]  movement today. Guys, will you look up a national movement for lemonade stands today or this week
[1:34:43.500 --> 1:34:47.980]  coming up? I mean, I don't know what the point is. I meant to actually left my cell phone at home,
[1:34:47.980 --> 1:34:51.820]  so I couldn't call you guys from the road. So I forgot about that. I'd already left and didn't
[1:34:51.820 --> 1:34:58.380]  have the little data tracker. So I was unable to do that. But and all the time now, I listened to
[1:34:58.380 --> 1:35:04.700]  local radio, national radio. I'll be listening to a country music station. There are liberty
[1:35:04.700 --> 1:35:10.540]  lovers everywhere who are really realizing this is serious and they can't stop everybody in the
[1:35:10.540 --> 1:35:15.820]  media if we all just start going public. And that's what's happening all over the place.
[1:35:15.820 --> 1:35:19.340]  Mainstream news is reporting on Bilderberg all over the place. People are talking about
[1:35:20.300 --> 1:35:26.460]  the GMO in the food. I'm sorry. Go ahead. This was broadcasted across the world, Alex. And he made
[1:35:26.460 --> 1:35:31.900]  more than one comment about the globalist. Okay. Well, I know that's exciting because
[1:35:32.540 --> 1:35:36.860]  I don't use the only links they have on their official site, one of the top bands out there.
[1:35:36.860 --> 1:35:40.860]  I've had him on. He's a listener, Bellamy. They talk about the New World Order.
[1:35:41.900 --> 1:35:45.100]  Almost every big rock band I end up talking to, I don't care if it's...
[1:35:47.340 --> 1:35:50.780]  I mean, you name it. Well, some people want to be off records. I won't say their names, but
[1:35:52.060 --> 1:35:59.580]  it's pretty incredible is all I can say. How many people are awake? But again, most of them don't
[1:35:59.580 --> 1:36:04.540]  want to go public. They just think that I'm a touchstone. And if they give me a call or something
[1:36:04.540 --> 1:36:08.300]  that, hey, we appreciate what you're doing. We know what's happening. And I'm like, why don't you
[1:36:08.300 --> 1:36:12.940]  come on the show? And they're like, oh, it's a little too scary, but maybe someday. Okay, fine.
[1:36:12.940 --> 1:36:18.060]  And again, there's no way to even really contact me other than email or through my intermediaries
[1:36:18.060 --> 1:36:23.420]  because I'm too busy. So sometimes I talk to famous people who've been trying to get in hold of me
[1:36:23.420 --> 1:36:31.100]  for two years. And again, I'm not bragging. I'm saying that's a sounding board. That's a sonar
[1:36:31.100 --> 1:36:38.940]  peeing of how many people are awake. Go ahead. My question is my youngest child, he's four,
[1:36:38.940 --> 1:36:46.060]  he'll be five next month. He does have a pretty significant developmental delay. He's four going
[1:36:46.060 --> 1:36:52.220]  on five. The doctor said in his mind, he's more like three going on four. So he's about a year
[1:36:52.220 --> 1:36:58.860]  behind. And I'm trying to enroll him for school next year, but I don't want to vaccinate him.
[1:36:58.860 --> 1:37:03.580]  And they're telling me here in Florida that there's no way I can put him in public school
[1:37:03.580 --> 1:37:09.180]  without him getting his vaccination because I'm pretty sure the delays that he has are
[1:37:09.820 --> 1:37:14.540]  directly related to. Yeah, but they want to they want to brain damage him more. You see,
[1:37:15.260 --> 1:37:25.260]  it is genetically predisposed that the the aluminum dioxide and other chemicals are causing
[1:37:25.260 --> 1:37:30.380]  the autoimmune response in his brain. And then genetically, some people, especially boys in
[1:37:30.380 --> 1:37:36.620]  general, but across the board blacks, it's even worse, black, black males, that it causes a really
[1:37:36.620 --> 1:37:43.660]  bad autoimmune response in the brain. Women are designed to have another human grow inside them
[1:37:43.660 --> 1:37:49.740]  with a different blood type. So women on average have less allergies, can take bigger abuse to
[1:37:49.740 --> 1:37:55.420]  their bodies. They're not as physically strong, but they're, but they're health wise, much,
[1:37:55.420 --> 1:38:00.780]  much stronger. They can't bench press as much, but they can take bigger, bigger gun wounds,
[1:38:01.580 --> 1:38:06.860]  hatchet attacks, drugs, poison, women are any doctor will tell you much tougher than men.
[1:38:07.420 --> 1:38:12.940]  And so it's killing our boys. It's a lot of them die when they get the shots. Now the pediatric
[1:38:12.940 --> 1:38:18.540]  associations are having to say it's normal to have a seizure. Now when you get your shot,
[1:38:18.540 --> 1:38:23.660]  everything's okay. So, so don't bring your kid back in. So they have to do the adverse reaction
[1:38:23.660 --> 1:38:27.660]  report. Just go home, have a seizure. Even if you're four year old or two year old,
[1:38:27.660 --> 1:38:35.740]  don't ever talk again. That's normal. And here's the total fraud. There is a religious exemption.
[1:38:35.740 --> 1:38:41.580]  There is also a conscientious objection and a medical exemption in Florida. Some states only
[1:38:41.580 --> 1:38:46.620]  have two. I remember from guys pull up a vaccine exemption, Florida, and we'll give the guy the
[1:38:46.620 --> 1:38:53.260]  actual law. But the criminals at the brainwashing filthy murderous government death camp known as
[1:38:53.260 --> 1:38:58.460]  a public school where your child will learn how to use drugs and be picked on by bullies and become
[1:38:58.460 --> 1:39:03.420]  sexually active and live in hell and be in pecked and be put in the database and filmed in the
[1:39:03.420 --> 1:39:08.220]  bathroom. Those hardcore criminals who just think it's normal, we've got to tell them, no, you're
[1:39:08.220 --> 1:39:15.420]  hardcore criminals. They lie because when they get 97% vaccination, a vaccination rates, brain
[1:39:15.420 --> 1:39:22.140]  damage rates, murder rates, they get a big part of their federal funding. Large parts, I think
[1:39:22.140 --> 1:39:26.700]  it's up to $2,000 per student on average. That's more than a third. Oh no, the average student
[1:39:26.700 --> 1:39:32.220]  costs 7,000. So it's under a third. But they get a lot of their federal funding where they take
[1:39:32.220 --> 1:39:37.500]  our money and send it back, globalist funding, when they've had all the shots. There is no law.
[1:39:37.500 --> 1:39:44.300]  The exemption is to the state health department policy. Like Rick Perry came out and said,
[1:39:44.300 --> 1:39:49.660]  it's the law. All girls must take Gardasil ages 12 and 13. Tens of thousands went out,
[1:39:49.660 --> 1:39:54.380]  took them, a bunch died, a bunch of died in the trials. Didn't matter. Vaccine damage money
[1:39:54.380 --> 1:40:01.340]  kicked in. Once the government mandates it, it's not the law, but they mandate it. Then
[1:40:01.340 --> 1:40:08.620]  vaccine taxpayer money kicks in to pay for the damages. They are lying to you when they tell you
[1:40:08.620 --> 1:40:15.660]  that it is the law and you're not going to go to public school. It is a total and complete fraud
[1:40:15.660 --> 1:40:21.500]  on screen. I have the state exemptions, available exemptions, medical and religious. And it goes
[1:40:21.500 --> 1:40:28.380]  on. Religious exemption request must be presented to DH form 681, religious exemption form
[1:40:28.380 --> 1:40:33.420]  immunization, which is to be issued by the county health departments. And again, it's not to a law,
[1:40:33.420 --> 1:40:37.740]  it's to the health department. You notice I told you that before they put it on screen.
[1:40:37.740 --> 1:40:43.900]  So imagine the savage, rageful, deceptive. I mean, let me tell you something. If I was in a school
[1:40:43.900 --> 1:40:49.820]  and some dirty principal or some dirty murdering nurse, that's what they are, sat there like a punk
[1:40:49.820 --> 1:40:54.860]  and told me, sorry, it's the law. Knowing it's the law, they've got to give you the exemption.
[1:40:54.860 --> 1:40:58.620]  And then planning if your child's already in school and hadn't taken the next round,
[1:40:58.620 --> 1:41:04.620]  they will arrest you by kicking them out of school, saying they're truant, and then saying you
[1:41:04.620 --> 1:41:10.860]  created the truancy when they falsely kicked you out. And the law is applicable on them,
[1:41:10.860 --> 1:41:19.340]  not you, another criminal, racketeering mafia operation. I mean, think of the scum.
[1:41:19.340 --> 1:41:25.100]  Tell me about the filth that's told you it's the law in Florida. Your child must be further soft
[1:41:25.100 --> 1:41:30.300]  killed. Yep. They told me there was no way I could get him in public schools without the proper
[1:41:30.300 --> 1:41:40.220]  vaccination. Filthy scum, criminal, lying, garbage. Again, when Austin, we've had top scientists,
[1:41:40.220 --> 1:41:46.220]  doctors, toxicologists, heads of university departments come to them and the mayor gets
[1:41:46.220 --> 1:41:52.460]  up and laughs and walks off. They put in Austin over 200, some cities over 300,
[1:41:52.460 --> 1:42:01.260]  chemicals, lead, mercury, radioactive isotopes, and fluoride in your water and savagely assaults you
[1:42:01.260 --> 1:42:06.060]  and then laugh at you when you go down there. I mean, these are, see, we've lost our human
[1:42:06.060 --> 1:42:12.460]  response. So again, did you call the filth? Did you call the school? Were you there in person?
[1:42:12.460 --> 1:42:17.900]  Because you should go in there with a- I went to the school in person. I called the health
[1:42:17.900 --> 1:42:22.780]  department. I have not been to the health department yet. This all transpired last week.
[1:42:22.780 --> 1:42:27.340]  Did the health department lie to you too? I mean, hey, they're like, listen, listen, Chris. Chris,
[1:42:27.340 --> 1:42:32.940]  your son's only partially brain damage. We want to kill your little boy. So don't get out of our
[1:42:32.940 --> 1:42:37.340]  way and let us kill him. Please, please, Chris. Don't listen to all the shows. Don't get angry
[1:42:37.340 --> 1:42:41.980]  about us lying. Number one, there is no law. It's an exemption to a policy. Do you understand?
[1:42:41.980 --> 1:42:45.180]  So the health department lied to you. Of course they did. They're criminals.
[1:42:45.180 --> 1:42:54.220]  Well, I tell my nine-year-old all the stuff that I learn in my research from you,
[1:42:55.340 --> 1:43:00.620]  from other patriots out there on the internet. And my nine-year-old knows if they try to give him
[1:43:00.620 --> 1:43:06.940]  a needle in school that he is to absolutely tell them no. And by the way, we learned this a decade
[1:43:06.940 --> 1:43:11.340]  ago. People didn't believe it. Now it's all of the news. Oh, we accidentally lined up all the six
[1:43:11.340 --> 1:43:14.780]  year olds. They do it to really little kids. That's all abusers of children target. They're really
[1:43:14.780 --> 1:43:18.140]  little ones because they can't, you know, aren't as articulate, especially because they've had their
[1:43:18.140 --> 1:43:22.300]  shots. And they line them up and they go, oh, we thought you wanted your child to have it.
[1:43:23.580 --> 1:43:29.260]  See, the criminality of lying has gone to now shooting them up and not telling you.
[1:43:29.260 --> 1:43:33.100]  Then they have a seizures when you usually find out they're like, yeah, we gave him a shot.
[1:43:33.100 --> 1:43:37.660]  You said you could. You're like, no, I didn't. I specifically put a letter in. Oh, sorry,
[1:43:38.300 --> 1:43:43.420]  SWAT team standing by. If you don't like it, Jack, SWAT, we're going to assault your family.
[1:43:43.420 --> 1:43:48.300]  And again, now it's the point in California and other states, they go give your child the shot
[1:43:48.300 --> 1:43:53.660]  without consent. If they can convince your 10 year old to let them do it. Well, the children can't
[1:43:53.660 --> 1:43:58.860]  give consent. Again, this is a criminal rogue, filthy. And listen, you hit my hot button right
[1:43:58.860 --> 1:44:02.380]  there, brother. So you went, you call the health department. They lied to you. You went into the
[1:44:02.380 --> 1:44:07.580]  school. Tell us the story. His parents should start going in with hidden cameras. He was,
[1:44:07.580 --> 1:44:15.660]  he was four this year and he went into a pre-K program for children with developmental delays.
[1:44:16.220 --> 1:44:24.060]  And I even gave his pre-K teacher, who is a special education teacher, a copy of the article
[1:44:24.060 --> 1:44:31.340]  and the research that you posted in reference to the vaccines giving monkeys autism. And
[1:44:32.540 --> 1:44:37.340]  it doesn't matter. Listen, that person's there to get their paycheck.
[1:44:37.340 --> 1:44:43.100]  That person, you don't convince a lying criminal. So you talk to the, was it the nurse
[1:44:43.100 --> 1:44:49.260]  or the scumbag principal? I talked to the vice principal. Okay. So the scumbag criminal,
[1:44:49.260 --> 1:44:55.340]  you should sue them for fraud and for racketeering for lying and saying a medical procedure was
[1:44:55.340 --> 1:45:00.780]  mandatory and misrepresenting a non-existent law. Okay. It's nice. Being nice to these people,
[1:45:00.780 --> 1:45:07.980]  it's over. Okay. Their mind game is over. Shooting black men up with syphilis and
[1:45:07.980 --> 1:45:13.340]  are now our troops with it. It's over. It's over. The experimentation, the DU, it's over.
[1:45:13.340 --> 1:45:17.340]  It's over. And you got all these cowards that go along with it. Do you understand that filthy
[1:45:17.340 --> 1:45:22.700]  principal knew that by law, they were supposed to give you the waiver that was in their filing
[1:45:22.700 --> 1:45:28.380]  cabinet. Do you understand that? I do now. Do you understand they were praying on you?
[1:45:28.380 --> 1:45:33.580]  Okay. I mean, listen, I'm not a guy looking for trouble, but that's like fighting stuff. You
[1:45:33.580 --> 1:45:37.500]  understand? I mean, I would have trouble in there. If I went in knowing they were going to lie and
[1:45:37.500 --> 1:45:43.180]  the guy said, it's the law. I'd say, listen, you filthy piece of trash. Millions of children
[1:45:43.180 --> 1:45:48.460]  are brain damage from one and 25,000 to one and 58. Pediatric cancers are up over 10,000%.
[1:45:48.460 --> 1:45:53.580]  I knew you were going to lie. You see my hat? It's got a camera in it. Here is the government's
[1:45:53.580 --> 1:45:58.380]  own report about over a hundred million people getting cancer from the fifties through the eighties
[1:45:58.380 --> 1:46:05.260]  from HV 40 alone in the polio vaccine. Now, also it's on the video. I want you to know,
[1:46:05.260 --> 1:46:09.420]  I video taped all this and I'm going to, I'm going to expose you through criminality, admit
[1:46:09.420 --> 1:46:13.340]  that you have a waiver and that's not even a waiver to a law and then get them to admit it
[1:46:13.340 --> 1:46:18.860]  or wait until they say it and lie to you and say there's no waiver and then tell them you're taping
[1:46:18.860 --> 1:46:23.980]  them. It's time to start getting aggressive with the buckets of filth that are the criminal
[1:46:23.980 --> 1:46:29.500]  government and corporate enforcers who want to assault our families. Where is our fighting spirit?
[1:46:30.300 --> 1:46:33.820]  So, so, so tell me what this, this Decepticon told you.
[1:46:35.420 --> 1:46:41.740]  He, his, his only response was that you cannot register a child for public schools
[1:46:42.300 --> 1:46:48.220]  in the state of Florida without the proper vaccination either from his primary doctor
[1:46:48.220 --> 1:46:54.620]  or the health department. It's amazing. All right. I am going to tell us the name of school.
[1:46:56.620 --> 1:47:03.100]  Pride elementary. Well, here's the deal. This is done everywhere. So I knew exactly what he'd
[1:47:03.100 --> 1:47:07.500]  say to you. And let me guess, he said, it's going to be all right. Did you try to put his hand on
[1:47:07.500 --> 1:47:11.580]  your arms? He's like, we got to get this in the kid to get the money. I want to go play golf today.
[1:47:11.580 --> 1:47:20.460]  Oh, he was authoritative with you. He was like somewhat. I will be back at the school though
[1:47:20.460 --> 1:47:26.620]  with this new information about this waiver. They, they, they, they haven't heard the last of me and
[1:47:27.500 --> 1:47:30.700]  I have to do everything in my power to keep those needles from going in my chair.
[1:47:30.700 --> 1:47:36.380]  Well, again, again, how do these scumbags get away with all this? They do it through ignorance.
[1:47:36.380 --> 1:47:43.100]  The people perish for lack of knowledge. Again, do we compromise with a system engaged in medical
[1:47:43.100 --> 1:47:47.980]  tyranny that tens of thousands of our troops have been hit with nerve gas and biologicals and
[1:47:47.980 --> 1:47:54.220]  chemicals and tests, including killing them? And again, we're not in tens as folks. People are like,
[1:47:54.220 --> 1:47:58.780]  Oh, you're so brave. They may kill you. It doesn't matter. There's no future. We don't beat these
[1:47:58.780 --> 1:48:03.180]  people. Haven't anyone figured this out yet. I appreciate your call, sir. You really hit my
[1:48:03.180 --> 1:48:10.220]  hot button right there. Just type in vaccine exemption forms, the name of your state, and then
[1:48:10.220 --> 1:48:16.220]  all the parents listening, the doctors a decade ago, everywhere would say, there's no vermergery
[1:48:16.220 --> 1:48:21.900]  in the shots. That's a conspiracy theory. And I told people, okay, doc, okay, nurse, give me the
[1:48:21.900 --> 1:48:30.620]  insert to Marisol. What's that? Oh, mercury. Okay. Listen, they have criminal CPS and they,
[1:48:30.620 --> 1:48:35.500]  here's the problem. We have to say no now, just like they imply having guns is illegal and arrest
[1:48:35.500 --> 1:48:40.620]  people for legal guns now in this country. We have to speak out against it. They are already
[1:48:40.620 --> 1:48:47.580]  having CPS take people's children every week. I see reports where the parents say no to the shots,
[1:48:48.300 --> 1:48:52.940]  and there's no law, but they still just take them. And because there's no jury, it's a, you know,
[1:48:52.940 --> 1:48:59.100]  usually a pedophile. That's that we've profiled them or pervert judge. And like the Texas Youth
[1:48:59.100 --> 1:49:02.860]  Commission with their rape rooms for your child. I mean, these are, these are pedophiles. Of course,
[1:49:02.860 --> 1:49:07.740]  they're hiring pedophiles at all the TSA facilities to be the commanders. Who else do you think wants
[1:49:07.740 --> 1:49:13.740]  to do that? No one normal would do that. We have a hell force attacking us. A hell force has risen
[1:49:13.740 --> 1:49:20.060]  against us. They're all around us. And I declare war right back on you. You murdering self. Oh,
[1:49:20.060 --> 1:49:24.700]  man, I can't handle it anymore. I will not sit here while you brain damage and murder children
[1:49:24.700 --> 1:49:29.980]  anymore. I will not sit here while you radiate us and radiate our food anymore. I will not sit here
[1:49:29.980 --> 1:49:36.700]  while you genetically engineer soft kill weapons into our food. I will not sit here and take it
[1:49:36.700 --> 1:49:42.220]  anymore. When you get folks, if you woke up to what was really going on, you realize this is a
[1:49:42.220 --> 1:49:47.260]  completely normal response. I am desperately here begging you to break your trance.
[1:49:47.260 --> 1:49:53.500]  Nicholas in Illinois, you're on the air. Take us to break. Go ahead.
[1:49:56.540 --> 1:50:02.540]  Can you speak sir? The energy. Okay, Nana. Well, Nicholas, go, go, go, go.
[1:50:03.820 --> 1:50:07.820]  I'm going to continue with that guy I said prior about Russell Brandt. I thought that was really
[1:50:07.820 --> 1:50:12.460]  big of him calling out and I was commercially even mentioned the Illuminati. So I think you guys should
[1:50:12.460 --> 1:50:18.540]  contact and try to get him on. I don't know what you're talking about. Russell Brandt, he hosted
[1:50:18.540 --> 1:50:24.780]  the MTV Awards and he called out a bunch of the global elites and the Illuminati. The prior guy
[1:50:24.780 --> 1:50:30.300]  was. That's good. Who is who is Russell Brandt? He's been married to Katy Perry. He has a new
[1:50:30.300 --> 1:50:35.180]  show coming out, but he's kind of like a pop culture. He's an actor slash musician or whatever,
[1:50:35.180 --> 1:50:43.020]  but he called out to MTV, which is one of the largest. Largest brainwashing system, Jim.
[1:50:43.740 --> 1:50:48.620]  Exactly. I live in Chicago and do you guys have any stations that pick up your show?
[1:50:48.620 --> 1:50:53.260]  We're on a couple in Illinois. They're always changing and stuff. There's a list at GCMLive.com.
[1:50:53.260 --> 1:50:57.260]  Stay there. I'll come back to you on the other side. I didn't give you much time there. All right,
[1:50:57.260 --> 1:51:03.820]  stay with us. Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now
[1:51:03.820 --> 1:51:08.540]  storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a
[1:51:08.540 --> 1:51:13.100]  real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true,
[1:51:13.100 --> 1:51:16.780]  seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that
[1:51:16.780 --> 1:51:21.180]  could even happen again. So our friends at Solutions From Science have put together the

[1:53:55.660 --> 1:54:13.100]  ProEM1, the raw probiotic.
[1:54:13.100 --> 1:54:19.500]  Well, I've been in a total ranting rage during the break with the crew. They're angry. They're
[1:54:19.500 --> 1:54:23.660]  talking about, yeah, how they try to take blood at birth and then admit, okay, we are keeping it
[1:54:23.660 --> 1:54:29.660]  for research. That's now admitted. They just do whatever they want and how they lie and say
[1:54:29.660 --> 1:54:34.460]  pregnant women especially need all the vaccines. Until four years ago, every insert said, don't
[1:54:34.460 --> 1:54:39.500]  give it to a pregnant woman. Kids with heart trouble, they're trying to give vaccines and say,
[1:54:39.500 --> 1:54:46.220]  oh, your child needs more. It's eugenics to kill them. In all medical literature for the last
[1:54:46.220 --> 1:54:51.180]  hundred years, no vaccines for pregnant women. It causes autoimmune responses. All sorts of
[1:54:51.180 --> 1:54:56.860]  genetic disorders get kicked off by it. Autoimmune response, you lose your baby.
[1:54:58.380 --> 1:55:03.340]  And because of that, they decided to go all the way and starting three and a half years ago shared
[1:55:03.340 --> 1:55:08.060]  women especially who are pregnant needed and handicapped kids. And I have to watch them hurt
[1:55:08.060 --> 1:55:13.260]  in these little kids. It makes me so angry. And then I'm exhausted all day. I just want to beat
[1:55:13.260 --> 1:55:18.700]  these people. I want to put them all in prison too. Let me tell you something. That's a serious
[1:55:18.700 --> 1:55:24.060]  crime administrators to sit there and lie to the parents and say it's the law and then kick
[1:55:24.060 --> 1:55:29.820]  people's children out of the public schools. They do this all over the country. Oh, you didn't take
[1:55:29.820 --> 1:55:33.660]  your shots and then they kick you out and the cops come and arrest the parents for truancy.
[1:55:33.660 --> 1:55:38.940]  And it's all a giant fraud, but the juries are so dumb. Even the parents fight it. They're like,
[1:55:38.940 --> 1:55:45.740]  yep, your kid wasn't in school for a week. So you did take a shot. I've seen these people on the news.
[1:55:45.740 --> 1:55:55.340]  I mean, it's just all fraud. They're killing us. The same government that put US troops and chambers
[1:55:55.340 --> 1:56:00.940]  and radiated them to death and put foster kids in them, looking up is running this. They're killing
[1:56:00.940 --> 1:56:09.980]  us. They're killing us. And the globalists, they're murdering us. Let me say it again.
[1:56:09.980 --> 1:56:15.740]  They're murdering us. They're murdering us. It's Eugenics.
[1:56:18.140 --> 1:56:20.780]  Where's the last caller? Do you hang up? I said I'd come back to him after the break.
[1:56:21.660 --> 1:56:27.980]  Nana in Canada, you're on the air. Go ahead. Hey, how are you? I'm having a heart attack today.
[1:56:27.980 --> 1:56:32.380]  What's on your mind? I can see that. The only thing that I have to say is about the whole
[1:56:32.380 --> 1:56:38.060]  wrong, Paul and Rand Paul thing. My feeling is in my husband's feeling is imagine they did all
[1:56:38.060 --> 1:56:42.540]  this campaigning just to see who's on the opposition, basically, who is part of the resistance,
[1:56:42.540 --> 1:56:46.540]  and now they're punning and had basically to put us down. Well, that's what they say. Peter Thiel,
[1:56:46.540 --> 1:56:53.740]  the Bilderberg, has bragged that he supported Paul just to map with computers who everybody is
[1:56:53.740 --> 1:57:00.380]  to then understand how to target them politically. And I, yeah, yeah, this, oh my God, if this was
[1:57:00.380 --> 1:57:05.260]  some 20-year mole operation, that has to be looked at now. That's what I mean. That's why I'm so sick
[1:57:05.260 --> 1:57:10.700]  about this. We have to open up an entire research operation now. Yeah, we have to get to the bottom
[1:57:10.700 --> 1:57:15.340]  of this. It's kind of a ridiculous to see that we have supported this man for so long. And just
[1:57:15.340 --> 1:57:19.580]  like that, he turns around and says, don't worry about it. Let's be respectful. I will not be respectful
[1:57:19.580 --> 1:57:23.820]  about this matter. It's my life. It's my baby's life, and it's your life. Let's take care. So he can
[1:57:23.820 --> 1:57:30.620]  go to hell as far as I know. Well, thank you for those words, you know, for saying he won't back
[1:57:30.620 --> 1:57:36.460]  down. But I don't think Ron Paul needs to go to hell. I mean, Ron Paul hasn't done all this yet,
[1:57:36.460 --> 1:57:42.620]  but he's supporting Rand. I understand their delusion. I know Rand, he seems like a nice guy.
[1:57:42.620 --> 1:57:47.900]  I think Rand has lost touch with reality, like his former campaign head said. Maybe he's got
[1:57:47.900 --> 1:57:53.660]  Stockholm syndrome, you know? Well, I mean, what did you think as you've seen all this unfold,
[1:57:53.660 --> 1:57:57.420]  and now there's surrogates are in the news saying, we're stupid and need to grow up.
[1:57:57.420 --> 1:58:02.060]  Mm hmm. That's pretty much how it feels like. Like, yeah, it pretty much feels like we're
[1:58:02.060 --> 1:58:06.380]  stupid right now because we put our hands in this guy's. And that's what we put our faith in
[1:58:06.380 --> 1:58:09.500]  this guy's hands. And this is what happens. Yeah, I feel pretty much fucking stupid.
[1:58:13.340 --> 1:58:19.820]  All right, thank you for the call. We're going to be right back after this quick break.
[1:58:19.820 --> 1:58:27.820]  Right. Another hour is coming up straight ahead. And I've covered some news in the first hour,

[2:00:30.940 --> 2:00:43.500]  That's an accessory to murder. Did you just get that straight? Okay. Boy, here we are another hour. It's it's it's I've got totally insane news that I've got to cover.
[2:00:44.620 --> 2:00:52.780]  Coming up in the next segment, but let's go to some more calls here right now. Let's talk to Dolores in Tennessee. You're on the ear, Dolores.
[2:00:52.780 --> 2:01:18.780]  Hey, um, it's Doris, but I'm sorry, Doris, Doris, Doris. That's okay. If people have not learned by now that we're seeing the same people over and over Eric Holder, Bill Maher, um, you know, when you think about Ruby Ridge, Randy Weaver, Oklahoma City bombing,
[2:01:18.780 --> 2:01:34.780]  um, all the things that the federal government has done to this country and they can't see by now. I don't know if they're ever going to see like the 70 some year old man doesn't he know you come back and look at what's happened to know what's going to happen later.
[2:01:34.780 --> 2:01:52.780]  Well, I mean, Doris, it's not even the federal government. It is a total foreign criminal group breaking the law in front of everyone flat, just flagrantly in our face. We're listening to everything you do without Lawrence. And yeah, we yeah, we have built reeducation centers.
[2:01:52.780 --> 2:02:14.780]  I've been corrected. But I'm brainwashed to to a certain point, you know, when we begin to say no, no, no, no, I'm brainwashed to I say, I say our military, our military, not our military, it's the globalist military. I say federal, I say federal government, it's not the occupied federal government.
[2:02:14.780 --> 2:02:26.780]  We've got to really realize people always say I exaggerate. It's almost always 10 times worse than what I'm saying. I mean, I mean, reality is so wild. And just how much they've gotten away with.
[2:02:26.780 --> 2:02:40.780]  Well, go back and look. Yeah, go back and look at Randy Weaver. He's still alive today. He's 64 years old. They killed his, his wife, his son, his dog. They have standoff at Ruby Bridge.
[2:02:40.780 --> 2:02:50.780]  They hate the American people a hundred times worse than the Iraqis. And that's what's so sad about good old boys or kill all the Iraqors.
[2:02:50.780 --> 2:03:08.780]  And then Waco happened. And then the Oklahoma City bombing happened. All of it happened. And, and, you know, Randy Weaver sued the government and won his case, $3,360,000. And he won against the federal government. Nobody ever reported that.
[2:03:08.780 --> 2:03:15.780]  But they set him up to do the salt off shotguns when he would not be a straw man for them.
[2:03:15.780 --> 2:03:24.780]  No, they told him, they said, you're going to, because you're a former green beret, you're going to go infiltrate the clan. And he said, I'm not going to do that. The Aryan nations. And so they set him up.
[2:03:24.780 --> 2:03:36.780]  And then he was on the, and then he was on the Bill Maher show. You see Bill Maher over and over throughout all this history. And then even the bounty hunter that was with the Casey Anthony trial.
[2:03:36.780 --> 2:03:47.780]  I mean, you know, we're in the same black catty war back. I mean, it's ridiculous. What they have done to this wonderful United States of America.
[2:03:47.780 --> 2:03:55.780]  I hear you, ma'am. I cannot believe it. I hear you. Thank you. Thank you. I mean, what's happened is people began watching television in the fifties.
[2:03:55.780 --> 2:04:02.780]  They stopped talking to their neighbors and they began just drooling. And our whole world is programmed by whatever the system puts out.
[2:04:02.780 --> 2:04:11.780]  Now they brought the internet out track and trace everybody, but it's backfired on them. We're using it. So they want to curtail that. I mean, it's just absolute insanity.
[2:04:11.780 --> 2:04:25.780]  Absolute total tongue dragging the ground insanity. There's a method to the madness that they're an abuse of the population and scientific, but the directive, the reason they do the abuse is crazy.
[2:04:25.780 --> 2:04:35.780]  So they've scientifically set up a system to abuse us and enslave us and destroy all that's good and lift up all that's evil and invent new wickedness as the Bible says they do.
[2:04:35.780 --> 2:04:44.780]  But the driving force behind it is madness. So it's a scientific madness and heaven help us.
[2:04:44.780 --> 2:04:58.780]  Okay, boy, I'm going to do the news blitz of news blitzes after this quick break and then I will continue onward and upward with your phone calls. Ray, Chase, Chris, David and many others, 800-25 at 99-331.

[2:08:14.780 --> 2:08:33.780]  Here we are kicking off another hour of global transmission against tyranny. I am Alex Jones, your host, the tip of the spear when it comes to the fight for no compromise, true liberty and the exposure of the global technocratic slave state calling itself the New World Order.
[2:08:33.780 --> 2:08:44.780]  Really just a bunch of private mega banks that are anti free market want global monopolies where they exempt themselves from all the laws that they get our puppet states to pass.
[2:08:44.780 --> 2:08:53.780]  We are here to unlock the minds of the people and doing a pretty darn good job, especially thanks to all your help out there spreading the word about the show.
[2:08:53.780 --> 2:09:05.780]  Whether you listen on a local AM and FM station, Global Shortwave, the internet at infowars.com, whether you watch us at prisonplanet.tv or XM166, thank you so much for joining us.
[2:09:05.780 --> 2:09:12.780]  Okay, let me get back into more of the news. I've mentioned some of this, but let me just get into this right now.
[2:09:12.780 --> 2:09:23.780]  There's a story out of Slate, US cities embrace software to automatically detect suspicious behavior. These are systems where if you start talking to people on the street, they call the police on you.
[2:09:23.780 --> 2:09:31.780]  If it looks like you're hanging things up, they call police on you. And you know, don't we need computers like this watching the crooks and government.
[2:09:31.780 --> 2:09:39.780]  Oh no, everything government does is national security. And if somebody whistleblows on corruption, they get arrested.
[2:09:39.780 --> 2:09:47.780]  So again, we need people watching the suspicious activities of the federal government.
[2:09:47.780 --> 2:09:55.780]  Now here's another one after Google spy cars and planes company unleashes backpack cameras as latest device and bid to map entire world.
[2:09:55.780 --> 2:10:04.780]  Google is a globalist NSA front so they can make private money off of ripping you off. Google don't be evil was their cover.
[2:10:04.780 --> 2:10:11.780]  Really evil people and groups don't come out and dress up like Darth Vader. They come with a little ice cream cone like Warren Buffett and every photo.
[2:10:11.780 --> 2:10:18.780]  I'm an old man, I got an ice cream cone. I'm the biggest recipient of taxpayer money. That's why I want to raise taxes on rich people.
[2:10:18.780 --> 2:10:29.780]  You know, those make an 125,000 a year. And folks that think that sounds rich go, yeah, yeah, he's nice. He got an ice cream cone. Look, mommy.
[2:10:29.780 --> 2:10:43.780]  Again, it's all camouflage. And so now they're announcing drones everywhere because the globalists know that you see it if it's corporate as less threatening.
[2:10:43.780 --> 2:10:49.780]  Oh, like corporate mercenaries coming after you. Here's another one health panel talks about wider food ban.
[2:10:49.780 --> 2:10:59.780]  Fox News reports out of New York City, fresh off of banning soft drinks above 16 ounces. You can have all you want of aspartame.
[2:10:59.780 --> 2:11:12.780]  It's the sugar ones. If you want the deadly wood alcohol formaldehyde breaks down at 87 degrees, your body's way above that stuff that gives you macular degeneration, all sorts of cancer, brain damaged, addictive.
[2:11:12.780 --> 2:11:22.780]  That's fine. You want some GMO? What's the GMO corn that kills bugs if they eat it? It's got so much naturally growing pesticide in it. It's a pharmacological crop.
[2:11:22.780 --> 2:11:32.780]  That's fine. But you want popcorn? Going to ban that and going to ban the beef ice cream. It's all going to be tracked.
[2:11:32.780 --> 2:11:38.780]  They say milk's bad. So there you go. First they banned the healthy milk and now the other stuff they're going to try to restrict it.
[2:11:38.780 --> 2:11:54.780]  So milk products because the government says what you eat and when you get sick from their soft kill weapons, they'll take even more rights away from you and lie to you and say it's the law to take vaccines.
[2:11:54.780 --> 2:12:09.780]  Oh, remember in New York City and the feds came out and said that the air was safe to breathe when their own internal reports said it was full of asbestos, atomized glass, mercury and now massive deaths from cancer.
[2:12:09.780 --> 2:12:17.780]  Famous people stayed in the area, you know, died from it. You've seen those cases in the news. Almost all the dogs within two years died.
[2:12:17.780 --> 2:12:31.780]  Even five-year-old German shepherds, nasal cancer, lung cancer. And still, there's reports out where they're trying to get the cancers covered for the firefighters and police and other people.
[2:12:31.780 --> 2:12:41.780]  Because regardless of what really happened on 9-11, the folks that responded were heroes. But the New York Post said your ambulance chasers if you want money.
[2:12:41.780 --> 2:12:48.780]  So there you go. It's a conspiracy theory that that was bad for you because government never lies.
[2:12:48.780 --> 2:12:57.780]  Of course, all they do is lie, continuing here with some of the other news. Here's an article out of London Independent.
[2:12:57.780 --> 2:13:06.780]  So which of these does harm male fertility? And they say no, it's not a cigarette study show because they have systems where they pump smoke in on rats.
[2:13:06.780 --> 2:13:12.780]  It's not alcohol like they said. It's not even fattening food. It must be shorts that are too tight.
[2:13:12.780 --> 2:13:18.780]  And it is true that you don't want to get, if you have low sperm count and can't get your wife pregnant, you don't want, because I've read about it.
[2:13:18.780 --> 2:13:27.780]  I don't have that problem, that you don't want to get in hot water above 100 degrees when you take a bath or shower or hot tub.
[2:13:27.780 --> 2:13:32.780]  And you don't want to wear underwear. You want to boost testosterone levels you don't wear underwear.
[2:13:32.780 --> 2:13:36.780]  Because that's why your testicles are on the outside of your body. This is just medical news, folks.
[2:13:36.780 --> 2:13:47.780]  They're on the outside of your body because you, the sperm need to be in 96 degrees or lower and testosterone needs to be developed in the testes at 96 degrees or lower.
[2:13:47.780 --> 2:13:55.780]  That's why they're on the outside of mammals. Outside, not inside. There's a reason for that. There's a reason for that.
[2:13:55.780 --> 2:14:08.780]  And so that's basically the breakdown on that front. But they say sperm counts have dropped 97% or, excuse me, 87% because you're not wearing the right underwear.
[2:14:08.780 --> 2:14:23.780]  So there you have it. That's only part of it, ladies and gentlemen. It's the estrogen mimickers, the bisphenolase and others. That's what the real studies show.
[2:14:23.780 --> 2:14:32.780]  Okay, let's continue here. Panel to post menopausal women. Don't take vitamin D and calcium. I thought you were supposed to.
[2:14:32.780 --> 2:14:42.780]  And they just, they just count the government panels and tell us what to eat. How about Mr. Federal Government caught murdering thousands of troops in secret tests over 50 years?
[2:14:42.780 --> 2:14:49.780]  How about you all get arrested instead of telling us what to do? That sounds a lot better. You're caught shipping guns into Mexico, blowing up Oklahoma City.
[2:14:49.780 --> 2:14:55.780]  How about you go to prison? You're murdering, drug dealing, child trafficking, scum. How about we just call you out for what you are?
[2:14:55.780 --> 2:15:01.780]  Not the authorities, a gang of sinister out of control trash.
[2:15:01.780 --> 2:15:05.780]  You're like, oh, this show's really radical. No, it's not.
[2:15:05.780 --> 2:15:19.780]  Reality's radical. You studied history what out of control systems do when people start becoming thumb suckers.
[2:15:19.780 --> 2:15:26.780]  There's another article from AmericanDream up at infowars.com. The elite are attempting to convince us that killing off our sick grandparents, it's cool and trendy.
[2:15:26.780 --> 2:15:35.780]  And there's just all these articles coming out about how cool it is and how fun it is. Oh my God, my parents are scum. They're old and ugly and stupid.
[2:15:35.780 --> 2:15:45.780]  And I killed them. I cut off any medical treatment. It's so fun. We're going to hire 10 teachers, kill granny.
[2:15:45.780 --> 2:15:51.780]  I mean, it's just like kill kids up to age three. They're not humans. You've been hearing that in the news.
[2:15:51.780 --> 2:15:56.780]  Yeah, kids are bad with a carbon footprint. You watch all the TV shows. They put down kids. They put down men.
[2:15:56.780 --> 2:16:05.780]  They show women in charge everywhere so they can destroy women's. Women can stomp around hotly and boss everyone around and henpeck each other.
[2:16:05.780 --> 2:16:10.780]  Man, it's just that just everything the Bible talked about. Women over you and your children over you.
[2:16:10.780 --> 2:16:18.780]  Society just plunging into hell itself. And we're just starting to roller coaster ride down. You ain't seen nothing yet.
[2:16:18.780 --> 2:16:25.780]  We got to come out of the next break with you ain't seen nothing yet. No, no, you ain't seen nothing yet. I know it's in there.
[2:16:25.780 --> 2:16:31.780]  Let's continue with the news. I want to cover this on the nightly news tonight so I can properly show you the graphics.
[2:16:31.780 --> 2:16:38.780]  But zombies, deniers, sociopaths, schemers and protectors, the five dominant personalities you'll encounter in the world gone mad.
[2:16:38.780 --> 2:16:43.780]  Mike Adams has got the protectors of the sheep dogs, not the wolves, not the sheep, as the good guys.
[2:16:43.780 --> 2:16:54.780]  But I talked about the fake nanny state protectors. They always have a counterfeit of anything like that.
[2:16:54.780 --> 2:17:06.780]  And again, we will be covering that on the nightly news in detail this evening. We'll look at the zombies, the deniers, the sociopaths and the schemers.
[2:17:06.780 --> 2:17:18.780]  Well, there's also the torture masters, having people at their will, having people totally captured and panicking, the vampires.
[2:17:18.780 --> 2:17:28.780]  So I will add the vampires. They're at the top of the, in fact, maybe Marcus, we're skeleton crews, a few folks are on vacation right now, well-deserved.
[2:17:28.780 --> 2:17:41.780]  Maybe a pyramid with the different types in it. The protectors that actually hold the whole system up, then the fake nanny state with the idea that only the nanny state could do the protecting.
[2:17:41.780 --> 2:17:53.780]  And then above that, you've got the zombies, then you've got the deniers, then you've got the sociopaths, then you've got the schemers, then you've got the master, idiot, savant vampire brain bugs.
[2:17:53.780 --> 2:18:01.780]  And then above that, you've got the psychic vampire supreme overlord level, which is just the essence of death and destruction.
[2:18:01.780 --> 2:18:08.780]  I mean, that would be the actual effect. Let me just get the pyramid ready so I can give it to them. You have a document cam shot, people watching on prisonplanet.tv.
[2:18:08.780 --> 2:18:17.780]  Let me see, here's the pyramid. And we've just been taught to be spectators. That's another group. They've gotten good people to be spectators.
[2:18:17.780 --> 2:18:25.780]  So that's how they've gotten us, the real protectors, out of the game by watching the television mind control device.
[2:18:25.780 --> 2:18:38.780]  So the normal protectors with normal wiring and a good upbringing that's being phased out, they're busy mesmerizing a dream state, or if they wake up, they're called conspiracy theorist.
[2:18:38.780 --> 2:18:51.780]  Okay. But then you've got the, well, you've got the zombies, and you've got the quasi zombie spectator. So I guess he does have it right.
[2:18:51.780 --> 2:19:01.780]  Zombie spectators will be the term. You've got the deniers that, well, they think it's trendy to go along with whatever the system says, because they're like pretending they're winning by doing that.
[2:19:01.780 --> 2:19:12.780]  Then you've got the sociopaths, then you've got schemers, then you've got the technocrat vampires, and then you've got the supreme overlord vampires.
[2:19:12.780 --> 2:19:19.780]  Who really hate the vampires beneath them, and the schemers are usually physically destroying them on a routine basis.
[2:19:19.780 --> 2:19:27.780]  They got to keep their numbers down, or they'll scheme together and unseat the master vampires. One of the worst jobs they have is to be a technocrat vampire.
[2:19:27.780 --> 2:19:32.780]  I mean, it didn't even really mean, he's kind of a mercenary vampire. You might not even enjoy what you're doing.
[2:19:32.780 --> 2:19:42.780]  A lot of them do, but they mainly do it because they want to feel good about themselves. The famers, the mercenary fame people, they'll do it.
[2:19:42.780 --> 2:19:46.780]  There's a lot of reasons they can get them to sell out. You know what? We're going to come back with more calls.
[2:19:46.780 --> 2:19:52.780]  Then I'm going to get into Israel, rounds up Africans who threaten the character of the Jewish state Reuters reports.
[2:19:52.780 --> 2:19:57.780]  Man, imagine if they rounded up the black people here. That'd be called racist, but not when Israel does it.
[2:19:57.780 --> 2:20:25.780]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.

[2:23:03.780 --> 2:23:08.780]  And one of the biggest is that men are losing libido or sexual desire, especially if you're a man over 40.
[2:23:08.780 --> 2:23:11.780]  The problem could be declining testosterone levels.
[2:23:11.780 --> 2:23:15.780]  Remember, it's testosterone that makes a man a man in every way.

[2:23:59.780 --> 2:24:17.780]  You think 30,000 armed drones illegally operating against the American people Pentagon run is bad?
[2:24:17.780 --> 2:24:25.780]  You think the UN and NATO saying that they openly run our military and Congress should sit down and shut up and Congress did?
[2:24:25.780 --> 2:24:31.780]  You ain't seen nothing yet. You think they're going to ban soft drinks with sugar in them? You ain't seen nothing yet.
[2:24:31.780 --> 2:24:40.780]  They're going to ban popcorn and over certain amounts of beef, chicken, meat. They've said they're going to ban it. It's carbon tax.
[2:24:40.780 --> 2:24:46.780]  It's all here. It's all happening. They're going to dig through your trash can. It's already begun in Miami and other areas.
[2:24:46.780 --> 2:24:55.780]  You ain't seen nothing yet. This is all planned. UN, global government, set up by you, Genesis. They set up UNESCO.
[2:24:55.780 --> 2:25:04.780]  They've said their plan. You notice yesterday I played part of that Ray Kurzweil clip from the big UN summit in Moscow.
[2:25:04.780 --> 2:25:11.780]  And coming up later in the news segment, after I take some more calls, I'm going to play a clip from it.
[2:25:11.780 --> 2:25:18.780]  The part we didn't get to, we notice they say we will merge with machines and live forever and fly through space.
[2:25:18.780 --> 2:25:32.780]  That's a UN transhumanist quote by Ray Kurzweil that I put with the quote in in-game blueprint for global enslavement in 2007, five years ago.
[2:25:32.780 --> 2:25:41.780]  And I've had countless newspapers come out and make fun of me for that and go, Alex says they're going to merge with machines, live forever and fly around in spaceships.
[2:25:41.780 --> 2:25:48.780]  I was giving the quote by the crazy elite that say after they kill us, they're going to do all this. I don't know if that's going to happen or not,
[2:25:48.780 --> 2:25:52.780]  but everything they said they do so far in the plan, they've been following.
[2:25:52.780 --> 2:26:00.780]  So it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that they're going to keep doing all. I mean, Ted Turner, all of them are like, yeah, we're going to kill 90% of you.
[2:26:00.780 --> 2:26:06.780]  Yeah, we're going to build level four bio weapons labs all around you.
[2:26:06.780 --> 2:26:10.780]  Yeah, we're going to do that.
[2:26:10.780 --> 2:26:16.780]  We're going to build them in level two facilities where we can get out. Okay, we're just supposed to sit here and go, oh, everything's fine.
[2:26:16.780 --> 2:26:20.780]  Hey, Mitt Romney, man, he's going to fix it. Yeah. Oh, yeah.
[2:26:20.780 --> 2:26:24.780]  Button paid for by the same people. It's all just window dressing Obama Romney.
[2:26:24.780 --> 2:26:30.780]  They got a puppet dancing in front of me. Look at the puppet. Look at the puppet. I'm like, look at the guy pulling the puppets. The same guy.
[2:26:30.780 --> 2:26:35.780]  Hey, look, here's Mitt Romney. Here's Barack Obama.
[2:26:35.780 --> 2:26:42.780]  Ron Paul four years ago, he said, hey, I'm not going to support McCain. I can't. He's basically the same as Obama.
[2:26:42.780 --> 2:26:45.780]  Everybody's like, wow, he really understands it.
[2:26:45.780 --> 2:26:50.780]  Four years later. Hey, we're doing what we got to do. We may not even have a counter conference.
[2:26:50.780 --> 2:26:55.780]  The Republicans might get mad or bringing in all these mainline Republican strategist.
[2:26:55.780 --> 2:26:58.780]  Well, hey, we don't like that. Well, we don't need you anymore.
[2:26:58.780 --> 2:27:01.780]  People that brought us to this, you libertarian constitutionalist.
[2:27:01.780 --> 2:27:07.780]  We're merging with the Republican Party. That's basically the message. We want the Republican Party to like us. That's what they've all said.
[2:27:07.780 --> 2:27:14.780]  Okay, I don't hate you. I don't dislike you. I understand your thought process. It's incredibly flawed.
[2:27:14.780 --> 2:27:21.780]  I mean, I liked the Ron Paul four years ago, not this new one. And please don't say, oh, there's an, you know, Ron Paul didn't do this.
[2:27:21.780 --> 2:27:25.780]  Yeah, he did. He coordinated this with Rand Paul.
[2:27:25.780 --> 2:27:32.780]  Last week, the announcement that, okay, our campaign is over. We're not going to have the delegates we needed as if that wasn't the case for months.
[2:27:32.780 --> 2:27:37.780]  Right as Rand comes out with his announcements, it's deals being made behind the scenes.
[2:27:37.780 --> 2:27:44.780]  And we're not being told about those deals. Ray and Cal, because we, because we're the stupid, unwashed Ron Paul supporters.
[2:27:44.780 --> 2:27:47.780]  Let's talk to Ray in California. Go ahead.
[2:27:47.780 --> 2:27:48.780]  Alex.
[2:27:48.780 --> 2:27:49.780]  Yes.
[2:27:49.780 --> 2:27:52.780]  Alex, did you read the New York Times this morning?
[2:27:52.780 --> 2:27:53.780]  No.
[2:27:53.780 --> 2:27:57.780]  The New York Times today has Syria on the front page.
[2:27:57.780 --> 2:28:05.780]  Oh, yeah. And I know they're all saying they're going to attack it. Yeah, but, but, but we're fair mongers to say that they're openly calling for aerial bombardments and ground invasions.
[2:28:05.780 --> 2:28:12.780]  I see this Pentagon thing on my website, but in the comments saying we're making it up that anything's about to happen in Syria. Yes.
[2:28:12.780 --> 2:28:16.780]  You know, the Syria is a trigger for a nuclear holocaust.
[2:28:16.780 --> 2:28:25.780]  Well, the Russians do say that they're, they're, they're moving nukes into those areas and may, you know, so what the bankers have underground bunkers, everything's fine.
[2:28:25.780 --> 2:28:31.780]  They're also doing source techniques in Russia and they're trying to get the backdoor reinitiated in China through payout.
[2:28:31.780 --> 2:28:39.780]  Exactly. And then they say you're not patriotic if you don't support Soros. Hey, I don't like the Russian government, the stuff they do, but they're not over here running my life.
[2:28:39.780 --> 2:28:45.780]  They're not the ones launching drones against me. They're not the ones brain damaging our kids with forced vaccines and lying about it.
[2:28:45.780 --> 2:28:55.780]  You know, I'm sick of the system. Oh, the Muslims will get you. Give your rights up and they run the Muslim al-Qaeda or the Russians will get you while they pay to ship our factories to China.
[2:28:55.780 --> 2:29:02.780]  Yeah. The reason why the runner reestablished the backdoor is because they want to have a limited nuclear holocaust that they can pull it off.
[2:29:02.780 --> 2:29:08.780]  Yeah. More and more, I think that Joel Scousen is right about this, but he thinks it comes in five to 10 years.
[2:29:08.780 --> 2:29:15.780]  I mean, the elite are digging in in bunkers like it's going to happen tomorrow, telling us we're kooks and we have some storable foods.
[2:29:15.780 --> 2:29:19.780]  Don't have storable foods, but we're building giant billion dollar bunkers.
[2:29:19.780 --> 2:29:26.780]  We're building bio weapon labs all around your major cities that if any of it gets that will kill 90% of you.
[2:29:26.780 --> 2:29:31.780]  But everything's fine. Don't be a conspiracy theorist. That means don't question. I'm sorry. Go ahead, conspiracy theorist.
[2:29:31.780 --> 2:29:37.780]  What they want to do here is they want to have a bio holocaust before the nuclear holocaust.
[2:29:37.780 --> 2:29:42.780]  And they want to have the nuclear holocaust by the end of this year or the beginning of next year.
[2:29:42.780 --> 2:29:49.780]  Alright, I hope you're wrong, but there's no telling what they'll do. They financed Hitler, Mao and everybody else.
[2:29:49.780 --> 2:30:15.780]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:20.780 --> 2:30:24.780]  Number three. In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[2:30:24.780 --> 2:30:28.780]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[2:30:28.780 --> 2:30:31.780]  Number four. Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[2:30:31.780 --> 2:30:35.780]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[2:30:35.780 --> 2:30:40.780]  Number five. A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[2:30:40.780 --> 2:30:45.780]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[2:30:45.780 --> 2:30:51.780]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[2:30:51.780 --> 2:30:59.780]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[2:31:01.780 --> 2:31:05.780]  Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones. I don't want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[2:31:05.780 --> 2:31:14.780]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[2:31:14.780 --> 2:31:19.780]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[2:31:19.780 --> 2:31:25.780]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions
[2:31:25.780 --> 2:31:30.780]  and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream
[2:31:30.780 --> 2:31:34.780]  with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products.
[2:31:34.780 --> 2:31:40.780]  You can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[2:31:40.780 --> 2:31:45.780]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[2:31:45.780 --> 2:31:53.780]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[2:31:53.780 --> 2:32:11.780]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[2:32:24.780 --> 2:32:30.780]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%. Easy to set up and use. Doesn't require electricity.
[2:32:30.780 --> 2:32:37.780]  Purify water from lake streams, ponds, and wells. This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[2:32:37.780 --> 2:32:41.780]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[2:32:41.780 --> 2:32:45.780]  Propure is the best gravity-fed filter out there. It's what my family uses.
[2:32:45.780 --> 2:32:54.780]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on Propure, but if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.
[2:32:54.780 --> 2:32:59.780]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[2:33:04.780 --> 2:33:11.780]  The decision is being made by the President and the Joint Chiefs in the War Room at the Pentagon.
[2:33:11.780 --> 2:33:18.780]  When they realize there is no possibility of recalling the Wing, there will be only one course of action open.
[2:33:18.780 --> 2:33:20.780]  A total commitment.
[2:33:20.780 --> 2:33:24.780]  Mandry, do you recall what Clemens once said about war?
[2:33:24.780 --> 2:33:27.780]  No, I didn't think I knew of that.
[2:33:27.780 --> 2:33:31.780]  He said war was too important to be left to the Generals.
[2:33:31.780 --> 2:33:36.780]  When he said that 50 years ago, he might have been right.
[2:33:36.780 --> 2:33:41.780]  But today, war is too important to be left to politicians.
[2:33:41.780 --> 2:33:49.780]  They have neither the time, the training, nor the inclination for strategic thought.
[2:33:49.780 --> 2:33:57.780]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[2:33:57.780 --> 2:34:05.780]  The globalists are totally committed. The printer ink is best for you all to sterilize you and your family and give you cancer. Look it up.
[2:34:05.780 --> 2:34:17.780]  All the major GMO crops have back doors built in to create pesticides to give you cancer, reduce your fertility, and mutate you by the third generation to the point of not even being human.
[2:34:17.780 --> 2:34:22.780]  Look it up. We are being hit from every side. Most of us are already walking dead.
[2:34:22.780 --> 2:34:34.780]  Best to understand that. This is toe-to-toe combat with the eugenics, black op command force that's infiltrated every level of society and used brainwashing flicker rates to put the general public into deep trances.
[2:34:34.780 --> 2:34:39.780]  If you're able to understand this transmission, it means that you've broken the trance at some level.
[2:34:39.780 --> 2:34:45.780]  If you're laughing uncontrollably right now, that's a inlaid program to laugh when you hear the truth.
[2:34:45.780 --> 2:34:50.780]  You've been preconditioned by all the different messaging and things, mainly at the subliminal level.
[2:34:50.780 --> 2:34:57.780]  Let me hit some more news, and then we'll get back to your calls. I mentioned this earlier, and I saw this in Reuters this morning.
[2:34:57.780 --> 2:35:01.780]  There's an article at infowars.com going over it with the quotes.
[2:35:01.780 --> 2:35:05.780]  Israel rounds up Africans who threaten the character of the Jewish state.
[2:35:05.780 --> 2:35:10.780]  And what happened is King Solomon did have a bunch of wives from Ethiopia.
[2:35:10.780 --> 2:35:13.780]  And much of Ethiopia says they're Jewish.
[2:35:13.780 --> 2:35:17.780]  It's some of the oldest Christian groups as well down there, and they've been able to immigrate in.
[2:35:17.780 --> 2:35:21.780]  Israel's decided that ain't the way it's working.
[2:35:21.780 --> 2:35:27.780]  And so I've got it here out of Reuters.
[2:35:27.780 --> 2:35:34.780]  Israel government wants to get rid of 60,000 African migrants whose growing numbers are seen by many Israelis as a law and order issue,
[2:35:34.780 --> 2:35:39.780]  even a threat of long-term viability of the Jewish state according to Reuters.
[2:35:39.780 --> 2:35:46.780]  And it goes on, for some in Israel, built by immigrants and refugees, internment and deportation are bad solutions.
[2:35:46.780 --> 2:35:50.780]  Well, my issue is why were they led in as workers to begin with?
[2:35:50.780 --> 2:35:55.780]  And listen, if you're going to have a country, I mean, France isn't French anymore.
[2:35:55.780 --> 2:35:59.780]  England's not. And I'm not bashing the groups that have come there wanting a better life.
[2:35:59.780 --> 2:36:08.780]  But the point is, is that the Israel lobby in this country is always lobbying for open borders, gun control,
[2:36:08.780 --> 2:36:10.780]  trying to manipulate our policies.
[2:36:10.780 --> 2:36:15.780]  So we're a kept nation to keep funding what's happening over there. That's my irritation.
[2:36:15.780 --> 2:36:19.780]  And I mean, you know, saying we're going to ship the black people out.
[2:36:19.780 --> 2:36:24.780]  And I've seen articles like where they say, you know, you'll be arrested if you marry a Jewish woman.
[2:36:24.780 --> 2:36:27.780]  I mean, you can look that up. That's like Jerusalem Post.
[2:36:27.780 --> 2:36:32.780]  My only issue is I don't want to be lectured all day by big Israeli war hawk,
[2:36:32.780 --> 2:36:37.780]  you know, dual citizen people in Congress about how if I don't want Obamacare, I'm a racist.
[2:36:37.780 --> 2:36:39.780]  When I'm not even thinking about race.
[2:36:39.780 --> 2:36:42.780]  And I'm not here henpecking at Israel either.
[2:36:42.780 --> 2:36:46.780]  But I mean, it is a religious racial state. This is kind of stuff goes on.
[2:36:46.780 --> 2:36:49.780]  Most countries in history have been religious or racial.
[2:36:49.780 --> 2:36:55.780]  So my whole point is, is that this is what I shove in the face of the Israel lobby.
[2:36:55.780 --> 2:36:59.780]  It's a diverse lobby, but you know, the really liberal sections of it aren't liberal at all.
[2:36:59.780 --> 2:37:06.780]  You know, that they want everybody in Israel to have M16s taxpayer paid for by me and by you,
[2:37:06.780 --> 2:37:09.780]  but then lobby to get our guns.
[2:37:09.780 --> 2:37:14.780]  In fact, there's the article out of Reuters. Israel said Monday started rounding up African migrants
[2:37:14.780 --> 2:37:20.780]  in the first stage of a controversial emergency plan to in turn and deport thousands deemed to be a threat
[2:37:20.780 --> 2:37:22.780]  to the Jewish character of the state.
[2:37:22.780 --> 2:37:30.780]  I mean, to imagine of the headline, you know, thousands of blacks to be rounded up
[2:37:30.780 --> 2:37:34.780]  because they're a threat to the character of the United States state.
[2:37:34.780 --> 2:37:38.780]  But I guess I need to be politically correct. So I support Israel and what they're doing.
[2:37:38.780 --> 2:37:42.780]  I think it's not racist at all. I'm being sarcastic.
[2:37:42.780 --> 2:37:47.780]  I mean, it's just so over the top folks. It's so over the top.
[2:37:47.780 --> 2:37:51.780]  I'll probably get attacked by the ADL for criticizing it.
[2:37:51.780 --> 2:37:55.780]  The ADL caught breaking into police departments, stealing files on people.
[2:37:55.780 --> 2:37:57.780]  They don't need that now. They got Google.
[2:37:57.780 --> 2:38:01.780]  The ADL running around Southern Barbie Law Center and others.
[2:38:01.780 --> 2:38:06.780]  A bunch of these groups have been caught creating fake white supremacist groups.
[2:38:06.780 --> 2:38:09.780]  Oh, man.
[2:38:09.780 --> 2:38:15.780]  One time I went out to protest a white supremacist rally in downtown Austin and I'd played it on local cable TV
[2:38:15.780 --> 2:38:20.780]  and I was like, these white supremacists all look like Howard Stern with short haircuts.
[2:38:20.780 --> 2:38:21.780]  I mean, it was like totally okay.
[2:38:21.780 --> 2:38:25.780]  And later came out it was fake and they get everybody fighting with each other.
[2:38:25.780 --> 2:38:28.780]  Again, most people in Israel don't like what's happening.
[2:38:28.780 --> 2:38:32.780]  Most the Jews I talked to in the U.S. are against what's happening.
[2:38:32.780 --> 2:38:36.780]  And the media tries to make it either a monolithic. You totally support everything Israel does
[2:38:36.780 --> 2:38:40.780]  and don't question anything, meaning the government of Israel or you're anti-Semitic
[2:38:40.780 --> 2:38:43.780]  or you totally hate Israel or you're bad.
[2:38:43.780 --> 2:38:50.780]  And I find the same crazy vitriol from the pro-Israel camp and the anti-Israel camp.
[2:38:50.780 --> 2:38:58.780]  And this is the type of stuff that really leads to big problems.
[2:38:58.780 --> 2:39:03.780]  And I don't see how Israel can continue on doing things like this.
[2:39:03.780 --> 2:39:06.780]  I mean, there's 60,000 black Africans there.
[2:39:06.780 --> 2:39:11.780]  What Reuters doesn't mention is almost all of them got there because they come from communities
[2:39:11.780 --> 2:39:16.780]  that for thousands of years have said they're Jewish and they're proud of the fact.
[2:39:16.780 --> 2:39:23.780]  And they have features that are more Semitic than African.
[2:39:23.780 --> 2:39:25.780]  I mean, they clearly have some of those features.
[2:39:25.780 --> 2:39:29.780]  They say they have that bloodline. It's been adopted. It's been accepted by Israel.
[2:39:29.780 --> 2:39:33.780]  And now you're going to tell them that they're not Jewish.
[2:39:33.780 --> 2:39:35.780]  I mean, that's what's not really being said here.
[2:39:35.780 --> 2:39:42.780]  They were led into Israel as refugees back in the 60s and 70s and 80s because they are Jewish,
[2:39:42.780 --> 2:39:44.780]  a lot of them, or say they are.
[2:39:44.780 --> 2:39:52.780]  And my whole issue is that it's just amazing.
[2:39:52.780 --> 2:39:55.780]  I mean, that's all I can say.
[2:39:55.780 --> 2:39:59.780]  And to say because of crime, you know, the old thing that blacks are all criminals.
[2:39:59.780 --> 2:40:01.780]  I mean, they even throw that in there.
[2:40:01.780 --> 2:40:06.780]  And it's like, because it's Israel, it's like, well, okay, you know, those blacks, they're criminals.
[2:40:06.780 --> 2:40:11.780]  The New York Times will probably say what I just said, taken out as a quote and say I said it.
[2:40:11.780 --> 2:40:17.780]  When I was quoting what's going on in Israel, just amazing.
[2:40:17.780 --> 2:40:19.780]  Okay, now I've ranted about that too long.
[2:40:19.780 --> 2:40:21.780]  I've got all this other news I want to get to.
[2:40:21.780 --> 2:40:25.780]  I played part of this yesterday, a big UN event in Moscow a few months ago.
[2:40:25.780 --> 2:40:28.780]  Ray Kurzweil running it in Endgame.
[2:40:28.780 --> 2:40:35.780]  And I still need to do a video on this showing what I said in Endgame with the quotes versus what Ray Kurzweil and the UN say.
[2:40:35.780 --> 2:40:39.780]  And the UN was set up by transhumanist, which is the new name for you, Genesis.
[2:40:39.780 --> 2:40:40.780]  They even said that.
[2:40:40.780 --> 2:40:42.780]  They said, well, Hitler made us look bad.
[2:40:42.780 --> 2:40:44.780]  We'll call ourselves transhumanist.
[2:40:44.780 --> 2:40:48.780]  And now if you're into empowering humanity, making the blind see, you think, oh, that's what they are.
[2:40:48.780 --> 2:40:53.780]  No, no, no, no, they say they're going to control evolution, merge with machines, kill the rest of us.
[2:40:53.780 --> 2:40:57.780]  And that's the rest of the story, as Paul Harvey would say.
[2:40:57.780 --> 2:41:03.780]  So I want to do a piece on this soon that's more produced with all the documents showing the rest of the story.
[2:41:03.780 --> 2:41:09.780]  But here's the part I didn't get to yesterday because of time constraints and the articles up there.
[2:41:09.780 --> 2:41:17.780]  UN Back Conference talks about the new man and the end of humanity, as we know it.
[2:41:17.780 --> 2:41:23.780]  And again, all this tech that's being rolled out by him has backdoors to surveil, control, and dehumanize.
[2:41:23.780 --> 2:41:27.780]  And you think people are already watching television and looking at their iPads and not talking to people.
[2:41:27.780 --> 2:41:30.780]  They're now starting to interface and getting addicted.
[2:41:30.780 --> 2:41:33.780]  The wirehead, the plugging into the brain, the matrix is here.
[2:41:33.780 --> 2:41:39.780]  Philip K. Dick wrote about it 35 years ago, the film The Matrix is just based on Pentagon plans.
[2:41:39.780 --> 2:41:47.780]  Again, declassified in 2000, where they actually talk about us all living in pods and powering things with our body heat.
[2:41:47.780 --> 2:41:49.780]  And that movie is just all in your face.
[2:41:49.780 --> 2:41:51.780]  Now, I'm not saying that's going to happen.
[2:41:51.780 --> 2:41:53.780]  This is what they say.
[2:41:53.780 --> 2:41:58.780]  This is a UN conference saying they're going to control reality and you just better get ready to accept it.
[2:41:58.780 --> 2:42:06.780]  And they talk about a new religion, their new religion is the technotronic merger and blasting off into the space as robots.
[2:42:06.780 --> 2:42:10.780]  Okay, we should have a debate about whether we, A, think this is feasible.
[2:42:10.780 --> 2:42:14.780]  B, think it's a good idea.
[2:42:14.780 --> 2:42:18.780]  But the general public's like, this guy's using fancy terms.
[2:42:18.780 --> 2:42:23.780]  We said technotronic, what are you trying to show off for, pal?
[2:42:23.780 --> 2:42:25.780]  A bench press 350.
[2:42:25.780 --> 2:42:29.780]  I'm like, look, I'm not trying to show off to you. I just want to warn you about some stuff going on.
[2:42:29.780 --> 2:42:33.780]  Did you know most people that have autopsies now have nanotech in their brain?
[2:42:33.780 --> 2:42:37.780]  They're spiking it as part of a global program into some of the food.
[2:42:37.780 --> 2:42:39.780]  Just like I think your baby's blood at birth.
[2:42:39.780 --> 2:42:44.780]  Oh, yeah, right. I'm the guy who's going to get me. I'm the tenfold hat.
[2:42:44.780 --> 2:42:48.780]  I'm like, listen, this is very important. You need to, oh, here it is, my boy.
[2:42:48.780 --> 2:42:54.780]  I'm like, if you went and got your brainwaves checked, I would imagine you're in a suspended disbelief subconscious program right now.
[2:42:54.780 --> 2:42:58.780]  And that you're at the edge of dreaming. That's why you're laughing at me right now.
[2:42:58.780 --> 2:43:00.780]  Who's right, crazy man?
[2:43:00.780 --> 2:43:03.780]  Because they've been put into a near sleep state.
[2:43:03.780 --> 2:43:06.780]  Look at the brainwave reports. This is mainstream news.
[2:43:06.780 --> 2:43:09.780]  And they just report it like it's no big deal.
[2:43:09.780 --> 2:43:14.780]  And then they're down there in that subconscious where the subconscious knows this is real and is scared.
[2:43:14.780 --> 2:43:17.780]  It's hundreds of times more powerful than the conscious mind.
[2:43:17.780 --> 2:43:19.780]  Some people, it's thousands of times more powerful.
[2:43:19.780 --> 2:43:22.780]  It knows everything's going on. It's scared to death.
[2:43:22.780 --> 2:43:24.780]  And you come to them and say, hey, this is happening.
[2:43:24.780 --> 2:43:30.780]  And then the pre-programmed outside defense mechanism hits, eyes glaze over.
[2:43:30.780 --> 2:43:32.780]  Boom. Can't hear you.
[2:43:32.780 --> 2:43:36.780]  I mean, they got GMO. They got nanotech in their brain already.
[2:43:36.780 --> 2:43:42.780]  Oh, yeah. I mean, we are so far down the rat hole and we haven't even begun the descent.
[2:43:42.780 --> 2:43:45.780]  And I tell you what, it's amazing.
[2:43:45.780 --> 2:43:48.780]  Let's go ahead and talk to, no, let's go ahead and go to that video.
[2:43:48.780 --> 2:43:49.780]  Then we'll go back to your calls.
[2:43:49.780 --> 2:43:54.780]  Here is the forecast of the U.N. from the big U.N. Moscow conference. Here it is.
[2:44:19.780 --> 2:44:25.780]  The future development intensifies. New transhumanist movements and parties emerge.
[2:44:25.780 --> 2:44:30.780]  Russia 2045 transforms into world 2045.
[2:44:30.780 --> 2:44:36.780]  Simultaneously, the 2045.com international social network for open innovation is expanding.
[2:44:36.780 --> 2:44:39.780]  Here, anyone interested may propose a project.
[2:44:39.780 --> 2:44:43.780]  Take part in working on it or fund it or both.
[2:44:43.780 --> 2:44:49.780]  In the network, there are scientists, scholars, researchers, financiers and managers.
[2:44:49.780 --> 2:44:52.780]  2013 to 2014.
[2:44:52.780 --> 2:44:58.780]  New centers working on cybernetic technologies for the development of radical life extension rise.
[2:44:58.780 --> 2:45:01.780]  The race for immortality starts.
[2:45:01.780 --> 2:45:04.780]  2015 to 2020.
[2:45:04.780 --> 2:45:06.780]  The avatar is created.
[2:45:06.780 --> 2:45:11.780]  A robotic human copy controlled by thought via brain-computer interface.
[2:45:11.780 --> 2:45:13.780]  It becomes as popular as a car.
[2:45:13.780 --> 2:45:19.780]  In Russia and in the world appear, in testing mode, several breakthrough projects.
[2:45:19.780 --> 2:45:22.780]  Android robots to replace people in manufacturing tasks.
[2:45:22.780 --> 2:45:26.780]  Android robot servants for every home.
[2:45:26.780 --> 2:45:30.780]  Thought-controlled avatars to provide telepresence in any place in the world
[2:45:30.780 --> 2:45:33.780]  and abolish the need for business trips.
[2:45:33.780 --> 2:45:35.780]  Flying cars.
[2:45:35.780 --> 2:45:42.780]  Thought-driven mobile communications built into the body or sprayed onto the skin.
[2:45:42.780 --> 2:45:45.780]  2020 to 2025.
[2:45:45.780 --> 2:45:48.780]  An autonomous system providing life support for the brain
[2:45:48.780 --> 2:45:52.780]  and allowing it interaction with the environment is created.
[2:45:52.780 --> 2:45:55.780]  The brain is transplanted into an avatar beam.
[2:45:55.780 --> 2:45:59.780]  With avatar beam, man receives new, expanded life.
[2:45:59.780 --> 2:46:05.780]  2025. The new generation of avatars provides complete transmission of sensations
[2:46:05.780 --> 2:46:09.780]  from all five sensory robot organs to the operator.
[2:46:09.780 --> 2:46:13.780]  2030 to 2035.
[2:46:13.780 --> 2:46:14.780]  Rebrain.
[2:46:14.780 --> 2:46:18.780]  The colossal project of brain reverse engineering is implemented.
[2:46:18.780 --> 2:46:22.780]  World science comes very close to understanding the principles of consciousness.
[2:46:22.780 --> 2:46:24.780]  2035.
[2:46:24.780 --> 2:46:29.780]  The first successful attempt to transfer one's personality to an alternative carrier.
[2:46:29.780 --> 2:46:33.780]  The epoch of cybernetic immortality begins.
[2:46:35.780 --> 2:46:38.780]  2040 to 2050.
[2:46:38.780 --> 2:46:41.780]  Bodies made of nanorobots that can take any shape.
[2:46:41.780 --> 2:46:44.780]  Arise alongside hologram bodies.
[2:46:44.780 --> 2:46:47.780]  2045 to 2050.
[2:46:47.780 --> 2:46:50.780]  Drastic changes in social structure.
[2:46:50.780 --> 2:46:53.780]  And in scientific and technological development.
[2:46:53.780 --> 2:46:57.780]  All the prerequisites for space expansion are established.
[2:46:57.780 --> 2:47:01.780]  For the man of the future, war and violence are unacceptable.
[2:47:01.780 --> 2:47:06.780]  The main priority of his development is spiritual self-improvement.
[2:47:06.780 --> 2:47:09.780]  A new era dawns.
[2:47:09.780 --> 2:47:13.780]  The era of neo-humanity.
[2:47:13.780 --> 2:47:19.780]  All right. Now, that's put out by the UN.
[2:47:19.780 --> 2:47:25.780]  And it's global standardization saying the UN must decide the course of the technological development.
[2:47:25.780 --> 2:47:28.780]  Remember, the real technology is 30 years advanced.
[2:47:28.780 --> 2:47:31.780]  They're just rolling a lot of this out now at you.
[2:47:31.780 --> 2:47:35.780]  The neo-human, there won't be, if you get into deeper documents,
[2:47:35.780 --> 2:47:38.780]  but about 1% of the original humans will be allowed to live.
[2:47:38.780 --> 2:47:43.780]  And this is their plan when you get up to 2060 or so.
[2:47:43.780 --> 2:47:47.780]  But they don't tell people at Thursday, say, we're only going to kill 80%.
[2:47:47.780 --> 2:47:49.780]  We're only going to kill 90%.
[2:47:49.780 --> 2:47:51.780]  And then we're only, and then higher level documents in the league.
[2:47:51.780 --> 2:47:53.780]  Well, we're going to keep about 2%.
[2:47:53.780 --> 2:47:59.780]  Some documents say we may decide to kill ourselves or blast off the earth and blow it up for fun.
[2:47:59.780 --> 2:48:01.780]  This is what the top billionaires say.
[2:48:01.780 --> 2:48:04.780]  We quote them in in-game blueprint for global enslavement.
[2:48:04.780 --> 2:48:05.780]  You're like, this is madness.
[2:48:05.780 --> 2:48:07.780]  Well, these are the folks in charge.
[2:48:07.780 --> 2:48:12.780]  Not me saying this, New York Times, and others when you attack me and say,
[2:48:12.780 --> 2:48:16.780]  Jones says they're going to live forever and blast off at spaceships.
[2:48:16.780 --> 2:48:18.780]  Notice they talk about religious.
[2:48:18.780 --> 2:48:21.780]  This will empower us religiously.
[2:48:21.780 --> 2:48:24.780]  And now they're going to be God making the new creatures.
[2:48:24.780 --> 2:48:28.780]  See, there's no room for you when you get into their deeper literature.
[2:48:28.780 --> 2:48:30.780]  Notice the whole avatar thing.
[2:48:30.780 --> 2:48:33.780]  I've already talked to, by the way, I wanted to get Tommy back on.
[2:48:33.780 --> 2:48:34.780]  I forgot to get him on.
[2:48:34.780 --> 2:48:35.780]  Let's get him on next week.
[2:48:35.780 --> 2:48:40.780]  I've talked to people that have gotten tours years ago when nobody had of the new hologram movies.
[2:48:40.780 --> 2:48:42.780]  They're just not ready to roll it out yet.
[2:48:42.780 --> 2:48:44.780]  They're just phasing it in right now.
[2:48:44.780 --> 2:48:48.780]  And then pretty soon it'll just be plugged into your brain.
[2:48:48.780 --> 2:48:52.780]  And again, it's all about control just to get you dialed into false reality.
[2:48:52.780 --> 2:48:56.780]  So you'll accept, oh, billions died the last year.
[2:48:56.780 --> 2:49:01.780]  We're safe here in the great node city of Agulu or whatever it is.
[2:49:01.780 --> 2:49:05.780]  And then, oh, I'm going to just get back into my plug-in system.
[2:49:05.780 --> 2:49:08.780]  Bring me back for exercise in one month.
[2:49:08.780 --> 2:49:15.780]  I'm going to go back to my, you know, the kingdoms I'm ruling in the cybernetics system.
[2:49:15.780 --> 2:49:19.780]  And then you go off into your La La Land and then you're just unplugged later.
[2:49:19.780 --> 2:49:22.780]  They're going to have the robots in your house spying on you,
[2:49:22.780 --> 2:49:26.780]  which the CIA chief said two months ago, all appliances.
[2:49:26.780 --> 2:49:29.780]  They're going to be there doing everything for you, working at the factories.
[2:49:29.780 --> 2:49:32.780]  You're not going to be needed anymore because of the robotics.
[2:49:32.780 --> 2:49:33.780]  The military is not going to be needed.
[2:49:33.780 --> 2:49:39.780]  It's all going to be robots working on robots as we've shown you their documents and videos on air.
[2:49:39.780 --> 2:49:40.780]  This is the plan.
[2:49:40.780 --> 2:49:45.780]  As soon as the technocratic skin is in, the robotics, the drones, the weaponized system,
[2:49:45.780 --> 2:49:51.780]  at the moment they've beta tested and ready to go, they'll release the first bio weapon plague.
[2:49:51.780 --> 2:49:53.780]  That's what they didn't give you in a little forecast.
[2:49:53.780 --> 2:49:56.780]  Again, that will wipe out 10 to 15 million people.
[2:49:56.780 --> 2:49:58.780]  I'm giving you a prime projection.
[2:49:58.780 --> 2:50:02.780]  That will be used in the next five to 10 years after that attack is launched.
[2:50:02.780 --> 2:50:05.780]  Next month could be 10 years from now because they are behind.
[2:50:05.780 --> 2:50:07.780]  And fighting them, we'll back them off, by the way.
[2:50:07.780 --> 2:50:09.780]  This is a death struggle we're in.
[2:50:09.780 --> 2:50:14.780]  Once they launch that bio attack, that first phase is just make everybody scared.
[2:50:14.780 --> 2:50:16.780]  Millions dead, total fear.
[2:50:16.780 --> 2:50:19.780]  Anybody will take any shot they're told to, quote, be safe.
[2:50:19.780 --> 2:50:22.780]  That will implant them with all sorts of nasty nanotech and things.
[2:50:22.780 --> 2:50:29.780]  And soft kills and hormone-triggered viruses for age discrimination.
[2:50:29.780 --> 2:50:32.780]  Lower hormones, it's triggered, they admit that.
[2:50:32.780 --> 2:50:34.780]  That's one of their main kill rates.
[2:50:34.780 --> 2:50:39.780]  Also, they like to add pathogens to things like the tetanus shot for just a good old-fashioned attack pattern.
[2:50:39.780 --> 2:50:45.780]  And an infestation of the organs with different pustules and things that have a nice painful soft kill effect
[2:50:45.780 --> 2:50:48.780]  that also weighs down the country that you're hitting with it.
[2:50:48.780 --> 2:50:49.780]  That's an added goodie.
[2:50:49.780 --> 2:50:56.780]  But then once they've released that bio-level attack, then they'll kill, I think, about 3 billion in the next phase.
[2:50:56.780 --> 2:51:00.780]  Then society will really ratchet down and then...
[2:51:02.780 --> 2:51:07.780]  Folks, have you launched your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on?
[2:51:07.780 --> 2:51:10.780]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[2:51:10.780 --> 2:51:15.780]  Because there's never been a better time to get ready for the winter power outages ahead.
[2:51:15.780 --> 2:51:16.780]  Here's why.
[2:51:16.780 --> 2:51:22.780]  Solar power generators are now available from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[2:51:22.780 --> 2:51:27.780]  Their emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[2:51:27.780 --> 2:51:33.780]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly amidst no fumes and produces electricity from the sun.
[2:51:33.780 --> 2:51:40.780]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own own, whether it's ice storms, brownouts or blackouts.
[2:51:40.780 --> 2:51:43.780]  You'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[2:51:43.780 --> 2:51:49.780]  When the power goes out this winter, you'll be ready with a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.

[2:54:10.780 --> 2:54:17.780]  Okay, about an hour ago we got a phone call by one of the workers there.
[2:54:17.780 --> 2:54:20.780]  That's all I'm going to say. We're going to get back in touch with them.
[2:54:20.780 --> 2:54:22.780]  I'm not going to say he or she.
[2:54:22.780 --> 2:54:26.780]  Right after the show ends, and we'll have this on the nightly news tonight, they said,
[2:54:26.780 --> 2:54:31.780]  the University of Texas facility, they have a level four bioweapons lab on the coast that got hit by a hurricane.
[2:54:31.780 --> 2:54:34.780]  It's level two security, but level four.
[2:54:34.780 --> 2:54:37.780]  That's got stuff that will kill 90% of those that come in contact with it.
[2:54:37.780 --> 2:54:40.780]  Mousepox, you name it.
[2:54:40.780 --> 2:54:46.780]  That it's a nanotech weapon system facility, Department of Defense.
[2:54:46.780 --> 2:54:49.780]  Whatever you guys do with the document cameras, don't show my notes here.
[2:54:49.780 --> 2:54:57.780]  It'll give this away, and they're practicing high-powered systems that can fire nanotech viruses into people at such high speed,
[2:54:57.780 --> 2:55:00.780]  and they're so small, you don't even know you've been hit by them.
[2:55:00.780 --> 2:55:02.780]  The perfect weapon.
[2:55:02.780 --> 2:55:04.780]  And again, UT is involved.
[2:55:04.780 --> 2:55:10.780]  They've got a huge monkey farm out there with stuff that, well, one researcher told me it kills 97% of the monkeys.
[2:55:10.780 --> 2:55:12.780]  God almighty.
[2:55:12.780 --> 2:55:16.780]  It's right out in Bastrop, outside Bastrop by Smithville.
[2:55:16.780 --> 2:55:20.780]  I was given a tour one time of the psychology department.
[2:55:20.780 --> 2:55:22.780]  I'll never forget it.
[2:55:22.780 --> 2:55:25.780]  And a lot of it was classified, but they're like, oh, don't look at those monitors.
[2:55:25.780 --> 2:55:26.780]  That's classified.
[2:55:26.780 --> 2:55:31.780]  Oh, that's all the monkeys in the big death pits all hooked up with wires in their heads,
[2:55:31.780 --> 2:55:35.780]  hitting them with flicker rates for the Pentagon to test how to soft kill you and your family through the television,
[2:55:35.780 --> 2:55:37.780]  how to put you into that state.
[2:55:37.780 --> 2:55:41.780]  I mean, I'm just a primitive human who was able to break the basic programming in an emergency system,
[2:55:41.780 --> 2:55:44.780]  warning you here, and they're building all this stuff everywhere.
[2:55:44.780 --> 2:55:47.780]  Got a nano tech place down the street from us right here.
[2:55:47.780 --> 2:55:49.780]  But it's just one of the fake groups out there.
[2:55:49.780 --> 2:55:51.780]  All these groups are out there trying to get funding.
[2:55:51.780 --> 2:55:54.780]  There it is, nano technology at the University of Texas.
[2:55:54.780 --> 2:56:00.780]  Anyways, we're told about this when we look it up and the person told us it's a cover up.
[2:56:00.780 --> 2:56:04.780]  We've been in contact with KXAM, one of our crew, one of our reporters used to work there.
[2:56:04.780 --> 2:56:06.780]  He quit there to come to work here.
[2:56:06.780 --> 2:56:07.780]  He called them.
[2:56:07.780 --> 2:56:08.780]  They're looking into it.
[2:56:08.780 --> 2:56:13.780]  UT experiment explodes, hospitalizes one person as minor energies leak.
[2:56:13.780 --> 2:56:15.780]  Now under control.
[2:56:15.780 --> 2:56:19.780]  And it said during the experiment with the nano tech gun.
[2:56:19.780 --> 2:56:23.780]  Oh, the explosion that happened during the experiment.
[2:56:23.780 --> 2:56:27.780]  The University of Texas high velocity projectile research facility.
[2:56:27.780 --> 2:56:29.780]  Send one person to the hospital Tuesday.
[2:56:29.780 --> 2:56:31.780]  They got thousands of these things everywhere.
[2:56:31.780 --> 2:56:36.780]  The motorist driving by the building at 300 North Baghdad road.
[2:56:36.780 --> 2:56:42.780]  He wouldn't even have heard of this and people didn't see the building blow up was hit by shrapnel from the explosion and taken.
[2:56:42.780 --> 2:56:46.780]  Who knows how many that they say it's a lot worse with the media saying again.
[2:56:46.780 --> 2:56:48.780]  I haven't talked to I haven't talked to him yet.
[2:56:48.780 --> 2:56:53.780]  They just took these notes down the reporters did and taken to round rock medical with minor injuries.
[2:56:53.780 --> 2:56:57.780]  According to Rhonda Weldon, director of communications for university operations.
[2:56:57.780 --> 2:57:00.780]  Yeah, up north there too, they got nuclear reactors.
[2:57:00.780 --> 2:57:09.780]  And the city is so pre program when I tell you they're doing experiments at one of the biggest experimental reactors in North America.
[2:57:09.780 --> 2:57:12.780]  They just say Alex quit fair mongering. It doesn't exist.
[2:57:12.780 --> 2:57:17.780]  I know there were reactors in Austin.
[2:57:17.780 --> 2:57:20.780]  Yeah, yeah, there's two of them. Yeah, yeah, two reactors.
[2:57:20.780 --> 2:57:25.780]  Well, really, they still got a little ones when I'm told that they can never completely shut down in downtown and they got the two up north.
[2:57:25.780 --> 2:57:26.780]  So I guess that's three.
[2:57:26.780 --> 2:57:33.780]  But the point is and you got professors like pionka wandering around there going soon 90% of this will be dead.
[2:57:33.780 --> 2:57:35.780]  I'm prepared for my family today.
[2:57:35.780 --> 2:57:37.780]  Lucifer.
[2:57:37.780 --> 2:57:39.780]  Yeah, you go to his UT website.
[2:57:39.780 --> 2:57:46.780]  It's him dressed up on the official website in a in a outfit is a druid and talking about Lucifer.
[2:57:46.780 --> 2:57:49.780]  I'm in biology department soon.
[2:57:49.780 --> 2:57:50.780]  Everyone will be dead.
[2:57:50.780 --> 2:57:51.780]  We're releasing it soon.
[2:57:51.780 --> 2:57:53.780]  The FBI went and said, what are you talking about?
[2:57:53.780 --> 2:57:54.780]  He goes, never mind.
[2:57:54.780 --> 2:57:56.780]  I'm just an old man.
[2:57:56.780 --> 2:58:01.780]  He went to the Texas Academy of Sciences and again standing ovations when he said they're going to kill everybody.
[2:58:01.780 --> 2:58:09.780]  Yeah, that's beautiful. We're powerful.
[2:58:09.780 --> 2:58:13.780]  Anyways, this is just all part of the insane power trip is going on.
[2:58:13.780 --> 2:58:15.780]  And again, I'm not insane.
[2:58:15.780 --> 2:58:17.780]  You're insane if you're not concerned about this.
[2:58:17.780 --> 2:58:19.780]  And I think about this.
[2:58:19.780 --> 2:58:21.780]  Who cares about Rand Paul Ron Paul?
[2:58:21.780 --> 2:58:22.780]  Okay, they're great.
[2:58:22.780 --> 2:58:24.780]  I endorse Mitt Romney.
[2:58:24.780 --> 2:58:25.780]  Fine.
[2:58:25.780 --> 2:58:29.780]  That's like rearranging the silverware on the Titanic or something.
[2:58:29.780 --> 2:58:32.780]  Whatever. Fine. We shouldn't be freaked out about this.
[2:58:32.780 --> 2:58:33.780]  Move forward.
[2:58:33.780 --> 2:58:34.780]  Warn people.
[2:58:34.780 --> 2:58:35.780]  Hope humanity survives.
[2:58:35.780 --> 2:58:36.780]  That's the best we can do.
[2:58:36.780 --> 2:58:38.780]  I'll break this down on the nightly news tonight.
[2:58:38.780 --> 2:59:00.780]  7 o'clock, present button on TV.
