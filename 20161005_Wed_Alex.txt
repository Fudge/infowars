[00:00.000 --> 00:24.640]  From the Infowars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas, broadcasting
[00:24.640 --> 00:30.640]  worldwide, you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic
[00:30.640 --> 00:36.160]  technocracy tank goper. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:36.160 --> 00:56.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Wednesday, October 5th, 2016. I'm your host, Alex Jones. We're
[00:56.800 --> 01:00.400]  going to be here live for the next four hours. Paul Watson will be hosting the fourth hour, Dr.
[01:00.400 --> 01:07.280]  Jerome Corsi, three-time, number one New York Times bestseller. Political expert will be joining
[01:07.280 --> 01:14.000]  us, not just on campaign 2016, but also the global economy, Deutsche Bank and more, because that's
[01:14.000 --> 01:19.680]  where he's a real expert is on banking and the world economy. Though he's known for politics,
[01:20.240 --> 01:26.800]  he's a master of many hats. He'll be joining us. Wow. Unbelievable debate last night.
[01:26.800 --> 01:35.680]  Governor Pence completely cleaned the floor with Tim Kaine, and I've got to be really,
[01:35.680 --> 01:41.280]  really frank with everybody. I don't normally get scared, but there's something scary about a weird
[01:41.280 --> 01:50.560]  demonic weasel in control of the country, something weird about a Nellie tyrant, something creepy.
[01:51.440 --> 01:56.320]  I'm not creeped out by a woman, but if a woman's a tyrant, I'm creeped out. If a strong man is a
[01:56.320 --> 02:04.240]  tyrant, I'm creeped out by it. But when they're a weird Nellie type kind of grimer, wormwood, sneaky,
[02:04.240 --> 02:11.280]  rat-like person, it gives me the willies. And I'm even more freaked out now. In fact, I'm so in
[02:11.280 --> 02:17.760]  sync with Donald Trump because he's just a common sense guy. I've said many times, Tim Kaine looks
[02:17.760 --> 02:23.200]  like a crook. He looks like, I'm going to be honest, he looks like a child molester to me.
[02:23.200 --> 02:28.560]  I mean, he looks like the archetypal child molester. And I'm not saying he's a child molester.
[02:28.560 --> 02:32.960]  He just looks like what I would think of as a child molester. And I'm sorry to have to talk
[02:32.960 --> 02:37.680]  like that. I just, I'm going to be honest. Well, Donald Trump tweeted out that he looks like an
[02:37.680 --> 02:45.680]  evil crook. And that's a nicer way of saying it. Tim Kaine comes off as really evil, really slimy,
[02:45.680 --> 02:50.160]  really sneaky. And I just was completely honest with everybody and I can't help it.
[02:50.160 --> 02:56.320]  In fact, I apologized to Tim Kaine. I didn't even plan this, but it's the truth and I can't hold
[02:56.320 --> 03:02.080]  back anymore. He's probably not that, in fact, I'm sure he isn't. I know he's an evil globalist.
[03:02.080 --> 03:08.480]  No, he wants our guns, wants open borders. He wants to rape the country. He wants to molest
[03:08.480 --> 03:13.840]  our Bill of Rights and Constitution. But I'm sorry, he looks like central casting if I was a
[03:13.840 --> 03:22.560]  Hollywood producer. And I was hiring a slimy looking person to play the part of a person that
[03:22.560 --> 03:29.840]  like swindles families or, you know, does really horrible stuff or that like, you know, sold kids
[03:29.840 --> 03:35.520]  on an auction block and, you know, in an underground base in Vegas to Saudi Sheik's, you know,
[03:35.520 --> 03:40.480]  hypothetical horror movie, you know, that really goes on. I would, I would typecast,
[03:40.480 --> 03:47.280]  you know, I would say Tim Kaine is the man. I kind of unintentionally troll the media. You
[03:47.280 --> 03:50.720]  know, that's going to be a headline all over the country today and that's fine because truth is
[03:50.720 --> 03:58.880]  truth. And if I look at a beautiful Vista sunrise in Colorado, I describe it as I see it. If I look
[03:58.880 --> 04:03.760]  at Marilyn Monroe in her prime, juiciness comes to mind and just feminine goddess.
[04:03.760 --> 04:12.160]  When I talk about Donald Trump, he is a over the top, aggressive, masculine, pro-America golden
[04:12.160 --> 04:19.040]  code, code like creature, a magical toad. I look at Tim Kaine and I see rack and ruin,
[04:19.040 --> 04:24.240]  I see the fall of this country, I see defeat. Only more evil looking creature out there,
[04:24.240 --> 04:28.240]  I would say. And of course, her actions follow that is Hillary with the big rubber
[04:28.240 --> 04:40.080]  plastic joker mask that she saw. Here's Hillary for two years. And I know they're going to take
[04:40.080 --> 04:42.720]  that shot and make me look crazy. I don't care because I'm fighting the New World War. That's
[04:42.720 --> 04:46.640]  my job is to be destroyed of needy, exposing these people. But I'm hitting the barbed wire
[04:46.640 --> 04:51.840]  and hurting them bad. Big debate highlights, tons of massive news. You name it. The latest on the
[04:51.840 --> 04:56.000]  hurricane, stay weather. I'm out of shones. They want to censor this transmission for good reason.
[04:56.000 --> 04:59.360]  We're hurting them and hurting them bad with the truth. Implewars.gov.
[05:26.320 --> 05:31.600]  a rapid series of ratifications in China, the U.S. and Europe and other leaders will likely move
[05:31.600 --> 05:37.040]  quickly to join this deal to stop any future debate. The U.S. is locked into it and once it
[05:37.040 --> 05:42.400]  takes effect, the U.S. cannot back out of the plan or force changes to it for at least four years.
[05:42.400 --> 05:47.840]  Now, Trump has opposed this deal since December and his initial criticism was that it unfairly
[05:47.840 --> 05:53.200]  favors other countries and treats America's energy industry poorly. The U.N. is ramming forward
[05:53.200 --> 05:57.440]  any measure that they know Trump will oppose when he assumes office like this climate change
[05:57.440 --> 06:24.080]  mandate. I'm Margaret Hale reporting for info wars.com. It's so easy to get these incredible

[08:04.880 --> 08:14.080]  It's Wednesday, October 5th, 2016. We are now only 33 days from decision time.
[08:14.080 --> 08:20.720]  You're listening to the undisputed number one voice globally against the new world order.
[08:21.280 --> 08:31.360]  This is the Alex Jones show. Ladies and gentlemen, we are now only 33 days out
[08:31.360 --> 08:37.200]  from one of the most important, if not the most important elections in the 242 year history
[08:37.200 --> 08:45.360]  of this greatest republic to ever be on the face of the earth. The new Atlantis founded
[08:46.720 --> 08:51.120]  by Liberty lovers in the UK. What is the UK today from jolly old England?
[08:53.200 --> 08:57.520]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, get ready because I am going to be a good boy today.
[08:57.520 --> 09:02.720]  I am going to really socket to the enemy and I am going to go through a whole bunch of debate
[09:02.720 --> 09:10.240]  highlights from last night. I let the crew take over since I did the Assange non-event
[09:10.240 --> 09:16.000]  wiki tease coverage the night before. The crew did a great job. That full three plus hour coverage
[09:16.000 --> 09:24.000]  and the debate is on info wars.com if you missed any of it. Wow, where to begin? And if you are a
[09:24.000 --> 09:28.160]  longtime listener and you have friends and family, you want to wake up, you can go get our three hours
[09:28.160 --> 09:33.680]  of debate coverage, send it to them and say, Hey, this is really interesting. This might change your
[09:33.680 --> 09:40.320]  mind because we hit things from an angle that the establishment media doesn't. This is an info war.
[09:40.320 --> 09:44.080]  So I know you, the listeners are awake in a lot of cases more awake than I am.
[09:44.800 --> 09:50.960]  What I'm asking you to do is to go out and to wake up others. And obviously, you know that,
[09:50.960 --> 09:55.920]  but we need to consciously do that every single day before I get into the debate that
[09:55.920 --> 10:03.680]  Governor Pence clearly won in a huge, huge margin. Even mainstream liberal media is having to admit
[10:03.680 --> 10:11.280]  it because the trouncing was so over the top. Despite that, they are still trying to spend
[10:11.280 --> 10:18.240]  things for creepy cane. Now in the last segment, if you just joined us, I said he looks like somebody
[10:18.240 --> 10:23.920]  I wouldn't let my children stay with as a babysitter. He looks like a creep. He looks like the Grinch
[10:23.920 --> 10:30.400]  that stole Christmas. He acts like a creep and he's all tied into the Jesuits and the rest of
[10:30.400 --> 10:35.040]  it. So you know all that weirdness that's going on and the guy is trying to sell out our sovereignty,
[10:35.040 --> 10:40.000]  get rid of our borders and take our guns. And so I made the point. I said he looks like a child
[10:40.000 --> 10:45.040]  molester and I'm sorry. He's known as creepy cane. I'm not saying he's a child molester. I don't
[10:45.040 --> 10:50.560]  believe that. I'm not trying to imply that. I'm saying I wouldn't buy a stick of bubblegum from
[10:50.560 --> 10:55.520]  this guy and I wouldn't associate with him because he gives me the willies and the back of my spine
[10:55.520 --> 11:00.720]  crawls when I look at him. And I've been saying this since he selected him that he looks like a
[11:00.720 --> 11:05.360]  creep. Now he's known as creepy cane on the internet and we're not just saying this to defeat
[11:05.360 --> 11:09.920]  Hillary. He looks like a wicked joker. He looks like a wicked cross between the Grinch and the
[11:09.920 --> 11:15.680]  Joker. I mean he just has the mannerisms of a freaking demon. The return of the Grinch,
[11:15.680 --> 11:20.800]  Tim Cain, the Grinch. I mean he looks like, like Renfield, like the servant of Dracula,
[11:20.800 --> 11:30.160]  a cross between Quasimodo and Renfield and the Grinch and I don't know, Jeffrey Dahmer. I mean
[11:30.160 --> 11:35.120]  I'm sorry. I mean if I was going to cast a creepy serial killer that grabs kids out of the back of
[11:35.120 --> 11:41.360]  their yards and puts them in white pervert vans, I would cast him. He has a shot in Hollywood.
[11:41.360 --> 11:47.600]  He could be the number one star in the world playing the part of child kidnappers. This is the
[11:47.600 --> 11:54.080]  guy that is trying to kidnap our country right now. Yes, I've taken the gloves off and I put brass
[11:54.080 --> 12:02.640]  knuckles on. Get ready. It's day 33. I'm going in through and beyond absolutely caution to the wind.
[12:02.640 --> 12:10.960]  You want the real deal. You want clobbering time. You want the gloves off. You got it.
[12:13.200 --> 12:17.360]  Because I can tell you, ladies and gentlemen, unequivocally, there is not going to be any
[12:17.360 --> 12:22.720]  future in this nation if we don't reverse this. Look at this headline and have a video clip.
[12:23.440 --> 12:27.680]  I didn't see that in my video list. I forgot to ask you guys, please get it. And then the other clip
[12:27.680 --> 12:32.880]  of the chairman of the Joint Chief saying something similar two weeks ago, US Army Chief threatens
[12:32.880 --> 12:39.280]  war with Russia. We will beat you harder than you've ever been beaten before. He said, prepare
[12:39.280 --> 12:47.680]  for a war as big as World War II to the US Army and other armed services. And that's because
[12:47.680 --> 12:53.360]  the neocons running Obama have begun to prepare for a war with Russia and they're trying to trick
[12:53.360 --> 12:58.960]  Russia into a response. And the October surprise and CNN has hinted at this and others have is a
[12:58.960 --> 13:04.880]  war with Russia. And again, I said this last week, it finally clicked because I was so close to the
[13:04.880 --> 13:09.200]  problem I couldn't see the elephant in the room or the mushroom cloud in the room. I kept saying,
[13:09.200 --> 13:17.040]  why do they accuse Trump and Pence and myself and Drudge and Breitbart and everyone under the sun?
[13:17.040 --> 13:21.200]  I mean, actually put us on TV and put my head beside Putin's and Trump's and say,
[13:21.200 --> 13:25.920]  I mean, you heard Hillary in her speech. She said, these alt-right people get their orders
[13:25.920 --> 13:30.160]  from Putin. He's their godfather. This is the most I get my orders from common sense,
[13:30.160 --> 13:34.880]  Bill of Rights Constitution and my family name and the spirit of God that pulls my strings.
[13:35.680 --> 13:38.640]  I certainly don't get it from Vladimir Putin. I mean, get never been been to Russia.
[13:39.280 --> 13:43.920]  Don't have one drop of Slavic blood in me, but I don't want to have war with Russia for no reason.
[13:43.920 --> 13:48.480]  I know the elements. I know what's going on and it hit me. It clicked like a ton of bricks hitting
[13:48.480 --> 13:55.440]  me in the head from a thousand feet up. Oh my gosh. They want to put their opposition in a corner
[13:55.440 --> 13:59.920]  when they start a war. That's one of their main plans to bring in permanent emergency
[13:59.920 --> 14:06.240]  and martial law and rationing and all the controls and agenda 21 is through a war.
[14:06.240 --> 14:10.640]  Globalism is rationing is the end of prosperity is a command and control economy where the
[14:10.640 --> 14:16.240]  globalist picked the winners were there above the law and it hit me. That's why they're encircling
[14:16.240 --> 14:19.360]  Russia with weapons. That's why they're trying to start a war. That's why they're destabilizing
[14:19.360 --> 14:22.800]  these countries and overthrowing them like Ukraine and turning the Middle East over to radical Islam
[14:23.440 --> 14:27.520]  because they're going to ally with radical Islam against Russia in a war and then flood
[14:27.520 --> 14:32.320]  Europe with Islam to conquer it and then conquer us as well as a police state using the threat of
[14:32.320 --> 14:38.000]  Islam. But Europe is slated to be given to to to Islam and it all just crystallized. Then I can go
[14:38.000 --> 14:42.800]  read white papers where they're actually saying this is their plan. So it's so diabolical. It's
[14:42.800 --> 14:48.000]  led by weirdos with huge jack-o-lantern heads like Hillary that look like rubber joker faces
[14:48.000 --> 14:52.720]  and creepy cane creeping around. I mean you ask why would they do something so evil because these
[14:52.720 --> 15:00.720]  are evil people and let me explain something else to you. Do you know who the neocons are?
[15:00.720 --> 15:05.360]  Let's be extremely clear about this okay. I've studied it. I've read their books. They're from
[15:05.360 --> 15:10.960]  the Chicago Business School in Harvard. They took it over. The Trotskyites ran with billions of
[15:10.960 --> 15:20.080]  dollars of gold and diamonds and other goodies. They robbed when Stalin kicked Trotsky out of the
[15:20.080 --> 15:26.800]  country okay. This is pre-World War II. He was later killed in Mexico City with a ice axe.
[15:27.760 --> 15:31.200]  The old days they hacked up big you know big bills ice where you got your ice from an ice house
[15:31.200 --> 15:36.240]  not from your refrigerator or freezer. I mean you'll probably say it's a conspiracy theory
[15:36.240 --> 15:40.080]  that we never had you know ice houses. But the point is he was killed with that but I'm going into
[15:40.080 --> 15:46.000]  it too. Little fact toys don't matter. With the billions just like the Bushes were the main Nazi
[15:47.200 --> 15:51.760]  lawyers. Prescott Bush is on record. That's been made London Guardian New York Times Associated
[15:51.760 --> 15:56.320]  Press. It's invented. The Bushes were the main backmen for a lot of the Nazi money in South America
[15:56.320 --> 16:00.000]  and Central America. That's why they're secretly so powerful is because they're so incredibly rich.
[16:00.000 --> 16:05.760]  It's why you know 30-something year old guy as soon as he turns 40 is made director of the CIA.
[16:05.760 --> 16:11.840]  Nobody ever did that before. Or George Herbert Walker Bush. And Skull of Bones was founded by
[16:11.840 --> 16:19.920]  the Germans. It's a Germanic death cult but a side issue. The Trotskyites had billions reportedly
[16:19.920 --> 16:25.120]  in stolen Russian loot from Christians and other people they'd robbed from Poland to Ukraine to
[16:25.120 --> 16:30.000]  Russia proper. And they got kicked out by Stalin. Say what you want about him. He kicked the
[16:30.000 --> 16:37.920]  Trotskyites led by Leon Trotsky. They all ran to Mexico and then changed their names and stuff
[16:37.920 --> 16:43.040]  and went into the U.S. with all this money. And that's who founded. This is in the Washington Post
[16:43.040 --> 16:48.640]  by the way. And this is not secret. This is who founded the modern neocons and they took over
[16:48.640 --> 16:54.000]  the Republican Party and their mission was always to reconquer Russia. And so you wonder why it's
[16:54.000 --> 17:00.400]  like a suicide mission to get Russia. It's because grandpa and daddy got killed by the Russians
[17:00.400 --> 17:05.280]  and most of the Trotskyites didn't make it out. But their kids did. And now their kids kids.
[17:08.800 --> 17:13.760]  Crystal all of them are the neocons. They sit their neck real friendly and real nice. These guys
[17:13.760 --> 17:18.880]  are actually sitting reportedly on huge again underground wealth like the bushes and are super
[17:18.880 --> 17:24.320]  powerful with communist money that they brought into the country and look at how they run things. So
[17:25.600 --> 17:29.280]  that's why they're trying to start a war. But we have the chairman of the Joint Chiefs last week.
[17:29.280 --> 17:32.480]  We have that clip where he said that okay you want to know flies only got to have war with Russia.
[17:32.480 --> 17:37.760]  Do you have the clip? I'm going to play that clip in the next segment and then I want to get to
[17:37.760 --> 17:44.960]  this article. U.S. Army Chief threatens war with Russia. We will beat you harder than you've ever
[17:44.960 --> 17:48.960]  been beaten before. It goes on and says this war will be bigger than anything we've seen this
[17:48.960 --> 17:55.440]  generation and will be the size of World War II get prepared. That's Army Chief of Staff General
[17:55.440 --> 18:05.520]  Mark Milley warned last night that the United States was ready to quote destroy its enemies
[18:05.520 --> 18:11.920]  in comments that were clearly directed at Russia. I want to be clear to those who do wish to harm
[18:11.920 --> 18:17.840]  us the United States military despite all of our challenges despite our operational tempo despite
[18:17.840 --> 18:23.040]  everything we've have been doing we will stop you and we will beat you harder than you've ever
[18:23.040 --> 18:28.000]  been beat before. Make no mistake about it. The general went on to warn that Russia and other
[18:28.000 --> 18:33.760]  countries have taken advantage of U.S. being focused on the war on terror. So he goes on
[18:34.480 --> 18:40.640]  and puts Russia in the same group as North Korea and China that our government has been
[18:40.640 --> 18:44.800]  arming and giving nuclear reactors to and missile secrets everything else Russia's got two and a
[18:44.800 --> 18:49.760]  half military bases one small port and two other bases they're not attacking anybody
[18:50.880 --> 18:57.120]  and that's why they're being targeted and they're being encircled and they think this is going to
[18:57.120 --> 19:05.760]  be the detonator for the full takeover of society and he goes on to say he cautioned that the next
[19:05.760 --> 19:09.520]  major conflict would quote be lethal unlike anything our army has experienced at least
[19:09.520 --> 19:14.400]  since world war two and would involve fighting in highly populated urban areas make no mistake
[19:14.400 --> 19:19.200]  about it we can now and we will retain the capability to rapidly deploy he said and we
[19:19.200 --> 19:25.680]  will destroy an enemy anywhere anytime he concluded yeah I mean I guess you know 20 million
[19:25.680 --> 19:30.320]  Germans did die in world war two and I guess they had the same idea because the Russians were
[19:30.320 --> 19:34.640]  willing to have a 20 million people died and not be over I mean 20 million Russians died
[19:34.640 --> 19:41.520]  21 million Germans look it up I mean I get it you can go kill them and because the neocon said
[19:41.520 --> 19:46.400]  so and it's liberal to have world war three and it's fun it's it's trendy and you know you've
[19:46.400 --> 19:50.240]  got the hollywood reporter admitting that the elite are all running to new zealand to sit it out

[24:10.480 --> 24:13.680]  it's on army times dot com by the way have you doubt info wars dot com
[24:14.240 --> 24:18.000]  where he says we're gonna have casualties and basically a war as big as world war two
[24:18.000 --> 24:22.240]  we haven't seen anything like this is world war two we're ready to go to war with russia right now
[24:22.800 --> 24:26.240]  and that's why you saw the chairman of the joint chief's dumford a week and a half ago
[24:26.240 --> 24:30.880]  to say yes you're asking us to do a no fly zone you're asking us that's the full speech
[24:30.880 --> 24:34.240]  we played it a few weeks ago to shoot cruise missiles in and shoot down russian aircraft
[24:34.880 --> 24:41.360]  yes but then they're going to respond to where those missiles came from and that's going to be
[24:41.360 --> 24:47.440]  world war three so the reason generals are coming out and speaking like this is actually to stop
[24:48.240 --> 24:53.920]  the politicians and the neocons and the obama people with hillary from launching world war three
[24:53.920 --> 24:59.360]  i can tell you right now and i'm not lionizing the u.s army but it does not want nuclear war
[24:59.360 --> 25:03.840]  with russia it knows russia is not expanding our our military is actually concerned about china
[25:04.400 --> 25:07.600]  and you notice the politicians have actually listened to that and have pivoted to the pacific
[25:08.880 --> 25:13.040]  but the globalist because they want to take control of the united states have a big war
[25:13.040 --> 25:17.200]  they want to push russia into confrontation they've already got an economic war going but i've
[25:17.200 --> 25:21.520]  got the crew going through the hour-long speech to grab i mean i read to you where he says as big
[25:21.520 --> 25:28.080]  as world war two you know like this is world war two we can destroy you we're ready for war
[25:28.080 --> 25:34.160]  we're on the verge of war and i just see these clips out of russia every day i see these clips
[25:34.160 --> 25:38.320]  out of the pentagon every day and i keep warning people and they have mainstream news articles
[25:40.400 --> 25:46.400]  making fun of us saying we're fearmongers none of this is going on so the trendies can all just
[25:46.400 --> 25:52.080]  sit around making jokes all day this isn't funny i have three children that's why i'm taking the
[25:52.080 --> 25:56.320]  gloves off you know what if i think tim cayne looks like a weird pervert i'm going to say it
[25:56.320 --> 26:02.000]  he acts like one he acts like a political molester of the constitution the gloves are off
[26:02.000 --> 26:06.880]  brass knuckles are on you people are not starting world war three do you understand
[26:09.200 --> 26:12.720]  the communist chinese basically run our media now and have their product placement everywhere
[26:12.720 --> 26:16.160]  they're the ones taking over all the rare of men roles all the major ports the panamoc
[26:16.160 --> 26:21.120]  canal they got their agents everywhere russia is on the verge of collapse and you're trying to start
[26:21.120 --> 26:30.000]  world war three with them it's bull and the same globalist did the october revolution in 1917 on
[26:30.000 --> 26:35.440]  record the same globalist funding black lives matter and revolution here are the very same
[26:35.440 --> 26:40.240]  grandchildren of the same robber baron elites and people that are doing all this remember
[26:40.240 --> 26:44.960]  hillary a month ago threatened russia with war if we think russia launches a cyber attack
[26:44.960 --> 26:49.520]  will physically attack we have that then i'm going to play the chairman of the joint chiefs
[26:49.520 --> 26:54.240]  general dumford but here is hillary clinton just to remind you of how serious the situation is
[26:55.360 --> 27:01.120]  you've seen reports russia's hacked into a lot of things china's hacked into a lot of things
[27:01.120 --> 27:08.000]  russia even hacked into the democratic national committee maybe even some state election systems
[27:08.960 --> 27:14.400]  so we've got to step up our game make sure we are well defended and able to take the fight to
[27:14.400 --> 27:21.840]  those who go after us as president i will make it clear that the united states will treat cyber
[27:21.840 --> 27:29.440]  attacks just like any other attack we will be ready with serious political economic and military
[27:29.440 --> 27:35.520]  response in a month before that nato said its new policy is if they think someone in russia
[27:35.520 --> 27:42.400]  launches a cyber attack they attack russia we covered that at the time and no one seemed to care
[27:42.400 --> 27:46.080]  there's the headline from the hill clinton treat cyber attacks like any other attack
[27:46.080 --> 27:52.080]  respond militarily now coming up we have tim kane the creepy kane as he's known
[27:53.520 --> 27:56.560]  i don't know if he's a pervert but he certainly looks like a creep an excellent creep and is
[27:56.560 --> 28:03.040]  anti-american and wants open borders saying that terrorism is over it doesn't exist really ices calls
[28:03.040 --> 28:09.360]  for random knife attacks in alley's forest and beaches and less than one day later three belgium
[28:09.360 --> 28:14.960]  police officers stabbed and suspected terror attack as they scream a la oct bar all over malls in the
[28:14.960 --> 28:21.520]  u.s all over malls in kenya malls in germany malls in france malls in belgium this is what goes on
[28:22.400 --> 28:31.040]  cops at parks cops getting out of their car you know being stabbed nothing to do with islam though
[28:32.080 --> 28:36.880]  oh isis that's the group that has absolutely nothing to do with islam you've opened our borders
[28:36.880 --> 28:42.640]  up you little trader with hillary and now you tell us terror doesn't exist like you control reality
[28:43.360 --> 28:47.520]  let's go to this clip of the chairman of the joint chiefs saying yeah i can follow your orders
[28:47.520 --> 28:51.360]  i can launch cruise missiles right now they're like can't you just shoot down the russian planes
[28:51.360 --> 28:57.920]  yeah then russia will respond two plus two equals four these people are crazy let's go to the clip
[28:58.480 --> 29:04.160]  for syria what about the option of controlling the airspace so that that barrel bombs cannot be
[29:04.160 --> 29:11.920]  dropped all all the options uh what do you think of that option sir right now senator for us to
[29:11.920 --> 29:18.000]  control all of the airspace in syria would require us to go to war against syria and russia
[29:21.120 --> 29:24.400]  that's a pretty fundamental decision that certainly i'm not going to make
[29:26.080 --> 29:29.440]  so that's why you have the chairman of the joint chiefs coming out and now you have the head of
[29:29.440 --> 29:33.280]  the army coming out saying all right we're ready to fight russia because they know the elites are
[29:33.280 --> 29:36.560]  telling them go to war so they're trying to make russia back down yeah we're ready to take you on
[29:36.560 --> 29:41.040]  russia and we're ready to have something big as world war two is the public listening we're
[29:41.040 --> 29:45.280]  ready to have a war as big as world war two we're ready to have a war we're ready to go to war if
[29:45.280 --> 29:51.440]  you order stupid is that what you want everybody won't a new world war a new world war we're on
[29:51.440 --> 29:57.280]  the march that's what they're saying the world war three what's called run alex jones and the gcn radio
[29:57.280 --> 30:05.920]  network last night's vice presidential debate centered heavily around the topic of russia
[30:05.920 --> 30:10.800]  and in the event of potential military theater who would best be able to handle vladimir putin
[30:10.800 --> 30:15.840]  one thing is clear the u.s russia relationship has been in a free fall the obama administration
[30:15.840 --> 30:21.840]  proclaimed bilateral peace talks over syria are quote dead with mosco and suspended a 16 year old
[30:21.840 --> 30:26.720]  treaty meant to reduce the risk of nuclear proliferation the u.s state department threatened
[30:26.720 --> 30:31.680]  russia over their actions in syria and according to the white house spokesperson josh earnest he
[30:31.680 --> 30:37.200]  said everybody's patience with russia has run out continuing on saying russians have been complicit
[30:37.200 --> 30:42.240]  in the syrian tragedy well this comes as the u.s announced this week that we're withdrawing personnel
[30:42.240 --> 30:47.440]  dispatched to the middle east in anticipation of a ceasefire deal reached on september the night
[30:47.440 --> 30:52.240]  putin is also withdrawing only he's withdrawing from an accord that committed both countries to
[30:52.240 --> 30:57.360]  eliminating stockpiles of plutonium plutonium that's used as the core material in some types of
[30:57.360 --> 31:03.040]  nuclear weapons i'm margaret hell reporting for info wars dot com not a group you develop living

[33:33.360 --> 33:39.360]  hard to believe it's already october 5th 2016 was when this day edition only 33 days until election
[33:39.360 --> 33:46.960]  day and then one more day epic day so i guess 34 days total until you know el presidente is
[33:46.960 --> 33:53.760]  i kind of smell a tie i kind of smell a deadlocked supreme court and then a big constitutional
[33:53.760 --> 34:01.040]  crisis is magically that supreme court justice died so there could be a deadlock yes a lot of
[34:01.040 --> 34:09.840]  things are afoot and we're not in camo lot anymore are we we're more like in mordor all right uh
[34:10.640 --> 34:17.520]  earlier i spent time if you just joined us with the head of the army saying we're about to possibly
[34:17.520 --> 34:22.240]  have a war uh in fact it was more gracious than that he said basically we're preparing it looks
[34:22.240 --> 34:28.320]  like we're gonna have a war that we haven't seen since world war two that means world war three
[34:29.120 --> 34:36.560]  and that the army is ready to take on russia and then he mixed in like north korea and china and
[34:36.560 --> 34:42.560]  i ran into that but the main target is russia that's why he said russia first he cautioned the next
[34:42.560 --> 34:46.880]  major conflict would be highly lethal unlike any our army has experienced at least it's world war
[34:46.880 --> 34:54.480]  two and would involve fighting in highly populated urban areas why do you think they're talking like
[34:54.480 --> 35:00.320]  this now because that's how the trotskyites that run the government to a great extent are able to go
[35:00.320 --> 35:04.960]  out to their political opposition when this happens is they say everyone against world war three
[35:04.960 --> 35:09.360]  everyone against open borders everyone against carbon taxes everyone against the e u takeover
[35:09.360 --> 35:13.440]  everyone against the u n running our schools and our police departments under the strong
[35:13.440 --> 35:19.360]  cities initiative it's all being announced washington post now u n overseeing our elections

[35:26.320 --> 35:31.280]  fight the evil tea party and you're like this doesn't make sense this is backfiring this is
[35:31.280 --> 35:35.760]  discrediting them not if there's a big war in europe not if there's a limited nuclear exchange
[35:35.760 --> 35:40.000]  everybody'll get real scared and get in line at least that's what the establishment thinks
[35:40.000 --> 35:47.280]  and then the very people trying to bring us a soviet style occupation the leftist globalist
[35:47.280 --> 35:54.400]  control freaks they're talking about hillary's fun camps can have a command and control economy
[35:54.400 --> 36:00.880]  that they sit on top of and become fabulously wealthy with and settle their scores with their
[36:00.880 --> 36:07.200]  political enemies just like they've said on msnbc of course we audit and arrest tea party and
[36:07.200 --> 36:12.400]  christians and conservative groups you're racist you don't have a right to exist and hillary gets
[36:12.400 --> 36:18.080]  up and says the alt right i'm gonna shut them down when i get in office and she means business
[36:18.800 --> 36:25.760]  so you know what sweety cake we mean business too brass knuckles just went on i think jim kane
[36:25.760 --> 36:32.800]  looks like a child molester i'm gonna say it because i know the public doesn't have the time
[36:32.800 --> 36:36.160]  here about hardcore political facts in world war three but stuff like him looking like a
[36:36.160 --> 36:40.640]  child molester sticks doesn't it because you know what the shoe fits doesn't it he just looks like
[36:40.640 --> 36:47.760]  the creepiest weirdo you can dredge up how to hell itself out of some nightmare so you want us to
[36:47.760 --> 36:52.960]  play rough sweetie we're gonna play rough now you want to see it go up another level up up up up

[37:06.800 --> 37:11.040]  because you've been pushing around a lot of strong good people thinking we're weak thinking
[37:11.040 --> 37:17.520]  we're cowards you've been taking our reluctance and our restraint as weakness you've taken our
[37:17.520 --> 37:24.880]  chivalry as weakness when you know deep down we're not weak the new world order wants a fight
[37:24.880 --> 37:33.600]  they want an info war they want to go beyond those lands the lands of fire
[37:35.520 --> 37:39.760]  you think little hunchback wimpy creatures like hillary clinton go into the lands of fire
[37:40.720 --> 37:46.320]  she hates those that go into the lands of fire she wants to destroy those people while she
[37:46.320 --> 37:53.440]  simultaneously uses them against our enemies and the men that come from the lands of fire see you
[37:53.440 --> 37:59.120]  hillary and they know who you are and they know who obama is and who george soros is and who
[37:59.120 --> 38:04.800]  michael moore and all these pig-like creatures are with their bodyguards hating poor americans
[38:04.800 --> 38:09.360]  making fun of bernie sanders supporters as basement dwellers who you helped put in the basement
[38:11.360 --> 38:14.320]  well here's a little news flash sweetheart we're coming out of the basement

[38:38.320 --> 38:42.320]  what stone says i've found to be very very accurate this is the first time he's ever been wrong
[38:42.320 --> 38:48.720]  about the wiki licks thing and i learned that assigns has got two lawyers one in the u.s one

[39:07.280 --> 39:11.680]  waiting on some type of deal totally scared he's been in there four plus years i haven't
[39:11.680 --> 39:16.320]  been in his shoes i got mad sitting up you know till five in the morning and and feeling like i got
[39:16.320 --> 39:19.920]  chumped now know what happened so i'm gonna say it because i'm a big man when i'm wrong

[39:26.080 --> 39:30.640]  started sweating folks i figured it out i just have like a actual physical response now in my
[39:30.640 --> 39:35.360]  body to just help setting top generals talking about a war as big as world war two nuclear war
[39:35.360 --> 39:39.600]  is about to happen the russians headlines are saying get ready for nuclear war totally freaks me out

[39:56.960 --> 40:01.120]  talking about nuclear war and the russians quoting them saying get ready with 40 million people doing
[40:01.120 --> 40:13.680]  a drill in major cities but getting back to assange they did come out yesterday we have the
[40:13.680 --> 40:19.760]  clip coming up after a place of debate clubs his lawyer did go on alga's here and said within a
[40:19.760 --> 40:25.440]  couple days we will release the clinton quote all the clinton information so that's good that's what
[40:25.440 --> 40:29.280]  i wanted to hear i believe you're already planning it i think because of the pressure you're doing
[40:29.280 --> 40:35.360]  the right thing do it but all i'm saying to you is i apologize i'm not in your shoes i'm somewhat
[40:35.360 --> 40:39.360]  your shoes but not in your shoes like you are assigned i think you're a hero you've got a great
[40:39.360 --> 40:46.240]  track record and i apologize for calling you names and being mean at five a.m. in the morning um i i
[40:46.240 --> 40:54.320]  just i i i got angry and uh i really can't stand hillary clinton and i was projecting my angry for
[40:54.320 --> 41:00.160]  the i was projecting my anger for hillary and the new world order on to you and you've already done
[41:00.160 --> 41:05.120]  so much in the fight that you could quit everything now and you're a hero just don't betray anybody
[41:05.120 --> 41:10.080]  and don't destroy the fact that you are a hero so i apologize to julien assange from the bottom of
[41:10.080 --> 41:19.360]  my heart that i went off the rails um the other night and said those things so i'm done talking
[41:19.360 --> 41:25.200]  about it now we don't see some stuff released by the end of the week i'm going to say clearly they
[41:25.200 --> 41:29.840]  got to him but he's been a soldier for 10 years and okay they got to him we got to move on now
[41:29.840 --> 41:34.080]  please give the information to somebody else we got a new goose for 2.0 leaked it's even bigger
[41:34.080 --> 41:37.520]  got a lot of others coming out we've got to analyze these data dumps right now that means
[41:37.520 --> 41:40.960]  everybody out there listening needs to get into these we're linked to them and then full wars.com
[41:40.960 --> 41:45.120]  we've got folks on it right now but it's a mountain of evidence to go through uh and we're
[41:45.120 --> 41:50.240]  going to be obviously putting that information out as fast as we can in this information war but
[41:50.240 --> 41:58.000]  when i'm wrong i'm wrong and i apologize to julien assange because you don't deserve what i said and
[41:58.000 --> 42:02.800]  what i did i think it would have been smart to apologize and say some things have come up i can't
[42:02.800 --> 42:06.400]  do it at this time but we've brought up some important information trust us more is coming
[42:06.400 --> 42:14.960]  i had the feeling of being chumped and so i attack when i get attacked but it just it's
[42:14.960 --> 42:20.080]  just in the aggregate in the great sum total it's not fair so i apologize i'm done
[42:22.320 --> 42:28.640]  i love how the media makes it a thought crime to criticize sometimes four or five islamic
[42:28.640 --> 42:33.600]  standings a week in the united states that they successfully cover up oh yeah i've talked to police
[42:33.600 --> 42:37.440]  and others for every stabbing you hear about the guy yelling a lot bar there's three or four five more
[42:37.440 --> 42:41.120]  but we're having a few a week already europe's having them every day in major cities they're just
[42:41.120 --> 42:46.080]  killing whoever they want the media just calls it crime and when you see these calls go out to stab
[42:46.080 --> 42:51.600]  people it intensifies and now you're seeing three belgium police officers stabbed and suspected terror
[42:51.600 --> 42:56.400]  attack that's the mirror out of the uk and that's one day after ices calls for random knife attacks
[42:56.400 --> 43:04.000]  in alleys forest and beaches and because that's come up i want to first go to this clip from last
[43:04.000 --> 43:11.680]  night here's kane saying terrorism is dead cbs here's tim kane the grinch and when i say he's the
[43:11.680 --> 43:18.240]  grinch i don't literally mean he's the grinch from dr seuss for the mainstream media out there
[43:18.240 --> 43:21.760]  was confused i'm i'm saying he looks like the grinch when i when i say he looks like a child
[43:21.760 --> 43:27.520]  molester i mean he looks creepy that's what donald trump tweeted he says he looks like a kane looks
[43:27.520 --> 43:33.440]  like an evil crook i'd say evil pervert but but whatever his actions are what matter but but let's
[43:33.440 --> 43:40.320]  go to kane raping the truth here gentlemen i'd like to shift now to the threat of terrorism do you
[43:40.320 --> 43:46.880]  think the world today is a safer or more dangerous place than it was eight years ago has the terrorist
[43:46.880 --> 43:52.560]  threat increased or decreased senator kane the terrorist threat has decreased in some ways because
[43:52.560 --> 43:57.760]  ben laden is dead the terrorist threat has decreased in some ways because an iranian nuclear weapons
[43:57.760 --> 44:02.880]  program has been stopped the terrorist threat to united states troops has been decreased in some
[44:02.880 --> 44:08.640]  ways because there's not 175 000 in the dangerous part of the world there's only 15 000 but there
[44:08.640 --> 44:13.040]  are other parts of the world that are challenging let me tell you this to beat terrorism there's only
[44:13.040 --> 44:20.080]  one candidate who can do it and it's hillary clinton who literally is the founder of modern isis
[44:20.080 --> 44:26.000]  funding al-qaeda out of libya and who gave them weapons on record and if you google the caliphate
[44:26.000 --> 44:32.080]  they want it's ultra massive if you look at where they already are it's huge they have spread into
[44:32.080 --> 44:42.000]  26 countries last time i checked i mean it is a serious situation ladies and gentlemen isis global
[44:42.000 --> 44:45.600]  presence and then that's not counting europe in the u.s it's actually much much worse than
[44:45.600 --> 44:48.720]  of your tv viewer you can see that for radio listeners these are countries where they're
[44:48.720 --> 44:58.320]  battling to actually take control serious serious serious situation okay let's start
[44:58.320 --> 45:01.120]  going to these clips here because some of these are just over the top ridiculous
[45:03.120 --> 45:09.440]  let's go ahead and go to chris mathews admits that governor pence won the debate the vice
[45:09.440 --> 45:13.600]  presidential debate kane looked desperate at times yeah kane looks like
[45:16.800 --> 45:22.960]  somebody you wouldn't do business with not just how he physically looks but the eyes the mannerisms
[45:22.960 --> 45:29.440]  that you know the sneakiness of him very very rat like very very rinfield very very uh again
[45:29.440 --> 45:34.880]  back stabbing let's let's go to that clip and yeah heading up our coverage there chris mathews chris
[45:34.880 --> 45:40.240]  brian i thought it was very illuminating i thought that mike pence did all the things
[45:40.240 --> 45:44.000]  right that donald trump did wrong his body language was excellent he was very good on
[45:44.000 --> 45:47.760]  reaction he looked like a grown-up every time whatever his words were and of course he was
[45:47.760 --> 45:51.840]  playing with a couple deuces against the guy with a full house so it was very difficult for him
[45:51.840 --> 45:56.160]  in terms of the issues i mean he had to defend donald trump but he came across as a grown-up
[45:56.160 --> 46:00.560]  strong i thought he's very effective at being a conservative but i really think he accomplished
[46:00.560 --> 46:05.120]  tonight has made himself probably the front runner for the republican nomination in 2020
[46:05.120 --> 46:09.280]  he had all the bases on the conservative side he was pro-life rather eloquent on it at the end
[46:09.280 --> 46:13.280]  you may not agree with him but he was eloquent i also thought he was very good on the policing
[46:13.280 --> 46:17.600]  issue for the conservative side very strong against the legal immigration on the conservative side
[46:17.600 --> 46:23.680]  so he really did so there's chris mathews knowing everybody knows that pence destroyed him i mean
[46:23.680 --> 46:29.680]  i would say a plus 97 i mean it was spiked the balinese zone 10 or 15 times in a football game
[46:29.680 --> 46:38.240]  it was a route you know 75 to three it was huge huge as trump would say now expanding on that he
[46:38.240 --> 46:42.720]  goes further he says hillary who didn't even do the iran deal it was you know mainly a secretary
[46:42.720 --> 46:48.720]  of state carry it's a horrible deal but he then takes credit for the elimination of the iranian
[46:48.720 --> 46:53.040]  nuclear weapons program that has been accelerated into high gear and i don't want war with iran
[46:53.040 --> 46:57.200]  i'm not a big sabre rattler when it comes but the proof is this is a horrible deal donald trump
[46:57.200 --> 47:03.120]  has been advised by generals that know their stuff and so here's kane claims that clinton eliminated
[47:03.120 --> 47:10.800]  the iran nuclear weapons program she also discovered the north pole here it is she worked a tough
[47:10.800 --> 47:17.040]  negotiation with nations around the world to eliminate the iranian nuclear weapons program
[47:17.040 --> 47:22.720]  without firing a shot eliminate the iranian absolutely without firing a shot and instead of
[47:22.720 --> 47:30.480]  175 000 american troops deployed overseas we now have 15 so we already played kane saying terrorism
[47:30.480 --> 47:34.880]  is dead have you thought that one last one was funny now here's pants rips hillary over basket
[47:34.880 --> 47:40.000]  of deplorables uh comment just as general flin dead saying the military are like deplorables
[47:40.000 --> 47:43.920]  that's like the people that found in this country are supposedly deplorables that were lexington
[47:43.920 --> 47:48.880]  and concord so here's pants going on the offensive about deplorables something i wish trump would
[47:48.880 --> 47:54.000]  have done 10 or 15 times here it is economy strengthen the rule of law in the country and make
[47:54.000 --> 47:58.560]  our community safer once the criminal aliens are out then we'll deal with those that remain
[47:59.200 --> 48:04.160]  but i i have to tell you i just i was listening to the avalanche of insults coming out of senator
[48:04.160 --> 48:09.920]  kane a minute ago these these were donald's he says he hold on a second my time senator it is
[48:09.920 --> 48:15.600]  in fact i apologize this is your two minutes thanks i forgive you he says ours is in an insult
[48:15.600 --> 48:21.680]  driven campaign did you all just hear that ours is an insult driven campaign i mean to be honest
[48:21.680 --> 48:26.320]  with you if donald trump had said all the things that you said he said in the way you said he said
[48:26.320 --> 48:33.200]  them he still wouldn't have a fraction of the insults that hillary clinton level when she said
[48:33.200 --> 48:41.520]  that half of our supporters were a basket of deplorables it's that she said they were irredeemable
[48:41.520 --> 48:47.520]  they were not america i mean it's extraordinary and then she labeled one after another ism
[48:48.080 --> 48:53.440]  on millions of americans who believe that we can have a stronger america at home and abroad who
[48:53.440 --> 48:57.760]  believe we can get this economy move it again who believe that we can end illegal immigration
[48:57.760 --> 49:04.480]  once and for all so senator this this this uh in insult driven campaign i mean we're that small
[49:04.480 --> 49:09.120]  potatoes compared to hillary clinton called senator half of donald trump supporters a basket
[49:09.120 --> 49:13.360]  of deplorables hillary clinton's had something on the campaign trail in the very next day she said
[49:13.360 --> 49:17.280]  you know what i shouldn't have said that she said she said look look at her governor this is senator
[49:17.280 --> 49:22.800]  can's two minutes look yeah that's right so now hit pause it back in five seconds it's the very of
[49:22.800 --> 49:29.280]  the clip all of the surrogates i mean all of them went on cnn msnbc you name it and said it's not
[49:29.280 --> 49:34.800]  half of them it's all of them your minions most of them former obama and clinton operatives i mean
[49:34.800 --> 49:40.800]  that's who's on face the nation meet the press cnn it's all their former chiefs of staffs and
[49:40.800 --> 49:46.080]  deputy chief of staffs and press secretaries since when did that happen the last 10 years started
[49:46.080 --> 49:51.440]  with stefan operas it's their people infesting getting direct talking points and then he claims
[49:51.440 --> 49:56.880]  that she backed off of that no she didn't she had her surrogates go into high gear
[49:56.880 --> 50:05.120]  so he's lying let's go to the next clip because we have this pulled up this is general flan
[50:05.120 --> 50:08.640]  two and a half weeks ago talking about the deplorables we never got to this part of his
[50:08.640 --> 50:13.600]  speech uh where he you know says how dare her call uh supporters of trump deplorables when
[50:13.600 --> 50:19.280]  he's got like 85 support and major polls from vets again it's a total distortion in fact
[50:19.280 --> 50:24.320]  i saw an article i think was a washington post this morning about pits calls illegals people
[50:24.320 --> 50:32.080]  here illegally uh you know you know criminal aliens calls migrants criminal aliens what he
[50:32.080 --> 50:39.760]  did was use the law enforcement term criminal aliens not their criminals they're here criminals
[50:39.760 --> 50:44.960]  that they've committed felonies that's who trump's gonna go after in fact a lot of hardcore
[50:44.960 --> 50:49.600]  conservatives and maybe people that are a little bit racist that don't want this country to be
[50:49.600 --> 50:56.720]  basically like latin america with the you know bloodlines or whatever they are actually mad at
[50:56.720 --> 51:00.720]  trump because he's had a plan for over the decade he's talked about to make it easier to come here
[51:00.720 --> 51:06.400]  legally see they're gonna make it easier if you're not a criminal to come here you're just not gonna
[51:06.400 --> 51:10.640]  get a bunch of free stuff that's what trump's doing bring good people here from latin america and i
[51:10.640 --> 51:15.520]  want to tell the minority of white people that are racist out there and who don't like his panics
[51:15.520 --> 51:20.800]  and they are there let's just be honest about this it is a minority of people white people
[51:20.800 --> 51:26.960]  aborted all their babies basically half of them so people that don't kill their kids
[51:26.960 --> 51:32.400]  that's who is on the planet so that's darwin awards you kill your kids you don't deserve to
[51:32.400 --> 51:38.080]  go on i don't care if the if the united states is 80 brown in 30 years as long as they're pro gun
[51:38.080 --> 51:42.080]  pro family want to go to the stars want to have freedom and don't want to be slaves
[51:42.080 --> 51:48.320]  and we need to get past what color we are and adopt the system of ideas and look i know
[51:48.880 --> 51:52.880]  i i see videos every day i don't even play anymore of black people in hispanics mainly
[51:52.880 --> 52:00.320]  black people beating up homeless white people white women you know teenagers uh uh uh 16-year-old
[52:00.320 --> 52:05.840]  women with their kids at the park because they're white it's like the kkk riding down black people
[52:05.840 --> 52:10.320]  and you've got birth of a nation coming out you know hyping race war and the rest of it
[52:10.320 --> 52:16.000]  from a 101-year-old movie relive the past bring all this up because it's all the globalists can do
[52:16.000 --> 52:19.920]  they've robbed everybody they've doubled black unemployment they've screwed everyone over all
[52:19.920 --> 52:25.040]  they can do is create division in this country so yes it's true i'll tell you the quote minorities
[52:25.040 --> 52:31.280]  are way more racist than white people i live it i've seen it i'm 42 years old five times more
[52:31.280 --> 52:37.360]  racist because the media has said it's not racist when you're racist and quote people with brown
[52:37.360 --> 52:43.840]  skin can't be racist that's total crap it's tribalism you'll have one tribe on one side of a river
[52:43.840 --> 52:48.080]  that's brown and another tribe is brown the very same bloodlines they'll kill each other
[52:48.080 --> 52:53.600]  it's over land it's over resources it's it's the idea of i go take something from somebody
[52:53.600 --> 53:00.960]  that's how i get ahead that's conquest versus renaissance i want a renaissance system
[53:00.960 --> 53:12.160]  i want a system where we all get better together we're under a eugenics system that's the opposite
[53:12.160 --> 53:19.200]  that promotes unity while it creates absolute division so later i'm going to get into a review
[53:19.200 --> 53:23.120]  of the new movie birth of a nation that's totally meant to cause a race war and shows black people
[53:23.120 --> 53:27.040]  you know being having atrocities happen to them so they go out and kill a bunch of white people
[53:27.040 --> 53:31.040]  and then people go out and find some random homeless white guy and kill him because you know
[53:31.040 --> 53:37.120]  he's a white devil that's what this is and it targets the most poor ignorant people in this
[53:37.120 --> 53:42.800]  country and then it's going to create white racism as well it's total divide and conquer it's brutal
[53:42.800 --> 53:48.480]  it shows how evil this elite is and why this elite needs to be removed immediately now i'm
[53:48.480 --> 53:53.840]  going to be countering birth of a nation and and in all these movies like jango and you know the
[53:53.840 --> 54:00.800]  Weinstein brothers and quentin tarantino they know what they're doing robert rodriguez meets at
[54:00.800 --> 54:06.720]  the white house gets government funding to put this crap out to make sure hispanics stay in the
[54:06.720 --> 54:11.920]  barrio under the control of their democrat controllers who are nothing but race pimp
[54:11.920 --> 54:16.320]  eugenicists who hope to break up your families and get you so dependent like the average black
[54:16.320 --> 54:21.440]  person they can kill every child you're about to have so you want to live you want to have kids
[54:21.440 --> 54:25.920]  don't take the guard is still shot don't eat gmo listen to me i want you to live
[54:25.920 --> 54:31.360]  because i want to treat you like i want to be treated i'm not the devil i'm the opposite of that
[54:31.360 --> 54:36.320]  and these people that say they're your leaders they want to kill you and your family and in your
[54:36.320 --> 54:45.600]  gut you know it vote donald trump if you want to live it's that simple death is what the globalists
[54:45.600 --> 54:52.880]  have to offer period all right let's get to the next clip here let's go to general flinn because
[54:52.880 --> 54:58.080]  i'm mentioning the former head of defense intelligence here it is the first thing i want
[54:58.080 --> 55:04.880]  to address is this notion of deplorables and i will tell you you know if and if it's a bad
[55:04.880 --> 55:09.920]  job honor to wear and i don't consider myself a deplorable person but if it's a bad job honor
[55:09.920 --> 55:16.080]  to wear you know when you think about the individuals who who ran out to lexington common and formed
[55:16.080 --> 55:21.520]  up against the british to really begin a sort of to fight for american patriotism to fight for
[55:21.520 --> 55:26.400]  something that they believed in or as they as they trail back to the north bridge and you
[55:26.400 --> 55:30.960]  hear you you're ultimately with the shot around the rule which is where that shot came from and
[55:30.960 --> 55:36.880]  they fought back an aggressor at that time now you take that all the way forward to all the
[55:36.880 --> 55:41.840]  men and women who have served and continue to serve in our in our combat zones around the
[55:41.840 --> 55:47.040]  world today i mean these are not deplorable because these are individuals who care deeply for our
[55:47.040 --> 55:52.800]  country and i will tell you you know we should you know we should continue to respect the idea
[55:52.800 --> 55:58.320]  of patriots and people who are willing to volunteer and get the last measure of devotion this country
[55:58.320 --> 56:04.240]  if required in order to fight for it and what we have right now in this country is we have a deficit
[56:04.240 --> 56:07.440]  very deficit of leadership in this country right now
[56:10.320 --> 56:15.920]  he is a patriot he is exposed that obama and hillary run al-qaeda and isis and that he was
[56:15.920 --> 56:20.160]  ordered to give them support and he refused to follow the order it went to the joint chiefs
[56:20.160 --> 56:24.320]  and they did a deal with russia to start giving the intel to the russians and the targeting
[56:24.320 --> 56:32.240]  to begin taking them out on the invite of the us military russia boldly came in under huge casualties
[56:32.240 --> 56:39.200]  wiped out isis wiped out al-qaeda bombed them did raids took them out rolled them up into two towns
[56:39.200 --> 56:45.200]  and now obama's removed every general he can put in new people and has them bombing the russians
[56:45.200 --> 56:49.600]  and others oh they're but they're bombing russians too that's why russia is so upset to try to stop
[56:49.600 --> 56:55.440]  them i've been told this by our pentagon sources and so this is bad folks and that's why russia is
[56:55.440 --> 56:59.760]  all freaking out and that's why you've got these generals the new ones they've put in
[56:59.760 --> 57:03.360]  are being told you've got to go to war with russia and they're going to congress going
[57:04.240 --> 57:07.760]  do you really want us to have war with russia that's what you're asking us to do that they're
[57:07.760 --> 57:14.800]  warning everyone to have a debate people they're warning everyone because we have crazy people
[57:15.680 --> 57:21.200]  like george soros and tim canan others that will end this planet if they have their way
[57:23.200 --> 57:28.000]  they're megalomaniacs they must be stopped the threat isn't russia people the threat is tim canan
[57:28.000 --> 57:32.400]  and george soros and hillary clinton and barack obama they're the clear and present danger they're
[57:32.400 --> 57:37.360]  the occupiers they represent the foreign banks that they're going to sit in new zealand and be

[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:31.040]  death blow politically to the clinton's if trump pulls the sword from the stone and follows this
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:35.360]  idea which i'm sure he's already thought of and goes and actually renders aid and exposes the
[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:39.680]  clinton foundation with the leader of the Haitian senate and others that have said that they're
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:44.960]  being robbed by them the clinton's took billions it will be devastating and it will reverse all

[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:20.640]  apologize for getting overly mad i'm saying international governments have made a power play
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:25.760]  against donald trump by ratifying international climate deal earlier than expected effectively
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:30.080]  preventing him from canceling the deal as he was promised to do well he can have us pull out of the
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:35.040]  stupid treaty the european unions tuesday decision to join the paris climate deal will push the deal
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:40.320]  over the threshold for ratification but we haven't ratified it will formally take effect in 30 days
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:44.720]  that means trump should be elected president november could not cancel or renegotiate the terms
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:49.120]  of agreement oh we're going into global government this is the carbon tax and they claim that
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:55.840]  we can't get out of it congress hasn't ratified the stinking thing but obama says he's signing
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:04:01.440]  that's the hill buffaloing everyone lying i'll talk about that but dr jurum coursey coming up
[01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:08.320]  everything's moving this is the planet's conjuncting politically culturally but even the stars they've
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:14.720]  been doing at levels never seen but every few thousand years i mean it's all happening but the
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:20.960]  stars aren't aligning for evil the stars are neutral i don't mean that in a form of actually
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:29.600]  going into astrology i mean politically we must govern the affairs for ourselves we must take
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:37.600]  this liquid period this flux period and change it with the greatest weapons alchemy has ever seen

[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:56.880]  go over his harvard university top of his class 1972 expert in political violence and terrorism
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:09:02.400]  advisor in the state department and other agencies and other classified work but you know if you
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:07.200]  think he's famous for politics even more famous for banking so today while he's with us for much
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:11.360]  of the hour i want to cover a lot of different issues i want to cover the debate last night
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:15.920]  what he thinks of creepy cane i want to cover what he thinks the next 33 days we should be
[01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:20.320]  doing to make sure trump gets in what do you think of the announcement that the oe cd's
[01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:26.640]  paramilitary arm is going to be overseeing the election with 10 times the quote eu moderators
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:31.840]  and overseers they've ever seen uh what does he make of the un trying to accelerate their
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:36.000]  climate treaty claiming they don't care what congress does as long as obama agrees it's
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.720]  going to be ratified i believe that's unlawful we'll get his expert analysis but obviously
[01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:47.440]  the reason he's coming on is a big exclusive at world net daily of massive atrocities committed
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:53.040]  when hillary wanted libya to be a failed state it's been confirmed the qaddafi was ready to give up
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:59.120]  unconditionally after he was premeditatedly attacked and still they wanted to fail state so this just
[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:05.200]  shows what a monster hillary is he's got that report at wnd.com see hillary's libyan jihad
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:10.240]  atrocities i want to warn you we have these videos too from the same source but they gave it to us
[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:14.160]  after they were going to go with which is fine we get so many data dumps we can't even cover it all
[01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:18.960]  we're on the same team uh we're going to play some of these probably today but probably not put them
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:25.520]  on youtube i mean this is al qaeda slash well hobbyist isis chopping innocent people's heads off
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:31.360]  murdering children mass graves you name it i mean this is a big story it's at wnd.com it
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:36.080]  dub tells with our big exclusive that comes out of the same data dump hillary killed libya
[01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:40.800]  peace deal over personal vendetta on monday we have the former head of the black caucus coming on
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:45.440]  who was there and met with qaddafi more than 20 times and he was saying look i'll just go don't
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:51.680]  give the country over to isis al qaeda at the time i will just leave just just don't kill all the
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:56.960]  ethnic minorities the black tribes and others that the racist Arabs and they think don't think blacks
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:03.120]  are humans folks they kill them so this is a giant giant scandal uh so we can cover this in any order
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:09.360]  dr corsie uh wants to uh so i mean look at the hill this sounds like something corsie right 15 years
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:16.320]  ago at world net daily un makes power play against trump we've got openly the washington post saying
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:21.680]  reparation for blacks in america the un runs strong cities federalizing police with the justice
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:27.200]  department george soros is openly trying to create a race war we get his emails that are hacked by
[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:33.520]  dc leaks it confirms it all i mean this is put you this way i sounded nuts 20 years ago
[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:38.160]  course he didn't because he had so many degrees and background he wouldn't even go as far as i
[01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:43.120]  do but you know he'd get attacked uh you know lou dobs all of us have been vindicated matt drudge
[01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:50.240]  you name it joseph era now though it's like surreal because it's crazier than i even thought
[01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:56.880]  so i'm almost left behind now some days where things are so crazy i'm like i knew she was selling out
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:12:02.480]  u.s interest i didn't know she was brokering for the chinese president against chinese interest i mean
[01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:09.280]  it's like levels worse than i thought so where do you want to start with the debate with the election
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:16.560]  with uh the un takeover with the atrocities uh with hillary's health i mean dr corsie where
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:21.200]  should we be where should we start let's start with libya i mean i think the libya is really
[01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:28.960]  important we're running complementary stories i mean your your story on the abdication and the
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:35.600]  inside that you've got that there were major initiatives made and kadafi was willing to step
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:42.320]  down i've reported this as well with a couple of other efforts uh admiral kubik and african had
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:49.040]  an effort going congressman kurt welden had an issue going to try to get kadafi to abdicate
[01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:55.120]  uh this uh you've got because you don't want to turn the country over to al qaeda right exactly and
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:13:01.600]  i mean look and and it was a peaceful transition kadafi was cooperating with the obama administration
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:06.400]  kadafi was holding libya together sure i'm not even against overthrowing their military if you put
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:11.280]  something better in but no we put something 10 times worse than on purpose and it's a document
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:17.200]  of that hillary switch side she's supported al qaeda we were bringing in weapons through ambassador
[01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:23.200]  stevens that ultimately ended up in syria with the radicals the foreign mercenaries and foreign
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:26.480]  i want you to back up i'm going to shut up for five minutes to give you the floor start over
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:30.400]  this is on record now this is what ben gazi this is the key to ben gazi you're about to break it
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:35.440]  you have these exclusive documents she literally switched sides double dealing it's clear so did
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:41.360]  obama let's break it down for people this is huge well it the christ stevens mission in ben gazi
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:46.720]  was running guns we were running guns with hillary clinton doing it and by the way that was confirmed
[01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:53.920]  again even yesterday when this uh arms dealer mark terry uh was the department of justice
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:14:00.560]  just declined to prosecute him now mark terry had the goods as do i i've interviewed mark terry
[01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:06.800]  i've interviewed his lawyer uh hillary was planning to run gun deals and was running gun deals
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:13.840]  into libya illegally and lying to the american people terry had the inside on it and they
[01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:20.880]  prosecuted terry over a gun running operation to libya but he didn't actually complete because
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:25.760]  hillary stepped in and blocked it but the whole purpose of this ben gazi compound was for hillary
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:33.440]  to to provide arms to the al-qaeda terrorists and militants largely foreigners coming into libya
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:40.720]  who were going to disrupt the country and what we published now on wnd is a series of the first
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:46.640]  three well we have as many as 25 videos right now some of them are so horrific we're debating
[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:55.280]  publishing them but these show uh violence in qaddaf in ben gazi prior to 9 11 with a government
[01:14:55.280 --> 01:15:01.440]  official being dragged out of a building and viciously stabbed to death by the mob of shouting
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:10.560]  a lock bar etc this is a again a not a peaceful demonstration by any means and there's two videos
[01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:18.080]  of libyan soldiers who have been qaddafi's troops who have been apprehended by the al-qaeda
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:22.960]  terrorists foreigners brought into the country by hillary clinton one of them is just horrific and
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:32.080]  say sodomize the libyan troop is on the ground spread eagled uh naked half naked being sodomized
[01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:37.360]  with the rifle and saying he doesn't know again and knowing and now i should add they're calling
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:41.040]  for the same tactics in the west isis which is the same group is calling for this here sorry go
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:48.160]  ahead oh yes in fact this is the entire isis whole approach and we're again uh backing isis even in
[01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:53.840]  this with Assad this has been part of the the weapons that ultimately after the megazi terror
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:16:00.400]  attack went over to syria and we again were providing access through turkey and through the
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:05.920]  middle east for these weapons to get to syria that we've been on the wrong side of supporting
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:11.120]  muslim brotherhood supporting and that's my next question what is the master game it's confirmed
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:15.360]  obama that you broke years later it came out in the mainstream news running the muslim brotherhood
[01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:20.880]  hundreds of millions out of kenya overthrowing egypt our ally it's so bold but it's now confirmed
[01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:26.080]  what was the master plan how has it gone for them well the master plan i think was to destabilize
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:31.120]  the middle east in favor of the muslim brotherhood i think the obama administration's been muslim
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:37.600]  brotherhood affiliated almost from the beginning humamideen number two aid to hillary clinton you
[01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:44.080]  know is is clearly affiliated through her parents with the muslim brotherhood and i published you
[01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:50.240]  know two-thirds of the emails that humamideen got and she was the go-between with the state department
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:58.320]  and the clinton foundation and tanao humamideen was posting on a yahoo.com personal email account
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:03.440]  she could have given the password and the username to anyone in the world they could have read
[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:09.280]  unredacted state department emails courage so this is how they're passing the intelligence on
[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:14.720]  yeah and this is clearly a crime this is clearly a violation of all the federal statutes excused
[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:20.400]  by the department of justice but it looks to me an obvious sign of espionage and which sets a
[01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:25.280]  precedent for inside espionage operations to carry this out and let's expand on that now
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:30.800]  if you look at what al-qaeda and isis are doing egypt knows this was able to overthrow the the
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:36.080]  muslim brotherhood well hobbyist takeover suddenly allied with russia which they hadn't done in 40
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:41.280]  something years but we now know because of a covert alliance with the u.s military russia
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:47.440]  and egypt to clean things up sy hersh has broke that you've broken that this is an epic story of
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:52.880]  patriots in our government actually countermanding what obama did uh what can you say about that
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:58.560]  from your sources well in fact i've published in wnd we had you know muslim brotherhood walking
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:05.360]  into our embassy in triply getting paid off by the obama administration these were the same muslim
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:11.600]  brotherhood that ultimately some of them were prosecuted under lcc in egypt for being terrorists
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:16.240]  it's absolutely clear and these videos should leave no doubt i mean they're horrific and
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:21.040]  this week we'll publish some videos and beheadings we're going to publish a
[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:27.920]  uh a horrific video of a cab driver who was beheaded by these al-qaeda and other foreign
[01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:31.760]  mercenaries and let me just stop you we've got the videos too but we're letting you go with them
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:36.320]  but we're going to go ahead and play for viewer discretion advice for tv viewers without audio
[01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:40.000]  or limited audio behind what you talk i'ma skip this network right even more time we're going to
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.600]  be playing some of the videos you mentioned again this is a this is government officials being
[01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:48.000]  sodomized with rifles this is children being killed this is horrible stuff but you have you
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:52.800]  need to know what hillary and obama did to bring those jihadis in to take over at north africa
[01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:57.520]  and the middle east so the viewer discretion is advised we're airing this right now viewer
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:01.360]  discretion is advised please continue dr coursey well and you've got to remember too that these
[01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:07.360]  libyan tribes that are providing us a lot of this information and i can confirm that we're dealing
[01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:12.640]  with very legitimate sources you have information we have information from the same sources highly
[01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:20.160]  authenticated the tribes that hillary clinton brutalized in libya are black tribes these are
[01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:25.440]  black tribes that have been racially discriminated for a long time in libyan and the mercenaries
[01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:30.240]  that foreigners that hillary brought in to destabilize libya went against these tribes and
[01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:35.120]  against women there are thousands of women about the war on women and we're and i want to get to
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:38.880]  that i think hillary's weakest spot within the abadian or mother that promotes sexual mutilation
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:45.040]  but we're showing giant piles of dead black people that racist wahhabist have killed that's
[01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:51.280]  it these are these are killed these are soldiers that were faithful to qaddafi give your black
[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:56.160]  your kill let's explain this under wahhabism it's you know that's the point is that these tribes
[01:19:56.160 --> 01:20:04.720]  who are black in libya are targeted by the al-qaeda militia and the al-sar al-shari and the other
[01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:09.600]  mercenaries that hillary brought in to destabilize libya and the black tribes are targeted they're
[01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:14.800]  going to be killed uh they are being killed the women are imprisoned uh the children are
[01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:20.480]  imprisoned thousands uh the women are no longer free they're wearing hot beads and they're wearing
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:26.320]  you know the uh various forms of burqas they're not able to be educated or or be involved in
[01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:32.240]  professions again uh young women are being sold into sex slavery from the tribes in libya yes
[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:37.360]  these are other you know this is a film where the prisoners of libya are actually being forced
[01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:42.480]  to be they're each human slice they're being cannibalized right here in this video you're
[01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:45.840]  showing right now which by the way putin pointed out that they eat hearts there's video of this
[01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:51.040]  they're obsessed with sodomy raping children eating hearts why do why do why do the Saudi
[01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:56.640]  arabian death cult why are they into this it's bizarre i mean the whole thing is bizarre this is
[01:20:56.640 --> 01:21:04.960]  a form of Islam that is completely uh satanic i mean this is a violent TV viewers there's giant
[01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:10.480]  tables chopping up dead humans and then they make them as an initiation to not be killed eat human
[01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:16.640]  flesh that's right these are libian soldiers faithful to qaddafi they're captured and these are
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:22.080]  terrorist mercenaries largely brought in by hillary clinton destabilizing libya and they're
[01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:28.080]  meat making them eat human flesh of other could there you go right there that's an example of it
[01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:33.760]  this is part of the ritual probably most likely these prisoners were later killed
[01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:39.760]  because some of the videos that we have is shown as well are that's right and in fact i i misspoke
[01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:42.640]  a lot of times they do this because they believe it and send them to hell they made them eat human
[01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:47.280]  flesh exactly and then they're shot in the back of the head this is part of the ritual to make
[01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:54.560]  sure their souls are lost in everlasting hell this is a demonizing that the terrorists are doing
[01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:59.840]  to muslims these are all muslims this is violence so these muslims are desecrating these people to
[01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:05.760]  hopefully they go to hell precisely you know the wahhabis are so evil and so ridiculous i've never
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:10.320]  seen anyone act as evil i'm not even top serial killers actor behave like this what is wrong with
[01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:14.880]  these people well and the wahhabism is Saudi arabia and Saudi arabia has been exporting
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:20.080]  wahhabism for 40 or 50 years while we have republicans and democrats alike you know
[01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:26.480]  fond friends of the bushes this is a democratic and republican problem as well as the clinton's
[01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:33.280]  with muslim brotherhood muslim brotherhood owes his origin back to the mufti in jerusalem in 1930s
[01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:38.960]  was affiliated with Hitler the world war two well he saluted him he was he actually fought for him
[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:42.400]  well i mean that's why that the nazis invaded north africa let's expand on that daughter's room
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:48.480]  coursey breaking all this wnd.com dr. coursey then let me ask you this question again the end
[01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:53.680]  game how is it going for hillary and obama these are the bombings that were being done in libya
[01:22:53.680 --> 01:23:01.440]  on civilians by nato nato see remember qaddafi was willing to step down peacefully none of this
[01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:07.360]  war was necessary there was no reason that nato used high tech cluster bombs and weapons to wipe
[01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:11.760]  out the infrastructure and to back the jihad armies so they could rape women put burqas on them
[01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:17.280]  kill them kill qaddafi make people a human flesh kill tens of thousands some of the numbers are
[01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:22.000]  over a hundred thousand uh i mean this is insanity so we're showing you the loving liberal hillary
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:27.520]  who said she came she saw he died we should cue that up again as we narrate this most the audience
[01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:32.480]  is radio we're showing these exclusive videos that we got from a clandestine source let me ask
[01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:36.640]  you this then what is the end game how did it go for hillary though well i think you know this is
[01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:41.680]  becoming american people are becoming increasingly aware of this and it's headline news this mark
[01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:47.280]  turrey the the you know armed deal arms dealer was not going to be prosecuted by the department of
[01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:53.680]  justice i've seen the files i've talked to his lawyer he had the goods to show that the arms
[01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:59.600]  dealing he was doing had been authorized by hillary clinton and hillary clinton wanted to set him up
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:05.600]  and blame him mark turrey because there was a shipment of arms that was interdicted in libya
[01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:11.600]  and the libyan government displayed these with katar stamps and said this is hillary clinton
[01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:18.480]  shipping in weapons to the ansar al sharia in al qaeda to destabilize libya this is what hillary
[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:26.480]  did she made a conscious decision to back the most serious terrorist groups in libya to to
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:31.440]  oppose to depose qaddafi when he was willing to peacefully step down and the violence was
[01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:37.040]  directed against the tribes largely the black tribes and it was vicious against women remember
[01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:41.600]  the women who are in prison were going to be abused in prison even if they're let go these
[01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:47.280]  muslim tribes won't accept them back again because they're going to consider them defiled so it's a
[01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:53.280]  permanent you know ruining every human being which hillary clinton is doing to the women in qaddafi
[01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:59.440]  you know smiling laughing lying about it when and claiming that she is the you know great
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:06.080]  secretary of state who you know achieved peaceful purposes and it's all nonsense obama and hillary
[01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:12.000]  clinton and hillary clinton made the key policy decisions here destabilize all of north africa
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:18.000]  libya uh they destabilize egypt morse and by the way none of this is rhetoric i mean you literally
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:25.200]  and i'm not kissing your butt dr germ course you have wnd.com i'd say broke 50 of the news
[01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:28.880]  with thousands of reporters on this because he has all the sources in the middle east where he worked
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:33.520]  for decades the rest was cy hershin in full wars and hundreds and hundreds of other reporters but
[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:38.080]  you are the expert and you never exaggerates what i love in fact you kind of dial it back
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:42.880]  but i want new listeners understand we're this isn't political season so we're saying this
[01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:48.800]  this is all coming out this is how evil they are our government going out of its way under obama
[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:54.960]  and hillary to back the muslim brotherhood wahhabis to back al qaeda to back isis the russians are right
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:26:00.240]  trump's right she is the founder obama's the co-founder and the good news is it's getting
[01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:04.000]  rolled up and defeated because our own military wouldn't go along with it but correct me if i'm
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:09.280]  wrong suddenly they fired so many generals they finally found groups that will be the air force
[01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:13.600]  and and and you know bomb the syrian military and the russians that's why the russians are so
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:18.000]  angry and now we have the head of the army and we have to have the joint chiefs saying we've been
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:22.880]  asked to start a war with russia to fire cruise missiles on russian aircraft that will go to war
[01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:27.600]  with russia am i authorized to do that you know that's what happened two weeks ago in congress we
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:33.200]  have new clips today so you've got the sources i've got the sources uh i i mean it looks like
[01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:38.560]  obama and hillary are actually trying to push a conflict as an october surprise or am i wrong
[01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:44.240]  dr coursey well i'm beginning to suspect that i mean i think the military is objecting going to
[01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:49.120]  war with russia although the obama administration seems to be pushing in that direction exactly
[01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:52.720]  let's be clear when the head of the army and the joint chiefs comes out and say you want war with
[01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:58.080]  russia you need to get authorization they're not calling for it they're raising the alarm
[01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:03.200]  they're raising now they don't want to go to war with russia over Assad this is not you know russia
[01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:09.440]  is supporting Assad they're going to defeat isis we want to again support isis and russia says
[01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:14.000]  then they'll make Assad step down which i believe well they probably will i mean this is the the
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:18.880]  issue here is that we're not on the good side of it we're not you know black lives matter unless
[01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:23.280]  you're a libyan tribes that's the point we've got to get across unless you're you're the illegitimate
[01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:28.160]  son of bill clinton unless you're daddy williams and black lives don't matter either you know the
[01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:33.520]  point is but i'm asking you as a as an anthropologist sociologist and you know intelligence researcher
[01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:40.080]  i mean smart guy why would soros and obama and hillary ally themselves with the scum of the earth
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:44.960]  just because saudi arabian money i mean why that's just so evil well it's it makes no sense to go to
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:50.880]  war except that the i think the obama's and clinton's are realizing that hillary is going to lose
[01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:56.320]  this is um the first recognition that they've had they're not fooling the american people
[01:27:56.320 --> 01:28:02.400]  trump's crowds are enormous hillary's are very small kane was atrocious in the debate last night
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:07.520]  it was one of the worst performances by a vice presidential candidate i've ever seen in my life
[01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:12.640]  i think kane did even worse than nixon and i never thought no one anyone could do worse than nixon
[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:21.360]  in 1960 kane did uh the uh killery is now i think being exposed on libya if obama thinks the solution
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:26.960]  is to go to war with russia over syria i think he's got another thing coming the american people
[01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:31.600]  do not want a war with russia sure and that fits into this whole narrative that if you don't want
[01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:36.320]  war with russia or or you're for wiki makes you a russian agent i mean that's not going to fly
[01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:41.040]  or that you know that i'm publishing i published one article already i'm going to do another one
[01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:48.400]  hopefully tomorrow uh linking the clinton foundation into russian money laundering that they're
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:54.560]  want money laundering on behalf of the same issues interest in russia they cornered our uranium
[01:28:54.560 --> 01:29:01.200]  market they got the clinton's and obama to do massive technology sure that's the thing everything
[01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:06.560]  they accuse trump is what they've done in triple it's done and in the money laundering it's not
[01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:14.560]  not trump's ties to russia are minimal i mean the clinton foundation is is neck deep in money
[01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:19.440]  laundering i'm talking about money laundering you know that shows up in the panel by the way
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:25.200]  you're a world expert on money laundering people don't know that i exposed the hsbc money laundering
[01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:30.240]  scandal was first if i hadn't written about it i'm sure they would never have gotten the 1.9 billion
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:36.640]  dollar fine that hsbc got and by the way the cover-up artists in that were a comey of the fbi
[01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:40.880]  sure let's talk comey then and the fbi turning against them rightfully so they need to redeem
[01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:46.480]  themselves or the there's no credibility of the federal and you know the bureau and then how that
[01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:51.680]  ties into the foundation where you see that going and more straight ahead with dr corcy we're on the
[01:29:51.680 --> 01:30:03.600]  march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network the united nations international
[01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:09.120]  body just made a serious power play against presidential hopeful donald trump the un ratified
[01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:14.240]  a climate deal earlier than expected effectively preventing him from canceling the deal as he
[01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:18.640]  swore he would do when he becomes president of the united states the group effectively took away
[01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:23.200]  his ability to renegotiate the terms of the agreement or cancel the agreement entirely
[01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:29.520]  his threat to stop the un some say has stimulated a rapid series of ratifications in china the us
[01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:34.160]  in europe and other leaders will likely move quickly to join this deal to stop any future
[01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:39.840]  debate the us is locked into it and once it takes effect the us cannot back out of the plan or
[01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:45.360]  force changes to it for at least four years now trump has opposed this deal since december and
[01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:50.960]  his initial criticism was that it unfairly favors other countries and treats america's energy
[01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:55.360]  industry poorly the un is ramming forward any measure that they know tremble oppose when he
[01:30:55.360 --> 01:31:01.040]  assumes office like this climate change mandate i'm margaret hell reporting for info wars dot com

[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:54.080]  rare woman to be able to say yeah i'm voting for trump and i'm not afraid of it so i think wearing
[01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:59.920]  a shirt like this just puts it out there that hey don't tread on me i am clearly not with her
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:05.040]  so wear it loud and proudly it's meant to find the patriots meant to find who you don't associate
[01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:09.600]  with exactly so you could just zero in on them enough with the tinder and all of that i heard you
[01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:12.720]  talking there in the break just how shocking these videos are and the fact that hillary put
[01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:19.920]  well hobbyist in uh al qaeda isis in libya who murder women sell them into sex slavery i just
[01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:24.000]  can't see how women can support hillary when she's like married to umma abadi you know reportedly
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:28.480]  basically stays in the same hotel room they're fine i'm a libertarian i'm not judging you but
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:33.040]  her mother writes the journal that calls for the sexual mutilation of women and is the leading
[01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:38.160]  proponent of sexual mutilation uh in the world how the hell could any liberal woman vote for this
[01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:44.400]  of this crazy lady no it's very shocking and it's just so how do they continually sweep this type
[01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:49.680]  of stuff under the rug with the sex slavery with the rapes with the killing of gay people
[01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:54.720]  you know these are throwing them off rude if it was anyone else that this they would take
[01:38:54.720 --> 01:39:00.160]  that person down with that type of history but if you're a clinton it's fine you get a pass
[01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:05.520]  i mean this is insane genital mutilation supporter huma abadine's mother she was
[01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:09.440]  huma was there at the journal at the times is going on he's a leading one she she depends

[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:28.720]  like mike pence now that i had the opportunity to just really sit down that's why trump went
[01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:32.480]  with him he's really smart and the clinton campaign is so upset that he didn't take the
[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:36.560]  bait and they're saying well he couldn't defend all of trump's statements that he made it's like
[01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:40.800]  no he didn't take your canned bait trump can learn a lot i'm not saying i'm more than trump i'm
[01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:44.320]  saying pence pence is a master it's also been meeting with our good friend forage that's coming

[01:39:57.520 --> 01:40:00.880]  gonna try to give you the floor but you've got me so excited i've been backing up that you know
[01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:04.320]  the different things have been breaking down we were getting into money laundering the clinton
[01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:10.080]  foundation how crazy this is even the internal emails from state department with uh chelsea
[01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:16.160]  upset about them stealing you know 94 percent of the money from the Haitians Haitian leaders the
[01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:21.120]  president of their senate coming out saying they robbed them all this stuff happening 33 days left
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:26.560]  this cane thing blew up in their face you've got the floor what should we be watching what
[01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:31.600]  should we be looking at that you're covering at wnd.com well let's talk about the money laundering
[01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:38.640]  a bit in the clinton foundation the um you know dylan trump is being hit because he abused a tax
[01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:45.840]  avoidance part of the code a loss a loss carry forward not to pay taxes in subsequent years
[01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:50.720]  which is completely legal now the clinton foundation i've got a documentation on this i'm
[01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:59.120]  preparing for publication tomorrow and probably in the next week the information i've just gotten
[01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:06.640]  from germany which outlines for me some of the um never before seen back channels through which the
[01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:11.280]  clinton foundation has been money laundering with russia that a lot of this money has gone to
[01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:16.320]  pedestal a lot of that money is off the books of the clinton foundation i mean here let's question
[01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:22.640]  how much of the offshore money laundering the clinton foundation does is uh reported for tax
[01:41:22.640 --> 01:41:29.360]  purposes i doubt any of it is reported for tax purposes but the point is this rosa which is the
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:37.840]  wrote the uh russian uh energy agency they bought into 20 of the u.s. uranium production through
[01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:45.360]  this frank juxtra in and uh canada was a penny stock dealer from vancouver connected himself
[01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:51.600]  with the clinton foundation as no is also picked up not only the Panama papers but in the uh swiss
[01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:58.720]  banking uh revelations in terms of offshore money hiding and um i've gotten out of the record of how
[01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:06.400]  the accounts pass money through the clinton's off the books and clinton's using this pass-through
[01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:16.960]  corporation this wjc as initials william jefferson clinton wjcllc as wjc investments as off the
[01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:23.200]  books pass-throughs which is what money launderers use web shell corporation pass-through works is
[01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:29.360]  the money goes into the account and then within a few hours it goes out of the account so you the
[01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:34.400]  account shows a zero balance you don't know what the account has in it or where the money came from
[01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:39.760]  or necessarily where it went this is the way it makes it hard to trace the money and the clinton
[01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:45.120]  foundations have been using the this kind of secret pass-through and again if we really want to get
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:52.720]  into taxes if if the uh clinton's want to push the issue of you know donald trump using a legitimate
[01:42:52.720 --> 01:43:00.160]  tax avoidance it's completely legal uh i think this is illegal activity where even i've got evidence
[01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:08.480]  that uh podesta who is a campaign manager uh did not report as he needed to various transactions
[01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:14.080]  that came to him from russia through these various groups in russia that wanted to do two things
[01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:18.640]  control the oranian production of the united states and have hillary clinton as part of this
[01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:25.680]  restart reset transfer massive amounts of u.s military intelligence and technology to russia
[01:43:25.680 --> 01:43:30.000]  which hillary clinton did you know these are i was about to say i was told by a pretty horrible
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:33.920]  military source that yeah the russians don't think trumps out to get them but they're not
[01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:37.920]  sure if they try to push him around they're kind of scared of him that the word is they
[01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:42.560]  kind of actually want hillary because she's so blackmailed well hillary's completely compromise
[01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:47.760]  hillary all the russians have to do is reveal what the information i got through you know
[01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:53.920]  authoritative sources from germany identifying the russian banks through which these transfers
[01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:58.080]  occur i'm gonna the articles i'm gonna publish are gonna chart it out so you can see the chart of
[01:43:58.080 --> 01:44:02.960]  how the money passes from here to here and here it ends up in the clinton foundation you also
[01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:07.680]  brought up comey i mean he he does the tax returns for the clinton's well he called comey the law firm
[01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:12.960]  that comey's been associated with and also loretta lynch and cheral mills does the tax returns
[01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:19.600]  for the clinton's comey was at hsbc where the money laundering was going on and you know to get
[01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:24.320]  your mind around this everyone you know what when you deal with massive amounts of terrorist money
[01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:29.760]  which are financing terrorists the wahhabis out of saudi arabia the muslim brotherhood of the
[01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:35.920]  middle east and we're passing money that the muslim brotherhood comes in and takes a receipt for
[01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:40.640]  in our consulate and triply we're paying the muslim brotherhood through the obama administration
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:47.120]  identified as terrorists in egypt when you see these massive amounts of money flows and also
[01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:53.840]  drugs in mexico it you know trillion dollars worth of hundred dollar bills doesn't do any good
[01:44:54.400 --> 01:45:00.640]  so the whole object is to get a compromise bank a crooked bank and hsbc paid 1.9 billion
[01:45:00.640 --> 01:45:06.080]  dollars fine that's why that's important as hsbc you're saying was then working with the globalist
[01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:11.840]  in the solid of america we blow them sky high we've cut off their money and i'm also saying
[01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:16.320]  that you don't launder money in this magnitude without the federal government knowing it without
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:21.920]  the treasury knowing it without the fd ic so they have officers in charge for that executive level
[01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:27.200]  fraud to be able to pass it through and you've got the president of the states using a uh
[01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:32.560]  you know an alias to communicate with hillary clinton over her secret server you know so you've
[01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:37.520]  got it entirely you've got collusion you've got the racketeering and if it were investigated at the
[01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:43.760]  top level and to get the records where you could prosecute people like al capone on their actual
[01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:50.000]  bank records that weren't being laundered through panaman switzerland on through shell corporations
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:53.520]  which is what the clintons have done with the clinton classic and you've exposed that it's been
[01:45:53.520 --> 01:45:57.360]  exposed by others is confirmed let me ask you this question how is it going for them it seems
[01:45:57.360 --> 01:46:01.440]  like a lot of their systems are being rolled up globally our military and intelligence agencies
[01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:05.760]  more and more and realize how much trouble we're in or exposing them it seems like they're in full
[01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:11.200]  retreat hoping to get her in and hoping then she can kind of set up some dictatorship to try to get
[01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:15.520]  out of all this well i think the clintons have you know thoughts from the beginning that they
[01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:19.680]  could fool the public one more time and we're going to have this scrutiny that they're having
[01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:25.440]  what's happening is you we saw it in the brexit vote i think you're going to see it again in the
[01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:31.680]  presidential vote for trump and that is the people are waking up and they're saying you know this
[01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:38.400]  new world order of globalism means slavery for the average person it means 90 million americans
[01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:43.200]  who could work are useless and i agree hillary literally has like 50 people at her events now
[01:46:43.200 --> 01:46:47.440]  over and over again every day she's imploded we sweet we send hidden cameras into her campaign
[01:46:47.440 --> 01:46:53.040]  headquarters uh in new york and in ohio and in florida they go no one's supporting her everyone
[01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:57.120]  we know is for trump it so obviously these polls are all fake when they say trump's neck and neck
[01:46:57.120 --> 01:47:04.160]  are losing cnn does stuff like samples 46 percent democrats to 22 percent republicans i mean this
[01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:09.440]  is ridiculous so also yeah what they do is they they over sample because do you see they're they're
[01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:16.000]  using in many of these polls the turnout assumption numbers from 2012 or 2008 well hillary clinton's
[01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:20.640]  not going to get brock obama turnout it's you know political scientists that's my point everybody
[01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:25.120]  hates her so she clearly is probably 10 points ahead what are they going to do to block the
[01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:28.880]  trump landslides the question dr coursey well there's going to try i mean i think we've got to
[01:47:28.880 --> 01:47:34.400]  keep very close to watching with this whole russian you know russia made it very clear uh saying
[01:47:34.400 --> 01:47:40.560]  directly to the obama administration keep hands off and russia will go to war if we do something
[01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:47.440]  like launch cruise missiles or to defend isis or we try to shoot down a soviet or i'm sorry a russian
[01:47:47.440 --> 01:47:54.080]  plane we do any of this type of aggressive activity russia will step it up now if that's what obama
[01:47:54.080 --> 01:47:59.440]  wants so that's the american people aren't there and we need to expose in advance but if this is
[01:47:59.440 --> 01:48:05.680]  what the clintons are down to i mean besides hillary is massively sick i mean the the indications
[01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:12.000]  that she's having epileptic like seizures and having you know being propped up with medications and
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:17.920]  you know medicated so she gets through an hour or a half long debate you know coughing constantly
[01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:24.240]  suppressing her collapse emblematic of the old bush slash clinton facade collapsing i mean we need
[01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:29.040]  to not let these people fail forward into a larger war i mean i think it's safe to say dr
[01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:32.640]  coursey the world has never been in a more dangerous position well i don't think the i don't
[01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:38.480]  think the american people already go into another you know iraq war that was you know trumped up
[01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:44.400]  and was basically but you know trump opposed it he did oppose it and you know this whole idea that
[01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:49.760]  trump was for the war because the common he made all the videos and you know we have six videos of
[01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:56.880]  him opposing it in 2004 two of them in 2013 i mean i mean 2003 what the clintons are doing is they're
[01:48:56.880 --> 01:49:01.680]  playing a game of gotcha and so are the journalists they're trying to take out of context anything
[01:49:01.680 --> 01:49:08.240]  that that you know have any issue that they can with trump to make that you know the three or
[01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:12.320]  four day news cycle sure sure exactly i mean distractions this truck says let me ask you
[01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:16.080]  this is a real expert i mean it's a real expert folks we're talking to a politically dealing with
[01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:19.920]  this what about just reaching out to liberals and going do you really want world war three
[01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:24.240]  be a really one insanity i mean come on you know you're lying you know you're just betting on this
[01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:30.320]  horse for common decency don't destroy us well you know this is where the the final contradictions
[01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:36.720]  liberals are in if they're only solution to having hillary a losing candidate a sick candidate a lying
[01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:43.360]  candidate one who nobody likes even her your supporters don't have any enthusiasm for her
[01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:48.240]  the only alternative is to go to war and this is what obama and hillary is supposedly against for
[01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:52.320]  their entire your administration by the way we're not hyping that we have the head of the army we
[01:49:52.320 --> 01:49:55.680]  have the joint chief saying we've been asked to go to war with russia trying to cause a debate
[01:49:55.680 --> 01:50:02.720]  we're at red level crazy town right now and the idea of going to war over syria the american people
[01:50:02.720 --> 01:50:08.720]  after iraq after afghanistan after the complete disorder oh yeah we can't meet the afghans
[01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:13.680]  now let's fight the russians i mean you know let's this idea we're going to fight a perpetual
[01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:20.000]  war in the middle east is not what the american people signed up for after 9 11 a limited campaign
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:27.600]  to get al-qaeda was blamed for this okay fine you know some have been modding down in afghanistan
[01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:33.280]  but now but now don't we have to stay in iraq because because isis is taking over yeah and isis
[01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:38.320]  is actually taking over iraq and and now you've got a mask i'm ready to invade right now to kick
[01:50:38.320 --> 01:50:41.760]  isis back to Saudi arabia and take their amount i'm gonna come back and ask you in a perfect
[01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:45.440]  world what should trump do if he gets elected because you know that's the big issue they're
[01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:49.600]  gonna counter strike or what happens god forbid if hillary gets in we only got six minutes left

[01:54:17.120 --> 01:54:23.280]  new book out a three-time new york times bestseller uh in in you know political books and and now
[01:54:23.280 --> 01:54:27.840]  goodnight obama goodnight moon's one of my kids favorite books they were little and it deals with
[01:54:27.840 --> 01:54:32.080]  his incredible corruption maybe liberals at their at their at their so-called intellectual level
[01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:36.880]  can understand this uh the new york times number one bestselling authors were on course the
[01:54:36.880 --> 01:54:42.240]  goodnight obama and it's a hilarious book also pretty scary but maybe this is something americans
[01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:46.880]  that don't read books anymore or think that books existing or a conspiracy theory maybe this is
[01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:50.720]  something they'll actually read let's talk about the book and then i want to ask you about
[01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:54.560]  election fraud first they said it didn't exist when i brought it up and trump brought it up
[01:54:54.560 --> 01:54:59.280]  and i asked trump to bring it up he did two days later and then they said it oh but we're coming
[01:54:59.280 --> 01:55:03.680]  into federalize the elections let's talk about that but first goodnight obama the new book by
[01:55:03.680 --> 01:55:10.400]  dr coursey and uh it's a written really is a parody and thank you alex it's um it points out
[01:55:10.400 --> 01:55:17.760]  the various things that obama has done that uh will disturb conservatives like myself increasing
[01:55:17.760 --> 01:55:24.880]  taxes um you know the all the way through the uh endorsing the muslim brotherhood you'll see the
[01:55:24.880 --> 01:55:30.320]  muslim moon and the cover you know it's basically a parody uh goodnight obama and good riddance and
[01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:37.360]  i've gone on youtube and on my twitter you'll see the um i i actually read this as a you know
[01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:43.600]  children's goodnight book uh but i think the drawings are meant to i add some humor to it but
[01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:49.280]  underlying message here is look at all the things that you know obama has done in this fundamental
[01:55:49.280 --> 01:55:54.960]  transformation of america that has sided with you know radical islam's do you say they stabilize
[01:55:54.960 --> 01:56:02.080]  the middle east doubled our national debt i mean it goes on to saying uh goodnight obama and that's
[01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:08.800]  hopefully we're you know we're done with this uh brand of a brand of anti-american socialism
[01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:14.640]  and hopefully people begin to really wake up and not be so completely especially the millennials
[01:56:14.640 --> 01:56:20.320]  to understand that they're considered by hillary clinton to be the basement dwellers and by the
[01:56:20.320 --> 01:56:23.680]  way i got the book a few days ago and nico wouldn't let me take us we either for the show but i was
[01:56:23.680 --> 01:56:28.240]  gonna take it home i'm not just saying this this book is perfect for trendies perfect for liberals
[01:56:28.240 --> 01:56:32.880]  because it really illustrates what a giant fraud all this is but it's also great for kids
[01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:37.680]  but it's great for adults a real stroke of genius well thank you i think it's going to be a good
[01:56:37.680 --> 01:56:42.720]  christmas gift i think as we actually get closer to realizing that obama's gone yeah there's his
[01:56:42.720 --> 01:56:48.880]  crocodile tears for guns you know which he does all the time and the eternal revenue service going
[01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:55.200]  after the gop uh tearing down the wall yes right he of course the wall obama wants to tear down
[01:56:55.200 --> 01:57:00.320]  is the border uh letting in you know there's the constitution and disregard for it and executive
[01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:07.040]  orders you know the book shows here you're coming off air force one with his disrespectful
[01:57:07.040 --> 01:57:11.760]  attitude towards the military problem should be a coffee cup in his hand yeah well yeah really and
[01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:17.120]  you know go ahead i ran you could have nuclear weapons and you know the the dream of hope and
[01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:23.120]  change turns into the typical socialist nightmare of you know dead imprisonment but of course
[01:57:23.120 --> 01:57:27.680]  you can go on to the talk shows and make laugh laugh about it all and you know the years
[01:57:28.400 --> 01:57:34.160]  clinging to the guns in the bible and of course obama does not understand traditional american
[01:57:34.160 --> 01:57:38.480]  values or that here's the birth certificate there's the guy who forged the birth certificate all these
[01:57:38.480 --> 01:57:42.800]  wars were fought over the second amendment they just didn't get it and you know the the fact that
[01:57:42.800 --> 01:57:47.680]  we've under the obama administration been in a perpetual war in the middle east and destabilizing
[01:57:47.680 --> 01:57:53.840]  in the middle east you know we've we've been here the movie that was blamed for Benghazi when hillary
[01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:58.320]  can't even remember the four americans were killed to Benghazi he said who was killed there i mean
[01:57:58.320 --> 01:58:03.760]  hillary's you know mental brain damage i think is and she refuses to submit to neurological
[01:58:03.760 --> 01:58:08.880]  examination people climbing into the white house which has been climbing over the fence and under
[01:58:08.880 --> 01:58:14.800]  the fence i mean the obama administration and lgbt and of course you know i'd like you alex i'm a
[01:58:14.800 --> 01:58:19.040]  libertarian but the point is point is your force feeding kids this garbage and they shouldn't be

[02:00:22.560 --> 02:00:29.040]  with dr. of course at wne.com his new book goodnight obama is powerful but when you read the book
[02:00:29.040 --> 02:00:35.200]  to your kids a thousand times literally and three kids and then it's turned into a satire it's
[02:00:35.200 --> 02:00:38.640]  it's powerful because you think of all the crimes they've committed and what they've done and you
[02:00:38.640 --> 02:00:44.000]  kind of review it in a children's book like 30 pages and it's like wow these people really are
[02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:49.680]  going out of their way they really do hate america it's like they run it they captured it it's like
[02:00:49.680 --> 02:00:54.480]  if i had some enemy that owned a hotel and then i got the hotel via a bank deal or whatever or
[02:00:54.480 --> 02:01:00.560]  default i wouldn't then blow the hotel up to piss on who had it before it's like it's real chicken
[02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:08.720]  chicken you know what behavior it's real trashy real weird unsophisticated then i ask how we
[02:01:08.720 --> 02:01:12.480]  conquered by these folks so they're talking about election fraud they got to have the feds come in the
[02:01:12.480 --> 02:01:18.240]  un come in the e you come in and monitor it but trump's crazy there's election fraud talk about
[02:01:18.240 --> 02:01:21.680]  that for one minute and then what happens if hillary gets in what happens if trump gets in
[02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:27.440]  dr. Jerome coursing well the election fraud is the real problem i mean we're finding reports
[02:01:27.440 --> 02:01:33.280]  almost every day of illegal immigrants who are registered to vote of course there's been a major
[02:01:33.280 --> 02:01:39.680]  strategy and people yeah and and you know dead people voting and and now we're gonna have the
[02:01:39.680 --> 02:01:44.000]  un come in to monitor our elections we don't need any international authorities to monitor our
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:49.600]  elections what we need is an honest election boards and we need to pass laws where people
[02:01:49.600 --> 02:01:55.440]  you know you can't put your kid in school without you know proving who you are and where you live
[02:01:55.440 --> 02:02:01.840]  well why can't we have voting registration that's dependent upon ids you know this whole democratic
[02:02:02.640 --> 02:02:07.360]  party idea the only way they can win is by cheating and stealing you know trump is gonna
[02:02:07.360 --> 02:02:12.800]  have to win by a substantial margin he's gonna have to win by an eight to ten point margin i agree
[02:02:12.800 --> 02:02:16.640]  we gotta have a landslide for a win but hypothetically if she gets in what happens she admits
[02:02:16.640 --> 02:02:21.520]  she's going after the alt media that's you and i uh what else happens well if hillary gets in you
[02:02:21.520 --> 02:02:27.760]  can forget about the first amendment because uh anybody who opposes the this totalitarian leftist
[02:02:27.760 --> 02:02:32.880]  agenda will be accused of hate speech i can forget about the second amendment she'll do away with
[02:02:32.880 --> 02:02:38.800]  the second amendment she's made that clear uh you know the expansion of the federal government the
[02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:44.640]  powers more debt more government programs more dependency on government and inevitably more
[02:02:44.640 --> 02:02:51.040]  wars because the only way that the killer clinton can sustain which he wants to do in her power grab
[02:02:51.040 --> 02:02:55.200]  will be by going that's right he doesn't want to just piss on america but russia and everybody else
[02:02:55.200 --> 02:03:02.000]  absolutely she'll go to war and you know solve and get paid more by the multinational corporations
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:07.920]  will provide the war material this is you know the the strategy of scaring people into i don't get
[02:03:07.920 --> 02:03:13.040]  these hyper dominant psychos that just won't work with people why do these crazy liberals have to
[02:03:13.040 --> 02:03:18.400]  control the language what everybody does other governments they seem like megalomaniacs dr coursey
[02:03:18.400 --> 02:03:21.840]  well they're totally opposed to what are you know the fundamental principle of our founding
[02:03:21.840 --> 02:03:27.920]  fathers which had confidence that the average person would be best to rule themselves and
[02:03:27.920 --> 02:03:33.440]  that we could have dissent because argument is the best way of reaching truth uh the left
[02:03:33.440 --> 02:03:38.640]  doesn't believe in any of this the left has an agenda and that agenda is very much like a marxist
[02:03:38.640 --> 02:03:44.240]  agenda which is unfortunate is so many of the millennials the kids in schools don't realize
[02:03:44.240 --> 02:03:48.640]  that they're the useful idiots to believe this nonsense i agree but a lot of them are going
[02:03:48.640 --> 02:03:53.040]  against hillard that's exciting in one minute left it is and they shouldn't be conditioned
[02:03:53.040 --> 02:03:58.720]  to expect free free free free free because it's not free and the point is you know that the
[02:03:59.680 --> 02:04:06.000]  the enslavement that comes from believing this leftist agenda turns immediately on those who
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:13.840]  will put them in power this is about elitism this is about elite banking you know warfare
[02:04:13.840 --> 02:04:20.640]  mentality where the clintons and their associates the sorrows is just get enormously rich and
[02:04:20.640 --> 02:04:24.960]  everybody agrees a referendum on the bush is the clintons elitism crony capitalism and the
[02:04:24.960 --> 02:04:30.560]  future trump it couldn't be clear and no more bushes no more clintons no more elites no more
[02:04:30.560 --> 02:04:35.440]  establishment back to america where it's what you produce and what you do it's actually
[02:04:35.440 --> 02:04:40.960]  fundamental principles of our country which is first amendment second amendment all the other
[02:04:40.960 --> 02:04:46.080]  that alexander to talk full wrote about it precisely and the realization that you know if
[02:04:46.080 --> 02:04:51.520]  hillary clinton wasn't on the lying agenda we wouldn't see tactics like they're being rolled out with
[02:04:51.520 --> 02:04:56.480]  kane interrupting consulate i agree please come back soon w&d.com get the new book goodbye to obama

[02:05:12.320 --> 02:05:17.440]  relationship has been in a free fall the obama administration proclaimed bilateral peace talks
[02:05:17.440 --> 02:05:23.360]  over syria are quote dead with mosco and suspended a 16 year old treaty meant to reduce the risk of
[02:05:23.360 --> 02:05:28.320]  nuclear proliferation the u.s. state department threatened russia over their actions in syria
[02:05:28.320 --> 02:05:33.600]  and according to the white house spokesperson josh earnest he said everybody's patience with russia
[02:05:33.600 --> 02:05:39.040]  has run out continuing on saying russians have been complicit in the syrian tragedy well this comes

[02:08:33.440 --> 02:08:36.960]  to me one of our great graphics people the head graphics guy and he said hey these are in the store
[02:08:36.960 --> 02:08:44.080]  now hillary for president 2016 and i went in the store and i went oh we've never sold them we were
[02:08:44.080 --> 02:08:48.480]  putting three or four in every order free and people are seeing them all over the country and i
[02:08:48.480 --> 02:08:53.840]  thought a couple weeks ago i said i want you to order an incredible amount of these i think it's
[02:08:53.840 --> 02:08:58.400]  like a million or something they went boss you really want a million of these but i don't know
[02:08:58.400 --> 02:09:01.200]  what they actually ordered because i just talked to them for like 10 seconds during the break
[02:09:01.920 --> 02:09:06.880]  but we've got hillary for president bobber stickers 10 packs at cost there's no reviews of it yet
[02:09:06.880 --> 02:09:12.960]  obviously because i just started going on spell that's 495 now i can tell you these bumper stickers
[02:09:12.960 --> 02:09:18.000]  cost us like 20 cents a piece their glossy high quality made a good petrol chemicals so they last
[02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:22.640]  a long time uh so we'll be part of the resistance in the future if she actually stills it gets in
[02:09:22.640 --> 02:09:26.720]  but let me tell you we're not making any money on that uh at that cost it didn't matter if we were
[02:09:26.720 --> 02:09:30.480]  we need the funding i think we'll make make a few bucks maybe the point is get your hillary for
[02:09:30.480 --> 02:09:36.080]  prison stickers today 10 packs but but my idea a few weeks ago i don't know they actually followed
[02:09:36.080 --> 02:09:39.200]  it they're great folks but i kind of shout orders here and there as i'm you know running down the
[02:09:39.200 --> 02:09:44.640]  hall was to have like hundred packs thousand packs at cost not just 10 packs 10 packs with
[02:09:44.640 --> 02:09:49.280]  folks who just want to do their own vehicles and give out to your employees or whatever we do well
[02:09:49.280 --> 02:09:52.800]  they did follow it okay good i forget all the stuff i've launched hillary for president bobber
[02:09:52.800 --> 02:10:00.080]  stickers 50 pack 1495 oh imagine the havoc you can have with that i know what i'm gonna be doing
[02:10:00.080 --> 02:10:06.640]  at about 6 a.m tomorrow i'm gonna go about 5 a.m take a shower where the kids have gotten up like
[02:10:06.640 --> 02:10:14.880]  like like skinny claws i'm gonna slip out the door and stick a few of these up in a few places
[02:10:14.880 --> 02:10:21.040]  and slip back in about 545 6 a.m when they wake up and cook them breakfast all the while daddy's

[02:11:43.920 --> 02:11:48.160]  you and his voice sounded so sweet i got tears of my eyes just because just to bring somebody
[02:11:48.160 --> 02:11:52.720]  happiness and people say oh you're just a dumbass all these people think they get ahead because they
[02:11:52.720 --> 02:12:02.400]  don't care about anybody you're not even human do you think you're beating us because you don't have
[02:12:02.400 --> 02:12:11.600]  any feelings that's the funniest thing i ever heard you're like cancer and you look at the body
[02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:19.760]  that gave birth to you and loved you your mother your father god this planet and you piss all over
[02:12:19.760 --> 02:12:24.400]  it like you can run around doing horrible things like you got some secret technology

[02:12:34.960 --> 02:12:39.360]  but my good side's a thousand times better than that i didn't know they could stack
[02:12:39.360 --> 02:12:45.680]  shit so high but that's what you are delay that i gotta just be honest with these people thank god
[02:12:45.680 --> 02:12:51.520]  we're not with you when i got a little endorphin rush remembering i launched this mil i think it's
[02:12:51.520 --> 02:12:57.040]  a million we printed they probably did follow my order a million bumper stickers are printed right
[02:12:57.040 --> 02:13:03.440]  now i just remembered that one million hillary for president everyone must go to info war store
[02:13:03.440 --> 02:13:07.840]  dot com and buy these i ordered them to do it at cost they're probably actuary in taxes and
[02:13:07.840 --> 02:13:11.120]  regulations and the building costs and everything because i think it's a little bit of profit in
[02:13:11.120 --> 02:13:16.320]  the numbers i saw i don't i don't think they're actually yes these are at cost at infowarstore.com
[02:13:16.320 --> 02:13:22.000]  you don't want hillary if you're in a battleground state there's 11 of them like flora and Ohio and
[02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:27.040]  pennsylvania and colorada and all you i don't care where you're at you hammer them and hammer them
[02:13:27.040 --> 02:13:31.280]  to hell post them in legal and lawful areas because when a foreign bank takes over and
[02:13:31.280 --> 02:13:34.400]  wants to murder you and your family and shut down the free press god forbid don't post these in
[02:13:34.400 --> 02:13:38.480]  public god forbid the cops ought to pack you on the back and buy a cup of coffee if they catch you
[02:13:38.480 --> 02:13:42.720]  sticking them all over power poles cops ought to be getting these sticking these up i mean what are
[02:13:42.720 --> 02:13:46.720]  you going to do to save the country we've been overrun by criminals it's time to take action
[02:13:47.600 --> 02:13:53.280]  and if tim kane looks like a potbellied pedophile then call him and say he looks like one we're sure
[02:13:53.280 --> 02:13:57.120]  he's innocent and connected to it he just wants to rape the constitution we're here to stop him
[02:13:58.720 --> 02:13:59.840]  let me just stop for just a minute
[02:13:59.840 --> 02:14:07.920]  it's gonna stop for just a moment because the the energy of good is rising let me tell you
[02:14:07.920 --> 02:14:12.320]  what's rising evil is rising and for every action is an opposite equal reaction for everything the
[02:14:12.320 --> 02:14:16.880]  enemy hits us with god's going to give us the voltage and the response and the energy and the
[02:14:16.880 --> 02:14:22.320]  discernment to beat the enemy and so it's like as evil intensifies it's like my discernment my
[02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:26.320]  understanding my energy everything gets crazier it's it you know about superheroes this is the
[02:14:26.320 --> 02:14:30.560]  real world folks fighting tyranny it's like i good god can i handle much more of this
[02:14:35.520 --> 02:14:42.080]  anyways i don't even know they have this ready i told me this morning it's hilarious i don't
[02:14:42.080 --> 02:14:47.200]  know how i i'm not even bragging we're fighting a bunch of zombies i'm out horseback riding with
[02:14:47.200 --> 02:14:52.720]  the family this weekend hunting and i say you know what this this horse looks like the horse
[02:14:52.720 --> 02:14:57.680]  putin was on a few years ago that's his most famous photo it's called this red brown horse
[02:14:58.480 --> 02:15:01.920]  and i said we ought to do a joke where you take a photo of me with my shirt off
[02:15:01.920 --> 02:15:06.720]  when we got back to the camp uh and i said i'll tweet out the first one saying i wonder why
[02:15:06.720 --> 02:15:12.320]  they say i work for putin knowing they wouldn't pick data i don't know how i know it's like
[02:15:12.320 --> 02:15:15.600]  they want to say it first but then i had to put out another one that looks even more like it
[02:15:16.720 --> 02:15:20.160]  and then saying oh he doesn't know he looks like putin look he got trolled
[02:15:20.160 --> 02:15:23.360]  when i knew it would just bring everybody back to the website see here's the deal i don't mind
[02:15:23.360 --> 02:15:27.040]  being made fun of by you that doesn't hurt me i just want folks to come to the website and hear
[02:15:27.040 --> 02:15:32.720]  the truth they think just being laughed at is so hurtful that oh look all these headlines
[02:15:32.720 --> 02:15:37.600]  alec jones puts out a picture of himself shirtless on a horse the the internet can't stop laughing
[02:15:37.600 --> 02:15:41.920]  that's what i want is the internet to not stop laughing and to come to this website and learn
[02:15:41.920 --> 02:15:46.320]  about what's really happening we have the clip of the head of the army saying get ready for world war
[02:15:46.320 --> 02:15:51.120]  two level war with russia and all the rest of it that's up on info wars dot com we have the
[02:15:51.120 --> 02:15:55.120]  actual clips of that we're going to clip together and put up for a shorter clip on youtube it'll
[02:15:55.120 --> 02:15:59.040]  be out of the article was an hour plus long speech he gave so we didn't have that earlier
[02:15:59.040 --> 02:16:03.040]  we had to clip it out but that's coming up but first since i mentioned it i want to play this
[02:16:03.040 --> 02:16:08.000]  donald trump piece where i think you should go to haydee right now and raise the fact that the
[02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:12.080]  clinton's robbed him give him a million bucks give him a bunch of food organize some charities
[02:16:12.080 --> 02:16:16.000]  that actually give the money to hastens to you know to meet with the leaders that have asked him
[02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:20.080]  to come there to expose the fact that clinton's tried to bribe him it's totally presidential he
[02:16:20.080 --> 02:16:24.000]  can then fly onto the u.s. it's going to be hit a few days later by the hurricane and it's a devastating
[02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:30.400]  victory so uh the headline uh is ladies and gentlemen donald trump to launch an emergency
[02:16:30.400 --> 02:16:35.040]  mission to haydee question mark it's up to us to lobby for him to make the right move here's that
[02:16:35.040 --> 02:16:43.360]  report devastated 2010 by one of the worst earthquakes in caribbean history it took only
[02:16:43.360 --> 02:16:48.800]  a glance to see what the reins did to the largest camp in port-of-prince estimates vary but up to
[02:16:48.800 --> 02:16:54.800]  200 000 people have lost their lives new details have a possible influence paddling in the aftermath
[02:16:54.800 --> 02:16:59.760]  of the 2010 earthquake in haydee which we all remember very well there were hundreds of home
[02:16:59.760 --> 02:17:05.600]  were destroyed after the earthquake and the people are still hungry they have no food no job no homes
[02:17:05.600 --> 02:17:12.960]  this is not right the clinton's halloween clinton should be behind bars now hurricane mathy
[02:17:12.960 --> 02:17:20.000]  has slammed into haydee and over 145 miles an hour creating unbelievable devastation the whole
[02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:28.320]  world has given billions of dollars to the clinton foundation for the Haitians not only
[02:17:28.320 --> 02:17:34.400]  not even two percent of that money went back to haydee Haitian leaders have already taken note
[02:17:34.400 --> 02:17:39.920]  of the fact that donald trump has been exposing the clinton crimes in their nation so mr trump we
[02:17:39.920 --> 02:17:48.160]  are asking you begging you the Haitian community will sign with you if one day you ask Hillary
[02:17:48.160 --> 02:17:56.080]  Clinton publicly to disclose the audit of all the money they have stolen from haydee in 2010
[02:17:56.080 --> 02:18:01.920]  after the earthquake they're calling for you donald j trump they're begging you to come to their island
[02:18:01.920 --> 02:18:10.240]  nation within somebody like that or trump in the white house to make america great so other countries
[02:18:10.240 --> 02:18:20.480]  around the world will respect america again mr trump you've been on the cutting edge of exposing
[02:18:20.480 --> 02:18:26.160]  the clinton foundation and how they robbed haydee out of all their crimes haydee is clearly the worst
[02:18:26.160 --> 02:18:35.840]  tens of millions of dollars raised and less than 10 percent actually delivered to the starving
[02:18:35.840 --> 02:18:43.920]  people of haydee more than 10 000 Haitian children then died because the united nation's effort led
[02:18:43.920 --> 02:18:51.440]  by the clintons gave them poison feted water even the state department's own data dump has letters
[02:18:51.440 --> 02:18:57.920]  from chelsea clinton the clinton's daughter saying please you've got to do a better job children
[02:18:57.920 --> 02:19:03.680]  are dying from cholera we've seen something in hillary clinton beyond hubris we've seen an almost
[02:19:03.680 --> 02:19:10.480]  mechanical disconnect a little over a month ago when she refused to go to flooded Louisiana and
[02:19:10.480 --> 02:19:16.160]  mississippi donald trump went there and was on the spot and delivered food and aid to the people
[02:19:16.160 --> 02:19:22.880]  and talked to local leaders as i speak haydee faces an even bigger threat from the devastating
[02:19:22.880 --> 02:19:30.640]  2010 earthquake hurricane matthew at over 145 miles an hour has smashed into the island and is sitting
[02:19:30.640 --> 02:19:37.920]  over it wreaking mass flooding landslides and huge amounts of death the clintons publicly led an
[02:19:37.920 --> 02:19:43.520]  international movement that in total stole close to two billion dollars of aid money that was meant
[02:19:43.520 --> 02:19:49.600]  to go to haydee and now six years later they've almost rebuilt nothing and hurricane matthew shows
[02:19:49.600 --> 02:19:56.640]  the horrific cost of what the clinton foundation has done parasitically bleeding this caribbean
[02:19:56.640 --> 02:20:04.080]  island in 2010 the president of the Haitian senate benard sanssarik was there when the clintons
[02:20:04.080 --> 02:20:10.160]  reportedly tried to bribe him to cover up the fact that they were stealing billions of dollars
[02:20:10.160 --> 02:20:15.840]  in donations in the words of the former Haitian senate president the condoms exploited haydee's
[02:20:15.840 --> 02:20:22.000]  earthquake to steal billions of dollars from the sick and starving the american embassy called me
[02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:30.160]  as it was often the case and i said president clinton has a messenger for you i said send him over
[02:20:30.800 --> 02:20:38.640]  he came did not give me his name but told me mr sanssari you joined our movement you
[02:20:38.640 --> 02:20:44.080]  signed with bill clinton and this invasion and will make you the richest man in haydee
[02:20:45.520 --> 02:20:54.000]  i said sir tell president clinton for me benard sanssari is not for sale i have principle and i
[02:20:54.000 --> 02:21:04.640]  love my country a week later by executive order clinton revoked my visa i was then a resident of
[02:21:04.640 --> 02:21:09.920]  the united state i am now a citizen of the united state and you know when she raises this money every
[02:21:09.920 --> 02:21:15.120]  time she raises money she's making deals to say could i be the ambassador to this could i do that
[02:21:15.120 --> 02:21:19.600]  make sure my business is taken care of i mean give me a break all of the money she's raising
[02:21:19.600 --> 02:21:24.800]  that's blood money i'll be honest with viewers donald trump has always been one step ahead of me
[02:21:24.800 --> 02:21:29.680]  and my listeners that's why he needs to be our president but i'm just here to give the moral
[02:21:29.680 --> 02:21:34.880]  support to make sure that donald does what he knows his best and some of his advisors don't
[02:21:34.880 --> 02:21:39.760]  block this idea because it's the right thing to do to help haydee the clintons have already robbed
[02:21:39.760 --> 02:21:45.280]  them of billions of dollars of donations and it shows that america really does care and it shows
[02:21:45.280 --> 02:21:50.720]  how presidential donald trump is to fly in not days after the hurricane but right behind it as it
[02:21:50.720 --> 02:21:57.120]  blows out tomorrow come in land give them a donation give them food rally good aid organizations
[02:21:57.120 --> 02:22:03.120]  that have good ratings online forgiving almost all the donations to the Haitians and support a true
[02:22:03.120 --> 02:22:08.720]  rebuilding in that country and announce that your organization the trump organization is going to
[02:22:08.720 --> 02:22:15.440]  investigate building a hotel or tourist attraction in the nation show people what you've done in the
[02:22:15.440 --> 02:22:22.240]  business world show people true business investment in haydee and a true helping hand in the midst of
[02:22:22.240 --> 02:22:28.000]  their crisis then hillary will counter saying you should be in the us not in haydee once you've shown
[02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:32.640]  a spotlight on what's happening on haydee and gotten the people of the world to pour out billions
[02:22:32.640 --> 02:22:38.000]  of dollars that i predict will come in the next week with your leadership you will then be able
[02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:42.720]  to move on to the united states and help with the damage that's taken place from the hurricane that
[02:22:42.720 --> 02:22:49.280]  hits the east coast in my view and from my gut this is the right thing to do because haydee has
[02:22:49.280 --> 02:22:54.320]  been absolutely used and abused by the clinton's it's an international scandal it's something that
[02:22:54.320 --> 02:23:00.880]  will really wake up the voters how cold-blooded this clinton crime family is and it'll bring real aid
[02:23:00.880 --> 02:23:07.280]  to the Haitians and you'll be able to expose the crimes they've committed while making right what's
[02:23:07.280 --> 02:23:15.120]  happened to the Haitian people this is such a no-brainer and i guarantee you folks donald trump
[02:23:15.120 --> 02:23:19.280]  was thinking about it before we were but we've got to make sure via twitter and via facebook
[02:23:19.280 --> 02:23:23.760]  and other platforms that he knows this is the right move to make you know he's going to be on the
[02:23:23.760 --> 02:23:28.320]  east coast when it's hit by the hurricane while obama's playing golf and hillary's taking a nap
[02:23:28.320 --> 02:23:34.320]  but he needs to go to haydee because they've been so screwed over by the woman he's running against
[02:23:34.320 --> 02:23:40.560]  hillary rottem clinton in closing some of the best special forces in the world are sas in britain
[02:23:40.560 --> 02:23:47.760]  and their maxim is fortune favors the bold well our fortune is building a great economy turning
[02:23:47.760 --> 02:23:53.840]  loose the engine of liberty and empowering humanity something we know donald j trump believes in
[02:23:53.840 --> 02:24:00.400]  deeply there's another maxim and that comes from our own army and that is in latin liberate the
[02:24:00.400 --> 02:24:05.040]  oppressed from the green berets donald trump and the liberty movement is all about liberating the
[02:24:05.040 --> 02:24:11.520]  oppressed and of the people of haydee aren't oppressed nobody is they are oppressed by the clintons
[02:24:11.520 --> 02:24:16.960]  and limousine liberals and donald trump needs to come and begin the process of freeing the
[02:24:16.960 --> 02:24:23.520]  Haitians and rebuilding haydee america led by the clintons screwed over the Haitians it's time for
[02:24:23.520 --> 02:24:29.840]  donald trump to reverse that i'm alex jones signing off rimfullwars.com if you're watching
[02:24:29.840 --> 02:24:37.520]  this transmission you are the resistance all right i saw that report last night it's on info
[02:24:37.520 --> 02:24:44.640]  wars.com red link please send it to twitter to donald trump facebook the media uh he's already
[02:24:44.640 --> 02:24:50.320]  made some great moves one of mexico going to louisiana there's no hurricane there now he's
[02:24:50.320 --> 02:24:54.480]  got to get down there give him a donation give him some food bring some charity leaders with him that
[02:24:54.480 --> 02:25:00.080]  can meet him organize folks to hey give money not to the clintons but directly to these groups
[02:25:00.080 --> 02:25:04.480]  you know this group is 90 percent this group is 89 percent you know but charities keep it like
[02:25:04.480 --> 02:25:08.960]  10 percent that's what it takes to run stuff on average so if something's given 89 90 percent you
[02:25:08.960 --> 02:25:15.360]  know it's good water treatment schooling food you name it medicine um again i've had family that's
[02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:20.000]  gone to haydee gone to south america you name it to help folks ran paul this credit's been to haydee
[02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:25.680]  amongst doing it gary haven's taken him some of the times and it's just a good thing to go help
[02:25:25.680 --> 02:25:28.800]  people i mean that's what you're supposed to do it's not like oh it's special i wouldn't help
[02:25:28.800 --> 02:25:34.240]  somebody that's what humans do i mean if i'm in trouble i want to help we came home one time from
[02:25:34.240 --> 02:25:40.240]  a christmas trip out west camping and uh from new mexico and the pipes had burst in the ceiling and
[02:25:40.240 --> 02:25:45.520]  actually caved in there was even i don't know how it did it was like a hole in the roof it was like
[02:25:45.520 --> 02:25:50.480]  in my bedroom it was like open to the sky because they workers had torn in to cut the water off and
[02:25:50.480 --> 02:25:53.520]  you know we hadn't stayed our neighbors for a couple days i mean that's what this is all about
[02:25:54.160 --> 02:25:57.920]  we could stay at a hotel the next one ever said hey we got extra bedroom or two you'll stay right here
[02:26:00.240 --> 02:26:03.520]  bottom line history is happening right now and
[02:26:07.120 --> 02:26:10.560]  all of us seem to do everything we can the next 33 days or 32 and a half days now
[02:26:10.560 --> 02:26:15.040]  to expose the globalist i'm going to cut videos that chronicle the clinton's crimes
[02:26:16.240 --> 02:26:20.560]  that's up to you to get those out to everybody i'm going to cut videos exposing the islamic attacks
[02:26:20.560 --> 02:26:25.200]  on women we're going to expose what happened in haiti we're going to obviously interview some
[02:26:25.200 --> 02:26:28.880]  people abused by clinton personally here in studio next week i'm going to leave it at that
[02:26:29.760 --> 02:26:34.320]  we're just pulling all the stops right now because history is happening this this election counts
[02:26:34.320 --> 02:26:40.880]  it's not where you got two two stage presidents or two two stage candidates it's happening now
[02:26:40.880 --> 02:26:46.240]  since i mentioned this last hour this was an hour long plus video in army times we wrote about it
[02:26:46.240 --> 02:26:50.320]  us army chief threatens war with russia we will beat you harder than you've ever been
[02:26:50.320 --> 02:26:56.000]  beaten before he tells the russians then he goes into iran who our own government's actually
[02:26:56.000 --> 02:27:01.920]  arming not russia and then he goes on to say this could be uh nothing like we've experienced since
[02:27:01.920 --> 02:27:07.760]  world war two and you tie us into the chairman of the joint chiefs dumford two weeks ago or almost
[02:27:07.760 --> 02:27:11.600]  two weeks ago saying we're getting ready for world war three with russia this is what they've been
[02:27:11.600 --> 02:27:16.080]  told to get ready for and you got weirdos in congress the democrats are hoping it's going
[02:27:16.080 --> 02:27:20.960]  can't you just shoot down those russian airplanes with cruise missiles not have our guys hurt now
[02:27:20.960 --> 02:27:28.400]  imagine they're thinking now now now these congressmen listen carefully are dumb they're idiots
[02:27:28.400 --> 02:27:31.920]  they're fools they're jokes they're morons they probably think they're real smart
[02:27:34.480 --> 02:27:38.320]  but remember the congressman who's still the congressman in georgia in atlanta
[02:27:39.120 --> 02:27:44.800]  he thinks that guam our main military base in the pacific one of the main ones for b52 as you
[02:27:44.800 --> 02:27:52.000]  name it he thinks that it's floating that islands float that rocks float like hawaii's floating
[02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:59.120]  not mountains that stick up out of the water from tectonic plate action he doesn't know any of that
[02:27:59.120 --> 02:28:04.640]  he doesn't know how fun it is to know all that he thinks it's floating islands he was asked because
[02:28:04.640 --> 02:28:09.200]  he believes they're islands because he can see them above the water the guy has probably a 70 iq
[02:28:09.200 --> 02:28:15.920]  he's mentally retarded in my view i'm sad for him but it's only one step beyond that to have
[02:28:15.920 --> 02:28:19.920]  republican democratic congressman that i have on tape it's like an hour long briefing with the with
[02:28:19.920 --> 02:28:24.480]  the chairman where they're going can't you listen we don't have to have war we just shoot cruise
[02:28:24.480 --> 02:28:29.280]  missiles in they shoot down the russian planes and the generals keep going but then the russians
[02:28:29.280 --> 02:28:34.160]  respond see they think as you send a cruise missile it's not human when it kills humans
[02:28:34.800 --> 02:28:40.560]  the russians don't respond and the general in the full hour long exchange keeps going to
[02:28:40.560 --> 02:28:44.880]  democrats republicans we ought to play the whole thing tomorrow just over several hours keeps going
[02:28:44.880 --> 02:28:49.200]  well there'll be russian pilots and they'll respond they keep going but we're gonna fire
[02:28:49.200 --> 02:28:54.800]  cruise missiles so we don't lose people he goes but they'll then respond they i mean i knew more
[02:28:54.800 --> 02:29:02.400]  when i was 12 about military operations than these congressmen did and i guess because genetically i
[02:29:02.400 --> 02:29:08.880]  was like a warrior ant or a leader ant whatever you want to call it i was attracted to it and
[02:29:08.880 --> 02:29:13.120]  reading every book i could on it about bombing runs in europe and i guess both grandfathers had
[02:29:13.120 --> 02:29:17.200]  genetically done that so maybe it was like an ancestral memory that was so close it was passed
[02:29:17.200 --> 02:29:21.760]  on to me but i was obsessed with aerial warfare and ships and bombs and weapons and detonators
[02:29:21.760 --> 02:29:26.560]  and atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons and fission fusion and particle beams and you know
[02:29:26.560 --> 02:29:30.240]  everything else i wanted to know about intelligence agencies and secret societies and everything else
[02:29:30.240 --> 02:29:33.520]  and then you sit there you think congress knows they're like well why can't we just
[02:29:35.280 --> 02:29:39.200]  why can't we just blow up the russians they're like they'll respond they don't even understand
[02:29:39.200 --> 02:29:44.000]  the generals keep going we'll go to war if you do that that's how crazy i'm gonna play these clips
[02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:48.560]  we have the new us army chief threatens war with russia when we come up and then we're going to go
[02:29:48.560 --> 02:29:57.360]  to roger stone stay with us we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio

[02:33:12.960 --> 02:33:19.600]  the truth is humanity is coming down fast but we're miles above them on our journey to hell
[02:33:19.600 --> 02:33:30.800]  it's time to reverse that journey to hell roger stone's gonna be popping in here in a moment
[02:33:30.800 --> 02:33:35.120]  we're getting them on the line right now but there is an hour plus speech given yesterday
[02:33:35.120 --> 02:33:42.480]  by the head of the u.s. army chief of staff mark uh milley and that dub tells with dumford the
[02:33:42.480 --> 02:33:46.400]  chairman of the joint chief saying you're asking us to go to war with russia we will launch cruise
[02:33:46.400 --> 02:33:51.280]  missiles they will shoot down russian aircraft they will attack and congress goes but our pilots
[02:33:51.280 --> 02:33:58.000]  won't get hurt and they go yes but then our aircraft carriers will i mean this is like the
[02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:02.800]  congressman from georgia thinking islands float i mean i am horrified i used to always hear by
[02:34:02.800 --> 02:34:07.920]  people alexis not a conspiracy it's idiots in government well it's idiots with a conspiracy
[02:34:07.920 --> 02:34:13.200]  it's both uh this is an incredibly dangerous time here is the piece we went and excised out the
[02:34:13.200 --> 02:34:18.880]  clips of the chief of staff the article is up on info wars dot com u.s. army chief threatens war
[02:34:18.880 --> 02:34:26.240]  with russia here it is i want to be clear to those who try to oppose the united states
[02:34:27.680 --> 02:34:34.480]  i want to be clear to those who wish to do us harm i want to be clear to those around the world
[02:34:35.520 --> 02:34:39.680]  want to destroy our way of life you mean the glow of our allies and friends you'll blow
[02:34:39.680 --> 02:34:45.680]  the planet up your lives in the united states military despite all our challenges despite
[02:34:45.680 --> 02:34:53.040]  our op tempo despite everything we've been doing will stop you and we will beat you harder than
[02:34:53.040 --> 02:34:59.440]  you've ever been beaten before make no mistake about that other countries russia china rand
[02:34:59.440 --> 02:35:05.360]  and north korea went to school on us they closely watched how we fought in 91 and 03
[02:35:05.360 --> 02:35:10.560]  they studied our doctrine our tactics our equipment our organization our training and
[02:35:10.560 --> 02:35:16.720]  our leadership and in turn they revised their own doctrines and they are rapidly modernizing
[02:35:16.720 --> 02:35:23.600]  the military today to avoid our strengths in hopes of defeating us at some point in the future
[02:35:24.480 --> 02:35:30.320]  recently a senior russian official ambassador to the united kingdom alexander katamenko
[02:35:30.320 --> 02:35:36.320]  he said quote the established world order is undergoing a foundational shakeup
[02:35:36.880 --> 02:35:44.240]  with the Crimea ukraine and brexit he went on to call for the dismantling of nato and the european
[02:35:44.240 --> 02:35:51.920]  union and he said quote russia can now fight a conventional war in europe and win russia is the
[02:35:51.920 --> 02:35:57.920]  only country that will remain relevant forever any other country is dispensable and that includes
[02:35:57.920 --> 02:36:05.920]  the united states we are in game now end quote we can now and we will remain in the future
[02:36:07.040 --> 02:36:14.400]  retain the capability to rapidly to deploy and and we will destroy any enemy anywhere
[02:36:15.040 --> 02:36:21.360]  anytime additionally the battlefield will be highly complex almost certainly in dense urban
[02:36:21.360 --> 02:36:28.080]  areas and against an elusive ambiguous enemy that combines terrorism and guerrilla warfare
[02:36:28.080 --> 02:36:34.320]  alongside conventional capabilities mixed with large civilian populations and again we're facing
[02:36:34.320 --> 02:36:38.800]  the biggest threat since world war two is the other quote general mark milley has been ordered
[02:36:38.800 --> 02:36:43.280]  to do this the threat is the new world order the threat is george soros the threat are the people
[02:36:43.280 --> 02:36:47.360]  spending hundreds of millions to have cops killed the threat of people that opened our borders
[02:36:47.360 --> 02:36:53.520]  have sold our jobs overseas and want to collapse russia like they've collapsed us but he's been
[02:36:53.520 --> 02:37:01.520]  ordered to do this he's been ordered to put this out and when russia has said you read the full
[02:37:01.520 --> 02:37:05.280]  quote is they're in the end game because they know they're under attack or having drills they're
[02:37:05.280 --> 02:37:10.240]  preparing for nuclear war the average american is running around trying to get transgendered bathrooms
[02:37:10.240 --> 02:37:19.040]  put in but he's been milley was ordered to to do that just like the chairman was ordered to do it
[02:37:19.040 --> 02:37:24.080]  two weeks ago because that could be their october surprise is war with russia and then that makes
[02:37:24.080 --> 02:37:29.120]  sense accusing trump roger stone alex jones everybody being a russian agent nope i mean
[02:37:29.120 --> 02:37:36.640]  ridiculous but you see then you start a war oh then we got to arrest our opposition those evil
[02:37:36.640 --> 02:37:41.360]  folks that are pro-gun those evil folks that are anti radical islam those folks that are pro-family
[02:37:41.360 --> 02:37:47.680]  those people that want lower taxes they're russian agents meanwhile a bunch of neo-controskeites that
[02:37:47.680 --> 02:37:53.040]  are literally former russian agents are who run the republican party that is against donald trump
[02:37:53.040 --> 02:37:57.120]  let's play this clip from uh the chairman of the joint chiefs just in case you just tuned in
[02:37:57.120 --> 02:38:01.120]  you got hillary saying if there's any cyber attacks they say are from russia launch a physical war
[02:38:01.120 --> 02:38:08.000]  against russia that's the hour we're in folks here it is for syria what about the option of
[02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:15.200]  controlling the air so that that barrel bombs cannot be dropped all all the options uh what do
[02:38:15.200 --> 02:38:21.600]  you think of that option sir right now senator for us to control all of the airspace in syria
[02:38:21.600 --> 02:38:30.480]  would require us to go to war against syria and russia that's a pretty fundamental decision that
[02:38:30.480 --> 02:38:34.160]  certainly i'm not going to make all right let me explain what's happening here and i'm going to
[02:38:34.160 --> 02:38:39.520]  roger stone to cover other issues he can comment on this if he wants to let's say russia has an
[02:38:39.520 --> 02:38:47.680]  elephant gun a 50 caliber rifle to our head and general dumpford and general miley have a
[02:38:49.760 --> 02:38:56.000]  50 millimeter howitzer pointed at our head yes the russian head is going to be more blown off
[02:38:56.000 --> 02:39:01.360]  than ours but our heads going to be blown off as well the russians can only destroy the planet
[02:39:01.360 --> 02:39:06.960]  some estimates from jane's weapons quarterly are a hundred times the us 200 300 times and we all
[02:39:06.960 --> 02:39:10.960]  know there's a lot of secret weapons that have been developed the russians have too but let's just
[02:39:10.960 --> 02:39:18.160]  be honest the u.s. is got got a lot of brains russia does too but the u.s. is is sickeningly uh
[02:39:18.160 --> 02:39:27.280]  providence prone okay so this is crazy town it's like saying i've i've put a hundred gallons of
[02:39:27.280 --> 02:39:33.200]  gasoline in your house we go oh yeah russia we've put 500 gallons in your house well i'll just
[02:39:33.200 --> 02:39:38.160]  white it i'll light it too okay flames will be higher in the russian house than here our houses
[02:39:38.160 --> 02:39:45.520]  will be burned to the ground and why russia isn't doing anything to us and for that i'm accused of
[02:39:45.520 --> 02:39:50.160]  being a russian agent uh roger stone i've done him for i'm betting like six seven years ago in
[02:39:50.160 --> 02:39:55.360]  dallas at a jfk event he's the best-selling author on the jfk assassination but you know
[02:39:55.360 --> 02:39:59.440]  but been in like inside four or five administrations worked for i've been involved in nine different
[02:39:59.440 --> 02:40:03.760]  campaigns or eight campaigns everything he's ever told me he's been incredibly accurate in fact
[02:40:03.760 --> 02:40:09.600]  scarily so but i had other sources and i saw wiki leaks out saying she'll be destroyed she's going to
[02:40:09.600 --> 02:40:14.640]  be indicted this will get her indicted just two weeks ago he cancels this event he goes out he
[02:40:14.640 --> 02:40:20.240]  does this other access tv style deal from germany and then never releases anything i got a little mad
[02:40:20.240 --> 02:40:23.680]  but you know saudi's done a great job overall so i'll give him a pass i apologize for being too
[02:40:23.680 --> 02:40:28.720]  angry in the middle of the night you know being up 20 hours but that said now you're now saying
[02:40:28.720 --> 02:40:31.760]  i have the clip coming up let's cue that up it's about a minute long after we talked to stone
[02:40:31.760 --> 02:40:35.120]  that they are going to release it quote the next few days his his lawyer said that
[02:40:35.120 --> 02:40:41.280]  on al zezero but that's separately we already have all these huge october surprise the vengazi
[02:40:41.280 --> 02:40:47.280]  stand down uh all the corruption the foundation the emails i mean pretty much what would bring her
[02:40:47.280 --> 02:40:51.200]  down you know the sky's the limit but roger sent me an email earlier the morning said
[02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:55.840]  it was like six a.m i already gone to bed for a few hours he's like well i'll take the blame i've
[02:40:55.840 --> 02:41:00.000]  never been like been given such dis info before directly by my intermediary to him but i said
[02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:05.200]  you don't take the blame you're a credible guy i get stiffed by sources too uh you know we know
[02:41:05.200 --> 02:41:08.720]  what hillard has really done he's the one that advertised all this you're more credible than
[02:41:08.720 --> 02:41:14.560]  ever we're the men in the arena so we come up short sometime i noticed they had like
[02:41:14.560 --> 02:41:19.360]  right wing watch and media matters and everything and having to post make fun of me oh alex said
[02:41:19.360 --> 02:41:24.400]  he's proud he did that show the other night and was chumped yeah we had millions of viewers online
[02:41:24.400 --> 02:41:29.360]  alone grew our audience hugely we're at hundreds of newspapers yesterday exposed to globalists
[02:41:29.360 --> 02:41:34.080]  brought up the clinton's crimes while millions tuned in our link was the top link on the internet
[02:41:34.080 --> 02:41:40.640]  for the wiki links feed yes i succeeded by showing up in that game and getting run over
[02:41:40.640 --> 02:41:45.440]  that's what a player does dumbasses and all you people that aren't in the arena don't get that
[02:41:45.440 --> 02:41:50.320]  roger stone the man in the arena you're on the air alex great to be back with you you know it's
[02:41:50.320 --> 02:41:56.880]  not over till it's over uh and if one looks at the ap story on what a sign says uh he's going to
[02:41:56.880 --> 02:42:02.720]  release documents for the next 10 weeks and they are going to specifically address war
[02:42:02.720 --> 02:42:10.480]  or immigration google and what's going on there in the u.s. election so um i don't think anything
[02:42:10.480 --> 02:42:17.920]  has changed in this case justice delayed is not justice denied uh no one ever suggested that alex
[02:42:17.920 --> 02:42:24.640]  jones or particularly roger stone controls julie massage we just admire him uh but he's
[02:42:24.640 --> 02:42:31.520]  going to inform the american people evidently on a time frame of his choosing uh he's not for
[02:42:31.520 --> 02:42:36.400]  dylan trump he's not a republican no he's been very very bipartisan and and and look
[02:42:36.400 --> 02:42:42.400]  you know he uh again i got angry i've apologized overall his work's so great i just didn't like
[02:42:42.400 --> 02:42:46.640]  sitting there hearing him say you know he said i'm gonna she'll be indicted when i release this
[02:42:46.640 --> 02:42:50.640]  and then it didn't get released but but i talked to some sources correct am i wrong to say he was
[02:42:50.640 --> 02:42:55.920]  actually threatened that you'll never get a deal of you do this well not only that he is uh they
[02:42:55.920 --> 02:43:01.120]  have these trumped up charges against him on sexual assault which i'm convinced is a complete frame
[02:43:01.120 --> 02:43:06.720]  yeah he you know they admit two women consensual manajato then weeks later they bitch and one of
[02:43:06.720 --> 02:43:11.520]  them has been connected to the central intelligence agency right and i know alex you're you're personally
[02:43:11.520 --> 02:43:18.720]  jealous about the two girls so it is it is uh uh it's laughable it's it's a joke uh because it's
[02:43:18.720 --> 02:43:24.720]  a frame and you can see that they want to lock this guy up so that he cannot expose the deep front
[02:43:24.720 --> 02:43:32.320]  the deep state but uh nothing's really changed i'm still highly confident uh that he is uh going to
[02:43:32.320 --> 02:43:38.960]  do what he has said he is going to do perhaps it won't happen in the time frame that i uh had been
[02:43:38.960 --> 02:43:43.040]  made aware of but i still have confidence and let's be clear though now that i know the inside
[02:43:43.040 --> 02:43:47.360]  baseball he didn't jump you or anybody he was going to do it everything you said fall with
[02:43:47.360 --> 02:43:51.360]  their tracking he got some incredible threats correct me if i'm wrong but i have this from
[02:43:51.360 --> 02:43:57.840]  another source from lawyers in new york that's when he backed off now he's had sarah harris
[02:43:57.840 --> 02:44:01.920]  want to play this clip yesterday on algae zero this has gotten no coverage it's on info wars.com
[02:44:01.920 --> 02:44:07.680]  said it will be in the next few days here it is a press conference uh sarah harris and we were we
[02:44:07.680 --> 02:44:12.720]  were told by julie and assange that more more leaks were coming more more damaging information
[02:44:12.720 --> 02:44:18.800]  was coming um he mentioned uh hillary clinton what what what can we expect from that over the next
[02:44:18.800 --> 02:44:27.440]  few days? yeah well as julie and was explaining this morning we will be starting uh some more
[02:44:27.440 --> 02:44:34.000]  public that will be running uh with publications happening every few days they'll be starting
[02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:42.560]  in a few days um and we have uh several of them with a number of uh interesting revelations that
[02:44:42.560 --> 02:44:47.680]  will be coming out uh to do with yes as you just pointed out what's interesting about them but also
[02:44:47.680 --> 02:44:53.360]  in another number of other topics um well i'm afraid on that what i'm going to annoy you and
[02:44:53.360 --> 02:44:58.160]  you're going to have to wait uh i i that's it i heard it was an editor who's also a lawyer on
[02:44:58.160 --> 02:45:03.600]  the same show saying some more things so so stone that's good news uh we want to see quote the
[02:45:03.600 --> 02:45:09.200]  information that will indict her if he has knowledge of a crime he needs to release it well uh
[02:45:09.200 --> 02:45:13.360]  reading from the associated press the science says that we could leak plans to start publishing
[02:45:13.360 --> 02:45:19.600]  new material starting this week meaning next week the significant material would address war
[02:45:19.600 --> 02:45:29.040]  arms oil internet giant google the us election and mass surveillance yes i think that this payload
[02:45:29.040 --> 02:45:36.640]  is coming uh and the deep state is quaking in their boots now you can't really blame a son
[02:45:36.640 --> 02:45:42.960]  she doesn't want to end up like seth rich who took three in the back and in fact it's funny
[02:45:42.960 --> 02:45:47.280]  it shows you may have the same sources he was told hey seth rich got three or four bullets in the
[02:45:47.280 --> 02:45:52.800]  back you better shut up yeah i mean and we now know that hillary clinton actually considered
[02:45:52.800 --> 02:46:00.160]  using a drone to take him out we they've had security problems there at the equatorial embassy
[02:46:00.160 --> 02:46:05.120]  the globalists want this guy dead and quickly because he can connect the dots and i suspect
[02:46:05.120 --> 02:46:11.920]  they know he can connect the dots and that is deeply problematic for the you know the bushes
[02:46:11.920 --> 02:46:16.400]  and the clintons and others who have been uh profiteering off the system while they sell out
[02:46:16.400 --> 02:46:20.960]  their country and they thought they're gonna say what's fine on us and now spies on them
[02:46:20.960 --> 02:46:27.440]  shifting gears out of this then what do you make of all the war with russia talk is that hillary's
[02:46:27.440 --> 02:46:33.600]  october surprise well it could be out look i've said all along that the whole idea of her raising
[02:46:33.600 --> 02:46:38.880]  the question of trump's coziness with russia a completely phony issue eric trump today saying
[02:46:38.880 --> 02:46:45.440]  we have no investments or loans whatsoever uh in russia so that turns out to be an entire
[02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:52.640]  canard no i think the neocons around hillary are committed to war it is the policies of the obama
[02:46:52.640 --> 02:46:59.280]  clinton administration that have moved us towards war trump is the peace candidate trump favors
[02:46:59.280 --> 02:47:04.880]  detente with the russians uh he understands how do we reach out to liberals and say your your party
[02:47:04.880 --> 02:47:11.600]  is a warmongering psycho group now it's it's really it is everything is kind of backwards it's upside
[02:47:11.600 --> 02:47:18.400]  down very very uh you know kafka ask your you're looking down the rabbit hole now um you know we
[02:47:18.400 --> 02:47:24.720]  are the ones who are soft on the russians which is nonsense and the democrats are the hardliners
[02:47:24.720 --> 02:47:29.840]  i mean it's uh everything here is is bashed up on the russians we're not going to let them take
[02:47:29.840 --> 02:47:34.480]  over or push us around but we're we are against nuclear war on the end of the planet well i think
[02:47:34.480 --> 02:47:40.240]  so and i think so are so are they and more importantly we have a common enemy in ices who
[02:47:40.240 --> 02:47:45.120]  is a greater threat to both of us at the moment it would probably be a good thing if we could get
[02:47:45.120 --> 02:47:51.040]  together and coordinate our efforts to destroy them uh then yesterday just proving this whole
[02:47:51.680 --> 02:47:57.520]  this whole continuing drama i learned with a certainty that jerry nadleyer congressman jerry
[02:47:57.520 --> 02:48:04.800]  nadleyer from uh new york job of the hot sun spearhead spearhead of the effort to uh get the fbi
[02:48:04.800 --> 02:48:12.800]  director to investigate yours truly uh for my non-existent uh ties to the russians and the
[02:48:12.800 --> 02:48:19.120]  supposition that the foreign agent stone is talking to the foreign agent asansh well i've
[02:48:19.120 --> 02:48:24.400]  never said that he's not a foreign agent i'm not a foreign agent uh this is this is a witch hunt
[02:48:24.400 --> 02:48:30.320]  that joe mccarthy would be proud of but nadler now admits the questions were fed to him by the money
[02:48:30.320 --> 02:48:38.320]  launderer david rock the uh the incredibly short uh and nasty hitman for the clinton's who by the way
[02:48:38.320 --> 02:48:45.200]  whose book the education of hillary rottam uh you know is a foundation for my book he confirms
[02:48:45.200 --> 02:48:49.360]  actually he wrote it before i did all of the criminal activities of hillary clinton and
[02:48:49.360 --> 02:48:57.280]  silencing bills sexual assault victims a book he has never disavowed why do you switch sides
[02:48:58.240 --> 02:49:05.280]  cash cold cash he's a mercenary and uh he wasn't making enough money on the right meanwhile you have
[02:49:05.280 --> 02:49:12.240]  the hijacking of the conservative media we now know that fox news as you pointed out
[02:49:12.240 --> 02:49:20.080]  the brit you met fox news got busted yesterday using word for word verbatim uh media matters for
[02:49:20.080 --> 02:49:25.520]  america talking points newsmax once a reliable conservative organ has been hijacked by the
[02:49:25.520 --> 02:49:31.920]  clinton's the owner of new tax chris ruddy is given 1.5 million dollars to the clinton foundation
[02:49:31.920 --> 02:49:37.440]  this is the guy who wrote the the definitive best book on this why did he do that because he knows
[02:49:37.440 --> 02:49:40.400]  that clinton's are going to have scored sure that shut down all of their media is that why
[02:49:40.400 --> 02:49:44.640]  beck is groveling is that why beck is groveling is why beck is groveling because they know it's
[02:49:44.640 --> 02:49:50.480]  the end game no in this particular case uh there was an email released by a sign last week that
[02:49:50.480 --> 02:49:57.680]  shows that ruddy appealed to the clinton's um to get a visa for a young man who's a friend of his
[02:49:57.680 --> 02:50:03.120]  and pay them out to come and stay in the united states so its pay for play is what it appears to
[02:50:03.120 --> 02:50:09.040]  be but people need to know newsmax was once a conservative organ it's now controlled by the
[02:50:09.040 --> 02:50:14.000]  clinton's if that's where you're getting your news folks switch to info wars dot com because
[02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:19.520]  newsmax is no longer run by conservatives just like fox news is no longer run by conservatives
[02:50:19.520 --> 02:50:25.280]  these are now clinton house organs oh i mean they'll have a show where it's the host and then a
[02:50:25.280 --> 02:50:30.240]  republican democrat and the republican democrat guest will go oh it's ridiculous hillary only

[02:54:26.560 --> 02:54:31.760]  least be alive i've been asking a lot of questions here roger stone what about the polls what about
[02:54:31.760 --> 02:54:37.920]  the numbers what about hillary what about the debate last night i mean wow uh did governor
[02:54:37.920 --> 02:54:45.840]  pennstown absolutely annihilate creepy cane uh cane is burning down it seems like i think
[02:54:45.840 --> 02:54:51.760]  mike penns did a fantastic job last night and uh i was very proud you know i've offered to step in
[02:54:51.760 --> 02:54:57.200]  as his body double at any time but last night i'm glad i i didn't because he was terrific
[02:54:58.080 --> 02:55:04.800]  measured balanced comment and he was up against a rude arrogant jerk i mean the likeability
[02:55:04.800 --> 02:55:10.560]  factor in american politics is crucial i mean constantly being interrupted but just creepy i
[02:55:10.560 --> 02:55:15.520]  mean the guy live somebody on a radio show is on this morning said he looked like a child molester
[02:55:15.520 --> 02:55:22.160]  i mean the guy was sweating nasty this is the guy who would be working republicans in congress
[02:55:22.160 --> 02:55:27.600]  is sitting vice president uh and of course the juxtaposition of the cane record in virginia
[02:55:27.600 --> 02:55:34.400]  a disaster and pennsy's record uh in in indiana a model in terms of productivity and growth
[02:55:35.360 --> 02:55:42.240]  and uh economic prosperity uh it is is uh striking so i would just remember remind
[02:55:42.240 --> 02:55:48.880]  some folks that it was paul maniforte who strongly urged the selection of mike penns who arranged for
[02:55:48.880 --> 02:55:54.400]  trump to meet penns that others in the camp at that point lewandaus do you want it
[02:55:54.960 --> 02:55:59.600]  chris christy think how that would have worked out he's uh two steps away from impeachment now
[02:55:59.600 --> 02:56:05.040]  that we've determined in the federal courts that he lied entirely about the george washington bridge
[02:56:05.040 --> 02:56:08.800]  covering uh closing sure i mean getting off chris you want to be clear because there was some cross
[02:56:08.800 --> 02:56:13.200]  talking my ear i mean i'm not saying kane is a child molester but he's called creepy kane trump
[02:56:13.200 --> 02:56:18.640]  says he looks like a you know you know absolute kook criminal like both the actual tweet uh but i
[02:56:18.640 --> 02:56:23.040]  heard you said something about child molester well i said was i did a radio show this morning and a
[02:56:23.040 --> 02:56:28.160]  woman called in and said he looked like a child molester i'm not saying you didn't know that in
[02:56:28.160 --> 02:56:34.320]  the first hour i said he looked like a child molester wow i did not so uh so it is obviously uh
[02:56:34.320 --> 02:56:38.800]  people uh did not react well to the whole way he came across yeah when people think you look like
[02:56:38.800 --> 02:56:42.640]  a child molester you're not doing too good yeah i would say generally speaking we're not saying
[02:56:42.640 --> 02:56:47.680]  he molest uh molest children we're not saying that everybody knows catty shack is a little judge
[02:56:47.680 --> 02:56:53.760]  smells the less collies to see newt gingrich who i thought he was on the trump team but he's out

[03:01:02.080 --> 03:01:06.720]  what do you expect to see in the second presidential debate between donald j trump and hillary the
[03:01:06.720 --> 03:01:11.680]  joker clinton well what's kind of interesting of course is that these debates are always greatly
[03:01:11.680 --> 03:01:17.040]  affected by the expectations the expectations now for hillary are very high the expectations for
[03:01:17.040 --> 03:01:24.240]  trump are suitably low and i have no doubt that he will exceed them he uh has got the
[03:01:24.240 --> 03:01:29.760]  counter punch a little more aggressively the i don't care about him looking presidential i just
[03:01:29.760 --> 03:01:36.480]  wanted to look like donald trump just be donald trump uh and i think he will do just fine i also
[03:01:36.480 --> 03:01:41.360]  if i were giving him advice on this matter uh and i would never talk about what advice i've ever
[03:01:41.360 --> 03:01:48.240]  given him but i would try to ignore the extraneous attacks no one cares about miss venezuela not when
[03:01:48.240 --> 03:01:52.480]  hillary clinton has empowered you know people in the middle east who are running around cutting
[03:01:52.480 --> 03:01:58.400]  women's genitals off uh and who are stoning women exactly don't defend what she makes up bring up the
[03:01:58.400 --> 03:02:02.960]  fact that you're the one that supports cutting women's genitals off i mean just so i i would
[03:02:02.960 --> 03:02:09.600]  counsel him to just go in there and make his points and kind of ignore uh the the absurdities
[03:02:09.600 --> 03:02:15.760]  that she raises she's going to debate 101 yeah lecturers on cyber security lecturers on mandatory
[03:02:15.760 --> 03:02:21.760]  minimum sentences please give me a break so i think he's going to be uh uh very good in the next
[03:02:21.760 --> 03:02:26.480]  debate i think he was good in the last debate it's just that the mainstream media decided to
[03:02:26.480 --> 03:02:34.080]  reinterpret the debate in terms of what happened uh and we've seen this before one debate does not
[03:02:34.080 --> 03:02:40.960]  a campaign make the mainstream media and the historians all virtually all liberals try to
[03:02:40.960 --> 03:02:45.360]  tell you that john kennedy put nixon away in the first debate now isn't the second or third
[03:02:45.360 --> 03:02:50.400]  book counts there were four debates nixon won the last one he closed fast the momentum was
[03:02:50.400 --> 03:02:55.280]  with him in the final weeks not with kennedy was sitting still and they stole illinois and texas
[03:02:55.280 --> 03:02:59.920]  from kennedy they stole it from nixon won that race by scoring in the fourth debate but that's
[03:02:59.920 --> 03:03:06.480]  been airbrushed out of history but they had meant he did steal texas in illinois oh there's no question
[03:03:06.480 --> 03:03:12.000]  kennedy had to steal it because kennedy the the late momentum was with nixon eisenhower did
[03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:18.560]  my mentor's rallies in in new york philadelphia in la nixon was on his game he had hoarded his money
[03:03:18.560 --> 03:03:24.000]  till the end he outspent kennedy in the stretch and he won that race by a hair and they stole it
[03:03:24.000 --> 03:03:30.240]  from him why because he won the fourth debate he also won two and three and that brings me in closing
[03:03:30.240 --> 03:03:34.960]  the steal debate they admit they're federalizing they admit they're federalizing the debate what
[03:03:34.960 --> 03:03:40.160]  do we do about that how do we fight that yeah look the debate has been rigged from the beginning
[03:03:40.160 --> 03:03:44.720]  you know my strong feeling that the libertarian green party candidates should be in there both
[03:03:44.720 --> 03:03:49.600]  is a matter of what is right but also if you just want to make the hard-headed political
[03:03:49.600 --> 03:03:57.920]  calculation johnson plus stein is net negative hillary johnson plus stein is net negative hillary
[03:03:57.920 --> 03:04:01.680]  we should have trump the beginning should have insisted that they be in the debate or he wouldn't
[03:04:01.680 --> 03:04:08.720]  show up i agree but what do we do about election fraud well again i would urge people who are
[03:04:08.720 --> 03:04:16.880]  concerned about this to go to stop the steal dot org we're about to unveil uh our exit poll uh
[03:04:16.880 --> 03:04:22.640]  program which is entirely net based it's very sophisticated we're doing our targeting right
[03:04:22.640 --> 03:04:28.560]  now i would call it science poll or mega poll or something like that well we can talk about that
[03:04:28.560 --> 03:04:34.160]  but the concept of course is to get actual voters to tell us how they voted not how they're going to
[03:04:34.160 --> 03:04:41.600]  vote but how they voted on a very uh targeted precinct by precinct machine by machine basis
[03:04:41.600 --> 03:04:47.280]  so we can detect detect fraud by comparing the exit results with the action we'll talk tomorrow
[03:04:47.280 --> 03:04:52.400]  about this roger a quickening happening thank you roger stonestoneculture.com we'll talk to you

[03:05:02.240 --> 03:05:07.840]  nation's international body just made a serious power play against presidential hopeful donald trump
[03:05:07.840 --> 03:05:12.800]  the un ratified a climate deal earlier than expected effectively preventing him from
[03:05:12.800 --> 03:05:17.440]  canceling the deal as he swore he would do when he becomes president of the united states the group
[03:05:17.440 --> 03:05:22.240]  effectively took away his ability to renegotiate the terms of the agreement or cancel the agreement
[03:05:22.240 --> 03:05:28.480]  entirely his threat to stop the un some say has stimulated a rapid series of ratifications in
[03:05:28.480 --> 03:05:33.520]  china the us in europe and other leaders will likely move quickly to join this deal to stop any
[03:05:33.520 --> 03:05:39.440]  future debate the us is locked into it and once it takes effect the us cannot back out of the plan
[03:05:39.440 --> 03:05:45.040]  or force changes to it for at least four years now trump has opposed this deal since december
[03:05:45.040 --> 03:05:50.320]  and his initial criticism was that it unfairly favors other countries and treats america's
[03:05:50.320 --> 03:05:55.040]  energy industry poorly the un is ramming forward any measure that they know trump will oppose when
[03:05:55.040 --> 03:06:00.560]  he assumes office like this climate change mandate i'm margaret howell reporting for info wars dot

[03:08:48.880 --> 03:08:54.960]  baby ducklings uh we've got the chairman joint chief saying prepare for war with russia as big
[03:08:54.960 --> 03:09:00.480]  as world war two nuclear war what the hell is going on i've i've studied history i've been on air
[03:09:00.480 --> 03:09:06.240]  20 years i've never heard generals talk like this what is going on paul well they're trying to
[03:09:06.800 --> 03:09:12.560]  re-energize this uh regime change operation in syria i guarantee if hillary gets in within six
[03:09:12.560 --> 03:09:17.360]  months she'll be going into syria and it's already proven so great hasn't it an international
[03:09:17.360 --> 03:09:23.120]  migrant crisis thousands of people dead ruined countries strewn across the middle east she's
[03:09:23.120 --> 03:09:28.880]  gonna make that even worse now she's talking about going to war with russia if there's so much of a
[03:09:28.880 --> 03:09:33.920]  hint that they hacked some emails she actually came out and said that but if there's a nuclear war
[03:09:33.920 --> 03:09:40.560]  and a woman leads it then it's cool though right yeah exactly but why are you sexist i mean if a
[03:09:40.560 --> 03:09:45.120]  woman wants to have men have had their wars the woman wants to blow the planet up why not letter
[03:09:45.120 --> 03:09:49.760]  i mean come on let's be fair vagina i mean why would anyone question that yeah so they're doing
[03:09:49.760 --> 03:09:56.000]  they're doing drills where 40 million people in russia are practicing evacuation drills they've
[03:09:56.000 --> 03:10:03.280]  just built underground shelters because they're racist for 12 million people this is hyping up
[03:10:03.280 --> 03:10:08.960]  you've got their top ministry of defense tv channel warning people that nuclear war is on the horizon
[03:10:08.960 --> 03:10:12.800]  this is very real you've got the u.s army chief coming out and saying
[03:10:12.800 --> 03:10:17.520]  we're gonna destroy our enemies then he goes on to talk about russia it's obviously aimed at russia
[03:10:17.520 --> 03:10:21.280]  this is what's gonna happen if he'll have a senator kane said terrorism's dead
[03:10:23.600 --> 03:10:29.120]  no exactly but this this is what's gonna happen you've got that attack on the aid convoy a few
[03:10:29.120 --> 03:10:33.840]  weeks ago that's come out the independent investigators went in and looked it was a complete
[03:10:33.840 --> 03:10:40.480]  hoax russia didn't bomb an aid convoy from the sky the roads perfectly pristine these aid trucks
[03:10:40.480 --> 03:10:45.520]  look like they've been burnt out there's no evidence of an airstrike that looks like it was a complete
[03:10:45.520 --> 03:10:52.480]  hoax you've got every single media news channel hyping this war like they tried to hype it back
[03:10:52.480 --> 03:10:56.160]  in turn obviously you're gonna cover that i just brought that up i'm glad you're on top of that
[03:10:56.160 --> 03:11:00.480]  what else is on your radar i think trump should go to hayley and expose the the clinton foundation
[03:11:00.480 --> 03:11:04.720]  crimes while helping the Haitians and then flying to the u.s after the hurricane hits in a couple
[03:11:04.720 --> 03:11:09.280]  days i think that's a no-brainer move i've asked folks to send that video with info works dot com
[03:11:09.280 --> 03:11:15.840]  off to trump what do you think oh i think that's an excellent idea i mean you get Haitians and i've
[03:11:15.840 --> 03:11:20.400]  been to that island they absolutely hate the clintons they come to america to protest against
[03:11:20.400 --> 03:11:25.760]  them they're suffering with this extreme weather event right now that would be excellent to help
[03:11:25.760 --> 03:11:31.280]  out those people and obviously the optics and refocusing the entire narrative back on the
[03:11:31.280 --> 03:11:36.560]  clinton foundation that would be an amazing idea and of course it's it's not far for him to travel
[03:11:36.560 --> 03:11:42.320]  actually so yeah i know he's two hours away two hours off the coast uh i want to get to a clip
[03:11:42.320 --> 03:11:45.680]  and then hear what you're about to cover and let you get to it but there's so many clips what about
[03:11:45.680 --> 03:11:50.480]  clinton vp whips out the quote mexican card as if they actually care about mexicans they want to
[03:11:50.480 --> 03:11:55.680]  exploit their labor uh they're calling this uh what's the term you used on that
[03:11:59.520 --> 03:12:04.800]  his spandering i mean look mexicans know you can't just come to mexico and get everything free or
[03:12:04.800 --> 03:12:10.400]  come across the border with no driver's license or no evidence so let's play clinton vp whips out his
[03:12:10.400 --> 03:12:16.880]  mexican his span his his spanish king or this what we call pandering his spandering let's go
[03:12:16.880 --> 03:12:27.360]  out and play the club here it is hence versus k last night there's a lot of our crew talking about it
[03:12:29.440 --> 03:12:34.720]  as trump says women should be punished or mexicans are rapists and criminals i teller john mccain's
[03:12:34.720 --> 03:12:41.440]  not a hero he is showing you who he is senator you you you whipped out that mexican thing again
[03:12:41.440 --> 03:12:48.000]  and you are showing look can you defend it there are criminal aliens in this country tim who have
[03:12:48.000 --> 03:12:53.600]  come into this country illegally who are perpetrating violence and taking you want to use our rush
[03:12:53.600 --> 03:12:58.720]  against mexico he also said and many of them are good people you keep leaving that out of your
[03:12:58.720 --> 03:13:04.640]  talk if you want me to go back up to exactly the full thing is we need to vet people that are felons
[03:13:04.640 --> 03:13:08.640]  people that are rapist criminals that are running here mexico should take our criminals either he
[03:13:08.640 --> 03:13:14.080]  said that the speech we need to stop the criminals coming over he turns it into mexicans are rapists
[03:13:14.080 --> 03:13:20.560]  measure it all is wrong you know mexicans are all rapists i mean again it's the deception of this
[03:13:20.560 --> 03:13:27.280]  little grinch like creature let's let's finish the club who are perpetrating violence and taking
[03:13:27.280 --> 03:13:32.960]  you want to use our rush against mexico he also said and many of them are good people you keep
[03:13:32.960 --> 03:13:37.680]  leaving that out of your quote and if you want me to go there i'll go there but here's there is a
[03:13:37.680 --> 03:13:42.800]  choice here and it's it is it is a choice on life i couldn't be more proud to be standing with donald
[03:13:42.800 --> 03:13:50.400]  trump who's standing for the right to life it's a principle that senator cana and i'm very gentle
[03:13:50.400 --> 03:13:56.160]  about this because i really do respect you it's a principle that you embrace and i've appreciated
[03:13:56.160 --> 03:14:01.520]  the fact that you've supported uh the height amendment which bans the use of taxpayer funding
[03:14:01.520 --> 03:14:06.240]  for abortion in the past but that's not hillary clinton's view people need to understand we can
[03:14:06.240 --> 03:14:12.080]  come together as a nation we can create a culture of life more and more young people today are embracing
[03:14:12.800 --> 03:14:19.200]  life because we we we know we are we're we're better for it we can like mother teresa said at
[03:14:19.200 --> 03:14:23.760]  that famous national prayer breakfast this is important bring the let's welcome the children
[03:14:23.760 --> 03:14:29.440]  into our world there are so many families around the country who can't have children we could improve
[03:14:29.440 --> 03:14:34.640]  the option so that families that can't have children can adopt governor readily why children
[03:14:34.640 --> 03:14:38.640]  use trust when prices are making this is why i'm gonna get out of here you're a busy guy you can't
[03:14:38.640 --> 03:14:47.840]  do it in our broadcast i'm gonna leave you alone but i mean governor pence absolutely dominated uh
[03:14:47.840 --> 03:14:54.000]  creepy cane i mean he mopped the floor with him i hope that he's advising trump because and i know
[03:14:54.000 --> 03:15:00.640]  for rages as well you go ahead and take over but am i wrong was this not a routing yesterday well it
[03:15:00.640 --> 03:15:06.080]  it was a complete routing and what he did well was dismiss an attack that's what trump needs to do
[03:15:06.080 --> 03:15:10.480]  it's well you said this about a woman you may have called a woman fat 20 years ago so what
[03:15:10.480 --> 03:15:15.520]  americans don't care about that that's not going to impact the future of america dismiss it move on
[03:15:15.520 --> 03:15:19.120]  let's talk about libya let's talk about the emails let's talk about clinton foundation
[03:15:19.120 --> 03:15:22.240]  talking about you would happen to even in a hotel room together and her mother once
[03:15:22.240 --> 03:15:27.840]  salivates over chopping women's journals off i mean this is crazy exactly don't get stuck down
[03:15:27.840 --> 03:15:33.120]  those rabbit holes of constantly having to defend yourself for mean comments you may or may not
[03:15:33.120 --> 03:15:37.200]  have made because the american people don't care about that that's not going to affect the future
[03:15:37.200 --> 03:15:44.560]  of america um on a on a wider basis tim cane is going to be your president if hillary clinton's
[03:15:44.560 --> 03:15:50.720]  health fails which it inevitably will at some point this is a man who refused to refer to
[03:15:50.720 --> 03:15:56.960]  himself as a man he said he was hillary clinton's right hand person he was so afraid of being
[03:15:56.960 --> 03:16:04.400]  politically incorrect he refused to call himself a man so he's a he's a pc or it's a pc high priest
[03:16:04.960 --> 03:16:10.960]  exactly do we want creepy kane as america's last president uh molesting the nation politically
[03:16:12.640 --> 03:16:17.440]  there was a good tweet actually which kind of summed it up for me mike penn sounds like a wise
[03:16:17.440 --> 03:16:23.760]  uncle who tells you stories about life that have important lessons tim kane is the uncle that touches
[03:16:23.760 --> 03:16:30.000]  you and drudge got that photo up today of tim kane he literally looks like one of these creepy
[03:16:30.000 --> 03:16:35.520]  clowns that's been stalking americans across the country that's going to be your president at some
[03:16:35.520 --> 03:16:39.760]  point chances are given what's going on well don't discriminate against creepy clowns we'll put the
[03:16:39.760 --> 03:16:43.600]  drudge image up right now let's put it up on screen for tb viewers paul i'm punching out go ahead
[03:16:45.120 --> 03:16:51.520]  so we're going to go to that clip i believe we've got time here tim kane had to bow to the gods of
[03:16:51.520 --> 03:16:57.680]  political correctness that he couldn't even refer to himself as a man during the debate with mike
[03:16:57.680 --> 03:17:07.920]  pens last night let's go to that clip that is some dramatic buildup oh we have the clip here
[03:17:07.920 --> 03:17:17.520]  look here's mike pencil that referred himself as a man there it is that is dramatic ladies and
[03:17:17.520 --> 03:17:21.920]  gentlemen paul does you send them these clips beforehand because they usually pretty go to these
[03:17:21.920 --> 03:17:26.080]  clips it's a good thing i'm here interrupting isn't it no no i sent the clip we can get to it later it
[03:17:26.080 --> 03:17:29.520]  doesn't matter oh hey hey all i wanted to do is tell me is the clip gonna come
[03:17:32.160 --> 03:17:36.160]  i think they're all gone i think everybody behind me in that room has been teleported they will not
[03:17:36.160 --> 03:17:42.800]  tell me no i sent the clip i'm panicking like they've just been attacked by martians but anyways get
[03:17:42.800 --> 03:17:49.200]  i mean get back into the clip paul go ahead no it was an important clip because this is supposedly
[03:17:49.200 --> 03:17:54.160]  the guy if hillary's health fails which it will at some point chances are he's going to be the
[03:17:54.160 --> 03:18:00.080]  guy standing up to vladimir putin standing up to china standing up to iran he hasn't even got the
[03:18:00.080 --> 03:18:05.840]  balls to refer to himself as a man he's so entwined in that politically correct thinking
[03:18:05.840 --> 03:18:10.400]  he's gonna be your president at some point there's a good chance yes in third time's the charm they
[03:18:10.400 --> 03:18:14.320]  they do have it they thought another clip that they have the clip uh describe this clip for us paul
[03:18:14.320 --> 03:18:21.600]  third time's the charm this is pens versus kane last night he refers to himself kane as hillary's
[03:18:21.600 --> 03:18:28.560]  right hand person he's so politically erect so the primary role is to be hillary clinton's right
[03:18:28.560 --> 03:18:33.600]  hand person and strong supporter as she puts together the most historic administration possible
[03:18:33.600 --> 03:18:40.240]  and i relish that role i'm so proud of her he's her right hand person it's why do men have to
[03:18:40.240 --> 03:18:45.920]  neuter themselves to fit with progressive orthodoxy i mean tim kane is a man why is it embarrassing
[03:18:45.920 --> 03:18:49.760]  to say that he didn't choose to be a man he was born that way that's the biological reality that
[03:18:49.760 --> 03:18:54.560]  the rest of us are busy denying but it doesn't make it any less true why should he have to pretend
[03:18:54.560 --> 03:18:58.000]  otherwise you're wondering why men aren't voting for hillary and boy they're not maybe this is why
[03:18:58.640 --> 03:19:04.880]  right if you're a man admit you're a man that's the message i get from tucker crossin so there
[03:19:04.880 --> 03:19:12.000]  you have it tim kane unable to refer to himself as a man he calls himself hillary's right hand person
[03:19:12.000 --> 03:19:17.920]  again good chance he's gonna be the next president if not he might run to be the president four years
[03:19:17.920 --> 03:19:23.840]  later is he gonna have the balls to stand up to vladimir putin to stand up to china to stand up to
[03:19:23.840 --> 03:19:30.480]  iran given the fact that he can't even refer to himself as a right hand man he has to use the
[03:19:30.480 --> 03:19:37.760]  politically correct term person absolutely amazing but again mike pens crushed it in the debate
[03:19:37.760 --> 03:19:44.320]  the problem is that almost 50 of the u.s public don't know who kane or pens are so it might not
[03:19:44.320 --> 03:19:49.440]  have a massive effect on the polls but it's a good role model for donald trump going forward
[03:19:49.440 --> 03:19:55.520]  into this huge debate on sunday where i believe he has to score a significant victory over hillary
[03:19:55.520 --> 03:20:00.400]  clinton and mike pens has given him the example on how to do it will be back after the break stage
[03:20:00.400 --> 03:20:04.400]  tuned
[03:20:08.320 --> 03:20:15.840]  we're skipping right all right continuing we've got another terror attack in europe this is out of
[03:20:15.840 --> 03:20:22.960]  bright bar again in belgium the land of cultural enrichment two police officers were attacked and
[03:20:22.960 --> 03:20:27.840]  stabbed in a suspected terror attack in the brussel suburb of charbie at lunchtime wednesday
[03:20:27.840 --> 03:20:32.560]  as one of the city's main rail stations was closed by a bomb threat we also had another
[03:20:32.560 --> 03:20:38.320]  incident a few days ago but the two events took place near simultaneously in the belgian capital
[03:20:38.320 --> 03:20:43.120]  this afternoon the brussels north station was evacuated by police and army troops with armoured
[03:20:43.120 --> 03:20:49.520]  personnel carriers stationed outside as the bomb squad searched the location for explosives now they
[03:20:49.520 --> 03:20:56.240]  actually ID'd this person pretty quickly which is unusual for belgium we've seen cases before where
[03:20:56.240 --> 03:21:01.840]  they try to hide the identity of the individual because it has to have nothing to do with islam
[03:21:01.840 --> 03:21:08.560]  but they've actually identified him as hitchham d they're not giving his surname but his first name
[03:21:08.560 --> 03:21:17.760]  is arabic surprise surprise and he's been a belgian citizen he was born in 1973 again obviously a
[03:21:17.760 --> 03:21:25.040]  muslim but he's a belgian citizen who lives in one of these islamic getouts so this is a guy who
[03:21:25.040 --> 03:21:30.800]  hasn't come in from syria hasn't come in from afghanistan isn't a newly arrived immigrant
[03:21:30.800 --> 03:21:37.600]  he's a supposedly integrated migrant not even that he's a belgian citizen obviously his parents
[03:21:37.600 --> 03:21:43.440]  were probably immigrants but he's supposedly integrated he's living in belgium but he's
[03:21:43.440 --> 03:21:50.000]  living in an islamic ghetto it's like mollambique where the paris massacre suspects many of them
[03:21:50.000 --> 03:21:56.000]  were living abdeslam again protected by his neighbors for months and months who refused to
[03:21:56.000 --> 03:22:01.760]  report him to the authorities even though they knew that he was living amongst them this is the
[03:22:01.760 --> 03:22:08.400]  problem these islamic ghettos cultivate radicalization the belgian government does nothing about it
[03:22:08.400 --> 03:22:15.120]  they just bring in more muslim migrants who all flock to these islamic ghettos who are all radicalized
[03:22:15.120 --> 03:22:22.960]  in the same vein again stabbed two police officers obviously a terrorist attack it's going to happen
[03:22:22.960 --> 03:22:29.120]  again and again because we've been sold this lie that multiculturalism works it doesn't this is mono
[03:22:29.120 --> 03:22:33.920]  culture that we're seeing again and again many of these people don't want to integrate and it's a
[03:22:33.920 --> 03:22:39.120]  big problem similar story here out of on a similar subject out of the express
[03:22:39.120 --> 03:22:46.080]  yes EU orders british press not to reveal when terrorists are muslims meddling brussels have
[03:22:46.080 --> 03:22:50.560]  said the british press should not report when terrorists are muslims in a slew of demands
[03:22:50.560 --> 03:22:57.280]  to the government to crack down on media so this is a group within the european union european
[03:22:57.280 --> 03:23:06.480]  commission against racism and tolerance ecri that have ordered the british media to not report
[03:23:06.480 --> 03:23:14.160]  the identity of a terrorist who is muslim whenever there's a terrorist attack because quote it's no
[03:23:14.160 --> 03:23:19.760]  coincidence that racist violence is on the rise in the uk and it goes on to say in this context
[03:23:19.760 --> 03:23:25.520]  it draws attention to a recent study which suggests that when the media stresses the muslim background
[03:23:25.520 --> 03:23:30.800]  of perpetrators of terrorist attacks and devote significant coverage to it in other words tell
[03:23:30.800 --> 03:23:36.080]  the truth about what happened which is kind of what the media is supposed to do that's what reporters
[03:23:36.080 --> 03:23:41.120]  are supposed to do after terrorist attack happened who was behind it what was their motive that's
[03:23:41.120 --> 03:23:48.240]  what people want to know that's their job but no can't do that anymore because it's islamophobic
[03:23:48.240 --> 03:23:55.120]  and it well encourages a violent backlash against muslims and that's the most important thing is
[03:23:56.000 --> 03:24:01.840]  possibly causing someone to make bean comments towards a muslim on public transport the day
[03:24:01.840 --> 03:24:10.240]  after a massive terror attack actually ordering the british media to censor itself and not report
[03:24:10.240 --> 03:24:19.120]  the identity the belief system the motivation of the perpetrator so it's gone beyond saying not all
[03:24:19.120 --> 03:24:25.440]  muslim saying islam is a religion of peace now to the level that they're saying don't even report
[03:24:25.440 --> 03:24:31.920]  the fact they're muslims the next phase which i've talked about before is to have terror attacks happen
[03:24:31.920 --> 03:24:39.040]  and then for the media to just not report on them at all like they didn't even have or to say that
[03:24:39.040 --> 03:24:45.680]  it was just a criminal a mentally ill person to hide the very nature of the attack this is the
[03:24:45.680 --> 03:24:52.320]  danger of political correctness we've gone through the examples political correctness kills it killed
[03:24:52.320 --> 03:24:57.760]  in the case of the sanbernadino terrorists again they were receiving packages to their address
[03:24:58.480 --> 03:25:03.760]  the neighbors were suspicious they were thinking about reporting them to the authorities
[03:25:03.760 --> 03:25:11.040]  they didn't because they feared being called racist concrete example of how political correctness
[03:25:11.040 --> 03:25:18.240]  when it comes to islamophobia those concerns trumped safety concerns people died as a result
[03:25:18.240 --> 03:25:25.920]  you can look at brother of england again on the doorstep of where i used to live for 10 years
[03:25:25.920 --> 03:25:33.760]  plus over a decade thousands of young girls traffic sexually abused by muslim pedophile
[03:25:33.760 --> 03:25:40.240]  rape gangs none of them were caught because the authorities refused to believe the victims
[03:25:40.240 --> 03:25:45.920]  said they were racist said they were islamophobic didn't want to prosecute the perpetrators
[03:25:45.920 --> 03:25:51.840]  for fear themselves in local government and police have been called bigoted islamophobic
[03:25:51.840 --> 03:25:58.720]  racist another concrete example of how political correctness harms and we're seeing it again now
[03:25:58.720 --> 03:26:04.880]  they're ordering the british media not to report that terrorists are muslims you know we had cnn a
[03:26:04.880 --> 03:26:11.040]  few weeks ago with the new york attack you know chastising donald trump for saying it was a bomb
[03:26:11.040 --> 03:26:15.200]  well it was a bomb but that's politically incorrect you can't say the word bomb anymore
[03:26:15.200 --> 03:26:21.200]  you had the bbc reporting asking the question a few months ago is it politically incorrect to
[03:26:21.200 --> 03:26:28.160]  call terrorists terrorists they actually asked that question because god forbid you might offend a
[03:26:28.160 --> 03:26:34.960]  terrorist so we've got this propaganda at the moment sweeping europe as people are arrested
[03:26:34.960 --> 03:26:41.520]  for criticizing angela merkel on facebook trying to convince us that islamophobic hate crimes
[03:26:41.520 --> 03:26:48.800]  are exploding they're not it's a complete lie hate crime prosecutions have fallen but they floated
[03:26:48.800 --> 03:26:55.520]  that myth so they could blame it on brexit so they could create this narrative that this hate
[03:26:55.520 --> 03:27:02.640]  this hate crime epidemic is sweeping the country it's not but what do we see after every single
[03:27:02.640 --> 03:27:09.680]  terror attack we saw it after niece the main concern from the regressive left is islamophobia
[03:27:09.680 --> 03:27:14.880]  well i'm sorry but somebody's saying something mean to a muslim on public transport that's
[03:27:14.880 --> 03:27:22.320]  not nice but that's not the biggest threat okay that's not the biggest concern islamophashism
[03:27:22.320 --> 03:27:28.080]  is the biggest concern until until we recognize it realize it and actually have the guts to say
[03:27:28.080 --> 03:27:34.000]  the term islamic terrorism then we're only going to encourage more attacks and there's been another
[03:27:34.000 --> 03:27:42.800]  one in brussels today this is the issue we're all upset about so-called islamophobia upsetting
[03:27:42.800 --> 03:27:48.400]  muslims god forbid hate crime epidemic which actually doesn't exist sweeping europe when on
[03:27:48.400 --> 03:27:55.120]  the flip side we're importing millions of people who adhere to a belief system that spawned something
[03:27:55.680 --> 03:28:02.880]  known as the rape game this is part of their belief system you have afghanistan we're part of
[03:28:02.880 --> 03:28:08.720]  their belief system is for the elder men to rape young boys just part of their culture
[03:28:09.600 --> 03:28:12.960]  again us troops tried to blow the whistle on that they were told to shut up
[03:28:14.000 --> 03:28:19.520]  just part of their culture they actually have something called tahrosh gamia the rape game
[03:28:20.480 --> 03:28:27.600]  and you've seen it in egypt in tahia square logan the reporter again dragged beaten raped
[03:28:27.600 --> 03:28:35.200]  by tens and tens of men dozens of men thought she was going to die that's the rape game in action
[03:28:35.760 --> 03:28:41.120]  we've seen it in clover we've seen it at music festivals in sweden that's the real concern
[03:28:42.240 --> 03:28:48.720]  but they don't even report on it they only report on the supposed islamophobic hate crime wave
[03:28:48.720 --> 03:28:55.200]  that speak that sweeping the country when actual hate crime prosecutions are down it's a complete
[03:28:55.200 --> 03:29:02.880]  myth completely invented by the media we just had october fest in germany again massive cultural
[03:29:02.880 --> 03:29:08.080]  festival god forbid germans celebrating their own culture that's racist in and of itself probably
[03:29:09.200 --> 03:29:15.120]  300 000 less people attended this year why well because germany has been beset by a wave of
[03:29:15.120 --> 03:29:20.880]  terror attacks by migrants in most cases over the entire summer they've had cologne they've had
[03:29:20.880 --> 03:29:31.680]  hamburg they've had pride this is the cultural enrichment that we're being told to tolerate
[03:29:32.960 --> 03:29:42.160]  germans on ads in hijabs saying this must be tolerated this is the new germany well not for
[03:29:42.160 --> 03:29:48.400]  a lot of germans who are now calling on merkel to go she's losing support fast we'll get more into
[03:29:48.400 --> 03:29:53.920]  after break on the alex don't show a lot don't go away we're on the march the empire's on the run
[03:29:54.800 --> 03:29:57.680]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:30:01.680 --> 03:30:06.080]  last night's vice presidential debate centered heavily around the topic of russia and in the
[03:30:06.080 --> 03:30:11.120]  event of potential military theater who would best be able to handle vladimir putin one thing is
[03:30:11.120 --> 03:30:16.160]  clear the u.s russia relationship has been in a freefall the obama administration proclaimed
[03:30:16.160 --> 03:30:22.160]  bilateral peace talks over syria are quote dead with moscow and suspended a 16-year-old treaty
[03:30:22.160 --> 03:30:27.040]  meant to reduce the risk of nuclear proliferation the u.s state department threatened russia over
[03:30:27.040 --> 03:30:31.920]  their actions in syria and according to the white house spokesperson josh urnist he said
[03:30:31.920 --> 03:30:36.960]  everybody's patience with russia has run out continuing on saying russians have been complicit
[03:30:36.960 --> 03:30:42.000]  in the syrian tragedy well this comes as the u.s announced this week that were withdrawing personnel
[03:30:42.000 --> 03:30:47.200]  dispatched to the middle east in anticipation of a ceasefire deal reached on september the night
[03:30:47.200 --> 03:30:51.840]  putin is also withdrawing only he's withdrawing from an accord that committed both countries
[03:30:51.840 --> 03:30:57.040]  to eliminating stockpiles of plutonium plutonium that's used as the core material in some types
[03:30:57.040 --> 03:31:02.480]  of nuclear weapons i'm margaret hell reporting for info wars dot com we're selling a product

[03:33:31.760 --> 03:33:38.800]  second a video that i put out again they tried to paint trump as a misogynist as a sexist with
[03:33:38.800 --> 03:33:44.240]  this it completely blew up in their faces but the mainstream media is still insistent on peddling
[03:33:44.240 --> 03:33:49.680]  this absolute hoax we're going to get to that clip here in a minute but first i want to encourage

[03:35:33.520 --> 03:35:40.560]  elon musk is a sexist is a misogynist why did he make mean comments about women god forbid
[03:35:40.560 --> 03:35:48.800]  20 years ago no elon musk is not following enough women on twitter and that means he's a closet
[03:35:48.800 --> 03:35:55.840]  sexist yes that's actually a story put out by vice dot com mother book motherboard
[03:35:55.840 --> 03:36:03.280]  the elon musk the inventor the technological guru is a sexist because he follows more men
[03:36:03.280 --> 03:36:10.960]  than women on twitter elon musk shot back he said quote i use twitter for news organizations
[03:36:10.960 --> 03:36:17.520]  my instagram has the same amount of women as men what's up with the phony pc police axe grinding
[03:36:18.400 --> 03:36:22.480]  and you can probably guess what their response was to that oh so your knees instagram to look
[03:36:22.480 --> 03:36:28.880]  at women god forbid god forbid a man would actually enjoy looking at attractive women we can't have
[03:36:28.880 --> 03:36:34.720]  that anymore that's not allowed that sexist but just think about this obviously there are more
[03:36:34.720 --> 03:36:41.360]  men than women in the public eye when it comes to politics and technology that's just a fact of course
[03:36:41.360 --> 03:36:47.520]  that's the fault of the evil patriarchy but that's another subject he's not even using twitter to
[03:36:47.520 --> 03:36:53.440]  follow individuals the vast majority of people or accounts that he follows on twitter on news
[03:36:53.440 --> 03:37:01.200]  organizations cnn writers whatever not individuals firstly what kind of lame frigging journalists
[03:37:01.200 --> 03:37:08.560]  thought that who elon musk follows on twitter is even a story to begin with i mean we were at the
[03:37:08.560 --> 03:37:14.400]  most crucial time in the election we've got nuclear war with russia being talked about
[03:37:14.400 --> 03:37:20.880]  and this idiot is writing about who elon musk follows on twitter and saying that makes him a
[03:37:20.880 --> 03:37:29.120]  sexist give me a break again policing of language policing of thought it's not enough
[03:37:29.120 --> 03:37:35.600]  they're now policing who you follow on twitter these are the control freaks that want to run
[03:37:35.600 --> 03:37:42.160]  our lives remember the guardian writer the feminist she'd looked over somebody's shoulder
[03:37:42.160 --> 03:37:48.400]  on a train they were scrolling through who they followed on twitter and this thought criminal
[03:37:48.400 --> 03:37:56.720]  this misogynist this evil sexist followed more men than women she wrote an article publicly
[03:37:56.720 --> 03:38:04.560]  shaming him saudi arabia has only just allowed women to ride bicycles for fun they're not even
[03:38:04.560 --> 03:38:10.960]  allowed to ride them for transportation purposes and yet this is what feminists are concerned about
[03:38:10.960 --> 03:38:20.000]  who elon musk follows on twitter i mean give me a break another social justice warrior story again
[03:38:20.000 --> 03:38:26.960]  this is up on my twitter you can go and watch the video university of kansas aggressive intolerant mob
[03:38:26.960 --> 03:38:35.120]  of sjw surround and beret young americans for freedom meeting and it's so progressive for them to
[03:38:35.120 --> 03:38:42.560]  encircle like a mob ravenous aggressive fist pumping because this group young americans for
[03:38:42.560 --> 03:38:49.120]  freedom dared to have a meeting in their own university literally there's five of them sat
[03:38:49.120 --> 03:38:59.760]  around a table surrounded by 50 60 70 angry sjw's lecturing them about their temerity for merely
[03:38:59.760 --> 03:39:06.480]  having a meeting they don't get to have a safe space but the sjw's do go watch this video on my
[03:39:06.480 --> 03:39:12.480]  twitter feed again they're berating them they're banging their fists on the table saying how dare
[03:39:12.480 --> 03:39:21.040]  you even speak with your white cisgender privilege one of the sjw says to one of the young americans
[03:39:21.040 --> 03:39:28.800]  for freedom participants quote how dare you tell me to calm down you cisgender white male well news
[03:39:28.800 --> 03:39:36.080]  flash banging your fists on the table and yelling at people to shut up because they're white isn't
[03:39:36.080 --> 03:39:42.640]  a substitute for an argument and you're the racist again this is what we see over and over again the
[03:39:42.640 --> 03:39:48.560]  very people who cry you're racist you're racist order all day long they're the ones judging people
[03:39:48.560 --> 03:39:52.800]  on their skin color they're the ones saying that certain people with a certain skin color
[03:39:52.800 --> 03:39:59.680]  can't have an opinion don't have free speech that is the ultimate form of racism again
[03:40:00.560 --> 03:40:07.920]  they don't believe inequality these people are racist actual racist collectively judging people
[03:40:07.920 --> 03:40:12.960]  on their skin color denying people their rights because of their skin color that is the very
[03:40:12.960 --> 03:40:22.160]  definition of racism again determining that you can censor someone and shut down their private
[03:40:22.160 --> 03:40:28.720]  assembly and impinge on their free speech rights because of their skin color that makes you the
[03:40:28.720 --> 03:40:36.800]  biggest okay you've literally got this sjw moron lecturing this guy banging her fist on the table
[03:40:36.800 --> 03:40:44.240]  saying that how dare he even challenge her he's white how dare he even have a voice well that
[03:40:44.960 --> 03:40:51.360]  is the sjw engaging in hate speech they're the ones who engage in hate speech they're the ones
[03:40:51.360 --> 03:40:58.240]  who engage in flagrant racism and it needs to be pointed out you've got another clip which i posted
[03:40:58.240 --> 03:41:04.960]  earlier again another rally out on the street numerous people involved you've got a feminist
[03:41:04.960 --> 03:41:11.840]  chanting assault is not okay that's their chant assault is not okay while she physically assaults
[03:41:11.840 --> 03:41:19.440]  a man and slaps him in the face she's there on video just smacking him around again while chanting
[03:41:19.440 --> 03:41:27.520]  assault is not okay complete unbridled hypocrisy these people are violent these people are aggressive
[03:41:27.520 --> 03:41:32.560]  these people are the real racist and they demonstrate it on a daily basis again and again
[03:41:32.560 --> 03:41:39.040]  again you see it all the time so again we've got that story that video and that's going to go up on
[03:41:39.040 --> 03:41:46.480]  info wars dot com now of course alicia micardo came out or hillary clinton released her name
[03:41:46.480 --> 03:41:51.600]  during the debate in an attempt to attack donald trump because he may allegedly have called a woman
[03:41:51.600 --> 03:41:57.920]  fat 20 years ago god forbid i mean it's not like hillary wrecked the middle east and wants war
[03:41:57.920 --> 03:42:02.640]  with russia that's not important donald trump may have called somebody miss piggy 20 years ago no
[03:42:02.640 --> 03:42:08.720]  actual evidence for that as we'll see in the clip but they're still floating this and we're
[03:42:08.720 --> 03:42:13.680]  going to talk about it more after the video the truth about alicia micardo here it is hillary
[03:42:13.680 --> 03:42:18.880]  clinton the amazing feminist who accepts hundreds of millions of dollars from countries that oppress
[03:42:18.880 --> 03:42:24.720]  women calls women bimbos and intimidates bill clinton's rape victims played the vagina card
[03:42:24.720 --> 03:42:30.320]  once again during the debates in an effort to smear trump as a woman hater and one of the
[03:42:30.320 --> 03:42:37.680]  worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest donald she has a name where did you find
[03:42:37.680 --> 03:42:44.000]  her name is alicia machado where did you find and she has become a u.s citizen and you can bet
[03:42:44.000 --> 03:42:49.600]  a really she's going to vote this novella okay good so who is alicia micardo this amazing role
[03:42:49.600 --> 03:42:54.880]  model for young women who's standing up against a torrent of misogynistic abuse she's accused of
[03:42:54.880 --> 03:43:01.600]  driving the getaway car for a murder attempt she threatened to kill a judge she had an illegitimate
[03:43:01.600 --> 03:43:08.960]  child with a mexican drug lord she also had sex on reality tv while being engaged to someone else
[03:43:08.960 --> 03:43:15.440]  what a fantastic feminist role model for young women this is hillary's campaign poster child
[03:43:16.320 --> 03:43:22.800]  he can say whatever he wants to say i don't care you know i have my past of course everybody has
[03:43:23.440 --> 03:43:28.880]  everybody has a past yeah not everybody's past includes being accused of acting as an accomplice
[03:43:28.880 --> 03:43:35.440]  in an attempted murder and threatening to kill a judge that's kind of out of the ordinary alicia
[03:43:35.440 --> 03:43:41.520]  but trump is the villain of the piece for allegedly fat shaming her even though cnn
[03:43:41.520 --> 03:43:48.480]  did exactly the same thing he's bad for being judgmental of beauty in a beauty pageant that he
[03:43:48.480 --> 03:43:54.880]  owned watch the video where trump supposedly fat shames her he's being incredibly complimentary in
[03:43:54.880 --> 03:44:00.240]  fact it's trump who's defending her against others who are pressuring her over her weight i
[03:44:00.240 --> 03:44:05.200]  felt that alicia was one of the most beautiful women i'd ever seen it was incredible and all of
[03:44:05.200 --> 03:44:11.280]  the folks that were here agreed with that alicia is like me and like a lot of other people i love
[03:44:11.280 --> 03:44:16.960]  to eat we all love to eat not all of us some of you are lucky but we eat we like to eat and she
[03:44:16.960 --> 03:44:21.040]  had tremendous pressure put on her with the wind and everything else plus she was going from country
[03:44:21.040 --> 03:44:26.400]  to country all foreign places and there was a huge amount of pressure when she won the contest i had
[03:44:26.400 --> 03:44:31.280]  never seen anybody more beautiful and she's totally beautiful now you know you have a lot of people
[03:44:31.280 --> 03:44:36.240]  that have problems with weight eating disorders whatever you want to call it a lot of people i
[03:44:36.240 --> 03:44:40.800]  mean i'm looking a lot of you reporters and i can't believe how many showed up but a lot of you
[03:44:40.800 --> 03:44:48.240]  folks have weight problems i hate to tell you that doesn't it doesn't micardo also brazenly lied
[03:44:48.240 --> 03:44:54.160]  when she said that trump's mean comments led to her eating disorder she had that disorder before
[03:44:54.160 --> 03:45:01.520]  she even entered miss universe you said as a result of what he said to you you developed an eating
[03:45:01.520 --> 03:45:09.440]  disorder bulimia and anorexia but you had said publicly uh at the time that you you suffered
[03:45:09.440 --> 03:45:16.000]  from both of those eating disorders prior to the miss universe contest and really you know had
[03:45:16.000 --> 03:45:23.840]  no no never never never uh prior than miss universe pride and i never well this is this is from
[03:45:23.840 --> 03:45:28.960]  any problem this is part of the miss universe well this is what washington post this is sorry
[03:45:30.000 --> 03:45:32.960]  let me just tell you well let me just tell you what i'm referring to and then you and then you
[03:45:32.960 --> 03:45:40.640]  respond um the washington post from may 16th 1997 reported this quote from you i was anorexic
[03:45:40.640 --> 03:45:46.640]  and bulimic but almost all of us are when i was preparing for miss universe it was an obsession
[03:45:46.640 --> 03:45:54.160]  for me to not gain weight by the time i won i was actually recovering but the year leading to it i
[03:45:54.160 --> 03:46:01.520]  didn't eat at all and whatever i ate i threw up i weighed 116 pounds when i won i was skeletal
[03:46:02.080 --> 03:46:06.560]  so it sounds like without diminishing anything that you went through after trump it does sound
[03:46:06.560 --> 03:46:11.600]  sound like you had an eating disorder prior to his comments and prior to winning so trump
[03:46:11.600 --> 03:46:17.200]  drew attention to this sex tape where micardo romps on screen while being engaged to someone else
[03:46:17.200 --> 03:46:23.280]  and hillary accused him of being a conspiracy theorist claiming that micardo never appeared in
[03:46:23.280 --> 03:46:30.400]  a sex tape even though she clearly did appear in a sex tape but the new york times says its fact
[03:46:30.400 --> 03:46:38.720]  checkers found no evidence of a sex tape so she's having sex on tape and that's not a sex tape oh but
[03:46:38.720 --> 03:46:44.960]  that was just a risque scene the times reported listen to what micardo was recorded on tape saying
[03:46:44.960 --> 03:46:51.600]  during the encounter oh your dick my love what a tasty dick your dick is divine does that sound
[03:46:51.600 --> 03:46:59.360]  risque to you or does it sound like what you'd hear on a sex tape the new york times is flagrantly
[03:46:59.360 --> 03:47:06.800]  lying to its readers and trump has been vindicated yet again alicia micardo clearly appeared in a sex
[03:47:06.800 --> 03:47:14.800]  tape that's a fact you had grimy sex on national television yet you accused trump of objectifying
[03:47:14.800 --> 03:47:21.840]  you yeah alicia i think you did a pretty good job of objectifying yourself hillary's decisions led
[03:47:21.840 --> 03:47:27.200]  to four dead americans a ruined country the displacement of millions of people and the
[03:47:27.200 --> 03:47:34.480]  international migrant crisis and yet trumps the terrible person for allegedly calling a woman fat
[03:47:34.480 --> 03:47:41.520]  20 years ago and this is what the media wants to talk about hillary vowed to crucify women who were
[03:47:41.520 --> 03:47:48.480]  victims of her sexual predator husband she laughed about defending a child rapist who molested a 12
[03:47:48.480 --> 03:47:54.000]  year old girl she takes mountains of cash from saudi arabia a country that treats women like
[03:47:54.000 --> 03:48:00.080]  cattle she intimidates vulnerable female rape victims but it's trump who hates women because
[03:48:00.080 --> 03:48:05.760]  he called rosio donnell fat and encouraged miss universe to lose weight while representing a
[03:48:05.760 --> 03:48:12.080]  beauty pageant that he owned really women don't fear for their life because of donnell trump they
[03:48:12.080 --> 03:48:18.160]  do fear for their life because of the clinton's until the media reports on hillary intimidating
[03:48:18.160 --> 03:48:25.040]  bill's rape victims they can shut the hell up about trumps treatment of women alicia micardo
[03:48:25.040 --> 03:48:31.280]  is a terrible role model for young women and yes she appeared in a sex tape and now all this has
[03:48:31.280 --> 03:48:37.120]  come to light it's blown up in hillary's stupid face which is why the new york times and the rest
[03:48:37.120 --> 03:48:48.480]  of the corrupt establishment media is having to lie about it to run defense for her that is the
[03:48:48.480 --> 03:48:53.440]  truth about alicia micardo it's up on my youtube channel again exposing another one of these media
[03:48:53.440 --> 03:48:59.520]  hoaxes six months ago i wasn't even vehemently that pro trump i mean i supported ran paul at the
[03:48:59.520 --> 03:49:05.040]  start of the republic republican debates it was the media's obvious agenda in fact they came out
[03:49:05.040 --> 03:49:10.960]  themselves and said we've dispensed with any pretense of neutrality or objectivity we can't
[03:49:10.960 --> 03:49:15.120]  let this man in the white house we can't have him let him have his finger on the nuclear codes
[03:49:15.120 --> 03:49:20.800]  because he's literally hitler and he's going to destroy the world it was that kind of hysteria
[03:49:20.800 --> 03:49:25.440]  and that kind of media hoax and they come out with these on a regular basis that drove me
[03:49:25.440 --> 03:49:32.480]  to be more pro trump simply because of this absolute complete bias in every single situation
[03:49:32.480 --> 03:49:38.960]  you saw it with alicia micardo again the new york times put out an article saying it was a conspiracy
[03:49:38.960 --> 03:49:44.960]  theory that their fact checkers didn't find any evidence for the fact that she was in a sex tape
[03:49:44.960 --> 03:49:52.320]  even though she was in a sex tape okay it's been public knowledge for years hillary tried to exalt
[03:49:52.320 --> 03:49:57.760]  this alicia micardo as a big feminist icon for her campaign which is based on absolutely nothing
[03:49:57.760 --> 03:50:04.400]  it's blown up in their faces but again how will it affect the polls we don't know we don't really
[03:50:04.400 --> 03:50:08.560]  get a sense of that benchmark but again if you actually dig into the facts it's being completely
[03:50:08.560 --> 03:50:15.920]  exposed on the subject of fact shaming which is not even what donald trump did but demi lavato is
[03:50:15.920 --> 03:50:21.360]  who is some vacuous airhead celebrity who i don't even care who it is criticized taylor swift for
[03:50:21.360 --> 03:50:29.120]  body shaming by body shaming her so this celebrity came out and said that taylor swift and her crew
[03:50:29.120 --> 03:50:34.800]  were sending out a bad message to young women because they were thin because they kept themselves
[03:50:34.800 --> 03:50:40.480]  in shape so body shaming is now not just saying that you know being fat is unattractive and unhealthy
[03:50:41.040 --> 03:50:49.360]  it's the mere act of not being fat and unattractive taking care of yourself being in shape that is
[03:50:49.360 --> 03:50:56.240]  now fat shaming according to social justice warriors and deeper down the rabbit hole we go
[03:50:56.240 --> 03:51:01.280]  we'll be back with the final segment of the alex joneshow after the break breaking news at info wars

[03:54:13.680 --> 03:54:19.920]  go back to the final segment of the alex jones show leonardo ecafrio says that if you don't
[03:54:19.920 --> 03:54:26.480]  believe in climate change you should not be allowed to hold public office this is a guy who
[03:54:27.360 --> 03:54:33.920]  literally takes dozens of dozens of private jet flights every year he has private yachts they
[03:54:33.920 --> 03:54:41.440]  don't run on solar power do they he flew on a private jet from new york to la six times in six
[03:54:41.440 --> 03:54:48.720]  weeks that came out in the sony hack leonardo de caprio is a complete hypocrite but he says if you
[03:54:48.720 --> 03:54:54.160]  don't believe in climate change you shouldn't be allowed to hold public office well if you take
[03:54:54.160 --> 03:55:01.680]  private jets leo to collect environmental awards you shouldn't be allowed to talk about global warming
[03:55:01.680 --> 03:55:08.320]  to talk about the environment complete absolute hypocrite in fact he tried to come back and claim
[03:55:08.320 --> 03:55:15.520]  oh i i don't make money to this carbon neutral charity which plants trees to offset my carbon
[03:55:15.520 --> 03:55:22.640]  footprint which he claimed was 11 tons a year well they actually did a study into this the average
[03:55:22.640 --> 03:55:29.680]  person in the us emits 19 tons of carbon dioxide a year and they're not leonardo de caprio they're
[03:55:29.680 --> 03:55:34.960]  not taking private jets everywhere to collect environmental awards they're not going out on
[03:55:34.960 --> 03:55:43.120]  giant yachts actually turned out that he was his carbon footprint was 44 tons in a single year
[03:55:43.120 --> 03:55:49.520]  and that was just from the airline trips that doesn't include the private yachts or anything else
