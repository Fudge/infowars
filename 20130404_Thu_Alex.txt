[00:00.000 --> 00:12.400]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.400 --> 00:21.160]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.160 --> 00:30.720]  welcome to the Alex Jones show it is Thursday April 4th 2013 and we are on
[00:30.720 --> 00:35.960]  the verge of war in North Korea that is the emphasis of the topic today but a
[00:35.960 --> 00:39.560]  lot of discussion happening here on the Alex Jones show this is Mike Adams the
[00:39.560 --> 00:43.720]  guest hosting for Alex but Alex is here in studio right now and we'll be dropping
[00:43.720 --> 00:47.320]  in from time to time with special reports and breaking news on North Korea
[00:47.320 --> 00:51.960]  we've got a couple of guests today three in fact two of them talking about
[00:51.960 --> 00:57.240]  important decentralized self-replicating food self-reliance technology that you
[00:57.240 --> 01:01.560]  will need if war breaks out and if martial law is declared and things
[01:01.560 --> 01:05.840]  begin to really implode we've also got a guest on geoengineering coming up in
[01:05.840 --> 01:09.520]  the third hour but again the main emphasis today is North Korea on the
[01:09.520 --> 01:14.040]  verge of war threatening America with nuclear strikes and here to tell us what's
[01:14.040 --> 01:18.760]  going to be happening in that realm is Alex Jones Alex Mike absolutely I was
[01:18.760 --> 01:22.920]  going to come in today and work on some of the administrative things in the new
[01:22.920 --> 01:26.360]  studio that you can see their building over there and all the work we're doing
[01:26.360 --> 01:29.560]  but we were talking last night you're like you really want me to do the show
[01:29.560 --> 01:32.720]  tomorrow because all this North Korea stuff and you're absolutely right this
[01:32.720 --> 01:37.120]  is incredibly important and you also have the calls the sensor the internet
[01:37.120 --> 01:41.160]  going on not just here but in Europe trying to mirror the communist Chinese
[01:41.160 --> 01:45.640]  we've got those attacks going on we're gonna talk about senior advisor Dan
[01:45.640 --> 01:49.920]  Pfeiffer this is the senior advisor to the president this is who the globalist
[01:49.920 --> 01:55.280]  you know tell Obama what to do through this is the guy that helps load the
[01:55.280 --> 01:59.600]  teleprompter this is the guy that chooses the speeches predominantly that
[01:59.600 --> 02:04.760]  Obama is gonna have loaded into his teleprompter he is bemoaning on C-span
[02:04.760 --> 02:09.360]  the drudge report and when he attacks the drudge report and tells the media
[02:09.360 --> 02:12.640]  not to go read it which and oh but it doesn't have the power it used to us
[02:12.640 --> 02:16.400]  because it has more power right it shows that they're scared of the entire
[02:16.400 --> 02:21.680]  alternative media and it also shows that we're having an effect because they're
[02:21.680 --> 02:26.160]  not all powerful they want to be in big listening glass buildings and marble
[02:26.160 --> 02:29.640]  buildings and you know millions of troops in black uniforms and armored
[02:29.640 --> 02:34.720]  vehicles and bullets to intimidate those of us that are awake but then to deny
[02:34.720 --> 02:38.480]  to the public that all this exists so also at the start of the third hour we
[02:38.480 --> 02:42.760]  have that ten minute report proving the new world order is real and showing their
[02:42.760 --> 02:45.880]  hoaxes that premiered on the nightly news last night we're gonna premiere that
[02:45.880 --> 02:50.160]  on the radio side today at 1 0 8 the start of the third hour then you've got
[02:50.160 --> 02:54.240]  your geoengineering expert coming on again they they say geoengineering
[02:54.240 --> 02:58.200]  doesn't exist now they admit there's giant government secret programs that we
[02:58.200 --> 03:03.840]  told people about 17 years ago so all of that and more but I've followed the
[03:03.840 --> 03:07.720]  Korean conflict from the 50s and Eisenhower and the rest of it I followed
[03:07.720 --> 03:11.480]  very closely it's we've always owned it maybe the trigger for World War 3 as
[03:11.480 --> 03:15.200]  Lindsay Williams sources said Middle East is a distraction it's important but
[03:15.200 --> 03:19.960]  watch China North Korea this is talked about it this is the real trigger and I
[03:19.960 --> 03:25.000]  respect Scousen but he could be wrong this this trigger could come sooner
[03:25.000 --> 03:28.360]  rather than later I think this probably is insane rhetoric to get more oil and
[03:28.360 --> 03:32.320]  food but the point is is that Kim Jong-un is completely out of his mind is
[03:32.320 --> 03:36.960]  absolutely and China's rebuking him right now and that's really unprecedented
[03:36.960 --> 03:41.560]  North Korea yesterday last night when we talked had just issued their own
[03:41.560 --> 03:45.680]  Fadoa North Korea approved nuclear strike on the United States says they're
[03:45.680 --> 03:51.680]  preparing and they also say they have frogs or short-range tactical nuclear
[03:51.680 --> 03:55.280]  weapons that they're going to use and we know that Russia has been involved with
[03:55.280 --> 04:00.680]  them decades ago they may have frogs or they may be used or they may be pushed
[04:00.680 --> 04:04.360]  by China that a higher level is working with the Illuminati and the globalist
[04:04.360 --> 04:08.920]  again China isn't run by the US it's run by the New World Order and the
[04:08.920 --> 04:13.840]  Communists just like we are right okay or the oligarchs who use communism it's
[04:13.840 --> 04:18.800]  really a eugenics state communism is just a label a slave state and so the
[04:18.800 --> 04:25.640]  fact that Donald Rumsfeld helped help transfer in 1996 the ABB reactors from
[04:25.640 --> 04:29.080]  Switzerland that could build fissile material or produce fissile material for
[04:29.080 --> 04:33.160]  a bombs the fact that Laurel and Hughes through China helped give them the ICBM
[04:33.160 --> 04:38.280]  technology the globalist have armed North Korea for this role is it coming
[04:38.280 --> 04:42.480]  early we always said they'd break out with a giant war as rank corporation
[04:42.480 --> 04:46.520]  called for during the economic collapse show we have this heats up you know the
[04:46.520 --> 04:49.000]  the economic collapses around the corner Mike and they're specifically
[04:49.000 --> 04:53.200]  threatening to nuke Austin by the way another interesting twist to their their
[04:53.200 --> 04:56.600]  litany of threats this is the Alex Jones show we'll be right back with Alex
[04:56.600 --> 05:00.120]  and other guests straight ahead stay with us right here we'll be right back
[05:00.120 --> 05:04.360]  with all this and more prepare by purchasing gold food and firearms but
[05:04.360 --> 05:07.960]  if you don't have a home security system then you're missing a critical weapon

[07:10.760 --> 07:15.960]  as well as key vitamins and as soon as I had that I immediately could eat half of

[08:07.440 --> 08:13.240]  resistance you're listening to the alex jones show
[08:18.240 --> 08:23.320]  welcome to the alex jones show on this thursday april 4th 2013 as the nation
[08:23.320 --> 08:26.920]  stands on the verge of potential war at least the threat of war this is all
[08:26.920 --> 08:30.920]  breaking news and special reports here on the alex jones show alex is in studio
[08:30.920 --> 08:35.640]  and will be delivering that special information here in just one minute we've
[08:35.640 --> 08:39.280]  got missile defense systems being sent to guam now the united states is taking
[08:39.280 --> 08:43.680]  these threats seriously as north korea's psycho leader kim jong-un says
[08:43.680 --> 08:47.800]  he's going to nuke america including cities like awesome alex is here with
[08:47.800 --> 08:51.440]  special reports to give us a breakdown of what's happening and then we'll have
[08:51.440 --> 08:55.160]  guests on at the bottom of this hour and the next hour but let's go right to
[08:55.160 --> 08:59.200]  alex with the latest on north korea absolutely mike thank you here's just
[08:59.200 --> 09:04.640]  some of the headlines and this is unprecedented in the 60 years since the
[09:04.640 --> 09:09.480]  armistice was signed at the end of the korean war this is unprecedented this
[09:09.480 --> 09:13.400]  type of rhetoric and even though it may be rhetoric and we hope it's rhetoric
[09:13.400 --> 09:18.240]  this is unprecedented there are criminal globalist forces that manipulate the
[09:18.240 --> 09:23.240]  u.s. europe china and are pushing them all towards an authoritarian system our
[09:23.240 --> 09:28.080]  governments trying to adopt chinese style policies of one child an internet
[09:28.080 --> 09:32.320]  censorship and kill switches and that's because the globalist went in and put
[09:32.320 --> 09:35.760]  mouse a tongue in power and the reason I talk about china when I talk about north
[09:35.760 --> 09:41.680]  korea is because the new world order controls and manipulates the communist
[09:41.680 --> 09:45.520]  chinese regime to a great level so the new world order steers and controls
[09:45.520 --> 09:50.920]  china and china steers and controls to the great extent the puppet state the
[09:50.920 --> 09:56.760]  kamikaze state of north korea the Stalinist state that literally is the
[09:56.760 --> 10:00.960]  most oppressive probably in world history and certainly the most
[10:00.960 --> 10:06.280]  illusion and it's important to add that a bb was headed up in 1996 by donald
[10:06.280 --> 10:11.720]  rumsfeld who got authorization from bill clinton and also the united nations to
[10:11.720 --> 10:18.600]  transfer reactor types that can be be easily used to build and and create the
[10:18.600 --> 10:25.320]  fissile material for atomic bombs so I'm giving people some backstory here that
[10:25.320 --> 10:28.640]  we've always known that north korea is the real trigger to look at not even the
[10:28.640 --> 10:33.360]  middle east for a true war new world war and remember two years ago rand
[10:33.360 --> 10:39.280]  corporation said we need a global war to smoke screen the economic implosion to
[10:39.280 --> 10:43.080]  get people to rally behind all their governments from china to europe to the
[10:43.080 --> 10:47.640]  united states to england to australia especially so that everyone will get
[10:47.640 --> 10:50.960]  behind their governments during this crisis so but that that's the key is
[10:50.960 --> 10:54.320]  that that the new world order can use this I'm sorry interrupt but they can
[10:54.320 --> 10:59.200]  use this outbreak of war to then unleash the economic collapse to for
[10:59.200 --> 11:02.440]  example call in the dollar if they wanted to replace it with another
[11:02.440 --> 11:06.520]  currency exactly rip everybody off who's got savings do what cypress did war is
[11:06.520 --> 11:10.400]  the health of the state absolutely so all of our experts including you
[11:10.400 --> 11:15.240]  your old slant a myself all of them have concurred that when they start the real
[11:15.240 --> 11:18.200]  global meltdown they're going to start huge wars and there are a lot in the
[11:18.200 --> 11:21.560]  Middle East up for that putting al-qaeda in everywhere and then we'll be
[11:21.560 --> 11:26.280]  conspiracy theorist when we hold up AP Reuters you know a year from now two years
[11:26.280 --> 11:29.960]  from now there's a giant war in the Middle East there's already proxy wars
[11:29.960 --> 11:32.960]  and we'll say look the government put al-qaeda in and they'll say how dare you
[11:32.960 --> 11:37.320]  traitor say that when our men are dying fighting them go ahead like well do you
[11:37.320 --> 11:41.160]  believe it now we know that North Korea has nuclear bombs they've been testing
[11:41.160 --> 11:44.280]  them they just tested one I think in December right they've been testing
[11:44.280 --> 11:47.360]  long-range cruise missiles but do you think do you believe that they have the
[11:47.360 --> 11:51.200]  ability to put the nuclear warheads on the missiles yet that can reach America
[11:51.200 --> 11:55.160]  we don't know China could use them as a proxy the Russians we know worked with
[11:55.160 --> 11:59.000]  them decades ago the Russian borders actually very close to North Korea they
[11:59.000 --> 12:02.840]  have a railway system that goes in and out of North Korea but again the
[12:02.840 --> 12:07.360]  globalist could be using the Chinese to give orders to Kim Jong-un to act like
[12:07.360 --> 12:10.640]  this saying oh you're gonna get your food and oil like you always do doing
[12:10.640 --> 12:13.680]  this but this rhetoric is probably three four times what's ever been and then
[12:13.680 --> 12:18.000]  they could do a false flag right and then say they did it start World War
[12:18.000 --> 12:22.480]  three the the US government or the globalist the criminal elements rogue
[12:22.480 --> 12:27.480]  elements criminal elements yes nuke a US city and blame North Korea saying North
[12:27.480 --> 12:30.200]  Korea brought in suitcase nukes or something like that our government's
[12:30.200 --> 12:33.240]  been digging in like there's gonna be a total collapse in America and they're
[12:33.240 --> 12:36.640]  gonna have war with the people they'll then use that as a smoke screen to go
[12:36.640 --> 12:40.040]  after us or they may just stage terror attacks and blame it on patriot groups I
[12:40.040 --> 12:43.400]  mean White House advisors have said that we'll have a new Oklahoma City and
[12:43.400 --> 12:46.960]  blame it on you one micron from admitting they did it and remember the
[12:46.960 --> 12:50.360]  current attorney general was the deputy attorney general with Oklahoma City and
[12:50.360 --> 12:54.000]  the emails came out in lawsuits about how he was covering it up now let's stop
[12:54.000 --> 12:57.640]  right there let me get people the headlines North Korea moves missiles
[12:57.640 --> 13:04.080]  with inconsiderable range to East Coast here is another headline North Korea
[13:04.080 --> 13:10.520]  AFP approves nuclear strike on United States and says prepare for the missiles
[13:10.520 --> 13:15.200]  to hit you now I know the globalist are evil and they'd like us to live like
[13:15.200 --> 13:20.000]  North Koreans so I'm not saying hey we're good North Korea is bad globalist
[13:20.000 --> 13:24.040]  are manipulating this but listen under international law common law the fact
[13:24.040 --> 13:27.320]  that he says we're aiming missiles prepare for him to go off we're he said
[13:27.320 --> 13:30.960]  quote we're going to hit you prepare for the explosions they should be hit right
[13:30.960 --> 13:33.240]  there absolutely they should be I mean if somebody comes to my house and says
[13:33.240 --> 13:36.800]  yeah I've got a gun I'm about to shoot you I've got a right to kill you so I'm
[13:36.800 --> 13:39.960]  telling you right now that they should use all the space planes with the DU
[13:39.960 --> 13:46.080]  sabos to decapitate him yeah and by the way I'm sure those yeah so but listen
[13:46.080 --> 13:49.280]  that's not happening they're going to let them whether it's this year or two
[13:49.280 --> 13:52.200]  years from now and I agree with Joel Scowles and maybe five years from now
[13:52.200 --> 13:57.640]  they're going to start World War three with this little preacher so so what
[13:57.640 --> 14:02.160]  about so he's being manipulated possibly but he's also and the globalist gave
[14:02.160 --> 14:07.160]  him the the atomic bomb material right right they got primitive weapons what
[14:07.160 --> 14:11.480]  about internal pressures in North Korea is Kim Jong-un being forced into a
[14:11.480 --> 14:16.040]  radicalization of his own policy because of his own military wanting him to be
[14:16.040 --> 14:20.440]  strong or be overthrown well that's part of it and but I mean compared to his
[14:20.440 --> 14:24.440]  father or his grandfather I mean this is I mean these are quotes out in the
[14:24.440 --> 14:27.800]  official I don't just believe our media or French news agency when they say this
[14:27.800 --> 14:31.560]  I went and looked up the official and they put it out in English their
[14:31.560 --> 14:35.040]  information ministry of the Stalinist state and they said we're preparing to
[14:35.040 --> 14:39.000]  strike you prepare for the explosions now we're going to hit you and then they
[14:39.000 --> 14:42.320]  show maps with where we're sitting targeted yeah right Austin now they
[14:42.320 --> 14:47.840]  probably can't hit us with their ICBMs undoubtedly they've got DC-10s with
[14:47.840 --> 14:51.840]  chemical lasers circling 100 miles off that can shoot these down they've
[14:51.840 --> 14:54.640]  probably been shooting the ones down that they've been trying to quote launch
[14:54.640 --> 15:00.000]  over Japan so so I'm gonna say this they've had DC-10s for 20 years
[15:00.000 --> 15:05.400]  declassified that can vaporize with chemical lasers with us and the newer
[15:05.400 --> 15:09.240]  ones have cyclotrons added on to them so they're chemical weapons excuse me
[15:09.240 --> 15:12.360]  particle beams and not chemical weapons these are chemical laser yeah chemical
[15:12.360 --> 15:15.880]  with a cyclotron on top and I mean these are lasers of the whole length of the
[15:15.880 --> 15:20.680]  plane yeah right okay and so I mean the declassified stuff was vaporizing
[15:20.680 --> 15:27.000]  armored missiles you know 20 years ago so if a missile gets through okay I'm
[15:27.000 --> 15:32.160]  gonna be very suspicious because a he's got you know 1970s piece of junk type
[15:32.160 --> 15:36.200]  ICBMs nothing they build ever work the Stalin estate can't even produce
[15:36.200 --> 15:39.560]  automobiles right the globalists have given them everything they've got it's
[15:39.560 --> 15:43.720]  very hard to get one of these into orbit much less back in and so if it
[15:43.720 --> 15:47.600]  doesn't get shot down the globalists have some explaining to do but they could
[15:47.600 --> 15:54.120]  put a portable nuke a suitcase nuke on a container shipping out of South Korea to
[15:54.120 --> 15:57.920]  for example the port of Seattle and they could detonate it well that's the new
[15:57.920 --> 16:02.880]  real threat and so instead of boarding Syrian craft and Russian craft who are
[16:02.880 --> 16:06.480]  getting small arms to protect themselves you know against Al Qaeda which our
[16:06.480 --> 16:09.640]  government's doing you know they're boarding those to stop even machine guns
[16:09.640 --> 16:14.280]  being shipped to Syria all North Korean vessels should be boarded everywhere
[16:14.280 --> 16:17.200]  right I mean they shouldn't even be allowed to leave their port because as
[16:17.200 --> 16:20.680]  you said that's the new threat associated press they're saying they have small
[16:20.680 --> 16:25.680]  tacticals that can be delivered in unconventional ways IE barges and they
[16:25.680 --> 16:31.240]  ship goods into South Korea and into North and into China which actually come
[16:31.240 --> 16:35.680]  here so I'm calling for an embargo of all Chinese goods because you can't trust
[16:35.680 --> 16:40.040]  these containers that's a good point that's a really good point also the
[16:40.040 --> 16:44.760]  false flag element again the globalists could detonate a nuke in a container 10
[16:44.760 --> 16:48.360]  miles off the coast of Oregon or Washington or Long Beach just get into
[16:48.360 --> 16:51.720]  the port doesn't even search them and then they could say well that's the excuse
[16:51.720 --> 16:56.320]  it's martial law that's it hammer comes down that's it and and by the way then
[16:56.320 --> 17:00.680]  you can't buy bullets guns magazines food anything I want to explain something
[17:00.680 --> 17:05.880]  about Kim Jong-un and ill and all these other demons they on record kidnap
[17:05.880 --> 17:11.120]  stars of South Korea and Japan and they have B movie stars and C movie stars
[17:11.120 --> 17:15.880]  flying it's not just Dennis Rodman to service them and they've got all sorts
[17:15.880 --> 17:21.080]  of you know torture palaces I mean these are incarnate what the globalists
[17:21.080 --> 17:26.200]  would love to be yeah I mean this is their agenda 21 plan total deindustrialization
[17:26.200 --> 17:32.640]  total hell tiny subcompact cities that have power the rest of country dark the
[17:32.640 --> 17:36.760]  public literally living in like the 15th century the people there don't even
[17:36.760 --> 17:42.000]  know what planets are on basically well I thought you're describing Austin just
[17:42.000 --> 17:45.040]  there for a second I think I think he won't nuke Austin because that's his
[17:45.040 --> 17:49.760]  fan base yeah all these sick trainees that think it's funny now shifting years
[17:49.760 --> 17:53.240]  to the target interjection no no you're absolutely right topic shifting gears
[17:53.240 --> 17:56.680]  here to something I want to talk about the alternative media is under attack
[17:56.680 --> 17:59.520]  because we are the real media and we come back from break I want to go to this
[17:59.520 --> 18:02.160]  clip and then you can get on to your next guest gonna give a lot of important
[18:02.160 --> 18:05.440]  stuff to cover I'll be back at the start of the next hour with updates we got the
[18:05.440 --> 18:09.040]  special report at the start of the third hour on them denying there's a new world
[18:09.040 --> 18:12.240]  order and we're gonna show some clips of that and if anything else happens in
[18:12.240 --> 18:16.080]  the meantime you'll be here immediately to break it down absolutely and put
[18:16.080 --> 18:19.040]  people call everybody you know tell them to tune in because because here's the
[18:19.040 --> 18:25.720]  message here's the message the drudge report is at the very top of the
[18:25.720 --> 18:29.320]  Liberty pyramid not to use an Illuminati term that's just that that's how they
[18:29.320 --> 18:33.840]  look at it yeah at the very top is is Matt drudge and drudge report.com
[18:33.840 --> 18:39.360]  okay if they can take him down or if they can demonize him or if they can
[18:39.360 --> 18:42.320]  discredit that site which all it does is link to a wide spectrum of news
[18:42.320 --> 18:46.040]  mainstream alternative government documents our stuff everything if they
[18:46.040 --> 18:50.040]  can take him down it's not just that it has the most traffic of any news website
[18:50.040 --> 18:56.600]  in the world it's that it's setting the agenda I've been in newsrooms CNN Fox
[18:56.600 --> 19:01.040]  talk radio you see it on the news all the time in the background is drudge yeah
[19:01.040 --> 19:06.640]  because they're so unimaginative drudge has a real pulse on what a normal guy
[19:06.640 --> 19:10.280]  who loves liberty is into that's what you see there his his team of a couple
[19:10.280 --> 19:14.200]  guys okay they know what's real they know what's important they've got a six
[19:14.200 --> 19:18.280]  cents they they're really smart and and so so all they're doing is linking to a
[19:18.280 --> 19:22.160]  wide spectrum of news and it scares the White House that they don't control the
[19:22.160 --> 19:27.080]  narrative because they run ABC NBC CBS their blackmailing Fox right now with
[19:27.080 --> 19:30.640]  the phone hacking stuff with Justice Department investigations you see the
[19:30.640 --> 19:33.280]  media matters run by the White House saying they're gonna bring down alternative
[19:33.280 --> 19:37.080]  media they want to get into all our organizations and destroy us they're on
[19:37.080 --> 19:42.800]  record so now the senior White House guy has said quote the drudge report hurts
[19:42.800 --> 19:45.840]  what we're trying to do but what I'm explaining is when you get to the
[19:45.840 --> 19:50.240]  resistance the fact is we're in the fight the drudge report info wars dot

[24:19.960 --> 24:22.560]  minutes to the next hour with the latest info on North Korea they are
[24:22.560 --> 24:25.520]  threatening to nuke and not just threatening saying prepare for the
[24:25.520 --> 24:31.360]  detonations and our government and the globalist as usual gave them all the
[24:31.360 --> 24:34.440]  weapons just like they're putting al-Qaeda in charge and now they're going to use
[24:34.440 --> 24:38.480]  this threat to take our liberty now in the backdrop of this I've explained to
[24:38.480 --> 24:43.080]  people I've had the Winehouse directly respond to us repeatedly on the Pierce
[24:43.080 --> 24:47.000]  Morgan petition on how they're trying to shut down coal power plants saying I'm
[24:47.000 --> 24:52.240]  crazy that was Carney that responded I've had them respond to me many times
[24:52.240 --> 24:57.080]  directly but hundreds of times through their surrogate media matters which is
[24:57.080 --> 25:01.440]  publicly run by their former transition chief and is a saboteur group in their
[25:01.440 --> 25:05.920]  own words they say we will get hired trade we will infiltrate politicos
[25:05.920 --> 25:11.360]  basically another group so all of this is going on my point to listeners is we
[25:11.360 --> 25:15.520]  need your prayers we need your financial support we need to be big and strong we
[25:15.520 --> 25:18.960]  need you to spread the word about drudgereport.com info wars.com
[25:18.960 --> 25:24.400]  naturalnews.com worldnetdaily.com I'd say news batch but it kind of faded off I
[25:24.400 --> 25:29.320]  mean you know all these groups because because look drudge isn't perfect I'm
[25:29.320 --> 25:32.440]  not perfect all of us disagree with stuff I disagree with some stuff a day
[25:32.440 --> 25:36.400]  after I say it in hindsight or how I said it the point is ladies and gentlemen
[25:36.400 --> 25:41.520]  little Alex Jones little Matt drudge little Mike Adams I mean sure we're big
[25:41.520 --> 25:44.760]  big hearts we love liberty but we're little guys yeah we're individuals we're
[25:44.760 --> 25:50.280]  individuals we but this is an example to the power you have that the head
[25:50.280 --> 25:54.600]  White House advisor the head this is the real president this is the this is
[25:54.600 --> 25:58.480]  above Carl Rove under Bush you know this is what's loaded in the teleprompter's
[25:58.480 --> 26:04.360]  what Obama does okay says quote drudge hurts what we're trying to do which is
[26:04.360 --> 26:07.880]  the control and disinform yeah and folks by the way they killed Breitbart I mean
[26:07.880 --> 26:10.800]  I mean there's undoubtedly the way they did everything listen they could kill me
[26:10.800 --> 26:14.200]  tomorrow okay and we tell we need it if anything happens to drudge you need to
[26:14.200 --> 26:18.000]  know which it's not as we're talking about it but this isn't a game okay okay I
[26:18.000 --> 26:21.440]  get death threats at home where they tell me what my wife was talking about on
[26:21.440 --> 26:25.480]  the phone with her dad okay this is real okay so I want to you know get this
[26:25.480 --> 26:28.800]  through your head let's go ahead and play this clip here he is on c-span this is
[26:28.800 --> 26:32.440]  up on info wars dot com right now it rolled off drudge this is like talking
[26:32.440 --> 26:36.480]  about himself but I'm gonna this is on info wars dot com right now business
[26:36.480 --> 26:40.880]  insider this is him talking about drudge and how it's dangerous they've got to
[26:40.880 --> 26:45.440]  have an iron fist of control because they can't control the media and what
[26:45.440 --> 26:50.040]  they do might get by picked up by drudge and you know he's discredited though he
[26:50.040 --> 26:54.520]  has no power when all drudge will do is show what they said it's why he's so
[26:54.520 --> 26:59.400]  powerful is the ultimate he just he just shows what they did yeah he doesn't
[26:59.400 --> 27:03.560]  even know what he ever sees him or hears him it's them right he just shows them
[27:03.560 --> 27:07.640]  going we're gonna get your guns once we get these registered I'm gonna take them
[27:07.640 --> 27:11.120]  all drudge links our article drudge doesn't even write in his own articles
[27:11.120 --> 27:15.200]  he just links it's like look this is what they said and they're scared of that
[27:15.200 --> 27:18.360]  because they want it in their context can't control he's breaking the
[27:18.360 --> 27:21.960]  electronic Berlin wall he's the biggest hole in their wall drudge has no boss
[27:21.960 --> 27:26.160]  that's it and no investors look look how globalist control groups have bought
[27:26.160 --> 27:29.480]  up the company that rush limbaugh is under yep look at how they've done and
[27:29.480 --> 27:32.240]  I know they're putting pressure on him and others I know the inside scoop I
[27:32.240 --> 27:35.560]  mean let me tell you we're totally independent like drudge exactly there is
[27:35.560 --> 27:40.080]  not much out there folks and listen you better appreciate this okay let's go
[27:40.080 --> 27:43.720]  ahead and go to this clip here is this there's not the idea of iron fisted
[27:43.720 --> 27:47.040]  control gives us a lot more credit than we deserve I think the fact of the
[27:47.040 --> 27:52.280]  matter is is that in this day and age people are more cautious about talking
[27:52.280 --> 28:00.280]  because the there is a tendency to you know for some of the press to be a
[28:00.280 --> 28:04.520]  sort of on 24 hour gas patrol and so you know if you're an undersecretary at the
[28:04.520 --> 28:07.640]  energy department and you're doing interview and you say one thing you know
[28:07.640 --> 28:13.000]  during you could end up being on the front page of drudge being you guys
[28:13.000 --> 28:18.920]  love drudge I'm not the only one up here and why why does it drive
[28:18.920 --> 28:22.960]  conversation in your world the way it seems to wait it's not it doesn't it's
[28:22.960 --> 28:25.720]  not that it drives our conversation in our world I'm fairly ambivalent to what
[28:25.720 --> 28:29.520]  drugs but it doesn't mean I'm gonna have to come back I know you got your

[28:50.120 --> 28:53.720]  link to the filibuster of Rand Paul right when the media was gonna ignore it
[28:53.720 --> 28:57.920]  and then it breaks big or they will keep linking to the bullet story that said

[33:11.800 --> 33:16.000]  Alex Jones in studio go ahead Alex what's on your mind now it's just we're
[33:16.000 --> 33:18.440]  chomping into bed here you were just telling me during the break you're
[33:18.440 --> 33:24.320]  going we really are it and it's creepy to know the White House daily is attacking
[33:24.320 --> 33:29.320]  me by name through their surrogates but also sometimes by name yeah and I was
[33:29.320 --> 33:32.120]  talking about yeah you know they tried to buy me out before tried to give me
[33:32.120 --> 33:36.840]  these big offers you were just offered glenbeck level money I mean we're talking
[33:36.840 --> 33:40.800]  you know upwards of 10 million bucks to sell out to the New World Order you've
[33:40.800 --> 33:43.520]  been offered national TV shows cuz let's face it you're a lot better looking
[33:43.520 --> 33:48.080]  than I am and just as articulate I mean you you're a star Mike Adams but you're
[33:48.080 --> 33:52.960]  not trying to be a star you have moved out here in Texas you've got your factory
[33:52.960 --> 33:57.160]  you've got 50 caliber rifles you want the spirit of liberty I don't have 50
[33:57.160 --> 34:01.280]  caliber rifles I have I have mud on my pants look at this I was you do you
[34:01.280 --> 34:05.680]  brought yours in here everybody knows that I'm gonna anyways let's just get
[34:05.680 --> 34:09.160]  back to what I was saying the point is we want liberty yeah that's what we want
[34:09.160 --> 34:13.000]  we want destiny and freedom and they just don't know how to deal with that and
[34:13.000 --> 34:16.880]  so it's estimated the drudge report could sell for probably 300 million
[34:16.880 --> 34:20.360]  dollars but it would just be worthless in a month if it wasn't that right
[34:20.360 --> 34:24.280]  running it I mean none of us can sell out because we're not doing this for
[34:24.280 --> 34:27.720]  money and what would you even do with the money the minute you have let's say
[34:27.720 --> 34:30.920]  you had ten million dollars in your bank account what would be the point of
[34:30.920 --> 34:33.880]  having it especially when they're gonna collapse the money supply anyway they're
[34:33.880 --> 34:36.960]  they're eroding it every day but even if you had the money what would you want
[34:36.960 --> 34:40.840]  to do you want to start what we're doing now to tell the fight but but here's the
[34:40.840 --> 34:43.320]  paradox I'm gonna play this clip and get out of here for your guests it's
[34:43.320 --> 34:45.920]  waiting to come in and I'll be back for 20 minutes the next hour ahead of your
[34:45.920 --> 34:51.520]  next guest Mike Adams it comes down to this there I love my children even if I
[34:51.520 --> 34:54.160]  was an evil person I would be against the New World Order because it's gonna
[34:54.160 --> 34:57.040]  be destructive of humanity right I'm not stupid but I happen to be a person
[34:57.040 --> 35:02.000]  that loves liberty and loves freedom but the issue is for viewers instead here I
[35:02.000 --> 35:07.040]  am turning down even more than what Mike was talking about over the years I mean
[35:07.040 --> 35:10.400]  Mike's the real deal I mean I mean he's had major computer company software
[35:10.400 --> 35:14.280]  publishing all over the world he doesn't brag about how big he is I don't really
[35:14.280 --> 35:18.480]  talk about how big we are but I'm literally here selling color magazines at
[35:18.480 --> 35:22.520]  cost trying to get the word out I'm here saying please buy propure water filters
[35:22.520 --> 35:26.920]  from us at costs at info or store.com with promo code water to just be able
[35:26.920 --> 35:32.280]  to spend six and a half million dollars a year and spend 90 plus percent of the
[35:32.280 --> 35:36.280]  money that comes in here to run this operation and then have some backup
[35:36.280 --> 35:40.880]  cash I could snap my fingers and have 50 million dollars in here but I'd have to
[35:40.880 --> 35:44.560]  kneel to soar on exactly I would no longer be who I was so it's not even
[35:44.560 --> 35:49.240]  hard to turn it down but it's frustrating to even like not be able to
[35:49.240 --> 35:52.720]  compromise a little to get a sponsor to fund things to be moral is really hard
[35:52.720 --> 35:57.480]  so so my point is there we have the White House coming after us we have all
[35:57.480 --> 36:01.320]  this stuff going on if you would just buy the books the videos the tapes be our
[36:01.320 --> 36:07.520]  sponsors support us you're buying war bonds literally with soldiers in the gap
[36:07.520 --> 36:12.680]  facing the entire New World Order we're it everybody else sold out everybody else
[36:12.680 --> 36:16.640]  got killed everybody else got destroyed I mean I'm telling you folks we are
[36:16.640 --> 36:21.680]  front line Alamo with the enemy climbing over we're swinging muskets you
[36:21.680 --> 36:25.080]  know I'm running towards the powder room ladies and gentlemen okay with bullets
[36:25.080 --> 36:29.480]  already in my back I mean and I'm telling you up front Colonel Travis is
[36:29.480 --> 36:33.480]  Matt Rudge right up there at the front folks make no mistake he's wearing the
[36:33.480 --> 36:37.440]  you know the Colonel hat okay I mean the point is that's who everybody's gonna
[36:37.440 --> 36:40.320]  be gunning for and if they can actually they got when they first you know
[36:40.320 --> 36:44.040]  finally took over at the Alamo so what you've got to understand here ladies and
[36:44.040 --> 36:46.800]  gentlemen is we don't ever explain to people that the
[36:46.800 --> 36:51.040]  incredibleness of how big this is right make your point we'll play this video
[36:51.040 --> 36:56.280]  well imagine the world without Matt Drudge and info wars you'd be getting
[36:56.280 --> 37:00.800]  nothing but fake fabricated CNN type of spin like remember they did the Charles
[37:00.800 --> 37:07.400]  Jacob fake Middle East set back in the first Gulf War it was a shame no no no and
[37:07.400 --> 37:11.080]  listen once they get rid of us everyone else follows they admit that that's
[37:11.080 --> 37:15.120]  right gonna shut the whole web down yep we we hang together or we hang
[37:15.120 --> 37:19.960]  separate that's it go ahead no no I want your guest to get in here here is the
[37:19.960 --> 37:26.400]  clip of the senior head White House advisor the lead advisor to Obama yeah
[37:26.400 --> 37:29.080]  this is the globalist go and tell what to do and what to load the teleprompter
[37:29.080 --> 37:34.640]  says the drudge hurts what we're trying to do again we're the and what's on
[37:34.640 --> 37:40.560]  drudge report.com info wars.com natural news.com but also he'll link to what
[37:40.560 --> 37:44.600]  North Korea said he'll link to what the BBC said it's getting you outside the
[37:44.600 --> 37:48.360]  bubble of what the corporate globalist media force feeds you were you tuned to
[37:48.360 --> 37:51.280]  the channels and it's all the same thing in the same order okay let's go ahead
[37:51.280 --> 37:56.640]  and go to this clip now from C-SPAN where I already knew this already told you
[37:56.640 --> 38:00.560]  this but here they are admitting they're scared to let any other people talk
[38:00.560 --> 38:04.920]  about anything because they're scared of drudge they're scared of you they're
[38:04.920 --> 38:09.680]  scared of you getting what they say unfiltered here it is. There's not the
[38:09.680 --> 38:13.040]  idea of iron fisted control gives us a lot more credit than we deserve I
[38:13.040 --> 38:18.480]  think the fact of the matter is is that in this day and age people are more
[38:18.480 --> 38:27.040]  cautious about talking because the there is a tendency to you know for some of
[38:27.040 --> 38:30.120]  the press to be a sort of 24-hour gas patrol. They don't can tell an era that
[38:30.120 --> 38:33.320]  you're right undersecretary at the energy department and you're doing
[38:33.320 --> 38:37.320]  interview and you say one thing you know during if you could end up that you
[38:37.320 --> 38:43.160]  slipped out of drudge being. You guys love drudge. I'm not the only one up here.
[38:43.160 --> 38:48.400]  Why does it drive conversation in your world the way it seems to
[38:48.400 --> 38:51.520]  do? Well it's not it doesn't it's not that it drives our conversation in our
[38:51.520 --> 38:54.440]  world I'm fairly ambivalent to what drudge puts up on a daily basis but it
[38:54.440 --> 38:57.960]  there's a it's let this is less true now than it was before but there's a
[38:57.960 --> 39:03.880]  Pavlovian. Total lie. Response from. Totally obsessive. It's on media outlets it's like
[39:03.880 --> 39:07.640]  why are you asking me about this well it's on drudge you know and so it's you
[39:07.640 --> 39:11.400]  know in some cases. What do you say to that? I sort of bit and I sort of bit ask
[39:11.400 --> 39:14.160]  me to repeat them you know say that to themselves out loud again and think about
[39:14.160 --> 39:17.520]  it. Say that out loud. You know and everyone's a little embarrassed about it
[39:17.520 --> 39:20.080]  it's always like my boss you know my assignment editor is on me about this
[39:20.080 --> 39:29.600]  and so the example being that you you know that anyone saying anything can can
[39:29.600 --> 39:34.200]  get caught up in in the spin cycle. In the real media okay that's enough for that
[39:34.200 --> 39:37.680]  garbage full clip up at info wars.com it's already rolled off drudge at least
[39:37.680 --> 39:39.760]  when I look during the break maybe we'll move it back to the top I know he
[39:39.760 --> 39:43.840]  listens but but but imagine we say it's creepy can you imagine being met drudge
[39:43.840 --> 39:46.920]  how creepy that is I mean looking over your coming you know believe me as you
[39:46.920 --> 39:52.120]  imagine stuff he goes through so the point is is that folks we're really
[39:52.120 --> 39:55.720]  walking point here and I'm not asking for you to admire us just pray for us and
[39:55.720 --> 39:58.640]  support us because believe me we're walking to the valley of the shadow of
[39:58.640 --> 40:03.360]  death we fear no evil but we fear not getting our mission completed and notice
[40:03.360 --> 40:08.080]  you know they're saying oh we ridicule he's telling people ridicule media when
[40:08.080 --> 40:11.960]  they go hey diane feinstein says the goal is to ban all our guns once they're
[40:11.960 --> 40:17.040]  registered here's her video clip oh don't answer that question laugh at them
[40:17.040 --> 40:20.720]  you know laugh at charlton hesson in the grave like like like we're peer
[40:20.720 --> 40:25.640]  pressure driven and when MSNBC's top shows have a million viewers seeing in
[40:25.640 --> 40:29.760]  900,000 usually a half million that there's there's a million people
[40:29.760 --> 40:34.400]  conservatively listening right now okay and my shows maybe number nine number
[40:34.400 --> 40:37.880]  eight in talk radio there shows with 10 million listing rush limbaugh right now
[40:37.880 --> 40:42.720]  I mean these people are trying to buy us out they're trying to take over limbaugh
[40:42.720 --> 40:45.920]  and not that he's perfect but if they can shut us down it's over I want you to
[40:45.920 --> 40:48.760]  bring in your next guest and I'm sorry for cutting his time and very important
[40:48.760 --> 40:52.600]  information but but Mike again this is an important point in history they're
[40:52.600 --> 40:56.800]  not going to let you realize how important all of us are you are spreading
[40:56.800 --> 41:01.680]  the word they hate the fact that we now are controlling the narrative with the
[41:01.680 --> 41:05.960]  truth and they want to ridicule us for it when this scum traders criminals
[41:05.960 --> 41:09.640]  ridicule us they're doing criminal stuff when they ridicule us that's a badge of
[41:09.640 --> 41:12.960]  honor these are the globalist occupiers who think they're gonna come in here and
[41:12.960 --> 41:16.520]  laugh at us and say oh we're not trying to take your guns there's no bullets
[41:16.520 --> 41:21.520]  there's no armored vehicles there's no GMO it doesn't work anymore scum it
[41:21.520 --> 41:25.960]  doesn't work anymore and we see you like the two billion bullets story if it
[41:25.960 --> 41:30.440]  wasn't for drudge and info wars that story never would your info wars breaks
[41:30.440 --> 41:34.160]  it drudge goes and looks it's real starts putting it out they say he's a liar
[41:34.160 --> 41:37.000]  and they deny the bullets and then that discredits them because we just keep
[41:37.000 --> 41:39.840]  hammering them because we're bigger than them and it's real they're they're
[41:39.840 --> 41:43.600]  acting like they're like a chihuahua that thinks you can beat up a bullmastiff
[41:43.600 --> 41:47.240]  except we're a bullmastiff that's trained to kill and we're not gonna let it
[41:47.240 --> 41:51.960]  just jump on our truth yeah yeah that's it if you report the truth they can deny
[41:51.960 --> 41:54.800]  it and deny it but eventually it comes out and then they look like the sure
[41:54.800 --> 41:58.640]  sure your lab can get beat up by a mean chihuahua because I have a lab and a
[41:58.640 --> 42:03.360]  chihuahua it's the boss yeah but if it goes up to a pit bull it's lunch and this
[42:03.360 --> 42:08.040]  chihuahua snapping at us and I'm like hey out numb you out number you up 50 to
[42:08.040 --> 42:13.600]  one I got giant teeth okay I'm not gonna listen to you yeah the White House is
[42:13.600 --> 42:21.840]  a challenge like the ravings of a fascist thank you Glenn sounds like a piece
[42:21.840 --> 42:24.960]  of garbage all right that's enough that's enough all right well see but he
[42:24.960 --> 42:28.120]  didn't like Breitbart either cuz he had his own thing see I want everybody I

[42:38.240 --> 42:40.640]  little bit in the next hour and I'll come in with like a five-minute update
[42:40.640 --> 42:44.160]  because I wanted to get his time okay all right that thank you Alex thanks for
[42:44.160 --> 42:48.360]  stepping in and also happening in the next hour Alex will be back with more
[42:48.360 --> 42:52.120]  updates because things are happening very rapidly here now here's what we're
[42:52.120 --> 43:00.600]  gonna do I guess that is joining us now is the founder of a an aquaponic slash
[43:00.600 --> 43:05.120]  hydroponic store in the Austin area not a sponsor yet he's not a sponsor yet
[43:05.120 --> 43:12.320]  yeah good point Alex no I actually found Troy Troy Smith is his name he's the
[43:12.320 --> 43:19.360]  owner of be bright ideas bright ideas be our I te bi hydro comm is the website
[43:19.360 --> 43:22.680]  and here's why this matters and here's what this has to do with all the news
[43:22.680 --> 43:28.000]  today if North Korea launches nukes or there's some kind of a false flag nuke
[43:28.000 --> 43:33.160]  attack or some other excuse for the system to start cracking down martial law
[43:33.160 --> 43:37.560]  you name it they're gonna control the food supply because food is a weapon in
[43:37.560 --> 43:41.480]  the hands of the government the restriction of food is a weapon now
[43:41.480 --> 43:46.280]  most of you listening out there you have you taken steps to be prepared your
[43:46.280 --> 43:50.760]  your survivors your preppers you're well informed so you probably have some
[43:50.760 --> 43:55.240]  stored food yeah you know e-foods direct as a sponsor here of the show you
[43:55.240 --> 43:59.600]  probably have firearms and ammunition and other things to keep yourself safe
[43:59.600 --> 44:04.520]  and help keep your community safe against possible looters for example but
[44:04.520 --> 44:08.640]  do you have a way to keep growing food after your e-foods direct runs out
[44:08.640 --> 44:13.640]  because it's a finite supply and you can't buy an infinite supply but an
[44:13.640 --> 44:19.200]  aquaponics system is a self replicating decentralized food production
[44:19.200 --> 44:23.880]  technology that I believe is now starting to make huge waves in the
[44:23.880 --> 44:29.160]  preparedness movement the Patriot movement survivors but also the
[44:29.160 --> 44:32.640]  progressives are into it because you could grow your own herbal medicine you
[44:32.640 --> 44:37.080]  grow fish and food in the same system and here to tell us more about it is
[44:37.080 --> 44:41.440]  Troy Smith the owner of Bright Ideas welcome to the show Troy whoa thank you
[44:41.440 --> 44:44.760]  get a little closer to your mic there all right all right well thanks for
[44:44.760 --> 44:49.800]  coming in so tell us first of all what is the level of increased interest you're
[44:49.800 --> 44:55.560]  seeing right now in aquaponics right now Mike it's really blowing up last two
[44:55.560 --> 45:00.800]  years it's really increased and last year it's exponentially has just really
[45:00.800 --> 45:06.480]  blown up mainstream customers we've got people from old ladies to micro farms
[45:06.480 --> 45:11.400]  that are now doing aquaponics it's really really popular now for those who
[45:11.400 --> 45:14.760]  may not be familiar with what aquaponics really means why this technology is so
[45:14.760 --> 45:19.760]  crucial for our survival really can you just briefly explain what the
[45:19.760 --> 45:24.800]  system is and why it's so amazing that it needs no soil uses almost no water and
[45:24.800 --> 45:30.320]  so on right well you're talking about a reservoir that's got fish the fish are
[45:30.320 --> 45:34.160]  producing the fertilizer their fish poop is actually the fertilizer for the
[45:34.160 --> 45:41.440]  plants the water is irrigated to the beds media beds is some of the ways that
[45:41.440 --> 45:46.080]  people grow there's several different types of styles you can grow in the way
[45:46.080 --> 45:51.360]  that we like to describe for people to grow is in the media beds using a
[45:51.360 --> 45:56.840]  flood and drain system when the water reaches the beds we fortify the beds
[45:56.840 --> 46:02.680]  with biology with all types of microbes bacteria and fungi and that breaks down
[46:02.680 --> 46:06.720]  the fish poop fish poop is ammonia it's break breaking down from by the
[46:06.720 --> 46:11.840]  bacteria to nitrates or for nitrites then into nitrates which is now plant
[46:11.840 --> 46:15.860]  food right the plants suck that up that clarifies the water and then that
[46:15.860 --> 46:19.360]  recirculates back to the fish so let me let me break this down so it's a self
[46:19.360 --> 46:23.680]  cleaning system it's cleaning the fish tank because normally if people grow
[46:23.680 --> 46:28.400]  fish let's say aquaculture they have a problem with fish waste and it's correct
[46:28.400 --> 46:32.680]  if they grow just plants hydroponics they have a problem with not having enough
[46:32.680 --> 46:36.400]  nutrients and then salt accumulation in the hydroponic solutions that's true
[46:36.400 --> 46:39.600]  you have to constantly change out the water solution and aquaponics you do
[46:39.600 --> 46:43.080]  not have to do that so if you combine these two fish and plants together in
[46:43.080 --> 46:48.440]  the same system they clean and nourish each other that's right it's energy that
[46:48.440 --> 46:52.800]  works together and the bacteria are crucial absolutely the biology is
[46:52.800 --> 46:56.000]  something that you want to encourage that's what gets the system going and
[46:56.000 --> 46:59.040]  that's what keeps it going so a lot of people out there may have experimented
[46:59.040 --> 47:02.520]  with hydroponics and they they know that's that can be pretty tedious they
[47:02.520 --> 47:07.440]  have to put in chemicals put in you know fertilizers and exchange water all
[47:07.440 --> 47:11.360]  the time with aquaponics you're not doing all that it seems like you're mostly
[47:11.360 --> 47:15.000]  putting in fish food for the fish and the rest of it is mostly taking care of
[47:15.000 --> 47:19.760]  itself that's right with hydroponics you're gonna spend a lot of money on
[47:19.760 --> 47:23.960]  nutrient you have to dump that nutrient solution every week it does get costly
[47:23.960 --> 47:28.960]  and that can be a problem to discard with aquaponics that water is something
[47:28.960 --> 47:33.720]  you don't want to discard you simply have to top off the reservoir weekly and
[47:33.720 --> 47:38.240]  you don't have to keep adding nutrients to the solution now people can by the
[47:38.240 --> 47:43.520]  way this is this is Troy Smith everybody from bihydro.com in Austin Texas but
[47:43.520 --> 47:48.720]  there are aquaponics retailers all over the nation and there's a great book by
[47:48.720 --> 47:53.520]  Sylvia Bernstein I believe correct on Amazon.com it's called the what's it
[47:53.520 --> 47:57.120]  called the aquaponics guide aquaponics guide that's the best book I've seen so
[47:57.120 --> 48:02.640]  far this is this is really getting very popular because you can start this even
[48:02.640 --> 48:06.800]  in an apartment correct sure yeah you can do it anywhere you could do something
[48:06.800 --> 48:11.040]  as small as a 10 gallon aquarium and a 10 by 20 seed trade just to be able to
[48:11.040 --> 48:14.440]  experiment and show that you can grow for instance lettuce something on a small
[48:14.440 --> 48:18.360]  scale yeah you can then get the confidence to move up to larger systems
[48:18.360 --> 48:22.680]  and we can help you with all that awesome awesome well I'm building
[48:22.680 --> 48:26.680]  aquaponics system and I'm gonna eventually have like a 2000 gallon fish
[48:26.680 --> 48:31.400]  tank very good and maybe eight or ten grow beds you know the Rob Nash style big
[48:31.400 --> 48:35.040]  grow beds right but here's another thing for the listeners again because of
[48:35.040 --> 48:38.040]  what's happening today North Korea threatening America with nuclear
[48:38.040 --> 48:41.560]  strikes and and Alex is gonna be jumping in with more news about that in the
[48:41.560 --> 48:47.040]  second hour by the way the world is getting crazy things that you have
[48:47.040 --> 48:51.600]  relied on are not going to be as predictable or as reliable and those
[48:51.600 --> 48:56.280]  include going to the grocery store to get your food how does that food get
[48:56.280 --> 49:02.200]  there it's driven thousands of miles on trucks using petroleum using diesel
[49:02.200 --> 49:06.880]  fuel to get it there that may not always work out so are you seeing this from a
[49:06.880 --> 49:09.760]  lot of your customers Troy of the different reasons that they're getting
[49:09.760 --> 49:13.240]  into aquaponics yeah a lot of people just want to have peace of mind of what
[49:13.240 --> 49:16.800]  they're eating a lot of people are aware of the we know what is being put on
[49:16.800 --> 49:21.080]  their table today is not wholesome foods so there's a large people a large
[49:21.080 --> 49:24.120]  amount of people are there for that reason and then of course there's a
[49:24.120 --> 49:28.920]  self-sustainability and we are about that guarding is obviously the largest
[49:28.920 --> 49:33.480]  part of self-sustainability and aquaponics is if you get off the grid
[49:33.480 --> 49:37.200]  with like solar power you are truly self-sustainable that's a really good
[49:37.200 --> 49:39.960]  point and I like what you mentioned about people concerned about what's
[49:39.960 --> 49:43.560]  going in their food because here at info wars Alex has covered and I've
[49:43.560 --> 49:48.160]  covered also extensively GMOs and we've covered the things that are in your food
[49:48.160 --> 49:53.320]  for example a lot of fish in the ocean are contaminated even even farm race
[49:53.320 --> 49:58.880]  fish are contaminated with heavy metals like mercury sometimes cadmium and
[49:58.880 --> 50:02.880]  other things that you can find in in the fish out there but if you grow your
[50:02.880 --> 50:07.800]  own food literally you know exactly what's in it and what's not in it that's
[50:07.800 --> 50:12.560]  right you can trust it at that point yes you have total control over that well
[50:12.560 --> 50:16.800]  so how easy is it for people to get started I mean I've seen aquaponic
[50:16.800 --> 50:22.480]  gardens growing in reclaimed bathtubs from the junkyard or barrels or just
[50:22.480 --> 50:26.560]  any container that people can find right and I agree I encourage that like for
[50:26.560 --> 50:30.640]  instance April 15th in Austin is the bulk pickup day I'd encourage you if you
[50:30.640 --> 50:34.320]  don't have a container that you can use go down the street and find a container
[50:34.320 --> 50:38.200]  something that's large enough to hold fish and water a tray that's large enough
[50:38.200 --> 50:42.680]  to hold media and bring those to us and we'll drill that out plummet for you give
[50:42.680 --> 50:47.040]  you the fittings and the pumps and fill that with media we can help you get the
[50:47.040 --> 50:49.880]  fish all right stay with us we're gonna go to break but stay with us folks we'll
[50:49.880 --> 50:53.720]  be right back here on the Alex Jones show with more about self-reliance food
[50:53.720 --> 50:56.920]  production systems aquaponics and then more breaking news next hour about
[50:56.920 --> 51:01.640]  North Korea stay with us we'll be right back after this break nothing is more

[54:01.320 --> 54:07.280]  the Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[54:07.280 --> 54:12.400]  because there's a war on for your mind
[54:14.120 --> 54:18.400]  all right welcome back this is the Alex Jones show Mike Adams filling in for
[54:18.400 --> 54:22.200]  Alex and he is in the building and he will be back here in the studio in the
[54:22.200 --> 54:26.280]  next hour to give us more breaking news on what's happening with North Korea and
[54:26.280 --> 54:30.720]  in the meantime we're talking about self-reliance food technologies and I've
[54:30.720 --> 54:34.000]  been doing a lot of research on this you know my nickname is the health ranger
[54:34.000 --> 54:37.960]  and so I'm into health and growing your own food and being self-reliant and
[54:37.960 --> 54:42.200]  preparing in every way possible so I began to do some research on what is the
[54:42.200 --> 54:47.520]  best system for people anywhere anytime to produce food so that they know what's
[54:47.520 --> 54:51.280]  in it and no one else can control them if you have your own food you are
[54:51.280 --> 54:56.360]  self-reliant if you don't have your own food you are a subject that can be
[54:56.360 --> 55:02.720]  controlled very easily by controlling the food supply so I found bihydro.com
[55:02.720 --> 55:09.240]  Troy Smith the owner of Bright Ideas here in Austin Texas Bright Ideas B R I T E
[55:09.240 --> 55:15.780]  bihydro.com who founded this store that is now in the center of the Austin
[55:15.780 --> 55:19.480]  aquaponics explosion word is spreading everywhere that you can grow your own
[55:19.480 --> 55:25.760]  food and fish protein easily inexpensively and safely so Troy joins us in
[55:25.760 --> 55:30.160]  the studio here for a couple more minutes to talk about this so Troy things
[55:30.160 --> 55:34.960]  are going crazy in the world now I know you might not want to pay attention all
[55:34.960 --> 55:39.240]  that but it's happening this is going to cause I think a rush of people into
[55:39.240 --> 55:44.080]  these kinds of technologies that can give them more security are you are you
[55:44.080 --> 55:48.080]  seeing I mean what are your thoughts on what's happening with North Korea by the
[55:48.080 --> 55:52.160]  way well I think it's definitely something that we all need to take
[55:52.160 --> 55:58.080]  seriously we should take precautions and be prepared so those of us that want
[55:58.080 --> 56:02.760]  to take care of our families should get a plan and feeding your family should be
[56:02.760 --> 56:07.840]  on the top of the list absolutely are some people feeding themselves as much
[56:07.840 --> 56:12.160]  as like 50% of their diet off of these aquaponics systems at this point or
[56:12.160 --> 56:16.000]  what are you hearing they certainly could from the veggies the fish it would
[56:16.000 --> 56:20.000]  take actually large tanks in order to provide that much fish yeah but you can
[56:20.000 --> 56:25.960]  get a lot of benefit from getting the the benefit of extra fish eventually
[56:25.960 --> 56:29.040]  you're gonna have more fish than you need and those can be harvested and
[56:29.040 --> 56:33.840]  obviously you can eat that so we are talking about what can happen is
[56:33.840 --> 56:37.600]  independent people producing food everywhere this is also an important
[56:37.600 --> 56:44.840]  issue for urban food production right so right now a lot of urban food is
[56:44.840 --> 56:49.440]  really the the crap food excuse my language but it's the worst food you
[56:49.440 --> 56:54.840]  could buy it's the processed msg loaded aspartame genetically modified garbage
[56:54.840 --> 57:00.360]  so couldn't people in a small amount of space in a city they could be growing
[57:00.360 --> 57:03.640]  even on a rooftop they could be growing a significant part of their diet that's
[57:03.640 --> 57:08.880]  true and with aquaponics you can grow in a very dense situation in soil the
[57:08.880 --> 57:12.320]  plants compete for the nutrients that's in the soil so they have to have more
[57:12.320 --> 57:18.400]  room for their root zones so that they can grow to their potentials in
[57:18.400 --> 57:22.440]  aquaponics you're delivering all the food and water to the roots so you can
[57:22.440 --> 57:26.760]  grow very very densely you'd be very surprised in a small area how much you
[57:26.760 --> 57:29.480]  can really produce they were just showing footage there for those of you
[57:29.480 --> 57:33.760]  watching on prismplant.tv that's footage excuse me that I shot at bright
[57:33.760 --> 57:38.800]  ideas here in Austin showing the aquaponics grow beds and the grow media
[57:38.800 --> 57:42.320]  you'll notice there's no soil in the system those are our expanded shale
[57:42.320 --> 57:47.000]  rocks basically there's no soil the water is recirculated so you're not using
[57:47.000 --> 57:51.440]  up the water also importantly you're not using municipal water on these systems
[57:51.440 --> 57:55.680]  because a lot of people don't realize crops today are grown in fluoridated
[57:55.680 --> 58:02.200]  water right so I mean you're eating like concentrated fluoride in your plants in
[58:02.200 --> 58:07.560]  a lot of conventional crops that's right so good source of water is very
[58:07.560 --> 58:12.480]  important something to think about in conventional farming you use a lot of
[58:12.480 --> 58:15.800]  water the water goes through the water table it evaporates to the environment
[58:15.800 --> 58:21.560]  in aquaponics you recirculate the water you actually use 10% of the amount of
[58:21.560 --> 58:25.040]  water in aquaponics as you do in conventional farming one-tenth the
[58:25.040 --> 58:29.960]  water there you go that's good news for those in LA Arizona dry arid areas
[58:29.960 --> 58:33.200]  anyway this is the Alex Jones show Mike Adams sitting in today we'll be right
[58:33.200 --> 58:36.880]  back with more on food freedom technologies and breaking news on North
[58:36.880 --> 58:46.360]  Korea in the next hour stay with us this is GCN the Genesis communications
[58:46.360 --> 58:55.000]  radio network you prepare by purchasing gold food and firearms but if you don't
[58:55.000 --> 58:58.560]  have a home security system then you're missing a critical weapon in your
[58:58.560 --> 59:02.520]  arsenal for home protection when you're sleeping or away from home who's
[59:02.520 --> 59:06.960]  watching out for intruders check out simply safe it's a new do-it-yourself
[59:06.960 --> 59:12.520]  home security system that is completely wireless go to get simply safe calm
[59:12.520 --> 59:17.760]  simply safe is independent and off the grid it runs on battery power so even
[59:17.760 --> 59:22.280]  if the grid goes down you're protected it's completely customizable so you can
[59:22.280 --> 59:27.640]  use it in your home business boat trailer storage unit or shed get simply
[59:27.640 --> 59:32.680]  safe calm simply safe is also ridiculously easy to install yourself in

[59:51.800 --> 1:00:00.600]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCM radio network
[1:00:04.720 --> 1:00:12.440]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[1:00:12.440 --> 1:00:20.120]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:00:20.120 --> 1:00:27.480]  Alex Jones this is the Alex Jones show welcome back to the second hour Mike
[1:00:27.480 --> 1:00:32.000]  Adams the health ranger filling in here for Alex guest hosting today Alex is in
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:36.080]  the building and will be giving a special reports in the next few minutes in
[1:00:36.080 --> 1:00:41.440]  fact we've got Troy Smith here from Bright Ideas in Austin and that's bi
[1:00:41.440 --> 1:00:46.880]  hydro.com just like it sounds bi hydro.com and he's not a sponsor of the
[1:00:46.880 --> 1:00:52.360]  show yet but we're gonna try to talk him into the reason the reason oh no we
[1:00:52.360 --> 1:01:02.480]  crash your server man your website's down yeah well as this grows you're
[1:01:02.480 --> 1:01:06.280]  gonna need to beef up your server that's for sure it sounds good but for those of
[1:01:06.280 --> 1:01:11.840]  you listening just try it again you know in a few hours so bi hydro.com is
[1:01:11.840 --> 1:01:16.040]  down this this happens all the time I'm telling you the Alex Jones show has a
[1:01:16.040 --> 1:01:19.240]  huge reach you're reaching a lot of people what do you want to say that to
[1:01:19.240 --> 1:01:25.000]  the million people listening right now about aquaponics aquaponics is is
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:31.880]  growing it's it's something that everybody can achieve if people are out
[1:01:31.880 --> 1:01:36.160]  there thinking it's something that's too difficult and too complicated it's very
[1:01:36.160 --> 1:01:42.120]  very simple we can set you up very easily it's very very easy to maintain
[1:01:42.120 --> 1:01:45.920]  it's not gonna take a lot away from your lifestyle and yeah it's pretty much
[1:01:45.920 --> 1:01:49.840]  like once it's going I mean you have to cycle some things at the first but once
[1:01:49.840 --> 1:01:52.840]  it's going it pretty much runs itself that's right now here's another thing
[1:01:52.840 --> 1:01:56.760]  from a nutritional aspect listen in folks this is crucial you know the
[1:01:56.760 --> 1:02:01.880]  importance of trace minerals like selenium and chromium for proper blood
[1:02:01.880 --> 1:02:06.760]  sugar regulation for example or a magnesium a zinc for immune system
[1:02:06.760 --> 1:02:10.520]  function these minerals and and this was actually brought to my attention by
[1:02:10.520 --> 1:02:16.080]  your guy there Jason brilliant guy who works at your store that that if you
[1:02:16.080 --> 1:02:22.480]  actually are putting these minerals into your soil plants then the minerals are
[1:02:22.480 --> 1:02:27.480]  being lost and they're not going into the plants but if you add these minerals
[1:02:27.480 --> 1:02:32.120]  to an aquaponics system because they're being recirculated in the water your
[1:02:32.120 --> 1:02:37.000]  plants are going to uptake 90 plus percent of the selenium which means you
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:40.440]  eat those plants you are in fact nourishing your body with those trace
[1:02:40.440 --> 1:02:44.480]  minerals that are missing in everyday foods right and that's why we encourage
[1:02:44.480 --> 1:02:48.360]  the media beds because that's where you can fortify the beds we like to
[1:02:48.360 --> 1:02:55.840]  encourage for instance green sand minerals plus rock phosphates things of
[1:02:55.840 --> 1:02:59.720]  that nature you can put all that right into the media beds and getting that
[1:02:59.720 --> 1:03:03.200]  fortified is going to give you all those extra minerals that's crucial you know
[1:03:03.200 --> 1:03:08.400]  all my research choice says that eating minerals in their inorganic forms
[1:03:08.400 --> 1:03:13.280]  non-organic forms like non-plant forms is really not that beneficial to the
[1:03:13.280 --> 1:03:20.880]  body you know like magnesium oxide for example not that useful compared to
[1:03:20.880 --> 1:03:24.760]  something like magnesium malate which is more bioavailable but when you put
[1:03:24.760 --> 1:03:27.960]  minerals in the grow beds in an aquaponics system the plants take them up
[1:03:27.960 --> 1:03:33.240]  and they convert them into bioavailable minerals which is what keeps you alive
[1:03:33.240 --> 1:03:37.200]  folks I mean you want to you want to heal well you want to be resistant to a
[1:03:37.200 --> 1:03:41.240]  biological attack or an epidemic outbreak you want to be immune to the
[1:03:41.240 --> 1:03:45.040]  flu you want to not have heart disease not have cancer you need to get these
[1:03:45.040 --> 1:03:48.800]  minerals into your system selenium prevents cancer and boosts brain function
[1:03:48.800 --> 1:03:52.120]  prevents Alzheimer's and dementia this is the technology to get the minerals
[1:03:52.120 --> 1:03:57.520]  into your body it works that's right yeah so there's no reason why you can't
[1:03:57.520 --> 1:04:03.800]  have a truly wholesome food it's it doesn't cost a lot of money to fortify
[1:04:03.800 --> 1:04:08.400]  the beds it's inexpensive amendments so I encourage it well very good I want to
[1:04:08.400 --> 1:04:13.000]  thank you Troy it's great having you here I hope that your store does well

[1:08:20.160 --> 1:08:23.120]  alex jones
[1:08:23.120 --> 1:08:27.320]  continue with the second hour this is the alex jones show mic adams co-hosting
[1:08:27.320 --> 1:08:31.440]  right now with alex who's in the studio here breaking down more information
[1:08:31.440 --> 1:08:35.120]  breaking news on north korea developments there we've been talking
[1:08:35.120 --> 1:08:38.160]  about food independence and self-reliance we've got more guests coming up
[1:08:38.160 --> 1:08:41.560]  including a geoengineering guest in the third hour but let's go to alex now for
[1:08:41.560 --> 1:08:47.520]  more on north korea and the prospect of war absolutely and this is breaking now
[1:08:47.520 --> 1:08:50.240]  they're gonna be a print off of it and bring it in here they're gonna put it on
[1:08:50.240 --> 1:08:56.320]  screen here in just a moment fox news is reporting that a family well they're
[1:08:56.320 --> 1:09:00.200]  saying the children were kidnapped and then they cut to a shot of info wars
[1:09:00.200 --> 1:09:07.120]  calm spray painted on a mailbox okay and and then they just imply that we're
[1:09:07.120 --> 1:09:14.960]  involved in kidnapping of children and then you learn then you learn that it
[1:09:14.960 --> 1:09:20.440]  was the parents with their own kids not wanting cps to have them so in fact you
[1:09:20.440 --> 1:09:23.240]  cover some of the north korean is i'm gonna go i'm gonna go get it pulled up
[1:09:23.240 --> 1:09:26.200]  alright go ahead go ahead and get that pulled up it's insane bottom line folks
[1:09:26.200 --> 1:09:29.300]  is that info wars gets blamed for everything but this gets back to the
[1:09:29.300 --> 1:09:32.840]  same point that alex was mentioning just in the previous hour which is that
[1:09:32.840 --> 1:09:37.600]  the establishment wants to bring down and discredit matt drudge drudge report
[1:09:37.600 --> 1:09:42.120]  info wars and in natural news the website where i'm the editor and so on
[1:09:42.120 --> 1:09:46.800]  and world net daily joseph era over there why do they do that because they
[1:09:46.800 --> 1:09:54.680]  can't control us we have no bosses we are our own bosses we answer to you the
[1:09:54.680 --> 1:09:58.840]  audience we answer to the readers to the listeners that's it we don't have
[1:09:58.840 --> 1:10:04.880]  investors pulling our strings we don't have someone who can control us because
[1:10:04.880 --> 1:10:09.920]  they have dirt on us we are completely independent and passion driven people
[1:10:09.920 --> 1:10:13.640]  who believe in liberty who believe in telling the truth who believe in whistle
[1:10:13.640 --> 1:10:17.760]  blowing and then exposing the lies and fraud of the pharmaceutical industry or
[1:10:17.760 --> 1:10:22.760]  gmo's or politics or false flags you name it that's what we believe in and
[1:10:22.760 --> 1:10:27.360]  we're gonna be here doing it for as long as we can no matter what the case but
[1:10:27.360 --> 1:10:31.720]  getting back to north korea and alex will will be joining us here he's out
[1:10:31.720 --> 1:10:34.920]  there talking to the to the crew right now about what's going on with that
[1:10:34.920 --> 1:10:39.360]  kidnapping north korea situation is of course escalating the u.s. is now
[1:10:39.360 --> 1:10:45.040]  sending a missile defense system to guam to defend against north korea but that
[1:10:45.040 --> 1:10:48.400]  doesn't even make sense because you don't just set these up in 24 hours it
[1:10:48.400 --> 1:10:53.160]  probably won't be set up until you know the year 2015 or something north korea's
[1:10:53.160 --> 1:10:58.400]  army said it has quote ratified an attack against the United States some of
[1:10:58.400 --> 1:11:02.160]  the actions they've taken over the past few weeks present a real and clear
[1:11:02.160 --> 1:11:08.840]  danger says hagel us defense secretary chuck hagel clear and present danger to
[1:11:08.840 --> 1:11:13.760]  to quote tom clancy's book title and movie title there the pentagon says it's
[1:11:13.760 --> 1:11:18.040]  also going to deploy a terminal high altitude area defense missile system the
[1:11:18.040 --> 1:11:24.840]  fad defense system to guam we've got stealth bombers now doing some practice
[1:11:24.840 --> 1:11:28.640]  runs over in that area it looks like we've got some ages cruisers heading
[1:11:28.640 --> 1:11:32.600]  that direction troops are being amassed on the border between north korea and
[1:11:32.600 --> 1:11:37.120]  south korea and they're absolutely insane leader kim jong-un is threatening
[1:11:37.120 --> 1:11:41.360]  everything he says he's gonna nuke austin he's gonna nuke los angeles he's gonna
[1:11:41.360 --> 1:11:46.320]  nuke seattle now it is true that he's got nukes the question is can he actually
[1:11:46.320 --> 1:11:53.080]  launch them on missiles now think about this for a minute if I mean the why
[1:11:53.080 --> 1:11:57.640]  isn't the United States why haven't we already taken out this guy all right now
[1:11:57.640 --> 1:12:03.400]  I'm not a pro war type of guy I'm not an interventionist type of guy I lean more
[1:12:03.400 --> 1:12:07.080]  towards Ron Paul on these issues but when you've got a nation like that that is
[1:12:07.080 --> 1:12:11.160]  directly threatening you holding a gun to your head a nuclear missile to your
[1:12:11.160 --> 1:12:15.240]  head and saying we're gonna launch missiles and actually broadcasting the
[1:12:15.240 --> 1:12:18.800]  targets that where they're gonna hit your cities with nukes I mean come on
[1:12:18.800 --> 1:12:23.200]  what more excuse do you need folks you send the team in there and you take them
[1:12:23.200 --> 1:12:27.800]  out you take out the leadership of north korea whether you do it on the ground
[1:12:27.800 --> 1:12:33.120]  or whether you do it from high orbit you know secret space weaponry that that
[1:12:33.120 --> 1:12:36.720]  the government's got it doesn't matter you take them out because it is an
[1:12:36.720 --> 1:12:41.200]  imminent threat they have threatened to kill essentially tens of millions of
[1:12:41.200 --> 1:12:45.960]  Americans who live in the US cities so why are we doing nothing in North Korea
[1:12:45.960 --> 1:12:49.840]  why are we spending all our military assets in the Middle East remember when
[1:12:49.840 --> 1:12:54.400]  when even those people never even really directly threatened us you know Bush had
[1:12:54.400 --> 1:13:00.400]  to invent the evidence to justify an attack on Saddam Hussein I mean it was
[1:13:00.400 --> 1:13:04.360]  all fabricated you know the yellow cake the weapons of mass destruction it was
[1:13:04.360 --> 1:13:09.480]  all fabricated but yet when there's a real threat from North Korea who really
[1:13:09.480 --> 1:13:12.480]  does have nukes because they've been testing them that's that's confirmed
[1:13:12.480 --> 1:13:18.440]  when there's a real threat the US does nothing what's our military for if it's
[1:13:18.440 --> 1:13:24.400]  not to defend us against these kind of tyrants now Kim Jong-un is a psychopath
[1:13:24.400 --> 1:13:30.360]  he is dangerous precisely because he is unpredictable when you are negotiating
[1:13:30.360 --> 1:13:38.120]  nation to nation when you are trying to position yourself in in defending your
[1:13:38.120 --> 1:13:43.240]  nation against war you have to rely on the assumption that the other party is
[1:13:43.240 --> 1:13:49.160]  rational if you are negotiating both parties have to be rational if one
[1:13:49.160 --> 1:13:55.240]  party is highly irrational which is Kim Jong-un or I don't know how you Kim
[1:13:55.240 --> 1:13:59.560]  Jong-un probably is the best way to say it he's he's actually sort of
[1:13:59.560 --> 1:14:04.560]  fulfilling some of the UN's desires to get things stirred up but if he's not
[1:14:04.560 --> 1:14:08.520]  rational you can't negotiate with him and he might do something crazy that is
[1:14:08.520 --> 1:14:12.200]  even against his own interests you see this is a key psychological element that
[1:14:12.200 --> 1:14:17.040]  you got to understand we rely on national leaders to do things that are in
[1:14:17.040 --> 1:14:21.680]  their own interests if they abandon that line of thinking then they are
[1:14:21.680 --> 1:14:26.280]  unpredictable and they are dangerous and that's where we are with Kim Jong-un
[1:14:26.280 --> 1:14:33.440]  now you have that piece Alex yeah I sure do post it up at info wars.com
[1:14:33.440 --> 1:14:37.880]  here's the headline anti-government parents allegedly kidnap their own
[1:14:37.880 --> 1:14:44.000]  children you kidnap your own children and this is Fox 13 it says that they
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  went to an anti-government rally and so their children were taken because you
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:50.840]  know all the dramas and sitcom show that is terrorist right it's like the
[1:14:50.840 --> 1:14:55.760]  veterans are being grabbed en masse and having their guns taken with no criminal
[1:14:55.760 --> 1:15:02.000]  record no mental record this is the purge the Nazis and the Soviets and we
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  actually put this on screen they were actually yeah and by anti-government
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:08.840]  rallies it's just like a does that mean like a no no no they just say they went
[1:15:08.840 --> 1:15:14.600]  to an anti-government rally and when the police learned that they'd gone to an
[1:15:14.600 --> 1:15:17.840]  anti-government rally when they got back to Florida they took their children
[1:15:17.840 --> 1:15:21.880]  says it right here in the article and they're and they're announcing it like
[1:15:21.880 --> 1:15:26.400]  they have terrorist and so the parents got their children back and then
[1:15:26.400 --> 1:15:30.480]  disappeared with them and I mean how dare them it's like the Soviet Union you
[1:15:30.480 --> 1:15:33.720]  know some people in the Soviet Union ran to the woods right and they were
[1:15:33.720 --> 1:15:37.560]  terrorists they were terrorists as well and then throughout the newscast they
[1:15:37.560 --> 1:15:41.280]  just show that they had info wars dot com bumper sticker that looks like a
[1:15:41.280 --> 1:15:45.120]  spray painted that's a bumper sticker we've put out and they just show the
[1:15:45.120 --> 1:15:50.160]  insane criminal evil that is info wars dot com so they're basically trying to
[1:15:50.160 --> 1:15:55.440]  blame info wars for parents abducting their own children but I mean it's like
[1:15:55.440 --> 1:15:59.400]  this it's like this all the time it's the same but again coming up the next
[1:15:59.400 --> 1:16:02.120]  hour you have the special piece we're gonna premiere here on the radio right
[1:16:02.120 --> 1:16:05.760]  where there is no new world order and there are no bullets and Glenn Beck
[1:16:05.760 --> 1:16:10.480]  agrees and there's no armored assault vehicles the DHS doesn't exist hey have
[1:16:10.480 --> 1:16:13.800]  you started selling imaginary bullets yet for out of your store remember that's
[1:16:13.800 --> 1:16:17.680]  that's the way to raise some revenue right there the government's buying
[1:16:17.680 --> 1:16:22.640]  imaginary bullets in huge quantities meanwhile our government allowed in the
[1:16:22.640 --> 1:16:27.360]  UN allowed ABB the Swiss company with Rumsfeld as its head to actually
[1:16:27.360 --> 1:16:34.640]  transfer the reactors in the mid 90s to there it is the mailbox with info wars
[1:16:34.640 --> 1:16:39.320]  dot com to North Korea so they would have this and now North Korea quote
[1:16:39.320 --> 1:16:43.680]  approves nuclear strike on the United States that is French news agency AFP
[1:16:43.680 --> 1:16:48.640]  Reuters also has the similar headline and that was yesterday now they're
[1:16:48.640 --> 1:16:53.440]  moving all sorts of US military equipment into the area they're openly
[1:16:53.440 --> 1:16:58.040]  talking about all sorts of war I mean it is just getting crazier and crazier and
[1:16:58.040 --> 1:17:02.240]  crazier I got something for you Alex what about this represent a Colorado
[1:17:02.240 --> 1:17:08.080]  Democrat representative Diana to get to getty she doesn't realize she's a gun
[1:17:08.080 --> 1:17:13.240]  control person she doesn't realize that magazines can be reloaded she says that
[1:17:13.240 --> 1:17:17.240]  if you have a 30 round mag which I have here in the studio that once you use
[1:17:17.240 --> 1:17:21.280]  them the bullets will have been shot and then there won't be any more magazines
[1:17:21.280 --> 1:17:26.640]  available there's actually a video well you see see you've got the globalists
[1:17:26.640 --> 1:17:28.960]  that are all buying millions of bulletproof vehicles they know about
[1:17:28.960 --> 1:17:32.160]  weapons allowed to use them yeah fine signs a big gun aficionado owns a bunch
[1:17:32.160 --> 1:17:36.640]  has bodyguards but they count on the general public who think that if they
[1:17:36.640 --> 1:17:41.000]  fire a 22 it's gonna explode they're gonna fly back like like like police
[1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:47.560]  academy right yeah yeah so yeah there's a magazine so yes the the sheep will feel
[1:17:47.560 --> 1:17:50.880]  safe when they see someone in a black uniform with with police dogs barking
[1:17:50.880 --> 1:17:54.720]  at him like Nazi Germany but they don't feel safe if they drive by farmers all
[1:17:54.720 --> 1:17:58.960]  over the country right even in rural areas that have shot guns in their in
[1:17:58.960 --> 1:18:02.800]  their cab yeah police are called anywhere in Texas now if you fire guns
[1:18:02.800 --> 1:18:07.480]  even on 10,000 acre ranches helicopters police you name it come and then they
[1:18:07.480 --> 1:18:10.640]  come because you're not allowed to shoot guns in America there's no wall
[1:18:10.640 --> 1:18:14.840]  veterans are being grabbed by the thousands a week that we know of drug
[1:18:14.840 --> 1:18:18.680]  off forced drug made to sign papers are mentally ill their guns are taken and
[1:18:18.680 --> 1:18:23.880]  then their kids and God forbid a veteran run with his son or daughter because now
[1:18:23.880 --> 1:18:27.920]  you're a terrorist and they have amber alerts oh my gosh it actually says in
[1:18:27.920 --> 1:18:32.520]  the news article this is from Fox 13 I'm reading that the children were taken
[1:18:32.520 --> 1:18:38.160]  after they went to the anti-government extremist rally and then when police
[1:18:38.160 --> 1:18:45.360]  questioned them about it at the at the anti-gun the the at the anti-government
[1:18:45.360 --> 1:18:50.800]  rally that they were arrested because he was talking crazy and again it's crazy
[1:18:50.800 --> 1:18:54.240]  to say there's a takeover he probably he cops new world order it's yeah yeah
[1:18:54.240 --> 1:18:58.320]  DHS is arming new world order foreign banks are imploding us they're
[1:18:58.320 --> 1:19:02.640]  arresting veterans it's totally hellish you know the Obama shipping guns of

[1:24:28.800 --> 1:24:32.680]  then I was gonna come in in the afternoon as he begs to go bass fishing I was
[1:24:32.680 --> 1:24:35.640]  gonna come in to administrative stuff and work on things so about eight or nine
[1:24:35.640 --> 1:24:41.200]  tonight and then go out for a little company dinner and I had to just come in
[1:24:41.200 --> 1:24:44.600]  because of all this happening but listen just happens in a Don Salazar calls me
[1:24:44.600 --> 1:24:47.800]  back in there at the start of the last hour and goes look at this local news
[1:24:47.800 --> 1:24:54.200]  cast off of Fox in Florida in Tampa and it's like their headline is children
[1:24:54.200 --> 1:24:58.120]  kidnapped amber alert there it is Orlando Sentinel amber alerts search
[1:24:58.120 --> 1:25:03.200]  continues for two boys abducted from grandmother's home by anti-government

[1:25:19.120 --> 1:25:25.880]  Joshua Hacken an engineer from Tampa was arrested at the rally okay so so
[1:25:25.880 --> 1:25:29.440]  suspicious about this rally being called anti-government well but what the
[1:25:29.440 --> 1:25:33.120]  point is our government's been seized by the globalist yeah it's an occupied
[1:25:33.120 --> 1:25:36.720]  government but listen here's the issue what was my whole show yesterday

[1:26:05.160 --> 1:26:09.200]  amber alerts hunting the Patriots this is how they're gonna start the civil war
[1:26:09.200 --> 1:26:13.760]  is coming after people's kids they're gonna start it yeah they're losing the
[1:26:13.760 --> 1:26:18.440]  info war no one watches CNN MSNBC everybody knows their terrorists the
[1:26:18.440 --> 1:26:22.400]  stage 9-11 stage Oklahoma City we everybody knows it's a foreign banking
[1:26:22.400 --> 1:26:26.920]  cartel that runs al-Qaeda everybody knows now and so they're gonna call us
[1:26:26.920 --> 1:26:31.000]  terrorist and try to start a civil war hoping the smoke screen distracts
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:33.880]  everybody Mike we were talking during the break I mean you see me running around
[1:26:33.880 --> 1:26:36.920]  like a chicken with my head cut off because we say this is real yeah I know
[1:26:36.920 --> 1:26:39.560]  I know they're gonna pull out all the stops but you're right the point is they
[1:26:39.560 --> 1:26:43.880]  are trying to provoke this because they want somebody to fight back so that they
[1:26:43.880 --> 1:26:47.960]  have an excuse to lay down something like martial law and if they don't get it
[1:26:47.960 --> 1:26:50.660]  through these provocations they're probably gonna get an excuse with North
[1:26:50.660 --> 1:26:54.640]  Korea as we've been talking but it's gonna be just like Mexico you have a
[1:26:54.640 --> 1:26:59.200]  couple cops couple prosecutors getting killed in in in Colorado and Texas yeah
[1:26:59.200 --> 1:27:03.160]  and they're basically on lock now with details scared to death okay I don't want
[1:27:03.160 --> 1:27:08.440]  to war with the police and military it's wrong to be arresting and without
[1:27:08.440 --> 1:27:11.160]  charges and taking guns of veterans right with no criminal record no
[1:27:11.160 --> 1:27:15.400]  psychiatric background it's illegal okay it's illegal to be taking people's
[1:27:15.400 --> 1:27:19.520]  kids that haven't taken shots when there's no law it's all illegal okay and
[1:27:19.520 --> 1:27:24.360]  so here's the deal you're pushing us okay you're pushing it and the globalists
[1:27:24.360 --> 1:27:28.680]  are gonna sit off shore while this country goes up in flame okay so police
[1:27:28.680 --> 1:27:32.080]  and military better have a conversation right now because we say when
[1:27:32.080 --> 1:27:35.040]  you're out of the military they're gonna take your guns too you know and
[1:27:35.040 --> 1:27:39.520]  historically by the way I just got to say this liberty has never been achieved
[1:27:39.520 --> 1:27:43.800]  passively by sitting back and doing nothing even Gandhi he had a bunch of
[1:27:43.800 --> 1:27:46.640]  rebels in the country that were fighting against the occupation there
[1:27:46.640 --> 1:27:51.580]  liberty has not been achieved passively Alex that's something I'm not calling for
[1:27:51.580 --> 1:27:56.560]  violence and in any way whatsoever but you can't sit back and find freedom it's
[1:27:56.560 --> 1:28:00.120]  just it's a rule of the universe well you know Glenn Beck calls me a fascist and
[1:28:00.120 --> 1:28:03.400]  calls me spooky because he's a gatekeeper and I wish you'd come in on the
[1:28:03.400 --> 1:28:06.000]  team but everybody's having pressure put on them they've tried to buy you out
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:09.520]  recently that globalists have tried to offer me all sorts of deals you know
[1:28:09.520 --> 1:28:14.320]  you know this is the issue here is is that they're taking over and everybody's
[1:28:14.320 --> 1:28:17.920]  scared and everybody's gonna go along with this I'm not the one that's spooky
[1:28:17.920 --> 1:28:22.640]  the New World Order in get I mean ladies and gentlemen I'm reading where
[1:28:22.640 --> 1:28:24.640]  they're not gonna start taking money out of bank accounts in other European
[1:28:24.640 --> 1:28:28.960]  countries first it was 10 then 20 then 40 then 50 then 60 then 80 now they're
[1:28:28.960 --> 1:28:32.240]  gonna take everything and they're gonna do that here I found where Geithner's
[1:28:32.240 --> 1:28:35.160]  saying they're gonna take private pension funds and you know what when you
[1:28:35.160 --> 1:28:38.560]  don't when you get angry about it the cops aren't gonna shoot rubber bullets
[1:28:38.560 --> 1:28:41.640]  at you folks they're gonna mow you down they're gonna have cops mowing people
[1:28:41.640 --> 1:28:44.960]  down when the cops have had their pensions taken look at Spain where
[1:28:44.960 --> 1:28:48.480]  they've been killing people over their pensions being stolen well and the cops
[1:28:48.480 --> 1:28:53.360]  have had theirs taken to you idiots they're defending the very system that's
[1:28:53.360 --> 1:28:57.240]  going to betray them that's what they don't realize yet the pensions are gonna
[1:28:57.240 --> 1:29:00.600]  be targeted no question about it well let's in this family we need to put out
[1:29:00.600 --> 1:29:04.680]  a hotline for the family to call us here yeah so is that the absolutely we
[1:29:04.680 --> 1:29:08.720]  went look he's bought stuff from us it's a listener an engineer we need to come
[1:29:08.720 --> 1:29:12.600]  to his defense and imagine he goes to a anti-government tea party rally yeah a
[1:29:12.600 --> 1:29:16.080]  tea party and then they say you shouldn't have kids at an extremist rally and
[1:29:16.080 --> 1:29:21.920]  then they search his car and claim they found a marijuana paraphernalia which
[1:29:21.920 --> 1:29:25.200]  could be anything well they can plant it on you a pipe yeah yeah I mean I
[1:29:25.200 --> 1:29:28.280]  probably smoke marijuana every three years they're gonna plant it on me and
[1:29:28.280 --> 1:29:32.280]  take my kids well they they they are saying that these parents abducted their
[1:29:32.280 --> 1:29:36.360]  own kids by the way the new thing is they're taking the after the veterans
[1:29:36.360 --> 1:29:39.960]  have the guns taken there's no judge no jury they just say you're mentally ill
[1:29:39.960 --> 1:29:43.640]  your kids are next and I know yeah you're gonna be hunted down too they're
[1:29:43.640 --> 1:29:47.840]  gonna come after all of us this is the reeducation camp takeover Mike Adams

[1:33:25.720 --> 1:33:31.040]  Ranger guest hosting today it's been an interesting show already and I think
[1:33:31.040 --> 1:33:34.200]  Alex I mean he could jump in at any time depending on what's happening by the
[1:33:34.200 --> 1:33:37.280]  way in the third hour we're going to take some phone calls we're going to ask
[1:33:37.280 --> 1:33:43.640]  for calls in the third hour from people in Korea Japan or Taiwan who are
[1:33:43.640 --> 1:33:47.400]  listening to the show and might have information about what's happening in
[1:33:47.400 --> 1:33:54.360]  Korea but especially Korea but please we need you to call in in English that goes
[1:33:54.360 --> 1:33:59.400]  without saying because our audience is English so if you can do that then please
[1:33:59.400 --> 1:34:05.760]  please plan to call us in the third hour now we're going to shift gears here from
[1:34:05.760 --> 1:34:09.880]  the North Korea situation for a while and we're going to go back into food
[1:34:09.880 --> 1:34:14.320]  self-reliance because this is a key technology now I believe there are five
[1:34:14.320 --> 1:34:20.600]  key technologies for Liberty that are all decentralized non-controlled
[1:34:20.600 --> 1:34:24.560]  technologies that actually they help you be healthier they help you be more
[1:34:24.560 --> 1:34:30.040]  free and more self-reliant and one of those technologies and probably the key
[1:34:30.040 --> 1:34:34.280]  is aquaponics and I've become a huge fan of aquaponics I'm building my own
[1:34:34.280 --> 1:34:38.920]  system but where I've learned much of that is from this man who's in the
[1:34:38.920 --> 1:34:43.520]  studio with us right now his name is Rob Nash he is the founder of Austin
[1:34:43.520 --> 1:34:48.000]  aquaponics.com he's also a representative for the American is it
[1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:52.360]  the American aquaponics the National the National Association so welcome to the
[1:34:52.360 --> 1:34:55.680]  show Rob excellent thanks for having us it's great to have you here and by the
[1:34:55.680 --> 1:35:00.640]  way you're a really awesome teacher well thanks your course I took your Saturday
[1:35:00.640 --> 1:35:05.400]  course I learned a lot awesome glad to have you you're very good at it so tell
[1:35:05.400 --> 1:35:08.760]  us what tell the audience what you do because you're a hands-on guy who's
[1:35:08.760 --> 1:35:12.480]  having a lot of commercial success with growing food yeah well you know about
[1:35:12.480 --> 1:35:16.440]  seven years ago we decided I'm gonna give this farming thing a try and in
[1:35:16.440 --> 1:35:20.240]  researching the best sustainable methods out there we discovered aquaponics
[1:35:20.240 --> 1:35:25.320]  which seemed to be a perfect fit for us I had already been keeping Koi pond in
[1:35:25.320 --> 1:35:29.840]  the backyard and had experimented with aqua with hydroponics and so they were a
[1:35:29.840 --> 1:35:33.840]  natural combination and so we've been at it commercially for about five years
[1:35:33.840 --> 1:35:38.120]  now and just through demand and multiple requests we started doing the
[1:35:38.120 --> 1:35:43.280]  backyard trainings people had found a new interest in it yeah and it's it's
[1:35:43.280 --> 1:35:46.840]  just blossom from there I can't keep up with the phone calls now you have huge
[1:35:46.840 --> 1:35:51.560]  hoop houses you I was there you have a raft system you've got grow beds you've
[1:35:51.560 --> 1:35:54.880]  got wicking beds you're growing the most beautiful lettuce I've ever seen and
[1:35:54.880 --> 1:35:59.080]  you're actually selling this in groceries all over town right right now
[1:35:59.080 --> 1:36:03.440]  we're really a limited to our one farmers market there oh be cave area okay
[1:36:03.440 --> 1:36:05.880]  one-star farmers market because everybody's buying it up right there
[1:36:05.880 --> 1:36:10.640]  correct and they the greens as you saw that day everybody's in this greens
[1:36:10.640 --> 1:36:14.240]  movement right now it's all about kale and shard and of course the lettuces
[1:36:14.240 --> 1:36:18.760]  always do really well too yeah we're in a few two to be exact local restaurants
[1:36:18.760 --> 1:36:22.320]  Italian restaurants that just can't get enough of our basil and so that's our
[1:36:22.320 --> 1:36:27.440]  biggest commercial market so are you now seeing I mean you've been doing this
[1:36:27.440 --> 1:36:32.880]  for many years but are you seeing a surge in interest from people in in this
[1:36:32.880 --> 1:36:37.480]  food technology absolutely you know aquaponics has officially been on the
[1:36:37.480 --> 1:36:41.120]  map for I'd say six or seven years in terms of small scale or backyard
[1:36:41.120 --> 1:36:47.400]  personal food production but in the last 12 16 months it has just exploded in
[1:36:47.400 --> 1:36:53.080]  terms of backyard hobby gardeners wanting to adopt this as a means to grow
[1:36:53.080 --> 1:36:57.160]  food why do you think that is what are you hearing I would say mostly because of
[1:36:57.160 --> 1:37:00.840]  our in Texas it's mostly because of the climate you know you hear all the time
[1:37:00.840 --> 1:37:04.720]  if gardening were any more difficult it would be impossible
[1:37:04.720 --> 1:37:09.440]  aquaponics has proven to overcome some of the summer challenges as well as in
[1:37:09.440 --> 1:37:14.240]  the wintertime but I would think that with the food safety and security issues
[1:37:14.240 --> 1:37:17.760]  that we have and you know this quote-unquote broken food system that
[1:37:17.760 --> 1:37:20.560]  we're having to deal with I would think more and more people are looking
[1:37:20.560 --> 1:37:27.160]  towards food production really to save on their food but Bill yeah but more or
[1:37:27.160 --> 1:37:31.160]  less to salvage their gardening hobby which again has become frustrating to
[1:37:31.160 --> 1:37:34.640]  many people in central Texas but I also noticed that aquaponics really seems
[1:37:34.640 --> 1:37:40.720]  to appeal to men a lot where like soil gardening seems to be women do more of
[1:37:40.720 --> 1:37:44.600]  that for whatever reason but I think aquaponics there's more gadgetry involved
[1:37:44.600 --> 1:37:47.720]  and it's kind of cool to build it you know guys like that I think you're right
[1:37:47.720 --> 1:37:51.560]  on the money there I think aquaponics really gets most men's tinkering bone
[1:37:51.560 --> 1:37:54.960]  if you will yeah right and then of course the wife is always supportive
[1:37:54.960 --> 1:37:58.080]  because hey it gives him something to do keeps him in the house or in the back
[1:37:58.080 --> 1:38:02.880]  yeah it keeps it out of trouble right and really once you've once you've
[1:38:02.880 --> 1:38:07.040]  overcome the initial cost it's really a low-cost hobby if you will so what a
[1:38:07.040 --> 1:38:10.720]  better way for a family to spend some time than for the man to be able to
[1:38:10.720 --> 1:38:13.640]  build something watch it go and then the ladies to be able to bring something to
[1:38:13.640 --> 1:38:17.000]  the food table yeah and it's incredible because you don't even have to really
[1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:20.760]  bend over that much you know a lot of people don't like just the physical
[1:38:20.760 --> 1:38:25.960]  bending of gardening these grow beds and aquaponics are at waist height you can
[1:38:25.960 --> 1:38:29.640]  set them almost at any height you want correct and I've even heard of people in
[1:38:29.640 --> 1:38:33.720]  wheelchairs running aquaponics systems because they can do it they they can
[1:38:33.720 --> 1:38:38.340]  physically do it that is correct yeah you get a lot of elderly folks or in one
[1:38:38.340 --> 1:38:42.760]  way or another disabled and they really do enjoy the raised beds and in a
[1:38:42.760 --> 1:38:47.120]  wheelchair access scenario usually there's room underneath the beds that
[1:38:47.120 --> 1:38:50.800]  you could wheel up to so it really is more like a tabletop garden if you will
[1:38:50.800 --> 1:38:54.280]  yeah that's a good way to put it it does take out a lot of the bending over in
[1:38:54.280 --> 1:38:58.880]  the back aches there's no weeding no weeding at all yeah I remember you showed
[1:38:58.880 --> 1:39:03.320]  me the weeding it was like one second I think you saw the one way right so you
[1:39:03.320 --> 1:39:09.120]  know it's not zero weeding but one weed versus one day of weed it's pretty cool
[1:39:09.120 --> 1:39:13.760]  now the other thing that I really appreciate about you in particular but
[1:39:13.760 --> 1:39:18.320]  also Troy who we had as a guest earlier but the entire aquaponic community is it
[1:39:18.320 --> 1:39:23.400]  feels very open source to me I don't find a lot of people saying oh I'm not
[1:39:23.400 --> 1:39:28.520]  gonna share my secrets with you you have to pay me $20,000 to have my secret
[1:39:28.520 --> 1:39:33.720]  path into system X you know no aquaponics is like we want to share the
[1:39:33.720 --> 1:39:36.440]  information and empower you with the knowledge that you need to grow your
[1:39:36.440 --> 1:39:40.000]  own food and we hope you can empower others yeah you do see a lot of that I
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:44.800]  believe that aquaponics was really born during this information age if you
[1:39:44.800 --> 1:39:50.000]  will and so it's probably one of the first new substantial things that come
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:55.120]  along that again that was in this information age where everything that
[1:39:55.120 --> 1:39:59.520]  comes along is put out on the internet so we're all learning collectively as
[1:39:59.520 --> 1:40:06.160]  this as this methodology emerges yeah I read that at some point somebody decided
[1:40:06.160 --> 1:40:11.440]  well we should throw worms into the grow beds you know red wigglers and then
[1:40:11.440 --> 1:40:15.760]  suddenly the fish poo problem the build-up problem was solved correct like
[1:40:15.760 --> 1:40:20.640]  who came up with that well really I can't tell you exactly which one person
[1:40:20.640 --> 1:40:24.000]  but collectively there was some back and forth on the subject and they you know
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:27.960]  the idea was a great idea but the organic movement and I'm sure you probably
[1:40:27.960 --> 1:40:31.440]  keep up with this yes there's so many regulations about raw manures and what
[1:40:31.440 --> 1:40:35.560]  not we were really unsure what they were gonna allow us to do in organic food
[1:40:35.560 --> 1:40:40.200]  production yeah so worms had really remained kind of a novel idea and then
[1:40:40.200 --> 1:40:43.440]  once the industry as a whole just said look we're gonna call this now all
[1:40:43.440 --> 1:40:47.840]  natural we're gonna skip this oh sir if you will yeah and forget about sharing
[1:40:47.840 --> 1:40:51.760]  our profits with the government or the USDA and so they just went ahead and
[1:40:51.760 --> 1:40:54.960]  started doing the worms in and then almost immediately we got reports of
[1:40:54.960 --> 1:40:59.480]  such good react results and then like you said we wind up not even having to
[1:40:59.480 --> 1:41:02.440]  clean the gravel anymore that's what's amazing to me about this system and for
[1:41:02.440 --> 1:41:05.480]  those of you listening this is the Alex Jones show this is Mike Adams filling
[1:41:05.480 --> 1:41:10.240]  in for Alex today and yes we're gonna continue to cover North Korea and other
[1:41:10.240 --> 1:41:13.840]  things in the next hour but right now we've got Rob Nash here from Austin
[1:41:13.840 --> 1:41:18.520]  aquaponics.com who is an expert a hands-on expert on aquaponics systems and
[1:41:18.520 --> 1:41:24.120]  I believe this technology is absolutely crucial for liberty for health and with
[1:41:24.120 --> 1:41:27.240]  Troy we talked about the importance how you can put minerals into the system
[1:41:27.240 --> 1:41:30.800]  that are actually taken up by the plants instead of being flushed downstream and
[1:41:30.800 --> 1:41:34.440]  wasted yeah that's another huge advantage isn't it it's incredible you
[1:41:34.440 --> 1:41:37.800]  know you can use pretty much all of your organic supplements that you may have
[1:41:37.800 --> 1:41:41.240]  become accustomed to in organic gardening and it really like you said
[1:41:41.240 --> 1:41:44.800]  stays in the system and it's pretty much a hundred percent absorbed by the
[1:41:44.800 --> 1:41:48.640]  plants there's really nowhere for it to go you know we do have a closed loop
[1:41:48.640 --> 1:41:52.960]  system the only water we add is due to evaporation or plant uptake and so you're
[1:41:52.960 --> 1:41:56.200]  pretty much assured that everything you put in there is going to stay with your
[1:41:56.200 --> 1:42:00.580]  plants yeah I've heard that estimates are uses anywhere from one-tenth to
[1:42:00.580 --> 1:42:05.560]  maybe sometimes one-twentieth of conventional agriculture water correct
[1:42:05.560 --> 1:42:08.800]  yeah you hear anywhere the figures from anywhere to two two percent to ten
[1:42:08.800 --> 1:42:12.880]  percent and I'm gonna say that that depends on what traditional agriculture
[1:42:12.880 --> 1:42:16.320]  you're comparing it to whether it's a rice field or old-school drip harp
[1:42:16.320 --> 1:42:21.480]  drip irrigation and that makes a lot of sense and I also think in terms of the
[1:42:21.480 --> 1:42:25.480]  cost issues there's some upfront cost to it but when you go to the grocery store
[1:42:25.480 --> 1:42:30.720]  now folks you are paying four dollars for an organic red pepper sometimes five
[1:42:30.720 --> 1:42:35.360]  dollars for one red pepper you can grow a thousand dollars worth of red peppers
[1:42:35.360 --> 1:42:40.000]  for almost nothing once you get the system set up I mean you can grow back
[1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:43.880]  huge dollars literally you should be able to see a return on your investment
[1:42:43.880 --> 1:42:47.760]  regardless of what system you went for whether you bought a turnkey system
[1:42:47.760 --> 1:42:51.760]  online or built one yourself you should see a return on that investment within
[1:42:51.760 --> 1:42:55.400]  the first year like you say with prices going up I've seen bell peppers as high
[1:42:55.400 --> 1:42:59.400]  seven dollars a piece that's crazy but also there's another element here I
[1:42:59.400 --> 1:43:02.200]  don't know if you've talked about this with your students but there is the
[1:43:02.200 --> 1:43:09.080]  living energy of foods the bioenergy of foods and when something is dead you
[1:43:09.080 --> 1:43:12.720]  know it's been pulled from the ground and it's been shipped and it's been put
[1:43:12.720 --> 1:43:16.240]  in the grocery store and it looks dead looks like it got run over by a parade
[1:43:16.240 --> 1:43:22.400]  or something that does not have the same life energy as fresh living food that
[1:43:22.400 --> 1:43:26.120]  you pull right out you know piece of lettuce make a salad of living lettuce
[1:43:26.120 --> 1:43:30.200]  yeah well you know the old saying fresh is best but there's really nothing
[1:43:30.200 --> 1:43:32.920]  better than going out and picking food from your garden and taking it straight
[1:43:32.920 --> 1:43:36.880]  to the kitchen and having it that evening and even fish that you can you can
[1:43:36.880 --> 1:43:40.360]  harvest fish and have a fish that evening that's correct suffice it to say
[1:43:40.360 --> 1:43:43.000]  anytime that the wife says well it's your night to cook what are you gonna
[1:43:43.000 --> 1:43:46.800]  have I come back with a couple of fish and some fresh greens and that's for
[1:43:46.800 --> 1:43:50.800]  sure what we're having that evening yeah it's good idea so you are also I
[1:43:50.800 --> 1:43:56.080]  understand that you you sell pre-made systems to people who kind of want to
[1:43:56.080 --> 1:43:58.840]  take the shortcut but I get the feeling that you would prefer people build their
[1:43:58.840 --> 1:44:03.840]  own you know I say the same thing with growing food I've always said I get a
[1:44:03.840 --> 1:44:06.600]  lot more satisfaction out of showing someone how to grow their own super
[1:44:06.600 --> 1:44:10.120]  nutritious food than to sell them these you know $3 heads of lettuce each week
[1:44:10.120 --> 1:44:15.160]  right it's a great way to pay the bills for me but I think most people would get
[1:44:15.160 --> 1:44:19.480]  that same satisfaction out of growing their own so yes we do offer turnkey
[1:44:19.480 --> 1:44:23.640]  systems but I really encourage people to learn how to do this for themselves that
[1:44:23.640 --> 1:44:27.600]  way they're not limited to whatever one size system they bought they would have
[1:44:27.600 --> 1:44:30.600]  an understanding of what it takes to put one of these things together and then
[1:44:30.600 --> 1:44:33.240]  the sky's the limit you know they can take it all the way up to a commercial
[1:44:33.240 --> 1:44:36.680]  scale if they wanted to that's what I hear from everybody who starts this they
[1:44:36.680 --> 1:44:41.240]  get the bug and they want more grow beds more and more and more because it's so
[1:44:41.240 --> 1:44:44.640]  fascinating so rewarding and you know you're gonna save really a small
[1:44:44.640 --> 1:44:47.400]  fortune because one of the one of the news items that we've covered here on
[1:44:47.400 --> 1:44:52.480]  Info Wars in the past is the droughts the weather radicalization that's happened
[1:44:52.480 --> 1:44:57.520]  across the planet you know the the Midwest droughts of last year have
[1:44:57.520 --> 1:45:01.280]  almost collapsed some of the grain supply in the Midwest which is going to
[1:45:01.280 --> 1:45:05.240]  cause food prices to spike and skyrocket actually starting right now right
[1:45:05.240 --> 1:45:09.120]  you're already seeing it in the stores so food is not going to get cheaper but
[1:45:09.120 --> 1:45:14.960]  aquaponics in contrast to grocery foods always gets cheaper in comparison I
[1:45:14.960 --> 1:45:20.040]  would have to agree sure the economics just makes sense right yeah again don't
[1:45:20.040 --> 1:45:23.240]  let the sticker price of a new system shock you although I must say there are
[1:45:23.240 --> 1:45:26.880]  some out there that are a little overpriced in my opinion but I'm gonna
[1:45:26.880 --> 1:45:30.880]  have scenes I'm gonna assume that that's production cost shipping and materials
[1:45:30.880 --> 1:45:34.600]  that they used and the systems that we like to to advise people to build a
[1:45:34.600 --> 1:45:39.200]  really or do-it-yourself or bought from local hydroponic shops such as Troy shop
[1:45:39.200 --> 1:45:44.360]  and with this new aquaponics movement a lot of the hydroponic shops have
[1:45:44.360 --> 1:45:48.760]  embraced aquaponics and so it's a great place to start if you don't know you know
[1:45:48.760 --> 1:45:54.360]  where to start yeah let's talk about food freedom a little bit because another
[1:45:54.360 --> 1:45:58.960]  story that we've covered here is in places like Michigan a woman named Julie
[1:45:58.960 --> 1:46:03.240]  Bass was threatened with 90 days of jail time for having a garden in her own
[1:46:03.240 --> 1:46:08.680]  front yard wow and because of the activism of infowars and my website
[1:46:08.680 --> 1:46:13.080]  natural news and others we were able to get the city of I think Oak Park
[1:46:13.080 --> 1:46:18.080]  Michigan to back off of that was it a year ago or roughly a year ago but there
[1:46:18.080 --> 1:46:22.480]  are other cases where home gardeners are being oppressed and threatened for
[1:46:22.480 --> 1:46:27.600]  growing food in their front yard because the neighbors want this sterilized
[1:46:27.600 --> 1:46:33.760]  weed-free artificial turf look they don't know that they need to be growing
[1:46:33.760 --> 1:46:36.800]  food yeah they don't realize that yet what what are your thoughts on food
[1:46:36.800 --> 1:46:40.520]  freedom well you know I think everybody should grow as much food as they can
[1:46:40.520 --> 1:46:43.980]  squeeze in a yard front or back absolutely I'm assuming that that had
[1:46:43.980 --> 1:46:48.040]  something to do with HOA rules and it was a city rule aesthetics it wasn't
[1:46:48.040 --> 1:46:52.400]  even an HOA it was a city ordinance and I'm guessing this had nothing to do with
[1:46:52.400 --> 1:46:57.160]  aquaponics it now that was just growing cucumbers and soil well as she was
[1:46:57.160 --> 1:47:02.360]  teaching her son to garden you know how dare you teach your children well if I
[1:47:02.360 --> 1:47:05.560]  were on any other show I'd say well don't get me started about politics and
[1:47:05.560 --> 1:47:09.040]  and city regulations and whatnot but I think you know where I'm going with that
[1:47:09.040 --> 1:47:13.520]  it unfortunately there is a lot of that and I think that's why more and more
[1:47:13.520 --> 1:47:16.360]  people don't grow their own food is because there are challenges it's
[1:47:16.360 --> 1:47:22.040]  either aesthetics or it's you know water use issues or the rest of us that are
[1:47:22.040 --> 1:47:25.520]  chasing our tail trying to make a living just don't have the time to devote to a
[1:47:25.520 --> 1:47:29.280]  garden to keep it going yeah that's very that's you know commonly the case
[1:47:29.280 --> 1:47:33.480]  but when I drive down a neighborhood let's say in Austin I'm looking at a
[1:47:33.480 --> 1:47:38.080]  neighborhood like the one right next to your place I go from your place which is
[1:47:38.080 --> 1:47:42.080]  growing food it's very organic it's health and nourishment and then right
[1:47:42.080 --> 1:47:46.360]  across the street there is this artificial neighborhood with an HOA all
[1:47:46.360 --> 1:47:50.440]  these clean lawns everybody they're dying from cancer and heart disease and
[1:47:50.440 --> 1:47:55.720]  diabetes and spending millions of dollars on pharmaceuticals and mammograms
[1:47:55.720 --> 1:47:59.680]  and what they need to do is cross the freaking street and go to you and eat
[1:47:59.680 --> 1:48:05.200]  their way to health and they don't even realize it well and yeah unfortunately
[1:48:05.200 --> 1:48:08.600]  you're correct and I do agree in fact I have a gentleman from that very
[1:48:08.600 --> 1:48:13.000]  neighborhood who because of his HOA is actually willing to share my property
[1:48:13.000 --> 1:48:18.520]  be it investment or not to keep that opportunity but just because he's so
[1:48:18.520 --> 1:48:21.520]  limited in what he can do he's going to come over to my place and share on my
[1:48:21.520 --> 1:48:26.120]  property to continue his gardening oh good you're helping your neighbors it
[1:48:26.120 --> 1:48:31.320]  Rob Nash here from Austin aquaponics folks now the Info Wars audience did
[1:48:31.320 --> 1:48:35.760]  crash Troy's website in the last segment they may crash yours too it's just
[1:48:35.760 --> 1:48:40.240]  warning you in advance incredible Austin aquaponics.com and there's a lot of
[1:48:40.240 --> 1:48:45.280]  great information there another website that I like is the aquaponics source
[1:48:45.280 --> 1:48:49.120]  that's Sylvia's website right right well and I prefer to direct people to the
[1:48:49.120 --> 1:48:53.040]  aquaponics community garden or gardening community okay go ahead give that
[1:48:53.040 --> 1:48:58.160]  website out yeah the forum and again it is it is Sylvia Bernstein's website but
[1:48:58.160 --> 1:49:02.840]  it is called the aquaponics gardening community.com and you'll find that is a
[1:49:02.840 --> 1:49:08.520]  forum and I think as of right now there's just over 9,000 members on there
[1:49:08.520 --> 1:49:13.280]  and majority of them are back yarders or beginners but I will say that it's
[1:49:13.280 --> 1:49:17.840]  probably the biggest collection of aquaponics experts that you'll find
[1:49:17.840 --> 1:49:21.320]  directly communicating with beginners and so there's a ton of good information
[1:49:21.320 --> 1:49:25.760]  on there that's great and I think also the the key concept to get across to
[1:49:25.760 --> 1:49:30.800]  people is you're not using chemicals to grow plants you are growing an ecosystem
[1:49:30.800 --> 1:49:34.960]  there are more bacteria in there than anything you've got bacteria worms fish
[1:49:34.960 --> 1:49:39.920]  and plants all together in a basically a closed-loop system you've got fish food
[1:49:39.920 --> 1:49:44.420]  of course but basically a closed-loop system that is self-sustaining self-
[1:49:44.420 --> 1:49:49.760]  cleaning self-supporting that's that's a breakthrough it's pretty incredible you
[1:49:49.760 --> 1:49:53.400]  know and it's funny because really all we're doing is nurturing nature's
[1:49:53.400 --> 1:49:57.220]  biological process right right really created anything new the earth does this
[1:49:57.220 --> 1:50:01.720]  every day we just created a man-made way of harboring all of those benefits and
[1:50:01.720 --> 1:50:05.440]  and I think the more we understand about the biology of soil and the
[1:50:05.440 --> 1:50:09.200]  importance of funguses and bacteria the more we're able to utilize them to
[1:50:09.200 --> 1:50:13.880]  their to our benefit but it also shows you the contrast to conventional farming
[1:50:13.880 --> 1:50:17.120]  which is really artificial food if you take conventional farming they're
[1:50:17.120 --> 1:50:20.080]  throwing these seeds in the soil and then they're only putting three nutrients
[1:50:20.080 --> 1:50:23.680]  on it in pk and that's it and it's artificial food without the minerals
[1:50:23.680 --> 1:50:26.400]  that they're supposed to be present and without the probiotics without the
[1:50:26.400 --> 1:50:30.920]  healthy soils everything yeah and as we you know in organic farming that the
[1:50:30.920 --> 1:50:34.480]  current saying is you're feeding the soil not the plant and what they're
[1:50:34.480 --> 1:50:37.240]  talking about is the biological activity that's going on in there and
[1:50:37.240 --> 1:50:41.560]  without all those funguses bacterias and the sugars and what not to keep them
[1:50:41.560 --> 1:50:45.480]  thriving really the plants never gonna do anything like you say you can force
[1:50:45.480 --> 1:50:49.120]  feed at the MPs and Ks we're gonna go to a break here Rob but we'll be right back
[1:50:49.120 --> 1:50:52.440]  this is the Alex Jones show we're talking Rob Nash here at Austin aquaponics
[1:50:52.440 --> 1:50:57.120]  this is Mike Adams stay with us we'll be right back with more information
[1:51:00.320 --> 1:51:04.520]  do you suffer from low functioning adrenal or thyroid gland did you know
[1:51:04.520 --> 1:51:08.120]  that mercury from your dental fillings comes off your teeth both as a vapor and
[1:51:08.120 --> 1:51:11.520]  as metal particles into your body wherever mercury deposits in your body
[1:51:11.520 --> 1:51:15.200]  it stops cells from functioning normally animal studies show that mercury
[1:51:15.200 --> 1:51:19.920]  causes kidney function to drop by 60% mercury deposited into your adrenals or
[1:51:19.920 --> 1:51:23.280]  thyroid will cause a corresponding drop in function the number one method by
[1:51:23.280 --> 1:51:26.960]  which your body detoxifies itself of mercury is glutathione the number one
[1:51:26.960 --> 1:51:31.320]  superfood that helps turn on all 75 trillion cells of your body to produce
[1:51:31.320 --> 1:51:35.840]  glutathione is non-denatured whey protein from grass-fed cows after
[1:51:35.840 --> 1:51:40.040]  investigating most high-end whey proteins on the market only one is the

[1:52:13.880 --> 1:52:19.800]  fool the bad guys with a new improved fake TV you asked for it we listened and
[1:52:19.800 --> 1:52:24.320]  we made our new fake TV three times brighter than our previous model the
[1:52:24.320 --> 1:52:28.960]  brightness of our new fake TV is equivalent to a 40 inch TV it simulates
[1:52:28.960 --> 1:52:34.400]  the color and motion of a real TV while you're away from home and when burglars
[1:52:34.400 --> 1:52:37.840]  think someone is home watching television they're likely to pass your
[1:52:37.840 --> 1:52:43.040]  house and move on to an easier target the new brighter fake TV is only 3995

[1:53:04.640 --> 1:53:08.360]  dark because you couldn't afford to pay your electric bill that's closer than
[1:53:08.360 --> 1:53:12.120]  you think you probably haven't heard about this yet because the liberal media
[1:53:12.120 --> 1:53:15.400]  has been suppressing what has fast become in the most shocking news story of
[1:53:15.400 --> 1:53:21.240]  2012 Obama's secret war on coal that could increase your already high power
[1:53:21.240 --> 1:53:26.680]  bill as much as 400% in coming months as shocking as it sounds it may well be
[1:53:26.680 --> 1:53:31.040]  just a matter of time before the lights start going out across America but here
[1:53:31.040 --> 1:53:36.160]  is some good news there's an underground video at Exposed123.com that
[1:53:36.160 --> 1:53:39.680]  thousands of smart patriots have used to end their slavery to the corrupt
[1:53:39.680 --> 1:53:45.040]  electricity monopoly the video at Exposed123.com has already been banned by
[1:53:45.040 --> 1:53:49.000]  Google and the liberal media is doing everything in its power to take it down
[1:53:49.000 --> 1:53:54.640]  and keep America in the dark so watch it now at Exposed123.com before it's too
[1:53:54.640 --> 1:54:00.000]  late again that's Exposed123.com
[1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:15.680]  All right we're back this is the Alex Jones show thank you for joining us today
[1:54:15.680 --> 1:54:20.040]  I hope you're enjoying all of the information our job is to inform you to
[1:54:20.040 --> 1:54:24.080]  do a little bit of entertainment but mostly inform you of the things that
[1:54:24.080 --> 1:54:28.920]  matter that really matter in your life and feeding yourself is key because if
[1:54:28.920 --> 1:54:33.720]  you don't have food freedom you are essentially a slave and a lot of people
[1:54:33.720 --> 1:54:37.280]  come into aquaponics which is the subject of our continuing interview here
[1:54:37.280 --> 1:54:41.720]  with Rob Nash of Austinaquaponics.com a lot of people come to it from a
[1:54:41.720 --> 1:54:45.520]  point of view of freedom others come to it from a point of view of health others
[1:54:45.520 --> 1:54:48.760]  just want to save money on their groceries some just want to tinker with
[1:54:48.760 --> 1:54:52.240]  food and grow grow their own medicine and not have you know the government
[1:54:52.240 --> 1:54:56.120]  tell them what they can or can't buy in terms of medicine so there are lots of
[1:54:56.120 --> 1:54:59.480]  reasons to get into it but when I was there at your class there Rob because
[1:54:59.480 --> 1:55:03.640]  I I took your your training course and I'd like to train with you more by the
[1:55:03.640 --> 1:55:08.640]  way there I saw a really nice mix of people some people everybody had
[1:55:08.640 --> 1:55:12.400]  already been into some kind of food but there was one couple there that was
[1:55:12.400 --> 1:55:16.480]  part of an e-commerce company they're like high-tech people who were getting
[1:55:16.480 --> 1:55:23.600]  into self-reliant food are you seeing like a big diverse cross of you know
[1:55:23.600 --> 1:55:26.400]  all kinds of people who were interested in it absolutely I would say
[1:55:26.400 --> 1:55:31.280]  primarily a few years ago really it was kind of the college student crowd the
[1:55:31.280 --> 1:55:34.200]  ones that were recent you know heavy into research obviously into healthy
[1:55:34.200 --> 1:55:39.920]  eating and local the local for movement but now it's really spread like you said
[1:55:39.920 --> 1:55:44.040]  a wide diverse crowd I'd say the baby boomers are probably out doing the
[1:55:44.040 --> 1:55:47.400]  college crowd at this point because you know how they are they get locked in on
[1:55:47.400 --> 1:55:52.200]  any subject and all of a sudden you know that's their new focus but you do see a
[1:55:52.200 --> 1:55:56.640]  lot of diversity that's interesting because I think also aquaponics is less
[1:55:56.640 --> 1:56:01.480]  physically demanding than soil gardening by far yeah and one of the concerns I've
[1:56:01.480 --> 1:56:06.480]  had about a lot of people who are we call preppers or survivalists that they
[1:56:06.480 --> 1:56:10.640]  they're buying seeds which is very important it's very you know it's a
[1:56:10.640 --> 1:56:15.080]  great strategy but if you've never really gone out there and sowed those
[1:56:15.080 --> 1:56:18.720]  seeds and grown food and pulled the weeds you're not gonna be able to just jump
[1:56:18.720 --> 1:56:23.480]  into it and do it overnight it's hard work sure so aquaponics is sort of it's
[1:56:23.480 --> 1:56:27.000]  an easier thing you can ease into now and you can do it even when you're you
[1:56:27.000 --> 1:56:30.560]  know an elderly person you can handle it no problem yeah literally there's
[1:56:30.560 --> 1:56:34.480]  really no heavy lifting involved once you've got your media in your beds you
[1:56:34.480 --> 1:56:37.440]  know the biggest thing you're gonna lift would be to say a 20 pound tomato plant
[1:56:37.440 --> 1:56:42.680]  if you let it go that far yeah so you had a tomato plant that was like 20 feet
[1:56:42.680 --> 1:56:46.640]  tall that you had strong almost like a vine yeah and I think there are three
[1:56:46.640 --> 1:56:50.720]  weeks ago so we're at about 26 or eight feet at this point that's insane yeah
[1:56:50.720 --> 1:56:54.000]  they get incredible growth a lot of people don't realize that in this system
[1:56:54.000 --> 1:56:58.080]  because the nutrient density is so high the plant density can also be much much
[1:56:58.080 --> 1:57:02.800]  higher so in the same square footage you can grow why 300% more food well they
[1:57:02.800 --> 1:57:07.400]  say you can safely plant your plants at least twice as close as what is
[1:57:07.400 --> 1:57:11.160]  recommended so if it says one foot you can do them every six inches literally
[1:57:11.160 --> 1:57:14.040]  the plants just aren't fighting for nutrients like you said so their root
[1:57:14.040 --> 1:57:17.000]  base doesn't have to reach as far and there's really no issue with that
[1:57:17.000 --> 1:57:20.680]  really what becomes is just that there's plenty of room for the plant to grow
[1:57:20.680 --> 1:57:24.240]  that it actually has access to the sunlight and there's room for fruit to
[1:57:24.240 --> 1:57:28.520]  you know to be harvested so gotta have the light of course but this also works
[1:57:28.520 --> 1:57:32.280]  in almost any climate because you know here in Texas where we all are trying
[1:57:32.280 --> 1:57:36.320]  to get rid of heat right you can do that with the right shade cloths and
[1:57:36.320 --> 1:57:40.240]  systems like that but in northern climates all you need is a covering you
[1:57:40.240 --> 1:57:44.520]  can grow food year-round in aquaponics that's correct by heating the water a
[1:57:44.520 --> 1:57:48.760]  bit you can keep the plant roots happy and that'll you know basically trick the
[1:57:48.760 --> 1:57:52.720]  plant into believing it's not as cold as it is outside good point it's not the
[1:57:52.720 --> 1:57:56.000]  leaf temperature it's not the ambient air temperature that really affects the
[1:57:56.000 --> 1:57:59.080]  production of the plant it's the root temperature correct yeah they say the
[1:57:59.080 --> 1:58:04.000]  root zone is the brains of the plant if you will and so again by keeping it
[1:58:04.000 --> 1:58:07.560]  warm the rest of the plant just keeps on metabolizing its sugars and whatnot and
[1:58:07.560 --> 1:58:10.440]  so you get this vibrant growth now a lot of people listening I know they're
[1:58:10.440 --> 1:58:13.480]  probably they've got a lot of questions but oh and we're gonna go to break here
[1:58:13.480 --> 1:58:16.920]  in a second but you can even grow sweet potatoes in these systems right yes
[1:58:16.920 --> 1:58:22.120]  correct almost anything but white potatoes and or carrots you know the
[1:58:22.120 --> 1:58:25.080]  carrots don't physically they don't really like to push their way around in
[1:58:25.080 --> 1:58:29.400]  the heavy medias okay well we'll be back with one more segment with Rob Nash
[1:58:29.400 --> 1:58:32.240]  here this is the Alice Jones show we've got a special report coming up in the
[1:58:32.240 --> 1:58:36.440]  next hour by Alice Jones so stay with us we'll be right back after this break
[1:58:36.440 --> 1:58:39.440]  with much more

[1:59:00.840 --> 1:59:05.320]  you have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95 percent of
[1:59:05.320 --> 1:59:09.320]  hydrofluorosalicylic acid advanced manufacturing technology combines
[1:59:09.320 --> 1:59:14.200]  silver impregnated white ceramic with new aqua medics advanced media for
[1:59:14.200 --> 1:59:18.320]  removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element it is
[1:59:18.320 --> 1:59:22.960]  the only one that does it and out of the gates we have it discounted at 10% off
[1:59:22.960 --> 1:59:28.720]  with promo code water this is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or

[1:59:51.880 --> 2:00:06.600]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network big brother
[2:00:06.600 --> 2:00:13.880]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's
[2:00:13.880 --> 2:00:21.720]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[2:00:21.720 --> 2:00:27.440]  all right we're back folks this is the third hour this is the Alex Jones show
[2:00:27.440 --> 2:00:33.160]  Mike Adams the health ranger filling in for Alex guest hosting with Alex today
[2:00:33.160 --> 2:00:39.720]  he was in here in the first couple of hours and man yeah he's rightly animated
[2:00:39.720 --> 2:00:43.240]  about what's going on today a lot of craziness in the world but here to bring
[2:00:43.240 --> 2:00:49.280]  some sanity to to all of our minds is Rob Nash from Austin aquaponics.com
[2:00:49.280 --> 2:00:54.760]  who's continuing to teach us about aquaponics a technology a decentralized
[2:00:54.760 --> 2:00:58.760]  self-replicating peer-to-peer food technology system that I'm really
[2:00:58.760 --> 2:01:03.800]  excited about and along those lines when I say peer-to-peer what I'm referring
[2:01:03.800 --> 2:01:08.560]  to is your suggestion that we should share worms and share the bacteria in the
[2:01:08.560 --> 2:01:13.200]  soil and help our neighbors get going with their systems. Sure well and on that
[2:01:13.200 --> 2:01:17.200]  note you know these systems do take a while to mature like you said there is
[2:01:17.200 --> 2:01:21.440]  three things we're growing fish plants and bacteria. Bacteria are present in
[2:01:21.440 --> 2:01:25.000]  nature and they'll show up just out of the blue but it's like a friendship
[2:01:25.000 --> 2:01:30.240]  bread if you were to introduce just a small piece of the gravel or the worms
[2:01:30.240 --> 2:01:36.080]  for an inoculant their system will be ready for this vigor faster. Absolutely
[2:01:36.080 --> 2:01:39.560]  yeah and that's the interesting part about this is your system won't really
[2:01:39.560 --> 2:01:43.080]  function correctly until the bacteria have multiplied to the point where they
[2:01:43.080 --> 2:01:48.160]  can convert ammonia to nitrite and then to nitrate. You really have been doing
[2:01:48.160 --> 2:01:52.600]  your homework. Yes I took your class I'm telling you you got it. Awesome yeah so
[2:01:52.600 --> 2:01:57.200]  and that and there's two different basic strains of bacteria one converts ammonia
[2:01:57.200 --> 2:02:00.760]  to nitrate and the other converts nitrate to nitrate so you got to allow
[2:02:00.760 --> 2:02:04.080]  that to happen and then it's ready. That's correct yeah you don't really just
[2:02:04.080 --> 2:02:09.120]  start by growing some fish in a bucket and then feeding that water to plants
[2:02:09.120 --> 2:02:14.640]  like you said the fish waste is basically almost pure ammonia which has
[2:02:14.640 --> 2:02:18.320]  not been official to a plant in fact it's probably harmful yeah but once you
[2:02:18.320 --> 2:02:22.280]  have the established bacteria to convert that to a nitrite and then a nitrate
[2:02:22.280 --> 2:02:27.360]  then you actually have an ammonium nitrate or straight fertilizer and as
[2:02:27.360 --> 2:02:30.920]  well don't let the government hear you say ammonium nitrate well you're gonna
[2:02:30.920 --> 2:02:35.320]  say that a little loose ammonium nitrate would be a bad byproduct of having
[2:02:35.320 --> 2:02:40.600]  too low of a pH so you're right let's not call that the end result that we're
[2:02:40.600 --> 2:02:45.240]  shooting they will call aquaponics terrorism very soon right how dare you
[2:02:45.240 --> 2:02:50.040]  you're producing explosives well you will have an explosive garden I can say
[2:02:50.040 --> 2:02:53.800]  that they were to go to our about us page and look at the pictures of the
[2:02:53.800 --> 2:02:58.400]  giant kale that's one of the photos we those comments of and you want to talk
[2:02:58.400 --> 2:03:01.840]  about some explosive growth oh there it is if you scroll down just a little bit
[2:03:01.840 --> 2:03:07.120]  down there there's the it is probably the picture that it that is my keep going
[2:03:07.120 --> 2:03:11.800]  guys oh there it is dinosaur kale look it's like taller than you my wife's
[2:03:11.800 --> 2:03:17.400]  caption to that picture is honey I shrunk you the kale plants that's crazy
[2:03:17.400 --> 2:03:21.120]  and a lot of people would assume that those plants probably were very tough
[2:03:21.120 --> 2:03:27.360]  or bitter honestly those are some of the nicest and most tender kale leaves I've
[2:03:27.360 --> 2:03:32.200]  ever produced oh and those are loaded with nutrition and anti-cancer nutrients
[2:03:32.200 --> 2:03:36.000]  all kinds of things yeah kale is one of the latest to be doomed deemed a super
[2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:39.000]  food yes and we just can't grow enough of it the demand out there is
[2:03:39.000 --> 2:03:43.280]  incredible oh I agree and so you're you are essentially in that picture for those
[2:03:43.280 --> 2:03:47.360]  of you on the radio you can see this on prison planet TV if you're a member that
[2:03:47.360 --> 2:03:52.880]  picture it's like you're actually growing money and medicine on trees I
[2:03:52.880 --> 2:03:58.120]  mean true it's like growing revenue and health I would say that kale has been
[2:03:58.120 --> 2:04:03.360]  one of the best products in our entire efforts nice each of those plants there
[2:04:03.360 --> 2:04:07.720]  was probably worth you know anywhere from 12 to 35 dollars just if I were to
[2:04:07.720 --> 2:04:11.480]  harvest is that one plant and they keep growing and come back and harvest again
[2:04:11.480 --> 2:04:15.280]  next week now those right there were probably two months overdue to be
[2:04:15.280 --> 2:04:19.440]  harvested yeah back in the days when I had more kale than I did market which is
[2:04:19.440 --> 2:04:23.840]  absolutely not the case today so you could you could grow like a unlimited
[2:04:23.840 --> 2:04:26.760]  quantities of kale probably and find buyers right now absolutely and with
[2:04:26.760 --> 2:04:29.760]  this local movement that really is an effect you know people been talking
[2:04:29.760 --> 2:04:34.440]  about this local war movement for years now almost six or so that I know of but
[2:04:34.440 --> 2:04:37.560]  I would say right now there's more restaurants and local distributors
[2:04:37.560 --> 2:04:40.680]  clamoring for local produce all this should be because this is what makes
[2:04:40.680 --> 2:04:44.160]  their food taste good look good nice texture better nutrition you name it
[2:04:44.160 --> 2:04:49.720]  Rob Nash we are out of time but Austin aquaponics.com has now been
[2:04:49.720 --> 2:04:52.880]  officially crashed your website is down really because of the audience yes I'm
[2:04:52.880 --> 2:04:57.280]  sorry to say that my friend but thanks for joining us today great to have you

[2:06:08.440 --> 2:06:12.760]  research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our
[2:06:12.760 --> 2:06:16.160]  crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are
[2:06:16.160 --> 2:06:21.440]  almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements

[2:08:13.160 --> 2:08:19.640]  network and the world is getting more insane by the day a recent public
[2:08:19.640 --> 2:08:27.280]  policy poll revealed that as many as 37% of those pulled believe global warming
[2:08:27.280 --> 2:08:31.880]  to be a hoax one in four Americans thinks Obama may be the Antichrist so
[2:08:31.880 --> 2:08:35.960]  actually this information is getting out there and a significant percentage I
[2:08:35.960 --> 2:08:41.160]  think it roughly up to 50% could entertain the idea that there is a new
[2:08:41.160 --> 2:08:46.600]  world order that is attempting to run the the globe and the finances and the
[2:08:46.600 --> 2:08:50.280]  countries and everything but of course the mainstream media denies that no
[2:08:50.280 --> 2:08:54.480]  there there are no conspiracies no people never get together in secret rooms
[2:08:54.480 --> 2:08:58.080]  and plan to carry things out no such thing as a conspiracy there are no
[2:08:58.080 --> 2:09:02.840]  bullets the HS isn't purchasing bullets none of that so here to answer that is
[2:09:02.840 --> 2:09:07.000]  a special report by Alex Jones it's called proof the new world order exists
[2:09:07.000 --> 2:09:12.000]  this is a special report we're gonna go to it right now so enjoy this report
[2:09:12.000 --> 2:09:16.880]  rolling eyes public policy polling has conducted an extensive poll
[2:09:16.880 --> 2:09:22.800]  investigating Republicans and Democrats belief in the conspiracy theories now
[2:09:22.800 --> 2:09:28.480]  the term conspiracy theory is used to simply demonize people who do not trust
[2:09:28.480 --> 2:09:33.240]  known liars how many times have big corporations and governments been caught
[2:09:33.240 --> 2:09:40.200]  lying secret medical experiments lies about WMD's the list goes on and on and
[2:09:40.200 --> 2:09:45.440]  the corporate collaborator media that works with the government continually
[2:09:45.440 --> 2:09:51.800]  demonizes anyone that says that they're a corrupt special interest trying to use
[2:09:51.800 --> 2:09:58.040]  government to oppress and rob the population but $85 billion a month for
[2:09:58.040 --> 2:10:03.760]  years is given to foreign offshore banks of US taxpayer money I mean that's in
[2:10:03.760 --> 2:10:10.760]  the news their clips on CNBC where they admit that we're now under the control
[2:10:10.760 --> 2:10:17.000]  of global government run by private central banks is this global governance
[2:10:17.000 --> 2:10:22.240]  at last is it one world the central bankers in charge Jim Jim Yorio you say
[2:10:22.240 --> 2:10:26.520]  we've got some downside here a correction in the markets fine but aren't we all
[2:10:26.520 --> 2:10:30.560]  just living and dying for what the central banks do aren't we all just
[2:10:30.560 --> 2:10:34.480]  counting on the fact that there's a Bernanke putt putt and that we won't go
[2:10:34.480 --> 2:10:39.200]  any lower than say five percent down from here of course we have to answer
[2:10:39.200 --> 2:10:43.840]  your question we are absolutely slaves to central banks mr. LeCamp do we work
[2:10:43.840 --> 2:10:50.600]  for the central bank we know that mr. LeCamp we do this is a free we do that's
[2:10:50.600 --> 2:10:55.280]  how the ultra rich actually get most of their money is using government to
[2:10:55.280 --> 2:10:59.560]  consolidate the general populations money and give it to themselves in
[2:10:59.560 --> 2:11:05.040]  corporate welfare and bailouts so of course they're paid for media that they
[2:11:05.040 --> 2:11:09.720]  own is going to sit there and lie to the viewers you have to understand
[2:11:09.720 --> 2:11:14.680]  something the public policy polling group comes out and says do you believe in
[2:11:14.680 --> 2:11:20.160]  the conspiracy theory of world government and a corrupt cabal that wants
[2:11:20.160 --> 2:11:26.440]  to take over the very way they phrase that oh the do you believe the conspiracy
[2:11:26.440 --> 2:11:31.240]  theory just like they ask do you believe in the conspiracy theory that
[2:11:31.240 --> 2:11:35.000]  billions of bullets have been bought do you believe in the conspiracy theory
[2:11:35.000 --> 2:11:39.560]  that there are homeland security drones I don't know it was in Associated Press
[2:11:39.560 --> 2:11:44.920]  and Wired magazine that three years ago they're arresting quote poachers and
[2:11:44.920 --> 2:11:49.480]  cattle rustlers with them it's like saying do you believe in the conspiracy
[2:11:49.480 --> 2:11:54.640]  theory that the Sun came out what they're really doing is saying hey
[2:11:54.640 --> 2:11:59.640]  culturally you're not allowed to believe there's corruption and we're gonna
[2:11:59.640 --> 2:12:08.440]  ridicule you and put a label on you if you say we're liars think of the hoax of
[2:12:08.440 --> 2:12:15.360]  coming out and saying oh close to a third of Americans sadly believe there's a
[2:12:15.360 --> 2:12:20.480]  move to establish global government when the Vatican's calling for it when
[2:12:20.480 --> 2:12:25.160]  British Prime Ministers and Al Gore and the head of the European Union
[2:12:25.160 --> 2:12:30.640]  Herman von Roompi and just hundreds of others have called for a new world order
[2:12:30.640 --> 2:12:36.040]  and then they define it as a global corporate government run by private
[2:12:36.040 --> 2:12:44.000]  banks that you pay carbon taxes to but it is the awareness itself that will
[2:12:44.000 --> 2:12:49.280]  drive the change and one of the ways it will drive the change is through global
[2:12:49.280 --> 2:12:54.560]  governance and global agreements but the many business leaders who have been
[2:12:54.560 --> 2:13:02.720]  present here are among those taking leadership in other ways yet these
[2:13:02.720 --> 2:13:08.720]  problems can be overcome by a joint effort in our and between our countries
[2:13:08.720 --> 2:13:14.040]  2009 is also the first year of global governance with the establishment of a
[2:13:14.040 --> 2:13:19.880]  G20 in the middle of the financial crisis the climate conference in Copenhagen
[2:13:19.880 --> 2:13:25.440]  is another step towards the global management of our planet this is
[2:13:25.440 --> 2:13:30.600]  collective action people working together at their best I think the new
[2:13:30.600 --> 2:13:34.320]  world order is emerging and with it the foundations of a new and progressive
[2:13:34.320 --> 2:13:41.240]  era of international cooperation that's their definition in the financial
[2:13:41.240 --> 2:13:44.680]  times of London and now for world government headline written by their
[2:13:44.680 --> 2:13:48.680]  foreign desk editor that's the definition in Time magazine a bank of the
[2:13:48.680 --> 2:13:54.600]  world so I'm reporting on real things and they're saying oh no he's a dangerous
[2:13:54.600 --> 2:13:57.760]  conspiracy theorist remember Robert Gibbs the former White House press
[2:13:57.760 --> 2:14:03.440]  secretary saying he would be ordered to lie about drone programs that are on
[2:14:03.440 --> 2:14:09.000]  record to exist when I went through the process of becoming press secretary one
[2:14:09.000 --> 2:14:12.360]  of the things one of the first things they told me was you're not even to
[2:14:12.360 --> 2:14:18.000]  acknowledge the drone program you're not even to discuss that it exists and so I
[2:14:18.000 --> 2:14:21.480]  would get a question like that and literally I couldn't tell you what
[2:14:21.480 --> 2:14:25.520]  major asked because once I figured out it was about the drone program I realized
[2:14:25.520 --> 2:14:29.400]  I'm not supposed to talk about it and but here's what's inherently crazy about
[2:14:29.400 --> 2:14:35.560]  that proposition you're being asked a question based on reporting of a program
[2:14:35.560 --> 2:14:41.520]  that exists right so you're the official government spokesperson acting as if the
[2:14:41.520 --> 2:14:46.160]  entire program pay no attention to the man behind the curtain what's happening
[2:14:46.160 --> 2:14:51.200]  there they're counting on the public not going and looking at the documents or
[2:14:51.200 --> 2:14:56.080]  not going and finding out there really are two billion bullets or 30,000
[2:14:56.080 --> 2:15:00.160]  drones funded in the new FAA funding last year and that they're launching now
[2:15:00.160 --> 2:15:05.320]  and it's not just people like Robert Gibbs on the so-called left it's gatekeepers
[2:15:05.320 --> 2:15:09.000]  like Glenn Beck who says there are no FEMA camps even though there are official
[2:15:09.000 --> 2:15:11.760]  army documents talking about their establishment where it talks about
[2:15:11.760 --> 2:15:16.200]  reeducation and taking your social security numbers and the army confiscating
[2:15:16.200 --> 2:15:20.960]  your guns and the civilian inmate labor camp program and the emergency
[2:15:20.960 --> 2:15:25.040]  centers establishment act but Glenn Beck can just say none of that's true
[2:15:25.040 --> 2:15:30.360]  Alex Jones is a fascist he's not a conservative he's a liar and by the way
[2:15:30.360 --> 2:15:35.320]  they haven't gotten millions of bullets don't believe him it's amazing because he
[2:15:35.320 --> 2:15:40.080]  runs info wars when really smart people have come up to me and said you know I
[2:15:40.080 --> 2:15:45.000]  just saw this on something from info wars do you know what I mean I'm like yes
[2:15:45.000 --> 2:15:49.840]  yeah stay away from it immediately somebody came up to me just two days
[2:15:49.840 --> 2:15:56.720]  ago and said we just bought like 1.5 billion rounds homeland security and I
[2:15:56.720 --> 2:16:02.360]  said I don't know might be well I got it from info wars and I'm okay okay well
[2:16:02.360 --> 2:16:09.200]  then I can tell you right now it's most likely not true ladies and gentlemen if
[2:16:09.200 --> 2:16:12.680]  we can have a debate about the world government being established that's
[2:16:12.680 --> 2:16:16.840]  totally authoritarian if we can have a debate about the government arming to
[2:16:16.840 --> 2:16:21.160]  the teeth while trying to disarm us if we can have a debate about the things
[2:16:21.160 --> 2:16:25.360]  that are happening in this culture then we can change things because we have
[2:16:25.360 --> 2:16:30.280]  right on our side and the facts but we can never get to that debate because they
[2:16:30.280 --> 2:16:33.920]  just say no it isn't true and you're like well yeah it is and the debate
[2:16:33.920 --> 2:16:39.680]  becomes is it real or not what will shatter that is if you will go search
[2:16:39.680 --> 2:16:45.920]  yourself for the civilian and mate labor camp program at army.mil if you will
[2:16:45.920 --> 2:16:52.200]  go and if you will research the different data sheets that Paul Watson and
[2:16:52.200 --> 2:16:56.360]  others have put together like bankers declare US and Europe conquered that is
[2:16:56.360 --> 2:17:01.160]  full of dozens of video clips and links to establishment publications
[2:17:01.160 --> 2:17:05.600]  announcing world government as a good thing you see if you promote a
[2:17:05.600 --> 2:17:09.560]  corporate fascist world government as a good thing while you get invited to the
[2:17:09.560 --> 2:17:14.360]  council on firing relations and on CNN but if you say hey I don't want an
[2:17:14.360 --> 2:17:19.480]  unelected group of bankers looting me and taking my liberties and robbing my
[2:17:19.480 --> 2:17:24.560]  pension fund well then what are you talking about crazy man that doesn't
[2:17:24.560 --> 2:17:30.080]  exist they're playing mind games with you so as Ronald Reagan said trust me
[2:17:30.080 --> 2:17:35.680]  verify go out and check my claims find out they're true and then ask yourself
[2:17:35.680 --> 2:17:42.040]  why are they lying to you the answer is getting in their face and saying no
[2:17:42.040 --> 2:17:46.000]  because if you're watching this transmission you are the resistance
[2:17:46.000 --> 2:17:51.520]  there's not some secret cabal of good guys that are gonna save you it's me
[2:17:51.520 --> 2:17:56.760]  it's you it's us that are gonna turn the tide it's always been that way
[2:17:56.760 --> 2:18:00.960]  throughout history so don't just let the globalist dictate reality and tell you
[2:18:00.960 --> 2:18:05.160]  there's no drone program there's not two billion bullets speak out tell the truth
[2:18:05.160 --> 2:18:10.160]  show the evidence it's on the federal government's own websites and more and
[2:18:10.160 --> 2:18:13.720]  more people will start having the courage to tell the truth there are a lot
[2:18:13.720 --> 2:18:16.840]  of people in the power structure who aren't really bad but they're scared and
[2:18:16.840 --> 2:18:21.000]  isolated like Pat Robertson he's coming out more and more and criticizing
[2:18:21.000 --> 2:18:30.240]  tyranny long trains full of armored vehicles personnel carriers with armor
[2:18:30.240 --> 2:18:36.160]  what are they for the army going into battle against the enemy they're used
[2:18:36.160 --> 2:18:44.080]  by homeland security against us well Reagan said the most fearful statement
[2:18:44.080 --> 2:18:48.360]  of the English language is I'm from the government and I'm here to help you oh boy
[2:18:48.360 --> 2:18:53.920]  I told you imagine what Homeland Security is doing it's just awful but
[2:18:53.920 --> 2:18:57.880]  we're gonna talk about how much ammunition they're stockpiling who are
[2:18:57.880 --> 2:19:03.280]  they gonna shoot us I'm Alex Jones signing off for this report for info

[2:23:06.080 --> 2:23:09.520]  can control doesn't work disarming law-abiding citizens ensures that only
[2:23:09.520 --> 2:23:13.280]  criminals have guns and Rom Emanuel and the Chicago machine want to keep it
[2:23:13.280 --> 2:23:16.760]  that way if we can't stop them in Chicago we may lose the whole battle but

[2:23:27.560 --> 2:23:31.040]  need to keep their hands off our guns illa door Republican Paul McKinley is
[2:23:31.040 --> 2:23:34.320]  sending that message in a bitterly fought special election to replace

[2:24:07.640 --> 2:24:18.480]  all right welcome back to the Alex Jones show Mike Adams the health ranger
[2:24:18.480 --> 2:24:23.920]  filling in today as the guest host for Alex what an incredible show we've had
[2:24:23.920 --> 2:24:26.960]  already let me go through a few headlines for you very quickly and then
[2:24:26.960 --> 2:24:32.120]  we're going to our guest Dane Wiggington of geoengineeringwatch.org and thank you
[2:24:32.120 --> 2:24:35.920]  by the way all of you listeners out there thank you for being so responsive
[2:24:35.920 --> 2:24:38.800]  that you have now crashed the websites of the first two guests that we already
[2:24:38.800 --> 2:24:46.960]  had my sights down it's crashed yes that's what happens info wars really
[2:24:46.960 --> 2:24:51.440]  does have a huge reach even though the White House just it drives them nuts
[2:24:51.440 --> 2:24:55.040]  that there is such a thing as independent media I hear some of the
[2:24:55.040 --> 2:24:58.920]  headlines cancer clinics are turning away thousands of Medicare patients this
[2:24:58.920 --> 2:25:03.760]  is the headline on Drudge right now and this is the beginning of health care
[2:25:03.760 --> 2:25:09.000]  rationing under Obamacare so if you have cancer and you want treatment well too
[2:25:09.000 --> 2:25:13.080]  bad what's happened is the government under Obamacare has reduced the
[2:25:13.080 --> 2:25:18.040]  reimbursement rates for cancer treatment so much that the cancer clinics will go
[2:25:18.040 --> 2:25:22.640]  broke treating patients so they're just turning them away and saying sorry no
[2:25:22.640 --> 2:25:27.360]  cancer treatment for you remember during the debate about Obamacare when we were
[2:25:27.360 --> 2:25:30.560]  promised by the Democrats that no that would never happen in America
[2:25:30.560 --> 2:25:34.920]  everybody will get care it won't be like the UK it won't be like that at all
[2:25:34.920 --> 2:25:38.960]  everybody's gonna get their care well there you go once again info wars proven
[2:25:38.960 --> 2:25:44.080]  correct again and again and again it just keeps happening because info wars
[2:25:44.080 --> 2:25:48.360]  reports on reality that's what that special report was just about with Alex
[2:25:48.360 --> 2:25:53.480]  Jones is about waking up to reality and not living in the delusional fabrication
[2:25:53.480 --> 2:25:59.120]  world that is inserted into your head by mainstream media and the Winehouse now
[2:25:59.120 --> 2:26:03.280]  there's another great story on info wars I saw it yesterday by Curt Nimmo I
[2:26:03.280 --> 2:26:09.880]  don't recall the title but it's it quotes David Stockman who who wrote a
[2:26:09.880 --> 2:26:13.720]  very important article in the New York Times an opinion piece called state
[2:26:13.720 --> 2:26:19.360]  wrecked the corruption of capitalism in America this article is brilliant I'm
[2:26:19.360 --> 2:26:23.080]  astonished the New York Times even published it it's absolutely brilliant
[2:26:23.080 --> 2:26:27.280]  I want to encourage you to check this out in that David Stockman breaks down and
[2:26:27.280 --> 2:26:30.800]  also curtain him Curt Nimmo's article summarizes this so you might find that
[2:26:30.800 --> 2:26:35.400]  info wars calm but the stockman breaks down what is happening and why there
[2:26:35.400 --> 2:26:39.400]  will not be another big financial bailout the bailouts are are over the
[2:26:39.400 --> 2:26:44.320]  big banks for bailouts in America will no longer work the collapse is coming is
[2:26:44.320 --> 2:26:48.680]  what he says I'm paraphrasing but he gives a lot of details and this is the
[2:26:48.680 --> 2:26:54.160]  guy who was in the Reagan administration as a financial advisor to Reagan up I
[2:26:54.160 --> 2:26:57.920]  may not have the right title but he's he knows what he's talking about in other
[2:26:57.920 --> 2:27:04.600]  news the ACLU get this says that Reed's gun control legislation could threaten
[2:27:04.600 --> 2:27:10.760]  privacy rights and civil liberties so now we've got resistance on the on senator
[2:27:10.760 --> 2:27:16.440]  Harry Reed's gun bill from the ACLU they're concerned about this national
[2:27:16.440 --> 2:27:22.400]  gun registration list idea which is essentially well I'm sorry universal
[2:27:22.400 --> 2:27:27.400]  background check idea which is essentially a gun registration system so
[2:27:27.400 --> 2:27:31.280]  universal background checks is how the government plans to build a database of
[2:27:31.280 --> 2:27:34.760]  who owns guns and where they live and you can only imagine what they want to do
[2:27:34.760 --> 2:27:39.320]  with that and now even the ACLU is waking up and saying you know this is an
[2:27:39.320 --> 2:27:43.760]  invasion of your privacy and certainly it violates the Second Amendment which
[2:27:43.760 --> 2:27:48.200]  says that your right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed and tracking
[2:27:48.200 --> 2:27:54.280]  you would be an infringement of course tens of thousands of Obamacare
[2:27:54.280 --> 2:27:58.600]  navigators to be hired to help you navigate the complexity of the Obamacare
[2:27:58.600 --> 2:28:02.400]  system that is going to deny you coverage if you have cancer how's that for
[2:28:02.400 --> 2:28:06.880]  fun so now this is the government's new job creation program to have thousands
[2:28:06.880 --> 2:28:11.600]  of people helping you decode the highly complex Obamacare healthcare bill that
[2:28:11.600 --> 2:28:14.840]  no one even read before they passed it remember what Pelosi said we have to
[2:28:14.840 --> 2:28:17.040]  pass the bill so we can find out what's in it
[2:28:17.040 --> 2:28:23.080]  wonderful system a Bitcoin exchange was recently hacked causing prices to
[2:28:23.080 --> 2:28:26.320]  temporarily tumble but they're still way way higher than they were just two
[2:28:26.320 --> 2:28:31.320]  weeks ago and well that's it for the headlines let's go to our guest actually
[2:28:31.320 --> 2:28:35.280]  I'm sorry we're gonna go to break here in just a minute so let me just give a
[2:28:35.280 --> 2:28:40.160]  brief intro his name is Dane Wiggington he's the creator of geoengineering watch
[2:28:40.160 --> 2:28:45.400]  dot org and I've never interviewed Dane before but he's been on coast to coast
[2:28:45.400 --> 2:28:49.360]  with George Norrie and others and he seems to know his stuff on geo
[2:28:49.360 --> 2:28:53.600]  engineering and I'm gonna specifically ask him about what's really going on with
[2:28:53.600 --> 2:28:57.240]  chemtrails what's going on with wet weather modification which we know is
[2:28:57.240 --> 2:29:03.040]  happening I mean it's it's openly written up in you know science magazines in
[2:29:03.040 --> 2:29:06.480]  the Middle East that they're using it to bring rain to some of the cities there
[2:29:06.480 --> 2:29:12.560]  I'm gonna ask him about what this means for the future of our ecosystem that
[2:29:12.560 --> 2:29:17.800]  produces our food so could this could the the ways that the governments are
[2:29:17.800 --> 2:29:22.680]  messing with the weather could that cause more droughts more floods more
[2:29:22.680 --> 2:29:27.720]  storms more food collapse all around us which is the reason why I talked about
[2:29:27.720 --> 2:29:31.280]  aquaponics so much in this show because if you're not growing your own food
[2:29:31.280 --> 2:29:37.240]  you're not free even if you have guns and ammo and gold and silver you got to
[2:29:37.240 --> 2:29:40.960]  feed yourself and you can't eat gold folks gold is great but you also need to
[2:29:40.960 --> 2:29:44.400]  be able to stay alive while you have it so stay with us we'll be right back after
[2:29:44.400 --> 2:29:48.000]  this break with Dane Wiggington from geoengineeringwatch.org this is Mike

[2:33:12.440 --> 2:33:17.840]  listening to the Alex Jones show all right we're back on the Alex Jones show
[2:33:17.840 --> 2:33:22.320]  real quick before we go to our guests a grand jury has indicted Antonio Bueller
[2:33:22.320 --> 2:33:29.360]  here in Austin for the supposed crime of filming police so let's see in Austin
[2:33:29.360 --> 2:33:34.480]  we've been threatened with having infowars bumper stickers on our cars been
[2:33:34.480 --> 2:33:37.800]  told it's illegal to hand out magazines on a sidewalk even when you're not
[2:33:37.800 --> 2:33:42.560]  blocking the walkway and it's now illegal to film police now they can film
[2:33:42.560 --> 2:33:47.640]  you because there's no expectation of privacy but if you film them well then
[2:33:47.640 --> 2:33:52.140]  you're gonna be arrested and indicted and this has just happened he's now
[2:33:52.140 --> 2:33:57.040]  facing several misdemeanors or quote defying lawful orders but it's not a
[2:33:57.040 --> 2:34:03.520]  lawful order to tell a citizen you can't film police so you know look all I want
[2:34:03.520 --> 2:34:10.800]  and all I think Alex wants is the restoration of actual law and liberties
[2:34:10.800 --> 2:34:14.480]  that is the Constitution Bill of Rights the restoration of law in America the
[2:34:14.480 --> 2:34:20.240]  way it was written and we are not anti-government we are anti-criminals
[2:34:20.240 --> 2:34:25.080]  in government we would love a constitutional government to be run in
[2:34:25.080 --> 2:34:30.240]  the show we are pro-government we're not anti we're anti-criminal that's we're
[2:34:30.240 --> 2:34:35.840]  anti-corruption we're anti eugenics we are anti deception we are anti
[2:34:35.840 --> 2:34:44.280]  disinfo propaganda we are anti dehumanizing toxic chemical GMOs vaccines
[2:34:44.280 --> 2:34:48.360]  with mercury all that kind of stuff we are pro-constitutional government
[2:34:48.360 --> 2:34:53.080]  running running its limited role in America and pro-liberty at the same
[2:34:53.080 --> 2:34:58.360]  time so now with that said let's go to our guest Dane Wiggington who is the
[2:34:58.360 --> 2:35:02.640]  creator of geoengineeringwatch.org a very interesting website let's hope
[2:35:02.640 --> 2:35:07.560]  that's one website that we won't crash today so anyway Dane joins us by phone
[2:35:07.560 --> 2:35:11.160]  thank you Dane and welcome to the Alex Jones show. Thanks Mike thanks for
[2:35:11.160 --> 2:35:13.840]  addressing the issue and just to correct the record I want to give credit to
[2:35:13.840 --> 2:35:17.640]  Mauro Oliveira for originally starting the site and Yvonne Noctigal a great
[2:35:17.640 --> 2:35:21.320]  great gal who without which we would have no site but okay I'm sorry about
[2:35:21.320 --> 2:35:25.080]  that you're running the site. They're great people I just want to want to make sure they
[2:35:25.080 --> 2:35:28.400]  know what we give them credit because they deserve it. Yeah I give credit where
[2:35:28.400 --> 2:35:33.200]  it's due absolutely. On this issue of geoengineering and the ramifications of
[2:35:33.200 --> 2:35:37.720]  people truly understood stood the gravity of this issue Mike everyone
[2:35:37.720 --> 2:35:41.440]  would carry this torch because as you stated before the break people's
[2:35:41.440 --> 2:35:46.240]  provisions won't do them any good if they're not able to feed themselves
[2:35:46.240 --> 2:35:50.280]  those provisions won't do them any good either if they continue to inhale this
[2:35:50.280 --> 2:35:56.280]  toxic metal laden air that each and every one of us is breathing and if we
[2:35:56.280 --> 2:35:58.960]  continue to be exposed to these particulates from the geoengineering
[2:35:58.960 --> 2:36:03.480]  fallout we will not be firing on all neurons for much longer and we're
[2:36:03.480 --> 2:36:07.280]  seeing the effects of that already with the autism and Alzheimer's reports from
[2:36:07.280 --> 2:36:11.760]  two weeks back I mean these particulates are bioaccumulative they are in every
[2:36:11.760 --> 2:36:16.360]  breath we take if they continue to spray we will have nothing to care about in
[2:36:16.360 --> 2:36:19.560]  very short order. Tell us about the chemical composition I've heard of
[2:36:19.560 --> 2:36:25.000]  barium salts aluminum what what really is being found in these things that are
[2:36:25.000 --> 2:36:29.040]  being spread. Again people need to understand that these particulates are
[2:36:29.040 --> 2:36:34.920]  not coming from the wind blowing or industrial sources these are new levels
[2:36:34.920 --> 2:36:38.400]  of particulates and industrial sources have been eliminated from much of the
[2:36:38.400 --> 2:36:42.080]  testing and again there's simply nowhere else they can come from in the case of
[2:36:42.080 --> 2:36:46.320]  the the amounts of aluminum and barium that we're seeing in tests along the
[2:36:46.320 --> 2:36:50.920]  west coast we've seen single rain events might escalate in six to seven year
[2:36:50.920 --> 2:36:55.720]  period in the case of aluminum as much as 50,000 percent from seven parts per
[2:36:55.720 --> 2:37:00.680]  billion to 3,450 parts per billion in a single rain event many want to leap to
[2:37:00.680 --> 2:37:05.520]  the conclusion that this is coming from China. CARB California Air Resources
[2:37:05.520 --> 2:37:09.320]  Board has done studies in the aerosols from China metals don't float across
[2:37:09.320 --> 2:37:14.040]  oceans these these toxins are new they're coming down and it's such extreme
[2:37:14.040 --> 2:37:19.080]  amounts that they're actually changing forest floor pHs 10 to 15 times toward
[2:37:19.080 --> 2:37:22.840]  alkaline in the Pacific Northwest so it takes a lot of metal to actually change
[2:37:22.840 --> 2:37:26.600]  the pH of the forest. Oh yeah. What what are they doing to us and each and every
[2:37:26.600 --> 2:37:31.080]  breath again it's actually killing trees so certainly the bio cumulative effect
[2:37:31.080 --> 2:37:34.600]  on us is has has to be horrific at this point and all the medical stats seem to
[2:37:34.600 --> 2:37:37.680]  bear that out. You know Dane I have to concur with much of what you're saying
[2:37:37.680 --> 2:37:42.000]  here I'm you know I'm I'm the health ranger the editor of natural news but I
[2:37:42.000 --> 2:37:47.360]  also oversee the raw materials acquisition for our own certified
[2:37:47.360 --> 2:37:52.040]  organic manufacturing and retailing operation and we are having to reject a
[2:37:52.040 --> 2:37:57.440]  lot of raw materials now because we're detecting unacceptably high levels of
[2:37:57.440 --> 2:38:01.680]  aluminum in the materials I'm talking about you know food superfood plant
[2:38:01.680 --> 2:38:05.760]  materials whatever we're finding it's alarming and we have to reject a lot of
[2:38:05.760 --> 2:38:11.680]  suppliers. Well certainly the metals there that's not a debate and it's not
[2:38:11.680 --> 2:38:15.320]  speculation in any sense we're seeing other things in the mix too Mike there's
[2:38:15.320 --> 2:38:19.520]  researchers from Norway and Germany that have contacted us some time back the
[2:38:19.520 --> 2:38:24.520]  last 60 rain tests they have done there have been laden with fluoride they've
[2:38:24.520 --> 2:38:28.680]  eliminated industrial sources. Crazy. The conclusion is that now fluoride appears
[2:38:28.680 --> 2:38:32.360]  to be in the mix and there are some potential weathermine aspects of
[2:38:32.360 --> 2:38:36.720]  fluoride as well in relationship to harp in the when when these particles are
[2:38:36.720 --> 2:38:40.920]  exposed to certain radio frequency signals they coagulate and can cause
[2:38:40.920 --> 2:38:43.800]  precipitation to come back down I mean there there are some intricacies that
[2:38:43.800 --> 2:38:48.480]  fluoride might be used in addition to exposing the human population which may
[2:38:48.480 --> 2:38:52.000]  be one of their goals as well. Well let's sorry to interrupt Dame but let's talk
[2:38:52.000 --> 2:38:56.160]  about that for those who might be new to the issue what are really you think the
[2:38:56.160 --> 2:39:00.920]  goals of spraying these things I mean what is the goal what what's the end game
[2:39:00.920 --> 2:39:06.320]  of this why would they do it? Again I think there's a number of layers to that
[2:39:06.320 --> 2:39:09.920]  onion there's military strategic purposes we have the document owning the
[2:39:09.920 --> 2:39:13.960]  weather by the US military obvious strategic purposes at this point there
[2:39:13.960 --> 2:39:16.720]  does appear to be weather warfare going on around the globe you have the NATO
[2:39:16.720 --> 2:39:20.520]  powers on one side of the equation you have China Russia on the other you have
[2:39:20.520 --> 2:39:24.400]  examples like Pakistan when Pakistan started to show resistance to the US
[2:39:24.400 --> 2:39:28.600]  suddenly they find their country 20% of water same with Thailand but they
[2:39:28.600 --> 2:39:32.120]  refused the US an air base there that the Thai government felt was for weather
[2:39:32.120 --> 2:39:36.440]  modification that record flooding occurs there so there's military strategic
[2:39:36.440 --> 2:39:42.040]  purposes there's also food control water control we see the moisture flow being
[2:39:42.040 --> 2:39:47.000]  cut off to much of the US by blanket spraying of the eastern Pacific we post
[2:39:47.000 --> 2:39:50.080]  satellite imagery of that we're not guessing we see their blanket spraying we
[2:39:50.080 --> 2:39:53.880]  know the scientific effect is to to reduce the hydrological cycle waters
[2:39:53.880 --> 2:39:57.880]  cut off then water rights are pursued that's happening right now so it's the
[2:39:57.880 --> 2:40:02.720]  disaster capitalism act all over then you have toxification of soils that
[2:40:02.720 --> 2:40:11.320]  renders seeds almost infertile except for the DuPont aluminum resistance
[2:40:11.320 --> 2:40:15.720]  seeds that are now being pushed so again food control water control military
[2:40:15.720 --> 2:40:20.200]  strategic purposes and quite simply a population that's sick doesn't protest
[2:40:20.200 --> 2:40:24.040]  much and we are all getting sick whether we realize it or not whether we admit
[2:40:24.040 --> 2:40:28.120]  it or not it is happening well this is aluminum to kill a forest enough metal
[2:40:28.120 --> 2:40:33.000]  barium strontium to kill forest trees will certainly kill us eventually absolutely
[2:40:33.000 --> 2:40:37.280]  and this also reiterates the importance of something I mentioned on the show
[2:40:37.280 --> 2:40:43.840]  here before which is we're gonna have to grow food in greenhouses because you you
[2:40:43.840 --> 2:40:48.000]  if your food is subjected to what's falling out of the sky that's being
[2:40:48.000 --> 2:40:52.400]  sprayed then you're gonna obviously be in taking that in your food so this is
[2:40:52.400 --> 2:40:56.360]  why I've been talking about aquaponics because you need to have a food system
[2:40:56.360 --> 2:41:01.560]  that you can run yourself that's not taking in you know these these things
[2:41:01.560 --> 2:41:04.960]  these these elements that are falling out of the sky in especially in some
[2:41:04.960 --> 2:41:08.160]  areas where they're really doing the most spraying now a real quick day let me
[2:41:08.160 --> 2:41:12.720]  just give out the phone number for those who've got information about North
[2:41:12.720 --> 2:41:19.480]  Korea if you are listening from Korea South Korea in particular or Japan or
[2:41:19.480 --> 2:41:22.480]  Taiwan if you're nearby and you have information and you want to call in
[2:41:22.480 --> 2:41:25.120]  we're gonna take your calls in the last five minutes of the show today the
[2:41:25.120 --> 2:41:31.880]  number for that is 800-259-9231 and if you're international then that number is
[2:41:31.880 --> 2:41:42.040]  651-695-7777 again that number for international callers is 651-695-7777
[2:41:42.040 --> 2:41:47.520]  so please call in if you have information about what's happening there with Korea
[2:41:47.520 --> 2:41:50.880]  and we'll take your calls in the last five minutes now continuing Dane and I'm
[2:41:50.880 --> 2:41:54.840]  sorry about thank you for being flexible today we've had a lot of breaking news
[2:41:54.840 --> 2:41:57.720]  that sort of move things around so I want to want to thank you for your
[2:41:57.720 --> 2:42:01.920]  patience and your flexibility no worries go ahead with what what is the next most
[2:42:01.920 --> 2:42:04.560]  important thing that people need to know to be able to protect themselves from
[2:42:04.560 --> 2:42:08.760]  the spring well geoengineering needs to stop because there's no there's nowhere
[2:42:08.760 --> 2:42:11.160]  to hide from this quite simply if you can't walk out your door and breathe
[2:42:11.160 --> 2:42:14.200]  without sucking in a long full heavy metal we have a problem with the first
[2:42:14.200 --> 2:42:18.000]  order and again based on all available data we feel geoengineering to be the
[2:42:18.000 --> 2:42:21.480]  the greatest and most immediate threat to life on earth short of nuclear
[2:42:21.480 --> 2:42:25.120]  catastrophe it's shredding the ozone layer altering weather patterns around
[2:42:25.120 --> 2:42:29.560]  the globe blocking and in relation to growing our own food global dimming a
[2:42:29.560 --> 2:42:34.120]  term many are unfamiliar with is now thought to be fully 22% that means
[2:42:34.120 --> 2:42:38.600]  22% of the Sun's direct rays no longer reach the surface of the planet thus
[2:42:38.600 --> 2:42:42.360]  photosynthesis is dropped and the light that does come through is in an altered
[2:42:42.360 --> 2:42:46.080]  light wavelength form we don't even know what that does to photosynthesis in
[2:42:46.080 --> 2:42:50.760]  point and these toxic particulates are thwarting the entire chain of life on
[2:42:50.760 --> 2:42:55.440]  the microbial level from atmospheric microbes which we are now just beginning
[2:42:55.440 --> 2:42:59.400]  to learn about soil microbes which are literally being sterilized which allows
[2:42:59.400 --> 2:43:04.760]  fungus to move in and fill the plate so again that the web of life from bottom
[2:43:04.760 --> 2:43:08.920]  to top is being thwarted by these programs and quite simply if they
[2:43:08.920 --> 2:43:12.160]  continue we will have nothing to care about they're shredding the ozone layer
[2:43:12.160 --> 2:43:16.280]  we know that the science is clear on that and the ozone layer is so thin in
[2:43:16.280 --> 2:43:19.960]  places now Mike that we're seeing the bark literally burnt off the south side
[2:43:19.960 --> 2:43:25.040]  of native trees in the Pacific Northwest and no ozone layer no life on earth
[2:43:25.040 --> 2:43:30.160]  you know it's it's crazy don't I'm not and I'm not saying this is the case but
[2:43:30.160 --> 2:43:34.040]  it sounds like a science fiction movie where like an alien race wants to
[2:43:34.040 --> 2:43:37.520]  terraform the planet I'm not saying that I believe that's that's happening it's
[2:43:37.520 --> 2:43:41.720]  just it's just an illustration out of sci-fi but it sounds like that you know
[2:43:41.720 --> 2:43:46.600]  it's like they're changing it so much and you mentioned the pH changes if you
[2:43:46.600 --> 2:43:50.400]  change the pH of the soil you're right you're gonna create massive disease
[2:43:50.400 --> 2:43:53.880]  across all those soils and all the plants that grow in them and you're gonna
[2:43:53.880 --> 2:43:58.160]  change the nutrient uptake based on on pH you're gonna really disrupt the entire
[2:43:58.160 --> 2:44:02.560]  ecosystem based on pH alone those factors come into play but now we add
[2:44:02.560 --> 2:44:06.880]  bioavailable toxic metals in the case of aluminum we know quite a bit about
[2:44:06.880 --> 2:44:12.720]  that bioavailable aluminum causes most plant organisms to stop nutrient uptake
[2:44:12.720 --> 2:44:15.800]  we see this happening in the forest right now that the fir trees yes they have
[2:44:15.800 --> 2:44:19.640]  beetles but that's only a symptom not a cause we know the bioavailable aluminum
[2:44:19.640 --> 2:44:22.760]  there we know it's effect and we're seeing that the fallout in the forest
[2:44:22.760 --> 2:44:26.360]  trees are virtually dying everywhere we have native plants that aren't even
[2:44:26.360 --> 2:44:30.520]  sprouting now so there are so many facets to this that if the fact that every
[2:44:30.520 --> 2:44:34.680]  bit of our ability to sustain life the planet's ability to sustain life people
[2:44:34.680 --> 2:44:37.760]  understood the gravity of geoengineering like they would they would help us take
[2:44:37.760 --> 2:44:41.600]  up this torch because quickly if it doesn't stop we're very soon going to
[2:44:41.600 --> 2:44:46.040]  have nothing left to care about and on the on the human implications here you
[2:44:46.040 --> 2:44:50.640]  know the FDA will say you can you can eat a certain amount of aluminum and not
[2:44:50.640 --> 2:44:55.680]  be harmful but those numbers don't take into account inhaling the particulate
[2:44:55.680 --> 2:45:01.160]  matter okay you bring up an extremely good point inhaled metal particulates
[2:45:01.160 --> 2:45:06.320]  are much more lethal than ingested they have to be yes what is a magnitude they
[2:45:06.320 --> 2:45:10.160]  are and dr. Russell Blalock internationally recognized neuroscientist
[2:45:10.160 --> 2:45:13.800]  acknowledges this he could be found online that these particulates are so
[2:45:13.800 --> 2:45:17.680]  small 10 nanometers in range they go straight through the lung lining
[2:45:17.680 --> 2:45:20.880]  straight into the bloodstream where they adhere to cell receptors like a plaque
[2:45:20.880 --> 2:45:24.360]  and they're almost it's almost impossible to get off so it's all bio
[2:45:24.360 --> 2:45:27.600]  accumulative and this is building up in all of us again whether we admit it or
[2:45:27.600 --> 2:45:32.040]  not is irrelevant it is happening so that the the dangers posed by these
[2:45:32.040 --> 2:45:35.880]  programs cannot be overstated and certainly this would appear to possibly
[2:45:35.880 --> 2:45:39.720]  have implications for the agenda 21 that's now coming to light it's certainly a
[2:45:39.720 --> 2:45:44.360]  method of controlling food supply water supply and and it's virtually altering
[2:45:44.360 --> 2:45:49.640]  first-weather patterns so much so that now it is in fact triggering cataclysmic
[2:45:49.640 --> 2:45:54.000]  feedback mechanisms like methane mass expulsion in the Arctic which is it does
[2:45:54.000 --> 2:45:56.560]  appear to be triggered it does appear to be happening right now people should
[2:45:56.560 --> 2:46:01.320]  look up methane Arctic methane emergency and this is not about Al Gore not about
[2:46:01.320 --> 2:46:06.800]  any of Al Gore shams or or no Al Gore was just trying to hijack something for
[2:46:06.800 --> 2:46:11.960]  his own political gain exactly no Al Gore is completely discredited as far as
[2:46:11.960 --> 2:46:15.840]  I'm concerned but but you know I want to ask you a question you seem like you
[2:46:15.840 --> 2:46:19.440]  have a lot of scientific training or a scientific background I don't I don't
[2:46:19.440 --> 2:46:22.760]  really know you that well this is the first time I've interviewed you but can
[2:46:22.760 --> 2:46:25.720]  you speak to that what what is your background I have a background here
[2:46:25.720 --> 2:46:29.880]  renewable energy I'm a former Bechtel power employee and that's a four letter
[2:46:29.880 --> 2:46:33.240]  word like Halliburton at this point but I I worked on one of the first
[2:46:33.240 --> 2:46:37.600]  commercial solar plants in the continental US and that's what brought me
[2:46:37.600 --> 2:46:40.960]  to this issue I when I moved the Pacific Northwest I built a very large
[2:46:40.960 --> 2:46:44.240]  off-grid home that was on the cover of the world's largest renewable energy
[2:46:44.240 --> 2:46:49.640]  magazine and when I began to lose 50 60 70 80% of my solar PV uptake from
[2:46:49.640 --> 2:46:52.880]  whatever was happening in the sky these grid patterns on intermittent data it
[2:46:52.880 --> 2:46:57.400]  clearly something profound was going on and I quickly in research came to the
[2:46:57.400 --> 2:47:01.840]  topic of geoengineering and and as the the gravity of this issue became apparent
[2:47:01.840 --> 2:47:05.560]  filling the sky literally feeling saturating the atmosphere with toxic
[2:47:05.560 --> 2:47:10.800]  metal particulates all the raining down on on the planet and every everything
[2:47:10.800 --> 2:47:15.400]  that lives and breath but I've had to put my life on hold my good to research
[2:47:15.400 --> 2:47:19.760]  this issue we have done non-stop for the last ten years because again I believe
[2:47:19.760 --> 2:47:23.320]  if geoengineering does not stop we will very soon have nothing to care about and
[2:47:23.320 --> 2:47:27.280]  even if it stopped today the damage they have already done the seeds that have
[2:47:27.280 --> 2:47:30.680]  already been sown in all of us with these toxic metal for particulates the
[2:47:30.680 --> 2:47:36.320]  are our lethal beyond belief and and again we will all be feeling the fall
[2:47:36.320 --> 2:47:40.200]  out of what's already happened well the website folks is geoengineeringwatch.org
[2:47:40.200 --> 2:47:44.800]  that's where you will find Dane's work and I also want to encourage you that if
[2:47:44.800 --> 2:47:48.440]  you want to continue to hear the truth on on topics like this like everything
[2:47:48.440 --> 2:47:51.800]  we've talked about today please support info wars become a member at
[2:47:51.800 --> 2:47:55.640]  prismplanet.tv you'll have access to all the archives and all the videos and
[2:47:55.640 --> 2:47:59.800]  you get 11 memberships for the price of one I think it's just under $6 a month
[2:47:59.800 --> 2:48:04.520]  or something somewhere in that range it's very affordable Dane what's what's
[2:48:04.520 --> 2:48:08.040]  next I mean people have not really woken up to this issue like they have with
[2:48:08.040 --> 2:48:12.520]  GMOs and GMOs is you know a genetic pollution risk but geoengineering risk
[2:48:12.520 --> 2:48:16.240]  seems like it's at the same sort of or maybe even a bigger threat than GMOs but
[2:48:16.240 --> 2:48:21.600]  we haven't seen the big you know the the masses rallying behind stopping geo
[2:48:21.600 --> 2:48:25.440]  engineering yet it needs to start because it virtually affects all other
[2:48:25.440 --> 2:48:30.280]  issues in relation to GMO foods we have data from these German and Norwegian
[2:48:30.280 --> 2:48:35.320]  researchers on horizontal gene mutation that's occurring in all plant life
[2:48:35.320 --> 2:48:38.440]  based on their studies right now from the absorption of these metal
[2:48:38.440 --> 2:48:42.960]  particulates so there there is nothing that is quote unquote truly organic at
[2:48:42.960 --> 2:48:46.880]  this point because of this saturation our bodies are absorbing again as I
[2:48:46.880 --> 2:48:49.840]  stated these particulates which makes us more susceptible to all the
[2:48:49.840 --> 2:48:53.800]  electromagnetic electro frequencies radio frequencies that we're all
[2:48:53.800 --> 2:48:58.360]  exposed to so again from every level from every direction the altering of the
[2:48:58.360 --> 2:49:01.400]  weather the shredding of the atmosphere the toxification of the soils
[2:49:01.400 --> 2:49:05.600]  toxification of the air we breathe the the conductivity in our bodies of these
[2:49:05.600 --> 2:49:09.880]  particulates from virtually every direction the web of life is being
[2:49:09.880 --> 2:49:15.080]  forwarded by these programs this is truly the issue that if it's not dealt
[2:49:15.080 --> 2:49:21.080]  with all these other issues will be mood points truly they I'm not that they're
[2:49:21.080 --> 2:49:24.720]  not important they are important but geoengineering is the issue that encompasses
[2:49:24.720 --> 2:49:28.360]  everything and if people truly did some research on this Mike they would
[2:49:28.360 --> 2:49:32.120]  understand the gravity of this issue and help us expose it if we could expose
[2:49:32.120 --> 2:49:35.680]  it we could have a chance of stopping at those contributing to these programs
[2:49:35.680 --> 2:49:39.920]  that are helping to carry out these programs we believe have no idea what
[2:49:39.920 --> 2:49:43.080]  they're involved with that if we do make them aware we could stop it do you
[2:49:43.080 --> 2:49:46.680]  think this may be part of you know the globalists seem to have decided that the
[2:49:46.680 --> 2:49:53.120]  era of needing humans is over they're they're trying to really in the next few
[2:49:53.120 --> 2:49:57.720]  decades destroy the human population kill the so-called useless eaters as they
[2:49:57.720 --> 2:50:02.280]  say and move to a robotics society an automated society self-replicating
[2:50:02.280 --> 2:50:07.560]  robots with only a few thousand humans possibly or maybe maybe a few million
[2:50:07.560 --> 2:50:12.000]  surviving and and then running the show and they know they only need really a
[2:50:12.000 --> 2:50:15.720]  small human population to maintain genetic viability of the human species
[2:50:15.720 --> 2:50:21.120]  is this possibly all part of that design it may be a part of that design but I
[2:50:21.120 --> 2:50:25.640]  believe based on all available data that there are factors in this equation that
[2:50:25.640 --> 2:50:30.400]  the power structure did not bargain on and one of those is the methane mass
[2:50:30.400 --> 2:50:34.720]  expulsion that's being released right now that we are on course right now for
[2:50:34.720 --> 2:50:39.200]  something called penis syndrome this is a scientific scenario the term is
[2:50:39.200 --> 2:50:44.160]  self-descriptive and again this is not about any of the Al Gore garbage
[2:50:44.160 --> 2:50:48.000]  shame I I gotta thank you for joining us we gotta we gotta let you go here go to

[2:54:31.360 --> 2:54:37.280]  do have a caller from Taiwan named Aspen so Aspen you're live on the air go
[2:54:37.280 --> 2:54:49.240]  ahead hey Mike hi there it's great to talk to you and I I've had actually a
[2:54:49.240 --> 2:54:55.960]  lot of trouble following the stream tonight I don't know why the GCN
[2:54:55.960 --> 2:55:02.040]  application doesn't work for it work very well from where I am here in Taiwan
[2:55:02.040 --> 2:55:05.840]  well yeah I could be could be banned with issues but are you seeing are you
[2:55:05.840 --> 2:55:11.920]  seeing something interesting going on over there well I've actually been on
[2:55:11.920 --> 2:55:20.720]  the phone for about two hours tonight trying to get through to to the show
[2:55:20.720 --> 2:55:29.840]  and also trying to get through to the Alex Jones store over here in in in
[2:55:29.840 --> 2:55:39.040]  Taiwan what we have is a microcosm of the Asian mindset and I've sent emails to
[2:55:39.040 --> 2:55:44.000]  Kurt Nemo I know you guys get like 15,000 or something yeah it's impossible to
[2:55:44.000 --> 2:55:50.760]  handle it all but but what you know to the point what do you see in well what
[2:55:50.760 --> 2:55:58.760]  what I have learned from being here in Asia and I am married now I have an Asian
[2:55:58.760 --> 2:56:06.160]  wife I have permanent residency here in Asia what I have learned of the culture
[2:56:06.160 --> 2:56:11.960]  here is that is completely different I mean fundamentally different from the
[2:56:11.960 --> 2:56:16.000]  Western perspective sure yeah I lived in Taiwan I know I know what you're talking
[2:56:16.000 --> 2:56:20.800]  about a very different mindset really yeah yeah what city are you in Taichung
[2:56:20.800 --> 2:56:29.160]  Taiwan Taipei Taichung Tainan or okay where are you man and so I've been I've
[2:56:29.160 --> 2:56:34.000]  been trying to exchange emails with Catherine over in the store about okay
[2:56:34.000 --> 2:56:37.760]  yeah caller I'm sorry we really want to get to the point of what's going on with
[2:56:37.760 --> 2:56:42.360]  Korea and I appreciate your call but it's not really on topic so we have
[2:56:42.360 --> 2:56:47.000]  another caller we have a caller on the line here but nope no we don't okay well
[2:56:47.000 --> 2:56:51.040]  let's say this if we had the show during the daytime in Korea we probably have
[2:56:51.040 --> 2:56:54.960]  callers from Korea but thank you all for respecting that let me just let's just go
[2:56:54.960 --> 2:57:01.240]  out with this real clear politics has a video of this Colorado Democrat Diana
[2:57:01.240 --> 2:57:05.080]  de Getty and listen to what she says about gun magazines go ahead and roll
[2:57:05.080 --> 2:57:09.440]  that I do think that we can pass those in and just very briefly to your last
[2:57:09.440 --> 2:57:15.440]  question what's the efficacy of banning these magazine clips I will tell you
[2:57:15.440 --> 2:57:21.160]  these these this is these are ammunition they're bullets so the people who have
[2:57:21.160 --> 2:57:26.000]  those now they're going to shoot them and so if you ban if you ban them in the
[2:57:26.000 --> 2:57:31.400]  future the number of these high-capacity magazines is going to decrease
[2:57:31.400 --> 2:57:35.920]  dramatically oh my god because she doesn't have been shot and there won't
[2:57:35.920 --> 2:57:41.080]  be any more available she doesn't realize magazines can be reloaded people oh
[2:57:41.080 --> 2:57:50.400]  my god she doesn't realize they can be reloaded so I brought I brought in a
[2:57:50.400 --> 2:57:53.880]  magazine to teach all the Democrats here's two things Democrats need to
[2:57:53.880 --> 2:57:59.120]  learn okay this is a 30 round mag and this is the Constitution now you may not
[2:57:59.120 --> 2:58:02.440]  be familiar with either one so let me give you a quick rundown the 30 round
[2:58:02.440 --> 2:58:07.720]  mag is reloaded from the top when the bullets run out you put new ones in it
[2:58:07.720 --> 2:58:11.880]  isn't that amazing it's these were invented detachable magazines were
[2:58:11.880 --> 2:58:15.080]  invented before the automobile so you might want to brush up on your history
[2:58:15.080 --> 2:58:20.760]  the Constitution was invented even before that in the 1700s you might want
[2:58:20.760 --> 2:58:25.560]  to review this too so there's my tips for the day for the Democrats who appear
[2:58:25.560 --> 2:58:29.040]  to be suffering from massive lobotomies but thank you for listening this is
[2:58:29.040 --> 2:58:33.760]  Mike Adams the health ranger on the Alex Jones show rebroadcast begins now and
[2:58:33.760 --> 2:58:37.960]  thank you for joining us today was a great show Alice to be back on tomorrow
[2:58:37.960 --> 2:58:52.920]  take care everybody
