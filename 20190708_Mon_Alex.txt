[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  Live from the InfoWars.com Studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:30.000 --> 00:44.000]  I'm watching the midterms, then you would think our country is Mad Max Thunderdome.
[00:44.000 --> 00:51.000]  This guy is like, they're coming from Guatemala, they're coming from Mexico.
[00:51.000 --> 00:55.000]  There's a liberal mob that's coming.
[00:55.000 --> 01:02.000]  You wanna drop? You wanna drop? Yeah!
[01:02.000 --> 01:04.000]  What's up, dude?
[01:04.000 --> 01:06.000]  What's up, dude?
[01:06.000 --> 01:09.000]  Who in the president?
[01:09.000 --> 01:11.000]  You're gonna be supporting this.
[01:11.000 --> 01:33.000]  And you would think everybody in the country is like to the bunker.
[01:42.000 --> 01:54.000]  Megamassive earthquakes are a real possibility, and in the near future, a certainty.
[01:54.000 --> 01:56.000]  World government is in crisis.
[01:56.000 --> 02:03.000]  Nation states are under assault from within and without.
[02:03.000 --> 02:09.000]  Giant pedophile rings controlling the deep state are now being exposed.
[02:09.000 --> 02:14.000]  This is one incredible time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:14.000 --> 02:22.000]  And I'm very honored to be here on this live Monday, July 8, 2019 transmission.
[02:22.000 --> 02:29.000]  Where to start?
[02:29.000 --> 02:38.000]  I was out in the heat this morning, hiking around, and I wasn't sweating.
[02:38.000 --> 02:41.000]  But as soon as I got in here and looked at all these stories,
[02:41.000 --> 02:45.000]  and I've been getting ready for the broadcast since 6 a.m. off and on,
[02:45.000 --> 02:52.000]  I started sweating, even though it's probably 69 degrees in here with all this equipment.
[02:52.000 --> 02:55.000]  It's a little bit hotter than other lights.
[02:55.000 --> 03:00.000]  And that's because when you read about them keeping babies alive and selling their organs,
[03:00.000 --> 03:06.000]  that's back in the news, and it's being normalized, you're supposed to start sweating.
[03:06.000 --> 03:12.000]  That's your body, metabolic system, saying we're all under threat.
[03:12.000 --> 03:14.000]  You ever been in a slaughterhouse?
[03:14.000 --> 03:16.000]  Have you ever seen footage of one?
[03:16.000 --> 03:22.000]  The cows start freaking out, yelling, mooing as the other ones get sent down the chute.
[03:22.000 --> 03:28.000]  They get hit in the head by a big air pump jack hammer in the head.
[03:28.000 --> 03:30.000]  And then big chains haul them up by their hind legs.
[03:30.000 --> 03:34.000]  They get their throat slit by a big machine.
[03:34.000 --> 03:37.000]  The other cows start freaking out trying to get out of there.
[03:37.000 --> 03:42.000]  Well, I'm sitting here watching a giant world government kill grid being built,
[03:42.000 --> 03:47.000]  and the globalists using weaponized scientific mind control to turn a large part of the population
[03:47.000 --> 03:52.000]  into basically undead, foaming at the mouth anti-human zombies
[03:52.000 --> 03:55.000]  who walk around talking about killing children all day.
[03:55.000 --> 04:02.000]  We're in a science fiction movie, and I'm sweating, sweating.
[04:02.000 --> 04:06.000]  I guess it's like a mini anxiety attack I have now.
[04:06.000 --> 04:11.000]  Every time I get in here, you're ready to go on air because my brain, my metabolic system,
[04:11.000 --> 04:15.000]  my central nervous system is like, you better get this right, buddy,
[04:15.000 --> 04:17.000]  because I'm facing reality.
[04:17.000 --> 04:22.000]  I'm living in the real world.
[04:22.000 --> 04:27.000]  I was sitting out with Robert Barnes when he was here in town in 98 degree heat
[04:27.000 --> 04:32.000]  one afternoon at the shooting range, they have an outdoor smoking for cigar lounge.
[04:32.000 --> 04:37.000]  You're like, look, you're not sweating, Alex, in 98 degree heat, but I'm sweating in here.
[04:37.000 --> 04:43.000]  You know why? We're in the cockpit, and the energy from all of the planets flowing through and out.
[04:43.000 --> 04:50.000]  And we are at the center of the resistance for humanity to survive a pro-human future.
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.000]  Crap yourselves in on back in 60 seconds.
[04:52.000 --> 04:54.000]  This is going to be one of the record books.
[04:54.000 --> 04:57.000]  Until you hear what's coming up, stay with us.
[05:24.000 --> 05:28.000]  This is your day to day life with heat while encouraging hormonal balance.
[05:28.000 --> 05:33.000]  Perfect by itself or with super male vitality in the true alpha male pack.
[05:33.000 --> 05:38.000]  Alpha power can help lose performance, help maintain normal testosterone levels,
[05:38.000 --> 05:40.000]  support healthy cholesterol and more.
[05:40.000 --> 05:44.000]  Let alpha power help bring you to the peak of your optimal health.
[05:44.000 --> 05:47.000]  Don't fall short on energy in the fight against tyranny.
[05:47.000 --> 05:51.000]  Show the world what a true alpha male looks like today with alpha power.
[05:51.000 --> 05:54.000]  Head to infowarstore.com today.
[06:03.000 --> 06:05.000]  Waging war on corruption.
[06:05.000 --> 06:28.000]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[06:28.000 --> 06:37.000]  Tommy Robinson called me last week and we had a private discussion.
[06:37.000 --> 06:39.000]  Came on the air Friday.
[06:39.000 --> 06:46.000]  I hosted the war room with the Owen Schreuer and we had Tommy on for an hour.
[06:46.000 --> 06:49.000]  And he's going to be making a major announcement.
[06:49.000 --> 06:52.000]  The freedom fighter over in the U.K.
[06:52.000 --> 06:58.000]  Has been imprisoned three times for the solitary confinement, lost 40 pounds.
[06:58.000 --> 07:00.000]  Been tortured.
[07:00.000 --> 07:05.000]  Islamists have thrown bleach on his face in the prison.
[07:05.000 --> 07:07.000]  And he's marked for death.
[07:07.000 --> 07:09.000]  I've told him next time they're going to kill him.
[07:09.000 --> 07:17.000]  He's been ordered to show up in court next Thursday and they're told he's going to be put in solitary confinement for up to a year.
[07:17.000 --> 07:30.000]  The crime he exposed giant child kidnapping sex rings with children being killed and then chopped up into kebab meat and fed to people on the streets of London and other cities.
[07:30.000 --> 07:32.000]  It's now mainstream news.
[07:32.000 --> 07:36.000]  And the British government is so evil and so pedophile filled.
[07:36.000 --> 07:39.000]  It was the Muslims were supplying them children.
[07:39.000 --> 07:42.000]  And now thousands of these Muslims have been convicted and imprisoned.
[07:42.000 --> 07:44.000]  They're usually only given a few months.
[07:44.000 --> 07:51.000]  And the government covers up the the the big Islamic joke is to sell you human meat.
[07:51.000 --> 07:53.000]  That's an al-Qaeda ISIS thing.
[07:53.000 --> 08:03.000]  You famously seen the footage in Libya where they would make people eat human meat from from prisoners they killed before they killed them because they believe it sends them to hell.
[08:03.000 --> 08:08.000]  And so he caught them selling the kebab meat of the dead girls.
[08:08.000 --> 08:14.000]  Oh, yeah, they hang them up in the back after they've, you know, raped them or whatever.
[08:14.000 --> 08:21.000]  And hundreds of men have sex with them and the police it turned out in these cities will do nothing to help them because it's politically incorrect to do that.
[08:21.000 --> 08:24.000]  So yeah, this sounds completely horrible.
[08:24.000 --> 08:26.000]  It sounds completely evil.
[08:26.000 --> 08:31.000]  It sounds like it's not real.
[08:31.000 --> 08:37.000]  But it is real hundreds of knife attacks a day, dozens of deaths a week.
[08:37.000 --> 08:56.000]  Mass raping mass killing because of the wonders of multiculturalism bringing in barbarous primitive folks from vicious countries that are ruled by kingpins and by warlords and then bringing them into a docile conditioned,
[08:56.000 --> 09:07.000]  imperially trained group of people who were once wild themselves of it now been conditioned to submit and it creates a nightmare situation.
[09:07.000 --> 09:12.000]  And so that's where all of this is going.
[09:12.000 --> 09:17.000]  Top liberals all over Europe are now coming out and saying we were wrong.
[09:17.000 --> 09:19.000]  The multiculturalism didn't work.
[09:19.000 --> 09:21.000]  We're reversing it right now.
[09:21.000 --> 09:28.000]  And doing that, they admit to stop a rebellion by the nation states and to stop themselves being thrown out of power.
[09:28.000 --> 09:30.000]  They're still going to keep the borders open.
[09:30.000 --> 09:34.000]  This is part of a larger plan that's all delineated.
[09:34.000 --> 09:44.000]  Now, Tommy Robinson is going to be making a major announcement and appeal to the president of the United States.
[09:44.000 --> 09:45.000]  This is going to be big news.
[09:45.000 --> 09:46.000]  It's very important.
[09:46.000 --> 09:48.000]  It's also very illustrative of things.
[09:48.000 --> 09:50.000]  Just wait till we get there.
[09:50.000 --> 09:53.000]  He's going to be more today.
[09:53.000 --> 09:59.000]  But he's only three days away, three and a half days away from being taken.
[09:59.000 --> 10:06.000]  And being put back into an Islamic torture pit where the jail guards allow them to come to his solitary confinement cell,
[10:06.000 --> 10:11.000]  hang their butts into the opening and defecate into his cell.
[10:11.000 --> 10:17.000]  And then up to a dozen, they come by, they lift their dresses up, Islamic dresses they wear,
[10:17.000 --> 10:20.000]  they lift their butt up to the thing and then they defecate into a cell.
[10:20.000 --> 10:21.000]  The old guards love it.
[10:21.000 --> 10:31.000]  The government loves it because he dared expose the pedophile meat wagon going right into their mouths of our children.
[10:31.000 --> 10:35.000]  Again, the Muslims are the Renfields in the UK.
[10:35.000 --> 10:42.000]  And any pedophilia going on in Islam, which is rampant, you know, Mohammed, Mary's nine-year-old niece or whatever,
[10:42.000 --> 10:49.000]  is nothing compared to the people running the UK. That is pedophile-central, ladies and gentlemen.
[10:49.000 --> 10:59.000]  Speaking of pedophile-central, here's the indictment of Mr. Epstein,
[10:59.000 --> 11:04.000]  who was a procureer for Robert Mueller and others of Blackmail.
[11:04.000 --> 11:12.000]  He ran up to 200 girls at a time, ages ranging from 17 down to 10 that we know of.
[11:12.000 --> 11:18.000]  And it was up to these girls to go out and find disadvantaged girls, poor girls, poor families.
[11:18.000 --> 11:26.000]  And then Epstein would give them sometimes up to $10,000 a week back to the families to rent their daughters.
[11:26.000 --> 11:34.000]  And then he would have rich men on board aircraft having sex with the children and then also flying to other facilities.
[11:34.000 --> 11:42.000]  Some of the children never showed back up, of course, because there's always a little something extra at the bottom of the rat hole, isn't there?
[11:42.000 --> 11:53.000]  And so now the media, the evil globalist disinformation factory, has come out and said,
[11:53.000 --> 11:59.000]  Donald Trump is in trouble. This will hurt Donald Trump. And then they have no evidence, no statements, no nothing.
[11:59.000 --> 12:03.000]  And Donald Trump's not in the indictment. And no mention of Donald Trump.
[12:03.000 --> 12:16.000]  Donald Trump is now being reported in major newspapers, is the only person when Epstein originally got busted in 2009
[12:16.000 --> 12:26.000]  to work with the lawyers for the victims. And the lawyer said he was wonderful and gave them all this info.
[12:26.000 --> 12:39.000]  And so much time as you need and spent hours and hours over multiple days helping try to put Epstein under the jail.
[12:39.000 --> 12:47.000]  Because he knew him from business. They didn't fly on planes together, none of that. Trump's been to one party Epstein was at.
[12:47.000 --> 12:53.000]  And he told Roger Stone, said, I pull up and you're like, isn't it nice? You let all the neighborhood kids swim here.
[12:53.000 --> 13:01.000]  And they looked around and he ran out of the house.
[13:01.000 --> 13:06.000]  Trump's the guy on his Twitter saying, execute pedophiles. I agree with him.
[13:06.000 --> 13:14.000]  So what happens when you're in the Billionaires Club and you don't play along?
[13:14.000 --> 13:20.000]  Well, why did all this happen? The media thinks you're stupid. We're in this next segment.
[13:20.000 --> 13:25.000]  Because the media two years ago tried to blame Trump in time to this.
[13:25.000 --> 13:28.000]  And then they tried to blame Alan Dershowitz who had no connection to this.
[13:28.000 --> 13:39.000]  And Alan Dershowitz got pissed and sued and got hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of pages of the FBI didn't want released back from the Obama days and from the court case.
[13:39.000 --> 13:43.000]  And it's the flight manifestos and it's the background and it's all of it.
[13:43.000 --> 13:51.000]  Now, the indictment is designed at a limited level to contain this information.
[13:51.000 --> 13:58.000]  And you've got one of the prosecutors involved is Comey's daughter. So they've got their deep state people in there trying to contain this.
[13:58.000 --> 14:03.000]  But the judge did the right thing, ordered it released.
[14:03.000 --> 14:14.000]  And it's incredible information because you're not supposed to in a flight manifest only put the initials of people on board the plane.
[14:14.000 --> 14:18.000]  You're supposed to put their full names, their driver's license number or social security number.
[14:18.000 --> 14:25.000]  And you have to call ahead on each one and it's cleared for takeoff by Homeland Security since 9 11.
[14:25.000 --> 14:29.000]  That was in place a week after 9 11 18 years ago.
[14:29.000 --> 14:35.000]  This is Clinton 20 plus times on the manifest reportedly hundreds of times.
[14:35.000 --> 14:47.000]  He wasn't flying to Europe to the Middle East to known pedophiles facilities where these Islamists have whole harems of little kids.
[14:47.000 --> 14:54.000]  So these people are the worst demons that anyone could imagine.
[14:54.000 --> 15:05.000]  And yes, they even had a temple for having sex with the children on this Lolita Express Island.
[15:05.000 --> 15:12.000]  So you need to understand these are these are psychic vampires who are draining the energy off people.
[15:12.000 --> 15:20.000]  And that's what they do on board these passenger sized jets, large jets.
[15:20.000 --> 15:28.000]  And then the media always white washes it and shows you a girl started when she was 15 but now she's 18.
[15:28.000 --> 15:31.000]  It's far worse than all of that.
[15:31.000 --> 15:32.000]  Okay.
[15:32.000 --> 15:37.000]  And this means Trump's taking the gloves off and they are really, really scared.
[15:37.000 --> 15:38.000]  This is a big deal.
[15:38.000 --> 15:46.000]  Also, Carpe Dongtum who made a little surprise visit to the White House at a 20 minute conversation with the president.
[15:46.000 --> 15:57.000]  He's going to be joining us in the third hour with a lot of interesting information and a first look at this big summit coming up in DC on Thursday.
[15:57.000 --> 16:09.000]  Stay with us.
[16:27.000 --> 16:29.000]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[16:58.000 --> 17:01.000]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners.
[17:01.000 --> 17:10.000]  If you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system but we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[17:10.000 --> 17:11.000]  Bill Hyde here.
[17:11.000 --> 17:19.000]  I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[17:19.000 --> 17:24.000]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[17:24.000 --> 17:36.000]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the flood water's back story.
[17:36.000 --> 17:38.000]  So here's what you should do right now.
[17:38.000 --> 17:42.000]  Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com.
[17:42.000 --> 17:44.000]  That's myownpowergrid.com.
[17:44.000 --> 17:48.000]  Over $1,000 in great off the grid gear and a ton of bonuses too.
[17:48.000 --> 17:55.000]  In the best part, you're not going to pay $750 or $500 or even $200. Go to myownpowergrid.com to learn more.
[17:55.000 --> 18:00.000]  That's myownpowergrid.com.
[18:00.000 --> 18:03.000]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York. Marcus, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[18:03.000 --> 18:06.000]  Hey, Alex. Yeah, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air.
[18:06.000 --> 18:12.000]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[18:12.000 --> 18:22.000]  I think that the Neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public approaching 2020.
[18:22.000 --> 18:28.000]  That's it. I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency. It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[18:28.000 --> 18:29.000]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[18:29.000 --> 18:35.000]  I agree entirely. And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[18:35.000 --> 18:40.000]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old. I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[18:40.000 --> 18:45.000]  But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war. You've won a lot of battles.
[18:45.000 --> 18:49.000]  And there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[18:49.000 --> 18:51.000]  We're going to keep fighting in the input war.
[18:51.000 --> 18:58.000]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[18:58.000 --> 19:01.000]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[19:01.000 --> 19:07.000]  I talk about this on the air and I know it sinks into people, but I've decided that we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements.
[19:07.000 --> 19:12.000]  In that if you go back five, six years ago before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it,
[19:12.000 --> 19:15.000]  I would talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were.
[19:15.000 --> 19:18.000]  And I'd have doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good.
[19:18.000 --> 19:21.000]  And instead, the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us.
[19:21.000 --> 19:22.000]  Or they'll shut us down.
[19:22.000 --> 19:26.000]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful they were.
[19:26.000 --> 19:27.000]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[19:27.000 --> 19:39.000]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements. No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[19:39.000 --> 19:42.000]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them.
[19:42.000 --> 19:47.000]  And all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things.
[19:47.000 --> 19:48.000]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[19:48.000 --> 19:54.000]  They have side effects, not with Mother Nature, but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest.
[19:54.000 --> 20:02.000]  infoorstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[20:02.000 --> 20:26.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:26.000 --> 20:28.000]  Bill Clinton.
[20:28.000 --> 20:35.000]  Nice guy. Got a lot of problems coming up in my opinion with the famous island with Jeffrey Epstein.
[20:35.000 --> 20:37.000]  A lot of problems.
[20:37.000 --> 20:59.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have evidence of massive crimes.
[20:59.000 --> 21:23.000]  Rare coins, jewels are the underground economy currency. But now even Senate reports confirm in many areas of the world, human trafficking, including sex trafficking of small children who are killed in snuff films, their organs harvested after their heads are blown off with 357 magnums.
[21:23.000 --> 21:25.000]  This is in the law enforcement reports.
[21:25.000 --> 21:30.000]  This is the stuff the FBI has to look at the real stuff on the dark web.
[21:30.000 --> 21:34.000]  Toddlers being gang raped by men and having their heads blown off.
[21:34.000 --> 21:38.000]  Remember that's who wants to run your life.
[21:38.000 --> 21:44.000]  Sorry to have to talk like that, but this isn't just a bunch of old rich men having sex with 15 year old girls.
[21:44.000 --> 21:45.000]  That's bad enough.
[21:45.000 --> 21:50.000]  This is blowing children's brains out.
[21:50.000 --> 21:52.000]  You understand?
[21:52.000 --> 22:02.000]  Like really? Yeah, notice they had playing with dead babies, throwing dead babies around like footballs, talking about how they love Satanism, eating the babies.
[22:02.000 --> 22:08.000]  These are things that abortionists have been convicted of doing because their own employees go public.
[22:08.000 --> 22:19.000]  Having sex with the dead bodies sometimes for weeks, killing children, putting them in refrigerator trucks and delivering them to people to have sex with the dead bodies.
[22:19.000 --> 22:23.000]  I'm telling you some of the stuff that was confirmed with Jimmy Savelle.
[22:23.000 --> 22:24.000]  I'm sorry.
[22:24.000 --> 22:25.000]  This is so horrible.
[22:25.000 --> 22:28.000]  It's real.
[22:28.000 --> 22:39.000]  And this is what Hollywood is purely demonic, purely evil, a black hole to another dimension to hell is open on our West Coast.
[22:39.000 --> 22:49.000]  It's open in London, England is open in Paris, France.
[22:49.000 --> 22:53.000]  Gates to hell.
[22:53.000 --> 23:05.000]  And I have stacks of news confirming fusion GPS, the fake Russia gate dossier tried to link Trump to Jeffrey Epstein.
[23:05.000 --> 23:09.000]  But he had no connections like the Clintons and everybody else.
[23:09.000 --> 23:17.000]  And so now the corporate media adds to all this evil by lying and saying, ooh, Trump's in trouble.
[23:17.000 --> 23:21.000]  Trump's going to be connected to it.
[23:21.000 --> 23:24.000]  Think about that.
[23:24.000 --> 23:25.000]  Think about that.
[23:25.000 --> 23:29.000]  They're now openly defending the pedophile rings.
[23:29.000 --> 23:31.000]  But they've always been doing it.
[23:31.000 --> 23:34.000]  Remember I said Trump was going to bust the pedophile rings wide open?
[23:34.000 --> 23:46.000]  And notice you've seen a multi-thousand percent increase, a 10-fold increase in arrest, prosecution, and conviction of pedophiles.
[23:46.000 --> 23:52.000]  And because he was at parties with Epstein and in some business deals with him, Trump busts thousands of those a year.
[23:52.000 --> 23:57.000]  Oh, he's with Epstein.
[23:57.000 --> 24:04.000]  Meanwhile, we have the aircraft manifest of Bill Clinton flying with little children, little girls, and the initials.
[24:04.000 --> 24:11.000]  When the Secret Service made an issue about it, what did Bill Clinton do?
[24:11.000 --> 24:16.000]  He stopped carrying the Secret Service with him when he went on those aircraft with those children.
[24:16.000 --> 24:18.000]  That's what Don Bongino talked about a few years ago.
[24:18.000 --> 24:20.000]  He said, watch out, Hillary.
[24:20.000 --> 24:22.000]  Don't run your mouth.
[24:22.000 --> 24:25.000]  We all know who's really with Epstein and the little kids.
[24:25.000 --> 24:28.000]  Don't poke the bear.
[24:28.000 --> 24:30.000]  Well, the bear got poked.
[24:30.000 --> 24:36.000]  And here's a OAN Jack Passovic report on the latest information here it is.
[24:36.000 --> 24:47.000]  Former President Bill Clinton is keeping silent on his close relationship to a convicted sex offender as renewed attention is pinned on his long history of sexual misconduct allegations.
[24:47.000 --> 24:56.000]  The Clinton Presidential Library refused to respond to a request submitted last week, seeking information on Clinton's close ties with billionaire Jeffrey Epstein.
[24:56.000 --> 25:00.000]  Do you soundly swear to testimony about to give away the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth to help you get?
[25:00.000 --> 25:01.000]  Yes, I do.
[25:01.000 --> 25:10.000]  Epstein was convicted for solicitating sex from underage girls as young as 14 back in 2008, to which he served a short 13-month prison sentence.
[25:10.000 --> 25:20.000]  According to reports, Epstein used his private jet, dubbed as the Lolita Express, to fly his friends around where they were offered sex with underage girls.
[25:20.000 --> 25:30.000]  The Boeing 727 jet was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had grouped sex on during the flights, which was verified by an air hostess back in 2015.
[25:30.000 --> 25:34.000]  Did you ever think that maybe more was going on than simple massages?
[25:34.000 --> 25:36.000]  Looking back, of course.
[25:36.000 --> 25:38.000]  Was there a bed on the airplane?
[25:38.000 --> 25:39.000]  Actually, yes, there was.
[25:39.000 --> 25:48.000]  According to flight records, Bill Clinton traveled with Epstein on board the Lolita Express, a total of 26 times from 2001 to 2003.
[25:48.000 --> 25:58.000]  Flight logs indicate only the first names of the female passengers were listed on the flights Clinton took, and show he ditched his secret service detail on five of the trips.
[25:58.000 --> 26:04.000]  On one of the flights, Clinton was joined by actor Kevin Spacey, who is now accused of sexual misconduct with an underage boy.
[26:04.000 --> 26:15.000]  Epstein's assistant Sarah Kellan was accused in court filings of recruiting and grooming underage girls to perform sex acts with the billionaire and his friends, and sometimes participated in the alleged acts.
[26:15.000 --> 26:19.000]  She traveled with Clinton on as many as 11 of the flights that he took.
[26:19.000 --> 26:33.000]  According to reports, Epstein would also fly his friends to his private 72-acre island in the Virgin Islands, where a team of human traffickers allegedly rounded up girls as young as 12 to service Epstein and his friends during their visit.
[26:33.000 --> 26:36.000]  It is unclear if Clinton ever visited the island.
[26:36.000 --> 26:46.000]  In 2015, Judicial Watch submitted a request to the Department of Homeland Security to obtain records of secret service expenses used by Clinton during his trips with Epstein.
[26:46.000 --> 26:51.000]  According to the Watchdog group, the department never handed over the record.
[26:51.000 --> 26:53.000]  So there you go, Jack.
[26:53.000 --> 26:54.000]  What's up?
[26:54.000 --> 26:55.000]  I tweeted that out.
[26:55.000 --> 26:57.000]  That's from the One American News Network doing a great job.
[26:57.000 --> 27:04.000]  I think you're going to be seeing the president promote more and more now that Fox is sliding, like I did last election, towards the left.
[27:04.000 --> 27:05.000]  Wow.
[27:05.000 --> 27:07.000]  What a time to be alive.
[27:07.000 --> 27:09.000]  We're going to get more into this when we come back.
[27:09.000 --> 27:20.000]  I'm going to go through the documents, through the history, and the fact that you can't take a step if you're around the Clintons and not run into a convicted child trafficker or child rapist.
[27:20.000 --> 27:27.000]  Again, one of the deputy heads of her foundation got caught smuggling kids in and a bunch of them disappeared and were found dead.
[27:27.000 --> 27:32.000]  She changed her name and works for the group that gives the data to Amber Alert.
[27:32.000 --> 27:35.000]  They want to keep tabs on the children, don't they?
[27:35.000 --> 27:40.000]  So you have to understand, this is their currency.
[27:40.000 --> 27:44.000]  There's over $4 billion a year of the Senate reports as of 2018.
[27:44.000 --> 27:46.000]  The numbers are always a year old.
[27:46.000 --> 27:52.000]  $4 billion a year paid to the drug cartels just to smuggle people across the border.
[27:52.000 --> 27:58.000]  Many of them children, one-third of those not with a genetic relative.
[27:58.000 --> 28:00.000]  They're kidnapped.
[28:00.000 --> 28:03.000]  But the left says we're putting them in cages.
[28:03.000 --> 28:04.000]  We're torturing them.
[28:04.000 --> 28:05.000]  We're the Nazis.
[28:05.000 --> 28:08.000]  And the truth is they want that fresh meat.
[28:08.000 --> 28:10.000]  They want that fresh blood.
[28:10.000 --> 28:15.000]  They want unidentified children so they can snuff film them, torture them and drink their blood.
[28:15.000 --> 28:17.000]  Now watch, it's all coming out.
[28:17.000 --> 28:18.000]  You're going to see it.
[28:18.000 --> 28:20.000]  They drain children's blood.
[28:20.000 --> 28:22.000]  They drink children's blood.
[28:22.000 --> 28:24.000]  They kill babies after they're born.
[28:24.000 --> 28:26.000]  They keep them alive.
[28:26.000 --> 28:30.000]  I was talking to an RN nurse just a month ago in my kitchen.
[28:30.000 --> 28:32.000]  And she goes, yeah, how do you know about that?
[28:32.000 --> 28:40.000]  We keep, yeah, she goes, I don't work in that area, but there's a special wing where they keep the babies alive and organ donors so they can get the organs.
[28:40.000 --> 28:42.000]  Yeah, keep them alive, right?
[28:42.000 --> 28:43.000]  Why?
[28:43.000 --> 28:48.000]  Well, because we get more money that way, being able to, you know, have it on the market.
[28:48.000 --> 28:50.000]  I'm like, yeah, just try to shake it.
[28:50.000 --> 28:56.000]  I never even thought, murdering babies, murder, Satanism, breaking blood, blowing their heads off.
[28:56.000 --> 29:22.000]  Got it.
[29:22.000 --> 29:27.000]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[29:27.000 --> 29:31.000]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[29:31.000 --> 29:33.000]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[29:33.000 --> 29:41.000]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[29:41.000 --> 29:52.000]  Order your two months supply today by calling 866-295-5305 or order online hbextract.com.

[30:12.000 --> 30:40.000]  Heart and Body Extract 866-295-5305 or hbextract.com.
[30:40.000 --> 30:44.000]  Without you, I'm going to be destroyed and it's not going to be fun, but that's not what's important.
[30:44.000 --> 30:46.000]  The enemy could win.
[30:46.000 --> 30:48.000]  We're a key chess piece in this fight.
[30:48.000 --> 30:49.000]  We're being used by God.
[30:49.000 --> 30:50.000]  You're being used by God.
[30:50.000 --> 30:51.000]  This is Providence.
[30:51.000 --> 30:55.000]  So I salute you and I thank you for all you've done from the bottom of my heart.
[30:55.000 --> 31:00.000]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[31:00.000 --> 31:04.000]  The globalists are hyper competitive, scientific dictators.
[31:04.000 --> 31:05.000]  They are technocrats.
[31:05.000 --> 31:08.000]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[31:08.000 --> 31:12.000]  They believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets to the
[31:12.000 --> 31:15.000]  way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[31:15.000 --> 31:17.000]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[31:17.000 --> 31:19.000]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[31:19.000 --> 31:24.000]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of
[31:24.000 --> 31:26.000]  control in our lives is our bodies.
[31:26.000 --> 31:31.000]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from ForrestLife.com, I couldn't do it.
[31:31.000 --> 31:36.000]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality
[31:36.000 --> 31:41.000]  metacobolamine and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[31:41.000 --> 31:46.000]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over the counter that you're going
[31:46.000 --> 31:47.000]  to find anywhere.
[31:47.000 --> 31:48.000]  It is amazing.
[31:48.000 --> 31:53.000]  Experience pure metacobolamine B12 for yourself and fund the second American evolution against
[31:53.000 --> 32:00.000]  the tyrants at InfowarsStore.com, InfowarsLife.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[32:00.000 --> 32:04.000]  Briefly folks, please do not forget, this is the Maximum Alert.
[32:04.000 --> 32:05.000]  We wouldn't be here without you.
[32:05.000 --> 32:06.000]  Thank you for your support and your help.
[32:06.000 --> 32:08.000]  We're going to be steadfast in this fight.
[32:08.000 --> 32:11.000]  We need financial support and we're going to put up more prominent donate buttons at

[32:15.000 --> 32:16.000]  We want to mail us a check.
[32:16.000 --> 32:18.000]  We will put it into the fight against these globalists.
[32:18.000 --> 32:22.000]  We need money to fight back and to let them know we're taking action and to defend ourselves.

[32:56.000 --> 32:59.000]  We're getting a lot of support right now, but we need a lot to go into this dark night.
[32:59.000 --> 33:00.000]  We're not going to back down.
[33:00.000 --> 33:07.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:07.000 --> 33:22.000]  Waging War on Corruption.
[33:22.000 --> 33:32.000]  Alex Jones.
[33:32.000 --> 33:59.000]  I want everybody to understand something if he's just too dead earlier.
[33:59.000 --> 34:03.000]  You heard me talk about what they do to children.
[34:03.000 --> 34:09.000]  I've been on air 25 years, and I have read hundreds of thousands of articles.
[34:09.000 --> 34:15.000]  And I have read news out of Europe, out of Russia, and out of the US.
[34:15.000 --> 34:21.000]  And it's normally in law enforcement publications, but it deals with evidence that comes out of
[34:21.000 --> 34:22.000]  trials.
[34:22.000 --> 34:26.000]  And most of this never gets put on the news because the left wants to cover up.
[34:26.000 --> 34:33.000]  Religion is aborting babies, killing babies, damaging children, having sex with children,
[34:33.000 --> 34:37.000]  brainwashing children, poisoning children.
[34:37.000 --> 34:43.000]  And when I was telling you about some of the stuff I said, that's in FBI reports.
[34:43.000 --> 34:47.000]  That's in convicted criminals and killers cases.
[34:47.000 --> 34:52.000]  I mean, I could go on for hours describing the stuff they do to children.
[34:52.000 --> 34:56.000]  And it's gotten to the point where when I see the articles most of the time, I can't
[34:56.000 --> 34:57.000]  even make myself read it.
[34:57.000 --> 35:00.000]  So it's not like I'm up here exaggerating this.
[35:00.000 --> 35:04.000]  The truth is, I know why people can't deal with this.
[35:04.000 --> 35:10.000]  It's because it's frightening that there are the equivalent of real vampires.
[35:10.000 --> 35:11.000]  This isn't Salem's law.
[35:11.000 --> 35:13.000]  This isn't Count Dracula.
[35:13.000 --> 35:22.000]  This is psychotic, demon-possessed people roaming the earth, supplying children to people even
[35:22.000 --> 35:24.000]  more evil.
[35:24.000 --> 35:26.000]  And they harvest their organs.
[35:26.000 --> 35:34.000]  The more they can defile a child, the better, the more satanic energy they get.
[35:34.000 --> 35:38.000]  So it's high enough that they just torture them and make them beg for mommy.
[35:38.000 --> 35:41.000]  Then they bleed them out.
[35:41.000 --> 35:43.000]  Then they drink their blood.
[35:43.000 --> 35:50.000]  In other cases, 20 men rape two-year-old boys and girls while they scream for mommy.
[35:50.000 --> 35:53.000]  Then they take a 357 and blow their heads off.
[35:53.000 --> 35:58.000]  That's what goes on in Italy and snuff made in Russia.
[35:58.000 --> 36:10.000]  And do you know who the number one connoisseurs and people that are consuming this?
[36:10.000 --> 36:12.000]  Do you know what that is?
[36:12.000 --> 36:18.000]  It's Los Angeles and San Francisco and Seattle.
[36:18.000 --> 36:29.000]  In the cases where they only make, say, 100 VHS videotapes or they put it on 8mm.
[36:29.000 --> 36:37.000]  And these people have snuff viewing parties where they then recruit people in that actually want to be part of it.
[36:37.000 --> 36:41.000]  All this stuff is like gateway drugs.
[36:41.000 --> 36:48.000]  Now we need to play that Tom DeLay 12 perversions piece that got him thrown in prison.
[36:48.000 --> 36:53.000]  They tried to throw him in prisons, took all the money he had to get put in jail for a while.
[36:53.000 --> 36:55.000]  Remember that?
[36:55.000 --> 36:57.000]  Publican leader that was exposing the pedophile rings?
[36:57.000 --> 36:59.000]  Throw his ass in jail.
[36:59.000 --> 37:01.000]  But see, they're not on top anymore.
[37:01.000 --> 37:03.000]  They're this close to going down.
[37:03.000 --> 37:06.000]  And we have to be ready to admit what they've done.
[37:06.000 --> 37:11.000]  Now, the Nexium trial.
[37:11.000 --> 37:13.000]  We put that back on screen.
[37:13.000 --> 37:17.000]  What came out in the trial that they watched snuff films?
[37:17.000 --> 37:22.000]  And what were the snuff films of?
[37:22.000 --> 37:25.000]  What were the snuff films of?
[37:25.000 --> 37:28.000]  You guessed it.
[37:28.000 --> 37:31.000]  You guessed it.
[37:31.000 --> 37:37.000]  You see, liberal satanic women, they like to see pretty women killed.
[37:37.000 --> 37:40.000]  And they like to see little boys killed.
[37:40.000 --> 37:45.000]  That's why the average leftist mother puts their child on Prozac, Ridlin.
[37:45.000 --> 37:47.000]  They end up trying to institutionalize their boys.
[37:47.000 --> 37:49.000]  It's a satanic demon.
[37:49.000 --> 37:51.000]  That moon child's in by proxy.
[37:51.000 --> 37:53.000]  A lot of things wants to hurt that little boy.
[37:53.000 --> 37:57.000]  And the woman, they don't even know that she's demon possessed.
[37:57.000 --> 38:02.000]  But these women, you see their sons, they look like their souls have been sucked.
[38:02.000 --> 38:08.000]  It's like all the, quote, lesbians that adopt children or steal them from their ex-husband
[38:08.000 --> 38:10.000]  and then chop their genitals off.
[38:10.000 --> 38:11.000]  That's a trend.
[38:11.000 --> 38:16.000]  That's not just in the case that was in Brazil last week.
[38:16.000 --> 38:22.000]  You see, defiling little girls and defiling little boys
[38:22.000 --> 38:27.000]  and hurting them is an affront to God.
[38:27.000 --> 38:32.000]  And it's the ultimate sin, the thing God hates more than anything.
[38:32.000 --> 38:36.000]  And so if you're going to serve Satan, you might as well go all the way, right?
[38:36.000 --> 38:40.000]  So all of you leftists listening, you wonder why you have empty, cursed lives.
[38:40.000 --> 38:41.000]  You come from cursed bloodlines.
[38:41.000 --> 38:43.000]  You come from weak people.
[38:43.000 --> 38:47.000]  And you think if you get rid of the good, you'll suddenly be on top.
[38:47.000 --> 38:51.000]  No, you'll just be even more in the dark.
[38:51.000 --> 39:00.000]  And now they're showing Tony Podesta stuff that, again, it's high magic to them.
[39:00.000 --> 39:02.000]  They're all in the occult.
[39:02.000 --> 39:11.000]  When Tony Podesta in 2007 had a full cover page in the local Washington Post about his
[39:11.000 --> 39:16.000]  deviant art and his dungeon basement, and now he's proud of this giant collection of
[39:16.000 --> 39:27.000]  pedophile artwork depicting children chained up in dungeons, bleeding out of their orifices.
[39:27.000 --> 39:30.000]  You say, well, why would they put in the Washington Post?
[39:30.000 --> 39:32.000]  Why would they have Desmond as amazing doing all this?
[39:32.000 --> 39:35.000]  Why would they have major articles saying, pedophilia is good.
[39:35.000 --> 39:38.000]  They're normalizing it.
[39:38.000 --> 39:44.000]  They're getting you ready so that when it really comes out, when they get caught, it's like, oh,
[39:44.000 --> 39:48.000]  3,000 priests in Pennsylvania alone rape children.
[39:48.000 --> 39:51.000]  Oh, what's in the actual conviction reports?
[39:51.000 --> 39:54.000]  What's in the actual indictments?
[39:54.000 --> 39:59.000]  Hundreds of priests detailing, well, we did satanic rituals.
[39:59.000 --> 40:04.000]  We'd take the little six, seven, eight-year-old, 10-year-old boys, and we would do a satanic
[40:04.000 --> 40:06.000]  ritual where 20 of us had sex with them.
[40:06.000 --> 40:14.000]  And they would say, you now take the blood of Christ, and they would pump HIV into them.
[40:14.000 --> 40:19.000]  You have to understand that on the altar in the Catholic churches.
[40:19.000 --> 40:22.000]  And then it's just a little blurb, oh, here's the indictments.
[40:22.000 --> 40:23.000]  Here's the witnesses.
[40:23.000 --> 40:24.000]  Here's the conviction.
[40:24.000 --> 40:26.000]  Here's the state police report.
[40:26.000 --> 40:27.000]  Here's the FBI report.
[40:27.000 --> 40:34.000]  And it's just so horrible that they go, well, we can't arrest 3,000 priests.
[40:34.000 --> 40:37.000]  And it's beyond anything you've ever heard of in a movie.
[40:37.000 --> 40:39.000]  And it's just kind of a blurb, just a little blip.
[40:39.000 --> 40:44.000]  Oh, they have satanic rituals every Saturday night, every Friday night down at the Catholic
[40:44.000 --> 40:45.000]  church.
[40:45.000 --> 40:48.000]  All the little old ladies come in during the week, think they're doing good stuff.
[40:48.000 --> 40:52.000]  Meanwhile, it's not Catholics doing it, it's Satanists that took the church over.
[40:52.000 --> 40:57.000]  And not all churches are doing this, but I'd say Satan targets churches.
[40:57.000 --> 41:04.000]  I'd say half the churches, whether they're Catholic or Protestant, are chaired by a devout
[41:04.000 --> 41:08.000]  Satanist who carries out satanic rituals daily.
[41:08.000 --> 41:11.000]  You can go to these churches, you can feel it, boy.
[41:11.000 --> 41:20.000]  These big mega churches are chaired by devils to make sure they take the entire world down.
[41:20.000 --> 41:23.000]  And it's all in your face.
[41:23.000 --> 41:27.000]  The Newen building was pledged to Lucifer in New York City, go to the chapel and read on
[41:27.000 --> 41:28.000]  the wall.
[41:28.000 --> 41:34.000]  It says this building is dedicated to Lucifer.
[41:34.000 --> 41:41.000]  The Louvre was dedicated to Lucifer by François Mitterrand when they opened the new pink pyramid
[41:41.000 --> 41:45.000]  with 666 pieces of glass.
[41:45.000 --> 41:50.000]  This is a satanic revolution we're facing.
[41:50.000 --> 41:58.000]  And then when we have hundreds of thousands of people pouring across that we catch every month,
[41:58.000 --> 42:01.000]  sixfold whatever happened, they're rushing our borders.
[42:01.000 --> 42:05.000]  Trump gets blamed for the crisis the UN other set up.
[42:05.000 --> 42:09.000]  And again, hundreds of thousands of children a year come across, many of them disappear
[42:09.000 --> 42:11.000]  and they're not with their parents and they end up dead.
[42:11.000 --> 42:16.000]  That's in Senate reports.
[42:16.000 --> 42:22.000]  Trump tries to get more funding so we can find out who these kids are and the media and AOC,
[42:22.000 --> 42:27.000]  that demon drug addict, Crip Keeper.
[42:27.000 --> 42:31.000]  She goes, they're drinking out of toilets, being mean to them.
[42:31.000 --> 42:35.000]  These racists, KKK.
[42:35.000 --> 42:39.000]  Because her bosses are saying, you break that border, you get us those kids.
[42:39.000 --> 42:45.000]  We're paying top dollar because they need the satanic power they believe to overthrow America
[42:45.000 --> 42:48.000]  so the child's sacrifice reportedly is off the charts right now.
[42:48.000 --> 42:54.000]  They're killing kids every five minutes, torturing them, pulling their guts out, having them beg for mommy.
[42:54.000 --> 42:59.000]  They got their engines turned up on full. What are we going to do about it?
[42:59.000 --> 43:04.000]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public square.
[43:04.000 --> 43:08.000]  The other thing that's unique about Info Wars is it isn't the only network of this reach
[43:08.000 --> 43:13.000]  that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed by some billionaire,
[43:13.000 --> 43:17.000]  that's not being funded by a secret foreign government, it is completely independent of all that.
[43:17.000 --> 43:24.000]  It is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of speech
[43:24.000 --> 43:27.000]  that in fact the founders were so concerned with, at the beginning of the country,
[43:27.000 --> 43:31.000]  they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this
[43:31.000 --> 43:35.000]  because this was the kind of press they wanted and that ultimately we now live in an era
[43:35.000 --> 43:39.000]  where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies
[43:39.000 --> 43:44.000]  and have been able to control and manipulate what news it views the persons allowed to have or express or hear
[43:44.000 --> 43:47.000]  and the Info Wars audience has broken through that.
[43:47.000 --> 43:52.000]  They are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate American democracy and freedom
[43:52.000 --> 43:56.000]  and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming, defamation,
[43:56.000 --> 43:59.000]  lawfare and libel targeting youth.
[43:59.000 --> 44:02.000]  Well, we're very, very clear with everybody about all of this.
[44:02.000 --> 44:07.000]  We're going into the season of war and they have been inches from shutting down the final mega counts we have
[44:07.000 --> 44:10.000]  due to their criminal activity and their digital fraud
[44:10.000 --> 44:14.000]  and we need to know that we've got capital to go six months a year.
[44:14.000 --> 44:18.000]  We need to end here. We need to be provisioned and you've got my total commitment
[44:18.000 --> 44:21.000]  that I am going to rampage forward against the enemy fearlessly.
[44:21.000 --> 44:25.000]  I'm loving every minute of this because I know I'm getting under their skin.
[44:25.000 --> 44:27.000]  I'm bloody and then I'm up politically.
[44:27.000 --> 44:30.000]  I'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies
[44:30.000 --> 44:32.000]  and that just brings more people here.
[44:32.000 --> 44:35.000]  So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you and I need war bonds.
[44:35.000 --> 44:38.000]  I need gas. I need ammo politically now.
[44:38.000 --> 44:41.000]  But literally, if you flood us with money and if you flood us with product purchases
[44:41.000 --> 44:45.000]  and if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable. We're unstoppable together.
[44:45.000 --> 44:48.000]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy. I want to raise a couple million dollars right now
[44:48.000 --> 44:52.000]  to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing and that you will stand with us
[44:52.000 --> 44:54.000]  and I will never back down. You have my commitment.
[44:54.000 --> 44:58.000]  This only gives me more energy and more understanding of what we're facing
[44:58.000 --> 45:01.000]  and that we were right about this.
[45:01.000 --> 45:03.000]  Robert Barnes, what has Big Tech become?
[45:03.000 --> 45:06.000]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies and the way they did so
[45:06.000 --> 45:10.000]  is because they face no consequence of social, economic, political or legal
[45:10.000 --> 45:12.000]  for their illicit activities over two decades.
[45:12.000 --> 45:15.000]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries,
[45:15.000 --> 45:17.000]  the members of the independent free press that care about this,
[45:17.000 --> 45:20.000]  the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this
[45:20.000 --> 45:24.000]  have to bring real social, political, economic consequence to their course of conduct
[45:24.000 --> 45:27.000]  otherwise they will never change and they will become the Big Tech oligarchs,
[45:27.000 --> 45:30.000]  the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century who ran American politics
[45:30.000 --> 45:34.000]  and ran American economy almost into the ground until we were able to recover
[45:34.000 --> 45:35.000]  after the Great Depression.
[45:35.000 --> 45:40.000]  The informer's audience is the fuel that flames the light of liberty across the world
[45:40.000 --> 45:43.000]  to make real the actions of independent free speech,
[45:43.000 --> 45:46.000]  to make real the original promise of an independent free press.
[45:46.000 --> 45:50.000]  Real collusion is Big Tech and Big Media manipulating and working with each other
[45:50.000 --> 45:53.000]  to try to meddle with elections, to try to shake people's thoughts.
[45:53.000 --> 45:56.000]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening.
[45:56.000 --> 45:59.000]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting. What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[45:59.000 --> 46:01.000]  Even it is what we just saw.
[46:01.000 --> 46:06.000]  I just want listeners to understand money is what allows us to beat this and stand against this
[46:06.000 --> 46:10.000]  and we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the Save Info Wars 50% off
[46:10.000 --> 46:14.000]  but we make only like five, ten dollars on higher marked up stuff.
[46:14.000 --> 46:16.000]  We're making like two dollars on the toothpaste at that price
[46:16.000 --> 46:18.000]  and we're moving a ton of it, okay?
[46:18.000 --> 46:22.000]  But you move a couple hundred thousand dollars or something and you get twenty thousand dollars
[46:22.000 --> 46:25.000]  that doesn't pay for all the infrastructure, the bandwidth, the lawyers, the crew.
[46:25.000 --> 46:28.000]  So we need to sell millions and millions and millions of dollars a product.
[46:28.000 --> 46:32.000]  We want to expand, not contract. And for six months we've not just made a standstill.
[46:32.000 --> 46:36.000]  The enemy's been winning and I have labored and labored and labored and labored on this.
[46:36.000 --> 46:39.000]  I like to be expanding. I like to be winning. I like to be fighting.
[46:39.000 --> 46:41.000]  And we are winning the Info War. That's why we're so hated.
[46:41.000 --> 46:45.000]  But we need to be retreaded. We need to be tuned up. We need to be fixed up.
[46:45.000 --> 46:48.000]  We never have time to get into drought. We got a lot of holes shot at us.
[46:48.000 --> 46:53.000]  And the enemy wants to silence us. Then they're really going to plant child porn on us.
[46:53.000 --> 46:55.000]  Then they're going to kill me or you or anybody else.
[46:55.000 --> 46:59.000]  Democrats now are going into a full revolutionary fervor funded by foreign banks and tricombs.
[46:59.000 --> 47:28.000]  So go to infowarstore.com.
[47:29.000 --> 47:45.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, you know, I almost want to apologize for covering all these horrible topics here.
[47:45.000 --> 47:49.000]  But it's got to be done. That's how evil operates is in the shadows.
[47:49.000 --> 47:55.000]  Tommy Robinson's got a huge global announcement and direct message to President Trump.
[47:55.000 --> 48:00.000]  And I'm going to let him basically host the next hour so we can go through all of this.
[48:00.000 --> 48:04.000]  But just tell everyone you know, tune in right now. That's how we're overpowering the censors.
[48:04.000 --> 48:07.000]  It's how we are word of mouth, crushing the globalists.
[48:07.000 --> 48:10.000]  They're pulling out every stop, every one of their operatives against us.
[48:10.000 --> 48:15.000]  But you and your prayers and your support are incredible.
[48:15.000 --> 48:20.000]  So the articles posted on news wars.com, please share it on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, everywhere else.
[48:20.000 --> 48:27.000]  You do not want to miss this special broadcast, huge Trump developments and more carpe dongtum.
[48:27.000 --> 48:38.000]  Isn't just getting invited with over 100 people that are libertarians, conservatives, Christian media that are successful in social media and memes.
[48:38.000 --> 48:41.000]  It's really a meme conference. They're calling it a social media conference.
[48:41.000 --> 48:45.000]  He was at the White House last week.
[48:45.000 --> 48:51.000]  I want some of the photos of that. And he's not going to get into a lot of what he and Trump talked about.
[48:51.000 --> 49:00.000]  We had a discussion about it, but I've talked to other folks that have also had long conversations with Trump confirming where his mind is, what he's doing,
[49:00.000 --> 49:03.000]  and what the plan is. He is intending to take action.
[49:03.000 --> 49:14.000]  He just wants to hear from the troops about their ideas before he prepares to execute operations against the shield and the bullhorn of the globalists, the chicoms.
[49:14.000 --> 49:24.000]  And that is big tech giants, Google, Facebook, Twitter, and of course the kingpins of evil, the folks at Apple.
[49:24.000 --> 49:33.000]  So that is all coming up in the third hour. Believe me, you don't want to miss that.
[49:33.000 --> 49:41.000]  Now, I mean, just look at all these articles. I just mentioned a bunch of stuff that I have here.
[49:41.000 --> 49:53.000]  Stack after stack after stack after stack after stack after stack of the most obscene globalist garbage.
[49:53.000 --> 50:05.000]  And this is just what they admit. Going to islands where kidnapped 12-year-old girls were taken for Bill Clinton and others to have sex with them.
[50:05.000 --> 50:16.000]  And that's what they're admitting. Tied into the nexium sex cult, snuff films, all of it.
[50:16.000 --> 50:26.000]  People are so naive. I remember 20 years ago being on air and I'd be reading some law enforcement report where they had convictions for the people trafficking in it to LA in the VHS tapes
[50:26.000 --> 50:38.000]  and confirmed little kids being tortured and killed. And people call it a show because it wasn't TV then. And they'd say, there's no way that's true.
[50:38.000 --> 50:46.000]  There's no way our national parks have been signed over to the UN. There's no way they're keeping babies alive.
[50:46.000 --> 50:50.000]  There's no way they take blood at birth from your baby and send for a blood test, but it's really sent to the UN.
[50:50.000 --> 50:58.000]  All of that is known now. All of that is confirmed. Just like everything else we talk about.
[50:58.000 --> 51:08.000]  And we've made real sacrifices to be here on air. And we fought hard and thanks to you we are here.
[51:08.000 --> 51:14.000]  So I want every listener to understand something. I am honored to be in this position.
[51:14.000 --> 51:25.000]  I am thankful no matter how bad the persecution is because somebody's got to stand up for the unborn and for the already born being killed and for all these little children.
[51:25.000 --> 51:28.000]  And we go out to these Democrat events. We're not cherry picking.
[51:28.000 --> 51:35.000]  And these women walk over and we've got to enforce Mike Flag or when we don't use enforce Mike flags, we can really hear what they think.
[51:35.000 --> 51:44.000]  Look, I'm so sick of these little kids. I say kill them up to age three. So annoying to hear their little mouths running.
[51:44.000 --> 51:49.000]  That was just a few weeks ago we got that on tape. We've got dozens of these in just the last month.
[51:49.000 --> 51:55.000]  You've seen me play them where the operating system of these demon possessed people is just they walk over.
[51:55.000 --> 51:58.000]  Women always walk real crazy kind of billionaire strut.
[51:58.000 --> 52:06.000]  They just go, I might kill some kids. Yeah, children must be gotten rid of little bastards, little voices.
[52:06.000 --> 52:12.000]  I mean, what frickin space alien is this man? Because it's not women.
[52:12.000 --> 52:16.000]  And after you've been to enough of these rallies, you know, video, it's like the same creature.
[52:16.000 --> 52:26.000]  It talks the same. It acts the same. Just like something out of Hellraiser or something out of the exorcist.
[52:26.000 --> 52:34.000]  But it's worse than the exorcist. Linda Blair couldn't act as scary as the real deal.
[52:34.000 --> 52:39.000]  Go out and see them. Go out and look at them. They're everywhere now.
[52:39.000 --> 52:46.000]  Humans are losing their souls en masse. Just like the Bible says, in the end times demons will run rampant.
[52:46.000 --> 52:55.000]  Large portions of the population will be demon possessed. Hell will be opened up.
[52:55.000 --> 53:02.000]  I remember sitting there in church hearing that in real churches in Dallas and thinking, man, that's crazy.
[53:02.000 --> 53:11.000]  And then you actually see it. I'll kill my children. I want to kill more. I've paid for 50 abortions.
[53:11.000 --> 53:15.000]  That's what they say. I love it.
[53:15.000 --> 53:18.000]  And then you see the undercover videos at their own antifa meetings.
[53:18.000 --> 53:21.000]  They'll be like laughing about how you like to have sexual kids.
[53:21.000 --> 53:28.000]  They'll kill those little bastards and they all look ugly and soul sucked and shriveled.
[53:28.000 --> 53:37.000]  These are people that have shakam. They have shakam. It's real.
[53:37.000 --> 53:42.000]  Darren put that clip together about a week ago that's got like 15 clips of how those little kids screw them,
[53:42.000 --> 53:47.000]  get in there and crush them, murder them, get rid of those little trashy bastards.
[53:47.000 --> 53:54.000]  It's so much fun to kill a baby, watch them fight for their lives and that scalpel comes from them.
[53:54.000 --> 54:00.000]  Again, I didn't know all this stuff 25 years ago when I would go protest at an abortion clinic because I felt guilty
[54:00.000 --> 54:05.000]  because I'd been involved in someone I was younger and didn't know.
[54:05.000 --> 54:08.000]  And man, people walk over and they'd also just go, I'm going to get you.
[54:08.000 --> 54:11.000]  You're like, whoa.
[54:11.000 --> 54:16.000]  Well, of course they're in there killing babies all day. What type of person do you think you do that?
[54:16.000 --> 54:21.000]  God removes protection from you and whatever this space junk is, whatever these programs are,
[54:21.000 --> 54:27.000]  we all know how computers work in programs. We are electrochemical and these viruses get into us and take us over.
[54:27.000 --> 54:31.000]  That's what this is. It's scientific. I don't know all the details.
[54:31.000 --> 54:34.000]  The Bible says once we will find out and we won't believe it all. It'll be so incredible.
[54:34.000 --> 54:38.000]  I hasn't seen, here hasn't heard. No one's imagined what this really is.
[54:38.000 --> 54:43.000]  But when we find out, isn't it going to be interesting?
[54:43.000 --> 54:48.000]  And don't you just want to be with God forever instead of Satan?
[54:48.000 --> 54:53.000]  All right, I'm going to come back with that abortion four minute video that McBrain put together.
[54:53.000 --> 54:56.000]  There's only a small sampling of the worship of killing babies and I've played a lot.
[54:56.000 --> 55:04.000]  I want you to see who these people are. This is out in the open. This is keeping them comfortable.
[55:04.000 --> 55:08.000]  It's all sick. Oh, they're not a human. Oh, they don't have a life. Oh, we decided to kill them.
[55:08.000 --> 55:14.000]  But after we harvest them, we keep them comfortable though.
[55:14.000 --> 55:19.000]  We're going to go to break. I still don't show anymore. I can't look at it. Okay. Thanks.
[55:19.000 --> 55:25.000]  We're going to go to break. Haunting. And we're going to come back.
[55:25.000 --> 55:31.000]  I've got a bunch of big initiatives that are super exciting that are going on behind the scenes.
[55:31.000 --> 55:35.000]  I'm going to leave it at that. Info wars is not all that we're doing.
[55:35.000 --> 55:38.000]  There's a lot of reasons they really want us dead. Okay.
[55:38.000 --> 55:44.000]  But I've got some opportunities for some initiatives that I know in my gut spiritually,
[55:44.000 --> 55:51.000]  but also just from my research at a business level, fighting the globalist as a business model,
[55:51.000 --> 55:59.000]  that's how we're successful, that will not major holes in their guts, not holes in their heads politically.
[55:59.000 --> 56:05.000]  I want to sink globalist operations. I want to savage the living hell out of them. And I've got major plans
[56:05.000 --> 56:09.000]  that I know I can execute within just three months.
[56:09.000 --> 56:14.000]  And boy, as the enemy, the enemy's obviously got all my phones tapped. They know all this stuff.
[56:14.000 --> 56:17.000]  They're just hoping. They're just hoping. So I was thinking this weekend, I said,
[56:17.000 --> 56:21.000]  why don't I just come tell everybody why I need a bunch of money?
[56:21.000 --> 56:25.000]  It's not just to pay lawyers or fight fake lawsuits. None of that's going to matter two years from now.
[56:25.000 --> 56:29.000]  That's why the enemy doesn't care and lies about everything. And it is so crazy now.
[56:29.000 --> 56:31.000]  What we do now is what matters. And they know that.
[56:31.000 --> 56:35.000]  So Info Wars is winning. And we've got all sorts of systems.
[56:35.000 --> 56:40.000]  And we have got absolute directives from the president.
[56:40.000 --> 56:43.000]  Directives from the president to intensify operations.
[56:43.000 --> 56:47.000]  And he's surrounded by a bunch of cowards and bootlickers, but there's some good people in there.
[56:47.000 --> 56:51.000]  But the president is really starting to make some moves. I'll leave it at that.
[56:51.000 --> 56:55.000]  And I had some very interesting conversations last week. I'll leave it at that.
[56:55.000 --> 56:58.000]  Very interesting conversation yesterday. I'll leave it at that.
[56:58.000 --> 57:04.000]  But I need money. There's no sugar daddy. There's no globalists. There's none of that.
[57:04.000 --> 57:08.000]  The Koch brothers give money to Democrats. They were never Republicans. That's a cover story.
[57:08.000 --> 57:11.000]  They gave money to Republicans to take control of them.
[57:11.000 --> 57:15.000]  They're funding against me, by the way. Not just Soros, not just Hillary, but, you know,
[57:15.000 --> 57:19.000]  I'm up against the big dogs. OK? It's OK.
[57:19.000 --> 57:22.000]  We are smart. You are smart.
[57:22.000 --> 57:27.000]  You need to go to infowarstore.com. This is the last day because I got a new special start tomorrow.
[57:27.000 --> 57:30.000]  Put the 50% off.
[57:30.000 --> 57:33.000]  Storewide free shipping. Double patriot points. Save Info Wars.
[57:33.000 --> 57:37.000]  What was your last special? This is the last day. All the products are excellent.
[57:37.000 --> 57:39.000]  And the new Betsy Ross flags.
[57:39.000 --> 57:43.000]  New Betsy Ross flag shirts are selling out super fast. That's great.
[57:43.000 --> 57:47.000]  There's going to be lots of funding. So thanks for the support. Infowarstore.com.
[57:47.000 --> 57:49.000]  Take action. We will win.
[57:49.000 --> 57:55.000]  We will always be the people who defeated a tyrant, crossed the continent,
[57:55.000 --> 58:01.000]  harness science, took to the skies, and soared into the heavens.
[58:01.000 --> 58:08.000]  Because we will never forget that we are Americans and the future belongs to us.
[58:08.000 --> 58:15.000]  The future belongs to the brave, the strong, the proud, and the free.
[58:15.000 --> 58:22.000]  We are one people chasing one dream and one magnificent destiny.
[58:22.000 --> 58:28.000]  We all share the same heroes, the same home, the same heart,
[58:28.000 --> 58:33.000]  and we are all made by the same Almighty God.
[58:33.000 --> 58:39.000]  Infowarstore.com. Tomorrow's news today.
[58:39.000 --> 58:42.000]  Full power of the Republic in the name of Jesus Christ.
[58:42.000 --> 59:04.000]  Full power. Damn the torpedoes. Go straight at them.
[59:12.000 --> 59:19.000]  The audience determines what content goes up.
[59:19.000 --> 59:24.000]  The audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices in supporting Infowarstore.
[59:24.000 --> 59:27.000]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is,
[59:27.000 --> 59:31.000]  whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want
[59:31.000 --> 59:35.000]  that actually compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that
[59:35.000 --> 59:40.000]  and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose
[59:40.000 --> 59:43.000]  what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[59:43.000 --> 59:46.000]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment
[59:46.000 --> 01:00:15.000]  and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000]  Well, the article's up on infowarstore.com and newswarstore.com.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:23.000]  The exclusive big announcement with Tommy Robinson coming up in the next segment.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:28.000]  You'll want to go learn what he's calling for and what he said why it's so important.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.000]  It's bigger than Tommy Robinson. Wait till he break it down.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:37.000]  Then I'm going to go over the details of the internal war inside the government
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.000]  to bring down the deep state whose currency is the trafficking and organ harvesting
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.000]  and killing of children. There's hundreds of different ways they do it,
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:49.000]  but at the end of the day it's about degrading God's most precious creations
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:53.000]  and children made the image of God that are the seed and the potential of the universe.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.000]  And here's the enemy whose religion is attacking children.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  Our main story tonight concerns breast implants.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.000]  Some are against them, others believe they're fine in rare cases
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.000]  and many believe you should be able to get them whenever the f*** you want.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.000]  Sorry, did I say breast implants? I meant abortions.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  Tonight's main topic concerns abortion.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.000]  So tonight, in honor of America, I'd like to do a salute to abortion
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  in the great 10th annual salute to abortion.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.000]  Get out of my behind! Get out of my vagina! Get out!
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  It's a woman's body and she should not be forced to carry anything inside of it.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000]  You wouldn't make her keep a tapeworm.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000]  So you're comparing a baby to a tapeworm?
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  A fetus is a parasite, sweetie.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  You think that it is the white man's duty to fix everybody's problems, right?
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.000]  How many did I adopt? I killed my kids.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  Well, that's what you do to babies, huh?
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  Yeah, I love it.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.000]  You love it, huh?
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000]  Yeah, I do.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  Okay, I hope that you come to Christ, sir.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  Oh, I'd never go to Christ.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000]  I hope that you come to Christ, sir.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000]  No, I don't go to Christ.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  A fertilized egg is a human being!
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000]  Yeah.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000]  A fertilized egg is a human being!
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  You're a pain.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.000]  Because I don't want to come to babies.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  How you kill them, you let them live so they can starve to death.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000]  Why'd you spit at us?
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.000]  I don't agree with you.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000]  No uterus, no right to talk about it.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  Understand me, motherfucker?
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:30.000]  In the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000]  just prior to the birth of the baby.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000]  Now, you can say that that's okay,
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:40.000]  and Hillary can say that that's okay, but it's not okay with me.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  Well, that is not what happens in these cases,
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:47.000]  and using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:52.000]  New York Governor Andrew Cuomo lit up the One World Trade Center's Spire in Pink
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.000]  to celebrate his erotical expansion of abortion in New York.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.000]  State lawmakers approved a law permitting abortion in the state
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:04.000]  for any reason until the 24th week of pregnancy, and then up until birth.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.000]  If a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.000]  The infant would be delivered, the infant would be kept comfortable,
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  the infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired,
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000]  There was a question over here.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:27.000]  Yes, are you for third trimester abortions?
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:31.000]  The answer to you is that that should be a decision that the woman makes.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:38.000]  There's scientific consensus that the lives of children are going to be very difficult.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000]  Is it okay to still have children?
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:46.000]  How do you justify the decision to allow Planned Parenthood to rent in this city for free?
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  It's your time.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  Next speaker.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:57.000]  A new video out on m4wars.com of two partial birth abortions, eight and a half month old babies,
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.000]  and it makes you want to kill people.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  I'm going to just be honest with you right now.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:10.000]  My guts, my spirit sees a baby who got killed and its brain sucked out by some asshole,
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  and then they make a joke out of it.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  These are abortion doctors with third trimester babies
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  that were about to be born defiling them, making jokes about them that they're having a fight.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:27.000]  They're playing with dead babies in a little medical pan,
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:32.000]  and it was pretty shocking through some stuff to see and just a total lack of regard for humanity.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000]  That's just absolutely amazing.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:39.000]  We're going to have Debbie Johnson. I'm sorry.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:46.000]  God bless abortions and God bless America!

[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000]  And when you do try it, really knock it.

[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:38.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:47.000]  There is a war on journalists across the world. We know that's happening in China where they jail and even kill them.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:55.000]  We get political asylum all the time to Cuban journalists because they face prison for reporting on what the state has been doing.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.000]  Here's an example right here.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:10.000]  Cuban journalist Sefron Moran granted asylum in the United States because he was being persecuted because he wasn't being allowed to do his reporting and faced jail.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.000]  Well, look at the UK.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:19.000]  Look at areas of the EU where they arrest people that report on Islamic child kidnapping rings.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:23.000]  Well, who first exposed that 12 years ago?
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000]  Tommy Robinson.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000]  He saw them with little girdles as young as 10.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:31.000]  Someone ended up dead, cut up and put into kebab machines, sold his meat on the street.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.000]  That's mainstream news.
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.000]  Was Tommy Robinson exposed this?
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:43.000]  Girdles trafficked in some towns by the thousands just in towns.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:48.000]  The trafficking of women is part of the Islamic system in many nations of the world.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.000]  Not just places like Somalia, but Pakistan.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000]  The list goes on and on.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.000]  And Tommy Robinson is a political prisoner.
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000]  He spent over a year in prison.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000]  They acid attacked him.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:05.000]  He was thrown in for three months in solitary confinement, lost almost 40 pounds this year.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000]  It's a big news story.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.000]  Dr. Carlson had him on.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:14.000]  He's been out on appeal for the crime of committing journalism.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000]  That's what it is.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000]  And now they found him in three counts of contempt.
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.000]  He could serve years in solitary confinement, which is a death sentence.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.000]  But because it's the UK, we go, oh, well, that's all right.
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000]  You know, they just got rid of free speech over there.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.000]  But it's not like Cuba when they do it.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:35.000]  So Tommy Robinson is going to have the floor for the rest of the hour.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.000]  I'll intro and outro.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000]  We're going to break in seven minutes.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000]  He sent us a special report video.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.000]  He just compiled.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000]  He's about to premiere.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:48.000]  And this is going to be his request to the president.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:52.000]  Well, I'll just let him say it himself.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:58.000]  Tommy, you're a hero to so many and absolutely don't want to see you disappear as they're planning.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000]  I know you first just want to give the basic facts.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000]  The president will probably have five minutes to just watch this.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.000]  I know we can get it to him.
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:16.000]  And then obviously you're going to give a report to his staff who can look into the case and see that it's just as bad of stuff that happens in Cuba or other authoritarian states and that you and your family absolutely need political emergency asylum.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000]  I have the US code right here.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.000]  We'll go over towards the end of the hour, but you have the floor my friend.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000]  And so thank you for joining us.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.000]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:30.000]  I've got a lot of information I want to get across so people can understand exactly what's happening in the UK.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:34.000]  This week I was found guilty on three counts of contempt to court by two judges.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.000]  There was no jury to find me guilty to appointed judges.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.000]  As I sat in court, I couldn't believe what I was hearing.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:48.000]  Both judges found me guilty because they believed I breached a rapport restriction on a Muslim child gang rape trial.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:59.000]  They also came to a conclusion that me photograph in Muslim child rapists while asking them simple questions before they entered court for their verdicts created anxiety for the poor Muslim pedophiles.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:04.000]  Though I am now to be punished with a full might of the British judicial system.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.000]  My name is Tommy Robinson.
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:18.000]  Today I'm calling on the help of Donald Trump, his administration and the Republican party to grant me and my family political asylum in the United States of America.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.000]  I'm sat in today before you to make my case of political persecution.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:27.000]  I have been found guilty of what is the equivalent of exercising First Amendment rights.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:31.000]  Benjamin Franklin had the foresight to know this.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:36.000]  Whoever would overthrow the liberty of a nation must begin by subduing the freeness of speech.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:51.000]  For more than 10 years I've been proactive voice, highlighting the industrialized grooming, the pimping, the beating and the raping of young vulnerable British girls up and down the length and breadth of my once great country.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:11:06.000]  To obsessive British governments have sought to silence me, to persecute me and for what? Trying to stop vulnerable young girls from being sex slaves to gangs of predominantly predatory Muslim men who drugged them, raped them and beat them for years.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:15.000]  I have tried not continue to try to get the British government to take action and stop the systematic child abuse that's still going on right now as we sit on screen.
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:24.000]  These young victims of Muslim rape gangs have been let down so badly it started at the very top of the Labour-controlled government under Gordon Brown as Prime Minister.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  The stories are harrowing, disturbing, upsetting.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:35.000]  Believe me, I've sat down and I've cried my eyes out of a sat and heard the stories from victim after victim and family after family.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:41.000]  Let me outline to you what has happened in the second trial from contempt to court.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:47.000]  The original verdict was appealed due to unfairness and no due process.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:54.000]  There were no charges of prejudice in the case or potentially collapse in the trial as the media continued to push out.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:04.000]  They originally tried to bring those charges last year but had to remove them as it's been proved in court twice that nothing I said in my live stream could have prejudiced the jury.
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:15.000]  One charge was for breaching a reporting restriction, the other two charges were for photographing the defendants whilst entering court and according to the judge, aggressively questioning them.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:26.000]  Both of these acts the Attorney General and the government have claimed could have made these poor Muslim child rapists feel anxious and therefore not able to participate in their trial.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:31.000]  This is despite the fact that the trial had already finished, they had nothing to participate in.
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:38.000]  The trial had finished, the jury had retired to decide their verdict which all came back as guilty.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:45.000]  I just want to show you now so your American audience understand. Let's look at the anxiety charges first.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  Let me show you what I actually said outside Leeds Crown Court.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:55.000]  I'm at Leeds Crown Court where these men here, let me see.
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:01.000]  How are you feeling about your verdict?
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:05.000]  How are you feeling about your verdict?
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.000]  You got your prison back are you?
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:13.000]  How are you feeling about the verdict?
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:17.000]  You've got no guilt, is there any guilt?
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:25.000]  My wife's a prostitute, my wife's a prostitute.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:30.000]  What are you in court for today?
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:34.000]  You've been seeing my mum, another comment about a woman.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:39.000]  What are you in court for? How's the trial going?
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:43.000]  How's the trial going?
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:49.000]  I'm the one in court.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:14:08.000]  Another comment about your mum, that's every single alleged person who's walked into court today has made sexual references about women.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:16.000]  What are you in court for?
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:30.000]  This is the verdict, so the trials ended, the jury are making their mind up and this is the verdict.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:40.000]  Michael is going to explain what's going to happen next.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:50.000]  I'm being arrested for breaching a piece.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:15:01.000]  You've all watched this, you've all watched this, you've all watched this, you've all watched this, you've all watched this.
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:07.000]  Can you get me a slither?
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:16.000]  What does that mean?
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:22.000]  Now, former political prisoner Tommy Robinson's with us, we're about to go break, he'll come back and be able to respond to this.
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.000]  He's got more exhibits, but this is one of the reasons he's going to prison.
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:30.000]  He's standing out front when he's the guy that first exposed all this, they've been convicted.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:37.000]  Just like any other media would do, just like England did before, saying hey, how do you feel about being convicted?
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:44.000]  They say you were born out your mother's rear end, your wife says it's a religion under these guys, of degradating women.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000]  Don't worry, these guys degradate your daughters real good.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000]  That little age eight year olds.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:53.000]  And if they run their mouths too much, some of these guys cut them up and feed them to people at kebab shops.
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:58.000]  That's a bigger Muslim joke, you see, to feed you your dead daughters.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:09.000]  When you have a pain in the neck, a real pain in the neck, back, shoulder or legs, you now have two convenient choices to get fast relief without taking another pill.

[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:06.000]  As we gather this evening in the joy of freedom, we remember that all share a truly extraordinary heritage.
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:12.000]  Together we are part of one of the greatest stories ever told, the story of America.
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:22.000]  It is the epic tale of a great nation whose people have risked everything for what they know is right and what they know is true.
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:48.000]  As long as we stay true to our codes, as long as we remember our great history, as long as we never ever stop fighting for a better future, then there will be nothing that America cannot do.

[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:21.000]  Journalism is under massive attack across the Western world.
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:27.000]  President Trump was taken action when Sheriff Arpaio was being wrongfully imprisoned, gave him a pardon.
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:35.000]  The Submariner from 20 years ago who'd taken a photo of his workstation that wasn't even secret, he was sent to prison, Trump gave him a pardon.
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:40.000]  Well Tommy Robinson is a hero across the UK and Europe and here.
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:49.000]  He's just a mainline guy that exposed, he owned a business, a tanning salon right next to it that were Muslim grooming gangs with little girls.
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:54.000]  He's like, hey mate, what are you doing? Put little girls in guys' cars, you're obviously pimping them. Who's your daddy?
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000]  They started threatening Tommy.
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:00.000]  Tommy stood up to him, reported him, got put in prison for fighting back.
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:01.000]  He fights back.
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:02.000]  He's been attacked by Antifa.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000]  You've seen all the videos of them attacking him in public.
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000]  He fights back.
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000]  Antifa, the Islamists, all of it.
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000]  This is only an eight-minute segment, longer segment coming up.
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:15.000]  Tommy, you just showed the first exhibit of why they're sitting in a prison daring to talk to guys who you were polite to.
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:18.000]  They insulted your family.
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:25.000]  Just greasy thugs who were convicted of grooming children for sex traffic.
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:28.000]  And of course, they gave them light sentences.
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:29.000]  You've talked about it all.
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000]  This is another reason you need Trump.
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:32.000]  You're asking for Trump.
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.000]  We'll get to this.
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:34.000]  We'll get to the US Code.
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:43.000]  There are 22 US Code 6401 findings and policy that you are a prime candidate as a journalist to get political emergency asylum.
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000]  But you're being sent to President Thursday.
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000]  Please continue.
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:50.000]  I've had a few people mention me saying that I've seen tents.
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.000]  It's because I am tense.
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:57.000]  I feel like I'm two days away from being sentenced to death in the UK for journalism.
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.000]  Let's be clear.
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:03.000]  The video you just watched, the questions I asked, I asked them as follows.
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:04.000]  All right, lads.
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000]  How are you feeling?
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000]  How are you feeling about your verdict?
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.000]  All right, mate.
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.000]  How are you doing?
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.000]  Are you all right?
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:12.000]  Hello, mate.
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:15.000]  What are you in court for today if you don't mind me asking?
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:18.000]  How's the trial gone, bro?
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:25.000]  As you can see, I was actually very polite despite some of the disgusting abuse that was thrown my way.
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:28.000]  I claim in that these questions were in any way aggressive.
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:34.000]  I'm not claiming, he said that he skipped this in his summing up, the judge has said my aggressive question.
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:44.000]  The judge has had to say that and the prosecution has simply lied in court, in open court, in order to back up their ridiculous charge of causing the defendant's anxiety.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:51.000]  Now, these monsters have been previously been kidnapping and raping young children in gangs for years.
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:56.000]  In full view of everyone, including the social services, the police forces, everyone doing what's happening.
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:59.000]  They don't sound like the anxious type to me.
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:03.000]  If these men were anxious, it's because they were facing a court case.
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:06.000]  They're all now subsequently doing 15 years in prison.
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.000]  They were facing a court case.
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.000]  They knew they were guilty.
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000]  They raped dozens of young children.
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:16.000]  Yet somehow, me asking them a simple question as a journalist, I'm now being convicted for causing them anxiety.
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:19.000]  One of them pushed me in the chest, told me to go fuck myself.
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:23.000]  I simply said, all right, mate, what are you in court for?
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:31.000]  The other three of child rapist monsters coincidentally all made disgusting and vulgar sexual references about female members of my family.
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:36.000]  One thing's for sure, none of them look remotely anxious.
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:40.000]  According to the attorney general and the judge, I was aggressive.
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:45.000]  And in the words of the prosecution, I molested them as they entered court.
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:49.000]  No, this is what they said in court, molested them.
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:53.000]  These are the guys that have molested and raped children for a decade.
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:24:00.000]  The attorney general and actually in their prosecution said that these men must be free to go and come from court without fear of molestation.
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:07.000]  The reality is with 16 child statements, witness statements, they shouldn't have been free to come and go from court at all.
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:10.000]  They should have been on remand.
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:11.000]  Let's have a look at me now.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:14.000]  You've seen that footage that I have just been convicted of.
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.000]  You've seen the footage.
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.000]  Let's have a look at the footage of me entering the Old Bailey for this trial.
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000]  Let me show you this now.
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:26.000]  How many of you go to Christiostas for potentially collapsing this trial?
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.000]  I didn't potentially collapse any trial.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:28.000]  I'm actually not in charge.
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000]  I'm not on trial for potentially collapsing trial.
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:35.000]  My charge is causing anxiety to the men walking into court by putting cameras and asking questions.
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:39.000]  Exactly what you've just done to me is what I face contempt of court for.
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.000]  Exactly this.
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.000]  Do you think this is causing my anxiety?
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000]  Look, look at your actions.
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000]  That's what I'm facing trial for.
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:51.000]  This is a facade.
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:52.000]  The whole public know that.
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000]  That's why the public hear this from me.
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.000]  No, I didn't nearly collapse.
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:56.000]  That's a lie.
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:57.000]  You're lying.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.000]  You're lying.
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:24:59.000]  I didn't nearly collapse.
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:02.000]  The judge's words in that case, nothing I said because I've already prejudiced the jury.
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.000]  Nothing.
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.000]  That's the judge's words.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:05.000]  That's the judge's words.
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:06.000]  Read the transcript.
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000]  Do your job as a journalist.
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000]  Are you in contempt of court?
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.000]  No, I wasn't.
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000]  That's why I was released from prison.
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000]  The whole case was unlawful.
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:20.000]  This is politically motivated persecution by a government who want the silence.
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:21.000]  That's what this is.
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:24.000]  What do you think about the fact that all these charges back?
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000]  I think it tells everyone the fact.
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:27.000]  Look at what's happening here.
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.000]  Can you see this?
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:31.000]  I'm in court for causing them anxiety.
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.000]  Look at all these cameras.
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.000]  Look at all these journalists.
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:34.000]  Stunning footage.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:37.000]  Tommy Robinson is hosting this show.
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000]  He's about to take back over again.
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:40.000]  This is the Alex Jones show.
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:45.000]  He's doing a direct appeal to President Trump for a journalistic asylum because the UK is
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:46.000]  now a police state.
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:51.000]  If you're a radio listener, these are dozens of cameras and people pressed around him, pressing
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000]  in on him, saying he's a bad person.
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:59.000]  As he goes in for the kangaroo court to be convicted of talking to people that were convicted
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:04.000]  in the street, and he says, I've been convicted for what you're doing right now, and they
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000]  just look at him with hate because these aren't media.
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000]  These are authoritarian lap dogs.
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000]  This is how far the UK's fallen.
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:14.000]  Back to your statement, my friend.
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:19.000]  As you can see, that was me on my way into court, just like the Muslim child rapist on
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.000]  their way into court.
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:23.000]  Lucy Mannen, leading BBC political broadcaster.
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:27.000]  She blocked my path along with multiple other journalists and media cameraman.
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:30.000]  She was far more aggressive in her line of questioning.
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000]  She even assumed my guilt.
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000]  Now you're finally going to face justice.
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:35.000]  That was her words.
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.000]  She assumed my guilt.
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:39.000]  I'm not saying anything she's done there is wrong.
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:42.000]  I'm saying that is robust journalism.
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000]  That's what we're witnessing.
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.000]  That's all I've done.
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:49.000]  Well, what she is is a collaborator with the Islamist system.
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000]  She's got a job to throw your ass in prison.
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.000]  It's the BBC that famously has always covered up her pedophilia.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.000]  That's their known thing.
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:58.000]  So she's told you go stop him.
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.000]  Please continue.
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:04.000]  Even Alex, on first day for the first day of my trial, every single newspaper published
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:08.000]  a picture of me in court, every single one of them, according to the Attorney General,
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000]  that is now contempt to court.
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:15.000]  We played that video of Lucy Mannen in court as evidence along with many other videos such
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:19.000]  as Ralph Harris being pretty much crushed by the press on his way into court.
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:24.000]  The judge and prosecution completely ignored the fact that every other newspaper and
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:29.000]  journalists, questions and photographs defendants entering court every single day across my
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:30.000]  country.
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:35.000]  But in my specific case, the Attorney General was decided for the first time in British history
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:40.000]  when Tommy Robinson politely questions the now convicted Muslim child rapists.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:45.000]  It amounts contempt to court, and it could have interfered with the court proceedings
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:49.000]  by leaving the defendants in an anxious state of mind.
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:54.000]  I knew the entire system was corrupt when the judge unbelievably agreed with the Attorney
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:55.000]  General.
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000]  This has effectively set a precedent.
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:01.000]  Questioning any defendant is contempt of court.
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:05.000]  Will you ever see another journalist arrested and prosecuted for asking questions or photographs
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000]  in a defendant entering court?
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.000]  Of course you won't.
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:12.000]  The Attorney General spent five months trying to invent something they can fit me up with,
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:18.000]  and therefore this will be a complete one-off designed solely to fit up Tommy Robinson.
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000]  Tommy, stay there.
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:23.000]  When you come back, I want you to do your appeal directly to the President, but I want to be
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:24.000]  clear here.
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:27.000]  TV viewers can see all this, radio listeners can hear it.
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:28.000]  It's so shocking.
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.000]  I think you're wrong, though.
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:33.000]  They're setting the precedent for everybody to be arrested who is a patriot who's in the
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:34.000]  media.
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.000]  What they're really doing is outlawing journalism, and we haven't told people yet how they send
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:38.000]  anti-foot of your house.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:42.000]  They send the Muslims of your house saying they're going to ask to attack you, threatening
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.000]  your family.
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:44.000]  This is your young children, your wife.
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:48.000]  You need to get out of there and you're asking President Trump for emergency journalism
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:49.000]  asylum.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000]  You are the textbook case for it.
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000]  Stay with us.

[01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:18.000]  Those people who are online making fun of members of Congress are this grace and there's no need for anyone to think that is unacceptable. We're going to shut them down and work with whoever it is to shut them down and they should be prosecuted.
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:32.000]  So this is bigger than Tommy Robinson is a great hero and a good friend of mine and just don't know his whole history. You have a bestselling book about an action hero or something and it would seem just unbelievable but truth is stranger than fiction.
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:42.000]  We won't be able to operate though. We don't have funding so let me just briefly say this. This is the last day of the save info wars July 4th special. This will be the last day. New specials tomorrow.
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:49:04.000]  But this is one of our biggest and most extensive ever store wide free shipping double patriot points and 50% off all of our bestselling supplements. That's the brain force, the turbo force, the survival shield X to the super non vitality, the amazing fluoride free toothpaste, super blue, four to five o'clock silver and iodine and your purchase makes it all possible and one other interesting issue.
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:18.000]  You know, we do limited edition t shirts and sometimes we only sell like 500 or one. Sometimes we sell a couple thousands. Sometimes we sell 20 30,000. That helps fun things. It takes a lot of money to run this. I've got some big exciting operations that we won't get credit for.
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:31.000]  But that's not what this is about. Oh, it's not just what you see here. A lot of stuff you see out there. Other folks are getting credit for I don't want the credit submarines run silent run deadly run deep.
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:42.000]  And what you see here is just the tip of the iceberg. I will show you. I need warfare operation funds. If you want me to go out and destroy the globalist politically, I can destroy them with their help.
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:54.000]  We've already gone so far together. We've already paid a lot. They're trying to plant child born on me now. You know about it all. I've seen a lot of support come in since then people are like, Oh my God, exactly folks, this is hard core.
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:50:03.000]  Of course, they got caught. The fact it was all lie. But this is such a dangerous time in four store dot com in fours life dot com.
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:16.000]  Tommy can tell you my bragging is that times that he's needed money for what's going on. Hey, $30,000 boom, you know, and a lot of other folks you don't know about that I send checks a lot bigger than that to for their strategic operations.
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:25.000]  So if you understand the enemy wants me off the air for good reason, because they don't want me to have contact with you to get funding that we then turn loose to others with no strings attached.
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:34.000]  Because we already know they've done a great job. I'm trying to run a war here. I'm trying to win. I believe in you. And your purchases now are critical.
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:46.000]  The Betsy Ross flag, which night he's pulled off or sings racist, even though she was an abolitionist, you know, that's the group that got slavery banned. She designed the American flag. She's amazing.
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:53.000]  They're pulling it everywhere. Well, guess what? I had an idea that if we put out a limited edition shirt, they've now arrived or shipping out now that you'd like it.
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:51:04.000]  One is the Betsy Ross flag with 1776 founded 1776 on the back. It says America's back in fours dot com. People love it. The other one is even a better seller. They're about to sell out. I said, I'm only printing 4,000.
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:11.000]  I thought it would take a month to sell that many. We've already sold out 2000 as of this morning. So a lot of sizes are about to be gone.
[01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:23.000]  Then we have the other one that's white and says America's back in fours dot com on the back on the front. The Betsy Ross flag big across the chest and these colors don't run. And that's the one that's selling out so quick. Don't worry.
[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:31.000]  It's so popular. I'm going to make a new limited edition after this. OK, and we'll have 10,000 of those. You're like, well, that'll be a lot of money. Yeah, it takes a ton more.
[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:44.000]  We have sold 100,000 t shirts before of Hillary for prison. And that helped fund a lot of stuff, but we sold half of them at cost. So we need the funding in four store dot com. Carpe Don's was amazing. Just was inside the White House.
[01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:51.000]  He'll be OK till 10 after or so for the rest of the hour with us. He understands Tommy's a political president facing certain death. They've pledged to do it.
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:59.000]  And so he'll be good. I don't want you to go through the rest of your breakdown of the evidence of the false charges against you and the total proof Tommy Robinson.
[01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:08.000]  Alex, first of all, what you were saying, you actually financially contributed to some of the equipment we would have been using on the day for this case.
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:19.000]  So thank you. And also, you know, I'm reaching out to the United States. There's been an organization in the United States, the Middle East Forum, who have also funded our fight for free speech in the UK.
[01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:33.000]  They've funded and tried to fight and have me released and continue to fight my legal battles with me. So thank you to them. I know so many Americans step forward when they see our freedoms are disappearing and our people are under attack.
[01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:52.000]  I want to address the final charge, the breach in the Section 4-2 report and restriction. Previously, I was ignorant to the rules around reporting restrictions and rules around court. I'm a citizen journalist. I hadn't studied. I hadn't been to university. So I began to learn and I paid privately to go to one of London's leading law firms, Kingsley Napoli.
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:53:08.000]  I went for training on contempt of court for training on reporting restrictions. I went, I learned, I downloaded and read the judiciary's own paper. It's called the reporting restrictions in the criminal courts. It's available to download on the judiciary's own website, their website.
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:23.000]  In fact, the Lord Chief Justice himself, the lead of our courts, he introduces this report stating that it's a practical guide for judges and the media on the statutory and common law principles which should be applied with regards to reporting restrictions.
[01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:33.000]  All you have to do is go on Google, put in reporting restrictions, criminal courts, you'll find it as the top link. Now, let me read for you what it says.
[01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:45.000]  Now, any reporting restriction imposes potential criminal liability on media organizations, journalists or editors who breach it. If a breach occurs, media organizations and their employees may face unlimited fines.
[01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:58.000]  Don't mention a prison. For these reasons, it is essential that any reporting restriction should be reduced to writing as soon as possible. It should be clear and precise and in terms and drawn up as a court order as soon as practical.
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:14.000]  As soon as practical. Once orders have been made, they should be drawn to the attention of the media by being shown on the court list and on the door of the court and wherever possible, sent to relevant local or national media organizations.
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:23.000]  Court staff should respond positively to media organizations request for assistance in relation to the existence of terms of a reporting restriction.
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:39.000]  Now, let me show you the court listings from the day before I went to court that day. Clearly, this is the court listings from the day before.
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:49.000]  As you can see from the online court listing the day before, they mentioned that the jury had retired, but crucially, there's no mention of any reporting restrictions in place.
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:56.000]  Clearly, it's not there. This is a screenshot that I took, but we were researching for this case.
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:04.000]  Now, of course, this led me to think the trial had finished. The jury's retired. Maybe the strict restrictions have been lifted.
[01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:12.000]  When I turned up to court that morning, I went into court. I asked a member of staff if there was still a reporting restriction on this case.
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:19.000]  The prosecution's own witness confirmed this in court. He told me he didn't know of any reporting restriction on the case.
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:26.000]  He did not provide me with the details as he is required to do by the judiciary's own guidelines.
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:37.000]  Now, my cameraman also went into court and took a picture of the screen. He looked at the court door, both of which had no notification of any reporting restriction.
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:44.000]  The attorney general read my statement because with a civil case, I had to give my statement three or four weeks prior to court.
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:50.000]  I told them you didn't have reporting restrictions on the screen. On the door, you had no reporting restrictions anywhere visible.
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:57.000]  Because of that, the attorney general got a statement trying to disprove me by interviewing the manager of Leeds Crown Court.
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:02.000]  Unfortunately for the prosecution, she actually confirmed everything I said.
[01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:07.000]  In her own words, they had failed to adhere to the legal guidelines.
[01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:15.000]  In fact, the details of the reporting restrictions were never ever once loaded onto the court system during the entirety of the six-week trial.
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:24.000]  Now, let me show you this. This is the law commission, the British Law Commission.
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:31.000]  So the attorney general in 2014 asked the law commission to do an investigation into contempt of court.
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:41.000]  So it is now standard practice that any reporting restriction is shown on the Crown Court list under the name and the relevant case.
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:46.000]  Allowing a ready means of checking whether there are such restrictions in place.
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:50.000]  Now, I've just showed you. It wasn't on there. I've showed you.
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:57:07.000]  In March 2014, the law commission recommended that there should be a single publicly of accessible website enabling the media and members of the public to find out if an order has been made under section 42 of the contempt of court Act 1981.
[01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:17.000]  This website should include a restricted area where for a charge certain users could find out the details of the reporting restriction and could sign up for automated alerts of new orders.
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:21.000]  At the time of writing this, this website has not been established.
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000]  Tommy, stay there. Tommy, stay there.
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:28.000]  The point is, is the reporting restrictions are on things like a trial about nuclear weapons or national security.
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:34.000]  But they didn't even have one for this child molester thing they're trying to protect, which you've been proven right. You're the hero.
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000]  And so they just make it up.
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:40.000]  Another reason they're throwing you in prison is saying you violated a restriction that didn't exist.
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:43.000]  The truth is, you're a political prisoner about to be sent back to solitary confinement.
[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:47.000]  You need to be evacuated to the United States with your family. Well, they're right back.
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:51.000]  The globalists are hyper competitive scientific dictators.
[01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:54.000]  They are technocrats. They are control freaks in their own words.
[01:57:54.000 --> 01:58:02.000]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:06.000]  We're fighting them hard in cyberspace. We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:13.000]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:18.000]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from ForrestLife.com, I couldn't do it.
[01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:28.000]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality medical bottleman and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:34.000]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over the counter that you're going to find anywhere.
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:47.000]  It is amazing. Experience pure medical bottleman B12 for yourself and fund the second American evolution against the tyrants at infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com, or AAA 253-3139.
[01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:17.000]  That's it. I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency. It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him. It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:23.000]  I agree entirely. And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:28.000]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old. I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:37.000]  But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war, you've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:46.000]  We're going to keep fighting in the info war. And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:58.000]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:16.000]  Carpe Duncan's coming up. Fresh off his White House visit. First look at what's coming up at the Big Summit on memes, war and social media this Thursday at the White House.
[02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:26.000]  And I know, well, more than 10 people that are going to be at the conference, they're going to break a ways with the president.
[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:32.000]  Carpe has already been some in there for a long 20 minute meeting with the president. I'll show you some of those photos of more.
[02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:38.000]  But a lot of interesting things to talk about some on record, some off record, but a lot of interesting things are happening.
[02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:43.000]  You know, I physically get not not not even angry, but vicious.
[02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:50.000]  Just really focused when I hear about things like this, because I know Tommy's telling the whole truth. He's got all the proof.
[02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:56.000]  I've lived through this. I've already gone through some of the things he's gone through. Nothing is bad. But I understand I'm going down that same road.
[02:00:56.000 --> 02:01:01.000]  That's what empathy is. You know, when you see a squirrel run over, it's a squirrel. You still feel bad.
[02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:05.000]  Boy, I bet having its back broke really, you know, really hurts.
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:17.000]  Hope it dies quickly. Well, what about watching a journalist who's a hero who exposed giant child kidnapping rings and they're busting thousands of these men sitting in the prison and the government is so pissed about it.
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:23.000]  That they want to put Tommy Robinson in prison. They already put him in there for a year, then three months of solitary.
[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:29.000]  The collaboration of the people in the British government in the UK government is astounding.
[02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:34.000]  We got a few minutes of this segment, a little bit more time than Carpe's coming on, but you're going through your evidence here.
[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:41.000]  And I think everybody understands no, no reporting restrictions. They still convicted you of that. It's just total criminal fraud.
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:46.000]  And as you said, it's because the UK is so compromised. Go ahead.
[02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:51.000]  The Contempt to Court Law is out of date. It was set before the invention of the Internet.
[02:01:51.000 --> 02:02:03.000]  The high degree of confusion around the guidelines to reporting restrictions led the Law Commission to conduct a six month review and a recommendation paper in 2014 specifically about Contempt to Court.
[02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:11.000]  The Law Commission found that the rules and guidelines are extremely confusing and could lead to a journey list mistakenly landed in Contempt to Court.
[02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:21.000]  Their sole recommendation, their one recommendation from their six month review of the government was to create one national website that all the details for trials with reporting restrictions are placed.
[02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:27.000]  That would allow the media, it would allow journalists, members of the public, access. So if I wanted to go up to a court case, I'd go on one national website.
[02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:33.000]  Tommy, Tommy, stop right there. Listen, we all know they abuse the Contempt to Court rule. They use it to protect pedophiles.
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:36.000]  That's been all over mainstream news. Everybody gets that at the White House.
[02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:41.000]  I want you to get into some of the other things and the reason you need to be brought because obviously you're a journalist.
[02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:46.000]  They're kangarooing you. You don't get a jury trial. You're a national hero. We need you here.
[02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:50.000]  Hell, if you get to the U.S., you can have a show right here. We'll get you a work visa.
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:54.000]  I know because of your prior convictions of the other fake stuff for journalism.
[02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000]  It's even hard for you to get a visa to the U.S.
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:00.000]  Well, hell, the liberals do it. We'll just march your ass across the Rio Grande.
[02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:06.000]  I bet the board patrol turned a blind eye. And we'll just bring you and your family. You just swim the river, brother.
[02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:14.000]  We'll just drive over in my RV. I'll pick your ass up because seriously, I mean, we got all these people flooding in by the millions that aren't real political dissidents.
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:22.000]  And then you're a real political dissident. And I just, we need, you need to file for asylum now and bring this up in court as well.
[02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:27.000]  And just say, listen, you can have the country. Islam's got it. Bye-bye. And just, just let them know you want to leave.
[02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:38.000]  But see, they want to kill your ass. But see, that takes their plumb away because, because if you make a big political issue as you are now, they won't have their big victory.
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:49.000]  Alex, the whole, the whole reason for all of this is a cover-up. The whole reason is not well in the public to realize that, for example, that law commission and giving them a, it's simple.
[02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:55.000]  It's very sensible and it's extremely easy to implement one website. Why won't they produce one website so journalists can go on?
[02:03:55.000 --> 02:04:06.000]  Because if they did, anyone could go on and they would see the amount of secret trials of Muslim rape gangs in every single town and city's court across our entire way for this country.
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:17.000]  The public would then realize just how many of these cases there are because every single one of these cases now is given a reporting restriction preventing anyone talking about.
[02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:30.000]  That's the reality of what it, what it is. So that, that is exactly why I know I've come 34 seconds. That is why they haven't implemented that. This, this was their sole recommendation from a report by the law commission for the attorney general.
[02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:37.000]  That's right. So stay there. You've got three contempt of court. You've already hit two and other frauds. Hit the final one briefly and then a summation.
[02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:50.000]  As you just said, your crime is exposing the giant industrial level, what they'd have hundreds of trials, hundreds of convictions, thousands sent to prison off of what you first exposed 11, 12 years ago.
[02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:56.000]  You have exposed, just like all this stuff in our news, the pedophiles.
[02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:11.000]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world. So the Infowars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another.
[02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:26.000]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale, of this public reach. It is the one model that says, here's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining, self-structured, little de-democratic structure that because the audience determines what content goes up,
[02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:41.000]  the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices and supporting Infowars. And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate-driven model and the ability to do that
[02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:56.000]  and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold. And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:26.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:43.000]  Garpe dunked him, one of the top memebers, if not the top memeber in the world. Many of his videos are going to be 50 million views. He'll be joining us for the last 45 minutes of this hour. Then Gerald Saliente takes over. Tommy Robinson hasn't gotten through half of what he wants to hit, the proof of the fraud, the lies.
[02:06:43.000 --> 02:07:00.000]  You already know it. You've seen the videos. The guy's a hero. He's facing prison again. Three counts. Just on one count of contempt earlier, he was in three months in solitary confinement. He appealed and got out on that. Now they're talking about throwing him in jail for years.
[02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:14.000]  This is incredible, ladies and gentlemen, so dangerous. You just heard the Democratic Congresswoman and others saying arrest conservatives that even criticize herself or AOC. AOC warned Donald Trump Jr. I've got subpoena power will arrest you.
[02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:24.000]  She doesn't even understand that the legislative doesn't have that power. These people are dangerous. Tommy Robinson in summation run through the rest of this information.
[02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:31.000]  Those people that are dangerous are in power in Britain. They're in power everywhere in Britain.
[02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:43.000]  Now, even in the Attorney General's skeleton argument against me, this is how laughable this entire case is. In their own skeleton committal proceedings against me, it referenced the president from 1997.
[02:07:43.000 --> 02:08:01.000]  It was a case of reporting restrictions against a newspaper published in a PLC where it has decided, and I quote, yeah, no one should be in peril of suffering a criminal penalty for contempt unless the order which he is said to have infringed is clear.
[02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:17.000]  Okay, we've got evidence. It wasn't anywhere. There was no talk of an order. The crucial point is that all of this is irrelevant. The prosecutor just used all of these things in court as distraction tactics because I did not even breach the report in order on that day.
[02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:31.000]  Even all the rules and regulations, yeah, the fact that the trial would come to an end, the failure of the court to notify the public of the existence of an order, I thought it weren't in place. Given how much the government have it in for me.
[02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:39.000]  I decided I was still not risk breaching it during my training and my studying for contempt of court and looking at the judiciary's own guide.
[02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:54.000]  This is a guy that's issued for judges in the media and reporting restrictions. It mentioned one critical point and I followed that critical point to the letter. The crucial bit of evidence, the crucial piece is that on the judiciary's own website,
[02:08:54.000 --> 02:09:10.000]  it states courts have no power under Section 42 to prevent publication of material that is already in the public domain. Now this guide that I'm reading was approved by the Lord Chief Justice himself.
[02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:25.000]  Let me be clear, you went and you read a BBC headline in front of a court that had dozens of reporters out there and then they've arrested you and put you in prison once for doing that, just like Roger Stone's facing a jail before his kangaroo trial on Russia
[02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:41.000]  for linking the news articles on his Instagram feed. And our own law is the same, it comes out of British common law. It says if there's a reporting restriction or there's a gag that doesn't gag you from restating what's already public or reading a record,
[02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:50.000]  it just means you can't yourself as a party say something about what's happening in the proceedings. So again, this is all total fraud by the court, continue.
[02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:59.000]  It's there. I simply everything I said that day was in the public domain. Now this is on the judiciary's own website. It's approved by the Lord Chief Justice.
[02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:09.000]  I referenced this several times in my live stream that day. I stated clearly that if you watch the hour long live stream, I was only referencing information already in the public domain.
[02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:20.000]  And they failed to make any clear detail of notifications of any report restriction in this case. According to legal legal president, that would mean they cannot hold me criminal, criminally liable.
[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:21.000]  Crucially, I followed.
[02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:31.000]  Sure. And they give men three months sentences for raping over 50 girls and beating them and torturing them. We understand your government's super evil right now. Get to the third charge and then the summation.
[02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:39.000]  Oh, unbelievably, Alex, you know what they said? When I quoted that everything I said was in the public domain, they said this information on their website was wrong.
[02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:43.000]  They said that's wrong. And when they say that's wrong, on the opening page of these.
[02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:51.000]  Well, you're reading the law and the rulings and the guidance on the law by the head court, by the Supreme Court, and they're saying that's wrong.
[02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000]  I get it. It's total judicial arrogance.
[02:10:53.000 --> 02:11:02.000]  And this sounds unbelievable, which is why I'm begging President Trump and your administration. Please look at this case. They said it's wrong.
[02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:07.000]  They said, no, that's not the law. That's wrong. It's been on their website for five years. Let me just read this one bit.
[02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:13.000]  This guide is now in its third edition. This is from the right honorable Lord Chief Justice.
[02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:23.000]  I warmly thank Guy Vassal of Matrix Chambers for his work in revising this guidance to ensure it's legal accuracy. It's legal accuracy.
[02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:27.000]  They said it's wrong. Their case against me was that what I went on there.
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:34.000]  Let's be clear. The same guy trying to put you in prison said that that is the letter of the law and certified it as the law.
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:44.000]  Well, the Lord Chief Justice, this is the previous Lord Chief Justice, but the court, the prosecutor for the Attorney General's government just said that's wrong. That's not the law.
[02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:52.000]  Now, I knew when I was defending my case here, it's clear the prosecution was determined to open a massive legal net no matter what.
[02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:58.000]  It's become apparent the prosecutor for the Attorney General, Andrew Coldy Cook. That was his name, yeah?
[02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:09.000]  He said he was at court then again. So that's set on their website, on their website, which they then say is not accurate.
[02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:13.000]  And that is the guidelines for a journalist to go on.
[02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:20.000]  Now, last year, Leeds Crown Court broke every single legal procedure possible. They refused me my own legal representation.
[02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:26.000]  They didn't even tell me what I was accused of doing. They didn't ask me to plead guilty or not guilty. They didn't even let me speak.
[02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:31.000]  I was sent into 13 months in prison in a 10 minute trial, something you'd imagine being held in North Korea.
[02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:36.000]  It was rightly thrown out on my appeal after I spent three months in solitary confinement.
[02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:42.000]  Judge Marston decided that day that I needed to be immediately removed from the streets and sent to prison within minutes.
[02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:51.000]  The Muslim child rapist with 16 witness statements detailing the rape and torture of children, he deemed they were no risk to the British public.
[02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:59.000]  He provided them with bail so they could continue to walk the streets alongside our children. Okay? Alongside our children.
[02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:07.000]  Now, one of these men decided to do a run. He'd done a run a week before the case finished. He's still hiding in Pakistan.
[02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:13.000]  That dangerous child rapist monster was on the run for months before reporting restrictions were lifted.
[02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:21.000]  Because of these criminal, these reporting restrictions, we had a paedophile rapist on the run and no one could even talk about it.
[02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:26.000]  Our media couldn't warn people. They couldn't even challenge for his whereabouts.
[02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:31.000]  The government's number one priority, first and foremost, should be to ensure the safety of the British people.
[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:35.000]  Exactly what your president, or exactly what President Trump is doing for America.
[02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:41.000]  The needs to suppress the scale of these gang rapes across my country trumps everything.
[02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:48.000]  This scumbag rapist is still walking the streets now. He's evaded justice thanks to Judge Marston.
[02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:53.000]  Do you know in over 60 years, no one has ever been in prison for a publication reporting breach? No one.
[02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:59.000]  The judiciary reporting restriction guideline, which is on their website, doesn't even mention prison.
[02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:02.000]  It just mentions a reference of a possibility of unlimited fines.
[02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:10.000]  Can I just show you and your audience and show the public some previous high profile cases so you can get the context on what's happening to me?
[02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:18.000]  Rod Liddle. Rod Liddle was a journalist. He nearly collapsed the Stephen Lawrence murder trial by detailing the defendant's previous criminal record.
[02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:25.000]  He risked collapsing the murder trial. He wasn't even prosecuted. The magazine he wrote for got a £3,000 fine.
[02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:31.000]  Journalists at the Daily Mail and the Daily Mirror, they published this prejudicial information on the Levi Bellifield murder trial.
[02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:37.000]  It was so prejudiced that it collapsed the entire case. The jury had to be discharged.
[02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:42.000]  Tommy, Tommy, here's what's happening. Here's what's happening. I've got carpet dunked him on. This is incredibly important.
[02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:49.000]  You've still got 10 pages of evidence here ready. And it's critical as people understand how the police state works.
[02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:54.000]  What you're saying is, even if you did these things, even if it was true, the law is still wrong, but you didn't do what they say.
[02:14:54.000 --> 02:15:02.000]  So they're lying, which is really criminal. And you've got the point that they've never given somebody sentences 30 months in jail, a year in jail,
[02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:07.000]  three months solitary, like they are, and you need to get out of there and you say London and England has fallen.
[02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:13.000]  And I agree. And I think we need to admit it's been fallen. How do I explain fell to Islam? We can have a little reconquista,
[02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:20.000]  but we can't have the reconquering of Wales and Scotland and Ireland until we admit all of these problems.
[02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:24.000]  So why don't you, I know you're very busy, but then we're going to get all this together.
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:30.000]  I want your full statement. People go to the White House. Why don't you cool your heels for 45 minutes?
[02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:35.000]  Donald Duckham's got huge news as well from inside the White House and just have dinner or something.
[02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:38.000]  I know it's late. And then come back for a couple of segments.
[02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:43.000]  Jill Solentia, I understand in 45 minutes and finish up and we'll splice it all together and put it out. How's that sound?
[02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:53.000]  Yeah, that sounds cool. Yeah, yeah. It's a great defense you're putting on. You went on record before you go into this rat hole prison.
[02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.000]  I understand, brother. You're awesome.
[02:15:55.000 --> 02:16:02.000]  Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:05.000]  Forget bunkers. You're not a live underground gopher.

[02:17:56.000 --> 02:18:04.000]  Well, we're very, very clear with everybody about all of this. We're going into the season of war and they have been inches from shutting down the final mega accounts we have.
[02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:11.000]  Do their criminal activity and their digital fraud and we need to know that we've got capital to go six months a year. We need to end here.
[02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:17.000]  We need to be provisioned and you've got my total commitment that I am going to rampage forward against the enemy fearlessly.
[02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:28.000]  I'm loving every minute of this because I know I'm getting under their skin. I'm bloody and then I'm up politically. I'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies and that just brings more people here.
[02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:34.000]  So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you and I need war bonds. I need gas. I need ammo politically now.
[02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:41.000]  But literally if you flood us with money and if you flood us with product purchases and if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable. We're unstoppable together.
[02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:50.000]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy. I want to raise a couple million dollars right now to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing and that you will stand with us and I will never back down.
[02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:56.000]  You have my commitment. This only gives me more energy and more understanding of what we're facing and that we were right about this.
[02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000]  Robert Barnes, what does Big Tech become?
[02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:07.000]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies and the way they did so is because they face no consequence of social, economic, political or legal for their illicit activities over two decades.
[02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:19.000]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this have to bring real social, political, economic consequence to their course of conduct.
[02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:30.000]  Otherwise they will never change and they will become the Big Tech Golo Garks, the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century who ran American politics and ran American economy almost into the ground until we were able to recover after the Great Depression.
[02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:41.000]  The informer's audience is the fuel that flames the light of liberty across the world to make real the actions of independent free speech, to make real the original promise of an independent free press.
[02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:48.000]  Real collusion is Big Tech and Big Media manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle with elections, to try to shake people's thoughts.
[02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:51.000]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening.
[02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:56.000]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting. What you just saw isn't what you just saw. Even it is what you just saw.
[02:19:56.000 --> 02:20:02.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:15.000]  You found it. The tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones show.
[02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:17.000]  I hear people.
[02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:25.000]  Senator Warren, I want to start with you. We are less than 50 miles from Parkland, Florida where 17 people were killed in a school shelter.
[02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:31.000]  What's happening?
[02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:36.000]  We are going to take a quick break. We're going to get this technical situation.
[02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000]  What's happening?
[02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:48.000]  We are hearing our colleagues' audio.
[02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:51.000]  It's a control room.
[02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:58.000]  We're going to turn off the lights.
[02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:01.000]  We've prepared for everything.
[02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:11.000]  We are going to take a quick break.
[02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:21.000]  And so many other great meme makers, great artists, great communicators this Thursday are going to be in DC for the summit that's being called a social media summit.
[02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:24.000]  What it really is is a meme summit.
[02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:28.000]  And President Trump is deciding how he's going to take action against Big Tech.
[02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:31.000]  We met with the head of Twitter a few months ago.
[02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000]  I happened to just be in DC when it was going on.
[02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000]  Nobody told me to be there.
[02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000]  And I just happened to bullhorn while he was inside.
[02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:44.000]  And now the president has come out and said that Jack Dorsey basically lied to him and is engaged in criminal election meddling.
[02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:47.000]  McCarpe Donkton will show you some photos he sent us.
[02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:52.000]  Well, he got in contact and was able to go meet with the president for 20 minutes.
[02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:58.000]  Also with his children, he was nice to bring one of his other meme buddies along with him.
[02:21:58.000 --> 02:21:59.000]  Very exciting.
[02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:04.000]  He'll be driving back to DC here in just the next day or so to meet with President Trump again.
[02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:07.000]  A lot of people are calling me saying what's going to happen at this summit.
[02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:11.000]  I've talked to more than more than 10 people now that have gotten the invite.
[02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:16.000]  I'm not but but hurt that I was not invited because this isn't about journalists or broadcasters.
[02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:22.000]  This is about meme makers is really who's being invited like like like Ben Garrison,
[02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:27.000]  who's undoubtedly the most prolific and popular political cartoonist in the world right now.
[02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000]  Billions of views of his stuff.
[02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.000]  Poor guy could barely make a living.
[02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:32.000]  That's how the world works.
[02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:36.000]  But but but but his cache in culture wars is unlimited.
[02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000]  Now they're calling him an anti-Semite.
[02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:42.000]  So a lot of folks they got invited told me just please don't say we're invited.
[02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000]  We don't want to be attacked.
[02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000]  There's a particularly prominent person.
[02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:47.000]  There's a frequent guest here.
[02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:48.000]  So don't worry.
[02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000]  We've got plenty of representation inside.
[02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:55.000]  But the good news is Trump has told a lot of people I've talked to not Carpe Dongtum,
[02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:58.000]  but others that he is planning to take action.
[02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:01.000]  He's just trying to get the Justice Department to move with antitrust and more.
[02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:07.000]  So Carpe Dongtum joins us during this critical time because if we take action against big tech censorship,
[02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:12.000]  we can win the next election and set this country back on the right path to success.
[02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:15.000]  I don't want to get into too much about what we talked about the president,
[02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:18.000]  different angles of this, what you think is coming up this Thursday.
[02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000]  But you just start wherever you want.
[02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:24.000]  My friend and thank you for joining us Carpe Dongtum on Twitter.
[02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000]  Carpe Dongtum on YouTube.
[02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:29.000]  Carpe Dongtum and the great part about you being under the president's wing.
[02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:30.000]  They've been trying to get you removed.
[02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000]  CNN has been trying to dox you.
[02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000]  They haven't been successful yet.
[02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000]  And we'll just leave it at that.
[02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000]  But this is definitely we laugh about it.
[02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000]  This is definitely a war.
[02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000]  You know, I'll just get this out of the right way.
[02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:49.000]  And I'm wearing a hat that was in the Oval Office and given to me by President Trump.
[02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000]  But I'm going to take it off because I look dumb.
[02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:52.000]  You look good.
[02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:56.000]  Leave it on.
[02:23:56.000 --> 02:24:00.000]  So it's absolutely a war.
[02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:06.000]  2020, they're going to try and silence anyone who's effective.
[02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:09.000]  They're going to try and shut them down, get them off the Internet,
[02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.000]  make sure that the message doesn't go out.
[02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:15.000]  Big Tech is going to continue to ramp up.
[02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:22.000]  We've already seen increased bans for highly public figures.
[02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:27.000]  We've seen demonetization for people like Crowder and others.
[02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:38.000]  We're already seeing people like, you know, kind of centrist like Dave Rubin being like Shadow Band on YouTube or on Twitter.
[02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:48.000]  They're just going to keep ramping up until they've tightened the news so much that no information can get out.
[02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:53.000]  And they've even listed mainline liberals that are popular saying they're right wing leaders too.
[02:24:53.000 --> 02:25:02.000]  It seems like anybody that hasn't taken a deal with YouTube or Google or Facebook or Twitter to be under their control is like Philip DeFranco.
[02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000]  They called him the right wing leader.
[02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:08.000]  Philip DeFranco is a liberal that attacks me on a routine basis.
[02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000]  Yeah, it's very funny.
[02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:21.000]  I think you're starting to get a little bit of feedback from some of these liberals that are saying, hey, wait a minute, I'm with you guys.
[02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:28.000]  I said this one thing over here that wasn't quite in line with the party lockstep,
[02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:38.000]  but I'm a liberal like you and they're like, no, you can't talk like that, otherwise you're all right or you're affiliated with this pro-trump movement.
[02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:51.000]  And, you know, the classic liberal is a unicorn and they're super hard to find because they get squashed every time they say anything rational.
[02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:59.000]  There's no longer room in the platform or the Democratic platform for rational thought.
[02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000]  And by the way, we're not just saying that.
[02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000]  I mean, I've become punch-drunk.
[02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:10.000]  They're actually winning in some respects where I see articles every day out of Germany, Sweden, Austria, even Italy's got a better leader,
[02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:15.000]  but still the courts are corrupt where like someone criticizes, there's 500 migrants in our town of 100.
[02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:16.000]  They raped my daughter today.
[02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000]  Boom, you're arrested.
[02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:28.000]  I mean, there is such a Tommy Robinson is facing years in prison for simply standing outside a courthouse when convicted pedophiles walk by and say,
[02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:29.000]  what do you think of your conviction?
[02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000]  Which is totally, I mean, totally legal.
[02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:32.000]  This is a war.
[02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:37.000]  We have Democrats from AOC to all these other idiots saying arrest people that criticize them.
[02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000]  I mean, these are real authoritarians.
[02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.000]  This is really happening.
[02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:42.000]  Right.
[02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:43.000]  That was just a couple of days ago.
[02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:49.000]  I forget who it was that they were saying that we should shut down anybody that makes fun of us on the Internet.
[02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:53.000]  Wasn't that a representative or a senator that said that?
[02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:54.000]  Yeah.
[02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000]  It's Congresswoman Wilson from Florida.
[02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:57.000]  Right.
[02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:58.000]  And that's, that's insane.
[02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:08.000]  The state, the state of big tech in the state of the Democratic Party is moving just further and further out.
[02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:14.000]  I mean, she's a crazed muppet and then every time she gets criticized, she goes, I'm a lesbian.
[02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:15.000]  Don't criticize me.
[02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:16.000]  Lady, I don't give a flying.
[02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.000]  What were you, what you're doing?
[02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:21.000]  The point is keep your damn hands off my freedom.
[02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000]  You're a damn witch clown.
[02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:24.000]  Go to hell.
[02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:25.000]  I got my rights.
[02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000]  A lot of people died for that lady.
[02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:28.000]  Millions.
[02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:31.000]  I mean, there's just, I mean, all my camera crew is so freaked out about the Tommy Robinson thing.
[02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:32.000]  You can all watch the video.
[02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000]  He's outside politely asking people.
[02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000]  The press is allowed to do that in the UK.
[02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:37.000]  So they are here.
[02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000]  And then they've put him here and put him in prison.
[02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:42.000]  I mean, we're all in danger, brother.
[02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:48.000]  I thought, so that happened what, like nine months ago, that was, I thought that was insane.
[02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:54.000]  Just, just on the surface that he got put in jail for filming outside.
[02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:55.000]  30 months.
[02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000]  He spent three months in solitary.
[02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:58.000]  Congressman made a big deal.
[02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000]  They let him out on appeal.
[02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:01.000]  Right.
[02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000]  He was convicted by a judge in five minutes.
[02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:04.000]  No trial.
[02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:09.000]  Do you, do you also remember, I believe he got arrested at Speaker's Corner?
[02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:10.000]  Yes.
[02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000]  Where you're supposed to be able to say whatever you want.
[02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000]  And he got arrested over there.
[02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:15.000]  They wouldn't let him speak.
[02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:20.000]  God, look what he, look what he came out of the jail for almost 40 pounds lighter.
[02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:28.000]  It's, what is happening in, in Europe and what is happening, you know, well, this is in Europe,
[02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:35.000]  but Germany, places like that is, it's what they want to have happen here.
[02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:36.000]  That's right.
[02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:37.000]  Stay there.
[02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:38.000]  You're going to have the floor when we come back.
[02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000]  And that's why we're fighting hard, folks.
[02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:43.000]  Tommy Robinson is a real man.
[02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:47.000]  I don't care about Hollywood stars, basketball players, you know, but let me tell you something.
[02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:48.000]  Do you like Tommy Robinson?
[02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000]  Are you out there supporting us?
[02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000]  That's, that's, let me tell you, they're going to probably kill him this time.
[02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:53.000]  They said they're going to kill him.
[02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000]  He's ready to die.
[02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:59.000]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000]  I had a problem like you once.
[02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:10.000]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:15.000]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:20.000]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:23.000]  you need to call the national treatment advisors.
[02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:28.000]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits
[02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000]  and totally change your life.
[02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:35.000]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:38.000]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse.
[02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:39.000]  Get clean.
[02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:57.000]  Call now and learn more.
[02:29:57.000 --> 02:30:00.000]  I talk about this on the air and I know it sinks into people,
[02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:03.000]  but I've decided that we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements
[02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:06.000]  in that if you go back five, six years ago before all the censorship and attacks
[02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000]  and fake lawsuits and the rest of it,
[02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:11.000]  you'll know about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were.
[02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:14.000]  And I'd have doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good.
[02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:17.000]  And instead the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us.
[02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:18.000]  Or they'll shut us down.
[02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are
[02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:21.000]  and how wonderful they were.
[02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.000]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:26.000]  Jones sells unapproved supplements.
[02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:27.000]  He claims they're supplements.
[02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:30.000]  No, under federal law since 1996,
[02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:33.000]  you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA
[02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:35.000]  because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:38.000]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them.
[02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:41.000]  And all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature
[02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.000]  and manipulate it and do different things.
[02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:44.000]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.000]  They have side effects, not with Mother Nature,
[02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:49.000]  but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest.
[02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:55.000]  InfowarsStore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.

[02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000]  crossed a cotton,
[02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000]  harness science,
[02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:08.000]  took to the skies and soared into the heavens
[02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:12.000]  because we will never forget that we are Americans
[02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:15.000]  and the future belongs to us.
[02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:22.000]  The future belongs to the brave, the strong, the proud and the free.
[02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:29.000]  We are one people chasing one dream and one magnificent destiny.
[02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:35.000]  We all share the same heroes, the same home, the same heart
[02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:40.000]  and we are all made by the same Almighty God.
[02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:46.000]  Infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.

[02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:50.000]  Full power!
[02:32:50.000 --> 02:33:11.000]  Damn the torpedoes, go straight at them!
[02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:28.000]  It's illusion, for every moment of truth there's confusion in life.
[02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:33.000]  Love can be seen as the answer,
[02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:38.000]  but nobody breathes for the dancer.
[02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:45.000]  And it's only love, only love, only love.
[02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:51.000]  Carpe dunked him as our guest, currently the dominant mean maker on the planet.
[02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:54.000]  He works to not have his name put out because they're ever seeking
[02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000]  where he lives to attack his wife and children.
[02:33:56.000 --> 02:34:00.000]  That's how they operate, believe me, I've experienced it.
[02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:03.000]  Once they have their way, prison is what we face.
[02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:07.000]  We're not victims, we're targets because we're exposing the globalists.
[02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:10.000]  We're exposing their in-game plan, but we're fighting back
[02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:14.000]  and in Trump they see everything they hate.
[02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:17.000]  Carpe, you've got the floor here in the segment because I always run over folks
[02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:20.000]  and heard you on the other day and he's just as bad as I am about interrupting.
[02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000]  He's 11 to death, but you're a smart guy.
[02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:25.000]  I've got a lot of questions like talking to Trump for 20 minutes,
[02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:30.000]  what's the inside baseball, your take on what's coming up at this big summit
[02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000]  in just three days in DC that you're going to be at.
[02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:36.000]  You're pre-invited, nobody else I know is pre-invited.
[02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:40.000]  Trump has a special liking for you, so do I.
[02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:43.000]  What do you want to impart to this large audience?
[02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:49.000]  I almost feel bad talking about it.
[02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:53.000]  It was a big moment to go in there and meet Trump,
[02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:57.000]  but I almost feel bad making such a big deal about it.
[02:34:57.000 --> 02:35:02.000]  It is a big deal, but when there's so many other things going on...
[02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:08.000]  But he's recognizing that you've gotten billions of views and your art is powerful.
[02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:15.000]  I totally get that. I just feel like there's so much going on right now
[02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:20.000]  that it's hard for me to stop and kind of take it all in.
[02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:24.000]  But in the White House it was an amazing experience.
[02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:29.000]  I think that you asked about what the summit is going to be like.
[02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:33.000]  I don't know specifically, but I know it's in the East Wing.
[02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:36.000]  I think there's going to be a lot of people there.
[02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:41.000]  I feel like it's going to be just a venue
[02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:46.000]  where different influencers that have experienced censorship
[02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:51.000]  or are able to still speak out about censorship can get together,
[02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:57.000]  network together, and hopefully build relationships
[02:35:57.000 --> 02:36:05.000]  that can then be leveraged to kind of bring big tech back to heel.
[02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:10.000]  And I really hope that during the meeting
[02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:17.000]  that President Trump will speak out strongly against those that have been censored like you
[02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:21.000]  and removed from the public discussion
[02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:27.000]  and issue some sort of ultimatum that this needs to stop
[02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:33.000]  or we're going to have to go down some real serious avenues here of how to fix it.
[02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:36.000]  I hope that that's the statement that he makes.
[02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:39.000]  Whether or not that's the statement that will be at this meeting,
[02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:44.000]  I feel like this is going to be one of many future meetings,
[02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:52.000]  some maybe even more exclusive and possibly like boardroom style meetings
[02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:54.000]  where it's actually a listening session.
[02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000]  This doesn't really feel like a listening session.
[02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:59.000]  This feels more like we're going to get together.
[02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.000]  We're going to show some strength.
[02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:07.000]  We're going to get the right people in the right room and move forward.
[02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:13.000]  But I do hope that in the future there is a lot more of this type of stuff going on.
[02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.000]  I'll tell you what I'm thinking.
[02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:19.000]  Trump needs people like you on his staff to help produce memes for him directly
[02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:22.000]  that are from the president so they don't dare touch them
[02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:25.000]  and they have that imperial glow to them that we need.
[02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:28.000]  You're a smart cookie and there's a lot of inside baseball we can't get into,
[02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:31.000]  but I agree with your analysis and the fact that the president said obviously
[02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000]  he wants to meet with you some more.
[02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:37.000]  What that means is that Trump is preparing to kind of look at the army
[02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:40.000]  and figure out and talk to you guys about what should be done.
[02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:45.000]  There'll be breakaway meetings and it'll also be a test to see who talks about what,
[02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.000]  who's an operative.
[02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:50.000]  Trump's learned about infiltration.
[02:37:50.000 --> 02:38:01.000]  I've said this before, but there's a certain quality about the stuff that I do
[02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:04.000]  that could never be done in an official capacity.
[02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:07.000]  I can create things that can be shared around it.
[02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.000]  Maybe the president doesn't share it,
[02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:14.000]  but there are things that if I was working for the White House or...
[02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:16.000]  No, it'd be too much of a party.
[02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:18.000]  Probably an unofficial capacity, but yeah.
[02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:22.000]  There'd be 100 lawyers standing between me and the retweet button.
[02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:29.000]  So there is some good to not actually having official people inside the camp.
[02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:31.000]  Now I'm just saying, talking to you and interviewing you before,
[02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:34.000]  you're a smart cookie and this is the type of people Trump needs as real people
[02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:37.000]  that didn't come out of the swamp but came out of America.
[02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:38.000]  Right.
[02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:39.000]  I totally agree with that.
[02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:43.000]  I think he does have people around him.
[02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:50.000]  And I want to say that the media team is doing a fantastic job for Trump.
[02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:55.000]  Some of the videos that they've come out with in the last six months
[02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000]  have been just spot on.
[02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000]  Great music, great visuals.
[02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:05.000]  The Fourth of July video for the speech was very well done.
[02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000]  And that's the kind of stuff that they need to continue.
[02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000]  Now they don't do the memes so much.
[02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:12.000]  They don't add really the funny elements to it.
[02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:15.000]  Their serious work is really getting good.
[02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000]  No, you're absolutely right.
[02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000]  Dan Scavino's doing a great job.
[02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:20.000]  No, they certainly are.
[02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:23.000]  And that's why the system's getting mad because Trump's almost three years in.
[02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000]  He's finally getting some good people in.
[02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:26.000]  He's getting his sea legs.
[02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:27.000]  That's scaring the system.
[02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:30.000]  That's why they spend everything as if it's a disaster.
[02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:34.000]  They're like, oh, Trump 15 minutes called the attack off.
[02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:36.000]  The British ambassador says it's inept.
[02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:37.000]  No one's ever done that.
[02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:41.000]  During the Cuban Missile Crisis, Kennedy was hovering over the launch buttons.
[02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:45.000]  They'd already given the order to shoot the rudder off the Russian ship.
[02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:49.000]  But the Russians turned at the last minute and they called back.
[02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:50.000]  And then Kennedy killed the attack.
[02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:53.000]  They were shipping, you know, the nuclear missiles to Cuba.
[02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:59.000]  That happens constantly with a strike that is political all the time.
[02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000]  Most of the time presidents call stuff off.
[02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:02.000]  Here's an example.
[02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:03.000]  Cuban Missile Crisis.
[02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:06.000]  I don't know a long story, but they even had an NPR piece about it, which I'd already read before.
[02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:08.000]  I wouldn't just believe NPR.
[02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:14.000]  They were inserting green berets, which really just means you're willing to do suicide missions with cyanide pills.
[02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:17.000]  During the Cuban Missile Crisis, he'd be brought in by helicopter.
[02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:18.000]  They had to hike in 30, 40 miles.
[02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:19.000]  They'd get to the missile site.
[02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:25.000]  They'd sit on top of a water tower or whatever with a rifle that projected just a beam of light.
[02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000]  It wasn't lazing like infrared back then.
[02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:31.000]  And they'd have to, if somebody came up on patrol, they'd have to knife them to death or whatever.
[02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:32.000]  That happened.
[02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:33.000]  Right.
[02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:34.000]  A lot of times some of them did take cyanide.
[02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:35.000]  Quite a few died, I'm told.
[02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:36.000]  A lot of that's classified.
[02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:42.000]  But this one guy was telling a story on NPR about he would lay the target every night when the jets came over,
[02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:47.000]  just so the president had a target time to bomb it if he wanted to just blow up the launch site.
[02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:51.000]  So the idea that Trump's insane, he was, there were 15 minutes away from bombing,
[02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:56.000]  and no one's ever pulled off an attack, and no one's ever stopped an attack like that.
[02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:58.000]  That's pure horse crap.
[02:40:58.000 --> 02:40:59.000]  Right.
[02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:04.000]  Well, so I've talked to a few reporters since I got out of the White House there.
[02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:10.000]  And I've told them the story, one of the few stories that I will share from the White House,
[02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:16.000]  which is Trump turned to my kids and he said, he pointed to the little red button on his desk
[02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:18.000]  and he says, do you know what that button does?
[02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:20.000]  And they said, no.
[02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:23.000]  And he says, well, maybe we should press it and see what happens.
[02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:26.000]  Some people say that it launches the missiles.
[02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:28.000]  And so he goes over and presses it.
[02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:31.000]  And the kids are all excited about what's going to happen.
[02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:35.000]  And just one of the secret services says, I'm right here, Mr. President.
[02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.000]  And so, I mean, that's a funny story.
[02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:44.000]  But I can imagine that when anybody in the media that I've told that to gets that story,
[02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:49.000]  they're going to run with the headline of Trump plays with his secret service button on his desk.
[02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:53.000]  Or they'd say Trump scares children with launching nuclear war.
[02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:54.000]  Right, exactly.
[02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:58.000]  Trump jokes about nuclear war in the Oval Office.
[02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:02.000]  Those are the types of things that are just insane to think about.
[02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:06.000]  I mean, the sign behind me, the Trump forever sign.
[02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:09.000]  They're already spitting your memes that, oh, they wanted to be a dictator.
[02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:10.000]  Right.
[02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:12.000]  Like he's going to be president forever.
[02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:14.000]  He's 73.
[02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:19.000]  I had a reporter asking me, so do you think he's really going to be president forever?
[02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000]  And I said, are you insane?
[02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:22.000]  Like, what is wrong with you?
[02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:24.000]  On average, he'll be dead in two years.
[02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:26.000]  I mean, come on.
[02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:31.000]  Like, the left has completely lost any sort of humor.
[02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:34.000]  They have lost any sort of rational thought.
[02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:35.000]  It's just...
[02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:36.000]  Well, what they are is deceivers.
[02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:37.000]  Carpe, you're on fire.
[02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:40.000]  Well, I want to hear more about this because this will be big national news.
[02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:42.000]  Trump plays with a red button on his desk.
[02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:43.000]  Right.
[02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:47.000]  To make you read 20 paragraphs till you find out, Carpe Duncan is our guest, amazing individual.
[02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:55.000]  Aren't you being blessed to have him?
[02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:59.000]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:00.000]  They are technocrats.
[02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:02.000]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:09.000]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:11.000]  Now, we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:14.000]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:20.000]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:25.000]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4slife.com, I couldn't do it.
[02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:35.000]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality, Methylcobalamin, and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:41.000]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over the counter that you're going to find anywhere.
[02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:55.000]  It is amazing, experience pure Methylcobalamin B12 for yourself and fund the second American evolution against the tyrants at infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com, or triple A 253 3139.
[02:43:55.000 --> 02:44:01.000]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made, Alpha Power.

[02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:38.000]  I love the smell of liberal tears. Smells like victory. InfoWars smells like victory, doesn't it? Yeah, it smells like victory. Smells like America. That sweet smell.
[02:47:38.000 --> 02:48:00.000]  And the fallen ones hate it. We have the light and the power. They seek it. You should never have it. But humanity has been in the Odin's sleep. Now it's time to stop sleeping and awaken. Come out of the trance.
[02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:10.000]  Carpe Doctin, you've made some amazing points so far. Tommy Rhombus is going to come back because he didn't finish his statement before he goes into a black hole prison where I'm not exaggerating.
[02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:17.000]  They let the Muslims come to his food opening and poop in it and the police laugh. That's how it would let us run in the government what you live under.
[02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:30.000]  He's about to literally enter a, you know, what hole. We're praying for him. He's popping back on to finish what he said in Gero Salente. But just keep rolling with where you see the country going, where you see the world going.
[02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:39.000]  All these other great meme folks are in contact with on the Donald subreddit. Oh, that really woke Trump up from somebody else that talked to the president that he was really pissed.
[02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:49.000]  They froze the Donald or the Democrat debates as if, oh, let's protect our precious debates. This will defeat Trump. You have horrible candidates.
[02:48:49.000 --> 02:49:01.000]  Cory Booker always looks like he's giving birth to a 400 pound turd. He thinks it's like an earnest look. I mean, these are clowns. These are clowns we need to awaken.
[02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:07.000]  Alex, you're talking bad about Spartacus, man. You can't talk bad about Spartacus.
[02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:13.000]  That's what he said. I'm Spartacus. I'm releasing secret info, which wasn't secret info.
[02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:32.000]  Well, you mentioned the Donald and that's wasn't that nuts that on the day of the debates, they shut down the Donald, the place where all of the memes will be coming out for the debates, they shut it down that morning.
[02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:47.000]  As far as I know, it's still shut down. I mean, you can get to it, but you have to know the exact URL. You can't search for it. It won't show up in your subscriptions, but I mean, they've been messing with the Donald for a year and a half.
[02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:58.000]  And that's after Senator Wyden, who looks like a dead lizard. And of course, Senator Murphy says, I must be taken off the air to save democracy.
[02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:07.000]  He says he wants it banned in a public ask beginning and now they've they phantom zoned it, which is the next thing we do before they ban it.
[02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:13.000]  Again, that's incredible. That's a message board about the president. Trump must act on this. Sorry, I'm ranting.
[02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:31.000]  No, you're fine. It's it's a, you know, there there have been and I want to I want to give a shout out to the moderators of their of the of the Donald do a fantastic job because there's there's infiltrators all the time trying to post bad content on there that will get us in trouble and
[02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:33.000]  they're removing stuff all the time.
[02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:39.000]  Sure. The left admits they do. They go on there and say the most racist crap attributes us. It's like just a small stuff.
[02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:43.000]  Yeah, exactly. They're they're hoaxing on us all the time.
[02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:57.000]  You can look at the logs. Reddit itself has only had to remove I think two or three posts in the last month out of, you know, the quote unquote, like 700,000 800,000 people on there.
[02:50:57.000 --> 02:51:10.000]  It's more like 6 million. But out of all the things that are posted on there, Reddit has only had to step in like twice. And who knows what those things were. Anyway, if they were even something they should have stepped in on.
[02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:19.000]  But but exactly. But let's explain phantom zone where. So how do we find the Donald subreddit? Well, we should have the URL. You have to type it in my hand. Unsearchable.
[02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:22.000]  Again, phantom zoning. How do we find that?
[02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:31.000]  Well, you have to go to like www dot Reddit dot com slash r slash the Donald.
[02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:39.000]  Again, unsearchable that they've all worked in coordination. You've got to actually go to me. This is just it's incredible.
[02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:42.000]  Well, there's an underscore.
[02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:45.000]  Yeah, I think you guys pulled the wrong thing up. Yeah, it's an underscore.
[02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:54.000]  So it's so it's this incredible taxing thing. Yeah, but here's what's funny carpet on them. They thought, oh, our magic debates will be so good.
[02:51:54.000 --> 02:52:00.000]  We can't let Donald in them where the where the where the memes come from. We can't let them make fun of it.
[02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:07.000]  It was still a giant train wreck even because it's pathetic. No, no, no, you can't polish a turd.
[02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:20.000]  Yeah, see, there you go. There's the there's the quarantine that they put on the Donald, making sure you know that that there might be something that might upset you on the other side of that link.
[02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:36.000]  But yeah, you're right. It didn't it didn't matter because there was the debacle with all the technical issues and then the next night you had that crazy lady talking about crystals and power of love and all that kind of.
[02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:44.000]  And all the illegals and everything free and the other guy Castro saying, we need to have trans people be able to have abortions.
[02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:52.000]  Trans men. I was one of my best. That was one of my best tweets of the night was was being like, wait, what?
[02:52:52.000 --> 02:53:06.000]  Trans women deserve the right to abortion. How does that work exactly? But and Biden doing his little. That thing was hilarious. It was just it was a train wreck from beginning to end.
[02:53:06.000 --> 02:53:09.000]  Swallow being being out there on the stage.
[02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:13.000]  Swallows well is just not even pulling one.
[02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:17.000]  He's announcing today. I think he's I think he's leaving the race today.
[02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:22.000]  He's doing a press conference later. So I'll be sad to see him go though.
[02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:25.000]  Well, it's an incredible time to be alive.
[02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:30.000]  And just because they're still being devastated, it's look at him.
[02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:40.000]  It's very dangerous to now say, oh, one of the biggest message boards in the world with six million users, the Donald subreddit, you can't get to it.
[02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:42.000]  It's quarantine. It's bad.
[02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:48.000]  I think a message board you can't. I mean, Trump has to act on this.
[02:53:48.000 --> 02:53:53.000]  Well, you know, they they quarantined it because they can't ban it.
[02:53:53.000 --> 02:54:01.000]  If they if they ban it, it will create they know it will have the striking effect that if they ban it, it will just it will go crazy.
[02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:05.000]  You understand sending something into the Phantom Zone is the same thing.
[02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:09.000]  Well, we have an executing. He's in the Tower of London.
[02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:12.000]  It's it's that it's that in between zone.
[02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:19.000]  It's not quite the same as banning, but, you know, it's it's for the lawyers, basically, and it's for the PR people.
[02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:22.000]  They can be like, well, no, we're allowing them to be there. They're fine.
[02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:23.000]  They're just.
[02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:24.000]  Well, no, no.
[02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:29.000]  It's a Matt Rudd said almost four years ago in this in that room through the door over there.
[02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:34.000]  He said, Alex, first they put you in a digital ghetto.
[02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:39.000]  Right. Then make everybody forget about you, make you poor for a couple of years. Then they ship your ass to the death camp.
[02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:44.000]  I mean, so we're at the death camp at Info Wars, but people are fighting through, you know, whatever.
[02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:49.000]  But as for the Donald, doesn't it get it's been put into the digital ghetto?
[02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:52.000]  Absolutely. You can't.
[02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:55.000]  You watch Black Mirror.
[02:54:55.000 --> 02:55:03.000]  There's a lot of kind of social justice warrior stuff in there, but there was there was an episode where they had these little implants in their eyes and you could block people.
[02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:06.000]  And they would just fuzz them out so you couldn't see them anymore.
[02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:09.000]  That's what they're doing with different people on social media.
[02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:16.000]  They're still there. You just can't see them or interact with them. Everything's all garbled.
[02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:19.000]  Guys, try to pull up the Caitlyn Bennett article from last week.
[02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:26.000]  The headline was Instagram bans American flag because of Info Wars image.
[02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:33.000]  And it was her like eight, nine months ago in an Info Wars shirt with an American flag.
[02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:35.000]  Yeah, I heard about that. That's insane.
[02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:37.000]  And they blurted out and said, you do this again, you're banned.
[02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:42.000]  And that was, they said two months ago, no Alex Jones, but they're going back in time.
[02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:45.000]  Now they're like, oh, you know, you did this.
[02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:54.000]  Well, I guess I'm lucky then because I haven't been banned from, I've posted your stuff on Instagram and on Facebook and I've so far gotten away with it.
[02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:58.000]  But I guess look for, look for that in the future.
[02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:02.000]  Well, Carpe Duncan, they know the president's tweeted out a bunch of your stuff.
[02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:05.000]  They know the president likes you. They're scared of triggering him.
[02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:07.000]  And so that's what I'm trying to explain to you.
[02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:11.000]  The fact that, you know, you're having phone calls, 20 minute one on one conversations.
[02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:19.000]  By the way, you're great for, I'm not kissing your ass, but like the photos from the White House are like world, that's not, you know, time magazine is not that good.
[02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:25.000]  Like the kid playing with the airplane and Trump in the background, these are great photos.
[02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:29.000]  Well, I will tell you this from the conversation.
[02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:44.000]  When we walked in there, the White House photographer there was there and President Trump said, now that is the most highly paid photographer in the entire world and completely worth it.
[02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:46.000]  So we got great, great photos.
[02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:48.000]  Oh, so that wasn't you. That was the White House photographer.
[02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:49.000]  Yeah.
[02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:52.000]  I was wondering why it looks so damn good. I was like, wow, you take these two?
[02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:53.000]  I'm like, wow.
[02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:55.000]  Yeah, there'll be more photos.
[02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:57.000]  They should be coming through soon.
[02:56:57.000 --> 02:56:59.000]  There should be a lot more.
[02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:02.000]  So we'll see what those look like. They should look just as good as you.
[02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:04.000]  I want to do five more minutes with you.
[02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:10.000]  And then Tommy Robinson, political president are facing, I mean, he's already served three months of a 30 month deal.
[02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:12.000]  He got out on appeal.
[02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:14.000]  He's about to go back again. This is incredible.
[02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:20.000]  He's in twice. And then we're going to have Gerald Sloan to take over. But I want to get back into the red button White House thing.
[02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:23.000]  I want to just walk through that because that is big news.
[02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:24.000]  Now you said they'll try to spin that.
[02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:26.000]  Do you want to have you at the chance to lay all that out?
[02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:31.000]  Folks, follow his work at Carpe Donkton and YouTube at Carpe Donkton.
[02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:33.000]  And hopefully soon they'll be launching a website.
[02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:35.000]  He was telling me yesterday he's going to launch a website soon.
[02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:37.000]  We're excited about that because here I just want to win.
[02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:45.000]  And I want to see Carpe Donkton grow more powerful than we can possibly imagine.
[02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:48.000]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York. Marcus, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:51.000]  Hey, Alex. Yeah, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air.
[02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:53.000]  I talked to a lot of people here out in New York City.
[02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:57.000]  And one thing I could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[02:57:57.000 --> 02:58:06.000]  I think that the Neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public approaching 2020.
[02:58:06.000 --> 02:58:10.000]  That's it. I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:12.000]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[02:58:12.000 --> 02:58:14.000]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:20.000]  I agree entirely. And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:23.000]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:25.000]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:28.000]  But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war.
[02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:34.000]  You've won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:36.000]  We're going to keep fighting in the Info War.
[02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:43.000]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[02:58:43.000 --> 02:59:12.000]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[02:59:13.000 --> 02:59:16.000]  God's hand on my shoulder and I feel your love in my heart.
[02:59:16.000 --> 02:59:18.000]  I want you to know that love is right back at you.
[02:59:18.000 --> 02:59:22.000]  And I want to thank you for all you've done with your word of mouth and your prayers and your financial support.
[02:59:22.000 --> 02:59:25.000]  Because I'm committed to fight to the end, but I want to win.
[02:59:25.000 --> 02:59:29.000]  And without you, I'm going to be destroyed and it's not going to be fun.
[02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:32.000]  But that's not what's important. The enemy could win.
[02:59:32.000 --> 02:59:34.000]  We're a key chess piece in this fight.
[02:59:34.000 --> 02:59:36.000]  We're being used by God. You're being used by God.
[02:59:36.000 --> 02:59:37.000]  This is providence.
[02:59:37.000 --> 02:59:41.000]  So I salute you and I thank you for all you've done from the bottom of my heart.
[02:59:41.000 --> 02:59:49.000]  Info Wars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:59:49.000 --> 02:59:55.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:59:55.000 --> 03:00:11.000]  I feel good. I knew that I wouldn't die.
[03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:13.000]  I feel good.
[03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:26.000]  It's been proven statistically, even the UN admits it, the CIA looks at it, their AI can't scan a meme, a video, an image, intelligence funny or not.
[03:00:26.000 --> 03:00:30.000]  So they're having trouble censoring humor because the machines have trouble blocking it.
[03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:32.000]  Leftists can't understand it because they're machines.
[03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:38.000]  Why can't the left meme?
[03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:58.000]  So I've said this for a long time. The reason that I think that the left is so ineffective in memes and really in comedy in general right now is that it all comes from this place of anger and upset feelings and all of these negative emotions.
[03:00:58.000 --> 03:01:16.000]  And when you're trying to produce something funny, that emotion bleeds through. And so everything you do gets tainted by this anger and it feels like a roast, not a good natured or a funny kind of thing.
[03:01:16.000 --> 03:01:34.000]  It feels like just that mean, say the worst thing you can say kind of stuff. Whereas somebody from the right like myself, I'm always approaching it as what's funny, poke fun, but you don't have to destroy the person.
[03:01:34.000 --> 03:01:48.000]  I mean, if you destroy them accidentally, sure. But like when I was going after Biden or when I go after anybody, I'm always trying to find the funny things. I'm not trying to be mean to them.
[03:01:48.000 --> 03:01:55.000]  I'm trying to poke fun at their weaknesses and that will do the job, especially if they come back at me.
[03:01:55.000 --> 03:02:07.000]  Well, that's exactly it. You're just magnifying, struck with like a total demon. And so you just put fire and horns on him. I mean, you just take the truth and then just focus on it.
[03:02:07.000 --> 03:02:24.000]  Right. Now with the left, though, I mean, they also just they use very crass humor. I mean, I can't tell you how many like homophobic or like just terrible, like sexual memes are made about President Trump from the left.
[03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:31.000]  And it's just not funny. I mean, they make stuff that's that's gross, like just just disgusting.
[03:02:31.000 --> 03:02:34.000]  That's everything. They follow none of their own rules.
[03:02:34.000 --> 03:02:42.000]  Oh, which which which we wouldn't even do that stuff anyway. So in closing, you're amazing. I'll be coming back soon. We'll talk to you after the big summit coming up on Thursday.
[03:02:42.000 --> 03:02:47.000]  Carpe Dantum, the red button story, recap that for us.
[03:02:47.000 --> 03:02:56.000]  So we're standing in the Oval Office. We've just taken some pictures and he talked to my kids and he says, you know what that red button does?
[03:02:56.000 --> 03:03:04.000]  And they didn't know. And he said, well, let's let's press and find out. Some people say that it launches launches nukes and so it goes over and presses it.
[03:03:04.000 --> 03:03:12.000]  And then kind of looks around and the kids are looking around to see what happens. And then one of the Secret Service says, I'm right here, Mr. President.
[03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:19.000]  So that's it was a funny moment. But there's the other red button. That one didn't work out so well.
[03:03:19.000 --> 03:03:25.000]  Yeah. So Hillary can make her jokes. But as you said, you're you're you say this for the first time and you were worried before you told the story.
[03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:33.000]  You said earlier that they'll like, oh, he joked around and manipulated the Secret Service or oh, he was joking about nuclear war.
[03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:37.000]  No, he was teasing kids and having a moment of excitement. Something to remember.
[03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:41.000]  And that's the thing about know about Trump is he loves to have fun with everybody.
[03:03:41.000 --> 03:03:51.000]  Oh, yeah, he was he was great. You can tell from just the couple photos there that he was great with my kids and he talked to him and he talked to all of us.
[03:03:51.000 --> 03:03:58.000]  But they had a great time in there. You know, I was I was paranoid the whole time I was in there. I wasn't really that nervous talking to him.
[03:03:58.000 --> 03:04:01.000]  You know, felt kind of like an old friend kind of situation.
[03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:11.000]  But I was paranoid that that my son was going to knock over the the model, the Air Force One model and break it.
[03:04:11.000 --> 03:04:22.000]  That was what I was worried about the whole time. So I was like kind of out of the corner of my eye always watching him make sure he wouldn't knock that model over and then like have to buy a new million dollar model or whatever that thing costs.
[03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:27.000]  Amazing. Well, I tell you, Trump's the real deal. He gets energy off of empowering people.
[03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:33.000]  And he wants to empower America. That's why they're so pissed. There's not just evil in the universe. There's good as well. And Trump is definitely good.
[03:04:33.000 --> 03:04:40.000]  Carpe don't come. You're empowering me. I'm empowering you. We're empowering the president. He's empowering us and good is on the rise again.
[03:04:40.000 --> 03:04:47.000]  We look forward to talking to you after the big Sherman on Thursday and we salute your work, my friend. Thanks for having me, man.
[03:04:47.000 --> 03:04:53.000]  Powerful interview. Tommy Robinson didn't get into his full defense as he faced a certain death.

[03:06:15.000 --> 03:06:27.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center. It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:27.000 --> 03:06:37.000]  We don't take it for granted. And we are not standing here idle and doing nothing. We're fighting and fighting hard.
[03:06:37.000 --> 03:06:45.000]  And one of our champions, who's delivered in Europe and the UK like no other, is facing death.
[03:06:45.000 --> 03:06:50.000]  He's already been asked to attack year in jail for exposing child kidnapping rings.
[03:06:50.000 --> 03:06:54.000]  Instead of being hauled on the shoulders of the people of the UK, he's facing prison again.
[03:06:54.000 --> 03:07:01.000]  And he wanted to finish up before Joe Salante comes on with his whole rundown of how the three convictions,
[03:07:01.000 --> 03:07:08.000]  not of a jury, but of these corrupt judges, and the prison they intend to inflict on him is a victory of evil.
[03:07:08.000 --> 03:07:16.000]  On Thursday, 48 hours away, Tommy Robinson finished up your report that we're going to combine together and get to the president.
[03:07:16.000 --> 03:07:26.000]  Alex, I've shown you my first, the fact that I was supposed to have caused anxiety to these grooming gang pedophiles.
[03:07:26.000 --> 03:07:32.000]  I've showed you the BBC report doing exactly the same. I've showed you the law on the judiciary's website
[03:07:32.000 --> 03:07:36.000]  that they cannot prevent you reporting what's already in the public domain.
[03:07:36.000 --> 03:07:42.000]  There's not ever been any question that anything I said wasn't in the public domain. I didn't report on the proceedings.
[03:07:42.000 --> 03:07:45.000]  I reported information that was already on the BBC News website.
[03:07:45.000 --> 03:07:56.000]  I've showed you the severity of other people's and other journalists reporting which has resulted in prejudicing trials, claps in murder trials, escaping justice for murderers.
[03:07:56.000 --> 03:08:00.000]  You've seen all of them, fines. I've compared them.
[03:08:00.000 --> 03:08:04.000]  Now ask yourself, those more severe breaches got small fines.
[03:08:04.000 --> 03:08:09.000]  Ask yourself why I received the 13 month prison sentence in a kangaroo court back in Leeds.
[03:08:09.000 --> 03:08:18.000]  It's because the British state's politically motivated attempt at shutting down and dissenting voices and generally trying to have me killed by Muslim gangs in prison.
[03:08:18.000 --> 03:08:29.000]  There can be no other reason why when I was given 13 months, I was moved from the safety of whole prison to the most densely Muslim populated prison in this country.
[03:08:29.000 --> 03:08:31.000]  That's where they moved me to.
[03:08:31.000 --> 03:08:36.000]  Now in this country, this is the dangerous thing which everyone should be up in arms about.
[03:08:36.000 --> 03:08:48.000]  If a defendant is accused of a crime that can land them in prison for more than six months, it's the law of this land that they must stand in front of a jury of their peers to ensure fair justice.
[03:08:48.000 --> 03:08:51.000]  This contempt court charge holds a two year prison sentence.
[03:08:51.000 --> 03:08:58.000]  Yet they're refusing me a jury of my peers because they know full well 12 ordinary members of the British public would throw this out.
[03:08:58.000 --> 03:09:08.000]  I would be found not guilty. This is the backdoor way of the Attorney General and the government effectively sends me to death in prison by bypassing the trial by jury.
[03:09:08.000 --> 03:09:15.000]  Even people who don't agree with me and they don't like my views can see that how unbelievably corrupt this entire process is.
[03:09:15.000 --> 03:09:26.000]  The fact that judges heard all the details I've just relayed to you yet still found me guilty makes an embarrassment of the British legal system to what there was once respected across the world.
[03:09:26.000 --> 03:09:31.000]  They do not care. You've seen them. You've seen the betrayal of Brexit democracy.
[03:09:31.000 --> 03:09:33.000]  Everything and people need to wake up.
[03:09:33.000 --> 03:09:38.000]  There are a handful of elites who are connected and they actually don't give a damn what the people actually want or vote for.
[03:09:38.000 --> 03:09:40.000]  They don't care about the British justice system.
[03:09:40.000 --> 03:09:42.000]  Looks an absolute joke across this world.
[03:09:42.000 --> 03:09:45.000]  All they care about is getting what they want.
[03:09:45.000 --> 03:09:48.000]  We are run by nothing but a globalist dictatorship.
[03:09:48.000 --> 03:09:50.000]  The Brit that they moan about Russia.
[03:09:50.000 --> 03:09:51.000]  They moan about China.
[03:09:51.000 --> 03:09:53.000]  They moan about the clampdown on free speech.
[03:09:53.000 --> 03:09:55.000]  They're the biggest bunch of hypocrites walking this planet.
[03:09:55.000 --> 03:09:59.000]  They are traitors that are ruining my beautiful country.
[03:09:59.000 --> 03:10:02.000]  They're removing our fundamental freedom step by step day by day.
[03:10:02.000 --> 03:10:04.000]  Every day we lose our freedoms.
[03:10:04.000 --> 03:10:09.000]  I want to make a genuine appeal to President Trump, to the Republican Party.
[03:10:09.000 --> 03:10:13.000]  Please consider me and my family for political asylum.
[03:10:13.000 --> 03:10:24.000]  The British state's appeasement to Islam, the unrestricted waves of migrants into this country means that they are deliberately persecuting and illegally imprisoning anyone who speaks out against their globalist agenda.
[03:10:24.000 --> 03:10:32.000]  There are Islamic terrorists already serving 30 years in prison that were caught with guns, knives and IEDs on their way to murder me.
[03:10:32.000 --> 03:10:44.000]  The British state has issued me already with nine government official Osmond warnings informing me that there are credible intelligence that Islamic extremists or far-left extremists are plotting to murder me and my family.
[03:10:44.000 --> 03:10:51.000]  Despite this, they refuse to provide me with any of the details of their intelligence, yet they inform me that I cannot take steps to protect myself.
[03:10:51.000 --> 03:10:54.000]  I cannot even defend myself.
[03:10:54.000 --> 03:10:59.000]  I'm asking for political asylum for the safety of my wife, my three beautiful children.
[03:10:59.000 --> 03:11:04.000]  If you have watched this video, you have seen the complete sham of persecution.
[03:11:04.000 --> 03:11:07.000]  My legal team will now look at every avenue to appeal.
[03:11:07.000 --> 03:11:09.000]  The only option I have is to fight.
[03:11:09.000 --> 03:11:12.000]  If I'm put in prison, the only option I have is to fight.
[03:11:12.000 --> 03:11:15.000]  Every time I walk out my door, the only option I have is to fight.
[03:11:15.000 --> 03:11:22.000]  So I only know how to fight and I'll fight you if I'm asking for political asylum, but if I'm left here, I get my written judgment.
[03:11:22.000 --> 03:11:25.000]  I'm waiting on my written judgment for how I've been found guilty.
[03:11:25.000 --> 03:11:29.000]  This prosecution has already cost, which is one of the reasons they stick on me as well.
[03:11:29.000 --> 03:11:34.000]  It's cost over £115,000 in legal fees.
[03:11:34.000 --> 03:11:36.000]  The costs continue to escalate.
[03:11:36.000 --> 03:11:44.000]  I need to lodge an appeal as quickly as possible so I can work towards getting me released so I can prevent my murder in prison.
[03:11:44.000 --> 03:11:48.000]  Anyone who can help or support, we have an appeal fund.
[03:11:48.000 --> 03:11:49.000]  We have a website.
[03:11:49.000 --> 03:11:52.000]  It's tommyappeal.com.
[03:11:52.000 --> 03:12:01.000]  I am, my real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, but we are all Tommy Robinson.
[03:12:01.000 --> 03:12:05.000]  Our freedoms in Britain are eroding.
[03:12:05.000 --> 03:12:06.000]  They're being taken.
[03:12:06.000 --> 03:12:13.000]  This is a plea to America and a warning to the United States, a warning to every single one of you.
[03:12:13.000 --> 03:12:25.000]  You see the opposition, the people and the groups that oppose you, the dark forces at work, the report, President Trump, the false dossier of Russia.
[03:12:25.000 --> 03:12:31.000]  The false Russian dossier was created here by someone working for our government.
[03:12:31.000 --> 03:12:35.000]  That's the level of deep, dark corruption in my country.
[03:12:35.000 --> 03:12:39.000]  They have built against you and worked against you and I'm pleading with you.
[03:12:39.000 --> 03:12:43.000]  I will be left to be murdered in this country.
[03:12:43.000 --> 03:12:51.000]  I'm a journalist and I'm going to be sentenced to prison on Thursday for journalism.
[03:12:51.000 --> 03:13:00.000]  The country you think you understand, the country you look to, the country that many people admire around the world, it's gone.
[03:13:00.000 --> 03:13:02.000]  It's changed.
[03:13:02.000 --> 03:13:06.000]  The level of corruption.
[03:13:06.000 --> 03:13:08.000]  We knew we had a corrupt media.
[03:13:08.000 --> 03:13:09.000]  We knew that.
[03:13:09.000 --> 03:13:10.000]  We all know that.
[03:13:10.000 --> 03:13:12.000]  We witnessed it all the time.
[03:13:12.000 --> 03:13:22.000]  We knew by the cover-ups, by the government and the police force that we had a corrupt police all aligning them, cooperating together to suppress the truth about the rape of a generation.
[03:13:22.000 --> 03:13:23.000]  Understand this.
[03:13:23.000 --> 03:13:25.000]  When I talk about these issues, understand this.
[03:13:25.000 --> 03:13:27.000]  This happened to a relative of mine.
[03:13:27.000 --> 03:13:29.000]  She was a victim of one of these gangs.
[03:13:29.000 --> 03:13:34.000]  I have traveled across this country, meeting the families, meeting the victims.
[03:13:34.000 --> 03:13:48.000]  They, you know, if people understood the true length and the numbers, and it goes against their shared, their vision that they want for this world, this open border policy, all cultures are equal.
[03:13:48.000 --> 03:13:50.000]  Everyone's the same.
[03:13:50.000 --> 03:13:57.000]  It completely contradicts it when a culture comes in and enslaves a generation of our daughters.
[03:13:57.000 --> 03:13:59.000]  And it's that that they're trying to hide.
[03:13:59.000 --> 03:14:04.000]  It's the embarrassment that I bring with my news reports.
[03:14:04.000 --> 03:14:08.000]  I worked on the biggest expose of the BBC this country's ever seen.
[03:14:08.000 --> 03:14:10.000]  A documentary called Panadrama.
[03:14:10.000 --> 03:14:14.000]  Five days after Panadrama, these charges were re-bought against me.
[03:14:14.000 --> 03:14:26.000]  24 hours after Panadrama, big tech, social media, YouTube, Facebook all removed me because I exposed exactly the accusations you make, President Trump.
[03:14:26.000 --> 03:14:30.000]  The accusations you make of the BBC being fake news.
[03:14:30.000 --> 03:14:32.000]  I called it all on camera.
[03:14:32.000 --> 03:14:33.000]  I called it all on camera.
[03:14:33.000 --> 03:14:34.000]  And guess what?
[03:14:34.000 --> 03:14:39.000]  In the biggest expose, not one single British journalist mentioned it.
[03:14:39.000 --> 03:14:41.000]  That is the proof of a corrupt media.
[03:14:41.000 --> 03:14:42.000]  That is the proof.
[03:14:42.000 --> 03:14:44.000]  They are not journalists.
[03:14:44.000 --> 03:14:45.000]  They are activists.
[03:14:45.000 --> 03:14:53.000]  And they're working against the sole interests of the people of this country, the country I love.
[03:14:53.000 --> 03:15:02.000]  And I ask again, if you're watching this, if you're in the administration of President Trump, Donald Trump, Jr.
[03:15:02.000 --> 03:15:04.000]  I'm pleading with you.
[03:15:04.000 --> 03:15:07.000]  Please raise concerns over this case.
[03:15:07.000 --> 03:15:13.000]  I promise you all of the information, all my own barristers have said they've gone against the law.
[03:15:13.000 --> 03:15:17.000]  My own barristers said that it's impossible for me to get convicted.
[03:15:17.000 --> 03:15:20.000]  Yeah, I've been found guilty of all three charges.
[03:15:20.000 --> 03:15:26.000]  Tommy, we get that you're a trooper and this is about the rape and enslavement of a generation.
[03:15:26.000 --> 03:15:29.000]  And it's up to the audience and the listeners to send the videos.
[03:15:29.000 --> 03:15:35.000]  We're going to post to infowars.com, to whitehouse.gov, to all the radio and TV stations to make a big issue out of this.
[03:15:35.000 --> 03:15:40.000]  You should join us again tomorrow with a countdown to them trying to make you a political prisoner.

[03:17:54.000 --> 03:17:57.000]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York. Marcus, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[03:17:57.000 --> 03:18:00.000]  Hey, Alex. Yeah, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air.
[03:18:00.000 --> 03:18:06.000]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[03:18:06.000 --> 03:18:16.000]  I think that the Neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public approaching 2020.
[03:18:16.000 --> 03:18:19.000]  That's it. I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[03:18:19.000 --> 03:18:22.000]  It's the only way I think he could be defeated other than assassinating him.
[03:18:22.000 --> 03:18:23.000]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[03:18:23.000 --> 03:18:29.000]  I agree entirely. And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[03:18:29.000 --> 03:18:32.000]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[03:18:32.000 --> 03:18:34.000]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[03:18:34.000 --> 03:18:37.000]  But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war.
[03:18:37.000 --> 03:18:43.000]  You've won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[03:18:43.000 --> 03:18:52.000]  We're going to keep fighting in the Info War. And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[03:18:52.000 --> 03:18:53.000]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[03:18:54.000 --> 03:18:56.000]  Robert Barnes, what has Big Tech become?
[03:18:56.000 --> 03:18:58.000]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies.
[03:18:58.000 --> 03:19:05.000]  And the way they did so is because they face no consequence of social, economic, political or legal for their illicit activities over two decades.
[03:19:05.000 --> 03:19:10.000]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the independent free press that care about this,
[03:19:10.000 --> 03:19:17.000]  the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this have to bring real social, political, economic consequence to their course of conduct.
[03:19:17.000 --> 03:19:23.000]  Otherwise they will never change and they will become the big tech oligarchs, the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century,
[03:19:23.000 --> 03:19:28.000]  who ran American politics and ran American economy almost into the ground until we were able to recover after the Great Depression.
[03:19:28.000 --> 03:19:36.000]  The Info War's audience is the fuel that flames the light of liberty across the world to make real the actions of independent free speech,
[03:19:36.000 --> 03:19:39.000]  to make real the original promise of an independent free press,
[03:19:39.000 --> 03:19:46.000]  real collusion is Big Tech and Big Media manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle with elections, to try to shake people's thoughts.
[03:19:46.000 --> 03:19:49.000]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening.
[03:19:49.000 --> 03:20:15.000]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting. What you just saw isn't what you just saw. Even it is what you just saw.
[03:20:15.000 --> 03:20:20.000]  So let's say it's taken over right now. Top Trends Forecaster, good friend of mine.
[03:20:20.000 --> 03:20:29.000]  I don't want to point something out. The new Spider-Man movie has a villain broadcaster that they're admitting in mainstream news,
[03:20:29.000 --> 03:20:37.000]  supposedly Alex Jones. He's a horrible criminal that sets people up. Did I go see the movie? No. Do I care? No.
[03:20:37.000 --> 03:20:41.000]  Because that doesn't matter. Everybody knows it's not true.
[03:20:41.000 --> 03:20:50.000]  And you talk about somebody like Tommy Robinson who was put in jail for a year when he exposed rape gangs 11 years ago,
[03:20:50.000 --> 03:20:56.000]  and then served three months in solitary confinement, a 30 month conviction for covering a rape trial.
[03:20:56.000 --> 03:21:05.000]  He's facing three charges they've convicted him. The judges have no, no, no, no jury. It's a death sentence.
[03:21:05.000 --> 03:21:15.000]  And he's just trying to warn people. But if Trump exposed it, if Trump gave him asylum to show what a police state the UK is,
[03:21:15.000 --> 03:21:22.000]  it'd be a big victory against tyranny. The truth is good people fall asleep. That's why he was spreading so fast.
[03:21:22.000 --> 03:21:29.000]  I just want to say this briefly because I didn't plug last hour with Carpe Dantamon.
[03:21:29.000 --> 03:21:41.000]  It's a shell of products that make this show possible. We have the new Betsy Ross flag shirt when they banned that off Nike tennis shoes.
[03:21:41.000 --> 03:21:47.000]  I thought, hell, we ought to put these shirt out. I said, well, I'm going to print 4,000, one blue, one white, two different variants.
[03:21:47.000 --> 03:21:59.000]  One says, said 1776 with the flag. The other says these colors don't run on the back. It says America's back in force.com.
[03:21:59.000 --> 03:22:04.000]  There were 2,000 left up this morning. I don't know. They're going to sell out probably today. Thank you for the support.
[03:22:04.000 --> 03:22:09.000]  It takes a lot more money than that though to fund this operation. Oh, you sell 4,000 shirts, make like 10 bucks a piece on them.
[03:22:09.000 --> 03:22:14.000]  It takes a lot to do what we do here. Got a lot of undercover stuff, a lot of behind the scenes things you don't know about.
[03:22:14.000 --> 03:22:24.000]  M4s is just the tip of the spear. There's a lot of things going on that people don't know about because that's the best way to act against the globalists.
[03:22:24.000 --> 03:22:29.000]  And so please go to M4store.com. Get your Betsy Ross flag shirt.
[03:22:29.000 --> 03:22:35.000]  It's the last day of the Fourth of July specials free shipping store wide, double paid 3.50% off supplements.
[03:22:35.000 --> 03:22:40.000]  M4store.com. Without you, we won't continue to operate. So thank you all for your support.
[03:22:40.000 --> 03:22:45.000]  I turn this over now to Gerald Salente, the trans forecaster for the next 40 minutes or so. Appreciate him.
[03:22:45.000 --> 03:22:49.000]  Let me take over a little bit. Tommy was behind. He had a lot more cover.
[03:22:49.000 --> 03:22:56.000]  It's just a dark day when journalists are being put in prison for exposing what's happening.
[03:22:56.000 --> 03:23:01.000]  But evil's going to fall in the end. Gerald Salente, thank you for being here.
[03:23:01.000 --> 03:23:05.000]  No, thanks for all that you do. And yes, journalists are in prison.
[03:23:05.000 --> 03:23:13.000]  Look at Julian Assange and all those Democratic liberals, they got locked your on that one except Tulsi Gabbard.
[03:23:13.000 --> 03:23:16.000]  Journalism is dead. Fourth of state is dead.
[03:23:16.000 --> 03:23:22.000]  There's the first estate is the you have the executive branch, congressional branch and judicial branch.
[03:23:22.000 --> 03:23:27.000]  The fourth estate is the journalism branch and journalism is gone.
[03:23:27.000 --> 03:23:31.000]  They've cut back reporters and there's hardly any news.
[03:23:31.000 --> 03:23:37.000]  You look at the toilet paper, record the New York Times, you go to its business section today.
[03:23:37.000 --> 03:23:41.000]  And it's just a couple of pages of nothing and mostly big pictures.
[03:23:41.000 --> 03:23:43.000]  So it's very sad what's happened.
[03:23:43.000 --> 03:23:49.000]  So it's very important that people tune into info wars and, of course, our magazine, The Trends Journal,
[03:23:49.000 --> 03:23:54.000]  to get the truth in trends and the truth in news because you're not getting it anywhere else.
[03:23:54.000 --> 03:24:01.000]  As the mainstream media has been taken over. So nine was a six companies over 90% of it.
[03:24:01.000 --> 03:24:04.000]  So they're not journalists. They're prostitutes.
[03:24:04.000 --> 03:24:10.000]  They get paid to put out by their corporate johns and their government whormasters.
[03:24:10.000 --> 03:24:13.000]  So press is dead.
[03:24:13.000 --> 03:24:18.000]  I like to talk about I'm talking about a little bit about what's going on in the world today.
[03:24:18.000 --> 03:24:25.000]  They had an election over there in Greece yesterday and the fellow that won.
[03:24:25.000 --> 03:24:29.000]  Great as far as daddy was prime minister before him.
[03:24:29.000 --> 03:24:33.000]  Another guy born on third base and thought he had a home run.
[03:24:33.000 --> 03:24:38.000]  Harvard boy, Harvard Princeton Yale bullets, bombs and banks.
[03:24:38.000 --> 03:24:41.000]  The jerk before him, Cyprus.
[03:24:41.000 --> 03:24:50.000]  And you know, I'd like to say, but they'd bleep me out if I pronounced his name properly with the taking out the T on it.
[03:24:50.000 --> 03:24:57.000]  And what he did was the people voted against the austerity measures.
[03:24:57.000 --> 03:25:02.000]  That the International Mafia Federation.
[03:25:02.000 --> 03:25:07.000]  Label the International Monetary Fund put on Greece.
[03:25:07.000 --> 03:25:11.000]  Over 60% of the people voted against your austerity measures.
[03:25:11.000 --> 03:25:15.000]  Cyprus, the guy that's on his way out now.
[03:25:15.000 --> 03:25:19.000]  We could care less what you want. We're in shock.
[03:25:19.000 --> 03:25:21.000]  And that's what it is around the world.
[03:25:21.000 --> 03:25:26.000]  Democracy, democracy does not exist.
[03:25:26.000 --> 03:25:29.000]  How about those clowns over there in the European Union?
[03:25:29.000 --> 03:25:44.000]  Oh, they just they just voted in a number of people. Matter of fact, one of them to head the European Central Bank is Christine Lagarde, the former head of the IMF, the International Mafia Federation.
[03:25:44.000 --> 03:25:48.000]  And all the other three people they put into top positions, nobody voted.
[03:25:48.000 --> 03:25:52.000]  They decided we'll decide for you.
[03:25:52.000 --> 03:26:01.000]  You know, there's going to be a movement on Facebook and anybody says, don't get out to vote in the 2020 elections, they're going to ban it.
[03:26:01.000 --> 03:26:08.000]  And so there's a big movement on the way to ban people that aren't going to vote.
[03:26:08.000 --> 03:26:15.000]  What if you don't want to support the repulsive Kins and Democraps?
[03:26:15.000 --> 03:26:21.000]  What if you want a new way, like many other countries have, not allowed in the USA?
[03:26:21.000 --> 03:26:30.000]  We got the two ruling parties, the Bloods and the Crips, and morons and imbeciles call the Republicans and the Democrats.
[03:26:30.000 --> 03:26:35.000]  I say Bloods and the Crips because by their deeds, you shall know them.
[03:26:35.000 --> 03:26:41.000]  They're murderers and their thieves. They start wars based on lies and steal our money.
[03:26:41.000 --> 03:26:47.000]  Too big to fail. Oh, people are worrying about capitalism being dead and socialism taking over.
[03:26:47.000 --> 03:26:53.000]  Capitalism is long dead. In capitalism, there's no such thing as too big to fail.
[03:26:53.000 --> 03:26:58.000]  Hey, but we got to protect our banks, the buddies, you know.
[03:26:58.000 --> 03:27:08.000]  So talking about Greece to some of the data, Greece's financial straitjacket is fueling a brain drain.
[03:27:08.000 --> 03:27:18.000]  Some 500,000 people have left the country from 2010 to 2017.
[03:27:18.000 --> 03:27:24.000]  It's the deepest setback since the Great Depression in the 1930s.
[03:27:24.000 --> 03:27:42.000]  The Greece economy is still 24% smaller than it was. 24% smaller than it was in 2007.
[03:27:42.000 --> 03:27:49.000]  Those austerity measures worked perfectly. Yeah, they only have, I think, unemployment.
[03:27:49.000 --> 03:27:58.000]  Oh, it's only 18%. But now they got in a guy.
[03:27:58.000 --> 03:28:09.000]  Mitzotakis. Stanford and Harvard.
[03:28:09.000 --> 03:28:14.000]  Daddy was prime minister before. So you know where this is going.
[03:28:14.000 --> 03:28:25.000]  More of the same. Just another country in the multinational plantation of slave landia, slave landia.
[03:28:25.000 --> 03:28:30.000]  We're going to get rid of your social benefits, your retirement.
[03:28:30.000 --> 03:28:37.000]  We're going to move to after you die and forget about your pensions. They don't exist anymore.
[03:28:37.000 --> 03:28:53.000]  So another corrupt government. More of the same. Back in fuel.
[03:28:53.000 --> 03:29:08.000]  When you have a pain in the neck, a real pain in the neck, back, shoulder, or legs, you now have two convenient choices to get fast relief without taking another pill.
[03:29:08.000 --> 03:29:26.000]  These are available at both Amazon and Walmart. Yes, see Sunny Bay's four and a half to five star customer reviews on Amazon.com or Walmart.com.

[03:29:54.000 --> 03:30:02.000]  We'll be very, very clear with everybody about all of this. We're going into the season of war and they have been inches from shutting down the final mega counts we have.
[03:30:02.000 --> 03:30:09.000]  There's their criminal activity and their digital fraud and we need to know that we've got capital to go six months a year. We need to end here.
[03:30:09.000 --> 03:30:15.000]  We need to be provisioned and you've got my total commitment that I am going to rampage forward against the enemy.
[03:30:15.000 --> 03:30:25.000]  Obviously, I'm loving every minute of this because I know I'm getting under their skin. I'm bloody and then I'm up politically. I'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies.
[03:30:25.000 --> 03:30:32.000]  That just brings more people here. So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you and I need war bonds. I need gas. I need ammo politically now.
[03:30:32.000 --> 03:30:40.000]  But literally, if you flood us with money and if you flood us with product purchases and if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable. We're unstoppable together.
[03:30:40.000 --> 03:30:48.000]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy. I want to raise a couple million dollars right now to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing and that you will stand with us and I will never back down.
[03:30:48.000 --> 03:30:54.000]  You have my commitment. This only gives me more energy and more understanding of what we're facing and that we were right about this.
[03:30:54.000 --> 03:31:06.000]  I talk about this on the air and I know it sinks into people but I've decided that we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go back five, six years ago before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it,
[03:31:06.000 --> 03:31:12.000]  I'm going to talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were and I'd have doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good.
[03:31:12.000 --> 03:31:20.000]  And instead the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us or they'll shut us down. The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful they were.
[03:31:20.000 --> 03:31:34.000]  And the left always has headlines everywhere. Jones sells unapproved supplements. He claims they're supplements. No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[03:31:34.000 --> 03:31:41.000]  They say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things.
[03:31:41.000 --> 03:31:48.000]  And a lot of drugs work great. They have side effects, not with Mother Nature, but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest.
[03:31:48.000 --> 03:32:05.000]  InfowarsStore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[03:32:19.000 --> 03:32:28.000]  That in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country, they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this because this was the kind of press they wanted.
[03:32:28.000 --> 03:32:39.000]  And then ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate what news and views the person's allowed to have or express or hear.
[03:32:39.000 --> 03:32:47.000]  And the infowars audience has broken through that. They are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate American democracy and freedom.
[03:32:47.000 --> 03:32:54.000]  And that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of deep blackwarming defamation, lawfare and libel targeting youth.
[03:33:17.000 --> 03:33:22.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:33:22.000 --> 03:33:29.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show with Gerald Salente.
[03:33:29.000 --> 03:33:33.000]  Hey, hey, welcome back, welcome back.
[03:33:33.000 --> 03:33:37.000]  Well, the market's opened up today. So what's going on in the market world?
[03:33:37.000 --> 03:33:43.000]  Well, over there in Turkey over the weekend, Erdogan removes central bank chief.
[03:33:43.000 --> 03:33:49.000]  Erdogan, of course, is a president. They are the prime minister or president.
[03:33:49.000 --> 03:34:04.000]  And he dismissed the governor of Turkey's central bank during fresh investor concern over the independence of the institution at a strain to combat inflation.
[03:34:04.000 --> 03:34:13.000]  I mentioned that because over the weekend, President Trump also took aim at the Federal Reserve.
[03:34:13.000 --> 03:34:22.000]  He said, quote, strong jobs report. Yeah, you saw that those job numbers that came out. They were much stronger than anticipated.
[03:34:22.000 --> 03:34:32.000]  Low inflation and other countries around the world doing anything possible to take advantage of the United States, knowing that our Federal Reserve doesn't have a clue.
[03:34:32.000 --> 03:34:39.000]  They raised rates too soon, too often, and tightened while others did just the opposite.
[03:34:39.000 --> 03:34:44.000]  Well, not all of them did the opposite. That's what I got rid of the cat over there in Turkey.
[03:34:44.000 --> 03:34:53.000]  They kept raising interest rates. They're like a 24 percent interest rate over there trying to stop inflation.
[03:34:53.000 --> 03:34:59.000]  So the point I'm making is that, yes, the president could get rid of the Fed.
[03:34:59.000 --> 03:35:03.000]  They say that they can't. They do. They got rid of the cat in India as well.
[03:35:03.000 --> 03:35:07.000]  And let's get this straight. All these central banksters are connected.
[03:35:07.000 --> 03:35:11.000]  It's one big club. It was George Colin used to say, it's one big club and you're not in it.
[03:35:11.000 --> 03:35:20.000]  I just mentioned who became the clown boy now that's playing prime minister of Greece.
[03:35:20.000 --> 03:35:29.000]  Daddy was prime minister or president of Greece and went to Harvard.
[03:35:29.000 --> 03:35:35.000]  Harvard, Princeton, Yale, bullets, bombs and banks, one big club.
[03:35:35.000 --> 03:35:44.000]  So on Friday, Trump said, if we had a Fed that would lower interest rates, we'd be like a rocket ship.
[03:35:44.000 --> 03:35:51.000]  But we're paying a lot of interest and it's unnecessary, but we don't have a Fed that knows what they're doing.
[03:35:51.000 --> 03:35:58.000]  So it's one of those little things. But if we had a Fed that would lower rates, you would have a rocket ship.
[03:35:58.000 --> 03:36:08.000]  Yes and no. The low rates allow the big companies to get bigger.
[03:36:08.000 --> 03:36:17.000]  Stock buybacks is what they do with most of the cheap money they get as we saw the details in 2018 with the tax cuts.
[03:36:17.000 --> 03:36:24.000]  Nearly a billion, excuse me, a trillion dollars was spent in stock buyback.
[03:36:24.000 --> 03:36:29.000]  So the other thing low interest rates are, there are war against savers.
[03:36:29.000 --> 03:36:38.000]  When I was a young boy, used to have a thing called savings and loan institutions.
[03:36:38.000 --> 03:36:47.000]  You put your money in a savings account and you got interest on it. Then you retire to Florida. Those days are gone.
[03:36:47.000 --> 03:36:53.000]  On the other hand, the low interest rates keep the economy moving.
[03:36:53.000 --> 03:37:09.000]  As interest rates go lower, you see the housing market going higher. And by the way, when you follow your trends and you look at the investment in the stock markets in the real estate sector,
[03:37:09.000 --> 03:37:15.000]  you're moving up nicely. Why? Because they expect lower rates and so do we.
[03:37:15.000 --> 03:37:22.000]  So we're going to know very shortly whether the Federal Reserve is going to lower interest rates this July.
[03:37:22.000 --> 03:37:29.000]  The bet was, the hope was for 50 basis points. It's only 2.25 to 2.50 overnight rate right now.
[03:37:29.000 --> 03:37:39.000]  But now they're seeing about a 25%, excuse me, yeah, 0.25%, not 25%, 0.25% interest rate cut.
[03:37:39.000 --> 03:37:45.000]  So it still looks like it's on the table. And the way you could tell it's on the table is by looking at gold prices.
[03:37:45.000 --> 03:37:50.000]  They came down from a recent high, but there's still around the 1400 level.
[03:37:50.000 --> 03:37:57.000]  If interest rates are going to go a lot higher, gold will go a lot lower because the higher the dollar goes, the lower gold follows.
[03:37:57.000 --> 03:38:03.000]  As with most commodities, because you buy about 40% of commodities, the gold are dollar based.
[03:38:03.000 --> 03:38:08.000]  But the higher the dollar goes, the more expensive it is to those commodities.
[03:38:08.000 --> 03:38:15.000]  So those prices go lower. So gold is holding up.
[03:38:15.000 --> 03:38:24.000]  I believe the Federal Reserve is going to aggressively lower interest rates between now and the 2020 elections and that Trump does have power over them.
[03:38:24.000 --> 03:38:33.000]  Because you read the numbers coming out. And again, we just had the biggest monthly increase in U.S. jobs for 2019.
[03:38:33.000 --> 03:38:36.000]  So that eased the concern of slowdowns.
[03:38:36.000 --> 03:38:42.000]  But when you look at other data, it's not that great around the world.
[03:38:42.000 --> 03:38:48.000]  China's factory activity in June was the lowest since January.
[03:38:48.000 --> 03:38:54.000]  China's short-term borrowing costs are 10-year low after liquidity injections.
[03:38:54.000 --> 03:39:02.000]  Monetary methadone, that's all this is, shoot more cheap money into the system to prop it up.
[03:39:02.000 --> 03:39:05.000]  They got to do it.
[03:39:05.000 --> 03:39:15.000]  The SUVs pile up with more on their way. This is just fresh news. Sales, of course, are slowing.
[03:39:15.000 --> 03:39:21.000]  Models are sitting longer and dealership lots before being sold.
[03:39:21.000 --> 03:39:29.000]  And companies are resorting to more sales promotions to keep inventory from piling up.
[03:39:29.000 --> 03:39:39.000]  Let me go back to some other little news. Forge U.S. sales fell 2.9 percent.
[03:39:39.000 --> 03:39:46.000]  The mid-soft market.
[03:39:46.000 --> 03:40:01.000]  Go around the world. Germany's industrial orders fell 2.2 percent far more than expected in May.
[03:40:01.000 --> 03:40:13.000]  And the economy minister warned that this sector of Europe's largest economy was likely to remain weeks in the coming months.
[03:40:13.000 --> 03:40:17.000]  You got a global slowdown.
[03:40:17.000 --> 03:40:26.000]  And manufacturing-aligned copper weakens. This is a very important story.
[03:40:26.000 --> 03:40:33.000]  Current events form future trends. I'm going over these details to put things into perspective.
[03:40:33.000 --> 03:40:37.000]  In the business, we call it Dr. Copper. That's right.
[03:40:37.000 --> 03:40:47.000]  Dr. Copper, because copper is an indicator of the health of the global economy.
[03:40:47.000 --> 03:40:51.000]  China uses over 50 percent of all the new copper produced.
[03:40:51.000 --> 03:40:57.000]  Copper is used in everything from heavy industry to high-tech.
[03:40:57.000 --> 03:41:03.000]  The retreating copper prices is signaling continued investor concerns for the global economy.
[03:41:03.000 --> 03:41:11.000]  Copper, which is critical, they say to construction and manufacturing fell 1.7 percent last week,
[03:41:11.000 --> 03:41:27.000]  pairing some of its rally from June and bringing its decline from an April high to 11 percent.
[03:41:27.000 --> 03:41:33.000]  Copper prices have fallen in eight of the past 10 weeks.
[03:41:33.000 --> 03:41:36.000]  There's a global slowdown going on.
[03:41:36.000 --> 03:41:44.000]  Oh, and by the way, it has nothing to do with trade wars, boys and girls and children of all ages.
[03:41:44.000 --> 03:41:51.000]  Just like those car sales, the Americans care about trade war going on, and that's why they're not buying cars.
[03:41:51.000 --> 03:41:57.000]  That's what happens when that happens in China. The media blames it on trade wars.
[03:41:57.000 --> 03:42:10.000]  It has nothing to do with it. By the way, China's yearly car sale number is now the worst since the 1990s in terms of a downturn.
[03:42:10.000 --> 03:42:15.000]  They blame it on trade wars. It's a slowing global economy.
[03:42:15.000 --> 03:42:23.000]  More monetary methadone, and that's just going to push gold prices up and keep them higher.
[03:42:23.000 --> 03:42:31.000]  So we believe gold is near its bottom, and I'll talk about a little bit more where its top is.
[03:42:31.000 --> 03:42:39.000]  And again, I don't give financial advice. I'm a trend forecaster, and the forecaster becoming clear and clear.
[03:42:39.000 --> 03:42:46.000]  We'll be back in just a few minutes. Stay tuned.
[03:42:46.000 --> 03:43:09.000]  The Info Wars, the most banned network in the world.
[03:43:09.000 --> 03:43:20.000]  The independent press of this size and scale, of this public reach, it is the one model that says here's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining, self-structured, little de-democratic structure
[03:43:20.000 --> 03:43:28.000]  that because the audience determines what content goes up, the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices in supporting Info Wars.
[03:43:28.000 --> 03:43:37.000]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate driven model
[03:43:37.000 --> 03:43:46.000]  and the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[03:43:46.000 --> 03:43:54.000]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment, and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[03:43:54.000 --> 03:44:09.000]  Serving with Info Wars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee. And luckily, our break room at the Info Wars headquarters is stock full of high quality Info Wars store, Patriot blend coffee.

[03:44:54.000 --> 03:45:09.000]  The globalists are hyper competitive scientific dictators. They are technocrats. They are control freaks in their own words. And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[03:45:09.000 --> 03:45:13.000]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace. We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[03:45:13.000 --> 03:45:25.000]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies. If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from ForrestLive.com, I couldn't do it.

[03:46:54.000 --> 03:47:00.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:47:13.000 --> 03:47:21.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Gerald Salente. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:47:21.000 --> 03:47:25.000]  It's getting there.
[03:47:25.000 --> 03:47:40.000]  Hey, welcome back. Welcome back. It's great being on Alex Jones show. I want to thank him for having me on and all the people at info wars to bring out the news you could use as they're censoring everything else around the world.
[03:47:40.000 --> 03:47:51.000]  Not only in the U. S. S. A. It's everywhere. You know, those riots are going on over there in in Hong Kong. People protesting the extradition law.
[03:47:51.000 --> 03:48:05.000]  Guess what? Not news in China. It's blanked out. It's like happening. America. Anyway, great being here. And you know, you have to do put your money where your heart is to keep info wars going.
[03:48:05.000 --> 03:48:17.000]  Because things are getting tough as a censorship keeps getting deeper. So it's up to you to keep the truth alive. And you could do that with the Betsy Ross 1776 limited edition shirt.
[03:48:17.000 --> 03:48:21.000]  Unlike the politically correct cowards.
[03:48:21.000 --> 03:48:39.000]  Info wars is bringing you an all new design featuring the pride and joy of revolutionary America, the Betsy Ross flag. Now you can share with the world your patriotism and love of freedom while letting the liberals and
[03:48:39.000 --> 03:48:54.000]  fellow craps know that these colors don't run limited edition print, which is 4000 in stock. And I heard Alex say just before I went on the air that that stocks dropped a lot.
[03:48:54.000 --> 03:49:05.000]  There may not be many left. This shirt features two separate designs and two different colors with only 1000 of each design and again, less of those now.
[03:49:05.000 --> 03:49:15.000]  The shoes between the since 77 these six and these colors don't run taglines with blue or white background.
[03:49:15.000 --> 03:49:24.000]  So you can to support info wars and all the other great products. And you know me. I love that super male vitality.
[03:49:24.000 --> 03:49:39.000]  I mentioned before about the EU picking unelected leaders and I couldn't remember all who they were. So what they did over there was they got
[03:49:39.000 --> 03:49:54.000]  German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen will head the European Commission. An ally of Angela Merkel. She is a major proponent of an EU super army Spanish Foreign Minister.
[03:49:54.000 --> 03:50:12.000]  Joseph Fontalis will run the EU foreign policy. Christine Lagarde will move from the International Mafia Federation to the European Central Bank and Belgium Prime Minister Charles Michel will replace tusk as European Council President.
[03:50:12.000 --> 03:50:28.000]  And all you little clowns in all those European nations, you didn't vote for one of them. They get it here like everybody else. Oh, we need the EU, the EU to FU. That's right.
[03:50:28.000 --> 03:50:43.000]  Stelt it wrong. Yeah. What a joke. It's no joke. And these clowns, these arrogant little boys and little girls to be fair.
[03:50:43.000 --> 03:51:00.000]  It keeps invading foreign nations under the BS that they're bringing in democracy as they don't have a hint of it over there. European Union. Well, you are as a colony of Germany.
[03:51:00.000 --> 03:51:22.000]  That's the quote. Mr. What is his name again? Savona. That's right. Mr. Savona, who was going to be EU's economic minister, but they wouldn't let him become one because all he said is that the rest of the countries have become colonies of
[03:51:22.000 --> 03:51:40.000]  Germany. Hello, Savona. And he's right because if Germans had the Deutsche Mark, rather than the worthless euro, they wouldn't be able to sell their stuff the way they do and be one of the world's largest
[03:51:40.000 --> 03:51:55.000]  parties. So moving on. And why you need to support info wars. And of course, the Trends Journal. We're coming out the new edition this week. Sunday Talk shows falter and the ratings,
[03:51:55.000 --> 03:52:17.000]  face the nation and meet the prostitutes. The client 8% in 2018 to about 2.3 million average viewers, 2.3 million average viewers in a nation of over 320 million people.
[03:52:17.000 --> 03:52:32.000]  And this gets press that we have these major networks that barely anybody watches. But boy, are they great propagandists putting out the BS.
[03:52:32.000 --> 03:52:50.000]  The average audience, the evening newscast ABC CBS NBC. 5.3 million. Again, in a nation of over 320 million. China must be jealous.
[03:52:50.000 --> 03:53:03.000]  You know, one of the things I don't support jumping a number of things. I'm not a believer in one person one way. And I say what I like, say what I don't like. I'm a political atheist.
[03:53:03.000 --> 03:53:23.000]  I want to choose the borders. And you know me I want to have a I want to have a man I want to have a on the ballots. I want to have a referendum. Yes, I support open immigration and I'm willing to pay X amount of dollars in education,
[03:53:23.000 --> 03:53:38.000]  healthcare and housing for each new immigrant. No. I want secure borders and I'm willing to pay X amount of money to make it happen. Simple.
[03:53:38.000 --> 03:53:54.000]  What do people vote. So anyway, I agree with them on that. And of course, I agree with them 100% on the trade issue. I disagree with tariffs. I say just put in place what used to exist before.
[03:53:54.000 --> 03:54:12.000]  Slick Willie Clinton sold us out with NAFTA and the World Trade Organization. And bringing China into it. China's debt level went before they came into the World Trade Association.
[03:54:12.000 --> 03:54:33.000]  From about a trillion dollars over 40 trillion today. The middle class was 5%. Now it's 35%. In other words, they have more middle class plus 100 million people in America as a nation.
[03:54:33.000 --> 03:54:47.000]  And I don't blame the Chinese for this. I blame the American companies and European companies for bringing all their technology and manufacturing there to have slaves make their stuff really cheaply and then bring it back and mark up the prices.
[03:54:47.000 --> 03:55:07.000]  So trade gap showed widening in May. Yep, the trade gap in goods and services jumped 8.4% in May to a seasonally adjusted 55.5 to billion dollars.
[03:55:07.000 --> 03:55:28.000]  Regarding US trade with China, the bilateral goods deficit widened in May by 12%. Who would do business like this? You name me, anybody in business that would do losing business like this. No one in the world.
[03:55:28.000 --> 03:55:38.000]  If a Democrat came out against...
[03:55:38.000 --> 03:56:00.000]  You're about a minute away from the end of what happened. Trying to reconnect, it's not letting me do it.
[03:56:00.000 --> 03:56:16.000]  The price and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[03:56:16.000 --> 03:56:38.000]  Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it. You know what I want to do? I want to get it finished. The price I want is victory for the world.
[03:56:38.000 --> 03:56:52.000]  This is the heart of 1776. You're a white male. It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones. Move, bitch, get out of the way.
[03:56:52.000 --> 03:56:58.000]  We pledge allegiance to one flag and that flag is the American flag.
[03:56:58.000 --> 03:57:12.000]  Info wars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter. It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning. I will not let you down. You'll be very, very impressed, I hope, and I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[03:57:12.000 --> 03:57:25.000]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones. This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States. Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones.
[03:57:43.000 --> 03:57:52.000]  I just want listeners to understand money is what allows us to beat this and stand against this. And we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the Save Info Wars 50% off.
[03:57:52.000 --> 03:58:00.000]  But we make only like $5, $10 on higher marked up stuff. We're making like $2 on the toothpaste at that price. And we're moving a ton of it, okay?
[03:58:00.000 --> 03:58:07.000]  But you move a couple hundred thousand dollars or something and you get $20,000. That doesn't pay for all the infrastructure, the bandwidth, the lawyers, the crew.
[03:58:07.000 --> 03:58:15.000]  So we need to sell millions and millions and millions of dollars a product. I want to expand that contract. And for six months, we've not just been able to stand still. The enemy's been winning.
[03:58:15.000 --> 03:58:23.000]  And I have labored and labored and labored and labored on this. I like to be expanding. I like to be winning. I like to be fighting. And we are winning the Info War. That's why we're so hated.
[03:58:23.000 --> 03:58:30.000]  But we need to be retreaded. We need to be tuned up. We need to be fixed up. We never have time to get into drive up. We got a lot of holes shot at us.
[03:58:30.000 --> 03:58:37.000]  And the enemy wants to silence us. Then they're really going to plant child porn on us. Then they're going to kill me or you or anybody else.
[03:58:37.000 --> 03:58:41.000]  I mean, the Democrats now are going into a full revolutionary fervor funded by foreign banks in the Chicombs.
[03:58:41.000 --> 03:58:44.000]  So go to infowarsstore.com.
[03:58:44.000 --> 03:58:47.000]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York. Marcus here on the air. Thanks for holding.
[03:58:47.000 --> 03:58:53.000]  Hey, Alex. Yeah, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air. I talked to a lot of people here out in New York City.
[03:58:53.000 --> 03:59:06.000]  And one thing I could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars. I think that the Neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public approaching 2020.
[03:59:06.000 --> 03:59:13.000]  That's it. I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency. It's the only way I think he could be defeated other than assassinating him. It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[03:59:13.000 --> 03:59:19.000]  I agree entirely. And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[03:59:19.000 --> 03:59:24.000]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old. I'd love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[03:59:24.000 --> 03:59:29.000]  But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war. You've won a lot of battles.
[03:59:29.000 --> 03:59:33.000]  And there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[03:59:33.000 --> 03:59:42.000]  We're going to keep fighting in the input war. And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[03:59:42.000 --> 03:59:46.000]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[03:59:46.000 --> 03:59:51.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
