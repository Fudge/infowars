[00:00:02.231 --> 00:00:08.703]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:00:38.032 --> 00:00:39.952]  I'm watching the midterms.
[00:00:39.952 --> 00:00:43.813]  Man, you would think our country is Mad Max Thunderdome.
[00:00:43.813 --> 00:00:51.474]  This guy is like, they're coming from Guatemala, they're coming from Mexico.
[00:00:51.474 --> 00:00:53.395]  There's a liberal mob that's coming.
[00:00:53.395 --> 00:00:54.095]  You want a drop?
[00:00:54.095 --> 00:00:54.995]  You want a drop?
[00:00:54.995 --> 00:00:55.175]  Yeah!
[00:00:55.175 --> 00:00:55.995]  What's up, bitch?
[00:00:55.995 --> 00:00:57.015]  What's up, bitch?
[00:00:57.015 --> 00:00:58.235]  What's up, bitch?
[00:00:58.235 --> 00:00:59.596]  What's up, bitch?
[00:00:59.596 --> 00:01:01.156]  What's up, bitch?
[00:01:01.156 --> 00:01:03.616]  What's up, bitch?
[00:01:03.616 --> 00:01:04.216]  What's up, bitch?
[00:01:04.216 --> 00:01:04.596]  What's up, bitch?
[00:01:04.596 --> 00:01:05.697]  What's up, bitch?
[00:01:05.697 --> 00:01:06.117]  What's up, bitch?
[00:01:06.117 --> 00:01:06.777]  What's up, bitch?
[00:01:06.777 --> 00:01:07.537]  Who are the presidents?
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:33.346]  And you would think everybody in the country is just like, to the bunker.
[00:01:42.583 --> 00:01:54.192]  Megamassive earthquakes are a real possibility, and in the near future, a certainty.
[00:01:54.192 --> 00:01:56.934]  World government is in crisis.
[00:01:56.934 --> 00:02:03.679]  Nation states are under assault from within and without.
[00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:07.943]  Giant pedophile rings controlling the deep state are now being exposed.
[00:02:09.841 --> 00:02:14.624]  This is one incredible time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:14.624 --> 00:02:24.989]  And I'm very honored to be here on this live Monday, July 8th, 2019 transmission.
[00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.452]  Where to start?
[00:02:29.452 --> 00:02:36.916]  I was out in the heat this morning, hiking around, and I wasn't sweating.
[00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:52.818]  But as soon as I got in here and looked at all these stories, and I've been getting ready for the broadcast since 6 a.m., off and on, I started sweating, even though it's probably 69 degrees in here, with all this equipment.
[00:02:52.818 --> 00:02:55.420]  It's a little bit hotter, all the lights.
[00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:05.326]  And that's because when you read about them keeping babies alive and selling their organs, that's back in the news, and it's being normalized, you're supposed to start sweating.
[00:03:06.783 --> 00:03:12.868]  That's your body metabolic system saying we're all under threat.
[00:03:12.868 --> 00:03:14.409]  Ever been in a slaughterhouse?
[00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:16.330]  Ever seen footage you want?
[00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.955]  The cows start freaking out, yelling, mooing as the other ones get sent down the chute.
[00:03:21.955 --> 00:03:26.518]  They get hit in the head by a big air pump jack hammer in the head.
[00:03:26.518 --> 00:03:32.043]  And then big chains haul them up by their hind legs and they get their throats slit by a big machine.
[00:03:34.568 --> 00:03:36.929]  The cows start freaking out trying to get out of there.
[00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:55.259]  Well, I'm sitting here watching a giant world government kill grid being built, and the globalists using weaponized scientific mind control to turn a large part of the population into basically undead, foaming at the mouth, anti-human zombies who walk around talking about killing children all day.
[00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:59.361]  We're in a science fiction movie, and I'm sweating.
[00:03:59.361 --> 00:03:59.701]  Sweating.
[00:04:02.802 --> 00:04:06.284]  I guess it's like a mini anxiety attack I have now.
[00:04:06.284 --> 00:04:15.129]  Every time I get in here, you're ready to go on air because my brain, my metabolic system, my central nervous system is like, you better get this right, buddy.
[00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:17.610]  Because I'm facing reality.
[00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:22.733]  I'm living in the real world.
[00:04:22.733 --> 00:04:28.296]  I was sitting out with Robert Barnes when he was here in town in 98 degree heat one afternoon at the shooting range.
[00:04:28.296 --> 00:04:31.258]  They have an outdoor smoking for cigar lounge.
[00:04:33.064 --> 00:04:36.465]  Look, you're not sweating Alex in 98 degree heat, but I'm sweating in here.
[00:04:36.465 --> 00:04:37.625]  Do you know why?
[00:04:37.625 --> 00:04:43.107]  We're in the cockpit and the energy from all of the planets flowing through and out.
[00:04:43.107 --> 00:04:49.989]  And we are at the center of the resistance for humanity to survive a pro-human future.
[00:04:49.989 --> 00:04:50.869]  Strap yourselves in.
[00:04:50.869 --> 00:04:51.890]  I'm back in 60 seconds.
[00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.610]  This is going to be one for the record books.
[00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.351]  Wait till you hear what's coming up.
[00:04:55.351 --> 00:04:55.711]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:07.085]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made, Alpha Power.

[00:05:51.655 --> 00:05:54.137]  Head to InfoWarsStore.com today.
[00:06:03.186 --> 00:06:05.848]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:05.848 --> 00:06:17.658]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:17.658 --> 00:06:29.427]  Tommy Robinson.
[00:06:31.991 --> 00:06:34.933]  Called me last week.
[00:06:34.933 --> 00:06:37.615]  And we had a private discussion.
[00:06:37.615 --> 00:06:39.316]  Came on the air Friday.
[00:06:39.316 --> 00:06:41.457]  I hosted the war room.
[00:06:41.457 --> 00:06:42.598]  With Owen Schroyer.
[00:06:42.598 --> 00:06:43.859]  And we had Tommy on for an hour.
[00:06:43.859 --> 00:06:49.583]  And he's going to be making a major announcement.
[00:06:49.583 --> 00:06:51.144]  The freedom fighter over in the UK.
[00:06:51.144 --> 00:06:54.847]  Has been imprisoned three times.
[00:06:54.847 --> 00:06:56.127]  Put in solitary confinement.
[00:06:56.127 --> 00:06:58.669]  Lost 40 pounds.
[00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:00.170]  Been tortured.
[00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:00.991]  The Islamicists have
[00:07:02.298 --> 00:07:07.600]  Threw him bleach on his face in the prison and he's marked for death.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.260]  They've told him next time they're going to kill him.
[00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:17.642]  He's been ordered to show up in court next Thursday and they're told he's going to be put in solitary confinement for up to a year.
[00:07:17.642 --> 00:07:18.183]  The crime?
[00:07:18.183 --> 00:07:25.585]  He exposed giant child kidnapping sex rings with children being killed and then chopped up into kebab meat.
[00:07:26.607 --> 00:07:30.769]  And fed to people on the streets of London and other cities.
[00:07:30.769 --> 00:07:32.790]  It's now mainstream news.
[00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:36.792]  And the British government is so evil and so pedophile filled.
[00:07:36.792 --> 00:07:39.253]  It was the Muslims were supplying them children.
[00:07:39.253 --> 00:07:42.535]  And now thousands of these Muslims have been convicted and in prison.
[00:07:42.535 --> 00:07:44.976]  They're usually only given a few months.
[00:07:44.976 --> 00:07:50.239]  And the government covers up the big Islamic joke is to sell you human meat.
[00:07:51.519 --> 00:07:53.320]  It's an Al-Qaeda ISIS thing.
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:08:03.707]  You've famously seen the footage in Libya where they would make people eat human meat from prisoners they killed before they killed them because they believe it sends them to hell.
[00:08:03.707 --> 00:08:08.390]  And so he caught them selling the kebab meat of the dead girls.
[00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:14.394]  Oh yeah, they hang them up in the back after they've, you know, raped them or whatever and let hundreds of men have sex with them.
[00:08:14.394 --> 00:08:19.578]  And the police, it turned out, in these cities will do nothing to help them because it's politically incorrect.
[00:08:20.831 --> 00:08:21.391]  To do that.
[00:08:21.391 --> 00:08:24.553]  So yeah, this sounds completely horrible.
[00:08:24.553 --> 00:08:28.016]  It sounds completely evil.
[00:08:28.016 --> 00:08:32.259]  It sounds like it's not real.
[00:08:32.259 --> 00:08:33.279]  But it is real.
[00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:35.601]  Hundreds of knife attacks a day.
[00:08:35.601 --> 00:08:38.122]  Dozens of deaths a week.
[00:08:38.122 --> 00:08:39.924]  Mass raping, mass killing.
[00:08:41.263 --> 00:09:08.159]  Because of the wonders of multiculturalism, bringing in barbarous, primitive folks from vicious countries that are ruled by kingpins and by warlords, and then bringing them into a docile, conditioned, imperially trained group of people who were once wild themselves, but now have been conditioned to submit, and it creates a nightmare situation.
[00:09:08.159 --> 00:09:10.460]  And so that's where all of this is going.
[00:09:12.964 --> 00:09:17.545]  Top liberals all over Europe are now coming out and saying, we were wrong.
[00:09:17.545 --> 00:09:19.386]  The multiculturalism didn't work.
[00:09:19.386 --> 00:09:20.726]  We're reversing it right now.
[00:09:20.726 --> 00:09:27.508]  But they're doing that, they admit, to stop a rebellion by the nation states and to stop themselves being thrown out of power.
[00:09:27.508 --> 00:09:29.368]  They're still going to keep the borders open.
[00:09:29.368 --> 00:09:33.549]  This is part of a larger plan that's all delineated.
[00:09:33.549 --> 00:09:39.271]  Now, Tommy Robinson is going to be making a major announcement
[00:09:40.578 --> 00:09:43.360]  An appeal to the President of the United States.
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.661]  This is going to be big news.
[00:09:44.661 --> 00:09:45.402]  It's very important.
[00:09:45.402 --> 00:09:47.604]  It's also very illustrative of things.
[00:09:47.604 --> 00:09:49.325]  Just wait till we get there.
[00:09:49.325 --> 00:09:52.608]  Second hour today.
[00:09:52.608 --> 00:10:07.820]  But he's only three days away, three and a half days away from being taken and being put back into an Islamic torture pit where the jail guards allow them to come to his solitary confinement cell, hang their butts into the opening,
[00:10:09.065 --> 00:10:10.866]  And defecate into his cell.
[00:10:10.866 --> 00:10:19.512]  And then up to a dozen they come by, they lift their dresses up, Islamic dresses they wear, they put their butt up to the thing, and then they defecate into his cell.
[00:10:19.512 --> 00:10:31.099]  The old guards love it, British government loves it, because he dared expose the pedophile meat wagon going right into their mouths of our children.
[00:10:31.099 --> 00:10:33.061]  Again, the Muslims are the Renfields in the UK.
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:44.985]  And any pedophilia going on in Islam, which is rampant, you know, Mohammed married his nine-year-old niece or whatever, is nothing compared to the people running the UK.
[00:10:44.985 --> 00:10:49.988]  That is pedophile central, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:49.988 --> 00:11:03.735]  Speaking of pedophile central, here's the indictment of Mr. Epstein, who was a procurer for Robert Mueller and others of blackmail.
[00:11:04.574 --> 00:11:12.840]  He ran up to 200 girls at a time, ages ranging from 17 down to 10 that we know of.
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:18.744]  And it was up to these girls to go out and find disadvantaged girls, poor girls, poor families.
[00:11:18.744 --> 00:11:26.710]  And then Epstein would give them sometimes up to $10,000 a week back to the families to rent their daughters.
[00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:28.672]  And then he would have rich men
[00:11:30.046 --> 00:11:34.510]  Onboard aircraft having sex with the children and then also flying to other facilities.
[00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:42.957]  Some of the children never showed back up, of course, because there's always a little something extra at the bottom of the rat hole, isn't there?
[00:11:42.957 --> 00:11:50.463]  And so now the media, the evil globalist disinformation factory, has come out
[00:11:52.938 --> 00:11:55.739]  And said Donald Trump is in trouble.
[00:11:55.739 --> 00:11:56.980]  This will hurt Donald Trump.
[00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:59.961]  And then they have no evidence, no statements, no nothing.
[00:11:59.961 --> 00:12:02.262]  And Donald Trump's not in the indictment.
[00:12:02.262 --> 00:12:03.622]  And no mention of Donald Trump.
[00:12:03.622 --> 00:12:20.829]  Donald Trump is now being reported in major newspapers as the only person, when Epstein originally got busted in 2009, to work with the lawyers for the victims
[00:12:22.884 --> 00:12:39.552]  And the lawyer said he was wonderful and gave them all this info and said, as much time as you need, and spent hours and hours over multiple days helping try to put Epstein under the jail.
[00:12:39.552 --> 00:12:42.193]  Because he knew him for business.
[00:12:42.193 --> 00:12:44.874]  They didn't fly on planes together, none of that.
[00:12:44.874 --> 00:12:47.496]  Trump's been to one party Epstein was at.
[00:12:47.496 --> 00:12:50.677]  And he told Roger Stone, he said, I pull up and you're like, isn't it nice?
[00:12:50.677 --> 00:12:51.978]  You let all the neighborhood kids swim here.
[00:12:53.919 --> 00:13:01.406]  And they looked around and he ran out of the house.
[00:13:01.406 --> 00:13:03.829]  Trump's the guy on his Twitter saying, execute pedophiles.
[00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:06.351]  I agree with him.
[00:13:06.351 --> 00:13:14.239]  So what happens when you're in the billionaire's club and you don't play along?
[00:13:14.239 --> 00:13:15.640]  Well, why did all this happen?
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:16.701]  The media thinks you're stupid.
[00:13:16.701 --> 00:13:17.582]  We're into this next segment.
[00:13:20.356 --> 00:13:25.379]  Because the media two years ago tried to blame Trump in time to this.
[00:13:25.379 --> 00:13:28.101]  And then they tried to blame Alan Dershowitz who had no connection to this.
[00:13:28.101 --> 00:13:31.063]  And Alan Dershowitz got pissed and sued.
[00:13:31.063 --> 00:13:36.467]  And got hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of pages that the FBI didn't want released.
[00:13:36.467 --> 00:13:38.208]  Back from the Obama days.
[00:13:38.208 --> 00:13:39.189]  And from the court case.
[00:13:39.189 --> 00:13:41.430]  And it's the flight manifestos.
[00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:42.451]  And it's the background.
[00:13:42.451 --> 00:13:43.391]  And it's all of it.
[00:13:43.391 --> 00:13:50.036]  Now the indictment is designed at a limited level to contain this information.
[00:13:51.403 --> 00:14:11.798]  And you've got one of the prosecutors involved is Comey's daughter, so they've got their deep state people in there trying to contain this, but the judge did the right thing, ordered it released, and it's incredible information because you're not supposed to, in a flight manifest,
[00:14:12.734 --> 00:14:14.475]  Only put the initials of people on board the plane.
[00:14:14.475 --> 00:14:25.384]  You're supposed to put their full names, their driver's license number, their social security number, and you have to call ahead on each one, and it's cleared for takeoff by Homeland Security since 9-11.
[00:14:25.384 --> 00:14:30.048]  That was in place a week after 9-11, 18 years ago.
[00:14:30.048 --> 00:14:40.276]  This is Clinton, 20 plus times on the manifest, reportedly hundreds of times he wasn't, flying to Europe, to the Middle East, to known pedophiles,
[00:14:41.690 --> 00:15:11.401]  facilities where these islamicists have whole harems of little kids so these people are the worst demons that anyone can imagine and yes they even had a temple for having sex with the children on this lolita express island so you need to understand these are these are psychic vampires who are draining the energy off people
[00:15:13.237 --> 00:15:20.381]  And that's what they do on board, these passenger-sized jets, large jets.
[00:15:20.381 --> 00:15:26.664]  And then the media always whitewashes it and shows you, oh, a girl started when she was 15, but now she's 18.
[00:15:26.664 --> 00:15:32.207]  It's far worse than all of that, OK?
[00:15:32.207 --> 00:15:37.310]  And this means Trump's taking the gloves off, and they are really, really scared.
[00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:38.731]  This is a big deal.
[00:15:38.731 --> 00:15:40.532]  Also, Carpe Danktum, who
[00:15:41.678 --> 00:15:47.004]  Made a little surprise visit to the White House, had a 20 minute conversation with the President.
[00:15:47.004 --> 00:15:55.293]  He's going to be joining us in the third hour with a lot of interesting information and a first look at this big summit coming up in D.C.

[00:17:01.653 --> 00:17:10.039]  If you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[00:17:10.199 --> 00:17:19.506]  Bill Hyde here, and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX Microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[00:17:19.506 --> 00:17:24.789]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[00:17:24.789 --> 00:17:36.998]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location, and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[00:17:36.998 --> 00:17:38.239]  So here's what you should do right now.
[00:17:38.239 --> 00:17:40.040]  Check out the PPX Microgrid system.
[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:40.960]  That's right.
[00:18:00.472 --> 00:18:01.793]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[00:18:01.793 --> 00:18:02.573]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[00:18:02.573 --> 00:18:03.153]  Thanks for holding.
[00:18:03.153 --> 00:18:03.474]  Hey, Alex.
[00:18:03.474 --> 00:18:06.495]  Yeah, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air.
[00:18:06.495 --> 00:18:12.599]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City, and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[00:18:12.599 --> 00:18:21.344]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public approaching 2020.
[00:18:21.344 --> 00:18:22.564]  That's it.
[00:18:22.564 --> 00:18:25.226]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[00:18:25.226 --> 00:18:28.067]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[00:18:28.067 --> 00:18:29.348]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[00:18:29.508 --> 00:18:30.268]  I agree entirely.
[00:18:30.268 --> 00:18:35.711]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[00:18:35.711 --> 00:18:38.493]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[00:18:38.493 --> 00:18:40.574]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[00:18:40.574 --> 00:18:49.818]  But if they do shut you down, know you've gone into this war, you've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[00:18:49.818 --> 00:18:51.719]  We're going to keep fighting in the info war.
[00:18:51.719 --> 00:18:58.202]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[00:18:58.202 --> 00:18:59.143]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[00:19:01.425 --> 00:19:18.091]  I talk about this on the air, and I know it sinks into people, but I've decided that we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements, in that if you go back five, six years ago, before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it, I would talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were, and I'd have doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good.
[00:19:18.091 --> 00:19:25.514]  And instead, the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us, or they'll shut us down, and the biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful they were.
[00:19:25.874 --> 00:19:27.635]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[00:19:27.635 --> 00:19:31.877]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements.
[00:19:31.877 --> 00:19:39.820]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:47.424]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them, and all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things.
[00:19:47.424 --> 00:19:48.605]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[00:19:48.605 --> 00:19:49.445]  They have side effects.
[00:19:49.605 --> 00:19:54.187]  Not with Mother Nature, but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest.
[00:19:54.187 --> 00:19:55.247]  Infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:19:55.247 --> 00:19:57.068]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:26.698 --> 00:20:28.500]  Bill Clinton.
[00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:30.662]  Nice guy.
[00:20:30.662 --> 00:20:35.586]  Got a lot of problems coming up, in my opinion, with the famous island with Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:20:35.586 --> 00:20:42.752]  A lot of problems.
[00:20:42.752 --> 00:20:47.237]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have evidence of massive crimes.
[00:20:47.237 --> 00:20:53.022]  The entire deep state system operates on secret forms of currency.
[00:20:55.126 --> 00:21:05.432]  Arms, drugs, stolen art, rare coins, jewels, are the underground economy currency.
[00:21:05.432 --> 00:21:19.161]  But now, even Senate reports confirm, in many areas of the world, human trafficking, including sex trafficking of small children who were killed in snuff films, their organs harvested.
[00:21:20.006 --> 00:21:23.347]  After their heads are blown off with .357 Magnums.
[00:21:23.347 --> 00:21:25.247]  This is in the law enforcement reports.
[00:21:25.247 --> 00:21:26.927]  This is the stuff the FBI has to look at.
[00:21:26.927 --> 00:21:29.968]  The real stuff on the dark web.
[00:21:29.968 --> 00:21:33.508]  Toddlers being gang raped by men having their heads blown off.
[00:21:33.508 --> 00:21:37.989]  Remember, that's who wants to run your life.
[00:21:37.989 --> 00:21:43.730]  Sorry to have to talk like that, but this isn't just a bunch of old rich men having sex with 15-year-old girls.
[00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:44.410]  That's bad enough.
[00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:47.951]  This is blowing children's brains out.
[00:21:50.046 --> 00:21:51.468]  You understand?
[00:21:51.468 --> 00:21:52.669]  You're like, really?
[00:21:52.669 --> 00:21:54.071]  Yeah, I noticed that.
[00:21:54.071 --> 00:21:55.772]  Playing with dead babies.
[00:21:55.772 --> 00:21:58.736]  Throwing dead babies around like footballs.
[00:21:58.736 --> 00:22:00.978]  Talking about how they love Satanism.
[00:22:00.978 --> 00:22:01.719]  Eating the babies.
[00:22:01.719 --> 00:22:07.926]  These are things that abortionists have been convicted of doing because their own employees go public.
[00:22:07.926 --> 00:22:11.130]  Having sex with the dead bodies, sometimes for weeks.
[00:22:13.564 --> 00:22:19.528]  Killing children, putting them in refrigerator trucks, and delivering them to people to have sex with the dead bodies.
[00:22:19.528 --> 00:22:23.510]  I'm telling you some of the stuff that was confirmed with Jimmy Savelle.
[00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:25.472]  I'm sorry this is so horrible.
[00:22:25.472 --> 00:22:28.374]  It's real!
[00:22:28.374 --> 00:22:29.754]  And this is what Hollywood is.
[00:22:29.754 --> 00:22:35.938]  Purely demonic, purely evil, a black hole to another dimension, to hell.
[00:22:35.938 --> 00:22:39.301]  It's open on our West Coast.
[00:22:39.301 --> 00:22:41.262]  It's open in London, England.
[00:22:42.938 --> 00:22:49.321]  Is open in Paris, France.
[00:22:49.321 --> 00:22:53.442]  Gates to hell.
[00:22:53.442 --> 00:23:05.207]  And I have stacks of news confirming Fusion GPS, the fake Russia gate dossier, tried to link Trump to Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:23:05.207 --> 00:23:07.828]  But he had no connections like the Clintons and everybody else.
[00:23:09.454 --> 00:23:17.619]  And so now the corporate media adds to all this evil by lying and saying, ooh, Trump's in trouble.
[00:23:17.619 --> 00:23:21.902]  Trump's going to be connected to it.
[00:23:21.902 --> 00:23:24.124]  Think about that.
[00:23:24.124 --> 00:23:25.225]  Think about that.
[00:23:25.225 --> 00:23:29.648]  They're now openly defending the pedophile rings.
[00:23:29.648 --> 00:23:30.528]  But they've always been doing it.
[00:23:30.528 --> 00:23:33.070]  Remember I said Trump was going to bust the pedophile rings wide open?
[00:23:34.929 --> 00:23:46.837]  And notice you've seen a multi-thousand percent increase, a tenfold increase in arrest, prosecution, and conviction of pedophiles.
[00:23:46.837 --> 00:23:52.421]  And because he was at parties with Epstein and in some business deals with him, Trump does thousands of those a year.
[00:23:52.421 --> 00:23:54.322]  Oh, he's with Epstein.
[00:23:57.714 --> 00:24:04.536]  Meanwhile, we have the aircraft manifest of Bill Clinton flying with little children, little girls, and the initials.
[00:24:04.536 --> 00:24:11.277]  When the Secret Service made an issue about it, what did Bill Clinton do?
[00:24:11.277 --> 00:24:16.198]  He stopped carrying the Secret Service with him when he went on those aircraft with those children.
[00:24:16.198 --> 00:24:18.579]  That's what Don Bongino talked about a few years ago.
[00:24:18.579 --> 00:24:20.059]  He said, watch out, Hillary.
[00:24:20.059 --> 00:24:22.320]  Don't run your mouth.
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:25.541]  We all know who's really with Epstein and the little kids.
[00:24:25.541 --> 00:24:26.341]  Don't poke the bear.
[00:24:28.131 --> 00:24:35.533]  Well, the bear got poked, and here's a OAN Jack Posobiec report on the latest information.
[00:24:35.533 --> 00:24:35.754]  Here it is.
[00:24:36.536 --> 00:24:47.404]  Former President Bill Clinton is keeping silent on his close relationship to a convicted sex offender as renewed attention is pinned on his long history of sexual misconduct allegations.
[00:24:47.404 --> 00:24:55.849]  The Clinton Presidential Library refused to respond to a request submitted last week seeking information on Clinton's close ties with billionaire Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:24:55.849 --> 00:25:00.293]  Do you solemnly swear the testimony you're about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
[00:25:00.293 --> 00:25:00.653]  Yes, I do.
[00:25:01.053 --> 00:25:10.719]  Epstein was convicted for soliciting sex from underage girls as young as 14 back in 2008, to which he served a short 13-month prison sentence.
[00:25:10.719 --> 00:25:20.084]  According to reports, Epstein used his private jet, dubbed as the Lolita Express, to fly his friends around where they were offered sex with underage girls.
[00:25:20.084 --> 00:25:29.389]  The Boeing 727 jet was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had grouped sex on during the flights, which was verified by an air hostess back in 2015.
[00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:34.275]  Did you ever think that maybe more was going on than simple massages?
[00:25:34.275 --> 00:25:36.177]  Looking back, of course.
[00:25:36.177 --> 00:25:37.920]  Was there a bed on the airplane?
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:39.201]  Actually, yes, there was.
[00:25:39.201 --> 00:25:45.609]  According to flight records, Bill Clinton traveled with Epstein on board the Lolita Express a total of 26 times from 2001 to 2003.
[00:25:48.593 --> 00:25:58.087]  Flight logs indicate only the first names of the female passengers were listed on the flights Clinton took, and show he ditched his Secret Service detail on five of the trips.
[00:25:58.087 --> 00:26:04.376]  On one of the flights, Clinton was joined by actor Kevin Spacey, who is now accused of sexual misconduct with an underage boy.
[00:26:04.696 --> 00:26:16.084]  Epstein's assistant, Sarah Kellen, was accused in court filings of recruiting and grooming underage girls to perform sex acts with the billionaire and his friends, and sometimes participated in the alleged acts.
[00:26:16.084 --> 00:26:20.047]  She traveled with Clinton on as many as 11 of the flights that he took.
[00:26:20.047 --> 00:26:33.216]  According to reports, Epstein would also fly his friends to his private 72-acre island in the Virgin Islands, where a team of human traffickers allegedly rounded up girls as young as 12 to service Epstein and his friends during their visit.
[00:26:33.556 --> 00:26:36.701]  It is unclear if Clinton ever visited the island.
[00:26:36.701 --> 00:26:47.015]  In 2015, Judicial Watch submitted a request to the Department of Homeland Security to obtain records of Secret Service expenses used by Clinton during his trips with Epstein.
[00:26:47.015 --> 00:26:50.340]  According to the watchdog group, the department never handed over the record.
[00:26:52.324 --> 00:26:53.684]  So there you go, Jack.
[00:26:53.684 --> 00:26:54.485]  Somebody tweeted that out.
[00:26:54.485 --> 00:26:56.445]  That's from the One American News Network.
[00:26:56.445 --> 00:26:57.205]  Doing a great job.
[00:26:57.205 --> 00:27:04.867]  I think you're going to be seeing the President promote more and more now that Fox is sliding, like they did last election, towards the left.
[00:27:04.867 --> 00:27:05.487]  Wow.
[00:27:05.487 --> 00:27:07.308]  What a time to be alive.
[00:27:07.308 --> 00:27:09.388]  We're going to get more into this when we come back.
[00:27:09.388 --> 00:27:19.231]  I'm going to go through the documents, through the history, and the fact that you can't take a step if you're around the Clintons and not run into a convicted child trafficker or child rapist.
[00:27:20.347 --> 00:27:27.476]  Again, one of the deputy heads of her foundation got caught smuggling kids in and a bunch of them disappeared and were found dead.
[00:27:27.476 --> 00:27:32.743]  She changed her name and works for the group that gives the data to Amber Alert.
[00:27:32.743 --> 00:27:35.827]  They want to keep tabs on the children, don't they?
[00:27:35.827 --> 00:27:38.190]  So, you have to understand, this is their currency.
[00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:43.733]  There's over four billion dollars a year in the Senate reports as of 2018.
[00:27:43.733 --> 00:27:45.935]  The numbers are always a year old.
[00:27:45.935 --> 00:27:52.681]  Four billion a year paid to the drug cartels just to smuggle people across the border.
[00:27:52.681 --> 00:27:58.086]  Many of them children, one-third of those not with a genetic relative.
[00:27:58.086 --> 00:28:00.127]  They're kidnapped.
[00:28:00.127 --> 00:28:05.472]  But the left says we're putting them in cages, we're torturing them, we're the Nazis.
[00:28:05.472 --> 00:28:06.153]  And the truth is
[00:28:07.318 --> 00:28:08.720]  They want that fresh meat.
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.122]  They want that fresh blood.
[00:28:10.122 --> 00:28:15.529]  They want unidentified children so they can snuff film them, torture them, and drink their blood.
[00:28:15.529 --> 00:28:16.190]  Now watch!
[00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:16.971]  It's all coming out.
[00:28:16.971 --> 00:28:17.691]  You're going to see it.
[00:28:17.691 --> 00:28:20.515]  They drain children's blood.
[00:28:20.515 --> 00:28:22.758]  They drink children's blood.
[00:28:22.758 --> 00:28:24.580]  They kill babies after they're born.
[00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:25.502]  They keep them alive.
[00:28:26.892 --> 00:28:32.515]  I was talking to an RN nurse, just a month ago, in my kitchen, and she goes, yeah, how do you know about that?
[00:28:32.515 --> 00:28:40.539]  We keep, yeah, she goes, I don't work in that area, but there's a special wing where they keep the babies alive, and the organ donors, so they can get the organs.
[00:28:40.539 --> 00:28:42.080]  I go, yeah, keep them alive, right?
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:42.360]  Why?
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:47.783]  Well, because we get more money that way, being able to, you know, have it on the market.
[00:28:47.783 --> 00:28:51.485]  I'm like, yeah, and she started shaking, and never even thought.
[00:28:51.485 --> 00:28:52.526]  Murdering babies!
[00:28:52.526 --> 00:28:53.146]  Murder!
[00:28:53.146 --> 00:28:53.907]  Satanism!
[00:28:53.907 --> 00:28:54.687]  Breaking blood!
[00:28:54.687 --> 00:28:56.048]  Blowing their heads off!
[00:28:56.048 --> 00:28:56.348]  Got it?
[00:28:59.636 --> 00:29:01.597]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:29:01.597 --> 00:29:06.899]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:29:06.899 --> 00:29:08.499]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:29:08.499 --> 00:29:16.843]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:29:16.843 --> 00:29:22.525]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:29:22.705 --> 00:29:24.526]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:29:24.526 --> 00:29:26.807]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:29:26.807 --> 00:29:31.189]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:29:31.189 --> 00:29:33.390]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[00:30:01.911 --> 00:30:06.035]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:30:06.035 --> 00:30:09.178]  Viewers and listeners, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.
[00:30:09.178 --> 00:30:12.361]  And we're under unprecedented evil attacks as you've seen.
[00:30:12.361 --> 00:30:24.572]  But I wanted to take just a minute out here from the bottom of my heart to tell you how much it means to me that when you saw those lies against us last week, the worst things you can say about people that you knew they were liars, you went and looked it up and found out the truth.
[00:30:24.572 --> 00:30:25.153]  And so I feel
[00:30:25.373 --> 00:30:29.695]  Very strong, and I feel God's hand on my shoulder, and I feel your love in my heart.
[00:30:29.695 --> 00:30:31.455]  And I want you to know that love is right back at you.
[00:30:31.455 --> 00:30:39.379]  And I want to thank you for all you've done with your word of mouth and your prayers and your financial support, because I'm committed to fight to the end, but I want to win.
[00:30:39.379 --> 00:30:43.020]  And without you, I'm going to be destroyed, and it's not going to be fun.
[00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:44.421]  But that's not what's important.
[00:30:44.421 --> 00:30:45.621]  The enemy could win.
[00:30:45.621 --> 00:30:47.762]  We're a key chess piece in this fight.
[00:30:47.762 --> 00:30:48.983]  We're being used by God.
[00:30:48.983 --> 00:30:50.223]  You're being used by God.
[00:30:50.223 --> 00:30:51.143]  This is providence.
[00:30:51.143 --> 00:30:54.665]  So I salute you, and I thank you for all you've done from the bottom of my heart.
[00:31:00.348 --> 00:31:04.530]  The Globalists are hyper-competitive, scientific dictators.
[00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:05.591]  They are technocrats.
[00:31:05.591 --> 00:31:07.872]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[00:31:07.872 --> 00:31:14.756]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life, make your own decisions, gets in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[00:31:15.316 --> 00:31:17.098]  We're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[00:31:17.098 --> 00:31:19.580]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:26.065]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[00:31:26.065 --> 00:31:31.250]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4warslife.com, I couldn't do it.
[00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:40.277]  That's why we decided to take our original secret 12 that was incredibly high quality medical bottlemen and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[00:31:41.238 --> 00:31:47.220]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over-the-counter that you're going to find anywhere.
[00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:48.160]  It is amazing.

[00:32:00.802 --> 00:32:02.743]  Briefly, folks, please do not forget.
[00:32:02.743 --> 00:32:03.924]  This is the maximum alert.
[00:32:03.924 --> 00:32:05.085]  We wouldn't be here without you.
[00:32:05.085 --> 00:32:06.486]  I thank you for your support and your help.
[00:32:06.486 --> 00:32:12.770]  We're going to be steadfast in this fight, but we need financial support, and we're going to put up more prominent donate buttons at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:14.651]  You want to just give us straight donations.
[00:32:14.651 --> 00:32:15.192]  There's a P.O.
[00:32:15.192 --> 00:32:16.453]  box if you want to mail us a check.
[00:32:16.453 --> 00:32:18.254]  We will put it into the fight against these globalists.
[00:32:18.254 --> 00:32:19.715]  We need money to fight back.
[00:32:19.855 --> 00:32:25.439]  And to let them know we're taking action and to defend ourselves, InfoWarsStore.com is the main page.

[00:32:40.911 --> 00:32:43.433]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:19.281 --> 00:33:21.743]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:21.743 --> 00:33:23.064]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:59.785]  I want everybody to understand something if you just tuned in earlier.
[00:33:59.785 --> 00:34:03.550]  You heard me talking about what they do to children.
[00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:06.073]  I've been on air 25 years.
[00:34:06.073 --> 00:34:10.078]  And I have read hundreds of thousands of articles.
[00:34:10.078 --> 00:34:12.882]  And I have read news out of Europe, out of Russia, and out of the U.S.
[00:34:16.181 --> 00:34:22.084]  It's normally in law enforcement publications, but it deals with evidence that comes out of trials.
[00:34:22.084 --> 00:34:25.526]  And most of this never gets put on the news because the left wants to cover up.
[00:34:25.526 --> 00:34:35.451]  Their religion is aborting babies, killing babies, damaging children, having sex with children, brainwashing children, poisoning children.
[00:34:37.577 --> 00:34:49.303]  And when I was telling you about some of the stuff I said, that's in FBI reports, that's in convicted criminals and killers cases.
[00:34:49.303 --> 00:34:57.748]  I mean, I could go on for hours describing the stuff they do to children, and it's gotten to the point where when I see the articles most of the time, I can't even make myself read it.
[00:34:57.748 --> 00:35:00.589]  So it's not like I'm up here exaggerating this.
[00:35:00.589 --> 00:35:04.491]  The truth is, I know why people can't deal with this.
[00:35:04.491 --> 00:35:05.032]  It's because
[00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:10.503]  It's frightening that there are the equivalent of real vampires.
[00:35:10.503 --> 00:35:11.704]  This isn't Salem's Lot.
[00:35:11.704 --> 00:35:13.486]  This isn't Count Dracula.
[00:35:13.486 --> 00:35:24.935]  This is psychotic, demon-possessed people roaming the earth, supplying children to people even more evil.
[00:35:24.935 --> 00:35:26.696]  And they harvest their organs.
[00:35:26.696 --> 00:35:30.419]  The more they can defile a child, the better.
[00:35:30.419 --> 00:35:32.201]  The more satanic energy they get.
[00:35:34.502 --> 00:35:38.863]  So it's not enough that they just torture him and make him beg for mommy.
[00:35:38.863 --> 00:35:41.304]  Then they bleed him out.
[00:35:41.304 --> 00:35:43.125]  Then they drink their blood.
[00:35:43.125 --> 00:35:50.427]  In other cases, 20 men rape two-year-old boys and girls while they scream for mommy.
[00:35:50.427 --> 00:35:52.447]  Then they take a .357 and blow their heads off.
[00:35:52.447 --> 00:35:57.109]  That's what goes on in Italy and snuff made in Russia.
[00:35:58.632 --> 00:36:09.922]  And do you know who the number one connoisseurs and people that are consuming this?
[00:36:09.922 --> 00:36:12.484]  You know what that is?
[00:36:12.484 --> 00:36:18.168]  It's Los Angeles and San Francisco and Seattle.
[00:36:18.168 --> 00:36:25.194]  In the cases where they only make, say, 100 VHS videotapes.
[00:36:25.194 --> 00:36:26.015]  Or they put it on 8mm.
[00:36:29.383 --> 00:36:36.548]  And these people have snuff viewing parties, where they then recruit people in that actually want to be part of it.
[00:36:36.548 --> 00:36:41.431]  That's how all this stuff is like gateway drugs.
[00:36:41.431 --> 00:36:48.035]  Now we need to play that Tom DeLay 12 perversions piece that got him thrown in prison.
[00:36:48.035 --> 00:36:52.938]  They tried to throw him in prison, took all the money he had, did get put in jail for a while.
[00:36:52.938 --> 00:36:53.299]  Remember that?
[00:36:54.275 --> 00:36:56.637]  The Republican leader that was exposing the pedophile rings?
[00:36:56.637 --> 00:36:57.918]  Throw his ass in jail.
[00:36:57.918 --> 00:37:00.380]  But see, they're not on top anymore.
[00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:02.302]  They're this close to going down.
[00:37:02.302 --> 00:37:05.765]  And we have to be ready to admit what they've done.
[00:37:05.765 --> 00:37:10.149]  Oh yeah, the Nexium trial.
[00:37:10.149 --> 00:37:12.991]  I mean, put that back on screen.
[00:37:12.991 --> 00:37:14.052]  What came out in the trial?
[00:37:14.052 --> 00:37:17.355]  That they watched snuff films.
[00:37:17.355 --> 00:37:18.716]  And what were the snuff films of?
[00:37:22.688 --> 00:37:24.889]  What were the snuff films of?
[00:37:24.889 --> 00:37:28.370]  You guessed it!
[00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:31.350]  You guessed it!
[00:37:31.350 --> 00:37:40.613]  You see, liberal satanic women, they like to see pretty women killed, and they like to see little boys killed.
[00:37:40.613 --> 00:37:47.515]  That's why the average leftist mother puts their child on Prozac, Ritalin, and they end up trying to institutionalize their boys.
[00:37:47.515 --> 00:37:48.575]  It's a satanic demon.
[00:37:49.734 --> 00:37:53.998]  That Munchausen, by prophecy, wants to hurt that little boy.
[00:37:53.998 --> 00:38:01.864]  And the woman may not even know that she's demon possessed, but these women, you see their sons, they look like their souls have been sucked.
[00:38:01.864 --> 00:38:09.610]  It's like all the quote, lesbians that adopt children or steal them from their ex-husband and then chop their genitals off.
[00:38:09.610 --> 00:38:10.551]  That's a trend.
[00:38:10.551 --> 00:38:15.675]  That's not just in the case that was in Brazil last week.
[00:38:15.675 --> 00:38:15.955]  You see?
[00:38:17.967 --> 00:38:32.541]  Defiling little girls and defiling little boys and hurting them is an affront to God and is the ultimate sin, the thing God hates more than anything.
[00:38:32.541 --> 00:38:36.165]  And so if you're going to serve Satan, you might as well go all the way, right?
[00:38:36.165 --> 00:38:39.968]  So all of you leftists listening, you wonder why you have empty cursed lives.
[00:38:39.968 --> 00:38:41.470]  You come from cursed bloodlines.
[00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:42.371]  You come from weak people.
[00:38:43.619 --> 00:38:47.141]  And you think if you get rid of the good, you'll suddenly be on top.
[00:38:47.141 --> 00:38:52.383]  No, you'll just be even more in the dark.
[00:38:52.383 --> 00:38:59.847]  Now they're showing Tony Podesta stuff that, again, it's high magic to them.
[00:38:59.847 --> 00:39:01.827]  They're all in the occult.
[00:39:01.827 --> 00:39:09.071]  When Tony Podesta in 2007 had a full cover page in the local Washington Post
[00:39:10.296 --> 00:39:27.740]  about his deviant art and his dungeon basement and now he's proud of this giant collection of pedophile artwork depicting children chained up in dungeons bleeding out of their orifices.
[00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:30.080]  You say, well why would they put in the Washington Post?
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:32.341]  Why would they have Desmond is Amazing doing all this?
[00:39:32.341 --> 00:39:35.382]  Why would they have major articles saying pedophilia is good?
[00:39:35.382 --> 00:39:36.702]  They're normalizing it
[00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:48.127]  They're getting you ready so that when it really comes out, when they get caught, it's like, oh, 3,000 priests in Pennsylvania alone rape children.
[00:39:48.127 --> 00:39:50.709]  Oh, what's in the actual conviction reports?
[00:39:50.709 --> 00:39:54.651]  What's in the actual indictments?
[00:39:54.651 --> 00:39:58.714]  Hundreds of priests detailing, well, we did satanic rituals.
[00:39:58.714 --> 00:40:05.579]  And we'd take the little six, seven, eight-year-old, 10-year-old boys, and we would do a satanic ritual where 20 of us had sex with them.
[00:40:06.527 --> 00:40:12.510]  And they would say, you now take the blood of Christ, and they would pump HIV into them.
[00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:30.919]  You have to understand that on the altar, in the Catholic churches, and then it's just a little blurb, oh, here's the indictments, here's the witnesses, here's the conviction, here's the state police report, here's the FBI report, and it's just so horrible that they go, well, we can't arrest 3,000 priests.
[00:40:34.537 --> 00:40:36.598]  And it's beyond anything you've ever heard of in a movie.
[00:40:36.598 --> 00:40:39.459]  And it's just kind of a blurb, just a little blip.
[00:40:39.459 --> 00:40:45.142]  Oh, they have satanic rituals every Saturday night, every Friday night down at the Catholic Church.
[00:40:45.142 --> 00:40:48.444]  All the little old ladies come in during the week, think they're doing good stuff.
[00:40:48.444 --> 00:40:52.266]  Meanwhile, it's not Catholics doing it, it's Satanists that took the church over.
[00:40:52.266 --> 00:40:54.267]  And not all churches are doing this, but I'd say
[00:40:55.871 --> 00:40:57.793]  Satan targets churches.
[00:40:57.793 --> 00:41:08.782]  I'd say half the churches, whether they're Catholic or Protestant, are chaired by a devout Satanist who carries out satanic rituals daily.
[00:41:08.782 --> 00:41:11.104]  You can go to these churches, you can feel it, boy.
[00:41:11.104 --> 00:41:18.751]  These big megachurches are chaired by devils to make sure they take the entire world down.
[00:41:21.158 --> 00:41:22.739]  And it's all in your face.
[00:41:22.739 --> 00:41:25.419]  The UN building was pledged to Lucifer in New York City.
[00:41:25.419 --> 00:41:26.800]  Go to the chapel and read it on the wall.
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:33.962]  It says this building is dedicated to Lucifer.
[00:41:33.962 --> 00:41:45.386]  The Louvre was dedicated to Lucifer by Francois Mitterrand when they opened the new pink pyramid with 666 pieces of glass.
[00:41:45.386 --> 00:41:48.147]  This is a satanic revolution we're facing.
[00:41:49.858 --> 00:41:59.463]  And then, when we have hundreds of thousands of people pouring across that we catch every month, six-fold what ever happened.
[00:41:59.463 --> 00:42:01.004]  They're rushing our borders.
[00:42:01.004 --> 00:42:02.685]  Trump gets blamed for the crisis the U.N.
[00:42:02.685 --> 00:42:04.566]  and others set up.
[00:42:04.566 --> 00:42:07.728]  And again, hundreds of thousands of children a year come across.
[00:42:07.728 --> 00:42:10.790]  Many of them disappear and they're not with their parents and they end up dead.
[00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:15.513]  That's in Senate reports.
[00:42:15.513 --> 00:42:19.395]  And so, Trump tries to get more funding so we can find out who these kids are.
[00:42:20.427 --> 00:42:27.334]  And the media and AOC, that demon drug addict, Crip Keeper.
[00:42:27.334 --> 00:42:31.679]  She goes, they're drinking out of toilets being mean to them!
[00:42:31.679 --> 00:42:32.920]  These racists!
[00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:34.062]  KKK!
[00:42:34.062 --> 00:42:39.247]  Because her bosses are saying, you break that border, you get us those kids!
[00:42:39.247 --> 00:42:40.789]  We're paying top dollar!
[00:42:42.523 --> 00:42:45.366]  Because they need the satanic power they believe to overthrow America.
[00:42:45.366 --> 00:42:48.468]  So the child sacrifice reportedly is off the charts right now.
[00:42:48.468 --> 00:42:50.790]  They're killing kids every five minutes.
[00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:51.731]  Torturing them.
[00:42:51.731 --> 00:42:52.912]  Pulling their guts out.
[00:42:52.912 --> 00:42:54.654]  Having them beg for mommy.
[00:42:54.654 --> 00:42:57.016]  They got their engines turned up on full.
[00:42:57.016 --> 00:42:58.037]  What are we gonna do about it?
[00:42:59.890 --> 00:43:15.753]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena, in the public square, the other thing that's unique about InfoWars is it is the only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed by some billionaire, that's not being funded by a secret foreign government.
[00:43:15.753 --> 00:43:17.474]  It is completely independent of all that.
[00:43:17.474 --> 00:43:28.356]  It is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of the press and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country, they actually tried to
[00:43:28.556 --> 00:43:29.357]  We're good to go.
[00:43:58.476 --> 00:43:59.977]  We're good to go.
[00:44:20.049 --> 00:44:31.538]  Fearlessly, I'm loving every minute of this because I know I'm getting under their skin, I'm bloodying them up politically, I'm banging heads with them, and they can't help but attack back with lies and that just brings more people here.
[00:44:31.538 --> 00:44:37.223]  So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you and I need war bonds, I need gas, I need ammo politically now!
[00:44:37.603 --> 00:44:43.905]  But literally, if you flood us with money, and if you flood us with product purchases, and if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable.
[00:44:43.905 --> 00:44:45.025]  We're unstoppable together.
[00:44:45.025 --> 00:44:46.425]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy.
[00:44:46.425 --> 00:44:53.467]  I want to raise a couple million dollars, right now, to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing, and that you will stand with us, and I will never back down.
[00:44:53.467 --> 00:44:54.448]  You have my commitment.
[00:44:54.448 --> 00:44:58.789]  This only gives me more energy, and more understanding of what we're facing, and that we were right about this.
[00:45:01.414 --> 00:45:03.436]  Robert Moritz, what has Big Tech become?
[00:45:03.436 --> 00:45:05.458]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies.
[00:45:05.458 --> 00:45:11.963]  And the way they did so is because they face no consequence, social, economic, political, or legal, for their illicit activities over two decades.
[00:45:11.963 --> 00:45:24.034]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this, have to bring real social, political, economic consequence to their course of conduct.
[00:45:24.034 --> 00:45:25.215]  Otherwise, they will never change.
[00:45:25.495 --> 00:45:27.837]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening.
[00:45:55.434 --> 00:45:57.235]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting.
[00:45:57.235 --> 00:45:59.135]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[00:45:59.135 --> 00:46:00.415]  Even it is what you just saw.
[00:46:00.415 --> 00:46:06.157]  I just want listeners to understand, money is what allows us to beat this and stand against this.
[00:46:06.157 --> 00:46:13.799]  And we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the Save Info Wars 50% off, but we make only like $5, $10 on higher marked up stuff.
[00:46:13.799 --> 00:46:15.960]  We're making like $2 on the toothpaste at that price.
[00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:16.680]  And we're moving at
[00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:18.100]  I don't know.
[00:46:36.485 --> 00:46:37.446]  I like to be expanding.
[00:46:37.446 --> 00:46:38.207]  I like to be winning.
[00:46:38.207 --> 00:46:38.927]  I like to be fighting.
[00:46:38.927 --> 00:46:40.128]  And we are winning the M4 War.
[00:46:40.128 --> 00:46:40.989]  That's why we're so hated.
[00:46:40.989 --> 00:46:42.630]  But we need to be retreaded.
[00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:43.811]  We need to be tuned up.
[00:46:43.811 --> 00:46:44.892]  We need to be fixed up.
[00:46:44.892 --> 00:46:46.213]  We never had time to get in a drive-down.
[00:46:46.213 --> 00:46:47.754]  We got a lot of holes shot at us.
[00:46:47.754 --> 00:46:52.598]  And if the enemy wants to silence us, then they're really going to plant child porn on us.
[00:46:52.598 --> 00:46:54.600]  Then they're going to kill me, or you, or anybody else.
[00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:58.883]  I mean, the Democrats now are going into a full revolutionary fervor, funded by foreign banks and the TICOM.
[00:46:58.883 --> 00:47:00.545]  So, go to M4WarStore.com.
[00:47:03.369 --> 00:47:06.031]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:41.266 --> 00:47:47.391]  Ladies and gentlemen, you know, I almost want to apologize for covering all these horrible topics here, but it's got to be done.
[00:47:47.391 --> 00:47:51.735]  That's how evil operates, is in the shadows.
[00:47:51.735 --> 00:47:56.299]  Tommy Robinson's got a huge global announcement and a direct message to President Trump.
[00:47:56.299 --> 00:48:00.202]  And I'm going to let him basically host the next hour, so we can go through all of this.
[00:48:00.202 --> 00:48:02.624]  But just tell everyone you know, tune in right now.
[00:48:02.624 --> 00:48:05.106]  That's how we're overpowering the censors.
[00:48:05.106 --> 00:48:07.348]  It's how we are, word of mouth, crushing the globalists.
[00:48:08.251 --> 00:48:11.214]  They're pulling out every stop, every one of their operatives against us.
[00:48:11.214 --> 00:48:16.158]  But you, and your prayers, and your support, are incredible.
[00:48:16.158 --> 00:48:18.320]  So the article is posted on newswars.com.
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:21.503]  Please share it on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, everywhere else.
[00:48:21.503 --> 00:48:26.047]  You do not want to miss this special broadcast, huge Trump developments and more.
[00:48:26.047 --> 00:48:26.808]  Carpe Dantum.
[00:48:28.294 --> 00:48:38.258]  Is it just getting invited with over a hundred people that are libertarians, conservatives, Christian media that are successful in social media and memes?
[00:48:38.258 --> 00:48:39.438]  It's really a meme conference.
[00:48:39.438 --> 00:48:42.239]  They're calling it a social media conference.
[00:48:42.239 --> 00:48:46.040]  He was at the White House last week.
[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:47.261]  I have some of the photos of that.
[00:48:47.261 --> 00:48:51.722]  I'm not going to get into a lot of what he and Trump talked about.
[00:48:51.722 --> 00:48:56.444]  We had a discussion about it, but I've talked to other folks that have also had long conversations with Trump.
[00:48:57.504 --> 00:49:01.287]  Confirming where his mind is, what he's doing, and what the plan is.
[00:49:01.287 --> 00:49:03.388]  He is intending to take action.
[00:49:03.388 --> 00:49:16.837]  He just wants to hear from the troops about their ideas before he prepares to execute operations against the shield and the bullhorn of the globalists, the chi-coms, and that is big tech giants.
[00:49:16.837 --> 00:49:23.222]  Google, Facebook, Twitter, and of course the kingpins of evil, the folks at Apple.
[00:49:24.156 --> 00:49:27.398]  So that is all coming up in the third hour.
[00:49:27.398 --> 00:49:28.559]  Believe me, you don't want to miss that.
[00:49:28.559 --> 00:49:37.464]  Now, I mean, just look at all these articles.
[00:49:37.464 --> 00:49:41.686]  I just mentioned a bunch of stuff that I have here.
[00:49:41.686 --> 00:49:52.453]  Stack after stack after stack after stack after stack after stack of the most obscene globalist garbage
[00:49:53.570 --> 00:49:55.671]  And this is just what they admit.
[00:49:55.671 --> 00:50:05.034]  Going to islands where kidnapped 12-year-old girls were taken for Bill Clinton and others to have sex with them.
[00:50:05.034 --> 00:50:09.376]  And that's what they're admitting.
[00:50:09.376 --> 00:50:12.317]  Tied into the NXIVM sex cult.
[00:50:12.317 --> 00:50:14.458]  Snuff films.
[00:50:14.458 --> 00:50:14.738]  All of it.
[00:50:16.206 --> 00:50:17.167]  People are so naive.
[00:50:17.167 --> 00:50:24.333]  I remember 20 years ago being on air and I'd be reading some law enforcement report where they had convictions for the people trafficking in it to L.A.
[00:50:24.333 --> 00:50:24.953]  in the V.H.S.
[00:50:24.953 --> 00:50:29.837]  tapes and confirmed little kids being tortured and killed.
[00:50:29.837 --> 00:50:38.484]  And people would call into the show, because it wasn't TV then, and they'd say, there's no way that's true.
[00:50:38.484 --> 00:50:43.048]  There's no way our national parks have been signed over to the U.N.
[00:50:43.048 --> 00:50:44.910]  There's no way they're keeping babies alive.
[00:50:46.169 --> 00:50:50.550]  There's no way they take blood at birth from your baby and send it for a blood test, but it's really sent to the UN.
[00:50:50.550 --> 00:50:51.931]  All of that is known now.
[00:50:51.931 --> 00:50:54.872]  All of that is confirmed.
[00:50:54.872 --> 00:50:58.533]  Just like everything else we talk about.
[00:50:58.533 --> 00:51:05.875]  And we've made real sacrifices to be here on air.
[00:51:05.875 --> 00:51:07.995]  And we fought hard, and thanks to you, we are here.
[00:51:07.995 --> 00:51:09.956]  So I want every listener to understand something.
[00:51:09.956 --> 00:51:12.957]  I am honored to be in this position.
[00:51:14.858 --> 00:51:25.781]  I am thankful, no matter how bad the persecution is, because somebody's got to stand up for the unborn, and for the already born being killed, and for all these little children.
[00:51:25.781 --> 00:51:34.564]  And we go out to these Democrat events, we're not cherry-picking, and these women walk over, and we've got an M4's mic flag, or when we don't use M4's mic flags, we can really hear what they think.
[00:51:34.564 --> 00:51:40.105]  And they'll go, I'm so sick of these little kids, I say kill them up to age three.
[00:51:40.105 --> 00:51:42.586]  So annoying to hear their little mouths running.
[00:51:43.766 --> 00:51:45.486]  That was just a few weeks ago we got that on tape.
[00:51:45.486 --> 00:52:02.231]  And we've got dozens of these in just the last month, you've seen me play them, where the operating system of these demon-possessed people is just they walk over, women always walk real crazy, kind of the billionaire strut, and they just go, I'd like to kill some kids!
[00:52:02.231 --> 00:52:06.492]  Children must be gotten rid of, little bastards, little voices make me sick.
[00:52:06.492 --> 00:52:09.633]  I mean, what frickin' space alien is this, man?
[00:52:09.633 --> 00:52:11.854]  Because it's not women.
[00:52:12.867 --> 00:52:16.548]  And after you've been to enough of these rallies, seen enough video, it's like the same creature.
[00:52:16.548 --> 00:52:18.489]  It talks the same, it acts the same.
[00:52:18.489 --> 00:52:22.050]  Just like something out of Hellraiser.
[00:52:22.050 --> 00:52:28.552]  Or something out of The Exorcist.
[00:52:28.552 --> 00:52:30.233]  But it's worse than The Exorcist.
[00:52:31.164 --> 00:52:35.085]  Linda Blair couldn't act as scary as the real deal.
[00:52:35.085 --> 00:52:36.586]  Go out and see them.
[00:52:36.586 --> 00:52:38.227]  Go out and look at them.
[00:52:38.227 --> 00:52:39.727]  They're everywhere now.
[00:52:39.727 --> 00:52:42.128]  Humans are losing their souls in mass.
[00:52:42.128 --> 00:52:55.293]  Just like the Bible says, in the end times, demons will run rampant, large portions of the population will be demon possessed, hell will be opened up.
[00:52:55.293 --> 00:53:00.435]  I remember sitting there in church hearing that, in real churches in Dallas, and thinking, man, that's crazy.
[00:53:02.227 --> 00:53:05.909]  And then you actually see it.
[00:53:05.909 --> 00:53:07.450]  I kill my children.
[00:53:07.450 --> 00:53:08.911]  I want to kill more.
[00:53:08.911 --> 00:53:10.291]  I've paid for 50 abortions.
[00:53:10.291 --> 00:53:11.752]  That's what they say.
[00:53:11.752 --> 00:53:15.074]  I love it!
[00:53:15.074 --> 00:53:17.915]  And then you see the undercover videos at their own antifa meetings.
[00:53:17.915 --> 00:53:19.336]  They'll be like laughing about it.
[00:53:19.336 --> 00:53:21.017]  Yeah, we like to have sex with kids.
[00:53:21.017 --> 00:53:27.961]  Yeah, it kills little bastards and it's all... And they all look ugly and soul-sucked and shriveled.
[00:53:27.961 --> 00:53:29.902]  These are people that have succumbed
[00:53:31.271 --> 00:53:32.292]  They have succumbed.
[00:53:32.292 --> 00:53:37.075]  It's real.
[00:53:37.075 --> 00:53:39.116]  Darren, put that clip together about a week ago.
[00:53:39.116 --> 00:53:41.758]  It's got like 15 clips of, oh, those little kids.
[00:53:41.758 --> 00:53:42.319]  Screw them.
[00:53:42.319 --> 00:53:43.700]  Get in there and crush them.
[00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:44.160]  Murder them.
[00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:46.922]  Get rid of those little trashy bastards.
[00:53:46.922 --> 00:53:48.523]  So much fun to kill a baby.
[00:53:48.523 --> 00:53:50.344]  Watch them fight for their lives.
[00:53:50.344 --> 00:53:51.465]  When that scalpel comes from them.
[00:53:54.457 --> 00:53:59.163]  Again, I didn't know all this stuff 25 years ago when I would go protest at an abortion clinic.
[00:53:59.163 --> 00:54:04.669]  Because I felt guilty because I'd been involved in something when I was younger and didn't know.
[00:54:04.669 --> 00:54:07.813]  And man, people walk over and they also just go, I'm gonna get you!
[00:54:07.813 --> 00:54:09.435]  And you're like, whoa!
[00:54:11.254 --> 00:54:13.194]  Well, of course, they're in there killing babies all day.
[00:54:13.194 --> 00:54:14.835]  What type of person do you think?
[00:54:14.835 --> 00:54:25.056]  You do that, God removes protection from you, and whatever this space junk is, whatever these programs are, we all know how computers work and programs, we are electrochemical.
[00:54:25.056 --> 00:54:27.797]  And these viruses get into us and take us over.
[00:54:27.797 --> 00:54:30.297]  That's what this is, it's scientific.
[00:54:30.297 --> 00:54:31.318]  I don't know all the details.
[00:54:31.318 --> 00:54:34.738]  The Bible says once we'll find out, we won't believe it all, it'll be so incredible.
[00:54:34.738 --> 00:54:38.339]  Eye hasn't seen, ear hasn't heard, no one's imagined what this really is.
[00:54:38.339 --> 00:54:39.259]  But when we find out,
[00:54:41.144 --> 00:54:43.567]  Isn't it going to be interesting?
[00:54:43.567 --> 00:54:48.194]  And don't you just want to be with God forever instead of Satan?
[00:54:48.194 --> 00:54:53.401]  Alright, I'm going to come back with that abortion four minute video that McBrain put together.
[00:54:53.401 --> 00:54:56.585]  It's only a small sampling of the worship of killing babies and I've played a lot.
[00:54:56.585 --> 00:54:57.747]  I want you to see who these people are.
[00:54:57.747 --> 00:54:58.588]  This is out in the open.
[00:55:04.087 --> 00:55:05.528]  It's all sick.
[00:55:05.528 --> 00:55:06.469]  Oh, they're not a human.
[00:55:06.469 --> 00:55:07.370]  Oh, they don't have a life.
[00:55:07.370 --> 00:55:08.891]  Oh, we decided to kill them.
[00:55:08.891 --> 00:55:14.737]  But after we harvest them, we keep them comfortable though.
[00:55:14.737 --> 00:55:15.758]  We're going to go to break.
[00:55:15.758 --> 00:55:16.799]  I'll still show anymore.
[00:55:16.799 --> 00:55:17.499]  I can't look at it.
[00:55:17.499 --> 00:55:18.340]  Okay.
[00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:19.721]  Thanks.
[00:55:19.721 --> 00:55:22.404]  We're going to go to break.
[00:55:22.404 --> 00:55:22.704]  Haunting.
[00:55:24.121 --> 00:55:25.862]  And we're going to come back.
[00:55:25.862 --> 00:55:31.666]  I've got a bunch of big initiatives that are super exciting that are going on behind the scenes.
[00:55:31.666 --> 00:55:32.927]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:55:32.927 --> 00:55:35.509]  InfoWars is not all that we're doing.
[00:55:35.509 --> 00:55:38.471]  There's a lot of reasons they really want us dead, okay?
[00:55:38.471 --> 00:55:51.379]  But I've got some opportunities for some initiatives that I know in my gut, spiritually, but also just from my research at a business level, fighting the globalists as a business model.
[00:55:51.379 --> 00:55:52.140]  That's how we're successful.
[00:55:53.171 --> 00:55:57.393]  That will knock major holes in their guts.
[00:55:57.393 --> 00:55:59.574]  Knock holes in their heads politically.
[00:55:59.574 --> 00:56:01.475]  I want to sink globalist operations.
[00:56:01.475 --> 00:56:03.916]  I want to savage the living hell out of them.
[00:56:03.916 --> 00:56:09.978]  And I've got major plans that I know I can execute within just three months.
[00:56:09.978 --> 00:56:12.379]  And boy does the enemy, the enemy's obviously got all my phones tapped.
[00:56:12.379 --> 00:56:13.980]  They know all this stuff.
[00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:16.141]  They're just hoping, they're just hoping.
[00:56:16.141 --> 00:56:18.402]  So I was thinking this weekend, I said, why don't I just come tell everybody?
[00:56:19.383 --> 00:56:20.704]  Why do I need a bunch of money?
[00:56:20.704 --> 00:56:23.446]  It's not just to pay lawyers or fight fake lawsuits.
[00:56:23.446 --> 00:56:25.627]  None of that's going to matter two years from now.
[00:56:25.627 --> 00:56:29.090]  That's why the enemy doesn't care and lies about everything and it's so crazy now.
[00:56:29.090 --> 00:56:31.972]  What we do now is what matters and they know that.
[00:56:31.972 --> 00:56:39.337]  Infowars is winning and we've got all sorts of systems and we have got absolute directives from the President.
[00:56:40.578 --> 00:56:44.140]  Directives from the President to intensify operations.
[00:56:44.140 --> 00:56:47.262]  And he's surrounded by a bunch of cowards and bootlickers, but there's some good people in there.
[00:56:47.262 --> 00:56:50.024]  But the President is really starting to make some moves.
[00:56:50.024 --> 00:56:51.465]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:56:51.465 --> 00:56:54.467]  And I had some very interesting conversations last week.
[00:56:54.467 --> 00:56:56.208]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:56:56.208 --> 00:56:57.489]  Very interesting conversation yesterday.
[00:56:57.489 --> 00:56:58.650]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:56:58.650 --> 00:57:01.932]  But I need money.
[00:57:01.932 --> 00:57:02.932]  There's no sugar daddy.
[00:57:02.932 --> 00:57:03.793]  There's no globalists.
[00:57:03.793 --> 00:57:04.654]  There's none of that.
[00:57:04.654 --> 00:57:06.435]  The Koch brothers give money to Democrats.
[00:57:06.435 --> 00:57:07.315]  They were never Republicans.
[00:57:07.315 --> 00:57:08.276]  That's a cover story.
[00:57:08.276 --> 00:57:09.977]  They gave money to Republicans to take control of them.
[00:57:11.237 --> 00:57:13.458]  They're funding against me, by the way.
[00:57:13.458 --> 00:57:14.319]  Not just Soros.
[00:57:14.319 --> 00:57:14.899]  Not just Hillary.
[00:57:14.899 --> 00:57:18.121]  But, you know, I'm up against the big dogs, okay?
[00:57:18.121 --> 00:57:19.822]  It's okay.
[00:57:19.822 --> 00:57:21.062]  We are smart.
[00:57:21.062 --> 00:57:22.443]  You are smart.
[00:57:22.443 --> 00:57:23.584]  You need to go to InfoWarshaw.com.
[00:57:23.584 --> 00:57:26.926]  This is the last day because I got a new special starting tomorrow.
[00:57:27.995 --> 00:57:30.897]  We will always be the people who defeated a tyrant, crossed the cotton,
[00:57:56.036 --> 00:58:08.052]  Arnaud Science took to the skies and soared into the heavens because we will never forget that we are Americans and the future belongs to us.
[00:58:13.362 --> 00:58:18.366]  The future belongs to the brave, the strong, the proud, and the free.
[00:58:18.366 --> 00:58:25.631]  We are one people chasing one dream and one magnificent destiny.
[00:58:25.631 --> 00:58:31.015]  We all share the same heroes, the same home, the same heart.
[00:58:31.995 --> 00:58:37.042]  And we are all made by the same almighty God.
[00:58:37.042 --> 00:58:38.164]  Infowars.com.
[00:58:38.164 --> 00:58:39.306]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:58:39.306 --> 00:58:42.069]  Full power of the Republic in the name of Jesus Christ.
[00:58:42.069 --> 00:58:43.752]  Full power!
[00:58:43.752 --> 00:58:44.853]  Damn the torpedoes!
[00:58:44.853 --> 00:58:45.735]  Go straight at them!
[00:58:51.026 --> 00:58:55.187]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:58:55.187 --> 00:59:05.590]  So the InfoWars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another.
[00:59:05.590 --> 00:59:08.731]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale.
[00:59:08.911 --> 00:59:09.211]  Of course.
[00:59:25.043 --> 00:59:42.792]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[00:59:42.792 --> 00:59:49.495]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[00:59:53.266 --> 01:00:00.912]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:00.912 --> 01:00:05.756]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:00:05.756 --> 01:00:06.636]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:00:15.538 --> 01:00:29.132]  Well, the article's up on Infowars.com and Newswars.com, the exclusive big announcement with Tommy Robinson coming up in the next segment, but you'll want to go learn what he's calling for and what he said, why it's so important.
[01:00:29.132 --> 01:00:30.393]  It's bigger than Tommy Robinson.
[01:00:30.393 --> 01:00:31.374]  Wait till we break it down.
[01:00:31.374 --> 01:00:36.299]  Then I'm going to go over the details of the internal war inside the government.
[01:00:37.546 --> 01:00:43.510]  To bring down the deep state whose currency is the trafficking and organ harvesting and killing of children.
[01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:53.856]  There's hundreds of different ways they do it, but it's... At the end of the day, it's about degradating God's most precious creations and children made in the image of God that are the seed of the potential of the universe.
[01:00:53.856 --> 01:00:56.438]  And here's the enemy whose religion is attacking children.
[01:00:57.852 --> 01:01:01.273]  Our main story tonight concerns breast implants.
[01:01:01.273 --> 01:01:08.696]  Some are against them, others believe they're fine in rare cases, and many believe you should be able to get them whenever the f**k you want.
[01:01:08.696 --> 01:01:10.597]  Sorry, did I say breast implants?
[01:01:10.597 --> 01:01:12.038]  I meant abortions.
[01:01:12.038 --> 01:01:13.698]  Tonight's main topic concerns abortion.
[01:01:13.698 --> 01:01:23.502]  So tonight, in honor of America, I'd like to do a salute to abortion in the brand's 10th annual Salute to Abortion!
[01:01:26.038 --> 01:01:27.699]  Get out of my behind!
[01:01:27.699 --> 01:01:28.420]  Get out of my vagina!
[01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:30.082]  Get out!
[01:01:30.082 --> 01:01:34.085]  It's a woman's body and she should not be forced to carry anything inside of it.
[01:01:34.085 --> 01:01:36.347]  You wouldn't make her keep a tapeworm.
[01:01:36.347 --> 01:01:37.348]  Is that how the heart beats?
[01:01:37.348 --> 01:01:39.470]  So you're comparing a baby to a tapeworm?
[01:01:39.470 --> 01:01:41.612]  A fetus is a parasite, sweetie.
[01:01:41.612 --> 01:01:44.154]  That is not what a fetus looks like, okay?
[01:01:44.154 --> 01:01:45.775]  It's a group of cells at 12 weeks.
[01:01:45.775 --> 01:01:49.779]  You think that it is the white man's duty to fix everybody's problems, right?
[01:01:49.779 --> 01:01:50.639]  How many kids do you have?
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:52.981]  How many did I adopt?
[01:01:52.981 --> 01:01:53.842]  I kill my kids.
[01:01:53.842 --> 01:01:55.103]  Oh, that's what you do to babies, huh?
[01:01:55.103 --> 01:01:56.604]  Yeah, I love it.
[01:01:56.604 --> 01:01:57.124]  You love it, huh?
[01:01:57.124 --> 01:01:57.805]  Yeah, I do.
[01:01:57.805 --> 01:02:00.167]  Okay, I hope that you come to Christ, sir.
[01:02:00.167 --> 01:02:01.708]  Oh, I never go to Christ.
[01:02:01.708 --> 01:02:02.809]  I hope that you come to Christ, sir.
[01:02:02.809 --> 01:02:03.869]  No, I don't go to Christ.
[01:02:03.869 --> 01:02:05.671]  A fertilized egg is a human being!
[01:02:05.671 --> 01:02:07.973]  A fertilized egg is a human being!
[01:02:07.973 --> 01:02:08.553]  You're a pig.
[01:02:08.553 --> 01:02:11.095]  Because I don't want to kill babies.
[01:02:11.095 --> 01:02:12.196]  Oh, you kill them.
[01:02:12.196 --> 01:02:15.338]  You let them live so they can starve to death.
[01:02:15.338 --> 01:02:16.199]  Why'd you spit at us?
[01:02:17.197 --> 01:02:19.079]  I, uh, don't agree with you.
[01:02:19.079 --> 01:02:21.941]  No uterus, no right to talk about it.
[01:02:21.941 --> 01:02:23.303]  Understand me, motherfucker?
[01:02:23.303 --> 01:02:33.091]  In the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother, just prior to the birth of the baby.
[01:02:33.091 --> 01:02:39.797]  Now, you can say that that's okay, and Hillary can say that that's okay, but it's not okay with me.
[01:02:40.017 --> 01:02:47.503]  Well, that is not what happens in these cases and using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate.
[01:02:47.503 --> 01:02:55.789]  New York Governor Andrew Cuomo lit up the One World Trade Center's spire in pink to celebrate his radical expansion of abortion in New York.
[01:02:55.789 --> 01:03:03.976]  State lawmakers approved a law permitting abortion in the state for any reason until the 24th week of pregnancy and then up until birth.
[01:03:04.216 --> 01:03:07.877]  If a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen.
[01:03:07.877 --> 01:03:09.937]  The infant would be delivered.
[01:03:09.937 --> 01:03:12.357]  The infant would be kept comfortable.
[01:03:12.357 --> 01:03:17.458]  The infant would be resuscitated, if that's what the mother and the family desired.
[01:03:17.458 --> 01:03:21.319]  And then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.
[01:03:21.319 --> 01:03:23.559]  There was a question over here.
[01:03:23.559 --> 01:03:23.800]  Yes.
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:26.840]  Are you for third trimester abortions?
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:30.341]  My answer to you is that that should be a decision that the woman makes.
[01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:38.274]  There's scientific consensus that the lives of children are going to be very difficult.
[01:03:38.274 --> 01:03:40.075]  Is it okay to still have children?
[01:03:40.075 --> 01:03:47.521]  How do you justify the decision to allow Planned Parenthood to rent in this city for free?
[01:03:47.521 --> 01:03:48.041]  That's your time.
[01:03:48.041 --> 01:03:48.641]  Next speaker.
[01:03:48.641 --> 01:03:56.127]  There's a new video out on InfoWars.com of two partial birth abortion, eight and a half month old babies.
[01:03:57.694 --> 01:04:00.775]  And it makes you want to kill people.
[01:04:00.775 --> 01:04:03.315]  I'll just be honest with you right now.
[01:04:03.315 --> 01:04:10.257]  My guts, my spirit sees a baby who got killed and its brain sucked out by some asshole.
[01:04:10.257 --> 01:04:11.757]  And then they make a joke out of it.
[01:04:11.757 --> 01:04:17.658]  These are abortion doctors with third trimester babies that were about to be born.
[01:04:17.658 --> 01:04:21.059]  Defiling them, making jokes about them that they're having a fight.
[01:04:21.059 --> 01:04:24.000]  They're playing with dead babies in a little
[01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:28.022]  God bless abortions and God bless America!
[01:04:28.022 --> 01:04:29.724]  Don't knock it till you try it.
[01:04:29.724 --> 01:04:31.345]  And when you do try it, really knock it.
[01:04:31.345 --> 01:04:33.267]  You know, you gotta get that baby out of there.
[01:04:58.929 --> 01:05:03.715]  Serving with Info Wars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee.
[01:05:05.086 --> 01:05:14.494]  And luckily, our break room at the InfoWars headquarters is stocked full of high-quality InfoWars store Patriot Blend coffee.
[01:05:14.494 --> 01:05:26.143]  Grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico, the Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic, non-GMO coffee at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[01:05:26.143 --> 01:05:30.347]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[01:05:31.247 --> 01:05:35.289]  There has never been a more important time to support InfoWars.
[01:05:35.289 --> 01:05:42.191]  So if you love coffee, and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.
[01:05:42.191 --> 01:05:45.092]  Order now at the InfoWars store.
[01:05:45.092 --> 01:05:54.796]  Sign up for auto-ship and get your own high-quality supply of Patriot Blend coffee delivered right to your door at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:06:05.694 --> 01:06:11.920]  For humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:16.344]  You better believe you got one!
[01:06:16.344 --> 01:06:21.449]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:38.641 --> 01:06:41.242]  There is a war on journalists across the world.
[01:06:41.242 --> 01:06:44.583]  We know that's happening in China where they jail and even kill them.
[01:06:44.583 --> 01:06:55.008]  We give political asylum all the time to Cuban journalists because they face prison for reporting on what the state has been doing.
[01:06:55.008 --> 01:06:57.769]  Here's an example right here.
[01:06:57.769 --> 01:07:07.933]  Cuban journalist Saffron Moran granted asylum in the United States because he was being persecuted because he wasn't being allowed to do his reporting and faced jail.
[01:07:10.151 --> 01:07:12.713]  Well, look at the UK.
[01:07:12.713 --> 01:07:19.458]  Look at areas of the EU where they arrest people that report on Islamic child kidnapping rings.
[01:07:19.458 --> 01:07:22.700]  Well, who first exposed that 12 years ago?
[01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:23.740]  Tommy Robinson.
[01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:26.242]  He saw them with little girls as young as 10.
[01:07:26.242 --> 01:07:31.126]  Some of them ended up dead, cut up and put into kebab machines, sold as meat on the street.
[01:07:31.126 --> 01:07:31.826]  That's mainstream news.
[01:07:31.826 --> 01:07:35.709]  It was Tommy Robinson exposed this.
[01:07:35.709 --> 01:07:38.431]  Girls trafficked in some towns by the thousands.
[01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:43.161]  Just in towns.
[01:07:43.161 --> 01:07:48.683]  The trafficking of women is part of the Islamic system in many nations of the world.
[01:07:48.683 --> 01:07:51.424]  Not just places like Somalia, but Pakistan.
[01:07:51.424 --> 01:07:53.264]  The list goes on and on.
[01:07:53.264 --> 01:07:56.785]  And Tommy Robinson is a political prisoner.
[01:07:56.785 --> 01:07:58.646]  He spent over a year in prison.
[01:07:58.646 --> 01:08:01.727]  They acid attacked him.
[01:08:01.727 --> 01:08:05.368]  He was thrown in for three months in solitary confinement, lost almost 40 pounds this year.
[01:08:05.368 --> 01:08:08.009]  Give him a big news story.
[01:08:08.009 --> 01:08:08.949]  Tucker Carlson had him on.
[01:08:10.558 --> 01:08:14.520]  He's been out on appeal for the crime of committing journalism.
[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:16.261]  That's what it is.
[01:08:16.261 --> 01:08:19.663]  And now they found him in three counts of contempt.
[01:08:19.663 --> 01:08:24.185]  He could serve years in solitary confinement, which is a death sentence.
[01:08:24.185 --> 01:08:26.507]  But because it's the UK, we go, oh, well, that's all right.
[01:08:26.507 --> 01:08:28.288]  You know, they just got rid of free speech over there.
[01:08:28.288 --> 01:08:30.389]  But it's not like Cuba when they do it.
[01:08:31.991 --> 01:08:35.356]  So Tommy Robinson is going to have the floor for the rest of this hour.
[01:08:35.356 --> 01:08:36.277]  I'll intro and outro.
[01:08:36.277 --> 01:08:37.860]  We're going to break in seven minutes.
[01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:40.864]  He sent us a special report video he just compiled.
[01:08:40.864 --> 01:08:43.348]  He's about to premiere here.
[01:08:43.348 --> 01:08:47.294]  And this is going to be his request to the president.
[01:08:48.715 --> 01:08:52.098]  Well, I'll just let him say it himself.
[01:08:52.098 --> 01:08:58.382]  Tommy, you're a hero to so many and absolutely don't want to see you disappear as they're planning.
[01:08:58.382 --> 01:09:00.584]  I know you first just want to give the basic facts.
[01:09:00.584 --> 01:09:03.486]  The President will probably have five minutes to just watch this.
[01:09:03.486 --> 01:09:04.347]  I know we can get it to him.
[01:09:04.727 --> 01:09:16.196]  And then obviously you're going to give a report to his staff who can look into the case and see that it's just as bad as stuff that happens in Cuba or other authoritarian states and that you and your family absolutely need political emergency asylum.
[01:09:16.196 --> 01:09:16.816]  I have the U.S.
[01:09:16.816 --> 01:09:17.797]  Code right here.
[01:09:17.797 --> 01:09:20.959]  We'll go over towards the end of the hour, but you have the floor, my friend.
[01:09:20.959 --> 01:09:23.401]  And so thank you for joining us.
[01:09:23.401 --> 01:09:24.061]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:09:24.061 --> 01:09:28.505]  I've got a lot of information I want to get across so people can understand exactly what's happening in the UK.
[01:09:30.034 --> 01:09:34.039]  This week I was found guilty on three counts of contempt of court by two judges.
[01:09:34.039 --> 01:09:36.202]  There was no jury to find me guilty.
[01:09:36.202 --> 01:09:38.424]  Two appointed judges.
[01:09:38.424 --> 01:09:41.007]  As I sat in court I couldn't believe what I was hearing.
[01:09:41.007 --> 01:09:47.175]  Both judges found me guilty because they believed I breached the reporting restriction on a Muslim child gang rape trial.
[01:09:47.867 --> 01:10:04.360]  They also came to the conclusion that me photographing Muslim child rapists while asking them simple questions before they entered court for their verdicts created anxiety for the poor Muslim paedophiles that I'm now to be punished with the full might of the British judicial system.
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:06.982]  My name is Tommy Robinson.
[01:10:06.982 --> 01:10:17.070]  Today I'm calling on the help of Donald Trump, his administration and the Republican Party to grant me and my family political asylum in the United States of America.
[01:10:17.873 --> 01:10:22.056]  I'm sat here today before you to make my case of political persecution.
[01:10:22.056 --> 01:10:27.599]  I have been found guilty of what is the equivalent of exercising First Amendment rights.
[01:10:27.599 --> 01:10:30.801]  Benjamin Franklin had the foresight to know this.
[01:10:30.801 --> 01:10:35.985]  Whoever would overthrow the liberty of a nation must begin by subduing the freeness of speech.
[01:10:36.894 --> 01:10:50.977]  For more than 10 years I've been proactive voice, highlighting the industrialised grooming, the pimping, the beating and the raping of young vulnerable British girls up and down the length and breadth of my once great country.
[01:10:50.977 --> 01:10:55.638]  Subsessive British governments have sought to silence me, to persecute me.
[01:10:55.638 --> 01:10:56.938]  And for what?
[01:10:56.938 --> 01:11:05.980]  Trying to stop vulnerable young girls from being sex slaves to gangs of predominantly predatory Muslim men who drug them, rape them and beat them for years.
[01:11:06.810 --> 01:11:15.612]  I have tried and I'll continue to try to get the British Government to take action and stop the systematic child abuse that's still going on right now as we sit on screen.
[01:11:15.612 --> 01:11:19.414]  These young victims of Muslim rape gangs have been let down so badly.
[01:11:19.414 --> 01:11:24.935]  It started at the very top of the Labour-controlled government under Gordon Brown as Prime Minister.
[01:11:24.935 --> 01:11:28.716]  Their stories are harrowing, disturbing, upsetting.
[01:11:28.716 --> 01:11:31.157]  Believe me, I've sat down and I've cried my eyes out.
[01:11:31.157 --> 01:11:35.278]  I've sat and heard the stories from victim after victim and family after family.
[01:11:36.101 --> 01:11:41.285]  Let me outline to you what has happened in the second trial from contempt of court.
[01:11:41.285 --> 01:11:47.049]  The original verdict was appealed due to unfairness and no due process.
[01:11:47.049 --> 01:11:54.615]  There were no charges of prejudice in the case or potentially collapse in the trial as the media continued to push out.
[01:11:54.615 --> 01:12:03.882]  They originally tried to bring those charges last year but had to remove them as it's been proved in court twice that nothing I said in my live stream could have prejudiced the jury.
[01:12:05.004 --> 01:12:07.745]  One charge was for breaching a reporting restriction.
[01:12:07.745 --> 01:12:15.849]  The other two charges were for photographing the defendants whilst entering court and, according to the judge, aggressively questioning them.
[01:12:15.849 --> 01:12:27.213]  Both of these acts the Attorney General and the Government have claimed could have made these poor Muslim child rapists feel anxious and therefore not able to participate in their trial.
[01:12:27.213 --> 01:12:30.054]  This is despite the fact the trial had already finished.
[01:12:30.054 --> 01:12:31.475]  They had nothing to participate in.
[01:12:32.153 --> 01:12:38.502]  The trial had finished, the jury had retired to decide their verdict, which all came back as guilty.
[01:12:38.502 --> 01:12:42.427]  I just want to show you now so your American audience understand.
[01:12:42.427 --> 01:12:45.231]  Let's look at the anxiety charges first.
[01:12:45.231 --> 01:12:48.736]  Let me show you what I actually said outside Leeds Crown Court.
[01:12:51.151 --> 01:12:55.573]  I'm at Lee's Crown Court, where these men here, where these men here, let me see.
[01:12:55.573 --> 01:12:57.133]  Alright lads, how you feeling?
[01:12:57.133 --> 01:12:58.274]  How you feeling about your verdict?
[01:12:58.274 --> 01:13:01.775]  How you feeling about your verdict?
[01:13:01.775 --> 01:13:02.876]  How you feeling about your verdict?
[01:13:02.876 --> 01:13:03.276]  What verdict?
[01:13:03.276 --> 01:13:04.296]  How you feeling about the verdict?
[01:13:04.296 --> 01:13:06.137]  You got your prison bag with you?
[01:13:06.137 --> 01:13:06.937]  Yeah, look at you.
[01:13:06.937 --> 01:13:07.838]  You got your bags with you?
[01:13:07.838 --> 01:13:08.838]  You got your bags with you?
[01:13:08.838 --> 01:13:08.978]  Yeah.
[01:13:08.978 --> 01:13:10.819]  How you feeling about the verdict?
[01:13:10.819 --> 01:13:12.920]  I'll suck your mum's fanny!
[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:13.680]  You've got no guilt!
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:14.420]  Is there any guilt?
[01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:15.301]  Is there any guilt, mate?
[01:13:15.301 --> 01:13:16.021]  Is there any guilt?
[01:13:16.021 --> 01:13:16.921]  You're fucking dumb!
[01:13:16.921 --> 01:13:17.762]  You son of a bitch!
[01:13:20.083 --> 01:13:20.684]  I don't know.
[01:13:20.684 --> 01:13:21.784]  Your wife's a prostitute?
[01:13:21.784 --> 01:13:23.666]  My wife's a prostitute?
[01:13:23.666 --> 01:13:25.428]  My wife's a prostitute?
[01:13:25.428 --> 01:13:27.890]  Hey there, mate.
[01:13:27.890 --> 01:13:29.411]  What you in court for today, if that's what I'm asking?
[01:13:29.411 --> 01:13:31.152]  I've been seeing your mum.
[01:13:31.152 --> 01:13:32.454]  You've been seeing my mum?
[01:13:32.454 --> 01:13:34.255]  Another comment about a woman.
[01:13:34.255 --> 01:13:35.756]  What you in court for, mate?
[01:13:35.756 --> 01:13:38.719]  How's the trial gone?
[01:13:38.719 --> 01:13:39.399]  How's the trial gone?
[01:13:39.399 --> 01:13:42.402]  Yeah, how's the trial gone?
[01:13:42.402 --> 01:13:43.363]  How's the trial gone, bro?
[01:13:44.918 --> 01:13:46.058]  I'm the one in court.
[01:13:46.058 --> 01:13:47.599]  You're the one in court, yeah?
[01:13:47.599 --> 01:13:51.060]  Why's he carrying your bag then?
[01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:56.782]  Anyway... Another comment about your mum.
[01:13:56.782 --> 01:14:01.304]  That's every single alleged person who's walked into... Cheers mate, thanks.
[01:14:01.304 --> 01:14:05.906]  Every single alleged person who's walked into court today has made sexual references about women.
[01:14:09.127 --> 01:14:10.688]  What was it?
[01:14:10.688 --> 01:14:11.549]  Which one?
[01:14:11.549 --> 01:14:16.913]  Mate, what are you in court for?
[01:14:16.913 --> 01:14:18.335]  This is the verdict.
[01:14:18.335 --> 01:14:25.560]  So the trial's ended, the jury are making their mind up and this is the verdict.
[01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:27.142]  This is the verdict tonight.
[01:14:27.142 --> 01:14:31.866]  Are you going to arrest me?
[01:14:31.866 --> 01:14:35.308]  My colleague's going to explain what's going to happen next, right?
[01:14:35.308 --> 01:14:35.789]  Am I being arrested?
[01:14:37.675 --> 01:14:38.475]  I am being arrested.
[01:14:38.475 --> 01:14:41.138]  I've caused a breach of peace.
[01:14:41.138 --> 01:14:42.319]  I've caused a breach of peace.
[01:14:42.319 --> 01:14:43.400]  I'm being arrested.
[01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:48.704]  The content of what you're streaming... The content of what I'm streaming, I'm being arrested for breach of peace.
[01:14:48.704 --> 01:14:50.325]  I'm being arrested for breach of peace.
[01:14:50.325 --> 01:14:51.186]  You've all watched this.
[01:14:51.186 --> 01:14:52.407]  You've all watched this.
[01:14:52.407 --> 01:14:53.568]  You've all watched this.
[01:14:53.568 --> 01:14:54.349]  You've all watched this.
[01:14:54.349 --> 01:14:55.650]  Can you get me a slicer?
[01:14:55.650 --> 01:14:56.430]  Can you get me a slicer?
[01:14:56.430 --> 01:14:57.331]  Can you get me a slicer?
[01:14:57.331 --> 01:14:57.491]  Yeah?
[01:15:01.115 --> 01:15:03.238]  Do you understand what I just said?
[01:15:03.238 --> 01:15:05.140]  Can you explain it again?
[01:15:05.140 --> 01:15:05.741]  What does that mean?
[01:15:05.741 --> 01:15:06.342]  What does that mean?
[01:15:16.835 --> 01:15:19.157]  Now, former political prisoner Tommy Robinson is with us.
[01:15:19.157 --> 01:15:19.958]  We're about to go break.
[01:15:19.958 --> 01:15:21.920]  He'll come back and be able to respond to this.
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:25.824]  He's got more exhibits, but this is one of the reasons he's going to prison.
[01:15:25.824 --> 01:15:28.506]  He's standing out front when he's the guy that first exposed all this.
[01:15:28.506 --> 01:15:35.874]  They've been convicted, just like any other media would do, just like England did before, saying, hey, how do you feel about being convicted?
[01:15:36.806 --> 01:15:39.148]  They say you were born out your mother's rear end.
[01:15:39.148 --> 01:15:43.992]  It's a religion under these guys of degradating women.
[01:15:43.992 --> 01:15:46.995]  And don't worry, these guys degradate your daughters real good.
[01:15:46.995 --> 01:15:48.216]  Them little age eight year olds.
[01:15:48.216 --> 01:15:53.540]  And if they run their mouths too much, some of these guys cut them up and feed them to people at kebab shops.
[01:15:53.540 --> 01:15:56.663]  That's a bigger Muslim joke, you see, to feed you your dead daughters.
[01:15:57.970 --> 01:16:09.015]  When you have a pain in the neck, a real pain in the neck, back, shoulder, or legs, you now have two convenient choices to get fast relief without taking another pill.

[01:17:53.617 --> 01:17:56.140]  Not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:06.466]  As we gather this evening in the joy of freedom, we remember that all share a truly extraordinary heritage.
[01:18:06.466 --> 01:18:12.690]  Together, we are part of one of the greatest stories ever told, the story of America.
[01:18:12.690 --> 01:18:21.315]  It is the epic tale of a great nation whose people have risked everything for what they know is right and what they know is true.

[01:20:01.287 --> 01:20:04.089]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:04.089 --> 01:20:20.080]  Journalism is under massive attack across the western world.
[01:20:21.263 --> 01:20:25.565]  President Trump has taken action when Sheriff Arpaio was being wrongfully imprisoned.
[01:20:25.565 --> 01:20:26.845]  Gave him a pardon.
[01:20:26.845 --> 01:20:32.227]  The submariner from 20 years ago who'd taken a photo of his workstation that wasn't even secret.
[01:20:32.227 --> 01:20:33.988]  He was sent to prison.
[01:20:33.988 --> 01:20:35.268]  Trump gave him a pardon.
[01:20:35.268 --> 01:20:40.030]  Well, Tommy Robinson is a hero across the UK and Europe and here.
[01:20:40.030 --> 01:20:42.271]  He's just a mainline guy that exposed.
[01:20:42.271 --> 01:20:48.393]  He owned a business, a tanning salon, and right next to it there were Muslim grooming gangs with little girls.
[01:20:49.363 --> 01:20:51.705]  He's like, hey mate, what are you doing putting little girls in guys' cars?
[01:20:51.705 --> 01:20:52.706]  You're obviously pimping them.
[01:20:52.706 --> 01:20:53.607]  Who's your daddy?
[01:20:53.607 --> 01:20:55.708]  They started threatening Tommy.
[01:20:55.708 --> 01:20:57.110]  Tommy stood up to him, reported him.
[01:20:57.110 --> 01:20:59.772]  Got put in prison for fighting back.
[01:20:59.772 --> 01:21:00.532]  He fights back.
[01:21:00.532 --> 01:21:01.833]  He's been attacked by Antifa.
[01:21:01.833 --> 01:21:04.476]  You've seen all the videos of them attacking him in public.
[01:21:04.476 --> 01:21:06.037]  He fights back.
[01:21:06.037 --> 01:21:07.999]  Antifa, the Islamists, all of it.
[01:21:07.999 --> 01:21:09.160]  This is only an eight-minute segment.
[01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:10.080]  Longer segment coming up.
[01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:15.545]  Tommy, you just showed the first exhibit of why they're sitting in a prison, daring to talk to guys who you were polite to.
[01:21:15.545 --> 01:21:16.446]  They insulted your family.
[01:21:18.541 --> 01:21:25.624]  Just greasy thugs who were convicted of grooming children for sex traffic.
[01:21:25.624 --> 01:21:28.165]  And of course, they gave him light sentences.
[01:21:28.165 --> 01:21:29.466]  You've talked about it all.
[01:21:29.466 --> 01:21:31.167]  This is another reason you need Trump.
[01:21:31.167 --> 01:21:32.167]  You're asking for Trump.
[01:21:32.167 --> 01:21:32.828]  We'll get to this.
[01:21:32.828 --> 01:21:34.649]  We'll get to the U.S.
[01:21:34.649 --> 01:21:34.909]  Code.
[01:21:34.909 --> 01:21:35.429]  22 U.S.
[01:21:35.429 --> 01:21:36.329]  Code 6401.
[01:21:36.329 --> 01:21:44.934]  Findings and policy that you are a prime candidate as a journalist to get political emergency asylum, but you're being sent to prison Thursday.
[01:21:44.934 --> 01:21:45.454]  Please continue.
[01:21:47.068 --> 01:21:50.089]  I've had a few people message me saying that I seem tense.
[01:21:50.089 --> 01:21:51.450]  It's because I am tense.
[01:21:51.450 --> 01:21:57.472]  I feel like I'm two days away from being sentenced to death in the UK for journalism.
[01:21:57.472 --> 01:22:03.675]  Let's be clear, the video you just watched, the questions I asked, I asked them as follows.
[01:22:03.675 --> 01:22:06.316]  Alright lads, how are you feeling?
[01:22:06.316 --> 01:22:08.517]  How are you feeling about your verdict?
[01:22:08.517 --> 01:22:09.897]  Alright mate, how are you doing?
[01:22:09.897 --> 01:22:11.358]  Are you alright?
[01:22:11.358 --> 01:22:14.499]  Hello mate, what are you in court for today, if you don't mind me asking?
[01:22:15.313 --> 01:22:18.796]  How's the trial gone, bro?
[01:22:18.796 --> 01:22:25.061]  As you can see, I was actually very polite despite some of the disgusting abuse that was thrown my way.
[01:22:25.061 --> 01:22:28.504]  By claiming that these questions were in any way aggressive.
[01:22:28.504 --> 01:22:34.428]  Not claiming, he said that, he skipped this in his summing up, the judge has said my aggressive question.
[01:22:34.428 --> 01:22:43.796]  The judge has had to say that and the prosecution have simply lied in court, in open court, in order to back up their ridiculous charge of causing the defendant's anxiety.
[01:22:44.761 --> 01:22:51.003]  Now these monsters have been previously kidnapping and raping young children in gangs for years.
[01:22:51.003 --> 01:22:55.865]  In full view of everyone, including the social services, the police forces, everyone knows it's happening.
[01:22:55.865 --> 01:22:58.986]  They don't sound like the anxious type to me.
[01:22:58.986 --> 01:23:00.067]  If these men were anxious,
[01:23:00.876 --> 01:23:05.638]  It's because they were facing a court case, they're all now subsequently doing 15 years in prison.
[01:23:05.638 --> 01:23:10.181]  They were facing a court case, they knew they were guilty, they'd raped dozens of young children.
[01:23:10.181 --> 01:23:16.404]  Yet somehow me asking them a simple question as a journalist, I'm now being convicted for causing them anxiety.
[01:23:16.404 --> 01:23:19.445]  One of them pushed me in the chest, told me to go fuck myself.
[01:23:19.445 --> 01:23:22.627]  I simply said, alright mate, what are you in court for?
[01:23:23.348 --> 01:23:31.971]  The other three child rapist monsters coincidentally all made disgusting and vulgar sexual references about female members of my family.
[01:23:31.971 --> 01:23:36.653]  One thing's for sure, none of them looked remotely anxious.
[01:23:36.653 --> 01:23:40.435]  According to the Attorney General and the Judge, I was aggressive.
[01:23:40.435 --> 01:23:45.016]  And in the words of the prosecution, I molested them as they entered court.
[01:23:45.016 --> 01:23:47.737]  No joke, this is what they said in court.
[01:23:47.737 --> 01:23:49.238]  Molested them.
[01:23:49.238 --> 01:23:51.899]  These are the guys that have molested and raped children for a decade.
[01:23:52.594 --> 01:24:00.395]  The Attorney General, and actually in their prosecution, said that these men must be free to go and come from court without fear of molestation.
[01:24:00.395 --> 01:24:07.377]  The reality is, with 16 child statements, witness statements, they shouldn't have been free to come and go from court at all.
[01:24:07.377 --> 01:24:09.977]  They should have been on remand.
[01:24:09.977 --> 01:24:11.137]  Let's have a look at me now.
[01:24:11.137 --> 01:24:13.698]  You've seen that footage that I have just been convicted of.
[01:24:13.698 --> 01:24:15.178]  You've seen the footage.
[01:24:15.178 --> 01:24:19.379]  Let's have a look at the footage of me entering the Old Bailey for this trial.
[01:24:19.379 --> 01:24:20.519]  Let me show you this now.
[01:24:21.926 --> 01:24:24.949]  So are you going to face justice for potentially collapsing this trial?
[01:24:24.949 --> 01:24:26.671]  I didn't potentially collapse any trial.
[01:24:26.671 --> 01:24:28.072]  I'm actually not in charge.
[01:24:28.072 --> 01:24:30.675]  I'm not on trial for potentially collapsing the trial.
[01:24:30.675 --> 01:24:35.760]  My charge is causing anxiety to the men walking into court by putting cameras and asking them questions.
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:39.104]  Exactly what you've just done to me is what I face contempt of court for.
[01:24:39.104 --> 01:24:39.805]  Exactly this.
[01:24:39.805 --> 01:24:41.666]  You think this is causing my anxiety?
[01:24:41.666 --> 01:24:41.807]  Look.
[01:24:42.367 --> 01:24:43.547]  Look at your actions.
[01:24:43.547 --> 01:24:45.468]  That's what I'm facing trial for.
[01:24:45.468 --> 01:24:50.050]  I didn't act this way.
[01:24:50.050 --> 01:24:50.970]  This is a facade.
[01:24:50.970 --> 01:24:51.831]  The whole public know that.
[01:24:51.831 --> 01:24:53.631]  That's why the public are here to support me.
[01:24:53.631 --> 01:24:54.892]  You nearly collapsed.
[01:24:54.892 --> 01:24:55.852]  No, I didn't nearly collapse.
[01:24:55.852 --> 01:24:56.332]  That's a lie.
[01:24:56.332 --> 01:24:56.912]  You're lying.
[01:24:56.912 --> 01:24:57.753]  You're lying.
[01:24:57.753 --> 01:24:58.493]  I didn't nearly collapse.
[01:24:58.493 --> 01:25:02.475]  The judge's words in that case, nothing I said because I've got a prejudice to draw in.
[01:25:02.475 --> 01:25:03.155]  Nothing.
[01:25:03.155 --> 01:25:04.495]  That's the judge's words.
[01:25:04.495 --> 01:25:05.876]  That's the judge's words.
[01:25:05.876 --> 01:25:06.976]  Read the transcript.
[01:25:06.976 --> 01:25:09.137]  Do your job as a journalist.
[01:25:09.137 --> 01:25:11.018]  Were you in contempt of court?
[01:25:11.018 --> 01:25:11.518]  No, I wasn't.
[01:25:11.818 --> 01:25:13.500]  That's why I was released from prison.
[01:25:13.500 --> 01:25:14.981]  The whole case was unlawful.
[01:25:14.981 --> 01:25:20.105]  This is politically motivated persecution by a government who want the silence.
[01:25:20.105 --> 01:25:21.206]  That's what this is.
[01:25:21.206 --> 01:25:24.469]  What do you think about the fact that all this trash is back?
[01:25:24.469 --> 01:25:26.411]  I think it tells everyone the facts.
[01:25:26.411 --> 01:25:27.432]  Look at what's happening here.
[01:25:27.432 --> 01:25:28.233]  Can you see this?
[01:25:28.233 --> 01:25:30.675]  Look, I'm in court for causing them anxiety.
[01:25:30.675 --> 01:25:31.536]  Look at all these cameras.
[01:25:31.536 --> 01:25:32.556]  Look at all these journalists.
[01:25:33.641 --> 01:25:34.602]  Stunning footage.
[01:25:34.602 --> 01:25:37.424]  Tommy Robinson is hosting the show.
[01:25:37.424 --> 01:25:39.165]  He's about to take back over again.
[01:25:39.165 --> 01:25:40.606]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:25:40.606 --> 01:25:46.550]  He's doing a direct appeal to President Trump for a journalistic asylum because the UK is now a police state.
[01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:59.720]  If you're a radio listener, these are dozens of cameras and people pressed around him, pressing in on him, saying he's a bad person as he goes in for the kangaroo court to be convicted of talking to people that were convicted in the street.
[01:26:00.874 --> 01:26:08.901]  And he says, I've been convicted for what you're doing right now, and they just look at him with hate because these aren't media, these are authoritarian lapdogs.
[01:26:08.901 --> 01:26:10.722]  This is how far the UK's fallen.
[01:26:10.722 --> 01:26:14.686]  Back to your statement, my friend.
[01:26:14.686 --> 01:26:20.390]  As you can see, that was me on my way into court, just like the Muslim child rapists on their way into court.
[01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:23.333]  Lucy Manning, leading BBC political broadcaster.
[01:26:23.333 --> 01:26:27.036]  She blocked my path, along with multiple other journalists and media cameramen.
[01:26:27.742 --> 01:26:30.385]  She was far more aggressive in her line of questioning.
[01:26:30.385 --> 01:26:32.227]  She even assumed my guilt.
[01:26:32.227 --> 01:26:34.230]  Now you're finally going to face justice.
[01:26:34.230 --> 01:26:35.531]  That was her words.
[01:26:35.531 --> 01:26:36.853]  She assumed my guilt.
[01:26:36.853 --> 01:26:39.656]  I'm not saying anything she's done there is wrong.
[01:26:39.656 --> 01:26:41.899]  I'm saying that is robust journalism.
[01:26:42.634 --> 01:26:44.115]  That's what we're witnessing.
[01:26:44.115 --> 01:26:45.136]  That's all I've done.
[01:26:45.136 --> 01:26:51.182]  But what she is, is a collaborator with the Islamists and she's got a job to throw your ass in prison.
[01:26:51.182 --> 01:26:54.184]  It's the BBC that famously has always covered up her pedophilia.
[01:26:54.184 --> 01:26:55.566]  That's their known thing.
[01:26:55.566 --> 01:26:58.148]  So she's told, you go stop him.
[01:26:58.148 --> 01:26:59.569]  Please continue.
[01:26:59.569 --> 01:27:05.234]  Even Alex, on Thursday, for the first day of my trial, every single newspaper published a picture of me in court.
[01:27:05.234 --> 01:27:06.455]  Every single one of them.
[01:27:06.455 --> 01:27:09.538]  According to the Attorney General, that is now contempt of court.
[01:27:10.228 --> 01:27:19.651]  We played that video of Lucy Manning in court as evidence, along with many other videos such as Rolf Harris being pretty much crushed by the press on his way into court.
[01:27:19.651 --> 01:27:30.074]  The judge and prosecution completely ignored the fact that every other newspaper and journalist questions and photographs defendants entering court every single day across my country.
[01:27:30.074 --> 01:27:39.777]  But in my specific case, the Attorney General has decided for the first time in British history that when Tommy Robinson politely questions the now convicted Muslim child rapists,
[01:27:40.413 --> 01:27:49.365]  It amounts to contempt of court and it could have interfered with the court proceedings by leaving the defendants in an anxious state of mind.
[01:27:49.365 --> 01:27:54.692]  I knew the entire system was corrupt when the judge unbelievably agreed with the Attorney General.
[01:27:55.393 --> 01:27:57.254]  This has effectively set a precedent.
[01:27:57.254 --> 01:28:00.937]  Questioning any defendant is contempt of court.
[01:28:00.937 --> 01:28:06.541]  Will you ever see another journalist arrested and prosecuted for asking questions or photographing a defendant entering court?
[01:28:06.541 --> 01:28:08.122]  Of course you won't!
[01:28:08.122 --> 01:28:15.607]  The Attorney General spent five months trying to invent something they can fit me up with and therefore this will be a complete one-off.
[01:28:15.607 --> 01:28:18.789]  Designed solely to fit up Tommy Robinson.
[01:28:18.789 --> 01:28:19.570]  Tommy, stay there.
[01:28:20.348 --> 01:28:24.411]  When you come back, I want you to do your appeal directly to the President, but I want to be clear here.
[01:28:24.411 --> 01:28:27.193]  TV viewers can see all this, radio listeners can hear it, it's so shocking.
[01:28:28.197 --> 01:28:29.077]  I think you're wrong, though.
[01:28:29.077 --> 01:28:33.139]  They're sending the President for everybody to be arrested who is a patriot who's in the media.
[01:28:33.139 --> 01:28:35.260]  What they're really doing is outlawing journalism.
[01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:42.703]  And you haven't told people yet how they send antifa to your house, they send the Muslims to your house, saying they're going to acid attack you, threatening your family.
[01:28:42.703 --> 01:28:44.364]  This is your young children, your wife.
[01:28:44.364 --> 01:28:45.544]  You need to get out of there.
[01:28:45.544 --> 01:28:49.005]  You're asking President Trump for emergency journalistic asylum.
[01:28:49.005 --> 01:28:51.486]  You are the textbook case for it.
[01:28:51.486 --> 01:28:52.247]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:52.247 --> 01:28:52.607]  Stay with us.
[01:28:57.809 --> 01:29:02.892]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of BlackRifleRealEstate.com.

[01:31:58.470 --> 01:32:15.135]  I talk about this on the air, and I know it sinks into people, but I've decided that we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements, in that if you go back five, six years ago, before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it, I would talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were, and I'd have doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good.
[01:32:15.135 --> 01:32:19.237]  And instead, the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us, or they'll shut us down.
[01:32:19.237 --> 01:32:22.558]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful they were.
[01:32:22.918 --> 01:32:24.659]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[01:32:24.659 --> 01:32:28.923]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements.
[01:32:28.923 --> 01:32:36.869]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[01:32:36.869 --> 01:32:44.494]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them, and all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things.
[01:32:44.494 --> 01:32:45.675]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[01:32:45.675 --> 01:32:46.476]  They have side effects.
[01:32:46.636 --> 01:32:51.238]  Not with Mother Nature, but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest.
[01:32:51.238 --> 01:32:52.299]  Infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:32:52.299 --> 01:32:54.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:27.236 --> 01:33:29.137]  Well, there's no doubt.
[01:33:29.137 --> 01:33:34.200]  Europe, the UK and the US, to a great extent, is being swallowed up by authoritarianism.
[01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:41.284]  Mass censorship of nationalists, conservatives, Christians, veterans groups, pro-gun groups, pro-life groups.
[01:33:41.284 --> 01:33:49.489]  In the UK, over 10,000 are arrested a year for even having private conversations at restaurants that people hear that can be considered offensive.
[01:33:51.107 --> 01:33:53.668]  An iron fist is crushing the people.
[01:33:53.668 --> 01:33:59.690]  Former members of Al-Qaeda and ISIS, who aren't even born in the UK, are brought back, given free government housing.
[01:33:59.690 --> 01:34:06.052]  Family members of terrorists convicted of bombing people in the UK are given money for their psychological pain, but victims aren't.
[01:34:06.052 --> 01:34:08.413]  That's in the news today.
[01:34:08.413 --> 01:34:11.494]  It's so unspeakable how they rub it in.
[01:34:11.494 --> 01:34:12.914]  It makes the head spin.
[01:34:12.914 --> 01:34:15.795]  Now, Tommy Robinson is doing an emergency appeal to the President.
[01:34:15.795 --> 01:34:17.736]  He's been laying out the evidence of the fraud.
[01:34:18.732 --> 01:34:22.113]  But I was telling him during the break, I said, Tommy, the President's very busy.
[01:34:22.113 --> 01:34:23.433]  I can get this to him.
[01:34:23.433 --> 01:34:25.294]  Tucker Carlson is watching.
[01:34:25.294 --> 01:34:26.394]  I've talked to Tucker.
[01:34:26.394 --> 01:34:28.415]  He's planning to try to get you back on.
[01:34:28.415 --> 01:34:29.815]  But we know you're innocent.
[01:34:29.815 --> 01:34:30.455]  We understand it.
[01:34:30.455 --> 01:34:32.356]  And the White House will want to see all this.
[01:34:32.356 --> 01:34:35.236]  It'll probably be somebody like Stephen Miller that watches it all.
[01:34:35.236 --> 01:34:38.577]  But what I'm saying is, you are a smart guy, well-spoken.
[01:34:38.577 --> 01:34:41.418]  We're going to cut most of myself even out of this when he says the President.
[01:34:42.779 --> 01:34:51.023]  What is your direct appeal about what you're facing, your family's facing, and why you need him to give you emergency asylum, which I think is a very good chance we can get him to do.
[01:34:51.023 --> 01:34:54.024]  It also exposes how corrupt the UK has gotten.
[01:34:54.024 --> 01:34:59.106]  So your upfront message to Trump?
[01:34:59.106 --> 01:35:05.469]  President Trump, the American government, Britain has fallen.
[01:35:05.469 --> 01:35:09.351]  Even yourself, if you was in Britain, you would be arrested and tried.
[01:35:10.071 --> 01:35:13.052]  You would be tried because Sadiq Khan would demand it.
[01:35:13.052 --> 01:35:19.115]  The political pressure that has been put on the judiciary system would be the similar pressure that would be put on for yourself.
[01:35:19.115 --> 01:35:26.078]  I'm an English man, a British citizen who loves my country and it hurts me to have to say I have no future here.
[01:35:26.078 --> 01:35:29.819]  The only future that lies for me is death.
[01:35:29.819 --> 01:35:36.542]  Death at the hands of an establishment who will feed me to Islamic gangs of jihadis within the prison system.
[01:35:36.542 --> 01:35:38.603]  I have 48 hours before my sentencing.
[01:35:39.306 --> 01:35:44.355]  I previously spent three months in solitary confinement for journalism, for breaking no law.
[01:35:44.355 --> 01:35:49.243]  The reality is, and I urge you please, get your lawyers to look through this case.
[01:35:49.243 --> 01:35:51.888]  You will expose and see complete corruption.
[01:35:52.623 --> 01:35:55.304]  I'm being found guilty when I've broke no laws.
[01:35:55.304 --> 01:35:58.546]  I've not been tried by my peers.
[01:35:58.546 --> 01:36:01.367]  Twelve members of the British public, that's the Magna Carta.
[01:36:01.367 --> 01:36:02.828]  That's common law.
[01:36:02.828 --> 01:36:08.531]  Common law is if members of my peers, if the British public find me guilty, I'd accept my fate.
[01:36:08.531 --> 01:36:10.152]  I'm not being tried.
[01:36:10.152 --> 01:36:16.515]  This is a backdoor ruling in order for the government to silence me, imprison me and inevitably have me killed.
[01:36:16.935 --> 01:36:21.579]  I'm a father of three, with three beautiful children, and a wife, and a beautiful wife.
[01:36:21.579 --> 01:36:28.283]  Last time I was in prison, the police went to my family's home to tell them that they had intel that there were going to be acid attacks against them.
[01:36:28.283 --> 01:36:29.845]  They went to my wife, they went to my mother.
[01:36:29.845 --> 01:36:33.827]  They're going to take me away and leave my family vulnerable.
[01:36:33.827 --> 01:36:34.328]  My crime?
[01:36:35.305 --> 01:36:40.730]  Awakening the British public to the mass problems from open border immigration.
[01:36:40.730 --> 01:36:44.214]  Importing a culture of dominance and violence.
[01:36:44.214 --> 01:36:47.637]  And see, the globalists don't want the public to be aware of this.
[01:36:47.637 --> 01:36:53.703]  They don't want people to understand the problems that come with their utopia vision for our world.
[01:36:53.703 --> 01:36:55.044]  I've spoke out.
[01:36:55.044 --> 01:36:56.025]  I've laid my life.
[01:36:56.693 --> 01:37:00.475]  I'm saying to you, I want to keep on fighting, but I can't fight it because I'm going to be killed.
[01:37:00.475 --> 01:37:07.639]  And as a journalist, as a British citizen, I beg you, I beg Donald Trump, I beg the American government, just look at my case.
[01:37:07.639 --> 01:37:11.401]  If you look at my case, you will see the wrongdoings.
[01:37:11.401 --> 01:37:16.043]  My previous, when I tried to fight this case, this is the corruption in this country.
[01:37:16.043 --> 01:37:20.806]  The QC, the Queen's Council who was representing me, told me to do a deal.
[01:37:21.766 --> 01:37:27.829]  And then I was told he didn't want a black mark on his name for fighting my case.
[01:37:27.829 --> 01:37:29.150]  That's his job.
[01:37:29.150 --> 01:37:36.814]  But he wouldn't fight my case to understand the level of political correctness that has infected this once great nation.
[01:37:36.814 --> 01:37:40.696]  We are imprisoning journalists and our media celebrate it.
[01:37:41.425 --> 01:37:47.827]  I'm being imprisoned for asking a convicted paedophile, how do you feel about your verdict?
[01:37:47.827 --> 01:37:49.287]  That is the reality.
[01:37:49.287 --> 01:37:51.408]  My conviction for causing anxiety?
[01:37:51.408 --> 01:37:53.769]  For causing anxiety?
[01:37:53.769 --> 01:37:54.709]  This is even before.
[01:37:54.709 --> 01:38:00.791]  I want to get on to the final charges, but this is a direct appeal on behalf of my family.
[01:38:00.791 --> 01:38:04.812]  On behalf of my family, we love the United States.
[01:38:04.812 --> 01:38:06.352]  I have no future here.
[01:38:06.352 --> 01:38:07.312]  It's inevitable.
[01:38:07.312 --> 01:38:08.113]  I will be murdered.
[01:38:08.113 --> 01:38:08.833]  I will be killed.
[01:38:09.426 --> 01:38:13.652]  And I will be imprisoned on Thursday for journalism.
[01:38:13.652 --> 01:38:16.696]  We talk about North Korea, we talk about China, we talk about Russia.
[01:38:16.696 --> 01:38:18.138]  Our freedoms are gone.
[01:38:18.138 --> 01:38:19.720]  Our free speech is gone.
[01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:20.121]  It's gone.
[01:38:20.121 --> 01:38:21.503]  We live in a post-free speech era.
[01:38:22.262 --> 01:38:27.344]  And exactly the same, what they've inflicted in this nation, I know they want to do to yours.
[01:38:27.344 --> 01:38:30.426]  I know they want to take your freedoms, they want to change your constitution.
[01:38:30.426 --> 01:38:33.487]  I know there's people who would take away your rights tomorrow.
[01:38:33.487 --> 01:38:36.549]  The difference is, they want to do it to you in America.
[01:38:36.549 --> 01:38:38.229]  They've done it to us.
[01:38:38.229 --> 01:38:39.750]  They've done it to us.
[01:38:39.750 --> 01:38:42.251]  Our free speech is gone and it's celebrated.
[01:38:42.251 --> 01:38:46.133]  It's celebrated by the people in power, who rule over us, the globalists.
[01:38:46.133 --> 01:38:47.834]  It's celebrated.
[01:38:47.834 --> 01:38:50.275]  It's celebrated when a journalist is being imprisoned.
[01:38:50.976 --> 01:38:54.539]  The media, they're not journalists, they're activists!
[01:38:54.539 --> 01:39:00.443]  The globalist corporate media, and they've been used as attack dogs against me.
[01:39:00.443 --> 01:39:03.585]  I just, I make this as a direct appeal.
[01:39:03.585 --> 01:39:10.990]  I ask American citizens, please make sure somehow, I ask Alex Jones, I ask anyone, make sure this lands in the American government.
[01:39:10.990 --> 01:39:17.155]  I know that when I was taken and kidnapped off the street and unlawfully held, which has been proven, I know,
[01:39:17.972 --> 01:39:20.715]  That congressman from the Republican Party stepped in.
[01:39:20.715 --> 01:39:23.457]  I know that pressure was put on the British government.
[01:39:23.457 --> 01:39:25.279]  I'm telling you now, it's not pressure that's needed.
[01:39:25.279 --> 01:39:27.781]  I need evacuation out of this country.
[01:39:27.781 --> 01:39:31.784]  Because there are people and dark forces at work in this nation.
[01:39:31.784 --> 01:39:37.730]  The same dark forces at work in this nation that want to repel you as the leader of the free world from even entering this country.
[01:39:38.567 --> 01:39:43.728]  There are many people in this country who would want to seek the same against you that they seek against me.
[01:39:43.728 --> 01:39:45.368]  The same lies that are told about you.
[01:39:45.368 --> 01:39:47.289]  I have to fight these lies.
[01:39:47.289 --> 01:39:51.030]  I've fought these lies as a young working class man from a town in England.
[01:39:51.030 --> 01:39:56.171]  I've had to fight against the labelling, against the stigma, the Nazi, the racist, the fascist.
[01:39:56.171 --> 01:39:59.451]  All the words used to destroy a man's reputation.
[01:39:59.451 --> 01:40:02.092]  I've had to fight and fight and fight as a single individual.
[01:40:02.975 --> 01:40:11.642]  And right now I'm about to be imprisoned and I'm saying if you care about freedom like I know you do, I know America loves freedom, I know you'll fight for it and die for it and so would we.
[01:40:11.642 --> 01:40:12.884]  Ours is gone.
[01:40:12.884 --> 01:40:14.004]  It's gone.
[01:40:14.004 --> 01:40:15.766]  The country's fallen.
[01:40:15.766 --> 01:40:21.811]  Everything you've watched, as I go through the details in this case, you will see that every word I'm saying is true.
[01:40:21.811 --> 01:40:22.552]  It's factual.
[01:40:22.552 --> 01:40:25.394]  They're going against the law of the land.
[01:40:25.394 --> 01:40:28.397]  They are not judging or sentencing by the law of the land.
[01:40:29.759 --> 01:40:31.821]  Tommy, Tommy, I want you to add just one point.
[01:40:31.821 --> 01:40:38.187]  If you want to talk about yourself, there's hundreds of these videos of them assaulting you and your family in the park, in public.
[01:40:38.187 --> 01:40:39.989]  Then the police always come and say you're the bad guy.
[01:40:39.989 --> 01:40:46.716]  People talk about how the Antifa came to your house saying they're going to attack your family, trying to trick you to defend your family so they can put you back in prison.
[01:40:46.716 --> 01:40:49.118]  Tell the President some of the other things they've done to you and your family.
[01:40:50.306 --> 01:40:56.889]  To the President, I have this label, people want to label me, label me, with all these different labels.
[01:40:56.889 --> 01:41:00.110]  The difference is, I walk the streets of the UK.
[01:41:00.110 --> 01:41:04.151]  I am as well known in my country, and I'm loved and I'm hated.
[01:41:04.151 --> 01:41:09.753]  A very similar situation to you, Mr President, to Donald Trump in America.
[01:41:09.753 --> 01:41:11.394]  I don't have security.
[01:41:11.394 --> 01:41:13.434]  I walk every day on my own.
[01:41:13.434 --> 01:41:14.635]  I walk everywhere on my own.
[01:41:15.262 --> 01:41:19.224]  I don't have the money to fund a security fund to continue it.
[01:41:19.224 --> 01:41:21.525]  You see Nigel Farage in this country.
[01:41:21.525 --> 01:41:24.026]  He wouldn't last one day walking the streets.
[01:41:24.026 --> 01:41:26.487]  He would not last one day without his protection.
[01:41:26.487 --> 01:41:28.448]  I walk them every day.
[01:41:28.448 --> 01:41:35.171]  I walk them every single day with conviction and my head held high for what I stand for and for what I want.
[01:41:35.171 --> 01:41:38.212]  And I say that everything has been thrown at me.
[01:41:38.212 --> 01:41:39.493]  And what I realise now
[01:41:40.345 --> 01:41:43.147]  It's that my government don't care if the world's watching.
[01:41:43.147 --> 01:41:45.188]  They don't care if they're breaking the law.
[01:41:45.188 --> 01:41:45.808]  They don't care.
[01:41:45.808 --> 01:41:51.392]  And on Thursday I will be, what I'd say, is sentenced to death.
[01:41:51.392 --> 01:41:56.415]  Every single prison in this country is overrun and controlled by jihadi gangs.
[01:41:56.415 --> 01:41:58.176]  By jihadi gangs.
[01:41:58.176 --> 01:42:03.779]  I'm saying to the world watching.
[01:42:04.824 --> 01:42:14.988]  If this was happening to a journalist in any other country, in China, in Russia, in North Korea, human rights lawyers would be fighting to defend them.
[01:42:14.988 --> 01:42:17.109]  Political correctness is that powerful in this country?
[01:42:17.109 --> 01:42:20.550]  I can't find a human rights lawyer to defend me or even mention me.
[01:42:20.550 --> 01:42:25.432]  Every time we speak to lawyers about anything, as soon as they hear it's my name, nope, we walk away.
[01:42:25.432 --> 01:42:29.373]  Even getting an affidavit signed last week by a law firm.
[01:42:29.373 --> 01:42:31.654]  I went to sign a law firm, when they see it was me, nope.
[01:42:32.293 --> 01:42:34.495]  That is the power of political correctness.
[01:42:34.495 --> 01:42:37.137]  That is how infected my nation is.
[01:42:37.137 --> 01:42:39.980]  And I'm appealing to you directly for help.
[01:42:39.980 --> 01:42:42.542]  I'm appealing to you for help on the side of freedom.
[01:42:42.542 --> 01:42:43.423]  Tommy, stay there.
[01:42:43.423 --> 01:42:47.827]  We're going to come back and then go for the White House lawyers into the evidence.
[01:42:47.827 --> 01:42:51.390]  We're live and I'm going to take this and put this up front and all your evidence after.
[01:42:51.390 --> 01:42:54.093]  The President will definitely see the first five minutes of this.
[01:42:54.093 --> 01:42:55.454]  I can assure you of that, my friend.
[01:42:55.454 --> 01:42:56.094]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:56.094 --> 01:42:56.435]  Stay with us.
[01:42:58.157 --> 01:43:02.463]  I just want listeners to understand, money is what allows us to beat this and stand against this.
[01:43:02.463 --> 01:43:10.133]  And we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the Save Info Wars 50% off, but we make only like $5, $10 on higher marked up stuff.
[01:43:10.133 --> 01:43:13.017]  We're making like $2 on the toothpaste at that price, and we're moving it.
[01:43:13.357 --> 01:43:14.018]  I don't know.
[01:43:32.799 --> 01:43:33.760]  I like to be expanding.
[01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:34.520]  I like to be winning.
[01:43:34.520 --> 01:43:35.241]  I like to be fighting.
[01:43:35.241 --> 01:43:36.442]  And we are winning the Infowar.
[01:43:36.442 --> 01:43:37.303]  That's why we're so hated.
[01:43:37.303 --> 01:43:38.924]  But we need to be retreaded.
[01:43:38.924 --> 01:43:40.185]  We need to be tuned up.
[01:43:40.185 --> 01:43:41.206]  We need to be fixed up.
[01:43:41.206 --> 01:43:42.527]  We never have time to get in the dry dock.
[01:43:42.527 --> 01:43:44.068]  We got a lot of holes shot at us.
[01:43:44.068 --> 01:43:46.390]  And the enemy wants to silence us.
[01:43:46.390 --> 01:43:48.912]  Then they're really going to plant child porn on us.
[01:43:48.912 --> 01:43:50.913]  Then they're going to kill me, or you, or anybody else.
[01:43:50.913 --> 01:43:53.755]  I mean, the Democrats now are going into a full revolutionary fervor.
[01:43:53.755 --> 01:43:55.196]  Funded by foreign banks and the TICOM.
[01:43:55.196 --> 01:43:56.858]  So, go to InfowarStore.com.
[01:43:57.765 --> 01:43:59.726]  Briefly, folks, please do not forget.
[01:43:59.726 --> 01:44:00.906]  This is the maximum alert.
[01:44:00.906 --> 01:44:02.067]  We wouldn't be here without you.
[01:44:02.067 --> 01:44:03.467]  I thank you for your support and your help.
[01:44:03.467 --> 01:44:06.608]  We're going to be steadfast in this fight, but we need financial support.
[01:44:06.608 --> 01:44:09.749]  And we're going to put up more prominent donate buttons at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:44:09.749 --> 01:44:11.630]  You want to just give us straight donations.
[01:44:11.630 --> 01:44:12.170]  There's a P.O.
[01:44:12.170 --> 01:44:13.431]  box if you want to mail us a check.
[01:44:13.431 --> 01:44:15.231]  We will put it into the fight against these globalists.
[01:44:15.231 --> 01:44:16.692]  We need money to fight back.
[01:44:16.852 --> 01:44:19.514]  And to let them know we're taking action and to defend ourselves.
[01:44:19.514 --> 01:44:22.416]  InfoWarsStore.com is the main page.
[01:44:22.416 --> 01:44:23.817]  We have a huge sale going.
[01:44:23.817 --> 01:44:24.938]  Save InfoWars.
[01:44:24.938 --> 01:44:25.878]  Super special.
[01:44:25.878 --> 01:44:27.400]  Emergency special.
[01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:27.760]  50% off.
[01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:30.162]  All InfoWars best-selling live products.

[01:44:31.262 --> 01:44:32.423]  That's Super Mel Vitality.
[01:44:32.423 --> 01:44:33.524]  Survival Shield X2.
[01:44:33.524 --> 01:44:34.365]  Now back in stock.
[01:44:34.365 --> 01:44:35.445]  RainForce Plus.
[01:44:35.445 --> 01:44:36.246]  TurboForce.
[01:44:36.246 --> 01:44:37.687]  Potty's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[01:44:37.887 --> 01:44:41.629]  We're getting a lot of support right now, but we need a lot to go into this dark night.
[01:44:41.629 --> 01:44:42.449]  We're not going to back down.
[01:44:59.088 --> 01:45:14.999]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena, in the public square, the other thing that's unique about InfoWars is it is the only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed by some billionaire, that's not being funded by a secret foreign government.
[01:45:14.999 --> 01:45:16.700]  It is completely independent of all that.
[01:45:16.700 --> 01:45:27.608]  It is an old-school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country, they actually tried to
[01:45:27.788 --> 01:45:28.328]  We're good to go.
[01:45:47.782 --> 01:45:48.463]  I don't know.
[01:46:00.211 --> 01:46:04.335]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:46:04.335 --> 01:46:07.477]  Viewers and listeners, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.
[01:46:07.477 --> 01:46:10.640]  And we're under unprecedented evil attacks as you've seen.
[01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:22.870]  But I wanted to take just a minute out here from the bottom of my heart to tell you how much it means to me that when you saw those lies against us last week, the worst things you can say about people that you knew they were liars, you went and looked it up and found out the truth.
[01:46:22.870 --> 01:46:28.014]  And so I feel very strong and I feel God's hand on my shoulder and I feel your love in my heart.
[01:46:28.014 --> 01:46:29.255]  And I want you to know that love is right back
[01:46:29.275 --> 01:46:30.935]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:47:01.781 --> 01:47:16.428]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:16.428 --> 01:47:20.831]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:47:20.831 --> 01:47:26.473]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:47:28.413 --> 01:47:33.395]  Here's Frederica Wilson last week calling for anyone that makes fun of a Democrat to be arrested.
[01:47:33.395 --> 01:47:35.796]  By the way, more and more Democrats are saying this.
[01:47:35.796 --> 01:47:37.857]  They're saying, arrest Alex Jones.
[01:47:37.857 --> 01:47:39.618]  Arrest Donald Trump.
[01:47:39.618 --> 01:47:43.440]  They are arresting journalists in Europe and in the UK.
[01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:45.521]  And Tommy Robinson is a folk hero over there, folks.
[01:47:45.521 --> 01:47:46.501]  He's well known here.
[01:47:46.501 --> 01:47:49.403]  Very, like, more famous than I am here in the U.S.
[01:47:49.403 --> 01:47:51.444]  He is over there and loved.
[01:47:51.444 --> 01:47:53.865]  That's why they're hell-bent on destroying him.
[01:47:53.865 --> 01:47:56.346]  Let's go to what the Congresswoman said just last week.
[01:47:57.230 --> 01:48:06.277]  Those people who are online making fun of members of Congress are a disgrace.
[01:48:06.277 --> 01:48:11.481]  And there's no need for anyone to think that is unacceptable.
[01:48:11.481 --> 01:48:17.686]  We're going to shut them down and work with whoever it is to shut them down and they should be prosecuted.
[01:48:18.934 --> 01:48:32.531]  So, this is bigger than Tommy Robinson, who's a great hero and a good friend of mine, and if you don't know his whole history, you have a best-selling book about an action hero or something, and it would seem just unbelievable, but truth is stranger than fiction.
[01:48:32.531 --> 01:48:35.434]  We won't be able to operate, though, if we don't have funding, so let me just briefly say this.
[01:48:36.243 --> 01:48:40.107]  This is the last day of the Save Info Awards July 4th special.
[01:48:40.107 --> 01:48:40.988]  This will be the last day.
[01:48:40.988 --> 01:48:42.050]  New specials tomorrow.
[01:48:42.050 --> 01:48:44.432]  But this is one of our most biggest and most extensive ever.
[01:48:44.432 --> 01:48:50.579]  Storewide free shipping, double pay for your points, and 50% off all of our best-selling supplements.
[01:48:50.579 --> 01:48:52.702]  That's the brain force, the turbo force, the...
[01:48:53.803 --> 01:49:02.190]  Survival Shield X2, the Superdome Vitality, the amazing Fluoride Free Toothpaste, Super Blue, Fortified with Colloidal Silver and Iodine, and your purchase makes it all possible.
[01:49:02.190 --> 01:49:03.451]  And one other interesting issue.
[01:49:03.451 --> 01:49:07.634]  You know, we do limited edition t-shirts, and sometimes we only sell like 500 of one.
[01:49:07.634 --> 01:49:11.197]  Sometimes we sell a couple thousand, sometimes we sell 20-30 thousand.
[01:49:11.197 --> 01:49:12.338]  That helps fund things.
[01:49:12.338 --> 01:49:14.099]  It takes a lot of money to run this.
[01:49:14.099 --> 01:49:19.424]  I've got some big exciting operations that we won't get credit for, but that's not what this is about.
[01:49:19.965 --> 01:49:22.071]  Oh, it's not just what you see here.
[01:49:22.071 --> 01:49:23.757]  A lot of stuff you see out there.
[01:49:25.385 --> 01:49:26.506]  Other folks are getting credit for it.
[01:49:26.506 --> 01:49:27.726]  I don't want the credit.
[01:49:27.726 --> 01:49:31.348]  Submarines run silent, run deadly, run deep.
[01:49:31.348 --> 01:49:33.829]  And what you see here is just the tip of the iceberg.
[01:49:33.829 --> 01:49:35.190]  I will assure you.
[01:49:35.190 --> 01:49:39.913]  I need warfare operation funds if you want me to go out and destroy the globalists politically.
[01:49:39.913 --> 01:49:42.434]  I can destroy them with your help.
[01:49:42.434 --> 01:49:43.995]  We've already gone so far together.
[01:49:43.995 --> 01:49:44.995]  We've already paid a lot.
[01:49:44.995 --> 01:49:46.916]  They're trying to plant child porn on me now.
[01:49:46.916 --> 01:49:48.217]  You know all about it all.
[01:49:48.217 --> 01:49:49.698]  And I've seen a lot of support come in since then.
[01:49:49.698 --> 01:49:51.378]  People are like, oh my God.
[01:49:51.378 --> 01:49:52.159]  Exactly, folks.
[01:49:52.159 --> 01:49:53.660]  This is hard core.
[01:49:54.497 --> 01:49:56.798]  Of course they got caught, the fact that it was all a lie.
[01:49:56.798 --> 01:50:00.279]  But this is such a dangerous time.
[01:50:00.279 --> 01:50:01.920]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:50:01.920 --> 01:50:03.260]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:50:03.260 --> 01:50:07.142]  Tommy can tell you, I'm not bragging, this is at times that he's needed money.
[01:50:08.126 --> 01:50:09.827]  For what he's going on.
[01:50:09.827 --> 01:50:10.127]  Hey, $30,000.
[01:50:10.127 --> 01:50:10.968]  Boom!
[01:50:10.968 --> 01:50:16.492]  And a lot of other folks you don't know about that I send checks a lot bigger than that to for their strategic operations.
[01:50:16.492 --> 01:50:19.554]  So, you have to understand, the enemy wants me off the air for good reason.
[01:50:19.554 --> 01:50:25.938]  Because they don't want me to have contact with you to get funding that we then turn loose to others with no strings attached.
[01:50:25.938 --> 01:50:28.460]  Because we already know they've done a great job.
[01:50:28.460 --> 01:50:29.600]  I'm trying to run a war here.
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:30.461]  I'm trying to win.
[01:50:30.461 --> 01:50:31.702]  I believe in you.
[01:50:31.702 --> 01:50:35.064]  And your purchases now are critical.
[01:50:35.064 --> 01:50:36.025]  The Betsy Ross flag.
[01:50:37.782 --> 01:50:40.906]  Which, Nike's pulled off her sayings racist, even though she was an abolitionist.
[01:50:40.906 --> 01:50:43.749]  You know, that's the group that got slavery banned.
[01:50:43.749 --> 01:50:45.250]  She designed the American flag, she's amazing.
[01:50:46.226 --> 01:50:47.127]  They're pulling it everywhere.
[01:50:47.127 --> 01:50:47.727]  Well, guess what?
[01:50:47.727 --> 01:50:53.012]  I had an idea that if we put out a limited edition shirt, they've now arrived, they're shipping out now, that you'd like it.
[01:50:53.012 --> 01:51:00.277]  One is the Betsy Ross flag, was 1776, founded 1776, on the back it says America's Back, Infowars.com, people love it.
[01:51:00.277 --> 01:51:03.000]  The other one is even a better seller, they're about to sell out.
[01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:06.242]  I said, I'm only printing 4,000, I thought it would take a month to sell that many.
[01:51:06.242 --> 01:51:08.064]  We've already sold out 2,000 as of this morning.
[01:51:09.246 --> 01:51:11.367]  So a lot of sizes are about to be gone.
[01:51:11.367 --> 01:51:13.429]  Then we have the other one that's white.
[01:51:13.429 --> 01:51:15.990]  It says America's Back, Infowars.com on the back.
[01:51:15.990 --> 01:51:20.253]  On the front, the Betsy Ross flag, big across the chest, and these colors don't run.
[01:51:20.253 --> 01:51:22.555]  And that's the one that's selling out so quick.
[01:51:22.555 --> 01:51:26.297]  Don't worry, it's so popular, I'm gonna make a new limited edition after this, okay?
[01:51:26.297 --> 01:51:28.219]  And we'll have 10,000 of those.
[01:51:28.219 --> 01:51:29.219]  You're like, well, that'll be a lot of money.
[01:51:29.219 --> 01:51:31.941]  Yeah, it takes a ton more.
[01:51:31.941 --> 01:51:34.863]  We have sold 100,000 t-shirts before of Hillary for President.
[01:51:36.221 --> 01:51:37.922]  Alex, first of all, what you were saying.
[01:52:02.378 --> 01:52:08.887]  You actually financially contributed to some of the equipment we would have been using on the day for this case.
[01:52:08.887 --> 01:52:09.588]  So thank you.
[01:52:09.588 --> 01:52:13.213]  And also, you know, I'm reaching out to the United States.
[01:52:13.213 --> 01:52:19.242]  There's been an organization in the United States, the Middle East Forum, who have also funded our fight for free speech in the UK.
[01:52:20.020 --> 01:52:26.283]  They've funded and tried to fight and have me released and continue to fight my legal battles with me.
[01:52:26.283 --> 01:52:27.343]  So a thank you to them.
[01:52:27.343 --> 01:52:34.126]  I know so many Americans step forward when they see our freedoms are disappearing and that our people are under attack.
[01:52:34.126 --> 01:52:35.927]  I want to address the final charge.
[01:52:35.927 --> 01:52:38.828]  The breach in the Section 4.2 reporting restriction.
[01:52:39.696 --> 01:52:43.397]  Previously, I was ignorant to the rules around reporting restrictions and rules around court.
[01:52:43.397 --> 01:52:44.438]  I'm a citizen journalist.
[01:52:44.438 --> 01:52:45.118]  I hadn't studied.
[01:52:45.118 --> 01:52:46.618]  I hadn't been to university.
[01:52:46.618 --> 01:52:53.081]  So I began to learn and I paid privately to go to one of London's leading law firms, Kingsley Napoli.
[01:52:53.081 --> 01:52:56.822]  I went for training on contempt of court, for training on reporting restrictions.
[01:52:56.822 --> 01:53:01.664]  I went, I learned, I downloaded and read the judiciary's own paper.
[01:53:01.664 --> 01:53:04.445]  It's called the Reporting Restrictions in the Criminal Courts.
[01:53:04.445 --> 01:53:07.986]  It's available to download on the judiciary's own website, their website.
[01:53:08.607 --> 01:53:23.871]  In fact, the Lord Chief Justice himself, the lead of our courts, he introduces this report stating that it's a practical guide for judges and the media on the statutory and common law principles which should be applied with regards to reporting restriction.
[01:53:23.871 --> 01:53:29.513]  All you have to do is go on Google, put in reporting restrictions criminal courts, you'll find it, it's the top link, okay?
[01:53:29.513 --> 01:53:33.054]  Now, let me read for you what it says, yeah?
[01:53:34.142 --> 01:53:40.926]  Any reporting restriction imposes potential criminal liability on media organisations, journalists or editors who breach it.
[01:53:40.926 --> 01:53:45.128]  If a breach occurs, media organisations and their employees may face unlimited fines.
[01:53:45.128 --> 01:53:46.629]  Don't mention a prison!
[01:53:46.629 --> 01:53:53.153]  For these reasons, it is essential that any reporting restriction should be reduced to writing as soon as possible.
[01:53:53.153 --> 01:53:58.316]  It should be clear and precise and in terms and drawn up as a court order as soon as practicable.
[01:54:00.544 --> 01:54:14.011]  Once orders have been made, they should be drawn to the attention of the media by being shown on the court list and on the door of the court, and wherever possible, sent to relevant local or national media organisations.
[01:54:14.011 --> 01:54:23.015]  Court staff should respond positively to media organisations' requests for assistance in relation to the existence of terms of a reporting restriction.
[01:54:23.015 --> 01:54:24.076]  Okay?
[01:54:24.076 --> 01:54:28.218]  Now, let me show you the court listings
[01:54:28.985 --> 01:54:33.971]  From the day before I went to court that day.
[01:54:33.971 --> 01:54:39.238]  Clearly, this is the court listings from the day before.
[01:54:39.238 --> 01:54:48.449]  As you can see from the online court listing the day before, they mention that the jury had retired, but crucially there's no mention of any reporting restrictions in place.
[01:54:49.272 --> 01:54:51.153]  Clearly, it's not there.
[01:54:51.153 --> 01:54:56.234]  This is a screenshot that I took when we were researching for this case.
[01:54:56.234 --> 01:55:00.615]  Now, of course, this led me to think the trial had finished, the jury's retired.
[01:55:00.615 --> 01:55:04.796]  Maybe the strict restrictions have been lifted.
[01:55:04.796 --> 01:55:08.397]  When I turned up to court that morning, I went into court.
[01:55:08.397 --> 01:55:12.238]  I asked a member of staff if there was still a reporting restriction on this case.
[01:55:12.238 --> 01:55:15.119]  The prosecution's own witness confirmed this in court.
[01:55:15.894 --> 01:55:19.115]  He told me he didn't know of any reporting restriction on the case.
[01:55:19.115 --> 01:55:26.177]  He did not provide me with the details as he is required to do by the judiciary's own guidelines.
[01:55:26.177 --> 01:55:29.938]  Now my cameraman also went into court and took a picture of the screen.
[01:55:29.938 --> 01:55:36.620]  He looked at the court door, both of which had no notification of any reporting restriction.
[01:55:37.392 --> 01:55:44.296]  The Attorney General read my statement, because with a civil case, I had to give my statement three or four weeks prior to court.
[01:55:44.296 --> 01:55:50.959]  I told them, you didn't have report restrictions on the screen, on the door, you had no report restrictions anywhere visible, okay?
[01:55:50.959 --> 01:55:57.203]  Because of that, the Attorney General got a statement trying to disprove me by interviewing the manager of Leeds Crown Court.
[01:55:57.984 --> 01:56:02.486]  Unfortunately for the prosecution, she actually confirmed everything I said.
[01:56:02.486 --> 01:56:07.308]  In her own words, they had failed to adhere to the legal guidelines.
[01:56:07.308 --> 01:56:16.012]  In fact, the details of the reporting restrictions were never ever once loaded onto the court system during the entirety of the six-week trial.
[01:56:16.012 --> 01:56:18.333]  Now, let me show you this.
[01:56:18.333 --> 01:56:21.434]  This is the... This is...
[01:56:22.757 --> 01:56:24.638]  The Law Commission, the British Law Commission.
[01:56:24.638 --> 01:56:31.242]  So the Attorney General in 2014 asked the Law Commission to do an investigation into contempt of court.
[01:56:31.242 --> 01:56:32.883]  Let me read, so this is in there.
[01:56:32.883 --> 01:56:46.430]  It is now standard practice that any reporting restriction is shown on the Crown Court list under the name of the relevant case, allowing a ready means of checking whether there are such restrictions in place.
[01:56:46.430 --> 01:56:49.832]  Now that's exact, I've just showed you it wasn't on there, okay, I've showed you.
[01:56:49.832 --> 01:56:50.352]  Now in March 2014,
[01:56:52.382 --> 01:57:07.086]  The Law Commission recommended that there should be a single publicly accessible website enabling the media and members of the public to find out if an order has been made under section 42 of the Contempt of Court Act 1991.
[01:57:07.086 --> 01:57:16.629]  This website should include a restricted area where for a charge certain users could find out the details of the reporting restriction and could sign up for automated alerts of new orders.
[01:57:17.495 --> 01:57:21.398]  At the time of writing this, this website has not been established.
[01:57:21.398 --> 01:57:22.238]  Tommy, stay there.
[01:57:22.238 --> 01:57:23.419]  Tommy, stay there.
[01:57:23.419 --> 01:57:29.003]  The point is, is that reporting restrictions are on things like a trial about nuclear weapons or national security.
[01:57:29.003 --> 01:57:33.667]  But they didn't even have one for this child molester thing they're trying to protect, which you've been proven right.
[01:57:33.667 --> 01:57:34.788]  You're the hero.
[01:57:34.788 --> 01:57:35.808]  And so they just make it up.
[01:57:35.808 --> 01:57:40.292]  Another reason they're throwing you in prison is saying you violated a restriction that didn't exist.
[01:57:40.292 --> 01:57:43.674]  The truth is you're a political prisoner about to be sent back to solitary confinement.
[01:57:43.674 --> 01:57:45.715]  You need to be evacuated to the United States with your family.
[01:57:45.715 --> 01:57:46.176]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:47.165 --> 01:57:51.328]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[01:57:51.328 --> 01:57:52.389]  They are technocrats.
[01:57:52.389 --> 01:57:54.691]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[01:57:54.691 --> 01:58:02.057]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life, make your own decisions, gets in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[01:58:02.057 --> 01:58:03.918]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[01:58:03.918 --> 01:58:06.020]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[01:58:06.520 --> 01:58:12.862]  One of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[01:58:12.862 --> 01:58:18.064]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4warslife.com, I couldn't do it.
[01:58:18.064 --> 01:58:27.067]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality medical bottlement and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[01:58:28.047 --> 01:58:34.031]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over-the-counter that you're going to find anywhere.
[01:58:34.031 --> 01:58:34.972]  It is amazing.
[01:58:34.972 --> 01:58:44.959]  Experience pure Methylcobalamin B12 for yourself and fund the Second American Revolution against the tyrants at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:58:48.473 --> 01:58:49.814]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[01:58:49.814 --> 01:58:50.574]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[01:58:50.574 --> 01:58:51.154]  Thanks for holding.
[01:58:51.154 --> 01:58:51.695]  Hey, Alex.
[01:58:51.695 --> 01:58:54.516]  Yeah, I just want to say, uh, your show is a breath of fresh air.
[01:58:54.516 --> 01:59:00.640]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City, and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[01:59:00.640 --> 01:59:08.744]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public.
[01:59:08.744 --> 01:59:09.365]  The approaching 2020.
[01:59:09.365 --> 01:59:10.585]  That's it.
[01:59:10.585 --> 01:59:13.247]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[01:59:13.247 --> 01:59:16.088]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[01:59:16.088 --> 01:59:17.369]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[01:59:17.549 --> 01:59:18.289]  I agree entirely.
[01:59:18.289 --> 01:59:23.731]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[01:59:23.731 --> 01:59:26.532]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[01:59:26.532 --> 01:59:28.592]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[01:59:28.592 --> 01:59:37.835]  But if they do shut you down, know you've gone into this war, you've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[01:59:37.835 --> 01:59:39.736]  We're going to keep fighting in the info war.
[01:59:39.736 --> 01:59:46.238]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[01:59:46.238 --> 01:59:47.158]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[01:59:51.232 --> 02:00:05.780]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:05.780 --> 02:00:07.221]  Carpe D'Angems coming up.
[02:00:07.221 --> 02:00:08.982]  Fresh off his White House visit.
[02:00:08.982 --> 02:00:10.143]  First look at what's coming up.
[02:00:10.143 --> 02:00:16.887]  The big summit on memes, war, and social media this Thursday at the White House.
[02:00:16.887 --> 02:00:18.288]  And I know
[02:00:20.720 --> 02:00:23.862]  Well, more than 10 people that are going to be at the conference.
[02:00:23.862 --> 02:00:26.124]  They're going to have breakaways with the President.
[02:00:26.124 --> 02:00:30.427]  McCarpe has already been summoned there for a long 20 minute meeting with the President.
[02:00:30.427 --> 02:00:34.470]  I'll show you some of those photos and more, but a lot of interesting things to talk about.
[02:00:34.470 --> 02:00:37.132]  Some on record, some off record, but a lot of interesting things are happening.
[02:00:38.513 --> 02:00:43.777]  You know, I physically get, not even angry, but vicious.
[02:00:43.777 --> 02:00:48.961]  Just really focused when I hear about things like this because I know Tommy's telling the whole truth.
[02:00:48.961 --> 02:00:50.142]  He's got all the proof.
[02:00:50.142 --> 02:00:50.943]  I've lived through this.
[02:00:50.943 --> 02:00:53.325]  I've already gone through some of the things he's gone through.
[02:00:53.325 --> 02:00:56.468]  Nothing is bad, but I understand I'm going down that same road.
[02:00:56.468 --> 02:00:59.430]  That's what empathy is, you know, when you see a squirrel run over.
[02:00:59.430 --> 02:00:59.990]  It's a squirrel.
[02:00:59.990 --> 02:01:00.771]  You still feel bad?
[02:01:00.771 --> 02:01:03.833]  Boy, I bet having its back broke really, you know, really hurts.
[02:01:05.154 --> 02:01:06.795]  I hope it dies quickly.
[02:01:06.795 --> 02:01:19.398]  Well, what about watching a journalist who's a hero who exposed giant child kidnapping rings, and they're busting thousands of these men, sending them to prison, and the government is so pissed about it that they want to put Tommy Robinson in prison.
[02:01:19.398 --> 02:01:23.799]  They already put him in there for a year, then three months in solitary.
[02:01:23.799 --> 02:01:26.640]  The collaboration of the people in the British government
[02:01:27.859 --> 02:01:29.381]  The UK government is astounding.
[02:01:29.381 --> 02:01:36.288]  We've got a few minutes in this segment, a little bit more time than Carpe's coming on, but you're going through your evidence here, and I think everybody understands.
[02:01:36.288 --> 02:01:37.749]  No reporting restrictions.
[02:01:37.749 --> 02:01:39.191]  They've still convicted you of that.
[02:01:39.191 --> 02:01:41.813]  It's just total criminal fraud.
[02:01:41.813 --> 02:01:44.816]  And as you said, it's because the UK is so compromised.
[02:01:44.816 --> 02:01:46.598]  Go ahead.
[02:01:46.598 --> 02:01:49.081]  The contempt of court law is out of doubt.
[02:01:49.081 --> 02:01:51.083]  It was set before the invention of the internet.
[02:01:51.969 --> 02:02:04.034]  The high degree of confusion around the guidelines to reporting restrictions led the Law Commission to conduct a six-month review and a recommendation paper in 2014 specifically about contempt of court.
[02:02:04.034 --> 02:02:11.956]  The Law Commission found that the rules and guidelines are extremely confusing and could lead to a journalist mistakenly landing in contempt of court.
[02:02:11.956 --> 02:02:15.978]  Their sole recommendation, their one recommendation from their six-month review of the government,
[02:02:16.627 --> 02:02:21.630]  ...was to create one national website that all the details for trials and reporting restrictions are placed.
[02:02:21.630 --> 02:02:25.112]  That would allow the media, that would allow journalists, members of the public, access.
[02:02:25.112 --> 02:02:29.014]  So if I wanted to go up to a court case, I'd go on one national website... But Tommy, Tommy, stop right there.
[02:02:29.014 --> 02:02:30.135]  Listen.
[02:02:30.135 --> 02:02:33.817]  We all know they abuse the Contempt of Court rule and they use it to protect pedophiles.
[02:02:33.817 --> 02:02:34.938]  That's been all over mainstream news.
[02:02:35.538 --> 02:02:36.799]  Everybody gets that at the White House.
[02:02:36.799 --> 02:02:39.701]  I want you to get into some of the other things and the reason you need to be brought in.
[02:02:39.701 --> 02:02:41.302]  Because obviously you're a journalist.
[02:02:41.302 --> 02:02:42.443]  They're kangarooing you.
[02:02:42.443 --> 02:02:43.904]  You don't get a jury trial.
[02:02:43.904 --> 02:02:45.105]  You're a national hero.
[02:02:45.105 --> 02:02:46.526]  We need you here.
[02:02:46.526 --> 02:02:48.568]  Hell, if you get to the U.S., you can have a show right here.
[02:02:48.568 --> 02:02:50.449]  We'll get you a work visa.
[02:02:50.449 --> 02:02:56.514]  I know because of your prior convictions of the other fake stuff for journalism, it's even harder for you to get a visa to the U.S.
[02:02:56.514 --> 02:02:58.095]  Well, hell, the liberals do it.
[02:02:58.095 --> 02:03:00.357]  We'll just march your ass across the Rio Grande.
[02:03:00.357 --> 02:03:01.898]  I bet the Border Patrol will turn a blind eye.
[02:03:02.599 --> 02:03:02.939]  I don't know.
[02:03:18.191 --> 02:03:27.382]  I just, we need, you need to file for asylum now and bring this up in court as well and just say, listen, you can have the country, Islam's got it, bye bye, and just let them know you want to leave.
[02:03:27.382 --> 02:03:28.723]  But see, they want to kill your ass.
[02:03:28.723 --> 02:03:32.648]  But see, that takes their plum away.
[02:03:32.648 --> 02:03:36.973]  Because if you make a big political issue as you are now, they won't have their big victory.
[02:03:38.869 --> 02:03:43.394]  Alex, the whole reason for all of this is a cover-up.
[02:03:43.394 --> 02:03:46.017]  The whole reason is not wanting the public to realise.
[02:03:46.017 --> 02:03:52.104]  For example, that law commission, it's simple, it's very sensible and it's extremely easy to implement.
[02:03:52.104 --> 02:03:53.125]  One website.
[02:03:53.125 --> 02:03:55.648]  Why won't they produce one website so journalists can go on?
[02:03:55.648 --> 02:03:56.790]  Because if they did,
[02:03:57.510 --> 02:04:07.194]  Anyone could go on and they would see the amount of secret trials of Muslim rape gangs in every single town and city's court across our entire width of this country.
[02:04:07.194 --> 02:04:10.976]  The public would then realise just how many of these cases there are.
[02:04:10.976 --> 02:04:17.579]  Because every single one of these cases now is given a reporting restriction preventing anyone talking about it.
[02:04:18.039 --> 02:04:19.919]  That's the reality of what it is.
[02:04:19.919 --> 02:04:25.081]  So that is exactly why they haven't implemented that.
[02:04:25.081 --> 02:04:30.422]  This was their sole recommendation from a report by the Law Commission for the Attorney General.
[02:04:30.422 --> 02:04:31.922]  That's right, so stay there.
[02:04:31.922 --> 02:04:33.363]  You've got three contempts of court.
[02:04:33.363 --> 02:04:34.883]  You've already hit two in other frauds.
[02:04:34.883 --> 02:04:37.604]  Hit the final one briefly, and then a summation.
[02:04:37.604 --> 02:04:43.425]  As you just said, your crime is exposing the giant industrial level that have hundreds of trials.
[02:04:44.285 --> 02:04:50.469]  Hundreds of convictions, thousands sent to prison off of what you first exposed 11-12 years ago.
[02:04:50.469 --> 02:04:56.793]  You have exposed, just like all the stuff in our news, the pedophiles.
[02:04:56.793 --> 02:05:00.476]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:05:00.936 --> 02:05:11.321]  So the InfoWars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another.
[02:05:11.321 --> 02:05:16.144]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale, of this public reach.
[02:05:16.144 --> 02:05:30.651]  It is the one model that says, here's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining, self-structured, little-d-democratic structure that because the audience determines what content goes up, the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices in supporting InfoWars.
[02:05:30.771 --> 02:05:48.544]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[02:05:48.544 --> 02:05:55.249]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[02:06:05.737 --> 02:06:06.958]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:06:06.958 --> 02:06:09.099]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:26.187 --> 02:06:30.350]  Harvey Duncombe, one of the top memers, if not the top memer in the world.
[02:06:30.350 --> 02:06:32.471]  Many of his videos get over 50 million views.
[02:06:32.471 --> 02:06:35.533]  He'll be joining us for the last 45 minutes of this hour.
[02:06:35.533 --> 02:06:38.515]  Then Gerald Cilente takes over.
[02:06:38.515 --> 02:06:41.537]  Tommy Robinson hasn't gotten through half of what he wants to hit.
[02:06:41.537 --> 02:06:43.759]  The proof of the fraud, the lies, we already know it.
[02:06:43.759 --> 02:06:44.679]  You've seen the videos.
[02:06:44.679 --> 02:06:45.940]  The guy's a hero.
[02:06:45.940 --> 02:06:48.202]  He's facing prison again.
[02:06:48.202 --> 02:06:49.282]  Three counts.
[02:06:49.282 --> 02:06:53.926]  Just on one count of contempt earlier, he was in three months in solitary confinement.
[02:06:53.926 --> 02:06:55.947]  He appealed and got out on that.
[02:06:56.627 --> 02:07:00.231]  Now, they're talking about throwing him in jail for years.
[02:07:00.231 --> 02:07:03.434]  This is incredible, ladies and gentlemen, so dangerous.
[02:07:03.434 --> 02:07:10.560]  You just heard the Democratic Congresswoman and others saying, arrest conservatives that even criticize herself or AOC.
[02:07:10.560 --> 02:07:14.824]  AOC warned Donald Trump Jr., I've got subpoena power, we'll arrest you.
[02:07:14.824 --> 02:07:17.846]  She doesn't even understand that the legislative doesn't have that power.
[02:07:17.846 --> 02:07:19.828]  These people are dangerous.
[02:07:19.828 --> 02:07:23.031]  Tommy Robinson, in summation, run through the rest of this information.
[02:07:24.306 --> 02:07:28.247]  Those people that are dangerous are in power in Britain.
[02:07:28.247 --> 02:07:30.888]  They're in power everywhere in Britain.
[02:07:30.888 --> 02:07:35.589]  Now, even in the Attorney General's skeleton argument against me, yeah?
[02:07:35.589 --> 02:07:37.710]  This is how laughable this entire case is.
[02:07:37.710 --> 02:07:43.512]  In their own skeleton committal proceedings against me, it referenced the President from 1997, yeah?
[02:07:43.512 --> 02:07:49.794]  It was a case of reporting restrictions against a newspaper published in a PRC where it has decided, and I quote, yeah?
[02:07:52.529 --> 02:08:00.810]  No one should be in peril of suffering a criminal penalty for contempt unless the order which he is said to have infringed is clear.
[02:08:00.810 --> 02:08:02.131]  Okay?
[02:08:02.131 --> 02:08:03.071]  We've got evidence.
[02:08:03.071 --> 02:08:03.831]  It wasn't anywhere.
[02:08:03.831 --> 02:08:05.271]  There was no talk of an order.
[02:08:05.271 --> 02:08:08.792]  The crucial point is that all of this is irrelevant.
[02:08:08.792 --> 02:08:16.973]  The prosecutor just used all of these things in court as distraction tactics because I did not even breach the reporting order on that day.
[02:08:16.973 --> 02:08:19.694]  Even all the rules and regulations, yeah?
[02:08:19.694 --> 02:08:21.514]  The fact that the trial would come to an end
[02:08:22.228 --> 02:08:27.774]  The failure of the court to notify the public of the existence of an order, I thought it weren't in place.
[02:08:27.774 --> 02:08:32.499]  Given how much the government have it in for me, I decided I would still not risk breaching it.
[02:08:33.174 --> 02:08:38.996]  During my training and my studying for Contempt of Court and looking at the Judiciary's own guide.
[02:08:38.996 --> 02:08:42.658]  This is a guide that's issued for judges and the media on reporting restrictions.
[02:08:42.658 --> 02:08:48.060]  It mentioned one critical point and I followed that critical point to the letter.
[02:08:48.060 --> 02:08:54.583]  The crucial bit of evidence, the crucial piece, is that on the Judiciary's own website it states
[02:08:55.325 --> 02:09:04.208]  Courts have no power under section 42 to prevent publication of material that is already in the public domain.
[02:09:04.208 --> 02:09:09.610]  Now this guide that I'm reading was approved by the Lord Chief Justice himself.
[02:09:09.610 --> 02:09:11.071]  Listen, let's be clear.
[02:09:11.071 --> 02:09:20.054]  You went and you read a BBC headline in front of a court that had dozens of reporters out there and then they've arrested you and already put you in prison once for doing that.
[02:09:20.054 --> 02:09:24.756]  Just like Roger Stone's facing jail before his kangaroo trial on Russiagate.
[02:09:25.296 --> 02:09:29.920]  For leaking the news articles on his Instagram feed.
[02:09:29.920 --> 02:09:31.822]  And our own law is the same.
[02:09:31.822 --> 02:09:33.143]  It comes out of British Common Law.
[02:09:33.143 --> 02:09:40.910]  It says if there's a reporting restriction or there's a gag, that doesn't gag you from restating what's already public or reading a record.
[02:09:40.910 --> 02:09:45.714]  It just means you can't yourself as a party say something about what's happening in the proceedings.
[02:09:45.714 --> 02:09:48.297]  So again, this is all total fraud by the court.
[02:09:48.297 --> 02:09:48.597]  Continue.
[02:09:50.026 --> 02:09:51.026]  It's there.
[02:09:51.026 --> 02:09:53.647]  Simply everything I said that day was in the public domain.
[02:09:53.647 --> 02:09:56.528]  Now this is on the judiciary's own website.
[02:09:56.528 --> 02:09:59.568]  It's approved by the Lord Chief Justice.
[02:09:59.568 --> 02:10:02.189]  I referenced this several times in my live stream that day.
[02:10:02.189 --> 02:10:09.351]  I stated clearly that if you watch the hour-long live stream, I was only referencing information already in the public domain.
[02:10:09.351 --> 02:10:13.892]  And they failed to make any clear detail of notifications of any report restriction in this case.
[02:10:13.892 --> 02:10:18.713]  According to legal precedent, that would mean they cannot hold me criminally liable
[02:10:19.406 --> 02:10:25.052]  Crucially, I followed... Sure, and they give men three-month sentences for raping over 50 girls and beating them and torturing them.
[02:10:25.052 --> 02:10:27.435]  We understand your government's super evil right now.
[02:10:27.435 --> 02:10:31.299]  Get to the third charge and then the summation.
[02:10:31.299 --> 02:10:33.441]  Well, unbelievably, Alex, do you know what they said?
[02:10:33.441 --> 02:10:39.067]  When I quoted that everything I said was in the public domain, they said this information on their website was wrong.
[02:10:39.067 --> 02:10:40.349]  They said that's wrong.
[02:10:40.349 --> 02:10:41.330]  And when they say that's wrong,
[02:10:41.914 --> 02:10:51.282]  On the opening page of these... Well, you're reading the law and the rulings and the guidance on the law by the head court, by the Supreme Court, and they're saying that's wrong.
[02:10:51.282 --> 02:10:51.622]  I get it.
[02:10:51.622 --> 02:10:52.904]  It's total judicial arrogance.
[02:10:53.820 --> 02:11:01.044]  And this sounds unbelievable, which is why I'm begging President Trump and your administration, please look at this case.
[02:11:01.044 --> 02:11:02.185]  They said it's wrong.
[02:11:02.185 --> 02:11:04.026]  They said, no, that's not the law, that's wrong.
[02:11:04.026 --> 02:11:05.988]  It's been on their website for five years.
[02:11:05.988 --> 02:11:07.969]  Let me just read this one bit.
[02:11:07.969 --> 02:11:10.430]  This guide is now in its third edition.
[02:11:10.430 --> 02:11:13.732]  This is from the Right Honourable Lord Chief Justice.
[02:11:13.732 --> 02:11:21.157]  I warmly thank Guy Bassel of Matrix Chambers for his work in revising this guidance to ensure its legal accuracy.
[02:11:21.832 --> 02:11:23.253]  It's legal accuracy!
[02:11:23.253 --> 02:11:24.394]  They said it's wrong!
[02:11:24.394 --> 02:11:33.582]  Their case against me was that what I read on their... Let's be clear, the same guy trying to put you in prison said that that is the letter of the law and certified it as the law.
[02:11:34.844 --> 02:11:44.608]  Well, the Lord Chief Justice, this is the previous Lord Chief Justice, but the court, the prosecutor for the Attorney General's government, just said that's wrong, that's not the law.
[02:11:44.608 --> 02:11:52.591]  Now, I knew, when I was defending my case, that it's clear the prosecution was determined to open up a massive legal net no matter what.
[02:11:52.591 --> 02:11:58.993]  It's become apparent the minute the prosecutor for the Attorney General, Andrew Caldicott, that was his name, yeah?
[02:11:58.993 --> 02:12:00.614]  He said he was at court, and let me get it,
[02:12:01.425 --> 02:12:05.190]  So, that's set on their website.
[02:12:05.190 --> 02:12:09.755]  On their website, which they then say is not accurate.
[02:12:09.755 --> 02:12:13.139]  And that is the guidelines for a journalist to go on.
[02:12:13.812 --> 02:12:18.198]  Now last year, Leeds Crown Court broke every single legal procedure possible.
[02:12:18.198 --> 02:12:20.500]  They refused me my own legal representation.
[02:12:20.500 --> 02:12:22.763]  They didn't even tell me what I was accused of doing.
[02:12:22.763 --> 02:12:24.485]  They didn't ask me to plead guilty or not guilty.
[02:12:24.485 --> 02:12:26.428]  They didn't even let me speak.
[02:12:26.428 --> 02:12:31.174]  I was sentenced to 30 months in prison in a 10-minute trial, something you'd imagine being held in North Korea.
[02:12:31.824 --> 02:12:36.645]  It was rightly thrown out on my appeal after I spent three months in solitary confinement.
[02:12:36.645 --> 02:12:42.726]  Judge Marsden decided that day that I needed to be immediately removed from the streets and sent to prison within minutes.
[02:12:42.726 --> 02:12:51.148]  The Muslim child rapist, with 16 witness statements detailing the rape and torture of children, he deemed they were no risk to the British public.
[02:12:51.148 --> 02:12:56.649]  He provided them with bail so they could continue to walk the streets alongside our children.
[02:12:56.649 --> 02:12:57.229]  Okay?
[02:12:57.229 --> 02:12:58.869]  Alongside our children.
[02:12:58.869 --> 02:12:59.029]  Now,
[02:12:59.998 --> 02:13:02.601]  One of these men decided to do a run-up.
[02:13:02.601 --> 02:13:04.823]  He did a run-up a week before the case finished.
[02:13:04.823 --> 02:13:07.265]  He's still hiding in Pakistan.
[02:13:07.265 --> 02:13:12.850]  That dangerous child rapist monster was on the run for months before reporting restrictions were lifted.
[02:13:12.850 --> 02:13:21.538]  So because of these criminal, these reporting restrictions, we had a paedophile rapist on the run and no one could even talk about it.
[02:13:21.538 --> 02:13:23.360]  Our media couldn't warn people.
[02:13:23.360 --> 02:13:25.082]  They couldn't even challenge for his whereabouts.
[02:13:26.649 --> 02:13:31.492]  The government's number one priority first and foremost should be to ensure the safety of the British people.
[02:13:31.492 --> 02:13:35.875]  Exactly what your president, exactly what President Trump is doing for America.
[02:13:35.875 --> 02:13:41.159]  The needs to suppress the scale of these gang rapes across my country trumps everything.
[02:13:41.159 --> 02:13:44.761]  This scumbag rapist is still walking the streets now.
[02:13:44.761 --> 02:13:47.303]  He's evaded justice thanks to Judge Marston.
[02:13:48.413 --> 02:13:52.855]  Do you know in over 60 years, no one has ever been in prison for a publication reporting breach.
[02:13:52.855 --> 02:13:53.655]  No one.
[02:13:53.655 --> 02:13:58.998]  The Judiciary Reporting Restriction Guideline, which is on their website, doesn't even mention prison.
[02:13:58.998 --> 02:14:02.480]  It just mentions a reference of a possibility of unlimited fines.
[02:14:02.480 --> 02:14:09.703]  Can I just show you and your audience and show the public some previous high-profile cases so you can get the context on what's happening to me?
[02:14:10.794 --> 02:14:11.754]  Rod Liddle.
[02:14:11.754 --> 02:14:13.155]  Rod Liddle was a journalist.
[02:14:13.155 --> 02:14:18.757]  He nearly collapsed the Stephen Lawrence murder trial by detailing the defendant's previous criminal record.
[02:14:18.757 --> 02:14:21.077]  He risked collapsing the murder trial.
[02:14:21.077 --> 02:14:22.698]  He wasn't even prosecuted.
[02:14:22.698 --> 02:14:25.499]  The magazine he wrote for got a £3,000 fine.
[02:14:25.499 --> 02:14:31.481]  Journalists at the Daily Mail and the Daily Mirror, they publish this prejudicial information on the Levi Bellifield murder trial.
[02:14:32.193 --> 02:14:35.316]  It was so prejudiced, it collapsed the entire case!
[02:14:35.316 --> 02:14:37.238]  The jury had to be discharged!
[02:14:37.238 --> 02:14:39.199]  Tommy, Tommy, here's what's happening, here's what's happening.
[02:14:39.199 --> 02:14:41.982]  I've got carpe d'antimon, this is incredibly important.
[02:14:41.982 --> 02:14:45.725]  You've still got ten pages of evidence here, ready.
[02:14:45.725 --> 02:14:48.548]  And it's critical that people understand how the police state works.
[02:14:48.548 --> 02:14:56.455]  What you're saying is, even if you did these things, even if it was true, the law is still wrong, but you didn't do what they say, so they're lying, which is really criminal.
[02:14:56.455 --> 02:14:58.197]  And you've got the point that they've never
[02:14:58.897 --> 02:15:09.564]  Given somebody's sentences, 30 months in jail, a year in jail, three months solitary, like they are, and you need to get out of there, and you say London and England has fallen, and I agree, and I think we need to admit it's been fallen.
[02:15:09.564 --> 02:15:13.126]  Kind of like Spain fell to Islam, we can have a La Reconquista.
[02:15:13.126 --> 02:15:20.431]  But we can't have the reconquering of Wales and Scotland and Ireland until we admit all of these problems.
[02:15:20.431 --> 02:15:25.374]  So, why don't you, I know you're very busy, and we're going to get all this together, I want your full statement before we go to the White House.
[02:15:26.283 --> 02:15:34.590]  Why don't you cool your heels for 45 minutes, because Carpe D'Angelo's got huge news as well from inside the White House, and just have dinner or something.
[02:15:34.590 --> 02:15:35.370]  I know it's late.
[02:15:35.370 --> 02:15:37.792]  And then come back for a couple of segments.
[02:15:37.792 --> 02:15:42.116]  Gerald Cilenti, I understand, in 45 minutes and finish up, we'll splice it all together and put it out.
[02:15:42.116 --> 02:15:43.677]  How's that sound?
[02:15:43.677 --> 02:15:45.478]  Yeah, that sounds cool.
[02:15:45.478 --> 02:15:45.939]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:15:45.939 --> 02:15:47.580]  You see, it's my daughter's birthday, man.
[02:15:47.580 --> 02:15:50.462]  Hey, you're kicking ass, and it's a great defense you're putting on.
[02:15:50.462 --> 02:15:53.505]  You want it on record before you go into this rat hole prison.
[02:15:53.505 --> 02:15:54.345]  I understand, brother.
[02:15:54.345 --> 02:15:54.786]  You're awesome.
[02:15:55.582 --> 02:15:56.843]  Maybe not today.

[02:17:49.203 --> 02:17:59.128]  I'll be very, very clear with everybody about all of this.
[02:17:59.128 --> 02:18:10.673]  We're going into the season of war, and they have been inches from shutting down the final bank accounts we have due to their criminal activity and their digital fraud, and we need to know that we've got capital to go six months, a year.
[02:18:10.673 --> 02:18:11.593]  We need to end here.
[02:18:11.593 --> 02:18:13.574]  We need to be provisioned, and you've got my
[02:18:13.814 --> 02:18:17.516]  I have a total commitment that I am going to rampage forward against the enemy fearlessly.
[02:18:17.516 --> 02:18:21.378]  I'm loving every minute of this because I know I'm getting under their skin.
[02:18:21.378 --> 02:18:23.280]  I'm bloodying them up politically.
[02:18:23.280 --> 02:18:28.283]  I'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies and that just brings more people here.
[02:18:28.283 --> 02:18:31.584]  So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you and I need war bonds.
[02:18:31.584 --> 02:18:32.425]  I need gas.
[02:18:32.425 --> 02:18:33.946]  I need ammo politically now.
[02:18:34.346 --> 02:18:41.771]  But literally, if you flood us with money, and if you flood us with product purchases, and if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable, we're unstoppable together.
[02:18:41.771 --> 02:18:43.171]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy.
[02:18:43.171 --> 02:18:50.216]  I want to raise a couple million dollars, right now, to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing, and that you will stand with us, and I will never back down.
[02:18:50.216 --> 02:18:51.196]  You have my commitment.
[02:18:51.196 --> 02:18:55.539]  This only gives me more energy, and more understanding of what we're facing, and that we were right about this.
[02:18:56.980 --> 02:18:58.981]  Robert Barnes, what has Big Tech become?
[02:18:58.981 --> 02:19:01.001]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies.
[02:19:01.001 --> 02:19:07.503]  And the way they did so is because they face no consequence, social, economic, political, or legal, for their illicit activities over two decades.
[02:19:07.503 --> 02:19:18.386]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this, have to bring real social, political, economic consequence
[02:19:18.626 --> 02:19:18.846]  I think?
[02:19:48.846 --> 02:19:50.327]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:09.605 --> 02:20:10.766]  You found it.
[02:20:10.766 --> 02:20:12.787]  The tip of the spear.
[02:20:12.787 --> 02:20:17.051]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:17.051 --> 02:20:17.811]  I hear people.
[02:20:17.811 --> 02:20:19.593]  Senator Warren, I want to start with you.
[02:20:19.593 --> 02:20:26.658]  We are less than 50 miles from Parkland, Florida, where 17 people were killed in a school shooting.
[02:20:26.658 --> 02:20:30.081]  Hey, someone's got my binder.
[02:20:30.081 --> 02:20:31.342]  What's happening?
[02:20:31.342 --> 02:20:33.623]  We are going to take a quick break.
[02:20:33.623 --> 02:20:36.346]  We're going to get this technical situation
[02:20:37.509 --> 02:20:39.778]  What's happening?
[02:21:11.170 --> 02:21:17.192]  And so many other great meme makers, great artists, great communicators, this Thursday are going to be in D.C.
[02:21:17.192 --> 02:21:21.273]  for the summit that's being called a social media summit.
[02:21:21.273 --> 02:21:24.054]  What it really is is a meme summit.
[02:21:24.054 --> 02:21:27.895]  And President Trump is deciding how he's going to take action against big tech.
[02:21:27.895 --> 02:21:28.395]  He met with
[02:21:29.315 --> 02:21:32.477]  The head of Twitter, you know, a few months ago, I happened to just be in D.C.
[02:21:32.477 --> 02:21:33.437]  when it was going on.
[02:21:33.437 --> 02:21:37.860]  Nobody told me to be there, and I just happened to bullhorn while he was inside.
[02:21:37.860 --> 02:21:44.704]  And now the President's come out and said that Jack Dorsey basically lied to him and is engaged in criminal election meddling.
[02:21:44.704 --> 02:21:48.106]  McCarthy Dongtum will show you some photos he sent us.
[02:21:48.106 --> 02:21:53.669]  Well, he got in contact and was able to go meet with the President for 20 minutes, also with his children.
[02:21:54.861 --> 02:21:57.942]  He was nice enough to bring one of his other meme buddies along with him.
[02:21:57.942 --> 02:21:58.702]  Very exciting.
[02:21:58.702 --> 02:22:00.362]  He'll be driving back to D.C.
[02:22:00.362 --> 02:22:04.023]  here in just the next day or so to meet with President Trump again.
[02:22:04.023 --> 02:22:07.504]  A lot of people are calling me saying, what's going to happen at this summit?
[02:22:07.504 --> 02:22:11.365]  I've talked to more than 10 people now that have gotten the invite.
[02:22:11.365 --> 02:22:16.286]  I'm not butthurt that I was not invited because this isn't about journalists or broadcasters.
[02:22:16.286 --> 02:22:18.106]  It's about meme makers.
[02:22:18.106 --> 02:22:24.148]  It's really who's being invited, like Ben Garrison, who's undoubtedly the most prolific and popular
[02:22:24.828 --> 02:22:25.068]  I don't
[02:22:39.804 --> 02:22:43.845]  They got invited, told me, just please don't say we're invited, we don't want to be attacked.
[02:22:43.845 --> 02:22:47.166]  One particularly prominent person that's a frequent guest here.
[02:22:47.166 --> 02:22:50.368]  So don't worry, we've got plenty of representation inside.
[02:22:50.368 --> 02:22:58.350]  But the good news is, Trump has told a lot of people I've talked to, not Carpe Danktum, but others, that he is planning to take action.
[02:22:58.350 --> 02:23:00.871]  He's just trying to get the Justice Department to move with antitrust and more.
[02:23:00.871 --> 02:23:06.233]  So Carpe Danktum joins us during this critical time, because if we take action against big tech censorship,
[02:23:06.893 --> 02:23:11.837]  We can win the next election and set this country back on the right path to success.
[02:23:11.837 --> 02:23:18.563]  So I don't want to get into too much of what we talked about with the President, different angles of this, what you think is coming up this Thursday.
[02:23:18.563 --> 02:23:21.165]  You just start wherever you want, my friend.
[02:23:21.165 --> 02:23:23.147]  Thank you for joining us, Carpe Donctum.
[02:23:23.147 --> 02:23:25.309]  On Twitter, Carpe Donctum.
[02:23:25.309 --> 02:23:26.550]  On YouTube, Carpe Donctum.
[02:23:26.550 --> 02:23:30.453]  And the great part about you being under the President's wing, they've been trying to get you removed.
[02:23:30.453 --> 02:23:32.255]  CNN's been trying to dox you.
[02:23:32.255 --> 02:23:33.416]  They haven't been successful yet.
[02:23:34.537 --> 02:23:40.221]  And we'll just leave it at that, but this is definitely, we laugh about it, this is definitely a war.
[02:23:40.221 --> 02:23:41.663]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:23:41.663 --> 02:23:45.126]  You know, I'll just get this out of the way right away.
[02:23:45.126 --> 02:23:51.511]  I'm wearing a hat that was in the Oval Office and given to me by President Trump, but I'm going to take it off because I look dumb wearing it.
[02:23:51.511 --> 02:23:52.032]  No, you look good.
[02:23:52.032 --> 02:23:56.736]  Leave it on.
[02:23:56.736 --> 02:23:59.158]  So, it's absolutely a war.
[02:24:03.090 --> 02:24:06.053]  They're going to try and silence anyone who's effective.
[02:24:06.053 --> 02:24:12.798]  They're going to try and shut them down, get them off the internet, make sure that the message doesn't go out.
[02:24:12.798 --> 02:24:15.981]  Big Tech is going to continue to ramp up.
[02:24:15.981 --> 02:24:16.721]  We've already seen
[02:24:18.454 --> 02:24:22.415]  Increased bans for highly public figures.
[02:24:22.415 --> 02:24:28.036]  We've seen demonetization for people like Crowder and others.
[02:24:28.036 --> 02:24:39.258]  We're already seeing people like, you know, kind of centrists like Dave Rubin being like shadow banned on YouTube or on Twitter.
[02:24:39.258 --> 02:24:45.479]  They're just going to keep ramping up until they've tightened the noose so much that no information can get out.
[02:24:48.803 --> 02:24:53.927]  And they've even listed mainline liberals that are popular saying they're right-wing leaders too.
[02:24:53.927 --> 02:25:02.393]  It seems like anybody that hasn't taken a deal with YouTube or Google or Facebook or Twitter to be under their control is like Philip DeFranco.
[02:25:02.393 --> 02:25:04.875]  They called him the key right-wing leader.
[02:25:04.875 --> 02:25:08.398]  Philip DeFranco is a liberal that attacks me on a routine basis.
[02:25:08.398 --> 02:25:11.660]  Yeah, it's very funny and you know I think it's
[02:25:13.490 --> 02:25:22.193]  I think you're starting to get a little bit of feedback from some of these liberals that are saying, hey, wait a minute, I'm with you guys.
[02:25:22.193 --> 02:25:38.598]  I said this one thing over here that wasn't quite in line with the party lockstep, but I'm a liberal like you, and they're like, no, you can't talk like that, otherwise you're all right, or you're affiliated with this pro-Trump movement.
[02:25:40.396 --> 02:25:51.990]  You know, the classic liberal is a unicorn, and they're super hard to find because they get squashed every time they say anything rational.
[02:25:51.990 --> 02:25:58.998]  There's no longer room in the platform, or the democratic platform, for rational thought.
[02:25:59.218 --> 02:26:00.759]  And by the way, we're not just saying that.
[02:26:00.759 --> 02:26:02.679]  I mean, I've become punch drunk.
[02:26:02.679 --> 02:26:11.422]  They're actually winning in some respects, where I see articles every day out of Germany, Sweden, Austria, even Italy's got a better leader, but still the courts are corrupt.
[02:26:11.422 --> 02:26:15.043]  Where like someone criticizes, there's 500 migrants in our town of 100.
[02:26:15.043 --> 02:26:16.584]  They raped my daughter today.
[02:26:16.584 --> 02:26:18.184]  Boom, you're arrested.
[02:26:18.184 --> 02:26:23.706]  Or, I mean, there is such a, Tommy Robinson is facing years in prison.
[02:26:24.906 --> 02:26:29.808]  For simply standing outside a courthouse when convicted pedophiles walk by and say, what do you think of your conviction?
[02:26:29.808 --> 02:26:31.809]  Which is totally, I mean, totally legal.
[02:26:31.809 --> 02:26:33.009]  This is a war.
[02:26:33.009 --> 02:26:38.171]  We have Democrats from AOC to all these other idiots saying, arrest people that criticize them.
[02:26:38.171 --> 02:26:40.032]  I mean, these are real authoritarians.
[02:26:40.032 --> 02:26:40.892]  This is really happening.
[02:26:41.591 --> 02:26:43.652]  Right, that was just a couple days ago.
[02:26:43.652 --> 02:26:50.116]  I forget who it was that they were saying that we should shut down anybody that makes fun of us on the internet.
[02:26:50.116 --> 02:26:53.718]  Wasn't that a representative or a senator that said that?
[02:26:53.718 --> 02:26:56.640]  Yeah, it's Congresswoman Wilson from Florida.
[02:26:56.640 --> 02:26:59.321]  Right, and that's insane.
[02:26:59.321 --> 02:27:08.867]  The state of big tech and the state of the Democratic Party is moving just further and further out.
[02:27:08.867 --> 02:27:10.528]  She's a crazed Muppet!
[02:27:11.601 --> 02:27:15.002]  And then every time she gets criticized, she goes, I'm a lesbian, don't criticize me.
[02:27:15.002 --> 02:27:18.243]  Lady, I don't give a flying what you're doing.
[02:27:18.243 --> 02:27:21.683]  The point is, keep your damn hands off my freedom, you witch!
[02:27:21.683 --> 02:27:23.264]  You're a damn witch clown!
[02:27:23.264 --> 02:27:24.244]  Go to hell!
[02:27:24.244 --> 02:27:25.044]  I got my rights!
[02:27:25.044 --> 02:27:27.125]  A lot of people died for that, lady!
[02:27:27.125 --> 02:27:28.445]  Millions!
[02:27:28.445 --> 02:27:31.666]  I mean, all my camera crew is so freaked out about the Tommy Robinson thing.
[02:27:31.666 --> 02:27:32.626]  You can all watch the video.
[02:27:32.626 --> 02:27:34.766]  He's outside politely asking people.
[02:27:34.766 --> 02:27:37.347]  The press is allowed to do that in the UK, so they are here.
[02:27:37.347 --> 02:27:39.207]  And then they're putting him in prison!
[02:27:39.207 --> 02:27:41.208]  I mean, we're all in danger, brother.
[02:27:42.893 --> 02:27:45.735]  I thought, so that happened what, like nine months ago?
[02:27:45.735 --> 02:27:46.835]  Yeah.
[02:27:46.835 --> 02:27:54.839]  I thought that was insane, just on the surface of it, that he got put in jail for filming outside of the borders.
[02:27:54.839 --> 02:27:55.560]  30 months!
[02:27:55.560 --> 02:28:00.562]  He spent three months in solitary, congressmen made a big deal, they let him out on appeal.
[02:28:00.562 --> 02:28:04.024]  He was convicted by a judge in five minutes, no trial.
[02:28:04.810 --> 02:28:14.174]  Do you also remember, I believe he got arrested at Speaker's Corner, where you're supposed to be able to say whatever you want, and he got arrested over there.
[02:28:14.174 --> 02:28:15.274]  They wouldn't let him speak.
[02:28:15.274 --> 02:28:17.975]  God, look what he looked like when he came out of the jail.
[02:28:17.975 --> 02:28:23.397]  Almost 40 pounds lighter.
[02:28:23.397 --> 02:28:30.900]  What is happening in Europe, and what is happening, well, this isn't Europe, but Germany, places like that, is...
[02:28:33.277 --> 02:28:34.878]  What they want to have happen here.
[02:28:55.180 --> 02:28:59.741]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[02:28:59.741 --> 02:29:01.822]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[02:29:01.822 --> 02:29:03.563]  I had a problem like you once.
[02:29:03.563 --> 02:29:10.105]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[02:29:10.105 --> 02:29:15.186]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[02:29:15.186 --> 02:29:19.888]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[02:29:20.328 --> 02:29:23.450]  You need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[02:29:23.450 --> 02:29:30.454]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits and totally change your life.
[02:29:30.454 --> 02:29:35.636]  And if you have PPO private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[02:29:35.636 --> 02:29:38.938]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse.
[02:29:38.938 --> 02:29:39.879]  Get clean.

[02:29:45.742 --> 02:29:46.222]  800-506-6740 That's 800-506-6740
[02:29:57.139 --> 02:30:13.807]  I talk about this on the air, and I know it sinks in to people, but I've decided that we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements, in that if you go back five, six years ago, before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it, I would talk about how great the products are, and how they were the best, and why they were, and I'd have doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good.
[02:30:13.807 --> 02:30:21.230]  And instead, the last few years, I'm like, hey, you need to really support us, or they'll shut us down, and the biggest thing people like to buy is supplements, because they know how great they are and how wonderful they were.
[02:30:21.590 --> 02:30:23.331]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[02:30:23.331 --> 02:30:27.574]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements.
[02:30:27.574 --> 02:30:35.520]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[02:30:35.520 --> 02:30:38.222]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them.
[02:30:38.222 --> 02:30:43.145]  And all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things.
[02:30:43.145 --> 02:30:44.326]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[02:30:44.326 --> 02:30:45.147]  They have side effects.
[02:30:45.307 --> 02:30:49.889]  Not with Mother Nature, but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest.

[02:32:20.430 --> 02:32:25.296]  The future belongs to the brave, the strong, the proud, and the free.

[02:32:32.585 --> 02:32:37.951]  We all share the same heroes, the same home, the same heart.

[02:32:45.095 --> 02:32:46.235]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:32:46.235 --> 02:32:48.997]  Full power of the Republic in the name of Jesus Christ!
[02:32:48.997 --> 02:32:50.697]  Full power!
[02:32:50.697 --> 02:32:51.778]  Damn the torpedoes!
[02:32:51.778 --> 02:32:59.261]  Go straight at them!
[02:32:59.261 --> 02:33:01.942]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:11.693 --> 02:33:16.656]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:45.003 --> 02:33:47.344]  Harpey Dunctum is our guest.
[02:33:47.344 --> 02:33:50.905]  Currently the dominant meme maker on the planet.
[02:33:50.905 --> 02:33:56.446]  He works to not have his name put out because they're ever seeking where he lives to attack his wife and children.
[02:33:56.446 --> 02:33:57.426]  That's how they operate.
[02:33:57.426 --> 02:33:59.847]  Believe me, I've experienced it.
[02:33:59.847 --> 02:34:02.948]  Once they have their way, prisoners will be faced.
[02:34:02.948 --> 02:34:06.229]  We're not victims, we're targets because we're exposing the globalists.
[02:34:07.159 --> 02:34:09.200]  We're exposing their endgame plan.
[02:34:09.200 --> 02:34:10.180]  But we're fighting back.
[02:34:10.180 --> 02:34:14.002]  And in Trump, they see everything they hate.
[02:34:14.002 --> 02:34:16.603]  Carpe, you've got the floor here in this segment, because I always run over folks.
[02:34:16.603 --> 02:34:19.784]  I heard you on that one the other day, and he's just as bad as I am about interrupting.
[02:34:19.784 --> 02:34:21.045]  I love him to death.
[02:34:21.045 --> 02:34:21.865]  But you're a smart guy.
[02:34:21.865 --> 02:34:25.527]  So I've got a lot of questions, like talking to Trump for 20 minutes.
[02:34:25.527 --> 02:34:27.387]  What's the inside baseball?
[02:34:27.387 --> 02:34:31.529]  Your take on what's coming up at this big summit in just three days in D.C.
[02:34:31.529 --> 02:34:32.249]  that you're going to be at.
[02:34:32.249 --> 02:34:33.890]  You're pre-invited.
[02:34:33.890 --> 02:34:35.371]  Nobody else I know is pre-invited.
[02:34:36.811 --> 02:34:42.795]  Trump has a special liking for you, so do I. What do you want to impart to this large audience?
[02:34:42.795 --> 02:34:56.504]  Well, you know, so I almost feel bad, you know, talking about, you know, it was a big moment to go in there and meet Trump, but I almost feel bad making such a big deal about it.
[02:34:56.504 --> 02:35:00.566]  I know it is a big deal, but when there's so many other things going on,
[02:35:02.182 --> 02:35:06.074]  But he's recognizing that you've gotten billions of views and your art is powerful.
[02:35:09.523 --> 02:35:10.744]  I totally get that.
[02:35:10.744 --> 02:35:20.186]  I just feel like there's so much going on right now that it's hard for me to stop and kind of take it all in.
[02:35:20.186 --> 02:35:24.626]  But in the White House, it was an amazing experience.
[02:35:24.626 --> 02:35:28.947]  I think that you asked about what the summit is going to be like.
[02:35:28.947 --> 02:35:32.328]  I don't know specifically, but I know it's in the East Wing.
[02:35:32.328 --> 02:35:35.309]  I think there's going to be a lot of people there.
[02:35:38.097 --> 02:36:03.330]  I feel like it's going to be just a venue where different influencers that have experienced censorship or are able to still speak out about censorship can get together, network together, and hopefully build relationships that can then be leveraged to kind of bring big tech back to heel.
[02:36:05.545 --> 02:36:32.281]  And I really hope that during the meeting that President Trump will speak out strongly against those that have been censored like you and remove from the public discussion and issue some sort of ultimatum of that this needs to stop or we're going to have to go down some real serious avenues here of how to fix it.
[02:36:34.102 --> 02:36:36.645]  I hope that that's the statement that he makes.
[02:36:36.645 --> 02:36:50.843]  Whether or not that's the statement that will be at this meeting, I feel like this is going to be one of many future meetings, some maybe even more exclusive and possibly board
[02:36:51.203 --> 02:36:52.323]  I'll tell you what I'm thinking.
[02:37:15.563 --> 02:37:24.727]  Trump needs people like you on his staff to help produce memes for him directly that are from the president so they don't dare touch them and they have that imperial glow to them that we need.
[02:37:24.727 --> 02:37:26.047]  You're a smart cookie.
[02:37:26.047 --> 02:37:32.530]  There's a lot of inside baseball we can't get into, but I agree with your analysis and the fact that the president said obviously he wants to meet with you some more.
[02:37:32.530 --> 02:37:40.112]  What that means is that Trump is preparing to kind of look at the army and figure out and talk to you guys about what should be done.
[02:37:40.112 --> 02:37:41.273]  There'll be breakaway meetings.
[02:37:42.174 --> 02:37:48.099]  I've said this before, but there's a certain quality about the stuff that I do that could never be done in an official capacity.
[02:38:04.677 --> 02:38:15.386]  I can create things that can be shared around, and maybe the President doesn't share it, but there are things that if I was working for the White House or... No, no, I mean it'd be too much.
[02:38:15.386 --> 02:38:18.448]  I mean, probably in an unofficial capacity, but yeah.
[02:38:18.448 --> 02:38:22.191]  Yeah, there'd be a hundred lawyers standing between me and the retweet button.
[02:38:24.517 --> 02:38:29.161]  So there is some good to not actually having official people inside the campaign.
[02:38:29.161 --> 02:38:32.683]  No, I'm just saying, talking to you and interviewing you before, you're a smart cookie.
[02:38:32.683 --> 02:38:36.807]  And this is the type of people Trump needs, is real people that didn't come out of the swamp, but came out of America.
[02:38:36.807 --> 02:38:37.988]  Right.
[02:38:37.988 --> 02:38:40.950]  Well, and I totally agree with that.
[02:38:40.950 --> 02:38:44.533]  I think he does have people around him.
[02:38:44.533 --> 02:38:51.018]  And I want to say that the media team is doing a fantastic job for Trump.
[02:38:51.018 --> 02:38:53.500]  Some of the videos that they've come out with in the last
[02:38:54.150 --> 02:38:57.112]  You know, six months have been just spot on.
[02:38:57.112 --> 02:39:00.274]  Great music, great visuals.
[02:39:00.274 --> 02:39:05.336]  The 4th of July video for the speech was very well done.
[02:39:05.336 --> 02:39:07.378]  And that's the kind of stuff that they need to continue.
[02:39:07.378 --> 02:39:09.819]  Now, they don't do the memes so much.
[02:39:09.819 --> 02:39:15.462]  They don't add really the funny elements to it, but their serious work is really getting good.
[02:39:15.462 --> 02:39:17.003]  You're absolutely right.
[02:39:17.003 --> 02:39:18.224]  Dan Scavino's doing a great job.
[02:39:18.789 --> 02:39:19.930]  No, they certainly are.
[02:39:19.930 --> 02:39:23.332]  And that's why the system's getting mad, because Trump's almost three years in.
[02:39:23.332 --> 02:39:24.972]  He's finally getting some good people in.
[02:39:24.972 --> 02:39:26.413]  He's getting his sea legs.
[02:39:26.413 --> 02:39:27.474]  That's scaring the system.
[02:39:27.474 --> 02:39:30.015]  That's why they spin everything as if it's a disaster.
[02:39:30.015 --> 02:39:33.817]  They're like, oh, Trump 15 minutes called the attack off.
[02:39:33.817 --> 02:39:35.999]  The British ambassador says it's inept.
[02:39:35.999 --> 02:39:37.239]  No one's ever done that.
[02:39:37.239 --> 02:39:41.201]  During the Cuban Missile Crisis, Kennedy was hovering over the launch buttons.
[02:39:41.201 --> 02:39:47.405]  They'd already given the order to shoot the rudder off the Russian ship, but the Russians turned at the last minute.
[02:39:48.602 --> 02:39:50.643]  And they called back and Kennedy killed the attack.
[02:39:50.643 --> 02:39:53.844]  They're shipping, you know, the nuclear missiles to Cuba.
[02:39:53.844 --> 02:39:59.107]  That happens constantly with a strike that is political.
[02:39:59.107 --> 02:40:01.908]  All the time, most of the time, presidents call stuff off.
[02:40:01.908 --> 02:40:03.069]  Here's an example, Cuban Missile Crisis.
[02:40:03.069 --> 02:40:06.530]  I don't want to go into a long story, but they've got an NPR piece about it, which I'd already read before.
[02:40:06.530 --> 02:40:07.291]  I wouldn't just believe NPR.
[02:40:08.632 --> 02:40:14.359]  They were inserting green berets, which really just means you're willing to do suicide missions, with cyanide pills.
[02:40:14.359 --> 02:40:16.982]  During the Cuban Missile Crisis, he'd be brought in by helicopter.
[02:40:16.982 --> 02:40:18.584]  They'd have to hike in 30, 40 miles.
[02:40:18.584 --> 02:40:19.685]  They'd get to the missile site.
[02:40:19.685 --> 02:40:25.051]  They'd sit on top of a water tower or whatever with a rifle that projected just a beam of light.
[02:40:25.051 --> 02:40:27.093]  It wasn't lazing, like infrared back then.
[02:40:27.754 --> 02:40:27.974]  Right.
[02:40:27.974 --> 02:40:28.394]  Right.
[02:40:58.475 --> 02:40:59.295]  Right.
[02:40:59.295 --> 02:41:07.620]  Well, so I've talked to a few reporters since I got out of the White House there, and I've told them the story.
[02:41:07.620 --> 02:41:17.647]  One of the few stories that I will share from the White House, which is Trump turned to my kids and he said, he pointed to the little red button on his desk and he said, you know what that button does?
[02:41:18.533 --> 02:41:20.313]  And they said no.
[02:41:20.313 --> 02:41:23.854]  And he says, well, maybe we should press it and see what happens.
[02:41:23.854 --> 02:41:26.095]  Some people say that it launches the missiles.
[02:41:26.095 --> 02:41:27.955]  And so he goes over and presses it.
[02:41:27.955 --> 02:41:30.856]  And the kids are all excited about what's going to happen.
[02:41:30.856 --> 02:41:34.777]  And then just one of the Secret Service says, I'm right here, Mr. President.
[02:41:34.777 --> 02:41:36.417]  And so, I mean, that's a funny story.
[02:41:36.417 --> 02:41:43.199]  But, you know, I can imagine that when anybody in the media that I've told that to gets that story,
[02:41:43.877 --> 02:41:49.060]  They're going to run with the headline of Trump plays with his Secret Service button on his desk.
[02:41:49.060 --> 02:41:52.522]  Or they'd say Trump scares children with launching a nuclear war.
[02:41:52.522 --> 02:41:53.823]  Right, right, exactly.
[02:41:53.823 --> 02:41:57.765]  Trump jokes about nuclear war in the Oval Office.
[02:41:57.765 --> 02:42:02.308]  Those are the types of things that are just insane to think about.
[02:42:02.308 --> 02:42:03.509]  I mean, the sign behind me?
[02:42:04.301 --> 02:42:05.982]  Uh, the Trump forever sign?
[02:42:05.982 --> 02:42:09.585]  They're already spitting your memes that, oh, they wanted to be a dictator!
[02:42:09.585 --> 02:42:11.506]  Right, like he's gonna be president forever.
[02:42:11.506 --> 02:42:15.128]  Like, I had- He's 73!
[02:42:15.128 --> 02:42:19.391]  I had a reporter asking me, so do you think he's really gonna be president forever?
[02:42:19.391 --> 02:42:21.092]  And I was like, are you insane?
[02:42:21.092 --> 02:42:22.293]  Like, what is wrong with you?
[02:42:22.293 --> 02:42:24.014]  On average, he'll be dead in two years!
[02:42:25.287 --> 02:42:27.589]  I mean, come on.
[02:42:27.589 --> 02:42:31.351]  The left has completely lost any sort of humor.
[02:42:31.351 --> 02:42:33.813]  They've lost any sort of rational thought.
[02:42:33.813 --> 02:42:34.813]  It's just insane.
[02:42:34.813 --> 02:42:35.974]  Well, what they are is deceivers.
[02:42:35.974 --> 02:42:37.235]  Carpe, you're on fire.
[02:42:37.235 --> 02:42:39.496]  I want to hear more about this, because this will be big national news.
[02:42:39.496 --> 02:42:42.338]  Trump plays with a red button on his jacket.
[02:42:42.338 --> 02:42:42.579]  Right.
[02:42:42.579 --> 02:42:44.880]  Make you read 20 paragraphs until you find out.
[02:42:44.880 --> 02:42:46.601]  Carpe Duncan is our guest.
[02:42:46.601 --> 02:42:47.742]  Amazing individual.
[02:42:47.742 --> 02:42:48.943]  Aren't you blessed to have him?
[02:42:55.043 --> 02:42:59.226]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[02:42:59.226 --> 02:43:00.306]  They are technocrats.
[02:43:00.306 --> 02:43:02.608]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[02:43:02.608 --> 02:43:09.952]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[02:43:09.952 --> 02:43:11.813]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[02:43:11.813 --> 02:43:13.915]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[02:43:14.415 --> 02:43:20.779]  One of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[02:43:20.779 --> 02:43:25.962]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4WheelsLife.com, I couldn't do it.
[02:43:25.962 --> 02:43:34.987]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality, and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.

[02:45:04.078 --> 02:45:10.303]  Together, we are part of one of the greatest stories ever told, the story of America.
[02:45:10.303 --> 02:45:18.929]  It is the epic tale of a great nation whose people have risked everything for what they know is right and what they know is true.
[02:45:20.090 --> 02:45:35.367]  As long as we stay true to our cause, as long as we remember our great history, as long as we never ever stop fighting for a better future, then there will be nothing that America can not do.
[02:45:46.317 --> 02:45:47.438]  Infowars.com.
[02:45:47.438 --> 02:45:49.000]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:51.583]  Full power of the Republic in the name of Jesus Christ.
[02:45:51.583 --> 02:45:53.044]  Full power!
[02:45:53.044 --> 02:45:54.146]  Damn the torpedoes!
[02:45:54.146 --> 02:45:55.027]  Go straight at them!
[02:45:57.811 --> 02:46:02.432]  It's never been easy to figure out the essentials of a new supplement routine.

[02:46:58.733 --> 02:47:01.331]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:22.820 --> 02:47:26.183]  I love the smell of liberal tears.
[02:47:26.183 --> 02:47:31.046]  Smells like victory.
[02:47:31.046 --> 02:47:33.368]  InfoWars smells like victory, doesn't it?
[02:47:33.368 --> 02:47:37.491]  Yeah, it smells like victory.
[02:47:37.491 --> 02:47:39.713]  It smells like Americana.
[02:47:39.713 --> 02:47:42.735]  That sweet smell.
[02:47:42.735 --> 02:47:48.319]  And the fallen ones hate it, but we have the light and the power.
[02:47:48.319 --> 02:47:50.521]  They seek it, but you'll never have it.
[02:47:52.242 --> 02:47:55.624]  Humanity has been in the Odin sleep.
[02:47:55.624 --> 02:47:59.687]  Now it's time to stop sleeping and awaken.
[02:47:59.687 --> 02:48:01.168]  Come out of the trance.
[02:48:01.168 --> 02:48:04.009]  Carpe dondum, you made some amazing points so far.
[02:48:04.009 --> 02:48:15.276]  Tommy Robbins is going to come back because he didn't finish his statement before he goes into a black hole prison, where I'm not exaggerating, they let the Muslims come to his food opening and poop in it and the police laugh.
[02:48:15.276 --> 02:48:19.599]  That's how when leftists are running the government, what you live under, he's about to literally enter a
[02:48:20.512 --> 02:48:22.014]  You know what, Hole?
[02:48:22.014 --> 02:48:22.736]  We're praying for him.
[02:48:22.736 --> 02:48:25.380]  He's popping back on to finish what he said to Gerald Cilente.
[02:48:25.380 --> 02:48:30.828]  But just keep rolling with where you see the country going, where you see the world going.
[02:48:30.828 --> 02:48:33.893]  All these other great meme folks you're in contact with on the McDonald's subreddit.
[02:48:34.696 --> 02:48:44.702]  Oh, that really woke Trump up from somebody else that talked to the president, that he was really pissed that they froze the Donald during the Democrat debates as if, oh, let's protect our precious debates.
[02:48:44.702 --> 02:48:45.923]  This will defeat Trump.
[02:48:45.923 --> 02:48:49.465]  You have horrible candidates.
[02:48:49.465 --> 02:48:53.287]  Cory Booker always looks like he's giving birth to a 400 pound turd.
[02:48:53.287 --> 02:48:57.309]  He thinks that's like an earnest look.
[02:48:57.309 --> 02:48:58.530]  I mean, these are clowns.
[02:48:58.530 --> 02:48:59.450]  These are clowns.
[02:48:59.450 --> 02:49:00.411]  We need to awaken.
[02:49:01.691 --> 02:49:04.772]  Alex, you're talking bad about Spartacus, man.
[02:49:04.772 --> 02:49:07.833]  You can't talk bad about Spartacus.
[02:49:07.833 --> 02:49:08.653]  I'm Spartacus!
[02:49:08.653 --> 02:49:13.195]  I'm releasing secret info, which wasn't secret info!
[02:49:13.195 --> 02:49:22.497]  Well, you mentioned the Donald, and wasn't that nuts that on the day of the debates they shut down the Donald?
[02:49:22.497 --> 02:49:26.699]  The place where all of the memes will be coming out?
[02:49:28.183 --> 02:49:32.226]  For the debates, they shut it down that morning.
[02:49:32.226 --> 02:49:33.887]  As far as I know, it's still shut down.
[02:49:33.887 --> 02:49:37.109]  I mean, you can get to it, but you have to know the exact URL.
[02:49:37.109 --> 02:49:39.531]  You can't search for it.
[02:49:39.531 --> 02:49:41.953]  It won't show up in your subscriptions.
[02:49:41.953 --> 02:49:47.277]  But, I mean, they've been messing with the Donald for a year and a half.
[02:49:47.277 --> 02:49:51.380]  And that's after Senator Wyden, who looks like a dead
[02:49:52.981 --> 02:49:58.522]  Lizard, and of course Senator Murphy says I must be taken off the air to save democracy.
[02:49:58.522 --> 02:49:58.902]  Right.
[02:49:58.902 --> 02:50:07.604]  He says he wants it banned in a public ask me anything and now they phantom zoned it which is the next thing they do before they ban it.
[02:50:07.604 --> 02:50:08.905]  Again, that's incredible.
[02:50:08.905 --> 02:50:11.305]  That's a message board about the President.
[02:50:11.305 --> 02:50:12.645]  Trump must act on this.
[02:50:12.645 --> 02:50:14.186]  Sorry, I'm ranting.
[02:50:14.186 --> 02:50:14.866]  You're fine.
[02:50:16.246 --> 02:50:23.228]  You know, there have been, and I want to give a shout out to the moderators of The Donald.
[02:50:23.228 --> 02:50:33.050]  They do a fantastic job because there's infiltrators all the time trying to post bad content on there that'll get us in trouble and they're removing stuff all the time.
[02:50:33.050 --> 02:50:34.111]  Sure, the left admits they do.
[02:50:34.111 --> 02:50:37.232]  They go on there and say the most racist crap attributed to us.
[02:50:37.232 --> 02:50:39.212]  It's like Jussie Smollett stuff.
[02:50:39.212 --> 02:50:39.912]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:50:39.912 --> 02:50:41.893]  They're hoaxing on us all the time.
[02:50:43.573 --> 02:50:45.535]  You can look at the logs.
[02:50:45.535 --> 02:50:57.285]  Reddit itself has only had to remove, I think, two or three posts in the last month out of, you know, the quote unquote, like 700,000, 800,000 people on there.
[02:50:57.285 --> 02:50:58.566]  It's more like six million.
[02:50:58.566 --> 02:51:05.611]  But out of all the things that are posted on there, Reddit has only had to step in like twice.
[02:51:05.611 --> 02:51:09.795]  And who knows what those things were anyway, if they were even something they should have stepped in
[02:51:10.271 --> 02:51:12.012]  But exactly, but let's explain.
[02:51:12.012 --> 02:51:14.093]  Phantom Zone.
[02:51:14.093 --> 02:51:15.974]  So how do we find the Donald's subreddit?
[02:51:15.974 --> 02:51:16.894]  Well, we should have the URL.
[02:51:16.894 --> 02:51:18.455]  You have to type it in by hand.
[02:51:18.455 --> 02:51:20.416]  Unsearchable.
[02:51:20.416 --> 02:51:21.476]  Again, Phantom Zoning.
[02:51:21.476 --> 02:51:22.777]  How do we find that?
[02:51:22.777 --> 02:51:31.881]  Well, you have to go to www.reddit.com slash r slash TheDonald.
[02:51:31.881 --> 02:51:33.442]  Again, unsearchable.
[02:51:33.442 --> 02:51:35.403]  They've all worked in coordination.
[02:51:35.403 --> 02:51:36.483]  You've got to actually go.
[02:51:36.483 --> 02:51:38.244]  I mean, this is just, it's incredible.
[02:51:39.755 --> 02:51:42.877]  Well, there's an underscore.
[02:51:42.877 --> 02:51:44.538]  Yeah, I think you guys pulled the wrong thing up.
[02:51:44.538 --> 02:51:45.839]  Yeah, it's an underscore.
[02:51:45.839 --> 02:51:49.222]  So it's this incredible taxing thing.
[02:51:49.222 --> 02:51:49.942]  Yeah.
[02:51:49.942 --> 02:51:51.663]  But here's what's funny, Carpe D'Antem.
[02:51:51.663 --> 02:51:54.946]  They thought, oh, our magic debates will be so good.
[02:51:54.946 --> 02:52:00.810]  We can't let Donald and them, where the memes come from, we can't let them make fun of it.
[02:52:00.810 --> 02:52:04.753]  It was still a giant train wreck, even because it's pathetic.
[02:52:04.753 --> 02:52:06.594]  You can't polish a turd.
[02:52:07.608 --> 02:52:09.550]  Yes, there you go.
[02:52:09.550 --> 02:52:13.755]  There's the quarantine that they put on the Donald.
[02:52:13.755 --> 02:52:21.523]  Making sure you know that there might be something that might upset you on the other side of that link.
[02:52:21.523 --> 02:52:22.925]  But yeah, you're right.
[02:52:22.925 --> 02:52:23.746]  It didn't matter because
[02:52:24.733 --> 02:52:36.817]  There was the debacle with all the technical issues and then the next night you had that crazy lady talking about crystals and power of love and all that kind of stuff.
[02:52:36.817 --> 02:52:45.000]  And all the illegals and everything free and the other guy Castro saying we need to have trans people be able to have abortions.
[02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:47.261]  Trans men.
[02:52:47.261 --> 02:52:48.662]  That was one of my best tweets of the night.
[02:52:50.023 --> 02:52:52.864]  Was being like, wait, what?
[02:52:52.864 --> 02:52:55.264]  Trans women deserve the right to abortion?
[02:52:55.264 --> 02:52:56.325]  How does that work, exactly?
[02:52:56.325 --> 02:53:03.246]  And Biden doing his little... That thing was hilarious.
[02:53:03.246 --> 02:53:05.567]  It was a train wreck from beginning to end.
[02:53:05.567 --> 02:53:09.648]  Swalwell being out there on the stage.
[02:53:09.648 --> 02:53:14.329]  Oh, Swallow's well is just... He's announcing today.
[02:53:14.329 --> 02:53:16.909]  I think he's leaving the race today.
[02:53:16.909 --> 02:53:18.110]  He's doing a press conference later.
[02:53:20.234 --> 02:53:22.676]  I'll be sad to see him go, though.
[02:53:22.676 --> 02:53:25.338]  Well, it's an incredible time to be alive.
[02:53:25.338 --> 02:53:30.162]  And just because they're still being devastated, it's, ugh, look at him.
[02:53:30.162 --> 02:53:41.591]  It's very dangerous to now say, oh, one of the biggest message boards in the world with six million users, the Donald subreddit, you can't get to it, it's quarantined, it's bad.
[02:53:41.591 --> 02:53:47.736]  They're saying a message board, you can't, I mean, Trump has to act on this.
[02:53:47.736 --> 02:53:48.297]  Well, you know,
[02:53:49.777 --> 02:53:53.720]  They quarantined it because they can't ban it.
[02:53:53.720 --> 02:54:00.424]  If they ban it, it will create, they know it will have the Streisand effect, that if they ban it, it will just, it will go crazy.
[02:54:00.424 --> 02:54:04.486]  As you understand, sending something into the Phantom Zone is the same thing.
[02:54:04.486 --> 02:54:09.029]  Well, we have it executed and he's in the Tower of London.
[02:54:09.029 --> 02:54:12.211]  It's that in-between zone.
[02:54:12.211 --> 02:54:15.073]  It's not quite the same as banning, but you know, it's,
[02:54:16.371 --> 02:54:18.012]  It's for the lawyers, basically.
[02:54:18.012 --> 02:54:19.292]  And it's for the PR people.
[02:54:19.292 --> 02:54:21.533]  They can be like, no, we're allowing them to be there.
[02:54:21.533 --> 02:54:22.433]  They're fine.
[02:54:22.433 --> 02:54:23.853]  They're just... Well, no, no.
[02:54:23.853 --> 02:54:29.475]  It's what Matt Drudge said almost four years ago in this, in that room through the door over there.
[02:54:29.475 --> 02:54:34.196]  He said, Alex, first they put you in a digital ghetto.
[02:54:34.196 --> 02:54:34.617]  Right.
[02:54:34.617 --> 02:54:37.357]  Then make everybody forget about you, make you poor for a couple of years.
[02:54:37.357 --> 02:54:38.778]  Then they ship your ass to the death camp.
[02:54:39.485 --> 02:54:44.869]  I mean, we're at the death camp at Infowars, but people are fighting through, you know, whatever.
[02:54:44.869 --> 02:54:49.593]  But as for the Donald, doesn't it get, it's been put into the digital ghetto.
[02:54:49.593 --> 02:54:50.054]  Absolutely.
[02:54:53.129 --> 02:54:55.290]  You watch Black Mirror?
[02:54:55.290 --> 02:55:06.994]  There's a lot of kind of social justice warrior stuff in there, but there was an episode where they had these little implants in their eyes and you could block people and they would just fuzz them out so you couldn't see them anymore.
[02:55:06.994 --> 02:55:10.016]  That's what they're doing with different people on social media.
[02:55:10.016 --> 02:55:11.436]  They're still there.
[02:55:11.436 --> 02:55:13.277]  You just can't see them or interact with them.
[02:55:13.277 --> 02:55:16.898]  Everything's all garbled.
[02:55:16.898 --> 02:55:19.959]  Guys, try to pull up the Caitlin Bennett article from last week.
[02:55:19.959 --> 02:55:20.600]  The headline was
[02:55:23.504 --> 02:55:27.387]  Instagram bans American flag because of InfoWars image.
[02:55:27.387 --> 02:55:33.111]  And it was her like eight, nine months ago in an InfoWars shirt with an American flag.
[02:55:33.111 --> 02:55:34.331]  Yeah, I heard about that.
[02:55:34.331 --> 02:55:35.092]  That's insane.
[02:55:35.092 --> 02:55:37.654]  And they blurted out and said, you do this again, you're banned.
[02:55:37.654 --> 02:55:40.976]  And that was, they said two months ago, no Alex Jones.
[02:55:40.976 --> 02:55:42.717]  But they're going back in time now.
[02:55:42.717 --> 02:55:43.938]  They're like, oh, you know, you did this.
[02:55:45.140 --> 02:55:57.924]  Well, I guess I'm lucky then, because I haven't been banned from... I've posted your stuff on Instagram and on Facebook, and I've so far gotten away with it, but I guess look for that in the future.
[02:55:57.924 --> 02:56:01.665]  Well, Carpe D'Antem, they know the President's tweeted out a bunch of your stuff.
[02:56:01.665 --> 02:56:02.766]  They know the President likes you.
[02:56:02.766 --> 02:56:05.226]  They're scared of triggering him.
[02:56:05.226 --> 02:56:11.188]  And so that's what I'm trying to explain to you, the fact that you're having phone calls, 20-minute one-on-one conversations.
[02:56:11.188 --> 02:56:12.969]  By the way, you're great for... I'm not kissing your ass, but...
[02:56:13.837 --> 02:56:17.618]  Like the photos from the White House are like world class.
[02:56:17.618 --> 02:56:19.278]  Time Magazine's not that good.
[02:56:19.278 --> 02:56:23.999]  Like the kid playing with the airplane and Trump in the background.
[02:56:23.999 --> 02:56:25.919]  These are great photos.
[02:56:25.919 --> 02:56:30.040]  Well, I will tell you this from the conversation.
[02:56:30.040 --> 02:56:39.342]  When we walked in there, the White House photographer was there and President Trump said, now that is the most highly paid
[02:56:40.325 --> 02:56:44.147]  Photographer in the entire world and completely worth it.
[02:56:44.147 --> 02:56:46.029]  So we got great great photos.
[02:56:46.029 --> 02:56:46.969]  Oh, so that wasn't you?
[02:56:46.969 --> 02:56:48.390]  That was the White House photographer?
[02:56:48.390 --> 02:56:48.930]  Yeah.
[02:56:48.930 --> 02:56:50.471]  I was wondering why it looks so damn good.
[02:56:50.471 --> 02:56:55.855]  I was like, wow, you take these too?
[02:56:55.855 --> 02:56:57.856]  They should be coming through soon.
[02:56:57.856 --> 02:56:59.077]  There should be a lot more.
[02:56:59.077 --> 02:57:00.738]  So we'll see what those look like.
[02:57:00.738 --> 02:57:02.119]  They should look just as good.
[02:57:02.119 --> 02:57:06.622]  I want to do five more minutes with you and then Tommy Robinson, political prisoner facing
[02:57:07.608 --> 02:57:10.709]  I mean, he's already served three months of a 30-month deal.
[02:57:10.709 --> 02:57:12.609]  He got out on appeal.
[02:57:12.609 --> 02:57:13.530]  He's about to go back in.
[02:57:13.530 --> 02:57:14.110]  This is incredible.
[02:57:14.110 --> 02:57:14.550]  He's enjoying it.
[02:57:14.550 --> 02:57:16.991]  So then we're going to have Gerald Solontay take over.
[02:57:16.991 --> 02:57:20.051]  But I want to get back into the red-button White House thing.
[02:57:20.051 --> 02:57:22.992]  I want to just walk through that, because that is big news.
[02:57:22.992 --> 02:57:24.153]  Now you said they'll try to spin that.
[02:57:24.153 --> 02:57:26.673]  I want to have you at the chance to lay all that out.
[02:57:26.673 --> 02:57:28.894]  Folks, follow his work at CarpeDontum.
[02:57:29.807 --> 02:57:31.750]  And YouTube at Carpe Dantum.
[02:57:31.750 --> 02:57:33.333]  And hopefully soon he'll be launching a website.
[02:57:33.333 --> 02:57:34.896]  He was telling me yesterday he's going to launch a website soon.
[02:57:34.896 --> 02:57:36.158]  We're excited about that.
[02:57:36.158 --> 02:57:37.180]  Because here, I just want to win.
[02:57:37.180 --> 02:57:42.989]  And I want to see Carpe Dantum grow more powerful than we can possibly imagine.
[02:57:45.247 --> 02:57:46.568]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[02:57:46.568 --> 02:57:47.348]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[02:57:47.348 --> 02:57:47.929]  Thanks for holding.
[02:57:47.929 --> 02:57:51.271]  Hey, uh, yeah, I just want to say, uh, your show is a breath of fresh air.
[02:57:51.271 --> 02:57:57.394]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City, and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[02:57:57.394 --> 02:58:06.199]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public approaching 2020.
[02:58:06.199 --> 02:58:07.360]  That's it.
[02:58:07.360 --> 02:58:10.002]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[02:58:10.002 --> 02:58:12.863]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[02:58:12.863 --> 02:58:14.144]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[02:58:14.304 --> 02:58:15.064]  I agree entirely.
[02:58:15.064 --> 02:58:20.507]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[02:58:20.507 --> 02:58:23.288]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[02:58:23.288 --> 02:58:25.349]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[02:58:25.349 --> 02:58:34.614]  But if they do shut you down, know you've gone into this war, you've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[02:58:34.614 --> 02:58:36.514]  We're going to keep fighting in the input war.
[02:58:36.514 --> 02:58:42.997]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[02:58:42.997 --> 02:58:43.938]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[02:58:48.036 --> 02:58:52.159]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:58:52.159 --> 02:58:58.462]  Viewers and listeners, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you, and we're under unprecedented evil attacks as you've seen.
[02:58:58.462 --> 02:59:10.669]  But I wanted to take just a minute out here, from the bottom of my heart, to tell you how much it means to me that when you saw those lies against us last week, the worst things you can say about people, that you knew they were liars, you went and looked it up and found out the truth.
[02:59:10.669 --> 02:59:17.053]  And so I feel very strong, and I feel God's hand on my shoulder, and I feel your love in my heart, and I want you to know that love is right back
[02:59:17.073 --> 02:59:17.413]  Thank you.
[02:59:49.682 --> 02:59:52.306]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:05.612 --> 03:00:08.774]  One of the top meme makers in the world.
[03:00:08.774 --> 03:00:14.116]  Carpe, I want to finish the story or recap it about Trump and the big red button.
[03:00:14.116 --> 03:00:16.377]  But briefly, why is it?
[03:00:16.377 --> 03:00:18.058]  Because it's been proven statistically.
[03:00:18.058 --> 03:00:19.139]  Even the UN admits it.
[03:00:19.139 --> 03:00:21.260]  The CIA looks at it.
[03:00:21.260 --> 03:00:26.002]  Their AI can't scan a meme, a video, an image and tell if it's funny or not.
[03:00:26.002 --> 03:00:30.344]  So they're having trouble censoring humor because the machines have trouble blocking it.
[03:00:30.344 --> 03:00:32.705]  Leftists can't understand it because they're machines.
[03:00:32.705 --> 03:00:33.926]  Why can't the left
[03:00:38.437 --> 03:00:39.738]  So I've said this for a long time.
[03:00:39.738 --> 03:00:58.389]  The reason that I think that the left is so ineffective in memes and really in comedy in general right now is that it all comes from this place of anger and upset feelings and all of these negative emotions.
[03:00:58.389 --> 03:01:01.151]  And when you're trying to produce something funny, that
[03:01:03.027 --> 03:01:16.810]  That emotion bleeds through and so everything you do gets tainted by this like this anger and it feels like a roast, not a good natured or a funny kind of thing.
[03:01:16.810 --> 03:01:22.712]  It feels like just that mean, you know, say the worst thing you can say kind of stuff.
[03:01:23.470 --> 03:01:34.692]  Whereas somebody from like the right like myself, I'm always approaching it as what's funny, you know, poke fun, but you don't have to destroy the person.
[03:01:34.692 --> 03:01:37.493]  I mean, if you destroy them accidentally, sure.
[03:01:37.493 --> 03:01:45.995]  But like when I was going after Biden or when I go after anybody, I'm always trying to find the funny things, not I'm not I'm not trying to like
[03:01:46.880 --> 03:01:48.161]  I'm not trying to be mean to them.
[03:01:48.161 --> 03:01:51.082]  I'm trying to poke fun at their weaknesses.
[03:01:51.082 --> 03:01:53.062]  And that will do the job.
[03:01:53.062 --> 03:01:55.724]  Especially if they come back at me and don't do that.
[03:01:55.724 --> 03:01:56.804]  Well, that's exactly it.
[03:01:56.804 --> 03:02:01.926]  You're just magnifying Strzok like a total demon.
[03:02:01.926 --> 03:02:03.587]  And then you just put fire and horns on him.
[03:02:03.587 --> 03:02:06.908]  I mean, you just take the truth and then just focus on it.
[03:02:07.776 --> 03:02:08.457]  Right.
[03:02:08.457 --> 03:02:14.323]  Now with the left though, I mean, they, uh, they also just, they use very crass humor.
[03:02:14.323 --> 03:02:24.855]  I mean, uh, I can't tell you how many like homophobic or, uh, like just terrible, like sexual memes are made about president Trump from the left.
[03:02:26.599 --> 03:02:27.400]  It's just not funny.
[03:02:27.400 --> 03:02:30.001]  I mean, they make stuff that's gross.
[03:02:30.001 --> 03:02:31.842]  Like, just disgusting.
[03:02:31.842 --> 03:02:32.463]  That's their thing.
[03:02:32.463 --> 03:02:34.644]  They follow none of their own rules.
[03:02:34.644 --> 03:02:36.205]  Oh, of course not.
[03:02:36.205 --> 03:02:37.686]  Which we wouldn't even do that stuff anyway.
[03:02:37.686 --> 03:02:39.047]  So, in closing, you're amazing.
[03:02:39.047 --> 03:02:40.168]  Hope you come back soon.
[03:02:40.168 --> 03:02:43.210]  We'll talk to you after the big summit coming up on Thursday.
[03:02:43.210 --> 03:02:44.611]  Carpe Diem.
[03:02:44.611 --> 03:02:45.711]  The red button story.
[03:02:45.711 --> 03:02:46.552]  Recap that for us.
[03:02:48.302 --> 03:02:56.227]  So we're standing in the Oval Office, we've just taken some pictures and he talked to my kids and he says, you know what that red button does?
[03:02:56.227 --> 03:02:58.208]  And they didn't know.
[03:02:58.208 --> 03:02:59.949]  And he said, well let's press it and find out.
[03:02:59.949 --> 03:03:02.951]  Some people say that it launches nukes.
[03:03:02.951 --> 03:03:12.396]  So he goes over and presses it and then kind of looks around and the kids are looking around to see what happens and then one of the Secret Service says, I'm right here Mr. President.
[03:03:12.396 --> 03:03:15.278]  So that's, it was a funny moment.
[03:03:15.965 --> 03:03:17.887]  But there's the other red button.
[03:03:17.887 --> 03:03:19.548]  That one didn't work out so well.
[03:03:19.548 --> 03:03:33.239]  Yeah, so Hillary can make her jokes, but as you said, you're saying this for the first time, and you were worried before you told the story, you said earlier that they'll be like, oh, he joked around and manipulated the Secret Service, or oh, he was joking about nuclear war.
[03:03:33.239 --> 03:03:36.422]  No, he was teasing kids and having a moment of excitement.
[03:03:36.422 --> 03:03:37.242]  Something they'll remember forever.
[03:03:37.242 --> 03:03:40.545]  That's the thing I know about Trump is he loves to have fun with everybody.
[03:03:41.696 --> 03:03:43.018]  Oh yeah, he was great.
[03:03:43.018 --> 03:03:47.843]  You can tell from just a couple photos there that he was great with my kids.
[03:03:47.843 --> 03:03:51.306]  He talked to them and he talked to all of us.
[03:03:51.306 --> 03:03:52.908]  But they had a great time in there.
[03:03:52.908 --> 03:03:55.231]  I was paranoid the whole time I was in there.
[03:03:55.231 --> 03:03:57.133]  I wasn't really that nervous talking to him.
[03:03:57.133 --> 03:04:00.857]  It felt kind of like an old friend kind of situation.
[03:04:01.437 --> 03:04:11.449]  But I was paranoid that my son was going to knock over the model, the Air Force One model, and break it.
[03:04:11.449 --> 03:04:13.131]  That was what I was worried about the whole time.
[03:04:13.131 --> 03:04:20.960]  So I was like kind of out of the corner of my eye, always watching him, make sure he wouldn't knock that model over and then like have to buy a new million dollar model or whatever that thing costs.
[03:04:22.541 --> 03:04:23.241]  Amazing.
[03:04:23.241 --> 03:04:24.842]  Well, I tell you, Trump's the real deal.
[03:04:24.842 --> 03:04:26.983]  He gets energy off of empowering people.
[03:04:26.983 --> 03:04:28.744]  And he wants to empower America.
[03:04:28.744 --> 03:04:30.145]  That's why they're so pissed.
[03:04:30.145 --> 03:04:31.446]  There's not just evil in the universe.
[03:04:31.446 --> 03:04:32.266]  There's good as well.
[03:04:32.266 --> 03:04:33.687]  And Trump is definitely good.
[03:04:33.687 --> 03:04:34.888]  Carpe Dantum.
[03:04:34.888 --> 03:04:35.848]  You're empowering me.
[03:04:35.848 --> 03:04:36.528]  I'm empowering you.
[03:04:36.528 --> 03:04:37.829]  We're empowering the president.
[03:04:37.829 --> 03:04:39.250]  He's empowering us.
[03:04:39.250 --> 03:04:40.671]  And good is on the rise again.
[03:04:40.671 --> 03:04:43.772]  We look forward to talking to you after the big shum it on Thursday.
[03:04:43.772 --> 03:04:46.093]  And we salute your work, my friend.
[03:04:46.093 --> 03:04:48.134]  Thanks for having me, man.

[03:06:32.250 --> 03:06:34.391]  We are not standing here idle and doing nothing.
[03:06:34.391 --> 03:06:37.792]  We're fighting, and fighting hard.
[03:06:37.792 --> 03:06:45.854]  And one of our champions, who's delivered in Europe and the UK like no other, is facing death.
[03:06:45.854 --> 03:06:50.175]  He's already been asked and attacked, year in jail for exposing child kidnapping rings.
[03:06:50.175 --> 03:06:56.457]  Instead of being hauled on the shoulders of the people of the UK, he's facing prison again, and he wanted to finish up before Gerald Solynte comes on.
[03:06:57.864 --> 03:07:16.672]  With his whole rundown of how the three convictions, not of a jury, but of these corrupt judges, and the prison they intend to inflict on him as a victory of evil, on Thursday, 48 hours away, Tommy Robinson finished up your report that we're going to combine together and give to the President.
[03:07:16.672 --> 03:07:24.495]  Alex, I've shown you my first, the fact that I was supposed to cause anxiety to these grooming gang
[03:07:25.197 --> 03:07:26.338]  Pedophiles.
[03:07:26.338 --> 03:07:29.039]  I've showed you the BBC report doing exactly the same.
[03:07:29.039 --> 03:07:36.144]  I've showed you the law on the judiciary's website that they cannot prevent you reporting what's already in the public domain.
[03:07:36.144 --> 03:07:40.026]  There's not ever been any question that anything I said wasn't in the public domain.
[03:07:40.026 --> 03:07:42.127]  I didn't report on the proceedings.
[03:07:42.127 --> 03:07:45.209]  I reported information that was already on the BBC News website.
[03:07:45.817 --> 03:07:56.903]  I've showed you the severity of other people's and other journalists' reporting, which has resulted in prejudicing trials, collapsing murder trials, escaping justice for murderers.
[03:07:56.903 --> 03:07:57.964]  You've seen all of them.
[03:07:57.964 --> 03:07:58.864]  Fines.
[03:07:58.864 --> 03:08:00.705]  I've compared them.
[03:08:00.705 --> 03:08:05.128]  Now ask yourself, those more severe breaches got small fines.
[03:08:05.128 --> 03:08:09.350]  Ask yourself why I received a 30-month prison sentence in a kangaroo court back in Leeds.
[03:08:10.179 --> 03:08:18.446]  It's because the British state's politically motivated attempt at shutting down and dissenting voices and genuinely trying to have me killed by Muslim gangs in prison.
[03:08:18.446 --> 03:08:28.896]  There can be no other reason why, when I was given 13 months, I was moved from the safety of Hull Prison to the most densely Muslim populated prison in this country.
[03:08:29.614 --> 03:08:31.275]  That's where they moved me to.
[03:08:31.275 --> 03:08:36.157]  Now in this country, this is the dangerous thing which everyone should be up in arms about.
[03:08:36.157 --> 03:08:47.202]  If a defendant is accused of a crime that can land them in prison for more than six months, it's the law of this land that they must stand in front of a jury of their peers to ensure fair justice.
[03:08:47.882 --> 03:08:58.388]  This contempt court charge holds a two-year prison sentence, yet they're refusing me a jury of my peers because they know full well 12 ordinary members of the British public would throw this out.
[03:08:58.388 --> 03:08:59.809]  I would be found not guilty.
[03:08:59.809 --> 03:09:08.534]  This is the back doorway of the Attorney General and the government effectively sentenced me to death in prison by bypassing a trial by jury.
[03:09:08.534 --> 03:09:15.118]  Even people who don't agree with me and they don't like my views can see how unbelievably corrupt this entire process is.
[03:09:15.842 --> 03:09:25.827]  The fact the judge has heard all the details I've just relayed to you, yet still found me guilty, makes an embarrassment of the British legal system to the one that was once respected across the world.
[03:09:26.880 --> 03:09:27.620]  They do not care.
[03:09:27.620 --> 03:09:28.340]  You've seen them.
[03:09:28.340 --> 03:09:31.321]  You've seen the betrayal of Brexit and democracy.
[03:09:31.321 --> 03:09:32.221]  Everything.
[03:09:32.221 --> 03:09:33.242]  And people need to wake up.
[03:09:33.242 --> 03:09:38.483]  There are a handful of elites who are connected and they actually don't give a damn what the people actually want or vote for.
[03:09:38.483 --> 03:09:40.763]  They don't care about the British justice system.
[03:09:40.763 --> 03:09:43.044]  Looks an absolute joke across this world.
[03:09:43.044 --> 03:09:45.325]  All they care about is getting what they want.
[03:09:45.325 --> 03:09:48.945]  We are run by nothing but a globalist dictatorship.
[03:09:48.945 --> 03:09:49.926]  They moan about Russia.
[03:09:49.926 --> 03:09:50.866]  They moan about China.
[03:09:50.866 --> 03:09:52.826]  They moan about the clampdown on free speech.
[03:09:52.826 --> 03:09:55.187]  They're the biggest bunch of hypocrites walking this planet.
[03:09:55.856 --> 03:09:58.978]  They are traitors that are ruining my beautiful country.
[03:09:58.978 --> 03:10:02.339]  They're removing our fundamental freedoms step by step, day by day.
[03:10:02.339 --> 03:10:04.460]  Every day we're losing our freedoms.
[03:10:04.460 --> 03:10:13.604]  I want to make a genuine appeal to President Trump, to the Republican Party, please consider me and my family for political asylum.
[03:10:13.604 --> 03:10:25.050]  The British state's appeasement to Islam, the unrestricted waves of migrants into this country means that they are deliberately persecuting and illegally imprisoning anyone who speaks out against their globalist agenda.
[03:10:25.956 --> 03:10:33.342]  There are Islamic terrorists already serving 30 years in prison that were caught with guns, knives and IEDs on their way to murder me.
[03:10:33.342 --> 03:10:44.930]  The British state has issued me already with nine government official Osman warnings, informing me that there are credible intelligence that Islamic extremists or far-left extremists are plotting to murder me and my family.
[03:10:44.930 --> 03:10:51.936]  Despite this, they refuse to provide me with any of the details of their intelligence, yet they inform me that I cannot take steps to protect myself.
[03:10:51.936 --> 03:10:53.577]  I cannot even defend myself.
[03:10:54.338 --> 03:10:59.541]  I'm asking for political asylum for the safety of my wife, my three beautiful children.
[03:10:59.541 --> 03:11:04.023]  If you have watched this video, you have seen the complete sham of a persecution.
[03:11:04.023 --> 03:11:06.945]  My legal team will now look at every avenue to appeal.
[03:11:06.945 --> 03:11:08.886]  The only option I have is to fight.
[03:11:08.886 --> 03:11:12.048]  If I'm put in prison, the only option I have is to fight.
[03:11:12.048 --> 03:11:15.490]  Every time I walk out my door, the only option I have is to fight.
[03:11:15.490 --> 03:11:20.693]  So I only know how to fight and I'll fight it if I'm... I'm asking for political asylum but if I'm left here,
[03:11:21.374 --> 03:11:22.414]  I get my written judgment.
[03:11:22.414 --> 03:11:25.515]  I'm waiting on my written judgment for how I've been found guilty.
[03:11:25.515 --> 03:11:34.358]  This prosecution has already cost, which is one of the reasons they stick it on me as well, it's cost over £115,000 in legal fees.
[03:11:34.358 --> 03:11:36.098]  The costs continue to escalate.
[03:11:36.098 --> 03:11:44.521]  I need to lodge an appeal as quickly as possible so I can work towards getting me released so I can prevent my murder in prison.
[03:11:45.643 --> 03:11:53.847]  Anyone who can help or support, we have an appeal fund, we have a website, it's tommyappeal.com.
[03:11:53.847 --> 03:12:02.612]  I am, my real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, but we are all Tommy Robinson.
[03:12:02.612 --> 03:12:07.475]  Our freedoms in Britain are eroding, they're being taken.
[03:12:07.475 --> 03:12:13.518]  This is a plea to America and a warning to the United States, a warning to every single one of you.
[03:12:14.167 --> 03:12:17.428]  You see the opposition, the people and the groups that oppose you.
[03:12:17.428 --> 03:12:19.509]  The dark forces at work.
[03:12:19.509 --> 03:12:21.209]  The report.
[03:12:21.209 --> 03:12:22.550]  President Trump.
[03:12:22.550 --> 03:12:25.531]  The false dossier of Russia.
[03:12:25.531 --> 03:12:31.933]  The false Russian dossier was created here by someone working for our government.
[03:12:31.933 --> 03:12:35.054]  That's the level of deep, dark corruption in my country.
[03:12:35.054 --> 03:12:40.636]  They've built against you and worked against you and I'm pleading with you.
[03:12:40.636 --> 03:12:42.417]  I will be left to be murdered in this country.
[03:12:43.334 --> 03:12:51.160]  I'm a journalist and I'm going to be sentenced to prison on Thursday for journalism.
[03:12:51.160 --> 03:13:00.308]  The country you think you understand, the country you look to, the country that many people admire around the world, it's gone.
[03:13:00.308 --> 03:13:03.010]  It's changed.
[03:13:03.010 --> 03:13:08.254]  The level of corruption, we knew we had a corrupt media.
[03:13:08.254 --> 03:13:09.255]  We knew that.
[03:13:09.255 --> 03:13:10.036]  We all know that.
[03:13:10.689 --> 03:13:12.390]  We witnessed it all the time.
[03:13:12.390 --> 03:13:21.897]  We knew by the cover-ups, by the government and the police force, that we had a corrupt police all aligning and cooperating together to suppress the truth about the rape of a generation.
[03:13:21.897 --> 03:13:23.078]  Understand this.
[03:13:23.078 --> 03:13:25.520]  When I talk about these issues, understand this.
[03:13:25.520 --> 03:13:27.321]  This happened to a relative of mine.
[03:13:27.321 --> 03:13:29.883]  She was a victim of one of these gangs.
[03:13:29.883 --> 03:13:34.566]  I have travelled across this country meeting the families, meeting the victims.
[03:13:34.566 --> 03:13:37.408]  They, you know, if people understood the true length,
[03:13:38.112 --> 03:13:39.514]  And the numbers.
[03:13:39.514 --> 03:13:44.299]  And it goes against their vision that they want for this world.
[03:13:44.299 --> 03:13:46.601]  This open border policy.
[03:13:46.601 --> 03:13:48.964]  All cultures are equal.
[03:13:48.964 --> 03:13:50.145]  Everyone's the same.
[03:13:51.167 --> 03:13:57.510]  It completely contradicts it when a culture comes in and enslaves a generation of our daughters.
[03:13:57.510 --> 03:13:59.571]  And it's that that they're trying to hide.
[03:13:59.571 --> 03:14:02.853]  It's the embarrassment that I bring with my news reports.
[03:14:02.853 --> 03:14:08.536]  I worked on the biggest expose of the BBC this country's ever seen.
[03:14:08.536 --> 03:14:10.857]  A documentary called Panadrama.
[03:14:10.857 --> 03:14:15.399]  Five days after Panadrama, these charges were re-bought against me.
[03:14:15.399 --> 03:14:19.641]  24 hours after Panadrama, Big Tech, social media, YouTube,
[03:14:20.376 --> 03:14:26.659]  Facebook all removed me because I exposed exactly the accusations you make, President Trump.
[03:14:26.659 --> 03:14:30.441]  The accusations you make of the BBC being fake news.
[03:14:30.441 --> 03:14:32.442]  I caught it all on camera.
[03:14:32.442 --> 03:14:34.303]  I caught it all on camera and guess what?
[03:14:34.303 --> 03:14:39.265]  In the biggest expose, not one single British journalist mentioned it.
[03:14:39.265 --> 03:14:41.586]  That is the proof of a corrupt media.
[03:14:41.586 --> 03:14:42.827]  That is the proof.
[03:14:42.827 --> 03:14:45.568]  They are not journalists, they are activists.
[03:14:45.568 --> 03:14:48.890]  And they're working against the sole interest of the people of this country.
[03:14:49.969 --> 03:14:53.492]  The country I love.
[03:14:53.492 --> 03:15:02.718]  And I ask again, if you're watching this, if you're in the administration of President Trump, Donald Trump Jr.
[03:15:02.718 --> 03:15:04.459]  I'm pleading with you.
[03:15:04.459 --> 03:15:07.061]  Please raise concerns over this case.
[03:15:07.061 --> 03:15:13.506]  I promise you, all of the information, all my own barristers have said they've gone against the law.
[03:15:13.506 --> 03:15:19.430]  My own barristers said that it's impossible for me to get convicted, yet I've been found guilty of all three charges.
[03:15:20.931 --> 03:15:28.643]  Tommy, we get that you're a trooper, and this is about the rape and enslavement of a generation, and it's up to the audience and the listeners to send the videos.
[03:15:28.643 --> 03:15:34.613]  We're going to post to Infowars.com, to WhiteHouse.gov, to all the radio and TV stations to make a big issue out of this.
[03:15:34.613 --> 03:15:35.714]  You should join us again tomorrow.
[03:15:36.752 --> 03:15:40.056]  With a countdown to them trying to make you a political prisoner.
[03:15:40.056 --> 03:15:41.317]  And we appreciate you.
[03:15:41.317 --> 03:15:43.139]  You've done a great job.
[03:15:43.139 --> 03:15:44.821]  Working people, we're only 10 seconds left.
[03:15:44.821 --> 03:15:46.803]  Where's the best place to follow?

[03:17:54.292 --> 03:17:55.633]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[03:17:55.633 --> 03:17:56.413]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[03:17:56.413 --> 03:17:56.973]  Thanks for holding.
[03:17:56.973 --> 03:17:57.514]  Hey, Alex.
[03:17:57.514 --> 03:18:00.335]  Yeah, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air.
[03:18:00.335 --> 03:18:06.459]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City, and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[03:18:06.459 --> 03:18:15.244]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public approaching 2020.
[03:18:15.244 --> 03:18:16.404]  That's it.
[03:18:16.404 --> 03:18:19.066]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[03:18:19.066 --> 03:18:21.907]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[03:18:21.907 --> 03:18:23.188]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[03:18:23.368 --> 03:18:24.108]  I agree entirely.
[03:18:24.108 --> 03:18:29.549]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[03:18:29.549 --> 03:18:32.350]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[03:18:32.350 --> 03:18:34.410]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[03:18:34.410 --> 03:18:43.652]  But if they do shut you down, know you've gone into this war, you've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[03:18:43.652 --> 03:18:45.552]  We're going to keep fighting in the info war.
[03:18:45.552 --> 03:18:52.034]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[03:18:52.034 --> 03:18:52.974]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[03:18:54.949 --> 03:18:56.970]  Robert Morris, what has Big Tech become?
[03:18:56.970 --> 03:18:58.971]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies.
[03:18:58.971 --> 03:19:05.453]  And the way they did so is because they face no consequence, social, economic, political, or legal, for their illicit activities over two decades.
[03:19:05.453 --> 03:19:17.538]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this, have to bring real social, political, economic consequence to their course of conduct.
[03:19:17.538 --> 03:19:20.619]  Otherwise, they will never change, and they will become the Big Tech oligarchs
[03:19:20.779 --> 03:19:22.740]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening.
[03:19:50.737 --> 03:19:52.658]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[03:19:52.658 --> 03:19:57.201]  Even it is what you just saw.
[03:19:57.201 --> 03:20:10.809]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:10.809 --> 03:20:17.953]  Joe Celente's taking over right now.
[03:20:17.953 --> 03:20:19.855]  Pop Prince Forecaster, good friend of mine.
[03:20:20.652 --> 03:20:22.673]  I want to point something out.
[03:20:22.673 --> 03:20:30.975]  The new Spider-Man movie has a villain broadcaster that they're admitting in mainstream news is supposedly Alex Jones.
[03:20:30.975 --> 03:20:35.377]  He's a horrible criminal that sets people up.
[03:20:35.377 --> 03:20:36.177]  Did I go see the movie?
[03:20:36.177 --> 03:20:36.457]  No.
[03:20:36.457 --> 03:20:37.017]  Do I care?
[03:20:37.017 --> 03:20:37.337]  No.
[03:20:37.337 --> 03:20:38.378]  Because that doesn't matter.
[03:20:38.378 --> 03:20:41.999]  Everybody knows that's not true.
[03:20:41.999 --> 03:20:49.181]  And you talk about somebody like Tommy Robinson who was put in jail for a year when he exposed rape gangs 11 years ago.
[03:20:50.339 --> 03:20:56.881]  And then served three months in solitary confinement on a 30-month conviction for covering a rape trial.
[03:20:56.881 --> 03:20:58.262]  He's facing three charges.
[03:20:58.262 --> 03:20:59.242]  They've convicted him.
[03:20:59.242 --> 03:21:00.823]  The judges have.
[03:21:00.823 --> 03:21:02.344]  No jury.
[03:21:02.344 --> 03:21:06.065]  It's a death sentence.
[03:21:06.065 --> 03:21:10.467]  And he's just trying to warn people.
[03:21:10.467 --> 03:21:16.609]  But if Trump exposed it, if Trump gave him asylum to show what a police state the UK is, it'd be a big victory against tyranny.
[03:21:18.220 --> 03:21:19.821]  The truth is good people fall asleep.
[03:21:19.821 --> 03:21:21.223]  That's why it was spreading so fast.
[03:21:21.223 --> 03:21:29.910]  I just want to say this briefly because I didn't plug last hour with Carpe D'Antimon.
[03:21:29.910 --> 03:21:34.534]  It's a shell of products that make this show possible.
[03:21:34.534 --> 03:21:35.215]  We have the new
[03:21:37.694 --> 03:21:41.097]  Betsy Ross flag shirt when they banned that off Nike tennis shoes.
[03:21:41.097 --> 03:21:43.059]  I thought, hell, we ought to put a t-shirt out.
[03:21:43.059 --> 03:21:45.100]  I said, well, I'm going to print 4,000.
[03:21:45.100 --> 03:21:47.542]  One blue, one white, two different variants.
[03:21:47.542 --> 03:21:52.266]  One says, since 1776 with a flag.
[03:21:52.266 --> 03:21:54.408]  The other says, these colors don't run.
[03:21:54.408 --> 03:21:57.231]  On the back it says, America's Back and Fours dot com.
[03:21:59.099 --> 03:22:00.680]  There were 2,000 left of them this morning.
[03:22:00.680 --> 03:22:00.940]  I don't know.
[03:22:00.940 --> 03:22:02.661]  They're going to sell out probably today.
[03:22:02.661 --> 03:22:03.441]  Thank you for the support.
[03:22:03.441 --> 03:22:06.323]  It takes a lot more money than that, though, to fund this operation.
[03:22:06.323 --> 03:22:09.425]  Oh, you sell 4,000 shirts and make like $10 apiece on them.
[03:22:09.425 --> 03:22:10.805]  It takes a lot to do what we do here.
[03:22:10.805 --> 03:22:14.487]  We've got a lot of undercover stuff, a lot of behind-the-scenes things you don't know about.
[03:22:14.487 --> 03:22:18.510]  InfoWars is just the tip of the spear.
[03:22:18.510 --> 03:22:21.031]  There's a lot of things going on that people don't know about.
[03:22:22.247 --> 03:22:24.991]  Because that's the best way to act against the globalists.
[03:22:24.991 --> 03:22:29.057]  And so, uh, please go to InfoWarsTore.com, get your Betsy Ross flag shirt.
[03:22:29.991 --> 03:22:37.614]  It's the last day of the 4th of July specials, free shipping store-wide, double-paid free appointments, 50% off supplements, m4store.com.
[03:22:37.614 --> 03:22:39.275]  Without you, we won't continue to operate.
[03:22:39.275 --> 03:22:40.756]  So thank you all for your support.
[03:22:40.756 --> 03:22:44.717]  I turn this over now to Gerald Cilente, the Trends Forecaster, for the next 40 minutes or so.
[03:22:44.717 --> 03:22:46.318]  Appreciate him letting me take over a little bit.
[03:22:46.318 --> 03:22:47.138]  Tommy was behind.
[03:22:47.138 --> 03:22:49.279]  He had a lot more to cover.
[03:22:49.279 --> 03:22:56.563]  It's just a dark day when journalists are being put in prison for exposing what's happening.
[03:22:58.152 --> 03:22:59.513]  Evil's going to fall on the end.
[03:22:59.513 --> 03:23:01.914]  Gerald Salente, thank you for being here.
[03:23:01.914 --> 03:23:02.935]  Thanks for all that you do.
[03:23:02.935 --> 03:23:05.136]  And yes, journalists are in prison.
[03:23:05.136 --> 03:23:09.899]  Look at Julian Assange and all those Democratic liberals.
[03:23:09.899 --> 03:23:13.902]  They got lockjaw on that one, except Tulsi Gabbard.
[03:23:13.902 --> 03:23:14.983]  Journalism's dead.
[03:23:14.983 --> 03:23:16.744]  The fourth estate is dead.
[03:23:16.744 --> 03:23:22.707]  The first estate is the, you have the executive branch, congressional branch, and judicial branch.
[03:23:22.707 --> 03:23:26.990]  The fourth estate is the journalism branch, and journalism is gone.
[03:23:27.762 --> 03:23:31.203]  They've cut back reporters, and there's hardly any news.
[03:23:31.203 --> 03:23:40.925]  You look at the toilet paper record of the New York Times, you go to its business section today, and it's just a couple of pages of nothing, and mostly big pictures.
[03:23:40.925 --> 03:23:43.145]  So, it's very sad what's happened.
[03:23:43.145 --> 03:23:54.908]  So, it's very important that people tune into InfoWars and, of course, our magazine, the Trends Journal, to get the truth in trends and the truth in news, because you're not getting it anywhere else.
[03:23:54.908 --> 03:23:56.908]  As the mainstream media has been taken over,
[03:23:57.666 --> 03:24:01.790]  So nine, was it six companies over 90% of it.
[03:24:01.790 --> 03:24:04.632]  So they're not journalists, they're prostitutes.
[03:24:04.632 --> 03:24:11.157]  They get paid to put out by their corporate johns and their government whore masters.
[03:24:11.157 --> 03:24:13.399]  So press is dead.
[03:24:13.399 --> 03:24:18.744]  I'd like to talk about, I'm talking about a little bit about what's going on in the world today.
[03:24:18.744 --> 03:24:24.709]  They had an election over there in Greece yesterday and the fellow that won
[03:24:25.663 --> 03:24:26.384]  Great.
[03:24:26.384 --> 03:24:29.506]  His daddy was prime minister before him.
[03:24:29.506 --> 03:24:33.709]  Another guy born on third base and thought he had a home run.
[03:24:33.709 --> 03:24:34.629]  Harvard boy.
[03:24:34.629 --> 03:24:36.090]  Harvard, Princeton, Yale.
[03:24:36.090 --> 03:24:39.072]  Bullets, bombs, and banks.
[03:24:39.072 --> 03:24:41.754]  The jerk before him, Cyprus.
[03:24:41.754 --> 03:24:50.801]  And you know I'd like to say, but they'd bleep me out if I pronounced his name properly with the taking out the T on it.
[03:24:50.801 --> 03:24:52.522]  And what he did,
[03:24:53.413 --> 03:25:07.118]  Was the people voted against the austerity measures that the International Mafia Federation, labeled the International Monetary Fund, put on Greece.
[03:25:07.118 --> 03:25:10.600]  Over 60% of the people voted against the austerity measures.
[03:25:10.600 --> 03:25:17.363]  Tsipras, the guy that's on his way out now, we could care less what you want.
[03:25:17.363 --> 03:25:19.003]  We're in charge.
[03:25:19.003 --> 03:25:20.744]  And that's what it is around the world.
[03:25:21.423 --> 03:25:22.464]  Democracy?
[03:25:22.464 --> 03:25:22.824]  Duh!
[03:25:22.824 --> 03:25:26.226]  Democracy does not exist.
[03:25:26.226 --> 03:25:28.967]  How about those clowns over there in the European Union?
[03:25:28.967 --> 03:25:33.430]  Oh, they just voted in a number of people.
[03:25:33.430 --> 03:25:44.116]  Matter of fact, one of them to head the European Central Bank is Christine Lagarde, the former head of the IMF, the International Mafia Federation.
[03:25:44.116 --> 03:25:48.199]  And all the other three people they put into top positions, nobody voted.
[03:25:48.199 --> 03:25:50.260]  They decided, we'll decide for you.
[03:25:52.102 --> 03:26:01.825]  You know, there's going to be a movement on Facebook that anybody says don't get out to vote in the 2020 elections, they're going to ban it.
[03:26:01.825 --> 03:26:08.447]  And so there's a big movement underway to ban people that aren't going to vote.
[03:26:08.447 --> 03:26:15.309]  What if you don't want to support the repulsive kins and democrats?
[03:26:15.309 --> 03:26:18.750]  What if you want a new way, like many other countries have?
[03:26:18.750 --> 03:26:20.451]  Not allowed in the U.S.S.A.
[03:26:21.266 --> 03:26:30.030]  We got the two ruling parties, the Bloods and the Crips, that morons and imbeciles call the Republicans and the Democrats.
[03:26:30.030 --> 03:26:35.213]  I say Bloods and the Crips because by their deeds you shall know them.
[03:26:35.213 --> 03:26:37.734]  They're murderers and they're thieves.
[03:26:37.734 --> 03:26:41.616]  They start wars based on lies and steal our money.
[03:26:41.616 --> 03:26:42.616]  Too big to fail.
[03:26:42.616 --> 03:26:47.899]  All people are worrying about capitalism being dead and socialism taking over.
[03:26:47.899 --> 03:26:49.820]  Capitalism is long dead.
[03:26:50.743 --> 03:26:54.324]  In capitalism, there's no such thing as too big to fail, eh?
[03:26:54.324 --> 03:26:58.405]  But we gotta protect our bankster buddies, you know?
[03:26:58.405 --> 03:27:04.046]  So talking about Greece, just some of the data.
[03:27:04.046 --> 03:27:08.727]  Greece's financial straitjacket is fueling a brain drain.
[03:27:08.727 --> 03:27:13.568]  Some 500,000 people have left the country from 2010 to 2017.
[03:27:13.568 --> 03:27:14.208]  It's the deepest
[03:27:20.501 --> 03:27:23.062]  Setback since the Great Depression in the 1930s.
[03:27:23.062 --> 03:27:40.166]  The Greece economy is still 24% smaller than it was... 24% smaller than it was in 2007.
[03:27:40.166 --> 03:27:46.407]  Those austerity measures worked perfectly!
[03:27:46.407 --> 03:27:48.928]  Yeah, they only have, I think, unemployment
[03:27:49.943 --> 03:27:53.004]  Oh, it's only 18 percent.
[03:27:53.004 --> 03:28:00.505]  But now they got in a guy.
[03:28:00.505 --> 03:28:06.306]  Mitsotakis.
[03:28:06.306 --> 03:28:09.566]  Stanford and Harvard.
[03:28:09.566 --> 03:28:12.127]  Daddy was Prime Minister before.
[03:28:12.127 --> 03:28:14.767]  So you know where this is going.
[03:28:14.767 --> 03:28:16.788]  More of the same.
[03:28:16.788 --> 03:28:17.948]  Just another country.
[03:28:18.769 --> 03:28:25.491]  In the multinational plantation of Slave-landia, Slave-landia.
[03:28:25.491 --> 03:28:30.453]  We're going to get rid of your social benefits, your retirement.
[03:28:30.453 --> 03:28:35.074]  We're going to move to after you die and forget about your pensions.
[03:28:35.074 --> 03:28:37.295]  They don't exist anymore.
[03:28:37.295 --> 03:28:40.136]  So, another corrupt government.
[03:28:40.136 --> 03:28:41.377]  More of the same.
[03:28:41.377 --> 03:28:42.237]  We're back in the field.
[03:28:53.840 --> 03:29:04.886]  When you have a pain in the neck, a real pain in the neck, back, shoulder or legs, you now have two convenient choices to get fast relief without taking another pill.

[03:29:54.514 --> 03:29:57.097]  I'll be very, very clear with everybody about all of this.
[03:29:57.097 --> 03:30:04.985]  We're going into the season of war and they have been inches from shutting down the final bank accounts we have through their criminal activity and their digital fraud.
[03:30:04.985 --> 03:30:08.668]  And we need to know that we've got capital to go six months, a year.
[03:30:08.668 --> 03:30:09.569]  We need to end here.
[03:30:09.569 --> 03:30:10.910]  We need to be provisioned.
[03:30:10.910 --> 03:30:14.474]  And you've got my total commitment that I am going to rampage forward against the
[03:30:14.514 --> 03:30:14.914]  I don't know.
[03:30:32.310 --> 03:30:39.735]  But literally, if you flood us with money, and if you flood us with product purchases, and if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable, we're unstoppable together.
[03:30:39.735 --> 03:30:41.136]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy.
[03:30:41.136 --> 03:30:48.181]  I want to raise a couple million dollars, right now, to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing, and that you will stand with us, and I will never back down.
[03:30:48.181 --> 03:30:49.162]  You have my commitment.
[03:30:49.162 --> 03:30:53.505]  This only gives me more energy, and more understanding of what we're facing, and that we were right about this.
[03:30:55.296 --> 03:31:11.964]  I talk about this on the air, and I know it sinks in to people, but I've decided that we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements, in that if you go back five, six years ago, before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it, I would talk about how great the products are, and how they were the best, and why they were, and I'd have doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good.
[03:31:11.964 --> 03:31:19.387]  And instead, the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us, or they'll shut us down, and the biggest thing people like to buy is supplements, because they know how great they are and how wonderful they were.
[03:31:19.747 --> 03:31:21.488]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[03:31:21.488 --> 03:31:25.731]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements.
[03:31:25.731 --> 03:31:33.677]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been to the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[03:31:33.677 --> 03:31:36.399]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them.
[03:31:36.399 --> 03:31:41.302]  And all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things.
[03:31:41.302 --> 03:31:42.483]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[03:31:42.483 --> 03:31:43.304]  They have side effects.
[03:31:43.464 --> 03:31:48.052]  Not with Mother Nature, but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest.
[03:31:48.052 --> 03:31:49.955]  Infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:31:55.026 --> 03:32:10.929]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena, in the public square, the other thing that's unique about InfoWars is it is the only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed by some billionaire, that's not being funded by a secret foreign government.
[03:32:10.929 --> 03:32:12.650]  It is completely independent of all that.
[03:32:12.650 --> 03:32:23.532]  It is an old-school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of the press and freedom of speech that, in fact, the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country, they actually tried to
[03:32:23.732 --> 03:32:24.272]  We're good to go.
[03:32:43.658 --> 03:32:45.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:17.140 --> 03:33:19.081]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:33:19.081 --> 03:33:29.723]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Gerald Cilente.
[03:33:29.723 --> 03:33:33.244]  Hey, hey, welcome back, welcome back.
[03:33:33.244 --> 03:33:35.565]  Well, the markets opened up today.
[03:33:35.565 --> 03:33:37.505]  So what's going on in the market world?
[03:33:37.505 --> 03:33:44.547]  Well, over there in Turkey over the weekend, Erdogan removed central bank chief Erdogan, of course.
[03:33:45.310 --> 03:34:05.141]  Here's El Presidente over there, the Prime Minister, or President, and he dismissed the Governor of Turkey's Central Bank during fresh investor concern over the independence of the institution, but a strain to combat inflation.
[03:34:05.141 --> 03:34:12.365]  I mention that because over the weekend, President Trump also took aim at the Federal Reserve,
[03:34:13.672 --> 03:34:16.213]  He said, quote, strong jobs report.
[03:34:16.213 --> 03:34:18.954]  Yeah, you saw that, those job numbers that came out.
[03:34:18.954 --> 03:34:22.435]  They were much stronger than anticipated.
[03:34:22.435 --> 03:34:31.578]  Low inflation and other countries around the world doing anything possible to take advantage of the United States, knowing that our Federal Reserve doesn't have a clue.
[03:34:31.578 --> 03:34:38.360]  They raised rates too soon, too often, and tightened, while others did just the opposite.
[03:34:39.901 --> 03:34:41.443]  Well, not all of them did the opposite.
[03:34:41.443 --> 03:34:44.006]  That's what got rid of the cat over there in Turkey.
[03:34:44.006 --> 03:34:45.407]  They kept raising interest rates.
[03:34:45.407 --> 03:34:53.316]  They're like a 24% interest rate over there, trying to stop inflation.
[03:34:53.316 --> 03:34:58.282]  So, the point I'm making is that, yes, the President could get rid of the Fed.
[03:34:59.062 --> 03:35:00.582]  They say that they can't, they do.
[03:35:00.582 --> 03:35:02.923]  They got rid of the cat in India as well.
[03:35:02.923 --> 03:35:04.283]  And let's get this straight.
[03:35:04.283 --> 03:35:06.944]  All these central banksters are connected.
[03:35:06.944 --> 03:35:08.144]  It's one big club.
[03:35:08.144 --> 03:35:11.545]  Or as George Carlin used to say, it's one big club and you're not in it.
[03:35:11.545 --> 03:35:20.488]  I just mentioned who became the clown boy now that's playing Prime Minister of Greece.
[03:35:20.488 --> 03:35:22.448]  Daddy was Prime Minister.
[03:35:22.448 --> 03:35:25.249]  Or President of Greece.
[03:35:25.249 --> 03:35:28.330]  And went to Harvard.
[03:35:29.704 --> 03:35:33.105]  Harvard, Princeton, Yale, bullets, bombs, and banks.
[03:35:33.105 --> 03:35:35.205]  One big club.
[03:35:35.205 --> 03:35:44.147]  So, on Friday, Trump said, if we had a Fed that would lower interest rates, we'd be like a rocket ship.
[03:35:44.147 --> 03:35:50.929]  But we're paying a lot of interest and it's unnecessary, but we don't have a Fed that knows what they're doing.
[03:35:50.929 --> 03:35:53.009]  So, it's one of those little things.
[03:35:53.009 --> 03:35:58.471]  But if we had a Fed that would lower rates, you would have a rocket ship.
[03:35:58.471 --> 03:35:59.311]  Yes and no.
[03:36:01.246 --> 03:36:07.790]  The low rates allow the big companies to get bigger.
[03:36:07.790 --> 03:36:11.572]  And stock buybacks is what they do with most of the cheap money they get.
[03:36:11.572 --> 03:36:16.895]  As we saw with the details in 2018 with the tax cuts.
[03:36:16.895 --> 03:36:24.720]  Nearly a trillion dollars was spent in stock buybacks.
[03:36:24.720 --> 03:36:28.562]  So the other thing low interest rates are, they're a war against savers.
[03:36:29.366 --> 03:36:38.333]  When I was a young boy, I used to have a thing called Savings and Loan Institutions.
[03:36:38.333 --> 03:36:41.656]  You put your money in a savings account and you got interest on it.
[03:36:41.656 --> 03:36:44.759]  Then you retire to Florida.
[03:36:44.759 --> 03:36:47.341]  Those days are gone.
[03:36:47.341 --> 03:36:53.026]  On the other hand, the low interest rates keep the economy moving.
[03:36:53.026 --> 03:36:57.269]  As interest rates go lower, you see the housing market going higher.
[03:36:57.269 --> 03:36:58.110]  And by the way,
[03:36:59.206 --> 03:37:11.170]  When you follow your trends and you look at the investment in the stock markets and the real estate sector, you're moving up nicely.
[03:37:11.170 --> 03:37:12.130]  Why?
[03:37:12.130 --> 03:37:15.851]  Because they expect lower rates and so do we.
[03:37:15.851 --> 03:37:21.373]  So we're going to know very shortly whether the Federal Reserve is going to lower interest rates this July.
[03:37:21.373 --> 03:37:25.194]  The bet was, the hope was for 50 basis points.
[03:37:25.194 --> 03:37:26.474]  It's only a 2.25 to 2.50 overnight rate right now.
[03:37:29.275 --> 03:37:39.147]  But now they're saying about a 25%, excuse me, yeah, 0.25%, not 25%, 0.25% interest rate cut.
[03:37:39.147 --> 03:37:41.750]  So it still looks like it's on the table.
[03:37:41.750 --> 03:37:44.654]  And the way you can tell it's on the table is by looking at gold prices.
[03:37:44.654 --> 03:37:47.978]  They came down from their recent high, but they're still around the $1400 level.
[03:37:50.290 --> 03:37:53.813]  If interest rates are going to go a lot higher, gold will go a lot lower.
[03:37:53.813 --> 03:37:57.416]  Because the higher the dollar goes, the lower gold follows.
[03:37:57.416 --> 03:38:03.662]  As with most commodities, because you buy about 40% of commodities, gold, are dollar-based.
[03:38:03.662 --> 03:38:08.306]  The higher the dollar goes, the more expensive is those commodities.
[03:38:08.306 --> 03:38:10.588]  So!
[03:38:10.588 --> 03:38:12.670]  Those prices go lower.
[03:38:12.670 --> 03:38:13.831]  So gold is holding up.
[03:38:15.143 --> 03:38:21.027]  I believe the Federal Reserve is going to aggressively lower interest rates between now and the 2020 elections.
[03:38:21.027 --> 03:38:24.670]  And that Trump does have power over them.
[03:38:24.670 --> 03:38:28.752]  Because you read the numbers coming out.
[03:38:28.752 --> 03:38:33.676]  And again, we just had the biggest monthly increase in US jobs for 2019.
[03:38:33.676 --> 03:38:36.758]  So that eased the concern of slowdowns.
[03:38:36.758 --> 03:38:38.119]  But when you look at other data,
[03:38:39.485 --> 03:38:41.866]  It's not that great around the world.
[03:38:41.866 --> 03:38:47.729]  China's factory activity in June was the lowest since January.
[03:38:47.729 --> 03:38:54.052]  China's short-term borrowing costs hit 10-year low after liquidity injections.
[03:38:54.052 --> 03:38:58.074]  Monetary methadone, that's all this is.
[03:38:58.074 --> 03:39:01.716]  Shoot more cheap money into the system to prop it up.
[03:39:01.716 --> 03:39:03.677]  They gotta do it.
[03:39:03.677 --> 03:39:06.458]  Ah, SUVs pile up
[03:39:07.335 --> 03:39:09.216]  With more on their way.
[03:39:09.216 --> 03:39:10.536]  This is just fresh news.
[03:39:10.536 --> 03:39:15.098]  Sales of Corsos and SUVs are slowing.
[03:39:15.098 --> 03:39:21.420]  While models are sitting longer in dealership lots before being sold.
[03:39:21.420 --> 03:39:28.823]  And companies are resorting to more sales promotions to keep inventory from piling up.
[03:39:28.823 --> 03:39:31.844]  Then you go back to some other little news.
[03:39:31.844 --> 03:39:32.824]  Ford's US sales fell 2.9%.
[03:39:38.732 --> 03:39:46.140]  Amid soft market.
[03:39:46.140 --> 03:39:50.925]  Go around the world.
[03:39:50.925 --> 03:39:57.452]  Germany's industrial orders fell 2.2 percent.
[03:39:57.452 --> 03:39:59.354]  Far more than expected in May.
[03:40:01.075 --> 03:40:13.363]  And the Economy Minister warned that this sector of Europe's largest economy was likely to remain weak in the coming months.
[03:40:13.363 --> 03:40:15.564]  You got a global slowdown.
[03:40:15.564 --> 03:40:23.769]  And Manufacturing Alliance COPPA weakens.
[03:40:23.769 --> 03:40:25.250]  This is a very important story.
[03:40:26.567 --> 03:40:28.648]  Current events form future trends.
[03:40:28.648 --> 03:40:33.469]  I'm going over these details to put things into perspective.
[03:40:33.469 --> 03:40:36.310]  In the business, we call it Dr. Copper.
[03:40:36.310 --> 03:40:37.490]  That's right.
[03:40:37.490 --> 03:40:46.753]  Dr. Copper, because copper is an indicator of the health of the global economy.
[03:40:46.753 --> 03:40:50.834]  China uses over 50% of all the new copper produced.
[03:40:50.834 --> 03:40:54.135]  Copper is used in everything from heavy industry to high tech.
[03:40:56.940 --> 03:41:03.404]  A retreat in copper prices is signaling continued investor concerns for the global economy.
[03:41:03.404 --> 03:41:20.292]  Copper, which is critical, they say, to construction and manufacturing, fell 1.7% last week, pairing some of its rally from June and bringing its decline from an April high to 11%.
[03:41:26.834 --> 03:41:32.597]  Prices have fallen in eight of the past ten weeks.
[03:41:32.597 --> 03:41:35.278]  There's a global slowdown going on.
[03:41:35.278 --> 03:41:43.622]  Oh, and by the way, it has nothing to do with trade wars, boys and girls and children of all ages.
[03:41:43.622 --> 03:41:50.745]  Just like those car sales, do Americans care about trade war going on and that's why they're not buying cars?
[03:41:50.745 --> 03:41:53.867]  But that's what happens when that happens in China.
[03:41:53.867 --> 03:41:56.008]  The media blames it on trade wars.
[03:41:57.352 --> 03:41:59.133]  Has nothing to do with it.
[03:41:59.133 --> 03:42:10.316]  By the way, China's yearly car sale numbers now, the worst since the 1990s in terms of a downturn.
[03:42:10.316 --> 03:42:12.336]  They blame it on trade wars.
[03:42:12.336 --> 03:42:14.997]  It's a slowing global economy.
[03:42:14.997 --> 03:42:22.799]  More monetary methadone and that's what's going to push gold prices up and keep them higher.
[03:42:22.799 --> 03:42:24.860]  So we believe gold is near its bottom.
[03:42:26.184 --> 03:42:31.105]  And I'll talk about, a little bit more, where it's top is.
[03:42:31.105 --> 03:42:33.126]  And again, I don't give financial advice.
[03:42:33.126 --> 03:42:35.186]  I'm a trend forecaster.
[03:42:35.186 --> 03:42:37.367]  And the forecast is becoming clearer and clearer.
[03:42:37.367 --> 03:42:41.748]  Be back in just a few minutes.
[03:42:41.748 --> 03:42:43.088]  Stay tuned.
[03:42:43.088 --> 03:42:50.731]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[03:42:50.731 --> 03:42:52.171]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:42:53.795 --> 03:42:57.978]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[03:42:57.978 --> 03:43:08.365]  So the InfoWars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another.
[03:43:08.365 --> 03:43:11.567]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale of
[03:43:11.667 --> 03:43:12.088]  I don't know.
[03:43:27.808 --> 03:43:36.974]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate-driven model.
[03:43:36.974 --> 03:43:45.579]  And the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[03:43:45.579 --> 03:43:48.901]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment.
[03:43:48.901 --> 03:43:52.283]  And it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[03:43:54.027 --> 03:43:58.817]  Serving with Info Wars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee.
[03:44:00.191 --> 03:44:09.599]  And luckily, our break room at the InfoWars headquarters is stocked full of high-quality InfoWars store Patriot Blend coffee.
[03:44:09.599 --> 03:44:21.248]  Grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico, the Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic, non-GMO coffee at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[03:44:21.248 --> 03:44:25.432]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[03:44:26.352 --> 03:44:30.373]  There has never been a more important time to support InfoWars.
[03:44:30.373 --> 03:44:37.275]  So if you love coffee and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.
[03:44:37.275 --> 03:44:40.195]  Order now at the InfoWars store.

[03:44:54.468 --> 03:44:58.634]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[03:44:58.634 --> 03:44:59.695]  They are technocrats.
[03:44:59.695 --> 03:45:02.018]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[03:45:02.018 --> 03:45:08.887]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions is in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[03:45:09.428 --> 03:45:11.210]  We're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[03:45:11.210 --> 03:45:13.692]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[03:45:13.692 --> 03:45:20.177]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[03:45:20.177 --> 03:45:25.362]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4warslife.com, I couldn't do it.
[03:45:25.362 --> 03:45:34.389]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality medical modelment and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[03:45:35.350 --> 03:45:41.336]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over-the-counter that you're going to find anywhere.
[03:45:41.336 --> 03:45:42.277]  It is amazing.

[03:47:15.997 --> 03:47:18.678]  It's Gerald Cilente.
[03:47:18.678 --> 03:47:24.881]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:24.881 --> 03:47:26.542]  Hey, welcome back, welcome back.
[03:47:26.542 --> 03:47:28.783]  It's great being on The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:28.783 --> 03:47:40.229]  I want to thank him for having me on and all the people at InfoWars to bring out the news you could use as they're censoring everything else around the world.
[03:47:40.229 --> 03:47:43.110]  Not only in the U.S.S.A., it's everywhere.
[03:47:43.979 --> 03:47:48.741]  You know those riots are going on over there in Hong Kong?
[03:47:48.741 --> 03:47:51.761]  People protesting the extradition law?
[03:47:51.761 --> 03:47:52.422]  Guess what?
[03:47:52.422 --> 03:47:54.122]  Not news in China.
[03:47:54.122 --> 03:47:55.683]  It's blanked out.
[03:47:55.683 --> 03:47:58.904]  It's like happening in America.
[03:47:58.904 --> 03:48:05.846]  Anyway, great being here and you know you have to do put your money where your heart is to keep InfoWars going.
[03:48:05.846 --> 03:48:08.967]  Because things are getting tougher as the censorship keeps getting deeper.
[03:48:09.702 --> 03:48:17.825]  So it's up to you to keep the truth alive and you can do that with the Betsy Ross 1776 limited edition shirt.
[03:48:17.825 --> 03:48:30.110]  Unlike the politically correct cowards, InfoWars is bringing you an all new design featuring the pride and joy of revolutionary America, the Betsy Ross flag.
[03:48:31.249 --> 03:48:43.811]  Now you can share with the world your patriotism and love of freedom, while letting the liberals and democrats know that these colors don't run.
[03:48:43.811 --> 03:48:53.753]  A limited edition print, which is $4,000 in stock, and I heard Alex say just before I went on the air that that stock's dropped a lot.
[03:48:53.753 --> 03:48:55.593]  There may not be many left.
[03:48:55.593 --> 03:48:59.074]  This shirt features two separate designs in two different colors.
[03:49:00.191 --> 03:49:02.653]  With only a thousand of each design.
[03:49:02.653 --> 03:49:04.095]  Again, less of those now.
[03:49:04.095 --> 03:49:11.501]  So you can choose between the Synth 7076 and these colors don't run.
[03:49:11.501 --> 03:49:14.564]  Tag lines with blue or white background.
[03:49:14.564 --> 03:49:18.888]  So, do what you can to support InfoWars and all the other great products.
[03:49:18.888 --> 03:49:22.491]  And you know me, I love that super male vitality.
[03:49:22.491 --> 03:49:25.033]  Yep.
[03:49:25.033 --> 03:49:27.055]  I mentioned before about the EU.
[03:49:28.171 --> 03:49:32.572]  Picking unelected leaders, and I couldn't remember all who they were.
[03:49:32.572 --> 03:49:44.574]  So, what they did over there was they got... German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen will head the European Commission.
[03:49:44.574 --> 03:49:51.296]  An ally of Angela Merkel, she's a major proponent of an EU super army.
[03:49:51.296 --> 03:49:52.516]  Spanish Foreign Minister,
[03:49:54.441 --> 03:49:58.582]  Joseph Fontales will run the EU foreign policy.
[03:49:58.582 --> 03:50:05.684]  Christine Lagarde will move from the International Mafia Federation to head the European Central Bank.
[03:50:05.684 --> 03:50:11.746]  And Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel will replace Tusk as European Council President.
[03:50:12.743 --> 03:50:20.985]  And all you little clowns in all those European nations, you didn't vote for one of them.
[03:50:20.985 --> 03:50:24.866]  They give it to you like everybody else.
[03:50:24.866 --> 03:50:27.686]  Oh, we need the EU, the EU, the FU.
[03:50:27.686 --> 03:50:28.707]  That's right.
[03:50:28.707 --> 03:50:30.307]  Spelt it wrong.
[03:50:30.307 --> 03:50:31.867]  Yeah.
[03:50:31.867 --> 03:50:33.568]  What a joke.
[03:50:33.568 --> 03:50:34.848]  It's no joke.
[03:50:34.848 --> 03:50:39.689]  And these clowns, these arrogant little boys and little girls, to be fair,
[03:50:43.385 --> 03:50:48.328]  It keeps invading foreign nations under the B.S.
[03:50:48.328 --> 03:50:56.073]  that they're bringing in democracy, as they don't have a hint of it over there, European Union.
[03:50:56.073 --> 03:50:59.535]  All you are is a colony of Germany.
[03:50:59.535 --> 03:51:03.377]  That's the quote.
[03:51:03.377 --> 03:51:07.079]  Mr. What is his name again?
[03:51:07.079 --> 03:51:07.960]  Savona.
[03:51:07.960 --> 03:51:08.520]  That's right.
[03:51:09.671 --> 03:51:14.674]  Mr. Savona, who is going to be EU's economic minister.
[03:51:14.674 --> 03:51:16.955]  But they wouldn't let him become one.
[03:51:16.955 --> 03:51:23.358]  Because all he said is that the rest of the countries would become colonies of Germany.
[03:51:23.358 --> 03:51:25.659]  Hallo Savona!
[03:51:25.659 --> 03:51:26.879]  And he's right.
[03:51:26.879 --> 03:51:34.003]  Because if Germans had the Deutschmark, rather than the worthless Euro,
[03:51:34.878 --> 03:51:42.060]  They wouldn't be able to sell their stuff the way they do, and be one of the world's largest exporters.
[03:51:42.060 --> 03:51:49.243]  So, moving on, and why you need to support InfoWars, and of course the Trends Journal.
[03:51:49.243 --> 03:51:52.064]  We're coming out with a new edition this week.
[03:51:52.064 --> 03:52:00.767]  Sunday talk shows falter in the ratings, face the nation, and meet the prostitutes.
[03:52:00.767 --> 03:52:01.227]  Declined 8%
[03:52:03.373 --> 03:52:17.116]  In 2018 to about 2.3 million average viewers, 2.3 million average viewers in a nation of over 320 million people.
[03:52:17.116 --> 03:52:29.938]  And this gets press that we have these major networks that barely anybody watches, but boy, are they great propagandists putting out the BS.
[03:52:32.401 --> 03:52:39.743]  The average audience, the evening newscast, ABC, CBS, NBC, 5.3 million.
[03:52:39.743 --> 03:52:45.605]  Again, in a nation of over 320 million.
[03:52:45.605 --> 03:52:50.186]  China must be jealous.
[03:52:50.186 --> 03:52:53.207]  You know, one of the things, I don't support Trump on a number of things.
[03:52:53.207 --> 03:52:55.967]  I'm not a believer in one person, one way.
[03:52:55.967 --> 03:52:58.268]  I say what I like, say what I don't like.
[03:52:58.268 --> 03:53:00.569]  I'm a political atheist.
[03:53:00.569 --> 03:53:01.769]  What I do support him with,
[03:53:02.608 --> 03:53:14.335]  Two issues, the borders, and you know me, I want to have a, I want to have a man, I want to have a, on the ballots, I want to have a referendum.
[03:53:14.335 --> 03:53:27.322]  Yes, I support open immigration and I'm willing to pay X amount of dollars in education, healthcare, and housing for each new immigrant.
[03:53:27.322 --> 03:53:27.502]  No.
[03:53:29.699 --> 03:53:36.144]  I want secure borders, and I'm willing to pay X amount of money to make it happen.
[03:53:36.144 --> 03:53:37.826]  Simple.
[03:53:37.826 --> 03:53:39.727]  Let the people vote.
[03:53:39.727 --> 03:53:48.154]  So, anyway, I agree with him on that, and of course I agree with him 100% on the trade issue.
[03:53:48.154 --> 03:53:50.616]  I disagree with tariffs.
[03:53:50.616 --> 03:53:58.262]  I say just put in place what used to exist before Slick Willie Clinton sold us out with NAFTA and the World Trade Organization.
[03:54:00.046 --> 03:54:04.249]  And bringing China into it.
[03:54:04.249 --> 03:54:19.841]  China's debt level went, before they came into the World Trade Association, from about a trillion dollars to over 40 trillion today.
[03:54:19.841 --> 03:54:22.603]  The middle class was 5%, now it's 35%.
[03:54:26.522 --> 03:54:33.367]  In other words, they have more middle class plus 100 million people in America as a nation.
[03:54:33.367 --> 03:54:35.228]  And I don't blame the Chinese for this.
[03:54:35.228 --> 03:54:47.036]  I blame the American companies and European companies for bringing all their technology and manufacturing there to have slaves make their stuff really cheaply and then bring it back and mark up the prices.
[03:54:47.036 --> 03:54:50.298]  So, trade gaps showed widening in May.
[03:54:52.205 --> 03:55:07.075]  Yep, the trade gap in goods and services jumped 8.4% in May to a seasonally adjusted $55.52 billion.
[03:55:07.075 --> 03:55:08.636]  Regarding U.S.
[03:55:08.636 --> 03:55:13.460]  trade with China, the bilateral goods deficit widened in May by 12%.
[03:55:16.041 --> 03:55:18.502]  Who would do business like this?
[03:55:18.502 --> 03:55:24.043]  You name me anybody in business that would do losing business like this.
[03:55:24.043 --> 03:55:28.504]  No one in the world.
[03:55:28.504 --> 03:55:43.908]  If a Democrat came out against... You're about a minute away from the end of what happened.
[03:55:46.340 --> 03:55:58.685]  Trying to reconnect, it's not letting me do it.
[03:55:58.685 --> 03:56:07.128]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:56:16.073 --> 03:56:18.437]  Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it.
[03:56:18.437 --> 03:56:20.120]  You know what I want to do?
[03:56:20.120 --> 03:56:22.724]  I want to get it finished.
[03:56:22.724 --> 03:56:24.888]  The prize I want is victory for the world.
[03:56:42.736 --> 03:56:47.240]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[03:56:47.240 --> 03:56:49.262]  Move, bitch!
[03:56:49.262 --> 03:56:50.023]  Get out the way!
[03:56:57.522 --> 03:56:58.662]  The American flag!
[03:56:58.662 --> 03:57:02.823]  Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[03:57:02.823 --> 03:57:06.064]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[03:57:06.064 --> 03:57:08.045]  I will not let you down.
[03:57:08.045 --> 03:57:10.806]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[03:57:10.806 --> 03:57:12.326]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[03:57:12.326 --> 03:57:14.727]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[03:57:14.727 --> 03:57:20.028]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[03:57:20.028 --> 03:57:22.749]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:57:22.749 --> 03:57:24.009]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:57:44.053 --> 03:57:48.477]  I just want listeners to understand, money is what allows us to beat this and stand against this.
[03:57:48.477 --> 03:57:56.104]  And we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the Save Info Wars 50% off, but we make only like $5, $10 on higher marked up stuff.
[03:57:56.104 --> 03:57:58.947]  We're making like $2 on the toothpaste at that price, and we're moving it.
[03:57:59.367 --> 03:58:00.047]  I don't
[03:58:18.793 --> 03:58:19.774]  I like to be expanding.
[03:58:19.774 --> 03:58:20.534]  I like to be winning.
[03:58:20.534 --> 03:58:21.254]  I like to be fighting.
[03:58:21.254 --> 03:58:22.435]  And we are winning the Infowar.
[03:58:22.435 --> 03:58:23.315]  That's why we're so hated.
[03:58:23.315 --> 03:58:24.936]  But we need to be retreaded.
[03:58:24.936 --> 03:58:26.176]  We need to be tuned up.
[03:58:26.176 --> 03:58:27.197]  We need to be fixed up.
[03:58:27.197 --> 03:58:28.537]  We never have time to get it dried up.
[03:58:28.537 --> 03:58:30.078]  We got a lot of holes shot at us.
[03:58:30.078 --> 03:58:34.920]  And if the enemy wants to silence us, then they're really going to plant child porn on us.
[03:58:34.920 --> 03:58:36.900]  Then they're going to kill me, or you, or anybody else.
[03:58:36.900 --> 03:58:41.202]  I mean, the Democrats now are going into a full revolutionary fervor, funded by foreign banks and the TICOM.
[03:58:41.202 --> 03:58:42.843]  So, go to InfowarStore.com.
[03:58:44.633 --> 03:58:45.954]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[03:58:45.954 --> 03:58:46.694]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[03:58:46.694 --> 03:58:47.314]  Thanks for holding.
[03:58:47.314 --> 03:58:47.835]  Hey, Alex.
[03:58:47.835 --> 03:58:50.676]  Yeah, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air.
[03:58:50.676 --> 03:58:56.780]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City, and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[03:58:56.780 --> 03:59:05.585]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public approaching 2020.
[03:59:05.585 --> 03:59:06.545]  That's it.
[03:59:06.545 --> 03:59:09.387]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[03:59:09.387 --> 03:59:12.248]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[03:59:12.248 --> 03:59:13.529]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[03:59:13.689 --> 03:59:14.449]  I agree entirely.
[03:59:14.449 --> 03:59:19.892]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[03:59:19.892 --> 03:59:22.674]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[03:59:22.674 --> 03:59:24.735]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[03:59:24.735 --> 03:59:33.999]  But if they do shut you down, know you've gone into this war, you've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[03:59:33.999 --> 03:59:35.900]  We're going to keep fighting in the info war.
[03:59:35.900 --> 03:59:42.383]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[03:59:42.383 --> 03:59:43.324]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[03:59:46.788 --> 03:59:49.386]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
