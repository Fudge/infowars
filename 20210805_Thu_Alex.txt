[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  You
[00:30.000 --> 00:32.000]  You
[00:32.000 --> 00:34.000]  You
[00:34.000 --> 00:40.000]  You
[00:54.560 --> 00:59.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this
[00:59.840 --> 01:01.840]  Live
[01:04.640 --> 01:07.360]  Thursday broadcast we're gonna go to rebroadcast for a while
[01:08.160 --> 01:10.480]  And we're gonna come back with very important news
[01:11.600 --> 01:13.840]  And information for you here today
[01:14.880 --> 01:18.480]  We have some very dire news and information that we're gonna be covering
[01:18.480 --> 01:23.520]  But hopefully if people care we can do something about it and turn the tide against this
[01:23.520 --> 01:29.120]  But again, I'll start the main transmission here in just a few minutes
[01:30.160 --> 01:32.160]  This is a very important report
[01:32.160 --> 01:34.160]  It's clip number one
[01:34.160 --> 01:39.360]  And you see the full report at man dot video covered vaccine truths ratchet up here it is
[01:44.080 --> 01:48.400]  Giving in to having these chains put on you only makes them put the chains on tire later
[01:48.480 --> 01:52.000]  So that's why they squeeze and then release squeeze again release again
[01:52.000 --> 01:56.160]  But each time getting tighter so by the time they've squeezed us down two or three times
[01:56.480 --> 02:01.600]  We'll be at a level we'll never be able to get out of and won't be resisting at the key moment when they finally break our net
[02:01.760 --> 02:07.120]  And we're entering that neck breaking area in the next year to two when they finally enforce these world IDs
[02:07.280 --> 02:11.440]  When people are starving in mass the borders are totally collapsed and they're gonna hold us hostage to say now
[02:11.600 --> 02:13.600]  It's your fault. You didn't take these IDs
[02:13.840 --> 02:17.840]  It's your fault. You didn't take these shots and even when you finally give in there's no food at the store
[02:17.840 --> 02:22.320]  And you know you take the shots. It's only going to get worse after that just like all these people that took the shots
[02:22.640 --> 02:27.280]  Because they were quote heroes that was going to make them invincible and now they learn they're actually the super spreaders
[02:27.360 --> 02:30.640]  They're the ones causing it the countries that have the highest rates of inoculation
[02:31.120 --> 02:36.480]  Have the highest rates of death and disease because it's all a trap. It's all a spiritual delusion
[02:36.800 --> 02:40.560]  You have to do is go back into the 1970s when swine flu
[02:41.040 --> 02:46.880]  Was an issue and they came up with the swine flu vaccine and I was I was working in a hospital as an orderly at that time
[02:46.880 --> 02:54.080]  Taking care of patients that had developed this neurologic problem called Guillain-Barre syndrome in response to the swine flu
[02:54.080 --> 02:58.800]  And we lost I think it was somewhere around 25 people and the United States which
[02:59.840 --> 03:02.880]  Didn't have a campaign of we're in this together and we care
[03:03.440 --> 03:05.440]  25 people was enough for the u.s
[03:06.080 --> 03:12.000]  population to get involved and for mainstream media 60 minutes to do a story on the swine flu vaccine
[03:12.000 --> 03:18.400]  Now here we are in 2021 and we're a great loving society and we're all in this together
[03:19.040 --> 03:24.800]  And mainstream media doesn't seem to have an interest in covering a story about tens of you know
[03:27.360 --> 03:29.360]  Eight nine ten thousand people in the u.s
[03:29.920 --> 03:35.200]  12,000 in in Europe. I don't just say this stuff. I'm shocking. I say they want to kill you and your family
[03:35.280 --> 03:40.000]  That's their goal. This equation has four factors a little bit of multiplication
[03:40.000 --> 03:43.520]  So you've got a thing on the left co2 that you want to get to zero
[03:44.160 --> 03:46.720]  And that's going to be based on the number of people
[03:47.600 --> 03:50.400]  The services each person's using on average
[03:50.960 --> 03:55.600]  The energy on average for each service and the co2 being put out
[03:56.240 --> 04:02.880]  Per unit of energy. So let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero
[04:03.600 --> 04:06.720]  Probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero
[04:06.720 --> 04:11.440]  Now that's back from high school algebra, but let's let's take a look
[04:12.480 --> 04:14.080]  First we've got population
[04:14.080 --> 04:20.000]  We have a hundred million people in this country john who are eligible to be vaccinated
[04:20.400 --> 04:22.400]  Who are not vaccinated?
[04:22.400 --> 04:24.400]  We've really got to get those people
[04:24.720 --> 04:28.960]  To change their minds make it easy for them convince them do something
[04:29.360 --> 04:34.160]  To get them to be vaccinated because they are the ones that are propagating this outbreak
[04:34.160 --> 04:37.040]  I hear Fauci and they see these other liars on tv
[04:38.080 --> 04:40.080]  saying this this lie
[04:40.240 --> 04:42.240]  99 of people dying
[04:42.640 --> 04:43.520]  have
[04:43.520 --> 04:48.160]  Not taken to the public shop and notice now even congress said give us those statistics. That was a week ago
[04:48.480 --> 04:51.840]  They won't do it. It does not exist
[04:52.560 --> 04:54.160]  So i'll cook numbers
[04:54.160 --> 04:59.840]  Where they counted from the beginning. All right folks. It's thursday august 5th. We're live. Stay with us back in 60 seconds
[04:59.840 --> 05:07.440]  It is through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told
[05:07.760 --> 05:11.520]  And the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses
[05:11.840 --> 05:14.640]  Which is why fluoridated water is a big problem
[05:15.200 --> 05:21.680]  Consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland and shuts down its natural functions
[05:22.080 --> 05:24.720]  Natural functions which have been known for millennia
[05:24.720 --> 05:30.880]  The hindu chakras align with the endocrine system. The chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye
[05:31.520 --> 05:37.760]  Also described as the seat of the soul the pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness
[05:38.240 --> 05:41.040]  And otherwise unseen dimensions of reality
[05:41.600 --> 05:46.080]  Fluoride free water is essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy
[05:46.480 --> 05:52.400]  Our water filtration systems with the proper filters will keep your drinking water fluoride free
[05:52.400 --> 05:55.120]  And the propure shower head will seal the deal
[05:55.680 --> 06:00.560]  Get them both today for yourself or a friend at infowarstore.com
[06:00.560 --> 06:19.840]  Defending the republic from enemies born and domestic it's alex jones
[06:31.040 --> 06:33.040]  Right
[06:43.920 --> 06:48.720]  Ladies and gentlemen momentous times we're live on this august 5th
[06:49.440 --> 06:52.560]  Thursday broadcast. I am your host alex jones
[06:53.280 --> 06:58.480]  We have several very informative big guests today, and I intend to open the phones up
[06:58.480 --> 07:00.480]  Ivory Hecker
[07:00.960 --> 07:06.960]  Is going to be in studio and she of course exposed the fact a month and a half ago here in texas in houston
[07:07.520 --> 07:14.160]  But she wasn't allowed to interview medical doctors that had big practices about stuff that was basically 100 effective against
[07:14.960 --> 07:16.960]  covid 19 because
[07:16.960 --> 07:20.800]  Big pharma wants to only put a ventilator on you and not even give you antibiotics
[07:21.440 --> 07:23.440]  Or antivirals or steroids
[07:24.240 --> 07:26.240]  for those that don't know
[07:26.240 --> 07:31.120]  I used to think people were dumb giving antibiotics for viral infections. It's the bacteria that infest
[07:32.160 --> 07:35.520]  damaged lung tissue and then the viruses are able to live in there
[07:36.000 --> 07:38.000]  so it's it's it's a triple hitter
[07:38.320 --> 07:42.560]  And antibiotics steroids and then of course zinc and things like ivermectin
[07:43.840 --> 07:47.920]  But it's the suppression of that information that is so criminal
[07:50.080 --> 07:54.080]  And that's what allows them to then get these death numbers up to then shut down society
[07:54.080 --> 07:56.720]  And they're engaged in information warfare
[07:57.280 --> 07:59.280]  terrorism so the former fox
[07:59.680 --> 08:02.080]  26 reporter a few weeks ago was at
[08:02.960 --> 08:04.960]  seapack in dalas
[08:04.960 --> 08:07.840]  When she got up on the stage they turned her mic off because fox
[08:08.720 --> 08:10.720]  It turns out was the sponsor
[08:11.600 --> 08:14.080]  And even though that was just an affiliate they shut her down so
[08:14.720 --> 08:19.760]  Disgusting behavior there she'll be in studio the constitutional lawyer robert marns will be on
[08:19.760 --> 08:23.440]  And to talk about the legality of the big announcements i'm about to make
[08:24.560 --> 08:26.080]  And of course
[08:26.080 --> 08:29.200]  What evidence of election fraud has come out? It is quite momentous
[08:29.520 --> 08:32.560]  But there's a lot of media and others distracting into red herrings
[08:33.280 --> 08:37.760]  And so we're going to be looking at all of that with bob barnes and then we have
[08:38.640 --> 08:40.640]  jay dyer hosting the fourth hour
[08:42.160 --> 08:44.160]  I have been doing a lot more
[08:44.160 --> 08:48.160]  commercial free interviews
[08:48.960 --> 08:54.640]  And i'm doing a few of the next few days and i also did one yesterday morning with david eich an hour and 30 minutes commercial free
[08:55.440 --> 08:57.440]  That is going to be
[08:58.000 --> 09:00.000]  That is going to be put out this afternoon
[09:00.560 --> 09:04.240]  And then i'm going to tape several other big interviews that we're going to air in premiere this saturday
[09:04.800 --> 09:07.920]  Because the time is short and i need to spend every moment i have on air
[09:08.560 --> 09:11.840]  Okay, if we could let's go to info wars dot com
[09:11.840 --> 09:13.840]  And we'll put up the big show
[09:14.720 --> 09:17.120]  headline for the broadcast today
[09:18.080 --> 09:21.120]  And this is a pretty big deal and so everybody might want to listen
[09:22.960 --> 09:27.120]  Exclusive biden to announce second nationwide lockdown on august 11th
[09:28.720 --> 09:36.000]  Now i first saw jack posseaubeck who is definitely connected extremely connected to u.s intelligence agencies been in naval intelligence, but
[09:36.000 --> 09:41.600]  Uh, he's definitely hooked in and he said the chatter is they're looking to do it on august 11th
[09:42.080 --> 09:44.080]  I saw that two weeks ago
[09:44.640 --> 09:46.640]  Almost two weeks ago. Then I saw the federal
[09:47.200 --> 09:53.280]  Emergency management agency and the federal communications commission announced that they're going to do an internet takeover drill
[09:54.080 --> 09:58.880]  Uh an eas alert on the 11th, so don't get upset
[09:59.600 --> 10:03.120]  And then you know i'm the type of guy that knows when they're going to do something that big
[10:03.120 --> 10:07.520]  They're going to have radio and tv station owner engineers
[10:08.240 --> 10:12.080]  Do tests before to make sure it also goes out on their platforms
[10:12.480 --> 10:16.560]  Because i've been in radio and tv 27 years. I know how that works made some phone calls
[10:17.200 --> 10:19.200]  last week actually to some engineers
[10:19.440 --> 10:22.560]  And they said indeed they're told that there's something big coming on the 11th
[10:22.880 --> 10:29.440]  Then I talked to some military sources last night and they said yes, uh, they're told biden will make a big announcement on the 11th
[10:29.440 --> 10:36.880]  Uh and be ready to even quell any type of uh insurrection is what they're calling protest
[10:38.160 --> 10:41.840]  So, uh, I can tell you uh that now possobit came out
[10:42.720 --> 10:45.840]  And said from his sources, which possobit's the real deal
[10:46.400 --> 10:50.000]  Uh that the white house is writing the speech right now and it will be on the 11th
[10:50.560 --> 10:54.480]  Uh, so I don't just go off what he says even though he might be credible 100 times
[10:54.480 --> 10:56.480]  Maybe the hundred and first he's wrong
[10:56.480 --> 11:00.000]  Uh, but he's saying it and I made some calls from different angles and confirmed it
[11:00.160 --> 11:03.840]  That they are definitely have that as a marker point that they're probably going to do it
[11:04.080 --> 11:07.680]  Now if we expose it and get ahead of it if governor speak up the senate speaks up
[11:08.240 --> 11:10.400]  Um, then they made back off
[11:11.200 --> 11:13.200]  That's why i'm doing this
[11:13.360 --> 11:19.840]  But you know 95 of the time i'm very very accurate when I make these type of predictions because it's not a prediction
[11:20.880 --> 11:23.200]  Something this big they're going to set the table
[11:23.200 --> 11:27.600]  Like you show up at grandma's house. You smell food. See the table set you go. Oh, wow
[11:28.080 --> 11:31.520]  Because you cook something when I came to visit. I didn't know you're making a big meal
[11:32.160 --> 11:34.800]  And she comes out with a big ham or a turkey. She's like, oh, absolutely
[11:35.040 --> 11:38.000]  I mean you can smell it coming out of the kitchen the tyranny
[11:38.480 --> 11:43.920]  That they got the table all set they got the knives out for us and then you got all the preparatory announcements taking place
[11:43.920 --> 11:51.840]  So yeah, yeah, yeah national lockdown day lockdown to make sure big tech destroys more of the economy consolidates power
[11:51.840 --> 11:57.040]  And they're just going to do it every every late summer into fall
[11:57.120 --> 12:01.840]  This is our new life where your businesses are shut down but amazon and uh
[12:03.040 --> 12:05.040]  Walmart and target they're all open
[12:06.240 --> 12:08.560]  And if people put up with this and they just get what they deserve
[12:09.200 --> 12:11.200]  churches are still closed in canada the
[12:11.440 --> 12:13.440]  Topless bars have been open the whole time
[12:14.000 --> 12:16.160]  So it's just it's just unbelievable
[12:16.160 --> 12:21.520]  Uh, let me let me just give you the headlines here as best I can
[12:22.400 --> 12:25.600]  And and then tell you what that means when he declares this emergency
[12:26.480 --> 12:28.480]  Um, but because he's gonna say
[12:29.040 --> 12:31.040]  And I have this from uh
[12:31.120 --> 12:32.640]  My own deep research
[12:32.640 --> 12:38.480]  Because I know what the club of rome and what the trilateral commission and what the cfr and what the debauch group all the same people
[12:38.800 --> 12:43.120]  What the un say and their white papers will now be announced so I can tell you what's gonna be announced
[12:43.120 --> 12:46.560]  He's also gonna announce a climate emergency on the 11th
[12:47.680 --> 12:51.440]  And tie the two together now they may run in and change to some of the speeches now
[12:52.800 --> 12:56.400]  But only if any senators look into this and challenge them or any governors
[12:56.880 --> 13:00.320]  Uh, they don't care if I come out and tell you beforehand. They think I don't matter
[13:00.400 --> 13:04.720]  They think you don't matter so they'll probably execute it just as I'm saying on the 11th
[13:05.200 --> 13:07.200]  They might move it to the 14th or something or
[13:07.200 --> 13:12.720]  That's another date that they've definitely got a lot of action around but uh, we're talking right now
[13:13.520 --> 13:15.520]  six days
[13:15.520 --> 13:19.760]  From lockdown to being announced and all of the suicide and all the bankruptcy
[13:20.320 --> 13:24.480]  And all the homelessness and and death that comes with it and you've already seen 10 deaths
[13:24.480 --> 13:27.520]  They say from covet this year in seven months in australia
[13:28.480 --> 13:30.480]  And they're under total lockdown basically
[13:30.800 --> 13:35.040]  Uh with the military out beating up men women and children that dare go outside to walk their dog. I mean
[13:35.040 --> 13:40.480]  This is just disgusting. Oh, and I tell you what's even richer. There's an article on info wars.com
[13:41.120 --> 13:43.280]  Uh, well, you guys print for me. It just popped up. Thanks
[13:44.720 --> 13:47.760]  The u.n. Is reporting that governments are bad
[13:48.240 --> 13:52.240]  And governments are attacking their own people and are authoritarian
[13:52.480 --> 13:57.520]  And the u.n. Is very upset about footage out of germany in france in australia and the u.s.
[13:57.600 --> 14:03.520]  And canada of riot police beating men women and children at anti lockdown protests. Oh my goodness
[14:03.520 --> 14:09.200]  Just like the u.n. So upset about all the mass starvation 20 plus million the starve to death the last year and a half
[14:09.840 --> 14:14.160]  Uh with the lockdowns they admit so they order the lockdowns and then they're up
[14:14.240 --> 14:21.120]  They tell you oh about the death and how terrible and then they tell you oh, it's a u.n. Project to censor everybody and control everybody
[14:22.320 --> 14:24.560]  But then when the police beat everyone
[14:25.120 --> 14:27.760]  In lockdowns they order then the police are bad
[14:27.760 --> 14:34.960]  So it's called having cake and eating it too. And I by the way, I'm not defeat but defending these horrible evil north korean style police
[14:35.200 --> 14:37.200]  No matter where they are in los angeles or
[14:38.320 --> 14:43.280]  In in in melbourne australia or in north korea. I'm saying
[14:44.080 --> 14:49.760]  That to have the u.n. Then habits cake and eat it too and go. Oh my god. Look
[14:50.560 --> 14:54.720]  These governments are at war with their own people. This is torture
[14:54.720 --> 14:56.720]  Which of course it is
[14:57.760 --> 15:00.880]  And and it is north korea and it is like off the chart
[15:01.120 --> 15:08.000]  But but the very group that the fortune 100 controls giving the shots like a general a field marshal in a war
[15:08.240 --> 15:15.040]  He says user artillery on that town kill everyone. So for a day and a half artillery blow a town to pieces of 10,000 people
[15:15.920 --> 15:21.280]  And then the field marshal gets on the tv and says it's terrible. What the army did to that town
[15:21.280 --> 15:24.800]  I'm so upset. Oh that army is evil. What?
[15:26.160 --> 15:28.160]  what
[15:28.400 --> 15:30.400]  Feel like a hitler said I apologize
[15:31.840 --> 15:33.840]  for the german military invading
[15:34.800 --> 15:36.320]  north africa
[15:36.320 --> 15:42.080]  1941 I'm good. I'm against it. You ordered it. I mean it's it's the death of logic
[15:42.560 --> 15:46.960]  Because they think the public has no logic. So they just do all this stuff like you got to take this vaccine
[15:46.960 --> 15:50.000]  No, it doesn't protect you and it actually makes you sicker, but you're gonna take it

[17:59.120 --> 18:04.320]  The biosecurity state is here. It's an anti-human eugenics operation
[18:04.720 --> 18:07.520]  Training us that humans are dirty, bad and evil
[18:07.920 --> 18:15.920]  The corrupt puppet prime minister of Canada says he admires the communist dictatorship of G.G. Ping and wishes to make Canada the same
[18:16.160 --> 18:22.480]  Has announced that they're buying vaccines for every person in the country all the way out to 2024
[18:22.800 --> 18:26.000]  And that in 2024 you will again take two shots
[18:26.000 --> 18:29.600]  And he says it'll be whatever fizer cooks up and wants to put in your body
[18:29.840 --> 18:33.920]  This is the Rockefeller Foundation. They developed this whole plan with Bill Gates
[18:34.240 --> 18:39.200]  They're now implementing it and now they've announced that U.S. policy is set by the private Rockefeller Foundation
[18:39.440 --> 18:43.280]  Of course the Rockefeller Foundation by the 30s was the main funder of Adolf
[18:43.520 --> 18:48.800]  Alois Hitler and the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor that trained the Cosworth Ilham Institute in Germany
[18:49.280 --> 18:52.640]  And Volwars will continue to set fast. They fight this. I don't know how long we can
[18:52.640 --> 18:57.520]  The enemy's coming for us all now. God bless and good luck. I would again get right with God right now
[19:01.680 --> 19:06.560]  Jacob and Ohio welcome. Go ahead. Hey, how's it going Alex? Good. Great last caller
[19:06.720 --> 19:13.600]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement. It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting
[19:13.840 --> 19:18.960]  Moralization and absurdity. It's like we're living in a twilight zone and all right. Eric's in New Hampshire
[19:18.960 --> 19:24.480]  Eric, thanks for calling. Go ahead. Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call. If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for the
[19:24.640 --> 19:29.200]  One of the product. Um, the X team does wonders. They recommend it to everybody here on the fence about it
[19:29.360 --> 19:34.880]  Get off the fence get the product support the info or Tyler in Maine. You're on the year. Thanks for holding. Go ahead
[19:35.040 --> 19:42.880]  Hey, Alex, it's great to be on with you. It's an honor honor. Talk to you. Awesome. Uh, so firstly, I wanted to do is say I love the product
[19:43.120 --> 19:46.720]  Alpha power even at 29 if you ask my best friend
[19:46.720 --> 19:52.720]  She loves it. All right. It helps with the bedroom. So just number one for a few hours. It definitely works. It's not a joke. Yeah
[19:53.280 --> 19:55.280]  Absolutely
[19:55.280 --> 20:11.680]  Yeah, absolutely. You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[20:25.280 --> 20:27.280]  Oh
[20:55.520 --> 20:57.520]  Yeah
[21:05.600 --> 21:13.440]  Let me lay it out real easy and real clear what's going on. What's happening. What's unfolding
[21:16.000 --> 21:17.840]  Private banks
[21:17.840 --> 21:22.400]  were able to get control of the currency of the british empire in 1815
[21:22.400 --> 21:26.880]  And once they did that they got control of most of the other currencies on the planet
[21:27.840 --> 21:32.320]  And then we had the breton woods agreement after world war two that agreed to make the dollar the world reserve currency
[21:33.760 --> 21:36.400]  And that benefited americans and others to a great extent
[21:38.480 --> 21:43.440]  But then over time the private bank holders were able to create
[21:44.800 --> 21:46.800]  thousands of trillions of dollars
[21:47.280 --> 21:49.280]  that they used
[21:49.280 --> 21:55.440]  to buy up the media the academics all the major corporations
[21:58.560 --> 22:02.160]  And now they have this huge pile of derivatives
[22:02.960 --> 22:06.800]  That years ago a decade ago was in the multi quadrillions
[22:08.080 --> 22:10.080]  That's a thousand trillion
[22:12.400 --> 22:14.400]  They say now it is
[22:14.400 --> 22:22.640]  Many times worse than that to where they could buy the world over at current inflation rates thousands of times
[22:23.440 --> 22:28.400]  Now that's fraud. You know bernie madoff went to jail for creating 80 billion or so in fake money
[22:28.800 --> 22:31.360]  And he and he ripped off rich people. That's why he went to jail
[22:32.400 --> 22:35.120]  So he was kind of running a scam on the establishment itself
[22:35.760 --> 22:37.760]  That they run on all of us
[22:38.640 --> 22:41.440]  And so what do you do when you come to the end of the line?
[22:41.440 --> 22:46.400]  What do you do when when it gets down to brass tacks now?
[22:47.360 --> 22:51.840]  And they've got this giant global debt that's fraud. They should all go to prison for it
[22:53.280 --> 22:59.280]  But it's infected all the pension funds and all the mortgages and all the governments and all the systems of the world
[22:59.680 --> 23:04.800]  And the chinese are duplicating it in the eu has their own system. And there's all these incestuous
[23:04.800 --> 23:13.120]  Money laundering operations and Ponzi steams going on and then what do you do when you know it's coming to an end and you know
[23:13.120 --> 23:15.120]  You can't hide the inflation
[23:15.360 --> 23:20.800]  Well, you release a virus you hype it up you lock things down you destroy the real economy you tell people hey
[23:20.880 --> 23:22.880]  I'm going to give you a universal income
[23:24.240 --> 23:27.200]  To create a depression in the real economy so there's less goods
[23:27.920 --> 23:34.000]  So that the inflation doesn't show up as bad as it would and then you get control of those individuals
[23:34.000 --> 23:37.920]  who don't understand economics and are now getting a pittance of
[23:39.680 --> 23:41.680]  Money made out of nowhere
[23:41.680 --> 23:47.360]  But then they get behavioral control and political alignment and fielding and submission
[23:47.920 --> 23:55.680]  From those individuals. So this is all a process of having an endless emergency and lockdowns that consolidate power into a handful of globalist big tech
[23:56.160 --> 23:58.160]  corporations
[23:58.160 --> 23:59.200]  While you're shut down
[23:59.200 --> 24:06.720]  But while you learn to go on the dole for fewer and fewer resources because they're going to pay you for many many many many many years
[24:07.680 --> 24:09.840]  More than you would get paid in the free market
[24:10.240 --> 24:17.680]  Only to get rid of what's left of small businesses and mom and pops because once they're gone then they're going to have total control
[24:19.040 --> 24:24.080]  And that's their admitted plan and that's their great reset is you will own nothing you will have nothing
[24:24.400 --> 24:26.800]  You will live in a coffin size
[24:26.800 --> 24:30.720]  Tube this is all official. You will not get meat. You will not travel
[24:31.200 --> 24:33.920]  But you will have all of the synthetic drugs
[24:34.640 --> 24:37.200]  And pornography entertainment you want given to you
[24:38.320 --> 24:40.320]  You will be anesthetized
[24:41.360 --> 24:43.360]  After they've taken everything from you physically
[24:44.240 --> 24:46.240]  They will then take your mind
[24:47.200 --> 24:49.200]  And that's what this is
[24:49.200 --> 24:55.600]  And so the chains are going on right now
[24:59.680 --> 25:05.440]  Your birthright your privacy your own ideas you're right to self-defense you're right to get married and have children
[25:05.760 --> 25:07.760]  All of it is under total assault
[25:08.400 --> 25:11.600]  You're right to religion. It's all under your body. You're right to happen
[25:11.600 --> 25:14.480]  Your body what you want and they didn't just come out with a placebo
[25:14.480 --> 25:18.960]  And then say oh, we'll open back up once you take the placebo. No, they upfront
[25:18.960 --> 25:21.920]  They give you something that gives you blood clots and kills you slowly
[25:23.840 --> 25:29.680]  Because they got to get the party started at a certain point and they know that actually in the twisted psychology and behavioral psychology
[25:30.400 --> 25:36.800]  That actually if something's really abusive and violent and bad and no alpha males come to stop it
[25:37.920 --> 25:43.680]  That people will then subserve themselves to the abusers under what I call mass Stockholm syndrome
[25:43.680 --> 25:45.680]  and learned helplessness
[25:46.560 --> 25:51.680]  And that people will then bow down to the oppression and the domination
[25:53.040 --> 25:57.280]  Because they mentally can't handle the horror of what's being done to them
[25:57.520 --> 26:04.000]  It's too scary to know they've got control of the government and are coming even for children with something that
[26:04.720 --> 26:07.600]  Colonizes your body with prion mad cow crystals
[26:08.240 --> 26:10.240]  on record
[26:10.240 --> 26:12.240]  And so
[26:13.520 --> 26:15.120]  It's so
[26:15.120 --> 26:18.160]  Horrifying to people that up front it's killing so many
[26:18.800 --> 26:24.000]  And when they talk about how they got sick or how their daughter died or how their father died or their mother died or their brother died
[26:24.240 --> 26:26.640]  They get censored it creates desperation
[26:26.640 --> 26:37.600]  And so this is a full-on calling a full-on exercise of power
[26:40.800 --> 26:44.240]  And this is war against humanity it's horrifying
[26:47.200 --> 26:50.640]  So we're already under a martial law where the former president can't be online
[26:51.200 --> 26:54.240]  And millions of other people have been taken offline in the u.s. alone
[26:54.240 --> 27:00.000]  We're already under a martial law where they surveil everything you do and big tech sends out trojan horse
[27:00.800 --> 27:06.480]  Assistant apps that listen and watch your every move and your phones track your every move. We're already under a martial law
[27:08.080 --> 27:11.120]  When they're already announcing and all these big blue cities and states they control
[27:11.680 --> 27:16.080]  Vaccine passports and you can't go to the grocery store all the same thing that you and already announced
[27:16.960 --> 27:20.480]  And the same thing that Boris Johnson and macron all announced
[27:20.480 --> 27:24.320]  But then they're going to make it official coming up very very soon
[27:24.960 --> 27:26.960]  The date they have set is the 11th
[27:27.200 --> 27:34.320]  After all their surrogates and all their minions and all their people called for it and prepared it and got it lined up and got it ready
[27:36.080 --> 27:40.400]  And so you have this sense of helplessness of hey, it's in their white papers. They're going to have a
[27:40.720 --> 27:45.680]  Internet ID. They're going to have a global social credit score based off of this database
[27:45.680 --> 27:50.400]  This medical ID and they say they're going to take three or four shots a year and then even more
[27:51.280 --> 27:56.320]  And they're going to track and control you and then once they have that pass for you to be able to travel
[27:56.400 --> 28:01.200]  They can then not let you travel for a lot of other reasons. So you don't want to take the system
[28:01.200 --> 28:06.640]  It's not a key to the city like the blaseo said yesterday. It's a key to the chains. They control
[28:07.440 --> 28:10.240]  That are on your body that they now throw the key into the ocean
[28:10.240 --> 28:14.960]  When we come back, I'll go over all these articles, but it's all totally predictable. How did I say over a year ago?
[28:15.280 --> 28:17.840]  Hell, I said it in March. I've had the clip many times
[28:18.960 --> 28:21.840]  That was working out a lot more than I was 20 pounds lighter and have wearing that
[28:22.400 --> 28:24.640]  Wearing that, you know, brown light brown suit
[28:25.520 --> 28:27.520]  And I'm up here in March and I say
[28:28.800 --> 28:32.000]  They're going to make you take the shots to the claim there's a new variant
[28:32.480 --> 28:34.960]  And that the vaccine didn't work and then it's the unvaccinated
[28:34.960 --> 28:40.320]  They're to blame and they'll do it by the end of the summer 2021 because we had the documents
[28:40.720 --> 28:42.720]  That's a u.m document. I didn't predict that
[28:43.520 --> 28:45.520]  It's a battle plan
[28:45.200 --> 28:49.920]  And there's nothing more frustrating than having an enemy's battle plan and having it and and and not seeing
[28:50.960 --> 28:52.960]  Resistance mount to a criminal takeover
[28:54.960 --> 28:59.680]  Hey, everybody confused about staying healthy in a crazy covid culture me too
[28:59.680 --> 29:04.440]  Hey everybody, confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture?
[29:04.440 --> 29:05.440]  Me too.
[29:05.440 --> 29:09.600]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling,
[29:09.600 --> 29:12.360]  there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[29:12.360 --> 29:16.720]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[29:16.720 --> 29:18.440]  You probably already believe that.
[29:18.440 --> 29:19.640]  I certainly do.
[29:19.640 --> 29:20.640]  So here's the thing.
[29:20.640 --> 29:25.000]  I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances actually
[29:25.000 --> 29:29.080]  have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[29:29.080 --> 29:34.840]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at StrongerDefense.com.
[29:34.840 --> 29:36.280]  No cures or treatments there.
[29:36.280 --> 29:41.360]  Instead, little-known but shocking immune system research and a breakthrough immune support
[29:41.360 --> 29:45.400]  product based on that research called Immune 10x.

[29:59.040 --> 30:05.200]  So what's the most important part, let's say, in a bulldozer running over the globalist?
[30:05.200 --> 30:09.720]  The treads, the wheels, the engine, the scoop on the front, it's all very important, but
[30:09.720 --> 30:13.560]  the fuel is paramount, and that's my allegory.
[30:13.560 --> 30:18.320]  Turboforce is vitamins, minerals, amino acids that synergistically work with six different
[30:18.320 --> 30:22.760]  natural forms of healthy clean energy that last for 10 hours in the average metabolic
[30:22.760 --> 30:24.520]  system metabolism of a human.
[30:24.520 --> 30:27.360]  Some people get 15 hours out of this, some people get about 8 hours, but people take
[30:27.360 --> 30:30.440]  this, people are taking it in sports, people cannot believe it's the best they've ever
[30:30.440 --> 30:32.480]  had because it's not high.
[30:32.480 --> 30:37.840]  Nobody puts as much product into their pre-workouts, their post-workouts, you can call us whatever
[30:37.840 --> 30:38.840]  you want.
[30:38.840 --> 30:41.680]  It's a total solution, all around the best you're going to find.
[30:41.680 --> 30:44.720]  Turboforce, without you, we don't roll.
[30:44.720 --> 30:46.440]  With you, we search forward together.
[30:46.440 --> 30:48.400]  It's like the bulldozer without the diesel fuel.
[30:48.400 --> 30:51.040]  If we don't have your financial support, we will be defeated.
[30:51.040 --> 30:53.720]  You support us to get products you already need that literally fuel your body and your
[30:53.720 --> 30:54.720]  mind?
[30:54.720 --> 31:00.440]  You can win 360 together in FullWarStore.com or AAA-253-3139.

[32:00.760 --> 32:06.640]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021 and I just want to say something.
[32:06.640 --> 32:11.000]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over
[32:11.000 --> 32:15.320]  the years and has truly been answered a prayer and I am so blessed and thankful for all of
[32:15.320 --> 32:16.320]  you, the listeners of this show.
[32:16.320 --> 32:20.880]  I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you, whether you are old, whether you are
[32:20.880 --> 32:24.720]  Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter you got red blood and if you love freedom
[32:24.720 --> 32:30.000]  and justice and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters together
[32:30.000 --> 32:34.840]  and it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the years and as crazy
[32:34.840 --> 32:37.720]  your things are, I want to keep working into the future.
[32:37.720 --> 32:41.200]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[32:41.200 --> 32:46.480]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[32:46.480 --> 32:48.600]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[32:48.600 --> 32:52.200]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've
[32:52.200 --> 32:57.720]  done and just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you and hopefully
[32:57.720 --> 33:00.080]  God will touch your heart to continue to support Him for the worse.
[33:00.080 --> 33:28.560]  Thank you and God bless.
[33:30.080 --> 33:46.520]  But it wasn't because I didn't know enough, I knew too much, but now it's here to the
[33:46.520 --> 33:55.360]  part of the story where it's going to be right out in the oven and you'll be really crazy
[33:55.360 --> 33:56.840]  if you don't stand up and say no.
[33:56.840 --> 34:03.320]  It's the moment you figure out that submission is death, resistance is life.
[34:03.320 --> 34:08.960]  Let me give you an illustration before I hit the tyranny and what Joe Biden is set to announce
[34:08.960 --> 34:12.040]  on August 11th.
[34:12.040 --> 34:14.520]  It's confirmed.
[34:14.520 --> 34:17.840]  You're hearing in here, confirmed first, they're set to make that day.
[34:17.840 --> 34:21.280]  They may change the date of the announcement, but it's on and all their surrogates are saying
[34:21.280 --> 34:22.280]  it's on.
[34:22.280 --> 34:25.840]  Hell, I knew this over a week ago, but I wanted to make dead shirt.
[34:25.840 --> 34:31.840]  It's coming up in a moment, but I got several articles that tie together that illustrate
[34:31.840 --> 34:33.840]  the layout of this.
[34:33.840 --> 34:37.120]  Let me show you these articles.
[34:37.120 --> 34:39.680]  This came out again a few days ago, zero hedge.com.
[34:39.680 --> 34:43.760]  Build is the biggest newspaper magazine in Europe.
[34:43.760 --> 34:49.760]  Very respected editor in chief of Europe's top newspaper apologizes for fear driven coverage
[34:49.760 --> 34:54.480]  of COVID and says the police are beating men, women and children.
[34:54.480 --> 34:55.480]  This is all overblown.
[34:55.480 --> 34:57.800]  The numbers were much exaggerated.
[34:57.800 --> 34:59.760]  The PCR test are fake.
[34:59.760 --> 35:01.080]  We apologize.
[35:01.080 --> 35:02.400]  We were wrong.
[35:02.400 --> 35:05.920]  Now, is that because people are turned against him?
[35:05.920 --> 35:08.800]  Maybe it's because his wife's going to leave him, maybe because he has a soul.
[35:08.800 --> 35:10.200]  I don't know.
[35:10.200 --> 35:16.160]  But it's that type of activity of people that are in the system.
[35:16.160 --> 35:20.800]  I mean, build at the end of World War II, the OSS came in, took it over and made it the
[35:20.800 --> 35:26.640]  new paper, then the CIA ran it forever, everybody knows that.
[35:26.640 --> 35:30.360]  You can argue whether the Germans ever really got control of it, but the point is, build
[35:30.360 --> 35:32.800]  is the mouth of the establishment.
[35:32.800 --> 35:34.200]  Why would it be saying that?
[35:34.200 --> 35:36.440]  Because people rebel inside the establishment?
[35:36.440 --> 35:37.440]  I don't know.
[35:37.440 --> 35:40.280]  But I'm telling you this, this is bad for everybody.
[35:40.280 --> 35:42.200]  I don't care if you're the editor of build.
[35:42.200 --> 35:43.480]  I don't care who you are.
[35:43.480 --> 35:47.680]  We're destroying civilization.
[35:47.680 --> 35:54.160]  So the globalist can consolidate power over what?
[35:54.160 --> 35:57.640]  Save the Earth collapsing civilization and the giant wars.
[35:57.640 --> 35:58.640]  That's going to start.
[35:58.640 --> 36:00.880]  No, this is about power and control.
[36:00.880 --> 36:02.480]  This is not about the environment.
[36:02.480 --> 36:06.480]  They tell their acolytes, oh, we're taking over and starving everyone for the Earth.
[36:06.480 --> 36:15.760]  Oh, we're consolidating power and bankrupting people for to cut the carbon, bullshit.
[36:15.760 --> 36:19.560]  People BS.
[36:19.560 --> 36:21.160]  So this is what you want to see.
[36:21.160 --> 36:22.160]  You want to see this.
[36:22.160 --> 36:23.160]  This is a featured video.
[36:23.160 --> 36:26.320]  I didn't watch this when it was live here, stay in the fourth hour.
[36:26.320 --> 36:31.520]  I watched it last night, but I got home after work at 930.
[36:31.520 --> 36:32.520]  Not bitching.
[36:32.520 --> 36:33.520]  I'm just working hard.
[36:33.520 --> 36:39.600]  And look at this bombshell, high level Pfizer whistleblower confirms COVID injections
[36:39.600 --> 36:41.320]  are poisonous bio weapons.
[36:41.320 --> 36:45.720]  She was on with a psychiatrist, Dr. Andrew Kaufman did a great job in the fourth hour.
[36:45.720 --> 36:49.840]  And then she just goes over the patents that they admit it is designed to get blood clots
[36:49.840 --> 36:53.800]  and kill you.
[36:53.800 --> 36:56.320]  That is the whole point.
[36:56.320 --> 36:59.680]  That's Karen Kingston.
[36:59.680 --> 37:06.920]  So it's going to be people like the editor-in-chief of Germany's bill apologizing and saying this
[37:06.920 --> 37:12.880]  is wrong and that this is tyranny and that the police attacking everybody is evil and
[37:12.880 --> 37:17.720]  forgive us for generations, you know, we have we have helped induct everyone into total
[37:17.720 --> 37:21.760]  tyranny.
[37:21.760 --> 37:30.400]  It's going to be people like that, like Julian Reichlitz, if I'm saying that right.
[37:30.400 --> 37:40.080]  And Karen Kingston, people have got to decide to say no at a certain point and stop surrendering
[37:40.080 --> 37:41.080]  to evil.
[37:41.080 --> 37:45.560]  Because as Thomas Jefferson was famously asked, what is the level of tyranny at which tyrants
[37:45.560 --> 37:46.560]  will stop?
[37:46.560 --> 37:53.160]  And he said at the level you start pushing back, there is no level.
[37:53.160 --> 37:55.680]  It's not it's well thought out how they're doing it.
[37:55.680 --> 38:01.120]  It's a technocracy, but it's it's what they're in game is insane and will not work.
[38:01.120 --> 38:04.560]  It's why they say, oh, we're destroying civilization to save the earth because they know their
[38:04.560 --> 38:06.600]  program is just a destruction.
[38:06.600 --> 38:08.720]  And the people on top know that's the plan.
[38:08.720 --> 38:09.720]  Pure evil.
[38:09.720 --> 38:14.680]  Those below believe they're really doing all this creative destruction, Chicago Business
[38:14.680 --> 38:21.680]  School Rockefeller crap because it's for the greater good because they're the drawn down
[38:21.680 --> 38:24.640]  fraud liberals and they're they're fighting the establishment.
[38:24.640 --> 38:25.640]  Yeah, right.
[38:25.640 --> 38:29.680]  You are the establishment, people that serve the system.
[38:29.680 --> 38:33.240]  So let's let's let's talk about reality here.
[38:33.240 --> 38:35.240]  Look at this.
[38:35.240 --> 38:44.720]  Tucker Carlson comes out last night and points out the elephant in the room and even the
[38:44.720 --> 38:46.880]  Washington Post gets it opinion.
[38:46.880 --> 38:53.600]  The CDC's eviction moratorium is almost certainly illegal.
[38:53.600 --> 39:02.680]  So even the Washington Post Jeff Bezos's publication says you just can't have the CDC because the
[39:02.680 --> 39:10.840]  CDC let me explain this doesn't have the statutory power in any way to announce that for now
[39:10.840 --> 39:16.520]  over a year and a half people's mortgages are forgiven or their rents are forgiven.
[39:16.520 --> 39:20.600]  And again, why would the system be doing that because they're going to knock out the smaller
[39:20.600 --> 39:26.760]  renters and the smaller property owners and consolidate that they're just creating disorder
[39:26.760 --> 39:31.160]  and fear.
[39:31.160 --> 39:35.120]  And of course, was it constitutional to say all these small businesses were not essential
[39:35.120 --> 39:40.640]  to begin the breakdown and tell people stay home so that the economy would fall apart.
[39:40.640 --> 39:42.320]  So production would drop.
[39:42.320 --> 39:45.200]  No, all of it was wrong.
[39:45.200 --> 39:52.800]  And then where is the CDC coming out and saying, oh, we order everyone to keep giving everybody
[39:52.800 --> 39:56.720]  free rent, even though the people that are paying property taxes on those houses and
[39:56.720 --> 40:01.280]  apartments and condos and that are fixing the roof and fixing the air conditioner and
[40:01.280 --> 40:06.920]  fixing the pipes and fixing everything when the renters are cooking meth in the living
[40:06.920 --> 40:13.120]  room or the kitchen, they've got to still pay the banks who are the big boys.
[40:13.120 --> 40:18.640]  So this is savage war by the ruling class against everyone.
[40:18.640 --> 40:21.460]  And you see the ruling class doubling and tripling profits.
[40:21.460 --> 40:29.320]  So of course, a year later, they're back with lockdown too.
[40:29.320 --> 40:31.560]  So the question is, when do you come up for air?
[40:31.560 --> 40:32.880]  I scanned over this.
[40:32.880 --> 40:37.200]  Here's the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Department of Health, Human Services,
[40:37.200 --> 40:42.080]  Order, Section 361, Public Health Service Act.
[40:42.080 --> 40:45.680]  Since when do they have the power, they tell you how they have the power, they don't have
[40:45.680 --> 40:54.040]  it, to declare under civil emergency that they can do this?
[40:54.040 --> 40:58.640]  Well, only if we're under martial law, only if Biden is a dictator, only if all those
[40:58.640 --> 41:04.600]  executive orders have been implemented and you see they haven't been officially implemented.
[41:04.600 --> 41:05.600]  Not all of them yet.
[41:05.600 --> 41:11.920]  And that's what's going to start on January of next year, in my view, is the country going
[41:11.920 --> 41:14.920]  into complete bankruptcy and receivership and collapse.
[41:14.920 --> 41:20.880]  But before then, they want to kill the economy again, put it into cardiac arrest on August
[41:20.880 --> 41:27.320]  11th, with this new declaration, where he'll also declare war on fossil fuels and on business
[41:27.320 --> 41:32.920]  in America to drive anybody else that thought they could invest here out so the globalists
[41:32.920 --> 41:36.880]  can break us, bankrupt us, and then totally consolidate control.
[41:36.880 --> 41:40.320]  But it's not just the money and the houses and the land they want.
[41:40.320 --> 41:42.400]  They want that control over your family.
[41:42.400 --> 41:44.000]  They want that control over your mind.
[41:44.000 --> 41:47.440]  They want that control over everything you do and where you go and they want to be able
[41:47.440 --> 41:50.400]  to watch you because they crave it.
[41:50.400 --> 41:55.640]  And how anybody would give monsters like this this control over their lives and think, oh,
[41:55.640 --> 41:56.640]  just take the shot.
[41:56.640 --> 42:01.080]  You'll get your freedom pass when you'll never, the freedom passes a slave pass, the freedom
[42:01.080 --> 42:10.520]  pass, the key to New York, having this tracker thing on your phone is your ticket to hell.
[42:10.520 --> 42:20.240]  It's your ticket to North Korea and everybody that's got a brain knows that.
[42:20.240 --> 42:24.000]  So the UN pushes the lockdown and says, oh my God, people are starving, you don't give
[42:24.000 --> 42:25.000]  us more money.
[42:25.000 --> 42:28.640]  The UN pushes the torture and beating of people to go outside and says, oh my God, your countries
[42:28.640 --> 42:29.640]  are bad.
[42:29.640 --> 42:30.640]  The UN should take over.
[42:30.640 --> 42:31.640]  Your police are beating you.
[42:31.640 --> 42:37.360]  And they order the lockdown, bankrupt everybody, including the renters and the renters, and
[42:37.360 --> 42:42.480]  then they come in and say, oh, don't worry, we've got a new emergency reorganization where
[42:42.480 --> 42:46.760]  you just sign on to this program and we'll give you money to keep the people living in
[42:46.760 --> 42:47.840]  your house there.
[42:47.840 --> 42:51.840]  So now the government, the big corporations, the banks are the direct controller and then
[42:51.840 --> 42:55.360]  you're just a tenant that kind of manages the property for them.
[42:55.360 --> 42:56.920]  They've got it all figured out.
[42:56.920 --> 42:57.920]  It's all been announced.
[42:57.920 --> 42:59.960]  It's totally diabolical.
[42:59.960 --> 43:04.680]  It was our number two best-selling product until the ongoing COVID lockdowns destroyed
[43:04.680 --> 43:08.960]  the supply chain and it's been six months since we had bodies, our ultimate turmeric
[43:08.960 --> 43:09.960]  formula.
[43:09.960 --> 43:12.480]  And what's been holding up the last few months is the bottle cap.
[43:12.480 --> 43:13.480]  That's why this one's white.
[43:13.480 --> 43:15.720]  I said, I don't care if the cap doesn't match.
[43:15.720 --> 43:16.720]  Get it packaged.

[44:00.280 --> 44:04.080]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[44:04.080 --> 44:07.920]  I've been on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that.
[44:07.920 --> 44:11.120]  But let me tell you, the new world orders breathe them down our neck.
[44:11.120 --> 44:14.200]  The big globalist publications are coming after us and they're doing everything they
[44:14.200 --> 44:15.520]  can to shut us down.
[44:15.520 --> 44:19.840]  So please pray to keep info wars on the air and please support the local station you're

[44:33.320 --> 44:35.440]  I need your help more than ever now.
[44:35.440 --> 44:39.760]  I want to keep fighting the globalist, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[44:39.760 --> 44:44.760]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can, and buy

[47:00.840 --> 47:07.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:30.840 --> 47:42.640]  The human implementation of Christianity has been very flawed, but in Christianity we
[47:42.640 --> 47:48.360]  developed a civilizational system that really empowered humanity and really took us to
[47:48.360 --> 47:50.520]  the next level.
[47:50.520 --> 47:56.440]  But the entire natural world is about the survival of the fittest and it is a system
[47:56.440 --> 48:02.000]  of control and it is seeking to take over and to dominate and to kill again.
[48:02.000 --> 48:07.280]  And notice it creates a system where it doesn't want competition for its prey, wants to dumb
[48:07.280 --> 48:16.000]  us down, isolate us and then take its time toying with us before we're destroyed.
[48:16.000 --> 48:20.240]  So the very survival of the fittest system the globalists talk about is a fraud.
[48:20.240 --> 48:21.240]  They want a monopoly.
[48:21.240 --> 48:25.200]  They want a system where they've got all the weapons, they've got all the technology,
[48:25.200 --> 48:29.720]  they've got all the understanding and then we are just these play things that they ritualistically
[48:29.720 --> 48:32.220]  attack.
[48:32.220 --> 48:36.160]  But if we have a level playing field or even half a level playing field, we will intellectually
[48:36.160 --> 48:38.720]  defeat them.
[48:38.720 --> 48:44.840]  The public will resonate with us, with strong families and strong ideas and God and justice
[48:44.840 --> 48:47.920]  and freedom and real competition.
[48:47.920 --> 48:54.080]  And we will celebrate that competition together and we will raise everyone up in that excellence.
[48:54.080 --> 48:56.560]  They don't want that.
[48:56.560 --> 48:58.380]  They want control of the human.
[48:58.380 --> 49:01.000]  They want the control of the immune system.
[49:01.000 --> 49:03.240]  They want control over our lives.
[49:03.240 --> 49:05.020]  They want to play God.
[49:05.020 --> 49:09.400]  That is what makes them feel powerful is to put a thumb on each and every one of you out
[49:09.400 --> 49:10.400]  there.
[49:10.400 --> 49:14.800]  And they've lied to you about every facet of the COVID takeover and we have their documents
[49:14.800 --> 49:16.160]  that it's about power and control.
[49:16.160 --> 49:17.800]  We have their documents that it's about lockstep.
[49:17.800 --> 49:19.920]  I mean, we know what this is.
[49:19.920 --> 49:22.560]  This is their big grand assault.
[49:22.560 --> 49:25.360]  This is them playing their hand.
[49:25.360 --> 49:28.160]  And they've gotten away with a lot, but it's falling apart quick.
[49:28.160 --> 49:29.960]  It's not going as well as they wanted.
[49:29.960 --> 49:35.320]  They're really scared.
[49:35.320 --> 49:38.280]  I force vaccinations on my cattle.
[49:38.280 --> 49:40.840]  Not because I'm concerned with their health and safety, but because I'm concerned about
[49:40.840 --> 49:44.520]  my profitability.
[49:44.520 --> 49:46.600]  Let's go ahead and look at this.
[49:46.600 --> 49:47.600]  Here we go.
[49:47.600 --> 49:48.920]  Fauci fears variant.
[49:48.920 --> 49:49.920]  He fears.
[49:49.920 --> 49:50.920]  Oh, my gosh.
[49:50.920 --> 49:52.640]  Well, this is not for Domus.
[49:52.640 --> 49:53.640]  It's never right.
[49:53.640 --> 49:54.640]  Is he?
[49:54.640 --> 49:55.640]  He said about his pocketbook.
[49:55.640 --> 50:01.560]  Fauci fears variant worse than Delta is on the horizon because of unvaccinated Americans.
[50:01.560 --> 50:02.560]  That's right.
[50:02.560 --> 50:04.680]  No proofs there, but oh, there's one even worse.
[50:04.680 --> 50:06.160]  See what happened here.
[50:06.160 --> 50:07.560]  They rolled out Delta.
[50:07.560 --> 50:08.760]  All this made up fear.
[50:08.760 --> 50:12.240]  Then we learned the majority of people that were sick had the vaccine.
[50:12.240 --> 50:13.640]  Majority dying had the vaccine.
[50:13.640 --> 50:16.000]  So now we know that Delta is tied to the vaccine.
[50:16.000 --> 50:19.480]  So let's move on to something more scary sounding.
[50:19.480 --> 50:26.400]  Oh, not the real bubonic plague and Nevada and Colorado killing people.
[50:26.400 --> 50:27.400]  No, no, no.
[50:27.400 --> 50:28.400]  That doesn't hit the news.
[50:28.400 --> 50:29.480]  No, no, no.
[50:29.480 --> 50:35.480]  The unvaccinated and it's a voodoo-esque statement.
[50:35.480 --> 50:38.240]  It's not based on reality, but they don't care.
[50:38.240 --> 50:41.600]  Hey, there's a new, even more deadly one coming.
[50:41.600 --> 50:46.280]  And then meanwhile, there were really not any new numbers of people in the hospitals
[50:46.280 --> 50:50.360]  last year, other of those they were killing with ventilators, but this, this year, there
[50:50.360 --> 50:53.320]  are more people sick and there are people getting ill.
[50:53.320 --> 50:55.800]  And now when people get a flu or get a cold, they just panic.
[50:55.800 --> 51:01.120]  They think it's the end of the world because the 19 was a new virus.
[51:01.120 --> 51:05.440]  They cooked up a Chimera so they could own it and control it and control the vaccines
[51:05.440 --> 51:06.640]  and response to it.
[51:06.640 --> 51:12.360]  So they'd be years ahead of everybody else because the vaccine was actually the poison,
[51:12.360 --> 51:13.360]  the spike protein.
[51:13.360 --> 51:19.280]  So here's Fauci blaming you, ladies and gentlemen, those that won't take their experimental shot.
[51:19.280 --> 51:21.480]  How outrageous.
[51:21.480 --> 51:26.040]  Secretary of Defense Austin to announce mandatory vaccine policy for all active duty military
[51:26.040 --> 51:27.720]  and experimental shot.
[51:27.720 --> 51:31.520]  Courts ruled in the early nineties and 2000s, they couldn't do that.
[51:31.520 --> 51:35.160]  But now they're just going to try it again because the majority of the military didn't
[51:35.160 --> 51:36.160]  take it.
[51:36.160 --> 51:37.160]  Oh, they claim 60% dead.
[51:37.160 --> 51:39.680]  That's not true.
[51:39.680 --> 51:46.960]  New York City launches vaccine passport, told you that was coming, totally illegal.
[51:46.960 --> 51:54.400]  The Atlantic, that's the mouth of Obama, unvaccinated people, belong on a no fly list.
[51:54.400 --> 51:59.560]  And you read the headline by the guy that used to work in an Israeli torture prison,
[51:59.560 --> 52:00.560]  Jeffrey Goldberg.
[52:00.560 --> 52:03.800]  He's come down here to visit me before.
[52:03.800 --> 52:08.560]  But really what they want is an ID, he says, we need to roll out now an ID when you travel
[52:08.560 --> 52:13.680]  to get on planes that says your your vaccination status, get assignment of vaccine, every part
[52:13.680 --> 52:14.680]  of it's a lie.
[52:14.680 --> 52:18.640]  And we should have this database that forms, you know, this database that controls everybody.
[52:18.640 --> 52:24.000]  So it's about a database and a tracker ID where they can approve or unapproved you to
[52:24.000 --> 52:28.480]  travel when they want based on social credit, criticizing the globalist, whatever the case
[52:28.480 --> 52:31.680]  may be.
[52:31.680 --> 52:37.080]  And then here's Jeffrey Goldberg, who lied about WMDs, he's credited to being the main
[52:37.080 --> 52:39.120]  guy that made up that stuff.
[52:39.120 --> 52:42.640]  And he worked at an Israeli torture base.
[52:42.640 --> 52:47.560]  And now he's here to put a chain around our neck and a ball and chain and make us take
[52:47.560 --> 52:48.560]  his ID.
[52:48.560 --> 52:51.560]  It's all right here in the article.
[52:51.560 --> 52:55.680]  And that's what Biden's set to announce.
[52:55.680 --> 52:56.680]  You gotta go read the article.
[52:56.680 --> 53:01.600]  It's really disgusting and it reads like 1984 because that's what it is.
[53:01.600 --> 53:07.480]  Oh, but the 7,000 illegals of McCallan released alone who tested positive for COVID.
[53:07.480 --> 53:08.480]  That's okay though.
[53:08.480 --> 53:10.880]  Oh, you test positive, we just dump you on the street.
[53:10.880 --> 53:17.200]  But oh my gosh, you can't let citizens fly on airplanes that aren't in our database.
[53:17.200 --> 53:20.600]  What a creepy evil man, but he's just the mouth of these people.
[53:20.600 --> 53:25.160]  US plans to require COVID-19 shots for foreign travelers, AP reports.
[53:25.160 --> 53:27.560]  So Biden's about to announce that today or tomorrow.
[53:27.560 --> 53:30.640]  And then next, it's just you always hear about new restrictions, new restrictions, which
[53:30.640 --> 53:32.080]  kind of becomes a background noise.
[53:32.080 --> 53:34.920]  It's all behavioral psychologists running this.
[53:34.920 --> 53:38.320]  See, there you go.
[53:38.320 --> 53:43.680]  But Boston Mayor Kim Janney, it's it right, compares vaccine passports to slave papers,
[53:43.680 --> 53:44.680]  birtherism.
[53:44.680 --> 53:49.420]  Well, yeah, I mean, you can't have illegal aliens have IDs, you can't have IDs to vote.
[53:49.420 --> 53:54.600]  But you gotta have them to get on a plane or a train or any of that.
[53:54.600 --> 53:59.160]  LA will consider requiring vaccine proof at restaurants, gyms, indoor sporting events.
[53:59.160 --> 54:03.280]  Everything you already see in Europe, then goes to New York, then goes to California.
[54:03.280 --> 54:05.120]  They just add more and more to see what they get away with.
[54:05.120 --> 54:09.760]  And then have police come by with the health department and shut down your business because
[54:09.760 --> 54:10.760]  they ordered you shut.
[54:10.760 --> 54:15.160]  Even though they don't have that power statutorily, just like they don't have the power to say,
[54:15.160 --> 54:21.600]  oh, after a year and a half of you don't have to pay your rent, the CDC says you still don't
[54:21.600 --> 54:22.600]  have to.
[54:22.600 --> 54:23.600]  They don't have that power.
[54:23.600 --> 54:27.600]  But see, there goes your private property with all the millennials who want their free
[54:27.600 --> 54:30.360]  tuition, their free car, their free everything.
[54:30.360 --> 54:33.960]  They don't get their being inducted into slavery.
[54:33.960 --> 54:36.480]  All color of law.
[54:36.480 --> 54:41.120]  And remember, it's all unauthorized.
[54:41.120 --> 54:46.520]  It's all not even FDA approved because it would have been studied under law and had
[54:46.520 --> 54:47.520]  to have some background.
[54:47.520 --> 54:51.600]  But even now we do know they studied it beforehand, secretly, and they knew exactly what they
[54:51.600 --> 54:53.840]  were doing, killing us.
[54:53.840 --> 55:00.360]  Meanwhile, Baylor professor says it should be a hate crime to criticize Fauci other scientists
[55:00.360 --> 55:03.760]  once people are rested to criticize official science.
[55:03.760 --> 55:07.120]  That is the definition of murdering science right there.
[55:07.120 --> 55:15.360]  Dr. Drew says vaccine passports are new form of segregation, absolutely.
[55:15.360 --> 55:19.920]  The King Obama, though, is scaling back his lavish Martin's Vineyard party after the
[55:19.920 --> 55:23.960]  Communist Chinese criticized him.
[55:23.960 --> 55:28.400]  One rule for us, Google co-founder allowed to enter country with closed borders while
[55:28.400 --> 55:33.160]  others including citizens were blocked New Zealand, let him bring his 12-year-old for
[55:33.160 --> 55:39.200]  medical treatment from his private Fiji Island on his private jet because he is a ruler
[55:39.200 --> 55:40.840]  of the earth.
[55:40.840 --> 55:47.520]  AOC's got caught not wearing a mask but saying let's do our photo shoot, put your mask on
[55:47.520 --> 55:50.960]  because they're all part of the ruling minion class so they all know it's a fraud, it's
[55:50.960 --> 55:51.960]  also funny.
[55:51.960 --> 55:57.520]  I'm going to go to break, I want to encourage listeners to support the broadcast and tell
[55:57.520 --> 55:59.880]  friends and family about it while you still can.
[55:59.880 --> 56:05.160]  People are really receptive to the truth right now, my friends.
[56:05.160 --> 56:11.040]  And so I just want to encourage all the Liskers to know that we have a big special that is
[56:11.040 --> 56:15.320]  going right now.
[56:15.320 --> 56:21.120]  Turbo wars, limited supply, flash sale, say 50% off these top products before they are
[56:21.120 --> 56:23.240]  gone.
[56:23.240 --> 56:28.960]  And that's body's ultimate turmeric formula for a limited time, 50% off because it is
[56:28.960 --> 56:30.280]  selling out.
[56:30.280 --> 56:33.720]  Turbo force, ten hour clean energy, 50% off, limited supply, it's only going for a few
[56:33.720 --> 56:34.720]  more days.
[56:34.720 --> 56:40.440]  Lung cleanse and throat defense, 50% off, limited supply, that's going to run for a week.
[56:40.440 --> 56:47.320]  C and vitamin zinc or zinc, vitamin C and zinc together, 50% off, limited supply at
[56:47.320 --> 56:51.680]  infowarstore.com, that will run for another week.
[56:51.680 --> 56:55.800]  And survival shield X tube had been 40% off.
[56:55.800 --> 56:58.480]  It's very close to selling out.
[56:58.480 --> 57:04.080]  I'm boosting that back to 50% off for just three days as well and all of the info wars
[57:04.080 --> 57:09.160]  privacy pouches to the contact tracers and big tech don't trace everywhere you go because
[57:09.160 --> 57:10.760]  they're dirty criminals.
[57:10.760 --> 57:12.960]  You don't want criminals knowing what you're doing, you want to lock your door at night
[57:12.960 --> 57:15.680]  but also lock up your phone.
[57:15.680 --> 57:20.000]  That's 50% off, you get 10 of the new stickers like a rest voucher, rest gates and all the
[57:20.000 --> 57:25.440]  rest of it, info wars.com and then you also get the big door sticker that explains contact
[57:25.440 --> 57:28.840]  tracers, get the hell off my porch, burn in hell.
[57:28.840 --> 57:29.840]  It says it nicer than that.
[57:29.840 --> 57:37.080]  So 11 stickers and the privacy pouch for $14.95, that's 50% off, that sales is going to end
[57:37.080 --> 57:41.080]  early next week as well, I want to thank you all for your support, get a t-shirt while
[57:41.080 --> 57:46.000]  you're at it at infowarstore.com, like save the frogs and more, we'll be right back.
[57:46.000 --> 57:55.240]  It is through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies
[57:55.240 --> 57:56.240]  we are told.
[57:56.240 --> 58:01.640]  And the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses, which is why fluoridated
[58:01.640 --> 58:04.160]  water is a big problem.
[58:04.160 --> 58:09.280]  Using too much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland and shuts down its
[58:09.280 --> 58:13.880]  natural functions, natural functions which have been known for millennia.
[58:13.880 --> 58:18.040]  The Hindu chakras align with the endocrine system, the chakra aligned with the pineal
[58:18.040 --> 58:20.360]  gland is the third eye.
[58:20.360 --> 58:25.240]  Also described as the seat of the soul, the pineal gland is what connects us to higher
[58:25.240 --> 58:30.640]  levels of consciousness and otherwise unseen dimensions of reality.
[58:30.640 --> 58:36.200]  Fluoride free water is essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy, our water filtration
[58:36.200 --> 58:41.600]  systems with the proper filters will keep your drinking water fluoride free and the
[58:41.600 --> 59:11.560]  appropriate shower head will seal the deal.
[59:11.560 --> 59:12.560]  Well guess what?
[59:12.560 --> 59:20.360]  It was Anthony Fauci, a eugenicist's globalist that ran the rollout of HIV and the mistreatment
[59:20.360 --> 59:24.480]  of it with AZT and other chemicals that actually killed more people than HIV and they were
[59:24.480 --> 59:29.960]  the ones involved in viral research of viruses that would actually go attack the teen lymphocytes
[59:29.960 --> 59:33.120]  of the body and create autoimmune disorders.
[59:33.120 --> 59:38.480]  The problem for them was the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down
[59:38.480 --> 59:39.480]  the road.
[59:39.480 --> 59:43.520]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine because now they admit the
[59:43.520 --> 59:48.840]  COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system, basically giving you the equivalent of HIV.
[59:48.840 --> 59:53.640]  That's right ladies and gentlemen.
[59:53.640 --> 59:57.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:57.920 --> 1:00:14.920]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[1:00:14.920 --> 1:00:29.200]  Infowars has been banned, arrested, attacked and threatened because we are effective.
[1:00:29.200 --> 1:00:31.120]  The great awakening is here.
[1:00:31.120 --> 1:00:44.880]  Go to banned.video, download the videos and share, support the information war at infowarstore.com
[1:00:44.880 --> 1:01:00.120]  and never give up the fight.
[1:01:00.120 --> 1:01:05.120]  Guess who's criticising Australia for imposing one of the most brutal lockdowns in the developed
[1:01:05.120 --> 1:01:06.120]  world.
[1:01:06.120 --> 1:01:10.640]  Piers Corbyn, Amnesty International, Human Rights Campaigners, no.
[1:01:10.640 --> 1:01:15.640]  It's literally the communist Chinese government, the Global Times, the official mouthpiece
[1:01:15.640 --> 1:01:21.080]  for the CCP, published a scathing editorial describing Australia's decision to send members
[1:01:21.080 --> 1:01:27.360]  of the military to occupy Sydney and enforce lockdown as a move that seemed, quote, draconian
[1:01:27.360 --> 1:01:28.360]  among nations.
[1:01:28.360 --> 1:01:34.440]  Yeah, chances are if even Beijing is taken aback by your level of authoritarianism, that's
[1:01:34.440 --> 1:01:37.160]  a pretty draconian brand of authoritarianism.
[1:01:37.160 --> 1:01:42.040]  Now obviously on the one hand China is just clapping back at Australia for the Morrison
[1:01:42.040 --> 1:01:47.560]  government's earlier criticism of China's atrocious disregard for human rights when
[1:01:47.560 --> 1:01:52.840]  it came to imposing its own lockdown, but the fact remains, he who fought with monsters
[1:01:52.840 --> 1:01:55.120]  has become the monster.
[1:01:55.120 --> 1:02:00.440]  Australia gazed into the abyss and now the abyss gazes back at Australia because just
[1:02:00.440 --> 1:02:07.280]  like communist China, Australia is now officially a biosecurity police state.
[1:02:07.280 --> 1:02:10.040]  Australia is a post-democratic country.
[1:02:10.040 --> 1:02:15.240]  How else could you describe a country where protest is outlawed, where under a newly proposed
[1:02:15.240 --> 1:02:20.000]  law those who risk arrest by even daring to attend a demonstration are subject to onerous
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:25.800]  fines of up to five and a half thousand dollars, where those who merely post anti-lockdown
[1:02:25.800 --> 1:02:31.920]  information online could face fines of up to eleven thousand dollars, where protest
[1:02:31.920 --> 1:02:37.520]  organisers face fines of twenty thousand dollars, where pregnant women who promote such protests
[1:02:37.520 --> 1:02:41.280]  on Facebook are arrested in front of their kids in their own homes.
[1:02:41.280 --> 1:02:45.240]  How else could you describe a country where people face five hundred dollar fines for
[1:02:45.240 --> 1:02:51.760]  failing to wear a face mask outside where surveillance drones are deployed to catch the unmasked?
[1:02:51.760 --> 1:02:57.040]  They're the eyes and voices in the sky.
[1:02:57.040 --> 1:03:01.640]  Where grandma's sitting on park benches are arrested for not wearing masks, where the
[1:03:01.640 --> 1:03:06.800]  public is ordered by top health officials not to speak to each other, even if they're
[1:03:06.800 --> 1:03:07.800]  wearing masks.
[1:03:07.800 --> 1:03:14.840]  Whilst it is in human nature to engage in conversation with others, to be friendly,
[1:03:14.840 --> 1:03:18.680]  unfortunately, this is not the time to do that.
[1:03:18.680 --> 1:03:24.800]  So even if you run into your next door neighbour in the shopping centre, in the Coles, Coles
[1:03:24.800 --> 1:03:31.640]  Wars or Aldi or any other grocery shop, don't start up a conversation.
[1:03:31.640 --> 1:03:35.800]  Now is the time for minimising your interactions with others.
[1:03:35.800 --> 1:03:38.800]  Even if you've got a mask, don't start up a conversation.
[1:03:38.800 --> 1:03:43.400]  How else could you describe a country where police have the power to enter homes without
[1:03:43.400 --> 1:03:47.080]  a warrant to ensure compliance with coronavirus rules?
[1:03:47.080 --> 1:03:51.160]  Where authorities gave themselves the power to remove children from the custody of their
[1:03:51.160 --> 1:03:54.800]  parents to ensure compliance with coronavirus rules?
[1:03:54.800 --> 1:03:59.560]  Where people are prevented from travelling further than three kilometres from their homes?
[1:03:59.560 --> 1:04:04.280]  Where surveillance choppers are used to track down people who camp in remote locations?
[1:04:04.280 --> 1:04:08.200]  Where senior government ministers refuse to rule out Australians being forced to wear
[1:04:08.200 --> 1:04:13.800]  electronic ankle bracelets, even if they're fully vaccinated to make sure they're complying
[1:04:13.800 --> 1:04:18.040]  with home quarantine orders, where laws are under consideration giving authorities the
[1:04:18.040 --> 1:04:22.960]  power to arrest, quote, conspiracy theorists, if it's thought they may commit a crime in
[1:04:22.960 --> 1:04:23.960]  the future.
[1:04:23.960 --> 1:04:30.400]  Australia continues to pursue a disastrous zero COVID policy that has seen towns 800
[1:04:30.400 --> 1:04:36.080]  miles from the nearest city locked down after just one single COVID case.
[1:04:36.080 --> 1:04:42.280]  The country also continues to impose medical martial law measures that are so despotic
[1:04:42.280 --> 1:04:44.480]  that even China is jealous.
[1:04:44.480 --> 1:04:49.160]  When the world's leading communist dictatorship expresses surprise at the lengths you're prepared
[1:04:49.160 --> 1:04:54.320]  to go to to subjugate your own population, you know for sure that something's bottom
[1:04:54.320 --> 1:04:55.320]  down on you.
[1:04:55.320 --> 1:05:06.080]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that
[1:05:06.080 --> 1:05:07.080]  I've ever done.

[1:05:11.800 --> 1:05:15.000]  in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[1:05:15.000 --> 1:05:17.040]  Well it's all come down to this.

[1:06:26.560 --> 1:06:36.000]  The region Fox26 reporter Ivory Hecker is live in Montgomery County to take a look at that
[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:39.000]  aspect.
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:40.000]  Thanks guys, that's right.
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:44.520]  Before we get to that story, I want to let you the viewers know that Fox Corp has been
[1:06:44.520 --> 1:06:48.880]  muscling me to keep certain information from you the viewers and from what I'm gathering
[1:06:48.880 --> 1:06:52.400]  I am not the only reporter being too subjected to this.
[1:06:52.400 --> 1:06:56.480]  I am going to be releasing some recordings about what goes on behind the scenes at Fox
[1:06:56.480 --> 1:06:58.160]  because it applies to you, the viewers.
[1:06:58.160 --> 1:07:02.360]  I found a nonprofit journalism group called Project Veritas, it's going to help put that
[1:07:02.360 --> 1:07:04.440]  out tomorrow, so tune into them.
[1:07:04.440 --> 1:07:10.120]  But as for this heat wave across Texas, you can see what it's doing to AC units.
[1:07:10.120 --> 1:07:12.320]  This one, broken down as we.
[1:07:12.320 --> 1:07:15.360]  All right, so that's Ivory Hecker, I guess a month and a half ago, seems like a hundred
[1:07:15.360 --> 1:07:16.360]  years ago now.
[1:07:16.360 --> 1:07:20.800]  And then she got censored at CPAC by Fox, again, it was in control of the production.
[1:07:20.800 --> 1:07:25.680]  So censoring going on everywhere, but not here at the dreaded evil info wars.
[1:07:25.680 --> 1:07:26.680]  I love that.
[1:07:26.680 --> 1:07:27.760]  I love that.
[1:07:27.760 --> 1:07:31.280]  You are at the black sheep command base right now.
[1:07:31.280 --> 1:07:34.280]  And the black outfit dress code is going to be here.
[1:07:34.280 --> 1:07:35.280]  You bet.
[1:07:35.280 --> 1:07:38.600]  We did not talk on the phone today to color coordinate this first time we met.
[1:07:38.600 --> 1:07:39.880]  So it's great to have you here.
[1:07:39.880 --> 1:07:41.640]  Wow, so much going on.
[1:07:41.640 --> 1:07:42.960]  Tell the viewers a little bit about yourself.
[1:07:42.960 --> 1:07:43.960]  This is uncensored.
[1:07:43.960 --> 1:07:47.720]  This is live and about what you're doing right now, how you're launching a new major operation
[1:07:47.720 --> 1:07:48.720]  today.
[1:07:48.720 --> 1:07:53.800]  Yeah, I just launched my brand new website, Ivory Hecker.com.
[1:07:53.800 --> 1:07:58.800]  So I'm going to be able to upload uncensored journalism there.
[1:07:58.800 --> 1:08:03.320]  I'm going to cover all the topics Fox didn't want me to cover.
[1:08:03.320 --> 1:08:09.920]  And my first upload on there is actually a video of my Fox bosses in their own words,
[1:08:09.920 --> 1:08:15.800]  what they were really up to more of the soundbites that Project Veritas wasn't able to fit in.
[1:08:15.800 --> 1:08:19.920]  And that video, when I actually tried putting on YouTube, it got banned.
[1:08:19.920 --> 1:08:24.520]  So now it's on my own website, but I'm going to have a lot more original journalism on
[1:08:24.520 --> 1:08:25.520]  there as well.
[1:08:25.520 --> 1:08:26.520]  Wow, it's incredible.
[1:08:26.520 --> 1:08:30.120]  Just three years ago, YouTube was denying that they were censoring me and others.
[1:08:30.120 --> 1:08:32.880]  Now they censor the president of the United States, President Trump.
[1:08:32.880 --> 1:08:33.880]  Now they censor you.
[1:08:33.880 --> 1:08:36.600]  And for those that don't know, tell them what you were being censored about.
[1:08:36.600 --> 1:08:40.480]  I was talking to doctors in Houston about what was working on their patients.
[1:08:40.480 --> 1:08:41.480]  Oh, yeah.
[1:08:41.480 --> 1:08:48.480]  And Fox is, as far as I can tell, on a massive censorship campaign in lockstep with the Social
[1:08:48.480 --> 1:08:50.480]  Media Corporations right now.
[1:08:50.480 --> 1:08:57.280]  But I first really became aware of Fox's censorship campaign when I was covering a
[1:08:57.280 --> 1:09:04.040]  Houston doctor last summer, but then I watched their lockstep with the same sort of censorship
[1:09:04.040 --> 1:09:10.480]  social media corporations, the topics that they censor, corporate news censors too.
[1:09:10.480 --> 1:09:13.440]  And so did you ever discover if they had a list of things they weren't supposed to do
[1:09:13.440 --> 1:09:15.760]  or was just verbally they told you what to do?
[1:09:15.760 --> 1:09:16.760]  It was verbally.
[1:09:16.760 --> 1:09:23.680]  It was, it was not some memo passed around, but it's really funny because I went to this
[1:09:23.680 --> 1:09:29.680]  women's empowerment event recently and when one of the young women heard I was a reporter,
[1:09:29.680 --> 1:09:34.240]  her first question, not knowing anything about me, she was like, is there a memo that you
[1:09:34.240 --> 1:09:39.560]  guys passed around of like what your talking points are as a mainstream media member?
[1:09:39.560 --> 1:09:44.760]  And I was like, no, but it seems like that isn't isn't it because everyone's in lockstep
[1:09:44.760 --> 1:09:45.760]  together.
[1:09:45.760 --> 1:09:46.760]  Oh, definitely.
[1:09:46.760 --> 1:09:47.760]  The managers do.
[1:09:47.760 --> 1:09:51.240]  And we've actually now gotten some of those memos, some of that's come out now where the
[1:09:51.240 --> 1:09:55.840]  big corporate heads are basically told the UN is the boss, what they say is what happens.
[1:09:55.840 --> 1:09:59.800]  And then the you since when did the UN take control of local Fox in Houston?
[1:09:59.800 --> 1:10:00.800]  But let's see.
[1:10:00.800 --> 1:10:01.800]  That's the compartmentalization.
[1:10:01.800 --> 1:10:04.280]  They don't even know it's coming down from the United Nations.
[1:10:04.280 --> 1:10:05.280]  Right.
[1:10:05.280 --> 1:10:12.080]  I'm a Fox Corp employee, so Lachlan Murdoch Rupert Son was my CEO.
[1:10:12.080 --> 1:10:19.040]  So you know, there's there's 28 major box local stations that are all headed up by Lachlan
[1:10:19.040 --> 1:10:20.480]  Murdoch.
[1:10:20.480 --> 1:10:25.000]  And basically what he and his people say goes.
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:29.600]  And when I pressed my boss, why are you coming at my throat for no reason?
[1:10:29.600 --> 1:10:33.240]  Why are you coming at my throat for doing journalism?
[1:10:33.240 --> 1:10:36.760]  She finally admitted to me that it was because of her bosses.
[1:10:36.760 --> 1:10:40.720]  So her strings were being pulled from the top in New York.
[1:10:40.720 --> 1:10:44.440]  And that's when I realized I need out prior to that.
[1:10:44.440 --> 1:10:46.120]  I loved Fox.
[1:10:46.120 --> 1:10:47.720]  I wanted to stay with Fox.
[1:10:47.720 --> 1:10:49.520]  You saw behind the curtain.
[1:10:49.520 --> 1:10:50.520]  Yeah.
[1:10:50.520 --> 1:10:53.040]  Well, let's talk about that specifically specifically.
[1:10:53.040 --> 1:10:56.680]  What was the report that made them so upset that they said you couldn't do that?
[1:10:56.680 --> 1:11:02.320]  Well, it was Dr. Joseph Farone at United Memorial Medical Center in Houston.
[1:11:02.320 --> 1:11:08.280]  I was sent to his hospital last August, actually nearly a year ago.
[1:11:08.280 --> 1:11:10.560]  Fox sent me to go cover him.
[1:11:10.560 --> 1:11:15.520]  I had never met him before, hadn't paid attention to him.
[1:11:15.520 --> 1:11:22.200]  But it was something he said that caused Fox to want to discipline me.
[1:11:22.200 --> 1:11:32.080]  And that was him admitting that he uses hydroxychloroquine on his patients and that it is going well.
[1:11:32.080 --> 1:11:39.720]  Because the UN and Fauci and the government had said only these injections are good, which
[1:11:39.720 --> 1:11:45.120]  they could only get those injections authorized and emergency authorization if there was no
[1:11:45.120 --> 1:11:46.920]  other known treatments.
[1:11:46.920 --> 1:11:51.480]  Because there were all these other very well ethical treatments, they could not allow those
[1:11:51.480 --> 1:11:54.240]  or they couldn't then get emergency authorization.
[1:11:54.240 --> 1:11:55.720]  It just seems that way.
[1:11:55.720 --> 1:12:01.840]  So last August when this was happening to me, they were on this fast track with the
[1:12:01.840 --> 1:12:02.840]  vaccines, right?
[1:12:02.840 --> 1:12:07.920]  So they needed to create an environment where nothing else is working or there's no treatment
[1:12:07.920 --> 1:12:09.240]  out there.
[1:12:09.240 --> 1:12:13.800]  And if you're hearing that doctors on the ground are using it because it wasn't just
[1:12:13.800 --> 1:12:21.840]  Dr. Farone, every time I brought up the topic of hydroxychloroquine, I'd get all these floods
[1:12:21.840 --> 1:12:25.960]  of emails and messages from viewers saying, oh, my doctor prescribed it too.
[1:12:25.960 --> 1:12:28.080]  It worked for me too.
[1:12:28.080 --> 1:12:33.880]  It was like this underground operation of something that the media didn't want to touch.
[1:12:33.880 --> 1:12:35.520]  Organic humans communicating with each other.
[1:12:35.520 --> 1:12:36.520]  How un-American.
[1:12:36.520 --> 1:12:37.520]  Stop that.
[1:12:37.520 --> 1:12:38.520]  Yeah.
[1:12:38.520 --> 1:12:44.520]  So Fox, not only did they say, don't touch this topic anymore.
[1:12:44.520 --> 1:12:49.240]  I mean, not just hydroxychloroquine, they said, Iver, you're banned from COVID drug treatment.
[1:12:49.240 --> 1:12:51.680]  You can't cover that topic at all.
[1:12:51.680 --> 1:12:56.680]  Meanwhile, big research was happening on Ivermectin.
[1:12:56.680 --> 1:12:58.720]  And I wasn't supposed to touch that.
[1:12:58.720 --> 1:13:04.640]  When I checked the Fox archives, not a single person at my TV station touched that topic.
[1:13:04.640 --> 1:13:07.480]  Again, because they didn't want you to go to your doctor and ask for that.
[1:13:07.480 --> 1:13:10.400]  They wanted you to go instead of a hospital, be put on a ventilator and die, then they
[1:13:10.400 --> 1:13:13.200]  get $53,000 for that.
[1:13:13.200 --> 1:13:16.880]  Expanding on that, you go to CPAC.
[1:13:16.880 --> 1:13:19.280]  And again, Fox is the sponsor of that.
[1:13:19.280 --> 1:13:21.440]  What a dumb move to turn your microphone down.
[1:13:21.440 --> 1:13:24.400]  I mean, we can play the clip, everybody heard about it and saw it.
[1:13:24.400 --> 1:13:29.320]  Didn't that make your speech 10 times bigger that they censored you again later at another
[1:13:29.320 --> 1:13:31.000]  event that they were the sponsor of?
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  Oh, yeah.
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:34.840]  That only hurts Fox if they're cutting my feed.
[1:13:34.840 --> 1:13:40.040]  And look, they, Fox didn't turn my microphone down because it, I mean, CPAC was in charge
[1:13:40.040 --> 1:13:42.520]  of the mic and CPAC kept their camera.
[1:13:42.520 --> 1:13:45.160]  Oh, well, then all I knew on TV is I saw it fade down.
[1:13:45.160 --> 1:13:47.120]  Oh, you mean, their, their feet.
[1:13:47.120 --> 1:13:54.120]  So, yeah, Fox Nation, I was told by viewers in the audience that Fox Nation cut the feed
[1:13:54.120 --> 1:13:56.400]  when that's what I meant was their feet out of there.
[1:13:56.400 --> 1:13:57.400]  Yeah.
[1:13:57.400 --> 1:13:58.400]  Yeah.
[1:13:58.400 --> 1:14:01.400]  Not your specific microphone, but then your feed got faded down.
[1:14:01.400 --> 1:14:02.400]  Yeah.
[1:14:02.400 --> 1:14:06.320]  And some, you know, I just coming out of that speech, people in the audience came up to
[1:14:06.320 --> 1:14:07.800]  me furious.
[1:14:07.800 --> 1:14:11.480]  They were wearing CPAC lanyards that said Fox on the, you know, because Fox was the
[1:14:11.480 --> 1:14:12.480]  primary sponsor.
[1:14:12.480 --> 1:14:14.440]  They said, we're getting rid of these lanyards.
[1:14:14.440 --> 1:14:17.600]  We're turning them into Matt Schlapp first thing tomorrow.
[1:14:17.600 --> 1:14:18.600]  That's right.
[1:14:18.600 --> 1:14:22.960]  Because the whole, they did CPAC a second time this year because the other one censored everybody.
[1:14:22.960 --> 1:14:25.400]  And so now this one was supposedly against censorship.
[1:14:25.400 --> 1:14:27.040]  And then here it happened again.
[1:14:27.040 --> 1:14:32.480]  And it's so interesting to me that now Fox, you know, election day, Fox took a huge hit
[1:14:32.480 --> 1:14:37.360]  I'm with its ratings, Fox basically committed suicide on the national level with how they
[1:14:37.360 --> 1:14:39.120]  approached election day coverage.
[1:14:39.120 --> 1:14:45.960]  So now after that, they're pouring money into conservative events to try to get their audience
[1:14:45.960 --> 1:14:46.960]  back.
[1:14:46.960 --> 1:14:51.640]  So they're being, they're the primary sponsor of CPAC to try to win back the audience that
[1:14:51.640 --> 1:14:53.960]  they alienated on election day.
[1:14:53.960 --> 1:15:01.080]  And then they went on to be the primary sponsor of turning point as well, which I was initially
[1:15:01.080 --> 1:15:03.720]  invited to and then uninvited to.
[1:15:03.720 --> 1:15:04.720]  Yeah.
[1:15:04.720 --> 1:15:08.480]  Well, I mean, I don't bash other Republican or conservative groups because I'm not in
[1:15:08.480 --> 1:15:09.480]  competition with them.
[1:15:09.480 --> 1:15:13.000]  I wish that I intellectually want them to be, you know, good people.
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:16.920]  But Charlie Kirk and that whole thing is like the bubblegum happy conservative.
[1:15:16.920 --> 1:15:20.880]  Oh, we're going to convince the kids to vote for us and we're going to have machines firing
[1:15:20.880 --> 1:15:22.960]  money out with strippers and stuff.
[1:15:22.960 --> 1:15:27.200]  And I just don't really think that's intellectually what anybody's looking for.
[1:15:27.200 --> 1:15:29.920]  And again, the Republican Party is almost as bad as a Democrat.
[1:15:29.920 --> 1:15:32.120]  That's why we're in so much trouble.
[1:15:32.120 --> 1:15:38.000]  You know, all of, all of this establishment politics is something I have no interest in
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:39.240]  being a part of.
[1:15:39.240 --> 1:15:45.800]  I was initially invited to these events to, to spread the word about my experience.
[1:15:45.800 --> 1:15:47.960]  And I said, that's great to have that platform.
[1:15:47.960 --> 1:15:49.920]  But if you don't want me there, cool.
[1:15:49.920 --> 1:15:53.160]  I don't need to be a part of, of, well, exactly.
[1:15:53.160 --> 1:15:54.480]  They invite you to uninvite you.
[1:15:54.480 --> 1:15:56.160]  It's all the power they have over people.
[1:15:56.160 --> 1:16:03.000]  We'll be right back with ivory heckers.
[1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:08.360]  Have you ever thought about turning your Glock, XD family or 1911 handgun into a semi automatic

[1:18:00.680 --> 1:18:05.480]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone
[1:18:05.480 --> 1:18:08.200]  from beta testing to operational.
[1:18:08.200 --> 1:18:12.960]  The globalists are out in the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot
[1:18:12.960 --> 1:18:13.960]  takeover.
[1:18:13.960 --> 1:18:17.400]  The good news is we've been working and you've been working, and others have been working
[1:18:17.400 --> 1:18:22.040]  across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to find it off.
[1:18:22.040 --> 1:18:26.160]  Humanity is strong, we're incredible, and if we're aware of the attack that's happening,
[1:18:26.160 --> 1:18:27.680]  we have a real chance of defeating it.
[1:18:27.680 --> 1:18:30.320]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[1:18:30.320 --> 1:18:34.560]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential, and warning
[1:18:34.560 --> 1:18:36.280]  others is absolutely essential.
[1:18:36.280 --> 1:18:40.800]  And at the same time, supporting info wars by buying high-quality products to keep us
[1:18:40.800 --> 1:18:44.480]  on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family, and they're
[1:18:44.480 --> 1:18:46.480]  also funding our operation.
[1:18:46.480 --> 1:18:52.400]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsStore.com is incredible, a lot of our products that have been sold
[1:18:52.400 --> 1:18:56.600]  out because the supply chain breakdowns are back in like bodies, vasobites, and others,
[1:18:56.600 --> 1:19:01.440]  so get them today at InfoWarsStore.com, and I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[1:19:01.440 --> 1:19:08.040]  The biosecurity state is here, it's an anti-human eugenics operation training us that humans
[1:19:08.040 --> 1:19:14.200]  are dirty, bad, and evil, the corrupt puppet prime minister of Canada who says he admires
[1:19:14.200 --> 1:19:19.360]  the communist dictatorship of ZGP and wishes to make Canada the same, has announced that
[1:19:19.360 --> 1:19:25.600]  they're buying vaccines for every person in the country all the way out to 2024, and that
[1:19:25.600 --> 1:19:30.920]  in 2024 you will again take two shots, and he says it'll be whatever Pfizer cooks up
[1:19:30.920 --> 1:19:32.720]  and wants to put in your body.
[1:19:32.720 --> 1:19:37.280]  This is the Rockefeller Foundation, they developed this whole plan with Bill Gates, we're now
[1:19:37.280 --> 1:19:41.360]  implementing it, and now they've announced that U.S. policy is set by the private Rockefeller
[1:19:41.360 --> 1:19:42.360]  Foundation.
[1:19:42.360 --> 1:19:47.800]  Of course, the Rockefeller Foundation by the 30s was the main funder of Adolf, Alas Hitler,
[1:19:47.800 --> 1:19:51.000]  and the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor that trained the Cozzerville Home Institute in
[1:19:51.000 --> 1:19:52.000]  Germany.
[1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:55.680]  InfoWars will continue to set fast, they fight this, and I don't know how long we can, the
[1:19:55.680 --> 1:19:58.520]  enemy's coming for us all now, and God bless, and good luck.
[1:19:58.520 --> 1:20:04.520]  I would again get right with God right now.
[1:20:04.520 --> 1:20:11.520]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:03:53.380 --> 1:20:49.280]  our guest in studio here in the Alex Jones show, and there's so many amazing
[1:20:49.280 --> 1:20:53.080]  reporters that are blowing the whistle, that are quitting, that are leaving their job,
[1:20:53.080 --> 1:20:58.040]  mainly because they've been told cover-up big tech such as ship cover-up, medical tyranny,
[1:20:58.040 --> 1:21:02.680]  and I'd say most of them are women, we've not seen a lot of men do that, and I'm not
[1:21:02.680 --> 1:21:08.640]  sure there's a male versus a female thing, but I know a lot of reporters around the country
[1:21:08.640 --> 1:21:13.320]  have reached out to you, I would imagine behind the scenes, but also publicly, saying they
[1:21:13.320 --> 1:21:15.240]  admire what you've done.
[1:21:15.240 --> 1:21:18.120]  The editor of Bill, the biggest publication in Europe's come out and apologized and said
[1:21:18.120 --> 1:21:22.520]  we suppressed the truth, we scared everybody, we're against the police state, we're against
[1:21:22.520 --> 1:21:25.920]  the lockdown, we're against covering up treatments, I'm sorry.
[1:21:25.920 --> 1:21:30.880]  Well, you didn't do the covering up, you refused up front, so I think it's going to be people
[1:21:30.880 --> 1:21:36.080]  like you and the editor of Bill are the example of a chain reaction of just finding our humanity
[1:21:36.080 --> 1:21:40.400]  and rejecting this corporate dictate to go along with their lives.
[1:21:40.400 --> 1:21:46.000]  Right, and yeah, there was a group of almost 30 journalists in the UK just the past couple
[1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:52.520]  weeks who came out and said the same thing of saying, look, we've been ordered into this
[1:21:52.520 --> 1:21:58.840]  lockstep of talking points coming straight from the government, and we're not able to
[1:21:58.840 --> 1:22:03.760]  get this straight, like what, are we an arm of government propaganda, or are we putting
[1:22:03.760 --> 1:22:04.760]  the citizens first?
[1:22:04.760 --> 1:22:07.920]  And it's been too much of the same thing in the United States as well.
[1:22:07.920 --> 1:22:13.800]  I have heard from dozens of journalists, and I'm going to be putting out some of their
[1:22:13.800 --> 1:22:21.000]  stories on my new website, and I'm also going to be covering everything that Fox didn't
[1:22:21.000 --> 1:22:22.000]  let me cover.
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:25.040]  See, I didn't even know that, I was about to say to you on air, tell me about what your
[1:22:25.040 --> 1:22:29.000]  mission is going to be, and it's like boom, exactly what I'd recommend is being a place
[1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:33.240]  to magnify folks even more than Project Veritas does because they're great, but we need more
[1:22:33.240 --> 1:22:38.520]  places to be launch pads for other journalists who are going to step forward and have that
[1:22:38.520 --> 1:22:41.280]  solidarity to get past the fear.
[1:22:41.280 --> 1:22:42.280]  Exactly.
[1:22:42.280 --> 1:22:47.520]  A lot of those journalists were women, but there was just a man in Hawaii actually, a
[1:22:47.520 --> 1:22:54.080]  Hawaii news anchor who came out and said, look, I was just let go from my station after
[1:22:54.080 --> 1:23:01.920]  a fiery conversation with his bosses about disseminating false information every day.
[1:23:01.920 --> 1:23:05.640]  He said, look, I'm not going to be reading this fake news on the teleprompter anymore,
[1:23:05.640 --> 1:23:11.760]  I refuse, and it got explosive and they let him go, and now he's speaking out about it.
[1:23:11.760 --> 1:23:13.960]  We don't realize what goes on behind the scenes.
[1:23:13.960 --> 1:23:19.580]  There's a lot of journalists who are really fed up with this, and a lot of them are quietly
[1:23:19.580 --> 1:23:26.000]  throwing in the towel, they've come to me after leaving their jobs saying why they got
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:30.720]  disheartened that they thought it was going to be journalism they were doing, and instead
[1:23:30.720 --> 1:23:36.600]  it's this corporate agenda, special interests of their bosses that they have to cover.
[1:23:36.600 --> 1:23:40.360]  And now they want us to have medical ID's to travel and take experimental shots and
[1:23:40.360 --> 1:23:44.080]  violation of the Nuremberg code, and they're trying to gaslight us like it's normal, so
[1:23:44.080 --> 1:23:47.760]  they're using this as the pretext to lock down businesses that aren't globalist to tell
[1:23:47.760 --> 1:23:53.240]  us we're not essential, and to make us accept a worldwide ID, I mean, this is a nightmare
[1:23:53.240 --> 1:23:54.240]  scenario.
[1:23:54.240 --> 1:24:00.520]  Yeah, I'm really concerned about the vaccine issue, true seeking journalists, I think they're
[1:24:00.520 --> 1:24:07.280]  getting red alerts going off in their heads about this because there is just such a strong
[1:24:07.280 --> 1:24:13.480]  railroaded narrative of overhyping the vaccines, and that's one thing that drove me away from
[1:24:13.480 --> 1:24:19.200]  Fox as well, you know, I have these recordings with my boss where she's saying, how can we
[1:24:19.200 --> 1:24:26.680]  get to these kids, she calls a meeting to figure out how we can get this ticker up on
[1:24:26.680 --> 1:24:31.120]  how many people have been vaccinated, we need to craft our coverage to make parents want
[1:24:31.120 --> 1:24:38.080]  to inject their kids purely agenda driven, that's propaganda, and I and I told my bosses,
[1:24:38.080 --> 1:24:42.680]  you're doing propaganda, they were so offended that I said that, but it was true.
[1:24:42.680 --> 1:24:48.080]  And then they're at the same time telling me I cannot report the number of deaths after
[1:24:48.080 --> 1:24:53.680]  vaccination data straight from the CDC, that's aiding and abetting an experimental shot to
[1:24:53.680 --> 1:24:57.200]  cover up the death, I mean, that's, that's the full circle of tyranny.
[1:24:57.200 --> 1:25:03.840]  Yeah, so now, now I'm actually working on coverage related to the vaccines as we speak.
[1:25:03.840 --> 1:25:08.400]  When I was with Fox, we were getting tips about these healthy young people who were
[1:25:08.400 --> 1:25:12.840]  just dying immediately after vaccination and we never put those stories on air.
[1:25:12.840 --> 1:25:13.840]  Wow.
[1:25:13.840 --> 1:25:17.680]  So, so, so there's thousands we know of, but you're saying you saw someone Houston no
[1:25:17.680 --> 1:25:18.680]  one ever heard of.
[1:25:18.680 --> 1:25:19.680]  Yes.
[1:25:19.680 --> 1:25:20.680]  Wow.
[1:25:20.680 --> 1:25:25.080]  And actually, I mean, one, one 38 year old man, we heard about his death back in I think
[1:25:25.080 --> 1:25:26.600]  April.
[1:25:26.600 --> 1:25:32.760]  And at last check, I still don't have the autopsy results back.
[1:25:32.760 --> 1:25:34.760]  What's taking so long?
[1:25:34.760 --> 1:25:40.520]  I'm, I'm next week, I'm going to be meeting with the father of a 16 year old boy who had
[1:25:40.520 --> 1:25:45.000]  a perfect healthy heart before he got the shot.
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:52.960]  And then days after getting the Pfizer shot, this young boy died of an enlarged heart.
[1:25:52.960 --> 1:25:57.320]  So I'm going to be meeting with that dad covering his story.
[1:25:57.320 --> 1:26:01.600]  He's trying to put the word out that which by the way, I'm sorry, they admit it's causing
[1:26:01.600 --> 1:26:03.200]  this heart swelling.
[1:26:03.200 --> 1:26:04.200]  Yeah.
[1:26:04.200 --> 1:26:05.200]  Yeah.
[1:26:05.200 --> 1:26:10.240]  Now, at least microcardiitis or have you said exactly there, there's more and more
[1:26:10.240 --> 1:26:15.720]  information coming out about possible negative heart effects on the kids.
[1:26:15.720 --> 1:26:16.720]  And what was it?
[1:26:16.720 --> 1:26:17.720]  You said the dad wanted to get out.
[1:26:17.720 --> 1:26:18.720]  I interrupted you.
[1:26:18.720 --> 1:26:19.720]  Oh yeah.
[1:26:19.720 --> 1:26:20.720]  Yeah.
[1:26:20.720 --> 1:26:24.040]  He's just, he's created this Facebook banner saying Pfizer killed his son and he's trying
[1:26:24.040 --> 1:26:25.880]  to get the word out.
[1:26:25.880 --> 1:26:29.200]  And when I asked him, did you file a VAERS report?
[1:26:29.200 --> 1:26:30.440]  He said, what's that?
[1:26:30.440 --> 1:26:32.680]  So that was alarming to me.
[1:26:32.680 --> 1:26:37.320]  It's like how many parents are there who don't even know what VAERS is, the reporting system
[1:26:37.320 --> 1:26:38.320]  for adverse.
[1:26:38.320 --> 1:26:44.120]  And by the way, VAERS, back up, I don't want went down last week, magically, it's back
[1:26:44.120 --> 1:26:45.120]  up.
[1:26:45.120 --> 1:26:46.120]  Wow.
[1:26:46.120 --> 1:26:47.120]  Good.
[1:26:47.120 --> 1:26:48.120]  Yeah.
[1:26:48.120 --> 1:26:49.120]  So I think there's so many untold stories.
[1:26:49.120 --> 1:26:50.120]  I interviewed another woman.
[1:26:50.120 --> 1:26:55.040]  I'm going to be putting her story out on my new website, ivoryhacker.com, because it's,
[1:26:55.040 --> 1:26:59.800]  this is stuff you can't post on social media, it'll be taken down, but just seeing how her
[1:26:59.800 --> 1:27:04.440]  body has been permanently affected.
[1:27:04.440 --> 1:27:14.280]  Her body is forever ruined because of the shot, that her side effects are horrifying
[1:27:14.280 --> 1:27:18.320]  and you're going to see what happened to her in my report.
[1:27:18.320 --> 1:27:22.960]  And the saddest thing is she can't get anyone to diagnose this.
[1:27:22.960 --> 1:27:24.480]  Nobody knows what happened.
[1:27:24.480 --> 1:27:28.440]  She said doctors are telling her, I'm sorry, this vaccine is just too new.
[1:27:28.440 --> 1:27:32.800]  So we don't know why your, your body is uncontrollably shaking.
[1:27:32.800 --> 1:27:33.800]  You have no control.
[1:27:33.800 --> 1:27:36.880]  And that's the key is that they got emergency authorization.
[1:27:36.880 --> 1:27:41.120]  So they never would do the actual studies because they had done studies of similar vaccines
[1:27:41.120 --> 1:27:45.280]  for similar viruses, Fauci had, and knew what the result would be.
[1:27:45.280 --> 1:27:49.720]  And so then they had them skip this so that they would just get it approved in an emergency
[1:27:49.720 --> 1:27:51.280]  status but never have it looked at.
[1:27:51.280 --> 1:27:52.880]  Talk about premeditated evil.
[1:27:52.880 --> 1:27:55.120]  Yeah, it's, it's pretty horrible.
[1:27:55.120 --> 1:28:00.040]  So that website is brand new ivoryhacker.com and I'm going to be putting a lot of content
[1:28:00.040 --> 1:28:01.040]  up there.
[1:28:01.040 --> 1:28:05.440]  But for now, my first video up there is the one that was banned from YouTube.
[1:28:05.440 --> 1:28:08.720]  The true story of what Fox was up to in their own words.
[1:28:08.720 --> 1:28:09.720]  And that's extra stuff.
[1:28:09.720 --> 1:28:12.480]  It's not just in the excellent Project Veritas report.
[1:28:12.480 --> 1:28:13.480]  Exactly.
[1:28:13.480 --> 1:28:15.360]  Isn't James O'Keefe a cool guy?
[1:28:15.360 --> 1:28:16.560]  Yeah, he's great.
[1:28:16.560 --> 1:28:23.000]  I really respect the journalism that he does are he, he shows video and audio people in
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:24.000]  their own words.
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:26.720]  You know, that's where we've got to be at with journalism now.
[1:28:26.720 --> 1:28:30.180]  So few people trust anything the news is saying.
[1:28:30.180 --> 1:28:36.960]  So if you can show video of what people are really up to, that's what audiences want to
[1:28:36.960 --> 1:28:37.960]  see now.
[1:28:37.960 --> 1:28:41.720]  They don't, they don't trust the written word as much anymore.
[1:28:41.720 --> 1:28:43.440]  There's just so much fake news out there.
[1:28:43.440 --> 1:28:44.440]  That's right.
[1:28:44.440 --> 1:28:45.440]  They don't want to be told about something.
[1:28:45.440 --> 1:28:47.200]  They want to see it for themselves.
[1:28:47.200 --> 1:28:50.520]  And then when you question big events, the media doesn't think that's a good thing.
[1:28:50.520 --> 1:28:51.520]  You shouldn't do it.
[1:28:51.520 --> 1:28:56.040]  When we come back, we'll talk about this wonderful young lady that won the gold medal who didn't
[1:28:56.040 --> 1:28:58.480]  attack America when she won it was very refreshing.
[1:28:58.480 --> 1:28:59.800]  Stay with us.
[1:28:59.800 --> 1:29:03.360]  So many people say to me, Alex, please stop being so negative.
[1:29:03.360 --> 1:29:09.440]  Well, for me, admitting I've gotten a rotten tooth and going in a root canal is not negative.
[1:29:09.440 --> 1:29:10.440]  It hurts.
[1:29:10.440 --> 1:29:11.600]  It stinks.
[1:29:11.600 --> 1:29:12.760]  It's got pus coming out of it.
[1:29:12.760 --> 1:29:13.760]  I go to the doctor.
[1:29:13.760 --> 1:29:14.760]  They fix it.
[1:29:14.760 --> 1:29:15.760]  That's not negative.
[1:29:15.760 --> 1:29:16.760]  I'm not living in denial.
[1:29:16.760 --> 1:29:21.840]  And so think of globalism as being hidden as an infection that we didn't feel yet, but
[1:29:21.840 --> 1:29:23.400]  now it's come to the surface.
[1:29:23.400 --> 1:29:25.360]  That's actually a positive thing.
[1:29:25.360 --> 1:29:27.640]  And so yeah, Trump did an overall great job.
[1:29:27.640 --> 1:29:28.640]  They stole the election.
[1:29:28.640 --> 1:29:30.720]  We can't get down about that.
[1:29:30.720 --> 1:29:34.560]  We have forced them out in the open.
[1:29:34.560 --> 1:29:37.920]  So now they're trying to suppress us because they know they've been exposed.
[1:29:37.920 --> 1:29:38.920]  They're scared.
[1:29:38.920 --> 1:29:41.360]  That's why, instead of saying, oh, we're a bunch of losers.
[1:29:41.360 --> 1:29:42.360]  Look what happened.
[1:29:42.360 --> 1:29:43.360]  No, we're a bunch of winners.
[1:29:43.360 --> 1:29:48.840]  They're trying to suppress us, let our light of truth shine and tell everybody what's happening.
[1:29:48.840 --> 1:29:52.600]  Your own website, your own show, my show, other articles, other videos.
[1:29:52.600 --> 1:29:56.720]  Just keep sharing however you can and realize we're in an information war.
[1:29:56.720 --> 1:29:59.520]  We're going to win this together in the Fight Starts at FullWars.com.
[1:29:59.520 --> 1:30:03.520]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut.
[1:30:03.520 --> 1:30:04.520]  You're on the air.
[1:30:04.520 --> 1:30:05.520]  Thanks for holding.
[1:30:05.520 --> 1:30:06.520]  Hello.
[1:30:06.520 --> 1:30:07.520]  Can you hear me?
[1:30:07.520 --> 1:30:08.520]  I sure can, sir.
[1:30:08.520 --> 1:30:09.520]  Thank you.
[1:30:09.520 --> 1:30:10.520]  Hey, Alex.
[1:30:10.520 --> 1:30:11.520]  Before I start, man, I just wanted to talk to you, bro.
[1:30:11.520 --> 1:30:13.520]  It's a pleasure to be talking right now, here, man.
[1:30:13.520 --> 1:30:15.520]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[1:30:15.520 --> 1:30:19.520]  I'm from New Brink, Connecticut, and I just want to plug in.
[1:30:19.520 --> 1:30:23.520]  I'm a truck driver, and two before us have changed the way I drive.
[1:30:23.520 --> 1:30:25.520]  Me and my brothers that drive.
[1:30:25.520 --> 1:30:27.520]  There's a couple of us.
[1:30:27.520 --> 1:30:30.520]  We're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans.
[1:30:30.520 --> 1:30:36.520]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and Rolla, and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking
[1:30:36.520 --> 1:30:39.520]  all that sugar, and I just want to thank you for that, man.
[1:30:39.520 --> 1:30:44.520]  We put more in this than any other long-term, high-quality energy powder there is.
[1:30:44.520 --> 1:30:46.520]  So this was designed on one of the top guys in the country.
[1:30:46.520 --> 1:30:49.520]  He didn't want his name on it because, obviously, the political issues, but we had to pay a
[1:30:49.520 --> 1:30:51.520]  lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it.
[1:30:51.520 --> 1:30:56.520]  And we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there, and you're
[1:30:56.520 --> 1:30:58.520]  saying that it's made your life better, so that means a lot to me.
[1:30:58.520 --> 1:30:59.520]  Thank you to all your truck drivers.
[1:30:59.520 --> 1:31:00.520]  We love you.

[1:32:11.520 --> 1:32:13.520]  my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[1:32:13.520 --> 1:32:16.520]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[1:32:16.520 --> 1:32:21.520]  I'm having a cybersupposium on August 10th, 11th, and 12th.

[1:33:18.520 --> 1:33:35.520]  Well, people like Ivory Hecker, who's riding a shotgun with me here on the Alex Jones show
[1:33:35.520 --> 1:33:38.520]  today, are the future of not just this country but the world.
[1:33:38.520 --> 1:33:44.520]  They have the courage to stand up and expose the fact that they were asking her to cover
[1:33:44.520 --> 1:33:49.520]  up life-saving information from medical doctors and suppress the truth about ivermectin and
[1:33:49.520 --> 1:33:52.520]  other things, and like Hondroxychloroquine, and thanks to her and many others.
[1:33:52.520 --> 1:33:53.520]  The truth is out there.
[1:33:53.520 --> 1:33:55.520]  A lot of lives have been saved.
[1:33:55.520 --> 1:34:00.520]  But think about how George Arwell said, in a world of universal deceit, telling the truth
[1:34:00.520 --> 1:34:02.520]  is a revolutionary act.
[1:34:02.520 --> 1:34:07.520]  And that happened a few days ago with U.S. Olympian proclaimed her love for her country,
[1:34:07.520 --> 1:34:10.520]  Tamara Minsha Stock.
[1:34:10.520 --> 1:34:13.520]  She won the big wrestling competition, Gold Medal.
[1:34:13.520 --> 1:34:16.520]  Now, just a few decades ago, this would be completely normal.
[1:34:16.520 --> 1:34:17.520]  It's your country.
[1:34:17.520 --> 1:34:18.520]  It paid for you to go there.
[1:34:18.520 --> 1:34:21.520]  It is a competition between nations.
[1:34:21.520 --> 1:34:26.520]  We all exchange each other's cultures and ideas and sports, and it's a great melting pot,
[1:34:26.520 --> 1:34:28.520]  and it brings humanity together.
[1:34:28.520 --> 1:34:32.520]  But instead, most of the people we hear up there running down America, because that's
[1:34:32.520 --> 1:34:33.520]  what big corporations want.
[1:34:33.520 --> 1:34:39.520]  They want an end to the nation state and the end of nation states challenging the monopoly
[1:34:39.520 --> 1:34:42.520]  power of big corporations that are bigger than most governments.
[1:34:42.520 --> 1:34:44.520]  So I'm a libertarian, but a little L.
[1:34:44.520 --> 1:34:48.520]  I don't believe corporations should have more power than the people or governments.
[1:34:48.520 --> 1:34:52.520]  You need checks and balances, and that's what globalism is, is big corporations becoming
[1:34:52.520 --> 1:34:55.520]  the government and becoming a very authoritarian government.
[1:34:55.520 --> 1:34:57.520]  But here's a short clip of what she had to say.
[1:34:57.520 --> 1:34:59.520]  And again, how is this a revolutionary act?
[1:34:59.520 --> 1:35:00.520]  It's commonplace.
[1:35:00.520 --> 1:35:01.520]  It's common sense.
[1:35:01.520 --> 1:35:02.520]  It's well said.
[1:35:02.520 --> 1:35:04.520]  She's a lovely young woman who just won the gold medal.
[1:35:04.520 --> 1:35:06.520]  But so then why is this so radical?
[1:35:06.520 --> 1:35:09.520]  Well, because it's a world of universal deceit.
[1:35:09.520 --> 1:35:14.520]  I'm feeling very happy, and I keep trying not to cry, but it keeps happening.
[1:35:14.520 --> 1:35:19.520]  I just want to go into a dark room and just cry.
[1:35:19.520 --> 1:35:22.520]  I'm going to cry from joy.
[1:35:22.520 --> 1:35:27.520]  For women, wrestling has only been an Olympic sport for not even two decades.
[1:35:27.520 --> 1:35:31.520]  You are the second American woman to win gold.
[1:35:31.520 --> 1:35:35.520]  What does this mean for the popularity of the sport and for all the young girls out
[1:35:35.520 --> 1:35:37.520]  there that are going to see you and feel inspiration?
[1:35:37.520 --> 1:35:43.520]  It means that they see someone like themselves on that podium, someone like Helen on that
[1:35:43.520 --> 1:35:47.520]  podium, showing them just because you're a female, it doesn't mean you can't accomplish
[1:35:47.520 --> 1:35:49.520]  the biggest of goals.
[1:35:49.520 --> 1:35:55.520]  And being an Olympic champ is one of the hardest things I have ever done in my entire life.
[1:35:55.520 --> 1:35:58.520]  And I can say it's well worth it.
[1:35:58.520 --> 1:36:01.520]  And she went on to say in other interviews that she loves America and she's proud of
[1:36:01.520 --> 1:36:04.520]  her country, and the left actually attacked her some.
[1:36:04.520 --> 1:36:06.520]  They don't like this image because they think they own women.
[1:36:06.520 --> 1:36:09.520]  I think they really own black people and you're supposed to have a chip on your shoulder
[1:36:09.520 --> 1:36:12.520]  and you're a loser and men are out to get you.
[1:36:12.520 --> 1:36:14.520]  But the big corporations are your friends, really.
[1:36:14.520 --> 1:36:17.520]  The same big corporations you saw on Adder in the break were going to queue up and play
[1:36:17.520 --> 1:36:19.520]  for Mike Lindell.
[1:36:19.520 --> 1:36:21.520]  You said, did you know Fox Bandit?
[1:36:21.520 --> 1:36:25.520]  I said, no, that's why Mike reached out and he runs the ad with us to big national
[1:36:25.520 --> 1:36:29.520]  headlines of how dare him fund Alex Jones or run ads.
[1:36:29.520 --> 1:36:31.520]  It's a profit share of liberals.
[1:36:31.520 --> 1:36:32.520]  You don't know what that means.
[1:36:32.520 --> 1:36:33.520]  He doesn't pay me.
[1:36:33.520 --> 1:36:35.520]  I got a percentage of the sales, but they can't even understand that.
[1:36:35.520 --> 1:36:37.520]  It's all these Newsweek articles.
[1:36:37.520 --> 1:36:39.520]  They're saying, Joe, he's paying Jones now.
[1:36:39.520 --> 1:36:40.520]  No, that's not how it works.
[1:36:40.520 --> 1:36:41.520]  Idiots.
[1:36:41.520 --> 1:36:42.520]  But I'm sorry.
[1:36:42.520 --> 1:36:43.520]  They still get anything.
[1:36:43.520 --> 1:36:46.520]  But how is what she said radical?
[1:36:46.520 --> 1:36:47.520]  It's not.
[1:36:47.520 --> 1:36:48.520]  It's not.
[1:36:48.520 --> 1:36:55.520]  It was actually the most beautiful little authentic, giddy little girl so excited about, you
[1:36:55.520 --> 1:36:57.520]  know, the sound bite.
[1:36:57.520 --> 1:37:03.520]  I think it was right after what she said there that we saw the interviewer went on to say
[1:37:03.520 --> 1:37:06.520]  how does it feel to represent USA?
[1:37:06.520 --> 1:37:11.520]  And she was just jumping up and down and giggling and said, I love the USA.
[1:37:11.520 --> 1:37:19.520]  And yeah, that used to be something that we saw such patriotism from every athlete.
[1:37:19.520 --> 1:37:28.520]  And now you can see how weary a lot of Americans are of seeing their fellow countrymen become
[1:37:28.520 --> 1:37:29.520]  anti-American.
[1:37:29.520 --> 1:37:36.520]  So when they're seeing her represent their country the way everyone else who loves their
[1:37:36.520 --> 1:37:39.520]  country feels, you're seeing that clip go viral now.
[1:37:39.520 --> 1:37:40.520]  Absolutely.
[1:37:40.520 --> 1:37:42.520]  In fact, guys, I wanted to play the full clip.
[1:37:42.520 --> 1:37:45.520]  Can we get the full clip and play the rest of it next time where I had those words to
[1:37:45.520 --> 1:37:46.520]  say thanks?
[1:37:46.520 --> 1:37:50.520]  Now, since you mentioned it, we do have the Mike Lindell clip, right?
[1:37:50.520 --> 1:37:51.520]  Okay, great.
[1:37:51.520 --> 1:37:53.520]  Here's the clip that you saw during the break.
[1:37:53.520 --> 1:37:56.520]  Some stations don't, you know, carry those ads so they didn't see it.
[1:37:56.520 --> 1:37:58.520]  We'll go ahead and roll what you wanted to respond to.
[1:37:58.520 --> 1:37:59.520]  Here's Mike Lindell.
[1:37:59.520 --> 1:38:02.520]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell.

[1:38:11.520 --> 1:38:13.520]  efforts to bring the truth forward.

[1:39:18.520 --> 1:39:20.520]  But yeah, that's a whole other story.
[1:39:20.520 --> 1:39:26.520]  Fox, after he spent 50-something million dollars with them over the years, 50-something million dollars,
[1:39:26.520 --> 1:39:34.520]  would not, a made American company would not run that ad for a cyber symposium to question the election
[1:39:34.520 --> 1:39:40.520]  when we have hundreds of videos of all the Democrats questioning voting machines and questioning companies.
[1:39:40.520 --> 1:39:42.520]  Whether they're right or wrong, people have a right to do that.
[1:39:42.520 --> 1:39:44.520]  This fascinates me.
[1:39:44.520 --> 1:39:52.520]  Why would Fox take down an ad for a symposium that is going to explore truth about the election?
[1:39:52.520 --> 1:39:55.520]  Let's get to the bottom of what really happened with the election.
[1:39:55.520 --> 1:39:56.520]  Here's the thing.
[1:39:56.520 --> 1:40:00.520]  We know Fox News is in a huge lawsuit with Dominion.
[1:40:00.520 --> 1:40:04.520]  Dominion voting systems is suing Fox out the wazoo.
[1:40:04.520 --> 1:40:15.520]  Now, if you're being sued by Dominion, wouldn't you want to get all the proof you could that Dominion did commit fraud?
[1:40:15.520 --> 1:40:17.520]  Then you would win the lawsuit, right?
[1:40:17.520 --> 1:40:25.520]  But for some reason, Fox is shirking back like crazy, banning an ad for a symposium that's going to look into election fraud.
[1:40:25.520 --> 1:40:27.520]  Well, I mean, I want to be clear here.
[1:40:27.520 --> 1:40:29.520]  I didn't go the angle.
[1:40:29.520 --> 1:40:32.520]  We've covered it some of Dominion itself.
[1:40:32.520 --> 1:40:35.520]  The truth is, any of these voting machines hackers can get into it.
[1:40:35.520 --> 1:40:38.520]  And so I think, and Robert Barnes is on next hour.
[1:40:38.520 --> 1:40:41.520]  He's an advisor to Trump and actually worked on the election.
[1:40:41.520 --> 1:40:44.520]  He early on said, I think Dominion's a red herring.
[1:40:44.520 --> 1:40:51.520]  It's the ballot stuffing with the suitcases under the table, pulling them out, running them over and over again, and the car showing up in the middle of the night.
[1:40:51.520 --> 1:40:53.520]  That's not a hack by Dominion doing that.
[1:40:53.520 --> 1:40:55.520]  That is people feeding them into the machine.
[1:40:55.520 --> 1:40:57.520]  That's where we caught them.
[1:40:57.520 --> 1:40:59.520]  Now, sure, did Dominion maybe do that?
[1:40:59.520 --> 1:41:01.520]  Do these voting machine companies do things?
[1:41:01.520 --> 1:41:06.520]  Maybe can random hackers get in or can other Democrats have codes or Republicans?
[1:41:06.520 --> 1:41:07.520]  Absolutely.
[1:41:07.520 --> 1:41:11.520]  These things are wide open to hacking and it's very legitimate to have a symposium with hackers.
[1:41:11.520 --> 1:41:15.520]  They've done these in Las Vegas as well to show how these machines are wide open.
[1:41:15.520 --> 1:41:18.520]  And so again, yes, they're trying.
[1:41:18.520 --> 1:41:21.520]  Overall, Fox News is to suppress us.
[1:41:21.520 --> 1:41:22.520]  What do you think?
[1:41:22.520 --> 1:41:27.520]  Well, I think they're just so afraid of more lawsuits from my experience within Fox.
[1:41:27.520 --> 1:41:35.520]  They're constantly trying to do everything they can to avoid a lawsuit, which is so ironic that then they get hit with the whammy of a lawsuit.
[1:41:35.520 --> 1:41:40.520]  But here's the thing, a good voting machine, it can't be hacked into like that.
[1:41:40.520 --> 1:41:44.520]  And I've tried to do coverage on this, which Fox shot down.
[1:41:44.520 --> 1:41:53.520]  But the state of Texas said in January of 2020, I have the paperwork on this state of Texas Secretary of State,
[1:41:53.520 --> 1:41:58.520]  to office saying we will prohibit Dominion from being used in Texas.
[1:41:58.520 --> 1:41:59.520]  That's right, they've been decertified.
[1:41:59.520 --> 1:42:04.520]  Yeah, because we see how it is, it can be hacked into.
[1:42:04.520 --> 1:42:05.520]  Okay.
[1:42:05.520 --> 1:42:10.520]  Meanwhile, there's other voting systems that are more effective.
[1:42:10.520 --> 1:42:18.520]  In Harris County, they actually use the Hart inner civic software where you cannot run a ballot through multiple times.
[1:42:18.520 --> 1:42:23.520]  Hart doesn't allow that election systems and software machines.
[1:42:23.520 --> 1:42:24.520]  That's another brand.
[1:42:24.520 --> 1:42:26.520]  With them, you can.
[1:42:26.520 --> 1:42:31.520]  In fact, one one big story I tried to cover with Fox that they shot down.
[1:42:31.520 --> 1:42:38.520]  The Harris County commissioners court was voting on which which election machines to use.
[1:42:38.520 --> 1:42:51.520]  And there there was cell phone video shot by some Harris County officials when the election systems and software people came to Harris County to demonstrate their machines.
[1:42:51.520 --> 1:42:55.520]  And in Harris County said, hey, if you run about through twice, is it going to register twice?
[1:42:55.520 --> 1:42:58.520]  And the guy said, yeah, hold on, let's come back and talk about that.
[1:42:58.520 --> 1:42:59.520]  Okay.
[1:42:59.520 --> 1:43:07.520]  One of the products that I'm very proud of, I don't talk enough about because there's so many amazing essential oils and ingredients in it.
[1:43:07.520 --> 1:43:11.520]  It takes a long time to break down the product because it's a complex product.
[1:43:11.520 --> 1:43:17.520]  A lot of the sprays you put in your mouth for your throat and lungs are really thin.
[1:43:17.520 --> 1:43:21.520]  It's a little bit of alcohol if you wanted to essential oils, not our lung cleanse.
[1:43:21.520 --> 1:43:28.520]  It's got a long list of the highest quality essential oils and ingredients in it.
[1:43:28.520 --> 1:43:32.520]  You take a few sprays in your mouth, lightly inhaled.
[1:43:32.520 --> 1:43:38.520]  And it just does so much for me when I've got allergies or when my throat is tired.
[1:43:38.520 --> 1:43:40.520]  It's just very, very soothing.
[1:43:40.520 --> 1:43:46.520]  And it's just one more thing for you and your family to have in your arsenal during these insane times.
[1:43:46.520 --> 1:43:52.520]  So get your lung cleanse discounted at infowarstore.com and get yourself and your family prepared.

[1:46:00.520 --> 1:46:07.520]  It is through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told.
[1:46:07.520 --> 1:46:14.520]  And the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses, which is why fluoridated water is a big problem.
[1:46:14.520 --> 1:46:21.520]  Consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland and shuts down its natural functions.
[1:46:21.520 --> 1:46:24.520]  Natural functions which have been known for millennia.
[1:46:24.520 --> 1:46:27.520]  The Hindu chakras align with the endocrine system.
[1:46:27.520 --> 1:46:30.520]  The chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye.
[1:46:30.520 --> 1:46:40.520]  Also described as the seat of the soul, the pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness and otherwise unseen dimensions of reality.
[1:46:40.520 --> 1:46:45.520]  Fluoride free water is essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy.
[1:46:45.520 --> 1:46:54.520]  Our water filtration systems with the proper filters will keep your drinking water fluoride free and the pro pure shower head will seal the deal.

[1:47:19.520 --> 1:47:34.520]  No one knows what it's like to be the bad man. To be the sad man behind the blue eyes.
[1:47:34.520 --> 1:47:39.520]  No one knows what it's like to be hated.
[1:47:39.520 --> 1:47:43.520]  Ivory Hecker is our guest. He's a whistleblowing Fox reporter out of Houston.
[1:47:43.520 --> 1:47:52.520]  When they wouldn't let her talk to medical doctors and a lot of people don't want reporters talking about election fraud or about machines not having integrity.
[1:47:52.520 --> 1:47:57.520]  But we have all these states that these certified a lot of different voting machines.
[1:47:57.520 --> 1:48:07.520]  My issue with statements made of we have the proof that some people said that the head people at Dominion gave orders to still the election.
[1:48:07.520 --> 1:48:10.520]  Well, you can't prove that and I never saw the proof and it's never been brought forward.
[1:48:10.520 --> 1:48:16.520]  Instead of hey this thing leaks like a sieve anybody can get into it people can run ballots through it.
[1:48:16.520 --> 1:48:18.520]  We've got a problem with this company and others.
[1:48:18.520 --> 1:48:24.520]  That's legitimate to say that there are problems in the voting system and then you can prove that.
[1:48:24.520 --> 1:48:29.520]  But what happened was people said they have the smoking guns on that which then couldn't be delivered.
[1:48:29.520 --> 1:48:37.520]  And so then the whole thing falls apart and I've seen intelligence operations at eight Chan who constantly put out stuff that's too good to be true.
[1:48:37.520 --> 1:48:41.520]  Just like the Q stuff so that we end up getting our asses handed to us.
[1:48:41.520 --> 1:48:47.520]  Instead of like hey I don't think any voting system that can easily be hacked into or you can run multiple ballots through should be certified.
[1:48:47.520 --> 1:48:50.520]  And that's why a whole bunch of states have not certified Dominion.
[1:48:50.520 --> 1:48:55.520]  So rather than defending Dominion, I'm not scared of lawsuits or any of this crap.
[1:48:55.520 --> 1:48:57.520]  I as a voter as a citizen have a right to ask questions.
[1:48:57.520 --> 1:48:59.520]  That's not my issue.
[1:48:59.520 --> 1:49:00.520]  I'm not defending Dominion.
[1:49:00.520 --> 1:49:04.520]  I'm simply saying the attack needs to be on the integrity of the systems themselves.
[1:49:04.520 --> 1:49:07.520]  Not try to claim oh the executives did this because you can't prove that.
[1:49:07.520 --> 1:49:08.520]  That's designed to fail.
[1:49:08.520 --> 1:49:09.520]  Right.
[1:49:09.520 --> 1:49:17.520]  I never received any evidence that executives at the top of these voting companies designed them to fail.
[1:49:17.520 --> 1:49:28.520]  But I do have cell phone video filmed by Harris County officials which Harris County is where Houston is located where I'm located as a reporter.
[1:49:28.520 --> 1:49:35.520]  When election systems and software came to Harris County to demonstrate their software and say pick us.
[1:49:35.520 --> 1:49:41.520]  We want your voting machines in the third most populous county in America to be election systems and software.
[1:49:41.520 --> 1:49:50.520]  So when they did the demonstration of the machines Harris County officials asked if you have a ballot and you feed it through twice is it going to register.
[1:49:50.520 --> 1:49:58.520]  Two votes one ballot registering two or more votes votes depending on how many times you feed it through.
[1:49:58.520 --> 1:50:07.520]  And the man from election systems and software said yes yes it will register as more than one vote one ballot can register for multiple votes.
[1:50:07.520 --> 1:50:15.520]  And so these Harris County officials were very alarmed by that they brought the video to me the reporter to get it out to the public because.
[1:50:15.520 --> 1:50:22.520]  Harris County officials were about to vote on maybe using this these voting machines in Harris County.
[1:50:22.520 --> 1:50:27.520]  And I was dumbfounded when I pitched this video to my bosses and they said we don't want to.
[1:50:27.520 --> 1:50:36.520]  You know they basically they didn't even say we don't want to they actually acted like they didn't hear me and assigned me I think to a road rage story.
[1:50:36.520 --> 1:50:47.520]  So just any any election pitch that I made they they would pretty much throw it out if it questioned the integrity of the election.
[1:50:47.520 --> 1:50:59.520]  If the if a story at all shed a light on possible opportunity for fraud then my bosses were not interested in covering that.
[1:50:59.520 --> 1:51:07.520]  In early voting early 2020 they let me cover some stories on double voting that was happening.
[1:51:07.520 --> 1:51:12.520]  And then the narrative shifted to to elections are bulletproof.
[1:51:12.520 --> 1:51:15.520]  And you know even though that wasn't the truth.
[1:51:15.520 --> 1:51:18.520]  So what you're saying is it's what we already see in the media when everybody starts repeating.
[1:51:18.520 --> 1:51:24.520]  We've all seen the videos where it'll show like one screen they're saying something another screen they were repeated some of there's 20 screens all saying the same thing.
[1:51:24.520 --> 1:51:28.520]  Once the narrative gets going then that's what you're supposed to follow.
[1:51:28.520 --> 1:51:40.520]  That's what I learned and it was very alarming to me you know elections are one of the most sacred things that you can cover as a journalist and hear my bosses were looking for anything else to cover.
[1:51:40.520 --> 1:51:53.520]  When I knew for fact that our viewers were extremely anxious about the election and they wanted all the election coverage they get instead my bosses are diverting coverage to anything else.
[1:51:53.520 --> 1:52:07.520]  You could think of I also tried to present the documentation from the Secretary of State's Office of Texas saying their investigators found in January 2020 that Dominion was a no go because it was susceptible to fraud.
[1:52:07.520 --> 1:52:14.520]  My bosses again acted like they didn't hear me and assigned me to cover sidewalk chalk art instead.
[1:52:14.520 --> 1:52:23.520]  I said I can't keep doing this this is the I'm being used as a tool of narrative a tool of distraction from the real issues.
[1:52:23.520 --> 1:52:33.520]  Well let's talk about nuts and bolts because info wars is an example for independent media and its formation though we've been around a long time as we were able to form before this happened and able to survive thanks to listeners.
[1:52:33.520 --> 1:52:42.520]  But with what you're doing without getting into all the details I guess you're going to get some sponsors you're going to start putting out some of your reports you're going to try to get other whistleblowers on and then just.
[1:52:42.520 --> 1:52:54.520]  Let me start doing independent online reporting and then I think then you should obviously try to get it with project very talks you get it on with with us just really create a new ecosystem of media I think the key.
[1:52:54.520 --> 1:53:06.520]  Absolutely we all we all gotta it's all up to these independent journalists now you know to get to the bottom of what's really going on because these big news corporations are compromised obviously by their special interest.
[1:53:06.520 --> 1:53:13.520]  And so the answer is okay they sold out they got bought off and the rest of reporters went along with it but everybody that isn't part of this go start your own thing.
[1:53:13.520 --> 1:53:22.520]  Yeah and there's enough independent hubs out there to promote it and enough people that care that when they amplify this nothing's going to stop it so they can't stop us all ivory.
[1:53:22.520 --> 1:53:28.520]  They cannot and you know I don't have a lot of fear so I'm going to be getting out there covering some of the stories that matter.
[1:53:28.520 --> 1:53:42.520]  The first story I'm tackling is on vaccines and some of the adverse events it's so sad that these people with adverse reactions either death or serious physical harm are being ignored and.
[1:53:42.520 --> 1:53:49.520]  And you know doctors don't know how to how to diagnose what's happened and then.
[1:53:49.520 --> 1:54:00.520]  You know a lot of people feel like there's a lack of justice and their stories are being suppressed because news outlets want as many people to get vaccinated as possible.
[1:54:00.520 --> 1:54:11.520]  And imagine where are they now you could go back all the people that are already in the news people that are not in the news who've gotten sick or died their family can talk about it and then update people to I mean that they do not want that out.
[1:54:11.520 --> 1:54:24.520]  Yeah my boss said that that she just didn't want to discourage anyone from from getting vaccinated because you're a hero you're for it you're going to make people do it it's going to be a vaccine passport so we can't let people know it's hurting them.
[1:54:24.520 --> 1:54:26.520]  Wow how evil is that.
[1:54:26.520 --> 1:54:38.520]  Yeah she said oh there's risks for everything you know and it was just it was pretty horrifying to receive strict orders do not let people know about these deaths after vaccination like look we we got to be transparent.
[1:54:38.520 --> 1:54:44.520]  Look at that camera right there because we're live now but we'll soon be off I'm going to archive this video they want to go viral.
[1:54:44.520 --> 1:54:50.520]  Your boss told you at Fox I mean don't your own words to not cover up illness and death that's big.
[1:54:50.520 --> 1:54:58.520]  Yeah my boss at Fox told me do not report the thousands of deaths after vaccination.
[1:54:58.520 --> 1:55:01.520]  What is that what are we hiding.
[1:55:01.520 --> 1:55:03.520]  What else did they say.
[1:55:03.520 --> 1:55:19.520]  Well they said we don't you know we don't want to discourage anyone from getting vaccinated and then they later call the whole meeting of of our whole day side crew to figure out how to get that ticker up of more people vaccinated.
[1:55:19.520 --> 1:55:27.520]  How can we craft our coverage to convict convince our viewers to get their children vaccinated.
[1:55:27.520 --> 1:55:32.520]  My boss was saying how can we get to our black audience get them to get vaccinated.
[1:55:32.520 --> 1:55:35.520]  And then her because that directive comes down get the black people.
[1:55:35.520 --> 1:55:36.520]  Right.
[1:55:36.520 --> 1:55:39.520]  They never thinking maybe this is Bill Gates and the eugenicists already populate.
[1:55:39.520 --> 1:55:48.520]  Yeah it was interesting how can we get to the black people and then our one of our black reporters said well all my black friends are vaccinated my white friends aren't.
[1:55:48.520 --> 1:55:50.520]  So is this really black versus white.
[1:55:50.520 --> 1:56:02.520]  And I said look I think it's just a lot of people who they've they've got these questions that aren't being answered at the same time the bosses were calling this meeting.
[1:56:02.520 --> 1:56:12.520]  There also had been a breaking news out of the CDC that they were no longer going to report all breakthrough cases of COVID-19.
[1:56:12.520 --> 1:56:22.520]  Five more minutes with us let's talk about that speaking of independent media we are funded by viewers like you and I would love to be able to sponsor somebody like this young lady to go out and do more reports maybe we will.
[1:56:22.520 --> 1:56:34.520]  But the point is is we are sponsoring a lot of folks behind the scenes and even know their names or you do know their names you don't know who we're sponsoring to just fight the globalist not just as the black sheep of info wars but also through other folks out there that have not been

[1:59:07.520 --> 1:59:23.520]  and so even though it seems like the globalist are winning the truth is they've had to come out in the open to attack human freedom because they're actually losing we have forced them out in the open so as bad as these times are a lot of negative things are
[1:59:23.520 --> 1:59:39.520]  about to happen realize humanity is winning you've got to trust in the plan of God and trust in the plan of God's justice that is invincible that is ethereal timeless and unstoppable so don't trust in man trust in God to lead God
[1:59:39.520 --> 1:59:57.520]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:00:09.520 --> 2:00:23.520]  some TV
[2:00:23.520 --> 2:00:44.520]  it's all gone crazy well my wife returns from taking my little girl to school she got me to perspiration she tries to keep her cool she says don't mess it don't get no better there's gonna come a day
[2:00:44.520 --> 2:00:55.520]  every heckers with us for five more minutes and I'm really excited about what you're doing a fellow Texan down here fighting hard here on the Alex show show any other points you'd like to make the listeners
[2:00:55.520 --> 2:01:11.520]  well I mean like I was saying the CDC said that they're not going to report all breakthrough cases of COVID-19 anymore meaning people who have been vaccinated is the vaccine really working we're not going to fully tell you and then my boss is at five
[2:01:11.520 --> 2:01:27.520]  that's not a good sign when we want to take something experimental but we don't want you to look into it so that is taking down people's trust in the vaccine even more and they're trusting the CDC and in transparency and then Fox is racking their brain about why viewers are resistant
[2:01:27.520 --> 2:01:42.520]  and now you can't get on an airplane soon if you don't we're like whoa I'm really not taking this now yeah it's like why are you why are you guys bribing us to take the shot and then you're now you're gonna try to penalize us from taking the shot
[2:01:42.520 --> 2:02:02.520]  and by the way my co-workers were trickling back into the newsroom and for some reason I wasn't allowed in the newsroom yet but I kept receiving emails from HR to get my shot but anyway so Fox is racking their brains and I said well we need to address the secrecy from the CDC why are they not
[2:02:02.520 --> 2:02:19.520]  going to report all breakthrough cases and our local health officials at least going to do that Fox again ignored my pitch while continuing to rack their brains about how to convince viewers to get vaccinated and I was like look more transparency if anything is going to make people
[2:02:19.520 --> 2:02:33.520]  maybe more likely to get the shot and the box bosses didn't want to hear it but they talked about you know maybe if we do more stories and how you won't get to go back to work if you don't get the shot maybe that'll convince people to get the shot
[2:02:33.520 --> 2:02:47.520]  actually my boss's boss pitched that story he was on the call so it's all about coercion apparently you know I was just sitting there dumbfounded listening to my bosses contrived propaganda don't they get long term coercion blows up in your face that's
[2:02:47.520 --> 2:03:03.520]  gently gently catchy monkey I just I couldn't believe that they that they weren't realizing what you're doing is propaganda I thought I was hired to do journalism and I thought my bosses were journalists but they're pushing propaganda and I had to
[2:03:03.520 --> 2:03:17.520]  define propaganda for my bosses and say this is what you guys are doing in my annual review with Fox this year I said that to them I said you guys are doing propaganda and I'm wondering why and I do want to review this year with you guys let's talk about it and then they
[2:03:17.520 --> 2:03:35.520]  tried to skate away from it and end and the meeting but that's exactly how authoritarian are oh we're looking at you good let's have that oh no we don't want that meeting exactly I said fantastic let's really review this year and anyway so this this all led to me
[2:03:35.520 --> 2:03:49.520]  eventually saying look I'm getting out and I'm going to call you guys out live on air but the latest numbers on breakthrough cases of COVID-19 out of Israel are really fascinating I don't know if you saw those oh yeah
[2:03:49.520 --> 2:04:06.520]  I just looked at at the latest data I was sent is 18,000 COVID cases that were looked at in Israel and 85% of those 18,000 cases were people who had already had the vaccine right okay so I'm getting that data from the it from Israeli
[2:04:06.520 --> 2:04:24.520]  dashboard but then there's a New England Journal of Medicine review of some of that data that that shows a totally different story oh they lie they lie it looks at 1400 healthcare workers only who got the shot and of those of the healthcare workers only
[2:04:24.520 --> 2:04:38.520]  two and a half percent were breakthrough cases of COVID-19 and you just see this massive spin machine going on yes I'm like well can we can we really trust the numbers that get fed to us in the mainstream media or are they selecting handpicking their favorite numbers to make it look
[2:04:38.520 --> 2:04:56.520]  well I also just go off anecdotal and I have a lot of doctor friends and nurse friends it was all BS last year and the hospitals were empty now they're full and people are dying of something and they think it's what's leaching out of those that have been injected ivoryhacker ivoryhacker.com great to see what you're doing we love you thank you so much
[2:04:56.520 --> 2:05:09.520]  you bet we'll be right back with Robert Barnes.

[2:06:18.520 --> 2:06:39.520]  everybody knows the war is over everybody knows the good guys lost everybody knows the fight was fixed the poor stay poor the rich get rich and how it goes
[2:06:39.520 --> 2:06:57.520]  because everybody knows everybody knows everybody knows well joining us is constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes and I want to cover the waterfront with the time we have with him
[2:06:57.520 --> 2:07:20.520]  first off the Supreme Court ruling from 100 years ago plus about forced inoculations that they're hanging their hat on the last Supreme Court Justice he warned of who is the supporter of that Amy Comey Barrett these incredibly insane declarations by Fauci and others that they are getting ready for the forced inoculations you
[2:07:20.520 --> 2:07:36.520]  shouldn't be able to go on a plane an airplane vaccine passports the inside word we've got that Biden is set on August 11 to announce a new lock down that that's not just Jack Pasoby who's incredible sources the gold standard my view but my sources say currently that's the case doesn't
[2:07:36.520 --> 2:07:53.520]  mean it's going to happen they may back off but this is just a very very dangerous time to be alive but but Robert Barnes my argument here is you may have a Supreme Court ruling that says you can forcibly inoculate people but that ended up not being followed either
[2:07:53.520 --> 2:08:08.520]  but this isn't even an oculation this is a gene therapy system that was never even approved and so for me it's just a no brainer to say no plus they're trying to suppress the illnesses and the numbers and the bears reporting and then you pull back even further
[2:08:08.520 --> 2:08:23.520]  they admit it's a database so what about a medical database to travel the database itself is beyond problematic and they admit forms the core of this global idea they're setting up so as a lawyer just just back of the envelope here what do you
[2:08:23.520 --> 2:08:36.520]  make of this this big power grab this move I told them a year ago they were going to try it now it's here how do we oppose this as Americans because it's already happening in Europe and other areas it's a global move how do we say no to this clear
[2:08:36.520 --> 2:08:52.520]  attorney well lawsuits are coming I'll be filing suits next week some with Bobby Kennedy some with other lawyers will be helping in other lawsuits will be filing lawsuits to prevent the FDA from authorizing this vaccine fully
[2:08:52.520 --> 2:09:07.520]  because they haven't met the requisite test haven't obeyed the citizen petition process that they're supposed to challenging the emergency use authorization component of it their failure to do meaningful informed consent which is a required precondition of its
[2:09:07.520 --> 2:09:22.520]  application particularly for it to continue to emergency use authorization in addition will be filing suit on behalf of employees I or other lawyers that I'm helping in working with will be filing suits on behalf of employees on behalf of soldiers on behalf of parents on
[2:09:22.520 --> 2:09:39.520]  behalf of kids in cases all across the country over the next week and two or two for these people because of these of force of mandates we're seeing mandates by cities mandates by counties mandates by federal government mandates related to soldiers
[2:09:39.520 --> 2:09:53.520]  as well as an attempt to rush the approval of the FDA vaccine a formally and fully and officially and it has to be fought back in the court of law for the government to do so there's major constitutional problems with what they're doing for the FDA to do
[2:09:53.520 --> 2:10:08.520]  so there's major statutory and regulatory and medical ethics problems with what they're doing for employees there's major issues with the Americans with Disabilities Act ADA claims that are forthcoming as well as common law towards a battery that may be applicable
[2:10:08.520 --> 2:10:24.520]  and so we're going to some of the claims are novel some of the claims have never been tested before and you're right the core question is will the courts return to the era of eugenics which was the which had the trilogy of infamy of court cases Jacobson Buck and
[2:10:24.520 --> 2:10:41.520]  Korematsu which said they could do forth vaccinations for sterilizations and forced detention camps or will we return to the post Nuremberg code of 1947 which said informed consent will continue to govern everything related to the medical process and medical profession
[2:10:41.520 --> 2:10:54.520]  and that you have autonomy over your own body because that's what the big question is if the state can control your body if an employer can control your body and dictate your medical care then you no longer have individual freedom in the United States
[2:10:54.520 --> 2:11:12.520]  and what the ADA laws were meant to prevent from occurring that's what the Constitution was meant to stop from occurring that's what the Nuremberg code of 1947 was meant to stop from occurring and so we're going to put the test right to the courts and make the courts make the choice and hopefully they make the right choice and don't return to the
[2:11:12.520 --> 2:11:28.520]  corridor of the era of eugenics which led to such infamous and morally horrific decisions as the buck decision and Robert you've been practicing a long time I've been on there as long 27 years studying history on a scale of one to ten
[2:11:28.520 --> 2:11:44.520]  I mean this is a bum rushing by corporations by the UN by the fortune 100 by big tech the sensor control block treatments force experimental injections I mean it's like they've said let's be as evil as we can let's let's be as bad as we can you're
[2:11:44.520 --> 2:11:59.520]  really smart historian I really respect you why are they being so megalomaniacal why are they trying to out Hitler Hitler why are they trying to be the baddies like this I mean this is just like a desperate insane push now they admit it doesn't work like like
[2:11:59.520 --> 2:12:14.520]  like I was covering last hour 85% of the illnesses in Israel are the vaccinated the majority of deaths are that same thing here they're trying to suppress that Fauci doubles down with a 99% of the deaths haven't had a shot just pulled out of his ass and even Congress finds that out
[2:12:14.520 --> 2:12:30.520]  I mean this is like watching insane gremlins burned down a building or something I mean why are they doing it because they're going to destroy themselves in the process it's already fallen apart I mean I just I just cannot find any even from a criminal criminology
[2:12:30.520 --> 2:12:45.520]  logic because criminals have their own word logic I can understand that I've studied it I don't even find that I mean what is this just existential power grab or wanting to punish the West for not submitting to globalism so they're going to poison this I mean Saudi Arabia is at 18%
[2:12:45.520 --> 2:13:01.520]  many other Indians at 78% they go oh they're wonderful countries America's bad at 50% it's it's all just lies everything is a fraud I mean it clearly to me it is an assault on America where does this come from what is it
[2:13:01.520 --> 2:13:16.520]  it's the biggest power grab in the history of Western democracies is what it is it's what they've always wanted if the state can control your body the state controls everything I mean you are you're just one step away from pure chattel slavery and that's the goal and the
[2:13:16.520 --> 2:13:31.520]  the fact they're willing to pursue this and push this for a vaccine that is showing major problems as you know Iceland your Balter Israel three of the countries with the highest vaccination rates in the world and what are they talking about or actually doing lockdowns
[2:13:31.520 --> 2:13:47.520]  because they're which is an implicit admission and acknowledgement that the vaccine doesn't even prevent transmission which is the only legal thin pretext they have for trying to institute this requirement in the first place and they're doing so for a family of viruses
[2:13:47.520 --> 2:14:05.520]  coronaviruses for which there has never been a successful vaccine in medical history and they've been trying over over a century to attain it or achieve it and littered with the trying to rush a vaccine despite the fact that rush vaccines have a particularly pernicious
[2:14:05.520 --> 2:14:20.520]  history of failure including I mean 2016 attempts at the dang vaccine led to 900 children dying but Robert Robert that's what I'm saying is I watched the Dean of Harvard in front of Congress say it's always failed it killed the animals it
[2:14:20.520 --> 2:14:32.520]  never worked now Bill Gates took it over and I thought he was anti Gates I watched the whole thing goes but now it's going to work it's like some weird gambler that's lost everything and selling their house but why would they endanger their
[2:14:32.520 --> 2:14:44.520]  whole power structure like this I mean they've just they've destroyed themselves it's killing all these people and everybody's waking up why would they do this because they saw the success over the last year for the most part they
[2:14:44.520 --> 2:15:02.520]  I mean over the last year they did mass house arrest deprive people of their ability to work deprive people their ability to run their own business deprive the people of the sending their kids to public school deprive the ability to simply travel to meet family deprive the ability to do things like weddings and funerals and they got
[2:15:02.520 --> 2:15:15.520]  more resistance than they wanted but not enough resistance in the in either the court of public opinion or the courts of law and so they're going to keep going for this they see this as their grand opportunity their window of opportunity for a massive power grab
[2:15:15.520 --> 2:15:28.520]  and because so many of the institutional stakeholders are invested in it doctors are invested in it pharmaceutical industry is invested in it the legal profession is invested in it government officials are invested in it big tech is making billions off of it.
[2:15:28.520 --> 2:15:34.520]  Wall Street is getting rich off of it the Fed is getting to experiment with modern monetary theory with it.
[2:15:34.520 --> 2:15:46.520]  Too many of the stakeholders are complicit in it and it's going to require mass public resistance mass court public opinion mass court legal legal litigation to try to put it into it.
[2:15:46.520 --> 2:15:58.520]  Absolutely this is their big assault this is their big move they're going for broke on every front the world government card the global ID card the depopulation card all of it will be right back with Robert Barnes stay with us.

[2:19:07.520 --> 2:19:11.520]  It's great last caller. I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[2:19:11.520 --> 2:19:15.520]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting,
[2:19:15.520 --> 2:19:19.520]  the moralization, and absurdity. It's like we're living in a twilight zone, man.
[2:19:19.520 --> 2:19:22.520]  All right. Eric in New Hampshire. Eric, thanks for calling. Go ahead.
[2:19:22.520 --> 2:19:26.520]  Hey, Alex. Thanks for taking my call. If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for the point of the product.
[2:19:26.520 --> 2:19:31.520]  The X2 Group does wonders. They recommend it to everybody here on the fence about it.
[2:19:31.520 --> 2:19:34.520]  Get off the fence. Get the product. Support the info ward.
[2:19:34.520 --> 2:19:37.520]  Tyler in Maine. You're on the year. Thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[2:19:37.520 --> 2:19:39.520]  Hey, Alex. It's great to be on with you. It's an honor.
[2:19:39.520 --> 2:19:41.520]  Honored talk to you. Awesome.
[2:19:41.520 --> 2:19:47.520]  So, first thing I wanted to do was say I love the products. Alpha Power, even at 29.
[2:19:47.520 --> 2:19:51.520]  If you ask my better half, she loves it and it helps in the bedroom.
[2:19:51.520 --> 2:19:53.520]  So, just number one for a few years later.
[2:19:53.520 --> 2:19:55.520]  It definitely works. It's not a joke.
[2:19:55.520 --> 2:20:03.520]  Absolutely.
[2:20:03.520 --> 2:20:29.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:29.520 --> 2:20:40.520]  Robert Barnes is our guest here today.
[2:20:40.520 --> 2:20:43.520]  I want to get into the election fraud.
[2:20:43.520 --> 2:20:45.520]  Where Trump's going.
[2:20:45.520 --> 2:20:48.520]  What he thinks the best information on that is right now.
[2:20:48.520 --> 2:20:51.520]  Next segment, beginning back to the so-called vaccines.
[2:20:51.520 --> 2:20:53.520]  Experimental shots.
[2:20:53.520 --> 2:21:01.520]  Why did they choose a placebo to bring in a regime of forced inoculation or a regime of global ID that Klaus Schwab talks about?
[2:21:01.520 --> 2:21:12.520]  Why did they get something that in all the studies they did under other names at the National Institutes of Health and the CDC under Fauci, like at UT nine years ago,
[2:21:12.520 --> 2:21:18.520]  and a U.S. government initiative that found do not try to create a vaccine for the spike protein.
[2:21:18.520 --> 2:21:24.520]  That will basically kill mammoths, proceed with extreme caution in humans.
[2:21:24.520 --> 2:21:26.520]  That's in the UT report.
[2:21:26.520 --> 2:21:34.520]  Why would they, I mean, again, I get it, but get the power, get the control, make you buy vaccines, make you be tracked, create the world ID.
[2:21:34.520 --> 2:21:38.520]  But then right up front, have the force shot, hurt people and kill them.
[2:21:38.520 --> 2:21:40.520]  I guess to go ahead and manage the cover up.
[2:21:40.520 --> 2:21:46.520]  And if enough people get hurt, then I guess all the autistic kids, nobody cared about them, they got away with that.
[2:21:46.520 --> 2:21:50.520]  So, I mean, this is about corrupting the lawyers, corrupting the doctors, corrupting the media.
[2:21:50.520 --> 2:21:52.520]  So when it comes out, they killed a bunch of people.
[2:21:52.520 --> 2:21:56.520]  They can say, see, like Cuomo, we can put you in jail anytime we want.
[2:21:56.520 --> 2:22:00.520]  I think that's why they went ahead and started putting a poison out up front.
[2:22:00.520 --> 2:22:03.520]  Because if I was really trying to kill everybody, I'm not as evil as them.
[2:22:03.520 --> 2:22:08.520]  I would have it be a placebo up front to then set the precedent to then kill later.
[2:22:08.520 --> 2:22:13.520]  But no, no, no, no, just get it out up front, get everybody used to it, control the media, control the message,
[2:22:13.520 --> 2:22:18.520]  and just get everything you want at once in a blitzkrieg attack to overwhelm us.
[2:22:18.520 --> 2:22:21.520]  Is that what's happening here with this Total War, Robert Barnes?
[2:22:21.520 --> 2:22:26.520]  Yes, and they also know that they are at very little risk of public exposure.
[2:22:26.520 --> 2:22:29.520]  Because the media is in the bag for them, in institutional media.
[2:22:29.520 --> 2:22:35.520]  The medical profession has been told if that if they give out more than five medical exemptions,
[2:22:35.520 --> 2:22:41.520]  in California, the doctor will be subject to immediate licensure review, may lose his medical license.
[2:22:41.520 --> 2:22:46.520]  Just look for a doctor. If you tell people to not get the vaccine and something goes wrong,
[2:22:46.520 --> 2:22:52.520]  you can get sued into oblivion and lose your license and be defamed and doxxed and ruined in your career.
[2:22:52.520 --> 2:22:57.520]  On the other hand, if you tell them to get the vaccine, you'll have big farmers backing, governments backing,
[2:22:57.520 --> 2:23:00.520]  you can't be sued, no risk for your licensure.
[2:23:00.520 --> 2:23:05.520]  So all the skin in the game is on the side of the stakeholders, is on the side of forcing the vaccine.
[2:23:05.520 --> 2:23:10.520]  The same with big pharma. They get to reap all the rewards of their vaccine.
[2:23:10.520 --> 2:23:15.520]  They experience none of the risk because they cannot be sued for anything they did wrong in this capacity,
[2:23:15.520 --> 2:23:19.520]  unless you can prove criminal willfulness, which is almost impossible.
[2:23:19.520 --> 2:23:24.520]  Same with the government actor. The government actors know that they get to control and cabin how people review this.
[2:23:24.520 --> 2:23:33.520]  Just look as an example, that young girl who experienced, who's now in a wheelchair because of going through the vaccine trials,
[2:23:33.520 --> 2:23:39.520]  and her doctors are trying to claim something else caused it when it's obvious nothing else could have caused it.
[2:23:39.520 --> 2:23:40.520]  So that's that.
[2:23:40.520 --> 2:23:46.520]  And what about the woman in Hawaii who took the vaccine? The doctors admitted almost killed her.
[2:23:46.520 --> 2:23:50.520]  So she tries to get a vaccine waiver to go to the university. She's already enrolled in.
[2:23:50.520 --> 2:23:55.520]  They kick her out and say, we don't even care if you have a doctor's waiver. I mean, wow.
[2:23:55.520 --> 2:24:00.520]  Well, and it gets even worse. I'm hearing reports that if you suffer an injury from the vaccine,
[2:24:00.520 --> 2:24:07.520]  your employer's not covering it and your insurer's not covering it because they're saying that this is outside of their coverage.
[2:24:07.520 --> 2:24:14.520]  So they're often getting people to sign waivers. They don't realize they're signing as part of the vaccine process or employment process.
[2:24:14.520 --> 2:24:17.520]  So you're going to have people that have nobody has any risk.
[2:24:17.520 --> 2:24:22.520]  So, Barnes, what do we do? There's no risk. The globalist control the planet. They're killing us. They're attacking us.
[2:24:22.520 --> 2:24:29.520]  They're putting us in a medical gulag. What do we do when faced with something like this? Civil disobedience?
[2:24:29.520 --> 2:24:31.520]  Well, I think you fight back at every level you can.
[2:24:31.520 --> 2:24:37.520]  Whether that's fighting back in the court of public opinion is critical and essential and should not be understated or underrated at all.
[2:24:37.520 --> 2:24:44.520]  Just look at Canada. There was enough pushback in some of the provinces in Canada that now they're talking about reexamining it.
[2:24:44.520 --> 2:24:51.520]  Even the Alberta, the head of health who had been subpoenaed for certain information was able to get out of that subpoena.
[2:24:51.520 --> 2:24:58.520]  But what was her response to all of that from the court of public opinion, the court of law say, hey, we're going to start treating this like the flu instead.
[2:24:58.520 --> 2:25:05.520]  We're going to take away a lot of these mandates. Exactly. We've got to put pressure on every one of these rats.
[2:25:05.520 --> 2:25:09.520]  That's exactly right. The only way you get a rat to run is to put pressure on a rat.
[2:25:09.520 --> 2:25:13.520]  So that's why there has to be pressure at every level, court of public opinion, court of law.
[2:25:13.520 --> 2:25:16.520]  Every way that we can fight back, we have to fight back.
[2:25:16.520 --> 2:25:22.520]  Part of why what happened in the Connie Buck case is that she had nobody to represent her in the Buck versus Bell.
[2:25:22.520 --> 2:25:29.520]  There was nobody to defend her. There was nobody to vindicate her. In fact, her only lawyer was actually working for the other side.
[2:25:29.520 --> 2:25:34.520]  So we have to continue to fight back by every means possible. And is it uphill? Absolutely.
[2:25:34.520 --> 2:25:39.520]  Are the odds stacked against us? No doubt. But that has never been a reason to quit or forfeit.
[2:25:39.520 --> 2:25:46.520]  I mean, the Texas is the state of Texas because a group of folks from Tennessee decided they weren't going to quit no matter the odds.
[2:25:46.520 --> 2:25:50.520]  And we have to have the same approach that it comes to this.
[2:25:50.520 --> 2:26:00.520]  Expanding on that, how do they think they're going to get away with a forced inoculation that kills all these people?
[2:26:00.520 --> 2:26:05.520]  Because it doesn't matter if they control the media. Everybody's going to anecdotally warn their friends and family.
[2:26:05.520 --> 2:26:09.520]  And all they're going to do is start a giant war. I mean, why would they gamble?
[2:26:09.520 --> 2:26:12.520]  I mean, I get they're tired of waiting. They want world government.
[2:26:12.520 --> 2:26:15.520]  But why would this power structure gamble like this?
[2:26:15.520 --> 2:26:22.520]  And how do we put pressure on them to stop? And who are the key people to put pressure on?
[2:26:22.520 --> 2:26:25.520]  It's the court of public opinion to get people educated.
[2:26:25.520 --> 2:26:30.520]  I mean, look at how much big tech has colluded on this to suppress even people like Brett Weinstein.
[2:26:30.520 --> 2:26:35.520]  I mean, for example, he had one of the most prominent pro vaccine people in the world.
[2:26:35.520 --> 2:26:39.520]  And I won't try to pronunciate his name as doctor. I just remember Dr. Greek.
[2:26:39.520 --> 2:26:45.520]  But as the guy's a Bill Gates guy who worked at the Gates Foundation, even he said from the get go,
[2:26:45.520 --> 2:26:51.520]  it's a bad idea to try to do a mass vaccination campaign like this for this particular virus.
[2:26:51.520 --> 2:26:58.520]  Because what it's likely going to do is create more effective, more pernicious variants that will not only escape
[2:26:58.520 --> 2:27:05.520]  and elude and evade the virus, but will also actually increase transmission levels and viral load levels,
[2:27:05.520 --> 2:27:09.520]  which is precisely what the Cape Cod study.
[2:27:09.520 --> 2:27:12.520]  Sure. That's the discovery of HIV Nobel Prize winner. He said that everybody a year ago.
[2:27:12.520 --> 2:27:17.520]  Now it's been proven, which I think Gates and them were planning because then they go, oh, you need more shots.
[2:27:17.520 --> 2:27:19.520]  And that Gates said last year, oh, you're going to need boosters.
[2:27:19.520 --> 2:27:22.520]  I mean, I think they've worked in this whole thing out.
[2:27:22.520 --> 2:27:26.520]  Well, I mean, from a big farmer perspective, oh, no doubt when we talked about a year ago,
[2:27:26.520 --> 2:27:28.520]  we said the end game here is forced vaccination.
[2:27:28.520 --> 2:27:32.520]  They're going to make life so miserable that people beg for the vaccine.
[2:27:32.520 --> 2:27:36.520]  And if they don't get enough people begging for the vaccine, they're going to compel it and force it on people.
[2:27:36.520 --> 2:27:40.520]  And I would note this is a racially discriminatory policy.
[2:27:40.520 --> 2:27:44.520]  What the mayor of New York did in announcing that vaccine mandate,
[2:27:44.520 --> 2:27:48.520]  disparately impacts African Americans and Latinos in New York City.
[2:27:48.520 --> 2:27:55.520]  It's racial segregation, just disguised and rewritten as vaccine segregation,
[2:27:55.520 --> 2:27:58.520]  but it's no less pernicious and no less of a racially discriminatory.
[2:27:58.520 --> 2:28:02.520]  That's what the mayor of Boston is saying now too, so maybe people are waking up.
[2:28:02.520 --> 2:28:03.520]  Exactly.
[2:28:03.520 --> 2:28:09.520]  We just need a broad coalition of everybody who's on the same side on this issue, right or left.
[2:28:09.520 --> 2:28:16.520]  That's where Bobby Kennedy has been critical on this, other in the children's health defense, others across the ideological political spectrum
[2:28:16.520 --> 2:28:21.520]  to recognize this is an attempt to recreate the eugenics era of judicial precedence.
[2:28:21.520 --> 2:28:27.520]  That's why they keep citing Jacobson, the foundational decision for eugenics in American courts.
[2:28:27.520 --> 2:28:32.520]  Buck decision was the number one decision cited by the Nazis to justify their eugenics.
[2:28:32.520 --> 2:28:35.520]  The Nuremberg code is supposed to say, never again.
[2:28:35.520 --> 2:28:40.520]  And the only way we fight back is we never forgive, never forget, and hold the line.
[2:28:40.520 --> 2:28:44.520]  And the way we have to hold that line is fighting back by every means available.
[2:28:44.520 --> 2:28:49.520]  And Robert, we will go to break down and come back with other news, but wasn't that proven by now the vaccinated,
[2:28:49.520 --> 2:28:52.520]  they say are the ones getting sick, the one spreading a new booster,
[2:28:52.520 --> 2:28:56.520]  because they're the schmucks that went along with it, they're going to keep getting targeted.
[2:28:56.520 --> 2:28:58.520]  Submission is death, resistance is life.
[2:28:58.520 --> 2:29:27.520]  We'll arrive back with Robert Barnes, stay with us.
[2:29:28.520 --> 2:29:57.520]  Thank you.
[2:29:58.520 --> 2:30:08.520]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology that criminologists all agree on.
[2:30:08.520 --> 2:30:13.520]  And that its criminals are extremely pathological, even more the general public.
[2:30:13.520 --> 2:30:15.520]  They do the same things over and over again.
[2:30:15.520 --> 2:30:20.520]  And criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again.
[2:30:20.520 --> 2:30:29.520]  Well, guess what? It was Anthony Fauci, a eugenicist globalist that ran the rollout of HIV
[2:30:29.520 --> 2:30:34.520]  and the mistreatment of it with AZT and other chemicals that actually killed more people than HIV.
[2:30:34.520 --> 2:30:39.520]  And they were the ones involved in viral research of viruses that would actually go attack the t-lint
[2:30:39.520 --> 2:30:42.520]  besides the body and create autoimmune disorders.
[2:30:42.520 --> 2:30:49.520]  The problem for them was the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down the road.
[2:30:49.520 --> 2:30:52.520]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine,
[2:30:52.520 --> 2:30:55.520]  because now they admit the COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system,
[2:30:55.520 --> 2:30:58.520]  basically giving you the equivalent of HIV.
[2:30:58.520 --> 2:31:27.520]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:31:29.520 --> 2:31:32.520]  Not because you've done something wrong, but because the big telecoms, big tech,
[2:31:32.520 --> 2:31:35.520]  and the globalists are predatory and are evil.
[2:31:35.520 --> 2:31:41.520]  And in the surveillance state, we need to more and more start doing everything we can to mitigate the criminal activity they're involved in.

[2:34:31.520 --> 2:34:37.520]  but on the bodies and the Turboforce, that sales got it in Saturday.
[2:34:37.520 --> 2:34:42.520]  So, InfoWareStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[2:34:42.520 --> 2:34:51.520]  Separately, go to InfoWareStore.com and you can get a very high quality satellite phone that works anywhere you can see the sky,
[2:34:51.520 --> 2:34:57.520]  plus they have antennas for your car or for indoors for it, that anywhere you can see the sky you can communicate with.
[2:34:57.520 --> 2:35:06.520]  People can call you for free on it, the phone is free, but you pay $100 or $99 a month for the 150 minutes
[2:35:06.520 --> 2:35:08.520]  and if you don't use them, they roll over.
[2:35:08.520 --> 2:35:12.520]  So, calling people cost, getting calls doesn't, these phones cannot be tracked.
[2:35:12.520 --> 2:35:23.520]  That is InfoWareStore.com, InfoWareStore.com or 941-955-1020, 941-955-1020, InfoWareStore.com.
[2:35:23.520 --> 2:35:31.520]  And then also, I'm supporting Mike Lindell and Free Speech and I'm supporting investigations into elections.
[2:35:31.520 --> 2:35:35.520]  That's the birthright of Americans, the Democrats, so they don't trust these companies.
[2:35:35.520 --> 2:35:42.520]  My main focus has been the ballot stuffing and the lack of signatures and Barnes has been that as well,
[2:35:42.520 --> 2:35:44.520]  and he was one of the lawyers working for Trump on that.
[2:35:44.520 --> 2:35:47.520]  We'll talk to him about a moment, but I am supporting this symposium.
[2:35:47.520 --> 2:35:53.520]  And if you go to frankspeech.com or mypilla.com, it's the same deals on there.
[2:35:53.520 --> 2:35:54.520]  We have the best deals.
[2:35:54.520 --> 2:35:56.520]  They've got promo code Alex across the board.
[2:35:56.520 --> 2:36:02.520]  You get up to 66% off with promo code Alex at frankspeech.com or mypilla.com.
[2:36:02.520 --> 2:36:05.520]  Great human beds, dog beds, cat beds, pillows, of course.
[2:36:05.520 --> 2:36:07.520]  They've got all the different sheets.
[2:36:07.520 --> 2:36:09.520]  They've got slippers and shoes.
[2:36:09.520 --> 2:36:11.520]  I mean, just a great American company.
[2:36:11.520 --> 2:36:15.520]  66% off mypilla.com with promo code Alex.
[2:36:15.520 --> 2:36:17.520]  All right, getting back to Barnes.
[2:36:17.520 --> 2:36:24.520]  Any other points on the big rollout, the globalist program to change the subject of Brexit
[2:36:24.520 --> 2:36:28.520]  and change the subject of Trump and Bolsonaro and all of it and get the yellow vest off the street.
[2:36:28.520 --> 2:36:30.520]  It's been very successful up front.
[2:36:30.520 --> 2:36:34.520]  But when I look at evil and blitzkriegs throughout history,
[2:36:34.520 --> 2:36:38.520]  they always seem to win up front, but then they slow down, then it reverses.
[2:36:38.520 --> 2:36:42.520]  What are the weak spots in this and give us your real prognostication?
[2:36:42.520 --> 2:36:46.520]  Your real, I guess it would be more of a medical term.
[2:36:46.520 --> 2:36:50.520]  You're there at the sick bed of the world or America.
[2:36:50.520 --> 2:36:53.520]  What is your prognosis on where we really are?
[2:36:53.520 --> 2:36:54.520]  Give it to a straight Barnes.
[2:36:54.520 --> 2:36:56.520]  I respect you.
[2:36:56.520 --> 2:36:59.520]  So legally, we are in the right and they are in the wrong.
[2:36:59.520 --> 2:37:03.520]  Legally, the Americans with Disabilities Act is supposed to prohibit medical examinations,
[2:37:03.520 --> 2:37:07.520]  including medical exam, asking questions about perceived disabilities,
[2:37:07.520 --> 2:37:10.520]  which in my view includes vaccination status.
[2:37:10.520 --> 2:37:14.520]  The HIPAA laws restrict what information an employer can share with other parties.
[2:37:14.520 --> 2:37:19.520]  The common law right of battery means that you're not supposed to be a,
[2:37:19.520 --> 2:37:24.520]  no one's supposed to be allowed to invade your body without your informed consent.
[2:37:24.520 --> 2:37:30.520]  The Nuremberg Code, the Constitution are supposed to prohibit the ability of governments or anybody
[2:37:30.520 --> 2:37:34.520]  to do medical experimentation on you, which is what this is.
[2:37:34.520 --> 2:37:38.520]  The FDA has not followed the informed consent or citizen petition protocols
[2:37:38.520 --> 2:37:42.520]  for either the emergency use authorization or full authorization.
[2:37:42.520 --> 2:37:45.520]  And so on that basis, we're right on the law.
[2:37:45.520 --> 2:37:50.520]  The key hurdle is that those with power don't care about that law
[2:37:50.520 --> 2:37:52.520]  and are trying to avoid enforcing that law.
[2:37:52.520 --> 2:37:54.520]  So that's our only hurdle.
[2:37:54.520 --> 2:37:57.520]  And that's what can counteract that is the court of public opinion
[2:37:57.520 --> 2:38:01.520]  and taking as many cases and putting it right to the courts as possible.
[2:38:01.520 --> 2:38:02.520]  And that's what we're going to be doing.
[2:38:02.520 --> 2:38:05.520]  And for people who want to see an example of a letter,
[2:38:05.520 --> 2:38:09.520]  there are, many people don't know, you have in many places,
[2:38:09.520 --> 2:38:13.520]  your employer or whoever's requiring it has a religious exception.
[2:38:13.520 --> 2:38:17.520]  And what many people don't know is almost to my knowledge,
[2:38:17.520 --> 2:38:22.520]  every one of the vaccines currently being authorized, utilized at some level,
[2:38:22.520 --> 2:38:27.520]  aborted fetuses, tissue from aborted fetuses in the process of developing it.
[2:38:27.520 --> 2:38:31.520]  That is a right of religious objection to the vaccine.
[2:38:31.520 --> 2:38:36.520]  That information plus an example of a letter that was sent that has been successful
[2:38:36.520 --> 2:38:38.520]  for at least some people is available.
[2:38:38.520 --> 2:38:40.520]  You can copy and paste it.
[2:38:40.520 --> 2:38:45.520]  No copyright asserted at viva barnslaw.locals.com.
[2:38:45.520 --> 2:38:47.520]  It's both pinned at the top of the board.
[2:38:47.520 --> 2:38:49.520]  Say it again and we're going to show it for TV viewers and radio listeners.
[2:38:49.520 --> 2:38:51.520]  Must get it and must share it.
[2:38:51.520 --> 2:38:52.520]  Say it again.
[2:38:52.520 --> 2:38:56.520]  Viva barnslaw.locals.com.
[2:38:56.520 --> 2:38:58.520]  And let me spend on this.
[2:38:58.520 --> 2:39:01.520]  They always leave the religious exemption and conscientious exemption
[2:39:01.520 --> 2:39:04.520]  and as well around the world because the globalists aren't taking these shots.
[2:39:04.520 --> 2:39:05.520]  That always comes out.
[2:39:05.520 --> 2:39:07.520]  So they leave themselves little escape doors.
[2:39:07.520 --> 2:39:10.520]  I have nurses calling to go, they're going to fire me next week.
[2:39:10.520 --> 2:39:11.520]  I don't take it.
[2:39:11.520 --> 2:39:12.520]  I go, is there a religious exemption?
[2:39:12.520 --> 2:39:15.520]  And they go, let me check and they call back a week later going, oh my God,
[2:39:15.520 --> 2:39:16.520]  I signed the exemption.
[2:39:16.520 --> 2:39:17.520]  It's fine.
[2:39:17.520 --> 2:39:19.520]  So again, the globalists leave themselves back doors.
[2:39:19.520 --> 2:39:22.520]  That's why my people perish for lack of knowledge.
[2:39:22.520 --> 2:39:23.520]  Exactly.
[2:39:23.520 --> 2:39:28.520]  And what many people did not know because the media has suppressed this is the reason
[2:39:28.520 --> 2:39:33.520]  why you have a sincere religious objection is because of how they develop this vaccine.
[2:39:33.520 --> 2:39:35.520]  They use tissue from aborted fetuses.
[2:39:35.520 --> 2:39:36.520]  And they clone it.
[2:39:36.520 --> 2:39:38.520]  And I mean, let's be clear.
[2:39:38.520 --> 2:39:39.520]  Okay.
[2:39:39.520 --> 2:39:41.520]  I'm heterosexual and I like my wife.
[2:39:41.520 --> 2:39:43.520]  But I mean, I'm a man.
[2:39:43.520 --> 2:39:44.520]  She's a woman.
[2:39:44.520 --> 2:39:49.520]  I mean, just the idea of somebody else's blood products in me,
[2:39:49.520 --> 2:39:51.520]  much less the whole genome of a dead baby.
[2:39:51.520 --> 2:39:52.520]  That's just not healthy.
[2:39:52.520 --> 2:39:54.520]  I mean, that's just scary.
[2:39:54.520 --> 2:40:00.520]  I mean, I have a right to not have some clone baby or some immortal cell line
[2:40:00.520 --> 2:40:06.520]  from some poor lady that died in 1951 put in me or the genome of a jellyfish
[2:40:06.520 --> 2:40:07.520]  that's in the Pfizer shot.
[2:40:07.520 --> 2:40:09.520]  And then we ask, why is it in there?
[2:40:09.520 --> 2:40:10.520]  They won't tell us.
[2:40:10.520 --> 2:40:11.520]  Remember?
[2:40:11.520 --> 2:40:12.520]  Precisely.
[2:40:12.520 --> 2:40:16.520]  And that's why in many states, this is a required.
[2:40:16.520 --> 2:40:18.520]  They have to include this.
[2:40:18.520 --> 2:40:21.520]  People should also look up some states have philosophical objections.
[2:40:21.520 --> 2:40:26.520]  The state of Oregon has prohibited vaccines from being mandated for as a condition of
[2:40:26.520 --> 2:40:27.520]  employment for a long time.
[2:40:27.520 --> 2:40:32.520]  So there's a lot of laws that protect you that the media is not letting you know about.
[2:40:32.520 --> 2:40:33.520]  Exactly.
[2:40:33.520 --> 2:40:34.520]  And I was about to tell a story.
[2:40:34.520 --> 2:40:35.520]  I'll just go.
[2:40:35.520 --> 2:40:36.520]  Everybody knows about women, your wives or whatever.
[2:40:36.520 --> 2:40:40.520]  If they're not wanting to get pregnant and you and you, you, you're having sex with your
[2:40:40.520 --> 2:40:42.520]  wife and you, you know, ejaculate inside of them, they get pissed off.
[2:40:42.520 --> 2:40:44.520]  They go, Hey, I don't know if I want a baby right now.
[2:40:44.520 --> 2:40:48.520]  Imagine your wife gives you permission to, you know, do that inside of her.
[2:40:48.520 --> 2:40:53.520]  But now they want to put this genetic engineered crap with a dead baby's genome in you.
[2:40:53.520 --> 2:40:54.520]  Bill Gates does.
[2:40:54.520 --> 2:40:56.520]  Come on, women, especially women.
[2:40:56.520 --> 2:40:59.520]  Don't women get this is rape, Bob?
[2:40:59.520 --> 2:41:01.520]  Well, and that's how many people compare it to.
[2:41:01.520 --> 2:41:05.520]  I mean, again, if the government owns your body, if your employer effectively owns your
[2:41:05.520 --> 2:41:10.520]  body, controls what goes into your body, including these foreign substances, mental
[2:41:10.520 --> 2:41:13.520]  substances, then, then do you, what do we own?
[2:41:13.520 --> 2:41:17.520]  We have, we have no liberty if we don't have autonomy of our own body.
[2:41:17.520 --> 2:41:19.520]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[2:41:19.520 --> 2:41:22.520]  Women ask yourself that if you don't want to get pregnant and your husband does that,
[2:41:22.520 --> 2:41:26.520]  you're like, Hey, Bob, or you know, Hey, David, or Hey, whatever your guy's name is,
[2:41:26.520 --> 2:41:28.520]  like, Hey, what are you trying to do?
[2:41:28.520 --> 2:41:30.520]  I told you, I don't want to get pregnant right now.
[2:41:30.520 --> 2:41:34.520]  Imagine that women versus Bill Gates wanting to put this in your body.
[2:41:34.520 --> 2:41:39.520]  And not only that, as you mentioned, the path here is to require this all the time.
[2:41:39.520 --> 2:41:41.520]  This is not going to be a one-off.
[2:41:41.520 --> 2:41:42.520]  First, it was one shot.
[2:41:42.520 --> 2:41:43.520]  Then it was two shots.
[2:41:43.520 --> 2:41:44.520]  Then it was three shots.
[2:41:44.520 --> 2:41:48.520]  Now it's going to be boosters every couple of months for the rest of your life.
[2:41:48.520 --> 2:41:52.520]  And once they condition you to accept this, and how are they going to know what the real
[2:41:52.520 --> 2:41:54.520]  vaccine identification is?
[2:41:54.520 --> 2:41:58.520]  They're ultimately going to say that there's holes in the electronic verification and
[2:41:58.520 --> 2:42:00.520]  the documentary verification.
[2:42:00.520 --> 2:42:03.520]  So what is it going to come back to when we were talking about a year ago?
[2:42:03.520 --> 2:42:06.520]  Just track Bill Gates patents like you were doing at the very beginning.
[2:42:06.520 --> 2:42:07.520]  What are you going to find?
[2:42:07.520 --> 2:42:11.520]  You're going to find things like quantum tattoos that can track who is vaccinated
[2:42:11.520 --> 2:42:12.520]  and who is not.
[2:42:12.520 --> 2:42:16.520]  And then they're going to use that as your identity card, tie it into your finances
[2:42:16.520 --> 2:42:20.520]  and your currency so that not only can you not go into a store or restaurant or work
[2:42:20.520 --> 2:42:24.520]  for somebody, you won't even be able to purchase anything unless you've complied with
[2:42:24.520 --> 2:42:25.520]  whatever the latest government is.
[2:42:25.520 --> 2:42:29.520]  I mean, this is like a nightmare science fiction black mirror thing come true.
[2:42:29.520 --> 2:42:33.520]  And the crazy part is Bill Gates sits there with his wife and goes, we've never had a
[2:42:33.520 --> 2:42:34.520]  plan for chips.
[2:42:34.520 --> 2:42:36.520]  He's funding dozens of plans.
[2:42:36.520 --> 2:42:41.520]  And Klaus Schwab is on TV saying, I should have a medical ID.
[2:42:41.520 --> 2:42:42.520]  Then it will be in your clothing.
[2:42:42.520 --> 2:42:43.520]  And then we will put a chip in you.
[2:42:43.520 --> 2:42:45.520]  I mean, they're out in the open.
[2:42:45.520 --> 2:42:47.520]  It's don't have to believe us anymore.
[2:42:47.520 --> 2:42:50.520]  We'll come back and talk about election fraud and where that's going with Trump and
[2:42:50.520 --> 2:42:51.520]  Robert Barnes.
[2:42:51.520 --> 2:42:54.520]  We won't really feel you're about to get it, not BS, not Q-Craft.
[2:42:54.520 --> 2:43:01.520]  Stay with us.
[2:43:24.520 --> 2:43:27.520]  Without info wars, we'd be in a lot more trouble than we are right now.

[2:44:27.520 --> 2:44:33.520]  This is the Rockefeller Foundation.
[2:44:33.520 --> 2:44:35.520]  They developed this whole plan with Bill Gates.
[2:44:35.520 --> 2:44:39.520]  They're now implementing it and now they've announced that the US policy is set by the
[2:44:39.520 --> 2:44:40.520]  private Rockefeller Foundation.
[2:44:40.520 --> 2:44:45.520]  Of course, the Rockefeller Foundation by the 30s was the main funder of Adolf, Alois
[2:44:45.520 --> 2:44:49.520]  Hitler, and the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor that trained the Coserville home institute
[2:44:49.520 --> 2:44:50.520]  in Germany.
[2:44:50.520 --> 2:44:52.520]  Info wars will continue to set fast.
[2:44:52.520 --> 2:44:54.520]  They fight this, I don't know how long we can.
[2:44:54.520 --> 2:44:56.520]  The enemy's coming for us all now.
[2:44:56.520 --> 2:44:57.520]  God bless and good luck.
[2:44:57.520 --> 2:45:26.520]  I would begin your ride with God right now.
[2:45:27.520 --> 2:45:31.520]  So please pray for us and please buy the products at infowarstore.com.
[2:45:31.520 --> 2:45:33.520]  They're great products plus they fund the operation.
[2:45:33.520 --> 2:45:36.520]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[2:45:36.520 --> 2:45:37.520]  Do they fund freedom?
[2:45:37.520 --> 2:45:38.520]  No, a lot of them don't.
[2:45:38.520 --> 2:45:43.520]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking
[2:45:43.520 --> 2:45:45.520]  up and looking for truth.
[2:45:45.520 --> 2:45:47.520]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[2:45:47.520 --> 2:45:50.520]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[2:45:50.520 --> 2:45:53.520]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[2:45:53.520 --> 2:45:57.520]  Download everything we've done, you can find and save it because who knows how long we're
[2:45:57.520 --> 2:46:01.520]  going to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[2:46:01.520 --> 2:46:07.520]  It is through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told.
[2:46:07.520 --> 2:46:13.520]  And the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses, which is why fluoridated
[2:46:13.520 --> 2:46:15.520]  water is a big problem.
[2:46:15.520 --> 2:46:20.520]  Consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland and shuts
[2:46:20.520 --> 2:46:22.520]  down its natural functions.
[2:46:22.520 --> 2:46:25.520]  Natural functions which have been known for millennia.
[2:46:25.520 --> 2:46:28.520]  The Hindu chakras align with the endocrine system.
[2:46:28.520 --> 2:46:31.520]  The chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye.
[2:46:31.520 --> 2:46:36.520]  Also described as the seat of the soul, the pineal gland is what connects us to higher
[2:46:36.520 --> 2:46:41.520]  levels of consciousness and otherwise unseen dimensions of reality.
[2:46:41.520 --> 2:46:46.520]  Fluoride free water is essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy.
[2:46:46.520 --> 2:46:51.520]  Our water filtration systems with the proper filters will keep your drinking water fluoride
[2:46:51.520 --> 2:46:55.520]  free and the propure shower head will seal the deal.
[2:46:55.520 --> 2:47:00.520]  Get them both today for yourself or a friend at infowarstore.com.
[2:47:03.520 --> 2:47:06.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:06.520 --> 2:47:13.520]  Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer, one of the smartest historians I know, joins us live.
[2:47:13.520 --> 2:47:15.520]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[2:47:15.520 --> 2:47:18.520]  And we've got some very special reports that I've taped.
[2:47:18.520 --> 2:47:19.520]  I'll just leave it at that.
[2:47:19.520 --> 2:47:21.520]  They're going to be going live at Band-Aut Video today.
[2:47:21.520 --> 2:47:25.520]  And tomorrow I'm a busy little tiger.
[2:47:25.520 --> 2:47:27.520]  I don't want to finish you off.
[2:47:27.520 --> 2:47:29.520]  I'm going to finish you off.
[2:47:29.520 --> 2:47:31.520]  I'm going to finish you off.
[2:47:31.520 --> 2:47:36.520]  Laura, I'm a busy little tiger.
[2:47:36.520 --> 2:47:40.520]  I don't want to finish up before we get into election fraud and where Trump really is
[2:47:40.520 --> 2:47:43.520]  and all this talk of reinstatement and where that's going in the midterms.
[2:47:43.520 --> 2:47:45.520]  With Barnes with us five minutes to the next hour,
[2:47:45.520 --> 2:47:49.520]  I'm going to finish some news and hand them a gun to Jay Dyer.
[2:47:49.520 --> 2:47:55.520]  But looking at this power grab, it's for all the marbles, a world ID to be able to put things in our body,
[2:47:55.520 --> 2:47:59.520]  to be able to censor and control because they're the saviors.
[2:47:59.520 --> 2:48:01.520]  He is the big push.
[2:48:01.520 --> 2:48:04.520]  And when we talk about Hitler, everybody over talks about Hitler.
[2:48:04.520 --> 2:48:07.520]  But Hitler was actually an idiot.
[2:48:07.520 --> 2:48:12.520]  He was charismatic, had a cult around him, but he was set up.
[2:48:12.520 --> 2:48:17.520]  We know that the Rockefeller Foundation and elements of British intelligence
[2:48:17.520 --> 2:48:18.520]  put Hitler in power.
[2:48:18.520 --> 2:48:20.520]  This is in mainline history books.
[2:48:20.520 --> 2:48:23.520]  They told him he was going to be with Edward VIII, the King of England.
[2:48:23.520 --> 2:48:26.520]  They were going to create a European Union that he would be the king of.
[2:48:26.520 --> 2:48:30.520]  And then England was going to join Germany in attacking the Soviet Union.
[2:48:30.520 --> 2:48:33.520]  Well, then once the war started, England did not do that.
[2:48:33.520 --> 2:48:34.520]  Okay.
[2:48:34.520 --> 2:48:38.520]  And so that's in the secret treaty and Rudolph Hess and all.
[2:48:38.520 --> 2:48:39.520]  This is in the history, folks.
[2:48:39.520 --> 2:48:41.520]  You still see it on the Discovery Channel.
[2:48:41.520 --> 2:48:43.520]  Sometimes they have little pieces of it.
[2:48:43.520 --> 2:48:47.520]  And so the Rockefeller Foundation at a Cold Springs Harbor set up Hitler,
[2:48:47.520 --> 2:48:51.520]  set up the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, and that was their project.
[2:48:51.520 --> 2:48:54.520]  And the globalists kind of thought he might win.
[2:48:54.520 --> 2:48:59.520]  But then when the Germans didn't win, they pulled the rug off from under
[2:48:59.520 --> 2:49:02.520]  and we see the modern world that's come after that.
[2:49:02.520 --> 2:49:05.520]  So I don't want to say we were working with the Nazis or were the Nazis.
[2:49:05.520 --> 2:49:07.520]  Our elites were playing both sides.
[2:49:07.520 --> 2:49:11.520]  And just like we beat the Nazi project or the Communist project,
[2:49:11.520 --> 2:49:13.520]  we're going to beat this project.
[2:49:13.520 --> 2:49:18.520]  But notice the same people set up Xi Jinping and his predecessors like Mao Zedong.
[2:49:18.520 --> 2:49:22.520]  And that's really historic fact, but this is the new permutation.
[2:49:22.520 --> 2:49:25.520]  We're not facing what our ancestors faced 75 years ago.
[2:49:25.520 --> 2:49:27.520]  This is the new assault.
[2:49:27.520 --> 2:49:30.520]  Barnes, your take on that.
[2:49:30.520 --> 2:49:33.520]  Well, they want to return to ultimate state control,
[2:49:33.520 --> 2:49:39.520]  which they were experimenting with at the beginning of the 1900s from 1905 to 1945
[2:49:39.520 --> 2:49:41.520]  in American court case law.
[2:49:41.520 --> 2:49:46.520]  And then, of course, it ultimately culminated and expressed itself in two forms.
[2:49:46.520 --> 2:49:50.520]  The Communist experiment, which was a complete disaster in tobacco for about
[2:49:50.520 --> 2:49:52.520]  a million dead souls afterwards.
[2:49:52.520 --> 2:49:57.520]  And the fascistic example, which was the prime exemplar was, of course,
[2:49:57.520 --> 2:49:59.520]  Hitler and Nazi Germany.
[2:49:59.520 --> 2:50:00.520]  And it's not a coincidence.
[2:50:00.520 --> 2:50:03.520]  Like one of the mistakes that I think has been made so far.
[2:50:03.520 --> 2:50:07.520]  You point out that these supreme court cases were cited at the Nuremberg trial
[2:50:07.520 --> 2:50:10.520]  as the code of the Nazis, which it really was.
[2:50:10.520 --> 2:50:11.520]  That's what I'm saying.
[2:50:11.520 --> 2:50:12.520]  Absolutely.
[2:50:12.520 --> 2:50:16.520]  Whenever Hitler was asked to justify his eugenics agenda,
[2:50:16.520 --> 2:50:18.520]  there was one citation above all.
[2:50:18.520 --> 2:50:22.520]  It was the Supreme Court of the United States of America and Buck V. Bell.
[2:50:22.520 --> 2:50:23.520]  You read that decision.
[2:50:23.520 --> 2:50:25.520]  It's a morally horrendous decision.
[2:50:25.520 --> 2:50:29.520]  You can see documentaries that have been made about some of the victims of it,
[2:50:29.520 --> 2:50:31.520]  just that are just heart wrenching about what they...
[2:50:31.520 --> 2:50:34.520]  So it's not fair to say Hitler was made in the USA,
[2:50:34.520 --> 2:50:39.520]  but the elites of the USA and Britain made Hitler.
[2:50:39.520 --> 2:50:40.520]  No doubt.
[2:50:40.520 --> 2:50:44.520]  Eugenics originated politically and legally in the United States.
[2:50:44.520 --> 2:50:45.520]  That's where the ideas came from.
[2:50:45.520 --> 2:50:47.520]  That's where the ideas germinated from.
[2:50:47.520 --> 2:50:49.520]  And that's who the Nazis looked to.
[2:50:49.520 --> 2:50:53.520]  I mean, they created their eugenics laws based on U.S. eugenics laws.
[2:50:53.520 --> 2:50:56.520]  And that's why Hitler thought the U.S. would sit it out,
[2:50:56.520 --> 2:50:59.520]  or the Brits would, because they freaking put him in power.
[2:50:59.520 --> 2:51:00.520]  Correct.
[2:51:00.520 --> 2:51:02.520]  I mean, they just made fundamental assumptions.
[2:51:02.520 --> 2:51:06.520]  People should ask why there was such reluctance to get involved in the war
[2:51:06.520 --> 2:51:10.520]  against Germany and the United States and in the U.K.
[2:51:10.520 --> 2:51:13.520]  in certain aspects amongst political elites
[2:51:13.520 --> 2:51:17.520]  and the most logical explanation when you dig into it
[2:51:17.520 --> 2:51:20.520]  is a lot of people were sympathetic amongst American elites
[2:51:20.520 --> 2:51:22.520]  with the fascistic experiment.
[2:51:22.520 --> 2:51:24.520]  And that's just the reality of it.
[2:51:24.520 --> 2:51:28.520]  You can find it scattered throughout a large number of terrifying examples
[2:51:28.520 --> 2:51:32.520]  of prominent intellectuals that people don't realize were Nazis...
[2:51:32.520 --> 2:51:38.520]  And now what do you make of the ADL calling anyone that doesn't want this Nazi law over us Nazis?
[2:51:38.520 --> 2:51:42.520]  It's in the, as you know, the two-month-old terrorism policy put out by Biden says,
[2:51:42.520 --> 2:51:46.520]  you question lockdowns, you are a white supremacist, equals terrorism,
[2:51:46.520 --> 2:51:50.520]  equals CIA will be unleashed on you, and the liberals are...
[2:51:50.520 --> 2:51:51.520]  It's madness.
[2:51:51.520 --> 2:51:55.520]  And I look at the head of the ADL up there insanely saying,
[2:51:55.520 --> 2:51:57.520]  I'm not against the Jews or the ADL.
[2:51:57.520 --> 2:51:59.520]  Why are they doing this to us?
[2:51:59.520 --> 2:52:04.520]  Essentially all the organizations that receive big money from anybody important,
[2:52:04.520 --> 2:52:07.520]  either in the pharmaceutical industry or the Bill Gates world.
[2:52:07.520 --> 2:52:10.520]  I mean, Bill Gates has basically bought off the entire public health...
[2:52:10.520 --> 2:52:12.520]  So that's it. Southern Barbie Law Center, ADL.
[2:52:12.520 --> 2:52:15.520]  It doesn't matter if it's a leftist group or right...
[2:52:15.520 --> 2:52:17.520]  They bought it all off.
[2:52:17.520 --> 2:52:18.520]  And no doubt.
[2:52:18.520 --> 2:52:22.520]  And I mean, and some of the worst people are going to be your old federalist society people.
[2:52:22.520 --> 2:52:27.520]  The people that the three judges who just affirmed the Indiana vaccination case,
[2:52:27.520 --> 2:52:33.520]  who compared getting a forced vaccine to being like having to take a test or pay tuition.
[2:52:33.520 --> 2:52:35.520]  An utterly absurd comparison.
[2:52:35.520 --> 2:52:36.520]  But who was it?
[2:52:36.520 --> 2:52:38.520]  It was two of them were Trump appointees.
[2:52:38.520 --> 2:52:41.520]  You warned, you warned, and you warned Trump too.
[2:52:41.520 --> 2:52:42.520]  And you've been vindicated.
[2:52:42.520 --> 2:52:44.520]  This Amy Coney Barrett.
[2:52:44.520 --> 2:52:46.520]  I mean, what a moron.
[2:52:46.520 --> 2:52:47.520]  I mean, no doubt.
[2:52:47.520 --> 2:52:48.520]  Look at Kavanaugh.
[2:52:48.520 --> 2:52:53.520]  Kavanaugh is the only reason why this CDC eviction moratorium could even come back in.
[2:52:53.520 --> 2:52:54.520]  Because he said, oh, don't worry.
[2:52:54.520 --> 2:52:56.520]  It's going to end at the end of July.
[2:52:56.520 --> 2:52:59.520]  So I agree it's unconstitutional, but I'll just, you know,
[2:52:59.520 --> 2:53:01.520]  we can just wait to do anything about it.
[2:53:01.520 --> 2:53:02.520]  And so what do they do?
[2:53:02.520 --> 2:53:05.520]  The Biden administration uses it as a pretext to extend it.
[2:53:05.520 --> 2:53:08.520]  A massive property grab.
[2:53:08.520 --> 2:53:12.520]  Kavanaugh green lights them to have the CDC now be able to do something that no federal
[2:53:12.520 --> 2:53:17.520]  agency can do outside of martial law, say people's rent is suspended.
[2:53:17.520 --> 2:53:18.520]  Absolutely.
[2:53:18.520 --> 2:53:21.520]  I mean, the CDC has effectively become everybody's landlord.
[2:53:21.520 --> 2:53:25.520]  And your big landlords are getting bailed out by the Fed.
[2:53:25.520 --> 2:53:26.520]  It's your small business.
[2:53:26.520 --> 2:53:27.520]  Your small homeowner.
[2:53:27.520 --> 2:53:29.520]  It's all a consolidation of power.
[2:53:29.520 --> 2:53:31.520]  It's all a consolidation of power.
[2:53:31.520 --> 2:53:32.520]  Absolutely.
[2:53:32.520 --> 2:53:36.520]  It's the biggest power grab in history and we have to do everything possible to fight
[2:53:36.520 --> 2:53:37.520]  back against it.
[2:53:37.520 --> 2:53:42.520]  And the mass censorship by big tech is just an extension of it because they know they
[2:53:42.520 --> 2:53:44.520]  need people to be uninformed.
[2:53:44.520 --> 2:53:47.520]  It's where info wars has been critical.
[2:53:47.520 --> 2:53:52.520]  Essential has been this audience has been the tip of the spear on everything related
[2:53:52.520 --> 2:53:53.520]  to these issues.
[2:53:53.520 --> 2:53:57.520]  And sooner or later, I mean, literally it has been tomorrow's news today.
[2:53:57.520 --> 2:54:00.520]  That's what's happened repeatedly over the last year.
[2:54:00.520 --> 2:54:02.520]  Well, you've been the tip of the spear.
[2:54:02.520 --> 2:54:03.520]  It's not about kissing ass here.
[2:54:03.520 --> 2:54:06.520]  I don't know how the hell you know all this Barnes because there's few people who know
[2:54:06.520 --> 2:54:08.520]  as much as I do or more, you know as much or more.
[2:54:08.520 --> 2:54:11.520]  But I mean, to me, what is it like knowing all this?
[2:54:11.520 --> 2:54:13.520]  Because I'm genuinely horrified.
[2:54:13.520 --> 2:54:16.520]  I mean, it's like I physically had a thing where I'm not scared.
[2:54:16.520 --> 2:54:17.520]  God pulls it down on me.
[2:54:17.520 --> 2:54:21.520]  Something that I mean, I can handle my physical self and I can, I can say, well, my kids are
[2:54:21.520 --> 2:54:22.520]  in the game.
[2:54:22.520 --> 2:54:23.520]  That's the way it is.
[2:54:23.520 --> 2:54:24.520]  It's getting the game.
[2:54:24.520 --> 2:54:27.520]  But just at a horror level watching this, it's getting to me.
[2:54:27.520 --> 2:54:30.520]  It's just the evil, the insanity, the upside down.
[2:54:30.520 --> 2:54:32.520]  It's like where we're going.
[2:54:32.520 --> 2:54:36.520]  I have this real sense of like nostalgia and sadness for the country.
[2:54:36.520 --> 2:54:39.520]  I mean, we are in deep crap.
[2:54:39.520 --> 2:54:40.520]  No doubt.
[2:54:40.520 --> 2:54:43.520]  This is a terrifying time of what they're trying to do.
[2:54:43.520 --> 2:54:50.520]  It is the most dangerous totalitarian experiment for any American or Western democracy in the
[2:54:50.520 --> 2:54:52.520]  history of our democracies.
[2:54:52.520 --> 2:54:53.520]  That's what we face.
[2:54:53.520 --> 2:54:56.520]  And that's why we have to fight back by every means possible.
[2:54:56.520 --> 2:54:57.520]  And that's the thing, Robert.
[2:54:57.520 --> 2:54:59.520]  This isn't just like it's tyranny.
[2:54:59.520 --> 2:55:00.520]  It is cartoon level.
[2:55:00.520 --> 2:55:06.520]  I mean, it's just flaming and exploding and often it's like they, it's like they went
[2:55:06.520 --> 2:55:08.520]  down a checklist of every evil thing you can do.
[2:55:08.520 --> 2:55:09.520]  And they just double checked it all.
[2:55:09.520 --> 2:55:10.520]  I want this.
[2:55:10.520 --> 2:55:11.520]  I want that.
[2:55:11.520 --> 2:55:14.520]  It's like a person in a buffet ordering 500 plates of food.
[2:55:14.520 --> 2:55:16.520]  I mean, it's like, why are they doing this?
[2:55:16.520 --> 2:55:18.520]  Just a total pell-mell power grab.
[2:55:18.520 --> 2:55:19.520]  It completely.
[2:55:19.520 --> 2:55:24.520]  In fact, what they want to do is establish the legal medical political precedent that
[2:55:24.520 --> 2:55:26.520]  they can do whatever they want.
[2:55:26.520 --> 2:55:29.520]  And that's why they, I mean, here we have a virus that is the Delta variant, according
[2:55:29.520 --> 2:55:35.520]  to UK data, is less deadly to the average healthy person than the flu to the ordinary person.
[2:55:35.520 --> 2:55:40.520]  So why are they choosing this virus as the one to scare monger into all of this power?
[2:55:40.520 --> 2:55:45.520]  Because if they can do it for this virus, they can do it for anything, anytime, anywhere.
[2:55:45.520 --> 2:55:47.520]  Same with the emergency use authorization.
[2:55:47.520 --> 2:55:53.520]  Why do emergency use authorization continually for this virus and this novel experimental
[2:55:53.520 --> 2:55:54.520]  vaccine?
[2:55:54.520 --> 2:55:57.520]  Because if they can do it for this, then they can do it anytime, anywhere.
[2:55:57.520 --> 2:55:58.520]  And it's very simple.
[2:55:58.520 --> 2:56:01.520]  You have a corrupt ruling class with Epstein and all of it coming out.
[2:56:01.520 --> 2:56:02.520]  They're all being blackmailed.
[2:56:02.520 --> 2:56:03.520]  They're scared.
[2:56:03.520 --> 2:56:04.520]  The Ponzi scheme's coming to an end.
[2:56:04.520 --> 2:56:08.520]  So this is just their defense mechanism to clear us all criminals, to clear us all
[2:56:08.520 --> 2:56:13.020]  bio threats, to clear us all evil, and just hope that we're so busy trying to get food
[2:56:13.020 --> 2:56:17.520]  on the table on our road to third world them that they never get in trouble.
[2:56:17.520 --> 2:56:18.520]  Exactly.
[2:56:18.520 --> 2:56:23.520]  I mean, basically, this is the Epstein agenda, what his real agenda was, when you look at
[2:56:23.520 --> 2:56:28.520]  who he's associated with, what his objectives were, this is the Epstein agenda, come to
[2:56:28.520 --> 2:56:29.520]  life.
[2:56:29.520 --> 2:56:30.520]  That's what this is.
[2:56:30.520 --> 2:56:31.520]  And that's what they want to do.
[2:56:31.520 --> 2:56:35.760]  They want to legally treat us no different than chattel.
[2:56:35.760 --> 2:56:36.760]  That's their goal.
[2:56:36.760 --> 2:56:37.760]  That's their objective.
[2:56:37.760 --> 2:56:39.080]  It has been for a long time.
[2:56:39.080 --> 2:56:41.520]  And that's why we have to show the world we're not chattel.
[2:56:41.520 --> 2:56:46.680]  Barnes, if you were writing a novel about a nightmare dystopia, if we read this 10 years
[2:56:46.680 --> 2:56:48.680]  ago, we would believe it.
[2:56:48.680 --> 2:56:53.080]  I mean, this is, in one word, how do you describe this, because it's beyond tyranny.
[2:56:53.080 --> 2:56:54.080]  What do you call this?
[2:56:54.080 --> 2:56:55.080]  Just diabolical?
[2:56:55.080 --> 2:56:57.160]  Well, it's new world fascism.
[2:56:57.160 --> 2:56:58.160]  That's what it is.
[2:56:58.160 --> 2:57:03.040]  It's just the Nazi corpse come back to life.
[2:57:03.040 --> 2:57:05.400]  And the left all says everyone's a Nazi.
[2:57:05.400 --> 2:57:09.800]  That's for free speech when they're literally led by a Nazi collaborator.
[2:57:09.800 --> 2:57:10.800]  Absolutely.
[2:57:10.800 --> 2:57:14.600]  I mean, and all the stakeholders have been corrupted.
[2:57:14.600 --> 2:57:20.080]  It shows the constant continuous effect of big media, big tech, big government collusion
[2:57:20.080 --> 2:57:22.040]  over the last decade plus.
[2:57:22.040 --> 2:57:27.240]  They all now are colluding and frankly conspiring against the public health and constitutional
[2:57:27.240 --> 2:57:30.480]  democracy and every core liberty we've ever valued.
[2:57:30.480 --> 2:57:34.920]  And it's going to be up to us to fight back because we are literally the last line of
[2:57:34.920 --> 2:57:35.920]  defense.
[2:57:35.920 --> 2:57:36.920]  Absolutely.
[2:57:36.920 --> 2:57:38.000]  If America falls, the whole world does.
[2:57:38.000 --> 2:57:39.600]  We are being assaulted visually.
[2:57:39.600 --> 2:57:43.880]  Let's do five more minutes on the election fraud, whether what's going on.
[2:57:43.880 --> 2:57:44.880]  Trump reinstatement, all that stuff.
[2:57:44.880 --> 2:57:50.240]  And I've got some other news I'm going to hit then J. Dyer.
[2:57:50.240 --> 2:57:54.960]  It was our number two best selling product until the ongoing COVID lockdowns destroyed
[2:57:54.960 --> 2:57:55.960]  the supply chain.
[2:57:55.960 --> 2:57:59.560]  And it's been six months since we had bodies, our ultimate turmeric formula.
[2:57:59.560 --> 2:58:02.760]  And what's been holding up the last few months is the bottle cap.
[2:58:02.760 --> 2:58:03.760]  That's why this one's white.
[2:58:03.760 --> 2:58:05.960]  I said, I don't care if the cap doesn't match.
[2:58:05.960 --> 2:58:10.520]  Get it packaged, get it to us, get it shipped out because it's amazing for information.
[2:58:10.520 --> 2:58:12.400]  It's amazing for your immune system.

[2:58:53.520 --> 2:58:54.520]  You're on the air.
[2:58:54.520 --> 2:58:55.520]  Trying to move quicker.
[2:58:55.520 --> 2:58:56.520]  Hey, Alex.
[2:58:56.520 --> 2:58:57.520]  Welcome.
[2:58:57.520 --> 2:59:00.120]  Would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this
[2:59:00.120 --> 2:59:01.120]  stupidity.
[2:59:01.120 --> 2:59:04.120]  Wanted to warn people I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year.
[2:59:04.120 --> 2:59:05.120]  Okay.
[2:59:05.120 --> 2:59:10.040]  I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go
[2:59:10.040 --> 2:59:11.040]  away.
[2:59:11.040 --> 2:59:12.560]  A living defense saved my life.
[2:59:12.560 --> 2:59:16.880]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[2:59:16.880 --> 2:59:18.320]  Living defense brought me back.
[2:59:18.320 --> 2:59:24.040]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[2:59:24.040 --> 2:59:30.800]  This is Matthew 24, verse nine, then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall
[2:59:30.800 --> 2:59:36.960]  kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake and then shall many be
[2:59:36.960 --> 2:59:41.000]  offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[2:59:41.000 --> 2:59:42.880]  That's right where we're at brother.
[2:59:42.880 --> 2:59:47.320]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country, no matter what they say.
[2:59:47.320 --> 2:59:54.320]  And that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country.
[2:59:54.320 --> 3:00:05.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:05.600 --> 3:00:14.920]  The beast in me is caged by frail and fragile bars.
[3:00:14.920 --> 3:00:16.440]  Boy, ain't that the truth.
[3:00:16.440 --> 3:00:19.360]  At least my beast is caged.
[3:00:19.360 --> 3:00:27.360]  Restless by day and by night, rants and rages at the stars.
[3:00:27.360 --> 3:00:30.360]  All right, Barnes, we can do a whole hour on this.
[3:00:30.360 --> 3:00:32.360]  Maybe you'll join us again next week.
[3:00:32.360 --> 3:00:35.880]  I don't want to give people BS.
[3:00:35.880 --> 3:00:38.480]  So what's what's really going on with the fraudulent election?
[3:00:38.480 --> 3:00:39.480]  What's the most important stuff?
[3:00:39.480 --> 3:00:44.400]  It's real versus what's pipe dream just in a five minute summation.
[3:00:44.400 --> 3:00:49.480]  So what's real is Wisconsin appointing a special counsel to investigate the election and ever
[3:00:49.480 --> 3:00:54.120]  all the irregularities that took place in 2020 in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania State Senate
[3:00:54.120 --> 3:00:58.160]  looking at replicating what the Georgia State of the Arizona State Senate did in auditing
[3:00:58.160 --> 3:01:02.880]  their election, the Georgia litigation exposing all kinds of problems in Fulton County and
[3:01:02.880 --> 3:01:06.840]  other locations in Georgia and what happened in November of 2020.
[3:01:06.840 --> 3:01:12.040]  The Arizona audit moving forward, including the Senate's attempt to particularly get information
[3:01:12.040 --> 3:01:16.520]  not only from Dominion, but from the Maricopa County, including the mail envelopes.
[3:01:16.520 --> 3:01:20.760]  And the reason why that's important is they want to match signatures and see if the signature
[3:01:20.760 --> 3:01:22.280]  match that never happened.
[3:01:22.280 --> 3:01:24.280]  Nobody did a meaningful signature match.
[3:01:24.280 --> 3:01:26.880]  And you've been pushing for that since the election.
[3:01:26.880 --> 3:01:27.880]  Exactly.
[3:01:27.880 --> 3:01:31.400]  It's why I told the president very first time I talked, I said, if the election is on the
[3:01:31.400 --> 3:01:37.240]  up and up, they'll do an independently confirmed independently observed signature match.
[3:01:37.240 --> 3:01:42.280]  No state ever would no state ever did in order for Arizona to do that part.
[3:01:42.280 --> 3:01:43.280]  They need Maricopa.
[3:01:43.280 --> 3:01:48.480]  Instead, it's always frackens and 90 year old generals are not being mean and secret
[3:01:48.480 --> 3:01:49.480]  files.
[3:01:49.480 --> 3:01:52.240]  And it's just total red errands completely.
[3:01:52.240 --> 3:01:57.240]  And I mean, for every great crime, you need a great Patsy Dominion and everything related
[3:01:57.240 --> 3:02:01.960]  to that in Germany and all that was a great Patsy, in my view, to distract people from
[3:02:01.960 --> 3:02:05.400]  how they really stole the election, which was the old fashioned way.
[3:02:05.400 --> 3:02:08.240]  They stuffed a bunch of ballots that shouldn't have counted into the ballot box.
[3:02:08.240 --> 3:02:13.120]  And they said, they said, Red Mirage, it'll look like Trump wins, but we'll have the balance.
[3:02:13.120 --> 3:02:14.880]  I mean, they, they, they did it in front of us.
[3:02:14.880 --> 3:02:16.800]  People don't cover up for Dominion Jones.
[3:02:16.800 --> 3:02:19.040]  Hell, I'm not, I don't like Dominion.
[3:02:19.040 --> 3:02:23.320]  My point is you can't prove the CEO of Dominion did stuff electronically, but you can prove
[3:02:23.320 --> 3:02:28.600]  they had suitcases under the tables in Atlanta and were triple counting them.
[3:02:28.600 --> 3:02:29.600]  Exactly.
[3:02:29.600 --> 3:02:35.600]  People should ask, why did Biden's team put out what a margin they needed to win on election
[3:02:35.600 --> 3:02:36.600]  day?
[3:02:36.600 --> 3:02:40.480]  And when they did not hit that margin, why did they put that number out?
[3:02:40.480 --> 3:02:45.040]  Because they wanted their key people to know, oh, we need to add this many more ballots.
[3:02:45.040 --> 3:02:50.800]  As you see the email out of the election official in, in Michigan in Detroit, she goes, oh,
[3:02:50.800 --> 3:02:56.000]  thank God you got the exact number I needed, how magic that's exactly what happened.
[3:02:56.000 --> 3:02:57.000]  So what's happening?
[3:02:57.000 --> 3:02:58.000]  So it's still what's good.
[3:02:58.000 --> 3:02:59.400]  It's going forward.
[3:02:59.400 --> 3:03:04.360]  One misunderstanding out there is there's talk about recalling electors, all of that.
[3:03:04.360 --> 3:03:06.680]  That has no constitutional consequence.
[3:03:06.680 --> 3:03:11.400]  The president cannot be Donald Trump cannot be reinstated president constitutionally.
[3:03:11.400 --> 3:03:13.480]  There's no process for that to occur.
[3:03:13.480 --> 3:03:17.520]  The only way he gets back into the White House is if he wins in 2024.
[3:03:17.520 --> 3:03:23.200]  So that's 2 2.0 all the and I'm not against people that want to have reinstatement.
[3:03:23.200 --> 3:03:25.760]  I'm not against folks that want to have a focus on fraud.
[3:03:25.760 --> 3:03:26.920]  We need to get all that going.
[3:03:26.920 --> 3:03:31.240]  Let's just be honest about it so that when it doesn't happen, we don't look like fools.
[3:03:31.240 --> 3:03:32.240]  Exactly.
[3:03:32.240 --> 3:03:36.520]  That this is still incredibly valuable because only by increasing transparency, it kind of
[3:03:36.520 --> 3:03:37.960]  relates to the vaccine.
[3:03:37.960 --> 3:03:43.000]  Joe Biden, when he was running for the presidency, said you should never take a vaccine unless
[3:03:43.000 --> 3:03:47.200]  there is complete confidence and complete transparency by the government.
[3:03:47.200 --> 3:03:49.160]  Well, Biden hasn't kept his word on that.
[3:03:49.160 --> 3:03:53.960]  So by his own admission, by his own demonstration, people should have skepticism about the vaccine.
[3:03:53.960 --> 3:03:55.200]  And we should be able to use that in court.
[3:03:55.200 --> 3:03:57.280]  We should be able to use that in court.
[3:03:57.280 --> 3:03:58.280]  Absolutely.
[3:03:58.280 --> 3:03:59.280]  Oh, I'm going to be using it in court.
[3:03:59.280 --> 3:04:03.080]  I'll be using a lot of things he said, like he said, if you got the vaccine, you could
[3:04:03.080 --> 3:04:06.440]  not get the infection on CNN just a couple of weeks ago.
[3:04:06.440 --> 3:04:08.040]  So now all of a sudden you can.
[3:04:08.040 --> 3:04:12.600]  So there's been a lot of misrepresentations by this administration in the same capacity.
[3:04:12.600 --> 3:04:16.560]  We need transparency in elections and going through this audit process and documenting
[3:04:16.560 --> 3:04:19.880]  what happens is important for all future elections.
[3:04:19.880 --> 3:04:23.000]  And let's just say it's not about reinstating Trump.
[3:04:23.000 --> 3:04:26.400]  I mean, that that that's probably not going to happen.
[3:04:26.400 --> 3:04:30.800]  What we're saying is it's about exposing the 2022 getting states to pass laws, which is
[3:04:30.800 --> 3:04:35.320]  happening to have a fair real election then to stop the globalist.
[3:04:35.320 --> 3:04:40.160]  And it tremendously helps Trump if he's going to run in 2024 for people to know what really
[3:04:40.160 --> 3:04:41.920]  happened in 2020.
[3:04:41.920 --> 3:04:42.920]  So people should look.
[3:04:42.920 --> 3:04:46.760]  This has long term institutional remedies, which is what we need.
[3:04:46.760 --> 3:04:49.960]  Just getting Trump elected to office wasn't going to cure everything anyway.
[3:04:49.960 --> 3:04:52.320]  We need real institutional reform.
[3:04:52.320 --> 3:04:53.320]  And that's what these are.

[3:06:27.120 --> 3:06:48.200]  We are now in to our number four on this August 5th, Thursday, transmission author, researcher,
[3:06:48.200 --> 3:06:55.000]  Jay Dyer's coming up here in just a few minutes, but first, these videos prove Australia is
[3:06:55.000 --> 3:06:57.120]  a tyrannical police state.
[3:06:57.120 --> 3:07:01.440]  We opened the phones up yesterday for the nightmare calls from Australia.
[3:07:01.440 --> 3:07:03.640]  It sounded surreal.
[3:07:03.640 --> 3:07:07.240]  People being picked up, people being taken to FEMA camps, their own, for refusing an
[3:07:07.240 --> 3:07:08.240]  oculation.
[3:07:08.240 --> 3:07:09.840]  We got calls a year ago it was happening.
[3:07:09.840 --> 3:07:10.840]  I couldn't believe it.
[3:07:10.840 --> 3:07:14.800]  Then it was admitted on their news that it was happening.
[3:07:14.800 --> 3:07:22.560]  Well, the articles at infowars.com by Kelly McBrane, these videos prove Australia is a
[3:07:22.560 --> 3:07:24.480]  tyrannical police state.
[3:07:24.480 --> 3:07:26.760]  This is going in and getting out of cities.
[3:07:26.760 --> 3:07:31.000]  The police scanning your QR code that you are not more than three miles away from home.
[3:07:31.000 --> 3:07:35.400]  If not, you are assaulted and drug away.
[3:07:35.400 --> 3:07:40.880]  Here is the horrible footage of what's coming to the rest of the world under this UN model.
[3:07:40.880 --> 3:08:10.720]  The UN is directing it, here it is.
[3:08:10.720 --> 3:08:16.880]  All good?
[3:08:16.880 --> 3:08:19.320]  Scanning his QR code to make sure he's allowed to be out.
[3:08:19.320 --> 3:08:23.840]  I said I don't need to.
[3:08:23.840 --> 3:08:30.680]  I wasn't detained, was I?
[3:08:30.680 --> 3:08:31.680]  Was I detained?
[3:08:31.680 --> 3:08:32.680]  I wasn't detained.
[3:08:32.680 --> 3:08:34.880]  Well, I drove off because I wasn't detained.
[3:08:34.880 --> 3:08:36.200]  I was asking if you're a medical exemption.
[3:08:36.200 --> 3:08:37.200]  So now you're detaining me.
[3:08:37.200 --> 3:08:41.200]  You're your mask, the cult leader, the cops, the enemy of them, freedom.
[3:08:41.200 --> 3:08:42.200]  Smoke yourself in.
[3:08:42.200 --> 3:08:43.200]  Thank you.
[3:08:43.200 --> 3:08:44.200]  Are these people in this sack?
[3:08:44.200 --> 3:08:47.200]  They beat the cops at their own game.
[3:08:47.200 --> 3:08:49.200]  Oh, they do.
[3:08:49.200 --> 3:08:54.880]  Look at these cops.
[3:08:54.880 --> 3:08:55.880]  Look at them.
[3:08:55.880 --> 3:09:04.360]  They know they stacked crap that high.
[3:09:04.360 --> 3:09:05.360]  Welcome to the police state.
[3:09:05.360 --> 3:09:08.600]  I think you're playing games.
[3:09:08.600 --> 3:09:10.720]  I think you're wasting police resources.
[3:09:10.720 --> 3:09:11.720]  You're wasting police resources.
[3:09:11.720 --> 3:09:12.720]  Mate, you're inciting.
[3:09:12.720 --> 3:09:13.720]  Thank you.
[3:09:13.720 --> 3:09:14.720]  Have a good day, sir.
[3:09:14.720 --> 3:09:15.720]  There you go.
[3:09:15.720 --> 3:09:16.720]  That's how you win.
[3:09:16.720 --> 3:09:17.720]  That guy knows what he's doing.
[3:09:17.720 --> 3:09:18.720]  That's how you win, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:09:18.720 --> 3:09:19.720]  Hey, boys.
[3:09:19.720 --> 3:09:20.720]  I'm in the monastery.
[3:09:20.720 --> 3:09:21.720]  I'm building a church here.
[3:09:21.720 --> 3:09:22.720]  I think we could come down and give them a hand.
[3:09:22.720 --> 3:09:23.720]  I spent a Saturday here.
[3:09:23.720 --> 3:09:24.720]  Beautiful church.
[3:09:24.720 --> 3:09:25.720]  They do.
[3:09:25.720 --> 3:09:26.720]  No cops here.
[3:09:26.720 --> 3:09:27.720]  No lock at the other side.
[3:09:27.720 --> 3:09:35.720]  Incredible.
[3:09:35.720 --> 3:09:43.040]  Look at that guy.
[3:09:43.040 --> 3:09:44.040]  Wow.
[3:09:44.040 --> 3:09:45.040]  What a time to be alive.
[3:09:45.040 --> 3:09:46.040]  See the full videos.
[3:09:46.040 --> 3:09:47.040]  There's more.
[3:09:47.040 --> 3:09:49.240]  These videos, pre-Australia, is a tyrannical police state.
[3:09:49.240 --> 3:09:51.000]  It has nothing to do with the virus.
[3:09:51.000 --> 3:09:55.880]  It's all training you to be a slave ahead of a worldwide financial collapse.
[3:09:55.880 --> 3:09:58.640]  They've engineered for full control.
[3:09:58.640 --> 3:09:59.640]  What comes next?
[3:09:59.640 --> 3:10:01.140]  Well, the cyber shutdown.
[3:10:01.140 --> 3:10:02.140]  They've telegraphed it.
[3:10:02.140 --> 3:10:03.640]  They've got it ready.
[3:10:03.640 --> 3:10:07.320]  The date may change because we exposed it.
[3:10:07.320 --> 3:10:11.760]  But I have from a lot of sources, one of them Jack Pasovic, but the other one's.
[3:10:11.760 --> 3:10:15.000]  Jack's always accurate, but I made some calls.
[3:10:15.000 --> 3:10:19.720]  They're set to declare basically civil emergency, climate emergency, martial law on the 11th
[3:10:19.720 --> 3:10:24.160]  with this EAS alert and all the rest of it.
[3:10:24.160 --> 3:10:25.160]  I'm telling you, man.
[3:10:25.160 --> 3:10:33.680]  This is one hell of a time to be alive and they're announcing the worldwide IDs.
[3:10:33.680 --> 3:10:36.840]  Biden's going to announce the, the, the airport checklist.
[3:10:36.840 --> 3:10:37.840]  No fly list.
[3:10:37.840 --> 3:10:42.480]  If you haven't taken their deadly shot that isn't even approved, Nuremberg violating on
[3:10:42.480 --> 3:10:46.360]  its face.
[3:10:46.360 --> 3:10:47.360]  On its face.
[3:10:47.360 --> 3:10:53.400]  I mean, hey, well, let me, I'm not happy about this, but at least if we're going to go down
[3:10:53.400 --> 3:10:59.640]  in flames, we're, we're burning hot info wars has double the audience we ever had right
[3:10:59.640 --> 3:11:04.400]  now other than right before the election 2016, where he had like 87 million IP addresses
[3:11:04.400 --> 3:11:07.040]  in like three days or whatever come in.
[3:11:07.040 --> 3:11:10.400]  We have five million people watching right now on our streams.
[3:11:10.400 --> 3:11:14.560]  I mean, it's just all exploding and the enemy's pissed too.
[3:11:14.560 --> 3:11:17.360]  They can't stand what's going on, but your strength is amazing.
[3:11:17.360 --> 3:11:22.640]  Your humanity is amazing and I love you and I appreciate you and I feel your strength.
[3:11:22.640 --> 3:11:29.080]  So humanity gets it and there is a giant awakening happening right now.
[3:11:29.080 --> 3:11:34.480]  So all you got to do the millions and millions and millions and millions and millions of
[3:11:34.480 --> 3:11:40.960]  people watching me on August 5th, just take the live link from free world news.tv or band
[3:11:40.960 --> 3:11:45.360]  on video and on your Twitter, on your Facebook, on your email, on your text message say here
[3:11:45.360 --> 3:11:46.360]  it is.
[3:11:46.360 --> 3:11:49.480]  Here's the truth because it's, it's confirmed the vaccine doesn't work when you take the
[3:11:49.480 --> 3:11:54.160]  vaccine they want to give you more and then it's more control because you submit to them.
[3:11:54.160 --> 3:11:59.240]  They only intensify their attacks now.
[3:11:59.240 --> 3:12:03.760]  Great researcher, Greg Reese has put out a new emergency report.
[3:12:03.760 --> 3:12:05.240]  It's live at van dot video.
[3:12:05.240 --> 3:12:06.240]  I hope you share it.
[3:12:06.240 --> 3:12:08.680]  We're posting it to info wars dot com right now.
[3:12:08.680 --> 3:12:13.120]  The digital passport company literally run by Nazi companies.
[3:12:13.120 --> 3:12:21.240]  Here is the report right now.
[3:12:21.240 --> 3:12:26.640]  In a recent video, Polly St. George talks us through her recent investigation of the
[3:12:26.640 --> 3:12:33.240]  company in trust, a company who just recently signed a contract with the United Kingdom
[3:12:33.240 --> 3:12:38.600]  to provide digital passports for COVID-19 vaccine tracking.
[3:12:38.600 --> 3:12:44.280]  What she discovered was that the family who owns in trust not only has Nazi roots, but
[3:12:44.280 --> 3:12:48.080]  they are in fact a very prominent Nazi family.
[3:12:48.080 --> 3:12:51.080]  The family in question is the Quant family.
[3:12:51.080 --> 3:12:57.640]  In 1929, Günther Quant took over one of the largest arms manufacturers in Germany.
[3:12:57.640 --> 3:13:03.280]  He then divorced his second wife, Magda, who then married Joseph Goebbels just two years
[3:13:03.280 --> 3:13:05.680]  later in 1931.
[3:13:05.680 --> 3:13:10.800]  The Goebbels family then became heavily involved in the Quant family business.
[3:13:10.800 --> 3:13:16.800]  Maybe this was one of those instances of marriage to cement a business relationship, sort of
[3:13:16.800 --> 3:13:20.960]  like royalty does, but this is the new royalty.
[3:13:20.960 --> 3:13:23.040]  This is the industrialist royalty.
[3:13:23.040 --> 3:13:27.920]  This is the globalist regime being born.
[3:13:27.920 --> 3:13:29.600]  That's just a guess.
[3:13:29.600 --> 3:13:31.640]  Here's some photos from the wedding.
[3:13:31.640 --> 3:13:37.040]  Their marriage took place on a grand property owned by Günther Quant, where Adolf Hitler
[3:13:37.040 --> 3:13:39.400]  served as the best man.
[3:13:39.400 --> 3:13:45.960]  In 1933, Günther officially joined the Nazi party and was granted special privileges to
[3:13:45.960 --> 3:13:48.560]  use slave labor.
[3:13:48.560 --> 3:13:54.600]  Günther and his sons, Herbert and Harold, staffed their factories with over 50,000 prisoners
[3:13:54.600 --> 3:13:58.360]  of war and concentration camp workers.
[3:13:58.360 --> 3:14:04.040]  One of their factories even had its own concentration camp, an execution area.
[3:14:04.040 --> 3:14:07.640]  The end of World War II had little effect on the Quant family.
[3:14:07.640 --> 3:14:12.920]  A former prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials claims that there was plenty of evidence to
[3:14:12.920 --> 3:14:18.240]  prosecute the Quants and regrets how they were allowed to evade punishment.
[3:14:18.240 --> 3:14:23.320]  Not only did the Quants evade punishment at Nuremberg, Herbert went on as a director
[3:14:23.320 --> 3:14:29.800]  of Deutsche Bank, became an honorary citizen, and a czar of the whole German economy.
[3:14:29.800 --> 3:14:32.960]  He married Johanna Brun in 1960.
[3:14:32.960 --> 3:14:39.920]  They had two children, Stefan Quant and Suzanne Klatton, Germany's richest woman, who recently
[3:14:39.920 --> 3:14:44.400]  told reporters how difficult it is being a billionaire.
[3:14:44.400 --> 3:14:50.920]  Entrust was bought by the Quant family in 1987, has went on to gain contracts in banking
[3:14:50.920 --> 3:14:56.560]  and government, including just about every level of the US federal government, and has
[3:14:56.560 --> 3:15:02.240]  just signed a contract to provide digital passports for the UK.
[3:15:02.240 --> 3:15:08.360]  The Quant family weren't the only Nazi industrialists to go on after the war and thrive.
[3:15:08.360 --> 3:15:15.640]  IG Farben-Behr is the father of Big Pharma, and this ideology wasn't born with the Nazis.
[3:15:15.640 --> 3:15:23.440]  It comes from the Sabati and Frankist Rockefeller Rothschild banking empire, the ones who mysteriously
[3:15:23.440 --> 3:15:28.940]  create money and loan it to us with interest, as if they own it all.
[3:15:28.940 --> 3:15:34.400]  We know who they are, many of them are coming out of the shadows and offering us tyranny,
[3:15:34.400 --> 3:15:37.240]  and many of us are accepting the offer.
[3:15:37.240 --> 3:15:43.960]  And all we have to do to save our lives is say no to this criminal gang of psychotic
[3:15:43.960 --> 3:15:45.600]  vampires.
[3:15:45.600 --> 3:16:00.600]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[3:16:00.600 --> 3:16:04.680]  What if you could cut your heating bills this winter with your existing wood-burning fireplace
[3:16:04.680 --> 3:16:06.840]  and not spend thousands doing it?

[3:16:30.760 --> 3:16:34.880]  Hey everybody, confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture?
[3:16:34.880 --> 3:16:35.880]  Me too.
[3:16:35.880 --> 3:16:40.080]  Listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling, there's
[3:16:40.080 --> 3:16:42.800]  one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[3:16:42.800 --> 3:16:47.160]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[3:16:47.160 --> 3:16:48.880]  You probably already believe that.
[3:16:48.880 --> 3:16:50.080]  I certainly do.
[3:16:50.080 --> 3:16:51.080]  So here's the thing.
[3:16:51.080 --> 3:16:55.460]  I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances actually
[3:16:55.460 --> 3:16:59.480]  have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[3:16:59.480 --> 3:17:05.320]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at strongerdefence.com.

[3:17:29.440 --> 3:17:31.840]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[3:17:31.840 --> 3:17:35.760]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[3:17:35.760 --> 3:17:37.320]  I sued the IRS in one.
[3:17:37.320 --> 3:17:40.280]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[3:17:40.280 --> 3:17:43.520]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[3:17:43.520 --> 3:17:45.800]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[3:17:45.800 --> 3:17:47.120]  I can help you, too.

[3:20:04.360 --> 3:20:24.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:24.040 --> 3:20:29.120]  Hi, welcome to the final hour of the Alex Jones show on your guest host, Jay Dyer of
[3:20:29.120 --> 3:20:30.920]  Jay's Analysis.
[3:20:30.920 --> 3:20:35.040]  I think if we want to understand where we are today, the crisis that we're in, which
[3:20:35.040 --> 3:20:42.040]  is a manufactured crisis, we need to understand historic famous projects like MKUltra.
[3:20:42.040 --> 3:20:47.520]  A lot of people don't know the real authentic history of the various MKUltra projects of
[3:20:47.520 --> 3:20:51.920]  which there were dozens, not just in U.S. universities, but all over the globe.
[3:20:51.920 --> 3:20:56.320]  In fact, I'm going to show you some really amazing information in terms of the projects
[3:20:56.320 --> 3:21:02.680]  that were done even in Australia under the auspices of the U.S. government, U.S. military,
[3:21:02.680 --> 3:21:04.760]  and psychiatric institutions.
[3:21:04.760 --> 3:21:09.920]  When we look at that, we're going to understand how today's medical crisis ties directly into
[3:21:09.920 --> 3:21:16.080]  the history of MKUltra, which is a manufactured crisis, this medical crisis, as well as how
[3:21:16.080 --> 3:21:22.640]  this leads us into a technocracy because a lot of people don't know that today's crises
[3:21:22.640 --> 3:21:26.240]  come out of psychological warfare strategies and plans.
[3:21:26.240 --> 3:21:32.360]  Once we understand the strategy of how the elite have used wartime intelligence and wartime
[3:21:32.360 --> 3:21:40.640]  operations on the people, then we can completely decode and understand what's going on in this
[3:21:40.640 --> 3:21:44.520]  gigantic global psychological operation.
[3:21:44.520 --> 3:21:48.720]  The first thing we want to understand is that MKUltra is a famous series of projects that
[3:21:48.720 --> 3:21:55.880]  comes out of wartime intelligence and operations dealing with testing of the mind, mapping
[3:21:55.880 --> 3:22:01.440]  and monitoring, and completely controlling the mind in order to understand the inner
[3:22:01.440 --> 3:22:02.440]  sphere.
[3:22:02.440 --> 3:22:07.560]  So, in terms of the space race, the idea was let's colonize the outer sphere of the world,
[3:22:07.560 --> 3:22:13.520]  the existing universe, but then there's that crucial inner sphere, right, Freud, Young,
[3:22:13.520 --> 3:22:16.600]  the psychoanalysts, right, they wanted to conquer the inner sphere.
[3:22:16.600 --> 3:22:21.920]  Well, the military had the same idea, right, that it began with army projects to find a
[3:22:21.920 --> 3:22:26.800]  truth serum back in the 40s and 50s, and we have people like Bill Donovan, right, the
[3:22:26.800 --> 3:22:33.200]  famous OSS, a co-founder, you could say, of the OSS along with British intelligence,
[3:22:33.200 --> 3:22:37.720]  to figure out what are the ways that we could manipulate the mind of the enemy, right?
[3:22:37.720 --> 3:22:43.600]  So remember that wartime crisis situation, martial law situations always provide the
[3:22:43.600 --> 3:22:48.520]  excuse for how we can bypass normal laws, right?
[3:22:48.520 --> 3:22:54.240]  And these crises, right, what Brzezinski eventually would call an arc of crisis, right, all throughout
[3:22:54.240 --> 3:22:57.760]  the Soviet block states in the post-Cold War era.
[3:22:57.760 --> 3:23:01.800]  This model of crisis is what you see in every one of the global elite's writings.
[3:23:01.800 --> 3:23:06.800]  As you know, I've covered about 50 of them, going book by book by book, the last 100 years
[3:23:06.800 --> 3:23:08.560]  of the elite and their writings.
[3:23:08.560 --> 3:23:13.080]  Almost all of them begin their books by saying, we're in a crisis, this is the greatest crisis
[3:23:13.080 --> 3:23:16.360]  the world has ever seen, and it's all BS.
[3:23:16.360 --> 3:23:21.000]  But the pseudo crisis is actually typically something that they've engineered.
[3:23:21.000 --> 3:23:25.880]  Now everybody knows I think about false flags, so that's a wartime strategy that's a psychological
[3:23:25.880 --> 3:23:28.400]  operation to paint the enemy, sure.
[3:23:28.400 --> 3:23:33.840]  But what about mental false flags, what about attacks on the psyche, well, that's the domain
[3:23:33.840 --> 3:23:34.840]  of MKUltra.
[3:23:34.840 --> 3:23:39.400]  And a lot of doctors and psychologists and psychiatrists and even dentists, right, people
[3:23:39.400 --> 3:23:47.160]  that you wouldn't expect across the globe were recruited into these MKUltra projects
[3:23:47.160 --> 3:23:48.880]  and experiments.
[3:23:48.880 --> 3:23:51.400]  And again, it's all over the board what kinds of stuff they did.
[3:23:51.400 --> 3:23:53.160]  We don't even know all the stuff that they did.
[3:23:53.160 --> 3:23:59.720]  So we kind of have to piece together many decades later what we can based on the declassified
[3:23:59.720 --> 3:24:03.440]  documents that do exist, which supposedly are about half of those documents.
[3:24:03.440 --> 3:24:07.840]  I think Richard Helms destroyed the other half, seven boxes, there's seven that exist.
[3:24:07.840 --> 3:24:10.160]  So there's a lot of great books and materials.
[3:24:10.160 --> 3:24:13.600]  One of those is John Marx's book, Search for the Manusuring Candidate.
[3:24:13.600 --> 3:24:17.840]  There's a Walter Boertz book, Operation Mind Control.
[3:24:17.840 --> 3:24:20.760]  There's Dr. Colin Ross's book, The CIA Doctors.
[3:24:20.760 --> 3:24:24.360]  But what's interesting is that since these books were written in the late 70s and early
[3:24:24.360 --> 3:24:31.760]  80s and 90s, many other books and research has come out that demonstrates a lot more
[3:24:31.760 --> 3:24:36.560]  doctors and a lot more projects existed than we knew, even in other countries.
[3:24:36.560 --> 3:24:42.800]  And you're going to see how some of this ties into the so-called COVID crisis in a minute.
[3:24:42.800 --> 3:24:46.200]  And this is something I stumbled upon in the last couple of weeks that I've read most of
[3:24:46.200 --> 3:24:47.560]  these MK Ultra books.
[3:24:47.560 --> 3:24:48.560]  I didn't know this.
[3:24:48.560 --> 3:24:49.560]  This was pretty wild.
[3:24:49.560 --> 3:24:53.960]  But again, if we go back to the OSS wartime period, one of the things that they wanted
[3:24:53.960 --> 3:24:57.400]  to do was figure out personality assessments.
[3:24:57.400 --> 3:25:01.960]  Did you know that the personality maps and all that comes out of a guy named Dr. John
[3:25:01.960 --> 3:25:08.040]  Gittinger, who was the CIA's MK Ultra personality assessment doctor, he's the one that invented
[3:25:08.040 --> 3:25:13.080]  all of that personality stuff and classifying people under these hundreds of different types
[3:25:13.080 --> 3:25:15.000]  of personalities, right?
[3:25:15.000 --> 3:25:19.320]  And he wanted to find a perfectly scientific model doing this.
[3:25:19.320 --> 3:25:23.920]  He wasn't able to find a perfect technique, but he as an individual was able to train
[3:25:23.920 --> 3:25:28.600]  different CIA operatives and so forth in this technique, which was fairly successful, although
[3:25:28.600 --> 3:25:30.960]  it wasn't 100% scientifically accurate.
[3:25:30.960 --> 3:25:40.360]  But one thing that that sort of predated was the idea of a AI system to predict human choices
[3:25:40.360 --> 3:25:41.360]  and actions.
[3:25:41.360 --> 3:25:46.000]  And that will actually play into later tech, because as you'll see, the MK Ultra projects
[3:25:46.000 --> 3:25:50.720]  directly play into AI and transhumanism.
[3:25:50.720 --> 3:25:57.760]  Literally transhumanism comes directly out of the MK Search, MK Delta, MK Naomi projects
[3:25:57.760 --> 3:26:03.400]  that the CIA was operating under at Fort Detrick and other bases, right?
[3:26:03.400 --> 3:26:08.080]  And we'll see that it transitions into a bio warfare project.
[3:26:08.080 --> 3:26:11.840]  But Bill Donovan said, we need to figure out how to map the mind.
[3:26:11.840 --> 3:26:15.600]  And one thing that they did, believe it or not, if you follow my material, I've done
[3:26:15.600 --> 3:26:19.080]  a lot of research into the serial killers and how some of them were actually brought
[3:26:19.080 --> 3:26:25.240]  into projects that were also probably addendum projects to MK Ultra, which would be things
[3:26:25.240 --> 3:26:30.960]  like the Phoenix program during Vietnam where they literally recruited psychopaths, right?
[3:26:30.960 --> 3:26:35.920]  Literal psychopaths out of jails, prisons, out of military prisons, naval projects involving
[3:26:35.920 --> 3:26:36.920]  this, right?
[3:26:36.920 --> 3:26:42.680]  To figure out how to train and create psychopathic killers to terrorize the enemy.
[3:26:42.680 --> 3:26:48.000]  A lot of people think that those same projects would have been brought home domestically,
[3:26:48.000 --> 3:26:49.000]  right?
[3:26:49.000 --> 3:26:55.360]  There are things like MK Naomi, again, MK Search, Phoenix program where you have the releasing
[3:26:55.360 --> 3:27:00.920]  of kind of lunatics in the U.S. to create a kind of domestic destabilization program
[3:27:00.920 --> 3:27:03.600]  that's a psychological work for operation.
[3:27:03.600 --> 3:27:08.440]  Tom O'Neill, for example, just better put out a recent book, chronicling the history
[3:27:08.440 --> 3:27:14.680]  of Charles Manson, his connections to the CIA, different CIA figures and organized crime.
[3:27:14.680 --> 3:27:18.480]  There's substantial evidence to suggest, as I've said for a long time, that Charles Manson
[3:27:18.480 --> 3:27:23.040]  himself was essentially a product of some of these mind control experiments.
[3:27:23.040 --> 3:27:25.520]  We know that the Unabomber, right, was connected to MK Ultra.
[3:27:25.520 --> 3:27:27.000]  He volunteered for these.
[3:27:27.000 --> 3:27:32.280]  It's actually listed in his obituary, and yes, chaos has a lot of substantial evidence
[3:27:32.280 --> 3:27:33.520]  that demonstrates this.
[3:27:33.520 --> 3:27:38.560]  I believe Tom O'Neill's even been on Joe Rogan talking about that book, but if we go back
[3:27:38.560 --> 3:27:42.720]  to the MK Ultra projects, it's not surprising given that even the days of Bill Donovan,
[3:27:42.720 --> 3:27:48.000]  he said, what we need to do is find loonies, quote unquote, loonies, literal loonies, psychos
[3:27:48.000 --> 3:27:54.440]  and freaks who wanted to spy on and surveil and be involved in voyeurism, right, watching
[3:27:54.440 --> 3:27:55.440]  people.
[3:27:55.440 --> 3:27:59.280]  They would recruit loonies to do a lot of surveillance work, and not only that, they
[3:27:59.280 --> 3:28:04.280]  wanted to set up a specific program, and guess who was involved in this?
[3:28:04.280 --> 3:28:05.280]  AT&T.
[3:28:05.280 --> 3:28:12.520]  AT&T helped the early OSS set up a really intricate psychology assessment program where
[3:28:12.520 --> 3:28:18.080]  about personality assessments would become a new field of interest and research itself
[3:28:18.080 --> 3:28:22.400]  under American psychology, APA, these different institutes, right?
[3:28:22.400 --> 3:28:29.600]  And this was set up at the University of California at Berkeley, connected to the CIA and OSS
[3:28:29.600 --> 3:28:36.200]  through a figure named Murray, and this would later be the brainchild of Dr. John Gittinger.
[3:28:36.200 --> 3:28:42.160]  So again, remember the early stages of the OSS and MK Ultra were connected to corporate
[3:28:42.160 --> 3:28:50.200]  Fortune 100, AT&T, helping to set up these labs and these products at public state universities.
[3:28:50.200 --> 3:28:54.800]  So these are not independent spheres, there's the corporate sphere and there's the state
[3:28:54.800 --> 3:28:58.600]  and these are two, the libertarian, you know, they're going to balance each other out, it's
[3:28:58.600 --> 3:29:00.560]  a state, no, they work together.
[3:29:00.560 --> 3:29:06.880]  You know, listeners call into the cell and it makes me feel pathetic because I sit there
[3:29:06.880 --> 3:29:12.240]  and I beg you for support, constantly, for prayer, for financial support, and for word
[3:29:12.240 --> 3:29:16.520]  of mouth, and we're all this together, and you know, it gets old having to come to you
[3:29:16.520 --> 3:29:19.720]  and say, hey, I got great products, please buy them or we won't be here on air.
[3:29:19.720 --> 3:29:23.160]  But it's true, for the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty
[3:29:23.160 --> 3:29:27.800]  at this level that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors, and they've harassed and
[3:29:27.800 --> 3:29:31.520]  almost shut down everybody else, they crippled all the other groups, and we're still here
[3:29:31.520 --> 3:29:36.240]  and as this whole new world order comes out and we open, our credibility is going up,
[3:29:36.240 --> 3:29:39.920]  that's why we've got to be taken off air, that's why America has got to be taken down.
[3:29:39.920 --> 3:29:44.600]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved and America is still quasi-free, you can't
[3:29:44.600 --> 3:29:48.480]  have info wars has been proven right, be on air, with all the craziness that's about
[3:29:48.480 --> 3:29:52.880]  to unfold, because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready, so thank you all and
[3:29:52.880 --> 3:29:57.680]  get an infowarstore.com, get some great 2020 election shirts, supplements and so much more,
[3:29:57.680 --> 3:30:00.480]  they're wonderful products, and they support the info war, thank you.
[3:30:00.480 --> 3:30:04.960]  So what's the most important part, let's say in a bulldozer running over the globalist,
[3:30:04.960 --> 3:30:09.520]  the treads, the wheels, the engine, the scoop on the front, it's all very important, but
[3:30:09.520 --> 3:30:15.880]  the fuel is paramount, and that's my allegor, turbo force is vitamins, minerals, amino acids
[3:30:15.880 --> 3:30:20.360]  that synergistically work with six different natural forms of healthy clean energy that
[3:30:20.360 --> 3:30:24.480]  last for 10 hours in the average metabolic system, metabolism of a human, some people
[3:30:24.480 --> 3:30:28.680]  get 15 hours, some people get about 8 hours, but people take this, people take it in sports,
[3:30:28.680 --> 3:30:32.800]  people cannot believe it's the best they've ever had, because it's not hype, nobody puts
[3:30:32.800 --> 3:30:37.640]  as much product into their pre-workouts, their post-workouts, you can call us whatever
[3:30:37.640 --> 3:30:41.480]  you want, it's a total solution, all around the best you're going to find.
[3:30:41.480 --> 3:30:46.360]  Turbo force, without you, we don't roll, with you, we search forward together, it's like
[3:30:46.360 --> 3:30:50.080]  the bulldozer without the diesel fuel, if we don't have your financial support, we will
[3:30:50.080 --> 3:30:53.120]  be defeated, you support us to get products you already need that literally fuel your
[3:30:53.120 --> 3:31:01.080]  body and your mind, it's a win-win, 360 together, infowarstore.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[3:31:01.080 --> 3:31:05.440]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long, because they're supercomputers
[3:31:05.440 --> 3:31:09.720]  controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go when we do, but because
[3:31:09.720 --> 3:31:14.000]  they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate, I still
[3:31:14.000 --> 3:31:18.760]  have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean fire, has a lot of power, but when I'm not
[3:31:18.760 --> 3:31:25.120]  using it, I lock it up in a high quality Faraday cage, a privacy pocket at infowarstore.com,
[3:31:25.120 --> 3:31:29.400]  we finally got them back in stock, the highest rated, they fit almost all types of androids
[3:31:29.400 --> 3:31:37.120]  and iPhones at 50% off, $14.95, they sell these babies for $29.95 all day long, we've
[3:31:37.120 --> 3:31:44.480]  got a private label for them, for $14.95, because I want you to get them, and I want
[3:31:44.480 --> 3:31:49.480]  you to buy friends and family, these systems, to educate them about what these, quote, smartphones
[3:31:49.480 --> 3:31:53.720]  really are, this is a great way to limit your phone time use, it's a great way to spend
[3:31:53.720 --> 3:31:57.120]  more time with your family, and it's a great way to know you're not being tracked by the
[3:31:57.120 --> 3:32:02.120]  criminal global system, they're 50% off right now at infowarstore.com, it is through our
[3:32:02.120 --> 3:32:07.960]  five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told, and the
[3:32:07.960 --> 3:32:13.040]  only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses, which is why fluoridated
[3:32:13.040 --> 3:32:18.440]  water is a big problem, consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around
[3:32:18.440 --> 3:32:23.480]  the pineal gland, and shuts down its natural functions, natural functions which have been
[3:32:23.480 --> 3:32:28.880]  known for millennia, the hindu chakras align with the endocrine system, the chakra aligned
[3:32:28.880 --> 3:32:34.520]  with the pineal gland is the third eye, also described as the seat of the soul, the pineal
[3:32:34.520 --> 3:32:40.440]  gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness, and otherwise unseen dimensions
[3:32:40.440 --> 3:32:47.000]  of reality, fluoride free water is essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy, our water
[3:32:47.000 --> 3:32:52.960]  filtration systems with the proper filters will keep your drinking water fluoride free,
[3:32:52.960 --> 3:32:57.960]  the appropriate shower head will seal the deal, get them both today for yourself or
[3:32:57.960 --> 3:33:03.640]  a friend at infowarstore.com.
[3:33:03.640 --> 3:33:07.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:07.800 --> 3:33:24.640]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show, be sure and support this independent alternative spearhead
[3:33:24.640 --> 3:33:29.600]  operation against the enemy by getting the products in the info war store.
[3:33:29.600 --> 3:33:35.680]  You can also support me by going to jasonisles.com and subscribing to the vast archive of hundreds
[3:33:35.680 --> 3:33:40.800]  of talks and lectures over the last five years, encompassing all of this kind of material,
[3:33:40.800 --> 3:33:41.800]  and much more.
[3:33:41.800 --> 3:33:48.480]  Now we were talking about the OSS original plan to map the mind, right, to understand
[3:33:48.480 --> 3:33:54.400]  the human mental domain, and then to control it, and we were talking about how the early
[3:33:54.400 --> 3:34:01.520]  studies involved things like researching entheogens, right, Gordon Watson, JP Morgan's man went
[3:34:01.520 --> 3:34:07.640]  down to Latin South America and found the correct mushrooms that could be then synthesized
[3:34:07.640 --> 3:34:13.960]  and turned into these various LSD type drugs, these various hallucinogens that the CIA would
[3:34:13.960 --> 3:34:19.600]  then kind of let loose in various counterculture projects in the 1960s through their operatives
[3:34:19.600 --> 3:34:22.720]  like Tim Leary, Terrence McKenna and others.
[3:34:22.720 --> 3:34:25.440]  And yes, Terrence McKenna was a huge operative.
[3:34:25.440 --> 3:34:28.480]  It's very obvious if you go and watch his materials.
[3:34:28.480 --> 3:34:33.360]  If you watch Terrence McKenna, for example, in his lectures where he talks to the mushroom,
[3:34:33.360 --> 3:34:38.760]  Terrence McKenna says that the mushroom says we need to have less babies in the West.
[3:34:38.760 --> 3:34:40.880]  There's too many babies.
[3:34:40.880 --> 3:34:45.880]  So please listen to the mushroom God and stop having babies.
[3:34:45.880 --> 3:34:46.880]  That's literally what he says.
[3:34:46.880 --> 3:34:48.120]  Go watch the mushroom video.
[3:34:48.120 --> 3:34:49.480]  Now why was he saying that?
[3:34:49.480 --> 3:34:50.480]  Because guess what?
[3:34:50.480 --> 3:34:51.720]  It's all the same plan.
[3:34:51.720 --> 3:34:54.480]  All of this stuff is not just transhumanism.
[3:34:54.480 --> 3:34:57.000]  It's not just cultural degradation and mind control.
[3:34:57.000 --> 3:35:01.240]  It's also intended to toxify the culture so that you don't reproduce.
[3:35:01.240 --> 3:35:02.240]  That's it.
[3:35:02.240 --> 3:35:03.240]  That's the whole game plan here.
[3:35:03.240 --> 3:35:04.240]  You don't reproduce.
[3:35:04.240 --> 3:35:09.040]  The elite will then take that technology, become divine, or so they think, download
[3:35:09.040 --> 3:35:11.760]  into the model list.
[3:35:11.760 --> 3:35:13.240]  That's what 2001 is about.
[3:35:13.240 --> 3:35:18.040]  Alex did a great show this week talking about the long-term game plan of the tech elite,
[3:35:18.040 --> 3:35:23.640]  the transhumanists, which is if you watch 2001, don't forget to also watch 2010.
[3:35:23.640 --> 3:35:25.960]  Now, it's not that great of a movie.
[3:35:25.960 --> 3:35:28.960]  It's a pretty bad follow-up.
[3:35:28.960 --> 3:35:36.040]  However, the median message of 2010, which is unfollowed by 3,010 of Arthur C. Clarke.
[3:35:36.040 --> 3:35:42.400]  As Alex was saying this week, Clarke was hanging out with Crowley and a bunch of the creepers.
[3:35:42.400 --> 3:35:51.560]  The message of 2010 is that the Cold War was a dialectic to spur on the next phase of humanity
[3:35:51.560 --> 3:35:58.080]  into the fourth industrial revolution, which is the next type of civilization, literally
[3:35:58.080 --> 3:35:59.200]  star-trial levels.
[3:35:59.200 --> 3:36:00.840]  They want to be star-trial.
[3:36:00.840 --> 3:36:06.120]  They want to be gigantic, creepy, floating babies in space, nuking planets, literally.
[3:36:06.120 --> 3:36:07.120]  That's the plan.
[3:36:07.120 --> 3:36:09.640]  I'm not joking.
[3:36:09.640 --> 3:36:12.280]  Going back to MKULTRA, we're going to get there.
[3:36:12.280 --> 3:36:13.280]  We're going to get to MKULTRA.
[3:36:13.280 --> 3:36:16.800]  I got to tell you something crazy about the MKULTRA projects in Australia.
[3:36:16.800 --> 3:36:22.800]  I've got some crazy stuff about MKULTRA in Australia, talking about cannibalism, Mike.
[3:36:22.800 --> 3:36:23.800]  Crocky.
[3:36:23.800 --> 3:36:25.800]  It's going to be wild.
[3:36:25.800 --> 3:36:31.320]  Hypnotism, mind control, disassociation, depersonalization.
[3:36:31.320 --> 3:36:34.920]  What are we seeing in some of these shots in the research?
[3:36:34.920 --> 3:36:38.280]  The stabs, depersonalization, prions.
[3:36:38.280 --> 3:36:40.240]  Guess where that comes from?
[3:36:40.240 --> 3:36:46.120]  Bio-warfare research under MKULTRA, yes, literally.
[3:36:46.120 --> 3:36:50.040]  They didn't just want to figure out how to map the mind, how to split the mind.
[3:36:50.040 --> 3:36:55.200]  All the way back in the 1940s, Dr. Esther Brooks had the ability to hypnotize susceptible
[3:36:55.200 --> 3:36:59.000]  people to become hypnotic couriers.
[3:36:59.000 --> 3:37:04.320]  That's where we get the pop culture imagery of things like Manchurian candidate, the Frankenheimer
[3:37:04.320 --> 3:37:08.680]  book, the programmed MKULTRA assassin, that kind of stuff.
[3:37:08.680 --> 3:37:13.040]  If you've never seen a movie like La Femme Nequita, or the Luc Besson movie, it's a great
[3:37:13.040 --> 3:37:18.560]  example of this where you have basically a government, a secret government project that
[3:37:18.560 --> 3:37:24.800]  brings in psychopaths, right, Nequita, the girl that they recruit is this psychopathic
[3:37:24.800 --> 3:37:26.960]  drug addict girl off of the street.
[3:37:26.960 --> 3:37:28.480]  They take her to an underground base.
[3:37:28.480 --> 3:37:33.800]  They spend about four years training her, not just in assassination attempts, but in
[3:37:33.800 --> 3:37:37.080]  also becoming a honey trap.
[3:37:37.080 --> 3:37:42.760]  There's a Giselle Maxwell type woman that works for the state to train the girls to
[3:37:42.760 --> 3:37:45.600]  become sex operatives.
[3:37:45.600 --> 3:37:46.760]  Very revealing movie.
[3:37:46.760 --> 3:37:47.960]  And then they send her out.
[3:37:47.960 --> 3:37:54.880]  She's under total control to do whatever the deep state, the government, the secret service
[3:37:54.880 --> 3:37:55.880]  wants, right?
[3:37:55.880 --> 3:37:56.880]  It's a great film.
[3:37:56.880 --> 3:37:58.480]  I highly recommend it.
[3:37:58.480 --> 3:38:03.320]  And it's not so much that there's all of these programmed assassins that does exist.
[3:38:03.320 --> 3:38:08.480]  But remember, all of this research from the MKULTRA projects, from all this wartime psychological
[3:38:08.480 --> 3:38:15.600]  work for operation stuff, wasn't so much about individuals being mind controlled, the Hollywood
[3:38:15.600 --> 3:38:17.720]  image.
[3:38:17.720 --> 3:38:22.840]  It was actually about using all of that research and that data upon the whole society.
[3:38:22.840 --> 3:38:30.600]  So remember that whatever is true of the microcosm, the individual, can be extrapolated
[3:38:30.600 --> 3:38:34.440]  to the macrocosm, the society as a whole.
[3:38:34.440 --> 3:38:38.880]  This is an ancient platonic principle, right?
[3:38:38.880 --> 3:38:42.520]  Plato said that the city state is like a man.
[3:38:42.520 --> 3:38:44.360]  It's like a guy.
[3:38:44.360 --> 3:38:47.480]  It's like a big body of a dude, right?
[3:38:47.480 --> 3:38:49.480]  In our society, it would be a really big dude, right?
[3:38:49.480 --> 3:38:51.920]  Because everybody has a really bad diet, right?
[3:38:51.920 --> 3:38:58.680]  So in this system, Plato thinks that there's a three-tiered structure that the elite, the
[3:38:58.680 --> 3:39:04.680]  philosophical elite, the technocrats, that's his idea, they represent the mind.
[3:39:04.680 --> 3:39:09.240]  The guardian class, the warriors represent the heart because they have courage, the virtue
[3:39:09.240 --> 3:39:10.360]  of courage.
[3:39:10.360 --> 3:39:13.440]  And then the workers, the pros, they represent the body, right?
[3:39:13.440 --> 3:39:14.920]  Because they're out there doing the hard labor.
[3:39:14.920 --> 3:39:20.640]  And he thinks that the whole society is like a body, like a big dude, a big guy.
[3:39:20.640 --> 3:39:24.760]  And that whatever you learn about the individual, you can then take that information, whether
[3:39:24.760 --> 3:39:33.280]  it's positive research that can help or warfare, mental psychological research, you can weaponize
[3:39:33.280 --> 3:39:38.200]  that and it can become an attack on the entire population.
[3:39:38.200 --> 3:39:40.080]  So Plato's important for this kind of stuff.
[3:39:40.080 --> 3:39:42.960]  Plato's one of the first mind control operatives.
[3:39:42.960 --> 3:39:45.960]  We think of the allegory of the cave as you see here, right?
[3:39:45.960 --> 3:39:50.200]  What's the point of the allegory of the cave is that you can train the people that they
[3:39:50.200 --> 3:39:55.080]  will actually love their servitude, Alice Huxley, and they will want to stay in the
[3:39:55.080 --> 3:39:56.080]  cave.
[3:39:56.080 --> 3:40:01.160]  They will want to stay transfixed by the shadow images dancing on the wall.
[3:40:01.160 --> 3:40:03.480]  They will love their chains.
[3:40:03.480 --> 3:40:04.680]  They don't want to leave the cave.
[3:40:04.680 --> 3:40:14.760]  And the guy who's left the cave to see reality, the Socrates, the Jesus, and Alex Jones.
[3:40:14.760 --> 3:40:16.000]  I'm not trying to equate everybody.
[3:40:16.000 --> 3:40:18.920]  I'm not saying Alex Jones is a Socrates is a Jesus.
[3:40:18.920 --> 3:40:23.680]  I'm just saying that that, that archetype, that image of the guy who comes to tell you
[3:40:23.680 --> 3:40:28.080]  the truth, whether it's about the Cupid nonsense that we're undergoing now, or whether it's
[3:40:28.080 --> 3:40:33.320]  about, you know, Christianity or whatever, typically the message of the apology, the
[3:40:33.320 --> 3:40:37.400]  message of the allegory of the cave is that a lot of people don't want it, right?
[3:40:37.400 --> 3:40:42.280]  You can entrain people such that they will love the servitude that we addicted to their
[3:40:42.280 --> 3:40:43.280]  passions.
[3:40:43.280 --> 3:40:44.280]  And guess what?
[3:40:44.280 --> 3:40:50.200]  I did a C.I.A. MKLTRA research, which John Marx has a big essay about, John Gittinger
[3:40:50.200 --> 3:40:53.120]  and the Personality Assessment Systems.
[3:40:53.120 --> 3:40:59.720]  That was all about mapping human desires and controlling people through their basic needs
[3:40:59.720 --> 3:41:00.720]  and desires.
[3:41:00.720 --> 3:41:04.560]  I've heard Alex for years mention learned helplessness.
[3:41:04.560 --> 3:41:05.560]  And I didn't even realize.
[3:41:05.560 --> 3:41:10.600]  I just thought this was a term that, you know, that Alex is always repeating as a kind of
[3:41:10.600 --> 3:41:15.680]  helpful way to encapsulate how they put everybody into this arrested development state.
[3:41:15.680 --> 3:41:20.720]  I didn't realize that learned helplessness actually comes from Dr. Abraham Maslow, who
[3:41:20.720 --> 3:41:22.800]  was an MKLTRA doctor.
[3:41:22.800 --> 3:41:30.800]  Yes, MKLTRA is who, the projects, that's what came up with the idea of learned helplessness
[3:41:30.800 --> 3:41:33.840]  and the idea of weaponizing your base desires.
[3:41:33.840 --> 3:41:39.480]  Again, something Plato understood that the masses, the proles can be controlled through
[3:41:39.480 --> 3:41:47.040]  food, sex, fear, security, housing, basic desires.
[3:41:47.040 --> 3:41:53.880]  The technocratic model has just adopted every pattern of control system in history that
[3:41:53.880 --> 3:41:55.040]  actually worked.
[3:41:55.040 --> 3:42:00.080]  They don't care about the ideology except for a few things, transhumanism, Darwinism,
[3:42:00.080 --> 3:42:04.240]  depopulation, those things are the keys, right?
[3:42:04.240 --> 3:42:07.640]  Everything else, all they care about is what works, okay?
[3:42:07.640 --> 3:42:13.440]  So Platonism, democracy, because democracy is about controlling the base desires through
[3:42:13.440 --> 3:42:18.680]  the masses, the collective, communism, socialism, anything that works in those systems, including
[3:42:18.680 --> 3:42:26.560]  monopolistic capitalism, including Sovietism, including Western neoliberal degeneracy, all
[3:42:26.560 --> 3:42:34.840]  of those things, they just take what works and they put it into a giant ball of technocratic
[3:42:34.840 --> 3:42:37.360]  glob system, the blob system.
[3:42:37.360 --> 3:42:41.880]  That's what we're being integrated into, the blob, go watch the blob, same principle
[3:42:41.880 --> 3:42:42.880]  here, right?
[3:42:42.880 --> 3:42:51.000]  And it all comes out of this OSS, M-Kiltra, Mind Control, Personality Assessment Control
[3:42:51.000 --> 3:42:52.000]  Systems.
[3:42:52.000 --> 3:42:57.800]  Yes, exactly what you see in these tyrannical regimes, guess what, it's the same here.
[3:42:57.800 --> 3:43:14.600]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[3:43:14.600 --> 3:43:28.840]  Infowars has been banned, arrested, attacked and threatened, because we are effective.
[3:43:28.840 --> 3:43:37.520]  The great awakening is here, go to banned.video, download the videos and share.
[3:43:37.520 --> 3:43:54.480]  The information war at infowarstore.com and never give up the fight.
[3:43:54.480 --> 3:44:01.880]  Infowars.com.
[3:44:01.880 --> 3:44:06.280]  The globalists are having their revolution, but free humanity has to have its revolution.
[3:44:06.280 --> 3:44:15.240]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers, trying to enslave the entire biological
[3:44:15.240 --> 3:44:24.680]  processes of humans and turn us into these artificial, corporate, controlled slaves,
[3:44:24.680 --> 3:44:25.680]  Orson slaves.
[3:44:25.680 --> 3:44:32.400]  It's just property from cradle to grave of the system, rendered down to be servile minions
[3:44:32.400 --> 3:44:36.960]  of the system and a ritual of dominance and satanic control.
[3:44:36.960 --> 3:44:42.200]  We have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world, which relies on the nightmare dystopia
[3:44:42.200 --> 3:44:46.360]  and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[3:44:46.360 --> 3:44:51.240]  It's that choice, it's that realization that's going to change the world.
[3:44:51.240 --> 3:44:55.600]  And it's the only choice we've got, freedom or slavery, go to evil.
[3:44:55.600 --> 3:45:01.640]  It is a spiritual battle, and Infowars is at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[3:45:01.640 --> 3:45:04.760]  Liberty has been domesticated by and large.
[3:45:04.760 --> 3:45:08.520]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all going to
[3:45:08.520 --> 3:45:09.520]  pass.
[3:45:09.520 --> 3:45:13.160]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach
[3:45:13.160 --> 3:45:17.360]  a point where all the training is just beta, and you go into the point of being cold, being
[3:45:17.360 --> 3:45:18.560]  totally enslaved.
[3:45:18.560 --> 3:45:22.160]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making
[3:45:22.160 --> 3:45:23.160]  that move.
[3:45:23.160 --> 3:45:27.160]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with
[3:45:27.160 --> 3:45:32.800]  their world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis, under
[3:45:32.800 --> 3:45:37.720]  such a load, capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that
[3:45:37.720 --> 3:45:43.400]  they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees, not fleeing COVID or climate
[3:45:43.400 --> 3:45:48.000]  change, as the UN and Klaus Schwab are saying, and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the
[3:45:48.000 --> 3:45:54.000]  year long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't
[3:45:54.000 --> 3:45:59.840]  get more IMF and World Bank money, and that's why we have to really get educated about the
[3:45:59.840 --> 3:46:00.840]  globalist.
[3:46:00.840 --> 3:46:06.080]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that
[3:46:06.080 --> 3:46:07.080]  I've ever done.

[3:46:11.800 --> 3:46:14.280]  in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[3:46:14.280 --> 3:46:17.040]  Well, it's all come down to this.

[3:47:04.480 --> 3:47:12.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:47:12.280 --> 3:47:20.040]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:47:20.040 --> 3:47:25.360]  If you're interested in this kind of information in a full-on book format, you can also buy
[3:47:25.360 --> 3:47:30.640]  my books at jasonalysis.com in the shop, and you get signed copies.
[3:47:30.640 --> 3:47:31.720]  Don't get those from Amazon.
[3:47:31.720 --> 3:47:33.400]  Get them directly from me.
[3:47:33.400 --> 3:47:36.400]  Please don't support Jeff Bezos.
[3:47:36.400 --> 3:47:40.360]  So let's come to this conclusion here where we're talking about the manipulation of fear
[3:47:40.360 --> 3:47:45.120]  in society through the hierarchy of needs through learned helplessness.
[3:47:45.120 --> 3:47:50.280]  To put you in a state of perpetual fear, you've probably heard David Ike talk about this in
[3:47:50.280 --> 3:47:51.280]  his videos.
[3:47:51.280 --> 3:47:54.640]  He's correct about this, right?
[3:47:54.640 --> 3:47:59.880]  The control of that yeoman is through his base desires, and this was something that
[3:47:59.880 --> 3:48:04.760]  they mapped out in terms of all these mkltra doctors and researchers, many of whom I didn't
[3:48:04.760 --> 3:48:09.640]  actually know until very recently were just sort of main people who thought were mainline
[3:48:09.640 --> 3:48:15.000]  doctors, psychologists, people who pioneered things like positive thinking, positive Buddhism.
[3:48:15.000 --> 3:48:17.720]  Those all actually come out of the mkltra projects.
[3:48:17.720 --> 3:48:22.960]  In fact, there's a famous character by the name of Sir Gustav Nossal, who I think was
[3:48:22.960 --> 3:48:24.200]  a Nobel Prize winner.
[3:48:24.200 --> 3:48:27.520]  He's very famous in terms of immunology.
[3:48:27.520 --> 3:48:28.520]  Guess what?
[3:48:28.520 --> 3:48:33.400]  He's directly connected to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and he was connected to
[3:48:33.400 --> 3:48:41.440]  a lot of these operations in Australia over many decades involving mkltra research there,
[3:48:41.440 --> 3:48:46.520]  under the various universities, the various psychiatric institutions, and another key
[3:48:46.520 --> 3:48:50.480]  figure in the mkltra operations in Australia was Leonard Huxley.
[3:48:50.480 --> 3:48:54.440]  Yes, there's another member of the Huxley family you probably heard about, Aldous and
[3:48:54.440 --> 3:48:55.440]  Julian.
[3:48:55.440 --> 3:49:01.960]  Well, they had another apostle who went forth to spread that satanic gospel to other countries
[3:49:01.960 --> 3:49:08.080]  like other continents like Australia, and Sir Gustav Nossal, excuse me, not only Sir
[3:49:08.080 --> 3:49:16.560]  Gustav Nossal, but also Leonard Huxley, a bunch of other famous doctors there, Dr. Ronald
[3:49:16.560 --> 3:49:22.000]  Taft, Dr. Robert Goodnow, Dr. Sidney Gottlieb, Dr. John Phillips Sutcliff, William Sargon,
[3:49:22.000 --> 3:49:29.600]  Robert Heath, Dr. Hans Isink, Dr. Harvey Bailey, Gregory Bateson, Margaret Mead, Dr.
[3:49:29.600 --> 3:49:35.920]  Kurt Lewin, Kurt Lewin of Tabastock, yes, so direct connection between Tabastock and mkltra
[3:49:35.920 --> 3:49:41.160]  operations in Australia, and what we find out is through different fronts, like the
[3:49:41.160 --> 3:49:47.000]  Human Ecology Fund and Air Force Biowarfare Research down there, they found a perfect
[3:49:47.000 --> 3:49:56.160]  way to continue eugenics research, Dr. Isink, Sir Gustav Nossal, by studying certain tribes.
[3:49:56.160 --> 3:50:03.160]  Can you guess what they wanted to do through studying tribes, just blew me away.
[3:50:03.160 --> 3:50:08.680]  One of the things they wanted to do was set up a base in Australia to study aborigines
[3:50:08.680 --> 3:50:15.960]  and people in Papua New Guinea, and the reason they were so interested in Papua New Guinea
[3:50:15.960 --> 3:50:21.400]  was that they discovered a certain kind of thing that happens when you eat people.
[3:50:21.400 --> 3:50:28.840]  It's called Kuru disease, or mad cow disease, prion disease.
[3:50:28.840 --> 3:50:36.840]  That was discovered through studying cannibal tribes under mkltra biowarfare projects.
[3:50:36.840 --> 3:50:40.160]  These projects were connected to the Jason group, which you've probably heard about before
[3:50:40.160 --> 3:50:46.400]  if you've listened to my talks on DARPA and the Rand Corporation, a lot of elite technocrats,
[3:50:46.400 --> 3:50:50.280]  scientists, mathematicians, and engineers involved in the Jason group.
[3:50:50.280 --> 3:50:51.760]  They said, you know what?
[3:50:51.760 --> 3:50:57.080]  There's an interesting way that eating people kind of makes you go nuts, kind of causes
[3:50:57.080 --> 3:50:59.720]  you to do a lot of weird things.
[3:50:59.720 --> 3:51:01.040]  You go crazy.
[3:51:01.040 --> 3:51:03.600]  You turn into a kind of zombie.
[3:51:03.600 --> 3:51:10.600]  You turn into a shaking neurological mess, and I'm not trying to be crude here.
[3:51:10.600 --> 3:51:16.440]  This was under the auspices of eugenics research, but as we all know, after World War II, eugenics
[3:51:16.440 --> 3:51:22.160]  research got a bad name, so they renamed it these other projects.
[3:51:22.160 --> 3:51:27.640]  Just name it something else, right, a simple sales pitch, bait and switch.
[3:51:27.640 --> 3:51:31.840]  The American Eugenics Society, all these different characters, were interested in figuring how
[3:51:31.840 --> 3:51:40.920]  to weaponize Kuru mad cow disease, and who are the people involved in this?
[3:51:40.920 --> 3:51:48.800]  People on the Gates Foundation, like Sir Gustav Nuss, do you see what's going on here?
[3:51:48.800 --> 3:51:55.000]  This is a bio warfare thing that they figured out through in-culture research, mind control,
[3:51:55.000 --> 3:52:01.240]  which keep in mind it's not just about, again, splitting your personality, causing dissociation.
[3:52:01.240 --> 3:52:02.240]  That's part of this.
[3:52:02.240 --> 3:52:07.160]  That's part of what toxic pop culture does, literally is to create a dissociative state
[3:52:07.160 --> 3:52:13.040]  in the consumers of pop culture, and consuming, right?
[3:52:13.040 --> 3:52:22.280]  Pop culture is intended to destroy you, and so it's weaponized, but it's also, these projects
[3:52:22.280 --> 3:52:31.160]  are also interested in genetic destruction, genetic research to destroy genomes, and so
[3:52:31.160 --> 3:52:35.720]  what they did was they would recruit the best and the brightest of the scientific elites
[3:52:35.720 --> 3:52:42.720]  through Fulbright scholarships, headed up by people involved in the CFR, people like
[3:52:42.720 --> 3:52:50.560]  Eliehu Root, and remember all these people are 100% eugenicists, they're all into dysgenics,
[3:52:50.560 --> 3:52:58.400]  which is the weaponizing of genetics to destabilize populations, to reduce populations, ultimately
[3:52:58.400 --> 3:53:03.200]  as we know, to achieve ZPG, zero population growth.
[3:53:03.200 --> 3:53:09.040]  There's even a dystopian movie in the 70s called ZPG, zero population growth.
[3:53:09.040 --> 3:53:10.480]  Why were they putting this stuff out?
[3:53:10.480 --> 3:53:17.080]  Because that's the plan, and so the mutations and the neurological effects of the bio-warfare
[3:53:17.080 --> 3:53:25.800]  programs under MKUltra would just manifest into something else that would morph into
[3:53:25.800 --> 3:53:33.160]  MKDelta, MKSearch, and bio-warfare research, and that way it was no longer something that
[3:53:33.160 --> 3:53:37.600]  was seen as taboo.
[3:53:37.600 --> 3:53:44.000]  It's no longer Nazi paperclip stuff, it's something else, and guess how many paperclip
[3:53:44.000 --> 3:53:55.400]  scientists went to Australia, 127 Nazi paperclip scientists ended up in Australia doing this
[3:53:55.400 --> 3:53:57.040]  kind of research.
[3:53:57.040 --> 3:54:04.720]  Now it's not just Nazis, because the Soviets had their own projects, their own sci-sci PSY
[3:54:04.720 --> 3:54:10.360]  studying occult, studying mind control research, there's a great article by my friend Mark
[3:54:10.360 --> 3:54:13.640]  Hackard called the Soviet Sci-Spies.
[3:54:13.640 --> 3:54:18.360]  They were doing the exact same thing, and guess what, the Soviets took in Nazi paperclip
[3:54:18.360 --> 3:54:23.480]  scientists as did the British, as did the United States.
[3:54:23.480 --> 3:54:28.880]  So don't be fooled into the dialectics of the wartime period, because the overarching
[3:54:28.880 --> 3:54:38.160]  plan was about the erecting of a global technocracy, and the setting up of entities like the United
[3:54:38.160 --> 3:54:45.560]  Nations, UNESCO, connected to people like the Huxleys, connected to British intelligence,
[3:54:45.560 --> 3:54:54.760]  all working with people like Dr. Hans Eisink, famous geneticist, and guess what, Dr. Hans
[3:54:54.760 --> 3:55:05.480]  Eisink, the famous geneticist, was working on MK Ultra Subproject 111, and this was dealing
[3:55:05.480 --> 3:55:12.120]  with multiple personality DID research.
[3:55:12.120 --> 3:55:17.800]  So they've been at this for a long time, and they're not just studying MPDDID to help
[3:55:17.800 --> 3:55:21.120]  old people with Alzheimer's.
[3:55:21.120 --> 3:55:25.840]  These people want most of the planet dead, they don't care about your health, right?
[3:55:25.840 --> 3:55:27.560]  Health for them means you dying.
[3:55:27.560 --> 3:55:32.160]  So yes, in a sense they care about your health, because your health needs to end, right?
[3:55:32.160 --> 3:55:37.320]  When your health ends, the planet gets healthy, you see.
[3:55:37.320 --> 3:55:41.600]  Harry Bailey, you want to get an idea of one of these people, I mentioned Dr. Harry Bailey,
[3:55:41.600 --> 3:55:45.200]  one of the MK Ultra doctors, guess what, he's a serial killer.
[3:55:45.200 --> 3:55:53.160]  Yes, a famous serial killer, not just MK Ultra doctors studying serial killers, one of the
[3:55:53.160 --> 3:55:55.880]  MK Ultra doctors is a serial killer.
[3:55:55.880 --> 3:55:59.480]  I mean, I've been studying serial killers for a long time, I didn't know this, okay?
[3:55:59.480 --> 3:56:02.640]  I just found that this is like, what, is that crazy?
[3:56:02.640 --> 3:56:06.760]  It's always 10 times crazier than you think, right?
[3:56:06.760 --> 3:56:16.760]  Dr. Harry Bailey runs this big mental institute testing out mind control projects and death
[3:56:16.760 --> 3:56:24.200]  research basically, and he ends up killing most of the hospital, the mental institute.
[3:56:24.200 --> 3:56:28.360]  So I mean, he's classed as one of the famous serial killers, go look him up, he's connected
[3:56:28.360 --> 3:56:31.760]  to all these other MK Ultra doctors, these people are just psychos.
[3:56:31.760 --> 3:56:35.840]  And remember what Bill Donovan said, less, we want to recruit psychos, we want to recruit
[3:56:35.840 --> 3:56:36.840]  loonies.
[3:56:36.840 --> 3:56:44.960]  In fact, in John Marx's excellent analysis of the MAPS program, Dr. John Gittinger, again,
[3:56:44.960 --> 3:56:50.680]  the personality assessment guy, they eventually got to the point where they had it down to
[3:56:50.680 --> 3:57:01.440]  a science as to how to conduct the entrapment operations to compromise basically anybody.
[3:57:01.440 --> 3:57:05.280]  All they had to do was find out their greatest fears, their greatest weaknesses, and if it
[3:57:05.280 --> 3:57:09.520]  was sexual stuff, give them whatever they want, they had a stable of hose, literally
[3:57:09.520 --> 3:57:15.200]  a stable of thoughts, stable of hose, ready to go to work to do whatever they were told
[3:57:15.200 --> 3:57:17.560]  and they would do it for like no money at all.
[3:57:17.560 --> 3:57:19.480]  And basically anyone could be compromised.
[3:57:19.480 --> 3:57:26.240]  And so what they learned from this was how to recruit psychopaths and deviants to run
[3:57:26.240 --> 3:57:30.560]  the system or to be the tools of the system for total control.
[3:57:30.560 --> 3:57:36.960]  So again, total psychos, deviant serial killers, in-culture doctors, that's who runs the system.
[3:57:36.960 --> 3:57:40.120]  This is public information, it's not a conspiracy theory.
[3:57:40.120 --> 3:57:44.000]  This is all academic research that I'm looking at here.
[3:57:44.000 --> 3:57:45.360]  This is J. Dyer, Jason Ellison.
[3:57:45.360 --> 3:57:49.640]  Be sure to subscribe to my public stuff, my socials, and support Alex Jones.
[3:57:49.640 --> 3:57:53.880]  It's hard to believe we're already halfway into this insane year of 2021.
[3:57:53.880 --> 3:57:58.480]  We're seeing world government, world IDs being announced, forced inoculations, all the tyranny
[3:57:58.480 --> 3:58:03.240]  warned of is down here, but on the good side, there is also a global awakening, the lives
[3:58:03.240 --> 3:58:05.080]  of which this planet has never seen.
[3:58:05.080 --> 3:58:08.840]  So truly, the battle between good and evil is now front and center.
[3:58:08.840 --> 3:58:11.800]  That's why I want to thank all the viewers and all the listeners for your support, for

[3:59:01.680 --> 3:59:07.200]  I am a granny and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in
[3:59:07.200 --> 3:59:12.880]  the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called, but
[3:59:12.880 --> 3:59:18.680]  since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous actually.
[3:59:18.680 --> 3:59:24.760]  People think I'm 55 years old and I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought,
[3:59:24.760 --> 3:59:28.560]  you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless
[3:59:28.560 --> 3:59:32.840]  situation, but when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but
[3:59:32.840 --> 3:59:38.240]  you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket,
[3:59:38.240 --> 3:59:44.200]  this is working, this is wonderful, you know, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore,
