[01:24.040 --> 01:29.240]  point is just a great job by everybody we have a very important radio broadcast
[01:29.240 --> 01:34.920]  lined up obviously for you today Paul Watson's joining us on the latest flu
[01:34.920 --> 01:40.720]  developments in an hour and a half he'll be joining us Webster Tarpley will be

[01:45.120 --> 01:49.240]  have the show prepared in front of me with just extremely important news and
[01:49.240 --> 01:55.400]  information but right now it's hard to focus even in on the release of fall of
[01:55.400 --> 02:02.200]  the Republic and all this news I want to cover because my great uncle the last
[02:02.200 --> 02:08.760]  living son of Mamma Jones guess her name was Clara Jones everybody called her
[02:08.760 --> 02:16.080]  Mamma she lived to be 103 she had five sons as four of them went to World War
[02:16.080 --> 02:22.560]  2 then the baby was Leonard Jones he was he was the last of five and she had
[02:22.560 --> 02:28.680]  many years after she had her other sons and he was in Korea and most of those
[02:28.680 --> 02:37.480]  men died pretty young my my dad's father died when my father was about 30 when I
[02:37.480 --> 02:44.440]  was five years old and so Leonard was Leonard Jones was a father figure to my
[02:44.440 --> 02:50.280]  dad and to his brother Joe Lynn Jones and was just a really smart intelligent
[02:50.280 --> 02:57.840]  very very good person very strong person very loving person he was just a
[02:57.840 --> 03:04.960]  wonderful guy and he looked more Native American than some of his brothers my
[03:04.960 --> 03:08.920]  grandfather Jerry Jones looked extremely extremely Native American very handsome
[03:08.920 --> 03:13.920]  men and as they got older they really you know look like look like the classic
[03:13.920 --> 03:19.800]  Native American stoic handsome rugged face but even more interesting with those
[03:19.800 --> 03:28.400]  blue eyes staring out of that Indian face but he died yesterday afternoon and my
[03:28.400 --> 03:32.920]  dad didn't call me until this morning to let me don't know he died at about 5 30
[03:32.920 --> 03:36.080]  might have learned later in the evening he'd been down in Houston quite a bit
[03:36.080 --> 03:41.480]  visiting with him and the reason I talk about this is well it's it's it's
[03:41.480 --> 03:47.320]  multifaceted I've been so busy finishing fall the Republic and committed to that
[03:47.320 --> 03:52.120]  and then also finishing up Jesse Ventura's TV show that I had been meaning
[03:52.120 --> 03:59.200]  to go down to Houston and seem you know the doctor said he might live or he might
[03:59.200 --> 04:03.800]  live another six months he'd supposedly beaten pancreatic cancer a year ago but
[04:03.800 --> 04:07.960]  the process had really torn him up the chemotherapy the radiation the rest of
[04:07.960 --> 04:14.200]  it but you know it shows that what what what I put into fall the Republic and
[04:14.200 --> 04:19.000]  then I didn't even get to see him before he died but about nine months ago he was
[04:19.000 --> 04:23.320]  in Austin we had him over for Mexican food I went and picked up Motties and he
[04:23.320 --> 04:26.280]  said this is the first time I've been able to really eat a lot in months and
[04:26.280 --> 04:30.400]  gave him some red wine and he ate some beef and chicken fajitas and so it was
[04:30.400 --> 04:35.560]  the best he'd ever had Motties does have the best best fajitas I've tasted but
[04:35.560 --> 04:40.640]  but that's another issue I had a waking dream last night that I talked to the
[04:40.640 --> 04:43.680]  guys here in the office of whether or not I should share it with people and
[04:43.680 --> 04:47.440]  they said absolutely everybody's had those experiences and I and I think
[04:47.440 --> 04:53.360]  that's the reason I had a dream about his death last night so for all of you
[04:53.360 --> 04:57.240]  out there that don't believe in something after death you're very very
[04:57.240 --> 05:02.560]  foolish and I don't know what planet you're living on hundreds of nations

[08:51.080 --> 08:54.440]  make every nation on earth dependent to them how they were going to bring in a
[08:54.440 --> 08:58.360]  world government that would finance itself through money transferred taxes
[08:58.360 --> 09:02.640]  like the Tobin tax and of course the global carbon tax meant to regulate and
[09:02.640 --> 09:10.320]  micromanage every facet of our lives under a web of bureaucratic red tape my
[09:10.320 --> 09:16.080]  friends they're now openly announcing world government and it's exactly what
[09:16.080 --> 09:21.120]  was in all their battle plans years ago but it's even worse this is a 21st
[09:21.120 --> 09:28.040]  century nightmare they're about to ratify the Copenhagen global tax on all
[09:28.040 --> 09:32.760]  forms of industry and human activity planet-wide they're openly admitting
[09:32.760 --> 09:39.000]  it's a world government that is one of the key subjects that we cover in fall
[09:39.000 --> 09:43.000]  the Republic in their own words their own documents their own video statements
[09:43.000 --> 09:48.400]  and we have the solutions to counter these people and bring them to justice
[09:48.400 --> 09:53.160]  we also identify the banking cartel that empowers this entire global Ponzi
[09:53.160 --> 09:59.480]  scheme that's all the new world order is is a group of made-off slash can lay
[09:59.480 --> 10:03.920]  types that have gotten control of the issuance of currency and credit and have
[10:03.920 --> 10:09.760]  created tens of trillions of dollars backed up by taxpayers that they're
[10:09.760 --> 10:14.960]  able to pay off and buy off the entire planet with they've stolen tens of
[10:14.960 --> 10:18.840]  trillions of dollars they won't say where it's gone either we identify these
[10:18.840 --> 10:23.320]  criminals wake the population up to them and bring them to justice through the
[10:23.320 --> 10:27.600]  grand juries with criminal charges has congressman Ron Paul and others have
[10:27.600 --> 10:32.000]  called for they've clearly committed crimes insider trading conflicts of
[10:32.000 --> 10:35.240]  interest with Treasury Department officials and the private fellow
[10:35.240 --> 10:39.360]  reserve it's all in a fall of the Republic the experts we've gotten this
[10:39.360 --> 10:47.120]  film G Edward Griffin economist Webster Tarpley Max Kaiser so many others go to
[10:47.120 --> 10:53.200]  info wars.com read the rundown the film George Humphrey the list goes on and on
[10:53.200 --> 10:59.120]  and on Alan Watt myself and many others but most importantly the statements of
[10:59.120 --> 11:05.120]  the globalist themselves my friends the Obama deception has been out for over
[11:05.120 --> 11:10.600]  six months it is still the number one film online the number one documentary
[11:10.600 --> 11:14.360]  online on Google and YouTube and all the other major video channels and that
[11:14.360 --> 11:18.000]  happened because of you more and more when I do syndicated radio interviews
[11:18.000 --> 11:21.600]  other people shows whether they're supposed liberals or right-wingers
[11:21.600 --> 11:25.120]  they've shattered the left-right paradigm and they're recognizing that info wars
[11:25.120 --> 11:30.560]  calm and my films and the work we do is more and more setting the agenda setting
[11:30.560 --> 11:35.920]  the debate that stories we cover first are being forced into the mainstream and
[11:35.920 --> 11:41.080]  the establishment in a whole bunch of hit pieces in salon the new republic and
[11:41.080 --> 11:46.680]  many others psychology today have singled me out and said that I'm this great
[11:46.680 --> 11:50.160]  threat to their new world order they have admitted that we're having an effect
[11:50.160 --> 11:55.560]  they've admitted that we're actually affecting change and making people focus
[11:55.560 --> 11:59.720]  in on real issues not the left-right puppets that they put up in front of
[11:59.720 --> 12:06.760]  us to distract us but all the credit for that goes to you my radio audience is
[12:06.760 --> 12:11.480]  the most responsive the most active wonderful activists who are standing up
[12:11.480 --> 12:15.480]  against the new world order standing up against collectivism standing up against
[12:15.480 --> 12:19.880]  corruption and you are concerning the establishment congress has had different
[12:19.880 --> 12:24.080]  commissions that have issued reports saying that they are extremely threatened
[12:24.080 --> 12:28.400]  by the alternative media in the United States and worldwide and make no mistake
[12:28.400 --> 12:34.240]  my documentary films my radio show our news websites and you our secret weapon
[12:34.240 --> 12:40.280]  our listeners are at the tip of the spear of the alternative media ladies and
[12:40.280 --> 12:44.040]  gentlemen you made the Obama deception in endgame and terror storm massive
[12:44.040 --> 12:49.160]  successes each time we reach more people we are frightening the establishment
[12:49.160 --> 12:53.360]  they have identified us as enemies they have identified that we're endangering
[12:53.360 --> 12:57.320]  their entire program they know that we have a fighting chance to beat them this
[12:57.320 --> 13:03.360]  will succeed if you unleash yourself and take action show fall the republic to
[13:03.360 --> 13:07.600]  your friends your family your neighbors give it to your entire community it is
[13:07.600 --> 13:15.000]  up to you because in the final equation we are at the crossroads as a society
[13:15.000 --> 13:20.520]  right now there's no longer any doubt we were right it is world government it is
[13:20.520 --> 13:25.520]  a global carbon tax it is tyranny it will micromanage every facet of our
[13:25.520 --> 13:30.720]  lives but the good news is the establishment is failing on many fronts
[13:30.720 --> 13:35.880]  but where they're succeeding they're doing it by the thinnest of margins and
[13:35.880 --> 13:40.200]  enraging the world population when they go against the will of the people and
[13:40.200 --> 13:45.040]  when they go against justice and so we can certainly affect change right now
[13:45.040 --> 13:49.280]  because the establishment is stumbling and falling and faltering but they are
[13:49.280 --> 13:53.880]  still an extremely powerful and dangerous foe because they control the
[13:53.880 --> 13:57.520]  mainstream corporate media and they control the purse strings with the
[13:57.520 --> 14:03.200]  endless trillions they can issue a fiat liquidity and loans into the market
[14:03.200 --> 14:09.440]  fall of the republic details it all it is a quantum leap from previous films I
[14:09.440 --> 14:16.200]  have made and I am so proud of the work myself and my team have put together in
[14:16.200 --> 14:21.720]  this film and I'm asking you to be part of saving our republic we are at that
[14:21.720 --> 14:26.240]  crossroads but the enemy has shown themselves they have admitted that they
[14:26.240 --> 14:30.080]  want a planetary government run by a private bank they have admitted they're
[14:30.080 --> 14:34.080]  setting up domestic spy forces they have admitted that homeland security and
[14:34.080 --> 14:38.680]  north com are for the American people to suppress libertarians conservatives
[14:38.680 --> 14:44.840]  liberals anti-war activists anyone who stands against their tyranny they have
[14:44.840 --> 14:51.200]  shown themselves as the tyrants and the traders and the larcenist criminals that
[14:51.200 --> 14:56.920]  they are fall republic identifies the enemies of our nation and the enemies
[14:56.920 --> 15:02.320]  of free humanity worldwide that's the first step and it gives you the solutions

[15:08.480 --> 15:12.520]  realize that you must stand up at this critical juncture in history and get
[15:12.520 --> 15:19.440]  involved and speak out and spread the Obama deception in game terror storm all

[18:04.120 --> 18:10.040]  touch all of you out there because almost anyone I talked to has had similar
[18:10.040 --> 18:15.720]  experiences you really have to wonder about people who say that they haven't
[18:15.720 --> 18:20.600]  because for all of us that have had these experiences we know how real they are
[18:20.600 --> 18:26.760]  and we've had a glimpse through to the other side to another dimension
[18:26.760 --> 18:31.960]  and so I will discuss that when we come back from break
[18:31.960 --> 18:37.160]  also roll call one of the big washington papers
[18:37.160 --> 18:42.680]  the main paper of congress reports that alexander
[18:42.680 --> 18:47.080]  to white house don't create enemies list top senate republican took to the
[18:47.080 --> 18:52.040]  senate floor to suggest that a
[18:52.040 --> 18:56.200]  obama white house is plotting a political strategy similar to that of
[18:56.200 --> 18:58.760]  ex-president richard nixon and maybe on the verge of
[18:58.760 --> 19:04.760]  preparing its own enemies list this wasn't just in
[19:04.760 --> 19:09.160]  the big tabloid a few weeks ago listing myself alex Jones as one of the top
[19:09.160 --> 19:13.240]  enemies obama's secret enemies list revealed 25 names who president wants
[19:13.240 --> 19:17.160]  to silence and why there have been mainstream reports admitting obama
[19:17.160 --> 19:21.080]  does have an enemy's list and is going after people but i don't need to read
[19:21.080 --> 19:25.160]  this in the newspaper to know there's an enemy's list
[19:25.160 --> 19:29.960]  in the last four months or so there have been concerted attacks
[19:29.960 --> 19:34.920]  on myself we've always been under attack but this is concerted and focused
[19:34.920 --> 19:41.240]  and i'm not complaining or whining that this is what i asked for
[19:41.240 --> 19:44.120]  and i know that stepping up against these people they're going to engage us
[19:44.120 --> 19:48.120]  they're going to respond but it's just more of a confirmation the type of
[19:48.120 --> 19:52.200]  serious tyranny we're facing as a society and just how criminal

[24:28.680 --> 24:37.640]  deadlines and commitments what to leave in what to leave out
[24:37.640 --> 24:42.200]  against the wind what is it to be human we were running
[24:42.200 --> 24:50.520]  what is it to live on this planet spinning through the deepness of eternity
[24:50.520 --> 24:53.720]  and space and time
[24:54.600 --> 24:59.880]  we've all had experiences where we're walking along in the woods
[24:59.880 --> 25:03.400]  in a national park or on your own property
[25:03.400 --> 25:08.280]  and you feel someone's eyes upon you you turn towards the direction they're
[25:08.280 --> 25:12.760]  looking at you from you walk through the woods a hundred yards
[25:12.760 --> 25:19.320]  and you look up in a deer stand in the spring
[25:19.320 --> 25:26.040]  and someone is hunting out of season across the fence line
[25:26.040 --> 25:30.360]  on their own property you wave at them and continue walking on through the
[25:30.360 --> 25:34.760]  woods that happened once when i was squirrel
[25:34.760 --> 25:40.920]  hunting but it's happened in different ways to everybody
[25:40.920 --> 25:42.920]  out there at least everybody i've ever talked to
[25:42.920 --> 25:49.480]  what is that there are confirmed university reports
[25:49.480 --> 25:53.800]  especially out of australia where they've studied in the last 40 years or so
[25:53.800 --> 25:58.600]  in the studies i've seen where they'll have an opal mine or a diamond mine
[25:58.600 --> 26:03.320]  in australia and one of the aborigines will walk out of
[26:03.320 --> 26:06.840]  the mine and say you got to put me on a plane
[26:06.840 --> 26:12.200]  gonna put me on a helicopter my mother just died or my father's dying
[26:12.200 --> 26:16.920]  and they're never wrong they'll come out of the mine and say
[26:16.920 --> 26:21.320]  my brother just got hurt really bad they put him on the plane
[26:21.320 --> 26:25.000]  they fly him a thousand miles away and it's
[26:25.000 --> 26:29.720]  never a false alarm they know when one of those aborigines
[26:29.720 --> 26:35.000]  walks out of the mine very hard workers
[26:35.160 --> 26:39.880]  and says i've got to go that they got to go
[26:39.880 --> 26:43.400]  and they don't get in trouble for it
[26:45.240 --> 26:48.760]  i've had waking dreams many times in my life
[26:48.760 --> 26:51.720]  i have them a few times a year and they're different you know they're
[26:51.720 --> 26:55.160]  important you know as if you've been somewhere else
[26:55.160 --> 27:01.960]  you you you are braced you are shocked by it and one time i had a dream
[27:01.960 --> 27:06.040]  that i even told people about where i walked around this cinder block building
[27:06.040 --> 27:10.680]  and someone in a pink and green and purple striped polo shirt
[27:10.680 --> 27:16.840]  began assaulting me months later as i walked around a cinder block building
[27:16.840 --> 27:21.560]  i had a sick feeling of deja vu and there was the person in the
[27:21.560 --> 27:25.640]  polo shirt and they assaulted me
[27:31.160 --> 27:34.360]  i will tell you that i didn't just see the news and the reports and the
[27:34.360 --> 27:38.280]  preparation similar things i'll just share this with you
[27:38.280 --> 27:41.320]  happened before 9-11
[27:41.800 --> 27:44.600]  to the point of i said they're going to probably blow up the world trade
[27:44.600 --> 27:47.960]  centers and blame it on bin laden
[27:47.960 --> 27:51.960]  and it is a side of me that i don't really
[27:51.960 --> 27:55.800]  share on air because i know that detractors
[27:55.800 --> 27:59.480]  will try to spin it against me but i really don't care at this point
[27:59.480 --> 28:04.520]  the truth is the truth and the point is anyone who's in tune
[28:04.520 --> 28:10.440]  with the universe the spirit of the universe that
[28:10.440 --> 28:19.400]  einstein talked about how justice bends towards is attracted
[28:19.400 --> 28:23.320]  the universe bends towards justice
[28:24.680 --> 28:32.040]  and i remember my father's mother my grandmother patty jones
[28:32.680 --> 28:38.280]  she had been sick for several years but was getting up and walking around and
[28:38.280 --> 28:41.960]  was fine and no one expected her to die
[28:41.960 --> 28:47.880]  and i called my dad one night i guess this is about five and a half years
[28:47.880 --> 28:51.880]  ago now how time moves quickly how it flies
[28:51.880 --> 28:56.040]  and i said we've got to go see me ma that's what i called her
[28:56.040 --> 29:01.400]  we've got to go see her tomorrow and i hadn't seen her in months
[29:01.480 --> 29:04.280]  i said i've just really got a feeling we've got to go see her and i said is

[31:28.600 --> 31:33.000]  the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty

[33:28.120 --> 33:57.000]  what i'm discussing today deals with the very
[33:57.000 --> 34:05.320]  nature of reality and our limited five senses and that sixth sense
[34:08.200 --> 34:16.760]  and the proofs of the fact that there is more in this universe than meets the eye
[34:16.760 --> 34:21.080]  or the taste or the touch or what we hear or even feel
[34:21.080 --> 34:30.360]  so linard jones the youngest of five brothers to my
[34:30.360 --> 34:34.600]  father's great grandmother mamma jones as she was known

[34:42.200 --> 34:47.160]  world war two veterans died before she died and she said the only
[34:47.160 --> 34:50.920]  thing she regretted in her wonderful life i remember talking to her when i
[34:50.920 --> 34:56.280]  was little bitty was that she had outlived four of her five
[34:56.280 --> 35:00.440]  sons but she did die before her fifth son linard
[35:00.440 --> 35:07.560]  jones passed and he himself was a veteran of korea
[35:07.560 --> 35:15.400]  and a oh he'd worked his way up from a rough neck in the oil fields to a plant
[35:15.400 --> 35:18.680]  manager one of the biggest in houston just a great guy i remember
[35:18.680 --> 35:22.600]  deer hunting with him from the time i was five years old
[35:22.600 --> 35:26.600]  and he really was the last of that generation for my father
[35:26.600 --> 35:32.120]  david jones and his brother joe jones and i know that my father just loved him
[35:32.120 --> 35:36.360]  limitlessly but my dad's it worked today though he's very sad i talked to him
[35:36.360 --> 35:39.640]  this morning and i i'm talking about a death in our
[35:39.640 --> 35:44.840]  family because this affects everyone when you lose someone it affects
[35:44.840 --> 35:49.160]  all of us we're all interconnected
[35:49.160 --> 35:53.400]  but the issue is he died at about 5 30 yesterday my dad learned later in the
[35:53.400 --> 35:58.120]  evening and and didn't call me until this morning
[35:58.920 --> 36:02.520]  and i had one of those waking dreams last night but this one was different
[36:02.520 --> 36:06.200]  than one i'd ever had but i woke up in the middle of the night upset
[36:06.200 --> 36:12.760]  by it knowing that it was an omen or that it foretold something
[36:12.760 --> 36:17.160]  and i had trouble going back to sleep i got up and walked around the house some
[36:17.160 --> 36:20.760]  went in and looked at my children in their beds
[36:20.760 --> 36:24.840]  got a glass of water went back to bed and then had another
[36:24.840 --> 36:34.200]  waking dream that made no sense
[36:34.680 --> 36:38.040]  until i woke up this morning and found out that my uncle had died
[36:38.040 --> 36:44.200]  here's the first dream i'm looking into a science fiction
[36:44.200 --> 36:48.120]  nasc white walled
[36:51.240 --> 36:57.320]  cylindrical room and through a crack
[36:57.800 --> 37:00.760]  in the ceiling
[37:00.760 --> 37:07.720]  a arm first fingers and arms slide through and it chilled me to my
[37:07.720 --> 37:13.320]  bone it was destiny it was a bridge it was
[37:13.320 --> 37:17.560]  a road a path we're all on that we will all experience it is the great
[37:17.560 --> 37:23.960]  equalizer of kings and poppers of warriors and
[37:23.960 --> 37:28.760]  priests of mothers and fathers and everyone that
[37:28.760 --> 37:32.840]  has ever lived and everyone that has ever died
[37:32.840 --> 37:37.160]  i knew that arm as it appeared coming down out of the ceiling
[37:37.160 --> 37:42.200]  for what it was the arm of death the grim reaper
[37:42.920 --> 37:47.560]  and it chills me to my bone right now to see that arm it wasn't muscular but it
[37:47.560 --> 37:51.960]  had a mint strength it was slender its fingers were
[37:51.960 --> 37:58.840]  long and suddenly in the side of the wall appeared a type of
[37:58.840 --> 38:03.880]  vault or safe door and the fingers began to work
[38:03.880 --> 38:07.480]  numbers that appeared on its face in a hieroglyphic symbol
[38:07.480 --> 38:11.720]  and the door opened and it reached in and then suddenly i was looking out
[38:11.720 --> 38:18.280]  a doorway into space and an old man with gray hair was
[38:18.280 --> 38:25.800]  stepping through the gate and i awoke i had been to a place
[38:25.800 --> 38:33.560]  far away i had stared in to another dimension
[38:34.600 --> 38:38.440]  i got up shook myself
[38:40.120 --> 38:44.360]  went back to sleep and then i was transported to a
[38:44.360 --> 38:50.520]  warm dark house on my family's one of my family's ancestral
[38:50.520 --> 38:55.240]  home places in east texas and it was dark
[38:55.240 --> 38:59.800]  and there were men in the room
[39:03.720 --> 39:07.320]  and my father's brother and i need to call him
[39:07.320 --> 39:10.280]  and if anybody's hearing this now that knows him don't tell him about this
[39:10.280 --> 39:12.200]  until i've talked to him i need to call him today
[39:12.200 --> 39:16.040]  because i am assured that he was there and that he had this dream i haven't
[39:16.040 --> 39:18.760]  called him yet i only decided to talk about this right
[39:18.760 --> 39:21.480]  before i went on air and there were other men and i could
[39:21.480 --> 39:27.720]  tell they were family living people and he was saying it's okay
[39:27.720 --> 39:33.960]  i saw the same thing you saw and he's in a better place now
[39:33.960 --> 39:39.240]  and then his son was there saying is it okay
[39:39.240 --> 39:42.440]  my cousin was there i guess he's about
[39:42.440 --> 39:46.920]  12 years old 11 years old i forget now james was there
[39:46.920 --> 39:50.200]  and he was saying to his dad is it okay and and my uncle
[39:50.200 --> 39:53.400]  was almost childlike
[39:54.680 --> 39:59.320]  babbling happily saying yes yes it's okay
[40:03.320 --> 40:08.440]  and i go back to calling my father on a friday night
[40:08.440 --> 40:11.240]  and saying we've got to go see my grandmother tomorrow we've got to go
[40:11.240 --> 40:13.160]  see her we've got to go see her i haven't been
[40:13.160 --> 40:15.960]  there in months i want to go see her is she okay
[40:15.960 --> 40:19.480]  is she taking a turn for the worse and he said no she's fine
[40:19.480 --> 40:24.520]  and then that next morning she took a on that saturday morning a really bad
[40:24.520 --> 40:30.360]  turn she was in the bed and the local baptist pastor who
[40:30.360 --> 40:34.520]  down the street that my dad went to high school with
[40:34.520 --> 40:38.760]  he wasn't even from her church the methodist church in town
[40:38.760 --> 40:43.240]  the little country church he came down and he he told her it's okay patty you
[40:43.240 --> 40:46.360]  can turn loose again you know how women especially
[40:46.360 --> 40:51.160]  wait to die till their loved ones are there it's okay you can turn loose and
[40:51.160 --> 40:54.360]  then she she died
[40:55.960 --> 40:59.640]  and she she wasn't even really struggling he just said you can turn loose and she
[40:59.640 --> 41:04.440]  said okay took a deep breath and died gave up the ghost
[41:04.440 --> 41:08.040]  it's amazing how human beings in many cases can control
[41:08.040 --> 41:12.280]  when they die they can hold on it's the spirit
[41:12.280 --> 41:17.720]  and so as i said my father showed up my house at seven thirty
[41:21.240 --> 41:24.520]  my wife came in tried to get me up i'd gone ahead and done some radio
[41:24.520 --> 41:27.560]  interview till two three in the morning
[41:27.560 --> 41:31.880]  i smelled coffee downstairs she said your dad's here and i just said oh tell him
[41:31.880 --> 41:34.440]  to wait tell me he waited like 30 minutes i wouldn't get up
[41:34.440 --> 41:37.640]  back then i was wasn't as disciplined as i am now
[41:37.640 --> 41:40.760]  five years ago now i've just trained myself to get up but i wanted to sleep
[41:40.760 --> 41:44.040]  some more because i've been up till late at night
[41:44.040 --> 41:47.480]  and then when i got up she said oh he left he said get in your car and follow
[41:47.480 --> 41:50.840]  him so i got in my car and i'd gotten to about
[41:50.840 --> 41:55.560]  round rock where you're ready to make the turn to drive to
[41:55.560 --> 42:00.040]  where my family's from in east texas on my dad's side and my cell phone rang and
[42:00.040 --> 42:04.200]  he was about 30 minutes away by then from there
[42:04.200 --> 42:07.880]  he was about an hour and a half ahead of me two hours ahead of me
[42:07.880 --> 42:14.120]  and he said she she she just died she just died
[42:16.120 --> 42:20.360]  so there's that other experience and i knew in the last few weeks
[42:20.360 --> 42:24.280]  i was so busy with the film so busy having to if ventura had a call and said
[42:24.280 --> 42:27.080]  we need you to come do one more shoot i was planning to go then
[42:27.080 --> 42:30.200]  that weekend but then i got behind i wanted to see my children i was like
[42:30.200 --> 42:33.560]  well how is uncle Leonard well you know who knows he may live another year he
[42:33.560 --> 42:36.600]  may live a month but he doesn't want to take any more medications or see the
[42:36.600 --> 42:40.040]  doctors he doesn't even watch tv now he just sits there and basically
[42:40.040 --> 42:43.640]  meditates on life and says he's ready to go and he you know he
[42:43.640 --> 42:47.240]  wish it was otherwise but he is but you you you've got time we're planning to
[42:47.240 --> 42:50.440]  go down there next week i was gonna take off
[42:50.440 --> 42:53.880]  thursday and friday and take my children because my son
[42:53.880 --> 42:57.880]  has met uncle Leonard quite a bit and and loves him and particularly wanted to
[42:57.880 --> 43:01.960]  see him and was very upset wanting to see him in the last couple weeks
[43:01.960 --> 43:04.680]  my son isn't that type he is into hysterics he was saying i really want
[43:04.680 --> 43:08.120]  to go see uncle Leonard i want to go see uncle Leonard before he dies
[43:08.120 --> 43:16.120]  my son doesn't really know yet we didn't tell him this morning
[43:16.520 --> 43:18.920]  and
[43:18.920 --> 43:24.440]  you better talk to people you love you better let them know you love them you
[43:24.440 --> 43:27.240]  if you've got a feeling you need to see somebody or you need to warn somebody
[43:27.240 --> 43:30.040]  or you need to spend time with somebody you better just drop what you're doing
[43:30.040 --> 43:34.680]  and do it i should have left that friday night and gone to see my grandmother
[43:34.680 --> 43:37.720]  and been there when she died
[43:38.280 --> 43:41.800]  i was there when my grandfather died it was a very important experience in my
[43:41.800 --> 43:45.400]  life spiritually and i was there when one of my
[43:45.400 --> 43:49.960]  friends died a few years ago went into the hospital for a minor
[43:49.960 --> 43:52.680]  procedure got an infection and it killed him two days later
[43:52.680 --> 43:56.280]  total organ failure and you'd think that you wouldn't want to be around when
[43:56.280 --> 43:58.600]  somebody dies the establishment wants us to just
[43:58.600 --> 44:03.000]  shelve old people shelve sick people ignore it like you're throwing a happy
[44:03.000 --> 44:06.520]  meal bag in the trash in this instant gratification
[44:06.520 --> 44:10.280]  society but it's important that you be there if you
[44:10.280 --> 44:16.680]  can when people pass over to the other side and the larger issue obviously in
[44:16.680 --> 44:22.520]  all of this is there is more to the universe than meets the eye
[44:22.520 --> 44:26.920]  and daryl run this we've had on the air who's a lay pastor he's made the point
[44:26.920 --> 44:29.880]  and the analogy to people that will sell their soul
[44:29.880 --> 44:35.000]  for wealth and power and status who will ignore their conscience who will
[44:35.000 --> 44:38.600]  harden their heart who will commit to evil
[44:38.600 --> 44:42.040]  who will commit to selfishness
[44:42.680 --> 44:47.880]  and none of us are perfect but it's the act of not caring that's the real sin
[44:47.880 --> 44:52.440]  king david had one of his best friends killed
[44:52.440 --> 44:55.960]  sent him off on a mission he knew he was sure to die just so he could have his
[44:55.960 --> 44:59.800]  woman but he repented and so god said you are a man
[44:59.800 --> 45:05.800]  after my own heart the issue here is is what your heart
[45:05.800 --> 45:12.200]  has written on it
[45:15.560 --> 45:19.880]  but there are so many individuals out there who believe this is all there is
[45:19.880 --> 45:23.720]  in the world do as thou will feed on people hurt people it's all
[45:23.720 --> 45:27.080]  about raw power hurt the innocent dumb people down
[45:27.080 --> 45:33.720]  use knowledge you have that others don't have against them in a bad way
[45:33.720 --> 45:37.240]  and they will laugh at you and say there is no god there is nothing else
[45:37.240 --> 45:41.240]  this life isn't a test we're just animals we're just protoplasm
[45:41.240 --> 45:44.920]  we're just a bunch of cells that's all this is
[45:44.920 --> 45:50.680]  and they've hardened their hearts against what's written on their soul
[45:51.640 --> 45:55.080]  and that's really the message here
[45:55.560 --> 45:58.760]  that i want to relay to people out there who have hardened their hearts
[45:58.760 --> 46:02.440]  and who haven't hardened them completely for those of you out there
[46:02.440 --> 46:07.000]  that isn't too late to turn back
[46:08.440 --> 46:13.480]  is that this life is a test
[46:14.920 --> 46:21.960]  this life is extremely short and what matters in life
[46:21.960 --> 46:26.920]  is the decisions you make to do the right thing and to be an honorable person
[46:26.920 --> 46:35.080]  and to help others and to strive to by degrees develop yourself
[46:37.960 --> 46:41.400]  into someone who is striving to be closer
[46:41.400 --> 46:46.920]  to the creator and everything that's good and all the blessings that flow from
[46:46.920 --> 46:49.960]  creation in life
[46:51.320 --> 46:56.440]  and it's very very sad to see people so caught up in the world so mesmerized by
[46:56.440 --> 46:59.720]  it so turned completely over to it
[46:59.720 --> 47:05.720]  that they are blinded to what really matters
[47:05.720 --> 47:08.840]  that's why i don't fear death that's why i don't fear
[47:08.840 --> 47:13.640]  the pain of death that's why i don't fear
[47:15.720 --> 47:18.840]  the loss of control
[47:19.720 --> 47:23.560]  because i understand it's all part of a process and what it is to be a human
[47:23.560 --> 47:28.120]  being and i say to those of you out there
[47:28.120 --> 47:31.240]  who have not had these experiences in life that
[47:31.240 --> 47:38.600]  give you a window into other worlds that you need to get your heart and mind and
[47:38.600 --> 47:44.600]  soul right with the universe and to ask god to open up your soul
[47:44.600 --> 47:49.880]  and to show you the wider plane of existence
[47:49.880 --> 47:56.920]  so that you can develop and so that you don't miss out on the true secrets
[47:56.920 --> 48:00.600]  the true mysteries of life
[48:00.760 --> 48:04.040]  now on the other side of that there's the blind and the people that are just
[48:04.040 --> 48:08.600]  turned over to petty evil there's also those on the true dark side that are
[48:08.600 --> 48:13.160]  fully aware of all of this and have made the conscious
[48:13.160 --> 48:16.040]  decision
[48:16.040 --> 48:23.560]  to understand these great truths and to use them against their fellow
[48:23.560 --> 48:30.520]  human beings for earthly and carnal power on this limited third
[48:30.520 --> 48:35.480]  dimensional plane that we exist on
[48:38.600 --> 48:42.760]  you know i think about colonel craig roberts and i and i tried last minute to
[48:42.760 --> 48:45.960]  get him on today but he's busy helping a neighbor take a tractor in to get a
[48:45.960 --> 48:49.960]  new tire put on it lives out in the countryside in
[48:49.960 --> 48:52.760]  oklahoma
[48:52.840 --> 48:57.800]  but the story he told about how he died on the operating table
[48:57.800 --> 49:01.800]  and i believe he said he was they quit trying to resuscitate him
[49:01.800 --> 49:05.160]  and he was dead completely dead for more than
[49:05.160 --> 49:08.520]  six minutes that they had walked away from the table
[49:08.520 --> 49:14.520]  and then he awoke and to be there and to describe what millions and millions of
[49:14.520 --> 49:18.120]  others have described to have this presence behind him this this angel
[49:18.120 --> 49:22.520]  that that had recorded his entire life to see his life flashed before his eyes
[49:22.520 --> 49:26.920]  and then to be taken up before two portals
[49:26.920 --> 49:31.000]  one portal they knew was a bad place one portal that he wanted to go to that
[49:31.000 --> 49:35.240]  was the most wonderful thing that he could have ever even possibly imagined
[49:35.240 --> 49:40.440]  and to literally then be downloaded with information
[49:40.440 --> 49:44.360]  and told you are being sent back to speak out against the new world order
[49:44.360 --> 49:49.800]  and that happened to him and that's happened to so many other people
[49:49.800 --> 49:54.760]  ladies and gentlemen these are true stories these these things happened
[49:54.760 --> 49:58.440]  i had a dream about the grim reaper i saw the grim reaper
[49:58.440 --> 50:03.480]  for the first time in my life i witnessed it last night
[50:03.480 --> 50:07.000]  and then i had a comforting dream
[50:08.040 --> 50:10.760]  after that
[50:10.760 --> 50:14.200]  and was there with others that experienced
[50:14.200 --> 50:17.560]  something similar i'm sure of it
[50:18.280 --> 50:22.440]  i didn't have time this morning or for some reason i i didn't ask my dad to be
[50:22.440 --> 50:26.440]  anything happened last night but the point is you've all experienced things
[50:26.440 --> 50:31.240]  that are similar you've all experienced it even
[50:31.240 --> 50:34.680]  those of you that have hardened your hearts if you think back i'm sure you
[50:34.680 --> 50:37.560]  have been given glimpses
[50:37.560 --> 50:45.640]  so understand that what you do today you will be judged for
[50:45.640 --> 50:49.400]  and understand this is all a great test
[50:49.880 --> 50:54.520]  and face that fact and realize there are more things in heaven and earth than in

[54:24.440 --> 54:27.160]  and when the band plays
[54:33.160 --> 54:37.400]  I had one more point I wanted to make I started to tell the story the parable that Daryl Rundus likes
[54:37.400 --> 54:45.480]  to tell and it's absolutely true what would it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his
[54:45.480 --> 54:51.800]  soul and when you tell someone given over to the world that they laugh at you they have a crazed
[54:51.800 --> 54:59.160]  look in their eye they've hardened their heart they covet their evil as if it's a possession
[55:00.040 --> 55:06.680]  as if it's some treat and I have been taken up on the mountain by the world I've been offered
[55:06.680 --> 55:12.360]  great things and that only confirms to me even more when the corporate worlds tried to buy me
[55:12.360 --> 55:19.160]  off in the past just how real this is now I'm on the white house enemies list and it's confirmed
[55:19.160 --> 55:25.160]  they have one mainstream news rogel call and ap and other publications we're going to cover that
[55:25.160 --> 55:36.440]  next hour but Daryl tells the parable of you go up to somebody and you say I'll give you a thousand
[55:36.440 --> 55:44.280]  dollars to surgically have your eyes removed and to give them to me they'll say no way
[55:44.280 --> 55:54.040]  okay I'll give you a 10,000 never I'll give you a million no I'll give you a billion no way buddy
[55:54.040 --> 56:02.120]  are you taking my eyes well the eyes are only the window to the soul in the embryonic phase of the
[56:02.120 --> 56:08.360]  baby developing the brain literally grows two stocks that come out and form in the face of the
[56:08.360 --> 56:16.440]  skull the eyes are brain tissue you look into someone's eyes you're looking into their mind
[56:20.280 --> 56:26.040]  the most important of the five senses that science records and documents
[56:28.280 --> 56:32.360]  well what would you give for your intellect what would you give for who you are what you are
[56:32.360 --> 56:38.200]  nothing well then why would you give your soul over to corruption and evil for petty
[56:38.200 --> 56:50.120]  power for sex for wealth for status and then you realize how foolish it is to sell out but
[56:50.120 --> 56:54.120]  see we sell out by degree and we've all done it one way or the other none of us are perfect
[56:56.600 --> 57:00.280]  but it's always possible unless you've completely given yourself over
[57:00.280 --> 57:06.280]  and committed so many crimes against the innocent that you're too far gone but it's almost always
[57:06.280 --> 57:13.640]  possible to turn back to turn back on the road the road to perdition
[57:16.280 --> 57:22.680]  and that's the choice we all make but by increments we see the media the culture the
[57:22.680 --> 57:28.680]  establishment selling us on violence death destruction torture secret arrest black uniforms
[57:28.680 --> 57:33.720]  all the trappings of classical evil we know how it manifests in a nation we know how it
[57:33.720 --> 57:40.120]  manifests in a culture we know what we're seeing we know what it is if you have a thimble of discernment
[57:40.120 --> 57:47.320]  or understanding you would see it but you are becoming spiritually blind because you're losing
[57:47.320 --> 57:55.000]  your sight you're losing your discernment if you can't see all of this around you
[57:55.000 --> 58:00.600]  you it's because from birth you were set down in front of the television and weren't taught any
[58:00.600 --> 58:09.000]  wisdom but it's not too late for you to turn back and i beg of thee out there many of you that

[1:02:10.200 --> 1:02:13.720]  remember a decade ago when they were developing this telling people it would be used to turn your

[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:17.640]  of course it is revelations we got an incredible situation on our hands as a society and as a world

[1:03:26.120 --> 1:03:32.520]  mean all the whorehouse fake new older churches and all the religionists and all their propaganda see
[1:03:32.520 --> 1:03:37.960]  the elite are all into the occult they they they believe in spiritual forces they they know all
[1:03:37.960 --> 1:03:43.720]  of this exists they want to blind you fully because the devil's biggest trick is convincing the world
[1:03:43.720 --> 1:03:48.760]  he doesn't exist and that's why a lot of people don't want to hear about this type of stuff because
[1:03:48.760 --> 1:03:55.400]  it stings their conscience it's painful to listen to and the world has put up all these fake bible
[1:03:55.400 --> 1:04:03.400]  fumpers and churchgoers and Pharisees and Sadducees and all the proud holier than now individuals
[1:04:05.960 --> 1:04:11.160]  to put a bad face on being a spiritual person and getting right with god
[1:04:13.160 --> 1:04:17.640]  it's all been done by design just like they demonize the patriot and liberty movement
[1:04:17.640 --> 1:04:24.680]  by focusing in on ne'er do wells or lunatics or more often than not government operatives who are
[1:04:24.680 --> 1:04:30.760]  there to discredit what we're doing i mean it it's simple tricks they play and once you're aware of
[1:04:30.760 --> 1:04:39.640]  the designs once you're aware of the snares the darts you can navigate through them but then you
[1:04:39.640 --> 1:04:48.920]  begin to fully turn yourself over to the compulsion to warn others about these systems so that they
[1:04:48.920 --> 1:04:56.360]  not be caught in them and it's very sad to watch people frothing and flailing and jerking through
[1:04:56.360 --> 1:05:02.360]  the system as they're attacked by the psych warfare operatives the illusion created by the power elite
[1:05:02.360 --> 1:05:07.720]  is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat will you continue to be their profit center

[1:09:59.320 --> 1:10:05.640]  using it without warrants to listen to people now through homeland security and threat fusion
[1:10:05.640 --> 1:10:12.040]  threat integration centers the first time i saw it mainstream news was 2003 it's in my film matrix
[1:10:12.040 --> 1:10:17.000]  of evil if you want to check it out the green bay newspaper had the governor who i guess spoke
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:24.840]  about something classified before he was supposed to giving a tour of a facility in the state of
[1:10:24.840 --> 1:10:30.280]  wisconsin and saying yes look in real time we can type in somebody's driver's license number
[1:10:30.280 --> 1:10:35.960]  social security number or cell phone number and it will pinpoint down to 15 feet where they are
[1:10:35.960 --> 1:10:41.000]  off of their cell phones so that's what's being integrated in these local centers are really
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:46.200]  federalization centers they're integrating the military the cia the fbi into them totally
[1:10:46.200 --> 1:10:52.040]  taking over your town here in austin they have admitted members of army's psychological warfare
[1:10:52.040 --> 1:10:58.120]  operations running the new carbon tax they're gonna have city carbon taxes run by pentagon
[1:10:58.120 --> 1:11:04.280]  operatives i mean it's just unspeakable grid of control because they knew they were going to
[1:11:04.280 --> 1:11:08.760]  implode the economy they knew they were going to bring in tyranny they had to deploy homeland
[1:11:08.760 --> 1:11:14.920]  security brigades regular army this is to suppress us and they're going to stage terror
[1:11:14.920 --> 1:11:19.320]  attacks against the military employment on the american people so the military will get past their
[1:11:20.840 --> 1:11:25.560]  their allergy or their resistance as the establishment sees it towards policing and
[1:11:25.560 --> 1:11:30.520]  pulling triggers on the american people and they're having urban warfare drills and then live action
[1:11:30.520 --> 1:11:36.520]  drills and then checkpoints for dwis oh aren't you for stopping drunk drivers with the marines
[1:11:36.520 --> 1:11:42.840]  in the army to acclimate to make it sound like it's good up front selling it to the public as if
[1:11:42.840 --> 1:11:49.560]  it's a wonderful thing and they have a million two hundred thousand plus americans as of
[1:11:51.400 --> 1:11:56.200]  eleven months ago they reported in january when they made the list secret the list is secret but
[1:11:56.200 --> 1:12:00.600]  the numbers on it are now secret that a million two hundred thousand people were on it and the
[1:12:00.600 --> 1:12:07.560]  twenty five thousand plus were being added a month and then a bunch of well one of the heads of the
[1:12:11.080 --> 1:12:17.560]  air police of the federal marshals air marshals went public in the denver post and said look we're
[1:12:17.560 --> 1:12:23.720]  ordered to put innocent people on this list for ordering vegetarian meals when they buy a ticket
[1:12:23.720 --> 1:12:29.400]  at the airport or for a five-year-old snapping a photo when they're inside the airplane we are
[1:12:29.400 --> 1:12:35.640]  ordered to put people every month on the list for life you can't get off of it to create the illusion
[1:12:35.640 --> 1:12:40.840]  of a terror threat so i wanted to add that little tidbit that it's innocent people then they announced
[1:12:40.840 --> 1:12:45.240]  as i told you they would do years ago i know their operations it's clear it's like having a jigsaw puzzle
[1:12:45.240 --> 1:12:52.520]  that there's a hundred pieces and 95 of them are in in place and you're looking to put the last five
[1:12:52.520 --> 1:13:01.640]  pieces in i mean it's as easy as kiss my hand to do it i mean it's as easy as chewing a stick of
[1:13:01.640 --> 1:13:08.920]  bubblegum i mean you can do it with your blindfolded you you know that's why everything i talk about
[1:13:08.920 --> 1:13:12.840]  comes true because i'm i'm just telling you all the other pieces i'm thinking of thousands right
[1:13:12.840 --> 1:13:18.120]  now you don't have time to go through them all and i know what's going on and they are saying that
[1:13:18.120 --> 1:13:22.920]  if you haven't paid all your taxes or you have bad credit you're not going to be able to fly and
[1:13:22.920 --> 1:13:25.720]  then you're not going to be able to get on buses you're not going to be able to go in shopping malls
[1:13:25.720 --> 1:13:29.160]  they're going to put metal detectors in shopping malls and set up checkpoints that was announced
[1:13:29.160 --> 1:13:35.480]  five years ago now they put out a new fake terror alert with some supposed al-qaeda person who wanted
[1:13:35.480 --> 1:13:44.120]  to attack shopping malls they you know it's all happening and they use on start to listen to you
[1:13:44.120 --> 1:13:51.320]  and i told you that many of the and i've seen this for the last close to a decade many of the
[1:13:51.320 --> 1:13:56.200]  bigger use car companies and now even the smaller ones right here in austin where i live and i first
[1:13:56.200 --> 1:14:03.720]  saw in los angeles in new york put a kill switch in your car until your car is paid off
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:10.760]  in the ignition only cost a few hundred bucks and they charge you for it to and if you try to
[1:14:10.760 --> 1:14:16.680]  remove it it it it's triggered to where your car won't start so until you've paid your car off
[1:14:17.240 --> 1:14:23.560]  that kill switch is in there but i've noticed talking to people that have had it they never go
[1:14:23.560 --> 1:14:28.040]  get it taken out and if they do they just say oh keep it we'd have to charge you to take it out
[1:14:28.680 --> 1:14:32.840]  the truth is they're getting a kickback from the company to leave it in and i remember seeing oh
[1:14:32.840 --> 1:14:39.560]  probably five years ago that in los angeles that's the real cia testing ground more than the other
[1:14:39.560 --> 1:14:45.480]  city new york and boston are starting to and dalis are starting to get almost as bad with cia funding
[1:14:45.480 --> 1:14:50.760]  that via helicopter or police cars they have special units that have kill switches where they
[1:14:50.760 --> 1:14:55.240]  aim it at your car the problem is it can kill other cars around it but they aim it at your car
[1:14:55.240 --> 1:15:01.320]  with a radio signal and it turns your car off but that's just in one system there's a whole
[1:15:01.320 --> 1:15:06.120]  bunch of these progressive will pay you to put a box in your car they don't tell you it can turn
[1:15:06.120 --> 1:15:10.920]  your car off they don't tell you that almost all new cars made in the last 12 years or so
[1:15:10.920 --> 1:15:20.120]  by federal law have well it was most cars six eight years ago now i remember it's all cars by law
[1:15:20.120 --> 1:15:24.920]  have a box in them that tracks how fast you're driving what really happened when you wrecked
[1:15:24.920 --> 1:15:29.560]  they then use that to charge you i mean total control grids are being built into everything
[1:15:29.560 --> 1:15:36.280]  computers iphones all cell phones cars and on top of that is the on star
[1:15:37.960 --> 1:15:41.880]  now this is us news and world report they're just now introducing it to the slaves
[1:15:45.480 --> 1:15:50.120]  and even if your on star was never activated they can still kill your car whether they can
[1:15:50.120 --> 1:15:55.480]  activate it instantly and notice how they phrase it as if it's wonderful how they package it and
[1:15:55.480 --> 1:16:00.760]  present it as if it's the best thing in the world that's how a Ponzi scheme works when some Ponzi
[1:16:00.760 --> 1:16:05.320]  scammer comes into the country club and gets one old lady to invest 10 grand with her the next week
[1:16:05.320 --> 1:16:11.480]  she gets 30 grand back at first it's good so that it looks good so everybody jumps on board oh look
[1:16:11.480 --> 1:16:17.080]  the marines are running checkpoints uh in new york and vermont and kentucky and in california
[1:16:17.080 --> 1:16:22.040]  stopping drunks oh look the army's out helping at car wrecks with the jaws of life you're not against
[1:16:22.040 --> 1:16:27.480]  the army helping that young girl might have died see how they phrase it look at how they're
[1:16:27.480 --> 1:16:33.720]  phrasing it here how they're how they're presenting it it's like a feed block or range cubes or a
[1:16:33.720 --> 1:16:40.840]  corn uh deer feeder yeah it's good the first 20 times the deer eat out of it until the day you're
[1:16:40.840 --> 1:16:48.600]  in the deer stand and shoot them that's how this works on star ends first police chase that little
[1:16:48.600 --> 1:16:53.800]  on star button on the rear view mirror of general motors car can do a lot of things this week the
[1:16:53.800 --> 1:17:01.480]  system was used to end a high speed chase for the first time the ap reports police in california
[1:17:01.480 --> 1:17:06.280]  say general motors on star communication systems stopped a dangerous high speed chase and helped
[1:17:06.280 --> 1:17:12.120]  them capture a carjacking suspect by disabling the stolen sport utility vehicle the Chevy Tahoe was
[1:17:12.120 --> 1:17:17.240]  stolen by a carjacker who used a sawed-off shotgun to threaten the driver into giving up the car so
[1:17:17.240 --> 1:17:22.040]  see it's a carjacker aren't you for it police conducted on star which found the Tahoe by using
[1:17:22.040 --> 1:17:27.080]  a global positioning system two officers spotted the suv but the driver sped off that's when on
[1:17:27.080 --> 1:17:33.800]  star operators sent a signal that slowed the Tahoe to a halt and it goes on to say they didn't have
[1:17:33.800 --> 1:17:39.640]  to pursue it quickly and endanger other drivers because they knew they could kill the car and
[1:17:39.640 --> 1:17:45.080]  they it that stopped a potentially dangerous high speed chase the thief was captured on foot kicking
[1:17:45.080 --> 1:17:50.840]  tire notes reports that last year three and 34 people were killed around the country and police
[1:17:50.840 --> 1:17:55.480]  pursuits according to national highway traffic safety administration then i have other reports

[1:18:19.080 --> 1:18:23.400]  they are stating that's what this is really for this is in everything they want to know what

[1:26:29.320 --> 1:26:33.800]  darkness but it's just going to get worse and worse until you're forced to make the decision to stand
[1:26:33.800 --> 1:26:43.240]  up in even more bold a fashion and i care about you and i've apologized for the way i've ranted
[1:26:43.240 --> 1:26:48.200]  and raved at a primitive level threatened by you because i know that only adds to the
[1:26:48.920 --> 1:26:53.720]  gang mentality of the us against them and divides us and that's what the system wants
[1:26:53.720 --> 1:26:57.800]  but i'm telling you right now this is pure evil we're dealing with and you better get

[1:28:26.440 --> 1:28:29.320]  precisely what we're dealing with it it's not a joke
[1:28:29.320 --> 1:28:42.920]  that's where this is going and heaven help us because we have an elite who openly
[1:28:42.920 --> 1:28:48.360]  write thousands of textbooks and documents and white papers how they're building a quote planetary
[1:28:48.360 --> 1:28:58.040]  regime a planetary dictatorship to condition and train the public to accept our orderly extermination
[1:28:58.040 --> 1:29:05.240]  and they're going to move incrementally and that's all this is it's very hard to fight something
[1:29:05.240 --> 1:29:13.480]  that's incremental and it's happening and we as a society and as a civilization have to make a
[1:29:13.480 --> 1:29:22.440]  decision on whether or not we're going to go along with all of this i saw a comment on a youtube video
[1:29:22.440 --> 1:29:28.920]  today the video we posted where i'm reaching out to people to promote fall the republic so we can

[1:33:16.440 --> 1:33:34.680]  the great and though the news was rather sad well i just had to laugh i saw the photograph
[1:33:38.440 --> 1:33:43.640]  okay i have a very important program note for everyone i'll just let the listeners know what's
[1:33:43.640 --> 1:33:47.080]  going on and what's happening here and we're going to go to your phone calls and paul watson's
[1:33:47.080 --> 1:33:56.120]  coming up in the next hour and then webster terribly in the final hour i have two big cdn so
[1:33:56.120 --> 1:34:01.080]  for people that don't know what those are it's where you put your web content your multimedia
[1:34:01.080 --> 1:34:06.040]  your websites on a system that has thousands of servers so you don't just have one server that's
[1:34:06.040 --> 1:34:10.680]  yours your content's put on a bunch of servers that's what google and youtube and all the big
[1:34:10.680 --> 1:34:17.800]  media sites use they have hundreds of cds we have two cds but that's not the problem our cds aren't
[1:34:17.800 --> 1:34:24.120]  having the problem our servers because you still have to have your own box especially if it's a
[1:34:24.120 --> 1:34:33.160]  dynamic site your own server to serve out the front page of prison planet dot tv and we have a
[1:34:33.160 --> 1:34:37.720]  lot of members at prison planet dot tv and i also have it turned up where you can share your passcode
[1:34:37.720 --> 1:34:45.640]  code with six people simultaneously that's not the problem but it is the problem because all
[1:34:45.640 --> 1:34:51.480]  those extra people that have the passcode are on the front page of prison planet dot tv hitting
[1:34:51.480 --> 1:35:03.000]  it over and over and over again hitting refresh they're on there and that's why i tend to launch
[1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:11.160]  films a day early so that we can test out the servers and i'm going to launch this at three p.m.
[1:35:11.160 --> 1:35:27.160]  today and whatever happens it will be served up to members it's just that there is a firestorm on
[1:35:27.160 --> 1:35:32.360]  the internet of people wanting to see the film in fact there are hundreds of times in the web
[1:35:32.360 --> 1:35:37.800]  traffic the number of people hitting prison planet dot tv than our members so most people
[1:35:37.800 --> 1:35:43.000]  going there aren't even members and can't even see it to begin with so uh we've got some worker
[1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:47.640]  rounds with this like pull up prison planet dot tv for me so i can just see it they say it's up and
[1:35:47.640 --> 1:35:53.320]  down i've got my two it guys in there trying to figure this out we've never had anything like this
[1:35:53.320 --> 1:35:59.640]  we didn't have any problem launching the obama deception and we haven't had trouble watching
[1:35:59.640 --> 1:36:06.040]  launching the other films we've got a pretty robust system but we may have to put
[1:36:07.480 --> 1:36:13.240]  look i'll tell the i t guys what the answer is in fact go ahead and call matt in here right now
[1:36:13.240 --> 1:36:17.320]  just want to talk to him on air tell him don't worry we're not on prison planet dot tv he doesn't
[1:36:17.320 --> 1:36:26.600]  want to be on tv just just call him in here and i'll tell him what i want done the and i'll see
[1:36:26.600 --> 1:36:30.280]  if this is an answer we'll work through this together on air i just have total transparency
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:36.440]  with what we do here in my office same thing happened with charlie sheen we tried to upload
[1:36:36.440 --> 1:36:43.000]  the report at eight a.m. that morning and the servers locked out and we three times first it
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:47.080]  uploaded just the first half of his 20 minutes with the president then it uploaded it without the
[1:36:47.080 --> 1:36:52.440]  links then it uploaded it without the image at the bottom of his signature you couldn't tell it
[1:36:52.440 --> 1:36:56.840]  was an image because it was a signature on white paper on a white website but that that ended
[1:36:56.840 --> 1:37:01.640]  up screwing up the signature and the disclaimer and now we're having the same problem because
[1:37:02.440 --> 1:37:03.560]  i can't afford
[1:37:07.560 --> 1:37:13.640]  i can't afford to have a super mega robust system because only two or three times a year
[1:37:13.640 --> 1:37:19.000]  do we have this type of traffic i already have a four hundred thousand dollar internet bandwidth
[1:37:19.000 --> 1:37:24.280]  slash it bill a year and that's cheap that's it's searching everywhere for the best and most
[1:37:24.280 --> 1:37:28.440]  intimate systems so i can't afford anything better for members i mean it's already a great system
[1:37:30.200 --> 1:37:34.440]  and it is barely paying for itself and i just you hear me on the air with the sponsors everything
[1:37:34.440 --> 1:37:39.800]  else trying to squeeze enough capital to fund this rebel operation against the new order most
[1:37:39.800 --> 1:37:45.640]  rebels in history robbed banks to fund themselves we don't do that and the co entelepro criticizes
[1:37:45.640 --> 1:37:49.400]  us for trying to raise the money to run this operation and we're and we're really victims of
[1:37:49.400 --> 1:37:59.560]  our own success but we will deliver this virally to everyone today
[1:38:01.720 --> 1:38:05.800]  matt let's walk through this together because i just had this idea we're talking in the break
[1:38:05.800 --> 1:38:16.600]  about solutions we don't have to make a new limited front page to get it can't we just pull off the
[1:38:16.600 --> 1:38:23.080]  members login page i believe that's already on its own server or at least i asked for it to be
[1:38:23.880 --> 1:38:27.960]  in the past i don't understand all this architecture but can't we just have a separate page
[1:38:28.680 --> 1:38:33.720]  just where people log in to watch it so even though prison planet dot tv the site goes down
[1:38:33.720 --> 1:38:39.880]  on info wars and prison planet for members i can post up on the front page at three o'clock the
[1:38:39.880 --> 1:38:44.920]  login for members and then they can get into the back end and watch it is that not the workaround
[1:38:44.920 --> 1:38:49.800]  yeah we can definitely provide a workaround where we can definitely get the the con the content out
[1:38:49.800 --> 1:38:56.840]  there and make sure that even if the main site has some is faulty but we can still deliver the quality
[1:38:56.840 --> 1:39:00.280]  product out there and that's what we need definitely need to be and then you were saying the other
[1:39:00.280 --> 1:39:06.440]  problem is it's so overwhelmed it's hard to get into it to make changes yeah we're this is what
[1:39:06.440 --> 1:39:10.440]  happened with sheen why don't you tell folks what happened that morning yeah everybody was hunting
[1:39:10.440 --> 1:39:16.040]  around looking for in the case of charlie sheen's document looking around for the for that document
[1:39:16.040 --> 1:39:19.640]  so we couldn't even get it uploaded and post it because they were on it correct there's so many
[1:39:19.640 --> 1:39:26.120]  people searching the site looking around for that extra additional traffic that was generated by all
[1:39:26.120 --> 1:39:31.320]  that was causing us not to be able to get into the back end and and upload it now now i had it
[1:39:31.320 --> 1:39:35.000]  people and you'd already said this email me and say well you just need to have your servers in
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:40.440]  house yeah that's easy of your serving uh you know pictures of your baseball team out to 10 people
[1:39:40.440 --> 1:39:45.160]  it's different to have servers in house because of the cost we have to go to the giant server
[1:39:45.160 --> 1:39:51.240]  centers where it's cheap in chicago in dallas in england in san francisco in silicon valley but we
[1:39:51.240 --> 1:39:58.520]  are getting the mega fiber optic pipe in the next two weeks can we but would that change this any
[1:39:58.520 --> 1:40:04.280]  it would add another um another point of distribution and it's all about making it
[1:40:04.280 --> 1:40:08.760]  decentralized because you never want to have a choke point and that's and that's and that fibers
[1:40:08.760 --> 1:40:14.200]  3000 a month right yeah well i mean tell folks about this is a mega pipe tell them what it is
[1:40:14.200 --> 1:40:22.520]  it's a fiber optic connection uh bandwidth is 65 megabits coming in that will allow us to push
[1:40:22.520 --> 1:40:29.480]  data out push out the new releases way quicker than we what currently are we can also start looking
[1:40:29.480 --> 1:40:36.520]  into uh some higher quality high super high definition streaming i mean yeah we've been
[1:40:36.520 --> 1:40:42.680]  studying it to go to actual high def yeah definitely on the stream uh live streaming and all that
[1:40:42.680 --> 1:40:48.360]  will allow us to get into that next phase where we can definitely get get the word out get it out
[1:40:48.360 --> 1:40:53.320]  there quickly and just to be clear we were a very small company still tiny when we moved out of our
[1:40:53.320 --> 1:40:57.480]  two two and a half thousand square foot rather we had two offices we moved into this eight thousand
[1:40:57.480 --> 1:41:02.120]  square foot we just expanded another seven thousand that i just leased the city's not giving us permits
[1:41:02.120 --> 1:41:05.960]  but we finally just went ahead and started without it because you you can do that except for the
[1:41:05.960 --> 1:41:10.600]  electrical the point is is that's what our growing pains have been we appreciate everybody's support
[1:41:10.600 --> 1:41:15.400]  just giving people kind of an inside view time warner said they'd give us time-warnered cable
[1:41:15.400 --> 1:41:21.880]  when we came in here then they wouldn't so we're going off dsl and t1 it's been hell uh but we're
[1:41:21.880 --> 1:41:25.240]  going to this fiber optic thanks to your great work going through hell on earth and having
[1:41:25.240 --> 1:41:28.920]  meetings with all these big companies and having them actually running into us that's now being done
[1:41:29.640 --> 1:41:34.680]  so great job on that front but but i just want to make a decision we're going to go with this at
[1:41:34.680 --> 1:41:41.560]  three o'clock that'll give you guys two hours to do a workaround and it doesn't have to be anything
[1:41:41.560 --> 1:41:45.240]  fancy i know erin was up until three in the morning so he won't be until later we have a couple uh
[1:41:45.240 --> 1:41:50.040]  rob is out of town some other webmasters are gone he went to visit family in new york we need to go
[1:41:50.040 --> 1:41:57.800]  ahead and we can just have a basic page that says uh follow the republic members click here and then
[1:41:57.800 --> 1:42:04.200]  it just goes to the back end and then we can just have it on players there for them on just a great
[1:42:04.200 --> 1:42:09.640]  page instead of it all being the big fancy um whatever system we have right now is a jumbola
[1:42:10.360 --> 1:42:15.960]  jumbola yeah you want to go to drupal i'm a fan of drupal i'm trying to learn all this stuff the
[1:42:15.960 --> 1:42:22.600]  point is is that uh now the site's up and down right it's it's acting very slow because of all
[1:42:22.600 --> 1:42:29.240]  the traffic that's hitting it the site is is staying up technically but it's not just as responsive
[1:42:29.240 --> 1:42:33.400]  and forthcoming as before because of all the additional traffic and you're having trouble
[1:42:33.400 --> 1:42:41.000]  even getting into it yeah we're we're going to do this um alternative entry point for the for the
[1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:46.680]  release so that we can have take the strain off the main site so we can and it may be four five
[1:42:46.680 --> 1:42:53.240]  six o'clock now that's not what we're going to we're going to go for but we're definitely going
[1:42:53.240 --> 1:42:57.800]  to go for three o'clock if we need to drive a mile down the road and get erin out of bed
[1:42:58.360 --> 1:43:01.240]  that's why i got to hire more people but i'm also worried about infiltrators i got a hard two or
[1:43:01.240 --> 1:43:05.960]  three more webmasters so i got the watson's in england i got kurt nemo kurt nemo could do stuff
[1:43:05.960 --> 1:43:10.040]  remotely i guess i don't know if he understands the prison planet dot tv system i guess watson
[1:43:10.040 --> 1:43:15.080]  would be the guy he's the guy that understands it the best i'll get a hold well definitely we'll
[1:43:15.080 --> 1:43:19.480]  have a kind of a roundtable discussion on what and again we had to have this discussion live on
[1:43:19.480 --> 1:43:23.880]  error or i would have had to go off air to have the discussion we're having right now yeah but
[1:43:23.880 --> 1:43:28.840]  but i just we had a three minute i mean was that your plan because i'm just throwing out my plan
[1:43:28.840 --> 1:43:33.400]  isn't isn't the actual member interface different from the server we're talking about
[1:43:34.360 --> 1:43:40.440]  yes but then we have the videos posted on the interface that is this server
[1:43:41.000 --> 1:43:45.880]  it not not streamed from that server but the interface of the prison planet dot tv that
[1:43:45.880 --> 1:43:49.720]  has the eye candy and looks good yeah the problem's the eye candy yeah pretty much it's
[1:43:49.720 --> 1:43:55.400]  it's that front end it's the wrapper you know the candy is stored somewhere else but the rapper
[1:43:55.400 --> 1:44:01.640]  right now is it's what's uh better analogy yes yeah to uh that's what's getting us right now is is that
[1:44:01.640 --> 1:44:12.920]  wrapper and how much will it cost me to get around this i mean in the future so um it's a
[1:44:12.920 --> 1:44:19.240]  matter of architecture archer um more this decentralized more well it's not you guys fault
[1:44:19.240 --> 1:44:24.520]  you you guys doing the job of 10 people and we never had this problem before but but but again
[1:44:24.520 --> 1:44:28.680]  with just members there's not that many members this shouldn't be happening i guess because i saw
[1:44:28.680 --> 1:44:31.720]  the internet ablaze last night this morning where is it where is it so i guess everybody's looking
[1:44:31.720 --> 1:44:36.920]  for for free here's the problem guys that want it for free i basically end up giving the films out
[1:44:36.920 --> 1:44:40.920]  for free but i have to put people on airplanes to fly to the interviews i have to have the video
[1:44:40.920 --> 1:44:45.160]  editors i have to have the software i have to have the computers i have to pay for the music i
[1:44:45.160 --> 1:44:49.240]  have to pay for the composers i have to pay for the sound engineers i have to pay for the dvd
[1:44:49.240 --> 1:44:56.280]  authoring replication distribution shipping the shipping department um if i didn't let people
[1:44:56.280 --> 1:44:58.840]  pirate these and sell them and and and do all the stuff they do
[1:45:00.440 --> 1:45:04.600]  our money problems would be over here but then people also convince and complain then when i get
[1:45:04.600 --> 1:45:08.440]  up here with sponsors that fund everything and this is not free we're not funded by george
[1:45:08.440 --> 1:45:12.760]  soros folks who's attacking me in his publications every day you know we're on the enemy's list
[1:45:12.760 --> 1:45:15.400]  because we're doing this on our own i know most of you understand that but some of the
[1:45:15.400 --> 1:45:19.400]  co-interpreter always go in and just comment comment how dare alex asks for money how dare alex
[1:45:19.400 --> 1:45:24.120]  try to fund things how dare alex do this how dare alex do that well what planet do they think
[1:45:24.120 --> 1:45:28.200]  we're living on i mean i i'm i'm even having trouble making the film and delivering it to you
[1:45:28.200 --> 1:45:32.760]  because of money and then and then also i have saved some money in reserves so we can defend
[1:45:32.760 --> 1:45:37.560]  ourselves from lawsuits if they happen so we can continue to operate of the entire economy shuts
[1:45:37.560 --> 1:45:44.040]  down uh i will sell everything i own and all of our reserves to fund this place and literally
[1:45:44.040 --> 1:45:49.160]  we've got big cases of ammo in our foxhole to fire through our howitzer but we need your support
[1:45:49.160 --> 1:45:54.920]  that's why we are one hour and 45 minutes in today and i haven't plugged a single sponsor live on air
[1:45:54.920 --> 1:46:00.680]  i haven't plugged the the film to go buy it info wars.com the very first please purchase the dvd
[1:46:00.680 --> 1:46:05.640]  that's what's great about low tech it's the highest quality you have the dvd and you're supporting us
[1:46:05.640 --> 1:46:09.560]  go to info war we've been shipping these things out for a couple days a lot of people are going
[1:46:09.560 --> 1:46:14.280]  to be getting them anyways today so we've got to hell or high water get this out to the members today
[1:46:14.280 --> 1:46:18.760]  but i also want to thank the members of prison planet dot tv you're the folks that actually
[1:46:18.760 --> 1:46:24.120]  fund what we're doing you're you know you're putting uh major support into what we're doing and
[1:46:24.120 --> 1:46:28.280]  we couldn't do this without you the prison planet dot tv members and and for those that are long
[1:46:28.280 --> 1:46:32.680]  time members we've had it for more than five years now five and a half years since april five years
[1:46:32.680 --> 1:46:37.480]  ago uh you're who's made all this possible and you've seen the site get better and better and
[1:46:37.480 --> 1:46:42.120]  quicker and quicker and we're going to add so much it's just it's hard when you're small to build
[1:46:42.120 --> 1:46:47.240]  the next level but we're we're we're almost done with the launch pad now for the next level of this
[1:46:47.240 --> 1:46:53.480]  operation it's pretty exciting isn't it oh yeah definitely the foundation is being built and it's
[1:46:53.480 --> 1:46:58.520]  i mean you want to do a constructionality we're we're putting in big thick pieces of rebar we're
[1:46:58.520 --> 1:47:03.480]  getting the best concrete you know it's everything is being padded down and the foundation for
[1:47:03.480 --> 1:47:14.040]  or going ballistic is is there going ballistic is right to the moon without a rocket oh yeah oh yeah
[1:47:15.080 --> 1:47:19.800]  as ralph kramden would say yeah we're definitely it's the foundation is getting there and we're
[1:47:19.800 --> 1:47:25.480]  we're going to the next level again we've got to stay small because infiltration is a very real
[1:47:25.480 --> 1:47:28.920]  problem not that we're doing anything wrong here people will come in here and try to do
[1:47:28.920 --> 1:47:37.000]  to commit crimes to put me in prison we've already dealt with this and just a very very serious
[1:47:37.880 --> 1:47:44.360]  situation i hear my iphone going off uh well pointless uh to babble about that thank you matt
[1:47:44.360 --> 1:47:49.080]  listen we're going to go ahead and try to launch it three give yourself some space if you need to
[1:47:51.160 --> 1:47:54.760]  all the other films we released a day early to kind of sneak attack the enemy because we have
[1:47:54.760 --> 1:47:59.880]  been hit with hack attacks i know we're not the type of website and operation that when we have a
[1:47:59.880 --> 1:48:07.720]  mistake or a problem or a bunch of traffic that come on back in matt that that that that that we
[1:48:08.920 --> 1:48:16.440]  blame things uh on hackers but we've had real hackers go in and take over the front page and
[1:48:16.440 --> 1:48:21.000]  post a naked woman on the motorcycle before we've had people send out other types of attacks in our
[1:48:21.000 --> 1:48:26.920]  name we have had the ports attack when i was doing the flu story that was definitely a certified attack
[1:48:26.920 --> 1:48:35.240]  going through explain what that attack was like yeah that was basically a large denial of strip
[1:48:36.360 --> 1:48:41.720]  distributed denial of service attack that occurred that was just bombarding us with all
[1:48:42.280 --> 1:48:46.920]  all facets of the of the world we're sending out these requests to hit our servers that but more
[1:48:46.920 --> 1:48:51.640]  than that you guys were telling me that they actually went around our main ports and found
[1:48:51.640 --> 1:48:57.880]  secret ports they were just yeah they were we have things that are listening or you know we don't
[1:48:57.880 --> 1:49:02.440]  have a lot and then we would flip a port and they flipped to that within minutes yeah they were
[1:49:02.440 --> 1:49:07.560]  basically uh the the term is like port scanning so as soon as we moved a port around they would hit
[1:49:07.560 --> 1:49:12.920]  us on that a port so it was basically move do you think we're going to find because of the size
[1:49:12.920 --> 1:49:20.360]  of this being so big that it's interest or could it be an attack i would i would say most of this
[1:49:20.360 --> 1:49:25.000]  could be interest but we'll have to we'll have to take a look at at all the data that we but last
[1:49:25.000 --> 1:49:30.440]  time it was definitely an attack yeah that because it's just a wide variety of where it was coming
[1:49:30.440 --> 1:49:36.040]  from and just the repeated nature of the hits and they call those what zombie computers they take
[1:49:36.040 --> 1:49:41.800]  everybody's computers into it yeah they when your system on a like a window system gets infected
[1:49:41.800 --> 1:49:47.960]  they can use that as a zombie what you can be used as a uh a launch pad for and they were using
[1:49:47.960 --> 1:49:55.880]  university servers in japan australia yeah this was worldwide a lot of most of it was overseas
[1:49:55.880 --> 1:50:01.160]  south korea because they got the really fast stuff oh yeah they got the big fat uh fiber pipes over
[1:50:01.160 --> 1:50:05.640]  there going to the everybody's houses over there which is a great launch pad for zombies since it
[1:50:05.640 --> 1:50:11.880]  has that high capacity where and it could just flood that pipe i don't know how stupid the establishment
[1:50:11.880 --> 1:50:15.640]  is if this turns out to be an attack and we'll do a forensic analysis on it and find out later
[1:50:16.200 --> 1:50:20.360]  because you know here i am in roll call we are on the white house enemies list it's not just
[1:50:21.560 --> 1:50:26.600]  coming out of the globe and mail now i mean we are now on the enemies list and they are pissed
[1:50:26.600 --> 1:50:31.000]  i mean all these big mainstream publications are saying the establishment is afraid of these films
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:34.520]  and i mean you jackasses ought to know you're not going to stop this film coming out if that's what
[1:50:34.520 --> 1:50:39.400]  this is no we there's ways of getting around we've got it ready to drop free on the web at five

[1:55:14.360 --> 1:55:18.920]  recent listener i should say one to call and thank you for doing all your doing uh
[1:55:19.560 --> 1:55:25.160]  recently with deltas h1a one stuff i was just like the zombies out there that didn't know anything
[1:55:25.160 --> 1:55:31.960]  about it work in a hospital may we're distributing it and i simply refused and what shocking to me
[1:55:31.960 --> 1:55:38.520]  is that other people around me didn't know why i was refusing the shot and i told them do you
[1:55:38.520 --> 1:55:46.120]  even really know what's in this vaccine and they you know and and it's just alarming to see this
[1:55:46.120 --> 1:55:51.720]  kind of response all around also act like you're a kook and a weirdo i don't want to put words
[1:55:51.720 --> 1:55:58.360]  in your mouth do they act like you were weird well they do um i work in the pharmacy and the
[1:55:58.360 --> 1:56:04.280]  firms that's all around me were yeah they just looked at me like i was zombified but then meanwhile
[1:56:04.280 --> 1:56:09.800]  but then meanwhile the polls are reporting that in england over 70 percent over 60 percent the
[1:56:09.800 --> 1:56:15.960]  us are refusing it so 60 percent of us are cooks you know over 90 percent major polls believe the
[1:56:15.960 --> 1:56:20.680]  government killed kennedy and more evidence comes out every day that they did and it's now been
[1:56:20.680 --> 1:56:26.360]  confirmed he did work for the cia that's mainstream news lee harvey oswald but but still 92 percent
[1:56:26.360 --> 1:56:31.080]  of us are cooks but the 8 percent they're normal and we're all nuts and if you talk about a world
[1:56:31.080 --> 1:56:35.960]  government you're a nut as the news announces world government i mean it just doesn't work anymore
[1:56:35.960 --> 1:56:42.520]  it really hit me last night it really hit me between the eyes just how crazy it is they put
[1:56:42.520 --> 1:56:47.800]  fluoride and hundreds of other toxic chemicals in the water under the name fluoride knowing it
[1:56:47.800 --> 1:56:54.360]  hurts us hardly anybody wants it but they still do it they just don't care they're criminals and
[1:56:54.360 --> 1:57:00.520]  the bigger question is why are we putting up with this crap why get it out of our water why do i have
[1:57:00.520 --> 1:57:04.600]  to filter everything and go through hell here in austin and still my kids take showers in your
[1:57:04.600 --> 1:57:09.240]  fluoride water even though i got some filters they don't cut it all out just get it out of my water
[1:57:10.040 --> 1:57:17.720]  stop forcibly medicating me you bastards i'm sorry go ahead um no i just it's alarming to see in my
[1:57:17.720 --> 1:57:23.240]  mother i got a i got a call from her yesterday and she's so sweet and so nice but she's under the
[1:57:23.240 --> 1:57:28.200]  influence of the mainstream media she called me and i and i didn't see the segment but she was
[1:57:28.200 --> 1:57:33.800]  talking to me about a sunday segment that's 60 minutes had about this fear mongering at the
[1:57:33.800 --> 1:57:39.400]  stage one in one and i was born with a bronchial asthma and she calls me and she goes kevin i
[1:57:39.400 --> 1:57:44.840]  really want you to get this because you have asthma and you're very fragile like mother no
[1:57:44.840 --> 1:57:50.120]  i do not know what's in it and they will not publish what exactly is in it and i just cannot
[1:57:50.120 --> 1:57:56.600]  believe the stranglehold that they have on the people around me and not myself are you a pharmacist
[1:57:56.600 --> 1:58:03.080]  or a pharmacist assistant i'm a tech which is a pharmacist assistant you're a tech uh i mean on
[1:58:03.080 --> 1:58:07.160]  the inserts and they do have some proprietary things that they you know just list is ender
[1:58:07.160 --> 1:58:12.840]  lukeans and things but it admittedly has the adjuvant mercury in it that's admitted it admittedly
[1:58:12.840 --> 1:58:17.240]  says it can give you gillian beret on the insert it admittedly says all of that i mean do the
[1:58:17.240 --> 1:58:24.120]  pharmacists not care it just seemed it it it seems like it they had a handout that they gave
[1:58:24.120 --> 1:58:27.960]  they had a stack of the handouts about the benefits and all that it seemed like a general just
[1:58:27.960 --> 1:58:34.040]  listing of the shot and i've seen the boxes themselves of the actual flu vaccine that that

[1:58:55.240 --> 1:58:59.560]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[1:58:59.560 --> 1:59:04.600]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[1:59:04.600 --> 1:59:10.200]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[1:59:10.200 --> 1:59:15.320]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[1:59:15.320 --> 1:59:20.600]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[1:59:20.600 --> 1:59:25.240]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[1:59:25.240 --> 1:59:30.600]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[1:59:30.600 --> 1:59:35.000]  peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science

[2:00:31.480 --> 2:00:38.440]  ton of news to cover your phone calls kevin i have the mayo clinic you're a pharmacy tech
[2:00:38.440 --> 2:00:47.960]  i have the mayo clinic insert with the live nasal delivery flu vaccine as it's technically named
[2:00:48.600 --> 2:00:54.280]  and it says may cause gilliam beret syndrome may cause cancer may cause infertility it may
[2:00:54.280 --> 2:01:01.240]  mutate in the nasal cavity and spread live virus and i was watching fox news yesterday morning
[2:01:01.240 --> 2:01:06.040]  and they were showing shots of flu vaccine and it said live virus on the side of the box
[2:01:06.040 --> 2:01:10.280]  but you you got cut off by the break when you were talking about the insert go ahead
[2:01:11.080 --> 2:01:17.240]  well the insert itself i mean you and i and the other viewers i think the information is
[2:01:17.240 --> 2:01:21.960]  truly out there people want to look at it the main point is that when i look in the box insert
[2:01:21.960 --> 2:01:28.600]  and also the page the 8 by 11 page that the hospital gave listing all the benefits they
[2:01:28.600 --> 2:01:33.160]  did not list every single ingredient you know the every adjuvant and all that
[2:01:33.160 --> 2:01:40.360]  that was the live virus that is in the vaccine i thought there was very alarming that they didn't
[2:01:40.920 --> 2:01:44.440]  include everything that was even in the official
[2:01:45.160 --> 2:01:49.800]  aren't they supposed to do that by law aren't they i guess under an emergency though they don't
[2:01:49.800 --> 2:01:55.800]  have to well i mean it just it just depends on makes you wonder because you know i've i've
[2:01:55.800 --> 2:01:59.560]  done my own research and you know with the help of you you know the work you do and

[2:02:09.480 --> 2:02:13.560]  pharmacist all the german and british news with the government officials won't take it

[2:13:48.600 --> 2:13:52.120]  you march them down there and have them give it to them over the and then say now why is the media
[2:13:52.120 --> 2:13:57.560]  lying saying none of this is in there and it can't do this to you and then you may break
[2:13:57.560 --> 2:14:02.520]  somebody's conditioning right there let me tell the police you trust the government that's giving
[2:14:02.520 --> 2:14:07.480]  you all this power to violate our rights and telling you it's for our own good well go find out
[2:14:08.120 --> 2:14:13.640]  that they know that squalene and mercury brain damage the troops the army in its own reports
[2:14:13.640 --> 2:14:18.520]  has confirmed they quit given the anthrax shot with it because it was killing them and maiming them
[2:14:18.520 --> 2:14:25.240]  the time for screwing around is over let's go back for a second question from surely then we're
[2:14:25.240 --> 2:14:29.480]  going to go to uh mike denise steven others go ahead surely what was your second question
[2:14:30.280 --> 2:14:37.320]  okay um my second question was yesterday when you had um the pastor on he was stating that
[2:14:37.320 --> 2:14:42.200]  the government i mean not the government but the individual he was speaking with from the elite
[2:14:42.200 --> 2:14:47.400]  was informing him that within two years time a majority of everyone would be working for the
[2:14:47.400 --> 2:14:53.800]  government um my question was do you think that that is a way that they're going to try to manipulate
[2:14:53.800 --> 2:14:58.680]  everyone to get into the fema camps do you think they're going to tie that in some way to make us
[2:14:58.680 --> 2:15:05.880]  think that we're going there to work or no no exactly we understand their their mindset
[2:15:07.160 --> 2:15:16.120]  and how they operate but if you go back years ago i said they're going to advertise the camps
[2:15:16.120 --> 2:15:21.560]  as work centers they're going to advertise them as welfare centers to get your free health care
[2:15:21.560 --> 2:15:26.360]  they're going to advertise friday night that a country band or rock and roll band is going to come
[2:15:26.360 --> 2:15:32.280]  in they're going to advertise oh look the army helps the local police now oh look we're stopping drunk
[2:15:32.280 --> 2:15:38.200]  drivers and we're stopping bank robbers with on-star kill switches in the cars that's now happening
[2:15:38.200 --> 2:15:43.640]  us news and world report today that will show people that article they're going to advertise it
[2:15:43.640 --> 2:15:51.880]  all like it's a good thing and then just slowly but surely phase all this in and and when lindsay
[2:15:51.880 --> 2:15:56.680]  talks about everybody working with the government he means big select corporations will operate off
[2:15:56.680 --> 2:16:03.800]  of government bailouts and government contracts and the only part of the economy growing is the
[2:16:03.800 --> 2:16:09.480]  government there'll be classic government jobs the new enforcer jobs the new enforcers on the farms
[2:16:09.480 --> 2:16:13.240]  the ranches harassing people i have mainstream articles were all over the country homeland
[2:16:13.240 --> 2:16:19.240]  securities funding the local police and others to set up checkpoints and harass people with
[2:16:19.240 --> 2:16:24.760]  their horses and their cows they're moving around to sail or to another another farm another field
[2:16:25.720 --> 2:16:30.200]  checkpoints any way to shut the highways down train everybody to accept this
[2:16:31.880 --> 2:16:36.840]  it's all happening and so it's going to be incremental i appreciate your call until they
[2:16:36.840 --> 2:16:42.120]  stage a nuke attack or some big crisis and really drop the hammer uh let's go ahead and talk to mic
[2:16:42.120 --> 2:16:48.680]  in minnesota you're on the air mic so like i salute you general jones how are you doing pretty good
[2:16:49.720 --> 2:16:59.720]  uh i got a question for you um you uh turned us on up here to the uh uss boxer and the people
[2:16:59.720 --> 2:17:04.360]  that died there and i in turn turned them up here the people up in minnesota to it nobody'd
[2:17:04.360 --> 2:17:10.520]  heard about it up here how come they took everything off the websites what websites
[2:17:10.520 --> 2:17:14.840]  are you talking about well yours uh my you know there are people up here ask them we've never
[2:17:14.840 --> 2:17:20.600]  heard anything about it and uh but i mean wait a minute we we are you sure you just can't find it
[2:17:20.600 --> 2:17:25.720]  on my site well i don't have a computer but the guy i work and i call in and talk into a local
[2:17:25.720 --> 2:17:30.920]  radio talk show up here before your show and they couldn't find it on your site they pulled it and
[2:17:30.920 --> 2:17:37.640]  he's pretty good tech guy yeah well we we very rarely maybe every couple months pull something
[2:17:37.640 --> 2:17:41.880]  because i don't control all my webmasters and posters and they've usually got a good good
[2:17:41.880 --> 2:17:48.200]  feeling for what's real what's accurate and so i very rarely tell them to pull something that
[2:17:48.200 --> 2:17:54.040]  we've linked to or posted more often than not we'll we'll we'll post not a retraction because it's
[2:17:54.040 --> 2:17:59.960]  not our article but we'll we'll post a clarification i don't remember ever ordering something pulled
[2:17:59.960 --> 2:18:05.960]  and so uh i have a sneaking suspicion the person doesn't remember the exact headline uh
[2:18:07.160 --> 2:18:15.000]  we did not report that people died on the boxer we reported from bob Chapman and other sources
[2:18:15.560 --> 2:18:21.960]  before it was even in the media that there was a quarantine on not one ship but four ships i'm
[2:18:21.960 --> 2:18:28.040]  going from memory and that some were saying bob was saying and he's a credible guy i'm going from
[2:18:28.040 --> 2:18:32.520]  memory on this because i didn't really report on it much other shows made a really big deal out of
[2:18:32.520 --> 2:18:37.960]  it that there had been deaths and we were waiting to see what happened so uh you're asking me where
[2:18:37.960 --> 2:18:44.120]  it is or what's going on uh i i ignored it the first few days people said have you heard there's
[2:18:44.120 --> 2:18:49.720]  deaths on these ships and i said well we did see deaths on other military bases with the last two
[2:18:49.720 --> 2:18:56.520]  swine flu outbreaks that's where the government launches it in 76 and 1918 and so i said that
[2:18:56.520 --> 2:19:02.360]  may be something to that uh and i said and then and then it came out in the news that there was
[2:19:02.360 --> 2:19:07.880]  a quarantine on some ships so so so i'm not really the expert to be able to speak to that because
[2:19:07.880 --> 2:19:13.720]  what i just told you there's the article there's the article it is on info wars.com it has not
[2:19:13.720 --> 2:19:19.800]  been removed it's live at prisonplanet.tv right now bob Chapman talks about suspicious
[2:19:19.800 --> 2:19:28.280]  flu deaths on us navy ship and it's a link to a youtube video of bob Chapman talking about that
[2:19:28.280 --> 2:19:33.480]  are are you at a computer they're uh might no i don't have a computer i'm off the grid
[2:19:33.480 --> 2:19:37.640]  okay well just punch it back up i want to give that headline out three more times bob Chapman
[2:19:37.640 --> 2:19:43.480]  talks about suspicious flu deaths on us navy ships bob Chapman talks about suspicious flu deaths

[2:26:05.080 --> 2:26:12.360]  launch going back to calls let's talk to denise in texas you're on the air denise welcome hello how
[2:26:12.360 --> 2:26:20.600]  you doing well i'm pretty good i'm sorry about your loss by the way hey alex you have said in the
[2:26:20.600 --> 2:26:30.520]  past that hollywood movies are sometimes a heads up from the elite yes okay i was listening to
[2:26:30.520 --> 2:26:36.040]  this crazy balloon boy thing and i thought caught myself thinking this is right out of 12 monkeys
[2:26:36.040 --> 2:26:42.520]  and then i realized what 12 monkeys was really about um eugenics where they release a bio weapon
[2:26:42.520 --> 2:26:49.320]  that kills 99.9 percent of the world's population exactly and i was wondering could this could this
[2:26:49.320 --> 2:26:54.520]  be our heads up but then i got to but you know it's been a couple days and nothing has actually
[2:26:54.520 --> 2:27:02.200]  happened so i guess well maybe not now i think that was just a stunt by some people that were dying
[2:27:02.200 --> 2:27:08.760]  to have a tv show okay because you remember in that movie the kid is hiding in the barn in that movie
[2:27:10.360 --> 2:27:14.360]  you remember i don't know if you remember bruce willis that they're they're from the whole movie
[2:27:14.360 --> 2:27:19.080]  they're digging out the kid that's in the well and bruce willis keeps playing the kids in the barn
[2:27:19.080 --> 2:27:25.560]  it's it's a hoax it's a hoax and so that's that's what got me well that was about how the media
[2:27:25.560 --> 2:27:31.640]  had a big distraction and how the establishment uses big distractions like that right before they
[2:27:31.640 --> 2:27:36.360]  launched something really big but yes it's i need to watch that film again it is definitely
[2:27:37.400 --> 2:27:42.120]  also what happens in hollywood a lot of it's paid for a lot of its propaganda a lot of it is
[2:27:42.120 --> 2:27:49.960]  new world order but then i have to know some other directors who put out films like a scan or
[2:27:49.960 --> 2:27:57.480]  darkly and that has new world or imagery in it on purpose because i was one of the consultants on it
[2:27:59.240 --> 2:28:03.640]  for tommy pilota and richard link letter to throw new world order in your face that it's the new
[2:28:03.640 --> 2:28:09.720]  world order getting everyone addicted to this drug that turns them into zombie slaves and i
[2:28:09.720 --> 2:28:13.880]  announced it was going to have new world orders imagery and people said oh we found hidden imagery
[2:28:13.880 --> 2:28:19.720]  in it yes it's not hidden it's in plain view i've talked to other hollywood people but then
[2:28:19.720 --> 2:28:26.200]  rick link letter had to fight with the studio just to keep a scene in there where a cop executes a
[2:28:26.200 --> 2:28:31.800]  guy and shoots him in the head they didn't even want that what they saw as an anti police message
[2:28:31.800 --> 2:28:38.120]  in there and they cut a few little other scenes some of the stuff stayed in so i've seen on the inside
[2:28:38.120 --> 2:28:45.240]  the directors and people trying to trying to get their vision out that's good while the
[2:28:45.240 --> 2:28:51.960]  establishment tries to stop that so it's not a hundred percent control but under obama it's
[2:28:51.960 --> 2:28:57.880]  really starting to move towards that does that answer your question also something real quick
[2:28:57.880 --> 2:29:04.040]  something that i've been listening to you for a while but i'm i'm confused and sometimes you tell
[2:29:04.040 --> 2:29:09.000]  me when you when you say well there's two different factions of the illuminati that makes some sense
[2:29:09.000 --> 2:29:15.560]  but the people that lindsay williams is talking to the guy do you think he's he's one of these
[2:29:15.560 --> 2:29:21.320]  depopulation is because he never really talks about that he's talking about financial crashes and
[2:29:21.320 --> 2:29:25.320]  and you know all that stuff but he's not really talking about i think it's going to be a limited
[2:29:25.320 --> 2:29:30.280]  perspective only talking to one person but it's an interesting window and then also there's what's
[2:29:30.280 --> 2:29:34.200]  that person holding back what is that person really saying you know i don't think you can
[2:29:34.200 --> 2:29:39.000]  just take that one individual saying this and then and then make the whole world about that
[2:29:39.000 --> 2:29:43.560]  because the prediction was right i think it's important needs to be looked at but but there's
[2:29:43.560 --> 2:29:47.240]  two different factions but it's like a man and woman who are in a marriage they're still going
[2:29:47.240 --> 2:30:01.000]  for the same agenda we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[2:37:36.840 --> 2:37:42.120]  criminal government the illegitimate government attacking iran the hell iran has gone through
[2:37:42.120 --> 2:37:46.600]  it's just i want americans to know what the globalists are doing in our names trying to get iran to
[2:37:46.600 --> 2:37:52.280]  launch attacks i also want paul's in some big reports on the flu fair mongering uh that's
[2:37:52.280 --> 2:37:57.720]  going on and a lot more and follow the republic but paul let's get your take on follow the republic
[2:37:57.720 --> 2:38:03.160]  first uh you have seen the film you've written reviews of the film you and your brother have
[2:38:03.160 --> 2:38:08.840]  both written articles i didn't ask you to uh to uh you know what to say or do in the articles
[2:38:08.840 --> 2:38:14.200]  this is your best review ever of any of my films briefly give us your take on fall the republic
[2:38:15.640 --> 2:38:23.080]  well yeah i watched it in fall uh a few days ago and basically it's the most um high quality
[2:38:23.080 --> 2:38:29.080]  production of any film that i've ever seen you put out and bear in mind that you know i was
[2:38:29.080 --> 2:38:36.760]  watching your films back in uh before 2001 when i first got into all this so the progression from
[2:38:37.480 --> 2:38:45.160]  those early films america destroyed by design um police state 2000 police state 2 the progression
[2:38:45.160 --> 2:38:52.360]  is clear and some of the graphics some of the illustrations you use to um illustrate the points
[2:38:52.360 --> 2:39:00.920]  you make in fall of the republic is just such a high quality and in the the review that my brother
[2:39:00.920 --> 2:39:07.560]  wrote which seems to be the one that spurred this massive bombardment of interest from what people
[2:39:07.560 --> 2:39:15.080]  are saying on the forum which is good i mean he he compares it to something like michael moore's new
[2:39:15.080 --> 2:39:20.120]  film now there is the difference between other michael moore is that you know we don't make
[2:39:20.120 --> 2:39:25.480]  20 million plus gross on every film we put out so we don't have the kind of money that
[2:39:25.480 --> 2:39:32.760]  michael moore has to put into it 20 million he made 300 million on fahrenheit i'm just going
[2:39:32.760 --> 2:39:39.000]  off the numbers of his most recent film so far but yeah we don't have 300 million dollars to put
[2:39:39.000 --> 2:39:48.520]  into it um but in terms of its hard-hitting nature and the absolutely vital preeminence
[2:39:48.520 --> 2:39:54.280]  of the information contained in fall of the republic then you know it ranks above that
[2:39:55.320 --> 2:39:59.880]  and the stuff on the cap and trade is the most important the stuff on global warming
[2:39:59.880 --> 2:40:06.760]  you've got timothy ball phd on there talking about how um climate skeptics are being derided
[2:40:06.760 --> 2:40:12.680]  and smeared as holocaust deniers that we've got another story out on that today and that's all
[2:40:12.680 --> 2:40:18.440]  the stuff about al gore and his involvement in the carbon trading swindle which he jointly
[2:40:18.440 --> 2:40:26.680]  owns with the roth child family is just so damning and exposing and uh i mean that's the key segment
[2:40:26.680 --> 2:40:31.480]  of the film for me and it's just a tour de force basically it's two and a half nearly two and a
[2:40:31.480 --> 2:40:39.160]  half hours long more than that with the extras and it's a tour de force it's the um complimentary
[2:40:39.160 --> 2:40:46.280]  sequel to the obama deception and um as we've emphasized and pushed in all the review articles
[2:40:46.280 --> 2:40:52.280]  we've put out we encourage people to get it and make copies and make copies on the internet
[2:40:52.280 --> 2:40:57.320]  and spread it to the four corners of the world because as you've said many times the obama
[2:40:57.320 --> 2:41:03.160]  deception has received tens of millions of views in total and that's what start the establishment
[2:41:03.160 --> 2:41:09.240]  freaking out especially over the past six months it's intensified because we're having a great
[2:41:09.240 --> 2:41:14.280]  effect of waking a lot of people up and that's been reflected in the amount of people who are
[2:41:14.280 --> 2:41:20.360]  refusing this swine flu vaccine which we'll get on to talk about and the film covers who the
[2:41:20.360 --> 2:41:27.000]  bankers are their master plan how either we bring them to justice or they become the private heads
[2:41:27.000 --> 2:41:32.040]  and owners of the planetary government we get into the entire latest developments in the police
[2:41:32.040 --> 2:41:40.920]  state grid uh eugenics tv mind control and the main message is the world government's now here
[2:41:40.920 --> 2:41:46.680]  it's now happening this is our last chance to stand up against these people they're moving
[2:41:46.680 --> 2:41:52.200]  in against us they have a lot of power but they're also weak as they reveal themselves all the
[2:41:52.200 --> 2:41:59.160]  debates about world government existing or not existing are now over this has their own words
[2:41:59.160 --> 2:42:04.120]  their own documents their own video clips their own statements it is shockingly well done the whole

[2:44:45.480 --> 2:44:52.440]  situation trying to get that war going uh the establishment is go ahead well the situation
[2:44:52.440 --> 2:45:01.160]  with slime flu is the vast numbers of people all over the world have rejected it now remember
[2:45:01.160 --> 2:45:07.400]  when this was first getting ready to be introduced um in you know they first announced it a couple
[2:45:07.400 --> 2:45:14.040]  of months after the outbreak around june july virtually all major western governments and others
[2:45:14.680 --> 2:45:20.440]  said that it was going to be a quote mass vaccination campaign now if they weren't going
[2:45:20.440 --> 2:45:26.440]  to enforce it via mandatory injection they were at least going to try and make as many people as
[2:45:26.440 --> 2:45:33.240]  possible take it most of the population that bought enough vaccines to cover the vast majority of the
[2:45:33.240 --> 2:45:40.600]  population if not more but what's happened is that i mean the people who were opposing it
[2:45:40.600 --> 2:45:47.400]  who have now been labeled the anti-vaccine lobby as if it's a lobby when the real pharmaceutical
[2:45:47.400 --> 2:45:53.880]  lobby spends over a hundred million dollars a year every year hundred million they spend
[2:45:53.880 --> 2:45:59.400]  but there's billions on vaccine ads alone paul go ahead i'm talking about the lobby in washington
[2:45:59.400 --> 2:46:05.320]  they've got 12 at least 1200 lobby oh not the advertising you mean just the lobbyist got you
[2:46:05.320 --> 2:46:13.640]  just the lobbyist yeah and we've got a situation now wearing areas of america three quarters of
[2:46:13.640 --> 2:46:20.360]  firefighters are rejecting it half of the nurses and health professionals if not more are rejecting
[2:46:20.360 --> 2:46:29.560]  it they're protesting about it in europe denmark finland germany france spain belgium holland
[2:46:29.560 --> 2:46:35.560]  the majority of the population and in some cases a significant majority including health
[2:46:35.560 --> 2:46:42.200]  professionals and firefighters and people like that are rejecting it and there's a mass uprising
[2:46:42.200 --> 2:46:46.760]  against it because of the information that's being put out by the people warning about what's in it
[2:46:47.560 --> 2:46:53.400]  now most people don't know that in america the federal government embarked on a campaign back
[2:46:53.400 --> 2:47:01.080]  in august where they spent 16 million dollars on a propaganda campaign to convince the public to
[2:47:01.080 --> 2:47:07.960]  take this wine flu vaccine and now we're beginning to see where this money is being spent you had
[2:47:07.960 --> 2:47:14.680]  the new york times come out last week we put out an article on this swine flu vaccine propaganda in
[2:47:14.680 --> 2:47:24.120]  new york times where they provide an educational supplement which is given to teachers for people
[2:47:24.120 --> 2:47:30.600]  from grade six to twelve this is taught in schools because the new york times has an agreement where
[2:47:30.600 --> 2:47:37.160]  it gets this propaganda put through the schooling system and these kids are given this quote fact
[2:47:37.160 --> 2:47:46.680]  sheet called h1n1 vaccine facts or myths and it lists nine myths about the swine flu vaccine
[2:47:46.680 --> 2:47:53.480]  and as we document in this article every single one of them is a fact it's not a myth there is
[2:47:53.480 --> 2:47:59.960]  mercury the marisol in the swine flu vaccine there is squalene in some of the flat swine flu
[2:47:59.960 --> 2:48:05.560]  vaccine and one of these so-called myths that the new york times lists in this educational
[2:48:05.560 --> 2:48:14.200]  supplement the children is the claim that the swine flu vaccine has no side effects whatsoever
[2:48:14.200 --> 2:48:17.800]  let me stop you this is what i was talking about the start of the hour
[2:48:18.680 --> 2:48:24.600]  that i see them on tv news saying there's no side effects no mercury no gillian beret no
[2:48:24.600 --> 2:48:31.000]  seizures when i just showed the insert from the vaccine saying it it's on all the medical
[2:48:31.000 --> 2:48:37.240]  sites and as your article states at prisonplanet.com this has got to get out to everybody they are
[2:48:37.240 --> 2:48:41.800]  lying not just in new york all over the country the same things happening from origan we've gotten
[2:48:41.800 --> 2:48:46.920]  sent these fact sheets from texas we've been sent them they lie and say none of it's true
[2:48:46.920 --> 2:48:52.760]  even if you believe in vaccines is it good to lie to everyone and say this isn't in there or
[2:48:52.760 --> 2:49:01.000]  that or this can happen i mean this is so incredible paul and then the others they say the myth that
[2:49:01.000 --> 2:49:06.760]  you can catch flu from the vaccine when held professionals in canada have spoken out repeatedly
[2:49:06.760 --> 2:49:13.160]  about the fact that the nasal myth contains live h1n1 virus that could spread the vaccine in people
[2:49:13.160 --> 2:49:18.120]  with weakened immune system well that's the major headlines all over the canadian news the government
[2:49:18.120 --> 2:49:23.800]  put out a warning saying it yeah but it's the myth according to this fact sheet that's going through
[2:49:23.800 --> 2:49:28.280]  all american schools well paul it's a myth they set up a bank of the world we're going to pay the
[2:49:28.280 --> 2:49:34.120]  carbon taxes to when it's in the times of london the Rothschilds run it along with al gore and
[2:49:34.120 --> 2:49:40.440]  that lord i mean that that's what i mean they just keep denying denying and no wonder some people
[2:49:40.440 --> 2:49:45.560]  out in the media and listening to the media think we're liars they tune in don't check that we're
[2:49:45.560 --> 2:49:51.480]  telling the truth and think we're complete liars because how could the media lie how could mainstream
[2:49:51.480 --> 2:49:59.480]  media lie they are lying go ahead paul yeah so if if the notion that the swine blue vaccine
[2:49:59.480 --> 2:50:07.000]  contains mercury is a myth and if if the claim that it has side effects potential side effects
[2:50:07.000 --> 2:50:14.680]  is a myth then maybe the new york times can answer the question as to why the top german
[2:50:14.680 --> 2:50:22.360]  government officials including the chancellor angela merkel the troops in germany the german army
[2:50:22.360 --> 2:50:30.760]  have been given an additive free swine blue vaccine that doesn't contain mercury now if all
[2:50:30.760 --> 2:50:36.440]  of them didn't contain mercury and they were all fine if i'm saying no other ingredients whatsoever
[2:50:36.440 --> 2:50:41.480]  then why stay there paul stay there stay there because i can barely hear you when we come back

[2:54:30.680 --> 2:54:35.240]  will be on star when police are chasing people they're lying and saying there's no mercury in
[2:54:35.240 --> 2:54:41.720]  the shots it can't cause infertility can't cause cancer but it's on the inserts here's the insert
[2:54:42.520 --> 2:54:52.360]  on the influenza A H1N1 2009 vaccine and here it says mercury right here you can go read the
[2:54:52.360 --> 2:55:01.240]  inserts i've got a adverse reaction sheet right here as well the ones that they actually give
[2:55:01.240 --> 2:55:12.520]  the doctors that's more detailed and it goes over all the different risk gillian beret syndrome
[2:55:13.400 --> 2:55:19.240]  this is from norvidus vaccine diagnostics limited this is from the biggest vaccine maker there's
[2:55:19.240 --> 2:55:24.280]  five companies making it oh here's from norvidus maybe the new york times should get this and i
[2:55:24.280 --> 2:55:29.240]  could keep going through all the cancer and all the infertility and everything else for people
[2:55:29.240 --> 2:55:34.360]  paul we've done this on show after show but i guess we're just liars paul i guess i wrote this up
[2:55:34.360 --> 2:55:41.000]  and lied about it and posted this uh but i didn't but that doesn't matter paul though they'll just
[2:55:41.000 --> 2:55:50.280]  lie and say it doesn't exist it's amazing though alec because there are two different versions of the swine flu vaccine one
[2:55:50.280 --> 2:55:56.600]  which was produced by a baxter has none of these additives in it whatsoever and that's the one that
[2:55:56.600 --> 2:56:01.880]  angela merkel and the german army and the top german officials have received no doubt that's the one
[2:56:01.880 --> 2:56:09.400]  that obama will be getting so why a why do they need why can't everybody get this quote green vaccine
[2:56:09.400 --> 2:56:16.760]  why do the ones that we get have to have mercury in that causes autism and squaly and these are animal
[2:56:16.760 --> 2:56:22.040]  cells that are cancerous that's what they have vaccine but the elite get one that preserve
[2:56:22.760 --> 2:56:29.880]  animal cells carrying cancer viruses that's the german snooze yeah it was in der spiegel
[2:56:30.520 --> 2:56:35.800]  um nimble wrote an article on it we already knew that five months ago with our scientists we had on
[2:56:35.800 --> 2:56:42.280]  but here it is all over the european press and i mean just go through the nine myth that we've
[2:56:42.280 --> 2:56:49.080]  got on this article one of them is says that the vaccine is untested that they're saying this is a
[2:56:49.080 --> 2:56:55.480]  myth manufacturers rush the production of the vaccine to get it to market that's admitted that
[2:56:55.480 --> 2:57:01.800]  was in the london times and the pharmaceutical companies themselves admit that yes it was never
[2:57:01.800 --> 2:57:06.120]  tested you can google that and see hundreds of mainstream articles but the new york times and
[2:57:06.120 --> 2:57:12.680]  the inserts that that they're giving school children all over the country say it isn't true
[2:57:14.120 --> 2:57:19.400]  we've got links to where they admit that it wasn't tested properly then that number seven is the
[2:57:19.400 --> 2:57:25.320]  vaccine the vaccine contains a dangerous adjuvant a chemical added to enhance the immune response
[2:57:25.320 --> 2:57:32.360]  they're saying that that's a myth when we know it contains the marisol and squaley and in fact the
[2:57:32.360 --> 2:57:39.720]  new york times itself reported on the fact that the non-additive h1m1 vaccines would be available
[2:57:39.720 --> 2:57:45.000]  but there wouldn't be enough for the general population so the times itself reports on it and
[2:57:45.000 --> 2:57:51.560]  then says it's a myth well that's why they're losing all credibility and now getting a government
[2:57:51.560 --> 2:57:56.280]  bailout and that's why obama's had public meetings saying the alternative media is a threat to
[2:57:56.280 --> 2:58:01.240]  newspapers the government and the mainstream media teaming up to censor us because of course
[2:58:01.240 --> 2:58:07.080]  they're going to lose we're telling the truth they're lying i mean it's unbelievable i mean
[2:58:07.080 --> 2:58:12.360]  these people are unbelievable this is paul this is a crime to sit there and lie and say this is
[2:58:12.360 --> 2:58:18.280]  actually from fda.gov this norvitas vaccine diagnostics limited give folks a close shot at

[3:00:27.160 --> 3:00:33.640]  prisonplanet.tv because members and the general public can't access the regular site with the
[3:00:33.640 --> 3:00:38.680]  thousands of videos audio my book paul watson's book so much more and after the traffic hump
[3:00:38.680 --> 3:00:43.080]  goes down that'll be back up it's up for some it's getting hit by so many but hopefully putting
[3:00:43.080 --> 3:00:47.640]  this simple page up will kill a lot of that traffic we're getting so the the main site will
[3:00:48.360 --> 3:00:52.920]  be accessible same thing happened with the sheen deal this happens more and more and we
[3:00:52.920 --> 3:00:58.600]  launched something big we just shut down so uh that is live there i'm going to keep watson a
[3:00:58.600 --> 3:01:03.400]  little bit in with tarpoli on the situation i ran then let him go in about 10 minutes but we'll go
[3:01:03.400 --> 3:01:10.760]  and get tarpoli on right now as well uh paul watson finishing up with the flu there's so many other
[3:01:10.760 --> 3:01:17.160]  facets to this the good news is the good news is people aren't buying the fraud the bad news is they
[3:01:17.160 --> 3:01:22.360]  admit that millions of people have taken the nasal live virus one that can breed it mutate it and
[3:01:22.360 --> 3:01:27.160]  spread it and now that's why 30 plus percent of the public's infected with it but not getting sick
[3:01:27.160 --> 3:01:31.400]  who knows what the virus is carrying because they've now proven there's all these sub particles
[3:01:31.400 --> 3:01:35.400]  and micro plasms they can engineer into it so i see a lot of different angles that are dangerous
[3:01:35.400 --> 3:01:42.840]  right there and i also have reports here swine flu cases overestimated cbs news exclusive study of
[3:01:42.840 --> 3:01:47.880]  rate of results find h1n1 not as prevalent as feared i told you this months ago with medical
[3:01:47.880 --> 3:01:55.240]  doctors false reporting hyping lying about how dangerous it is and and and it's not the flu
[3:01:55.240 --> 3:02:02.520]  the pathogen it's what else they're adding folks it's the vaccine that's bad also del tried to
[3:02:02.520 --> 3:02:10.280]  create del children's hospital tried to create the precedent of putting up these fear mongering
[3:02:10.280 --> 3:02:15.560]  tents where thousands of hypochondriacs per day at the peak in central texas were flooding in
[3:02:15.560 --> 3:02:21.720]  demanding the vaccine but now i heard them on the news last night on k lbj news report that only
[3:02:21.720 --> 3:02:27.640]  160 something i forget they got 168 i think that was 160 something are showing up a day
[3:02:27.640 --> 3:02:32.120]  so they're shutting down their little fema tent camps by the way remind douglas to go shoot that
[3:02:32.120 --> 3:02:37.320]  right now videotape that before they shut it down so i need to have that for stock footage
[3:02:37.320 --> 3:02:43.480]  to show that the of these this camp they set up over there so so they're failing there this is
[3:02:43.480 --> 3:02:52.200]  some really good news is it not paul watson it's good news yet and it shows why the establishment
[3:02:52.200 --> 3:02:58.840]  having to get really desperate in convincing the idiot public in their eyes to take this shot
[3:02:58.840 --> 3:03:06.360]  and as we've documented today they're even going to the levels of implanting propaganda in prime
[3:03:06.360 --> 3:03:11.960]  time network television shows and that's not an invention of paranoid conspiracy theories it was
[3:03:11.960 --> 3:03:20.040]  admitted last week and they bragged about it that all this week on the major network tv shows on abc
[3:03:20.040 --> 3:03:28.680]  fox cbs mbc the positive propaganda about obama's health care agenda and its servitude agenda are
[3:03:28.680 --> 3:03:35.800]  going to be implanted into sole poppers dramas comedy directly sending out the message the
[3:03:35.800 --> 3:03:41.080]  brainwashing that you know the government's going to take care of us now we've got a story
[3:03:41.080 --> 3:03:51.000]  where an abc show called flash forward has this piece where for for a few seconds it cuts to a
[3:03:51.000 --> 3:03:57.320]  shot of a computer screen which shows a fake website with a big ad in the middle that says
[3:03:57.320 --> 3:04:03.960]  time for your flu shot and then on the right hand side it says take it now and this is overlayed
[3:04:03.960 --> 3:04:11.000]  over the cleavage of a woman who sat there to make everybody look at it and it's blatant propaganda
[3:04:11.000 --> 3:04:17.080]  in the middle of this abc drama show to get people to take this line flu shot and it's
[3:04:17.080 --> 3:04:27.000]  desperation absolutely i mean it's just when i rarely watch tv or my wife does when she's
[3:04:27.000 --> 3:04:34.360]  on the treadmill or whatever you know she she downloads stuff off uh itunes the tv she says
[3:04:34.360 --> 3:04:41.000]  almost every show she watches is pro euthanasia pro vaccine pro abortion there's too many people
[3:04:41.000 --> 3:04:45.640]  babies have too big a carbon footprint and then the government admits oh yes the government's
[3:04:45.640 --> 3:04:51.800]  paying for all this on tv our tax money to produce these tv shows to brainwash people this i mean
[3:04:51.800 --> 3:04:56.280]  we're going into total tyranny wepster tarpley's coming up we'll talk about the iran situation

[3:10:55.560 --> 3:11:01.160]  up about that the point is let us now go to paul watson paul give us your quick take on what's
[3:11:01.160 --> 3:11:07.560]  happening in iran this is a bold move to publicly staged terror attacks all over iran and publicly
[3:11:07.560 --> 3:11:15.000]  brag about it while the west calls themselves peaceniks the non-nuclear iran uh is being set
[3:11:15.000 --> 3:11:21.240]  up here if they defend themselves they will tell the public uh that they've attacked us they could
[3:11:21.240 --> 3:11:27.960]  show brazil on the tv news and say it was iran people would believe it uh what's happening
[3:11:27.960 --> 3:11:36.920]  well alex on sunday there was a suicide bomb attack against the iran revolutionary guard at
[3:11:36.920 --> 3:11:42.760]  their headquarters in a place called pshin if i'm not saying that right which is near the border
[3:11:42.760 --> 3:11:51.800]  with pakistan and it was carried out admittedly they took the blame for it by this um sunni terrorist
[3:11:51.800 --> 3:11:59.800]  group known as jung duller which was formally headed by the alleged 911 mastermind the patsey
[3:11:59.800 --> 3:12:09.880]  khalid shake mohammed now the press reacted to this terrorist attack um by kind of swinging between
[3:12:09.880 --> 3:12:18.040]  iranian accusations and blanket denials on behalf of the u.s and britain that it was a terrorist
[3:12:18.040 --> 3:12:25.000]  attack launched by the u.s and the british against the iranians by proxy because the jung
[3:12:25.000 --> 3:12:31.800]  duller organization admittedly and this was reported by the london telegraph a bc news amongst
[3:12:31.800 --> 3:12:41.320]  many others in 2007 is armed and trained by the cia and moscow it's not even up for debate and
[3:12:41.320 --> 3:12:47.640]  that's what i found incredible about this you know this the reports about the accusations
[3:12:47.640 --> 3:12:54.520]  it's not even up for debate is confirmed this is a al-qaeda offshoot organization or the
[3:12:55.000 --> 3:13:01.480]  cia arab legion as webs to call it and it's controlled by the cia and they're using it to
[3:13:01.480 --> 3:13:07.080]  destabilize the iranian government by carrying out terrorist attacks against and by the way
[3:13:07.080 --> 3:13:13.560]  revolutionary guard by the way it is not just times of london or a bc news reported this in
[3:13:13.560 --> 3:13:22.920]  2007 sci-hersh webs retarply myself countless others have reported this in 2003 2004 2005
[3:13:24.360 --> 3:13:31.800]  in 2007 the white house dot gov the white house website put a press release out saying we're
[3:13:31.800 --> 3:13:36.760]  funding these four groups the states of tax and they didn't even debate that number three al-qaeda
[3:13:36.760 --> 3:13:44.120]  ran it al-qaeda publicly works for our criminal government i mean it it's just like the new
[3:13:44.120 --> 3:13:49.880]  york time saying there's no mercury in the flu shot when all their inserts say it an fda.gov says
[3:13:49.880 --> 3:13:56.680]  it it's just a new level of lying final comments we're going to webster tarbley yeah the other
[3:13:56.680 --> 3:14:02.440]  the other thing is that when members of this group were arrested by pakistan last year and handed
[3:14:02.440 --> 3:14:09.480]  over to iran the one of the top leaders of the jundala group admitted in court that they were
[3:14:09.480 --> 3:14:14.920]  being trained and on by the u.s. and israel and this was the brother of the leader of the group
[3:14:15.480 --> 3:14:20.840]  abdolomal at kreeki and his brother admitted that they were being trained by the u.s. it's
[3:14:20.840 --> 3:14:27.720]  admitted by the white house itself is being reported widely and yet it's still debatable
[3:14:27.720 --> 3:14:33.480]  whether the u.s. and britain and israel is behind this attack they're obviously behind the attack
[3:14:33.480 --> 3:14:40.040]  it took out one of the key men in the iranian revolutionary god who was the instrumental
[3:14:40.040 --> 3:14:45.640]  in calming the tensions in that region they targeted him for elimination and he's dead
[3:14:45.640 --> 3:14:50.680]  so if there's no debate who's behind it and it just goes and then meanwhile they get up on the
[3:14:50.680 --> 3:14:58.840]  news and say iran is running al-qaeda and taliban the sunni group the arch enemies of shia shiai
[3:14:58.840 --> 3:15:04.680]  iran this is like saying the dallas cowboys of the washington redskins or superman is lex luther
[3:15:04.680 --> 3:15:12.520]  i mean it's just or hitler uh is is is is franklin roosevelt i mean it's a total flipping and iran
[3:15:12.520 --> 3:15:18.520]  is fighting al-qaeda saying it's globalist run us british israeli run it's on record
[3:15:18.520 --> 3:15:24.120]  tell folks the headline on the great article you wrote a few days ago so people can go read the
[3:15:24.120 --> 3:15:31.560]  details and see all those links the al-qaeda u.s. attack iran via cia funded jundula terror group
[3:15:32.440 --> 3:15:36.760]  all right good job watson keep it up i look forward to the launch of all the republic
[3:15:36.760 --> 3:15:42.760]  at prison planet dot tv that you're haunt showing with matt and kevin and others here at the office
[3:15:42.760 --> 3:15:49.080]  in t minus 44 minutes thank you so much thanks alex okay webster i'm gonna let you take it out to
[3:15:49.080 --> 3:15:52.760]  break in five minutes i've actually got to go work on it stuff and give some orders here
[3:15:53.320 --> 3:15:57.400]  take us to break with the jundala situation and we'll come back finish up with that
[3:15:57.400 --> 3:16:01.000]  then get into the economics the banking meltdown you predicted a decade ago
[3:16:01.880 --> 3:16:06.520]  webster tarpily good to have you here with us thank you very much alex uh let me uh
[3:16:06.520 --> 3:16:10.840]  let me address this uh this terror attack since that that's our our leading issue at the moment
[3:16:10.840 --> 3:16:19.960]  this was a suicide bomb in the uh province of balochistan that is to say in the southeast
[3:16:19.960 --> 3:16:28.200]  of iran near the border with pakistan and uh it was claimed by this jundala organization which
[3:16:28.200 --> 3:16:35.400]  is simply a cia mi6 secret army it's a well-known front now this was a very serious bombing attack
[3:16:35.400 --> 3:16:42.520]  it was a an assembly of local and regional notables as well as some representatives from tehran
[3:16:43.160 --> 3:16:47.960]  it was a kind of a ceremonial occasion and it killed about 30 people according to some
[3:16:47.960 --> 3:16:54.040]  accounts and up to 60 people according to others and one of the people killed was the ground forces
[3:16:54.040 --> 3:17:01.560]  commander of the iranian pasturan revolutionary guard as well as the commander of the revolutionary
[3:17:01.560 --> 3:17:10.920]  guard or pasturan in that uh southeastern corner of iran now this jundala has been around for quite
[3:17:10.920 --> 3:17:16.120]  a while and and the iranians know it well so the iranian government immediately blamed the british
[3:17:16.840 --> 3:17:22.440]  as well as the u.s and the state department spokesman here in washington came out and said oh no
[3:17:22.440 --> 3:17:27.640]  we have nothing to do with that now it's absolutely absurd as alex points out because
[3:17:27.640 --> 3:17:33.800]  it's uh it's an absolute open secret that the u.s uh runs this i would say the british probably
[3:17:33.800 --> 3:17:38.520]  created it uh and continue to have significant influence but the money seems to be coming from
[3:17:38.520 --> 3:17:44.040]  the u.s and the targeting probably shared between washington and london just a a couple of these
[3:17:44.040 --> 3:17:51.000]  mainstream things in a little bit more detail back in february 2007 we have the london daily
[3:17:51.000 --> 3:17:59.080]  telegraph notoriously close to nato intelligence they quote a former high-ranking cia official
[3:17:59.080 --> 3:18:06.440]  saying that it's not a great secret that jundala gets its money from the cia classified budget that
[3:18:06.440 --> 3:18:13.720]  was uh 2007 they also have a guy called fred burton a former united states state department
[3:18:13.720 --> 3:18:19.800]  counterterrorism official who says that these attacks that were taking place already then
[3:18:19.800 --> 3:18:27.640]  in 2007 are part of u.s efforts to supply and train iran's ethnic minorities to destabilize
[3:18:27.640 --> 3:18:34.920]  the regime if that's not enough we have brian ross abc television news so you can see this on on
[3:18:34.920 --> 3:18:45.080]  tv for free uh april 2007 uh the u.s is encouraging and advising jundala and it's been run by the
[3:18:45.080 --> 3:18:51.560]  u.s essentially out of bases inside pakistan but really not not something you can blame on pakistan
[3:18:51.560 --> 3:18:56.680]  when the u.s and indeed the british are playing such an important role and then we have seymour
[3:18:56.680 --> 3:19:03.320]  hersh these are the famous articles that he wrote in the new yorker during those years um and seymour
[3:19:03.320 --> 3:19:12.680]  hersh gets uh gets a hold of robert bear the former cia official of uh clandestine services
[3:19:12.680 --> 3:19:20.040]  and he says that this is uh the u.s paying for this the u.s is working now with suny fundamentalist
[3:19:20.040 --> 3:19:28.280]  that's the trick with jundala jundala are suny um terrorist of the uh salafi persuasion and the
[3:19:28.280 --> 3:19:35.480]  idea is to set up a a conflict which is ethnic as well as religious uh with the uh them being
[3:19:35.480 --> 3:19:40.280]  against the persian Shiites are running a government in terrarium breaking it down and
[3:19:40.280 --> 3:19:45.480]  from when i've read there's four different groups some are wahabi is connected others suny
[3:19:45.480 --> 3:19:52.280]  break down all these groups for us and what i ran they do i mean imagine constant bombings
[3:19:52.280 --> 3:19:59.560]  blowing up government buildings blowing up their military blowing up their police it's just insane

[3:24:33.640 --> 3:24:39.000]  give the globalists a run for their money webster continuing along the line of these
[3:24:39.560 --> 3:24:47.480]  stage terror attacks using proxies from the west against the iranians openly trying to go them a
[3:24:47.480 --> 3:24:54.440]  type of false flag to start responding just like they had snuck attack russia on 888 and said russia
[3:24:54.440 --> 3:24:59.560]  did it in a week later it came out it was all alive but they don't care they just have disdain
[3:24:59.560 --> 3:25:05.000]  and contempt for the public that can't some of them i guess find their butt with both hands
[3:25:06.040 --> 3:25:11.320]  but uh where is this going what's the reason for this well one one other feature of belutius
[3:25:11.320 --> 3:25:16.200]  down that's important is that that's we have this very important city of guadal this key strategic
[3:25:16.200 --> 3:25:22.280]  port it's estimated that 40 percent of the oil tankers in the world go past the port of guadal
[3:25:22.280 --> 3:25:27.960]  and the uh the plan has always been to make an oil tanker terminal at guadal so that if you're
[3:25:27.960 --> 3:25:34.840]  coming out of kuwait or saudi arabia with a tanker load of oil you put that into a pipeline that
[3:25:34.840 --> 3:25:41.960]  would go up through pakistan and uh that would that would then get you into china so the chinese
[3:25:41.960 --> 3:25:46.600]  would would have a guaranteed source of oil you look at belutius down belutius down cuts into
[3:25:46.600 --> 3:25:52.680]  afghanistan the southern part of that it gives you a big chunk of pakistan and it gives you a
[3:25:52.680 --> 3:25:58.520]  significant part of iran so this is one of the microstates and mini states that big new brzezinski
[3:25:58.520 --> 3:26:03.560]  writes about in his books and which are the the goal of the obama administration places like
[3:26:03.560 --> 3:26:09.080]  push tunas done that would cut into pakistan and afghanistan so this has brzezinski geopolitical
[3:26:09.080 --> 3:26:14.360]  designs written all over absolutely and it's only part of a pattern uh inside iran there were four
[3:26:14.360 --> 3:26:20.040]  or five of these ethnic groups you got the belutius you've got a significant arab minority along the
[3:26:20.040 --> 3:26:27.400]  gulf and that's where you've got your tanker terminal at karg island and your uh uh uh the uh
[3:26:27.400 --> 3:26:33.480]  abaddon refinery one of the largest in the world there's also a Kurdish minority that the cia has
[3:26:33.480 --> 3:26:39.400]  been playing out of iraq there's an azeri minority coming from the door to where they want to knock
[3:26:39.400 --> 3:26:44.440]  out the police intelligence bureau there so they can move more terror forces and to further
[3:26:44.440 --> 3:26:49.960]  destabilize the area right and you've also got then this green revolution you've got the cia
[3:26:49.960 --> 3:26:55.000]  coup faction right the rich and leaders and desperate housewives of north tehran with their
[3:26:55.000 --> 3:27:01.400]  leaders musavi and raps on johnny and they run around chanting death to russia death to china
[3:27:01.400 --> 3:27:06.120]  that couldn't be any clearer if they see his power they'd cut off the oil to china and make
[3:27:06.120 --> 3:27:12.600]  trouble for russia so this explains why akhmedinijad is looking more and more like a traditional
[3:27:12.600 --> 3:27:18.680]  military dictator leaning primarily on russia and the u.s is interestingly enough on the side of the
[3:27:18.680 --> 3:27:24.600]  mullahs of the most benighted sort when you get into this situation in in tehran so the idea is to
[3:27:24.600 --> 3:27:31.080]  is to tear iran apart from several points of view i do not think that there will be a a huge
[3:27:31.080 --> 3:27:36.440]  bombing raid on iran there are acts of war going on this this was one of them and these have been
[3:27:36.440 --> 3:27:42.360]  going on in these peripheral ethnic areas for quite a while at the end of it the persians themselves
[3:27:42.360 --> 3:27:49.000]  would be left in a almost landlocked internal part of the country iranistan with very little oil
[3:27:49.000 --> 3:27:55.080]  and uh... and very little uh... perspective so that will be this question webster then what's the
[3:27:55.080 --> 3:28:02.040]  main strategic reason for this are they trying to get the iranians to launch attacks is their truth
[3:28:02.040 --> 3:28:07.400]  to the western headlines that republic that the guard heads the generals are saying we will
[3:28:07.400 --> 3:28:12.280]  we will counter strike or or is that lies well certainly they're going to retaliate if if there
[3:28:12.280 --> 3:28:17.080]  were a huge bombing raid on uh... on iran and their nuclear facilities naturally they retaliate
[3:28:17.080 --> 3:28:21.240]  with uh... with whatever they had they could probably cut the uh... the tanker traffic through
[3:28:21.240 --> 3:28:25.480]  but they're saying they're going to respond to this
[3:28:25.480 --> 3:28:30.360]  in this case though i think it'll be proportional and what that is i guess remains to be seen
[3:28:31.000 --> 3:28:36.520]  uh... the general idea though is to weaken iran and play iran against russia and china
[3:28:36.520 --> 3:28:41.800]  bridging his goal is not not to have the u s at war with iran what what's the point of that
[3:28:41.800 --> 3:28:46.680]  the point is to get iran if possible at either at war or locked in conflict
[3:28:46.680 --> 3:28:52.600]  with russia and china who are the main geopolitical enemies now that obama has come in and replace the
[3:28:52.600 --> 3:28:56.920]  neocons more or less what do you see happening in iran where's this going
[3:28:58.040 --> 3:29:02.520]  i think the green crew has failed i think it'll take a while for the uh...
[3:29:03.080 --> 3:29:07.560]  for the cia and company to figure that out but the attempt to overthrow the government
[3:29:07.560 --> 3:29:11.320]  is failing and i do think i've been in a job will evolve more and more
[3:29:11.320 --> 3:29:16.280]  towards a rather traditional military dictatorship he's a military man
[3:29:16.280 --> 3:29:21.240]  and i imagine they'll be able to deal with these uh... peripheral terrorist uh... in the uh...
[3:29:21.240 --> 3:29:24.760]  relatively uh... brutal way that uh... would be would be usual
[3:29:25.720 --> 3:29:29.800]  the savoc methods i suppose yes the savoc savama savoc
[3:29:31.400 --> 3:29:34.760]  all right webster tartly stay there i want to shift gears out of this
[3:29:34.760 --> 3:29:37.560]  into the economy in the plunging dollar
[3:29:38.840 --> 3:29:41.560]  different countries saying they want a debt moratorium
[3:29:41.560 --> 3:29:47.080]  we'll talk about it all we're now thirty minutes and fifteen seconds away from the release
[3:29:47.080 --> 3:29:50.040]  of fall of the republic we're trying to save the republic
[3:29:51.800 --> 3:29:58.520]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gc n radio network
[3:30:01.080 --> 3:30:05.640]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[3:30:05.640 --> 3:30:09.960]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[3:30:09.960 --> 3:30:15.000]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[3:30:15.000 --> 3:30:20.600]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[3:30:20.600 --> 3:30:25.720]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[3:30:25.720 --> 3:30:31.000]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[3:30:31.000 --> 3:30:35.480]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power
[3:30:35.480 --> 3:30:40.840]  from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance
[3:30:40.840 --> 3:30:44.920]  and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[3:30:44.920 --> 3:30:51.000]  science one of my old sponsors you can get more information at www dot my solar backup dot com

[3:35:53.320 --> 3:35:58.840]  that obama deception is devastating i mean they're actually usually just call you a kook and a nut
[3:35:58.840 --> 3:36:04.920]  they're saying i'm this great danger then it came out in the globe that there is a enemy's list and
[3:36:04.920 --> 3:36:13.960]  of 25 people i am number 24 now that hit list kind of kind of comes out with the left right
[3:36:13.960 --> 3:36:20.920]  paradigm angle but then meanwhile this was first on the news yesterday then he gave a speech today
[3:36:20.920 --> 3:36:25.800]  on the senate floor alexander the white house don't create enemies list and lemar alexander
[3:36:25.800 --> 3:36:31.480]  the senator of tennessee he says look i worked for nixon the enemy's list the dirty tricks
[3:36:31.480 --> 3:36:39.160]  don't do it he says he's confirmed internally that the operation is in full swing uh just all

[3:39:25.640 --> 3:39:33.480]  of the booting process uh going back to you i was talking about how lamar lamar smith the
[3:39:33.480 --> 3:39:38.360]  senator has gone to the floor today to say please don't have the enemies list he says he's confirmed
[3:39:38.360 --> 3:39:43.400]  there's one it's come out mainstream news not just tabloids now that they are targeting their enemies
[3:39:43.400 --> 3:39:48.520]  i am one of the people chiefly and they mentioned the obama deception that film really hit a
[3:39:48.520 --> 3:39:52.680]  nerve with them and then i want to get into what's happening with the dollar but you're a big part of
[3:39:52.680 --> 3:39:58.920]  the obama deception now you're an even bigger part of all the republic and this nexus isn't
[3:39:58.920 --> 3:40:05.080]  dovetails into the fact that the truth is really damaging to these this people and this is the fact
[3:40:05.080 --> 3:40:10.360]  that we're drawing blood on this criminal regime in the info war this should be a cry of victory
[3:40:10.360 --> 3:40:15.640]  for us to know that we can we can drive these guys to ground your take on the enemy's list
[3:40:15.640 --> 3:40:19.560]  well i'm sure they have an enemy's list they have more than that i think they actually have
[3:40:19.560 --> 3:40:24.760]  departments in the white house there was a report coming from some people in canada who had figured
[3:40:24.760 --> 3:40:29.240]  out that there was a there was a special department of the white house which dealt with the birth
[3:40:29.240 --> 3:40:35.080]  certificate issue raised by phil berg and others uh and that was all it did and i'm sure there's
[3:40:35.080 --> 3:40:40.120]  another one there for the larry sinclair issues and and everything that goes with the news says
[3:40:40.120 --> 3:40:44.920]  and i want to make a correction in erupting it's lamar alexander i lamar smith i get names turned
[3:40:44.920 --> 3:40:50.040]  around senator lamar alexander go ahead so they do have an enemy's list now uh in terms of the
[3:40:50.040 --> 3:40:55.320]  obama deception and now the fall of the republic the obama deception in many ways is the uh
[3:40:55.320 --> 3:41:02.360]  the preparation for breaking the spell for dispelling the magic for bringing obama down to
[3:41:02.360 --> 3:41:07.960]  earth uh i guess it must have come out in uh in may right and then during the summer it had a
[3:41:07.960 --> 3:41:13.720]  tremendous impact and what you saw then in june july august in terms of a populist rebellion
[3:41:13.720 --> 3:41:19.960]  and of leftists and rightists against obama because it was both you had old people who said
[3:41:19.960 --> 3:41:25.080]  i want my medicare that's my medicare from the new deal in the great society and you take your
[3:41:25.080 --> 3:41:29.400]  hands off it obama because you want to give the money to wall street what he really does so
[3:41:30.440 --> 3:41:35.560]  a broad consensus around that now the question is now with the fall of the republic my ambition
[3:41:35.560 --> 3:41:41.480]  for the fall of the republic is this should lead to gridlock in washington we have two parties
[3:41:41.480 --> 3:41:47.080]  of scoundrels and incompetent they're corrupt they're stupid uh and they have all of these
[3:41:47.720 --> 3:41:52.440]  plans that that we've been documenting uh the only possible perspective right now
[3:41:52.440 --> 3:41:57.640]  is we want gridlock we don't want any changes i don't want the changes obama wants and i don't
[3:41:57.640 --> 3:42:02.520]  want the changes the republicans want so let's have gridlock let's have these institutions
[3:42:02.520 --> 3:42:07.240]  be paralyzed uh for the mall let me ask you webster what should i be doing because i really
[3:42:07.240 --> 3:42:13.480]  respect your perspective what should i be doing being on the top 25 enemies list of the white
[3:42:13.480 --> 3:42:19.000]  house i mean that's pretty creepy well that's uh that's a badge of honor of course congratulations
[3:42:19.720 --> 3:42:25.720]  that's excellent uh again the main thing i think is is to is to get into this idea the obama
[3:42:25.720 --> 3:42:32.200]  health care reform is a monstrosity however there's a grave danger that obama and the republicans
[3:42:32.200 --> 3:42:38.600]  could make a deal the one thing they could agree on is they could say let's destroy medicare let's
[3:42:38.600 --> 3:42:44.040]  take 500 billion out of medicare let's strip the american people of their economic rights
[3:42:44.040 --> 3:42:49.400]  let's also destroy medicaid in the process and this is this is something that some republicans
[3:42:49.400 --> 3:42:55.080]  have said that they could see common ground with obama when it comes to to uh stripping away the
[3:42:55.080 --> 3:42:58.680]  economic right let me add this american people let me add this we're gonna get into the dollar
[3:42:58.680 --> 3:43:02.200]  because you're absolutely right when i was in the airport last wednesday and bought this wall
[3:43:02.200 --> 3:43:08.120]  street journal i'm showing people on tv wednesday october 14th headline insurers stand against
[3:43:08.120 --> 3:43:18.760]  obama committees plan excuse me and then in the article they have the spokesman for the health
[3:43:18.760 --> 3:43:26.920]  care insurance lobby it says he's the head guy who speaks for them you know i guess from the papal
[3:43:26.920 --> 3:43:33.480]  seat or however you put it and and and he's there speaking for them and he says we wrote this bill
[3:43:34.200 --> 3:43:40.120]  we wrote the takeover of health care and we want bigger fines if you don't come get our insurance
[3:43:40.120 --> 3:43:45.240]  we want liability protection so they can basically get get more money make you get their insurance
[3:43:45.240 --> 3:43:50.680]  then lower the care everything you said six months ago but then when you watch the mainstream news
[3:43:50.680 --> 3:43:54.840]  the the controlled left acts like oh insurance companies who are greedy and bad which they are
[3:43:54.840 --> 3:44:00.200]  greedy and bad many cases they don't want this bill when they wrote it now because of pressure
[3:44:00.200 --> 3:44:06.040]  stripping the the the the fine if you don't get it and and and and stripping a lot of this corporate
[3:44:06.040 --> 3:44:12.040]  welfare now they're threatening to back out of what they wrote so every time these fake george
[3:44:12.040 --> 3:44:19.000]  soros leftist who just want a new tax on health care to pay to the banks every time they get uh
[3:44:19.000 --> 3:44:24.440]  yeah cornered they come out and say oh people that don't want this government health care plan
[3:44:24.440 --> 3:44:29.320]  you know they are working for the health care industry it's the big health care fat cats that
[3:44:29.320 --> 3:44:34.040]  are behind this webster there's also this question about what they call the the mandate in other
[3:44:34.040 --> 3:44:40.840]  words that every individual is forced to buy insurance from a for-profit private health care
[3:44:40.840 --> 3:44:46.920]  company which is what it's going to be it's a for-profit deregulated company with 33 percent
[3:44:46.920 --> 3:44:53.240]  overhead with the executive perks golden parachutes lobbying budget advertising budget the interesting
[3:44:53.240 --> 3:44:58.600]  question is how can that be constitutional how can the u.s. government coerce anybody
[3:44:58.600 --> 3:45:04.120]  into buying something from a private company um when they they usually say well you get
[3:45:04.680 --> 3:45:10.280]  insurance for your uh for your car fine an automobile uh you can get a driver's license
[3:45:10.280 --> 3:45:15.320]  without insurance it's do you want to put a car on the road then many states require
[3:45:15.320 --> 3:45:20.360]  liability insurance this is not the same thing what what obama's basically saying is just because
[3:45:20.360 --> 3:45:25.400]  you're there because you're alive and breathing in the united states you're going to be forced to
[3:45:25.400 --> 3:45:32.920]  go to well point and blue cross and give them what uh 13 15 percent of your income i don't see how
[3:45:32.920 --> 3:45:37.640]  that can be done constitutionally i think there's a real constitutional barrier to that because
[3:45:37.640 --> 3:45:41.720]  otherwise i'm being forced to buy something from a private company this makes no sense
[3:45:41.720 --> 3:45:50.520]  absolutely okay so whether it comes from republicans or democrats either way it's special interest
[3:45:50.520 --> 3:45:56.920]  trying to loot people because the system is so corrupt any way you slice it they're involved
[3:45:56.920 --> 3:46:00.680]  in a fraud we'll have you back up soon to talk about that let's shift gears in the time we have
[3:46:00.680 --> 3:46:06.920]  left webster the global economic crises that over 10 years ago you wrote your your your your your
[3:46:06.920 --> 3:46:12.280]  economic tone on we actually sell the latest edition of that info wars dot com for people
[3:46:12.280 --> 3:46:16.520]  that are interested in surviving economic cataclysm it's happening just as you broke it down
[3:46:17.240 --> 3:46:22.200]  what are we dealing with open g 20 announcing world government carbon taxes will pay to them
[3:46:23.160 --> 3:46:28.520]  just just a planetary dictatorship run by a bunch of made-off kin lay types where do you
[3:46:28.520 --> 3:46:33.560]  see all this going well i hope very much that this Copenhagen conference which they they want to
[3:46:33.560 --> 3:46:40.120]  they want to impose this yoke they want to crucify humanity on a cross of carbon in Copenhagen in
[3:46:40.120 --> 3:46:44.360]  in december i hope that's going to be a failure and there's some pretty powerful forces that are
[3:46:44.360 --> 3:46:49.800]  that are making it a failure china and india have had joint meetings where they say we will
[3:46:49.800 --> 3:46:55.320]  not be bound by this insanity we will not be stifled and strangled and and frustrated in
[3:46:55.320 --> 3:46:59.880]  our economic development because a bunch of rich elitists in london and new york decide
[3:46:59.880 --> 3:47:05.720]  that they have some carbon phobia carbon fetish whatever it is so i think there's a very good
[3:47:05.720 --> 3:47:11.000]  chance that the Copenhagen conference will blow up there will be a monumental failure i urge
[3:47:11.000 --> 3:47:15.400]  everybody to do everything in their power especially around the world make sure that that
[3:47:15.400 --> 3:47:21.800]  Copenhagen conference is a failure again gridlock we want gridlock that's the only possible outcome
[3:47:21.800 --> 3:47:26.600]  that that saves humanity under these conditions now the other thing is that the dollar crisis
[3:47:26.600 --> 3:47:32.440]  that you mentioned today the dollar is um is very weak it's a dollar fifty it's more than a dollar
[3:47:32.440 --> 3:47:38.120]  fifty to buy a euro that is very close to an all-time low and it's certainly a 14 month low
[3:47:38.120 --> 3:47:45.160]  the dollar index is below 75 which is quite dramatic and at the same time this is the the
[3:47:45.160 --> 3:47:51.240]  kind of thing that gets you into the geometry of hyperinflation you've got oil is up to almost
[3:47:51.240 --> 3:47:57.160]  82 dollars a barrel so oil has gone up well certainly more than 10 percent just in the last
[3:47:58.040 --> 3:48:03.640]  five or six days so uh i think what you're heading for now is some kind of a dramatic
[3:48:03.640 --> 3:48:10.360]  moment uh hyperinflation takes off slowly and then it gathers steam and i'm afraid we're now in
[3:48:10.360 --> 3:48:15.800]  that kind of an area one thing that i would warn against the british uh remember that when you get
[3:48:15.800 --> 3:48:22.200]  a situation now of latent crisis the crisis that it's about to explode the british specialty
[3:48:22.200 --> 3:48:28.200]  is to try to precipitate the crisis to to to break it out in the open in such a way that they can
[3:48:28.200 --> 3:48:34.280]  export the depression to others to to the u.s to europe to japan whatever they can do this robert
[3:48:34.280 --> 3:48:41.480]  fisk article in the london independent has been uh i think characterized by the ria novosti news
[3:48:41.480 --> 3:48:49.080]  agency as a plant by george soros designed to create a dollar panic and to prevent any uh
[3:48:49.080 --> 3:48:55.560]  rational form of monetary reform it's just what the british do they did it in 1931 when they went
[3:48:55.560 --> 3:49:01.560]  off gold they did it in 1971 when they brought down brettan wood they did it in 2007 2008
[3:49:01.560 --> 3:49:06.680]  they're trying to they're trying to extort six billion dollars from i so this does signify
[3:49:06.680 --> 3:49:13.000]  that the angle american power elite are wanting to cause a global currency crisis now for a massive
[3:49:13.000 --> 3:49:18.200]  change yeah some of them are uh again the the more british side and the wall street side but
[3:49:18.200 --> 3:49:23.240]  they may they may indeed be counter countervailing forces on that too so look at the article by
[3:49:23.240 --> 3:49:29.400]  vlad grinkovich on ria novosti attacking robert fisk as essentially somebody who's a speaking tube
[3:49:29.400 --> 3:49:35.960]  for george soros obviously it is impossible for the dollar to remain as the sole reserve currency
[3:49:35.960 --> 3:49:42.760]  that will not work on the other hand most of the other candidates for this are even less qualified
[3:49:42.760 --> 3:49:48.280]  the euro in the end i think are even less able to do this job than the dollar and the worst of all
[3:49:48.280 --> 3:49:53.880]  possible worlds is this idea of a synthetic currency uh the idea that you create a super
[3:49:53.880 --> 3:49:58.920]  national currency it would probably turn out to be special drawing rights of the international
[3:49:58.920 --> 3:50:05.160]  monetary fund that's the worst that is what lord canes wanted at brettan woods lord canes of course
[3:50:05.160 --> 3:50:10.600]  spokesman for british imperialism he wanted this thing called bankor which would have been a
[3:50:11.640 --> 3:50:17.240]  just a strangulation of world development instead of brettan woods that brettan woods worked very
[3:50:17.240 --> 3:50:25.160]  very well between 1944 1941 1971 we had the best rates of economic development in world history
[3:50:25.160 --> 3:50:29.960]  before or since we should i think go back to the the positive features of brettan woods not all of
[3:50:29.960 --> 3:50:36.040]  them but the ones that that proved to work well but certainly no bankor no special drawing rights
[3:50:36.040 --> 3:50:41.560]  no super national currency and above all watch out for british sabotage as this crisis gets worse
[3:50:42.600 --> 3:50:47.000]  all right i want to talk about how you see this unfolding on the current course that the establishment
[3:50:47.000 --> 3:50:52.200]  has us on what some of those different forces that are moving towards world government and
[3:50:52.200 --> 3:50:56.920]  vertical integration but maybe debating about who's going to be on top of pyramid when this all
[3:50:56.920 --> 3:51:01.080]  settles we'll talk about the final timeline and then launch follow the republic straight ahead

[3:56:22.360 --> 3:56:26.680]  get them out to everybody webster final comments about the state of the world where we're going
[3:56:27.640 --> 3:56:34.120]  well um we're headed into a very severe dollar crisis it probably has hyperinflationary overtones
[3:56:34.120 --> 3:56:39.880]  the problem that we have is the the uh the system has now reached the state of such fragility
[3:56:40.600 --> 3:56:45.320]  that there are very little reserves left to deal with such a crisis i mean look at the
[3:56:45.320 --> 3:56:50.360]  look at the federal reserve they're down to zero percent they can't go any lower and certainly the
[3:56:50.360 --> 3:56:55.720]  ability of the united states government to come up with another 700 billion to bail out banks
[3:56:55.720 --> 3:57:01.480]  uh is is not there so that that can't be done anymore um we're now at a point where we got this
[3:57:01.480 --> 3:57:09.560]  huge buildup of snow ready to form an avalanche and any kind of an event can can set it off
[3:57:09.560 --> 3:57:15.800]  it won't be gradual it will be uh a leap in other words it's going to be something quite dramatic
[3:57:15.800 --> 3:57:21.960]  once it starts going by the order of magnitude well huge bigger bigger than september of uh
[3:57:21.960 --> 3:57:28.200]  of 2008 in other words now it's a dollar crisis as well as an anglo-american banking crisis and
[3:57:28.200 --> 3:57:33.560]  indeed a world banking crisis because people should understand when the dollar goes down
[3:57:33.560 --> 3:57:40.200]  nobody remains uh invulnerable to that everybody is going to suffer greatly and that includes china
[3:57:40.200 --> 3:57:45.560]  india and everybody else just think of the chinese with their two trillion dollars worth of of u.s
[3:57:45.560 --> 3:57:50.920]  treasury bonds as well as their very foolish dependency on the u.s market for all of their
[3:57:51.960 --> 3:57:56.680]  low price exports this is this was not wise so we're going to see a lot of mistakes that get
[3:57:56.680 --> 3:58:02.520]  paid for for inside the u.s again i recommend gridlock uh fight the thing to a standstill
[3:58:02.520 --> 3:58:07.000]  and then we're going to need obviously an anti-depression program but there's nobody who
[3:58:07.000 --> 3:58:10.920]  represents that at the present time so we got to do more propaganda on that front
[3:58:14.360 --> 3:58:19.080]  well webster great job breaking that down for us today he's the author of two books on barack
