[00:41.920 --> 00:48.320]  today oh man we've got so much going on the North American Union has arrived the
[00:48.320 --> 00:55.160]  first official Mexican shipping truck is set to cross the US border shortly we've
[00:55.160 --> 01:01.840]  got so much news going on Ron Paul money bomb raises 2.75 million dollars to help
[01:01.840 --> 01:06.040]  his campaign there still the only guy that's got a plan still the only guy
[01:06.040 --> 01:11.320]  telling the truth still the only guy that respects the Constitution and the
[01:11.320 --> 01:15.600]  Bill of Rights which is of course why are they going after him tooth and nail
[01:15.600 --> 01:21.480]  oh now of course we've got Rick Perry saying let's scrap the tax code offering
[01:21.480 --> 01:30.440]  a 20% flat tax well I guess this whole flat tax idea this cane 999 idea is
[01:30.440 --> 01:34.960]  starting to become some kind of weird viral infection in the minds of the
[01:34.960 --> 01:41.360]  other candidates now Perry saying let's go for a 20% flat tax of course what they
[01:41.360 --> 01:45.360]  don't tell you is that they're going to keep all the other taxes too on top of
[01:45.360 --> 01:50.480]  that they're not going to roll out the flat tax in place of the other taxes but
[01:50.480 --> 01:55.560]  rather on top of everything else that's the scam remember the the income tax
[01:55.560 --> 02:02.080]  started out as a 1% tax on the top 1% and now it's what I don't know the average
[02:02.080 --> 02:06.080]  American worker that's making a middle-class wage is paying what two
[02:06.080 --> 02:10.200]  thirds of their income in taxes of one kind or another sales taxes property

[02:32.320 --> 02:37.320]  American children in these medical experiments and they can't figure it out
[02:37.320 --> 02:41.480]  and they have a bunch of bioethicists in a committee who are trying to advise them
[02:41.480 --> 02:46.280]  to say gee should we should we inject these little kids with anthrax vaccines
[02:46.280 --> 02:52.600]  or should we just wait until they get infected with vaccine with with anthrax
[02:52.600 --> 02:57.280]  through some kind of bioterrorism attack of course and who will launch the
[02:57.280 --> 03:01.880]  bioterrorism attack it's our own insiders probably very very own

[08:42.040 --> 08:46.480]  out and I can't wait to see what's going to be censored because some of those
[08:46.480 --> 08:49.200]  episodes they don't really want on the air and we're going to go through some
[08:49.200 --> 08:54.040]  of the breaking news here today and we've got some great guests coming up it
[08:54.040 --> 09:00.040]  is October 25th by the way I should have said that right there at the intro we've
[09:00.040 --> 09:04.200]  got just an action-packed show for you lots of information about we've got an
[09:04.200 --> 09:07.520]  insider from the pharmaceutical industry the author of a book called

[09:13.160 --> 09:16.960]  joining us here in studio at the bottom of this hour kind of reminds me of John
[09:16.960 --> 09:22.600]  Perkins you know Confessions of an Economic Hitman what a great guy and a
[09:22.600 --> 09:26.120]  great interview John Perkins has been on this show many times of course so we
[09:26.120 --> 09:29.200]  have kind of a similar type of thing here with Gwen Olson Confessions of a
[09:29.200 --> 09:34.280]  pharmaceutical drug pusher we've got Liz Rietzig coming up at the bottom of the
[09:34.280 --> 09:37.720]  next hour to talk about the raw milk Freedom Riders event taking place
[09:37.720 --> 09:45.480]  November 1 when a bunch of moms are going to be breaking the law by smuggling
[09:45.480 --> 09:49.960]  raw milk across state lines and consuming it in front of the FDA
[09:49.960 --> 09:54.400]  headquarters wow can you believe that that's that's pretty daring in this in
[09:54.400 --> 09:57.160]  this day and age there's such tear now I wonder if they're gonna get stopped by a
[09:57.160 --> 10:03.800]  TSA roadside checkpoint before they can even get there and the TSA will probably
[10:03.800 --> 10:08.960]  jump in their vans I don't know strip them down and say we're searching for
[10:08.960 --> 10:13.480]  milk you you never know what the TSA is gonna gonna try next then we've got
[10:13.480 --> 10:15.960]  Daniel Vitalis coming up at the bottom of the third hour to talk about
[10:15.960 --> 10:22.560]  preparedness and Occupy Wall Street the riots what I what I'm calling the the
[10:22.560 --> 10:26.120]  second American Revolution I mean I'm probably not the first one to use that
[10:26.120 --> 10:29.960]  phrase a lot of people are saying the second American Revolution is upon us
[10:29.960 --> 10:35.720]  or at least the beginning signs of it Occupy Wall Street could expand I just
[10:35.720 --> 10:38.760]  think the protests are going to expand we've got the bank failures happening in
[10:38.760 --> 10:42.480]  Europe and we've got some domestic news so I'm gonna read you some of these
[10:42.480 --> 10:49.920]  headlines with a few comments on this if you're watching on prisonplanet.tv we
[10:49.920 --> 10:55.000]  do have Gwynn Olson in studio coming up the next hour so so check us out there
[10:55.000 --> 11:00.480]  okay McDonald's boost profits despite the sluggish economy isn't that wonderful
[11:00.480 --> 11:06.280]  we have a wonderful economy in America now where if you work for a process
[11:06.280 --> 11:14.160]  factory made junk food company or the toxic cancer industry or a hospital or
[11:14.160 --> 11:20.800]  a pharmacy where you're pushing deadly drugs or antidepressants onto Americans
[11:20.800 --> 11:24.200]  now I think 11 or 12 percent of the population is on antidepressants well
[11:24.200 --> 11:28.800]  if you're working in any of those industries then you got a job yeah
[11:28.800 --> 11:33.520]  because the economy is really strong in all the industries of disease and death
[11:33.520 --> 11:40.000]  and war yeah that's right if you build missiles you got a job if you make
[11:40.000 --> 11:44.320]  processed food you got a job if you're working in the death industry also known
[11:44.320 --> 11:49.120]  as the healthcare system I should say the conventional healthcare system then
[11:49.120 --> 11:53.480]  you got a job and McDonald's is boosting profits boy I tell you what this
[11:53.480 --> 11:59.680]  economy is going to become McDonald's and Walmart and cancer centers and bomb
[11:59.680 --> 12:06.120]  making operations and nothing that really helps anybody anymore you know
[12:06.120 --> 12:10.760]  what what about the farmers out there who are trying to grow some hemp so that
[12:10.760 --> 12:14.440]  we can actually have some economic abundance in America with hemp seeds
[12:14.440 --> 12:17.960]  and hemp fibers and hemp clothing and hemp paper you can even make car
[12:17.960 --> 12:21.960]  bumpers out of hemp if you want I know a few people in Mexico who are actually
[12:21.960 --> 12:27.480]  trying to put some hemp into car bumpers as we speak but the point is we
[12:27.480 --> 12:32.200]  if you know all of the stuff that could help our economy is being outlawed right
[12:32.200 --> 12:39.160]  I mean the the dietary supplements that can help prevent disease outlawed raw
[12:39.160 --> 12:44.840]  milk from fresh from a farm in America outlawed suppressed I was talking to a
[12:44.840 --> 12:50.680]  rancher just yesterday last night actually they they have grass-fed free
[12:50.680 --> 12:56.280]  range beef that they sell and now the USDA is coming in and saying oh they're
[12:56.280 --> 13:00.680]  gonna have to label the fat content of every little cut of beef well every cut
[13:00.680 --> 13:04.880]  is different because they don't have a big multimillion dollar factory where
[13:04.880 --> 13:10.040]  they're combining 20,000 cows into a giant grinder so that you can sample it
[13:10.040 --> 13:14.040]  once and you can label you know 100,000 packages of beef with the same fat
[13:14.040 --> 13:19.120]  content no they actually cut the beef off the cow carcass piece by piece the way
[13:19.120 --> 13:22.640]  it used to be done you know where every cut is a little different because
[13:22.640 --> 13:26.360]  there's variation in nature but now they're going to have this extra burden
[13:26.360 --> 13:33.200]  thanks to thanks to government regulators it's just sad all right oh man
[13:33.200 --> 13:40.800]  TSA agent a blogger says the TSA agent found a vibrator in her luggage and left
[13:40.800 --> 13:46.080]  a note and you know I'm not going to go into any details on that one but the
[13:46.080 --> 13:51.020]  TSA is leaving notes now little cutesy notes in your luggage based on what they
[13:51.020 --> 13:57.200]  find there it's like a running commentary oh wow we how about hey we sure are
[13:57.200 --> 14:01.720]  enjoying your iPad that we stole from you and auctioned off on eBay that's the
[14:01.720 --> 14:06.160]  note they should leave or a next time you come through here bring some better
[14:06.160 --> 14:09.960]  electronic gadgets so we can steal those too that's what the TSA should be
[14:09.960 --> 14:15.080]  leaving in there and okay here's here's some interesting news we're man these
[14:15.080 --> 14:19.040]  headlines are driving me nuts this is actually from a couple years ago but I
[14:19.040 --> 14:23.440]  thought you need to know about this there's an RFID chip patent that an
[14:23.440 --> 14:28.520]  Arab individual filed for and it is a killer microchip patent so that the
[14:28.520 --> 14:36.760]  RFID chip can remotely be told to release a deadly dose of cyanide yeah if
[14:36.760 --> 14:41.720]  you thought tracking you was the problem with RFID chips just wait until they
[14:41.720 --> 14:48.240]  they click that terminate button oh you post a something something on on your
[14:48.240 --> 14:51.640]  blog that they don't want to hear terminate little release of cyanide for
[14:51.640 --> 14:59.640]  you there a Wisconsin town now wants to make walking and biking a crime this is
[14:59.640 --> 15:06.960]  true I'm not making this up this town says that bicyclists and pedestrians are
[15:06.960 --> 15:11.600]  such a nuisance you know these people how dare they walk how dare they ride
[15:11.600 --> 15:17.840]  their bikes such a nuisance on the town roads that this town of whole Wisconsin
[15:17.840 --> 15:23.720]  wants these people to register their travel plans in advance you got that
[15:23.720 --> 15:29.040]  register your travel plans in advance okay you're out walking around the
[15:29.040 --> 15:32.640]  street you're walking around the sidewalk maybe you're going to the store
[15:32.640 --> 15:36.760]  doing a little shopping hey maybe just catching a little sunshine or fresh air
[15:36.760 --> 15:43.080]  alongside the road there and a town maybe a police officer comes up to you
[15:43.080 --> 15:48.200]  says hey you're a nuisance to the traffic here did you register your travel
[15:48.200 --> 15:52.520]  plans in advance if you say no apparently you're going to be arrested
[15:52.520 --> 15:58.080]  see walking around is going to be illegal now it's not just you can't carry
[15:58.080 --> 16:02.920]  raw milk across state lines you can't drive down the highway without being
[16:02.920 --> 16:09.960]  inspected illegally by the TSA with all the drug sniffing dogs and now now they
[16:09.960 --> 16:14.200]  don't want you to be able to bicycle or even walk around the Occupy movement
[16:14.200 --> 16:18.360]  moving on to other news spins off something new this is interesting the
[16:18.360 --> 16:23.240]  Occupy Marines and the Occupy police now this is actually a really good sign

[17:09.680 --> 17:13.860]  going to take a left on Maine and if you veer from that plan you could be a
[17:13.860 --> 17:18.600]  criminal but anyway Occupy Marines a group of Marines who apparently realized
[17:18.600 --> 17:22.440]  that hey they got a fight for something that makes sense and good for them good
[17:22.440 --> 17:26.440]  for them fight for liberty fight for protection of the Bill of Rights fight
[17:26.440 --> 17:31.720]  for free speech rights in America today how we doing here all right good a lot
[17:31.720 --> 17:36.960]  more news to cover Wall Street protest plans a global rally before the G20
[17:36.960 --> 17:42.680]  summit coming up that's some more news we oh by the way we've got coming up the
[17:42.680 --> 17:45.880]  study of the anthrax vaccine that we mentioned previously we're going to get
[17:45.880 --> 17:49.880]  more into that at the top of the next hour they want to use American children
[17:49.880 --> 17:54.640]  as experimental little guinea pigs or their little anthrax vaccine tests oh
[17:54.640 --> 18:00.200]  yes the the history of the experimental use of children not just children in
[18:00.200 --> 18:05.440]  Nigeria which of course that's that's a legendary part of medical history not
[18:05.440 --> 18:09.520]  just the prisoners in Guatemala no but American children they want to inject
[18:09.520 --> 18:14.400]  them with anthrax vaccines I guess it's their little patriotic duty mm-hmm yep
[18:14.400 --> 18:18.480]  just be injected let's see if you live see it see if you live and then they'll
[18:18.480 --> 18:21.640]  say it's approved for everybody else that's how the vaccine industry works
[18:21.640 --> 18:27.040]  okay a monster prediction from Bank of America another US debt downgrade is
[18:27.040 --> 18:32.320]  coming in just a few weeks this article says from business insider calm another
[18:32.320 --> 18:38.760]  debt downgrade what could that do to the US hmm well the ability of the United
[18:38.760 --> 18:41.920]  States to be able to sell more debt could be in jeopardy they would have to pay
[18:41.920 --> 18:49.000]  higher rates which of course pushes the debt cycle the spiral into overdrive not
[18:49.000 --> 18:54.480]  a very pretty picture I hinted at this Perry to pitch scrapping the tax code
[18:54.480 --> 19:00.520]  and offering an optional 20% flat tax now a little bit of commentary on this
[19:00.520 --> 19:05.600]  look I wouldn't mind as a citizen if this were honest if this were true if you
[19:05.600 --> 19:11.680]  could trust Rick Perry yeah I didn't mean to get into comedy there but if you
[19:11.680 --> 19:16.160]  could trust Rick Perry and this were really a 20% flat tax I wouldn't mind
[19:16.160 --> 19:20.080]  paying 20% flat tax okay I wouldn't mind that at all get rid of the paperwork
[19:20.080 --> 19:25.080]  right get rid of all this collecting of receipts where you have to be like a
[19:25.080 --> 19:30.600]  human pack rat collecting paper everywhere for seven years just to be able
[19:30.600 --> 19:33.360]  to calculate how much you think you owe and then they can come in and say
[19:33.360 --> 19:37.320]  that's wrong and that you're trying to cheat on your taxes just because it's
[19:37.320 --> 19:42.240]  too complex I wouldn't mind paying the 20% if it were honest but you know it's
[19:42.240 --> 19:46.680]  not going to be you know they're gonna slap more taxes on top of the flat
[19:46.680 --> 19:53.280]  taxes so Perry we know what games you're up to we've seen you in action here in

[24:43.040 --> 24:47.120]  pusher but here we go and by the way a lot of these articles are up on info
[24:47.120 --> 24:53.000]  wars.com Dr. Paul Craig Roberts has an article called reckless endangerment
[24:53.000 --> 24:58.840]  totally corrupt America man I love this this guy's writing Paul Craig Roberts
[24:58.840 --> 25:03.040]  is one of the best writers out there today and this article is posted on
[25:03.040 --> 25:08.280]  info wars.com so be sure to check that and here you know he really lays out the
[25:08.280 --> 25:13.380]  case for how America the whole political system has evolved into really just a
[25:13.380 --> 25:17.760]  bunch of gangs that's what we're dealing with here we're just criminal gangs
[25:17.760 --> 25:22.800]  that now have government quote authority it's really just a system of
[25:22.800 --> 25:28.720]  gangs you know the medical system is a is a gang in many towns our cities the
[25:28.720 --> 25:32.560]  police are gangs I'm not saying all police are bad I know there are great
[25:32.560 --> 25:37.000]  ones out there they're honest ones out there but many of them are really just
[25:37.000 --> 25:40.960]  gangs with badges and you know what I'm talking about the corrupt ones the the
[25:40.960 --> 25:46.600]  FDA it's a gang the DEA a big-time gang right there drug dealing gang that
[25:46.600 --> 25:52.720]  pretends to suppress drugs oh my gosh we've also curtain emmo is also covering
[25:52.720 --> 25:58.320]  Rick Perry's 20% flat tax scheme in another article on info wars.com so
[25:58.320 --> 26:04.120]  check that out today here's a story that has just been breaking it actually came
[26:04.120 --> 26:08.640]  out yesterday teen violence linked to heavy soda consumption that's kind of
[26:08.640 --> 26:13.720]  interesting that they found that the teens who drink the most soda actually
[26:13.720 --> 26:17.560]  have well they commit the most violent acts now it doesn't necessarily mean
[26:17.560 --> 26:22.960]  soda causes violence it could just be a correlation that hey violent teens love
[26:22.960 --> 26:29.040]  to drink soda pop it could be let's go beat somebody up and then have a coke
[26:29.040 --> 26:33.360]  yeah I guess that's what's going on but we're gonna be covering this on natural
[26:33.360 --> 26:38.640]  news too I post an article today that's been also been picked up at info wars
[26:38.640 --> 26:43.280]  the second American Revolution has begun there I lay out a case for how
[26:43.280 --> 26:46.840]  everything is really a criminal operation everything in the government of
[26:46.840 --> 26:51.000]  course I'm talking about but also you know Wall Street the banksters the global
[26:51.000 --> 26:56.520]  banking elite the drug industry the vaccine industry the fluoride industry
[26:56.520 --> 27:00.200]  which is really just a way to get the public to drink a bunch of toxic
[27:00.200 --> 27:05.040]  chemicals how crazy is that the Supreme Court has ruled that thousands of home
[27:05.040 --> 27:09.760]  foreclosures are invalid because banks just don't have the documentation to
[27:09.760 --> 27:14.480]  support that that's not really new news but there's it's just been the state I
[27:14.480 --> 27:19.040]  should say that's the state Supreme Court of Massachusetts I believe yeah so
[27:19.040 --> 27:23.320]  not the US Supreme Court let me correct myself on that the state Supreme Court
[27:23.320 --> 27:29.160]  ordered that in or made that decision in Massachusetts so now we've we've got
[27:29.160 --> 27:36.240]  thousands of people there who think they bought a foreclosed home from a bank and
[27:36.240 --> 27:39.840]  it may turn out they don't really own that home and then it may turn out that
[27:39.840 --> 27:43.200]  all these people who bought the homes in the first place and the banks are
[27:43.200 --> 27:47.000]  trying to foreclose on them those people may still own those homes and the
[27:47.000 --> 27:50.660]  banks may not own them at all man what a mess just another example of the
[27:50.660 --> 27:55.480]  criminality of the financial system that is just coming apart at the seams
[27:55.480 --> 28:00.920]  there a lot of this is unraveling all right the Federal Reserve hoax is
[28:00.920 --> 28:05.560]  unraveling this is what's great about the protests happening today and I don't
[28:05.560 --> 28:09.160]  agree with all the protesters messages but for many of them they they're right
[28:09.160 --> 28:13.600]  on on the mark they are unraveling the lies and the corruption and the
[28:13.600 --> 28:18.680]  criminality of our system today like the fact that we keep starting wars so that
[28:18.680 --> 28:23.600]  we can fight them so that we can have a military industrial complex that keeps
[28:23.600 --> 28:28.360]  earning money to keep fighting the same wars that we keep causing you know
[28:28.360 --> 28:33.320]  classic case Libya now what have we installed there al-Qaeda as the ruling
[28:33.320 --> 28:38.000]  regime so now what are we going to do come in and and fight al-Qaeda another
[28:38.000 --> 28:44.200]  year or two later another case for war got to have perpetual war 1984 is alive
[28:44.200 --> 28:49.400]  and well today all right we're okay just one more minute here a couple more
[28:49.400 --> 28:55.080]  headlines we announced by the way a flu shot propaganda photo contest and we'll
[28:55.080 --> 28:58.800]  be sharing these photos with info wars this is over at natural news so if you've
[28:58.800 --> 29:03.880]  got some photos of some flu shot marketing propaganda that you see out

[29:07.640 --> 29:10.920]  to us at natural news we'll be sharing those with info wars and probably even
[29:10.920 --> 29:16.240]  doing a special video report on the collection of flu shot propaganda remember
[29:16.240 --> 29:22.320]  we had a photo earlier last week about grim reapers that are promoting flu
[29:22.320 --> 29:26.760]  shots at a CVS pharmacy yeah life-size grim reapers holding the sign get your
[29:26.760 --> 29:31.440]  flu shot and the other part of that message is and I guess because they're
[29:31.440 --> 29:36.880]  grim reapers a cruel Halloween hoax okay on the other side of this break stay
[29:36.880 --> 29:40.280]  with us here on the Alex Jones show we're gonna be joined by Gwen Olson

[33:29.720 --> 33:34.920]  minute let me give a brief intro to that information and why her book really
[33:34.920 --> 33:39.960]  matters and also just want to say thank you for for listening in and you're
[33:39.960 --> 33:43.760]  going to learn a lot today in this interview coming up a lot about the
[33:43.760 --> 33:47.920]  pharmaceutical industry from an insider's perspective this is information
[33:47.920 --> 33:51.640]  that they will not tell you in the mainstream media they will not tell you
[33:51.640 --> 33:55.560]  in the drug advertisements that you see on television hey you won't even find
[33:55.560 --> 33:59.480]  this on the FDA's website because they don't want you to know this information
[33:59.480 --> 34:04.800]  now the book is called confessions of an RX drug pusher I've been describing it
[34:04.800 --> 34:08.720]  as a prescription drug pusher but it's the title is really RX so if you're
[34:08.720 --> 34:12.120]  looking for this on amazon.com or wherever you buy books go to
[34:12.120 --> 34:17.400]  confessions of an RX drug pusher and we'll show you a shot of that book here
[34:17.400 --> 34:22.480]  in a second for those of you watching on prisonplanet.tv now Gwen Olson has won
[34:22.480 --> 34:29.200]  numerous accolades and awards for her work as a journalist reporting again as
[34:29.200 --> 34:32.760]  an insider a former insider in the pharmaceutical industry she's been
[34:32.760 --> 34:36.960]  featured on all kinds of news the television shows radio programs all
[34:36.960 --> 34:41.320]  across the country she dares to tell the truth she has tremendous courage and
[34:41.320 --> 34:46.080]  she is in my opinion helping people save their lives from the dangers of
[34:46.080 --> 34:50.120]  pharmaceuticals she joins us here in studio today on the Alex Jones show
[34:50.120 --> 34:53.120]  Gwen thank you for joining us today thanks for having me it's a pleasure to
[34:53.120 --> 34:56.040]  be here hey it's nice nice to have you I'm just gonna scoot this microphone a
[34:56.040 --> 35:01.960]  little closer to you there okay make sure everybody can hear you so give us
[35:01.960 --> 35:06.040]  the quick version of a little bit of your background how you used to be an
[35:06.040 --> 35:11.480]  insider and what made you change your mind and start speaking out about the
[35:11.480 --> 35:16.760]  dangers of how these drugs are marketed especially to children well I spent the
[35:16.760 --> 35:20.680]  vast majority of my time in the pharmaceutical industry as a specialty
[35:20.680 --> 35:26.600]  rep from 1985 until the year 2000 so I was primarily calling on your specialists
[35:26.600 --> 35:32.840]  such as cardiologist, endocrinologist, OBGYN and psychiatry and throughout my
[35:32.840 --> 35:38.360]  15-year tenure I worked for four major manufacturers and I started to realize
[35:38.360 --> 35:43.520]  that they all had one thing in common and that was that they considered human
[35:43.520 --> 35:48.040]  beings to be a human commodity and that they expected a certain number of us to
[35:48.040 --> 35:52.000]  lose our lives in the utilization of their products so this was just part of
[35:52.000 --> 35:55.280]  their formula they know we're gonna sell a hundred million dollars of this drug
[35:55.280 --> 36:00.000]  X number of children are gonna die or adults are gonna die and to them that's
[36:00.000 --> 36:03.800]  acceptable yes when I don't know if they actually have it down X number of
[36:03.800 --> 36:07.040]  children or X number of adults but you know we anticipate that they're going
[36:07.040 --> 36:10.520]  to be certain number of deaths certain in certain number of side effects and we
[36:10.520 --> 36:14.640]  also put aside a kitty for lawsuits that will probably result as you know
[36:14.640 --> 36:18.080]  because of that except in the vaccine industry where they have the national
[36:18.080 --> 36:21.960]  vaccine injury compensation program where you can't sue through the normal
[36:21.960 --> 36:27.080]  courts correct all total okay I'm sorry go ahead correct so I was in in the
[36:27.080 --> 36:31.440]  industry for a period of 15 years and over that course of time it wasn't like
[36:31.440 --> 36:34.360]  you know one day that I said oh my god I'm in the pharmaceutical industry I have
[36:34.360 --> 36:39.760]  to get out it was a series of events I mean I started waking up consciously in
[36:39.760 --> 36:43.240]  the pharmaceutical industry so this is a spiritual calling for me what I'm doing
[36:43.240 --> 36:49.080]  but it was you know it was just one event after another that I started
[36:49.080 --> 36:53.680]  observing that I was being told to misinform providers that I was being
[36:53.680 --> 36:58.240]  given information myself that was incorrect and I was supposed to minimize
[36:58.240 --> 37:03.160]  side effects and I was constantly being trained to divert the attention of the
[37:03.160 --> 37:06.280]  the health care provider from the problems that you know were created by
[37:06.280 --> 37:11.080]  my portfolio of drugs okay whoa that's a lot that you said already let me let me
[37:11.080 --> 37:14.680]  start first of all the money is good as a pharmaceutical rep isn't it yes I made
[37:14.680 --> 37:19.800]  six figures before I was 26 years old wow okay company car and benefits and
[37:19.800 --> 37:23.760]  okay so you got a car a six-figure salary yes so your job was to go around and
[37:23.760 --> 37:28.480]  visit the doctor's offices and basically persuade them to prescribe your
[37:28.480 --> 37:33.960]  company's drugs to their patients yes my job was presented as an educational
[37:33.960 --> 37:38.280]  position where I was to educate physicians but my job was a marketing job
[37:38.280 --> 37:42.920]  where I was meant to increase the bottom line of my company's portfolio and in
[37:42.920 --> 37:48.520]  this education job as you as you say you just said that part of what you were
[37:48.520 --> 37:53.160]  told to do was to minimize side effects you know to minimize any discussion
[37:53.160 --> 37:58.960]  about side effects perhaps to exaggerate drug benefits absolutely absolutely in
[37:58.960 --> 38:02.760]  fact every training that we did anytime we went to a meeting anytime we went to
[38:02.760 --> 38:07.120]  any you know pool meetings or gatherings of numerous reps together we would have
[38:07.120 --> 38:11.680]  training sessions called knee to knees and toe to toes where you'd have one rep
[38:11.680 --> 38:14.960]  that would oppose stand in line and oppose the other representative one
[38:14.960 --> 38:18.760]  playing the doctor and one playing the rep then we would we would take
[38:18.760 --> 38:23.320]  different objections that people were hearing in the field and we would learn
[38:23.320 --> 38:28.400]  to manage those and minimize that doctor's concerns for that objection so
[38:28.400 --> 38:31.880]  you would have marketing personnel and management there that would be directing
[38:31.880 --> 38:35.760]  you and a legal person very often if you were in the home office wow and we
[38:35.760 --> 38:40.840]  would all practice regurgitating the exact same response to that particular
[38:40.840 --> 38:44.520]  concern wow so role-playing practicing you know if you were doing that with
[38:44.520 --> 38:48.200]  raw milk you'd be charged with conspiracy that's a conspiracy right
[38:48.200 --> 38:52.000]  there I'd be in jail if you're sitting with somebody and you're planning how to
[38:52.000 --> 38:57.800]  persuade someone that's a conspiracy okay so then but this so you were very
[38:57.800 --> 39:01.320]  effective I would say you were very effective I was in the top 3% of any
[39:01.320 --> 39:04.800]  company I ever worked for which in the only reason I say that that's my ego
[39:04.800 --> 39:08.120]  speaking I was the best of the best of the best but that's what that industry
[39:08.120 --> 39:11.440]  is about and I don't want people thinking that I'm speaking out because I'm
[39:11.440 --> 39:15.000]  disgruntled I couldn't make it in the industry that the only reason I stayed
[39:15.000 --> 39:18.280]  in the industry was because I was extremely effective at my job they
[39:18.280 --> 39:21.000]  didn't ever put up with all my questions otherwise so you could have
[39:21.000 --> 39:25.000]  continued in that industry and made millions of dollars and continue to
[39:25.000 --> 39:28.840]  climb the corporate ladder a millionaire you sure you don't want to be the vice
[39:28.840 --> 39:33.840]  president of Pfizer's global vaccine division like the former CDC head Julie
[39:33.840 --> 39:38.440]  Gerberding I sleep very well at night I don't think he does unless he takes
[39:38.440 --> 39:42.640]  ambium well I think she sleeps just fine because she's taking sleep sleeping
[39:42.640 --> 39:47.020]  pills from her employer there okay that's just a joke for those of you for
[39:47.020 --> 39:51.520]  those lawyers out there who are wondering okay in your book by the way can
[39:51.520 --> 39:54.680]  you hold up your books so people can see it on on prismplan.tv
[39:54.680 --> 40:00.160]  confessions of an RX drug pusher and this is available everywhere what's your
[40:00.160 --> 40:05.760]  website by the way it's Gwen Olson.com G-W-E-N-O-L-S-E-N dot com
[40:05.760 --> 40:10.080]  Gwen Olson.com great and I know I notice you have some articles a little bit of a
[40:10.080 --> 40:14.720]  of a sort of a running blog and information can Jen can we bring up
[40:14.720 --> 40:17.840]  that website just to show people what that is what else can can people find
[40:17.840 --> 40:21.960]  there well I really have it's a nice site where everybody can go and get good
[40:21.960 --> 40:27.640]  information I can get information from you I put a lot of your articles I put
[40:27.640 --> 40:31.480]  a lot of different information on there just trying to keep abreast of things
[40:31.480 --> 40:36.520]  so that people have one resource site that they can go to. What do you think
[40:36.520 --> 40:42.320]  of this breaking news that we have now where the US government wants to study
[40:42.320 --> 40:47.440]  anthrax vaccines by using American children as guinea pigs injecting them
[40:47.440 --> 40:52.280]  with this vaccine to see what happens. Well you know I'm a child advocate and
[40:52.280 --> 40:56.440]  so that's actually the crux of my work and my mission is about informed
[40:56.440 --> 41:00.160]  consent and keeping our children safe because as adults I believe we have the
[41:00.160 --> 41:04.240]  right to take and put into our bodies whatever we choose that for our children
[41:04.240 --> 41:07.960]  I think we really have the responsibility to get it right because they do not
[41:07.960 --> 41:14.560]  have an option and they cannot refuse our treatments so I have a very personal
[41:14.560 --> 41:18.800]  view of this because my husband quite frankly has had his health destroyed by
[41:18.800 --> 41:23.400]  the anthrax vaccine he was one of the weekend warriors that was reactivated and
[41:23.400 --> 41:27.640]  had to go to the Gulf War really and they gave him the anthrax vaccine when he
[41:27.640 --> 41:33.280]  went he was extremely healthy he biked he when surfed he swam he was
[41:33.280 --> 41:37.960]  extremely healthy in fact he was in the peak of his health when he came back he
[41:37.960 --> 41:42.960]  developed all kinds of health issues including asthma and allergies and his
[41:42.960 --> 41:48.160]  thyroid stopped functioning he's had critically high blood pressure he's got
[41:48.160 --> 41:53.160]  extremely high lipid profiles and I attribute this to the vaccines and other
[41:53.160 --> 41:59.320]  things that he was exposed to but Glenn the government says that there's no
[41:59.320 --> 42:03.440]  correlation between these experimental vaccines that all the Gulf War veterans
[42:03.440 --> 42:08.200]  for example were given and they're the the side effects that they are
[42:08.200 --> 42:12.360]  experiencing the neurological issues the asthma the autoimmune disorders and so
[42:12.360 --> 42:15.840]  on they say there's no correlation and by the way they've had people sitting in
[42:15.840 --> 42:19.360]  rooms role-playing back and forth with the press you know to make sure they
[42:19.360 --> 42:23.200]  get their answers straight on that probably with a big White House lawyer
[42:23.200 --> 42:28.560]  along for the ride or a Pentagon lawyer as well but they say that that what you
[42:28.560 --> 42:32.280]  just said is completely false what what's your response to that well
[42:32.280 --> 42:37.600]  obviously my story is anecdotal but I also have to respond that I found that
[42:37.600 --> 42:42.400]  the government lies quite frequently no particularly when they're in
[42:42.400 --> 42:45.760]  collusion with the pharmaceutical industry and so I try to tell people
[42:45.760 --> 42:50.040]  that you know I'm not a conspiracy theorist because I can prove everything
[42:50.040 --> 42:53.560]  that I say and I think a lot of people if they did their own due diligence would
[42:53.560 --> 42:57.840]  realize we're being lied to about a lot of things particularly by our government
[42:57.840 --> 43:02.960]  I cannot I can't believe that we I can't believe we would have a guest here who
[43:02.960 --> 43:08.440]  would say the government lies how dare we all right chapter three of your book
[43:08.440 --> 43:13.360]  is a case against antidepressants now there was breaking news last week I
[43:13.360 --> 43:18.400]  believe or the week before that what 11 12% percent of the American people are
[43:18.400 --> 43:26.000]  on antidepressant drugs every day of their lives it's incredible what does
[43:26.000 --> 43:29.720]  that say to you as someone has been now on sort of you've seen both sides of
[43:29.720 --> 43:33.840]  this industry are you concerned about this trend I'm very concerned about it
[43:33.840 --> 43:37.320]  and I think that the advertising is obviously a lot more effective than the
[43:37.320 --> 43:40.880]  drugs are because I've done my due diligence and I know that the drugs are
[43:40.880 --> 43:46.800]  no more effective than 10% more than placebo and that 60% of that efficacy
[43:46.800 --> 43:50.440]  is placebo effect which means that if you take a drug you think you're going
[43:50.440 --> 43:53.840]  to get cured and therefore because you have that ability of the mind body
[43:53.840 --> 44:00.080]  spiritual connection to heal yourself you will heal so I know that antidepressants
[44:00.080 --> 44:04.240]  are not effective I know that they're trying to move a lot of that market and
[44:04.240 --> 44:07.360]  I predicted this actually five years ago that they would move a lot of the
[44:07.360 --> 44:11.200]  antidepressant market into the antipsychotic market as soon as people
[44:11.200 --> 44:15.480]  became privy to the fact that they didn't work and now we have treatment
[44:15.480 --> 44:20.080]  resistant depression where they add on antipsychotics but I was like whoa why
[44:20.080 --> 44:23.440]  didn't I think of that what about oppositional defiance disorder oh hey
[44:23.440 --> 44:27.400]  that's my favorite diagnosed with that myself yeah just for those listening
[44:27.400 --> 44:33.080]  oppositional defiance disorder is a legitimate well I just say a fraudulently
[44:33.080 --> 44:38.160]  fabricated disease that the psychiatric industry says is legitimate that you
[44:38.160 --> 44:42.000]  could be diagnosed with this by disagreeing with authority figures and
[44:42.000 --> 44:47.080]  then you need treatment hey I was a rebel with a cause well you know you
[44:47.080 --> 44:52.040]  know having your own independent ideas Gwen that's that's almost terrorism I
[44:52.040 --> 44:57.960]  mean that's that is that's like betraying the country I guess now to have
[44:57.960 --> 45:01.960]  your own ideas well I think we both probably fall under the definition of a
[45:01.960 --> 45:08.320]  homeland here well speaking of terrorism let's go on to other chapters of your
[45:08.320 --> 45:14.680]  book the okay man you've got a chapter here called another one flew over the
[45:14.680 --> 45:19.880]  cuckoo's nest betrayal of the public trust what what about what about the
[45:19.880 --> 45:24.320]  FDA's conspiracy with the pharmaceutical industry here where they they
[45:24.320 --> 45:29.440]  knowingly approved drugs that they know are fraudulently that the trials are
[45:29.440 --> 45:35.080]  fraud I mean we've seen cases where many clinical trial doctors are just making
[45:35.080 --> 45:38.680]  up the numbers literally making it up and to get published in peer-reviewed
[45:38.680 --> 45:42.280]  medical journals and then years later they get caught but thousands of other
[45:42.280 --> 45:45.800]  scientists have already quoted their study and now it's considered scientific
[45:45.800 --> 45:50.840]  fact it was all complete hoax or they do like Dr. Biederman did at Harvard and
[45:50.840 --> 45:55.040]  they promise a result an outcome from the studies before the studies are even
[45:55.040 --> 46:00.880]  conducted so the studies a lot of the studies are overseas they're done
[46:00.880 --> 46:04.520]  overseas now and they're in third-world countries you know where they lay down
[46:04.520 --> 46:07.400]  millions and millions of dollars and they say this is what we're looking for
[46:07.400 --> 46:10.800]  you know as if that's not going to come back so that they can get you know
[46:10.800 --> 46:17.440]  future studies done in those areas but it's to me it's just a big it's a big
[46:17.440 --> 46:23.160]  collusive effort from the pharmaceutical industry to the FDA to just get
[46:23.160 --> 46:26.920]  everybody covered and all of their bases covered they're pushing drugs
[46:26.920 --> 46:30.720]  through the system and fast-tracking them because the pharmaceutical industry
[46:30.720 --> 46:34.320]  doesn't want to wait you know for the appropriate R&D to be you know
[46:34.320 --> 46:38.880]  conducted right and it takes time to to fabricate and they they claim to lose a
[46:38.880 --> 46:42.400]  million dollars a day you know and while they're waiting for those to get
[46:42.400 --> 46:48.320]  patents however I do know that a lot of the FDA members are just people that are
[46:48.320 --> 46:53.680]  basically waiting to get out and retire from the FDA and go into consulting
[46:53.680 --> 46:57.160]  positions into the pharmaceutical industry it's a revolving door they go
[46:57.160 --> 47:00.560]  in and out of one another and particularly in government as well so I
[47:00.560 --> 47:05.160]  mean people just need to follow the money trail and they would realize how much
[47:05.160 --> 47:09.400]  we are at risk in terms of well isn't that's the theme of everything going on
[47:09.400 --> 47:12.880]  today if you follow the money trail you know then you can figure out you can
[47:12.880 --> 47:16.680]  decode the matrix you can see what's happening in our world and Gwen by the
[47:16.680 --> 47:20.240]  way you are an American hero I'm gonna say that on the record you are a hero
[47:20.240 --> 47:24.600]  you are a real hero not these fake false heroes that are trying to run for
[47:24.600 --> 47:28.880]  president today there's only one hero running for president that's Ron Paul in
[47:28.880 --> 47:33.320]  my in my opinion but I want to I want to take some calls by the way after this
[47:33.320 --> 47:38.240]  break so if you're listening to this and you got a question for Gwen maybe you
[47:38.240 --> 47:43.240]  have a local doctor pushing psychiatric drugs on your kid and you got a
[47:43.240 --> 47:46.600]  question about that well Gwen's not a not a doctor but she's been in the
[47:46.600 --> 47:49.240]  industry she might be able to give you some insight so get your questions ready
[47:49.240 --> 47:53.680]  and I hope we can do some call-ins here we'll do that after the break but you
[47:53.680 --> 47:57.280]  know getting ready for that we've also got that the whole vaccine industry is
[47:57.280 --> 48:04.560]  now being exposed as a total fraud the flu vaccine doesn't work but and the
[48:04.560 --> 48:10.360]  Gardasil vaccine is maiming and killing some some children that's exploded in
[48:10.360 --> 48:14.560]  the press recently so we're winning that's right we are winning and we're
[48:14.560 --> 48:19.320]  winning by virtue of people waking up to the reality that we are not safe and
[48:19.320 --> 48:23.960]  that these that our government is not benevolent caretakers of us we need to
[48:23.960 --> 48:29.080]  be aware and we need to self educate and that's what you can do folks by reading
[48:29.080 --> 48:32.960]  Gwen Olson's website again Gwen Olson.com that's correct all right yeah
[48:32.960 --> 48:38.760]  and I hope by the way I hope maybe you'll write for us from time to time I
[48:38.760 --> 48:42.340]  would love to. I would love to have some of your stories up there by the way
[48:42.340 --> 48:47.200]  Gwen Olson did win a human rights award from CCHR which speaks out against
[48:47.200 --> 48:51.600]  psychiatric medicine I've also been recognized by that organization you
[48:51.600 --> 48:55.040]  know the bottom line here is you and I I think operate from a sense of compassion
[48:55.040 --> 48:58.640]  for children especially. Absolutely. We don't want to see children maimed and
[48:58.640 --> 49:02.800]  harmed how I mean is that what you feel in your heart when you write this this
[49:02.800 --> 49:06.640]  kind of book? Absolutely and actually you know I worked for five years in the
[49:06.640 --> 49:10.600]  Texas foster care system as a court-appointed special advocate CASA
[49:10.600 --> 49:15.040]  and I was still in the pharmaceutical industry at that time and I started to
[49:15.040 --> 49:18.880]  see how that children that were you know just had a bad rap in life and got
[49:18.880 --> 49:23.280]  placed in the system were literally a profit center for psychiatric drugging
[49:23.280 --> 49:28.840]  and because of the Texas medication algorithm project that we had here they
[49:28.840 --> 49:33.320]  were getting not only you know major psychiatric drugs but the most expensive
[49:33.320 --> 49:36.960]  drugs that were on the market and the taxpayers were paying for them so I
[49:36.960 --> 49:40.760]  really became alarmed about that when I saw that all my little two three and
[49:40.760 --> 49:43.240]  four-year-old kiddos they would come into the system and they were
[49:43.240 --> 49:48.400]  immediately drugged. Incredible just incredible well we're gonna be going to
[49:48.400 --> 49:51.920]  break here shortly and we're gonna be coming back with your calls I see we've
[49:51.920 --> 49:56.040]  got Aaron from Nevada Joe from Pennsylvania Salivia from California

[50:26.040 --> 50:30.080]  said as as a child advocate the most astonishing thing that I saw was
[50:30.080 --> 50:34.480]  every manufacturer that I worked for in the pharmaceutical industry brought
[50:34.480 --> 50:40.240]  home the fact that our children were the most lucrative expansion market
[50:40.240 --> 50:44.520]  available to the industry. Alright sorry to cut you off we're about to go to break
[50:44.520 --> 50:49.800]  it's all about money folks making money off of children like the matrix but it's
[50:49.800 --> 50:52.560]  the pharmaceutical matrix stay with us here on the Alex Jones show we'll be
[50:52.560 --> 51:01.640]  back with Gwen Olson on the other side of this break. This is Alex Jones with

[55:50.980 --> 55:55.920]  we're continuing in the studio right now with Gwen Olson a former pharmaceutical
[55:55.920 --> 56:00.960]  insider a very successful sales rep marketing rep for the pharma industry
[56:00.960 --> 56:04.440]  who has now written a book called confessions of an RX drug pusher well
[56:04.440 --> 56:08.520]  that book has been out what a year actually it came out in 2005 and I
[56:08.520 --> 56:12.280]  just revamped in 2009 okay so just the update came out a couple of years ago
[56:12.280 --> 56:15.880]  also we're gonna be taking your calls here in this segment and the number is
[56:15.880 --> 56:22.360]  1-800-259-9231 please call in on this topic and we welcome your calls love to
[56:22.360 --> 56:25.760]  hear from you and you got your headphones on you ready to go
[56:25.760 --> 56:31.760]  all right here we go Aaron in Nevada you are on the air with Gwen Olson hi
[56:31.760 --> 56:38.280]  Aaron hi hey thank you very much well just like on a positive note is it a
[56:38.280 --> 56:44.120]  good business opportunity potentially to get into selling pharmaceuticals to like
[56:44.120 --> 56:48.160]  you know the retiring baby boomer generation type of thing a wholesale or
[56:48.160 --> 56:53.760]  type you know maybe internet retail something like that yeah good one Aaron
[56:53.760 --> 56:58.640]  Aaron's playing played along with us here clever clever question right so
[56:58.640 --> 57:04.760]  yeah obviously Aaron it's a very lucrative position with the baby boomer
[57:04.760 --> 57:09.520]  population being what it is we obviously are going to be all using drugs or
[57:09.520 --> 57:13.080]  they're hoping that we're all going to be using drugs into the tune of five to
[57:13.080 --> 57:20.280]  six items however I think that my my own advice personally would be not to get
[57:20.280 --> 57:23.560]  into the pharmaceutical industry because it's a house of cards that will
[57:23.560 --> 57:27.960]  implode oh that's good news yes I'm sure we'll be talking to you more is that as
[57:27.960 --> 57:32.400]  that happens it is a house of cards Aaron did you have a follow-up question
[57:32.400 --> 57:38.800]  um no that was a good one though thank thanks for your call let's go on to Joe
[57:38.800 --> 57:46.880]  in Pennsylvania Joe you're on the air with Gwen Olson go ahead please I got a
[57:46.880 --> 57:54.360]  lot of questions I take drugs and not all drugs are bad but first question
[57:54.360 --> 57:58.600]  remember back when AIDS came out they were doing all these experimental drugs
[57:58.600 --> 58:04.240]  in the community was screaming that they come out faster so they started fast
[58:04.240 --> 58:10.840]  tracking the drugs yeah yes is that the catalyst that kept the fast tracking
[58:10.840 --> 58:16.200]  going in your opinion first question we we're almost out of time go ahead and
[58:16.200 --> 58:19.400]  answer that as quickly as you can actually I believe that it was the
[58:19.400 --> 58:25.000]  pedophile legislation that came out that caused that that's a prescription
[58:25.000 --> 58:30.080]  drug user fee act and that was probably what caused the fast tracking and it was
[58:30.080 --> 58:34.640]  about that same time and for that issue okay great question sorry we're almost
[58:34.640 --> 58:37.480]  out of time Gwen can you stay with us for a couple minutes on the other side of
[58:37.480 --> 58:45.160]  this break stay with us here on info wars this is GCN the Genesis

[01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:05.120]  afternoon my fellow terrorists yeah good afternoon yeah here we are you found
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:10.400]  us what yeah Glenn I wanted to say I am so glad that you're on here covering this
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:17.200]  topic I am I'm an insurance agent and I run into people all the times I mean I've
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:23.280]  seen seniors on 19 medications a day it's ridiculous I've got a niece that's on
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:28.160]  six of these psychotropic medications and I'm trying to get her you know to get
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:31.920]  out of that whole system but here's what I wanted to ask about I had seen
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:36.640]  documentation Alex has covered this in the past on the show and I just wanted
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:43.360]  as a former insider I'm glad I can say former and I know you are too but the
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:49.000]  connections because you know what I've seen is that the basically the FDA is
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:53.320]  run by the pharmaceutical industry they're all former executives and people
[01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:59.320]  within it you know that run that whole thing and but I've seen documentation
[01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:04.440]  to the fact that at the end of World War two our so-called intelligence
[01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:10.200]  networks had a secretive opera covert operation called operation taper clip
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:16.440]  where they secretly transported smuggled these Nazi eugenicists out of Germany
[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:20.760]  and transported them over here and they're basically the ones that started
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:23.880]  the pharmaceutical industry so what I wanted to say and then I'd like you to
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:28.280]  respond to this is that the issue here is not this money although that is an
[01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:32.360]  issue you know the Bible says the law both money is the root of all evil make
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:35.480]  them I'm gonna I'm gonna ask when to go ahead and comment on that because we've
[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:38.880]  only got a couple minutes left that's a great question you're right you're right
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:42.240]  on the point here Steven go ahead Gwen okay but exactly what was the question it
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:46.480]  was so multifaceted I think he's asking do you agree with that assessment that
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:49.280]  that the Nazi Germany scientists were brought over and made part of the
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:52.800]  pharmaceuticals that's the absolute truth and to that information I've also
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:57.680]  seen all of that yes what about the eugenics agenda eugenics agenda I do
[01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:01.520]  believe very much so that that's a big part of what the psychiatric drugging is
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:06.440]  all about I believe that's what the vaccine industry is all about I believe
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:09.920]  that's what a lot of it's all about but you know it's not a subject matter that
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:14.400]  we that we broach frequently with the general public because people do not
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:19.080]  believe that this could be taking place and what I'm trying to get people do is
[01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:22.800]  do their own due diligence and their own discovery process that this is in fact

[01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:23.720]  mike adams the health ranger editor of natural news dot com filling in for alex
[01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:27.360]  today who's in the air on an airplane right now coming back he'll be joining
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:32.880]  us on the info wars nightly news tonight to give us some breaking news about his
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:38.560]  incident I don't know what it is with the TSA in Las Vegas apparently
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:42.600]  something took place there and we're going to find out about it tonight as
[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:47.400]  alex returns I guess we'll be landing in Austin in a couple of hours and then
[01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:52.760]  he'll be on the nightly news that's the plan so be sure to tune in on prison
[01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:56.240]  planet TV for the nightly news we just finished a segment with Gwen Olson
[01:08:56.240 --> 01:09:00.280]  former pharmaceutical insider what a great segment what a great woman that
[01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:06.120]  is you know it takes courage to give up a six figure salary and tell the truth
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:12.240]  and make less money and help save children from the chemical poisoning of
[01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:17.120]  the pharmaceutical industry and be willing to be criticized for it and be
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:22.320]  willing to go out in the mainstream media and tell your truth knowing that
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:28.560]  you're going to have an entire army of public relations trolls aligned against
[01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:35.960]  you because the pharmaceutical industry hires PR companies to run online sort of
[01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:42.240]  like a smash smash and grab operations I don't know a drive-by shootings you
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:47.080]  might say an online drive-by shooting a drive-by blogging maybe you could say
[01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:51.040]  they hire companies to do that and they run around trying to discredit
[01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:54.160]  everybody hey they talked about that right here on Info Wars every time a
[01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:59.200]  video is posted from Alex immediately there are 12 negative comments or
[01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:04.480]  negative votes just within 60 seconds how does that happen it's because these
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:10.000]  companies hire all these trolls to run around attacking people like me or
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:15.160]  people like Alex because or people like Gwen because we are willing to tell the
[01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:21.720]  truth and that's why we are winning that's why Info Wars is expanding like
[01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:27.480]  crazy that's why Info Wars is having such success in reaching people and
[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:32.280]  opening minds and raising awareness because we are willing to tell the truth
[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:37.600]  even at the risk of being criticized we don't care we don't care if a bunch of
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:42.840]  paid PR trolls say that we're making stuff up now we're bringing you the
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:47.800]  actual truth regardless of whatever consequences happen out there I can
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:51.720]  sleep much better at night knowing that we're telling the truth rather than
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:54.440]  just doing something for money which is what the pharmaceutical reps are doing
[01:10:54.440 --> 01:11:02.560]  and we talked about the anthrax vaccine let me get into that segment here we
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:06.640]  have the Washington Post reporting that the anthrax vaccines effectiveness in
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:12.280]  children stirs a debate the White House is trying to decide whether they
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:16.720]  should inject children with this anthrax vaccine to determine if it works and
[01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:20.600]  they think well this is a bioethics question so they have a group of
[01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:25.680]  bioethicists a bunch of advisors who are trying to argue yeah we should use
[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:30.400]  children as guinea pigs now because we might be able to save children in the
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:35.080]  future if there is an anthrax attack in America then we'll have a vaccine ready
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:39.200]  to inject into them but the cost of doing that today is that we're going to
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:43.320]  have to probably sacrifice a few children today because you know the
[01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:46.480]  governments of the world the big controllers are always into child
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:50.920]  sacrifice that goes back throughout history they know some children might
[01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:55.320]  die some children might have permanent damaged neurological side effects who
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:59.800]  knows what but they they are arguing that that's going to be worth it well I
[01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:04.520]  say that's nonsense that's complete nonsense first of all the children
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:09.620]  aren't going to encounter anthrax just at the playground at school there would
[01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:14.360]  have to be a bioterrorism attack in order to expose children to anthrax
[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:19.760]  and secondly what's this idea who's going to make the money from this anyway
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:23.760]  of course the pharmaceutical industries so this is just another example of
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:29.160]  trying to use innocent children the bodies of American children to make
[01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:34.480]  more money for the pharmaceutical industry and they're trying to justify it by
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:39.320]  saying oh this is ethical we could save more lives in the future by sacrificing
[01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:43.920]  a few now isn't that I mean isn't that what every tyrant throughout history has
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:49.160]  always said isn't that the the entire eugenics movement in a nutshell yeah we
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:54.160]  can save the human race by sacrificing a few people today making them infertile
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:57.600]  or just outright killing them and then the human race will be better that's what
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:01.680]  they say yeah that's that's what the whole eugenics movement is all about
[01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:07.320]  but my question about this is how do you know if the vaccine really worked I
[01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:12.280]  suppose they inject these children with this anthrax vaccine this experimental
[01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:17.680]  vaccine the same one they injected into the soldiers in the Gulf War many of
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:21.760]  which are suffering serious neurological side effects you know Gulf War
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:26.920]  syndrome and that's that's a big deal that's real you can't call all these
[01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:30.360]  soldiers liars they are really experiencing these symptoms but how do
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:33.760]  you know if this even works are they going to take the children inject them
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:38.080]  with the vaccines and then expose them to anthrax and find out how many live
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:43.080]  and how many die I mean how or how how would you know if it's even effective
[01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:48.440]  but I have another theory I think the measure of effectiveness is not how
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:54.520]  many lives it saves I think the real measure of effectiveness is how many
[01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:59.840]  children it injures so that they can become future customers of the
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:04.160]  pharmaceutical industry you see this is the main point of vaccines today it's
[01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:07.960]  not really to protect you from the flu you can protect yourself from the flu
[01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:12.040]  with vitamin D you can protect yourself with good nutrition with sunlight with
[01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:16.240]  basic immune boosting strategies that are very easy very safe very effective
[01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:22.480]  the point of vaccines is to make you a victim it is to trap you in the medical
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:28.000]  system so that you have kidney problems so that you have liver disorders so that
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:33.160]  you have a neurological problem that requires more treatment or cancers that
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:38.960]  require more treatment down the road that treatment pays big bucks the drug
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:42.960]  industry knows that the more kids they can get vaccinated today the more money
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:46.480]  they're going to make from those children when they grow up and become adults
[01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:51.200]  seeking health care so-called health care so and we know this is true the
[01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:55.680]  Institute of Medicine even in its report and by the way it is a pro vaccine
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:15:01.920]  organization it admitted that the MMR vaccines contain live measles viruses
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:07.400]  okay it admitted that those vaccines cause measles in some children it
[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:11.200]  admitted that there are side effects and again this is an organization that
[01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:17.920]  usually covers for the vaccine industry but now to make things even crazier
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:24.040]  check this out what where is this the media is pushing the success of the
[01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:29.440]  experimental GlaxoSmith Klein malaria vaccine but they're ignoring the deadly
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:32.820]  side effects you see yeah they're saying this malaria vaccine is a big
[01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:37.600]  success now it's all a spin story it's all a hoax it's not really a success
[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:42.720]  because you get the side effects you see yeah okay if the vaccine is effective
[01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:46.240]  it might reduce malaria by some percentage but what about the increase in
[01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:49.880]  the percentage of those people suffering neurological side effects what about the
[01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:54.560]  kidney failure what about the cancers what about the the adjuvants that are
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:58.040]  using these vaccines that cause brain damage that cause inflammation of the
[01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:02.400]  brain what about the increases in the cases of Alzheimer's down the road so
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:07.240]  you prevent maybe five percent of the malaria cases today and then you have a
[01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:11.920]  40% increase in Alzheimer's and cancer and diabetes they call that a success of
[01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:16.720]  course it's a success to the pharmaceutical industry because again they
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:22.600]  make money off the long term when you stay sick and vaccines are designed to
[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:28.840]  keep you sick we know that that's the truth that's what we're gonna keep saying
[01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:33.160]  right here on the Alice Jones show no matter no matter what I tell you what
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:37.840]  these companies crimes against humanity that's what we are dealing with all right
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:42.520]  let me get back on track with what we have going on we have coming up in on
[01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:47.480]  November 1 and I want to encourage you to get involved with this and a jaren I
[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:50.580]  hate to keep asking you to do stuff but can you bring up raw milk freedom
[01:16:50.580 --> 01:16:57.320]  writers calm and for those of you on the radio you can't see this but that's the
[01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:00.600]  website raw milk freedom writers calm it's just it's a nonprofit non-commercial
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:06.680]  website this is a site that's focused on this event coming up November 1 where a
[01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:12.160]  bunch of moms who are really fed up with the FDA's criminality of raw milk they
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:18.680]  are going to buy milk in in Maryland I believe in Pennsylvania and they're
[01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:23.000]  gonna they're gonna drive it across the state line not Pennsylvania I'm sorry
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.280]  look at the website here we go they're gonna they're gonna buy milk they're
[01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:31.480]  gonna cross the state line with it which is a federal crime according to the
[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:36.320]  FDA and then they're gonna drink that raw milk and they're gonna give it to their
[01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:41.640]  children right in front of the FDA headquarters on November 1 and you are
[01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:46.440]  invited and guess who else is going to be there Adam Kokesh from RT from Adam
[01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:51.560]  versus the man he is riding along with the moms to be part of this raw milk
[01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:55.140]  freedom writers guess who else is going to be there another GCN radio host
[01:17:55.140 --> 01:18:00.160]  Robert Scott Bell is going to be there reporting live maybe hey maybe we can
[01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:03.640]  even maybe he can call into the show here I don't know and if there's
[01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:08.000]  anything interesting going on on that day they could be arrested at the border
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.720]  they could have their vehicles confiscated they could be arrested for
[01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:15.920]  feeding raw milk to their children in front of the FDA headquarters could be
[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:23.480]  TSA agents swarming the area the time and location November 1 12 noon the
[01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:29.560]  location is the FDA headquarters in Silver Spring Maryland that's on New
[01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:33.720]  Hampshire Avenue the FDA headquarters right across the street from the FDA

[01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:28.400]  more coming up as I alluded to in the last segment we've got Liz Rietzig
[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:33.960]  coming on to join us in what fire at the bottom of the hour just a few minutes
[01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:39.160]  away talk about the raw milk Freedom Riders event taking place in just a
[01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:43.240]  few days it's happening in front of the FDA headquarters they're gonna be chugging
[01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:49.680]  raw milk there sort of like Gandhi led his people to on the salt march to go
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:54.120]  collect salt saying you know hey the British Empire cannot prevent us from
[01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:59.760]  harvesting our own salt it's a basic human right right of course it is just
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:04.160]  like the basic human right of drinking whatever kind of milk you want to drink
[01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:10.000]  or choosing what kind of food you would like to consume you know and look here's
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:15.800]  the issue on this we are not saying that we want to force everybody in America to
[01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:20.240]  drink raw milk I frankly I don't even drink raw milk I don't drink any milk
[01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:23.840]  that's just not part of my diet but if I were to choose a milk it would be a raw
[01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:27.080]  milk for sure but I just don't drink milk it's just I mean it's a personal
[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:32.040]  choice you see I believe in freedom of choice we here at Infowars believe in
[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:38.160]  freedom the freedom to choose what you want to eat and we say that American
[01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:43.400]  consumers should have the free choice to choose okay if you want the Hamad
[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:49.680]  denies pasteurized factory made hormone injected antibiotic contaminated milk
[01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:55.800]  in a plastic bisphenol a carton you you can buy that that's your choice but if
[01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:59.720]  you don't want that if you want unpasteurized unhomogenized non-processed
[01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:03.640]  non antibiotic ridden whatever milk if you want it raw if you want it fresh
[01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:08.880]  from a farm in a glass jug like the way they used to sell it that should be your
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:13.840]  choice too you see that's the difference between people who believe in liberty
[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:18.520]  versus people who believe in tyranny the tyrants say we the government we're
[01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:22.920]  going to choose for you for your safety for your own safety we're going to
[01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:27.920]  fumigate your almonds we're going to irradiate your spinach we're going to
[01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:30.720]  force you to pasteurize your milk and we're going to criminalize everybody who
[01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:36.000]  doesn't follow what we say those are the thoughts of tyrants the liberty minded
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:39.720]  people people who really believe in freedom say no we have the choice as
[01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:44.880]  long as we are made aware why not put a warning label on it if the FDA is so
[01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:50.080]  concerned that raw milk is going to be so deadly dangerous for people which it
[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:54.920]  isn't but that's their screwy line but if they're so concerned why not put a
[01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:58.480]  little warning just mandate a little warning label warning the consumption
[01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:02.960]  of unpasteurized milk may contain living bacteria well yeah we want that
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:07.480]  that's the point that's why we buy that stuff because we want it to be living we
[01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:11.040]  don't want everything dead we don't want all dead food in our bodies which make
[01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:18.840]  dead bodies you know why is the FDA crying over spilt milk so to speak it's
[01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:24.920]  it's insane they put warning labels on mercury and fish if you go to a sushi
[01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:29.040]  restaurant they have a warning there that says what warning the consumption of
[01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:34.080]  uncooked raw fish may be associated with some risk of I don't know
[01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:37.080]  contamination I don't know the exact language but they put a warning label
[01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:41.080]  on that hey they put warning labels on cigarettes warning you smoke the
[01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:46.800]  cigarette you might get lung cancer but they still let you buy it they still
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:52.400]  let you buy it and I actually agree with that I don't smoke I don't advocate
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:57.280]  smoking but I think that American citizens under the Bill of Rights in a
[01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:01.840]  nation in a in the land of the free should have the choice to buy things
[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:06.720]  that they want to consume even if those things may not be great for them for
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:11.680]  their health you know and and frankly I think smoking an actual tobacco leaf
[01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:15.120]  that isn't processed that isn't made with all those chemical contaminants like
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:19.200]  like the way the American Indians used to do it it's not that bad for you not
[01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:22.560]  compared to getting injected with vaccines that have have aluminum in them
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:26.840]  that's way worse for your health than smoking actual tobacco leaf without all
[01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:30.880]  the processed additives I mean the main reason cigarettes are dangerous is not
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:34.480]  because of the tobacco it's because all the junk they put in them I mean if you
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:39.480]  inhale smoke from toxic additives that's of course that's bad for you anyway the
[01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:44.640]  FDA lets you buy that stuff as long as it's got a label on it so why not raw
[01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:48.240]  milk so that's the whole point of the raw milk freedom riders and again coming
[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:51.360]  up in just a couple of minutes we're going to be joined by Liz Rietzig to go
[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:55.720]  over that a couple more breaking news items for you today cell phone towers
[01:28:55.720 --> 01:29:01.520]  are damaging the biological systems of birds insects and humans this is from
[01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:06.480]  activist post the electromagnetic radiation yet more research about that
[01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:10.120]  and how it's damaging animal systems remember remember that experiment where
[01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:13.520]  they put cell phones under beehives and then when the cell phone was
[01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:18.760]  transmitting a call the bees the little bee dance got all confused and they
[01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:23.920]  started going crazy and they couldn't find their food and and the colonies
[01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:28.160]  actually suffered as a result yeah electromagnetic radiation it disrupts
[01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:34.600]  biological systems more research coming out on that more knowledge of why cell

[01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:35.480]  even past the grim reaper at the CVS pharmacy yet and now I'm seeing Christmas
[01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:41.160]  stuff how about some some sleigh bells ringing in the next segment that'd be
[01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:44.760]  funny all right as promised we're going to be joining this segment by Liz
[01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:50.840]  reed zig she is the co-founder of the farm food freedom coalition and is also a
[01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:55.280]  chapter leader with the Weston a price foundation which has been a really
[01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:59.640]  important nonprofit group covering this whole raw milk food freedom issue
[01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:05.800]  remember folks this isn't really about raw milk raw milk is just the the
[01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:09.320]  traction point this is where we're gaining traction on this issue the
[01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:13.240]  leverage point you might say it's really about all your food freedom choices
[01:34:13.240 --> 01:34:16.600]  it's about whether or not you your children your grandchildren will have
[01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:21.960]  the right and the freedom to choose what they want to eat in America for
[01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:28.760]  generations to come this raw milk issue is simply the pivotal issue that is
[01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:34.920]  going to set precedent and in order to help restore and protect our freedoms
[01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:39.600]  Liz reed zig and many other people are have put together this raw milk freedom
[01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:44.800]  riders event taking place November 1 that's right a bunch of raw milk

[01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:58.320]  fighting championship episode raw milk moms versus the FDA okay Liz are you

[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:12.400]  schedule I know you've been working hard on organizing this event get moms
[01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:17.800]  together getting the press to the event can you give us an overview how's it
[01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:21.320]  shaping up now it's only a few days away what what's it looking like in terms of
[01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:25.960]  publicity and press coverage so far well we've gotten a fair amount of press
[01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:30.840]  coverage on the lead-up to the event and of course it's going to be pivotal to get
[01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:35.560]  a lot of press coverage to the day of and so it's always a challenge getting
[01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:39.360]  them out there but hopefully we will with the coverage that we've gotten so
[01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:45.040]  far you know planning it has gone wonderfully people are really stepping up
[01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:49.640]  I'm really pleased to see how many people from across the country and that
[01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:55.760]  moms especially are coming to the DC area specifically for this event it's
[01:35:55.760 --> 01:35:59.840]  wonderful well that's great to hear and I know we've got again Adam Kokesh from
[01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:04.480]  RT has said he's going to be there riding along we've got Robert Scott Bell
[01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:08.480]  from GCN radio network same same network as Alex here he's going to be
[01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:12.720]  embedded an embedded reporter I wonder if he's gonna wear a flak jacket you know
[01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:23.320]  just in case the FDA brings guns yeah exactly that's that's the deal this is
[01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:26.520]  about milk and you mentioned off your milk and cookies are they going to be
[01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:31.120]  dipping the milk in the cookies that sounds very like criminal activity right
[01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:35.800]  oh yeah we're gonna once we bring the milk from Pennsylvania into Maryland will
[01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:40.240]  drive all the way straight to the FDA headquarters in Silver Spring and there
[01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:44.400]  will meet with other families and other individuals who are there to support the
[01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:49.600]  effort and it will be passing out milk and cookies great American tradition
[01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:54.880]  wow wow passing out milk and cookies I had a little slip up there dipping the
[01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:58.880]  cookies in the milk not not the other way around but I imagine you could you
[01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:02.200]  could do a lot of dangerous things with milk there on November 1 you could have
[01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:06.520]  you could have like water guns loaded with milk you could have milk milk
[01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:11.920]  squirt gun fights that that could be an act of terrorism yeah we'll probably
[01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:17.320]  just stick to drinking it just drinking it are you gonna drink it out of a like
[01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:22.760]  an alcohol chugging bong type device is that what you're gonna do you criminals
[01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:30.160]  no actually that's a little risque for the moms involved straight up paper
[01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:35.080]  cups and milk and cookies all right so milk and cookies and this is milk that
[01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:39.680]  was milked from a cow what a few hours earlier or the date the day before what's
[01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:51.680]  what's the schedule okay so so fresh milk might still be warm in fact okay you're
[01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:55.840]  gonna have chilled milk again the website is raw milk freedom writers calm if
[01:37:55.840 --> 01:38:00.800]  you want to be part of this you are welcome to join Liz what do you think is
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:04.480]  going to happen do you think I mean is the FDA gonna just try to ignore this
[01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:09.280]  because they know this is bad press if they arrest these moms or do you think
[01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:13.360]  they're gonna actually stop everybody and say halt criminals and with your raw
[01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:17.400]  milk smuggling across state line what do you think's gonna go on well the most
[01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:21.560]  likely scenario is of course that's a try their best to just totally ignore us
[01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:27.160]  yeah and that would be fine because we're gonna have a really jolly time
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:31.720]  coming across the state line driving down 95 with a caravan of raw milk
[01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:36.480]  mothers and letting everybody know what we're doing and then going straight to
[01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:41.320]  FDA headquarters and having milk and cookies on a beautiful autumn afternoon
[01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:46.480]  so they're probably gonna try to ignore that's the most likely and if they do you
[01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:49.840]  know we'll have a great time with it afterwards in the press if they say it's
[01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:54.320]  so dangerous why are they ignoring it well that's the thing now if they ignore
[01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:58.240]  it they aren't they setting a precedent that they are ignoring serious crimes
[01:38:58.240 --> 01:39:03.760]  taking place in America didn't Max Kane another raw milk advocate or a food
[01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:07.880]  freedom advocate he I saw a YouTube video where he called the FDA and he
[01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:13.520]  tried to report this future crime and it took him like that go ahead Liz he
[01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:18.880]  reported it right to John Sheehan who is the head of some department there
[01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:25.840]  controlling milk and he left a message on G John Sheehan voicemail about it so
[01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:31.120]  it will be interesting to see how they respond or if they choose to not respond
[01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:36.440]  I want to see I want to see a Photoshop poster of Janet the Polatano with a raw
[01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:41.400]  milk mustache that says if you see something say something
[01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:46.200]  you know that's interesting too because we have those signs all over the DC area
[01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:53.480]  with a phone number oh you do okay yeah okay so if they ignore you if they
[01:39:53.480 --> 01:39:56.360]  ignore it which is likely to happen because that's what remember the TSA on
[01:39:56.360 --> 01:40:00.320]  that day that was supposed to be the opt-out day so the TSA turned off all
[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:05.000]  the scanners and then the print the mainstream media reported well nobody
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:08.040]  protested well gee I wonder because they turned them off I mean they they know
[01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:13.400]  they know how to play these games so the FDA will likely ignore you and but then
[01:40:13.400 --> 01:40:17.680]  they're saying well obviously this this is okay to do because I guess they're
[01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:22.680]  just going to selectively prosecuted right so if they can get you off camera
[01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:26.080]  behind the scenes at your own ranch then they're going to bring in the tyranny
[01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:29.240]  but if you're doing it out in public they're going to say oh that's no no big
[01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:35.520]  deal hands off right it will set a precedent either way all right well
[01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:39.600]  let's okay if the raw milk moms are allowed to drink their milk and are
[01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:43.200]  they going to have their their kids are there too right a lot of us will be
[01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:48.080]  bringing our children and giving them the milk right there even though the FDA
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:54.040]  has drawn language around that oh you're not supposed to feed your kids
[01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:59.040]  actual raw milk I mean that isn't that a that's a whole different level of child
[01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:06.800]  abuse I think well they call it playing Russian roulette okay maybe they'll have
[01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:12.960]  child protective services to greet you there on the highway take away your kids
[01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:18.600]  how dare you feed them raw wholesome milk you got to feed a microwave macaroni
[01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:22.400]  and cheese if you want the state to approve of your child's nutrition and
[01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:25.200]  hey maybe we'll have a roadside vaccination points for you right there
[01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:32.400]  too all right Liz are you up to taking some phone calls from some folks who
[01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:36.880]  might be interested they might have some comments on this guys can you fire
[01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:41.040]  that up I'd like to take some calls perhaps in the next well maybe in this
[01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:44.160]  segment maybe the next segment if you're interested in calling and you got a
[01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:50.320]  comment on this or a question for Liz call us at 1-800-259-9231 and please
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:54.240]  be on topic with this this is about the raw milk freedom riders taking place
[01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:58.680]  November 1 just coming up in a few days all these moms are going to be
[01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:03.240]  smuggling they're going to be raw milk smugglers like Han Solo and the
[01:42:03.240 --> 01:42:07.080]  Millennium Falcon he had his little smuggling compartments you might not
[01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:10.840]  know this Liz because this is a guy thing you know Millennium Falcon smuggling
[01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:14.400]  well maybe he could have raw milk in there maybe they should remake Star Wars
[01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:23.280]  with raw milk yeah you know there's a lot of parallels okay if this is a
[01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:29.040]  success what's the next step what do you plan to do after this well I guess
[01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:34.680]  it depends on what response we get if any from the FDA if they ignore us there
[01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:39.400]  definitely plans to continue this type of action it's very needed right now
[01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:47.240]  where people are directly challenging the FDA on their abuse of us and abuse of
[01:42:47.240 --> 01:42:51.880]  tax dollars and this is how gargantuan they've gotten as an agency and they're
[01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:55.800]  just stripping us all of our rights so there's definite plans to continue this
[01:42:55.800 --> 01:43:01.840]  type of action you mean again what well well first of all I want to give out
[01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:06.520]  your website farmfoodfreedom.org that's farmfoodfreedom.org so if
[01:43:06.520 --> 01:43:09.560]  you're listening you want to check that out go to that website you'll learn a
[01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:14.080]  lot more there it's up on the screen for those of you watching the simulcast on
[01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:20.200]  prisonplanet.tv but Liz I mean what what do you have against LA County and
[01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:25.200]  their expenditure of millions of dollars to hire spies and infiltrators to take
[01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:30.120]  covert video images of customers attempting or I'm sorry members at
[01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:33.920]  Raw Some Foods who are acquiring raw milk I mean isn't that a good use of
[01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:38.160]  taxpayer money? Oh it's absurd and the same thing happened here in Maryland with
[01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:44.000]  our buying club the FDA implanted an undercover spy to spy on us for a year
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:49.200]  and a half because we were getting milk directly from the farm in Pennsylvania
[01:43:49.200 --> 01:43:55.560]  and they didn't like that so your tax dollars hard at work spying on an Amish
[01:43:55.560 --> 01:44:00.960]  farmer and a few of his customers. Well you know again how dare the Amish think
[01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:04.720]  that they can subsist without government telling them what to do and what to
[01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:08.680]  think and how to act and what to buy you know how dare they all this
[01:44:08.680 --> 01:44:13.000]  independent thinking this is very very dangerous for the Empire which of course
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:17.560]  has to shove the foods down our throats that it wants us to eat I figure you know
[01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:21.040]  hey before long with all the people dying from the vaccines we might be eating
[01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:28.760]  soylent green. That's kind of a scary thought there. Yeah well hey what are they
[01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:32.240]  gonna do with with well I'm not even gonna go there that gets pretty gross
[01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:37.320]  let's get back on track with raw milk food what raw milkfreedomriders.com
[01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:42.040]  what else Liz should people know about this upcoming event or how they can
[01:44:42.040 --> 01:44:49.240]  participate in it? Well we're having a caravan of mothers going from Maryland
[01:44:49.240 --> 01:44:54.640]  into Pennsylvania getting raw milk and then driving back to Maryland crossing
[01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:58.160]  the state borders and we told the FDA where we're crossing the line so they're
[01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:01.840]  welcome to meet us there if they want and then we're going straight to the FDA
[01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:05.560]  headquarters in Silver Spring where we will be holding a peaceful
[01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:10.200]  demonstration and passing out the milk and cookies. Our request we have two
[01:45:10.200 --> 01:45:15.560]  requests with this specific event one is to change that ban on interstate
[01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:20.480]  commerce the other request is that they stop going after our farmers
[01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:26.600]  aggressively just stop there's no place on one of our independent family farms
[01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:31.440]  for guns and federal marshals there's just no place for them. Yeah they do they
[01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:35.680]  bring guns to the scene I mean they they hire they hire federal marshals and
[01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:39.640]  they hire really sort of hit squads to bring firearms and flak jackets you
[01:45:39.640 --> 01:45:43.800]  know Kevlar vests and helmets and the whole the whole get-up. The whole get-up
[01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:47.880]  and they refuse to have a conversation with us. Raw milk supporters and
[01:45:47.880 --> 01:45:52.360]  advocates have been emailing and calling and requesting meetings with FDA and
[01:45:52.360 --> 01:45:56.320]  state level health departments and AG departments for years now and they
[01:45:56.320 --> 01:46:01.000]  refuse to have dialogue with us on this. The end result is they say because we
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:05.480]  said so that's it it is not open for debate and then the FDA just refuses to
[01:46:05.480 --> 01:46:10.360]  engage except when they come on to our farms and our buying clubs and our
[01:46:10.360 --> 01:46:16.560]  co-op with guns. Well that's a that's a that's a form of conversation I mean how
[01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:19.400]  can you say they're not conversing with you when they bring it they're bringing
[01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:25.640]  you know nine millimeter rounds that's sort of a message. Well indeed it is isn't it?
[01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:29.600]  Yeah yeah yeah very much a message now this sounds really to me sort of like
[01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:35.040]  an occupy the the FDA type of movement I like that I think we should have an
[01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:39.520]  occupy the FDA kind of revolt I think we will by the way I think it'll get
[01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:42.920]  bigger and bigger down the road as more people realize what's really going on.
[01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:48.120]  I agree I totally agree and I think of raw milk is sort of a gateway food
[01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:53.360]  because once people realize the the propaganda around raw milk and they
[01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:58.440]  realize the true health benefits of it that opens up a lot of people opens up
[01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:01.840]  whole new doors that they never know existed and opens their minds to
[01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:05.640]  exploring other things that the government is telling us and lying to us
[01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:09.240]  about and and give people a whole new realization well if they can lie to us
[01:47:09.240 --> 01:47:13.680]  about milk what else are they lying to us about? Oh yeah well that's a pretty
[01:47:13.680 --> 01:47:16.920]  long list we don't have time to cover all that right here on the show. What about
[01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:21.840]  the the criticism so far I know that some of the organized trolls out there
[01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:26.640]  the the on the payroll the FDA spies the infiltrators you know the evil
[01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:31.680]  miscreants of death and dead foods they've been taking potshots at you and me
[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:36.120]  and others about this what you know what are you hearing so far what are the
[01:47:36.120 --> 01:47:39.640]  lame attempts to try to to try to shoot this thing down before it even gets
[01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:48.400]  going. Well good good well maybe maybe that's because they know your arm with
[01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:54.440]  your your milk squirt guns that you're bringing to the scene there no joke on
[01:47:54.440 --> 01:47:57.480]  that you could be arrested as terrorists if you bring that to the scene
[01:47:57.480 --> 01:48:01.360]  but I've seen cases where people are saying you know this is about saving
[01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:06.480]  the FDA has to save children's lives so it has to have food standards why can't
[01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:11.800]  we have food standards what's your response to that criticism? Well you
[01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:15.880]  know I have five little children and so I've gone through five pregnancies and
[01:48:15.880 --> 01:48:20.560]  during any of the pregnancies I could drink until a bloating in or smoke or be
[01:48:20.560 --> 01:48:27.040]  around secondhand smoke or any of these horrible choices and I have that choice
[01:48:27.040 --> 01:48:32.560]  but yet I don't have the choice to go and get fresh milk for myself and my
[01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:38.040]  children and bring it back and give it to them and you know I could feed my
[01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:43.040]  children soda pop and lollipops and fast food all day long perfectly acceptable
[01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:47.880]  in fact they would probably prefer that but yet they don't want me to choose raw
[01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:52.680]  milk all of a sudden that's the big no-no. No this is this isn't the only thing I
[01:48:52.680 --> 01:48:58.880]  I've covered cases of raw food vegans who who are feeding their children a lot
[01:48:58.880 --> 01:49:03.200]  of juice and vegetable juice and fresh juices and they get visited by child
[01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:06.920]  protective services that said well that diet's unhealthy you got to feed your
[01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:11.000]  kid junk food and you got to take them out to you know places like McDonald's
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:14.520]  which is booming in the economy now you got to feed them junk foods because
[01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:17.960]  that's considered mainstream health that's what the state wants your kids to
[01:49:17.960 --> 01:49:24.200]  eat and if you don't do that you're a bad parent, bad parent. It's pretty insane.
[01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:29.880]  We can choose these options but yet they don't want to let us choose the healthy
[01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:33.120]  options. Well but what else I mean they want to control every area of your
[01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:37.200]  child's health they want to control what you inject your child with in terms of
[01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:40.680]  vaccines what your child can drink what your child can eat what your child can
[01:49:40.680 --> 01:49:44.040]  think through public education and mainstream television I mean where does
[01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:48.560]  this end you know this is why I'm glad that you're standing up Liz and taking
[01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:52.800]  taking this fight for freedom right to the front lines. Yeah I know there's a
[01:49:52.800 --> 01:49:59.520]  whole bunch of really pissed off moms about this. Well they have a right to be.
[01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:04.200]  I mean this is a big issue well hopefully okay all of you who are
[01:50:04.200 --> 01:50:07.560]  listening maybe a lot of husbands are listening right now talk to your wives

[01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:18.800]  press coverage now I don't know the mainstream media might try to ignore it
[01:50:18.800 --> 01:50:21.680]  because they don't want you to know the truth about this they don't want you to
[01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:24.920]  have options they don't want you to have freedom they want you to be obedient
[01:50:24.920 --> 01:50:29.080]  don't think for yourself but we are going to give it mainstream coverage here

[01:55:56.720 --> 01:56:00.960]  they know everybody's disarmed like the line the line to go into airport
[01:56:00.960 --> 01:56:04.360]  security it's like it's a big juicy terror target in it okay enough of that
[01:56:04.360 --> 01:56:09.480]  let's go to Randy in Ohio Randy you're on the air go ahead Randy
[01:56:09.480 --> 01:56:15.840]  hey how you guys doing doing great man I didn't get I didn't catch your name I
[01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:20.640]  live I caught your name I didn't catch the host name but I listen all the time
[01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:26.160]  to Alex you know that the fact is what I wanted to bring up is that from the
[01:56:26.160 --> 01:56:31.360]  time my grandmother had a cow her name was bossy and from the time I was nine
[01:56:31.360 --> 01:56:38.080]  years old until I was 17 we had five gallons of milk about every I don't know
[01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:44.640]  at least twice a week that came into our house and when it was cold the winter we
[01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:48.720]  put it out on the back porch to keep it cold because we had five gallons buckets
[01:56:48.720 --> 01:56:57.000]  of it you know I drank this milk every day I would come around and she she
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:00.920]  bossy was great because she not only provided for us she provided for three
[01:57:00.920 --> 01:57:06.880]  other families but she produced about 12 gallons from my memory as a child
[01:57:06.880 --> 01:57:12.480]  how well gallon of milk a day and well how are you how are you still alive
[01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:15.600]  Randy according to the FDA man you should have you should have died a long
[01:57:15.600 --> 01:57:19.720]  time ago from that dangerous milk oh well I know I know it's terrible when
[01:57:19.720 --> 01:57:24.520]  you know what I did I I was a I'm kind of a little chemist so you know I said
[01:57:24.520 --> 01:57:29.960]  wait a minute no can I look on top of that bucket and there would be maybe 30
[01:57:29.960 --> 01:57:36.040]  to 40% of that was pure cream yeah and so I take it night skim that cream off
[01:57:36.040 --> 01:57:39.440]  when we get the gallons of milk and then I take it and put it in the blender and
[01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:43.640]  I'd uh I'd run it in the blender for about 10 minutes and you know it turned
[01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:48.160]  into nice little gold nuggets and I'd make fresh butter and then I press out
[01:57:48.160 --> 01:57:53.680]  the the buttermilk from it and you know make well right right on real honest
[01:57:53.680 --> 01:57:57.520]  food in America I'm glad yeah you're exactly right on Randy I'm glad you
[01:57:57.520 --> 01:58:05.800]  sure do you have a question for Liz no no I'm a chair because I was actually

[01:58:12.080 --> 01:58:17.560]  every day from the store that isn't nearly as natural as that yeah how dare
[01:58:17.560 --> 01:58:20.760]  you Randy I'm sorry to cut you off but we are going to break here and I want to

[02:00:19.960 --> 02:00:23.400]  Alex Jones

[02:00:29.920 --> 02:00:34.800]  show I'm Mike Adams editor of natural news filling in for Alex today and Alex
[02:00:34.800 --> 02:00:39.680]  will be on Info Wars Nightly News this evening with some interesting information
[02:00:39.680 --> 02:00:43.200]  about the TSA and now I'm going to go through some headlines and then we've
[02:00:43.200 --> 02:00:48.120]  got another guest coming up at the bottom of this hour Daniel Vitalis will
[02:00:48.120 --> 02:00:53.400]  be joining us on the subject of what we call survival not just survival but
[02:00:53.400 --> 02:00:57.080]  actually thriving through difficult times which are well upon us right now
[02:00:57.080 --> 02:01:02.880]  also going to be talking about public protests riots war in the Middle East but
[02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:09.040]  first some of these headlines Gaddafi buried in a secret desert location
[02:01:09.040 --> 02:01:14.760]  alright whatever they want to say and bin Laden was killed about nine or ten
[02:01:14.760 --> 02:01:21.600]  times and they threw him in the ocean right whatever you just don't know you
[02:01:21.600 --> 02:01:25.320]  can't trust in any of this anymore maybe he is buried in a secret desert
[02:01:25.320 --> 02:01:30.000]  location but that's just a distraction from the real issue which is that it was
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:36.200]  an al-Qaeda rebel uprising funded by globalists to take out Gaddafi and
[02:01:36.200 --> 02:01:41.680]  install another future enemy that can drive the war machine even further
[02:01:41.680 --> 02:01:46.880]  all right another news we've got a Mexican ID becomes a valid ID in Sonoma
[02:01:46.880 --> 02:01:53.160]  County all right so a California's driver's license is now acceptable as a
[02:01:53.160 --> 02:02:00.040]  valid ID of course but also now is a card issued by the Mexican Consulate yeah
[02:02:00.040 --> 02:02:06.520]  so just another way for let's say non-documented immigrants to come in
[02:02:06.520 --> 02:02:10.560]  and start collecting more benefits on the backs of the American taxpayers you
[02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:16.080]  know I this issue is something that that my position on has really changed and
[02:02:16.080 --> 02:02:20.640]  evolved over over the last few years you know as a compassionate person I
[02:02:20.640 --> 02:02:24.680]  always want to reach out and and help people who are in need but I've seen
[02:02:24.680 --> 02:02:30.960]  just this total abuse of of the American welfare systems this total abuse of the
[02:02:30.960 --> 02:02:35.720]  hospitals and the medical systems to the point where there there is Americans
[02:02:35.720 --> 02:02:40.880]  and Californians especially are paying so much money to those who are not
[02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:46.520]  legally here that it's bankrupting us okay it's bankrupting us something else
[02:02:46.520 --> 02:02:50.440]  has got to be done I'm not I'm not denying that these are these are human
[02:02:50.440 --> 02:02:53.840]  beings who deserve their their own freedom but they got a they got to go
[02:02:53.840 --> 02:02:57.000]  through the right channels they got to contribute they don't pay taxes most of
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:00.520]  the time it's all under the table and they you know the cops wave them on
[02:03:00.520 --> 02:03:06.680]  through the border patrol waves them on through most of the time it's it's a it's
[02:03:06.680 --> 02:03:12.080]  a bad situation now all right Biden says Joe Biden nobody can look you in the eye
[02:03:12.080 --> 02:03:16.640]  and tell you the stimulus did not create jobs sort of like a Clinton finger
[02:03:16.640 --> 02:03:22.080]  wagging episode I guess but Fred Lucas reports this is from Fred Lucas post
[02:03:22.080 --> 02:03:29.800]  yeah yeah it's at $412,000 per job yeah they created jobs gee why not create a
[02:03:29.800 --> 02:03:35.280]  million jobs at $400,000 each I love it when the mainstream media interviews
[02:03:35.280 --> 02:03:40.360]  people like Ron Paul and they say Ron Paul you or you would cut the Department
[02:03:40.360 --> 02:03:44.680]  of Education and you would downsize government and you would lose 400,000
[02:03:44.680 --> 02:03:49.080]  jobs and people need those jobs and Ron Paul says yeah but they're in their
[02:03:49.080 --> 02:03:53.080]  non-productive jobs and the host doesn't get it the host is like what do you mean
[02:03:53.080 --> 02:03:57.080]  these people are productive they're pushing paper around to how come they
[02:03:57.080 --> 02:04:01.440]  don't deserve their paychecks and Ron Paul has to educate them school them on
[02:04:01.440 --> 02:04:06.800]  how economies really work all right and private sector innovative entrepreneurship
[02:04:06.800 --> 02:04:10.480]  type of jobs small business jobs this is what drives the economy not government
[02:04:10.480 --> 02:04:16.240]  spending $400,000 to prop up a fake job of people who are reaching down your
[02:04:16.240 --> 02:04:22.280]  pants that's not a job that we need the con job is what that is yeah all right
[02:04:22.280 --> 02:04:27.800]  mental health screening of teens creates a crisis where none exists oh this was
[02:04:27.800 --> 02:04:32.880]  posted on our website natural news yeah just got a drug more teens now that's

[02:08:24.440 --> 02:08:29.000]  and if you're watching on prisonplanet.tv we are simulcasting there of
[02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:33.800]  course in video we've already had some great guests on we have another
[02:08:33.800 --> 02:08:38.440]  wonderful guest for you coming up in just a few minutes Daniel Vitalis will
[02:08:38.440 --> 02:08:43.160]  be joining us to talk about preparedness the things you can do to keep
[02:08:43.160 --> 02:08:48.400]  yourself safe and leading up to that and safe during the protest by the way safe
[02:08:48.400 --> 02:08:53.640]  during the riots that we think are coming that it could be breaking out in
[02:08:53.640 --> 02:08:58.040]  the near future look look let me let me set that up and explain the scenario
[02:08:58.040 --> 02:09:02.440]  that's really going on now those of you who are longtime listeners of the Alex
[02:09:02.440 --> 02:09:06.920]  Jones show you're well educated on this you know you know what's going on in
[02:09:06.920 --> 02:09:13.640]  Europe you know the EU is is about to fail especially its currency you know
[02:09:13.640 --> 02:09:17.280]  there's a lot of disruption their grease is on the brink of total bank failure
[02:09:17.280 --> 02:09:21.960]  even government failure that is not going to be an isolated event that is
[02:09:21.960 --> 02:09:28.640]  going to ripple across Europe and then really have a hard impact in the UK
[02:09:28.640 --> 02:09:36.200]  which is also on the financial brink of a major restructuring reboot possible
[02:09:36.200 --> 02:09:41.240]  collapse possible possibly yet more bailouts more trillions of dollars in
[02:09:41.240 --> 02:09:45.440]  bailouts that will be needed to keep these countries solvent and it can't be
[02:09:45.440 --> 02:09:48.600]  done forever you know you can sort of kick the can down the road for a little
[02:09:48.600 --> 02:09:53.320]  while but you can't do it forever eventually you got to pick up the trash
[02:09:53.320 --> 02:09:59.560]  using the can metaphor there and in this case the trash or the garbage is all of
[02:09:59.560 --> 02:10:03.600]  the debt that is burdening our global system and that is going to spill over
[02:10:03.600 --> 02:10:07.720]  into the United States before very long because of course it's all the global
[02:10:07.720 --> 02:10:11.240]  banking system and what do you know wasn't it just yesterday that the
[02:10:11.240 --> 02:10:15.920]  Vatican called for a new global World Bank because it said that all these other
[02:10:15.920 --> 02:10:23.080]  banks weren't behaving so how does that work tell me this so let's see the
[02:10:23.080 --> 02:10:27.680]  concentration of power in the hands of banksters and Washington crooks and
[02:10:27.680 --> 02:10:31.680]  governments it's already so concentrated that there's such crooks that
[02:10:31.680 --> 02:10:36.320]  they've made a mess of the thing and the Federal Reserve don't forget the Fed so
[02:10:36.320 --> 02:10:40.400]  now the solution is to have one big giant concentration of power in the hands
[02:10:40.400 --> 02:10:47.200]  of one group that the Vatican would support hmm it just gets better and
[02:10:47.200 --> 02:10:53.600]  better man I these these storytellers in the mainstream media and in politics
[02:10:53.600 --> 02:10:57.040]  they just keep coming up with these incredible fabrications you know it look
[02:10:57.040 --> 02:11:01.160]  it is the it is the democratization of power or the decentralization of power
[02:11:01.160 --> 02:11:06.280]  that really creates liberty and creates economic abundance as you know that's
[02:11:06.280 --> 02:11:09.920]  why we got to get the control of the money supply out of the hands of the
[02:11:09.920 --> 02:11:14.600]  Federal Reserve and back into the hands of the people in America so that so that
[02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:18.600]  it's not concentrated in the hands of a few corrupt people who are manipulating
[02:11:18.600 --> 02:11:22.880]  the system but rather it's in the hands of everybody people who work for a
[02:11:22.880 --> 02:11:26.320]  living people who save money people who invest money people who hire other
[02:11:26.320 --> 02:11:31.840]  people and create real jobs not these fabricated government jobs at $400,000
[02:11:31.840 --> 02:11:38.560]  a piece people need to read a economics 101 it seems out there it's
[02:11:38.560 --> 02:11:42.400]  incredible let me get into some predictions here I made a list of
[02:11:42.400 --> 02:11:47.160]  predictions you know when I when I prepare to host the show here I'm always
[02:11:47.160 --> 02:11:50.800]  thinking a couple of days ahead usually they give me a heads up it's not like hey
[02:11:50.800 --> 02:11:54.400]  Mike can you host it right now come in now it's usually they give me a day or
[02:11:54.400 --> 02:11:58.960]  two heads up which is really important because I need that to think about what
[02:11:58.960 --> 02:12:04.280]  what are the most important issues happening and to get to the core like a
[02:12:04.280 --> 02:12:08.840]  laser beam core of the message that needs to be shared out there from from my
[02:12:08.840 --> 02:12:12.640]  point of view and I hope you appreciate that that point of view it's coming from
[02:12:12.640 --> 02:12:19.240]  my heart I tell you but here are my predictions I see that well I wrote an
[02:12:19.240 --> 02:12:23.000]  article called the second American Revolution has begun I believe that I
[02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:27.000]  believe what we are seeing right now with Occupy Wall Street will expand of
[02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:30.840]  course it will ebb and flow it may shrink for a while then it may expand
[02:12:30.840 --> 02:12:35.640]  again it may even seem to disappear for a while until there's another banking
[02:12:35.640 --> 02:12:39.560]  crisis and then you're going to see the streets at some point I think flooded
[02:12:39.560 --> 02:12:45.040]  with protesters I think that this is going to grow and it's going to become
[02:12:45.040 --> 02:12:50.640]  unfortunately more violent and more desperate now I don't support that
[02:12:50.640 --> 02:12:55.760]  violence I don't believe in violent revolution as a way to solve problems we
[02:12:55.760 --> 02:13:01.720]  we support peaceful protests we support peaceful free speech but as you know what
[02:13:01.720 --> 02:13:06.160]  about a third of the protesters out there they are advocating violence or at
[02:13:06.160 --> 02:13:09.400]  least they they they support the idea of violence and that that's that's a
[02:13:09.400 --> 02:13:12.920]  dangerous thing because if violence breaks out you know it's going to be
[02:13:12.920 --> 02:13:18.840]  followed by guess what martial law it's my second prediction martial law and
[02:13:18.840 --> 02:13:23.680]  once they have martial law in America and I do believe that day is coming then
[02:13:23.680 --> 02:13:27.400]  they can use that they can just use presidential executive orders or just
[02:13:27.400 --> 02:13:33.120]  powers under martial law to restrict anything they want they can they can
[02:13:33.120 --> 02:13:36.120]  start having gold ownership restrictions they could even have gold
[02:13:36.120 --> 02:13:40.120]  confiscation they could have restrictions on carrying cash as we're
[02:13:40.120 --> 02:13:44.040]  already seeing or they could even make a file of reports of where you're going
[02:13:44.040 --> 02:13:49.720]  to walk today like we saw where was that it was that in Wisconsin cover that in
[02:13:49.720 --> 02:13:54.360]  the first hour just incredible where they they don't want you to walk on the
[02:13:54.360 --> 02:13:58.600]  street like a free person or even bike down the road as a free person you have
[02:13:58.600 --> 02:14:02.760]  to file they want you to file a report of where you're going to walk where
[02:14:02.760 --> 02:14:07.240]  you're going to be at every hour every minute of the day and if you veer from
[02:14:07.240 --> 02:14:10.480]  that plan then you're a criminal and you could be arrested I'm not making this
[02:14:10.480 --> 02:14:15.000]  stuff up all right this is what it's coming down to but martial law would
[02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:19.240]  give our government the pretext to be able to do all of that and also of course
[02:14:19.240 --> 02:14:25.080]  firearms confiscation because of course disarmament is a necessary step for
[02:14:25.080 --> 02:14:29.120]  tyrants to run rampant over any population as they've always done
[02:14:29.120 --> 02:14:34.040]  throughout world history and what about restrictions on food restrictions on
[02:14:34.040 --> 02:14:37.240]  home gardening that could be coming too but I think we're going to have major
[02:14:37.240 --> 02:14:41.600]  marches in the cities I think we're going to see again unfortunately violent
[02:14:41.600 --> 02:14:47.360]  clashes with some police and I'm against that again I'm totally against that I
[02:14:47.360 --> 02:14:51.400]  wish the protesters would stay peaceful I do understand that at times
[02:14:51.400 --> 02:14:57.280]  throughout human history that violence has has been justified to to fight for
[02:14:57.280 --> 02:15:01.080]  freedom like the American Revolution I I certainly understand that but that
[02:15:01.080 --> 02:15:05.760]  should only be as a very last resort to free yourself from extreme tyranny
[02:15:05.760 --> 02:15:11.000]  tyranny that is is deadly and in your face and doesn't give you options I
[02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:15.960]  think we're going to see the rise of tent cities across America as we have more
[02:15:15.960 --> 02:15:20.840]  and more homeless the the new homeless people who used to have jobs just
[02:15:20.840 --> 02:15:26.840]  recently and because the government is literally destroying the economic base
[02:15:26.840 --> 02:15:32.600]  in America literally exporting jobs overseas people are losing their jobs
[02:15:32.600 --> 02:15:38.360]  losing their homes we're going to see more tent cities I don't know set up in
[02:15:38.360 --> 02:15:43.960]  parks national parks state parks perhaps maybe set up maybe if someone will
[02:15:43.960 --> 02:15:47.640]  overrun a golf course and use those beautiful lawns for setting up their
[02:15:47.640 --> 02:15:52.040]  tent we're camping out in America today honey set up the tent on our golf
[02:15:52.040 --> 02:15:58.840]  course and we'll see what we can do starvation on the rise because of not
[02:15:58.840 --> 02:16:04.800]  only disruptions in the food supply but also also the rising price of basic
[02:16:04.800 --> 02:16:09.600]  food supplies you've got hyperinflation that is always looming on the horizon
[02:16:09.600 --> 02:16:13.840]  because the Federal Reserve continues to create new money adding to the money
[02:16:13.840 --> 02:16:18.000]  supply devaluing the dollars that we all hold and that we all have saved and
[02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:21.800]  that we've all worked so hard for they're going to devalue those dollars
[02:16:21.800 --> 02:16:28.480]  making us spend more money on the basic bread the basic salt the basic flour the
[02:16:28.480 --> 02:16:32.120]  basic foods that we need to feed our families those are going to become
[02:16:32.120 --> 02:16:38.160]  increasingly expensive it's all part of the designed the engineered economic
[02:16:38.160 --> 02:16:43.840]  destruction of America I mean how else do you explain this whole issue what how
[02:16:43.840 --> 02:16:48.280]  big of a grant was that 400 million 500 million to this this electric car
[02:16:48.280 --> 02:16:51.360]  company you know you've heard you've heard that news in the last couple of
[02:16:51.360 --> 02:16:56.240]  days a White House or a federal government grant to this electric car
[02:16:56.240 --> 02:17:02.280]  company that then decided to build its cars in was it Finland I think it's
[02:17:02.280 --> 02:17:08.880]  Finland so the government grant money going to create jobs overseas and then
[02:17:08.880 --> 02:17:13.440]  there's the attack on Gibson guitars of course where they said how dare you
[02:17:13.440 --> 02:17:18.720]  manufacture guitars using wood worked by the hands of American workers on
[02:17:18.720 --> 02:17:23.480]  American soil how dare you you have to export those jobs to Indonesia or India
[02:17:23.480 --> 02:17:27.920]  or Bangladesh or wherever they want you to send them to and not have American
[02:17:27.920 --> 02:17:31.400]  workers right here at home and of course we have all the attacks on the farmers
[02:17:31.400 --> 02:17:36.680]  trying to put farming out of business trying to destroy that entire economic
[02:17:36.680 --> 02:17:44.960]  base this is happening but the good news is there is also a rise in the
[02:17:44.960 --> 02:17:49.360]  awakening yeah that's what you are part of right now just by listening to this

[02:18:34.880 --> 02:18:38.240]  that have some benefit from that medicinal plant we are tired of them
[02:18:38.240 --> 02:18:43.640]  being raided by the federal government by the DEA we are tired of Obama and his
[02:18:43.640 --> 02:18:49.800]  administration running secret kill lists kill lists of Americans that they
[02:18:49.800 --> 02:18:55.880]  can just wipe out with no due process with no rights I mean look even if

[02:19:00.120 --> 02:19:04.600]  deserve to have a trial if they gave Saddam Hussein a trial if you can get
[02:19:04.600 --> 02:19:07.640]  Saddam Hussein a trial you should be able to give anybody a trial but no no
[02:19:07.640 --> 02:19:11.160]  more trials they just knock them off bury them in the desert throw them in the

[02:24:57.520 --> 02:25:01.080]  gonna be sharing a lot of stories and producing a lot of video reports that
[02:25:01.080 --> 02:25:04.760]  probably see on info wars nightly news because we you know we have so much in
[02:25:04.760 --> 02:25:08.360]  common about vaccines about GMOs about all these issues that matter to us all
[02:25:08.360 --> 02:25:11.840]  so we're just all part of the same team here trying to bring you messages of
[02:25:11.840 --> 02:25:18.440]  freedom and liberty and happy to do it another message by the way that we also
[02:25:18.440 --> 02:25:22.040]  like to bring you is a message of preventing disease and actually
[02:25:22.040 --> 02:25:25.600]  supporting your health and boosting your nutrition that's something that I'm
[02:25:25.600 --> 02:25:30.400]  into here big time in fact gonna bring up I just want to show you behind the
[02:25:30.400 --> 02:25:35.480]  scenes this is my jar of superfoods now obviously you can't see this on the
[02:25:35.480 --> 02:25:39.120]  radio but this is this is one of the jars of superfood that I brought here
[02:25:39.120 --> 02:25:44.100]  today I always bring a couple of quarts of superfood when I'd when I'd travel
[02:25:44.100 --> 02:25:47.560]  anywhere and especially when I do these shows yeah there it is nice and purple
[02:25:47.560 --> 02:25:52.920]  if you're watching on prisonplanet.tv this is just an
[02:25:52.920 --> 02:25:57.840]  extraordinary combination of healing nutrients it's what I drink every time
[02:25:57.840 --> 02:26:01.600]  before the show which is why I'm always in the restroom here pulling chia seeds
[02:26:01.600 --> 02:26:06.680]  out of my teeth that's the one drawback with these superfoods you're gonna get
[02:26:06.680 --> 02:26:10.880]  maybe some chia seeds in your teeth not not good to have that on camera I've
[02:26:10.880 --> 02:26:15.760]  had that before drink a bunch of spirulina smile now you're on Facebook

[02:27:09.200 --> 02:27:12.880]  know one of the things about superfoods by the way just before we get to our
[02:27:12.880 --> 02:27:16.360]  next segment here we've got Daniel Vitalis on hold joining us by Skype
[02:27:16.360 --> 02:27:20.320]  coming up and that's going to be an awesome interview but one of the things
[02:27:20.320 --> 02:27:23.120]  you need to know about superfoods is some people think well you got to be all
[02:27:23.120 --> 02:27:27.720]  or nothing no I don't I'm not like a hundred percent suit you know this I
[02:27:27.720 --> 02:27:33.080]  don't drink this this is not everything I eat and people out there if you have a
[02:27:33.080 --> 02:27:37.480]  regular diet let's say you go out and you have some barbecue one day well
[02:27:37.480 --> 02:27:41.640]  that's not going to hurt you if you add some superfoods to it because you know
[02:27:41.640 --> 02:27:46.840]  the barbecue the the the smoke from the barbecue when it when it cooks the fat
[02:27:46.840 --> 02:27:51.960]  in the barbecue meat it creates carcinogens that promote colon cancer
[02:27:51.960 --> 02:27:57.200]  but you can buffer those carcinogens by drinking some superfood at the same time
[02:27:57.200 --> 02:28:00.640]  that you're eating your barbecue now I don't eat barbecue is not my choice but
[02:28:00.640 --> 02:28:04.560]  hey it's a free country or at least I hope it is so if you want to eat barbecue
[02:28:04.560 --> 02:28:08.720]  all I'm saying is get some superfoods with it and you can help protect
[02:28:08.720 --> 02:28:12.160]  yourself from some of the negative effects of some of those types of foods
[02:28:12.160 --> 02:28:15.560]  that you might want to enjoy for your own reasons and you know you don't want
[02:28:15.560 --> 02:28:20.840]  the colon cancer it goes with it I don't blame you in fact hot dogs and beef
[02:28:20.840 --> 02:28:24.960]  jerky and sausage is all made with sodium nitrite which is a very toxic
[02:28:24.960 --> 02:28:30.600]  cancer causing chemical and the defense against that is vitamin C so if you if
[02:28:30.600 --> 02:28:34.600]  you get some let's say frozen mangoes and you blend them up in a blender and
[02:28:34.600 --> 02:28:40.920]  you drink a mango juice with your hot dog or your corn dog or whatever then
[02:28:40.920 --> 02:28:45.200]  your mango juice is going to help protect you against the corn dogs against
[02:28:45.200 --> 02:28:48.560]  the sodium nitrite in those products it's in beef jerky it's in sausage it's in
[02:28:48.560 --> 02:28:52.400]  pepperoni it's in all the processed meats by the way virtually all of them so
[02:28:52.400 --> 02:28:56.520]  drink your vitamin C with it and you will help protect yourself got a lot
[02:28:56.520 --> 02:28:59.120]  more nutritional strategies I hope we have time to share those with you later
[02:28:59.120 --> 02:29:04.280]  on we have Daniel Vitalis joining us by Skype we're all you know what we're
[02:29:04.280 --> 02:29:07.720]  almost out of time here what we're going to do is we're going to have Daniel

[02:30:10.960 --> 02:30:14.800]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've
[02:30:14.800 --> 02:30:19.880]  turned menace influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[02:30:19.880 --> 02:30:25.160]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[02:30:25.160 --> 02:30:29.680]  attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[02:30:29.680 --> 02:30:34.360]  offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[02:30:34.360 --> 02:30:38.400]  constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're
[02:30:38.400 --> 02:30:41.560]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the

[02:32:02.680 --> 02:32:07.120]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[02:32:07.120 --> 02:32:11.160]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[02:32:11.160 --> 02:32:15.080]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[02:32:15.080 --> 02:32:19.080]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:32:19.080 --> 02:32:23.640]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:32:23.640 --> 02:32:28.280]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[02:32:28.280 --> 02:32:32.040]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[02:32:32.040 --> 02:32:35.480]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[02:32:35.480 --> 02:32:39.440]  onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[02:32:39.440 --> 02:32:42.600]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[02:32:42.600 --> 02:32:46.280]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[02:33:12.360 --> 02:33:18.160]  we are going to be joined for the next at least 20 minutes probably more like
[02:33:18.160 --> 02:33:23.800]  30 minutes all the way to the end of the show here by Daniel Vitalis from
[02:33:23.800 --> 02:33:30.600]  sirthrival.com he is a an expert in primitive skills in wilderness skills
[02:33:30.600 --> 02:33:34.800]  wilderness plant identification he's the kind of guy who can find food and
[02:33:34.800 --> 02:33:42.120]  medicine out in nature and very good at it and I invited Daniel to join us
[02:33:42.120 --> 02:33:46.240]  because I've known Daniel for many years and I know the guy's brilliant with
[02:33:46.240 --> 02:33:50.080]  his information and I wanted to get his take on what's coming in America and
[02:33:50.080 --> 02:33:55.640]  what you can do to help protect and defend yourselves and be smart be
[02:33:55.640 --> 02:33:59.200]  street smart about what's coming in America so Daniel is joining us by Skype
[02:33:59.200 --> 02:34:03.440]  are you there Daniel I am good to be on the show thanks a lot great thanks for
[02:34:03.440 --> 02:34:07.920]  joining us today good good to see you there first of all first question for
[02:34:07.920 --> 02:34:12.560]  you Daniel where do you think this is all headed in terms of the protests that
[02:34:12.560 --> 02:34:16.800]  are happening right now combined with what you know a financial disruption or
[02:34:16.800 --> 02:34:20.240]  maybe collapse is headed our way what's your take on where things are headed in
[02:34:20.240 --> 02:34:23.440]  America well clearly it seems like these things are going to continue to
[02:34:23.440 --> 02:34:27.840]  escalate for a time and when this Occupy movement first began you know for me
[02:34:27.840 --> 02:34:32.000]  that was the first time in my life that I can really think of so such a
[02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:35.760]  pervasive kind of protest I never seen anything like this in my lifetime really
[02:34:35.760 --> 02:34:39.680]  I had the opportunity to be in Los Angeles recently where I saw the
[02:34:39.680 --> 02:34:43.360]  beginnings of that protest there I think we're going to see like you
[02:34:43.360 --> 02:34:46.000]  mentioned earlier in the show I think we're going to see people moving into
[02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.080]  the streets more and more and I think we're going to see more and more
[02:34:48.080 --> 02:34:53.200]  contention between sort of those malicious those militia powers those
[02:34:53.200 --> 02:34:57.360]  those people who are ready to violently uprise and I think we're going to see
[02:34:57.360 --> 02:35:01.200]  conflict with them and the police and the military I think that it's obvious
[02:35:01.200 --> 02:35:04.720]  it's moving in that direction the timelines very difficult to predict
[02:35:04.720 --> 02:35:08.160]  but I think we could expect this thing to continue on the course it's sort of
[02:35:08.160 --> 02:35:11.680]  like dominoes have already begun falling I think we can expect them to continue
[02:35:11.680 --> 02:35:15.760]  to fall well that's that's a good good analysis but I just want to clarify too
[02:35:15.760 --> 02:35:18.880]  you're not advocating that kind of violence you're just saying that you
[02:35:18.880 --> 02:35:23.760]  suspect that might be might be where it's headed I think in the same way that
[02:35:23.760 --> 02:35:27.600]  you know the people the listeners of this show are aware of the kind of power
[02:35:27.600 --> 02:35:32.480]  and force that the the police state is willing to use I think we need to also
[02:35:32.480 --> 02:35:36.080]  be aware that there are those other powers out there willing to use force as
[02:35:36.080 --> 02:35:39.520]  well and I would advocate a neutral position in that in fact one of the
[02:35:39.520 --> 02:35:42.880]  things you and I have talked a lot about Mike is how not to be part of either of
[02:35:42.880 --> 02:35:46.160]  those two things rather I'd like to create this sort of safe haven for
[02:35:46.160 --> 02:35:51.120]  myself so that I have that longevity I don't want to be caught up on either
[02:35:51.120 --> 02:35:55.360]  side of this I'm I plan to sit back and watch it happen
[02:35:55.360 --> 02:35:59.840]  watch how the the cards fall and choose a position that's safe for me and for my
[02:35:59.840 --> 02:36:04.320]  loved ones well but okay but let's say a critic watching this might say well
[02:36:04.320 --> 02:36:07.520]  Daniel you know why why aren't you willing to go on on the front lines and
[02:36:07.520 --> 02:36:11.360]  be part of the fight and rise up and be part of that I mean what's
[02:36:11.360 --> 02:36:14.720]  you know what's the deal huh are you saying you're just gonna back out
[02:36:14.720 --> 02:36:17.920]  yeah rather than back out I want to be part of rebuilding this
[02:36:17.920 --> 02:36:21.520]  this country I want to be part of rebuilding this world my focus is on my
[02:36:21.520 --> 02:36:25.120]  own health and taking care of myself and taking care of the people I love
[02:36:25.120 --> 02:36:28.560]  taking care of the people who are following my work and sharing with them
[02:36:28.560 --> 02:36:31.760]  the kind of strategies that they can use to stay really healthy and safe in these
[02:36:31.760 --> 02:36:34.800]  coming years so I'm not backing out of it at all but I'm not
[02:36:34.800 --> 02:36:38.880]  interested in the violent clash that I see a potential for
[02:36:38.880 --> 02:36:42.320]  rather I'd like to be part of rebuilding a world that we all really would like to
[02:36:42.320 --> 02:36:45.360]  live in the kind of world where we have the liberty and freedom that we talk
[02:36:45.360 --> 02:36:48.160]  about but haven't really got to experience in our lifetimes
[02:36:48.160 --> 02:36:51.520]  alright so you don't like inhaling tear gas I see okay whatever
[02:36:51.520 --> 02:36:54.640]  to each his own by the way your your camera is shaking just a little bit
[02:36:54.640 --> 02:36:58.000]  there you might be tapping on your table so you might want to watch that
[02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:01.280]  keep that keep that video steady for those of you who want to watch the video
[02:37:01.280 --> 02:37:05.040]  it's prisonplanet.tv so so Daniel then the next question
[02:37:05.040 --> 02:37:09.040]  would be if people are if people want to join the protest but they don't want to
[02:37:09.040 --> 02:37:12.560]  be tear gas and they don't want to be beaten by the police right
[02:37:12.560 --> 02:37:16.080]  not a fun day they don't want to be arrested what advice would you have
[02:37:16.080 --> 02:37:19.440]  for people who want to be there because there's a lot of energy going on and
[02:37:19.440 --> 02:37:22.000]  maybe they want to be part of the end of fed message
[02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:25.120]  in these protests they want to be there physically but they want to be safe
[02:37:25.120 --> 02:37:28.640]  in the protest what would you say to them are the tactics
[02:37:28.640 --> 02:37:32.000]  tactics and strategies to stay safe even while they're there
[02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:35.040]  well I think people really need to understand sort of the difference
[02:37:35.040 --> 02:37:39.600]  between threat level white and threat level red and the
[02:37:39.600 --> 02:37:43.440]  gradations in between because you know there was a time in my life where I
[02:37:43.440 --> 02:37:46.720]  really got to live my life on threat level white where everything felt very
[02:37:46.720 --> 02:37:49.520]  safe around me you know I don't think we're at threat level red
[02:37:49.520 --> 02:37:52.080]  right now with what's going on in the streets of America
[02:37:52.080 --> 02:37:56.560]  but I think you know it's time to be on maybe alert yellow alert even orange if
[02:37:56.560 --> 02:37:59.440]  you're going to go to these kind of protests and you need to have your
[02:37:59.440 --> 02:38:02.400]  wits about you you need to be paying attention to what's happening
[02:38:02.400 --> 02:38:06.160]  you need to be listening to your senses you got five senses feeding you data
[02:38:06.160 --> 02:38:09.120]  all the time you need to be using those to sum up
[02:38:09.120 --> 02:38:13.360]  what's going on you also want to have your eyes really open for the people
[02:38:13.360 --> 02:38:16.640]  that are being sent to these things to incite violence
[02:38:16.640 --> 02:38:20.560]  because there's no doubt that people are being sent in we often hear about these
[02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:23.920]  black clad characters being the so-called anarchists
[02:38:23.920 --> 02:38:27.920]  who come into these different kinds of protests and try to incite violence and
[02:38:27.920 --> 02:38:30.800]  try to get people swept up in a sort of mob frenzy
[02:38:30.800 --> 02:38:34.320]  you don't want to be anywhere near that so you want to keep your eyes open to
[02:38:34.320 --> 02:38:38.640]  how the police are behaving to how any security might be behaving
[02:38:38.640 --> 02:38:41.680]  and how the fellow protesters are behaving and you may want to keep
[02:38:41.680 --> 02:38:45.360]  yourself somewhat to the sidelines because getting yourself right into that
[02:38:45.360 --> 02:38:49.520]  you're really asking to get to your gas to get sort of cuffed up
[02:38:49.520 --> 02:38:53.600]  again I really do appreciate the people who are willing to go into these
[02:38:53.600 --> 02:38:56.800]  kind of struggles but that's not me and that's not what I would advocate for
[02:38:56.800 --> 02:39:00.000]  people's long-term safety and long-term survival strategy
[02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:04.720]  well just to be clear you are you are an advocate of freedom and liberty but you
[02:39:04.720 --> 02:39:09.280]  for example by being on the show you use words as your
[02:39:09.280 --> 02:39:12.480]  you know your ammo so to speak I mean you you don't have to
[02:39:12.480 --> 02:39:16.480]  be physically involved to be effective everybody's got a different role to play
[02:39:16.480 --> 02:39:21.440]  absolutely and I think one of the most effective things we could do right now
[02:39:21.440 --> 02:39:25.600]  is begin taking care of ourselves becoming food sovereign becoming water
[02:39:25.600 --> 02:39:28.960]  sovereign becoming health sovereign I don't really understand
[02:39:28.960 --> 02:39:32.800]  sort of one of the interesting things I see in the preparedness community
[02:39:32.800 --> 02:39:36.720]  and in the political communities are people fighting against this system
[02:39:36.720 --> 02:39:39.840]  but they don't have the kind of health they haven't built the health foundation
[02:39:39.840 --> 02:39:43.920]  that's going to allow them to sustain it all the way through to the other side
[02:39:43.920 --> 02:39:47.360]  that's where I want to be I think taking care of our own food
[02:39:47.360 --> 02:39:52.160]  our own water and our own medicines is far more subversive
[02:39:52.160 --> 02:39:55.920]  to this current sort of system then going out there where the sign is
[02:39:55.920 --> 02:39:59.520]  you're right I mean as long as we are tied into their systems of electricity
[02:39:59.520 --> 02:40:03.680]  their systems of water out of the tap fluoridated water no less
[02:40:03.680 --> 02:40:07.360]  their systems of of health care then we are slaves
[02:40:07.360 --> 02:40:11.120]  even if you go out and protest on the street and then you come home
[02:40:11.120 --> 02:40:15.040]  you're still filling out forms for your insurance company you're still drinking
[02:40:15.040 --> 02:40:19.360]  tap water you're still not off the grid and truly independent and truly sovereign
[02:40:19.360 --> 02:40:22.720]  like you say so you raise a good point it's it's about
[02:40:22.720 --> 02:40:26.960]  getting more sovereign and independent now before all this stuff gets worse
[02:40:26.960 --> 02:40:31.200]  right rather than than voting with our dollars to support a system that we're
[02:40:31.200 --> 02:40:35.040]  out in the street with a sign protesting against
[02:40:35.040 --> 02:40:40.400]  yeah well it also makes me wonder where where this is all
[02:40:40.400 --> 02:40:43.760]  actually headed because let's say it does get more
[02:40:43.760 --> 02:40:47.280]  let's say it expands and there there are more financial collapses and people
[02:40:47.280 --> 02:40:49.680]  start really losing their money I mean we saw
[02:40:49.680 --> 02:40:53.120]  just what was it last week I think Aaron Dykes reported on this here
[02:40:53.120 --> 02:40:58.640]  that the the FDIC is now taken on the burden of 79 trillion dollars I
[02:40:58.640 --> 02:41:01.360]  believe in derivative debt that it's going to now
[02:41:01.360 --> 02:41:04.800]  quote insure against loss was that Bank of America
[02:41:04.800 --> 02:41:09.200]  I think well the FDIC doesn't have even one trillion dollars
[02:41:09.200 --> 02:41:14.000]  okay so that defaults the FDIC is history bankrupt
[02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:18.480]  penniless well that means every FDI insured bank account in the country
[02:41:18.480 --> 02:41:22.240]  is basically totally exposed no more insurance
[02:41:22.240 --> 02:41:26.240]  I mean who's going to bail out the that the bailing out organizations they're
[02:41:26.240 --> 02:41:29.120]  bailing out the other at some point it doesn't work
[02:41:29.120 --> 02:41:32.400]  and everybody just loses their money that's not going to make people happy
[02:41:32.400 --> 02:41:36.400]  yeah people are sitting on US dollars right now are actually federal reserve
[02:41:36.400 --> 02:41:39.520]  debt notes sitting on these as a savings if they've
[02:41:39.520 --> 02:41:43.440]  managed to save anything and each day that goes by they're losing purchasing
[02:41:43.440 --> 02:41:46.720]  power I'm a huge advocate of moving your money
[02:41:46.720 --> 02:41:50.560]  out of federal reserve debt notes out of bank accounts
[02:41:50.560 --> 02:41:54.560]  and moving them into either physical assets or even things like precious
[02:41:54.560 --> 02:41:57.360]  metals so that you can protect the money that you've made I mean
[02:41:57.360 --> 02:42:01.040]  I think what's really obvious Mike what we can see is happening here
[02:42:01.040 --> 02:42:04.800]  is that people have worked and worked and worked and now they're about to be
[02:42:04.800 --> 02:42:08.480]  robbed of everything they've worked for and that is going to create that anger
[02:42:08.480 --> 02:42:12.320]  and that potential for violence that we've been discussing so I think right
[02:42:12.320 --> 02:42:15.280]  now is like we have a great opportunity right now for instance
[02:42:15.280 --> 02:42:18.960]  a person wanted to purchase something like silver well they essentially have a
[02:42:18.960 --> 02:42:22.400]  government subsidy right now on every ounce of silver they buy
[02:42:22.400 --> 02:42:25.520]  is that the cost of that metal is being artificially
[02:42:25.520 --> 02:42:29.360]  suppressed they have an opportunity right now you have an opportunity to buy
[02:42:29.360 --> 02:42:32.720]  food right now to put away water to put away the kind of things
[02:42:32.720 --> 02:42:36.960]  that it seems obvious you'll need in the in the very soon coming future
[02:42:36.960 --> 02:42:40.080]  now is a really great window of opportunity to start preparedness
[02:42:40.080 --> 02:42:43.920]  measures because right now we still have dollars that can purchase something
[02:42:43.920 --> 02:42:47.200]  and you don't want to be those people who wake up one day and realize they've
[02:42:47.200 --> 02:42:50.640]  been robbed of everything you don't have to be as angry as
[02:42:50.640 --> 02:42:52.960]  those people are going to be because you can take steps right now
[02:42:52.960 --> 02:42:57.760]  really easy steps yeah you know we we talked in fact we we filmed a
[02:42:57.760 --> 02:43:00.640]  preparedness course together that a lot of people are
[02:43:00.640 --> 02:43:03.680]  are excited about us for the rival course and in that I remember we talked
[02:43:03.680 --> 02:43:07.280]  about some of the the items that people can stock up on
[02:43:07.280 --> 02:43:10.960]  for barter items things that you might not suspect and it turned out it was like
[02:43:10.960 --> 02:43:14.880]  salt sugar coffee cigarettes lighters it was
[02:43:14.880 --> 02:43:17.840]  you know maybe not stuff that I would necessarily use
[02:43:17.840 --> 02:43:22.480]  but in terms of barter ability it's huge you know I like to think like if
[02:43:22.480 --> 02:43:25.920]  somebody put away a thousand ounces of silver
[02:43:25.920 --> 02:43:30.960]  they would be holding essentially 1000 days of paid labor from an employee
[02:43:30.960 --> 02:43:34.080]  if you think about that you know traditionally an ounce of silver will
[02:43:34.080 --> 02:43:37.360]  buy you a day's labor and if you're somebody who
[02:43:37.360 --> 02:43:40.720]  has people working for them if you run a business even a small business
[02:43:40.720 --> 02:43:44.480]  think about what it would mean to wake up one day and your dollars are moved to
[02:43:44.480 --> 02:43:47.040]  zero or to a fraction of their purchasing power
[02:43:47.040 --> 02:43:50.800]  but you then had a metal that was barterable for a day's labor every day
[02:43:50.800 --> 02:43:54.160]  or other items like you mentioned that people didn't stock away that they're
[02:43:54.160 --> 02:43:56.880]  going to crave and desire and if you had those things
[02:43:56.880 --> 02:44:00.560]  you could be in a really good position especially during a time of something
[02:44:00.560 --> 02:44:04.240]  like martial law where the ability to get those things would be
[02:44:04.240 --> 02:44:07.920]  really diminished oh yeah exactly try to get salt
[02:44:07.920 --> 02:44:12.480]  in the middle of a martial law scenario after the first wave of buying you
[02:44:12.480 --> 02:44:16.480]  know salt salt is very difficult to get on land
[02:44:16.480 --> 02:44:19.600]  absolutely and you know with salts an interesting one because we see what
[02:44:19.600 --> 02:44:22.240]  happens when a natural disaster occurs we see the
[02:44:22.240 --> 02:44:25.040]  way that the shelves are stripped of water immediately
[02:44:25.040 --> 02:44:28.720]  because people know they need that water within a couple days salt slightly
[02:44:28.720 --> 02:44:32.640]  need for salt slightly more insidious we're used to having it
[02:44:32.640 --> 02:44:36.080]  in our food we all grew up on processed food where the salt was already added
[02:44:36.080 --> 02:44:38.320]  for us we don't realize and you've mentioned a
[02:44:38.320 --> 02:44:41.920]  couple times on the show today about um india and about the way
[02:44:41.920 --> 02:44:44.720]  that they protested by harvesting their own sea salts
[02:44:44.720 --> 02:44:47.200]  well that's because they were very connected to the amount of salt they
[02:44:47.200 --> 02:44:49.920]  needed to survive the average american doesn't realize
[02:44:49.920 --> 02:44:54.960]  how critical salt is to their survival right so they put away their their
[02:44:54.960 --> 02:44:57.840]  storeable foods they put away water they put away
[02:44:57.840 --> 02:45:01.920]  gold or silver or there whatever they they put away and they forget about
[02:45:01.920 --> 02:45:05.440]  little things like salt because the truth is we've never been health
[02:45:05.440 --> 02:45:08.800]  sovereign in our generation we've never had to take care of our own health
[02:45:08.800 --> 02:45:13.200]  we've been coddled and taken care of one of the things i promote
[02:45:13.200 --> 02:45:17.600]  is a kind of sovereign self-healthcare where you actually take care of your
[02:45:17.600 --> 02:45:21.360]  own health and you learn the importance of things like salt basic things that
[02:45:21.360 --> 02:45:23.760]  you need to survive you know your grandmother knew that
[02:45:23.760 --> 02:45:27.440]  your great-grandmother knew that yeah yeah exactly right a lot a lot of
[02:45:27.440 --> 02:45:30.240]  wisdom from what you're you're mentioning here daniel and for those
[02:45:30.240 --> 02:45:33.280]  who want to learn more about daniel vitalis his website is
[02:45:33.280 --> 02:45:37.200]  surthrival.com it's just like the word survival but
[02:45:37.200 --> 02:45:41.360]  a th in there instead of the v surthrival.com and then he's got a lot
[02:45:41.360 --> 02:45:44.320]  of a lot of interesting wisdom to share with us
[02:45:44.320 --> 02:45:48.080]  let me ask you about this scenario daniel we talk
[02:45:48.080 --> 02:45:50.640]  because i talked to you from time to time we talk about what's going on in the
[02:45:50.640 --> 02:45:55.200]  world and preparedness and we had a fascinating realization
[02:45:55.200 --> 02:46:00.320]  the other day about you know when the us is bombing all these countries bombing
[02:46:00.320 --> 02:46:04.960]  libya of course they're peace bombs but they still explode
[02:46:04.960 --> 02:46:08.560]  they explode with peace yes um or in pieces i suppose
[02:46:08.560 --> 02:46:12.560]  but they're peace bombs and maybe we're going to be bombing syria soon who knows
[02:46:12.560 --> 02:46:17.600]  are bombing afghanistan bombing iraq aren't we in a sense aren't we bombing
[02:46:17.600 --> 02:46:20.800]  these countries into a crash course in survival and
[02:46:20.800 --> 02:46:25.280]  preparedness as if like their people now because they they know how to live
[02:46:25.280 --> 02:46:27.920]  without water in in the tap they know how to live with
[02:46:27.920 --> 02:46:31.680]  disruptions in electricity and the food supply they know things that americans
[02:46:31.680 --> 02:46:35.120]  don't know because americans are sitting on their
[02:46:35.120 --> 02:46:38.400]  buns watching this on cnn you know remote control
[02:46:38.400 --> 02:46:42.240]  ah isn't that funny bombs blowing up in in libya but the libyans are learning
[02:46:42.240 --> 02:46:45.600]  survival yeah absolutely learning now how to
[02:46:45.600 --> 02:46:48.880]  live on their planet in their environment and the thing is is that
[02:46:48.880 --> 02:46:54.240]  we live um in our homes which are um in a lovely way climate controlled where we
[02:46:54.240 --> 02:46:58.160]  don't have to deal with um weather at all because we live inside of sort of a
[02:46:58.160 --> 02:47:01.200]  controlled bubble and what happens is the way our organism
[02:47:01.200 --> 02:47:05.360]  works and the way our epigenome works our genetics essentially is that we
[02:47:05.360 --> 02:47:09.360]  adapt to our environment and lifestyle the environment and lifestyle we've
[02:47:09.360 --> 02:47:12.080]  adapted to has kept us in a state of what we call
[02:47:12.080 --> 02:47:16.480]  neoteny in biology which means we're adults that behave and and look like
[02:47:16.480 --> 02:47:20.320]  children like big children because we've been raised in a sort of artificial
[02:47:20.320 --> 02:47:24.160]  world you know america in the last few decades has been like a big
[02:47:24.160 --> 02:47:28.080]  um disneyland kind of theme park our homes are
[02:47:28.080 --> 02:47:32.000]  so well controlled that we never have our physiology
[02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:35.600]  challenged the people in these countries particularly these desertist
[02:47:35.600 --> 02:47:39.520]  countries that we've been bombing over there who have now living um outdoors
[02:47:39.520 --> 02:47:43.520]  in caves on the run their bodies are becoming adapted to the environment
[02:47:43.520 --> 02:47:46.800]  they're becoming very strong and very elite through that process i think
[02:47:46.800 --> 02:47:50.080]  would be wise to start exposing ourselves to a little bit more of our
[02:47:50.080 --> 02:47:53.280]  environment strengthen us a little bit because we become
[02:47:53.280 --> 02:47:56.560]  rather weak and through what we sometimes call
[02:47:56.560 --> 02:48:00.640]  eugenics but it's really um accurately called negative eugenics which is the
[02:48:00.640 --> 02:48:04.880]  degenerating of a population we've been a subject to that
[02:48:04.880 --> 02:48:08.960]  through a degeneration process we've been broken down to we're so soft
[02:48:08.960 --> 02:48:13.360]  and so easily manipulated and we actually live in a kind of state now
[02:48:13.360 --> 02:48:16.960]  where our our planet is like a foreign world to us
[02:48:16.960 --> 02:48:20.080]  most people don't even know how to go outside and survive for more than a
[02:48:20.080 --> 02:48:24.000]  couple days because they're they're like aliens visiting this planet
[02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:27.520]  rather than members of the community that is born to this planet well you're
[02:48:27.520 --> 02:48:31.680]  using some pretty uh pretty harsh words there i i tend to agree with the gist of
[02:48:31.680 --> 02:48:34.720]  what you're saying but you know uh maybe we'll take some
[02:48:34.720 --> 02:48:38.320]  collars in the next segment because you know you're saying that we're too soft
[02:48:38.320 --> 02:48:42.560]  and um we're too comfortable i i would agree with that we are too comfortable
[02:48:42.560 --> 02:48:47.280]  and i mean part of our message is that we as americans who want to be part of
[02:48:47.280 --> 02:48:50.880]  the rebuilding who want to be part of the the the movement of liberty you know
[02:48:50.880 --> 02:48:54.240]  the the expansion of awareness uh we got to be
[02:48:54.240 --> 02:48:59.680]  you're physiologically and mentally ready with preparedness with some basic
[02:48:59.680 --> 02:49:03.600]  skills uh we got to be able to survive disruptions in the food supply in the
[02:49:03.600 --> 02:49:06.400]  electrical supply and the water supply i mean i don't want to be out there
[02:49:06.400 --> 02:49:09.920]  holding a a hat and waiting for fema to come along
[02:49:09.920 --> 02:49:14.000]  and give me some government cheese you know that that is not my
[02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:18.800]  idea of of how to be a sovereign citizen absolutely i absolutely agree you know i
[02:49:18.800 --> 02:49:22.560]  think um just the way that we're born in our culture born into hospitals i think
[02:49:22.560 --> 02:49:25.440]  a little bit about the metaphor of a duckling when it's born
[02:49:25.440 --> 02:49:29.360]  that it will imprint on the first uh creature that it sees and so if that was
[02:49:29.360 --> 02:49:32.720]  a person then the ducklings will follow around the person like it's their
[02:49:32.720 --> 02:49:35.840]  mother well a lot of us the first people we imprinted on
[02:49:35.840 --> 02:49:39.760]  were doctors and nurses and whenever something scary happens we run to the
[02:49:39.760 --> 02:49:43.520]  emergency room or you know you've got the kind of people who are very um
[02:49:43.520 --> 02:49:46.960]  maybe very concerned about learning to defend themselves they want to be very
[02:49:46.960 --> 02:49:50.640]  nonviolent which is i think a wonderful ethic but as soon as something scary
[02:49:50.640 --> 02:49:54.080]  happens they call the police so that men with guns will come and protect them
[02:49:54.080 --> 02:49:57.760]  and rescue them and that is the opposite of sovereignty sovereignty is where you
[02:49:57.760 --> 02:50:02.800]  are actually self-ruling and a lot of us um can't fully grasp it because we don't
[02:50:02.800 --> 02:50:05.520]  physiologically embody it we haven't done the things that
[02:50:05.520 --> 02:50:08.880]  help to strengthen us a little bit and i'm not saying somebody has to go become
[02:50:08.880 --> 02:50:13.520]  a desert marauding commando i'm saying getting outside a little bit exposing
[02:50:13.520 --> 02:50:18.880]  yourself to the air outside to the sun outside to the nutrients that come from
[02:50:18.880 --> 02:50:21.280]  the soil in the local ecosystem where you live
[02:50:21.280 --> 02:50:24.720]  these little things start to strengthen you and give you some help sovereignty
[02:50:24.720 --> 02:50:28.720]  so that you're not totally dependent on a system that let's face it that system
[02:50:28.720 --> 02:50:32.960]  is crumbling in front of us yeah it is crumbling i don't know desert
[02:50:32.960 --> 02:50:36.640]  marauding commando doesn't sound like a bad idea to have somebody like that
[02:50:36.640 --> 02:50:41.600]  around during the collapse maybe maybe all of us don't want to be there
[02:50:41.600 --> 02:50:45.040]  uh daniel we got to go to break here so stay with us
[02:50:45.040 --> 02:50:48.320]  and for those of you who have questions for daniel call in

[02:54:28.800 --> 02:54:34.720]  show and i love the listeners of this show i love the info wars team
[02:54:34.720 --> 02:54:38.320]  because we just had an audience member out there who sent us
[02:54:38.320 --> 02:54:43.600]  a photo a photoshop photo of janet napolitano with a milk
[02:54:43.600 --> 02:54:46.880]  mustache yeah we talked about that in the first hour i actually
[02:54:46.880 --> 02:54:51.440]  i was like i wish we had a poster of janet with a milk mustache and the slogan
[02:54:51.440 --> 02:54:54.960]  underneath it if you see something say something
[02:54:54.960 --> 02:55:00.560]  be suspicious of anything this is of course referring to the raw milk freedom
[02:55:00.560 --> 02:55:04.240]  riders event that is coming up november one
[02:55:04.240 --> 02:55:07.920]  when we're going to have a caravan a caravan of moms
[02:55:07.920 --> 02:55:11.840]  smuggling milk across the border into maryland and then
[02:55:11.840 --> 02:55:15.520]  drinking it like a bunch of thugs i guess in front of the fda
[02:55:15.520 --> 02:55:18.160]  you know if they really want to freak out the fda they should just engage in
[02:55:18.160 --> 02:55:22.480]  some breastfeeding right there in front of in front of the federal tyrants
[02:55:22.480 --> 02:55:25.760]  that are really freaking about what biology milk
[02:55:25.760 --> 02:55:29.280]  they should outlaw human breast milk next what do you think daniel
[02:55:29.280 --> 02:55:33.200]  i think it's probably underway they're gonna they're gonna make
[02:55:33.200 --> 02:55:37.360]  those those glands of the human female anatomy illegal
[02:55:37.360 --> 02:55:41.280]  because they they produce the illegal terrorist milk
[02:55:41.280 --> 02:55:44.400]  yeah there's so many wonderful soy based alternatives anyway aren't there
[02:55:44.400 --> 02:55:47.040]  might oh yeah i mean you gotta love that 40%
[02:55:47.040 --> 02:55:51.760]  high fructose corn syrup in the infant formula that's my favorite with the soy
[02:55:51.760 --> 02:55:54.720]  protein extracted with the explosive chemical known as
[02:55:54.720 --> 02:55:59.440]  hexane ah lovely what a lovely lovely little diets
[02:55:59.440 --> 02:56:03.760]  we're on um okay daniel i wanted to
[02:56:03.760 --> 02:56:06.960]  it's so much to ask you about we've only got a few minutes left here uh because
[02:56:06.960 --> 02:56:11.680]  man the show the show is almost over but uh you mentioned the point to me the
[02:56:11.680 --> 02:56:15.760]  other day that i got to ask you about you mentioned that urban planners
[02:56:15.760 --> 02:56:20.320]  never planned for their cities to suffer serious breakdowns or
[02:56:20.320 --> 02:56:23.520]  disruptions and why is that a big deal
[02:56:23.520 --> 02:56:27.120]  i mean what does it what does that mean about what's going to happen cities
[02:56:27.120 --> 02:56:30.240]  well at you know as i mentioned before i mean most people are used to when
[02:56:30.240 --> 02:56:33.520]  there's an emergency they run either to the police
[02:56:33.520 --> 02:56:36.720]  or they run to the hospital these are the two places we go because
[02:56:36.720 --> 02:56:39.600]  we we often forget that we could stop and actually figure out what to do
[02:56:39.600 --> 02:56:42.160]  ourselves i think a lot of us are realizing now that we
[02:56:42.160 --> 02:56:44.640]  don't really like either of those options we want to learn what we can do
[02:56:44.640 --> 02:56:47.760]  for ourselves it's really time for the people out there to
[02:56:47.760 --> 02:56:52.080]  start developing food sovereignty and that means having a food supply one at
[02:56:52.080 --> 02:56:54.480]  home and i know that the people listening to this show
[02:56:54.480 --> 02:56:58.320]  are aware of the kind of options they have for getting long-term storage food
[02:56:58.320 --> 02:57:02.720]  but i want to point out that those foods are um those are survival foods those
[02:57:02.720 --> 02:57:06.320]  are foods for getting by but that's not how i want to live my life
[02:57:06.320 --> 02:57:10.640]  and uh long term so short term that's fantastic but i'd recommend the people
[02:57:10.640 --> 02:57:14.000]  out there start developing networks so that they have access to food all the
[02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:16.400]  time no matter what happens and that means
[02:57:16.400 --> 02:57:21.520]  really developing relationships with farmers going to your farmers markets
[02:57:21.520 --> 02:57:25.280]  learning to grow your own food or if you really want to take it to
[02:57:25.280 --> 02:57:28.480]  another level learning to forage your own food which is something i'm really
[02:57:28.480 --> 02:57:31.360]  into but developing some sort of network so you have
[02:57:31.360 --> 02:57:35.440]  food security secondly i'd say water security is going to be
[02:57:35.440 --> 02:57:39.840]  critical when water systems break down particularly in the desert of southwest
[02:57:39.840 --> 02:57:43.120]  there may be some problems for some people so you may want to put some water
[02:57:43.120 --> 02:57:47.600]  away but you might also want to develop alternative sources for water
[02:57:47.600 --> 02:57:51.040]  whether that means you have a way of condensing it out of the atmosphere
[02:57:51.040 --> 02:57:54.080]  or whether you have the ability to gather that water if you don't have a well
[02:57:54.080 --> 02:57:58.320]  maybe getting um finding a spring that's near you that's why created the website
[02:57:58.320 --> 02:58:02.640]  findaspring.com which is a database of freshwater springs that you can
[02:58:02.640 --> 02:58:06.160]  actually drive up to get your water daniel started started to cut you off
[02:58:06.160 --> 02:58:08.800]  there uh we're just about out of time and i want to make
