[00:00.000 --> 00:11.760]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.760 --> 00:19.320]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.320 --> 00:26.160]  Texas Alex Jones all right historian and of course economist Webster Tarkley
[00:26.160 --> 00:31.160]  who was just in Libya I don't know almost two weeks or longer he was just
[00:31.160 --> 00:34.280]  there a little over a month ago during bombing campaigns he was just telling me
[00:34.280 --> 00:40.680]  during the break nature was taking Tripoli like Napoleon took Moscow or
[00:40.680 --> 00:47.000]  Hitler took Leningrad and that's exactly what's going on here and
[00:47.000 --> 00:52.080]  regardless we've now entered a new Vietnam and I guess they're not gonna
[00:52.080 --> 00:56.480]  the character's gonna try to use mainly Arab trips in there but we know we're
[00:56.480 --> 01:01.120]  not getting the official story so so how do you see this ending because you
[01:01.120 --> 01:06.800]  know the media is saying what's next in Libya key to US politics AP is still
[01:06.800 --> 01:11.480]  going with the fact that the war is over others are saying look out this is a
[01:11.480 --> 01:16.800]  civil war what who was behind this we know the bankers want the 144 tons of
[01:16.800 --> 01:20.960]  gold and they want the infrastructure Webster but but I mean how do this is
[01:20.960 --> 01:26.240]  going to be a nightmare situation well remember there's a secret treaty signed
[01:26.240 --> 01:31.320]  between the British and the French on November 2nd of last year and that set
[01:31.320 --> 01:37.520]  up the overall attack on Libya operation South Mistral which is also known as
[01:37.520 --> 01:43.920]  operation harmaton and harmaton is another word for that same wind right
[01:43.920 --> 01:48.440]  that Mediterranean wind called the Mistral so this was cynically planned
[01:48.440 --> 01:52.040]  well in advance they were doing bombing drills and and and everything else for
[01:52.040 --> 01:56.360]  what we're seeing right now they watch the Al Qaeda forces they're called
[01:56.360 --> 02:01.280]  protesters and the rest is history correct and and remember that they're
[02:01.280 --> 02:06.520]  up there are vast areas of southern Libya where the writ of NATO will not run
[02:06.520 --> 02:12.640]  especially that is on province the whole southwestern part of Libya is this
[02:12.640 --> 02:17.800]  is on where most everybody is black they're Libyans they're Arabs but they're
[02:17.800 --> 02:21.240]  black so they're not going to listen to the yoke they're not going to subject
[02:21.240 --> 02:26.320]  themselves to the yoke of this Benghazi racist lynch council that we've that
[02:26.320 --> 02:32.080]  we've seen the other question is you've got these these countries chad and as
[02:32.080 --> 02:37.560]  southern Algeria but especially chad and a couple of others South Africa won't
[02:37.560 --> 02:41.560]  turn its back on Gaddafi because he's been helping the region well the
[02:41.560 --> 02:45.640]  loyalties of some of these people are not what you'd like it to be but but
[02:45.640 --> 02:51.040]  still they're there is a large area there a government in exile or something
[02:51.040 --> 02:55.800]  like that could go on for a very long time and again it's going to come down
[02:55.800 --> 03:00.440]  now to a series of tribal vendettas but on the other hand I don't I don't think
[03:00.440 --> 03:05.200]  we should get that far ahead right now Gaddafi is in the field he's defiant
[03:05.200 --> 03:11.000]  he's fighting his son Saif is leading attacks his other son Thomas was leading
[03:11.000 --> 03:15.200]  a tank attack on on the green square yesterday which seems to have succeeded
[03:15.200 --> 03:19.840]  at least for a while so I think you got to get used to a period of prolonged
[03:19.840 --> 03:28.000]  continuous warfare with constant news reports and let's not forget that the
[03:28.000 --> 03:32.320]  rebels took a bunch of cities and Gaddafi took them back but here's the deal
[03:32.320 --> 03:36.800]  they've committed Western special forces that's confirmed on a telegraph you
[03:36.800 --> 03:41.040]  name it they've committed them into Tripoli now Webster I think you're going
[03:41.040 --> 03:47.040]  to see within two or three days I think you're going to see more more Western
[03:47.040 --> 03:51.920]  forces going in and they can't now be defeated by Gaddafi with all their
[03:51.920 --> 03:55.000]  bluster I think you're going to see a full-on invasion and they're just
[03:55.000 --> 04:00.840]  committing to an absolute full-on civil war shooting gallery and a lot of dead
[04:00.840 --> 04:06.600]  Western and other Arab troops this is this is a humanitarian disaster of
[04:06.600 --> 04:11.440]  giant proportions it's a definite it's a definite possibility but of course that
[04:11.440 --> 04:16.840]  then leads to prolonged guerrilla warfare extravagant casualties rivers of
[04:16.840 --> 04:21.800]  blood right now it would be good for Russia and China or somebody with some
[04:21.800 --> 04:26.320]  with some conscience to go into the UN Security Council and immediately demand
[04:26.320 --> 04:32.440]  a ceasefire to put an end to this all foreign forces out of Libya 20 seconds
[04:32.440 --> 04:37.480]  why why isn't Russia saying something about this Russia's now in the in the
[04:37.480 --> 04:43.600]  throes of a I guess you could call it a succession or the political struggle I
[04:43.600 --> 04:50.200]  think between these Medvedev people and the Putin people and they're also the
[04:50.200 --> 04:53.880]  Russians are not not they've drawn the line I think for Syria they haven't done
[04:53.880 --> 04:56.760]  so for Libyan all right Webster thank you we're out of time we're going to come
[04:56.760 --> 05:02.800]  back with another guest on this subject and the economy Alex Jones here with

[08:42.760 --> 08:48.280]  worst on since records have been kept dating back 50 years that's the

[09:52.080 --> 09:57.440]  designed to be given to insiders continuing they're also making
[09:57.440 --> 10:02.080]  announcements about how they do want to go ahead and cut the military pensions

[10:38.880 --> 10:44.040]  industrial world even Martin Luther King's memorial was made in China a
[10:44.040 --> 10:50.360]  fitting example of what the globalist have done it's what the UN said they
[10:50.360 --> 10:56.040]  would do with the gina 21 back in 1992 when Maury Strong said we're going to
[10:56.040 --> 11:00.160]  deindustrialize the US we're going to use environmentalism to shut the United
[11:00.160 --> 11:05.360]  States off then bankrupting the population for foreign corporate occupation
[11:05.360 --> 11:09.600]  and then the few jobs that are left will be through government corporate
[11:09.600 --> 11:15.040]  welfare and basically you'll have a mercenary population that rules over the
[11:15.040 --> 11:20.360]  rest of us here in the giant prison economy and to talk about the state of
[11:20.360 --> 11:27.720]  the world is a Harley Schlinger and he again has been the executive
[11:27.720 --> 11:32.960]  intelligence reviews magazine Southwest bureau chief more than 15 years and in
[11:32.960 --> 11:36.120]  recent years he's become the national spokesman for London LaRouche's political
[11:36.120 --> 11:39.880]  action committee I always like to get their perspective on things as bureau
[11:39.880 --> 11:44.840]  chief he's written numerous articles including the savings and loan crisis
[11:44.840 --> 11:49.160]  predicting that as an investigative journalist slanger has contributed to a
[11:49.160 --> 11:53.560]  number of books published by EIR some of his research was incorporated into the
[11:53.560 --> 11:57.880]  ugly truth about the ADL Bush the unauthorized biography for example
[11:57.880 --> 12:02.160]  Schlinger himself made a run for the US Senate receiving quarter million votes
[12:02.160 --> 12:07.600]  the Texas Democratic primary he holds a BA from the University of Wisconsin and
[12:07.600 --> 12:12.200]  a MA in European history from Rutgers University where he was the National
[12:12.200 --> 12:18.360]  Defense Education Act fellow for three years LaRouche PAC.com LaRouche pub.com
[12:18.360 --> 12:23.280]  he joins us for the rest of the hour via video Skype from what Houston Texas
[12:23.280 --> 12:28.200]  and Harley thank you for coming on with us so much of what I saw you writing
[12:28.200 --> 12:32.760]  about 15 years ago 16 years ago when I first became aware of your research
[12:32.760 --> 12:39.160]  was a bit skeptical at the time but most of it has now come to pass and so I'd
[12:39.160 --> 12:43.400]  like you to give us your world view in a historical perspective and where the
[12:43.400 --> 12:48.320]  world is at this point thank you for joining us. It's my pleasure Alex good
[12:48.320 --> 12:52.840]  to be with you. The place to start is that the the system is
[12:52.840 --> 12:58.320]  melting down it's it's disappearing the attempt to bail it out is at best going
[12:58.320 --> 13:02.480]  to lead to a hyperinflationary implosion but if they don't bail it out
[13:02.480 --> 13:08.480]  there's going to be a full-scale bankruptcy starting with one big bank or
[13:08.480 --> 13:14.120]  another the banks have frozen up again we're a little bit like what Linda
[13:14.120 --> 13:19.040]  LaRouche saw in July 2007 when he said the banking system is frozen up and is
[13:19.040 --> 13:24.360]  it just finished. It took about a year before that was generally realized and
[13:24.360 --> 13:29.040]  then in the September 2008 period with the fall of Lehman and others it became
[13:29.040 --> 13:32.720]  clear that the banks had completely frozen which meant they couldn't loan
[13:32.720 --> 13:37.160]  to each other because they knew they were loaning based on worthless assets.
[13:37.160 --> 13:42.840]  At that point in September 2008 we had what was called TARP and it was really
[13:42.840 --> 13:46.560]  hammered through the Congress under threat that the whole system was going
[13:46.560 --> 13:51.200]  to collapse if we didn't do it. Now in effect they bought a little time but
[13:51.200 --> 13:58.480]  we've created anywhere from $16 trillion to $25 trillion in worthless paper which
[13:58.480 --> 14:04.600]  is backing up worthless assets and as you know there's probably
[14:04.600 --> 14:17.080]  $25 trillion dollars. Okay Harley your video Skype is breaking up if it
[14:17.080 --> 14:19.880]  doesn't clear up in a moment we're going to call your right back on the phone
[14:19.880 --> 14:28.600]  back up. Hasn't Skype cleared back up yet? Okay Harley the last 30 seconds of
[14:28.600 --> 14:34.600]  what you said was breaking up. Please repeat it. Sure we had created by
[14:34.600 --> 14:41.080]  Bernanke, Geithner and first Hank Paulson and then under Obama trillions
[14:41.080 --> 14:46.280]  of dollars to back up worthless financial assets. Those assets should have
[14:46.280 --> 14:50.200]  been cleared out of the banks. We should have had a bankruptcy reorganization in
[14:50.200 --> 14:55.960]  September 2008 and a return to Glass-Steagall regulations. Instead the
[14:55.960 --> 15:00.880]  decision was made to bail out the bankrupt banking system and we see this
[15:00.880 --> 15:04.680]  happening now in Europe where all of the banks are getting money from the US
[15:04.680 --> 15:09.600]  Federal Reserve which is I'm sure an impeachable offense by President Obama.
[15:09.600 --> 15:14.720]  The system itself is melting down. The attempt to bail it out is not going to
[15:14.720 --> 15:19.280]  work and the only remedy we have is to go back to constitutional credit
[15:19.280 --> 15:25.080]  policies starting with Glass-Steagall but the real the other point Alex is
[15:25.080 --> 15:29.960]  we've got to get rid of Obama. We can't wait till January 2013. He's committed
[15:29.960 --> 15:36.880]  so many violations and offenses and impeachable offenses that the question
[15:36.880 --> 15:42.480]  is will there be anybody with the guts in the US to stand up in the Congress or
[15:42.480 --> 15:47.240]  in the administration and remove it? Well Harley that was my next question. It's
[15:47.240 --> 15:51.840]  clear that the ruling class is is in a crisis. They're consolidating power
[15:51.840 --> 15:56.760]  through this implosion that they've engineered but at the same time the
[15:56.760 --> 16:01.440]  black hole they've created is threatening to swallow them up as well
[16:01.440 --> 16:08.840]  and we see things really getting scary. I mean basically Obama has become a
[16:08.840 --> 16:14.240]  dictator. The the office is being used by the bureaucracy and the special
[16:14.240 --> 16:17.920]  interest. It's being empowered for a dictatorship. I'm not saying he's a
[16:17.920 --> 16:23.280]  dictator himself. He's obviously an empty suit teleprompter reader but launching
[16:23.280 --> 16:26.840]  wars without congressional approval, gun control laws without congressional
[16:26.840 --> 16:30.760]  approval, carbon taxes without congressional approval, amnesty without
[16:30.760 --> 16:35.080]  congressional approval. I mean they're openly saying they now have the
[16:35.080 --> 16:39.680]  Super Congress. Do you agree that there's a move towards an end of the
[16:39.680 --> 16:43.400]  constitutional form of government? I think it's going to happen very quickly.
[16:43.400 --> 16:49.200]  They use the debt ceiling debate to create enabling legislation for a
[16:49.200 --> 16:55.040]  financial dictatorship. In a sense what Bernanke is doing is an example of a
[16:55.040 --> 17:00.240]  dictatorship. No elected official has any say over what the Fed is doing and
[17:00.240 --> 17:05.440]  it's rumored that Bernanke on Friday is going to come up with a QE3, Quantitative
[17:05.440 --> 17:09.480]  Easing 3. In fact he's already doing that through the back door with these
[17:09.480 --> 17:14.560]  dollar swap arrangements. Alex, I think this is important. Trillions of
[17:14.560 --> 17:19.080]  dollars is going from the Federal Reserve to bailout BNP Padi-Bhat,
[17:19.080 --> 17:25.480]  Société Générale of France, Royal Bank of Scotland. They got 85 billion
[17:25.480 --> 17:31.920]  dollars in just one bailout fund. So this is already going on and the
[17:31.920 --> 17:36.480]  enabling legislation, LaRouche has compared this to what Hitler did in
[17:36.480 --> 17:43.360]  early 1933 when they used the Reichstag fire as an excuse for dictatorship. Now
[17:43.360 --> 17:48.600]  we're seeing something like that in another terrorist act, more war, anything
[17:48.600 --> 17:53.080]  of that sort or perhaps riots in the United States over the hopelessness
[17:53.080 --> 17:57.720]  around unemployment and the fascist austerity measures that will be rammed
[17:57.720 --> 18:03.520]  through by a Super Congress dictatorship. You could see an excuse for that kind
[18:03.520 --> 18:07.320]  of police state crackdown with a lot of the measures already in place for it.
[18:07.320 --> 18:12.880]  And by the way, you're not just saying that this Council of 13 with the
[18:12.880 --> 18:17.080]  President heading up the Super Congress is a financial dictatorship. They
[18:17.080 --> 18:22.280]  admit that the bills will now originate out of this group and if the full House
[18:22.280 --> 18:27.240]  or Senate doesn't vote it up or down in a simple 51% vote then whatever the
[18:27.240 --> 18:32.160]  Council has already put in place becomes law. This is so authoritarian it is
[18:32.160 --> 18:39.400]  beyond textbook it is so naked and brazen and it's happening on every front
[18:39.400 --> 18:45.440]  but our republics not dying with a bang it's happening with a whimper and if
[18:45.440 --> 18:49.440]  they're getting away with this what do you expect looking into your historical
[18:49.440 --> 18:53.240]  crystal ball that they're going to try next I mean if they're getting away with
[18:53.240 --> 18:58.440]  this. Well I think the the thing you have to realize is this is super
[18:58.440 --> 19:03.720]  unconstitutional the so-called Super Congress and the real question is the
[19:03.720 --> 19:07.800]  challenge to the American people. Are there enough people out there with guts
[19:07.800 --> 19:12.880]  who will stand up and fight this? Now we're seeing elements of this starting to
[19:12.880 --> 19:16.920]  emerge. We're seeing it in the African-American population with the
[19:16.920 --> 19:20.360]  famous video of Maxine Waters although I don't know why you have to ask
[19:20.360 --> 19:24.560]  permission to negotiate with Nero you got to get rid of. You see it in the
[19:24.560 --> 19:28.720]  Hispanic population you see it with progressives you see it with conservatives
[19:28.720 --> 19:34.240]  there are very few people who are giving their consent to this government but the
[19:34.240 --> 19:38.840]  problem is that the elected officials in the US Congress and the House and the
[19:38.840 --> 19:44.400]  Senate in state legislatures all over the country have been willing to cut and
[19:44.400 --> 19:50.480]  kill for the sake of the bailout and the real issue I think we've got a face is
[19:50.480 --> 19:56.000]  either we stop the bailout with Glass-Steagall and get Obama out. I'll hardly stay there let's
[19:56.000 --> 20:00.000]  let's look at where the economy is going on its current course versus some of the
[20:00.000 --> 20:04.160]  solution. What you're about to hear are the real experiences of women over 40
[20:04.160 --> 20:08.320]  who finally lost weight by becoming hormonally balanced again. I lost 20
[20:08.320 --> 20:15.200]  pounds. I lost 40 pounds. I lost 55 pounds. I went from a size 14 to a size 8.
[20:15.200 --> 20:20.800]  Their secret is Ambron the revolutionary formula for women over 40 that balances
[20:20.800 --> 20:26.000]  hormones naturally. The leading cause of weight gain over 40 is hormonal imbalance
[20:26.000 --> 20:30.440]  until you balance your hormones losing weight can be practically impossible but
[20:30.440 --> 20:34.600]  Ambron restores hormonal balance naturally so the weight can just fall
[20:34.600 --> 20:39.520]  right off even that stubborn belly fat plus Ambron eliminates other symptoms of
[20:39.520 --> 20:44.600]  hormonal aging like hot flashes, night sweats, low libido, difficulty concentrating
[20:44.600 --> 20:48.240]  and more. Be one of the first 50 callers right now and they'll send you a

[21:29.560 --> 21:33.760]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to
[21:33.760 --> 21:37.120]  protect from counterfeit and carding to a private bank having it led back at
[21:37.120 --> 21:41.040]  interest forcing taxes to service debt. This capitalism or was Jefferson correct
[21:41.040 --> 21:44.320]  when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to
[21:44.320 --> 21:47.640]  the liberties of the people than a standing army. Hi Ted Anderson I'm placing

[24:40.600 --> 24:48.120]  Harley Slanger historian researcher is our guest via video connection alright
[24:48.120 --> 24:53.920]  Harley continuing where are we going if they don't bring back Glass-Steagall if
[24:53.920 --> 24:57.640]  they don't write off the trillions and trillions and fraudulent
[24:57.640 --> 25:01.640]  international derivatives that we've been signed on to I mean they admit that
[25:01.640 --> 25:05.600]  most of our debt is not our debt we've been signed on to the bankers Ponzi
[25:05.600 --> 25:09.320]  scheme instead they're saying cut all the entitlements but I've seen the
[25:09.320 --> 25:13.320]  numbers even if you cut all the entitlements took all the quote wealthy
[25:13.320 --> 25:18.440]  people's money who are in the US it wouldn't pay off a fraction of the
[25:18.440 --> 25:23.640]  fraudulent debt so it's a lie to say cut cut cut and that that will get us back
[25:23.640 --> 25:27.960]  solvent just like it's a lie saying giving trillions to banks three years
[25:27.960 --> 25:32.640]  ago and now again well we'll get us going let me give you an example the
[25:32.640 --> 25:38.160]  Greek government has followed an austerity regime and its GDP continues to
[25:38.160 --> 25:42.360]  shrink when you cut into the real economy the only way to get out of this
[25:42.360 --> 25:47.080]  crisis is you have to separate the illegitimate debt which is the vast
[25:47.080 --> 25:51.480]  majority of the debt from the real obligations of banks that's what Glass
[25:51.480 --> 25:55.760]  Steagall does the real obligations being deposits checking accounts business
[25:55.760 --> 26:01.680]  accounts and so on you have to protect those but you don't protect the worthless
[26:01.680 --> 26:05.920]  financial instruments that were created beginning with mortgage-backed
[26:05.920 --> 26:09.840]  securities collateralized debt obligations credit default swaps and so on
[26:09.840 --> 26:14.640]  now just to give you an example of the actual corruption which is playing into
[26:14.640 --> 26:18.960]  this there was a story in the New York Times which was like a bad mafia movie
[26:18.960 --> 26:24.200]  two administration officials Sean Donovan of HUD and Catherine Wilde of
[26:24.200 --> 26:28.360]  the New York Federal Reserve went up at a funeral of former Governor Hugh
[26:28.360 --> 26:33.000]  Kerry to Eric Schneiderman who's a New York State Attorney General Schneiderman
[26:33.000 --> 26:37.680]  said he's not going to give Bank of America a sweetheart deal to get out of
[26:37.680 --> 26:41.840]  the corruption of all the mortgage-backed securities which they sold which they knew
[26:41.840 --> 26:47.400]  were fraudulent they went to him and told him he's got a layoff Wall Street the
[26:47.400 --> 26:52.520]  administration Obama acting through these two surrogates tried to deliver a
[26:52.520 --> 26:56.840]  message to the Attorney General of New York that you will not go after the Bank
[26:56.840 --> 27:03.600]  of America and Wilde actually said Wall Street is our Main Street now that's how
[27:03.600 --> 27:08.120]  the people who are running this country running Obama actually think about it
[27:08.120 --> 27:13.440]  forget Main Street they're going to defend Wall Street now part of it if
[27:13.440 --> 27:17.680]  there is a strategy and LaRouche says look these guys are crazy they their
[27:17.680 --> 27:23.240]  main strategy is genocide destroy the nation-state and kill the population but
[27:23.240 --> 27:28.560]  if there is a strategy they actually think that if they hyper-inflate the
[27:28.560 --> 27:33.080]  banks can pay off some of this debt with cheap money but what that will mean is
[27:33.080 --> 27:38.400]  that will wipe out what's left of anybody's savings and pensions in a
[27:38.400 --> 27:43.920]  Weimar-style hyperinflation which is what Bernanke and Geithner and Obama are
[27:43.920 --> 27:49.840]  going towards once that done is done the dollar is worthless and so if we don't
[27:49.840 --> 27:53.240]  get Glass-Steagall and if we don't get back to the protection of our
[27:53.240 --> 27:57.600]  Constitution we have nothing the people of this country will have lost
[27:57.600 --> 28:02.840]  everything including our ability to fight now hardly hardly I want you to
[28:02.840 --> 28:08.040]  continue along that line but when you say they want a debt economy they want
[28:08.040 --> 28:11.880]  to reduce population I want to get into the globalist mindset from your
[28:11.880 --> 28:15.440]  research when we come back you're not just saying that they have created a
[28:15.440 --> 28:24.920]  cosmology a post-industrial one-shot policy to to basically rationalize their
[28:24.920 --> 28:31.520]  command and control demolition economy this is a corporate takeover of
[28:31.520 --> 28:35.600]  anything standing this is like a corporate Borg where everything independent
[28:35.600 --> 28:40.120]  must be destroyed to them it is a domination of everything this is the
[28:40.120 --> 28:45.720]  paper economy waging war against reality it's the Empire killing off the
[28:45.720 --> 28:52.360]  nation-state absolutely so start getting into their their mindset all right
[28:52.360 --> 28:56.040]  well and they say it we're not making this up I mean Prince Philip who many
[28:56.040 --> 29:01.000]  people think is a doddering old fool which he is but he's an old Nazi the
[29:01.000 --> 29:04.800]  Bush family the Harrowman family some of these leading families of Great
[29:04.800 --> 29:09.560]  Britain who run these international banking cartels they help put Hitler
[29:09.560 --> 29:14.520]  in power this is not something that's made up this is historical fact they
[29:14.520 --> 29:18.520]  believe that there are too many people on the planet they promote these
[29:18.520 --> 29:23.320]  fraudulent scientists who come out and talk about the carrying capacity they
[29:23.320 --> 29:27.280]  talk about the second law of thermodynamics that we cannot expand
[29:27.280 --> 29:31.760]  production to take care of a growing population and meanwhile they impose
[29:31.760 --> 29:36.680]  policies that are leading to starvation unnecessary starvation Harley slanger
[29:36.680 --> 29:41.080]  stay there let's finish up with that we can't get more into where the economy
[29:41.080 --> 29:46.360]  is going in your trend forecasting on the other side we'll be right back stay
[29:46.360 --> 29:55.080]  with us long we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the

[31:22.800 --> 31:27.560]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[31:27.560 --> 31:31.360]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to

[33:22.880 --> 33:28.040]  Biden was just praising the one-child policy in China they believe in a
[33:28.040 --> 33:34.440]  economy that destroys that feeds that for somebody to win somebody's got to
[33:34.440 --> 33:40.160]  lose and this is the economy they're selling with the death panels which they
[33:40.160 --> 33:44.720]  now admit are real and Bill Gates says kill granny we get to hire 10 teachers
[33:44.720 --> 33:50.280]  and they're selling the public on this idea the Soviets did that the Nazis did
[33:50.280 --> 33:56.800]  this the Empire sell this idea and it's their ruthless rationale and you've
[33:56.800 --> 34:01.680]  seen how as soon as we bought into this globalist system all the prosperity all
[34:01.680 --> 34:06.840]  the security went out the window so we're gonna be talking to our guest more

[36:20.360 --> 36:25.240]  your local AM and FM stations now going back to historian researcher author
[36:25.240 --> 36:31.840]  Harley Schlinger joining us via video connection from Houston Harley I was
[36:31.840 --> 36:37.760]  asking you to get into the social Darwinistic Malthusians that run things
[36:37.760 --> 36:43.680]  and where their program is going to lead us and what you are forecasting is
[36:43.680 --> 36:48.960]  going to happen not just in the US but worldwide in the next year to two years
[36:48.960 --> 36:56.240]  if things are not reversed. Well Lyndon LaRouche has a five decade record of
[36:56.240 --> 37:03.480]  forecasting and many many years ago with the launching of the environmentalist
[37:03.480 --> 37:08.800]  movement on college campuses during the Vietnam War it became clear that there
[37:08.800 --> 37:14.360]  was an attempt to limit and destroy populations. Let me just cite two
[37:14.360 --> 37:18.760]  examples of this that are official government policy one was the National
[37:18.760 --> 37:24.560]  Security Study memo 200 which was adopted by Henry Kissinger which said
[37:24.560 --> 37:29.160]  that population threat in the developing sector is the greatest threat to US
[37:29.160 --> 37:34.640]  security and the US should use any means at its disposal including food as a
[37:34.640 --> 37:40.920]  weapon to reduce populations in the developing sector then under Carter we
[37:40.920 --> 37:46.920]  had global 2000 which essentially said US overproduction US technology US
[37:46.920 --> 37:52.640]  science is a problem because it engenders cultural optimism and cultural
[37:52.640 --> 37:56.680]  optimism will lead to more people it will lead to new scientific discoveries
[37:56.680 --> 38:00.200]  and will use up the resources of the planet and therefore we have to stop
[38:00.200 --> 38:05.560]  development. Now that's what's behind the deindustrialization policy we see on
[38:05.560 --> 38:12.520]  economics they've created a global economic policy of a rule by cartels
[38:12.520 --> 38:16.520]  the Empire is really a series of interlocking cartels and finance
[38:16.520 --> 38:22.080]  insurance pharmaceuticals oil raw materials and so on who are there to
[38:22.080 --> 38:27.440]  prey upon populations to wipe out whole sectors of the human race some of these
[38:27.440 --> 38:30.800]  people are on record like you mentioned Maurice Strong I've heard you mentioned
[38:30.800 --> 38:34.920]  before they're on record of saying we the world is overpopulated when there's
[38:34.920 --> 38:39.960]  more than one billion people so what do you do with six billion we're about to
[38:39.960 --> 38:44.320]  see with the hyperinflation and with the weather problems around the world
[38:44.320 --> 38:49.720]  we're going to see food shortages that will take millions hundreds of millions
[38:49.720 --> 38:54.640]  of lives in populations that are weakened for lack of food and medication
[38:54.640 --> 38:59.960]  basically bodies become petri dishes for the spawning of new diseases and this
[38:59.960 --> 39:05.000]  is why LaRouche is saying we face a dark age which if we don't get rid of Obama
[39:05.000 --> 39:09.480]  and if we don't get back to our constitutional economic principles we
[39:09.480 --> 39:13.520]  will be in a dark age and I'm not talking 50 a hundred years from now I'm
[39:13.520 --> 39:17.920]  talking months from now because we could have an implosion of the entire
[39:17.920 --> 39:24.920]  global financial system even before September well that's what I mean to
[39:24.920 --> 39:30.640]  interrupt just to back you up that's what Ted Turner that's what the you that's
[39:30.640 --> 39:35.840]  what all of them say that it's good to be post-industrial they're selling this
[39:35.840 --> 39:39.760]  is a good thing you got a whole foods but many of the magazines for the
[39:39.760 --> 39:45.760]  trendies are how great austerity is how great it is for things to fall apart how
[39:45.760 --> 39:51.520]  wonderful all of this is I mean this is such a sickening plan to to to boil it
[39:51.520 --> 39:55.720]  down and then I want you to continue with the collapse they're designing these
[39:55.720 --> 40:00.440]  are Ponzi scheme operators that have created over a thousand trillion in
[40:00.440 --> 40:05.520]  fake derivatives they have bought the world up through fraud they're
[40:05.520 --> 40:11.080]  artificially depressing the economy to bankrupt people so that folks will not
[40:11.080 --> 40:16.960]  be upwardly mobile I mean this is this is a corporate genocide if you go back
[40:16.960 --> 40:21.400]  to ancient cultures they would go in and wipe out the nearby tribe the
[40:21.400 --> 40:25.760]  corporatists have said yeah we've stolen the world through fraud and through
[40:25.760 --> 40:32.040]  insider crony capitalism the opposite of free market we are now going to sell a
[40:32.040 --> 40:39.760]  religion of self-loathing and hating to turn people's own survival instinct
[40:39.760 --> 40:44.720]  against itself I mean this is so diabolical and it's the British
[40:44.720 --> 40:50.560]  Malthusian eugenics system adopted by the US adopted by Hitler being
[40:50.560 --> 40:58.400]  implemented by stealth yeah it is so monstrous so so so please continue well
[40:58.400 --> 41:03.800]  but you said is absolutely right this is the Hitler policy only now it's global
[41:03.800 --> 41:09.560]  and this is a 1930s style depression except global and they've already used
[41:09.560 --> 41:15.720]  up all their bullets they have created so much funny money in the last three
[41:15.720 --> 41:21.520]  years and of course it hasn't worked to create jobs it hasn't worked to deal
[41:21.520 --> 41:26.200]  with the housing crisis the new home sales are continuing to fall more and
[41:26.200 --> 41:30.360]  more people are not just out of work but we're losing skills we're losing whole
[41:30.360 --> 41:35.560]  sections of the human race but the people who believe this hate human beings
[41:35.560 --> 41:42.800]  they they think they're entitled as an imperial class is entitled to the wealth
[41:42.800 --> 41:48.640]  the sweat of the brow of the entire human race and if there are too many
[41:48.640 --> 41:52.960]  humans they've got to get rid of them call the herd is the term they use so
[41:52.960 --> 41:58.080]  this Malthusian policy is exactly what was brought in with the breakdown of the
[41:58.080 --> 42:02.800]  Bretton Woods system in 1971 and it's exactly what Lyndon LaRouche was saying
[42:02.800 --> 42:11.640]  in December of 1970 early 71 now it took a step forward with Bush following 9 11
[42:11.640 --> 42:18.040]  which LaRouche had forecast was coming as a Reichstag fire excuse it continued
[42:18.040 --> 42:22.600]  with the housing bubble it's now at a point where they can't sustain it but
[42:22.600 --> 42:28.960]  we're also seeing an explosion of wars of starvation of refugee camps where
[42:28.960 --> 42:33.440]  people are being hurted to die and we're also seeing the United States Alex and
[42:33.440 --> 42:38.240]  this is important this is why Obama is is such a criminal has to go it's not
[42:38.240 --> 42:43.600]  that he's responsible for this he's the president and he's carrying it out but
[42:43.600 --> 42:49.840]  his policy is going to turn America cities into war zones they're going to
[42:49.840 --> 42:54.760]  be there's already 40% 50% African-American unemployment in major
[42:54.760 --> 42:59.200]  urban centers this is just going to get worse if it weren't for the drug economy
[42:59.200 --> 43:03.160]  in the black economy that underlies it the underground economy you would
[43:03.160 --> 43:07.920]  already have riots and chaos so what we've seen happen in the Arab Spring
[43:07.920 --> 43:12.080]  which actually started I'm not talking about the funny business Libya but in
[43:12.080 --> 43:16.160]  Tunisia and Egypt it started because people with college degrees couldn't
[43:16.160 --> 43:21.120]  get jobs they couldn't afford to eat it's spread into Europe in Europe they're
[43:21.120 --> 43:25.200]  they're creating a hyperinflationary bubble to put to defend the euro which
[43:25.200 --> 43:29.640]  was originally set up precisely for this bankers dictatorship and in this
[43:29.640 --> 43:36.040]  country we're sitting here as Americans angry we're losing hope but the only
[43:36.040 --> 43:39.800]  hope that remains is that the American people will take the constitutional
[43:39.800 --> 43:44.040]  remedy which is called a credit policy which is the American constitutional
[43:44.040 --> 43:48.120]  system which means we have to get rid of the Federal Reserve we have to write
[43:48.120 --> 43:53.200]  down this bad debt write it off let it sit there instead of having the people
[43:53.200 --> 43:58.440]  be saddled with the debt give it back to the bankers that's why LaRouche is
[43:58.440 --> 44:02.680]  saying Glass-Steagall is not just legislation it's a principle of economy
[44:02.680 --> 44:07.320]  and just one other point on this but this debt-sealing debate was a complete
[44:07.320 --> 44:12.280]  fraud the way you deal with the debt problem is you start producing you put
[44:12.280 --> 44:17.040]  people to work you differentiate between credit which is for innovative
[44:17.040 --> 44:22.440]  technological development for the future versus payment on worthless pieces of
[44:22.440 --> 44:27.880]  paper accumulated through a casino gambling process and so we have a very
[44:27.880 --> 44:34.000]  clear picture ahead of us and I think the only question is will the American
[44:34.000 --> 44:43.120]  people find the guts to throw Obama out to cause their congressmen to storm town
[44:43.120 --> 44:47.840]  meetings to express their discontent and their anger and not just their anger
[44:47.840 --> 44:52.760]  but become thoughtful and actually express their love of humanity by saying
[44:52.760 --> 44:57.160]  we're not going to put up with this anymore well Harley that that obviously
[44:57.160 --> 45:03.360]  is an imperative the problem is you get rid of Obama they're just going to end
[45:03.360 --> 45:07.280]  up putting in a Rick Perry who's bought and paid for by the same interest or
[45:07.280 --> 45:15.400]  somebody like a Mitt Romney and if you look at these people they know people
[45:15.400 --> 45:19.880]  are starting to wake up to the private fellow reserve being the author of our
[45:19.880 --> 45:24.240]  misery that's why Rick Perry is now saying hey the fellow reserves treacherous
[45:24.240 --> 45:32.560]  why almost treasonous we see Congress's approval rating at 9% we see 11% of the
[45:32.560 --> 45:36.320]  country thinking the government's doing the people's will so certainly the
[45:36.320 --> 45:41.440]  public is awake that we're being basically robbed and cheated but they're
[45:41.440 --> 45:46.920]  not fully awake to the details so why would I mean obviously I'm for
[45:46.920 --> 45:50.960]  impeaching Obama right now for the unconstitutional power grabs but what
[45:50.960 --> 45:55.760]  about Boehner what about Reed what about this political class that has put
[45:55.760 --> 46:01.840]  Homeland Security in place not to fight Muslim extremists but from day one to
[46:01.840 --> 46:05.800]  suppress the American people if we ever tried to get control of our government
[46:05.800 --> 46:10.880]  again well let me give you an example of something that happened within our
[46:10.880 --> 46:15.520]  lifetime 20s 21 years ago in Europe where the dictatorships of Eastern Europe
[46:15.520 --> 46:20.880]  were overthrown by a popular uprising out of Leipzig in Germany out of the
[46:20.880 --> 46:27.440]  Czech Republic in Poland yeah the problem at that time was that we had
[46:27.440 --> 46:31.560]  George Herbert Walker Bush in the White House and Thatcher and Mitterrand rope
[46:31.560 --> 46:38.320]  pushed into a scheme to suppress the potential of a German reunification with
[46:38.320 --> 46:44.040]  the euro policy in the European Union now today we're actually seeing the whole
[46:44.040 --> 46:49.280]  Western world the transatlantic system in a breakdown even worse than what
[46:49.280 --> 46:53.680]  happened in the Soviet sector the American people have been bought off with
[46:53.680 --> 46:57.760]  bread and circuses with topless bars and sports and things of that sort for a
[46:57.760 --> 47:02.680]  long time but we're beginning to see an awakening now one of the things that
[47:02.680 --> 47:05.440]  LaRouche is doing and I know he's discussed this with you on the program
[47:05.440 --> 47:10.000]  is he's working on bringing into the leadership of this country a new
[47:10.000 --> 47:14.560]  generation people who don't have a stake in the system you know the biggest
[47:14.560 --> 47:18.480]  problem we have is that even many of your listeners who agree with you
[47:18.480 --> 47:22.720]  completely they still have a stake in the system it's like they're lying in a
[47:22.720 --> 47:26.600]  rotting corpse and they're saying well I still have something going on here or
[47:26.600 --> 47:29.680]  someone on the sinking Titanic was afraid to get on that's how they hold
[47:29.680 --> 47:33.280]  you hostage just interject because that's how they hold you hostage they
[47:33.280 --> 47:37.920]  devalue your pensions with currency devaluation they start cutting the
[47:37.920 --> 47:42.360]  pensions but you still take it because oh you're still getting 25% it's like
[47:42.360 --> 47:45.840]  well I better stay in the game even though they're stealing most of it from
[47:45.840 --> 47:51.760]  me even though down the road they'll steal that final little piece absolutely
[47:51.760 --> 47:56.280]  and hyperinflation will wipe it all out but what we're looking at now is there a
[47:56.280 --> 48:00.560]  lot of young people who don't have that same delusion they don't believe in the
[48:00.560 --> 48:04.160]  system they don't believe in the baby boomer generation they know the boomers
[48:04.160 --> 48:10.240]  were our have the system as their only option and so what LaRouche has done is
[48:10.240 --> 48:13.560]  put together a slate of six candidates and I've been privileged to work with
[48:13.560 --> 48:18.840]  the candidates to put forward an alternative the going back to the
[48:18.840 --> 48:23.320]  American system not accepting the corruption and the fraud and the lying
[48:23.320 --> 48:29.320]  and the killing and actually putting forward a series of proposals which are
[48:29.320 --> 48:33.240]  available people can go to LaRouche pack comm and see the videos done by the
[48:33.240 --> 48:37.400]  young people and I'd also like to give a toll-free number of people want to call
[48:37.400 --> 48:41.600]  and find out what they can do to join us with people who are out to get rid of
[48:41.600 --> 48:46.440]  Obama for example state senator Perry Clark of Kentucky but out of very strong
[48:46.440 --> 48:51.440]  statement he's a Democrat calling for the removal of Obama Keisha Rogers who I
[48:51.440 --> 48:57.880]  work with in Houston won the Democratic primary in 2010 in the 22nd district by
[48:57.880 --> 49:03.280]  calling for impeaching Obama to save NASA so we've got a movement going people
[49:03.280 --> 49:10.880]  can get in touch with us by calling 800 929 7566 this is a call to action we
[49:10.880 --> 49:14.920]  don't have much time so you can give us a call tell us you heard it on the Alex
[49:14.920 --> 49:23.160]  Jones show 800 929 7566 we have six candidates we want to recruit more we
[49:23.160 --> 49:27.000]  want to have candidates all over the country who are going to fight for
[49:27.000 --> 49:31.600]  Glass-Steagall and fight for the Constitution and not accept the lies
[49:31.600 --> 49:36.400]  that somehow you can cut your way you can kill off the elderly to get back into
[49:36.400 --> 49:41.080]  production or back into balance or you can shut down industry and have a
[49:41.080 --> 49:46.080]  recovery Obama's jobs programs more free trade haven't we learned anything
[49:46.080 --> 49:50.760]  deals with South Korea and in Central and South America to ship more of our
[49:50.760 --> 49:57.520]  jobs out I mean it is so dastardly or to have the stimulus bill for the bail out
[49:57.520 --> 50:02.320]  of the auto companies and then give them billions to move overseas it is so
[50:02.320 --> 50:07.960]  incredible when we come back I want to get into your writings on the ADL
[50:07.960 --> 50:15.720]  because the any defamation league doesn't go after real criminals what they do is
[50:15.720 --> 50:18.800]  slander people that are exposing the banking cartel and I know you've
[50:18.800 --> 50:23.280]  researched it in depth so I want to get your take on that as well then when we
[50:23.280 --> 50:27.520]  start the third hour listeners we're gonna have wide open phones on any of
[50:27.520 --> 50:31.320]  the news items any of the issues we've gotten to I've got some other important

[54:01.520 --> 54:18.120]  all right final segment with Harley Schlinger and I've read many of his
[54:18.120 --> 54:22.600]  articles over the years their analysis is excellent of the problems I don't know
[54:22.600 --> 54:26.080]  in every case if I totally agree with their solutions but in a general
[54:26.080 --> 54:30.760]  capacity it's certainly a lot better than the austerity and controlled
[54:30.760 --> 54:36.200]  implosion we're facing I've seen your writings dealing with the ADL I have
[54:36.200 --> 54:40.320]  found the ADL has been convicted of course breaking into police departments
[54:40.320 --> 54:44.560]  and stealing files no need to do that now they actually run many of the police
[54:44.560 --> 54:51.520]  departments now from your research why have you decided to focus in on the ADL
[54:51.520 --> 54:58.400]  in the past well the ADL has been an arm of the empire and in fact the original
[54:58.400 --> 55:02.800]  the origins of the anti-definition league were to defend Jewish drug pushers
[55:02.800 --> 55:06.800]  in New York City when the New York City Police Department started going after
[55:06.800 --> 55:10.840]  them and they said oh this is anti-Semitism in the case of mr. LaRouche
[55:10.840 --> 55:15.480]  as he started honing in on the International Monetary Fund the whole
[55:15.480 --> 55:20.240]  Carter administration commitment to global 2000 deindustrialization and so
[55:20.240 --> 55:25.800]  on instead of taking his arguments and trying to refute them what they said is
[55:25.800 --> 55:32.200]  oh he's running a Jewish banker theory no banks don't have a religion and in
[55:32.200 --> 55:36.120]  fact most of the people who are so-called Jewish bankers I think sensible
[55:36.120 --> 55:40.280]  Judaism the court did sacra being would spit them out would reject them because
[55:40.280 --> 55:46.200]  they have nothing to do with the teachings of Moses and Judaism but it's
[55:46.200 --> 55:52.680]  used to try and stop the debate just as today people won't address the issues on
[55:52.680 --> 55:58.200]  the banking crisis no one will talk about the trillions of dollars that's
[55:58.200 --> 56:06.120]  been handed to these Wall Street crooks and swindlers well take the ADL I mean
[56:06.120 --> 56:10.520]  take the ADL they'll defend Schwarzenegger who admittedly is a Nazi and
[56:10.520 --> 56:15.000]  tells everybody how much he loves Hitler and tells Rolling Stone that and I
[56:15.000 --> 56:18.600]  never get into racial issues or religious issues and they're always
[56:18.600 --> 56:23.520]  trying to imply I'm racist I mean I mean it's really a despicable organization
[56:23.520 --> 56:28.440]  and I mean take your group I mean it's the opposite of getting into racial
[56:28.440 --> 56:33.640]  issues and I know they've attacked you guys I mean it really is a joke that
[56:33.640 --> 56:38.560]  anybody who stands up for sovereignty is attacked by the ADL we're gonna have to
[56:38.560 --> 56:43.360]  have you back soon there's been a it says headline Fox News we'll put it back
[56:43.360 --> 56:51.440]  on screen unconfirmed earthquake it's DC capital being evacuated right now you
[56:51.440 --> 56:56.440]  can't make this stuff up man is it is this hard pit work what's your what's
[56:56.440 --> 57:03.280]  your take on that Harley well I think if you go to our web site see that we have
[57:03.280 --> 57:07.960]  a lot of material about where the solar system is in the galaxy the solar
[57:07.960 --> 57:13.200]  system goes through cycles and changes and every 62 million years or so we
[57:13.200 --> 57:17.120]  come into an area of the galaxy where we begin to see very significant changes
[57:17.120 --> 57:24.000]  in the earth's electromagnetic core in the ionosphere and what we're seeing
[57:24.000 --> 57:28.880]  with solar flares and things of that sort when a very dangerous moment for
[57:28.880 --> 57:33.880]  the earth and and mr. LaRouche has been warning about this meanwhile Obama is
[57:33.880 --> 57:38.160]  cutting the funding of scientific research into precisely these kinds of
[57:38.160 --> 57:42.480]  they cut a satellite to watch as the sun they cut a satellite to watch this like
[57:42.480 --> 57:47.400]  you know yeah a number of them and this is the only way we can develop a
[57:47.400 --> 57:52.200]  capability of looking for precursors to protect people so I think again on on
[57:52.200 --> 57:55.400]  this case and by the way notice how often Obama says well we can't do
[57:55.400 --> 57:58.680]  anything about earthquakes well maybe we could if we didn't have a treason as
[57:58.680 --> 58:04.320]  president so people again can go to our website if I can give the 800 number
[58:04.320 --> 58:11.760]  again 809297566 we're serious about getting rid of Obama now we're talking
[58:11.760 --> 58:18.040]  with people all over the country in various institutions in parties there
[58:18.040 --> 58:21.320]  are a lot of people who want them gone but say you can't do anything why not
[58:21.320 --> 58:25.280]  all right Harley the 25th amendment gives us the capability to do that sure
[58:25.280 --> 58:27.920]  Harley we're out of time we'll talk to you again in the future thank you so much

[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:27.320]  a listener that brought up the fact that I haven't covered this properly and he's
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:33.200]  absolutely right because there's so many of these cases now but out of Salem
[01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:39.280]  Oregon city shuts down cancer victims yard sale she doesn't have a job she
[01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:44.120]  doesn't have insurance she can't get insurance so she's trying to sell her
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:51.040]  belongings and they have now said that they're gonna find her and arrest her
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:56.760]  if she tries to sell anybody anything slaves aren't allowed to sell and barter
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:59.840]  everything's got to go through a big bank everything's got to be tracked
[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:03.160]  everything's got to be bought at a Walmart you're not going to sell eggs on the
[01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:06.160]  side of the road or peaches you're going to be arrested you're not going to sell
[01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:11.720]  lemonade you're going to be arrested and in DC they've been arresting children
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:16.720]  and others that try to sell lemonade or anything else and so that's why a group
[01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:22.440]  of activists went out and the videos on info wars dot com arrested for selling
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:27.320]  10 cent lemonade at the Washington Capitol and they're just out in the
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:32.200]  middle of the park they're selling lemonade and you see SWAT teams with
[01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:36.080]  their binoculars acting like with some of bin Laden has been found they're
[01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:40.600]  going to find him over at the Pentagon boys along with him or a lucky and they
[01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:46.360]  come over with police freak out and arrest them and the police are freaking
[01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:52.840]  out they are so upset that the slaves are doing this now the cops love their
[01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:57.080]  pensions that are going to be taken and devalued by hyperinflation down to
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:10:01.600]  nothing they love the cancer viruses in the vaccines they love the fluoride they
[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:05.440]  drink in their water they love it they love the authority and so they're going
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:11.720]  to get it you're going to get everything you ever wanted okay total collapse
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:16.600]  total depression but you'll still get to act tough and waddle around and deal
[01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:22.080]  narcotics to people so both of those videos are up at info wars calm and
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:27.040]  prison planet calm city shuts down cancer victims yard sale and they're
[01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:32.640]  telling the police don't really respond to major crimes in many cities like
[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:37.680]  Oakland where they don't respond to 35 major crimes go out and revenue
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:44.000]  generate and if a cop complains you're fired okay we're here to raise money
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.960]  that's it and they tell the cops keep raising money you won't lose your job
[01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:51.880]  or you won't get your pay cut but in the end you're gonna lose everything you
[01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:55.840]  see cuz you made a deal with the devil and you went along with it and the same
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:59.920]  thing for the bureaucrats and the defense contractors and all of you who
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:06.400]  let us get to this point all of you who who sold out and decided corruption was
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:12.320]  okay well now we have sown the wind we're gonna reap the whirlwind Jan Klein
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:16.320]  was holding yard sales each weekend in her backyard to raise money to pay her
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:20.040]  medical bills but the city of Salem shut her down after a neighbor complained
[01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:26.560]  ah good good Stasi a city ordinance prohibits people from holding more than
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:31.120]  three yard sales a year the city has the ordinance because it says in the past
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:35.240]  people had set up flea market-style sales on their property these story
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:38.840]  galvanized people who were outraged at the city wouldn't make an exception how
[01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:42.600]  about freedom how about if you want to go somewhere where you're not allowed to
[01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:48.120]  have yard sales you go and move into one of these little Nazi homeowners
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:53.720]  associations which almost always have corruption and money stealing going on
[01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:59.320]  in them go go do that but but people live in regular houses they should have
[01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:02.480]  their own rights the city ordinances where you can't have gardens or you
[01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:06.800]  can't have garage sales baloney and now they're annexing rural areas and pulling
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:10.080]  up in front old farmers houses saying get rid of those old tractors and those
[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:13.840]  old junk cars and the old lady your old man looks at him and says sonny get out
[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:18.360]  of here then the old man you've seen the cases doesn't pay the fines he holds
[01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:22.120]  himself up in the house the SWAT team comes and shoots him and then goes out
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:27.120]  and has beers afterwards that's what men do they kill old veterans now that's how
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:31.680]  things operate here these are real tough guys here you know they like to kill
[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:34.840]  Americans and they do and they will kill more don't worry
[01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:39.040]  meanwhile the big mega banks can steal tens of trillions of dollars and get in
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:43.360]  zero trouble major mega banks can wander hundreds of billions of dollars a
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:47.840]  year publicly no one gets in trouble came out last week what we already knew you
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:52.920]  know the Bernie Madoff situation insiders for 11 years gave the SEC the
[01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:59.280]  Securities and Exchange Commission total dossiers on what Madoff was doing and
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:04.520]  nothing was done except for having the dossiers destroyed now it turns out in
[01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:09.840]  thousands of insider reports of corruptions oh yeah back it up the evil
[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:15.960]  eliminate sales people were trying to get all the officer got them good good
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:19.400]  good good and if you try to have a yard sale he's gonna get you try to sell
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:25.000]  tomatoes he's gonna get you all over the country it's not just not just at a
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:30.080]  park you know 400 yards away from the supreme rulers you know the people's
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:36.680]  park oh look at him patting her down yes patting the terrorists down they'll
[01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:41.960]  show you meanwhile Obama just violated federal law and legalized 300,000
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:46.360]  illegals who are being held for deportation deportation is over the
[01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:53.960]  migra no longer exist haha and the law no longer exist only general electric and
[01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:57.880]  two other companies are exempt to keep their power plants open all others are
[01:13:57.880 --> 01:14:01.840]  to be shut down you'll now have rolling blackouts and massive power increased
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:06.200]  prices but so what it's all part of the fun war is without congressional
[01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:12.000]  approval gun control without laws the great time of evil is here oh and don't
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.440]  think you're gonna vote out Obama and the next puppets gonna save you oh no
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:20.960]  I'm afraid it's going to only get worse unless you elect Iran Paul who's never
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:24.600]  compromised and who has identified the exact problem and been proven right
[01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:28.600]  that's why the whole system is against him Republican Democrat pundits across
[01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:35.000]  the board to research shows less media coverage than any other candidate because
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.680]  they're scared but they're not gonna really criticize except for the
[01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:42.880]  White House to do it to elevate him Rick Perry saying that the Fed is almost
[01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:48.080]  treasonous no those that go along with the ones that are treasonous it's a
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:52.400]  foreign entity it's doing what foreign corporate entities do it's taking over
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:57.800]  it's it's it's had a corporate takeover of America and the cops know about
[01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:02.280]  football scores and how to act tough and how to get a handout on the side when
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:08.360]  they turn their turn their blind eye it's got to feel good to be these cops in
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:11.640]  these corrupt cities where they literally got their bellies hanging out the

[01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:26.200]  developing IBM gets another 21 million to develop neural net ICs IBM has received
[01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:32.480]  21 million for its synapse project to develop neural networking chips it
[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:38.840]  brings the total funding for the project to 41 million since 2008 IBM has made two
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:47.480]  prototype neural net ICs each with 256 neuron nodes which in one chip connect to
[01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:56.760]  262 144 synapse type memories and in the other chip connect to 65k synapses they're
[01:24:56.760 --> 01:25:01.720]  trying to create an artificial humanoid brain and of course much of this they
[01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:09.720]  admit is for implantation into humans they were fabricated using 45 NM SOI COM

[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.680]  don't they're not going to need humans pretty soon for their military the
[01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:38.200]  globalist military they're already converting everything over to drones in
[01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:44.200]  the air and soon on the ground that's why the elites all write publications
[01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:47.520]  saying they don't need us anymore
[01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:55.880]  does the future need a bunch of arrested development TV watchers who have no
[01:25:55.880 --> 01:26:00.520]  idea what time it is well I'm here to warn everybody and maybe folks want to
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:06.480]  listen it's a fact that most major vaccines that are tested are filled with
[01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:10.480]  live cancer viruses you might enjoy the fact that cancer is exploding you might
[01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:14.960]  like being murdered think it's cute I don't I'm an extremist I'm a weirdo

[01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:28.080]  Carolina thanks for holding thanks Alex how are you doing today I'm doing all
[01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:36.440]  right sir I have two issues for you one I keep getting on the rush radio
[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:44.040]  show in Greensboro and Raleigh I debated the talk show host there I forget what
[01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:47.960]  her name was Demetria I believe and we're discussing
[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:53.320]  Kalen how she's wanting to go into into the election if she's gonna do it or if
[01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:59.920]  not and the thing about her was she was saying that voters were stupid and then
[01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:07.400]  she said well between these four candidates Sarah Palin Bachman Perry and
[01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:13.040]  some other one she didn't even mention Ron Paul I decided sir sir that's the
[01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:18.440]  talking point everywhere they're told to do this or they're weak-minded and see
[01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:22.040]  the mainstream media not doing it so they go oh I want to be establishment
[01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:27.640]  they say we can't talk about him why he's only the leader number one number two
[01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:32.040]  or number three anyway you slice it he's a key front-runner and he's been right
[01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:36.280]  about everything let's just again they get into the petty power trip of keeping
[01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:42.440]  info from people they enjoy playing like their globalist controllers it was
[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:47.680]  really funny Alex when I mentioned well Ron Paul the constant guest on Alex
[01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:54.760]  Jones of info wars.com and he's always right and so is Ron Paul and the
[01:27:54.760 --> 01:28:01.240]  since I said your name on there they started oh it was hilarious but anyway
[01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:05.280]  I wanted to thank you for waking me up and thank you for what you're doing well
[01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:13.600]  thank you so much sir I appreciate you calling I've studied history I haven't
[01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:19.120]  lived through Soviet occupation or Nazi brutalization or Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:24.520]  and Cambodia or the hundreds of other examples but I've studied it and let me
[01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:29.080]  tell you there's no doubt the globalists want to break America forever
[01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:35.200]  they want to really bring in a hardcore tyranny not a soft tyranny and they
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:41.400]  want arrest and purges and persecutions and all the civil wars that come with
[01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:45.760]  that just like what they're doing in Libya they want destabilization they'll
[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:51.400]  sit back let us have a war with each other for years in a deep depression and
[01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:55.760]  out of it they believe from their studies that they're going to have the
[01:28:55.760 --> 01:29:00.800]  central government come out on top and a type of 21st century reconstruction and
[01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:07.080]  out of it a metamorphosized America they cut off the food and water and
[01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:20.160]  electricity for long enough the the tyranny gets bad enough they think that
[01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:26.440]  you're going to break they think that you're going to give in to whatever they
[01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:31.520]  say that's why they work so hard to eradicate any type of barter any type
[01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:36.200]  of gardens any type of lemonade stands girl scouts they don't want you they
[01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:40.600]  want to extinguish the practice of people meeting at the town square and the
[01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:43.600]  old days that's what the town squares where the open markets were they want
[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:48.160]  to make you go to the big box stores to buy the Chinese slave goods everything

[01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:40.760]  is the wages of their new world order of their globalism Obama has announced
[01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:45.280]  an acceleration of policies have already caused a massive increase in power
[01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:50.960]  prices in the last three years rolling blackouts general electric is exempt from
[01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:57.800]  all the new policies they were issued that waiver in February so we have
[01:37:57.800 --> 01:38:02.640]  those reports they're now announcing massive energy rate hikes and that yes
[01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:06.560]  you will have rolling blackouts but after all it's for the earth so it's all
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:12.560]  about artificial scarcity making you pay a lot more for a lot less this is what
[01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:17.960]  it's like to live in Venezuela or to live in Chalcescu's Romania or in North
[01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:23.000]  Korea this is what it's like you're an insider you get waivers from the
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:29.680]  government healthcare mandate you're an insider your power plant stays open gun
[01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:35.560]  laws without having a law wars without congressional approval 300,000
[01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:40.120]  illegals the president says I'm just going to release him maybe I'll keep a
[01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:44.560]  few felons back I don't need Congress I'll violate federal immigration law we
[01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:48.680]  are entering a time of complete lawlessness because the globalists have
[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:53.000]  imploded us by design and they've got to bring in a tyranny or they're all
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:57.200]  going to go to prison came out the SEC last week even the Associated Press
[01:38:57.200 --> 01:39:00.880]  reported destroyed thousands of documents and hundreds of investigations
[01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:06.240]  people bring them evidence of fraud inside the good old boy club the
[01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:10.240]  organized crime the offshore banks that run this country in Wall Street they're
[01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:14.920]  exempt you want to sell lemonade you're going to get your wrist broken you're
[01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:20.120]  going to prison you're going to jail you're almost selling neighbor's cheese
[01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:25.880]  one-year million-dollar investigation to act like it's illegal
[01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:30.560]  Gerald Solente joins us as America becomes North Korea and as they openly
[01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:34.040]  call to start censoring the internet and shut down most the cell phones in
[01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:38.360]  area San Francisco because a peaceful protest was happening it's unbelievable
[01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:43.840]  so much is going on Gerald Solente is our guest will be with us for 20 minutes
[01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:48.280]  of the next hours of the next 45 minutes trends research calm he is an
[01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:51.840]  American trends forecaster publisher of the trends journal business consultant
[01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:55.360]  and author who makes predictions about global financial markets at other
[01:39:55.360 --> 01:40:00.320]  events of historical importance and he's described himself as a political
[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:04.120]  atheist and a citizen of the world he has appeared as a guest on Oprah Winfrey
[01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:11.840]  show Glenn Beck you name it NBC nightly news friends research calm and again it
[01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:18.480]  was a dead cat bounce he said by the end of 2010 you're going to know we're in a
[01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:23.680]  depression and every real housing number jobless number social security cola
[01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:32.200]  number every inflation number every single number show that by every classical
[01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:37.120]  benchmark we were in a depression and when the government didn't announce a
[01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:40.040]  depression in December some people said oh look so let me say we'd be in a
[01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:45.040]  depression well now they're saying it's the greatest recession and the former
[01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:48.760]  head of the private fellow reserve told me the press don't worry we won't
[01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:54.560]  default we'll just print more money that is a default just unbelievable things
[01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:59.280]  are now being admitted I wish that I was wrong I wish Gerald was wrong but he's
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:09.920]  been absolutely right and he had the the guts the Cajones the wavos to actually
[01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:14.960]  put a date on it and so what happened is we were in the big depression by the
[01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:19.920]  time he said we would be but they said that no no no no no everything's fine
[01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:24.360]  and and still they're saying well we're in the greatest recession but but don't
[01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:28.680]  worry everything's going to be okay as they simply stall all they put their
[01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:33.800]  police state in Gerald Salente break it down for us please sir well you hit on
[01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:39.480]  it Alex they're covering it up this came out of Bloomberg yesterday it's not in
[01:41:39.480 --> 01:41:44.400]  today's Wall Street Journal it's not in that Turlett paper record the New York
[01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:53.000]  Times and it's not even in the Financial Times Wall Street aristocracy got 1.2
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:42:03.440]  trillion in fed secret loans that's what they did as all these banks like JP
[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:13.000]  Morgan Chase like the Goldman Sachs gang like the city group criminals like the
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:20.840]  Barclay bandits who all said hey our balance sheets are okay things are
[01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:28.800]  really fine they were getting tens of billions of dollars worth of loans Alex
[01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:34.720]  loans like you would get and maybe I'll charge you one percent because you're
[01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:40.880]  one of the white shoe boys they keep propping up this Ponzi scheme and they
[01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:47.720]  keep lying to us and the only reason these numbers just came out is because
[01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:53.920]  of the Dodd-Frank bill but there's that clause in there you know the insanity
[01:42:53.920 --> 01:43:01.400]  clause we got to wait two years before we release these numbers because you know
[01:43:01.400 --> 01:43:07.040]  we don't want people to see the real truth and they may pull their money out
[01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:12.440]  of these criminal organizations so they give us this baloney that that's why
[01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:17.200]  they can't put out these numbers and this is only what we're seeing look what
[01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:21.920]  Obama look where he's on that vacation again you know where did he spend last
[01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:28.480]  night oh at the prostitutes house that's right the guy that owns NBC
[01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:36.120]  Comcast it's all one club and we're not in it and you know you were talking
[01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:42.480]  about you know Venezuela North Korea none out this is fascism USA I said it
[01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:47.640]  when Obama got elected I said it when you did the Obama deception and that's
[01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:55.000]  what it is it's the merger of state and corporate powers you pointed out all
[01:43:55.000 --> 01:44:00.480]  the breaks that the big guys get like general electric you know like all of
[01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:06.000]  them they get the allowances while they are screwing the little people you
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:12.640]  mentioned at the lemonade stands the cheese how about that was some foods incident
[01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:18.120]  that you reported on a couple of weeks ago in Los Angeles where the food
[01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:23.440]  Gestapo came in and busted them and they were only supposed to take
[01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:28.320]  representative samples of what they was what they were it's a club they weren't
[01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:32.640]  even selling this stuff you belong to a club and what do they do a
[01:44:32.640 --> 01:44:38.080]  representative sample happened to be every piece of article in the joint so
[01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:45.360]  now as I'm speaking look at the price of gold one thousand eight hundred and
[01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:51.400]  eighty nine dollars an ounce and we had forecast at the beginning of this year
[01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:58.120]  I'm on all the major media two thousand dollars an ounce why is it going up one
[01:44:58.120 --> 01:45:04.520]  simple reason the entire global financial system is collapsing and all
[01:45:04.520 --> 01:45:09.040]  you the little children believe that it's going to be saved and let me throw
[01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:14.920]  this at you let me throw this at you because you did predict two thousand by
[01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:19.000]  the end of the year a bold prediction that was a long time ago you made that
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:22.680]  prediction and it's because you've been proven right that they're not going to
[01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:26.120]  be inviting you on all these shows and all these newspapers are going to
[01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:31.840]  interview you they called you a pessimist porno dealer just like the
[01:45:31.840 --> 01:45:36.080]  Pew research showed Ron Paul is getting less coverage than any other candidate
[01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:39.760]  including candidates that have dropped out because in reality he's in the top
[01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:44.520]  three candidates he's a major front-runner and he's been right so
[01:45:44.520 --> 01:45:48.880]  they're going to ignore him but when you're a liar well then they'll put you
[01:45:48.880 --> 01:45:55.440]  on national television it's because it's the houses of prostitution they just
[01:45:55.440 --> 01:46:01.080]  dare to serve their masters you just saw Obama make a trip to the master's
[01:46:01.080 --> 01:46:06.840]  house at Comcast this year he does yesterday up at Martha's Vineyard and
[01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:10.920]  that's all it is and I'm not a member I told you I think you know there also
[01:46:10.920 --> 01:46:14.840]  might be I think maybe they don't like the way I dress and I don't wear those
[01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:19.960]  Brooks Brothers suits you know and maybe the salenti does a ring right with them
[01:46:19.960 --> 01:46:25.800]  or that Bronx accent so I'm going to become maybe a Jay Endicott Chris Scott
[01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:33.160]  the third and if that doesn't work maybe Josh O'Shaughnessy Greenberg then I
[01:46:33.160 --> 01:46:36.280]  really be brilliant you know
[01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:59.200]  yeah they got these guys on CNBC every day you know it's like it's a comic so
[01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:04.400]  going back to what's going on let's see what's going on over in Europe the game
[01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:09.960]  is over they're talking about Euro bonds Merkel doesn't want to do it nobody
[01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:15.080]  really does so that's collapsing where they're going to get the money they're
[01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:20.240]  in zero interest rates so as we're talking the stock market took a little
[01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:28.280]  pop-up today why this is what they have the goal to say on the good news that
[01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:37.160]  Ben Bernanke may announce QE three by the end of the week the good news great
[01:47:37.160 --> 01:47:42.560]  more digital money not worth the paper it's not printed on will keep those
[01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:47.880]  interest rates near zero so all you people out there that used to put money
[01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:52.200]  in the bank and think you were going to get a return on it you're not gonna get
[01:47:52.200 --> 01:47:57.720]  anything unless you invest in the Ponzi scheme called Wall Street the whole
[01:47:57.720 --> 01:48:03.440]  system is collapsing and you mentioned about Biden being over in China sucking
[01:48:03.440 --> 01:48:08.280]  up and bowing down there's a photo of them last week he's walking down the
[01:48:08.280 --> 01:48:13.040]  gangplank you know this what Air Force to you know this this plane is big
[01:48:13.040 --> 01:48:17.440]  enough to move half a city you know and he's holding a hand of this young
[01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:23.200]  attractive woman I say well who's that and at the end it's his granddaughter
[01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:29.040]  Naomi and here you know they got all these guys saluting the red carpet what
[01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:33.800]  kind of baloney is this I thought he's going over there to do business he takes
[01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:38.080]  his granddaughter with him you know and who's paying for this stuff it's the
[01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:43.160]  same like Hillary Clinton she said Chelsea to the to the soccer game you
[01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:50.040]  know the cheer on the team everybody get this straight you have a royalty in
[01:48:50.040 --> 01:48:56.400]  this country Harvard Princeton Yale the bullets banks and bombs club and they
[01:48:56.400 --> 01:49:02.400]  only time when they want you is for cannon fodder and to pick your pocket
[01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:08.520]  so people that believe that you're going to have change you could believe in
[01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:14.200]  whether a voting for the Republicans and the Democrats you better grow up if
[01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:18.880]  you haven't grown up by now absolutely I want to play a clip for you and get your
[01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:23.600]  take on it to have Greenspan on meet the
[01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:28.840]  prostitutes to adopt your term that's I'm noticing is now becoming popularized
[01:49:28.840 --> 01:49:32.080]  so you've you've actually coined a phrase that's now going to be in popular
[01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:37.280]  use they say that's a real sign of true influence so congratulations
[01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:41.160]  prostitutes and I hope our listeners will start using it he was on meet the
[01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:45.720]  prostitutes and he said hey don't worry we're not going to default we'll just
[01:49:45.720 --> 01:49:50.000]  print money and they had the former White House financial advisor on there
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:55.920]  at Ghoulsby and he literally got shaken up and couldn't believe that Greenspan
[01:49:55.920 --> 01:50:00.760]  just said that so they've got the hutzpah the arrogance to come right out in
[01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:06.200]  the open and say we're going to devalue the dollar down to nothing let's play
[01:50:06.200 --> 01:50:12.720]  that clip here it is our US Treasury bonds still safe to invest in very much
[01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:19.800]  so I think there's a this is not an issue of credit rating the United States
[01:50:19.800 --> 01:50:26.400]  can pay any debt it has because we can always print money to do that so there
[01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:32.800]  was zero probability of the fall what and he's up there with a skull and bones
[01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:37.600]  or when we come back we'll get Gerald Salente's take on that and the skull and
[01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:41.520]  bones guy who's the other guest with him literally starts smiling you could tell
[01:50:41.520 --> 01:50:45.960]  as an adrenaline rush and you see a little bit of flush come to his face he
[01:50:45.960 --> 01:50:50.840]  actually he actually blushes like he goes my gosh that was just said and
[01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:55.680]  that's what Gerald was just getting into QE3 is like another bullet in the head
[01:50:55.680 --> 01:50:59.560]  well explain what this means on the other side the destruction of your
[01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:15.480]  intentions from the shattered Rust Belt come the Lost Vegas

[01:53:55.160 --> 01:54:02.000]  optics planet product specialist 800-332-6784
[01:54:08.160 --> 01:54:13.480]  okay our lines are loaded but when you hear a call or hang up to start taking
[01:54:13.480 --> 01:54:17.040]  your calls in the next hour for Gerald Salente that's your chance to get on
[01:54:17.040 --> 01:54:23.800]  board we'd love to hear from you 800-259-9231 I've got a host of other
[01:54:23.800 --> 01:54:29.720]  issues I want to pick Gerald Salente's brain on but Gerald finishing up with
[01:54:29.720 --> 01:54:34.480]  that clip we just played before the break of Greenspan with a very arrogant
[01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:38.320]  look on his face this is the guy that told Lair News Hour that the Federal
[01:54:38.320 --> 01:54:42.960]  Reserve is above the law and its own branch of government gee I didn't read
[01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:47.960]  that in the Constitution plus it's private I mean when does it end because
[01:54:47.960 --> 01:54:52.120]  they're old men and look like they've been put in a microwave and are wearing
[01:54:52.120 --> 01:54:56.640]  suits we've got to just let them gut and destroy everything what does it
[01:54:56.640 --> 01:55:01.400]  signify that they're talking about just printing money to a Weimar Republic
[01:55:01.400 --> 01:55:09.840]  level and that they're openly talking about QE3 Gerald. Well again now what
[01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:14.960]  is gold at now it's eight thousand one thousand eight hundred and ninety one
[01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:20.240]  dollars an ounce so that's what they're doing maybe you remember the old Weimar
[01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:25.920]  Republic they had the wheel barrows maybe we could have Bernanke barrows now so
[01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:30.520]  you could load them up we'll put bungee cords on them to hold the money in so you
[01:55:30.520 --> 01:55:35.800]  could buy a loaf of bread there's not one thing I agree with with that guy Rick
[01:55:35.800 --> 01:55:40.480]  Perry over there that's running for president except this one thing about
[01:55:40.480 --> 01:55:46.000]  him saying that Bernanke should be brought up for treason and so should
[01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:52.840]  this other guy Greenspan and by the way everything that these guys predicted has
[01:55:52.840 --> 01:55:57.120]  been wrong just just for the record but they keep bringing them back for their
[01:55:57.120 --> 01:56:04.040]  expertise they are robbing the people in front of our eyes I read to you that
[01:56:04.040 --> 01:56:11.400]  piece of Bloomberg that was reported yesterday one point two trillion dollars
[01:56:11.400 --> 01:56:21.040]  going to JPMorgan Chase going to Credit Suisse Society General Barclays and not
[01:56:21.040 --> 01:56:26.440]  a nickel for you or a nickel for me no no our tax money had to pay for this by
[01:56:26.440 --> 01:56:31.960]  the way MSNBC got hundreds of millions of dollars and as you said earlier and I
[01:56:31.960 --> 01:56:36.360]  have the article here who does he go visit but the head of Comcast that owns
[01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:41.200]  MSNBC and literally the subsidiaries they took control of are getting
[01:56:41.200 --> 01:56:46.840]  government money and so they talk about other people having state-run media we
[01:56:46.840 --> 01:56:52.480]  have state-run media it's just foreign banker run through the state I mean it's
[01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:58.800]  ridiculous it's state-run media you have it by the way if anybody wants to get a
[01:56:58.800 --> 01:57:05.200]  glimpse of what's going on over in Libya I suggest you tune in to RT you know
[01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:09.520]  Russian to Russia today because they're the only ones that are giving another
[01:57:09.520 --> 01:57:15.880]  side of the story and just like the prostitutes goddess into that Iraq war
[01:57:15.880 --> 01:57:20.720]  remember that one remember Saddam Hussein's weapons the man's destruction
[01:57:20.720 --> 01:57:25.840]  remember Katie Couric on the today's show walking across that map on the floor
[01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:30.680]  with that other prostitute what's that guy that former general they always
[01:57:30.680 --> 01:57:36.520]  dredge up all the time to send the people to war and they do it all remember
[01:57:36.520 --> 01:57:42.480]  the New York Times to print the paper the toilet paper a record about Saddam
[01:57:42.480 --> 01:57:49.440]  Hussein's yellow cake and the aluminum tubes their liars the all they're doing
[01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:56.120]  is what every prostitute does they serve their masters and if you were to put
[01:57:56.120 --> 01:58:02.000]  them all together you wouldn't come up with one pair of cojones among them
[01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:08.520]  all they're all suck ups and sellouts and they're selling out this country and

[02:01:39.960 --> 02:01:46.360]  way you slice it these are the facts the World Trade Centers came down the
[02:01:46.360 --> 02:01:53.520]  symbol of America's financial might hey Alex take a look at the Dow as we

[02:02:08.440 --> 02:02:14.200]  really shows your progress doesn't it more than impressive progress that
[02:02:14.200 --> 02:02:20.480]  portrays you know that general that now they've merged the CIA and the Defense
[02:02:20.480 --> 02:02:25.680]  Department now he's he's the head of the CIA but when he was running the war in
[02:02:25.680 --> 02:02:31.480]  Afghanistan impressive progress the war remember they whacked general headquarters

[02:02:36.720 --> 02:02:42.760]  damn thing the terrorists are winning they won look what happens to us when we
[02:02:42.760 --> 02:02:51.240]  go to the airports they x-ray us they feel us up they pat us down look at the
[02:02:51.240 --> 02:02:57.800]  Patriot Act we have no more constitutional rights the terrorists won
[02:02:57.800 --> 02:03:04.920]  you won't hear any of this when they have the celebrations we've lost how much
[02:03:04.920 --> 02:03:15.040]  since that time on the wonderful war on terror now we have home and security the
[02:03:15.040 --> 02:03:19.640]  terrorists one well that's it they're gonna be celebrating how they use the

[02:03:39.520 --> 02:03:42.320]  lungs are full of asbestos you name it but they have to go through a terror

[02:08:58.320 --> 02:09:02.880]  believe the government guys and that it's seen that they're hostile to the
[02:09:02.880 --> 02:09:07.280]  government now now when I've been down at ground zero a couple years after it
[02:09:07.280 --> 02:09:12.040]  happened and saying 9-11 was an inside job about half the folks were getting
[02:09:12.040 --> 02:09:18.280]  mad at me fireman police folks like that the last time I was there two three
[02:09:18.280 --> 02:09:23.640]  years ago they were all patting me on the back shaking my hand captains and
[02:09:23.640 --> 02:09:28.320]  fire department commanders and police commanders were nodding and smiling and
[02:09:28.320 --> 02:09:33.000]  saying we appreciate you Alex we know we know and I was like say that on tape
[02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:39.200]  was like no just know we know it was incredible and I'm not getting Gerald
[02:09:39.200 --> 02:09:45.480]  off into that the point is is that that's why they're excluded Fox News AP
[02:09:45.480 --> 02:09:51.520]  Reuters again the first responder heroes ten years later are excluded why
[02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:56.040]  because the vast majority of them know that those buildings were all blown sky
[02:09:56.040 --> 02:10:00.520]  high and they know they're angry they got their phones tapped you name it
[02:10:00.520 --> 02:10:10.120]  okay now Gerald digressing into another area it just came out in the nation
[02:10:10.120 --> 02:10:17.080]  magazine that strat for a large and establishment global intelligence
[02:10:17.080 --> 02:10:21.120]  private intelligence group it's been around for a very long time based in
[02:10:21.120 --> 02:10:25.960]  Austin Texas has come out and the nation magazines reporting strat for
[02:10:25.960 --> 02:10:31.000]  disputes OBL killing an obama bod and it goes on to say globally recognized
[02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:35.240]  intelligence and forecast strat for has rejected the US central intelligence
[02:10:35.240 --> 02:10:40.560]  claim that the man killed an obama bod compound by US Navy SEALs was Al Qaeda
[02:10:40.560 --> 02:10:44.440]  chief of summa bin Laden this was one of the reasons the CIA kept Pakistan's
[02:10:44.440 --> 02:10:49.560]  premier intelligence agency interservice intelligence in the dark and it goes on
[02:10:49.560 --> 02:10:55.800]  to say it's not true wow my my intel is it's totally fake I know you've laughed
[02:10:55.800 --> 02:10:59.400]  at the cement shoe thing but that's a big deal with somebody like strat for
[02:10:59.400 --> 02:11:03.240]  because they're highly respected comes out could we be coming to the end of the
[02:11:03.240 --> 02:11:07.640]  lies could people go ahead and realize there's no future if we don't stop going
[02:11:07.640 --> 02:11:12.840]  along with it no now I don't see that happening not the way it is now the whole
[02:11:12.840 --> 02:11:17.720]  game is so rigged we have such little freedom where do we where do we voice
[02:11:17.720 --> 02:11:21.760]  how it discontent you had the Republicans and the Democrats you know how I
[02:11:21.760 --> 02:11:26.720]  feel about it the Bananos of the Gambino is that your choice no it's not going to
[02:11:26.720 --> 02:11:31.840]  change until the individual changes Alex it's a much deeper issue than that as I
[02:11:31.840 --> 02:11:36.280]  see it I mean that's my belief I believe it's you know it's emotional it's like
[02:11:36.280 --> 02:11:43.960]  it's spiritual it's physical and it's emotional and until those levels change
[02:11:43.960 --> 02:11:48.160]  morality has to come back but people have to live that near individual lives
[02:11:48.160 --> 02:11:52.840]  and I'm not talking about this phony you know religious stuff we know where
[02:11:52.840 --> 02:11:57.040]  people tell you they are I know the real God and this is what it says I'm gonna
[02:11:57.040 --> 02:12:01.560]  talk about that one I'm talking about the inner truth and and most people
[02:12:01.560 --> 02:12:05.960]  haven't reached that yet you look at the you look at the state of the nation you
[02:12:05.960 --> 02:12:11.360]  look at this presidential reality show going on I mean it's bad theater I mean
[02:12:11.360 --> 02:12:15.520]  every time you see one of these candidates that show up in a farm state
[02:12:15.520 --> 02:12:20.480]  you think they could ever sit anywhere other than on a balay and the people
[02:12:20.480 --> 02:12:24.960]  keep buying this baloney so it's until the individual changes is that
[02:12:24.960 --> 02:12:31.160]  wonderful Hindus saying when the students ready the teacher appears and
[02:12:31.160 --> 02:12:35.440]  right now I don't believe the people are ready spiritually emotionally or
[02:12:35.440 --> 02:12:41.560]  physically well I agree the average man thinks that watching football is what it
[02:12:41.560 --> 02:12:45.880]  is to be a male not to be informed involved in their community and you know
[02:12:45.880 --> 02:12:51.960]  I mean real men the old-fashioned icon of it was not wanting to be a chump not
[02:12:51.960 --> 02:12:56.680]  being conned being independent and and and not trusting the government and
[02:12:56.680 --> 02:13:01.920]  being involved in your community now men just basically just run around acting
[02:13:01.920 --> 02:13:07.360]  like adolescents women act like tarts and is there any wonder that we've been
[02:13:07.360 --> 02:13:13.720]  totally taken over by criminal interest and it's more than that it's it's the
[02:13:13.720 --> 02:13:18.280]  drugs to and I'm not talking about and let's stop this baloney this war on
[02:13:18.280 --> 02:13:23.720]  drugs and busting people for pot what a lot of crap that is how about busting
[02:13:23.720 --> 02:13:28.640]  people for Xanax and all these wonderful drugs they put out there like you
[02:13:28.640 --> 02:13:35.120]  know oxy cotton there's a good winner for you so all these drugs these riddlings
[02:13:35.120 --> 02:13:40.280]  and the tons of drugs that people are taking the anti-depressants that's
[02:13:40.280 --> 02:13:45.840]  added into it as well and and as you mentioned about men and this is as I
[02:13:45.840 --> 02:13:50.360]  said you know when people upright have an uprising in this country these aren't
[02:13:50.360 --> 02:13:55.640]  just mommy's boys they're soccer mommy's boys look at these guys these
[02:13:55.640 --> 02:14:01.480]  prostitute reporters out there I mean again you know they're the goody two
[02:14:01.480 --> 02:14:06.720]  shoes I got an email from someone today that said they weren't renewing their
[02:14:06.720 --> 02:14:11.800]  subscription I'm not making this one up they said that although they bought gold
[02:14:11.800 --> 02:14:18.760]  in 2008 I think gold was trading for what about that six seven hundred dollars
[02:14:18.760 --> 02:14:24.720]  back then and and although they were a little more 800 I think such double more
[02:14:24.720 --> 02:14:29.800]  than double now and they did very well on our forecast by believing the
[02:14:29.800 --> 02:14:38.080]  forecast we haven't given enough information on how moms could do more to
[02:14:38.080 --> 02:14:46.800]  help their kids how moms could do more this is a soccer mommy society look at
[02:14:46.800 --> 02:14:53.560]  the TV shows look at the commercials have you ever seen a guy that could put
[02:14:53.560 --> 02:14:59.400]  one foot in front of his other without tripping over or being helped by some
[02:14:59.400 --> 02:15:05.640]  smart woman that's what I wanted to say women watch TV and men have bought into
[02:15:05.640 --> 02:15:10.200]  the role to act like goofballs but women so much the time really want to boss
[02:15:10.200 --> 02:15:14.000]  everybody around on average and they buy into this idea that they're the
[02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:18.320]  government enforcer and the government's their friend and it was Hitler that
[02:15:18.320 --> 02:15:22.360]  said first you get the women then you've you know got the children so follow the
[02:15:22.360 --> 02:15:28.120]  man and it's really true but hey don't worry I mean look Madison Avenue knows
[02:15:28.120 --> 02:15:31.560]  that women make about 80% of the purchases it's not that women are
[02:15:31.560 --> 02:15:35.080]  dumb or bad they've been targeted and they've bought in the little narrative
[02:15:35.080 --> 02:15:39.400]  that that Obama's gonna help them and stuff and they're gonna enjoy the
[02:15:39.400 --> 02:15:43.120]  Road Warrior Society that they've helped conjure and again if the whole
[02:15:43.120 --> 02:15:47.840]  country's been feminized and if it's not that if it's not the the women and it's
[02:15:47.840 --> 02:15:54.360]  the little kids I haven't met a little kid yet that isn't either amazing
[02:15:54.360 --> 02:16:01.280]  brilliant or special so it's either the little kids that are smarter than the
[02:16:01.280 --> 02:16:08.440]  guys or the women so the whole country's become feminized look at Congress
[02:16:08.440 --> 02:16:15.960]  look at these guys every one of them the only one again I have any respect for
[02:16:15.960 --> 02:16:20.760]  is Ron Paul I've said this I don't agree with him on some of his libertarian
[02:16:20.760 --> 02:16:25.960]  issues particularly on the environment and other but overall that's who I would
[02:16:25.960 --> 02:16:32.560]  cast my vote for at least he speaks his mind and has a spine the other ones go
[02:16:32.560 --> 02:16:37.560]  with the wind or else they help the special interests that give them the
[02:16:37.560 --> 02:16:44.240]  most so the nation is in this state so when you ask me will people wake up no
[02:16:44.240 --> 02:16:50.440]  not until they grow up absolutely let's take a few calls here let's talk to
[02:16:50.440 --> 02:16:57.880]  Ari in California you're on the air Ari thanks for holding hey hi Alex thanks
[02:16:57.880 --> 02:17:03.040]  for taking my call welcome what's on your mind I am gonna go off topic here a
[02:17:03.040 --> 02:17:07.840]  little bit but you mentioned something that at the beginning of your show today
[02:17:07.840 --> 02:17:14.120]  and I've heard you say that few times before and it was about Serbia and NATO
[02:17:14.120 --> 02:17:21.040]  yes now as somebody who lived through cost of a war I have no doubt they'll
[02:17:21.040 --> 02:17:26.000]  probably had their own interest to go there but to portray Serbia as some
[02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:31.400]  victim like you often do I just don't understand from somebody who is as
[02:17:31.400 --> 02:17:36.800]  informed as you are no no I'm not saying that Tito before was some great guy and
[02:17:36.800 --> 02:17:41.480]  I understand that both sides everybody was killing each other I'm not I mean I
[02:17:41.480 --> 02:17:46.920]  don't have any Serbian background so I don't have a dog in the hunt here what
[02:17:46.920 --> 02:17:51.880]  I was saying was is just like Libya they're going in creating a civil war
[02:17:51.880 --> 02:17:56.800]  they did fund Muslim groups out of Albania to attack the Serbs I'm talking
[02:17:56.800 --> 02:18:02.680]  about that into the war when NATO then came in and used to put uranium and what
[02:18:02.680 --> 02:18:07.440]  came out of that do you have any comments on this Gerald yes I do in one of my
[02:18:07.440 --> 02:18:13.320]  books when Zizi gave Honey Boy I wrote about how USA today came out in an
[02:18:13.320 --> 02:18:19.040]  article years later saying how the United States and they did it on July 4th
[02:18:19.040 --> 02:18:24.480]  weekend when nobody was reading the newspapers about how they trumped up the
[02:18:24.480 --> 02:18:29.160]  atrocities and it wasn't as bad as the United States said and the bottom line
[02:18:29.160 --> 02:18:34.520]  of course to all of this is it's none of our business how about straightening out
[02:18:34.520 --> 02:18:41.320]  Detroit cleaning up East St. Louis or St. Louis so it's this whole idea of the
[02:18:41.320 --> 02:18:47.320]  United States spreading democracy when we're taking it away from us over in
[02:18:47.320 --> 02:18:51.600]  our country over here that's my point is that they were knocking out the strongest
[02:18:51.600 --> 02:18:55.800]  country in the middle of all that and they were using al-Qaeda just as they're
[02:18:55.800 --> 02:19:00.200]  using al-Qaeda in Libya and ma'am I appreciate your call in fact maybe you
[02:19:00.200 --> 02:19:02.960]  should send me an email with your perspective perhaps I read it on air
[02:19:02.960 --> 02:19:08.280]  but I want to pick up on that as well because Serbia that you because the
[02:19:08.280 --> 02:19:13.360]  former Yugoslavia was the only country that was not buying in to that whole
[02:19:13.360 --> 02:19:18.760]  capitalist wave that was another issue because if you remember during the
[02:19:18.760 --> 02:19:24.560]  communist days Yugoslavia was doing better than just about anybody they
[02:19:24.560 --> 02:19:29.040]  were trying to export that you go wasn't much of an automobile but they were way
[02:19:29.040 --> 02:19:34.240]  ahead they were making some of the premier locomotives of the day it's the
[02:19:34.240 --> 02:19:38.520]  same thing in Libya same reason they've taken over Libya Gerald we are out of

[02:24:14.120 --> 02:24:19.360]  to join us via video skype just briefly to give us a breakdown of an article I
[02:24:19.360 --> 02:24:25.120]  worked on with him this morning Obama hit struggling Americans with energy
[02:24:25.120 --> 02:24:31.600]  rate hikes this is a big deal dealing with agenda 21 and then segway into
[02:24:31.600 --> 02:24:38.080]  Libya another article he did NATO hands terrorist who killed US troops control
[02:24:38.080 --> 02:24:44.960]  of Libya al Qaeda gets a new home as rebels sees Tripoli I mean now that
[02:24:44.960 --> 02:24:50.680]  they've pretty much taken over and Gaddafi scurrying around somewhere now
[02:24:50.680 --> 02:24:53.480]  it's just going to be an endless civil war which is exactly what they want
[02:24:53.480 --> 02:25:00.520]  Paul Watson well that's right Alex and I mean back in on July 8th I wrote an
[02:25:00.520 --> 02:25:06.240]  article and also I was on your show where my cadams was hosting it and the
[02:25:06.240 --> 02:25:11.360]  headline of the article was US wants Gaddafi toppled by September the United
[02:25:11.360 --> 02:25:15.560]  States and France set a deadline September 2nd to topple Libyan leader
[02:25:15.560 --> 02:25:20.000]  Colonel Gaddafi and basically there at that time they were saying to him look
[02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:24.240]  if you don't step down now we're going to launch a massive bombardment of NATO
[02:25:24.240 --> 02:25:28.640]  and we're going to basically bomb you out of there and that's exactly what
[02:25:28.640 --> 02:25:36.360]  happened on Saturday and Sunday had NATO jets RAF fighters bombarded Tripoli and
[02:25:36.360 --> 02:25:42.720]  then al Qaeda rebels can now storm in and steal the 144 tons of gold and take
[02:25:42.720 --> 02:25:48.120]  over the country and basically turn it into an extremist backwater Libya of
[02:25:48.120 --> 02:25:53.440]  course because Gaddafi had spent most of the oil money on he'd reinvested it in
[02:25:53.440 --> 02:25:57.480]  the country was they had one of the highest living standards in the region
[02:25:57.480 --> 02:26:01.800]  now that's all going to be eviscerated and I mean that's what that's why in the
[02:26:01.800 --> 02:26:06.440]  middle-class support Gaddafi in the first place because relatively in
[02:26:06.440 --> 02:26:10.160]  comparison to other countries in North Africa and the Middle East it's a good
[02:26:10.160 --> 02:26:15.280]  standard of living for those people in Libya in Tripoli in the major cities so
[02:26:15.280 --> 02:26:21.640]  now that's all eviscerated you've got a bomber and Cameron you know grandstanding
[02:26:21.640 --> 02:26:27.240]  at the glorious victory as if they commanded the army themselves and
[02:26:27.240 --> 02:26:32.040]  basically it's going to turn into another quagmire once those extremist get
[02:26:32.040 --> 02:26:36.560]  control it's going to turn into another Iraq and of course the irony irony is
[02:26:36.560 --> 02:26:41.920]  that the very terrorists who killed US troops in Iraq and Afghanistan the same
[02:26:41.920 --> 02:26:49.200]  al Qaeda that was funded by MI5 in 1996 to assassinate Gaddafi is now going to
[02:26:49.200 --> 02:26:54.360]  be firmly in control with globalist blessings in Libya well again your
[02:26:54.360 --> 02:26:58.880]  anti-america anti-anglin that you don't support al Qaeda would you like to
[02:26:58.880 --> 02:27:04.120]  apologize for not supporting the glorious al Qaeda well I'm just still
[02:27:04.120 --> 02:27:09.000]  surprised that those people that rioted and looted in the UK a couple of weeks
[02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:13.440]  ago aren't the legitimate government because I thought that's how we do
[02:27:13.440 --> 02:27:18.800]  business now I mean they were called protesters remember back in March even
[02:27:18.800 --> 02:27:22.600]  as they seized military tanks and fighter jets the media called them
[02:27:22.600 --> 02:27:27.520]  protesters for three weeks just to give the UN time enough to craft this
[02:27:27.520 --> 02:27:32.080]  resolution which they instantly violated the no-fly zone turned into a
[02:27:32.080 --> 02:27:36.160]  bombardment overnight and then arming training funding the rebels again
[02:27:36.160 --> 02:27:41.280]  violating their own resolution and now we come to this operation mermaid dawn
[02:27:41.280 --> 02:27:45.880]  endgame and of course the establishment media is all joyous at these
[02:27:45.880 --> 02:27:50.840]  celebrations as if it's some organic uprising there was a massive sustained
[02:27:50.840 --> 02:27:55.760]  bombardment on saturday and sunday night some you know 1300 people dead
[02:27:55.760 --> 02:27:59.640]  5000 injured and that the media is treating it as if it's just some
[02:27:59.640 --> 02:28:03.880]  organic uprising no way now those planes bombs they were dropping killing people
[02:28:03.880 --> 02:28:08.720]  that was peace peace bombs from the peace laureate Barack Obama who has more
[02:28:08.720 --> 02:28:12.680]  troops deployed than George W. Bush did at any time in his presence what's wrong
[02:28:12.680 --> 02:28:16.400]  with you Paul I mean working with al Qaeda and bombing and killing
[02:28:16.400 --> 02:28:22.680]  civilians is peace it's it's kinetic action exactly well you're very you're
[02:28:22.680 --> 02:28:26.800]  very evil I mean look it's totally going to disintegrate into badlam which is
[02:28:26.800 --> 02:28:30.640]  order out of chaos that's what they want so now the rest of Africa will sink
[02:28:30.640 --> 02:28:34.520]  deeper into the mark what about the fact the White House responded us in
[02:28:34.520 --> 02:28:38.560]  february and now it's totally confirmed they're saying they're gonna shut down
[02:28:38.560 --> 02:28:42.080]  most the power plants not owned by general electric who's been given the
[02:28:42.080 --> 02:28:47.800]  waivers this article we've got out today is so important Paul it's important
[02:28:47.800 --> 02:28:52.880]  because it's not just the fact that it's in americans with massive power bill
[02:28:52.880 --> 02:28:57.000]  rises you know right on the edge of a double dick recession which is exactly
[02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:01.440]  what's happening in the UK double percentage point increases on your gas
[02:29:01.440 --> 02:29:04.920]  and electricity they made the same announcements your carbon taxes are set
[02:29:04.920 --> 02:29:10.160]  to double your prices yeah and it's it's not just hollowing out the american
[02:29:10.160 --> 02:29:15.600]  industry it's cap and trade via the back door because remember Obama tried to
[02:29:15.600 --> 02:29:20.520]  get it passed in Congress he failed and now he's going to these power companies
[02:29:20.520 --> 02:29:24.640]  through the APPA and say you have to get these controls in place they can't do
[02:29:24.640 --> 02:29:29.120]  it so they're just having to purchase credit carbon credits from the other
[02:29:29.120 --> 02:29:32.800]  power companies that the pollution is still going out there but Al Gore
[02:29:32.800 --> 02:29:37.040]  Obama and the Rothschilds are still getting their carbon payments so
[02:29:37.040 --> 02:29:43.600]  it's okay well that's good al-Qaeda's and victorious that that's pro-america only
[02:29:43.600 --> 02:29:48.480]  the insiders get to have power plants prices are going up that's good and so
[02:29:48.480 --> 02:29:55.680]  it's wonderful we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[02:29:55.680 --> 02:30:03.600]  GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[02:30:03.600 --> 02:30:07.920]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation
[02:30:07.920 --> 02:30:11.280]  could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new
[02:30:11.280 --> 02:30:15.200]  energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[02:30:15.200 --> 02:30:19.400]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[02:30:19.400 --> 02:30:23.840]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[02:30:23.840 --> 02:30:28.600]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:30:28.600 --> 02:30:32.400]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:30:32.400 --> 02:30:36.040]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[02:30:36.040 --> 02:30:40.360]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[02:30:40.360 --> 02:30:43.520]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[02:30:43.520 --> 02:30:47.200]  generators offered by solution from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[02:33:14.040 --> 02:33:17.840]  we're gonna be talking with Webster Griffin Tarpoli who was recently in
[02:33:17.840 --> 02:33:23.320]  Tripoli under the bombardment reporting for info wars.com in a moment some of his
[02:33:23.320 --> 02:33:28.640]  colleagues that he knows have been wounded in the humanitarian bloodbath
[02:33:28.640 --> 02:33:34.920]  that is known as Nobel Peace we're gonna be looking at that and reports of a
[02:33:34.920 --> 02:33:40.880]  Gaddafi counterattack of fake dead Gaddafi photos drifting around this is
[02:33:40.880 --> 02:33:45.880]  quite the spectacle and the new model of how the UN will invade you they will
[02:33:45.880 --> 02:33:50.560]  fund terrorists to attack they will uprise if you fight back in any way
[02:33:50.560 --> 02:33:57.520]  you will be bombarded with kinetic love bombs and if you're not for Al Qaeda
[02:33:57.520 --> 02:34:03.400]  you're an American now I guess I'm an American then because it's admitted and
[02:34:03.400 --> 02:34:07.400]  we have the quotes here of the rebel leaders that they've killed Americans in
[02:34:07.400 --> 02:34:12.040]  Iraq and that they still hate America well then why would our government be
[02:34:12.040 --> 02:34:18.080]  doing this because they don't like stable countries they want to destabilize all
[02:34:18.080 --> 02:34:23.000]  of Africa even further so that's coming up with Webster Tarpoli Watson finishing
[02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:27.400]  up with your central article I've seen the articles in England and the London
[02:34:27.400 --> 02:34:32.000]  Telegraph just a few weeks ago power price is set to double in the next three
[02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:38.000]  years and so they can't get the carbon tax that's paid to the Rothschild slash
[02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:43.080]  Rockefeller Al Gore I mean they openly own it carbon exchanges you go to them
[02:34:43.080 --> 02:34:47.720]  and pay them money I'm I'm burning coal I'll pay you money Al Gore and he goes
[02:34:47.720 --> 02:34:54.800]  good my son your family is taken out of purgatory I absolve you pay more money
[02:34:54.800 --> 02:34:59.920]  and we will get you the rest of your family out of hell itself oh thank you
[02:34:59.920 --> 02:35:05.280]  Al Gore oh great man bear pig but now they've already had rolling blackouts
[02:35:05.280 --> 02:35:12.280]  massive power increased cost and now in your article you've got all these major
[02:35:12.280 --> 02:35:15.440]  power companies that aren't part of the insider group you've got the Texas Power
[02:35:15.440 --> 02:35:19.680]  Commission the Texas Public Utility Commission saying get ready for huge
[02:35:19.680 --> 02:35:24.400]  blackouts and double the power prices the Fort Worth star telegrams reporting
[02:35:24.400 --> 02:35:29.600]  that and this will be more of a blessing with General Electric who's had a
[02:35:29.600 --> 02:35:33.800]  waiver since February running around giggling and laughing in front of
[02:35:33.800 --> 02:35:41.040]  everyone obviously increasing power output at their factories at their
[02:35:41.040 --> 02:35:45.920]  generating systems I mean this is totally mafia this is like saying you
[02:35:45.920 --> 02:35:51.120]  can only buy groceries from you know Obama's maybe they'll start a string of
[02:35:51.120 --> 02:35:54.600]  grocery stores I guess they kind of have done that with nafta and Gatt with
[02:35:54.600 --> 02:36:01.400]  Walmart so finishing up Paul Watson from England well precisely I mean G gives
[02:36:01.400 --> 02:36:05.040]  Obama half a million dollars they get the waiver that's how it works that's
[02:36:05.040 --> 02:36:09.240]  how that's Chicago land for you but this this is tens of billions of profit
[02:36:09.240 --> 02:36:15.240]  conservatively over the next few years for a half mill well precisely I mean it
[02:36:15.240 --> 02:36:20.000]  it's it's over a hundred billion dollars just in the immediate cost that these
[02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:24.360]  power companies will have to pay and as I said before even if you believe that
[02:36:24.360 --> 02:36:27.640]  carbon dioxide and these other greenhouse gases that they're talking
[02:36:27.640 --> 02:36:31.960]  about you know deadly killers they're gonna be emitted anyway it's just the
[02:36:31.960 --> 02:36:35.760]  power companies are gonna buy the carbon credits from Al Gore the Ross
[02:36:35.760 --> 02:36:41.120]  Childs and Obama who is also invested in it and they're gonna pass the cost on
[02:36:41.120 --> 02:36:45.600]  to the consumers that's why our bills are going up 20% but the Ross childs
[02:36:45.600 --> 02:36:50.000]  have yachts and private jets that put out a special gas that counteracts the
[02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:54.000]  devil carbon dioxide so you want to pray to them did you know that the Ross
[02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:59.560]  child flatulence is actually the only gas humans live off of well precisely and
[02:36:59.560 --> 02:37:04.000]  you know Ted Turner can have five kids Rockefeller can have six kids but over
[02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:08.280]  populations the problem we can't have any the thing is though I mean look at
[02:37:08.280 --> 02:37:13.480]  this UK faces green agenda backlash as energy prices rise for the for the
[02:37:13.480 --> 02:37:17.600]  moment they're going up 20% they'll go up more next year but that's also the
[02:37:17.600 --> 02:37:21.360]  amount that they spend on so-called green energy and this is the same in both
[02:37:21.360 --> 02:37:26.840]  countries and it mainly goes on wind turbines which are notoriously inefficient
[02:37:26.840 --> 02:37:30.760]  in northern Europe when we get cold weather like we did last winter you know
[02:37:30.760 --> 02:37:35.640]  coldest winter in a hundred years they don't work do you have to get really
[02:37:35.640 --> 02:37:39.680]  powerful winds for them to work and even then they're so much more expensive to
[02:37:39.680 --> 02:37:44.000]  run they always break you know birds are flying into them you can't maintain
[02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:47.480]  them because they're out in these isolated locations and all our money is
[02:37:47.480 --> 02:37:52.400]  being spent on this because they've got this commitment to generate 20% green
[02:37:52.400 --> 02:37:56.600]  energy I think it's wonderful the next 10 years I think it's totally reasonable
[02:37:56.600 --> 02:38:01.840]  that insiders get waivers from not having to buy health care on Obamacare and
[02:38:01.840 --> 02:38:07.080]  that General Electric gets a waiver that they wrote I mean they wrote it to shut
[02:38:07.080 --> 02:38:10.760]  down their competition I think that's fine and I think Al Qaeda taking over
[02:38:10.760 --> 02:38:14.240]  Libby is a wonderful thing and I just again I'm really ashamed that you're
[02:38:14.240 --> 02:38:19.880]  not for for Al Qaeda Paul well I guess that you know as long as we as long as
[02:38:19.880 --> 02:38:23.680]  we do pay our carbon credits at least the space aliens won't attack because
[02:38:23.680 --> 02:38:28.640]  that's what the NASA scientists told us last week space aliens are concerned
[02:38:28.640 --> 02:38:32.560]  about global warming if we don't line the pockets of Al Gore the first carbon
[02:38:32.560 --> 02:38:37.640]  billionaire you know ET might come and get us so by the way Jaren actually when
[02:38:37.640 --> 02:38:41.240]  I talked about this yesterday did post the Guardian article a NASA funded
[02:38:41.240 --> 02:38:46.320]  scientist and this is the one and Guardian headline came out and said pay
[02:38:46.320 --> 02:38:50.680]  Al Gore the money or the aliens are gonna kill us I mean Paul next they're
[02:38:50.680 --> 02:38:54.800]  gonna say Freddie Kruger is coming if you don't pay man bear pig and of course
[02:38:54.800 --> 02:38:58.720]  I joked about the flatulence of the Rothschilds they are now in Europe and
[02:38:58.720 --> 02:39:04.160]  it's starting in the US Canada already passed it the Cal flatulence tax and so
[02:39:04.160 --> 02:39:08.040]  they're saying that Cal's flatulence is gonna kill the earth even though the
[02:39:08.040 --> 02:39:14.880]  earth's always been covered with with herbivores bovine creatures I mean they
[02:39:14.880 --> 02:39:19.920]  wiped out the tens of millions of buffalo and replaced it with a animal
[02:39:19.920 --> 02:39:25.040]  that can breed with it another type of domesticated cow that's I mean it's
[02:39:25.040 --> 02:39:30.520]  insane they say aliens are gonna get us Cal flatulence is evil pay Rothschild
[02:39:30.520 --> 02:39:34.200]  more money I mean you could not make up a joke this disgusting and this sick
[02:39:34.200 --> 02:39:40.800]  they're paying a sheep flatulence tax in Australia now and they're openly the
[02:39:40.800 --> 02:39:44.080]  New York Times of the headline three years ago attacks on breathing they're
[02:39:44.080 --> 02:39:48.600]  not playing games and there's all these weird goody two shoes running around who
[02:39:48.600 --> 02:39:53.040]  like get off on hating themselves and they want to pay a tax for breathing
[02:39:53.040 --> 02:39:58.960]  these are mentally ill people Paul oh yes just save the planet kill yourself but
[02:39:58.960 --> 02:40:03.080]  these people are in power John Holdren's in control of the geoengineering and
[02:40:03.080 --> 02:40:07.560]  then you've got this planned opolis agenda which is what the big oil companies
[02:40:07.560 --> 02:40:11.360]  and the British government put out a couple years ago where they say if you
[02:40:11.360 --> 02:40:14.480]  want to drive a car you're gonna have to apply for permission from the government
[02:40:14.480 --> 02:40:18.560]  we're gonna have a global food council you're gonna get meat as a rare delicacy
[02:40:18.560 --> 02:40:22.720]  maybe one of them wants to deadly they've got trendies posing as patriots
[02:40:22.720 --> 02:40:27.000]  liberal filmmakers making movies about the same plastic cities we're all gonna
[02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:32.520]  have to go live in yeah and it's it's a it's a throwback to Maoist China even as
[02:40:32.520 --> 02:40:37.800]  recently as the 80s people who lived in China poor people they'd meet was a rare
[02:40:37.800 --> 02:40:43.080]  delicacy once a month treat and in this planned opolis slave opolis the people
[02:40:43.080 --> 02:40:47.240]  who resist are gonna be thrown in these cry freedom ghettos where they're
[02:40:47.240 --> 02:40:52.120]  segregated off from the rest of society that's not my terminology that's what
[02:40:52.120 --> 02:40:56.200]  they call them in their own video promoting this agenda so people need to
[02:40:56.200 --> 02:41:02.120]  realize that these people are in control they're insane and that you know
[02:41:02.120 --> 02:41:05.360]  they're holding the reins of power they're insane like a fox their low-level
[02:41:05.360 --> 02:41:10.000]  minions are mentally ill and just like a moth to flame enjoy the control freak
[02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:13.280]  authoritarianism and believe that they're gonna be part of it because they've
[02:41:13.280 --> 02:41:17.840]  given themselves to it you know that's your average general loser but on top
[02:41:17.840 --> 02:41:21.920]  they're cold-blooded they say how do we sell slavery and make folks love it we
[02:41:21.920 --> 02:41:26.600]  teach people how to help themselves and then have a new green Nazism sold while
[02:41:26.600 --> 02:41:29.840]  they fly around in their private jets Paul Watson will continue to track these
[02:41:29.840 --> 02:41:34.520]  articles as they unfold the White House responded to us in February everybody
[02:41:34.520 --> 02:41:38.880]  needs to get this article out Obama hit struggling Americans with energy rate
[02:41:38.880 --> 02:41:43.800]  hikes thank you so much Paul Watson thanks Alex all right Webster Griffin
[02:41:43.800 --> 02:41:47.520]  Tarbley who bravely spent several weeks in Libya a little over a month ago and
[02:41:47.520 --> 02:41:53.520]  reported to us live under the peaceful kinetic military bombardment that's
[02:41:53.520 --> 02:41:56.840]  killed thousands and thousands of people but I'm politically correct it is
[02:41:56.840 --> 02:42:01.920]  peaceful and non-military because they said so now it's confirmed Al Qaeda are
[02:42:01.920 --> 02:42:06.160]  the leaders headline NATO hands terrorists who killed US troops control
[02:42:06.160 --> 02:42:11.440]  over Libya Al Qaeda gets new home as rebels sees Tripoli what is the
[02:42:11.440 --> 02:42:15.520]  strategy I'm here what's the latest that Webster Griffin Tarbley has he also
[02:42:15.520 --> 02:42:19.240]  reported to me that one of his colleagues Dr. Franklin Lam shot in
[02:42:19.240 --> 02:42:28.240]  Tripoli by NATO Al Qaeda peace activist Webster Tarbley tell us more about the
[02:42:28.240 --> 02:42:32.440]  peace that's reportedly killed thousands in the last 24 hours well what
[02:42:32.440 --> 02:42:36.520]  we're dealing with here is a carefully cynically planned military operation by
[02:42:36.520 --> 02:42:41.200]  the NATO high command with the US playing a very very important role in it
[02:42:41.200 --> 02:42:46.200]  don't listen to anything to the contrary it is called Operation Mermaid Dawn and
[02:42:46.200 --> 02:42:50.200]  in the middle of that you've also got something called Operation Mermaid or
[02:42:50.200 --> 02:42:57.120]  Operation siren similar terms coming maybe from the French but this is a
[02:42:57.120 --> 02:43:01.520]  military operation and it's basically this they're facing the mid-september
[02:43:01.520 --> 02:43:06.880]  deadline when the United Nations Security Council resolution runs out and
[02:43:06.880 --> 02:43:11.960]  without that resolution it's very hard for Italy and Canada and a bunch of
[02:43:11.960 --> 02:43:17.240]  smaller NATO countries to play a role and since the main bases have to be in
[02:43:17.240 --> 02:43:23.880]  Italy because of the geography there's a hysterical attempt in NATO to put an end
[02:43:23.880 --> 02:43:31.400]  to this now what they've done is first of all carpet bombing instead of fought
[02:43:31.400 --> 02:43:36.680]  crime love bombing yeah right carpet bombing carpet bombing of civilians no
[02:43:36.680 --> 02:43:41.840]  concern for civilian casualties just a mad dash to get it all over with so very
[02:43:41.840 --> 02:43:47.960]  very heavy bombing of Tripoli and of the approaches to Tripoli in the past week
[02:43:47.960 --> 02:43:52.960]  or so and in addition a very aggressive use of these Apache helicopters with a
[02:43:52.960 --> 02:43:58.920]  lot of strafing of civilians with machine guns especially in some rockets
[02:43:58.920 --> 02:44:05.200]  and this this is accounted for something upwards of 1,300 dead civilians in the
[02:44:05.200 --> 02:44:12.040]  past 48 hours let's say 1,300 dead as of yesterday and then many more overnight
[02:44:12.040 --> 02:44:16.200]  so this is this is the protection of civilians under the UN Security
[02:44:16.200 --> 02:44:20.800]  Council resolution so carpet bombing Apache helicopters that accounts for the
[02:44:20.800 --> 02:44:24.760]  rapid progress of the rebels now the other thing that accounts for it is
[02:44:24.760 --> 02:44:31.800]  amphibious landings all reports now agree that smaller landing craft as well
[02:44:31.800 --> 02:44:37.280]  as larger NATO warships cruised up very close to the coast there to the port of
[02:44:37.280 --> 02:44:43.240]  Tripoli on the Mediterranean and landed these death squads these terror teams of
[02:44:43.240 --> 02:44:49.080]  al-Qaeda killers who had been shipped in from Benghazi and Tobruk and and
[02:44:49.080 --> 02:44:54.440]  Turner and places like this so this webster's only look we're pro-america
[02:44:54.440 --> 02:44:58.160]  here on this show so don't don't criticize the valley and al-Qaeda forces
[02:44:58.160 --> 02:45:02.720]  right now by the way they're banning first responders from the 9-11
[02:45:02.720 --> 02:45:06.840]  remembrance events so the nylon responders are bad al-Qaeda's good I'm
[02:45:06.840 --> 02:45:10.520]  gonna have to have you apologize for talking about al-Qaeda we're gonna have
[02:45:10.520 --> 02:45:16.320]  to let you go okay so the this I think it counts for this it's it's like it's
[02:45:16.320 --> 02:45:20.160]  what you call a war for a coup de man in other words they've they've taken some
[02:45:20.160 --> 02:45:24.560]  key parts of the of the city however the reports I'm getting and these come from
[02:45:24.560 --> 02:45:28.080]  Franklin lamb that you mentioned wounded though he is he continues to report
[02:45:28.080 --> 02:45:32.960]  Lizzie Phelan who has been in the rickshaw's hotel and Darius Makhty
[02:45:32.960 --> 02:45:39.240]  Nazem Roliah you can see a lot of this on Russia today they continued to report
[02:45:39.240 --> 02:45:44.600]  during the night and especially Franklin lamb is up in a high-rise hotel and he
[02:45:44.600 --> 02:45:50.560]  can see the approaches coming into Tripoli from the from the west so what
[02:45:50.560 --> 02:45:55.720]  we've got is reports of a counterattack being organized by the Gaddafi forces
[02:45:55.720 --> 02:46:00.840]  starting from the Gaddafi compound with heavy fighting going on their tanks
[02:46:00.840 --> 02:46:06.440]  under Gaddafi and his supporters moving towards green square we're even told
[02:46:06.440 --> 02:46:12.480]  that the rebels have lost control at least temporarily did lose control of
[02:46:12.480 --> 02:46:18.080]  green square when a column of Gaddafi forces went through there the counter
[02:46:18.080 --> 02:46:23.800]  attack seems to be under the command of Thomas Gaddafi K-H-A-M-I-S that's the
[02:46:23.800 --> 02:46:29.680]  one son who has not been captured three other sons captured one son killed
[02:46:29.680 --> 02:46:34.400]  months ago the other thing we have is from Franklin lamb in his vantage point
[02:46:34.400 --> 02:46:42.880]  in this high-rise hotel he says that he saw a convoy of 25 pro-gaddafi military
[02:46:42.880 --> 02:46:50.440]  trucks going towards the center of the city so this I don't think is over and
[02:46:50.440 --> 02:46:54.320]  there's some indications that there was actually a strategy I would say the
[02:46:54.320 --> 02:46:59.120]  Gaddafi forces were taken by surprise by the amphibious landings this may be
[02:46:59.120 --> 02:47:03.240]  accounts for why they didn't use their anti ship missiles which they are known
[02:47:03.240 --> 02:47:08.360]  to have by the way my sources say U.S. NATO and private contractors were
[02:47:08.360 --> 02:47:13.680]  inserted two days ago from the sea it's probably not just the valley and al-qaeda
[02:47:13.680 --> 02:47:18.280]  people yes well the report that I have if you if you look look at topsy.net
[02:47:18.280 --> 02:47:23.560]  I've got the the report is that from May saw that the al-qaeda fighters from
[02:47:23.560 --> 02:47:28.480]  Benghazi that were landed by NATO were under the control of NATO officers so
[02:47:28.480 --> 02:47:33.760]  European officers which reproduces the eternal pattern of the colonial army
[02:47:33.760 --> 02:47:38.560]  just what the Libyans have thought that they'd they'd gotten rid of so heavy
[02:47:38.560 --> 02:47:43.120]  fighting I think goes on there is a humanitarian emergency in particular I
[02:47:43.120 --> 02:47:48.200]  would mention that the people in this rixos hotel the international reporters
[02:47:48.200 --> 02:47:52.400]  these are international reporters who are basically anti-nato they don't agree
[02:47:52.400 --> 02:47:56.800]  with the CIA line and that would that would be Maxi Darius Nazem Rawiah that
[02:47:56.800 --> 02:48:01.160]  you can see on Russia today Franklin Lamb is in a different hotel and that
[02:48:01.160 --> 02:48:05.640]  Terry Mason is also still in the city I would also point out there seems to be
[02:48:05.640 --> 02:48:11.560]  danger to the life of Musa Ibrahim who is the spokesperson of the regime as well
[02:48:11.560 --> 02:48:15.920]  as his wife and his son the rebels are telling people on on YouTube that
[02:48:15.920 --> 02:48:20.280]  they're going to exact a terrible fate now you can well that's a piece to the
[02:48:20.280 --> 02:48:23.120]  killing women and children you know that's that's what the good guys do
[02:48:23.120 --> 02:48:27.240]  you're not going to criticize torture on this show are you we could we I think we
[02:48:27.240 --> 02:48:31.960]  can we can simply you know if you want to start taking case study of the human
[02:48:31.960 --> 02:48:35.920]  rights record of these Benghazi rebels see what happens to Musa Ibrahim and his
[02:48:35.920 --> 02:48:41.120]  family that will tell you everything now in terms of what's going to happen now
[02:48:41.120 --> 02:48:47.920]  Gaddafi if Gaddafi can can maintain some kind of a of a position in the
[02:48:47.920 --> 02:48:51.480]  capital or nearby that's that's a very different scenario from what the
[02:48:51.480 --> 02:48:57.000]  television was telling you if Gaddafi is decidedly defeated in the Tripoli area
[02:48:57.000 --> 02:49:02.920]  he would probably be well advised to take the example of Mubarak and go to
[02:49:02.920 --> 02:49:09.000]  some friendly place and perhaps lay low for a while and wait for the inevitable
[02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:12.480]  civil war among these thieves because these are thieves who are going to fall
[02:49:12.480 --> 02:49:15.800]  out you can already see they've been constantly killing each other and
[02:49:15.800 --> 02:49:19.680]  calling in airstrikes on each other that's admitted exactly so that would be
[02:49:19.680 --> 02:49:25.120]  this Khalifa hipster the top CIA guy is Khalifa hipster but of course he lived
[02:49:25.120 --> 02:49:29.680]  in Virginia he lived here by between the Pentagon and the CIA for 20 years and
[02:49:29.680 --> 02:49:33.800]  they're going to be factional differences between him and say a bunch of
[02:49:33.800 --> 02:49:40.120]  guys like the ones who who in Darna who had been fighting the US in Iraq and
[02:49:40.120 --> 02:49:43.800]  Afghanistan I don't see how they're gonna get along very well you've also got
[02:49:43.800 --> 02:49:50.520]  Chalil who is the the presentable face and Jabril these people have really no
[02:49:50.520 --> 02:49:55.040]  mass support they're there to have a presentable face that they can send to
[02:49:55.040 --> 02:50:00.080]  the United Nations and so forth so I would expect a bloody civil war to
[02:50:00.080 --> 02:50:05.160]  break out among the rebel factions quite soon and especially we've got this
[02:50:05.160 --> 02:50:10.280]  70-page report of what the occupation is going to look like the the occupation
[02:50:10.280 --> 02:50:16.600]  calls for tens of thousands of troops from the United Arab Emirates Emiratis
[02:50:16.600 --> 02:50:21.040]  now those guys are royalists their reactionaries in all of their social
[02:50:21.040 --> 02:50:26.000]  policies whereas Gaddafi is one of the most progressive socially oriented
[02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:31.120]  people right all the oil money was used or to a large extent for for healthcare
[02:50:31.120 --> 02:50:34.400]  for so they're gonna send in foreigners to help make sure all the money is
[02:50:34.400 --> 02:50:39.640]  stolen and to enforce a privatization deregulation the race to the bottom the
[02:50:39.640 --> 02:50:45.080]  usual IMF shock therapy agenda but if the foreign troops come in even if they're
[02:50:45.080 --> 02:50:50.120]  so-called Arabs from the United Arab Emirates or even worse Qatar the the
[02:50:50.120 --> 02:50:54.800]  people there in Doha that will lead to a civil war I think in short order so my
[02:50:54.800 --> 02:50:59.680]  my advice is stay there so basically absolute humanitarian disaster in the
[02:50:59.680 --> 02:51:04.200]  name of stopping one are you tired of spending money for metal canning lids

[02:54:03.960 --> 02:54:09.560]  Webster Griffin Tarbley is our guest I've seen three polls out this weekend
[02:54:09.560 --> 02:54:14.960]  where Ron Paul is number one the drudge report at drudgereport.com we're also
[02:54:14.960 --> 02:54:19.480]  posting this at infoworks.com I has the headline that Ron Paul is evenly
[02:54:19.480 --> 02:54:24.840]  matched against Obama he's neck and neck with Obama there it is Gallup
[02:54:24.840 --> 02:54:29.800]  Obama closely matched against Paul and Bachman so as I keep telling you because
[02:54:29.800 --> 02:54:34.840]  I'm not just cheerleading here and saying Ron Paul can win you know three and a
[02:54:34.840 --> 02:54:39.200]  half years ago I was just pointing out he's an underdog but he should win now
[02:54:39.200 --> 02:54:43.080]  if you look at all the hundreds of polls I've seen different straw polls he's
[02:54:43.080 --> 02:54:48.640]  number one number two or number three now that is a frontrunner that's with
[02:54:48.640 --> 02:54:54.480]  them ignoring him or demonizing him so they're definitely scared of Ron Paul
[02:54:54.480 --> 02:54:59.680]  now shifting years back to Webster Griffin Tarbley of Tarbley.net Webster
[02:54:59.680 --> 02:55:04.400]  any way you slice it I'm not a fan of Gaddafi but compared to Al Qaeda there
[02:55:04.400 --> 02:55:08.840]  is such a thing as lesser of two evils and he wasn't a total pig I mean he did
[02:55:08.840 --> 02:55:13.280]  build up the country and the rest of Africa and we know it means civil war
[02:55:13.280 --> 02:55:21.000]  death destruction of a comparative jewel in the region and this is the same
[02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:25.080]  reason they took down Serbia again not a fan of Milošević or any of those guys
[02:55:25.080 --> 02:55:31.600]  but at the end of the day why did NATO do this? Well on the one hand a Gaddafi
[02:55:31.600 --> 02:55:36.400]  represents an ideological threat because of this Arab socialism which he
[02:55:36.400 --> 02:55:42.640]  actually practiced. Libya probably has the best record of any oil producing
[02:55:42.640 --> 02:55:47.840]  country in terms of reinvesting that in social development. This was the top
[02:55:47.840 --> 02:55:52.600]  country on the United Nations Human Development Index for Africa and they
[02:55:52.600 --> 02:55:57.520]  were at 57 in the world which meant that they were beating Russia, beating
[02:55:57.520 --> 02:56:02.160]  Ukraine, beating Brazil and it's remarkable because they had started so
[02:56:02.160 --> 02:56:07.800]  near rock bottom they were absolute basically nomads until about when I'm
[02:56:07.800 --> 02:56:13.800]  1965-1970 when when Gaddafi came in. Remember you've got that great man-made
[02:56:13.800 --> 02:56:16.800]  river which means that they're gonna have water for the next couple of
[02:56:16.800 --> 02:56:22.200]  hundred years unless NATO has bombed it in the meantime and that you know
[02:56:22.200 --> 02:56:25.640]  healthcare was for free housing allowances were given these are the
[02:56:25.640 --> 02:56:30.360]  things that NATO hates so they want to go in there now and privatize all that
[02:56:30.360 --> 02:56:34.320]  then they had been the weakening of Gaddafi is due to the fact that there
[02:56:34.320 --> 02:56:39.600]  was a first privatization offensive in 2003 when they demanded the partial
[02:56:39.600 --> 02:56:43.760]  privatization is certain of the oil and because he was he was under the gun of
[02:56:43.760 --> 02:56:47.920]  what Bush had just done in Iraq he felt that he had to make concession then
[02:56:47.920 --> 02:56:51.840]  unfortunately that even reached up into his into his family. And now it's
[02:56:51.840 --> 02:56:55.840]  admitted that the 70 plus billion in banks is being stolen the tens of
[02:56:55.840 --> 02:57:00.680]  millions in gold is now going to disappear and stolen from the people of
[02:57:00.680 --> 02:57:06.480]  Libya. I mean this is just so outrageous. Right the frozen assets that the
[02:57:06.480 --> 02:57:10.680]  State Department has got custody of now the US part I don't know how many
[02:57:10.680 --> 02:57:14.000]  billion there are but there are there are quite a few billion that's going to
[02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:19.120]  go into the Swiss bank accounts of these face men like Jaleel Jabriel
[02:57:19.120 --> 02:57:23.680]  Hifter the people who are running that Benghazi rebel council and none of that
[02:57:23.680 --> 02:57:27.760]  will ever be seen as humanitarian aid. This is going to be a kleptocracy beyond
[02:57:27.760 --> 02:57:30.960]  your wild. Well that's my next issue. Are they going to use Libya as their new
[02:57:30.960 --> 02:57:36.760]  al-Qaeda base to then menace the West? Yeah you can imagine al-Qaeda piracy in
[02:57:36.760 --> 02:57:40.800]  the Mediterranean. Now it's funny and if you go back to American history in the
[02:57:40.800 --> 02:57:45.560]  early 1800s. Thomas Jefferson. The big concern was the the Barbary pirates right
[02:57:45.560 --> 02:57:49.280]  Stephen Decatur and all this that meant that these these these ports in North
[02:57:49.280 --> 02:57:54.400]  Africa were bases of pirates and the pirates of course worked with the
[02:57:54.400 --> 02:57:58.320]  British because the British brought protection others couldn't the US couldn't
[02:57:58.320 --> 02:58:02.160]  and didn't and therefore had to wage these wars. Today you've got the US
[02:58:02.160 --> 02:58:07.240]  intervening in a place like Libya to reestablish piracy but this time under
[02:58:07.240 --> 02:58:11.320]  al-Qaeda auspices so this is going to have a big effect on the entire
[02:58:11.320 --> 02:58:16.600]  Mediterranean literal from Spain to Italy to Greece all the way across. This is
[02:58:16.600 --> 02:58:21.960]  now going to fundamentally change what the Mediterranean looks like and again
[02:58:21.960 --> 02:58:25.720]  it's it's going to be an open sore. If you didn't want al-Qaeda to have a
[02:58:25.720 --> 02:58:29.680]  sanctuary if that was the point of Afghanistan they have just been given a
[02:58:29.680 --> 02:58:34.640]  sanctuary or at least it's still there. Let's do five let's do five more minutes
