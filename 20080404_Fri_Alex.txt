[01:39.260 --> 01:43.460]  of fortune and reach it into the grab bag and hearing what the callers have to
[01:43.460 --> 01:49.500]  say next takes us in so many unexpected directions that's the real wildcard 1
[01:49.500 --> 02:02.700]  800-259-9231 1 800-259-9231 I was on coast to coast AM last night I get so
[02:02.700 --> 02:08.740]  accustomed to knowing what a piece of filth Ted Turner is that when it came
[02:08.740 --> 02:13.820]  out in the news in the last two days that Ted Turner was talking about world
[02:13.820 --> 02:19.460]  population reductions and one child policies in the US that I didn't even
[02:19.460 --> 02:26.900]  talk about it and that's because you tend to be so close to a problem so close
[02:26.900 --> 02:32.780]  to an issue it's common knowledge to me and to you the listeners to I and
[02:32.780 --> 02:44.980]  everybody out there listening and so we become aware of this to a point to where
[02:44.980 --> 02:52.220]  as it becomes common knowledge it's old hat and we don't warn the people when
[02:52.220 --> 02:57.740]  they begin to find out about what's happening because it is old hat we need
[02:57.740 --> 03:03.860]  it to when this type of stuff is in the news pointed out to people when it's in
[03:03.860 --> 03:09.820]  the Associated Press and when it's in the Atlanta Journal Constitution and
[03:09.820 --> 03:14.100]  hundreds of other publications in the last two days you need to print that off
[03:14.100 --> 03:17.820]  and show it to your co-workers and then tell them hey find out the rest of the
[03:17.820 --> 03:25.060]  story watch in game blueprint for global enslavement that film needs to be seen
[03:25.060 --> 03:29.340]  it needs to be understood I believe it is the most important film ever made
[03:29.340 --> 03:33.780]  about the new world order and not because I made it but because in the two
[03:33.780 --> 03:38.100]  hours and 20 minutes in the film proper in the 40 plus minutes of extras we give
[03:38.100 --> 03:42.500]  you the history of the global elite how they operate the political system they're
[03:42.500 --> 03:46.180]  setting up how they've broken the world into unions how they're now merging those
[03:46.180 --> 03:50.780]  unions how they're setting up a control grid and then why they want to strap us
[03:50.780 --> 03:54.780]  down why they want the police state grid in place so they can have an orderly
[03:54.780 --> 04:00.420]  extermination of the population through bio weapons mainly they will release and
[04:00.420 --> 04:04.900]  then they will pose as the saviors during each cycle trying to keep us safe from
[04:04.900 --> 04:10.540]  the new bio attack administering vaccines and other drugs that are only the
[04:10.540 --> 04:17.860]  precursor to the next attack so it's free on Google video and I know you know

[07:44.620 --> 07:55.380]  on the web eFoodsDirect.com 800-409-5633 the Genesis communications radio
[07:55.380 --> 08:00.980]  network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your
[08:00.980 --> 08:18.700]  mind
[08:18.700 --> 08:24.820]  I was making a point that we have Ted Turner running around talking about how
[08:24.820 --> 08:32.700]  there's too many people and how we need to have a global one-child policy and I
[08:32.700 --> 08:37.500]  suggest that if people are so bad we all need to die that Mr. Ted Turner that he
[08:37.500 --> 08:42.020]  and his five children go out and find a large cliff at the Grand Canyon they can
[08:42.020 --> 08:46.500]  all hold hands and say one two three and jump off together and plunge of their
[08:46.500 --> 08:51.580]  deaths now I don't want that to happen and there's plenty of room for all of us
[08:51.580 --> 08:55.940]  to live in peace with the globalist Ted Turner but if he insists on pushing his
[08:55.940 --> 09:01.340]  eugenics policies and funding hardcore eugenics ops in Africa and other places
[09:01.340 --> 09:06.860]  I would like him and his disgusting family of degenerate scum to go ahead and
[09:06.860 --> 09:12.820]  jump off of the cliff it's real simple or he can go out on his yacht as I said on
[09:12.820 --> 09:17.820]  coast to coast AM last night he can tie some bowling balls to his legs and he
[09:17.820 --> 09:24.220]  can jump off the side of his yacht into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of
[09:24.220 --> 09:31.500]  Georgia there at his home and he can go to the bottom oh but no he needs to live
[09:31.500 --> 09:37.980]  he needs to oversee the eugenics oh no Ted Turner and is very important Ted
[09:37.980 --> 09:43.900]  Turner his life matters we're gonna let everybody know you're the enemy Turner
[09:43.900 --> 09:48.020]  and if you and your buddies are dumb enough to release a bio weapon everybody's
[09:48.020 --> 09:52.620]  gonna know who did it you understand doesn't matter how many microbiologists
[09:52.620 --> 09:57.020]  get double capped in the head or run over by trucks or drowned or tortured to
[09:57.020 --> 10:03.740]  death when that bio weapon gets released and weren't able to stop you
[10:03.740 --> 10:09.420]  everybody's gonna know who's behind it scumbag you can have some ADL grandson
[10:09.420 --> 10:14.100]  on television uploaded by the Intel Center saying he did it but it didn't
[10:14.100 --> 10:19.260]  go to fly you understand it didn't gonna fly
[10:20.220 --> 10:24.140]  yeah that's what I think about when I go to bed at night very serious issues
[10:24.140 --> 10:28.620]  we live in a very serious world this isn't a joke it isn't a game it isn't a
[10:28.620 --> 10:35.580]  drill this is for all the marbles and people in the FBI and in the CIA and
[10:35.580 --> 10:43.420]  others who don't want to die and who don't want to be cold you better get up
[10:43.420 --> 10:47.660]  off of your hind ends and stop living in denial or stop rationalizing what the
[10:47.660 --> 10:52.740]  elites are doing and saying it's good and realize it is a nightmare it stinks to
[10:52.740 --> 10:58.140]  high heaven you group of freaks a lot of your control freaks but you think you're
[10:58.140 --> 11:01.420]  gonna be on the top of the pyramid let me just give you a logic here look at
[11:01.420 --> 11:06.020]  history study the numbers you are not gonna be at the top of the pyramid you
[11:06.020 --> 11:09.340]  in fact of the first group they're gonna target because you know where the
[11:09.340 --> 11:16.020]  bodies are buried better extricate yourself from the situation there it's
[11:16.020 --> 11:20.740]  never too late to turn back if you've got any inkling of conscience right now
[11:20.740 --> 11:27.100]  any inkling of you know a tingling your spine no one I'm telling the truth that
[11:27.100 --> 11:31.500]  means you haven't lost your soul yet means you haven't burned off your psychic
[11:31.500 --> 11:35.820]  feelers yet yet and hardened your heart yet hadn't been totally turned over to
[11:35.820 --> 11:41.380]  wickedness yet if you have any feelings now of remorse or any feelings of
[11:41.380 --> 11:46.580]  wanting to join us and if you feel drawn towards the light then come towards it
[11:46.580 --> 11:52.540]  you can still come back no matter how far you've gone into darkness I've taken
[11:52.540 --> 11:58.260]  my own forays into darkness and I'm telling you you can come back from that
[11:58.260 --> 12:03.940]  some ways it makes you stronger a lot of people who have never seen the dark side
[12:03.940 --> 12:11.740]  are in some levels blind but those of us that have in our lives seen the dark
[12:11.740 --> 12:21.780]  side it's much easier to see it much easier to see it okay we're gonna get
[12:21.780 --> 12:24.900]  into Turner that's my point I meant to get to it yesterday I was on coast to
[12:24.900 --> 12:28.340]  coast and last night for 45 minutes but still didn't have time to get into all
[12:28.340 --> 12:31.700]  the points I wanted to make really appreciate George having me on to talk
[12:31.700 --> 12:36.380]  to 16 million people an hour in the first hour of his show that's the biggest
[12:36.380 --> 12:42.380]  hour because this is big medicine this is the big issue this is what it all
[12:42.380 --> 12:47.260]  hinges on this is the ideology that drives the mindset of the globalist
[12:47.260 --> 12:55.380]  their every waking moment is dedicated to this dark crucible let me just read you
[12:55.380 --> 13:02.740]  the headlines federal cops continue roundups in war as Mexico state fusion
[13:02.740 --> 13:06.940]  centers and Pentagon run FBI program spy on Americans how many years have I
[13:06.940 --> 13:11.220]  told you the FEMA emergency management centers the threat fusion centers that
[13:11.220 --> 13:16.540]  they built in the late 90s those are all federalization centers and I want to
[13:16.540 --> 13:22.420]  get into some today how they integrate the police into the martial law grid

[13:29.540 --> 13:34.100]  application after 9-11 inside the United States so we're now getting the memos

[14:03.020 --> 14:06.500]  do this because they like it they want the power so they can do it and get away
[14:06.500 --> 14:12.140]  with it you understand Stalin getting into power it was a means to an end

[25:04.300 --> 25:10.980]  it's so excited that I'm not very good at basic math everybody knows that one
[25:10.980 --> 25:16.060]  digit is one and two digits is ten and three is a hundred and four is a thousand
[25:16.060 --> 25:22.620]  so on up to a truck to Gillian's and to infinity but yesterday I was reading
[25:22.620 --> 25:27.820]  Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and the New York Department
[25:27.820 --> 25:34.540]  of Health and Environment school fluoride program and I was reading where
[25:34.540 --> 25:39.860]  different states have pills and drinks and mouth washes that they make the
[25:39.860 --> 25:46.220]  kids take that are point two point three point four point five they're all point
[25:46.220 --> 25:51.780]  two or above and I was on air I just said the quandary I said what is point
[25:51.780 --> 25:57.460]  two on and on air I said is that one one thousandth and then after out of air I
[25:57.460 --> 26:03.620]  thought about I went no that's that's two one hundredths and that's why I
[26:03.620 --> 26:10.220]  couldn't on air it didn't click it's so amazing one part per million in university
[26:10.220 --> 26:14.180]  studies government studies has been found especially in young people it's
[26:14.180 --> 26:21.340]  even greater effect a 20 percent excuse me 20 point IQ reduction some studies
[26:21.340 --> 26:25.460]  show 10 some show 15 but you can look that up but we've got newscast we can
[26:25.460 --> 26:29.580]  play right here that's a 20 point IQ reduction it really affects developing
[26:29.580 --> 26:36.500]  brains so when I saw the numbers of one one hundredth two one hundredths three
[26:36.500 --> 26:42.100]  one hundredths four one hundredths five one hundredths I mean ladies and
[26:42.100 --> 26:51.740]  gentlemen five one hundredths two one hundredths of sodium fluoride that is
[26:51.740 --> 26:58.500]  centers for disease control that is poison control center emergency but in
[26:58.500 --> 27:04.260]  plain view every week in public schools coast-to-coast generally in
[27:04.260 --> 27:09.980]  disadvantaged areas we want to meet your poor we don't think you're probably
[27:09.980 --> 27:15.780]  brushing your teeth wink wink black Hispanic we've got these pills we want
[27:15.780 --> 27:25.780]  you to chew these gums these fluoride treatments that are deadly poison one
[27:25.780 --> 27:37.740]  part per million is devastating we're talking on average two parts per hundred
[27:39.220 --> 27:49.020]  zombies now the government now the CDC the FDA and then private groups like the
[27:49.020 --> 27:54.140]  American Dental Association the Kidney Disease Association they've all had to
[27:54.140 --> 27:57.540]  come out in the last three years and said okay yeah children shouldn't even have
[27:57.540 --> 28:02.060]  one part per million it's very toxic gives them fluorosis it's causing kidney
[28:02.060 --> 28:08.580]  problems we need to take fluoride out but the public doesn't hear about that
[28:08.580 --> 28:13.420]  meanwhile the feds and see I went to Margaret Sanger elementary and it had
[28:13.420 --> 28:17.180]  kindergarten in Dallas I went one year right in the heart of Dallas then we
[28:17.180 --> 28:22.740]  moved to suburb it was about half black it was a lower middle class kind of blue
[28:22.740 --> 28:28.920]  college school and man they came in there all the time and they gave us these
[28:28.920 --> 28:32.460]  red pills it would make us sicker than dogs they made us wash our mouths out
[28:32.460 --> 28:36.580]  of course the teachers meant well we're helping these poor disadvantaged
[28:36.580 --> 28:52.740]  children with drinks two parts per hundred two parts per hundred I feel

[35:53.500 --> 35:58.020]  job buildings were blown up we talked about the evil government how they could
[35:58.020 --> 36:01.180]  do it how the public can't believe that they're getting in the car with a
[36:01.180 --> 36:06.820]  killer you know the same analogy a Ted Bundy I use he agreed with that we were
[36:06.820 --> 36:13.300]  just talking about and it is in hundreds of newspapers today all over
[36:13.300 --> 36:20.900]  television stations across the country it is in scores of newspapers separate
[36:20.900 --> 36:26.980]  articles not just the AP story and now more and more people are not afraid to
[36:26.980 --> 36:31.500]  speak up and stand up it's becoming more and more mainstream to look into it
[36:31.500 --> 36:35.300]  being an inside job and all the cent com bullies that want to gut this
[36:35.300 --> 36:38.500]  Constitution this bill of rights all the people that have infiltrated our
[36:38.500 --> 36:43.700]  government infiltrated our military want to bring us down all the people that
[36:43.700 --> 36:48.460]  are on the take they're defending from a cowardly position just because they get
[36:48.460 --> 36:52.580]  paychecks or they are they're weak-minded and they get paychecks so they
[36:52.580 --> 36:57.580]  rationalize we're defending because we have to save this country and this is
[36:57.580 --> 37:00.780]  where we live and they're built in FEMA camps and we don't have a choice we've
[37:00.780 --> 37:07.860]  got to fight back so you're failing miserably and I want you to know that
[37:07.860 --> 37:13.100]  and you're failing because people are committing they don't care if you kill
[37:13.100 --> 37:15.980]  us they don't care if you trump stuff up and imprison us and I'm speaking for
[37:15.980 --> 37:22.100]  myself right now we don't care what you do we're doing what we're gonna do you
[37:22.100 --> 37:26.580]  understand that you can do whatever you want we see your deck we're at ramming

[37:30.780 --> 37:34.340]  we're still gonna run right into you and it's gonna blow up your magazine in the
[37:34.340 --> 37:40.700]  info war you're going to the bottom and you know it there's hundreds of kamikazis

[37:45.020 --> 37:50.060]  not you cannot stop us there is nothing you can stop you can do nothing you set
[37:50.060 --> 37:53.900]  off terror attacks it'll give you limited power but it'll burn out even
[37:53.900 --> 37:58.140]  quicker because the concept of false flag is introduced and who has motive has
[37:58.140 --> 38:01.980]  now been introduced our numbers we've got people everywhere our numbers are
[38:01.980 --> 38:07.380]  exponentially growing we are defeating you the cancer you are the cancer and
[38:07.380 --> 38:14.060]  you will be cut out do you understand wrapping yourself in the flag that's
[38:14.060 --> 38:20.140]  camouflage that's just like an enemy aircraft painting itself up like
[38:20.140 --> 38:23.620]  friendly aircraft we have ripped aside the veil we've shown people you're the
[38:23.620 --> 38:34.460]  enemy people know you're the enemy and it's exponentially growing right now so
[38:34.460 --> 38:38.260]  we're gonna get into that let's go to the calls right now let's talk to Jarrett
[38:38.260 --> 38:42.180]  first-time caller from Oregon you're on the air Jarrett hi Alex I've been
[38:42.180 --> 38:45.380]  listening for a couple years and I just wanted to say something about chem
[38:45.380 --> 38:50.060]  trails people don't know what they are those are vitamin those are vitamin
[38:50.060 --> 38:54.260]  trails sir oh yeah you're right no the EPA the same guys that said the air was
[38:54.260 --> 38:57.620]  safe to breathe on 9-11 they sent me a fact sheet they said it was ice crystals
[38:57.620 --> 39:02.180]  it's such a relief anyway I looked I looked it up and there's like two pages
[39:02.180 --> 39:06.340]  of bacteria it's biological warfare that's what made me want to call you
[39:06.340 --> 39:11.540]  well well well the chem trail program the aerial spring the aerosol spring which
[39:11.540 --> 39:16.180]  a lot of its declassified is a cocktail it's weather modification and then at the
[39:16.180 --> 39:19.700]  lower levels I mean you'll it'll be the summer at 3,000 feet they're forming oh
[39:19.700 --> 39:25.340]  ice crystals at 3,000 feet and I mean I mean I'm an Easter Bunny and yeah
[39:25.340 --> 39:28.780]  these suddenly these ice crystals stay there for five hours and then now
[39:28.780 --> 39:34.580]  universities and others have done it it's barium salts it's aluminum oxide it's
[39:34.580 --> 39:38.420]  it's just nutritious sir let's paint the picture for people I mean look up in
[39:38.420 --> 39:42.660]  the sky there's a plane going overhead and the the contrail disappears that's
[39:42.660 --> 39:47.020]  the trail behind the jet but then some of them don't disappear okay well
[39:47.020 --> 39:50.420]  sometimes they're different well people will say it's atmospheric conditions
[39:50.420 --> 39:54.580]  you'll have a plane at the same level flying not leaving one and you'll have
[39:54.580 --> 39:58.780]  another one at the same level leaving one it's called biological warfare no
[39:58.780 --> 40:02.940]  it's your minerals they're giving you your minerals sir well they need
[40:02.940 --> 40:05.780]  everybody let's take some action on this let's call let's raise hell I've been
[40:05.780 --> 40:10.380]  calling 911 and then the operator says well I don't notice anything I said
[40:10.380 --> 40:12.980]  because you haven't been paying attention let's raise hell about it's
[40:12.980 --> 40:16.220]  biological warfare that's the air we breathe I hear you and I appreciate your
[40:16.220 --> 40:22.020]  call take my uncle helicopter pilot vietnam then he was a fixed-wing
[40:22.020 --> 40:27.940]  aircraft pilot all over the u.s. of Latin America he never saw them until
[40:27.940 --> 40:36.300]  96 and he said suddenly in 96 and he was in I guess Lano Texas at the time
[40:36.300 --> 40:43.140]  suddenly I think was in Fredericksburg suddenly it just changed suddenly it
[40:43.140 --> 40:48.940]  just they started hanging there and then NASA admitted five years ago the
[40:48.940 --> 40:55.780]  earth is 20% darker now something changed in the atmosphere and the
[40:55.780 --> 40:59.620]  evidence is they add stuff to the fuel it's compartmentalized where they only
[40:59.620 --> 41:04.620]  need to control a few of the jet fuel major companies and then whatever's
[41:04.620 --> 41:10.020]  being added is aerosolized through the engines once it's in the atmosphere and
[41:10.020 --> 41:14.540]  then now in government federal federally approved and written textbooks for
[41:14.540 --> 41:18.180]  8th graders we've covered this a couple years ago it said oh yes it's just it's
[41:18.180 --> 41:24.140]  a sunscreen because of global warming it's saving the earth and then the you
[41:24.140 --> 41:29.220]  can look up government programs about the aerosol program and then they admit
[41:29.220 --> 41:33.580]  they've done quote weather control we've got newscast in Oregon and Florida and
[41:33.580 --> 41:41.580]  Dakota where you'll have thousand mile 500 mile long sprays that are you know
[41:41.580 --> 41:45.540]  500 miles long and 300 miles wide and they'll see oh this is Air Force chaff
[41:45.540 --> 41:52.540]  I've never seen this much chaff they released the little aluminum and and
[41:52.540 --> 42:01.100]  10 pieces of metal chaff behind them just over you know maximum maybe a few
[42:01.100 --> 42:04.980]  hundred square miles not even that much not hundreds of thousands of square
[42:04.980 --> 42:09.140]  miles and that's so when they're flying over on bombing runs radar can't pick
[42:09.140 --> 42:13.700]  them up that's just to confuse right where the planes are for missiles for
[42:13.700 --> 42:19.540]  Sam surface-to-air missiles it isn't 500 miles long I mean I remember watching
[42:19.540 --> 42:26.620]  this newscast out of Florida a few weeks ago and it's at least 200 miles wide
[42:26.620 --> 42:32.620]  and 400 miles long I mean it goes a hundred miles out in the ocean across
[42:32.620 --> 42:35.740]  Florida right through the middle of it and then a hundred miles on the other
[42:35.740 --> 42:44.180]  side perfect square and the guy says oh it's Air Force chaff no it's not I mean
[42:44.180 --> 42:49.580]  now the weathermen are seeing giant patterns that cover more than half the
[42:49.580 --> 42:56.260]  state and they're saying chaff it's not chaff ladies and gentlemen it must have
[42:56.260 --> 43:00.180]  taken two hundred airplanes to do that
[43:03.780 --> 43:08.940]  I mean they're just they're just running wild everywhere they are it's a
[43:08.940 --> 43:13.100]  scientific dictatorship they've been developing secret technologies for 50
[43:13.100 --> 43:17.860]  plus years underground Lord knows what they really got publicly they've been
[43:17.860 --> 43:23.780]  for more than a decade cross-human animal species it's finally hitting the
[43:23.780 --> 43:29.700]  news they have just it's it's genetic engineering it's all just completely out
[43:29.700 --> 43:37.020]  of control fish infusion heavy reactors giant cyclotron smashing heavy
[43:37.020 --> 43:42.460]  elements together understand that's how they make a bombs and hydrogen bombs
[43:42.460 --> 43:49.220]  they're just doing it the globalist are suicidal nihilist that's by the way in
[43:49.220 --> 43:54.860]  the endgame they say that about themselves Nero finally committed
[43:54.860 --> 44:01.460]  suicide I mean they get so hateful this is what they do that they are a guild of
[44:01.460 --> 44:06.140]  psychopaths runs the planet okay I said I take calls I'm already digressing I
[44:06.140 --> 44:14.780]  just can't believe that that's what runs this planet I just why skip in
[44:14.780 --> 44:21.500]  California you're on the air hey I have a couple of observations I want to run by
[44:21.500 --> 44:30.100]  you one is last year when the movie borak came out then making him was the
[44:30.100 --> 44:36.580]  kind of the popular cool thing to do yes after people I work with did it we did
[44:36.580 --> 44:40.580]  it too around here it's pretty funny well you've got another character named
[44:40.580 --> 44:47.420]  Bruno that's a gay fashion journalist and I my I imagine that when he comes out
[44:47.420 --> 44:51.980]  again mimicking him will acting effeminate will be the cool thing to do
[44:51.980 --> 44:58.220]  well I disagree with you it's fun to make fun of some central Asian and
[44:58.220 --> 45:02.140]  that's kosher to do but most people aren't gonna want to imitate an effeminate
[45:02.140 --> 45:07.660]  person but but who knows we'll see is you think it's a mass programming I don't
[45:07.660 --> 45:12.780]  know what it is I just but I do realize that when it comes out see what happens
[45:12.780 --> 45:17.020]  um but the other observation I want to touch on was I really thought a lot
[45:17.020 --> 45:22.380]  about these black holes that they're possibly creating and I kind of came up
[45:22.380 --> 45:27.220]  with two reasons why they would want to do it one is I think that it kind of
[45:27.220 --> 45:32.380]  works as a safety net like if you have these set up all over the United States
[45:32.380 --> 45:38.420]  or wherever you want to be protected no one's gonna drop a bomb there because
[45:38.420 --> 45:43.660]  it'll get rid of the entire world but keeps that area safe from being attacked
[45:43.660 --> 45:47.020]  by another I understand what you're saying and I appreciate your call you're
[45:47.020 --> 45:52.220]  saying that they use these big field generators to contain the black the
[45:52.220 --> 45:57.060]  tiny black holes that they admittedly have created they're not the same type
[45:57.060 --> 46:00.580]  as you would see in deep space but they're similar similar phenomenon and
[46:00.580 --> 46:06.300]  so then the Russians wouldn't attack it because if they blow up the facility then
[46:06.300 --> 46:09.580]  the black hole will get loose I don't really think that's kind of far-fetched
[46:09.580 --> 46:14.380]  but who knows with these people the point is they want to play God and so they
[46:14.380 --> 46:17.500]  don't even know according to what they're saying what they're doing it's
[46:17.500 --> 46:23.140]  pure research and they admit oh yeah this could cause a chain reaction and
[46:23.140 --> 46:28.940]  could then implode the earth or could you know shift you know create a particle
[46:28.940 --> 46:32.540]  that bonds everything else and basically turns us all to rock instantly
[46:32.540 --> 46:36.540]  there's a lot of different things it could do as to put it in layman's terms
[46:36.540 --> 46:43.780]  but they got us all worried about carbon dioxide that plants breathe that's the
[46:43.780 --> 46:49.380]  new global tax a new threat they've listed as a toxic waste it's not it's a
[46:49.380 --> 46:53.100]  life gas just like oxygen it's it's it's it's it's 50% of the life equation on
[46:53.100 --> 46:59.740]  this planet well you could argue you need oxygen you need carbon dioxide and you
[46:59.740 --> 47:05.660]  need water but the two gases that are used in respiration by humans by all
[47:05.660 --> 47:09.340]  animals and then by plants it's it's 50% of the equation you could say it's
[47:09.340 --> 47:17.460]  33.3% of the equation if you added water into that but but meanwhile they're
[47:17.460 --> 47:21.060]  just just running around wildly doing whatever they want dumping toxic waste
[47:21.060 --> 47:26.540]  chopping down forest cross species open air everywhere spreading you know huge
[47:26.540 --> 47:32.420]  cyclotron smashing heavy particles into each other just hybrids human animal
[47:32.420 --> 47:38.500]  hybrids just frothing insanity understand when they're firing these DNA guns
[47:38.500 --> 47:43.900]  into the cells it creates super viruses it activates ancient viruses and bacteria
[47:43.900 --> 47:47.660]  that are built into our DNA they thought 96% of it was junk it wasn't it's an
[47:47.660 --> 47:51.820]  entire code of not just our species but other species that aren't even related
[47:51.820 --> 47:55.900]  in our evolution evolutionary development and I'm not debating evolution
[47:55.900 --> 48:00.540]  with people I believe in God I believe it's a false debate they've created to
[48:00.540 --> 48:05.060]  make people go argue how the earth was created or what was done and I'm not
[48:05.060 --> 48:08.340]  seeing the evolutionists are all right about how old the earth is I'm saying
[48:08.340 --> 48:17.300]  that the DNA it's a fact it is a fact that there are all these other viruses
[48:17.300 --> 48:22.700]  and bacteria and everything we've defeated as a species I mean they have
[48:22.700 --> 48:26.380]  found basically the entire DNA of a prehistoric crocodile in our genetics
[48:26.380 --> 48:35.460]  and the and the the genetic engineers and the Darwinists don't even know why
[48:35.460 --> 48:38.900]  that's there because they don't believe we're even descended from that in their
[48:38.900 --> 48:45.140]  false equation the answer is we don't know folks I mean we were designed in fact
[48:45.140 --> 48:48.820]  that's now happening all these top geneticists who were atheists I can list
[48:48.820 --> 48:52.660]  them there's you just type in top geneticist you know says there's design
[48:52.660 --> 48:57.660]  here says we were to you look at it folks it basically got serial numbers on
[48:57.660 --> 49:06.180]  it okay and they're in there with DNA guns just firing into all of it 96% of
[49:06.180 --> 49:12.180]  it they thought was junk it was not junk there is all sorts of incredible code
[49:12.180 --> 49:18.460]  in there and they blast genes into it and suddenly thousands of random things
[49:18.460 --> 49:24.820]  happen because either they got to play God they got to find out what it's gonna
[49:24.820 --> 49:29.020]  do and I'm not against research but you better be careful about it well they're
[49:29.020 --> 49:40.020]  not careful all right Peggy Mike Jimmy we'll get to you when we let's just go
[49:40.020 --> 49:46.740]  to one right now let's talk to Mike in Connecticut you're on the air hey Alex
[49:46.740 --> 49:51.780]  how you doing good I just wanted to bring up the fact that you know we're
[49:51.780 --> 49:58.140]  now in the second quarter of 2008 and listening to all the news reports out
[49:58.140 --> 50:04.620]  there you hear about the negative growth of the economy and everything's
[50:04.620 --> 50:10.860]  pointing towards the recession and I'm not an economics guy but I did take a
[50:10.860 --> 50:16.900]  few courses in college I do remember that a recession is pretty much two
[50:16.900 --> 50:23.420]  consecutive quarters of what they call negative real economic growth now my
[50:23.420 --> 50:30.260]  question is why can't any politician or any you know media news outlet just
[50:30.260 --> 50:34.500]  admit that we're in a recession stay there let's talk about only on the
[50:34.500 --> 50:39.700]  side I'll give you my take on this important question then we'll talk to
[50:39.700 --> 50:46.660]  Peggy and Jimmy and many others 1-800-259-1931 get in game blueprint for

[55:30.940 --> 55:37.740]  Jimmy Ian many others here in a moment go back to Mike in Connecticut Mike to
[55:37.740 --> 55:42.100]  answer your question in the past they would admit a recession because they
[55:42.100 --> 55:47.740]  were still trying to have some truth in the media now they are just practicing
[55:47.740 --> 55:53.340]  deception in reality for the last what six plus years we have at the average
[55:53.340 --> 55:57.540]  Americans lost about a thousand dollars pay a year those are federal numbers but
[55:57.540 --> 56:00.900]  they don't really publicize them so we've really been in a recession for a
[56:00.900 --> 56:04.220]  long time most of comments we have on say standard of living's been going down
[56:04.220 --> 56:08.020]  since the late 70s so that it really is a recession to we're just in a now a new
[56:08.020 --> 56:12.780]  debt economy but there's no doubt that for the last two quarters the last six
[56:12.780 --> 56:17.740]  months we which really been contracting but they're still having debates about
[56:17.740 --> 56:23.780]  that and lying about that and it's because things are so grave that they're
[56:23.780 --> 56:27.140]  busy positioning their money getting themselves ready for a larger implosion
[56:27.140 --> 56:30.620]  they don't want to scare all the cattle so they keep telling the cattle
[56:30.620 --> 56:34.620]  everything's fine does that answer your question well yeah that's kind of the
[56:34.620 --> 56:41.260]  answer I was expecting but when there's so many obvious indicators like 80,000
[56:41.260 --> 56:46.420]  jobs lost in the month of March Wall Street has its worst quarter ever not
[56:46.420 --> 56:53.020]  ever in five years the first quarter of 2008 unemployment and joblessness at all
[56:53.020 --> 56:59.540]  time highs you start to see all these major indicators not just things like
[56:59.540 --> 57:05.700]  corporations losing money or the price of consumer goods going up you see
[57:05.700 --> 57:11.540]  major indicators that not only are we in a recession but that we may be headed
[57:11.540 --> 57:17.660]  towards a depression a total economic depression and they're saying on the
[57:17.660 --> 57:22.780]  news that well maybe we might be in a recession you know then it's almost like
[57:22.780 --> 57:26.660]  they're saying one plus one does not equal to they're saying one plus one
[57:26.660 --> 57:34.180]  equals five and I just don't understand how we could be expected to believe the
[57:34.180 --> 57:40.100]  accuracy of any economic reports coming through the mainstream media when
[57:40.100 --> 57:43.980]  they're telling us well don't equal to I mean if you look at the actual
[57:43.980 --> 57:49.100]  reports most of those are pretty accurate it's the overall conclusion they
[57:49.100 --> 57:53.100]  take from those data they'll take horrible data and no we're not going to
[57:53.100 --> 57:57.140]  look at it then tell us the data shows us everything's fine I appreciate your
[57:57.140 --> 58:02.580]  call we're gonna break for 70 seconds and I'm coming right back to Bud Peggy

[1:00:35.300 --> 1:00:43.620]  air bud good afternoon Alex hi I agree with your statement on Florida and all
[1:00:43.620 --> 1:00:50.540]  of us who are awake and know that Florida is bad for you I don't really agree
[1:00:50.540 --> 1:00:56.820]  with your math mathematician I mean your mathematics so when they speak of one
[1:00:56.820 --> 1:01:04.860]  part per million Florida being okay it's and then they they say point two
[1:01:04.860 --> 1:01:12.660]  fluoride or point two zero two fluoride it's they're speaking to still the one
[1:01:12.660 --> 1:01:18.540]  part per million no they're not but then they say two tenths of one part per
[1:01:18.540 --> 1:01:22.300]  million sir sir I actually looked it up last night as I'm I wanted to be
[1:01:22.300 --> 1:01:29.340]  specific okay when something says zero point one that's a hundredth and then
[1:01:29.340 --> 1:01:35.420]  when it says out from that another then it's a no no no no zero point one is one
[1:01:35.420 --> 1:01:41.580]  tenth are you saying that there is one part per million in toothpaste no that
[1:01:41.580 --> 1:01:48.020]  while you know you said there's two I mean one part per million is acceptable
[1:01:48.020 --> 1:01:53.780]  no I did not say that what would you just say did you say one no no I said they
[1:01:53.780 --> 1:01:58.620]  say that okay you okay you said that they said that one part per million was
[1:01:58.620 --> 1:02:06.260]  acceptable yes sir okay then you also said it's two tenths of one part per
[1:02:06.260 --> 1:02:12.740]  million in our water systems are in a lot of school water systems now two tenths
[1:02:12.740 --> 1:02:18.260]  of one part percent per million is less than one part per million listen I appreciate
[1:02:18.260 --> 1:02:23.340]  your call sir I'll love just look what all I can do is on the website post the
[1:02:23.340 --> 1:02:30.940]  numbers to you okay the water supply has much lower levels this is very simple
[1:02:30.940 --> 1:02:35.220]  instead of making this this hard okay look let's just make this real simple
[1:02:35.220 --> 1:02:38.580]  right now for everybody okay you know what I'm gonna just have an article
[1:02:38.580 --> 1:02:42.180]  written about it and I'll have all the math out there okay we can do it all
[1:02:42.180 --> 1:02:45.860]  the calculator make it very clear for everybody I can even videotape me with a
[1:02:45.860 --> 1:02:52.220]  calculator if you'd like and put it on the web it's very simple what I was
[1:02:52.220 --> 1:02:58.140]  discussing is there is a lot more fluoride in toothpaste and fluoride
[1:02:58.140 --> 1:03:04.700]  treatments and fluoride gums and fluoride pills that they push on elementary
[1:03:04.700 --> 1:03:14.300]  school students then there is in the water okay there is more fluoride in
[1:03:14.300 --> 1:03:22.700]  fluoride treatments in toothpaste in things of that nature then there is in
[1:03:22.700 --> 1:03:30.980]  the water supply that's what I was saying I was saying that it's bad enough to
[1:03:30.980 --> 1:03:36.380]  have one part per million in the average water supply some are higher some are
[1:03:36.380 --> 1:03:40.940]  lower but the average is one part per million Austin says there were one and
[1:03:40.940 --> 1:03:44.060]  a half parts per million but they've done water testing numbers as high or
[1:03:44.060 --> 1:03:49.860]  sometimes it's lower and then I was saying if that's bad for your brain they
[1:03:49.860 --> 1:03:55.380]  say it's good for you though now the dental association and others are saying
[1:03:55.380 --> 1:04:06.140]  it isn't then imagine how bad two parts per hundred is and yes if you have 0.2
[1:04:06.140 --> 1:04:09.780]  you know the health department websites you can read that's what's in these
[1:04:09.780 --> 1:04:19.660]  fluoride treatments and gums some some of them are 0.5 that is 100th sometimes the
[1:04:19.660 --> 1:04:27.140]  simplest math is hard and I know it gets confusing here but that is two parts per
[1:04:27.140 --> 1:04:36.420]  hundred okay well they're right back ladies and gentlemen stay with me look
[1:04:36.420 --> 1:04:39.420]  you can go buy the fluoride treatment at the store and read on the back of the

[1:07:48.340 --> 1:07:56.500]  flag today he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio
[1:07:56.500 --> 1:08:05.300]  network I'm looking at the New York State Health Department and it says that
[1:08:05.300 --> 1:08:14.220]  they give the children 0.2 fluoride treatment the mouthwash the high-powered
[1:08:14.220 --> 1:08:22.300]  syrupy stuff and I know that is extremely extremely strong I need to
[1:08:22.300 --> 1:08:29.620]  call my dad he's a dentist but he just went on vacation a well-deserved one you
[1:08:29.620 --> 1:08:33.100]  know I'll just call his office right now and have them go back and get one of
[1:08:33.100 --> 1:08:37.140]  the big bottles of fluoride treatment and then tell us what it is but on the
[1:08:37.140 --> 1:08:41.340]  back of toothpaste it just says in what order fluoride comes sodium fluoride it
[1:08:41.340 --> 1:08:49.580]  doesn't even say what part the point is it's very toxic and so we can have
[1:08:49.580 --> 1:08:52.380]  arguments about what the health department means by that some of them say
[1:08:52.380 --> 1:08:55.980]  point five some of them say point four point three point two point two is what
[1:08:55.980 --> 1:08:59.980]  most health departments say their fluoride treatment and pills and gum they
[1:08:59.980 --> 1:09:03.740]  push on the kids say you know we got the experts out there how about you all go
[1:09:03.740 --> 1:09:08.180]  call the info for yourself or look it up online and how about we create a thread
[1:09:08.180 --> 1:09:14.980]  on the prisonplanet.com forum and I'll remember and the third hour to go read
[1:09:14.980 --> 1:09:18.900]  some of it on the air and go to links and the research you guys and gals do is
[1:09:18.900 --> 1:09:23.420]  just amazing my point is we know it's a lot higher we know they say if you
[1:09:23.420 --> 1:09:32.620]  swallow a pea mount a pea size amount of toothpaste go to poison control by the
[1:09:32.620 --> 1:09:35.620]  way John I sent it to you three days ago and I forgot to play it do you have
[1:09:35.620 --> 1:09:40.220]  that fluoride clip from the San Diego City Council where they have the top
[1:09:40.220 --> 1:09:45.300]  scientist at the head of a national organization up there talking about how
[1:09:45.300 --> 1:09:51.580]  deadly it is yeah cue that up I had that printed off three days ago his actual
[1:09:51.580 --> 1:09:57.220]  title he's like that former head national toxicologist or something like
[1:09:57.220 --> 1:10:00.660]  that I can't keep track all this data anymore but the point is the head
[1:10:00.660 --> 1:10:06.500]  dentist in Canada who's also a toxicologist like 16 years ago it's
[1:10:06.500 --> 1:10:10.580]  been all over the Canadian news a couple years ago he lobbied to get fluoride
[1:10:10.580 --> 1:10:14.660]  put in but he thought it was sodium fluoride in a small amount then he found
[1:10:14.660 --> 1:10:18.620]  out it was hundreds of times what you need and that wasn't the right floor
[1:10:18.620 --> 1:10:23.140]  under the law they're allowed to put hundreds of other mercury lead arsenic
[1:10:23.140 --> 1:10:29.060]  into it is what they call fluoride isn't fluoride it's it's it's it's toxic
[1:10:29.060 --> 1:10:38.180]  waste from from the manufacture of aluminum nuclear power plant rods and
[1:10:38.180 --> 1:10:46.620]  fertilizer so go ahead and they got a guy from a cancer research Institute
[1:10:46.620 --> 1:10:49.940]  first and then they have in the scientist up there go ahead and play this
[1:10:49.940 --> 1:10:53.180]  there's just hundreds of these on the web but but the top dentist into Canada
[1:10:53.180 --> 1:10:57.860]  then is now apologized he travels all over he said my god this brain damages
[1:10:57.860 --> 1:11:02.500]  people and they knew it why are they doing this he goes they're crazy they're
[1:11:02.500 --> 1:11:11.340]  not crazy they know exactly what they're doing go ahead and roll it fluoride is
[1:11:11.340 --> 1:11:17.940]  an extremely dangerous toxin it's a toxic byproduct of the fertilizer and
[1:11:17.940 --> 1:11:26.860]  the aluminum industry and twice senior voters have rejected it 1954 1968 now
[1:11:26.860 --> 1:11:35.860]  we're trying to put fluoride back in our water and we're dead set against it
[1:11:36.540 --> 1:11:42.700]  hydrofluous acid is not fluoride it is raw untreated hazardous waste from the
[1:11:42.700 --> 1:11:46.500]  pollution scrubbers of the phosphate fertilizer mining industry what
[1:11:46.500 --> 1:11:50.980]  citizen in San Diego would say yes to that and our city council is saying what
[1:11:50.980 --> 1:11:56.260]  there are a number of studies some rather large with 450,000 participating
[1:11:56.260 --> 1:12:01.140]  children showing that African American children suffer off six fold increase in
[1:12:01.140 --> 1:12:06.460]  blood levels of lead and a doubling of the amount of dental fluorosis the CDC
[1:12:06.460 --> 1:12:11.740]  this is their disclaimer fluoridation is safe and healthy and promotes its use
[1:12:11.740 --> 1:12:17.060]  for people of all ages this is a brief outline from the CDC about fluorosis you
[1:12:17.060 --> 1:12:21.180]  can find it on San Diego County dental societies webpage about fluoridation
[1:12:21.180 --> 1:12:25.900]  until now most researchers concluded that fluoride intake during a child's
[1:12:25.900 --> 1:12:30.100]  first 10 to 12 months had very little impact on the developmental condition
[1:12:30.100 --> 1:12:34.300]  and permanent teeth a recent study however has raised the possibility that
[1:12:34.300 --> 1:12:38.820]  fluoride exposure during the first year of life may play a more important role
[1:12:38.820 --> 1:12:44.220]  in the fluorosis and development than was previously understood that means that
[1:12:44.220 --> 1:12:48.980]  the results aren't in yet and we're still giving our kids we're subjecting them
[1:12:48.980 --> 1:12:54.660]  to possible fluorosis even though the results are right the results are in and
[1:12:54.660 --> 1:13:00.940]  it rots holes in your teeth when I got white spots all over your teeth but you
[1:13:00.940 --> 1:13:07.700]  go to the store it says fluorated water added extra fluoride oh because your
[1:13:07.700 --> 1:13:15.980]  baby needs it all right let's go ahead and go to Peggy in Pennsylvania Peggy
[1:13:15.980 --> 1:13:22.020]  you're on the air I'm hi Alex hi I'm glad you're telling the truth about
[1:13:22.020 --> 1:13:28.620]  cavities and teeth in general because I have some more information about
[1:13:28.620 --> 1:13:34.820]  various lies told to the public by food manufacturers one of the biggest lies
[1:13:34.820 --> 1:13:38.700]  that's still being perpetrated even in health food magazines is that saturated
[1:13:38.700 --> 1:13:43.900]  fat is bad for you I'm talking about saturated fat in milk and meat no it's
[1:13:43.900 --> 1:13:47.300]  it's good for your brain and there's literally thousands of studies on that
[1:13:47.300 --> 1:13:52.280]  what's bad is the trans fats the processed fats that are basically like
[1:13:52.280 --> 1:13:57.500]  plastic they're unnatural they're made in a laboratory and if you were to take a
[1:13:57.500 --> 1:14:03.100]  um there was an experiment done by one guy he took a margarine this was in the
[1:14:03.100 --> 1:14:07.780]  30s when it had been around for a while and he took a margarine and set it on
[1:14:07.780 --> 1:14:11.580]  his windowsill the flies wouldn't touch it the bugs wouldn't go near it the
[1:14:11.580 --> 1:14:15.220]  animals wouldn't lick lick off of it in fact nothing happened to it it just sat
[1:14:15.220 --> 1:14:18.340]  there and he said after two years that they collected so much dust so he
[1:14:18.340 --> 1:14:23.500]  threw it away it's not natural and your body when you eat margarine and trans fat
[1:14:23.500 --> 1:14:28.060]  and it goes into your body it makes your cell walls stiff they're supposed to be
[1:14:28.060 --> 1:14:33.260]  softer and pliable which is what like saturated fat is and when they get like
[1:14:33.260 --> 1:14:39.100]  that basically food can't I mean nutrients can't enter into it properly
[1:14:39.100 --> 1:14:45.100]  and when that happens that interferes with all sorts of disease process it
[1:14:45.100 --> 1:14:48.220]  I mean interferes with the healthy processes in your body and sets of
[1:14:48.220 --> 1:14:52.300]  disease such as heart disease that's right and and now they even have to
[1:14:52.300 --> 1:14:57.140]  admit 20 years of statin drugs to suppress cholesterol actually cause
[1:14:57.140 --> 1:15:03.980]  heart attacks cause strokes cause cancer instead when they do the autopsies they
[1:15:03.980 --> 1:15:09.820]  just pull out huge globs in the arteries of people and it is the trans fats it is
[1:15:09.820 --> 1:15:15.620]  the fake cooked up in a laboratory stuff that quote tastes so good and your
[1:15:15.620 --> 1:15:19.180]  body can't process it and it takes your intestines in your arteries and
[1:15:19.180 --> 1:15:22.180]  everything else and it's absolutely admitted and they don't care and they're
[1:15:22.180 --> 1:15:25.740]  going to continue the other thing that they're lying to you about is that they
[1:15:25.740 --> 1:15:30.500]  are telling you if you eat saturated fat you'll gain weight this and of course if
[1:15:30.500 --> 1:15:34.180]  you eat you know 10,000 calories a day you might but if you just eat it like
[1:15:34.180 --> 1:15:38.500]  what for a regular meal yeah look at the Eskimos they eat part of the year 90% of
[1:15:38.500 --> 1:15:42.900]  their diet is a whale blubber and you don't see them being fat or having any
[1:15:42.900 --> 1:15:47.820]  artery disease that's correct in addition sugar and carbohydrates in fact
[1:15:47.820 --> 1:15:53.140]  carbohydrates of any kind are what causes you to gain weight and that's that is
[1:15:53.140 --> 1:15:57.420]  just a fact it is absolutely that sugar or carbohydrate well you need some
[1:15:57.420 --> 1:16:00.220]  carbos you need a balanced diet and I appreciate your call and every point
[1:16:00.220 --> 1:16:07.060]  you're making is documented and true it is absolutely admitted and I have an
[1:16:07.060 --> 1:16:12.220]  uncle my dad's brother was a motorcycle accident he's just fine but he has you
[1:16:12.220 --> 1:16:16.700]  know seizures a few times a year but you in the medical literature I remember
[1:16:16.700 --> 1:16:20.020]  15 years ago reading about it and him talking about it they tell you no eat
[1:16:20.020 --> 1:16:27.860]  eat more fat you know eat more bacon eat more the brain is made the part that
[1:16:27.860 --> 1:16:34.300]  isn't water 70% water is over 90% cholesterol the brain is an electro
[1:16:34.300 --> 1:16:42.740]  chemical oil based computer and that's why they tell people now advanced chess
[1:16:42.740 --> 1:16:46.180]  players and international championships they tell people you know before you
[1:16:46.180 --> 1:16:49.300]  take a test make sure you had a balanced meal and make sure while you're doing
[1:16:49.300 --> 1:16:53.140]  studying you've been getting enough of complex fats you need the whole scale
[1:16:53.140 --> 1:16:57.740]  too much of any fats bad it's all about balance ladies and gentlemen and yes
[1:16:57.740 --> 1:17:03.220]  fats are very good take Scandinavian men they have one of the highest fat
[1:17:03.220 --> 1:17:11.100]  diets of any culture but it's beef it's it's it's organic beef and they just had
[1:17:11.100 --> 1:17:16.860]  a study came out yesterday the longest-lived men in the world or Icelandic
[1:17:16.860 --> 1:17:23.220]  and the second longest-lived group is also on the mainland one of the
[1:17:23.220 --> 1:17:26.980]  Scandinavian nations I need to pull that up we posted it on info wars and then
[1:17:26.980 --> 1:17:34.060]  the third most long-lived of the Japanese men and it's because they get up
[1:17:34.060 --> 1:17:38.380]  early they work all day they're big into exercise but they also get a balanced
[1:17:38.380 --> 1:17:42.580]  you know balanced meal that they're eating and they eat a lot of fat ladies
[1:17:42.580 --> 1:17:48.540]  and gentlemen they had a lot of fat most northern people do because it's a good
[1:17:48.540 --> 1:17:56.140]  energy source the Eskimos the Anuets the Nordics are all big fat eaters the
[1:17:56.140 --> 1:18:01.660]  Nordics eat a lot of whale not anymore but really let the Eskimos he says a
[1:18:01.660 --> 1:18:03.980]  few countries still allow whaling I'm not saying whaling is a good thing I'm
[1:18:03.980 --> 1:18:09.540]  just saying pure blubber they have an appetite for succulent fat steaks not
[1:18:09.540 --> 1:18:14.860]  me what's the saying one of them could eat no fat one of them could eat no
[1:18:14.860 --> 1:18:20.900]  thin so together they clean the platter let's go ahead and talk to Jimmy in
[1:18:20.900 --> 1:18:26.100]  California you're on the air Jimmy hey Alex thanks for letting me jack into the
[1:18:26.100 --> 1:18:31.900]  world-wide broadcast on info wars dot com hey that last caller really makes the
[1:18:31.900 --> 1:18:39.060]  phrase I can't believe it's not butter but change the whole commercial for me
[1:18:39.060 --> 1:18:44.020]  hey listen last night I noticed you were when you were on George Norrie he seemed
[1:18:44.020 --> 1:18:50.220]  like he was leaning a little bit in the direction of Ted Turner when he was
[1:18:50.220 --> 1:18:53.140]  saying he was trying to get you seem like he was trying to get to go down the
[1:18:53.140 --> 1:18:58.300]  road of admitting that there was more people than are necessary
[1:18:58.300 --> 1:19:01.780]  well nothing George's he said what he was doing he said I'm gonna play devils
[1:19:01.780 --> 1:19:06.260]  advocate that way it's not just a one-sided show and he said you know are
[1:19:06.260 --> 1:19:11.420]  there too many people and then I got to answer the question hey can I ask you
[1:19:11.420 --> 1:19:17.380]  one more question sure I'm curious about why why there seems to be sort of an
[1:19:17.380 --> 1:19:22.980]  extreme silence about Barack Obama I mean it seems like there's a lot of red
[1:19:22.980 --> 1:19:27.620]  meat inside of his compound as far as his background is concerned and don't
[1:19:27.620 --> 1:19:31.260]  really hear a lot of coverage about it what do you think well stay there I'm
[1:19:31.260 --> 1:19:34.420]  gonna let you have the floor and you can talk about the dirt and Barack Obama's
[1:19:34.420 --> 1:19:41.780]  background I'll tell you why I don't cover it much when we get back

[1:20:57.060 --> 1:21:02.180]  are overly acidic due to stress acidic diet and lack of exercise pH balance is
[1:21:02.180 --> 1:21:05.860]  the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health as well as prevention of

[1:21:18.100 --> 1:21:22.300]  acidic the fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment
[1:21:22.300 --> 1:21:26.100]  fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and

[1:24:43.460 --> 1:25:13.420]  you gotta love it
[1:25:14.460 --> 1:25:21.860]  I love this music video showing a big ball crashing into the Berlin wall and I
[1:25:21.860 --> 1:25:25.580]  made the point yesterday but I'll make it again the globalist did stage the
[1:25:25.580 --> 1:25:29.540]  falling of the wall they decided to bring it down because the rebellion was
[1:25:29.540 --> 1:25:34.020]  already so great they capitulated they gave in then they tried to control it
[1:25:34.020 --> 1:25:38.340]  but it still didn't work for them that's because artists and musicians and
[1:25:38.340 --> 1:25:43.020]  activists in Germany all over the world just started rebelling and even that
[1:25:43.020 --> 1:25:46.060]  incredible police state the Stasi we're running that our governments tried to
[1:25:46.060 --> 1:25:50.620]  recreate by even hiring Marcus Wolf is now falling apart
[1:25:50.620 --> 1:25:55.940]  well I get into Barack Obama Barack Obama has the big New Brzezinski as his
[1:25:55.940 --> 1:26:03.580]  handler he has all these other globalist his cfr his wife cfr he has
[1:26:03.580 --> 1:26:10.100]  said that he's not gonna get rid of after a get he's total new world order it
[1:26:10.100 --> 1:26:14.420]  doesn't matter if it's Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton or John McCain they're
[1:26:14.420 --> 1:26:17.940]  all New World Order now Hillary's been involved in more murders more
[1:26:17.940 --> 1:26:21.780]  corruption she's clearly more evil she's been around longer he'll make his bones
[1:26:21.780 --> 1:26:25.940]  I'm sure and you know become more wicked more like the emperors he gets more
[1:26:25.940 --> 1:26:32.780]  power our McCain is completely out of his mind you have to give it to Obama
[1:26:32.780 --> 1:26:35.740]  that he did vote against the war but other than that and he's got all these
[1:26:35.740 --> 1:26:40.100]  communists in his background and he's got corrupt all you know money in his
[1:26:40.100 --> 1:26:44.300]  background and he's got all the big brokerage houses in his background but
[1:26:44.300 --> 1:26:47.500]  we don't I mean I didn't talk about Bill Clinton's last year and a year and a
[1:26:47.500 --> 1:26:50.220]  half an office because we know Bill Clinton's evil we know Bill Clinton's
[1:26:50.220 --> 1:26:57.500]  bad we know Bill Clinton is doing all these terrible things and I just call
[1:26:57.500 --> 1:27:00.940]  him a puppet you know minimizing them down to puppets they don't run anything
[1:27:00.940 --> 1:27:05.620]  only if we got a Ron Paul in where he could actually use the office of the
[1:27:05.620 --> 1:27:09.300]  presidency to cut back on the New World Order and he uses a bully pulpit to
[1:27:09.300 --> 1:27:13.700]  wipe people up would it have value so I hope that answers your question Jimmy it
[1:27:13.700 --> 1:27:20.380]  really is a distraction overall well I mean is you know I mean do you do you
[1:27:20.380 --> 1:27:25.340]  think that the the Brzezinski clan that you know the cauldrons do you think
[1:27:25.340 --> 1:27:30.100]  these people are already assuming the position and controlling some of the
[1:27:30.100 --> 1:27:33.740]  world events that are going on right now because I mean it's you know it
[1:27:33.740 --> 1:27:37.860]  similarly looks a lot like the events you know taking place during the Carter
[1:27:37.860 --> 1:27:41.780]  administration I mean just with the whole inflation the economy yeah that's
[1:27:41.780 --> 1:27:46.260]  right I mean they use they'll use Barack Obama whoever goes in as their front
[1:27:46.260 --> 1:27:49.940]  and then four to eight years later and I appreciate your call they get everything
[1:27:49.940 --> 1:27:54.500]  blamed on them and then the next puppet comes in instead of the people
[1:27:54.500 --> 1:27:57.580]  realizing it's the elite that never left office it's the elite that are
[1:27:57.580 --> 1:28:02.580]  falsely in control of our government at the bare minimum since 1913 and fully
[1:28:02.580 --> 1:28:06.980]  since the National Security Act of 47 and then Kennedy tried to buck that so
[1:28:06.980 --> 1:28:12.660]  they blew his head off so instead of them always tricking us with a new puppet
[1:28:12.660 --> 1:28:18.020]  let's see past the puppet let's go ahead and talk to Ian and Canada you're on
[1:28:18.020 --> 1:28:23.860]  the air yeah hey Alex I was just wondering you were talking about Ted
[1:28:23.860 --> 1:28:29.300]  Turner and bio viruses earlier or sorry like bioengineered viruses earlier and
[1:28:29.300 --> 1:28:34.700]  I was just wondering what you thought of possibly instead of attacking our
[1:28:34.700 --> 1:28:39.020]  bodies with bio virus or with the bioengineered virus but attacking our
[1:28:39.020 --> 1:28:43.060]  food I was thinking that they'd probably attack our food with the bio virus
[1:28:43.060 --> 1:28:47.740]  they've been doing that Iran's had all sorts of clear bio weapons hit their
[1:28:47.740 --> 1:28:52.540]  wheat hit their corn hit their crops really no in the CIA's always flown over
[1:28:52.540 --> 1:28:56.940]  and dumped out bio weapons chemicals locust on who they don't like yeah yeah

[1:35:36.820 --> 1:35:45.300]  they just did a bunch of research Mike did here in the office and he found
[1:35:45.300 --> 1:35:50.740]  different university studies in Australia in Brazil he was just doing the
[1:35:50.740 --> 1:35:56.820]  search for he's a paramedic you got sick of it but he's a pretty smart guy for
[1:35:56.820 --> 1:36:02.940]  looking this stuff up a lot of medical training he looked up levels of fluoride
[1:36:02.940 --> 1:36:11.460]  and here is in New York New York ages 6 and older 10 milliliter 5 milliliter of
[1:36:11.460 --> 1:36:18.060]  0.2 sodium fluoride solution so there it is and it says that they don't say what
[1:36:18.060 --> 1:36:25.660]  that means so we looked it up we're gonna do more research on this this is the
[1:36:25.660 --> 1:36:31.060]  study here I've got is out of Brazil oral B and all the other brands and this
[1:36:31.060 --> 1:36:38.020]  university study found that in many cases it was hundreds of times what the
[1:36:38.020 --> 1:36:44.740]  bottle even said this is incredible all this data we're gonna get all this
[1:36:44.740 --> 1:36:47.460]  posted on the website I'm gonna do a big article I'm gonna do a lot of research
[1:36:47.460 --> 1:36:55.780]  on this this weekend holy mackerel so I'm here reading this on air and just
[1:36:55.780 --> 1:37:01.780]  pausing oh they put you this way one part per million fries your brain really
[1:37:01.780 --> 1:37:05.820]  bad for you we're talking about parts per thousand ladies and gentlemen bare
[1:37:05.820 --> 1:37:15.540]  minimum this is just amazing absolutely mind blowing that these type of things
[1:37:15.540 --> 1:37:28.740]  are happening okay let me go ahead and get into the economic stack here this is
[1:37:28.740 --> 1:37:32.300]  Bloomberg financial today
[1:37:34.220 --> 1:37:39.900]  church cow once a dollar bull sees long-term decline the dollar will fall
[1:37:39.900 --> 1:37:46.140]  in the coming years as the u.s. seeks a weak currency to boost exports and cut
[1:37:46.140 --> 1:37:52.660]  its trade and current accounts deficits said Paul chertow a former head of
[1:37:52.660 --> 1:37:58.100]  currency strategy at the Bank of Tokyo missile be she ufj one of the biggest
[1:37:58.100 --> 1:38:06.260]  banks in Japan the u.s. currency will drop to between 80 and 85 again this
[1:38:06.260 --> 1:38:12.580]  quarter the lowest since 95 chertow said who retired this week of 27 year career
[1:38:12.580 --> 1:38:20.060]  on global foreign exchange said in an interview it will also fall to 1.65
[1:38:20.060 --> 1:38:26.660]  against the euro and may trade as low as 170 that would be five cents weaker than
[1:38:26.660 --> 1:38:30.460]  it is now at all-time lows currently the dollar will go weaker over time said
[1:38:30.460 --> 1:38:37.180]  chertow 60 who currently predicts the u.s. currency appreciation the 1980s a
[1:38:37.180 --> 1:38:43.300]  forecast he said earned him reputation as a dollar bull so he correctly
[1:38:43.300 --> 1:38:48.940]  predicted the appreciation that is the increase in value the Americans like the
[1:38:48.940 --> 1:38:51.780]  weakness of the dollar because it improves the competitive position of the
[1:38:51.780 --> 1:38:56.780]  u.s. which is one of the few things going for the u.s. economy but we have no real
[1:38:56.780 --> 1:39:00.180]  industry so it doesn't help the Americans also have to recognize there has to be
[1:39:00.180 --> 1:39:05.420]  weakness in domestic demand the dollar which has lost 14 percent against the
[1:39:05.420 --> 1:39:12.540]  yen in the last year alone was at 102 38 against the Japanese currency but has
[1:39:12.540 --> 1:39:21.540]  fallen further it just goes into it so that's one of the top currency experts
[1:39:21.540 --> 1:39:25.980]  in the world and he goes on and on you can read the article we got a link to it
[1:39:25.980 --> 1:39:33.380]  up on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com not good news there oil edges up as
[1:39:33.380 --> 1:39:40.740]  dollars slumps again traders await us payrolls and oil recovered yesterday's
[1:39:40.740 --> 1:39:44.300]  losses as the dollar turned lower against the euro making dollar price oil
[1:39:44.300 --> 1:39:48.380]  cheaper for holders of foreign currencies see it's the dollar devaluation
[1:39:48.380 --> 1:39:51.140]  that makes oil go up meanwhile they have the oil executives and I'm not seeing
[1:39:51.140 --> 1:39:54.980]  they're lily white they're very corrupt and they're part of a cartel and but by
[1:39:54.980 --> 1:40:03.060]  the way the oil execs yesterday properly said hey we just sell from the cartel
[1:40:03.060 --> 1:40:10.020]  that the cartel OPEC is jacking up the price artificially and they said but the
[1:40:10.020 --> 1:40:13.900]  dollars also dropping so it's a perfect storm and they went on to add that we're
[1:40:13.900 --> 1:40:18.540]  just the resellers I mean OPEC's more than 90% of production yeah there's
[1:40:18.540 --> 1:40:25.100]  a wildcatting in Colorado and Texas and off the coast and the Gulf and all over
[1:40:25.100 --> 1:40:28.180]  the place but those are small wells compared to the type of oil you know
[1:40:28.180 --> 1:40:32.700]  sweet crude it's almost like gasoline it's so refined so pure just coming right
[1:40:32.700 --> 1:40:37.940]  out of the ground and giant three foot around pipes biggest pipes you see in the
[1:40:37.940 --> 1:40:44.620]  US out of a single well or six inches sometimes a foot but I'm digressing the
[1:40:44.620 --> 1:40:56.340]  larger issue here is that they are issuing more liquidity they are printing
[1:40:56.340 --> 1:41:00.260]  more money they are driving down the value of the dollar that fundamental is
[1:41:00.260 --> 1:41:07.500]  only intensifying and the general public is buying the controlled media spin by
[1:41:07.500 --> 1:41:13.820]  thinking that they can judge the health of the dollar and the economy on a week
[1:41:13.820 --> 1:41:18.820]  to week basis I mean the dollar slides to 156 against the euro and then it goes
[1:41:18.820 --> 1:41:24.140]  back to 155 and the headlines are dollars recovered the country strong
[1:41:24.140 --> 1:41:30.140]  everything's fine because it gains back less than 1% of its value and then the
[1:41:30.140 --> 1:41:36.420]  next week loses it again and then is set to plunge even further that is the the
[1:41:36.420 --> 1:41:40.420]  year-long graph is going straight down the five-year graph is going straight
[1:41:40.420 --> 1:41:45.740]  down the seven-year graph is going straight down but the media focuses in
[1:41:45.740 --> 1:41:50.580]  on the daily and weekly graphs and they're not lying out right by showing you
[1:41:50.580 --> 1:41:54.420]  a daily or weekly graph they're telling the truth that yeah the dollars up when
[1:41:54.420 --> 1:41:58.140]  it goes up half a cent but then the next week it drops another cent then they
[1:41:58.140 --> 1:42:03.380]  don't really talk too much about that that's where the manipulation is now the
[1:42:03.380 --> 1:42:07.820]  oil companies did artificially buy up 200 plus refineries in the US their own
[1:42:07.820 --> 1:42:12.460]  memos came out in 2000 in lawsuits AP reported we've written articles about
[1:42:12.460 --> 1:42:17.780]  that at prisonplanet.com they did come in and buy up refineries to create an
[1:42:17.780 --> 1:42:22.820]  artificial bottleneck to add some of their own padding in domestically and
[1:42:22.820 --> 1:42:28.740]  when Atlantic Richfield and others found oil reserves larger than Saudi
[1:42:28.740 --> 1:42:34.140]  Arabia's in the 70s and that's now leaked out and not just been you know
[1:42:34.140 --> 1:42:40.540]  talked about by Lindsey Williams but by oil execs and in and in oil publications
[1:42:40.540 --> 1:42:45.740]  and because they're in a deal with the cartel to keep prices down so they're
[1:42:45.740 --> 1:42:49.140]  all colluding together but it isn't the oil companies alone they're doing it
[1:42:49.140 --> 1:42:55.820]  that's that's my point and payroll data came out payrolls are dropping Fed
[1:42:55.820 --> 1:43:02.940]  interest rates games could destroy the dollar this is the Detroit News Federal
[1:43:02.940 --> 1:43:06.420]  Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has reduced the key federal funds the rate six times
[1:43:06.420 --> 1:43:10.860]  in as many months reducing the cost of major borrowers significantly this
[1:43:10.860 --> 1:43:14.900]  combined with providing 270 million in funding plus 30 billion additional
[1:43:14.900 --> 1:43:18.820]  guarantees for JP Morgan Chase and Bear Stearns Co which means they're in
[1:43:18.820 --> 1:43:23.380]  trouble helicopter Ben is living up to the nickname he earned after he remarked
[1:43:23.380 --> 1:43:27.460]  in 2002 speech that he would stave off recession even if he had to drop money
[1:43:27.460 --> 1:43:31.300]  from helicopters to do it the results of these policies have been destructive the
[1:43:31.300 --> 1:43:35.180]  dollar is collapsing not only against foreign currencies we now are a part of
[1:43:35.180 --> 1:43:38.540]  the Canadian dollar and rocketing towards actually the Canadian dollars above
[1:43:38.540 --> 1:43:43.020]  us towards a two-to-one deficit against the euro but also against commodities
[1:43:43.020 --> 1:43:47.740]  gold was passing a thousand dollar landmark silver $20 even industrial
[1:43:47.740 --> 1:43:51.660]  metals like copper and zinc are fetching record prices now a spike in
[1:43:51.660 --> 1:43:55.580]  particular commodities say for instance hundred dollar per barrel oil can be
[1:43:55.580 --> 1:43:59.540]  attributed to the shortage but when they all move dramatically and
[1:43:59.540 --> 1:44:03.860]  simultaneously it's the purchasing power of our money that has gone down now
[1:44:03.860 --> 1:44:06.620]  when they start admitting this in the Wall Street Journal in the Detroit news
[1:44:06.620 --> 1:44:12.180]  we're in trouble because then that does destroy confidence see you're getting the
[1:44:12.180 --> 1:44:15.620]  inside angle the bankers have that they've been positioning for five six
[1:44:15.620 --> 1:44:19.700]  years their money into commodities and out of the dollar that's why we said hey
[1:44:19.700 --> 1:44:24.820]  they're abandoning ship going to lifeboats five years ago you see then
[1:44:24.820 --> 1:44:28.300]  we got confirmation three years ago out of Bilderberg and then on a Davos two
[1:44:28.300 --> 1:44:32.220]  years ago and we said get folks get to the lifeboats they already left they're
[1:44:32.220 --> 1:44:36.820]  already way off from the ship the ship's now listing about to capsize get off the
[1:44:36.820 --> 1:44:40.940]  ship but if we could talk to the whole country it probably caused the
[1:44:40.940 --> 1:44:45.700]  depression tomorrow it's coming but the idiot yuppie confidence is allowing you
[1:44:45.700 --> 1:44:50.620]  to extricate and evacuate as well you might as well do what the globalists are
[1:44:50.620 --> 1:44:54.420]  doing I mean the vice president a couple years ago dumped what was it six
[1:44:54.420 --> 1:44:58.660]  million dollars of all of his dollars he dumped all his dollars and you know
[1:44:58.660 --> 1:45:05.140]  that he had in the bank and bought euros and swiss bonds oh man I'm starting to
[1:45:05.140 --> 1:45:10.900]  get really mad here I mean I consciously know all of this but then when I
[1:45:10.900 --> 1:45:17.460]  read it just in the open okay we got some 9-11 news coming up dealing with
[1:45:17.460 --> 1:45:24.420]  Mukasey and all of his corruption the attorney general's in a lot of trouble but
[1:45:24.420 --> 1:45:31.020]  before we do that I wanted to bring Ted in here gold is rocketed up today and
[1:45:31.020 --> 1:45:35.700]  I'm telling you this is a buying opportunity because all of the fundamentals
[1:45:35.700 --> 1:45:41.680]  say that gold's gonna go well above 2000 just to reach its dollar parity with
[1:45:41.680 --> 1:45:54.580]  1980s previous high you know goldy a hit in 850 in 1980 at its all-time high well
[1:45:54.580 --> 1:45:59.380]  for inflation we're talking two thousand three hundred plus dollars now because
[1:45:59.380 --> 1:46:03.580]  the dollars have been devalued more so my point is at least gold can't be
[1:46:03.580 --> 1:46:09.260]  completely devalued it's real and when the dollar folds it won't be that gold's
[1:46:09.260 --> 1:46:12.980]  five thousand dollars an ounce which you can conceivably go to but two thousands
[1:46:12.980 --> 1:46:17.340]  conservative the fact is it's not a question of it but when this bubble will
[1:46:17.340 --> 1:46:20.900]  play out it is playing out you're seeing all the real effects on the
[1:46:20.900 --> 1:46:25.380]  streets and when it does play out next week next month two years three years
[1:46:25.380 --> 1:46:32.660]  from now we don't know we just know it's going to happen and god help us Ted we
[1:46:32.660 --> 1:46:39.100]  only had about three minutes I keep babbling here it's just that if I had
[1:46:39.100 --> 1:46:42.660]  extra funds right now and I got a little bit by enough to buy some silver but
[1:46:42.660 --> 1:46:46.060]  you're basically out of that I would move into gold right now I'm gonna try to
[1:46:46.060 --> 1:46:52.620]  buy a few coins but Ted people are crazy because you've got you've got gold
[1:46:52.620 --> 1:46:57.700]  when it went to its new low last week and now it's already gone up 50 bucks or
[1:46:57.700 --> 1:47:04.300]  something so what should people do to me Alex it's obvious I mean gold was this
[1:47:04.300 --> 1:47:07.700]  the sell-off came from the central banks they're trying to prop the dollar back
[1:47:07.700 --> 1:47:10.820]  up again but we know this dollar is going to be doomed and it's going to be
[1:47:10.820 --> 1:47:14.540]  dead so when they sell it they're creating an opportunity for us to get
[1:47:14.540 --> 1:47:18.180]  into something at a lower price it's like a it's like they put it on sale
[1:47:18.180 --> 1:47:21.660]  today they were able to sell some of their stock to you for less than what it
[1:47:21.660 --> 1:47:27.060]  was going for in the market now's the time to be getting in right now you do
[1:47:27.060 --> 1:47:31.380]  this the same fundamentals that created the rush for gold here just two three
[1:47:31.380 --> 1:47:35.940]  weeks ago are still here and just like Jesse Ventura and Ron Paul and
[1:47:35.940 --> 1:47:40.380]  everybody else who's lining up I read economists all the time everybody can
[1:47:40.380 --> 1:47:44.060]  say the same thing they're all pointing at the same thing that simple I remember
[1:47:44.060 --> 1:47:50.140]  when gold was 265 on the show and then it went up to 400 went back to 350 I
[1:47:50.140 --> 1:47:53.700]  said buy buy use and they and people generally don't they wait till it's
[1:47:53.700 --> 1:47:58.420]  skyrocketing then it goes to 500 drops back down to 450 I say buy buy they
[1:47:58.420 --> 1:48:02.860]  don't they wait till it's at 550 then it goes back down to 500 I say buy buy they
[1:48:02.860 --> 1:48:07.860]  don't they buy when it goes to 600 then it goes to 700 it drops back down to 625
[1:48:07.860 --> 1:48:13.700]  I say buy buy they don't they wait till it goes to 800 ladies and gentlemen gold
[1:48:13.700 --> 1:48:17.540]  is only gonna go up it may go up or down a little bit as it but it's already
[1:48:17.540 --> 1:48:21.540]  found its bottom and Kitco and others are almost always right they're saying
[1:48:21.540 --> 1:48:24.740]  it's gonna start racing back up again they predicted three weeks ago it would
[1:48:24.740 --> 1:48:27.700]  go down in a week it did because the central bank said they were gonna dump
[1:48:27.700 --> 1:48:32.580]  their gold ladies and gentlemen tell them about the offer you've got Ted yeah
[1:48:32.580 --> 1:48:36.140]  right now it's the same thing I offered yesterday but gold's even up higher I
[1:48:36.140 --> 1:48:42.500]  have British sovereigns right now at $247 a coin that is a steal we also have
[1:48:42.500 --> 1:48:47.420]  the Frank coin right now they're at 197 Alex there's never been a time since
[1:48:47.420 --> 1:48:51.580]  1980 that I've been in this business where I haven't been able to sell gold or
[1:48:51.580 --> 1:48:56.020]  silver but I ran out of silver to sell give that give that a thought in your
[1:48:56.020 --> 1:48:59.700]  in your head for just a minute to think about the supply has that ever happened
[1:48:59.700 --> 1:49:03.740]  to you Ted never I've never been in a position where I couldn't sell how many
[1:49:03.740 --> 1:49:09.060]  years 24 years or is it well it's coming up on it's coming up on 30 now wow you
[1:49:09.060 --> 1:49:13.060]  know and and so that's that's the kind of market that we're in right now the
[1:49:13.060 --> 1:49:17.580]  supply is very tight the supply and gold is tight as well the the central
[1:49:17.580 --> 1:49:21.740]  banks have been pushing down the prices of gold and silver to the point where
[1:49:21.740 --> 1:49:26.020]  their mining production stopped so now we're now we have short supply all over
[1:49:26.020 --> 1:49:30.380]  the place and and it's no surprise to me that when the dollar starts falling the
[1:49:30.380 --> 1:49:34.620]  supply the supply chain drops because no you can't just turn on a silver mine
[1:49:34.620 --> 1:49:38.220]  it you know what it takes to do it you have to buy all those trucks and hire
[1:49:38.220 --> 1:49:47.820]  the people give them the number Chad it's 1-800-686-2237 again it's 1-800-686-2237
[1:49:47.820 --> 1:49:52.300]  yet you really do need to get involved now Alex I every now and then I get
[1:49:52.300 --> 1:49:55.500]  somebody that calls me they're concerned that things have dropped a little bit hey
[1:49:55.500 --> 1:50:00.500]  wake up man the the same problems that occurred here just three weeks ago or
[1:50:00.500 --> 1:50:03.900]  right here right now facing us and we're gonna see the gold and silver go up as
[1:50:03.900 --> 1:50:09.660]  the dollar 800-686-2237 it's racing back up use this as a buying
[1:50:09.660 --> 1:50:21.020]  opportunity 1-800-686-2237 1-800-686-2237 you have got gold at
[1:50:21.020 --> 1:50:27.220]  what 40 something bucks marked in I mean so so you secured gold though a what a

[1:54:42.980 --> 1:54:53.900]  world was not my home and memories take me back again when I was young and
[1:54:53.900 --> 1:55:03.660]  grandma was when she guided me boy I remember that it brings back memories
[1:55:03.660 --> 1:55:10.180]  anything we didn't have we didn't really need to remember when the roads were dirt
[1:55:10.180 --> 1:55:17.300]  out there by the farm all right going back to Ted and next hour your calls
[1:55:17.300 --> 1:55:22.900]  totally jam-packed news on Ventura huge developments there on Ted Turner I
[1:55:22.900 --> 1:55:27.100]  haven't even gotten into it we just covered some of the economy Ted the
[1:55:27.100 --> 1:55:31.420]  fundamentals are there gold is over nine hundred and ten dollars an ounce
[1:55:31.420 --> 1:55:36.060]  right now this is a buying opportunity people are going to kick themselves if
[1:55:36.060 --> 1:55:38.860]  they don't move into it now you know I bought gold and was right at a thousand
[1:55:38.860 --> 1:55:43.420]  and I'm happy as a pig has also bought it when it was 300 happy as a pig in mud
[1:55:43.420 --> 1:55:49.660]  I have another saying I was about to say because they could devalue the currency
[1:55:49.660 --> 1:55:53.340]  I got in the bank any day down to nothing and they are at least I've got some
[1:55:53.340 --> 1:55:56.620]  security and that's what this comes down to and you've got great buys tell them
[1:55:56.620 --> 1:56:00.220]  those coins again Ted yeah sure well we do have the British sovereign right now
[1:56:00.220 --> 1:56:06.220]  it's at 247 I also have the Frank coin at 197 one of the things I'd like to
[1:56:06.220 --> 1:56:09.900]  bring up Alex I know we just have a real quick short period of time here but
[1:56:09.900 --> 1:56:13.540]  when I started in 1980 the Hunt Brothers trying to corner the marketplace at that
[1:56:13.540 --> 1:56:18.740]  time I could sell junk silver as much as I wanted I could get old BU coins I
[1:56:18.740 --> 1:56:23.140]  could get silver dollars I get all that stuff without any trouble and here we
[1:56:23.140 --> 1:56:28.260]  are in the year 2008 and I can't get any supply that's because the central banks
[1:56:28.260 --> 1:56:32.060]  have basically shut down the mining production not only of silver but also
[1:56:32.060 --> 1:56:37.180]  of gold back in just a few years ago when I hit about that 200 dollars an
[1:56:37.180 --> 1:56:40.860]  ounce range it's a byproduct of other materials that they're taken out of the
[1:56:40.860 --> 1:56:44.500]  ground now and in order to go right right straight back to strip mining and
[1:56:44.500 --> 1:56:48.340]  silver again it's going to take a lot and same with gold it takes a lot of
[1:56:48.340 --> 1:56:51.260]  effort and a lot of time and of course you've all let's explain the
[1:56:51.260 --> 1:56:55.260]  infrastructure is shut down because the bankers drove down the price to nothing
[1:56:55.260 --> 1:56:59.740]  and then documents came out in an intent to buy up all the gold companies to
[1:56:59.740 --> 1:57:04.980]  later have a bull market but now the infrastructure is not there jewelry
[1:57:04.980 --> 1:57:08.460]  makers have just basically stopped selling gold that's been in the news now
[1:57:08.460 --> 1:57:12.140]  they've rushed back in greedily right now to buy because they know it's going to
[1:57:12.140 --> 1:57:15.540]  be going back up yeah that's exactly what's going on Alex is just not enough
[1:57:15.540 --> 1:57:19.020]  supply to meet demand and that's why the prices are going up and that's why it'll
[1:57:19.020 --> 1:57:22.740]  continue to go up plus also the United States debt hasn't been erased either
[1:57:22.740 --> 1:57:27.380]  that's eaten us alive right now and but I just talked about one of the you know
[1:57:27.380 --> 1:57:31.500]  the head of the Misha Bishi Bank you know their currency expert who just retired
[1:57:31.500 --> 1:57:35.340]  and he just said look the dollars toast I hope that's not the case but
[1:57:35.340 --> 1:57:39.220]  unfortunately it is already toast it's already been devalued by 60 plus percent
[1:57:39.220 --> 1:57:42.820]  against the euro and now they're saying it's going to go down further give Ted
[1:57:42.820 --> 1:57:49.060]  and his brokers a call 800-686-2237 so you got gold coins Ted you're saying no
[1:57:49.060 --> 1:57:53.300]  silver right now you might be able if you got little tiny amounts of money you
[1:57:53.300 --> 1:57:55.980]  might be able to get into little tiny bits of this and that that I can get
[1:57:55.980 --> 1:57:59.180]  I'm just not going to make a promise that I can ship something that I can't
[1:57:59.180 --> 1:58:02.820]  people want to buy you literally almost have nothing in your vault silver wise
[1:58:02.820 --> 1:58:06.700]  it's just it's dry as a bone right now I can't believe it I mean remember two
[1:58:06.700 --> 1:58:12.820]  weeks ago the headline 12 major distributors are out yeah yeah that's what
[1:58:12.820 --> 1:58:15.580]  that's what's going on I'm pushing all over the place trying to find this stuff
[1:58:15.580 --> 1:58:21.100]  it's tough very tough out there 1-800-686-2237 if you'd like to take
[1:58:21.100 --> 1:58:23.980]  advantage of any one of these absolutely Ted thanks for coming on yeah
[1:58:23.980 --> 1:58:27.980]  okay okay we're gonna come back cover the news stay with us but give Ted a call
[1:58:27.980 --> 1:58:41.860]  800-686-2237 you are listening to GCN visit GCN live comm today it is a big
[1:58:41.860 --> 1:58:49.260]  idea a new world order in the near future earth is dominated by a powerful

[2:00:15.820 --> 2:00:21.980]  Ventura play some TV newscast clips also have a clip of a fellow convicted at the
[2:00:21.980 --> 2:00:27.100]  university the university only flies the Mexican flag in hatred of America and
[2:00:27.100 --> 2:00:30.700]  that's what it's all about the destruction of the sovereignty they're just
[2:00:30.700 --> 2:00:36.460]  using Mexico as a set piece to get it done and he has been convicted and they
[2:00:36.460 --> 2:00:39.660]  almost sent him to prison for a hate crime they said it's very hateful not to
[2:00:39.660 --> 2:00:44.500]  worship the Mexican flag of course you go to a Mexican soccer game after 9 11
[2:00:44.500 --> 2:00:47.660]  they were cheering and chanting of some have been lauding and burning American
[2:00:47.660 --> 2:00:52.620]  flags but I'm just supposed to say that doesn't exist and just shut up and love

[2:01:09.740 --> 2:01:13.580]  filled mouths and love the death of this country that's what the government's
[2:01:13.580 --> 2:01:28.580]  there for okay Ted Turner last night I was on coast-to-coast AM George Norrie
[2:01:28.580 --> 2:01:31.180]  had me on to talk about this and I kicked myself I'm like man I had this
[2:01:31.180 --> 2:01:34.860]  article and I didn't even cover it and why is that it's because when you're so
[2:01:34.860 --> 2:01:39.220]  close to this problem and it becomes so past say that Ted Turner wants world
[2:01:39.220 --> 2:01:43.500]  population reduction that when we all just kind of forget about it and accept
[2:01:43.500 --> 2:01:49.220]  that that's a fact but remember the general public doesn't know that and so
[2:01:49.220 --> 2:01:52.220]  George had seen in game where we exposed Ted Turner for these beliefs and
[2:01:52.220 --> 2:01:57.020]  saying 95% of us have to be gotten rid of and because we had me on but in the
[2:01:57.020 --> 2:02:02.460]  time I had I get so excited I never ran through my basic points some of my
[2:02:02.460 --> 2:02:07.140]  basic points I want to go over those but but here's the famous quote in
[2:02:07.140 --> 2:02:14.380]  Audubon magazine by Ted Turner a total population of 250 to 300 million
[2:02:14.380 --> 2:02:20.740]  people a 95% decline of present levels would be ideal here's a Prince Philip
[2:02:20.740 --> 2:02:27.180]  this was in the Deutsche Press Argentaire DPA in 1988 said in the event
[2:02:27.180 --> 2:02:31.140]  that I am reincarnated I would like to return as a deadly virus in order to
[2:02:31.140 --> 2:02:37.140]  contribute something to solve overpopulation I just want to add the
[2:02:37.140 --> 2:02:40.300]  point that Ted Turner has five children but he thinks the rest of us should be
[2:02:40.300 --> 2:02:44.740]  limited to one Ted Turner science is completely unproven concerning global
[2:02:44.740 --> 2:02:50.820]  warming Turner claims carbon dioxide CO2 rising kills plants when every study
[2:02:50.820 --> 2:02:56.460]  shows it does the opposite the earth has had 14 times higher CO2 most the time
[2:02:56.460 --> 2:03:00.420]  it's about 10 times higher from the ice core studies and the plants grow faster
[2:03:00.420 --> 2:03:05.260]  much healthier live longer produce more oxygen and then animals that's us mammals
[2:03:05.260 --> 2:03:13.860]  insects the entire animal kingdom lizards reptiles amphibians they all live
[2:03:13.860 --> 2:03:21.820]  longer carbon dioxide is a good guess you know you can they did this in
[2:03:21.820 --> 2:03:26.740]  chemistry in high school the teacher read the scientific name for salt sodium
[2:03:26.740 --> 2:03:30.500]  chloride he said I'm gonna make you all drink sodium chloride what do you think
[2:03:30.500 --> 2:03:33.980]  of that and I was like no that's poison when he goes no that's that's salt
[2:03:33.980 --> 2:03:39.300]  table salt just to illustrate well you can walk around a crowd and saying I've
[2:03:39.300 --> 2:03:42.780]  got sodium chloride I mean they'll go no please don't put it on me you know with
[2:03:42.780 --> 2:03:48.460]  a bag of it you know that's the attitude well it's the same thing with carbon
[2:03:48.460 --> 2:03:54.300]  dioxide it's gonna kill us oh my god it's that they're releasing it we've got to
[2:03:54.300 --> 2:03:58.500]  put taxes on everyone and not have as many children only have one child because
[2:03:58.500 --> 2:04:05.580]  the carbon dioxide is gonna kill us it's everywhere I mean that's what they're
[2:04:05.580 --> 2:04:12.220]  like then they say well okay carbon dioxide is what plants breathe and then
[2:04:12.220 --> 2:04:16.340]  they produce oxygen and that is part of the life cycle oxygen carbon dioxide and
[2:04:16.340 --> 2:04:23.140]  water that's the life cycle on this planet the three things that are needed
[2:04:23.140 --> 2:04:30.180]  we come back I'm gonna break all this down I mean every radio show I was on a
[2:04:30.180 --> 2:04:33.540]  Canadian show last night and then I was also coast to coast and I was on the
[2:04:33.540 --> 2:04:37.580]  Canadian show and they were running ads in the background about everything's
[2:04:37.580 --> 2:04:41.980]  going green it's not an option you must do it for your survival dropped by our
[2:04:41.980 --> 2:04:49.020]  new green store oh the earth is dying oh my our beloved Republic is on her
[2:04:49.020 --> 2:04:52.460]  knees the forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty
[2:04:52.460 --> 2:04:56.740]  worldwide but in Liberty's darkest hour there is hope the first time in modern
[2:04:56.740 --> 2:05:00.100]  history the people are beginning to wake up it is essential that patriots
[2:05:00.100 --> 2:05:03.700]  worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the new world order
[2:05:03.700 --> 2:05:07.740]  master plan we have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people

[2:05:51.660 --> 2:05:55.220]  body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes
[2:05:55.220 --> 2:05:59.060]  acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat what we drink the
[2:05:59.060 --> 2:06:02.460]  environment and our high stress lifestyles it's these choices that
[2:06:02.460 --> 2:06:06.540]  cause decreased energy weight gain and eventually disease the easiest way to
[2:06:06.540 --> 2:06:10.860]  reduce disease causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water at

[2:07:59.020 --> 2:08:06.540]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas
[2:08:06.540 --> 2:08:10.100]  alex jones
[2:08:10.100 --> 2:08:14.500]  the private corporations that control the governments of the world know they
[2:08:14.500 --> 2:08:19.820]  can't just come to you and say you can only have one child we're gonna say how
[2:08:19.820 --> 2:08:23.860]  big your house is or what job you can have or to put dozens of new taxes on you
[2:08:23.860 --> 2:08:28.700]  unless they have an excuse unless they have a pretext and that's what they do
[2:08:28.700 --> 2:08:33.580]  now they come in and they say the earth is dying everything's falling apart
[2:08:33.580 --> 2:08:38.940]  we've got to do our part only have one child and it should be voluntary but
[2:08:38.940 --> 2:08:42.820]  there should be fines that's double-speak it should be voluntary but
[2:08:42.820 --> 2:08:49.380]  there will be fines in 1975 George Bush senior US ambassador to China he'd run
[2:08:49.380 --> 2:08:53.100]  the eugenics operations here in the US that's public information against the
[2:08:53.100 --> 2:08:58.620]  native americans blacks and others he then went to china and they signed
[2:08:58.620 --> 2:09:03.420]  agreements for i have a world bank loans to follow the imf and world bank
[2:09:03.420 --> 2:09:07.700]  directives of presidential decision directives that tied in the state
[2:09:07.700 --> 2:09:13.580]  department memorandum 200 is all an in game and china became the model test
[2:09:13.580 --> 2:09:19.540]  ground and in 75 they announced the deal was made in 74 started in 75 to be
[2:09:19.540 --> 2:09:26.260]  precise they said it is voluntary but you will be fine they'll be you'll be
[2:09:26.260 --> 2:09:34.020]  fine and there's tax incentives to not have more than one child but you will be
[2:09:34.020 --> 2:09:39.940]  fine if you do and then in 1981 they began coming around and putting people
[2:09:39.940 --> 2:09:44.300]  in prison sterilizing people grabbing babies drowning them in front of the
[2:09:44.300 --> 2:09:49.700]  mothers that's mainstream news that that that goes on our government defends them
[2:09:49.700 --> 2:09:53.580]  has the olympics there never criticizes it you never hear the media criticize
[2:09:53.580 --> 2:09:57.540]  their one-child policy no it's now well china it's controversial but they're
[2:09:57.540 --> 2:10:04.580]  doing what they have to do remember they had a 700 club
[2:10:04.860 --> 2:10:09.820]  pat robertson six years ago coming out and saying well china's doing what it
[2:10:09.820 --> 2:10:13.860]  has to do with forced abortion and infanticide and he said yeah they got to
[2:10:13.860 --> 2:10:20.180]  have stronger Planned Parenthood we need that here then I had people call up and
[2:10:20.180 --> 2:10:23.580]  go how dare you talk about about pat robertson so he said it but we do have
[2:10:23.580 --> 2:10:29.700]  too many people well okay if you think abortion and one child policies are of
[2:10:29.700 --> 2:10:35.020]  the Lord okay I mean you know I love it you'll be for abortion but you don't
[2:10:35.020 --> 2:10:39.500]  hear rock and roll music I mean it's just you people got a major screw loose
[2:10:39.500 --> 2:10:45.460]  major screw loose you miss the big stuff and then obsess on little things so we
[2:10:45.460 --> 2:10:48.540]  had a few stations turn us off they said yeah he said that but we don't want you
[2:10:48.540 --> 2:10:52.420]  talking about about pat robertson I'm sorry I'm not for abortion and it's not
[2:10:52.420 --> 2:11:00.620]  gonna happen especially forced abortion but so you know about all this going on
[2:11:00.620 --> 2:11:05.660]  Ted Turner's always shooting his mouth off by wants to get rid of us so here he
[2:11:05.660 --> 2:11:09.660]  is in the original article in Atlanta Journal Constitution failure to address
[2:11:09.660 --> 2:11:13.300]  global warming will have us all dead or eating each other by mid-century that's
[2:11:13.300 --> 2:11:20.260]  a quote cannibals running around eating each other you heard me right says Ted
[2:11:20.260 --> 2:11:23.620]  Turner the restaurateur environmentalist and former media mogul
[2:11:23.620 --> 2:11:29.140]  his controversial comments have earned him the nickname mouth the sound and he
[2:11:29.140 --> 2:11:32.020]  went on to say one way to come back global warming Turner said is to
[2:11:32.020 --> 2:11:35.860]  stabilize the population there are too many people that's why we have global
[2:11:35.860 --> 2:11:39.220]  warming he said too many people are using too much stuff Turner suggested
[2:11:39.220 --> 2:11:42.740]  that on a voluntary basis everybody in the world's got the pledge to have just
[2:11:42.740 --> 2:11:45.940]  one or two children
[2:11:48.940 --> 2:11:53.500]  and he goes on to say that the earth will raise the temperature by eight
[2:11:53.500 --> 2:11:57.700]  degrees and then it's going to kill us all well actually if carbon dioxide goes
[2:11:57.700 --> 2:12:03.380]  up and we does raise as we had in the last hiberian maximum back 8,000 years
[2:12:03.380 --> 2:12:09.220]  ago start of the Bronze Age that's what made human populations explode but
[2:12:09.220 --> 2:12:14.740]  don't ever confuse Ted Turner with the facts oh yeah they're all dying down at
[2:12:14.740 --> 2:12:17.940]  the equator no that's that's where you have higher birth rates that's where you
[2:12:17.940 --> 2:12:28.900]  have more life the palm trees the coconuts the parents 127 species of
[2:12:28.900 --> 2:12:43.380]  parents in equatorial Africa alone alright I'm digressing Ted Turner's
[2:12:43.380 --> 2:12:47.740]  depopulation plan way too many people that's why we have global warming so
[2:12:47.740 --> 2:12:51.460]  see global warming is an excuse to teach us humans are bad humans are the
[2:12:51.460 --> 2:12:55.780]  problem and don't worry other humans are gonna have to deal with that problem
[2:12:55.780 --> 2:13:00.060]  and human life is bad and so once you have the attitude that human life is
[2:13:00.060 --> 2:13:03.340]  bad once you have the attitude that humans are something that are evil and
[2:13:03.340 --> 2:13:06.820]  need to be dealt with then you can kill people you can slaughter people you can
[2:13:06.820 --> 2:13:15.380]  sterilize people and it's the moral rationalization for all of this in fact
[2:13:15.380 --> 2:13:21.220]  check president Claus in March of last year said all of us are very much in
[2:13:21.220 --> 2:13:25.340]  favor of maximum environmental protection protection of nature he said
[2:13:25.340 --> 2:13:28.180]  an interview with the Kato Institute but it has nothing in common with
[2:13:28.180 --> 2:13:31.780]  environmentalism which is talking about global warming movement which is
[2:13:31.780 --> 2:13:36.900]  ideological and practically attacking our freedom environmentalism he said in
[2:13:36.900 --> 2:13:41.140]  the modern sense a way of introducing new forms of statism new forms of
[2:13:41.140 --> 2:13:48.460]  masterminded human society from above you can watch the full interview under
[2:13:48.460 --> 2:13:52.340]  that by clicking on Charlie Rose the link this is out of a live site news
[2:13:52.340 --> 2:14:01.660]  Turner's depopulation plan so he's got this road warrior future of everybody
[2:14:01.660 --> 2:14:06.220]  dying in mass if we don't quote stop global warming no and this is a key I
[2:14:06.220 --> 2:14:09.020]  haven't stressed enough I don't think I've even said this more than once or
[2:14:09.020 --> 2:14:15.020]  twice listen carefully they do have weather manipulation systems both from
[2:14:15.020 --> 2:14:19.860]  aerial spraying and magnetic antenna arrays that's declassified that's
[2:14:19.860 --> 2:14:24.460]  admitted understand that's key they can control hurricanes they can steer them
[2:14:24.460 --> 2:14:28.260]  they can create them they can kill them they can make them stronger they can do
[2:14:28.260 --> 2:14:32.900]  a lot they can change the direction or the not the direction they can
[2:14:32.900 --> 2:14:37.700]  admittedly change where a jet stream is moving it they can lower it down they
[2:14:37.700 --> 2:14:45.220]  can move it up higher that's all admitted and the way they're hyping this I
[2:14:45.220 --> 2:14:47.620]  believe you're gonna see more and more disasters and I believe they're
[2:14:47.620 --> 2:14:51.780]  engineering a lot of it it's the perfect form of government-sponsored elite
[2:14:51.780 --> 2:14:55.700]  sponsored terror because they don't have to blame it on al-qaeda al-ciyat of
[2:14:55.700 --> 2:15:02.940]  patsy's they just and of course Secretary of Defense Cohen in 1997 said
[2:15:02.940 --> 2:15:05.860]  that there are weather weapons governments have developed and that they
[2:15:05.860 --> 2:15:09.540]  could already create earthquakes now I haven't seen the declassification of
[2:15:09.540 --> 2:15:12.980]  that I have seen the declassification of weather weapons I mean they could
[2:15:12.980 --> 2:15:17.660]  control hurricanes documented in 1968 Stanford Research Institute Naval War
[2:15:17.660 --> 2:15:21.100]  for Laboratory certified it we had the father of weather weapons the meteorologist
[2:15:21.100 --> 2:15:27.500]  on here several times Ben Livingston so they're running around telling you
[2:15:27.500 --> 2:15:29.940]  there's gonna be mass death of destruction and I agree there's probably
[2:15:29.940 --> 2:15:34.740]  gonna be that because they're engineering it notice they're saying as the
[2:15:34.740 --> 2:15:41.300]  temperature goes up super Ebola will get out and will kill 90% of you and they
[2:15:41.300 --> 2:15:46.060]  chortle as they work in the bio biology departments in level four bio weapons
[2:15:46.060 --> 2:15:53.540]  labs at level two security you seen 13 monkeys better go see it with a nut
[2:15:53.540 --> 2:15:58.460]  scientist assistant releases them super bio weapon and kills 99.9% of the
[2:15:58.460 --> 2:16:03.780]  people these folks credit Hitler Stalin and Mao they carried out eugenics
[2:16:03.780 --> 2:16:07.340]  worldwide they got the money they got the power do you think Bill Gates gave 40
[2:16:07.340 --> 2:16:11.020]  billion with his wife and that Warren Buffett gave more than 43 billion
[2:16:11.020 --> 2:16:15.980]  because they want to be sweet to black African children while the Gates family
[2:16:15.980 --> 2:16:22.180]  runs the Planned Parenthood you go look at what that's used for it's used in
[2:16:22.180 --> 2:16:27.700]  sterilization it's used in hardcore quote family planning it's used in
[2:16:27.700 --> 2:16:35.460]  special inoculation programs in Thailand where it kills the babies oh yeah
[2:16:35.460 --> 2:16:39.060]  they make the women in Thailand take three shots of tetanus the government
[2:16:39.060 --> 2:16:42.620]  comes and makes them says it's the law there is no law there's films online we
[2:16:42.620 --> 2:16:51.300]  posted them newscast and such and number one tetanus is only given once every
[2:16:51.300 --> 2:16:55.740]  seven to nine years why in Thailand are they forcing three shots and they and
[2:16:55.740 --> 2:17:00.860]  it's the women in the village lined up the baby was dancing in my tummy happy
[2:17:00.860 --> 2:17:06.900]  eight months old he come they give me first shot baby stop dancing start
[2:17:06.900 --> 2:17:12.940]  shaking next week next shot baby not die yet so they give me third baby die baby
[2:17:12.940 --> 2:17:18.340]  come out big baby beautiful they kill baby see sometimes the babies fight back
[2:17:18.340 --> 2:17:22.500]  and they oh doctor drops by for the shop the next day she normally wouldn't do
[2:17:22.500 --> 2:17:26.620]  with a tetanus shot but they're they're dropping by to see how you're doing oh
[2:17:26.620 --> 2:17:34.020]  baby you hadn't your miscarriage yet here you go take your fluoride pills do
[2:17:34.020 --> 2:17:40.140]  you understand the nightmare psychopathic eugenics I don't want to call
[2:17:40.140 --> 2:17:43.420]  them Nazis because the Nazis learned from these people it was the England in
[2:17:43.420 --> 2:17:49.020]  US run everything they're poisoning your water poisoning your air putting your
[2:17:49.020 --> 2:17:53.140]  kids on super high-powered fluoride known to cause massive brain damage not
[2:17:53.140 --> 2:17:57.500]  just the water or toothpaste but pills and washes forced at school on top of
[2:17:57.500 --> 2:18:01.460]  it they're hitting as hard from every angle Ted Turner's running around
[2:18:01.460 --> 2:18:06.060]  saying he wants 95% of us dead dr. Pionka the example I use is it's well
[2:18:06.060 --> 2:18:10.620]  documented and Texas Academy of Sciences wins the big award 95% standing
[2:18:10.620 --> 2:18:14.660]  ovation repeatedly when he talks about how he can't wait till 90% of us are
[2:18:14.660 --> 2:18:19.100]  dead and how humanity is a virus and a cancer and they were just yes kill as oh
[2:18:19.100 --> 2:18:29.020]  yeah oh yeah oh but here's the larger issue we got six billion four hundred
[2:18:29.020 --> 2:18:32.220]  million people it's gonna plane out and every computer model and every
[2:18:32.220 --> 2:18:35.300]  population study which has been proven to be accurate at about eight and a half
[2:18:35.300 --> 2:18:41.580]  billion people in 2020 now only 12 years from now once a country becomes
[2:18:41.580 --> 2:18:45.340]  industrialized they have negative population growth two parents have on
[2:18:45.340 --> 2:18:49.820]  average 1.5 children they don't even replace themselves
[2:18:49.820 --> 2:18:56.860]  Japan's what 1.2 Italy's 1.4 Germany's 1.3 the US is 2.2 but that's because we
[2:18:56.860 --> 2:19:03.500]  have a huge immigrant influx or is it 2.3 we're dying and you read the royal
[2:19:03.500 --> 2:19:10.820]  population plan the Royal Commission of population 44 to 49 the British say well
[2:19:10.820 --> 2:19:15.420]  we want eugenics but that would make them have had be industrialized they're
[2:19:15.420 --> 2:19:18.860]  gonna lower their population but we'll go ahead and not let them industrialize
[2:19:18.860 --> 2:19:24.780]  it'll cause a big balloon but then we'll just use soft kill approaches on them
[2:19:24.780 --> 2:19:29.300]  basically is what they say that is making sure the world third world had a
[2:19:29.300 --> 2:19:34.020]  big population to tie them down so the globalist this is nothing to do with
[2:19:34.020 --> 2:19:38.300]  saving the earth it's with hurting people and holding civilization back and
[2:19:38.300 --> 2:19:44.420]  brain-damaging you so you can't compete with them scientifically done

[2:24:40.340 --> 2:24:47.060]  on Monday what that is okay let's go to Scott in Arizona Scott go ahead hey
[2:24:47.060 --> 2:24:51.460]  Alex hey my question is about a lot of news articles I've been seeing here
[2:24:51.460 --> 2:24:58.420]  lately about the Iran war deal going on in that bush I guess warned Russia not
[2:24:58.420 --> 2:25:02.900]  to stay neutral that he could attack some facilities inside Iran with the
[2:25:02.900 --> 2:25:07.580]  nuclear bombs and I guess Saudi Arabia is doing drills right now for nuclear
[2:25:07.580 --> 2:25:12.220]  assault and at that same time Israel supposed to attack Syria I mean they're
[2:25:12.220 --> 2:25:16.660]  there they're doing all those things and they've got aircraft carriers lined up
[2:25:16.660 --> 2:25:21.780]  and if they do that I would suspect Bush would stage some terror attack here
[2:25:21.780 --> 2:25:26.740]  first as a pretext but yeah they're mad men and they know their whole agenda
[2:25:26.740 --> 2:25:30.820]  their whole world government agenda stalling so they need to really escalate
[2:25:30.820 --> 2:25:35.380]  it up to the next level to terrorize everybody into going along with it and
[2:25:35.380 --> 2:25:39.900]  they said this is gonna happen in April so they said it's gonna happen on the
[2:25:39.900 --> 2:25:44.580]  fifth through the seventh but again the Russians just do this stuff all the time
[2:25:44.580 --> 2:25:49.500]  though this time it there are some troubling signs I just you know we
[2:25:49.500 --> 2:25:53.300]  hear all the time we've been hearing for three years are gonna attack Iran yeah
[2:25:53.300 --> 2:25:57.580]  but they got the right outside they're ready to launch and they got all the
[2:25:57.580 --> 2:26:00.940]  drills that are well I'll tell you why I think they may do it and I'm not saying
[2:26:00.940 --> 2:26:03.820]  they're gonna do it but I'll tell you why I think they may the White House has
[2:26:03.820 --> 2:26:07.840]  been saying they may do it and that's off the table and they basically fired
[2:26:07.840 --> 2:26:12.500]  Fox Fallon the head of the operations over there because he wouldn't do it go
[2:26:12.500 --> 2:26:17.420]  ahead yeah exactly so they got somebody that will do it now and it's pretty
[2:26:17.420 --> 2:26:20.700]  scary I think that we might see something in here in April that's right
[2:26:20.700 --> 2:26:26.060]  the Israelis can't even take on Lebanon the US and their puppet Iraqi
[2:26:26.060 --> 2:26:30.500]  government can't even take on a few thousand she eyes but oh let's go nuke
[2:26:30.500 --> 2:26:36.580]  with with precision nukes let's go nuke they're saying oh we're allowed to nuke
[2:26:36.580 --> 2:26:41.060]  people first they're peaceful reactors that have all been inspected yeah and
[2:26:41.060 --> 2:26:44.720]  with also George Putch the other thing is that he warned Russia that will
[2:26:44.720 --> 2:26:49.780]  collapse your economy with our reserve currency if you get involved in it now
[2:26:49.780 --> 2:26:54.540]  we're in an article to where did you see that it was on one of the articles that
[2:26:54.540 --> 2:26:58.460]  actually I beat it from the wrong part of my first I was on a rock ball fight
[2:26:58.460 --> 2:27:01.900]  which then led me to the article and I read and there's like a couple different
[2:27:01.900 --> 2:27:04.260]  articles that are stating that same well I've seen that there's a lot of
[2:27:04.260 --> 2:27:08.420]  speculation going on I appreciate your call I mean there's a Russian rumor and
[2:27:08.420 --> 2:27:12.060]  Lou Rockwell talks about it and all this stuff the Fox Fallon thing is scary
[2:27:12.060 --> 2:27:16.940]  let's just pray it doesn't happen but they'll fly planes into buildings and
[2:27:16.940 --> 2:27:20.460]  blame it on imaginary men and caves I mean there's there's nothing they won't
[2:27:20.460 --> 2:27:26.220]  do God help us just God help us Jason in New York you're on the air yeah the
[2:27:26.220 --> 2:27:30.900]  going man good um are you aware that a 15 high-ranking Bush administration
[2:27:30.900 --> 2:27:36.620]  officials were subpoenaed in the APAC espionage trial yes I was aware of that
[2:27:36.620 --> 2:27:40.540]  well the reason why I mean I mean basically the Bush administration is
[2:27:40.540 --> 2:27:45.580]  either old good old boys from the banking system and oil companies or their
[2:27:45.580 --> 2:27:51.460]  public dual agents of Israel I mean just publicly Mukaisi chertoff it's it's
[2:27:51.460 --> 2:27:56.740]  unbelievable we might as well just move the Knesset to Washington okay well
[2:27:56.740 --> 2:28:00.660]  some some of the high-profile officials who are actually subpoenaed in that case
[2:28:00.660 --> 2:28:06.180]  so connoisseur Rice Steven Halley Richard Armitage Paul Wolfwoods and Douglas
[2:28:06.180 --> 2:28:10.460]  Fife you know there's 10 others but those are high-profile officials who are
[2:28:10.460 --> 2:28:14.660]  subpoenaed in that case that's a huge scandal I mean that I think the media
[2:28:14.660 --> 2:28:18.820]  should be a report in that like every every day especially the alternative
[2:28:18.820 --> 2:28:22.260]  media like yourself like that's a huge scandal China they try to suppress that
[2:28:22.260 --> 2:28:27.420]  story man that's a big scandal man I don't think anything's being suppressed
[2:28:27.420 --> 2:28:33.140]  they just had another poll out today where 90 plus percent of the world in
[2:28:33.140 --> 2:28:38.420]  polls believes the US and Israel are the most dangerous threat to world peace but

[2:38:25.180 --> 2:38:31.780]  section on here where they have posted the different amounts that are in
[2:38:31.780 --> 2:38:36.340]  fluoride toothpaste I'm gonna have to you know what I think I'll do a show on

[2:38:44.140 --> 2:38:49.380]  subject last week we brought you Jim Mars about the Bobby assassination and we
[2:38:49.380 --> 2:38:54.780]  brought you the Japanese parliamentarian about 911 being an inside job but I'm
[2:38:54.780 --> 2:38:58.180]  in here looking at all of it so I'll talk more about that Sunday but post all
[2:38:58.180 --> 2:39:02.700]  your fluoride percentage findings on there how much of this stuff's really in
[2:39:02.700 --> 2:39:05.940]  the fluoride washes they make the kids take and the rest of it in the
[2:39:05.940 --> 2:39:10.620]  government death camps and I want to be clear the teachers don't know they're
[2:39:10.620 --> 2:39:13.460]  compartmentalized like everybody else that's how this stuff works Mike and
[2:39:13.460 --> 2:39:18.940]  Louisiana go ahead long-time listener real quick on the dovetailing with your
[2:39:18.940 --> 2:39:23.620]  economic news you mentioned before an interesting graph that that's good to
[2:39:23.620 --> 2:39:27.460]  look up and you can type it in real quick and find it it's a mortgage equity
[2:39:27.460 --> 2:39:31.940]  withdrawals when you're talking about a they look at GDP as reported each year
[2:39:31.940 --> 2:39:35.500]  and they go each year and they and the government gives us our GDP report shows
[2:39:35.500 --> 2:39:38.860]  how our economy is growing you know one two three four percent whatever if you
[2:39:38.860 --> 2:39:43.580]  take out what people are taking out of their houses in equity you actually see
[2:39:43.580 --> 2:39:48.660]  the real story and there's a chart you type in MEW it's it's mortgage equity
[2:39:48.660 --> 2:39:53.100]  withdrawal it gives a truer picture of our real GDP when you know not this
[2:39:53.100 --> 2:39:58.260]  trumped-up super appreciated house value and let's just live off of our quote
[2:39:58.260 --> 2:40:03.300]  unquote equity and and so now that you if you take that into account you see
[2:40:03.300 --> 2:40:06.660]  that you know in the last couple years there's been a huge divide in those two
[2:40:06.660 --> 2:40:10.100]  numbers and that where you've got negative GDP growth without the mortgage
[2:40:10.100 --> 2:40:14.620]  equity withdrawal the government gets to report a positive GDP growth and it's
[2:40:14.620 --> 2:40:18.740]  really amazing so with you with tighter mortgage guidelines and people not getting
[2:40:18.740 --> 2:40:23.460]  as many loans I can't wait to see oh seven and oh eight and on into the
[2:40:23.460 --> 2:40:28.020]  future what the true picture is gonna look like with and without the GDP
[2:40:28.020 --> 2:40:31.700]  withdrawal I mean sorry that mortgage equity withdrawal as it relates to GDP
[2:40:31.700 --> 2:40:36.460]  that's really amazing well there's all sorts of manipulations they engage into
[2:40:36.460 --> 2:40:39.780]  the point of where the shadow stats experts and others have said it's it's
[2:40:39.780 --> 2:40:43.980]  not even there's no resemblance to reality absolutely and this is what the
[2:40:43.980 --> 2:40:48.300]  cookbooks so you can imagine what it really is so that's that's amazing one
[2:40:48.300 --> 2:40:51.460]  thing I just want to mention is as a fellow Christian you know God says
[2:40:51.460 --> 2:40:55.740]  Proverbs 227 the rich rule of poor and the borrower servant to the lender we
[2:40:55.740 --> 2:40:58.820]  know the rich rule of poor our fight is making sure that they play by the right
[2:40:58.820 --> 2:41:02.460]  rules and our founding fathers tried to do that recognizing that the men of
[2:41:02.460 --> 2:41:06.060]  aspiration are going to try to seek those elements those elevations to power
[2:41:06.060 --> 2:41:10.780]  and it's really can we constrain them so keep up the good fight and you're
[2:41:10.780 --> 2:41:13.940]  doing a great job thank you yeah everything this criminal government's
[2:41:13.940 --> 2:41:18.380]  doing this illegitimate government's doing is 180 degrees opposite from what
[2:41:18.380 --> 2:41:23.300]  the founders said and the laws say and just because you got the guns doesn't
[2:41:23.300 --> 2:41:27.420]  mean it's all right I mean this government this is not a free country to a
[2:41:27.420 --> 2:41:31.060]  great extent this is not what America was founded on land of the free home of
[2:41:31.060 --> 2:41:35.220]  the brave give me a break surveilled controlled lied to let's turn it around
[2:41:35.220 --> 2:41:42.300]  together only one tenth of 1% stand again from this 99% of us I don't care
[2:41:42.300 --> 2:41:44.940]  if you work for the government or what we're all in trouble we're all together
[2:41:44.940 --> 2:41:56.460]  on this Eric in California go ahead good morning Alex hi my comment is on the
[2:41:56.460 --> 2:42:04.020]  Darrell Issa article and that's right Darrell Issa the federal government
[2:42:04.020 --> 2:42:07.540]  they've spent trillions of dollars in the wars and everything from the attacks
[2:42:07.540 --> 2:42:12.980]  and one case 16 million dollar for a blue tarp that Halliburton put up that
[2:42:12.980 --> 2:42:16.900]  that's top of scams calling it a permanent structure but they're blocking
[2:42:16.900 --> 2:42:22.700]  healthcare from the firefighters and police and others and go ahead yeah
[2:42:22.700 --> 2:42:27.060]  this this story has me just absolutely livid because he represents my district
[2:42:27.060 --> 2:42:32.300]  and I will make it my personal mission to make sure that he does not get
[2:42:32.300 --> 2:42:38.740]  reelected this year he's up for re-election this year and it's got me
[2:42:38.740 --> 2:42:45.020]  so angry because what do all the people who oppose 9-11 truth say you know they
[2:42:45.020 --> 2:42:50.220]  say well questioning the official story is disrespecting the first responders
[2:42:50.220 --> 2:42:57.220]  and those who died on that day well could you not have a more blatant example of
[2:42:57.220 --> 2:43:02.060]  disrespecting the victims of 9-11 by not giving them proper
[2:43:02.060 --> 2:43:07.580]  healthcare after they went there and cleaned up that that toxic site and
[2:43:07.580 --> 2:43:11.660]  then the government covered up day one they knew it was deadly asbestos and
[2:43:11.660 --> 2:43:16.540]  aerosolized concrete and glass and lead mercury from all the mercury switches
[2:43:16.540 --> 2:43:20.700]  and the computers and thermostats and the rest of it they covered it up
[2:43:20.700 --> 2:43:24.940]  knowingly that's now been admitted those documents have come out it's
[2:43:24.940 --> 2:43:29.060]  political though if they admit there even though all the major hospitals and
[2:43:29.060 --> 2:43:35.580]  Mount Sinai there some of their lungs have full multi ounces of this stuff per
[2:43:35.580 --> 2:43:41.420]  lung and even in the different lobes masses of them dying and they block it
[2:43:41.420 --> 2:43:46.540]  and but then they use them and pimp them out to launch wars and make Bush look
[2:43:46.540 --> 2:43:51.340]  like a hero but they can't give them medical care for the cancer and the
[2:43:51.340 --> 2:43:56.140]  toxic exposure because then the government is on the hook for covering it
[2:43:56.140 --> 2:44:00.420]  up and it's a tacit admission of that so they're liable so they're just saying
[2:44:00.420 --> 2:44:04.260]  shut up firemen shut up police crawling your hole and die thanks for the call
[2:44:04.260 --> 2:44:08.980]  and we've got the video clip of him it's up on jonesreport.com he just says you

[2:44:26.980 --> 2:44:31.560]  they think you're scum they use you it's a big sick joke I know I got loaded
[2:44:31.560 --> 2:44:36.740]  phone lines but I may have time to take a couple more I probably will not because

[2:48:01.980 --> 2:48:06.580]  skeptical about the official version of events on 9-11 and wishes he would have
[2:48:06.580 --> 2:48:10.060]  said so sooner Ventura was Minnesota's governor when the planes hit the twin
[2:48:10.060 --> 2:48:14.460]  towers he now says he regrets not asking more questions about the attacks back
[2:48:14.460 --> 2:48:18.460]  then when his words carried more weight Ventura spoke yesterday with a radio
[2:48:18.460 --> 2:48:24.500]  host who believes the u.s. government was behind the attacks jet fuel is for
[2:48:24.500 --> 2:48:30.340]  bits kerosene which is not a hot burning fuel and they want us to believe
[2:48:30.340 --> 2:48:35.100]  that it melted these steel structured gurgers and caused these buildings to
[2:48:35.100 --> 2:48:39.860]  pancake collapse to the ground I was on the site within two weeks after it
[2:48:39.860 --> 2:48:44.100]  happened and I saw none of these pancakes Ventura also said the way the
[2:48:44.100 --> 2:48:48.380]  buildings fell appeared to him exactly like the control demolition of a Las
[2:48:48.380 --> 2:48:52.460]  Vegas hotel there's a whole bunch of these from Texas to New York to
[2:48:52.460 --> 2:48:57.340]  Minnesota to California of Jesse Ventura it's hit international television as

[2:50:08.220 --> 2:50:11.700]  recognize the people know they stage the attacks now they recognize it didn't
[2:50:11.700 --> 2:50:15.900]  like Kennedy where it took 30 years to expose they did it now the majority know
[2:50:15.900 --> 2:50:21.380]  and now the police are finding out false flag terror has been introduced in the

[2:54:39.060 --> 2:54:44.020]  really had the Southwest they couldn't take it away from the natives and then
[2:54:44.020 --> 2:54:47.940]  now the corrupt government down there teaches their people for 50 years it
[2:54:47.940 --> 2:54:52.540]  belongs to them and I'm tired of post offices government buildings taking the
[2:54:52.540 --> 2:54:56.460]  American flag down the illegals will tear down American flags Burnham run up
[2:54:56.460 --> 2:55:01.500]  Mexican flags but now in Mexican Independence days the globalist run
[2:55:01.500 --> 2:55:06.300]  universities run up Mexican flags and take down American and that's what
[2:55:06.300 --> 2:55:11.540]  happened here so this student Air Force vet took it down well they came and
[2:55:11.540 --> 2:55:16.380]  arrested him and then he went to trial and oh they're so nice he only gets six
[2:55:16.380 --> 2:55:22.260]  months probation and 40 something hours community service what about the issue is
[2:55:22.260 --> 2:55:33.540]  the school flying the Mexican flag with no American flag I'm tired of it I mean
[2:55:33.540 --> 2:55:36.660]  we're not gonna I'm not gonna play along with it anymore like the Mexican radio
[2:55:36.660 --> 2:55:40.060]  isn't going we're taking over we're gonna get you green goes ha ha ha listen I
[2:55:40.060 --> 2:55:46.020]  hear that I'm sick of it I don't dislike you you think we're all ignorant
[2:55:46.020 --> 2:55:49.260]  like Ventura who thinks you know I guess you didn't speak Spanish you didn't
[2:55:49.260 --> 2:55:52.820]  hear what you're saying behind his back it isn't funny it didn't cute knock it
[2:55:52.820 --> 2:55:57.380]  off here it is it is a case that has divided a community
[2:55:57.380 --> 2:56:02.260]  sidesplit over whether an Air Force veteran who took down and tore apart a
[2:56:02.260 --> 2:56:07.780]  Mexican flag acted out of patriotism or hatred a jury spent two days hearing the
[2:56:07.780 --> 2:56:13.980]  case of that man Peter Lynch Shelton Dawson is live at district court
[2:56:13.980 --> 2:56:17.580]  when it boils right down to it this is just a misdemeanor case of criminal
[2:56:17.580 --> 2:56:22.420]  damage to property but then you factor in the racial overtones and in all
[2:56:22.420 --> 2:56:27.060]  likelihood this is a case that will be remembered a lot longer than in see
[2:56:27.060 --> 2:56:31.980]  racial overtones if you don't like a foreign country that attacked the US
[2:56:31.980 --> 2:56:35.860]  during World War one in huge racial murders all over the Southwest in one
[2:56:35.860 --> 2:56:41.220]  day plan a San Diego if you don't like their racism you're a racist see it's
[2:56:41.220 --> 2:56:44.340]  meant to suppress ladies and gentlemen well we're not buying into it here it
[2:56:44.340 --> 2:56:50.260]  is any sentence that Peter Lynch could have received when Peter Lynch tore
[2:56:50.260 --> 2:56:55.100]  apart a Mexican flag that had been flying improperly on the UNM campus he
[2:56:55.100 --> 2:56:59.540]  touched off a firestorm of emotions the reading of the verdict against him this
[2:56:59.540 --> 2:57:05.060]  afternoon was much more subdued we find the defendant guilty of criminal damage
[2:57:05.060 --> 2:57:09.380]  to property during the course of the two-day trial Lynch's attorney argued
[2:57:09.380 --> 2:57:14.260]  the US Air Force veteran was only defending federal law by removing the
[2:57:14.260 --> 2:57:18.740]  Mexican flag which should have been accompanied by an American flag a point
[2:57:18.740 --> 2:57:22.940]  Lynch reiterated in a brief post-sentencing interview I was a
[2:57:22.940 --> 2:57:26.100]  cub scout you know I learned when I was seven years old how to raise a
[2:57:26.100 --> 2:57:30.460]  lower flag and fold it if a seven-year-old can learn it you know I think
[2:57:30.460 --> 2:57:35.980]  it's kind of embedded into our society as Americans and I just I feel
[2:57:35.980 --> 2:57:39.700]  strongly about the the colors of the United States of America and that's
[2:57:39.700 --> 2:57:44.220]  that's what that's what it's all about Lynch faced a maximum of six months in
[2:57:44.220 --> 2:57:50.380]  jail and a $500 fine but instead Metro Court judge Clyde de Merceman gave him
[2:57:50.380 --> 2:57:55.380]  a six month deferred sentence placed him on probation and ordered him to replace
[2:57:55.380 --> 2:57:59.340]  the flag and complete 40 okay let's stop right there I'll cover this more on
[2:57:59.340 --> 2:58:03.260]  Sunday in the fluoride and we back on money with a big announcement bottom
[2:58:03.260 --> 2:58:07.700]  line you see it's now treason to defend your country let's admit it
