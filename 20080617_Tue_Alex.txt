[00:00.000 --> 00:07.360]  government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the
[00:07.360 --> 00:14.400]  GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:14.400 --> 00:20.000]  welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome I am not Alex Jones I am Jason Bermas and
[00:20.000 --> 00:25.760]  I'm gonna be sitting in for the rest of the week big news obviously we're gonna
[00:25.760 --> 00:28.600]  be playing the marked ice flip over at Raiden we're gonna play the first one
[00:28.600 --> 00:32.960]  as well we're gonna have mark on in about 15 minutes but if you listen to the
[00:32.960 --> 00:39.360]  show yesterday I was talking about this prison attack out in Afghanistan and I
[00:39.360 --> 00:44.200]  said to everybody now look on Friday they show you that a thousand militants
[00:44.200 --> 00:51.400]  have escaped from this prison and I said on Monday they report that the Taliban
[00:51.400 --> 00:56.600]  has a stronghold again in Afghanistan literally took them a weekend I guess
[00:56.600 --> 01:01.400]  to get much more of a stronghold than they had again this is less than a
[01:01.400 --> 01:04.320]  thousand people I mean let's think about it the thousand prisoners they still
[01:04.320 --> 01:09.840]  only admitted about 400 Taliban the numbers are ridiculous our military is
[01:09.840 --> 01:14.720]  much greater and stronger so I get off the air and I believe there is a story
[01:14.720 --> 01:18.840]  over at info wars calm and prison planet calm in fact I'm gonna bring that
[01:18.840 --> 01:24.080]  story right up it's just incredible folks they're now admitting admitting that
[01:24.080 --> 01:28.120]  the US gave the green light for the attack they probably did more than just
[01:28.120 --> 01:36.240]  let it happen let's be honest let's be honest I mean it's it's just let's
[01:36.240 --> 01:40.280]  let's explain it again if they were a real threat they would be in
[01:40.280 --> 01:45.280]  places like Guantanamo Bay which are totally horrific and torture people and
[01:45.280 --> 01:50.720]  small children and women and rape them and those pictures are out there I'm
[01:50.720 --> 01:57.320]  sorry you know it disturbs me a lot that all of this can be public okay
[01:57.320 --> 02:02.960]  senators can literally come out of of the Capitol building and say to the
[02:02.960 --> 02:08.480]  media what I saw was horrific I'm embarrassed I'm appalled I'm shocked and
[02:08.480 --> 02:15.080]  this is the stuff we weren't allowed to see now what we did see what we did see
[02:15.080 --> 02:20.840]  was just unbelievable I mean and into it it didn't even scratch the surface guys
[02:20.840 --> 02:30.800]  it didn't even scratch the surface so again let me recap it Friday prison
[02:30.800 --> 02:39.920]  attack Taliban goes free Monday Taliban stronghold in Afghanistan again later
[02:39.920 --> 02:44.760]  Monday afternoon the US allowed it to happen they gave the green light let me
[02:44.760 --> 02:52.280]  say it again they gave the green light it's unbelievable it's just unbelievable
[02:52.280 --> 02:57.000]  folks how many more times are who's gonna bring this up everybody should be
[02:57.000 --> 03:01.120]  calling their local representatives and just go nuts about this our troops are
[03:01.120 --> 03:06.600]  gonna be there forever if what we do is capture people and then allow them to go
[03:06.600 --> 03:12.400]  free and then act like there's a conflict okay 400 more Taliban members
[03:12.400 --> 03:17.920]  come on think about our military power think about what you've seen just
[03:17.920 --> 03:25.640]  publicly what you've seen it's it's it's it's beyond the pale it's beyond the
[03:25.640 --> 03:31.400]  pale and then we have the neocons that propagate this war they're the big cheer

[03:34.880 --> 03:39.240]  everybody apparently like Michael Reagan I watched a really disgusting clip
[03:39.240 --> 03:44.000]  where he said I guess these parents named their kid Hezbollah okay which is
[03:44.000 --> 03:49.080]  tasteless but whatever I you know the kid didn't name himself Hezbollah okay
[03:49.080 --> 03:53.160]  it's not the kids fault and even then it doesn't deserve death he said oh well
[03:53.160 --> 03:56.320]  we should just take a grenade and shove it right up its bottom and blow it up
[03:56.320 --> 03:59.400]  blow it up babies that's what that's what Michael Reagan's about when he's
[03:59.400 --> 04:06.000]  not threatening 9-11 truthers when he's not soliciting their murders oh man

[14:53.640 --> 14:58.360]  get to the apology there but he just keeps wanting names and you're explaining
[14:58.360 --> 15:01.560]  to him you know take a look at the project for a new American Century
[15:01.560 --> 15:08.080]  list Paul Wolfowitz Dan quail Jeb Bush Dick Cheney Donald Rumsfeld I could go
[15:08.080 --> 15:15.040]  on mark how are you I'm doing good but I'm still a little disturbed the the
[15:15.040 --> 15:18.720]  spokesperson over there Radio America they both the affiliate director and the
[15:18.720 --> 15:22.680]  communications director told me that no disciplinary action will be taken
[15:22.680 --> 15:27.040]  against Reagan they said that he has apologized and that they think that
[15:27.040 --> 15:30.920]  everything is okay and I asked him if the president of radio America was
[15:30.920 --> 15:35.120]  familiar with the controversy that was going on and he declined to say so I
[15:35.120 --> 15:38.840]  I'm under the suspicion that they're just trying to protect Reagan that the
[15:38.840 --> 15:43.800]  the president as of yesterday was not aware of this though I posted his direct
[15:43.800 --> 15:47.560]  a line in his extension of the email address and I see the prison planner
[15:47.560 --> 15:51.480]  dot com has something up there too and you know this is appalling also that no
[15:51.480 --> 15:55.360]  mainstream media has covered this raw story I don't know if raw stories
[15:55.360 --> 15:58.960]  considered mainstream media but I mean we're talking this should be in in the
[15:58.960 --> 16:03.600]  several major newspapers and several major television stations and and this
[16:03.600 --> 16:07.240]  is an unprecedented event that has happened and it's still a blackout and
[16:07.240 --> 16:11.960]  I think we just need to continue to push and push and send a message and said
[16:11.960 --> 16:15.240]  the precedent that this kind of behavior is not going to be tolerated and that
[16:15.240 --> 16:19.200]  there's going to be consequences there's going to be legal consequences your

[17:18.160 --> 17:22.000]  Roberts is the name of the president of radio America you can go to radio
[17:22.000 --> 17:26.200]  America dot org there's a phone number down at the very bottom of the page his

[18:01.520 --> 18:07.440]  dot org and just please continue to follow reports with the FCC the must
[18:07.440 --> 18:11.520]  include the date that when they say the call letters I just put radio America
[18:11.520 --> 18:17.440]  comma syndicator for the date you have to enter June 10th the form is very
[18:17.440 --> 18:20.520]  picked very picky on there took me several entries before it would finally
[18:20.520 --> 18:24.560]  accept it and that we just got to get the ball rolling over there and I mean
[18:24.560 --> 18:27.960]  just the fact that his studio you know it is there's there's in a studio we we
[18:27.960 --> 18:31.480]  get these this impression that there's a large huge corporation that runs these
[18:31.480 --> 18:34.880]  things but a lot of time it's the producer it's some technicians and I
[18:34.880 --> 18:37.680]  have a feeling that they're just kind of keeping this to themselves they don't
[18:37.680 --> 18:41.160]  want the higher-ups within radio America to be aware of this so we're going
[18:41.160 --> 18:44.680]  straight to Jim Roberts the president and the more we get this out in the
[18:44.680 --> 18:48.920]  mainstream media and the more and the more people it's going to become getting
[18:48.920 --> 18:53.160]  aware of this the more heated it's going to bring to have him fired and in that
[18:53.160 --> 18:56.200]  interview with me yesterday he made a couple radical claims that are just
[18:56.200 --> 19:00.600]  blatantly false saying that radio America or that air America hosts rather
[19:00.600 --> 19:05.080]  have called for the death of George Bush just blatantly false the Secret
[19:05.080 --> 19:08.880]  Service would be investigating that they would be arrested and they would be
[19:08.880 --> 19:13.120]  they would be fired immediately and it's interesting he doesn't think that the
[19:13.120 --> 19:18.320]  Bilderberg group is important that's that's old news yeah all the policy
[19:18.320 --> 19:21.840]  they just discussed still hasn't been implemented and as I've discussed before
[19:21.840 --> 19:26.480]  you know that's the weekend where we have you know 140 people this summer
[19:26.480 --> 19:29.920]  we're gonna have 3,000 people where they'll disperse their little agendas
[19:29.920 --> 19:33.240]  throughout in a compartmentalized fashion we've got Mark Dice with us it's the

[20:00.480 --> 20:04.360]  record prices at the pump I have run across a company called SFR who has
[20:04.360 --> 20:08.560]  developed two products that improve gas mileage instead of paying a mechanic as
[20:08.560 --> 20:12.720]  much as $300 to clean your injection system protect a complete fuel system
[20:12.720 --> 20:17.640]  treatment cleans to 95% of new engine condition improving mileage and only
[20:17.640 --> 20:21.480]  one tank full protect an engine treatment not only reduces friction but it
[20:21.480 --> 20:25.520]  extends the life of your engine let's face it with the high price of gasoline
[20:25.520 --> 20:29.240]  it's time to take action purchase a protective fuel system treatment for
[20:29.240 --> 20:34.520]  only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment which is a $12.95 value free
[20:34.520 --> 20:41.520]  call triple 8 use SFR 1 that number again is triple 8 use SFR 1 or check them out

[26:30.080 --> 26:34.080]  needs to be done that this this man can't get away with this he needs to lose his
[26:34.080 --> 26:38.000]  job he needs to get in the unemployment line this needs to set a precedent that
[26:38.000 --> 26:42.160]  people can't cross this line this is one line that you can't cross let's just
[26:42.160 --> 26:45.680]  continue to get the word out to the mainstream media to just email them
[26:45.680 --> 26:49.640]  email them the audio clip the date the time you can even send my old press
[26:49.640 --> 26:53.880]  release in and let's just continue to call air radio america here radio
[26:53.880 --> 26:58.040]  america dot org the phone numbers at the bottom of their website the extension
[26:58.040 --> 27:03.720]  to the president is extension to 15 and his email if you go to prison planet
[27:03.720 --> 27:08.520]  dot com there's an article there about how he is having no disciplinary action
[27:08.520 --> 27:12.160]  and you can find his email down on the bottom of the headline is reagan's quote
[27:12.160 --> 27:17.040]  apology week and disingenuous and you know when i when i got on the show he
[27:17.040 --> 27:21.360]  didn't even admit fully what his comments were he tried to sweep it under the
[27:21.360 --> 27:25.360]  rug and make it seem like he said you know if somebody were to shoot me that
[27:25.360 --> 27:28.240]  he'd like to pay for the bullets i had to correct him and make it clear that he
[27:28.240 --> 27:32.440]  was urging people to do that myself and others and i see that you guys posted
[27:32.440 --> 27:35.800]  some of his other just absolutely appalling yeah you know let's uh...
[27:35.800 --> 27:39.720]  let's just kill babies and uh... i believe i've heard him say that they're in
[27:39.720 --> 27:43.200]  that same clip that there won't be peace in the middle east until all of them are
[27:43.200 --> 27:44.040]  dead
[27:44.040 --> 27:46.800]  you know yeah i love a total genocide
[27:46.800 --> 27:49.600]  this is a high-level republican strategist in that
[27:49.600 --> 27:51.280]  you know i don't know what
[27:51.280 --> 27:54.320]  what kind of a strategy they have over there in the middle east but that that
[27:54.320 --> 27:56.000]  just is the the worst
[27:56.000 --> 27:56.720]  uh...
[27:56.720 --> 28:00.600]  genocide i mean maybe he's a strategist for the nazi party i'm not really sure
[28:00.600 --> 28:02.040]  exactly what
[28:02.040 --> 28:05.720]  what kind of a party would be uh... employing him for his ideas because
[28:05.720 --> 28:07.240]  that's just utterly
[28:07.240 --> 28:08.520]  ridiculous but
[28:08.520 --> 28:11.680]  i don't even know at this point i'm just gonna turn up the heat and i'm still
[28:11.680 --> 28:13.480]  i'm not calling down about this
[28:13.480 --> 28:16.920]  it's been a couple days now and i think he's just hoping that's gonna go sweep
[28:16.920 --> 28:19.520]  under the rug that people are going to forget about this but let's continue the
[28:19.520 --> 28:20.360]  calls
[28:20.360 --> 28:24.000]  the communications director in the philly director over there at uh... his
[28:24.000 --> 28:27.120]  syndicator said that they've been getting hundreds of calls so if you're
[28:27.120 --> 28:30.400]  going to call don't just call it say that he should be you know he's the
[28:30.400 --> 28:33.840]  trader and he's the market dot just say hey he needs to be fired immediately
[28:33.840 --> 28:35.280]  this is unacceptable
[28:35.280 --> 28:37.400]  and let's not harass these people
[28:37.400 --> 28:39.840]  and let's keep it civil but just a man look
[28:39.840 --> 28:43.760]  this this is unacceptable this has never been said in the history of radio
[28:43.760 --> 28:48.200]  uh... and it needs to stop immediately you you need to remove his platform for
[28:48.200 --> 28:49.520]  this is career
[28:49.520 --> 28:50.640]  needs to be over
[28:50.640 --> 28:53.720]  absolutely and uh... our listeners can make it happen if they want to make it
[28:53.720 --> 28:54.840]  happen that's the
[28:54.840 --> 28:58.240]  that's the power of the individual mark if we all come together
[28:58.240 --> 29:01.080]  if we all say that we have the power if we all
[29:01.080 --> 29:04.440]  email this guy if we all call his office things are going to get done and things
[29:04.440 --> 29:06.200]  are going to get done if nobody does
[29:06.200 --> 29:07.000]  anything
[29:07.000 --> 29:10.280]  i want to shift gears a little bit back to that uh... point we ended with uh...

[33:04.720 --> 33:08.240]  meeting is important because you're gonna have David Rockefeller there every
[33:08.240 --> 33:13.240]  year okay you're gonna have the heads of the industries that matter aka Google is
[33:13.240 --> 33:18.640]  there yeah I wonder why Google was there this year Microsoft is there weird I
[33:18.640 --> 33:22.280]  think they had a neuroscience professor and some kind of a crazy
[33:22.280 --> 33:25.880]  psychologist there this year probably for their little psyops that they love to
[33:25.880 --> 33:29.920]  play against us they had Bernanke there head of the Federal Reserve Bank okay
[33:29.920 --> 33:33.280]  Condoleezza Rice is there you can be sure she'll be in the next administration
[33:33.280 --> 33:39.280]  somewhere you can bet it all right Wolfowitz is there you bet Wolfowitz is
[33:39.280 --> 33:43.360]  one of those guys that's really been a ball player for a while and he just
[33:43.360 --> 33:46.920]  kind of stays in the backdrop getting minimal press attention but he he's a
[33:46.920 --> 33:49.760]  real player he's one of the names that I probably would have named with Reagan
[33:49.760 --> 33:53.000]  when he was asking me about names Cheney was one of them I would definitely say
[33:53.000 --> 33:57.280]  that Wolfowitz at least you know think tanked it you look at those project for
[33:57.280 --> 34:00.400]  a new American Century documents and they're just disgusting you know they
[34:00.400 --> 34:06.080]  took the PNAC site down last month right mark we still don't know that some
[34:06.080 --> 34:08.760]  listeners are hearing about this for the first time not everybody turns into the
[34:08.760 --> 34:12.280]  show every day and I don't want to let this overshadow operation and form the
[34:12.280 --> 34:17.280]  soldiers which is our plan that's already in motion to send DVDs and emails and
[34:17.280 --> 34:21.960]  and letters to the troops stationed in Iraq and again you can get information
[34:21.960 --> 34:26.160]  just Google you know go to my site or just Google how to send packages to troops
[34:26.160 --> 34:29.520]  and you could find out you can sign up with certain organizations churches
[34:29.520 --> 34:33.840]  adopt a u.s. soldier dot org there's also programs you can sign up and get
[34:33.840 --> 34:37.720]  email addresses of the troops if you don't want to spend the shipping to send
[34:37.720 --> 34:41.520]  stuff to them and you can just just write them letters send them emails then
[34:41.520 --> 34:45.400]  them google links and YouTube videos and all sorts of stuff or even links to
[34:45.400 --> 34:49.240]  prisonplanet.com and let's befriend these people and let's have some new
[34:49.240 --> 34:53.520]  pen pals over there and and this is just going to expand operation and form the
[34:53.520 --> 34:57.640]  soldiers to an unprecedented level and I think that this is we're going to get
[34:57.640 --> 35:02.080]  all the soldiers now talking about this they get in the emails and create a
[35:02.080 --> 35:06.440]  good safe environment for them to discuss these issues with each other so that
[35:06.440 --> 35:10.120]  soldiers that have previously suspected this or or a part of the movement
[35:10.120 --> 35:15.640]  already can then speak up and not be feared about any form of retribution
[35:15.640 --> 35:21.360]  absolutely and you can find out all that information over at markdice.com you
[35:21.360 --> 35:25.040]  know let's make those packages fun too I mean put some food that you would want
[35:25.040 --> 35:30.120]  to eat in there you know stacks of DVDs who knows if you've got a little
[35:30.120 --> 35:33.440]  extra scratch maybe one of those portable DVD players maybe you know an
[35:33.440 --> 35:37.400]  iPod or a Zoom or there's a lot of cheap media players out there now you get for
[35:37.400 --> 35:40.760]  like $30 to have a screen and you load them up with these kind of
[35:40.760 --> 35:43.920]  documentaries all you tech heads out there this is important because these
[35:43.920 --> 35:47.520]  people are going to come back to this country and chances are they're going to
[35:47.520 --> 35:53.000]  be working in security forces and unfortunately our police and our
[35:53.000 --> 35:57.160]  security in general our National Guard our military is becoming more and more
[35:57.160 --> 36:00.840]  privatized and things like blackwater you're going to see them on the streets
[36:00.840 --> 36:04.040]  of this country and do you want soldiers that are completely and totally
[36:04.040 --> 36:08.040]  brainwashed and figure that we're just like totally dehumanized pieces of
[36:08.040 --> 36:10.800]  trash do you want people that are actually going to give a second thought
[36:10.800 --> 36:15.400]  and maybe help the resistance John I'm going to call you John I'm sorry now
[36:15.400 --> 36:19.120]  also the if you're going to send the DVDs if you're going to send original
[36:19.120 --> 36:22.920]  copies that's fine I would almost put a new label over the DVD and don't send
[36:22.920 --> 36:25.800]  the box because I think people are going to go through these boxes if they see
[36:25.800 --> 36:29.000]  DVDs with 9-11 this and 9-11 that they're not going to want the troops to
[36:29.000 --> 36:34.480]  get that so maybe just put label it you know Iron Man DVD pre-release before
[36:34.480 --> 36:38.360]  it's in stores or some some new cool movie that's in theaters that wouldn't
[36:38.360 --> 36:42.240]  have been you know they would have had a chance to not see yet and then get that
[36:42.240 --> 36:46.240]  out there yeah you're right send food and canned goods you know maybe send some
[36:46.240 --> 36:50.640]  extra socks and some things to them some board games you know something to help
[36:50.640 --> 36:55.080]  make their time over there a little bit more more easy for them and then work
[36:55.080 --> 37:00.080]  in some good stuff and and let's just continue to to unleash operation and
[37:00.080 --> 37:05.680]  form the soldiers as well as operation file fire Michael Reagan yeah absolutely
[37:05.680 --> 37:09.320]  and you know that was what was successful back in the days of Kazan
[37:09.320 --> 37:13.520]  Morpheus and all these peer-to-peer networks people would relabel loose
[37:13.520 --> 37:17.600]  change and they would relabel road to tyranny as the latest Hollywood block
[37:17.600 --> 37:21.320]  buster and when people would go to download you know like Superman or
[37:21.320 --> 37:25.640]  Spider-Man they would really get one of these these movies and hopefully you
[37:25.640 --> 37:28.640]  know within the first 90 seconds or so you could catch their interest and
[37:28.640 --> 37:31.880]  everybody's gonna watch them and if you do label them like that there's more of
[37:31.880 --> 37:35.440]  a chance that they're gonna have the entire unit gathered around psyched up
[37:35.440 --> 37:41.520]  to see it it's true it's true let's be honest and you know a lot of people are
[37:41.520 --> 37:45.280]  gonna be like oh that's deceptive well you know unfortunately the people that
[37:45.280 --> 37:48.880]  are doing this are deceptive on a whole nother level and the difference between
[37:48.880 --> 37:52.600]  us and them is that you know we want to love them we want them to be part of
[37:52.600 --> 37:55.520]  society and they just want to kill us you know the people that run the show
[37:55.520 --> 38:00.080]  they want to kill and enslave us and that's what's so scary to me you know
[38:00.080 --> 38:03.600]  they they pose as these Christian conservatives mark and that's what
[38:03.600 --> 38:07.760]  really really freaks me out is that people really think that Bush is a
[38:07.760 --> 38:12.960]  Christian and he's just a puppet sure but on the whole you know the whole
[38:12.960 --> 38:16.200]  Republican thing is all about being conservative and Christian and they're
[38:16.200 --> 38:20.400]  anything but I mean they're into the occult this is not like my opinion this
[38:20.400 --> 38:25.920]  is what they're into mark yeah this is this is an aspect where it's such an
[38:25.920 --> 38:31.080]  esoteric aspect and it's kind of the the ultra advanced PhD level of the New
[38:31.080 --> 38:34.400]  World Order I mean there's so much so much stuff that people can understand
[38:34.400 --> 38:37.680]  about their loss of our freedoms and the criminal activities within the
[38:37.680 --> 38:40.880]  government but when you start going down that road you do lose some people but
[38:40.880 --> 38:44.680]  it's it's very true and you know Adolf Hitler and his highest level people were
[38:44.680 --> 38:49.600]  into the occult they were inspired by a lot of Elena Blavatsky and the secret
[38:49.600 --> 38:53.240]  doctor in a book which says the Lucifer's good that that Satan's good
[38:53.240 --> 38:57.880]  that Satan is the Christ and the Savior and this same belief system is is been
[38:57.880 --> 39:03.200]  practiced by by a megalomaniac and by ultra powerful people and within high
[39:03.200 --> 39:07.680]  level secret societies for really thousands of years and in Bush and all
[39:07.680 --> 39:12.280]  his cabal are no different the Bohemian Grove ceremonies coming up here in a
[39:12.280 --> 39:16.600]  couple weeks and they're going to go have their annual Moloch sacrifice
[39:16.600 --> 39:20.680]  burning an effigy at the altar of of Moloch and the demon from the Old
[39:20.680 --> 39:24.520]  Testament where people used to burn people alive but at the altar and here
[39:24.520 --> 39:30.600]  they are reenacting it in a way that that's really just disgusting and it's
[39:30.600 --> 39:33.480]  you know everybody I don't know if anybody knows this if everybody knows
[39:33.480 --> 39:36.040]  this the listenership I know the listenership is growing so much and
[39:36.040 --> 39:40.320]  people the movement's expanding so much so the Bohemian Grove's coming up here
[39:40.320 --> 39:43.080]  we're gonna be launching operation exposed the Bohemian Grove try to get
[39:43.080 --> 39:46.560]  that under the mainstream press and and really let everybody understand what it
[39:46.560 --> 39:49.520]  is they're doing out there and the implications of their lakeside talks
[39:49.520 --> 39:53.840]  and their their off the record policy discussions and this is not just a
[39:53.840 --> 39:58.960]  party for them this is this is the implementing and discussing the next
[39:58.960 --> 40:05.080]  round of of tyranny that they're gonna be implementing absolutely and for those
[40:05.080 --> 40:09.120]  who don't know for the new listeners the guys that are going oh my god what did I
[40:09.120 --> 40:14.920]  tune into I haven't heard this before well just Google cremation of care go
[40:14.920 --> 40:18.640]  to YouTube and just check out the ceremony it's I mean first of all you
[40:18.640 --> 40:21.720]  can do a quick image search you know and you can find out that everything we're
[40:21.720 --> 40:25.880]  saying is true and you can see the likes of Newt Gingrich and Alan Greenspan and
[40:25.880 --> 40:30.840]  Bush senior and Bush Jr. yucking it up there you can see Reagan when he was a
[40:30.840 --> 40:35.200]  B movie star at the Grove right across the table from Richard Nixon you can see
[40:35.200 --> 40:38.840]  all this you can see how much Schmidt giving a speech before you know the
[40:38.840 --> 40:43.360]  next rung of the elite remember that there are rungs not everybody's on the
[40:43.360 --> 40:48.080]  inside and it's quite the status symbol to get into the Bohemian Grove an all
[40:48.080 --> 40:52.200]  male club 3,000 of the most powerful people from around the world mostly
[40:52.200 --> 40:58.040]  Anglo-Saxon European deal but they're doing anything but you know they they
[40:58.040 --> 41:03.240]  they're literally cross-dressers to mark it's just so bizarre I mean they put on
[41:03.240 --> 41:08.320]  plays where they enact these perverted things as women and I just I can't
[41:08.320 --> 41:11.920]  believe it but you know I have the annals sitting about 15 feet away from me
[41:11.920 --> 41:15.800]  and you open it up and one of the one of the pictures I love that we haven't
[41:15.800 --> 41:20.200]  published yet but I should publish it is this news reporter he's like a he's
[41:20.200 --> 41:25.000]  either a news reporter or a cartoonist or whatever and he's drawing how you know
[41:25.000 --> 41:27.960]  there's there is a news reporter there doing the news but then he's thinking
[41:27.960 --> 41:32.240]  about how he's actually a member of the Grove and he's in the little ceremonial
[41:32.240 --> 41:36.400]  garb he's in the hood and cave and he's got the candle and I'm gonna myself oh
[41:36.400 --> 41:43.400]  my god this is just so unbelievable but you remember the rumors that the mob
[41:43.400 --> 41:46.760]  had photographs of Jay Edgar Hoover dressed in drag and then he was a
[41:46.760 --> 41:49.880]  cross-dresser I just can't help but think that those were photos that leaked
[41:49.880 --> 41:53.840]  out of the Grove perhaps something and I would bet my bottom dollar on it yeah
[41:53.840 --> 41:58.040]  and one of the annals and and I mean for that information to be leaked you know
[41:58.040 --> 42:02.840]  decades ago to just crushed everybody's I'm sure they just tried to wipe that on
[42:02.840 --> 42:07.400]  the rug as much as they could and and yeah so it this is more than bizarre this
[42:07.400 --> 42:12.080]  is a whole hour or a whole three-hour show in and of itself but you know I
[42:12.080 --> 42:16.400]  got a run here yes I just want to thank everybody I want to thank everybody
[42:16.400 --> 42:20.200]  again for for just getting on board with this and let's let's just continue to
[42:20.200 --> 42:24.160]  send the message here let's not let this die down until something is done oh if
[42:24.160 --> 42:30.280]  we just if we just continue to apply the pressure civilly and responsibly I think
[42:30.280 --> 42:33.400]  that we can get this man fired at the minimum and again there's an ongoing
[42:33.400 --> 42:37.040]  case that's being investigated by the proper authorities and I'm pursuing
[42:37.040 --> 42:41.720]  other avenues as well so I want to thank everybody again I got a run all right
[42:41.720 --> 42:44.880]  Mark thank you so much and actually we're gonna play some more of that clip
[42:44.880 --> 42:50.320]  where Reagan tries to give a half hearted apology to Mark dice again go to
[42:50.320 --> 42:55.280]  mark dice calm become of this soldier outreach program and I'm gonna give the
[42:55.280 --> 42:58.200]  number out one more time if you want to make a difference you can call the
[42:58.200 --> 43:07.040]  president of Radio America his name is Jim Roberts it is 703 302 1000
[43:07.040 --> 43:14.280]  extension 215 that's 703 302 1000 all right let's let's play this clip because
[43:14.280 --> 43:18.920]  again I mean Reagan is so obnoxious again we are helping the Taliban escape
[43:18.920 --> 43:21.920]  and then saying it's a threat in Afghanistan think about that our
[43:21.920 --> 43:25.360]  soldiers are gonna be in the Middle East forever I know a lot of you out there
[43:25.360 --> 43:31.760]  have a brother a sister a cousin an uncle overseas you know perhaps a mother
[43:31.760 --> 43:37.160]  a father so you know they're not fighting a just war right now they're
[43:37.160 --> 43:44.000]  really fighting for tyrants it's it's oh man makes me sick new american century
[43:44.000 --> 43:46.720]  go look at the project for the new american century where they called for
[43:46.720 --> 43:50.640]  a new Pearl Harbor attack so they could carry out their agenda in the Middle
[43:50.640 --> 43:54.640]  East you mean you didn't tell me you have no names he did not plan this
[43:54.640 --> 43:58.480]  George Bush is a spokesperson and a propaganda and you phony conservatives
[43:58.480 --> 44:03.060]  should be ashamed of him but you have no names impeachment well nobody but
[44:03.060 --> 44:09.720]  lately they should be gone January 22,009 mark but you have no names we have
[44:09.720 --> 44:14.480]  look we have the declassified documents we have instances of terrorism we have
[44:14.480 --> 44:18.920]  all of the evidence that something happened here that is not being told to
[44:18.920 --> 44:24.240]  us we need a new investigation do you know that only 84% or 84% of Americans
[44:24.240 --> 44:27.480]  think that there we've been lied to about the circumstances 9-11 are
[44:27.480 --> 44:31.760]  demanding a new investigation last September 11th at ground zero there
[44:31.760 --> 44:36.000]  were thousands of individuals marching demanding a new investigation like I
[44:36.000 --> 44:39.280]  said Bill Boyle the head of the coalition of 9-11 families that's the
[44:39.280 --> 44:44.920]  largest organization of 9-11 widows he says that half of the family members
[44:44.920 --> 44:48.120]  believe that 9-11 was an inside job so I'm saying that this needs to be

[55:44.440 --> 55:48.800]  little bit of domestic news because we went over what happened in Afghanistan
[55:48.800 --> 55:55.960]  once again Friday they report oh prison attacked thousand militants out 400 of
[55:55.960 --> 55:59.400]  them Taliban Monday they report oh Taliban has a new stronghold in the

[56:04.080 --> 56:09.600]  attack that prison and free those people I wonder why but right now remember the
[56:09.600 --> 56:16.040]  DNC is out in Colorado and right now they're drilling all sorts of good stuff
[56:16.040 --> 56:23.680]  oh wait not good stuff police state stuff domestic urban warfare drills
[56:23.680 --> 56:30.360]  against the people for this DNC thing you see that whole recreate 68 thing I
[56:30.360 --> 56:35.120]  guess got broken up but all the same people are behind the new organization
[56:35.120 --> 56:38.880]  they're just trying to shadow what they try to do you know they don't want people
[56:38.880 --> 56:42.240]  to understand that they were trying to provoke violence at that event telling
[56:42.240 --> 56:49.080]  people to wear shields throw red paint destroy cameras real nonsense can't get
[56:49.080 --> 56:53.680]  anything done that way that's not the model folks they're called provocateurs
[56:53.680 --> 56:59.080]  they did that in Seattle okay at the WTO you don't believe me you couldn't even
[56:59.080 --> 57:02.880]  by the second day you couldn't even walk around with a button that was anti
[57:02.880 --> 57:10.520]  WTO to go to work and it was all provocateur a bunch of people hired by
[57:10.520 --> 57:14.880]  the State Department I believe they they hold them up they let them destroy a
[57:14.880 --> 57:18.400]  whole bunch of stuff and then they just squelch down on the actual legitimate
[57:18.400 --> 57:21.240]  protesters and that's what they're hoping to do here and they're prepping for it
[57:21.240 --> 57:27.280]  you see there are black helicopters flying around right now in Colorado you
[57:27.280 --> 57:29.840]  know the black helicopters that supposedly don't exist that's another
[57:29.840 --> 57:33.320]  great part of 9-11 Chronicles truth rising I think it's even in the credits
[57:33.320 --> 57:37.760]  one of these guys gets confronted and he says honestly I think that's black
[57:37.760 --> 57:42.240]  helicopter stuff and I think to myself wait a minute black hell does that mean
[57:42.240 --> 57:47.600]  he believes it because uh black helicopters obviously exist folks how
[57:47.600 --> 57:53.080]  long ago did we have a Hollywood movie called black hawk down there are black
[57:53.080 --> 57:57.880]  helicopters and yes they have been in the state don't uh don't believe me you

[1:00:22.120 --> 1:00:27.440]  a half dozen military and law enforcement helicopters buzzed above the Pepsi Center
[1:00:27.440 --> 1:00:31.960]  Monday night in a drill to train for the Democratic National Convention in
[1:00:31.960 --> 1:00:36.920]  August Denver police said now there's another article saying that they're
[1:00:36.920 --> 1:00:40.520]  doing it for an emergency but it's not for the DNC yeah okay sure you're not
[1:00:40.520 --> 1:00:44.320]  sure you're not running urban warfare drills they might kill some people there
[1:00:44.320 --> 1:00:49.440]  this time folks think about that think about that they kill somebody at the
[1:00:49.440 --> 1:00:53.160]  World Series by shooting one of those non-lethal weapons into their eyes remember
[1:00:53.160 --> 1:00:58.400]  that outside of Boston right through this girl's eye bam come on did they
[1:00:58.400 --> 1:01:02.640]  really need to do that point blank range okay all right but this is serious
[1:01:02.640 --> 1:01:06.480]  because this isn't just gonna be riot cops this is gonna be actual military
[1:01:06.480 --> 1:01:11.480]  there you bet it will be anyway maneuvers over downtown maneuvers over
[1:01:11.480 --> 1:01:15.520]  downtown were coordinated by the US Department of Justice but authorities
[1:01:15.520 --> 1:01:20.640]  would not release details of the training weird hmm they didn't want to
[1:01:20.640 --> 1:01:25.720]  release the details of that I wonder why the flights drew attention of several
[1:01:25.720 --> 1:01:30.360]  concerned downtown residents you think black helicopters in your town you think
[1:01:30.360 --> 1:01:34.120]  that really that that caused concern or probably cause concern because people
[1:01:34.120 --> 1:01:40.000]  go that's black helicopter stuff there are no black helicopters ridiculousness
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:48.560]  absolutely ridiculousness man it man it's like SWAT right over there said
[1:01:48.560 --> 1:01:53.840]  Lotto resident Tom copper Schmidt as he watched the helicopters from his back
[1:01:53.840 --> 1:02:00.240]  balcony yeah you think it's like SWAT oh boy oh boy so the hospitals are also
[1:02:00.240 --> 1:02:05.280]  holding a disaster drill you see after they shoot everybody and they baton
[1:02:05.280 --> 1:02:09.120]  people and they have their little provocateurs that start the whole thing
[1:02:09.120 --> 1:02:13.160]  hold away they're gonna have to start wheeling people into the hospital so
[1:02:13.160 --> 1:02:17.640]  eight Denver hospitals held drills Tuesday that's today guys to test their
[1:02:17.640 --> 1:02:22.560]  abilities to respond it is in a disaster that would injure thousands of people
[1:02:22.560 --> 1:02:26.400]  unbelievable or was that last Tuesday might have been last Tuesday maybe not
[1:02:26.400 --> 1:02:32.800]  it's also Denver post calm hospitals victims role-play Pepsi Center disaster
[1:02:32.800 --> 1:02:40.680]  as convention looms unbelievable the mock exercise a dirty bomb explosion at a
[1:02:40.680 --> 1:02:44.840]  Pepsi Center packed with 20,000 people was one of the largest ever cooperative
[1:02:44.840 --> 1:02:49.080]  drills for the city's hospitals organizer said can you imagine that if a
[1:02:49.080 --> 1:02:57.680]  dirty but I hate the term dirty bomb okay that's like how do I explain this I
[1:02:57.680 --> 1:03:01.480]  mean let's face it everybody everybody were were shooting cruise missiles into
[1:03:01.480 --> 1:03:06.560]  in the Middle East they're getting depleted uranium all over okay do you
[1:03:06.560 --> 1:03:11.080]  poisonings everywhere that's like a dirty bomb kidding me so it's just it's
[1:03:11.080 --> 1:03:14.440]  just you know another explosion of course there's gonna be some kind of
[1:03:14.440 --> 1:03:18.360]  radiation but it's not gonna not it's gonna be good for you especially they
[1:03:18.360 --> 1:03:22.560]  blow up 20,000 people that's great let's drill 20,000 deaths that's that's
[1:03:22.560 --> 1:03:28.840]  awesome about 140 volunteers participated in the city-wide drill many of them
[1:03:28.840 --> 1:03:34.360]  acting as victims see that's about right though if all if over like a hundred
[1:03:34.360 --> 1:03:38.880]  or so act as victims they'll probably only hurt and kill you know they I don't
[1:03:38.880 --> 1:03:41.640]  see them killing more than a dozen or so people unless it gets out of hand but
[1:03:41.640 --> 1:03:45.600]  they'll hurt at least a hundred maybe two though the hospitals knew there would
[1:03:45.600 --> 1:03:50.280]  be a drill the details became known only as the scenario unfolded the office of
[1:03:50.280 --> 1:03:54.520]  emergency management alerted hospitals about 9 a.m. that a chemical bomb had
[1:03:54.520 --> 1:04:00.360]  exploded at the arena shortly after about 10 volunteer victims lined in the
[1:04:00.360 --> 1:04:04.200]  wall outside the emergency waiting to be hosed down oh that's nice so they got
[1:04:04.200 --> 1:04:09.000]  the oh they got the decamp contamination centers that's that's scary
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:13.240]  alright let's look at this other drill I think this is the one trying to say
[1:04:13.240 --> 1:04:18.040]  that this isn't actually for the DNC where's this off of this is the Rocky
[1:04:18.040 --> 1:04:21.680]  Mountain news see this gets published although Denver Post also gets
[1:04:21.680 --> 1:04:25.920]  published but this looks like it's straight out of the paper drilling for
[1:04:25.920 --> 1:04:29.480]  disaster info with the DNC in mind responders learn from quote-unquote
[1:04:29.480 --> 1:04:33.720]  emergency we'll go over the article on the other side it's the Alex Jones show
[1:04:33.720 --> 1:04:38.960]  and we're gonna have Paul Craig Roberts coming up for you after this
[1:04:38.960 --> 1:04:57.640]  it is a big idea a new world order in the near future earth is dominated by a

[1:08:19.520 --> 1:08:24.440]  drilling for disaster with the DNC in mind responders learn from form of what
[1:08:24.440 --> 1:08:31.680]  emergency an explosion at the Pepsi Center pesticides perhaps 20,000
[1:08:31.680 --> 1:08:36.920]  victims he really playing up the fear angle over at the Rocky Mountain news
[1:08:36.920 --> 1:08:41.760]  victims were volunteers of course as the drill unfolded the men and women who
[1:08:41.760 --> 1:08:45.040]  would have to respond to such a disaster learn numerous lessons all about
[1:08:45.040 --> 1:08:49.800]  learning numerous lessons not stopping it but just getting ready to take care
[1:08:49.800 --> 1:08:57.040]  of everybody that's good take care of the bodies black helicopters urban
[1:08:57.040 --> 1:09:01.240]  warfare drills well you know what let's let's let that story develop honestly
[1:09:01.240 --> 1:09:06.800]  let's uh let's get that one out there we're gonna wait because we're gonna
[1:09:06.800 --> 1:09:10.200]  have some video for you on that and there's gonna be a ton of stuff posted on
[1:09:10.200 --> 1:09:15.080]  it and I hope a lot of people show up to the DNC to protest but to protest the
[1:09:15.080 --> 1:09:19.560]  right way on the right issues you know not to worship you know the
[1:09:19.560 --> 1:09:28.920]  Republicans not to be pro-war you know but to be there to say hey we know that
[1:09:28.920 --> 1:09:35.040]  Barack Obama is not here for change we know that him and Hillary met at the
[1:09:35.040 --> 1:09:40.520]  same time that the Bilderberg group met in the same place well Jim Johnson who
[1:09:40.520 --> 1:09:44.560]  then was there to decide who was gonna be his running mate was one of the
[1:09:44.560 --> 1:09:48.640]  attendees on the list I mean how obvious does it have to be Tucker called his
[1:09:48.640 --> 1:09:52.600]  campaign up and asked him where he was and said asked him if he had attended
[1:09:52.600 --> 1:09:58.400]  the Bilderberg meeting and they refused to answer I mean what's it gonna take
[1:09:58.400 --> 1:10:03.360]  seriously what is it gonna take for people to wake up for people to
[1:10:03.360 --> 1:10:07.760]  understand that the mainstream media is completely controlled and that the
[1:10:07.760 --> 1:10:10.520]  police are out of control it's bad enough the police are out of control but
[1:10:10.520 --> 1:10:14.040]  now they're gonna have urban warfare training and I got this story in front
[1:10:14.040 --> 1:10:17.400]  of me I should probably wait till the final hour and I'll probably show it
[1:10:17.400 --> 1:10:24.800]  again in the final hour but down in Florida down in Florida there are these
[1:10:24.800 --> 1:10:30.080]  new sheriff t-shirts okay one of them says if you can't stand behind our troops
[1:10:30.080 --> 1:10:33.840]  do us all a favor and stand in front of them so it's like oh if you're not for
[1:10:33.840 --> 1:10:38.240]  the war why don't we just shoot you and then the other one is the scumbag
[1:10:38.240 --> 1:10:46.320]  eradication team and it's a spot a smiling moustache police officer with
[1:10:46.320 --> 1:10:51.760]  a belt with his little weapons on his belt dumping scumbags into a toilet I
[1:10:51.760 --> 1:10:54.920]  think there's like five or six legs coming out it looks like they're all
[1:10:54.920 --> 1:11:01.360]  dead by now and it says not in our town we're the scumbag eradication team you
[1:11:01.360 --> 1:11:07.160]  know no judge no jury no trial you're just automatically a scumbag apparently
[1:11:07.160 --> 1:11:12.440]  if a police officer deems you so and now he's gonna wear a t-shirt to encourage
[1:11:12.440 --> 1:11:17.480]  it what do we got coming up I think I'm gonna start taking calls in the next
[1:11:17.480 --> 1:11:20.400]  segment guys so if you want to jump in and you want to talk about real issues
[1:11:20.400 --> 1:11:23.840]  because I you know yesterday had some problems with callers calling in about
[1:11:23.840 --> 1:11:29.080]  some nonsense let's listen keep the nonsense to the shows about you know
[1:11:29.080 --> 1:11:34.720]  the paranormal and you know the UFOs do that somewhere else okay that's not
[1:11:34.720 --> 1:11:36.920]  what we're talking about here we're talking about real issues we're talking
[1:11:36.920 --> 1:11:43.400]  about politics I don't want to hear that garbage well it looks like the
[1:11:43.400 --> 1:11:47.400]  Japanese Times believe it's the Japanese Times mainstream publication over in
[1:11:47.400 --> 1:11:53.800]  Japan has now done a story on Fujita it's the Japan Times online and it says
[1:11:53.800 --> 1:12:01.280]  lawmaker takes 9-11 doubts global in September 2003 and the I'm sorry in the
[1:12:01.280 --> 1:12:06.160]  two September 2003 article for the Guardian newspaper Michael Meacher who
[1:12:06.160 --> 1:12:11.600]  served as Tony Blair's environment minister from May 1997 to June 2003
[1:12:11.600 --> 1:12:16.040]  shocked the establishment by calling the global war on terrorism quote-unquote
[1:12:16.040 --> 1:12:21.160]  bogus good man Meacher even more controversially he implied that the
[1:12:21.160 --> 1:12:25.240]  United States government either allowed 9-11 to happen or played some role in
[1:12:25.240 --> 1:12:29.720]  the destruction wrought wrought that day besides Meacher few politicians have
[1:12:29.720 --> 1:12:34.200]  publicly questioned America's official 9-11 narrative until diet member Yushika
[1:12:34.200 --> 1:12:38.960]  Fujita and Fujita I've extensively covered over to my blog at loose change
[1:12:38.960 --> 1:12:43.280]  911.com and there's been a ton of stories over at info wars.com and
[1:12:43.280 --> 1:12:48.120]  prisonplanet.com in January 2008 Fujita a member of the Democratic Party of
[1:12:48.120 --> 1:12:53.760]  Japan asked the Japanese Parliament and Prime Minister Yasuo Fukudo to explain
[1:12:53.760 --> 1:12:58.080]  gaping holes in the official 9-11 story that various groups including those who
[1:12:58.080 --> 1:13:03.040]  called themselves the 9-11 truth movement claimed you have exposed Fujita
[1:13:03.040 --> 1:13:06.240]  along with a growing number of individuals including European and
[1:13:06.240 --> 1:13:09.480]  American politicians that's right you know let's not forget because Sinich
[1:13:09.480 --> 1:13:13.360]  recently impeached the president or tried to impeach the president three of
[1:13:13.360 --> 1:13:18.760]  them involving 9-11 are leading a charge to conduct a thorough independent
[1:13:18.760 --> 1:13:23.520]  investigation of what happened on September 11th 2001 oh look at that we
[1:13:23.520 --> 1:13:27.720]  get a we get a little plug here I didn't know it three or four years ago I saw
[1:13:27.720 --> 1:13:31.480]  some internet videos like loose change and 9-11 in plain sight and I began to
[1:13:31.480 --> 1:13:35.000]  ask questions Fujita said in an interview but I still couldn't believe this was
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:40.840]  done by anyone but Al Qaeda last year I watched more videos in red books written
[1:13:40.840 --> 1:13:44.280]  by professor David Ray Griffin a professor emeritus of philosophy of
[1:13:44.280 --> 1:13:48.920]  of religion and theology at Claremont graduate University who wrote the most
[1:13:48.920 --> 1:13:53.240]  famous truth movement book the new Pearl Harbor about things such as the
[1:13:53.240 --> 1:13:56.320]  collapse of World Trade Center number seven this building which was never hit
[1:13:56.320 --> 1:13:59.720]  by an airplane collapsed straight down between the videos showing the way it
[1:13:59.720 --> 1:14:03.000]  fell and the numerous reports of explosions many are convinced that this
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:07.320]  building was demolished Fujita's presentation on the diet and Fukuda
[1:14:07.320 --> 1:14:12.160]  focused on a great deal on yet another aspect of 9-11 that is now quite a few
[1:14:12.160 --> 1:14:16.640]  around the world find extremely suspicious the Pentagon crash and it goes
[1:14:16.640 --> 1:14:21.200]  on quite a bit we should do a story over at a prison planet definitely about
[1:14:21.200 --> 1:14:25.920]  this and yeah you know he's really he's really trying to bring it to the
[1:14:25.920 --> 1:14:29.480]  forefront I think it needs to be brought to the forefront around the world I do
[1:14:29.480 --> 1:14:33.560]  think again that an international tribunal is not the way to go that we
[1:14:33.560 --> 1:14:36.960]  have to clean house from the inside we don't want to lose our Constitution and
[1:14:36.960 --> 1:14:40.240]  Bill of Rights I mean they're already eviscerated but I'd like to restore them
[1:14:40.240 --> 1:14:44.080]  for me this is a restoration movement this isn't a revolution I'm trying to
[1:14:44.080 --> 1:14:47.080]  restore the Bill of Rights and Constitution here for people I mean I'm
[1:14:47.080 --> 1:14:52.880]  trying to bring freedom back to America what do you think is it a good idea
[1:14:52.880 --> 1:14:55.880]  apparently a lot of people thought it was a good idea when they started
[1:14:55.880 --> 1:14:58.920]  donating to the Ron Paul campaign and he made millions and millions of dollars
[1:14:58.920 --> 1:15:03.260]  and broke through to the mainstream I had a number one New York Times sell best
[1:15:03.260 --> 1:15:08.120]  selling book with manifesto in the title apparently somebody's listening out
[1:15:08.120 --> 1:15:12.200]  there we're reaching some people the question is are you going to reach out
[1:15:12.200 --> 1:15:18.880]  are you going to go to info wars.com and get the movie that you think is the
[1:15:18.880 --> 1:15:22.800]  best way to wake somebody up now how do I do that everybody's like oh I don't
[1:15:22.800 --> 1:15:25.520]  know which one's the best I haven't even really watched anyone if you have an
[1:15:25.520 --> 1:15:28.920]  internet connection you go to video.google.com you type in terror storm
[1:15:28.920 --> 1:15:33.840]  okay you type in endgame you type in America freedom to fascism you type in
[1:15:33.840 --> 1:15:39.360]  loose change and you can watch them for free and then make the decision what you
[1:15:39.360 --> 1:15:45.960]  think's the best you get a copy of it you get it at home you burn it to DVD you
[1:15:45.960 --> 1:15:49.440]  burn a whole bunch of copies and you start handing them out or you hold a
[1:15:49.440 --> 1:15:53.840]  dinner party or the next time you get to together with your family you know at
[1:15:53.840 --> 1:15:58.680]  Christmas at Thanksgiving at Easter for the summer barbecue July 4th is
[1:15:58.680 --> 1:16:03.960]  coming up with the release of 9-eleven truth rising
[1:16:04.920 --> 1:16:10.320]  there's a whole lot out there that you can share that you can change people's
[1:16:10.320 --> 1:16:15.240]  minds I mean these are the tools I'm sorry but the vast public just doesn't
[1:16:15.240 --> 1:16:19.080]  read anymore you know books are great and I guess I guess some people are
[1:16:19.080 --> 1:16:24.040]  reading the Ron Paul fans are reading but most of your kids aren't reading
[1:16:24.040 --> 1:16:30.560]  unfortunately at least not anything but Rolling Stone and trashy teen mags the
[1:16:30.560 --> 1:16:34.000]  girls really love those teeny-bopper mags and then right right into womanhood
[1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:39.360]  man it's Harper's Bazaar it's Cosmopolitan home and garden I'm not
[1:16:39.360 --> 1:16:43.600]  saying guys aren't as as guilty with sports illustrated and maximum but it's
[1:16:43.600 --> 1:16:49.760]  all it's all like tabloid trash it's it's even it's a vault because of the
[1:16:49.760 --> 1:16:52.640]  tap again like I was making the point yesterday the tabloid trash was like
[1:16:52.640 --> 1:16:58.320]  entertainment tonight one hour on mainstream television that's it you
[1:16:58.320 --> 1:17:01.440]  know the rest of the news was pretty straightforward not saying it was great
[1:17:01.440 --> 1:17:04.160]  I'm not saying it wasn't you know part of the propaganda machine but they
[1:17:04.160 --> 1:17:07.960]  weren't reporting on Britney Spears and Paris Heldon or you know back in the day
[1:17:07.960 --> 1:17:11.440]  it would have been Madonna all the time she had to actually do something it
[1:17:11.440 --> 1:17:15.520]  wasn't just get up in the morning and now that's what the focus is there's
[1:17:15.520 --> 1:17:19.360]  entire channels dedicated to this nonsense those are the books that are I'm
[1:17:19.360 --> 1:17:26.080]  sorry the magazines the publications that are staying in business and I don't
[1:17:26.080 --> 1:17:29.560]  know I just feel like videos are the new way documentaries can wake people up in
[1:17:29.560 --> 1:17:34.680]  90 minutes or at least put something in their brain in 90 minutes think about
[1:17:34.680 --> 1:17:39.760]  that 90 minutes doesn't even take a day so that's why I want to encourage people
[1:17:39.760 --> 1:17:45.240]  to get these films get in game and hold the screening let's do this thing that's
[1:17:45.240 --> 1:17:48.320]  the only way that things are gonna change everybody always complains to me
[1:17:48.320 --> 1:17:53.360]  too that we don't have a solution well I keep telling you the solution the
[1:17:53.360 --> 1:17:58.720]  solution is to educate people get them to stop their sloth like behavior sitting
[1:17:58.720 --> 1:18:03.480]  on a couch drinking Jenny light at one in the afternoon and watching golf yeah
[1:18:03.480 --> 1:18:09.360]  because you know Tiger Woods and the PGA tour is so damn important we were
[1:18:09.360 --> 1:18:16.240]  actually all out to a lot to dinner or lunch in between there somewhere Rob
[1:18:16.240 --> 1:18:20.080]  Aaron myself and Alex and we're all just sitting there eating and then all
[1:18:20.080 --> 1:18:23.240]  of a sudden the place erupts and of course it's when Tiger Woods puts that
[1:18:23.240 --> 1:18:26.400]  ball on the hole everybody wants to see the ball go in the hole that's the
[1:18:26.400 --> 1:18:31.640]  problem you know what I want to see I want to see people motivated enough to
[1:18:31.640 --> 1:18:39.400]  go become a city council member run for Congress you know let's do it let's
[1:18:39.400 --> 1:18:42.720]  let's not only become you know the government let's become the mainstream
[1:18:42.720 --> 1:18:47.880]  media I see a lot of people doing that you know it's alternative media now but
[1:18:47.880 --> 1:18:52.600]  again Alex is starting a network and we're gonna need 24 hours of content a
[1:18:52.600 --> 1:18:57.360]  day on that network and I see people in we are changing again we're gonna have
[1:18:57.360 --> 1:19:02.520]  people from we are change Vancouver and we are change LA on I see what they're
[1:19:02.520 --> 1:19:06.840]  doing they're doing it up you know they're confronting the politicians
[1:19:06.840 --> 1:19:13.080]  they're becoming the media and student scholars recently put up a video again
[1:19:13.080 --> 1:19:17.880]  with John Edwards of Bilderberg I'll probably play that in the next segment
[1:19:17.880 --> 1:19:22.160]  where he talks about how he did give a speech there and then they ask him about
[1:19:22.160 --> 1:19:26.520]  the vice presidency he's like oh I wasn't the vice presidential candidate yet
[1:19:26.520 --> 1:19:30.400]  and he walks away but this is how we're gonna get it done we're gonna become the

[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:42.200]  right folks we're back it's the Alex Jones show I'm Jason Bermas I'll be
[1:24:42.200 --> 1:24:49.120]  sitting in all week and we do have Dr. Paul Craig Roberts on the line and he
[1:24:49.120 --> 1:24:53.720]  has a new article out there called elect Obama or fall into tyranny and I
[1:24:53.720 --> 1:24:57.560]  don't think we've had him on the program since Hillary has conceded and
[1:24:57.560 --> 1:25:02.160]  Obama will be the nominee for the Democrats I thank him for coming on
[1:25:02.160 --> 1:25:06.880]  Paul how are you doing hey Jason how are you I'm very I'm very well why don't
[1:25:06.880 --> 1:25:11.200]  you tell us a little bit about this article you wrote well this is a
[1:25:11.200 --> 1:25:35.200]  nation if I remember it I'm pointed out the two great big strikes against Obama one that he's groveling before the Israel lobby and would not represent any change in our warmonger policies in the Middle East and second that his economic advisors are leading
[1:25:35.200 --> 1:25:42.840]  apologists for offshoring which is destroying the the careers and livelihoods of
[1:25:42.840 --> 1:25:49.720]  millions of Americans and essentially putting tremendous pressure on the US
[1:25:49.720 --> 1:25:57.040]  dollar and I said that given those black marks he didn't look very good and so
[1:25:57.040 --> 1:26:05.560]  why should anybody vote for him and the answer I gave was that the Republican party
[1:26:05.560 --> 1:26:12.760]  has morphed into a brown shirt party it's just as bad on the same issues but
[1:26:12.760 --> 1:26:19.320]  they're also committed the Republican party is committed to elevating the
[1:26:19.320 --> 1:26:25.920]  power of the executive branch the presidency above the other branches
[1:26:25.920 --> 1:26:33.440]  indeed above the Constitution and that if a Republican was elected after the
[1:26:33.440 --> 1:26:41.000]  eight-year experience that we've had with Republicans it would remove the
[1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:48.440]  public's verdict on the misdeeds and criminal actions of the Republican
[1:26:48.440 --> 1:26:58.280]  party it would sort of be a justification for their policy of turning
[1:26:58.280 --> 1:27:03.760]  the presidency into some sort of a semi-addictatorship but you don't feel
[1:27:03.760 --> 1:27:08.200]  like that's gonna happen with the Democrats I mean I'm not well I don't
[1:27:08.200 --> 1:27:11.880]  think that would happen with the Democrats because there's a huge
[1:27:11.880 --> 1:27:16.880]  difference always in my lifetime between the Democrats and Republicans on
[1:27:16.880 --> 1:27:23.680]  civil liberties the Democratic deportees to the federal courts and the
[1:27:23.680 --> 1:27:27.920]  Supreme Court were always big defenders of civil liberties sometimes they went
[1:27:27.920 --> 1:27:33.440]  far too far and created new liberties that weren't in the Constitution such as
[1:27:33.440 --> 1:27:37.960]  the right of abortion and things like that but the Republicans have always
[1:27:37.960 --> 1:27:46.600]  seen civil liberty as coddling devices for criminals now it's civil
[1:27:46.600 --> 1:27:52.280]  liberty is a coddling device for terrorists and they simply oppose civil
[1:27:52.280 --> 1:27:57.000]  liberties they if you've seen any Republican other than Ron Paul defend
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:28:07.800]  habeas corpus or or defend the US statutory law against this rogue
[1:28:07.800 --> 1:28:11.840]  administration I mean we've had Bush admit that he violated the foreign
[1:28:11.840 --> 1:28:16.520]  intelligence surveillance act he's violated the US statutory law against
[1:28:16.520 --> 1:28:20.920]  torture as well as the international laws against torture to which we're
[1:28:20.920 --> 1:28:27.000]  signatory we had the Bush Attorney General Gonzalez testify before the
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:32.360]  Senate Judiciary Committee that Americans aren't given the right of habeas corpus
[1:28:32.360 --> 1:28:38.440]  by the Constitution so these people are just totally opposed to civil
[1:28:38.440 --> 1:28:43.320]  liberty and that means they're committed to tyranny and that I think is the
[1:28:43.320 --> 1:28:48.840]  essential difference in the parties and every other respect George Wallace was
[1:28:48.840 --> 1:28:52.840]  right 40 years ago when he said there's not a dime's worth difference but if you
[1:28:52.840 --> 1:28:59.400]  look at the court appointees you may remember the Berlin Court in Thurgood
[1:28:59.400 --> 1:29:05.640]  Marshall all these people were very much defenders of civil liberty not a
[1:29:05.640 --> 1:29:11.880]  single Republican on the court yet so that's my summation of what's at stake
[1:29:11.880 --> 1:29:15.960]  gotcha on the other side I want to get your take on a Cassinic's introducing
[1:29:15.960 --> 1:29:21.240]  35 articles of impeachment and we think Obama's run a makes going to be this is

[1:33:24.760 --> 1:33:29.960]  to get your take on the importance of this he's saying that if action is not
[1:33:29.960 --> 1:33:33.080]  taking that he's going to stand before the house for eight hours and introduce
[1:33:33.080 --> 1:33:36.920]  60 articles of impeachment I was wondering if you actually saw the 35
[1:33:36.920 --> 1:33:42.640]  articles watched any of this and what you felt about it I guess I watched some
[1:33:42.640 --> 1:33:48.560]  of it I did read the transcript and the articles I think that Kucinich is an
[1:33:48.560 --> 1:33:54.760]  American hero he's almost the only member of Congress I guess we could count
[1:33:54.760 --> 1:34:06.160]  Ron Paul and what's so frustrating and disturbing is the cowardice of the
[1:34:06.160 --> 1:34:14.600]  Democratic Party to act I mean we've never had such a criminal regime ever I
[1:34:14.600 --> 1:34:20.760]  mean these these Republican brown shirts they they write with the worst that
[1:34:20.760 --> 1:34:25.600]  the world has ever seen they're they're war criminals they're liars they're
[1:34:25.600 --> 1:34:32.400]  schemers they they have violated statutory law the Constitution they have
[1:34:32.400 --> 1:34:39.000]  no respect for public opinion or for treaties or for the power of Congress in
[1:34:39.000 --> 1:34:45.040]  the court so why they're not impeached it's just an amazing thing if you can
[1:34:45.040 --> 1:34:52.440]  impeach Nixon for or you know force him out by threatening impeachment
[1:34:52.440 --> 1:34:58.120]  Nixon who all he did was lie about when he learned about a burglary that had
[1:34:58.120 --> 1:35:07.000]  he had no role in Clinton for a bit of hanky-panky in the Oval Office how come
[1:35:07.000 --> 1:35:13.280]  Bush can get away with these things why is it that it's only Kucinich who sees
[1:35:13.280 --> 1:35:18.640]  what's at stake you if we let these people get away with this then we are
[1:35:18.640 --> 1:35:24.480]  forever altered all the kinds of it's like Caesar crossing the Rubicon I mean
[1:35:24.480 --> 1:35:29.280]  the whole structure of Roman government was henceforth different for all times
[1:35:29.280 --> 1:35:35.200]  and it just gradually fell into more and more tyranny and that's what happens
[1:35:35.200 --> 1:35:41.200]  when you don't hold your government accountable so I think that your
[1:35:41.200 --> 1:35:50.840]  Senators is a hero and I'm I think that in a way he's basically dramatizing the
[1:35:50.840 --> 1:35:56.920]  collapse of American liberty the fact that nothing is being done to hold a
[1:35:56.920 --> 1:36:01.140]  criminal regime accountable one of my greatest fears is if we don't hold them
[1:36:01.140 --> 1:36:04.440]  accountable especially from within a lot of people talk about international
[1:36:04.440 --> 1:36:07.840]  tribunals I think that's not the way to go if we don't do this from within
[1:36:07.840 --> 1:36:11.200]  restore our Bill of Rights and Constitution I fear like we're going to
[1:36:11.200 --> 1:36:15.600]  go down in history as the next Nazi regime throughout the world and that
[1:36:15.600 --> 1:36:20.040]  really scares me because most people just aren't awake to any of this they
[1:36:20.040 --> 1:36:23.640]  don't read they watch tabloid journalism they care about you know
[1:36:23.640 --> 1:36:29.600]  Britney Spears Paris Hill and all this nonsense and serious geopolitical
[1:36:29.600 --> 1:36:33.280]  ramifications are going to happen for this country you know if this kind of
[1:36:33.280 --> 1:36:37.640]  thing continues I mean I don't know if you saw the news over the weekend that
[1:36:37.640 --> 1:36:43.200]  this prison in Afghanistan had been attacked a thousand militants supposedly
[1:36:43.200 --> 1:36:48.600]  escaped 400 of them Taliban by Monday CNN is reporting that you know the Taliban
[1:36:48.600 --> 1:36:52.760]  has a new stronghold in Afghanistan and we're gonna be there forever and then
[1:36:52.760 --> 1:36:57.360]  later in on Monday it's coming out that the US had a role in this Afghan prison
[1:36:57.360 --> 1:37:02.400]  attack to let these people go so I feel like we're bogging ourselves down there
[1:37:02.400 --> 1:37:06.440]  we're never going to leave you know Obama says he's changed that we can vote
[1:37:06.440 --> 1:37:10.640]  for but do you really believe that he's going to bring the troops back and who
[1:37:10.640 --> 1:37:14.520]  do you think he's gonna select as his running mate I don't know who he would
[1:37:14.520 --> 1:37:19.200]  select his running mate you know be wonderful if he would do something you
[1:37:19.200 --> 1:37:24.760]  know innovative I mean what if he chose Ron Paul or or that Republican senator
[1:37:24.760 --> 1:37:29.360]  from the Midwest who's resigned as opposed to the war and is resigning what's
[1:37:29.360 --> 1:37:34.520]  his name man which one I'm not quite sure people keep trying to say Hagle but
[1:37:34.520 --> 1:37:41.240]  it's not Hagle no how do you feel about that the meeting he had with Hillary I
[1:37:41.240 --> 1:37:44.920]  mean I don't know if you've seen the video this either but the entire press
[1:37:44.920 --> 1:37:49.200]  corps gets on a plane they think he's going back to Chicago but really he's
[1:37:49.200 --> 1:37:53.400]  meeting with Hillary somewhere in northern Virginia and they're all asking
[1:37:53.400 --> 1:37:58.280]  questions about it and this guy's his press guy saying well he wanted to have
[1:37:58.280 --> 1:38:01.720]  some meetings with some people you know several meetings in private and this
[1:38:01.720 --> 1:38:06.440]  just happens to be in the same place at the same time that Bilderberg rolls in
[1:38:06.440 --> 1:38:11.800]  you know with people like Condoleezza writes Paul Wolfowitz is there Bernacke
[1:38:11.800 --> 1:38:15.800]  of course Rockefeller the heads of Google all these all these heads of
[1:38:15.800 --> 1:38:20.240]  industry and politics and I can't help but think that you know they met
[1:38:20.240 --> 1:38:24.200]  together and they probably met with some of these people as well well it
[1:38:24.200 --> 1:38:31.200]  wouldn't matter you know I think all of us focus on these groups like Bilder
[1:38:31.200 --> 1:38:37.720]  burger and trial lateral and counsel farm relations and the Davos group I
[1:38:37.720 --> 1:38:41.200]  mean there's just so many groups and I'm sure some of them have some influence
[1:38:41.200 --> 1:38:46.240]  but they don't have anything like the influence of the establishments of the
[1:38:46.240 --> 1:38:52.840]  two political parties here or the influence of the Israel army or for
[1:38:52.840 --> 1:38:57.960]  that matter of Wall Street over the economy so I the threat to us is I
[1:38:57.960 --> 1:39:02.360]  think we're Alex Jones who does an enormous amount of important work
[1:39:02.360 --> 1:39:08.080]  where it goes wrong is emphasizing so much these extraneous outside groups
[1:39:08.080 --> 1:39:13.200]  the danger is in Washington in the two political establishments they're the
[1:39:13.200 --> 1:39:18.120]  ones who can take away our civil liberties who who have the power to tax
[1:39:18.120 --> 1:39:22.480]  and go to war and all that stuff so that's where the problem is I think if
[1:39:22.480 --> 1:39:29.280]  Obama meets with Hillary he's probably trying to feel them out and see can he
[1:39:29.280 --> 1:39:34.080]  still have their support in the election without choosing her as his
[1:39:34.080 --> 1:39:39.280]  running mate this is always the problem in American politics when you beat
[1:39:39.280 --> 1:39:46.520]  somebody there's tremendous pressure on you to take them as your as you're
[1:39:46.520 --> 1:39:51.120]  running mate you know on Ronald Reagan he had to take George Bush you see what
[1:39:51.120 --> 1:39:55.040]  I'm saying no I know and that was something he did not want to do he but
[1:39:55.040 --> 1:39:59.080]  they told him well don't you remember go war to go war to beat Rockefeller he
[1:39:59.080 --> 1:40:04.120]  didn't take Rockefeller and they destroyed him the Republicans turned on
[1:40:04.120 --> 1:40:10.160]  him and and so I think Obama is worried about all the angry women because
[1:40:10.160 --> 1:40:16.640]  Hillary lost and the women for Hillary and he wants to get their support and
[1:40:16.640 --> 1:40:21.200]  Hillary's probably saying well you know I don't know what she's saying whether
[1:40:21.200 --> 1:40:25.960]  she's saying she wants to be on the court or she wants to be vice president or
[1:40:25.960 --> 1:40:33.520]  she wants her bills paid off or but some deal is being made and that's normal
[1:40:33.520 --> 1:40:42.040]  and natural I don't think Hillary would help Obama I think all the people
[1:40:42.040 --> 1:40:46.680]  that are against her simply wouldn't vote for him I doubt they'd vote for
[1:40:46.680 --> 1:40:54.360]  McCain either so I think it would cost him a lot of votes probably as many if
[1:40:54.360 --> 1:41:00.000]  not more than he would gain from the angry women who won't Hillary but those
[1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:04.040]  are political decisions he'll listen to all kinds of advisors who will have
[1:41:04.040 --> 1:41:11.480]  different views and and if they make the right decision it'll be a miracle it's
[1:41:11.480 --> 1:41:14.880]  well I don't think they're gonna make the right decision I've always said that
[1:41:14.880 --> 1:41:18.560]  it'll probably be even before you know Obama was the candidate of Hillary Obama
[1:41:18.560 --> 1:41:22.040]  or Obama Hillary ticket but then if they didn't choose one of those I was
[1:41:22.040 --> 1:41:26.280]  thinking Edwards is really the establishment guy he's the guy they've
[1:41:26.280 --> 1:41:29.880]  put forth before you know he's a good-looking southerner can relate to
[1:41:29.880 --> 1:41:33.920]  people came people seem to like him as the runner-up who knows I could be wrong
[1:41:33.920 --> 1:41:38.680]  but I see it either as Hillary or Edwards I really don't see much of a change
[1:41:38.680 --> 1:41:42.800]  with this coming administration I mean do you feel like this administration
[1:41:42.800 --> 1:41:46.160]  coming in say say Obama does get elected will he get us out of out of the
[1:41:46.160 --> 1:41:53.240]  Middle East I don't know it's hard because of the Israel lobby it's like
[1:41:53.240 --> 1:41:57.640]  it's like Admiral Morrow said those years ago that no American president can
[1:41:57.640 --> 1:42:04.960]  stand up to Israel but I do you know as I said earlier now talk Jason yeah real
[1:42:04.960 --> 1:42:10.440]  concern is that the Republicans have morphed into a brown shirt party they
[1:42:10.440 --> 1:42:17.520]  are committed to tyranny in America tyranny meaning executive power Ubalis
[1:42:17.520 --> 1:42:24.600]  that the president is the final and supreme power and the other powers are
[1:42:24.600 --> 1:42:30.360]  somehow something to be negotiated with occasionally but not taken too seriously
[1:42:30.360 --> 1:42:37.480]  and so this is what's at stake it's more important than the war or the oil
[1:42:37.480 --> 1:42:44.340]  companies or even than the destruction of the American economy because if we
[1:42:44.340 --> 1:42:48.880]  destroy liberty then we're gone forever there's no there's no comeback and I
[1:42:48.880 --> 1:42:52.840]  think that's what the Republicans are doing you know the Federalist Society
[1:42:52.840 --> 1:42:58.760]  Republican lawyers from which come all the Republican court nominees all
[1:42:58.760 --> 1:43:05.240]  the Justice Department nominees all the staffers to the Judiciary Committees for
[1:43:05.240 --> 1:43:10.280]  the Republicans these people are committed to elevating the power of the
[1:43:10.280 --> 1:43:16.200]  presidency beyond the office that's spelled out in the Constitution so they
[1:43:16.200 --> 1:43:25.120]  are a threat in a way that goes beyond Iraq or Iran or Israel or the oil
[1:43:25.120 --> 1:43:30.480]  companies or or anything else so that is where I think we have to well I feel
[1:43:30.480 --> 1:43:34.920]  like folks I don't think Obama is anything like that or that the Democrats
[1:43:34.920 --> 1:43:41.960]  are so I think we're safer with retaining liberty with Obama and the
[1:43:41.960 --> 1:43:47.880]  Democrats and that that should be our primary concern I'd love to see Obama
[1:43:47.880 --> 1:43:53.440]  do something really innovative and go choose Ron Paul or choose somebody that
[1:43:53.440 --> 1:44:00.000]  would throw some confusion I mean I would take a few candidates I mean
[1:44:00.000 --> 1:44:03.960]  Dennis Kasinich I know Cynthia McKinney is running as the Green Party but I like
[1:44:03.960 --> 1:44:07.360]  her obviously Ron Paul Ron Paul just started campaign for liberty which is
[1:44:07.360 --> 1:44:11.760]  supposedly going to be focusing on getting people into local government and
[1:44:11.760 --> 1:44:17.080]  to run for Congress Bob Bar not Bob Bar's not bad I'll agree with you that would
[1:44:17.080 --> 1:44:22.360]  be a that would be a great thing it would just sort of show that he's breaking
[1:44:22.360 --> 1:44:29.440]  he's trying to break the mole of the two-party control well I gotta tell you
[1:44:29.440 --> 1:44:33.200]  and you know you were talking about how the Republicans have really put the
[1:44:33.200 --> 1:44:36.360]  president above the law and I feel like that's been done with the Patriot Acts
[1:44:36.360 --> 1:44:40.800]  one and two parts of three but really with the Military Commissions Act but
[1:44:40.800 --> 1:44:45.560]  we did just have a Supreme Court ruling that said that habeas corpus does exist
[1:44:45.560 --> 1:44:50.160]  it was a five to four vote and McCain was like disgusted with the ruling people
[1:44:50.160 --> 1:44:53.360]  like new new gang rich came out and said now we're gonna have to lose an
[1:44:53.360 --> 1:44:57.000]  American city and that's you know it's terrible but that's the only way that
[1:44:57.000 --> 1:45:00.440]  this is gonna pass and I feel like they've already done it I just don't
[1:45:00.440 --> 1:45:04.040]  know if I trust that Obama is gonna rescind those type of things and get
[1:45:04.040 --> 1:45:09.360]  rid of you know matter if you trust him or not do that but if you get McCain
[1:45:09.360 --> 1:45:15.000]  you're gonna get the fifth Republican on the Supreme Court and then the rulings
[1:45:15.000 --> 1:45:18.360]  we're gonna go the other way so you're just saying just more terrible
[1:45:18.360 --> 1:45:22.800]  legislation will be passed that's even more incomprehensible than I don't know
[1:45:22.800 --> 1:45:29.000]  I don't think so I think that the Democrats were are much more likely to
[1:45:29.000 --> 1:45:34.960]  take civil liberties seriously and to and to provide a defense of them they
[1:45:34.960 --> 1:45:41.880]  always have they have always and the Republicans as I said earlier simply
[1:45:41.880 --> 1:45:48.640]  regard civil liberties as coddling devices for bad people somehow it lets
[1:45:48.640 --> 1:45:52.520]  the bad people get away we think let's terrorists get away let's criminals get
[1:45:52.520 --> 1:46:02.160]  away so that is their mindset and that is the danger to liberty for all the
[1:46:02.160 --> 1:46:09.600]  failings of the Democrats and all the corruptions and cowardice I think we
[1:46:09.600 --> 1:46:15.160]  could count on them on the civil liberty front particularly if it's their
[1:46:15.160 --> 1:46:21.240]  president I mean they're likely to be a majority in the Congress as well and I
[1:46:21.240 --> 1:46:27.240]  think you would see pressures to repeal some of Bush's executive orders and
[1:46:27.240 --> 1:46:33.560]  and presidential directors because they are tyrannical and there's no reason for
[1:46:33.560 --> 1:46:38.120]  them so I think you would see you know most of the civil liberties groups are
[1:46:38.120 --> 1:46:45.280]  democratic in fact all of them are and I just think they would be pushing hard
[1:46:45.280 --> 1:46:50.720]  on that they would lobby for that that's part of the constituency why don't you
[1:46:50.720 --> 1:46:55.640]  shoot out the website where they can find all this information which way which
[1:46:55.640 --> 1:47:01.040]  your website oh my listen I don't have a website but I recently wrote about this
[1:47:01.040 --> 1:47:04.680]  subject that we're talking about and it was on counterpunch the other day or
[1:47:04.680 --> 1:47:11.400]  information clearing house or op-ed news I do read a lot of your pieces I mean
[1:47:11.400 --> 1:47:15.480]  they are interesting stuff and obviously you're an insider for many years back I
[1:47:15.480 --> 1:47:19.320]  I just feel like you're too optimistic with the with the Democrats just like
[1:47:19.320 --> 1:47:23.160]  you said I mean Cassinage goes on you know the house floor for over three
[1:47:23.160 --> 1:47:29.080]  hours lays out a total criminal case against this administration from start
[1:47:29.080 --> 1:47:35.040]  to finish and I think I read that 24 Republicans had backed it and I don't
[1:47:35.040 --> 1:47:39.200]  know how many Democrats and I just feel like where are these people you know
[1:47:39.200 --> 1:47:45.200]  where we're are like Jason you're too young to know and you haven't served in
[1:47:45.200 --> 1:47:48.200]  Washington but what they're doing is making political calculations and they're
[1:47:48.200 --> 1:47:55.760]  saying look Bush is finished he's on his way out we're rid of him anyhow and we
[1:47:55.760 --> 1:48:02.320]  start all this we don't know how the neocon press is gonna play it we don't
[1:48:02.320 --> 1:48:07.280]  know where the American people are gonna feel like we're attacking a wartime
[1:48:07.280 --> 1:48:16.680]  president and are somehow being unpatriotic and giving comfort to to
[1:48:16.680 --> 1:48:22.200]  Al Cato or Iran or whoever they're worried about so there the Democrats are
[1:48:22.200 --> 1:48:30.480]  just playing it safe they're saying we want to win the cost of us of impeding
[1:48:30.480 --> 1:48:37.640]  him may be too high since we're rid of him anyhow and once we're rid of him we
[1:48:37.640 --> 1:48:43.720]  can still hold investigations and ask about these things and put out reports
[1:48:43.720 --> 1:48:50.800]  and just slowly damn him and damn him and damning until he's really had a worse
[1:48:50.800 --> 1:48:57.120]  treatment than impeachment so I would imagine that that's what's in their mind
[1:48:57.120 --> 1:49:05.960]  that they they're simply saying they're overvaluing them winning the election
[1:49:05.960 --> 1:49:13.320]  and undervaluing the public perception worldwide of them holding Bush
[1:49:13.320 --> 1:49:18.400]  accountable and saying we won't stand for this this is a breach of our system
[1:49:18.400 --> 1:49:24.760]  and you're paying the price so I think I agree with you that they should value
[1:49:24.760 --> 1:49:31.360]  that more and their chances less on the other hand if they lose the election
[1:49:31.360 --> 1:49:37.360]  from going after a wartime president making Americans think that they have
[1:49:37.360 --> 1:49:42.720]  sympathies with terrorists and all that stuff you know what all Fox News and
[1:49:42.720 --> 1:49:46.600]  everybody'll say they'll say this is these Democrats are in league with Ben
[1:49:46.600 --> 1:49:51.760]  Lawton that's what you hear every day of all day long home from Hannity O'Reilly
[1:49:51.760 --> 1:49:55.720]  well she's making one last charge to try to get Ben Lawton apparently before
[1:49:55.720 --> 1:49:58.920]  his presidency they won't matter if they get him or not he's irrelevant at this
[1:49:58.920 --> 1:50:05.960]  point a propaganda it'll help them maybe but so I think the Democrats saying you
[1:50:05.960 --> 1:50:11.760]  know if they get back in who is it that's so old on the court now Stevens
[1:50:11.760 --> 1:50:17.280]  isn't it yeah I think so yeah so okay so then they come up with another Federalist
[1:50:17.280 --> 1:50:25.280]  Society member and then they have a majority then when when they set up
[1:50:25.280 --> 1:50:28.880]  that habeas corpus the court upholds them and then the whole thing is over so
[1:50:28.880 --> 1:50:32.960]  the stakes are very high Jason I agree Dr. Paul Craig Roberts thank you so much

[1:53:49.880 --> 1:53:55.080]  me
[1:53:55.080 --> 1:54:24.460]  All right folks, we're back at the Alex Jones show.
[1:54:24.460 --> 1:54:30.320]  I got to tell you, I disagree just a little bit.
[1:54:30.320 --> 1:54:34.240]  I mean, I really, you know, I listen to him a lot and I read a lot of his counter punch
[1:54:34.240 --> 1:54:37.640]  stuff and I just don't think the Democrats are going to be that good for us.
[1:54:37.640 --> 1:54:40.680]  I think it's always a soft hearing, which I guess might be a little better.
[1:54:40.680 --> 1:54:45.100]  I mean, Clinton definitely had me fooled while he was in office at least.
[1:54:45.100 --> 1:54:49.040]  But I don't know if I want that somebody, you know, who's slicker, who's not going
[1:54:49.040 --> 1:54:52.760]  to let all these, you know, terrible things come out.
[1:54:52.760 --> 1:54:53.760]  Maybe that's just me.
[1:54:53.760 --> 1:54:57.360]  I kind of like having, you know, somebody who's so transparent as Bush.
[1:54:57.360 --> 1:54:59.280]  We all know Bush doesn't run the country.
[1:54:59.280 --> 1:55:02.640]  I mean, I wish we had talked about that, but I'm sure we agree that, you know, it's
[1:55:02.640 --> 1:55:03.880]  more of his administration.
[1:55:03.880 --> 1:55:04.880]  He's just a puppet front.
[1:55:04.880 --> 1:55:05.880]  All right.
[1:55:05.880 --> 1:55:07.040]  Let's start shooting through some calls.
[1:55:07.040 --> 1:55:08.200]  Let's take Charles and Louisiana.
[1:55:08.200 --> 1:55:09.200]  Charles, are you with us?
[1:55:09.200 --> 1:55:10.200]  How you doing?
[1:55:10.200 --> 1:55:11.200]  Good, man.
[1:55:11.200 --> 1:55:12.200]  How you doing?
[1:55:12.200 --> 1:55:13.200]  Fine.
[1:55:13.200 --> 1:55:16.840]  Listen, that guy there, that's part of the trouble, a Democrat, Republican.
[1:55:16.840 --> 1:55:20.560]  You can't take a system to fix it, if it's broke to fix it.
[1:55:20.560 --> 1:55:22.000]  Democrat and Republicans the same way.
[1:55:22.000 --> 1:55:25.840]  I don't know where he's coming from, but he confuses things.
[1:55:25.840 --> 1:55:28.440]  But anyway, I want to thank you for what you're doing.
[1:55:28.440 --> 1:55:34.280]  And I want to say this, just a few people, they're willing to spread the truth.
[1:55:34.280 --> 1:55:39.360]  I used to blame the politicians for all our mistakes and our misery and detris, but it's
[1:55:39.360 --> 1:55:41.280]  not the politicians fault.
[1:55:41.280 --> 1:55:43.840]  It's the American people's fault.
[1:55:43.840 --> 1:55:44.840]  You know what I mean?
[1:55:44.840 --> 1:55:48.400]  Well, obviously, you know, there are some that believe that we get the government we
[1:55:48.400 --> 1:55:51.920]  deserve and there is an element that it is our fault.
[1:55:51.920 --> 1:55:57.160]  We have become, you know, fluoridated zombies that only care about, you know, our beer,
[1:55:57.160 --> 1:55:59.360]  our car, our home, and our sports team.
[1:55:59.360 --> 1:56:00.360]  Maybe our kids sometimes.
[1:56:00.360 --> 1:56:09.160]  Our kids raised them, the little girls, almost like, well, really, they're crampy, nine years
[1:56:09.160 --> 1:56:10.160]  old.
[1:56:10.160 --> 1:56:12.560]  The boys are usually on Prozac.
[1:56:12.560 --> 1:56:17.920]  The old man, he loves to look at a guy running 66 with a ball, football, and beer.
[1:56:17.920 --> 1:56:19.600]  I mean, that's what America's about.
[1:56:19.600 --> 1:56:22.360]  And America, these people are toast.
[1:56:22.360 --> 1:56:23.360]  They toast.
[1:56:23.360 --> 1:56:26.960]  And they haven't seen the bad side of life yet.
[1:56:26.960 --> 1:56:30.680]  They're not going to get out and give these tapes out, so they're too proud.
[1:56:30.680 --> 1:56:31.920]  They're too proud.
[1:56:31.920 --> 1:56:36.960]  I hope that that pride goes away, because you know what, you know, being one of the guys
[1:56:36.960 --> 1:56:38.520]  that created the loose change, I've seen it.
[1:56:38.520 --> 1:56:39.520]  I've seen people hand out.
[1:56:39.520 --> 1:56:42.120]  It's one of my favorite tapes I gave out.
[1:56:42.120 --> 1:56:43.120]  Oh, thank you.
[1:56:43.120 --> 1:56:44.120]  Exactly.
[1:56:44.120 --> 1:56:45.120]  And you did that.
[1:56:45.120 --> 1:56:46.120]  I gave 1100 copies.
[1:56:46.120 --> 1:56:47.120]  Exactly.
[1:56:47.120 --> 1:56:52.400]  And I do believe that we can make the difference, we can wake people up, and it won't be everybody,
[1:56:52.400 --> 1:56:53.400]  Charles.
[1:56:53.400 --> 1:56:56.080]  Yeah, but the American people, let me explain something to you.
[1:56:56.080 --> 1:57:02.440]  They, this is like the people on Idaho, when pain hits them, they want to do something.
[1:57:02.440 --> 1:57:05.840]  But here's two solutions to the problem, and there's two problems.
[1:57:05.840 --> 1:57:10.280]  We took God out of school, out of the courtroom, and we want God to defend us, but we won't
[1:57:10.280 --> 1:57:11.280]  defend God.
[1:57:11.280 --> 1:57:15.760]  And if we don't do it with God, you've got to do it with a gun like our forefather said.
[1:57:15.760 --> 1:57:19.280]  And the American people ain't got the guts to stand up for God, they ain't got the guts
[1:57:19.280 --> 1:57:22.600]  to stand up for their country, they don't have the guts to stand up for their self.
[1:57:22.600 --> 1:57:28.480]  I was in New Orleans for Katrina, and if you would have seen the disgust, the soldiers,
[1:57:28.480 --> 1:57:32.640]  I lost respect for our soldiers, so bad, it made me sick in my stomach.
[1:57:32.640 --> 1:57:34.880]  I actually puked the next day thinking about it.
[1:57:34.880 --> 1:57:38.560]  What they did to these women was thirsty.
[1:57:38.560 --> 1:57:45.720]  The soldiers that we supposed to respect, the one in Iraq and all that, they are animals,
[1:57:45.720 --> 1:57:48.480]  they are animals, they believe that.
[1:57:48.480 --> 1:57:51.320]  Some of them have gotten out of hand, and yeah, we should show that picture.
[1:57:51.320 --> 1:57:57.120]  Oh listen, they had a cop there, put a woman over and got back at a corner right up here.
[1:57:57.120 --> 1:57:59.440]  Well, that's a horrible story, Charles.
[1:57:59.440 --> 1:58:02.720]  Yeah, what it is, but you don't hear anybody say anything about it.
[1:58:02.720 --> 1:58:03.720]  No, well, you know what?
[1:58:03.720 --> 1:58:08.600]  I would point you towards Spike Lee's documentary, it's pretty hardcore, when the levees broke,
[1:58:08.600 --> 1:58:09.600]  it's four parts.
[1:58:09.600 --> 1:58:10.600]  Thank you for the call, Charles.
[1:58:10.600 --> 1:58:11.600]  We're going to take other calls.
[1:58:11.600 --> 1:58:13.160]  On the other side, it's the Alex Jones show.
[1:58:13.160 --> 1:58:17.040]  I am Jason Bermas, infowars.com, prisonplanet.com.
[1:58:55.360 --> 1:58:58.720]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[1:58:58.720 --> 1:59:03.720]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating
[1:59:03.720 --> 1:59:09.080]  80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:59:09.080 --> 1:59:14.560]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[1:59:14.560 --> 1:59:18.360]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[1:59:18.360 --> 1:59:21.120]  Littleberg is making great progress toward the world, doesn't it?
[1:59:21.120 --> 1:59:24.280]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money, they have all the money they need,
[1:59:24.280 --> 1:59:25.280]  they're after power.
[1:59:25.280 --> 1:59:26.280]  That's their happenings.

[1:59:38.880 --> 1:59:54.880]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:59:54.880 --> 1:59:55.880]  Government cover-ups.
[1:59:55.880 --> 1:59:56.880]  You want answers?
[1:59:56.880 --> 1:59:58.880]  Well, so does he.
[1:59:58.880 --> 2:00:03.640]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:03.640 --> 2:00:09.520]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:09.520 --> 2:00:14.200]  Alright folks, we are back at the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:14.200 --> 2:00:18.560]  And I want to remind everybody that it's our sponsors that make this show possible.
[2:00:18.560 --> 2:00:22.600]  New Vitality's Aloe's, with all the junk we eat, it's important that we do our very
[2:00:22.600 --> 2:00:24.720]  best to take care of our digestive system.
[2:00:24.720 --> 2:00:28.280]  New Vitality, one of our great sponsors, has a product called Aloe's.
[2:00:28.280 --> 2:00:32.680]  Aloe's is an herbal dietary supplement developed to support healthy digestive function and
[2:00:32.680 --> 2:00:34.440]  even helps maintain weight loss.
[2:00:34.440 --> 2:00:38.440]  Aloe's is all-natural ingredients, nutritionally support regularity, and assist your body
[2:00:38.440 --> 2:00:41.440]  in removing acclimated waste.
[2:00:41.440 --> 2:00:45.520]  It contains 30 synergistically balanced natural herbs and enzymes that work together to improve
[2:00:45.520 --> 2:00:46.520]  overall health.
[2:00:46.520 --> 2:00:50.880]  Do yourself a favor and click on the big banner over at infowars.com or give them a call at
[2:00:50.880 --> 2:01:00.880]  1-800-569-4056, that's 1-800-569-4056, and we're going to continue to take your calls
[2:01:00.880 --> 2:01:03.080]  that call from Charles was rough.
[2:01:03.080 --> 2:01:05.200]  And I know Charles is a long-time listener.
[2:01:05.200 --> 2:01:10.800]  I've heard him many a time on the show and you know, I want to think the best of my soldiers
[2:01:10.800 --> 2:01:14.640]  most of the time, but I know people are people, man.
[2:01:14.640 --> 2:01:16.760]  And unfortunately, sometimes people aren't the greatest.
[2:01:16.760 --> 2:01:19.720]  We all have the capacity for good and evil.
[2:01:19.720 --> 2:01:22.320]  Let's go to the person who disagrees, he goes to the head of line.
[2:01:22.320 --> 2:01:23.320]  Let's go to Scott in Arizona.
[2:01:23.320 --> 2:01:24.320]  Scott, what's up?
[2:01:24.320 --> 2:01:25.320]  Hey, Jason.
[2:01:25.320 --> 2:01:29.920]  I'm a long-time listener of Alex Jones as well.
[2:01:29.920 --> 2:01:35.040]  I was just listening to Dr. Craig Roberts and I agree with him on an issue and the issue
[2:01:35.040 --> 2:01:38.480]  I believe is that Dennis Kistenich is in the firing pan right now.
[2:01:38.480 --> 2:01:41.760]  He's the only one in there sticking up for our civil liberties.
[2:01:41.760 --> 2:01:46.320]  I think that the movement should stand behind him, since we actually have a congressman
[2:01:46.320 --> 2:01:49.640]  in there sticking up for our country and our rights.
[2:01:49.640 --> 2:01:54.600]  And I think we should be backing him, at least the people side of it, and then the
[2:01:54.600 --> 2:01:55.600]  news will pick up on it.
[2:01:55.600 --> 2:01:58.360]  Well, I don't know if the news is going to pick up on it, man.
[2:01:58.360 --> 2:02:00.080]  I think we are, man.
[2:02:00.080 --> 2:02:02.520]  How much we do it?
[2:02:02.520 --> 2:02:06.480]  I want to believe that, man, but jeez, they just black out so much.
[2:02:06.480 --> 2:02:08.680]  They've blacked out this dice thing.
[2:02:08.680 --> 2:02:13.360]  They didn't report on Kistenich till the day after and they barely did.
[2:02:13.360 --> 2:02:17.640]  I'm not seeing anybody discussing it on any of these political arena talk shows.
[2:02:17.640 --> 2:02:18.640]  What's it going to take?
[2:02:18.640 --> 2:02:19.640]  I mean, what are we going to do?
[2:02:19.640 --> 2:02:21.280]  Get 500 people outside the Capitol building?
[2:02:21.280 --> 2:02:22.280]  I mean, you tell me.
[2:02:22.280 --> 2:02:26.080]  I mean, you've got to move when you have your shot.
[2:02:26.080 --> 2:02:30.200]  And right now we have a real true shot at it, and we've got a guy in there that's actually
[2:02:30.200 --> 2:02:31.200]  going after him.
[2:02:31.200 --> 2:02:33.320]  You know, we need to support him on those issues.
[2:02:33.320 --> 2:02:35.560]  We don't have to support the Democratic Party.
[2:02:35.560 --> 2:02:39.080]  We need to support him on those issues, because he's fighting for our civil liberties.
[2:02:39.080 --> 2:02:40.480]  Well, I'm with you there.
[2:02:40.480 --> 2:02:41.480]  I'm with you 100% there.
[2:02:41.480 --> 2:02:46.400]  I mean, like you said, if they don't take action, he's going to do 60 articles of impeachment,
[2:02:46.400 --> 2:02:47.840]  and I think that's what we wait for.
[2:02:47.840 --> 2:02:52.120]  I mean, you know, I hate to wait more, but if they don't do anything with this legislation,
[2:02:52.120 --> 2:02:56.560]  I would love to see him stand on the House floor for eight hours and go through 60 articles
[2:02:56.560 --> 2:02:57.560]  of impeachment.
[2:02:57.560 --> 2:02:59.360]  I mean, I don't know what it's going to take to wake people up.
[2:02:59.360 --> 2:03:01.640]  I was on this as soon as someone told me.
[2:03:01.640 --> 2:03:02.640]  I taped it.
[2:03:02.640 --> 2:03:04.200]  Obviously, we got him on the radio.
[2:03:04.200 --> 2:03:05.480]  I think people should support him.
[2:03:05.480 --> 2:03:09.200]  I think they should call their congressman, their representative in their district, and
[2:03:09.200 --> 2:03:10.880]  tell them to support Mr. Kucinich.
[2:03:10.880 --> 2:03:11.880]  I'm all for that.
[2:03:11.880 --> 2:03:14.920]  Maybe you should, you know, create a website, a quick one, you know?
[2:03:14.920 --> 2:03:15.920]  Yeah.
[2:03:15.920 --> 2:03:18.440]  I mean, after hearing him talk, I thought he was right on the money with that.
[2:03:18.440 --> 2:03:23.760]  At least now part of it, because if we get in there and start supporting him and he starts
[2:03:23.760 --> 2:03:27.960]  to feel that he's got some backing from the American people, it'll make a huge difference
[2:03:27.960 --> 2:03:31.880]  and might pick up like the Ron Paul thing, because we actually got another congressman
[2:03:31.880 --> 2:03:36.640]  in there going against, you know, the institution, and I think that's a major plus, right?
[2:03:36.640 --> 2:03:37.640]  I'm with you, Scott.
[2:03:37.640 --> 2:03:38.640]  Thank you for the call.
[2:03:38.640 --> 2:03:41.600]  And I'd just like to point out that Kucinich said on several occasions he would love to
[2:03:41.600 --> 2:03:43.960]  run with Ron Paul, you know?
[2:03:43.960 --> 2:03:47.480]  They're buddies down there, and they know a lot of what's going on.
[2:03:47.480 --> 2:03:49.800]  All right, let's go to Lance in Missouri.
[2:03:49.800 --> 2:03:50.800]  Lance, are you with us?
[2:03:50.800 --> 2:03:51.800]  Yes, I am.
[2:03:51.800 --> 2:03:52.800]  How are you doing, Jason?
[2:03:52.800 --> 2:03:53.800]  Good, man.
[2:03:53.800 --> 2:03:54.800]  I had a good job this week.
[2:03:54.800 --> 2:03:55.800]  Awesome.
[2:03:55.800 --> 2:03:56.800]  Thanks.
[2:03:56.800 --> 2:03:58.560]  I wanted to disagree with what Paul Craig Roberts had to say.
[2:03:58.560 --> 2:04:02.320]  I don't believe Barack Obama is a very good choice at all.
[2:04:02.320 --> 2:04:06.840]  You know, one thing is his coziness with Sabignou Brzezinski.
[2:04:06.840 --> 2:04:07.840]  That's a big thing right there.
[2:04:07.840 --> 2:04:08.840]  And you know what?
[2:04:08.840 --> 2:04:12.880]  I don't think that he's promoting him, say, but he really just thinks that Republicans
[2:04:12.880 --> 2:04:14.800]  are just so evil, in which they are.
[2:04:14.800 --> 2:04:16.160]  A lot of them are.
[2:04:16.160 --> 2:04:18.880]  But he just, I don't know, he can't get around it, man.
[2:04:18.880 --> 2:04:19.880]  We're going to hold you over.
[2:04:19.880 --> 2:04:20.880]  Yeah, I'm with you.
[2:04:20.880 --> 2:04:24.560]  Not only is he cozyed up to Zignou, but I think there's more going on at that Bilderberg
[2:04:24.560 --> 2:04:27.320]  meeting than Paul Craig Roberts knows about.
[2:04:27.320 --> 2:04:31.800]  And on top of that, look, Jim Johnson was there, and he was the guy who was supposed
[2:04:31.800 --> 2:04:32.800]  to choose his running mate.
[2:04:32.800 --> 2:04:33.800]  We'll be back after this.
[2:04:33.800 --> 2:04:47.480]  That's the Alex Jones show.
[2:04:47.480 --> 2:04:52.680]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror, loose change, final cut, in-game blueprint
[2:04:52.680 --> 2:04:57.680]  for global enslavement, the true story of the Bilderberg group, the late-rate USA, America,
[2:04:57.680 --> 2:04:59.160]  freedom to fascism.
[2:04:59.160 --> 2:05:03.320]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at Truth

[2:05:47.080 --> 2:05:51.200]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that
[2:05:51.200 --> 2:05:55.200]  you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking
[2:05:55.200 --> 2:05:56.200]  the water?
[2:05:56.200 --> 2:06:00.080]  Yes, because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into
[2:06:00.080 --> 2:06:01.080]  the skin.
[2:06:01.080 --> 2:06:05.720]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to
[2:06:05.720 --> 2:06:11.160]  reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold,
[2:06:11.160 --> 2:06:12.560]  algae, and fungus.
[2:06:12.560 --> 2:06:17.400]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons, or one year whichever
[2:06:17.400 --> 2:06:18.400]  comes first.
[2:06:18.400 --> 2:06:22.600]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine,
[2:06:22.600 --> 2:06:24.680]  iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[2:06:24.680 --> 2:06:25.680]  What about you?

[2:06:45.520 --> 2:06:50.200]  Hello, this is Tom with HempUSA.org.
[2:06:50.200 --> 2:06:54.240]  Most of you have been hearing my ads for the past few months, and it's no secret that
[2:06:54.240 --> 2:06:57.760]  the economy is failing and prices are rising in all sectors.
[2:06:57.760 --> 2:07:01.960]  If you've been thinking of a nutrient-dense daily food source and a storable food for
[2:07:01.960 --> 2:07:05.600]  yourself and family, the time to act is now.
[2:07:05.600 --> 2:07:11.180]  At HempUSA.org, we still believe that food will be your greatest asset in these trying
[2:07:11.180 --> 2:07:12.680]  times ahead.

[2:07:28.880 --> 2:07:33.960]  Families need this high quality natural food source for its low price and long storage shelf
[2:07:33.960 --> 2:07:34.960]  life.
[2:07:34.960 --> 2:07:38.800]  This incredible food source should be a staple part of your diet every day.

[2:07:48.480 --> 2:07:55.040]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[2:07:55.040 --> 2:08:06.760]  It's Alex Jones, and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:08:06.760 --> 2:08:10.120]  Alright folks, we are back at the Alex Jones show.
[2:08:10.120 --> 2:08:14.600]  I'm Jason Bermas and if you want to get at me, it's pretty easy to do myspace.com slash
[2:08:14.600 --> 2:08:17.240]  Jason Bermas B-E-R-M-A-S.
[2:08:17.240 --> 2:08:21.440]  I do read the IM's, the comments, everything.
[2:08:21.440 --> 2:08:26.880]  In fact, one of the stories I'm going to go over is a U.S. school district to begin microchipping
[2:08:26.880 --> 2:08:27.880]  students' bags.
[2:08:27.880 --> 2:08:28.880]  It's real good stuff.
[2:08:28.880 --> 2:08:31.800]  We're going to get into that after we talk this Obama thing.
[2:08:31.800 --> 2:08:34.800]  But yeah, I mean, Zignu Brzezinski is on the team.
[2:08:34.800 --> 2:08:38.800]  Johnson, Jim Johnson, who's a member of Bilderberg, was on the team.
[2:08:38.800 --> 2:08:43.600]  He meets with Hillary in the same locale as the Bilderberg group, undoubtedly with members
[2:08:43.600 --> 2:08:44.720]  of the Bilderberg group.
[2:08:44.720 --> 2:08:47.320]  I think he's a real threat, too, Lance.
[2:08:47.320 --> 2:08:48.840]  I think there's any doubt about it.
[2:08:48.840 --> 2:08:53.800]  I mean, I really appreciate a lot of Paul Craig Roberts analysis, but in this case,
[2:08:53.800 --> 2:08:54.800]  there's no doubt about it.
[2:08:54.800 --> 2:08:57.760]  I mean, we talk a lot about problem reaction solution.
[2:08:57.760 --> 2:09:00.720]  And Zignu Brzezinski is part of the problem.
[2:09:00.720 --> 2:09:05.640]  He bragged about helping radicalize Islam and create the Mujahideen.
[2:09:05.640 --> 2:09:10.240]  Back under Jimmy Carter, there was a 1997 interview with him in a French magazine.
[2:09:10.240 --> 2:09:15.960]  I think it's called the Nouvelle Observateur and as big new, Brzezinski bragged about starting
[2:09:15.960 --> 2:09:16.960]  Mujahideen.
[2:09:16.960 --> 2:09:22.160]  Of course, that was before 9-11 when he thought it was safe to brag that way.
[2:09:22.160 --> 2:09:25.560]  Part of why I was calling in today, Jason, is to let you know, I think you're on the
[2:09:25.560 --> 2:09:31.040]  right track with energizing everybody to just frankly take matters into their own hands
[2:09:31.040 --> 2:09:34.760]  and run for local and state offices around the country.
[2:09:34.760 --> 2:09:36.960]  That's the only thing we can do.
[2:09:36.960 --> 2:09:41.680]  You know, like Charles called in earlier, and I've been a long time listener myself
[2:09:41.680 --> 2:09:45.280]  as well, and I've heard him call in and talk about handing out a lot of DVDs and videos,
[2:09:45.280 --> 2:09:47.200]  and that's essential work.
[2:09:47.200 --> 2:09:53.680]  But people don't really want to hear about soldiers committing war crimes, nonstop.
[2:09:53.680 --> 2:09:56.760]  Most people in our society, I think, just want to be left alone.
[2:09:56.760 --> 2:09:57.760]  Yeah, absolutely.
[2:09:57.760 --> 2:09:59.960]  Well, they don't want to have to think, you know.
[2:09:59.960 --> 2:10:04.560]  They want to be able to just sit back and relax, but a movie, you know, in a short period
[2:10:04.560 --> 2:10:06.840]  of time can turn somebody onto this.
[2:10:06.840 --> 2:10:07.840]  Absolutely.
[2:10:07.840 --> 2:10:08.840]  And people need to be woken up that way.
[2:10:08.840 --> 2:10:12.480]  I mean, I guess, you know, I kind of shy away from the term waking up or waking people
[2:10:12.480 --> 2:10:13.480]  up.
[2:10:13.480 --> 2:10:14.480]  I think, you know, people are awake already.
[2:10:14.480 --> 2:10:18.280]  They're just not paying attention to political issues, and I don't think that's peculiar
[2:10:18.280 --> 2:10:19.280]  to America necessarily.
[2:10:19.280 --> 2:10:20.280]  I think that's worldwide.
[2:10:20.280 --> 2:10:25.760]  Just people generally just want to be left alone and want to just pursue their own interests.
[2:10:25.760 --> 2:10:29.360]  Unfortunately, I think in this country, we're in a position where we don't have that luxury
[2:10:29.360 --> 2:10:30.360]  anymore.
[2:10:30.360 --> 2:10:36.360]  We can't afford to just sit back and let other people run the business of our government
[2:10:36.360 --> 2:10:41.080]  because like Plato said, the price good men pay for indifference to public affairs is
[2:10:41.080 --> 2:10:42.880]  to be ruled by evil men.
[2:10:42.880 --> 2:10:43.880]  That's absolutely right, man.
[2:10:43.880 --> 2:10:46.000]  We've all got to take it on our own responsibility.
[2:10:46.000 --> 2:10:49.520]  I mean, you know, I want to kind of plug my own campaign.
[2:10:49.520 --> 2:10:54.640]  I, in February this year, drove down to Jefferson City, Missouri and filed to be on the ballot
[2:10:54.640 --> 2:10:55.640]  as a state representative.
[2:10:55.640 --> 2:10:56.640]  Got a website?
[2:10:56.640 --> 2:10:57.640]  LanceWeber.com.
[2:10:57.640 --> 2:10:58.640]  L-A-N-C-E-W-E-B-E-R.com.
[2:10:58.640 --> 2:10:59.640]  All right.
[2:10:59.640 --> 2:11:00.640]  My name's Lance Weber.
[2:11:00.640 --> 2:11:09.320]  I'm running in Kansas City, Missouri for a state in the Missouri House of Representatives.
[2:11:09.320 --> 2:11:12.240]  Well, all you listeners out in Missouri, let's support Lance.
[2:11:12.240 --> 2:11:13.240]  I thank you for the call.
[2:11:13.240 --> 2:11:14.640]  I mean, he's called in a couple of times.
[2:11:14.640 --> 2:11:17.040]  He got great points and he's not about the right or left.
[2:11:17.040 --> 2:11:20.240]  He's about right and wrong and that's what we need to be about.
[2:11:20.240 --> 2:11:21.240]  He's right.
[2:11:21.240 --> 2:11:23.160]  Again, we need to become local government.
[2:11:23.160 --> 2:11:25.380]  We need to become the congressman.
[2:11:25.380 --> 2:11:27.480]  We need to become the media.
[2:11:27.480 --> 2:11:29.680]  I can't drill into people's heads enough.
[2:11:29.680 --> 2:11:35.560]  I mean, we can do it if we want to do it or we can sit back and slurp down our brouhaha's.
[2:11:35.560 --> 2:11:36.880]  Let's go to Matt in Pennsylvania.
[2:11:36.880 --> 2:11:37.880]  Matt, are you with us?
[2:11:37.880 --> 2:11:38.880]  Yes, I am.
[2:11:38.880 --> 2:11:39.880]  What's on your mind?
[2:11:39.880 --> 2:11:41.880]  How are you doing, Jason?
[2:11:41.880 --> 2:11:43.280]  Good, man.
[2:11:43.280 --> 2:11:48.440]  I was calling because I wanted to tell you about, you know, you ever hear of PennDOT in
[2:11:48.440 --> 2:11:51.000]  Pennsylvania, the Department of Motor Vehicles?
[2:11:51.000 --> 2:11:52.000]  Okay.
[2:11:52.000 --> 2:11:53.000]  Not really, but okay.
[2:11:53.000 --> 2:11:54.000]  Okay.
[2:11:54.000 --> 2:11:56.760]  Well, they're actually doing a real ID program.
[2:11:56.760 --> 2:11:57.760]  Oh, that's lovely.
[2:11:57.760 --> 2:12:00.560]  It was on my news yesterday, local news.
[2:12:00.560 --> 2:12:03.720]  And it's going to be integrated into the new license or?
[2:12:03.720 --> 2:12:05.720]  Yes, it is.
[2:12:05.720 --> 2:12:07.720]  And I actually called them up.
[2:12:07.720 --> 2:12:10.640]  I spoke to five different people.
[2:12:10.640 --> 2:12:11.960]  Nobody would answer my questions.
[2:12:11.960 --> 2:12:13.400]  Nobody would talk to me.
[2:12:13.400 --> 2:12:19.080]  I actually called the news station and they're actually telling me that they're taking people's
[2:12:19.080 --> 2:12:23.360]  information without rights or consent.
[2:12:23.360 --> 2:12:24.360]  Well, you know what?
[2:12:24.360 --> 2:12:27.560]  You need to go to the next city council meeting, man.
[2:12:27.560 --> 2:12:31.120]  I mean, getting on a radio show like this and letting people know, I mean, obviously,
[2:12:31.120 --> 2:12:34.720]  we have a few listeners out in Pennsylvania, a few of the callers have been from there,
[2:12:34.720 --> 2:12:36.520]  but you got to take it upon yourself.
[2:12:36.520 --> 2:12:37.520]  You know, this is it.
[2:12:37.520 --> 2:12:38.520]  That's right.
[2:12:38.520 --> 2:12:39.520]  This is it.
[2:12:39.520 --> 2:12:40.520]  Listen, get like seven to 10 people.
[2:12:40.520 --> 2:12:44.240]  You better believe it because they've been trying to install this now for the better part
[2:12:44.240 --> 2:12:45.240]  of this decade.
[2:12:45.240 --> 2:12:46.240]  Okay.
[2:12:46.240 --> 2:12:47.800]  Since 2000, they've really wanted to do this.
[2:12:47.800 --> 2:12:51.280]  Obviously, 9-11 was a big push and now they're starting to implement it.
[2:12:51.280 --> 2:12:52.280]  All right.
[2:12:52.280 --> 2:12:53.280]  Well, look at this story.
[2:12:53.280 --> 2:12:54.280]  Let's talk about this really quick.
[2:12:54.280 --> 2:13:00.360]  The U.S. school district, this is out in Rhode Island, okay, is now chipping students.
[2:13:00.360 --> 2:13:03.440]  They're putting them in their bags so that they can track them everywhere.
[2:13:03.440 --> 2:13:05.000]  They're getting us used to this.
[2:13:05.000 --> 2:13:06.000]  I mean...
[2:13:06.000 --> 2:13:07.760]  Well, I mean, I could see it all around me.
[2:13:07.760 --> 2:13:08.760]  Yeah.
[2:13:08.760 --> 2:13:09.760]  I mean, I don't know who can't see it.
[2:13:09.760 --> 2:13:13.440]  I mean, it's all around you and people, you know, just see it on.
[2:13:13.440 --> 2:13:15.760]  I mean, I can't believe the local news even covered it.
[2:13:15.760 --> 2:13:16.760]  Mm-hmm.
[2:13:16.760 --> 2:13:17.760]  You can begin with them.
[2:13:17.760 --> 2:13:18.760]  Well, you know what?
[2:13:18.760 --> 2:13:21.680]  They got to tell us some time and then they just try to put a positive spin on it.
[2:13:21.680 --> 2:13:23.040]  I thank you for the call.
[2:13:23.040 --> 2:13:24.760]  Let's jump to another Pennsylvania caller.
[2:13:24.760 --> 2:13:26.560]  Let's go to Rob in Pennsylvania.
[2:13:26.560 --> 2:13:27.560]  Rob, are you with us?
[2:13:27.560 --> 2:13:28.560]  Yeah, I am.
[2:13:28.560 --> 2:13:29.960]  Thanks for taking my call.
[2:13:29.960 --> 2:13:30.960]  Sure.
[2:13:30.960 --> 2:13:37.120]  I'm going to call and talk about the call with Mike Reagan.
[2:13:37.120 --> 2:13:41.840]  There was at least five points I got of things that he was saying that utterly appalled me.
[2:13:41.840 --> 2:13:47.840]  The first of which is he basically admits in that interview to agreeing that Operation
[2:13:47.840 --> 2:13:53.320]  Northwood is an actual legitimate document and he also agrees that the Gulf of Tonkin
[2:13:53.320 --> 2:13:54.320]  was set up by us.
[2:13:54.320 --> 2:13:58.320]  But his argument is, well, it was done by Democratic administration.
[2:13:58.320 --> 2:14:03.240]  I mean, I find it appalling even if he believes that, right?
[2:14:03.240 --> 2:14:07.840]  And even if he doesn't believe 9-11 was an inside job, how can he not report on this?
[2:14:07.840 --> 2:14:13.440]  I've heard this man talk about Jimmy Carter and FDR through things back to that long
[2:14:13.440 --> 2:14:16.440]  ago, but he doesn't find this noteworthy.
[2:14:16.440 --> 2:14:18.560]  Well, he's an op, dude.
[2:14:18.560 --> 2:14:19.560]  You know, come on.
[2:14:19.560 --> 2:14:20.560]  He's an op.
[2:14:20.560 --> 2:14:21.920]  He's a neocon op.
[2:14:21.920 --> 2:14:24.920]  He gets talking points like the other little neocon ops.
[2:14:24.920 --> 2:14:28.760]  You shouldn't be surprised when it comes out that he's also on some sort of a federal
[2:14:28.760 --> 2:14:30.080]  or government payroll.
[2:14:30.080 --> 2:14:36.040]  They probably kick him another 100, 200 grand a year to just promote their propaganda, man.
[2:14:36.040 --> 2:14:39.040]  I mean, this is Reagan's kid, okay?
[2:14:39.040 --> 2:14:43.200]  I know it's not his blood kid, but it's Reagan's son.
[2:14:43.200 --> 2:14:46.040]  I can only imagine the connections this guy's made.
[2:14:46.040 --> 2:14:49.240]  And of course, he's got to be limited hangout because, you know, again, he probably has talked
[2:14:49.240 --> 2:14:53.840]  about the CFR and the Builder Group before, just like Limbaugh used to talk about it.
[2:14:53.840 --> 2:14:55.760]  You know, it was an accepted thing to talk about.
[2:14:55.760 --> 2:15:00.680]  But as soon as it started shifting from, you know, because if you remember, Jones actually
[2:15:00.680 --> 2:15:03.920]  promoted Buchanan, you know, gave to his campaign back then.
[2:15:03.920 --> 2:15:07.480]  People were still fooled into this false left-right paradigm.
[2:15:07.480 --> 2:15:11.960]  But with the attacks of 9-11, with the cover up on both ends, more and more people are
[2:15:11.960 --> 2:15:15.000]  realizing it doesn't matter whether you're Democrat or Republican.
[2:15:15.000 --> 2:15:19.160]  I mean, obviously, Paul Craig Roberts still, you know, has a long way to go there.
[2:15:19.160 --> 2:15:22.400]  He still thinks the Democrats are slightly better, but I'm not going to choose the lesser
[2:15:22.400 --> 2:15:23.400]  of two evils.
[2:15:23.400 --> 2:15:24.400]  You know what I'm saying?
[2:15:24.400 --> 2:15:25.400]  Yeah.
[2:15:25.400 --> 2:15:26.400]  I just, I agree 100%.
[2:15:26.400 --> 2:15:31.600]  I just think that the absurdity of being able to boldface tell all the, what, supposedly
[2:15:31.600 --> 2:15:35.800]  5 million listeners of the years every night, that, you know, I agree that this stuff happened,
[2:15:35.800 --> 2:15:38.240]  but I don't think that you're, this is worthy news.
[2:15:38.240 --> 2:15:40.080]  I mean, it's just a joke.
[2:15:40.080 --> 2:15:44.560]  And if you, I would encourage anyone out there that if you ever do happen to stumble upon
[2:15:44.560 --> 2:15:49.360]  these shows, just to listen to things like that, that like, they think that the American
[2:15:49.360 --> 2:15:52.440]  public aren't worth reporting this information to.
[2:15:52.440 --> 2:15:56.920]  And it's disgusting and they'll accuse us of not being patriots yet.
[2:15:56.920 --> 2:16:01.720]  I mean, honestly, how could you consider yourself a patriot when you have 5 million people in
[2:16:01.720 --> 2:16:06.320]  your audience and you utterly believe that the Gulf of Tonkin was set up by the United
[2:16:06.320 --> 2:16:08.120]  States and you never reported it?
[2:16:08.120 --> 2:16:10.600]  Well, he likes slipping on his big bed of money, man.
[2:16:10.600 --> 2:16:11.600]  Thanks, Rob, for the phone call.
[2:16:11.600 --> 2:16:15.880]  Yeah, I mean, he's kicking back in a, in a king-sized bed, probably has a good-looking
[2:16:15.880 --> 2:16:18.320]  wife, big screen, television.
[2:16:18.320 --> 2:16:20.840]  He's living in the lap of luxury like he always has been.
[2:16:20.840 --> 2:16:25.160]  Like I said, he's a spoiled rich kid and he's not in reality.
[2:16:25.160 --> 2:16:26.560]  He gets talking points.
[2:16:26.560 --> 2:16:28.200]  He works for them.
[2:16:28.200 --> 2:16:29.200]  That's the bottom line.
[2:16:29.200 --> 2:16:30.400]  Let's go to Derek in Texas.
[2:16:30.400 --> 2:16:31.400]  Derek, are you with us?
[2:16:31.400 --> 2:16:32.400]  I'm with you, Jason.
[2:16:32.400 --> 2:16:38.400]  Hey, there needs to be more people like you and radio and less people like Mike Reagan
[2:16:38.400 --> 2:16:39.400]  and my opinion.
[2:16:39.400 --> 2:16:40.720]  You're doing a really good job.
[2:16:40.720 --> 2:16:41.720]  Thanks, man.
[2:16:41.720 --> 2:16:45.000]  Well, I mean, these guys, these guys, you know, you know what kills me about these guys is
[2:16:45.000 --> 2:16:50.040]  they've got the crazy national audience and there are a lot of nutballs out there that
[2:16:50.040 --> 2:16:54.200]  are totally gung-ho, kill the brown people, kill the people that support them and for
[2:16:54.200 --> 2:16:58.720]  him to say that, for him to say he'll pay for the bullet after advocating for the murder
[2:16:58.720 --> 2:17:02.200]  of Mark Dice and other 9-11 truthers is just unreal.
[2:17:02.200 --> 2:17:03.200]  Well, absolutely.
[2:17:03.200 --> 2:17:09.640]  And I want to encourage Alex Jones' audience to call these neocon shows, get by the screener
[2:17:09.640 --> 2:17:14.080]  and let them have the truth to wake these audiences up because each one of these audiences
[2:17:14.080 --> 2:17:17.520]  are a couple million a week and that's work we need to do.
[2:17:17.520 --> 2:17:18.520]  Oh, absolutely.
[2:17:18.520 --> 2:17:25.600]  Just to let you know, I'm a member of AE911Truth.org and I appreciate Richard Gage and your work.
[2:17:25.600 --> 2:17:30.600]  You guys have done fantastic and I would like to issue an edict to all the engineering
[2:17:30.600 --> 2:17:31.600]  undergrads.
[2:17:31.600 --> 2:17:35.880]  You know, when I was going to school, 9-11 happened and I'm a structural engineer and
[2:17:35.880 --> 2:17:41.440]  the comment that got made to me by my professors who had PhDs in the subject was, huh, looks
[2:17:41.440 --> 2:17:45.720]  like they figured out a new way to perform a control demolition and the chatter that
[2:17:45.720 --> 2:17:49.840]  was going around was like, well, why don't they just, you know, swing a ball into the
[2:17:49.840 --> 2:17:53.720]  top of the building and set a fire then wait an hour and it just comes tumbling down.
[2:17:53.720 --> 2:17:58.120]  I mean, it was just ridiculous to us at the time, but really it wasn't until Alex a couple
[2:17:58.120 --> 2:18:01.880]  years later to where I saw everything and man, just keep going.
[2:18:01.880 --> 2:18:04.240]  I mean, you guys are doing fantastic.
[2:18:04.240 --> 2:18:09.320]  Sooner or later, this is going to be out and, you know, these people in this neocon administration
[2:18:09.320 --> 2:18:14.040]  are going to be judged harshly because history will view you, Jason and Alex and the other
[2:18:14.040 --> 2:18:17.040]  guys as the ones to turn everything around.
[2:18:17.040 --> 2:18:18.040]  Well, thanks.
[2:18:18.040 --> 2:18:19.040]  Thank you so much.
[2:18:19.040 --> 2:18:21.440]  And, you know, that is a great organization.
[2:18:21.440 --> 2:18:25.040]  Architects and engineers for 9-11Truth really give us a huge amount of validity and right
[2:18:25.040 --> 2:18:29.600]  now if you're an architect or an engineer and you're not a part of this organization,
[2:18:29.600 --> 2:18:31.040]  we need you more than ever.
[2:18:31.040 --> 2:18:35.200]  Good Gage is trying to get a thousand people to sign up before September 11th and he's
[2:18:35.200 --> 2:18:38.000]  looming somewhere around the 400 mark.
[2:18:38.000 --> 2:18:40.040]  Now that means we need 600 more of you guys.
[2:18:40.040 --> 2:18:44.200]  If you know somebody who knows this information, encourage them to speak up.
[2:18:44.200 --> 2:18:45.200]  All right.
[2:18:45.200 --> 2:18:46.200]  Don't hide in the shadows.
[2:18:46.200 --> 2:18:50.040]  If we hide in the shadows, there'll be no shadows to hide in eventually.
[2:18:50.040 --> 2:18:51.280]  You can't run from this stuff forever.
[2:18:51.280 --> 2:18:53.760]  You've got to face it head on and that's what I'm all about.
[2:18:53.760 --> 2:18:55.880]  Let's take one more caller before the next break.
[2:18:55.880 --> 2:18:57.480]  Let's go to James in Ohio.
[2:18:57.480 --> 2:18:58.480]  James, are you with us?
[2:18:58.480 --> 2:18:59.480]  How are you doing, Jason?
[2:18:59.480 --> 2:19:00.480]  Good, man.
[2:19:00.480 --> 2:19:01.480]  What's on your mind?
[2:19:01.480 --> 2:19:02.480]  I don't know if you remember.
[2:19:02.480 --> 2:19:03.640]  I talked to you a while ago.
[2:19:03.640 --> 2:19:09.680]  You had Jim Mars on you were sitting in for Alex and you guys were all on the law enforcement
[2:19:09.680 --> 2:19:13.720]  aspect of police state and stuff.
[2:19:13.720 --> 2:19:19.160]  I was caller that spoke about getting egged in the side of the head and arrested for not
[2:19:19.160 --> 2:19:20.160]  giving my ID up.
[2:19:20.160 --> 2:19:21.160]  Yep.
[2:19:21.160 --> 2:19:22.160]  Yep.
[2:19:22.160 --> 2:19:23.160]  That whole fiasco.
[2:19:23.160 --> 2:19:24.160]  How's that turning out for you right now?
[2:19:24.160 --> 2:19:26.720]  It was already resolved when I talked to you.
[2:19:26.720 --> 2:19:28.720]  I just didn't get a chance to finish the whole thing.
[2:19:28.720 --> 2:19:32.160]  All right, well, hold on, hold on, I'll pass the break and we'll go over how that was resolved.
[2:19:32.160 --> 2:19:34.960]  This guy was attacked and then of course the police arrest him.
[2:19:34.960 --> 2:19:36.720]  You know, that's how it goes in America.
[2:19:36.720 --> 2:19:38.160]  We're going to come back on the other side.
[2:19:38.160 --> 2:19:47.480]  It's the Alex Jones show info wars.com.

[2:20:53.360 --> 2:20:58.960]  debt increased to a record high in 1999 reaching a peak of fourteen point eight trillion dollars
[2:20:58.960 --> 2:21:04.560]  marking ten point five seven percent annual increase outpacing its previous ten years the US
[2:21:04.560 --> 2:21:09.200]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through private banking institution called the

[2:24:31.040 --> 2:24:39.680]  well basically uh i got charged with causing alarm and annoyance to others because i told the
[2:24:39.680 --> 2:24:47.280]  cop that i felt i was the victim what do you need my driver's license for and he charged me with it
[2:24:47.280 --> 2:24:51.680]  now they didn't they arrested me took me to the station but they didn't take me to the jail they
[2:24:51.680 --> 2:24:57.600]  just so tried to figure out what charges to give me then once they gave me one they let me go and
[2:24:57.600 --> 2:25:03.120]  then i had to go to court when i got to court i pretty much i talked to an attorney friend and
[2:25:03.120 --> 2:25:07.680]  he said you know this is bogus just plead no contest judge you'll see right through this
[2:25:07.680 --> 2:25:14.320]  and the judge's response was well since nine eleven officer asked you your name you better give it to
[2:25:14.320 --> 2:25:22.000]  him so i'm going to give you a court cost and a hundred dollar fine like okay so yeah i never
[2:25:22.000 --> 2:25:28.480]  tried to pursue it after that i just took took it whatever but i do want to uh echo this sediment

[2:25:48.960 --> 2:25:56.640]  i'm calling today is uh over the weekend where i live here in ohio we had a uh a tazering incident
[2:25:56.640 --> 2:26:02.240]  okay and the and the reason i think that it really deserves to be put in the limelight
[2:26:02.240 --> 2:26:11.200]  is it was tazering of a juvenile how old was the kid 15 and what did she do she was uh i guess in
[2:26:11.200 --> 2:26:19.280]  in a fight or a confrontation with another girl when the cops came and tased her for it and she
[2:26:19.280 --> 2:26:27.600]  didn't stop us when the cops says you can see the uh video at like uh w m f m j channel 20
[2:26:27.600 --> 2:26:30.800]  listen why don't you say why don't you send me a link because i got to jump because i'm about to
[2:26:30.800 --> 2:26:34.800]  have we are change on but send uh era info war is a link and we'll we'll try to post the video

[2:26:38.800 --> 2:26:43.840]  couver and discuss the incident uh with colin powell let's go to brian in new york brian what's up
[2:26:45.120 --> 2:26:51.520]  hello hey how you doing brian how are you good man um i was uh i'm gonna call about um
[2:26:52.320 --> 2:27:00.560]  mark dois was sending the dvds yep to soldiers well if you have a myspace account you can go
[2:27:00.560 --> 2:27:10.320]  into search and change the country to iraq and you'll get about thousands of troops have a myspace
[2:27:10.320 --> 2:27:16.000]  yep and you can put it in there you can become friends with them or you can just put great idea
[2:27:16.000 --> 2:27:20.160]  and you can just embed videos right there absolutely and i hope that people do it in a
[2:27:20.160 --> 2:27:24.720]  respectful manner i think that the the mailing thing though is just a little bit more personal
[2:27:25.360 --> 2:27:29.680]  and it lets you get an end with you know some kind of food product or maybe you do have the
[2:27:29.680 --> 2:27:35.120]  money to you know buy a dvd player maybe you do have the money to kick them you know an actual dvd
[2:27:35.120 --> 2:27:39.840]  of something else or a hard hard copy but yeah that's another great way to get it people and
[2:27:39.840 --> 2:27:44.800]  just do it respectfully just be like look man you know i i just hope that you're aware that
[2:27:44.800 --> 2:27:49.680]  this stuff is going on and this this has nothing to do with you i just hope this helps you make a
[2:27:49.680 --> 2:27:56.560]  a better more informed decision and um can i bring up another point sure go ahead what do you think
[2:27:56.560 --> 2:28:04.560]  the probability of um was it flight 77 that crashed in shanksville no that was flight 93 and uh
[2:28:04.560 --> 2:28:10.080]  and i gotta tell you there is no chance whatsoever that that plane was downed in that open field
[2:28:10.080 --> 2:28:15.040]  in shanksville pennsylvania there's a possibility that something was shot down uh over that area
[2:28:15.040 --> 2:28:19.200]  possibly but the majority of it didn't crash in that open field in shanksville pennsylvania if
[2:28:19.200 --> 2:28:24.240]  that is the case i have no idea where that plane actually is if if it wasn't the one that was
[2:28:24.240 --> 2:28:30.640]  shot down over it um you know again they're they're following flight 93 they're also following a
[2:28:30.640 --> 2:28:35.760]  phantom flight at the same exact time you know it it's unbelievable they they were following
[2:28:35.760 --> 2:28:40.240]  delta eight 1989 at the same time that supposedly had bombs on board they had hijackings coming in
[2:28:40.240 --> 2:28:46.080]  out of canada later on they had hijackings coming in out of uh out of alaska i believe with korean
[2:28:46.080 --> 2:28:51.520]  airlines so i mean i'm not convinced at all i didn't see a piece of an engine i didn't see a piece of
[2:28:51.520 --> 2:28:58.400]  uh a tail section a wing section i didn't see bodies i didn't see luggage i didn't see a plane
[2:28:58.400 --> 2:29:05.040]  crash okay i had to wait four and a half years to see two pieces of fuselage and a uh a red headband
[2:29:05.040 --> 2:29:09.600]  that was untouched that supposedly the hijackers war and you can watch that all for free at loose
[2:29:09.600 --> 2:29:14.640]  change uh loose change 911.com they got a little link to the movie i mean you can check it out on

[2:29:47.200 --> 2:29:51.840]  doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a ph balanced
[2:29:51.840 --> 2:29:57.280]  alkaline environment but as you know most people are overly acidic due to stress acidic diet and

[2:30:02.480 --> 2:30:07.200]  prevention of disease people who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood
[2:30:07.200 --> 2:30:12.640]  sugar mental clarity and loss of weight it was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water
[2:30:12.640 --> 2:30:17.600]  but due to modern way of life most people are overly acidic the fact is that disease simply
[2:30:17.600 --> 2:30:21.920]  cannot exist in an alkaline environment fat accumulates if a person consumes too much
[2:30:21.920 --> 2:30:27.680]  acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it do your part alkalize and supercharge your body

[2:33:23.760 --> 2:33:28.800]  show my brother hey no problem man so why don't you just fill people in on the situation uh with
[2:33:28.800 --> 2:33:33.280]  colon powell yet again we're trying to become the media we're trying to ask real questions we're
[2:33:33.280 --> 2:33:38.000]  trying to make a difference in this country and what happens well i guess let's start off with
[2:33:38.000 --> 2:33:43.280]  gail davidson who was from lawyers against a little coalition of lawyers um they tried to get
[2:33:43.280 --> 2:33:48.720]  colon powell inadmissible to canada colon powell actually the more i researched into the past the
[2:33:48.720 --> 2:33:53.840]  more discussed than to start by god whether it was covering up the my lane massacre trying to cover
[2:33:53.840 --> 2:34:00.960]  up the my lane massacre in 1969 whether it was in uh 91 fabricating 2,500 tanks with forged
[2:34:00.960 --> 2:34:06.320]  satellite imagery whether it was the speech alive that he delivered any militia was on and gone uh
[2:34:06.320 --> 2:34:12.480]  on and on the addition play torture that you know these are many strikes against the geneva
[2:34:12.480 --> 2:34:17.600]  convention so anyway gail davidson tried to get powell um basically not allowed into the country
[2:34:17.600 --> 2:34:23.520]  and petitioned our immigration minister diane finley of course uh we've got a conservative
[2:34:23.520 --> 2:34:28.160]  government now in canada led by a manchurian candidate of a prime minister named steven harper
[2:34:28.160 --> 2:34:33.120]  that's a complete trader to us he signed on february 14th with no parliamentary oversight
[2:34:33.120 --> 2:34:38.640]  a law allowing foreign troops on canadian soil so we've got our um we got our hands full up here
[2:34:38.640 --> 2:34:44.400]  anyway the petition from lawyers against war went nowhere the immigration minister didn't even uh
[2:34:44.400 --> 2:34:50.000]  you know basically let it let it happen um so anyway we had colin powell come and talk about
[2:34:50.000 --> 2:34:55.120]  leadership we bought tickets four of our change members me james flack my co-director and posh
[2:34:55.120 --> 2:35:00.080]  and rock shana from vancouver 9 11 we bought tickets to go inside and uh these organizers
[2:35:00.080 --> 2:35:03.760]  have built the event as no question would be off-limits so we thought this would be a great
[2:35:03.760 --> 2:35:08.240]  chance to ask colin powell about the stance on the plated uranium which he is on the record
[2:35:08.240 --> 2:35:14.480]  we are change ohio confronted that powell on du a while back and colin powell lied again like
[2:35:14.480 --> 2:35:18.800]  the other panopio powell lied again and said that du is completely safe and that he had been around
[2:35:18.800 --> 2:35:22.800]  about his life i mean it just takes a simple google search to look at what the effects of the
[2:35:22.800 --> 2:35:27.440]  plated uranium are and four and a half billion year shelf life to just realize that's absurd
[2:35:27.440 --> 2:35:32.800]  so anyway the question answer period goes on um i'm sorry powell goes on and speaks about you know
[2:35:32.800 --> 2:35:38.080]  he regurgitates the same lies about men hiding out in caves and not giving up our
[2:35:38.080 --> 2:35:42.560]  freedoms and yadda yadda yadda really boring to tell you the truth jason while he was talking
[2:35:42.560 --> 2:35:46.960]  i was text messaging our protesters that were outside bullhorning we had johnny little patrick
[2:35:46.960 --> 2:35:51.600]  darron uh drew a bunch of people from our group bullhorning the venue and i was directing them
[2:35:51.600 --> 2:35:55.440]  through text message to get them closer closer closer they were bullhorning the event so we
[2:35:55.440 --> 2:36:00.320]  could hear the bullhorning inside the venue which was absolutely amazing and uh gave me the strength
[2:36:00.320 --> 2:36:04.800]  to to get to the question answer period the question answer period with a complete fraud
[2:36:04.800 --> 2:36:11.040]  um the organizers basically gave us cards when you entered the venue and instead of no questions
[2:36:11.040 --> 2:36:18.240]  off-limits you're to hand write down your um your your questions on cards oh isn't that freedom
[2:36:18.240 --> 2:36:22.480]  oh they're gonna decide everybody everybody write down a question and then we're gonna choose the
[2:36:22.480 --> 2:36:30.240]  ones we like exactly so get this this is where it got absolutely absurd so uh question i think
[2:36:30.240 --> 2:36:36.160]  number two or three was general iphone or blackberry you know who really gets it down about that i mean
[2:36:36.160 --> 2:36:41.280]  come on then it went into question number four general now that the stanley cut playoffs are
[2:36:41.280 --> 2:36:46.240]  over who are you going for leaker's or Celtic's and and that was enough and you know that his
[2:36:46.240 --> 2:36:50.960]  staff totally loads up the questions too we don't give it we don't give it down about basketball
[2:36:50.960 --> 2:36:55.360]  up here no one's asked no one cares about the leaker than Celtic that's ridiculous we want to
[2:36:55.360 --> 2:37:00.720]  know how he plans on staying out of the hang it's it's absolutely ridiculous um so yeah i jumped
[2:37:00.720 --> 2:37:06.800]  up out of my feet in front of 1500 members of his fan club sheep uh just idiots to tell you the
[2:37:06.800 --> 2:37:11.360]  truth people that had no idea of his history and uh and i yelled up at the top of my lungs
[2:37:11.360 --> 2:37:16.560]  you know i got a question with all due respect i got a question i got a question and the moderator
[2:37:16.560 --> 2:37:22.720]  talked over me uh i tried to silence me that's when jayna flack who's uh an absolutely you know
[2:37:22.720 --> 2:37:26.320]  we've just signed him on as a co-director with weird change vancouver he's an absolute
[2:37:26.880 --> 2:37:31.600]  patriot jumped up and he said i got a question explain to me why the hell you're using depleted
[2:37:31.600 --> 2:37:36.800]  uranium and killing generations of future life oh they don't want the real questions you know
[2:37:36.800 --> 2:37:43.200]  oh no he's a good guy stop yeah exactly and as soon as we jumped up and we demanded you know ask
[2:37:43.200 --> 2:37:48.160]  some real questions we had vancouver police department all over us and escorted so when we
[2:37:48.160 --> 2:37:54.640]  got to the doors um there was another member of our group uh a 50-year-old ballet teacher i mean
[2:37:54.640 --> 2:37:59.200]  this doesn't get any this is just ridiculous 50-year-old ballet teacher by the name of rock santa
[2:37:59.840 --> 2:38:05.600]  who got up to ask the question as well you know what about du and then she asked that three more
[2:38:05.600 --> 2:38:10.480]  plain clothes got on her and actually physically bounced her at the door the video is unbelievable
[2:38:10.480 --> 2:38:16.320]  we've got posted uh but anyway while this was going on jason unbelievably on the outside this
[2:38:16.320 --> 2:38:21.040]  is what this is what's really messed up about this whole incident on the outside we had hired out
[2:38:21.040 --> 2:38:26.320]  a uh independent freelance uh cameraman a friend of mine from the film world a friend that's got
[2:38:26.320 --> 2:38:31.760]  no political affiliations a friend uh things mike barcelona doesn't even know who alex jones is
[2:38:32.400 --> 2:38:37.440]  i'd ask him to come out and just document the protest outside he was like sure no problem
[2:38:37.440 --> 2:38:42.320]  get some protests for the genre real no problem i'll help you out travel so anyway as we're getting
[2:38:42.320 --> 2:38:47.840]  bounced out of the venue he's on the sidewalk outside of the vancouver convention center a
[2:38:47.840 --> 2:38:54.080]  facility i believe that was paid by the taxpayer money filming protesters when he has one uh an
[2:38:54.080 --> 2:38:58.640]  officer murdoch come over to him and said says right off the hot he says you're going to jail
[2:38:59.520 --> 2:39:03.840]  and what mike didn't know is that this officer murdoch had told a couple people
[2:39:03.840 --> 2:39:08.160]  50 feet away earlier that it's time to leave all right so the cameraman didn't notice we have
[2:39:08.160 --> 2:39:14.080]  footage that shows uh officer murdoch looking at mike and giving him a bit of a smear so
[2:39:14.080 --> 2:39:18.720]  there's a couple theories i have on why he went for our cameraman and and arrested him
[2:39:19.280 --> 2:39:24.480]  michael barcelona now is a court date for july 21st what are they charging him with they're
[2:39:24.480 --> 2:39:30.000]  charging him with assault by trespass which is a which is a charge so uh ludic that our
[2:39:30.000 --> 2:39:34.880]  lawyer gail david and has been great and stepped up for it it said she's never even found it's a
[2:39:34.880 --> 2:39:39.040]  case of this being actually prosecuted so they're just trying to smear him get him in the system
[2:39:39.040 --> 2:39:44.960]  they haven't in jail for nine hours bow down to our masters don't don't resist what was it an assault
[2:39:44.960 --> 2:39:52.080]  by trespass yeah that's exactly right the stop by trespass um just it's just absolutely absurd
[2:39:52.080 --> 2:39:56.560]  now you don't even have to hurt anybody physically you don't even have to verbally assault somebody
[2:39:56.560 --> 2:40:01.680]  anymore you just have to quote unquote trespass which could be anything from being on the wrong
[2:40:01.680 --> 2:40:06.640]  sidewalk at the wrong time at the wrong place and you're you're now charged with assault
[2:40:06.640 --> 2:40:11.360]  by trespass that's that's incredible to me it's absolutely absurd and this is canada where we're
[2:40:11.360 --> 2:40:17.280]  the land of the free yeah not likely so anyway yeah well this was well this was just just after
[2:40:17.280 --> 2:40:23.600]  this it all happened um drew an octal drew an octal's got a he's a great great patriot he's
[2:40:23.600 --> 2:40:28.800]  organizing something called the march on autowalk 2008 uh dot com you go check out his website drew
[2:40:28.800 --> 2:40:33.600]  was on his way out of the venue afterwards and he was followed by vancouver police department
[2:40:33.600 --> 2:40:39.280]  on his bicycle and stopped twice for not riding a helmet now if the context of this uh jason is
[2:40:39.280 --> 2:40:45.040]  that right around the corner we're uh the lower east side of vancouver is one of the most notorious
[2:40:45.040 --> 2:40:50.080]  uh her drugs drug spots in all of the world there's guys who got needles hanging out of their arms
[2:40:50.080 --> 2:40:56.080]  it's a terrible situation down there but they're hassling targeting and hassling peaceful protesters
[2:40:56.080 --> 2:41:00.320]  so you know i've got mixed emotions about how this whole thing went down because
[2:41:00.320 --> 2:41:04.000]  almost the whole time the vpd were incredible they were really good they were letting us
[2:41:04.000 --> 2:41:10.480]  low hole uh sorry bullhorn uh advanced into the facility they were great we had an employee from
[2:41:10.480 --> 2:41:13.840]  the vancouver convention center come on and said you guys have all the rights to be out here to
[2:41:13.840 --> 2:41:19.760]  protest then all of a sudden either the call got made uh a switch got tripped because all of a
[2:41:19.760 --> 2:41:23.920]  sudden the police went from super cool to one of them saying you guys got to get out of here now
[2:41:23.920 --> 2:41:28.320]  i think it coincided with when the event was over and they didn't want protesters getting in the
[2:41:28.320 --> 2:41:33.200]  elite's way what i think is yeah you don't want to be in an earshot a colon pal a guy who's uh
[2:41:33.760 --> 2:41:39.040]  basically propagated the murder of thousands of people and gets up there and smiles and plays
[2:41:39.040 --> 2:41:45.600]  the good cop you know and when he leaves the administration oh they were so bad i'm not one
[2:41:45.600 --> 2:41:52.000]  of them yeah right he gets up a war criminal oh absolute war criminal absolute war criminal
[2:41:52.000 --> 2:41:57.200]  still he belongs in jail he belongs locked up along with the rest of the scumbags you know what jason
[2:41:57.200 --> 2:42:03.360]  i'm just sick and tired of these satanic inbredded pinocchio psychopaths that are messing up the
[2:42:03.360 --> 2:42:08.000]  planet right now i'm sick of them i know you're sick of them enough to enough with these guys and
[2:42:08.000 --> 2:42:12.480]  you know what people they're not going to stop until everyone gets off their butts stop being
[2:42:12.480 --> 2:42:17.520]  that keyboard warrior and get in the group and do it peacefully you know what when when it all went
[2:42:17.520 --> 2:42:23.040]  down we had a lot of help uh i just before i forget here can uh luke wordowski came through a huge
[2:42:23.040 --> 2:42:27.520]  jim and david from freedom fighter radio came through huge they had people calling from all
[2:42:27.520 --> 2:42:32.560]  over the world calling the vancouver police department switchboard and uh shut it down more
[2:42:32.560 --> 2:42:37.280]  or less to get our camera man free and i just wanted to throw your website right now and i
[2:42:37.280 --> 2:42:41.520]  want to let people know because i also get you know emails from people all the time what can i

[2:43:28.640 --> 2:43:35.600]  that you know we need to promote and we are change is the premier uh patriot organization in my eyes

[2:46:36.400 --> 2:46:45.120]  of interest to travis uh paul craig robert and jonathan who was on yesterday um it's a little
[2:46:45.120 --> 2:46:50.800]  no fact but it's it's it's really nailed down there have been u.s citizens that are not of
[2:46:50.800 --> 2:46:58.320]  non-arab background uh have not committed a crime who have been basically abducted
[2:46:59.600 --> 2:47:06.160]  and held in the in in the example of one john in atlanta for five and a half months
[2:47:06.960 --> 2:47:13.440]  without charges uh in isolation without access to outside communication
[2:47:13.440 --> 2:47:22.240]  or a lawyer this is this is a uh little known fact there are some journalists that do not get
[2:47:22.240 --> 2:47:33.760]  play uh james brovar who has his own news agency in the washington dc uh suburbs is knows at least
[2:47:33.760 --> 2:47:41.280]  a half a dozen cases of u.s citizens having been treated this way georgia homeland security
[2:47:41.280 --> 2:47:47.760]  uh federal homeland security and decalb county uh security or whatever they are
[2:47:48.560 --> 2:47:57.360]  uh arrested or abducted is a better word uh a gentleman young man uh from atlanta
[2:47:58.240 --> 2:48:05.040]  and he was only released in the end of october of of uh o3 well fred do us a favor uh email us
[2:48:05.040 --> 2:48:10.400]  these stories we'd love to do a story on american citizens being detained uh you know under military
[2:48:10.400 --> 2:48:15.120]  commission zack patriot and all this stuff sure let me just say that the only way he was able to
[2:48:15.120 --> 2:48:23.040]  to to get out was that that a doctor said that she basically realized that he was never going to be
[2:48:23.040 --> 2:48:29.440]  released a woman doctor and she smuggled out a note and then he was able to use habeas corpus
[2:48:30.240 --> 2:48:36.320]  so it's happening to people who have no uh connection with the military please send it out
[2:48:36.320 --> 2:48:41.280]  to uh erina info wars dot com i thank you for the call it's not shocking to me that they're
[2:48:41.280 --> 2:48:47.760]  actually doing this travis i mean when when you see the type of horrific things that they're able
[2:48:47.760 --> 2:48:53.520]  to do overseas and then you look at 911 how they were able just to extinguish 3000 plus lives on
[2:48:53.520 --> 2:48:58.960]  that day to get their agenda across it doesn't shock me anymore man it doesn't mean either jason
[2:48:58.960 --> 2:49:03.520]  you know what my grandfather fought the Nazis and unfortunately they've been reincarnated it
[2:49:03.520 --> 2:49:09.040]  doesn't shock me at all when we go and do uh informationing about 9-11 i go with vancouver
[2:49:09.040 --> 2:49:13.360]  9-11 truth people quite a bit they're a great group of people and what we get a comment a lot
[2:49:13.360 --> 2:49:17.920]  of the time is by people that are like there's no way that government would would kill 3 000 people
[2:49:17.920 --> 2:49:23.120]  are you guys crazy and it's like what about the gulf of tonkin where they made up lives and they
[2:49:23.120 --> 2:49:26.960]  went to war and they killed 60 000 your troops and 3 million vietnamese i mean people can't
[2:49:26.960 --> 2:49:32.720]  comprehend the end justifies the means mentality that these psychopaths have is no humanity
[2:49:32.720 --> 2:49:36.240]  it's just uh you know you gotta look at the big picture if you don't think dick shaney
[2:49:36.880 --> 2:49:40.880]  and george bush were willing to write off a couple five three thousand people

[2:54:49.920 --> 2:54:54.880]  and it's really just an extraordinary film and then i'm i'm very happy was put together it shows
[2:54:54.880 --> 2:55:00.000]  the activist part of this movement and we need more of it so i'm going to take some more callers
[2:55:00.000 --> 2:55:04.240]  before the top of the hour and we've got justin in texas on the line and if you disagree which
[2:55:04.240 --> 2:55:11.200]  i'm sure he does you go to the front so uh justin what's up hey i was just calling today to remind
[2:55:11.200 --> 2:55:17.040]  everybody that there's going to be a big debate between uh richard gauge and mark roberts tonight
[2:55:17.040 --> 2:55:20.640]  i think it's supposed to be on hard fire so for everyone to keep an eye out for that
[2:55:20.640 --> 2:55:24.800]  okay so it'll probably be up on the net tomorrow huh it should be a pretty quick i'm assuming
[2:55:24.800 --> 2:55:29.520]  and uh that's richard gauge is a pretty big name for the truth movement so it should prove to be
[2:55:29.520 --> 2:55:36.480]  pretty entertaining uh if nothing else i also wanted to bring up the unsecured coins story
[2:55:36.480 --> 2:55:40.560]  all right well let me let me get a second in here so here's the problem with all that
[2:55:40.560 --> 2:55:46.640]  you guys use lies anyway i mean you're used to lying uh you lie every day in your little debunker
[2:55:46.640 --> 2:55:51.040]  sites and then it's okay for you to make up a lie about a real issue let me let me tell you about
[2:55:51.040 --> 2:55:55.760]  an article i got right in front of me okay u.s school district to begin micro chipping students
[2:55:55.760 --> 2:55:59.600]  now admittedly they're not putting the student the uh chips in the arms of the students but
[2:55:59.600 --> 2:56:03.760]  they're putting it in their backpack and they're tracking them everywhere they go now back in 2006
[2:56:03.760 --> 2:56:08.640]  i got four separate articles all about how the pentagon is now going to start chipping soldiers
[2:56:08.640 --> 2:56:13.040]  so it's something that's really happening you're using the truth and then you're making up a story
[2:56:13.040 --> 2:56:18.960]  on it and lying so that we cover it i mean you guys lie all the time that's the problem man at
[2:56:18.960 --> 2:56:24.160]  least i'm trying to tell the truth justin there's just uh there was a i thought a legitimate point
[2:56:24.160 --> 2:56:31.680]  to be made by the fact that pretty much every single person who emailed uh unsecured coins
[2:56:31.680 --> 2:56:36.880]  uh his handle on jreff uh immediately got a response uh letting him know that the story
[2:56:36.880 --> 2:56:42.320]  was not uh real justin why would i want you to have a justin but justin why would i engage him
[2:56:42.320 --> 2:56:48.720]  when he's done nothing but uh you know true for this and you know justin saw us justin sold
[2:56:48.720 --> 2:56:53.840]  the why why would i believe him because he's putting out there on a public that's a critic of
[2:56:53.840 --> 2:56:59.040]  of loose change obviously because it's happening to soldiers man it is happening to soldiers
[2:56:59.040 --> 2:57:03.360]  and i thought he may have been the luck the uh the unlucky one to get picked i thought maybe
[2:57:03.360 --> 2:57:08.080]  you know it might turn him around and put him into more of a human state and realize that this is a
[2:57:08.080 --> 2:57:11.760]  problem i'm sorry dude are you for people getting shipped because i remember reading some of your
[2:57:11.760 --> 2:57:16.800]  comments on there and it was like well you're still my actually some of the comments that i posted
[2:57:16.800 --> 2:57:22.560]  were specifically just to embellish but exactly and that's another point justin but that's another
[2:57:22.560 --> 2:57:28.320]  point you're trying to specifically hold on you're specifically lying on purpose you're trying to
[2:57:28.320 --> 2:57:34.640]  engage the enemy with false information about a true subject so that you can discredit them that's
[2:57:34.640 --> 2:57:38.720]  classic propaganda man i mean i don't think you're on a payroll or anything but you're engaging in
[2:57:38.720 --> 2:57:44.160]  the same tactics that the media uses it's just like all right in 2004 it came out in the mainstream
[2:57:44.160 --> 2:57:48.880]  media that all these mexican officials took chips to get the secure locations and they put out a
[2:57:48.880 --> 2:57:54.080]  crazy number like 144 to kind of test the waters and then a few months later they had to admit
[2:57:54.080 --> 2:57:57.520]  that it was much lower number but they wanted to see how the media was going to react to that
[2:57:58.160 --> 2:58:04.320]  purposeful dis info justin thanks for the call um we got uh we are change who is it we got we are

[3:01:41.440 --> 3:01:46.640]  what's up first i want to comment on you know your show and alex i mean you guys it's really brave i
[3:01:46.640 --> 3:01:51.360]  mean sometimes i happen to run into just to see what kind of propaganda i get on the hannity and
[3:01:51.360 --> 3:01:56.160]  all rim balls and all that crap and i tell you makes me nauseous i cannot understand how people
[3:01:56.160 --> 3:02:01.680]  listen to that propaganda anyway that's it i just want to give some information for your listeners
[3:02:01.680 --> 3:02:08.080]  in new york okay i was um i just don't know remember the name of the guy but let me just
[3:02:08.080 --> 3:02:12.960]  give you this information he's trying to open a new investigation from 9 11 william pepper new
[3:02:12.960 --> 3:02:18.560]  york city ballot initiative yes i think his name is mike revel he was running for president on
[3:02:18.560 --> 3:02:23.680]  the democratic side oh no no mike revel is supporting the initiative written up by william
[3:02:23.680 --> 3:02:28.960]  pepper and he should be on democracy now today exactly that's that's where i got the news from
[3:02:28.960 --> 3:02:34.160]  and he got if i don't have the number but all the i encourage all the people from new york who wants
[3:02:34.160 --> 3:02:40.000]  a new investigation 9 11 to check the number of the hotline that he gave on on that show on democracy
[3:02:40.000 --> 3:02:44.880]  now and encourage other just because he needs signatures to open a new investigation a new
[3:02:44.880 --> 3:02:49.760]  commission which i think is very important for all of us believe that you know the shadiness of
[3:02:49.760 --> 3:02:54.400]  i'm with you i think we can get that if we support casinage as well i'm not against the new york
[3:02:54.400 --> 3:02:59.200]  city uh ballot initiative i'm all four by the way but with casinage actually putting up those two
[3:02:59.200 --> 3:03:04.800]  articles of impeachment one obstruction of justice before 9 11 to thwart the investigations into terror
[3:03:04.800 --> 3:03:09.760]  and two covering up the investigation and then of course the third one has to do with the epa's
[3:03:09.760 --> 3:03:15.360]  lies but those two have a lot of teeth and if we're able to push that agenda forward i think
[3:03:15.360 --> 3:03:18.640]  that we were more likely to see some kind of internal investigation i thank you for the
[3:03:18.640 --> 3:03:23.680]  call marco and i thank you for the kind words uh let's go to betty in north carolina betty are you
[3:03:23.680 --> 3:03:32.000]  with us hello hello yes uh jason i did look up at that site as you told me to look up about the
[3:03:32.000 --> 3:03:37.280]  rdf chip okay and i read a lot about it and hearing more about it and the guy that just was on
[3:03:37.280 --> 3:03:41.600]  talking about it and that sets me more and more each time i hear about it because i don't believe
[3:03:41.600 --> 3:03:46.240]  in getting it done because to me that's a mark of the beast well it's a mark of the beast of a
[3:03:46.240 --> 3:03:52.160]  lot of people and even those who aren't religious should realize this is an intrusive radio frequency
[3:03:52.160 --> 3:03:57.680]  identification system that is literally going to hold all of your information on this chip
[3:03:57.680 --> 3:04:02.880]  it's not safe they want us to use it to trade and sell it causes cancer and rats and it's a
[3:04:02.880 --> 3:04:07.280]  total tracking device they've been using it in animals for years and i don't believe in getting
[3:04:07.280 --> 3:04:12.800]  it and i wouldn't do it to my animal but what i wanted to tell you is they were talking yesterday

[3:08:25.040 --> 3:08:30.400]  there that away well i mean they they actually used to show that uh sort of even in a total
[3:08:30.400 --> 3:08:34.320]  recall it's been around for a while an idea and now they're really implementing it shows where
[3:08:34.320 --> 3:08:40.640]  technology is gone i thank you for the call shifting gears we have steward how from we are
[3:08:40.640 --> 3:08:45.840]  change la and uh steward i'm pretty sure that you're the one that interviewed martin sheen

[3:08:52.560 --> 3:08:57.520]  stuff i've watched a lot of youtube videos you are truly one of uh one of the we are changes
[3:08:57.520 --> 3:09:02.320]  that is totally committed and totally involved in this movement and uh i've seen you do everything
[3:09:02.320 --> 3:09:08.720]  from uh highway blogging to you know talking to uh people on the street to posting i mean you're
[3:09:08.720 --> 3:09:14.160]  you're a true patriot man and you show how it's done well thank you brother uh you know
[3:09:14.160 --> 3:09:20.080]  ditto likewise and back atcha i mean i'm i'm inspired and odd by everything that i see you
[3:09:20.080 --> 3:09:25.600]  guys doing well and uh it's amazing it's amazing to be part of it i'm proud to be standing shoulder
[3:09:25.600 --> 3:09:30.160]  shoulder with so many great folks well i mean you guys are really one of the most active groups
[3:09:30.160 --> 3:09:35.280]  out there so so for people listening why don't you tell them how you got started how we are
[3:09:35.280 --> 3:09:39.680]  change has grown and really just just how how much you get together i mean you guys must get together
[3:09:39.680 --> 3:09:47.360]  at least a dozen times a month well so we got started uh we are change la a group of us got
[3:09:47.360 --> 3:09:53.360]  together bruno blue wiler and katie curtsman made some calls uh thinking who they'd want to have
[3:09:53.360 --> 3:09:58.480]  in a kind of a small crew we weren't really happy with the the larger group efforts out here there
[3:09:58.480 --> 3:10:04.640]  was um we just wanted to have something small and tight and we were very inspired by by luke
[3:10:04.640 --> 3:10:10.800]  and alex alex jones and everything going on in the rest of the country and we got together it
[3:10:10.800 --> 3:10:15.440]  started out with eight or nine people and a few have fallen off since then conflicts of interest
[3:10:15.440 --> 3:10:23.440]  in whatnot but uh we did our first project which was the response to bill marr out of the video
[3:10:23.440 --> 3:10:27.520]  and we had fun with that we consciously wanted to have a different tone than we were seeing we
[3:10:27.520 --> 3:10:33.440]  wanted it to be you know we're standing on the truth and we're standing on you know uh the
[3:10:33.440 --> 3:10:38.720]  side right and you know we didn't want to be belligerent and we didn't want to be
[3:10:40.560 --> 3:10:45.360]  uh negative you know we wanted to kind of have some fun with it and and take bill marr's tone
[3:10:45.360 --> 3:10:49.360]  and turn it back at him and that's kind of gotten good response so we've kind of taken
[3:10:49.360 --> 3:10:53.840]  that front with it and we're trying to be as effective as you mentioned on every level that
[3:10:53.840 --> 3:10:58.560]  we can and we're constantly brainstorming with our meetup group which now has over 200 people
[3:10:59.440 --> 3:11:04.320]  and now we're taking inspiration from everywhere and and trying to try to be as effective as we
[3:11:04.320 --> 3:11:08.320]  can well i think you guys are one of the most effective groups and i actually sat down and
[3:11:08.320 --> 3:11:13.680]  had a dinner with both katie and bruno the last time i was in california very nice folks very
[3:11:13.680 --> 3:11:19.040]  effective folks i mean they were able to really pierce the mainstream media with their first action
[3:11:19.040 --> 3:11:25.120]  and uh you know small and large we need these actions to continue and uh you know getting
[3:11:25.120 --> 3:11:30.000]  somebody like martin sheen to talk to the public really does have an effect because unfortunately
[3:11:30.000 --> 3:11:35.680]  more people listen to celebrities than they do architects and engineers scientists you know we
[3:11:35.680 --> 3:11:41.600]  live in this pop culture and that's why i think that truth rising is going to be such a such a uh
[3:11:41.600 --> 3:11:44.800]  i don't even know how to say it it's going to be a big film i think it's going to change a lot of
[3:11:44.800 --> 3:11:49.760]  things i think it's going to motivate people to become uh more like you and me stewart
[3:11:51.520 --> 3:11:55.600]  you so well i hope so and what i've seen of the film the little clip i was able to see
[3:11:56.320 --> 3:12:02.720]  got me very excited and very hopeful and i think uh it's a great representation of what's going on
[3:12:02.720 --> 3:12:09.120]  and a great motivator to get more going on absolutely and you know what's what's going on
[3:12:09.120 --> 3:12:13.440]  with uh we are change la what what can we expect in the near future from this organization
[3:12:13.440 --> 3:12:19.360]  well we've got uh outreach going on we're putting together information packets along
[3:12:19.360 --> 3:12:24.000]  with the truth action and the various change chapters we have a great girl out here named
[3:12:24.000 --> 3:12:30.160]  Cheryl and she's a graphic artist and we've all been rallying uh information and doing research
[3:12:30.160 --> 3:12:35.040]  to put together an information package for outreach to police and military firefighters
[3:12:35.040 --> 3:12:39.760]  so we've got that going on and that's been bolstered by a lot of the real exchange we've had
[3:12:39.760 --> 3:12:46.000]  with the Santa Monica police they seem to be on board with truth and supporting us and we're
[3:12:46.000 --> 3:12:50.080]  trying to to spread that we're trying to take everything positive we can like that and spread
[3:12:50.080 --> 3:12:56.720]  it through our freeway blogging our outreaches through uh actions um i had a talk last night
[3:12:56.720 --> 3:13:02.560]  with warmer white house press secretaries come on at a book signing excellent and we're trying
[3:13:02.560 --> 3:13:08.320]  to talk with people and we're trying to put a different a little bit differently uh flavored
[3:13:08.320 --> 3:13:13.360]  but forward and certainly you know there's a lot of times when when loud and in your face and a
[3:13:13.360 --> 3:13:19.040]  bull is appropriate on that note it was excellent to be able to stand with everybody at uh builder
[3:13:20.000 --> 3:13:24.400]  that's right you were at Bilderberg this year as well yeah but i brought one of our big blue
[3:13:24.400 --> 3:13:29.040]  banners and uh alex liked it it was pretty well and it was great to know that a lot of these
[3:13:29.040 --> 3:13:34.960]  these scoundrel traders as they were driving in saw 20 by five foot banners saying 9 11 equals
[3:13:34.960 --> 3:13:40.560]  controlled demolition uh you know it's like we're on to you the cats out of the bag and uh the
[3:13:40.560 --> 3:13:46.000]  cats not going back in the bag so be advised absolutely and the way you were speaking towards
[3:13:46.000 --> 3:13:50.080]  you know a different tone i'm all with you and that's why i love these different organizations
[3:13:50.080 --> 3:13:55.600]  like i i love student scholars for 9 11 truth approach uh you know when i get to confront somebody
[3:13:55.600 --> 3:14:00.480]  i'm usually i i try to ask them a couple softball questions you know kind of ease them into it and
[3:14:00.480 --> 3:14:05.040]  then ask them really tough ones you know try to relate relate to them on a uh different level
[3:14:05.040 --> 3:14:10.640]  there certainly is that time when they're meeting in private you know in an organization of a hundred
[3:14:10.640 --> 3:14:16.320]  and fifty uh 40 of you know the world elite that are deciding our fates to bullhorn these people
[3:14:16.320 --> 3:14:20.960]  you know that that is the time to disrupt things but at the same time you know there is a time
[3:14:20.960 --> 3:14:25.920]  where i mean look at look at lucredowski's confrontation with uh viscente fox you know
[3:14:25.920 --> 3:14:30.800]  all that's one of my favorites worthy of the worthy of the pure surprise in my opinion that was
[3:14:31.440 --> 3:14:37.520]  that was i just uh watched that with the slack jaw in awe of luc and with what was accomplished
[3:14:37.520 --> 3:14:45.040]  just you know in a calm peaceful friendly manner uh i mean it was just amazing to see that and
[3:14:45.040 --> 3:14:48.800]  that's something that i took a lot of inspiration i think a lot of us took inspiration from that as
[3:14:48.800 --> 3:14:53.120]  well absolutely and now that's going to be seen on a much more massive scale because if you look
[3:14:53.120 --> 3:14:58.080]  at some of these youtube videos yeah they have five or ten thousand hits but you know if alex
[3:14:58.080 --> 3:15:03.440]  jones is able to move five or ten thousand dvds uh you know that means that there's going to be
[3:15:03.440 --> 3:15:07.440]  fifty to a hundred thousand of those dvds really out there because people are going to make copies
[3:15:07.440 --> 3:15:11.280]  and we're going to reach so many people people that aren't on the internet people that don't
[3:15:11.280 --> 3:15:17.040]  visit info wars dot com prison planet dot com or nine eleven blogger dot com and hopefully we can
[3:15:17.040 --> 3:15:24.080]  direct them to we are change dot org and get them involved and and that's what the goal is exactly
[3:15:24.080 --> 3:15:28.160]  and and thank you for bringing that up because that seems to be the our next area of focus is
[3:15:28.160 --> 3:15:33.440]  in we are change la and i guess in general is those hundreds of thousands if not millions
[3:15:33.440 --> 3:15:38.320]  hundreds of millions now people in america that uh he's questioned the official story or are on
[3:15:38.320 --> 3:15:44.000]  to the fact that it was an inside job for a agenda a agenda that's being hidden from us
[3:15:44.000 --> 3:15:49.760]  is how to get that transferred from howling to doing and how to get people to join us and
[3:15:49.760 --> 3:15:54.480]  stand with us and that's the exciting thing about films like alex's new film
[3:15:54.480 --> 3:15:58.480]  truth rising and that's what we know we're trying to make it an attractive movement
[3:15:58.480 --> 3:16:05.040]  uh by commend abby martin who was a whole surprise to see a bill berg with her her outreach in the
[3:16:05.040 --> 3:16:10.160]  cooter dot org is putting a a good face you know putting an attractive face on it and
[3:16:10.160 --> 3:16:15.840]  and uh while i'm on the subject if anybody were to go to our new website we have a brand new website
[3:16:15.840 --> 3:16:24.160]  wacla.org for our change la but it's wacla.org and we've got a lot of projects and a lot of
[3:16:24.160 --> 3:16:28.640]  things coming up where we're you know we're inviting people to come out because just knowing
[3:16:28.640 --> 3:16:34.960]  doesn't really accomplish what actually having the people out and active uh you know is going
[3:16:34.960 --> 3:16:40.400]  to accomplish and we'll continue to gain and well it's that process of educating and then
[3:16:40.400 --> 3:16:45.600]  activating and what we're hoping to do is all those people that always complain i'm just one person
[3:16:46.160 --> 3:16:50.480]  i can't make a difference lead me in the right direction hopefully this movie's gonna say hey
[3:16:50.480 --> 3:16:55.360]  here it is anybody can do it look at this 20 year old kid you know he's out there he's doing it
[3:16:55.360 --> 3:16:59.760]  look at this group that came out of nowhere they're out there they're doing it look what mark
[3:16:59.760 --> 3:17:05.600]  dice was able to accomplish abby's in the field i mean it's it's just unbelievable that you know
[3:17:05.600 --> 3:17:09.520]  they've tried to marginalize this movement i remember on the fifth anniversary of 9 11 when
[3:17:09.520 --> 3:17:13.520]  we were out there with literally thousands of people the mainstream media totally ignored us
[3:17:13.520 --> 3:17:17.120]  they kept the shots within the pit so they didn't have to show how many people actually had to
[3:17:17.120 --> 3:17:24.080]  investigate 9 11 shirt on was and then when the one media uh personality covered it it was glenbeck
[3:17:24.080 --> 3:17:29.120]  and he said it was hundreds not thousands and he canceled our appearance on the show uh we were
[3:17:29.120 --> 3:17:33.120]  supposed to go against popular mechanics that day and i had already gone up against them on
[3:17:33.120 --> 3:17:37.440]  democracy now earlier and they cancelled us straight up they didn't want an opposition party
[3:17:37.440 --> 3:17:43.200]  so again that shows the mainstream media is not going to give us our due uh time our say we have
[3:17:43.200 --> 3:17:48.720]  to make them hear us yeah and that's uh that's why we focused our first project however we're
[3:17:48.720 --> 3:17:54.480]  continuing to find projects that can break through the media blockade the blackout uh with the bill
[3:17:54.480 --> 3:17:59.440]  marr incidents with um you know other things we've done with trying to get more celebrities to come
[3:17:59.440 --> 3:18:05.520]  out because that that accomplishes what you point to as being important is getting through
[3:18:06.240 --> 3:18:12.240]  the blackout in the blockade uh because once people become aware that there is a huge amount of
[3:18:12.240 --> 3:18:18.880]  great people that have the same concerns that they do and are active their their start motivating
[3:18:18.880 --> 3:18:23.760]  towards being active like hey i want to be part of that so that's how it happened for me i saw
[3:18:23.760 --> 3:18:31.040]  i saw youtube clips and i saw you know bits of luke and all kinds of great people actually speaking
[3:18:31.040 --> 3:18:36.800]  up and actually uh accomplishing things with organizations and groups and i went into you
[3:18:36.800 --> 3:18:41.680]  know got together with some people and it's been a wild ride ever since i can tell you that a
[3:18:41.680 --> 3:18:47.120]  wonderful wild ride absolutely and that's another thing you know yes a lot of this information is
[3:18:47.120 --> 3:18:53.200]  depressing uh it's tough to to handle i mean it's not happy fun stuff but that doesn't mean
[3:18:53.200 --> 3:18:56.960]  that it should bring your life down this stuff's going to be going on whether or not you're
[3:18:56.960 --> 3:19:02.720]  depressed about it and i always find it's more positive to think you know i can change this
[3:19:02.720 --> 3:19:07.360]  and i have to share this and that's not going to make my life all about doom and gloom i mean
[3:19:07.360 --> 3:19:12.880]  we have to report that you know this weekend there was an attack on a prison in afghanistan they said
[3:19:12.880 --> 3:19:17.280]  a thousand militants were let go they said 400 of them were taliban and then on monday they say the
[3:19:17.280 --> 3:19:22.320]  talibans back in afghanistan they're taking over again and then late monday they admit the us helped
[3:19:22.320 --> 3:19:27.760]  attack the prison to let them go these things need to be exposed more with we are change la

[3:24:34.080 --> 3:24:42.400]  and prisonplanet.com and steward i really do see a huge breakthrough and i i gotta agree with you i
[3:24:42.400 --> 3:24:47.920]  think that we should focus on getting more celebrities to talk and you know roseo donnell
[3:24:47.920 --> 3:24:52.880]  recently on howard stern i thought was great because now we have two uh legitimate people
[3:24:52.880 --> 3:24:57.840]  talking about nine eleven being an inside job on stern without being interrupted or made fun of too
[3:24:57.840 --> 3:25:02.880]  much uh you got jesse ventura and roseo donnell but the thing about odonnell that interests me is
[3:25:02.880 --> 3:25:07.920]  he's offered her a show and i would love to see her on serious radio where she can get away with
[3:25:07.920 --> 3:25:14.240]  a little bit more uh to do a show and to have some nine eleven truthers on and make that a big part
[3:25:14.240 --> 3:25:18.960]  of her show you know maybe cover it once or twice a week even or some real news i really think she
[3:25:18.960 --> 3:25:25.280]  could be a huge voice in this movement if she wanted to i think so too i agree with you and i
[3:25:25.280 --> 3:25:29.760]  think we're on the verge of a tipping point with all the celebrities that have come out recently
[3:25:30.480 --> 3:25:35.920]  with jesse ventura you know certainly is as credible as you can get with his background
[3:25:35.920 --> 3:25:43.040]  as a navy seal i think we're going to see the feeling of more solidarity in hollywood and
[3:25:43.040 --> 3:25:48.800]  in the celebrity community to be able to come out and be a force for change you know
[3:25:48.800 --> 3:25:54.640]  to pay back a bit to the country and society uh and even the town that these people have
[3:25:54.640 --> 3:25:59.520]  done so well in and so we're encouraging that we're working on some things with some people
[3:25:59.520 --> 3:26:06.640]  i know alex is as well and i i think there really is a huge amount of benefit uh from
[3:26:06.640 --> 3:26:11.760]  celebrities coming out and and that's uh that's an exciting thing because a lot of these people
[3:26:11.760 --> 3:26:16.560]  are really good folks they are just waiting to know that they're not going to be hung out to dry
[3:26:16.560 --> 3:26:24.000]  and and demonize to a certain degree like they've been done but now that there's more people coming
[3:26:24.000 --> 3:26:30.320]  on board and a warmer response to to some of them i think they're starting to sense the solidarity
[3:26:30.320 --> 3:26:36.560]  that will empower them to in a group or individually come forward and we are change la is is here to
[3:26:36.560 --> 3:26:41.600]  do that to facilitate that uh you know along with everybody in the movement absolutely and and the
[3:26:41.600 --> 3:26:46.720]  american public loves products that are pushed by celebrities period amen i mean you know roseo
[3:26:46.720 --> 3:26:52.640]  donnell used to push kmart uh you know people push things on television and we find ourselves
[3:26:52.640 --> 3:26:59.440]  buying these brands because you know michael jordan and nike or hey i mean i mean he's still around so
[3:26:59.440 --> 3:27:03.920]  you know they brand it a certain way and i think it'll open up people's minds even further and
[3:27:03.920 --> 3:27:08.240]  maybe it opened up opens up enough minds that they're like okay maybe this isn't the life i
[3:27:08.240 --> 3:27:13.120]  should be leading maybe i shouldn't care so much about the sports team maybe the style car i have
[3:27:13.120 --> 3:27:18.480]  isn't that important maybe what's important is the legislation being passed to take away my my
[3:27:18.480 --> 3:27:23.280]  rights as an american citizen you know to take away my civil liberties maybe i should be paying
[3:27:23.280 --> 3:27:28.880]  paying attention to kasinich uh you know impeaching the president under 35 separate articles i mean
[3:27:28.880 --> 3:27:35.040]  this is unprecedented let's get your take on uh the kasinich impeachment well i feel i've been
[3:27:35.040 --> 3:27:40.480]  focused on other things uh but certainly any effort to hold these people accountable these
[3:27:40.480 --> 3:27:46.160]  scoundrels that need to be held accountable uh as does the larger picture and i've been primarily
[3:27:46.160 --> 3:27:53.120]  focused on the larger picture because the way i see it to a degree uh taking out bush cheney
[3:27:53.120 --> 3:27:57.760]  taking out any of these individuals is like pulling teeth out of a great white shark and
[3:27:57.760 --> 3:28:03.680]  then expecting to be safe in the water with it what is just missing a couple of teeth and uh i
[3:28:03.680 --> 3:28:11.520]  you know i i am all behind impeachment uh and and every level of accountability but i'd like to not
[3:28:11.520 --> 3:28:17.840]  see any energy taken away from exposing the true nature of the real threat which is the power behind
[3:28:17.840 --> 3:28:26.640]  the throne the bill berg factor if you will and the larger agenda that transcends a regime or
[3:28:27.280 --> 3:28:32.240]  you know or an executive branch no i'm with you you know what we had paul craig robertson earlier
[3:28:32.240 --> 3:28:36.480]  and he just he's still one of those right and left guys he does a lot of great stuff writes for
[3:28:36.480 --> 3:28:41.680]  counter punch but you know with all the evils of obama he's still pushing obama because he thinks
[3:28:41.680 --> 3:28:45.280]  that the democrats will do less evil and i'm just like you know i brought up the builder
[3:28:45.280 --> 3:28:48.880]  berg group and i brought up the fact that he probably met with them and that he had these
[3:28:48.880 --> 3:28:53.360]  secret meetings with hillary and he kind of just thought that that was like you know political
[3:28:53.360 --> 3:28:59.840]  positioning i still think that you know he was in washington a long time and i i just i i believe
[3:28:59.840 --> 3:29:05.280]  it's just very very difficult for someone like that to wrap their head around the fact that
[3:29:05.280 --> 3:29:09.600]  you know these people are are working together against us give out the website one more time
[3:29:09.600 --> 3:29:17.600]  steward and i thank you for your time my pleasure is wacla.org and we've got the brunos going to

[3:37:33.040 --> 3:37:39.280]  yes i'm here what's on your mind well first of all props for all you've done jason proper well thank
[3:37:39.280 --> 3:37:45.840]  you all about getting attention i think that we should build on the ideas by the farmers in 95
[3:37:45.840 --> 3:37:52.480]  and by the truckers in italy this year and start to have drive by protesting or drive
[3:37:52.480 --> 3:37:58.000]  through or drive past or drive slowly or tourism protesting whatever you want to call it but the
[3:37:58.000 --> 3:38:04.240]  idea being that they it's harder to tear gas you in a car it's harder to water cannon you in a car
[3:38:04.240 --> 3:38:10.720]  you can bring a peanuts and a radio and in a cell phone and and just drive around and be a tourist
[3:38:10.720 --> 3:38:15.040]  well there's been a there's been a couple people that have kind of taken that idea uh most notably
[3:38:15.040 --> 3:38:20.480]  probably the granny warriors who had the ron paul van with america freedom to fascism huge on the
[3:38:20.480 --> 3:38:25.840]  side but then also the ron paul limousine where they got a limo painted up like ron paul the biggest
[3:38:25.840 --> 3:38:31.040]  limousine in the world and drove it across the country now if we could organize and get 10 20
[3:38:31.040 --> 3:38:37.840]  people you know to get into 5 10 cars and highway blog freeway blog just drive around the block kind
[3:38:37.840 --> 3:38:43.280]  of like uh you know i'm thinking more like 5000 people's around well i'd love to see that i hey
[3:38:43.280 --> 3:38:46.960]  i'd love to see that and i and i hope that we can put that together but i know the truckers
[3:38:46.960 --> 3:38:52.160]  already tried to do something in dc i think it was like two three weeks ago where they tried to
[3:38:52.160 --> 3:38:57.760]  just have this huge uh you know trucker i think they had a couple thousand there and they shut
[3:38:57.760 --> 3:39:02.560]  down in dc and they tried to stop the roadways but it just didn't happen and it didn't get media
[3:39:02.560 --> 3:39:06.640]  attention not that i'm expecting to get media attention i mean unfortunately the mainstream
[3:39:06.640 --> 3:39:12.080]  media is going to do everything they can to try to put this movement into the dark i mean i literally
[3:39:12.080 --> 3:39:19.040]  found out from erin uh last week that in 2006 somebody had actually burned themselves to death
[3:39:19.040 --> 3:39:25.200]  in protest of the iraq war in this country he actually lit himself on fire and killed himself
[3:39:25.200 --> 3:39:31.520]  in protest and it got zero media coverage that's serious man i thank you for the call i that is
[3:39:31.520 --> 3:39:36.240]  a good idea i mean i let put up the website try to organize it let's get as many people involved
[3:39:36.240 --> 3:39:42.080]  as possible let's go to mike in indiana mike are you with us yeah how you doing jason good man
[3:39:42.080 --> 3:39:47.360]  what's on your mind well i'm just uh you know want to let everybody know there is a huge i'm sure
[3:39:47.360 --> 3:39:54.400]  you know most people do know but a huge um amount of people on the internet that is busy with the
[3:39:54.400 --> 3:40:00.080]  nine and eleven truth movement i uh came across some people two years ago i've been a nine eleven
[3:40:00.080 --> 3:40:05.840]  truth for now for two years um we are very active every night trying to organize things
[3:40:06.400 --> 3:40:11.360]  we're all around the world um we're trying to organize things in our in our own towns in our
[3:40:11.360 --> 3:40:16.880]  own cities here in the united states and around the world um the one thing the one comment i just
[3:40:16.880 --> 3:40:22.960]  want to make that comment there but i do have one question the thing that does scare me is the fact
[3:40:22.960 --> 3:40:28.640]  that we're out here doing everything we seem to be able to do jason we had how do we get these people
[3:40:28.640 --> 3:40:34.800]  out of office that are going against the war with iran and just like the bill to bergs are in uh
[3:40:34.800 --> 3:40:42.640]  virginia how do we get those people out of power well their power structure relies on us being
[3:40:42.640 --> 3:40:47.520]  docile the first thing we need to do is we need to infiltrate our local governments we need to
[3:40:47.520 --> 3:40:52.400]  become state senators we need to become congressmen okay i mean that's the first step
[3:40:52.400 --> 3:40:56.960]  governmentally to try to get this country back otherwise i don't know how we're going to do it
[3:40:56.960 --> 3:41:01.200]  i mean honestly i don't think that any kind of violence is going to solve anything i mean the
[3:41:01.200 --> 3:41:05.600]  guns that these have not not that we shouldn't resist if we're being attacked but there's no
[3:41:05.600 --> 3:41:11.040]  there's no offensive that we're going to win that's period amen and it may take a generation we may
[3:41:11.040 --> 3:41:15.600]  just have to instill this into the youth because i think the youth are really the majority of who
[3:41:15.600 --> 3:41:20.960]  are responding i mean i think that if we get it into their heads maybe they can make the difference
[3:41:20.960 --> 3:41:26.320]  that our generation made uh in the civil rights movement i mean racism although still existing
[3:41:26.320 --> 3:41:32.320]  in this country is a lot better than it was when i was a little kid 20 years ago i can tell you that
[3:41:32.320 --> 3:41:38.080]  and maybe we can build a consciousness that it's cool to know about government again it's cool to
[3:41:38.080 --> 3:41:43.920]  be involved in local politics instead of this society where it's cool to not know anything but the
[3:41:43.920 --> 3:41:50.000]  latest hippest tv show or about the latest movie and about the latest fashion sense do i know how
[3:41:50.000 --> 3:41:54.720]  exactly how we're going to do it no but i really feel like you know this is the digital age this is
[3:41:54.720 --> 3:41:59.600]  the video age we need people who know how to make movies to continue to make movies and spread this
[3:41:59.600 --> 3:42:03.920]  stuff out i think that's the only way we're going to penetrate the mainstream and uh you know it's
[3:42:03.920 --> 3:42:08.480]  it's through activism it's through becoming the local government and becoming the media
[3:42:08.480 --> 3:42:12.960]  that we're going to be able to do this that's that's what i think man all right i appreciate it
[3:42:12.960 --> 3:42:17.680]  you got it mike thanks for the call all right let's go to grant in british columbia grant are you
[3:42:17.680 --> 3:42:24.560]  there hey jason i finally got through i just want to share that i'm plugging away the truth on craigslist
[3:42:24.560 --> 3:42:28.720]  it's it's all a lot of fun you know it's up there for five minutes and it's taken down
[3:42:30.080 --> 3:42:34.000]  they like to take a lot of posts down over at craigslist i know they do but anyway
[3:42:34.000 --> 3:42:41.360]  another thing is i'm calling from whistler british columbia canada home of the 2010 winter olympics
[3:42:41.360 --> 3:42:48.480]  okay a home where homes where you cannot buy a house for less 1.3 million and these homes
[3:42:48.480 --> 3:42:55.760]  sit empty well it doesn't shock me i mean you know for the year and i just wonder if you could comment
[3:42:55.760 --> 3:43:01.120]  on what the olympics are all about well yeah we actually have a big post i think over at jones
[3:43:01.120 --> 3:43:08.720]  report of the olympics when they were held by uh hitler over in uh over in germany and nazi germany
[3:43:08.720 --> 3:43:14.080]  folks they had the olympics over there hitler actually came up with the symbolism for the olympics
[3:43:14.080 --> 3:43:19.440]  the circles the intricate circles there are all him and it really is an occultic ceremony i'm
[3:43:19.440 --> 3:43:24.560]  sorry to tell y'all it's an occultic ceremony uh if you watch this thing it's all about the torch
[3:43:24.560 --> 3:43:29.120]  and the light and they align it with the sun and this year i thought it was interesting someone did
[3:43:29.680 --> 3:43:33.840]  email me this and like i said i read all the emails that you send over to myspace.com
[3:43:33.840 --> 3:43:42.000]  slash jason bermas uh he said you know the olympics are august eighth uh oh eight this year eight eight
[3:43:42.000 --> 3:43:48.880]  oh eight and they're actually going to be kicking off the ceremony at 808 a.m after eight seconds
[3:43:49.520 --> 3:43:54.320]  so that's very bizarre to me and he also pointed out that the eight is the symbol for infinity
[3:43:54.320 --> 3:43:58.560]  so there's a there's a lot of uh pagan occultic stuff these guys are into that man they're into
[3:43:58.560 --> 3:44:05.680]  the star alignment they're into i mean even ronald reagan's wife was huge huge into astrology
[3:44:05.680 --> 3:44:11.360]  i know she would base his meetings around you know what was in the stars that day so unfortunately
[3:44:11.360 --> 3:44:16.320]  these people believe in the occult you know hitler thought he had great power from the symbols from
[3:44:16.320 --> 3:44:21.680]  the ss and from his son logo the swastika he really thought he had his great power from this
[3:44:21.680 --> 3:44:26.320]  and he had an occultic advisor this is all on the history channel actually the history channel one
[3:44:26.320 --> 3:44:30.640]  is good it's like an hour long but you can get like the three hour dvd that really delves into
[3:44:30.640 --> 3:44:34.960]  the occultic nature and the symbolism of the nazis but that's only continued you know anybody who
[3:44:34.960 --> 3:44:40.720]  does their research finds out that the bush family you know made their fortune from nazi money i mean
[3:44:40.720 --> 3:44:47.360]  literally i mean how crazy is that so you know i hope i broke it down for you enough man and uh
[3:44:47.360 --> 3:44:52.880]  god knows what they're going to try to pull up up cut on jason oh keep on keeping on and uh good
[3:44:52.880 --> 3:44:58.240]  luck to you guys all right i i think we just fixed that problem i don't know what happened there but
[3:44:58.240 --> 3:45:05.440]  boy that was uh rough all right let's take some more callers let's go to uh kyle in massachusetts
[3:45:05.440 --> 3:45:15.920]  kyle you're there you're there kyle uh yes sir what's on your mind i was just uh i wanted to
[3:45:15.920 --> 3:45:22.000]  thank you guys for getting uh getting some truth out there and uh i wanted to talk about are you
[3:45:22.000 --> 3:45:29.120]  guys up to the speed on that article about that fellow in philadelphia about the uh freedom he was
[3:45:29.120 --> 3:45:33.680]  preaching we're trying to rock them up on the park yep absolutely there's a yeah there's a story
[3:45:33.680 --> 3:45:38.560]  about that on info wars dot com that we's talking about is that apparently it's a free speech speech
[3:45:38.560 --> 3:45:43.760]  zone uh where he was talking about uh you know he's basically preaching he's a preacher out in front
[3:45:43.760 --> 3:45:48.240]  of the uh liberty bell and they arrested him for we're going to try to get him on actually uh on
[3:45:48.240 --> 3:45:53.760]  the project called him i left him a message to call me but i also um is this the alex jones show
[3:45:53.760 --> 3:45:58.000]  at this time or this week we are changed no no this is uh this is absolutely the alex jones
[3:45:58.000 --> 3:46:01.840]  show i'm just subbing in for the week and i'm not even you know one of the we are changers i'm one
[3:46:01.840 --> 3:46:06.240]  of the guys that put together loose change but uh i love the we are change guys and uh we had a
[3:46:06.240 --> 3:46:11.840]  couple of them on today yeah i think it's a it's a boxing war and the guys over the liberty bell
[3:46:11.840 --> 3:46:17.280]  preaching the bible and they're arresting him that's where our country's heading yeah absolutely well
[3:46:17.280 --> 3:46:20.880]  you know there is no free speech in this country you know we don't even have a fourth amendment
[3:46:20.880 --> 3:46:25.440]  apparently we're not free in our persons and property anymore it's just another tale of the
[3:46:25.440 --> 3:46:31.120]  police state i thank you for the call kyle uh let's go to renae in north carolina renae are you
[3:46:31.120 --> 3:46:38.560]  with us hello you're doing a great job jason well thank you um listen um you know i try to engage
[3:46:40.080 --> 3:46:45.680]  public officials mayor's office police department or whatever in conversation wherever i can
[3:46:45.680 --> 3:46:53.120]  and i'll tell you they must have huge jars of blue pills from the matrix in all government offices
[3:46:53.120 --> 3:47:00.400]  because i'd rather reason with a drunk or a drug addict desperately in need for a fix well they are
[3:47:00.400 --> 3:47:05.280]  often drunks and drug addicts but that's beside you that's besides the point they have a double
[3:47:05.280 --> 3:47:08.640]  addiction that's absolutely true well you know what you need to do you need to say if you're
[3:47:08.640 --> 3:47:13.520]  gonna keep ignoring me i'm taking your job i mean that's what ventura did and i know that that's not
[3:47:13.520 --> 3:47:18.240]  an easy thing to do and it's a big commitment and a lot of us have lives outside of this and we
[3:47:18.240 --> 3:47:22.960]  have jobs and we have people to take care of but if they're gonna keep ignoring you yeah you have to
[3:47:22.960 --> 3:47:27.840]  say well you know what i'm from this district too and i know you've had this cushy job you've been
[3:47:27.840 --> 3:47:31.840]  in this position or elected five or six times i think it's time for a change because i'm gonna
[3:47:31.840 --> 3:47:36.320]  i'm gonna do something about these issues and if we had people all throughout the country
[3:47:36.320 --> 3:47:41.280]  that wanted to do that you know problems might but be fixed tomorrow it's it's gonna be a long road
[3:47:41.280 --> 3:47:45.360]  because people just aren't convinced that they have the power to win that type of an election
[3:47:45.360 --> 3:47:49.120]  but you know i encourage you to keep trying to inform them it's just unfortunately you're right
[3:47:49.120 --> 3:47:54.160]  it it often falls on deaf ears doesn't it well yeah because they're they want to you know everybody
[3:47:54.160 --> 3:47:59.040]  wants to feel good about themselves even if they have to lie to themselves to do it and basically
[3:47:59.040 --> 3:48:06.320]  these people's job is being overseer on the government plantation and nobody wants to really
[3:48:06.320 --> 3:48:15.040]  know that they're taking money to be the overseer on the plantation who wants to do that so they're
[3:48:15.040 --> 3:48:22.080]  more than happy to take the blue pill so they can be happily delusional believing they're really
[3:48:22.080 --> 3:48:28.160]  good guys and and believing what they want to believe yeah we all have our own realities i got
[3:48:28.160 --> 3:48:32.720]  to agree with you there and people often prop themselves up as more important than others
[3:48:32.720 --> 3:48:38.000]  and put themselves in authority uh positions to feel that power and that's that's who gravitates
[3:48:38.000 --> 3:48:42.960]  to these things mostly and again that's why we need to become the local government and then
[3:48:42.960 --> 3:48:49.200]  hopefully you know the federal government a four and by the people establishment like we tried
[3:48:49.200 --> 3:48:52.720]  you know in the 1700s i thank you for the call think about it the government four and by the
[3:48:52.720 --> 3:48:58.880]  people one more time together again for the very first time folks us in liberty uh us in the
[3:48:58.880 --> 3:49:05.120]  constitution i dream of it i dream of it all right let's go to arthur in kansas arthur are you there
[3:49:05.120 --> 3:49:10.960]  hello jason how you doing uh i'm wondering if anybody could check out michael rake and's birth
[3:49:10.960 --> 3:49:18.000]  family for insanity you we we'd have to dig into that i think that's a good idea let's get to the
[3:49:18.000 --> 3:49:24.480]  family tree or maybe ask some kind of defection or what about dna you know what i gotta i gotta say
[3:49:24.480 --> 3:49:29.520]  though he might even i i don't think his birth mother and father can be held accountable i think
[3:49:29.520 --> 3:49:34.800]  it's probably the reagan brainwashing you know i i think it's probably again this kid he's not a
[3:49:34.800 --> 3:49:41.280]  kid but when he was a kid i'm sure he was spoiled rotten yeah yeah but still it could be there in
[3:49:41.280 --> 3:49:48.880]  the genes someplace sorry i lost you there for a second i don't know what's i don't know what's
[3:49:48.880 --> 3:49:52.240]  going on here but that's the second time i've had that happen and thank god it's almost the end of
[3:49:52.240 --> 3:49:57.360]  the show i just said it could be in the gene someplace that you know i i gotta say that i think this
[3:49:57.360 --> 3:50:05.280]  one in in nature versus nurture this one is nurture okay and uh i i just don't know i mean i i think
[3:50:05.280 --> 3:50:10.640]  it's the environment this kid probably grew up spoiled raw in above the law had access like you
[3:50:10.640 --> 3:50:15.600]  wouldn't believe to just about everybody i'm sure he's met a ton of celebrities in his day he's just
[3:50:15.600 --> 3:50:20.880]  not in he's an indelusional mindset he's probably on a payroll somewhere arthur i thank you for the
[3:50:20.880 --> 3:50:25.920]  call we're gonna take your calls at the very end here it's the alex jones show we'll be back after this

[3:55:26.640 --> 3:55:33.360]  911 truth lot and if people don't know the way that these uh stations finance themselves is you
[3:55:33.360 --> 3:55:38.960]  know it depends on how much it depends on how much each show pulls in and so a lot of people
[3:55:38.960 --> 3:55:44.480]  a lot could donate uh i did last week to this show it would send a message to the station
[3:55:44.480 --> 3:55:49.600]  give out the show one more time oh uh wait say it again what was the show again one more time

[3:56:03.520 --> 3:56:09.440]  lisa are you there hi yes great great show jason well thank you real quickly i mean
[3:56:09.440 --> 3:56:17.760]  i mean do you fear i mean that possibly there's going to be some kind of event that's going to
[3:56:17.760 --> 3:56:22.960]  call you all the time i well you know i i've got to tell you i i hope they don't all will be
[3:56:22.960 --> 3:56:28.480]  instated it seems to me that that's it's a possibility but come on let's be honest here
[3:56:28.480 --> 3:56:33.360]  they've been exposed at such a high level for 911 alone in this country i think it's going to be
[3:56:33.360 --> 3:56:38.880]  tough for them to pull off any high-scale event in this country but i mean look they're drilling
[3:56:38.880 --> 3:56:45.120]  for a dirty bomb over at the dnc and can you imagine if they sacrificed some of our democratic
[3:56:45.120 --> 3:56:49.920]  leaders can you imagine how quick martial law really would come into existence so it is a fear
[3:56:50.720 --> 3:56:55.680]  but i you know i still shouldn't stop anybody from from moving in the direction that you're
[3:56:55.680 --> 3:57:02.720]  moving exactly exactly and uh you know it's always a fear i mean i think that they pulled off 77
[3:57:02.720 --> 3:57:06.400]  across seas again because the information was just too hot here i don't think it would have
[3:57:06.400 --> 3:57:12.560]  flown here absolutely i agree with i i agree with all of that i'm there's no doubt in my mind in fact
