[00:00.000 --> 00:11.840]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going
[00:11.840 --> 00:17.440]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe you've got one!
[00:17.440 --> 00:32.440]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:32.440 --> 00:38.720]  This week nearly 3,000 delegates of the National People's Congress met to hear reports of the
[00:38.720 --> 00:41.280]  Communist Party's priorities.
[00:41.280 --> 00:46.960]  A year after ceremonially being reaffirmed as their leader, Xi Jinping accused western
[00:46.960 --> 00:52.640]  governments led by the United States of trying to encircle and suppress China's progress
[00:52.640 --> 00:58.520]  as a nation, quote, Western countries led by the United States have implemented all around
[00:58.520 --> 01:04.360]  containment encirclement and suppression of China, which has brought unprecedented grave
[01:04.360 --> 01:07.040]  challenges to our nation's development.
[01:07.040 --> 01:14.600]  To the 3,000 delegates, Xi called on them to, quote, remain calm, maintain concentration,
[01:14.600 --> 01:21.600]  strive for progress while maintaining stability, take active actions united as one, and dare
[01:21.600 --> 01:22.600]  to fight.
[01:22.600 --> 01:23.840]  Dare to fight?
[01:23.840 --> 01:26.000]  What does he mean by that exactly?
[01:26.000 --> 01:31.800]  Chinese Foreign Minister, Qin Gang, elaborated on these grievances laid out by the president,
[01:31.800 --> 01:38.400]  claiming that Washington has, quote, entirely deviated from the rational and sound track,
[01:38.400 --> 01:43.480]  adding that, quote, if the United States does not hit the break, but continues to speed
[01:43.480 --> 01:49.920]  down the wrong path, no amount of guardrails can prevent derailing, and there surely will
[01:49.920 --> 01:52.400]  be conflict and confrontation.
[01:52.400 --> 01:57.320]  Clearly, China is warning of war with the United States and is announcing to their
[01:57.320 --> 02:02.680]  political leaders that they are preparing for physical combat, revitalized discussions
[02:02.680 --> 02:08.840]  in the U.S. of the Wuhan-Lablik origin of COVID have caused concern in the foreign ministry
[02:08.840 --> 02:15.280]  as well, and they accused the United States of politicizing the issue to discredit China.
[02:15.280 --> 02:19.120]  But will they really go to war over COVID's origin?
[02:19.120 --> 02:23.040]  What is it that China really cares about in relation to the West?
[02:23.040 --> 02:30.360]  Well, Qin Gang called Taiwan the first red line that must not be crossed to avoid war,
[02:30.360 --> 02:35.640]  and even criticized Washington for shooting down the Chinese spy balloon, calling its
[02:35.640 --> 02:38.000]  appearance an accident.
[02:38.000 --> 02:43.200]  Accident or surveillance operation, the spy balloon still caused Anthony Blinken to cancel
[02:43.200 --> 02:45.680]  his visit to Beijing in February.
[02:45.680 --> 02:51.840]  On Taiwan, Gang stated, quote, the U.S. has unshakable responsibility for causing the
[02:51.840 --> 02:58.960]  Taiwan question, accusing the U.S. of, quote, disrespecting China's sovereignty and territorial
[02:58.960 --> 02:59.960]  integrity.
[02:59.960 --> 03:05.360]  Probably the most consequential part of Qin Gang's speech was his direct comparison
[03:05.360 --> 03:11.200]  of the situation in Taiwan with the Ukraine question in relation to Russia, quote, why
[03:11.200 --> 03:17.160]  does the U.S. ask China not to provide weapons to Russia, while it keeps selling arms to
[03:17.160 --> 03:18.160]  Taiwan?
[03:18.160 --> 03:19.920]  Honestly, a fair question.
[03:19.920 --> 03:25.600]  He also observes, quote, there seems to be an invisible hand pushing for the protraction
[03:25.600 --> 03:31.600]  and escalation of the conflict, and using the Ukraine crisis to serve a certain geopolitical
[03:31.600 --> 03:32.600]  agenda.
[03:32.600 --> 03:35.800]  Again, he couldn't be more accurate with his assessment.
[03:35.800 --> 03:41.560]  China has accused the U.S. of fanning the flames of war by providing Ukraine with weaponry
[03:41.560 --> 03:43.280]  to fight Russian invasion.
[03:43.280 --> 03:49.240]  Yet, the U.S. wants to limit China's activity with Russia, although China touts their own
[03:49.240 --> 03:52.200]  no-limits friendship with their northern neighbors.
[03:52.200 --> 03:58.320]  So will Ukraine's conflict with Russia and Taiwan's conflict with China be the ultimate
[03:58.320 --> 04:02.760]  triggers to start a new world war of epic proportions?
[04:02.760 --> 04:08.000]  The non-interventionist approach to foreign affairs used to be an all-American point
[04:08.000 --> 04:10.760]  of view and practice on the world stage.
[04:10.760 --> 04:17.040]  Now, as the United States morphs into an empire, the military arm of the new world order, it
[04:17.040 --> 04:22.680]  seems we will be dragged kicking and screaming into other nations' wars, shedding our life
[04:22.680 --> 04:25.800]  blood on the soil of faraway lands.
[04:25.800 --> 04:32.240]  Kin Geng also claimed the U.S. wishes that, quote, China should not respond in words or
[04:32.240 --> 04:34.960]  action when slandered or attacked.
[04:34.960 --> 04:37.760]  But he says this is just impossible.
[04:37.760 --> 04:39.840]  What does China view as an attack?
[04:39.840 --> 04:43.320]  And how will they respond when they ultimately feel attacked?
[04:43.320 --> 04:44.960]  Is this all just talk?
[04:44.960 --> 04:49.000]  Or will words suffice to start a physical conflict with China?
[04:49.000 --> 04:55.320]  I guess that's why Teddy Roosevelt suggested to speak softly and carry a big stick.
[04:55.320 --> 05:25.240]  This is Brian Wilson with infowars.com.

[06:05.280 --> 06:24.840]  Tuesday, March 14, 2023, we're living in the age of one, another time, another time, another
[06:24.840 --> 06:28.520]  time, is left to scream and roar until the Christmas night.
[06:28.520 --> 06:50.080]  All right, on Saturday, I came in and did a special two plus hour live broadcast with
[06:50.080 --> 06:59.240]  General Flynn, and he agreed with me that the Obama administration, third term was Biden,
[06:59.240 --> 07:06.200]  the puppet, the Chinese Communist puppet, was trying to crash regional banks to consolidate
[07:06.200 --> 07:12.880]  control so big mega banks could dominate and bring in their CBDCs, so we shouldn't buy
[07:12.880 --> 07:18.120]  into the hysteria because that's what they want, but we should also watch it and be aware
[07:18.120 --> 07:24.000]  and move your money around if you're blessed enough to have more than $20,000 in one mega
[07:24.000 --> 07:25.920]  count or more.
[07:25.920 --> 07:31.440]  Today, literally hundreds of articles, it's everywhere, the big mega banks, their stocks
[07:31.440 --> 07:36.280]  up, all the other stocks are down, the feds have the regulators in control, they could
[07:36.280 --> 07:40.720]  have propped up the Silicon Valley bank months ago, they knew about the problem a year ago,
[07:40.720 --> 07:45.120]  but instead they told the little investors to get into it, all the big money went out.
[07:45.120 --> 07:54.360]  That's mainstream news today, it's huge, and when I, Saturday said that, it got millions
[07:54.360 --> 07:58.880]  of views on YouTube, millions of views on Twitter, Melissa Tate put it out last time
[07:58.880 --> 08:07.640]  I checked her version as 900,000 views, where I said that, and the bots just flooded, just
[08:07.640 --> 08:14.640]  flooded in and said, Jones is crazy, you don't listen to him, this is all completely accidental
[08:14.640 --> 08:23.400]  even though it's tied to Sam Beekman Freed and the whole FTX situation, it's tied in
[08:23.400 --> 08:30.920]  to the deepest levels of the deep state, signature bank and SVB are about as globalist woke as
[08:30.920 --> 08:38.920]  you can get, they're the tip of the spear when it comes to that, and now it's all confirmed.
[08:38.920 --> 08:43.400]  So here's the short clip that's gone viral from Saturday and then we'll play with Tucker,
[08:43.400 --> 08:49.280]  I had to say for you last night, here it is, go back the last six months, just grab four
[08:49.280 --> 08:54.040]  or five, because I know I said it about a hundred times, times that I said next they'll
[08:54.040 --> 08:59.440]  start collapsing regional and lending banks to consolidate them into the big six globalist
[08:59.440 --> 09:04.080]  banks that own the private Federal Reserve and the European Union Bank and the rest of
[09:04.080 --> 09:08.920]  it, and then out of that they will call for central bank digital currencies to be rolled
[09:08.920 --> 09:17.640]  out just on Wednesday, Biden, the third administration of Obama put out his big new national directive
[09:17.640 --> 09:23.000]  in fact I forgot to repull that from Wednesday stack, the big quote new cybersecurity initiative
[09:23.000 --> 09:26.120]  and you read it, it's really to roll out a central bank digital currency that tracks
[09:26.120 --> 09:30.640]  controls everything you do, they'll try to ban all the normal cryptocurrencies that are
[09:30.640 --> 09:35.760]  actually independent and decentralized power, that's all announced in there and I said on
[09:35.760 --> 09:41.200]  Wednesday look for them to crash the regional banks to bring in total control, we know the
[09:41.200 --> 09:46.800]  enemy's playbook, I said will it be a banking collapse and the central bank digital currency
[09:46.800 --> 09:54.200]  casual society roll out, will it be a cyber attack to bring that in, will it be both,
[09:54.200 --> 09:58.960]  will it be a massive new terror attack, an escalation of the war, these are all cards
[09:58.960 --> 10:02.440]  because I've been looking over the enemy's shoulder what they got in their hand, I don't
[10:02.440 --> 10:08.160]  know exactly how they're going to play the cards, I don't know when they're going to
[10:08.160 --> 10:15.320]  play the cards but I know what cards they got and that's a lie, so General Flynn, former
[10:15.320 --> 10:18.480]  head of the defense intelligence agency, former top national security advisor to President
[10:18.480 --> 10:25.800]  Trump and a true patriot will be joining us here in about 57 minutes from now and we're
[10:25.800 --> 10:32.160]  going to cover the waterfront with the general commercial free for an hour straight once
[10:32.160 --> 10:38.920]  he gets on with us, so we're going to hit and that important interview is posted commercial
[10:38.920 --> 10:43.480]  free at band.video, hope you watch it, hope you share it, it was the best analysis ever
[10:43.480 --> 10:47.600]  from the general, we got a real presidential level briefing like he really gives, he just
[10:47.600 --> 10:51.360]  kind of humbly sitting there and answering questions with short answers, I said I'm going
[10:51.360 --> 10:54.280]  to shut up and I did a really good job, I probably talked 10 minutes out of an hour
[10:54.280 --> 10:59.200]  and a half interview with him, it went long and he really got to flow, I'm telling you
[10:59.200 --> 11:04.400]  this is why he was one of the top strategist, even for the globalist, he's not a globalist
[11:04.400 --> 11:10.080]  but he was Obama's favorite general because his analysis continued to be dead on and he's
[11:10.080 --> 11:13.800]  the main guy credited with the pivot towards China, that China was going to double cross
[11:13.800 --> 11:19.160]  the United States because he had been to a lot of events and seminars and joint training
[11:19.160 --> 11:22.840]  with the Chai comms, he was ordered to go do and said these people are completely at war
[11:22.840 --> 11:26.400]  with us, what the hell are you thinking, they're going to double cross the Livingstone out
[11:26.400 --> 11:31.760]  of us and of course that was more than, that was like 10, 12 years ago he convinced Obama
[11:31.760 --> 11:37.840]  for the pivot, so he knows what he's talking about, he doesn't put on an Ivy League fake
[11:37.840 --> 11:44.800]  snooty affect, oh you're so smart, no he's just a regular guy but smart as hell, that's
[11:44.800 --> 11:50.240]  why his family's got a long history in military intelligence because they definitely got the
[11:50.240 --> 11:55.040]  right stuff but the point is, is that we the human intelligence of America and the world
[11:55.040 --> 11:59.040]  have the right stuff as well and they are now going to show the articles in a moment confirming
[11:59.040 --> 12:02.800]  this is a consolidation for the mega banks, they purposely did not stabilize the bank
[12:02.800 --> 12:07.440]  early to start this process, they're calling it not a bailout, it is a bailout, we'll give
[12:07.440 --> 12:13.520]  you the rest of the story coming up but first, here's Tucker Carlson last night.
[12:13.520 --> 12:18.080]  What we know we're about to see bank consolidation, big banks eating little banks and that means
[12:18.080 --> 12:23.680]  less competition, more consolidation means more government control, so what are they
[12:23.680 --> 12:27.600]  going to do with that control, well all things being equal if people don't start making a
[12:27.600 --> 12:32.640]  lot of noise and exerting an awful lot of pressure, it'll mean digital currency, a currency that
[12:32.640 --> 12:40.160]  politicians control, sign up for the CBDC app to get your food stamps, you think that's not
[12:40.160 --> 12:43.600]  coming, of course it's coming, they'd like it to come in any case, now we're not alleging
[12:43.600 --> 12:47.600]  a conspiracy here but we did notice that the four biggest banks, Wells Fargo, Bank of America,
[12:47.600 --> 12:53.280]  JPMorgan Chase are doing well and we also noticed the White House appears to be, maybe we're
[12:53.280 --> 12:58.800]  just reading into this too much, trying to induce runs on regional banks, they seem to
[12:58.800 --> 13:03.840]  be trying to take away your confidence in those banks.
[13:03.840 --> 13:07.680]  Here's Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House Secretary, not someone we'd ever accuse of
[13:07.680 --> 13:12.000]  having an original thought but she's a vessel for the plans of others, here she is on Friday
[13:12.000 --> 13:16.560]  as SVB was collapsing, now she doesn't say a word about the fundamentals of the market
[13:16.560 --> 13:20.160]  or the security of your money in banks, instead she talks about the one thing that matters
[13:20.160 --> 13:24.640]  to her which is the racial identity of the people in charge of our finance system, watch.
[13:25.600 --> 13:30.000]  I do want to take a moment to note the historic nature of the moment that you see in front of
[13:30.000 --> 13:35.840]  you right now, all three of us are historic first in our roles, the first black woman to serve as
[13:35.840 --> 13:41.840]  CEA chair, OMB director, White House press secretary, the first black women right in front
[13:41.840 --> 13:46.080]  of you for all of those three important important key roles in the administration.
[13:46.080 --> 13:54.640]  These people lack all self-awareness as if anyone would care, why should we care,
[13:54.640 --> 13:58.480]  is there some reason to care, and by the way you are discrediting by your stupidity and
[13:58.480 --> 14:02.480]  clear incompetence anything you're promoting, you should keep that in mind.
[14:03.120 --> 14:07.600]  But big picture, if you want to make people less confident in regional banks and the banking
[14:07.600 --> 14:11.120]  system more broadly, if you wanted to maybe induce a run in the banks, this might be how
[14:11.120 --> 14:16.400]  you talk, oh we're all of a certain racial group, huh? What does it have to do with whether the
[14:16.400 --> 14:22.880]  banks have enough cash in reserve to cover their balance sheets?
[14:24.160 --> 14:27.680]  So what we do know is that the Democratic Party, the Biden administration,
[14:27.680 --> 14:34.160]  sees this crisis as a means of expanding their control. And we know this because in a recent
[14:34.160 --> 14:39.520]  Zoom call with the Fed Treasury Department and other financial regulators with members of Congress,
[14:39.520 --> 14:44.880]  Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona asked whether there was a program in place to censor social media posts
[14:44.880 --> 14:49.280]  that could lead to a national run on banks. Now that's according to Congressman Thomas
[14:49.280 --> 14:54.720]  Massey. Michael Schoenberg is a great piece on this today. Massey was on the call. So think about
[14:54.720 --> 15:01.040]  this for a second. You've got a deposit at a regional bank that's holding tons, way more than
[15:01.040 --> 15:05.120]  you know, of long-term treasuries that are worth a lot less than they were when the bank bought
[15:05.120 --> 15:11.040]  them. That means that bank is at risk. That means your money's at risk. But Senator Mark Kelly of
[15:11.040 --> 15:14.880]  Arizona doesn't want you to know about that. Why wouldn't they want you to know that?
[15:16.720 --> 15:20.400]  Kind of interesting. That kind of censorship could actually crush people.
[15:21.920 --> 15:26.880]  So we have to ask the obvious question, how close are we to some sort of disaster?
[15:28.000 --> 15:31.520]  And to what extent are the people in charge of betting it?
[15:31.520 --> 15:36.400]  Exactly. Who stands to gain? And we told you this was the next shoot-and-drop. Here's some of the
[15:36.400 --> 15:41.200]  headlines. Regional banks are seeing flight and deposits to too big to fail mega banks.
[15:42.080 --> 15:47.280]  Too big to fail banks flooded with deposits as bank run drained small banks of cash.
[15:48.240 --> 15:52.240]  And it goes on and on. We'll cover it all when we return on this very important
[15:52.240 --> 15:57.120]  Tuesday, March 14th live broadcast, infowars.com and madmaxworld.tv.
[15:57.120 --> 16:05.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new toothpaste that my dad a retired dentist and oral surgeon

[17:40.240 --> 17:44.960]  magnesium and our sweet bait and our nitric oxide and our real red pill. Plus, all of these are

[19:00.240 --> 19:05.520]  you you're either like on the border exposing the cartels and like coming under fire or you're
[19:05.520 --> 19:09.520]  on the streets of some American city hanging out with drug addicts and criminals and now you've
[19:09.520 --> 19:14.240]  gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill. Are you addicted to the danger Savannah? Have you
[19:14.240 --> 19:19.680]  ever considered that for a second? No I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans. I'm addicted to
[19:19.680 --> 19:24.240]  spreading the truth and again you know I have info wars to thank for that. Looking back on the day
[19:24.240 --> 19:29.440]  I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions. I was so grateful because you know I
[19:29.440 --> 19:34.160]  truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and under the info wars team and I really do credit
[19:34.160 --> 19:40.400]  that as to why I'm able to you know get these types of clips because Alex's whole mentality was you
[19:40.400 --> 19:46.080]  know go where the story is go where the mainstream media refuses to so it's not that I'm addicted
[19:46.080 --> 19:51.200]  to the insanity I'm just addicted to telling the truth and helping American people and I really
[19:51.200 --> 19:54.960]  do credit Alex for you know really instilling that within me early on in my career.
[19:54.960 --> 20:06.880]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones
[20:24.960 --> 20:44.880]  All right here's what we're gonna do today
[20:46.800 --> 20:51.600]  we're gonna take your calls in this hour in the second hour and then about a week and a half ago
[20:51.600 --> 20:56.800]  Roseanne Barr came in did a live Saturday show with me and she said next week the whole system's
[20:56.800 --> 21:03.360]  collapsing. The New World Order is going down next week and she was talking about the banks going
[21:03.360 --> 21:08.880]  under and everything and I didn't pull it but I said oh okay we'll see and I was thinking I got a
[21:08.880 --> 21:14.240]  bunch of text and calls the last few days saying you know Roseanne Barr predicted this so I asked
[21:14.240 --> 21:21.680]  to come on the show and she's gonna be coming back on the show in the third hour today I'm just
[21:21.680 --> 21:28.560]  gonna leave it at this until it happens we've got some really big guests tomorrow and then even bigger
[21:28.560 --> 21:37.280]  guest on Thursday so you definitely want to tune in tomorrow and Thursday these will both be really
[21:37.280 --> 21:46.960]  really big guests the guest on Thursday will be a big newsmaker I'll leave it at that so just like
[21:46.960 --> 21:54.160]  I said on Saturday going with a analysis and a dead reckoning estimation knowing the enemy's past
[21:54.160 --> 22:04.080]  present and future plans I said I don't think this will be the big bank collapse now but it's a beta
[22:04.080 --> 22:09.200]  test to position the central magnesium currencies as a solution that's not hard to predict Biden
[22:09.200 --> 22:13.760]  rolled them out as a solution to making crises on Wednesday a day and a half before this all
[22:13.760 --> 22:18.400]  officially started so it's not hard to really see what they're doing when you're got your head in the
[22:18.400 --> 22:23.760]  game but it might get out of their control I'm not saying that this thing couldn't continue as a
[22:23.760 --> 22:30.480]  domino effect chain reaction but but I see it as kind of a cascade over time the next six months
[22:30.480 --> 22:37.840]  to a year or so bringing us into right around election time in a year and a half I really
[22:37.840 --> 22:44.400]  think on the current path we're on it could change that we're going to see real economic turmoil
[22:44.400 --> 22:50.400]  and hardship that's not been seen since the 1920s and let's be clear there's an old saying nobody
[22:50.400 --> 22:56.640]  knows who exactly said it's been said by so many Robert A Heinlein who knows he was quoted as saying
[22:56.640 --> 23:04.960]  it or the first that the future is here it's just not evenly distributed and that's certainly true
[23:04.960 --> 23:12.000]  if you're in a mud hut in Africa with mosquitoes biting you all day and you can barely feed your
[23:12.000 --> 23:19.920]  family you're living in the stone age but if you're in some globalist ivory tower with a jet
[23:19.920 --> 23:26.720]  copter and the best science and the best medicine you're really living in the year 2030 already where
[23:26.720 --> 23:30.960]  if you're an average person working nine to five living in a small apartment you know you're living
[23:30.960 --> 23:37.920]  in the year 2023 so if you're starving to death in Africa or starving death in Latin America or
[23:37.920 --> 23:43.680]  areas of Asia because of the lockdowns that happened the last three years which are then
[23:43.680 --> 23:51.200]  blame of the virus but it was a deliberate plan to collapse the third world into the first world
[23:51.200 --> 23:55.760]  well you're already in a depression so a recessions when your neighbor is out of work
[23:55.760 --> 23:59.760]  and losing their house a depression is when you are out of work and losing your house
[24:01.840 --> 24:07.360]  and so I want to be clear we're already right in the middle of world war three as general Flynn said
[24:07.360 --> 24:14.000]  last Saturday three days ago four days ago the only question is will it go nuclear
[24:17.360 --> 24:21.600]  with the legitimization all over the news of tactical nuclear weapons as Flynn said
[24:21.600 --> 24:28.960]  there's no such thing as tactical weapons so we have to understand that we're in a global
[24:28.960 --> 24:33.120]  depression designed to consolidate power we're in a medical tyranny takeover designed to grab power
[24:33.120 --> 24:36.640]  we're in the middle of the collapse of third world before the first world to take power
[24:36.640 --> 24:41.440]  we're in the middle of a cultural bombardment to destabilize all of society and break up families
[24:41.440 --> 24:48.960]  we're inside the new world order but it's like if you live on a hilltop and there's a big flood
[24:48.960 --> 24:51.520]  and your neighbors are being washed away right in front of you
[24:53.920 --> 24:57.200]  but the water doesn't get up to where you're at well are you in a flood
[24:58.400 --> 25:02.160]  well yeah society around you is being devastated and it's going to affect you
[25:02.160 --> 25:08.080]  and as this out of control designed post industrial global build back better great
[25:08.080 --> 25:15.280]  reset takeover happens the water will go as high as the globalists themselves who think they're safe
[25:15.280 --> 25:24.160]  up on top the peaks of power and control they think they're safe up there on Mount Everest but
[25:24.160 --> 25:31.280]  they're not the water is rising very very quickly and you see the reports all the time of members
[25:31.280 --> 25:36.080]  of congress and members of legislatures and mayors and billionaires and their wives and
[25:36.080 --> 25:43.440]  children getting mugged getting shot getting killed getting raped or dying young of cancer
[25:43.440 --> 25:52.480]  from all the gmo and 5g so so the big lie here is the establishment pretending like they're immune
[25:53.440 --> 25:58.800]  and they're above all this because they're not and the other big lie junior only to that first one
[25:58.800 --> 26:02.800]  is for the middle class and upper middle class are people that make a million bucks a year and
[26:02.800 --> 26:07.360]  have a fancy country club membership in limina 10 bedroom house with a big swimming pool and
[26:07.360 --> 26:13.920]  travel the world and think you're you know at the heights of society you are not and you're
[26:13.920 --> 26:19.680]  in grave danger as well so from the poorest people in africa right up to the globalist at the top
[26:19.680 --> 26:29.600]  this new world order is a very dangerous chaos engine the cannon will bring down civilization
[26:29.600 --> 26:40.320]  in all their religious texts that's what i call people like no uh herari you've all know herari
[26:40.320 --> 26:44.400]  and the rest of them they say well we know civilization is going to collapse we're going
[26:44.400 --> 26:50.000]  to accelerate its collapse we're going to come out on top of it as 2.0 humans no more regular humans
[26:50.000 --> 26:57.040]  and they promise all this ai and all this special garbage it's going to protect them and and make
[26:57.040 --> 27:01.520]  them gods and none of it's happening none of it's being delivered and none of it's going to happen
[27:02.560 --> 27:07.760]  the way they say it is it's going to end up making them the target of the people who they've
[27:07.760 --> 27:13.360]  enslaved and helped destroy and so that's where i am on that front it's a very important message
[27:13.360 --> 27:21.280]  to everybody that we are going into crises and i remember driving back from predricksburg visiting
[27:21.280 --> 27:27.840]  my now late uncle and with my late grandmother but she left about an hour before us because there were
[27:27.840 --> 27:32.960]  storms forming in tornadoes she said you need to leave and i said all those tornadoes are
[27:33.520 --> 27:36.560]  two hours away and she said well they could form here because we're watching the news
[27:36.560 --> 27:43.920]  out there having a dinner having a lunch shooting guns on his ranch and so she and my ex-wife and
[27:43.920 --> 27:48.800]  children got in the car and left early me and my dad i've told the story we're driving back
[27:48.800 --> 27:55.440]  through predricksburg into stonewall almost into johnson city green sky you know at like five in
[27:55.440 --> 28:01.760]  the afternoon super high winds i'm driving like 40 miles an hour rain going sideways all of a sudden
[28:01.760 --> 28:07.520]  the tahoe starts spinning down the middle of the highway we fly off a 50 foot embankment shoot down
[28:07.520 --> 28:12.000]  i remember looking at my dad saying brace for impact and it would have killed him or i if we
[28:12.000 --> 28:17.120]  hit the oak trees a cluster of big oak trees on the side of the truck we hit it in the back
[28:17.120 --> 28:24.400]  and it crushed the back all the way up to about a foot behind the front seats so crushed the two
[28:24.400 --> 28:28.640]  other rows all the way up to us like an accordion he got a really bad concussion i got a little
[28:28.640 --> 28:39.040]  concussion but we were okay but the point is i'm saying brace for impact because the car is spinning
[28:39.040 --> 28:43.520]  down the highway in a tornado and once the state police got there like five months later they go
[28:43.520 --> 28:48.400]  no no we saw the tornado destroy that barn and grab you you were just in a tornado like wizard of
[28:48.400 --> 28:53.680]  odds with the state police guy said literally that's we're in the tornado now folks i don't know what's
[28:53.680 --> 29:00.160]  going to happen but it's going to be violent stay with us we'll be right back the fight against the
[29:00.160 --> 29:04.960]  new world order is now the top story in the world the globalist are in deep trouble but they're

[33:06.960 --> 33:28.800]  you are listening to an infowars.com front line report if you are receiving this transmission
[33:28.800 --> 33:37.600]  you are the resistance all right so we got psychotic creditors in control trying to force
[33:37.600 --> 33:43.920]  us onto a new world order ai control grid they say humans will be obsolete by 2045 the future is not
[33:43.920 --> 33:48.720]  human just look up the terms i'm giving you it'll blow you away if you haven't seen it yet and they're
[33:48.720 --> 33:53.680]  in control pretty much they're trying to get full control over our daily lives we've got to get aware
[33:53.680 --> 33:58.560]  of this we've got to stand up we've got to say no and through this technocracy they're playing
[33:58.560 --> 34:02.960]  games turning off the power turning off the energy breaking down the civilization chipping
[34:02.960 --> 34:07.920]  in the drugs and plugging the third world flooding the borders breaking up the families
[34:07.920 --> 34:13.520]  they're hitting us at every angle but if we're aware of it and warn others once a human's aware
[34:13.520 --> 34:19.520]  of an attack and decides to not submit to it and decides to fight it and decides to do everything
[34:19.520 --> 34:26.720]  you can to disrupt it it's actually invigorating it's actually fulfilling it's actually powerful
[34:26.720 --> 34:30.400]  just like when you get up off your lazy button certainly i do and you finally get into the
[34:30.400 --> 34:34.800]  gym and about 30 minutes into the workout you end up going an hour and a half more because it
[34:34.800 --> 34:38.160]  feels so good and the next day you can't get out of bed you got to take it easy when you're
[34:38.160 --> 34:41.440]  getting back into it believe me i get back into weightlifting a little bit had been doing it for
[34:41.440 --> 34:46.400]  a while i've been so busy and i overdid it last weekend worked out for like an hour hard and i was
[34:46.400 --> 34:52.880]  like whoa my legs and arms and back were so sore but it's that process and it's invigorating and
[34:52.880 --> 34:57.920]  it's empowering another big study out showing the number one thing that cures depression
[34:57.920 --> 35:03.360]  and issues is exercise hiking lifting weights swimming but again they know that they just want
[35:03.360 --> 35:11.440]  to give you some toxic some toxic pills but it's the same thing politically we've got to exercise
[35:11.440 --> 35:20.720]  we've got to use our mental and spiritual muscles if we want to get out of this just
[35:20.720 --> 35:26.240]  passively ignoring it or oh that's politics i don't care about it you may not care about politics

[48:22.800 --> 48:29.040]  all right i want to go to your phone calls but first i'm going to talk about something
[48:29.040 --> 48:35.920]  that's very important i got to know andrew tate i guess about six years ago through paul watson
[48:35.920 --> 48:42.560]  they hung out quite a bit and i knew the inside baseball three years ago when a woman claimed
[48:42.560 --> 48:48.240]  that andrew tate sexually harassed her or stalked her or something the police investigated it and
[48:48.240 --> 48:54.160]  said it wasn't true now i wasn't really fully informed on interviewing four or five times over
[48:54.160 --> 49:00.560]  the years that tate uh was making a ton of money off cam girls and soft porn type stuff out of eastern
[49:00.560 --> 49:04.960]  europe he also did it in london i think that's a dangerous profession to be involved in and i'm
[49:04.960 --> 49:12.480]  and i'm i think he's been burned by it that said he's been held for three plus months in
[49:12.480 --> 49:19.600]  solitary confinement he's lost 35 pounds he looks like hell so does his brother and the guy was a
[49:19.600 --> 49:26.720]  former world kickboxing champion his brother's world champion in a major division of chess his
[49:26.720 --> 49:32.320]  dad was a world champion chess player and the guy was very very smart and and never from what the
[49:32.320 --> 49:38.400]  intel i have did any things they say of the six women that say that he held him and exploited him
[49:38.400 --> 49:44.400]  and all this three have gone public saying they never told anybody that it's not true and one of
[49:44.400 --> 49:49.360]  the women's tie them to the government of romania her dad's the parliament so this is a political
[49:49.360 --> 49:53.440]  hit job right after the globalists come out against him right after they they noticed that he was
[49:53.440 --> 49:57.680]  reaching hundreds of millions of young men around the world about lifting weights and being strong
[49:57.680 --> 50:02.560]  and not being a wimp andrew tates even helped members of my family that were feeling sorry for
[50:02.560 --> 50:09.520]  themselves and you know not really super charging like they said uh you know that said whether he's
[50:09.520 --> 50:14.560]  guilty or not i don't believe he's guilty from what we've seen it's better the 10 guilty men go free
[50:14.560 --> 50:19.600]  than one innocent man be held he and his brother after three months they've been there since december
[50:20.640 --> 50:24.160]  december january february and end of march over three months now
[50:26.320 --> 50:31.920]  have never gotten before a judge for bail have have never been charged a year ago they investigated
[50:31.920 --> 50:35.840]  them said they weren't guilty when the same women made the first allegation
[50:37.600 --> 50:44.240]  and now today he was in a bond hearing andrew tate loses fresh appeal to be released from romanian
[50:44.240 --> 50:49.200]  prison i mean human trafficking case so we should pray for him and pray for all of our due process
[50:49.200 --> 50:54.880]  because we're becoming like romanian andrew tate special appeal against the 30 day extension of
[50:54.880 --> 51:03.040]  his detention and romania has been denied by a court meaning um and again this is the new
[51:03.040 --> 51:09.520]  article this just came out because i was reading that he was just trying to get that he was trying
[51:09.520 --> 51:14.960]  to get bond so i'm gonna go ahead and check that is is this the latest article because this just
[51:14.960 --> 51:24.000]  came out i'm gonna search that here yep there it is abc news romanian court rejects bail request
[51:24.000 --> 51:29.520]  by divisive andrew tate the official says romanian court has rejected a bail request
[51:29.520 --> 51:34.240]  from the divisive social media influencer and former professional kickboxer andrew tate
[51:34.240 --> 51:37.840]  who is detained in the country on suspicion of organized crime human trafficking
[51:40.080 --> 51:42.000]  that's like at the movie running man written by
[51:45.600 --> 51:49.920]  oh what's the name of that libtard steven kings it's a good good short story good movie with
[51:49.920 --> 51:54.320]  sword snager but it's like oh where's your brother oh he's been permanently detained

[54:19.040 --> 54:28.560]  good afternoon alex um i really i'm so i'm in the northeast and these people are so brain dead
[54:29.360 --> 54:35.200]  it's not even fun we have all this evidence that has come out that it was grown in a lab
[54:35.200 --> 54:40.640]  that it was it was manufactured everything has come out and these people are still brain dead
[54:40.640 --> 54:45.840]  i don't know i mean i try to wake people up i've lost the best friend because i bring him the
[54:45.840 --> 54:51.680]  information and he's like i can't deal with this i'm just just leave me alone meanwhile well it's
[54:51.680 --> 54:57.040]  a deep it will be yes they're in a trance they're in a form of sleep and they're under a spell is
[54:57.040 --> 55:02.080]  what the angels would call it and it's because of their personal selfishness they don't believe
[55:02.080 --> 55:07.680]  they have power they're demoralized they don't have a good opinion of themselves subconsciously
[55:07.680 --> 55:11.520]  and so they don't want to hear about problems because they feel overwhelmed they don't know
[55:11.520 --> 55:17.280]  challenging problems is what's going to empower them go ahead where there's that old saying uh it's
[55:17.280 --> 55:23.040]  easier to fool man that convinced man he's been fooled exactly uh the the boomers did this they
[55:23.040 --> 55:28.160]  did they gave up their oversight they weren't the watchdogs they let all these committees take over
[55:28.160 --> 55:32.720]  and i we're one step closer yeah we're getting we're opening people's eyes but
[55:32.720 --> 55:36.160]  i think we're one step closer to the end here especially now with the banks going under
[55:36.720 --> 55:40.720]  it's totally insane well here's what's going to happen things are going to get so bad
[55:41.360 --> 55:44.800]  that nobody's going to be able to hide under a rock so they'll have to take the same globalists
[55:44.800 --> 55:49.840]  that are destroying us and take the next phase of deeper destruction or they can finally wake up
[55:49.840 --> 55:54.880]  and say i've been conned and and come out of the cognitive dissonance well god bless you for doing
[55:54.880 --> 55:59.440]  what you do sir and i really pray for info wars and and i pray for every american and every person
[55:59.440 --> 56:03.920]  on the wall on the planet well sir i appreciate you what do you make of the field though we've
[56:03.920 --> 56:09.040]  all got to get that that testimony and magnify it and amplify it i mean it was over the top bombshell
[56:09.680 --> 56:15.440]  the fact that he knew it was going on and yet the people that were supposed to be giving him the
[56:15.440 --> 56:21.520]  information just like they did to trump uh kept it from him this is this is weapon exactly as soon
[56:21.520 --> 56:26.080]  as he said as a top neurologist exactly as soon as he said as a top neurologist i know it came out
[56:26.080 --> 56:31.280]  of a lab you know what they just isolated him sorry go ahead no it they have weaponized everything
[56:31.280 --> 56:36.400]  and this has happened this happened back under lois learner when they went after conservatives
[56:36.400 --> 56:43.440]  for for for fighting what for what was right uh people don't even have a clue anymore because
[56:43.440 --> 56:50.400]  everything is such nonsense it's i don't even know like i pray for everybody and you know what
[56:50.400 --> 56:56.720]  i don't think people are waking up fast enough i don't really i don't think they realize the gravity
[56:56.720 --> 57:03.120]  of the situation that humanity is in i 100 percent i 100 percent agree with you josh will thank you
[57:03.680 --> 57:08.560]  but but here's the paradox it's always a remnant that rebuilds we're going to wake up as many people
[57:08.560 --> 57:14.000]  as we can we have a giant remnant bigger than most that restart civilization we've got to get prepared
[57:14.000 --> 57:18.400]  we've got to keep warning people we've got to get ready and then when it finally all melts down
[57:18.400 --> 57:24.640]  believe me people will wake up just like that and then we can rebuild things so that's where
[57:24.640 --> 57:28.960]  we're going here ladies and gentlemen we have no choice i mean fighting this makes the future
[57:28.960 --> 57:34.080]  better laying down makes it worse but yeah we're going into a storm at least we know we're in a
[57:34.080 --> 57:39.520]  storm like we're not going into a storm we're in the middle of it we'll be right back with hour

[59:55.040 --> 01:00:11.280]  you are the resistance so former president donald trump who as of tonight is the front
[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:16.160]  runner for the republican nomination sent a long and really interesting response russia would never
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:20.800]  have attacked ukraine if i were president he writes not even a small chance trump says he
[01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:25.920]  opposes regime change in russia quote we should support regime change in the united states that's
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:31.760]  far more important the by-demonstration the ones who got us into this mess trump repeatedly refers
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:36.240]  to the risk of nuclear war which he describes as absolutely real and then he calls for a
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:42.400]  negotiated peace by ukraine mediated by the united states quote both sides are weary and ready to
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:46.720]  make a deal trump writes the meeting should start immediately there is no time to spare
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:52.880]  death and destruction must end now trump has been saying things like this and predicting this for
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:57.440]  five years now and he's saying it again what's interesting though is that trump's former vice
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:02.240]  president mike pence was also running for president this year opposes his old boss on nearly every
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:07.840]  point we're paying the ukranians to fight russia pence writes so we won't have to fight russians
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:13.680]  ourselves pence endorses even stricter sanctions against moscow he dismisses the risk of nuclear
[01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:18.800]  war is a quote bullying tactic from putin and then pence suggests that anyone who disagrees
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:24.800]  with his views on ukraine is a disloyal american quote there is no room for putin apologists in
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:29.680]  the republican party mike pence did not specify who he was talking about that we suspect this
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:35.440]  show is included in that treasonous category and then maybe the most newsworthy response that we
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:40.480]  received was from florida governor ron desantis desantis has well known views on many topics
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:45.200]  of course but until tonight no one could really say with precision where he stood on the war in
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:50.880]  ukraine which is arguably the most important topic in the world and now we know desantis is
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:55.520]  adamantly opposed to the position that most republicans in washington have taken on ukraine
[01:01:55.520 --> 01:02:01.680]  desantis is not a neocon who knew quote well the u.s has many vital national interests desantis
[01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:05.680]  writes securing our borders addressing the crisis of readiness within our military achieving
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:10.400]  energy security and independence and checking the economic culture very good sign for the communist
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:16.800]  party becoming further entangled in a territorial dispute between ukraine and russia is not one
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:23.840]  of them without question he writes peace should be the objective the u.s should not provide assistance
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:28.880]  that could require the deployment of american troops or enable ukraine to engage in offensive
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:34.800]  operations beyond its borders f-16s and long-range missiles should therefore be off the table
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:40.240]  these moves would risk explicitly drawing united states into the conflict and drawing us closer
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:46.880]  to a hot war between the world's two largest nuclear powers that risk is unacceptable desantis
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:52.480]  goes on to oppose the policy of regime change in moscow which is very popular in washington
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:56.800]  and he points out that the bite administration has created an alliance between russia and china
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:01.520]  and that's a disaster for the united states quote we cannot prioritize the intervention
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:07.040]  in an escalating foreign war over the defense of our own homeland especially as tens of thousands
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:11.840]  of americans are dying every year from narcotics smuggled across our open border and our weapons
[01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:19.440]  arsenals critically for our own security are rapidly being depleted so that's desantis's position
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:25.200]  clarified the vec ramaswami meanwhile who you just saw who announced for president on this show a
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:29.840]  few weeks back responded with was effectively an essay it was so tightly argued and sharp it
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:33.760]  probably should be a wall street journal piece we hope it becomes one we can't really do it justice
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:39.200]  here but a few short excerpts give you the flavor quote china wants the ukraine war to last as long
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:45.040]  as possible to deplete western military capacity before invading taiwan it's working we think we
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:50.880]  appear stronger by helping ukraine but actually become weaker vis-a-vis china we've spent 20 years
[01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:55.680]  droning people in caves in the middle east and central asia and have little to show for it we
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:04:00.080]  should be taking out the people who have caused the deaths of more than 100 000 americans every
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:05.440]  year the mexican drug cartels if i were president right now i wouldn't limit any further funding
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:11.440]  or support to ukraine ukraine is not in the top five of american foreign policy priorities right now
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:15.120]  and yet merely questioning whether the money we spent on the war is being done effectively
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:20.240]  or perhaps even prolonging the war is seen as disloyal we get accused by both democrats and
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:25.120]  republicans of being quote putin sympathizers the washington uniparty and defense contractors
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:29.440]  want this conflict to go on forever for the sake of the global economy and peace we should
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:34.320]  be doing everything we can to end it tomorrow all right so the full report it's like ten minutes

[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:26.960]  are an accident like we saw three months ago when ukraine zolensky fired two heavy missiles
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:34.160]  into holand and they tried to blame russia but thank god part of one of the missiles did not
[01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:39.520]  completely explode and so they saw that it was ukrainian incredible this just broke
[01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:44.320]  russian fighter jet crashes into u.s reaper drone over the black sea
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:49.680]  russian fighter jet is collided with an american reaper drone the black sea the u.s military
[01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:54.640]  confirmed today one western source said earlier that an investigation was underway to check whether
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:07:00.400]  the drone had been shot down the area of intense nato military activity close to ukraine war front
[01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:05.280]  lines but it was later confirmed that the collision had occurred in its u.s drones directing the whole
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:10.800]  war the source who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the information did not say
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:15.520]  which country was operating the drone which is used extensively by the united states as well as many
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:23.040]  other nato allies russian fighter jet forces down u.s drone over black sea after intercept
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:30.720]  that's cnn we're getting different stories on this u.s air force uh procures general

[01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:59.200]  totally obliterate the deep state 2024 is the final battle here it is what's happening is very
[01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:05.440]  simple our enemies are desperate to stop us because they know that we are the only ones who can stop
[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:12.720]  them and i will totally obliterate the deep state i will fire the unelected bureaucrats who have

[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:28.880]  to our justice system i will direct the department of justice to go after marx's prosecutors offices
[01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:37.360]  to make them pay for their illegal race-based enforcement of the law many racists are there
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:45.440]  and 2024 is the final battle that's it if you put me back in the white house the reign of
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:51.440]  the corrupt washington establishment will be over again say what you want about trump but man
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:57.120]  look at that rhetoric that is so bad for the new world order to be openly called out as the problem
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:00.960]  to be called out as the people running at all which they are and once people know they're the ones
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:07.440]  doing all this it's game over folks as i've been saying for decades and we're there now now we're

[01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:05.920]  operation lockstep where it talks about a cyber Cuban missile crisis and how the g20 um then
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:11.520]  creates an international cyber security treaty which then brings in the global digital currency
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:19.120]  yes we're now here yep and this goes into 2014 mount gox was the largest exchange shut down
[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:26.800]  this led to the regulations with id and social security in order in order to acquire crypto
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:32.480]  we have to remember the u.s government is the largest holder of bitcoin the ftx shut down
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:40.720]  um with its crypto access um assets is now going into the signature and sbb bank we have to understand
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:48.000]  that banking is cyber your direct deposit atm wire transfers are all cyber and if you read that report
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:55.200]  secure the net global governments uh in the digital domain it goes through a couple of scenarios
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:11:02.240]  of a cyber meltdown and cyber might not technically be cyber attacks but it could be the banking
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:09.200]  infrastructure and uh i just kind of wanted to bullet absolutely the the the bill deberg group
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:14.560]  the u.n the demo script they've all been saying cyber attacks will bring in their new global currency
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:20.800]  and they're absolutely now getting that ready right now so we are in the season of them launching this
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:27.760]  absolutely and we have to remember the cyber attacks this is also going in with the infrastructure
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:34.720]  control attacks and the banking banking we have to put banking and cyber in one in in one bubble
[01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:40.000]  now because it is the same thing um and that's all i wanted to say that's all up there at the
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:45.440]  good fight news dot com and i appreciate you Alex you are dead on i'm going to say something here
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:52.080]  the speculation 99% of what i do is not speculation when i speculate when it is a conspiracy theory
[01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:56.560]  i will say it okay and i'm almost always right on these things if i've thought about it long
[01:11:56.560 --> 01:12:00.560]  enough and don't jump the gun and i make a quick response sometimes it's it's wrong because i'm
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:08.320]  missing something only a year after we got the seven plus million dollars in bitcoin donations
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:17.520]  and had outside firms come in and do a total overview top firms of our finances going back
[01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:22.640]  many years and our bills and expenses and what was going forward did they come up with the number
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:34.480]  that the amount of money we were given in bitcoin was from one donor was exactly
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:40.080]  what we were in the rears for and what we needed to buy a new product to project forward
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:46.160]  now only ai can do that and i've talked to people at the highest not the highest i guess there's
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:52.160]  people that are the CEOs and the heads of the companies but i've talked to the top echelons
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:13:00.160]  of major ai groups okay i'll leave it at that multiples and they've one of them flew here
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:04.400]  to brief me about six months ago he said listen we're holding back on ai people don't know how
[01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:08.960]  powerful it is the stuff you see is tinker toys they don't want the public to know how good it is
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:14.880]  now okay and they explained to me we've years ago had 18 wheelers driving coast to coast perfectly
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:18.000]  they just don't want that rolled out right now that that were self driven
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:26.240]  and when i sat back and looked at that a few months ago and we learned that that it was exactly
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:30.240]  we hadn't even done our own accounting we didn't even know but they can see all the bank accounts
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:38.000]  with ai that's all fed in folks the nsa only the nsa not the chai comms and certainly not the russians
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.200]  could have ai that we didn't even know what we needed that gave us
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:48.960]  us basically exactly what we needed whoever this was knew that we were really going to be shut down
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:55.200]  i mean buzzfeed lost 110 million dollars last year all these other big i mean they don't even
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:59.760]  do anything we do all this stuff i mean it takes us 30 million dollars a year to operate
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:04.080]  but we got to sell like 50 60 million dollars worth of stuff because on average stuff's only
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:10.720]  marked up 100 percent and and so you call it luck call it god maybe it's god's ai working
[01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:17.440]  through somebody to give us the exact amount but to me it feels like ai that had all our financial
[01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:23.040]  data could actually scan through it come up with an answer and say jones is this much in the hole
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:32.160]  with a projection and then give us the exact amount just enough to dig out of the hole
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:40.640]  maybe it's not ai it probably is just god because it just continues to happen
[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:46.640]  where god wants to show me this is not anything but god it's always exactly exactly what you need
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:55.680]  when you need it so that's a crazy thing folks that is a really really really crazy thing and
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:15:01.680]  they finished the accounting the final accounting about a week ago they're doing some fine touches
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:12.880]  double checking and all but they found that i did donate 100 percent of the bitcoin i said in
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:17.280]  corkish i wasn't sure 95 percent like what's this bitcoin you put in your pocket you kept from
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:22.560]  donations to keep enforcing here and i went no i gave about 95 percent of it i knew was 100
[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:26.640]  percent but i didn't i didn't i didn't want to i kind of hedged i'm like well maybe a little bit
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:33.440]  went somewhere 95 percent i think about i said i think about 95 percent and of course they said we
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:41.200]  100 percent of it went in to these operations well of course it did i don't give a flip about
[01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:46.400]  seven half million dollars i already got offered hundreds of millions of dollars the 10-year contract

[01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:40.800]  way back when but i'm calling about redfield i think he did a stellar job in testimony
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:46.960]  when he was asked about scouchy and did he know about uh the gain of function i thought he answered
[01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:55.280]  it perfectly like there could be no doubt there was gain of function and um this whole thing i mean
[01:20:55.280 --> 01:21:02.720]  with with with um with the announcement of covet i still remember getting a call from a friend of mine
[01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:12.560]  who would do um classified tasks for the cdc redfield must have known a lot because he told me he gave
[01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:19.520]  me a call one july morning in 2020 and said i have just delivered um you're going to hear
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:27.440]  about this later today i've just delivered a slot slide deck and a suitcase with 200 thousand dollars
[01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:34.080]  cash delivered to the white house you're going to hear about something it's going to go out to
[01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:38.800]  all the congress people today it's going to go out everywhere you're going to hear about this
[01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:43.360]  well there were we've had some of the whistleblowers on that were one of the chief advisors of the cdc
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:48.800]  it was advising them did give reports to redfield everybody two and a half years ago and we've had
[01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:55.200]  mr alexander on the show to talk about that so indeed there were good people redfield going
[01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:59.760]  back two years ago said i can't say it's not man made people say well where was he then he was
[01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:05.040]  isolated but now he has blown the whistle on him and it's beautiful thank you kathy all right let's
[01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:13.440]  go ahead and take another call let's go to robert in florida go ahead robert hey uh i cashed a 22
[01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:20.400]  thousand dollar check yesterday here in florida at a credit union they flipped out it took them
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:26.320]  about an hour and a half to do it uh the lady came out and says we do not have enough hundreds and
[01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:31.040]  fifties to cover this check and i looked at the lady and i said that's fine i want one five and
[01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:37.280]  ten to change anyway i need small condemnation that's better yeah and she said you're joking right
[01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:42.560]  i said do i look like i'm joking well they went back in had another 20 minute meeting i mean this
[01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:48.400]  is only 22 grand now i'm not rich don't get it wrong but 10 years ago i cashed out like a 90
[01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:53.360]  thousand dollar check it took them four hours and i came back and picked it up but here was the kicker
[01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:59.600]  the tellers were all nervous and then they pulled out a form and they had to have all my information
[01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:03.440]  she was writing it down so is that going to the oh yeah they're gonna they're gonna put a suspicious
[01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:09.840]  transaction report in oh okay well that's fine even though you know nothing wrong it's it's absolutely
[01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:14.720]  it's your money oh i know well the people in the gulok didn't do anything wrong either so it's
[01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:22.720]  irrelevant but the point is is if my credit eating can't just flip it out over that what's going on
[01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:27.280]  with these other banks are all kinds of financial trouble well they say there's less than one 10
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:33.760]  to one percent of real cash for what there is in so-called currencies and derivatives and the rest
[01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:39.280]  of it so yeah it's not that you don't think wrong but the systems criminal i agree with you so maybe
[01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:45.760]  in the future you deposit the check or you you take it out of you know a quarter of the time because
[01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:53.520]  but but i bet you drain them of all their cash probably uh alex they only gave me 2000 in hundreds
[01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:58.160]  they were out and they weren't going to give it to me and i and i i say well i guess i'll call a
[01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:05.920]  sheriff's department and they went back in and they found it so i drained them in wow it's it's
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:09.200]  no they only gave me two down like i said and that's what i knew something was wrong and when they
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:14.960]  pulled the form out and i mean they took all it was like per so what they give you most of it in
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:24.560]  like 10s and 20s no 50s wow it was all yeah so point being is they only gave me what 2100
[01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:30.000]  dollar bills that was it wow so now i'm now i'm going back up there today i'm going to take
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:36.240]  500 and 50s and i'm going to say okay can i get some one spies and 10s now and see what they do
[01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:42.400]  yes so they only gave you a fraction of your money uh they gave me the full 22 000 oh you're
[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:46.240]  going to get even more out now i understand or bring the money back yeah well what i'm going to do
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:50.400]  is i'm going to take the 50s and hundreds back up there and keep cashing them out daily so i get my
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:54.560]  smaller denomination perfect that's smart well imagine once they have their central
[01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:58.560]  bank digital currency and it's all surveilled it's all tracked and they control it digitally
[01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:03.680]  themselves the power will give the bureaucracy is beyond that marriage thank you robert uh let's
[01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:10.640]  talk to al killer longtime caller from virginia go ahead well i just want to commend you on that
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:16.400]  interview with uh general flinn on saturday epic interview one of your best ones ever um he's
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:22.720]  absolutely right as far as um not panicking when the banking collapse happens because this is our
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:29.520]  opportunity to restructure everything for for us um he when he was bringing up the fact that we
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:34.160]  could back the currency with gold or silver it went right back to ron paul and then the fed and
[01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:38.960]  then i was even thinking about all the webster tarpley uh when he remember when he used to do
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:43.760]  uh left in the hood with uh when he would make fun of ron paul it was funny at the time but he
[01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:50.880]  had a great idea left in the hood up to no good yeah it was it was it was it was hilarious but um
[01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:58.000]  as far as being able to issues um you know the the treasury um bonds you know straight from the
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:04.400]  treasury and rebuilding our our country i think trump took is thinking that as well and the
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:08.800]  dissent is running is making trump a better candidate and that idea of building the tens
[01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:15.120]  on new super city we need to produce our way out of it okay that that is every exactly only
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:20.080]  innovation will will will bring us it's like the nasa investment of the sixties created everything
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:28.480]  we've got today exact and again everything we have is is we shoot ourselves in the foot if with
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:34.960]  with the banking collapse you know if we demand us the united states becoming a uh producer again
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:40.240]  our energy um production goes up and the prices go down and that drives everything else now instead
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:46.160]  the global server they can to increase prices make us give up and bankrupt us the answer is innovate
[01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:51.120]  be optimistic work with local businesses and work our way out of this thank you so much the call

[01:26:56.320 --> 01:27:02.720]  hi alex um thank you for taking my call thank you um i i just i'm talking i'm calling about red
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:10.960]  spelled uh you you know me i i started the corona eyes dot com uh site um and with these revelations
[01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:16.880]  you know to answer your question from earlier where do we go from here right um and where do we go
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:21.200]  from here is you know people want to say well let's go after fouchy and i think that's a big huge
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:27.040]  waste of time right now um there needs to be further proceedings based upon what runfield's
[01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:32.800]  testimony was um and i believe that you go after the underlings who have a lot of blood on their
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:37.120]  hands and there's public disclosures and admissions from them already they should at least be brought
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:45.040]  in front of congress um most particularly ralph barrick uh of north carolina uh u and c okay uh
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:54.560]  and also mark deninson uh of vanderbilt university um there are many public um videos of ralph barrick
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:28:00.880]  who exhibits at times i would go as far as to say psychopathic behavior um which could be uh
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:06.720]  seen in the way he responds to certain things most striking is the gain of function symposium
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:12.080]  held in 2014 where he was challenged by david relman of stanford university as the utility of
[01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:17.360]  gain of function research uh whereby he said um he made certain admissions uh that were later
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:24.400]  contradicted by a presentation he did in february 2020 right before the pandemic really hit um called
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:29.360]  what we know about the corona virus uh held at the coalition for life sciences in washington dc

[01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:52.640]  official on cnn saying biden has a nationalized the banking system yeah this is bigger than a

[01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:12.640]  let's rampage through calls carlos and candid on the financial issue and the global control system
[01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:20.160]  go ahead thank you very much alex just wanted to point to you something that uh is is crucial
[01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:28.080]  one has to have focus if one is not focused one cannot solve problems there is a message from
[01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:34.240]  a banker a very famous banker Nathan Rothschild who said give me control of the money issuance
[01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:42.560]  in a country and i care not who makes the law that is exactly what we're experiencing now
[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:48.880]  politicians are subject to international finance they're told what to do they're told they we used
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:53.520]  all the money and the pensions to pay to play the stock market uh you gotta get a lot of people
[01:37:53.520 --> 01:38:00.320]  you know and keep quiet that type of thing this kind of reasoning is contrary to the order of
[01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:07.280]  societies now what are the republican party who now have apparently control of the congress doing
[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:16.080]  about the quality of the election in 2024 to make sure that your vote alex cancels a genuine vote
[01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:23.680]  cancels uh the vote of someone who has not your interest at heart if that person can provide a
[01:38:23.680 --> 01:38:28.800]  fraudulent vote to cancel your vote then that person who's fraudulent will carry the day
[01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:33.200]  that's a dictatorship by fraud but let me go back to what you just said that's so key
[01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:37.520]  bankers aren't supposed to be at the top of society they're just supposed to be
[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:43.440]  managers of the modes of exchange to build a better society and to build confidence and not be
[01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:48.400]  involved in fraud it's a sacred obligation instead they've set up society by taking over the pension
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:53.120]  funds and devaluing the currency where they hold us all hostage and they're using that for total
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:39:01.280]  control what you said is absolutely paramount thank you and listen carefully capitalism is your
[01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:06.560]  enterprise what you do when you plug and when you you know you're trying to attract pension to your
[01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:12.000]  message what you do is your enterprise you capitalize that so you can run your enterprise
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:17.360]  when you print money out of thin air that's not capitalism that is bank exactly i've got to have
[01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:22.960]  a good that people then like that adds value to society or it goes away but when they can just
[01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:30.480]  print money into themselves they can prop up bad ideas like wokeism exactly so the gross domestic
[01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:36.720]  product of a country it should be the foundation of the financial issuance of currency and the
[01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:41.440]  treasury of that country should be controlled by the people not that my sticking care of the
[01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:46.080]  change in case of point the u.s is the world energy leader we have the most natural resources
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:50.240]  other than russia who hasn't tapped them but we're the most tapped they're ready to produce it it
[01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:57.200]  should be based on oil the dollar should be linked to gold or silver or rare as minerals or or oil
[01:39:57.200 --> 01:40:02.880]  or a basket it should be linked to a real commodity or it allows frauds to come in and produce things
[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:09.440]  that aren't based on the market the more a country works the greater gross domestic product it will
[01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:15.840]  encourage cooperation between countries it will encourage the issuance of the work and labor to
[01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:24.880]  produce and to and to gain um capital you see marx lenin trotsky all of these people Stalin they
[01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:32.400]  knew that when the working people had guns there was no communism the second amendment is your
[01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:39.040]  formula to cancel communism understand that read your literature it's fair it's not secret there's
[01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:46.240]  a hidden hand in the finance of politicians and money is more where we spend our money is key in
[01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:53.440]  that fight so use the money folks spend it wisely thank you carlos theresa theresa in idaho you're
[01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:59.760]  on the air hi alex thanks for having me and thanks for fighting the good fight we really appreciate
[01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:06.160]  you i appreciate you i just wanted to go real briefly on the biological weapon that i believe
[01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:11.200]  was launched at the military world games in wuhan china in 2019 i don't know if we've ever covered
[01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:16.000]  that uh that's what the chinese say happened they say the u.s government released it there
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:19.840]  it was out months before they announced that wuhan it wasn't a wet lab and now the former
[01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:24.080]  head of the cdc says the pentagon under obama produced the weapon so yeah i think that's what
[01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:30.000]  happened absolutely but i think we were in i think the chinese were totally involved because nobody
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:34.240]  wanted donald trump back in through our elections off and it no i agree they agree with the weapon
[01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:38.000]  to be launched there to control their population and to control our population they're definitely
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:43.680]  involved absolutely and briefly on the vaccine it's not just the vaccine wreaking havoc on the
[01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:48.640]  body and i'll tell you long haulers is real people that have had severe cases of covid
[01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:54.080]  and not even severe but a lot of those symptoms were neurological and it is proven that that virus
[01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:59.200]  can penetrate the blood brain barrier which is very scary and it grows prions in the brain
[01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:06.720]  absolutely and blood clots the more than 50 of patients with covid 19 will throw a blood clot
[01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:11.120]  or have blood clots in their body and not even know it so you know i just wanted to go back on

[01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:58.800]  a lot of big breaking news after that but look at these headlines moody's cuts outlook on us
[01:47:58.800 --> 01:48:05.680]  banking system to negative citing rapidly deteriorating operating environment and that the us
[01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:09.840]  banks are basically collapsing we've got this clip i'm about to play them and go to your calls
[01:48:10.960 --> 01:48:15.920]  former clinton treasury official claims biden has effectively nationalized the banking system
[01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:23.440]  far beyond bailouts they're saying any amount of money will pay joe biden has successfully
[01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:28.480]  nationalized us banks system in its response to collapse the silicon valley according to former
[01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:35.520]  deputy treasury secretary under bill clinton roger altman let's play the clip now because one
[01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:40.640]  thing that i'm hearing from the treasury department is that this is not a bailout in their view but
[01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:48.240]  for regular people it kind of looks like one what do you think well the term bailout is a
[01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:54.400]  obviously a loaded one and it's in the eye of the beholder you know it's it's like one person's
[01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:59.680]  one person sees something and thinks it's a catastrophe another person sees the same thing
[01:48:59.680 --> 01:49:08.960]  and thinks it's a small accident but the main point here is that the rescues of 2008 and 2009
[01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:16.160]  which we all remember so vividly became ferociously unpopular i mean one of the most unpopular things
[01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:21.840]  that the federal government has done in 50 or 100 years many people think they led to
[01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:30.560]  you know the growth of the tea party and the the uh the growth of the maga movement so forth
[01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:37.360]  um and therefore the administration today doesn't want to get within 100 miles of that term bailout
[01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:46.160]  now uh what the right what the authorities did over the weekend was absolutely profound
[01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:51.760]  they guaranteed the deposits all of them at silicon valley bank and what that really means
[01:49:52.880 --> 01:49:57.600]  and they won't say this and i'll come back to that what that really means is that they have
[01:49:57.600 --> 01:50:04.400]  guaranteed the entire deposit base of the u.s financial system the entire deposit base why
[01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:10.320]  because you can't guarantee all the deposits at silicon valley bank and then the next day
[01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:16.320]  they say to depositors say at first republic sorry yours aren't guaranteed of course they are
[01:50:16.960 --> 01:50:26.000]  and so this is a breathtaking step uh which effectively nationalizes or federalizes
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:33.120]  the deposit base of the u.s financial system now uh you can call it a bailout you can call it
[01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:38.560]  something else but it's it's really absolutely profound now the authorities and putting the
[01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:45.040]  white house are not going to say that because what i just said of course implies that they've just
[01:50:45.040 --> 01:50:51.520]  nationalized the banking system and technically speaking they haven't but in a broad sense they're
[01:50:51.520 --> 01:50:58.000]  verging on that by the way uh the shareholders in silicon valley bank obviously lost all their
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:03.200]  money and therefore if you're a shareholder at first republic or some of the other banks that
[01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:09.200]  you showed on your screen a few minutes ago you're concerned because you saw that in silicon valley
[01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:15.920]  bank the shareholders wiped out but the depositors at those institutions have nothing to worry about
[01:51:15.920 --> 01:51:21.280]  because they've just been guaranteed it is a remarkable statement here you say that you
[01:51:21.280 --> 01:51:25.600]  believe the the u.s banking system has been nationalized because of this
[01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:34.640]  well i know i didn't say it has been nationalized i said they're verging on that because they've
[01:51:34.640 --> 01:51:39.520]  guaranteed the entire deposit base usually is national absolutely so this is the mega
[01:51:39.520 --> 01:51:44.800]  bailout of all time but then they're going to offer central bank digital currencies once it
[01:51:44.800 --> 01:51:48.880]  undermines the collapse of the whole system they've set the precedent for that as i said saturday
[01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:59.280]  my original analysis is proving right yet again all right now a lot more coming up here ladies and
[01:51:59.280 --> 01:52:04.960]  gentlemen let's go ahead and go back to your phone calls kid in arizona go ahead hi alex first of all

[01:52:31.520 --> 01:52:37.360]  fighter in this battle and i'll i'll stick with it to the end thank you so here my comment is
[01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:42.000]  that when the banking elite collapses the system with the goal of stealing what's left and introducing
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:50.160]  the cbdc at that time we must demand their money not their new system since 1913 the credit-based
[01:52:50.160 --> 01:52:54.560]  fractional reserve banking system was their creation as such they are solely responsible
[01:52:54.560 --> 01:52:59.920]  for it when they we need a new system they don't control that's right when they crash it we demand
[01:52:59.920 --> 01:53:05.840]  they repay 200 trillion dollars let's just say of money that was lost and stolen over the years
[01:53:05.840 --> 01:53:11.520]  by their corporations banks lenders custodians brokers we demand all the money in their offshore
[01:53:11.520 --> 01:53:16.560]  accounts their llc's their family trust we demand they return the businesses and real estate they
[01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:22.240]  bought with their ill-gotten gains the nsa can identify all the accounts all over the world
[01:53:22.240 --> 01:53:27.040]  including those of related individuals family members heirs beneficiaries receivers related
[01:53:27.040 --> 01:53:32.320]  third parties including the top advisors and every associate let's take all their money back
[01:53:32.320 --> 01:53:37.920]  we want their money not their new system they created the losses now let's have them pay for
[01:53:37.920 --> 01:53:43.680]  them they stole from us let's take it back we need a globalist asset seizure we got to take
[01:53:43.680 --> 01:53:48.640]  it all at once so they can't we need sanctions and seizures of the globalist and nernberg to
[01:53:48.640 --> 01:53:54.000]  to put them on trial not in a addictive way but to stop this behavior from happening again exactly
[01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:58.640]  you got it keep up the good work alex thank you so much god bless you thank you ken beautiful
[01:53:58.640 --> 01:54:04.080]  thanks for holding an hour to say that travis in chicago go ahead i bet you're crying over
[01:54:04.080 --> 01:54:11.600]  lightfoot being gone oh no i love it he's thank god she's gone but it's no i'm glad she's gone
[01:54:11.600 --> 01:54:18.320]  with the entertainment value is like she's as bad as brian stelter so yeah she is so my uh thanks
[01:54:18.320 --> 01:54:24.800]  for taking my call alex the reason for my call is you know congress has a lot of uh state or
[01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:31.280]  supposed to have a lot of state in coining money you know article one section eight you know article
[01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:37.600]  one section ten no state shall coin money but they've advocated all that power over to the
[01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:44.240]  private federal reserve correct and and that's really the point is you know if they get if they
[01:54:44.240 --> 01:54:49.760]  go into this digitized system where people are going to be banned like we are in social media
[01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:56.000]  and everything else so then i guess you know the black market has to create some sort of barter
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:02.800]  system is that what we're going to if they get this in yeah market the beast brother i mean it's
[01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:09.040]  just unbelievable i i i'm speaking of which i need to get the hell out of illinois i mean
[01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:14.080]  and and get up to the farmlands like you're talking about so i can start growing my own food
[01:55:14.640 --> 01:55:19.440]  you know and maybe well what you gotta do is have skills whether you're a mechanic or a dentist or a
[01:55:19.440 --> 01:55:25.920]  uh an author or a teacher whatever it is get in an area that has a bunch of farm production
[01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:30.560]  and a powerful uh independent community that's the whole future is going to be that
[01:55:31.760 --> 01:55:36.880]  right well thanks for taking my call buddy love you thank you love you too god bless you
[01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:48.080]  marie in tennessee you're on the air hello yes go ahead hi alex listening since 99 love you love
[01:55:48.080 --> 01:55:59.200]  me too um worked for nonprofits for more than 10 years 501c3's had access to donor records
[01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:08.800]  to the highest levels i was in tech research and development and um basically in short uh
[01:56:10.240 --> 01:56:17.360]  uh public health and tropical medicine once a month the institution we would get like
[01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:23.120]  two and three page gift reports every day that i would see and there were things you had to do
[01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:30.080]  beyond them like acknowledgments or whatever but um once a month there would be a like a 30 page
[01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:36.960]  report and that was when the gates foundation money came in and every gift was 10 000 even
[01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:48.240]  and they were coded to public health for vaccines with numbers and letters in other words like i'm
[01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:56.000]  not saying it was COVID-19 but they were all separated all the information is in these records
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:02.160]  at these institutions and they thought they were being slick or i don't know what they thought
[01:57:02.160 --> 01:57:09.200]  but if they'd given them say a million a month it had stood out hold on don't hang up don't hang up

[02:00:24.080 --> 02:00:26.960]  they got studies at prayer if you're sick everything has the biggest effect
[02:00:27.600 --> 02:00:30.960]  and so we got callers like rachel want to talk to roseanne mariel get a chance
[02:00:30.960 --> 02:00:35.120]  here she's not in studio we're doing skype and we're gonna connect her in a few minutes but
[02:00:35.120 --> 02:00:38.560]  marie i was listening to you very carefully and i know what you're talking about but i've missed
[02:00:38.560 --> 02:00:47.920]  specifics from tennessee what were you hitting at i'm hitting at anywhere with public health and
[02:00:47.920 --> 02:00:54.720]  tropical medicine or say a primate center any kind of institution like that and i'm not going to name
[02:00:54.720 --> 02:01:03.200]  any names because i like my life um they um they're getting huge and this has been going on
[02:01:03.200 --> 02:01:15.360]  on in this case since the 1800s okay i'm not kidding viruses are big bucks alex and i know it sounds
[02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:21.360]  crazy but oh no it doesn't sound crazy the un said five years ago their world government
[02:01:21.360 --> 02:01:30.240]  taker were planned hinged on disease x yeah yeah well i mean and worse like same institution
[02:01:30.240 --> 02:01:34.880]  one of the things they were studying that they got money from the department of defense for
[02:01:35.520 --> 02:01:42.960]  was why prostate cancer was killing black men why would the department of defense be studying
[02:01:42.960 --> 02:01:50.560]  prostate cancer in black men learn how to spread it better crazy crazy we know a lot of its viral
[02:01:50.560 --> 02:01:56.800]  so so get back to this coding you would see money coming in coded i saw all the money that came in
[02:01:56.800 --> 02:02:02.240]  i had to pass it took six months for me to get this job because of the security and background
[02:02:02.240 --> 02:02:06.800]  checks that's why so talk to me like i'm five years old the three minutes left tell me without
[02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:13.920]  getting yourself in trouble i get it what you were witnessing tremendous amounts of money coming in
[02:02:13.920 --> 02:02:26.240]  and um public health uh doing stuff in africa and peruse specifically at that time with that money
[02:02:27.200 --> 02:02:35.200]  but it was specifically for vaccines but not just one vaccine like i'm like i said 30 like
[02:02:35.200 --> 02:02:42.560]  30 different gifts a month with everyone was different so they have like like the lot numbers
[02:02:42.560 --> 02:02:48.400]  or whatever which as an aside which is mainly the reason why i'm interested in all this my
[02:02:48.400 --> 02:02:57.440]  daughter was vaccine injured way back in 2004 and um by then the state where we got the shots
[02:02:57.440 --> 02:03:06.080]  had a huge computer um to input all of the data and i had been skating on not getting them shot
[02:03:06.080 --> 02:03:15.200]  since the 90s and they caught up with me and um i had to do it and terrible things happened
[02:03:15.200 --> 02:03:20.560]  but my daughter just told me recently that she got her medical records um because she still has
[02:03:20.560 --> 02:03:26.320]  problems she's in her 30s now and she still has issues from all from what happened to her and
[02:03:26.320 --> 02:03:32.480]  she said that they had the lot numbers of the shots oh yeah gregory said great reports last year
[02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:37.840]  and this year showing how they sent out these hot lots like targeted missiles on who they
[02:03:37.840 --> 02:03:42.240]  wanted to kill in one area and that's the whole thing it's a medical tyranny it's out of control
[02:03:43.280 --> 02:03:48.560]  immortal cell lines they're now using to make bill gates is artificial meat that causes cancer
[02:03:48.560 --> 02:03:53.200]  i mean these people are sick we've got to get our minds around these mad scientists
[02:03:53.920 --> 02:03:56.720]  marie thank you so much for the call and i'm sorry for what happened to your daughter

[02:06:34.800 --> 02:06:42.080]  today is a very important jewish day because it's the shabbat before porum and porum is the boomerang
[02:06:42.080 --> 02:06:49.280]  and the boomerang is coming and i feel it because that's my religion and i do practice it so that
[02:06:49.280 --> 02:06:56.480]  means satan does not exist today because he cannot exist on a holy day he can't live anywhere in holy
[02:06:56.480 --> 02:07:03.600]  space so that means that our prayers go straight to god today he can't interfere or f with them or
[02:07:03.600 --> 02:07:10.640]  nothing else i came here because i want people to pray with us that we can overcome all machinery
[02:07:10.640 --> 02:07:18.080]  that has ties to the satanic lower world of evil that we break all those ties all those satanic
[02:07:18.080 --> 02:07:25.360]  vows that people have taken may they be cut today may they not exist tomorrow all those who
[02:07:27.600 --> 02:07:34.720]  do have the spark of the soul in them in a in the most high positions of power
[02:07:34.720 --> 02:07:43.360]  or will feel that spark grow and they will remove themselves just simply by resigning
[02:07:45.040 --> 02:07:49.360]  for the sins they've committed against the children of this world may they just
[02:07:49.920 --> 02:08:00.080]  grow enough soul to kindly remove themselves and may god guide a person of wisdom and ethics
[02:08:00.080 --> 02:08:09.200]  and morality to replace them may that happen immediately and may may the souls of the human
[02:08:09.200 --> 02:08:15.840]  beings who care for other human beings and for this country and what it stands for which is a
[02:08:15.840 --> 02:08:23.200]  melting pot of individual rights not group rights where people are punished for things they didn't do
[02:08:23.200 --> 02:08:31.520]  but for justice and equality including women like me who have the power to speak freely
[02:08:31.520 --> 02:08:38.320]  and to own property and to work it with the sweat of their brow and that's beautiful please pray
[02:08:38.320 --> 02:08:48.240]  on their knees to a big elitist group who think of us as their slaves or their pray may that end
[02:08:48.240 --> 02:08:54.640]  today and i'll ask you alec to say amen with me amen so what do you got level things about to happen
[02:08:56.240 --> 02:09:02.000]  i think what's about to happen is because we prayed here today all that it's going to break down and
[02:09:03.040 --> 02:09:08.080]  i think that nothing's going to happen i think they're all going to get caught i think that
[02:09:08.880 --> 02:09:15.120]  the whole epstein thing's going to be exposed i think that intelligence and the people and all
[02:09:15.120 --> 02:09:20.400]  the research they're doing is going to pay off i think every one of them as my friend said about
[02:09:20.400 --> 02:09:27.120]  20 years ago the children will speak the names of their abusers in public i think it will crumble
[02:09:27.120 --> 02:09:35.360]  everything that's all it's about it's a pedo ponzi scheme and uh a pedo ponzi scheme it's
[02:09:35.360 --> 02:09:42.720]  yeah currency is children this is the thing that's going to happen alex all the bull is going to fade
[02:09:42.720 --> 02:09:49.120]  and burn away it is now yeah it is now we're just not catching fire yes it is the sparks have caught
[02:09:49.120 --> 02:09:54.480]  fire and it's all burning away the old is going to go and the new is just being born and what's
[02:09:54.480 --> 02:09:59.440]  going to happen is that the writings of jesus that people don't know about and they've tried to
[02:09:59.440 --> 02:10:05.520]  destroy for 2000 years they tried to bury it they tried to silence him they tried to you know
[02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:10.640]  everything they've done to him but people know in their hearts that what he spoke was true it's
[02:10:10.640 --> 02:10:14.880]  going to come now it's going to bloom and everybody's going to read it and see it for themselves
[02:10:16.640 --> 02:10:22.480]  see the full interview at man dot video so it became a viral story ever she was on with with
[02:10:22.480 --> 02:10:28.960]  lovers of liberty really liked the interview but the left made jokes and said oh a psychotic
[02:10:28.960 --> 02:10:34.560]  break on air she's praying to god that's insane but regardless the new order is coming down right
[02:10:34.560 --> 02:10:41.120]  now rosanne bar joins us we're going to talk about so much peabody award for television excellence

[02:10:58.160 --> 02:11:03.440]  to talk to you uh but boy did you call it whether it's your prayer your instincts whatever it was
[02:11:03.440 --> 02:11:06.240]  because the whole system is in free fall right now
[02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:17.760]  yeah it's uh it's pretty stunning to see it um i i also found a prayer i did on 11 11 11
[02:11:17.760 --> 02:11:25.520]  which i've reposted and in that prayer we cut all ties to satanic energy on this earth and we named
[02:11:25.520 --> 02:11:34.640]  the various um uh heads of that and we we cut all ties to uh the power that they have taken for
[02:11:34.640 --> 02:11:41.120]  themselves to make the people their slaves and to own all things on earth and um i was watching it
[02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:47.520]  and i sent it to you alex and it's like every single thing that we said in that prayer has happened
[02:11:47.520 --> 02:11:53.040]  to we prayed that the masses would see what's being done to them and that they would awaken
[02:11:53.040 --> 02:11:58.880]  and that was in 2011 and i was watching it going oh my god it has happened people have
[02:11:58.880 --> 02:12:06.000]  woken up to the fact that you know there we were and i'm saying in the past we were living under
[02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:12.240]  a fourth rife you know people didn't understand that the nazis they didn't actually lose as people
[02:12:12.240 --> 02:12:19.280]  have been told but they they came to america and and you know continued to use captive populations
[02:12:19.280 --> 02:12:26.400]  as you know their prey to do experiments on and and it's continued till now captive populations
[02:12:26.400 --> 02:12:33.040]  in south america and all over the world and and and america too that in the rural poorest parts of
[02:12:33.040 --> 02:12:38.960]  our country and in our prisons and in our hospitals not everything they well there's no doubt the whole
[02:12:38.960 --> 02:12:43.680]  cuban rollout you're right the whole cuban rollout was turning us all into medical experiments
[02:12:43.680 --> 02:12:48.720]  taking over our bodies i mean what an incredible power grab well look what they did they did it
[02:12:48.720 --> 02:12:54.880]  in africa starting with the polio vaccine a wonderful journalist named celia farber everyone
[02:12:54.880 --> 02:13:03.040]  should look her up she did a study and sent it to me in the early 1990s about how uh it was was it
[02:13:03.040 --> 02:13:10.240]  coincidence uh that the aides epidemic started at the same place in africa where they were doing
[02:13:10.240 --> 02:13:16.480]  the studies and experiments for the polio vaccine and she did great research and scholarship on that
[02:13:16.480 --> 02:13:21.760]  and people should look it up they've just lied to us everything's a bunch of bs and they just lied
[02:13:21.760 --> 02:13:27.840]  to us they've told us fairy tales you know that uh people that i fired from the rosa and show
[02:13:27.840 --> 02:13:32.880]  you know they went and got political started writing for the dnc and they make up stories and
[02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:38.640]  they feed it through the television and the fake news and people buy it it's all fairy tales but
[02:13:38.640 --> 02:13:44.480]  the good news is less and lesser buying even though even the ap reports the majority of polio cases
[02:13:44.480 --> 02:13:53.440]  caused by bill gates's program well yeah absolutely well bill gates is i mean oh my god i don't even
[02:13:53.440 --> 02:13:58.960]  know if that is bill gates or it's some cyborg that they created to look like bill gates to you
[02:13:58.960 --> 02:14:06.080]  know sell their bs that will line up to let them you know send us to the showers or the vaccines
[02:14:06.080 --> 02:14:11.840]  i don't know but i do know i can just watch i mean we're under heavy mind control in this
[02:14:11.840 --> 02:14:18.480]  country and i've talked about mk ultra for decades we're under mk ultra mind control well my whole
[02:14:18.480 --> 02:14:24.960]  generation was mk altered by the wizard of walls you know and my grandson's generation was mk
[02:14:24.960 --> 02:14:32.000]  altered by uh harry potter the we live by these movies and stories and fairy tales that they that
[02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:39.120]  they sell us and then they continue to sell it every day and through products everything and so
[02:14:39.120 --> 02:14:44.960]  we don't we live in a fake reality we don't even know what reality is if it bit us in the face and
[02:14:44.960 --> 02:14:51.440]  that's what uh is so great because we were talking about how god tells us no weapon formed against
[02:14:51.440 --> 02:14:58.000]  us can win right well when they put us in i'd say q is for quarantine but when they put us into
[02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:03.280]  quarantine they thought you know they thought uh we were gonna sit there in front of the tube and
[02:15:03.280 --> 02:15:08.400]  get more and more brainwashed but instead as i told you alex they know nothing about the human
[02:15:08.400 --> 02:15:14.320]  spirit or the human soul because they don't have either but um and they keep studying it because
[02:15:14.320 --> 02:15:19.920]  they can't pinpoint it they have no idea what it is but when they did that what they actually did
[02:15:19.920 --> 02:15:25.680]  was break our mind control because what happens is when you break your patterns and i would advise
[02:15:25.680 --> 02:15:30.560]  everybody to break your patterns as quickly as you can when you break your patterns you also

[02:19:54.160 --> 02:20:05.600]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[02:20:15.520 --> 02:20:19.520]  all right you know i've talked to rosie and bar on the phone for years never met her until
[02:20:19.520 --> 02:20:23.760]  person a few weeks ago and she said i'll be the real me she's a funny comedian and a grandma the
[02:20:23.760 --> 02:20:29.760]  rest of it the farmer but really smart on air really smart not you know on air in person
[02:20:30.480 --> 02:20:34.800]  and i said hey we're up the phones up she's happy to talk to anybody wants to talk about any subject
[02:20:34.800 --> 02:20:44.320]  even if it's silly the toll free number is 877-789-2539-877-789 alex 877-789-2539 but but but
[02:20:44.320 --> 02:20:47.680]  rosie on the time we have i'm gonna try to shut up now because i'm gonna ask you this big picture
[02:20:47.680 --> 02:20:54.560]  question you can drill in anything you want but regardless we can't be so negative and i think
[02:20:54.560 --> 02:20:59.280]  you're being very positive to think the globals are invincible every project they've got their
[02:20:59.280 --> 02:21:05.520]  poison shots their world government their wars their open borders uh their censorship all their
[02:21:05.520 --> 02:21:10.560]  programs are being exposed right now which i think makes them more dangerous than ever but
[02:21:10.560 --> 02:21:17.360]  what would you call this period of time we're in right now rosie and bar um it's a dangerous
[02:21:17.360 --> 02:21:23.280]  scary scary scary time it's never been this dangerous it's never been this scary it's for
[02:21:23.280 --> 02:21:29.760]  the united states of america the last the last stand this is the last stand and uh you know it
[02:21:29.760 --> 02:21:34.320]  depends on the people waking up and they don't want to do it you can't wake people that are
[02:21:34.320 --> 02:21:40.240]  pretending to be asleep i heard that quote and i think that that applies to uh the people in america
[02:21:40.240 --> 02:21:46.240]  they they don't want to put away all their fake play toys you know and uh they don't want to see
[02:21:46.240 --> 02:21:50.880]  what's right in front of their face they'd rather talk about the queen of england and what she's doing
[02:21:50.880 --> 02:21:56.160]  than see what their own kids are up to and that's been going on for a real long time that's what mk
[02:21:56.160 --> 02:22:01.520]  ulter is about where you don't see what's right in front of your face you sweep stuff under your rug
[02:22:01.520 --> 02:22:06.800]  until your rug covers your whole house the dirt under it you never clean your house you never
[02:22:06.800 --> 02:22:12.320]  clean your own mind up you never clean what's you know you don't take care of what you need to take
[02:22:12.320 --> 02:22:20.880]  care of and then you just die under a pile of crap you know hoarding uh false stuff and uh you
[02:22:20.880 --> 02:22:26.880]  know now they're talking about the un is going to make a move on us and nobody knows about it i wish
[02:22:26.880 --> 02:22:31.440]  people would really start reading about that alex i wish you'd already made their move they got a
[02:22:31.440 --> 02:22:38.880]  un treaty that takes over everything i'm so scared for america where's our where's our army
[02:22:38.880 --> 02:22:43.600]  where's our army at our our border when we're being invaded where's our generals
[02:22:45.760 --> 02:22:50.880]  is it over already and we just don't know it i'm scared about that which is why i came on
[02:22:50.880 --> 02:23:00.720]  your show to pray that i mean i like america i like being i like living in uh freedom for women
[02:23:00.720 --> 02:23:08.240]  i like that that exists i like i like the idea of equality that we continue to work towards it you
[02:23:08.240 --> 02:23:12.800]  know although we're not there and everybody knows it but well i said i was going to interrupt that's
[02:23:12.800 --> 02:23:16.880]  such a key point what country in the world do women have more freedom and deservely so i got
[02:23:16.880 --> 02:23:22.320]  three daughters but at the same time they train women to attack this country as if it's attacking
[02:23:22.320 --> 02:23:28.400]  women when it's the best country for women well yeah i think that i think you know like i said they
[02:23:28.400 --> 02:23:35.840]  put obama in the window to uh be in the window so everybody could think we were real a not racist
[02:23:35.840 --> 02:23:40.800]  country at the same time that they robbed the black middle class of its wealth and then they
[02:23:40.800 --> 02:23:46.480]  were planned to put hillary up there in the window as they took away the rights of women but instead
[02:23:46.480 --> 02:23:52.160]  things went a little awry in the plan you know but they still are continuing on and taking away the
[02:23:52.160 --> 02:23:58.160]  rights of women with you know all all this stuff they have this pure anti-women's rights and they
[02:23:58.160 --> 02:24:04.480]  got women leading it so um you know people can't see that either because they changed the names
[02:24:04.480 --> 02:24:10.960]  they call things um free when you know it's what the nazis did uh that sign oh it is this is
[02:24:10.960 --> 02:24:15.360]  paradoxical you text me and say be more positive and i get you on you're being negative i agree it's
[02:24:15.360 --> 02:24:20.240]  a paradox but at least people are waking up right now though i think we're actually winning i i think
[02:24:20.240 --> 02:24:27.280]  we're winning rosanne i do too and and here's what i've said was coming um sometimes things
[02:24:28.160 --> 02:24:33.920]  are revealed after they're concealed you know they're concealed for a long time and then when
[02:24:33.920 --> 02:24:39.680]  they're revealed people might think that's negative but i think that that is very positive
[02:24:40.640 --> 02:24:47.200]  so it's kind of a paradox a little bit you know what i mean but i think that it's very positive
[02:24:47.200 --> 02:24:53.360]  because in the end everybody will be totally aware and everything is about awareness and you can
[02:24:53.360 --> 02:24:58.240]  fight it for so long but it's still going to get you it might get you too late and then it's sad
[02:24:58.240 --> 02:25:03.600]  but i hope people wake up before it's too late and then they have even one minute of awareness to
[02:25:03.600 --> 02:25:09.840]  see what's coming but right now if they would wake up and be aware we could stop it i think we have
[02:25:09.840 --> 02:25:15.200]  stopped it but i think there's a lot of pain coming even though it has stopped it's going to
[02:25:15.200 --> 02:25:21.760]  skid exactly and there's gonna be pain for a while we're seeing enemy death rows them trying to
[02:25:21.760 --> 02:25:27.600]  claws back with them and what you said is so key just seeing it is the spiritual jump that's everything
[02:25:27.600 --> 02:25:33.600]  you need you don't have to beat it if you can recognize it you have spiritually transcended it so
[02:25:33.600 --> 02:25:40.560]  folks you know people see this overwhelming thing that's what's coming and i wanted to say the more
[02:25:40.560 --> 02:25:47.200]  you know here here's a spiritual exercise that you can do when you're just sitting there look up
[02:25:48.400 --> 02:25:56.240]  you know the act of just looking up is a spiritual exercise because we are really programmed to look
[02:25:56.240 --> 02:26:03.600]  down or to look sideways or around but how often do you look up to the moon or you look at the stars
[02:26:03.600 --> 02:26:10.400]  are you exactly it's it's just you're looking into infinity and and and to god that's exactly right
[02:26:10.400 --> 02:26:15.920]  and i think that's what's coming to what's coming is a lot of people say they believe in god that's
[02:26:15.920 --> 02:26:22.240]  what i really wanted to talk to you about a little bit more people say they believe in god but all my
[02:26:22.240 --> 02:26:30.960]  life i've learned that that isn't true um for one thing belief is kind of bs when you think about it
[02:26:30.960 --> 02:26:36.160]  because okay the sun is going to come up whether you believe it is you're not a believer you're an
[02:26:36.160 --> 02:26:42.960]  acceptor and a knower a knower exactly and you know how you know it because this is one thing that
[02:26:42.960 --> 02:26:49.920]  Judaism teaches us is that you know it in your body and how you know it in your body is when you
[02:26:49.920 --> 02:26:58.560]  hear something holy or a holy name or a holy word the hairs on your body stand up you know it in your
[02:26:58.560 --> 02:27:06.480]  body because when you hear truth the hairs stand up so that is your connection that is your connection
[02:27:06.480 --> 02:27:15.120]  to know that words and speaking affect matter it's physics that's how you know that god is in you
[02:27:15.120 --> 02:27:22.320]  because when you hear something that brings you to god or that god is touching you the hair
[02:27:22.320 --> 02:27:28.640]  on your body stands so you don't need to believe that that's a knowing and a feeling well that's
[02:27:28.640 --> 02:27:32.480]  what happens i'll have a guest on i'll have a guest on that says something and the hair on the back
[02:27:32.480 --> 02:27:36.560]  of my neck stands up and what they said always when you were here a week ago my hair on the back
[02:27:36.560 --> 02:27:41.040]  of my neck was standing up you were saying all that that's my spirit going no that's real that's
[02:27:41.040 --> 02:27:47.520]  right that's our knowing that's our key and people they don't know a lot of things because
[02:27:47.520 --> 02:27:53.360]  they've been kept from us and we've been told fairy tales and a lot of it is really black magic
[02:27:53.360 --> 02:28:00.640]  too that we've been told is religion but it isn't like i told you before there's black magic and
[02:28:00.640 --> 02:28:09.280]  white magic and then there's god and i think that as people people are going to be scared shitless
[02:28:09.280 --> 02:28:15.840]  and they're going to go what how come my belief isn't working for me and it's not going to work
[02:28:15.840 --> 02:28:23.680]  and i told you knowing is going over and plugging into that energy putting the plug into the wall
[02:28:23.680 --> 02:28:31.200]  socket and they haven't given us the plug they've kept that plug from us they kept us from knowing
[02:28:31.200 --> 02:28:37.280]  what we were made for and what our connection is and i just want people to know the connection
[02:28:37.280 --> 02:28:44.400]  begins with the hair on your body standing when you hear truth stay there so powerful i totally
[02:28:44.400 --> 02:28:49.200]  agree i've experienced myself it's not like you tell god what to do you say god i'm here you
[02:28:49.200 --> 02:28:54.080]  jack into god and then it's like whoa you just plugged into it we'll be right back with rozan

[02:33:02.560 --> 02:33:17.600]  world order it's alex jones the world is in major upheaval and the awakening seer but the enemy
[02:33:17.600 --> 02:33:29.120]  is going to strike back we gotta be ready live from austin texas it's alex jones
[02:33:29.120 --> 02:33:35.680]  roseanne bars with us i'm gonna tell this story and it's not about me it's about all of us because
[02:33:35.680 --> 02:33:41.440]  we're all transceivers we receive and transmit our dna does it scientist of provident and it's
[02:33:41.440 --> 02:33:45.440]  it's in the bible it's in the holy scriptures we know it's real we're meant to commune with god
[02:33:45.440 --> 02:33:51.040]  that's worship that's plugging in worship's not just oh i worship you you're the best oh i worship
[02:33:51.040 --> 02:33:58.080]  a golden calf it's i love you i interface you christ is the groom where the bride but i remember
[02:33:58.080 --> 02:34:02.960]  and i can't find the photos since online this is about six years old before i grew a beard
[02:34:03.760 --> 02:34:08.880]  that i was at an event and i remember this family with a bunch of their children and looking down
[02:34:08.880 --> 02:34:13.120]  and seeing how beautiful their children were and wanting to defend them and love them and the family
[02:34:13.120 --> 02:34:18.160]  took a picture i remember this photo was online for a while we can't find it now but somebody
[02:34:18.160 --> 02:34:23.920]  an artist found the photo years ago and mailed me this painting uh in in in watercolors if you
[02:34:23.920 --> 02:34:28.000]  get a little bit closer i want to show it or maybe during the next segment we'll get a camera
[02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:33.600]  closer to it but but if you look in my eyes it's it's it's it's love and it's it's a commitment to
[02:34:33.600 --> 02:34:39.760]  the children and the future i think it's the best photo of me because because it also shows a sadness
[02:34:39.760 --> 02:34:45.600]  and a commitment and a and a and a timelessness uh to all of this while rossians talking we'll
[02:34:45.600 --> 02:34:50.720]  we'll move it around get a better close up shot on the eyes but that's not alex jones that's me
[02:34:50.720 --> 02:34:56.240]  looking at god through those children in the future and god being reflected back by them
[02:34:56.240 --> 02:35:01.040]  and the love and the commitment and i think it's the best photo of me because it's not alex jones
[02:35:01.040 --> 02:35:06.400]  it's like a pool of water that those children's faces looking into and it's the adult realizing
[02:35:06.400 --> 02:35:10.480]  everything i'm going to do when i've gone through is beyond worth it because it's for them and i
[02:35:10.480 --> 02:35:14.720]  think it's that timelessness and that connection to the past the present the future and our children
[02:35:14.720 --> 02:35:20.480]  and grandchildren and their project and building a world for all of them to have an amazing creative
[02:35:20.480 --> 02:35:25.600]  dynamic time that's really our mission and by stepping into that mission it's not work it's it's
[02:35:25.600 --> 02:35:32.320]  it's a blessing rosanne bar please continue yeah i think you said once you are on jill rovin you
[02:35:32.320 --> 02:35:38.960]  you use the r word you know you said well i'm kind of retarded and um i i laugh because i i'm like
[02:35:38.960 --> 02:35:45.760]  that too we're probably on some kind of spectrum where we're just fixated on something and we're
[02:35:45.760 --> 02:35:52.880]  we're like because we've talked about this too we can't stop or like we we're compelled to do what
[02:35:52.880 --> 02:36:00.240]  we do and we we can't stop doing it because we we just feel like we were put here to do it we were
[02:36:00.240 --> 02:36:06.480]  put here to say a certain something because it's so far down in our heart and our soul that if we
[02:36:06.480 --> 02:36:12.240]  don't do it we'll just start going nuts i don't know what i do if i wasn't saying what i'm saying
[02:36:12.240 --> 02:36:17.920]  and i tried so hard not to say it for a really long time too i tell myself no you can't do it you
[02:36:17.920 --> 02:36:24.960]  know they'll what they'll do to you what they'll say about you if you say you know that you see
[02:36:24.960 --> 02:36:28.960]  and feel and but you just hit the nail on the head in erupting because you're so on target
[02:36:28.960 --> 02:36:32.720]  is z kill the old testament says i can't stop you they're gonna kill me it's in my bones
[02:36:32.720 --> 02:36:36.960]  they think threatening us or attacking us will make a stop we can't stop i think you just said it
[02:36:36.960 --> 02:36:44.000]  we literally cannot stop no no we're on some sort of spectrum i don't know i always felt it all my
[02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:49.840]  life and i always tried to hide it because people would think you're crazy like i talked to you about
[02:36:49.840 --> 02:36:56.720]  foresight you know and these prayers and meditations i've done is because i always see something coming
[02:36:56.720 --> 02:37:03.440]  and i want to stop it i feel like nobody else is doing it so i have to if because i feel spiritually
[02:37:03.440 --> 02:37:10.160]  like if you can you must you have to if you are able and you if you're able to and you have the
[02:37:10.160 --> 02:37:15.680]  ability to and you don't and you're going straight to hell that's how i look at it and i always have
[02:37:15.680 --> 02:37:21.760]  if you are able to help and you don't what are you that that's that Jewish thing you know if i'm
[02:37:21.760 --> 02:37:28.720]  only for myself what am i you know if not now when that's what that means so i've always felt like
[02:37:28.720 --> 02:37:35.040]  well if i'm able to help someone or to speak on their behalf when they cannot well then i have
[02:37:35.040 --> 02:37:40.640]  to do it or god's going to get mad at me and like i always said i didn't mind pissing off networks
[02:37:40.640 --> 02:37:47.680]  and guys in suits but i for sure i'm not going to dare piss off god i don't want god mad at me on
[02:37:47.680 --> 02:37:56.240]  my last breath i know i i can't have that and so now the big battle's here just you've got the
[02:37:56.240 --> 02:38:04.320]  floor here's the good part of it the big battle is that everything that everybody thinks they believe
[02:38:04.320 --> 02:38:11.200]  is not and it's not going to work for them but everything that they know is going to work for
[02:38:11.200 --> 02:38:17.760]  them and i think it's going to be a huge evolutionary leap for us i think for the first time in our
[02:38:17.760 --> 02:38:24.880]  history as human beings no church and no state can stand in the way of what we know and the
[02:38:24.880 --> 02:38:31.280]  information we can take and the information we can share and what we can begin as i talked about
[02:38:31.280 --> 02:38:36.400]  on your show too for the first time we will be able to freely imagine a world that will work
[02:38:36.400 --> 02:38:41.520]  for us that will work for our children that will work for the future for the first time nobody's
[02:38:41.520 --> 02:38:47.840]  going to tell us how to uh you know kill us and once we have that spiritual energy environment
[02:38:47.840 --> 02:38:53.920]  right we'll all just think an environment that doesn't work for us which in fact kills us how
[02:38:53.920 --> 02:38:59.680]  to grow food which in fact doesn't nourish but kills us how what are we going to do instead
[02:38:59.680 --> 02:39:06.480]  that's what we need to immediately begin to imagine and devise because if we don't envision and
[02:39:06.480 --> 02:39:11.120]  imagine it isn't going to happen that's what people don't know that's why god gave us a brain
[02:39:11.120 --> 02:39:18.400]  so that we could envision imagine and create the world that we want to lift this place from the
[02:39:18.400 --> 02:39:25.680]  hell they've told us we deserve to the heaven that we can make that we are totally capable of making
[02:39:25.680 --> 02:39:33.040]  once we imagine it once we envision it once we see it once we have faith in ourselves and each
[02:39:33.040 --> 02:39:39.440]  other because that's all we have on this hell plane that we've let you know that we've sunk to
[02:39:39.440 --> 02:39:45.520]  that they pushed us to we're gonna you know they are just move them aside don't worry about them
[02:39:45.520 --> 02:39:52.240]  take your eyes off of them look up look within that's the big the biggest war on this planet
[02:39:52.240 --> 02:39:58.480]  is the war within forget about the one out there the one out there is created by the one within
[02:39:58.480 --> 02:40:05.520]  go within figure it out clean it up get right look up get right with you know the last breath
[02:40:05.520 --> 02:40:10.320]  you're gonna take know that you're gonna feel good on that last breath that you're gonna have
[02:40:10.320 --> 02:40:17.280]  nothing anymore to repent for to feel remorse for because you've taken care of it you've made it
[02:40:17.280 --> 02:40:22.720]  right do that right now the faster you can do that the freer you're gonna think the clearer
[02:40:22.720 --> 02:40:28.480]  you're gonna think the more love is gonna enter your heart the bigger and better things are gonna
[02:40:28.480 --> 02:40:33.600]  do the more empathy you're gonna have room for because you're not gonna be filled up with shame
[02:40:33.600 --> 02:40:39.520]  and doubt and regret you're gonna be filled up with nothing but love and that's the world we're
[02:40:39.520 --> 02:40:45.680]  gonna create and we're we can save it we still you know you know spirit in there is no time
[02:40:45.680 --> 02:40:53.120]  and space space in the spiritual world that that was in the physical world this world that we're in
[02:40:53.120 --> 02:40:57.920]  there's friction there's time and space so that we won't really see clearly
[02:40:59.840 --> 02:41:05.840]  cause an effect because there'll be a big gap between so we won't see that what we do causes
[02:41:05.840 --> 02:41:11.840]  what happens to us we can't know that but the people in charge of us the owners of the world
[02:41:11.840 --> 02:41:19.600]  they know that and they're playing with us like rats putting us in a maze you know they know
[02:41:19.600 --> 02:41:27.200]  everything they they know everything they know how to manipulate us they know how to manipulate
[02:41:27.200 --> 02:41:32.960]  our genes they know how to give us diseases they know how to make money off those diseases
[02:41:32.960 --> 02:41:38.160]  they know how to treat those diseases they know how many people you know they take bets on how
[02:41:38.160 --> 02:41:46.400]  many of us are going to die and and and they invest in those bets they invest in our death and they
[02:41:46.400 --> 02:41:52.320]  get to pay off whatever one of us dies you can't know that they actually take insurance policies
[02:41:52.320 --> 02:41:57.120]  out on their own employees and they don't have to tell the employees that they have those insurance
[02:41:57.120 --> 02:42:02.160]  policies and when those employees are sick and they go to the treatment centers that that that
[02:42:02.160 --> 02:42:08.080]  those business people actually also own they get a payout when you die too they're not telling us
[02:42:08.080 --> 02:42:14.000]  any of that they don't tell us how the how the stock markets really work and who owns them you
[02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:19.920]  know somebody owns the stock markets when the stock markets goes up that means a whole bunch of
[02:42:19.920 --> 02:42:28.000]  people lost their money and their jobs nobody knows that it's all bullshit i said when i ran for

[02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:07.760]  it's alex jones
[02:47:13.280 --> 02:47:19.760]  you can't run on for a long time run on for a long time
[02:47:21.200 --> 02:47:24.880]  you can't run on for a long time
[02:47:24.880 --> 02:47:27.840]  run on for a long time
[02:47:27.840 --> 02:47:36.400]  run on for a long time. Sooner or later, gotta cut you down. Sooner or later, gotta cut you down.
[02:47:36.400 --> 02:47:39.280]  All right, Roseanne will host a little bit of this in the next hour. She wants to take
[02:47:39.280 --> 02:47:44.480]  these callers, Steve and Eric and John and Craig and Christine. I'll try to get everybody else as
[02:47:44.480 --> 02:47:50.560]  well. We appreciate you all, Joshua and Louisiana, but she wanted to talk directly to the New World
[02:47:50.560 --> 02:48:01.120]  Order and give them a message right now. Roseanne Barr. I wanted to talk about these devil worshipers
[02:48:01.120 --> 02:48:11.920]  and such that took the Bible and everything that's holy to me and reversed it, you know, and stole
[02:48:11.920 --> 02:48:20.240]  from my people and such and stole everything holy and turned it upside down and made it do
[02:48:20.240 --> 02:48:27.920]  what it, you know, made it serve evil. And I'm not going to let them win over me and what's right.
[02:48:28.800 --> 02:48:33.920]  I'm not going to let them win because I don't know, all my whole life I was just like,
[02:48:33.920 --> 02:48:41.760]  knowing who they are and what they do to good people all over this planet. And I don't know
[02:48:41.760 --> 02:48:48.880]  where else, probably other planets too, if they could. I know what they're like because I've seen
[02:48:48.880 --> 02:48:56.880]  a lot of them and I know what they do. And, you know, I just can't let them win and they're not
[02:48:56.880 --> 02:49:04.880]  going to win. And they need to go back to where they came from. And every day I pray that they are
[02:49:04.880 --> 02:49:18.320]  sent there. But I do, I wanted to say this. 99% of what we see on this planet is just illusion
[02:49:18.320 --> 02:49:30.960]  and it's only 1% is real. And we have, that 1% is our strength and that's all we need to fight
[02:49:30.960 --> 02:49:36.800]  that dirty 99% of stuff that's like a veil over our eyes and makes us think that that's
[02:49:36.800 --> 02:49:43.440]  reality, but it isn't. It's actually a matrix. And we have a 1% chance of winning, but that 1%
[02:49:43.440 --> 02:49:52.800]  chance is where God is and so that's all we need. And I just love that idea that all we have is a
[02:49:52.800 --> 02:50:00.800]  1% chance, but in that 1% is all the intelligence, all the power and all the goodness and love
[02:50:02.160 --> 02:50:10.480]  we need to win and it's all inside us. Maybe it's dormant, but I think that the more hardship
[02:50:10.480 --> 02:50:18.160]  and fire we face, the stronger we get and the stronger the flame within us grows until it becomes
[02:50:20.480 --> 02:50:28.720]  a fire. Undoubtedly. It sets the whole planet ablaze. I just feel that more and more every
[02:50:28.720 --> 02:50:36.640]  time I go out, I just feel it's stronger and stronger, the spirit of goodness in people to
[02:50:36.640 --> 02:50:42.400]  will something good, something better to know that it's possible. You're right. It's a choice and
[02:50:42.400 --> 02:50:47.120]  I want to say this. My phone is flooded by a lot of really cool people. A lot of them are household
[02:50:47.120 --> 02:50:52.080]  names and they say things like watching Roseanne borrow on your show right now. She's awesome.
[02:50:52.080 --> 02:50:56.400]  Love this side of her. You said to me when we went to dinner when you're on a week and a half ago
[02:50:56.400 --> 02:51:00.480]  and we were at Joe Rogan's opening last week at the mothership. It was great hanging out with him
[02:51:00.480 --> 02:51:05.760]  as well. You said that, well, I was never a fake me, but it was more the comedy me. I kind of hid
[02:51:05.760 --> 02:51:11.360]  who I really was. This is the real me and I think people really love seeing the real you. It's very
[02:51:11.360 --> 02:51:15.840]  thought provoking, very deep and absolutely on. Can you speak to that? Why you're suddenly really,
[02:51:16.640 --> 02:51:19.840]  you said you were scared to really be the real you. Now you're here. It's beautiful.
[02:51:23.680 --> 02:51:29.040]  Well, when I was just a little girl, I just wrote about this. They asked me to write this piece
[02:51:29.040 --> 02:51:36.000]  for this book they're doing about how I know God exists in the world. And it's like an astronaut
[02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:42.640]  CEO scientist. And then they asked me, I was very honored. And how I know is because when I was a
[02:51:42.640 --> 02:51:48.640]  little girl, three years old, my grandparents were Jews, you know, and lived in Salt Lake City,
[02:51:48.640 --> 02:51:55.840]  Utah. My grandparents, they sponsored all these people to come over from concentration camps
[02:51:55.840 --> 02:52:05.040]  in Europe, but they sponsored about 30 different Jewish families. And they had an apartment house
[02:52:05.040 --> 02:52:11.680]  and they had them there. And every Friday night, we would have Shabbat dinner over my grandma's house.
[02:52:11.680 --> 02:52:18.400]  And that's how I started in show business or in being a comic too, because my grandma had this
[02:52:18.400 --> 02:52:23.360]  big window sill. And I used to be three years old, like my little granddaughter. She's only two.
[02:52:23.360 --> 02:52:29.280]  But I get up in the window sill and I'd sing and dance. I cried to be Shirley Temple and they'd
[02:52:29.280 --> 02:52:35.760]  all applaud. And, you know, I'd tell jokes and everything, do my act. And I loved when they
[02:52:35.760 --> 02:52:41.120]  were applauding because when they weren't applauding, it was very sad. They had numbers on
[02:52:41.120 --> 02:52:46.800]  their arms and they would recount horrible stories. I was only just a little girl and they would
[02:52:46.800 --> 02:52:54.880]  point to me and they'd say little girls like her, they point to me and they would say horrible
[02:52:54.880 --> 02:53:01.360]  things. I didn't want to hear. I was horrified. And I went in my grandma's bathroom and I closed
[02:53:01.360 --> 02:53:10.480]  the door and I was so horrified that actually in my personality, I had a split in my personality,
[02:53:10.480 --> 02:53:18.080]  in my soul. And I turned around as a little girl and I wrote this in my first book called Rosanne.
[02:53:18.080 --> 02:53:24.800]  My life is a woman. And I turned around and I saw this vision of a man on a horse in the air.
[02:53:25.520 --> 02:53:31.120]  And he pointed to me just like they had pointed to me. And without any words, he said to me,
[02:53:31.120 --> 02:53:38.960]  you're going to be okay. You're going to survive. And he said, he's always going to be with me.
[02:53:38.960 --> 02:53:44.320]  And he said, someday you're going to have an answer for every question that's in your mind
[02:53:44.320 --> 02:53:51.280]  right now. And I'm going to always be with you. And then he got really little and flew out the
[02:53:51.280 --> 02:53:56.000]  crack in the window. Well, what happened is I always felt him and I always was,
[02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:06.400]  that part of me always was with him. I never let go of that. And as I grew up, I had other parts
[02:54:06.400 --> 02:54:12.800]  of me that did other things. For instance, one time in my life, I found out I had four
[02:54:15.200 --> 02:54:22.640]  different prescriptions for different eyeglasses. It's kind of weird. Some parts of me were allergic
[02:54:22.640 --> 02:54:34.240]  to some drugs and others weren't. And anyway, so, you know, I did integrate in my 40s.
[02:54:34.240 --> 02:54:39.440]  But let me say this, let me interrupt you because let me let me just finish this.
[02:54:39.440 --> 02:54:45.360]  This is what I wrote. I'll get real focused here. But every time I would get this feeling like
[02:54:45.360 --> 02:54:52.240]  suspended animation all through my life and without fail, I would get this feeling to go
[02:54:52.240 --> 02:54:57.760]  down the certain road. First I walked and later I drove and I would always I would end up at a
[02:54:57.760 --> 02:55:04.400]  bookstore and I would go into this bookstore and I would feel a book calling to me like
[02:55:05.200 --> 02:55:10.640]  pulling me and I would go to the book and I would open it and I would always open it to the perfect
[02:55:10.640 --> 02:55:16.480]  page and there would be a perfect sentence. And that sentence would answer a question I had in
[02:55:16.480 --> 02:55:22.960]  my mind. I've done this all over the world my whole life. And when I would read that sentence,
[02:55:22.960 --> 02:55:30.480]  the hairs on my body would stand up. And later when I was older, probably in my 60s, I read when I
[02:55:30.480 --> 02:55:37.040]  was studying, you know, Torah, that that's when I came across that sentence about the hairs on your
[02:55:37.040 --> 02:55:45.200]  bodies on your body stand when they read or hear holy words. So then I knew that my whole life
[02:55:45.200 --> 02:55:54.960]  that I was always being led and always connected in that way. So that's how I know no man that's
[02:55:54.960 --> 02:55:59.600]  beautiful. So please let me say this. The left last time you were on made fun of this because
[02:55:59.600 --> 02:56:03.440]  they're cut off from God. And they don't understand that whether it was Einstein or other scientists
[02:56:03.440 --> 02:56:12.080]  they all have these same feelings. That's also in the Holy Quran. Then their Islamophobia would
[02:56:12.080 --> 02:56:17.840]  embarrass them wouldn't it? Well, what I'm saying is exactly is they make fun of this we don't care.
[02:56:17.840 --> 02:56:21.920]  People know that we're interdimensionally connected. We're amazing creatures. And what you've
[02:56:21.920 --> 02:56:27.200]  shared is beautiful. And it's so truthful. And it's what's connected to genius. And the fact
[02:56:27.200 --> 02:56:33.920]  that the left rejects God and these higher connections is what mentally ill. They make fun
[02:56:33.920 --> 02:56:40.000]  of the mentally ill the left. It's disgusting. Well, they define people that understand is that
[02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:43.440]  when they're the most mentally ill going along with a system that makes them wear a mask
[02:56:44.320 --> 02:56:50.560]  and take poison shots. They've done Alex. I love that you say that because the left is so
[02:56:51.200 --> 02:56:56.320]  so guilty of weaponizing the mentally ill. That's who they've got burning stuff down.
[02:56:56.320 --> 02:57:01.440]  They weaponize mentally ill Alex. That's who's all homeless on the street untreated to.
[02:57:02.720 --> 02:57:06.320]  Well, the fact that you're connected to God and recognize you have different aspects that
[02:57:06.320 --> 02:57:10.800]  that's totally true. That's in all of us. The fact you can be so real with people. It's so
[02:57:10.800 --> 02:57:15.920]  beautiful. Anybody rejecting that or attacking that, I feel sorry for them. They think it's fun
[02:57:15.920 --> 02:57:21.440]  to call me crazy. Well, crazy like a fox. How this crazy person they admit energized the whole
[02:57:21.440 --> 02:57:25.840]  global movement against them. They admit Jones, he spread everywhere. He's beating us. He's but
[02:57:25.840 --> 02:57:30.480]  he's mentally ill. He's a joke. He's mentally ill. He's an idiot. He believes in God. Why,
[02:57:30.480 --> 02:57:35.200]  he believes he talks to God. He Yeah, well, guess what? This guy that talks to God is kicking your
[02:57:35.200 --> 02:57:40.080]  ass because he though is me is way greater than he was in your world. Roseanne Barr, you want to

[03:00:29.760 --> 03:00:32.960]  Australia we love her to death but but Roseanne during the break she says some powerful things
[03:00:32.960 --> 03:00:36.800]  you've got a message to the new world order you said we're fighting in the penthouse they're in
[03:00:36.800 --> 03:00:44.400]  the basement King David talked about that explain it to him. Well we fight up here on the higher level
[03:00:44.400 --> 03:00:49.280]  in the penthouse of thought where they can't go because they don't know it exists and they're
[03:00:49.280 --> 03:00:55.520]  down in the basement so of course they're you know all they all they can do is you know spit
[03:00:55.520 --> 03:01:00.960]  upward but it lands back in their face they can't touch us they don't even know what we're talking
[03:01:00.960 --> 03:01:06.960]  about so to them as I always say genius looks like insanity to imbeciles.
[03:01:09.440 --> 03:01:12.320]  Perfectly said but repeat your powerful message during the break to them.
[03:01:12.320 --> 03:01:19.600]  Well I can't remember what I said Alex what did I say you just said kind of what you just
[03:01:19.600 --> 03:01:23.280]  boom you're like you guys got to figure it out and they all hunger they all know.
[03:01:24.560 --> 03:01:29.840]  Well I don't know if they know oh I said well they're all they're all I don't know why they
[03:01:29.840 --> 03:01:36.880]  choose to wallow in such hatred and and bitch well they hate God for one thing and and they really
[03:01:36.880 --> 03:01:43.280]  hate Jews and they hate Christians because you know their religion comes from Judaism and they hate
[03:01:43.280 --> 03:01:48.880]  Muslims because you know they have a connection to Abraham too they just hate anything that comes
[03:01:48.880 --> 03:01:54.800]  from Abraham and why is that because Abraham said basically hey there's only one everything
[03:01:55.360 --> 03:02:00.480]  they hate that anything's connected to anything and that there's any cause and effect they hate
[03:02:00.480 --> 03:02:05.840]  gravity they hate science for God's sake that's what they're really against they hate math and
[03:02:05.840 --> 03:02:11.040]  they hate science and they call fake science science and they call fake news news well that's
[03:02:11.040 --> 03:02:14.960]  it they hate they hate God they hate God they hate God they know God's in control.
[03:02:17.600 --> 03:02:27.200]  Well their God is the one below and they they like the one below but they say the one above
[03:02:27.200 --> 03:02:33.440]  don't exist well figure it out people how can the one below exist if the one above don't
[03:02:33.440 --> 03:02:37.120]  that is so powerful they worship the one below but say the one above doesn't exist.
[03:02:38.800 --> 03:02:47.600]  Hello they're whack don't you see you know they hate me but yet they go around and they don't
[03:02:47.600 --> 03:02:53.760]  understand I used to be a leftist too for a long time my parents my dad especially and my grandpa
[03:02:53.760 --> 03:02:59.200]  were leftist and I was very involved in leftist politics for decades and most of the crap they
[03:02:59.200 --> 03:03:06.640]  go around mouthing I had a hand in writing and they're just too dumb to even know that but I
[03:03:06.640 --> 03:03:13.600]  I disavow everything I I wrote for the left when I ran for president and saw the kind of
[03:03:14.400 --> 03:03:19.520]  stuff they do for one thing they're just as corrupt if not more corrupt they were let me
[03:03:19.520 --> 03:03:25.600]  ask you a question when did you convert they all work for monsanto when I saw how they get the money
[03:03:25.600 --> 03:03:31.600]  when I saw that it takes a billion dollars just to lose just to run for president in this country
[03:03:31.600 --> 03:03:36.720]  takes a billion dollars just to lose because it's all just about Greece and somebody's palm
[03:03:36.720 --> 03:03:42.000]  and graft it had nothing to do with the people of this country and that's what we're going through
[03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:46.880]  right now I always said it's all about taking public money and putting it into private pockets
[03:03:46.880 --> 03:03:51.280]  and that's what's going on in our country right now they are taking the public's money
[03:03:51.280 --> 03:03:57.040]  and sending it to the Ukraine where it goes into private so if you woke up if you woke up 15 years
[03:03:57.040 --> 03:04:03.200]  ago I would say your awakening is accelerating right now oh it's totally been accelerating since uh
[03:04:03.200 --> 03:04:10.560]  you know for a really really long time when I started putting pieces together when I ran for
[03:04:11.360 --> 03:04:17.920]  president and saw that uh they wasn't they had nothing to say about the working people of America
[03:04:17.920 --> 03:04:23.680]  I ran as a socialist for the Green Party and saw they didn't care about the working people
[03:04:23.680 --> 03:04:29.200]  I thought it was about the public I thought I ran on the fact that public money should stay with
[03:04:29.200 --> 03:04:36.000]  the public for hospitals schools infrastructures fire department police they they they were trying
[03:04:36.000 --> 03:04:40.640]  to send it out of America then and that's what woke me up I was like what about the American
[03:04:40.640 --> 03:04:46.640]  laborers and you know people getting paid decent amounts for Rosanne not going to interrupt you
[03:04:46.640 --> 03:04:51.600]  one minute break we're coming right back with calls for Rosanne bar in 60 seconds powerful

[03:05:58.080 --> 03:06:11.280]  Clashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[03:06:11.280 --> 03:06:17.040]  front lines of the info war. Christine in Massachusetts you're on the air with Rosanne
[03:06:17.040 --> 03:06:23.760]  Barr. Christine thanks for holding you're on the air. Well I wanted to start by saying that
[03:06:23.760 --> 03:06:31.520]  you guys are both my heroes but Rosanne especially me and my sister Paulette have always been your
[03:06:31.520 --> 03:06:39.120]  biggest fans and she had an aneurysm the day before the second lockdown since 2020 fought for 55
[03:06:39.120 --> 03:06:45.600]  days alone and then passed because of a hope that was perpetrated by victims of mind control.
[03:06:45.600 --> 03:06:57.120]  So when you speak out about MKUltra and people falling victims to this stuff it it really you
[03:06:57.120 --> 03:07:06.720]  know it resonates and I mean I had a shared a death experience back in 2017 when a friend
[03:07:06.720 --> 03:07:14.880]  of mine had passed and when I woke up basically I was healed and my first thought was well Alex
[03:07:14.880 --> 03:07:21.360]  Jones was right. The glitch in the matrix that kind of taught me that people only do to you what
[03:07:21.360 --> 03:07:26.640]  you allow them to do these people really don't have any control over us except for what we give
[03:07:26.640 --> 03:07:32.320]  them they feed on fear and that is their only power and when you take that away they're nothing
[03:07:32.320 --> 03:07:39.120]  and they fear the people that stand and look them in the face and tell them that. So one of the best
[03:07:39.120 --> 03:07:46.400]  you know things that I can basically you know say about that is you know Matthew five eight
[03:07:46.400 --> 03:07:53.120]  blessed are the pure in heart they're the ones you see God and you know that you said something
[03:07:53.120 --> 03:07:58.880]  Rosanne the other day that really reigned home and it's it's crazy because it's almost like we're
[03:07:58.880 --> 03:08:05.040]  all getting the same downloads but you said that we have to start by imagining what a better world
[03:08:05.040 --> 03:08:10.160]  look like and I don't think people have done that and I think a good place for them to kind of start
[03:08:10.960 --> 03:08:19.600]  would be by realizing that they don't they only participate in what they walk into so the second
[03:08:19.600 --> 03:08:26.960]  that you know you speak from your heart and you know you stand in your truth that you take their
[03:08:26.960 --> 03:08:30.480]  power away. Christine thank you for the call let me just say this we're going to Rosanne
[03:08:31.200 --> 03:08:37.520]  that's exactly what we're talking about here is when Rosanne says look up I almost feel bad
[03:08:37.520 --> 03:08:40.800]  covering the evil the globalists all the bad things are doing though we have that work to
[03:08:40.800 --> 03:08:46.160]  expose them instead of just staring into God and all the good things we can do it's a paradox
[03:08:46.160 --> 03:08:50.560]  it's a fine line we got to walk we got to expose them but we've got to build a better world and
[03:08:50.560 --> 03:08:54.560]  dream a better world and build something so much better everybody wants to go to that instead of
[03:08:54.560 --> 03:08:59.840]  just find the enemy which we should do we need to go build the new system but that's a a paradox
[03:08:59.840 --> 03:09:07.040]  isn't it Rosanne? Yeah we have to do both at the very same time but uh you know first thing we
[03:09:07.040 --> 03:09:13.120]  got to do is get right inside ourselves that's the big big work we have to do that you got to go
[03:09:13.120 --> 03:09:19.440]  look in the mirror and like be real truthful with with yourself and know yourself know what you've
[03:09:19.440 --> 03:09:25.760]  done wrong and be brave and strong enough to admit it and then ask you know ask the people you've
[03:09:25.760 --> 03:09:32.800]  harmed to forgive you and make recompense for what you've done wrong apologize only a soul
[03:09:32.800 --> 03:09:40.560]  can apologize and change somebody who ain't got a soul cannot do that so that's like the first step
[03:09:40.560 --> 03:09:47.120]  and then the second step is to after you got right with yourself you have the ability to look
[03:09:47.120 --> 03:09:52.800]  outside of yourself you can never look outside yourself till you're right inside yourself you
[03:09:52.800 --> 03:09:59.120]  just use people as props when you ain't right inside but when you are right inside you have empathy
[03:09:59.120 --> 03:10:05.440]  for other people and you can go out and say do you need some help like you you know you can do for
[03:10:05.440 --> 03:10:10.400]  other people once you're okay you can't do for exactly until you're controlling yourself you
[03:10:10.400 --> 03:10:17.360]  can't interconnect craig in washington you only hear rosen bar go ahead hey rosen alex good to
[03:10:17.360 --> 03:10:23.680]  good to talk to you um i just want i'd love rosen to hear kind of uh you to expand on you talked
[03:10:23.680 --> 03:10:29.280]  about the machinery i i'm a big rudolf steiner fan and he called the devil aramon which is
[03:10:29.280 --> 03:10:36.640]  burro astrid but talked about you know this materialistic world and how it how it gets to us
[03:10:36.640 --> 03:10:41.760]  you know and uh the devil's devil shows up in machinery and the devil is in a silicon chip
[03:10:41.760 --> 03:10:48.320]  it doesn't mean we can't use it for good but you know that's that's the house the house like a casino
[03:10:48.320 --> 03:10:52.800]  is tipped towards the devil technology can be used but it's like a ring of mordor it's very dangerous
[03:10:53.680 --> 03:10:59.360]  yep and a alex and i've got a great t-shirt or slogan for you and this kind of fits in if you
[03:10:59.360 --> 03:11:05.760]  want to love the world make it lovely so that's beautiful what do you want to say to rosen i
[03:11:05.760 --> 03:11:10.480]  just i'd love to hear her she talked about the machinery and the in kind of the devil i'd love
[03:11:10.480 --> 03:11:14.880]  to hear her kind of expand on that rosen thank you craig great great point i wanted you to
[03:11:14.880 --> 03:11:20.400]  expand on that was one of my notes talk about the devil's machinery talk about that okay i am i'm
[03:11:20.400 --> 03:11:27.680]  talking about poram because that's the that's kind of the inner story of poram uh when we say
[03:11:28.560 --> 03:11:34.720]  on poram when we say the bad guy's name we take this thing called a greger and we shake it and it
[03:11:34.720 --> 03:11:41.360]  makes so much noise that we drown out his name from history one whenever his name is spoken we
[03:11:42.000 --> 03:11:47.840]  do this thing called the greger but what people don't know is the greger is shaped like a wrench
[03:11:48.480 --> 03:11:56.560]  and the meaning of that is to throw a wrench into the machine that is our power we are throwing a
[03:11:56.560 --> 03:12:05.040]  wrench into the machine because we have the ability to throw the wrench into the machine
[03:12:05.040 --> 03:12:12.640]  and break the machine just by moving sound waves and making noise that's what we do
[03:12:13.360 --> 03:12:19.120]  because it is all strung together with frequency and words and can be taken apart the very same
[03:12:19.120 --> 03:12:28.720]  way i love rudolf strainer i love that you say that the machinery will serve us when we own i always
[03:12:28.720 --> 03:12:35.600]  say the means of production in on every level including the machinery when a person of soul
[03:12:35.600 --> 03:12:43.440]  ethics and morality is pushing you know the buttons of all the machinery it will serve the people
[03:12:43.440 --> 03:12:50.240]  it's because evil people are in charge of the beautiful technology that the human mind is
[03:12:50.240 --> 03:12:56.000]  produced when we get rid of their ass we'll be using it for good we'll be using it absolutely
[03:12:56.000 --> 03:12:59.200]  let's go let's go to the caller we got to move quick rosanne we can have you roam in 10 hours

[03:13:49.840 --> 03:13:56.720]  third temple for the antichrist would be built by the year 2030 and if you know the heavenly timeline
[03:13:56.720 --> 03:14:02.880]  the antichrist will arrive three and a half years before that and when i saw the four holy books of
[03:14:02.880 --> 03:14:11.040]  the 33rd degree of the scottish rite i was told that the antichrist would appear as a prophecy in
[03:14:11.040 --> 03:14:16.320]  the book of baruch and the dead sea scrolls it's called the attack of the shadeem and all the high
[03:14:16.320 --> 03:14:22.160]  ranking masons know this that the antichrist will appear with a false alien invasion called operation
[03:14:22.160 --> 03:14:29.200]  majority that will unite the world and convince everyone that there is a common enemy outside

[03:20:21.200 --> 03:20:26.400]  rosa and bar let's take calls quickly and move fast steven olympia you're on the air
[03:20:29.040 --> 03:20:35.280]  thanks alex i love your show um rosa and i'm a podcast host for retro media talk and we just
[03:20:35.280 --> 03:20:44.160]  love your show i grew up on it it's timeless iconic uh rosa and is is more funnier today than ever
[03:20:44.160 --> 03:20:51.520]  uh it's kind of a therapy uh actually for a lot of people now because sitcoms just aren't as funny
[03:20:51.520 --> 03:20:59.200]  as as they they were and it's a form of antidepressant in my opinion but uh the question i got is
[03:21:00.080 --> 03:21:06.800]  are you still in contact with any of your co-stars that they apologize for anything or have you just
[03:21:06.800 --> 03:21:16.160]  just separated uh from them completely rosa yeah i'm out of there no contact i moved away
[03:21:19.200 --> 03:21:24.240]  thanks for asking though thanks for your nice words yeah steve thank you for the call all right
[03:21:24.240 --> 03:21:30.720]  let's go ahead and talk to eric in ohio you're on the air rosa yes hello uh thank you both for
[03:21:30.720 --> 03:21:37.120]  what you do um what i'm wondering rosa and and you're a real inspiration i think there's a lot
[03:21:37.120 --> 03:21:42.080]  of people out there that would like to do something but they don't know what to do or they're afraid
[03:21:42.080 --> 03:21:50.240]  to do something and i think we need to come up with some way of collectively you know having a
[03:21:50.240 --> 03:21:57.760]  force of american people that can file loss you know we can file lawsuits and really have an impact
[03:21:57.760 --> 03:22:08.240]  and what would you think of creating an arm of info wars for people to join and you know they
[03:22:08.240 --> 03:22:14.800]  pay five ten fifteen dollars a month if we could get over a million people to fund this so you're
[03:22:14.800 --> 03:22:18.640]  talking about something like judicial watch and that would be great too but what about just an
[03:22:18.640 --> 03:22:23.120]  action thing to go to city council go to county commission go to the state house just to be active
[03:22:23.120 --> 03:22:29.680]  politically right yeah no we can we can definitely do that on an individual basis i'm just wondering
[03:22:29.680 --> 03:22:35.760]  if there's something we can do on a national basis to just flood our judiciary flood our
[03:22:35.760 --> 03:22:41.920]  representatives uh with you know what they need to be doing because eric that's a great question
[03:22:41.920 --> 03:22:48.000]  thank you i gotta jump the next person go ahead rosa just start talking to each other that's one
[03:22:48.000 --> 03:22:55.440]  thing that hasn't happened yet start talking to your damn neighbors let's go to tina and tennessee
[03:22:55.440 --> 03:22:58.640]  these are all great callers gotta move quick you're on the air but the spiritual battle in
[03:22:58.640 --> 03:23:06.560]  the council calls her with rosa and barre hi alex hi rosa and i just want to thank y'all for what
[03:23:06.560 --> 03:23:14.400]  you do um rosa and i wanted to ask you and the last guy that was talking about it i'm amazed i'm
[03:23:14.400 --> 03:23:24.720]  even gotten through um rosa and when you started experiencing um the spiritual awakening that you
[03:23:24.720 --> 03:23:30.960]  had do you talked about earlier of the hair standing up on you i experienced that um on a
[03:23:30.960 --> 03:23:41.920]  regular basis uh and also when you became council um how did you how long was it before you overcome
[03:23:41.920 --> 03:23:46.880]  that i that's right that's a great question so when you criticize jordan sorrows which is all true
[03:23:46.880 --> 03:23:54.880]  what was that process like sorry ma'am finish your point well i'm experiencing it i'm i'm heavily
[03:23:54.880 --> 03:24:03.840]  um targeted and censored and um you know just shut me down and like i said i'm amazed i even
[03:24:03.840 --> 03:24:08.640]  got through so tina's looking for inspiration she's being attacked on the truth how did you go
[03:24:08.640 --> 03:24:16.320]  through that four years ago when you criticize jordan sorrows well i criticized the obama
[03:24:16.320 --> 03:24:26.160]  administration too don't forget but uh um you know i just i just uh trusted god that he he was
[03:24:26.160 --> 03:24:33.440]  taking me out of somewhere where i didn't belong and you know it's it's hard to trust when things
[03:24:33.440 --> 03:24:39.760]  are going against you but you know and there's fear but sometimes you're taken out of someplace you
[03:24:39.760 --> 03:24:46.160]  don't belong so you can go someplace where you need to go you need to move forward maybe you're
[03:24:46.160 --> 03:24:51.840]  stuck someplace that ain't right for you even though you think you need it but you might be uh
[03:24:51.840 --> 03:24:57.280]  being led someplace better i think the whole world's waking up we're in a place that's better
[03:24:57.280 --> 03:25:04.080]  all of us together aren't we yeah i think so well we're able to be us well we're not out from under
[03:25:04.080 --> 03:25:09.360]  the enemy but at least we know the enemy sitting on top of us well we're sitting on top of him
[03:25:09.360 --> 03:25:14.720]  alex come on now we're sitting on well you are and i am a lot of but i mean the general public's
[03:25:14.720 --> 03:25:18.800]  just now figuring i'm in the general public i think they're just now a little bit behind us
[03:25:18.800 --> 03:25:24.480]  they're figuring out this thing sitting on top of them oh but we're not afraid when they call us

[03:33:24.000 --> 03:33:29.200]  absolutely loved him and with good reason he's a comedian political commentator and internet
[03:33:29.200 --> 03:33:34.400]  personality most notably recognized on instagram as take naps you can find him on other social
[03:33:34.400 --> 03:33:39.840]  media platforms now we've heard from economics experts financial experts over the past few days
[03:33:39.840 --> 03:33:44.400]  but the reason i wanted to bring bobby on in light of the current events with the banking system is
[03:33:44.400 --> 03:33:50.080]  his amazing unique ability to break things down at a cellular level for everyone to understand
[03:33:50.080 --> 03:33:55.600]  in bite-sized pieces and everyone really really resonates with his delivery so bobby welcome
[03:33:57.120 --> 03:34:01.680]  thank you so much for having me again appreciate it glad to be back it it's great to see you it's
[03:34:01.680 --> 03:34:06.960]  great to see you all right so we've got svb silicon valley bank all of this stuff happening in the
[03:34:06.960 --> 03:34:14.800]  financial world uh the stock market's going crazy and the world's on fire uh give us your take on
[03:34:14.800 --> 03:34:21.440]  what this situation really means for everyone well it's funny i was just out of the country for two
[03:34:21.440 --> 03:34:26.960]  weeks kind of taken a little bit of a detox and it just kind of reminded me that when i got back
[03:34:26.960 --> 03:34:33.120]  that all of these things just keep happening right in a row and it's like could this possibly just be
[03:34:33.120 --> 03:34:40.400]  by accident is this not a coordinated and step by step process towards a very clear common goal
[03:34:40.400 --> 03:34:46.400]  so this to me just represents yet another string of coincidences that all just so happened to fall
[03:34:46.400 --> 03:34:51.680]  perfectly in line with the grand agenda and the central bank digital currency has been the goal
[03:34:51.680 --> 03:34:57.040]  since the beginning we all know how significant and how terrible that would be and i mean i even
[03:34:57.040 --> 03:35:01.120]  heard alex talking about i think it might have been on yesterday's show talking about how hey if
[03:35:01.120 --> 03:35:06.400]  you want to get that uh that money that the fdic was supposed was uh was going to extend to you
[03:35:06.400 --> 03:35:11.440]  beyond that 250 well you might have to use it through this certain mechanism and we've talked
[03:35:11.440 --> 03:35:16.400]  about for a really long time how it's only a matter of time before things like food stamps for example
[03:35:16.400 --> 03:35:21.360]  or your tax return for example would be on some type of credit card and you can only spend it
[03:35:21.360 --> 03:35:26.080]  at certain places and of course they could just turn it off whenever they want so to me this just
[03:35:26.080 --> 03:35:31.040]  fits nice and neat in the pocket of coincidences that advance towards their grand agenda and if
[03:35:31.040 --> 03:35:35.280]  they can control the money and all of these other things that they've been able to clearly
[03:35:35.280 --> 03:35:40.720]  establish that they have control over to me it's just yet another in a string of of of
[03:35:40.720 --> 03:35:46.720]  events that show how in control they actually are you're absolutely right bobby and banks aren't
[03:35:46.720 --> 03:35:52.560]  actually immune to this system of systematic destruction so uh you know muscling out the
[03:35:52.560 --> 03:35:58.080]  smaller guys so that the bigger guys have more control for example walmart uh in australia we
[03:35:58.080 --> 03:36:04.160]  have coals and woolworths similar large supermarket chains or kmart uh they were essential businesses
[03:36:04.160 --> 03:36:08.960]  during the lockdowns because somehow it's safer to walk through a building that's had thousands of
[03:36:08.960 --> 03:36:14.000]  people walking through today uh rather than you know your mom and dad business down the road that's
[03:36:14.000 --> 03:36:21.200]  had 10 that that's safer uh and so you know bunnings another really big hardware chain here so the
[03:36:21.200 --> 03:36:26.880]  same sort of thing the big boys are allowed to stay but mom and dad are closing and small banks
[03:36:26.880 --> 03:36:32.800]  are not immune to that system they're cleaning up the ones that don't fit into the norm of their
[03:36:32.800 --> 03:36:38.160]  agenda or banks that have any sort of independence as far as uh what they promote or what they align
[03:36:38.160 --> 03:36:43.520]  with that you know if they're not in line with the woke agenda um and and it really is an effort to
[03:36:43.520 --> 03:36:49.840]  consolidate everything bring in the cbdc's bankrupt the smaller banks uh you know the bigger ones come
[03:36:49.840 --> 03:36:55.040]  in and buy them giving you only the option of a few big banks which we've already seen now we've
[03:36:55.040 --> 03:37:00.320]  seen this with the recent banking failures people in the u.s are flooding to major banks um so that
[03:37:00.320 --> 03:37:05.360]  you're eventually left with only a few big big ones that are in alignment with the agenda
[03:37:05.360 --> 03:37:12.880]  and eventually will only give you the option of cbdc's yeah exactly and it's it's funny because
[03:37:12.880 --> 03:37:17.440]  it's almost like it's so funny being disconnected for a couple weeks and coming back because it's
[03:37:17.440 --> 03:37:22.880]  every single thing that they say the opposite is true and it's it's it's true every single time
[03:37:22.880 --> 03:37:28.160]  and it's funny because i think it was biden that was like you know this is not a this is not a bail
[03:37:28.160 --> 03:37:33.920]  out for the big guys this is a bailout for mainstream and it's like a person that has 400
[03:37:33.920 --> 03:37:39.760]  million dollars in this bank is not mainstream this is a bailout for the big guys this is all
[03:37:39.760 --> 03:37:44.880]  of these silicon valley investors all the ones that are likely to push their agenda they lie to
[03:37:44.880 --> 03:37:49.360]  you straight to your face and tell you the exact opposite of the truth and then they're like oh you
[03:37:49.360 --> 03:37:54.800]  know the taxpayers are not going to bail these people out and it's like yes they are it's the
[03:37:54.800 --> 03:38:00.880]  exact opposite of what they say and and just like you said the the the primary agenda is
[03:38:00.880 --> 03:38:05.760]  a smaller group of people a smaller group of businesses is easier to control this is just
[03:38:05.760 --> 03:38:10.800]  going to make it seem that any small community bank which for the longest time was like the only
[03:38:10.800 --> 03:38:15.200]  way to fight the power so to speak well now nobody is going to trust those and they're like go ahead
[03:38:15.200 --> 03:38:20.080]  and put it in bank of america and wells fargo and chase and all of the big guys and by the way
[03:38:20.080 --> 03:38:25.680]  these are the exact same guys that helped create this process this process in 2008 they're still
[03:38:25.680 --> 03:38:30.400]  doing the exact same thing and they only want these banks to be in business and all of those
[03:38:30.400 --> 03:38:34.080]  other small ones are going to get pushed out just like you said just like during the pandemic
[03:38:35.520 --> 03:38:40.160]  so do you think that it's actually potentially a mistake all these people going and quickly
[03:38:40.160 --> 03:38:45.120]  pulling out their funds i mean it's clearly being coordinated to force people to do that
[03:38:45.120 --> 03:38:52.080]  so that we collapse the smaller banks right well it's funny when you when you when you
[03:38:52.080 --> 03:38:57.200]  understand the psychology of people at such a level and the only thing that you have to do
[03:38:57.200 --> 03:39:02.560]  in the world is basically just be a demon people are actually pretty easy to move in one direction
[03:39:02.560 --> 03:39:07.920]  or the other especially in mass so without without knowing further details of the exact
[03:39:07.920 --> 03:39:13.360]  orchestration of this event i would i would not be surprised if this was a coordinated
[03:39:13.360 --> 03:39:18.240]  attack through any of the any of the many different ways of communicating to people
[03:39:18.240 --> 03:39:23.200]  to be scared about something so how and why people started withdrawing their money could
[03:39:23.200 --> 03:39:28.320]  have been any number of a variety of different things but the but what is absolutely clear
[03:39:28.320 --> 03:39:33.840]  with 100 certainty is that by the time we find out this information it's already been in the
[03:39:33.840 --> 03:39:39.200]  works for months it's like if forbes puts it on the cover that this is the best bank like
[03:39:39.200 --> 03:39:44.640]  literally the number one bank what a couple of months ago for five years in a row and you got
[03:39:44.640 --> 03:39:50.400]  jim kramer endorsing it it's like all these people knew and the people at the banks knew all the all
[03:39:50.400 --> 03:39:54.320]  the executives that were withdrawing all their cash all the people that are in the know that are
[03:39:54.320 --> 03:39:59.600]  just slightly above your average retail citizen they all knew this stuff so who ends up losing
[03:39:59.600 --> 03:40:04.880]  in the end the retail citizen all of us that get the information last this is just one in a in a
[03:40:04.880 --> 03:40:10.400]  very long string of events that proves that they know what's going on and they keep winning consistently
[03:40:10.400 --> 03:40:14.400]  and then the taxpayers the one that has to foot the bill and then the other thing that's kind of
[03:40:14.400 --> 03:40:20.720]  interesting about it is you have all these other major banks in america that probably have the exact
[03:40:20.720 --> 03:40:25.760]  same situation as this and you have all these mortgages for example where like people like me
[03:40:25.760 --> 03:40:30.000]  i have a mortgage that's three and a half percent the inflation is considerably higher than that a
[03:40:30.000 --> 03:40:34.960]  bond is paying much higher than that those mortgages are basically underwater so i have to pay three
[03:40:34.960 --> 03:40:40.240]  percent over 30 years so i would wager that this is going to be used as justification to bail out
[03:40:40.240 --> 03:40:45.600]  those bigger banks as well so they knock this one out they destroy all of those community banks and
[03:40:45.600 --> 03:40:50.800]  then all of the big banks get the get the privatized wins and the socialized losses just like they did
[03:40:50.800 --> 03:40:56.320]  in a way it's the same thing on repeat yet for whatever reason despite how obvious all of this
[03:40:56.320 --> 03:41:01.920]  stuff continues to be your average everyday retail citizen will do absolutely nothing more than
[03:41:02.640 --> 03:41:06.960]  listen to exactly what the mainstream news tells them happen and then keep going about their life
[03:41:06.960 --> 03:41:11.200]  they'll strap their diaper on their face they'll go back to they'll go back to school or work they'll
[03:41:11.200 --> 03:41:15.760]  tell their their young boy that they can be a girl if they just take the right drugs and the whole
[03:41:15.760 --> 03:41:20.960]  process continues people being disconnected from the basics is why they can do this and slap us
[03:41:20.960 --> 03:41:26.560]  right when in the face with it over and over again it's so sad that people just don't pay attention
[03:41:27.760 --> 03:41:33.120]  you're absolutely right and then what happens is that the truth community ends up you know we get
[03:41:33.120 --> 03:41:39.120]  these narratives that they release at the right time and then we're spending our time debunking
[03:41:39.120 --> 03:41:45.280]  this forever on the defense rather than being on the offense and this is a conversation i had
[03:41:45.280 --> 03:41:50.000]  recently with michael yon alex recently had him on i brought him on for an extended interview i've
[03:41:50.000 --> 03:41:55.760]  actually interviewed him twice in the past week he's in the netherlands talking currently and
[03:41:55.760 --> 03:42:01.120]  attending the farmers protest there and you know the there's a huge attack on the farmers in the
[03:42:01.120 --> 03:42:04.960]  netherlands it's unbelievable to see what they're doing there they just want to destroy our food
[03:42:04.960 --> 03:42:10.000]  supply and meanwhile people are just oh well the price of eggs is through the roof i guess that's
[03:42:10.000 --> 03:42:17.040]  what we have to do to you know defeat putin or whatever um but but the fact is that um the truth
[03:42:17.040 --> 03:42:24.160]  community seems to always be on the defense we're constantly trying to explain why this is another
[03:42:24.160 --> 03:42:30.240]  psi op or another scam uh and meanwhile they've already planned the next stage they've they've
[03:42:30.240 --> 03:42:35.600]  already got it in motion and so i think that's why it's important to predict this stuff alex has been
[03:42:35.600 --> 03:42:40.720]  so great at doing that years in advance but we need more people to pay attention i want to talk
[03:42:40.720 --> 03:42:46.000]  more about that in the next segment we're going to go to a quick break stay with us um bobby can't
[03:42:46.000 --> 03:42:51.120]  wait to hear from you about how we actually get on the offense rather than constantly being on the
[03:42:51.120 --> 03:42:59.520]  defense stay with us we'll be right back the fight against the new world order is now the
[03:42:59.520 --> 03:43:04.240]  top story in the world the globalist are in deep trouble but they're striking back with all their

[03:47:12.080 --> 03:47:17.120]  we are back with bobby source one of the smartest guys i know and truly a stand-up
[03:47:17.120 --> 03:47:22.320]  individual bobby we're all for capitalism but this is not capitalism if it was capitalism
[03:47:22.320 --> 03:47:27.920]  we would just let these companies collapse without bailouts and without help you know
[03:47:27.920 --> 03:47:33.440]  people may lose money but it would tighten their regulations so in future they don't do dodgy things
[03:47:33.440 --> 03:47:38.080]  to survive as a company the banks seem to have this really sweet deal where essentially the system
[03:47:38.080 --> 03:47:43.440]  for them is if they make profits it goes into their pockets and if all and all their senior
[03:47:43.440 --> 03:47:48.480]  you know executives and CEOs get super rich and if they don't they get bailouts and buyouts and
[03:47:48.480 --> 03:47:54.880]  whatnot and you know you and me foot the bill and the execs still get their yearly bonuses you know
[03:47:54.880 --> 03:47:59.760]  the in the u.s the irs is tracking every transaction over 600 so the people are the criminals but
[03:47:59.760 --> 03:48:04.640]  the people that are orchestrating this are not so before the break we spoke about the fact that i
[03:48:04.640 --> 03:48:09.200]  see the need that we need to be proactive with things like proactively diversifying our wealth
[03:48:09.200 --> 03:48:13.840]  work on setting up a parallel economy you know so many people are talking about barter systems and
[03:48:13.840 --> 03:48:18.800]  and things within their local communities but you talk a lot about voting with our dollar
[03:48:19.520 --> 03:48:24.240]  how can that concept really get us out of this and and help us move forward and help educate
[03:48:24.240 --> 03:48:28.720]  those that aren't aware of what's going on because here's the thing bobby and i know you'll agree
[03:48:28.720 --> 03:48:33.920]  where they may not care about vaccines killing people or you know the fact that their children
[03:48:33.920 --> 03:48:38.800]  are being indoctrinated to that that they may not be the gender they were born or the doctor might
[03:48:38.800 --> 03:48:45.280]  have gotten it wrong they care about their money so this may be a really great opportunity for us
[03:48:45.280 --> 03:48:52.400]  to wake people up yeah i mean so i was uh when i was overseas this weekend i was in italy and
[03:48:52.400 --> 03:48:57.040]  what it it caught me a very important lesson as traveling overseas i think often treats people
[03:48:57.040 --> 03:49:03.120]  and what it reminded me or teaches people what it reminded me is that starting a business is
[03:49:03.120 --> 03:49:08.640]  kind of like the most common uh is like the most human thing you could do and we look at the we
[03:49:08.640 --> 03:49:13.760]  look at the world and we tend to think that the only way to make money is through some other system
[03:49:13.760 --> 03:49:19.360]  that's set up by other people but being in italy and seeing these tiny little shops and one guy
[03:49:19.360 --> 03:49:23.600]  sitting in the shop all day selling water or cigarettes or whatever it was and these tiny
[03:49:23.600 --> 03:49:30.320]  little imprints reminded me of what old world used to look like it was the individual created their
[03:49:30.320 --> 03:49:36.640]  own destiny provided a product or service took pride in it and there was 10 places to buy tobacco 10
[03:49:36.640 --> 03:49:41.680]  places to buy a bottle of water 150 places to buy a loaf of bread but each of them was fighting and
[03:49:41.680 --> 03:49:46.400]  battling for that dollar now what it reminded me and what it taught me and what i'm going to start
[03:49:46.400 --> 03:49:51.920]  pushing now to my audience is how important it is for all of us to think in that way think way back
[03:49:51.920 --> 03:49:56.800]  to the very beginning instead of looking at the world as this big thing to tackle figure out how
[03:49:56.800 --> 03:50:02.160]  to create your own income yourself i think more people should start focusing on starting small
[03:50:02.160 --> 03:50:07.760]  businesses that would service all of us and instead of looking at the world as this unobtainable
[03:50:07.760 --> 03:50:12.480]  gigantic thing that needs to be conquered instead if we just look at the very small
[03:50:12.480 --> 03:50:17.040]  micro economy between us and the people around us it's like if you were to be if you could just
[03:50:17.040 --> 03:50:22.320]  start a small business with the people that you know a side hustle some people might refer to it as
[03:50:22.320 --> 03:50:26.880]  this single-handedly would create that parallel economy even just in your local community or
[03:50:26.880 --> 03:50:31.760]  amongst the people that you know think about how you know here in america there's almost nothing
[03:50:31.760 --> 03:50:35.920]  that's made in the us anymore and there's this trend which i think is going to go certainly
[03:50:35.920 --> 03:50:41.600]  further in that direction where buying things that are made in america is worth that extra dollar
[03:50:41.600 --> 03:50:46.560]  because you know who it's supporting i think that what all of us should do is focus on them is focus
[03:50:46.560 --> 03:50:51.440]  on the micro start your own businesses provide services and products for the people that are
[03:50:51.440 --> 03:50:55.680]  around you and do the same way that they used to do it back in the day and start at the small
[03:50:55.680 --> 03:50:59.840]  and i think that that is the most impactful thing that we could do instead of being worried about
[03:50:59.840 --> 03:51:05.920]  this big daunting challenge that is the rest of the world i was just having a conversation with
[03:51:05.920 --> 03:51:11.840]  someone yesterday about the fact that people will pay more or pick someone that they know supports
[03:51:11.840 --> 03:51:20.960]  freedom because of the fact that it's more than just the effect on your pocket it's the fact that
[03:51:20.960 --> 03:51:26.720]  you're supporting something that you deeply believe in and so you know voting with your dollar or
[03:51:26.720 --> 03:51:31.680]  speaking with your dollar i think is is so important bobby and it's not too late people often feel
[03:51:31.680 --> 03:51:36.960]  like oh it's too late or it's hopeless now because it's all collapsing it's never too late uh if we
[03:51:36.960 --> 03:51:41.440]  keep having the mentality that it's too late we'll never defeat this thing so we have to really have
[03:51:41.440 --> 03:51:46.880]  this victory mentality um i often say bobby that people don't give themselves enough credit we are
[03:51:46.880 --> 03:51:54.400]  far more resourceful and far more creative uh than than we give ourselves credit for and i think
[03:51:54.400 --> 03:51:59.200]  that that's evident in the way that we've come out so much stronger after what they've done to us
[03:51:59.200 --> 03:52:03.840]  over these past three years i mean it's been going for a long time but particularly you know the
[03:52:03.840 --> 03:52:09.360]  acceleration of the last three years um you know all i see is strength and resilience growing in
[03:52:09.360 --> 03:52:16.480]  the people so this is the perfect time to take advantage of the chaos around us and say no we're
[03:52:16.480 --> 03:52:22.320]  not going to be defeated we're going to build something better yeah exactly and and the other
[03:52:22.320 --> 03:52:27.920]  thing too that it reminds me and seeing all the people seeing all the people in italy that were
[03:52:27.920 --> 03:52:33.120]  generally speaking very healthy it also reminded me that one of the most resilient things that you
[03:52:33.120 --> 03:52:40.080]  can do is simply eat the right food and all these people in italy are eating this fresh these fresh
[03:52:40.080 --> 03:52:45.760]  vegetables from all these small markets i didn't see a large grocery store the entire time i was
[03:52:45.760 --> 03:52:52.640]  there there was all this food readily available healthy food grown locally that's the small economy
[03:52:52.640 --> 03:52:58.560]  that's how they're able to stay healthy and stay in shape and i rarely saw a person that was obese
[03:52:58.560 --> 03:53:02.960]  whereas here in america you it's like the vast majority of people look unhealthy when you walk
[03:53:02.960 --> 03:53:08.720]  down the street so it was just like i i couldn't help but feel refreshed for the world seeing
[03:53:08.720 --> 03:53:13.520]  people like that and it just reminded me that you know who's the local food provider in your area
[03:53:13.520 --> 03:53:18.720]  does anybody even think about food like that here we are buying all these medicines and being unhealthy
[03:53:18.720 --> 03:53:23.840]  and consuming all this negativity if we simply change the way that we eat and and if you and if
[03:53:23.840 --> 03:53:28.800]  you don't see that opportunity around us be the person that provides that start a hydroponic garden
[03:53:28.800 --> 03:53:33.440]  grow some hydroponic herbs there's ways that we can create small businesses that not only help
[03:53:33.440 --> 03:53:37.920]  keep the prosperity in the circle of people that believe in freedom and away from these demons
[03:53:37.920 --> 03:53:43.040]  but also your health is kind of only thing that matters when you really break it down and i feel
[03:53:43.040 --> 03:53:48.640]  like that to me was the message that i learned from italy is that the food is the single greatest
[03:53:48.640 --> 03:53:53.280]  thing that you can do to fight the power is to be as healthy as possible yourself and it starts
[03:53:53.280 --> 03:53:58.160]  with food i just hope that more people realize how significant that is and if you were looking for a
[03:53:58.160 --> 03:54:04.000]  parallel you can parallel economy opportunity to me that's the easiest and most wide open one
[03:54:04.000 --> 03:54:08.720]  change the way that people eat and if that and anybody can do that you don't need to be a food
[03:54:08.720 --> 03:54:14.640]  scientist or a chef to do that take a regular everyday product like crackers and eliminate the
[03:54:14.640 --> 03:54:19.040]  seed oils eliminate the processed grains and weeds eliminate the sugar and provide that to the
[03:54:19.040 --> 03:54:23.360]  marketplace and even if you just sold it locally to your friend and family you could create another
[03:54:23.360 --> 03:54:28.880]  income for yourself and and build more resilience not only within your body but within your bank
[03:54:28.880 --> 03:54:34.720]  account when i worked in corporate i had a staff member who was an absolute superstar she was my
[03:54:34.720 --> 03:54:41.520]  best one of my best salespeople and she uh was doing a side hustle where she was sourcing food
[03:54:41.520 --> 03:54:45.920]  from local farmers and then delivering it on weekends and things she became so busy within
[03:54:45.920 --> 03:54:50.000]  a matter of weeks that she had to quit quit the job that she was working i mean she was one of my
[03:54:50.000 --> 03:54:55.760]  staff and so i was obviously devastated to lose her because she was brilliant but i was so happy
[03:54:55.760 --> 03:55:01.200]  for her that in this very very short time just with some social media marketing her business
[03:55:01.200 --> 03:55:06.080]  absolutely exploded the word of mouth spread the fact that she was supporting local farmers
[03:55:06.080 --> 03:55:11.200]  supporting local produce and delivering it to people in a region um you know she got to the
[03:55:11.200 --> 03:55:16.000]  point where she had to employ other people to do it within a very very short time bobby so these
[03:55:16.000 --> 03:55:21.680]  are the types of things that we need to be thinking about in order to overcome uh what what these
[03:55:21.680 --> 03:55:27.520]  people are trying to do to us um i guess where do you see the next couple of we've we've got about
[03:55:27.520 --> 03:55:32.160]  two minutes left bobby where do you see oh it seems that we've lost bobby okay well i'll just keep
[03:55:32.160 --> 03:55:40.560]  going um we've we don't know what is coming uh and obviously we have to keep watching and keep a
[03:55:40.560 --> 03:55:45.600]  finger on the pulse uh but it's clear that they're trying to collapse the system it's clear that
[03:55:45.600 --> 03:55:51.680]  they're trying to cause fear and panic which is the number one game plan uh and i really think
[03:55:51.680 --> 03:55:56.000]  you know that the words of michael yon from our last interview really stuck with me where he said
[03:55:56.000 --> 03:56:03.280]  we need to stop being on the defensive we need to start getting on the offensive and i guarantee you
[03:56:03.280 --> 03:56:07.920]  people will support i you know even with some of the partners that the z media has i'll be really
[03:56:07.920 --> 03:56:13.840]  upfront about this people have said to me you know i go to this business because i know that
[03:56:13.840 --> 03:56:18.880]  they're backing independent media because i know that they're helping get the truth out this is the
[03:56:18.880 --> 03:56:25.360]  mentality of good people this is the mentality of freedom loving people so you know we need to
[03:56:25.360 --> 03:56:32.000]  support one another we need to encourage more of this more people you know thinking of other
[03:56:32.000 --> 03:56:37.360]  creative ways to support local communities support local farmers everything that bobby is talking
[03:56:37.360 --> 03:56:44.720]  about is absolutely crucial and no matter what they do to us if we start now on a parallel economy if
[03:56:44.720 --> 03:56:50.880]  we start now on parallel systems then it doesn't matter what they do out there because we've got
[03:56:50.880 --> 03:56:57.200]  it happening in here focusing on the local community is key and by the way that's the other key to
[03:56:57.200 --> 03:57:03.120]  tackling smart cities you know lobbying local mares making sure that you're involved in community
[03:57:03.120 --> 03:57:09.920]  meetings getting your local people aware of what this plan actually is because the plan for human
[03:57:09.920 --> 03:57:18.400]  enslavement is very very real it's very very serious it's deadly in fact and we depend on those
[03:57:18.400 --> 03:57:23.840]  around us to protect one another from it we will not survive this alone and i see this is a huge
[03:57:23.840 --> 03:57:29.280]  opportunity to to keep going if you're not following bobby i'm sad we lost him but he's such a great
[03:57:29.280 --> 03:57:35.040]  great guy so intelligent take naps on instagram he's also on twitter get a whole range of other
