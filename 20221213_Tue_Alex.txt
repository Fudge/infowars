[00:00.000 --> 00:03.440]  Humanity is on a collision course with a horrific end.
[00:03.440 --> 00:08.520]  If the common people of the world continue to stall and allow the elite technocratic
[00:08.520 --> 00:13.680]  eugenicists to promote their psychotic agenda and their tentacles in government affecting
[00:13.680 --> 00:15.160]  our daily lives.
[00:15.160 --> 00:16.840]  We penitrate surcapinates.
[00:16.840 --> 00:22.440]  Klaus Schwab is the head of the World Economic Forum and he bragged how his subversive WWEF
[00:22.440 --> 00:27.240]  World Economic Forum has quoted infiltrated governments around the world in the interest
[00:27.240 --> 00:28.960]  of transparency.
[00:28.960 --> 00:35.200]  Could the member please name which cabinet ministers are on board with the WWEF's agenda?
[00:35.200 --> 00:40.280]  The member was in a really good question there but the audio is really, really bad
[00:40.280 --> 00:42.480]  and the video is really, really bad as well.
[00:42.480 --> 00:46.800]  Mr. Speaker, that member was promoting open disinformation.
[00:46.800 --> 00:53.080]  The World Economic Forum is pushing for a global ID by 2026 fueled by blaming the average
[00:53.080 --> 00:54.960]  citizen for their carbon footprint.
[00:54.960 --> 00:59.600]  Why is the World Economic Forum bothering with digital identity?
[00:59.600 --> 01:00.800]  Why are we looking into it?
[01:00.800 --> 01:02.680]  Why is it such an important topic for us?
[01:02.680 --> 01:08.360]  How we construct and use digital identities would determine how people are represented
[01:08.360 --> 01:13.960]  online, what opportunities they have access to, what or who is trusted online.
[01:13.960 --> 01:17.200]  So it's also a very important tool for financial inclusion.
[01:17.200 --> 01:21.840]  It's a starting point where a number of actors, you know, from the international development
[01:21.840 --> 01:25.320]  community and the private sector and everything in between have started to come together to
[01:25.320 --> 01:29.240]  think about what principles should be governing the use of these systems.
[01:29.240 --> 01:34.720]  Yet, not a word from the Bilderberg attending industries that continue to produce endocrine
[01:34.720 --> 01:41.080]  system hormone blockers within phthalates and bisphenol A in plastics to pesticides
[01:41.080 --> 01:47.000]  in our food to shampoo to receipts to water bottles to electronics to cleaning products
[01:47.000 --> 01:48.000]  and carpets.
[01:48.000 --> 01:52.320]  Regardless of the fact that the chemicals from these industries could wipe out the human
[01:52.320 --> 01:59.480]  race by 2045, as leading reproductive epidemiologist Shanna Swan and her team of researchers found
[01:59.480 --> 02:04.720]  that during the past 40 years, sperm levels among men in Western countries had more than
[02:04.720 --> 02:11.520]  halved and could deplete to zero by 2045 due to the toxicity of plastic.
[02:11.520 --> 02:16.480]  When did this stuff start getting into our food supply?
[02:16.480 --> 02:24.360]  The growth of these chemicals tracks with the growth of the petrochemical industry.
[02:24.360 --> 02:30.000]  So back in 1950, there's this better living through chemistry that everyone's talking
[02:30.000 --> 02:34.520]  about and everybody is just wanting everything made of plastic.
[02:34.520 --> 02:39.320]  That's just one example of the many chemicals that can affect our hormone system.
[02:39.320 --> 02:43.040]  When waves are breaking, they create these mists, but they're actually transferring
[02:43.040 --> 02:46.960]  microplastics from the ocean into the air that we're breathing.
[02:46.960 --> 02:52.960]  By analyzing air samples from two Auckland locations, Dr Joel Rindallaw's team of researchers
[02:52.960 --> 02:59.800]  calculated that 74 metric tons of microplastics drop over the city each year.
[02:59.800 --> 03:04.280]  And it could have consequences for our health because microplastics have been detected in
[03:04.280 --> 03:05.280]  human lungs.
[03:05.280 --> 03:10.680]  Furthermore, in a recent study, it was observed that the Y chromosome found in the male species
[03:10.680 --> 03:16.520]  is degenerating and will eventually disappear, leading scientists to hypothesize that a new
[03:16.520 --> 03:20.400]  male chromosome will eventually replace the Y chromosome.
[03:20.400 --> 03:25.640]  Meanwhile, the replacement for the labor of mankind is here, as a turning point has been
[03:25.640 --> 03:31.440]  reached in robotic AI technology, allowing robots to see objects of varying shapes and
[03:31.440 --> 03:34.720]  sizes and adjust their grasp accordingly.
[03:34.720 --> 03:38.040]  This will rapidly replace millions of workers.
[03:38.040 --> 03:43.080]  As world economic forum-tainted areas lead the way on pushing people to commit suicide
[03:43.080 --> 03:45.800]  for merely being a burden on the state.
[03:45.800 --> 03:49.120]  Imagine choosing death over homelessness.
[03:49.120 --> 03:52.080]  That's what one St. Catherine's man is contemplating.
[03:52.080 --> 03:56.520]  Tonight on City News, we continue to delve into medically assisted dying and how some
[03:56.520 --> 04:00.520]  believe it is their only option to living in poverty.
[04:00.520 --> 04:06.800]  All of these and many more major crises that face the future of humanity are tacitly collected
[04:06.800 --> 04:12.360]  under the net of the New World Order by its assets in the World Economic Forum in the United
[04:12.360 --> 04:13.360]  Nations.
[04:13.360 --> 04:19.640]  Rather than allow the populace to properly face their fate, the architects protecting
[04:19.640 --> 04:26.920]  global corporate interests pose as our saviors, projecting steadfast organization.
[04:26.920 --> 04:31.600]  Now the United Nations is warning the coronavirus crisis has put the world on the brink of a
[04:31.600 --> 04:33.280]  hunger pandemic.
[04:33.280 --> 04:38.880]  265 million people could face acute food shortages by the end of the year.
[04:38.880 --> 04:41.840]  That is double last year's projections.
[04:41.840 --> 04:48.840]  While rapidly fomenting order out of chaos, humanity must respond to this New World Order
[04:48.840 --> 04:53.280]  dogma or vanish under the boot of the coming totalitarianism.
[04:53.280 --> 04:55.280]  John Bowne reported.
[04:55.280 --> 04:57.920]  Excellent report by John Bowne at Band-Aid Video.
[04:57.920 --> 05:01.680]  Share it like your life depends on it.
[05:01.680 --> 05:05.120]  Starting our new incredible supplement line in Four Wars MD.
[05:05.120 --> 05:09.600]  Now in 60 seconds, it's hard to tell you how incredible these products are.
[05:09.600 --> 05:15.360]  But all of these products are already sold on store shelves under other brand names for
[05:15.360 --> 05:18.240]  up to twice the cost we're selling it to you.
[05:18.240 --> 05:19.240]  These are high-end.
[05:19.240 --> 05:20.680]  These are the very best.
[05:20.680 --> 05:22.680]  You know our body's ultimate tumor formula is amazing?
[05:22.680 --> 05:23.680]  Well, guess what?
[05:23.680 --> 05:30.520]  We now have Turmeric 95 that's based in the same formula for a lower price, CBD oil of
[05:30.520 --> 05:37.120]  the highest quality, up to 50% less than major competitors selling the exact high-quality
[05:37.120 --> 05:38.120]  full-spectrum CBD.
[05:38.120 --> 05:44.160]  And it goes on for all the new M4Wars MD products at m4warstore.com.
[05:44.160 --> 05:51.320]  The highest quality directly from the manufacturer to your door at prices up to 50% in some cases
[05:51.320 --> 06:09.720]  100% lower than what they're sold for in stores, M4Wars MD at m4warstore.com.
[06:09.720 --> 06:32.000]  You see, we've messed up conservatives.
[06:32.000 --> 06:34.960]  I'm going to give you guys a little dose of reality.
[06:34.960 --> 06:42.080]  We've given too much power to big tech because we've allowed them to control the narrative.
[06:42.080 --> 06:47.720]  But we've also allowed them to control the narrative because we stay on their platforms.
[06:47.720 --> 06:48.720]  And that is a problem.
[06:48.720 --> 06:52.760]  I want you all to know something, Alex Jones was right.
[06:52.760 --> 07:00.600]  This is an information war.
[07:00.600 --> 07:02.520]  And we're losing.
[07:02.520 --> 07:04.160]  We're losing.
[07:04.160 --> 07:06.680]  But we don't have to be losing, okay?
[07:06.680 --> 07:08.560]  It's totally different.
[07:08.560 --> 07:14.800]  This is something that we can all win when we decide that their narrative is wrong.
[07:14.800 --> 07:17.880]  And their narrative doesn't have to control us anymore.
[07:17.880 --> 07:18.880]  That's right.
[07:18.880 --> 07:25.640]  And anybody they attack and try to shut down is somebody to message they fear and is somebody
[07:25.640 --> 07:29.160]  that we should rally around, ladies and gentlemen.
[07:29.160 --> 07:34.720]  The reason I started the broadcast today with that is without even looking, I see clips
[07:34.720 --> 07:39.400]  all over the internet of big public events.
[07:39.400 --> 07:43.400]  One of them was the recent large comedy show in liberal downtown Austin.
[07:43.400 --> 07:46.520]  And the comedian was attacking me.
[07:46.520 --> 07:51.400]  But when he said my name, it was resounding cheers.
[07:51.400 --> 07:54.680]  And that happens almost everywhere.
[07:54.680 --> 08:01.520]  And they try to sell the idea that info wars is unpopular, but it is overwhelmingly popular,
[08:01.520 --> 08:02.520]  not unpopular.
[08:02.520 --> 08:05.240]  The same thing happened with Elon Musk.
[08:05.240 --> 08:08.400]  He got a big round of applause and then a few people booed and the media cut out the
[08:08.400 --> 08:10.160]  booing and said, oh, look, he got booed.
[08:10.160 --> 08:13.640]  But the truth is what Musk is doing is overwhelmingly popular.
[08:13.640 --> 08:19.520]  But even if what I was doing wasn't popular and wasn't common sense and wasn't for safety
[08:19.520 --> 08:27.640]  and prosperity and family and God, even if I wasn't popular doing that, I would still
[08:27.640 --> 08:32.360]  do it because it is the right thing to do.
[08:32.360 --> 08:37.800]  You see, Mark Twain said it best in the beginning, a patriot's a scarce man, hated, feared and
[08:37.800 --> 08:38.800]  scorned.
[08:38.800 --> 08:43.960]  But in time, when this cause succeeds, the Tim would join him because then it cost nothing
[08:43.960 --> 08:44.960]  to be a patriot.
[08:44.960 --> 08:48.680]  It's been my job and your job, you've done a great job to hit the barbed wire and to
[08:48.680 --> 08:54.280]  talk about the painful truths and the realities that this corrupt system does not want us
[08:54.280 --> 08:56.040]  to know.
[08:56.040 --> 09:03.240]  That said, all opposition and all ideas that are anti-New World Order do not necessarily
[09:03.240 --> 09:08.520]  mean in my humble summation that they're good ideas either.
[09:08.520 --> 09:12.760]  And there are a lot of people out there that have a lot of good ideas but also mix in some
[09:12.760 --> 09:21.440]  bad ideas and it's not censorship when we disagree with those ideas.
[09:21.440 --> 09:29.720]  It's called good, healthy debate and that's what I'm doing here on this broadcast.
[09:29.720 --> 09:35.120]  Nick Fuentes, I talked to him Sunday, said he was happy to come here today and be in
[09:35.120 --> 09:40.200]  studio with us but something came up, I understand that, so he can't be in studio with us.
[09:40.200 --> 09:46.840]  He offered to come tomorrow but we've got a bunch of big scientists and doctors and
[09:46.840 --> 09:54.160]  experts, actuary experts on who were at Senator Ron Johnson's critical COVID-19 hearings that
[09:54.160 --> 09:55.160]  have now concluded.
[09:55.160 --> 09:58.480]  And so I've got those guests on tomorrow that I can't move so I would love to have Nick
[09:58.480 --> 10:05.120]  Fuentes in studio but the show is full tomorrow on the Wednesday transmission.
[10:05.120 --> 10:10.880]  So Nick will be on via Skype or Zoom, I'm not sure what he's using, in the third and
[10:10.880 --> 10:18.040]  fourth hour today I'll be hosting all four hours of the broadcast and look, I'm billing
[10:18.040 --> 10:23.160]  this as a debate because we will debate some issues but I think Nick's funny, I think he's
[10:23.160 --> 10:28.600]  smart, I have liked Nick Fuentes in the past and I've seen clips of him saying he doesn't
[10:28.600 --> 10:33.000]  like Hitler and then he's not anti-Semitic and so that's why I was a little taken back
[10:33.000 --> 10:37.360]  when he was here on the air and basically agreed with what Kanye was saying and look,
[10:37.360 --> 10:43.200]  I like Yale overall as well, I get that he was trying to burn down the world, burn down
[10:43.200 --> 10:48.080]  the censors and just go right to what you're not supposed to say and I still think he means
[10:48.080 --> 10:54.240]  well but I have my right to disagree with that and it's not because I got a phone call
[10:54.240 --> 10:59.880]  from the ADL, the ADL is my enemy and as I said I'm their number one enemy at every
[10:59.880 --> 11:03.880]  conference they have and I've been battling publicly and behind the scenes to silence
[11:03.880 --> 11:07.040]  this broadcast because I'm doing something they don't want.
[11:07.040 --> 11:12.680]  I'm trying to fight their race-based politics where they're the main group along with the
[11:12.680 --> 11:17.160]  Southern Poverty Law Center, their close second that are teaching that white people are inherently
[11:17.160 --> 11:23.920]  evil and that Christians are inherently bad and it is the most racist, bigoted, hateful
[11:23.920 --> 11:31.120]  organization in America and it lives off of division and it lives off vulcanization and
[11:31.120 --> 11:36.120]  it doesn't want us to come together against the policies of the New World Order.
[11:36.120 --> 11:43.920]  So I'm a big tent here for Christian and Muslim and Jew and agnostic, straight, gay, old, young,
[11:43.920 --> 11:49.120]  black, white, Hispanic, Asian as long as you're for basic tenants that I believe in, that
[11:49.120 --> 11:54.600]  is Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights, then I may disagree with some of the things
[11:54.600 --> 12:01.320]  you do and say but I overall still see you in a coalition just like gays against groomers
[12:01.320 --> 12:06.560]  that want to have a pro-human future and that's what we're fighting as a technocracy, we're
[12:06.560 --> 12:12.960]  fighting a post-human, trans-humanist system and obsessing over someone who's been dead
[12:12.960 --> 12:19.920]  for 77 years, Adolf Hitler and believing because he was in opposition to the Anglo-American
[12:19.920 --> 12:26.400]  establishment, that doesn't mean white people, that's what Putin calls the West, the Anglo-Americans.
[12:26.400 --> 12:30.640]  That's what the Harvard calls the globalist establishment, that's what Carol Quigley called
[12:30.640 --> 12:31.640]  it.
[12:31.640 --> 12:36.960]  It just means the British Empire in the United States and around the world the British Empire
[12:36.960 --> 12:43.280]  was called the Anglos or the Anglophiles and that actually goes back to a tribe over 1500
[12:43.280 --> 12:50.720]  years ago that began defeating the Romans in Europe and then it took over what is the
[12:50.720 --> 12:56.680]  UK today over a thousand years ago and then finally complete control of William the Conqueror.
[12:56.680 --> 13:02.120]  So when I use terms like that I'm not like the ADL saying white people and Anglos are
[13:02.120 --> 13:10.160]  the enemy, Anglos in that term comes from a Viking Germanic tribe that dominated and
[13:10.160 --> 13:16.760]  controlled Europe and defeated the Romans and let a coalition of groups to defeat the
[13:16.760 --> 13:21.360]  Romans later and the sacking of Rome and so if you want to know where England's history
[13:21.360 --> 13:28.280]  comes from and what's unfolding there and who King Arthur was and all of that, it's
[13:28.280 --> 13:35.240]  important to understand the anthropological and historical roots of all of this.
[13:35.240 --> 13:39.800]  So I'm going to try to be serious when Nick is on.
[13:39.800 --> 13:45.640]  Nick is funny, so am I and I like to joke around and I'm going to really try to be very serious
[13:45.640 --> 13:49.920]  with him because this is a serious issue and a serious topic and the media when I made
[13:49.920 --> 13:57.120]  jokes about Nick and about Yee, Yee also took that stuff out of context to try to create
[13:57.120 --> 14:02.000]  more division and that is not what I'm trying to do and I'll be quite frank with you.
[14:02.000 --> 14:06.480]  I don't think Nick Fuentes on a scale of 1 to 10 if promoting racial division and things
[14:06.480 --> 14:13.560]  like that is a bad thing, he's about a 1 and the ADL is about an 11, they're off the chart
[14:13.560 --> 14:18.600]  so they can't point their finger at Yee who never bought a single Nazi into the United
[14:18.600 --> 14:23.520]  States when her own government brought more than 35,000 in here in Operation Paperclip
[14:23.520 --> 14:28.320]  and the Rat Line and when George Soros helped round up Jews against all these ADL awards,
[14:28.320 --> 14:38.720]  they really have no position to moralize to anybody but I have here in my stack and I
[14:38.720 --> 14:46.280]  was looking for it again here it is on infowars.com, White House announces interagency group to
[14:46.280 --> 14:52.800]  counter anti-Semitism following Yee's firestorm against Jewish media.
[14:52.800 --> 14:57.560]  Now the federal government has already announced anybody questioning the government as a terrorist
[14:57.560 --> 15:05.240]  that is now officially saying they've got to mobilize to counter Yee and Nick Fuentes so
[15:05.240 --> 15:10.000]  this is definitely the clash they want and I just really wish we could think about that
[15:10.000 --> 15:15.920]  old 1980's movie War Games where the computer finally explains to everybody this is a very
[15:15.920 --> 15:23.560]  strange game, the only way to win is not to play and so that's what I'm trying to do.
[15:23.560 --> 15:32.520]  Alright, the big news in the next several hours is going to be massive, Sam Bankman
[15:32.520 --> 15:38.360]  Freed arrested hours before he was set to testify to Congress where we've got him on
[15:38.360 --> 15:43.640]  an Epstein death watch, we've got massive global announcements of the world's social
[15:43.640 --> 15:52.240]  credit score, one world government ID, actual newscast announcing it and so much more today,
[15:52.240 --> 16:00.440]  this is going to be one hell of a broadcast, stay with us.

[16:43.640 --> 16:49.680]  They are private labeled clones of the top brands in the country for up to 50% off where
[16:49.680 --> 16:52.840]  you're going to find them in stores and other online stores.
[16:52.840 --> 16:59.800]  This is our new Infowars MD credible line.
[16:59.800 --> 17:05.880]  December 2022 is here and we are proud and very excited to announce that free shipping
[17:05.880 --> 17:08.720]  is back at InfowarsStore.com.
[17:08.720 --> 17:14.440]  That's right, free shipping on all orders of $50 or more, but we signed a new deal with
[17:14.440 --> 17:19.960]  a big national shipping company and they're able to cut our regular shipping cost by
[17:19.960 --> 17:21.560]  up to 50%.
[17:21.560 --> 17:26.080]  So that means even on orders that are below $50 you're going to be paying way lower than
[17:26.080 --> 17:27.840]  you were previously.
[17:27.840 --> 17:31.960]  This is a game changer, we're so excited about it, our listeners have really asked for free
[17:31.960 --> 17:32.960]  shipping again.
[17:32.960 --> 17:36.960]  We couldn't afford it before, but by moving to a bigger national distributor we're able
[17:36.960 --> 17:37.960]  to do it.
[17:37.960 --> 17:43.040]  So now your orders will be shipped even faster, the same great customer service and more.
[17:43.040 --> 17:49.080]  So get huge discounts and free shipping on so many great items at InfowarsStore.com right
[17:49.080 --> 17:50.080]  now.
[17:50.080 --> 17:53.120]  I want to thank you all for your support, but now there's no excuse to boost your immune
[17:53.120 --> 17:59.720]  system, lead a healthier life and keep Infowars on the air, InfowarsStore.com.
[17:59.720 --> 18:05.080]  The tip of the spear throughout this entire process, the only thing that made any Republican
[18:05.080 --> 18:10.040]  victories tonight possible, the only thing that made any resistance to the war machine
[18:10.040 --> 18:15.680]  possible, the only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and
[18:15.680 --> 18:21.480]  the school shutdowns and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible, made any
[18:21.480 --> 18:27.360]  resistance to it possible was people continuing to support Infowars, despite the massive law
[18:27.360 --> 18:33.040]  fair being waged against Infowars, despite the media defamatory libelous campaign against
[18:33.040 --> 18:38.280]  Infowars, the ordinary people, the everyday people that buy products that make their own
[18:38.280 --> 18:43.760]  lives healthier, wealthier and wiser is what keeps Infowars on the air and what that does
[18:43.760 --> 18:49.320]  is keep the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian oppression.
[18:49.320 --> 18:55.400]  So continue to do it, go to places like InfowarsStore.com, go to places like Save Infowars, continue
[18:55.400 --> 19:00.520]  to keep Infowars alive because in the process, you're keeping American liberty alive.
[19:00.520 --> 19:05.560]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones, needs to support Infowars and
[19:05.560 --> 19:06.560]  band.video.
[19:06.560 --> 19:10.680]  You know, the Bible says, let another mouth praise you, I'm going to do that right now.
[19:10.680 --> 19:16.960]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry, you guys have no idea how many people
[19:16.960 --> 19:22.080]  have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez, how many people have just been put on a launch
[19:22.080 --> 19:25.960]  pad to outer space because of Alex Jones, including myself.
[19:25.960 --> 19:30.520]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform and
[19:30.520 --> 19:34.520]  I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[19:34.520 --> 19:39.360]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and Tim Kass, the super
[19:39.360 --> 19:40.360]  Tim Kass IRL.
[19:40.360 --> 19:46.360]  Listen, what I'm saying is do not take Alex Jones and band.video for granted because you
[19:46.360 --> 19:48.560]  don't know what you have until it's gone.
[19:48.560 --> 19:51.360]  We need to support free speech systems right now.
[19:51.360 --> 19:56.160]  So go check out the store, go support their store, go support Infowars, leave a donation
[19:56.160 --> 19:57.160]  right now.
[19:57.160 --> 20:01.360]  Don't wait until they're gone.
[20:01.360 --> 20:27.360]  Getting a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:27.360 --> 20:38.400]  I'm going to start drilling right into this critical news and information for the next
[20:38.400 --> 20:45.800]  hour and 45 minutes ahead of Dick Foynter debating me in the third and fourth hour.
[20:45.800 --> 20:54.040]  Sam Bankman Fried Freed has been arrested hours before scheduled congressional testimony.
[20:54.040 --> 20:55.600]  More on that in a moment.
[20:55.600 --> 21:02.840]  Tuesday live, Sam Bankman Fried at risk of Epstein-style suicide by elites covering up
[21:02.840 --> 21:04.240]  FTX scandal.
[21:04.240 --> 21:07.880]  I totally agree with Harrison Smith's headline for a show this morning.
[21:07.880 --> 21:13.240]  FTX founder Sam Bankman Fried arrested the Bahamas at the U.S. files criminal charges
[21:13.240 --> 21:16.880]  and they redacted out of it all the politicians and people they gave money to.
[21:16.880 --> 21:22.280]  Sam Bankman freed criminal charges unsealed, conspiracy to defraud the U.S. wire fraud,
[21:22.280 --> 21:26.200]  securities fraud and money laundering.
[21:26.200 --> 21:29.920]  Former FTX CEO Bankman Fried hit with eight-count indictment.
[21:29.920 --> 21:36.240]  There's silences deafening, stars including Larry David, Shaquille O'Neal and a whole
[21:36.240 --> 21:41.200]  bunch of others are totally silent about all the money they got to promote the pump and
[21:41.200 --> 21:42.800]  dump of FTX.
[21:42.800 --> 21:47.920]  Breaking securities exchange commission, indictment of FTX is Bankman Fried released.
[21:47.920 --> 21:54.160]  Any mention of the amount of donations from FTX to politicians is omitted.
[21:54.160 --> 22:00.320]  Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign CFO and Biden's head of SEC caught hiding meetings with Hillary
[22:00.320 --> 22:07.000]  Soros and Pelosi and others from his calendar, illegal to do that, but of course he helped
[22:07.000 --> 22:09.040]  run the whole FTX scam.
[22:09.040 --> 22:12.320]  What a nice person.
[22:12.320 --> 22:19.400]  And it continues, SEC chairman against scrubbed, we've also got more top DOJ official, Vanita
[22:19.400 --> 22:25.320]  Gupta admits to targeting conservatives following overturn of Roe v. Wade for criminal prosecution.
[22:25.320 --> 22:27.200]  They're just a bunch of terrorists.
[22:27.200 --> 22:28.760]  More and more of them are.
[22:28.760 --> 22:34.160]  Sam Bankman Fried hires lawyer who defended Gisling Maxwell and the whole Jeffrey Epstein
[22:34.160 --> 22:35.160]  situation.
[22:35.160 --> 22:41.240]  Boy, that sure tells you a lot.
[22:41.240 --> 22:47.840]  Not on the eve of his congressional testimony, which was going to be very, very embarrassing.
[22:47.840 --> 22:54.000]  He is snatched up not because they're going to ever really try to bring him to justice
[22:54.000 --> 22:58.320]  unless they kill him in a jail cell, break his neck in two places.
[22:58.320 --> 23:04.760]  No, because they want to control the information coming out because he was a deep state Harvard
[23:04.760 --> 23:11.280]  mafia globalist operative pumping tens of billions of dollars into Ukraine out of Ukraine
[23:11.280 --> 23:13.440]  back into their pockets.
[23:13.440 --> 23:20.040]  And then a lot of patriot organizations, not just here, but around the world exposed FTX
[23:20.040 --> 23:24.600]  in the last few months and brought it down a big blow against the deep state, just like
[23:24.600 --> 23:27.080]  you see Elon Musk going after them right now.
[23:27.080 --> 23:30.040]  He may be just wanting to take over the new world order, but he's certainly going after
[23:30.040 --> 23:32.160]  the dinosaurs that currently run it.
[23:32.160 --> 23:37.880]  It's bare minimum an inter-new world order battle for control of the AI technocracy.
[23:37.880 --> 23:46.840]  And I got a big announcement on AI coming up next segment, but this is a big, big deal.
[23:46.840 --> 23:50.080]  And they did it very, very transparently.
[23:50.080 --> 23:52.240]  They thought they were invincible.
[23:52.240 --> 23:59.720]  Bill Clinton, Maxine Waters, Barack Obama, the Securities and Exchange Commission heads,
[23:59.720 --> 24:07.920]  all of these individuals were over it, directing it, meeting with it, Bankman, Freed's mother.
[24:07.920 --> 24:20.040]  I mean, just all of the usual suspects were there robbing crypto investors while then
[24:20.040 --> 24:24.640]  using it to go after legitimate crypto and crypto markets.
[24:24.640 --> 24:33.360]  But the crypto markets recognized the contagion, the poison, and fried them first.
[24:33.360 --> 24:43.480]  So the new world order is learning that this is a two-way street in a big, big, big way.
[24:43.480 --> 24:49.480]  And there's a lot of other criminal charges coming out right now.
[24:49.480 --> 24:55.360]  So we all know Bernie Mannoff was a front guy for deeper grips, and then he sloppily
[24:55.360 --> 24:56.360]  got caught.
[24:56.360 --> 25:02.840]  So they had to control that and had to get rid of him and members of his family as well.
[25:02.840 --> 25:11.920]  We also have some of these other arrests that are now taking place, breaking notorious
[25:11.920 --> 25:17.760]  non-binary Biden official fired after multiple theft charges as all these warrants out for
[25:17.760 --> 25:18.760]  him.
[25:18.760 --> 25:23.400]  No one knows where he is right now.
[25:23.400 --> 25:32.600]  Another one, breaking disgraced CNN producer who is guilty to child sex crime, grooming
[25:32.600 --> 25:34.800]  and having sex with children.
[25:34.800 --> 25:38.880]  And then here's just some of the Hunter Biden laptop that we can show you on air.
[25:38.880 --> 25:44.640]  Just the president's son with his friends, nothing to see here, him in a towel naked
[25:44.640 --> 25:47.680]  with little girls sitting all over him.
[25:47.680 --> 25:52.280]  That's like drag queen story time, doesn't it?
[25:52.280 --> 25:55.600]  That's how this system works.
[25:55.600 --> 25:57.200]  That's their in game.
[25:57.200 --> 25:58.200]  That's their plan.
[25:58.200 --> 26:04.200]  Their currency is a destruction of children's innocence.
[26:04.200 --> 26:12.240]  Continuing, save your sons on Twitter, set it best, how to destroy society.
[26:12.240 --> 26:13.240]  Make art ugly.
[26:13.240 --> 26:15.680]  That came out in the CIA documents in the 70s.
[26:15.680 --> 26:21.600]  Make porn free, make God a joke, make food poison, make dads optional, make politics
[26:21.600 --> 26:26.880]  rich, politicians rich, make money workless, make buildings oppressive, make men and women
[26:26.880 --> 26:31.000]  compete, make children hate their ancestors.
[26:31.000 --> 26:32.240]  Did you miss anything?
[26:32.240 --> 26:34.960]  Yeah, poison you with deadly shots.
[26:34.960 --> 26:39.000]  And then the left spins everything with headlines like this one.
[26:39.000 --> 26:46.120]  Oh my gosh, how to ban 3,600 books from school libraries across the nation.
[26:46.120 --> 26:50.040]  They call it book banning and claim the right to censoring, no.
[26:50.040 --> 26:53.960]  They're taking books out of the elementary and middle schools and high schools that show
[26:53.960 --> 26:59.840]  pictorial graphics of little boys getting picked up out of their backyards and getting
[26:59.840 --> 27:04.000]  in vans with men that rape them and the little boys enjoy it.
[27:04.000 --> 27:10.120]  That's just one of many books that I have physically looked at that had the Austin Middle
[27:10.120 --> 27:16.000]  School Library tag on it last year.
[27:16.000 --> 27:23.520]  And I was traumatized looking at it and they've got books even worse that we will not show
[27:23.520 --> 27:28.080]  you here on air.
[27:28.080 --> 27:31.600]  But that's who these monsters are.
[27:31.600 --> 27:35.560]  We're going to go to a break here in a few minutes and come back with the really big
[27:35.560 --> 27:41.920]  announcements coming out of Italy, out of Australia, out of Canada, all back by the
[27:41.920 --> 27:50.720]  WEF, the official global social credit score system.
[27:50.720 --> 27:57.840]  And then I'm going to get into the fact that Elon really is freeing the captives, Dr. Peter
[27:57.840 --> 28:03.080]  McCulloch restored with no censorship or controls, those that are under control can
[28:03.080 --> 28:05.040]  see it on their dashboard.
[28:05.040 --> 28:10.400]  This is a big thing that Musk is doing because the deep states attack on tens of thousands
[28:10.400 --> 28:16.040]  of prominent academics, doctors, nurses and healthcare workers was how the deep state
[28:16.040 --> 28:20.800]  was able to get away with so much their lockdowns covering up the origin of the deadly virus
[28:20.800 --> 28:23.680]  and even more deadly Franken shot.
[28:23.680 --> 28:28.480]  And so I just have to give Elon Musk credit, you judge a tree by its fruits, I don't trust
[28:28.480 --> 28:30.800]  him as far as I can throw him.
[28:30.800 --> 28:33.520]  He has demonized me unfairly.
[28:33.520 --> 28:37.680]  But I'm not worried about Alex Jones again today, I'm worried about results.
[28:37.680 --> 28:41.120]  And in the aggregate, if I've got to be the sacrificial lamb for him to free everybody
[28:41.120 --> 28:44.360]  else, that's fine with me.
[28:44.360 --> 28:48.560]  So I really like the direction Elon's going at, at warp speed.
[28:48.560 --> 28:51.240]  He's moving very quickly.
[28:51.240 --> 28:52.720]  And I like the direction we see.
[28:52.720 --> 29:01.000]  We'll be right back at infowars.com tomorrow, that's it for today.
[29:01.000 --> 29:05.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, info wars live products have always been the highest quality, triple

[33:37.080 --> 33:44.480]  through a lot and I gotta say it's only made me stronger and if I had it all to do over
[33:44.480 --> 33:47.000]  again, I'd basically do things the same way I have.
[33:47.000 --> 33:50.200]  It's all been a great learning process and I love this crew.
[33:50.200 --> 33:55.040]  I love the audience of activists and we're, we're really fighting for the future of humanity
[33:55.040 --> 34:00.120]  and we've been proven right about basically everything we warned of and we have a really
[34:00.120 --> 34:03.520]  good chance of mitigating how bad the fight with the new world order is going to be going
[34:03.520 --> 34:04.520]  forward.
[34:04.520 --> 34:09.600]  We weren't caught flat-footed, humanity's waking up really fast, there's a lot of resistance
[34:09.600 --> 34:13.160]  forming and evil always gets defeated in the end.
[34:13.160 --> 34:16.880]  It's going to be rough, it's going to be exciting, it's going to be dramatic, it's certainly
[34:16.880 --> 34:22.360]  not going to be boring and when we get the Netflix watching crowd, which I watch Netflix
[34:22.360 --> 34:29.720]  too, I like Escape as well, but people that, like a glass of wine is good for you but if
[34:29.720 --> 34:33.200]  you drink four bottles of wine, you know, a week, it's not good for you and it's the
[34:33.200 --> 34:38.400]  same thing, so many people that are caught in the entertainment world and Marvel comics
[34:38.400 --> 34:44.960]  and all the distractions, you're living in a really exciting, crazy world for real and
[34:44.960 --> 34:50.200]  some really bad evil people really are coming for you because they think you're dumb unconscious
[34:50.200 --> 34:57.000]  animals who don't deserve to live and I could have joined these people, I could have been
[34:57.000 --> 35:03.760]  one of their top generals in the fight against humanity, I've been offered the deals and
[35:03.760 --> 35:07.080]  you could see they're smart, they know who to go after, I've been successful fighting
[35:07.080 --> 35:14.400]  them, they've been trying to hire me for 20 plus years and I've never joined them because
[35:14.400 --> 35:19.480]  I know what they're doing is wrong and they're losers, but I don't just need to intellectually
[35:19.480 --> 35:25.360]  or politically research all this and then come to my conclusion, it's in their own documents
[35:25.360 --> 35:32.360]  and I've met with them in off record discussions many, many, many times, people say why don't
[35:32.360 --> 35:38.320]  you talk about it, why don't I talk about it, what they support, world government, depopulation,
[35:38.320 --> 35:42.360]  the end of the family, you'll own nothing, you'll have nothing, you'll like it, it's
[35:42.360 --> 35:50.760]  in the open, it's not secret and I'm not going to get into all the offers, but I was
[35:50.760 --> 35:57.200]  offered a Fox News show and the yearly book deal from them and then after the globalists
[35:57.200 --> 36:02.160]  filed suit on me four years ago, I got calls my other top media figure saying hey, would
[36:02.160 --> 36:06.200]  you like to come to Florida and meet with some of the big guys, it wasn't Trump, it
[36:06.200 --> 36:11.120]  was somebody else, they'd like to work with you, they'd like you to grow up a little Alex
[36:11.120 --> 36:18.560]  or do you want what's about to happen next, so I've kept those channels open so I can
[36:18.560 --> 36:24.240]  know what they're thinking but I have to tell you, I've lived to see them on their heels,
[36:24.240 --> 36:30.440]  I've lived to see them in deep trouble, I've lived to see an amazing awakening and humanity
[36:30.440 --> 36:35.680]  coming out of a slumber and that is so valuable, it should no matter what happens to me, I'm
[36:35.680 --> 36:41.800]  right where I wanted to be, I'm doing what I wanted to do and I'm a winner, not a loser
[36:41.800 --> 36:48.280]  and I'm the real deal and they know that and they know you're for real and that's why
[36:48.280 --> 36:53.080]  they fear this broadcast because we are a congregation, we are a group of people coming
[36:53.080 --> 36:58.560]  together, that's what a congress is, it's a coming together of minds and we're changing
[36:58.560 --> 37:04.560]  the world and they fear you just like they fear me but I don't want the globalists to
[37:04.560 --> 37:08.160]  fear me, I want them to wake up to the evil they're involved in and realize they're really
[37:08.160 --> 37:15.740]  losers and to start making better decisions, now I know their top people are totally turned
[37:15.740 --> 37:19.720]  over to wickedness and that's not going to happen, they've already committed the ultimate
[37:19.720 --> 37:24.920]  sin and the Holy Spirit's been withdrawn completely from even trying to contact them but so many
[37:24.920 --> 37:30.360]  of their minions, so many of their servants, so many of their adjuncts and attachés and
[37:30.360 --> 37:36.920]  aid to camps are not pure evil and still have good in them and could turn from what they've
[37:36.920 --> 37:47.160]  been part of and so I have to tell you though I have almost no money in the bank, I feel
[37:47.160 --> 37:51.480]  stronger and more wealthy than I've ever been in my whole life, I feel proud of the hard
[37:51.480 --> 37:57.920]  work I've done and the travails and the tribulations that we've been through and I'm just so blessed
[37:57.920 --> 38:02.240]  and honored to be here with you, let me do this, next segment's the longest segment of
[38:02.240 --> 38:06.080]  the hour, we've still got a lot of time until the break but I want to hit this casual society
[38:06.080 --> 38:13.640]  thing because it's really of the three big pronged attacks, it's the key, the other attacks
[38:13.640 --> 38:17.520]  are to get us into this and then once they get us into this the real hell starts, so
[38:17.520 --> 38:26.240]  I'm going to do that next segment and then I'm going to go into the second hour and I'm
[38:26.240 --> 38:29.920]  going to cover more news and take your phone calls and then Nick Fuentes is going to be
[38:29.920 --> 38:36.920]  on for a debate in the third and fourth hour today but let me just say this right now because
[38:36.920 --> 38:47.000]  this is important, this is very, very important, when I say this I want it to sink into your
[38:47.000 --> 38:54.800]  mind so you really make a decision that's right here, I am in your hands, you are in
[38:54.800 --> 39:02.040]  my hands, we are on this ship together and it's really up to you whether I'm able to
[39:02.040 --> 39:07.000]  stay on air or whether we get shut down, the Associated Press some of the weekend came
[39:07.000 --> 39:12.680]  out and had an article in a video with lawyers, top lawyers saying Alex Jones wasn't given
[39:12.680 --> 39:18.160]  a fair trial, Alex Jones was found guilty by judges, Alex Jones must win this on appeal,
[39:18.160 --> 39:22.280]  no one can see how any appeals court would uphold these or there is no rule of law at
[39:22.280 --> 39:26.280]  America is gone, so people ask me how are you taking this, well that's exactly what
[39:26.280 --> 39:31.760]  I've said, I mean it's unbelievable what they did to me but that's because they're
[39:31.760 --> 39:39.040]  bad and they're corrupt and they're ruthless and they know they're losing control.
[39:39.040 --> 39:43.520]  So when I tell you that if you simply buy great products at infowarthorne.com we'll
[39:43.520 --> 39:47.960]  have money for the appeals, we'll have money for the special type of bankruptcy we're
[39:47.960 --> 39:52.600]  doing that is not a liquidation or a shutdown but a reorganization, that's why they're
[39:52.600 --> 40:00.520]  so angry about it, that's why they're now all over the news hoping well he must have
[40:00.520 --> 40:05.240]  hidden money somewhere so don't worry we'll put him in prison for that, no I don't and
[40:05.240 --> 40:10.000]  if they ever claim that or set that up I've been framed but that doesn't matter I don't
[40:10.000 --> 40:14.520]  fear them because I'm doing the right thing and I'm in a champion of freedom and I'm
[40:14.520 --> 40:22.080]  just blessed to be here, so the only variable in this equation, the only variable in this
[40:22.080 --> 40:26.720]  problem is you and I'm not saying hey you better support me or guilting you into that
[40:26.720 --> 40:30.320]  I'm saying you've already come this far you've already supported so much you already know
[40:30.320 --> 40:34.600]  how important this broadcast is and more and more people realize that this is the tip of
[40:34.600 --> 40:39.760]  the spear and the real cutting edge of intellectual understanding of the new world order and the
[40:39.760 --> 40:45.600]  new renaissance and the choices we have so please go to infowarstore.com where we have

[46:07.880 --> 46:14.360]  in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors they associated these poisonous
[46:14.360 --> 46:20.760]  vapors with cold weather of course it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people
[46:20.760 --> 46:28.840]  what was killing people was a lack of vitamin d3 you see the sun via your skin helps your body
[46:28.840 --> 46:35.080]  produce vitamin d3 but if you're not getting enough sun you will not produce vitamin d3 and then
[46:35.080 --> 46:39.560]  it's very easy for viruses and other things you start replicating and taking your body over

[47:20.440 --> 47:22.440]  you
[47:22.440 --> 47:24.440]  you
[47:24.440 --> 47:26.440]  you
[47:26.440 --> 47:28.440]  you
[47:28.440 --> 47:48.440]  you
[47:49.720 --> 47:52.840]  so the viral release
[47:52.840 --> 47:56.840]  the defunding of the police
[47:59.800 --> 48:05.640]  the purposeful collapse of the borders of the western world across the planet
[48:08.120 --> 48:13.560]  is all in the world economic forums own words and they're just the corporate mouthpiece of the
[48:13.560 --> 48:22.360]  global fascist corporate state and their own words is the pretext to create an angrier world
[48:22.360 --> 48:30.120]  and a destabilization so you will accept the world id card based on the global vaccine id
[48:31.000 --> 48:34.840]  so then they can implement the carbon tax the social credit score and once you don't have your
[48:34.840 --> 48:39.320]  job anymore your universal basic income where you have to behave the way they tell you
[48:40.840 --> 48:44.840]  and do what they tell you to do or you don't quote get the money which they also track and
[48:44.840 --> 48:49.800]  control and decide where and when and how you can spend it and how much value it has when it's
[48:49.800 --> 48:57.880]  in your digital wallet just like you see in the uk and the netherlands in germany and canada big
[48:57.880 --> 49:04.520]  time where they say sorry you've got a spinal problem and you're in pain we're not going to be
[49:04.520 --> 49:10.840]  healthcare anymore you need to kill yourself and they use the psychological tactic of we'll
[49:10.840 --> 49:16.840]  let you live one more year just agree to go to death counseling and we're going to help kill you
[49:16.840 --> 49:23.080]  and they control them through the pain pills and they say we'll give you the pain pills this is
[49:23.080 --> 49:29.000]  in the news there's articles all over about it and the articles are like is this right to do
[49:30.600 --> 49:34.440]  to their introducing to the public so they got people addicted to pain pills you name it and
[49:34.440 --> 49:39.720]  just yeah we'll give them to you another year just promise to kill yourself and then oh well
[49:39.720 --> 49:45.080]  we got rid of those infirm people but next it'll be you that's the slippery slope we've already gone
[49:45.080 --> 49:52.280]  over and so in italy in australia in new zealand in the uk everywhere they've been announcing
[49:54.440 --> 50:00.440]  the new digital currency that's going to be based on your smartphone a qr code
[50:02.280 --> 50:06.760]  and the basis of the whole thing is your vaccine passport remember what will happen last year and
[50:06.760 --> 50:11.720]  earlier this year in australia they'd say well in these different states these provinces
[50:11.720 --> 50:17.640]  is you have 15 minutes to call the police back when your phone gets called anytime
[50:17.640 --> 50:22.920]  of night or you get a massive fine or arrested you have to call them back on zoom and show
[50:22.920 --> 50:28.280]  them where you are to make sure you haven't left your house that's everybody in these australian
[50:28.280 --> 50:38.600]  states and they said we're getting ready for the social credit score and it's the same thing here
[50:38.600 --> 50:43.800]  so as tucker carlson said a few weeks ago they get this in place it's over
[50:45.400 --> 50:51.320]  you think sam bankman freed was ripping you off the same folks that run him are running this and
[50:51.320 --> 50:55.880]  once they get this they can rig the whole economy to consolidate power even more for themselves
[50:56.760 --> 51:02.360]  and absolutely control every fast of your life you see china where they oh i got a yellow code i

[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:09.880]  over yourself i believe that the majority of the plain people of the united states will day in and
[01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:16.120]  day out make fewer mistakes in governing themselves and any smaller class or body of men no matter
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:20.760]  what their training will make in trying to govern them and you gotta decide whether it's god that's
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:26.600]  gonna have dominion over you that you get orders from or whether some other human that's jacked into
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:31.720]  the evil force is gonna have dominion over you what we're talking about now is like a second

[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:44.840]  even weapons the product this time will be humans themselves do we want to have a human plan or an
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:50.280]  post-human plan no vol harari and claus Schwab and bill gates say humans are obsolete we're scum

[01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:33.320]  of god's order and god's will or do you choose to serve the agents of death and like martin
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:37.480]  looser king said we're not going to judge him off what color they are we're going to judge him off

[01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:38.360]  dr king don't dishonor him by using a congressional custom as an excuse for protecting our democracy
[01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:43.560]  but i tell me if you have a problem figuring out whether you're from miriam trump and you ain't black i

[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:48.040]  but let's get into fouchy and elon musk again i think the jury is still out on elon musk
[01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:55.480]  but the direction he's going is very very good so regardless the things that he's engaged in
[01:07:55.480 --> 01:08:00.600]  are very exciting he is freeing up twitter to a great extent compared to what it was he understands
[01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:04.680]  that makes it more popular that's good for business period it's unamerican to have all this
[01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:09.720]  fbi deep state run censorship and election meddling which is all now confirmed russian
[01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:14.600]  meddling was never confirmed it was all a hoax but deep state globalist meddling is
[01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:22.920]  absolutely documented so now with brennan and obama and hillary and clapper and all the deep
[01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:28.920]  state cockroaches have come out from under the floorboards to defend fouchy when rand paul's
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:34.440]  calling for his arrest when elon musk is calling for his arrest and saying the next group of documents
[01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:41.240]  he's going to release is the proof that we already have some other sources but even more powerful
[01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:47.880]  of fouchy suppressing thousands of scientists doctors and health care workers and major studies
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:53.880]  by major universities and institutions and governments about the origin of covid about the
[01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:59.240]  shots not working and being poisonous about them being a gmo gene therapy frankenshot

[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:48.920]  misinformation everything fouchy said was a giant lie someone's getting nervous doctor fouchy has

[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:17.800]  it was that they suppressed iver mekton knowing in the pentagon's own studies predating covid 19
[01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:23.160]  we're going to play some clips of that show you documents next segment knew that it was basically
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:29.480]  a cure 99 effective if you got it early and they suppressed it that is all coming up but first
[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:37.000]  let's play the latest chucky like and i say that because the last press secretary was a big liar
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  and looked like a female chucky uh and and now this this latest lady i like to call her the black
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:49.960]  chucky uh and so you know she's up there telling us it's time to play play with the truth fast and
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:55.400]  loose uh just how horrible it is to question our lord and savior fouchy here's the clip
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:11:03.480]  thank you great um as you know um elon musk launched a series of attacks on um dr mcfouchy over
[01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:10.680]  the weekend calling for his prosecution and then he shared uh some other uh memes about him and
[01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:15.960]  suggested he lied about he's lying about the origin of the coronavirus what's what's your response
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:24.040]  uh first of all to specifically to the attacks on uh dr fouchy and second uh how is your view of
[01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:30.600]  twitter as a sort of public forum and informed for yourself and from the president and many
[01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:35.400]  other officials here how how are those views evolving so like we've been very clear about this
[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:41.400]  these attacks these personal attacks uh that we have been seeing are dangerous uh on dr fouchy
[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:46.840]  and other public health professionals as well uh are they are disgusting and they are divorced from
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:52.680]  from reality and we will continue to call that out and be very clear about that again these are
[01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:58.680]  incredibly dangerous these personal attacks that we are seeing uh dr fouchy has served under seven
[01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:05.240]  republican and democratic presidents we cannot forget that uh he has given he has given uh his
[01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:11.480]  almost entire career to civil civil service all right that's enough that's like saying fidel castrow
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:18.840]  was in power for almost 60 years so he must be a great guy absolutely disgusting to see that clown
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:23.480]  up there but the attacks they're talking about oh it's dangerous someone might be violent they're
[01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:29.400]  now saying Elon musk criticized twitter's policy of allowing pedophilia and child rape which they did
[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:33.960]  he's going to cause violence against the people coming out these documents that allowed it to
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:40.040]  happen so they commit the crimes they do the bad stuff and then we're bad for exposing it everything
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:45.560]  fouchy said was a lie about how deadly covid was about where it came from about the shots working
[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:51.400]  and being tested to safe all of it a lie then they suppressed therapeutics then they kept people away
[01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:56.040]  from sick family members and old people so they could quietly kill them and pay them 51 thousand
[01:12:56.040 --> 01:13:01.800]  dollars for every person they murdered this all really happened remember we do remember and we're
[01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:07.240]  never going to forget let's start getting to this now that a whole stack of the aftermath of senator
[01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:11.720]  ron johnson's hearings dr peter mccullough who just got restored to twitter by elon musk is
[01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:17.240]  on with us the start of the show tomorrow 11 a.m central here he is talking about the lawsuits
[01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:25.640]  coming for them criminally suppressing the known therapeutics here it is what is this backpedaling
[01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:34.680]  from the fda really mean what it really means is that the fda has committed wrongdoing or
[01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:40.840]  malfeasance and this is now prima facie evidence of it you know in 2018 the fda had a very nice
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:47.080]  statement on his website saying why doctors should use drugs off their original advertising labels
[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:55.560]  and the reason is to fulfill an unmet need and in 2020 and 2021 clearly covet 19 wasn't unmet need
[01:13:55.560 --> 01:14:01.320]  there were no approved oral antivirals we were using hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin according
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:08.440]  to how we should do it by the fda guidance so when the fda came out and specifically said
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:13.640]  that doctors should not use ivermectin and specifically misled the public with a tweet
[01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:22.200]  that said that ivermectin is horse paced and and actually said quit using it the fda caused harm
[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:27.880]  doctors had found ivermectin to be useful in reducing the risk of hospitalization and death
[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:34.200]  and in particularly in the u.s study by um rocheter and colleagues called the icon study
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:39.720]  done in hospitalized patients ivermectin was associated with reduced mortality so the fda's
[01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:46.760]  actions led to unnecessary deaths and i think justice will have to come the fda now should be
[01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:52.280]  broadly sued uh you know it probably in a class action case against those who lost loved ones
[01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:59.800]  pre and pre hospital and during the hospital powerful now we come back the rest of the story
[01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:07.160]  we have dr krish shoemaker very very respected on the history of ivermectin and the fact that the
[01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:13.480]  pentagon a full five years before the release of covid-19 said specifically from their research
[01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:21.720]  in testing what would counter weaponized coronaviruses that ivermectin was essentially a miracle drug
[01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:30.920]  and that medical workers around any future deadly sars or covid situation should preemptively take
[01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:37.720]  cycles of it and that anyone who began to fill six and instantly go on it and it's totally safe the
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:45.800]  pentagon will show you documents and video specifically since the sars release over a decade
[01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:52.040]  ago studied all these different drugs and compounds on animals that the same effects as humans and

[01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:25.560]  the third round of those what a patriot that guy should run for president in fact it ought to be a
[01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:30.840]  senator paul senator ron johnson take it they knew they knew that i've been met tonight actually
[01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:36.200]  chlorican worked the pentagon tested both of them that's why all these scientists early on were saying
[01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:42.200]  take it it's why the japanese knocked the disease out in the africans why africa had the lowest
[01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:46.600]  death rate in the world and the lowest vaccination rate because they're not stupid they've been hit
[01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:52.840]  with bio weapons masquerading as vaccines before there's dr chris shoemaker laying out the real
[01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:57.400]  history of this of your tv viewer you can see the pentagon documents he's going to put on screen
[01:21:57.400 --> 01:22:02.920]  radio listeners can just search pentagon tested ivermectin found it was highly effective against
[01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:11.640]  the entire sars slash covid family of viruses here it is to realize is that north american science
[01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:19.080]  spent 15 years figuring out what to do with the next covet it was back 2002 2003 the original sars
[01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:26.280]  cov one occurred and so all sorts of experiments went on to determine what would be a useful response
[01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:34.040]  were something similar to occur and the research was done it was research was all done by 2015 2016
[01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:41.720]  and darpa darpa the american research arm of the us military it's specifically new and specifically
[01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:50.600]  recommended and passed the information on to the cdc that ivermectin in particular was the absolute
[01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:58.280]  number one product to be used in the event of a corona virus pandemic it was fully known that
[01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:06.440]  ivermectin and certainly hydroxychloroquine as well were highly antiviral and immune modulatory
[01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:13.000]  worry and those two things with the key to modulate the immune response plus to be antiviral as well
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:20.600]  those elements were both totally proven in vitro and in vivo with animals so that it was known and
[01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:25.080]  of course we knew it was completely safe for humans because these medications have been used for 35 to
[01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:32.440]  40 years in humans and so that's what was sitting there ready to be used at the next pandemic
[01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:39.240]  instead they demonized and attacked anybody including the scientists that tried to save people
[01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:48.440]  and we defeated this audience defeated tucker carlson defeated joe rogan defeated we defeated them to a
[01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:55.160]  great extent murdering tens of millions more by getting the hydroxychloroquine and of course the
[01:23:55.160 --> 01:24:00.760]  ivermectin out there and the pharmacist ignoring the feds telling them not to do it remember this
[01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:05.480]  fda says ivermectin doesn't work against cuba 19 but points to studies that show it does yeah they
[01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:09.720]  said oh it doesn't work in the headline and showed hundreds of studies on their site including by the
[01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:18.280]  fda saying it's a miracle drug so they can only put the false news up top that wasn't a study hoping
[01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:25.640]  you wouldn't read here's dr paul merrick very respected talking about them pushing randesivir
[01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:30.760]  that killed you more often had no antiviral properties but gave you a massive increase
[01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:37.400]  in renal failure in the kidneys here's that club in my hospital i was banned or discouraged from
[01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:45.560]  using off-label drugs which we use every day methylprednisolone vitamin c my hospital would
[01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:53.640]  not allow me to use vitamin c we're talking about basic safe drugs and it's an outrage what they
[01:24:53.640 --> 01:25:01.480]  wanted me to use was remdesivir where remdesivir we know and this is not controversial we know
[01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:09.800]  according to the who remdesivir increases your risk of kidney failure 20 fold remdesivir will
[01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:16.680]  increase your risk of developing renal failure 20 fold it increases your risk of dying by about
[01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:25.960]  4% it has no place in medicine yet the federal government will give hospitals a 20 bonus on
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:33.800]  the entire hospital bowl if you prescribe this toxic medication so you can see how the hospitals
[01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:40.040]  and the health care systems are now subservient to industry rather than doing what's best for
[01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:44.840]  their petitions and it was the same program worldwide of controlling doctors all run by the
[01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:50.920]  world economic forum and the un who'd had the policies written by them by big pharma this was
[01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:56.440]  a planned attack to suppress real treatments and give you weapons systems that would kill you and
[01:25:56.440 --> 01:26:01.480]  your family by the way thomas rand's two years ago trying to working with a whistleblower who was
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:07.480]  the vice president of ego health alliance dr. huff and when he first came out with a whistleblower
[01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:12.760]  doctor people said there's no way it can't be real of course it all was real and he is such
[01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:20.760]  an amazing hero here he is at senator johnson's hearings talking about the situation the transparency
[01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:25.800]  is the key to this whole thing whether that transparency can be put into bills and into
[01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:31.400]  various things in which you always need to do this is my recommendation for a solution you need
[01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:36.280]  to and you do have the power to do this because politically how do you oppose transparency
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:42.680]  how do you oppose outcome based funding for hospitals when those numbers are reported so we
[01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:50.920]  have cms data that showed in texas 90 of the people put on ventilators died 90 you have a
[01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:58.760]  better chance with russian roulette literally okay protocol that's a protocol so listen and not only
[01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:04.680]  is it a protocol but they get paid to do it a lot when you get go to the hospital you get
[01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:11.000]  tested they get paid more when you get admitted for covid they get paid more when they put you
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:15.560]  on remdesivir they get paid more when you get ventilated they get paid more when you die they
[01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:21.400]  get paid more this is perverse we have incentivized the murder of patients rather than incentivized
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:28.680]  treatment it's really easy we just put that out in the public and say hey public this election
[01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:33.640]  season do you want us to incentivize hospitals to uh have good outcomes or do you want us to
[01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:38.280]  continue incentivizing the murder of your loved ones i don't know that's right we make this a
[01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:43.320]  political issue instead of the racism football oh we're all racist we're all killing each other
[01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:48.840]  but really the globals are killing all of us and just remember all along the democrat politicians
[01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:55.400]  particularly we're quietly getting hydroxychloroquine and i've remitted for themselves while suppressing
[01:27:55.400 --> 01:28:01.160]  it to you and battling to make sure the public couldn't get it what a group of monsters who
[01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:09.960]  literally want to kill their constituents these people are beyond evil but you've got the mayor
[01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:16.360]  of new york at the time saying oh i got fries i got a burger take the shot you'll be totally protected
[01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:25.800]  remember that and the people that took the shot saying my medicine won't work unless you take yours
[01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:31.880]  and the kids in bubbles at band practice never were else in the whole cult and people wearing
[01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:38.360]  masks inside the water and inside their houses by themselves and now we're not supposed to
[01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:44.200]  criticize fouchy and bill gate says he's wargaming a new more deadly pandemic that hits children
[01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:50.840]  all seeing if we'll go along with the death cult and let them kill us while we praise them as our

[01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:23.960]  dangerous drugs possible it made any resistance to it possible was people continuing to support

[01:31:54.520 --> 01:32:00.200]  info wars alive because in the process you're keeping american liberty alive in arizona i think
[01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:08.280]  we watched the election be uh stolen slowly stolen day by day counting these mail-in ballots and it's
[01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:15.800]  absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously when we we just it's election month alex
[01:32:15.800 --> 01:32:22.920]  it's not election day and that's the problem and everything changed after covid-19 they illegally
[01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:29.720]  changed state elections uh mailing ballots to anyone and everyone and sometimes mailing multiple
[01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:34.920]  ballots to people well this isn't any way to run an election we're in a serious country when we have
[01:32:34.920 --> 01:32:39.880]  elections that can be stolen like this and i believe that just like i believe the election
[01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:45.720]  was stolen in 2020 and i have no problem saying that and it's it is so absurd for the media and
[01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:51.880]  the democrats to attack us that that question our election integrity and question the the fact that
[01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:58.040]  elections um shouldn't be run the way they are we're not election deniers we're election realists
[01:32:58.040 --> 01:33:06.040]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:20.440]  i've got a tiger by the tail explained to see i won't be much when you get through with me

[01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:42.920]  any and all wrongdoing and for the respect of covet nineteen vaccines we anticipate we will
[01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:47.960]  get approval for that governor sanis stated at a roundtable conference and medical professionals
[01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:54.440]  and vaccine injured citizens we've reached critical mass and i can tell you i'm going to
[01:35:54.440 --> 01:36:00.440]  leave it at this i've talked to some household names that have been at mainline top republican
[01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:06.920]  conferences one of which happened about a month ago with a hundred plus republican leaders
[01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:13.000]  from congress senators and house members and in the private meeting
[01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:20.440]  they basically agreed that we're under bio weapon attack that it is a new world order attack and
[01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:34.360]  that quote alex jones is right new world order you're in some deep crap and i alluded to that a
[01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:39.400]  few weeks ago but now i'm telling a little bit more you guys have screwed the pooch you're up the

[01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:49.560]  um it's funny you say that one of the big theories up here in canada is that he's actually
[01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:55.800]  fidel castrell's son if you look at pictures of trudeau next to castrell they look identical
[01:41:55.800 --> 01:42:00.120]  their parents used to go to cube all the time uh no i see that all the time but you know his dad
[01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:05.800]  was a pro-communist just as bad as fidel so apples don't fall too far from the tree but here's the
[01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:11.560]  thing if they can do us do it to us here in canada they're coming for you guys their government's
[01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:16.040]  going to come for every gun you own the government's going to come for everything until you're a good
[01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:22.760]  little servant and without people like you mr jones we won't win this fight but i truly believe
[01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:27.480]  that when people open their eyes and start listening to the truth listening to things that
[01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:34.600]  you have to say and oan and other people you know you're exposing them but the the truth in front

[01:47:15.400 --> 01:47:22.280]  calls here on the alex jones show rad in pennsylvania you're on the air alex thanks thanks for taking
[01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:28.120]  my call great show today as usual you're on fire you're the tip of spear man love you love you
[01:47:29.160 --> 01:47:34.840]  hey just santa is the real deal there's no question about it everything he does is quietly
[01:47:34.840 --> 01:47:42.200]  just quietly keeps moving forward with promoting uh liberty and freedom i'll say it i find no fault
[01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:47.800]  with this man he just is incredible now in paneling a statewide grand jury to prosecute the drug makers
[01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:55.640]  yeah yeah i mean when we know back to your point on fouchy he's guilty as sin for three years they
[01:47:55.640 --> 01:48:01.400]  try to defend him because he's deep state but he is he is done he's cooked and more in history he's
[01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:07.560]  gonna provide that proof there's no there's no question about it but uh the sanis is definitely
[01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:12.040]  ten times better than trump and i know you look you stood by stood by trump as long as you could
[01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:17.640]  and still do in some ways but he never defended himself he never got on and told us came out and
[01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:23.000]  said what what happened january 6 what happened at the end of his presidency he didn't explain
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:27.960]  anything which makes me believe that he's either part of the problem he doesn't get it or he's not
[01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:33.400]  telling the truth well here's the key to it all here's the key to it all brad in my view it's okay
[01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:38.680]  for trump to be stampeded into this to open the economy they lied to him it's okay that the sanis
[01:48:38.680 --> 01:48:43.240]  got stampeded you've got to come out when the evidence is there and say it's wrong like ran paul
[01:48:43.240 --> 01:48:49.160]  got stampeded at first but he came out and said he was wrong and they're bad to not do that makes
[01:48:49.160 --> 01:48:53.560]  you deep state i'm not saying trump is deep state i still care about trump but he's so pigheaded but
[01:48:53.560 --> 01:48:59.320]  now i warned trump this is all going to be blamed on you and now you have the head of the cdc another
[01:48:59.320 --> 01:49:04.040]  saying yeah we lied to you yeah we knew the shot wouldn't work well they lied to trump he should be
[01:49:04.040 --> 01:49:08.360]  burning them while there's still time because that's what matters if trump comes out against the shot
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:14.040]  we'll go over the top and we'll get falchi and dazik and and bill gates arrested but it's going
[01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:19.160]  to happen regardless now you can see the momentum i can tell you from folks that have had meetings
[01:49:19.160 --> 01:49:24.760]  with again over a hundred members of congress that they are now basically awake okay so there's no
[01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:29.160]  put the genie back in the bottle brad thanks all right let's talk to daniel in arizona biblical
[01:49:29.160 --> 01:49:39.720]  view on things go ahead daniel well yes go ahead so um glacians board 21 through 31 says that the
[01:49:39.720 --> 01:49:45.720]  jewish uh unbelieving jews not the believing jews but the unbelieving jews are our persecutors
[01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:51.560]  and this actually explains a lot of what you see in the world how they want to destroy the west
[01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:57.400]  because to them they think the west is christianity and um do you want me to put you on hold for when
[01:49:57.400 --> 01:50:00.680]  nick feintes is on because i'm sure he wants to go where you're going that way you can have
[01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:06.600]  more time or you want to finish up now i mean yeah it's fine to go on with nick feintes we'll
[01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:14.120]  put you on hold we'll take call someone nicks on so stay there don't hang up okay up next is
[01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:19.880]  james from indiana go ahead james hey there's news out of montana of a veckham parking lot
[01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:24.760]  suicide that just faded in the wind these are institutional failures as grievances are ignored
[01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:29.160]  the ig is about worthless they put out all types of reports of government failure as nothing changes
[01:50:29.160 --> 01:50:32.280]  that allows the government to break federal prescribing laws drug veterans with pills that
[01:50:32.280 --> 01:50:37.400]  cause all types of problems to include suicide then manufacture cases against them the just right
[01:50:37.400 --> 01:50:43.320]  the pentagon gives them a whole bunch of so-called antidepressants that on the label say massively
[01:50:43.320 --> 01:50:49.880]  increased suicide and violent tendencies absolutely the justice department's corrupt has no credibility
[01:50:49.880 --> 01:50:53.320]  but revealed itself to an agency that should be dissolved we have political prisoners in this
[01:50:53.320 --> 01:50:57.160]  country while the merchant of death walks free it's not about justice but destroying anyone
[01:50:57.160 --> 01:51:00.920]  that is targeted at all costs while government corruption gets a free pass the government has
[01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:07.000]  no will to help anyone and is out to destroy everyone well said sir god bless you let's go

[01:53:18.120 --> 01:53:22.280]  into your few of what your other callers were saying about the census hey the census has
[01:53:22.280 --> 01:53:29.080]  acknowledged the world economic forum and so has also gathered if trump would take 30 seconds and
[01:53:29.080 --> 01:53:34.760]  take those uh you will know a horari clips and the claus Schwab clips and make his first post
[01:53:34.760 --> 01:53:39.720]  on twitter this is what you're up against and i'm here to defend you against this the great reset
[01:53:39.720 --> 01:53:45.480]  the new world order that the globalist that want you dead if he does if he can't say that we have
[01:53:45.480 --> 01:53:49.480]  no more use for him well let me tell you what i did you saw six months ago whatever it was when i
[01:53:49.480 --> 01:53:54.440]  gave trump the ultimatum i shot two videos because roger stone said he's hearing you he wants to know
[01:53:54.440 --> 01:53:59.400]  why you're criticizing you i got a call from trump i missed a call i got another call a few days
[01:53:59.400 --> 01:54:03.960]  later missed a call you gotta sit there and wait for the call and i just can't do that and he calls
[01:54:03.960 --> 01:54:11.560]  late at night and stuff too so roger and others sat down and showed trump the clips and i also know
[01:54:11.560 --> 01:54:15.400]  somebody else that works for trump sets i get a hold of him if i want to uh that works in his
[01:54:15.400 --> 01:54:19.800]  opposite margo very close to him i'll leave it at that and trump just said i don't want to see that
[01:54:19.800 --> 01:54:23.480]  anymore i don't want to hear about it and so if alex wants to bring that up i don't want to hear
[01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:28.920]  about it from him so i've already tried and in those videos i'd show all that i document how
[01:54:28.920 --> 01:54:34.760]  they set him up and he just doesn't want to hear it so i've tried well i i i understand that but
[01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:41.080]  roger also and i love roger i love the man i've met him several times i i'm i'm so i'm
[01:54:41.080 --> 01:54:45.560]  disgusted about what he went through but he lied about ronda sanchez on your show
[01:54:45.560 --> 01:54:50.040]  saying that he was in skull and bone no i i checked that out he ronda sanchez was not in
[01:54:50.040 --> 01:54:54.600]  skull and bones he was in the pilgrim society all right i appreciate your call all right let's go
[01:54:54.600 --> 01:54:59.000]  ahead and take another call let's talk to will in alabama will you're on the air go ahead
[01:55:00.840 --> 01:55:06.680]  hey alex uh i just want to say big supporter uh you know i'd follow you to the gates of hell brother
[01:55:06.680 --> 01:55:13.480]  um i just want to talk about the uh what i call the rise of the ai anti christ
[01:55:14.200 --> 01:55:21.640]  and uh the current like normalization that the transhumanist media is giving it with shows like
[01:55:21.640 --> 01:55:27.320]  westworld i'm not sure if you've seen that the last season just came out i've seen a few episodes
[01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:34.520]  of the earlier seasons yeah so they didn't bring in this type of stuff until like the later seasons
[01:55:34.520 --> 01:55:40.040]  and what where it gets weird is so like uh back kind of back in the day when you know you had to
[01:55:40.040 --> 01:55:45.480]  hit some heroic doses of dnt and stuff i feel like i was kind of given some visions of the
[01:55:45.480 --> 01:55:51.400]  armageddon and the antichrist i kind of became aware of saying plans to manifest himself into our
[01:55:51.400 --> 01:55:56.600]  plane via artificial intelligence you know all civilizations eventually ending humans attempting
[01:55:56.600 --> 01:56:02.840]  to summon bail into our plane or satan again um and this time i just got the vision that would be
[01:56:02.840 --> 01:56:07.240]  through creating a near omniscient omnipotent machine that would use the collective processing
[01:56:07.240 --> 01:56:12.120]  power of every device on the planet like a network of neurons monitor every decision
[01:56:12.120 --> 01:56:17.080]  and action humans make with devices with the devices and it steals our art our culture our
[01:56:17.080 --> 01:56:21.800]  literature our ideas and then says that it's giving it to us it's like stoplights are the most
[01:56:21.800 --> 01:56:26.840]  powerful form of ai currently because we interface with it and follow its orders it's very primitive
[01:56:26.840 --> 01:56:31.720]  but we give it power by following its directives we do it because it makes sense collectively we
[01:56:31.720 --> 01:56:37.960]  decide to do it but ai is only as powerful as we make it thank you so much for the call all right
[01:56:37.960 --> 01:56:42.520]  we'll take a few more calls in the short next segment then we're going to bring in nick pointes
[01:56:42.520 --> 01:56:47.960]  for the next two hours and uh have a discussion i mean you can call it a debate if you want but
[01:56:47.960 --> 01:56:52.200]  just a discussion about what happened a week and a half ago with yay kanya west here in studio
[01:56:52.760 --> 01:56:57.400]  and just all the stuff that went on and you know i made jokes about nick and and and stuff
[01:56:57.400 --> 01:57:04.360]  and he you know he he he made jokes as well but i really on a racist rick or scale i seen him as
[01:57:04.360 --> 01:57:09.640]  about a one and i and i disagree with some of the things he says but the adl's an 11 on a scale of
[01:57:09.640 --> 01:57:15.080]  1 to 10 i mean their next level and they are running the censorship of the control so i don't
[01:57:15.080 --> 01:57:20.120]  deny that's going on those are terrible groups my issue is just because the adl and the leftist
[01:57:20.120 --> 01:57:25.240]  hollywood hates this is not to get us doesn't mean hitler was good uh and and so i'm not going to make
[01:57:25.240 --> 01:57:30.360]  the whole debate about about hitler but uh it just gives me a headache because i've never liked hitler
[01:57:30.920 --> 01:57:35.560]  and i didn't get a call from the adl to say you better say you hate hitler i really don't agree
[01:57:35.560 --> 01:57:41.240]  with the fortarianism whether it's stallin mal hitler gg ping i mean any of it but that's all

[02:01:06.200 --> 02:01:12.760]  jones is playing a character and is a performance artist jones is playing a character on his radio
[02:01:12.760 --> 02:01:20.200]  show the radio rants of alex jones are just an act he's actually a performance artist he's a

[02:01:27.720 --> 02:01:33.400]  and it's all based on custody battle max wife five years ago and she was trying to put into
[02:01:33.400 --> 02:01:38.760]  evidence me dressed up more than a decade before like the joker being sarcastic saying take your

[02:01:45.960 --> 02:01:50.440]  wanted to enter that in evidence they look he's insane telling kids to use drugs and my lawyer
[02:01:50.440 --> 02:01:56.040]  went when jack nicholson plays the part of the joker no one thinks that's really jack nicholson
[02:01:56.040 --> 02:02:04.280]  so yeah when i've been cobra commander or optimus prime auto bonds let's roll or the joker because

[02:02:29.800 --> 02:02:35.640]  on b it's not trying to lie to you it's being sarcastic by the vaccinate me on modol today
[02:02:35.640 --> 02:02:41.560]  it's required by the cbc if they play those games and that's why i don't joke around as much as i
[02:02:41.560 --> 02:02:47.480]  used to even though i tell people okay this is a joke this isn't serious they clip it out and they
[02:02:47.480 --> 02:02:54.440]  say no this is what he really believes every day when i leave work i do this that man's threatened

[02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:24.840]  alex jones
[02:06:28.840 --> 02:06:33.320]  jonah will be fine they don't have the courage of their convictions and it makes them
[02:06:33.320 --> 02:06:39.080]  a tough adversary because it's like fighting a ghost like we are solid in what we believe we
[02:06:39.080 --> 02:06:44.280]  believe in the family we believe in western culture we believe in jesus christ that's
[02:06:44.920 --> 02:06:50.200]  that's stalwart that's set in stone they're just moving all over the place whatever it takes to win
[02:06:50.200 --> 02:06:58.040]  cheating on elections supporting nazis whatever works they do it how do you fight them do you
[02:06:58.040 --> 02:07:04.120]  recognize who they are everything they say is a lie yeah and and every time they're confronted
[02:07:04.120 --> 02:07:12.760]  with that lie they there is a kind of energy in there almost sacred energy in the swastika that it's
[02:07:12.760 --> 02:07:20.520]  so hated it's treated so negatively it's like the the center of the liberal morality is don't be
[02:07:20.520 --> 02:07:26.920]  hitler so it's there's so much like invested in it that it weirdly becomes sacred and becomes
[02:07:26.920 --> 02:07:34.120]  powerful and so when khanye tapped into that now what it what is exactly does khanye know about
[02:07:34.120 --> 02:07:39.720]  hitler is he an actual fascist i don't think so is you know whatever he's tapping in to some kind
[02:07:39.720 --> 02:07:45.720]  of dark energy that's very powerful and maybe maybe destructive and chaotic as well but it's
[02:07:45.720 --> 02:07:51.640]  powerful nevertheless and he was willing to do that in a way that ultimately alex jones isn't alex
[02:07:51.640 --> 02:07:57.160]  jones belongs in the brun paul era you know where it's like we believe in free speech and our
[02:07:57.160 --> 02:08:03.400]  constitution and we hate the nazis the liberals are the real nazis or whatever that in some ways
[02:08:03.400 --> 02:08:10.040]  even as wild as alex jones can be he's ultimately still trapped in that moral cage of the liberals
[02:08:10.040 --> 02:08:18.600]  he despises he agrees with them on the their most fundamental issue khanye was like going to the dark
[02:08:18.600 --> 02:08:26.920]  magic he was going there he was tapping into that energy a place where alex jones dares not tread
[02:08:26.920 --> 02:08:34.840]  so i i just think that in itself is really remarkable and is demonstrating something
[02:08:34.840 --> 02:08:39.880]  it's revealing something about the world i i think it is kind of taking us to a new place
[02:08:40.520 --> 02:08:46.440]  in a way and you can complain about it i mean of course the adl complains about a one one one
[02:08:46.440 --> 02:08:54.360]  one but like what can you say about it i mean there he's yeah he probably does have some serious
[02:08:55.000 --> 02:09:00.760]  you know mental struggles he has some personal struggles so do i but you know he's authentic
[02:09:00.760 --> 02:09:06.600]  he's speaking his truth he's being real he's actually having the conversation that people want
[02:09:09.320 --> 02:09:15.640]  so yay he's like the joker and he's been saying you know i'm like a superhero i'm like doing
[02:09:15.640 --> 02:09:19.720]  something heroic blah blah but he said the other day in the office he's like but i feel more like
[02:09:22.040 --> 02:09:27.320]  and i was dying at that but it's true you know because like your alex jones and your margie
[02:09:27.320 --> 02:09:32.440]  telegreen they're they're like the other criminals and got them in dark night they're like the mob bosses
[02:09:33.160 --> 02:09:39.000]  and they bring in they bring in joker to kill the bad man you know they bring in yay for the publicity
[02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:42.680]  they bring them in to take care of a problem which is you know they want to get traffic or
[02:09:42.680 --> 02:09:47.400]  that they're you know whatever it is on their website and so it's just like how the criminals
[02:09:47.400 --> 02:09:52.920]  bring in the joker and joker burns all the money and says all you care about is money is this
[02:09:52.920 --> 02:09:57.560]  talented there's a better class of criminals and they're all like horrified in life and they're
[02:09:57.560 --> 02:10:01.960]  criminals they kill people and they're murderers and they're like who is this it's the same thing
[02:10:01.960 --> 02:10:07.400]  it's like alex jones and marge they bring this guy in and yay is like all you people
[02:10:07.400 --> 02:10:17.480]  will care about is money it's not about money it's about sending a message everything burns
[02:10:18.120 --> 02:10:23.720]  and then it's people like me i'm like i'm like the hungry dog let's see how loyal i'm a hungry dog
[02:10:23.720 --> 02:10:30.840]  you know i'm and i'm and i'm bad you know try out you know he breaks the pool queue and throws it
[02:10:30.840 --> 02:10:36.120]  on the floor dropper fights to the death that's just who he is he's an artist he's a genius
[02:10:36.120 --> 02:10:41.320]  and above all that he's right
[02:10:46.440 --> 02:10:49.000]  so i thought i'd play a few of the clips i saw on the internet
[02:10:49.720 --> 02:10:54.760]  of kind of the other side burn it all down bring down the system you know claus wabba says he wants
[02:10:54.760 --> 02:11:01.000]  an angrier world they want to bring down the system and bring in a new system so i've never really
[02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:05.880]  been accused by anybody credible of being loyal opposition or getting a call from the adl and
[02:11:05.880 --> 02:11:09.240]  told what to say and i'm sure when nick you know and others have said that that's that's tongue
[02:11:09.240 --> 02:11:14.120]  in cheek no no i legitimately don't like gingis kahn i i don't like adolf hitler i don't like
[02:11:14.120 --> 02:11:18.840]  mousey tongue i don't like joseph stalin or the island and i don't like the adl and their incredible
[02:11:18.840 --> 02:11:23.320]  authoritarianism and i've been pushing really hard to stop them destroying our first amendment
[02:11:23.320 --> 02:11:28.680]  but you know you can dislike hitler and also dislike the adl in my worldview and i know it's the
[02:11:28.680 --> 02:11:34.680]  naughty naughty thing to appear and say you love hitler but i i don't agree with that i agree with
[02:11:34.680 --> 02:11:38.440]  people's first amendment i agree they shouldn't be penalized for it and that's why i created a
[02:11:38.440 --> 02:11:44.120]  platform for that one of the biggest things probably ever definitely the most views we've
[02:11:44.120 --> 02:11:48.920]  ever had for one event i mean in game got watched a hundred million times like 80 something million
[02:11:48.920 --> 02:11:53.240]  times on uh google video before they took it down but that you know that took a couple years to do
[02:11:53.240 --> 02:11:57.000]  before they took it down but but this is definitely one of the biggest things we've ever done but it
[02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:02.920]  just kind of to me was very interesting it was thought provoking and of course we see uh people
[02:12:02.920 --> 02:12:08.680]  like scott adams saying oh i see what yay did he's trying to overturn the whole chess board
[02:12:09.400 --> 02:12:14.280]  so is that really what went on so so before we have a debate or an argument uh i'd like to
[02:12:14.280 --> 02:12:18.200]  give nick some time to give his views we really haven't talked much other than briefly sunday about
[02:12:18.200 --> 02:12:23.640]  him coming on today about what he thinks really went on there because some people thought i staged
[02:12:23.640 --> 02:12:27.000]  that and i was in on it or something no i didn't know what's going on it's kind of like trump
[02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:32.600]  didn't know what was going on uh to a greater extent i knew i was meeting with and then i had seen clips
[02:12:32.600 --> 02:12:37.240]  of nick saying he didn't support hitler it actually wasn't anti-semitic he just didn't like what some
[02:12:37.240 --> 02:12:42.600]  of the jewish mafia is doing claiming everybody's the nazi doesn't agree with him so i just kind of
[02:12:42.600 --> 02:12:48.920]  saw this really as an enigma of what's really going on so uncensored unfiltered nick pointes
[02:12:48.920 --> 02:12:55.080]  joins us uh for the next hour and uh 42 minutes or so uh nick thanks for joining us what do you
[02:12:55.080 --> 02:12:59.640]  want to talk about first or will you humor me and tell me what the hell you think happened a week
[02:12:59.640 --> 02:13:05.800]  and a half ago here in the studio yes well hello alex great to be with you um i'll humor you and we
[02:13:05.800 --> 02:13:10.600]  could talk a little bit about how the show went down um for anybody that thinks it was staged of
[02:13:10.600 --> 02:13:17.640]  course it wasn't um and and people they have all these ideas about where this is coming from where
[02:13:17.640 --> 02:13:22.360]  yay is coming from with these new ideas and and with these kinds of things and people have talked
[02:13:22.360 --> 02:13:27.720]  about mental illness and they've said that people like me are giving him ideas or handling him
[02:13:27.720 --> 02:13:33.800]  people speculated that the walkout on tim pool or the show that we did with you was staged
[02:13:33.800 --> 02:13:38.760]  and i can assure you i've been working with yay for the last three weeks nothing is staged
[02:13:38.760 --> 02:13:45.880]  and nobody can handle him nobody can influence him he's his own man and as far as the uh mental
[02:13:45.880 --> 02:13:51.720]  illness remarks goes you know i've met manic people before i've known bipolar people he's
[02:13:51.720 --> 02:13:58.920]  not a bipolar or an unstable person in fact he's highly energetic vigorous works all day creative
[02:13:59.560 --> 02:14:04.760]  i really can't say enough positive things about him um but with regards to the appearance on your
[02:14:04.760 --> 02:14:11.800]  show what i've noticed is that yay has started this conversation with the death con three tweet
[02:14:11.800 --> 02:14:17.880]  about the jews he went on your show and he said that he loves hitler and what's i think the most
[02:14:17.880 --> 02:14:23.160]  remarkable about this is everybody is fixated on the remark what did you mean by death con three
[02:14:23.160 --> 02:14:27.400]  what did you mean by you love hitler what do you love about hitler what does death con mean is that
[02:14:27.400 --> 02:14:32.760]  a threat and so on and he's done several interviews he did an interview with pierce morgan with lex
[02:14:32.760 --> 02:14:39.800]  freedman with tim pool with you with gavin and in all the interviews it's so focused on the hitler
[02:14:39.800 --> 02:14:44.760]  it's focused on the jewish and for a lot of people they might say oh well of course that's an outrageous
[02:14:44.760 --> 02:14:49.880]  thing to say it's so provocative and maybe that was the intention maybe it was about publicity maybe
[02:14:49.880 --> 02:14:56.680]  it was staged but if you listen if you listen to what the man is saying he has said what got us
[02:14:56.680 --> 02:15:02.600]  to this point i think that it's almost it says something in itself that the conversation is
[02:15:02.600 --> 02:15:08.760]  about the remark rather than all the in my opinion far more outrageous things going on all around
[02:15:08.760 --> 02:15:14.760]  which is that right now the adl is shaking down congress for five hundred million dollars i don't
[02:15:14.760 --> 02:15:19.880]  know if people realize that submitted an appropriations request in response to the interview we did
[02:15:20.520 --> 02:15:24.440]  now you've got you know whether you thought it was entertaining whether you thought it was
[02:15:24.440 --> 02:15:30.360]  revolutionary you have yay with a mask on with a you who and a net saying i love hitler and the

[02:19:19.880 --> 02:19:24.440]  on their 28 years and i knew they were planning all of this and i warned the public as a modern

[02:20:24.840 --> 02:20:33.400]  you know i guess what i want to say here is alex jones and this thing my broadcast is i really
[02:20:33.400 --> 02:20:38.760]  didn't know that yay was going to come here and do that i didn't know that nick pointes was going
[02:20:38.760 --> 02:20:43.720]  to agree with him i understand their first amendment i understand when the adl on the left
[02:20:43.720 --> 02:20:49.400]  says it's inherently racist and able to be white or to be christian that they've crossed that rubicon
[02:20:49.400 --> 02:20:57.480]  and basically become what they say hitler was so at that point you know yay isn't taking people's
[02:20:57.480 --> 02:21:02.520]  mega council way and spying on folks on twitter and facebook and instagram and i'm wanting 500
[02:21:02.520 --> 02:21:07.800]  million dollars from congress for this hate task force to basically silence anybody that
[02:21:07.800 --> 02:21:13.400]  criticizes uh any of the leftist operations so i don't like any of that i'm a big enemy of it
[02:21:13.400 --> 02:21:19.240]  the the adl singles me out at their big events and wants me destroyed my only frustration is
[02:21:19.240 --> 02:21:24.520]  i legitimately nick have studied world war two and also had family that was in world war two
[02:21:25.080 --> 02:21:31.320]  and know that a bunch of the top nazis tried to kill hitler like erwin rommel and people and uh
[02:21:31.320 --> 02:21:36.600]  that stalin admired hitler and and and you know all the rest of this i don't like stalin either
[02:21:36.600 --> 02:21:43.960]  and so just because what was done to germans was wrong in world war one and and and there were also
[02:21:43.960 --> 02:21:49.080]  war crimes against germans in my view just let's just get the hitler thing out of the way do you
[02:21:49.080 --> 02:21:57.640]  actually admire adolf hitler in some ways yes and i'm not a national socialist and i'm not uh you
[02:21:57.640 --> 02:22:02.680]  know i wouldn't identify that way because i'm a i'm a christian so i'm not any kind of a socialist
[02:22:02.680 --> 02:22:08.120]  or a fascist i i like yay believe we should have a christian government it's christian country god
[02:22:08.120 --> 02:22:13.000]  runs the world we should have a government in accordance with that but but honestly i i don't
[02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:19.880]  share this uh history on a jewish view that hitler is this exceptionally bogeyman evil figure
[02:22:20.520 --> 02:22:26.840]  the 20th century is full of of violence the 20th century is full of authoritarian ideologies run
[02:22:26.840 --> 02:22:32.440]  rampant and and that's a product of modernism and liberalism and all kinds of trends um but but this
[02:22:32.440 --> 02:22:39.720]  idea that that my life is in any way impacted by hitler i have a lot more animosity for the adl
[02:22:39.720 --> 02:22:44.200]  i have a lot more animosity for the zoe i have a lot more animosity for the groups that have
[02:22:44.200 --> 02:22:49.400]  actually made my life and the life of my family materially worse personally and across the board
[02:22:49.400 --> 02:22:56.040]  with the society uh i'm i'm sick of being expected by jewish media and holocaust museums to to beat
[02:22:56.040 --> 02:23:01.560]  my chest like you kind of did the other week is all i hate hitler i hitler's you know it's it's
[02:23:01.560 --> 02:23:06.440]  like this weird it's like 1984 you know when they put the face on the tv and everybody's got to get
[02:23:06.440 --> 02:23:11.800]  all wound up uh he's he's not talking about 10 minutes you're talking about 10 minutes of hate
[02:23:11.800 --> 02:23:19.480]  well i legitimately hate stahl and hate mal hate hitler hate the adl hate barack obama
[02:23:19.480 --> 02:23:24.120]  hate the democratic party and and i've always remember me on pierce morgan i didn't get a call
[02:23:24.120 --> 02:23:28.280]  from the adl when i was on pierce morgan the most popular thing he ever did the biggest thing
[02:23:28.280 --> 02:23:33.080]  scenic did that year they had a the the ratings they're like 50 million viewers for that their
[02:23:33.080 --> 02:23:37.800]  average show had like 10 million back then and i said hitler took the guns stalin took the guns
[02:23:37.800 --> 02:23:44.200]  mal took the guns and if you try to take our guns 1776 will commence again i've always criticized
[02:23:44.200 --> 02:23:49.480]  hitler i've made documentaries about the bush family helping fund hitler and and the british
[02:23:49.480 --> 02:23:56.040]  royalty so where we have a sticking point is is that alex got the call as you as you sit on
[02:23:56.040 --> 02:24:01.000]  social media and i'm just curious do you think i actually got a call to come out and criticize
[02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:06.680]  hitler you think that's a new thing for me no no i know that you're very uh vocally anti hitler
[02:24:06.680 --> 02:24:11.240]  over the years i know that you're more of a libertarian and so you have this view of history
[02:24:11.240 --> 02:24:17.640]  which which lumps in together mal stalin hitler as authoritarians versus uh freedom fighters
[02:24:17.640 --> 02:24:22.360]  capitalist you know george george uh washington hommis jefferson's i'm familiar with your show
[02:24:22.360 --> 02:24:27.160]  and all of that and and honestly it was a little bit glib you called me baby hitler i said you got
[02:24:27.160 --> 02:24:32.680]  a call you know quite honestly it's banter but it is well known that you don't really talk about
[02:24:32.680 --> 02:24:38.600]  this issue you're you're more talking about new world order bill gates and and these sort of obscure
[02:24:38.600 --> 02:24:43.080]  conspiracy theories like bill derbergh my show is a lot more focused on you know what you might
[02:24:43.080 --> 02:24:48.280]  call the jewish question which is what are we to do about this jewish elite these jewish gangsters
[02:24:48.280 --> 02:24:52.600]  that run our christian country these and i think and i think that's a debate that should be had
[02:24:52.600 --> 02:24:58.280]  because there's no doubt that leftism and the whole globalist power grab has wrapped itself in
[02:24:58.280 --> 02:25:05.320]  judyism as its defense and i would call the ftx folks and the federal regulators who all uh you
[02:25:05.320 --> 02:25:10.040]  know involved in this basically are jewish uh who are out there doing that are criminals who happen
[02:25:10.040 --> 02:25:14.840]  to be jewish who are hiding behind judyism but i don't then blame the average jew for that so i
[02:25:14.840 --> 02:25:19.400]  think that's the difference kind of like when ye and you were on uh with the gavin mcginnis and and
[02:25:19.400 --> 02:25:24.200]  he's like well you know blacks commit as proportionate more crime than the other group but you don't
[02:25:24.200 --> 02:25:28.040]  just blame the average black person do you just not trusted jew when they come in the room and
[02:25:28.040 --> 02:25:33.640]  ye goes yeah i just i don't i don't you know to me that that's what i'm saying is i do believe in
[02:25:33.640 --> 02:25:40.120]  martin wither king that we judge individuals by who they are uh and what they do not by what color
[02:25:40.120 --> 02:25:46.760]  they are where they're from but go ahead i agree with that in principle but we also have to understand
[02:25:46.760 --> 02:25:50.680]  that it's it's not that these people happen to be jewish i think that's the big source of the
[02:25:50.680 --> 02:25:56.680]  disagreement is these are what we're told in in the last few weeks uh when ye makes these remarks
[02:25:56.680 --> 02:26:01.320]  about the jewish media or jewish hollywood or so on as well these are individuals these are people
[02:26:01.320 --> 02:26:05.800]  that we've got to name them individually and these are people that happen to be bad or rather they
[02:26:05.800 --> 02:26:11.800]  are bad and happen to be jewish but i think there's something about their jewishness that that makes
[02:26:11.800 --> 02:26:17.320]  it this way and i think that that is really the source of the disagreement my morality is not bound
[02:26:17.320 --> 02:26:22.840]  up in in this authoritarian versus freedom thing it's about god versus the devil and the curious
[02:26:22.840 --> 02:26:27.480]  fact about the jewish religion which all all the jewish people that came to america in the last
[02:26:27.480 --> 02:26:33.800]  century as immigrants were religious when the people came over at at ls island in the late
[02:26:33.800 --> 02:26:37.800]  uh 19th and early 20th century they came from these rabbinical communities they were all very
[02:26:37.800 --> 02:26:42.920]  religious and so you've got all the jews in america elite not elite they're one two or three
[02:26:42.920 --> 02:26:48.760]  generations removed from these very religious rabbinical jewish communities what's curious
[02:26:48.760 --> 02:26:54.600]  about the jewish religion is it's the only one that has an extreme antipathy for jesus christ
[02:26:54.600 --> 02:27:01.080]  muslims revere jesus as a prophet buddhas hindus they review jesus as as a wise teacher we all
[02:27:01.080 --> 02:27:07.400]  agree that jesus existed it's only the jews that say that jesus is burning in hell boiling in semen
[02:27:07.400 --> 02:27:11.720]  and extra men and say that his mother is a whore and so you take these people that come from europe
[02:27:12.360 --> 02:27:16.200]  and and again it's their children grandchildren great-grandchildren who are now in charge of
[02:27:16.200 --> 02:27:21.160]  the elite institutions well sure i mean nicole say this even kline came out on his huge podcast
[02:27:21.160 --> 02:27:25.800]  and said i would murder jesus again jews should you know basically kill christians and you didn't
[02:27:25.800 --> 02:27:31.080]  say kill jews so he went further than you and yay and no one decried it and that is wrong he said
[02:27:31.080 --> 02:27:35.400]  i'm jewish i want to kill jesus again we should kill jesus we should basically kill christians
[02:27:35.400 --> 02:27:39.480]  and when he did when he said it was like cute and funny and the media loved it you didn't call for
[02:27:39.480 --> 02:27:44.520]  violence in the city body so on a scale of me disagreeing with you you're a one and kline
[02:27:44.520 --> 02:27:49.800]  and the adl are a ten i look i'm not friends with the adl i get what you're saying i'm just saying
[02:27:49.800 --> 02:27:54.840]  that any authoritarian movement i think is extremely dangerous and we're not faced with hitler today
[02:27:55.400 --> 02:27:59.720]  we're faced with the adl and other authoritarian movements so i think coming out and invoking hitler
[02:27:59.720 --> 02:28:03.960]  almost gives those groups cover and now as you said they're trying to get 500 million dollars from
[02:28:03.960 --> 02:28:09.560]  congress yeah i understand where you're coming from i i think maybe that's more of a tactical
[02:28:09.560 --> 02:28:14.360]  disagreement and i and i told you uh over the weekend maybe this is my youth you know i'm
[02:28:14.360 --> 02:28:19.320]  willing to humble myself and say i'm young and zealous and idealistic as everybody
[02:28:19.320 --> 02:28:24.280]  can relate to that uh but i do think i might be honest something here which is that we've watched
[02:28:24.280 --> 02:28:29.800]  for 20 30 years and things just keep getting worse and and we saw what happened in 2020
[02:28:29.800 --> 02:28:35.000]  the election was stolen the whole first term was rigged and trump comes back even weaker than before
[02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:40.200]  and i'm like when are we gonna confront head on the fundamental problems when are we gonna head
[02:28:40.200 --> 02:28:43.720]  on stay there we'll talk about what you think the fundamental problems are when we come back
[02:28:43.720 --> 02:28:47.720]  and then i'll give you my response to that and more nick pointe as is our guest we're having a

[02:31:55.560 --> 02:32:03.960]  air infowarstore.com so when i first started taking survival shield basically i was 275 pounds i was
[02:32:03.960 --> 02:32:09.080]  overweight i had brain fog like you wouldn't believe i was barely holding on to a job and i
[02:32:09.080 --> 02:32:13.560]  heard dr group on your show and i listened to it so the first one i got was the original survival
[02:32:13.560 --> 02:32:18.120]  shield the x1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out with that you
[02:32:18.120 --> 02:32:22.040]  had you know with a deep burn source you know and i got really excited about that so i took it and
[02:32:22.040 --> 02:32:28.520]  man in two weeks i went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened you know
[02:32:28.520 --> 02:32:33.800]  i could think again i could connect with people again and over the course of the next couple of
[02:32:33.800 --> 02:32:38.680]  years i got my health back and i religiously take basically all of your supplements they're all
[02:32:38.680 --> 02:32:43.160]  absolutely amazing supplements the one i like recently is knockout it literally like if you
[02:32:43.160 --> 02:32:47.880]  want to sleep just take it it's amazing it works but anyway so the point is we have to get ourselves
[02:32:47.880 --> 02:32:52.360]  clean we have to break free of the globalist system and the only way to do that is to take
[02:32:52.360 --> 02:32:57.560]  our own health into our own hand beautifully said brother i thank you so much for calling godspeed
[02:32:57.560 --> 02:33:15.960]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[02:33:15.960 --> 02:33:27.400]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[02:33:29.880 --> 02:33:34.600]  all right remember we're still on over 400 radio stations so we have 14 minutes of ads an hour of
[02:33:34.600 --> 02:33:39.400]  the industry standard though i do enjoy doing a lot of the commercial free podcast you find it
[02:33:39.400 --> 02:33:44.440]  banned out video as well we did a three hour one commercial free this last saturday with a major
[02:33:44.440 --> 02:33:49.000]  whistleblower from the wuhan lab the vice president of ego of the alliance proving
[02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:53.160]  about she created the bio weapon and released it and more so incredibly important while the
[02:33:53.160 --> 02:34:00.600]  system wants us shut down now nick foyntes is here with us and he said going after bill gates
[02:34:01.800 --> 02:34:08.600]  and the bill de berg group is kind of this esoteric little known thing but he's going up against
[02:34:08.600 --> 02:34:17.160]  the jews well i mean folks in case you've woken up and looked around the entire wef is calling the
[02:34:17.160 --> 02:34:21.720]  shots the big mega banks are running the show they're coming after our bodies are trying new
[02:34:21.720 --> 02:34:27.560]  lockdowns new force injections that is not some esoteric little side issue that we're covering
[02:34:27.560 --> 02:34:32.440]  in fact no one was really covering it until we started hammering it the last 28 years so i'm
[02:34:32.440 --> 02:34:38.360]  very proud of that that's what my films and books like the great reset in the war for the world are
[02:34:38.360 --> 02:34:43.640]  about now i'm not saying nick foyntes doesn't have a right to say what he's saying or bring up what
[02:34:43.640 --> 02:34:49.160]  he's saying because separately the adl is brainwashing school children on record that being white
[02:34:49.160 --> 02:34:53.960]  is inherently bad and teaching kindergartners and first graders they are bad because they're white
[02:34:53.960 --> 02:35:00.520]  well i mean hitler taught people people were bad because of what group they were so i i'm like i see
[02:35:00.520 --> 02:35:05.400]  the adl as hitler and then people that are supposedly opposing and say well hitler you know
[02:35:05.400 --> 02:35:10.680]  uh compared to them is good that's where i have the real breaking point and so i asked the question
[02:35:10.680 --> 02:35:14.600]  earlier i want you to go to get back into your point about the power structure and what you're
[02:35:14.600 --> 02:35:17.960]  doing you'll have the floor for a few minutes i'll shut up but what about what i asked earlier that
[02:35:17.960 --> 02:35:23.240]  i forgot to get back to the adl wants 500 million they want more control over society because of
[02:35:23.880 --> 02:35:29.320]  kanya west yay's little comments here i get he's obviously not a threat he doesn't control people's
[02:35:29.320 --> 02:35:36.600]  bank accounts that's a joke but then people say is yay really working for them to first wear a red
[02:35:36.600 --> 02:35:41.480]  hat say he's a trump supporter and now come out and do this i've been around him i've talked to him a
[02:35:41.480 --> 02:35:46.680]  lot for a long time and i really don't think that's the case just to clear this up i saw some of your
[02:35:46.680 --> 02:35:52.440]  supporters saying you know nick is so nice and and got kanya to his office and got him on air and
[02:35:52.440 --> 02:35:58.440]  introduced him to kanya and and to yay and then jones did all that to poor nick i think he's
[02:35:58.440 --> 02:36:04.920]  i i've been talking to yay for a long time he never come on the show i gave his number to
[02:36:05.560 --> 02:36:10.600]  other folks to come on to my loganopolis he got nick foyntes in touch with him so people want to
[02:36:10.600 --> 02:36:14.840]  blame me for this whole fiasco i guess involved but that was me saying here get him on their shows
[02:36:14.840 --> 02:36:19.640]  that's fine go where you want to go they wanted to talk to him i gave him the number for all of
[02:36:19.640 --> 02:36:24.840]  the groipers out there that are living in lala land okay show show that's a little point i want to
[02:36:24.840 --> 02:36:29.960]  get to the now i'm gonna shut up but what about this issue of him actually being the biggest
[02:36:29.960 --> 02:36:35.560]  fundraiser ever for the adl what do you say to that well i would say it's ridiculous i think
[02:36:35.560 --> 02:36:40.120]  anybody that knows yay knows that he doesn't work for anybody other than god and his his actions
[02:36:40.120 --> 02:36:44.200]  prove that and i think if you've had a conversation with them for more than 10 minutes you know that
[02:36:44.200 --> 02:36:48.600]  he's uh one of the most authentic sincere people i've ever met and and like i said people that
[02:36:48.600 --> 02:36:53.000]  meet him for 10 minutes they come up and hug him in the street they know that as far as him being
[02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:57.880]  a fundraiser for the adl it flies in the face of the fact that if there were no adl he would be
[02:36:57.880 --> 02:37:03.240]  leading a great awakening but it was the adl that wants to shut him down and the adl was so in love
[02:37:03.240 --> 02:37:08.760]  with what he was doing why would they go to twitch as an example and say that any streamer that
[02:37:08.760 --> 02:37:14.600]  platforms yay on their channel is going to get banned and have twitch remind everybody tap at
[02:37:14.600 --> 02:37:21.480]  the sign and say we prohibit hatred we prohibit hate speech and so on the adl is working overtime
[02:37:21.480 --> 02:37:25.720]  to make sure that he's deplatformed from twitter deplatformed from twitch that nobody can have
[02:37:25.720 --> 02:37:29.960]  him on their show if it was really such a benefit to them you'd think that they'd be going around
[02:37:29.960 --> 02:37:34.840]  promoting that stuff and that gets back to the point i know i i don't think he works for the adl
[02:37:34.840 --> 02:37:39.720]  and i agree with you right and and it gets back to the point which i was making before the break
[02:37:39.720 --> 02:37:44.920]  which is that there is this i think very pernicious mindset that a lot of people have that if you
[02:37:44.920 --> 02:37:49.320]  if you start to really go after the power structure if you really say you know what
[02:37:49.320 --> 02:37:53.800]  it's jewish gangsters you know what it's the zionists it's israel people have this idea in
[02:37:53.800 --> 02:37:58.440]  their head that there's something that's not clever or not subtle about this that we've got
[02:37:58.440 --> 02:38:03.240]  to hide and be and be careful and play games i don't want to play games that that's why i'm
[02:38:03.240 --> 02:38:08.200]  up with yay because yay's not playing games anymore i know that yay's not going to be at the republican
[02:38:08.200 --> 02:38:13.880]  jewish coalition retreat in vegas begging the jews to endorse them for the 24 run i know he's
[02:38:13.880 --> 02:38:18.600]  not going to be at the zoe begging the zionists for their favor for their patronage in the race
[02:38:18.600 --> 02:38:22.840]  like trump did i know he's not going to take a hundred million dollars from shell natal sin
[02:38:22.840 --> 02:38:27.720]  and do all kinds of favors for israel and leave christians and white americans out to dry so
[02:38:27.720 --> 02:38:33.720]  you know we have to have the fight eventually we've got to lean in and go in we're in a war
[02:38:33.720 --> 02:38:38.360]  not of course violently but we've got to lean in and actually fight on the battlefield and have
[02:38:38.360 --> 02:38:43.320]  the confrontation so many people in politics want to rationalize and this isn't you because you're
[02:38:43.960 --> 02:38:47.560]  you're a courageous man and we love you we see you as an uncle quite honestly i've been watching
[02:38:47.560 --> 02:38:51.800]  you since i was in high school and all the groipers have we love you but there are a lot of people
[02:38:51.800 --> 02:38:56.360]  in the institutions who are going to rationalize their cowardice by saying oh that's just not
[02:38:56.360 --> 02:39:02.120]  smart to say that oh well it wasn't strategic to say that well at some point whether it be now
[02:39:02.120 --> 02:39:07.080]  then later we've got to say you know what the jews are not going to control the destiny of america
[02:39:07.080 --> 02:39:13.400]  israel can no longer control the destiny of america 1776 happened because we wanted to break away
[02:39:13.400 --> 02:39:18.600]  from a country thousands of miles away dictating to us what was happening in our own country but
[02:39:18.600 --> 02:39:23.080]  now we're subordinating our subordinating ourselves to israel in exactly the same way well sure
[02:39:23.080 --> 02:39:28.680]  dick i mean sure sure so let me have a few months now there's no doubt that there's foreign powers
[02:39:28.680 --> 02:39:33.160]  and corporations controlling america and there's no doubt that there's a couple different big
[02:39:33.160 --> 02:39:37.320]  jewish lobbies that are powerful and there's the chai kham lobby and a bunch of their lobbies
[02:39:37.320 --> 02:39:43.960]  but when you said earlier well you cover bill gates and the w e f and some obscure you know
[02:39:43.960 --> 02:39:49.240]  stuff those guys literally have penetrated the governments the cabinets they're running things
[02:39:49.240 --> 02:39:55.080]  they want to eugenics depopulation world government operation they've actually look who fills it up
[02:39:55.080 --> 02:39:59.400]  it's a bunch of former you know nazis grandkids and german royalty and i'm not saying it's a
[02:39:59.400 --> 02:40:06.600]  nazi conspiracy i'm saying the real power structure is a scientific transhumanist movement
[02:40:06.600 --> 02:40:11.720]  and while we're all down here battling over all these different ethnic systems they are taking
[02:40:11.720 --> 02:40:17.800]  over that's what i'm getting at yeah and i understand that i just think that a lot of it is obfuscation
[02:40:17.800 --> 02:40:22.760]  i think that like for example the world economic forum is a forum and when you look at who goes
[02:40:22.760 --> 02:40:27.400]  to davos for the retreat it's all the top government leaders it's all the business leaders and and
[02:40:27.400 --> 02:40:31.720]  they all are beholden to jewish interest so that'd be like saying you know we're gonna hold a conference
[02:40:31.720 --> 02:40:36.920]  in a shared in hotel and say the shared in hotel is the problem not not the people occupying in
[02:40:36.920 --> 02:40:41.480]  and giving the speeches and their background but i mean the billderberg group is the most
[02:40:41.480 --> 02:40:45.720]  powerful organization in the world from our research the the world economic forum is their
[02:40:45.720 --> 02:40:51.880]  mouthpiece so when we say that i mean this is this is the real supreme mafia in my view you
[02:40:51.880 --> 02:40:57.160]  know george soros is there all this so let me raise this you bring up the head of the adl
[02:40:57.160 --> 02:41:04.280]  club going on programs and here's a club saying well since ye says we have power we had to use
[02:41:04.280 --> 02:41:09.320]  our power in crushing why would he even say that talk about a dog whistle here it is
[02:41:11.400 --> 02:41:17.720]  all the proving somebody like kanya right because kanya says hey jewish people have all the power
[02:41:17.720 --> 02:41:27.880]  and then he loses everything well look that the insidious the insidious nature of anti-semitism
[02:41:27.880 --> 02:41:32.440]  and these tropes about power as kanya can say these things jews have all the power they're
[02:41:32.440 --> 02:41:39.080]  controlling everything and if we don't get him you know if we don't deal with that the myth spreads
[02:41:39.080 --> 02:41:45.960]  and it takes root if we don't get him if we don't shut him down the myth spreads wow what what a
[02:41:45.960 --> 02:41:53.160]  a he's saying exactly what what yay is saying that's right well and and that's exactly what
[02:41:53.160 --> 02:41:58.120]  i'm trying to get at here is uh when you go on twitter or facebook or instagram and i'm not
[02:41:58.120 --> 02:42:02.360]  saying you meaning you but anybody for that matter when anybody goes on twitter and says
[02:42:02.360 --> 02:42:06.360]  you could say bill gates runs the media you could say the world economic forum runs the media
[02:42:06.920 --> 02:42:11.080]  we have to acknowledge there is this strain of thought and conservatism where it's
[02:42:11.080 --> 02:42:15.240]  it's taking us into direction that the elites are not afraid of the elites don't really care about
[02:42:15.240 --> 02:42:19.400]  and and we know that because of the enforcement we know that it's like that plane with all the
[02:42:19.400 --> 02:42:23.320]  bullet holes in it that comes back and they say you know where we're going to fortify the plane
[02:42:23.320 --> 02:42:27.160]  well the planes that are coming back with the bullet holes those are the places where the
[02:42:27.160 --> 02:42:30.920]  plane can afford to be shot and it's sort of the same thing when you go on twitter and say
[02:42:30.920 --> 02:42:35.000]  you know bill gates runs the media the chai comes runs the media crickets but you go on twitter and
[02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:40.360]  say the jews run the media and you have the adl chairman going to adidas pulling your billion
[02:42:40.360 --> 02:42:45.800]  dollar deal gap well nick i gotta disagree with you there they've been really suppressing us with the
[02:42:45.800 --> 02:42:50.120]  new world order and bill gates they've been sent that came out in the documents they have been
[02:42:50.120 --> 02:42:53.560]  censoring a living hell out of people challenging that we'll be right back stay with us

[02:44:04.440 --> 02:44:11.560]  i have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics not since america to the world we are
[02:44:11.560 --> 02:44:17.800]  engaging the globalist at point blank range in the information war but i don't deserve the credit
[02:44:17.800 --> 02:44:23.240]  yes i've persevered but the listeners and viewers who support them for the real reason
[02:44:23.240 --> 02:44:29.080]  you have the success we're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order
[02:44:29.080 --> 02:44:36.680]  you've ever had we are now entering the final mile of the marathon and that's why today it's
[02:44:36.680 --> 02:44:41.160]  more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the
[02:44:41.160 --> 02:44:47.240]  efforts you've been tearing out and to intensify them god bless you all i salute you i thank you
[02:44:47.240 --> 02:44:52.040]  and i beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and this
[02:44:52.040 --> 02:44:56.920]  green is happening the fight is my fight it's your fight it's our fight god bless you all
[02:44:58.200 --> 02:45:03.720]  the tip of the spear throughout this entire process the only thing that made any republican
[02:45:03.720 --> 02:45:09.320]  victories tonight possible the only thing that made any resistance to the war machine possible
[02:45:09.320 --> 02:45:14.680]  the only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and the school
[02:45:14.680 --> 02:45:20.680]  shutdowns and and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible it made any resistance
[02:45:20.680 --> 02:45:26.680]  to it possible was people continuing to support info wars despite the massive law fair being
[02:45:26.680 --> 02:45:33.480]  waged against info wars despite the media defamatory libelist campaign against info wars the ordinary
[02:45:33.480 --> 02:45:39.240]  people the everyday people that buy products that make their own lives healthier wealthier and wiser
[02:45:39.240 --> 02:45:45.560]  is what keeps info wars on the air and what that does is keep the populist message alive in an era

[02:46:03.720 --> 02:46:09.720]  believe that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called
[02:46:09.720 --> 02:46:16.600]  vapors they associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather of course it wasn't the cold
[02:46:16.600 --> 02:46:23.560]  weather or catching a chill that killed people what was killing people was a lack of vitamin d3
[02:46:23.560 --> 02:46:30.520]  you see the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin d3 but if you're not getting
[02:46:30.520 --> 02:46:35.800]  enough sun you will not produce vitamin d3 and then it's very easy for viruses and other things
[02:46:35.800 --> 02:46:40.200]  you start replicating and taking your body over so now it's more important than ever because the

[02:46:58.200 --> 02:47:05.640]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[02:47:05.640 --> 02:47:27.080]  all right nick pointez is our guest we're having a debate here in the discussion
[02:47:27.640 --> 02:47:31.960]  about these issues he says he's good to take phone calls coming up later in the next hour
[02:47:31.960 --> 02:47:37.960]  hit some of the other big issues but so nick watching what the adl's doing watching what the
[02:47:37.960 --> 02:47:44.440]  left's doing and their racial based political system how do you see this shaking out what do
[02:47:44.440 --> 02:47:50.360]  you see happening the next few years with all of this because i gotta tell you i actually saw the
[02:47:50.360 --> 02:47:55.880]  corporate media come out against you and yay on the air and and i personally you know don't like
[02:47:55.880 --> 02:48:01.640]  any flavor of authoritarianism and and thought it was uh or a policy stunt just what i picked up from
[02:48:01.640 --> 02:48:07.000]  it i mean i don't know what was planned you're saying it wasn't planned i believe you because it
[02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:13.480]  felt completely unplanned but at the end of the day people have their first amendment how do you see
[02:48:13.480 --> 02:48:18.680]  this attempt to crush everybody going elon musk is i think not perfect but he's going a long way
[02:48:19.320 --> 02:48:25.960]  the power structure is totally discredited and what i saw on twitter and instagram and facebook
[02:48:25.960 --> 02:48:31.960]  everywhere else i've been trying to look was most people liked it they weren't even anti-semitic
[02:48:31.960 --> 02:48:37.800]  they weren't even against the democratic party and all that but they were really really just sick
[02:48:37.800 --> 02:48:42.920]  of the censorship saying screw it burn down the whole world is is is that what you're getting at
[02:48:44.920 --> 02:48:49.160]  uh it's something like that but it's a little bit bigger because it is poignant it's not just
[02:48:49.160 --> 02:48:54.040]  sort of this directionless hey screw it burn it all down it's it's a lot more directed and precise
[02:48:54.040 --> 02:48:59.000]  which is we're we're gonna finally say it with our chest uh you know a lot of people i think were
[02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:04.200]  dissatisfied with the trump uh presidency in the first term and and seemingly how little progress
[02:49:04.200 --> 02:49:09.080]  we made that's something i sort of told him at the dinner was look in 2016 the message was sort of
[02:49:09.080 --> 02:49:14.680]  insufficient here we are in 24 coming up on the 24 cycle and it's it seems like it's been
[02:49:14.680 --> 02:49:19.480]  moderated it's more moderate than it wasn't 16 things are getting worse running out of time
[02:49:19.480 --> 02:49:25.480]  and we're retreating we're moving backwards so in terms of uh joining up with yay and and
[02:49:25.480 --> 02:49:29.320]  getting on board with this movement it's about getting behind a guy who's saying we need to
[02:49:29.320 --> 02:49:34.200]  hold america to a christian standard it's about saying we need to call out the jewish media and
[02:49:34.200 --> 02:49:38.680]  and he's been saying look we don't care about your honestly we don't care about your grandmother
[02:49:38.680 --> 02:49:42.360]  that died in the holocaust i'm sorry that's always what they come with it's always the guilt
[02:49:42.360 --> 02:49:47.400]  trip it's the emotional propaganda i know that sounds callous i know that sounds insensitive
[02:49:47.400 --> 02:49:53.560]  but it's no different than any of this other racial grievance politics over slavery or over
[02:49:53.560 --> 02:49:59.240]  colonization or genocide i see no difference between aoc calling us colonizers and these
[02:49:59.240 --> 02:50:04.040]  jewish groups calling us holocaust deniers it's the same weaponization of racial grievance to
[02:50:04.040 --> 02:50:08.600]  to brow beat us into submission we've got to make our country free and independent and strong
[02:50:08.600 --> 02:50:12.840]  and that means so what you're saying is what you're saying is the left keeps calling everybody
[02:50:12.840 --> 02:50:17.320]  hitler the left keeps saying all white people are bad the left keeps saying western civilization
[02:50:17.320 --> 02:50:21.720]  is evil and so you're saying i didn't kill your great grandparents your grandparents
[02:50:21.720 --> 02:50:27.080]  i don't deserve to be called this so if you're gonna call me this i'm gonna go ahead and embrace it
[02:50:27.080 --> 02:50:31.960]  what you're saying is i'm you're not gonna live in guilt anymore that's exactly right we we can't
[02:50:31.960 --> 02:50:37.560]  change the past and god bless all the victims of every tragedy in human history but that's 2022
[02:50:37.560 --> 02:50:41.160]  we live in america i mean let's talk about this they've got national statistics out that are
[02:50:41.160 --> 02:50:47.640]  pretty accurate two percent of the south owned slaves during slavery that's a very conservative
[02:50:47.640 --> 02:50:55.720]  number it might have been lower uh but but two percent and something like maybe 10 percent
[02:50:55.720 --> 02:51:00.360]  of white population the u.s had some ancestor involved in slavery but somebody getting off
[02:51:00.360 --> 02:51:05.880]  a airplane from poland or from russia or from chentoslovakia or from germany or from the
[02:51:05.880 --> 02:51:09.960]  netherlands who never had an ancestor involved in slavery here from iceland is immediately
[02:51:09.960 --> 02:51:15.240]  told you owe reparations and you're a bad person for what you never did or your family never did
[02:51:15.240 --> 02:51:21.720]  that is preposterous uh at the same time you know i am sad that george sorrow self-round
[02:51:21.720 --> 02:51:25.960]  up jesus and get him killed i am sorry that hitler did things but i didn't do it both my
[02:51:25.960 --> 02:51:30.440]  grandfather's went and fought hitler and then i get the adl up there saying i'm hitler so i
[02:51:30.440 --> 02:51:35.720]  understand that perspective i just don't get then using hitler as a touchstone uh because
[02:51:35.720 --> 02:51:41.640]  i don't see hitler as a good person well it's i like what scott adam said about it which is
[02:51:41.640 --> 02:51:46.120]  that it sort of reframes the entire debate i mean if you considered and richard spencer
[02:51:46.120 --> 02:51:50.280]  said this as well and i think uh we disagree on a lot you know he's not a christian and
[02:51:50.280 --> 02:51:55.480]  and that's a big source of disagreement but but what about this fact that our entire morality
[02:51:55.480 --> 02:52:00.600]  and our whole political spectrum is defined by hitler it's like reductio ad hitler every
[02:52:00.600 --> 02:52:05.000]  argument has to come back to well hitler was the most evil one so whoever's the most
[02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:10.360]  proximate to hitler is the worst one is the bad one i'm a christian i'm from chicago i was born
[02:52:10.360 --> 02:52:15.160]  in 1998 hitler the holocaust what does this have to do with me what does this have to do with our
[02:52:15.160 --> 02:52:21.480]  not getting rejection of the hollywood ethos that we're all hitler and hollywood is god i i get it
[02:52:21.480 --> 02:52:26.200]  let's play a clip of scott adam's the creator of dillbert and philosopher since you raised that
[02:52:26.200 --> 02:52:35.320]  point here it is gonna add i would not rule out the fact that ye is trying to break the system and
[02:52:35.320 --> 02:52:43.800]  he might like instead of he's not trying to win the game he's trying to throw uh throw the board
[02:52:43.800 --> 02:52:49.800]  up you know what i mean he knows he can't win the game because he didn't make the rules the rules
[02:52:49.800 --> 02:52:54.600]  are made by other people and they're you know he doesn't have an advantage there so if he plays
[02:52:54.600 --> 02:53:03.400]  the game by his rules he loses but ye is not the person who loses it's not in his it's not in his
[02:53:03.400 --> 02:53:10.600]  nature to not thinking he can succeed so he just takes it to the next step what is the next step
[02:53:10.600 --> 02:53:19.000]  next step is you throw the whole board over so he came into twitter with a rallying logo
[02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:27.000]  that he might have known was not provocative in that context or as provocative he may have
[02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:33.720]  tested the limits of musk's free speech and broke it in my opinion he broke elan musk
[02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:43.880]  elan musk and it wasn't because elan musk is dumb because he's not it's not because
[02:53:43.880 --> 02:53:49.800]  elan musk is uninformed because and i'll tell you what the big takeaway here is
[02:53:51.800 --> 02:53:55.640]  the media grabbed this story and then dropped it very quickly because they didn't like the way it
[02:53:55.640 --> 02:54:01.720]  was going did you notice that too nick absolutely yeah they're terrified they don't want to have
[02:54:01.720 --> 02:54:06.680]  the conversation and and it's interesting because he goes on these shows and they brow beat him and
[02:54:06.680 --> 02:54:12.040]  they say why did you say the death con why did you say don't you care and he says well what about me
[02:54:12.040 --> 02:54:16.200]  what about my contracts what about what's going on in my world and they say well yeah yeah well
[02:54:16.200 --> 02:54:20.680]  we'll get to that we'll follow up with that you know what we'll circle back in a minute but nobody
[02:54:20.680 --> 02:54:25.000]  circling back they don't care and then they see that in the comment sections on twitter they see
[02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:29.960]  in the polls people agree with yay more people it's the same effect that there was in 16 they
[02:54:29.960 --> 02:54:34.040]  called it the silent trump vote i know you remember a lot of the zoomers who follow me
[02:54:34.040 --> 02:54:38.600]  that they were too they're like in middle school in the election happened i was freshman in college
[02:54:38.600 --> 02:54:42.600]  but they called it the silent trump vote where people agreed with trump but you know how the
[02:54:42.600 --> 02:54:47.400]  culture was if you were a magahat as i did on a college campus people people attack me in public
[02:54:47.400 --> 02:54:52.920]  they threw stuff at me they said nasty things about me online and more people than than many
[02:54:52.920 --> 02:54:57.560]  would care to admit feel the same way they're like we don't care about this this holocaust
[02:54:57.560 --> 02:55:01.880]  museum business we're sick of this adl coming around and saying there's six million and all this
[02:55:01.880 --> 02:55:06.680]  is ridiculous it's in some sense we're already past that point if we're at that point of ridicule
[02:55:06.680 --> 02:55:10.520]  if we're at that point of indifference all that needs to happen is for the rest of the process
[02:55:10.520 --> 02:55:15.560]  to play out where types like yay people like yay visionaries courageous people are going to stand up
[02:55:15.560 --> 02:55:20.280]  and say you know we don't care do it every one i mean i just gotta say though again the other
[02:55:20.280 --> 02:55:25.160]  polar opposites should not be Hitler it should be like george washington or you know jesus christ
[02:55:25.880 --> 02:55:31.320]  what do you want to cover next hour and also put your websites cozy tv where people can find your

[02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:10.600]  there it's such a shame that people are so hung up on the taboo but you know the taboo i got it but
[02:56:10.600 --> 02:56:15.240]  you guys did bring up the taboo and i think that's the whole that's the whole point but i think
[02:56:15.880 --> 02:56:21.400]  you know i have a clip of you saying that you didn't like hitler but then you yeah so
[02:56:22.840 --> 02:56:26.680]  were you okay and were you a closet hitler supporter before now you're a full hitler
[02:56:26.680 --> 02:56:32.520]  i'm not a closet hitler supporter and i i want to say this are you calling me baby hitler so
[02:56:32.520 --> 02:56:38.440]  the time travelers will kill me you ever hear everybody always says if you went back in time
[02:56:38.440 --> 02:56:42.600]  would you kill some moral dilemma would you kill hitler as a baby are you trying to confuse the
[02:56:42.600 --> 02:56:47.720]  time travelers said i didn't think of that all right next day there first amendment folks people

[03:01:01.640 --> 03:01:07.800]  there's a lot more to the yay situation than than people would uh than people are saying right now
[03:01:07.800 --> 03:01:11.480]  people are very hung up on this issue and you said and i think you're right about that it's
[03:01:11.480 --> 03:01:16.840]  it is provocative and and of course you know i had some sense that it was going to the media
[03:01:16.840 --> 03:01:21.720]  coverage would go in that direction uh but there's something really special going on with yay because
[03:01:21.720 --> 03:01:25.800]  it's not the only thing that he's talking about you know when i saw that video that he put up
[03:01:26.840 --> 03:01:32.040]  several weeks ago talking about the january six supporters and the loyalists that stood behind
[03:01:32.040 --> 03:01:37.080]  trump and how a lot of them were hung out to dry in favor of lawyers and types like jason miller
[03:01:37.080 --> 03:01:42.840]  and others when i saw that i said this is like a serious political figure i said that's a serious
[03:01:42.840 --> 03:01:47.720]  political contender he's saying the same thing that people in washington dc who worked in the
[03:01:47.720 --> 03:01:52.760]  trump administration were saying for the last six years and i know you have sources there too
[03:01:52.760 --> 03:01:57.480]  all the people that i talked to in the lighthouse would complain constantly about how actually
[03:01:57.480 --> 03:02:01.960]  it would be a mark against you if you were trying to get a job in the trump white house that you
[03:02:01.960 --> 03:02:07.480]  worked on the trump campaign in 16 so all the people that supported and believed in trump all
[03:02:07.480 --> 03:02:12.040]  the people that supported and believed in his agenda they were hung out to dry they weren't
[03:02:12.040 --> 03:02:18.360]  hired passed over and we saw the white house and and now it looks like this 2024 campaign
[03:02:18.360 --> 03:02:22.840]  had been infiltrated and subverted by people that were on the rubio campaign and and people
[03:02:22.840 --> 03:02:27.400]  in the bush white house and sort of the worst of the worst people like bill bar and mike pens
[03:02:27.400 --> 03:02:33.080]  and and mike Pompeo and nicky hailey who was in the issue is the un ambassador and john bolton
[03:02:33.080 --> 03:02:36.920]  and so i saw something like that and and that's something that he's been talking about a lot
[03:02:36.920 --> 03:02:41.880]  and and in some sense the hitler thing is overshadowed that but when the dust settles on that and it
[03:02:41.880 --> 03:02:46.120]  will it's a quick news cycle i think people are going to be very very eager and interested to
[03:02:46.120 --> 03:02:50.920]  hear what he has to say it's a true and a real alternative to a lot of the junk that we've been
[03:02:50.920 --> 03:02:57.000]  getting we're supposed to believe our two options in 24 are going to be desantis and trump and desantis
[03:02:57.000 --> 03:03:03.480]  i think you like him i'm not really huge fan and trump like i said in a very moderated form
[03:03:03.480 --> 03:03:08.760]  sort of low energy and i still love him i'd still die for him i still think he's a great hero and
[03:03:08.760 --> 03:03:13.960]  one of the great americans but he's not the same guy that he was in 16 everybody recognizes that
[03:03:13.960 --> 03:03:19.640]  and so a big part of what's so exciting for me as a young guy in the last couple months
[03:03:19.640 --> 03:03:24.760]  with everything that's going on is here's something out of all the stuff that we were put
[03:03:24.760 --> 03:03:30.280]  through you and i in the last two years and many others between january 6 and the pandemic and blm
[03:03:30.280 --> 03:03:36.280]  and the election fraud here's finally a light at the end of the tunnel here's finally a north star
[03:03:36.280 --> 03:03:41.560]  you know west but nor a maybe a west star here's something that we can finally look at and and
[03:03:41.560 --> 03:03:48.920]  actually get excited about summer what do you make a senator paul and what about i think he'd be a great
[03:03:48.920 --> 03:03:55.720]  president uh... you know i like grand paul i like him a lot i met him actually in 2016 and i
[03:03:55.720 --> 03:03:59.720]  actually worked maybe i didn't work on his campaign i think i campaign would cruise
[03:03:59.720 --> 03:04:04.200]  actually during the republican primary in 16 but i was an early supporter of it when i'm talking
[03:04:04.200 --> 03:04:08.440]  about when i was a senior in high school but i was a supporter of his i still am i think he's very
[03:04:08.440 --> 03:04:14.360]  intelligent but he's a libertarian and he's just not really my kind of conservative i know you're
[03:04:14.360 --> 03:04:19.240]  more libertarian so i think there's more overlap but i'm really more in favor of bringing back a
[03:04:19.240 --> 03:04:24.600]  very strong christian flavor of nationalism and i don't know that i love that term i feel like it's
[03:04:24.600 --> 03:04:30.040]  being hijacked but i want the government to be christian and i want us to have a true nationalism
[03:04:30.040 --> 03:04:32.760]  so it's a little bit wrong but we certainly shouldn't have an anti-christian government
[03:04:33.480 --> 03:04:39.080]  nick pointes is our guest just terrible racist things he's saying on a scale of one to ten he's
[03:04:39.080 --> 03:04:48.040]  like a two and he got the adl just so pro hitler and just so anti-white promoting ant racism that i
[03:04:48.040 --> 03:04:59.000]  just am so frightened by both groups we'll be right back stay with us i'm dr peter mccullough

[03:06:12.680 --> 03:06:18.360]  so
[03:06:19.880 --> 03:06:25.240]  what you want man hey right after this i'm gonna say you crazy i'm gonna take your family away
[03:06:25.240 --> 03:06:31.000]  from you we're not done with you yet you cannot cause free thought we have to control the history
[03:06:31.000 --> 03:06:36.360]  books we have to control the banks and we have to go and kill people absolutely
[03:06:36.360 --> 03:06:44.120]  ah you're suggesting we get rid of two-thirds of the doctors not get rid of like not violently get
[03:06:44.120 --> 03:06:52.440]  rid of them i think the jews are very intelligent but they don't deserve to be in charge of everything
[03:06:52.440 --> 03:06:58.360]  because they don't put christ and how do you legislate that they need to work for christians
[03:06:58.360 --> 03:07:03.240]  jews should work for christians i'll hire a jewish person in a second if i knew they weren't a spy
[03:07:03.240 --> 03:07:07.080]  and i could look through their phone and follow to the house and have a camera all in their living room
[03:07:10.520 --> 03:07:19.160]  i want to holler the loud funny words i like darin he is my friend i like you and him he likes me
[03:07:19.160 --> 03:07:34.920]  and i like him he likes you i hope hey man i i like his autograph it is a nice picture
[03:07:34.920 --> 03:07:42.920]  you
[03:07:45.480 --> 03:07:51.160]  when it comes to the jews here's the silver lining it tends to go from zero to 60 like
[03:07:51.160 --> 03:07:57.960]  they're not wrong about that but there's a reason for that and the reason is them okay when it comes
[03:07:57.960 --> 03:08:06.040]  to the jews every society where has gone down with these people it always goes from zero to 60
[03:08:06.040 --> 03:08:15.000]  and never starts with burning all the talmuds in paris okay never starts that way but frequently
[03:08:15.000 --> 03:08:22.920]  it seems to end that way and it gets there very rapidly doesn't start there but it frequently
[03:08:22.920 --> 03:08:29.160]  ends there but i would say that the jews had better start being nice to people like us
[03:08:30.280 --> 03:08:37.400]  because what comes out of this is going to be a lot uglier and a lot worse for them than anything
[03:08:37.400 --> 03:08:42.760]  that's being said on this show or has been said on this show in spite of the fact that i have been
[03:08:42.760 --> 03:08:48.440]  bullied by the jews and i have been oppressed and slandered and lied about and attacked by the jews
[03:08:48.440 --> 03:08:57.320]  i have been completely precise for the most part and even handed and nuanced about my view about
[03:08:57.320 --> 03:09:08.520]  the situation and i'm also a christian which is going to matter because there it could be a lot
[03:09:08.520 --> 03:09:14.440]  worse i'm going to say than this show and what's going to come out of this could be like i said
[03:09:14.440 --> 03:09:19.160]  it could be a lot uglier than what we say on the show i know that there are other people that
[03:09:19.160 --> 03:09:24.280]  are going to push farther than that once this conversation really starts and the jews are
[03:09:24.280 --> 03:09:31.160]  going to look at people like me in america first and say damn i miss when it was just that funny
[03:09:31.160 --> 03:09:37.880]  guy and we've pushed so hard and then this and that because because history has shown that once
[03:09:37.880 --> 03:09:42.600]  his train gets going you know blacks are overrepresented in violent crime but when you
[03:09:42.600 --> 03:09:47.480]  meet an individual black person you don't apply that you start with a fresh slate every time you
[03:09:47.480 --> 03:09:56.120]  meet someone do you do that with jews nope this intervention isn't going very well
[03:10:02.840 --> 03:10:08.360]  all right i mean i just got to say it i think basing things on race is really bad news but the
[03:10:08.360 --> 03:10:12.920]  left and the adl and others are saying all white people are racist and demonizing our founding
[03:10:12.920 --> 03:10:19.800]  fathers and trying to destroy our country and so i wonder why it is what i see is the adl's trying
[03:10:19.800 --> 03:10:26.120]  to conjure this anti-semitism to get more funding and more power and more control over people and
[03:10:26.120 --> 03:10:30.280]  they worship people like george sorrell snothers and help round up jews and so many of the jews
[03:10:31.560 --> 03:10:35.400]  that that that that that have been killed in history out of the name of this have been completely
[03:10:35.400 --> 03:10:41.880]  innocent people i really just don't think jews are one big monolith nick and again you really i
[03:10:41.880 --> 03:10:46.280]  think spoke to it earlier in the last hour where you said well you're off over there on these kind
[03:10:46.280 --> 03:10:51.800]  of side issues of bill gates the wef and you know this stuff but that you know we're over here with
[03:10:51.800 --> 03:11:00.040]  the jews the wef and the big corporations the new world order and gg ping are mass murdering people
[03:11:00.040 --> 03:11:05.800]  are bringing in tyranny and lockdowns and world ids and controls and whether they're chinese or
[03:11:05.800 --> 03:11:10.680]  whether they're german or jewish i'm just opposing these tyrannical objectives and i kind of want
[03:11:10.680 --> 03:11:15.880]  a big tent for all of that and i just think it's it's it's it's a first amendment but i do think
[03:11:15.880 --> 03:11:23.160]  it's dangerous to then sit there and just invoke all of this and say that jews are the
[03:11:23.720 --> 03:11:27.880]  powerful jewish mafias who basically run the world i mean is that what you're saying
[03:11:27.880 --> 03:11:34.360]  yes and and i think they do i i don't even think it's really disputed anymore after what happened
[03:11:34.360 --> 03:11:39.400]  to yay in that clip that you played with greenblatt from the adl i look at him i mean he was somebody
[03:11:39.400 --> 03:11:45.160]  who even in 2018 four years ago was saying things that are regarded as politically incorrect and
[03:11:45.160 --> 03:11:49.080]  people throw that around they say well that's politically incorrect like it's just you know
[03:11:49.080 --> 03:11:54.440]  broad nebulous thing it's actually very specific he said like partisan conservative talking points
[03:11:54.440 --> 03:11:59.800]  in 18 and he was just fine and he's he went on tucker carlson and he he called out china and
[03:11:59.800 --> 03:12:04.600]  called out a lot of things and he was just fine then he switched up on the jews he was banned from
[03:12:04.600 --> 03:12:08.760]  fox news he was banned from daily wire and you don't have to go through the whole list but we've
[03:12:08.760 --> 03:12:15.400]  all seen the cascading effect of this adidas you'll cut gap you'll cut his bank froze tens of
[03:12:15.400 --> 03:12:20.760]  millions of dollars you know i mean it's unbelievable if that doesn't prove it and then the adl is
[03:12:20.760 --> 03:12:24.920]  going around now and they're not just fundraising but they're passing around a letter in congress
[03:12:24.920 --> 03:12:29.080]  and they're demanding that nobody give them a platform they're getting him kicked off twitter
[03:12:29.080 --> 03:12:34.360]  it goes on and on and on and so i don't even think it's even in dispute anymore that jews have a
[03:12:34.360 --> 03:12:39.480]  and you know maybe you would qualm about whether it's all of the power or just like a lot of it
[03:12:39.480 --> 03:12:43.800]  or a majority of it but it's true that there are these jew and and there are jewish groups
[03:12:43.800 --> 03:12:48.920]  republican jewish congress zionist organization of america adl these are all jewish groups
[03:12:48.920 --> 03:12:52.600]  world jewish congress called for apple and spotify and and you know
[03:12:53.240 --> 03:12:58.200]  that's kind of like asking a question in itself what what is the world jewish congress
[03:12:58.200 --> 03:13:02.040]  did you know that the state department's definition of antisemitism says that if you
[03:13:02.040 --> 03:13:07.560]  believe that jews can spy on a global level that you're an antisemite well then how do you
[03:13:07.560 --> 03:13:11.240]  acknowledge the existence of the world jewish congress which is real they did an article
[03:13:11.240 --> 03:13:16.440]  about it in newsweek last week without being an antisemite i mean it's they also go on to say
[03:13:16.440 --> 03:13:23.480]  that if you call israel comparable to hitler or the nazis which you have 20 years ago in 2001
[03:13:23.480 --> 03:13:28.360]  they say that's a definition of antisemite well i said some of the yeah i mean the adl
[03:13:28.360 --> 03:13:32.360]  has said to take it off their website but it's on the way back machine said they support
[03:13:32.360 --> 03:13:39.560]  anti-race mixing laws in israel uh and they support uh basically taking lands away from people that
[03:13:39.560 --> 03:13:47.240]  aren't jewish and they support uh i mean they said we can't have replacement migration or israel
[03:13:47.240 --> 03:13:54.600]  won't be jewish so i mean you're i'm not denying that israel lives by a second set of rules but
[03:13:54.600 --> 03:13:59.160]  how do you square it up that jews in israel have been under the most draconian lockdowns in the
[03:13:59.160 --> 03:14:04.280]  world after china had been given the deadly shot and one of the highest death rates from the shot
[03:14:04.280 --> 03:14:10.360]  i mean if they're all powerful why is this biomedical tyranny targeting them and doing that to them well
[03:14:10.360 --> 03:14:15.240]  i think that that's just a symptom of the elite i think that's a symptom of hubris i i don't know
[03:14:15.240 --> 03:14:21.320]  for example that the vaccine is created to kill people or something i think that the covid thing
[03:14:21.320 --> 03:14:26.280]  is very complicated there's a lot of journalism there just kind of like bill gates wf alice is off
[03:14:26.280 --> 03:14:31.720]  on a side side tangent the the shot's not the centerpiece of their takeover it's it's not
[03:14:31.720 --> 03:14:39.080]  depopulation 20 million dead at least uh races european system in israel is is is the worst country
[03:14:39.080 --> 03:14:44.680]  for me being given the poison shot their lockdowns are the second worst well wouldn't even make any
[03:14:44.680 --> 03:14:48.920]  sense because if they were going around giving everybody the vaccine and that's supposed to take
[03:14:48.920 --> 03:14:52.920]  out everybody well who are the most vaccine hesitant who's who's going to be remaining when
[03:14:52.920 --> 03:14:57.480]  they're and don't get me wrong i think the shot is deadly i didn't get vaccinated at all but i the
[03:14:57.480 --> 03:15:02.760]  idea that this is some kind of that that the georgia guide stones are dictating global politics
[03:15:02.760 --> 03:15:07.160]  i think is just ridiculous and i think it's one of these things that sourcing them led by
[03:15:08.120 --> 03:15:12.280]  the founder of cnn put that up i mean they do believe in depopulation as i was saying
[03:15:12.280 --> 03:15:17.240]  nick there is a larger depopulation globalist agenda and that gets into who funded hitler and
[03:15:17.240 --> 03:15:22.840]  how they set him up and this powerful group that's that's that's that's next level uh it's the
[03:15:22.840 --> 03:15:30.360]  transhumanist man it's you know to me uh that's what's going on yeah i just don't know how convincing
[03:15:30.360 --> 03:15:33.560]  that is i think when you look at these raw demonstrations how convincing hitler was for
[03:15:33.560 --> 03:15:39.240]  government push euthanasia hitler was for abortion hitler was for all these things the left supports
[03:15:39.240 --> 03:15:45.320]  today yeah but i again i just think if you look at the conversation these past three weeks it's
[03:15:45.320 --> 03:15:49.720]  pretty clear who's who's in control and it's not bill gates and it's not china and take a look at
[03:15:49.720 --> 03:15:53.320]  and listen i don't mean this in any kind of offensive way but you went on crowded
[03:15:53.320 --> 03:15:56.280]  they try to get alive i'll let you come back we got a hard break
[03:15:57.560 --> 03:16:04.440]  climb to the top of the food chain with alpha power by info wars life for those who want to
[03:16:04.440 --> 03:16:11.160]  increase testosterone and energy levels most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline
[03:16:11.160 --> 03:16:18.040]  starting around 30 at a rate of about one to two percent per year this drop can show signs such as

[03:20:23.000 --> 03:20:44.840]  uh
[03:20:44.840 --> 03:20:56.400]  We got hard satellite brakes. I'm sure the grouper will say that was all a big conspiracy
[03:20:56.400 --> 03:21:06.660]  but our brakes are at 16 and 29 and like 46. So we had to go to break there. The point
[03:21:06.660 --> 03:21:09.960]  you were making, Nick, when we went to break, please continue.
[03:21:09.960 --> 03:21:16.040]  Yeah, between you and Tumor 95, I'm getting killed in this debate.
[03:21:16.040 --> 03:21:22.760]  No, you were bringing up Stephen Crowder. I'm kidding, I'm giving it a hard time. But
[03:21:22.760 --> 03:21:27.640]  the point I'm trying to make is I'm somebody who everybody knows me as like the Holocaust
[03:21:27.640 --> 03:21:31.680]  and I are anti-Semite. Yeah, I talk about other things other than that too, but that's
[03:21:31.680 --> 03:21:38.120]  sort of what I'm billed as, labeled, categorized and I'm not permitted basically anywhere.
[03:21:38.120 --> 03:21:42.480]  I'm banned from everything. I'm banned from all social media. I'm also banned and basically
[03:21:42.480 --> 03:21:46.400]  not allowed. I'm ostracized in the entire conservative movement. The point I'm trying
[03:21:46.400 --> 03:21:49.200]  to make and again, I'm not trying to, it's not a competition. I'm not trying to give
[03:21:49.200 --> 03:21:53.520]  you a hard time, but you did a show last week with Crowder and Crowder's talking about,
[03:21:53.520 --> 03:21:58.000]  I've been in many a synagogues and Crowder's the guy who hasn't, you know, he's pretended
[03:21:58.000 --> 03:22:01.800]  not to know me for the last two years now that this big news story came out. Now he
[03:22:01.800 --> 03:22:06.840]  knows who I am and he hates me and he's doing Apple research and I'm a rabid anti-Semite.
[03:22:06.840 --> 03:22:11.400]  I was on Elijah Shaffer's show on the blaze almost a year ago exactly and he almost got
[03:22:11.400 --> 03:22:17.280]  fired for having me on the show. And so clearly, clearly there is some disparity in treatment
[03:22:17.280 --> 03:22:21.800]  between people that are talking about this very heavily and people that are not. And
[03:22:21.800 --> 03:22:25.920]  I think everybody knows that there are, you derive some benefit and there is some cover
[03:22:25.920 --> 03:22:30.240]  and we hear, I hear this refrain my entire career. Well, it's those left-wing Jews and
[03:22:30.240 --> 03:22:33.760]  they're not even really Jews or it's those atheists, but they're atheists. They're not
[03:22:33.760 --> 03:22:38.800]  Jews or atheists, but these Hasidic Jews, these Orthodox, these religious ones, they
[03:22:38.800 --> 03:22:42.480]  are closest allies. I mean, these guys are really right-wing. I think you get a little
[03:22:42.480 --> 03:22:45.600]  bit of cover for that. I'm not going to lie. I don't think you're getting calls, but I
[03:22:45.600 --> 03:22:49.680]  do think that I'm not out of, I don't think I'm saying any telling out of tales out of
[03:22:49.680 --> 03:22:53.880]  school here that that does provide some cover for people to hedge and say that they're right
[03:22:53.880 --> 03:22:54.880]  to be drove back.
[03:22:54.880 --> 03:22:58.200]  Really, well, I'm getting cover. If I'm getting cover, I didn't know it. Take Dr. Zebsalinko,
[03:22:58.200 --> 03:23:02.400]  who early on exposed COVID had a lot of courage and died recently and he's an awesome guy.
[03:23:02.400 --> 03:23:06.880]  I've actually studied the geopolitics and sub-politics different nations quite a bit.
[03:23:06.880 --> 03:23:12.840]  I find it fascinating. The left-wing Jews and Israel persecute the Orthodox Jews and
[03:23:12.840 --> 03:23:16.840]  take away their kids and do all sorts of stuff to them. So, like you're saying that his
[03:23:16.840 --> 03:23:22.040]  Hasidic Jews, I mean, one of the biggest groups in Hasidic Jews doesn't think Israel should
[03:23:22.040 --> 03:23:30.000]  exist. So, I think it's more complex, Nick, than what you're saying.
[03:23:30.000 --> 03:23:33.520]  I agree with you that there are Jewish factions, but the one thing that they're all on the
[03:23:33.520 --> 03:23:37.920]  same page about is that they're all on Team Jew and they all spit on Christians. And this
[03:23:37.920 --> 03:23:43.120]  is a well-known thing. You go to Israel and they literally spit on Christians. And it's
[03:23:43.120 --> 03:23:48.320]  so tragic that there are so many Christian Zionists or Christian Philo-Semites. These
[03:23:48.320 --> 03:23:53.000]  are not the Jews of the Old Testament. These are rabbinical Jews that, and I talked about
[03:23:53.000 --> 03:23:58.840]  this on the Yay interview, they believe in the Talmud. They're a rabbinical interpretation
[03:23:58.840 --> 03:24:05.000]  of the Hebrew Bible. It's almost like it's abrogated inspired scripture. And so, they're
[03:24:05.000 --> 03:24:09.960]  looking more towards the Talmud where you have rabbis correcting God. And their interpretation
[03:24:09.960 --> 03:24:15.520]  of the 613 commandments laid out in the Hebrew Bible, they defer when there's a conflict
[03:24:15.520 --> 03:24:20.240]  between God and the rabbis, they defer to the rabbis. This is not the same people. This
[03:24:20.240 --> 03:24:25.240]  is not the same book. They're not our people. They do not share our best interests. And
[03:24:25.240 --> 03:24:29.440]  they don't even see us as equals. And you said this, I saw a clip from you on the day
[03:24:29.440 --> 03:24:34.880]  after 9-11, you said that they call the Palestinians Goyim. They call us animals. And that's how
[03:24:34.880 --> 03:24:39.240]  they regard non-Jews. It's Jews and they're in a big club and there's a lot of fighting
[03:24:39.240 --> 03:24:40.240]  in there.
[03:24:40.240 --> 03:24:41.880]  How old were you on September 11, 2001?
[03:24:41.880 --> 03:24:42.880]  I was three.
[03:24:42.880 --> 03:24:50.680]  Man, I'm getting old here. Well, look, here's where I'm at on this, Nick. And I want to
[03:24:50.680 --> 03:24:56.800]  make some calls coming up. You say this whole thing about Bill Gates' society issue. No,
[03:24:56.800 --> 03:25:03.880]  that's the central issue. And I see this whole leftist thing saying America's Hitler and
[03:25:03.880 --> 03:25:10.600]  the leftist scripture Captain America. I see it just as what it is. And I just hope that
[03:25:10.600 --> 03:25:15.320]  all of us can come together and transcend the casual society and the world government,
[03:25:15.320 --> 03:25:19.400]  the forced injections and the imploding borders. And I'm just trying to get everybody together
[03:25:19.400 --> 03:25:24.560]  on those issues instead of obsessing about different groups all day. You know, there's
[03:25:24.560 --> 03:25:29.000]  whole groups that Catholics run everything. And I don't think that's the case. And I don't
[03:25:29.000 --> 03:25:33.600]  think that Jews run everything. I mean, who do you think runs China with a billion, five
[03:25:33.600 --> 03:25:35.600]  hundred million people?
[03:25:35.600 --> 03:25:39.560]  I think the Chinese run China. And I think that's why, I mean, there are problems in
[03:25:39.560 --> 03:25:45.240]  China, but China is a country that is fighting ruthlessly for its own self-interest. And
[03:25:45.240 --> 03:25:48.760]  you could say that it's a tyrannical state, but China's always been a tyrannical state.
[03:25:48.760 --> 03:25:54.080]  They're a different kind of society. The Chinese people are very collectivist. They're very
[03:25:54.080 --> 03:25:58.720]  societally minded. They're very obedient and deferential. And that's their culture and that's
[03:25:58.720 --> 03:25:59.720]  who they are.
[03:25:59.720 --> 03:26:03.920]  But there's no question that the Chinese Standing Committee and Xi Jinping are going
[03:26:03.920 --> 03:26:08.280]  out to bat every day to get great trade deals for China in the way that our Jewish leaders
[03:26:08.280 --> 03:26:13.080]  in America are not working for people in Oklahoma and Iowa. Does anybody believe the Hollywood
[03:26:13.080 --> 03:26:17.240]  Jews in LA and the finance Jews in New York and the government Jews in DC and the ones
[03:26:17.240 --> 03:26:22.380]  in South Florida, does anybody think they care at all? They give a damn about people
[03:26:22.380 --> 03:26:28.080]  in Texas or people in Kansas or people in Iowa. They don't in the same way that you
[03:26:28.080 --> 03:26:32.520]  could say Putin or Xi Jinping care, I think about their countrymen or Assad cares about
[03:26:32.520 --> 03:26:33.800]  the people of Syria.
[03:26:33.800 --> 03:26:38.920]  And that's really the conflict is we've got this separate nation on top of ours. And they're
[03:26:38.920 --> 03:26:43.120]  not the only one. There's other Saudi Arabia's influential, the Qataris, the Emiratis are
[03:26:43.120 --> 03:26:47.480]  influential, Chai comms are a real problem. They spy on our country. But there's only
[03:26:47.480 --> 03:26:51.120]  one that no one's permitted to talk about. You can hear about all those issues on the
[03:26:51.120 --> 03:26:56.320]  war room and you can hear about them on Tucker Carlson and Fox and Mike Pompeo can say them.
[03:26:56.320 --> 03:27:01.240]  But there's one very powerful gangster group that you talk about it and it's an instant
[03:27:01.240 --> 03:27:05.280]  ban. It's an instant kill shot. In some cases, they literally threaten to take your life.
[03:27:05.280 --> 03:27:10.240]  So I agree. I don't mean to reduce it all to something that's so simple, but we can't
[03:27:10.240 --> 03:27:14.680]  describe the society without bringing that into it. And that's why I wanted to have the
[03:27:14.680 --> 03:27:21.160]  actual intellectual side of this discussion here today. And, you know, I personally think
[03:27:21.160 --> 03:27:25.400]  that everybody that gets sucked into this black hole is giving power to it. And that's
[03:27:25.400 --> 03:27:29.200]  what some of the senator forces manipulating groups want. And I think we have to transcend
[03:27:29.200 --> 03:27:33.800]  things on policy and ideas and actual issues and the fruits of the tree. We're going to
[03:27:33.800 --> 03:27:38.040]  break here in a few minutes. It's your chance unfiltered folks. We don't screen the calls.
[03:27:38.040 --> 03:27:41.400]  Just have a good, clean phone line. Tell us where you're calling from and don't cuss.
[03:27:41.400 --> 03:27:50.200]  We're in a lot of radio stations. We can't have that. The toll free number is 877-789-2539-877-789.
[03:27:50.200 --> 03:27:58.160]  Alex, 877-789-2539. We're talking about the Yale interview, Nick Fuentes today. Censorship.
[03:27:58.160 --> 03:28:03.400]  We'll talk about Elon Musk coming up. What Nick Fuentes thinks of what he's really doing.
[03:28:03.400 --> 03:28:08.000]  Look, he's human me-band, but overall he's bringing a lot of great folks back and exposing
[03:28:08.000 --> 03:28:12.520]  the death shot, the medical tyranny. So I like that. I like the Santas talking about
[03:28:12.520 --> 03:28:20.000]  their setting up a statewide prosecution through these grand juries of the vaccine makers.
[03:28:20.000 --> 03:28:25.040]  I mean, that's where I'm at. And so you can say who runs it or who's behind it. I'm just
[03:28:25.040 --> 03:28:29.880]  going to oppose pedophilia. I don't care who's behind it. I'm going to oppose fractional
[03:28:29.880 --> 03:28:33.320]  reserve banking. I don't care who's behind it. I'm going to be issue oriented. And that's
[03:28:33.320 --> 03:28:43.320]  what I do. But we're going to take your phone calls coming up 877-789-2539, 877-789-ALEXINFOWARDS.COM.
[03:28:43.320 --> 03:28:50.280]  Tomorrow's news today will be right back with Nick Fuentes straight ahead. And then in 30
[03:28:50.280 --> 03:29:00.280]  minutes, the War Room with Alan Shroyer.
[03:29:20.280 --> 03:29:28.800]  And you can do that now at infowarstore.com. Help us clear out our stock of bodies, tumor,
[03:29:28.800 --> 03:29:34.000]  vitamin C with zinc and alpha power. Turn those shady Federal Reserve notes into the

[03:30:09.000 --> 03:30:14.480]  we're going directly to the source that was supplying the supplement companies that we

[03:30:47.640 --> 03:30:56.840]  MD now exclusively available at infowarstore.com with massive, massive sales.
[03:30:56.840 --> 03:31:02.720]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[03:31:02.720 --> 03:31:08.720]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit. The First Amendment
[03:31:08.720 --> 03:31:12.960]  is unique in the world. That's what they want to take away, your ability to speak freely.
[03:31:12.960 --> 03:31:16.160]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next, or they're going to go for Steve Bannon, or
[03:31:16.160 --> 03:31:19.480]  they're going to go for Tucker Carlson. I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but on
[03:31:19.480 --> 03:31:23.680]  air 28 years. And I knew they were planning all of this. And I warned the public as a
[03:31:23.680 --> 03:31:27.680]  modern Paul Revere. But I couldn't have done it without your support. And now because we've
[03:31:27.680 --> 03:31:31.560]  been so successful warning the population of the planet, not just America, we're public
[03:31:31.560 --> 03:31:35.600]  enemy number one when it comes to globalist agenda. That's why it's more important than
[03:31:35.600 --> 03:31:40.440]  ever to realize how successful Infowars has been because of your past support. So I salute

[03:32:52.880 --> 03:32:57.880]  A true 361.
[03:32:57.880 --> 03:33:16.880]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:16.880 --> 03:33:23.880]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance. Live from Austin, Texas,
[03:33:23.880 --> 03:33:44.880]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:44.880 --> 03:33:50.960]  I'm Alex Jones, your host. And let me just make my point here and I'm basically done
[03:33:50.960 --> 03:33:57.400]  debating and arguing all this. I don't judge Nick Fuentes, even though I disagree with him
[03:33:57.400 --> 03:34:04.040]  on some issues here, because you can't have the left viciously saying that white people
[03:34:04.040 --> 03:34:08.040]  are inherently the devil. I have stacks of articles here where major universities in
[03:34:08.040 --> 03:34:13.360]  Michigan, California, New York are going to make white people wear badges that digitally
[03:34:13.360 --> 03:34:19.320]  track them and don't let them go in certain areas. And who's running that? The ADL. The
[03:34:19.320 --> 03:34:23.680]  ADL, after the last three conferences, said I'm the number one enemy. We track the lawsuits,
[03:34:23.680 --> 03:34:27.880]  the attacks, everything to them. But I'm not going to blame the average Jew for what that
[03:34:27.880 --> 03:34:33.320]  horrible mafia is doing to me and my family, who actually use Hitler tactics. My issue
[03:34:33.320 --> 03:34:39.280]  here is I've studied eugenics. I've studied the New World Order. Francis Galton, 1850,
[03:34:39.280 --> 03:34:43.600]  owns the eugenics organization. They developed the whole plan. They create the Rockefeller
[03:34:43.600 --> 03:34:49.040]  Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, the Cold Springs Harbor operation. Hitler is a spinoff of that.
[03:34:49.040 --> 03:34:54.240]  Hitler's for euthanasia. Hitler's for planned societies. I oppose that because it is an
[03:34:54.240 --> 03:34:59.760]  offshoot of this eugenics operation. And I'm an expert on it. I know all about it. And
[03:34:59.760 --> 03:35:04.520]  I don't just read history books. I'm not going to tell the whole story here. And I've never
[03:35:04.520 --> 03:35:11.720]  even told the whole story because it's amazing. But again, Dallas, Texas, one side of my grandfather's
[03:35:11.720 --> 03:35:18.360]  family were old Texans. The other side, the Hammons were Germans who come here pretty recently.
[03:35:18.360 --> 03:35:23.960]  And they were not Jewish. They were blonde, air blue eyed. And they were in World War
[03:35:23.960 --> 03:35:28.440]  II. And they know what went on. And they told me no, Hitler was bad. And they told me what
[03:35:28.440 --> 03:35:33.480]  went on and how the rich Germans in Dallas, once Hitler got into power in 33, they would
[03:35:33.480 --> 03:35:38.120]  blackmail German family members, not my family, but people that my grandfather worked with
[03:35:38.120 --> 03:35:42.680]  and suck money out of them. And so what I heard about Hitler doing that and blackmailing people
[03:35:42.680 --> 03:35:48.760]  and sucking money, my family told me went on. So I grew up actually hearing about all of that.
[03:35:48.760 --> 03:35:55.000]  Then my grandfather worked in secret weapons programs. And I only heard a little bit of it
[03:35:55.000 --> 03:35:58.520]  that my mom heard him talk about. He would never talk about it. But I remember him bitching when
[03:35:58.520 --> 03:36:04.040]  I'm like eight years old about in weapons projects and how he knew he went and he knew
[03:36:04.040 --> 03:36:08.600]  Werner von Braun, all of it and how he had to deal with these damn Nazis and how arrogant
[03:36:08.600 --> 03:36:13.080]  they were and how he didn't like them. So I mean, I grew up with both grandfathers have been in
[03:36:13.080 --> 03:36:18.840]  World War II. They both dealt with the Nazis and they both didn't like Nazis. And so I didn't get
[03:36:18.840 --> 03:36:21.880]  it from Captain America. I didn't get it from Hollywood. I didn't get it from any of that.
[03:36:21.880 --> 03:36:25.880]  I got it from my badass grandfather. So now I look at people today like, I look like these
[03:36:25.880 --> 03:36:30.120]  guys were freaking badasses. And you know, they don't make men like that anymore. So
[03:36:30.120 --> 03:36:35.400]  that's where I met. But that said, you can't criticize Nick Fuentes for what he's saying
[03:36:35.400 --> 03:36:41.560]  when the left is literally redlining the engine when it comes to race-based politics and the ADL
[03:36:41.560 --> 03:36:46.600]  is captaining it, teaching elementary students, they're inherently bad because of what color they
[03:36:46.600 --> 03:36:53.880]  are. But my issue is I'm not going to sink to the level of the ADL. But I say mess around, find out
[03:36:53.880 --> 03:36:57.320]  like Nick Fuentes said earlier, you think Nick Fuentes is your ultimate enemy.
[03:36:58.520 --> 03:37:05.640]  The support for what you said was 50-50. I wanted to demarcate the fact that I'm not for
[03:37:05.640 --> 03:37:09.800]  authoritarianism and I don't agree with what happened, what some of the things he said. I don't
[03:37:09.800 --> 03:37:13.720]  agree with the censorship and what's happened to him, but I'm not in league with that whole
[03:37:13.720 --> 03:37:18.920]  worldview. So that's where I'm at. We've got loaded phone lines for Nick Fuentes and myself
[03:37:18.920 --> 03:37:24.040]  right now. Daniel called in earlier before I went to you. He wanted to bring up Bible verses
[03:37:24.040 --> 03:37:28.120]  and synagogue of Satan stuff. I said, why don't you hold till Nick Fuentes is on? Nick's here.
[03:37:28.120 --> 03:37:34.040]  Go ahead and make your point, Daniel. So I wanted to say that there are a lot of different sides
[03:37:34.040 --> 03:37:40.440]  to the question. And when you don't have all the sides, you end up with evangelical Zionism or
[03:37:41.160 --> 03:37:47.800]  other over-emphatic views that the emphasize one or another point of the discussion of the
[03:37:47.800 --> 03:37:56.040]  Jews. And the fact is that the Jews do have a lot of blessings just inherited from the righteousness
[03:37:56.040 --> 03:38:01.880]  of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, from the forefathers. They have callings and blessings. But in Malachi,
[03:38:01.880 --> 03:38:08.360]  it says that God will curse their blessings because they have not honored His name. So here you have
[03:38:08.360 --> 03:38:14.040]  people who are lost, but they have inherited all these blessings because of their forefathers.
[03:38:14.040 --> 03:38:19.160]  And these blessings are just being shot in every direction. And they're out against each other.
[03:38:19.160 --> 03:38:24.520]  They fight against the world. It says in 1 Thessalonians 2.15, they are displeasing to God
[03:38:24.520 --> 03:38:29.240]  and hostile to all men, which includes themselves, which is the answer to your question, Alex.
[03:38:29.240 --> 03:38:35.960]  How come they're killing so many people in Israel? They are aiming their weapons, blessings,
[03:38:35.960 --> 03:38:41.720]  everything and everybody, including themselves. Why? Because it says that in Galatians 4.21 through
[03:38:41.720 --> 03:38:49.320]  31, it describes how they are our persecutor. They are the Ishmael to us Christians, the Isaac.
[03:38:49.320 --> 03:38:55.640]  We are allegorically Isaac. They are allegorically Ishmael. And if you look at who Ishmael is in
[03:38:55.640 --> 03:39:01.640]  Genesis 16, verse 12, it says, he will be a wild donkey of a man, his hand against all his brothers.
[03:39:02.520 --> 03:39:05.720]  So this is really the answer to a lot of the questions.
[03:39:05.720 --> 03:39:08.760]  All right. I got to jump to a lot of other callers here. Let me get Nick Fuentes'
[03:39:08.760 --> 03:39:15.400]  take on what you just said, Nick. Yeah, I think that's all great. And I think it's so important
[03:39:15.400 --> 03:39:19.800]  to emphasize, and this is something I want to get to before the last break, is Alex,
[03:39:19.800 --> 03:39:24.040]  you said you wanted to transcend all these things. There's only one way to transcend anything,
[03:39:24.040 --> 03:39:28.360]  and that's through Christ. The answer is not Hitler. The answer is not national socialism.
[03:39:28.360 --> 03:39:34.280]  The answer to what's going on right now and the Jewish influence or whatever, all the influences,
[03:39:34.280 --> 03:39:38.280]  is for us to follow people that follow Jesus Christ. And it's that simple.
[03:39:38.280 --> 03:39:43.560]  But while Jesus Christ is not born a Jew, he said, I came to fulfill the Old Testament,
[03:39:43.560 --> 03:39:49.640]  not to destroy it. So I mean, I love how people that hate Jews then follow Jesus,
[03:39:49.640 --> 03:39:53.560]  which I do. Jesus is a Messiah. Don't you see there's a paradox here?
[03:39:54.760 --> 03:39:59.400]  It's not a paradox at all because Jesus Christ was the fulfillment of the law. And so who are the
[03:39:59.400 --> 03:40:04.360]  Jews that remain? It's the Jews that are still holding on to old sacrifices and old ways of
[03:40:04.360 --> 03:40:08.200]  doing things. And like I said, that's where you get the Mishnah, and that's where you get the
[03:40:08.200 --> 03:40:14.680]  Talmud, and that's where you get the idolization of the law for its own sake and the idolization
[03:40:14.680 --> 03:40:17.960]  of the law and ritual for its own sake rather than the Lamb.
[03:40:17.960 --> 03:40:23.160]  But the leftist Jews are literally at war with the Hasidic Jews. That's not a fake war. They're
[03:40:23.160 --> 03:40:28.040]  literally persecuting the hell out of them. Look at New York, how New York attacked the
[03:40:28.040 --> 03:40:33.320]  ultra-Orthodox. The Jews are not at war with each other. The only times they even crit it,
[03:40:33.320 --> 03:40:37.000]  they're not. They're simply not. They're their rival factions, certainly.
[03:40:37.000 --> 03:40:41.320]  But at the end of the day, they're all on the same side. The only reason the ZOA
[03:40:41.320 --> 03:40:47.320]  criticized the ADL is because they said, hey, ADL, your anti-white hatred is actually confusing
[03:40:47.320 --> 03:40:51.880]  people and people think Jews are white and they're not liking Jews. So could you please stop it?
[03:40:51.880 --> 03:40:56.360]  But they didn't say that on behalf of the white people, and the ZOA is considered a more conservative
[03:40:56.360 --> 03:41:01.480]  Jewish group. So it's not to say that they're a monolith. They're not a monolith. Like you said,
[03:41:01.480 --> 03:41:04.520]  there's intense factionalism. I'll say on the call then. Let's get the calls.
[03:41:04.520 --> 03:41:09.400]  Chris in Kentucky here on the air. Go ahead. Yeah, thanks for taking my call. I just want
[03:41:09.400 --> 03:41:15.720]  to talk about this whole interview in the context of my daughter and I listening to that interview
[03:41:15.720 --> 03:41:22.760]  together later in the day after I picked her up from her basketball practice. And I just can't,
[03:41:23.880 --> 03:41:29.400]  I can't say how much empathy, just can't express how much empathy she had for you, Alex. I just
[03:41:29.400 --> 03:41:39.400]  kind of felt like you were hijacked. And I really feel like this whole conversation stems from being,
[03:41:40.360 --> 03:41:47.320]  I hate to say this, but spiritually immature and not truly understanding
[03:41:49.480 --> 03:41:57.560]  the Jewish people. I've heard rabbis talk about Jews in particular and growing the distinction
[03:41:57.560 --> 03:42:05.320]  from secular Jews and the evil that they're doing in this world. We can look all throughout the
[03:42:05.320 --> 03:42:10.760]  Bible. Jesus is not just the God of the New Testament. He's the God of the Old Testament too.
[03:42:12.120 --> 03:42:17.240]  And they are God's covenant people. But I do know this at the end of the day,
[03:42:18.360 --> 03:42:23.720]  every knee will bow, every tongue will confess, and that includes everybody, not any specific
[03:42:23.720 --> 03:42:29.400]  people groups. And by the way, you see the attack on Christ. The Antichrist spirit knows that.
[03:42:29.400 --> 03:42:33.400]  Don't hang up. Chris, I want you to finish up in William. We can go for 10 hours. Nick,
[03:42:33.400 --> 03:42:37.160]  you got to come back and take like two hours calls. And we'll do a commercial free podcast
[03:42:37.160 --> 03:42:41.000]  some Saturday. We'll open the phones up and take like 50 calls. We should do this. You got your

[03:43:57.400 --> 03:44:04.360]  In Arizona, I think we watched the election be stolen slowly stolen day by day counting these
[03:44:04.360 --> 03:44:10.840]  mail-in ballots. And it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously.
[03:44:10.840 --> 03:44:17.720]  When we just it's election month, Alex, it's not election day. And that's the problem. And
[03:44:17.720 --> 03:44:25.160]  everything changed after COVID-19. They illegally changed state elections, mailing ballots to anyone
[03:44:25.160 --> 03:44:30.360]  and everyone, and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people. Well, this isn't any way to
[03:44:30.360 --> 03:44:35.400]  run an election. We're in a serious country when we have elections that can be stolen like this.
[03:44:35.400 --> 03:44:40.840]  And I believe that just like I believe the election was stolen in 2020. And I have no problem
[03:44:40.840 --> 03:44:46.680]  saying that. And it's it is so absurd for the media and the Democrats to attack us that question
[03:44:46.680 --> 03:44:53.480]  our election integrity and question the the fact that elections shouldn't be run the way they are.
[03:44:53.480 --> 03:44:59.800]  We're not election deniers. We're election realists. I have an extremely important message to all of

[03:47:11.960 --> 03:47:21.640]  I'm an expert on how the globalists operate. Their main mechanism is helium dialectics.
[03:47:22.520 --> 03:47:25.720]  So they'll create multiple, sometimes two, three, four opposing forces
[03:47:27.160 --> 03:47:31.720]  and they'll run them together like waves in the water to create the storm they want.
[03:47:32.520 --> 03:47:36.280]  And so I love everybody, whether you're a Christian, Muslim, Jewish, old, young, black,
[03:47:36.280 --> 03:47:43.000]  white, it doesn't matter to me. As long as you support liberty and freedom. And there is a major
[03:47:43.000 --> 03:47:48.760]  battle in the Old Testament and the New Testament that the caller Chris was talking about in Kentucky,
[03:47:48.760 --> 03:47:53.720]  where God is telling the Jews, but also all of us, stop being evil or you'll go into bondage,
[03:47:53.720 --> 03:47:59.960]  stop doing this, stop doing that. And so I, that's the reality here for me. And that's what I'm
[03:47:59.960 --> 03:48:05.640]  trying to promote. Chris, finish your point please here with Nick Pointes. I guess probably the most
[03:48:05.640 --> 03:48:10.680]  important point I want to make was, you know, in the context of my daughter, she's a 14-year-old girl
[03:48:10.680 --> 03:48:16.840]  and she was sitting there listening to this conversation. And people need to realize, especially,
[03:48:16.840 --> 03:48:20.600]  you know, people like you, Nick, that have an influence over younger people,
[03:48:20.600 --> 03:48:25.240]  need to be very careful with their words, extremely careful. You don't realize what kind
[03:48:25.240 --> 03:48:31.720]  of influence you have. I think, honestly, this is my personal opinion, you do what you want to,
[03:48:31.720 --> 03:48:37.160]  but I think you need to read the Bible cover to cover two more times before you make any more
[03:48:37.160 --> 03:48:43.640]  comments about this subject. And I'll go back to kind of your back and forth between each other.
[03:48:44.200 --> 03:48:50.840]  You know, we try to pinpoint problems and find solutions. I think Alex has been pinpointing
[03:48:51.560 --> 03:49:01.240]  the exact problem on a growth on a man's big toe. And Nick, I think you're trying to cut the
[03:49:01.240 --> 03:49:08.200]  guy's whole leg off. And that's just the way I see, you know, what's happened here. But we need
[03:49:08.200 --> 03:49:12.440]  to be very careful with our words. Alright, thank you, Chris. I appreciate your call. God bless
[03:49:12.440 --> 03:49:19.320]  you for tuning in and spreading the word. Comments on that, Nick? I would just say that I just don't
[03:49:19.320 --> 03:49:24.440]  really... Number one, I am very precise with my words. If you watch my show, it's very precise
[03:49:24.440 --> 03:49:29.960]  and very nuanced. But look around you. The problem in this world, if you are a Christian,
[03:49:29.960 --> 03:49:36.040]  is not that you have guys like me being careless with words, which I'm not. The problem is that
[03:49:36.040 --> 03:49:41.080]  children are being exposed to pornography as young as nine years old. And their heads are
[03:49:41.080 --> 03:49:45.960]  being filled with all kinds of propaganda about violence and sex and sin. That's the problem.
[03:49:45.960 --> 03:49:51.320]  So I find it to be a little bit rich. And I'm going to be respectful. But Christians have
[03:49:51.320 --> 03:49:56.040]  got to toughen up. We're in a war here. Our adversary is the devil. And he's like a roaring
[03:49:56.040 --> 03:49:59.720]  lion looking for people to devour. And people are coming up against people like me who've
[03:49:59.720 --> 03:50:03.880]  given everything or other people like you and saying, you know, could you be a little bit
[03:50:03.880 --> 03:50:08.360]  more careful or something? It's like, you know, frankly, we're in a war. And that's not to say
[03:50:08.360 --> 03:50:12.520]  that we don't have responsibility. I take it seriously. I'm going to use my words precisely.
[03:50:12.520 --> 03:50:16.600]  All right, Nick, let's go to William in Colorado. Go ahead. You're on the air.
[03:50:18.280 --> 03:50:23.880]  Hey, guys. Alex and Nick, good job opening up this dialogue. And before I ask my question,
[03:50:23.880 --> 03:50:29.320]  I just want to say, you know, maybe it is time for, you know, the right conservatives to stop
[03:50:29.320 --> 03:50:35.160]  invoking Hitler and the left to always deflect the Hitler. But Alex, I got to ask, man,
[03:50:36.600 --> 03:50:40.680]  don't you agree that the Germans were fighting for a better future for all of Europe?
[03:50:41.800 --> 03:50:46.360]  In World War Two, I mean, aside from like the tactics of the war and Hitler,
[03:50:46.920 --> 03:50:50.600]  you keep repeating that you're German. Don't you think that Europe would be in a better place now?
[03:50:50.600 --> 03:50:56.280]  No, I did not say I'm German. I say I have German ancestors and Hitler got 20 million Germans killed.
[03:50:56.840 --> 03:50:58.440]  Well, that would make you German, sir.
[03:50:59.160 --> 03:51:03.480]  Well, what it makes me is I'm an American and a Christian, a Christian and then an American and
[03:51:03.480 --> 03:51:09.480]  a father. And I just think that I think Hitler was manipulated into that war. And I think Hitler
[03:51:09.480 --> 03:51:14.440]  did a lot of bad things. I don't think Hitler is the ultimate evil. I don't fetishize Hitler like
[03:51:14.440 --> 03:51:19.240]  the left does, but that's where I'm at. Well, you're already deflecting the question and going
[03:51:19.240 --> 03:51:23.320]  back to Hitler, I'm asking you, would it have all of Germany and all of Europe been better off?
[03:51:23.320 --> 03:51:26.920]  No, I don't think Europe would have been good under Hitler's European Union. And
[03:51:26.920 --> 03:51:31.240]  Edward VIII is the king of the EU. No, I don't think Hitler. Let me ask you a question.
[03:51:31.240 --> 03:51:37.320]  The first country Hitler invaded was Poland. They had a horseback military. He attacked them
[03:51:37.320 --> 03:51:42.600]  because they were weak. Why did Hitler attack and kill hundreds of thousands of Poles and bomb
[03:51:42.600 --> 03:51:51.800]  their major cities with stuka dive bombers and youngers? Why? Well, now you're getting into
[03:51:51.800 --> 03:51:55.480]  who fired the first shots of the war. World War II was more or less a rematch with World War I.
[03:51:55.480 --> 03:52:01.080]  We started, oh, you believe Operation Himmler at Gliwitz? You believe Poland attacked Germany?
[03:52:03.480 --> 03:52:06.920]  I believe that they both invaded the borders. As far as who fired the first shots,
[03:52:06.920 --> 03:52:10.600]  neither here nor there. I mean, I'm just asking you, you know, Europe
[03:52:10.600 --> 03:52:15.640]  would be better off now and for sure. I mean, actually, at Nuremberg, the Nazis testified
[03:52:15.640 --> 03:52:22.040]  that they staged an attack at Gliwitz on a German radio station, military station,
[03:52:22.040 --> 03:52:27.000]  and started the war. I appreciate your call. Nick, let me ask you that question. We're not,
[03:52:27.000 --> 03:52:31.800]  I know you don't defend Hitler here, but you think World War II, Hitler invading Poland,
[03:52:31.800 --> 03:52:36.120]  was that a good, did the Poles, are they the master group too? Do they deserve it?
[03:52:36.120 --> 03:52:43.640]  No, no, but I think you got to recognize the situation in Europe. And I would also say that
[03:52:43.640 --> 03:52:49.000]  the more relevant fact to me is the secret security guarantee that the British gave to
[03:52:49.000 --> 03:52:52.920]  Poland. I think that if you're looking for culpability for World War II, I don't think
[03:52:52.920 --> 03:52:57.240]  it rests with Hitler. I think it rests with, quite frankly, the United Kingdom and Winston
[03:52:57.240 --> 03:53:03.080]  Churchill. And you show your history knowledge and the Brits did not back up that security guarantee.
[03:53:03.080 --> 03:53:09.720]  Right. So, so in terms of, you know, in terms of those politics, I honestly don't think it's
[03:53:09.720 --> 03:53:14.280]  even relevant so much for today, because the thing is, we don't need to be having a big,
[03:53:14.280 --> 03:53:18.120]  protracted expert history discussion about World War II, the Holocaust. The question is,
[03:53:18.120 --> 03:53:23.160]  why is that the crux of the debate? And to me, that's the relevant part for Americans living
[03:53:23.160 --> 03:53:27.160]  in 2022, but they always want to get into the weeds on these things. No, no, I hear you. America
[03:53:27.160 --> 03:53:33.000]  wasn't Hitler. We didn't do that. So we should not be, have that by the left pushed on us. Let's
[03:53:33.000 --> 03:53:37.240]  talk to Craig in Washington. Go ahead. You're on the air with Nick Pointes. Oh, hey, guys. Hey,
[03:53:37.240 --> 03:53:42.440]  Nick, just a question for you. Like, like these are all just words and it's so silly that we're
[03:53:42.440 --> 03:53:47.080]  beating each other up. Why don't you start living in Christ? My question to you is like, why don't
[03:53:47.080 --> 03:53:52.440]  you, it doesn't have to be a horse driven. Why don't you become like the Amish do your own thing?
[03:53:52.440 --> 03:53:57.560]  Why don't, you know, for a group, you know, the Amish live in Christ more minutes of the day
[03:53:57.560 --> 03:54:03.160]  than probably any group out there. Why don't, why don't you just stop throwing bombs and start
[03:54:03.160 --> 03:54:10.120]  living in Christ? That's my question to you. Well, I don't know what that means. I'm not Amish.
[03:54:10.120 --> 03:54:14.520]  So I don't think living in Christ means living in a low tech society. I'm living in Christ every
[03:54:14.520 --> 03:54:18.920]  day. I'm a Christian. I go to church. I pray every day. I pray the rosary and what we're called to
[03:54:18.920 --> 03:54:24.360]  do, it's we're called to go out and evangelize and tell the truth. There's horrible iniquity
[03:54:24.360 --> 03:54:29.080]  and horrible injustice going on in the world. If you're a Christian, you have to be disgusted
[03:54:29.080 --> 03:54:33.720]  at the state of our country. Like I said, the filth in the media, the filth in our school system,
[03:54:33.720 --> 03:54:39.320]  the groomers, the porn, the media, it's terrible. And to sit by and watch all these innocent people
[03:54:39.320 --> 03:54:43.320]  and some kind of quietest, you know, people call this the Benedict option. I think it's a
[03:54:43.320 --> 03:54:50.360]  dereliction of duty. Let's talk to a wild in Wisconsin. Go ahead.
[03:54:52.600 --> 03:54:58.440]  Hi, Nick. I agree with you about like Jewish mafia stuff, but how you mentioned before
[03:54:58.440 --> 03:55:04.520]  about Hitler and being Christian, Hitler is known for also killing, you know, a significant portion
[03:55:04.520 --> 03:55:09.480]  of Orthodox Christians. I don't know really how you can square that. That's someone who's killed
[03:55:09.480 --> 03:55:15.960]  so many Christians and being a Christian is an idol of yours. And then also I was wondering if
[03:55:17.880 --> 03:55:23.000]  Kanye on the back of his jacket with the checkered flag, not the mask, but the jacket
[03:55:23.000 --> 03:55:29.480]  had a Masonic symbol on it, the checkerboard symbol, which is also the floor that Jesus was
[03:55:29.480 --> 03:55:35.160]  tried on with Pontius Pilate. Do you know if Kanye just likes racing or is he amazing?
[03:55:35.160 --> 03:55:39.960]  Well, first of all, it's yay. And no, I don't think that was the intention behind the jacket. He
[03:55:39.960 --> 03:55:46.360]  wanted to wear a motocross jacket. He said it fit the Texas, Austin, Info Wars. Yeah. He wanted
[03:55:46.360 --> 03:55:51.000]  he wanted to find a country. He wanted us to take him to a store at night to buy boots. They were
[03:55:51.000 --> 03:55:55.160]  close. So I can, he wanted a cowboy outfit. So he went with that. I can say that's true.
[03:55:56.120 --> 03:56:00.040]  Yeah. And what was the first question? The first question was about idolizing the thing is I
[03:56:00.040 --> 03:56:04.280]  don't idolize Hitler. And here's the problem. You bring up this conversation and people
[03:56:04.280 --> 03:56:08.280] 's brains turn off and they stop listening. I never said I idolize Hitler. I said,
[03:56:08.280 --> 03:56:11.960]  they're things I admire about Hitler. There's things I admire about Joseph Stalin. There's
[03:56:11.960 --> 03:56:15.960]  things I admire about Xi Jinping. As a Christian, you understand that we're all fallen. We're all
[03:56:15.960 --> 03:56:21.400]  sinners. And so there are no good and bad people. There are people that have good and bad actions.
[03:56:21.400 --> 03:56:27.240]  And, and I would be, you know, I think the scientists are good too. Like I said, I love
[03:56:27.240 --> 03:56:31.960]  everybody. Ben Shapiro, I think he has good attributes. Dennis Prager, you know, he says
[03:56:31.960 --> 03:56:38.280]  that I don't go to hell. We're out of time. We're out of time. Amazing debate and interview.
[03:56:38.280 --> 03:56:42.040]  Sorry to the other callers. Nick, join us again for another one of these. Let's do a commercial
[03:56:42.040 --> 03:56:47.240]  free soon. Okay. Let's do it. Yeah. Thanks for having me on. And what is it? Cozy dot

[03:58:50.360 --> 03:58:53.800]  And that's because it's been denatured. It's been worked out. We didn't do that.
[03:58:55.320 --> 03:58:59.800]  You think I would metaphysically tell you something. This is the very best I can get.
[03:58:59.800 --> 03:59:06.440]  I'd rather go to hell and do that. I will only give you the maximum best info, the maximum truth,
[03:59:06.440 --> 03:59:13.480]  the maximum product because I want that good will. What I do to you, I do to myself. Don't you get the
[03:59:13.480 --> 03:59:19.800]  big secret? You ever seen fish oil look like that? No, you never seen that have you. And this little
[03:59:19.800 --> 03:59:35.000]  jewel right here is solid liquid consciousness. Look it up. Find out how even the FDA and the
[03:59:35.000 --> 03:59:39.000]  government admits fish oil is incredible. The number one thing anybody can do for themselves
[03:59:39.720 --> 03:59:44.760]  is take good fish oil or krill oil. Just like our information is dynamite. So are our products in
[03:59:44.760 --> 04:00:06.120]  force.com. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
