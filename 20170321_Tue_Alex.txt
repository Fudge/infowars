[00:00.000 --> 00:05.280]  This program contains language and sequences some viewers may find disturbing
[00:06.840 --> 00:13.440]  The nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread and the military apparatus of this country is about to be handed over to Scum
[00:13.720 --> 00:17.360]  We're beholden to Scum and the Russian name is Scum
[00:17.360 --> 00:28.040]  Listen please listen if you don't if you won't
[00:28.040 --> 00:34.360]  If you fail to understand and the same incredible terror that's menacing me will strike in you
[00:34.360 --> 00:37.360]  The function of all life is survival
[00:37.360 --> 00:43.360]  Sleep, sleep, sleep
[00:43.360 --> 00:53.360]  We're coming, we're coming, help, help, they're coming, they're coming listen to me
[00:53.360 --> 00:58.360]  Listen, help me, your next please, please, your next they're in danger
[00:58.360 --> 01:01.360]  Please listen to me, it's something terrible
[01:01.360 --> 01:08.360]  Your next you're the end, they're already here, help, your next, they're coming, they're coming
[01:08.360 --> 01:14.360]  The seed is planted, sleep, terror grows
[01:14.360 --> 01:19.360]  Elizabeth, wake up, I'll get you when you sleep, sit up
[01:19.360 --> 01:22.360]  Invasion of the body snatchers
[01:22.360 --> 01:26.360]  All of a sudden they're growing like parasites, is it contagious?
[01:26.360 --> 01:30.360]  It looks right at me, you need to get out
[01:30.360 --> 01:33.360]  I'm looking at it as if it was human, I'm not human
[01:33.360 --> 01:38.360]  Now the classic fear begins to grow
[01:38.360 --> 01:40.360]  We're being cornered
[01:40.360 --> 01:43.360]  In a modern masterpiece of science fiction
[01:43.360 --> 01:45.360]  I'm barricading the street
[01:45.360 --> 01:49.360]  Invasion of the body snatchers
[01:49.360 --> 02:04.360]  The land of the walking dead
[02:10.360 --> 02:15.360]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance
[02:15.360 --> 02:21.360]  It's Alice Jones
[02:21.360 --> 02:28.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live worldwide broadcast today
[02:28.360 --> 02:37.360]  That's a powerful piece that Darren McBreen put together, paralleling science fiction nightmares of dystopian alien takeovers
[02:37.360 --> 02:47.360]  With zombified, hive-like populations, and you see what's actually happening to those that are succumbing to the modern globalist brainwashing and propaganda
[02:47.360 --> 02:50.360]  That is as advanced as any off-world alien invasion
[02:50.360 --> 02:57.360]  And you see that we're living in the middle of what is a battle for a future for humanity or a dystopian nightmare
[02:57.360 --> 03:07.360]  When we come back to the next segment, I have figured out exactly what they're doing
[03:07.360 --> 03:23.360]  In fact, beyond that, I have gone and dug into their own policy papers and confirmed that they have decided at least three months ago when President Trump won the election
[03:23.360 --> 03:33.360]  To claim that he's an outside Russian force and that anyone supporting him is and actually direct the bureaucracies of the government outside of the executive in open mutiny and rebellion
[03:33.360 --> 03:43.360]  To build in a soft coup civil war towards a physical one. They are intending to overthrow the president one way or another
[03:43.360 --> 03:49.360]  They are intending to politically persecute those of us that have been trying to defend the country. The globalists are here
[03:49.360 --> 03:57.360]  And they've actually declared their plans. They are the outside globalist force alien to this republic
[03:57.360 --> 04:03.360]  And just as dangerous as any sci-fi nightmare that the human mind can conjure
[04:03.360 --> 04:13.360]  Because the same human minds that can conjure nightmares can also build real nightmares on this planet when grips of psychopaths and sociopaths get together
[04:13.360 --> 04:21.360]  But the headline today on the live feed at infowars.com for my show and on many other platforms is
[04:21.360 --> 04:32.360]  Obama planned to take over the internet and talk radio and shut down free speech is still in place and they're still moving forward with it
[04:32.360 --> 04:41.360]  Now I knew this months ago and I was surmising that but I knew it was bold. It's definite now they have announced it in their own councils of government
[04:41.360 --> 04:48.360]  These are rogue agencies. This is truly the rogue deep state
[04:48.360 --> 04:56.360]  A group who's sworn to break our back and complete our journey to slavery. The good news is no matter what they do now they're going to lose
[04:56.360 --> 05:12.360]  The question is how ruffle again.
[05:26.360 --> 05:34.360]  They ignore federal immigration law indicating nearly 200 illegal immigrants sought for deportation were released instead
[05:34.360 --> 05:43.360]  The name and shame list was ordered released by President Donald Trump when he signed two executive orders related to immigration in January
[05:43.360 --> 05:52.360]  In response to a number of local jurisdictions that have refused to cooperate with immigration and customs enforcement as self declared quote
[05:52.360 --> 05:59.360]  We're going to be back in January cities. Stay tuned for more immigration news at infowars.com slash show
[05:59.360 --> 06:08.360]  Today we call it bone broth and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern diet of processed junk
[06:08.360 --> 06:19.360]  We are now introducing caveman by infowarslife.com the ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, shaga mushroom and seven total primal super foods
[06:19.360 --> 06:26.360]  Great tasting formula caveman is those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors
[06:26.360 --> 06:34.360]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal you use the meat for sustenance the fat for cooking
[06:34.360 --> 06:42.360]  But you use the bones for strength from the outside structure full of minerals and Kiko factors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body
[06:42.360 --> 06:52.360]  This is the engine of the life essence. I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were
[06:52.360 --> 06:58.360]  And this is a big part of it. I know you're going to want to check out caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself in infowarslife.com today

[08:18.360 --> 08:26.360]  You will come to the island without name, the longing for the sun
[08:26.360 --> 08:33.360]  Be welcome on the island many miles away from home
[08:33.360 --> 08:41.360]  Be welcome on the island without name, the longing for the sun
[08:41.360 --> 08:54.360]  Be welcome on the island many miles away from home
[08:54.360 --> 09:12.360]  be welcome on the island
[09:12.360 --> 09:32.360]  Be welcome on the island many miles away from home
[09:32.360 --> 09:52.360]  Be welcome on the island many miles away from home
[09:52.360 --> 10:12.360]  Be welcome on the island many miles away from home
[10:12.360 --> 10:40.360]  Be welcome on the island many miles away from home
[10:40.360 --> 10:46.360]  It's undisputed that cash flowed to the Clinton Foundation from the Russians $35 million
[10:46.360 --> 10:53.360]  It's undisputed even the precious New York Times admits that so what's the big story here
[10:53.360 --> 11:06.360]  They have had the Board of Governors of the FCC officially come out in Senate Intelligence Committee meetings on C-SPAN
[11:06.360 --> 11:16.360]  And say that I'm a Russian stooge that regurgitates Russian propaganda
[11:16.360 --> 11:23.360]  So the way around, I'm Americana and want a free market system and my ideas are getting picked up
[11:23.360 --> 11:27.360]  Which are just Americana ideas that we're bringing back and making great again
[11:27.360 --> 11:33.360]  All over the world 15 years ago Nigel Farage said that half the people they had joining UKIP
[11:33.360 --> 11:38.360]  And the reason they were exploding was that my broadcast was the number one internet radio show
[11:38.360 --> 11:46.360]  That's how they picked it up there, according to Alexa.com, Quantcast, all of them
[11:46.360 --> 11:51.360]  Was that a Russian movement? No, that was Americana
[11:51.360 --> 11:55.360]  America was always sexy the whole world until we became socialists and globalists
[11:55.360 --> 12:00.360]  The world was always adopting our great ideas, I was just bringing them back
[12:00.360 --> 12:12.360]  So in France, in Germany, in Sweden, in Brazil, in Japan, all over they will tell you Alex Jones
[12:12.360 --> 12:18.360]  And I'm not here about taking credit, there really wasn't anybody who was even half young
[12:18.360 --> 12:22.360]  Who wasn't 80 years old that was exposing this stuff
[12:22.360 --> 12:29.360]  And I did it a 21st century way, before the 21st century
[12:29.360 --> 12:34.360]  I'm huge in Russia, I've never been to Russia
[12:34.360 --> 12:38.360]  I've been huge on Russian TV for 15 years playing clips on my show
[12:38.360 --> 12:44.360]  I've been huge all over the Middle East
[12:44.360 --> 12:48.360]  Even though I bashed radical Islam, most of the Muslims don't want to live under it
[12:48.360 --> 12:52.360]  Max Kaiser goes to the Middle East, live in Cairo, it's being mobbed
[12:52.360 --> 12:56.360]  Alex Jones, Alex Jones, we love, is it Alex Jones? Is it Alex Jones?
[12:56.360 --> 13:02.360]  And I'm not bragging about info wars, just to understand, we are the info war
[13:02.360 --> 13:10.360]  We are 1776, we're Americana, we're what the image of John Wayne was supposed to be
[13:10.360 --> 13:15.360]  And I love John Wayne, great patriot, the point is, we're doing it
[13:15.360 --> 13:21.360]  And the globalists of the traders, they're the outside group that has come in and taken over the country
[13:21.360 --> 13:27.360]  And here we are, not just in the United States, but worldwide saying, kick the oligarchs out, kick the globalists down
[13:27.360 --> 13:31.360]  Don't let the IMF, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization, the TPP
[13:31.360 --> 13:35.360]  And all these deals, transfer your sovereignty out of the country
[13:35.360 --> 13:40.360]  Remember Lou Dobbs popularizing it massively 10 years ago
[13:40.360 --> 13:46.360]  Having the number one show on cable for two years, even above Bill O'Reilly, CNN's only hit show
[13:46.360 --> 13:49.360]  What did they do? They fired him
[13:49.360 --> 13:55.360]  Lou Dobbs, was that like seven, eight years ago?
[13:55.360 --> 13:59.360]  It's not about credit, it's about knowing the history
[13:59.360 --> 14:04.360]  Drudge to report blue holes in globalism, Lou Dobbs blue holes in globalism
[14:04.360 --> 14:07.360]  Dr. Corsi blue holes in it, World Bank Daily did a great job
[14:07.360 --> 14:14.360]  We all did this together, you did this, you exposed it at the town halls, you spoke out
[14:14.360 --> 14:22.360]  And to claim it's Russian is the most ridiculous thing on earth
[14:22.360 --> 14:29.360]  But they don't care, the rogue government admittedly is ignoring Trump in the State Department, in the VA, everywhere
[14:29.360 --> 14:38.360]  These are the criminals that have seized control of our country and that are robbing it and that are looting it as fast as they can
[14:38.360 --> 14:46.360]  And what do they do when real nationalists, real patriots come out that actually want to get control of their government again
[14:46.360 --> 14:52.360]  And put us back on the course that made the country great, getting small business loans with almost zero percent interest
[14:52.360 --> 15:01.360]  Cutting taxes, economic development zones, promoting the family, getting the morale up of the nation, not being demoralized
[15:01.360 --> 15:11.360]  That's 180 degrees from the globalist plan of ploward and pithon and scarcity and artificial scarcity and planned obsolescence
[15:11.360 --> 15:15.360]  And all this deindustrialization, the post-industrial world, Gen 21
[15:15.360 --> 15:21.360]  And they play these stonewall games, all these terms like Gen 21 and others, but people know it's real, it's happening
[15:21.360 --> 15:28.360]  So our victory is we've forced this out in the open and you could really say that even according to their own publications
[15:28.360 --> 15:37.360]  By March of 2017, globalism is dead, it's collapsing, the tide is going out on it, to quote Peter Thiel, the elites all admit it in their own publications
[15:37.360 --> 15:45.360]  So they've gone from denying all this exists to saying, okay, it exists, but the Russians are the ones destroying it
[15:45.360 --> 15:52.360]  So the board of governors castified to Congress last week and then they had synopses with the FBI director yesterday
[15:52.360 --> 15:58.360]  And we're going to play some of these clips, I'm going to skip this break, now there's a Lennon Guardian
[15:58.360 --> 16:01.360]  It's too late for hand-wringing, globalism is already dead, that's right
[16:01.360 --> 16:11.360]  Once it's discovered to be elite, unelected, above the law, tax-exempt, diplomatically immune, totally corrupt, the new royalty, we reject Kim Jong-un
[16:11.360 --> 16:17.360]  We reject Queen Elizabeth II, we reject George Soros and the new royalty at the UN
[16:17.360 --> 16:28.360]  We're done, and isn't it a bellwether, an omen that the father of modern globalism, the father of modern imperial corporate colonialism
[16:28.360 --> 16:36.360]  Died two days ago, David Rockefeller, the one who praised Mao Zedong's murder factory
[16:36.360 --> 16:45.360]  So let me give you the big breakdown, we've now confirmed it from their own words, all of it indexed together, right now you're about to get the data done
[16:45.360 --> 17:01.360]  Not just what they're saying, and not just what they're currently doing, but what the next phases are in their attack profile against our attempt to restore the Republic
[17:01.360 --> 17:05.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, here are the McClatchy and other headlines
[17:05.360 --> 17:18.360]  Mike Bart at M4's under investigation for ties to Russia, they specifically say, for working with Russian intelligence, they have gone so far at the FBI using the analysis of the Board of Governors
[17:18.360 --> 17:22.360]  Broadcasting, which is the CIA, I'm going to show you in a moment
[17:22.360 --> 17:42.360]  So rogue elements of the CIA are now declaring that the President's chief advisor, that the biggest independent media talk show host, Alex Jones, and others are Russian combines and actively working with the Russians, coordinating with them
[17:42.360 --> 17:46.360]  Unbelievable
[17:46.360 --> 17:57.360]  And of course, zero evidence is given, but this is just amazing, then you realize that Podesta and all of them got caught with Google, Facebook, Twitter, coordinating in the WikiLeaks, how to steal the election, how to have bots
[17:57.360 --> 18:07.360]  And they've got Don and Brazil in these articles going, it's horrible, we never used bots or did anything corrupt and in full versus with the Russians, and they have Podesta and they're saying that too
[18:07.360 --> 18:20.360]  Oh my gosh, you just ran all the big media and coordinated with the headlines at the New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, MSNBC, everywhere else, you just put lies out about everybody and now the meanie Russians got you
[18:20.360 --> 18:32.360]  And so you're asking, the Board of Governors, people are asking, well, how are they going to shut down info wars, if Trump's in, they're intending to overthrow Trump, they've already said they are
[18:32.360 --> 18:39.360]  They're already probing how to kill him right now, we are in a true hot civil war now, we're not in a cold one
[18:39.360 --> 18:52.360]  We're winning the info war, they've decided they're going to declare Trump a Russian agent, and the brains of the American resistance that are so red, white and blue, it's ridiculous, we're on fire with Americana
[18:52.360 --> 19:02.360]  We are the heart of 1776, and they're completely horrified by it, and they have the nerve, it's beyond outrage I have, the despicableness
[19:02.360 --> 19:18.360]  When they're the globalists that infiltrated, they're trying to make our country poor, trying to destroy our sovereignty, they have our borders wide open, with hundreds of sanctuary cities ignoring the law, treating our veterans like total crap, looting social security, trying to block Trump's plan to save it
[19:18.360 --> 19:25.360]  And of course they invert reality, they're the traders, they're the outsiders, they're the enemies, they're the globalists
[19:25.360 --> 19:36.360]  So in their publications where they read it, foreign affairs in the financial times are like, our global government's collapsing, we've got to use cultural and racial strife to control them
[19:36.360 --> 19:43.360]  They all talk in these publications that are public, like you're idiots and don't read it, I do, I show you there's quotes on air
[19:43.360 --> 19:53.360]  But for general consumption it's just dumbed down showing they're disdain, that Trump's a Russian, oh you didn't elect Trump, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[19:53.360 --> 19:57.360]  The Russians want to make America great again
[19:57.360 --> 20:08.360]  Oh and look, Alex Jones has gone on Russian TV shows, absolutely and promoted that they need to have a free country as well, and I go on Japanese and British and Mexican and everything else
[20:08.360 --> 20:18.360]  So again, Breitbart at M4s under investigation retires the Russia report, the FBI's Russia influence probe, they close a look at far right news sites
[20:18.360 --> 20:30.360]  Then they mix in, oh it's fake, and then they go on and they say this, we're going to look at banning it and moving, and that's in the bill that Obama signed
[20:30.360 --> 20:47.360]  S2943 in the $611 billion 2017 Defense Authorization Act and the NDAA, remember that's the one earlier when Obama signed where he could just disappear US citizens
[20:47.360 --> 20:57.360]  So they have a stay behind shadow deep state government that's just completely ignoring the president, bullying Congress and everybody else, you better get in line because we're taking Trump out
[20:57.360 --> 21:03.360]  I said that two months ago in December, it's three months ago now, and you can now see it all crystallizing
[21:03.360 --> 21:09.360]  The president just thinks he can work with people, create prosperity and that somehow he'll convince everybody to stop doing this
[21:09.360 --> 21:16.360]  These are people that had hijacked America, they have a disdain for it, they're on recording saying they're going to break our will of the bitter clingers
[21:16.360 --> 21:31.360]  They're in public statements saying they want to mount our heads on the wall, they want to dominate us as an act of will, like Captain Ahab and Moby Dick in legend, in fiction
[21:31.360 --> 21:41.360]  You understand? They don't like us because we're honorable and good, these are degenerate scumbags, read the WikiLeaks, read the evil
[21:41.360 --> 21:55.360]  So go read the Obama quietly signs the countering disinformation and propaganda act, he signed it into law, it's still operating and it says the CIA will confirm with the board of governors of the FCC
[21:55.360 --> 22:10.360]  The countering information warfare act, S2692, introduced in March, passed, and it says they're going to ban fake news and move to block it in the United States
[22:10.360 --> 22:17.360]  And to create a whole government strategy for countering the foreign propaganda that operates through the domestic fake news
[22:17.360 --> 22:30.360]  Yeah, the fake news is actually reading the bills here. Now, I'm going to play this clip of them last week talking about yours truly and mixing it in with RT and Sputnik and these other channels
[22:30.360 --> 22:36.360]  By the way, half of what I see on RT is a bunch of leftist crud
[22:36.360 --> 22:47.360]  U.S. repeals propaganda ban spreads government made news to Americans, that's foreign policy, three years ago, the Washington Post admitting the CIA is going to operate domestically
[22:47.360 --> 22:52.360]  They already were, but they admit they're going to lie to the public with this new strategy to ban fake news
[22:52.360 --> 23:00.360]  Three years later, they intend to get Hillary in and then have her lead the charge, but she didn't get in, they're just acting like they're going to remove Trump regardless, here's another one
[23:00.360 --> 23:06.360]  Business Insider, U.S. government funded domestic propaganda has officially hit the airwaves
[23:06.360 --> 23:16.360]  Washington Post amends Russian propaganda fake news story admits it's fake, listing us as fake, but see now they can't get the Washington Post to put their name on it
[23:16.360 --> 23:20.360]  So now what are they doing?
[23:20.360 --> 23:36.360]  Now they're just going to have Congress do it and say they're going to have the FBI counter espionage group do it like they had during the Red Scare that was the Democrats who a lot of them really were card-carrying communists and were giving secrets away and things
[23:36.360 --> 23:42.360]  Like the Rosenbergs, but this time what great revenge they're going after
[23:42.360 --> 23:53.360]  Basically the sons of John Wayne, people that are doing the exact same things John Wayne did in his anti-communist speeches and saying we're the Russian Stooges
[23:53.360 --> 24:00.360]  Because we're not enemies with Russia because they pulled out of that whole system, but we've got our own country, we want nationalism
[24:00.360 --> 24:22.360]  I'm going to go over all of this, but I wanted to play you a clip because when you read who is this individual that they have on C-SPAN talking to the House Armed Services Committee and also the intelligence community this week
[24:22.360 --> 24:31.360]  Matthew Armstrong, associate fellow Center for Strategic Communication, but that King's College, but that's not really what he is
[24:31.360 --> 24:44.360]  He's a governor of the, he is a governor on the Broadcasting Board of Governors
[24:44.360 --> 24:55.360]  And when you read the legislation that Obama signed into law right before he left and you say well why doesn't Trump just kill this, they don't care, they don't follow his orders
[24:55.360 --> 25:01.360]  They just do whatever they want and continue moving forward
[25:01.360 --> 25:16.360]  And it goes on to say that the Board of Governors in concert with the Central Intelligence Agency will coordinate a whole government first priority program to counter the foreign propaganda disinformation
[25:16.360 --> 25:29.360]  And the war against us and our allies by our enemies and goes on to list fake news or domestic news and uses the Washington Post own fake article as the roadmap
[25:29.360 --> 25:38.360]  So they all just make up lies and then vomit them back on to each other and then vomit them back on to each other in a giant circular motion
[25:38.360 --> 25:50.360]  So imagine this, they are now openly saying, by the way I had family yesterday when I told them about this, I said yeah I've officially been listed as under investigation by the FBI for actually working with Russian intelligence
[25:50.360 --> 26:00.360]  And they said come on that's not true, I said no it's real, then I told a fellow I know who's worked in a lot of places including the CIA about it
[26:00.360 --> 26:10.360]  And he said that's crazy, I'm going to make some phone calls, you know where did that come from, I'm going to call and double check those, I said it came out of Comey's mouth
[26:10.360 --> 26:21.360]  That's how incredible this is ladies and gentlemen, but you're saying no one will believe it, this doesn't make sense, there's no proof, they don't care
[26:21.360 --> 26:29.360]  They already killed a lot of people, they've already tried to kill Roger Stone with Polonium and all the rest of it, they tried to hit and run him last week
[26:29.360 --> 26:36.360]  And they keep saying they're going to call him to the Senate committee hearings but now they're going to have hearings, they've had hearings but he doesn't get to be there, he just gets accused
[26:36.360 --> 26:41.360]  That's never before been done in American history
[26:41.360 --> 26:48.360]  So I demand if they have more hearings and talk about me, I demand that I be able to be there
[26:48.360 --> 26:56.360]  And I'm going to be there with a big stack of news going here you are admitting fake news, here you are admitting that the Senate Intelligence Committee was talking about the CIA with illegal spying
[26:56.360 --> 27:07.360]  Here you are saying you're going to target domestic media you don't like claiming the Russian spies and now you're doing it months later, why on earth is this legislation that Obama signed still in place, President Trump needs to kill it
[27:07.360 --> 27:16.360]  You're not going to put me in front of that committee because my truth and my facts and my evidence will destroy these little cowards
[27:16.360 --> 27:26.360]  I tell you, they just sit there, they have Alec Baldwin get up on TV and poses Trump and say racist things and say he learned it from Alec Jones
[27:26.360 --> 27:34.360]  Just like all these other movies and TV shows they've got out saying the same thing where some character says horrible racist stuff and they say where'd you learn that, I learned it from Alec Jones
[27:34.360 --> 27:47.360]  This is the lying info war by criminals that have hijacked our government that are at war with our republic and people desperately trying to get control of the wheel to right the ship
[27:47.360 --> 28:01.360]  And you can see just a ray of sunshine into this country, the globalists want us poor and controlled, just the idea that maybe we're open for business again, 3 trillion in the stock market, massive new job hiring, wages going up, restaurants busy again
[28:01.360 --> 28:10.360]  Act 3 is opening all over the place, optimism the highest it's been since 1984
[28:10.360 --> 28:16.360]  So the big question is how do we counter this, how do we respond to this
[28:16.360 --> 28:22.360]  When we come back I'm going to play the clip of Armstrong
[28:22.360 --> 28:39.360]  Governor on the Broadcasting Board of Governors until last year 2013-2016 advising Obama, so you can bet money he had a hand in writing the bill that Obama signed
[28:39.360 --> 28:54.360]  In the Defense Authorization Act to have the CIA go after the independent media and guess what they do a couple months later by name yours truly, ladies and gentlemen, they mean business
[28:54.360 --> 29:02.360]  They've been incrementally adding more lies every day, it had been absurd to say we're all Russian agents 3 months ago right, with no proof
[29:02.360 --> 29:12.360]  They just keep recycling the same lies that get disproven, no Russian connection, no hacking, no nothing, oh my gosh, you know, Roger Stone tried to talk to WikiLeaks
[29:12.360 --> 29:16.360]  So did CNN, so did everybody else, of course we're trying to get the leaks, I don't care where they come from
[29:16.360 --> 29:22.360]  And they turned that around all their crimes and the fact that they lost the election and the fact that they rigged everything
[29:22.360 --> 29:32.360]  And the fact that they got caught rigging stuff with CNN and rigging the debates and then now Dona Brazil, the disgraced Dona Brazil interviews Brian Williams who's back, another disgraced fake
[29:32.360 --> 29:44.360]  To tell everybody about how she was the target of the Russians and of course Maxine Waters says she's the target and then Maxine Waters doesn't know what planet she's on saying Russia invaded Korea
[29:44.360 --> 29:48.360]  I mean this is crazy but it's also hilarious
[29:48.360 --> 29:52.360]  We're on the march, the empires are on the march folks
[29:52.360 --> 30:18.360]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[30:18.360 --> 30:22.360]  Clifford Cunningham has this report on Infowars.com
[30:48.360 --> 31:04.360]  It's not just our water we need to filter, it's not just our food that needs to be cleaned, it's the air we're breathing
[31:04.360 --> 31:18.360]  Especially for our children, the artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems. The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems
[31:18.360 --> 31:28.360]  Have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze, whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job you can to purify your air
[31:28.360 --> 31:36.360]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves
[31:36.360 --> 31:38.360]  The general public doesn't
[31:38.360 --> 31:42.360]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500
[31:42.360 --> 31:46.360]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean
[31:46.360 --> 31:52.360]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job
[31:52.360 --> 31:58.360]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfowarsStore.com
[32:22.360 --> 32:29.360]  People living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors and we need to do everything we can to recapture them
[32:29.360 --> 32:37.360]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal, you used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength
[32:37.360 --> 32:45.360]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence
[32:45.360 --> 32:53.360]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were and this is a big part of it
[32:53.360 --> 33:22.360]  I know you're going to want to check out caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself at InfowarsLife.com today.
[33:22.360 --> 33:32.360]  I told everybody 22 years ago when I first went on air that I'd sworn on the ultra of God, eternal resistance over every form of tyranny over the mind of man
[33:32.360 --> 33:48.360]  And I've prayed almost every day that God give me the will, the strength, the understanding, the honor to change the world and take on the globalist and those that are engaged in so many heinous crimes consciously against humanity
[33:48.360 --> 34:02.360]  Murder one premeditated conspiracy to destroy the human system that is the globalist devilish program and I got to tell you I have seen God deliver in spades
[34:02.360 --> 34:22.360]  But always in my soul I could feel the Holy Spirit saying but you will pay for this and I've always said that's exactly what I'm ready to do not out of self loving or wanting to be a martyr but because I understand that I have to sacrifice everything
[34:22.360 --> 34:42.360]  And you have to sacrifice as well if we're going to reverse this evil tide God works through people and I just was thinking this morning it was mind blowing just how wicked the social engineers are and how they are at war with humanity
[34:42.360 --> 34:57.360]  And how they are attempting to build false artificial constructs full spectrum grids of lies that they then put people into artificially who are inside the mainstream media bubble
[34:57.360 --> 35:10.360]  It's beyond an echo chamber and truly we're telling hardcore truth with some distortion because there's no way to see things perfectly and they're telling hardcore total lies
[35:10.360 --> 35:15.360]  They're the foreign multinational globalist killing our sovereignty and freedom taking over
[35:15.360 --> 35:20.360]  They say we're Russian agents because we're real Americans fighting back and now
[35:20.360 --> 35:25.360]  Breitbarton info wars under investigation for ties to Russia report
[35:25.360 --> 35:41.360]  Last week and this week in armed service and intelligence committee hearings they have board of governors of the broadcasting board of the FCC now under the central intelligence agency
[35:41.360 --> 35:48.360]  As of two weeks before Obama left office Obama quietly signed into law
[35:48.360 --> 35:56.360]  2017 it's just unbelievable and in the Senate
[35:56.360 --> 36:06.360]  S2692 that says the CIA will be over the board of governors and will take on domestic media that they claim are working with the Russians
[36:06.360 --> 36:15.360]  We'll see then they've got them claim you're working with the Russians with no proof to claim you're a foreign power
[36:15.360 --> 36:23.360]  Then you're an enemy combatant under a previous NDAA in National Defense Authorization Act
[36:23.360 --> 36:34.360]  And I told you this was all coming that they would start incrementally selling the idea that there were Ruskies everywhere
[36:34.360 --> 36:40.360]  To the point of I have media calling here saying oh you've been on Russian TV it doesn't a Russian work there
[36:40.360 --> 36:49.360]  There's nobody who was born in Russia that's the level that this country has fallen to
[36:49.360 --> 37:03.360]  And what's crazy is it's the Democrats that literally worked with the Russians from 1917 on it was liberals in New York and in London that who'd been Russian immigrants
[37:03.360 --> 37:11.360]  They went back to Russia and overthrew Russia that's why there was such ties from the beginning
[37:11.360 --> 37:25.360]  Russia and the Soviets all of it was a liberal creation in America and in England that's historical facts and the Trotskyites
[37:25.360 --> 37:41.360]  Now isn't that incredible and then they turn around to people like myself that have a sickening American pedigree
[37:41.360 --> 37:47.360]  I mean it doesn't get more ridiculous
[37:47.360 --> 37:52.360]  I mean if you did my Americana pedigree I might win Best in Show if they had such silly things
[37:52.360 --> 37:59.360]  But I don't get into all that because what I do in this life I'm a live counselor not what my ancestors did though I love them
[37:59.360 --> 38:04.360]  And they're with me now in spirit and in blood
[38:04.360 --> 38:13.360]  But it's like saying George Washington or Thomas Jefferson or Andrew Jackson is a foreign enemy
[38:13.360 --> 38:17.360]  But you see they have a dumbed down public but they're not even doing an info war with the public now
[38:17.360 --> 38:22.360]  They only need the cover in government as an excuse to tell agencies they're going rogue
[38:22.360 --> 38:31.360]  And I first said this in December in an emergency warning to the president I said they're selling this narrative under COG to have a breakaway deep state scenario
[38:31.360 --> 38:38.360]  To try to block you at every level and then finally assassinate you or impeach you but they know you're too strong being able to speak Mr. President
[38:38.360 --> 38:43.360]  So before they finally move they're going to kill you
[38:43.360 --> 38:53.360]  And I told Stone privately I said before they ever call you before the senate when they start beating this drum they're going to try to kill you and indeed that happened
[38:53.360 --> 39:10.360]  There's a good chance they'll kill him before they're even forced to call him or they may just not call him and just tell all the media you're not going to have Stone on he can't even respond
[39:10.360 --> 39:21.360]  So that's the level and remember they're coming for your guns they're coming for your children they've got your children the public schools brainwashing them
[39:21.360 --> 39:26.360]  Dumming the public down
[39:26.360 --> 39:33.360]  They've got the veterans under their VA with their death panels not giving them treatment and letting them die they'd almost won
[39:33.360 --> 39:44.360]  They've got the Glyphosates in your water table they're getting away with all of it they've got the MTV admittedly targeting and sexualizing children as young as five basically pedophile programming
[39:44.360 --> 39:55.360]  We're under massive social engineering America was being turned into a giant reeducation camp and they were going to drop the hammer when Hillary got in and shut down the alternative news the independent news calling it fake news
[39:55.360 --> 40:05.360]  That was all admitted they were in the news saying when Hillary gets elected in two weeks we're going to start shutting Alex Jones and others down and we're going to sue him and we're going to have the justice department come after him
[40:05.360 --> 40:19.360]  And get this folks they could shut us down your next but see Trump got in they didn't get to have what they wanted and so now they are bleeding from the eyeballs politically they don't know what to do for
[40:19.360 --> 40:28.360]  Read Zarkaria screaming and yelling and cussing fits on TV because they know their whole criminal enterprise is coming down and they are a society of scum
[40:28.360 --> 40:39.360]  That's why they all look so ugly and look so evil they don't just do bad things they're hateful because they're physically and spiritually ugly
[40:39.360 --> 40:57.360]  They're horrible horrible horrible horrible weak people and they see you who love freedom and who want a future and who aren't a psychopath or sociopath and they want to dominate you because they know you're better than them
[40:57.360 --> 41:09.360]  That's what this is all about Mr. President I know you're wholesome and good I know you're strong I know you want to see prosperity I know you want to beat these bullies
[41:09.360 --> 41:16.360]  I know you're sick of watching America and other groups being screwed over by elites and you want to empower the people and they're never going to stop coming after you sir
[41:16.360 --> 41:32.360]  You can't ever back off of them you can't take the high road don't listen to those advisors mark my words they're going to undermine you and claim you're a Russian agent and they're never going to stop and they're going to try to assassinate you
[41:32.360 --> 41:40.360]  But first they've got to assassinate your name so you're not looking to be on the offense but you've got to be because this is an outside enemy force
[41:40.360 --> 41:47.360]  People don't know what I tell Trump that's what I tell him every time I talk to him
[41:47.360 --> 41:51.360]  Trump says I'm one of the only people he talks to who's never asked for anything I don't ask him to come on the show
[41:51.360 --> 41:59.360]  What you don't want me to come on the show? Sure don't even worry about that you worry about your life and you worry about identifying these people as the enemy
[41:59.360 --> 42:01.360]  He knows it
[42:01.360 --> 42:14.360]  Good luck globalist you may destroy me you may destroy Trump but I know in my heart at an intellectual level but at a spiritual level God's hands on my shoulder saying good
[42:14.360 --> 42:19.360]  Faithfully execute this and they will be defeated and that's all that matters
[42:19.360 --> 42:33.360]  They're going to execute on you no matter what you do and we're never going to stop and God is going to break you Podesta God is going to break you Hilary Faridzarkaria, Michael Moore, David Rockefeller
[42:33.360 --> 42:36.360]  Yes already God just broke you
[42:36.360 --> 42:39.360]  You just like the rest of us now aren't you? God man
[42:39.360 --> 42:41.360]  Uber mentioned
[42:41.360 --> 42:43.360]  Your whole Hitler project
[42:43.360 --> 42:50.360]  Your UN project your global project will all burn in the end
[42:50.360 --> 43:08.360]  And the rivers of blood you've spilled out of the innocent will be the sea that your soul drowns in in the rotting bottomless pit forever
[43:08.360 --> 43:17.360]  That no mistake they're coming for us all. They already come for the kids with the shots and the cancer viruses and the mercury and the poisons the adjuvants
[43:17.360 --> 43:23.360]  They already they're already coming for us with the aerosol spraying they're already coming with us with the positronic brainwashing on the televisions
[43:23.360 --> 43:31.360]  They're already admitting it all throwing it in our face how the robots are replacing us haha and all the rest of it and how they're gods and we're nobody
[43:31.360 --> 43:43.360]  We have nothing to lose but to resist these people in everything we've got and we're seeing their full counter strike right now
[43:43.360 --> 43:50.360]  And we're seeing the communist Chinese weigh in
[43:50.360 --> 43:58.360]  And declare at Davos two months ago we will stand against the Americans with the elite we will break Trump
[43:58.360 --> 44:05.360]  Any American that had one ounce of soul or common sense should have gotten chills for an hour when they saw that on the news
[44:05.360 --> 44:11.360]  But instead the news put it in your face like it was normal just like they say having a mother and father is bad don't say you have it
[44:11.360 --> 44:21.360]  National Geographic has all the new sexes but not a woman with a womb
[44:21.360 --> 44:30.360]  This is open scientific war carried out by those with devilish hearts against everything good
[44:30.360 --> 44:38.360]  And the horrors visited upon the third world are now being visited upon the first world
[44:38.360 --> 44:52.360]  Everything vile is being turned loose the most radical Islamic brigades are pouring into our nations into our homes into our homelands
[44:52.360 --> 45:02.360]  We see the shape of things to come the great battles from a look back on these times is calm Halcyon days blue skies endlessly clear
[45:02.360 --> 45:08.360]  The type of day where you can even see the stars at noon
[45:08.360 --> 45:17.360]  You'll look back on the times to come and the respite that was Trump even as he was successful or may not be
[45:17.360 --> 45:26.360]  As a head coming up as I've said out of the water when you're caught in a riptide and getting that one big gasp of air before you're sucked back down under
[45:26.360 --> 45:30.360]  Hoping holding your breath that you come back to the surface
[45:30.360 --> 45:33.360]  But we may not even get that breath
[45:33.360 --> 45:37.360]  Our lips are only beginning to open to try to bring in the air
[45:37.360 --> 45:43.360]  The whole power structure is there to try to clamp our mouths shut as fast as they can
[45:43.360 --> 45:50.360]  And like a satanic giant squid suck us back down into the depths
[45:50.360 --> 45:54.360]  I'm gonna play this clip
[45:54.360 --> 45:58.360]  But just think about how they told you three years ago
[45:58.360 --> 46:03.360]  Physically they had to do that so that their own people at the CIA and other places would think it was legal or lawful
[46:03.360 --> 46:08.360]  We're going to launch domestic operations down start lying about and taking over government
[46:08.360 --> 46:17.360]  Because the public might actually try to take the government back so we've got to actually occupy the United States fully now
[46:17.360 --> 46:22.360]  And now with this new law in the National Physical Authorization Act
[46:22.360 --> 46:29.360]  There's language in there not just about countering it but the full organized will to stop it
[46:29.360 --> 46:35.360]  And that means putting silencers, suppressors on the end of guns and going around killing people and saying they committed suicide
[46:35.360 --> 46:40.360]  As if that's not a two-way street
[46:40.360 --> 46:49.360]  So everybody's been warned
[46:49.360 --> 46:55.360]  We have been absolutely judicious in what we've done, measured and on target
[46:55.360 --> 47:00.360]  And unfortunately our analysis historically and by looking at the enemy's own transmissions
[47:00.360 --> 47:03.360]  The occupied force inside the gates
[47:03.360 --> 47:10.360]  We've got their dead on attack plan and if the president knows that attack plan and simply goes and fires side chats and exposes it to the public
[47:10.360 --> 47:12.360]  It's game over for the new world order
[47:12.360 --> 47:15.360]  I know a lot of his advisors say it's too extreme, sure
[47:15.360 --> 47:19.360]  No, the fact that he was being hardcore is why he got there
[47:19.360 --> 47:23.360]  Every time he calls him the enemy his approval rating goes up a couple points
[47:23.360 --> 47:25.360]  When he doesn't it goes down
[47:25.360 --> 47:29.360]  The fact that he tried to work with Ryan because they're refusing to pass a good bill
[47:29.360 --> 47:33.360]  He knows it will implode the whole economy, he doesn't at least do this half decent bill
[47:33.360 --> 47:39.360]  That has hurt Trump because he can't compromise with these rats, they're never going to back off
[47:39.360 --> 47:46.360]  Trump can't give up because they're not going to stop even if he was sold out to him, which he can't do
[47:46.360 --> 47:49.360]  Because the image of who he is has to be destroyed
[47:49.360 --> 47:51.360]  His family has to be destroyed
[47:51.360 --> 47:53.360]  The earth has to be politically salted
[47:53.360 --> 47:58.360]  And Trump understands that the nightmare system that they're bringing in is so horrible
[47:58.360 --> 48:05.360]  Why would you sell out to death itself when all you get is more death?
[48:05.360 --> 48:09.360]  Now obviously it's more important than ever that every article at infowars.com
[48:09.360 --> 48:12.360]  Every video that you send out to friends, family, neighbors
[48:12.360 --> 48:14.360]  In your own email list that you post it yourself
[48:14.360 --> 48:17.360]  I'm getting reports from everybody I know, Shane Stoner called me last night
[48:17.360 --> 48:21.360]  He said, yeah, and I was sitting there with a friend trying to post your articles to his Facebook
[48:21.360 --> 48:24.360]  And they're just deleting them as fast as they go up
[48:24.360 --> 48:30.360]  And that's because they say in this they'll work with the internet companies to shut down the Russian propaganda
[48:30.360 --> 48:32.360]  And they just label us Russian propaganda
[48:32.360 --> 48:35.360]  See, they can't get the courts to say we're fake because we're not
[48:35.360 --> 48:37.360]  They can't just get media to say it because we consume
[48:37.360 --> 48:42.360]  They have to have the red scare, but this time the real red scare was real
[48:42.360 --> 48:48.360]  This is the fake Russian scare and project it onto the patriots and try to shut us down
[48:48.360 --> 48:51.360]  And you're like, we'll never get away with it, he's making the country great again
[48:51.360 --> 48:54.360]  Americana, God Guns and Guts, curing our border
[48:54.360 --> 48:57.360]  They're the ones with the open borders, they're the ones engaged in sedition and treason
[48:57.360 --> 48:59.360]  They're the ones sold out to radical Islam
[48:59.360 --> 49:02.360]  They don't care because they've got the governments to deal
[49:02.360 --> 49:09.360]  And the rogue state intending to move forward with these attacks and they're not going to stop
[49:09.360 --> 49:14.360]  I'm gonna go to break and come back with a clip and the rest of it, but
[49:14.360 --> 49:18.360]  Before we go any further
[49:18.360 --> 49:21.360]  We sell out of this for months every time we get it in
[49:21.360 --> 49:23.360]  But once for about three months
[49:23.360 --> 49:29.360]  Because it's proprietary, it's organic, it's super blue, organic non fluoride toothpaste
[49:29.360 --> 49:35.360]  The peppermint tree oil, and this is the great part, iodine and nano silver
[49:35.360 --> 49:38.360]  Proprietary, my dad, is a dentist oral surgeon
[49:38.360 --> 49:42.360]  And we made it with the biggest company out there that produces the organic toothpaste
[49:42.360 --> 49:44.360]  It's private label
[49:44.360 --> 49:47.360]  We got some new flavors coming out soon, this is pretty strong
[49:47.360 --> 49:50.360]  We got bubblegum for the kids, it's gonna get here soon
[49:50.360 --> 49:54.360]  Bubblegum flavor that just doesn't have the tea tree oil or stronger peppermint
[49:54.360 --> 49:55.360]  But it's excellent as well
[49:55.360 --> 49:57.360]  It sells out very, very quickly
[49:57.360 --> 49:59.360]  You get multiple tubes, you can get 20% off
[49:59.360 --> 50:03.360]  But your purchase is critical to the operations obviously
[50:03.360 --> 50:06.360]  So when you're getting a Trump Tense 2020
[50:06.360 --> 50:09.360]  Keeping America great
[50:09.360 --> 50:15.360]  Shirt for $9.95, be sure and get a tube of the organic iodine silver bullet
[50:15.360 --> 50:21.360]  Toothpaste in FullWarsLive.com or AAA-253-3139
[50:21.360 --> 50:24.360]  We're under attack here, I ask for this
[50:24.360 --> 50:27.360]  I'm just saying, everybody's always wanted somebody to stand up, wanted somebody to fight back
[50:27.360 --> 50:30.360]  Somebody to really put it all on the line, somebody to be effective
[50:30.360 --> 50:33.360]  Somebody to build a media system to be able to counter the enemy
[50:33.360 --> 50:36.360]  We've done it, we've taken the field like David versus Goliath
[50:36.360 --> 50:39.360]  And we've already chopped Goliath's head off
[50:39.360 --> 50:42.360]  The problem is, the rest of the Philistines are coming down the hill on us
[50:42.360 --> 50:44.360]  And you're all standing there right behind us and you've already been supporting us
[50:44.360 --> 50:46.360]  But this is the time, folks
[50:46.360 --> 50:48.360]  We need your prayers, we need your support
[50:48.360 --> 50:50.360]  We need you to spread the links and articles
[50:50.360 --> 50:52.360]  Because they're trying to block us all over Google as you name it
[50:52.360 --> 50:54.360]  Because we're effective, we're in an info war
[50:54.360 --> 50:56.360]  It's a new kind of war, we're winning it
[50:56.360 --> 51:25.360]  But we need your help, we'll be back

[51:58.360 --> 52:03.360]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water
[52:03.360 --> 52:09.360]  If your current plan includes using a fuel burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way
[52:09.360 --> 52:12.360]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass burning cooking stove
[52:12.360 --> 52:15.360]  That only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel
[52:15.360 --> 52:22.360]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful and sustainable

[52:28.360 --> 52:32.360]  President Trump is cleaning up Washington, but the media and Barack Obama want to stop him
[52:32.360 --> 52:35.360]  They've declared total war against him
[52:35.360 --> 52:40.360]  Now, David Horowitz's big agenda reveals Obama's secret plan to destroy Trump
[52:40.360 --> 52:43.360]  Rush Limbaugh says you must read big agenda

[54:11.360 --> 54:14.360]  That's right, humanity wants freedom
[54:14.360 --> 54:19.360]  All the fake leftist ideologies of collectivism or slavery are breaking through it
[54:19.360 --> 54:22.360]  Of renegade
[54:22.360 --> 54:25.360]  Alright, let's go to the clip here
[54:25.360 --> 54:32.360]  Of the outgoing governor of the Broadcasting Board of Governors
[54:32.360 --> 54:35.360]  Who went before different Intelligence Committee hearings
[54:35.360 --> 54:37.360]  This is the Armed Services Committee
[54:37.360 --> 54:45.360]  And to the military, funding apparatus declared that Infowars is a Russian disinfo op
[54:45.360 --> 54:49.360]  Then they come out in the news and McClatchy and say, I'm being investigated
[54:49.360 --> 54:52.360]  Along with the White House chief advisor
[54:52.360 --> 54:58.360]  The guy trying to cut your taxes and secure our border and build up a giant military and bring coal back
[54:58.360 --> 55:02.360]  Which is totally like a giant sanction on Russia
[55:02.360 --> 55:04.360]  Sorry, America first
[55:04.360 --> 55:07.360]  It's not to hurt Russia. And Russians don't even get pissed at that
[55:07.360 --> 55:09.360]  They understand that this is where it goes
[55:09.360 --> 55:14.360]  The Russian operative, Stephen Mannon, is if we need the Russians
[55:14.360 --> 55:17.360]  Our team over the years has called me to come on
[55:17.360 --> 55:19.360]  And I've just been...
[55:19.360 --> 55:22.360]  I used to go on all the time and they got threatened about four years ago
[55:22.360 --> 55:25.360]  They told me, oh, they're threatening to take our license if you come on
[55:25.360 --> 55:28.360]  Because I've gone there about pro-gun stuff, sovereignty
[55:28.360 --> 55:31.360]  I was just using it as a channel to promote Americana worldwide
[55:31.360 --> 55:34.360]  Don't you want that like a real voice of America going into Russia?
[55:34.360 --> 55:38.360]  That's what I do when I'm on Japanese TV, British TV, you name it
[55:38.360 --> 55:39.360]  But I've got to where now and they've called me
[55:39.360 --> 55:43.360]  I don't even go on there because the response is so little on RT America
[55:43.360 --> 55:47.360]  And it's a bunch of leftist. Have you watched RT America?
[55:47.360 --> 55:52.360]  The idea that that influenced elections when it's only in like hotel rooms and stuff
[55:52.360 --> 55:54.360]  I've seen their ratings. It doesn't even show up
[55:54.360 --> 55:56.360]  RT's big worldwide
[55:56.360 --> 55:58.360]  But not in America
[55:58.360 --> 56:01.360]  The idea that we would write the articles at Info Wars
[56:01.360 --> 56:04.360]  And then I'd see RT rewrite them two days later
[56:04.360 --> 56:08.360]  See, they've got this butt backwards to say it nicely
[56:08.360 --> 56:13.360]  RT doesn't influence Alex Jones, I influence RT
[56:13.360 --> 56:15.360]  I influence UKIP
[56:15.360 --> 56:18.360]  The UKIP founder says the entire UKIP movement
[56:18.360 --> 56:22.360]  Sputtered for five years until he came on my show 18 years ago
[56:22.360 --> 56:24.360]  And he said it on the show repeatedly
[56:24.360 --> 56:29.360]  Half their movement came from Info Wars
[56:29.360 --> 56:32.360]  That's super libertarian right wing
[56:32.360 --> 56:34.360]  Has nothing to do with the Russians
[56:34.360 --> 56:38.360]  Info Wars is what's spreading defeating globalism
[56:38.360 --> 56:40.360]  And I'm not bragging, I don't ever want to get here and say this stuff
[56:40.360 --> 56:41.360]  I've known this for a long time
[56:41.360 --> 56:45.360]  But because they're accusing me of being a Russian operative, I have to
[56:45.360 --> 56:48.360]  That's the tail wagging the dog
[56:48.360 --> 56:49.360]  Comprende?
[56:49.360 --> 56:52.360]  Americana is the dog
[56:52.360 --> 56:54.360]  Rushes the tail
[56:54.360 --> 56:57.360]  And Podesta and all them know that
[56:57.360 --> 57:01.360]  But they got to change the subject because they're big losers
[57:01.360 --> 57:03.360]  They got caught rigging the election
[57:03.360 --> 57:04.360]  They got caught fixing everything
[57:04.360 --> 57:05.360]  I'm going to go over that in the next hour
[57:05.360 --> 57:07.360]  They got caught and they're scared
[57:07.360 --> 57:08.360]  And the people turned against them
[57:08.360 --> 57:09.360]  So what do they do?
[57:09.360 --> 57:11.360]  Ah, Russians, Russians, Russians are taking it over
[57:11.360 --> 57:13.360]  Oh my God, shut off Alex Jones
[57:13.360 --> 57:16.360]  He's fake, suing, destroying, arresting
[57:16.360 --> 57:22.360]  This has had the effect of actually intimidating some Republicans
[57:22.360 --> 57:25.360]  Let's go ahead and go to the clip of Armstrong, here it is
[57:25.360 --> 57:29.360]  Mr. Armstrong, you mentioned in your answer to
[57:29.360 --> 57:31.360]  I think Ms. Spears' question
[57:31.360 --> 57:34.360]  That there are other RT's operating in the U.S.
[57:34.360 --> 57:37.360]  Can you describe them, list them?
[57:37.360 --> 57:38.360]  Sure, thank you
[57:38.360 --> 57:44.360]  So you have RT, you have Sputnik, you have Rupley
[57:44.360 --> 57:50.360]  And then I think you have them feeding other entities
[57:50.360 --> 57:53.360]  InfoWars comes to mind where those are echo chambers
[57:53.360 --> 57:56.360]  For those modalities
[57:56.360 --> 57:58.360]  And it just goes on from there
[57:58.360 --> 58:02.360]  And then I have the Actual Defense Authorization Act, 2017
[58:02.360 --> 58:04.360]  Saying the CIA will be over the board of governors
[58:04.360 --> 58:06.360]  That guy, this whole spook cut out
[58:06.360 --> 58:08.360]  Looking at his background
[58:08.360 --> 58:10.360]  Running around, I mean, Rupley?
[58:10.360 --> 58:11.360]  Rupley's half its stuff
[58:11.360 --> 58:15.360]  Like sporting events and riots, and it's a stringer video thing
[58:15.360 --> 58:18.360]  With reporters hired around the world
[58:18.360 --> 58:22.360]  They buy video
[58:22.360 --> 58:26.360]  They're like Getty, they're Russian agents now
[58:26.360 --> 58:28.360]  Because RT tends to buy from Rupley
[58:28.360 --> 58:29.360]  Because they're cheaper
[58:29.360 --> 58:33.360]  I've licensed clips from them
[58:33.360 --> 58:37.360]  They'll probably claim that's the Russian connection
[58:37.360 --> 58:41.360]  They've played videos of Muslims rioting
[58:41.360 --> 58:43.360]  Man, they're desperate
[58:43.360 --> 58:47.360]  Folks, this means they're about to move big time against Trump
[58:47.360 --> 58:49.360]  Warning, President Trump
[58:49.360 --> 58:53.360]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best
[58:53.360 --> 58:55.360]  Nutraceutical that we can produce
[58:55.360 --> 58:59.360]  About a group you took years for to develop DNA Force for us
[58:59.360 --> 59:02.360]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex
[59:02.360 --> 59:04.360]  Because I think it's very, very important
[59:04.360 --> 59:07.360]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates
[59:07.360 --> 59:10.360]  We lose a little bit of our telomeres
[59:10.360 --> 59:13.360]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes
[59:13.360 --> 59:15.360]  But when it runs out, you start dying
[59:15.360 --> 59:19.360]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials
[59:19.360 --> 59:22.360]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world
[59:22.360 --> 59:24.360]  It works like an antioxidant
[59:24.360 --> 59:27.360]  It works to repair nerve growth factor
[59:27.360 --> 59:30.360]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount
[59:30.360 --> 59:31.360]  It's in powder form
[59:31.360 --> 59:34.360]  We have so many 5-star reviews
[59:34.360 --> 59:37.360]  I take this, this is the product that I take
[59:37.360 --> 59:39.360]  InfoWarsLife.com and the product we make
[59:39.360 --> 59:41.360]  We fight the global, we fight the new world order

[59:48.360 --> 59:59.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:00:18.360 --> 1:00:20.360]  Broadcasting worldwide
[1:00:20.360 --> 1:00:23.360]  You're listening to the voice of human resistance
[1:00:23.360 --> 1:00:28.360]  Against the technotronic technocracy kingcooper
[1:00:28.360 --> 1:00:31.360]  You're listening to Alex Jones
[1:00:31.360 --> 1:00:33.360]  You know, I'm gonna get really focused and serious
[1:00:33.360 --> 1:00:35.360]  At the start of the next segment and get into
[1:00:35.360 --> 1:00:37.360]  What they're accusing us of
[1:00:37.360 --> 1:00:39.360]  Is what they're actually doing with fake news, just info
[1:00:39.360 --> 1:00:42.360]  And now saying I'm racist and fake news and it works
[1:00:42.360 --> 1:00:43.360]  Now I'm a Russian agent
[1:00:43.360 --> 1:00:46.360]  This is like all over the news, FBI investigating it
[1:00:46.360 --> 1:00:48.360]  I mean, wow
[1:00:48.360 --> 1:00:50.360]  And they usually, when they get to a level like this
[1:00:50.360 --> 1:00:53.360]  They tend to kill people when it's just outrageous charges
[1:00:53.360 --> 1:00:56.360]  Then they kill you so they can just, you know, demonize the corpse
[1:00:56.360 --> 1:00:58.360]  But good luck, because I'm...
[1:00:58.360 --> 1:01:00.360]  It'll just make us bigger
[1:01:00.360 --> 1:01:03.360]  I guess they'll just ban my voice and everything else
[1:01:03.360 --> 1:01:04.360]  Let's go to this joke clip, though
[1:01:04.360 --> 1:01:07.360]  Russian agent clip, we made a joke a few months ago with Daria
[1:01:07.360 --> 1:01:09.360]  Here it is
[1:01:10.360 --> 1:01:14.360]  Activate Comrade Jones Phase 2
[1:01:14.360 --> 1:01:16.360]  Yes, understand
[1:01:18.360 --> 1:01:20.360]  We did this in one take
[1:01:25.360 --> 1:01:30.360]  This morning, the Washington Post reporting that a secret CIA report
[1:01:30.360 --> 1:01:33.360]  Found Russia interfered in the U.S. election
[1:01:33.360 --> 1:01:36.360]  To help Donald Trump win the White House
[1:01:36.360 --> 1:01:38.360]  We are at war with Russia
[1:01:38.360 --> 1:01:40.360]  Greg, Russian cyber-spying on the United States
[1:01:40.360 --> 1:01:42.360]  Is not anything new or anything unknown
[1:01:42.360 --> 1:01:45.360]  But it seems that this takes it to an unprecedented level
[1:01:45.360 --> 1:01:49.360]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning
[1:01:49.360 --> 1:01:51.360]  I will not let you down
[1:01:51.360 --> 1:01:54.360]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope
[1:01:54.360 --> 1:01:58.360]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot to Donald Trump and Alex Jones
[1:01:58.360 --> 1:02:01.360]  The nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread
[1:02:01.360 --> 1:02:05.360]  And the military apparatus of this country is about to be handed over to SCUM
[1:02:05.360 --> 1:02:07.360]  We're beholden to SCUM
[1:02:07.360 --> 1:02:09.360]  Russian SCUM
[1:02:09.360 --> 1:02:12.360]  You got all that?
[1:02:25.360 --> 1:02:28.360]  I was in there, they're checking the dog on my top list, yeah
[1:02:28.360 --> 1:02:31.360]  Activation of the IFA program, bravo, goblins
[1:02:34.360 --> 1:02:36.360]  Mr. Jones, report!
[1:02:36.360 --> 1:02:38.360]  What's your report?
[1:02:38.360 --> 1:02:41.360]  My report, I don't know
[1:02:41.360 --> 1:02:44.360]  Mr. Jones, you've been activated, this is very important
[1:02:44.360 --> 1:02:46.360]  You've done your job so well
[1:02:46.360 --> 1:02:48.360]  The first part of our mission is accomplished
[1:02:48.360 --> 1:02:50.360]  Mr. Trump is in the office soon
[1:02:50.360 --> 1:02:52.360]  We have to build the wall
[1:02:52.360 --> 1:02:54.360]  We have to bring the jobs back
[1:02:54.360 --> 1:02:56.360]  We have to build the economy and family
[1:02:56.360 --> 1:02:58.360]  Yes, defeat the Americans
[1:02:58.360 --> 1:03:00.360]  Stop the tranny bathrooms, yes, yes
[1:03:00.360 --> 1:03:02.360]  Yes, Mr. Jones
[1:03:02.360 --> 1:03:04.360]  Now, let me tell you, some of it is good, some bad
[1:03:04.360 --> 1:03:07.360]  They loved Hillary so beautiful and pure
[1:03:07.360 --> 1:03:09.360]  And we turned, we turned
[1:03:09.360 --> 1:03:12.360]  We turned them from the beautiful angel to the devil
[1:03:12.360 --> 1:03:16.360]  I'm sorry, I was in America, I learned that Hillary was good
[1:03:16.360 --> 1:03:18.360]  No, we have to continue to do our mission
[1:03:18.360 --> 1:03:20.360]  But comrades, he will get angry
[1:03:20.360 --> 1:03:23.360]  They learned that our top agent is Tucker Carlson
[1:03:23.360 --> 1:03:28.360]  The congressman on TV, on the Fox News, exposes
[1:03:28.360 --> 1:03:30.360]  You're carrying water for the Kremlin
[1:03:30.360 --> 1:03:32.360]  You're not carrying water for the Kremlin, you're making
[1:03:32.360 --> 1:03:34.360]  You're a sitting member of Congress on the Intel Committee
[1:03:34.360 --> 1:03:36.360]  And you can't say, they hacked
[1:03:36.360 --> 1:03:38.360]  You're gonna, you're gonna have to move your shoulder
[1:03:38.360 --> 1:03:40.360]  To our Russian television, because
[1:03:40.360 --> 1:03:43.360]  You know what, that's just so beneath your office
[1:03:43.360 --> 1:03:45.360]  Because it's so dumb and you're being depucative
[1:03:45.360 --> 1:03:47.360]  Our programs are moving forward to cut the taxes
[1:03:47.360 --> 1:03:49.360]  And to allow the Americans to breathe again
[1:03:49.360 --> 1:03:51.360]  And the program is working to contain
[1:03:51.360 --> 1:03:53.360]  The collapse of the United States, so does not
[1:03:53.360 --> 1:03:55.360]  Fold to globalism
[1:03:55.360 --> 1:03:57.360]  And the report is continuing to not fund radical
[1:03:57.360 --> 1:03:59.360]  Jihadis and other evils
[1:03:59.360 --> 1:04:02.360]  And the report is continuing to let the families
[1:04:02.360 --> 1:04:04.360]  Actually raise their children and not give them
[1:04:04.360 --> 1:04:06.360]  The vaccines and lower their IQs
[1:04:06.360 --> 1:04:08.360]  They are destroying America's land
[1:04:08.360 --> 1:04:10.360]  They are doing well
[1:04:10.360 --> 1:04:12.360]  And it's wrong because Hillary is an angel
[1:04:12.360 --> 1:04:14.360]  It's also what happens when you listen
[1:04:14.360 --> 1:04:17.360]  To the radio host, Alex Jones
[1:04:17.360 --> 1:04:20.360]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind
[1:04:20.360 --> 1:04:23.360]  Or how dark their heart must be
[1:04:23.360 --> 1:04:26.360]  I began to realize that she is an angel
[1:04:26.360 --> 1:04:28.360]  And she wants to help me
[1:04:28.360 --> 1:04:31.360]  No, no, you've got to be sent for reprogramming
[1:04:31.360 --> 1:04:33.360]  Hillary, you've got to be reprogramming
[1:04:33.360 --> 1:04:36.360]  No, no, no, no, no, no!
[1:04:36.360 --> 1:04:38.360]  No, no, you've got to be
[1:04:38.360 --> 1:04:41.360]  You've got to be sent for reprogramming
[1:04:44.360 --> 1:04:46.360]  Russian scum
[1:04:51.360 --> 1:04:52.360]  I don't
[1:04:52.360 --> 1:04:53.360]  I don't
[1:04:53.360 --> 1:04:55.360]  I don't
[1:04:56.360 --> 1:04:57.360]  We'll be back
[1:04:57.360 --> 1:05:00.360]  We'll be back
[1:05:28.360 --> 1:05:31.360]  Indicating nearly 200 illegal immigrants
[1:05:31.360 --> 1:05:34.360]  Sought for deportation were released instead
[1:05:34.360 --> 1:05:36.360]  The name and shame list was ordered
[1:05:36.360 --> 1:05:38.360]  Released by President Donald Trump
[1:05:38.360 --> 1:05:40.360]  When he signed two executive orders
[1:05:40.360 --> 1:05:42.360]  Related to immigration in January
[1:05:42.360 --> 1:05:45.360]  In response to a number of local jurisdictions
[1:05:45.360 --> 1:05:47.360]  That have refused to cooperate
[1:05:47.360 --> 1:05:50.360]  With immigration and customs enforcement
[1:05:50.360 --> 1:05:52.360]  As self-declared quote
[1:05:52.360 --> 1:05:54.360]  Sanctuary cities
[1:05:54.360 --> 1:05:56.360]  Stay tuned for more immigration news

[1:06:26.360 --> 1:06:28.360]  God was in school
[1:06:28.360 --> 1:06:30.360]  Morality had a future
[1:06:30.360 --> 1:06:32.360]  And beef was for supper
[1:06:32.360 --> 1:06:34.360]  Revelation
[1:06:34.360 --> 1:06:36.360]  Dawn of global government
[1:06:36.360 --> 1:06:37.360]  We're the solution
[1:06:37.360 --> 1:06:38.360]  Americans
[1:06:38.360 --> 1:06:56.360]  Star in Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, Jerry Boykin
[1:06:56.360 --> 1:06:57.360]  The movie.info
[1:06:57.360 --> 1:07:09.360]  Let's fix it.
[1:07:27.360 --> 1:07:28.360]  My superfemale
[1:07:28.360 --> 1:07:30.360]  I had a few bottles at my house
[1:07:30.360 --> 1:07:32.360]  And I've been taking it again
[1:07:32.360 --> 1:07:34.360]  Hitting the gym once again
[1:07:34.360 --> 1:07:35.360]  Very exciting
[1:07:35.360 --> 1:07:36.360]  Feeling great
[1:07:36.360 --> 1:07:37.360]  Looking good
[1:07:37.360 --> 1:07:40.360]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again
[1:07:40.360 --> 1:07:42.360]  So obviously the superfemale is amazing
[1:07:42.360 --> 1:07:43.360]  I love it
[1:07:43.360 --> 1:07:46.360]  Nascent iodine is essential
[1:07:46.360 --> 1:07:47.360]  Survival Shield X2
[1:07:47.360 --> 1:07:49.360]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing
[1:07:49.360 --> 1:07:51.360]  That I would suggest it's nascent iodine
[1:07:51.360 --> 1:07:53.360]  Survival Shield X2
[1:07:53.360 --> 1:07:55.360]  It's got a five-star rating
[1:07:55.360 --> 1:07:58.360]  It's a win-win.infowarslife.com
[1:08:26.360 --> 1:08:28.360]  To the Central Texas Command Center
[1:08:28.360 --> 1:08:31.360]  It's Alex Jones
[1:08:31.360 --> 1:08:34.360]  Who would have thought that the Russian command base
[1:08:34.360 --> 1:08:38.360]  Would be run by a eighth generation Texan
[1:08:38.360 --> 1:08:41.360]  Whose both sides of his family helped found the state
[1:08:41.360 --> 1:08:44.360]  And who was related on both sides of the Mayflower
[1:08:44.360 --> 1:08:46.360]  And related to a lot of the leaders
[1:08:46.360 --> 1:08:48.360]  In the Revolutionary War
[1:08:48.360 --> 1:08:49.360]  That I never even say who
[1:08:49.360 --> 1:08:51.360]  Because it just sounds too fantastical
[1:08:51.360 --> 1:08:53.360]  Directly related
[1:08:53.360 --> 1:08:56.360]  In fact, my mom and dad's family's both
[1:08:56.360 --> 1:08:58.360]  Strangely enough they've done genealogy
[1:08:58.360 --> 1:09:01.360]  Weave back and forth from the very start of the country
[1:09:01.360 --> 1:09:04.360]  From before when it was colonies
[1:09:04.360 --> 1:09:05.360]  At the very start
[1:09:05.360 --> 1:09:07.360]  It's amazing how genetics works
[1:09:07.360 --> 1:09:09.360]  And that ended up here in Texas
[1:09:09.360 --> 1:09:10.360]  Both sides of the family
[1:09:10.360 --> 1:09:12.360]  Predominantly almost all my ancestors
[1:09:12.360 --> 1:09:14.360]  Ended up moving down into Tennessee, Alabama
[1:09:14.360 --> 1:09:15.360]  You name it
[1:09:15.360 --> 1:09:17.360]  And to have most of my family that were men
[1:09:17.360 --> 1:09:20.360]  In the Cold War fighting the communists
[1:09:20.360 --> 1:09:21.360]  And the Russians in Latin America
[1:09:21.360 --> 1:09:23.360]  Europe, you name it
[1:09:23.360 --> 1:09:24.360]  And right here in Texas
[1:09:24.360 --> 1:09:26.360]  I'll just leave it at that
[1:09:26.360 --> 1:09:28.360]  To then be accused of being a
[1:09:28.360 --> 1:09:31.360]  Russian brainwashing conduit
[1:09:31.360 --> 1:09:33.360]  And I'm under investigation
[1:09:33.360 --> 1:09:34.360]  According to the FBI
[1:09:34.360 --> 1:09:36.360]  That's in McLeod, so you name it
[1:09:36.360 --> 1:09:38.360]  For actually being in league
[1:09:38.360 --> 1:09:41.360]  With Russian intelligence agents
[1:09:41.360 --> 1:09:43.360]  And so is the White House
[1:09:43.360 --> 1:09:45.360]  Chief Advisor Stephen Bannon
[1:09:45.360 --> 1:09:48.360]  Decorated Naval Officer Superpatriot
[1:09:48.360 --> 1:09:50.360]  Well, what do you do when you lose an election?
[1:09:50.360 --> 1:09:52.360]  What do you do when you're caught with CNN
[1:09:52.360 --> 1:09:53.360]  And all the other major channels
[1:09:53.360 --> 1:09:55.360]  Rigging the debates and rigging polls
[1:09:55.360 --> 1:09:57.360]  And it's in thousands of emails
[1:09:57.360 --> 1:09:58.360]  That, you know, you're involved in all sorts
[1:09:58.360 --> 1:10:00.360]  Of weird criminal activity
[1:10:00.360 --> 1:10:01.360]  What do you do when it comes out
[1:10:01.360 --> 1:10:05.360]  You're at Alistair Crowley's satanic rituals?
[1:10:05.360 --> 1:10:06.360]  What do you do when it turns out
[1:10:06.360 --> 1:10:08.360]  You're on the Communist-Chinese payroll
[1:10:08.360 --> 1:10:10.360]  And all the intelligence agencies know it?
[1:10:10.360 --> 1:10:13.360]  You boldly flip everything
[1:10:13.360 --> 1:10:15.360]  And blame the few patriots
[1:10:15.360 --> 1:10:17.360]  That have taken over the Republican Party
[1:10:17.360 --> 1:10:18.360]  With being Russian agents
[1:10:18.360 --> 1:10:20.360]  And you tell the American people
[1:10:20.360 --> 1:10:21.360]  You didn't win any election
[1:10:21.360 --> 1:10:22.360]  You're a nobody
[1:10:22.360 --> 1:10:26.360]  You lost
[1:10:26.360 --> 1:10:27.360]  That's what they've done
[1:10:27.360 --> 1:10:29.360]  Now, first, I want to go to this short piece
[1:10:29.360 --> 1:10:31.360]  It's more powerful, obviously, in video
[1:10:31.360 --> 1:10:33.360]  At infowars.com.port slash show
[1:10:33.360 --> 1:10:34.360]  Where any radio illustrator can go
[1:10:34.360 --> 1:10:36.360]  On their smart phone or their iPad
[1:10:36.360 --> 1:10:37.360]  Or whatever they've got
[1:10:37.360 --> 1:10:41.360]  Or their desktop and watch the slash TV radio show
[1:10:41.360 --> 1:10:43.360]  You can always share that link with folks
[1:10:43.360 --> 1:10:44.360]  In the information war
[1:10:44.360 --> 1:10:46.360]  In fact, that's critical
[1:10:46.360 --> 1:10:48.360]  But this is South by Southwest zombies
[1:10:48.360 --> 1:10:51.360]  Who buy into any trendiness that they're sold
[1:10:51.360 --> 1:10:53.360]  Or any trendiness that is pushed on them
[1:10:53.360 --> 1:10:56.360]  And these are the people howling with delight
[1:10:56.360 --> 1:10:59.360]  In the comment sections of media matters
[1:10:59.360 --> 1:11:01.360]  And a raw story about a rest
[1:11:01.360 --> 1:11:02.360]  Alex, he's an agent
[1:11:02.360 --> 1:11:03.360]  Shut him down
[1:11:03.360 --> 1:11:04.360]  Get rid of his speech
[1:11:04.360 --> 1:11:06.360]  Throw him in a jail cell
[1:11:06.360 --> 1:11:08.360]  Boy, you're liberal, aren't you?
[1:11:08.360 --> 1:11:10.360]  There's literally hundreds of movies
[1:11:10.360 --> 1:11:12.360]  And TV shows about the red scare
[1:11:12.360 --> 1:11:14.360]  And the black list and how
[1:11:14.360 --> 1:11:17.360]  Card-carrying communists that were admittedly
[1:11:17.360 --> 1:11:18.360]  Trying to overthrow the country
[1:11:18.360 --> 1:11:22.360]  Got banned from Hollywood
[1:11:22.360 --> 1:11:24.360]  They had free speech as American citizens
[1:11:24.360 --> 1:11:27.360]  But not working for a foreign power
[1:11:27.360 --> 1:11:31.360]  I mean, they were writing books and articles
[1:11:31.360 --> 1:11:33.360]  About how we should become communists
[1:11:33.360 --> 1:11:35.360]  And how they should arrest the opposition
[1:11:35.360 --> 1:11:36.360]  When you're saying arrest the opposition
[1:11:36.360 --> 1:11:40.360]  You no longer have free speech
[1:11:40.360 --> 1:11:42.360]  But it's who says it first
[1:11:42.360 --> 1:11:44.360]  The group that says let's arrest our opposition
[1:11:44.360 --> 1:11:45.360]  Let's kill them
[1:11:45.360 --> 1:11:48.360]  Then the other group has a right to go arrest you
[1:11:48.360 --> 1:11:50.360]  And by the way, dumboes
[1:11:50.360 --> 1:11:53.360]  That's the road this is going down
[1:11:53.360 --> 1:11:54.360]  Oh, yeah
[1:11:54.360 --> 1:11:56.360]  You thought Hillary was invincible
[1:11:56.360 --> 1:11:57.360]  And was going to win
[1:11:57.360 --> 1:11:59.360]  If you're stupid enough to try some false flags
[1:11:59.360 --> 1:12:01.360]  To blame the Liberty Movement
[1:12:01.360 --> 1:12:03.360]  If you're dumb enough to try to do this
[1:12:03.360 --> 1:12:05.360]  You're dumb enough to try to have rogue elements
[1:12:05.360 --> 1:12:06.360]  In the government that are already involved
[1:12:06.360 --> 1:12:07.360]  In all sorts of sedition
[1:12:07.360 --> 1:12:09.360]  Against the presidency and the voters
[1:12:09.360 --> 1:12:11.360]  If you are stupid enough to think
[1:12:11.360 --> 1:12:13.360]  That you're going to be able to get the dog to hunt
[1:12:13.360 --> 1:12:15.360]  To actually try to kill Trump
[1:12:15.360 --> 1:12:17.360]  And have some big COG operation
[1:12:17.360 --> 1:12:18.360]  Trump is ready
[1:12:18.360 --> 1:12:21.360]  Why do you think you put all those generals in around him?
[1:12:21.360 --> 1:12:23.360]  In fact, it's a joke at the CIA
[1:12:23.360 --> 1:12:24.360]  What you're trying
[1:12:24.360 --> 1:12:27.360]  And I mean the real CIA
[1:12:27.360 --> 1:12:29.360]  You noticed all these retired CIA guys
[1:12:29.360 --> 1:12:30.360]  Are out all over the place
[1:12:30.360 --> 1:12:33.360]  Liberal and conservative for Trump everywhere
[1:12:33.360 --> 1:12:35.360]  Because Trump's not even a conservative
[1:12:35.360 --> 1:12:37.360]  He's a populist Americana
[1:12:37.360 --> 1:12:40.360]  He's a unifier
[1:12:40.360 --> 1:12:42.360]  But first you got to admit you have a country
[1:12:42.360 --> 1:12:44.360]  To be a country, to have a culture
[1:12:44.360 --> 1:12:45.360]  And then be unified
[1:12:45.360 --> 1:12:47.360]  They call that outrageous
[1:12:47.360 --> 1:12:48.360]  Like the UN says
[1:12:48.360 --> 1:12:50.360]  Angelina Jolie last week
[1:12:50.360 --> 1:12:52.360]  We can't have a country
[1:12:52.360 --> 1:12:54.360]  Why nationalism, like it's dirty
[1:12:54.360 --> 1:12:57.360]  Is masquerading as patriotism
[1:12:57.360 --> 1:13:00.360]  As if you don't know what nationalism and patriotism is
[1:13:00.360 --> 1:13:02.360]  Patriotism is
[1:13:02.360 --> 1:13:04.360]  Being a patriot for your nation
[1:13:04.360 --> 1:13:05.360]  And the set of values in the culture
[1:13:05.360 --> 1:13:07.360]  It's the same thing
[1:13:07.360 --> 1:13:09.360]  Or it's like a man and woman
[1:13:09.360 --> 1:13:11.360]  Just in carriage
[1:13:14.360 --> 1:13:16.360]  But that's how alien this has gotten
[1:13:16.360 --> 1:13:18.360]  Where oh my gosh we can't have nationalism
[1:13:18.360 --> 1:13:21.360]  Or have a country that actually tries to have jobs inside
[1:13:21.360 --> 1:13:23.360]  And make business deals for the people
[1:13:23.360 --> 1:13:25.360]  It's supposed to be for the global elites
[1:13:25.360 --> 1:13:26.360]  So they become trillionaires
[1:13:26.360 --> 1:13:27.360]  Not just billionaires
[1:13:27.360 --> 1:13:28.360]  And can leverage out everyone
[1:13:28.360 --> 1:13:29.360]  And take over the world
[1:13:29.360 --> 1:13:30.360]  I mean what the hell
[1:13:30.360 --> 1:13:32.360]  We've got a guy trying to make America great
[1:13:32.360 --> 1:13:34.360]  He's a Russian agent
[1:13:34.360 --> 1:13:41.360]  And Alex Jones is
[1:13:45.360 --> 1:13:47.360]  That's hilarious
[1:13:47.360 --> 1:13:54.360]  That's absolutely hilarious
[1:13:54.360 --> 1:13:58.360]  I mean
[1:13:58.360 --> 1:14:03.360]  To me it's particularly insulting
[1:14:03.360 --> 1:14:06.360]  Knowing the things I know about the government
[1:14:06.360 --> 1:14:08.360]  And knowing what's gone on behind the scenes
[1:14:08.360 --> 1:14:10.360]  And knowing who the Democrats really are
[1:14:10.360 --> 1:14:12.360]  The most horrible people the world's ever seen
[1:14:12.360 --> 1:14:17.360]  And to know that they've had the communist Russians
[1:14:17.360 --> 1:14:19.360]  On their arm since 1917
[1:14:19.360 --> 1:14:20.360]  Oh no
[1:14:20.360 --> 1:14:22.360]  The Russians don't have their arm up
[1:14:22.360 --> 1:14:24.360]  The Democrats are around
[1:14:24.360 --> 1:14:25.360]  So they're around
[1:14:25.360 --> 1:14:29.360]  The Democrats literally created the Bolshevik Revolution
[1:14:29.360 --> 1:14:30.360]  Look up, look it up
[1:14:30.360 --> 1:14:31.360]  It's not even secret
[1:14:31.360 --> 1:14:33.360]  It's in the encyclopedia that
[1:14:33.360 --> 1:14:35.360]  The Democratic Party in New York
[1:14:35.360 --> 1:14:37.360]  And the Communist Party in England
[1:14:37.360 --> 1:14:39.360]  Created the Bolshevik Revolution
[1:14:39.360 --> 1:14:40.360]  And took over Russia
[1:14:40.360 --> 1:14:43.360]  And then murdered tens of millions of Christian Russians
[1:14:43.360 --> 1:14:45.360]  And they want to do the same thing here
[1:14:45.360 --> 1:14:47.360]  That's why Obama's in these secret tapes going
[1:14:47.360 --> 1:14:48.360]  I'll get these Christians
[1:14:48.360 --> 1:14:49.360]  These better cleaners
[1:14:49.360 --> 1:14:51.360]  We'll break their will, don't worry
[1:14:51.360 --> 1:14:53.360]  Ha ha ha ha ha
[1:14:53.360 --> 1:14:54.360]  Woo!
[1:14:54.360 --> 1:14:57.360]  Wow!
[1:14:57.360 --> 1:14:59.360]  And Russia finally got this big spider off of them
[1:14:59.360 --> 1:15:01.360]  It's like trying to crawl
[1:15:01.360 --> 1:15:02.360]  Trying to get on its knees
[1:15:02.360 --> 1:15:03.360]  Trying to wash the wounds out
[1:15:03.360 --> 1:15:05.360]  And they're just hopping up and down going
[1:15:05.360 --> 1:15:06.360]  No!
[1:15:06.360 --> 1:15:07.360]  You were on us for 80 years
[1:15:07.360 --> 1:15:09.360]  We're gonna get you Russians!
[1:15:09.360 --> 1:15:10.360]  And they're like
[1:15:10.360 --> 1:15:11.360]  Shut up America
[1:15:11.360 --> 1:15:12.360]  Slap us right in the face
[1:15:12.360 --> 1:15:13.360]  You lay down there
[1:15:13.360 --> 1:15:14.360]  You don't even say mother or father
[1:15:14.360 --> 1:15:17.360]  We're gonna teach your five-year-olds about sex
[1:15:17.360 --> 1:15:18.360]  On MTV
[1:15:18.360 --> 1:15:20.360]  And some of the Redstone says so
[1:15:20.360 --> 1:15:23.360]  Now you sit there and you take a...
[1:15:23.360 --> 1:15:28.360]  And Alex Jones is a Russian agent
[1:15:28.360 --> 1:15:30.360]  And they've got so much confidence
[1:15:30.360 --> 1:15:32.360]  And so many people brainwashed
[1:15:32.360 --> 1:15:34.360]  And so many cowards and yes-men in the media
[1:15:34.360 --> 1:15:36.360]  And the Congress lined up
[1:15:36.360 --> 1:15:38.360]  You can see from their confidence
[1:15:38.360 --> 1:15:42.360]  And it's ill-fated confidence
[1:15:42.360 --> 1:15:44.360]  Woo hoo hoo
[1:15:44.360 --> 1:15:46.360]  Man, they go to the next level
[1:15:46.360 --> 1:15:50.360]  It is going to be unbelievably spectacular
[1:15:50.360 --> 1:15:52.360]  It's like they haven't read in the chemistry
[1:15:52.360 --> 1:15:54.360]  But what they're mixing
[1:15:54.360 --> 1:15:57.360]  And I'm just trying to get to the exit
[1:15:57.360 --> 1:16:02.360]  Oh, and we know how this ends, by the way
[1:16:10.360 --> 1:16:11.360]  I just kind of feel like
[1:16:11.360 --> 1:16:13.360]  I metaphysically need to warn the globalists
[1:16:13.360 --> 1:16:14.360]  You need to stop
[1:16:14.360 --> 1:16:16.360]  In fact, you need to stop right now
[1:16:16.360 --> 1:16:17.360]  For your own good
[1:16:17.360 --> 1:16:18.360]  And for everybody else's good
[1:16:18.360 --> 1:16:20.360]  You need to stop right now
[1:16:20.360 --> 1:16:22.360]  Danger
[1:16:22.360 --> 1:16:23.360]  Danger
[1:16:23.360 --> 1:16:25.360]  You need to stop right now
[1:16:25.360 --> 1:16:27.360]  In fact, I'm not going to get to the piece
[1:16:27.360 --> 1:16:28.360]  On my Southwest first
[1:16:28.360 --> 1:16:30.360]  And I'm going to play at the bottom of the yard
[1:16:30.360 --> 1:16:31.360]  Because Dub tells the intro
[1:16:31.360 --> 1:16:32.360]  We're going to play in Premiere here
[1:16:32.360 --> 1:16:33.360]  That McBrain put together
[1:16:33.360 --> 1:16:34.360]  It's powerful
[1:16:34.360 --> 1:16:36.360]  Let me play, just to remind you
[1:16:36.360 --> 1:16:37.360]  Where we're at
[1:16:37.360 --> 1:16:39.360]  John McCain a week ago
[1:16:39.360 --> 1:16:42.360]  Saying that Senator Rand Paul
[1:16:42.360 --> 1:16:44.360]  Because he doesn't want treaties
[1:16:44.360 --> 1:16:45.360]  In Montenegro
[1:16:45.360 --> 1:16:48.360]  And another treaty in...
[1:16:48.360 --> 1:16:51.360]  The Civil War torn Ukraine
[1:16:51.360 --> 1:16:53.360]  And into the East
[1:16:53.360 --> 1:16:58.360]  Bordering Russia with the Crimea
[1:16:58.360 --> 1:17:00.360]  That he wasn't just going to let him
[1:17:00.360 --> 1:17:01.360]  Without debate
[1:17:01.360 --> 1:17:03.360]  Passed the treaty through to go to the
[1:17:03.360 --> 1:17:04.360]  Full Senate
[1:17:04.360 --> 1:17:06.360]  And so McCain, saying five times
[1:17:06.360 --> 1:17:07.360]  You're working for Russia says
[1:17:07.360 --> 1:17:09.360]  You are an agent of Vladimir Putin
[1:17:09.360 --> 1:17:12.360]  Remember that?
[1:17:12.360 --> 1:17:13.360]  And I didn't realize
[1:17:13.360 --> 1:17:15.360]  That that very same day
[1:17:15.360 --> 1:17:18.360]  They were in the House Intelligence Committee
[1:17:18.360 --> 1:17:20.360]  And the House Armed Services Committee
[1:17:20.360 --> 1:17:22.360]  With a bunch of CIA guys
[1:17:22.360 --> 1:17:24.360]  But a bunch of policy elite blue blood wonks
[1:17:24.360 --> 1:17:26.360]  Not the real CIA
[1:17:26.360 --> 1:17:29.360]  Not the CIA that actually doesn't work
[1:17:29.360 --> 1:17:31.360]  They were there
[1:17:31.360 --> 1:17:33.360]  Getting them ready with the bill
[1:17:33.360 --> 1:17:34.360]  Obama already got in
[1:17:34.360 --> 1:17:36.360]  In the Defense Authorization Act
[1:17:36.360 --> 1:17:38.360]  With the new NDAA
[1:17:38.360 --> 1:17:40.360]  To begin shutting down
[1:17:40.360 --> 1:17:42.360]  The conservative and libertarian media
[1:17:42.360 --> 1:17:44.360]  And banning talk radio
[1:17:44.360 --> 1:17:45.360]  And bringing back a furnace doctrine
[1:17:45.360 --> 1:17:47.360]  With the CIA over to skip the break
[1:17:47.360 --> 1:17:48.360]  Coming up
[1:17:48.360 --> 1:17:51.360]  Who the hell could come up with that?
[1:17:51.360 --> 1:17:54.360]  And it's all right here
[1:17:54.360 --> 1:17:56.360]  And of course Rand Paul came out today
[1:17:56.360 --> 1:17:58.360]  And showed his sanity
[1:17:58.360 --> 1:18:00.360]  I love Rand Paul
[1:18:00.360 --> 1:18:04.360]  He was kind of dormant
[1:18:04.360 --> 1:18:06.360]  Like a bear hibernating or something
[1:18:06.360 --> 1:18:10.360]  Off in my life years but he's back
[1:18:10.360 --> 1:18:13.360]  And
[1:18:13.360 --> 1:18:15.360]  The doctor was on the news
[1:18:15.360 --> 1:18:16.360]  And he said
[1:18:16.360 --> 1:18:17.360]  They're all over the news
[1:18:17.360 --> 1:18:19.360]  Saying they were surveilling Flynn
[1:18:19.360 --> 1:18:20.360]  And had all this stuff
[1:18:20.360 --> 1:18:21.360]  Remember?
[1:18:21.360 --> 1:18:24.360]  Of course they were surveilling Trump
[1:18:24.360 --> 1:18:26.360]  We already know that Alex
[1:18:26.360 --> 1:18:28.360]  But at least he said it
[1:18:28.360 --> 1:18:31.360]  See they create this whole false reality
[1:18:31.360 --> 1:18:32.360]  Where they stood around and tell us
[1:18:32.360 --> 1:18:34.360]  They never said they had intercepts
[1:18:34.360 --> 1:18:36.360]  Or wiretaps on the Trump people to Russians
[1:18:36.360 --> 1:18:38.360]  When it came out there was nothing in them
[1:18:38.360 --> 1:18:39.360]  Trump said okay
[1:18:39.360 --> 1:18:41.360]  You wrote the law with leaks
[1:18:41.360 --> 1:18:44.360]  They went oh we aren't surveilling
[1:18:44.360 --> 1:18:46.360]  Think about how dumb they are
[1:18:46.360 --> 1:18:48.360]  So I guess I'm in good company
[1:18:48.360 --> 1:18:51.360]  Having arm services committee hearings
[1:18:51.360 --> 1:18:55.360]  About how I'm in league with the Russians
[1:18:55.360 --> 1:18:57.360]  And again here's the headline
[1:18:57.360 --> 1:18:59.360]  McClatchy this was in hundreds of newspapers
[1:18:59.360 --> 1:19:01.360]  In fact Google the syndication of McClatchy
[1:19:01.360 --> 1:19:03.360]  Because this is like being republished
[1:19:03.360 --> 1:19:06.360]  In papers that don't even normally carry McClatchy
[1:19:06.360 --> 1:19:08.360]  And I've said McClatchy's done good work before
[1:19:08.360 --> 1:19:10.360]  At least compared to a lot of mainstream media
[1:19:10.360 --> 1:19:12.360]  Breitbart and M4's under investigation
[1:19:12.360 --> 1:19:14.360]  For ties to Russia
[1:19:14.360 --> 1:19:17.360]  And it says we're under criminal
[1:19:17.360 --> 1:19:19.360]  Investigation but the FBI
[1:19:19.360 --> 1:19:23.360]  Rarely indicts you through their
[1:19:23.360 --> 1:19:25.360]  Counter espionage arm
[1:19:25.360 --> 1:19:27.360]  What the f-
[1:19:29.360 --> 1:19:31.360]  And again this is obviously a threat
[1:19:31.360 --> 1:19:33.360]  Like stop doing what you're doing
[1:19:33.360 --> 1:19:34.360]  Stop exposing what's happening
[1:19:34.360 --> 1:19:36.360]  Stephen Van and Alex Jones
[1:19:36.360 --> 1:19:38.360]  Donald Trump we're gonna keep going this road
[1:19:38.360 --> 1:19:39.360]  Go go down the road
[1:19:39.360 --> 1:19:40.360]  Do whatever you're gonna do
[1:19:40.360 --> 1:19:42.360]  Fill your hand okay
[1:19:42.360 --> 1:19:44.360]  My family comes from Americans
[1:19:44.360 --> 1:19:46.360]  My family comes from honorable people
[1:19:46.360 --> 1:19:47.360]  That have built this country
[1:19:47.360 --> 1:19:49.360]  And have defended it and are defending it now
[1:19:49.360 --> 1:19:50.360]  And restoring it
[1:19:50.360 --> 1:19:51.360]  I'm not a coward
[1:19:51.360 --> 1:19:52.360]  I love how they always threaten us
[1:19:52.360 --> 1:19:54.360]  As if we don't know what you're capable of
[1:19:54.360 --> 1:19:56.360]  Just do it
[1:20:02.360 --> 1:20:04.360]  It's this cheesy Star Wars analogy
[1:20:04.360 --> 1:20:07.360]  Where Darth Vader says you should not have come back
[1:20:11.360 --> 1:20:13.360]  Escape is not my plan
[1:20:13.360 --> 1:20:17.360]  I intend to go head on
[1:20:17.360 --> 1:20:18.360]  Against the New World Order
[1:20:18.360 --> 1:20:19.360]  I always have
[1:20:21.360 --> 1:20:22.360]  As an example to others
[1:20:22.360 --> 1:20:24.360]  I mean if I fall like the Alamo
[1:20:24.360 --> 1:20:26.360]  I personally am not happy about that
[1:20:26.360 --> 1:20:28.360]  I want my kids to have a great future
[1:20:28.360 --> 1:20:29.360]  And have their dad there
[1:20:29.360 --> 1:20:30.360]  But they don't have a future
[1:20:30.360 --> 1:20:31.360]  If we don't pick people anyways
[1:20:31.360 --> 1:20:32.360]  I'm all in
[1:20:32.360 --> 1:20:33.360]  Feel so good
[1:20:33.360 --> 1:20:34.360]  All the chips in
[1:20:34.360 --> 1:20:35.360]  Boom baby
[1:20:35.360 --> 1:20:36.360]  Boom I love it
[1:20:36.360 --> 1:20:37.360]  Woo
[1:20:39.360 --> 1:20:41.360]  Let me sign that John Hancock
[1:20:41.360 --> 1:20:43.360]  On that Declaration of Independence
[1:20:43.360 --> 1:20:44.360]  Against the New World Order
[1:20:44.360 --> 1:20:45.360]  A lot of people are signing it
[1:20:45.360 --> 1:20:46.360]  Real small
[1:20:46.360 --> 1:20:47.360]  It's dangerous
[1:20:47.360 --> 1:20:48.360]  It was signed on
[1:20:48.360 --> 1:20:49.360]  Against the King of England
[1:20:49.360 --> 1:20:50.360]  That nobody defeated
[1:20:50.360 --> 1:20:52.360]  Britain in 400 years before that
[1:20:52.360 --> 1:20:53.360]  Not the biggest empires
[1:20:53.360 --> 1:20:54.360]  Let me just sign my name
[1:20:54.360 --> 1:20:55.360]  Real big for you
[1:20:56.360 --> 1:20:57.360]  Right there
[1:20:58.360 --> 1:21:00.360]  On the new Declaration of Independence
[1:21:00.360 --> 1:21:01.360]  You see that?
[1:21:02.360 --> 1:21:03.360]  It's ready
[1:21:09.360 --> 1:21:10.360]  I'm signed
[1:21:10.360 --> 1:21:11.360]  Ever
[1:21:11.360 --> 1:21:12.360]  Right there
[1:21:12.360 --> 1:21:13.360]  You see that?
[1:21:13.360 --> 1:21:14.360]  I love it
[1:21:16.360 --> 1:21:17.360]  It's the Animating Contest of Liberty
[1:21:17.360 --> 1:21:18.360]  It's real
[1:21:18.360 --> 1:21:19.360]  And look how weak they are
[1:21:19.360 --> 1:21:21.360]  That some operation I set up
[1:21:21.360 --> 1:21:22.360]  20-something years ago
[1:21:22.360 --> 1:21:23.360]  Was devastating them
[1:21:23.360 --> 1:21:25.360]  It's not that I'm that good
[1:21:25.360 --> 1:21:26.360]  It's that they're that weak
[1:21:26.360 --> 1:21:27.360]  And pathetic
[1:21:29.360 --> 1:21:30.360]  Oh my gosh
[1:21:30.360 --> 1:21:31.360]  They're going to call me racist
[1:21:31.360 --> 1:21:32.360]  On
[1:21:33.360 --> 1:21:34.360]  NBC's
[1:21:35.360 --> 1:21:36.360]  Comedy show
[1:21:37.360 --> 1:21:38.360]  Saturday Night Live
[1:21:38.360 --> 1:21:40.360]  They're the discredited scum
[1:21:41.360 --> 1:21:42.360]  They could say
[1:21:42.360 --> 1:21:43.360]  I robbed banks
[1:21:43.360 --> 1:21:44.360]  It isn't true
[1:21:44.360 --> 1:21:45.360]  They could make up whatever crap they want
[1:21:45.360 --> 1:21:46.360]  I don't care
[1:21:48.360 --> 1:21:50.360]  Because I know I have integrity
[1:21:50.360 --> 1:21:51.360]  I know what I stand for
[1:21:54.360 --> 1:21:56.360]  And I look at Nancy Pelosi
[1:21:56.360 --> 1:21:57.360]  And Maxine Waters
[1:21:57.360 --> 1:21:58.360]  And the leadership of the Democratic Party
[1:21:58.360 --> 1:21:59.360]  They don't even know
[1:21:59.360 --> 1:22:01.360]  What planet they're on
[1:22:01.360 --> 1:22:03.360]  And then they've got these corrupt bureaucracies
[1:22:03.360 --> 1:22:05.360]  And all these agencies playing God
[1:22:05.360 --> 1:22:08.360]  That think they can ignore the president
[1:22:08.360 --> 1:22:10.360]  And they can ignore the will of the people
[1:22:13.360 --> 1:22:14.360]  I'm not intimidated by them
[1:22:16.360 --> 1:22:17.360]  Quite the opposite
[1:22:17.360 --> 1:22:18.360]  I'm sad for them
[1:22:18.360 --> 1:22:20.360]  Because I wish they could be part
[1:22:20.360 --> 1:22:21.360]  Of the honor
[1:22:23.360 --> 1:22:24.360]  But nine times out of ten
[1:22:24.360 --> 1:22:25.360]  You go look up these people
[1:22:27.360 --> 1:22:28.360]  And they were Tories
[1:22:29.360 --> 1:22:30.360]  Or they were scumbags
[1:22:30.360 --> 1:22:32.360]  Or most of their family were swindlers
[1:22:32.360 --> 1:22:33.360]  And criminals
[1:22:33.360 --> 1:22:34.360]  And that's why they're where they are
[1:22:34.360 --> 1:22:36.360]  Because they're fake scum
[1:22:38.360 --> 1:22:39.360]  And then I'm not bragging
[1:22:39.360 --> 1:22:40.360]  You go back and look at my family
[1:22:40.360 --> 1:22:43.360]  Just devastating tyranny
[1:22:43.360 --> 1:22:44.360]  Devastating scum
[1:22:45.360 --> 1:22:46.360]  Devastating bullies
[1:22:46.360 --> 1:22:47.360]  Creating new systems
[1:22:47.360 --> 1:22:48.360]  Empowering people
[1:22:48.360 --> 1:22:49.360]  Taking on all the odds
[1:22:49.360 --> 1:22:51.360]  Winning over and over again
[1:22:51.360 --> 1:22:53.360]  Even when we are destroyed
[1:22:53.360 --> 1:22:55.360]  You're going to be destroyed
[1:22:55.360 --> 1:22:56.360]  I know it
[1:22:56.360 --> 1:22:57.360]  So feel that
[1:22:57.360 --> 1:22:58.360]  And know that
[1:22:58.360 --> 1:22:59.360]  And understand that's not confidence
[1:22:59.360 --> 1:23:00.360]  That's the fact
[1:23:00.360 --> 1:23:02.360]  You are destroyed
[1:23:02.360 --> 1:23:04.360]  You are weak like your family
[1:23:04.360 --> 1:23:06.360]  Like the trash you come from
[1:23:06.360 --> 1:23:07.360]  Remember that
[1:23:07.360 --> 1:23:09.360]  You'll never defeat humanity
[1:23:09.360 --> 1:23:11.360]  You'll never stop us
[1:23:11.360 --> 1:23:13.360]  All your robotics and GMO
[1:23:13.360 --> 1:23:15.360]  And your attempts to wreck the planet
[1:23:15.360 --> 1:23:17.360]  Are all going to come to a screeching hole
[1:23:17.360 --> 1:23:19.360]  Your attacks on humanity
[1:23:19.360 --> 1:23:21.360]  Are only going to empower us
[1:23:24.360 --> 1:23:25.360]  You don't have gravity
[1:23:25.360 --> 1:23:26.360]  You rot
[1:23:26.360 --> 1:23:27.360]  This tyranny's gravity
[1:23:27.360 --> 1:23:29.360]  And the gravity's being turned up
[1:23:29.360 --> 1:23:32.360]  To make us strong
[1:23:32.360 --> 1:23:34.360]  It's a free world universe
[1:23:34.360 --> 1:23:35.360]  It's a free will
[1:23:38.360 --> 1:23:39.360]  Alright, let's start going on these clips
[1:23:39.360 --> 1:23:41.360]  So I'm in good company
[1:23:41.360 --> 1:23:42.360]  With
[1:23:44.360 --> 1:23:45.360]  People like
[1:23:45.360 --> 1:23:46.360]  Donald Trump
[1:23:50.360 --> 1:23:51.360]  People like
[1:23:51.360 --> 1:23:52.360]  Tucker Carlson
[1:23:53.360 --> 1:23:54.360]  People like
[1:23:54.360 --> 1:23:55.360]  Senator Rand Paul
[1:23:55.360 --> 1:23:57.360]  Who dare to not just believe
[1:23:57.360 --> 1:23:59.360]  Whatever Republicans and Democrats are saying
[1:23:59.360 --> 1:24:00.360]  Making up about
[1:24:00.360 --> 1:24:02.360]  Russia this, Russia that
[1:24:02.360 --> 1:24:03.360]  If you dare to challenge it
[1:24:03.360 --> 1:24:05.360]  And say there's no proof which there isn't
[1:24:05.360 --> 1:24:07.360]  All there is is giant proof
[1:24:07.360 --> 1:24:08.360]  On the Democrat side
[1:24:11.360 --> 1:24:12.360]  Then you're a Russian agent
[1:24:12.360 --> 1:24:13.360]  Well then so be it
[1:24:13.360 --> 1:24:15.360]  Here's Senator
[1:24:15.360 --> 1:24:16.360]  Rand Paul being attacked
[1:24:16.360 --> 1:24:17.360]  By McCain last week
[1:24:19.360 --> 1:24:21.360]  The only conclusion you can draw
[1:24:21.360 --> 1:24:22.360]  When he walks away
[1:24:22.360 --> 1:24:23.360]  Is he has no argument
[1:24:23.360 --> 1:24:25.360]  To be made
[1:24:25.360 --> 1:24:27.360]  He has no justification
[1:24:27.360 --> 1:24:29.360]  For his objection
[1:24:29.360 --> 1:24:33.360]  To having a small nation
[1:24:33.360 --> 1:24:35.360]  Be part of NATO
[1:24:35.360 --> 1:24:37.360]  That is under assault from the Russians
[1:24:37.360 --> 1:24:39.360]  So I repeat again
[1:24:39.360 --> 1:24:40.360]  The center from Kentucky
[1:24:40.360 --> 1:24:42.360]  Is now working for
[1:24:42.360 --> 1:24:43.360]  Vladimir Putin
[1:24:45.360 --> 1:24:46.360]  And of course the lie is
[1:24:46.360 --> 1:24:47.360]  98% of the time
[1:24:47.360 --> 1:24:48.360]  When they're doing those procedural
[1:24:48.360 --> 1:24:49.360]  Dills you don't respond
[1:24:49.360 --> 1:24:50.360]  Or have a debate
[1:24:50.360 --> 1:24:52.360]  McCain runs in
[1:24:52.360 --> 1:24:54.360]  And tries to sneak something through
[1:24:54.360 --> 1:24:55.360]  Procedurally
[1:24:55.360 --> 1:24:56.360]  He runs down, blocks it, leaves
[1:24:56.360 --> 1:24:57.360]  Well let's start a war
[1:24:57.360 --> 1:24:58.360]  In Montenegro
[1:24:58.360 --> 1:25:00.360]  Send in troops to Montenegro
[1:25:00.360 --> 1:25:01.360]  No McCain, sorry
[1:25:01.360 --> 1:25:02.360]  You're not starting a war there
[1:25:02.360 --> 1:25:03.360]  In the Balkans
[1:25:05.360 --> 1:25:06.360]  Just like you and the Clintons
[1:25:06.360 --> 1:25:07.360]  Did before in the 90s
[1:25:07.360 --> 1:25:09.360]  To bring the Muslims in
[1:25:09.360 --> 1:25:10.360]  Out of Albania
[1:25:10.360 --> 1:25:11.360]  Take one third of Serbia
[1:25:11.360 --> 1:25:12.360]  And then have the news
[1:25:12.360 --> 1:25:14.360]  Say Serbia was involved in atrocities
[1:25:14.360 --> 1:25:15.360]  BS
[1:25:15.360 --> 1:25:16.360]  Double the Serbs died
[1:25:16.360 --> 1:25:17.360]  And they didn't start the war
[1:25:17.360 --> 1:25:19.360]  Just like McCain started the Ukraine
[1:25:19.360 --> 1:25:20.360]  War
[1:25:20.360 --> 1:25:21.360]  When George Soros
[1:25:21.360 --> 1:25:22.360]  Brags about it
[1:25:22.360 --> 1:25:23.360]  And then says the Russians
[1:25:23.360 --> 1:25:24.360]  Have started it
[1:25:25.360 --> 1:25:26.360]  Oh the Russians
[1:25:26.360 --> 1:25:28.360]  Only kept 15% of the country
[1:25:28.360 --> 1:25:30.360]  When half of it's been historically Russian
[1:25:30.360 --> 1:25:31.360]  So you can't murder
[1:25:31.360 --> 1:25:32.360]  All the ethnic Russians
[1:25:33.360 --> 1:25:35.360]  When 98% in polls
[1:25:35.360 --> 1:25:36.360]  In Ukraine
[1:25:36.360 --> 1:25:37.360]  In the eastern part
[1:25:37.360 --> 1:25:38.360]  Want Russia to come back in
[1:25:39.360 --> 1:25:40.360]  That isn't me siding with Russia
[1:25:40.360 --> 1:25:42.360]  It's siding with sanity
[1:25:44.360 --> 1:25:46.360]  You started the war, McCain
[1:25:46.360 --> 1:25:48.360]  You're a globalist agent
[1:25:48.360 --> 1:25:50.360]  You work with that Nazi collaborator
[1:25:50.360 --> 1:25:51.360]  George Soros
[1:25:51.360 --> 1:25:52.360]  When is he going to roll over
[1:25:52.360 --> 1:25:53.360]  Like David Rockefeller
[1:25:53.360 --> 1:25:54.360]  Good God
[1:25:54.360 --> 1:25:57.360]  We've got another 12 years of him
[1:25:57.360 --> 1:25:59.360]  Please 101
[1:26:01.360 --> 1:26:02.360]  People are cancer
[1:26:02.360 --> 1:26:03.360]  John McCain is cancer
[1:26:03.360 --> 1:26:04.360]  To this country
[1:26:05.360 --> 1:26:07.360]  So here's Tucker Carlson
[1:26:07.360 --> 1:26:09.360]  Again with the other little weirdo
[1:26:09.360 --> 1:26:10.360]  I mean I'm sorry
[1:26:10.360 --> 1:26:11.360]  I'm not saying that
[1:26:11.360 --> 1:26:12.360]  That chef is a pervert
[1:26:12.360 --> 1:26:14.360]  He has the biggest pervert eyes
[1:26:14.360 --> 1:26:15.360]  I've ever seen
[1:26:16.360 --> 1:26:17.360]  Some guys look like serial killers
[1:26:17.360 --> 1:26:18.360]  Now serial killer eyes
[1:26:18.360 --> 1:26:20.360]  I mean this guy's got pervert eyes
[1:26:20.360 --> 1:26:21.360]  But what I do know is
[1:26:21.360 --> 1:26:23.360]  He's up there perving around
[1:26:23.360 --> 1:26:24.360]  With our constitution
[1:26:24.360 --> 1:26:25.360]  Trying to say Tucker Carlson's
[1:26:25.360 --> 1:26:26.360]  Carrying water for Putin
[1:26:26.360 --> 1:26:27.360]  Here it is
[1:26:27.360 --> 1:26:28.360]  Water for the Kremlin
[1:26:28.360 --> 1:26:30.360]  I'm not carrying water for the Kremlin
[1:26:30.360 --> 1:26:31.360]  You're a sitting member of Congress
[1:26:31.360 --> 1:26:32.360]  On the Intel Committee
[1:26:32.360 --> 1:26:33.360]  And you can't say
[1:26:33.360 --> 1:26:34.360]  They hacked
[1:26:34.360 --> 1:26:36.360]  You're going to have to move your shoulder
[1:26:36.360 --> 1:26:37.360]  To our teeth
[1:26:37.360 --> 1:26:38.360]  Russian television
[1:26:38.360 --> 1:26:39.360]  Because
[1:26:39.360 --> 1:26:41.360]  That's just so beneath your office
[1:26:41.360 --> 1:26:43.360]  Because it's so dumb and you're being
[1:26:43.360 --> 1:26:44.360]  Alright now let's
[1:26:44.360 --> 1:26:45.360]  And there's a bunch of these
[1:26:45.360 --> 1:26:47.360]  But of course they've said
[1:26:47.360 --> 1:26:49.360]  Trump's the Duke of Putin
[1:26:49.360 --> 1:26:51.360]  Let's go ahead and go to the next clip
[1:26:51.360 --> 1:26:53.360]  Again this is the outgoing head
[1:26:53.360 --> 1:26:54.360]  Of the Board of Governors
[1:26:54.360 --> 1:26:55.360]  Of the FCC
[1:26:55.360 --> 1:26:56.360]  That under now new law
[1:26:56.360 --> 1:26:58.360]  That Trump hasn't repealed or blocked
[1:26:58.360 --> 1:27:00.360]  This has I guess been an issue
[1:27:00.360 --> 1:27:01.360]  That they want to ban
[1:27:01.360 --> 1:27:02.360]  Breitbart Info Wars
[1:27:02.360 --> 1:27:03.360]  And we're Russian agents
[1:27:03.360 --> 1:27:04.360]  And in the legislation it says
[1:27:04.360 --> 1:27:06.360]  They could even use force
[1:27:06.360 --> 1:27:08.360]  Military guys could come and kill us
[1:27:08.360 --> 1:27:10.360]  Which the left I'm sure would just love
[1:27:12.360 --> 1:27:13.360]  So let's go back to the clip
[1:27:13.360 --> 1:27:15.360]  Here it is
[1:27:15.360 --> 1:27:16.360]  I'm Mr. Armstrong
[1:27:16.360 --> 1:27:18.360]  You mentioned in your answer to
[1:27:18.360 --> 1:27:20.360]  I think this fears question
[1:27:20.360 --> 1:27:22.360]  That there are other RT's operating
[1:27:22.360 --> 1:27:23.360]  In the US
[1:27:23.360 --> 1:27:26.360]  Can you describe them, list them?
[1:27:26.360 --> 1:27:27.360]  Sure thank you
[1:27:27.360 --> 1:27:30.360]  So you have RT
[1:27:30.360 --> 1:27:31.360]  You have Sputnik
[1:27:31.360 --> 1:27:33.360]  You have Rupley
[1:27:33.360 --> 1:27:35.360]  And then I think you have them
[1:27:35.360 --> 1:27:39.360]  Feeding other entities
[1:27:39.360 --> 1:27:40.360]  Info Wars comes to mind
[1:27:40.360 --> 1:27:42.360]  Where those are echo chambers
[1:27:42.360 --> 1:27:44.360]  For those modalities
[1:27:51.360 --> 1:27:53.360]  Sputnik
[1:27:53.360 --> 1:27:55.360]  It's a website in Russia
[1:27:55.360 --> 1:27:57.360]  Has almost no effect in the US
[1:27:57.360 --> 1:28:00.360]  Rupley is like
[1:28:00.360 --> 1:28:02.360]  Getty and gathers videos and photos
[1:28:02.360 --> 1:28:04.360]  And clips from like football games
[1:28:04.360 --> 1:28:07.360]  And movie stars and Muslims rioting
[1:28:07.360 --> 1:28:09.360]  I've got a stack in this here
[1:28:09.360 --> 1:28:10.360]  We're going to cover when we come back
[1:28:10.360 --> 1:28:12.360]  From breaking up the phones up on this
[1:28:12.360 --> 1:28:13.360]  This is an attack on free press
[1:28:13.360 --> 1:28:14.360]  An attack on Trump
[1:28:14.360 --> 1:28:16.360]  They're dropping the hammer here
[1:28:16.360 --> 1:28:17.360]  This is a total declaration of war
[1:28:17.360 --> 1:28:19.360]  I told you months ago this was coming
[1:28:19.360 --> 1:28:20.360]  But now it's no longer my gut
[1:28:20.360 --> 1:28:21.360]  Which is always right
[1:28:21.360 --> 1:28:22.360]  It's now documented
[1:28:22.360 --> 1:28:24.360]  I've got stacks of news where
[1:28:24.360 --> 1:28:25.360]  Google fixed searches for Hillary
[1:28:25.360 --> 1:28:26.360]  Blocked everybody else
[1:28:26.360 --> 1:28:28.360]  Launched massive bots with Facebook
[1:28:28.360 --> 1:28:29.360]  Twitter and Google
[1:28:29.360 --> 1:28:30.360]  To massively boost Hillary
[1:28:30.360 --> 1:28:33.360]  Bandlinks promoting Trump
[1:28:33.360 --> 1:28:34.360]  20th Century Fox
[1:28:34.360 --> 1:28:36.360]  Put out over 100 fake websites
[1:28:36.360 --> 1:28:37.360]  With thousands of fake news articles
[1:28:37.360 --> 1:28:39.360]  Trying to stop Trump
[1:28:39.360 --> 1:28:40.360]  With all sorts of horrible lies
[1:28:40.360 --> 1:28:41.360]  About him and the Washington Post
[1:28:41.360 --> 1:28:42.360]  Admitted that
[1:28:42.360 --> 1:28:43.360]  No problem, no big deal
[1:28:43.360 --> 1:28:44.360]  New York Times admits it
[1:28:44.360 --> 1:28:47.360]  Jeff Bezos, 600 million from the CIA
[1:28:47.360 --> 1:28:49.360]  To put out propaganda through his platforms
[1:28:49.360 --> 1:28:51.360]  And it's just that that's the Atlantic magazine
[1:28:51.360 --> 1:28:52.360]  All of it admitted
[1:28:52.360 --> 1:28:53.360]  All the articles where they admit
[1:28:53.360 --> 1:28:55.360]  That they have legalized fake news
[1:28:55.360 --> 1:28:57.360]  Against Alex Jones with the CIA
[1:28:57.360 --> 1:29:00.360]  I mean, you got a bunch of leftist
[1:29:00.360 --> 1:29:02.360]  And weirdos and Ivy League kids
[1:29:02.360 --> 1:29:04.360]  Who've got like a score to settle
[1:29:04.360 --> 1:29:05.360]  With America
[1:29:05.360 --> 1:29:06.360]  And a score to settle
[1:29:06.360 --> 1:29:08.360]  With guys that are bigger and tougher
[1:29:08.360 --> 1:29:09.360]  Than them
[1:29:09.360 --> 1:29:10.360]  That's what this is
[1:29:10.360 --> 1:29:11.360]  All this
[1:29:11.360 --> 1:29:12.360]  I'm nothing against nerds
[1:29:12.360 --> 1:29:13.360]  But this is ruled by nerds
[1:29:13.360 --> 1:29:15.360]  They don't want prosperity
[1:29:15.360 --> 1:29:16.360]  They want
[1:29:16.360 --> 1:29:18.360]  Bill Gates wants you to sit there
[1:29:18.360 --> 1:29:20.360]  And take inoculations full of cancer viruses
[1:29:20.360 --> 1:29:22.360]  See you roll over and die
[1:29:22.360 --> 1:29:23.360]  And he just gets off on it
[1:29:23.360 --> 1:29:24.360]  Okay
[1:29:24.360 --> 1:29:25.360]  I mean, that's what they do
[1:29:25.360 --> 1:29:27.360]  And they're just total trash
[1:29:27.360 --> 1:29:30.360]  I mean, they're your enemy
[1:29:30.360 --> 1:29:31.360]  Like why somebody want to grab
[1:29:31.360 --> 1:29:32.360]  Your kid on the backyard
[1:29:32.360 --> 1:29:33.360]  Go torture them
[1:29:33.360 --> 1:29:34.360]  It's just how they are
[1:29:34.360 --> 1:29:35.360]  It's their nature
[1:29:35.360 --> 1:29:36.360]  And those of us that aren't into that
[1:29:36.360 --> 1:29:37.360]  We don't get it, okay
[1:29:37.360 --> 1:29:40.360]  So the good news is
[1:29:40.360 --> 1:29:42.360]  I'm gonna finish up with all this
[1:29:42.360 --> 1:29:43.360]  Go to your calls and a lot more
[1:29:43.360 --> 1:29:45.360]  We have a special intro coming up
[1:29:45.360 --> 1:29:46.360]  That ties into a lot of things
[1:29:46.360 --> 1:30:08.360]  To stay with us
[1:30:16.360 --> 1:30:17.360]  And that's what we're doing
[1:30:17.360 --> 1:30:19.360]  To protect 100,000 or more people
[1:30:19.360 --> 1:30:22.360]  Carlsbad is expanding its use
[1:30:22.360 --> 1:30:24.360]  Of automatic license plate readers
[1:30:24.360 --> 1:30:26.360]  Into a system that aims to collect
[1:30:26.360 --> 1:30:28.360]  The registration information
[1:30:28.360 --> 1:30:31.360]  Of every vehicle that enters the city
[1:30:31.360 --> 1:30:34.360]  The $1 million police department project
[1:30:34.360 --> 1:30:36.360]  Which will add stationary cameras
[1:30:36.360 --> 1:30:39.360]  At 14 key Carlsbad intersections
[1:30:39.360 --> 1:30:41.360]  Creating a virtual gateway
[1:30:41.360 --> 1:30:43.360]  At the city's borders
[1:30:43.360 --> 1:30:45.360]  Was approved by the city council last week
[1:30:45.360 --> 1:30:47.360]  Sparking outrage over privacy rights
[1:30:47.360 --> 1:30:50.360]  And government control from several residents
[1:30:50.360 --> 1:30:52.360]  And one council member

[1:32:30.360 --> 1:32:32.360]  The molecular weight allyethylene
[1:32:32.360 --> 1:32:35.360]  Defender armor is also super compact and lightweight
[1:32:35.360 --> 1:32:37.360]  There's a reason the department of defense
[1:32:37.360 --> 1:32:39.360]  Chose Defender to manufacture their new line
[1:32:39.360 --> 1:32:41.360]  Of advanced lightweight armor
[1:32:41.360 --> 1:32:42.360]  It works
[1:32:42.360 --> 1:32:44.360]  Defender body armor is made right here in America
[1:32:44.360 --> 1:32:46.360]  And has received the highest level
[1:32:46.360 --> 1:32:48.360]  Ballistic resistance certification
[1:32:48.360 --> 1:32:50.360]  From an authorized NIJ ballistic laboratory
[1:32:50.360 --> 1:32:52.360]  Defender body armor is now available
[1:32:52.360 --> 1:32:54.360]  Through infowarsteam.com
[1:32:54.360 --> 1:32:56.360]  This is the globalist all at the same time
[1:32:56.360 --> 1:33:00.360]  A total 360 win
[1:33:00.360 --> 1:33:02.360]  This program contains language
[1:33:02.360 --> 1:33:06.360]  And sequences some viewers may find disturbing
[1:33:06.360 --> 1:33:08.360]  The nation and all of our freedoms
[1:33:08.360 --> 1:33:10.360]  Hang by a thread
[1:33:10.360 --> 1:33:12.360]  And the military apparatus of this country
[1:33:12.360 --> 1:33:14.360]  Is about to be handed over to SCUM
[1:33:14.360 --> 1:33:16.360]  We're beholden to SCUM
[1:33:16.360 --> 1:33:18.360]  And the Russian is SCUM
[1:33:18.360 --> 1:33:24.360]  Listen

[1:33:28.360 --> 1:33:30.360]  If you fail to understand
[1:33:30.360 --> 1:33:32.360]  Then the same incredible terror
[1:33:32.360 --> 1:33:34.360]  That's menacing me will strike at you
[1:33:34.360 --> 1:33:36.360]  The function of all life
[1:33:36.360 --> 1:33:38.360]  Is survival
[1:33:38.360 --> 1:33:40.360]  Sleep
[1:33:40.360 --> 1:33:42.360]  Sleep
[1:33:42.360 --> 1:33:44.360]  Sleep

[1:33:58.360 --> 1:34:00.360]  Please listen to me
[1:34:00.360 --> 1:34:02.360]  Something terrible
[1:34:02.360 --> 1:34:04.360]  They're already here
[1:34:04.360 --> 1:34:06.360]  Your next
[1:34:06.360 --> 1:34:08.360]  They're coming
[1:34:08.360 --> 1:34:10.360]  Sleep
[1:34:10.360 --> 1:34:12.360]  The seed is planted
[1:34:12.360 --> 1:34:14.360]  Terror grows
[1:34:14.360 --> 1:34:16.360]  Elizabeth, wake up
[1:34:16.360 --> 1:34:18.360]  Get you when you sleep
[1:34:18.360 --> 1:34:20.360]  Sit up
[1:34:20.360 --> 1:34:22.360]  Invasion of the body snatchers
[1:34:22.360 --> 1:34:24.360]  All of a sudden they're growing like parasites
[1:34:24.360 --> 1:34:26.360]  Is it contagious?
[1:34:26.360 --> 1:34:28.360]  Drop
[1:34:28.360 --> 1:34:30.360]  It looked right after you
[1:34:30.360 --> 1:34:32.360]  You're looking at it as if it was human
[1:34:32.360 --> 1:34:34.360]  It was not human
[1:34:34.360 --> 1:34:36.360]  Now
[1:34:36.360 --> 1:34:38.360]  The classic fear begins to grow
[1:34:38.360 --> 1:34:40.360]  We're being cornered
[1:34:40.360 --> 1:34:42.360]  In a modern masterpiece
[1:34:42.360 --> 1:34:44.360]  Of science fiction
[1:34:44.360 --> 1:34:46.360]  You're barricaded in the street
[1:34:46.360 --> 1:34:48.360]  Invasion of the body snatchers
[1:35:00.360 --> 1:35:02.360]  What happens?
[1:35:04.360 --> 1:35:06.360]  Man fiction meets reality
[1:35:06.360 --> 1:35:08.360]  The mob psychosis
[1:35:08.360 --> 1:35:10.360]  And mass media programming
[1:35:12.360 --> 1:35:14.360]  Creates
[1:35:14.360 --> 1:35:16.360]  A servile mass of programmable
[1:35:16.360 --> 1:35:18.360]  Biological androids
[1:35:18.360 --> 1:35:20.360]  This happens
[1:35:22.360 --> 1:35:24.360]  The year is 2017
[1:35:24.360 --> 1:35:26.360]  With the implosion of Hollywood
[1:35:26.360 --> 1:35:28.360]  The state of California itself
[1:35:28.360 --> 1:35:30.360]  Has entered a death spiral
[1:35:30.360 --> 1:35:32.360]  And the communist Chinese
[1:35:32.360 --> 1:35:34.360]  Have bought up the remnants
[1:35:34.360 --> 1:35:36.360]  Out of this narcissistic hellhole
[1:35:36.360 --> 1:35:38.360]  Millions upon millions
[1:35:38.360 --> 1:35:40.360]  Of brain damaged
[1:35:40.360 --> 1:35:42.360]  Culture warped zombies
[1:35:42.360 --> 1:35:44.360]  Tens of thousands of hours
[1:35:44.360 --> 1:35:46.360]  Of screen time every year
[1:35:46.360 --> 1:35:48.360]  Lowers their brain waves into a sweep
[1:35:48.360 --> 1:35:50.360]  Like trance where they can then
[1:35:50.360 --> 1:35:52.360]  Be completely programmed
[1:35:52.360 --> 1:35:54.360]  But not just in Austin, Texas
[1:35:54.360 --> 1:35:56.360]  Or Los Angeles, California
[1:35:56.360 --> 1:35:58.360]  All over the country
[1:35:58.360 --> 1:36:00.360]  We find that SJWs and trendies
[1:36:00.360 --> 1:36:02.360]  Are unable to defend their political ideas
[1:36:02.360 --> 1:36:04.360]  And normally only cuss, scream
[1:36:04.360 --> 1:36:06.360]  Or how
[1:36:06.360 --> 1:36:08.360]  Very similar to what we saw
[1:36:08.360 --> 1:36:10.360]  In the 1970s remake of the body snatchers
[1:36:10.360 --> 1:36:12.360]  Here is
[1:36:12.360 --> 1:36:14.360]  The incredibly frightening truth
[1:36:14.360 --> 1:36:16.360]  What has been done to these people
[1:36:16.360 --> 1:36:18.360]  This is
[1:36:18.360 --> 1:36:20.360]  Mind control
[1:36:20.360 --> 1:36:22.360]  Decades before parasitic spores
[1:36:22.360 --> 1:36:24.360]  It already found their way to Austin
[1:36:24.360 --> 1:36:26.360]  The Austin Chronicle
[1:36:26.360 --> 1:36:28.360]  And newest black established
[1:36:28.360 --> 1:36:30.360]  South by Southwest
[1:36:30.360 --> 1:36:32.360]  And like mobs to a flame
[1:36:32.360 --> 1:36:34.360]  They come
[1:36:34.360 --> 1:36:36.360]  To the new Hollywood
[1:36:36.360 --> 1:36:38.360]  The unthinking Zom trimbioids
[1:36:38.360 --> 1:36:40.360]  Are not escaping California, New York
[1:36:40.360 --> 1:36:42.360]  And other wastelands
[1:36:42.360 --> 1:36:44.360]  To establish a new free outpost
[1:36:44.360 --> 1:36:46.360]  They come to destroy the prosperity
[1:36:46.360 --> 1:36:48.360]  They come seeking fame
[1:36:48.360 --> 1:36:50.360]  They come to the new California outpost
[1:36:50.360 --> 1:36:52.360]  A new place where dreams
[1:36:52.360 --> 1:36:54.360]  Are stolen and destroyed
[1:36:54.360 --> 1:36:56.360]  By parasites that sit upon it
[1:36:56.360 --> 1:36:58.360]  Playing upon the hopes and dreams
[1:36:58.360 --> 1:37:00.360]  Of the young, the gullible
[1:37:00.360 --> 1:37:02.360]  And the stupid
[1:37:02.360 --> 1:37:04.360]  South by Southwest
[1:37:04.360 --> 1:37:06.360]  The beautiful cancer
[1:37:06.360 --> 1:37:08.360]  Now metastasizing to the one great city of Austin
[1:37:08.360 --> 1:37:10.360]  And spreading beyond
[1:37:10.360 --> 1:37:12.360]  The anti-liberal workshops
[1:37:12.360 --> 1:37:14.360]  Operate under the name of liberalism
[1:37:14.360 --> 1:37:16.360]  The hopeless zombies pay high
[1:37:16.360 --> 1:37:18.360]  Dollar to sit in the workshops
[1:37:18.360 --> 1:37:20.360]  And be taught that censorship
[1:37:20.360 --> 1:37:22.360]  Is good
[1:37:22.360 --> 1:37:24.360]  Owning homes and cars is bad
[1:37:24.360 --> 1:37:26.360]  And that renting from the big
[1:37:26.360 --> 1:37:28.360]  Central megabags is the ultimate
[1:37:28.360 --> 1:37:30.360]  Of success
[1:37:30.360 --> 1:37:32.360]  In short, South by Southwest
[1:37:32.360 --> 1:37:34.360]  In Austin, Texas is making slavery
[1:37:34.360 --> 1:37:36.360]  Cool again
[1:37:36.360 --> 1:37:38.360]  And inducting the already scammed
[1:37:38.360 --> 1:37:40.360]  Californians and others
[1:37:40.360 --> 1:37:42.360]  Into a new, even more wondrous fraud
[1:37:42.360 --> 1:37:44.360]  Agenda 21 is the process
[1:37:44.360 --> 1:37:46.360]  Of drawing humans out of their normal environment
[1:37:46.360 --> 1:37:48.360]  And putting them into artificial environments
[1:37:48.360 --> 1:37:50.360]  Where they can be surveilled, controlled
[1:37:50.360 --> 1:37:52.360]  And socially engineered
[1:37:52.360 --> 1:37:54.360]  Towards the final aim of the one world
[1:37:54.360 --> 1:37:56.360]  Technocracy, mass population
[1:37:56.360 --> 1:37:58.360]  Reduction, and the new utopia
[1:37:58.360 --> 1:38:00.360]  Of the elite on the now depopulated
[1:38:00.360 --> 1:38:02.360]  Planet. We give you
[1:38:02.360 --> 1:38:04.360]  Austin, Texas, the new
[1:38:04.360 --> 1:38:06.360]  Example of fraud and corruption
[1:38:10.360 --> 1:38:12.360]  That video just went up
[1:38:12.360 --> 1:38:14.360]  Agenda 21 Cancer
[1:38:14.360 --> 1:38:16.360]  On Infowars.com
[1:38:16.360 --> 1:38:18.360]  And it's also on the
[1:38:18.360 --> 1:38:20.360]  Alex Jones channel
[1:38:20.360 --> 1:38:22.360]  So please spread that to everyone
[1:38:22.360 --> 1:38:24.360]  You know, Facebook it, get it out on Twitter
[1:38:24.360 --> 1:38:26.360]  Because they're blocking us more and more
[1:38:26.360 --> 1:38:28.360]  But experience the blocking for yourself
[1:38:28.360 --> 1:38:30.360]  You need to fund this operation
[1:38:30.360 --> 1:38:32.360]  And everything I do is a win-win
[1:38:32.360 --> 1:38:34.360]  My dad is a dentist and oral surgeon
[1:38:34.360 --> 1:38:36.360]  About to retire hopefully
[1:38:36.360 --> 1:38:38.360]  But he works with us some
[1:38:38.360 --> 1:38:40.360]  And he worked with the biggest anti-fluoride
[1:38:40.360 --> 1:38:42.360]  Fluoride-free toothpaste maker in the country
[1:38:42.360 --> 1:38:44.360]  Everybody knows their name
[1:38:44.360 --> 1:38:46.360]  Named after a state up north
[1:38:46.360 --> 1:38:48.360]  But we're private labels, we're not supposed to say
[1:38:48.360 --> 1:38:50.360]  Where we get it manufactured by
[1:38:50.360 --> 1:38:52.360]  That's high quality
[1:38:52.360 --> 1:38:54.360]  Loyal silver and iodine
[1:38:56.360 --> 1:38:58.360]  It's got 4.8 reviews
[1:38:58.360 --> 1:39:00.360]  By the hundreds, super blue
[1:39:00.360 --> 1:39:02.360]  Now back in stock, a limited run
[1:39:02.360 --> 1:39:04.360]  Believe me, I wouldn't be able to get more of it
[1:39:04.360 --> 1:39:06.360]  But we're having issue with the tubes, we may change the tubes
[1:39:06.360 --> 1:39:08.360]  We're getting
[1:39:08.360 --> 1:39:10.360]  It's made with all natural ingredients
[1:39:10.360 --> 1:39:12.360]  Very, very high quality, people absolutely love it
[1:39:12.360 --> 1:39:14.360]  And you can get it as low as $8
[1:39:14.360 --> 1:39:16.360]  It costs us like $3-4 of tubes
[1:39:16.360 --> 1:39:18.360]  We need to make a few bucks on this to fund the operation
[1:39:18.360 --> 1:39:20.360]  Because you have to do these, your own runs
[1:39:20.360 --> 1:39:22.360]  As we expand the amount we produce
[1:39:22.360 --> 1:39:24.360]  It may go down in price, obviously, as we scale up
[1:39:24.360 --> 1:39:26.360]  But it's still a great price, you help fund the operation
[1:39:26.360 --> 1:39:28.360]  You can get it even less expensive
[1:39:28.360 --> 1:39:30.360]  If you order it in bulk
[1:39:30.360 --> 1:39:32.360]  InfoWars, live.com, infowarsstore.com
[1:39:32.360 --> 1:39:34.360]  Or call toll-free
[1:39:34.360 --> 1:39:36.360]  Triple-8, 2-5, 3-3-1, 3-9
[1:39:36.360 --> 1:39:38.360]  Back in stock, super blue
[1:39:38.360 --> 1:39:40.360]  Fluoride-free toothpaste
[1:39:40.360 --> 1:39:42.360]  And soon we're going to have the bubblegum flavor in
[1:39:42.360 --> 1:39:44.360]  For kids, because this is pretty strong
[1:39:44.360 --> 1:39:46.360]  Toothpaste, it's concentrated as well
[1:39:46.360 --> 1:39:48.360]  A little pea-sized works when you usually have to
[1:39:48.360 --> 1:39:50.360]  Load your
[1:39:50.360 --> 1:39:52.360]  Brush up with other types
[1:39:52.360 --> 1:39:54.360]  So this has the iodine-nanosilver
[1:39:54.360 --> 1:39:56.360]  It's amazing
[1:39:56.360 --> 1:39:58.360]  Four ounces of its big tube
[1:39:58.360 --> 1:40:00.360]  And it's made right here
[1:40:00.360 --> 1:40:02.360]  In America, it's high quality
[1:40:02.360 --> 1:40:04.360]  InfoWars, live.com
[1:40:04.360 --> 1:40:06.360]  Or triple-8, 2-5, 3-3-1, 3-9
[1:40:06.360 --> 1:40:08.360]  The bubblegum flavor
[1:40:08.360 --> 1:40:10.360]  Will not have the tea tree oil
[1:40:10.360 --> 1:40:12.360]  And reduces the amount of peppermint in it
[1:40:12.360 --> 1:40:14.360]  Because it is strong, it's concentrated
[1:40:14.360 --> 1:40:16.360]  I mean, I've got a pretty strong palette
[1:40:16.360 --> 1:40:18.360]  And I like it, but it's still strong for me
[1:40:18.360 --> 1:40:20.360]  So not
[1:40:20.360 --> 1:40:22.360]  Probably good for the youngins
[1:40:22.360 --> 1:40:24.360]  We got a bunch of complaints
[1:40:24.360 --> 1:40:26.360]  Five, six months ago when this first came out
[1:40:26.360 --> 1:40:28.360]  And so we went back to the drawing board
[1:40:28.360 --> 1:40:30.360]  And with bubblegum flavor for the kids
[1:40:30.360 --> 1:40:32.360]  Still a really good toothpaste
[1:40:32.360 --> 1:40:34.360]  Still got the colloidal silver
[1:40:34.360 --> 1:40:36.360]  Still got the iodine, just has reduced peppermint
[1:40:36.360 --> 1:40:38.360]  And no tea tree oil
[1:40:38.360 --> 1:40:40.360]  In the new one that's coming out
[1:40:40.360 --> 1:40:42.360]  We've got some other formulas that we're coming up with
[1:40:42.360 --> 1:40:44.360]  As well, infowarslife.com
[1:40:44.360 --> 1:40:46.360]  Or triple-8, 2-5, 3-3-1, 3-9
[1:40:46.360 --> 1:40:48.360]  I coined the term
[1:40:48.360 --> 1:40:50.360]  Zomtrembioids
[1:40:50.360 --> 1:40:52.360]  They're artificially
[1:40:52.360 --> 1:40:54.360]  Arrested development
[1:40:54.360 --> 1:40:56.360]  They're very scared
[1:40:56.360 --> 1:40:58.360]  They don't normally go outside their houses a lot
[1:40:58.360 --> 1:41:00.360]  I like the Hank Hill episode
[1:41:00.360 --> 1:41:02.360]  Where Bobby talks about this kid that's on computers
[1:41:02.360 --> 1:41:04.360]  All the time, how much he loves him
[1:41:04.360 --> 1:41:06.360]  And he goes and opens the door and the kid actually has like green skin
[1:41:06.360 --> 1:41:08.360]  Like an alien
[1:41:08.360 --> 1:41:10.360]  There are folks every week I see that there's dying
[1:41:10.360 --> 1:41:12.360]  Staying up two, three days drinking
[1:41:12.360 --> 1:41:14.360]  Caffeine drinks
[1:41:14.360 --> 1:41:16.360]  Trying to play video games
[1:41:16.360 --> 1:41:18.360]  I mean, they're killing themselves for something that's a fantasy
[1:41:18.360 --> 1:41:20.360]  And I'm not knocking any of you play video games
[1:41:20.360 --> 1:41:22.360]  It's like, hey, do you have one glass of wine
[1:41:22.360 --> 1:41:24.360]  Or three bottles of wine
[1:41:24.360 --> 1:41:26.360]  Everything in moderation
[1:41:26.360 --> 1:41:28.360]  I play video games too sometimes
[1:41:28.360 --> 1:41:30.360]  I tend to go to an arcade or something and do it
[1:41:30.360 --> 1:41:32.360]  They kind of brought those back
[1:41:32.360 --> 1:41:34.360]  Like the old fashioned ones
[1:41:34.360 --> 1:41:36.360]  It's just that when it takes over your life
[1:41:36.360 --> 1:41:38.360]  It's an admitted false reality
[1:41:38.360 --> 1:41:40.360]  An alternate reality that you've been sucked into
[1:41:40.360 --> 1:41:42.360]  I know I'm pretty sure the choir are our regular audience
[1:41:42.360 --> 1:41:44.360]  But these are very, very important
[1:41:44.360 --> 1:41:46.360]  Issues we raise
[1:41:46.360 --> 1:41:48.360]  Separately, my patriots supply only started
[1:41:48.360 --> 1:41:50.360]  Eight years ago
[1:41:50.360 --> 1:41:52.360]  It's now the number one and number two largest
[1:41:52.360 --> 1:41:54.360]  Storeable foods company in the United States
[1:41:54.360 --> 1:41:56.360]  And why is that? Because they're high quality
[1:41:56.360 --> 1:41:58.360]  They bought up a lot of other big companies
[1:41:58.360 --> 1:42:00.360]  And they've got the lowest prices
[1:42:00.360 --> 1:42:02.360]  We sell their entire catalog every day up
[1:42:02.360 --> 1:42:04.360]  Bidded to whatever their latest specials are
[1:42:04.360 --> 1:42:06.360]  We drop ship right from Utah where they produce it
[1:42:06.360 --> 1:42:08.360]  When you do info or select
[1:42:08.360 --> 1:42:10.360]  I called them about three years ago and I said
[1:42:10.360 --> 1:42:12.360]  I want to go even below your best sales
[1:42:12.360 --> 1:42:14.360]  So I have to wait until they had sales to have sales in their contract
[1:42:14.360 --> 1:42:16.360]  And they said no
[1:42:16.360 --> 1:42:18.360]  And later I said I'm going to leave to another company
[1:42:18.360 --> 1:42:20.360]  Even though you're great, there's a few other good ones
[1:42:20.360 --> 1:42:22.360]  Because I want to sell stuff even lower and only make like 15% on this
[1:42:22.360 --> 1:42:24.360]  When I do a special
[1:42:24.360 --> 1:42:26.360]  And they said well we have deals with our other distributors
[1:42:26.360 --> 1:42:28.360]  And the only way is for you to private label
[1:42:28.360 --> 1:42:30.360]  Then you can contractually do it
[1:42:30.360 --> 1:42:32.360]  But they said we still want you to sign a contract
[1:42:32.360 --> 1:42:34.360]  Only do it twice a year
[1:42:34.360 --> 1:42:36.360]  Because Alex it's already so low priced
[1:42:36.360 --> 1:42:38.360]  And I said you know what
[1:42:38.360 --> 1:42:40.360]  I did it a few times
[1:42:40.360 --> 1:42:42.360]  Had the biggest sales I've ever had
[1:42:42.360 --> 1:42:44.360]  To help fund our operation
[1:42:44.360 --> 1:42:46.360]  That's a small profit per unit but it doesn't matter
[1:42:46.360 --> 1:42:48.360]  You get a great deal, you sell more
[1:42:48.360 --> 1:42:50.360]  Than it funds the operation
[1:42:50.360 --> 1:42:52.360]  Well I basically, these are great folks
[1:42:52.360 --> 1:42:54.360]  I've gotten them where I can do this every two months
[1:42:54.360 --> 1:42:56.360]  For only two days
[1:42:56.360 --> 1:42:58.360]  And I twist their arm for a couple extra days
[1:42:58.360 --> 1:43:00.360]  Until there are other distributors
[1:43:00.360 --> 1:43:02.360]  I'm sorry, I'm being greedy
[1:43:02.360 --> 1:43:04.360]  You should do what I'm doing
[1:43:04.360 --> 1:43:06.360]  You don't understand capitalism
[1:43:06.360 --> 1:43:08.360]  I'm able to do 30-40% off
[1:43:08.360 --> 1:43:10.360]  On the already discounted private label
[1:43:10.360 --> 1:43:12.360]  That's called import select made at the same time
[1:43:12.360 --> 1:43:14.360]  Full spectrum of food just 30-40% off
[1:43:16.360 --> 1:43:18.360]  The lowest special is 30% off
[1:43:18.360 --> 1:43:20.360]  So you know we're making like 15% on that
[1:43:20.360 --> 1:43:22.360]  And like 25%
[1:43:22.360 --> 1:43:24.360]  On the 40% off and that's enough to fund this
[1:43:24.360 --> 1:43:26.360]  When we dominate and sell a ton of it
[1:43:26.360 --> 1:43:28.360]  So it lasts 25 years is the best quality out there
[1:43:28.360 --> 1:43:30.360]  They got specialty foods
[1:43:30.360 --> 1:43:32.360]  Specialty diets, all sorts of great stuff
[1:43:32.360 --> 1:43:34.360]  It's amazing, it's insurance you can eat
[1:43:34.360 --> 1:43:36.360]  30-40% off, if you're thinking about it
[1:43:36.360 --> 1:43:38.360]  With North Korea threatening nuclear war
[1:43:38.360 --> 1:43:40.360]  And you know all these different European countries
[1:43:40.360 --> 1:43:42.360]  Activating their bomb shelters for war with Russia
[1:43:42.360 --> 1:43:44.360]  Knowing that the globalists may start a big war
[1:43:44.360 --> 1:43:46.360]  It's just smart to have this
[1:43:46.360 --> 1:43:48.360]  Show yourself sufficient
[1:43:48.360 --> 1:43:50.360]  And if things go south you've got real insurance
[1:43:50.360 --> 1:43:52.360]  You know FDIC insurance can't count on that
[1:43:52.360 --> 1:43:54.360]  With your bank accounts, can't count on insurance
[1:43:54.360 --> 1:43:56.360]  And stuff really goes bad, they call it act of God
[1:43:56.360 --> 1:43:58.360]  A storeable food
[1:43:58.360 --> 1:44:00.360]  And stuff like that is something you can use
[1:44:00.360 --> 1:44:02.360]  A shotgun or rifle and a four wheel drive
[1:44:02.360 --> 1:44:04.360]  I live back in the woods you see
[1:44:04.360 --> 1:44:06.360]  One of the dogs, the kids and me
[1:44:06.360 --> 1:44:08.360]  So
[1:44:08.360 --> 1:44:10.360]  This is something good for everybody to have
[1:44:10.360 --> 1:44:12.360]  When I got a cabin out in the woods full of this stuff
[1:44:12.360 --> 1:44:14.360]  And my house right in town has got it as well
[1:44:14.360 --> 1:44:16.360]  I'm not living in fear
[1:44:16.360 --> 1:44:18.360]  I'm living
[1:44:18.360 --> 1:44:20.360]  Like a man who's supposed to be
[1:44:20.360 --> 1:44:22.360]  Prepared and ready for his family
[1:44:22.360 --> 1:44:24.360]  I don't wear a 9mm on my hip now
[1:44:24.360 --> 1:44:26.360]  Cause I'm living in fear
[1:44:26.360 --> 1:44:28.360]  I'm gonna not sit there and just totally roll over
[1:44:28.360 --> 1:44:30.360]  And we're in a dangerous climate now
[1:44:30.360 --> 1:44:32.360]  So for the first time in my life I'm carrying a handgun
[1:44:32.360 --> 1:44:34.360]  Pretty much all the time
[1:44:36.360 --> 1:44:38.360]  Cause I can't just be macho
[1:44:38.360 --> 1:44:40.360]  And roll over if somebody wants to kill me
[1:44:40.360 --> 1:44:42.360]  The message is too important
[1:44:42.360 --> 1:44:44.360]  I gotta do whatever I can to protect myself
[1:44:44.360 --> 1:44:46.360]  So I'm there for my children
[1:44:46.360 --> 1:44:48.360]  Also the new Defender Body Armor
[1:44:48.360 --> 1:44:50.360]  Adopted by the Defense Department
[1:44:50.360 --> 1:44:52.360]  The best plastic slash Kevlar
[1:44:52.360 --> 1:44:54.360]  There is
[1:44:54.360 --> 1:44:56.360]  No reviews yet because we just started selling it
[1:44:56.360 --> 1:44:58.360]  From other products, backpack inserts
[1:44:58.360 --> 1:45:00.360]  The plates
[1:45:00.360 --> 1:45:02.360]  The vests to wear it in
[1:45:02.360 --> 1:45:04.360]  It's the best system
[1:45:04.360 --> 1:45:06.360]  You get the same price you get at Defender
[1:45:06.360 --> 1:45:08.360]  And it makes everything we do here possible
[1:45:08.360 --> 1:45:10.360]  So please shop with the good guys
[1:45:10.360 --> 1:45:12.360]  Defender Body Armor
[1:45:12.360 --> 1:45:14.360]  InfoWarsLife.com
[1:45:14.360 --> 1:45:16.360]  InfoWarsStore.com
[1:45:16.360 --> 1:45:18.360]  Now it's about a third as thick
[1:45:18.360 --> 1:45:20.360]  That stops rifle rounds
[1:45:20.360 --> 1:45:22.360]  But we were shooting it with rifle rounds
[1:45:22.360 --> 1:45:24.360]  And with 500
[1:45:24.360 --> 1:45:26.360]  The handgun round there is
[1:45:26.360 --> 1:45:28.360]  And it didn't go through it
[1:45:28.360 --> 1:45:30.360]  So it's joke level
[1:45:30.360 --> 1:45:32.360]  How good it is
[1:45:32.360 --> 1:45:34.360]  We also have the nano tech developed in Texas
[1:45:34.360 --> 1:45:36.360]  Manufactured in America
[1:45:36.360 --> 1:45:38.360]  It's built out in New Mexico
[1:45:38.360 --> 1:45:40.360]  That is just as good
[1:45:40.360 --> 1:45:42.360]  For the similar price
[1:45:42.360 --> 1:45:44.360]  Maybe a tad bit more
[1:45:44.360 --> 1:45:46.360]  And there we are shooting it with a Smith & Wesson 500
[1:45:46.360 --> 1:45:48.360]  I knocked a buffalo over one of those
[1:45:48.360 --> 1:45:50.360]  Oh yeah, you can still hunt buffalo
[1:45:50.360 --> 1:45:52.360]  I'll show you the 500
[1:45:52.360 --> 1:45:54.360]  Every month
[1:45:54.360 --> 1:45:56.360]  You go to a conservation place
[1:45:56.360 --> 1:45:58.360]  Where they produce buffalo to put them out in the open range
[1:45:58.360 --> 1:46:00.360]  And by hunting some and producing beef from them
[1:46:00.360 --> 1:46:02.360]  It then helps them fund the operation
[1:46:02.360 --> 1:46:04.360]  To re-wild areas
[1:46:04.360 --> 1:46:06.360]  And put buffalo out in areas of Montana
[1:46:06.360 --> 1:46:08.360]  Colorado open range
[1:46:08.360 --> 1:46:10.360]  So the average leftist is like
[1:46:10.360 --> 1:46:12.360]  How dare you hunt a buffalo they are almost extinct
[1:46:12.360 --> 1:46:14.360]  How about using hunting and then harvesting the beef
[1:46:14.360 --> 1:46:16.360]  To get high quality lean beef
[1:46:16.360 --> 1:46:18.360]  It's bovine and then
[1:46:18.360 --> 1:46:20.360]  One buffalo you end up killing
[1:46:20.360 --> 1:46:22.360]  More than 10
[1:46:22.360 --> 1:46:24.360]  The place I go hunting sometimes is 8,000 acres
[1:46:24.360 --> 1:46:26.360]  Has sheep and things
[1:46:26.360 --> 1:46:28.360]  Big horned sheep that are in Europe
[1:46:28.360 --> 1:46:30.360]  That were only a couple hundred left a few years ago
[1:46:30.360 --> 1:46:32.360]  They ended up getting them now there's thousands all over the world
[1:46:32.360 --> 1:46:34.360]  So you hunt one it's got a high dollar on it
[1:46:34.360 --> 1:46:36.360]  And you're actually funding conservation
[1:46:36.360 --> 1:46:38.360]  To then put them back
[1:46:38.360 --> 1:46:40.360]  In Europe and other areas
[1:46:40.360 --> 1:46:42.360]  I think I sort of have that particular type
[1:46:42.360 --> 1:46:44.360]  I forget the name it's like a Ural sheep
[1:46:44.360 --> 1:46:46.360]  Or some Caspian sheep
[1:46:46.360 --> 1:46:48.360]  And you shoot it and then
[1:46:48.360 --> 1:46:50.360]  Set them all the world and repopulate them
[1:46:50.360 --> 1:46:52.360]  But now there's a bigger population
[1:46:52.360 --> 1:46:54.360]  In the US they were like 15,000 or something
[1:46:54.360 --> 1:46:56.360]  Then there are back in the mountains
[1:46:56.360 --> 1:46:58.360]  Of Eastern Europe it's just crazy how it works
[1:46:58.360 --> 1:47:00.360]  But that's the type of hunting I do
[1:47:00.360 --> 1:47:02.360]  And
[1:47:02.360 --> 1:47:04.360]  It's amazing
[1:47:04.360 --> 1:47:06.360]  It's amazing
[1:47:06.360 --> 1:47:08.360]  The conservation that is involved
[1:47:08.360 --> 1:47:10.360]  And just how ignorant the left is
[1:47:10.360 --> 1:47:12.360]  We got more white-tailed deer in Texas
[1:47:12.360 --> 1:47:14.360]  Than we had a hundred years ago
[1:47:14.360 --> 1:47:16.360]  Because of the conservation
[1:47:16.360 --> 1:47:18.360]  And the money that goes back in
[1:47:18.360 --> 1:47:20.360]  To producing better genetics in them
[1:47:20.360 --> 1:47:22.360]  I'm digressing, I'm sorry
[1:47:22.360 --> 1:47:24.360]  I'm going to go off on a whole other subject
[1:47:24.360 --> 1:47:26.360]  Talk about real eugenics
[1:47:26.360 --> 1:47:28.360]  That's going on with the production of the fish
[1:47:28.360 --> 1:47:30.360]  The production of the deer
[1:47:30.360 --> 1:47:32.360]  The Texas Parks and Wildlife has a lot of little commies
[1:47:32.360 --> 1:47:34.360]  That are at the low level but high level
[1:47:34.360 --> 1:47:36.360]  They got some good people that know what they're doing
[1:47:36.360 --> 1:47:38.360]  Oh yeah I can go hunt white-tailed
[1:47:38.360 --> 1:47:40.360]  Basically you're around if I want to
[1:47:40.360 --> 1:47:42.360]  But there's a big price tag on it for conservation
[1:47:42.360 --> 1:47:44.360]  To then produce even more and better
[1:47:44.360 --> 1:47:46.360]  People say well why do you want to go hunt white-tailed
[1:47:46.360 --> 1:47:48.360]  I don't have antlers on them
[1:47:48.360 --> 1:47:50.360]  I don't go hunt them with the antlers
[1:47:50.360 --> 1:47:52.360]  I don't care about the big trophy
[1:47:52.360 --> 1:47:54.360]  I want to shoot a young doe
[1:47:54.360 --> 1:47:56.360]  Because then I get that great healthy meat
[1:47:56.360 --> 1:47:58.360]  That can make stews out of steaks
[1:47:58.360 --> 1:48:00.360]  You name it
[1:48:00.360 --> 1:48:02.360]  If you're shooting some big buck in the rut
[1:48:02.360 --> 1:48:04.360]  The big old antlers that doesn't taste good
[1:48:04.360 --> 1:48:06.360]  Little newsflash everybody
[1:48:06.360 --> 1:48:08.360]  But I am now digressing ladies and gentlemen
[1:48:08.360 --> 1:48:10.360]  Into just basic primitive activity
[1:48:10.360 --> 1:48:12.360]  Which when you do these primitive activities
[1:48:12.360 --> 1:48:14.360]  It opens up all these pathways in your brains
[1:48:14.360 --> 1:48:17.360]  All these instincts they've been trying to suppress
[1:48:17.360 --> 1:48:21.360]  It's amazing how they've put us in this artificial bubble
[1:48:21.360 --> 1:48:23.360]  Alright
[1:48:23.360 --> 1:48:25.360]  So I've already spent an hour and
[1:48:25.360 --> 1:48:27.360]  48 minutes
[1:48:27.360 --> 1:48:29.360]  On the epically huge
[1:48:29.360 --> 1:48:31.360]  Announcement
[1:48:32.360 --> 1:48:34.360]  That Rand Paul's a Russian agent
[1:48:34.360 --> 1:48:35.360]  I'm a Russian agent
[1:48:35.360 --> 1:48:43.360]  I'm under investigation of being a Russian agent
[1:48:43.360 --> 1:48:45.360]  That just shows how desperate they are
[1:48:45.360 --> 1:48:49.360]  But here's the 64 trillion dollar answer
[1:48:49.360 --> 1:48:51.360]  They know the public isn't buying
[1:48:51.360 --> 1:48:53.360]  And they made a big joke about it
[1:48:53.360 --> 1:48:55.360]  That all the patriots won because the Russians did it
[1:48:55.360 --> 1:48:57.360]  Or Rockefeller died because the Russians
[1:48:57.360 --> 1:48:59.360]  Or Hillary fell down because the Russians
[1:48:59.360 --> 1:49:01.360]  Or there was bad weather because the Russians
[1:49:01.360 --> 1:49:03.360]  Or my tire went flat because the Russians
[1:49:03.360 --> 1:49:05.360]  They know nobody's buying it
[1:49:05.360 --> 1:49:07.360]  They don't care
[1:49:07.360 --> 1:49:09.360]  That's the excuse with the people
[1:49:09.360 --> 1:49:11.360]  In the deep state, in the shadow government
[1:49:11.360 --> 1:49:13.360]  Just the bureaucracy ignoring the law
[1:49:13.360 --> 1:49:15.360]  And the president to then run around
[1:49:15.360 --> 1:49:17.360]  And prepare for his political overthrow
[1:49:17.360 --> 1:49:19.360]  And to leak information to the media
[1:49:19.360 --> 1:49:21.360]  And then admit they leak it
[1:49:21.360 --> 1:49:23.360]  Then deny they leak it and say Trump's crazy
[1:49:23.360 --> 1:49:25.360]  And it's been discredited
[1:49:25.360 --> 1:49:27.360]  But other than this healthcare deal
[1:49:27.360 --> 1:49:29.360]  Which I know they came to Trump and they said
[1:49:29.360 --> 1:49:30.360]  The economy's gonna implode
[1:49:30.360 --> 1:49:32.360]  It's meant to kill the economy this year
[1:49:32.360 --> 1:49:34.360]  They don't repeal it at least
[1:49:34.360 --> 1:49:36.360]  And have some quasi-system
[1:49:36.360 --> 1:49:38.360]  It's gonna go crazy
[1:49:38.360 --> 1:49:40.360]  And so he's listened to Paul Ryan
[1:49:40.360 --> 1:49:42.360]  It's Trump's first mistake
[1:49:42.360 --> 1:49:44.360]  And I think part of the new Gallup poll that's so low
[1:49:44.360 --> 1:49:46.360]  Is fake, just like during the campaign it was fake
[1:49:46.360 --> 1:49:48.360]  We told you it was fake
[1:49:48.360 --> 1:49:50.360]  But you know, I'd say a third of his drop
[1:49:50.360 --> 1:49:52.360]  Is real because it's the first time
[1:49:52.360 --> 1:49:54.360]  He's deviated from his absolute promise
[1:49:54.360 --> 1:49:56.360]  To repeal Obamacare
[1:49:56.360 --> 1:49:58.360]  I know he's gonna hear everybody bitching
[1:49:58.360 --> 1:50:00.360]  And saying a bunch of poor people don't have healthcare
[1:50:00.360 --> 1:50:02.360]  Talk to medical experts, they get it under charity care
[1:50:02.360 --> 1:50:04.360]  They're not being told
[1:50:04.360 --> 1:50:06.360]  The illegal aliens know there's charity care
[1:50:06.360 --> 1:50:08.360]  They know you can't be turned away under law
[1:50:08.360 --> 1:50:10.360]  But citizens play along
[1:50:10.360 --> 1:50:12.360]  That we're not supposed to get something for free
[1:50:12.360 --> 1:50:14.360]  I'm not for stuff for free
[1:50:14.360 --> 1:50:16.360]  But if it's there and already free
[1:50:16.360 --> 1:50:18.360]  Then go get it
[1:50:18.360 --> 1:50:20.360]  Of course now
[1:50:20.360 --> 1:50:22.360]  It's up to 50% from 37
[1:50:22.360 --> 1:50:24.360]  They just put these things out
[1:50:24.360 --> 1:50:26.360]  To bully the president ladies and gentlemen
[1:50:26.360 --> 1:50:28.360]  And he shouldn't follow any of the polls
[1:50:28.360 --> 1:50:30.360]  I want to take your calls on
[1:50:30.360 --> 1:50:32.360]  Where do you see this going, how do we counter this
[1:50:32.360 --> 1:50:34.360]  They wouldn't be confident putting this out
[1:50:34.360 --> 1:50:36.360]  Unless they're planning military action
[1:50:36.360 --> 1:50:38.360]  Clearly they're planning false flags
[1:50:38.360 --> 1:50:40.360]  To demonize the president
[1:50:40.360 --> 1:50:42.360]  What would those be, we should talk about it
[1:50:42.360 --> 1:50:44.360]  And clearly they're planning probes, bomb attacks
[1:50:44.360 --> 1:50:46.360]  Blueprints of Trump Tower, other things
[1:50:46.360 --> 1:50:48.360]  Try to kill the president
[1:50:48.360 --> 1:50:50.360]  We're in a war, a civil war for the republic
[1:50:50.360 --> 1:50:52.360]  The globalists that have hijacked the country
[1:50:52.360 --> 1:50:54.360]  Are the enemy, they are the foreign power
[1:50:54.360 --> 1:50:56.360]  And we've got to rally
[1:50:56.360 --> 1:50:58.360]  The American people against it
[1:51:26.360 --> 1:51:28.360]  We use cell phones against our heads every day
[1:51:28.360 --> 1:51:30.360]  But now a landmark US government study

[1:57:45.360 --> 1:57:51.120]  You see the globalists know that we adapt to being killed. We adapt to being poisoned as long as we're shown
[1:57:51.120 --> 1:57:55.940]  It's okay. So like everybody's got breast cancer and brain cancer now all the kids are starting to get cancer. It's okay
[1:57:56.760 --> 1:57:59.360]  Pediatric cancer over 10,000 percent less. It's okay
[1:58:00.200 --> 1:58:01.560]  It's okay
[1:58:01.560 --> 1:58:06.360]  Just we're all in this together. All right when you get a vodka, you know, give it extra dollar

[1:58:12.280 --> 1:58:14.280]  How about why everybody's getting the cancer?
[1:58:14.280 --> 1:58:16.280]  So see they normalize it. Oh
[1:58:17.080 --> 1:58:20.000]  You're your brain damage now. It's okay
[1:58:21.360 --> 1:58:25.080]  Zuckerberg and everybody needs the earth cleansed of you to enjoy the new future
[1:58:25.960 --> 1:58:30.680]  None of them have screen time none of them are allowed to watch television. None of their children like
[1:58:31.400 --> 1:58:38.600]  Steve Jobs are allowed to be online or have an iPad. They don't take vaccines either. But you and your children do
[1:58:38.600 --> 1:58:44.920]  Do the right thing kill yourself and your children for big pharma. The earth belongs to them
[1:58:45.640 --> 1:58:46.840]  submit

[1:58:59.560 --> 1:59:05.200]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science one of our oldest sponsors
[1:59:05.200 --> 1:59:09.120]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful
[1:59:09.120 --> 1:59:14.440]  You can run some 110 appliances at your house like a small refrigerator so you can keep food from spoiling
[1:59:14.520 --> 1:59:19.840]  Plus you can take it with you to jumpstart cars trucks buses 18 wheelers heavy equipment even airplanes
[1:59:19.960 --> 1:59:25.400]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity allowing you to create your own private power grid
[1:59:25.640 --> 1:59:31.880]  Literally anywhere in the world perfect for cabins remote locations any time you need to get off the grid for a while

[2:00:04.720 --> 2:00:07.280]  Big brother mainstream media
[2:00:08.080 --> 2:00:10.600]  Government cover-ups you want answers?
[2:00:10.600 --> 2:00:19.200]  Well, so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas
[2:00:20.200 --> 2:00:22.200]  Alex Jones
[2:00:29.440 --> 2:00:35.960]  Humans not having empathy not caring not wondering why there's so many brain damage children somebody gets dying and mentally from vaccines
[2:00:35.960 --> 2:00:41.200]  Is what allows this to happen with the articles on drugs report police Chicago team gang raped on Facebook live
[2:00:41.720 --> 2:00:43.720]  40 viewers cops not called
[2:00:46.560 --> 2:00:48.760]  That's what allows scumbags
[2:00:49.800 --> 2:00:57.480]  Like Pelosi and Maxine waters to keep screwing everybody over our weakness is what empowers them
[2:00:57.480 --> 2:01:10.560]  Now that the Democrats and Republicans announced smaller tax cuts as Trump battles the stock market starts turning down see as soon as Trump began to compromise on health care
[2:01:10.960 --> 2:01:14.720]  The magic ended only the purity was what was invincible
[2:01:21.840 --> 2:01:26.360]  I mean Trump's light years better than Hillary it's just and I understand he wants to stabilize the economy
[2:01:26.360 --> 2:01:32.600]  But wow back to Sesame Street reduces autistic Muppet after Elmo tells you to go out get vaccinated

[2:01:50.720 --> 2:02:07.760]  Oh, that actually didn't kill you too bad. Oh, you can't talk you did what I told you I talk like I'm John ill
[2:02:09.600 --> 2:02:12.080]  Now it's Baldwin. You've been very useful to me
[2:02:12.080 --> 2:02:19.520]  Oh, we can play side by side like we do sometimes my chemical weapon did good
[2:02:23.480 --> 2:02:26.200]  She does she doesn't find out why she's brain damaged
[2:02:27.520 --> 2:02:29.520]  She did what he said
[2:02:31.280 --> 2:02:33.280]  Guy was armed in the puppet
[2:02:33.960 --> 2:02:36.640]  It's a man trying to get your kids to go along with something
[2:02:36.640 --> 2:02:42.080]  That's creepy. Oh, look, I'm a I'm a toy
[2:02:43.080 --> 2:02:45.080]  Sesame Street pervert street
[2:02:45.080 --> 2:03:01.800]  So you'll all be like that to me. Oh, you all down machine guns with a new world order
[2:03:01.800 --> 2:03:16.360]  Oh, that's sweet. Oh, we need to fund that with taxpayer money, isn't it cute get vaccinated with a surgeon general and Elmo
[2:03:16.360 --> 2:03:18.760]  Let's let's have a flashback of this filth. Here it is
[2:03:24.280 --> 2:03:27.920]  I'm the surgeon general Elmo. It's my job to help everyone stay healthy
[2:03:27.920 --> 2:03:35.920]  Absolutely Elmo, you can get all your vaccinations on time. Those are the shots that help you stay healthy shots
[2:03:36.720 --> 2:03:39.320]  Don't worry. Elmo. It's just a little pinch and it's safe
[2:03:41.640 --> 2:03:45.120]  And tell all your friends on Sesame Street to get vaccinated to
[2:03:47.760 --> 2:03:55.760]  It's safe they always say safe and effective read the insert every vaccine says it can kill you cause neurological disorders
[2:03:55.760 --> 2:04:00.120]  You know, it doesn't matter though. He lied. He said Elmo. It's safe
[2:04:02.720 --> 2:04:08.000]  Isn't it cute and we all do it Bill Gates says because his dad ran Planned Parenthood
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:14.520]  It was a top eugenicist and the head of the eugenics society in the US and he helped with his people set up the Kaiser Villa Institute
[2:04:14.840 --> 2:04:18.240]  And you know how nice they were. I mean, you know how Hitler
[2:04:19.640 --> 2:04:23.440]  But then if you're actually fighting it you see you're with Hitler
[2:04:23.440 --> 2:04:30.560]  If you're actually against George Soros like the forward said a few weeks ago, Alex loves Hitler no quote no link
[2:04:31.360 --> 2:04:33.360]  Doesn't matter. I love Hitler
[2:04:34.080 --> 2:04:36.320]  No, it's you that love
[2:04:39.360 --> 2:04:43.680]  Those that created Hitler as a trap destroy the German people
[2:04:46.640 --> 2:04:49.680]  Shame on shame on all you people
[2:04:49.680 --> 2:04:54.640]  Shame on all you people. You know where you're going, don't you? The same place today the Rockefeller is even now
[2:04:59.680 --> 2:05:07.680]  Judge Neil Gorsuch gave his opening statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee Monday on the first day of hearings on his nomination to the U.S.
[2:05:07.680 --> 2:05:08.880]  Supreme Court in it
[2:05:08.880 --> 2:05:16.880]  He unpacked his views on the job of unelected judges in a democratic republic giving his personal story and pledging to be a public
[2:05:16.880 --> 2:05:23.040]  Servant who faithfully follows the Constitution and the laws enacted by the people's elected representatives
[2:05:23.280 --> 2:05:25.680]  Judging is sometimes a lonely and hard job
[2:05:25.920 --> 2:05:34.080]  Gorsuch mused in a wide ranging speech that ranged from the dramatic to the humorous to reflections at times showing deep passion
[2:05:34.160 --> 2:05:36.720]  And on two occasions even getting emotional
[2:05:36.960 --> 2:05:43.760]  Today Gorsuch sparred with Feinstein as well as other senators as they grilled him on his policies
[2:05:43.760 --> 2:05:48.800]  It looks like that we're going to have a supreme court judge just like Antonin Scalia
[2:05:49.120 --> 2:05:55.920]  Stay tuned to the alex stone show at info wars.com slash show to follow the senate hearings

[2:06:34.240 --> 2:06:41.040]  But you use the bones for strength from the outside structure full of minerals and kiko factors to the marrow
[2:06:41.120 --> 2:06:45.040]  That produces the blood for the body. This is the engine of the life essence

[2:08:19.280 --> 2:08:39.760]  So 12 years ago they began Gardasil trials in the united states and they had a bunch of deaths across the country of
[2:08:39.760 --> 2:08:44.160]  Autoimmune disorders of 11 and 12 year old girls that were being evident
[2:08:44.160 --> 2:08:50.400]  It was just all over local news hundreds of deaths so they couldn't get it approved until rick perry then governor announced
[2:08:50.400 --> 2:08:55.200]  It was an emergency so under federal law if even a state governor announces an emergency
[2:08:55.600 --> 2:09:01.200]  It gives it vaccine liability protection and that multi-billion dollar fund that was set up in 1983
[2:09:03.520 --> 2:09:07.840]  And so I sat there and watched that with horror every week seeing more deaths
[2:09:07.840 --> 2:09:14.560]  And you read the vaccine pieces of paper the the inserts that come with the actual ampoule
[2:09:15.200 --> 2:09:21.360]  And and they always tell the news safe and effective. They'll say it the different clinics you go to or the different drug stores
[2:09:21.600 --> 2:09:26.320]  Oh, that's a conspiracy theory. It's safe and effective. Maybe a sore injection site
[2:09:27.760 --> 2:09:35.600]  Then you read the mmr or flu vaccine or hepatitis vaccine or any of them and it's like neurological disorders narcolepsy
[2:09:35.600 --> 2:09:38.480]  Uh type 1 diabetes by destroying your pancreas
[2:09:38.960 --> 2:09:42.240]  Uh death, uh autoimmune disorders. I mean, it's like
[2:09:43.040 --> 2:09:48.160]  Small print too giant. It's size of a poster and it's just small print like bible paper
[2:09:49.360 --> 2:09:53.920]  In fact, I've got the file in there since we're on the subject now since you guys raised this elmo piece
[2:09:54.480 --> 2:09:58.720]  I've got my vaccine file because people bring that in. I'll just show the mmr where it says it can kill you
[2:09:58.960 --> 2:10:01.440]  neurological disorders, but they have the surgeon general
[2:10:01.440 --> 2:10:05.840]  So with elmo saying kids is totally safe. Get your vaccines
[2:10:07.040 --> 2:10:09.760]  Well, it's four or five 30 years ago. Now. It's 50 something
[2:10:11.360 --> 2:10:14.880]  And it's directly link all of the world to death. You name it neurological disorders
[2:10:15.200 --> 2:10:18.240]  autoimmune responses is tainted with cancer viruses. You name it
[2:10:19.680 --> 2:10:21.680]  But he just says safe and effective
[2:10:22.640 --> 2:10:25.440]  In fact, he says it's just completely safe some creepy dude
[2:10:25.440 --> 2:10:31.360]  Well, that was a few years ago. Now. They've got thank you. Now. They've got
[2:10:31.840 --> 2:10:33.840]  The new autistic
[2:10:35.440 --> 2:10:37.440]  Uh elmo kid that can't talk
[2:10:38.400 --> 2:10:40.400]  Now there's bombshell cdc
[2:10:40.400 --> 2:10:44.400]  Commits a new vaccine autism crime. Let's go over this here. This is a
[2:10:45.600 --> 2:10:50.880]  Do a document cam shot for tv viewers radio listeners. I'll read it to you. This is a merc and co ink from
[2:10:52.240 --> 2:10:53.920]  one of their vaccines
[2:10:53.920 --> 2:10:56.960]  Now you go to the drugstore and say is is there any side effects? No, none
[2:10:57.440 --> 2:10:59.920]  Safe and effective. They'll give you a fake fact sheet
[2:11:00.480 --> 2:11:05.120]  You need to ask with what comes with the ampule the actual paper any drug has this under law
[2:11:05.520 --> 2:11:07.520]  They're trying to pass a law to get rid of these
[2:11:08.400 --> 2:11:10.400]  And it says
[2:11:13.280 --> 2:11:16.240]  Basically here what it can do to you
[2:11:18.800 --> 2:11:22.960]  And what is inside of the vaccine and i'm telling you it is a
[2:11:22.960 --> 2:11:29.520]  It is a long hard read pancreatitis. That's what kills your pancreas diarrhea vomiting
[2:11:30.640 --> 2:11:32.640]  nausea endocrine system
[2:11:34.080 --> 2:11:38.400]  Diabetes so then it just kills your pancreas it gives you diabetes and the kids get the shot
[2:11:38.400 --> 2:11:43.600]  They wonder why their pancreas fails and then you wonder why the clinics is full of the kids always at around august 15th
[2:11:43.840 --> 2:11:47.760]  The clinics fill up nationwide because you're you're you're your pancreas is a dying or a few weeks later
[2:11:49.360 --> 2:11:51.360]  Here let's read some more here
[2:11:51.360 --> 2:11:53.360]  Steven johnson syndrome
[2:11:56.240 --> 2:11:58.240]  Arethmia
[2:11:59.360 --> 2:12:04.960]  Measles like rash because it gives you measles you take the measles vaccine you get measles you take the shingles vaccines
[2:12:04.960 --> 2:12:07.680]  You get it, but it's like this to a bill in the gates have
[2:12:08.320 --> 2:12:12.880]  60,000 here 100,000 there a half million here in some avricant country or in in india
[2:12:13.520 --> 2:12:18.560]  They say oh, they had polio like symptoms and thousands of children died
[2:12:18.560 --> 2:12:22.320]  But she's a minor footnote because bill them on the gates are so wonderful
[2:12:22.960 --> 2:12:26.640]  Like my grandma getting polio after the vaccine. It's so wonderful
[2:12:30.560 --> 2:12:32.880]  And it goes on and on here you can just read
[2:12:36.080 --> 2:12:40.880]  All the brain damage neurological disorders it just goes on and on. I mean I can just all day read these two if you'd like
[2:12:40.880 --> 2:12:46.880]  Tell us I feel like this is just all I should do on air actually. Oh, Alex Jones. It's fake news. He says vaccines are bad
[2:12:47.360 --> 2:12:50.160]  You can actually read all the stuff influenza vaccine all of it
[2:12:51.520 --> 2:12:53.520]  Brain damage narcolepsy death
[2:12:55.760 --> 2:13:02.560]  Yep, Gardasil linked to deaths and diabetes after young girls vaccinated for ontostar. Yeah, it turns off your immune system
[2:13:03.120 --> 2:13:07.280]  Gardasil doesn't protect against any of the cancer viruses. It is cancer viruses
[2:13:07.280 --> 2:13:09.280]  That's a fact jack
[2:13:12.320 --> 2:13:14.320]  I laugh because it's so sick
[2:13:16.320 --> 2:13:20.320]  Chris and Beth and Carlos and Michelle and Lex I'm gonna go to your calls
[2:13:21.200 --> 2:13:24.320]  If you just joined us it's in the mclatchie you name it everywhere
[2:13:26.160 --> 2:13:31.200]  Alex Jones and impor's bright part under investigation for ties to russia
[2:13:32.000 --> 2:13:34.000]  I can't believe I'm in a hospital
[2:13:34.000 --> 2:13:36.580]  That's apart under investigation for ties to russia
[2:13:38.240 --> 2:13:40.640]  Counter espionage investigation of the fbi
[2:13:41.360 --> 2:13:45.120]  that we may be actually getting commands from russia
[2:13:46.000 --> 2:13:50.400]  Because we want control our borders cut our taxes have our guns our private property
[2:13:51.440 --> 2:13:56.560]  We want trump to investigate the vaccines which he's announcing. We are horrible, horrible, horrible people
[2:13:57.760 --> 2:14:02.160]  And the word is again Trump's this big russian agent too. And so is Rand Paul
[2:14:02.160 --> 2:14:05.240]  You know what's funny?
[2:14:05.240 --> 2:14:07.440]  Rand Paul is only on the show when he calls me to come on.
[2:14:07.440 --> 2:14:10.920]  He's got to tell his staff he wants to go on.
[2:14:10.920 --> 2:14:15.600]  Not that I even need Rand Paul on the show, but he'll ask, why I've been on the show
[2:14:15.600 --> 2:14:16.600]  in years?
[2:14:16.600 --> 2:14:17.600]  What's going on?
[2:14:17.600 --> 2:14:23.840]  One time I got asked by one of his family members, hey, Rand's wondering why you never
[2:14:23.840 --> 2:14:24.840]  call him.
[2:14:24.840 --> 2:14:25.840]  Your people ignore us.
[2:14:25.840 --> 2:14:29.680]  It's not only we need Rand Paul on the show, but, you know, he's being called a Russian
[2:14:29.680 --> 2:14:32.320]  agent, so am I now, Tucker Carlson.
[2:14:32.320 --> 2:14:34.840]  And we call their people and they just don't even return our phone call.
[2:14:34.840 --> 2:14:37.920]  So I'm going to hang with Senator Rand Paul right now.
[2:14:37.920 --> 2:14:42.040]  Last time I mentioned this, he called a day later and it was like, it was the same thing
[2:14:42.040 --> 2:14:43.040]  with a Ted Nugent.
[2:14:43.040 --> 2:14:46.880]  I mean, I've got a cell phone number in his email, but I'm supposed to call his booker.
[2:14:46.880 --> 2:14:47.880]  He literally calls me once.
[2:14:47.880 --> 2:14:48.880]  I haven't been on the show.
[2:14:48.880 --> 2:14:49.880]  Why don't you ever call?
[2:14:49.880 --> 2:14:53.040]  I mean, your people don't get back with Nico Acosta.
[2:14:53.040 --> 2:14:56.960]  But I want Senator Rand Paul on the show about this and what do we do about this?
[2:14:56.960 --> 2:14:58.480]  He came on a few weeks ago about the healthcare bill.
[2:14:58.480 --> 2:14:59.480]  He's absolutely right.
[2:14:59.480 --> 2:15:00.480]  That's a good idea.
[2:15:00.480 --> 2:15:03.320]  Better than Obamacare, but that doesn't mean something's like being shot with a bazooka
[2:15:03.320 --> 2:15:04.320]  or a 45.
[2:15:04.320 --> 2:15:05.560]  I don't want to be shot by either.
[2:15:05.560 --> 2:15:08.120]  I want this damn thing repealed.
[2:15:08.120 --> 2:15:14.120]  But that's just an example of the demonization that's going on.
[2:15:14.120 --> 2:15:16.240]  I've got a bunch of news in the economy, military.
[2:15:16.240 --> 2:15:20.480]  I want to get to Paul Watson's house in the fourth hour from London, England right now.
[2:15:20.480 --> 2:15:24.360]  Let's talk to a caller in Canada.
[2:15:24.360 --> 2:15:26.040]  Let's go ahead and talk to Carlos.
[2:15:26.040 --> 2:15:27.040]  You're on the air.
[2:15:27.040 --> 2:15:28.040]  Thanks for holding.
[2:15:28.040 --> 2:15:30.360]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:15:30.360 --> 2:15:36.640]  Before I give you a bit of a solution to this Russian malarkey that's going on and the allegations
[2:15:36.640 --> 2:15:41.080]  against yourself and others, I want to tell you we've got some of your iodine product.
[2:15:41.080 --> 2:15:43.560]  That is really great stuff.
[2:15:43.560 --> 2:15:48.160]  And we should advise everyone who's listening to get it, it should be part of your medicine
[2:15:48.160 --> 2:15:49.160]  cabinet.
[2:15:49.160 --> 2:15:50.160]  People love testimonials.
[2:15:50.160 --> 2:15:52.360]  What did it do for you?
[2:15:52.360 --> 2:15:59.400]  Well, it's actually very solitary because we run down on iodine and it's something
[2:15:59.400 --> 2:16:03.240]  that people don't realize in western and northern latitudes.
[2:16:03.240 --> 2:16:09.720]  And unless you're taking vitamin D3 and you're really getting all the components, don't forget
[2:16:09.720 --> 2:16:15.160]  iodine comes from the ocean and that's essential to all the living cells in our body.
[2:16:15.160 --> 2:16:21.360]  So if you don't have it, you die and the other iodines are just toxic or they're bound.
[2:16:21.360 --> 2:16:28.120]  This is real 999999, deep earth, not ocean-based, goes right into the blood and it's in a palm
[2:16:28.120 --> 2:16:30.320]  oil organic system.
[2:16:30.320 --> 2:16:31.440]  It's a speak of the devil.
[2:16:31.440 --> 2:16:36.520]  It's Russian patented technology, how they inject the gas in, but it's pretty amazing.
[2:16:36.520 --> 2:16:42.040]  All right, now let me tell you how you can forge them on their own patard.
[2:16:42.040 --> 2:16:48.000]  For about a year now, there's been, there was talk along about that time of a movement
[2:16:48.000 --> 2:16:53.120]  to get rid of not President Trump because he wasn't at that time believed that he was
[2:16:53.120 --> 2:16:58.240]  going to be president, but the target was Vladimir Putin.
[2:16:58.240 --> 2:17:04.320]  He's going to be running again for election next year in the month of March, a year from
[2:17:04.320 --> 2:17:05.400]  now.
[2:17:05.400 --> 2:17:13.120]  And the plan was to mount a tremendous campaign with trouble from Ukraine so that there would
[2:17:13.120 --> 2:17:19.280]  be infiltrations, terrorism, and new candidates very strongly supported by the neocons.
[2:17:19.280 --> 2:17:24.680]  And by the way, McCain and Soros and Hillary and Obama admitted that they have groups by
[2:17:24.680 --> 2:17:29.880]  the thousands of groups in Russia openly trying to overthrow their government.
[2:17:29.880 --> 2:17:30.880]  Yes.
[2:17:30.880 --> 2:17:31.880]  Correct.
[2:17:31.880 --> 2:17:37.120]  And so if they can throw you in the mix, if they can prepare the American people to
[2:17:37.120 --> 2:17:42.000]  expect and the Europeans that the Russians are interfering with their elections, then
[2:17:42.000 --> 2:17:45.680]  it's payback time when they do it next January, December.
[2:17:45.680 --> 2:17:46.680]  Well, sure.
[2:17:46.680 --> 2:17:47.680]  That's what's happening.
[2:17:47.680 --> 2:17:54.080]  And again, they can brand opposition to globalism, nationalist as foreigners, or out to get
[2:17:54.080 --> 2:17:56.760]  the nation state when it's the globalist killing our nation state.
[2:17:56.760 --> 2:18:00.400]  And they change the subject on how they lost the election, how they rigged the election,
[2:18:00.400 --> 2:18:03.480]  how they got caught lying, how they got caught rigging the media.
[2:18:03.480 --> 2:18:06.080]  I mean, it's actually a genius PR move.
[2:18:06.080 --> 2:18:08.120]  It's not really working though.
[2:18:08.120 --> 2:18:09.920]  So that's why they're sharpening their knives.
[2:18:09.920 --> 2:18:13.960]  And I think it's a pretty sure factor in trying to kill the president.
[2:18:13.960 --> 2:18:21.880]  Well, I put it to you that every time they allege anything like you're an agent or a
[2:18:21.880 --> 2:18:27.400]  Roger Stone is an agent or anyone is an agent, you bring up the subject that it is Putin
[2:18:27.400 --> 2:18:29.400]  that they're trying to get after next year.
[2:18:29.400 --> 2:18:33.680]  And as the time approaches, you'll see how quiet they go on allegations against people
[2:18:33.680 --> 2:18:38.720]  like yourselves because they will not want to bring this subject up week after week,
[2:18:38.720 --> 2:18:40.400]  after months, all the way to March.
[2:18:40.400 --> 2:18:43.660]  Because they know that'll make Russians vote for him, realizing it's an outside force
[2:18:43.660 --> 2:18:45.160]  trying to stop that.
[2:18:45.160 --> 2:18:46.160]  Exactly.
[2:18:46.160 --> 2:18:51.600]  And also it will, it will encourage President Trump to be able to say, okay, now that we
[2:18:51.600 --> 2:18:55.000]  know what Trump needs to Trump this, he needs to meet with Putin immediately, make a big
[2:18:55.000 --> 2:18:59.880]  joke out of it, have Russia do some concessions just to totally defeat all this.
[2:18:59.880 --> 2:19:01.560]  I mean, because there's a load of crap.
[2:19:01.560 --> 2:19:07.800]  I mean, this is so ridiculous that they sit here and try to sell this and I mean, saying
[2:19:07.800 --> 2:19:13.200]  Rand Paul works for Putin, I mean, when's this going to end when John McCain's been
[2:19:13.200 --> 2:19:15.560]  caught working with Al Qaeda and ISIS in Syria?
[2:19:15.560 --> 2:19:18.480]  I mean, the guy is a total criminal.
[2:19:18.480 --> 2:19:23.760]  Well, they're not too intelligent, but they are really, really organized and they have
[2:19:23.760 --> 2:19:26.200]  a lot of money, too much money, I believe.
[2:19:26.200 --> 2:19:27.200]  I agree.
[2:19:27.200 --> 2:19:28.200]  They're totally ruthless.
[2:19:28.200 --> 2:19:29.200]  I'll be honest with you.
[2:19:29.200 --> 2:19:32.880]  What scares me is Pelosi not knowing that Bush isn't president for eight years.
[2:19:32.880 --> 2:19:37.600]  Same press conference, Maxine Waters, you know, thinks that Russia invaded Korea.
[2:19:37.600 --> 2:19:40.600]  You know, there's an order south and I haven't got the clips last few weeks.
[2:19:40.600 --> 2:19:41.600]  I've been too busy.
[2:19:41.600 --> 2:19:46.000]  We've got all sorts of space cadet, Maxine water, Pelosi stuff.
[2:19:46.000 --> 2:19:48.080]  They get up there and press conferences.
[2:19:48.080 --> 2:19:50.480]  They literally act like Alzheimer patients.
[2:19:50.480 --> 2:19:51.480]  I know.
[2:19:51.480 --> 2:19:56.200]  And they're like the leaders claiming Putin runs everything hell.
[2:19:56.200 --> 2:20:01.520]  They say Putin tells Trump drain the swamp crooked Hillary as if we haven't been saying
[2:20:01.520 --> 2:20:02.680]  that for 20 plus years.
[2:20:02.680 --> 2:20:06.840]  I mean, it's just, it's like cheap things were like her constituents, I guess that
[2:20:06.840 --> 2:20:07.840]  they're dumbed down.
[2:20:07.840 --> 2:20:10.560]  She literally thinks we don't have an original thought in our head.
[2:20:10.560 --> 2:20:14.840]  And so if she doesn't know what planet she's on, she wonders, how could I know?
[2:20:14.840 --> 2:20:16.840]  Does that make sense?
[2:20:16.840 --> 2:20:19.240]  It makes a lot of sense.
[2:20:19.240 --> 2:20:24.480]  And yet if you want to go back to the subject of Putin and his overthrow and the effort
[2:20:24.480 --> 2:20:29.880]  that the neocons are putting on, watch next month in France, how they're going to be alleging
[2:20:29.880 --> 2:20:35.160]  that, you know, one way or the other, Russia is involved against the French and against
[2:20:35.160 --> 2:20:37.120]  elections interference.
[2:20:37.120 --> 2:20:39.440]  Watch, that will be the clue.
[2:20:39.440 --> 2:20:42.640]  Well, you sound like a smart guy, Carlos.
[2:20:42.640 --> 2:20:43.640]  What's your background?
[2:20:43.640 --> 2:20:50.920]  I'm a PhD neuroscience, but I read that between the, the leaf, the tea leaves.
[2:20:50.920 --> 2:20:54.920]  Well, since you're a neuroscientist, I'm just reading the inserts on these vaccines.
[2:20:54.920 --> 2:20:58.600]  What do you make of all the increase in neurological disorders and the claim that vaccines have
[2:20:58.600 --> 2:21:01.400]  zero bad health effects?
[2:21:01.400 --> 2:21:11.040]  I, you know, the model of having dead organisms and developing memories and immune systems
[2:21:11.040 --> 2:21:15.920]  against it as a principle of vaccine is a good one.
[2:21:15.920 --> 2:21:20.360]  What I find is that across the board, it doesn't matter whether it's mortgages in the financial
[2:21:20.360 --> 2:21:26.360]  community or whether it is, you know, vaccines in the medical models or whether it is, you
[2:21:26.360 --> 2:21:31.880]  know, the truth in the media or religion, I find that there is an effort throughout the
[2:21:31.880 --> 2:21:40.400]  board and even the food products that we consume to, to abuse and to degenerate, adulterate
[2:21:40.400 --> 2:21:46.120]  the products in any way that is profitable, medicines, et cetera, regardless of what happens
[2:21:46.120 --> 2:21:47.120]  to society.
[2:21:47.120 --> 2:21:48.120]  And that's right.
[2:21:48.120 --> 2:21:53.360]  They're setting a present to lower standards, to maximize profit and have the public accept
[2:21:53.360 --> 2:21:54.360]  crap.
[2:21:54.360 --> 2:21:58.280]  There's a war on quality and whether it's a conspiracy or not, it's going on and you
[2:21:58.280 --> 2:22:01.920]  read the white papers, it is a conspiracy and that's why I go into a fast food place
[2:22:01.920 --> 2:22:02.920]  rarely.
[2:22:02.920 --> 2:22:06.960]  I leave the trash that makes them go create jobs for entry level.
[2:22:06.960 --> 2:22:08.480]  We just accept less.
[2:22:08.480 --> 2:22:11.400]  That's the world they're building and it goes right into medicine, everything else.
[2:22:11.400 --> 2:22:13.800]  Great call, Carlos, just a final point.
[2:22:13.800 --> 2:22:16.480]  What do you make of them coming out though and saying they're criminally investigating
[2:22:16.480 --> 2:22:20.720]  me for being in contact with Russian intelligence agencies, which of course is like saying I'm
[2:22:20.720 --> 2:22:25.400]  Pinocchio or Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer, it's total crap, unequivocally a fraud, makes
[2:22:25.400 --> 2:22:27.840]  me very, very angry that they're this desperate.
[2:22:27.840 --> 2:22:30.040]  What do you make of that?
[2:22:30.040 --> 2:22:36.560]  I make it that you should take paper and paper, a pencil and paper, get a paper trail and
[2:22:36.560 --> 2:22:44.440]  with a law sue anyone who dares this kind of unaccountability abuse of respect for
[2:22:44.440 --> 2:22:45.440]  me.
[2:22:45.440 --> 2:22:46.440]  No, I agree.
[2:22:46.440 --> 2:22:47.680]  And they were having the Washington Post and New York Times say it, they had to pull
[2:22:47.680 --> 2:22:51.040]  it because people were getting suits ready because clearly you say somebody's a foreign
[2:22:51.040 --> 2:22:54.880]  agent with no evidence and that's to destroy somebody and we should be shut down.
[2:22:54.880 --> 2:22:55.880]  Don't forget that.
[2:22:55.880 --> 2:22:56.880]  They want to shut us down.
[2:22:56.880 --> 2:23:02.480]  So they're saying like a gulag or something or a Nazi ghetto, put us in a ghetto.
[2:23:02.480 --> 2:23:06.800]  This is unprecedented in history and so now they're having the board of governors and
[2:23:06.800 --> 2:23:11.240]  the CIA come out and do it in Congress as if they have immunity.
[2:23:11.240 --> 2:23:16.000]  And what's crazy is this is a law Obama signed a month before Trump got in.
[2:23:16.000 --> 2:23:19.800]  Trump needs to go kill this, but then his advisor like sir, if you kill the Russian
[2:23:19.800 --> 2:23:22.240]  monitoring program, they'll say you must be Russian.
[2:23:22.240 --> 2:23:25.840]  No, they've set up a ministry of truth to harass the free press.
[2:23:25.840 --> 2:23:29.120]  It's a freaking joke.
[2:23:29.120 --> 2:23:31.320]  It's a joke.
[2:23:31.320 --> 2:23:34.840]  You said something very profound in one of your programs that really touched me and you
[2:23:34.840 --> 2:23:44.440]  said Americans cannot be free until they have their free from being surveilled.
[2:23:44.440 --> 2:23:50.440]  And this is essential if the only thing that President Trump does is to liberate Americans
[2:23:50.440 --> 2:23:56.720]  from being surveilled by being, you know, investigated or to be, it's like Uncle Sam
[2:23:56.720 --> 2:24:01.600]  became a dipping thumb and it's so sad.
[2:24:01.600 --> 2:24:05.760]  And then they admitted all and then Trump goes, it's illegal to leak that.
[2:24:05.760 --> 2:24:06.760]  We didn't do it.
[2:24:06.760 --> 2:24:07.760]  We didn't do it like that.
[2:24:07.760 --> 2:24:10.040]  Like there's not thousands of news articles with the headline.
[2:24:10.040 --> 2:24:15.320]  I mean, again, the insult of these people, the arrogance, I look at the weird cowards
[2:24:15.320 --> 2:24:20.320]  like that weirdo on reliable sources on CNN, like this little arrogant wimp.
[2:24:20.320 --> 2:24:21.920]  I'm not just saying that meanly.
[2:24:21.920 --> 2:24:24.920]  He looks like the most cowardly pathetic person I've ever seen.
[2:24:24.920 --> 2:24:25.920]  He just radiates.
[2:24:25.920 --> 2:24:27.520]  He's a piece of crap.
[2:24:27.520 --> 2:24:30.800]  And I just like, how are we ruled by these people?
[2:24:30.800 --> 2:24:31.800]  God bless you, Carlos.
[2:24:31.800 --> 2:24:34.080]  I appreciate your call.
[2:24:34.080 --> 2:24:38.760]  Well, it means we're winning.
[2:24:38.760 --> 2:24:40.840]  And I knew when we got Trump in the war, it just started out.
[2:24:40.840 --> 2:24:45.880]  My gut told me when he was elected, I said, oh my God, and I was told by a lot of smart
[2:24:45.880 --> 2:24:46.880]  folks too.
[2:24:46.880 --> 2:24:53.760]  They said, Alex, they said next level is the real fight.
[2:24:53.760 --> 2:24:58.200]  And I don't even care about myself and I say that selfishly.
[2:24:58.200 --> 2:25:02.360]  I've already, you know, you get older as a man, you just, you know, it's like, it's
[2:25:02.360 --> 2:25:03.360]  not even confidence anymore.
[2:25:03.360 --> 2:25:10.880]  You just don't care, but then I think about children and it makes me sick.
[2:25:10.880 --> 2:25:13.800]  But they do little kids with the vaccines, with the little kids of all of us, and they
[2:25:13.800 --> 2:25:15.320]  know what they're doing.
[2:25:15.320 --> 2:25:20.920]  And it's always somebody looks like a petapult pushing and it's always some weird demon creature.
[2:25:20.920 --> 2:25:25.080]  And I just, I just know this.
[2:25:25.080 --> 2:25:26.080]  They start a civil war.
[2:25:26.080 --> 2:25:28.160]  I'm not going after the poor cops.
[2:25:28.160 --> 2:25:31.760]  They're just like the citizens misdirected brainwashed.
[2:25:31.760 --> 2:25:33.160]  They start telling patriots.
[2:25:33.160 --> 2:25:38.520]  Everybody else, we need to know all of us know who the enemy is in your area, the people
[2:25:38.520 --> 2:25:44.520]  that are running this stuff because as soon as they get in the physical fight that they
[2:25:44.520 --> 2:25:45.520]  start.
[2:25:45.520 --> 2:25:50.120]  Remember, we don't ever do something offensive, but as soon as they step into that arena,
[2:25:50.120 --> 2:25:54.840]  it's important they get hammered hard.
[2:25:54.840 --> 2:26:01.880]  And they take those of us that have restraint, big governors, because we got big machines.
[2:26:01.880 --> 2:26:04.440]  And genetically, I'm a builder.
[2:26:04.440 --> 2:26:05.440]  I'm also a killer.
[2:26:05.440 --> 2:26:08.200]  I mean, I'm not, I mean, flip a switch.
[2:26:08.200 --> 2:26:12.800]  I mean, it's, it's, it's bad.
[2:26:12.800 --> 2:26:17.600]  And I see these wimps living that world.
[2:26:17.600 --> 2:26:18.600]  They've never actually been in it.
[2:26:18.600 --> 2:26:20.520]  They haven't even, they don't have the genetics for it.
[2:26:20.520 --> 2:26:22.840]  They have the genetics to creep around all day and stab people in the back.
[2:26:22.840 --> 2:26:26.560]  And they're trying to start fights with people because they've got this little, this little
[2:26:26.560 --> 2:26:27.560]  evil side.
[2:26:27.560 --> 2:26:28.560]  They don't have a good side.
[2:26:28.560 --> 2:26:29.560]  They've got this evil.
[2:26:29.560 --> 2:26:33.720]  They've got giant evil sides because their good sides are so much even huger than that.
[2:26:33.720 --> 2:26:40.320]  And they're sitting there starting fights with people that, that they would be so horrified
[2:26:40.320 --> 2:26:41.320]  of.
[2:26:41.320 --> 2:26:43.880]  They think they're horrified of good people because we're good.
[2:26:43.880 --> 2:26:45.440]  They don't know why they're horrified.
[2:26:45.440 --> 2:26:49.680]  They're horrified because they worship evil and our evil side is so much bigger and more
[2:26:49.680 --> 2:26:51.080]  evil than their side.
[2:26:51.080 --> 2:26:55.200]  It's just counter veiled by the good.
[2:26:55.200 --> 2:26:58.680]  So if you want to open the gates, open the gates.
[2:26:58.680 --> 2:27:05.280]  Hold them at your peril, but you don't care scum never cares till the cold fingers wrapped
[2:27:05.280 --> 2:27:11.160]  around their neck.
[2:27:11.160 --> 2:27:17.080]  We're ruled by mentally retarded people like Pelosi and Michael Moore.
[2:27:17.080 --> 2:27:21.120]  And it's our fault they're in power and it needs to change when you do everything peaceful
[2:27:21.120 --> 2:27:24.920]  now all the sunshell signs to change the paradigm.
[2:27:24.920 --> 2:27:29.120]  What I'm saying is, I know a lot of you think we're winning.
[2:27:29.120 --> 2:27:30.320]  We're in the fight now.
[2:27:30.320 --> 2:27:31.320]  We're not winning.
[2:27:31.320 --> 2:27:33.360]  The war is now.
[2:27:33.360 --> 2:27:34.360]  Michael in Florida.
[2:27:34.360 --> 2:27:35.360]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[2:27:35.360 --> 2:27:36.360]  Go ahead.
[2:27:36.360 --> 2:27:37.360]  Hey, Alex.
[2:27:37.360 --> 2:27:38.360]  How you doing?
[2:27:38.360 --> 2:27:39.360]  Good brother.
[2:27:39.360 --> 2:27:40.360]  Oh man.
[2:27:40.360 --> 2:27:42.520]  I got a couple things to talk to you about.
[2:27:42.520 --> 2:27:44.480]  First thing, start off, Roger Stone.
[2:27:44.480 --> 2:27:46.960]  What the heck is Pelosi doing with this shift guy?
[2:27:46.960 --> 2:27:51.160]  She put this guy in power and now he's putting all this political crap out in the air.
[2:27:51.160 --> 2:27:56.120]  Yeah, chef looks like the creepiest person I've ever seen with those little weirdo bug
[2:27:56.120 --> 2:27:57.120]  eyed things.
[2:27:57.120 --> 2:27:58.120]  He's got going all the crap.
[2:27:58.120 --> 2:27:59.120]  Everybody's a Russian agent.
[2:27:59.120 --> 2:28:01.400]  How about you're an agent of the Communist Chinese jerk?
[2:28:01.400 --> 2:28:03.800]  It's a Democratic party's run by them.
[2:28:03.800 --> 2:28:04.800]  Exactly.
[2:28:04.800 --> 2:28:06.160]  Run his mouth everywhere.
[2:28:06.160 --> 2:28:07.160]  You're a Russian agent.
[2:28:07.160 --> 2:28:08.160]  You're a Russian agent.
[2:28:08.160 --> 2:28:09.840]  They're the traitors against this country.
[2:28:09.840 --> 2:28:11.480]  What do you think?
[2:28:11.480 --> 2:28:15.840]  I think he's completely a traitor and he's also, you know, he's one of our biggest battles
[2:28:15.840 --> 2:28:18.280]  in our spiritual war that we're doing here.
[2:28:18.280 --> 2:28:22.280]  And like you just said about the evil, about the good, I think you're a little wrong on
[2:28:22.280 --> 2:28:23.280]  that.
[2:28:23.280 --> 2:28:26.280]  I think our good is so much stronger than their evil.
[2:28:26.280 --> 2:28:30.440]  No, I'm not saying, I'm not saying it's some balanced new age thing, good and evil.
[2:28:30.440 --> 2:28:31.440]  It's the opposite.
[2:28:31.440 --> 2:28:38.240]  I'm saying most good people out there have a vicious side to them, but it's governed
[2:28:38.240 --> 2:28:42.800]  by the good and the fact they love God, that a lot of good people though, the evil people
[2:28:42.800 --> 2:28:44.680]  are trying to be evil, trying to be powerful.
[2:28:44.680 --> 2:28:46.800]  They have no idea that it's good that's more powerful.
[2:28:46.800 --> 2:28:51.160]  I'm just saying they worship evil and they have no idea, according to their paradigm
[2:28:51.160 --> 2:28:54.800]  of evil, the capabilities of what a good person can do.
[2:28:54.800 --> 2:28:55.800]  Agreed.
[2:28:55.800 --> 2:28:59.000]  But you've got to realize most of these people don't even know they're evil.
[2:28:59.000 --> 2:29:02.160]  They're so brainwashed by this television that they're watching every single thing and
[2:29:02.160 --> 2:29:05.640]  they don't even realize they're being told that evil is good and good is evil and they're
[2:29:05.640 --> 2:29:07.000]  starting to believe it.
[2:29:07.000 --> 2:29:10.480]  Well, you look at chef just by his actions, but his looking his eyes.
[2:29:10.480 --> 2:29:14.000]  That is a super bad news person.
[2:29:14.000 --> 2:29:15.000]  Agreed.
[2:29:15.000 --> 2:29:16.240]  But what can we do for stone?
[2:29:16.240 --> 2:29:17.840]  Is there anything we can help him with?
[2:29:17.840 --> 2:29:21.400]  No, he's having the time of his life fighting him and knows it's all crap and they might
[2:29:21.400 --> 2:29:22.400]  try to kill him.
[2:29:22.400 --> 2:29:23.400]  They've already tried to kill him twice.
[2:29:23.400 --> 2:29:24.400]  He's actually coming up in 10 minutes.
[2:29:24.400 --> 2:29:26.800]  But Michael, let me come back and let you finish your point about the Comey hearing because
[2:29:26.800 --> 2:29:27.800]  I cut into you.
[2:29:27.800 --> 2:29:31.760]  Then I'm going to go to Lex, Chris, Beth, and others, then Wilde, then Roger Stone just
[2:29:31.760 --> 2:29:34.160]  as an update is going to pop in because I now joined the club.
[2:29:34.160 --> 2:29:35.960]  I mean, they've said I'm like, end of the horizon.
[2:29:35.960 --> 2:29:44.960]  No, I'm under investigation by the counter espionage unit of the FBI for being under the
[2:29:44.960 --> 2:29:48.400]  control of Russian intelligence.
[2:29:48.400 --> 2:29:49.720]  We're on the march.
[2:29:49.720 --> 2:29:59.600]  The empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[2:29:59.600 --> 2:30:02.400]  Ashley Beckford here for info wars.com.
[2:30:02.400 --> 2:30:09.400]  I have an article linked from the San Diego Tribune North County car rolls bad to photograph
[2:30:09.400 --> 2:30:14.920]  every car entering city, quote, to me, $1 million is a drop in the market.
[2:30:14.920 --> 2:30:21.280]  The bucket when you are trying to protect 100,000 or more people, Carl's bad is expanding
[2:30:21.280 --> 2:30:27.840]  its use of automatic license plate readers into a system that aims to collect the registration
[2:30:27.840 --> 2:30:31.200]  information of every vehicle that enters the city.
[2:30:31.200 --> 2:30:37.560]  The $1 million police department project, which will add stationary cameras at 14 key
[2:30:37.560 --> 2:30:43.640]  car rolls bad intersections, creating a virtual gateway at the city's borders was approved
[2:30:43.640 --> 2:30:49.080]  by the city council last week, sparking outrage over privacy rights and government control
[2:30:49.080 --> 2:30:52.680]  from several residents and one council member.
[2:30:52.680 --> 2:30:59.240]  Stay tuned for more special reports at info wars.com.
[2:30:59.240 --> 2:31:03.480]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you

[2:31:13.800 --> 2:31:15.400]  at info wars.com.

[2:31:23.320 --> 2:31:28.560]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[2:31:28.560 --> 2:31:32.760]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the

[2:31:47.440 --> 2:31:53.200]  this is a sure win, 10% off on auto ship, win win win at infowarslife.com, free shipping

[2:31:57.960 --> 2:31:58.960]  auto ship.
[2:31:58.960 --> 2:32:04.200]  Today, we call it bone broth and for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits
[2:32:04.200 --> 2:32:07.560]  before it became a loss to our modern diets, a processed junk.
[2:32:07.560 --> 2:32:12.760]  We are now introducing caveman by infowarslife.com, the ultimate and true paleo nutrition with
[2:32:12.760 --> 2:32:18.960]  bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single
[2:32:18.960 --> 2:32:21.320]  great tasting formula, caveman.
[2:32:21.320 --> 2:32:25.320]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our
[2:32:25.320 --> 2:32:29.280]  superior ancestors and we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[2:32:29.280 --> 2:32:33.320]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal, you used the meat for sustenance,
[2:32:33.320 --> 2:32:38.640]  the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength, from the outside structure full
[2:32:38.640 --> 2:32:42.560]  of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[2:32:42.560 --> 2:32:45.120]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[2:32:45.120 --> 2:32:49.480]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back
[2:32:49.480 --> 2:32:53.080]  to that essence that made us what we were and this is a big part of it.
[2:32:53.080 --> 2:32:57.520]  I know you're going to want to check out caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself in infowarslife.com
[2:32:57.520 --> 2:33:15.920]  today.
[2:33:15.920 --> 2:33:28.240]  From Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:28.240 --> 2:33:32.920]  Think how far we've come in the fight against tyranny.
[2:33:32.920 --> 2:33:37.680]  But think of the depths our enemies will stoop to to attack us.
[2:33:37.680 --> 2:33:42.320]  President Trump, a Russian agent, Senator Rand Paul, a Russian agent on the floor of
[2:33:42.320 --> 2:33:48.120]  the Senate, accused of it with zero evidence.
[2:33:48.120 --> 2:33:53.360]  Myself accused of being a Russian agent in the House and Senate committee meetings.
[2:33:53.360 --> 2:33:55.720]  I've just shown you one clip, we're trying to find the others.
[2:33:55.720 --> 2:33:57.160]  We have transcripts of it.
[2:33:57.160 --> 2:34:00.600]  It's happened at least seven times I know of the last week.
[2:34:00.600 --> 2:34:02.520]  Does that scare me?
[2:34:02.520 --> 2:34:07.920]  No, that makes me think, wow, I'm really getting to the satisfied point now that I did my job
[2:34:07.920 --> 2:34:15.160]  because I'm going to go on to the end, whatever the cost may be, we'll defend this Republican
[2:34:15.160 --> 2:34:18.560]  humanity.
[2:34:18.560 --> 2:34:25.520]  I just feel sorry for people that aren't part of the big victory because the fact that
[2:34:25.520 --> 2:34:31.200]  globalism, unelected world government, so outrageous is now being exposed and falling
[2:34:31.200 --> 2:34:42.920]  as we speak, and the omen of day the Rockefeller dying in the midst of this battle.
[2:34:42.920 --> 2:34:46.600]  These are days that will be long remembered.
[2:34:46.600 --> 2:34:52.360]  Make no mistake, I used to hear that quote from Kennedy and think it was cheesy.
[2:34:52.360 --> 2:34:54.680]  Ask not what your country can do for you, what you can do for your country.
[2:34:54.680 --> 2:34:59.840]  Well, my country is about the people and empowering humanity and strength and honor and the renaissance
[2:34:59.840 --> 2:35:04.240]  is absolutely because that's what people gave to put us here.
[2:35:04.240 --> 2:35:08.880]  It's the honor, it's the strength, it's the will.
[2:35:08.880 --> 2:35:15.160]  When you're so selfish for your children and so selfish in your love for the truth that
[2:35:15.160 --> 2:35:24.640]  you're willing to lay everything down, people would call that being unselfish, no it's not.
[2:35:24.640 --> 2:35:28.040]  That's what they don't get.
[2:35:28.040 --> 2:35:32.840]  That's when you join with everything good in the universe forever is when you make the
[2:35:32.840 --> 2:35:39.680]  free will choice to be honorable and to have courage and to not be a piece of crap.
[2:35:39.680 --> 2:35:44.000]  And that's why these people that serve evil are given temporal power.
[2:35:44.000 --> 2:35:50.840]  It's like rags, dirty diapers, it's just crap, mansions, money, helicopters, empty people.
[2:35:50.840 --> 2:35:55.160]  You get around the centers of power, they've got all these palaces and all this crap, but
[2:35:55.160 --> 2:35:59.960]  there's a spirit of failure at emptying us to it.
[2:35:59.960 --> 2:36:07.840]  But you go out fishing on an old boat, an old man on the ocean who knows how the world
[2:36:07.840 --> 2:36:12.400]  works and where we came from and you hear their little parables and you know this is
[2:36:12.400 --> 2:36:15.080]  wisdom and there's deep strength in it.
[2:36:15.080 --> 2:36:20.120]  Or an old woman or a young man or a young girl, whatever it is, it's truth.
[2:36:20.120 --> 2:36:31.080]  Like wind through the trees as the sun rises, the sun sets, as our lives go on, it's a spirit.
[2:36:31.080 --> 2:36:40.720]  It's where you decide to be in that strong, quiet place of the most high.
[2:36:40.720 --> 2:36:45.040]  And that's where I am when I'm not on air.
[2:36:45.040 --> 2:36:51.000]  Hours and hours a day in just controlled focus.
[2:36:51.000 --> 2:36:54.280]  And then I have to look at all the news and look at the enemy and look at them and I come
[2:36:54.280 --> 2:36:57.480]  on here and I blow up because it's just a joke.
[2:36:57.480 --> 2:37:00.800]  Why would anyone follow these clear enemies?
[2:37:00.800 --> 2:37:04.240]  These are known liars.
[2:37:04.240 --> 2:37:16.760]  These enslavers, these persecutors of the children, there's that saying it's the journey
[2:37:16.760 --> 2:37:27.560]  not the destination, the trip is the destination.
[2:37:27.560 --> 2:37:31.680]  And that really is what life is on this planet.
[2:37:31.680 --> 2:37:37.760]  It's not about the things you have or how other people think you're powerful.
[2:37:37.760 --> 2:37:39.040]  That's enslavement.
[2:37:39.040 --> 2:37:47.080]  You only need to be strong to defend and protect what's good.
[2:37:47.080 --> 2:37:54.120]  I mean we should all thank God every minute that we aren't Nancy Pelosi or Schiff or Hillary
[2:37:54.120 --> 2:37:58.280]  Clinton or these globalists or Herman von Rumpi or any of these people.
[2:37:58.280 --> 2:38:11.800]  I mean look at these people, these are pathetic, twisted, warped, openly evil, grasping, scum.
[2:38:11.800 --> 2:38:12.800]  Michael, finish your points.
[2:38:12.800 --> 2:38:13.800]  You got caught off by the break.
[2:38:13.800 --> 2:38:14.800]  Go ahead.
[2:38:14.800 --> 2:38:15.800]  Yeah, they're skexies.
[2:38:15.800 --> 2:38:17.280]  Alex, that's all they are.
[2:38:17.280 --> 2:38:19.200]  They never will be anything else.
[2:38:19.200 --> 2:38:21.000]  Just remember this.
[2:38:21.000 --> 2:38:24.840]  You can't walk into a room full of candles with any amount of darkness and extinguish
[2:38:24.840 --> 2:38:29.020]  the light, but you can walk into any room full of any amount of darkness with one candle
[2:38:29.020 --> 2:38:30.320]  and extinguish the darkness.
[2:38:30.320 --> 2:38:31.320]  They're that weak.
[2:38:31.320 --> 2:38:32.320]  That's right.
[2:38:32.320 --> 2:38:33.320]  They're not strong.
[2:38:33.320 --> 2:38:34.320]  That's why they seek power.
[2:38:34.320 --> 2:38:35.320]  That's why they seek power.
[2:38:35.320 --> 2:38:37.320]  It's because they are weak.
[2:38:37.320 --> 2:38:41.000]  Well, the only deception, all the power they have is deception.
[2:38:41.000 --> 2:38:48.920]  And once you put the light on their deception and tell the truth, they fail every time.
[2:38:48.920 --> 2:38:57.200]  It's holding the light onto the evil one that makes him run and scurry like a cockroach.
[2:38:57.200 --> 2:39:01.040]  I got to say, Alex, I got to give you so much credit.
[2:39:01.040 --> 2:39:03.080]  I've been watching you for five years.
[2:39:03.080 --> 2:39:07.920]  I have friends and family that tell me, you are a liar, you're insane, you do all this
[2:39:07.920 --> 2:39:14.640]  crazy stuff, and all I constantly do is look and do the research of everything you say
[2:39:14.640 --> 2:39:20.120]  and everything that I've seen in five years is either come true or is true.
[2:39:20.120 --> 2:39:25.920]  Well, that's why they attack my credibility all day is all I try to do is tell the truth.
[2:39:25.920 --> 2:39:30.000]  I make mistakes sometimes, but I'm a God-fearing person.
[2:39:30.000 --> 2:39:35.720]  So all of us, if we have the Holy Spirit, the presence of God, I would be to even think
[2:39:35.720 --> 2:39:39.760]  like to get a mean to think of doing bad things, creates incredible anxiety and fear.
[2:39:39.760 --> 2:39:44.000]  I never have fear unless I think about crossing God, and I don't even want to cross God.
[2:39:44.000 --> 2:39:48.800]  When I study the enemy and what they're doing, I feel fear of God, just what they're doing,
[2:39:48.800 --> 2:39:49.800]  watching them.
[2:39:49.800 --> 2:39:53.400]  And I don't mean I'm some perfect person, but I mean, I think about how they want to
[2:39:53.400 --> 2:39:56.520]  hurt children, how they want to hurt God's greatest creation, how they want to attack
[2:39:56.520 --> 2:40:01.840]  women and the womb and the relationship of our families and our whole human past and
[2:40:01.840 --> 2:40:06.200]  everything we've been together, and it's just outrageous how bad they are.
[2:40:06.200 --> 2:40:10.280]  But people are asleep, and so the veil is being lifted, but don't thank me, brother.
[2:40:10.280 --> 2:40:12.000]  Wild horses couldn't drag me away.
[2:40:12.000 --> 2:40:17.520]  I want to ignite men like you who are as smart as I am or smarter to be your own leaders
[2:40:17.520 --> 2:40:18.720]  and take action.
[2:40:18.720 --> 2:40:22.080]  And when you do that, which is starting to happen, the enemy will fall.
[2:40:22.080 --> 2:40:23.080]  Go ahead.
[2:40:23.080 --> 2:40:25.080]  Well, let me ask you this.
[2:40:25.080 --> 2:40:27.400]  We're allowed to re-broadcast your information.
[2:40:27.400 --> 2:40:28.400]  Is that correct?
[2:40:28.400 --> 2:40:29.400]  Yes.
[2:40:29.400 --> 2:40:33.760]  All right, because I have no problem doing so, and I'm ready to start another, my own
[2:40:33.760 --> 2:40:35.320]  channel as well.
[2:40:35.320 --> 2:40:37.760]  And I want to get in the information out there.
[2:40:37.760 --> 2:40:39.240]  There's some great people out on the web.
[2:40:39.240 --> 2:40:43.280]  They're all working together and they're all on our side, and they're actually working
[2:40:43.280 --> 2:40:46.840]  together as a community, and it's nice to see.
[2:40:46.840 --> 2:40:52.960]  I can't say more about what's happening other than you are the tip of the spear.
[2:40:52.960 --> 2:40:57.760]  Every single time you say it, I feel it, I see it, and your products are amazing.
[2:40:57.760 --> 2:40:58.760]  Well, thank you.
[2:40:58.760 --> 2:40:59.760]  The products.
[2:40:59.760 --> 2:41:05.400]  I had a problem with my teeth, and I will tell you, super blue has helped.
[2:41:05.400 --> 2:41:06.400]  Thank you.
[2:41:06.400 --> 2:41:07.400]  God bless you.
[2:41:07.400 --> 2:41:09.720]  Yeah, I barely plug an hour.
[2:41:09.720 --> 2:41:11.520]  The enemy all has big globalist funding.
[2:41:11.520 --> 2:41:15.440]  We fund ourselves 70% or so with, well, I guess it'll be more now, we got manned off
[2:41:15.440 --> 2:41:16.440]  Google Ads.
[2:41:16.440 --> 2:41:20.280]  So I go outside the show to go try to make the money to fund the operation, and if I
[2:41:20.280 --> 2:41:22.960]  won the lottery, I don't play the lottery, but I won the lottery, and I would put it
[2:41:22.960 --> 2:41:23.960]  all into the operation.
[2:41:23.960 --> 2:41:26.560]  We were driving back from hunting the other day with some friends, they said, what would
[2:41:26.560 --> 2:41:27.560]  you do with the lottery?
[2:41:27.560 --> 2:41:28.560]  What would you do?
[2:41:28.560 --> 2:41:31.560]  And I said, I'll put it all back in the operation.
[2:41:31.560 --> 2:41:39.560]  I mean, I can't even stand, it's not that it's bad, the possessions and crap.
[2:41:39.560 --> 2:41:42.440]  It's all just means nothing.
[2:41:42.440 --> 2:41:46.720]  You need medicine, you need transportation, but the enemy is people to sell out for nothing.
[2:41:46.720 --> 2:41:50.880]  They want to keep us poor, keep us under their control, keep us things artificially scarce
[2:41:50.880 --> 2:41:52.880]  so they can buy us up for nothing.
[2:41:52.880 --> 2:41:59.600]  And Trump's trying to break that, and that's his greatest sin, is he wants a big prosperous
[2:41:59.600 --> 2:42:03.880]  country, he wants to be the guy that turned America around, the guy that launched the
[2:42:03.880 --> 2:42:08.360]  huge dynasty, he's totally in.
[2:42:08.360 --> 2:42:11.840]  He understands how much trouble the economy's in, he's making hundreds of phone calls today
[2:42:11.840 --> 2:42:15.520]  trying to get jobs back to prop it up, he understands Obamacare, this is how to destroy
[2:42:15.520 --> 2:42:16.520]  it.
[2:42:16.520 --> 2:42:19.720]  So even though this other bill isn't perfect, he can get it done, and it's better in ways
[2:42:19.720 --> 2:42:23.920]  it'll stabilize things, I understand.
[2:42:23.920 --> 2:42:28.960]  But you did too good, Trump, we did too good, people aren't putting up with that, bro.
[2:42:28.960 --> 2:42:32.680]  You're going to have total repeal, we're going to defund all the agencies just like
[2:42:32.680 --> 2:42:35.480]  you're doing, we're going to go on to the end no matter what happens.
[2:42:35.480 --> 2:42:39.240]  I got Roger Stone to pop on, so many developments have happened, we're going to go to Chris,
[2:42:39.240 --> 2:42:44.160]  Beth Wilde, Lex and others after Roger leaves us, he just here a few minutes, but first,
[2:42:44.160 --> 2:42:48.800]  here's Senator Rand Paul again last week, this click this morning, like I've been attacked
[2:42:48.800 --> 2:42:53.080]  as a Russian agent in McClatchy, AP, Reuters, you name it, I mean the leftist groups are
[2:42:53.080 --> 2:42:56.800]  saying good, arrest Alec Jones.
[2:42:56.800 --> 2:43:01.000]  And they like hop up and down like I'm scared, arrest me, shoot me in the back of the head,
[2:43:01.000 --> 2:43:06.960]  whatever the, I'm not a Russian agent, I'm an agent of the Republic and prosperity in
[2:43:06.960 --> 2:43:07.960]  Americana.
[2:43:07.960 --> 2:43:14.720]  But those of you that don't have that background, I understand, I get it, you come from parasites
[2:43:14.720 --> 2:43:18.920]  and trash, I'm sorry for you, you just see somebody up there like a champion battling
[2:43:18.920 --> 2:43:26.720]  for you like Trump or myself, and whether we're perfect or not, we are your champions,
[2:43:26.720 --> 2:43:32.880]  we're in the arena, we're here, we're under the attack, we want to be here, we're just
[2:43:32.880 --> 2:43:38.760]  saying we need your prayers, because this isn't a game, this isn't a joke, it's not
[2:43:38.760 --> 2:43:43.480]  a simulation, but I can tell you there's stuff behind the scenes and I won't tell you because
[2:43:43.480 --> 2:43:54.040]  I can't, it's been hard, but I realize the more good I do, my personal persecution out
[2:43:54.040 --> 2:44:03.600]  of my family is to teach me lessons so that I can empathize with other people.
[2:44:03.600 --> 2:44:08.440]  Because to really empathize, you have to go through the things other people are going
[2:44:08.440 --> 2:44:11.720]  through, because that's where the strength is.
[2:44:11.720 --> 2:44:22.080]  Not ignoring your feelings, not ignoring humanity, but really going into it, taking it all on.
[2:44:22.080 --> 2:44:25.360]  That's where the strength is, and just letting these people know no matter what they do,
[2:44:25.360 --> 2:44:27.360]  we're not going to stop.
[2:44:27.360 --> 2:44:30.560]  Here's the clip of Senator Rand Paul being attacked, and then the latest of myself, and
[2:44:30.560 --> 2:44:35.720]  then Roger Stone, and in the NDAA, in the New Defense Authorization Act, they talk about
[2:44:35.720 --> 2:44:39.080]  even militarily going after us, not just taking over the media, and they have the board of
[2:44:39.080 --> 2:44:44.560]  governors, the very ones, the CIA is taking over, testifying that I'm a Russian agent
[2:44:44.560 --> 2:44:48.280]  with no proof in front of the House Armed Services Committee.
[2:44:48.280 --> 2:44:52.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, this means they're planning to kill Trump, they've decided in their government
[2:44:52.480 --> 2:44:56.960]  operations that this is the truth, they're trying to sell weak-minded people on this
[2:44:56.960 --> 2:45:03.800]  being the idea, and we are on the verge of total war.
[2:45:03.800 --> 2:45:10.080]  Trump needs to take action, the threats are credible, the Secret Service has done nothing,
[2:45:10.080 --> 2:45:16.000]  he needs to understand that the Secret Service can't protect him.
[2:45:16.000 --> 2:45:20.880]  We're already in a civil emergency, they're pushing a civil war, the Republic is in a
[2:45:20.880 --> 2:45:26.600]  death battle, we can't paper over it, Trump has to move against the enemy with them, they're
[2:45:26.600 --> 2:45:30.000]  claiming where they admitted with them because they're the enemy, but let's play this clip
[2:45:30.000 --> 2:45:32.000]  and then we'll skip this break, go to Roger Stone.
[2:45:32.000 --> 2:45:36.120]  Here is the clip of them going after Senator Paul.
[2:45:36.120 --> 2:45:41.880]  The only conclusion you can draw when he walks away is he has no argument to be made, he
[2:45:41.880 --> 2:45:51.520]  has no justification for his objection to having a small nation be part of NATO that
[2:45:51.520 --> 2:45:53.520]  is under assault from the Russians.
[2:45:53.520 --> 2:46:00.880]  So I repeat again, the Center from Kentucky is now working for Vladimir Putin.
[2:46:00.880 --> 2:46:04.920]  Because he tries to pass a bill out of committee without a hearing on the floor to start a
[2:46:04.920 --> 2:46:09.080]  war and put US troops into Montenegro in the Balkans.
[2:46:09.080 --> 2:46:13.520]  He's already got bills in the same in Ukraine and he's like, no, we're going to have debates
[2:46:13.520 --> 2:46:14.520]  about this.
[2:46:14.520 --> 2:46:15.600]  Oh, you're a Russian agent.
[2:46:15.600 --> 2:46:21.400]  In the day of Andrew Jackson, he had dragged him out in the street and they had a duel.
[2:46:21.400 --> 2:46:24.200]  Here's one more clip that we're going to Roger Stone.
[2:46:24.200 --> 2:46:28.320]  Again, I got a bunch of these clips, they're saying Tucker Carlson's a Russian agent, you
[2:46:28.320 --> 2:46:32.200]  know, Schiff, the minion of Pelosi, little, little, little, little, pillow-biter man.
[2:46:32.200 --> 2:46:35.520]  I'm not against people that are like that, but it's just this ridiculous, whatever the
[2:46:35.520 --> 2:46:38.680]  hell's going on with you guys, it's completely out of his mind, just the stuff he does is
[2:46:38.680 --> 2:46:43.800]  and then of course you've got them, the Board of Governors, the FCC in front of Congress
[2:46:43.800 --> 2:46:45.160]  saying I'm a Russian operative.
[2:46:45.160 --> 2:46:46.160]  Here it is.
[2:46:46.160 --> 2:46:52.640]  Mr. Armstrong, you mentioned in your answer to I think Ms. Spears question that there
[2:46:52.640 --> 2:46:55.760]  are other RTs operating in the US.
[2:46:55.760 --> 2:46:58.120]  Can you describe them, list them?
[2:46:58.120 --> 2:46:59.120]  Sure.
[2:46:59.120 --> 2:47:00.120]  Thank you.
[2:47:00.120 --> 2:47:07.360]  So you have other RTs and then he lists some clip thing like Getty Images and then Sputnik
[2:47:07.360 --> 2:47:10.600]  and Russia and then me, here it is, sorry.
[2:47:10.600 --> 2:47:18.920]  Of R.T., you have Sputnik, you have Rupley and then I think you have them feeding other
[2:47:18.920 --> 2:47:27.640]  entities, InfoWars comes to mind where those are echo chambers for those modalities.
[2:47:27.640 --> 2:47:31.240]  You know, Armstrong, I deserve to be able to answer you with your immunity.
[2:47:31.240 --> 2:47:34.480]  I deserve to stand against you, but I'll just say this for the God and everybody else, you're
[2:47:34.480 --> 2:47:38.680]  an enemy of this country and a sack of crap and a globalist operative and the Communist
[2:47:38.680 --> 2:47:42.320]  Chinese have infiltrated us so bad, I don't even know if we can fix it.
[2:47:42.320 --> 2:47:45.040]  Piece of trash.
[2:47:45.040 --> 2:47:46.040]  I'm sorry.
[2:47:46.040 --> 2:47:48.320]  Let's go to Roger Stone right now.
[2:47:48.320 --> 2:47:51.800]  Roger, you've been dealing with this for months, but it's entered a new phase.
[2:47:51.800 --> 2:47:57.600]  I've said they're going to incrementally escalate it till they make their move on Trump.
[2:47:57.600 --> 2:47:59.040]  They are the inside enemy.
[2:47:59.040 --> 2:48:00.200]  They're what they say we are.
[2:48:00.200 --> 2:48:04.720]  They're the ones that are trying to stop the recovery, destroy our borders, blocking the
[2:48:04.720 --> 2:48:05.720]  other sanctuary cities.
[2:48:05.720 --> 2:48:08.880]  I mean, I'm sorry, Trump has to move against them.
[2:48:08.880 --> 2:48:15.880]  Yeah, Alex, that performance yesterday by the House Intelligence Committee was a first
[2:48:15.880 --> 2:48:24.720]  class example of demagoguery, red-baiting, clear-mongering, half-truths, no-truths.
[2:48:24.720 --> 2:48:29.440]  Every word pejoratively worded to distort it.
[2:48:29.440 --> 2:48:34.200]  The Democrats just don't seem to be able to face up to the fact that they ran a lousy,
[2:48:34.200 --> 2:48:35.960]  corrupt candidate.
[2:48:35.960 --> 2:48:40.240]  She had no program and the Donald Trump was the real thing.
[2:48:40.240 --> 2:48:44.720]  And they had the whole media and the bots and the whole system is admitted to be fake.
[2:48:44.720 --> 2:48:45.720]  So what do we do?
[2:48:45.720 --> 2:48:50.120]  Because clearly they're not getting the Pentagon involved, the CIA and the media, and saying
[2:48:50.120 --> 2:48:51.480]  we're Russian agents for nothing.
[2:48:51.480 --> 2:48:52.960]  They've already tried to kill you twice.
[2:48:52.960 --> 2:48:54.080]  They're moving against us.
[2:48:54.080 --> 2:48:55.760]  So what does Trump do?
[2:48:55.760 --> 2:49:01.960]  Well, and in my case, I have this particularly nice setup where they ask James Comey repeatedly
[2:49:01.960 --> 2:49:07.480]  about me and he says, oh, I can't comment on that, leaving the pregnant implication
[2:49:07.480 --> 2:49:13.840]  hanging in the air that I am being investigated, therefore I've done something wrong.
[2:49:13.840 --> 2:49:16.680]  These things have to be refuted one by one.
[2:49:16.680 --> 2:49:23.640]  There is no evidence whatsoever of any Russian collusion to elect Donald Trump.
[2:49:23.640 --> 2:49:24.640]  It's a fraud.
[2:49:24.640 --> 2:49:27.040]  The American people did it.
[2:49:27.040 --> 2:49:31.040]  The whole media and the bots and foreign governments were piled on against Trump, not the other
[2:49:31.040 --> 2:49:32.040]  way around.
[2:49:32.040 --> 2:49:38.760]  And in the case of John McCain, whose clip you just played, I mean, with all due respect,
[2:49:38.760 --> 2:49:41.000]  the senator's mentally unbalanced.
[2:49:41.000 --> 2:49:43.560]  He needs a psychological test.
[2:49:43.560 --> 2:49:46.040]  He is so driven by bitterness and anger.
[2:49:46.040 --> 2:49:47.040]  No, I agree.
[2:49:47.040 --> 2:49:51.600]  So what I'm asking you is obviously I'm now accused, which we just is even, I mean, this
[2:49:51.600 --> 2:49:52.600]  is so ridiculous.
[2:49:52.600 --> 2:49:54.040]  I've known this ridiculous for the year.
[2:49:54.040 --> 2:49:55.040]  Our phones have been tapped.
[2:49:55.040 --> 2:49:58.760]  It's all come out in the news, total blackout on that other than drudge.
[2:49:58.760 --> 2:49:59.760]  What does Trump do?
[2:49:59.760 --> 2:50:03.600]  Because he's got a bunch of wimps in his administration who make all the mistakes.
[2:50:03.600 --> 2:50:05.600]  He doesn't make mistakes so far.
[2:50:05.600 --> 2:50:09.640]  He needs to like have, I mean, she got money from the Chinese, money from the Russians
[2:50:09.640 --> 2:50:12.560]  10,000 times what Trump ever did.
[2:50:12.560 --> 2:50:15.160]  It's, I mean, we need to go after these damn people.
[2:50:15.160 --> 2:50:19.120]  They're trying to destroy us when they're the ones on the Russian payroll.
[2:50:19.120 --> 2:50:21.360]  I want them indicted now.
[2:50:21.360 --> 2:50:23.560]  I want in front of the Senate now.
[2:50:23.560 --> 2:50:26.280]  I want Armstrong here with boxing gloves on.
[2:50:26.280 --> 2:50:27.280]  That son of a bitch.
[2:50:27.280 --> 2:50:29.280]  I'm a Russian agent.
[2:50:29.280 --> 2:50:30.280]  Sorry.
[2:50:30.280 --> 2:50:31.280]  Go ahead.
[2:50:31.280 --> 2:50:32.280]  I'm skipping the break.
[2:50:32.280 --> 2:50:38.160]  Unfortunately, Ryan's previous is not exactly a wartime conciliary.
[2:50:38.160 --> 2:50:41.680]  These are Lily livered country club established in Republicans.
[2:50:41.680 --> 2:50:46.480]  They're a bunch of cowardly bootlicking cucks that have been sticking their noses up.
[2:50:46.480 --> 2:50:51.040]  People's, you know, what's forever and Trump needs to get the hell away from them.
[2:50:51.040 --> 2:50:54.800]  But specifically, let's say, for example, the fact that you and I both know that the
[2:50:54.800 --> 2:51:01.280]  president was under surveillance at Trump Tower, that surveillance of him bring starts
[2:51:01.280 --> 2:51:07.240]  much, much earlier, uh, actually under the Bush administration as info wars revealed
[2:51:07.240 --> 2:51:08.240]  only yesterday.
[2:51:08.240 --> 2:51:10.960]  And notice total static on that two days ago.
[2:51:10.960 --> 2:51:11.960]  No response.
[2:51:11.960 --> 2:51:12.960]  No, nothing.
[2:51:12.960 --> 2:51:13.960]  Media matters.
[2:51:13.960 --> 2:51:14.960]  Didn't even deny it was real.
[2:51:14.960 --> 2:51:17.120]  Instead, they said, have they released classified info?
[2:51:17.120 --> 2:51:18.120]  And now I'm getting phone calls.
[2:51:18.120 --> 2:51:19.520]  Oh, you released classified info.
[2:51:19.520 --> 2:51:20.520]  Yeah.
[2:51:20.520 --> 2:51:22.120]  That was spying on Trump.
[2:51:22.120 --> 2:51:24.000]  Stick that up your, your snout.
[2:51:24.000 --> 2:51:29.720]  Well, in the meantime, what you have is the president's chief advisors like Sean Spicer
[2:51:29.720 --> 2:51:35.680]  and, uh, uh, Ryan's previous ringing their hands and saying, Oh, can we walk this back?
[2:51:35.680 --> 2:51:40.640]  We really had a put out an apology and the Trump countermans and says, I never apologized.
[2:51:40.640 --> 2:51:41.640]  Exactly.
[2:51:41.640 --> 2:51:42.640]  Because he's right.
[2:51:42.640 --> 2:51:43.640]  He shouldn't apologize.
[2:51:43.640 --> 2:51:46.160]  It's a book for a year for the Watergate coverup to.
[2:51:46.160 --> 2:51:49.960]  Do you know what he did saying our coal is back up for years?
[2:51:49.960 --> 2:51:52.360]  That is trillions just in the next decade of years.
[2:51:52.360 --> 2:51:57.280]  That's trillions taken from Russia, uh, in energy sales, driving down the price of natural
[2:51:57.280 --> 2:52:02.240]  gas that we're now shipping in, in, in massive ships out of the Gulf of Mexico.
[2:52:02.240 --> 2:52:04.160]  He just devastated Russia.
[2:52:04.160 --> 2:52:05.160]  He's dumb.
[2:52:05.160 --> 2:52:06.520]  And we're not even trying to devastate Russia.
[2:52:06.520 --> 2:52:11.680]  The point is our stock market was up because Trump is back in business for America.
[2:52:11.680 --> 2:52:17.080]  He is devastating everybody to answer your question as to what the president must do.
[2:52:17.080 --> 2:52:18.080]  It's obvious.
[2:52:18.080 --> 2:52:22.640]  Let's go on off edge, lay out the crimes of Bill and Hillary.
[2:52:22.640 --> 2:52:27.200]  Start by telling this Jeff sessions to appoint a special prosecutor and let's go over those
[2:52:27.200 --> 2:52:34.960]  650,000 emails that were found the last minute that came from, uh, Kuma Abedin to her secret
[2:52:34.960 --> 2:52:42.480]  private server, uh, let's lay out the Chinese, uh, assistance, uh, to the Clinton campaign.
[2:52:42.480 --> 2:52:46.320]  The president has the bully pulpit and he has the power.
[2:52:46.320 --> 2:52:48.440]  He's got to attack just like he lost the first debate.
[2:52:48.440 --> 2:52:49.440]  We said, you got to attack.
[2:52:49.440 --> 2:52:50.440]  He did.
[2:52:50.440 --> 2:52:56.720]  He's got to attack and attack now exactly because you see the, the, uh, the establishment
[2:52:56.720 --> 2:53:01.880]  Republicans around him don't have a belly and notice they're attacking Roger stone and
[2:53:01.880 --> 2:53:09.160]  Alex Jones and Matt drudge and others because we will attack because they fear the attack.
[2:53:09.160 --> 2:53:16.160]  Well, Sean Spicer says he has no idea what role I played in the 26th election, 2016 election.
[2:53:16.160 --> 2:53:21.640]  I would strongly urge that he get a copy of the making of the president 2016, how Donald
[2:53:21.640 --> 2:53:22.640]  Trump orchestrated.
[2:53:22.640 --> 2:53:28.160]  Oh, Spicer, is there all a bunch of sick of fans and I, who the point is, is that Trump
[2:53:28.160 --> 2:53:33.840]  miscalculated his first time going along with this, uh, this, this Paul Ryan bill.
[2:53:33.840 --> 2:53:37.280]  I understand why he did it because it's going to wreck the economy and he done it's better
[2:53:37.280 --> 2:53:38.280]  than the Obama bill.
[2:53:38.280 --> 2:53:40.480]  I get it only by maybe 30%.
[2:53:40.480 --> 2:53:43.520]  And so that's where he got his first dent in his approval writings.
[2:53:43.520 --> 2:53:47.280]  Trump really has to get back on the attack.
[2:53:47.280 --> 2:53:54.440]  I, I could not agree more and he has such a wealth of information now at his fingertips.
[2:53:54.440 --> 2:53:57.720]  So, um, unfortunately he got no honeymoons.
[2:53:57.720 --> 2:54:01.760]  I understand that the, you know, the new president tries to get along with everybody
[2:54:01.760 --> 2:54:05.760]  in the beginning, but this is, this is dog eat dog closing.
[2:54:05.760 --> 2:54:06.760]  I know you're at the airport.
[2:54:06.760 --> 2:54:07.760]  You got to go.
[2:54:07.760 --> 2:54:11.080]  Thanks for popping in, but I've now joined the club with you and I get why you were so
[2:54:11.080 --> 2:54:16.080]  mad when you're actually accused on TV of being a Russian agent and you're under investigation.
[2:54:16.080 --> 2:54:17.880]  It pisses you off.
[2:54:17.880 --> 2:54:19.480]  You know, it's just, it's crazy.
[2:54:19.480 --> 2:54:25.000]  So, so what does it mean now that I'm officially being investigated, being directed by Russian
[2:54:25.000 --> 2:54:26.000]  agents?
[2:54:26.000 --> 2:54:30.960]  Uh, yesterday I had three different press calls all asking me whether I know or whether
[2:54:30.960 --> 2:54:37.520]  or not Alex Jones's broadcasts are being supported by Russian funded bots.
[2:54:37.520 --> 2:54:40.040]  And the answer is, of course, no.
[2:54:40.040 --> 2:54:45.000]  But is it coincidental that three different mainstream media reporters call all in the
[2:54:45.000 --> 2:54:53.480]  same day with the same load of, uh, you know, with that same steaming pile of dung?
[2:54:53.480 --> 2:54:55.960]  We're supported by our listeners and they're calling them bots.
[2:54:55.960 --> 2:54:56.960]  They didn't vote.
[2:54:56.960 --> 2:54:57.960]  They didn't take action.
[2:54:57.960 --> 2:54:59.680]  I've gotten zero money from the Russians.
[2:54:59.680 --> 2:55:02.480]  What the, God, they're like the Russians have the GDP of Italy.
[2:55:02.480 --> 2:55:04.560]  They can't even run their own giant country.
[2:55:04.560 --> 2:55:10.040]  They just claim that you and I, I'm known, you for 40 plus years, a patriot, right-wing
[2:55:10.040 --> 2:55:14.840]  nationalist, anti, you know, Soviet, rolling up Russian operations in DC, that I'm the
[2:55:14.840 --> 2:55:19.080]  super patriot, that we're Russian agents is laughable, but it gives them the cover on
[2:55:19.080 --> 2:55:23.760]  the deep state to make a political runs at us and to use government funding for disinfo
[2:55:23.760 --> 2:55:24.760]  against this.
[2:55:24.760 --> 2:55:26.760]  And that's what this is about, Roger.
[2:55:26.760 --> 2:55:27.760]  There's no question about it.
[2:55:27.760 --> 2:55:34.520]  There is a slow motion coup to take out Donald Trump and I for one have no intention of
[2:55:34.520 --> 2:55:35.520]  letting that happen.
[2:55:35.520 --> 2:55:38.720]  Well, let me say this in closing, they tried to kill you with Poloni and they T-bones you
[2:55:38.720 --> 2:55:39.720]  last week.
[2:55:39.720 --> 2:55:41.360]  They want to kill you before there's hearings.
[2:55:41.360 --> 2:55:42.600]  You need to go to the press club.
[2:55:42.600 --> 2:55:43.600]  I'll send a crew.
[2:55:43.600 --> 2:55:46.600]  You need to have a press conference demanding it happen.
[2:55:46.600 --> 2:55:51.480]  We'll build it up for next week or whenever you want and just say, my God, you know,
[2:55:51.480 --> 2:55:56.720]  America, wake up to this and say before they kill me because they're trying to kill you.
[2:55:56.720 --> 2:56:00.320]  No doubt before you get up there and now that I've been put in the bag, I'm not stupid.
[2:56:00.320 --> 2:56:02.560]  They know I'll destroy them in a real debate.
[2:56:02.560 --> 2:56:06.320]  They want to be able to crucify dead men as strong men.
[2:56:06.320 --> 2:56:11.320]  Roger, we're truly together in this in history and you know, I'm honored.
[2:56:11.320 --> 2:56:12.720]  We're defending America.
[2:56:12.720 --> 2:56:15.280]  We've put a president in there with the American people that is trying to turn the country
[2:56:15.280 --> 2:56:16.280]  back on.
[2:56:16.280 --> 2:56:20.160]  We've done a man's job already, brother, but we've got a lot further to go.
[2:56:20.160 --> 2:56:25.240]  I can't think of anybody I'd rather be in the foxhole more with because I will fight
[2:56:25.240 --> 2:56:26.240]  to the very end.
[2:56:26.240 --> 2:56:30.920]  We've got the globalists on the line and I'm not going down without a fight.
[2:56:30.920 --> 2:56:33.600]  It's good to be here, buddy, with that machine gun with you and we'll keep feeding those
[2:56:33.600 --> 2:56:34.600]  belts.
[2:56:34.600 --> 2:56:35.600]  We're going to win.
[2:56:35.600 --> 2:56:36.600]  Take care, Alex.
[2:56:36.600 --> 2:56:38.000]  I'm going to jump on this plane here.
[2:56:38.000 --> 2:56:39.000]  Absolutely.
[2:56:39.000 --> 2:56:40.000]  All right.
[2:56:40.000 --> 2:56:41.000]  I'm going to go to break.
[2:56:41.000 --> 2:56:42.000]  Take a few more calls.
[2:56:42.000 --> 2:56:47.640]  Then Paul Watts is coming in from London, England, revved up, ready to go.
[2:56:47.640 --> 2:56:52.360]  We've got the new fluoride-free high-quality toothpaste with the iodine and the clodal
[2:56:52.360 --> 2:56:53.360]  silver in it.
[2:56:53.360 --> 2:56:58.320]  Super blue is back in for a limited time to get the ingredients, to get the mass amounts
[2:56:58.320 --> 2:56:59.320]  made.
[2:56:59.320 --> 2:57:03.440]  We're going to escalate and do like five times more so that we don't always have problems
[2:57:03.440 --> 2:57:08.480]  with manufacturing and production, but it is available now and you get two tubes of
[2:57:08.480 --> 2:57:09.480]  it.
[2:57:09.480 --> 2:57:10.480]  It's discounted on $8 a tube.
[2:57:10.480 --> 2:57:11.480]  It's super high-quality.
[2:57:11.480 --> 2:57:15.920]  M4sLive.com, M4store.com, 30-40% off the high-quality, suitable food.
[2:57:15.920 --> 2:57:16.920]  We do that rarely.
[2:57:16.920 --> 2:57:17.920]  It's high-quality.
[2:57:17.920 --> 2:57:25.000]  M4sLive.com, M4store.com, or AAA-253-3139, but I can tell you, I've not compromised.
[2:57:25.000 --> 2:57:29.200]  I've not faltered or given in or backed down.
[2:57:29.200 --> 2:57:33.160]  I just want to defeat a bunch of anti-human scum and a bunch of psychopaths.
[2:57:33.160 --> 2:57:34.600]  I don't want power, money, any of it.
[2:57:34.600 --> 2:57:36.000]  I don't say that as like a platitude.
[2:57:36.000 --> 2:57:38.440]  I mean, people need to understand why I'm doing this.
[2:57:38.440 --> 2:57:39.440]  These are bad people.
[2:57:39.440 --> 2:57:40.440]  They must be.
[2:57:40.440 --> 2:57:48.080]  My soul, my gut, my spirit wants to defeat them and they serve their wicked energy.
[2:57:48.080 --> 2:57:49.320]  They want to crush us.
[2:57:49.320 --> 2:57:50.320]  So I know I'm in a fight.
[2:57:50.320 --> 2:57:56.240]  I'm there to tell you, we're all in a fight and you need to get the products, you need
[2:57:56.240 --> 2:57:57.560]  to filter your water.
[2:57:57.560 --> 2:57:58.560]  We got the best system.
[2:57:58.560 --> 2:58:00.440]  We got the best system to grow a garden and be pro-human.
[2:58:00.440 --> 2:58:01.440]  It's fun to do.
[2:58:01.440 --> 2:58:02.680]  Even in the city, you can do it.
[2:58:02.680 --> 2:58:03.680]  Huge selection.
[2:58:03.680 --> 2:58:04.680]  Non-GMO, early MCs.
[2:58:04.680 --> 2:58:09.640]  You need to get a Trump 2020 shirt at infowarsstore.com.
[2:58:09.640 --> 2:58:14.440]  You need to spread the links, the articles, the infowars.com, M4sLive.com, M4sLive.com,
[2:58:14.440 --> 2:58:15.440]  M4sLive.com, M4sLive.com, M4sLive.com, M4sLive.com, M4sLive.com, M4sLive.com, M4sLive.com, M4sLive.com,
[2:58:15.440 --> 2:58:42.480]  M4sLive.com, M4sLive.com, M4sLive.com, M4sLive.com, M4sLive.com, M4sLive.com, M4sLive.com, M4sLive.com,
[2:58:42.480 --> 2:58:53.680]  We have the new product at m4slife.com, Biotru Selenium.
[2:58:53.680 --> 2:58:58.440]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able
[2:58:58.440 --> 2:59:04.440]  to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from Mustard Seed Extract.
[2:59:04.440 --> 2:59:09.240]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your
[2:59:09.240 --> 2:59:10.240]  body.
[2:59:10.240 --> 2:59:14.480]  It balances the thyroid gland, it helps detoxify.
[2:59:14.480 --> 2:59:16.960]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[2:59:16.960 --> 2:59:20.920]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used
[2:59:20.920 --> 2:59:21.920]  all over the body.
[2:59:21.920 --> 2:59:28.000]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium,
[2:59:28.000 --> 2:59:33.280]  so it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[2:59:33.280 --> 2:59:35.080]  I'm taking it now every day.
[2:59:35.080 --> 2:59:36.080]  This is soaking.
[2:59:36.080 --> 2:59:38.560]  Biotru Selenium is the product.
[2:59:38.560 --> 2:59:41.760]  The best selenium that we could bring you, we believe is the best out there at a very,
[2:59:41.760 --> 2:59:42.760]  very low price.
[2:59:42.760 --> 2:59:51.960]  Excusably available at m4slife.com or by calling toll-free, triple-eight, two-five, three-three-one-three-nine.
[2:59:51.960 --> 3:00:21.240]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:21.240 --> 3:00:29.160]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWare.
[3:00:29.160 --> 3:00:33.680]  In our attempt to restore the Republic, an American reboot, loveless and captured the
[3:00:33.680 --> 3:00:36.640]  country, running around like psychopathic demons, ripping everybody off.
[3:00:36.640 --> 3:00:39.400]  Paul Watson, I'm going to take a few phone calls here in this short segment from Chris
[3:00:39.400 --> 3:00:44.480]  and Beth at least and a few others if you want to, but tell us what's coming up today.
[3:00:44.480 --> 3:00:46.320]  Paul, did you know?
[3:00:46.320 --> 3:00:48.560]  It's all over the Senate committee and House committee.
[3:00:48.560 --> 3:00:49.560]  We work for the Russians.
[3:00:49.560 --> 3:00:51.360]  I didn't know that.
[3:00:51.360 --> 3:00:56.240]  Well, I'm yet to receive my check from the Kremlin, Alex, but what we've not discussed
[3:00:56.240 --> 3:01:01.600]  and I'm going to play the clip later is the source of this whole Russian troll box control
[3:01:01.600 --> 3:01:06.280]  info wars and we're working with them is somebody called Louise Mench, who has come
[3:01:06.280 --> 3:01:10.820]  out with the most crazy conspiracy theories imaginable.
[3:01:10.820 --> 3:01:16.160]  She claims that Vladimir Putin personally ordered the assassination of Andrew Breitbart,
[3:01:16.160 --> 3:01:18.800]  so then Steve Bannon would be able to take over it.
[3:01:18.800 --> 3:01:22.560]  She was completely decimated during a recent interview on BBC.
[3:01:22.560 --> 3:01:27.000]  She's absolutely crazy and she's the source of this story and now the FBI has picked
[3:01:27.000 --> 3:01:29.240]  up on it.
[3:01:29.240 --> 3:01:34.000]  So they've got a true cook as the old, just like Washington Post had to retract a few
[3:01:34.000 --> 3:01:36.960]  months ago, their fake list saying we were Russian funded.
[3:01:36.960 --> 3:01:39.200]  They withdrew it because they admitted it was fake.
[3:01:39.200 --> 3:01:41.920]  So they just found a new cook to put it out.
[3:01:41.920 --> 3:01:42.920]  Yeah, exactly.
[3:01:42.920 --> 3:01:47.720]  I mean, you can say what you want, but the fact is, you know, Democrats have lost sixty
[3:01:47.720 --> 3:01:52.720]  three house seats, ten Senate seats, twelve governorship, nine hundred legislative seats.
[3:01:52.720 --> 3:01:57.160]  Yeah, since 2009 was Russia to blame for all that.
[3:01:57.160 --> 3:01:58.160]  You can look at friends.
[3:01:58.160 --> 3:02:00.600]  Europe's pissed about all the Muslims being brought in.
[3:02:00.600 --> 3:02:03.240]  They claim that that's in this report against me today.
[3:02:03.240 --> 3:02:06.880]  They claim that that's Russia to everything's Russia.
[3:02:06.880 --> 3:02:10.520]  You know, over in France, they claim Russia is helping Le Pen.
[3:02:10.520 --> 3:02:16.520]  She's got 39% support amongst 18 to 24 year olds, according to polls, more than double
[3:02:16.520 --> 3:02:17.920]  her nearest rival.
[3:02:17.920 --> 3:02:19.320]  Is that Russia?
[3:02:19.320 --> 3:02:25.680]  You know, you've got 41% in the UK now voting conservative over liberal and labor.
[3:02:25.680 --> 3:02:26.680]  Is that Russia?
[3:02:26.680 --> 3:02:27.680]  Is everything Russia?
[3:02:27.680 --> 3:02:33.240]  No, we're rejecting a bunch of mega banks run by jerks like Zuckerberg saying they rule
[3:02:33.240 --> 3:02:34.240]  us.
[3:02:34.240 --> 3:02:35.240]  I mean, that's what's happening.
[3:02:35.240 --> 3:02:36.240]  No.
[3:02:36.240 --> 3:02:42.880]  And I mean, that big article's gone up with all the examples of Google, Facebook, Twitter
[3:02:42.880 --> 3:02:45.380]  manipulating their algorithms.
[3:02:45.380 --> 3:02:50.520]  If the FBI wants to investigate someone for manipulating voters during the election, go
[3:02:50.520 --> 3:02:51.520]  and investigate Facebook.
[3:02:51.520 --> 3:02:56.640]  Oh, that's a stack I never got to when they admittedly ran Google, Facebook for Hillary,
[3:02:56.640 --> 3:02:57.760]  foreign governments involved.
[3:02:57.760 --> 3:02:58.760]  No discussion.
[3:02:58.760 --> 3:03:05.200]  I love Donna Brazil bitching about how Russian bots rig stuff when she was on record rigging
[3:03:05.200 --> 3:03:07.880]  the debates.
[3:03:07.880 --> 3:03:08.880]  It's amazing.
[3:03:08.880 --> 3:03:13.460]  It's like, you know, we have problems communicating with each other sometimes and yet was supposedly
[3:03:13.460 --> 3:03:18.320]  in constant communication with evil Russian controllers in the Kremlin telling us what
[3:03:18.320 --> 3:03:19.320]  to do.
[3:03:19.320 --> 3:03:20.320]  Just the very idea.
[3:03:20.320 --> 3:03:22.400]  Well, that's because they're a bunch of followers.
[3:03:22.400 --> 3:03:26.120]  Paul, you're one of the senior folks around here, but there's very little communication
[3:03:26.120 --> 3:03:27.120]  about what to do.
[3:03:27.120 --> 3:03:32.040]  We're all too busy manning the guns here, but let's put your headline back up on screen.
[3:03:32.040 --> 3:03:33.800]  Here it is dealing with this.
[3:03:33.800 --> 3:03:36.120]  Why the FBI is in for Russia.
[3:03:36.120 --> 3:03:37.120]  Investigations completely ludicrous.
[3:03:37.120 --> 3:03:39.800]  You're going to go over this after the break.
[3:03:39.800 --> 3:03:40.800]  Take over.
[3:03:40.800 --> 3:03:41.800]  Paul Watson.
[3:03:41.800 --> 3:03:42.800]  All right.
[3:03:42.800 --> 3:03:45.640]  Alex, yeah, we're going to go over that and we're going to flash back to a headline we
[3:03:45.640 --> 3:03:52.680]  had up on Friday, which was Google obviously caught now gaming their algorithms to bury
[3:03:52.680 --> 3:03:53.920]  certain topics.
[3:03:53.920 --> 3:03:58.960]  You had an article up on info wars.com, the headline Google to target criticism of Islam
[3:03:58.960 --> 3:04:00.520]  in new censorship purge.
[3:04:00.520 --> 3:04:03.880]  And again, very few people picked up on this.
[3:04:03.880 --> 3:04:09.560]  They announced that they would be censoring quote upsetting offensive content on Google
[3:04:09.560 --> 3:04:15.080]  burying search results directly manipulating the information, which is what they accuse
[3:04:15.080 --> 3:04:16.080]  us of doing.
[3:04:16.080 --> 3:04:21.800]  Now, if you look at the reasons given for declaring something quote upsetting offensive,
[3:04:21.800 --> 3:04:28.520]  the example that is provided is a website that says Islam is intolerant.
[3:04:28.520 --> 3:04:33.120]  Now whether you want to talk about acid attacks, people having their hands chopped off under
[3:04:33.120 --> 3:04:38.600]  Sharia law, stoning female rape victims to death, all those things happen.
[3:04:38.600 --> 3:04:42.360]  Many of them are supported by shockingly large numbers of Muslims.
[3:04:42.360 --> 3:04:48.600]  And in fact, we've got a new poll out of France, which shows again, shocking attitudes of intolerance
[3:04:48.600 --> 3:04:50.360]  amongst followers of Islam.
[3:04:50.360 --> 3:04:56.040]  So just make the statement that Islam is intolerant is complete fact yet now they're declaring
[3:04:56.040 --> 3:05:00.000]  that as fake news will be back.
[3:05:00.000 --> 3:05:04.600]  Judge Neil Gorsuch gave his opening statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee Monday on
[3:05:04.600 --> 3:05:08.760]  the first day of hearings on his nomination to the US Supreme Court.
[3:05:08.760 --> 3:05:14.220]  In it he unpacked his views on the job of unelected judges in a democratic republic giving
[3:05:14.220 --> 3:05:19.800]  his personal story and pledging to be a public servant who faithfully follows the Constitution
[3:05:19.800 --> 3:05:23.640]  and the laws enacted by the people's elected representatives.
[3:05:23.640 --> 3:05:28.920]  Judging is sometimes a lonely and hard job, Gorsuch mused in a wide ranging speech that
[3:05:28.920 --> 3:05:34.200]  ranged from the dramatic to the humorous to reflections at times showing deep passion
[3:05:34.200 --> 3:05:37.000]  and on two occasions even getting emotional.
[3:05:37.000 --> 3:05:43.160]  Today Gorsuch sparred with Feinstein as well as other senators as they grilled him on his
[3:05:43.160 --> 3:05:44.160]  policies.
[3:05:44.160 --> 3:05:49.280]  It looks like that we're going to have a Supreme Court judge just like Antonin Scalia.
[3:05:49.280 --> 3:05:59.760]  Stay tuned to the Alex Jones show at infowars.com slash show to follow the Senate hearings.
[3:05:59.760 --> 3:06:01.120]  This is Alex Jones.

[3:08:12.040 --> 3:08:15.960]  and now your host Paul Joseph Watson
[3:08:15.960 --> 3:08:26.120]  we're back it's the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show just touching on censorship
[3:08:26.840 --> 3:08:33.320]  in particular google censorship before the break youtube which of course is owned by google has
[3:08:33.320 --> 3:08:41.080]  introduced a new restricted mode for its platform where basically if you select this restricted
[3:08:41.080 --> 3:08:47.640]  mode you will be protected from offensive and upsetting content the problem with that is that
[3:08:47.640 --> 3:08:53.960]  a bunch of lgbt groups came out and claimed that they were being unfairly discriminated against
[3:08:53.960 --> 3:08:59.720]  again it's kind of ironic that they only get they only get angry about google youtube censorship
[3:08:59.720 --> 3:09:05.160]  when it affects them we've been whining about it that infinitum for months and months but if you
[3:09:05.160 --> 3:09:12.600]  look at this google censorship on youtube again owned by google the channels affected in restricted
[3:09:12.600 --> 3:09:20.040]  mode guess which channels are affected guess which videos completely disappear when you look at the
[3:09:20.040 --> 3:09:27.080]  Alex Jones channel when you look at my channel all of them every single video on youtube's new
[3:09:27.080 --> 3:09:33.880]  restricted mode on my channel on Alex Jones the channel completely disappears when you select this
[3:09:33.880 --> 3:09:41.320]  option which channels are unaffected by this new restricted mode introduced by youtube well imagine
[3:09:41.320 --> 3:09:49.560]  my shock it's cnn it's cnbc even though in many of their videos they're covering the exact same
[3:09:49.560 --> 3:09:56.120]  news stories that we are in our videos there's no nudity there's no violence in many of them
[3:09:56.120 --> 3:10:03.240]  there's not even any bad language we're covering the exact same stories as cnbc as cnn not a single
[3:10:03.240 --> 3:10:10.440]  one of their videos is restricted in restricted mode so you go and cnn's channel every single
[3:10:10.440 --> 3:10:17.400]  video is available to watch you go on the Alex Jones channel not a single video is up there so
[3:10:17.400 --> 3:10:23.000]  obviously they're using this to target people who they don't like politically it's not about
[3:10:23.000 --> 3:10:30.600]  protecting people from nudity or violence they're using it to censor free speech yet another way
[3:10:30.600 --> 3:10:35.160]  and we're talking about this of course because McClashy came out with a big report last night
[3:10:35.160 --> 3:10:44.040]  confirming that the FBI is investigating RT Breitbart Spotnik and info wars for links with
[3:10:44.040 --> 3:10:51.320]  the Kremlin basically arguing on a completely baseless conspiracy theory that we're somehow
[3:10:51.320 --> 3:10:58.200]  coordinating with Putin's troll bot army to spread information before the election to sink
[3:10:58.200 --> 3:11:04.040]  Hillary Clinton and to help Donald Trump as we document in this article well let's take it from
[3:11:04.040 --> 3:11:09.240]  this angle for a start this is of course all about fake news they want to create the pretext
[3:11:09.240 --> 3:11:16.680]  that we're fake news that we're discredited that we can be censored on all these social media platforms
[3:11:16.680 --> 3:11:21.240]  how do they do that well they say we're spreading this fake news it's put out there deliberately
[3:11:21.240 --> 3:11:27.640]  to deceive people to make money of course that's a completely different category there are individuals
[3:11:27.640 --> 3:11:33.480]  who do that we've never done that but the point is this Danford University came out with a major
[3:11:33.480 --> 3:11:39.640]  study a couple of months ago into fake news they found and you can go and read the study for yourself
[3:11:39.640 --> 3:11:46.600]  that it had absolutely no impact on the US presidential election so before you even get
[3:11:46.600 --> 3:11:53.960]  into an argument about who's pushing fake news doesn't even matter had no impact whatsoever
[3:11:53.960 --> 3:12:00.760]  on the US election there you see the headline in fact they went into the drill down into the
[3:12:00.760 --> 3:12:07.480]  numbers of this study and found that if anything fake news benefited Hillary Clinton because the
[3:12:07.480 --> 3:12:13.560]  fake news articles that were spread most were beneficial to were positive about Hillary Clinton
[3:12:14.280 --> 3:12:20.440]  yet they've spun this entire narrative that Donald Trump won the election because of fake news
[3:12:20.440 --> 3:12:27.160]  being coordinated by Vladimir Putin's troll bar army absolutely ridiculous of course
[3:12:27.160 --> 3:12:33.320]  we're going to get into it in a second the only people that manipulated public opinion that manipulated
[3:12:33.320 --> 3:12:40.760]  news feeds were google facebook and twitter the very thing they accuse us of doing but it's
[3:12:40.760 --> 3:12:48.840]  interesting to look back as to the source the individual who originated this deluded baseless
[3:12:48.840 --> 3:12:55.320]  conspiracy theory that we are somehow in control of the Putin troll bar army or we're coordinating
[3:12:55.320 --> 3:13:02.120]  with them it of course traces back to an individual by the name of Louise Mench who is now living in
[3:13:02.120 --> 3:13:10.280]  America but is was a formatory MP now a journalist and is known for some let's just say quite kooky
[3:13:10.280 --> 3:13:17.880]  theories one of which is that Vladimir Putin personally ordered the assassination of Andrew
[3:13:17.880 --> 3:13:23.560]  Breitbart and in fact we've got a clip from a recent interview she did with the BBC where even the
[3:13:23.560 --> 3:13:30.280]  BBC host basically owns her in the argument because she sounds absolutely insane when she
[3:13:30.280 --> 3:13:36.600]  tries to make this argument let's go to the clip you've also claimed as an adjunct you've also so
[3:13:36.600 --> 3:13:41.400]  just to be clear we don't really have hard evidence yet whether this warrant exists it may or it may
[3:13:41.400 --> 3:13:45.640]  not there is some doubt about the evidence there's lots of claims whether there's evidence about
[3:13:45.640 --> 3:13:50.520]  Mr. Trump and the Russians is another matter and you've also claimed the president put in
[3:13:50.520 --> 3:13:56.120]  had Andrew Breitbart murdered to pave the way for Steve Bannon this was the man who founded the
[3:13:56.120 --> 3:14:02.120]  Breitbart website to pave the way for Steve Bannon to play a key role in the Trump administration
[3:14:02.120 --> 3:14:07.480]  you then said that Mr. Bannon is behind bomb threats to Jewish community centers I mean aren't
[3:14:07.480 --> 3:14:14.840]  you in danger of just peddling wild conspiracy theories no first of all I haven't and no matter
[3:14:14.840 --> 3:14:20.040]  how many times people say this it's not going to be true I said on Twitter in a tweet I believe
[3:14:20.040 --> 3:14:23.880]  that to be the case about the murder of Andrew Breitbart that's what I just said but it's not
[3:14:23.880 --> 3:14:30.440]  a piece of it it's not no no I didn't know I did it don't you Andrew I said I believe it you said
[3:14:30.440 --> 3:14:34.360]  I reported it those are two completely different things you put it out on Twitter you said you
[3:14:34.360 --> 3:14:40.360]  believed it and you don't have a shred of evidence I do and indeed I've made no I made no
[3:14:40.360 --> 3:14:46.520]  sense the evidence that Mr. Putin murdered Mr. Breitbart what's the evidence I believe it
[3:14:48.280 --> 3:14:53.640]  I didn't say look you may believe you may believe there are fairies at the bottom of your garden
[3:14:53.640 --> 3:14:59.720]  it doesn't make it true I may indeed and if I say so then that's my belief if I say this is I am
[3:14:59.720 --> 3:15:04.120]  reporting as I did with the FISA warrant that a FISA warrant exists you may rest assured that I have
[3:15:04.120 --> 3:15:09.720]  a basis in fact for a report a belief is just a belief so let me just get the working I will
[3:15:09.720 --> 3:15:14.760]  report upon it no I look I know you're relatively new to journalism so let me just get the rules
[3:15:14.760 --> 3:15:23.160]  right if it's if it's Twitter if it's Twitter we don't believe it but if it's on your website we
[3:15:23.160 --> 3:15:29.960]  should believe it if I report something and I say this happened then I'm making an assertion
[3:15:29.960 --> 3:15:35.320]  if I describe a belief I'm describing a belief I know subtlety may be a little difficult for you
[3:15:35.320 --> 3:15:39.560]  but there's no no I just think that if you want to be a journalist if you want to be a journalist
[3:15:39.560 --> 3:15:46.760]  beliefs have to be backed up with some evidence really what do you have a faith well it's not a
[3:15:46.760 --> 3:15:53.000]  matter of faith that or maybe in your case the president Putin murdered Andrew Breitbart are
[3:15:53.000 --> 3:15:58.040]  using a belief and a report are two different things and no matter how often you say that they
[3:15:58.040 --> 3:16:04.360]  are the same they will never be the same you you you've said in today's Sunday Times here in London
[3:16:04.360 --> 3:16:09.960]  that you've turned into I quote your word that you're a temporary superpower where you court see
[3:16:09.960 --> 3:16:18.280]  things really clearly I mean have you become delusional no I'm describing a biological basis
[3:16:18.280 --> 3:16:23.480]  for ADHD which I have which as any of your any of your viewers who are doctors will know
[3:16:24.360 --> 3:16:28.840]  provides people with a unfortunately a lot of scattered focus they're very messy absolutely
[3:16:28.840 --> 3:16:33.400]  profess but when they're interested in things they have ADHD they can have a condition called
[3:16:33.400 --> 3:16:39.080]  hyper focus which means that you concentrate very hard on a given subject and you can see
[3:16:39.080 --> 3:16:43.800]  patterns and connections that's biological and I don't reside from it for a moment all right thank
[3:16:43.800 --> 3:16:48.040]  you for everything that Louise mentioned for being up there in New York it's you are the first
[3:16:48.040 --> 3:16:54.680]  time ever I've interviewed a temporary superpower thank you for that you're so lucky you're so yeah
[3:16:54.680 --> 3:17:00.680]  I don't think it's going to happen again there you have it ladies and gentlemen that is the
[3:17:00.680 --> 3:17:07.480]  impeccable source of the claim that info was worked with Russian troll bar armies to swing the
[3:17:07.480 --> 3:17:13.800]  election for Donald Trump that's their impeccable source right there a woman who believes that
[3:17:13.800 --> 3:17:20.840]  Vladimir Putin personally ordered the assassination of Andrew Breitbart a woman who believes that
[3:17:20.840 --> 3:17:27.560]  she's got superpowers that allow her to see connections where no one else can a woman who
[3:17:27.560 --> 3:17:33.800]  was exposed as being again imagine my shock a Hillary Clinton sicker fan again this is the
[3:17:33.800 --> 3:17:41.080]  woman who wrote the article before the election October 2016 for Heat Street claiming that we
[3:17:41.080 --> 3:17:47.000]  were working with Russian troll bots this is the individual this is the source this is also the
[3:17:47.000 --> 3:17:53.800]  woman who was exposed in WikiLeaks emails the John Podesta emails as being a Hillary Clinton
[3:17:53.800 --> 3:17:59.640]  sicker fan this is out of Breitbart WikiLeaks anti SJW Heat Street founder Louise Menz she
[3:17:59.640 --> 3:18:05.640]  poses as a conservative she's a never-trumper pitched ad script to Hillary Clinton campaign
[3:18:06.440 --> 3:18:14.200]  and it goes through and quotes the email where she prostrates herself and genuflex to Podesta
[3:18:14.200 --> 3:18:21.720]  to the Hillary Clinton campaign begging to allow her to write this feminist Hillary Clinton ad
[3:18:21.720 --> 3:18:30.200]  this is the source of the FBI's investigation into these claims she wrote a huge rambling article
[3:18:30.200 --> 3:18:35.720]  claiming that we were working with Russian troll bots it was completely debunked completely
[3:18:35.720 --> 3:18:43.480]  eviscerated in the months since she went basically further off the wagon with more crazy claims such
[3:18:43.480 --> 3:18:49.480]  as the ones you just heard in that interview she's basically a laughing stock in the journalism world
[3:18:49.480 --> 3:18:56.680]  and this is the impeccable source which the FBI is now investigating the claims that originated
[3:18:56.680 --> 3:19:05.880]  with her absolutely ludicrous as our article up on info wars dot com details it also details
[3:19:05.880 --> 3:19:12.120]  the fact that again the Stanford University study found fake news had no impact on the outcome of
[3:19:12.120 --> 3:19:17.720]  the election so before you even get into an argument about who was behind so-called fake news
[3:19:17.720 --> 3:19:25.560]  didn't even matter Trump would have won anyway in fact as i said the fake news benefited Hillary
[3:19:25.560 --> 3:19:31.960]  more than Trump that's what the study found the fake news about Hillary was more beneficial towards
[3:19:31.960 --> 3:19:38.200]  her campaign it circulated more on social media then we're going to get into facebook we're going
[3:19:38.200 --> 3:19:45.080]  to get into google we're going to get into twitter how they provably manipulated their own algorithms
[3:19:45.080 --> 3:19:51.400]  directed their own employees to bury conservative friendly news topics throughout the election
[3:19:51.400 --> 3:19:57.560]  to benefit Hillary Clinton they did what the FBI is accusing us of doing will be right back

[3:26:11.400 --> 3:26:17.640]  store dot com finishing up on what we were talking about before the break again louise mensch the
[3:26:17.640 --> 3:26:23.640]  woman who thinks she has superpowers to spot patterns that other people just can't the woman who wrote
[3:26:23.640 --> 3:26:31.480]  a fawning email to john podesta to the clinton campaign begging genuflecting for them to allow
[3:26:31.480 --> 3:26:37.720]  her to write this feminist hillary campaign ad she's the source of this ridiculous conspiracy
[3:26:37.720 --> 3:26:43.720]  theory that we were working with the russian troll box to sink hillary clinton to ensure donald
[3:26:43.720 --> 3:26:50.600]  trump from the presidency she's the source of that not a very credible source to say the least
[3:26:50.600 --> 3:26:56.200]  but then you can look at twitter you can look at facebook you can look at google again if the fbi
[3:26:56.200 --> 3:27:03.880]  wants to investigate someone for manipulating public opinion before the election twitter facebook
[3:27:03.880 --> 3:27:09.400]  google are the prime suspects and we document that in this article up on info wars dot com red
[3:27:09.400 --> 3:27:16.040]  linked why the fbi's info wars russia investigation is completely ludicrous and i break it down
[3:27:16.760 --> 3:27:22.040]  two months before the election and we reported on it at the time psychologist robert eppstein and
[3:27:22.040 --> 3:27:28.600]  source feeds matt Lieberman both exposed how google was manipulating search results in relation to
[3:27:28.600 --> 3:27:35.960]  hillary clinton to ensure autocomplete suggestions were bias in favor of clinton that is a quote
[3:27:35.960 --> 3:27:41.560]  oh and you see an example in the article we include the screenshot people would type in
[3:27:42.120 --> 3:27:49.800]  hillary clinton is into a google search engine google only returned positive search results
[3:27:49.800 --> 3:27:56.600]  you type the same search term into other search engines such as bing and yahoo you got different
[3:27:56.600 --> 3:28:01.880]  suggested results you got hillary clinton is a liar or hillary clinton is a criminal
[3:28:01.880 --> 3:28:07.160]  what did you get on google dot com you can see the example right there if you zoom in
[3:28:07.720 --> 3:28:13.640]  basically hillary clinton is god bow down and worship her and of course we know google is
[3:28:13.640 --> 3:28:18.600]  deeply in bed with the obama administration according to eppstein the psychologist who was
[3:28:18.600 --> 3:28:26.760]  quoted by source feed this had the potential to shift as many as three million votes google
[3:28:26.760 --> 3:28:33.400]  directly manipulating its own search engine in favor of hillary clinton direct evidence of what
[3:28:33.400 --> 3:28:39.800]  they accuse us of doing with no evidence wikileaks emails also revealed that john podesta hillary's
[3:28:39.800 --> 3:28:44.840]  campaign manager sorts have quote discrete conversation with the likes of apple facebook
[3:28:44.840 --> 3:28:51.160]  and google then you look at facebook mark zuckerberg wanted to meet up with the clinton campaign
[3:28:51.160 --> 3:28:57.320]  their chief operating officer sheryl sandberg did meet with clinton chief of staff sheryl mills in
[3:28:57.320 --> 3:29:06.360]  2015 and we also know the story of how facebook buried conservative trends removed them from their
[3:29:06.360 --> 3:29:12.440]  trending list ordered their employees to remove conservative friendly trends and inject fake
[3:29:12.440 --> 3:29:18.920]  artificial trends into that list again to manipulate public opinion you look at twitter
[3:29:18.920 --> 3:29:24.280]  burying hashtags that were negative towards hillary clinton which hillary and which hillary
[3:29:24.280 --> 3:29:31.080]  censored those hashtags were banned that was manipulating public opinion there are numerous
[3:29:31.080 --> 3:29:38.200]  more examples where twitter facebook google were caught doing what the fbi accusers us of doing
[3:29:38.200 --> 3:29:44.360]  with absolutely no evidence whatsoever we'll be back on the alex john show live breaking news

[3:33:14.440 --> 3:33:28.920]  joseph watson we are back on the alex jones show live and you know it's interesting rasmussen reports
[3:33:28.920 --> 3:33:35.560]  came out with a poll today saying that 50 percent of likely us voters approved of president trump's
[3:33:35.560 --> 3:33:40.920]  job performance so basically has a 50 percent approval rating that contradicts with the poll
[3:33:40.920 --> 3:33:48.360]  released by gallup yesterday which said that only 37 percent of americans supported trump
[3:33:48.360 --> 3:33:55.720]  that he only had a 37 percent approval rating the question is who is gallup sampling who are they
[3:33:55.720 --> 3:34:01.560]  asking to get this result given the wide margin of difference between the gallup poll and the
[3:34:01.560 --> 3:34:09.880]  rasmussen poll a 13 different well i asked gallup to provide their sampling i've got a website where
[3:34:09.880 --> 3:34:15.400]  it says contact gallup if you want further information on the sampling for our polls so i did that
[3:34:15.400 --> 3:34:24.520]  via email via twitter 28 hours ago now no response nothing whatsoever i was simply asking give me
[3:34:24.520 --> 3:34:29.960]  information on the sampling for your poll how many democrats did you ask how many independents
[3:34:29.960 --> 3:34:35.800]  did you ask how many republicans did you ask because of course before the election and this was one
[3:34:35.800 --> 3:34:42.040]  of the reasons why people were so shocked that hoffington post could report hillary clinton 98
[3:34:42.680 --> 3:34:48.200]  chance of winning the election and then for her to lose of course the polls before the election
[3:34:48.200 --> 3:34:54.280]  oversampled democrats in almost every case you can look at the polls for the debates
[3:34:55.080 --> 3:35:01.960]  and the immediate aftermath of the debates the cnn orc polls always oversampled democrats because
[3:35:01.960 --> 3:35:08.920]  of course that makes it more likely to get the result they want so only 37 percent approval
[3:35:08.920 --> 3:35:14.600]  rating for trump according to this gallup poll who are they sampling who are they asking well i asked
[3:35:14.600 --> 3:35:22.360]  them and they have completely failed to provide an answer more than 24 hours later unacceptable
[3:35:22.360 --> 3:35:27.640]  which of course suggests that they're hiding something they don't even put it on their website
[3:35:27.640 --> 3:35:34.360]  how simple would it be to say this poll sampled x percent of democrats x percent of independents
[3:35:34.360 --> 3:35:39.960]  x percent of republicans they don't do that and when you ask them about it they don't respond
[3:35:40.680 --> 3:35:46.520]  very suspicious if this is a fair poll give us the sampling and we'll move on but they
[3:35:46.520 --> 3:35:55.000]  haven't done that more than 24 hours later very interesting indeed we have a top story up on
[3:35:55.000 --> 3:36:02.440]  info was dot com i posted this about an hour ago study one third of young muslims in france think
[3:36:02.440 --> 3:36:09.080]  terrorism is acceptable oh religion of peace strikes again so basically they had this big study
[3:36:09.080 --> 3:36:17.080]  conducted immediately after the paris attacks in 2015 november 13 attacks they asked almost 7000
[3:36:17.080 --> 3:36:24.280]  high school students in france 25 percent of whom were muslims they asked them a bunch of different
[3:36:24.280 --> 3:36:31.000]  questions what did they discover they discovered and bearing in mind this study has been received
[3:36:31.000 --> 3:36:37.800]  very badly by the french media because it's quote not politically correct it literally says that in
[3:36:37.800 --> 3:36:44.040]  one of the articles that we have to be very careful about the results of this study because the facts
[3:36:44.040 --> 3:36:49.800]  are not politically correct well the facts are the facts are the facts and these are the facts
[3:36:49.800 --> 3:36:55.080]  according to this study a young muslim is four times more likely to adhere to radical beliefs
[3:36:55.080 --> 3:37:02.840]  than a christian 33 percent of muslim students in this poll consider it acceptable that's a quote
[3:37:02.840 --> 3:37:12.760]  acceptable to quote participate in violent actions for ideas which is obviously terrorism
[3:37:12.760 --> 3:37:19.560]  violence in pursuit of political goals is terrorism that's the very definition of terrorism
[3:37:19.560 --> 3:37:27.160]  33 percent of young muslims asked in this survey said they found that acceptable 20 percent of
[3:37:27.160 --> 3:37:33.480]  muslim students agreed with the statement that it was acceptable to stand up for your religion with
[3:37:33.480 --> 3:37:41.000]  weapons and again bear in mind these are the ones who just admit to it if you have 33 percent of
[3:37:41.000 --> 3:37:46.440]  muslim students saying that they're sympathetic with terrorism using violence to further your
[3:37:46.440 --> 3:37:53.160]  ideological goals how many of them didn't admit to that but believed it anyway you know we had a
[3:37:53.160 --> 3:37:58.600]  poll in the uk a few months back 52 percent of muslims living in the uk think homosexuality
[3:37:58.600 --> 3:38:05.080]  should be criminalized they think gay people should be thrown in cages but again 52 percent
[3:38:05.080 --> 3:38:11.400]  a majority but how many of them didn't admit to it after all the quran says that you can lie to
[3:38:11.400 --> 3:38:17.160]  infidels so how many more believe it but don't admit to it but even the ones that do admit to it
[3:38:17.160 --> 3:38:24.680]  those numbers are shocking enough 24 percent of those surveyed in this study out of the whole sample
[3:38:24.680 --> 3:38:32.600]  bearing in mind only 25 percent of this sample of muslims the other 75 percent on but still 24
[3:38:32.600 --> 3:38:39.400]  percent of those surveyed refused to fully condemn the charlie hebdo killings 24 percent
[3:38:39.400 --> 3:38:47.160]  of young people in this poll of almost 7 000 students in france and again that's the whole
[3:38:47.160 --> 3:38:53.160]  sample that's not just amongst muslims and yet you've still got a number of 24 percent refusing
[3:38:53.160 --> 3:39:00.760]  to fully condemn the massacre of the charlie hebdo cartoonists bataclan massacre which of course
[3:39:00.760 --> 3:39:07.480]  happened during the november 13 paris attack absolutely horrific incident 89 people dead
[3:39:07.480 --> 3:39:15.960]  21 percent of students surveyed in this poll refused to fully condemn the bataclan massacre
[3:39:15.960 --> 3:39:22.840]  again that is the whole survey if you broke it down which they didn't conveniently enough because
[3:39:22.840 --> 3:39:29.400]  we can't break it down too much can we because again that's not politically correct to know the
[3:39:29.400 --> 3:39:35.320]  truth but if you broke it down if you only took the muslim students out of that poll that number
[3:39:35.320 --> 3:39:41.640]  would of course be way higher now we've seen this kind of thing before but this just emphasizes it
[3:39:41.640 --> 3:39:49.800]  once again because we had the pew global attitudes today in 2006 which found that 42 percent of
[3:39:49.800 --> 3:39:58.520]  muslims in france aged between 18 and 29 so young muslims living in france 42 percent of them thought
[3:39:58.520 --> 3:40:06.840]  that suicide bombings were sometimes justified so you've got almost half of young muslims in
[3:40:06.840 --> 3:40:14.520]  france who think that under certain circumstances suicide bombings are justified and these opinions
[3:40:14.520 --> 3:40:18.760]  are echoed across europe they're even worse when you look at attitudes in the middle east
[3:40:19.480 --> 3:40:26.120]  islam is not a religion of peace we've proven it again and again and again how did lamonde react
[3:40:26.120 --> 3:40:32.920]  to this survey the left-wing french newspaper well they attacked the researchers for stating the fact
[3:40:33.560 --> 3:40:38.920]  they said that it was like opening pandora's box because god forbid we would learn the truth
[3:40:39.560 --> 3:40:43.800]  and in these articles which are in french they were translated by the west monster website
[3:40:45.240 --> 3:40:49.880]  they basically say we have to withhold the full results of this study we can't break it down too
[3:40:49.880 --> 3:40:56.840]  much we have to delay the release of this further until after the election the first round of which
[3:40:56.840 --> 3:41:03.640]  takes place in about a month's time and of course marine le penne is the anti-immigration
[3:41:03.640 --> 3:41:09.240]  candidate they don't want this to benefit her so they're talking about delaying the release of the
[3:41:09.240 --> 3:41:18.040]  full results censorship because again as one of the journalist remarks these results are not
[3:41:18.040 --> 3:41:24.600]  politically correct we don't want the public to know the full scope of what is happening
[3:41:24.600 --> 3:41:31.960]  in france where on an almost daily basis there is some kind of terrorist incident now a few days
[3:41:31.960 --> 3:41:38.600]  ago we had a son and a his father and his son having their throat slashed in the street in a
[3:41:38.600 --> 3:41:44.440]  quote trendy area of paris we had the incident a few days ago at the airport second biggest
[3:41:44.440 --> 3:41:52.120]  airport in paris again jihadist tries to grab a soldier's gun tries to go on a rampage luckily
[3:41:52.120 --> 3:41:57.720]  shot dead before he could do any damage we have some kind of incident almost every single day in
[3:41:57.720 --> 3:42:07.080]  france we've had 20 jihadist attacks in france since january 2015 alone since charlie hebdo 20
[3:42:07.080 --> 3:42:15.480]  jihadist attacks in france alone and is it any surprise given these attitudes amongst young
[3:42:15.480 --> 3:42:21.960]  muslims most of whom were born in france they're not even new immigrants these are the supposedly
[3:42:21.960 --> 3:42:29.080]  integrated ones this is the cultural enrichment that is taking place in europe it's absolutely
[3:42:29.080 --> 3:42:34.760]  chilling of course what they're afraid of is the fact that as i mentioned earlier marine le penne
[3:42:34.760 --> 3:42:44.360]  has 39 percent support amongst 18 to 24 year old french voters in france 39 percent that's almost
[3:42:44.360 --> 3:42:51.320]  double her nearest rival macron who is leading in the polls but le penne has almost double
[3:42:51.880 --> 3:42:57.320]  the support amongst young people and again it's because the major parties have completely neglected
[3:42:58.280 --> 3:43:03.080]  young people they only have support now amongst older people who are just desperate
[3:43:03.080 --> 3:43:08.680]  to keep their pensions and think that le penne is going to take away their pensions but again that
[3:43:08.680 --> 3:43:15.800]  emphasizes populism is the new counterculture increasingly we're capturing the youth vote
[3:43:16.440 --> 3:43:24.920]  every other message i get is from somebody aged 15 16 17 it's really encouraging to see that and
[3:43:24.920 --> 3:43:31.080]  it's encouraging to see it in france but is it really any surprise given these horrific numbers
[3:43:31.080 --> 3:43:38.280]  that we see in this poll with young muslims thinking that a third of them thinking that
[3:43:38.280 --> 3:43:45.960]  terrorism under certain circumstances is acceptable absolutely chilling meanwhile over in sweden
[3:43:47.240 --> 3:43:53.320]  my favorite country last night in sweden sweden has let in about 150 isis terrorists of course
[3:43:53.320 --> 3:43:58.680]  it's routinely in the top three for exporting terrorists to syria and iraq to fight for isis
[3:43:58.680 --> 3:44:03.640]  they let them back in because they're liberal because they're tolerant they're progressive
[3:44:04.200 --> 3:44:11.800]  in many cases in some cases in some cities the swedes are offering returning isis fighters jobs
[3:44:12.440 --> 3:44:19.320]  homes welfare payments yeah that's not fake news that's been reported over and over again
[3:44:19.320 --> 3:44:27.720]  they're actually offering islamic state fighters welfare not even should we turn them away at the
[3:44:27.720 --> 3:44:31.480]  border they've beheaded people should we just let them back in yeah just let them in we're tolerant
[3:44:31.480 --> 3:44:38.520]  we're progressive now they set up a hotline they didn't say let's turn them away let's not let these
[3:44:38.520 --> 3:44:44.760]  bloodthirsty jihadist killers back into our supposedly liberal country no that wasn't even
[3:44:44.760 --> 3:44:51.720]  up for consideration they just let them back in but they set up a terrorist hotline so people
[3:44:51.720 --> 3:44:57.320]  who saw something suspicious could call in and report one of these isis terrorists which the
[3:44:57.320 --> 3:45:02.920]  government had let back into the country then they shut down the terrorist hotline because
[3:45:02.920 --> 3:45:10.520]  they thought it might be encouraging racism that's what's happening in sweden today absolutely
[3:45:10.520 --> 3:45:17.480]  insane meanwhile their government is reopening cold war bunkers over fears of russian invasion
[3:45:18.440 --> 3:45:23.480]  shelters on the Baltic island of gotland will be prioritized for comprehensive checks after it was
[3:45:23.480 --> 3:45:29.000]  identified as a likely target for russian invasion last year sweden's most populous island has been
[3:45:29.000 --> 3:45:34.600]  the site of a dramatic build-up of military training more than a decade after being demilitarized
[3:45:35.480 --> 3:45:43.480]  so they're reopening hundreds of cold war bunkers on this island this is the target supposedly they
[3:45:43.480 --> 3:45:50.360]  claim of russian invasion plans they spent nine billion dollars during the cold war to build
[3:45:50.360 --> 3:45:55.720]  nuclear bunkers so they've got enough to shelter 80 percent of the population but they've got a
[3:45:55.720 --> 3:46:01.800]  problem because they're letting in so many foreign immigrants that let more and more people
[3:46:02.360 --> 3:46:07.640]  are not going to be protected in the very worst case scenario so now they're having to go through
[3:46:08.200 --> 3:46:14.440]  all these checks reopen these bunkers the swedish civil contingencies agency says that
[3:46:14.440 --> 3:46:22.040]  that the country's municipalities need to prepare for war they've brought back compulsory military
[3:46:22.040 --> 3:46:27.160]  service for young people they're short of soldiers they're basically freaking out but they're not
[3:46:27.160 --> 3:46:32.600]  freaking out about the fact that they're just letting ISIS jihadists back into the country
[3:46:32.600 --> 3:46:38.840]  the fact that areas of stock home and malmo are on fire every night they have riots all the time
[3:46:38.840 --> 3:46:44.600]  murders are going through the roof they've got the highest rape rate in europe no that's not what
[3:46:44.600 --> 3:46:51.400]  they're concerned about they're concerned about russia invading them that's what's going on in
[3:46:51.400 --> 3:46:57.880]  sweden while the mainstream media still pretends that it's all hunky dory it's a liberal paradise
[3:46:58.600 --> 3:47:03.480]  meanwhile in holland where they just had the election this is out of westmonster.com
[3:47:03.480 --> 3:47:09.560]  dutch election dutch education ministry teach migrant kids in foreign language so they've
[3:47:09.560 --> 3:47:15.560]  just given up on the integration all together now in an example of staggering stupidity the dutch
[3:47:15.560 --> 3:47:20.200]  education ministry has recommended to primary schools that they teach the children of asylum
[3:47:20.200 --> 3:47:26.760]  seekers and migrants using the language of where they came rather than just teaching them dutch
[3:47:26.760 --> 3:47:32.600]  so they've basically given up on integrating them and say yeah we'll just teach them in arabic
[3:47:33.320 --> 3:47:39.240]  we'll just turn over our entire society in sweden that they're now creating glossaries
[3:47:39.240 --> 3:47:45.160]  for new workers on construction sites where every single term is translated into arabic again
[3:47:46.040 --> 3:47:52.120]  the owners should be on them to learn swedish and dutch not on the entire society of holland
[3:47:52.120 --> 3:47:58.840]  and sweden to change to become arabic but that's what happens when you just allow people in they
[3:47:58.840 --> 3:48:04.520]  congregate into ghettos they radicalize they create more terrorism they create more sexual
[3:48:04.520 --> 3:48:10.920]  assaults they're responsible for more crime that's what's happening in europe and now in holland
[3:48:10.920 --> 3:48:17.400]  they've just given up all together on integrating people by trying to teach them dutch now they're
[3:48:17.400 --> 3:48:24.120]  just going to teach them in arabic this is up on enforce.com globalist will force EU to accept
[3:48:24.120 --> 3:48:29.800]  more muslim migrants the european union's immigration commissioner says the bloc has the tools the
[3:48:29.800 --> 3:48:36.760]  means and the power to force EU member states to accept muslim migrants demetris avramopolis
[3:48:36.760 --> 3:48:41.560]  greece's commissioner for the EU's common immigration and asylum policy made the comments
[3:48:41.560 --> 3:48:46.440]  during a visit to poland so they're basically threatening european countries with economic
[3:48:46.440 --> 3:48:54.760]  penalties if they don't accept more migrants even as erdogan in turkey over and over again
[3:48:54.760 --> 3:49:01.080]  threatens to use the migrant wave as a weapon against european countries if they don't give
[3:49:01.080 --> 3:49:07.640]  him more money if they don't allow him to campaign politically in europe as we saw a couple of weeks
[3:49:07.640 --> 3:49:13.400]  ago with the islamist rioting on the streets of rhododam and amsterdam chanting al-akbar
[3:49:13.400 --> 3:49:22.120]  but again that's key know how erdogan characterizes the migrants not as desperate suffering refugees
[3:49:22.120 --> 3:49:29.880]  but as a weapon to be used against the west and he's done that over and over again and you've
[3:49:29.880 --> 3:49:33.160]  got a hand you've got to put your hands up to him i mean at least he's being honest right
[3:49:33.720 --> 3:49:39.000]  given what we've seen happening in europe so that's what we've got happening in holland
[3:49:39.000 --> 3:49:45.640]  in the netherlands now we have top globalists saying you better start accepting more or we're
[3:49:45.640 --> 3:49:52.440]  going to hit you with more financial penalties big bang theory star confronts leftist for ignoring

[3:55:35.320 --> 3:55:43.720]  infowarslife.com a few final stories here bbc reports historical dramas limit uk black actors
[3:55:44.360 --> 3:55:49.320]  this again is another one of those things where they have to filter everything through the lens
[3:55:49.320 --> 3:55:55.400]  of social justice actress dandy newton has said she can't work in the uk because there are no
[3:55:55.400 --> 3:56:01.080]  roles for black and minority ethnic actors in historical dramas london born newton said the
[3:56:01.080 --> 3:56:07.080]  number of costume dramas had led to slim pickings for people of color a criticism comes after the
[3:56:07.080 --> 3:56:14.200]  british film institute research found that 59% of uk films since 2006 had no black actors in any
[3:56:14.200 --> 3:56:21.560]  role well the problem with not including black actors in historical dramas is if you did include
[3:56:21.560 --> 3:56:31.640]  black actors in historical dramas set in england 200 years ago they would cease to be historical that's
[3:56:31.640 --> 3:56:38.280]  the frigging point if you want it to be historically accurate you have to accurately represent the people
[3:56:38.280 --> 3:56:45.160]  who were living in england for example in the 1800s very few black people were living in england
[3:56:45.160 --> 3:56:51.160]  in the in the 1800s so obviously there aren't going to be a large number of roles for black actors
[3:56:51.160 --> 3:56:57.080]  it's like if you were doing a production about nigeria in the 1920s and you were complaining
[3:56:57.080 --> 3:57:01.960]  about there not being enough white people in the production well of course there's not going to be
[3:57:01.960 --> 3:57:08.200]  white people in it it's in nigeria even if it was set in nigeria now there'd be no white people in it
[3:57:08.760 --> 3:57:14.440]  that's the reason it's not nothing to do with racism but again everything in the arts everything
[3:57:14.440 --> 3:57:21.880]  in theater everything in cinema has to be filtered through this lens of social justice they're making
[3:57:21.880 --> 3:57:26.680]  everything crappy in fact i got another video coming out on modern art which will probably be
[3:57:26.680 --> 3:57:34.600]  out tomorrow which covers that very issue a couple of stories left cbs san francisco reports
[3:57:34.600 --> 3:57:40.440]  tattoo removal business booming as fears of deportation mount an east bay tattoo removal
[3:57:40.440 --> 3:57:45.160]  clinic says they've treated a record number of clients since the election some in the latino
[3:57:45.160 --> 3:57:50.120]  community worry ice agents will use their tattoos as an excuse to stop them and check immigration
[3:57:50.120 --> 3:57:56.680]  status so of course we know that many of these illegal immigrants have gang tattoos how they're
[3:57:56.680 --> 3:58:01.720]  getting them all removed because they think ice is going to stop them use that as an excuse
[3:58:02.360 --> 3:58:08.280]  to basically deport them that is a reflection of what's happening as donald trump continues
[3:58:08.280 --> 3:58:13.880]  to build the wall that's going to wrap it up for this edition of the alex joneshow but again
[3:58:13.880 --> 3:58:19.160]  get the article out up on info wars dot com why the fbi's info wars russia investigation
[3:58:19.160 --> 3:58:24.440]  is completely ludicrous where being accused of something that twitter facebook and google
[3:58:24.440 --> 3:58:30.200]  have done on a regular basis they're the ones manipulating public opinion this is a ruse to
[3:58:30.200 --> 3:58:35.000]  censor info wars so we really need your support that's going to wrap it up break your news at info
[3:58:35.000 --> 3:58:41.000]  wars dot com
