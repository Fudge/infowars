[00:00.000 --> 00:11.960]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.960 --> 00:19.500]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.500 --> 00:27.320]  Texas Alex Jones all right we have a very important extremely informative jam
[00:27.320 --> 00:43.520]  packed friends a mission lined up for you today it is Tuesday the seventh day of
[00:43.520 --> 00:51.140]  April 2009 we've got Michael Rivera joining us for his monthly appearance
[00:51.140 --> 00:56.300]  coming up in the next hour will be simulcasting at prisonplanet.tv he'll
[00:56.300 --> 01:12.340]  be joining us from Hawaii via video cam then Carol deli will be joining us we'll
[01:12.340 --> 01:18.700]  be discussing what happened to her son's murderer remember about eight months
[01:18.700 --> 01:23.380]  ago eight months and a week ago he was brutally murdered while sleeping on a
[01:23.380 --> 01:29.780]  gray on bus the person ate his eyeballs chopped his head off stabbed him over a
[01:29.780 --> 01:34.060]  hundred times and they're talking about releasing him from jail so I thought we
[01:34.060 --> 01:37.140]  just been 30 minutes on that just to illustrate how crazy the criminal
[01:37.140 --> 01:41.820]  justice system is not just in Canada but the United States but that but if he
[01:41.820 --> 01:47.660]  was a pot smoker he'd stay in prison but if you're completely psychopathic
[01:47.660 --> 01:55.140]  schizophrenic well then now you get to get out of prison so that is coming up
[01:55.140 --> 02:00.260]  in the meantime I have a huge host of issues that need to be covered here
[02:00.260 --> 02:07.540]  today first off we have some good news and I'm gonna get into details later in
[02:07.540 --> 02:14.860]  the hour the good news is the Pittsburgh post dispatch in two separate
[02:14.860 --> 02:22.180]  articles has retracted its statement that the three-time cop killer he also
[02:22.180 --> 02:28.180]  wounded two others was a fan of this show was influenced by this radio show
[02:28.180 --> 02:34.700]  because they actually went and found his comments on Stormfront info wars my
[02:34.700 --> 02:44.180]  space where he was criticizing me and attacking me he was also a fan of the
[02:44.180 --> 02:53.260]  penguins is that a hockey team so I guess it's the penguins fault you know
[02:53.260 --> 02:59.460]  this is just ridiculous he also was a fan of pit bulls and he'd just gotten
[02:59.460 --> 03:03.020]  two pit bulls they were urinating all over his mother's house this was a
[03:03.020 --> 03:07.060]  domestic disturbance he wasn't out cruising the streets ready for war with
[03:07.060 --> 03:11.940]  the police as the media tried to spin it he was a spoiled brat 22 years old
[03:11.940 --> 03:17.260]  living in home with mommy yeah you gotta love it he's out of work so he goes
[03:17.260 --> 03:22.580]  and gets two pit bulls he's living with mommy you know if you want to have dogs
[03:22.580 --> 03:27.060]  that's one thing is I love dogs but until you've got your house in order your
[03:27.060 --> 03:30.700]  ship in order you shouldn't have them so the dogs are running around urinating
[03:30.700 --> 03:35.260]  all over the house he's out drunk that night before he comes home he's been
[03:35.260 --> 03:41.580]  asleep about three hours his dogs are urinating everywhere his mother says
[03:41.580 --> 03:47.780]  get rid of the dogs he screams at her gets in her face starts waving guns
[03:47.780 --> 03:53.020]  around she calls the police and says he's got guns be careful and the 911
[03:53.020 --> 03:57.940]  worker according to the Associated Press didn't tell the police he was
[03:57.940 --> 04:05.140]  waiting with guns and so they walked right into a death trap with a you know
[04:05.140 --> 04:07.820]  these guys that burned down their house with their wives and children and these
[04:07.820 --> 04:14.140]  these people that do this it's a form of throwing a fit it's a big tantrum that's
[04:14.140 --> 04:21.420]  what this is and it's because there's lack of discipline in this country you
[04:21.420 --> 04:24.940]  know in every case we've seen where it's a mass shooting or somebody goes into a
[04:24.940 --> 04:29.620]  church or a school or wherever with the guns they're on prozac type drugs every
[04:29.620 --> 04:38.540]  case but when it's separate cases like this they're always a mama's boy and I
[04:38.540 --> 04:43.180]  don't understand the connection between being a mama's boy and throwing fits and
[04:43.180 --> 04:49.060]  killing people for no reason but anyways that's a side issue the media is being
[04:49.060 --> 04:53.860]  forced to print retraction after retraction connecting me to this and
[04:53.860 --> 04:57.340]  that's a good thing we'll be right back
[05:00.180 --> 05:05.340]  you already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important

[05:09.460 --> 05:13.420]  the water you drink should be at a pH level of eight or higher alcovision
[05:13.420 --> 05:18.700]  plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients using

[08:02.300 --> 08:09.420]  t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:10.140 --> 08:16.300]  okay we got sidetracked Sunday and Monday
[08:17.060 --> 08:22.500]  with all the shootings the one up in New York State killing 14 people including
[08:22.500 --> 08:29.420]  himself the 14th that lunatic throwing a fit because he'd lost his job
[08:29.420 --> 08:36.420]  just amazing as the media advertises this is the thing to do oh you lose your
[08:36.420 --> 08:41.020]  job is walking someplace and shoot a bunch of people and it's like somebody
[08:41.020 --> 08:44.340]  flipped a light switch now that Obama's in office in the in the mass shootings
[08:44.340 --> 08:49.580]  are just going off the charts but the light switch is to the economy being
[08:49.580 --> 08:54.060]  shut down by the bankers so we got distracted by that then I had the
[08:54.060 --> 09:00.340]  Pittsburgh Post-Cosette the ADL and others come out and basically say that
[09:00.340 --> 09:07.380]  the shooter in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania Richard Paolozkes Paolozkes that he'd
[09:07.380 --> 09:10.780]  been influenced by info wars dot com and prison planet dot com without a
[09:10.780 --> 09:15.500]  shred of proof and then we found out what their supposed proof was they knew
[09:15.500 --> 09:19.260]  his handle because the police had shut down as my space but they had his handle
[09:19.260 --> 09:23.780]  they'd done a google search and found him on a whole bunch of websites but they
[09:23.780 --> 09:29.780]  chose to go after storm front and info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[09:29.780 --> 09:34.620]  now he was worshipful on storm front the number one white supremacist website
[09:34.620 --> 09:40.140]  but he was criticizing me and attacking me on all the posts we went and found it
[09:40.140 --> 09:43.700]  once the newspapers finally and subsequent conversations said we're
[09:43.700 --> 09:48.540]  oh here he is saying I'm bad here he is saying he disagrees with me here he is
[09:48.540 --> 09:52.620]  disagreeing that this needs to be peaceful he says this needs to be a hot
[09:52.620 --> 09:56.580]  war this needs to start there needs to be a revolution this needs to be taken to
[09:56.580 --> 10:05.620]  the streets and so we got this material posted it yesterday and raw story has
[10:05.620 --> 10:10.900]  retracted daily cost is retracted two separate articles have retracted in the
[10:10.900 --> 10:18.500]  Pittsburgh Post-Cosette okay saying yes he was critical of Alex Jones and his
[10:18.500 --> 10:25.660]  views were against Alex Jones so there you have it and this is just like with
[10:25.660 --> 10:30.060]  the Michelle Malcolm when there's these guys who came with the other three blogs
[10:30.060 --> 10:36.820]  that were with her at the DNC I'm told hey there's a protest down at the US
[10:36.820 --> 10:43.100]  Mint by the local recreate 68 group that had been openly attacking me on the web
[10:43.100 --> 10:46.340]  and saying I was horrible and had an anarchist walking up and shoving me and
[10:46.340 --> 10:50.580]  hitting on me as I walked up to the mint I get to the mint they're dressed up in
[10:50.580 --> 10:56.660]  wizard outfit saying they're levitating the mint and I laugh at them of course
[10:56.660 --> 10:59.860]  they're paid there to make protests look ridiculous that's why they act like
[10:59.860 --> 11:03.700]  clowns and I go though there's Michelle Malcolm so I go over to her and get in
[11:03.700 --> 11:06.500]  her face and say you wrote a book saying put Americans in camps without rights
[11:06.500 --> 11:10.460]  and her bodyguard slash guy started to kind of bump it into me so I pushed him
[11:10.460 --> 11:16.020]  right back and then then I'd be following her and he'd get in front of me an
[11:16.020 --> 11:18.980]  elbow he saw the elbow right back you know I'm not backing down to this stuff
[11:18.980 --> 11:24.060]  and just like when Michael Moore's bodyguard shoves me in martial law I
[11:24.060 --> 11:28.100]  just ran right into him with pleasure and the guy wants to go ahead and throw a
[11:28.100 --> 11:32.340]  punch go ahead just throw the first punch on camera because frankly I'll
[11:32.340 --> 11:36.300]  open up a big can on you and it's not because I'm some tough guy it's you hit
[11:36.300 --> 11:41.820]  me I hit back I can't control myself it's real simple so anyway side issue I'm
[11:41.820 --> 11:47.460]  sitting there and there's these frat guys dressed up in Obama outfits and
[11:47.460 --> 11:53.340]  they're screaming kill Michelle Malcolm on video and Malcolm and them all put it
[11:53.340 --> 11:56.340]  out that I'm saying killer and then it turns out these guys left with the
[11:56.340 --> 12:01.540]  blogs with her well you know we had radio affiliates calling it going Alex we
[12:01.540 --> 12:04.900]  can't have you saying kill a woman we may drop your show and oh my god and
[12:04.900 --> 12:07.660]  thank god we got the video out showing it was them and that they were with her
[12:07.660 --> 12:15.460]  and then it backfired we got even more stations but I could have handled it
[12:15.460 --> 12:21.740]  better to watch my back I'm getting to learn now this latest thing really blew
[12:21.740 --> 12:30.220]  up in the establishment's face yet again this bloop in their face in a big way
[12:32.260 --> 12:36.500]  so I'm gonna get more into this right now and then coming up I'm gonna debunk
[12:36.500 --> 12:44.180]  Glenn Beck now again I'm not that smart of a guy I just spend 24 7 I had an 18
[12:44.180 --> 12:48.980]  hour day yesterday with pleasure and to make myself go home sat into the end of
[12:48.980 --> 12:53.140]  the show with Burma's last night then worked on the film and then left but the
[12:53.140 --> 13:00.980]  issue here is that Glenn Beck I told everybody that Glenn Beck had gone off
[13:00.980 --> 13:05.860]  FBI talking points in the past I mean these were direct ADL southern
[13:05.860 --> 13:10.140]  Harvey Law Center anti-conservative talking points linking us to McVeigh and
[13:10.140 --> 13:14.100]  white supremacist their favorite deal and he did that on show after show in the
[13:14.100 --> 13:16.980]  last year and a half and then he goes oh I'm a patriot I believe in the New
[13:16.980 --> 13:20.380]  World Order I'm gonna investigate it and tell you if it's real and I said folks
[13:20.380 --> 13:24.300]  it's gonna be a hit piece he's gonna say the camps aren't real and and I said
[13:24.300 --> 13:30.540]  watch he's gonna go to the Amtrak train facility because that's the only viral
[13:30.540 --> 13:38.100]  video out since 1995 by Linda Thompson that isn't true and three weeks ago I
[13:38.100 --> 13:41.260]  predicted it and last week I predicted it yesterday I predicted it and sure
[13:41.260 --> 13:48.420]  enough sure enough it's the exact Amtrak video exactly what I know and this isn't
[13:48.420 --> 13:52.740]  hard every time they try to debunk Waco you know you have the government's own
[13:52.740 --> 13:55.940]  flare footage on shooting the Davidians congressional testimony the Delta
[13:55.940 --> 13:59.180]  force was there and carried out quote combat operations with extreme
[13:59.180 --> 14:02.460]  prejudice and killed the people inside but a shape-charge in the church records
[14:02.460 --> 14:05.980]  vault building that's all come out in the congressional hearings you just never
[14:05.980 --> 14:10.220]  saw it on the nightly news what does the media do when they debunk us they go to
[14:10.220 --> 14:15.140]  Linda Thompson who if anybody was a fed it was her she wanted a violent march on
[14:15.140 --> 14:19.380]  Washington to quote kill all the senators and then they they swooped up a
[14:19.380 --> 14:22.060]  bunch of militia people that agreed whether it stings and then she just
[14:22.060 --> 14:28.300]  disappeared well instead of showing all the real footage in evidence she shows
[14:28.300 --> 14:34.580]  the tank they photoshop flame coming off the boom that was injecting CS gas and
[14:34.580 --> 14:39.100]  to this day when they try to debunk anybody exposing the fact that they
[14:39.100 --> 14:45.820]  murdered the people at Waco they pull up Linda Linda Thompson so it wasn't hard
[14:45.820 --> 14:50.660]  for me when I heard he was going to investigate it I said in notice he said
[14:50.660 --> 14:53.780]  oh I believe it's real but I've got to investigate and I'll tell you whether
[14:53.780 --> 14:57.580]  it's documented or not and he said oh you know I would have told you if it was
[14:57.580 --> 15:01.380]  real last night I care about you all look for the truth but it's not real it's all
[15:01.380 --> 15:04.460]  fake it's all lies the people that believe this are McVeigh's they want to
[15:04.460 --> 15:09.780]  kill you and they got a cartoon character of blood coming out of its eyes
[15:09.780 --> 15:13.620]  with steam coming out of its ears we're gonna play this later I mean this is
[15:13.620 --> 15:19.460]  what they do and it's not hard to know that got that disingenuous slime ball
[15:19.460 --> 15:24.140]  is an operative and he's got his 912 movement co-opting the Patriot movement
[15:24.140 --> 15:28.740]  co-opting everything we're doing it's not gonna work we're gonna go in to his
[15:28.740 --> 15:34.340]  groups his organizations his tea parties and the program in fact Burmese is
[15:34.340 --> 15:38.060]  gonna go down to San Antonio peacefully next week no doubt goons will try stuff
[15:38.060 --> 15:40.620]  that'll we'll have hidden cameras in the crowd that a document it just letting
[15:40.620 --> 15:44.820]  the enemy know on record what we're doing and we're gonna hand out discs to
[15:44.820 --> 15:48.660]  everybody that have all the concentration camp congressional hearings
[15:48.660 --> 15:57.460]  concentration camp documents legislation all of it and we're gonna give that to
[15:57.460 --> 16:01.500]  the people there and you should do the same thing everywhere you're at and say
[16:01.500 --> 16:05.140]  here's what Glenn Beck isn't telling you by the way we sent Glenn back all this
[16:05.140 --> 16:12.180]  information you're being given on this disc he's here to co-opt you there is no
[16:12.180 --> 16:16.020]  doubt and then he dredges up popular mechanics literally in the encyclopedia
[16:16.020 --> 16:19.740]  next to the word yellow journalism there's a picture of them i mean few
[16:19.740 --> 16:27.940]  can say that they are yet first publishing and so I'm gonna get more
[16:27.940 --> 16:32.100]  into that later in the show and they're openly announcing the global currency
[16:32.100 --> 16:35.100]  openly announcing the end of the dollar openly announcing a world
[16:35.100 --> 16:39.340]  government notice I've been distracted the last three days away from all the
[16:39.340 --> 16:43.060]  serious news I've got about open world government being announced now we've
[16:43.060 --> 16:46.740]  been proven right on that just like we've been proven right about the FEMA
[16:46.740 --> 16:52.980]  camps and everything else and meanwhile I you know we're not don't have time to
[16:52.980 --> 16:55.700]  talk about any of the serious stuff that's happening earth shattering
[16:55.700 --> 16:59.140]  because we're too busy having to fight and defend our name like I had to spend
[16:59.140 --> 17:04.260]  two days reversing the propaganda that I was saying kill Michelle Malcolm and we
[17:04.260 --> 17:07.580]  reversed it and defeated it thank God because of you the listeners we've got a
[17:07.580 --> 17:11.140]  little bit of muscle normally they can just pick on people and make stuff up
[17:11.140 --> 17:16.420]  and they can't defend themselves we can defend ourselves to a certain extent
[17:16.580 --> 17:21.740]  though there's still sites everywhere saying I said kill Michelle Malcolm and
[17:21.740 --> 17:25.100]  then they show video clearly showing I'm not saying it but you know the issue
[17:25.100 --> 17:29.220]  here is we're getting hit from too many sides it's up to you out there to realize
[17:29.220 --> 17:34.060]  how important this message is and defend us and you are doing that we thank you
[17:34.060 --> 17:38.820]  and so when it comes out and then mainstream news says Alex Jones basically
[17:38.820 --> 17:46.140]  you know programmed the cop killer because of his fear of Obama gun control
[17:46.140 --> 17:52.380]  when Obama's attorney generals on record saying ban all guns of the cowardly
[17:52.380 --> 18:00.460]  Americans basically is in the end bledded that is his words so you know I had to go
[18:00.460 --> 18:06.060]  on the offensive here the best defense is good offense and had to explain and
[18:06.060 --> 18:12.980]  show people that this guy actually attacked us and now the Pittsburgh Post

[18:45.820 --> 18:50.340]  said my letter going look this isn't true and you're saying Alex Jones is an

[25:07.300 --> 25:13.620]  have to be in this position understand it it's not just the physical danger or my
[25:13.620 --> 25:18.100]  family in danger or my name in danger in the constant attacks it's
[25:18.100 --> 25:24.700]  understanding that I know what I made up of I know I'm not perfect I know I have
[25:24.700 --> 25:30.260]  a lot of issues and I know a lot is writing on the decisions I make and
[25:30.260 --> 25:34.900]  what I do and I'm trying to be a professional I'm trying to be a good
[25:34.900 --> 25:38.540]  person I'm trying to be a loving person I'm trying to be a wise person who
[25:38.540 --> 25:43.820]  doesn't go off half cocked I've certainly gotten better over the years and
[25:43.820 --> 25:57.180]  I've got to keep my mind focused and not get distracted or diverted but we are
[25:57.180 --> 26:05.300]  beating the drum for the arrest of the bankers not just made off or Alan
[26:05.300 --> 26:10.260]  Stanford but all of these people have created Ponzi schemes these derivatives
[26:10.260 --> 26:14.180]  are illegal they are frauds the insurance companies that back them are
[26:14.180 --> 26:21.780]  engaged in frauds it's all fraud right down to the big brokerage companies and
[26:21.780 --> 26:26.300]  mortgage companies telling their brokers to just lie and certify people to have
[26:26.300 --> 26:39.740]  certain incomes they didn't have I mean this is a systemic system-wide fraud that
[26:39.740 --> 26:44.900]  runs the planet and what is hard to understand about a few thousand global
[26:44.900 --> 26:49.900]  bankers and brokerage firms getting together and creating tens of trillions
[26:49.900 --> 26:54.620]  of dollars per year in fiat made up paper and buying up the planet with it
[26:54.620 --> 27:00.420]  that's what globalism is and so we can sit here all day and talk about how we're
[27:00.420 --> 27:03.700]  gonna have armed conflict with the military and the police wrong answer
[27:03.700 --> 27:08.940]  we can sit here all day and talk about marching on Washington we can sit here
[27:08.940 --> 27:14.260]  all day and talk about waiting for the next congressional election hopefully
[27:14.260 --> 27:17.060]  they'll change something or the next presidential election you can forget all
[27:17.060 --> 27:24.980]  that what we need to do is politically with the first amendment get the what
[27:24.980 --> 27:28.460]  the evidence out to the state grand juries the federal grand juries of the
[27:28.460 --> 27:33.860]  media and force the issue that these are criminal bankers that have engaged in
[27:33.860 --> 27:37.780]  mass fraud and crimes and folks that's why I'm getting attacked right now and
[27:37.780 --> 27:41.300]  risking my life I mean you know it's when you stand at the edge of a cliff you
[27:41.300 --> 27:46.260]  get that tangle your instinct goes you're in danger buddy you know what I'm on
[27:46.260 --> 27:51.220]  the edge of the cliff leaning out over it and I've already jumped folks and I'm
[27:51.220 --> 27:55.900]  just hoping that by the time I hit the bottom we defeated the new world order
[27:55.900 --> 28:03.500]  so I get a reprieve but I'm in the air right now and a lot of you are but we
[28:03.500 --> 28:09.140]  have to make that jump we have to make that commitment against tyranny I mean
[28:09.140 --> 28:12.500]  you understand I'm talking to millions of people right now saying arrest the new
[28:12.500 --> 28:16.540]  world order and they have committed so many public crimes that we're very
[28:16.540 --> 28:19.700]  close to doing it I mean so much even mainstream media is talking about
[28:19.700 --> 28:22.820]  arresting them now Bill Moyers this weekend's talking about arresting him
[28:22.820 --> 28:26.940]  had the author on you know the best way to rob a bank is to own one former
[28:26.940 --> 28:32.740]  federal prosecutor who went after the SNL's because either the bankers get
[28:32.740 --> 28:37.020]  all the power and use the crisis they've created to have a fire sale and
[28:37.020 --> 28:43.060]  really set up world government and then use a tyranny to enforce it or we go
[28:43.060 --> 28:46.540]  wait a minute you're a bunch of petty headlers you know Hitler ran all sorts
[28:46.540 --> 28:50.940]  of financial scams and things in Germany it's the same deal Mussolini did it the
[28:50.940 --> 28:55.300]  communists do it you know this has just got to stop these are criminal bankers
[28:55.300 --> 28:58.980]  openly announcing the end of our country basically the end of our currency
[28:58.980 --> 29:05.100]  they've spent the GDP in six months twelve point eight trillion and we always
[29:05.100 --> 29:09.180]  learned that a month later so we're six months in but that's five months we
[29:09.180 --> 29:14.220]  haven't gotten the last month yet twelve point eight trillion Bloomberg AP the
[29:14.220 --> 29:20.100]  whole GDP is 13 trillions that I mean I mean listen this is insane it's so
[29:20.100 --> 29:24.580]  obvious these are criminals and they're the ones running the FBI running the ADL
[29:24.580 --> 29:30.260]  brainwashing police that constitutionalist and patriots are bad
[29:30.260 --> 29:34.140]  trying to turn us against each other so we'll blow the hell out of each other
[29:34.140 --> 29:38.860]  and fight with each other was exactly what the globalist want now folks I'm

[34:23.940 --> 34:30.260]  decade plus I have said every week on air sometimes every day I have said this
[34:30.260 --> 34:38.020]  new world order system is leading towards piles of dead police and military
[34:38.020 --> 34:42.700]  and I've told the police and military you keep following the FBI and the
[34:42.700 --> 34:46.540]  Southern Poverty Law Center in the ADL's propaganda saying gun owners or
[34:46.540 --> 34:49.580]  terrorists constitutionalist or terrorist people to talk about the
[34:49.580 --> 34:53.980]  Constitution or terrorist their cop killers they're gonna kill you that is
[34:53.980 --> 35:01.060]  gonna become a self-fulfilling prophecy when the Mayak report came out there
[35:01.060 --> 35:04.020]  all these reports coming out of you know housewives saying okay I'm locking in
[35:04.020 --> 35:07.820]  loading I guess I'm gonna be a terrorist you see it's a self-fulfilling
[35:07.820 --> 35:12.620]  prophecy you tell law abiding peaceful nice people that they're bad because they
[35:12.620 --> 35:16.940]  believe in America and freedom and liberty they're gonna now feel like the
[35:16.940 --> 35:20.380]  police are against them and become enemies of the police then you're gonna
[35:20.380 --> 35:26.860]  get the police feeling like the people of their enemies and it's a self-fulfilling
[35:26.860 --> 35:31.740]  prophecy and and as anybody knows this isn't a rumor about Obama want massive
[35:31.740 --> 35:36.220]  gun control you know Bush didn't triple triple the size of the Bureau of
[35:36.220 --> 35:39.780]  Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives built the biggest federal building in
[35:39.780 --> 35:45.500]  DC for them took four years to build it they didn't build that and triple their
[35:45.500 --> 35:50.580]  funding for nothing and he supported the assault weapons ban and they did all
[35:50.580 --> 35:53.860]  sorts of importation restrictions and things regulatory they could do outside
[35:53.860 --> 35:59.940]  the law now in comes Obama who as a state senator argued for total gun
[35:59.940 --> 36:04.620]  bans Illinois wide just come no guns for any sentences not a bolt action on a
[36:04.620 --> 36:08.780]  single shot nothing then his attorney general on behalf of the Justice
[36:08.780 --> 36:13.060]  Department before his attorney general formerly deputy attorney general writes
[36:13.060 --> 36:17.540]  letters and files a brief on behalf of the Justice Department he's such an
[36:17.540 --> 36:22.220]  anti-gun expert against the Second Amendment calling for the DC gun ban
[36:22.220 --> 36:26.460]  nationwide saying no citizen should be allowed to own any firearm only police
[36:26.460 --> 36:30.260]  military and now they've introduced a half dozen bills it's more than that
[36:30.260 --> 36:34.620]  saying ban all semi-autos I don't mean just ban their manufacturer I mean ban
[36:34.620 --> 36:40.420]  have them ban have an ammo mark all the ammo psychological federal testing to
[36:40.420 --> 36:43.420]  own a gun turning a right to a privilege the list goes on allow the
[36:43.420 --> 36:47.220]  attorney general to ban any guns he wants just give him that unlimited vice
[36:47.220 --> 36:54.780]  Roy power and so we sit here and we cover this and the news goes oh we're
[36:54.780 --> 37:04.260]  crazy conspiracy theorist and then a whacked out Marine wash up who doesn't
[37:04.260 --> 37:07.780]  even have a job but he gets two pit bulls brings them in mommy's house is doing
[37:07.780 --> 37:14.500]  his laundry and probably wiping his hind end for him and he's in there with
[37:14.500 --> 37:22.660]  his dogs urinating everywhere he said three hours sleep out drinking mom comes
[37:22.660 --> 37:26.780]  in wakes him up screams at him and says get out of here get your dogs out of
[37:26.780 --> 37:31.900]  here you're evicted he yells at her starts waving guns around she calls the
[37:31.900 --> 37:35.300]  police and says he's got guns be careful that's now in the Associated Press
[37:35.300 --> 37:41.100]  the 9-1-1 doesn't tell them they come out to the house and he kills two of them
[37:41.100 --> 37:46.420]  and then shoots another one and kills him later that came to help then wounds
[37:46.420 --> 37:51.980]  two more in a four-hour shootout now all of this is going on all of this is
[37:51.980 --> 37:59.180]  happening and what is the ADL and the Pittsburgh Post Gazette do they come out
[37:59.180 --> 38:05.300]  and they say Alex Jones influenced this guy so we call the newspapers up and we
[38:05.300 --> 38:10.780]  say how'd you do that oh we went and read his postings from his handles and I
[38:10.780 --> 38:16.340]  said really and and the one writer at the Pittsburgh Post Gazette goes yeah
[38:16.340 --> 38:20.740]  you know he he looked at your side I I'm not saying he liked you you know and
[38:20.740 --> 38:24.260]  you know nobody agrees a hundred percent I go what do you see he was the guy was
[38:24.260 --> 38:29.740]  guilty so I started searching his handles out others did and there it was
[38:29.740 --> 38:34.100]  him on my website attacking me we need to get this party started this isn't
[38:34.100 --> 38:39.060]  gonna end peacefully I disagree with Alex on and on and on and Alex is
[38:39.060 --> 38:44.900]  covering up for the Zionist and I'm a Zionist stooge all of this the opposite
[38:44.900 --> 38:50.020]  of what the ADL and the news said about me so I get attacked by a white
[38:50.020 --> 38:54.420]  supremacist and then I'm with the white supremacist you got to love that now
[38:54.420 --> 38:58.340]  that's why Pittsburgh Post Gazette's retracted in two articles that's good
[38:58.340 --> 39:03.620]  that's a good start raw story and daily cost of retracted because it is a crock
[39:03.620 --> 39:15.700]  of bull it is it is it is just a complete and total asinine fraud
[39:15.700 --> 39:22.500]  but they still tried to get their gas mileage and let me tell you what this
[39:22.500 --> 39:25.900]  attack was about I told people you know when I found out about this Saturday and
[39:25.900 --> 39:29.700]  then Sunday I called Paul Watson I called Curtin demo and I said do not do
[39:29.700 --> 39:34.380]  articles on this defending me I said let's just see if it's only the Pittsburgh
[39:34.380 --> 39:45.500]  Post Gazette in the ADL because I don't want attention off of three dead cops and
[39:45.500 --> 39:49.180]  because I understand how this works folks that would only make my show bigger
[39:49.180 --> 39:54.300]  if I was to post a big article and get the media thinking who they found a soft
[39:54.300 --> 39:58.740]  underbelly of me and that they were gonna get me and I know how this works
[39:58.740 --> 40:01.620]  that would actually have made me a lot bigger especially if I would have rolled
[40:01.620 --> 40:06.900]  over and acted like it was hurting me and and and I mean this is just like when
[40:06.900 --> 40:10.540]  you're varmint hunting you know out there with a with a whistle you know
[40:10.540 --> 40:14.140]  that blows the tune of a hurt baby rabbit I mean I'd have blown that whistle
[40:14.140 --> 40:17.820]  they'd have come right into me and I had them but I just can't do immoral stuff
[40:17.820 --> 40:22.140]  like that these people are not that smart the thing is we don't ever
[40:22.140 --> 40:27.780]  manipulate but we know how to manipulate and if I ever started trying to
[40:27.780 --> 40:33.140]  really manipulate the media it's so easy but but side issue folks I said don't
[40:33.140 --> 40:37.020]  defend me just let the attack sit out there hopefully this won't get picked
[40:37.020 --> 40:41.700]  up and get big sure enough it you know it's in the New York Times now it's
[40:41.700 --> 40:46.540]  everywhere and right as it goes into full national bloom attacking me on radio
[40:46.540 --> 40:51.420]  TV you name it that's when it comes out it's all a complete lie and they've been
[40:51.420 --> 40:59.340]  white supremacist and we're attacking me but you've got to ask yourself why did
[40:59.340 --> 41:03.260]  the southern primary law center call up that reporter and feed him that line of
[41:03.260 --> 41:08.060]  bold southern probably law center is an intelligence operation very dangerous
[41:08.060 --> 41:13.180]  organization very wicked you know they got caught running the white supremacist
[41:13.180 --> 41:17.380]  compound that hatched McVay as a federal operation that came out in FBI
[41:17.380 --> 41:20.740]  documents and believe in the FBI wasn't pleased with a federal judge ordered
[41:20.740 --> 41:29.980]  those released and it was in the AP and in the two solid city papers and they
[41:29.980 --> 41:37.780]  are not pleased so very dangerous group and you I think this was some sigh up
[41:37.780 --> 41:41.300]  and this was a setup you know the white supremacist so delusional they're
[41:41.300 --> 41:45.980]  sending me emails saying why are you covering up that Richard Popoloski is
[41:45.980 --> 41:52.940]  Jewish there's no end to these people if a meteorite came to the atmosphere and
[41:52.940 --> 41:56.900]  blew up a city they'd say Jews did it if somebody falls in a banana peel Jews
[41:56.900 --> 42:04.940]  did it you got this guy who's an obvious white supremacist and they're now
[42:04.940 --> 42:12.860]  saying he's Jewish because only a Jew could do something evil and then they're
[42:12.860 --> 42:17.540]  now saying I'm covering up that he was Jewish you gotta love it I mean you guys
[42:17.540 --> 42:23.020]  can't take responsibility for yourselves I mean Columbine was a staged event with
[42:23.020 --> 42:26.540]  the government that's documenting over the proof this thing I don't think yes
[42:26.540 --> 42:29.660]  I mean we'll tell you when something was real and when it's not in this this is
[42:29.660 --> 42:34.220]  this looks like this is a domestic disturbance he wasn't out cruising the
[42:34.220 --> 42:39.580]  streets to go kill cops like the media tried to imply he threw a fit mommy called
[42:39.580 --> 42:52.140]  the cops and he killed him so I went and looked up the family name of Popoloski
[42:52.140 --> 42:58.460]  and it means a river worker or dock worker that's how it is in Germany and
[42:58.460 --> 43:02.500]  Poland like Schwarzenegger means black plowman doesn't mean he's African
[43:02.500 --> 43:07.380]  American it means that the upper classes were in the men in the Middle Ages in the
[43:07.380 --> 43:10.620]  dark ages we're into having white skin and wearing you know hoods over
[43:10.620 --> 43:14.500]  themselves in the lower classes were very brown and dark because they worked
[43:14.500 --> 43:23.420]  in the fields so Swartz and Eger means black plowman black field worker
[43:23.420 --> 43:31.140]  Popoloski means dock worker it is an old Polish name and it's not a Jewish name
[43:31.540 --> 43:35.580]  now does that mean there aren't some Jews who may have taken the name there's
[43:35.580 --> 43:39.460]  Jews in the name Jones there's Jews with the name Smith this is ridiculous
[43:39.460 --> 43:45.660]  ladies and gentlemen and again it's this psychosis this obsession I mean you
[43:45.660 --> 43:50.340]  know my position is very clear I'm against Israel running narcotics into
[43:50.340 --> 43:53.300]  this country ecstasy and other things I'm against Israel involved in the white
[43:53.300 --> 43:56.980]  slave trade they admit they are I'm against I'm against Saudi Arabia for
[43:56.980 --> 44:03.180]  that too I am against Israel manipulating our internal politics and
[44:03.180 --> 44:06.660]  trying to start World War three with Iran when they've got the nukes and the
[44:06.660 --> 44:11.940]  missiles in the DC 10s with chemical lasers mounted on them that the whole
[44:11.940 --> 44:14.940]  length of the plane it can blow missiles out of the air all day long to make
[44:14.940 --> 44:18.700]  Patriot missile batteries look like you know tinker toys from a hundred years
[44:18.700 --> 44:25.900]  ago and so I try to reasonably criticize Germany Israel Russia the United
[44:25.900 --> 44:32.860]  States you know powerful corrupt people in high places but I'm not here to hate
[44:32.860 --> 44:38.500]  the Mexicans even though I criticize Mexico and its hate of America and the
[44:38.500 --> 44:41.660]  fact that one bankrupt for it I'm criticizing it for those reasons I don't
[44:41.660 --> 44:47.420]  hate Catholics I don't hate Jews I don't hate Hindus and it's real simple the
[44:47.420 --> 44:52.940]  establishment wants us to get into this tribalism and start making it an issue
[44:52.940 --> 44:56.780]  about Jews or about Catholics or about this or about that because in that
[44:56.780 --> 45:02.380]  narrows us down into little groups and so every time we talk about the New World
[45:02.380 --> 45:05.740]  Order openly being announced in global tyranny with the banks ruling the
[45:05.740 --> 45:15.060]  planet they go oh that's what the white supremacists say too see and so they
[45:15.060 --> 45:19.060]  can paint us with that and then keep mainline America from ever coming
[45:19.060 --> 45:25.340]  together black white doesn't matter against the New World Order and there
[45:25.340 --> 45:28.980]  are Jews in there there are Germans in there there are Chinese in there there's
[45:28.980 --> 45:32.780]  mainly British royalty in there and they're all criminals and instead of
[45:32.780 --> 45:36.220]  me look Zionist documents have been released over and over again major
[45:36.220 --> 45:39.940]  universities have written books about it how they said persecution is good we
[45:39.940 --> 45:43.420]  like Jews being persecuted because then it makes them come basically give money
[45:43.420 --> 45:46.980]  to us and then we can use them as slaves it's the same thing with the
[45:46.980 --> 45:53.260]  government staging terror attacks and saying oh give up all your rights will
[45:53.260 --> 45:57.780]  keep you safe same thing with Israel and I have just found the white
[45:57.780 --> 46:03.220]  supremacist not even suppose the white supremacist crowd just the anti
[46:03.220 --> 46:07.300]  Israel crowd which first said oh we're just anti-Zionist now it's no actually
[46:07.300 --> 46:12.660]  all Jews are the devil is what they say over and over again I found them to be
[46:12.660 --> 46:15.780]  dishonest I mean they make stuff up they lie about me they lie about everybody I
[46:15.780 --> 46:26.100]  know they fight with each other constantly and they inflate the role of
[46:26.100 --> 46:32.460]  Jews all day long or they or they twist what people say and do like I read a
[46:32.460 --> 46:35.380]  financial Times of London article about how the major stock exchanges of the
[46:35.380 --> 46:39.380]  world are owned by a couple of Arab countries and then it pointed out they
[46:39.380 --> 46:42.660]  just bought a bunch of big movie studios does that not mean that Jews
[46:42.660 --> 46:46.220]  predominantly and Italians run those studios no they still run and I was
[46:46.220 --> 46:50.820]  pointing out that a bunch of those have been bought they said oh Alex says Arabs
[46:50.820 --> 46:57.500]  run Hollywood see it's all it's all a twisting and an obsession and then they
[46:57.500 --> 47:02.620]  I mean normally they're crazy I they got zits all over their faces weird devil
[47:02.620 --> 47:06.580]  tats all over them they just can't even operate and believe me you're not gonna
[47:06.580 --> 47:09.780]  lead any successful revolution against anything I mean you know regardless of
[47:09.780 --> 47:13.820]  what you claim is at the end of the deep dark tunnel you know regardless of what
[47:13.820 --> 47:18.300]  the spider is sitting at the center of the web you're not getting anything done
[47:18.300 --> 47:21.700]  but holding back those of us that want to defeat the New World Order with all
[47:21.700 --> 47:28.940]  of your annex and you are the favorite smearing tool to tar to blacken the
[47:28.940 --> 47:33.580]  reputation of good people like Ron Paul and myself and others but the good news
[47:33.580 --> 47:37.060]  is it isn't working anymore and people are on to what's happening and they've
[47:37.060 --> 47:41.420]  caught the ADL you know running spying operations on American citizens and
[47:41.420 --> 47:45.660]  they've been convicted and they've lost in civil court for lying about people and
[47:45.660 --> 47:50.900]  and you know using anti-Semitism I mean really the ADL pimps out what's happened
[47:50.900 --> 47:53.820]  to Jews in history and some of the atrocities against Jews and what Hitler
[47:53.820 --> 47:59.940]  did that was terrible they pimp out that the the the the deaths and abuse of
[47:59.940 --> 48:05.100]  Jews and what has really happened in history they pimp it out and sell it to
[48:05.100 --> 48:08.860]  governments to then demonize groups that are against corruption oh you don't like
[48:08.860 --> 48:12.300]  government corruption you must hate Jews and then they actually make it about
[48:12.300 --> 48:17.100]  Jews the ADL and others make it and advertise that it's Jews that run the
[48:17.100 --> 48:20.620]  government it's Jews that are doing all this evil stuff and they hyped the whole
[48:20.620 --> 48:27.060]  thing up and have HBO specials and everything and movies like Barat you
[48:27.060 --> 48:31.180]  know all about Jew bashing actually you'll popularized it now where ten
[48:31.180 --> 48:33.740]  years ago I never heard Jew jokes and every source of about now that's all
[48:33.740 --> 48:43.020]  you hear it's disgusting and it's a very sophisticated psi op and I am not going
[48:43.020 --> 48:50.980]  to play along with it so nice try New York Times nice try ADL nice try others
[48:50.980 --> 48:54.700]  and now the Pittsburgh Post Gazette the original posters of this got the
[48:54.700 --> 48:59.180]  propaganda from the Southern Primary Law Center they've now retracted and said
[48:59.180 --> 49:05.740]  no actually this cop killer didn't like me and was attacking me and now a bunch
[49:05.740 --> 49:09.260]  of other publications have retracted and so are you going to retract New York
[49:09.260 --> 49:16.100]  Times are you going to retract ADL you know people think I get up here and
[49:16.100 --> 49:20.100]  threaten lawsuits threaten here threaten there folks I have sued people four
[49:20.100 --> 49:24.180]  times and it's not fun having to prepare cases spin twenty thousand dollars or
[49:24.180 --> 49:28.700]  more to go win and get a judgment and then part of the judgments are that you
[49:28.700 --> 49:35.180]  don't talk about it and it's over or people agree in court to stop saying
[49:35.180 --> 49:49.020]  things that aren't true about me but at a certain point it doesn't seem to you
[49:49.020 --> 49:56.140]  people when I say I may sue you they seem to think that's a bluff I sued two
[49:56.140 --> 49:59.780]  stalkers in one I sued the head of a radio network when somebody told him a
[49:59.780 --> 50:02.100]  lie and he repeated it and wouldn't retract it and I didn't like having to
[50:02.100 --> 50:08.140]  do that and that was a little setup we were both being manipulated I sued the
[50:08.140 --> 50:13.900]  head of access TV and found out he was stealing money and he's in Huntsville
[50:13.900 --> 50:19.740]  right now that was in the newspaper I mean I spent 20 something grand with
[50:19.740 --> 50:22.860]  private detectives and everything to do that I mean that we're you know
[50:22.860 --> 50:26.380]  recording these people and everything else I was going into meetings wearing
[50:26.380 --> 50:36.260]  wires just Google head of Austin access TV head of pack goes to prison I mean
[50:36.260 --> 50:41.020]  this is the type of stuff and I'm sitting there going hey I may sue you New
[50:41.020 --> 50:46.540]  York Times ADL or the crazy person last week put posting stories saying I
[50:46.540 --> 50:50.140]  murdered a radio talk show host I mean this crap's got a in man I'm a real

[54:39.140 --> 54:43.180]  to make this show about me but the media is gonna do that because they got to
[54:43.180 --> 54:46.580]  change the subject I mean all these years there's no world government there's
[54:46.580 --> 54:50.540]  no global currency you know they claim there's gonna be a global government
[54:50.540 --> 54:54.820]  run by international banks that will pay taxes to and then exactly that is
[54:54.820 --> 54:59.100]  announced in thousands of publications the last few months hundreds of
[54:59.100 --> 55:05.540]  articles last week all over CNN Fox MSNBC BBC specifically they define the
[55:05.540 --> 55:09.460]  new world order precisely is what we said it was because we were reading their
[55:09.460 --> 55:13.020]  their own definitions they just weren't saying it on the news they were
[55:13.020 --> 55:16.740]  writing white papers on it so of course we predicted exactly what they were
[55:16.740 --> 55:22.020]  gonna do it'd be like of a bank robber dropped out of his back pocket the
[55:22.020 --> 55:26.540]  plans to rob the bank next Friday afternoon and then the police showed up
[55:26.540 --> 55:29.580]  and knew exactly when they were gonna be there and busted them they wouldn't say
[55:29.580 --> 55:34.060]  all the police were psychic how incredible they'd say no the bank robber
[55:34.060 --> 55:38.060]  you know left his plans to rob the bank on the diner counter that's a true story
[55:38.060 --> 55:44.300]  I read about actually I mean that's all I'm doing is going oh here the bank
[55:44.300 --> 55:49.020]  robber says they're doing this and you know we've got their battle plan and
[55:49.020 --> 55:52.700]  then they robbed the bank in front of everyone imploding the world economy to
[55:52.700 --> 55:55.860]  get us under their control and then I come out and I'm talking about it having
[55:55.860 --> 55:58.580]  all these other guests on talking about it trying to work with everybody and be
[55:58.580 --> 56:02.660]  friendly and nice and get free humanity to come together and here comes the
[56:02.660 --> 56:07.180]  government going no those that talk about banks or white supremacist and the
[56:07.180 --> 56:14.460]  white supremacist go yeah it is Jews which is exactly what the media wants and
[56:14.460 --> 56:18.540]  is exactly what they're doing because everybody's been preconditioned over the
[56:18.540 --> 56:23.140]  run from that and so you're helping the new world order I hope you're proud of
[56:23.140 --> 56:29.420]  yourself I really hope you're proud of yourselves and I know you are because
[56:29.420 --> 56:33.340]  you're led by feds I remember in Miami Herald a few months ago reporting that
[56:33.340 --> 56:41.380]  the white supremacist commanders of the major rallies were FBI well of course
[56:41.380 --> 56:46.620]  they don't infiltrate the groups they run the groups and that's how they know
[56:46.620 --> 56:50.380]  it's always the same some 18 22 year old with tattoos all over them with a
[56:50.380 --> 56:53.940]  machine gun all hyped up on a warrior trip should have just joined the
[56:53.940 --> 56:59.460]  military and you know where we're gonna go after Obama and where white tuxedos
[56:59.460 --> 57:06.180]  white top hats that we drive an armored Hummer with a sunroof and we take over
[57:06.180 --> 57:10.980]  the White House you just made up a man they're always delusional people that
[57:10.980 --> 57:14.580]  the feds then set up and go oh my god we've got a restrict free speech and
[57:14.580 --> 57:18.540]  take people's guns because there's there's racist everywhere that believe in a
[57:18.540 --> 57:23.780]  new world order and you guys play right into it I mean maybe you like being
[57:23.780 --> 57:31.460]  suckers maybe you like being conned maybe you like being absolute idiots

[1:08:41.420 --> 1:08:45.860]  his name is Mike Rivera joining us from Hawaii to get his perspective on things
[1:08:45.860 --> 1:08:50.140]  that are happening now in the last hour of ranting and raving I didn't even get
[1:08:50.140 --> 1:08:56.540]  into this report last Thursday Kurt Nemo wrote a story about a legal
[1:08:56.540 --> 1:08:59.900]  checkpoint that was mentioned in the news where they were going to have a
[1:08:59.900 --> 1:09:03.700]  regular army and this was statewide by the way we've now discovered running
[1:09:03.700 --> 1:09:09.140]  checkpoints searching people's cars just randomly on the highway and then local
[1:09:09.140 --> 1:09:15.820]  news is now reported they went ahead and did it in one town with that we learned
[1:09:15.820 --> 1:09:19.540]  that we wrote a story about regular army to run a checkpoint our listeners
[1:09:19.540 --> 1:09:23.220]  because of WBCR and a few other affiliates we have in Tennessee great
[1:09:23.220 --> 1:09:28.620]  folks out there they called the governor and the governor canceled and we had
[1:09:28.620 --> 1:09:35.380]  state representative on the show Johnny Shaw what from district 80 yesterday
[1:09:35.380 --> 1:09:38.980]  talking about how it was upsetting people then we learned that they went ahead
[1:09:38.980 --> 1:09:43.220]  and did the drill with Air Force MPs you name it and other cities and towns and
[1:09:43.220 --> 1:09:51.380]  the Marion County News reported that the traffic was backed up for a mile as the
[1:09:51.380 --> 1:09:57.700]  U.S. Air Force troops homeland security Bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms
[1:09:57.700 --> 1:10:04.140]  National Guard local police just just it goes on and on Tennessee Department
[1:10:04.140 --> 1:10:08.020]  Transportation Tennessee Department of Revenue and they didn't find any terrorists
[1:10:08.020 --> 1:10:11.380]  they said they were looking for 24-style terrorists but they did write some DWI's
[1:10:11.380 --> 1:10:16.620]  and write tickets and you know for dust on the bumper of a truck an 18-wheeler so
[1:10:16.620 --> 1:10:20.260]  they did raise a bunch of money just swarms of every agency and they're
[1:10:20.260 --> 1:10:26.420]  feeding at the trough as the country collapses and so I wanted to I wanted to
[1:10:26.420 --> 1:10:28.540]  first we're going to play that clip coming up on first one to talk to
[1:10:28.540 --> 1:10:33.420]  micro vero about that because you know we've had the mainstream media Mike
[1:10:33.420 --> 1:10:38.620]  attacking us saying that there's no plan to put troops on the streets as it's in
[1:10:38.620 --> 1:10:42.380]  the Army times and the Washington Post they say all that's a conspiracy
[1:10:42.380 --> 1:10:45.940]  Glenbeck says there's no plan to put troops on the streets but then
[1:10:45.940 --> 1:10:50.740]  meanwhile they're just doing it everywhere yeah we're seeing this all
[1:10:50.740 --> 1:10:54.740]  over the country and it's it's a big problem it's incrementalism they're
[1:10:54.740 --> 1:10:59.100]  trying slowly but surely to get ordinary American citizens used to the idea of
[1:10:59.100 --> 1:11:03.580]  military people in the streets at all time and yet it is a violation of Posse
[1:11:03.580 --> 1:11:07.500]  Kamatata's and it's like the old saying about once the camel gets that nose
[1:11:07.500 --> 1:11:10.980]  under the edge of the tent the camel is coming in and that's what they're trying
[1:11:10.980 --> 1:11:14.700]  to do they're trying to get everybody used to the idea of literally an America
[1:11:14.700 --> 1:11:18.980]  under u.s. military occupation exactly the same thing they're doing in Iraq
[1:11:18.980 --> 1:11:22.540]  exactly the same thing they're doing in Afghanistan exactly the same thing
[1:11:22.540 --> 1:11:27.020]  they're trying to do in Iran and if you think about it checkpoints with armed
[1:11:27.020 --> 1:11:30.820]  military people and traffic jams a mile back that's the kind of things we see
[1:11:30.820 --> 1:11:36.820]  being done in Gaza all the time and the Americans should be very concerned and
[1:11:36.820 --> 1:11:41.020]  very angry about this because we're all being treated like criminals why we're
[1:11:41.020 --> 1:11:44.620]  not the criminals here we are not criminals and we should refuse to be
[1:11:44.620 --> 1:11:48.620]  treated like criminals the whole point of the bill of rights is that the
[1:11:48.620 --> 1:11:53.340]  government is not allowed to treat law abiding citizens as anything other than
[1:11:53.340 --> 1:11:57.060]  law abiding citizens are not allowed to come into our homes in our cars just to
[1:11:57.060 --> 1:12:01.700]  look around at random on the off chance they might see something well I mean this
[1:12:01.700 --> 1:12:04.820]  is classical tyranny to have troops on the streets searching you in the middle
[1:12:04.820 --> 1:12:08.620]  of the country you know they claimed 9-11 was about al-qaeda and it was just
[1:12:08.620 --> 1:12:14.660]  for them losing their rights whoever al-qaeda was lcaida now they're coming
[1:12:14.660 --> 1:12:19.340]  out and saying oh no it's it's it's Americans the army's here to fight crime
[1:12:19.340 --> 1:12:24.900]  and you don't get new process and we're preparing to engage you and take over the
[1:12:24.900 --> 1:12:27.860]  states and meanwhile they've got the military and all the public schools now
[1:12:27.860 --> 1:12:32.900]  recruiting by federal law they're converting hundreds and hundreds of
[1:12:32.900 --> 1:12:37.420]  public schools to military academies they've got the BATF in the seventh and
[1:12:37.420 --> 1:12:42.340]  eighth grade with a semester courses what's in mommy and daddy's medicine
[1:12:42.340 --> 1:12:46.420]  cabinet I mean I have local news ads the police run saying title on your parents
[1:12:46.420 --> 1:12:51.420]  we give you 200 bucks I mean this is stasi and then suddenly all the armies
[1:12:51.420 --> 1:12:54.980]  here the air forces here all there's fiesta and san Antonio we're gonna have
[1:12:54.980 --> 1:12:59.980]  the MPs out from the army base and the air force base searching you and they're
[1:12:59.980 --> 1:13:04.820]  just doing it doing it doing it doing it doing it clearly because the bankers
[1:13:04.820 --> 1:13:07.980]  are looting and robbing and stealing everything and they're afraid of us ever
[1:13:07.980 --> 1:13:11.100]  getting control of our government again legally and lawfully and bringing them
[1:13:11.100 --> 1:13:16.900]  to justice that's exactly right what this is about is political repression they
[1:13:16.900 --> 1:13:20.620]  know that they have lost the ability to lie to the American people and get away
[1:13:20.620 --> 1:13:25.740]  with it so now it's just deteriorating into absolute thugism when capitalism
[1:13:25.740 --> 1:13:29.740]  fails it becomes fascist and that's exactly where we are right now
[1:13:29.740 --> 1:13:32.740]  they're trying to loot the country it's not going to go on much longer I don't
[1:13:32.740 --> 1:13:35.820]  think they can hold it together much longer but while they're continuing to
[1:13:35.820 --> 1:13:38.980]  loot the country they're going to have the armed guards making sure that we
[1:13:38.980 --> 1:13:42.700]  don't stand up and say look that's our money please take your hands off of it
[1:13:42.700 --> 1:13:46.820]  in fact give it back to us and they're looking at what's happening in european
[1:13:46.820 --> 1:13:51.780]  places like iceland and Czechoslovakia or the Czech Republic rather they're
[1:13:51.780 --> 1:13:55.260]  obviously very concerned that we're going to start seeing mass riots here is the
[1:13:55.260 --> 1:13:59.180]  economy continues to deteriorate and we the American people are going to start
[1:13:59.180 --> 1:14:02.900]  saying it is time to get rid of this corrupt government and get something
[1:14:02.900 --> 1:14:07.100]  better that works for the people in its place it already happened in iceland
[1:14:07.100 --> 1:14:11.420]  it's happening in other countries around the world this is a global revolt or a
[1:14:11.420 --> 1:14:16.140]  global reboot if you will where everybody is saying this style of
[1:14:16.140 --> 1:14:20.780]  capitalism the style of banking is great for the rich it is terrible for
[1:14:20.780 --> 1:14:25.020]  ordinary people and it is time to change the system again to something that works
[1:14:25.020 --> 1:14:28.900]  for us and that's what they're afraid of and they're going to stand there with
[1:14:28.900 --> 1:14:32.740]  their guns guarding their treasure houses and just grab on to as much as they
[1:14:32.740 --> 1:14:38.740]  can before they get kicked out exactly bloomberg financial every few months new
[1:14:38.740 --> 1:14:42.420]  numbers come out we always sit with horror waiting two weeks after the bailout
[1:14:42.420 --> 1:14:46.140]  it was two point two trillion a couple months later it was five and a half
[1:14:46.140 --> 1:14:50.020]  trillion then it was eight point seven then nine point eight and then now the
[1:14:50.020 --> 1:14:55.620]  newest numbers come out twelve trillion eight hundred billion just shy of the
[1:14:55.620 --> 1:15:02.540]  entire gdp in six months i mean the this makes why more republics stuff look
[1:15:02.540 --> 1:15:06.660]  tame this makes them bob way look tame i mean that folks for those who don't know
[1:15:06.660 --> 1:15:10.860]  they've never had spending anywhere near this this this this and they're
[1:15:10.860 --> 1:15:15.900]  claiming we owe all this in tax money that was given to offshore banks and then
[1:15:15.900 --> 1:15:19.460]  meanwhile they're got army checkpoints popping up everywhere i mean this is
[1:15:19.460 --> 1:15:25.100]  highway robbery it's worse than that it's slavery because when they hand a
[1:15:25.100 --> 1:15:29.660]  bill to every american for forty fifty thousand dollars and then have armed
[1:15:29.660 --> 1:15:33.260]  guards pointed at you to make sure that you're going to pay it off with you know
[1:15:33.260 --> 1:15:37.100]  you don't have a choice in anymore that really is slavery and one of the things
[1:15:37.100 --> 1:15:40.580]  we say around our website all the time is there is no freedom without the freedom
[1:15:40.580 --> 1:15:45.540]  to say no we're always being told we're so free the terrorist hate us but if we
[1:15:45.540 --> 1:15:50.540]  can't say no then we are not free we are slaves six months ago when tarp was
[1:15:50.540 --> 1:15:54.220]  first being ramrod through the congress ninety percent of all phone calls to the
[1:15:54.220 --> 1:16:00.340]  congress from american said no no way do not use our money to fix a broken
[1:16:00.340 --> 1:16:04.980]  corporation congress did it anyway even right before an election which shows you
[1:16:04.980 --> 1:16:08.460]  how much force was being brought to bear as you keep saying the numbers keep
[1:16:08.460 --> 1:16:12.980]  going up and going up and going up all americans working class and and middle
[1:16:12.980 --> 1:16:17.380]  class americans are saying please don't do this you are selling our future to the
[1:16:17.380 --> 1:16:21.620]  bankers and financial institutions to the bernie made off of the world they
[1:16:21.620 --> 1:16:25.580]  just nailed another one of his feeders for fraud they're all crooks and our
[1:16:25.580 --> 1:16:30.140]  government is working hand-in-hand with them to loot the populace and just give
[1:16:30.140 --> 1:16:32.940]  it to the people who've already got so much money they can't remember how many
[1:16:32.940 --> 1:16:38.300]  homes they own and we the people seem at this point unable to say no and that
[1:16:38.300 --> 1:16:43.820]  means we are slaves yeah it's what in the times of london with the former head
[1:16:43.820 --> 1:16:50.460]  of gm a c in fact i guess google google bernard made off and hit news because i
[1:16:50.460 --> 1:16:54.020]  thought i printed this morning i don't have it feeding billions
[1:16:54.020 --> 1:16:56.060]  uh... into made off
[1:16:56.060 --> 1:17:00.100]  uh... so so they've got uh... all sorts of scams going on
[1:17:00.100 --> 1:17:03.500]  they're now saying that alan stanford with the ten billion bucks stolen
[1:17:03.500 --> 1:17:06.300]  uh... sir alan stanford by the queen running
[1:17:06.300 --> 1:17:10.020]  was involved in money laundering for cocaine dealers will of course
[1:17:10.020 --> 1:17:13.460]  i mean who do you think these people are
[1:17:13.460 --> 1:17:17.580]  yeah it's it's it's it's out of control and the the more we dig
[1:17:17.580 --> 1:17:21.780]  where we're starting to see it is just this incredible interconnected network
[1:17:21.780 --> 1:17:26.740]  of fraudsters and scamsters and right now there's a huge huge rush i think one
[1:17:26.740 --> 1:17:30.540]  of the reasons why barack obama is trying so hard to get a new war going
[1:17:30.540 --> 1:17:36.220]  in iran or north korea or it almost doesn't really matter is as more and
[1:17:36.220 --> 1:17:40.180]  more of this financial corruption comes to light especially here at tax time
[1:17:40.180 --> 1:17:42.080]  where so many americans are just
[1:17:42.080 --> 1:17:44.340]  angry over the whole tax system
[1:17:44.340 --> 1:17:47.260]  uh... we're starting to ask those questions we should have been asking
[1:17:47.260 --> 1:17:51.980]  all along is this really a legitimate government should i go on supporting it
[1:17:51.980 --> 1:17:54.940]  and more and more people are saying no it's just a bunch of crooks
[1:17:54.940 --> 1:17:58.140]  they're serving their own interests they're selling our future to the
[1:17:58.140 --> 1:18:00.300]  bankers to the federal reserve
[1:18:00.300 --> 1:18:02.220]  why should i go on supporting that
[1:18:02.220 --> 1:18:05.820]  and i think we're we're getting near to the sort of flashpoint we saw in romania
[1:18:05.820 --> 1:18:06.940]  some years back
[1:18:06.940 --> 1:18:09.300]  where it's just all going to explode
[1:18:09.300 --> 1:18:12.780]  barack wants a war that he can blame all of these problems on and if he doesn't
[1:18:12.780 --> 1:18:14.100]  get it
[1:18:14.100 --> 1:18:16.660]  the writing is on the wall the american people are reaching the point where
[1:18:16.660 --> 1:18:17.860]  they're gonna stand up and say
[1:18:17.860 --> 1:18:21.460]  no we have a right to say no we are saying no
[1:18:21.460 --> 1:18:24.820]  and that's what the rand corporation said six months ago they said we need a
[1:18:24.820 --> 1:18:27.940]  war bigger than iraq a world war three
[1:18:27.940 --> 1:18:30.780]  so the public will rally around the government
[1:18:30.780 --> 1:18:34.060]  uh... through false patriotism so we can continue the looting
[1:18:34.060 --> 1:18:37.940]  and so they're now israel saying we may go ahead and strike iran we're gonna go
[1:18:37.940 --> 1:18:39.180]  ahead and attack them
[1:18:39.180 --> 1:18:43.020]  and then all hell's gonna break loose with that or they may just invade
[1:18:43.020 --> 1:18:45.380]  pakistan i'm just watching the news this morning
[1:18:45.380 --> 1:18:47.940]  they're going to love on getting ready to hit the white house tell about the
[1:18:47.940 --> 1:18:49.460]  greatest strike america
[1:18:49.460 --> 1:18:51.580]  you can see him stage the terror attack
[1:18:51.580 --> 1:18:53.020]  claim pakistan did it
[1:18:53.020 --> 1:18:55.660]  and we're off to the races there with a nuclear power
[1:18:55.660 --> 1:18:59.540]  and then all well yeah the banks are looting me of trillions a month but i
[1:18:59.540 --> 1:19:04.980]  guess it's okay because i'm fighting brown people in a country i can't find
[1:19:04.980 --> 1:19:09.180]  well i think where the rand corporation has missed it in fact so many of these
[1:19:09.180 --> 1:19:13.660]  old cold war fossils continue to make this mistake they don't understand how
[1:19:13.660 --> 1:19:17.540]  the alternative media how websites like prison planet info wars and what really
[1:19:17.540 --> 1:19:18.260]  happened
[1:19:18.260 --> 1:19:20.820]  have changed the fundamental nature
[1:19:20.820 --> 1:19:24.980]  of the way information flows for society they may start a war assuming the
[1:19:24.980 --> 1:19:27.420]  american people are going to rally around the flag
[1:19:27.420 --> 1:19:31.180]  out of false patriotism but that's not going to work if the american people
[1:19:31.180 --> 1:19:37.340]  already know that is the only reason for the war to exist
[1:19:37.340 --> 1:19:40.780]  well you're absolutely right i'd wanna
[1:19:40.780 --> 1:19:42.500]  walk through
[1:19:42.500 --> 1:19:46.020]  how you see the sun folding and this is the most critical time in history we're
[1:19:46.020 --> 1:19:47.580]  entering right now we've been in it

[1:24:33.180 --> 1:24:36.700]  coming up uh i'm going to play a little clip of lou doves with the
[1:24:36.700 --> 1:24:41.340]  mexican president calderon saying u.s officials are helping deal the drugs in
[1:24:41.340 --> 1:24:45.580]  the u.s and lou dobs says i can't disagree with you i've studied this and i agree
[1:24:45.580 --> 1:24:49.820]  of course the cia select general admitted in 96 congressional hearings at the
[1:24:49.820 --> 1:24:52.380]  government shipping in the majority of the narcotics
[1:24:52.380 --> 1:24:55.980]  uh so just of the phony drug war is falling apart everything starting
[1:24:55.980 --> 1:24:59.820]  to implode inside uh this system
[1:24:59.820 --> 1:25:03.100]  microbarrow specifically on the internet front
[1:25:03.100 --> 1:25:06.460]  cyber security bill gives obama dictatorial power over the internet
[1:25:06.460 --> 1:25:10.540]  even mother jones admits with the headline should obama control the
[1:25:10.540 --> 1:25:14.220]  internet that this is a takeover they're taking over the infrastructure
[1:25:14.220 --> 1:25:18.700]  uh the very hubs of the companies show that the government literally we can
[1:25:18.700 --> 1:25:21.820]  shut it down or tap it without warrants and that's admitted
[1:25:21.820 --> 1:25:24.940]  and as you know three weeks ago the head of cyber security for homeland security
[1:25:24.940 --> 1:25:28.060]  over to quit saying this is a threat to our free country
[1:25:28.060 --> 1:25:31.580]  our threat to democracy uh and our republic
[1:25:31.580 --> 1:25:35.580]  in his words uh by doing this so there's your inside whistleblower
[1:25:35.580 --> 1:25:38.780]  that this is a total takeover in the new york times coming out saying
[1:25:38.780 --> 1:25:42.700]  we need to gatekeep the internet we need to control free speech because the
[1:25:42.700 --> 1:25:47.020]  mainstream media can't compete with us no they absolutely cannot mostly because
[1:25:47.020 --> 1:25:49.740]  we've caught the mainstream and well actually i call them the corporate
[1:25:49.740 --> 1:25:52.860]  media because the mainstream is shifting to us
[1:25:52.860 --> 1:25:56.620]  the alternative media the blogosphere we're already outpacing
[1:25:56.620 --> 1:26:01.340]  uh traditional paper newspapers where we're neck and neck with the large
[1:26:01.340 --> 1:26:04.780]  uh radio networks like clear channel we're catching up on tv
[1:26:04.780 --> 1:26:08.540]  and the bottom line is this is a threat to the monopoly of information by the
[1:26:08.540 --> 1:26:12.140]  government and by the corporate media they can't lie to us anymore
[1:26:12.140 --> 1:26:16.220]  and if they can't lie to us they can't control us and unfortunately
[1:26:16.220 --> 1:26:20.620]  our government is carrying so many lies forward accumulated over the last 200
[1:26:20.620 --> 1:26:23.180]  years they can't start telling the truth now
[1:26:23.180 --> 1:26:26.140]  or they they're going to face some very embarrassing questions
[1:26:26.140 --> 1:26:30.620]  and so they're kind of trapped by the uh the fossilization of their mendacity if
[1:26:30.620 --> 1:26:34.460]  you want a phrase for that and so yeah they see the internet as a threat
[1:26:34.460 --> 1:26:37.900]  and they're trying to find ways to control it they plant all kinds of public
[1:26:37.900 --> 1:26:41.420]  relations people on there uh to try and shout down
[1:26:41.420 --> 1:26:46.380]  uh dissenting points of view they certainly monitor all of our websites and
[1:26:46.380 --> 1:26:49.100]  watch out for what we're saying and keep tabs on that
[1:26:49.100 --> 1:26:53.500]  they fund and set up their own competing websites to try as your song for the
[1:26:53.500 --> 1:26:56.940]  bumper was saying to try and keep us squabbling amongst ourselves
[1:26:56.940 --> 1:27:00.620]  instead of uniting and realizing that the biggest problem with the united states
[1:27:00.620 --> 1:27:04.540]  is the united states government and so yeah they're going to try and control
[1:27:04.540 --> 1:27:07.900]  they're going to try and shut it down i don't think they can succeed
[1:27:07.900 --> 1:27:11.500]  anymore than the people who wanted to shut down guttenberg's movable type
[1:27:11.500 --> 1:27:15.020]  printing and inexpensive books were able to succeed
[1:27:15.020 --> 1:27:19.500]  with that uh we we already know that there is a networking system out there
[1:27:19.500 --> 1:27:22.860]  called phytonet that operates without the big
[1:27:22.860 --> 1:27:27.580]  corporate uh fiber companies uh it's a little slower than the traditional
[1:27:27.580 --> 1:27:32.140]  internet but it does work and it can operate without being a subject to
[1:27:32.140 --> 1:27:36.860]  government censorship or control because there is no physical infrastructure
[1:27:36.860 --> 1:27:39.660]  it's all telephone to telephone to telephone and remember
[1:27:39.660 --> 1:27:43.420]  in the former soviet union that corrupt government was brought down
[1:27:43.420 --> 1:27:48.060]  by a network of fax machines that's all the russian people had to spread the
[1:27:48.060 --> 1:27:51.100]  truth with and that's what they use people want the truth
[1:27:51.100 --> 1:27:54.460]  they're going to go where the truth is to be found if they find some way to
[1:27:54.460 --> 1:27:58.300]  shut down and turn the internet uh into just a glorified
[1:27:58.300 --> 1:28:02.220]  new tv network the people who want the truth are going to find a way
[1:28:02.220 --> 1:28:06.620]  to get to it there'll always be a new alternative means of mass communication
[1:28:06.620 --> 1:28:10.620]  because now we know it is possible to accomplish
[1:28:10.620 --> 1:28:15.660]  exactly as they tax the web shut it down we make it a few thousand channels as
[1:28:15.660 --> 1:28:19.340]  china's already done as australia has announced you know
[1:28:19.340 --> 1:28:23.660]  chinese style net censorship for australia and they say that's good
[1:28:23.660 --> 1:28:27.020]  they're not trying it with ending net neutrality internet too
[1:28:27.020 --> 1:28:31.260]  uh all all of these systems and now having the federal government
[1:28:31.260 --> 1:28:36.220]  make companies bring in federal hubs to literally snoop and watch everything
[1:28:36.220 --> 1:28:40.380]  with no warrants i mean obama said he was gonna you know in bush's warrant was
[1:28:40.380 --> 1:28:45.420]  wiretapping he's going further uh than uh bush did
[1:28:45.420 --> 1:28:49.980]  yes he absolutely is there was a story we ran earlier today basically saying
[1:28:49.980 --> 1:28:53.980]  that obama is expanding bush's legal
[1:28:53.980 --> 1:28:57.740]  justification for warrantless snooping on all of our communications
[1:28:57.740 --> 1:29:02.140]  and folks here's the bottom line under this guys that our government is trying
[1:29:02.140 --> 1:29:05.100]  to find and and and deal with terrorists
[1:29:05.100 --> 1:29:07.820]  they are treating us like we are the criminals
[1:29:07.820 --> 1:29:11.260]  every time we go through an airport every time we do may send an email
[1:29:11.260 --> 1:29:15.740]  every time we make a phone call we are being treated as if we are the prisoners
[1:29:15.740 --> 1:29:19.500]  that they are so terrified of us they're trying to find some way
[1:29:19.500 --> 1:29:22.060]  they can stop us from communicating with each other
[1:29:22.060 --> 1:29:25.820]  that's the reason for the police roadblocks keep us so scared we
[1:29:25.820 --> 1:29:28.780]  will we won't talk to each other stay there stay there repeat that when we
[1:29:28.780 --> 1:29:32.540]  come back that's key oh why is the army at the checkpoint

[1:33:16.780 --> 1:33:21.260]  purchase the high quality dvd of the obama deception i had a copy or
[1:33:21.260 --> 1:33:25.980]  somewhere i was a show folks on tv it doesn't matter
[1:33:25.980 --> 1:33:31.020]  the point is is that this film shows you who runs the planet
[1:33:31.020 --> 1:33:35.740]  how what the bankers are doing how they want a world government
[1:33:35.740 --> 1:33:38.780]  to take their ponzi scheme scam buy up the planet
[1:33:38.780 --> 1:33:43.260]  then set up a giant global carbon tax to regulate and control every facet of our
[1:33:43.260 --> 1:33:46.140]  lives i mean this is the only issue is what
[1:33:46.140 --> 1:33:51.180]  these bankers are doing and what's taking place with them
[1:33:51.180 --> 1:33:55.740]  that's the big issue not britney spears and her new ipod or
[1:33:55.740 --> 1:33:59.340]  obama giving the queen an ipod
[1:33:59.340 --> 1:34:07.820]  or you know what obama's the first lady's wearing today
[1:34:07.820 --> 1:34:14.300]  the bankers have stolen the entire gdp of the nation in six months
[1:34:14.300 --> 1:34:18.140]  as much as the country produces in a year
[1:34:18.140 --> 1:34:22.620]  they've stolen in half a year and they're only intensifying the stealing
[1:34:22.620 --> 1:34:26.780]  and they're going to try to squeeze it out of you
[1:34:26.780 --> 1:34:30.140]  and they've got about a third of the population
[1:34:30.140 --> 1:34:32.940]  because remember he only got a little bit more than half of the voters and that
[1:34:32.940 --> 1:34:36.060]  was 60 so he's got about a third of the population
[1:34:36.060 --> 1:34:39.500]  believing anything he says anything he does
[1:34:39.500 --> 1:34:42.860]  we got to reach out to those folks fast because that's the cannon fodder the

[1:35:02.300 --> 1:35:06.700]  okay going back to micro vera mike getting into made-off
[1:35:06.700 --> 1:35:10.860]  i mean i keep harping on this because what the banks have done with this
[1:35:10.860 --> 1:35:14.140]  ponzi scheme with this counterfeit money
[1:35:14.140 --> 1:35:18.140]  which even bill moyer's is having guessed on you know saying it's a fraud
[1:35:18.140 --> 1:35:22.540]  it's a takeover it's a bank robbery mainstream news is now admitting that
[1:35:22.540 --> 1:35:25.820]  we have to instead of just going through this endless political pop
[1:35:25.820 --> 1:35:30.860]  system where they keep replacing it with the two parties that they own
[1:35:30.860 --> 1:35:34.220]  don't we need to go for their indictment by grand juries and then
[1:35:34.220 --> 1:35:39.420]  investigations and go up the chain uh... from made-off
[1:35:39.420 --> 1:35:42.620]  uh... and others that are involved in all of this corruption
[1:35:42.620 --> 1:35:46.540]  right up to the top and then go ahead and just arrest the new order bankers
[1:35:46.540 --> 1:35:50.540]  uh... instead of having them take over the planet and feed the entire economy
[1:35:50.540 --> 1:35:55.020]  into their coffers well that would be the ideal obviously but we're already
[1:35:55.020 --> 1:35:57.740]  seeing a tremendous amount of reluctance to uh...
[1:35:57.740 --> 1:36:01.820]  it investigate let alone prosecute made-off in his circle of particulars
[1:36:01.820 --> 1:36:05.420]  and to give you an example i mean look at the a pack spy trial
[1:36:05.420 --> 1:36:08.860]  i mean how many years that has been delayed and that has been delayed
[1:36:08.860 --> 1:36:12.460]  there are some secrets at the core of the u.s government
[1:36:12.460 --> 1:36:18.140]  that if they were exposed would trigger a revolt within twenty four hours and
[1:36:18.140 --> 1:36:21.820]  they're trying to protect those and anybody who's connected to those
[1:36:21.820 --> 1:36:24.540]  secrets anybody who's got that inside information
[1:36:24.540 --> 1:36:29.020]  they become the untouchables nothing can be allowed to happen to them
[1:36:29.020 --> 1:36:33.900]  and so as a result uh... you you have to get into this situation
[1:36:33.900 --> 1:36:38.220]  where they wind up being protected and uh... we're not going to see legal
[1:36:38.220 --> 1:36:41.260]  action we're not going to see you know they'll be a call for a special
[1:36:41.260 --> 1:36:45.820]  prosecutor they'll be a call for uh... a new investigation
[1:36:45.820 --> 1:36:49.020]  which will go absolutely no place and we're already seeing where they're
[1:36:49.020 --> 1:36:52.700]  talking about they don't want to do the claw backs on bernie made-offs
[1:36:52.700 --> 1:36:55.420]  uh... pyramid scheme because they don't
[1:36:55.420 --> 1:37:00.140]  no uh... they they don't want exposed to made the money off of that because we're
[1:37:00.140 --> 1:37:02.460]  talking about sixty five billion dollars in losses
[1:37:02.460 --> 1:37:06.300]  what they're not talking about is all the people who made money
[1:37:06.300 --> 1:37:10.060]  and where that money went we know that some of that money
[1:37:10.060 --> 1:37:14.140]  went to uh... certain pro-israel foundations and organizations
[1:37:14.140 --> 1:37:17.020]  which then funneled that money through a pack
[1:37:17.020 --> 1:37:21.020]  to the campaign war chest of congressman who are pro-israel
[1:37:21.020 --> 1:37:25.580]  so bernie made off at the very least is known to be part of the funding mechanism
[1:37:25.580 --> 1:37:29.740]  by which a pack bought the u.s congress away from the american people
[1:37:29.740 --> 1:37:33.020]  so where i don't think we're going to be able to see
[1:37:33.020 --> 1:37:37.020]  much luck in going after indictments and grand juries i mean
[1:37:37.020 --> 1:37:40.540]  you know we're letting the people who committed torture walk free spain is
[1:37:40.540 --> 1:37:43.340]  going to indict and try them in absentia
[1:37:43.340 --> 1:37:47.180]  but our own governmental system is protecting its own
[1:37:47.180 --> 1:37:50.860]  and that is why ultimately i think the ultimate outcome of our current
[1:37:50.860 --> 1:37:55.420]  historical period is we're going to see the u.s government collapse the way the
[1:37:55.420 --> 1:37:59.020]  old ussr did sooner would be better than later
[1:37:59.020 --> 1:38:02.300]  uh... and and the the players are just going to line their own pockets as much
[1:38:02.300 --> 1:38:05.820]  as they can between now and when they have to head for the border
[1:38:05.820 --> 1:38:09.020]  well we're already seeing a lot of elites in the last five years leave the
[1:38:09.020 --> 1:38:12.300]  united states and they're leaving israel they're even leaving england
[1:38:12.300 --> 1:38:15.260]  they're moving to cook islands australia new zealand
[1:38:15.260 --> 1:38:21.500]  perigway so we see the elite actually exiting uh... western nations
[1:38:21.500 --> 1:38:24.700]  now that i think they understand the writing is on the wall and
[1:38:24.700 --> 1:38:28.060]  as we keep saying the last official act of any government is to loot the nation
[1:38:28.060 --> 1:38:32.380]  and that seems to be going on right now uh... certainly my opinion of barack
[1:38:32.380 --> 1:38:35.980]  obama is that he does not appear to be doing anything at all
[1:38:35.980 --> 1:38:40.380]  consistent with the idea that the u.s economy can be saved in the long term
[1:38:40.380 --> 1:38:44.300]  everything right now is just grab the money and give it to this favorite crony
[1:38:44.300 --> 1:38:47.660]  and grab more money and give it to that favorite supporter and
[1:38:47.660 --> 1:38:50.940]  he's not doing any of the things that would be consistent
[1:38:50.940 --> 1:38:55.420]  with restarting the u.s economy and getting a lot like to be specific you
[1:38:55.420 --> 1:38:57.740]  are a barack obama supporter
[1:38:57.740 --> 1:39:01.580]  uh... now he's been office a couple months uh... what's your take on him
[1:39:01.580 --> 1:39:02.540]  now
[1:39:02.540 --> 1:39:06.700]  well the honeymoon is definitely over and uh... the condom wrappers are on the
[1:39:06.700 --> 1:39:08.380]  floor and we got
[1:39:08.380 --> 1:39:09.900]  you know
[1:39:09.900 --> 1:39:16.460]  i was favoring barack obama marginally over john mccain i really wanted ron paul
[1:39:16.460 --> 1:39:20.460]  as so many americans did but when it became obvious that ron paul was simply
[1:39:20.460 --> 1:39:23.420]  not going to be allowed to get near the convention floors
[1:39:23.420 --> 1:39:27.660]  uh... and we we came down to that awful choice of the lesser of two evils and i
[1:39:27.660 --> 1:39:30.460]  still don't know that john mccain would have been any better
[1:39:30.460 --> 1:39:34.460]  at this it does seem that they're both owned by the same interests
[1:39:34.460 --> 1:39:37.420]  and uh... really the difference between republican and democrat
[1:39:37.420 --> 1:39:39.740]  appears to be almost purely cosmetic
[1:39:39.740 --> 1:39:42.620]  uh... and it's almost irrelevant who's in the white house right now they're all
[1:39:42.620 --> 1:39:43.340]  pushing
[1:39:43.340 --> 1:39:46.140]  the same agenda this globalism
[1:39:46.140 --> 1:39:49.980]  uh... this one world government and i gotta tell you every time i hear global
[1:39:49.980 --> 1:39:53.740]  governance or new world order or one world government i keep thinking
[1:39:53.740 --> 1:39:57.580]  you know that's what alexander the great wanted that's what napoleon wanted
[1:39:57.580 --> 1:40:01.660]  that's what roam tried to do that's what hitler tried to do this idea of a
[1:40:01.660 --> 1:40:06.220]  single global government is nothing but the vanity of the rich and powerful
[1:40:06.220 --> 1:40:10.780]  run amok and it never never works out well for the ordinary people of the
[1:40:10.780 --> 1:40:12.300]  planet earth
[1:40:12.300 --> 1:40:16.380]  well i mean that's the issue is that's uh...
[1:40:16.380 --> 1:40:19.580]  morocco bombay in a way is worse than mccain
[1:40:19.580 --> 1:40:24.300]  because mccain was a dead horse you know he was angry he was uh... not you not
[1:40:24.300 --> 1:40:25.500]  that smart
[1:40:25.500 --> 1:40:29.660]  he was discredited he was associated with bush the last phase of the new world
[1:40:29.660 --> 1:40:33.980]  order but with obama it's a fresh horse in the race or a fresh boxer
[1:40:33.980 --> 1:40:37.660]  they put him in and the public is kind of fooled
[1:40:37.660 --> 1:40:40.500]  just long enough for him to sucker punches
[1:40:40.500 --> 1:40:43.420]  you know the new world order now he's betrayed everything he said he'd do on
[1:40:43.420 --> 1:40:45.540]  the lobbyist in the wars and
[1:40:45.540 --> 1:40:47.340]  warrantless wiretapping and
[1:40:47.340 --> 1:40:51.460]  and no rights for detainees i mean the looting twelve point eight trillion
[1:40:51.460 --> 1:40:53.900]  i mean this guy's got it in high gear
[1:40:53.900 --> 1:40:57.940]  and uh... the obama zombies have invested themselves in him
[1:40:57.940 --> 1:40:58.980]  and most of them
[1:40:58.980 --> 1:41:03.220]  uh... you know didn't uh... just vote for obama to repudiate bush like you did
[1:41:03.220 --> 1:41:07.060]  they voted for him because they fully bought into it so see
[1:41:07.060 --> 1:41:11.100]  that's why i was saying obama was worse was because he could sucker the people
[1:41:11.100 --> 1:41:12.500]  better
[1:41:12.500 --> 1:41:15.700]  well i don't know that he's suckering them all that well and again this gets
[1:41:15.700 --> 1:41:18.620]  back to the idea of the alternative media being uh... the
[1:41:18.620 --> 1:41:23.300]  the venue of truth right now i think the disillusionment in in obama is quite
[1:41:23.300 --> 1:41:27.140]  palpable and i know a lot of people are saying well he's gotta be an improvement
[1:41:27.140 --> 1:41:29.700]  because he's our first black president but you know something
[1:41:29.700 --> 1:41:32.700]  idiamin was a black president that didn't work out too well
[1:41:32.700 --> 1:41:34.620]  for the people of his country
[1:41:34.620 --> 1:41:35.380]  so
[1:41:35.380 --> 1:41:39.260]  we've got a move away from whether obama was black or white and we've got a look
[1:41:39.260 --> 1:41:41.620]  at what the guy is doing and what the guy is doing
[1:41:41.620 --> 1:41:43.260]  is just more of the same
[1:41:43.260 --> 1:41:46.660]  i'm thoroughly disillusioned with them there's a story ran earlier today bob
[1:41:46.660 --> 1:41:50.540]  dylan who'd supported him is now backing off in saying it was a mistake
[1:41:50.540 --> 1:41:53.620]  uh... it's getting harder and harder to find somebody who truly is still
[1:41:53.620 --> 1:41:58.060]  fanatically believing in brock obama outside of his immediate circle of
[1:41:58.060 --> 1:42:02.180]  financial supporters and i gotta tell you i don't even trust the polling numbers
[1:42:02.180 --> 1:42:03.180]  that we're seeing
[1:42:03.180 --> 1:42:05.300]  uh... regarding his public approval
[1:42:05.300 --> 1:42:08.380]  because they're not lining up with the the numerous online polls that we're
[1:42:08.380 --> 1:42:10.740]  seeing in websites including my own
[1:42:10.740 --> 1:42:14.660]  uh... we're not seeing you know it's it's more the same
[1:42:14.660 --> 1:42:18.020]  uh... he's going to do what he was being told to do and then the corporate media
[1:42:18.020 --> 1:42:21.300]  will lie and tell us that we all love him and therefore we should shut up about
[1:42:21.300 --> 1:42:22.860]  it
[1:42:22.860 --> 1:42:27.420]  well i mean that's the big issue here is that a lot of people were so horrified
[1:42:27.420 --> 1:42:31.220]  by bush in the secret arrest in the torture in the wars they said
[1:42:31.220 --> 1:42:34.100]  look we just hope obama's better
[1:42:34.100 --> 1:42:36.380]  and then now if you criticize obama
[1:42:36.380 --> 1:42:38.660]  some of the uh...
[1:42:38.660 --> 1:42:42.180]  more uninformed supporters think that you're saying republicans are good
[1:42:42.180 --> 1:42:44.740]  no that's the whole point that's why we made
[1:42:44.740 --> 1:42:48.820]  the obama deception it's showing you that there's a puppet master controlling
[1:42:48.820 --> 1:42:52.700]  both puppets and we want the people is to look past the puppets
[1:42:52.700 --> 1:42:55.620]  to the puppet master and what their agenda is hay
[1:42:55.620 --> 1:42:57.780]  let's indict and arrest the bankers
[1:42:57.780 --> 1:43:00.240]  and you know mike you're saying that's going to be hard to do
[1:43:00.240 --> 1:43:03.580]  because you have this shared corruption in the establishment
[1:43:03.580 --> 1:43:06.340]  that's bringing down mexico that brought down roam that's
[1:43:06.340 --> 1:43:08.540]  you know brought down so many ancient and modern
[1:43:08.540 --> 1:43:10.380]  uh... civilizations and nations
[1:43:10.380 --> 1:43:14.340]  where soon it's just a bunch of crooks and none of them will
[1:43:14.340 --> 1:43:18.340]  control the other ones so they just steal everything and everything falls apart
[1:43:18.340 --> 1:43:21.180]  we're now entering that phase i mean clearly
[1:43:21.180 --> 1:43:25.660]  they're leaving nothing in the nation when they steal the growth the gdp
[1:43:25.660 --> 1:43:27.100]  in six months
[1:43:27.100 --> 1:43:29.940]  uh... and so you have this shared corruption
[1:43:29.940 --> 1:43:33.260]  as things get worse and worse we've got to explain to people
[1:43:33.260 --> 1:43:36.740]  either the global stand power and get more control
[1:43:36.740 --> 1:43:41.100]  out of the crisis they created or we put the brakes on it and say arrest these
[1:43:41.100 --> 1:43:42.140]  criminals
[1:43:42.140 --> 1:43:45.480]  you know instead of just protesting i don't like the bailout like the banks
[1:43:45.480 --> 1:43:49.300]  though these are a bunch of crooks we've got to arrest these people
[1:43:49.300 --> 1:43:53.180]  you know that needs to be the mantra is prosecute them for the crimes they've
[1:43:53.180 --> 1:43:53.980]  committed
[1:43:53.980 --> 1:43:56.900]  of that that is the only way because they're going to continue to control the
[1:43:56.900 --> 1:44:00.340]  voting machines they're going to continue to control control both parties
[1:44:00.340 --> 1:44:04.180]  uh... so so the revolution is just enforcing the law
[1:44:04.180 --> 1:44:06.300]  and arresting these people
[1:44:06.300 --> 1:44:09.820]  yeah absolutely and i think what you want to get into that area
[1:44:09.820 --> 1:44:13.620]  where we the people are going to start enforcing the laws of this country
[1:44:13.620 --> 1:44:17.220]  then it's a whole different dynamic what it really comes down to though if you
[1:44:17.220 --> 1:44:19.780]  look about all this twelve point whatever
[1:44:19.780 --> 1:44:23.660]  uh... trillion dollars that has been dumped in debt on the american people
[1:44:23.660 --> 1:44:27.100]  we the american people don't have to pay it
[1:44:27.100 --> 1:44:30.260]  i mean if you really think about it go through the constitution
[1:44:30.260 --> 1:44:33.340]  and and and and and somebody show me where
[1:44:33.340 --> 1:44:35.100]  i signed a contract
[1:44:35.100 --> 1:44:38.780]  that i would allow the government to uh... borrow this money and stick me
[1:44:38.780 --> 1:44:41.700]  with the payments because i don't remember ever doing that there is no
[1:44:41.700 --> 1:44:45.340]  such contract and the bottom line is american people have to start thinking
[1:44:45.340 --> 1:44:46.220]  about this
[1:44:46.220 --> 1:44:49.060]  if the u s government goes away if we stop
[1:44:49.060 --> 1:44:53.380]  doing what the government says if we simply do not cooperate if we walk away
[1:44:53.380 --> 1:44:57.860]  and let it collapse it's going to take that debt with it and we're not going to
[1:44:57.860 --> 1:44:59.100]  have to pay it
[1:44:59.100 --> 1:45:01.900]  and so this is something that those people are saying we should support the
[1:45:01.900 --> 1:45:03.460]  government right or wrong and everything
[1:45:03.460 --> 1:45:07.300]  okay but if you do it's going to cost you forty thousand dollars plus a
[1:45:07.300 --> 1:45:09.020]  crewing interest
[1:45:09.020 --> 1:45:12.100]  to support the government and at the end after you've worked your life away to
[1:45:12.100 --> 1:45:15.260]  pay off that debt you're still going to have a government that's fondling you at
[1:45:15.260 --> 1:45:18.900]  the airports reading your emails listening to your phone calls watching
[1:45:18.900 --> 1:45:23.340]  you with tb cameras what kind of a deal is that after a lifetime of work
[1:45:23.340 --> 1:45:26.340]  and i think people are looking at that very hard right now
[1:45:26.340 --> 1:45:29.940]  well exactly the power to taxes the power to destroy
[1:45:29.940 --> 1:45:33.420]  and we have admitted offshore banks of corporations that have gotten the lion
[1:45:33.420 --> 1:45:37.100]  share of the twelve point eight trillion just out of the u.s. taxpayers
[1:45:37.100 --> 1:45:39.780]  it's close to twelve trillion from all the other nations that have
[1:45:39.780 --> 1:45:42.140]  that are run by these private banking cartels
[1:45:42.140 --> 1:45:46.340]  uh... feeding into them they've cut off liquidity they're greedily
[1:45:46.340 --> 1:45:50.700]  killing the real economy so they the fiat economy the vampire economy
[1:45:50.700 --> 1:45:54.540]  can come in and consolidate this is a great conquest this is a
[1:45:54.540 --> 1:45:56.500]  uh... you surfer group
[1:45:56.500 --> 1:45:59.740]  taking over our society in this is designed by
[1:45:59.740 --> 1:46:01.420]  their own documents show it
[1:46:01.420 --> 1:46:05.140]  and i don't think the public is mad as they are now has realized the full
[1:46:05.140 --> 1:46:06.180]  horror
[1:46:06.180 --> 1:46:08.620]  of uh... what we're facing
[1:46:08.620 --> 1:46:12.620]  well it really comes down to a very simple fact the instant you start
[1:46:12.620 --> 1:46:16.940]  a debt-based economic systems such as the federal reserve the moment it goes
[1:46:16.940 --> 1:46:18.300]  into operation
[1:46:18.300 --> 1:46:21.300]  more money is owed to that central bank
[1:46:21.300 --> 1:46:23.460]  that is actually in existence
[1:46:23.460 --> 1:46:26.540]  and the only way such a system can continue to operate
[1:46:26.540 --> 1:46:30.300]  is there must always be an ever expanding population of borrowers
[1:46:30.300 --> 1:46:32.340]  which are used to create new money or
[1:46:32.340 --> 1:46:37.340]  the country must engage in wars of conquest to loot other nations to bring
[1:46:37.340 --> 1:46:40.780]  that extra money back into pay the existing loans to the central bank
[1:46:40.780 --> 1:46:44.620]  the problem with creating such a central bank on a global scale
[1:46:44.620 --> 1:46:47.660]  is there is no way for new money to come into the system
[1:46:47.660 --> 1:46:51.060]  and the people living out of that system will be permanently perpetually
[1:46:51.060 --> 1:46:53.020]  enslaved to debt
[1:46:53.020 --> 1:46:56.540]  in perpetuity their children their grandchildren forever
[1:46:56.540 --> 1:46:58.940]  and by the way mark as you know
[1:46:58.940 --> 1:47:01.940]  don't you speak to this we saw the spectacle
[1:47:01.940 --> 1:47:06.180]  last week of the g twenty meeting with literally hundreds of mainstream news
[1:47:06.180 --> 1:47:09.220]  articles time magazine obama's new world order
[1:47:09.220 --> 1:47:11.620]  you know london telegraph other headlines
[1:47:11.620 --> 1:47:15.860]  uh... world leaders hail birth of new world order and then they define the new
[1:47:15.860 --> 1:47:16.820]  world order
[1:47:16.820 --> 1:47:19.900]  they say it's a global private central bank
[1:47:19.900 --> 1:47:21.380]  that will set
[1:47:21.380 --> 1:47:22.740]  uh... currencies
[1:47:22.740 --> 1:47:26.780]  values that will set interest rates and that will set the tax rates
[1:47:26.780 --> 1:47:29.660]  of the nations where there's no order run
[1:47:29.660 --> 1:47:31.500]  and they said they'll be nowhere to run
[1:47:31.500 --> 1:47:35.420]  and the bankers were all smiling and laughing saying will dominate everything
[1:47:35.420 --> 1:47:38.180]  i mean the criminals and engineer the collapse
[1:47:38.180 --> 1:47:42.020]  are openly saying it's a ponzi scheme to get control of the planet
[1:47:42.020 --> 1:47:45.460]  and that we're going to literally be surfs to them
[1:47:45.460 --> 1:47:50.100]  and the only cd their big management group says they want a global tax over
[1:47:50.100 --> 1:47:51.260]  eighty percent
[1:47:51.260 --> 1:47:53.060]  on the average person
[1:47:53.060 --> 1:47:54.420]  because they state
[1:47:54.420 --> 1:47:56.900]  they want a post-industrial economy
[1:47:56.900 --> 1:47:59.940]  the it's the parasite economy the fake bank economy
[1:47:59.940 --> 1:48:03.900]  waging war on the real economy can you speak to that
[1:48:03.900 --> 1:48:07.740]  well economies do wage war on each other and uh... years ago when they were
[1:48:07.740 --> 1:48:10.420]  talking about clashing civilization between the west
[1:48:10.420 --> 1:48:14.140]  and uh... the muslim world it's because at the core of it
[1:48:14.140 --> 1:48:17.660]  it's two different banking systems the western system is based on compounding
[1:48:17.660 --> 1:48:18.420]  of interest
[1:48:18.420 --> 1:48:21.020]  which has led to runaway debt and ruination
[1:48:21.020 --> 1:48:22.420]  for millions of people
[1:48:22.420 --> 1:48:26.820]  while creating vast amounts of wealth concentrated in the hands of a few
[1:48:26.820 --> 1:48:30.300]  on the other hand you have the islamic banking system where loans are handled
[1:48:30.300 --> 1:48:31.620]  as a flat fee
[1:48:31.620 --> 1:48:35.020]  and there's no compounding of interest and the islamic bankers are not
[1:48:35.020 --> 1:48:39.940]  incredibly wealthy but right now the islamic banks are absolutely immune
[1:48:39.940 --> 1:48:42.580]  from all of this meltdown in derivatives problem
[1:48:42.580 --> 1:48:45.260]  that is crippling the western banks so when they talk about clashing
[1:48:45.260 --> 1:48:46.260]  civilizations
[1:48:46.260 --> 1:48:50.580]  yeah they're talking about war between different economic models what was the
[1:48:50.580 --> 1:48:54.420]  war between the united states in russia capitalism verses communism
[1:48:54.420 --> 1:48:57.860]  what was the war against italy capitalism against fascism now we've
[1:48:57.860 --> 1:49:01.260]  become the fascist and we're attempting to bring fascism to the rest of the
[1:49:01.260 --> 1:49:01.900]  world
[1:49:01.900 --> 1:49:04.620]  and the rest of the world is starting to dig in their heels
[1:49:04.620 --> 1:49:08.500]  and that unfortunately boats very very ill for the future of the united states
[1:49:08.500 --> 1:49:12.540]  because we cannot win a new world war we don't have the manufacture
[1:49:12.540 --> 1:49:13.980]  in capacity to do it
[1:49:13.980 --> 1:49:17.540]  well what about the civil war according to lincoln others were was about
[1:49:17.540 --> 1:49:21.220]  economic control was the north going to control western expansion or was the
[1:49:21.220 --> 1:49:21.980]  south
[1:49:21.980 --> 1:49:24.220]  it all comes back to this
[1:49:24.220 --> 1:49:27.740]  yes it absolutely does and lincoln had the advantage that he could use the
[1:49:27.740 --> 1:49:32.100]  emancipation of the slaves as a popularizing device for the civil war if
[1:49:32.100 --> 1:49:33.540]  he hadn't had that
[1:49:33.540 --> 1:49:36.460]  i think the north would have actually lost the civil war
[1:49:36.460 --> 1:49:38.500]  that was their moral authority
[1:49:38.500 --> 1:49:40.180]  that was the moral authority yes
[1:49:40.180 --> 1:49:43.820]  we and our country doesn't really have a moral authority to work with right now
[1:49:43.820 --> 1:49:45.140]  they're trying to find one
[1:49:45.140 --> 1:49:48.900]  they're trying to find a new a manual goldstein supervillain they had osama
[1:49:48.900 --> 1:49:51.020]  bin laden but too many people know he's dead
[1:49:51.020 --> 1:49:52.180]  they tried to float
[1:49:52.180 --> 1:49:55.660]  uh... adam gadan the american al-qaeda too many people know that he's actually
[1:49:55.660 --> 1:49:57.580]  the grandson of an eighty l person
[1:49:57.580 --> 1:50:01.620]  and it just goes on and on they're trying to manufacture a villain or a cause
[1:50:01.620 --> 1:50:04.540]  or something from which they can derive moral authority
[1:50:04.540 --> 1:50:08.420]  to invade somebody else's home and they're trying to do it
[1:50:08.420 --> 1:50:12.420]  in a world that knows the united states government lied to start the war in
[1:50:12.420 --> 1:50:15.500]  iraq they're raising on a busted flush here
[1:50:15.500 --> 1:50:19.100]  but they don't have any choice they did the people who control them won't let
[1:50:19.100 --> 1:50:23.020]  them step off the path won't let them change course won't listen to reason
[1:50:23.020 --> 1:50:24.420]  that this is not going to work
[1:50:24.420 --> 1:50:27.540]  they're gonna roll the dice with millions of other people's lives and just
[1:50:27.540 --> 1:50:30.140]  see hey let's see what happens it'll be fun
[1:50:30.140 --> 1:50:33.420]  because you can attack the globalist but one thing you gotta get them is they
[1:50:33.420 --> 1:50:34.700]  are bold
[1:50:34.700 --> 1:50:37.260]  they are cunning they have amazing will
[1:50:37.260 --> 1:50:41.140]  and they will risk the whole planet it's like when they did it the first a bomb
[1:50:41.140 --> 1:50:43.860]  most scientists thought it was gonna ignite the entire atmosphere to store
[1:50:43.860 --> 1:50:44.580]  the planet
[1:50:44.580 --> 1:50:46.620]  that's on record but they still did it
[1:50:46.620 --> 1:50:50.220]  so uh... just like uh... the hadron uh... you know heavy collider
[1:50:50.220 --> 1:50:53.940]  some of their physicists create a black hole or a stranger let's do it
[1:50:53.940 --> 1:50:58.300]  uh... you know that you gotta give it to them they are bold they are cunning
[1:50:58.300 --> 1:51:01.700]  they are ruthless they are reckless

[1:54:49.180 --> 1:54:53.420]  for micro vero this is an amazing clip last night lue dobbs we're analyzing
[1:54:53.420 --> 1:54:57.260]  this clip right now short clip lue dobbs
[1:54:57.260 --> 1:55:00.380]  has got the president of mexico on and i listen to mexican radio
[1:55:00.380 --> 1:55:03.900]  and they have it in in some english versions as well
[1:55:03.900 --> 1:55:07.420]  and they admit that the government's laundering the drugs that most of the
[1:55:07.420 --> 1:55:10.700]  mexican government is that u.s banks even have a loophole where they can
[1:55:10.700 --> 1:55:14.300]  launder the money and it's now in the abc news about big
[1:55:14.300 --> 1:55:18.300]  banks and brokerage firms doing it and cauldron says look you got a government
[1:55:18.300 --> 1:55:21.820]  officials helping in the u.s and lue dobbs says yeah i've
[1:55:21.820 --> 1:55:25.420]  looked at this i i have to agree with you so it's all coming out folks all the
[1:55:25.420 --> 1:55:29.260]  lies like micro vero just said are coming out here it is
[1:55:29.260 --> 1:55:33.260]  and at the mexican border tonight strong words from president philip cauldron
[1:55:33.260 --> 1:55:37.820]  of mexico in response to mounting violence in his country in the war on the
[1:55:37.820 --> 1:55:41.420]  drug cartels president cauldron met with attorney general
[1:55:41.420 --> 1:55:45.500]  eric holder and homeland security secretary janet napolitano to talk
[1:55:45.500 --> 1:55:49.740]  about actions against illegal aliens guns and drugs
[1:55:49.740 --> 1:55:53.820]  president cauldron made his position on drug trafficking crystal clear
[1:55:53.820 --> 1:55:57.420]  he said that the united states is just as guilty of corruption
[1:55:57.420 --> 1:56:04.620]  as mexico it is impossible to pass tons of drugs or cocaine
[1:56:04.620 --> 1:56:10.300]  to u.s without some great of complicity of the some american
[1:56:10.300 --> 1:56:16.140]  authorities there is traffic in mexico because there is
[1:56:16.140 --> 1:56:21.100]  corruption in mexico and that is true but with the same
[1:56:21.100 --> 1:56:28.140]  argument if there is traffic in united states is because there is
[1:56:28.140 --> 1:56:34.140]  some corruption in united states i don't often agree with president
[1:56:34.140 --> 1:56:38.220]  cauldron on any issue this time i have to
[1:56:38.220 --> 1:56:43.100]  there is no other explanation it goes well beyond indifference and apathy
[1:56:43.100 --> 1:56:47.260]  to the fact that this country is tolerated that border being violated by
[1:56:47.260 --> 1:56:50.940]  drug traffickers who bring in from mexico
[1:56:50.940 --> 1:56:55.500]  methamphetamines heroin cocaine and marijuana in fact mexico is the largest
[1:56:55.500 --> 1:56:58.540]  source and for us as a nation to have tolerated the
[1:56:58.540 --> 1:57:01.500]  immense loss of life the devastation of lives
[1:57:01.500 --> 1:57:06.140]  to addiction of drugs most of which again originated mexico
[1:57:06.140 --> 1:57:10.620]  can only be explained by corruption all right let me stop right there i'm
[1:57:10.620 --> 1:57:14.540]  holding mic over five more minutes so you can comment
[1:57:14.540 --> 1:57:17.740]  ladies and gentlemen i've talked to ludobbs off here i've had him on air
[1:57:17.740 --> 1:57:21.340]  before he is the real deal he has a contract where you can say what he
[1:57:21.340 --> 1:57:24.460]  wants he's being attacked by the southern poverty loss
[1:57:24.460 --> 1:57:28.300]  center as a white supremacist because he's fighting the new world order
[1:57:28.300 --> 1:57:33.580]  that's what they do and he ought to sue him i'm also attacked in this issue
[1:57:33.580 --> 1:57:37.180]  so the point is ludobbs is for real
[1:57:37.180 --> 1:57:40.780]  he's got a lot of courage glenn beck is a counterfeit of a patriot
[1:57:40.780 --> 1:57:43.820]  meant to co-opt our movement and mike i want you to comment on the drug dealing
[1:57:43.820 --> 1:57:47.420]  but also want you to comment i wasn't hard to predict that beck was acting
[1:57:47.420 --> 1:57:50.700]  like a patriot from his past activities and was going to quote debunk the
[1:57:50.700 --> 1:57:54.380]  fema camps when he promised to you know investigate him and he sure enough did
[1:57:54.380 --> 1:57:57.020]  that last night with a straw man argument so
[1:57:57.020 --> 1:57:59.980]  uh... what do you think of that clip and then on the glenn beck
[1:57:59.980 --> 1:58:03.660]  well uh... unfortunately i was not able to hear the clip when you were playing it
[1:58:03.660 --> 1:58:07.580]  uh... so uh... i'm not exactly sure but i mean there's no secret that our
[1:58:07.580 --> 1:58:11.100]  government has been involved with uh... with drug dealing
[1:58:11.100 --> 1:58:14.540]  going way way back the skull and bones fraternity
[1:58:14.540 --> 1:58:18.540]  at uh... yell university was funded with opium money we had heroin coming in
[1:58:18.540 --> 1:58:21.980]  during vietnam iran contra and all the cocaine
[1:58:21.980 --> 1:58:25.980]  so it's a known fact our government leaders are drug traffickers
[1:58:25.980 --> 1:58:28.460]  all right mike stay there i've been trying to talk to you during breaks and
[1:58:28.460 --> 1:58:29.980]  you haven't heard me either we've got some

[2:00:27.420 --> 2:00:31.180]  in the next two segments i'm gonna debunk glenn bex debunking on the fema
[2:00:31.180 --> 2:00:35.100]  camps i'm not trying to treat my own horn but i called
[2:00:35.100 --> 2:00:39.500]  exactly what he was gonna do in fact you guys have that clip we played last
[2:00:39.500 --> 2:00:42.780]  night on bernice where i predicted it before the show
[2:00:42.780 --> 2:00:47.900]  um see if you can cue that back up it was like 17 minutes into the second
[2:00:47.900 --> 2:00:52.300]  hour if you want to know where it was at just one of my precise predictions
[2:00:52.300 --> 2:00:55.100]  uh it gets scary when you study these people this long you know what they're
[2:00:55.100 --> 2:00:58.860]  going to do before they do it uh but they're just so predictable the games
[2:00:58.860 --> 2:01:01.020]  they play uh mike if you missed it i don't know if
[2:01:01.020 --> 2:01:04.140]  you've seen it he did a strong man he showed linda thompson
[2:01:04.140 --> 2:01:07.500]  who put out the fake video of the tank shooting flame out at waco
[2:01:07.500 --> 2:01:10.620]  to discredit all the serious research of delta force and medley being their
[2:01:10.620 --> 2:01:15.180]  shooting people they went to show the uh the uh old train
[2:01:15.180 --> 2:01:19.660]  station now a train repair station a regional repair station for amtrak
[2:01:19.660 --> 2:01:23.100]  and i predicted on air that's what they'd show because that's the one big
[2:01:23.100 --> 2:01:27.580]  popular thing i know is fake from this lady who was clearly an operative
[2:01:27.580 --> 2:01:32.300]  from the mid-1990s instead of the civilian inmate labor camp program all
[2:01:32.300 --> 2:01:35.660]  the documents the houston chronicle the admissions they're getting ready for
[2:01:35.660 --> 2:01:40.380]  marshal law the army announcing it uh you know bills in congress for fema
[2:01:40.380 --> 2:01:43.500]  camps uh and then they just come out and say none of
[2:01:43.500 --> 2:01:47.100]  it's true folks it's crazy if you believe it
[2:01:47.100 --> 2:01:51.260]  yeah absolutely this is an old old disinformation tactic it's called poisoning
[2:01:51.260 --> 2:01:54.140]  the well and what it means is that the intelligence
[2:01:54.140 --> 2:01:59.020]  operatives and the propagandists will plant one provably false piece of
[2:01:59.020 --> 2:02:02.220]  information in the middle of a really serious
[2:02:02.220 --> 2:02:05.900]  concern of the american people and then that's the one that everybody can
[2:02:05.900 --> 2:02:09.100]  always point to to try and ridicule and dismiss
[2:02:09.100 --> 2:02:14.620]  the rest and we've seen it time and time again uh during the uh house select
[2:02:14.620 --> 2:02:18.380]  committee on assassinations looking back into the jfk assassination
[2:02:18.380 --> 2:02:22.140]  they planted this silly story about an umbrella dart gun so that they could all
[2:02:22.140 --> 2:02:25.260]  make fun about it during the clint administration when they were holding
[2:02:25.260 --> 2:02:30.220]  hearings on the abuses of the batf they had a guy show up in full camo
[2:02:30.220 --> 2:02:33.660]  screaming that the government had a machine that made tornadoes if this is
[2:02:33.660 --> 2:02:37.900]  an old old trick and the good news is most americans are now aware
[2:02:37.900 --> 2:02:41.100]  that this is one of the tactics that the government will pull when they don't
[2:02:41.100 --> 2:02:46.380]  want to talk about a real issue exactly or uh
[2:02:46.380 --> 2:02:50.140]  i mean there's so many examples of this that we've seen
[2:02:50.140 --> 2:02:54.140]  over and over and over again and it just isn't working i mean how can the
[2:02:54.140 --> 2:02:57.420]  mainstream media out of one side of its mouth say they're setting up world
[2:02:57.420 --> 2:03:00.860]  government but it's good but then say we're crazy it doesn't exist on the
[2:03:00.860 --> 2:03:03.820]  other and then point it you know some ufo
[2:03:03.820 --> 2:03:08.540]  website you know the and then say that's us i mean people are more discerning
[2:03:08.540 --> 2:03:13.340]  than that now well we have to remember that government and even the new world
[2:03:13.340 --> 2:03:15.900]  order crew are not a monolithic structure
[2:03:15.900 --> 2:03:20.220]  they're all deeply factionalized each is pushing their own particular agenda
[2:03:20.220 --> 2:03:24.700]  and from these conflicting agendas we are seeing these multiple points of
[2:03:24.700 --> 2:03:28.300]  view come out that will be self contradictory and it is a good thing
[2:03:28.300 --> 2:03:32.300]  to allow it to happen because ordinary people reading these stories where
[2:03:32.300 --> 2:03:35.420]  this person says red and this other person says green and they'll say
[2:03:35.420 --> 2:03:38.380]  wait a minute something's not right here and it will
[2:03:38.380 --> 2:03:41.580]  convince them to maybe dig a little bit deeper and when they start digging
[2:03:41.580 --> 2:03:44.380]  deeper that's when they're going to realize the extent to which they're
[2:03:44.380 --> 2:03:47.260]  being misled by the government and by the corporate media and that's when
[2:03:47.260 --> 2:03:51.580]  they show up at prisonplanet.com info wars.com and what really happened
[2:03:51.580 --> 2:03:55.020]  dot com absolutely well micro vero
[2:03:55.020 --> 2:03:59.020]  uh... in closing continue your good work there i'm just really worried about
[2:03:59.020 --> 2:04:03.820]  obama cyber security bill gives obama the real power over the internet
[2:04:03.820 --> 2:04:07.260]  i mean you know sure they're not going to get away with this but the mere fact
[2:04:07.260 --> 2:04:10.460]  that they're saying they're taking the internet over making private companies
[2:04:10.460 --> 2:04:14.860]  give the feds hubs in to snoop without warrants and to be able to shut the
[2:04:14.860 --> 2:04:17.660]  web down the that's their words to protect it of course
[2:04:17.660 --> 2:04:21.420]  i'm really worried about them launching a fake cyber attack and blaming it
[2:04:21.420 --> 2:04:26.060]  uh... on china well remember the fastest way to bring down a
[2:04:26.060 --> 2:04:29.740]  dictator is to force them to act like one where everybody can see it and that's
[2:04:29.740 --> 2:04:31.980]  what's going on with the u.s. government right now
[2:04:31.980 --> 2:04:35.340]  they're acting like a dictatorship and everybody sees it

[2:10:23.740 --> 2:10:26.460]  of power on demand in the event of any natural
[2:10:26.460 --> 2:10:30.380]  uh disaster or outage you get an emergency power backup kit which consists
[2:10:30.380 --> 2:10:34.220]  of the power source 1800 power plan and a high efficiency solar panel designed

[2:10:37.340 --> 2:10:41.180]  remember too that gas generators need gas but the blackout gas pumps can't pump
[2:10:41.180 --> 2:10:44.540]  gas because they run on electricity the solar generator is like having a

[2:11:14.620 --> 2:11:17.180]  everybody and and and i think i succinctly
[2:11:17.180 --> 2:11:21.580]  in 10 minutes boil things down very simply to the world audience here it is
[2:11:21.580 --> 2:11:31.500]  our tea is in austin texas catching up with radio talk show host and
[2:11:31.500 --> 2:11:36.380]  documentary filmmaker alex jones alex thanks for sitting down with us today
[2:11:36.380 --> 2:11:40.940]  my first question is several months after obama stepped in as president of the
[2:11:40.940 --> 2:11:44.540]  united states you make a documentary calling him a deceiver
[2:11:44.540 --> 2:11:48.380]  why he said he wouldn't hire lobbyist all he's done
[2:11:48.380 --> 2:11:52.780]  is hire my powered lobbyist at every level of government
[2:11:52.780 --> 2:11:56.780]  and he's handed the country over to the oligarchs the international bankers
[2:11:56.780 --> 2:12:02.220]  to loot the nation according to bloom bird financial of 9.7 trillion dollars
[2:12:02.220 --> 2:12:07.020]  he has lied about leaving iraq he said he would take the troops out immediately
[2:12:07.020 --> 2:12:11.100]  now he says 16 and 23 months and he's going to keep them there
[2:12:11.100 --> 2:12:14.700]  he's increased the troops by 30 000 doubling them in afghanistan
[2:12:14.700 --> 2:12:19.420]  he's bombing pakistan uh block obama promised that he would only
[2:12:19.420 --> 2:12:22.700]  raise taxes on those making over a quarter million dollars a year
[2:12:22.700 --> 2:12:26.860]  he's now announced wall street journal he's going to change all the loopholes
[2:12:26.860 --> 2:12:30.940]  to tax all americans taking away our
[2:12:30.940 --> 2:12:34.460]  waivers we have for our homes taking away the exemptions
[2:12:34.460 --> 2:12:39.420]  the lies are incredible everything obama has said
[2:12:39.420 --> 2:12:43.900]  has been a lie in your work you talk a lot about the new world order what is the
[2:12:43.900 --> 2:12:47.820]  new world order the new world order is a private group of ultra rich bankers who
[2:12:47.820 --> 2:12:51.900]  are offshore they're above the u.s they're about iran russia
[2:12:51.900 --> 2:12:56.380]  venezuela they are international and they are creating a network of
[2:12:56.380 --> 2:13:00.380]  international laws to regulate and control and dominate nations
[2:13:00.380 --> 2:13:03.740]  they openly state that they want to deindustrialize countries
[2:13:03.740 --> 2:13:08.140]  they want to bankrupt the population they want a poor population that has to
[2:13:08.140 --> 2:13:11.340]  go to the government for handouts they want a
[2:13:11.340 --> 2:13:14.700]  domesticated population so the new world order is what every
[2:13:14.700 --> 2:13:17.660]  other dictatorship is called for in history
[2:13:17.660 --> 2:13:21.260]  there are people who want a planetary dictatorship
[2:13:21.260 --> 2:13:27.260]  run by a group of plutocratic uh financiers it is world government of
[2:13:27.260 --> 2:13:31.340]  foreign by private bankers and what you say is that the american
[2:13:31.340 --> 2:13:35.260]  government is a puppet of the new world order is that is that right
[2:13:35.260 --> 2:13:39.260]  absolutely i am a patriot i believe in the free market i believe in the red
[2:13:39.260 --> 2:13:43.180]  white and blue constitution below rights and everything
[2:13:43.180 --> 2:13:48.060]  that the supposed government is doing is the opposite of that
[2:13:48.060 --> 2:13:51.980]  it is 180 degrees from what this nation is supposed to be
[2:13:51.980 --> 2:13:55.500]  and in every poll the american people are against the wars
[2:13:55.500 --> 2:13:58.700]  they are against the open borders they are against
[2:13:58.700 --> 2:14:02.220]  the police state but the central government does the opposite of what
[2:14:02.220 --> 2:14:06.220]  the people wants and they're setting up this control grid
[2:14:06.220 --> 2:14:10.140]  to try to suppress the american people how do you see barack obama as
[2:14:10.140 --> 2:14:14.940]  american president president barack obama is a deceiver
[2:14:14.940 --> 2:14:20.060]  he says one thing and he does the opposite and that's the only
[2:14:20.060 --> 2:14:25.260]  thing that is constantly barack obama he builds himself
[2:14:25.260 --> 2:14:30.380]  as anti-establishment but really he is completely
[2:14:30.380 --> 2:14:35.420]  owned and paid for by the establishment so how do you see the future of american
[2:14:35.420 --> 2:14:41.660]  politics the united states is a corrupt empire
[2:14:41.660 --> 2:14:45.900]  that has been used by international banks in the global crime syndicate
[2:14:45.900 --> 2:14:50.620]  to expand their empire worldwide they have basically used the united states
[2:14:50.620 --> 2:14:54.540]  like a credit card to pay for their world government
[2:14:54.540 --> 2:14:57.580]  and i see the united states entering the greatest crisis
[2:14:57.580 --> 2:15:04.300]  since its founding 235 years ago so i see the united states as
[2:15:04.300 --> 2:15:09.020]  as a hijacked nation a nation that is being used as a tool
[2:15:09.020 --> 2:15:13.180]  or an engine of international oligarchs international financiers
[2:15:13.180 --> 2:15:16.700]  i see united states in danger of being collapsed
[2:15:16.700 --> 2:15:20.700]  but at the same time i see a massive awakening for the globalist agenda
[2:15:20.700 --> 2:15:24.700]  taking place and so i know that we have a fighting chance
[2:15:24.700 --> 2:15:29.340]  of defeating the tyranny following up on that some people go further and say
[2:15:29.340 --> 2:15:34.220]  that a collapse for america is inevitable what do you say to that
[2:15:34.220 --> 2:15:37.820]  the globalists want to have a collapse in united states
[2:15:37.820 --> 2:15:41.740]  and yes we are in a very real danger of collapsing
[2:15:41.740 --> 2:15:44.380]  because the central banks have gotten this country deep in debt
[2:15:44.380 --> 2:15:48.220]  they've done it by design and now they've cut off the money supply
[2:15:48.220 --> 2:15:52.220]  and the economy of the last year has been in a free fall real unemployment is
[2:15:52.220 --> 2:15:56.380]  up at 20 percent and so yes i've seen many scholars in the
[2:15:56.380 --> 2:16:00.220]  united states and worldwide talk about the collapse of the united states
[2:16:00.220 --> 2:16:04.380]  that is a real danger but again the new order
[2:16:04.380 --> 2:16:07.900]  bankers only want to collapse the united states
[2:16:07.900 --> 2:16:12.380]  so that they can come back in poses the saviors
[2:16:12.380 --> 2:16:16.860]  and bring control over the nation and then reform the united states as a
[2:16:16.860 --> 2:16:21.820]  fascist engine to carry out military operations
[2:16:21.820 --> 2:16:25.580]  against any free nation in the world they openly state
[2:16:25.580 --> 2:16:29.580]  that the united states will be the pit bull the attack dog
[2:16:29.580 --> 2:16:34.700]  the american people will be used to go after every free nation in the world
[2:16:34.700 --> 2:16:38.860]  so the united states is in a process of going from a corrupt oligarchy
[2:16:38.860 --> 2:16:46.140]  to a fascistic hitlerian pit bull meant to go out and literally wage war against
[2:16:46.140 --> 2:16:49.260]  the planet meanwhile the international financiers
[2:16:49.260 --> 2:16:53.420]  will sit in switzerland and london and paris
[2:16:53.420 --> 2:16:57.020]  and berlin and blame america for all the tyranny
[2:16:57.020 --> 2:17:01.340]  when they own our private federal reserve and are launching the attack
[2:17:01.340 --> 2:17:04.460]  one of the things you are talk about in your film
[2:17:04.460 --> 2:17:09.260]  is that the american government is allegedly trying to build a civil army
[2:17:09.260 --> 2:17:13.660]  to be able to use unsuspecting civilians for their own purposes can you
[2:17:13.660 --> 2:17:17.980]  explain what you mean by that yes legislation has passed the house and
[2:17:17.980 --> 2:17:22.060]  the senate and they're in the process right now of ratifying it
[2:17:22.060 --> 2:17:26.540]  to create the words the new york times a seven million person army
[2:17:26.540 --> 2:17:33.100]  and they openly state that citizens will be spying on each other
[2:17:33.100 --> 2:17:37.180]  that this will be a paramilitary force domestically
[2:17:37.180 --> 2:17:41.660]  and internationally to be a civilian force that after the u.s. military takes
[2:17:41.660 --> 2:17:45.260]  over a country then the civilian military force will come in
[2:17:45.260 --> 2:17:50.060]  and administer the country so the united states is being used as a colony
[2:17:50.060 --> 2:17:56.140]  of the offshore bankers to create a social service class
[2:17:56.140 --> 2:18:00.380]  to administer world government you allege that the belterberg group runs
[2:18:00.380 --> 2:18:04.860]  the world who are they exactly the belterberg group is the queen of
[2:18:04.860 --> 2:18:09.180]  england the queen of the netherlands it is the rocker fellers
[2:18:09.180 --> 2:18:12.780]  it is the Rothschilds they write books they brag about it at rocker fall wrote
[2:18:12.780 --> 2:18:17.100]  a book four years ago saying he wants world government into u.s. sovereignty
[2:18:17.100 --> 2:18:20.460]  and they are these incredibly wealthy powerful families
[2:18:20.460 --> 2:18:24.380]  that play with nations and whole populations like their little toy
[2:18:24.380 --> 2:18:27.740]  and they are outside the laws they don't have to follow the laws of the nations
[2:18:27.740 --> 2:18:31.260]  they control and they come in and buy off the governments
[2:18:31.260 --> 2:18:34.540]  and finance those governments to go along with their aims
[2:18:34.540 --> 2:18:40.860]  and the new order is just a super rich international mafia of oligarchs that
[2:18:40.860 --> 2:18:45.500]  are playing god who want to abolish in bankrupt nation states
[2:18:45.500 --> 2:18:49.420]  so they can set up an international order where the planet is owned
[2:18:49.420 --> 2:18:53.500]  by a private bank some people say in the next couple of years there's going to
[2:18:53.500 --> 2:18:57.820]  be a revolution in america could that be possible
[2:18:57.820 --> 2:19:01.820]  the globalist hate america but at the same time they know
[2:19:01.820 --> 2:19:05.260]  that the american people are waking up and there's over a hundred million
[2:19:05.260 --> 2:19:09.420]  armed american citizens who understand that being armed is a basic right and
[2:19:09.420 --> 2:19:12.940]  who refuse to be disarmed and so yes we've gotten the internal
[2:19:12.940 --> 2:19:15.340]  government documents the state police documents
[2:19:15.340 --> 2:19:19.180]  they are very concerned about a revolution because they know that as they
[2:19:19.180 --> 2:19:22.140]  bankrupt the nation as they turn us into third world slaves
[2:19:22.140 --> 2:19:26.940]  that the people will resist and so they are attempting to set up a high tech
[2:19:26.940 --> 2:19:30.860]  police state in the united states as a rearguard
[2:19:30.860 --> 2:19:34.380]  action so that as they've stolen the country blind to build their world
[2:19:34.380 --> 2:19:38.460]  government using the us's energy and money and finance to build it
[2:19:38.460 --> 2:19:43.660]  now they're done with us but the final phase is putting a police state in so
[2:19:43.660 --> 2:19:48.460]  they can so they can successfully rob the united states
[2:19:48.460 --> 2:19:51.580]  without having the american people ever take control of the country
[2:19:51.580 --> 2:19:55.500]  and then prosecute them and arrest them all right how do you
[2:19:55.500 --> 2:19:58.140]  we'll be right back after this quick break and i'll start getting them to

[2:25:11.660 --> 2:25:16.540]  lost all credibility i mean these guys in the case of hannity and limbaugh

[2:25:41.580 --> 2:25:45.820]  helicopter crazy meanwhile it'd be in the local paper
[2:25:45.820 --> 2:25:50.860]  and then now it's in tennessee news oh yeah the army wasn't allowed to but
[2:25:50.860 --> 2:25:54.700]  they still came out and ran checkpoints oh in fact let's play that now i forgot
[2:25:54.700 --> 2:25:58.380]  to get to that we'll do that during the little space we have
[2:25:58.380 --> 2:26:02.220]  uh... the stories up on info wars dot com curtain will write so many stories
[2:26:02.220 --> 2:26:07.820]  what a powerhouse it's already moved into the archive of the news and focus
[2:26:07.820 --> 2:26:12.140]  feature news story piece but i had the state rep on
[2:26:12.140 --> 2:26:16.860]  uh... yesterday and
[2:26:16.860 --> 2:26:22.060]  you know he talked about how they had told the army they couldn't operate but
[2:26:22.060 --> 2:26:24.860]  what we didn't know then was they want to head this weekend that's not confirmed
[2:26:24.860 --> 2:26:29.900]  mainstream news and had the army and the marines uh...
[2:26:29.900 --> 2:26:33.740]  what is it mps from the uh... air force base
[2:26:33.740 --> 2:26:37.900]  outrunning checkpoints on citizens and it said there was traffic backed up for
[2:26:37.900 --> 2:26:42.060]  a mile on one road so the governor says don't do this and they say you
[2:26:42.060 --> 2:26:46.300]  know what shot up we run things now
[2:26:46.300 --> 2:26:49.980]  so let's play part of the state wrap here it is
[2:26:49.980 --> 2:26:54.380]  the wife of police department had plans to conduct a seatbelt checkpoint
[2:26:54.380 --> 2:26:57.900]  on saturday april fourth highway sixty four within the city limits of white
[2:26:57.900 --> 2:27:02.380]  well the checkpoint was planned to be in conjunction with homeland security
[2:27:02.380 --> 2:27:05.740]  and the two hundred fifty first military police in bolivar
[2:27:05.740 --> 2:27:10.460]  after learning about this i contacted representative johnny shaw who represents
[2:27:10.460 --> 2:27:14.540]  that area ask you about this uh... representative shaw you you looked into
[2:27:14.540 --> 2:27:18.300]  this and can you tell me what you've learned and and where this stands now
[2:27:18.300 --> 2:27:22.380]  i can't uh... actually this has been canceled
[2:27:22.380 --> 2:27:26.300]  some calls were made to the governor's office about this on the
[2:27:26.300 --> 2:27:30.540]  earlier today this friday and of course the governor just
[2:27:30.540 --> 2:27:34.940]  simply said i don't need another headache and and of course it has been
[2:27:34.940 --> 2:27:37.740]  kept and i will say that it is
[2:27:37.740 --> 2:27:41.740]  it was a bad idea in the first place i mean doing this climate in this day and
[2:27:41.740 --> 2:27:44.620]  time which we live and you imagine
[2:27:44.620 --> 2:27:47.820]  the army stopping you for a deep belt check
[2:27:47.820 --> 2:27:52.460]  you know so it it really was a bad idea i i don't think it'll happen again
[2:27:52.460 --> 2:27:54.780]  because i think it would have frightened more people than it would have
[2:27:54.780 --> 2:27:58.860]  helped and uh... okay let's stop right there
[2:27:58.860 --> 2:28:03.020]  i wasn't clear with the guys that was uh... the interview after we broke the
[2:28:03.020 --> 2:28:07.020]  news last thursday that was him friday on the radio saying he talked to the
[2:28:07.020 --> 2:28:10.540]  governor the governor said no to the unannounced plan then we interviewed
[2:28:10.540 --> 2:28:14.860]  the state rep yesterday uh... we had johnny shaw on here
[2:28:14.860 --> 2:28:18.220]  and he still thought it had been canceled but then we started having truck
[2:28:18.220 --> 2:28:22.140]  drivers and listeners and others in his pictures of marines and army and
[2:28:22.140 --> 2:28:26.780]  running around with their guns on the streets in fact we're so busy
[2:28:26.780 --> 2:28:30.460]  we need to get that out of the tips inbox and get that posted the marines
[2:28:30.460 --> 2:28:35.180]  but it doesn't matter we have mainstream news marion county news and others
[2:28:35.180 --> 2:28:39.420]  and it says on march 31st 2009 this even happened before that

[2:29:13.660 --> 2:29:17.820]  allowed to do that meanwhile it's just going on all over the state

[2:34:05.820 --> 2:34:10.620]  you know criminally insane that's why we've got her on because we have similar
[2:34:10.620 --> 2:34:13.100]  cases here in the united states england all over the world
[2:34:13.100 --> 2:34:16.300]  where i've seen countless cases being a newshound of where they release a
[2:34:16.300 --> 2:34:19.740]  violent schizophrenic and then they go out and kill again
[2:34:19.740 --> 2:34:24.860]  or they hurt somebody and i don't understand how this can happen
[2:34:24.860 --> 2:34:28.540]  and so she's fighting this and she has the website
[2:34:28.540 --> 2:34:36.060]  timslaw.ca that's tims law.ca but i think it's
[2:34:36.060 --> 2:34:39.020]  better and i know it's hard for her to talk about but
[2:34:39.020 --> 2:34:42.220]  in her own words she's doing this so she can save others and trying to you know
[2:34:42.220 --> 2:34:44.300]  take some good out of this evil that's
[2:34:44.300 --> 2:34:47.100]  happened and that's you know truly a wonderful thing she's doing
[2:34:47.100 --> 2:34:52.620]  she's got a strong christian faith carol the deli thank you for coming on and
[2:34:52.620 --> 2:34:57.820]  i appreciate you sharing this with people so it hopefully doesn't happen again
[2:34:57.820 --> 2:35:01.420]  thank you very much for the opportunity um
[2:35:01.420 --> 2:35:05.180]  i where would you like to start exactly
[2:35:05.180 --> 2:35:08.700]  let's just yeah let's start at the beginning and then break down what's
[2:35:08.700 --> 2:35:14.380]  now happening okay um okay on july 30th of 2008
[2:35:14.380 --> 2:35:19.100]  so last summer i was um
[2:35:19.100 --> 2:35:26.140]  at home here and heard about a murder that took place probably about
[2:35:26.140 --> 2:35:30.940]  45 minutes from my home it happened on a greyhound bus
[2:35:30.940 --> 2:35:37.660]  and um it was quite horrific what we had heard originally initially
[2:35:37.660 --> 2:35:45.020]  was that a young man had been stabbed and decapitated
[2:35:45.020 --> 2:35:48.700]  on the bus and we thought oh my god that's
[2:35:48.700 --> 2:35:55.100]  awful and uh immediately my heart went out to the family of this murdered
[2:35:55.100 --> 2:36:01.500]  person and in the summertime i was working
[2:36:01.500 --> 2:36:05.180]  cooking at a seniors manner making supper for these
[2:36:05.180 --> 2:36:10.860]  senior citizens every evening so that day um which was a wednesday i went to
[2:36:10.860 --> 2:36:15.820]  work at one o'clock in the afternoon and continue to hear about this
[2:36:15.820 --> 2:36:20.220]  this murder but no identification yet
[2:36:20.220 --> 2:36:26.060]  uh dinner time comes around and we all said said grace before the meal and we
[2:36:26.060 --> 2:36:29.180]  said a special prayer to the family of this murdered
[2:36:29.180 --> 2:36:33.980]  individual and um we did the cleanup after that
[2:36:33.980 --> 2:36:36.780]  and i headed home to have dinner with my husband
[2:36:36.780 --> 2:36:40.860]  and um that would have been about seven o'clock in the evening
[2:36:40.860 --> 2:36:47.340]  on the thursday and uh we had just finished having our
[2:36:47.340 --> 2:36:50.940]  dinner and the phone rang and it was my ex-husband
[2:36:50.940 --> 2:36:56.220]  calling and he asked me if i had heard the news on tv and i said well of course
[2:36:56.220 --> 2:36:59.260]  i've heard it i mean everybody had heard it
[2:36:59.260 --> 2:37:05.340]  completely um unusual thing to occur anywhere around here
[2:37:05.340 --> 2:37:11.660]  and um then he told me it was our son and i hit the floor
[2:37:11.660 --> 2:37:19.180]  my husband came over and um helped me get back to my feet i couldn't breathe
[2:37:19.180 --> 2:37:24.220]  i felt like i was going to vomit i ran out our front door and just screamed
[2:37:24.220 --> 2:37:28.620]  no i couldn't comprehend that this had actually
[2:37:28.620 --> 2:37:31.740]  happened and it was my child that it happened to
[2:37:31.740 --> 2:37:35.820]  he um was working with a carnival affair
[2:37:35.820 --> 2:37:39.740]  during the summer months he had gone out west two provinces over from the one
[2:37:39.740 --> 2:37:43.180]  we live in manitoba he was working in um
[2:37:43.180 --> 2:37:47.020]  alberta trying to get together some money to
[2:37:47.020 --> 2:37:50.940]  get his own place and get a car and stuff when he came back
[2:37:50.940 --> 2:37:57.500]  and uh he was in the last hour of about a 22 hour journey on the bus
[2:37:57.500 --> 2:38:01.500]  and this uh the individual who killed him
[2:38:01.500 --> 2:38:04.700]  had only been on the bus for about an hour i believe
[2:38:04.700 --> 2:38:12.460]  and um i my son's only mistake because this let me let me um
[2:38:12.460 --> 2:38:15.820]  make it very clear here this was an entirely
[2:38:15.820 --> 2:38:22.300]  unprovoked attack my son was sleeping by the window seat with headphones on
[2:38:22.300 --> 2:38:27.420]  listening to music and he was dabbed out of nowhere
[2:38:27.420 --> 2:38:33.260]  his mistake was at a smoke break um a little bit earlier in the journey
[2:38:33.260 --> 2:38:38.460]  um he he smiled an acknowledgement to this uh
[2:38:38.460 --> 2:38:43.980]  the the murderer's name was vince lee and just as a as another human being he
[2:38:43.980 --> 2:38:46.700]  just sort of give him a nod and a smile kind of like
[2:38:46.700 --> 2:38:51.580]  you know how's it going or whatever and um that was it
[2:38:51.580 --> 2:38:55.500]  mister lee at the at the beginning was sitting at the very front of the bus or
[2:38:55.500 --> 2:38:59.020]  near the front of the bus and my son was sitting at the very back of the
[2:38:59.020 --> 2:39:03.740]  bus the last row just in front of the washroom and um
[2:39:03.740 --> 2:39:07.820]  when they stopped for the smoke break mister lee took that smile and nod as
[2:39:07.820 --> 2:39:12.220]  as an invitation at some point to go and sit with him so he changed seats
[2:39:12.220 --> 2:39:15.900]  and then about 20 minutes later um attacked him out of nowhere
[2:39:15.900 --> 2:39:19.820]  and that's how these schizophrenics work you know being a large radio show we
[2:39:19.820 --> 2:39:23.100]  run into them and they'll take any little cue
[2:39:23.100 --> 2:39:26.860]  to decide you're the devil or you work for some secret group and you've got to
[2:39:26.860 --> 2:39:30.380]  die and i've had some schizophrenic stalkers that's one reason your story
[2:39:30.380 --> 2:39:33.500]  particularly touched me and they are
[2:39:33.500 --> 2:39:36.860]  they're inherently evil people and maybe you know they call it psychological
[2:39:36.860 --> 2:39:40.300]  or mental whatever they're a demon and i agree
[2:39:40.300 --> 2:39:43.740]  and and that's the end of it but please continue
[2:39:43.740 --> 2:39:48.540]  um my son had no escape route he was in a window seat
[2:39:48.540 --> 2:39:52.460]  at the very very back of the bus mister lee was blocking the aisle
[2:39:52.460 --> 2:39:56.060]  um but when he was initially attacked he was
[2:39:56.060 --> 2:40:00.380]  stabbed in the neck and the upper chest and i guess just the adrenaline from
[2:40:00.380 --> 2:40:04.940]  that first one or two um stabbing had
[2:40:04.940 --> 2:40:09.180]  Timothy up and out of his seat and he actually jumped over mister lee and put
[2:40:09.180 --> 2:40:14.780]  himself in the aisle way mister lee was so focused on on uh
[2:40:14.780 --> 2:40:18.940]  on his rampage on Timothy that everybody else on the bus
[2:40:18.940 --> 2:40:23.020]  was able to get off of the bus i know there's a lot of judgment being thrown
[2:40:23.020 --> 2:40:27.260]  at these other people that were riding that bus but by and large an awful lot
[2:40:27.260 --> 2:40:30.780]  of them had no idea what was going on because they were
[2:40:30.780 --> 2:40:34.700]  sitting forward all they heard was that there was a fight at the back of the
[2:40:34.700 --> 2:40:38.620]  bus they had no idea that there was any kind of a weapon involved
[2:40:38.620 --> 2:40:44.300]  the um individuals probably very close to where this attack was occurring
[2:40:44.300 --> 2:40:47.740]  would have seen the weapon and they would have been trying to get women and
[2:40:47.740 --> 2:40:50.700]  children and everybody else yeah this caught everyone on aware as i
[2:40:50.700 --> 2:40:53.740]  understand that i mean i'm just still you see the stories about a
[2:40:53.740 --> 2:40:56.620]  raped woman lying in the street in one case canada for
[2:40:56.620 --> 2:41:00.300]  four hours bleeding and then you know later dying or i mean i might say i'm
[2:41:00.300 --> 2:41:03.260]  some hero one time i walk out of the bathroom this woman's been choking for
[2:41:03.260 --> 2:41:07.180]  two minutes they're saying doll 911 and i had to push people aside
[2:41:07.180 --> 2:41:10.380]  they got angered at the heimlich and saved her you know it's because i was
[2:41:10.380 --> 2:41:12.780]  supposed to you're supposed to sit there now
[2:41:12.780 --> 2:41:16.620]  my whole issue is but but i mean regardless i think in the past we've
[2:41:16.620 --> 2:41:20.460]  become pretty domesticated i would guess in the past on a bus partially full
[2:41:20.460 --> 2:41:22.860]  somebody would have may not have saved your son but
[2:41:22.860 --> 2:41:25.580]  this guy wouldn't have been able to go on as long as he did and
[2:41:25.580 --> 2:41:28.940]  unfortunately i think folks need to hear just understand his mind exactly
[2:41:28.940 --> 2:41:33.020]  what happened next well yeah i i don't know
[2:41:33.020 --> 2:41:36.140]  i don't know what would have happened if anybody had intervened perhaps there
[2:41:36.140 --> 2:41:38.540]  would have been a lot more people that were killed
[2:41:38.540 --> 2:41:44.220]  too and in that way timothy's being held as a hero because he did allow
[2:41:44.220 --> 2:41:48.140]  everybody else the time and opportunity to exit the bus but
[2:41:48.140 --> 2:41:54.140]  um from that initial couple of stab wounds it it happened very quickly
[2:41:54.140 --> 2:41:59.900]  because lee was focused on destroying that my son
[2:41:59.900 --> 2:42:08.060]  um he proceeded to uh decapitate him and um
[2:42:08.060 --> 2:42:15.020]  continued his rampage for five hours almost five hours i believe it was
[2:42:15.020 --> 2:42:19.980]  four hours and 48 minutes in total all of the other passengers are now off of
[2:42:19.980 --> 2:42:24.300]  the bus um there was a second bus following
[2:42:24.300 --> 2:42:28.700]  and that bus pulled over to offer assistance
[2:42:28.700 --> 2:42:33.100]  as well as a long distance truck driver they
[2:42:33.100 --> 2:42:39.420]  barricaded the door shut to keep mr lee on there the rcmp arrived at the
[2:42:39.420 --> 2:42:45.580]  police and um mr lee taunted everybody with my son's head
[2:42:45.580 --> 2:42:50.540]  and dropped it in the stairwell he went back and further ravaged
[2:42:50.540 --> 2:42:55.020]  my son's body uh removing any and all of his intestinal
[2:42:55.020 --> 2:43:02.060]  or all of his internal organs he cut well when he was apprehended finally
[2:43:02.060 --> 2:43:06.060]  many hours later he had my son's nose tongue
[2:43:06.060 --> 2:43:12.540]  and an ear in a baggie in his pocket some internal organs were thrown
[2:43:12.540 --> 2:43:18.860]  onto the front dash of the bus uh he was in the process of trying to
[2:43:18.860 --> 2:43:23.660]  remove one of his feet he cut off everything that you can think of
[2:43:23.660 --> 2:43:27.100]  that could be cut off and he took everything out of
[2:43:27.100 --> 2:43:31.900]  his body that all of his organs um
[2:43:31.900 --> 2:43:37.580]  his he ate his eyes and he ate at least one third of his heart muscle
[2:43:37.580 --> 2:43:45.260]  as well as other tissue mr lee was observed uh during this attack
[2:43:45.260 --> 2:43:50.060]  cannibalizing my son and smelling and licking his fingers
[2:43:50.060 --> 2:43:58.700]  um there were parts body parts in bags in four to six different locations in
[2:43:58.700 --> 2:44:04.540]  the bus the my son's body itself had had endured over 100
[2:44:04.540 --> 2:44:09.660]  wooden sites um that were devastated i mean
[2:44:09.660 --> 2:44:13.020]  devastated at so this this was a goblin like
[2:44:13.020 --> 2:44:19.180]  bloodthirsty uh cannibal or something out of not living dead
[2:44:19.180 --> 2:44:22.300]  uh specifically i know you're trying to assess blame here you want to stop this
[2:44:22.300 --> 2:44:23.820]  from happening again and we're going to get to that
[2:44:23.820 --> 2:44:26.620]  and i appreciate you having the strength to talk about this to to educate
[2:44:26.620 --> 2:44:28.860]  folks we could stop more of this from happening
[2:44:28.860 --> 2:44:32.220]  why four and a half hours i mean the police got there and then they just
[2:44:32.220 --> 2:44:34.540]  let him run around with the body parts i mean
[2:44:34.540 --> 2:44:37.660]  somebody comes up to a window with me and a knife and a head in their hand i don't
[2:44:37.660 --> 2:44:40.700]  know i think that had been a justified shooting there i mean
[2:44:40.700 --> 2:44:44.300]  this is a dangerous psycho running around with it with a head in his hand
[2:44:44.300 --> 2:44:48.940]  i i would have to agree with you and i don't have the answers as to why i
[2:44:48.940 --> 2:44:52.540]  probably will never get those answers because
[2:44:52.540 --> 2:44:57.260]  the um trial has been done and is over
[2:44:57.260 --> 2:45:02.060]  and there was nobody in that courtroom speaking on behalf of my son
[2:45:02.060 --> 2:45:05.740]  everything here in canada then becomes all about the victim
[2:45:05.740 --> 2:45:10.380]  or pardon me about the criminal who they are no longer
[2:45:10.380 --> 2:45:17.580]  um identifying as a criminal they're identifying him as a patient
[2:45:17.580 --> 2:45:22.060]  he's not being held responsible so the police though let me let him
[2:45:22.060 --> 2:45:26.300]  run around for hours out is there outside the bus while he's
[2:45:26.300 --> 2:45:30.140]  running around with organs and gobbling i mean that that's correct
[2:45:30.140 --> 2:45:34.700]  i don't understand it myself i don't know i i know that they have a
[2:45:34.700 --> 2:45:41.580]  preservation of life policy and since there was no preserving my son's life
[2:45:41.580 --> 2:45:48.940]  their next focus is to prevent any other injuries i don't i don't get it
[2:45:48.940 --> 2:45:54.140]  so this guy can run around with a deadly weapon by doing this okay uh well
[2:45:54.140 --> 2:45:59.020]  i have i have i have real trouble with the fact that mr lee was armed with a
[2:45:59.020 --> 2:46:04.060]  knife and a pair of scissors he did not have a machine gun
[2:46:05.340 --> 2:46:09.100]  i think had they had they unbarricaded the door
[2:46:09.100 --> 2:46:16.140]  and allowed him an exit i don't know so did he finally
[2:46:16.140 --> 2:46:19.340]  i mean he finally settled down at four and a half hours
[2:46:19.340 --> 2:46:25.260]  um he he exited through a window he jumped literally jumped out landed
[2:46:25.260 --> 2:46:27.900]  head first out of a out of one of the windows and
[2:46:27.900 --> 2:46:33.020]  he i believe was tasered and apprehended at that point
[2:46:33.020 --> 2:46:40.220]  with my son's ear nose and tongue in his pocket now specifically that i want to
[2:46:40.220 --> 2:46:43.420]  get into how we stop him from getting out of jail and others liking
[2:46:43.420 --> 2:46:46.860]  what do we know about this this this creature
[2:46:46.860 --> 2:46:51.420]  okay um what i've discovered is
[2:46:51.420 --> 2:46:58.220]  that he was diagnosed schizophrenic catatonic state
[2:46:58.220 --> 2:47:03.820]  in september of 2005 he arrived here from china
[2:47:03.820 --> 2:47:10.380]  in 2001 he was diagnosed schizophrenic in september of
[2:47:10.380 --> 2:47:14.620]  2005 which to me is very interesting because
[2:47:14.620 --> 2:47:17.820]  it is also the same year that he obtained canadian
[2:47:17.820 --> 2:47:24.540]  citizenship by the psychiatrist's own testimony
[2:47:24.540 --> 2:47:28.940]  schizophrenia is not an overnight illness it takes a
[2:47:28.940 --> 2:47:33.580]  a long time to manifest itself and it usually manifests itself much
[2:47:33.580 --> 2:47:37.660]  earlier in life this is late onset schizophrenia
[2:47:37.660 --> 2:47:41.100]  do we know this was chemically induced though i mean we're adding to it
[2:47:41.100 --> 2:47:43.900]  you know a lot of times the serotonin ream taken inhibitors
[2:47:43.900 --> 2:47:48.300]  are associated with these psychotic breaks well apparently there's some
[2:47:48.300 --> 2:47:51.820]  uh law that prevents them from obtaining
[2:47:51.820 --> 2:47:55.980]  bodily fluids to do any of that sort of testing because i asked that
[2:47:55.980 --> 2:48:00.300]  to me it unjustifiable i think is what i was told
[2:48:00.300 --> 2:48:04.940]  that they have to have a reasonable cause to
[2:48:04.940 --> 2:48:09.100]  to obtain those foods and i'm thinking you know
[2:48:09.100 --> 2:48:13.660]  flottering an individual flottering in another human being on a bus is not
[2:48:13.660 --> 2:48:17.340]  just cause to test his blood and body you bodily
[2:48:17.340 --> 2:48:20.940]  fluids for chemicals chemical abuse or whatever
[2:48:20.940 --> 2:48:24.780]  yet yet they can do a breathalyzer for a drunk driver
[2:48:24.780 --> 2:48:28.460]  none of it makes any damn sense to me i agree here in austin they take your
[2:48:28.460 --> 2:48:31.020]  blood without a warrant on the side of the robe of the police
[2:48:31.020 --> 2:48:35.900]  and they have these these rubber stamp warrants that are fake uh just amazing
[2:48:35.900 --> 2:48:40.060]  i mean i know canada's got some weird laws but this is crazy
[2:48:40.060 --> 2:48:43.420]  well well and and this is why i have to work
[2:48:43.420 --> 2:48:47.340]  relentlessly to change them because this is absolutely unacceptable
[2:48:47.340 --> 2:48:51.580]  now to take a step back he was diagnosed schizophrenic
[2:48:51.580 --> 2:48:56.460]  in ontario which is one of the provinces right next door to manitoba
[2:48:56.460 --> 2:49:03.100]  um he was treated in a in a psychiatric facility in a boat
[2:49:03.100 --> 2:49:07.100]  i can't a boat a coke a bit i can't even pronounce it
[2:49:07.100 --> 2:49:10.940]  a town in ontario he was diagnosed schizophrenic there
[2:49:10.940 --> 2:49:17.660]  and he was there for 10 days and then he left against medical advice
[2:49:17.660 --> 2:49:22.540]  and chose not to take his medication
[2:49:22.540 --> 2:49:25.660]  and then oh well that's guaranteed because as you know a lot of the anti
[2:49:25.660 --> 2:49:29.980]  psychotic drugs if you go off them immediately it causes a chemical imbalance
[2:49:29.980 --> 2:49:34.460]  well yeah um but but here's here's my problem
[2:49:34.460 --> 2:49:38.140]  you know on top of all the other problems the fact that he was able to
[2:49:38.140 --> 2:49:43.340]  obtain citizenship in the same year that he obtains a schizophrenic diagnosis
[2:49:43.340 --> 2:49:47.100]  how'd that happen for one thing and and then
[2:49:47.100 --> 2:49:52.780]  he's diagnosed schizophrenic in ontario but the moment he crosses any border
[2:49:52.780 --> 2:49:57.820]  that diagnosis disappears it does not follow him
[2:49:57.820 --> 2:50:01.980]  so once he came into manitoba he had no diagnosis amazing you know
[2:50:01.980 --> 2:50:05.020]  you know we love canadiens are really nice smart people but every time i go to
[2:50:05.020 --> 2:50:08.060]  canada they treat us really bad at the border i don't know if we do that to
[2:50:08.060 --> 2:50:11.740]  you if it is wrong but then i just saw all these foreigners you know that is
[2:50:11.740 --> 2:50:15.820]  not from the us just just just going right through
[2:50:15.820 --> 2:50:19.820]  customs whenever i fly in who can't even speak english
[2:50:19.820 --> 2:50:24.780]  why is that i mean is canada like only for people from like the third world is
[2:50:24.780 --> 2:50:27.900]  at the moment i i i don't have those answers i wouldn't
[2:50:27.900 --> 2:50:32.780]  even begin to guess at them but um the fact
[2:50:32.780 --> 2:50:35.900]  that that diagnosis doesn't follow is a very key
[2:50:35.900 --> 2:50:39.180]  point fact that it was a diagnosis that was made
[2:50:39.180 --> 2:50:42.860]  in the same year that he obtained citizenship is another key point
[2:50:42.860 --> 2:50:47.020]  okay carol carol didelli we've got a break we're gonna come back
[2:50:47.020 --> 2:50:52.540]  let's talk about the website um so people can get involved

[2:54:18.620 --> 2:54:22.060]  and they commit the crimes again and again
[2:54:22.060 --> 2:54:27.500]  same thing with these child molesters just amazing
[2:54:27.500 --> 2:54:31.340]  okay going back to his mother carol the deli
[2:54:31.340 --> 2:54:35.580]  carol okay uh so they have this little kangaroo trial
[2:54:35.580 --> 2:54:39.020]  where you weren't even allowed to have any input and and now they could let him
[2:54:39.020 --> 2:54:42.780]  go from from his facility this is true and you had mentioned
[2:54:42.780 --> 2:54:46.620]  before that he that he could be released from prison well let me
[2:54:46.620 --> 2:54:49.340]  make it clear he's not in a prison right now
[2:54:49.340 --> 2:54:56.860]  he is in a mental hospital where he is a patient he is not a criminal he is a
[2:54:56.860 --> 2:55:02.620]  patient now in canada with an ncr verdict which
[2:55:02.620 --> 2:55:06.300]  stands for not criminally responsible um
[2:55:06.300 --> 2:55:11.100]  coincidentally that also means um no criminal record
[2:55:11.100 --> 2:55:14.540]  because if and when he is ever let loose
[2:55:14.540 --> 2:55:18.620]  like so many of them are and what's scary is they're usually out in one to three
[2:55:18.620 --> 2:55:21.980]  years one to five almost certainly and uh
[2:55:21.980 --> 2:55:25.260]  that when he is released he will not even have a record for having committed
[2:55:25.260 --> 2:55:28.700]  this crime if i shop listed a lipstick at walmart
[2:55:28.700 --> 2:55:32.140]  i would have a criminal record he's done this to my child
[2:55:32.140 --> 2:55:36.540]  and he will have no record of having committed that crime
[2:55:36.540 --> 2:55:40.860]  just amazing absolutely amazing so how do we stop him and others from getting
[2:55:40.860 --> 2:55:45.260]  out and and and you might get into all the cases you're being contacted about
[2:55:45.260 --> 2:55:48.540]  dealing with how other violent people like this get out
[2:55:48.540 --> 2:55:52.540]  well that that's what's really disturbing is because now in the canadian
[2:55:52.540 --> 2:55:58.220]  uh way of doing things um these types of individuals are pulled out of the
[2:55:58.220 --> 2:56:01.500]  criminal justice system and handed over to doctors
[2:56:01.500 --> 2:56:07.500]  where they are reviewed yearly and myself and my family will have to go
[2:56:07.500 --> 2:56:11.980]  before this review board on a yearly basis in order to
[2:56:11.980 --> 2:56:16.700]  keep him there or to try to keep them there to have any input into it
[2:56:16.700 --> 2:56:19.740]  and at that they don't have to listen to anything that we have to say but if we
[2:56:19.740 --> 2:56:22.620]  don't go to those review board hearings
[2:56:22.620 --> 2:56:27.820]  i don't think they've been very long at all um so the responsibility of keeping
[2:56:27.820 --> 2:56:31.980]  the rest of society safe gets put on our shoulders
[2:56:31.980 --> 2:56:36.620]  and i think that's wrong um to be found not criminally responsible and then to
[2:56:36.620 --> 2:56:39.820]  have no criminal record for having done something like this is absolutely
[2:56:39.820 --> 2:56:44.380]  absurd um well shouldn't a jury decide this because
[2:56:44.380 --> 2:56:47.340]  that's how our system of magna card and common law
[2:56:47.340 --> 2:56:51.900]  jury no i understand it it's it's it's the the psychiatrist in the state are
[2:56:51.900 --> 2:56:55.500]  gods and then we have all these cases where they let these guys go and they
[2:56:55.500 --> 2:56:59.900]  kill again well i think that if they if they let them go
[2:56:59.900 --> 2:57:04.060]  if they release them they should have to go and live with them for a while
[2:57:04.060 --> 2:57:08.060]  maybe they wouldn't be so inclined to let them lose
[2:57:08.780 --> 2:57:12.060]  well you got this sure you've got the state and the psychiatrist playing god
[2:57:12.060 --> 2:57:15.660]  so so who will decide if he's released or not the medical board
[2:57:15.660 --> 2:57:18.780]  it's a review board that consists of lawyers uh
[2:57:18.780 --> 2:57:25.180]  psychiatrists and a layperson and i guess here's here's my problem in the
[2:57:25.180 --> 2:57:30.940]  nutshell and this is what i need to change um the system says
[2:57:30.940 --> 2:57:37.900]  okay let the the psychiatric community and the legal community
[2:57:37.900 --> 2:57:41.500]  both define these types of individuals as quote
[2:57:41.500 --> 2:57:48.380]  very disturbed individuals those people their care treatment
[2:57:48.380 --> 2:57:56.540]  and medication is their responsibility so their care treatment in med
[2:57:56.540 --> 2:58:01.100]  that that is all given the responsibility of that is given to this very
[2:58:01.100 --> 2:58:05.180]  disturbed individual when they're not in a position to make those choices
[2:58:05.180 --> 2:58:08.060]  exactly but but they're responsible for themselves
[2:58:08.060 --> 2:58:12.060]  until they fail to comply they do something this heinous
[2:58:12.060 --> 2:58:15.500]  and then they're trying to tell us that they're not responsible
[2:58:15.500 --> 2:58:18.780]  how do you get to have that both ways and who knows if the meds are even going
[2:58:18.780 --> 2:58:21.900]  to work one minute break let's do five more minutes if you can carol
[2:58:21.900 --> 2:58:24.940]  because i want to specifically talk about how we stopped us how we changed the
[2:58:24.940 --> 2:58:29.500]  laws and the same thing goes on here and to a
[2:58:29.500 --> 2:58:33.900]  a different extent but similar because i see the cases in the news all the time
[2:58:33.900 --> 2:58:37.420]  where they let these psychos and schizophrenics out of
[2:58:37.420 --> 2:58:43.260]  jail and they go to town on people we'll be right back

[3:00:14.700 --> 3:00:17.900]  okay we're back live final segment with our guests i'm gonna get into the whole
[3:00:17.900 --> 3:00:26.940]  glenbeck situation one more timslaw.ca and uh his mother
[3:00:26.940 --> 3:00:30.220]  someone brutally murdered by a schizophrenic you know the state says oh
[3:00:30.220 --> 3:00:33.820]  we're gonna let these people go and then have them take their meds you know
[3:00:33.820 --> 3:00:36.780]  they're criminally insane and violent psychotics
[3:00:36.780 --> 3:00:42.060]  uh but that's okay we're gonna let them go and give them meds
[3:00:42.060 --> 3:00:46.300]  and so she's setting up a foundation she's got timslaw.ca
[3:00:46.300 --> 3:00:49.900]  so speak about that but also you said you know on and off air that
[3:00:49.900 --> 3:00:53.340]  you're trying to warn other people to stop this carnage
[3:00:53.340 --> 3:00:57.340]  of allowing criminally insane people out of prison i mean regardless they can
[3:00:57.340 --> 3:00:59.580]  say well it's not their fault they're they're they're crazy
[3:00:59.580 --> 3:01:03.820]  still it's the fault then if i release a tiger in a group of school children
[3:01:03.820 --> 3:01:07.580]  if it eats one of the children i mean the state can't just release these people
[3:01:07.580 --> 3:01:12.140]  and then say oops when they kill again or hurt somebody
[3:01:12.140 --> 3:01:15.980]  whole thing is that i don't particularly i'm not concerned with whether or not he
[3:01:15.980 --> 3:01:19.740]  was in his right state of mind or not the fact is he still did this crime
[3:01:19.740 --> 3:01:23.180]  and he's not being treated as if he committed any kind of a crime
[3:01:23.180 --> 3:01:26.700]  and it was a very one of the most brutal brutal brutal murders in canadian
[3:01:26.700 --> 3:01:29.580]  history and nobody's being held responsible for it
[3:01:29.580 --> 3:01:33.180]  i think timothy's death happened this way
[3:01:33.180 --> 3:01:37.100]  was as brutal as it was to bring attention
[3:01:37.100 --> 3:01:40.380]  to these issues so that change would happen
[3:01:40.380 --> 3:01:43.740]  so that this doesn't continue to happen to other people i don't want
[3:01:43.740 --> 3:01:46.940]  any other family to go through this it took the police
[3:01:46.940 --> 3:01:51.420]  24 hours to notify us because they could not identify my son
[3:01:51.420 --> 3:01:54.300]  by his body because there was next to nothing left of him he was
[3:01:54.300 --> 3:01:59.420]  pulp he had several identifying tattoos but you couldn't tell what they were
[3:01:59.420 --> 3:02:03.260]  he had a huge gaping wound in his chest where his heart had literally been
[3:02:03.260 --> 3:02:10.220]  ripped out and eaten so and now and now they can release
[3:02:10.220 --> 3:02:14.300]  this guy and then really i guess nobody even gets warned about it now
[3:02:14.300 --> 3:02:17.580]  and then he has no record after he's done it specifically though you said you've
[3:02:17.580 --> 3:02:20.140]  got other families because i mentioned to you the cases i've seen where they
[3:02:20.140 --> 3:02:22.780]  let these guys out and they kill again or harm again
[3:02:22.780 --> 3:02:25.820]  you say you're seeing a lot of evidence of that of other people with horror
[3:02:25.820 --> 3:02:29.340]  stories absolutely several other people that are
[3:02:29.340 --> 3:02:33.020]  families that are dealing with uh with the fallout from an ncr verdict not
[3:02:33.020 --> 3:02:38.140]  criminally responsible verdict their their murderers are being let let out
[3:02:38.140 --> 3:02:42.460]  and what's happening is they're being let out with no notifications of family or
[3:02:42.460 --> 3:02:47.580]  or friends and uh no no notification to the community
[3:02:47.580 --> 3:02:51.900]  so these people could be your neighbor this type of an individual could become
[3:02:51.900 --> 3:02:55.260]  your neighbor and you wouldn't even know it and it's happening all the time
[3:02:55.260 --> 3:02:59.660]  in very short time their release and that's you know i think we could all
[3:02:59.660 --> 3:03:03.580]  learn something from the austrian case of
[3:03:03.580 --> 3:03:09.180]  joseph spitzel the fellow who enslaved and raped his daughter for a 24-hour
[3:03:09.180 --> 3:03:14.140]  year uh period of years um and he was he was sentenced to life
[3:03:14.140 --> 3:03:19.420]  in a psych unit for mentally deranged criminals not patients
[3:03:19.420 --> 3:03:24.620]  and public safety remains their number one priority
[3:03:24.620 --> 3:03:29.580]  yeah this guy is criminally insane he's not he's not just insane he's criminally
[3:03:29.580 --> 3:03:34.300]  insane well i mean look i i say executing um you when you clearly got the
[3:03:34.300 --> 3:03:37.740]  witnesses and the guys eating people he's a demonic creature
[3:03:37.740 --> 3:03:41.820]  just get rid of him we shouldn't pay for him yeah well
[3:03:41.820 --> 3:03:45.900]  and canada is the kinder gentler nation i suppose and um
[3:03:45.900 --> 3:03:50.620]  i don't even want to go near the death penalty conversation because
[3:03:50.620 --> 3:03:54.220]  i was misquoted at the beginning of all of this
[3:03:54.220 --> 3:03:58.220]  and uh i think probably several people who would have otherwise been
[3:03:58.220 --> 3:04:01.260]  supportive chose not to be because of that even
[3:04:01.260 --> 3:04:04.700]  having been mentioned well you know that's pathetic that they can't deal
[3:04:04.700 --> 3:04:07.260]  with it you've gone when you have a rabid dog coming down the
[3:04:07.260 --> 3:04:11.260]  street you put it down and the point is that that that fixes the problem when
[3:04:11.260 --> 3:04:14.460]  you've got someone on record who's like this
[3:04:14.460 --> 3:04:18.780]  um you know who says it's mental illness this is a sickening evil person
[3:04:18.780 --> 3:04:21.580]  you know why do people go out and kidnap kids and torture them to death
[3:04:21.580 --> 3:04:26.220]  it's because they like it why do we why do we protect them
[3:04:26.220 --> 3:04:31.420]  and and forget about the victim so quickly there was nobody in that courtroom
[3:04:31.420 --> 3:04:34.940]  talking on behalf of my son it was all about what was going to be best for
[3:04:34.940 --> 3:04:38.860]  mr lee and how to take care of him well carol the deli you're now speaking up
[3:04:38.860 --> 3:04:42.140]  for him and you're a champion and you're no doubt going to save a lot of lives
[3:04:42.140 --> 3:04:45.660]  and i hope folks will visit the website timslaw.ca
[3:04:45.660 --> 3:04:49.580]  thank you so much for the time thank you very much for the opportunity

[3:05:02.940 --> 3:05:07.180]  with our economy spiraling out of control living in the soup kitchens may be
[3:05:07.180 --> 3:05:11.580]  right around the corner no one saw the financial collapse of 1929
[3:05:11.580 --> 3:05:15.980]  many didn't make it and millions ended up in soup lines becoming vagrants
[3:05:15.980 --> 3:05:22.140]  begging for food unlike 1929 we can see this collapse coming we have been
[3:05:22.140 --> 3:05:25.020]  warned and right now we have a very small window of
[3:05:25.020 --> 3:05:29.740]  opportunity to get food storage into our homes before it's too late too late
[3:05:29.740 --> 3:05:33.740]  why is the canadian government telling their citizens to stock up why and why

[3:06:28.140 --> 3:06:32.940]  a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program
[3:06:32.940 --> 3:06:36.940]  of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs
[3:06:36.940 --> 3:06:41.820]  that's fascism it's not about left or right it's about a one-world government

[3:08:45.020 --> 3:08:49.340]  and i was at the madeline with my wife and my newborn son
[3:08:49.340 --> 3:08:53.500]  and i go to the bathroom wash my hands we're about to leave
[3:08:53.500 --> 3:08:56.460]  i walk out and there's all these people around the table at the end of the
[3:08:56.460 --> 3:09:00.460]  restaurant freaking out and this woman is eating bread and is choking and
[3:09:00.460 --> 3:09:04.380]  turning purple i walk up and they're going call 911 911 they're all like
[3:09:04.380 --> 3:09:08.620]  chirping like parrots 911 911 and i started saying hey do the
[3:09:08.620 --> 3:09:11.980]  heimlich they're like you don't know how don't get out of there no and i had to
[3:09:11.980 --> 3:09:15.580]  literally start going okay shoving people out of the way
[3:09:15.580 --> 3:09:19.340]  three deep and the family's freaking out what are you doing that right no god
[3:09:19.340 --> 3:09:23.420]  911 911 they just kept chanting 911 i went
[3:09:23.420 --> 3:09:28.220]  did the heimlich twice big chunk of bread comes out
[3:09:28.220 --> 3:09:33.420]  on the table and the woman and they're like oh you're a hero stay here and i'm
[3:09:33.420 --> 3:09:36.220]  like uh i might have heard or something they're gonna sue me i'm like
[3:09:36.220 --> 3:09:39.260]  let's get out of here because that's how they work folks that's how the coward
[3:09:39.260 --> 3:09:42.380]  slaves operate and that's what they've turned most of the public into
[3:09:42.380 --> 3:09:45.660]  unfortunately just these gelded this afraid oh oh god
[3:09:45.660 --> 3:09:50.220]  afraid of everything so we leave i mean that was
[3:09:50.220 --> 3:09:54.380]  instinctive to go to the heimlich you know because i was on swim team when i
[3:09:54.380 --> 3:09:58.380]  was in junior high and so they would put us through the the ymca
[3:09:58.380 --> 3:10:01.100]  slash fire department little mini course so i knew that
[3:10:01.100 --> 3:10:04.780]  knew how to do it you know for a baby or for a big person or a little person how
[3:10:04.780 --> 3:10:08.860]  to use a chair all that stuff that had the big heimlich and just picked her up
[3:10:08.860 --> 3:10:11.180]  almost
[3:10:12.220 --> 3:10:16.380]  and every day i see articles and they had famous case where an austin cop
[3:10:16.380 --> 3:10:21.420]  got run over at the corner of william cannon at 35 by that
[3:10:21.420 --> 3:10:25.580]  gas station tiger mart and he gets hit
[3:10:25.580 --> 3:10:29.020]  he falls over laying out in the edge of the street fire answer all over in the
[3:10:29.020 --> 3:10:32.940]  summer he lays there for like almost an hour like 55 minutes till the police
[3:10:32.940 --> 3:10:37.180]  drove by and stopped see people don't want to be bothered oh man that's a
[3:10:37.180 --> 3:10:41.020]  guy hurt right there i don't want to call 911 they'll
[3:10:41.020 --> 3:10:44.940]  say something to me oh i don't want to stop i don't want to
[3:10:44.940 --> 3:10:48.220]  to the point that they had to pass laws around the country if you see a car wreck
[3:10:48.220 --> 3:10:52.700]  you gotta stop and you know i still stop
[3:10:52.700 --> 3:10:55.180]  unless i see 10 other cars ahead of me that already stopped you know i'll
[3:10:55.180 --> 3:10:58.940]  drive on pass but i make sure somebody pulled over to help
[3:10:58.940 --> 3:11:02.060]  but at the same time citizens will tattle on their neighbor for their dog
[3:11:02.060 --> 3:11:05.580]  going in their yard or if they think their neighbor spankin their kid and
[3:11:05.580 --> 3:11:08.380]  not even hard when it's not against the law you know they'll tattle or
[3:11:08.380 --> 3:11:11.820]  they'll tattle their neighbors got guns when guns aren't illegal so so you got
[3:11:11.820 --> 3:11:15.260]  those tattletales but they won't get involved themselves they'll tattle on
[3:11:15.260 --> 3:11:18.860]  the neighbor or something and i see the cases all the time where
[3:11:18.860 --> 3:11:22.860]  a homeless man will be stabbed three times in a major you know thoroughfare
[3:11:22.860 --> 3:11:25.980]  with hundreds of witnesses and nobody helps him
[3:11:25.980 --> 3:11:31.980]  or the case a few months ago where a uh schizophrenic again
[3:11:31.980 --> 3:11:36.300]  uh had kidnapped a child off the street and thought that the two and a half
[3:11:36.300 --> 3:11:41.420]  year old had demons in him and he stopped the child's head wide open
[3:11:41.420 --> 3:11:45.100]  all of it and this went on for more than an hour as cars drove by
[3:11:45.100 --> 3:11:49.660]  and finally somebody called and the police in the 15 minutes didn't have a
[3:11:49.660 --> 3:11:52.540]  cruiser anywhere nearby though was you know outside a major city
[3:11:52.540 --> 3:11:55.740]  so they sent a helicopter that landed and the cops ran up and shot the guy
[3:11:55.740 --> 3:12:00.220]  because he wouldn't stop stomping on the on the dead baby
[3:12:00.220 --> 3:12:03.340]  i mean i'm sorry folks i'm driving by i see somebody stomping on a little kid
[3:12:03.340 --> 3:12:07.340]  i'm gonna it's not like i'm looking for a fight i can't control myself it's i'm
[3:12:07.340 --> 3:12:11.820]  gonna pull over and i'm gonna get out and i'm gonna go to town on them
[3:12:11.820 --> 3:12:14.940]  and i don't understand why people don't have that instinct to fight evil to
[3:12:14.940 --> 3:12:21.260]  fight corruption i mean look you i mean you're trying to dehorn cattle cattle
[3:12:21.260 --> 3:12:23.980]  that haven't been really domesticated they're kind of wild on the range
[3:12:23.980 --> 3:12:26.540]  so we're for a large animal vet off and on for several years
[3:12:26.540 --> 3:12:29.020]  you know they're running them into squeeze shoots they will try to attack
[3:12:29.020 --> 3:12:31.900]  even though you're in there with a cattle prod
[3:12:31.900 --> 3:12:33.980]  they'll try to protect themselves they know they don't want to go on that
[3:12:33.980 --> 3:12:36.940]  squeeze shoot now their horns cut off with an electric dehorner
[3:12:36.940 --> 3:12:40.540]  uh you know any animal out there even a bunny rabbit if you try to grab it in
[3:12:40.540 --> 3:12:42.460]  the wild they'll kick and bite and scratch at you
[3:12:42.460 --> 3:12:46.620]  not humans we've been trained to go and just do whatever we're talking
[3:12:46.620 --> 3:12:49.340]  this is nothing unusual folks you corner me
[3:12:49.340 --> 3:12:53.180]  you attack me i see you attacking somebody else
[3:12:53.180 --> 3:12:56.540]  that's what we're born to do is to throw ourselves against it
[3:12:56.540 --> 3:13:01.020]  and i don't understand people so you know i've gone over this and gone over
[3:13:01.020 --> 3:13:05.660]  this before but it's such a phenomenon of they just you know that now they do
[3:13:05.660 --> 3:13:08.780]  metal detectors when you get on buses in the u.s and in canada in a lot of
[3:13:08.780 --> 3:13:12.060]  places you know to make sure you don't have a knife but you
[3:13:12.060 --> 3:13:15.580]  still sneak one on or or have a gun how about people be able to be armed so when
[3:13:15.580 --> 3:13:19.340]  that guy does something like that the people are able to stand up to him i
[3:13:19.340 --> 3:13:23.260]  mean this went on for four hours it's all about the bureaucracy the job the
[3:13:23.260 --> 3:13:27.500]  police stand down you know the police at columbine four hours 30 minutes
[3:13:27.500 --> 3:13:30.620]  the police in blacksburg over three and a half hours
[3:13:30.620 --> 3:13:33.820]  uh the police didn't really stand down the other day
[3:13:33.820 --> 3:13:37.020]  and you know they had a big shootout with the guy but
[3:13:37.020 --> 3:13:42.380]  the point is is that you have this
[3:13:43.020 --> 3:13:47.020]  this continual standing down while you wait for orders the london guardian
[3:13:47.020 --> 3:13:51.500]  and the london telegraph as well had articles a few months ago
[3:13:51.500 --> 3:13:56.780]  try uh emergency emergency flight crews must file paperwork before rescue and
[3:13:56.780 --> 3:13:58.940]  they got a you know oh there's a sailboat term
[3:13:58.940 --> 3:14:01.580]  dumped over two miles out in the english channel they're going to freeze the
[3:14:01.580 --> 3:14:04.460]  death in minutes instead of jumping on the chopper they have to do an
[3:14:04.460 --> 3:14:08.140]  assessment of is it is it a danger to the pilots is the submission they should
[3:14:08.140 --> 3:14:11.340]  undertake who is it do you know uh what exactly is
[3:14:11.340 --> 3:14:14.620]  happening when the emergency and if they don't have all those answers they just
[3:14:14.620 --> 3:14:17.180]  don't go
[3:14:17.260 --> 3:14:20.380]  and they're going we're firefighters we're coast guard we're
[3:14:20.380 --> 3:14:23.420]  supposed to go out to what we don't know what's happening and put ourselves in
[3:14:23.420 --> 3:14:28.540]  danger they're like no no no this is all a form of gelding
[3:14:28.540 --> 3:14:31.980]  and remember about a decade ago the feds had a crusade
[3:14:31.980 --> 3:14:35.740]  dodgeball is mean it makes some of the children feel
[3:14:35.740 --> 3:14:39.420]  like they're weak i was in pe you know in the
[3:14:39.420 --> 3:14:43.100]  fifth and sixth grade and stuff they would everybody would beg
[3:14:43.100 --> 3:14:46.700]  to be in dodgeball every no one disliked it was fun it teaches you to get hit
[3:14:46.700 --> 3:14:49.500]  with something and hit back and you know it's what mammals do
[3:14:49.500 --> 3:14:57.180]  let's see oh no no dodgeball then no tag at recess then no hugging first no
[3:14:57.180 --> 3:15:01.740]  kissing then no hugging now no shaking hands now no high fives
[3:15:01.740 --> 3:15:06.380]  and then they call the police on you if you do now now prisoners are allowed to
[3:15:06.380 --> 3:15:09.180]  shake hands and most you know in up to medium
[3:15:09.180 --> 3:15:12.060]  security maximum they're not supposed to touch so
[3:15:12.060 --> 3:15:17.020]  your schools are maximum security presence
[3:15:17.820 --> 3:15:21.100]  where they're being inducted to go on prozac and riddolin how to tattle on the
[3:15:21.100 --> 3:15:25.500]  parents and this is mind control and then they have these police drills
[3:15:25.500 --> 3:15:28.140]  where they practice the kids putting their hands up and getting on the buses
[3:15:28.140 --> 3:15:33.740]  and learned helplessness is all this is and that's why in england
[3:15:33.740 --> 3:15:37.740]  you see the famous cases of somebody's raping you know somebody's wife and they
[3:15:37.740 --> 3:15:40.940]  had him over the head with a lamp they charge the guy that defended himself
[3:15:40.940 --> 3:15:44.140]  or somebody pushes somebody out a window who's being stabbed to death
[3:15:44.140 --> 3:15:47.260]  the police come and say we're charging you for pushing them through the window
[3:15:47.260 --> 3:15:50.700]  or you hear about the us where thieves keep falling through skylights and
[3:15:50.700 --> 3:15:54.940]  breaking their legs they they they sue you and win
[3:15:54.940 --> 3:15:58.940]  i mean i'm serious that that's i mean google um i don't know if you found
[3:15:58.940 --> 3:16:01.340]  another one
[3:16:04.940 --> 3:16:11.740]  um google um thief sues homeowner and you'll get a whole bunch of articles
[3:16:11.740 --> 3:16:16.460]  see this is the system it's all about binding down good people it's all about
[3:16:16.460 --> 3:16:20.540]  criminalizing the regular public going through the body scanners and now
[3:16:20.540 --> 3:16:24.140]  scanning your naked body taking your shoes off submitting being asked
[3:16:24.140 --> 3:16:27.580]  questions oh don't worry we don't profile it's for everyone
[3:16:27.580 --> 3:16:31.900]  see this is about inducting you into slavery here's the uh CNN piece for the
[3:16:31.900 --> 3:16:36.380]  audio no high fives no touching at all
[3:16:36.380 --> 3:16:39.980]  11-year-old stefin pavers nick may only be in sixth grade
[3:16:39.980 --> 3:16:43.820]  but he's old enough to question millford school policy
[3:16:43.820 --> 3:16:47.420]  if you hug someone it's considered horse play and
[3:16:47.420 --> 3:16:51.340]  this stuff is going to be met with severe actions that's what he and fellow
[3:16:51.340 --> 3:16:54.220]  students at east shore middle school say they've been told
[3:16:54.220 --> 3:16:58.060]  his father is not happy now it's almost as if
[3:16:58.060 --> 3:17:01.740]  it's a sanitized school where nobody can you know you have to
[3:17:01.740 --> 3:17:05.420]  keep your distance from everybody and that's not what school is about
[3:17:05.420 --> 3:17:09.980]  the district sent home a reminder about its no touch policy this week after
[3:17:09.980 --> 3:17:12.860]  several students reportedly fought and one was
[3:17:12.860 --> 3:17:17.660]  badly kicked in the groin the letter states let's stop there let's stop there
[3:17:17.660 --> 3:17:22.300]  see if one person's bad you're all guilty that's how
[3:17:22.300 --> 3:17:26.140]  reeducation camps work oh bob didn't accept that Stalin
[3:17:26.140 --> 3:17:29.500]  is god you're all gonna get your food cut in half
[3:17:29.500 --> 3:17:32.220]  and have to do double duty out there at the rock pile
[3:17:32.220 --> 3:17:35.580]  and then everybody goes and beats up you know the guy that didn't worship
[3:17:35.580 --> 3:17:39.740]  Stalin is god that's how this reeducation mind
[3:17:39.740 --> 3:17:43.740]  control works oh we had somebody kick him the groin as if kids don't do that
[3:17:43.740 --> 3:17:48.620]  now all of you are prisoners all of you are bad the feds are riding all this
[3:17:48.620 --> 3:17:51.980]  criteria so here you go go back to it the letter states
[3:17:51.980 --> 3:17:56.780]  physical contact is prohibited are some teachers letting you do the high five
[3:17:56.780 --> 3:18:01.020]  so no like some kids get away with it but others
[3:18:01.020 --> 3:18:04.540]  they get in trouble they're gonna play games and what if they're out on the
[3:18:04.540 --> 3:18:07.820]  playground like recess okay what about gym class
[3:18:07.820 --> 3:18:12.620]  you know yeah gym class is physical well i think zero contact is pretty
[3:18:12.620 --> 3:18:16.460]  unrealistic because kids will be kids and they're gonna touch each other they're
[3:18:16.460 --> 3:18:20.060]  gonna even rough house or whatever it was
[3:18:20.060 --> 3:18:23.500]  that's the whole point dad they want to get your kids in the system
[3:18:23.500 --> 3:18:26.620]  in austin they arrest kids every day for being late to class three times
[3:18:26.620 --> 3:18:29.900]  doesn't violate state law it doesn't constitute a truancy
[3:18:29.900 --> 3:18:34.140]  14 truancies in a semester is truancy but they misapply it
[3:18:34.140 --> 3:18:37.660]  threaten the parents and they sign their kids over to probation it's a criminal
[3:18:37.660 --> 3:18:41.260]  dirt-backed government all over the country they've caught judges
[3:18:41.260 --> 3:18:44.620]  falsely putting kids in jail for six months a year to get millions of
[3:18:44.620 --> 3:18:47.180]  dollars of kickbacks from the private prisons
[3:18:47.180 --> 3:18:50.300]  it's a criminal government that ships in the narcotics
[3:18:50.300 --> 3:18:54.220]  did you hear lou dobbs admitted earlier
[3:18:54.620 --> 3:18:56.860]  play a little bit more of it i'm gonna come back into the blend back in your
[3:18:56.860 --> 3:19:01.580]  phone calls here we go even rough house or whatever but uh you gotta keep it
[3:19:01.580 --> 3:19:04.380]  in line it kind of like puts us down because if we do
[3:19:04.380 --> 3:19:07.420]  good on a test or if we just like happy to see
[3:19:07.420 --> 3:19:11.180]  like our friends we can't give them high fives
[3:19:11.180 --> 3:19:15.100]  i'm like we get in trouble for it
[3:19:15.900 --> 3:19:18.940]  well there you have it ladies and gentlemen i mean if that is in nineteen
[3:19:18.940 --> 3:19:22.140]  in 1984 the kids were allowed to shake hands in the government training camp
[3:19:22.140 --> 3:19:25.500]  see this is mind control this is zero
[3:19:25.500 --> 3:19:29.500]  tolerance this is we're on your back and it doesn't matter if right here in
[3:19:29.500 --> 3:19:32.860]  austin the judges get kickbacks and they build giant prisons for the kids
[3:19:32.860 --> 3:19:35.260]  they haven't committed crimes they don't care
[3:19:35.260 --> 3:19:37.980]  they're gonna keep doing it they're gonna take your bank account they've
[3:19:37.980 --> 3:19:41.980]  already stolen the gdp in six months they're gonna steal lord
[3:19:41.980 --> 3:19:45.340]  and they got troops illegally running checkpoints nationwide and the governor
[3:19:45.340 --> 3:19:47.740]  says don't do it in Tennessee and the troops say you know what
[3:19:47.740 --> 3:19:51.740]  we're gonna do it shut up we got the weapons we weren't for made off
[3:19:51.740 --> 3:19:54.940]  shut up we run american now we're taking your money

[3:24:12.460 --> 3:24:15.980]  all right there have been huge new developments
[3:24:15.980 --> 3:24:21.180]  in the bingham shooting in new york now you know as we always revert
[3:24:21.180 --> 3:24:25.340]  reserve judgment that it's a government operation
[3:24:25.340 --> 3:24:29.660]  until we have time to do research and in hindsight the evidence will come out
[3:24:29.660 --> 3:24:32.940]  if it was a government op or an op they allowed
[3:24:32.940 --> 3:24:37.020]  different variants of false flag we know columbine and
[3:24:37.020 --> 3:24:40.460]  some of the other shootings in colorado and texas were staged the
[3:24:40.460 --> 3:24:44.140]  buford furrow jewish children's centered thing was staged
[3:24:44.140 --> 3:24:46.460]  go through that evidence you can just google it i mean they were all at
[3:24:46.460 --> 3:24:50.540]  military bases trained mind control programs publicly government
[3:24:50.540 --> 3:24:54.060]  cell phones you know government phone numbers the school's being half empty
[3:24:54.060 --> 3:24:58.300]  standing down 127 bombs brought into the building at
[3:24:58.300 --> 3:25:01.820]  columbine ordering the stand down
[3:25:01.820 --> 3:25:05.660]  there's been big new developments and i already saw some of this in the news and
[3:25:05.660 --> 3:25:08.860]  had some tips on it we have listeners everywhere
[3:25:08.860 --> 3:25:12.060]  we have a listener we've confirmed his name where he works he can't say where he
[3:25:12.060 --> 3:25:18.540]  works because of this um that's all i'm going to say
[3:25:18.540 --> 3:25:22.620]  we don't let you know they're police or who they are
[3:25:22.620 --> 3:25:27.100]  but it came out in the news this morning
[3:25:27.580 --> 3:25:31.980]  this is coming up in about 15 minutes i gotta do the glenbeck thing
[3:25:31.980 --> 3:25:38.060]  this is huge breaking news it came out that the shooter
[3:25:38.060 --> 3:25:41.820]  delivered a letter to the news station saying i'm going to go shoot people kill
[3:25:41.820 --> 3:25:45.100]  people and basically where
[3:25:47.180 --> 3:25:52.540]  it turns out it's just so sick see under these protocols they got to call the
[3:25:52.540 --> 3:25:59.740]  feds first to see what they're going to do so by itself it means they stand down
[3:25:59.740 --> 3:26:03.500]  how dumb are these government people it's like the 911 caller
[3:26:03.500 --> 3:26:07.180]  uh with the guy in pittsburgh who killed the three cops
[3:26:07.180 --> 3:26:11.100]  and hurt two others critically wounded them
[3:26:11.100 --> 3:26:15.020]  the mother says he's got guns here he's dangerous and the 911 lady doesn't tell
[3:26:15.020 --> 3:26:17.420]  the police that i mean it's just these people
[3:26:17.420 --> 3:26:22.220]  i mean i mean is it total ineptitude or is it an operation
[3:26:22.220 --> 3:26:25.660]  i don't know you know it turns out that um
[3:26:25.660 --> 3:26:29.180]  the pittsburgh shooter was in some weird government psychiatric facility
[3:26:29.180 --> 3:26:32.380]  and then the evidence starts mounting i mean a lot of times this is government
[3:26:32.380 --> 3:26:36.140]  i mean they really do this they wind up these lunatics give them weapons and
[3:26:36.140 --> 3:26:38.460]  have them do but i don't think that's the case with this guy
[3:26:38.460 --> 3:26:42.460]  but with the one in new york it's starting to look like that okay look
[3:26:42.460 --> 3:26:47.260]  glenbeck folks is a danger to the country uh but he's got his free speech
[3:26:47.260 --> 3:26:50.860]  he is a judas goat he is a benedict arnold he is a traitor
[3:26:50.860 --> 3:26:55.100]  he isn't out there saying he's uh you know with the new world order and being
[3:26:55.100 --> 3:26:59.180]  honest about it then you can dislike him but respecting
[3:26:59.180 --> 3:27:03.100]  he's doing the opposite he whenever he talks about patriot stuff he acts kooky
[3:27:03.100 --> 3:27:06.940]  and crazy to discredit it then he always tries to get our confidence that
[3:27:06.940 --> 3:27:09.820]  later says a restaurant poll supporters are mcvay types
[3:27:09.820 --> 3:27:14.060]  and i know him so well that i said you watch he's going to debunk him
[3:27:14.060 --> 3:27:17.740]  and he announced last week yes it's bull i'm going to debunk it next week
[3:27:17.740 --> 3:27:20.860]  and we predicted okay he's going to claim the train station
[3:27:20.860 --> 3:27:24.380]  up in illinois and there's another one in indiana
[3:27:24.380 --> 3:27:27.740]  these train repair shops he's going to go do the linda thompson deal
[3:27:27.740 --> 3:27:32.620]  who we know is a disinfo operative and sure enough that's what he did
[3:27:32.620 --> 3:27:36.460]  it's a strong man you've got all these real instances of fema camps i covered
[3:27:36.460 --> 3:27:39.660]  yesterday mainstream news congressional testimony
[3:27:39.660 --> 3:27:43.580]  you know houston chronicle new york times wall street journal miami herald
[3:27:43.580 --> 3:27:47.180]  all admitting it congressman admitting it that you know where they're at
[3:27:47.180 --> 3:27:50.300]  civilian inmate labor camp program everything we covered
[3:27:50.300 --> 3:27:54.540]  yesterday none of that he ain't gonna touch that with ten foot poll we sent
[3:27:54.540 --> 3:27:58.540]  this all to him weeks ago you really want to know here it is glenn
[3:27:58.540 --> 3:28:02.380]  and i even know through contacts of his producer at fox they don't want it
[3:28:02.380 --> 3:28:07.180]  thank you we'll look at it click he comes out with a straw man
[3:28:07.180 --> 3:28:10.380]  let's start rolling this and it's just itself explanatory
[3:28:10.380 --> 3:28:13.900]  and he also has a thing with blood it's glenn beck on the screen with blood
[3:28:13.900 --> 3:28:18.860]  coming out his eyes with smoke coming out saying crazy time
[3:28:18.860 --> 3:28:22.220]  so and then they bring in popular mechanics the disinfo operatives
[3:28:22.220 --> 3:28:25.740]  literally government run admittedly here it is
[3:28:25.740 --> 3:28:29.660]  well over a month ago i had a call it was like the one
[3:28:29.660 --> 3:28:33.180]  billionth call from a woman who asked me about fees and
[3:28:33.180 --> 3:28:36.860]  fema prison camps and i said to my producer i said can we just please
[3:28:36.860 --> 3:28:41.180]  debunk this or prove it to be accurate i kind of snapped on the lady because
[3:28:41.180 --> 3:28:45.180]  honestly i'm sick of seeing the emails about the fema camps i got something
[3:28:45.180 --> 3:28:49.100]  from friends that was about mancy polosi and it was it was completely bogus
[3:28:49.100 --> 3:28:53.100]  look let's just stick to the facts there's enough truth out there that
[3:28:53.100 --> 3:28:56.540]  pisses people off we don't need all the the lies
[3:28:56.540 --> 3:29:00.060]  the basic idea is that we are setting up so you just said we don't even know the
[3:29:00.060 --> 3:29:03.500]  lies i mean i just i have state reps on and the
[3:29:03.500 --> 3:29:07.180]  governors in the newspaper saying i see no army checkpoints and they run them
[3:29:07.180 --> 3:29:10.140]  all over tennessee and it's in the newspaper
[3:29:10.140 --> 3:29:14.380]  and i've got major publications saying i'm a liar north com hasn't announced
[3:29:14.380 --> 3:29:17.340]  this and isn't doing it
[3:29:18.300 --> 3:29:22.140]  and then the fema camps are real they're on record and bex saying we're liars and
[3:29:22.140 --> 3:29:25.340]  he goes and shows a straw man we'll come back and finish it

[3:29:36.380 --> 3:29:39.900]  lot of it i mean these people there's no end to them but what is operation
[3:29:39.900 --> 3:29:44.620]  north would say it says we'll commit sniper attacks in new york
[3:29:44.620 --> 3:29:50.940]  and in dc and in miami and then we'll blame it on patsies

[3:33:41.020 --> 3:33:43.500]  betrayer and a liar and i knew he was going to come out
[3:33:43.500 --> 3:33:47.020]  and stab us in the back and say fema cams weren't real and i was right and i
[3:33:47.020 --> 3:33:50.700]  pegged exactly what he was going to air and what he was going to do on record
[3:33:50.700 --> 3:33:54.060]  weeks ago
[3:33:54.060 --> 3:33:57.660]  okay and he's having nine 12 meetings everywhere
[3:33:57.660 --> 3:34:01.420]  brainwashing everybody and he always does this the new orders real it's
[3:34:01.420 --> 3:34:04.700]  north korea it's china at the end of his program he goes this is a real
[3:34:04.700 --> 3:34:07.820]  concentration camp and i'm going to tell you tomorrow what it is
[3:34:07.820 --> 3:34:11.900]  it's north korea it's north korean camp what he doesn't tell you is that
[3:34:11.900 --> 3:34:15.020]  donald rumsfeld and abb helped prop them up
[3:34:15.020 --> 3:34:18.300]  so see it's always about the outsider they're bad over here we don't have
[3:34:18.300 --> 3:34:22.300]  camps here we're the good guys anyways let's play some of the hit piece it's
[3:34:22.300 --> 3:34:26.780]  just it just speaks for itself it's just absolute bull here we go
[3:34:26.780 --> 3:34:30.700]  concentration camps to be used against us citizens
[3:34:30.700 --> 3:34:35.340]  now along with the 9-11 truthers this is one of the most pervasive conspiracy
[3:34:35.340 --> 3:34:38.780]  theories on the internet because it comes with supposed video stop i can't
[3:34:38.780 --> 3:34:41.820]  help it proof notice how he does guilt by association
[3:34:41.820 --> 3:34:45.580]  they're going to show you fake fema camp put out by the government is info
[3:34:45.580 --> 3:34:50.460]  operative in the 95 linda thompson
[3:34:50.460 --> 3:34:54.220]  and then they're going to tie them a 9-11 truth like oh this has been
[3:34:54.220 --> 3:34:57.740]  discredited and so was that and everybody knows 9-11 is discredited
[3:34:57.740 --> 3:35:01.420]  he says that coming up later just all mass mind think everybody knows there's
[3:35:01.420 --> 3:35:05.420]  on a new world order everybody knows the government loves you here here we go
[3:35:05.420 --> 3:35:09.500]  that video now has had over well over a million views on youtube
[3:35:09.500 --> 3:35:12.220]  so we set out to get the truth and quite honestly
[3:35:12.220 --> 3:35:16.220]  i don't believe that there are fema concentration camps i think that sounds
[3:35:16.220 --> 3:35:21.020]  kind of nuts but if there are i'll show them to you
[3:35:21.020 --> 3:35:25.580]  if there aren't i'll show that to you we set out to get the truth on it and
[3:35:25.580 --> 3:35:29.180]  after our initial research i came in and i said wait a minute
[3:35:29.180 --> 3:35:31.500]  wait a minute wait a minute we can't debunk this
[3:35:31.500 --> 3:35:35.420]  well no i thought we had done enough research to get the video i wanted to
[3:35:35.420 --> 3:35:40.140]  line up video side by side apparently there hadn't been any debunking done
[3:35:40.140 --> 3:35:43.980]  at all and there was no video side by side well predictably the
[3:35:43.980 --> 3:35:46.940]  media started claiming that somehow or another i believe in these conspiracy
[3:35:46.940 --> 3:35:50.220]  theories even though i said on the air a million times i don't
[3:35:50.220 --> 3:35:54.220]  and i've said that for years uh not to mention the entire time
[3:35:54.220 --> 3:35:57.260]  they were running their mouths we were working with an independent group to
[3:35:57.260 --> 3:36:01.340]  debunk them or to prove them i also said that on the
[3:36:01.340 --> 3:36:06.220]  air over and over and over again but who listens to context
[3:36:06.220 --> 3:36:11.260]  oh he makes me sick anyways um that's mean to women he's not effeminate he's
[3:36:11.260 --> 3:36:15.980]  got the male fake effeminate little act was a little date for the day uh
[3:36:15.980 --> 3:36:22.620]  mags uh they're on the show now these guys really make me sick um
[3:36:22.620 --> 3:36:26.300]  again i really just wanted to tell the truth and and now i got called to cook
[3:36:26.300 --> 3:36:30.300]  all i was doing was we're investigating and i debunked them
[3:36:30.300 --> 3:36:33.260]  since he plays both sides of the fence here
[3:36:33.260 --> 3:36:36.860]  just keep playing it oh god keep playing him no
[3:36:36.860 --> 3:36:40.220]  they can actually set the record straight here is james mags he's the
[3:36:40.220 --> 3:36:43.340]  editor-in-chief of that independent group i was talking about otherwise known
[3:36:43.340 --> 3:36:46.220]  as popular mechanics look what he puts on screen
[3:36:46.220 --> 3:36:50.140]  in the writing edge of insanity with blood pouring out of the eyes everybody
[3:36:50.140 --> 3:36:54.060]  knows now is not true because of popular mechanics except rosio donnell
[3:36:54.060 --> 3:36:57.340]  james is here now to do the same with the fema camps okay
[3:36:57.340 --> 3:37:00.700]  let's just start with it the easy stuff here there is
[3:37:00.700 --> 3:37:04.220]  there are um and i just want to collapse this as quickly as possible
[3:37:04.220 --> 3:37:07.980]  there are things that yes fema has a right to have
[3:37:07.980 --> 3:37:11.420]  camps and they could do things to help people and if you wanted to go down the
[3:37:11.420 --> 3:37:14.940]  crazy road of stop right there be
[3:37:14.940 --> 3:37:18.860]  they could be turned into something bad back at up 10 seconds
[3:37:18.860 --> 3:37:22.220]  i read you all the executive orders the fema documents on record yesterday on
[3:37:22.220 --> 3:37:26.300]  the hour and a half plus expose we did
[3:37:26.300 --> 3:37:31.900]  i played senate and house on the floor as they said martial law has been
[3:37:31.900 --> 3:37:35.500]  threatened fema's above us congress no longer has the authority this is
[3:37:35.500 --> 3:37:39.820]  martial law so fema doesn't have the right to
[3:37:39.820 --> 3:37:44.860]  have these camps you saw them in new orleans taking the guns
[3:37:44.860 --> 3:37:48.220]  i read earlier yesterday well one of the former fema directors saying
[3:37:48.220 --> 3:37:53.180]  it's our job to during a collapse of society to keep the alternative media
[3:37:53.180 --> 3:37:56.860]  from exposing what we're doing they're there to make sure the bankers can rape
[3:37:56.860 --> 3:37:59.180]  you financially get that through your head that's why
[3:37:59.180 --> 3:38:03.980]  they're running army checkpoints everywhere
[3:38:03.980 --> 3:38:06.300]  but you know what you're going to be discredited again back i know your job
[3:38:06.300 --> 3:38:08.860]  is to stall folks long enough so we don't save the country
[3:38:08.860 --> 3:38:11.820]  but you know there's no neural order now it's all admitted there's no global
[3:38:11.820 --> 3:38:15.100]  tax global currency now it's all admitted and you keep denying all this fema
[3:38:15.100 --> 3:38:18.460]  camp crap when it's in the news oh they're building fema camps for the
[3:38:18.460 --> 3:38:22.300]  homeless but you've got to go to them you're not allowed to be homeless
[3:38:22.300 --> 3:38:26.300]  we send cameras out to where it's happening
[3:38:26.300 --> 3:38:30.300]  but so you can't counter us in our facts you gotta make this stuff up just go
[3:38:30.300 --> 3:38:34.060]  back to it yes fema has a right to have
[3:38:34.060 --> 3:38:37.500]  camps and they could do things to help people and if you wanted to go down the
[3:38:37.500 --> 3:38:41.100]  crazy road of but they could be turned into
[3:38:41.100 --> 3:38:44.540]  they actually could be but there's like a million other steps that have to
[3:38:44.540 --> 3:38:47.100]  happen which of all that's correct and what we did was we
[3:38:47.100 --> 3:38:50.380]  looked into these claims you know you can't go and visit
[3:38:50.380 --> 3:38:54.140]  every one of the 600 sites that some of the conspiracy theorists claim
[3:38:54.140 --> 3:38:57.100]  so we started looking at the ones that are most popular on the big internet
[3:38:57.100 --> 3:39:01.980]  okay and let's show the video first show me the video that is on the internet
[3:39:01.980 --> 3:39:06.620]  this is one of the so-called concentration camps or
[3:39:06.620 --> 3:39:12.940]  this one's actually go ahead show it i guess a death camp
[3:39:12.940 --> 3:39:17.500]  do we have it okay we don't have it yet i can't keep going because this is kind
[3:39:17.500 --> 3:39:22.460]  of built around the video that was the reason why we waited
[3:39:22.460 --> 3:39:28.700]  there it is this small building is the only way into a particular fenced area
[3:39:28.700 --> 3:39:32.780]  inside this building we see more of the motion activated detectors
[3:39:32.780 --> 3:39:35.980]  electronic turn okay there's no sound how come i'm hearing the sound here
[3:39:35.980 --> 3:39:39.660]  frank okay this is a this is something where they're
[3:39:39.660 --> 3:39:43.020]  showing a so-called concentration camp these are
[3:39:43.020 --> 3:39:48.700]  turn styles this is in a secure behind the the the fence i don't know how they
[3:39:48.700 --> 3:39:51.100]  got this video when it was behind the fence but they went in and got this
[3:39:51.100 --> 3:39:54.940]  video you recognize this or you searched for it right
[3:39:54.940 --> 3:39:57.580]  and what did you find well it's not very hard to find like so many of these
[3:39:57.580 --> 3:40:02.300]  things the truth is actually fairly evident this is an amtrak repair facility
[3:40:02.300 --> 3:40:06.140]  in beach grove indiana the the the woman who made this
[3:40:06.140 --> 3:40:09.740]  video initially claims that it's some kind of american Auschwitz and they've
[3:40:09.740 --> 3:40:13.740]  outfitted buildings with gas and they've got these strange turn styles
[3:40:13.740 --> 3:40:19.180]  in fact it's it is a repair facility we set a crew there the other day and we
[3:40:19.180 --> 3:40:23.580]  got this your video yes so initially they had some old
[3:40:23.580 --> 3:40:27.340]  buildings that were boarded up that have since been knocked down
[3:40:27.340 --> 3:40:31.660]  but we also went inside the the other buildings and sure enough what did we
[3:40:31.660 --> 3:40:37.100]  find they're repairing trains in there well trains i believe Auschwitz had
[3:40:37.100 --> 3:40:40.300]  trains i'm just saying jim well once you go down that road
[3:40:40.300 --> 3:40:44.060]  you can't really if somebody's convinced wants to be convinced to that you
[3:40:44.060 --> 3:40:47.660]  can't really debunk that do we have the video with audio because if we don't i
[3:40:47.660 --> 3:40:51.980]  don't really care the video with the audio okay
[3:40:51.980 --> 3:40:55.740]  that's enough and i know i said we'd open the phones up we have breaking news on
[3:40:55.740 --> 3:40:58.460]  the shooting from new york i may get to some of the calls here that have loaded
[3:40:58.460 --> 3:41:01.660]  the phone lines and tomorrow or someday this will grab nothing but open
[3:41:01.660 --> 3:41:05.980]  phones just there's so much news to cover and we do have jim from new york uh
[3:41:05.980 --> 3:41:09.980]  on we're going to go to him in just a moment with the beamington rampage but
[3:41:09.980 --> 3:41:14.300]  before i do that i did an hour and 40 minute
[3:41:14.300 --> 3:41:18.780]  presentation yesterday but if you take the breaks out it's about a
[3:41:18.780 --> 3:41:23.420]  hour and 20 minute presentation where i go through the history of the fema
[3:41:23.420 --> 3:41:27.420]  camps the troops the militarization of police the government's own documents
[3:41:27.420 --> 3:41:30.460]  rocky mountain news you know about mass graves and
[3:41:30.460 --> 3:41:34.220]  incinerators all the rumors are over you want incinerators proof
[3:41:34.220 --> 3:41:37.740]  you want mass grave proof you want internal government documents
[3:41:37.740 --> 3:41:41.740]  secret documents and public documents we got them
[3:41:41.740 --> 3:41:45.660]  all proven incredibly important news story
[3:41:45.660 --> 3:41:50.300]  all proven and then we counter how he was going to debunk
[3:41:50.300 --> 3:41:54.540]  this was done yesterday live hours before his live tv show we launch
[3:41:54.540 --> 3:41:58.300]  uh folks grabbed it off prison planet dot tv it was posted at the alex jones
[3:41:58.300 --> 3:42:02.300]  channel on youtube and the one two three four five
[3:42:02.300 --> 3:42:08.940]  six seven parts the seven parts are all posted right
[3:42:08.940 --> 3:42:13.260]  now at prison planet dot com and info wars dot com the nsc
[3:42:13.260 --> 3:42:18.860]  military checkpoints and yes glen back fema camps are real
[3:42:18.860 --> 3:42:21.820]  and i go into the whole superstructure of the shadow government works from our
[3:42:21.820 --> 3:42:26.460]  own missions that the that's a decent headline but but but
[3:42:26.460 --> 3:42:30.220]  maybe we should just say you know the the facts on
[3:42:30.220 --> 3:42:35.820]  fema camps yes they are real hour long expose a
[3:42:35.820 --> 3:42:39.980]  get it out to everybody but whatever folks
[3:42:39.980 --> 3:42:45.260]  this can backfire on back in the globalist okay you get this out to people
[3:42:45.260 --> 3:42:49.020]  you get a few million views on this
[3:42:51.180 --> 3:42:55.180]  and you see me on here predicting the footage they would show as a straw man
[3:42:55.180 --> 3:42:58.940]  this can really have a big effect on also the missouri official
[3:42:58.940 --> 3:43:02.140]  who wrote the mic report from adl documents have been forced to resign
[3:43:02.140 --> 3:43:05.180]  they're talking about trying to make the governor step down or recall the
[3:43:05.180 --> 3:43:09.340]  missouri demonizing the patriot movement we're on the march we're not putting up
[3:43:09.340 --> 3:43:15.900]  with the adl's garbage anymore we're not putting up with the
[3:43:15.900 --> 3:43:19.740]  slander they put out or or what the southern poverty law center is doing
[3:43:19.740 --> 3:43:23.420]  we're not putting up with their psychological demonization and macarthe
[3:43:23.420 --> 3:43:28.220]  isn't anymore it's over the gloves are off okay we're gonna expose you
[3:43:28.220 --> 3:43:31.820]  we're not gonna do it from the pathetic buck toothed white supremacist angle
[3:43:31.820 --> 3:43:34.700]  that's fully discredited and has no effect or we're gonna do it as americans
[3:43:34.700 --> 3:43:37.660]  who love liberty black white old young who want to bring down the new world
[3:43:37.660 --> 3:43:41.180]  order and we're gonna do it effectively and we're taking this country back and
[3:43:41.180 --> 3:43:43.900]  we're gonna arrest you the bankers for the crimes you've committed you're not
[3:43:43.900 --> 3:43:46.700]  gonna get your new world order i know the phony churches are paid off to tell
[3:43:46.700 --> 3:43:49.660]  christians to stand down it's the end of the world but we see through those
[3:43:49.660 --> 3:43:53.900]  lies and we're exposing that too we're on the march your empire is going straight
[3:43:53.900 --> 3:43:59.180]  to hades now that said a lot of key stuff up on info wars dot com and prison
[3:43:59.180 --> 3:44:04.140]  planet dot com right now i want to go to jim not his real name we're not going
[3:44:04.140 --> 3:44:07.820]  to say how he works or what he does
[3:44:07.820 --> 3:44:12.220]  in a uh... we're just gonna leave it at that it's it's it's government
[3:44:12.220 --> 3:44:15.740]  and we've confirmed his real name and where he works and what's going on
[3:44:15.740 --> 3:44:21.740]  uh... dealing with the beamington rampage leaving 14 dead including the gunman
[3:44:21.740 --> 3:44:24.540]  turns out he'd written a letter specifically where he was going to go
[3:44:24.540 --> 3:44:27.980]  and who is going to kill you know what he was going to do
[3:44:27.980 --> 3:44:31.980]  and so our witness all we were already hearing from others but he's an eyewitness
[3:44:31.980 --> 3:44:36.300]  to this uh... jim from beamington new york right across the street from all
[3:44:36.300 --> 3:44:41.260]  this happening uh... tell us the amazing story
[3:44:41.260 --> 3:44:45.260]  pretty simple really i was across the street at the time the shooting occurred
[3:44:45.260 --> 3:44:49.660]  in banghamton new york was a sunny day and there was a helicopter overhead
[3:44:49.660 --> 3:44:52.220]  looked like a news one of the news coppers that
[3:44:52.220 --> 3:44:56.300]  does traffic and such uh... area i was standing
[3:44:56.300 --> 3:44:59.180]  was indirectly in front of the high school where
[3:44:59.180 --> 3:45:02.860]  all law-abiding citizens know they're prohibited from carrying any license
[3:45:02.860 --> 3:45:07.820]  firearms so when things weren't right i could do nothing
[3:45:07.820 --> 3:45:11.980]  other than alert people across the street where there's a small police
[3:45:11.980 --> 3:45:14.780]  barracks at the high school that something wasn't right
[3:45:14.780 --> 3:45:19.500]  and as the situation developed multiple shots could be heard from the direction
[3:45:19.500 --> 3:45:24.060]  of the civic center and the local police did respond
[3:45:24.060 --> 3:45:27.420]  but they didn't enter the building as far as i could tell they set up a
[3:45:27.420 --> 3:45:31.660]  perimeter and within minutes they're joined by other police and soon an
[3:45:31.660 --> 3:45:35.580]  armored unit came with shields and such and because it's all about their safety
[3:45:35.580 --> 3:45:39.820]  and i mean 50 years ago the cops would just charge in and kill this guy
[3:45:39.820 --> 3:45:43.740]  but uh... i guess that was back when men were men cars were cars women were women
[3:45:43.740 --> 3:45:47.900]  but uh... you know i mean this is just amazing and so to be clear though before
[3:45:47.900 --> 3:45:51.820]  you hear the shot start you're already concerned there's a news chopper
[3:45:51.820 --> 3:45:55.660]  flying around and it turns out these guys knew where to go they've gotten the
[3:45:55.660 --> 3:46:01.180]  letter this is outrageous and you had to contact the police
[3:46:01.180 --> 3:46:04.540]  the only thing you could do my license firearm was
[3:46:04.540 --> 3:46:08.700]  home locked in a lockbox because i knew i was going to be in uh...
[3:46:08.700 --> 3:46:16.860]  firearm-free zone that day dear god feel very badly of being so helpless
[3:46:16.860 --> 3:46:20.140]  yeah it's just like a susanna up when they gun down her parents and she had
[3:46:20.140 --> 3:46:24.060]  the she had usually carried the firearm but that was illegal here in texas at
[3:46:24.060 --> 3:46:27.100]  the time so she she reached in and the gun wasn't there and he just watched
[3:46:27.100 --> 3:46:29.820]  she just watched them blow her parents away
[3:46:29.820 --> 3:46:33.420]  my god the victim is our okay okay so so let's go to the timeline here's we're
[3:46:33.420 --> 3:46:35.900]  gonna write an article about this but without saying who you are where you
[3:46:35.900 --> 3:46:39.580]  work go through it step by step every little
[3:46:39.580 --> 3:46:43.820]  key point describe how this starts
[3:46:43.820 --> 3:46:48.620]  it started by a man across the street
[3:46:48.620 --> 3:46:54.460]  who also works for the government came across and said he saw an asian man
[3:46:54.460 --> 3:46:58.140]  about five foot eight with a green jacket and sunglasses
[3:46:58.140 --> 3:47:01.420]  appeared to be carrying something and he was
[3:47:01.420 --> 3:47:04.780]  not quite sure what the something was but it frightened him terribly
[3:47:04.780 --> 3:47:10.300]  and he wanted police to help so he went across and
[3:47:10.300 --> 3:47:13.820]  let people know something wasn't right and i went with him
[3:47:13.820 --> 3:47:18.060]  because i couldn't do anything and other than alert
[3:47:18.060 --> 3:47:21.500]  and the soon as the police heard something was going on
[3:47:21.500 --> 3:47:25.020]  someone across the street and some initiated the safety protocol for the
[3:47:25.020 --> 3:47:28.620]  school and they did lockdown as his standard procedure
[3:47:28.620 --> 3:47:31.980]  and they protected the children my hats off the law enforcement they did a
[3:47:31.980 --> 3:47:35.340]  great job with that
[3:47:35.340 --> 3:47:40.220]  and once they set up a perimeter now how people started coming and
[3:47:40.220 --> 3:47:44.380]  no paramedics and such and they wouldn't let anyone into the building
[3:47:44.380 --> 3:47:50.780]  you know to help the injured and went on for hours before they let anyone
[3:47:50.780 --> 3:47:55.340]  enter and help almost turns out he had he had killed himself he killed
[3:47:55.340 --> 3:47:58.780]  yeah he killed himself early on so people bled to death as usual
[3:47:58.780 --> 3:48:02.300]  just like colomba and everywhere else for for many hours
[3:48:02.300 --> 3:48:05.660]  specifically how many hours until they went in and then specifically you're
[3:48:05.660 --> 3:48:09.820]  saying the helicopter was out there first
[3:48:09.820 --> 3:48:13.900]  that's what i remember and it was at least an hour before
[3:48:13.900 --> 3:48:18.300]  any police entered the building that i saw in three before they let health care
[3:48:18.300 --> 3:48:21.020]  people go in
[3:48:22.300 --> 3:48:26.060]  three i mean so they go in and they know he's dead and then they wait two hours
[3:48:26.060 --> 3:48:30.300]  that that is an outrageous crime right there and this is procedure now they're
[3:48:30.300 --> 3:48:34.620]  filling out so much paperwork just like the the coast guard in england now has
[3:48:34.620 --> 3:48:37.580]  to fill out hours of paperwork before they go save somebody in the north
[3:48:37.580 --> 3:48:40.860]  atlantic so they die
[3:48:40.860 --> 3:48:43.580]  gotta wait for the feds gotta wait for procedure gotta wait for homeland
[3:48:43.580 --> 3:48:45.900]  security gotta wait to wipe our noses
[3:48:45.900 --> 3:48:50.300]  i mean can you imagine the ut sniper back in the 60s the cops just ran up the
[3:48:50.300 --> 3:48:53.980]  stairs and killed the guy you know nowadays they'd wait and god probably
[3:48:53.980 --> 3:48:56.940]  still be up there you probably have big gray beard still be shooting up there
[3:48:56.940 --> 3:48:59.660]  and they'd be sending baskets of sandwiches up to him
[3:48:59.660 --> 3:49:02.860]  uh... i hate to be sarcastic but specifically
[3:49:02.860 --> 3:49:06.540]  okay i mean go through the chronology because this is important
[3:49:06.540 --> 3:49:09.820]  uh... the the the the fellow comes over says i'm concerned
[3:49:09.820 --> 3:49:14.460]  after the helicopter or i mean go to that timeline this is very important
[3:49:14.460 --> 3:49:18.140]  i noticed the helicopter over the neighborhood when i was walking across
[3:49:18.140 --> 3:49:20.860]  the front of the building fella came over
[3:49:20.860 --> 3:49:24.860]  voicing concern across the street then uh...
[3:49:24.860 --> 3:49:28.700]  and they notified the police that were on site they responded in under two
[3:49:28.700 --> 3:49:31.820]  minutes they went across to the front of the building confirmed
[3:49:31.820 --> 3:49:35.260]  you know that there were gunshots you can hear
[3:49:35.260 --> 3:49:39.740]  multiple gunshots then they backed off and they set up a perimeter
[3:49:39.740 --> 3:49:43.900]  and then help came and then let me be clear
[3:49:43.900 --> 3:49:48.060]  what was the helicopter out there first before you heard the gunshot start
[3:49:48.060 --> 3:49:53.420]  i believe so oh my god might have just been flying around looking at traffic
[3:49:53.420 --> 3:49:57.420]  who knows what they do but and of course you talk to somebody who had just
[3:49:57.420 --> 3:50:01.340]  seen him with the what looks suspicious going in
[3:50:01.340 --> 3:50:05.180]  so this is all happening and right then the helicopter is already there
[3:50:05.180 --> 3:50:08.140]  there's there at least a couple of minutes before
[3:50:08.140 --> 3:50:14.380]  anybody uh... this is unbelievable the news media
[3:50:14.380 --> 3:50:20.220]  got this letter from this guy and then it looks like waited and just let it
[3:50:20.220 --> 3:50:23.740]  happen
[3:50:23.740 --> 3:50:28.300]  what do you think is going on sir i have no idea but something's not right in
[3:50:28.300 --> 3:50:32.620]  the world i wish i had answers i'm still in
[3:50:32.620 --> 3:50:36.780]  shock well it's like Columbine half the school is empty
[3:50:36.780 --> 3:50:40.700]  vexing more than half the Harrison Clybalt's puzzle snuck in 120 something
[3:50:40.700 --> 3:50:44.940]  bombs one of them weighing over 100 pounds no one stopped them doing that
[3:50:44.940 --> 3:50:49.660]  uh... the principal the deputy principal and the sheriff all having lunch down
[3:50:49.660 --> 3:50:53.340]  the street uh... the kids reported other
[3:50:53.340 --> 3:50:55.980]  shooters in the building and and the police stood down for
[3:50:55.980 --> 3:50:59.580]  four hours 30 minutes according to the denver post
[3:50:59.580 --> 3:51:02.940]  stay there jim i want to come back with final comments from you silver is
[3:51:02.940 --> 3:51:07.500]  mankind's oldest natural antibiotic this very special mineral has been used
[3:51:07.500 --> 3:51:11.100]  for centuries by most cultures throughout the world utopia texas
[3:51:11.100 --> 3:51:14.220]  is home to a small but mighty supplement company called
[3:51:14.220 --> 3:51:18.140]  utopia silver who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water
