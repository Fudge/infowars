[00:00.000 --> 00:28.520]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:28.520 --> 00:32.920]  Aman Jabi has worked in Silicon Valley for 28 years.
[00:32.920 --> 00:38.800]  His background includes work on deep technologies that are involved in the new digital prison
[00:38.800 --> 00:42.120]  system being designed by Big Tech.
[00:42.120 --> 00:47.400]  In 2020, he moved to Montana and became a whistleblower, warning the public of the
[00:47.400 --> 00:54.040]  very real threat about to be unleashed upon us all, known by many as the Mark of the Beast
[00:54.040 --> 00:55.040]  System.
[00:55.040 --> 01:00.960]  Aman explains how accepting the digital ID is the basic premise behind it all.
[01:00.960 --> 01:08.320]  So by default, a digital identity implies that you are always in a digital prison.
[01:08.320 --> 01:14.680]  Since you have a digital identity and you're in a prison, you are by default a criminal.
[01:14.680 --> 01:16.400]  So we don't trust you.
[01:16.400 --> 01:22.280]  Just like the old system, this new one is also voluntary and you are supposed to know
[01:22.280 --> 01:26.400]  that it's a digital prison that you are voluntarily signing up for.
[01:26.400 --> 01:32.840]  And the reason for this is because in this new system, having a digital ID will be proof
[01:32.840 --> 01:34.680]  that you are a criminal.
[01:34.680 --> 01:39.200]  Because having a digital ID means that you are in a digital prison.
[01:39.200 --> 01:43.240]  And because you accepted it, you must be a criminal.
[01:43.240 --> 01:48.720]  Because of this, there is a new protocol being introduced with this system, known as Zero
[01:48.720 --> 01:49.720]  Trust.
[01:49.720 --> 01:52.440]  How is Zero Trust going to be used?
[01:52.440 --> 01:56.040]  Here's a lady she wants to go and buy some beef.
[01:56.040 --> 02:01.960]  But let's say her carbon footprint or her beef footprint for the month has been exceeded.
[02:01.960 --> 02:03.680]  That door won't open.
[02:03.680 --> 02:06.840]  This digital prison is sneaking up on us all.
[02:06.840 --> 02:13.040]  There is no need for an implanted chip, because everything is being done with facial recognition,
[02:13.040 --> 02:16.520]  which is already plugged into the entire system.
[02:16.520 --> 02:22.200]  America already has more cameras per capita than Communist China, and our social credit
[02:22.200 --> 02:25.320]  score is already being logged.
[02:25.320 --> 02:31.200]  All we need at this point is a series of events that lead us all into having to make the choice
[02:31.200 --> 02:36.600]  of either accepting the new digital ID or saying no.
[02:36.600 --> 02:42.760]  Since the COVID lockdowns, new state-of-the-art LED lights have been replacing street lights
[02:42.760 --> 02:45.160]  in cities throughout the West.
[02:45.160 --> 02:48.760]  Amon explains that this is all part of the plan.
[02:48.760 --> 02:53.960]  These lights will be connected to everything, including your phone and your car.
[02:53.960 --> 03:01.000]  And in new cars, that includes 16 different cameras with LiDAR and Sonar.
[03:01.000 --> 03:07.100]  These lights are being outfitted with LED incapacitators, which is a light technology
[03:07.100 --> 03:12.640]  that was first announced 15 years ago, back when it caused enough brain damage to make
[03:12.640 --> 03:14.640]  a person sick.
[03:14.640 --> 03:18.760]  Another strange weapon in the final stages of development is able to mount an all-out
[03:18.760 --> 03:21.240]  barrage on the optic nerve.
[03:21.240 --> 03:25.280]  The LED incapacitator was developed under the auspices of the Department of Homeland
[03:25.280 --> 03:31.480]  Security for the purposes of creating what we call a non-lethal defense system.
[03:31.480 --> 03:38.240]  And this technology consists of a bright set of LED technology light-emitting diodes that
[03:38.240 --> 03:45.800]  is designed to create sort of temporary blindness, meaning temporary ability to not be able to
[03:45.800 --> 03:49.520]  see the person who we're trying to protect.
[03:49.520 --> 03:53.560]  If aggressors caught in its bright pulsating glare don't shield their eyes or turn away
[03:53.560 --> 03:59.160]  quick enough, temporary blindness isn't the only effect they'll feel.
[03:59.160 --> 04:04.240]  The first time I saw the LED, I was in a darkened room and within three or four seconds, I had
[04:04.240 --> 04:09.520]  to reach forward and grab the hold of a lab bench because I was feeling a little bit dizzy
[04:09.520 --> 04:11.020]  or disoriented.
[04:11.020 --> 04:15.880]  The device's combination of different colors and random flashes can induce psychophysical
[04:15.880 --> 04:19.200]  effects, including vertigo and possible nausea.
[04:19.200 --> 04:21.800]  It's been nicknamed the puke light.
[04:21.800 --> 04:27.920]  It's been 15 years and our Silicon Valley whistleblower believes that this technology
[04:27.920 --> 04:30.640]  is now capable of killing people.
[04:30.640 --> 04:33.480]  Ultimately, we can say no to this.
[04:33.480 --> 04:37.960]  But if there's a critical mass that doesn't sign on to the digital ID, then this agenda
[04:37.960 --> 04:40.160]  gets weakened substantially.
[04:40.160 --> 04:44.240]  But we will have to first unify and come together.
[04:44.240 --> 04:46.920]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[04:46.920 --> 05:06.200]  I want you to remember two words, Infowars Platinum.
[05:06.200 --> 05:12.040]  In the history of Infowars supplements, and they're amazing, this is hands down the most
[05:12.040 --> 05:16.200]  powerful game changing products we've ever offered to the public.
[05:16.200 --> 05:20.760]  Now all three of these are private labels of three national bestsellers put out by a
[05:20.760 --> 05:24.960]  pharmaceutical company that also makes high end supplements, and the owner's a listener
[05:24.960 --> 05:25.960]  and a supporter.
[05:25.960 --> 05:31.760]  So they're giving them to us at 40% off what they're sold on stores, over 20% off what
[05:31.760 --> 05:36.440]  they're sold online under the Infowars Platinum brand name.
[05:36.440 --> 05:37.440]  These are incredible.
[05:37.440 --> 05:43.960]  Pain MD, HGH Max Boost, and of course 1776 testosterone boost.
[05:43.960 --> 05:48.640]  Read about them at InfowarsStore.com, learn about them, and then try them out for yourself.
[05:48.640 --> 05:51.880]  And I know you will be a repeat customer, which is awesome.
[05:51.880 --> 05:56.000]  It will empower your life, make your life more amazing, and it will keep us on the air
[05:56.000 --> 05:57.000]  a 360 win.
[05:57.000 --> 06:11.520]  Infowars Platinum, now available at InfowarsStore.com.
[06:11.520 --> 06:20.400]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[06:20.400 --> 06:24.640]  Welcome to Wednesday, December 28, 2022.
[06:24.640 --> 06:29.480]  Powerful forces of the global esteemed state have been battling around the clock for many
[06:29.480 --> 06:33.040]  years to take us off the air, but thanks for you, the viewers and listeners.
[06:33.040 --> 06:35.760]  Your word of mouth, your prayer, and your support.
[06:35.760 --> 06:42.840]  We are still on air in many ways, though scarred stronger than ever with more resolve than ever.
[06:42.840 --> 06:45.440]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[06:45.440 --> 06:50.840]  Okay, we're going to open the phones up throughout the four hours of the transmission.
[06:50.840 --> 06:55.160]  We have a very special guest popping in in the third hour, but the first and second hour
[06:55.160 --> 07:00.960]  and into the fourth, I'll be taking calls today on any issue you wish to discuss.
[07:00.960 --> 07:05.160]  It'll be a wild card free for all here, but obviously I'm going to throw out a lot of
[07:05.160 --> 07:09.160]  topics and news that I want to get to.
[07:09.160 --> 07:16.320]  Over two years ago, whistleblowers, including Dr. Huff, who was the vice president of EcoHealth
[07:16.320 --> 07:22.520]  Alliance and the head of their operations, their science division, which is their main
[07:22.520 --> 07:30.920]  division, chief scientist, senior scientist, went public with internal emails going back
[07:30.920 --> 07:41.000]  years before COVID-19 was released out of a lab in late 2019 in China and detailed how
[07:41.000 --> 07:49.400]  they were developing gain of function specifically with coronaviruses and other viruses being
[07:49.400 --> 07:50.400]  mixed together.
[07:50.400 --> 07:58.240]  And they specifically even named one COVID-19 in 2018.
[07:58.240 --> 08:05.200]  They already produced the mRNA sequences for the gene therapy, so-called vaccine, by
[08:05.200 --> 08:07.200]  2018.
[08:07.200 --> 08:09.320]  This is all public.
[08:09.320 --> 08:13.280]  So I thought instead of just reminding you this came out a few years ago, I'd actually
[08:13.280 --> 08:15.640]  print some of the original articles.
[08:15.640 --> 08:19.240]  Here's one from September 9th, 2021.
[08:19.240 --> 08:23.480]  This came out a long time after we broke it with Dr. Boyle and the different whistleblowers
[08:23.480 --> 08:31.920]  and attorney, Tom Renz, Fauci was untruthful to Congress about will on lab research.
[08:31.920 --> 08:34.600]  New documents appear to show.
[08:34.600 --> 08:40.880]  And that's from the board of governors, professor of chemistry, biology, Rutgers University,
[08:40.880 --> 08:48.960]  and others with the emails, but they're talking in 2018, 2019 about gain of function under
[08:48.960 --> 08:52.080]  the directive of the NIH and Fauci.
[08:52.080 --> 08:56.680]  Now, there's a federal watchdog agency that supposedly controls this.
[08:56.680 --> 09:00.240]  The problem is Fauci's wife has run it for two decades.
[09:00.240 --> 09:02.640]  I'm going to show you that in a minute.
[09:02.640 --> 09:07.800]  So I thought we'd just do a little reminder, just one little piece of literally thousands,
[09:07.800 --> 09:20.080]  because now, last week, via foyer operations, more documents have come out from DARPA that
[09:20.080 --> 09:26.200]  they were specifically working with Fauci on weaponizing and souping up how deadly viruses
[09:26.200 --> 09:31.080]  were and also, of course, how communicable or how fast they could be spread.
[09:31.080 --> 09:36.360]  And here's a video with attorney Tom Renz talking about the latest and boy, when he
[09:36.360 --> 09:39.160]  said over two years ago, he had all these big whistleblowers, but didn't release their
[09:39.160 --> 09:40.160]  names yet.
[09:40.160 --> 09:47.000]  He told the truth, a whole raft of top insiders, here it is.
[09:47.000 --> 09:57.400]  Three of the people are dying in massive numbers, 6.5 million, 6.5 million globally.
[09:57.400 --> 09:59.240]  That's criminal charges.
[09:59.240 --> 10:02.920]  Did Anthony Fauci lie about gain of function work?
[10:02.920 --> 10:06.000]  Absolutely, in my opinion, he did.
[10:06.000 --> 10:08.160]  And how about criminal charges?
[10:08.160 --> 10:12.640]  We're going to go after Bannon for contempt because he didn't bother to show up to far
[10:12.640 --> 10:19.560]  steering, but we're going to let Fauci lie to Congress about something that is consequential
[10:19.560 --> 10:22.640]  enough to result in 6 million deaths.
[10:22.640 --> 10:24.920]  Can anyone explain this to me?
[10:24.920 --> 10:28.320]  We the people of the United States should be outraged.
[10:28.320 --> 10:32.000]  Instead of pitting a war against people who are Christians, people who believe in the
[10:32.000 --> 10:36.960]  United States, people who want our country to succeed, maybe we should look at the people
[10:36.960 --> 10:42.600]  who are responsible for one of the greatest pandemics in human history and who have resulted
[10:42.600 --> 10:44.600]  in millions of deaths worldwide.
[10:44.600 --> 10:53.000]  I pray that every country in the world, every country, send it to the US, ask us, when are
[10:53.000 --> 10:54.560]  we going to investigate the crooks?
[10:54.560 --> 11:01.880]  The US government didn't do this, but there were people in the US government who did.
[11:01.880 --> 11:06.600]  There are criminals involved who I believe were responsible for this, who were negligent
[11:06.600 --> 11:07.600]  in their work.
[11:07.600 --> 11:08.600]  They did it.
[11:08.600 --> 11:14.680]  The Chinese Communist Party was involved in this, Anthony Fauci appears to be involved
[11:14.680 --> 11:17.920]  in this, Peter Dasek appears to be involved in this.
[11:17.920 --> 11:18.920]  Let's hold him accountable.
[11:18.920 --> 11:24.600]  It's time for criminal charges, criminal investigations, jail, here we go.
[11:24.600 --> 11:29.600]  Is this the same Peter Dasek they sent to investigate the Brown Lake?
[11:29.600 --> 11:36.520]  Yes, this is Peter Dasek who was out there, we sent him to China to decide whether or
[11:36.520 --> 11:41.400]  not this was a lab leak or natural origin, Peter Dasek whose company built this in the
[11:41.400 --> 11:49.440]  lab with the Chinese Communist Party in Wuhan, China was sent to China to investigate himself.
[11:49.440 --> 11:56.680]  Just like in Arizona, the lady over the elections created ballots that violated law for all
[11:56.680 --> 12:01.080]  the major Republican precincts in places like Maricopa County so that the ballots got
[12:01.080 --> 12:07.320]  sped out and didn't work and she just oversaw her own election investigation and of course
[12:07.320 --> 12:08.320]  Kerry Lake lost.
[12:08.320 --> 12:13.160]  Yeah, and I'm a Chinese jet pilot from the moon.
[12:13.160 --> 12:17.160]  So we've got more on this coming out, but whether you are in Europe or whether you're
[12:17.160 --> 12:21.280]  in Australia, New Zealand, the US, Canada, it's all the same.
[12:21.280 --> 12:22.280]  We're being depopulated.
[12:22.280 --> 12:25.760]  Those are the countries that we see the mass death and it's not six million, it's more
[12:25.760 --> 12:27.080]  like 20 million.
[12:27.080 --> 12:36.920]  I personally know five people that died after taking the shot, personally, I know you all
[12:36.920 --> 12:37.920]  do as well.
[12:37.920 --> 12:42.000]  We can open the phones up right now, take 100 phone calls, one after the other with
[12:42.000 --> 12:45.360]  the horror stories and those aren't just anecdotal stories.
[12:45.360 --> 12:52.880]  We have the actual actuary numbers from the insurance companies and governments in places
[12:52.880 --> 13:00.120]  like Israel, places like Singapore, places like Australia, New Zealand, the EU, the European
[13:00.120 --> 13:08.560]  Union system, the UK, Canada, the US, the numbers all are between 11 and 16, sometimes
[13:08.560 --> 13:13.360]  as high as 18 percent increase in deaths year after year.
[13:13.360 --> 13:18.960]  World War II was a 3 percent increase in deaths, World War I was a 5 percent increase
[13:18.960 --> 13:19.960]  in deaths.
[13:19.960 --> 13:24.520]  Do you have any understanding, ladies and gentlemen, that those were the previous records
[13:24.520 --> 13:28.440]  for increased deaths?
[13:28.440 --> 13:29.880]  That never happens.
[13:29.880 --> 13:34.840]  This is the biggest death rate ever seen, 20 million is a conservative number.
[13:34.840 --> 13:39.240]  Attorney Renz is being very ultra conservative with six million.
[13:39.240 --> 13:41.680]  This is the reality that we're facing, ladies and gentlemen.
[13:41.680 --> 13:49.240]  The global average is a 13 percent increase in death in the nations that took these shots.
[13:49.240 --> 13:56.680]  Russia and Russia took classic vaccines which were attenuated dead versions of the COVID
[13:56.680 --> 14:01.720]  virus and they didn't have any of these problems.
[14:01.720 --> 14:02.720]  They're not taking it.
[14:02.720 --> 14:06.720]  Only the West is taking it because we're being bombed with these weapons.
[14:06.720 --> 14:10.680]  Now, when we come back, I'm going to play a clip out of Australia.
[14:10.680 --> 14:15.840]  We played a clip out of New Zealand with their head of their national secret service saying,
[14:15.840 --> 14:19.440]  for anyone questioning the shots or lockdowns, they may be terrorists.
[14:19.440 --> 14:23.840]  Well, now Australia has come out and made the same type of announcement.
[14:23.840 --> 14:25.160]  We're going to play that clip.
[14:25.160 --> 14:30.040]  And then the New York mayor has said, you can't make up these type of quotes here, ladies
[14:30.040 --> 14:31.680]  and gentlemen.
[14:31.680 --> 14:33.920]  Big brother is protecting you.
[14:33.920 --> 14:35.720]  Get used to it.
[14:35.720 --> 14:40.320]  So people say, man, this is like 1984 or something.
[14:40.320 --> 14:47.480]  It's textbook, dystopic, over-the-top tyranny, exactly.
[14:47.480 --> 14:48.960]  Liberty is rare.
[14:48.960 --> 14:49.960]  Tyranny is common.
[14:49.960 --> 14:56.240]  Now, I will say in world history, tyrannies this thoroughbred, this sci-fi have never
[14:56.240 --> 14:59.480]  been seen before because we've got all this technology now.
[14:59.480 --> 15:03.960]  So when we say liberty is super rare and tyranny is super common, that's true.
[15:03.960 --> 15:05.520]  But let's explain something.
[15:05.520 --> 15:12.320]  This level of tyranny and we're seeing unfold has never been seen before other than predicted
[15:12.320 --> 15:18.440]  in the book of Revelation, which you might want to pay attention to, and Daniel and Ezekiel.
[15:18.440 --> 15:21.760]  So it just gives me chills up and down my back.
[15:21.760 --> 15:26.640]  And boy, that New Gregory's report is so over-the-top important, it'll probably only get 500,000
[15:26.640 --> 15:27.640]  views.
[15:27.640 --> 15:28.920]  We're going to beat the New World Order, folks.
[15:28.920 --> 15:31.480]  We need to get 20 million views on that sucker.
[15:31.480 --> 15:33.520]  It's so powerful.
[15:33.520 --> 15:36.240]  A digital prison is being built around you right now.
[15:36.240 --> 15:37.240]  Yes, it is.
[15:37.240 --> 15:42.600]  And finally, folks are waking up to the lockdown of the cities under climate lockdowns, what
[15:42.600 --> 15:46.240]  they're calling 15-minute cities, getting a lot of attention now.
[15:46.240 --> 15:49.440]  I first covered it in my seminal film, Endgame, in 2007.
[15:49.440 --> 15:53.880]  But now they've gone operational, got a big stack on that today and a bunch of video clips
[15:53.880 --> 15:54.880]  as well.
[15:54.880 --> 16:00.960]  Your phone calls and a special guest, so much more, straight ahead.
[16:00.960 --> 16:04.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now launching the most powerful supplements in the history
[16:04.840 --> 16:10.000]  of InfoWars under a new brand name, InfoWars Platinum.
[16:10.000 --> 16:14.720]  Now all three of these revolutionary products you see in front of you are already number
[16:14.720 --> 16:19.760]  one bestsellers in the market for the last few years because they work so well.
[16:19.760 --> 16:23.760]  We've gone right to the manufacturer, who are listeners, the owners of fan, and they've
[16:23.760 --> 16:29.680]  given us this huge deal off of retail, 40% off what these products are found for under
[16:29.680 --> 16:31.760]  other names.
[16:31.760 --> 16:36.560]  And not just under one name, they sell these under three or four other brands that other
[16:36.560 --> 16:38.760]  major distributors and suppliers have put out.
[16:38.760 --> 16:43.320]  The difference is, we have it for 40% off what it is in stores.
[16:43.320 --> 16:45.200]  We're talking about Payne MD.
[16:45.200 --> 16:47.880]  We're talking about HGH Max Boost.
[16:47.880 --> 16:50.760]  We're talking about 1776 testosterone boost.
[16:50.760 --> 16:52.360]  These things are incredible.
[16:52.360 --> 16:56.440]  I would suggest you take half a dose or less when you first do and consult your healthcare
[16:56.440 --> 17:00.600]  provider because they're so powerful, get them at InfoWarsStore.com.
[17:00.600 --> 17:07.680]  Introducing InfoWars Super High End Supplement Line at up to 50% off what the same formulas
[17:07.680 --> 17:10.040]  are sold for in stores.
[17:10.040 --> 17:14.320]  It's InfoWars MD, exclusively available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[17:14.320 --> 17:21.000]  We have a new line of super quality CBD oils that are incredibly good for your entire body
[17:21.000 --> 17:22.880]  at InfoWarsStore.com.

[17:50.320 --> 17:53.480]  you're going to find them in stores and other online stores.
[17:53.480 --> 18:00.880]  This is our new InfoWars MD, Incredible Line.
[18:00.880 --> 18:06.680]  Why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing InfoWars, attacking myself and
[18:06.680 --> 18:08.720]  the crew and our other hosts?
[18:08.720 --> 18:10.560]  Because they know we're pro-human.
[18:10.560 --> 18:12.280]  They know we're telling the truth.
[18:12.280 --> 18:13.840]  They know we've got their number.
[18:13.840 --> 18:18.600]  They know everything we do is about empowering humanity.
[18:18.600 --> 18:23.480]  And God gave us, through Mother Nature, incredible compounds that will supercharge our body's
[18:23.480 --> 18:26.440]  stamina, libido, energy, and immune systems.
[18:26.440 --> 18:32.480]  And we came out many years ago with Real Red Pill Plus that has all the documented compounds
[18:32.480 --> 18:41.160]  like preglonone and so much more to supercharge your body and to give your body the key elements
[18:41.160 --> 18:45.120]  and the key ingredients it needs to function at a proper level.
[18:45.120 --> 18:48.120]  This is the answer to the New World Order's tyranny.
[18:48.120 --> 18:56.520]  This is Real Red Pill Plus sold out for two years, 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[18:56.520 --> 19:00.720]  Get the Red Pill Plus exclusively, infowarstore.com.
[19:00.720 --> 19:03.280]  It's a post-COVID world now.
[19:03.280 --> 19:07.040]  Americans have lost trust in their doctors and the healthcare system.
[19:07.040 --> 19:08.280]  There's a solution.
[19:08.280 --> 19:09.280]  The Wellness Company.
[19:09.280 --> 19:12.560]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and I'm the Chief Scientific Officer.
[19:12.560 --> 19:18.640]  And I can tell you firsthand that these verticals of uncensored content, virtual appointments,
[19:18.640 --> 19:24.400]  doctors on demand, prescriptions through a network of community pharmacies, in home,
[19:24.400 --> 19:31.080]  in vitro diagnostics, laboratory testing, imaging, an online set of holistic products
[19:31.080 --> 19:37.840]  can help guide you for your usual general medical care, but also COVID-19, acute and
[19:37.840 --> 19:43.960]  post-COVID syndromes, vaccine injury syndromes, and the array of things that now America has
[19:43.960 --> 19:48.560]  to work through in this new world that we're living in.
[19:48.560 --> 19:55.320]  So go to onlinehealthnow.com and check out the Wellness Company for a low monthly fee.
[19:55.320 --> 20:07.760]  You can get started today and on a pathway to better health.
[03:44.180 --> 20:39.320]  just incredible to read all the different globalist public statements and
[20:39.320 --> 20:44.160]  documents and leak documents and to actually see them doing it all.
[20:44.160 --> 20:48.520]  We're at that critical juncture where they're emerging and their whole project is coming
[20:48.520 --> 20:51.720]  out in the open and it is so diabolical.
[20:51.720 --> 20:55.000]  It is so over the top tyrannical.
[20:55.000 --> 20:57.160]  It is ridiculous.
[20:57.160 --> 21:02.040]  And we've got a domesticated population in the West that's had it so good, so long that
[21:02.040 --> 21:04.800]  people have no idea what's hitting them.
[21:04.800 --> 21:11.560]  And by the time they've got their casual society in, by the time they've got their programs
[21:11.560 --> 21:20.000]  of programmable currencies in place, it is going to be so hellish in their own admissions.
[21:20.000 --> 21:26.320]  Here's an example, in my film Endgame made in 2007, I explained how they're going to
[21:26.320 --> 21:33.440]  lock down the cities, not let cars inside the cities and track everywhere you go and
[21:33.440 --> 21:38.400]  then jack up taxes on everybody outside the cities and cut resources off to the rural
[21:38.400 --> 21:43.840]  areas as well and how they describe how they're going to send these paramilitary environmentalist
[21:43.840 --> 21:50.000]  forces into the rural areas to literally take your farms and nationalize them under corporate
[21:50.000 --> 21:52.280]  control, fascism.
[21:52.280 --> 21:56.560]  And now if you look at Europe and Australia and everywhere, they're doing it, Canada.
[21:56.560 --> 22:04.520]  And now they're announcing in here it is so criminal beyond belief and the public isn't
[22:04.520 --> 22:12.560]  expecting to get hit by something like this because people still think they're in Kansas,
[22:12.560 --> 22:20.480]  like they say in the Wizard of Oz, you're not in Kansas anymore.
[22:20.480 --> 22:25.880]  And all the tactics of tyrants with a high-tech overlay are being implemented now and that's
[22:25.880 --> 22:27.680]  my greatest frustration.
[22:27.680 --> 22:30.680]  I woke up at like 3 a.m. in the middle of the night last night, got up, got a glass
[22:30.680 --> 22:34.760]  of water, shook my head and I went in and looked at my five-year-old daughter sleeping
[22:34.760 --> 22:41.480]  and I just thought, how can the establishment be doing this?
[22:41.480 --> 22:44.600]  How can they be targeting children?
[22:44.600 --> 22:50.600]  How can they be trying to give newborn babies poison shots and six months up or being given
[22:50.600 --> 22:51.600]  them?
[22:51.600 --> 22:57.360]  And it really comes down to this, the globalist hate humanity.
[22:57.360 --> 23:02.240]  They hate you and they see you as a useless eater, they see you as bugs in their pantry
[23:02.240 --> 23:09.720]  eating their food and they want you gone and they want you to accept this topia and the
[23:09.720 --> 23:14.480]  whole process of what they tell their minions will be the end of the world by 2030, the
[23:14.480 --> 23:18.720]  end of the world as we know it and then you'll own nothing and have nothing.
[23:18.720 --> 23:24.480]  And that's why they're different minions from Greta Thunberg to AOC, to Beto, to all
[23:24.480 --> 23:29.760]  of them tell you it'll be the end of the world by 2030.
[23:29.760 --> 23:33.720]  When they say the end of the world, they mean the end of the world as we know it, hell on
[23:33.720 --> 23:42.320]  earth and they're implementing it and they are telling you, they are telling us that
[23:42.320 --> 23:46.600]  we deserve it and it's our fault that viruses are about to come out of the jungle and kill
[23:46.600 --> 23:47.600]  us all.
[23:47.600 --> 23:52.680]  And it's our fault that there's no energy and the power's going off and it's our fault
[23:52.680 --> 23:56.880]  that's fettin' all over the streets but it's not our fault, it's their fault, they are
[23:56.880 --> 24:01.400]  implementing it and they're directing against us but there is a sliver of truth there, there's
[24:01.400 --> 24:02.880]  a kernel of truth there.
[24:02.880 --> 24:07.600]  It is our fault in the final equation if we sit here and we let these people do this.
[24:07.600 --> 24:11.760]  So here's what I'm going to do, I'm going to open the phones up on any issue, any topic
[24:11.760 --> 24:16.080]  you want to cover but only for first time callers today.
[24:16.080 --> 24:22.560]  So first time callers get a chance to get on the air with us and we're going to cover
[24:22.560 --> 24:25.000]  all of these issues together.
[24:25.000 --> 24:28.000]  I'll give the number out in a moment, here are some of the other big topics that I'm
[24:28.000 --> 24:32.200]  going to be drilling into in great detail.
[24:32.200 --> 24:36.200]  The latest on the COVID attack and how it's all coming out that was premeditated and gained
[24:36.200 --> 24:42.120]  a function and the police state response not just in cyberspace but on the ground to try
[24:42.120 --> 24:46.760]  to bully and outlaw and criminalize, questioning their attack because we're beating them in
[24:46.760 --> 24:50.200]  the information war with the truth.
[24:50.200 --> 24:54.120]  Then we've got a window into what the world's going to look like as the resources are cut
[24:54.120 --> 25:02.120]  off with what happened in Japan when they had their Chernobyl, their Fukushima event
[25:02.120 --> 25:12.120]  and crime that's already the lowest in the world in Japan went to zero recorded for more
[25:12.120 --> 25:17.960]  than six months after that disaster, the Japanese people came together.
[25:17.960 --> 25:23.200]  They're fine people, too bad they're having 1.2 children and will be extinct another hundred
[25:23.200 --> 25:26.320]  years or so it's estimated.
[25:26.320 --> 25:31.360]  But if you look at what's happened in the United States or Europe now, once there is
[25:31.360 --> 25:39.320]  a crisis like the massive amounts of deaths and crises and 10 feet of snow in New York
[25:39.320 --> 25:46.440]  state, what do you see there looting and crime and murder?
[25:46.440 --> 25:56.720]  Now I'm not saying the American people in general are bad people but a culture of crime
[25:56.720 --> 26:05.240]  and criminality has been promoted and has been protected by the Democratic Party in particular
[26:05.240 --> 26:11.760]  that has normalized class warfare but it's not class warfare to go rob somebody's house
[26:11.760 --> 26:20.520]  or some family owned convenience store, it is divide and conquer designed to bring down
[26:20.520 --> 26:23.760]  civilization.
[26:23.760 --> 26:33.000]  And we have a media that exacerbates every crisis we've got for more control.
[26:33.000 --> 26:40.680]  So I mentioned earlier when we go to this clip or several clips of the attempt to bully
[26:40.680 --> 26:47.040]  and outlaw through cyberspace, not just the general public but scientists and doctors
[26:47.040 --> 26:53.000]  and nurses and witnesses to what really happened with COVID, its origins, the suppression of
[26:53.000 --> 26:59.640]  therapeutics, what the deadly shots really do and now whether you're in Germany or whether
[26:59.640 --> 27:04.000]  you're in New Zealand or Australia or Italy, they're the vanguard of the tyranny or the
[27:04.000 --> 27:09.080]  UK, they have public quote health officials and others in the heads of intelligence agencies
[27:09.080 --> 27:15.640]  and police departments on TV saying if you question what we're doing when they're known
[27:15.640 --> 27:23.880]  liars, why you're a terrorist and should be reported, the full videos on infowars.com,
[27:23.880 --> 27:27.800]  it's a police chief to rat out anti-government, anti-police or COVID vaccine conspiracy
[27:27.800 --> 27:28.800]  terrorists.
[27:28.800 --> 27:35.880]  That's right, this is in Brisbane, here's the police chief, hear it for yourself.
[27:35.880 --> 27:41.320]  We've got other specialist teams involved like our COVID online team, evidence extraction
[27:41.320 --> 27:45.360]  experts, our forensic police.
[27:45.360 --> 27:51.840]  We also have involved our security and counter-terrorism teams and the reason that they're involved
[27:51.840 --> 27:59.520]  is that they are skilled at looking at motivation between, motivation of why people do things
[27:59.520 --> 28:01.960]  like we saw last Monday.
[28:01.960 --> 28:06.240]  So they're skilled at looking at things like religiously motivated extremism, ideological
[28:06.240 --> 28:13.120]  motivated extremism, issue motivated extremism, grievance, fueled violence and even pathological
[28:13.120 --> 28:15.480]  fuel violence.
[28:15.480 --> 28:19.640]  So they're assisting the investigation centre and the ethical standards command.
[28:19.640 --> 28:24.440]  Are you broadly concerned, I guess after seeing something like this, the attack on
[28:24.440 --> 28:31.160]  police and the rise in conspiracy theorists, is that something that police are concerned
[28:31.160 --> 28:32.160]  about?
[28:32.160 --> 28:33.160]  Of course, of course.
[28:33.160 --> 28:39.000]  Right across the country, I mean, part of my role is in counter-terrorism and we meet
[28:39.000 --> 28:43.520]  nationally with the Australian New Zealand Counter-Terrorism Committee and discuss these
[28:43.520 --> 28:45.120]  issues regularly.
[28:45.120 --> 28:52.200]  So we do investigate and monitor people who demonstrate and we know show concerning behaviour.
[28:52.200 --> 28:55.520]  Look, that hasn't been reported to me, but that's not uncommon.
[28:55.520 --> 28:58.880]  Hold on, there's more coming up, we'll finish the clip when we come back.
[28:58.880 --> 29:07.160]  I want you to remember two words, info wars platinum in the history of info war supplements
[29:07.160 --> 29:08.920]  and they're amazing.
[29:08.920 --> 29:15.000]  This is hands down the most powerful game-changing products we've ever offered to the public.
[29:15.000 --> 29:19.520]  Now all three of these are private labels of three national bestsellers put out by a
[29:19.520 --> 29:23.840]  pharmaceutical company that also makes high-end supplements and the owner's a listener and
[29:23.840 --> 29:24.840]  a supporter.
[29:24.840 --> 29:30.520]  So they're giving them to us at 40% off what they're sold on stores, over 20% off what
[29:30.520 --> 29:35.200]  they're sold online under the info wars platinum brand name.

[33:17.320 --> 33:21.480]  so here's a major australian police chief saying she works for the federal government
[33:21.480 --> 33:27.400]  to track people criticising the shots and lockdowns as terrorists this is the same message across
[33:27.400 --> 33:44.400]  the western world this is tyranny of course of course right across the country I mean
[33:44.400 --> 33:50.640]  my part of my role is in counterterrorism and we meet nationally with the australian
[33:50.640 --> 33:57.440]  New Zealand counterterrorism committee and discuss these issues regularly so we do investigate
[33:57.440 --> 34:03.120]  and monitor people who demonstrate and we know show concerning behaviour look that hasn't
[34:03.120 --> 34:07.920]  been reported to me but that's not uncommon and we welcome that information as I said
[34:07.920 --> 34:12.720]  before if it's anybody out there that knows of someone that might be showing concerning
[34:12.720 --> 34:19.480]  behaviour around you know conspiracy theories anti-government anti-police conspiracy theories
[34:19.480 --> 34:23.840]  around COVID-19 vaccination as what we're seeing with the trained family we'd want to
[34:23.840 --> 34:28.280]  know that we want to know about that and you can either contact police directly or go through
[34:28.280 --> 34:36.080]  crime stop so let's unpack that you can read the article at info wars.com let's unpack
[34:36.080 --> 34:43.080]  that for just a minute conspiracy theories questioning the shots everything they told
[34:43.080 --> 34:49.080]  us about the shots was a lie people are getting sick and dying in mass and your anti-police
[34:49.080 --> 34:55.640]  you're a terrorist she brings up conspiracy theories that means questioning known liars
[34:55.640 --> 35:00.920]  not being a fool knowing tomorrow's news today and she says oh yes with my counterterrorism
[35:00.920 --> 35:05.440]  training and working with the federal government you know we we need to watch these people and
[35:05.440 --> 35:10.360]  if you hear them people that shouldn't be demonstrating you need to call us that's right you're not
[35:10.360 --> 35:14.200]  allowed to demonstrate against the lockdown not not to demonstrate they want you to have
[35:14.200 --> 35:18.380]  a smartphone leave your house and the police give you 15 minutes to call them when they
[35:18.380 --> 35:23.600]  text you to make sure you're in your home even when you're not quarantining if you don't
[35:23.600 --> 35:28.680]  like that you're a terrorist no lady let me tell you who the terrorist are the people
[35:28.680 --> 35:33.120]  following the WEF agenda the criminals that run the Australian government that have gone
[35:33.120 --> 35:39.240]  along with this and there are now major investigations in Australia there are major hearings happening
[35:39.240 --> 35:43.920]  in your federal government you have senators and others that are calling this a criminal
[35:43.920 --> 35:49.240]  takeover and so you will be brought to justice not just your bosses and it's the same thing
[35:49.240 --> 35:54.360]  Fauci will be brought to justice the globalist will be brought to justice Bill Gates will
[35:54.360 --> 36:00.360]  be brought to justice the world has awakened so you try to call us terrorist all you want
[36:00.360 --> 36:06.480]  but the German vice president has come out and said they need to investigate all the
[36:06.480 --> 36:10.520]  deaths that are happening and have a criminal investigation there is a criminal investigation
[36:10.520 --> 36:15.360]  by the state government of Florida there are more criminal investigations starting so you
[36:15.360 --> 36:20.240]  try to gaslight everybody you try to intimidate everybody you try to tell us we can't point
[36:20.240 --> 36:24.480]  out people are dead and dying around us or that the studies on the shots show that's
[36:24.480 --> 36:32.400]  the case there's a 13% increase in deaths on average in nations that took the shots you
[36:32.400 --> 36:41.080]  are a tyrant you signed on to a criminal cabal worldwide and took its orders and that's why
[36:41.080 --> 36:46.000]  they've got the head of the secret service which is their federal police in New Zealand
[36:46.000 --> 36:50.920]  saying we are tracking people that protest and don't like lockdowns and don't want to
[36:50.920 --> 36:55.840]  take shots of their terrorist and that's why you just heard that again from her because
[36:55.840 --> 37:02.200]  that's the last resort of these tyrants is trying to intimidate us and bully us into submission
[37:02.200 --> 37:08.840]  but we're not going to be bullied and notice it's almost all women in power positions promoting
[37:08.840 --> 37:12.200]  this I'm not against women being in power positions but it's who the globalists go and
[37:12.200 --> 37:17.640]  get it's who they recruit because it looks less threatening to have a woman doing this
[37:17.640 --> 37:22.720]  now the new Italian prime minister is a woman and she says the shots are dangerous she says
[37:22.720 --> 37:26.920]  it's about a casual society she says it's about world government she says it's about
[37:26.920 --> 37:31.000]  the destruction of the family she says they criminal investigations which have now begun
[37:31.000 --> 37:39.320]  in Italy so as bad as all this is the pushback ladies and gentlemen has begun and that wouldn't
[37:39.320 --> 37:43.240]  have happened without your support this broadcast and I salute you and I thank you for caring

[39:00.240 --> 39:07.040]  a nothing burger and congressman who authored the bill that Obama signed in a law to create
[39:07.040 --> 39:13.760]  this private secretive quasi-governmental multi-agency group to surveillance spy on the American
[39:13.760 --> 39:19.680]  people they're the ones that actually cosponsored the bill while they run around saying it doesn't
[39:19.680 --> 39:25.800]  exist but now the FBI said to back off the last three days said okay it's all real but
[39:25.800 --> 39:35.120]  it's business as usual well yeah for tyrants tyranny is business as usual Elon Musk responds
[39:35.120 --> 39:45.880]  to media's latest twitter related attack we have only just begun quoting John Paul Jones
[39:45.880 --> 39:51.320]  and I've been saying last week Elon Musk needs to come out and point out that it's all the
[39:51.320 --> 39:56.240]  big tech companies doing it not just twitter show that people understand that it is a concerted
[39:56.240 --> 40:00.920]  criminal operation he came out yesterday and said just that that for the internet to be
[40:00.920 --> 40:05.640]  free all tech needs to be free and it's not just a twitter problem and then he went on
[40:05.640 --> 40:10.440]  to point out what was really going on so I don't know if he's listening or he just understands
[40:10.440 --> 40:16.120]  logic but Elon Musk is just getting better and better that does not mean I trust him
[40:16.120 --> 40:20.920]  I'm just saying he's bearing good fruit on this subject here's the big article it's on
[40:20.920 --> 40:27.760]  info wars.com from RT every social media firm censors for US government I wouldn't call
[40:27.760 --> 40:34.840]  it the US government I'd call it the shadow occupied government the the the the illegal
[40:34.840 --> 40:42.600]  hijackers of the government and Musk goes on to break all that down every social media
[40:42.600 --> 40:48.040]  company is engaged in heavy censorship with significant involvement of and at times explicit
[40:48.040 --> 40:54.520]  direction of the government must tweeted adding that Google frequently makes links simply
[40:54.520 --> 41:01.240]  disappear ladies and gentlemen world economic forum cancels twitter directs followers to
[41:01.240 --> 41:08.040]  Chinese social media apps run by the Chinese government and they're about to have their
[41:08.040 --> 41:13.080]  meeting coming up in communist China they have meetings every month they've got one next
[41:13.080 --> 41:19.080]  month and then one in the middle of the summer in China very important information that that
[41:19.080 --> 41:26.360]  is unfolding meanwhile there's this big story yesterday that went viral Putin's chief advisor
[41:26.360 --> 41:33.560]  predicts US civil war resulting in Elon Musk presidency former president Dmitry Medvedev
[41:34.680 --> 41:40.920]  list out 10 outlandish predictions for 2023 and I do think most of them are outlandish
[41:42.120 --> 41:50.040]  Elon Musk called them outlandish but but there is some some truth to it but
[41:50.040 --> 41:59.320]  but this is a long ongoing Russian mirage or Russian fantasy that I see from their leaders
[41:59.320 --> 42:06.120]  on a routine basis that the United States is going to disappear in a civil war that's not
[42:06.120 --> 42:10.520]  actually what the globalist plan is they'll call the civil war but all that will happen is the
[42:10.520 --> 42:14.840]  globalists will fully take control of what's left the country and take over the governorships
[42:14.840 --> 42:19.560]  and then Russia and others are going to have a big problem and so are the American people
[42:19.560 --> 42:25.000]  inside this country so I want to read over this article read over his predictions when we come

[44:01.320 --> 44:07.000]  survival skills basically I was 275 pounds I was overweight I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe
[44:07.000 --> 44:11.720]  I was barely holding on to a job and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it so the
[44:11.720 --> 44:16.840]  first one I got was the original survival shield the X1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly
[44:16.840 --> 44:20.680]  thereafter you came out with that you had you know with a deeper source you know and I got really
[44:20.680 --> 44:26.120]  excited about that so I took it and man in two weeks I went from brain fog to like literally
[44:26.120 --> 44:31.880]  like my brain was enlightened you know I could think again I could connect with people again and
[44:31.880 --> 44:37.080]  over the course of the next couple of years I got my health back and I religiously took basically
[44:37.080 --> 44:41.000]  all of your supplements they're they're all absolutely amazing supplements the one I like
[44:41.000 --> 44:45.880]  recently is knockout literally like if you want to sleep just take it it's amazing it works but

[44:50.440 --> 44:55.240]  system and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hand. Beautifully said

[48:12.440 --> 48:19.560]  control tricks that are so afraid of the message you hear on this transmission. So let's read this
[48:19.560 --> 48:26.280]  article from Fox News. Putin's chief advisor predicts US civil war resulting in Elon Musk
[48:26.280 --> 48:37.320]  presidency. Dmitry Mededyev lists out 10 outlandish predictions for 2023. Fox News correspondence
[48:37.880 --> 48:44.680]  boy reports on Russia's ultimatum Ukraine as war reaches its 11th month. Their foreign minister
[48:44.680 --> 48:49.160]  Latorov is now threatening nuclear war. A chief advisor to Russian president Vladimir Putin made
[48:49.160 --> 48:57.240]  a series of bizarre predictions for 2023 Tuesday in a tweet where he claimed the US would enter
[48:57.240 --> 49:09.560]  into a civil war and Elon Musk would come out on top. Dmitry Mededyev deputy head of Putin's
[49:09.560 --> 49:15.160]  advisory security council took to Twitter to share his humble contribution what he thinks
[49:16.120 --> 49:22.520]  could unfold in the next year. Here's one of the predictions. Civil war will break out in the US.
[49:22.520 --> 49:28.600]  He said in a list of wild predictions California and Texas becoming independent states as a result
[49:28.600 --> 49:33.480]  Texas and Mexico will form an allied state. That's not going to happen. He continued Mexico would
[49:33.480 --> 49:40.360]  never do that. Elon Musk will win the presidential election in a number of states which after the
[49:40.360 --> 49:46.520]  new civil war will end will have been given to the GOP. Of course that's ignoring the law that
[49:46.520 --> 49:53.640]  you've got to be natural born to be president. Russia's Mededyev went on to say G will have a
[49:53.640 --> 50:00.040]  response to this. Russia's president Vladimir Putin is the current president but Mededyev was
[50:00.040 --> 50:05.320]  previously the president in between the few years where Putin was out of office but Mededyev a former
[50:05.320 --> 50:09.800]  Russian president and ardent supporter of the war in Ukraine didn't only make surprising predictions
[50:09.800 --> 50:19.480]  about the US. The advisor also forecast a series of astonishing crashes within the European Union
[50:19.480 --> 50:25.560]  by predicting the UK will reverse its Brexit policy and rejoin the EU which will subsequently
[50:25.560 --> 50:32.120]  lead to the collapse and disappearance of the euro and the euro is toppling on the edge of collapse
[50:32.120 --> 50:40.920]  so that prediction isn't as crazy. He continued to say that Poland and Hungary will occupy Ukraine
[50:40.920 --> 50:45.400]  and a fourth Reich will be created that could encompass the territory of Germany and its
[50:45.400 --> 50:53.800]  satellites i.e Poland, the Baltic states, Chechnya, Slovakia, the Kiev Republic and other outcast.
[50:53.800 --> 50:58.360]  War will break out between France and the fourth Reich. Europe will be divided, Poland
[51:00.840 --> 51:07.320]  repatriated in the process. He said we're adding that Northern Ireland will end up in the UK leaving
[51:07.320 --> 51:14.760]  the UK to reunite with the Republic of Ireland. Mededyev also widely claimed that the stock market
[51:14.760 --> 51:20.040]  in the US and Europe will transition to Asia before assessing that the International Monetary
[51:20.040 --> 51:25.480]  Fund in the World Bank would crash bringing an end to the US dollar and the euro. Digital fiat
[51:25.480 --> 51:33.320]  currencies will be actively used instead. Musk appeared to enjoy the outlandish 10 tweet long
[51:33.320 --> 51:41.320]  list of predictions and called it an epic thread. Musk went on to say these are definitely the most
[51:41.320 --> 51:47.720]  absurd predictions I've ever heard also showing and being astounded by the lack of awareness
[51:47.720 --> 51:52.760]  of the process of artificial intelligence and sustainable energy. He said Mededyev's tweet
[51:52.760 --> 51:59.160]  received a fair amount of attention garnering a whopping 29 million views and it went on from
[51:59.160 --> 52:04.920]  there. Sorry, I kind of babbled through that story. You know, I don't even want to say I'm tired.
[52:04.920 --> 52:15.720]  I'm not I'm not exhausted but I am just completely blown away right now and
[52:21.400 --> 52:24.920]  we're just we're just watching society go completely insane is what we're witnessing
[52:25.880 --> 52:28.680]  and I think everybody can tell at a gut level that
[52:28.680 --> 52:36.280]  things are only going to get more intense from this point out and we all know why that is.
[52:38.440 --> 52:45.560]  We have become a godless world and a godless nation and whereas we did have god before we
[52:45.560 --> 52:51.160]  weren't perfect but we knew god was in charge and put god first in many ways. We had providence and
[52:51.160 --> 52:57.960]  we had prosperity and we had potential but now all of that is going out the window.
[53:00.680 --> 53:05.640]  Now this happens in cycles throughout history and we're in the bottom of a cycle right now
[53:08.280 --> 53:11.560]  and when you pull back from the Great Reset in the New World Order you understand that
[53:13.720 --> 53:19.880]  it's part of a larger plan that they understand we're crashing so they're trying to accelerate the
[53:19.880 --> 53:26.120]  crash to control the crash but I don't see it controlling the crash I see it making the crash
[53:26.120 --> 53:31.160]  worse and when you read the nihilistic statements of the globalist and how they don't believe in
[53:31.160 --> 53:36.200]  humanity and how they say humanity is garbage now the future isn't human at the World Economic
[53:36.200 --> 53:42.600]  Forum that's their maxim and the fact that you don't see a total repudiation of them even by
[53:42.600 --> 53:48.840]  deadbeats and lazy people who don't seem to understand the New World Order sees you as a
[53:48.840 --> 53:57.720]  target and is weak and that your acquiescence and submission to them does not get you ahead
[53:59.800 --> 54:06.040]  in the world it puts you last and so that's really my great frustration
[54:07.240 --> 54:14.280]  so I'm more and more trying to focus on how do we individually as awakened people and as a remnant
[54:14.280 --> 54:20.280]  and how do we protect ourselves and I think we wake up as many people as we can because the more
[54:20.280 --> 54:24.920]  dumbed down folks following the New World Order we have around us the more danger we're all in
[54:24.920 --> 54:29.560]  collectively that's a common sense issue plus God wants to see us tell the truth and stand up and
[54:29.560 --> 54:36.680]  fight and and not go along but also we've got to try to be as healthy as we can we've got to try
[54:36.680 --> 54:42.920]  to protect our immune system as much as we can and we've got to try to build independent communities
[54:42.920 --> 54:48.760]  and societies as quickly as we can that means we've got to reassess our values and what's really
[54:48.760 --> 54:56.040]  important to us and it's not hollywood it's not netflix it's not sports games all of that has
[54:56.040 --> 55:02.760]  been again completely weaponized against civilization so you're not just wasting your time obsessing
[55:02.760 --> 55:11.400]  over that you are empowering and funding the very organizations and groups that have stated
[55:11.400 --> 55:15.480]  they believe in a post-human world so we're going to go to break in a few minutes come back and
[55:15.480 --> 55:22.040]  just take a ton of your calls next hour for all the great people that are holding and they've
[55:22.040 --> 55:27.800]  got so many great wildcard topics that they're going to be bringing up look forward to talking to
[55:27.800 --> 55:32.920]  all the listeners and viewers here in just a moment and again i'll just throw this out there at you
[55:32.920 --> 55:41.320]  i've got an article here in my stack out of newsmax that's out of a major university studies
[55:41.320 --> 55:51.480]  in the united kingdom and brazil and they found that low vitamin d increases the aging of muscle
[55:51.480 --> 56:00.520]  loss by 70 percent that's how powerful vitamin d is what it does for all your cells and what it does
[56:00.520 --> 56:07.080]  as an antiviral but if you don't have the vitamin d already in you it doesn't do much to take it once
[56:07.080 --> 56:14.360]  you're sick does a little bit but it's a preventative it's like driving around on bulb tires
[56:14.360 --> 56:19.560]  you're going to have blowouts the way you prevent blowouts is having tires that aren't too worn
[56:19.560 --> 56:23.640]  that are in good shape and not wanting to have a blowout when the tires get starting getting worn
[56:23.640 --> 56:31.080]  down the tread gets thin you replace it well you you want to put new tires on your cells you want
[56:31.080 --> 56:35.880]  to give them the protection they need as an antiviral and you need to do that with vitamin
[56:35.880 --> 56:40.120]  d3 but you need all the other vitamins and minerals as well that work in concert together
[56:41.000 --> 56:46.040]  so we're selling out of our vitamin d3 gummies that are super strong and super high quality with

[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:16.520]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance it's alex jones
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:24.200]  four words four little words that are hurting america's pandemic response what are they
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  do your own research can we all stop saying i need to do my own research nobody who's saying that
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:37.480]  is getting in the lab and doing tests at best you're reading other people's research and more
[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:42.280]  likely you're probably reading a tweet about a headline about a blog post about someone else's
[01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:47.240]  research that phrase do your own research it's popping up a lot in conversations about coronavirus
[01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:52.280]  and about covid vaccines but this go it alone approach doing your own research it seems so innocent
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:57.720]  but it can have serious consequences in other words cnn says don't do your own research what are
[01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:02.440]  the roots of this phrase i feel like i used to hear it around q anon craziness well today uh the
[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:11.880]  dear antler guy was sentenced to 41 months in prison for his role in the capital riots the same
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:16.600]  phrase do your research is being pedaled by some people who do have ill intent who want to push
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:22.040]  you down certain paths who want to either for profit reasons or for geopolitical reasons
[01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:26.680]  want to make sure that you are reading certain information as opposed to listening to authoritative
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:37.560]  sources so what should be an actually smart idea especially in the u.s with such a lack of funding
[01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:42.760]  and media literacy and all of these issues it can really actually help make things worse yeah it's
[01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:47.640]  a sneaky little phrase here's the four words that are helping to spread vaccine misinformation are
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:54.440]  you ready according to cnn here they are do your own research do your own research do your own
[01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:59.880]  research it's a sneaky little phrase that's right folks see it in here to tell you don't
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:04.600]  look into these things for yourself don't do your own research don't question anything just listen
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:11.800]  and obey he could have undermined the messaging so much that he can actually control uh exactly what
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:19.080]  people think and that is the that is our job once again the media is clamoring to tell you to stop
[01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:23.240]  looking into stuff for yourself do your own research those four words are hurting the
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:28.680]  u.s pandemic response cnn chief media correspondent brian stelter said on reliable sources sunday
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:34.200]  brian stelter visits school kids to teach them to spot misinformation he's telling him don't even
[01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:40.440]  trust satire don't trust anything but cnn reducing a liar's reach is not the same as censoring freedom
[01:04:40.440 --> 01:05:03.560]  of speech i'm taking a lot of supplements over the years since high school and they had great
[01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:09.240]  effects and the sciences got better and better and better over the years and now with all the
[01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:14.360]  things we're bombarded with and the water and the food and the feminizing factors it is more
[01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:19.160]  important than ever to use the compounds god gave us to boost our natural male potential these

[01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:31.880]  hey good morning mr jones pleasure talking to you i have two very quick questions one i'm wondering
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:39.640]  why conservative party has absolutely nobody that will organize a one month boycott against
[01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:47.560]  companies like walmart or amazon or so on and so forth and why is it that the conservative movement
[01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:54.200]  has absolutely no loyalty to anybody and they're so fractured i've given my time to you to respond
[01:09:54.200 --> 01:10:03.000]  thank you for the great call and great questions even jordan in congress gets paid off by google
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:09.240]  and he says he's thinking about having hearings about big tech you're thinking about it when they
[01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:14.600]  just stole the last two elections and have been caught illegally spying and surveilling and censoring
[01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:21.960]  i mean their loyal opposition even trump because jared kusher controlled him did sample big tech
[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:29.240]  and they stole elections from him because people don't recognize how powerful ai and big tech and
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:34.360]  all this is they don't realize it's the big issue if we can't communicate if we can't speak out as
[01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:41.000]  citizens and individuals and humans and consumers we have no rights they surveil us they're tightening
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:50.200]  the grip they censor us they steal elections and we sit here and we take it that was your question
[01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:55.880]  about why don't they stand up what was his other question oh why don't they
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:05.880]  call for a boycott of these big mega corporations that are supporting lockdowns because it shuts
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:10.440]  down their competition because they're bought and paid for that's why eric in illinois you're on the
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:19.800]  year go ahead yeah alex uh i really appreciate everything you do i love you um love you i used
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:26.840]  to listen to other guys but ever since this pandemic started you're all i listened to um

[01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:57.240]  Joe rogan made that joke at a comedy show is that like 22 years ago he said
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:12:03.080]  it's the year 2000 we're supposed to be flying around in jetpacks and have the cure to cancer but
[01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:09.640]  instead my cell phone cuts out when i'm standing behind a bush it's true sir i wanted to hear
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:16.280]  what you had to say but your your your phone line dropped bob in chicago you're on the year go ahead
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:26.280]  hey alex special agent bob we we thank god for alex jones first topic is hydroxychloroquine
[01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:35.720]  the uh youtube video you you were looking for is called uh the plague it's a dead zone uh used to be
[01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:42.680]  a series called the dead zone and two minutes into the program you can see where the actor
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:49.000]  the main character writes on the uh blackboard chloroquine before he goes into his little deal
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:53.560]  so that's the youtube well yeah the pentagon for decades did studies and found that i've
[01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:58.120]  reneged in a hydroxychloroquine knocks out basically any virus if it's taken in large
[01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:03.240]  dosages early on in the illness and so that's a well-known thing so when foushee in the media
[01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:08.280]  blocked hydroxychloroquine and i've reneged in they were premeditatedly committing mass murder
[01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:14.680]  those aren't words folks they did that think about that that's an episode from 2003 second
[01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:20.120]  subject if i will real quick is the way we're taking down the uh deep state here in chicago
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:25.640]  is we're not playing games alex you and i both know that uh there's a de facto government in
[01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:30.920]  place it's a corporation we're not under constitutional law and i'm not talking about anything with
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:37.720]  this crazy ass sorry with a crazy sovereign citizen movement we are reclaiming our status
[01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:43.480]  under the you know we operate alex under uh many codes the uniform commercial code being a big one
[01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:50.200]  right you have the option you have the option we have the option of claiming one of eight
[01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:56.360]  statuses and i was i'm 65 years old i didn't know there was another status i could change too but
[01:13:56.360 --> 01:14:03.000]  let's keep this the truth wave going the long goal here the long game is liberty we're never
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:08.040]  going to be able to experience liberty unless we're free and we've got to get free from this
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:15.240]  de facto corporation government called the united states it's not it's not our constitutional
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:22.920]  republic and the simple way you do that is through a status a status change it's legal it's lawful
[01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:26.680]  i wouldn't recommend anybody to do it unless they looked into it but that's how we're doing
[01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:31.160]  well i know this illegal aliens and aren't citizens get more rights and citizens i appreciate your

[01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:17.000]  i'll tell you where i'm at folks i know the global is cooked up
[01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:21.640]  covered i know they released another shooting little kids up a deadly poison i know they're
[01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:26.680]  murdering us and i just can't sit here anymore and just do a talk show and talk about it and i
[01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:31.240]  can't sit here and look at idiot judges with a straight face and the media and all of it when
[01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:36.520]  they're all a bunch of fools about to be killed i mean and then it's sick they actually deserve
[01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:43.400]  to be killed so part of me literally wants to join bill gates and just join in the killing
[01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:48.280]  of everybody because everybody wants to die but then bill gates is a sick freak and it's wrong to
[01:20:48.280 --> 01:21:00.920]  do that so when i do this it's gonna cause a big effect and i want listeners that are smart to know
[01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:06.360]  that i don't mean what i'm saying because i don't get up here and lie but in the
[01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:12.200]  in the goal of waking people up and i i've been wanting to do it for years i haven't been able
[01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:19.560]  to make myself do it but i can do it if i want to i'm going to convince myself i'm with the new
[01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:26.840]  world order and at some point in the near future i'm going to host a whole week of shows where i'm
[01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:31.640]  going to endorse their operations but be completely honest with you about how your trash and need to
[01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:37.000]  die and i need you to kill yourself and i need you to abort your baby and i need you to take
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:42.200]  your kid to direct wing story time i need you to sterilize your five-year-old son and and just
[01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:48.760]  fully give them what they want and worship joe biden and worship bill gates and just get on
[01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:55.800]  board with it because i could sound 10 times sicker and more evil than the noah or all over
[01:21:55.800 --> 01:22:03.160]  aurora or that piece of crap's name is but you've all know how are you just all of them are total
[01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:12.920]  filth total garbage and they want to die because they know they're scum they project their own
[01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:21.640]  wish of death on us i just wish them total destruction but i hate their guts but at the
[01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:29.080]  same time the public's just not serious enough to be able to deal with this and you're gonna die
[01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:34.360]  get that straight they're gonna murder you and your family just as sure as the sun came up this
[01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:41.720]  morning there's not much time to stop them and that's it that's basically it
[01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:51.400]  but it is a sick joke all their attacks on me and all the demonization everywhere
[01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:57.080]  they think about like that gets to me or something but gets to me is no one they're given six
[01:22:57.080 --> 01:23:01.800]  month olds by the millions deadly shots little kids are dying everywhere from these poison shots
[01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:05.160]  now they're gonna give it to newborns and miscarriages are off the charts
[01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:10.600]  and they're murdering babies inside their mothers
[01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:16.760]  and people think it's funny what type of sick freaks do this
[01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:22.840]  well they believe we deserve it because we take it well guess what i'm not taking it
[01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:27.640]  and i've been around globalist man you can feel the office and sucked out of the room
[01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:32.520]  the worst feeling the most depressed i've ever been in the presence these people so there's no
[01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:38.120]  way i'm joining them and i just wish you'd save yourselves i just wish you'd wake up i wish
[01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:44.120]  you would care and you had life force and you had will and you had strength to not be murdered by
[01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:52.440]  these people i mean they're actually doing it they're actually bringing in world government
[01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:59.480]  cutting off the resources pumping poison into us and laughing at us on tv how they're doing it
[01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:08.120]  bill gates giggling and laughing we literally shoot gmo that we have no idea what it does right in
[01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:16.200]  the kids veins and they're up there getting off on murdering people but then the public takes it
[01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:25.240]  and i'm not talking about our general audience i'm talking about people that tune in here and
[01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:30.040]  think this shows funny oh you're gonna think it's real funny when you're homeless you don't think
[01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:38.280]  it's real funny whether you've they got you in a femur cam so this is deadly serious
[01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:47.560]  deadly serious and i see all the people going along the new world order pretending like they're
[01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:55.240]  going to get ahead by serving it and you're not going to have to wait long to see what a big
[01:24:55.240 --> 01:25:00.120]  mistake you made in fact you already can see the mistake you made but it's going to get so intense
[01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:07.400]  and so over the top so quickly that i wish to god we would have stopped this
[01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:15.080]  ali in california wants to talk about the military using same tactics on our citizens
[01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:22.600]  as they did in yemen uh go ahead ali you're on the air brother alex good morning how are you doing
[01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:29.400]  sir i'm i'm actually pretty upset today you know what i am too uh my sister is in egypt right now
[01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:35.720]  and she loves your nation i dine and she appreciates you because i'll tell you what their water out
[01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:43.640]  there is so toxic it's not even funny you can't even take a shower it's bad egypt and yemen they
[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:50.200]  actually in yemen they write on the bottle how much fluoride it has and i've noticed something in yemen
[01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:58.200]  in the past 20 years my mother passed away in uh 1999 and i went to yemen in 2001 and the men were
[01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:04.680]  still um they're strong they didn't have that little strut like that walk that feminine walk
[01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:12.280]  and then i went back in 2013 and they just all have that walk like a feminine walk you know what i mean
[01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:19.400]  and they they've become godless they don't they don't even care about god anymore not too much but
[01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:24.840]  you know there's still the religious population but a lot of them are becoming degenerate they don't
[01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:31.000]  care a lot of the young people out there are serving the houthis for money and the houthis are just
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:38.360]  yemenis they're just from the north i mean from the south i'm sorry uh but uh Saudi Arabia is irrelevant
[01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:43.160]  out there it's just bombing whatever it wants the other day they hit some house that's about
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:49.000]  five miles from our village just a random house you know and said that was somebody but another
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:57.320]  thing i want to say is um i think cash app is openly um like uh messing up your transactions
[01:26:57.320 --> 01:27:03.240]  because every time i try to purchase on cash on my cash app card it doesn't go through for about a
[01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:09.400]  week or two they're doing everything behind the scenes to shut down info wars so everybody that
[01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:15.160]  fights to support us i'm very thankful there's not a place to resist more than info wars and
[01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:20.280]  you know it's all in god's hands what happens to info wars but the the general public not just in
[01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:29.560]  Yemen are in a coma and to see friends and family in the coma in the screen sickness in in the death
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:35.080]  of their soul is so painful but it's a process brother and it'll be those of us that stay with
[01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:38.680]  god and those of us that make it through this they're going to build the new world my friend
[01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:44.920]  hey thank you and it's crazy how the liberals are so jealous because this year young handsome
[01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:50.360]  man like me that's strong and i got kids and everywhere i go they tell me you have too many
[01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:56.520]  kids and i'm saying well oh yeah oh yeah i've had that happen to me uh i told my ex-wife

[01:33:21.640 --> 01:33:26.120]  all right we're taking your phone calls on this live wednesday broadcast got a special guest next
[01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:34.040]  hour let's talk to toby in rhoda island you're on the air hey alex hi i'll thank you for taking
[01:33:34.040 --> 01:33:39.400]  my call greatly appreciate it appreciate you go ahead hey i just want to do uh just reach out
[01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:45.720]  there um i'm in the aviation business um i just wanted to let you guys know um we're starting to
[01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:52.760]  see a huge uptick in myocarditis um i'm not going to name the airline um because i'm going to keep
[01:33:52.760 --> 01:34:01.160]  it confidential but as of last month we've had 60 and upwards to 95 pilots a month at a specific
[01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:09.800]  airline that are losing their metal medical because of irregular ekg and what that boils down to is
[01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:16.360]  that's a low end of 30 to 45 airplanes a month that cannot be flown which is resulting in a lot
[01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:22.840]  of cancellations this is the total sabotage of civilization remember in vietnam they came out
[01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:29.160]  reportedly with a smaller round the 223 or 556 because it didn't kill people most of the time
[01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:35.720]  but it caused major damage so you have to take care of the person that was shot and but it's the
[01:34:35.720 --> 01:34:43.160]  same thing suck our energy out by wounding people yes and then the last thing i just wanted to say
[01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:47.960]  that is absolutely no take your time tell us more because i mean it's in the news that airlines are
[01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:55.000]  having record heart attacks record sickness record myocarditis of pilots uh where they force this
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:35:01.400]  specifically what are you seeing with your airline so the biggest thing it's not happening just for
[01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:07.160]  this airline it's happening to all the airlines and the most exciting thing is whenever this happens
[01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:12.600]  you cannot go on disability because it's an emergency use authorization shot and they cannot
[01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:18.760]  get disability i've had so many people of my friends have to go live back with their parents
[01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:26.040]  because they cannot pay off three to eight hundred thousand dollars worth of debt just to go through
[01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:32.200]  an aviation program it took me almost 20 years to pay off my airline debt and i thank god that i
[01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:38.200]  got out of there while i can but it is so bad right now and that's why they're pushing single pilot
[01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:45.880]  use um you know for aircraft and and and that's right there's been filings with the faa to go to
[01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:51.720]  single pilots for passenger planes now yes and then the last thing i'm going to make on this point is
[01:35:51.720 --> 01:35:56.440]  you can pull it up also the united states air force a couple months ago they started using
[01:35:56.440 --> 01:36:01.880]  single crew operations on kc-46 tankers to see if they can do it and that's what they're doing
[01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:05.880]  that's how bad it is and the last thing just really quick i just want to reach out to everybody
[01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:12.280]  about southwest airlines this is by far the worst commercial aviation meltdown besides
[01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:20.520]  september 11th as of today today right now as of about 10 minutes ago they're at 9,745 flights
[01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:27.720]  canceled in the past 72 hours which comes out to just on the flight side over one billion with a
[01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:33.160]  b as in bravo dollars worth of lost revenue and that doesn't even include reimbursing people
[01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:37.560]  for those that understand this is a microcosm southwest it's in my stack and where do you raise
[01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:46.040]  it a microcosm of this complex economy once you sabotage it it ties up in a big a big nest of
[01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:52.040]  you know about a well like a barrel of snakes and there's no way to fix it from that point
[01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:58.040]  exactly and just the last thing i'm going to say if you guys are flying southwest just be
[01:36:58.040 --> 01:37:03.640]  patient with them but it's going to be at least another four to eight days before they can even
[01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:08.680]  start getting people on they're doing a hard reset they're going to start that they stopped booking
[01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:13.960]  up until the 31st so you cannot fly you cannot make a new reservation up until the 1st of january
[01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:18.280]  so find an alternative if you guys are trying to get home still do not fly southwest until you
[01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:24.760]  know next year is this not a microcosm of the breakdown of civilization absolutely and this
[01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:29.960]  is just the beginning it's just the beginning geez thank you for the call you know that's a
[01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:35.480]  point i'm meant to make when i came back on tuesday i had a lot of deep thought a lot of time to
[01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:42.680]  really concentrate and and reflect and it's how it's how hard our ancestors thought to build
[01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:48.120]  civilization and and how much energy went in to making a better world and now it's all being
[01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:56.760]  scrapped it's all being destroyed and just a blink of an eye for the new world order
[01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:06.440]  and the public was raised domesticated and so the predators are going to come
[01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:13.560]  it's like blood in the water to sharks and so this is all going to go down now it's all over
[01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:21.000]  folks i mean i i mean i can tell you this is just the beginning and you deserve to know
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:25.000]  the truth i think you don't need me to tell you this all hell is about to be released
[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:31.240]  and all the millions of the system that thought it was funny and cute they're gonna beg for their
[01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:40.760]  mommies during this and i guess that's what's healthy about this is all the people that serve
[01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:47.320]  the new world order are going to destroy themselves while they emulate us right along with their
[01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:53.240]  families while they burn it all down they were built against god
[01:38:56.440 --> 01:39:01.160]  it's not just that caller i mean what he says is true all over the world record sick pilots
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:07.960]  record heart attacks my cruditis they hit us with a bio weapon and particularly when you're a pilot
[01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:14.280]  and you're sitting in those seats eight hours a day the blood clots just kill you they kill you
[01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:19.800]  and you got to wrap your mind around that and i get it i knew this was coming for decades
[01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:23.960]  and for me i'm still completely freaked out i get why the public can't admit this i get why
[01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:28.120]  the public can't deal with it i get why people are denial because it's like what the social
[01:39:28.120 --> 01:39:35.000]  contract's broken they're shooting us up with a thing that grows huge protein blobs and our veins
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:42.120]  and arteries why would you do that because they're psychotic killers why did jeffrey dommer lure
[01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:48.200]  gay men to his house drug him and then inject acid into their brains to make sex slaves
[01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:51.880]  because he was a mad scientist folks
[01:39:54.680 --> 01:39:57.480]  he did medical experiments on cats and dogs he'd
[01:39:57.480 --> 01:40:07.800]  kidnap out of his neighbor's yards when he was a teenager and he moved on to humans what do you
[01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:17.400]  think fouchy is fouchy's a higher IQ jeffrey dommer and he loves the 20 million people he's killed
[01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:24.440]  he loves children having heart attacks he loves the rendezvous of ear cutting your kidneys off
[01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:34.600]  he just feels powerful he just loves killing you and he will go on killing you because he thinks
[01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:41.880]  you're weak and won't stand up against it and so all of civilization will be destroyed
[01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:48.360]  because we won't admit the predators that are attacking us bill gates
[01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:55.960]  and the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds and Peter Dasek and Anthony fouchy
[01:40:57.560 --> 01:41:01.080]  but at least when you're dying remember he killed you

[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:49.880]  good to talk to you uh love your products uh did have a problem on my last order uh
[01:48:49.880 --> 01:48:57.560]  uh i got only got one of the three things i ordered uh so hopefully they'll send them
[01:48:57.560 --> 01:49:02.040]  but anyway well let's do this let's do this because we've had some customer service problems
[01:49:02.040 --> 01:49:07.560]  so the new customer service helpline is my live show no i mean i mean this i mean this we we're
[01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:12.520]  we're in the process of getting a new customer service tell me to handle our customer service
[01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:16.520]  our customer service got really good in the last 10 years was kind of not that good 10 years ago
[01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:23.000]  it got a lot better we had some attrition and as soon as i declared bankruptcy people half the
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:27.320]  crew not my producer they're great just decided we were going under they believed the media that
[01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:31.640]  was all over so they just stopped answering the phones and stuff so what we're doing is
[01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:39.320]  next week we'll have a new customer service group uh to make sure when you call 24 hours a day
[01:49:39.320 --> 01:49:44.280]  your issue gets handled uh so do this i'm going to put you on hold and i'm going to bring you back up
[01:49:44.280 --> 01:49:50.600]  give me your name and number sir and we are going to get to your problem or i'm going to quit this

[01:49:55.880 --> 01:50:01.560]  because i can fight the new world order but i can't fight the malaise it's not just here
[01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:08.200]  but the malaise it's all over society and all over culture since the covid lockdowns of people
[01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:15.480]  not wanting to work so i understand what you're saying and i have been during the breaks dealing
[01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:20.760]  with the customer service issues so you better believe in fact i'm not even going to plug
[01:50:20.760 --> 01:50:26.440]  products anymore until this problem is handled because 99 percent of people get their products
[01:50:26.440 --> 01:50:34.040]  they love them it's great but the fact is that we dropped the ball on this issue you're absolutely
[01:50:34.040 --> 01:50:39.240]  right in fact i may just clear the lines out and cancel the next host and just take complaints on
[01:50:39.240 --> 01:50:47.880]  air because we need to get this dealt with and taken care of that's what we have to do
[01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:54.360]  because i can't seem to fix it i can't seem up here seven hours a day sometimes just on
[01:50:54.360 --> 01:50:58.760]  trying to keep the company going and trying to fund our operation even do this that's why the best
[01:50:58.760 --> 01:51:05.320]  way to fund us is just to go to infowarstore.com and there's the support info wars link and just
[01:51:05.320 --> 01:51:09.560]  give a donation because then you know your support the show and who knows that might keep us on air
[01:51:10.600 --> 01:51:15.000]  you know in the name of that i'm going off here go to rebroadcast we're done for the day
[01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:18.120]  i totally agree with the listener i'm going to go deal with this problem right now get his name
[01:51:18.120 --> 01:51:22.920]  a number uh we've got a special gregory's report here that is so important i hope everybody goes
[01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:29.720]  and checks it out it is a digital prison that's being built around you right now it is such an
[01:51:29.720 --> 01:51:34.440]  important report and who knows we shut down maybe one of the last reports you see in fact this is
[01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:38.840]  maybe the end of the show i was already thinking about this caller when you called in okay because
[01:51:38.840 --> 01:51:45.560]  i can't sit here and i can't take this anymore i can't take all of it anymore because i'm doing
[01:51:45.560 --> 01:51:51.480]  the best job i can i'm trying as hard as i can and i need to somehow fire the bat single everybody
[01:51:51.480 --> 01:51:57.880]  but this just can't continue on here's gregory's report
[01:52:01.080 --> 01:52:08.040]  a monjabi has worked in silicon valley for 28 years his background includes work on deep
[01:52:08.040 --> 01:52:15.720]  technologies that are involved in the new digital prison system being designed by big tech in 2020
[01:52:15.720 --> 01:52:21.400]  he moved to montana and became a whistleblower warning the public of the very real threat
[01:52:21.400 --> 01:52:28.920]  about to be unleashed upon us all known by many as the mark of the beast system a mon explains
[01:52:28.920 --> 01:52:35.880]  how accepting the digital id is the basic premise behind it all so by default a digital identity
[01:52:36.680 --> 01:52:43.000]  implies that you are always in a digital prison since you have a digital identity and you're in a
[01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:51.480]  prison you are by default a criminal so we don't trust you just like the old system this new one
[01:52:51.480 --> 01:52:57.560]  is also voluntary and you are supposed to know that it's a digital prison that you are voluntarily
[01:52:57.560 --> 01:53:04.840]  signing up for and the reason for this is because in this new system having a digital id will be
[01:53:04.840 --> 01:53:11.640]  proof that you are a criminal because having a digital id means that you are in a digital prison
[01:53:11.640 --> 01:53:18.200]  and because you accepted it you must be a criminal because of this there is a new protocol being
[01:53:18.200 --> 01:53:24.040]  introduced with this system known as zero trust how is zero trust going to be used
[01:53:24.840 --> 01:53:31.880]  here's a lady she wants to go and buy some beef but let's say her carbon footprint or her beef
[01:53:31.880 --> 01:53:37.960]  footprint for the month has been exceeded that door won't open this digital prison is sneaking
[01:53:37.960 --> 01:53:44.360]  up on us all there is no need for an implanted chip because everything is being done with facial
[01:53:44.360 --> 01:53:51.160]  recognition which is already plugged into the entire system america already has more cameras
[01:53:51.160 --> 01:53:58.360]  per capita than communist china and our social credit score is already being logged all we need
[01:53:58.360 --> 01:54:05.160]  at this point is a series of events that lead us all into having to make the choice of either accepting
[01:54:05.160 --> 01:54:13.640]  the new digital id or saying no since the covid lockdowns new state-of-the-art led lights have
[01:54:13.640 --> 01:54:20.280]  been replacing street lights in cities throughout the west amon explains that this is all part of
[01:54:20.280 --> 01:54:27.000]  the plan these lights will be connected to everything including your phone and your car and in new
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:35.720]  cars that includes 16 different cameras with lidar and sonar these lights are being outfitted with
[01:54:35.720 --> 01:54:43.080]  led incapacitators which is a light technology that was first announced 15 years ago back when it
[01:54:43.080 --> 01:54:49.000]  caused enough brain damage to make a person sick another strange weapon in the final stages of
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:55.960]  development is able to mount an all out barrage on the optic nerve the led incapacitator was developed
[01:54:55.960 --> 01:55:01.640]  under the auspices of the department of homeland security for the purposes of creating what we
[01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:08.680]  call a non-lethal defense system and this technology consists of a bright set of led technology
[01:55:08.680 --> 01:55:16.120]  light emitting diodes that is designed to create a sort of temporary blindness meaning
[01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:23.080]  temporary ability to not be able to see the person who we're trying to protect if aggressors caught
[01:55:23.080 --> 01:55:28.440]  in its bright pulsating glare don't shield their eyes or turn away quick enough temporary blindness
[01:55:28.440 --> 01:55:34.280]  isn't the only effect they'll feel the first time i saw the led i was in a darkened room
[01:55:34.280 --> 01:55:39.000]  and within three or four seconds i had reached forward and grabbed the hold of a lab bench
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:45.240]  because i was feeling a little bit uh uh dizzy or disoriented the device's combination of different
[01:55:45.240 --> 01:55:51.560]  colors and random flashes can induce psychophysical effects including vertigo and possible nausea
[01:55:51.560 --> 01:55:58.520]  it's been nicknamed the puke light it's been 15 years and our silicone valley whistleblower
[01:55:58.520 --> 01:56:05.880]  believes that this technology is now capable of killing people ultimately we can say no to this
[01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:11.000]  but if there's a critical maps that doesn't sign on to the digital id then this agenda gets
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:18.040]  weakened substantially but we will have to first unify and come together reporting for info wars
[01:56:18.040 --> 01:56:29.480]  this is greg reese
[01:56:33.240 --> 01:56:39.240]  thanks to you kids we now know the virus is a hoax they included flu pneumonia and other
[01:56:39.240 --> 01:56:44.120]  infections to boost the numbers let's find out who is really behind it all like president trump is
[01:56:44.120 --> 01:56:54.440]  definitely behind one of these phantoms she's pink dr fouchie like i thought doctors were
[01:56:54.440 --> 01:57:02.600]  supposed to help people not scare them microsoft's bill gates not only a computer guy he's a notorious
[01:57:02.600 --> 01:57:08.200]  vaccine pusher who wants to reduce the world's population i get it so bill gates wanted to
[01:57:08.200 --> 01:57:12.680]  vaccinate everyone after fouchie convinced them there was a deadly disease outbreak that's
[01:57:12.680 --> 01:57:18.280]  diabolical yeah that sounds pretty bad don't worry kids these globalists won't get away with
[01:57:18.280 --> 01:57:23.800]  their pandemic hoax this time where they're going they'll be locked up for a long good while in the
[01:57:23.800 --> 01:57:53.720]  big house there's a war against our masculinity there's a war in the environment
[01:57:53.800 --> 01:58:00.040]  the food the water the air the electromagnetics the injections to really cut us off from what
[01:58:00.040 --> 01:58:08.200]  god designed us to be but through mother nature the creator gave us compounds that can counteract
[01:58:08.200 --> 01:58:12.760]  what the globalists have done and i gotta tell you all our supplements are great but we've got a

[02:00:27.400 --> 02:00:34.920]  you're not as stupid as you look i yeah i don't understand the concepts of conversation of the
[02:00:34.920 --> 02:00:41.080]  gun culture we've lived with guns since what the seventh century or something i don't know we all
[02:00:41.080 --> 02:00:47.000]  know that right now gun is a total it's a metaphor that this franchise white guys need it makes them
[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:50.520]  feel good because you can say what you want i don't agree with that there's a big difference between
[02:00:50.520 --> 02:00:56.440]  fantasy land and reality fantasy land is what we do doing a movie a television show that's that's
[02:00:56.440 --> 02:01:00.760]  fantasy land and that's where that stuff belongs in reality when we're dealing with things like
[02:01:00.760 --> 02:01:05.400]  terrorism what not we're all gonna have different opinions on on on how to on how to do it how to
[02:01:05.400 --> 02:01:11.240]  deal with it mine happens to be that i think there's a very strong reason founding fathers had for
[02:01:11.240 --> 02:01:16.840]  the second amendment and that is that no government ever hasn't had to fight its own people and its
[02:01:16.840 --> 02:01:21.960]  own people hasn't had to fight its own government so we gotta do outlaw everything that in the answer
[02:01:21.960 --> 02:01:29.640]  just put something put some controls what so the people so so the people who want to defend themselves
[02:01:29.640 --> 02:01:34.360]  can't no nothing you can't just so the idiots can't get hold do you really believe they're
[02:01:34.360 --> 02:01:40.360]  not going to are you are you serious about that are you seriously what good will that oh my god
[02:01:41.720 --> 02:01:46.680]  we had our civil war if that second amendment hasn't been there those people would not have had the
[02:01:46.680 --> 02:01:52.760]  opportunity to do what they considered was defending their life their way their living
[02:01:52.760 --> 02:01:58.280]  so i agree with that i think that's an important part of our existence it's basically that simple
[02:02:02.040 --> 02:02:06.520]  painful wars the most banned network in the world
[02:02:10.360 --> 02:02:16.440]  it's called the great reset tough guy it's called the new world order it's called the big banks
[02:02:16.440 --> 02:02:21.880]  wanting to squeeze the economy and make people poor so they can loan us fiat money to take control
[02:02:21.880 --> 02:02:27.080]  of our lives with a social credit score and the universal basic income that's everything that's
[02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:32.120]  the whole future of our lives the whole world's going to be about surveillance and control and
[02:02:32.120 --> 02:02:36.200]  then manipulating and tracking everything you do it's all being officially announced we had
[02:02:36.200 --> 02:02:44.440]  articles everywhere their press releases saying and the crew asked me during the break they go
[02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:49.720]  are you all right you really seem upset you're are you feeling okay well then about that there
[02:02:49.720 --> 02:02:53.240]  war i mean they're gonna starve a couple hundred million people death yeah i'm pretty freaked out
[02:02:53.240 --> 02:02:58.760]  yeah this is real this is not this is not a freaking game to me man
[02:03:06.520 --> 02:03:12.120]  people are starting to get hundreds of millions right now you never see it on news they're dying
[02:03:12.120 --> 02:03:16.920]  right now they're in they're freaking house is starting to have begging for god to help them
[02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:22.840]  and no one's coming because god tells us to get up and take action and then we don't do anything

[02:08:19.160 --> 02:08:24.520]  lead folks to know the gravitas you're a serious guy you were on the air in late january and early
[02:08:24.520 --> 02:08:30.760]  february 2020 on my show and other shows predicting it was out of the lab predicting the shots would
[02:08:30.760 --> 02:08:37.160]  be poisoned predicting war would follow predicting world i d cards predicting the shots would cause
[02:08:37.160 --> 02:08:42.360]  mass death so out of all the pantheon of great people the dr robert malone's and the dr michael
[02:08:42.360 --> 02:08:48.840]  you know yedans you have been the most on target and and and the early bird and all this so i know
[02:08:48.840 --> 02:08:54.200]  you want to get into the war in ukraine and expanding and that existential threat i want to
[02:08:54.200 --> 02:09:01.880]  hit that but first total vindication dr boil it's like you had a crystal ball well alex uh
[02:09:01.880 --> 02:09:08.600]  a lot of this credit goes to you because uh you're the only person in the uh mainstream
[02:09:08.600 --> 02:09:14.920]  news me is that would let me uh talk about these things uh i first blew the whistle on it on
[02:09:14.920 --> 02:09:25.960]  uh january 24 2020 uh in a worldwide uh alert uh the dangers here that uh covid 19 was an
[02:09:26.600 --> 02:09:36.040]  offensive biological warfare weapon uh that had leaked out of the uh wuhan bsl4 and then later on
[02:09:36.040 --> 02:09:46.840]  on your program i said that uh any uh franken shots that big pharma developed here would be
[02:09:46.840 --> 02:09:57.320]  more dangerous than useless and then later on on your show i said uh messenger rna is very powerful
[02:09:57.320 --> 02:10:07.160]  stuff to inject it to your body and it could discombobulate your entire genetic system now i
[02:10:07.160 --> 02:10:14.760]  said that very early on as you correctly pointed out in early uh february to you and on uh info
[02:10:14.760 --> 02:10:23.080]  wars and some of your uh collie so kudos to you and to info wars for letting me speak to truth
[02:10:23.080 --> 02:10:28.680]  to the american people but but how did you know i mean i know you were wrote the bio weapons laws
[02:10:28.680 --> 02:10:33.480]  and were a top prosecutor at the un but just how did you nail it so i mean you totally nailed it
[02:10:36.440 --> 02:10:42.760]  well except we've discussed this before i think the most important point now from my perspective
[02:10:42.760 --> 02:10:54.520]  are these uh proposed regulations by the world health authority uh and also the proposed pandemic
[02:10:54.520 --> 02:11:04.440]  treaty by the world health organization that are now under consideration uh over in juneva i have
[02:11:04.440 --> 02:11:15.640]  read both the uh regulations and the tree uh and according to either one or both they will
[02:11:15.640 --> 02:11:26.440]  established uh a scientific and medical police state that will cover the entire world and that
[02:11:26.440 --> 02:11:36.200]  will usurp and negate the sovereignty of the united states of america as well as the sovereignty
[02:11:36.760 --> 02:11:43.160]  of the states of the union under the tenth amendment of the united states constitution
[02:11:43.880 --> 02:11:53.240]  and penetrate right down to our primary care physicians you will have dr tetros there the
[02:11:53.240 --> 02:12:04.040]  who telling our medical doctors how to treat us this will be a one-way path to the cemetery
[02:12:04.040 --> 02:12:14.440]  for all americans and right now we must get organized to defeat the who uh regulations
[02:12:14.440 --> 02:12:20.840]  and the who treaty on uh future and let's be clear you're a guy that writes us and you and
[02:12:20.840 --> 02:12:25.000]  regulations there couldn't be a better guess to describe this and you've read the treaty
[02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:28.760]  you've read the regulations and you're saying what we've been hearing is true that it is a
[02:12:28.760 --> 02:12:35.800]  worldwide biomedical big pharma corporate police state that's correct and as a matter of fact uh
[02:12:36.920 --> 02:12:45.320]  alex i've uh researched study and talk international organizations starting from my
[02:12:45.320 --> 02:12:53.240]  student days at harvard law school up until today uh uh beginning with the first haig peace conference
[02:12:53.240 --> 02:13:01.480]  of 1899 up through and including the united nations organization you can read about this my book
[02:13:01.480 --> 02:13:10.600]  foundations of world order uh duke university press 1999 which was half of my phd uh dissertation
[02:13:10.600 --> 02:13:19.320]  at harvard so yes i've done this work professionally for all those years indeed the most insidious part
[02:13:20.040 --> 02:13:29.240]  of the who treaty from my perspective uh is that the concluding clause has been drafted
[02:13:30.040 --> 02:13:40.520]  so that it will come into effect immediately upon signature by biden's delegate let me repeat
[02:13:40.520 --> 02:13:49.640]  that it will come into effect immediately upon signature for biden's delegate despite the requirements
[02:13:49.640 --> 02:13:57.160]  of the united states constitution that all treaties must receive the advice and consent
[02:13:57.160 --> 02:14:07.160]  of the united states senate uh a clear cut uh uh usurpation of our constitution as well as the
[02:14:07.160 --> 02:14:15.400]  uh uh tenth amendment guaranteeing that uh all rights not delegated to the uh federal government
[02:14:15.400 --> 02:14:22.600]  reside in the hands of the states the union uh or uh the people and so what will happen under
[02:14:22.600 --> 02:14:30.280]  this treaty and also under the regulations people like uh governor uh desantis governor abbot uh
[02:14:30.280 --> 02:14:39.720]  uh uh uh and others uh who do not accept the party line coming out of the cdc will be side
[02:14:39.720 --> 02:14:43.480]  sept and usurped and that was my next question we'll come back from break we'll get into the
[02:14:43.480 --> 02:14:47.720]  world treaty and more than get into the war in ukraine that's the currently the big obviously
[02:14:47.720 --> 02:14:53.000]  the front burner thread but what do you make of the german vice president saying we need
[02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:58.360]  investigations criminal investigations uh the the attorney the supreme court three days ago
[02:14:58.360 --> 02:15:05.240]  green lighting criminal investigations in florida that's got to be encouraging right i have read the
[02:15:07.160 --> 02:15:14.600]  request for a grand jury that governor desantis uh uh filed with the florida supreme court
[02:15:15.240 --> 02:15:23.480]  and then i have read the uh terms of reference uh given by the florida supreme court uh they are
[02:15:23.480 --> 02:15:30.920]  broad enough uh in my opinion to include uh indictments against everyone involved here
[02:15:31.480 --> 02:15:38.840]  for murder and conspiracy to commit murder uh in accordance with uh florida law and i certainly
[02:15:38.840 --> 02:15:41.880]  would would encourage uh don't well stay there i'm going to try to shut up give me the floor
[02:15:41.880 --> 02:15:46.520]  let's come back with that finish up with covet and then get into the world war three situation
[02:15:46.520 --> 02:15:50.760]  and that ladder of escalation you warned of two months ago on the show that we've now moved up
[02:15:50.760 --> 02:15:54.680]  several rooms on wow dr frances a boils our guest stay with us

[02:20:15.080 --> 02:20:18.360]  all right dr. frances say boil author researcher
[02:20:20.120 --> 02:20:25.560]  a man that wrote the u.s. biological chemical weapons law former u.n. war crimes prosecutor
[02:20:25.560 --> 02:20:31.800]  got caught off by the break he was getting into the german vice president saying he wants an
[02:20:31.800 --> 02:20:37.640]  investigation of the shots the criminal investigation launched by the state of florida and more
[02:20:38.680 --> 02:20:42.600]  and then finishing up with all the gain of function news and what's coming out and what
[02:20:42.600 --> 02:20:47.720]  he thinks the deep state's gonna do now because they're being so exposed elon must coming out
[02:20:47.720 --> 02:20:53.240]  pointing out that foushee's wife runs the bioethics board that controls what he can do i mean is this
[02:20:53.240 --> 02:20:58.520]  whole incestuous bio weapons program comes out looks like it's blown up with their face please
[02:20:58.520 --> 02:21:07.160]  continue dr. boil right again one point to drive home for your audience to understand
[02:21:07.880 --> 02:21:15.320]  trump pulled us out of the who for good cause i agree with that decision one of the first
[02:21:15.320 --> 02:21:24.120]  steps biden made as president was to put us back into the who and he appointed tony foushee
[02:21:24.840 --> 02:21:32.840]  as the u.s. government's representative on the executive council of the who now think about
[02:21:32.840 --> 02:21:42.360]  that for a minute that's where the who treaty and the wha regulations are coming from tony foushee
[02:21:42.360 --> 02:21:49.240]  and on that you we've discussed foushee before you can read bobby kennedy's book on the real
[02:21:49.240 --> 02:21:57.480]  entity foushee it's all in there so it's clear what happened here is that foushee and his ilk
[02:21:58.440 --> 02:22:08.040]  like bill gates like big pharma like the bio warfare industry when they saw the opposition
[02:22:08.040 --> 02:22:19.240]  coming from american people and governors and other elected officials decided to do an enron
[02:22:19.240 --> 02:22:27.800]  around all of us by going to the who and drafting these regulations and this treaty
[02:22:28.360 --> 02:22:36.840]  that will set up a worldwide scientific medical police state under the control of
[02:22:36.840 --> 02:22:45.480]  tendrils and bill gates and the bio warfare industry big pharma and the chinese communist
[02:22:45.480 --> 02:22:53.960]  government that gives a lot of money to the who that is what is confronting us today alex as
[02:22:53.960 --> 02:23:01.960]  citizens of the united states of america we have to stop these wha regulations we must stop this
[02:23:01.960 --> 02:23:11.240]  who treaty if we want to live in freedom here in the united states again you've read the treaty
[02:23:11.240 --> 02:23:16.920]  you've read the regulations and that that's what i've seen congress people say the same thing you
[02:23:16.920 --> 02:23:22.040]  said i've looked over as well i mean it looks like the un gets control of pandemic response
[02:23:22.040 --> 02:23:25.800]  but then the un i saw their hearings three years ago before the pandemic was announced
[02:23:25.800 --> 02:23:32.600]  in in uh december of 2019 the head of their vaccine program said we're just told by the big
[02:23:32.600 --> 02:23:38.040]  pharma what to say about these shots we don't even test them so the un itself if the un will be in
[02:23:38.040 --> 02:23:46.920]  control under this treaty who's in control of the un well you know you get what you pay for he
[02:23:46.920 --> 02:23:56.840]  who pays the piper calls the tune i mean no yes the un is a rotten corrupt and despicable organization
[02:23:56.840 --> 02:24:03.240]  when i was the lawyer for the republic of bosnia and herzegovina during the war in genocide against
[02:24:03.240 --> 02:24:13.240]  them uh the united nations the european union its member states and bill clinton at un headquarters
[02:24:13.240 --> 02:24:20.280]  in geneva tried to carve up the republic of bosnia and herzegovina into two little three
[02:24:20.280 --> 02:24:28.120]  little bitty pieces of land rob bosnia of their uh un membership destroy their statehood under
[02:24:28.120 --> 02:24:37.880]  international law and subject 1.5 to 2 million more bosnians to ethnic cleansing when we already had
[02:24:37.880 --> 02:24:45.000]  2 million victims of ethnic cleansing now i stopped them it never happened bosnia herzegovina is
[02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:51.160]  still there today uh and they have their un membership but that's what they were going to do to the
[02:24:51.160 --> 02:24:58.680]  poor bosnians so you've lived the predatory nature of the un i want to get into all the other big
[02:24:58.680 --> 02:25:02.920]  subjects but you're a un insider a guy that you know tried to reform it but couldn't obviously
[02:25:02.920 --> 02:25:08.680]  discipline worked there what is the un now basically a corporate front group of corporate fascist or
[02:25:08.680 --> 02:25:16.200]  what is it i think corporate fascist is good description certainly for the uh un secretariat
[02:25:16.200 --> 02:25:21.080]  right i i think that's a yes so the general body is a debating club of no power but the actual
[02:25:21.640 --> 02:25:28.520]  un and the security council that's that's fascist well the secretariat the bureaucracy right and
[02:25:28.520 --> 02:25:37.720]  then they control the specialized agencies like the who sure and we all know the who could the un
[02:25:37.720 --> 02:25:48.040]  be reformed i really don't know at this point it my assessment alex was when i was at uh uh un
[02:25:48.040 --> 02:25:56.360]  headquarters in juneva and they were uh trying to destroy the bosnians a un member state uh it
[02:25:56.360 --> 02:26:04.280]  struck me that historically this was uh at the uh situation of the decline of the inevitable
[02:26:04.280 --> 02:26:11.160]  decline of the league of nations when highly salacy appeared in the exact same location
[02:26:11.880 --> 02:26:20.760]  i was an appeal for the league to save ambicinia from musolini and his fascists and they did nothing
[02:26:20.760 --> 02:26:28.040]  so i i regret to say the un is on is on decline that's a great example of when the ethiopian
[02:26:28.040 --> 02:26:31.640]  leader tried to stop that and that could have stopped world war two that he done something then
[02:26:33.960 --> 02:26:39.800]  it could have sure but they didn't and indeed in the case of the bosnians it was far worse
[02:26:39.800 --> 02:26:45.640]  they tried to get rid of us and i stopped them yes i do and your own record doing that you've
[02:26:45.640 --> 02:26:49.800]  done so many amazing things i know when i asked you know to talk about how you know all this you
[02:26:49.800 --> 02:26:53.640]  just moved on the next subject but your knowledge is just incredible i mean it's amazing to be able
[02:26:53.640 --> 02:26:58.520]  to pick your brain we got two minutes to break you know what subjects you want to go to next
[02:27:00.360 --> 02:27:05.880]  well we can move on to ukraine if you want to sure let's do that give us a prelude of what's
[02:27:05.880 --> 02:27:14.520]  coming up well if we don't stop biden we're going to have a direct war with russia right now
[02:27:14.520 --> 02:27:23.560]  now there is an indirect war a de facto state of war between the united states and and russia
[02:27:24.040 --> 02:27:32.600]  even for mr levrov has said that so we're going to have to stop the bidenites before they continue
[02:27:32.600 --> 02:27:40.120]  up this ladder of escalation you have the list there the con letter a letter of escalation
[02:27:40.120 --> 02:27:48.440]  developed by for rand and the pentagon and if you skip down just a little bit you'll see we're at
[02:27:48.440 --> 02:27:58.040]  stage 20 the no nuclear use threshold we're right there peaceful worldwide embargo right that's
[02:27:58.040 --> 02:28:06.840]  exactly what we have today against the russian federation biden and the european union member
[02:28:06.840 --> 02:28:16.200]  states are waging uh economic warfare against the russian federation we in my opinion i think we're
[02:28:16.200 --> 02:28:22.840]  one step below uh the nuclear threshold there as identified by herman and that's what you said two
[02:28:22.840 --> 02:28:26.120]  months ago on the show that's what lavarov said yesterday he said we're entering the nuclear
[02:28:26.120 --> 02:28:34.840]  threshold this needs to stop now right it has to stop now and yet you will see the bidenites refuse
[02:28:34.840 --> 02:28:41.560]  adamantly refuse to negotiate uh uh just the other day putin said he will negotiate
[02:28:41.560 --> 02:28:48.200]  levrov would say they will negotiate the bidenites refuse and and of course zolensky refuses but he's
[02:28:48.200 --> 02:28:53.560]  our puppet uh zolensky tells whatever well let's talk about what comes next with dr frances boil

[02:32:00.120 --> 02:32:05.640]  shield basically i was 275 pounds i was overweight i had brain fog like you wouldn't believe i was
[02:32:05.640 --> 02:32:10.440]  barely holding on to a job and i heard dr group on your show and i listened to it so the first one
[02:32:10.440 --> 02:32:15.560]  i got was the original survival shield the x1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter
[02:32:15.560 --> 02:32:19.320]  you came out with x2 you had you know with a deep burden source you know and i got really excited
[02:32:19.320 --> 02:32:25.720]  about that so i took it and man in two weeks i went from brain fog to like literally like my brain
[02:32:25.720 --> 02:32:31.160]  was enlightened you know i could think again i could connect with people again and over the course
[02:32:31.160 --> 02:32:35.800]  of the next couple of years i got my health back and i religiously take basically all of your
[02:32:35.800 --> 02:32:40.600]  supplements they're they're all absolutely amazing supplements the one i like recently is knockout
[02:32:40.600 --> 02:32:45.080]  it literally like if you want to sleep just take it it's amazing it works but anyway so the point
[02:32:45.080 --> 02:32:49.720]  is we have to get ourselves clean we have to break free of the globalist system and the only way
[02:32:49.720 --> 02:32:54.920]  to do that is to take our own health into our own hand beautifully said brother i thank you so much
[02:32:54.920 --> 02:33:05.080]  for calling godspeed leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[02:33:11.320 --> 02:33:18.600]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny
[02:33:18.600 --> 02:33:26.040]  well so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[02:33:28.760 --> 02:33:34.120]  all our folks are really waking up to the city lockdowns and the climate lockdowns that are
[02:33:34.120 --> 02:33:41.640]  being announced the 15-minute cities i said a very well-known podcaster texts me and asked is this
[02:33:41.640 --> 02:33:47.720]  real and yes it's real we've been covering it for years but tomorrow i'm just gonna open the show up
[02:33:47.720 --> 02:33:53.000]  no matter how big the news is with the 15-minute cities and the un lockdowns the climate lockdowns
[02:33:53.560 --> 02:33:58.040]  and and all the rest of it but we're talking to dr frances a boil right now who wrote the us
[02:33:58.040 --> 02:34:04.680]  biological chemical weapons laws it was the top un war crimes prosecutor and more and who's the most
[02:34:04.680 --> 02:34:11.640]  accurate person predicting almost three years ago starting in january of 2020 what was gonna unfold
[02:34:11.640 --> 02:34:19.240]  and happen uh so we were continuing on we hit the break with russia and this escalation ladder a
[02:34:19.240 --> 02:34:26.520]  generalized uh scenario the rand corporation and the pentagon that were at point 20 what point 44
[02:34:27.480 --> 02:34:33.720]  means and where this huge escalation is going and what the neocons and the crazy democrats think
[02:34:33.720 --> 02:34:42.840]  they're doing please continue well again we saw this uh massive propaganda campaign by the bidenites
[02:34:43.800 --> 02:34:51.960]  to bring uh zolensky uh over here and try to get uh support from the american people in congress
[02:34:52.680 --> 02:35:00.280]  for this uh existentially dangerous uh war against russia that is going on right now you know i
[02:35:00.280 --> 02:35:10.920]  teach the uh laws of war and uh i would say right now with russia we are in a de facto state of war
[02:35:11.480 --> 02:35:20.440]  with russia uh it is not yet a de jure state of war with russia but it's certainly a de facto
[02:35:20.440 --> 02:35:26.920]  and again foreign minister la vogue who's a very uh experienced consummate diplomat as i said the
[02:35:26.920 --> 02:35:35.320]  same thing here so it's extremely dangerous uh anything could uh set this off and then rather
[02:35:35.320 --> 02:35:44.280]  than deescalate the situation uh biden and the democrats zip bring uh zolensky over here uh to
[02:35:44.280 --> 02:35:49.800]  escalate well this is like it's imagine of kennedy vacation in the u.s virgin islands
[02:35:49.800 --> 02:35:55.000]  for two weeks during the human missile crisis he'd be impeached uh shouldn't we move as you
[02:35:55.000 --> 02:36:02.600]  pushed four months ago to impeach biden immediately for war crimes well yes that's true but let's
[02:36:02.600 --> 02:36:10.120]  compare this to the cuban missile crisis because i i think it's it's very instructive that uh uh
[02:36:10.120 --> 02:36:19.160]  for russia this is even more dangerous than the cuban missile crisis in reverse because in our
[02:36:19.160 --> 02:36:29.000]  case cuba was 90 miles south of uh of florida uh this is right on their borders and the second thing
[02:36:29.800 --> 02:36:39.000]  i think we need to consider is that biden is no jfk uh whatever you think of jfk he volunteered
[02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:48.600]  for combat during world war two and uh uh performed uh heroically courageously and was seriously uh
[02:36:48.600 --> 02:36:56.040]  injured well biden's done nothing with his uh career but be on the payroll of there in delaware
[02:36:56.680 --> 02:37:02.360]  of wall street and the banksters and everyone else who does their corporate headquarters in
[02:37:02.360 --> 02:37:07.720]  delaware because that's the most stable right kennedy engaged a japanese destroyer with a small
[02:37:07.720 --> 02:37:13.080]  patrol boat got his back broken and we know the whole story here very heroic and then meanwhile
[02:37:13.080 --> 02:37:19.000]  if we if we go up this chain of what's happening it's very apocalyptic to have biden vacationing
[02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:28.200]  while this is going on right and that you know kennedy tried to deescalate the most of his advisors
[02:37:28.200 --> 02:37:35.720]  on the uh executive committee uh except for uh adly stevenson here in the state of ellen y and
[02:37:35.720 --> 02:37:43.640]  under secretary state george ball who was a friend of mine uh uh tried to restrain everyone else on
[02:37:43.640 --> 02:37:50.120]  the executive committee from invading uh cuba that would have set off a nuclear that's right
[02:37:50.120 --> 02:37:55.800]  llm that's her to slay all them wanted to go to full war that's correct and it would have very
[02:37:55.800 --> 02:38:03.560]  quickly become a nuclear war yes well who's who's who's restraint on biden indeed who's really home
[02:38:03.560 --> 02:38:11.560]  there uh with biden i i regret to say i i think biden is in the advanced stages of else i agree so
[02:38:11.560 --> 02:38:14.920]  let's go up this ladder here because you bring this up and now the russians are bringing up the
[02:38:14.920 --> 02:38:22.200]  ladder so you've got one up to 20 peaceful and quotes worldwide embargo blockade then we moved
[02:38:22.200 --> 02:38:27.160]  to local nuclear war which labirah that others are saying is next the declaration of limited
[02:38:27.160 --> 02:38:34.280]  nuclear war uh and then we've got local nuclear war military unusual provocative and significant
[02:38:34.280 --> 02:38:42.920]  countermeasures evacuation 26 demonstration of attack on zone of interior well that we've kind
[02:38:42.920 --> 02:38:47.480]  of skipped ahead with all these cruise missile attacks inside russia how big a provocation
[02:38:47.480 --> 02:38:52.120]  is that in the last month just like they've kind of skipped ahead here to internal provocations in
[02:38:52.120 --> 02:39:04.120]  russia well uh again yes it does appear they're trying to provoke russia into more substantial
[02:39:04.840 --> 02:39:13.000]  military action against them we have to understand whatever the ukrainian military is doing today
[02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:21.000]  today has been green lighted by the pentagon and the biden administration and all these attacks
[02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:29.960]  into uh russia itself uh rely on a us gps coordination so the russians know this they've
[02:39:29.960 --> 02:39:38.040]  even said this that they're basically it's the americans using the ukrainians uh to engage in
[02:39:38.040 --> 02:39:47.720]  direct attacks against russia and uh the bidenites if you read the news media have made it clear that
[02:39:47.720 --> 02:39:55.080]  they don't believe that the russians are serious about any of their red lines and so they are going
[02:39:55.080 --> 02:40:02.040]  to keep pushing up this ladder of escalation which makes it an extremely uh existentially dangerous
[02:40:02.040 --> 02:40:07.640]  so why would the pentagon and nato openly be running the attacks coordinating them and trying to
[02:40:07.640 --> 02:40:15.880]  escalate russia to a full military commitment we date the pentagon believes we have uh escalation
[02:40:15.880 --> 02:40:25.320]  dominance at every uh ladder at every uh uh uh wrong of that letter that we we can control and
[02:40:25.320 --> 02:40:31.240]  dominate so they're pushing and tricking the russians into pulling into polian invading russia
[02:40:31.240 --> 02:40:39.080]  but in reverse that well again it's it's the lessons learned from the cuban missile crisis
[02:40:39.080 --> 02:40:45.080]  which i think were the wrong lessons uh but that's by uh uh thomas shelling of harvard
[02:40:45.080 --> 02:40:51.000]  ahead of me in the government department his arms and influence where shelling talked about
[02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:59.560]  compelence mainly during the cuban missile crisis we had escalation dominance all up that
[02:40:59.560 --> 02:41:06.200]  ladder of escalation and therefore because of this escalation dominance at every stage
[02:41:06.760 --> 02:41:13.640]  eventually we compelled uh uh cruised off to back down but let's look at those maps we totally
[02:41:13.640 --> 02:41:20.360]  destroy russia we just lose half our cities it's a period victory so in their ladder of dominance
[02:41:20.360 --> 02:41:28.840]  they win but america gets destroyed that is very sick well i think they believe they can
[02:41:28.840 --> 02:41:37.240]  get the russians to back down uh uh without it coming to that that again when cruised off looked
[02:41:37.240 --> 02:41:45.560]  at the icbm balance uh during the cuban missile crisis he concluded there was no way we could
[02:41:45.560 --> 02:41:52.200]  prevail here and he backed down so that's i believe the way the pentagon is looking at now
[02:41:52.200 --> 02:41:59.400]  from the perspective of a cons letter of escalation their uh doctrine of escalation dominance
[02:41:59.960 --> 02:42:06.200]  and shelling's uh uh game theory so this is this is next level russian or that with the whole world
[02:42:07.640 --> 02:42:14.200]  that's the way i see it yes and remember at the very height of the cuban missile crisis
[02:42:14.200 --> 02:42:24.280]  the cia set up a u2 over there uh over soviet union to provoke them uh the soviet shot it down
[02:42:24.840 --> 02:42:33.480]  and instead of overreacting kennedy continued with his back channel diplomacy with cruised off
[02:42:33.480 --> 02:42:40.840]  through his brother and ambassador don brenen uh saying quote there's always some son of a
[02:42:40.840 --> 02:42:49.560]  bitch down the line who doesn't get the word unquote so alex in this game of of russian roulette
[02:42:49.560 --> 02:42:54.840]  something can always go wrong someone does not get the word well that's right let's talk about
[02:42:54.840 --> 02:43:00.520]  how to end this peacefully thread head i'm taking a lot of supplements over the years since high

[02:47:05.160 --> 02:47:16.280]  just google its name dr francis they boil and find his dozens of amazing books
[02:47:16.280 --> 02:47:20.360]  you really know how the world works the last 10 and a half minutes segment we have here on this
[02:47:20.360 --> 02:47:26.520]  wednesday edition i want to talk about the nature of the anglo-american establishment
[02:47:27.080 --> 02:47:30.760]  and and what they're going to do next but i wanted to finish up with my questions with this
[02:47:30.760 --> 02:47:36.600]  we look at this escalation ladder that we know the pentagon still uses we know the rank corporation
[02:47:36.600 --> 02:47:41.880]  developed and that and that now is being quoted in the news once dr boil talked about it we move
[02:47:41.880 --> 02:47:46.680]  up here from one to 20 where we're at right now they're skipping ahead with some of the attacks
[02:47:46.680 --> 02:47:54.040]  inside russia 26 we move up into formal declaration of general war they're basically doing that now
[02:47:54.040 --> 02:48:03.160]  is a linsky visiting slow motion counter property war slow motion counter force war constrained
[02:48:03.160 --> 02:48:08.040]  force reduction salvo constrained disarming attack oh we just got an attack to stop their
[02:48:08.040 --> 02:48:15.800]  offensive counter force with abominance attack unmodified counter force attack and now they're
[02:48:15.800 --> 02:48:24.920]  really bad ones slow motion and it goes on with augmenting disarming attacks civilian devastation
[02:48:24.920 --> 02:48:31.560]  attack when they hit our cities some other kinds of control general war spasm of intense war we just
[02:48:31.560 --> 02:48:36.360]  nuke everything they nuke everything it just fire everything total insanity kind of into the world
[02:48:36.360 --> 02:48:41.560]  as we know it most estimates even say a limited nuclear war will cause a breakdown of civilization
[02:48:41.560 --> 02:48:45.960]  to kill billions a total nuclear war they think probably seven billion there'll be a billion
[02:48:45.960 --> 02:48:53.640]  people left maybe dr boil your comments on this ladder of escalation elix that's the pentagon's
[02:48:53.640 --> 02:49:01.640]  war plan for ukraine right now as we speak i believe that's their draft war plan and that's
[02:49:01.640 --> 02:49:09.000]  what they uh plan to do there at the pentagon uh and the bite knights will sign off on it moving
[02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:17.160]  up those stages of uh of escalation uh pursuant to their theory of uh uh escalation dominance
[02:49:17.160 --> 02:49:23.480]  that they have escalation dominance uh until the uh russians back down that that's the way
[02:49:23.480 --> 02:49:29.240]  they explain escalation dominance for folks that haven't studied this in layman's terms they believe
[02:49:29.240 --> 02:49:34.520]  every step of the of the escalation quote the us will be in charge in controlling it even though
[02:49:34.520 --> 02:49:38.520]  it'll be totally destructive to both sides they believe they're going to come out in the end on
[02:49:38.520 --> 02:49:43.880]  top which is what dr strange love is all about based on some real events and some real battle
[02:49:43.880 --> 02:49:49.240]  plans of where the pentagonic hurtle slayin limitzer tried to push a nuclear war to kennedy
[02:49:49.240 --> 02:49:54.120]  saying it'll be survivable yeah we'll lose 30 40 million americans but we'll win in the end
[02:49:54.120 --> 02:50:01.080]  and he said i'm not a mass murder alex you're basically right again i believe pursuant to
[02:50:01.080 --> 02:50:08.520]  their doctrine of uh escalation dominance which goes back to uh tom shelling ahead of me at uh harvard
[02:50:08.520 --> 02:50:17.400]  that they believe they control every uh uh wrong of that ladder of escalation you see there uh by
[02:50:17.400 --> 02:50:24.920]  con and that they believe that at some point uh the russians will back down and we will prevail
[02:50:24.920 --> 02:50:33.240]  one of the russians jump ahead one of the russians don't follow the ladder well hey very well might
[02:50:33.240 --> 02:50:42.120]  not alex i really don't know except my reading of the situation is that uh uh uh president
[02:50:42.120 --> 02:50:49.240]  putin and not to defend putin at all i've been up against putin too uh uh he's very cautious
[02:50:49.240 --> 02:51:00.600]  and moves one step at a time uh throughout this uh entire crisis starting uh with the overthrow
[02:51:00.600 --> 02:51:09.320]  of the democratically elected government of ukraine by obama and biden remember obama put
[02:51:09.320 --> 02:51:20.200]  biden in charge of the entire ukraine project and he has been in charge of it since then how do we
[02:51:20.200 --> 02:51:29.720]  stop this well i think alex what we have to do is to go back to the pledge that jim baker gave to
[02:51:29.720 --> 02:51:40.680]  uh uh soviet uh uh kamisar uh gorbachev namely that in return for gorbachev agreeing to the
[02:51:40.680 --> 02:51:49.480]  reunification of germany uh the nato would not move even one inch to the east that pledge was
[02:51:49.480 --> 02:51:57.080]  binding as a matter of international uh law even though it wasn't in writing and to his credit bush
[02:51:57.080 --> 02:52:04.920]  senior uh adhered to that pledge it was then clinton and the democrats who came into power
[02:52:05.480 --> 02:52:13.480]  and uh wantonly violated that pledge and let me point out here that the foreign policy uh guru
[02:52:14.040 --> 02:52:22.680]  and stengali for the democratic party has been brzezinski since the days of jimmy carter and
[02:52:22.680 --> 02:52:30.120]  indeed the jimmy carter campaign when he was uh head of the trilateral commission there uh paid
[02:52:30.120 --> 02:52:40.280]  for by david rockefeller and they co-opted uh carter into the presidency then bush jr under
[02:52:40.280 --> 02:52:49.400]  the influence of his neocons publicly stated they wanted ukraine and georgia uh to join uh nato
[02:52:49.400 --> 02:52:56.760]  this precipitated the uh war by russia sorry by georgia against russian peacekeepers in south
[02:52:56.760 --> 02:53:07.480]  asetia and then the current crisis uh in ukraine uh victoria newland the uh the infamous role uh
[02:53:07.480 --> 02:53:15.080]  that she played uh over there uh in promoting the coup d'etat and now she is biden's number three
[02:53:15.080 --> 02:53:22.200]  official in the state department so you know if you want proof that the neocons are in charge of
[02:53:22.200 --> 02:53:28.440]  what biden's doing uh new lung new let me ask you this why are we seeing the pope come out in the
[02:53:28.440 --> 02:53:33.960]  last six months three times and even kissinger three times putting last week saying we need a
[02:53:33.960 --> 02:53:39.160]  peace deal now this is a leading nuclear war this is out of control stop it when even kissinger who
[02:53:39.160 --> 02:53:45.080]  is like the omnibudsman of their new world order saying stop uh is that some faint by him or does
[02:53:45.080 --> 02:53:52.280]  he really mean that or why is he saying that well again i i think it's because they they're
[02:53:52.280 --> 02:53:59.000]  they have the same sources that i do and realize how existentially dangerous it is but to get back
[02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:07.320]  to how to end it then the united states government already promised that ukraine would not join nato
[02:54:07.320 --> 02:54:14.040]  no and that ukraine would remain new and then they sent and then they sent the kamala harris
[02:54:14.040 --> 02:54:20.760]  there two months ago to say oh they are going to join which is another provocation of course
[02:54:20.760 --> 02:54:27.000]  sure that's why uh zelensky came all the way over and they brought zelensky over here and gave them
[02:54:27.800 --> 02:54:35.400]  uh congress and all the mainstream news media uh to promote further escalation uh up that letter
[02:54:35.400 --> 02:54:43.240]  but to get back to my point it seems to me looking at the situation that if the united
[02:54:43.240 --> 02:54:50.600]  states government were to agree that uh ukraine would not join nato and could remain neutral
[02:54:51.160 --> 02:54:54.520]  that would be well that was put his only thing he asked for before he invaded
[02:54:55.720 --> 02:55:02.200]  you're right and as a matter of fact i've read the two treaties that uh russia tendered to the
[02:55:02.200 --> 02:55:11.560]  biden administration and to nato and the core uh obligation they wanted was a commitment in writing
[02:55:11.560 --> 02:55:20.360]  unlike this verbal commitment given to gorbachev that ukraine would not join nato and yet all the
[02:55:20.360 --> 02:55:29.960]  public sources uh indicate that the bidenites refused absolutely refused to negotiate this core
[02:55:29.960 --> 02:55:36.600]  demand let's close on this gut level for your children and grandchildren dr boil how about i mean
[02:55:36.600 --> 02:55:41.320]  a lot of mainline political analysts say greatest danger nuclear war ever i mean what what is your
[02:55:41.320 --> 02:55:49.080]  prognosis for the short and mid term right now well alex that's why i drafted my bill of impeachment
[02:55:49.080 --> 02:55:58.040]  against uh biden right now it is in circulation on capitol hill among the republican house freedom
[02:55:58.040 --> 02:56:06.840]  caucus one congressman i had a 30 minute uh discussion with he agreed fully with my analysis
[02:56:06.840 --> 02:56:15.720]  of the situation including the uh con uh ladder of escalation and said he was inclined to introduce
[02:56:15.720 --> 02:56:23.640]  my bill of impeachment uh into congress so we'll have to see what happens after january three
[02:56:23.640 --> 02:56:30.280]  but i think if if my bill and there'll be other bills uh being of impeachment introduced against
[02:56:30.280 --> 02:56:36.120]  biden indeed biden has hired an entire team of lawyers to deal with these bills of impeachment
[02:56:36.120 --> 02:56:44.120]  but if if my bill is introduced and passed i believe that will paralyze the biden administration
[02:56:44.120 --> 02:56:49.160]  they'll be dead in the water exactly and republicans can win major points to save the world
[02:56:49.160 --> 02:56:53.480]  but they won't because they're being financed by the same corporations i think they can survive
[02:56:53.480 --> 02:56:58.120]  a nuclear war this is just total madness because let's not let's not blame it all on democrats
[02:56:58.120 --> 02:57:02.280]  that oh you're not the republicans are just going along with this because they're bought off too
[02:57:04.040 --> 02:57:08.760]  well there were large numbers of republicans and i'm a political independent house there
[02:57:08.760 --> 02:57:14.680]  were large numbers of republicans who did not show up for the no no no i agree the republicans
[02:57:14.680 --> 02:57:18.520]  are by the democrats i'm just saying some of the republican leadership is going along with this
[02:57:18.520 --> 02:57:22.600]  because they could they could get the impeachment going right now they have the house and you know
[02:57:22.600 --> 02:57:27.000]  jim jordan's saying oh we're thinking about hearings on big tech censorship you're thinking
[02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:33.960]  about it i mean right no i mean this is long beyond the stage of thinking about anything
[02:57:33.960 --> 02:57:39.480]  we have to uh have the house pass a bill of impeachment send it right away to the senate
[02:57:39.480 --> 02:57:43.160]  for a trial dr boy i know you're gonna go two minute break come back and finish up with closing

[03:00:03.880 --> 03:00:08.840]  resisting medical tyranny why the covet nineteen mandates are criminal very important book by
[03:00:08.840 --> 03:00:13.960]  dr francis a boyle find it on amazon dot com you name it i want him to finish up with that in the
[03:00:13.960 --> 03:00:19.880]  last five minutes but also it's on info wars dot com lavaros says the pentagon is now directly
[03:00:19.880 --> 03:00:25.320]  threatening to assassinate with decapitation attacks inside moscow or other areas saying that
[03:00:25.320 --> 03:00:33.480]  would lead to open war we know that uh what we've had to us senators democrats from republicans calling
[03:00:33.480 --> 03:00:39.960]  for this just mad level escalation can you speak to that in closing dr boyle and then to your book
[03:00:39.960 --> 03:00:47.000]  dealing with the medical tyranny sure calling for the assassination of head of state is an
[03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:54.520]  international crime so of course the russians take this very seriously and if an attempt
[03:00:54.520 --> 03:01:03.720]  were to be made by our ukrainian proxies using gps satellite guidance by us
[03:01:05.080 --> 03:01:10.600]  the game would be over at that point sure and when lindsey graham and a bunch of them
[03:01:10.600 --> 03:01:14.040]  have been making the threats publicly what do you make of lavaros saying the pentagon is openly
[03:01:14.040 --> 03:01:19.480]  telling him you better back off we're getting directives to kill putin i mean this just sounds
[03:01:19.480 --> 03:01:27.560]  totally insane right we're moving up that uh uh ladder of escalation sure um but i mean
[03:01:28.600 --> 03:01:33.800]  that lindsey graham speaks for himself i mean we all know he's a joke or fraud so fine
[03:01:35.880 --> 03:01:39.400]  these are crazy people talk about medical tyranny in your book because they're trying
[03:01:39.400 --> 03:01:42.760]  to come back with new lockdowns more forced injections we've got to get ahead of this
[03:01:42.760 --> 03:01:56.600]  well again sure the this is what the who uh uh treaty uh and the wha regulations are all about
[03:01:57.240 --> 03:02:05.240]  there will be no into this the the next pandemic is coming out of their biological warfare weapons
[03:02:05.240 --> 03:02:13.560]  programs and labs and they know it and so they are planning for the next big one uh to keep us
[03:02:13.560 --> 03:02:22.280]  all under control and under the domination of the who uh bill gates big pharma the bio warfare
[03:02:22.280 --> 03:02:29.800]  industry and the uh chinese communist government which by the way if you read today's newspapers
[03:02:29.800 --> 03:02:35.880]  you will see the chinese communist government is now going to let out everyone from china
[03:02:36.840 --> 03:02:44.600]  with their current covet nineteen uh variant which i believe is like amicron b7 that that
[03:02:44.600 --> 03:02:52.200]  is not prevalent here to travel all over the world and see the world with this newest variant of
[03:02:52.200 --> 03:02:59.960]  uh opacron uh i guess their calculation is well we're suffering from it so uh misery let's company
[03:02:59.960 --> 03:03:05.320]  let's uh share it or i totally agree and we know they had thousands of variants just of this weaponized
[03:03:05.320 --> 03:03:10.040]  covet how do we know they or the deep state hasn't released a new variant that's even more deadly we
[03:03:10.040 --> 03:03:15.000]  know major universities like boston medical university created one that kills 80 percent of
[03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:23.480]  humanized mice right i was uh involved in the lawsuit that tried to uh stop that uh bsl for
[03:03:24.040 --> 03:03:31.480]  from being put in there at uh boston university in doorchester which is at that time was primarily
[03:03:31.480 --> 03:03:40.520]  an african-american community basically uh uh environmental racism and uh and genocide right
[03:03:40.520 --> 03:03:52.280]  if you look at for example uh b a five uh it has 50 50 mutations uh beyond its predecessor
[03:03:52.280 --> 03:03:59.720]  which to me seems to indicate it came out of a biological warfare weapons lab likewise uh monkey
[03:03:59.720 --> 03:04:10.360]  pox had 30 genetic mutations beyond wild type uh monkey pox so again it seemed to me that came out
[03:04:10.360 --> 03:04:17.320]  of someone's biological warfare weapons program alex it's a matter of public record that the
[03:04:17.320 --> 03:04:26.680]  central intelligence agency has its own stockpile of smallpox uh that came out in uh uh hearings uh
[03:04:26.680 --> 03:04:34.920]  many uh years ago after nixon gave the order to destroy it and the cia said well okay we're just
[03:04:34.920 --> 03:04:42.440]  going to move it to a new uh uh warehouse so yes a big a big one could be coming even bigger than
[03:04:42.440 --> 03:04:49.080]  covet 19 unless we stop these people correct truly mad scientist dr boil thank you so much for the

[03:06:07.160 --> 03:06:13.000]  from k deli radio.com i want to share a lot with you today and some of it's not going to be politics
[03:06:13.000 --> 03:06:17.080]  it's not going to be in that direction but i want to talk about how to get through what's coming
[03:06:17.080 --> 03:06:22.280]  a little bit more today than what's coming and so much has been covered even in this last hour
[03:06:22.920 --> 03:06:29.480]  with alex that i want to start here i look like a giant snowflake today this is my favorite
[03:06:29.480 --> 03:06:35.880]  ski sweater right it was rainy where i'm at and and so wintery we remember that season winter
[03:06:35.880 --> 03:06:40.680]  that we always have yeah that one anyway i know they're making a really big deal out of winter
[03:06:40.680 --> 03:06:47.480]  right now but you know it comes every fourth season like forever like in history and um
[03:06:47.480 --> 03:06:52.120]  they're acting like we've never been through one and um we need the national guard to help us out
[03:06:52.120 --> 03:06:57.960]  right buffalo and uh we don't know how to handle it so weather seems to be what they want us to focus
[03:06:57.960 --> 03:07:05.880]  on and not election fraud the coup in the white house hormala king fraud a lot or whatever version
[03:07:05.880 --> 03:07:14.040]  of uh king biden shows up that day um the money laundering in ukraine the uh cia the fbi showing
[03:07:14.040 --> 03:07:20.840]  how corrupt they are the border problems the money printing the insane amount of criminality going on
[03:07:20.840 --> 03:07:27.720]  on elected officials right both local state and then of course federal expected and uh the unit
[03:07:27.720 --> 03:07:32.840]  party in washington dc that just furthers the ball you know furthers the goal line and uh never
[03:07:32.840 --> 03:07:39.400]  really changes anything but just keeps going right washington dc stabbing you in the back acting
[03:07:39.400 --> 03:07:44.040]  like they're gonna do something uh and then they don't it's like the big fake and you're supposed
[03:07:44.040 --> 03:07:51.080]  to ignore all of that and then talk about the weather because it's winter and they keep calling it
[03:07:51.080 --> 03:07:56.920]  the snowpocalypse and how are you going to get through it in one piece oh my gosh be afraid
[03:07:56.920 --> 03:08:06.840]  be very very afraid um yeah it's uh freaking winter anyways um so uh buffalo gets the national guard
[03:08:06.840 --> 03:08:12.120]  right on tap to show them how to drive in winter in snow and ice because they must not know how
[03:08:12.680 --> 03:08:16.600]  i guess after living there for the ages most people just don't know how that are our age
[03:08:16.600 --> 03:08:21.800]  oh whatever okay so you have that and you shouldn't fly don't fly because your flight's
[03:08:21.800 --> 03:08:26.200]  going to get canceled because we've never flown in snow and ice before and it's winter so flights
[03:08:26.200 --> 03:08:31.080]  have never been canceled before in history oh yeah that's that's right they have every year
[03:08:31.080 --> 03:08:37.640]  and anyway never mind you can't fly oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh and of course the big headline
[03:08:37.640 --> 03:08:47.560]  of the day global jitters global jitters for below vid um with 98 symptoms 98 symptoms of flu and cold
[03:08:49.240 --> 03:08:55.160]  how are we going to deal with this and still stay in one piece because it's so insane right it's so
[03:08:55.160 --> 03:09:00.200]  crazy but i want to talk to you a little bit about weather worship and then i also want to share some
[03:09:00.200 --> 03:09:05.000]  personal things about my life today with you because uh maybe there's something there that can
[03:09:05.000 --> 03:09:10.040]  help somebody out there to kind of get through what's coming and really and truly we got to get
[03:09:10.040 --> 03:09:16.040]  through it together and how are we going to do that and so i want to start off today by sharing
[03:09:16.040 --> 03:09:23.160]  something very very serious and that is the change in the drug remdesivir too many people were going
[03:09:23.160 --> 03:09:28.680]  in and uh they were saying remdesivir and of course too many people have heard about remdesivir
[03:09:29.400 --> 03:09:34.680]  and uh i know they would have likely killed my husband with it um a year and a half ago
[03:09:34.680 --> 03:09:40.120]  and they changed up the name the name is now vexlery okay and you probably heard about this on
[03:09:40.120 --> 03:09:45.240]  the alex jones show i'm sure vexlery is the new name they're calling it because it's the brand name
[03:09:45.240 --> 03:09:53.640]  of remdesivir so they just switch names okay and uh they also are driving home this rsv thing the rsv
[03:09:53.640 --> 03:10:01.000]  thing is it's ridiculous and people i honestly people that think they know they're they're very
[03:10:01.000 --> 03:10:05.640]  awake they'll go yeah but it's the babies this this is this is a serious thing this is very serious
[03:10:07.000 --> 03:10:13.560]  100 to 300 babies die every single year and they have for decades because of pneumonia
[03:10:13.560 --> 03:10:20.680]  running amok just like in the small percentage of adults that that happens too as well okay
[03:10:21.400 --> 03:10:27.800]  and what they did was they approved remdesivir vexlery they approved this from gilead
[03:10:27.800 --> 03:10:33.400]  you know where everybody's profiting like fake g okay um everybody's profiting off these drugs
[03:10:33.400 --> 03:10:39.480]  and uh and so what they did was basically they're they're saying well now that we've approved this
[03:10:39.480 --> 03:10:45.880]  drug uh the hospitals are pretty much begging you at this point to bring in your newborn with
[03:10:45.880 --> 03:10:53.960]  the slightest sniffle now there is a test for rsv which is just respiratory but they don't they
[03:10:53.960 --> 03:10:58.760]  don't do that test a lot and i don't even think the test is actually very accurate at all because
[03:10:58.760 --> 03:11:03.400]  it's really just testing for symptoms what they do is they say if the baby's having trouble breathing
[03:11:03.400 --> 03:11:09.720]  then of course they have rsv and the parents go rsv you mean the thing we heard about in the media
[03:11:09.720 --> 03:11:15.000]  you know my baby's going to die right because we've been munchausen by government so everybody
[03:11:15.000 --> 03:11:21.800]  thinks that they're the next person to die but actually actually it's uh it goes into the lungs
[03:11:21.800 --> 03:11:27.160]  and you can help this out and most babies are not going to die and most adults are not going to die
[03:11:27.160 --> 03:11:32.360]  from this but we all think we're vulnerable now because the media has made us total hypochondriacs
[03:11:32.360 --> 03:11:38.280]  and i'm thinking that we're going to so i just wanted to run that by everybody they approved
[03:11:38.280 --> 03:11:44.600]  remdesivir vexlery which is the brand name for remdesivir they approved it in the summertime
[03:11:44.600 --> 03:11:50.200]  and now all of a sudden rsv is on the rise and you better get your your baby into the hospital
[03:11:50.200 --> 03:11:57.080]  asap it's absolutely asinine and i just hope that people realize and can understand that this is
[03:11:57.080 --> 03:12:05.320]  this is all it is a lot of hype a lot of hype so um let's take a break from politics and i want to
[03:12:05.320 --> 03:12:11.000]  talk about life a little bit the movie babelon came out and i want to reference this because
[03:12:12.760 --> 03:12:18.200]  interview with the executive producer founder of the chosen so i want to kind of talk about
[03:12:18.200 --> 03:12:25.960]  hollywood for just a moment and set the stage a little bit um we we get the movie babelon and
[03:12:25.960 --> 03:12:30.440]  it's tanking at the box office and i absolutely love that it's tanking why do i love that it's
[03:12:30.440 --> 03:12:36.840]  tanking because for three years right we've done nothing really i mean we've we've tried to get
[03:12:36.840 --> 03:12:41.000]  back on our feet from the loss of business and everything else and lockdowns and everything
[03:12:41.000 --> 03:12:46.200]  they've tried to do to us but we've watched a lot of netflix we've watched a lot of movies we've watched
[03:12:46.200 --> 03:12:53.800]  a lot of hollywood's offerings okay and we've suddenly realized i think as a nation pretty much
[03:12:53.800 --> 03:13:00.200]  that what they have to sell you is complete crap and that these people can barely act and that
[03:13:00.200 --> 03:13:06.200]  they're selling you so many woke variations of narratives that you don't want to see it anymore
[03:13:06.200 --> 03:13:10.680]  you don't want to watch it anymore so these movies are virtually just tanking at the box office
[03:13:11.320 --> 03:13:16.920]  babelon wants to try to tell you that all the debauchery all of the the crap in hollywood
[03:13:16.920 --> 03:13:21.480]  happened in the 20s and now they've they've devolved into this wonderful responsible
[03:13:21.480 --> 03:13:28.440]  hollywood that looks back into the 20s and goes ew no that is hello it's so evil now
[03:13:28.440 --> 03:13:33.800]  it's so on steroids and it's such a distraction because they want you to look here instead of
[03:13:33.800 --> 03:13:39.240]  looking here they want you to see something in hollywood that happened a long time ago
[03:13:39.880 --> 03:13:44.920]  that's not happening now of course of course not because they have well they've really
[03:13:44.920 --> 03:13:51.480]  devolved really but they think they've evolved into these wonderful hollywood executives and these
[03:13:51.480 --> 03:13:57.560]  wonderful hollywood people so they're trying to show you what 20s hollywood look like calling it
[03:13:57.560 --> 03:14:04.440]  babelon well it's tanking it's absolutely tanking it's gross it's disgusting and they show scenes
[03:14:04.440 --> 03:14:09.720]  of just pure disgust and one reviewer said that he just wanted to take a shower after watching it
[03:14:09.720 --> 03:14:17.160]  because it was so disgusting on the other hand we have the chosen right depicts the life of christ
[03:14:17.160 --> 03:14:21.560]  shows him as a person shows him shows the apostles as people shows all the struggles
[03:14:21.560 --> 03:14:28.200]  they went through and everything that they were doing and we were so desperate for good entertainment
[03:14:28.200 --> 03:14:37.960]  it is the largest crowd-funded series in history we were so desperate to see something that didn't
[03:14:37.960 --> 03:14:45.640]  that didn't leave us feeling empty right and disgusted right we wanted the chosen
[03:14:46.360 --> 03:14:53.800]  the chosen grabbed more money and we're able to put on the better actors the scenes are great
[03:14:53.800 --> 03:14:59.480]  the costuming is great you can tell that this was done carefully it was done with a lot of faith
[03:14:59.480 --> 03:15:05.080]  and i think this is a wonderful series and it's a series that people are actually saying you know
[03:15:05.080 --> 03:15:10.120]  what i saw it on tv but i'll even pay extra and go to the movies and watch it and guess what folks
[03:15:10.120 --> 03:15:17.000]  it was sold out it was sold out in uh in in the theaters in my state you couldn't even get tickets
[03:15:17.000 --> 03:15:22.920]  for a while that is crazy think about that for just a moment hollywood always dominates right
[03:15:23.720 --> 03:15:30.840]  um but not now not after we got three years of their crappola offerings did we realize that
[03:15:30.840 --> 03:15:39.160]  oh my gosh hollywood is there to sell us wokeness and a fest a total feast should we say a festival of
[03:15:41.080 --> 03:15:44.760]  when i come back i want to talk a little bit more about that and i want to talk about
[03:15:44.760 --> 03:15:48.760]  a movie i watched and then i also want to share some things about my life i'll be right back
[03:15:48.760 --> 03:15:52.440]  on the alex jones show i'm kate deli your guest host for the hour be right back
[03:15:52.440 --> 03:16:04.760]  i have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the globalist i have come from nowhere
[03:16:05.400 --> 03:16:11.480]  to the very heights of politics not just in america but the world we are engaging the globalist

[03:20:05.080 --> 03:20:15.720]  back here with you on the alex jones show i'm kate dally your guest host for the hour
[03:20:16.280 --> 03:20:20.280]  i want to bring up some things about my life i want to bring up some things that i i don't
[03:20:20.280 --> 03:20:27.640]  talk about a lot and then i also want to share um hollywood a little bit uh the take on hollywood
[03:20:27.640 --> 03:20:33.720]  for just a second because honestly does it shape our lives yeah it does the movies shape our lives
[03:20:33.720 --> 03:20:39.640]  i was watching x files and i was noticing how many plots they were nailing accurately
[03:20:40.440 --> 03:20:44.520]  for the future of what we're dealing with right now and when we talk about predictive
[03:20:44.520 --> 03:20:50.040]  programming and we talk about revelation of method those are all aspects of telling us what
[03:20:50.040 --> 03:20:56.520]  they're going to do in the future and um making us very aware of it so they don't have the
[03:20:56.520 --> 03:21:04.520]  responsibility of telling us and then we're basically agreeing to all of this who knows but uh i i do
[03:21:04.520 --> 03:21:11.160]  find it kind of interesting um so let me let me say this i never ever want to not notice that was
[03:21:11.160 --> 03:21:17.800]  a really strange sentence not notice the the good things okay and i think one of the good things
[03:21:17.800 --> 03:21:25.560]  is that the chosen was the biggest crowd funded series to hit i think that's huge i think it's
[03:21:25.560 --> 03:21:31.320]  important to realize that because i think that's something very very good standing in in sort of
[03:21:31.320 --> 03:21:38.040]  the bleakness of what is going on in the world right the theater the total theater there's much
[03:21:38.040 --> 03:21:44.920]  more theater than people even realize and so when i'm looking at at at the evolution of just that
[03:21:44.920 --> 03:21:51.400]  20 years ago i don't think people would have clamored for that kind of entertainment and
[03:21:51.400 --> 03:21:56.840]  i don't think people would have invested their own money to provide their the the entertainment
[03:21:56.840 --> 03:22:00.840]  they they wanted because what did we do we relied on hollywood to serve it up for us
[03:22:01.480 --> 03:22:06.840]  and then we realize what a place of debauchery that is you know you have your brad pit movies
[03:22:06.840 --> 03:22:12.200]  and when brad pit does a movie i just roll my eyes because he's almost a clownish cartoon of himself
[03:22:12.760 --> 03:22:18.920]  when he's acting and uh if if you want to call it that and all of these actors all of these people
[03:22:18.920 --> 03:22:24.360]  in hollywood all have the same values all have the same beliefs how does that happen are they
[03:22:24.360 --> 03:22:30.280]  bought do they sell their souls what do they do to get into a a place like that where they're
[03:22:30.280 --> 03:22:35.960]  willing to sell you the same junk over and over yellowstone huge series right big series
[03:22:36.520 --> 03:22:45.240]  on yet what does it do it has like the beth in the series right and and she's just gross a gross
[03:22:45.240 --> 03:22:51.400]  version of a woman right but what are they trying to do they're trying to kind of take hollywood
[03:22:51.400 --> 03:22:57.080]  and put it into the old west and we're eating it up because we actually want to see the old west
[03:22:57.080 --> 03:23:02.360]  we actually want to see property and the fights over property and all of these things that made
[03:23:02.360 --> 03:23:07.960]  america what america is right now property ownership right but but the problem is is
[03:23:07.960 --> 03:23:14.120]  that they serve us up all this junk within all of that i wish the chosen executive producers
[03:23:14.120 --> 03:23:18.520]  would do their own version of yellowstone i bet it would be more accurate and less beth
[03:23:19.080 --> 03:23:24.840]  to be honest with you um when i think of womanhood beth is on the opposite end of the scale
[03:23:24.840 --> 03:23:29.720]  and so i was uh i was talking to the executive producer of the chosen and i was saying wow this
[03:23:29.720 --> 03:23:33.800]  is a really neat thing that this has happened and they were saying you know what we just put a
[03:23:33.800 --> 03:23:39.560]  little faith in it and voila we've got this series and it just keeps getting better and better
[03:23:39.560 --> 03:23:45.640]  and how excited they were to see how people responded to it and my answer to that was my gosh
[03:23:45.640 --> 03:23:50.360]  you can tell the temperature of this nation and the goodness of the people because we know that
[03:23:50.360 --> 03:23:57.000]  the majority of the people want to see good messages or it doesn't make them feel empty and
[03:23:57.720 --> 03:24:02.440]  you know just gross afterwards like the movie babelon no one's wanting to see babelon they're
[03:24:02.440 --> 03:24:06.840]  going to totally take a nose dive just like they have all of the other little superhero
[03:24:06.840 --> 03:24:11.880]  movies that they've done and superhero movies are even tanking now they're worried because people are
[03:24:11.880 --> 03:24:17.240]  not wanting to see it anymore they've just they won't come up with new plots they run the same
[03:24:17.240 --> 03:24:23.160]  plots and it's just gross bad scripts bad plots bad acting okay by woke people who we don't want
[03:24:23.160 --> 03:24:26.920]  to hear from because we could care less what they think about politics if i want to know about
[03:24:26.920 --> 03:24:31.640]  politics the last person on earth i'm going to go to is robert deniro or meryl streep okay
[03:24:31.640 --> 03:24:37.320]  and i can't even watch their movies anymore so then we had netflix right and over the holidays
[03:24:37.320 --> 03:24:42.680]  you probably watched a lot of movies sitting in the snow or sitting in your weather that's winter
[03:24:44.200 --> 03:24:50.760]  oh my gosh they can dramatize winter like no other anyway so we've got this movie and it and it has
[03:24:50.760 --> 03:24:56.920]  this very metrosexual male as the lead acts like a five-year-old and is really unappealing there's
[03:24:56.920 --> 03:25:04.520]  nothing worse than a metrosexual male i can't i like uh i like uh men to be men okay and so you've
[03:25:04.520 --> 03:25:09.320]  got this metrosexual male that no woman would find appealing and they've got him as the lead of this
[03:25:09.320 --> 03:25:15.080]  movie and the whole movie premises he's like a five-year-old and how the woman had to embrace
[03:25:15.080 --> 03:25:20.920]  this five-year-old as a grown man and she finally does at the end of the movie there's zero chemistry
[03:25:20.920 --> 03:25:26.600]  because he's so metrosexual it's just honestly scary and i'm watching this movie but the whole
[03:25:26.600 --> 03:25:32.360]  movie was about weather it was about um sledding and it was about christmas and it was about it was
[03:25:32.360 --> 03:25:38.040]  about um just snow and um seeing the nutcracker not one mentioned about christ not one mentioned
[03:25:38.040 --> 03:25:42.920]  about christmas it was really weird and i thought you could get through a whole movie about christmas
[03:25:42.920 --> 03:25:46.920]  and how amazing christmas is and never even mentioned the meaning and i just thought it was
[03:25:46.920 --> 03:25:52.440]  another bizarre take from hollywood doing their thing hallmark goes completely and totally woke
[03:25:52.440 --> 03:25:57.480]  right they even condemn kandace kandace ends up leaving kandace beer just for saying that
[03:25:57.480 --> 03:26:03.800]  traditional marriage is something that you know is real and good what's really strange is that most
[03:26:03.800 --> 03:26:08.840]  of the hollywood actors honestly came from traditional homes that's how they were that's
[03:26:08.840 --> 03:26:14.280]  how they're here today yet they're quick to condemn it and they're quick to say that that
[03:26:14.280 --> 03:26:22.040]  isn't inclusive enough it's crazy and then you've got uh you've got all of this hollywood crap right
[03:26:22.040 --> 03:26:26.680]  and it's it's getting into our our homes and it's telling us how to think and it's telling us what
[03:26:26.680 --> 03:26:32.120]  to what to worship what to believe in and then of course you have the wednesday show that's
[03:26:32.120 --> 03:26:38.440]  really popular right now and it's very goth it's very dark it's very suicide and it's a very subtle
[03:26:38.440 --> 03:26:46.120]  shadow um lgbtq pairing of these two girls that they don't overtly come out and say it but it's
[03:26:46.120 --> 03:26:53.880]  pretty much assumed and that's why they're icons for that group and it's amazing to watch this become
[03:26:53.880 --> 03:27:00.760]  the most popular thing to watch in in our lives right now is it not you've got yellowstone which
[03:27:00.760 --> 03:27:05.720]  is pretty foul i actually like yellowstone for some reasons but pretty foul okay and then you've
[03:27:05.720 --> 03:27:14.200]  got the bath and then you've got the woke undertones underneath the storylines and we're supposed
[03:27:14.200 --> 03:27:18.600]  to come out of this after devouring this and watching this and staying home and watching
[03:27:18.600 --> 03:27:24.920]  movies because it's the entertainment of the day and we're supposed to make choices to help this
[03:27:24.920 --> 03:27:33.080]  country to save the constitution to to to really kind of be these these great people after watching
[03:27:33.080 --> 03:27:38.920]  this kind of crap 24 7 and everybody on on social media was saying yeah i'm staying home i'm watching
[03:27:38.920 --> 03:27:44.920]  movies what are we watching right um and so that's why i wanted to bring up the shows i wanted to
[03:27:44.920 --> 03:27:49.960]  bring up the good parts the the things that are are being represented that you can watch that are
[03:27:49.960 --> 03:27:54.680]  good that are um a little more wholesome that are a little better you're going to feel a little more
[03:27:54.680 --> 03:28:01.000]  inspired after you watch these things then you will wednesday or babalon i mean look at the names
[03:28:01.000 --> 03:28:08.040]  even or babalon or any of the woke uh holiday fair that they've got out there it's it's really
[03:28:08.040 --> 03:28:14.520]  bizarre and so it's empty and i and i wanted to talk about the show ponies the show ponies like
[03:28:14.520 --> 03:28:19.240]  the kardashians you know that what are they good at nothing they want you to dress like them and
[03:28:19.240 --> 03:28:23.000]  look like them and they don't even know what they want to look like so they keep changing their faces
[03:28:23.000 --> 03:28:28.600]  every two seconds compare a family photo from 2005 and they don't look like the same family
[03:28:29.160 --> 03:28:33.160]  it is bizarre and i call them the show ponies because that's really what they're out they're
[03:28:33.160 --> 03:28:37.960]  out to pimp products and that's it and there's no talent there it's kind of like the mascot for
[03:28:37.960 --> 03:28:43.800]  hollywood was when i think of the kardashians it's the mascot it's empty it's grotesque but they
[03:28:43.800 --> 03:28:48.760]  sell it they certainly sell it when i come back i want to tell you a little bit about my life i'll

[03:33:01.720 --> 03:33:14.360]  world order it's alex jones welcome back to the alex jones show i'm kate deli your guest
[03:33:14.360 --> 03:33:19.800]  host for the hour look i'm talking about hollywood i'm talking about the media because we're all
[03:33:19.800 --> 03:33:25.560]  absorbing it 24 hours a day even though we don't want to admit it it's just in our faces 24 7
[03:33:25.560 --> 03:33:30.920]  doesn't matter where you go the airport everything's playing the narrative 24 7 and so that's why i
[03:33:30.920 --> 03:33:35.720]  wanted to talk about that a little bit today and just about getting through this um and realizing
[03:33:35.720 --> 03:33:40.600]  how many good things there are too and what we're doing as a populace we're creating our own
[03:33:40.600 --> 03:33:46.520]  entertainment we're funding our own entertainment the only place for hollywood to go now is to think
[03:33:46.520 --> 03:33:54.200]  about this this is so important is to showcase pedophilia as good normalize it and sell you on magic
[03:33:54.200 --> 03:33:59.480]  and witchcraft that's all they've got left okay it's the only other cards they can play except
[03:33:59.480 --> 03:34:03.160]  for maybe just straight up murder murdering each other which they already have they've already
[03:34:03.160 --> 03:34:09.480]  gone there but i'm talking about really selling it as goodness trying to sell it as some as good
[03:34:09.480 --> 03:34:16.360]  ideas okay and they will this is the only direction they have left they want to sell you on
[03:34:16.360 --> 03:34:23.480]  evil and debauchery so the only thing we can do is to abandon it is to turn it off and take away
[03:34:23.480 --> 03:34:28.440]  their power the power of hollywood the only reason they've got powers because eyeballs are on them
[03:34:28.440 --> 03:34:33.640]  take away the eyeballs it's really that simple we just don't think about it in those terms because
[03:34:33.640 --> 03:34:40.520]  we're so used to going to the movies we're so used to taking in three or four hours let's be honest
[03:34:40.520 --> 03:34:45.960]  tv shows a night because we want to escape from all the stuff that we know is going on
[03:34:45.960 --> 03:34:50.920]  the stuff that we know is happening and so it's the only escape we have but if we can turn that
[03:34:50.920 --> 03:34:55.800]  off or turn on something better that we can feel inspired by that would actually help us
[03:34:56.360 --> 03:35:02.360]  to get through all of this how great would that be and most of america believe it or not the majority
[03:35:02.360 --> 03:35:09.400]  of america wants that they don't want this crap fest that we're sold you know news is just now a
[03:35:09.400 --> 03:35:14.760]  caricature of itself and it has been for decades but it's getting so much worse and i was reading a
[03:35:14.760 --> 03:35:19.880]  story from nbc before i get into a story about my life i just wanted to talk about cassidy hutchinson
[03:35:19.880 --> 03:35:26.120]  cassidy with a why anyway cassidy hutchinson there was an article nbc put out and i just want to
[03:35:26.840 --> 03:35:31.880]  i just want to give this the dramatic reading it deserves okay because now the ap they're
[03:35:31.880 --> 03:35:36.920]  novelists okay and they're selling you so much spin that i can't find the news story
[03:35:36.920 --> 03:35:42.600]  within the spin that's important to know cassidy hutchinson knew she was going to be
[03:35:42.600 --> 03:35:49.640]  nuked for turning on trump is the headline period she did it anyway oh what a hero um
[03:35:49.640 --> 03:35:55.160]  cassidy hutchinson sped out of washington in the wee hours of the morning while googling
[03:35:55.160 --> 03:36:01.080]  watergate on her phone frantically looking for some kind of guidance on how to be a whistleblower
[03:36:01.080 --> 03:36:07.080]  oh she's a rower wow until that moment the former donald trump white house not president donald
[03:36:07.080 --> 03:36:13.000]  trump just the donald trump white house aid would go on to be the star witness of the house select
[03:36:13.000 --> 03:36:21.240]  committee investigating the january 6 insurrection i'd still like to see the the photos of the 140
[03:36:21.240 --> 03:36:25.800]  cops that were you know attacked right because that would never happen in america they'd shoot
[03:36:25.800 --> 03:36:31.640]  you if you tried to attack an officer um had remained loyal and quote unquote in the family
[03:36:31.640 --> 03:36:36.120]  you're supposed to cue the mafia right now think of an image of the mafia that's what they wanted
[03:36:36.120 --> 03:36:43.080]  you to do right there as trump world insiders kept reminding her okay it literally goes on the story
[03:36:43.080 --> 03:36:48.600]  gets much worse in in the way of adjectives but it goes on to say on the night before she fled for
[03:36:48.600 --> 03:36:54.200]  her parents house in new jersey hutchinson said she had a mental breakdown and here we go as the
[03:36:54.200 --> 03:37:00.440]  moral crisis she had been grappling with came to a head pushing her to make a decision because
[03:37:00.440 --> 03:37:07.160]  that would i'm sorry that would change the course of the investigation into the 2021 attack on the
[03:37:07.160 --> 03:37:15.080]  capital these script writers they're hollywood writers and our news is giving given to us in a
[03:37:15.080 --> 03:37:21.320]  caricature of itself there's so many adjectives and so much narrative in this article to prop up
[03:37:21.320 --> 03:37:28.520]  cassidy with a why into some sort of moral hero that it's it's that disgusting in fact in the
[03:37:28.520 --> 03:37:33.480]  entire article they never really tell you what was so important that made her a hero of course
[03:37:34.120 --> 03:37:41.480]  just that she was one i just wanted you to believe it this is nbc it's so ridiculous it's become
[03:37:42.360 --> 03:37:49.560]  a caricature of news it's not even just spin anymore it's far beyond that and when i was reading
[03:37:49.560 --> 03:37:53.320]  that you have to get rid of the rest of it because you're just so blown away they never really tell
[03:37:53.320 --> 03:38:00.120]  you what made her a hero just that it's laden with adjectives to convince you that she is
[03:38:00.680 --> 03:38:06.600]  they're so desperate you know in my life i want to share this with you because when i talk about
[03:38:07.160 --> 03:38:14.120]  making good choices and standing up for for what's right i've had obviously in all of our
[03:38:14.120 --> 03:38:18.920]  lives we've had moments of good we've had moments of bad and true moments of standing
[03:38:18.920 --> 03:38:26.840]  but i was on a uh i was on a uh a fox news affiliate channel and i was uh fired because
[03:38:26.840 --> 03:38:32.280]  i kept talking about the records of both sides of the aisle the unit party in washington and
[03:38:32.280 --> 03:38:37.320]  i got so tired of interviewing politicians and i interviewed so many of them and i couldn't
[03:38:37.320 --> 03:38:42.760]  stand it anymore i just couldn't because it was just fluffery i remember uh interviewing hatch
[03:38:42.760 --> 03:38:49.000]  and uh he was literally crumpling up paper and acting like the line was bad because we talked
[03:38:49.000 --> 03:38:54.920]  about the ndaa and he said kata just because it's written doesn't mean i'm gonna use it okay that
[03:38:54.920 --> 03:39:00.520]  doesn't mean we're gonna use it it's just written and i was i was expected to believe that and move
[03:39:00.520 --> 03:39:05.640]  on and and there was a lot of politicians that i had to interview and just get through the interview
[03:39:05.640 --> 03:39:11.560]  and after the interview i was just abhorred by by what we talked about which was basically
[03:39:11.560 --> 03:39:17.080]  fluff it was nothing they wouldn't answer anything and this is why they stay in office for years on
[03:39:17.080 --> 03:39:21.320]  both sides of the aisle and i will agree that there's one side really wanting to destroy this
[03:39:21.320 --> 03:39:26.600]  country but the other side pretends they don't want to but they're kind of all aboard for the most part
[03:39:27.400 --> 03:39:33.160]  and uh and so i was fired well a lot of people started making phone calls they wanted the show
[03:39:33.160 --> 03:39:39.080]  back and and i was eventually offered the job back but i knew at that point that i should go on my
[03:39:39.080 --> 03:39:44.200]  own and that i should skip taking a paycheck and that i should not worry about the money
[03:39:44.200 --> 03:39:48.440]  and i'm going to tell you it wasn't easy i want to say oh gosh that was so easy and i just you
[03:39:48.440 --> 03:39:53.720]  know went on faith and wow was no it was really hard because we needed that at the time we were
[03:39:53.720 --> 03:39:58.040]  counting on that just like all of you you're counting on the spouse's paycheck or your paycheck
[03:39:58.040 --> 03:40:02.760]  and it would be very difficult right now to sort of walk off a cliff or a ledge and say okay well i
[03:40:02.760 --> 03:40:08.440]  guess i guess i'll do the right thing and go on my own and say you know this is how it's gonna
[03:40:08.440 --> 03:40:14.040]  this is how it's gonna work out um and i'm just gonna hope for the best but you know as soon as
[03:40:14.040 --> 03:40:18.920]  i did that as soon as i took that leave it was really amazing because all of a sudden people
[03:40:18.920 --> 03:40:24.280]  were put into my life at that particular moment that wanted to help me didn't even know me didn't
[03:40:24.280 --> 03:40:29.720]  even know me just wanted to help and wanted to make sure that i could continue telling the truth
[03:40:29.720 --> 03:40:36.040]  that i could say what i wanted to say and at the time it was common core and it was organ and there
[03:40:36.040 --> 03:40:41.000]  was a murder that happened to an innocent man by the fbi and there were people that just did not
[03:40:41.000 --> 03:40:47.000]  want me talking about those particular things but i did and i wanted to because they were important
[03:40:47.000 --> 03:40:52.920]  and i could not believe what was happening to my country and this was you know six five years ago
[03:40:52.920 --> 03:40:58.440]  right five probably five five years ago uh six years ago and so i went on my own it wasn't easy
[03:40:59.000 --> 03:41:03.640]  and it took a lot of just moments where i just kind of had to grip and hold on
[03:41:03.640 --> 03:41:10.840]  but i realized that as soon as i did that and as soon as i made that choice things worked out
[03:41:10.840 --> 03:41:16.120]  they worked out beautifully actually and better than what i could have even imagined for myself
[03:41:16.760 --> 03:41:19.960]  and that was so important for me to realize at the time it was a huge lesson
[03:41:20.520 --> 03:41:25.240]  because there were moments in my life i didn't make that great move or i didn't do that great
[03:41:25.240 --> 03:41:30.840]  thing just like all of us right but when i did it was really interesting how many things were
[03:41:30.840 --> 03:41:36.040]  there to kind of shore that up and it can be really scary to leave your job for the right reason
[03:41:36.040 --> 03:41:41.560]  it can be really scary to take a stand it can be really scary to do the right thing in the face of
[03:41:42.360 --> 03:41:47.960]  well the world telling you that oh hey you might not have your home or you might you might lose
[03:41:47.960 --> 03:41:54.680]  this or that and we're so married to our stuff and we're so married to position and we're so married
[03:41:54.680 --> 03:42:01.080]  to the things of the world that it's really hard to make those decisions but let me just tell you
[03:42:01.080 --> 03:42:05.160]  there were a lot of people that stepped into help there were a lot of people that were just right
[03:42:05.160 --> 03:42:10.440]  there these little angels in my life that just honestly just came forward and i was always amazed
[03:42:10.440 --> 03:42:16.280]  at that doing the right thing isn't easy and if you want to tell the truth it gets even harder
[03:42:16.280 --> 03:42:21.880]  because in media it's very difficult these days to tell the truth everything is corporatoned right
[03:42:21.880 --> 03:42:28.040]  and uh but i would tell you that no matter what your job is if you're a physician if you're whatever
[03:42:28.040 --> 03:42:34.200]  you are take the leap do the right thing sometimes it'll work out so much better in your life than
[03:42:34.200 --> 03:42:40.200]  you ever thought it would doors will open windows will open my gosh light your life evolve into something
[03:42:40.200 --> 03:42:46.040]  great take the risk do it because i think on the other side of that you're going to find that it's
[03:42:46.040 --> 03:42:54.520]  not as scary as you thought it was going to be i'll be right back on the alex jones show with more

[03:47:50.600 --> 03:47:55.960]  about going without a paycheck because i did it and i'll tell you something the one thing it showed
[03:47:55.960 --> 03:48:03.640]  me was that i love what i do and i would do it without payment that means i'm really loving
[03:48:03.640 --> 03:48:10.680]  what i do right and when i did that and when i took that sacrifice it was scary i'm not saying it
[03:48:10.680 --> 03:48:15.480]  wasn't scary because it is and i don't want to minimize that because it's always going to be
[03:48:15.480 --> 03:48:23.480]  that level of oh my gosh what am i going to do but when i went on my own with my show when i when i
[03:48:23.480 --> 03:48:29.160]  decided to stay in and do it and then do it for those right reasons and not worry about that
[03:48:29.160 --> 03:48:32.520]  anymore not worry about the money anymore not worry about anything anymore and just do it for
[03:48:32.520 --> 03:48:37.720]  the right reasons it's amazing the the things that took place in my life right it's amazing what happened
[03:48:38.920 --> 03:48:44.520]  and it's really all about sacrifice because even when i took the smallest sacrifice really
[03:48:44.520 --> 03:48:50.760]  because you look at it in the big picture it was small um not for me at the moment but it was small
[03:48:50.760 --> 03:48:56.840]  looking back right you take that leap you're really engaging in sacrifice and then a lot of good
[03:48:56.840 --> 03:49:01.720]  things can actually come your way as well a lot of good teaching moments and so are you willing to
[03:49:01.720 --> 03:49:07.960]  do that what are you willing to do what can you do to shore up your liberty and everyone else's
[03:49:07.960 --> 03:49:13.800]  liberty have you done anything for your liberty have you done anything to show your kids what
[03:49:13.800 --> 03:49:20.840]  sacrifice and faith look like how do you want to be remembered the guy or the gal that worried a lot
[03:49:20.840 --> 03:49:26.360]  about your country or the guy or the gal that did something along the way how do you want to be
[03:49:26.360 --> 03:49:33.720]  remembered and i gave a talk once i gave a speech once in front of a lot of people and i talked
[03:49:33.720 --> 03:49:39.640]  about rosa parks right i talked about on the back of the bus taking that stand and i said do you
[03:49:39.640 --> 03:49:48.120]  remember who the person was that sat behind rosa parks do you remember his name and there was silence
[03:49:48.120 --> 03:49:53.000]  and i said nobody can tell me his name nobody knows who that was and everyone looked a little
[03:49:53.000 --> 03:49:59.560]  intrigued and there was no answer nobody could say who it was and i said yeah that's because
[03:49:59.560 --> 03:50:09.960]  nobody knows who sat behind her because he did nothing he did nothing are we the people that
[03:50:09.960 --> 03:50:17.800]  sit behind the person and we do nothing if all of us took a stand if the physician said no to the
[03:50:17.800 --> 03:50:23.720]  socialization of medicine and the orders they're given by their lawyers that dictate what you get
[03:50:23.720 --> 03:50:28.600]  when you go to the hospital even though it's deadly what if they said no what if they walked away
[03:50:28.600 --> 03:50:34.280]  there'd be no power there what if the media whores sorry but they are the media whores
[03:50:34.280 --> 03:50:39.160]  finally went hey i'm not reading that script i'm not showing up i'm not doing that what if
[03:50:39.160 --> 03:50:46.920]  they all did that would we save media sure right the mainstream media sure take away its power
[03:50:46.920 --> 03:50:51.720]  what if we stopped watching what if we stopped going to their movies what if we stopped and we
[03:50:51.720 --> 03:50:56.200]  started just putting money in and creating our own good entertainment like we did with the chosen
[03:50:56.200 --> 03:51:00.760]  right it keeps getting better and better i love it what if we did those things
[03:51:01.800 --> 03:51:05.720]  what are you going to do this year there's a song by the interrupters and i love this song
[03:51:05.720 --> 03:51:11.000]  take back your power right it's like a little punk band they're they're they're awesome and it's uh
[03:51:11.000 --> 03:51:17.160]  what's your plan for tomorrow are you a leader or will you follow what's your plan what's your plan
[03:51:17.160 --> 03:51:24.680]  for 2023 are you preparing are you going to do something will you lead out or will you just sit
[03:51:24.680 --> 03:51:31.400]  and worry worrying's nice but it doesn't do anything you know everything that we do in our
[03:51:31.400 --> 03:51:35.880]  lives takes a whole lot of faith right if you're going to do the right things if you're going to
[03:51:35.880 --> 03:51:41.080]  make decisions a lot of people don't know this about me but i i married my husband and i knew
[03:51:41.080 --> 03:51:50.120]  him for 12 days 12 days okay seriously met him and married him in 12 days and it was a scary decision
[03:51:50.120 --> 03:51:55.880]  and i also look back and it was probably pretty dumb if to to be honest i'm just being honest it was
[03:51:55.880 --> 03:52:01.480]  probably a really dumb decision and if my kids did that i'd ring their little necks but but i did
[03:52:01.480 --> 03:52:08.920]  that in 12 days okay and people ask how we've been married for 27 years now how's that how's
[03:52:08.920 --> 03:52:15.320]  that worked for us how did we do that and we did it because we have shared values we both had a lot
[03:52:15.320 --> 03:52:21.720]  of faith in each other we both had a commitment to each other and he was very he always put me
[03:52:21.720 --> 03:52:26.760]  on a pedestal as the mom and the wife and i also put him on a pedestal as being the husband
[03:52:26.760 --> 03:52:32.280]  there was a moment there where he wanted to move and i didn't and when he wanted to move i didn't
[03:52:32.280 --> 03:52:38.120]  think it was a good decision but you know he was he's the guy in our house he's the dad he's the
[03:52:38.120 --> 03:52:42.920]  he's the father of the kids and he wanted to do that so i backed him support him even though i
[03:52:42.920 --> 03:52:48.040]  didn't want to do it it ended up being a great move for us it ended up being really wonderful
[03:52:48.040 --> 03:52:54.120]  things came came into being because of that move but i wasn't initially supportive but i realized
[03:52:54.120 --> 03:53:02.120]  that you know i i was committed to this person and this person was the person that is is really
[03:53:02.680 --> 03:53:08.840]  the head of our family and okay and i wanted the kids to see me support that even though i didn't
[03:53:08.840 --> 03:53:15.080]  even agree wanted to see them to see me support that and uh and my husband and i were pretty
[03:53:15.080 --> 03:53:21.240]  traditional right i love being in the kitchen i like making food i i i like those things i
[03:53:21.240 --> 03:53:26.680]  like that he's a guy's guy i like all of those things and what's interesting what came out of
[03:53:26.680 --> 03:53:32.760]  that was this wonderful committed relationship where um we've got a happy marriage but it took
[03:53:32.760 --> 03:53:39.320]  work and it took faith and it took a lot of of of making you know decisions and deciding that it was
[03:53:39.320 --> 03:53:44.040]  going to work out when we get through life those are the things that are going to matter
[03:53:45.240 --> 03:53:50.680]  sticking it out doing those things and being committed and and finding out what your values
[03:53:50.680 --> 03:53:56.200]  are and sticking to those and don't let hollywood or the kardashians dictate those values when we
[03:53:56.200 --> 03:54:02.120]  take a stand for marriage take a stand for marriage because it's important because it's how the world
[03:54:02.120 --> 03:54:09.880]  runs when it runs great stand behind those actors and actresses that are willing to break off from
[03:54:09.880 --> 03:54:16.040]  the hollywood mold to support those things put your money into things that are that produce
[03:54:16.040 --> 03:54:24.200]  goodness that tell the truth that give the good messages take the leaps take the sacrifices walk
[03:54:24.200 --> 03:54:30.600]  away from a job and i know it's comfortable to stay but walk away from a job if you know
[03:54:30.600 --> 03:54:36.120]  that the objective of that job is either taking people's liberty away or it's not doing the
[03:54:36.120 --> 03:54:41.720]  right thing for others then leave it i promise you your life will end up better i promise you
[03:54:41.720 --> 03:54:48.440]  it'll pay off what do you want your obituary to say about you he led a nice comfortable life
[03:54:49.160 --> 03:54:56.600]  or this person really stood for things it's so important to me to do that and i and it's also
[03:54:56.600 --> 03:55:01.720]  important to get our lives on track we need all of you we need all of you all hands on deck right
[03:55:01.720 --> 03:55:07.160]  now we need you to be healthy we need you to get sleep we need you to improve your relationships
[03:55:07.160 --> 03:55:14.360]  we need you to sacrifice we need all hands on deck it never was going to be the entire country
[03:55:14.360 --> 03:55:19.960]  saving this country because we've we've never been that even in revolutionary times it was a small
[03:55:19.960 --> 03:55:25.320]  percentage but there is one thing i know we were never supposed to win that war so i always leave
[03:55:25.320 --> 03:55:31.480]  room for miracles because miracles do happen and i always have a belief in miracles and as we start
[03:55:31.480 --> 03:55:38.680]  this new year 2023 i realized that it's going to take a lot of us making a lot more sacrifices
[03:55:38.680 --> 03:55:43.400]  than what we have done in the past we're going to have to take more stands that are uncomfortable
[03:55:43.400 --> 03:55:48.360]  we're going to have to voice our opinion more through major censorship we're going to have
[03:55:48.360 --> 03:55:55.240]  another glovid come our way what are we going to do as a populace the one thing that makes these
[03:55:55.240 --> 03:56:02.680]  people that run things very very nervous is the unpredictable people and what we'll do now they
[03:56:02.680 --> 03:56:06.920]  might think they have us nailed as far as what we're going to do but why don't we show them
[03:56:07.800 --> 03:56:15.720]  why don't we quietly get together and realize the power we have as people make our lives right
[03:56:15.720 --> 03:56:22.360]  right put good decisions under your belt and put sacrifice under your belt because that's
[03:56:22.360 --> 03:56:27.240]  the only way we're going to get through this and all the scary things we talk about all the things
[03:56:27.240 --> 03:56:31.960]  that are coming our way yeah they're coming our way and we're going to have to get through them
[03:56:31.960 --> 03:56:35.720]  and not just get through them but endure them well we're going to have to get through them but
[03:56:35.720 --> 03:56:40.920]  also come out better on the other side of them and the only way we're going to do that is with
[03:56:40.920 --> 03:56:46.520]  each other and create communities of like-minded people they're afraid of us in numbers they really
[03:56:46.520 --> 03:56:54.360]  are and i want to get to a point where we are the kinds of people that can save this country we
[03:56:54.360 --> 03:56:58.840]  got to work on ourselves a little bit we've got to work on relationships and we've also got to
[03:56:58.840 --> 03:57:03.160]  start really networking and figuring out what we're going to do in the face of adversity coming
[03:57:03.960 --> 03:57:09.720]  how are we going to do this and i know we can do it because i know that many of you have made
[03:57:09.720 --> 03:57:15.160]  sacrifices and many of you are better for it and can really stand there and say i've done something
[03:57:15.160 --> 03:57:21.640]  for liberty be the be the person that sits behind the person that does something and do something
[03:57:21.640 --> 03:57:28.440]  too it's important and it's important for all of us to see it is what does that do it creates
[03:57:28.440 --> 03:57:34.600]  momentum and momentum of a large populace of people not the whole populace but a large populace
[03:57:34.600 --> 03:57:40.520]  and save this country we really can if we wanted to on the alex jones show i'm kate dally your
