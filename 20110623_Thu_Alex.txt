[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:38.040]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:38.040 --> 00:44.760]  welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome and thank you so much for joining us today
[00:44.760 --> 00:55.200]  for this very important worldwide transmission obviously the hoax that the
[00:55.200 --> 01:00.520]  economy has gotten better is beginning to implode and I have a stock of mainstream
[01:00.520 --> 01:04.760]  media going ahead and being honest because no one's buying their propaganda
[01:04.760 --> 01:10.280]  anymore I mean almost no one and they're capitulating and admitting that the
[01:10.280 --> 01:16.040]  economy is wrecked and basically a depression the mainstream media is also
[01:16.040 --> 01:23.000]  coming out and admitting that this is a war in Libya as if we need them to tell
[01:23.000 --> 01:27.320]  us it's a war now now they're saying Obama looks stupid they've been saying
[01:27.320 --> 01:32.280]  all week saying it's not a war and Hillary's asking Congress what side are
[01:32.280 --> 01:36.040]  you on well maybe they're starting to discover just how much trouble the
[01:36.040 --> 01:41.080]  Bill of Rights a Constitution that's the spirit of America what makes America
[01:41.080 --> 01:45.880]  special property rights all that good stuff separation of powers checks and
[01:45.880 --> 01:52.200]  balances a president not an emperor not a king George Washington was offered the
[01:52.200 --> 01:57.040]  kingship traitorously by Alexander Hamilton and others and he said no sir
[01:57.040 --> 02:02.560]  get out of my face well you might as well have a king if you don't have
[02:02.560 --> 02:08.640]  Congress involved in things and so I guess Congress might wanna in fact I
[02:08.640 --> 02:11.560]  got chills reading it this morning I didn't used to get chills I'm like a
[02:11.560 --> 02:17.480]  woman going into menopause or something all this news is so I literally get
[02:17.480 --> 02:22.080]  these tingles constantly now because the world has gotten so crazy so much is
[02:22.080 --> 02:24.880]  happening so many good things are happening so many bad things are
[02:24.880 --> 02:30.480]  happening last night separately I'm gonna get into all that news last night I
[02:30.480 --> 02:36.720]  ran in to some old friends I'll put it to you that way hadn't seen him in 15
[02:36.720 --> 02:40.600]  years one of the oldest most prominent families in Austin I'll just leave it at
[02:40.600 --> 02:48.360]  that and they told me certain things about Rick Perry that mirrors what I was
[02:48.360 --> 02:53.280]  told by a Fox News insider who was known to all of you obviously I can't give the
[02:53.280 --> 02:58.280]  source I'm sure they'll be able to talk about it I think I've already talked a
[02:58.280 --> 03:01.440]  little too much about things I've been told by that person but also by another
[03:01.440 --> 03:08.560]  source and so I need to shut up at this point with no need to send a hit team
[03:08.560 --> 03:13.920]  Perry I don't know any dirt about you it's just that well that you when you're
[03:13.920 --> 03:18.240]  sitting around with people you talk about Alex Jones and it's the same thing
[03:18.240 --> 03:24.520]  you told this Fox TV person behind closed doors I'm scared of Alex Jones why
[03:24.520 --> 03:30.600]  Perry well I I know why because they know that the Tea Party was generated by
[03:30.600 --> 03:34.800]  Ron Paul supporters and myself and others as Time Magazine got it right I'm
[03:34.800 --> 03:39.520]  the prophet of the original real Tea Party I think that's a good term to use
[03:39.520 --> 03:43.520]  and it's good term for Perry's and see the profits not known as own country the
[03:43.520 --> 03:48.720]  profit Perry's not known as own country because he was the campaign manager for
[03:48.720 --> 03:53.480]  Al Gore oh you didn't know that look it up people are looking it up and freaking
[03:53.480 --> 03:58.680]  out they thought I was just making that up I get some things wrong I did a three
[03:58.680 --> 04:02.000]  hour show every day I probably get something wrong every day or off or
[04:02.000 --> 04:10.480]  twisted around in my brain because I don't have teleprompters but the point
[04:10.480 --> 04:18.320]  is Perry knows that I know his real record and I mean when I when I premiered
[04:18.320 --> 04:27.240]  in game his chief of staff showed up well no chief of media showed up to tell
[04:27.240 --> 04:35.280]  me Perry was a fan and only went to Bilderberg to talk to them and all I'm
[04:35.280 --> 04:39.240]  telling you is Perry is a very good chance to be the next president and he
[04:39.240 --> 04:44.360]  always talking to people about Alex Jones and this is so insane I mean why
[04:44.360 --> 04:49.480]  well Perry's got a good sixth sense and he knows that I guess for a long time
[04:49.480 --> 04:56.600]  somehow our futures are intertwined in some way but I've got that coming up
[04:56.600 --> 04:59.800]  and in red states attacking me for talking about about Perry right now
[04:59.800 --> 05:03.200]  we're gonna break that down you've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs
[05:03.200 --> 05:06.880]  generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal
[05:06.880 --> 05:10.960]  silver solutions yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs
[05:10.960 --> 05:14.440]  system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere

[05:27.600 --> 05:32.080]  applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to
[05:32.080 --> 05:39.280]  key target areas this includes the eyes ears nose lungs topically to the skin

[06:01.000 --> 06:04.360]  with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[06:04.360 --> 06:08.520]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[06:08.520 --> 06:12.840]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[06:12.840 --> 06:16.800]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[06:16.800 --> 06:21.160]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[06:21.160 --> 06:25.480]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[06:25.480 --> 06:29.240]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[06:29.240 --> 06:33.360]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[06:33.360 --> 06:37.080]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar
[06:37.080 --> 06:41.160]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[06:41.160 --> 06:43.880]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[08:06.400 --> 08:23.160]  network
[08:23.160 --> 08:33.280]  I get NSA slash Google alerts and that's really what it is is the public NSA
[08:33.280 --> 08:37.000]  system they trick you into dialing into so they can track what you're thinking
[08:37.000 --> 08:40.800]  about where you're going what you're doing it's only a secondary function that
[08:40.800 --> 08:47.600]  you get knowledge from Google but I I do get Google alerts and I got home last
[08:47.600 --> 08:53.680]  night and saw that the Dallas blog that is associated it appears with a D
[08:53.680 --> 09:00.800]  magazine and it had a headline and I was gonna print it this morning when I
[09:00.800 --> 09:05.120]  got into the office it appears they've removed it now but hopefully some of our
[09:05.120 --> 09:09.480]  great internet sluice out there can find it I've got my team digging through it I
[09:09.480 --> 09:14.320]  forget the exact headline but it was something like Obama funding conspiracy
[09:14.320 --> 09:21.480]  theories to get Perry and it actually said Alex Jones is funded by Barack
[09:21.480 --> 09:26.440]  Obama with no proof and all the commenters were like this is a disgrace
[09:26.440 --> 09:30.600]  you've disgraced this publication it's a pretty big publication and I meant to
[09:30.600 --> 09:35.400]  cover it then I got in and it's gone and I understand why it's gone because it's
[09:35.400 --> 09:42.840]  pretty libelous I mean you talk about defamation I work for Obama and I am
[09:42.840 --> 09:49.080]  going after Rick Perry because I work for Obama at the Dallas blog in fact
[09:49.080 --> 09:53.200]  we'll put the Dallas blog on screen for folks just so they have a chance to see
[09:53.200 --> 09:59.280]  what it looks like it's it's got a green and white format and when I was
[09:59.280 --> 10:02.480]  looking around for this before the show Jaren said well have you seen this and
[10:02.480 --> 10:08.120]  and no I hadn't but now I have so I guess this has caused quite a stir it says
[10:08.120 --> 10:14.560]  why is drudge linking to Alex Jones info or site and it goes on to say I'm a
[10:14.560 --> 10:23.760]  charlatan and basically that I'm bad for saying that Rick Perry went to the
[10:23.760 --> 10:31.000]  Bilderberg group and that and the Dallas blog said this that I'm discredited
[10:31.000 --> 10:35.760]  because Rick Perry is trying to pass the sanctuary city bill or has said he
[10:35.760 --> 10:39.720]  supports it and then in our article we point out that he met with the Sente Fox
[10:39.720 --> 10:44.120]  five years ago and there's video of this when Fox was there giving Texas an
[10:44.120 --> 10:48.760]  award for sanctuary cities and the point is Perry was supporting it then he may
[10:48.760 --> 10:53.080]  have changed his stance just like he said you've got to take Gardasil shots
[10:53.080 --> 10:55.920]  it's the law and then later backed off of that because it wasn't a law the
[10:55.920 --> 10:59.600]  governor can't order that or just like he tried twice for the NAFTA super
[10:59.600 --> 11:04.040]  highway and now claims he's against it even though he continued to try to veto
[11:04.040 --> 11:10.280]  Texas bills that's my point is Perry is duplicitous Rick Perry is duplicitous and
[11:10.280 --> 11:18.520]  the Republican leadership believes he is the strongest candidate and actually
[11:18.520 --> 11:22.160]  they found it I thought they'd removed it because it was non-searchable and was
[11:22.160 --> 11:26.440]  not in my NSA Google alerts there it is Dallas blog if it print that form before
[11:26.440 --> 11:32.400]  it disappears again thank you Perry updates Democrats spread Texas gov
[11:32.400 --> 11:38.440]  conspiracy theories and it actually says that President Obama has launched a
[11:38.440 --> 11:43.080]  $1 billion reelection campaign for the White House so he can finance creative
[11:43.080 --> 11:48.080]  methods to attack GOP presidential contenders accordingly he's spreading
[11:48.080 --> 11:52.760]  rumors that Texas Governor Rick Perry is a so-called puppet of a leftist
[11:52.760 --> 11:56.880]  globalist community that is intent on one world government with the United
[11:56.880 --> 12:02.360]  Nations taking the reins of power Obama is hoping these rumors can keep Tea Party
[12:02.360 --> 12:07.880]  members from supporting Perry if he receives the Republican nomination
[12:07.880 --> 12:13.120]  here's an example of the Obama instigated conspiracy theory so they've
[12:13.120 --> 12:16.720]  just said Obama's funding this and now they say here's an example about
[12:16.720 --> 12:21.080]  Governor Perry on the info wars.com website every indication suggests that
[12:21.080 --> 12:25.080]  Bilderberg approved Texas Governor Rick Perry is set to become the frontrunner
[12:25.080 --> 12:28.320]  and the Republican race to challenge Barack Obama of the presidency
[12:28.320 --> 12:33.880]  illustrating once again how a shady secretive and undemocratic global
[12:33.880 --> 12:39.560]  elite holds the reins of power of true power while Americans are distracted by
[12:39.560 --> 12:46.000]  the delusional notion that they have a genuine choice in 2012 and they go on to
[12:46.000 --> 12:50.320]  say Paul Joseph Watson is financed by Barack Obama and if you go down to the
[12:50.320 --> 12:54.720]  commenters below that if they're still there from when I read it last night they
[12:54.720 --> 12:59.640]  are saying what is your problem there's no link to proof Obama funds us you're
[12:59.640 --> 13:04.800]  the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones investigated Bilderberg in 2008 when
[13:04.800 --> 13:08.760]  Obama and Hillary were secretly there in Virginia in fact we'll put it back on
[13:08.760 --> 13:13.360]  screen I'm gonna read some of those for folks again just to illustrate the dirty
[13:13.360 --> 13:17.800]  tricks that are going on because it turns out this blog is basically half
[13:17.800 --> 13:21.320]  pro-rick Perry so it I mean like half the articles on their front page I just
[13:21.320 --> 13:26.160]  looked at it well it is pro-rick Perry so if anybody's getting financed here by
[13:26.160 --> 13:29.000]  political party we need to look at this group of course I don't have any proof
[13:29.000 --> 13:32.680]  of that it just looks like that but see I said it looks like that not that they
[13:32.680 --> 13:37.840]  do work for Perry and it goes on and says politics is a full-contact sports
[13:37.840 --> 13:42.400]  stop playing victim and get to the polls nothing new here just same dirty
[13:42.400 --> 13:45.760]  politics as usual so these idiots are buying that I've done this since the
[13:45.760 --> 13:50.420]  Tea Party doesn't exist how can it have members and it goes on to say this
[13:50.420 --> 13:54.720]  writer is a gullible adult Paul Joseph Watson is the farthest thing from being
[13:54.720 --> 14:00.680]  a conspiracy theorist and working for Obama you're obviously not a real
[14:00.680 --> 14:05.680]  journalist and you just write opinion pieces and defamation piece because they
[14:05.680 --> 14:10.800]  aren't doing with Rick Perry is the same thing that was done with Obama before
[14:10.800 --> 14:15.520]  he was elected if you did your own research you would have read places by
[14:15.520 --> 14:18.720]  Mr. Watson pieces by Mr. Watson I'm reading from across the room off a TV
[14:18.720 --> 14:23.400]  screen Watson let me back up I'm trying to hurry up here too much
[14:23.400 --> 14:31.560]  I'll thank you they've blown it up for me now I can read it all you do is write
[14:31.560 --> 14:35.880]  opinion pieces because what they are doing with Rick Perry is the same thing
[14:35.880 --> 14:40.440]  that was done with Obama before he was elected if you did your own research
[14:40.440 --> 14:45.960]  you would have read pieces by Mr. Watson about Obama as well get your
[14:45.960 --> 14:49.640]  elementary mind out of the false left-right mindset and open it up to
[14:49.640 --> 14:54.200]  what's really going on here's another commenter I'm not seeing the connection
[14:54.200 --> 14:57.840]  between Obama and Watson again prison planet writer the article they linked
[14:57.840 --> 15:04.640]  to that was on Drudge it is not a easier connection to supposition that one or
[15:04.640 --> 15:09.160]  the other Republicans would want to knock Perry out of the top spot continue
[15:09.160 --> 15:14.000]  to the next commenter basically the commenters are not buying it it goes
[15:14.000 --> 15:17.560]  on this is the dumbest article I've ever read where did Obama himself talk
[15:17.560 --> 15:21.040]  about so-called Bilderberg's this sounds like conspiracy theorist rubbish
[15:21.040 --> 15:25.440]  being thrown around once again this is unsubstantiated bleep and totally
[15:25.440 --> 15:33.840]  irrelevant okay so there is that article that says we are financed by Obama
[15:33.840 --> 15:38.480]  now see it's already started again when I didn't like Bill Clinton selling out
[15:38.480 --> 15:44.160]  our missile secrets and agenda 21 and trying to push carbon taxes and running
[15:44.160 --> 15:49.000]  scams with Kinley and Enron and all the mysterious deaths and it went on and on
[15:49.000 --> 15:54.600]  and on the whole Clinton East agenda and Mina Arkansas I was called by national
[15:54.600 --> 16:00.480]  media a super hardcore right wing extremist then Bush gets into office and
[16:00.480 --> 16:04.320]  I go hey Bush is launching new wars Patriot Act police state federal power
[16:04.320 --> 16:10.640]  grabs I don't like what he's doing I was called a communist and they claim you
[16:10.640 --> 16:15.120]  know we work with Van Jones and all this type garbage just totally made up just
[16:15.120 --> 16:19.040]  like now we work with Obama they're saying and and then Obama comes into
[16:19.040 --> 16:24.640]  office and the left comes out and says I'm a hardcore right winger turn this
[16:24.640 --> 16:29.640]  phone off so busy before I get on air I'm just like a madhouse up here there we
[16:29.640 --> 16:35.160]  go but continuing here so when a Republican puppets in power I'm a
[16:35.160 --> 16:40.440]  communist according to the media both sides when a Democrat is in office I'm
[16:40.440 --> 16:47.160]  a super ultra hardcore you know total right-winger and these are all labels
[16:47.160 --> 16:52.360]  just to keep you in this limited debate spectrum and I got all this world news
[16:52.360 --> 16:56.320]  economic news big guests coming up on to tell you about but but but but out of
[16:56.320 --> 16:59.800]  the gates I'm talking about this because not because it's about Alex Jones but
[16:59.800 --> 17:05.200]  because it's a great way to illustrate what's going on in the controlled left
[17:05.200 --> 17:09.600]  right a mainline Republican mainline Democratic system in this country
[17:09.600 --> 17:13.720]  because now that Perry's getting ready to position himself to be the front runner
[17:13.720 --> 17:17.200]  and you watch he's gonna announce in the next few weeks soon as the session's
[17:17.200 --> 17:23.160]  over he will immediately blast past Mitt Romney and he will but I mean this is
[17:23.160 --> 17:28.360]  what the Republican strategists believe I have shot there okay at the bar stool
[17:28.360 --> 17:32.400]  with and people say well tell us who well that's because people aren't
[17:32.400 --> 17:35.920]  journalists and I don't even claim to be the ultimate journalist I wear many
[17:35.920 --> 17:41.120]  hats but the reason I get so much information is because I don't give up
[17:41.120 --> 17:46.240]  my sources just like the sources last night who I were listening probably
[17:46.240 --> 17:49.440]  right now because they seem nervous after they told me this stuff don't worry
[17:49.440 --> 17:53.360]  I'm not gonna say you are the problem is I shouldn't even give any hints because
[17:53.360 --> 17:57.520]  then other people in the establishment hear this and know who they told and
[17:57.520 --> 18:02.600]  then they go figure it out and there's problems like when I said a pastor in
[18:02.600 --> 18:07.800]  Ohio sent us Homeland Security documents five years ago six years ago now of the
[18:07.800 --> 18:12.880]  clergy response teams I shouldn't have even said the state they were from they
[18:12.880 --> 18:18.200]  figured it out and went after them Fox News figured out well who one of my
[18:18.200 --> 18:21.520]  sources was and got on them and now the person doesn't have me on the show they
[18:21.520 --> 18:26.720]  won't come on this show and I can't get them on the phone side issue so the
[18:26.720 --> 18:30.960]  truth is I'm not good at keeping sources because because because I want to tell
[18:30.960 --> 18:36.400]  you but then I can't even give any hints so point is I have it from the
[18:36.400 --> 18:40.120]  security detail and there's that's a big detail they won't find out who from two
[18:40.120 --> 18:43.120]  different sources and then another source separately that knows the security
[18:43.120 --> 18:47.360]  detail directly from the security detail on two two points a separate
[18:47.360 --> 18:51.000]  connection through a news person here in town that knows the security detail that
[18:51.000 --> 18:57.360]  I met with a few days ago through Republican strategist from I'm gonna
[18:57.360 --> 19:02.200]  shut up right there okay he it's been the plan all along does it mean a hundred
[19:02.200 --> 19:07.000]  percent he's gonna win no but the system believes he's the winner and the money is
[19:07.000 --> 19:11.240]  gonna put you saw Limbaugh come out and start this drafting campaign a month ago
[19:11.240 --> 19:15.840]  I told you years ago it's Rick Perry I told you three and a half years ago an
[19:15.840 --> 19:19.560]  in-game I told you this last year when he comes out and says I've got a pledge
[19:19.560 --> 19:23.320]  I'm not gonna run in 2012 the point is he's not rethinking to break the pledge
[19:23.320 --> 19:27.920]  which is bad enough the point is he was always going to break the pledge it was
[19:27.920 --> 19:35.520]  part of a manipulation he's a master politician but now red state big main
[19:35.520 --> 19:39.440]  line Republican side is attacking drudge for running our Bilderberg article
[19:39.440 --> 19:42.840]  about Perry and I told you when I saw that on Monday it was gonna cause a
[19:42.840 --> 19:46.520]  frackish that drudge was to do you know it's one thing to talk about
[19:46.520 --> 19:49.800]  Democrats and their connection to globalist drudge is being a real
[19:49.800 --> 19:53.240]  journalist and letting you know about Perry and the Republicans are going

[24:05.480 --> 24:09.480]  all right I don't want to spend all day on this because I want to come back and
[24:09.480 --> 24:15.040]  get into the unbelievable developments in the Middle East and oil prices in the
[24:15.040 --> 24:20.840]  economy I want to get into this latest video that came out yesterday I wasn't
[24:20.840 --> 24:26.080]  going to cover it because there's so many instances of it but since I heard
[24:26.080 --> 24:31.120]  national so-called conservative host defending it and since it's a big
[24:31.120 --> 24:34.640]  national debate this particular video the woman in Rochester being arrested
[24:34.640 --> 24:41.520]  for videotaping police from her own yard I thought I would just go to YouTube and
[24:41.520 --> 24:46.280]  type in camera person arrested in and there's literally thousands of videos
[24:46.280 --> 24:53.320]  thousands of results of reporters being arrested for videotaping an overturned
[24:53.320 --> 24:59.280]  18-wheeler from you know a hundred yards away their job of citizens being
[24:59.280 --> 25:05.520]  attacked of just crazy behavior and look I'm not even trying to demonize the
[25:05.520 --> 25:10.440]  police that plays into what the system wants to divide the police from the
[25:10.440 --> 25:17.280]  people and vice versa I mean it's actually painful to watch all of this
[25:17.280 --> 25:21.360]  and to know what's happened to my reporters my Rob do was arrested for
[25:21.360 --> 25:26.160]  videotaping police from a hilltop at the G20 peacefully this one I hadn't
[25:26.160 --> 25:30.720]  arrested him I've had security guards with guns in Kansas City come up to
[25:30.720 --> 25:34.000]  Aaron and the point is I could play hundreds of these next hour I'm gonna
[25:34.000 --> 25:37.720]  do a special report on this and go over some of it but getting back to the
[25:37.720 --> 25:47.080]  Republican establishment I have hit a real soft spot with the system going
[25:47.080 --> 25:52.920]  after Rick Perry and I'm not going after Rick Perry okay I have to tell the truth
[25:52.920 --> 25:59.520]  though about him I mean at the end of the day yes I'll be honest he does have a
[25:59.520 --> 26:06.720]  pro-gun record and he is anti-abortion and so I at a certain level like he more
[26:06.720 --> 26:14.920]  than Obama but he was Al Gore's campaign chairman in Texas that's on record don't
[26:14.920 --> 26:17.960]  believe me just search it it's Wall Street Journal New York Times Texas
[26:17.960 --> 26:23.600]  Monthly I'm not lying just trust but verify go look it up he flip flops
[26:23.600 --> 26:28.240]  constantly he tried to make it will take a shot that killed little girls that's
[26:28.240 --> 26:33.640]  CBS News I don't just say these things go look it up we had a special report on
[26:33.640 --> 26:40.360]  it that shows all the articles he went to Bilderberg he's a globalist and the
[26:40.360 --> 26:45.640]  and the weird thing is I kept wondering why that one day he came on the radio he
[26:45.640 --> 26:50.040]  found out that I was on the air from a remote with a reporter at the Capitol he
[26:50.040 --> 26:55.120]  came over and to a reporter I know and grabbed the phone away and and came on
[26:55.120 --> 27:02.440]  my show and then I find out from all these media sources national local and
[27:02.440 --> 27:11.480]  and then very well-to-do Austin icon type folks that when Perry comes around he
[27:11.480 --> 27:18.160]  talks about how I'm basically he thinks I'm a nice guy talented but dangerous
[27:18.160 --> 27:23.000]  and dangerous for him politically I mean here's the thing I hadn't told these
[27:23.000 --> 27:29.520]  people it doesn't matter I'm not even gonna get into it it's creepy ladies and
[27:29.520 --> 27:34.880]  gentlemen I'm a talk show host from Austin Texas and I've got the governor
[27:34.880 --> 27:40.120]  of Texas who I would love to believe in and love to support over Obama who I
[27:40.120 --> 27:43.840]  know is duplicitous with Carl Rove and Al Gore in his background I mean I'm
[27:43.840 --> 27:47.960]  sorry I just don't trust him and it's the same thing with Democrats I wanted to
[27:47.960 --> 27:51.720]  believe in Obama saying he didn't the war and saying he was gonna end torture
[27:51.720 --> 27:55.560]  and not hire lobbyists but I said folks I know who his advisors are and who's
[27:55.560 --> 28:03.000]  financing him he's going to lie about all that and he asked so I want things to
[28:03.000 --> 28:07.760]  get better I want to believe in Obama or Rick Perry or George Bush or but I'm
[28:07.760 --> 28:13.280]  sorry I cannot be a chump and and to hear the nice things well if you ever
[28:13.280 --> 28:17.640]  see Alex these are people I haven't seen in 15 years I'd run into him if you
[28:17.640 --> 28:26.760]  ever see Alex you know it was just and then him sending his head press person
[28:26.760 --> 28:30.960]  to end game to sit in the front row and come up say the governor likes you the
[28:30.960 --> 28:37.600]  governor's really a good guy the governor you know wants to be friends and I
[28:37.600 --> 28:43.520]  was not that prominent in 2007 I mean I was big but Perry is real it creeps me
[28:43.520 --> 28:48.000]  out that Perry smart enough to keep his eye on me and to tell a Fox News high
[28:48.000 --> 28:52.320]  level person I'll leave it at that to tell a prominent family in Austin to
[28:52.320 --> 28:56.840]  tell other media people I mean Rick Perry and now he's got his attack dogs
[28:56.840 --> 29:03.320]  undoubtedly coming after me this and attacking drudge because they know
[29:03.320 --> 29:08.640]  that's one of the big conduits that that our information is getting out on but
[29:08.640 --> 29:12.560]  drudge doesn't like that what the TSA is doing drudge knows the Bilderberg groups
[29:12.560 --> 29:18.280]  real drudge is popular because he will go places that the dinosaur dying media
[29:18.280 --> 29:23.880]  won't but but but here's red state today the big Republican site why is drudge
[29:23.880 --> 29:27.800]  linking to Alex Jones info or site we're come back over this it's basically a
[29:27.800 --> 29:34.960]  repeat of what the Dallas blog is saying I mean they don't go as far as to say
[29:34.960 --> 29:40.840]  unequivocally I work for a Barack Obama yeah the Obama deception I work for

[33:20.880 --> 33:24.640]  reporter would call into the show and that's when Perry was walking by and
[33:24.640 --> 33:28.160]  hey Alex Jones on the phone and Perry grabs the phone and goes hey fat hog what
[33:28.160 --> 33:33.480]  are you doing Jonesy and it was Rick Perry and Rick Perry relayed that story
[33:33.480 --> 33:40.280]  to these people as well but but but but but we can't find that you know we didn't

[33:48.320 --> 33:52.880]  thought Rick Perry on Alex Jones show can't find it that way Rick Perry Jim
[33:52.880 --> 33:58.800]  Dillon Alex Jones you know talk to Rick Perry Rick Perry calls Alex Jones a
[33:58.800 --> 34:03.320]  fat sweaty hog because I was sweating right over the fence and like a hundred
[34:03.320 --> 34:07.560]  degree temperature when Vicente Fox was giving Texas the award for sanctuary
[34:07.560 --> 34:12.440]  cities that was in the news he gave Texas Wells Fargo the Austin Police

[34:17.680 --> 34:23.680]  bullhorn demon Fox wasn't used to the videos on the web you can just search
[34:23.680 --> 34:26.920]  Alex Jones could France Vicente Fox something like that'll pull it up it's
[34:26.920 --> 34:32.360]  actually in the mini documentary that's an extra on in-game called Battle for
[34:32.360 --> 34:35.840]  the Republic but that footage is actually in there Fox drives by Arils's
[34:35.840 --> 34:38.520]  window down real hatefully I go right around to the back of the governor's
[34:38.520 --> 34:42.600]  mansion the state police did their job to defend the First Amendment as they
[34:42.600 --> 34:46.280]  did when we stormed the Capitol peacefully with the info war a month ago
[34:46.280 --> 34:52.800]  they didn't arrest me and it looked like some of the governor's main detail came
[34:52.800 --> 34:55.680]  over and tried to give the state police orders even though it's the state police
[34:55.680 --> 35:01.800]  that protect him another unit they wouldn't do it wouldn't protect them
[35:01.800 --> 35:05.600]  from the bullhornings they had to stop the press conference and they have the
[35:05.600 --> 35:09.480]  state guard out there in full colors and dress but but I'm digressing and
[35:09.480 --> 35:14.000]  there's all this other news I want to put it out to the info war crowd if we
[35:14.000 --> 35:18.960]  can get it on the prison planet forum or if you can email it to Aaron at info
[35:18.960 --> 35:26.960]  wars.com two a's or show tips at info wars.com can somebody find the audio
[35:26.960 --> 35:30.720]  of Rick Perry on my show I think that would be some really interesting
[35:30.720 --> 35:35.360]  information but getting back to the gatekeeping or the attempted gatekeeping
[35:35.360 --> 35:41.920]  that's going on with the mighty drudge report drudge report calm red state
[35:41.920 --> 35:45.720]  also substantive in its own right says why is drudge linking the Alex Jones
[35:45.720 --> 35:50.080]  info war site now remember the other neocon publication Dallas blog that
[35:50.080 --> 35:56.600]  masquerades is a news operation says that I am funded by Obama no proof no
[35:56.600 --> 36:01.200]  nothing total cook them just showed you that earlier might as well be funded by
[36:01.200 --> 36:06.560]  Santa Claus for that manner and it continues as I normally do on a daily
[36:06.560 --> 36:09.560]  basis I visit the drudge report on the left hand column there are three links
[36:09.560 --> 36:14.600]  regarding Texas Governor Rick Perry this is back from a few days ago on Monday
[36:14.600 --> 36:19.120]  we just found it today and it goes the first link is the national journal
[36:19.120 --> 36:27.800]  Perry Road test stump speech the second link is MSNBC or NBC Perry stand up and
[36:27.800 --> 36:30.240]  stop apologizing third link info wars.com
[36:30.240 --> 36:36.680]  Bilderberg approved Perry set to become GOP frontrunner and he linked to our
[36:36.680 --> 36:42.640]  well-researched article and and what the Dallas blog does is what D magazine did
[36:42.640 --> 36:49.120]  and basically they say this is curious Jones claims in this article by Paul
[36:49.120 --> 36:54.920]  Watson that Perry met with the Sente Fox to promote sanctuary cities well that
[36:54.920 --> 36:59.360]  was the the main reason for the visit and then and Perry was going along with
[36:59.360 --> 37:03.600]  it then things have changed and Perry's gone for being a mainline Rhino
[37:03.600 --> 37:08.680]  publicly to claiming he's this less secede from the union you know shooting
[37:08.680 --> 37:12.480]  his guns up in the air like Yosemite Sam and claiming he's killing coyotes and
[37:12.480 --> 37:18.640]  posing with guns constantly and I've got to say I like that but but is it real
[37:18.640 --> 37:23.720]  well fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me fool me a hundred
[37:23.720 --> 37:28.080]  times you know I've got a lobotomy here well I don't have a lobotomy and so
[37:28.080 --> 37:31.880]  that's why I've been talking about Rick Perry because it disgusts me to have him
[37:31.880 --> 37:34.760]  you know months ago I pledged to not run for president 2012
[37:34.760 --> 37:40.080]  Perry rethinking pledge oh he's the reluctant guy and oh they're drafting
[37:40.080 --> 37:45.320]  him when I have from directly inside his operation for years and currently that
[37:45.320 --> 37:51.080]  it's all a ruse he's not rethinking the pledge he was never going to follow the
[37:51.080 --> 37:57.120]  pledge it was a fraud and now we have headlines his wife's telling him to run
[37:57.120 --> 38:02.040]  I mean they're just building up the anticipation you know they're oh my gosh I
[38:02.040 --> 38:06.000]  mean you can see it all there just on the surface and the media sees it
[38:06.000 --> 38:10.560]  testing his stump speeches putting out the fed up book but then there's the
[38:10.560 --> 38:18.800]  creepiness of learning from a Fox News individual from other folks consultants
[38:18.800 --> 38:23.600]  and then people that know Perry and her friends with him that when he sits down
[38:23.600 --> 38:32.120]  to you know with him it's wants to talk about Alex Jones I mean it's just
[38:32.120 --> 38:38.080]  bizarre I mean I'm not that important but I guess Perry must listen and watch
[38:38.080 --> 38:42.280]  the show I mean well he's been on the show that you know to call me a fat hog
[38:42.280 --> 38:47.600]  and he knew it was live radio so he now he told other people how much he likes
[38:47.600 --> 38:52.720]  me but he of course knows that they like the show so he's gonna say that it's all
[38:52.720 --> 39:00.080]  part of the chameleon political shift shape shifter that is Rick Perry but it
[39:00.080 --> 39:03.640]  goes on this is apparently not the first time drudge has linked to the
[39:03.640 --> 39:09.600]  charlatan no proof they just use the word charlatan Alex Jones but this piece
[39:09.600 --> 39:13.760]  is absolutely ridiculous drudge loses credibility by linking to such garbage
[39:13.760 --> 39:19.800]  they said another word on his site first there was the tale the title Rick Perry
[39:19.800 --> 39:25.280]  if he gets in will be formidable but does anyone think really think he becomes
[39:25.280 --> 39:30.360]  the automatic front-runner funny after my article Monday said that there were a
[39:30.360 --> 39:35.800]  CNBC article a bunch of others in polls already showing Perry a front-runner not
[39:35.800 --> 39:39.360]  even announced in fact search that I think that's the exact headline Perry
[39:39.360 --> 39:43.800]  becoming a front-runner Perry already a front-runner that should oh I'm
[39:43.800 --> 39:48.600]  insane I'm discredited drudge is discredited I'm saying Perry's a front
[39:48.600 --> 39:52.040]  runner without announcing and then all these other newspapers agree with me and
[39:52.040 --> 39:57.440]  political analysts I mean come on you think Russ Limbaugh the big insider is
[39:57.440 --> 40:02.880]  endorsing him if the word is it's just like Obama everybody knew that that he
[40:02.880 --> 40:07.400]  was being vetted five six years ago it was in the news that hey watch this guy
[40:07.400 --> 40:13.960]  he's he's got the inside track oh yeah drudge is real discredited oh and
[40:13.960 --> 40:17.040]  drudge is gonna be real discredited when Perry announces just like we said he
[40:17.040 --> 40:19.920]  would and when he becomes the front-runner and when he gets the
[40:19.920 --> 40:26.440]  nomination oh yeah there's a reason people visit info wars calm there's a
[40:26.440 --> 40:30.480]  reason this radio show reaches tens of millions of people a week now there's a
[40:30.480 --> 40:35.440]  reason we're number one on the web and and now soon at this rate will be at 150
[40:35.440 --> 40:41.080]  stations we're now over 120 that that's big for a hardcore show like this and
[40:41.080 --> 40:48.320]  all a lot of them are big stations 50,000 waters 10,000 waters the hot you
[40:48.320 --> 40:53.880]  know hundred thousand watt fm's we're we're coming on strong here and the
[40:53.880 --> 40:58.360]  system knows it and I'm risking my name everything I think they're gonna just
[40:58.360 --> 41:01.720]  continue to try to assassinate my credibility but when they figure out
[41:01.720 --> 41:05.440]  that's not gonna work what do they do next I mean every day I come on air and
[41:05.440 --> 41:09.640]  get more hardcore not less every day I refuse to sell out when the offers are
[41:09.640 --> 41:19.120]  constantly coming in in slick ways is days I get closer to the graveyard and I
[41:19.120 --> 41:24.880]  pray for a hedge of protection but I can feel the creepiness and so do I
[41:24.880 --> 41:30.880]  subconsciously I had an urge today after last night to come in here and say nice
[41:30.880 --> 41:35.800]  things about Rick Perry and to be a wimp but I'm not gonna do it and I don't
[41:35.800 --> 41:38.760]  think the drudge reports gonna do it I mean he's had positive negative he just
[41:38.760 --> 41:41.680]  he's got interesting news about Perry up on a site because he's got good
[41:41.680 --> 41:45.080]  political instincts that's why he's number one not just America's news
[41:45.080 --> 41:49.080]  editor but the world's news editor and that's not kissing up it's no brag it's
[41:49.080 --> 41:54.400]  just fact and drudge deserves credit I mean he's the guy that really drove TSA
[41:54.400 --> 42:00.520]  into the big issue it is now he's the guy that drives so much because and the
[42:00.520 --> 42:05.280]  word is drudge doesn't really talk to many people anymore he gets more and more
[42:05.280 --> 42:09.680]  private and that's because drudge is getting deeper down the rabbit hole of
[42:09.680 --> 42:13.160]  reality but I don't want to speak for drudge I mean what do I know and I like
[42:13.160 --> 42:21.160]  I know drudge I just I just think he's got a great website but continuing here
[42:21.160 --> 42:28.400]  sorry hold on okay continuing here why is drudge linking to Alex Jones in
[42:28.400 --> 42:33.040]  fall worse side and then it goes on this is apparently not the first time no
[42:33.040 --> 42:36.800]  hundreds of times the drudge is linked to the Charlotte and Alex Jones but this
[42:36.800 --> 42:42.120]  piece is absolutely ridiculous drudge loses credibility by linking to such
[42:42.120 --> 42:47.400]  bleeper on his site first there's the title and then it goes on to say I'm
[42:47.400 --> 42:51.720]  crazy because we're saying he's gonna be the front runner and by the way did we
[42:51.720 --> 42:56.160]  find the headlines about Perry already a front runner I saw that I saw that on
[42:56.160 --> 43:02.200]  like Tuesday or Wednesday we'll dig that up and then it just continues to say
[43:02.200 --> 43:05.400]  we're nuts talking about the Bilderberg group and we're nuts saying he was a
[43:05.400 --> 43:10.720]  protege of Carl Rove and his bush 2.0 and isn't a real tea partier but I mean
[43:10.720 --> 43:14.760]  all of this is credible what we said
[43:19.440 --> 43:23.280]  but most the commenters are not buying it so that's the good news and I'm done
[43:23.280 --> 43:27.400]  talking about that but can somebody help us with our combined brain power and
[43:27.400 --> 43:33.720]  searching power to find that I mean I oh there it is Rick Perry is hot button
[43:33.720 --> 43:37.840]  topic at Republican conference Rick Perry would be front runner for
[43:37.840 --> 43:44.680]  presidential nomination London Guardian oh the biggest paper in England and in
[43:44.680 --> 43:49.480]  Europe because English is this language they use in Europe to communicate with
[43:49.480 --> 43:53.600]  each other you know the Danes and the Germans and the French and everybody
[43:53.600 --> 44:01.120]  else you can find a whole bunch more too oh I'm crazy my writer Paul Watson
[44:01.120 --> 44:04.880]  writing that on Monday and drudge linking to it we're not saying he's the
[44:04.880 --> 44:08.840]  front runner well the polls are out and they show he's number two or number one
[44:08.840 --> 44:13.360]  depending if you got Mitt Romney and some polls number one Ron Paul number one
[44:13.360 --> 44:17.600]  and some and others Rick Perry so those three are kind of the top candidates
[44:17.600 --> 44:22.840]  obviously I'm a Ron Paul guy but I'm not gonna attack Perry just because I want
[44:22.840 --> 44:26.920]  Ron Paul to win I don't just politically exaggerator make stuff up because I
[44:26.920 --> 44:31.760]  want my guy to win I look at the facts and I come to my own judgment we all
[44:31.760 --> 44:39.880]  look through rose colored glasses doesn't mean I'm perfect and the hardest
[44:39.880 --> 44:45.880]  thing about not selling out is not even the fear of what they'll do to me if I
[44:45.880 --> 44:51.480]  don't sell out as I get bigger and bigger by the minute it is that they they
[44:51.480 --> 45:00.040]  are like vampires smiling at me to join them I mean I've been up to some high
[45:00.040 --> 45:06.320]  mountains ladies and gentlemen I have been offered some things many times and I
[45:06.320 --> 45:11.080]  just could never imagine I'd be in this position and it's the opposite of a
[45:11.080 --> 45:17.280]  power trip it is creepy and admit I have dreams where I'm imagining that I'm a
[45:17.280 --> 45:24.160]  auto mechanic or a work at a golf course or owner arborist business I have
[45:24.160 --> 45:26.840]  these constant recurring not really recurring is they're all different but
[45:26.840 --> 45:33.000]  they're similar where I'm oh I work at a boat dock or I'm a forestry guy or I'm
[45:33.000 --> 45:42.080]  a cop and I have dreams where I have dreams where I'm dreaming that I'm
[45:42.080 --> 45:46.440]  this big international conspiracy theorist as they call me and in the
[45:46.440 --> 45:56.720]  dream I wake up and I'm not and I and I wake up I'm happy in the dream I have
[45:56.720 --> 46:02.520]  dreams the New World Order isn't real I have I want to believe Arabs from caves
[46:02.520 --> 46:09.360]  did 9-11 I want to like Rick Perry I you know I but that's not reality okay I
[46:09.360 --> 46:14.840]  mean I have dreams the only place I have delusions in my life now is dreaming my
[46:14.840 --> 46:22.960]  brain lust after selling out my flesh wants to to waddle into the the the the
[46:22.960 --> 46:31.000]  the globalist swaray but I'm not gonna do it my destiny is set for better or
[46:31.000 --> 46:35.360]  worse forget the maneuvers go straight Adam
[46:35.360 --> 46:43.880]  man oh man I don't know what to say at this point oh let's look at the drugs
[46:43.880 --> 46:47.720]  report today let's let's go to drugs let's see what other discrediting things
[46:47.720 --> 46:52.680]  drudges supposedly doing according to red state over on the right-hand side at
[46:52.680 --> 46:58.640]  the top he's linked to infowars again oh and let's let's blow up that area of the
[46:58.640 --> 47:03.960]  drudge report drudge report calm today let's blow that up and it says TSA
[47:03.960 --> 47:09.080]  changes pat down procedures for young kids and you click on that it goes to a
[47:09.080 --> 47:15.800]  mainstream news article it goes to NBC TSA changes pat down procedures for young
[47:15.800 --> 47:23.000]  kids now now that came out today now let's back out of that article and let's
[47:23.000 --> 47:32.900]  go under it and it says flashback TSA lies about policy change on child pat
[47:32.900 --> 47:45.440]  downs and it's from today and the article then links to our flashback
[47:45.440 --> 47:49.880]  that's that first link right there changing its policy where they said
[47:49.880 --> 48:01.840]  this last year and then they said it again what in was it April and the point
[48:01.840 --> 48:07.680]  is is that they lied last year and again this year and said that they weren't
[48:07.680 --> 48:12.040]  going to do this anymore you remember hearing it don't worry under 12 no more
[48:12.040 --> 48:15.920]  pat downs don't worry at federal and state courthouses under 18 no more
[48:15.920 --> 48:19.840]  pat downs but they're not stopping that's a military psychological warfare
[48:19.840 --> 48:27.360]  tactic use my military is the world over for thousands of years to say this is
[48:27.360 --> 48:33.200]  not an assault and to tell you that they're not ramming the branch Davidian
[48:33.200 --> 48:36.880]  church with tanks and shooting people while they are come out with your hands
[48:36.880 --> 48:41.120]  up and you'll be treated fairly you come out dealt the force pops a cap in you
[48:41.120 --> 48:50.840]  on flare footage from the FBI plane above so it's admitted that TSA last
[48:50.840 --> 48:55.080]  year you go read the dates in the article and earlier this year has said
[48:55.080 --> 48:58.680]  that they are no longer patting children down funny I flew to New York flew back
[48:58.680 --> 49:03.120]  and all I saw was children in fact we robbed it was when the heaving shot
[49:03.120 --> 49:07.320]  footage of a look like about a 12-year-old being patted down and then we
[49:07.320 --> 49:10.520]  were late for our plane barely got on it because we were trying to stop when
[49:10.520 --> 49:15.000]  they were frisking it would look like a three-year-old girl but we had to go I
[49:15.000 --> 49:18.360]  think do got some of that but it's all shaky because he's trying to you know
[49:18.360 --> 49:23.480]  not have a TSA jump on us while we're filming but but the point is they told
[49:23.480 --> 49:29.600]  us last year they said we're not touching the genitals through the pants we're
[49:29.600 --> 49:32.680]  not sticking our hands in the pants and all these videos got released of them
[49:32.680 --> 49:38.320]  doing and they said well yes we do go in the pants so see there's this policy of
[49:38.320 --> 49:42.240]  lying and so is the drudge report discredited or is the TSA discredited
[49:42.240 --> 49:49.360]  are we discredited in full wars calm or as drudge report calm discredited or is
[49:49.360 --> 49:54.120]  the TSA discredited because they're the ones on record and you can pull up the
[49:54.120 --> 49:58.360]  articles of the dates last year and this year saying we are going to stop
[49:58.360 --> 50:05.520]  padding children down and they keep doing this trick don't worry just keep
[50:05.520 --> 50:09.760]  flying we're not going to pat you down and anybody who's gone to an airport if
[50:09.760 --> 50:13.360]  you sit there in the check checkpoint lane or you go through it to turn around
[50:13.360 --> 50:18.160]  watch you will see children being patted down in fact it's their favorite group
[50:18.160 --> 50:23.440]  I've seen it in Austin I've seen it in Newark I've seen it in San Jose that's
[50:23.440 --> 50:27.680]  all I seem to see but see for red state and others they can just say we're
[50:27.680 --> 50:31.560]  making that up you know what the TSA hadn't done anything wrong and you know
[50:31.560 --> 50:35.320]  what okay I won't be a conspiracy theorist in question and and have a
[50:35.320 --> 50:40.480]  memory okay the TSA never said that they would quit patting children down last
[50:40.480 --> 50:45.360]  year and earlier this year now now see I'm now a mainstream media person I
[50:45.360 --> 50:52.120]  forget all their previous lies no no see we're telling the truth and that's why
[50:52.120 --> 50:57.840]  drudge reports growing we're growing and you are shrinking because mainstream or
[50:57.840 --> 51:02.960]  media is no longer mainstream we all know that Berkey water purification
[51:02.960 --> 51:07.120]  systems are the most trusted name in water filtration as an authorized Berkey
[51:07.120 --> 51:10.960]  dealer for over six years in serving thousands of satisfied customers the

[53:02.200 --> 53:06.520]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation
[53:06.520 --> 53:09.880]  could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new
[53:09.880 --> 53:13.800]  energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[53:13.800 --> 53:18.000]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[53:18.000 --> 53:22.440]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[53:22.440 --> 53:27.200]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[53:27.200 --> 53:31.000]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[53:31.000 --> 53:34.600]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[53:34.600 --> 53:38.960]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[53:38.960 --> 53:42.120]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[53:42.120 --> 53:45.960]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my old sponsors you can
[53:45.960 --> 53:50.560]  get more information at www dot my solar backup dot com that's my solar
[53:50.560 --> 53:54.440]  backup dot com remember the government doesn't own the sun should go to my
[53:54.440 --> 54:22.320]  solar backup dot com or call 1-877-327-0365
[54:22.320 --> 54:26.160]  what do we do when tyrants wrap themselves in the flag and when the
[54:26.160 --> 54:32.880]  band plays how to the chief lot no point wait the cannon at you all right
[54:32.880 --> 54:36.400]  let me get back into the news here and then coming up the next hour is gonna
[54:36.400 --> 54:40.280]  be jam packed with all the other news and a little special report we're doing on
[54:40.280 --> 54:44.920]  police all over the country being ordered to go after camera people and
[54:44.920 --> 54:48.520]  again it's it's who's in control of the police it's the policies that are the
[54:48.520 --> 54:53.600]  problem not the individual police I got to be honest in my experience is
[54:53.600 --> 54:59.320]  nationwide with police Los Angeles Dallas even Chicago they've been very
[54:59.320 --> 55:03.960]  nice and professional in New York it's been horrible Pittsburgh it's been
[55:03.960 --> 55:09.160]  horrible Kansas City's federal security guards horrible but but I'm gonna get
[55:09.160 --> 55:13.040]  into that report the point is by and large they're good men and women but
[55:13.040 --> 55:17.320]  what they're being told to do is was why in every poll the public is starting to
[55:17.320 --> 55:23.120]  hate the police now I'm gonna cover global economic news military news
[55:23.120 --> 55:27.640]  constitutional crisis news next hour but before you go they're finishing up
[55:27.640 --> 55:34.200]  with the TSA and how it ties into the drudge report leading the fight we've
[55:34.200 --> 55:38.680]  got red state the big Republican mainline neocon thing saying drudge is
[55:38.680 --> 55:45.960]  discredited linking to our articles because we say that Perry is a
[55:45.960 --> 55:50.080]  presidential front-runner without announcing we said that Monday and we
[55:50.080 --> 55:56.120]  said it a year ago and we said it last week and then now we have CNBC London
[55:56.120 --> 56:00.840]  Guardian and others that have done focus groups polls and have found that after I
[56:00.840 --> 56:08.040]  told you that I mean I can look at Perry and how he operates and what he says
[56:08.040 --> 56:12.640]  and does just like I'm a good bass fisherman I mean I know what lures are
[56:12.640 --> 56:16.440]  gonna work folks I can look at that lure and I can tell you that's the best one
[56:16.440 --> 56:25.720]  they got okay but I'm discredited because I can think for myself and I'm also
[56:25.720 --> 56:30.920]  discredited because my writers wrote an article today with a flashback to our
[56:30.920 --> 56:36.320]  articles from from from April 13th my member was right without even reading
[56:36.320 --> 56:40.480]  the article it was in April and November in November last year now what eight
[56:40.480 --> 56:47.680]  months ago in November and then again in April the TSA came out we have links to
[56:47.680 --> 56:51.200]  the to the announcements their press releases and said no more enhanced
[56:51.200 --> 56:55.880]  pat downs for kids under 12 see my memory served 12 years old second
[56:55.880 --> 57:01.680]  paragraph right there from the TSA spokespersons press release there it is
[57:01.680 --> 57:06.880]  oh by the way that's not in full wars or prison planet that is saying that that's
[57:06.880 --> 57:11.500]  USA today and in fact red state and others will say that's not USA today so
[57:11.500 --> 57:15.800]  please shrink it down so they can see the headline now according to them we're
[57:15.800 --> 57:18.920]  lying you know according to them we're evil ladies and gentlemen according to
[57:18.920 --> 57:22.800]  them you know we we make stuff up we're cooks we don't have credibility of course
[57:22.800 --> 57:27.240]  we do we're right a lot more often than the mainstream lying media because we
[57:27.240 --> 57:32.400]  try to tell the truth we try to really analyze things is there a way because I
[57:32.400 --> 57:35.320]  think it's the printer friendly you're showing to show the whole USA today to
[57:35.320 --> 57:40.400]  present planet dot TV viewers you know with the USA today top banner up there
[57:40.400 --> 57:43.400]  I want to just minimize that article so they can see that there it is okay
[57:43.400 --> 57:50.560]  USA today travel section and who's it reported by I get the reporter as I'll
[57:50.560 --> 57:55.000]  say it you call reporter TSA put the press release out this is real we're

[58:05.520 --> 58:10.200]  bother pronounce my own name sorry and it says children going through airport
[58:10.200 --> 58:13.880]  security will no longer be subject to the aggressive pat downs that have riled
[58:13.880 --> 58:21.280]  some passengers and will instead face less intrusive hand searches from
[58:21.280 --> 58:26.960]  screeners the transportation security administration said Tuesday and then we
[58:26.960 --> 58:30.520]  have the link in our article to the press release so so there's drugs just
[58:30.520 --> 58:35.280]  credited again linking to our article showing that they've lied when they come
[58:35.280 --> 58:38.760]  out and now say again they're not going to evasive pat downs of children we're
[58:38.760 --> 58:50.760]  just this is gcn the Genesis communications radio network this is
[58:50.760 --> 58:54.120]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[58:54.120 --> 58:58.080]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[58:58.080 --> 59:02.360]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[59:02.360 --> 59:06.600]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[59:06.600 --> 59:10.960]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[59:10.960 --> 59:14.880]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[59:14.880 --> 59:19.600]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[59:19.600 --> 59:23.720]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[59:23.720 --> 59:27.720]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[59:27.720 --> 59:31.520]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[59:31.520 --> 59:34.240]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[59:34.240 --> 59:39.200]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at WWW dot my

[59:51.640 --> 01:00:05.960]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network big brother
[01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:13.280]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:21.400]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:34.000]  there's a key video up at info wars dot com title world war three defined dealing
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.880]  with the expanding wars in the Middle East there's a drudge report linked
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:45.440]  article if you just joined us where the TSA says pat down procedures for young
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:50.800]  kids will be ended as of this week the problem is and we just showed it to
[01:00:50.800 --> 01:01:00.040]  folks on the last segment if you just joined us again USA Today article from
[01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:07.640]  November of 2010 with the headline TSA chief new pat downs necessary actually
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:12.200]  this printed the wrong one you put put it back on screen for me thanks you still
[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:16.040]  got it I can't keep track of all this there it is no enhanced pat downs for
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:28.440]  kids TSA and the date on that was 11 17 2010 so there you go and then they did
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:31.040]  it again in April and we have links to those articles in our article that's
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:35.920]  linked on drudge so the issue here is they lie and they premeditatedly lie
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:41.640]  and and why if you say no you're not gonna grow up my child because this has
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:46.400]  happened to state representatives we've interviewed and Congress people and it's
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:51.280]  happened to their children since the ban went into effect they're not stopping
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:55.320]  I've witnessed it why then are they lying why are they telling you they've
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:02:01.640]  stopped it if they haven't stopped it and I tend to just get stuck on these
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:07.040]  points I was talking to Colonel Craig Roberts great patriot he's gonna be
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:14.120]  joining us I need to remind not remind I haven't told him yet Roberts keeps
[01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:17.600]  making pocket calls to my phone cuz Alex Jones is the first number in his
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:22.520]  phone I said I said well I said hey buddy you just pocket called me again
[01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:27.440]  called him up yesterday and I said you're coming on the show and he said
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:34.520]  alright he doesn't do radio anymore really but he's taking care of his
[01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:39.640]  like he said his wife's dad World War two vet 87 years old so he's at their
[01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:43.480]  house right now he's gonna be back next week we're gonna get him on and talk
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:50.280]  about a host of issues but I'll also get him to talk about a subject we don't
[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:53.720]  usually get into a lot we don't get into the paranormal and things and either
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:58.680]  this Colonel Craig Roberts but he did die I think it was for 10 minutes on the
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:05.960]  operating table for cancer more than a decade ago now and had quite an
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:12.720]  experience you know the whole angel the whole nine yards and I've no other
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:16.480]  people I've had family that have had similar experiences and other cultures
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:22.320]  have it that people that aren't Christians have the same experiences and
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:25.680]  they've dug up Chinese text and others from over a thousand years ago before
[01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:29.360]  they ever had contact with Westerners where their their writers wrote about
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:33.520]  people dying and having that same experience I just find it very
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:39.920]  interesting it was a movie directed came out last year forget the name of it
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:47.920]  Matt Damon's in it about dying and then the people that have died than having
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:04:00.040]  this more powerful spiritual connection to things but I'm now digressing off in
[01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:03.360]  other areas that's the kind of stuff I don't get into because you can't prove it
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:05.520]  one way or the other but it's just interesting and every time I get Robert
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:09.240]  songs it's hard to get him on the radio he's retired and he didn't want to mess
[01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:13.920]  you a Colonel in the Army SWAT team commander police helicopter pilot I
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:18.840]  mean a real deal he's a great guy Marine Corps sniper highly decorated
[01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:24.720]  Vietnam I could go on and on best-selling author and it's always great to get
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:28.600]  Robert song but I had to really twist his arm so we're supposed to call him
[01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:34.080]  Monday at 9 30 a.m. to decide what day and come on Monday or Tuesday he said he
[01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:39.360]  do it but I had to really beg so I'll try to get him on actually shut up and
[01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:43.040]  let him talk to I get excited though I guess like that they never shut up you
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:47.040]  know that it's why I'm a talk show host all right shifting gears completely into

[01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:23.520]  alex jones
[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:34.440]  all right my friends we're eight minutes and 30 seconds in an hour number two
[01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:39.640]  coming up is the guy who blew me away by how funny he was I've seen him on
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:44.800]  national TV heard his radio show before but he requested it at the talkers
[01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:49.000]  2011 new media conference where I was the keynote speaker which is pretty
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.680]  illustrious there's been people like russian limbaugh is the keynote speaker
[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:57.880]  in the key notes speaker in the past and Lionel introduced me and I got to know
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:03.160]  him and talk to him off and on for a few hours and he just hilarious and he
[01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:09.080]  listens to the show he's a comedian lawyer and I haven't done any pre-
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:12.040]  interview with him I haven't talked to him since I saw him in New York jaren
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:16.160]  set him up but we're gonna talk about a host of issues but maybe I can get him
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:20.960]  to tell some jokes about the show in fact I meant to tell him to or to tell
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:25.360]  jaren to roast us you might try to call Lionel now and give him a 50 minute heads
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:30.600]  up and and and well he's so off the cuff he'll be able to roast us on air but he
[01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:34.280]  sat there with a crowd around us for about 20 minutes after my speech out in
[01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:40.160]  the four year with Steven Baldwin of people out there and former congressman
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:44.080]  JD Hayworth they were all watching this go on and I should have gotten on video
[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:48.800]  but I didn't think to tell do to do it for like 20 minutes he just told joke
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:54.720]  after joke about my radio show that was so hilarious because he's a listener a
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:10:01.320]  regular listener and he knew all the stories it's true it was funny so I
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:05.520]  should have given that heads up but in case he had notes or something from it
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:10.200]  because it was so well delivered it was like incredible stand-up right there
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:14.240]  just with a group of people around us standing there that I didn't ask him but
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:17.600]  I thought this had to be written maybe this is something he wrote that he
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:21.240]  didn't then use in the introduction because he did have some you know a
[01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:28.000]  written speech to introduce me but maybe some lighter fare next hour I mean I
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:32.240]  don't know what Lionel wants to cover we fly by the seat of our pants here so I
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:37.520]  didn't instruct my crew to tell him anything just get him on so that's
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:44.720]  coming up in the third hour today oh man well I'm not gonna even try to tell his
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:49.080]  jokes because I wouldn't I'm not intentionally funny I think people have
[01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:52.480]  noticed that sometimes I am funny but it's it's an accident it's not
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:57.880]  intentional so I'm not gonna butcher his material before he joins us plus I
[01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:01.400]  think he thinks he's coming on about his idea we talked to Sharon today was to
[01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:05.080]  talk about how police are arresting people for videotaping him and how as a
[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:10.520]  lawyer he can document how absurd that is but we'll talk to the syndicated
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:14.840]  radio host TV host coming up next hour okay let me get into all the really
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:23.040]  serious news now that I've dispensed with some of the pleasantries there let
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:28.160]  me just read you a smattering of some of what we're going to get into this
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:32.080]  hour and you're like here he goes again he'll hit the first article and then
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:35.520]  talk about that for an hour we'll never hear the rest of it but here it is a
[01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:42.520]  sinister cyber surveillance scheme exposed and I'm not saying I did the
[01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:47.560]  research for this but or Paul Watson did but we going back four years ago
[01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:52.360]  exposed the cyber security surveillance system because the government put press
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:12:01.360]  releases out via MIT and others and it's really exciting to now know that
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:07.160]  people are seeing what's hidden in plain view and I happen to be listening to
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:11.920]  Katherine Albrecht I was driving about two weeks ago and I missed most of it
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:19.440]  and she went to a big top was it New York bar Association speech and the
[01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:23.720]  keynote speaker there I believe she said was the head of the or one of the heads
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:27.880]  the Electronic Frontier Foundation about big brother and and and she was
[01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:31.840]  pointing out that Alex Jones and info wars calm she said the speaker said
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:36.760]  this from her circles was leading the way and exposing this architecture well
[01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:43.200]  as usual I'm not smart okay I just have a good memory it's the same thing with
[01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:47.800]  the TSA when we see them sticking their hands down people's pants and then they
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:51.480]  say they're not doing it in November it was only a matter of time till video
[01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:55.720]  came out showing they were liars or when they say in November and they then say
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:13:01.720]  in April we are going to stop as of now groping children under 12 and they never
[01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:06.400]  stop and they come out and say it again today I'm not smart to be able to go hey
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:10.920]  they already said this two other times and never did it I'm not smart when the
[01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:16.920]  Pentagon puts out reports to themselves but they're not classified it's more
[01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:19.680]  you know inside baseball reports but it's not secret you just got to want to go
[01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:23.880]  read it where they described global revolution implosion world government
[01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:28.840]  world bank microchips in the population when we link to those reports on the
[01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:33.200]  site where they talk about cyber security in the four branches of the
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:36.800]  military running all the internet and having kill switches and everything and
[01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:40.160]  how the government's going to send you messages over your cell phone and break
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:43.600]  in on your TV so I tell you four or five years ago that's going to happen and
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:48.120]  then they come out this last month and announce it they told us they would do
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:52.360]  it I mean that's what's so frustrating about this is that I'm actually not
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:56.200]  flattered that the keynote speaker at the at the at the New York bar
[01:13:56.200 --> 01:14:00.920]  association was saying how great I am and how smart I am look I'm not bashing
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:06.960]  you for the nice words but I'm not I'm not that smart I mean I've got good old
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:11.520]  Texas common sense I guess you could say I mean I'm not here to be conned or
[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:15.280]  ripped off or manipulate I didn't just fall off the turnip truck yesterday if
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:18.440]  you walk up to me and punch me in the nose I'm going to punch you back you
[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:26.960]  try to take my property through taxes I'm going to get angry about it I mean
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:30.680]  it's really simple all right all right I said I get to the news big London
[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:36.200]  Guardian report and it just goes on to say hacked emails from security
[01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:40.280]  coordinator from the federal level to when the British and US government
[01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:44.560]  reveal a disturbing public-private partnership to spy on users that's
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:49.160]  because the NSA technology has been given to all these major technology
[01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:53.600]  companies Google was created by the government that's mainline information
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:58.480]  people are like this nut thinks Google's the government it was in QTEL money and
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:02.720]  other government funding directly that started the stinking thing Google is an
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:10.160]  NSA keyword search system sorry excuse me and the article just goes through
[01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:16.640]  all of it in detail and it's as if we wrote the article so look I love this I
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:21.960]  don't I don't get upset when Glenn Beck starts covering agenda 21 I'm not some
[01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:25.240]  competitive talk show hosts that like look at Glenn Beck he's now exposing the
[01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:31.240]  UN the regulation takeover using zoning and carbon taxes to create a global
[01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:38.320]  standardized system why I'm I covered agenda 21 16 years ago no I'm like great
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:46.760]  good see we don't territorialize information but I don't like is Glenn
[01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:50.360]  Beck telling you that George Soros runs it all when he's certainly a kingpin he
[01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:54.720]  doesn't run at all all right side issue I'm now digressing but I don't like his
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:59.320]  Glenn Beck I saw a video clip when I was researching last night for this piece
[01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:03.280]  I'm gonna get to later in the hour of all these video clips of police
[01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:07.840]  arrested people for videotaping including mainstream camera people who are very
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:13.600]  polite and nice and cops run up and say get out of here and reporters don't move
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:17.560]  fast enough so they arrest them and shove them and abuse them and it's like
[01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:22.160]  mainline truck with guys with cameras from the local news station going what
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:27.760]  are you doing man what's going on we're just trying to film the overturned 18
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:33.040]  wheeler a hundred yards away we all this is what our job okay we'll go nope you
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:38.440]  didn't move fast enough I mean it's it's crazy and it's happening more and more
[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:44.640]  where is this attitude coming from federal security guards off the
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:48.520]  Federal Reserve half mile away come over and say leave with their hands on their
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:54.120]  guns we're like but we're getting a long shot for a film we're making we said go
[01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:57.920]  putting their hands on their guns you understand you will be arrested well you
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:01.480]  don't have the authority to do that but okay we'll go because we don't want to
[01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:06.040]  have a confrontation with you but you should act like adults so that's coming
[01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:13.360]  up at the bottom of the hour and and quite frankly I don't even want to do
[01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:19.400]  this a I can't do justice to it be if I don't explain this exactly right if I
[01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:26.040]  don't hit this with a hole in one when I talk about the cops if I do it lazily
[01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:29.560]  it will help the New World Order and I'll explain that as I get into the piece
[01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:36.520]  coming up in about 15 minutes because as I learn more about how this stuff
[01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:43.600]  operates I see where I play into things I don't want to be an enemy of police that
[01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:47.040]  you cannot deny in third world countries and Nazi Germany and China
[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:52.400]  everybody knows that oh other countries police are bad and corrupt ours are good
[01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:56.440]  well our police have been some of the best in the world because they were in a
[01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:59.560]  country that had a Bill of Rights Constitution and a culture of freedom and
[01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:06.080]  they came from families where they would be disowned and shunned if they did the
[01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:11.160]  types of things police routinely do today so it's a process of America losing
[01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:15.560]  its soul and it's not just the police that are losing their soul America is
[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:21.160]  losing its soul so our police are going to lose their soul and the system is
[01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:28.040]  protecting and trying to turn police into mad control freak enforcers and not
[01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:35.200]  defenders of the Republic so that's coming up now there's that article
[01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:40.920]  breaking all that down from the Guardian how it's just a total grid of total
[01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:46.080]  control with no fourth amendment no nothing and how it's meant to shut the
[01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:51.040]  web off whenever they want filter out what you can see oh by the way speaking
[01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:57.160]  of that we had a victory I put YouTube on notice privately and publicly that I
[01:18:57.160 --> 01:19:04.080]  was considering litigation against Google not to win any money but to expose
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:08.520]  what they're doing for violating their terms of service agreement with us and
[01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:15.280]  for saying we violated their terms of service when we didn't and basically
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:21.320]  that's unfair trade practices and false advertising and they sent us a letter
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:27.720]  here and they removed the racism claim strike that had taken our honors away
[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:35.680]  that took us off many of the main pages and so we've got that letter from Dave
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:39.000]  who runs the YouTube channel our official channel the hundred and now
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:43.520]  right at 18 million views 118 million views that one channel that they have
[01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:49.440]  removed the claim that we're racist for talking bad about Obama and saying hang
[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:56.720]  up posters of Obama as the Joker so oh and also Dutch populace wilders

[01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:06.840]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:11.640]  because there's a war on for your mind
[01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:26.840]  okay number one you know Obama gave a speech last night saying that now over
[01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:30.800]  time they're going to draw down the amount of troops in Afghanistan and of
[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:34.280]  course just send them to other countries that are in the process of being
[01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:39.120]  invaded well this is the same type of pledge we got when he was a candidate
[01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:42.480]  and then when he first got into office he said we'll be out of Afghanistan
[01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:46.320]  within one year we'll be totally out of Iraq within a year and then it was 18
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:51.640]  months then it was two years and all they did was take the main combat
[01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:56.600]  brigades and stop calling them combat brigades and call them combat support
[01:24:56.600 --> 01:25:04.040]  brigades and then they augmented that with more mercenaries and basically it's
[01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:09.640]  a little slicker form of bush on the aircraft carrier with the codpiece saying
[01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:14.600]  mission accomplished and landing I was watching Fox News and they said look at
[01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:19.600]  him he really was a fighter pilot he's such a hero look he's incredible you
[01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:23.080]  got this giant codpiece and he's walking around like the guy going to the metal
[01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:27.600]  detector in Wayne's world I mean it was ridiculous and obviously that was just
[01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:35.600]  what six weeks into it the war has now gone on for eight plus years and a lot
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:40.560]  of the media is pointing this out Afghan army success can not mask fears of what
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:44.440]  happens when the US goes despite the progress made by home-trained soldiers
[01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:49.160]  there are worries the Taliban will quickly fill the void the Taliban
[01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:54.360]  originally worked with the United States in the 80s most of the quote Taliban
[01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:59.160]  we're not the internal CIA type Taliban a lot in fact the head of the Taliban
[01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:04.080]  said we don't believe we did this and show proof and if we can find bin Laden
[01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:07.400]  we'll help arrest him and they said no you did it we're invading and then
[01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:11.760]  separately Saddam actually did it too so we're gonna look there's mobile weapons
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:21.560]  trucks and the airplanes they trained in all lies now confirmed but here is the
[01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:26.600]  national journal reporting on the quasi withdrawal Obama's choice a partial
[01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:31.960]  exit with reelection in mind yes the fact is he can't have all these other
[01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:38.640]  new wars if he doesn't at least pay lip service to a partial withdrawal but
[01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:44.960]  instead of a withdrawal we've had the opposite and yes first Obama said he
[01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:49.040]  would get us out of Iraq and Afghanistan then once he got about a month
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:53.160]  away from election in 2008 he suddenly said no no no we're gonna leave Iraq
[01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:58.480]  entirely and finish the job in Afghanistan so there's been lots of
[01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:02.720]  flipping and flopping not just one way or the other but in all different
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:09.360]  directions just jumping around like an insane frog or something don't kid
[01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:14.960]  yourself president Obama's decision to withdraw 30,000 troops 33,000 troops
[01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:20.480]  well he me that's how many he roughly added in the last two years from Afghanistan
[01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:24.400]  before he stands for reelection is not driven by the United States position of
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:28.720]  strength in a war zone as much as it's by grim economic and political realities
[01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:34.360]  at home how is this ending the Afghan war when actually if you added up all
[01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:43.040]  the surges into Afghanistan of memory serves it was 55,000 troops in his first
[01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:49.240]  year in office they added and I haven't kept track of the extra mercenaries but
[01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:55.800]  it's just it's all a complete lie oh you're gonna pull less than two-thirds
[01:27:55.800 --> 01:28:00.320]  of the extra troops you put in oh that's the end of the war and you're and
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:03.880]  and you're gonna expand the drones and other things in the Pakistan oh this is
[01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:08.960]  a well there you go we kept his campaign promise he's ending the wars because the
[01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:14.800]  troops are staying that'd be like if I said I'm gonna stop punching you in the
[01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:23.520]  face or and then I punch you five times and I mean we'll read the five fine
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:27.880]  print I won't punch it ten times in the face not punching you in the face means
[01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:33.800]  I'm only gonna punch you in the face five times it's just it's it's like the
[01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:41.000]  TSA saying see they're programming people's brains they know the public's
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:45.280]  bear barely paying attention so they say that weapons of mass destruction were
[01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:48.560]  found in Iraq as more than half of conservatives and major polls believe
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:52.680]  that they believe WMDs were found I still hear it on talk radio they believe
[01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:57.480]  they were found even the White House admits they weren't about 55% depending
[01:28:57.480 --> 01:29:01.920]  on the poll it's around that of conservatives believe WMDs were found
[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:06.400]  and they still may like with the fake bin Laden thing pull a rabbit out of the
[01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:10.680]  hat and you know find a nuke or something with Maiden Iran on the side of it
[01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:15.160]  and Ahmed Denizide certainly helping he he's out running around today saying we
[01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:19.920]  may want to have a nuke in fact we have the will to build a nuke that a nuclear
[01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:31.960]  weapon that's a really good idea Iran escalating things oh okay I haven't got
[01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:36.720]  in the latest in Libya and then the really big news here is the fact that
[01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:43.440]  Bernanke Osama Ben Bernanke is girl Salante likes to call him says economic
[01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:48.880]  trouble puzzles Fed chief to he's puzzled by what they've engineered by design on
[01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:55.920]  record stay with us we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and
[01:29:55.920 --> 01:30:02.960]  the GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:07.400]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:11.400]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:15.320]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:19.320]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:23.880]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:27.880]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:31.680]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:35.360]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:39.680]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[01:32:56.480 --> 01:33:24.960]  quality at prison planet TV all right I want to speak directly to police
[01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:30.480]  officers not just here in the United States all over the world because you
[01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:36.400]  were selected by the social engineers for a certain psychological profile you
[01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:41.720]  are manipulated into a gang mentality of the world is against you and so you've
[01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:47.760]  got to stick together and you are put into a culture of corruption now that
[01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:52.920]  was not always the case here in the United States but more and more the
[01:33:52.920 --> 01:33:57.920]  classical systems that governments and social engineers have developed to
[01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:07.680]  produce a tack dog thug like secret police legions has been done what the
[01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:11.400]  communist Chinese did what the Nazis did what the Russians do what Latin
[01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:16.840]  American countries do Americans know instinctively I'd say close to a hundred
[01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:21.080]  percent that most third world countries in eastern European nations and African
[01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:25.960]  countries the police are corrupt they are thug like they are dangerous they
[01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:30.440]  are the mafia and they work for the ruling elite and if you don't know
[01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:33.920]  that you haven't traveled around the world you haven't studied history and
[01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:39.080]  you hadn't been shaken down by a Mexican cop you hadn't seen the turbos pulled
[01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:45.080]  over and the poor turbos driver begging to not have every bit of money taken
[01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:49.560]  from him that he's to feed his family with and the you know troops giggling
[01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:53.520]  and laughing or the police giggling and laughing and enjoying the crime they're
[01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:58.360]  committing now that's why you got to stay on the police and that's why more
[01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:02.320]  importantly you got to stay on the people that run the police because in
[01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:07.240]  every case in history it is a uniform that will come to your door to bring
[01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:12.840]  you tyranny tyranny comes the door in uniform also republics and liberty is
[01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:17.680]  throughout history been defended by a uniform so you've got a choice here at
[01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:24.200]  this crossroads to decide what side you want to be on now that said if we just
[01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:28.600]  get up on air and make this a sport of attacking police it actually helps the
[01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:35.320]  globalist there's a reason on Fox and CNN and MSNBC the most popular thing they
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:41.680]  show is police brutality videos and cops doing outrageous things and some
[01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:47.800]  host defend it some don't but overall you think why would the system want to put
[01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:53.760]  that out well a it's entertaining and it gets ratings but be cops then start
[01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:57.480]  being hated by the entire population this is psych warfare police so please
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:36:01.120]  listen and the general public needs to listen if you want to understand how
[01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:03.960]  things work I'm sure a lot of you've already figured this out but if you want
[01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:07.400]  to understand your your profession and what's going on I'm gonna give you the
[01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:13.840]  little secrets here okay when they constantly air footage of police being
[01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:18.200]  brutal police being arrogant police being bad I know that that is the
[01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:24.120]  minority of police but the training and the overall culture generally trends
[01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:28.440]  towards that so they show it to you to a condition the public to accept it to be
[01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:35.280]  to condition cops to become callous and buy into my gosh it is a thin blue line
[01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:40.200]  or a thin black ski mask line a thin checkpoint your stopo line we better
[01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:46.680]  only stick together in our gang in our you know group and you and cops you've
[01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:51.520]  all read gang psychology handbooks will take that look at yourselves so they
[01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:56.080]  want you to be a street gang and not people that are guardians of the
[01:36:56.080 --> 01:37:00.480]  Republic peace officers who understand that you are there to serve and that
[01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:04.840]  that's not disempowering to be a servant that is truly powerful and what is
[01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:09.200]  important that's honorable that's the warrior defending the tribe who's been
[01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:14.160]  designated by the people by the tribe you're part of the tribe well they want
[01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:20.720]  to break that up they want to separate you from being a true guardian to being
[01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:26.040]  a arrogant person that thinks they're a guardian but really is part of a cult
[01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:31.120]  that's why you don't hear a lot of police brutality that when I finally see it I
[01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:34.560]  tend to be intellectually lazy I'm sick of it I'm threatened at a primitive
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:40.800]  animal level I get angry and I you know yell and scream and it's entertaining
[01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:44.640]  but you know years ago it was a cop bashing fest just A to Z on the show
[01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:49.120]  till I became more sophisticated five six years ago and I still get mad I still
[01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:53.640]  get infuriated by by the thugs they show us doing this the the out-of-control
[01:37:53.640 --> 01:37:58.600]  criminals with a badge treating us like we're not even human and framing people
[01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:03.840]  on camera slamming people's heads for no reason into the ground and and then and
[01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:08.480]  then charging them with felonies of assaulting the cops that makes my
[01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:16.880]  blood boil now and there's a bunch of examples of that we've got today but I
[01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:20.040]  want when I saw this yesterday and I see this stuff all the time I don't even
[01:38:20.040 --> 01:38:24.280]  really push my people to post this on info wars in prison planet though we
[01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:28.400]  need to regardless so we do and I did call Kurt last night I said I saw this
[01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:31.400]  this morning we haven't posted it post the police officer arrest woman in her
[01:38:31.400 --> 01:38:35.280]  front yard for filming cops and I see this all the time cops will come to your
[01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:38.640]  house sometimes the wrong house and if you have surveillance cameras on your
[01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:44.120]  house I know I do some a public figure they get mad and arrest you and charge
[01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:47.480]  you for filming them claiming it's eavesdropping when the statutes are all
[01:38:47.480 --> 01:38:51.600]  clear you you can have hidden things on your own property outside your property
[01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:56.440]  as long as it's in plain view or even hidden there's no perception a reasonable
[01:38:56.440 --> 01:39:01.720]  reasonable perception of privacy that's why they they say they can film you at
[01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:05.200]  sports stadiums or on the highway or how cops film you from their squad car
[01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:08.760]  because it's a public area you don't have any perception of privacy now if I
[01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:12.200]  go up to your window or a cop does with the camera and films through your blinds
[01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:17.880]  your wife in the shower that's that's a serious crime the government spy on you
[01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:22.360]  without a warrant that that's that's a crime just like if a peeping Tom does it
[01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:27.160]  in fact under the statutes it's even worse because it's the official system
[01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:31.800]  doing it which our common law recognizes is extremely dangerous now I better
[01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:36.640]  shut up and get to these videos the point is that I wasn't going to cover
[01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:42.520]  this until I heard some talking point on radio defending it on national shows
[01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:47.280]  multiple shows then I went and found Beck doing it what I'd heard and I went
[01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:52.520]  and found him saying she could be Van Jones cops these people filming you may
[01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:57.440]  want to kill you 40 something cops have died this year it's terrible but I looked
[01:39:57.440 --> 01:40:00.680]  up the number several hundred have died in auto accidents so so you ought to be
[01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:04.200]  afraid of that before they get you all and it's so easy psychologically to go
[01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:08.280]  cops I love you I don't want you to get killed these people videotaping you were
[01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:14.120]  evil they're with Van Jones I mean that is so elementary so ridiculous that
[01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:18.400]  that someone and then and Beck went on and said it's terrible she she
[01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:25.720]  videotaped her neighbor having their stuff thrown out on the curb in in a
[01:40:25.720 --> 01:40:29.320]  foreclosure he's the guy that supported the banker bailout and I was just like
[01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:33.800]  now she's bad to videotape the neighbor having their stuff thrown out and she
[01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:40.280]  was arrested before for this she may be Van Jones with no proof just the guy
[01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:45.440]  he demonizes Van Jones and I thought I was listening to something from another
[01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:49.600]  dimension and I don't even want to bash Beck then I heard another show doing it
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:54.520]  so so now they're trying to say this type of behavior is not only acceptable
[01:40:54.520 --> 01:41:00.920]  and he said the cop to the right thing but good this woman is probably 20 yards
[01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:05.320]  from the from the she backs up more and the cop goes ahead and arrest her and
[01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:09.120]  I know this case is nothing compared to what's happened to my reporters what's
[01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:12.600]  happened to other mainline news reporters and here's the problem you go to
[01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:17.440]  YouTube alone and you type in police arrest camera person or man you will
[01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:22.040]  get thousands of links most of them are duplicates and I've forgotten wait
[01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:25.680]  there's Rob do getting arrested in the links some of the top ones there's
[01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:30.920]  Aaron and Rob in Kansas City with security guards a half mile from the
[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:33.800]  fellow reserve Chen why are you why are you over here at this world war one
[01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:37.080]  memorial videotaping fellow reserve oh we're we're making a film we're here in
[01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:41.680]  town and we it's about banking uh get out of here well you don't have a story
[01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:48.600]  to do that well I got a gun leave or it's gonna get bad I mean this was this
[01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:53.080]  wasn't even a cop these were security guards you work for us you work for the
[01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:58.440]  people you are empowered by the state constitutions we hire you you you weren't
[01:41:58.440 --> 01:42:01.960]  for us you don't just walk up and say get off your front lawn go in your house
[01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:07.440]  you don't just walk up and I mean now they got federal state courts ruling
[01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:11.040]  that come in your house without warrants now for any reason or no reason at all
[01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:15.320]  I mean we have states we have a bill of rights for a reason because if you don't
[01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:20.160]  have checks and balances you become North Korea or Mexico and they're trying
[01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:24.600]  to teach the cops all over the country I see them beat up camera people in
[01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:28.000]  Miami if somebody videotapes them shooting somebody they come up and pull
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:31.680]  guns on them and take their camera and beat them up or they shoot the guy in
[01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:34.760]  the back and then lie about it and say he was in handcuffs and what sets me
[01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:39.800]  about a lot of these articles especially the one out of Las Vegas is this guy is
[01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:42.800]  videotaping from a house he was house sitting so he technically didn't really
[01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:46.760]  lie first he says do you live here we'll know and the cops are he goes well
[01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:51.400]  actually I do I mean and then they said oh you're lying and beat him up but the
[01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:55.920]  point is didn't matter if he was lying the cop beats him up stomps his head in
[01:42:55.920 --> 01:43:00.320]  the guy to go to the hospital and the cop charges him with felony assault on
[01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:04.600]  the officer when it turns out the cop was so arrogant he didn't even erase the
[01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:09.240]  video that's what's scary is it and that's what the National French TV said
[01:43:09.240 --> 01:43:14.240]  in English they said memo to cops if you're gonna beat up camera men erase
[01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:19.840]  the tape I mean this cop who it turns out killed two people one of them who
[01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:24.480]  was mentally ill so he's definitely you know a macho guy some of these guys
[01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:27.160]  aren't cowards wanting power some of them are people that actually like to
[01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:30.840]  fight and kill and they're they're mad dogs and then those are the types you
[01:43:30.840 --> 01:43:35.040]  don't want either you don't want little thug cowards and you don't want
[01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:39.840]  wild men who just are ready to beat everybody up you want tough guys who
[01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:44.480]  want to defend people who are smart that's what you want police I mean I'll
[01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:47.760]  be honest about women police and I'm sure there's some nice ones almost every
[01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:51.640]  bad experience I've had has been with female cops because they're scared for
[01:43:51.640 --> 01:43:56.480]  no reason they they immediately if you even talk to them and I don't cower
[01:43:56.480 --> 01:44:02.840]  freak out freak out but side issue look you're getting into all this psychology
[01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:05.800]  let's just start going to these clips one after the other listen there's
[01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:09.560]  thousands of these and this isn't to demonize police I had to I have to
[01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:14.080]  cover this now because because cops do you want your kids growing up in a
[01:44:14.080 --> 01:44:19.600]  country like this where you're God and the people have no rights because
[01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:22.520]  you're one of us whether you know it or not they may have taught you that you're
[01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:27.080]  separate from society you're not Bubba they put GMO in your food they put
[01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:30.240]  fluoride in your water and and all over the country they're stealing your
[01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:34.680]  pension funds so you better grow up just like the public should right now and
[01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:38.120]  realize what's happening so let's start going to these clips here's the first
[01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:42.400]  one from a couple days ago and you can watch the whole video it's up at info
[01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:50.000]  wars.com and I don't know she's probably actually about 12 yards 15 yards away
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:56.680]  here but she's in her own yard and I I've read the statutes he could have
[01:44:56.680 --> 01:45:02.120]  said you're interfering in a police investigation please get back but he
[01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:05.360]  can't tell her get in her house and the thing is the woman starts moving back
[01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:09.440]  it's kind of like running from a dog and humans have similar psychology to dogs
[01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:13.600]  that's why we bring them into our houses when you run from the dog then it
[01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:18.800]  attacks and that's my experience with police at demonstrations and things it's
[01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:22.480]  actually when you grovel that that you're in big trouble it's it's it's a
[01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:27.960]  weird psychology and police shouldn't behave like that but again I'm getting
[01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:31.160]  down into this the system wants to demonize police so they can break you
[01:45:31.160 --> 01:45:36.160]  off in your own cult now here's the club of the woman being arrested I'm gonna
[01:45:36.160 --> 01:45:39.640]  stand in my yard if that's okay
[01:45:39.640 --> 01:45:46.040]  do what you said to me before you started taping I think you need to stay in
[01:45:46.040 --> 01:45:49.160]  your house guys what did I say to you that offended you I'm standing behind us
[01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:53.520]  officers we're doing a traffic stop I'm allowed to stand in my yard stand in

[01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.960]  one more time we don't feel safe with you standing right behind us when we're
[01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:05.840]  doing traffic stop I'm gonna ask you to go into the house what I it's my right
[01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:09.400]  to be in my yard and I'm sorry that you don't feel safe all I have is a camera
[01:46:09.400 --> 01:46:13.000]  I'm clearly wearing nothing I have no weapons it does not matter what you're
[01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:16.480]  you're not listening to our orders right now we don't feel safe with you standing
[01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:19.240]  behind us you're not moving even a foot further back you're gonna be you're gonna
[01:46:19.240 --> 01:46:22.480]  be you want me to move a foot further back she starts moving back you're gonna
[01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:25.360]  be under arrest they already warned you I will move a foot further back I don't
[01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:30.280]  not going to go inside my house I feel like I need the fresh air right now I'm
[01:46:30.280 --> 01:46:34.000]  arrest someone for not following police orders when we're asking you what the
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:38.840]  order I don't understand your order not stand behind us okay you didn't ask me
[01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:41.920]  to not stand behind you okay listen I'm not gonna explain myself to you what
[01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:43.800]  you're gonna do is you're gonna end up going to jail I'm trying to give you a
[01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:54.160]  warning okay I'm gonna back up you know what you're gonna go to jail that's not
[01:46:54.160 --> 01:47:01.920]  right stay right here I'm sorry all right and then I can't listen to it turn
[01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:06.360]  it off then she grovels and then in and says sir sir sir the guy doesn't deserve
[01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:10.560]  to be called sir at that point okay he needs to be calling you ma'am and sir
[01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:14.640]  and they need to because because because they are guardians of the Republic not
[01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:19.200]  our owners now the cop comes walking from around and they're trying I'm trying
[01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:22.920]  to get a hold of the lady but I'm I would imagine she said something like you
[01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:25.800]  know are you violent don't violate their rights for being videotaped and he says
[01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:31.240]  you're anti-police that's what they charge Kelly rushing with they said this
[01:47:31.240 --> 01:47:34.720]  video you're putting out one of my films giving police here officer this is
[01:47:34.720 --> 01:47:39.960]  important and then this was in the court transcripts the cops testified he said
[01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:43.840]  this video is important for you and your family to know about this this video is
[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:48.200]  anti-police and I feel him saying you and your family you know for you and your
[01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:51.940]  family to know about that that's a threat on my family and they tried to put
[01:47:51.940 --> 01:47:55.840]  him in prison in Kentucky the state police did this is the craziness oh
[01:47:55.840 --> 01:48:02.280]  you're anti-police and so now I'm gonna show you I don't know what she said
[01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:06.720]  because the you know the clip starts from there but he's not standing behind
[01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:11.560]  her she's not standing behind him he comes around she's backing up she's
[01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:17.480]  she's when she tries to leave he grabs her it's a power trip it's a joke now I
[01:48:17.480 --> 01:48:21.280]  could show you brutal examples of beating up people in wheelchairs and you
[01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:25.800]  know if I was put on a trial here to demonize police it wouldn't be hard but
[01:48:25.800 --> 01:48:32.080]  this next clip and it does have profanity a lot of it's bleeped out but it's got
[01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:35.280]  Gds and things in it but this is for documentation purposes so I'm not gonna
[01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:39.800]  play too much of it but the cop it's now been confirmed stomping kicked him in
[01:48:39.800 --> 01:48:43.040]  the nose the guy resisted in no way part of it's caught on video when his
[01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:50.600]  camera hits the ground and turns out this cop has killed two people and at
[01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:55.080]  first they defended it but but when the district attorney looked at it and that
[01:48:55.080 --> 01:48:59.400]  they last time I checked the cop was suspended because they fault they
[01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:03.480]  falsely charged the guy with assaulting the police and he was facing 10 to 15
[01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:09.560]  years in prison and this is that case from a few months ago in and there's
[01:49:09.560 --> 01:49:13.160]  new ones every day this is just one of the ones I pulled up again there's
[01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:18.760]  thousands of these in Las Vegas but but but again not only does he bloody and
[01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:23.400]  and beat this guy to a pulp kicking and stomping him he tells him don't resist
[01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:29.360]  while he beats him and listen pal if you like to get in fights go join a

[01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:19.360]  city park in Kansas City the Kansas City Star wrote about this it's not just
[01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:23.320]  our video and the Federal Reserve then lied and said we didn't send security
[01:55:23.320 --> 01:55:28.640]  guards over there and people are allowed to film our building and the Kansas City
[01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:33.760]  Star said but it's all on videotape see so their answer is nothing happened it
[01:55:33.760 --> 01:55:37.160]  doesn't exist kind of like the New York Times three and a half years ago said
[01:55:37.160 --> 01:55:42.200]  that I wasn't at Bilderberg that I was having a full schizophrenic breakdown at
[01:55:42.200 --> 01:55:47.120]  the Marriott in Virginia and was imagining cars following us and men
[01:55:47.120 --> 01:55:52.840]  behind trees yeah guys in suits with shaved heads driving by flipping us

[01:56:08.120 --> 01:56:12.760]  stopped it again the day and Obama put in 50,000 plus troops on top of the
[01:56:12.760 --> 01:56:16.880]  troops in Afghanistan and he's pulling out 33,000 of them so the war is over
[01:56:16.880 --> 01:56:23.160]  of course it's not over but hey they said so so okay sure got it thanks the next
[01:56:23.160 --> 01:56:27.720]  clip is just a short one the whole video is online but reporters threatened with

[02:00:34.280 --> 02:00:40.280]  been covering just the tip of the iceberg or the top molecule of ice at the
[02:00:40.280 --> 02:00:47.480]  tip of the iceberg of the thousands of videos thousands just of police arresting
[02:00:47.480 --> 02:00:51.680]  camera people in fact jaren there's one I forgot to send you or I think I sent
[02:00:51.680 --> 02:00:56.040]  it to you but I don't see it the printouts here it's the one in Texas
[02:00:56.040 --> 02:00:59.400]  where there's the overturned 18-wheeler and the main line news trucks there and
[02:00:59.400 --> 02:01:05.200]  the cop comes over and they're totally polite and they flip out on them and they
[02:01:05.200 --> 02:01:12.800]  and the people start trying to leave but and the cop goes ahead and arrest both
[02:01:12.800 --> 02:01:17.440]  the cameraman and the reporter and there's just countless of those including
[02:01:17.440 --> 02:01:23.320]  cops beating up mainline TV there'll be a big wreck and in one of the videos the
[02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:28.080]  news trucks there they're probably a hundred yards away to get the whole shot
[02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:33.280]  in the background on the nighttime one I think that was in Utah forget and the
[02:01:33.280 --> 02:01:38.680]  cops just come running over and they say get out of here and they go I'm just
[02:01:38.680 --> 02:01:42.920]  doing my job I'm here to film the wreck for the news and they go no you're not
[02:01:42.920 --> 02:01:51.600]  and just grab them tackle it's just like crazy these are crazy people and the
[02:01:51.600 --> 02:01:58.520]  police in most the cases try to defend this and why are the social engineers
[02:01:58.520 --> 02:02:02.920]  telling cops to defend this and and go along with it to make the public hate
[02:02:02.920 --> 02:02:07.840]  you well at the same time turning you into a bunch of goons but but but this
[02:02:07.840 --> 02:02:10.480]  has got to be of all the videos I've seen the worst this is out front building

[02:02:28.840 --> 02:02:33.880]  years ago it's in the film Truth Rising and guys that could literally walk right

[02:08:26.800 --> 02:08:34.800]  WABC WOR premiere radio network I mean you name it court TV Air America
[02:08:34.800 --> 02:08:38.520]  everybody knows who Lionel is that's all and I got to the new media seminar at
[02:08:38.520 --> 02:08:42.240]  talkers be the keynote speaker and they're like he's like hi I'm Lionel I'm
[02:08:42.240 --> 02:08:45.800]  there to show a big fan like I wanna who you are but he gave me a pretty good
[02:08:45.800 --> 02:08:48.400]  introduction but I've asked him to come on today with a little light
[02:08:48.400 --> 02:08:52.760]  entertainment to roast me but he wants to talk about serious issues but he says
[02:08:52.760 --> 02:08:56.840]  he doesn't want to make the audience mad I actually like it it's a sick thing
[02:08:56.840 --> 02:09:00.520]  I've admitted it now his stuff is lighthearted and friendly but but I
[02:09:00.520 --> 02:09:04.440]  actually people that really make up outrageous lies about me that's why I'm
[02:09:04.440 --> 02:09:08.040]  not gonna sue the Dallas blog saying I work for Obama when they have no proof
[02:09:08.040 --> 02:09:14.640]  just they just say it's funding so it at a certain level I really like it so
[02:09:14.640 --> 02:09:20.120]  we're gonna be it's it's it's I guess something's wrong with me but but it's
[02:09:20.120 --> 02:09:25.320]  fun to be roasted we're gonna be talking to Lionel of Lionel media comm here in
[02:09:25.320 --> 02:09:29.640]  just a moment but for stations that just joined us earlier there's this big
[02:09:29.640 --> 02:09:33.720]  controversy it out of the thousands of videos out there it's become a national
[02:09:33.720 --> 02:09:40.400]  story with the woman in Rochester in the cops saying you know it's not just get
[02:09:40.400 --> 02:09:44.480]  back and she's on her own property front yard videotaping a cop stopping
[02:09:44.480 --> 02:09:48.400]  people and searching their car and she says she's observing they tell her go
[02:09:48.400 --> 02:09:53.320]  and get back in your house and she says no but starts backing up as they've
[02:09:53.320 --> 02:09:56.280]  said and they still arrest her so I thought I'd play clips where they arrest
[02:09:56.280 --> 02:10:00.200]  news people or threaten to arrest my camera crew or do arrest them in
[02:10:00.200 --> 02:10:04.960]  Pittsburgh totally polite on a hill videotaping demonstrations cops come up
[02:10:04.960 --> 02:10:10.520]  in riot gear and say put the camera down you're going to jail and and then the
[02:10:10.520 --> 02:10:14.880]  media is always well what was on the camera before that happened just just
[02:10:14.880 --> 02:10:20.880]  any excuse to rationalize this and the point is when your police cease to be
[02:10:20.880 --> 02:10:24.520]  servants of the people become thugs you're living in a tyranny it's very
[02:10:24.520 --> 02:10:28.480]  elementary now going back to this clip from truth rising this is Luke
[02:10:28.480 --> 02:10:35.040]  Radowski with a few we are change members out there with a sign saying Larry
[02:10:35.040 --> 02:10:39.120]  Silverstein you know said pull building 7 and they've already been out there
[02:10:39.120 --> 02:10:43.360]  before they've been harassed the cops have come before there it's legal and
[02:10:43.360 --> 02:10:46.720]  lawful for them to be there they even go and get the permit like they're
[02:10:46.720 --> 02:10:52.280]  supposed to and here come private security people saying we're gonna say
[02:10:52.280 --> 02:10:55.760]  you have a bomb we've called the police the police get there and the police
[02:10:55.760 --> 02:10:59.000]  agree they say yes we're gonna say your backpacks a bomb and we're gonna say
[02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:03.960]  your camera's a gun and they grab it away and say look you know we found a
[02:11:03.960 --> 02:11:08.080]  gun and they said now leave or we're gonna charge you so here are the cops
[02:11:08.080 --> 02:11:11.360]  involved in a fake bomb threat that's a violation of federal law of the Patriot
[02:11:11.360 --> 02:11:16.320]  Act here are the Silverstein people at least the one guy saying I know you
[02:11:16.320 --> 02:11:19.680]  don't have a bomb but I'm gonna say you do and it's gonna be 30 days in the
[02:11:19.680 --> 02:11:23.600]  hole we'll finish the clip go to Lionel but here is the audio and video folks
[02:11:23.600 --> 02:11:27.240]  want to see the video become a prison planet dot TV subscriber you can see
[02:11:27.240 --> 02:11:31.240]  the whole film or hey go to YouTube it's free at YouTube but you might want to
[02:11:31.240 --> 02:11:35.160]  buy the DVD and support us at info wars commas I said earlier you know
[02:11:35.160 --> 02:11:38.600]  sometime we've got to get some funds into this operation to continue so we
[02:11:38.600 --> 02:11:43.080]  can continue to expose things like this so what's so important about this is
[02:11:43.080 --> 02:11:47.200]  now the New York police at least this this this gaggle Port Authority police
[02:11:47.200 --> 02:11:56.040]  have gotten so corrupt that they involve themselves in in in in literal
[02:11:56.040 --> 02:12:01.120]  official oppression threatening to frame someone with private security guns
[02:12:01.120 --> 02:12:06.320]  that look like they came out of a good fellas movie on video and then don't
[02:12:06.320 --> 02:12:10.000]  even take the camera away so so they think this is just standard procedure
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:18.000]  do it in front of God and everybody else here it is it's it's a public sidewalk
[02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:22.640]  you take my picture I have every right to you're in a public sidewalk I'm a
[02:12:22.640 --> 02:12:28.240]  citizen everybody we're out here before so I don't mean over some disrespect can
[02:12:28.240 --> 02:12:31.120]  you take your camera out of my face because you're disrespecting me by doing
[02:12:31.120 --> 02:12:35.320]  it so I'm not doing anything legal and he's in his place right now politely can
[02:12:35.320 --> 02:12:45.760]  you take the camera out of my face all right you have every right to know we're
[02:12:45.760 --> 02:12:55.320]  not doing anything legal we have every right to know what it's Ricky comes I
[02:12:55.320 --> 02:13:03.360]  think he's got a bomb in his bag exactly I saw why it was right there now if you
[02:13:03.360 --> 02:13:07.160]  just joined us earlier I played the clip where they say Larry doesn't like your
[02:13:07.160 --> 02:13:10.680]  Larry Silverstein and and now they're saying I think he's got a bomb they
[02:13:10.680 --> 02:13:14.980]  look I goes oh yeah there is a bomb let's continue I'm
[02:13:15.920 --> 02:13:19.840]  guy even admitted you know I know you're not a terrorist but I'm gonna say you're
[02:13:19.840 --> 02:13:23.080]  a terrorist and you're gonna spend 30 days in a hole before they really find
[02:13:23.080 --> 02:13:36.720]  out you'll be in a hole for 30 days I mean just understand
[02:13:36.720 --> 02:13:45.040]  he's still reported me come on you have every right sir I'm sorry but
[02:13:45.040 --> 02:13:55.600]  constitutionally illegally we have every right this is going to jail guess it's
[02:13:55.600 --> 02:14:00.240]  that's enough as it goes on in the cops come they go along with the fake bomb
[02:14:00.240 --> 02:14:04.320]  scare grab the camera say it's a gun but then they have another camera up down
[02:14:04.320 --> 02:14:10.560]  the street 20 yards away that catches all that I mean this is insanity now this
[02:14:10.560 --> 02:14:13.760]  is probably the most evil video I've ever caught with police and private
[02:14:13.760 --> 02:14:18.280]  security working together out in the open trying to frame somebody and he
[02:14:18.280 --> 02:14:21.840]  says I know you don't have a bomb but by the time they figure it out you'll be
[02:14:21.840 --> 02:14:28.920]  in the hole for 30 days I mean like a gangster from a loony toons cartoon hey
[02:14:28.920 --> 02:14:32.320]  bugsy look what we did to him and get the cops over here they work for the
[02:14:32.320 --> 02:14:36.720]  boys hey cops game we're gonna say they got bomb how's that sound because I
[02:14:36.720 --> 02:14:45.040]  was good right now we're gonna show these people but the whole video is
[02:14:45.040 --> 02:14:49.080]  again in truth rising okay ladies and gentlemen and when he is a lawyer we'll
[02:14:49.080 --> 02:14:52.840]  get his take on that get us some serious issues and about begging perhaps a bit
[02:14:52.840 --> 02:14:58.920]  of a roasting Lionelmedia.com he's a ex-prosecutor and criminal defense

[02:18:52.880 --> 02:18:57.520]  a delivery system that the mainstream media folks better pay attention to
[02:18:57.520 --> 02:19:02.720]  because this is not the future this is the present disguised as a future well
[02:19:02.720 --> 02:19:06.040]  I know what do you want to get into first you want to roast me first or you

[02:19:30.520 --> 02:19:34.160]  there with their bagels you notice the people who are around the bagels and
[02:19:34.160 --> 02:19:38.040]  refreshment table the snorers as they're called you're getting it for free so
[02:19:38.040 --> 02:19:41.920]  they walk and they sit down and tell you Alex don't yeah okay I've heard of them
[02:19:41.920 --> 02:19:48.960]  and all of a sudden it was Elmer Gantry on speed meet Howard Beale meets
[02:19:48.960 --> 02:19:54.360]  whatever and they didn't know what to make out of it and I said that's my boy
[02:19:54.360 --> 02:19:59.880]  that's Alex that's the way to do it so anyway as we were talking people said
[02:19:59.880 --> 02:20:02.760]  you know I and and let me tell you something in this mysterious and and
[02:20:02.760 --> 02:20:06.840]  Michael Harrison of talkers and others are paying attention to this you know
[02:20:06.840 --> 02:20:11.040]  how much as I get older my my hearing is getting bad and I don't mean my
[02:20:11.040 --> 02:20:15.600]  auditory hearing I mean I get bored real easy so I need something to rev me up
[02:20:15.600 --> 02:20:19.040]  and I'm gonna say something I have not listened to conventional talk radio and
[02:20:19.040 --> 02:20:24.840]  maybe 20 something years seriously a whole show from anybody it bores me to
[02:20:24.840 --> 02:20:28.720]  death in fact do not waterboard me should you ever want to torture me
[02:20:28.720 --> 02:20:32.920]  Cheney don't want to board me or stress the positions just put on any
[02:20:32.920 --> 02:20:37.400]  conventional mainstream media talk show and I will tell you anything you want
[02:20:37.400 --> 02:20:42.760]  to know within five minutes just turn that off it's white noise it's blather
[02:20:42.760 --> 02:20:49.080]  it's a rope repetition it is mind-fearing mind-numbing audio white noise and it
[02:20:49.080 --> 02:20:53.240]  but you come along and like I said I'm I'm I'm as you can see what it's done to
[02:20:53.240 --> 02:20:56.680]  me right now so anyway so here you come along and I told people I said what you
[02:20:56.680 --> 02:21:00.280]  have to do is there are some moments of the Alex Jones show which I think are
[02:21:00.280 --> 02:21:06.160]  the most fantastic my I love when you say get watching on the phone now that's
[02:21:06.160 --> 02:21:10.720]  the best I tell people pay attention to this point all watching buses are I
[02:21:10.720 --> 02:21:14.760]  don't know where he is I don't know what he's doing one time he was on his
[02:21:14.760 --> 02:21:19.760]  honeymoon I recall her ball Joseph Watson just down on the phone and he's a
[02:21:19.760 --> 02:21:23.840]  very very gentlemanly British make young man as you know when you said what's
[02:21:23.840 --> 02:21:29.800]  it Alex yes listen I'm in the middle of my honeymoon as we speak Alex I don't
[02:21:29.800 --> 02:21:33.400]  want to go with detail all right watch it I want you to do something to break
[02:21:33.400 --> 02:21:36.600]  this down watching their microwaving kittens in
[02:21:36.600 --> 02:21:42.200]  Aldovia and selling them to what he said you were being up Alex I don't talk
[02:21:42.200 --> 02:21:46.520]  right now I'd love to do this all right you make a point that Watson get on it
[02:21:46.520 --> 02:21:51.120]  right away Watson right now have it and you hear the man pleading with you
[02:21:51.120 --> 02:21:55.880]  please Alex just give me my honeymoon and it's like listen we we are on a
[02:21:55.880 --> 02:21:59.000]  mission and we're gonna get down to business and you can have your honeymoon
[02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:04.040]  later he was actually in bed and I wasn't thinking that I was even on radio
[02:22:04.040 --> 02:22:09.040]  it was like that was on radio and I guess he's like it's midnight Alex I'm in
[02:22:09.040 --> 02:22:17.080]  bed Alex never stopped and I'm not seriously let me tell you another
[02:22:17.080 --> 02:22:22.600]  another example of why you are you are story is so important and I have told
[02:22:22.600 --> 02:22:26.960]  people about this stuff and what you have done is you are believe it or not
[02:22:26.960 --> 02:22:31.200]  almost like a NASCAR even talk to somebody who's never heard of NASCAR
[02:22:31.200 --> 02:22:36.080]  they think it's some good old boy goat roper in the middle of nowhere or
[02:22:36.080 --> 02:22:41.240]  like smoking a bandit and then they become aware of the enormity of it and
[02:22:41.240 --> 02:22:46.920]  they say to themselves where have I said you're like that and this other media are
[02:22:46.920 --> 02:22:52.320]  like that you came along a while back with TSA grope it all right so I said
[02:22:52.320 --> 02:22:58.680]  this is not there now I am as I said as you said a the next prosecutor that
[02:22:58.680 --> 02:23:04.760]  scared me more when I saw what people could do Alex in the name of us in the
[02:23:04.760 --> 02:23:08.600]  name of the flag in the name of a government in the name of law and order
[02:23:08.600 --> 02:23:12.720]  the subjugation little by little the systematic subjugation of people's
[02:23:12.720 --> 02:23:17.760]  rights and almost applauded to by people who don't know any better who think
[02:23:17.760 --> 02:23:22.800]  they're they're supporting you know Andy from Mayberry who think that they're
[02:23:22.800 --> 02:23:26.520]  supporting something and cops are not bad I mean I was a part of that system
[02:23:26.520 --> 02:23:31.120]  but anyway but you came along with this TSA but now sure enough my wife and I
[02:23:31.120 --> 02:23:36.480]  were in Tampa my hometown and everything was fine we left we're going to Tampa
[02:23:36.480 --> 02:23:42.640]  left Newark and everything was fine coming through sure enough they look at
[02:23:42.640 --> 02:23:47.360]  my wife who was most attractive yes I met your wife she is she's she's quite
[02:23:47.360 --> 02:23:53.240]  the number she certainly is and and and and believe me I'm the luckiest man on
[02:23:53.240 --> 02:23:57.000]  the world or in the world rather or on the world but anyway so he looks at me
[02:23:57.000 --> 02:24:00.880]  I'm going through the Magnetometer and these going through the Magnetometer
[02:24:00.880 --> 02:24:05.320]  Uber pie everybody's going through it all of a sudden this fellow looks at her
[02:24:05.320 --> 02:24:10.960]  and says you we want to give you this scan now we had talked about it and you
[02:24:10.960 --> 02:24:15.080]  had alerted me to this and I'm thinking wait a minute this is a backscatter
[02:24:15.080 --> 02:24:20.760]  radiation this is a rapid scan this is chertoff baby this is this is not some
[02:24:20.760 --> 02:24:27.040]  mild passive little this is radiation uncalibrated uncertified virtually
[02:24:27.040 --> 02:24:30.880]  unknown I don't know what you're blasting at me and they're recording the
[02:24:30.880 --> 02:24:36.560]  images of her naked body yeah I mean you know we knew all about that thanks to
[02:24:36.560 --> 02:24:42.320]  Alex Joe at least you have to know what ask her and pay her money to be in there
[02:24:42.320 --> 02:24:46.680]  well especially now because as you know Lou he was not doing too well in this
[02:24:46.680 --> 02:24:51.440]  person like anyway so sure enough they do this well when she dares to say I'm
[02:24:51.440 --> 02:24:58.040]  not going to go through that he again all of a sudden it's like a sheriff but
[02:24:58.040 --> 02:25:04.000]  boss hog it's like the Milgram experiment Alex the Stanford prison all of a
[02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:11.400]  sudden this glorified skycap federalized I don't know who he is all of a
[02:25:11.400 --> 02:25:16.240]  sudden this guy's authority is being contested by some little lady and he
[02:25:16.240 --> 02:25:24.600]  talks to me with me we've got an opt-out I cannot believe it's like in
[02:25:24.600 --> 02:25:28.480]  stars it's like a Star Trek whenever the engine room is blowing up they're
[02:25:28.480 --> 02:25:37.000]  like running around alert and people look at it what has she done and she
[02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:41.320]  says why are you doing this to me what are you doing now understand something
[02:25:41.320 --> 02:25:46.040]  this is the most amazing I said now let me get this straight sparky let me get
[02:25:46.040 --> 02:25:49.560]  this straight which is a great way to start off all cross examination you're
[02:25:49.560 --> 02:25:54.440]  telling me that because she has opted out for this particular type of
[02:25:54.440 --> 02:25:59.520]  inspection the very inspection the magnetometer which you prefer in ninety
[02:25:59.520 --> 02:26:06.800]  nine point nine percent of the time that is not good you must physically grow
[02:26:06.800 --> 02:26:13.720]  per to look for what now of course I'm taking picture I'm taking pictures with
[02:26:13.720 --> 02:26:18.240]  thank God for the iPhone unless Steve Jobs gets ahold of that and ruins that
[02:26:18.240 --> 02:26:22.480]  little ability to record life I think it's called the first amendment they're
[02:26:22.480 --> 02:26:26.440]  now trying to have a little spy systems that block you being able to record
[02:26:26.440 --> 02:26:32.360]  continue and Alex thanks to you and I mentioned this online on media dot com I
[02:26:32.360 --> 02:26:36.800]  mentioned this on my 90 commentary people don't and you you must run into this as
[02:26:36.800 --> 02:26:41.720]  well people think you're making this up what are you you're making this up
[02:26:41.720 --> 02:26:47.160]  making it up it's true I wish I was making it up so anyway now later on to
[02:26:47.160 --> 02:26:52.240]  give you an idea I said this to my friend have you ever been to Israel Alex I
[02:26:52.240 --> 02:26:58.160]  know I haven't okay I've been twice now let me tell you something when you talk
[02:26:58.160 --> 02:27:04.840]  about real good at this stuff at the Ben-Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv they could
[02:27:04.840 --> 02:27:09.960]  do Alex anything they wanted and believe me most people would say you know they've
[02:27:09.960 --> 02:27:14.760]  got every right in the world they could physically search you I mean they they
[02:27:14.760 --> 02:27:19.800]  could do internal searching if they want it but they don't even they don't do it
[02:27:19.800 --> 02:27:25.240]  because they put their emphasis on intelligence but think about that when
[02:27:25.240 --> 02:27:29.360]  you have somebody who used to be in charge of the Department of Homeland
[02:27:29.360 --> 02:27:35.560]  Security this mega robbing naggy and huge governmental colossus who goes in
[02:27:35.560 --> 02:27:40.160]  the private practice or private the lobby and all of a sudden has this
[02:27:40.160 --> 02:27:45.680]  unique ability to introduce these rapists can't by the way there was a I
[02:27:45.680 --> 02:27:49.520]  believe it was a Columbia University medical professor who said that
[02:27:49.520 --> 02:27:53.680]  especially areas of the head which are very very sensitive to this type of
[02:27:53.680 --> 02:27:57.800]  ionized radiation which we don't know how strong it is how well we don't know
[02:27:57.800 --> 02:28:02.720]  anything about it but this is this is very very carcinogenic very or has the
[02:28:02.720 --> 02:28:06.760]  that's even been in the New York Times is 20 to 50 times what they first said
[02:28:06.760 --> 02:28:10.320]  they're not calibrating them or even following federal law to have radiation
[02:28:10.320 --> 02:28:15.200]  tests in every month and they gave Congress fake test and then of course on
[02:28:15.200 --> 02:28:18.600]  top of it what about the workers that are around it they're the ones that are
[02:28:18.600 --> 02:28:23.120]  really being fried but hey why do they care let me tell you something I told
[02:28:23.120 --> 02:28:25.720]  this guy what time I said let me tell you to me my friend believe it or not I
[02:28:25.720 --> 02:28:29.840]  said these people don't don't you're a young man I don't blame you because you
[02:28:29.840 --> 02:28:34.400]  know how much you look at these people and I don't think they go into this one
[02:28:34.400 --> 02:28:40.040]  team to to to be you know the stormtrooper s I don't want to bring in
[02:28:40.040 --> 02:28:43.880]  Nazi imagery I don't think they start off like this but what happens is that
[02:28:43.880 --> 02:28:48.800]  let me tell you something my friend it is a word agent orange mean anything to
[02:28:48.800 --> 02:28:55.320]  you what does the lid am I what how how mission how comatose are you what are
[02:28:55.320 --> 02:28:59.440]  these days you're gonna find some wrong that growth in your axilla your armpit
[02:28:59.440 --> 02:29:04.720]  and they're gonna they're gonna deny deny deny deny and you're standing there
[02:29:04.720 --> 02:29:08.600]  when you could have an x-ray at the dentist they put something on your lap
[02:29:08.600 --> 02:29:11.920]  they don't care about you and what's happening I like that this is the most
[02:29:11.920 --> 02:29:19.040]  important I it's tragic but it's true there is this thing it's almost it's
[02:29:19.040 --> 02:29:25.480]  almost scuderian the systematic habituation they're ratcheting up of
[02:29:25.480 --> 02:29:32.320]  more and more control more and more submission subjugating your rights
[02:29:32.320 --> 02:29:38.160]  relinquishing your rights for a comment for a better good terrorism for for this

[02:33:37.840 --> 02:33:42.700]  YouTube I think Twitter is kind of another universe but you want to see
[02:33:42.700 --> 02:33:47.280]  photos of my French Bulldog and also late night rants it's all up there on
[02:33:47.280 --> 02:33:51.600]  the Twitter account also every week now on Tuesday we send out a special report
[02:33:51.600 --> 02:33:58.560]  at Info Wars Insider and we are sent an exclusive you know high death not the
[02:33:58.560 --> 02:34:03.000]  live streams from Bilderberg but the first Bilderberg footage we've released
[02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:06.920]  since we got back five minutes of some of the most powerful information we're
[02:34:06.920 --> 02:34:12.200]  gonna be releasing more via that email you sign up for free at info wars.com
[02:34:12.200 --> 02:34:16.400]  up at the right hand corner we don't do pop-ups and stuff though I'm thinking
[02:34:16.400 --> 02:34:19.720]  about it because it's so important people to sign up for this because Twitter
[02:34:19.720 --> 02:34:25.800]  consensus YouTube consensus from the tech folks I've talked to email is the
[02:34:25.800 --> 02:34:32.960]  best old low-tech high-tech way to send video audio news blast we're gonna it's
[02:34:32.960 --> 02:34:38.240]  gonna become a daily email seven days a week I'm in the process of hiring some
[02:34:38.240 --> 02:34:44.920]  more writers and video editors and folks right now try to beef up the crew because
[02:34:44.920 --> 02:34:48.920]  over time some folks move or you know move on so as we gain more people's
[02:34:48.920 --> 02:34:52.000]  knows we lose people but we're we're busy building it out right now so if you
[02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:55.520]  want to get the info wars insider the first report was on Bilderberg the second
[02:34:55.520 --> 02:35:00.080]  report was the world war three looming report big detailed boil down and then
[02:35:00.080 --> 02:35:04.480]  exclusive video that's on our own servers and we got a big report coming up
[02:35:04.480 --> 02:35:10.040]  later in the week from Bilderberg that's gonna be at prisonplanet.tv we are
[02:35:10.040 --> 02:35:14.960]  gonna be posting at prisonplanet.tv tomorrow the full with expanded
[02:35:14.960 --> 02:35:21.800]  interviews of my speech there at the talkers event that's gonna be on
[02:35:21.800 --> 02:35:26.200]  prisonplanet.tv and we're doing a lot of other special reports and it is your
[02:35:26.200 --> 02:35:30.920]  membership at prisonplanet.tv that does finance much of this broadcast you
[02:35:30.920 --> 02:35:36.640]  know you can get most of what we put out for free at info wars at prisonplanet
[02:35:36.640 --> 02:35:41.800]  at the YouTube sites but you get it first and in higher quality and a higher
[02:35:41.800 --> 02:35:45.800]  quality audio podcast in my book and Paul Watson's book and a lot of other
[02:35:45.800 --> 02:35:51.000]  films were authorized to post and my films first at prisonplanet.tv and it's
[02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:54.880]  important with the internet kill switch and the open calls the sensor
[02:35:54.880 --> 02:35:59.560]  alternative information and YouTube saying we were racist and that they were
[02:35:59.560 --> 02:36:03.320]  gonna shut our account down and we showed the letter because the Obama
[02:36:03.320 --> 02:36:08.600]  poster of him as a joker is racist according to YouTube I threatened legal
[02:36:08.600 --> 02:36:12.840]  action against them for violations of terms of service and defamation and they
[02:36:12.840 --> 02:36:17.720]  removed that we got the letter today they took our honors away of being one of
[02:36:17.720 --> 02:36:21.920]  the number one channels number one in many of the categories and I'm not
[02:36:21.920 --> 02:36:26.680]  litigious folks but you know one time when my sister was still in high school
[02:36:26.680 --> 02:36:30.000]  a guy was stalking her to get at me and saying he was gonna kill her and cops
[02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:34.440]  wouldn't do anything so I just sued him that dealt with it real quick you know
[02:36:34.440 --> 02:36:38.360]  somebody says I'm a drug dealer when I don't even use drugs I sue him you know
[02:36:38.360 --> 02:36:42.980]  I mean sometimes I got to do it and because some things are not entertaining
[02:36:42.980 --> 02:36:45.920]  when you're saying I'm a criminal and now if you're saying I work for Obama
[02:36:45.920 --> 02:36:52.640]  that's funny but we need to have our own media system and so people are always
[02:36:52.640 --> 02:36:57.440]  well so what of YouTube censoring you have your own media system I do it cost
[02:36:57.440 --> 02:37:02.760]  15 cents a day 595 a month get a yearly membership get three months free so
[02:37:02.760 --> 02:37:07.000]  yes I give it to everyone and then I say if you'd like it in higher quality and
[02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:09.760]  to get it first and you believe in what we're doing and you want us to have our
[02:37:09.760 --> 02:37:14.040]  own system prison planet TV and we couldn't do what we're doing without all

[02:37:18.160 --> 02:37:21.080]  been adding things some of the stuff that was six seven years old we found
[02:37:21.080 --> 02:37:24.560]  out was dead links we've up because when we upgraded it killed some of the links
[02:37:24.560 --> 02:37:29.120]  where that's been fixed and we're gonna we now have some of the videos in real
[02:37:29.120 --> 02:37:33.120]  high-def not that many of you have connections fast enough to download
[02:37:33.120 --> 02:37:37.480]  those quickly but we've got that we're gonna go to an all-acart system prison

[02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:21.000]  TV membership now going back to Lionel I know you've been exposing as a former
[02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:25.160]  prosecutor the fraudulent drug war I know you're also concerned about this
[02:38:25.160 --> 02:38:29.240]  rash of police not just arresting folks in their own front yards but beating
[02:38:29.240 --> 02:38:35.320]  reporters up to a pulp when they try to videotape them even from a hundred yards
[02:38:35.320 --> 02:38:39.720]  away or private security guards coming up at city parks and saying we're gonna
[02:38:39.720 --> 02:38:44.520]  arrest you if you don't stop videotaping I mean they're acting like that the new
[02:38:44.520 --> 02:38:49.840]  al-qaeda is anybody with a video camera well see that that's exactly what you
[02:38:49.840 --> 02:38:54.120]  know Alex just a couple of things I wanted just if I could just to piggyback
[02:38:54.120 --> 02:38:58.360]  on what you were saying you know you are excuse me you are you are your your whole
[02:38:58.360 --> 02:39:04.800]  set of in fact I watch it I love what you do you inspired me since 88 I was
[02:39:04.800 --> 02:39:08.160]  involved in conventionals are best for your talk radio play no talk radio and
[02:39:08.160 --> 02:39:12.720]  I thought of myself and I'm serious about this is it I want to do my own
[02:39:12.720 --> 02:39:18.160]  podcasting to say what I want not that I've been censored so much but you'd be
[02:39:18.160 --> 02:39:21.880]  surprised just when you can talk without having somebody in the other room
[02:39:21.880 --> 02:39:26.400]  up let's say a program director stare at you or somebody on a class tour there's
[02:39:26.400 --> 02:39:29.000]  something like when you're in the middle of an impassioned speech is some girls
[02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:34.080]  scout troop walks through or you've got a salesman or you have to stop just in
[02:39:34.080 --> 02:39:36.400]  the middle of what you're doing because you're going to take a break which is
[02:39:36.400 --> 02:39:41.160]  fine I love commerce I love capitalism that's great so what you did was when I
[02:39:41.160 --> 02:39:45.880]  formed Lionel media calm you inspired me and I could do my podcast in its
[02:39:45.880 --> 02:39:51.480]  nominal take the cost of a I think it's a maybe a Starbucks a month but this is
[02:39:51.480 --> 02:39:55.080]  this is what's happening and what I was saying by the way just quickly before we
[02:39:55.080 --> 02:40:02.960]  if I could what I did mention about you in our talkers introduction at the new
[02:40:02.960 --> 02:40:07.380]  media seminar which believe me I don't think in its history because Michael
[02:40:07.380 --> 02:40:12.820]  Harrison did this and he it is the preeminent talk radio talk spoken
[02:40:12.820 --> 02:40:16.760]  word journal on the market but what you've done is I said it's kind of
[02:40:16.760 --> 02:40:20.560]  impassioned it's not like a joke but you have literally figured every means of
[02:40:20.560 --> 02:40:24.800]  communication if smoke signals could ever be tapped you're going to be doing
[02:40:24.800 --> 02:40:31.080]  smoke signals if nanotechnology if if goldfish play this somehow gave out a
[02:40:31.080 --> 02:40:38.520]  message you're going to conquer that you do the DVDs carry your vision tapping
[02:40:38.520 --> 02:40:43.400]  on cell walls in prisons if two people can communicate the two cups in the
[02:40:43.400 --> 02:40:49.840]  string and I say that because you have saturated this thing and people say how
[02:40:49.840 --> 02:40:55.360]  does this guy do it and I'm saying this is the most important thing this isn't
[02:40:55.360 --> 02:41:00.320]  an act but people have to understand about what you're doing and I know this
[02:41:00.320 --> 02:41:05.480]  sounds like I'm not being praiseworthy this is true you can't do Alex what
[02:41:05.480 --> 02:41:12.320]  you're doing unless you really believe it because you're the veneer will come
[02:41:12.320 --> 02:41:17.440]  off and you'll be able to see through the transparency so quickly if you don't
[02:41:17.440 --> 02:41:23.240]  literally eat sleep breathe what you're saying and that's something which is a
[02:41:23.240 --> 02:41:27.600]  key I want everybody to talk radio industry to to listen to what you're
[02:41:27.600 --> 02:41:31.240]  saying if you ever met somebody Alex who says oh hell I can do what you're
[02:41:31.240 --> 02:41:38.120]  doing you just talk for three hours that's easy really sparky I'll tell
[02:41:38.120 --> 02:41:42.920]  you what you do you go into a bathroom right now and you start talking and do
[02:41:42.920 --> 02:41:47.760]  not miss a beat don't bore them don't have them click away because it's that
[02:41:47.760 --> 02:41:52.880]  nine million channels that I suppose with more apps than you can imagine lure
[02:41:52.880 --> 02:41:59.560]  them compel them pardon me hold them over hour after hour never bore them be
[02:41:59.560 --> 02:42:05.200]  sincere and you do it and Alex only you would notice have you ever felt when
[02:42:05.200 --> 02:42:10.080]  you're done doing it three hour broadcast and you are at you are at to
[02:42:10.080 --> 02:42:15.640]  you spinal tabling go at 11 from the get-go do you ever find yourself feeling
[02:42:15.640 --> 02:42:21.360]  like you like your brain's been cord you are emotionally spent you it is a
[02:42:21.360 --> 02:42:27.360]  feeling of almost the mental emotional no that's why no that's it's almost
[02:42:27.360 --> 02:42:30.640]  every day that's why I went from I got greedy because all because once I'm on
[02:42:30.640 --> 02:42:34.000]  air I have all these points I want to make and I get mad that I didn't cover
[02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:39.600]  this issue I didn't my biggest drive is people being conned I get upset by it
[02:42:39.600 --> 02:42:44.720]  and and and I don't like snakes and con artists and all of their fakery so I
[02:42:44.720 --> 02:42:48.280]  want to show people the magic trick but then I realized that I didn't do it
[02:42:48.280 --> 02:42:53.040]  properly I didn't tell them all of it and then I feel guilty and so then I'll
[02:42:53.040 --> 02:42:56.600]  all do a fourth hour and then it's gotten to where over the years I have to
[02:42:56.600 --> 02:42:59.760]  go lay down on a couch for like 30 minutes and on the way to the couch
[02:42:59.760 --> 02:43:03.200]  there's salesman popping up and your wife's on the phone and you're she just
[02:43:03.200 --> 02:43:08.200]  dropped the children off and by the way there's a city inspector here and and
[02:43:08.200 --> 02:43:14.200]  you know two employees are fighting in the back and I mean absolutely and and
[02:43:14.200 --> 02:43:19.400]  Paul Watson got his honeymoon Paul Paul but I gotta tell you something
[02:43:19.400 --> 02:43:23.640]  if there is something about this business if you do it right it's
[02:43:23.640 --> 02:43:29.120]  something that it is so important I want to be corny for a moment I think
[02:43:29.120 --> 02:43:33.400]  corny because I'm afraid of of two things I think you and I are very alike
[02:43:33.400 --> 02:43:37.520]  in this respect first of all have you ever done a perfect show I bet you'll
[02:43:37.520 --> 02:43:42.160]  say no no they're horrible if you if you ever think you think how did I do that
[02:43:42.160 --> 02:43:46.040]  how did I leave that out because that's a perfection you've only got this amount
[02:43:46.040 --> 02:43:50.920]  of time and you treat each broadcast I get your last I get the only one oh does
[02:43:50.920 --> 02:43:55.160]  this happen every time I want to go on a trip I'm not afraid of death I get
[02:43:55.160 --> 02:43:58.960]  afraid I can die in a plane crash so I always do a whole bunch of extra stuff
[02:43:58.960 --> 02:44:02.760]  right before I leave I know well you know one of the things that you and I
[02:44:02.760 --> 02:44:06.960]  share and by the way another thing I tell people you could always tell a lot
[02:44:06.960 --> 02:44:11.080]  about a show by the bumper music and you and I didn't share an affinity for the
[02:44:11.080 --> 02:44:15.720]  Polaroid of Texas Towns Van Zandt and I thought how appropriate when I think of
[02:44:15.720 --> 02:44:19.880]  you I think you know all the federalities say we could have had him any
[02:44:19.880 --> 02:44:24.120]  day and isn't how it is how interesting how prescient and vatic and
[02:44:24.120 --> 02:44:28.800]  typhonic that is that poncho and lefty and how that is in many respect
[02:44:28.800 --> 02:44:33.360]  correlates to what you're doing because I keep thinking and I don't mean this
[02:44:33.360 --> 02:44:38.320]  please I don't mean this I don't mean to be cute about this because God only
[02:44:38.320 --> 02:44:44.400]  knows what you let go through that the public doesn't know about how your
[02:44:44.400 --> 02:44:49.040]  beloved wife and family must say could you just could you baby just solid
[02:44:49.040 --> 02:44:52.920]  chair and colleagues please you know could you you please you know this is a
[02:44:52.920 --> 02:44:59.680]  great calling but we don't know I'll be very serious the the sacrifices you
[02:44:59.680 --> 02:45:06.280]  make to do this because because I keep telling people you know when you know
[02:45:06.280 --> 02:45:09.240]  that you've said many times you can tell you over the target when you start
[02:45:09.240 --> 02:45:17.280]  taking black and as long as you hear Alex Jones on the air you know he hasn't
[02:45:17.280 --> 02:45:23.880]  hit pay dirt yet when he does you won't hear him anymore so your success is what
[02:45:23.880 --> 02:45:27.680]  we hear a dial tone if they even have dial tones anymore you know I'm saying
[02:45:27.680 --> 02:45:32.720]  it's a weird the government but it's not by the way this not Obama's not Bush
[02:45:32.720 --> 02:45:38.880]  it's the government it's the superstructure it's this it's this amalgam
[02:45:38.880 --> 02:45:44.400]  this Gordian not this hodgepodge this this this almost supernal superstructure
[02:45:44.400 --> 02:45:52.080]  they cannot let this get too popular and ruffle feathers because I gotta tell
[02:45:52.080 --> 02:45:56.400]  you something Alex this is what I say on LionelMedia.com and this Twitter I
[02:45:56.400 --> 02:46:01.040]  love I'm a Twitter fanatic another addiction I've got at LionelMedia this
[02:46:01.040 --> 02:46:07.880]  is my dream not to to in any way steal from Dr. King but I have a dream and
[02:46:07.880 --> 02:46:12.360]  that dream Alex is that one day the government says this when I say the
[02:46:12.360 --> 02:46:14.920]  government it could be 20 years from now whoever can charge it doesn't matter
[02:46:14.920 --> 02:46:19.480]  state local city Austin City Council doesn't matter I want people in office
[02:46:19.480 --> 02:46:24.960]  to say oh no no we can't do this they'll never stand for this they'll be out in
[02:46:24.960 --> 02:46:30.040]  the streets we will kick these people off you don't understand them they breathe
[02:46:30.040 --> 02:46:37.240]  they know they vote oh no no I want the government to be afraid of us I want
[02:46:37.240 --> 02:46:42.840]  them to tremble at the idea of making not Alex Jones or not Lionel or no no
[02:46:42.840 --> 02:46:51.600]  but but anybody upset because it's the opposite we quake we live in fear we are
[02:46:51.600 --> 02:46:55.840]  sheeple we're habituated well I think that's the most successful thing I've
[02:46:55.840 --> 02:46:59.920]  done not even consciously because I'm just outraged and mad and and and it's
[02:46:59.920 --> 02:47:04.160]  not that I even have courage it's in the face of a bully I tend to attack not
[02:47:04.160 --> 02:47:11.480]  run I flee forward really is what it is it is that I've not been fearful and I
[02:47:11.480 --> 02:47:15.320]  think that's been an example of people to stop being cowed and I think the
[02:47:15.320 --> 02:47:19.200]  founding fathers said it V for Vendetta repeated it but George Washington said it
[02:47:19.200 --> 02:47:24.440]  when the government fears the people there is liberty when the people fear
[02:47:24.440 --> 02:47:29.840]  the government there is tyranny and it's really just that simple and and and
[02:47:29.840 --> 02:47:33.960]  government has gotten on a power trip control freaks have filled government
[02:47:33.960 --> 02:47:40.040]  now with bad folks they're trying to kick out the good people and raising that
[02:47:40.040 --> 02:47:44.480]  point specifically as a former prosecutor what's your view of the attack on the
[02:47:44.480 --> 02:47:49.520]  video camera what's your view because you were saying a drug war well this is
[02:47:49.520 --> 02:47:53.920]  the first ball as far as this two years ago Alex there was a there was this
[02:47:53.920 --> 02:47:59.600]  kind of a firewall but there was a time when people actually paid lip service
[02:47:59.600 --> 02:48:06.840]  to this CIA is international FBI is national and I say is this and so that
[02:48:06.840 --> 02:48:11.040]  was this it was an illusory that there was this firewall this compartmentalized
[02:48:11.040 --> 02:48:18.000]  your jurisdiction ends here today some very smart people again think 15 20 year
[02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:22.480]  increments you know this this is that they've got whoever they is but their
[02:48:22.480 --> 02:48:29.000]  things plan the idea is that hey guys I don't have to worry anymore about wire
[02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:34.800]  tap when I was a prosecutor we actually had wire tap this is before technology I
[02:48:34.800 --> 02:48:40.800]  used to prosecute Alex this is in the in the 80s the early well mid 80s I've
[02:48:40.800 --> 02:48:46.560]  seen phone calls well guess what took care of that one caller ID hey isn't that

[02:54:11.040 --> 02:54:17.400]  Jones and the GCN radio network okay not just the internet king but the media
[02:54:17.400 --> 02:54:23.400]  king showing that the alternative media is king drudge report is linked to our
[02:54:23.400 --> 02:54:27.600]  article proving that the TSA said they stopped groping children under 12 last
[02:54:27.600 --> 02:54:31.720]  November and then again in April and now they've told us that it doesn't happen
[02:54:31.720 --> 02:54:35.040]  now even though I just watched it a few weeks ago when I flew to New York here
[02:54:35.040 --> 02:54:40.200]  in Austin and coming back through Newark they're at Liberty or whatever the
[02:54:40.200 --> 02:54:45.360]  name of it is we need to get this added as an update to the drudge linked
[02:54:45.360 --> 02:54:50.400]  article TSA set to take legal action against Texas groping bill they already
[02:54:50.400 --> 02:54:53.720]  had Perry's minion behind the scenes kill it with a unanimous vote in the
[02:54:53.720 --> 02:54:59.360]  house and near unanimous in the Senate I had one vote one vote against it they
[02:54:59.360 --> 02:55:05.440]  had lined up and now because of Perry being put on the hot seat it's set to
[02:55:05.440 --> 02:55:09.720]  be voted on today no no tomorrow excuse me Friday feels like Friday's I never
[02:55:09.720 --> 02:55:15.200]  have a day off so every day is Friday lusting after Saturday but to make a
[02:55:15.200 --> 02:55:19.480]  long story short they're threatening a blockade in a lawsuit kind of like the
[02:55:19.480 --> 02:55:26.400]  feds always do they couldn't pass the EPA carbon tax so they just have the they
[02:55:26.400 --> 02:55:30.120]  have the EPA do it and then states are suing that and the federal courts are
[02:55:30.120 --> 02:55:33.880]  ruling for the EPA people thought that ruling earlier in the week was a good
[02:55:33.880 --> 02:55:38.120]  thing that oh you know some states were calling for more carbon taxes people
[02:55:38.120 --> 02:55:41.800]  had all the feds say only the EPA can decide that no that's terrible they're
[02:55:41.800 --> 02:55:45.440]  saying the states have no authority why even have states then but I digress
[02:55:45.440 --> 02:55:50.760]  vinyl it's awesome having you I'd like to have you you know someday when I kind
[02:55:50.760 --> 02:55:53.440]  of have a smorgasbord of different hosts that film in over the three hours
[02:55:53.440 --> 02:55:58.840]  perhaps have you ride shotgun with Watson so you can tease him the entire time
[02:55:58.840 --> 02:56:03.840]  you know he's the fill-in host how do you like it when Watson fills in I'll
[02:56:03.840 --> 02:56:11.280]  tell you what I I like it I've I've I certainly you you cannot replace you but
[02:56:11.280 --> 02:56:15.040]  may I say something very quickly about why this is very important why this TSA
[02:56:15.040 --> 02:56:18.840]  thing is it is very important for this particular and again not the Obama
[02:56:18.840 --> 02:56:22.260]  administration the government whoever replaces them will do the same thing
[02:56:22.260 --> 02:56:30.320]  Alex they cannot win there has to be the message sent out that any attempt to
[02:56:30.320 --> 02:56:38.600]  thwart to intercept to stop to interrupt the systematic complete control of
[02:56:38.600 --> 02:56:42.360]  people their bodies their persons their communications or computers their apple
[02:56:42.360 --> 02:56:47.520]  everything will be fought viciously to give and whether it means something or
[02:56:47.520 --> 02:56:51.080]  not there might be people in the halls of justice somewhere that said we don't
[02:56:51.080 --> 02:56:56.520]  care about TSA it doesn't matter we're going to teach these people a lesson we
[02:56:56.520 --> 02:57:02.400]  are not going to let anything go how dare you question your government we're
[02:57:02.400 --> 02:57:09.080]  not a public servant we're in charge your minions your slaves how dare you
[02:57:09.080 --> 02:57:13.600]  question us well they call it anti-government to even have an opinion
[02:57:13.600 --> 02:57:17.080]  about what you want in government but that's what freedom is all about in
[02:57:17.080 --> 02:57:21.120]  closing and again folks we're gonna I'm gonna put up some special reports today
[02:57:21.120 --> 02:57:24.800]  on a host of issues dealing with this big TSA development watch info wars and
[02:57:24.800 --> 02:57:28.640]  prison planet and prison planet TV but in closing next time you come back we'll
[02:57:28.640 --> 02:57:32.000]  talk about it more but briefly your view on the drug war as a former
[02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:38.080]  prosecutor it is absolutely is the most ridiculous weight of time it has resulted
[02:57:38.080 --> 02:57:42.880]  in right now a boom for lawyers and judges and jailers and the like the
[02:57:42.880 --> 02:57:47.200]  reason why the reason why people are involved in drugs is very simple thing
[02:57:47.200 --> 02:57:50.960]  either to use or to sell and they sell to make money and the reason why to make
[02:57:50.960 --> 02:57:55.040]  money is because it's illegal so if you make something legal that is not an
[02:57:55.040 --> 02:57:59.400]  endorsement by the government of its use it just merely means Alex that if you
[02:57:59.400 --> 02:58:03.240]  possess something you are not subject to criminal penalty you know that if one of
[02:58:03.240 --> 02:58:09.360]  your kids god forbid had strict nine on them or or cyanide that may not be
[02:58:09.360 --> 02:58:12.920]  against the law that's not a schedule one drug because it's gonna get you high
[02:58:12.920 --> 02:58:18.160]  it'll kill you but it won't get you high now does that make any sense to you no
[02:58:18.160 --> 02:58:22.040]  there's stuff under every sink that'll kill you better than a hammer but because
[02:58:22.040 --> 02:58:25.480]  they don't hype it up and make it a big deal it statistically it's not very
[02:58:25.480 --> 02:58:29.640]  dangerous look they made the drugs illegal because alcohol prohibition went
[02:58:29.640 --> 02:58:32.880]  out they had to have something else to give the corrupt system a cut of the
[02:58:32.880 --> 02:58:36.120]  laundered money and that's on record with the big banks caught doing it Lionel
[02:58:36.120 --> 02:58:40.240]  awesome having a great job to the crew see you back tomorrow 11 a.m. retransmit it
[02:58:40.240 --> 02:59:09.960]  starts now thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN live.com today.
